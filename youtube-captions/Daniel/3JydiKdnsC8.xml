  <text start="5.069" dur="6.301">video is being recorded on may the 25th</text>
  <text start="7.76" dur="5.919">2013 is the 15th day of the second</text>
  <text start="11.37" dur="5.009">hebrew month the 15th day of the month</text>
  <text start="13.679" dur="6.061">of Zin and I recently made a video</text>
  <text start="16.379" dur="6.031">called the law of Moses is the law of</text>
  <text start="19.74" dur="6">Jesus and in the aftermath of that video</text>
  <text start="22.41" dur="6.959">i received a response from a woman who</text>
  <text start="25.74" dur="6.89">had a problem with my video and did not</text>
  <text start="29.369" dur="6.481">like the gospel i was promoting and</text>
  <text start="32.63" dur="5.74">brought up a passage in scripture to</text>
  <text start="35.85" dur="5.04">show me how I was wrong and I again</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="4.74">wanted to bring forth this private</text>
  <text start="40.89" dur="5.669">exchange in a public forum so that might</text>
  <text start="43.11" dur="7.83">benefit those of you out there so she</text>
  <text start="46.559" dur="6.691">brought up Matthew 5 verse 17 Matthew 5</text>
  <text start="50.94" dur="4.23">or 17 which of course says think not</text>
  <text start="53.25" dur="4.71">that I come to destroy the Torah or the</text>
  <text start="55.17" dur="6.27">prophets I am not come to destroy but to</text>
  <text start="57.96" dur="5.16">fulfill now in her words and this is not</text>
  <text start="61.44" dur="4.95">just her words but it&amp;#39;s the words of</text>
  <text start="63.12" dur="6.3">most of modern-day Christianity that</text>
  <text start="66.39" dur="6.51">word fulfill Jesus fulfilled the law so</text>
  <text start="69.42" dur="5.489">I don&amp;#39;t have to do it Jesus fulfilled</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="5.009">the commandments he came to the Phillips</text>
  <text start="74.909" dur="7.051">so I don&amp;#39;t need to do it he did it for</text>
  <text start="77.909" dur="8.221">me this is the fundamental basis of most</text>
  <text start="81.96" dur="5.79">of Christianity Jesus fulfilled keeping</text>
  <text start="86.13" dur="4.169">the Sabbath so I don&amp;#39;t have to do the</text>
  <text start="87.75" dur="6.42">Sabbath Jesus fulfilled eating kosher so</text>
  <text start="90.299" dur="7.89">I can eat whatever I want now this is</text>
  <text start="94.17" dur="6.03">absolutely crazy if you think about it</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="5.811">what the Christian is doing is taking</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="7.559">the atoning sacrifice of Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="104" dur="6.85">using it as just justification to ignore</text>
  <text start="107.759" dur="5.82">and or disobey the commandments I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="110.85" dur="4.74">going to say that again what the</text>
  <text start="113.579" dur="3.93">Christian is doing when they say that</text>
  <text start="115.59" dur="4.86">Jesus fulfilled the law is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="117.509" dur="5.82">taking the atoning sacrifice of Jesus</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="5.94">Christ of Yahshua HaMashiach and using</text>
  <text start="123.329" dur="4.621">that as a justification to disobey the</text>
  <text start="126.39" dur="4.38">commandments or to ignore them</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="4.92">completely and that is exactly what a</text>
  <text start="130.77" dur="2.7">Christian is doing when they say Jesus</text>
  <text start="132.87" dur="3.45">fulfilled</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="5.31">this what they&amp;#39;re really saying is Jesus</text>
  <text start="136.32" dur="5.07">kept Sabbath or Jesus ate kosher or</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="6.78">Jesus did this or that so I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="141.39" dur="7.79">to do it that is not the true gospel nor</text>
  <text start="145.56" dur="7.62">can it be the true gospel is this</text>
  <text start="149.18" dur="7.42">Yahshua&amp;#39;s atoning sacrifice gives me the</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="6.45">freedom to obey his commandments once</text>
  <text start="156.6" dur="5.27">more i was at enmity against his</text>
  <text start="159.63" dur="5.07">commandments but his atoning sacrifice</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="5.74">brings me into a position where i can</text>
  <text start="164.7" dur="6.99">start obeying his commandments once</text>
  <text start="167.61" dur="6.9">again what does this word fulfill mean</text>
  <text start="171.69" dur="6.48">what does that passage mean in Matthew 5</text>
  <text start="174.51" dur="6.66">verse 17 I am not come to destroy but to</text>
  <text start="178.17" dur="5.73">fulfill without question his meaning in</text>
  <text start="181.17" dur="5.82">this place is consistently with all that</text>
  <text start="183.9" dur="5.4">goes before and follows after I am come</text>
  <text start="186.99" dur="5.07">to establish it the so-called Old</text>
  <text start="189.3" dur="5.25">Testament law and come to establish it</text>
  <text start="192.06" dur="5.73">in its fullness in spite of all the</text>
  <text start="194.55" dur="6.15">glasses of men or Jewish inventions and</text>
  <text start="197.79" dur="6.21">traditions I am come to place in full</text>
  <text start="200.7" dur="6.66">and clear view whatsoever was dark and</text>
  <text start="204" dur="6.78">obscure therein I am come to declare the</text>
  <text start="207.36" dur="6.57">true and full import of every part of</text>
  <text start="210.78" dur="6.9">the Old Testament law to show the length</text>
  <text start="213.93" dur="6.72">and breadth the entire extent of every</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="5.88">commandment contained within this law</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="6.18">and the height and death the</text>
  <text start="223.56" dur="7.98">inconceivable purity and spirituality of</text>
  <text start="226.83" dur="7.35">it in all branches I just quoted John</text>
  <text start="231.54" dur="6.509">Wesley by the way that is what that</text>
  <text start="234.18" dur="7.17">passage truly needs now if you press a</text>
  <text start="238.049" dur="5.521">Christian who has a sincere heart on the</text>
  <text start="241.35" dur="4.74">logical fallacy of their position about</text>
  <text start="243.57" dur="4.35">Jesus fulfilling the law usually they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="4.02">if they&amp;#39;re honest with you they&amp;#39;ll admit</text>
  <text start="247.92" dur="3.84">that it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense for</text>
  <text start="250.11" dur="3.54">instance if you say okay so Jesus</text>
  <text start="251.76" dur="3.21">fulfilled the law Jesus fulfilled</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="3.119">keeping Sabbath&amp;#39;s you don&amp;#39;t have to keep</text>
  <text start="254.97" dur="3.9">Sabbath oh yeah yeah I agree with that</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="3.511">Jesus fulfilled eating kosher so you</text>
  <text start="258.87" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t have to eat kosher oh yeah yeah I</text>
  <text start="260.28" dur="5.31">agree that okay so Jesus fulfilled thou</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="3.6">shalt not commit adultery so you can go</text>
  <text start="265.59" dur="3.96">commit adultery</text>
  <text start="266.94" dur="6.3">Jesus fulfilled thou shalt not steal so</text>
  <text start="269.55" dur="5.64">you can go and steal oh no that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="4.47">what I mean but that is the logical</text>
  <text start="275.19" dur="4.53">conclusion of their position of course</text>
  <text start="277.71" dur="3.66">then a Christian will usually say well</text>
  <text start="279.72" dur="5.03">no Daniel you see there&amp;#39;s a difference</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="8.94">between moral civil and ceremonial laws</text>
  <text start="284.75" dur="7.6">what what where is that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="290.31" dur="4.11">Scripture other than in the minds of</text>
  <text start="292.35" dur="5.46">theologians is that division in the</text>
  <text start="294.42" dur="5.67">commandments we&amp;#39;re in the scripture can</text>
  <text start="297.81" dur="5.13">anyone point to me where it says that</text>
  <text start="300.09" dur="6.18">there are moral civil and ceremonial</text>
  <text start="302.94" dur="5.28">laws Yahweh gives these Commandments to</text>
  <text start="306.27" dur="4.8">Moshe he doesn&amp;#39;t make a division between</text>
  <text start="308.22" dur="5.55">moral civil and ceremonial he just gives</text>
  <text start="311.07" dur="4.38">them in fact the commandment to keep the</text>
  <text start="313.77" dur="3.69">Sabbath day the seventh day of the week</text>
  <text start="315.45" dur="4.77">from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown</text>
  <text start="317.46" dur="4.38">is given right alongside the commandment</text>
  <text start="320.22" dur="3.93">to thou shalt not commit adultery and</text>
  <text start="321.84" dur="5.1">thou shalt not still so how can you say</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="6.99">one is moral and one is not that makes</text>
  <text start="326.94" dur="6.93">no sense whatsoever now I will concede</text>
  <text start="331.14" dur="5.34">that there are different Commandments in</text>
  <text start="333.87" dur="6.66">the Torah that apply to different types</text>
  <text start="336.48" dur="5.61">of people for example a farmer has to</text>
  <text start="340.53" dur="3.54">abide by a certain amount of</text>
  <text start="342.09" dur="4.05">Commandments within the Torah that</text>
  <text start="344.07" dur="4.14">applies to his farming obviously if</text>
  <text start="346.14" dur="5.19">you&amp;#39;re not a farmer you wouldn&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="348.21" dur="5.85">keep those Commandments a woman has a</text>
  <text start="351.33" dur="4.71">certain commandments that only apply to</text>
  <text start="354.06" dur="5.25">her during her monthly cycle that</text>
  <text start="356.04" dur="4.98">obviously would not apply to a man there</text>
  <text start="359.31" dur="4.02">are commandments that can only be done</text>
  <text start="361.02" dur="5.22">by a governmental body such as the</text>
  <text start="363.33" dur="4.56">stoning of witches or homosexuals cannot</text>
  <text start="366.24" dur="4.23">be done by individuals but must be done</text>
  <text start="367.89" dur="3.96">by a governmental administration there</text>
  <text start="370.47" dur="4.68">are certain Commandments to only apply</text>
  <text start="371.85" dur="9.36">to Levites or in the context of having a</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="7.68">temple sanctified by Yahweh but there</text>
  <text start="381.21" dur="3.33">are also Commandments within the tour</text>
  <text start="382.83" dur="6.24">that applied to everyone in every</text>
  <text start="384.54" dur="7.92">situation consider Daniel chapter 1</text>
  <text start="389.07" dur="6.33">verse 8 now Daniel was in Babylon he was</text>
  <text start="392.46" dur="6.03">in a foreign land he was unable to for</text>
  <text start="395.4" dur="3.95">instance do any of the animal sacrifices</text>
  <text start="398.49" dur="2.84">that might have been</text>
  <text start="399.35" dur="5.01">because there was no temple and yet we</text>
  <text start="401.33" dur="6.24">know from Daniel chapter 1 verse 8 that</text>
  <text start="404.36" dur="4.92">he kept kosher he would only eat that</text>
  <text start="407.57" dur="4.74">which was clean and Yahweh blessed him</text>
  <text start="409.28" dur="5.43">modely for that we are like Daniel we</text>
  <text start="412.31" dur="4.53">are living in a Babylonian culture and</text>
  <text start="414.71" dur="4.86">so we keep those commandments which we</text>
  <text start="416.84" dur="4.89">can do such as eating kosher such as</text>
  <text start="419.57" dur="5.25">keeping the feast days such as keeping</text>
  <text start="421.73" dur="6.54">an honoring Sabbath but I want to come</text>
  <text start="424.82" dur="7.71">back to my main point will the real</text>
  <text start="428.27" dur="7.38">gospel stand up we have two Gospels here</text>
  <text start="432.53" dur="5.58">one gospel that this woman and that most</text>
  <text start="435.65" dur="6.06">of modern Christianity promotes says</text>
  <text start="438.11" dur="6.54">that the atoning sacrifice of Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="441.71" dur="6.27">the means by which I can ignore or</text>
  <text start="444.65" dur="6.96">disobey the commandments the gospel I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="447.98" dur="6.45">promoting states that by the atoning</text>
  <text start="451.61" dur="5.52">sacrifice of Yahshua this gives me the</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="5.67">freedom and liberty to obey His</text>
  <text start="457.13" dur="5">commandments which gospel are you going</text>
  <text start="460.1" dur="4.55">to stand behind one that allows</text>
  <text start="462.13" dur="6.31">disobedience or one that promotes</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="7.03">obedience I&amp;#39;m going to stand by the one</text>
  <text start="468.44" dur="4.98">that promotes obedience and in fact if</text>
  <text start="471.68" dur="3.63">you continue reading in that very</text>
  <text start="473.42" dur="5.82">passage that I began this YouTube with</text>
  <text start="475.31" dur="6.18">go on to verse 18 in Matthew 5 4 it says</text>
  <text start="479.24" dur="5.01">verily I say unto you until the heavens</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="5.01">and earth pass one jot or one tittle</text>
  <text start="484.25" dur="6.06">shall in no wise pass from the Torah</text>
  <text start="486.5" dur="5.61">till all be fulfilled in other words as</text>
  <text start="490.31" dur="4.38">long as the heavens are above you as</text>
  <text start="492.11" dur="6.24">long as the earth is beneath your feet</text>
  <text start="494.69" dur="6.18">not one jot or tittle from this torah</text>
  <text start="498.35" dur="5.58">these Commandments will pass away I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="500.87" dur="5.7">going to take Jesus at his word I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="503.93" dur="5.97">going to read his words at face value</text>
  <text start="506.57" dur="5.969">and that means that his Commandments</text>
  <text start="509.9" dur="5.79">will not pass away and I will continue</text>
  <text start="512.539" dur="6.241">to promote them out of hold them this is</text>
  <text start="515.69" dur="5.64">the true gospel that anyone who names</text>
  <text start="518.78" dur="6.12">the name of Christ should uphold and</text>
