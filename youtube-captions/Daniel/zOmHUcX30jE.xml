  <text start="134.43" dur="4.18">well there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no room go way up</text>
  <text start="136.989" dur="3.211">there where we are now</text>
  <text start="138.61" dur="4.019">oh yeah I know they they&amp;#39;re very good</text>
  <text start="140.2" dur="4.379">that&amp;#39;s coming within in fact usually the</text>
  <text start="142.629" dur="5.101">before it&amp;#39;s feathers they got the place</text>
  <text start="144.579" dur="6.081">salted and yeah it&amp;#39;s very easy to get</text>
  <text start="147.73" dur="4.79">around as long as you have good tires</text>
  <text start="150.66" dur="4.02">have all those all season snow tires we</text>
  <text start="152.52" dur="4.43">have OHS you can get anywhere around</text>
  <text start="154.68" dur="2.27">here</text>

  <text start="161.349" dur="5.151">weeks ago I had to get</text>
  <text start="164.4" dur="3.66">snow tires because my other side tires</text>
  <text start="166.5" dur="3.12">they all shoot up when they build that</text>
  <text start="168.06" dur="3.36">construction on my Road</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="5.43">I should have technically taken off</text>
  <text start="171.42" dur="5.28">between April and October but I was too</text>
  <text start="175.05" dur="4.25">lazy and I didn&amp;#39;t replace them with my</text>
  <text start="176.7" dur="2.6">regular tires</text>
  <text start="181.47" dur="2.78">shoot up</text>
  <text start="188.36" dur="2.75">invited</text>
  <text start="196.629" dur="3.541">the main thing that people do in Juneau</text>
  <text start="198.459" dur="3.241">the two huge bills are government</text>
  <text start="200.17" dur="4.14">because it&amp;#39;s the seat of government some</text>
  <text start="201.7" dur="4.86">of our government workers or medical</text>
  <text start="204.31" dur="4.679">medical homes may have the Bartlet</text>
  <text start="206.56" dur="5.099">hospital like my fiancee for instance</text>
  <text start="208.989" dur="5.67">she&amp;#39;s a traveler so those are the two</text>
  <text start="211.659" dur="5.491">biggest professions and then the third</text>
  <text start="214.659" dur="4.351">highest which of course is only from May</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="4.08">to October is the tourists tourist</text>
  <text start="219.01" dur="4.229">industry so ironically a lot of people</text>
  <text start="221.23" dur="4.229">that work here in the tourists they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.239" dur="3.631">only here during the tourist season</text>
  <text start="225.459" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re not here they&amp;#39;re not hopefuls</text>
  <text start="226.87" dur="1.96">they don&amp;#39;t live here all year long some</text>
  <text start="228.459" dur="2.571">of them</text>
  <text start="228.83" dur="5.01">a lot of them</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="2.81">back to the dating world</text>
  <text start="234.55" dur="6.59">oh yeah backing down main reason Juno</text>
  <text start="237.37" dur="3.77">found him on the Malthus was</text>
  <text start="242.01" dur="3.47">in fact we learned about that that</text>
  <text start="243.42" dur="5.17">little tiny Museum of it too</text>
  <text start="245.48" dur="3.11">don&amp;#39;t you remember that damn</text>
  <text start="248.71" dur="4.8">so this is all</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="3.18">now we&amp;#39;re getting out again into the</text>
  <text start="253.51" dur="4.55">interlocking Islands that eventually</text>
  <text start="254.83" dur="3.23">speed out into the</text>
  <text start="258.209" dur="4.49">Pacific Ocean proper stall this is</text>
  <text start="260.009" dur="2.69">saltwater here</text>
  <text start="263.04" dur="3.53">you actually walk them to</text>
  <text start="269.78" dur="6.37">oh yeah that&amp;#39;s actually that&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="274.02" dur="5.13">shamon island which i&amp;#39;ve renamed sabbath</text>
  <text start="276.15" dur="6.15">islands and that actually is just a bed</text>
  <text start="279.15" dur="4.739">on a trail yeah I could try out for</text>
  <text start="282.3" dur="3.22">about 250 foot events that you get to</text>
  <text start="283.889" dur="3.831">that</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="4.51">certain times on the title enough you</text>
  <text start="287.72" dur="3.89">can actually walk across the land right</text>
  <text start="290.03" dur="4.09">away</text>
  <text start="291.61" dur="2.51">yep</text>
  <text start="305.01" dur="3.21">so again for those of you joined us for</text>
  <text start="306.69" dur="3.57">part two we&amp;#39;re now heading to the other</text>
  <text start="308.22" dur="4.71">end of Davos island we&amp;#39;ve gone to the</text>
  <text start="310.26" dur="4.11">extreme south end of Juneau itself and</text>
  <text start="312.93" dur="2.58">we&amp;#39;ve gone to the extreme south end of</text>
  <text start="314.37" dur="3.18">Douglas island now we&amp;#39;re heading to the</text>
  <text start="315.51" dur="4.26">north extreme northwest corner of Ellis</text>
  <text start="317.55" dur="3.93">Island Moshe Douglas Island is</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="5.6">wilderness but I&amp;#39;m going as far as we</text>
  <text start="321.48" dur="3.89">can in the developed areas</text>
  <text start="330.57" dur="3.599">but you they had a blast all that out to</text>
  <text start="332.79" dur="3.719">put this room</text>
  <text start="334.169" dur="4.321">that&amp;#39;s why that&amp;#39;s really why there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="336.509" dur="3.511">a road that links us to Canada to the</text>
  <text start="338.49" dur="3.95">mainland from here because it would be</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="3.86">so expensive</text>
  <text start="342.44" dur="3.42">billions of dollars that last through</text>
  <text start="343.88" dur="3.81">the either the Canadian mountains going</text>
  <text start="345.86" dur="4.26">east or more likely if never been eroded</text>
  <text start="347.69" dur="5.22">would go due north up to Haines</text>
  <text start="350.12" dur="3.93">and if you get to Haines which today to</text>
  <text start="352.91" dur="2.37">get to aim to get to get a from ferry</text>
  <text start="354.05" dur="3.99">that takes about six hours to get</text>
  <text start="355.28" dur="4.11">obtains but</text>
  <text start="358.04" dur="2.91">if it had a road that linked us to</text>
  <text start="359.39" dur="3.45">Haines then pains you can actually get</text>
  <text start="360.95" dur="3.32">on the Canadian highway system from</text>
  <text start="362.84" dur="3.05">there</text>
  <text start="364.27" dur="3.15">into the northern tip of British</text>
  <text start="365.89" dur="6.339">Columbia up in the Yukon you can get out</text>
  <text start="367.42" dur="6.64">into the other areas of Alaska but</text>
  <text start="372.229" dur="3.541">they&amp;#39;ve squashed that trying to build</text>
  <text start="374.06" dur="4.829">that because it&amp;#39;s just the money expense</text>
  <text start="375.77" dur="6.419">although I suspect with Trump and the</text>
  <text start="378.889" dur="5.46">explosion of our economy how it&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="382.189" dur="5.57">so well and with infrastructure that</text>
  <text start="384.349" dur="6.72">they may govern Dunlevy may get a road</text>
  <text start="387.759" dur="7.15">built between Juneau and paints which</text>
  <text start="391.069" dur="6.831">may then lead to much</text>
  <text start="394.909" dur="5.841">hair before have enjoyed</text>
  <text start="397.9" dur="6.12">so this rainforest trail for me and my</text>
  <text start="400.75" dur="6.47">experience they went on that leads out</text>
  <text start="404.02" dur="3.2">to the Sabbath Island</text>
  <text start="408.33" dur="3.39">there&amp;#39;s another one</text>
  <text start="412.629" dur="7.651">stomp out of the trailer</text>
  <text start="415.75" dur="7.19">the long road how many world is from the</text>
  <text start="420.28" dur="2.66">bridge here</text>
  <text start="426.88" dur="2.54">Wow</text>

  <text start="482.21" dur="4.019">this is the extreme and there&amp;#39;s a trail</text>

  <text start="955.79" dur="6.6">after the flood</text>
  <text start="958.43" dur="5.31">okay so about 4000 years ago so this</text>
  <text start="962.39" dur="3.57">current</text>
  <text start="963.74" dur="5.67">leisure was probably formed just after</text>

  <text start="969.41" dur="3.84">now this this fear glacier is retreating</text>

  <text start="989.82" dur="4.129">oh yeah that would be after the flood</text>
  <text start="991.47" dur="2.479">yeah</text>
  <text start="1003.65" dur="3.3">talk a little bit about how the pyramids</text>
  <text start="1005.75" dur="3.209">were built</text>
  <text start="1006.95" dur="4.61">alright well we actually read about that</text>
  <text start="1008.959" dur="2.601">in the scriptures</text>
  <text start="1012.73" dur="4.99">the first the oldest one the Pyramid of</text>
  <text start="1014.8" dur="6.04">Giza is the oldest one</text>
  <text start="1017.72" dur="5.3">that was actually built by Enoch the</text>
  <text start="1020.84" dur="5.32">reason we know that is because in Isaiah</text>
  <text start="1023.02" dur="5.81">talks about how altar of yah was built</text>
  <text start="1026.16" dur="4.89">the land of Egypt the land of ham and</text>
  <text start="1028.83" dur="4.38">Enoch if you go into the Pyramid of Giza</text>
  <text start="1031.05" dur="6.17">you actually see the 6000 year plan of</text>
  <text start="1033.21" dur="6.599">the I turn it out on hallways</text>
  <text start="1037.22" dur="5.38">unfortunately</text>
  <text start="1039.809" dur="5.981">it&amp;#39;s beautiful altar - yah Farah Nicky&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1042.6" dur="5.5">it was taken over by the Black Cats</text>
  <text start="1045.79" dur="3.23">Satanic pedophiles pretty early on right</text>
  <text start="1048.1" dur="3.71">after the flood</text>
  <text start="1049.02" dur="5.37">by the descendants of ham</text>
  <text start="1051.81" dur="5.67">and of course Egypt which was a very</text>
  <text start="1054.39" dur="4.61">evil culture back then</text>
  <text start="1057.48" dur="3.56">they</text>
  <text start="1059" dur="4.32">enslaved the Israelites and had them</text>
  <text start="1061.04" dur="3.91">build sort of other pyramids after that</text>
  <text start="1063.32" dur="3.49">but</text>
  <text start="1064.95" dur="4.73">the Giza pyramid pretty much got taken</text>
  <text start="1066.81" dur="2.87">over by the Satanists</text>
  <text start="1070.15" dur="3.09">that&amp;#39;s how they were first formed and</text>
  <text start="1071.71" dur="6.03">then</text>
  <text start="1073.24" dur="8.22">I&amp;#39;m talking about how precise everything</text>
  <text start="1077.74" dur="7.05">fits and how they got those huge stones</text>
  <text start="1081.46" dur="5.31">up the side of the pyramid well you have</text>
  <text start="1084.79" dur="4.26">any opinion about that sir yeah people</text>
  <text start="1086.77" dur="4.26">remember it&amp;#39;s the second law of</text>
  <text start="1089.05" dur="2.94">thermodynamics and things go from a law</text>
  <text start="1091.03" dur="4.32">of order to disorder</text>
  <text start="1091.99" dur="4.97">so that means rather than evolution</text>
  <text start="1095.35" dur="3.89">we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="1096.96" dur="3.93">this means Adam and Eve</text>
  <text start="1099.24" dur="3.51">he&amp;#39;s 100% of their brains whereas we can</text>
  <text start="1100.89" dur="4.05">only use what 2% of our Rangers of their</text>
  <text start="1102.75" dur="4.58">parasite so they were much more powerful</text>
  <text start="1104.94" dur="5.849">stronger or intelligent and then as</text>
  <text start="1107.33" dur="6.79">history progressed sin has caused our</text>
  <text start="1110.789" dur="5.49">human species to break down so back then</text>
  <text start="1114.12" dur="4.53">they were much more smarter they could</text>
  <text start="1116.279" dur="4.591">do more with less</text>
  <text start="1118.65" dur="4.92">in fact they found us perfectly cuts</text>
  <text start="1120.87" dur="5.12">fear in one of the pyramids that today</text>
  <text start="1123.57" dur="4.589">we can only do using laser technology</text>
  <text start="1125.99" dur="5.799">there are much more smarter much more</text>
  <text start="1128.159" dur="5.791">capable and as our 6000 year history is</text>
  <text start="1131.789" dur="3.87">progressed the second law of</text>
  <text start="1133.95" dur="4.53">thermodynamics which kicked in when the</text>
  <text start="1135.659" dur="4.201">moment Adam and Eve sinned things were</text>
  <text start="1138.48" dur="3.42">gone from state-ordered disorder so we</text>
  <text start="1139.86" dur="5.67">have lost less of our brains less of our</text>
  <text start="1141.9" dur="5.25">bodies become not as powerful</text>
  <text start="1145.53" dur="3.3">so I&amp;#39;m able to do the things that our</text>
  <text start="1147.15" dur="5.66">ancestors were able to do we have more</text>
  <text start="1148.83" dur="7.98">information about certain thing hurt but</text>
  <text start="1152.81" dur="5.65">we don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m not the wisdom and</text>
  <text start="1156.81" dur="3.99">ability to apply that information as</text>
  <text start="1158.46" dur="6.03">well as our ancestors okay so you have</text>
  <text start="1160.8" dur="6.11">no idea how they did it look at a plane</text>
  <text start="1164.49" dur="2.42">up there</text>
  <text start="1166.95" dur="5.43">you have no idea how they got those</text>
  <text start="1169.35" dur="6.66">stoners the ski resort</text>
  <text start="1172.38" dur="6.75">we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna skip</text>
  <text start="1176.01" dur="6.36">how they got those stones into place and</text>
  <text start="1179.13" dur="4.89">how they did that right I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1182.37" dur="3.929">there&amp;#39;s theories about how they did it</text>
  <text start="1184.02" dur="5.25">but I think they had they had such</text>
  <text start="1186.299" dur="6.081">advanced understandings of how physics</text>
  <text start="1189.27" dur="3.11">and everything work that</text>
  <text start="1195.62" dur="5.52">you know in in Rome they had they had</text>
  <text start="1198.049" dur="6.87">coin-operated elevators in the ruins of</text>
  <text start="1201.14" dur="4.919">Babylon they found batteries like I said</text>
  <text start="1204.919" dur="4.471">they had a sphere they can all we could</text>
  <text start="1206.059" dur="6.291">only make a laser so they they</text>
  <text start="1209.39" dur="2.96">understood how to</text>
  <text start="1212.41" dur="3.76">do things that we just can&amp;#39;t do today</text>
  <text start="1214.18" dur="4.12">yes we have</text>
  <text start="1216.17" dur="6.06">you know machines and things to help us</text>
  <text start="1218.3" dur="9.09">well years ago I saw a documentary about</text>
  <text start="1222.23" dur="6.78">a guy who was very ill and he was to the</text>
  <text start="1227.39" dur="3.87">point where he couldn&amp;#39;t do anything he</text>
  <text start="1229.01" dur="5.42">could just take little walks though he</text>
  <text start="1231.26" dur="6.78">would walk around the countryside and</text>
  <text start="1234.43" dur="7.21">keep jabbing his is stick into the</text>
  <text start="1238.04" dur="5.82">ground looking for something and what it</text>
  <text start="1241.64" dur="5.06">was that he finally found it</text>
  <text start="1243.86" dur="8.73">he found bedrock so that the whole</text>
  <text start="1246.7" dur="10.54">countryside was full of bedrock and when</text>
  <text start="1252.59" dur="8.43">he got better he bought that land and he</text>
  <text start="1257.24" dur="7.44">continued he would extract a piece of</text>
  <text start="1261.02" dur="7.47">stone from it like three thousand five</text>
  <text start="1264.68" dur="7.35">thousand pound stone and build a piece</text>
  <text start="1268.49" dur="5.73">of furniture out of it and nobody ever</text>
  <text start="1272.03" dur="3.84">knew how he did it but he built</text>
  <text start="1274.22" dur="4.98">furniture after furniture after</text>
  <text start="1275.87" dur="6.24">furniture in fact he had a door that</text>
  <text start="1279.2" dur="5.47">with a you know just one key and push</text>
  <text start="1282.11" dur="4.449">could rotate</text>
  <text start="1284.67" dur="3.72">and it was so well-balanced that it</text>
  <text start="1286.559" dur="9.211">would just rotate you could go in and</text>
  <text start="1288.39" dur="9.6">rotate it closed and so some people were</text>
  <text start="1295.77" dur="6.539">bothering him and he had to move the</text>
  <text start="1297.99" dur="6.51">whole thing and he called a truck driver</text>
  <text start="1302.309" dur="4.921">he said you know come and don&amp;#39;t want you</text>
  <text start="1304.5" dur="6.21">to move my stuff for me and he told the</text>
  <text start="1307.23" dur="5.76">driver you go around that road back</text>
  <text start="1310.71" dur="4.89">there and wait till I call you</text>
  <text start="1312.99" dur="4.53">then they and the guy would go and he</text>
  <text start="1315.6" dur="5.34">would hear something clunk onto his</text>
  <text start="1317.52" dur="5.909">truck he came back and there&amp;#39;s this huge</text>
  <text start="1320.94" dur="5.19">stone over this truck never knew how I</text>
  <text start="1323.429" dur="4.951">get it he had never had any kind of a</text>
  <text start="1326.13" dur="5.58">power equipment or anything like that</text>
  <text start="1328.38" dur="6.179">so I figured and then this is a</text>
  <text start="1331.71" dur="5.69">documentary that I saw on television and</text>
  <text start="1334.559" dur="8.181">I figured that</text>
  <text start="1337.4" dur="8.61">he tapped into some sort of evil ability</text>
  <text start="1342.74" dur="4.47">that could move huge stones are huge</text>
  <text start="1346.01" dur="5.52">things</text>
  <text start="1347.21" dur="8.1">he moved his whole Park where he was</text>
  <text start="1351.53" dur="4.47">living that way and no one ever knew how</text>
  <text start="1355.31" dur="2.88">he did it</text>
  <text start="1356" dur="5.82">no one ever knew they could not figure</text>
  <text start="1358.19" dur="6.33">out how he did it so yeah there there is</text>
  <text start="1361.82" dur="4.17">another side too I didn&amp;#39;t cover this</text>
  <text start="1364.52" dur="4.77">message there respond to what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1365.99" dur="5.19">saying so there was both advanced human</text>
  <text start="1369.29" dur="4.41">intelligence that&amp;#39;s T greater - you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1371.18" dur="4.35">right there were fallen angels</text>
  <text start="1373.7" dur="4.17">in fact we read about this in Genesis 6</text>
  <text start="1375.53" dur="5.05">before the plunge fall angels came down</text>
  <text start="1377.87" dur="4.42">and made it with women</text>
  <text start="1380.58" dur="3.24">and gave birth to the giant sandwich</text>
  <text start="1382.29" dur="3.72">yeah yeah that&amp;#39;s whether he says whitey</text>
  <text start="1383.82" dur="3.78">awesome flood but these dainties also</text>
  <text start="1386.01" dur="3.4">brought technology whose fallen angels</text>
  <text start="1387.6" dur="3.31">brought technology and</text>
  <text start="1389.41" dur="3.96">and abilities supernatural abilities</text>
  <text start="1390.91" dur="4.98">paper and in fact to this day you have</text>
  <text start="1393.37" dur="5.76">witches back that book okay just set the</text>
  <text start="1395.89" dur="5.1">captive free friend sequel up to four by</text>
  <text start="1399.13" dur="3.9">Rebecca round are about how witches to</text>
  <text start="1400.99" dur="3.54">this day have these special abilities</text>
  <text start="1403.03" dur="5.73">through Saint Anne is it called angels</text>
  <text start="1404.53" dur="5.82">to do telepathy to do</text>
  <text start="1408.76" dur="3.51">would he call when you&amp;#39;re able to raise</text>
  <text start="1410.35" dur="4.2">things up like Luke Skywalker doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1412.27" dur="6.95">the force levitation levitation</text>
  <text start="1414.55" dur="4.67">that&amp;#39;s all satanic that&amp;#39;s all witchcraft</text>
  <text start="1419.3" dur="5.51">and so yeah yeah they are able to tap</text>
  <text start="1422.36" dur="2.45">into these</text>
  <text start="1425.25" dur="5.669">so I figured well that&amp;#39;s one way that</text>
  <text start="1428.88" dur="4.89">they could have built the pyramid</text>
  <text start="1430.919" dur="5.071">sure sure they were very much into that</text>
  <text start="1433.77" dur="4.23">kind of stuff and if this guy could</text>
  <text start="1435.99" dur="5.309">figure it out they could certainly</text>
  <text start="1438" dur="4.86">figure it out and so God cuz definitely</text>
  <text start="1441.299" dur="2.851">like with the perimeter Giza even though</text>
  <text start="1442.86" dur="4.049">I do think virtually built by a</text>
  <text start="1444.15" dur="5.13">righteous man Enoch was daunted by the</text>
  <text start="1446.909" dur="5.611">black Atman I think the other ones have</text>
  <text start="1449.28" dur="4.83">been built for Satanist but uh</text>
  <text start="1452.52" dur="3.99">that tournament accuse I believe is</text>
  <text start="1454.11" dur="4.02">going to come into play to bring part of</text>
  <text start="1456.51" dur="5.67">the great deluge of the offerings upon</text>
  <text start="1458.13" dur="6.69">overall great tribulation comes now this</text>
  <text start="1462.18" dur="6.27">is just my period not just say it yeah</text>
  <text start="1464.82" dur="5.49">but I believe that because they just two</text>
  <text start="1468.45" dur="3.62">years ago the French scientist upon</text>
  <text start="1470.31" dur="4.26">parted pyramid at giza with these</text>
  <text start="1472.07" dur="6.51">electrons and they found a hidden vault</text>
  <text start="1474.57" dur="7.14">in Iza bar over the top and they so far</text>
  <text start="1478.58" dur="4.93">authorities have not allowed scientists</text>
  <text start="1481.71" dur="3.93">to go in there but the scientists are</text>
  <text start="1483.51" dur="4.71">developing these nanobots little</text>
  <text start="1485.64" dur="5.52">miniature robots to go in and film it</text>
