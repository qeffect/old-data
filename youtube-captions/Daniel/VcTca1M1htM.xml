  <text start="11.19" dur="8.94">the Sabbath hallelujah we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="15.78" dur="6.989">talk about a very very sober topic today</text>
  <text start="20.13" dur="4.83">as I&amp;#39;m going on this beautiful journey</text>
  <text start="22.769" dur="6.121">here in the Pacific Northwest for Yom</text>
  <text start="24.96" dur="6.78">Kippur if you look at the book of</text>
  <text start="28.89" dur="7.14">Zechariah and you read in Zechariah</text>
  <text start="31.74" dur="6.659">chapter 5 Zechariah chapter 5 has a very</text>
  <text start="36.03" dur="4.11">interesting passage in it that has</text>
  <text start="38.399" dur="4.081">remained a mystery for a lot of people</text>
  <text start="40.14" dur="5.7">for a long time talks about this flying</text>
  <text start="42.48" dur="5.309">scroll talks about this Aoife or barrel</text>
  <text start="45.84" dur="4.14">talks about a woman going into this</text>
  <text start="47.789" dur="4.68">barrel is Aoife in it you know and then</text>
  <text start="49.98" dur="4.829">it talks about how two women come out</text>
  <text start="52.469" dur="5.121">and it&amp;#39;s great wickedness and all of</text>
  <text start="54.809" dur="4.98">these all of these curious examples that</text>
  <text start="57.59" dur="5.71">that are talked about in Zechariah</text>
  <text start="59.789" dur="5.58">chapter 5 well it is Yom Kippur it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="63.3" dur="4.2">very sober day a day that we afflict our</text>
  <text start="65.369" dur="4.471">souls you know we don&amp;#39;t eat we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="5.58">drink it&amp;#39;s a day of repentance and</text>
  <text start="69.84" dur="4.62">fasting and prayer a day of affliction</text>
  <text start="73.08" dur="4.2">and so I thought it was appropriate to</text>
  <text start="74.46" dur="4.5">reveal some very prophetic and important</text>
  <text start="77.28" dur="6.17">things about what&amp;#39;s about to occur</text>
  <text start="78.96" dur="9.479">between the years 2014 and the years</text>
  <text start="83.45" dur="7.989">2017 it&amp;#39;s basically going to be the time</text>
  <text start="88.439" dur="4.521">of the son of perdition the time of the</text>
  <text start="91.439" dur="7.851">wicked one the abomination of desolation</text>
  <text start="92.96" dur="6.33">that will occur on March 11 2014 and</text>
  <text start="100.31" dur="5.08">continue on for 42 months so I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="104.13" dur="4.879">going to read my scriptures here real</text>
  <text start="105.39" dur="8.07">quickly and I&amp;#39;m going to open up to</text>
  <text start="109.009" dur="5.831">Zechariah chapter 5 just because thakur</text>
  <text start="113.46" dur="7.769">I&amp;#39;d does a much better job at</text>
  <text start="114.84" dur="8.639">articulating this than I would and in</text>
  <text start="121.229" dur="5.46">Zechariah 5 we said this is the vision</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="4.89">that he has then I turned and I lifted</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="4.501">up mine eyes and looked and behold a</text>
  <text start="128.369" dur="5.401">flying scroll and he said unto me what</text>
  <text start="131.19" dur="4.98">seest thou and I said I see a flying</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="5.01">scroll the length thereof is twenty</text>
  <text start="136.17" dur="4.83">cubits and the breadth thereof is ten</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="4.92">cubits then he said unto me this is the</text>
  <text start="141" dur="5.31">curse that goes forth over the face of</text>
  <text start="143.7" dur="4.5">the whole earth for everyone that steals</text>
  <text start="146.31" dur="4.38">shall be cut off as on this side</text>
  <text start="148.2" dur="4.98">according to it and everyone that swears</text>
  <text start="150.69" dur="4.77">falsely shall be cut off on that side</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="4.74">according to it I will bring it forth</text>
  <text start="155.46" dur="4.92">says Yahweh savvy oat and it shall enter</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="5.07">into the house of the thief and into the</text>
  <text start="160.38" dur="5.43">house of him that swears falsely by my</text>
  <text start="162.99" dur="5.19">name talking about hypocrites right</text>
  <text start="165.81" dur="3.99">there and it shall remain in the midst</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="2.94">of his house and shall consume it with</text>
  <text start="169.8" dur="3.72">the timber thereof and the stones</text>
  <text start="171.12" dur="4.47">thereof then the angel that talked with</text>
  <text start="173.52" dur="4.38">me went forth and said unto me lift up</text>
  <text start="175.59" dur="5.28">now your eyes and see what is this that</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="5.67">goes forth and I said what is it and he</text>
  <text start="180.87" dur="5.85">said this is an ephah or a large basket</text>
  <text start="183.57" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s a measuring basket that goes forth</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="4.26">he said moreover this is their</text>
  <text start="188.67" dur="4.11">resemblance through all the earth and</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="5.01">behold there was lifted up a talent of</text>
  <text start="192.78" dur="5.37">lead and this is a woman that sits in</text>
  <text start="195.99" dur="5.16">the midst of the barrel of the ephah and</text>
  <text start="198.15" dur="4.62">he said this is wickedness and he cast</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="3.18">it into the midst of the ephah and he</text>
  <text start="202.77" dur="4.439">cast the weight of lead upon the mouth</text>
  <text start="204.33" dur="4.53">of the barrel of the ephah then lifted</text>
  <text start="207.209" dur="4.531">up mine eyes and looked and behold there</text>
  <text start="208.86" dur="4.41">came out to women and the wind was in</text>
  <text start="211.74" dur="3.51">their wings where they had wings like</text>
  <text start="213.27" dur="3.84">the wings of a stork and I lifted up the</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="4.08">ephah the barrel between the earth and</text>
  <text start="217.11" dur="3.48">the heaven then said I did the angel</text>
  <text start="219.33" dur="4.08">that talked with me whither do these</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="5.55">bear this Aoife and he said to me to</text>
  <text start="223.41" dur="5.67">build it a house in the land of Shinar</text>
  <text start="226.14" dur="7.92">Babylon and it shall be established and</text>
  <text start="229.08" dur="7.11">set their upon her own base I&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="234.06" dur="5.55">about how there&amp;#39;s going to be a time</text>
  <text start="236.19" dur="6.24">coming up next spring where Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="239.61" dur="4.83">going to send out his chariots of fire</text>
  <text start="242.43" dur="3.42">he&amp;#39;s going to gather his true people to</text>
  <text start="244.44" dur="4.17">the safe place it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="245.85" dur="4.05">somewhere east of Jerusalem I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="248.61" dur="3.24">where the location is but he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="249.9" dur="4.38">supernaturally just like he did with</text>
