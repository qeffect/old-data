  <text start="4.98" dur="7.5">website is wwwspa- aam and today is my</text>
  <text start="10.139" dur="5.281">weekly midweek podcast and reporting</text>
  <text start="12.48" dur="5.49">from beautiful downtown Portland Oregon</text>
  <text start="15.42" dur="5.82">and today I want to issue a challenge to</text>
  <text start="17.97" dur="5.549">Michael John rude messianic teacher for</text>
  <text start="21.24" dur="4.289">the last several weeks if not months he</text>
  <text start="23.519" dur="3.541">has been saying on his emails that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="25.529" dur="3.781">been sending out to his email list and</text>
  <text start="27.06" dur="5.19">he&amp;#39;s been posting on his live streaming</text>
  <text start="29.31" dur="4.769">webcasts on Shabbat about how evil and</text>
  <text start="32.25" dur="5.7">wicked the pre-tribulation rapture is</text>
  <text start="34.079" dur="6.061">what a bad option it is and just how</text>
  <text start="37.95" dur="4.53">evil these pre-tribulation rapture asar</text>
  <text start="40.14" dur="3.48">in what they&amp;#39;re believing that we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="42.48" dur="4.5">going to get whisked out of here before</text>
  <text start="43.62" dur="5.25">the tribulation begins now I do not</text>
  <text start="46.98" dur="3.899">agree of course with the pre-tribulation</text>
  <text start="48.87" dur="4.56">rapture I think that Michael routes</text>
  <text start="50.879" dur="4.891">correct this doctrine is evil it&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="53.43" dur="3.75">it has no place in Scripture and anyone</text>
  <text start="55.77" dur="4.879">who follows it is setting themselves up</text>
  <text start="57.18" dur="6">for for a pretty disappointing future</text>
  <text start="60.649" dur="4.48">however I want to call Michael root out</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="5.49">on the carpet and I want to challenge</text>
  <text start="65.129" dur="6.211">him because he is perpetuating a far</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="4.23">more subtle and insidious deception upon</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="3.99">thousands of people who call themselves</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="3.719">messy annex or people who are trying to</text>
  <text start="75.33" dur="3.57">get back to the Hebrew roots of the</text>
  <text start="76.619" dur="5.131">Christian faith and the deception that</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="4.5">he&amp;#39;s putting upon people is he while he</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="4.43">tries to tell people that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="83.4" dur="6.21">following traditions of men and</text>
  <text start="86.18" dur="7.18">doctrines of men he himself is following</text>
  <text start="89.61" dur="5.549">doctrines of men he has been for several</text>
  <text start="93.36" dur="4.23">years close friends with a pretty</text>
  <text start="95.159" dur="5.25">prominent karaite Jew from Israel known</text>
  <text start="97.59" dur="4.62">as nehemia Gordon and Nehemia Gordon</text>
  <text start="100.409" dur="5.611">believes that the beginning of the new</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="7.5">year the Jewish here starts when the</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="5.629">Aviv is barley when the barley excuse me</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="6.479">when the barley is a V or ripe</text>
  <text start="111.649" dur="8.271">throughout Israel and that is just</text>
  <text start="116.189" dur="6.351">ludicrous it&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="119.92" dur="5.29">because my crew believes in this last</text>
  <text start="122.54" dur="6.03">year 2010 he celebrated the feast days</text>
  <text start="125.21" dur="6.33">an entire month too early putting the</text>

  <text start="144.74" dur="5.91">thousands of his followers to keep the</text>
  <text start="146.33" dur="6.63">feasts too early I want to issue my crew</text>

  <text start="165.89" dur="4.2">like to debate publicly but i&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="167.69" dur="4.58">debate you on the calendar issue because</text>
  <text start="170.09" dur="8.16">according to Leviticus chapter 23 verse</text>
  <text start="172.27" dur="8.2">10 it is very very very clear that all</text>
  <text start="178.25" dur="4.62">of the children of Israel are commanded</text>
  <text start="180.47" dur="4.47">just as they&amp;#39;re commanded throughout the</text>
  <text start="182.87" dur="3.6">23rd chapter to keep all the feast all</text>
  <text start="184.94" dur="2.88">the children of israel commanded to</text>
  <text start="186.47" dur="3.15">bring up the first fruits of their</text>
  <text start="187.82" dur="5.46">barley harvest to the high priests in</text>
  <text start="189.62" dur="6.21">Jerusalem the only way the only way that</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="4.56">all the barley will be Aviv throughout</text>
  <text start="195.83" dur="3.48">the entire land of Israel so that all</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="3.27">the tribes would have been able to bring</text>
  <text start="199.31" dur="3.72">up there right barley to the high</text>
  <text start="201.11" dur="4.44">priests in Jerusalem would be to wait</text>
  <text start="203.03" dur="5.489">for the first new moon after the spring</text>
  <text start="205.55" dur="5.76">equinox that&amp;#39;s the only time all the</text>
  <text start="208.519" dur="4.621">barley at Israel will be right the fact</text>
  <text start="211.31" dur="4.74">is when the Hemi had Gordon declared the</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="4.86">new year he was looking at a few just</text>
  <text start="216.05" dur="3.93">barely right shocks of barley just</text>
  <text start="218" dur="4.019">outside of Jerusalem and yet in the</text>
  <text start="219.98" dur="4.02">guinea hen turret and in northern Israel</text>
  <text start="222.019" dur="3.841">there were whole tracts of land where</text>
  <text start="224" dur="4.5">barley was still not even close to being</text>
  <text start="225.86" dur="4.71">right those tribes who lived in that</text>
  <text start="228.5" dur="4.35">part of Israel would not have been</text>
  <text start="230.57" dur="4.62">prepared to keep the feast of Passover</text>
  <text start="232.85" dur="3.9">in which they were required to bring the</text>
  <text start="235.19" dur="3.78">shocks of barley up to the high priest</text>
  <text start="236.75" dur="5.38">it wouldn&amp;#39;t have happened not only does</text>
  <text start="238.97" dur="5.5">it take some time to remove</text>
  <text start="242.13" dur="4.71">or to harvest of the barley but then it</text>
  <text start="244.47" dur="4.65">takes time for the various tribes of</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="5.07">Israel to journey up to three days to</text>
  <text start="249.12" dur="6.54">get to Jerusalem from across the land of</text>
  <text start="251.91" dur="6.09">Israel the fact is nehemia Gordon and</text>
  <text start="255.66" dur="4.32">the Karaites believe that you only have</text>
  <text start="258" dur="6.09">to find a few ripe shocks that barley</text>
  <text start="259.98" dur="6.03">right right near Jerusalem and as long</text>
  <text start="264.09" dur="4.61">as that&amp;#39;s done then everything&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="266.01" dur="6.66">but that is in direct contradiction in</text>
  <text start="268.7" dur="6.7">violation of Leviticus 23 10 I challenge</text>
  <text start="272.67" dur="5.01">you go read it Leviticus 23 10 is clear</text>
  <text start="275.4" dur="4.32">that all the children of Israel have to</text>
  <text start="277.68" dur="3.6">bring up their ripen shocks of barley to</text>
  <text start="279.72" dur="3.24">the high priests to be waved as the</text>
  <text start="281.28" dur="4.44">firstfruits offering for the Peace of</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="6.99">firstfruits during the feast week of</text>
  <text start="285.72" dur="7.74">Passover Hemi a Gordon follows correct</text>
  <text start="289.95" dur="5.55">tradition that is frankly in violation</text>
  <text start="293.46" dur="3.99">of the Torah he follows this tradition</text>
  <text start="295.5" dur="4.35">because he lacks the ruach ha kodesh the</text>
  <text start="297.45" dur="5.28">holy spirit he doesn&amp;#39;t understand what</text>
  <text start="299.85" dur="4.71">firstfruits even means Apostle Paul the</text>
  <text start="302.73" dur="3.15">rabbi shai wool he talked about the</text>
  <text start="304.56" dur="3.84">application of firstfruits he talked</text>
  <text start="305.88" dur="4.26">about how Yahshua who is our King and</text>
  <text start="308.4" dur="4.02">priest is the firstfruits among the dead</text>
  <text start="310.14" dur="4.29">but nehemia Gordon doesn&amp;#39;t even believe</text>
  <text start="312.42" dur="4.71">that Yahshua the Messiah he doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="314.43" dur="4.02">acknowledge the Messiah sure he&amp;#39;ll give</text>
  <text start="317.13" dur="3.87">lip service so that he can get money</text>
  <text start="318.45" dur="3.81">from Christians but other than that he</text>
  <text start="321" dur="3.72">doesn&amp;#39;t believe in the Messiah and he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="322.26" dur="5.04">admit to that it&amp;#39;s time to stop</text>
  <text start="324.72" dur="5.46">following the folly of these carrots and</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="4.98">their stupid traditions that plainly and</text>
  <text start="330.18" dur="4.32">completely contradict Leviticus 23 10</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="4.38">the only way that nehemia Gordon could</text>
  <text start="334.5" dur="4.59">be right is if you read Leviticus 23 10</text>
  <text start="336.66" dur="5.16">and determine that only the high priest</text>
  <text start="339.09" dur="4.35">has to go out beyond the borders of</text>
  <text start="341.82" dur="4.68">Jerusalem and find a few shocks of</text>
  <text start="343.44" dur="5.37">barley to wave in the temple and yet</text>
  <text start="346.5" dur="4.26">that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense because if</text>
  <text start="348.81" dur="4.47">you read the context of Leviticus 23</text>
  <text start="350.76" dur="5.04">which details the feast days that</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="4.86">chapter is clearly written to all the</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="3.99">children of Israel after all is it only</text>
  <text start="358.14" dur="3.57">the high priests who has to keep Sabbath</text>
  <text start="359.79" dur="3.71">is it only the high priests who has to</text>
  <text start="361.71" dur="6.33">keep Passover and unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="6.43">Chuvalo Sukkot course not the Vegas 23</text>
  <text start="368.04" dur="3.81">is written to all the children of Israel</text>
  <text start="369.93" dur="3.06">so why would verse 10 be any different</text>
  <text start="371.85" dur="3.72">the</text>
  <text start="372.99" dur="4.62">the matter is the interpretation Nehemia</text>
  <text start="375.57" dur="4.44">Gordon doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense and it</text>
  <text start="377.61" dur="5.1">caused thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="380.01" dur="5.04">Messianic last year to keep the feasts</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="4.23">on a month entirely too early now I</text>
  <text start="385.05" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t blame the Hammond Gordon after all</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="3.27">he&amp;#39;s not fill with the Holy Spirit it</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="3.09">isn&amp;#39;t claimed to be a lover of Yahshua</text>
  <text start="390.21" dur="4.65">so of course he&amp;#39;s going to be deceived</text>
  <text start="391.71" dur="5.16">but I do blame you Michael Rood I blame</text>
  <text start="394.86" dur="3.54">you because you should know better you</text>
  <text start="396.87" dur="3.45">claim to be filled with the Ruach you</text>
