  <text start="139.99" dur="4.71">experiencing that this week I have such</text>
  <text start="143.14" dur="4.38">a victory to talk about from last</text>
  <text start="144.7" dur="5.34">chapeau out now every year it seems like</text>
  <text start="147.52" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to get anyone to</text>
  <text start="150.04" dur="3.06">want to celebrate chef wote and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="151.69" dur="2.7">know why I don&amp;#39;t know why I Pentecost</text>
  <text start="153.1" dur="2.9">seems to be the one piece where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.39" dur="4.05">hard to get people to gather together I</text>
  <text start="156" dur="4.99">remember a year ago I literally spent</text>
  <text start="158.44" dur="5.46">pedda cost alone it was just me at a</text>
  <text start="160.99" dur="4.62">park reading from Scripture that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.9" dur="4.29">definitely not how yah wants his feast</text>
  <text start="165.61" dur="5.19">to be in fact Pentecost chef woo is one</text>
  <text start="168.19" dur="4.56">of the three major ones there&amp;#39;s Passover</text>
  <text start="170.8" dur="4.23">that kicks off the year there&amp;#39;s a boat</text>
  <text start="172.75" dur="4.98">that is at the end of the spring early</text>
  <text start="175.03" dur="5.1">summer and then there is a Sukkot in the</text>
  <text start="177.73" dur="5.04">fall so shadow it&amp;#39;s one of the big three</text>
  <text start="180.13" dur="5.55">and just could never get anyone to come</text>
  <text start="182.77" dur="5.64">together but this last shallotte that</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="4.53">happened on sunday the june twelfth</text>
  <text start="188.41" dur="4.17">actually started on saturday night went</text>

  <text start="209.95" dur="3.45">food and fellowship and sharing of</text>
  <text start="211.54" dur="5.49">testimonies and it was actually a really</text>
  <text start="213.4" dur="8.55">really blessed time and as I was driving</text>
  <text start="217.03" dur="5.88">away that that early evening after we</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="3.33">pretty much spent the whole afternoon</text>
  <text start="222.91" dur="4.98">there from noon until early evening I</text>
  <text start="225.28" dur="4.679">just there was just a song in my heart</text>
  <text start="227.89" dur="5.25">and I was shouting on my window victory</text>
  <text start="229.959" dur="6.301">victory because I finally got to</text>
  <text start="233.14" dur="5.04">experience a Pentecostal where we</text>
  <text start="236.26" dur="4.32">gathered together and I really can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="238.18" dur="4.62">remember doing so on that day since oh</text>
  <text start="240.58" dur="5.46">man they have to go all the way back to</text>
  <text start="242.8" dur="5.7">two thousand one and that was like sort</text>
  <text start="246.04" dur="3.84">of a BBQ type deal and I remember it was</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="3">the first time I&amp;#39;d ever kept the feasts</text>
  <text start="249.88" dur="3.24">and the first time for many people that</text>
  <text start="251.5" dur="5.1">I was with we were meeting up at a house</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="5.79">up in Washington State and we have this</text>
  <text start="256.6" dur="4.539">book open one of the guys had this book</text>
  <text start="258.91" dur="4.45">open trying to figure out like</text>
  <text start="261.139" dur="4.891">what do we do on this day how do we do</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="5.459">on this nice day anyway it was a it was</text>
  <text start="266.03" dur="5.4">a really really fun time and was very</text>
  <text start="268.819" dur="6.72">edified and very refreshed and</text>
  <text start="271.43" dur="5.549">rejuvenated the week before at work it</text>
  <text start="275.539" dur="3.12">was a real struggle I&amp;#39;d only gotten two</text>
  <text start="276.979" dur="4.081">appointments which was like my lowest</text>
  <text start="278.659" dur="4.951">week ever but after having both a</text>
  <text start="281.06" dur="4.59">shabbat and then having pentecost chef</text>
  <text start="283.61" dur="3.45">wote so it was like a Sabbath day than a</text>
  <text start="285.65" dur="4.62">high Sabbath day a double Sabbath</text>
  <text start="287.06" dur="4.919">weekend I felt so refreshed and so built</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="3.919">up and so then this week I was able to</text>
  <text start="291.979" dur="4.5">get eight appointments and my boss</text>
  <text start="294.189" dur="4.72">during my accountability session he was</text>
  <text start="296.479" dur="4.44">like so what what changed and I looked</text>
  <text start="298.909" dur="3.78">at him and I said well I had a double</text>
  <text start="300.919" dur="3.27">Sabbath weekend I got to enjoy not only</text>
  <text start="302.689" dur="4.29">the weekly Shabbat but I got to enjoy</text>
  <text start="304.189" dur="5.22">Pentecost too he&amp;#39;s not religious at all</text>
  <text start="306.979" dur="7.891">so he sort of looked at me like what so</text>
  <text start="309.409" dur="7.38">it was a good way to testify and then of</text>
  <text start="314.87" dur="4.379">course Jerry and I we preached last</text>
  <text start="316.789" dur="7.081">shabbat we preach tag and down at the</text>
  <text start="319.249" dur="6.03">waterfront and right toward the end of</text>
  <text start="323.87" dur="2.789">our preaching we spent I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="325.279" dur="4.471">many hours down there I know we both</text>
  <text start="326.659" dur="4.53">were completely wiped out after we were</text>
  <text start="329.75" dur="5.4">done preaching but toward the end there</text>
  <text start="331.189" dur="5.4">was a guy who had this guitar and I said</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="3.539">why don&amp;#39;t you start just playing your</text>
  <text start="336.589" dur="3.75">guitar at whatever whatever to new play</text>
  <text start="338.689" dur="4.2">i will start singing out the scripture</text>
  <text start="340.339" dur="6.241">and so I started singing out psalm i</text>
  <text start="342.889" dur="7.2">think it was psalm 119 as this guy</text>
  <text start="346.58" dur="7.709">played the guitar and hallelujah it was</text>
  <text start="350.089" dur="5.521">it was really cool do do do do the 11th</text>
  <text start="354.289" dur="3.69">Shabbat can&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s already the</text>
  <text start="355.61" dur="5.85">11th Shabbat since since the new year</text>
  <text start="357.979" dur="4.65">began that&amp;#39;s really hard to believe one</text>
  <text start="361.46" dur="3.269">of the things that I talked about with</text>
  <text start="362.629" dur="7.111">some of the ladies that gathered at</text>
  <text start="364.729" dur="6.72">shavuot was intercessory prayer right</text>
  <text start="369.74" dur="3.389">before the service at khm they used to</text>
  <text start="371.449" dur="5.131">have this intercessory prayer time and</text>
  <text start="373.129" dur="5.731">it kind of kind of faded out and so then</text>
  <text start="376.58" dur="3.929">I called Jerry and talk to him and so</text>
  <text start="378.86" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re going to actually get to KH I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="380.509" dur="3.541">about 30 minutes early this morning and</text>
  <text start="382.58" dur="3.569">we&amp;#39;re going to restart this intercessory</text>
  <text start="384.05" dur="4.019">prayer because it&amp;#39;s always important</text>
  <text start="386.149" dur="3.781">always important whether you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="388.069" dur="3.45">out preaching whether you&amp;#39;re meeting at</text>
  <text start="389.93" dur="3.359">a gathering to always have prayer</text>
  <text start="391.519" dur="2.01">intercessory prayer before hand I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="393.289" dur="2.13">just</text>
  <text start="393.529" dur="3.9">about a token prayer where you just I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="395.419" dur="5.93">talking about intercessory prayer like</text>
  <text start="397.429" dur="7.98">pressing into the throne room of yah</text>
  <text start="401.349" dur="6.04">that&amp;#39;s absolutely needed whenever you</text>
  <text start="405.409" dur="3.45">want yah to act whenever you want yah to</text>
  <text start="407.389" dur="3.29">move if you study revivals throughout</text>
  <text start="408.859" dur="4.89">history it was always bathed in</text>
  <text start="410.679" dur="8.89">intercessory prayer and coming before</text>

  <text start="426.079" dur="6.9">refreshing and not only the walks but</text>
  <text start="429.879" dur="5.11">sitting down in the midst of my walk and</text>

  <text start="455.959" dur="2.82">prophecy stuff to be sort of toward the</text>
  <text start="457.459" dur="3">bottom because that&amp;#39;s the meat of the</text>
  <text start="458.779" dur="3.27">word and like what I gave last night was</text>
  <text start="460.459" dur="3.3">sort of the meat of the word for people</text>
  <text start="462.049" dur="3.54">who are believers and were pressing into</text>
  <text start="463.759" dur="5.13">him and then have all the gospel</text>

  <text start="468.889" dur="3.12">about the commandments about his blood</text>
  <text start="470.299" dur="4.561">atonement to be at the top because</text>
  <text start="472.009" dur="5.101">that&amp;#39;s what goes forth to those who need</text>
  <text start="474.86" dur="5.489">Joshua those need to repent whether</text>
  <text start="477.11" dur="4.919">they&amp;#39;re religious or not but yesterday</text>
  <text start="480.349" dur="3.69">after I made that video and I was just</text>
  <text start="482.029" dur="5.19">kind of going into scripture I had</text>

  <text start="508.379" dur="5.34">things to do rejoice evermore and I</text>
  <text start="511.169" dur="3.961">could have sworn it was in Ephesians I</text>

  <text start="563.7" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a really important one we</text>
  <text start="565.32" dur="4.68">need to make sure what our conversation</text>
  <text start="568.23" dur="3.33">is both what we speak and as the King</text>

  <text start="600.33" dur="5.37">about shabbat you know I&amp;#39;ve had so many</text>
  <text start="604.14" dur="3.48">times where I&amp;#39;ve dealt with different</text>
