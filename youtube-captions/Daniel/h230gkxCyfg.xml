  <text start="34.219" dur="7.451">hallelujah and so I just I wanted to</text>
  <text start="37.71" dur="6.18">talk about a movie I saw I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="41.67" dur="4.38">actually been to the movie theater in</text>
  <text start="43.89" dur="3.48">months in months and months and months</text>
  <text start="46.05" dur="4.59">in fact I haven&amp;#39;t been to a movie</text>
  <text start="47.37" dur="5.189">theater since early last year because</text>
  <text start="50.64" dur="5.46">once I started exposing a lot of the</text>
  <text start="52.559" dur="4.68">satanic pedophiles in Hollywood number</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="4.139">one I lost interest</text>
  <text start="57.239" dur="5.82">in a lot of these movies and number two</text>
  <text start="60.239" dur="4.53">when I would look at the local movies</text>
  <text start="63.059" dur="3.121">playing at the movie theater I couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="64.769" dur="4.471">see a lot of them because either I</text>
  <text start="66.18" dur="5.04">wasn&amp;#39;t interested in them or if there</text>
  <text start="69.24" dur="4.11">were a movie that might normally be</text>
  <text start="71.22" dur="4.77">interesting going seeing I saw that they</text>
  <text start="73.35" dur="6.15">were either directed or starring people</text>
  <text start="75.99" dur="5.61">that are satanic pedophiles so I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="79.5" dur="3.99">even really wanted to do anything like</text>
  <text start="81.6" dur="4.08">that but a couple of nights ago after</text>
  <text start="83.49" dur="4.1">the prayer meeting I did go to the movie</text>
  <text start="85.68" dur="5.49">theater and I went to go see the movie</text>
  <text start="87.59" dur="5.68">unplanned now I don&amp;#39;t want to I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="91.17" dur="4.379">want to give away the all the plot</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="3.9">points and everything for those who may</text>
  <text start="95.549" dur="3.871">be interested and going to see it and</text>
  <text start="97.17" dur="5.339">you haven&amp;#39;t seen it yet but I went to go</text>
  <text start="99.42" dur="6.87">see it and I am so so glad that I did it</text>
  <text start="102.509" dur="7.741">was a incredibly incredibly powerful</text>
  <text start="106.29" dur="6.539">movie there is one scene right toward</text>
  <text start="110.25" dur="4.92">the beginning of the movie it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="112.829" dur="5.25">graphic actually but it it literally</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="6.449">shows a scene where they&amp;#39;re performing</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="5.58">an abortion on this young woman and the</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="6.121">main character looks up at the monitor</text>
  <text start="123.659" dur="6.66">at the screen and and sees this tiny</text>
  <text start="127.74" dur="4.47">little baby and it&amp;#39;s literally squirming</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="5.011">and fighting for its life</text>
  <text start="132.21" dur="7.32">the doctor is inserting this this tool</text>
  <text start="135.33" dur="11.15">into the womb and it is I have to say it</text>
  <text start="139.53" dur="10.47">is the most horrific haunting horrifying</text>
  <text start="146.48" dur="4.21">heartbreaking thing I&amp;#39;ve ever seen in my</text>
  <text start="150" dur="4.8">entire life</text>
  <text start="150.69" dur="6.21">it just it shatters your heart</text>
  <text start="154.8" dur="3.99">in fact it like I mean I don&amp;#39;t normally</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="3.84">cry at a movie but it literally just</text>
  <text start="158.79" dur="4.23">brought tears to my eyes and this is</text>
  <text start="160.74" dur="4.38">right at the very beginning of the movie</text>
  <text start="163.02" dur="6">before you&amp;#39;re even really invested in</text>
  <text start="165.12" dur="6.21">any of the characters so this this movie</text>
  <text start="169.02" dur="6.75">unplanned it is extremely extremely</text>
  <text start="171.33" dur="7.44">powerful and after after I finished</text>
  <text start="175.77" dur="7.61">seeing the movie I thought in I think</text>
  <text start="178.77" dur="7.26">Yas using this movie to to change</text>
  <text start="183.38" dur="6.88">people&amp;#39;s hearts and minds to change the</text>
  <text start="186.03" dur="6.74">culture it has - there&amp;#39;s no way you can</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="6.48">go and watch that movie and come out</text>
  <text start="192.77" dur="7.14">still being pro-choice still thinking</text>
  <text start="196.74" dur="6.15">that it&amp;#39;s okay to abort a baby</text>
  <text start="199.91" dur="5.68">there&amp;#39;s just unless unless your heart&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="202.89" dur="4.29">just completely completely black and</text>
  <text start="205.59" dur="3.99">stone and there&amp;#39;s just no hope for you</text>
  <text start="207.18" dur="5.94">but but I really think that y&amp;#39;all&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.58" dur="6.72">probably using this movie to change the</text>
  <text start="213.12" dur="5.16">hearts and minds of people all across</text>
  <text start="216.3" dur="5.22">this nation and just like we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="218.28" dur="5.88">with so many of these horrible and</text>
  <text start="221.52" dur="4.65">fantasise laws being pushed in various</text>
  <text start="224.16" dur="5.67">states and that&amp;#39;s kind of caused this</text>
  <text start="226.17" dur="5.7">reaction where we&amp;#39;re seeing a chain</text>
  <text start="229.83" dur="3.93">reaction really a domino effect of state</text>
  <text start="231.87" dur="4.86">after state promoting these very</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="5.22">pro-life heartbeat Mills that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="236.73" dur="7.02">reported quite a bit on I think in the</text>
  <text start="238.98" dur="8.61">same way Yahweh is using this movie</text>
  <text start="243.75" dur="7.29">unplanned to change people&amp;#39;s hearts and</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="6.53">minds and and and bring an end to this</text>
  <text start="251.04" dur="5.34">horrible horrible abortion industry</text>
  <text start="254.12" dur="2.67">murder industry that really is what it</text>
  <text start="256.38" dur="3.45">is</text>
  <text start="256.79" dur="5.89">so I just I wanted to just take a time</text>
  <text start="259.83" dur="5.28">to make a little video about this like I</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="4.739">said today is a Sabbath for me</text>
