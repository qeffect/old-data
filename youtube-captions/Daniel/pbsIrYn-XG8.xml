  <text start="18.96" dur="6.659">Sun set on April 7 2016 Thursday night</text>
  <text start="22.89" dur="4.799">the hebrew new year began the beginning</text>
  <text start="25.619" dur="5.4">of months as prescribed in Exodus</text>
  <text start="27.689" dur="4.59">because this is the first new moon the</text>
  <text start="31.019" dur="2.941">new moon actually the new moon</text>
  <text start="32.279" dur="3.12">conjunction actually occurred earlier in</text>
  <text start="33.96" dur="3.54">the day on April seventh and so of</text>
  <text start="35.399" dur="4.831">course you can&amp;#39;t be in a day until the</text>
  <text start="37.5" dur="4.8">Sun sets so as the sunset tonight after</text>
  <text start="40.23" dur="4.5">that moment of conjunction we are on the</text>
  <text start="42.3" dur="4.59">day of the new moon and not just any new</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="5.88">moon but the beginning of the months has</text>
  <text start="46.89" dur="5.669">talked about in Exodus I have quite a</text>
  <text start="50.61" dur="3.21">few extensive articles on the web site</text>
  <text start="52.559" dur="3.631">i&amp;#39;ll put a link on the bottom of this</text>
  <text start="53.82" dur="4.379">video that show how to calculate the new</text>
  <text start="56.19" dur="5.759">year according to Scripture you got to</text>
  <text start="58.199" dur="6.54">use genesis 1 14 and Leviticus 23 10 but</text>
  <text start="61.949" dur="4.831">suffice to say tonight this year and it</text>
  <text start="64.739" dur="5.341">happens on a different day every year</text>
  <text start="66.78" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s usually sometime in March April in</text>
  <text start="70.08" dur="4.59">fact it&amp;#39;s always in march april one of</text>
  <text start="72.03" dur="5.04">those two months but this year on the</text>
  <text start="74.67" dur="4.8">night of april seventh we have the new</text>
  <text start="77.07" dur="4.89">year and it goes from tonight thursday</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="6.21">night april seven until tomorrow night</text>
  <text start="81.96" dur="6.36">april eighth as the seventh day shabbat</text>
  <text start="85.68" dur="5.759">weekly Shabbat begins now this is not</text>
  <text start="88.32" dur="5.28">only the first day of the first month of</text>
  <text start="91.439" dur="4.29">a new year it&amp;#39;s not only new year&amp;#39;s day</text>
  <text start="93.6" dur="6.51">according to scriptures but it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="6.451">special new year because if you go to</text>
  <text start="100.11" dur="5.78">the Torah you&amp;#39;ll find that the scripture</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="7.86">yah through the scriptures of the Torah</text>
  <text start="105.89" dur="6.339">demarcates time by fifty year cycles and</text>
  <text start="110.04" dur="5.07">every 50th year you have a jubilee the</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="5.521">last Jubilee was actually in 1967 it was</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="4.53">from the spring of 67 because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="3.329">when the new year begins coordinate</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="3.72">scriptures in the spring and the month</text>
  <text start="121.079" dur="3.991">of Aviv it was in the spring of 67 to</text>
  <text start="123.36" dur="3.149">the spring of 68 and of course we know</text>
  <text start="125.07" dur="3.359">that that year was very special as a</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="5.191">jubilee because that was the year after</text>
  <text start="128.429" dur="4.241">almost 1,900 years the Jews recaptured</text>
  <text start="131.7" dur="4.58">Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="132.67" dur="6.159">well this year we are coming to what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.28" dur="5.31">known as a shemitah year now let me just</text>
  <text start="138.829" dur="6.601">take time to explain this you have a</text>
  <text start="141.59" dur="7.17">period of 49 years or seven years x 7</text>
  <text start="145.43" dur="7.229">and you have a time cycle of seven</text>
  <text start="148.76" dur="6.27">shemitah so that equals 49 years every</text>
  <text start="152.659" dur="4.771">seventh year in that 49 years eichel is</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="5.25">a shim it a year so just to make this</text>
  <text start="157.43" dur="6">very practical the last Jubilee was from</text>
  <text start="160.28" dur="5.64">spring of 67 268 and then when the</text>
  <text start="163.43" dur="4.979">spring of 68 came you now started the</text>
  <text start="165.92" dur="5.129">first year of a brand-new 50 year cycle</text>
  <text start="168.409" dur="5.311">so the spring of 68 to the spring of 69</text>
  <text start="171.049" dur="4.8">was your number one spring of 69 the</text>
  <text start="173.72" dur="3.359">spring of 70 was your number two so</text>
  <text start="175.849" dur="3.03">forth and so forth until you came to</text>
  <text start="177.079" dur="3.451">your number seven which would have been</text>
  <text start="178.879" dur="3.75">the first Schmidt a year in that cycle</text>
  <text start="180.53" dur="3.629">and then it starts again your number one</text>
  <text start="182.629" dur="4.291">you&amp;#39;re number two number three and you</text>
  <text start="184.159" dur="5.25">do it seven times well this year the</text>
  <text start="186.92" dur="4.98">spring of 2016 more specifically the</text>
  <text start="189.409" dur="6.241">night of thursday april the seventh</text>
  <text start="191.9" dur="6.03">begins the final shemitah year of this</text>
  <text start="195.65" dur="5.58">50-year cycle so we&amp;#39;re in the 49th year</text>
  <text start="197.93" dur="6.149">of the 50 year cycle begun in the spring</text>
  <text start="201.23" dur="5.219">of 68 which was where the last jubilee</text>
  <text start="204.079" dur="4.44">year ended so this is a shemitah year</text>
  <text start="206.449" dur="4.531">and not only is it a shim it a year</text>
  <text start="208.519" dur="4.59">which happens every seven years but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="4.649">a shemitah of shemitah sits the 49th</text>
  <text start="213.109" dur="4.53">year now the 49th year of a 50 year</text>
  <text start="215.629" dur="4.2">cycle is a shemitah of shem it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.639" dur="4.201">not just a regular shemitah year which</text>
  <text start="219.829" dur="4.861">occurs every seven years the last one</text>
  <text start="221.84" dur="5.16">occurred back in the spring of 2009 to</text>
  <text start="224.69" dur="4.829">the spring of 2010 but it&amp;#39;s a shemitah</text>
  <text start="227" dur="5.4">of shem it&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s this is the only shittier</text>
  <text start="229.519" dur="5.161">in the entire 50-year cycle in which the</text>
  <text start="232.4" dur="5.58">torah commands you to blow a trumpet on</text>
  <text start="234.68" dur="6.119">yom kippur now the reason you blow a</text>
  <text start="237.98" dur="5.939">trumpet on Yom Kippur and a 49th year or</text>
  <text start="240.799" dur="4.951">a shemitah of Shimoda years is because</text>
  <text start="243.919" dur="3.18">you&amp;#39;re announcing the coming Jubilee</text>
  <text start="245.75" dur="5.25">which in this case will begin next</text>
  <text start="247.099" dur="7.741">spring the spring of 2017 this trumpet</text>
  <text start="251" dur="5.13">is used it&amp;#39;s used to a signal that a</text>
  <text start="254.84" dur="3.78">jubilee year is right around the corner</text>
  <text start="256.13" dur="4.77">so this Yom Kippur which occurs in</text>
  <text start="258.62" dur="4.349">October we are commanded to blow a</text>
  <text start="260.9" dur="5.18">trumpet to announce that the Jubilee</text>
  <text start="262.969" dur="6.841">year is coming in the spring of 2007</text>
  <text start="266.08" dur="5.71">now this is very special because and</text>
  <text start="269.81" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;ll talk about this more as we get</text>
  <text start="271.79" dur="4.83">closer to the fall feast later this year</text>
  <text start="273.65" dur="4.17">but what&amp;#39;s really cool about this is you</text>
  <text start="276.62" dur="3.78">know every year of course you have the</text>
  <text start="277.82" dur="4.47">Feast of Trumpets in the fall usually</text>
  <text start="280.4" dur="3.6">september-october and then ten days</text>
  <text start="282.29" dur="4.59">later you have Yom Kippur and Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="284" dur="4.76">is a day of fasting of Prayer you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="286.88" dur="4.8">really celebrating it&amp;#39;s more of a</text>
  <text start="288.76" dur="5.08">chastising and very sober day but this</text>
  <text start="291.68" dur="4.71">year because it&amp;#39;s the 49th years the</text>
  <text start="293.84" dur="4.98">shemitah of shem it&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s the last of the</text>
  <text start="296.39" dur="5.43">seven-year demarcations of the last 49</text>
  <text start="298.82" dur="5.73">years this year we&amp;#39;re committed to blow</text>
  <text start="301.82" dur="5.01">a trumpet on yom kippur ok to announce</text>
  <text start="304.55" dur="4.23">the jubilee next spring so literally</text>
  <text start="306.83" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s like we almost have to feast of</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="2.64">trumpets this year we got the regular</text>
  <text start="310.25" dur="2.94">feast of trumpets that happens every</text>
  <text start="311.42" dur="3.33">year and then ten days later because</text>
  <text start="313.19" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re in the 49th year we are commanded</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="4.2">to blow a trumpet on yom kippur so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="316.97" dur="3.81">like we got a double blow of trumpets</text>
  <text start="318.95" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s a scripture in</text>
  <text start="320.78" dur="3.93">Zechariah which talks about how in the</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="3.63">future in the Millennial Kingdom this</text>
  <text start="324.71" dur="3.9">day of Yom Kippur which is a day of</text>
  <text start="326.21" dur="4.26">fasting and prayer and sobriety will</text>
  <text start="328.61" dur="4.26">literally be transformed into a day of</text>
  <text start="330.47" dur="4.83">celebration and we get a taste of that</text>
  <text start="332.87" dur="4.29">we got a taste of Yom Kippur one of the</text>
  <text start="335.3" dur="3.75">most sober feasts of the year being</text>
  <text start="337.16" dur="4.14">turned into a day of celebration and</text>
  <text start="339.05" dur="5.28">jubilation because we&amp;#39;re commanded this</text>
  <text start="341.3" dur="5.67">year this 49th year to blow that trumpet</text>
  <text start="344.33" dur="4.32">to announce Jubilee next spring so this</text>
  <text start="346.97" dur="3.96">is going to be a very special year now I</text>
  <text start="348.65" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a coincidence that the</text>
  <text start="350.93" dur="4.59">Republican frontrunner for the</text>
  <text start="353.12" dur="5.1">presidency of the United States his last</text>
  <text start="355.52" dur="4.23">name is Trump I have made some other</text>
  <text start="358.22" dur="2.85">videos about Donald Trump&amp;#39;s you can see</text>
  <text start="359.75" dur="3.42">what I think about him but I do believe</text>
  <text start="361.07" dur="4.5">yah is using him as his righteous</text>
  <text start="363.17" dur="4.83">wrecking ball to destroy all the evil</text>
  <text start="365.57" dur="4.17">that past presidents and this society</text>
  <text start="368" dur="4.83">and the media done to this country and</text>
  <text start="369.74" dur="4.68">also use him to rebuild this country and</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="3.78">return this country to its Hebrew roots</text>
  <text start="374.42" dur="4.38">and habit time of season and revival for</text>
  <text start="376.61" dur="4.71">this country so isn&amp;#39;t it interesting</text>
  <text start="378.8" dur="4.98">that on Yom Kippur which will occur this</text>
  <text start="381.32" dur="5.55">October we are commanded to lift up a</text>
  <text start="383.78" dur="5.76">trump and to blow that trumpet and in</text>
  <text start="386.87" dur="5.82">the presidential politics a man with the</text>
  <text start="389.54" dur="4.98">last name of Trump could very well come</text>
  <text start="392.69" dur="3.75">to an electoral landslide victory</text>
  <text start="394.52" dur="3.15">against either Hillary Clinton or Bernie</text>

  <text start="397.67" dur="3.42">become the next president nited states</text>

  <text start="566.4" dur="3.27">commanded literally during this schmitty</text>
  <text start="567.84" dur="4.32">or not to work their fields they were</text>
  <text start="569.67" dur="4.14">not 22 so to reap or anything like that</text>
  <text start="572.16" dur="3.09">yah would provide the sustenance now</text>
  <text start="573.81" dur="3.18">they still took care of their animals</text>
  <text start="575.25" dur="4.68">and things like that but basically</text>
  <text start="576.99" dur="4.86">because tilling the land and farming the</text>
  <text start="579.93" dur="4.26">land and reaping the land that took up</text>
  <text start="581.85" dur="4.14">so much of their time because they</text>
  <text start="584.19" dur="3.96">didn&amp;#39;t have to do that for this next 12</text>
  <text start="585.99" dur="4.02">months they had a lot of free time they</text>
  <text start="588.15" dur="3.39">were able to rest and relax and and</text>
  <text start="590.01" dur="3.84">still take care of some things but</text>
  <text start="591.54" dur="4.86">generally rest and relax rely on y&amp;#39;all</text>
  <text start="593.85" dur="4.32">go closer to do ministry what did</text>
  <text start="596.4" dur="5.01">Yahshua do on the Sabbath day if you</text>
  <text start="598.17" dur="4.32">read the New Testament on the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="601.41" dur="3.27">day is when he would go to the</text>
  <text start="602.49" dur="3.96">synagogue&amp;#39;s to preach and teach on the</text>
  <text start="604.68" dur="4.83">Sabbath day is when he would go heal</text>
  <text start="606.45" dur="5.79">okay so this is a day of ministry and of</text>
  <text start="609.51" dur="4.68">rest of relaxation so this year this</text>
  <text start="612.24" dur="4.86">Sabbath year for the next 12 months</text>
  <text start="614.19" dur="6.24">should be a year of rest of relaxation</text>
  <text start="617.1" dur="5.16">of healing of ministry of being able to</text>
  <text start="620.43" dur="3">yeah we still take care of our</text>
  <text start="622.26" dur="3.99">day-to-day things but being able to</text>
  <text start="623.43" dur="4.47">Center more on the things of yaad more</text>
  <text start="626.25" dur="3.75">on ministering and ministering to others</text>
  <text start="627.9" dur="4.05">administering the yacht blessing him and</text>
  <text start="630" dur="3.96">blessing those round ISM bringing those</text>
  <text start="631.95" dur="4.65">around us who may be living wrongly to</text>
  <text start="633.96" dur="4.71">repentance and helping him convince an</text>
  <text start="636.6" dur="3.84">and to do the right things for him and</text>
  <text start="638.67" dur="4.65">this should really be a special year to</text>
  <text start="640.44" dur="5.22">do that now of course we don&amp;#39;t live in</text>
  <text start="643.32" dur="4.89">an agricultural based society now very</text>
  <text start="645.66" dur="5.37">few of us in this day and age are</text>
  <text start="648.21" dur="5.16">farmers okay if we were a farmer we were</text>
  <text start="651.03" dur="3.66">to definitely not work the fields this</text>
  <text start="653.37" dur="2.969">year that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s a definite but I</text>
  <text start="654.69" dur="3.6">think we can also take some applications</text>
  <text start="656.339" dur="4.201">to apply this Torah commandment</text>
  <text start="658.29" dur="4.169">modern day life so I think for instance</text>
  <text start="660.54" dur="3.51">what we should be careful to do is if we</text>
  <text start="662.459" dur="3.87">do have gardens for instance we should</text>
  <text start="664.05" dur="4.83">not do our gardens this year not for the</text>
  <text start="666.329" dur="4.26">next 12 months and actually it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="668.88" dur="3.54">to be more than 12 months because this</text>
  <text start="670.589" dur="3">is not a normal shemitah year it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="672.42" dur="3.75">shipment of Schmidt is so what that</text>
  <text start="673.589" dur="4.891">means is once the shemitah year is over</text>
  <text start="676.17" dur="4.529">once the Sabbath eater is over we then</text>
  <text start="678.48" dur="4.44">begin the jubilee which the jubilee is a</text>
  <text start="680.699" dur="3.991">another quote unquote Sabbath here we</text>
  <text start="682.92" dur="3.57">literally have two Sabbath ears back to</text>
  <text start="684.69" dur="3.99">back because we have the 49th year and</text>
  <text start="686.49" dur="4.8">then Jubilee so really for the next 24</text>
  <text start="688.68" dur="4.62">months for the next two years we are not</text>
  <text start="691.29" dur="3.84">to work our gardens or work the fields</text>
  <text start="693.3" dur="4.17">and and yeah we&amp;#39;ll provide this essence</text>
  <text start="695.13" dur="4.29">but I think we can take it beyond even</text>
  <text start="697.47" dur="4.619">just the gardens in the end being if</text>
  <text start="699.42" dur="4.2">you&amp;#39;re a farmer I think that really what</text>
  <text start="702.089" dur="2.641">a shemitah year should be what we should</text>
  <text start="703.62" dur="2.67">be praying and what I&amp;#39;m going to be</text>
  <text start="704.73" dur="3">praying and I encourage you who are</text>
  <text start="706.29" dur="5.669">listening to this podcast that you would</text>
  <text start="707.73" dur="7.229">pray for this as well we pray yeah or I</text>
  <text start="711.959" dur="5.37">straight events in my life practically</text>
  <text start="714.959" dur="5.281">so that I don&amp;#39;t have to spend the year</text>
  <text start="717.329" dur="6.331">working and toiling and doing all these</text>
  <text start="720.24" dur="5.55">you know grimy elbow grease you know</text>
  <text start="723.66" dur="3.75">work work work are hard things that I</text>
  <text start="725.79" dur="3.15">normally have to do the preview that</text>
  <text start="727.41" dur="3.72">I&amp;#39;ve had to the last six years let give</text>
  <text start="728.94" dur="4.47">me a time of rest you know somehow give</text>
  <text start="731.13" dur="4.8">me a time of rest I know for me</text>
  <text start="733.41" dur="4.47">personally what I would love is I just</text>
  <text start="735.93" dur="4.32">finished writing a manuscript a book and</text>
  <text start="737.88" dur="3.87">I would love to get a literary agent and</text>
  <text start="740.25" dur="3.87">have that literary agent you know sell</text>
  <text start="741.75" dur="4.35">it to a big publishing company and you</text>
  <text start="744.12" dur="3.6">know become a successful author and that</text>
  <text start="746.1" dur="3.87">would allow me to rest it would allow me</text>
  <text start="747.72" dur="4.349">not to have to you know work my day job</text>
  <text start="749.97" dur="4.53">and I could rest and right maybe do</text>
  <text start="752.069" dur="4.051">preaching and center more time on</text>
  <text start="754.5" dur="3.12">ministry which is what I&amp;#39;m praying for</text>
  <text start="756.12" dur="3.029">so I&amp;#39;m praying for that breakthrough for</text>
  <text start="757.62" dur="3.99">this committee or that would be the</text>
  <text start="759.149" dur="4.591">perfect way for me to practically I</text>
  <text start="761.61" dur="3.24">think rest and relax and center our</text>
  <text start="763.74" dur="2.94">ministry and be able to have that</text>
  <text start="764.85" dur="4.169">financial freedom to do a zoom in here</text>
  <text start="766.68" dur="3.959">so that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m praying for but you</text>
  <text start="769.019" dur="3.361">know whether God does that or not i</text>
  <text start="770.639" dur="5.461">think we should all have in our hearts</text>
  <text start="772.38" dur="6.48">y&amp;#39;all show us how can we truly rest and</text>
  <text start="776.1" dur="6.299">relax and center more ministry during</text>
  <text start="778.86" dur="5.159">this very special Schmidty ER and i do</text>
  <text start="782.399" dur="3.091">believe that yeah because it is a shim</text>
  <text start="784.019" dur="3.391">it a year and you know these times R</text>
  <text start="785.49" dur="3.99">times he sat down these are appointed</text>
  <text start="787.41" dur="4.09">his appointed times but he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="789.48" dur="4.18">allow us to have a certain kind of rest</text>
  <text start="791.5" dur="4.29">even just spiritually and what I mean by</text>
  <text start="793.66" dur="3.87">that is you know last six years man</text>
  <text start="795.79" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;ve had satanic attacks I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="797.53" dur="3.57">pounded by the enemy and we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="798.97" dur="4.14">spiritual struggles and I think what yah</text>
  <text start="801.1" dur="4.38">wants to do for this next year and the</text>
  <text start="803.11" dur="4.17">year beyond that the Jubilee year is to</text>
  <text start="805.48" dur="3.93">give us a time of rest spiritual rest</text>
  <text start="807.28" dur="3.36">where the enemies not hammering us all</text>
  <text start="809.41" dur="2.31">the time we&amp;#39;re not going through</text>
  <text start="810.64" dur="3.42">spiritual struggles where we&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="811.72" dur="4.83">being strengthened the odds giving us</text>
  <text start="814.06" dur="4.5">strength where we&amp;#39;re actually overcoming</text>
  <text start="816.55" dur="3.15">and victorious and I mean of course we</text>
  <text start="818.56" dur="2.76">should always be overcoming in</text>
  <text start="819.7" dur="4.44">victorious but I mean where you guys</text>
  <text start="821.32" dur="4.35">giving that us an extra strength a wall</text>
  <text start="824.14" dur="4.11">round us from the enemy where we can</text>
  <text start="825.67" dur="4.47">have some rest and I&amp;#39;m not saying the</text>
  <text start="828.25" dur="3.24">Satan&amp;#39;s not going to stop bothering with</text>
  <text start="830.14" dur="2.7">us of course Satan and the enemy is</text>
  <text start="831.49" dur="3.75">always out there we got to be sober and</text>
  <text start="832.84" dur="4.68">vigilant but i think these next 24</text>

  <text start="837.52" dur="3.36">give you guys a breather won&amp;#39;t give you</text>
  <text start="838.9" dur="3.93">guys a time of rest and rejuvenation and</text>
  <text start="840.88" dur="3.63">I&amp;#39;m gonna do things to keep the enemy</text>
  <text start="842.83" dur="3.9">from harassing you as much as he has</text>
  <text start="844.51" dur="5.19">these six years and give you 24 months</text>
  <text start="846.73" dur="6.78">to draw close to me and to celebrate me</text>
  <text start="849.7" dur="5.61">into and to give you a reprieve from the</text>
  <text start="853.51" dur="4.079">enemy so that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m looking forward</text>
  <text start="855.31" dur="3.9">to I do though believe that there still</text>
  <text start="857.589" dur="4.231">will be some very heightened spiritual</text>
  <text start="859.21" dur="5.97">warfare nationally on the national scale</text>
  <text start="861.82" dur="6.03">in this nation over this next shittier</text>
  <text start="865.18" dur="4.68">because we&amp;#39;re in probably the most</text>
  <text start="867.85" dur="3.69">important election presidential election</text>
  <text start="869.86" dur="3.45">that this nation&amp;#39;s ever faced and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="871.54" dur="5.4">you know almost two hundred forty years</text>
  <text start="873.31" dur="6.54">of history Donald Trump must be elected</text>
  <text start="876.94" dur="5.22">if we&amp;#39;re to see a return of revival and</text>
  <text start="879.85" dur="4.65">prosperity and and of righteousness to</text>
  <text start="882.16" dur="4.23">this nation if he&amp;#39;s not if we get a</text>
  <text start="884.5" dur="3.81">Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders I mean</text>
  <text start="886.39" dur="5.31">judgments coming it&amp;#39;s over this nation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="888.31" dur="5.82">gone so it&amp;#39;s very pivotal and you know</text>
  <text start="891.7" dur="4.83">the fourth hebrew month which will be in</text>
  <text start="894.13" dur="4.11">july this year that&amp;#39;s the month where</text>
  <text start="896.53" dur="2.91">the republicans have their national</text>
  <text start="898.24" dur="3.57">commission in cleveland i think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="899.44" dur="4.68">going to be a crucial time that fourth</text>
  <text start="901.81" dur="5.49">month and there&amp;#39;s a lot of scriptures</text>
  <text start="904.12" dur="4.56">about the fourth month in it you know if</text>
  <text start="907.3" dur="2.88">you look at the tour in the prophets</text>
  <text start="908.68" dur="2.67">there&amp;#39;s a lot of mentions about the</text>
  <text start="910.18" dur="3">fourth month so the fourth month for</text>
  <text start="911.35" dur="4.2">instance is when Ezekiel got his visions</text>
  <text start="913.18" dur="4.68">revelation so that fourth month is going</text>
  <text start="915.55" dur="4.289">to be a time of Revelation visions for</text>
  <text start="917.86" dur="3.44">his people and you can read about that</text>
  <text start="919.839" dur="3.68">Musial one</text>
  <text start="921.3" dur="6.63">if you go to some other passages in</text>
  <text start="923.519" dur="6.38">Jeremiah 52 I believe you&amp;#39;ll find how</text>
  <text start="927.93" dur="4.56">the fourth month was the month in which</text>
  <text start="929.899" dur="4.931">the city was broken the Jerusalem was</text>
  <text start="932.49" dur="5.25">broken and the wicked leaders of Israel</text>
  <text start="934.83" dur="4.8">Zedekiah and his sort of entourage they</text>
  <text start="937.74" dur="3">were destroyed they tried to escape they</text>
  <text start="939.63" dur="3.81">were destroyed they were taken captive</text>
  <text start="940.74" dur="4.469">they were killed so the establishment or</text>
  <text start="943.44" dur="3.389">the wicked leaders of Israel during that</text>
  <text start="945.209" dur="3.69">time were destroyed during the fourth</text>
  <text start="946.829" dur="3.781">month and I pray that the Republican</text>
  <text start="948.899" dur="6.571">establishment that&amp;#39;s tried trying to</text>
  <text start="950.61" dur="6.09">deny Trump his his rightful nomination</text>
  <text start="955.47" dur="5.549">as votes will be destroyed in that</text>
  <text start="956.7" dur="5.699">fourth month and then and i don&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="961.019" dur="3.391">destroyed physically I mean that yah</text>
  <text start="962.399" dur="4.111">would prevent them from having victory</text>
  <text start="964.41" dur="4.59">in that you know Trump would come to to</text>
  <text start="966.51" dur="4.23">clinch the GOP nomination and then</text>
  <text start="969" dur="4.529">there&amp;#39;s another interesting mention of</text>
  <text start="970.74" dur="5.4">of the fourth month in in second</text>
  <text start="973.529" dur="4.74">chronicles where we read about a Sahel</text>
  <text start="976.14" dur="4.259">and a Sahel was one of David&amp;#39;s mighty</text>
  <text start="978.269" dur="4.32">men he was very the scripture says he</text>
  <text start="980.399" dur="3.781">was swift as a deer swift as a row he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="982.589" dur="5.581">very fleet of foot he could be an</text>
  <text start="984.18" dur="5.88">Olympian I mean he could run fast and he</text>
  <text start="988.17" dur="4.169">asked the hell is actually literally he</text>
  <text start="990.06" dur="4.589">was appointed the fourth captain and he</text>
  <text start="992.339" dur="4.111">was in charge of the fourth month in</text>
  <text start="994.649" dur="4.56">terms of military things so the fourth</text>
  <text start="996.45" dur="4.59">month was a cells and a Sahel you know</text>
  <text start="999.209" dur="4.13">he was nimble afoot very smart very</text>
  <text start="1001.04" dur="5.63">intelligent he he race really fast but</text>
  <text start="1003.339" dur="7.451">he was chasing after Abner who was the</text>
  <text start="1006.67" dur="6.49">basically the Armed Forces leader the</text>
  <text start="1010.79" dur="4.65">commander of Saul&amp;#39;s army and so of</text>
  <text start="1013.16" dur="4.29">course it was dead at this time but he</text>
  <text start="1015.44" dur="3.99">was the sort of the second command under</text>
  <text start="1017.45" dur="3.9">King saw and Abner was actually a</text>
  <text start="1019.43" dur="4.29">nobleman I mean Abner was used by yacht</text>
  <text start="1021.35" dur="4.17">to basically eventually bring the</text>
  <text start="1023.72" dur="5.489">remaining ten tribes underneath David&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1025.52" dur="6.419">leadership but a Sahel was determined to</text>
  <text start="1029.209" dur="4.261">kill Abner and he kept chasing him to</text>
  <text start="1031.939" dur="3">chase him and amber said look you got to</text>
  <text start="1033.47" dur="3.81">stop this I don&amp;#39;t want to have to kill</text>
  <text start="1034.939" dur="4.711">you but as the hell didn&amp;#39;t listen he</text>
  <text start="1037.28" dur="3.779">stayed focused on trying to kill Abner</text>
  <text start="1039.65" dur="2.97">and so I haven&amp;#39;t eventually had to use a</text>
  <text start="1041.059" dur="3.78">spear and it caught him under the Fifth</text>
  <text start="1042.62" dur="4.709">rib went out his back and NASA all died</text>
  <text start="1044.839" dur="4.981">and then there was sort of a cessation</text>
  <text start="1047.329" dur="4.381">of hostilities a civil war kind of had</text>
  <text start="1049.82" dur="3.69">some rest there in Israel but the point</text>
  <text start="1051.71" dur="3.03">is is that a Sahel you know he&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1053.51" dur="4.2">nimble light of</text>
  <text start="1054.74" dur="5.88">he&amp;#39;s very much like Ted Cruz okay and</text>
  <text start="1057.71" dur="4.29">Abner very gruff you know say it as it</text>
  <text start="1060.62" dur="3.18">is sort of commander of the Armed Forces</text>
  <text start="1062" dur="2.94">he&amp;#39;s very much like Trump and so I think</text>
  <text start="1063.8" dur="3.3">we&amp;#39;re going to see in the fourth month</text>
  <text start="1064.94" dur="5.34">of this sort of spiritual thing is going</text>
  <text start="1067.1" dur="4.14">to play out where truck doesn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1070.28" dur="2.94">do it but he&amp;#39;s going to have to take</text>
  <text start="1071.24" dur="5.67">crews out and you know politically</text>
  <text start="1073.22" dur="4.92">speaking and and I think Cruz is going</text>
  <text start="1076.91" dur="2.58">to suffer defeat and I don&amp;#39;t think Cruz</text>

  <text start="1181.61" dur="4.14">of the population the United States but</text>
  <text start="1184.73" dur="2.28">the other thing that was really</text>
  <text start="1185.75" dur="2.34">interesting</text>
  <text start="1187.01" dur="4.62">that I just want to talk about briefly</text>
  <text start="1188.09" dur="5.46">is if you actually look at the numbers</text>
  <text start="1191.63" dur="5.49">of the final numbers and I think right</text>
  <text start="1193.55" dur="5.88">now as of this New Year&amp;#39;s Day on april</text>
  <text start="1197.12" dur="4.17">eight friday a ninety nine percent of</text>
  <text start="1199.43" dur="3.9">the vote has been tallied in wisconsin</text>
  <text start="1201.29" dur="8.67">and I&amp;#39;ve that ninety-nine percent of the</text>
  <text start="1203.33" dur="10.65">vote Cruz got 530 1129 votes and Donald</text>
  <text start="1209.96" dur="5.64">Trump got 380 6370 votes well I was</text>
  <text start="1213.98" dur="3.18">seeking yah about this any you know he</text>
  <text start="1215.6" dur="5.91">said do the math do the math so I took</text>
  <text start="1217.16" dur="9.41">the 531 129,000 votes that Ted Cruz</text>
  <text start="1221.51" dur="8.73">managed to get and I also took the 380</text>
  <text start="1226.57" dur="5.29">6370 votes that Donald Trump God and the</text>
  <text start="1230.24" dur="5.99">difference between those is a hundred</text>
  <text start="1231.86" dur="6.18">and forty 4759 or very close you know</text>
  <text start="1236.23" dur="4.21">relatively speaking very close to the</text>
  <text start="1238.04" dur="3.99">number 144 thousand now if you&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="1240.44" dur="2.79">picked up the book of Revelation the</text>
  <text start="1242.03" dur="2.94">last book of the Bible and read it</text>
  <text start="1243.23" dur="4.23">you&amp;#39;re probably pretty familiar with</text>
  <text start="1244.97" dur="4.05">that number 144 thousand there are</text>
  <text start="1247.46" dur="3.51">twelve thousand from each of the twelve</text>
  <text start="1249.02" dur="4.56">tribes of Israel that will be anointed</text>
  <text start="1250.97" dur="4.83">and sealed and protected during the time</text>
  <text start="1253.58" dur="3.84">of the Great Tribulation and so what I</text>
  <text start="1255.8" dur="4.73">saw here is that there were a hundred</text>
  <text start="1257.42" dur="7.35">proximately 144,000 voters in Wisconsin</text>
  <text start="1260.53" dur="6.13">that voted for Ted Cruz that if they had</text>
  <text start="1264.77" dur="3.69">voted for Donald Trump Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="1266.66" dur="4.5">would be the winner and Ted Cruz would</text>
  <text start="1268.46" dur="4.23">not be and what yeah i think was showing</text>
  <text start="1271.16" dur="5.43">me is that in wisconsin you got that</text>
  <text start="1272.69" dur="5.94">counterfeit 144,000 that false 144,000</text>
  <text start="1276.59" dur="6.18">you know Satan always has a counterfeit</text>
  <text start="1278.63" dur="7.64">or a you know a false version of what</text>
  <text start="1282.77" dur="6.8">yah has does and so here we have a false</text>
  <text start="1286.27" dur="6.4">144,000 a counterfeit 144,000 that</text>
  <text start="1289.57" dur="6.01">coronated or anointed this wicked Ted</text>
  <text start="1292.67" dur="4.32">Cruz to to win Wisconsin and now Ted</text>
  <text start="1295.58" dur="3.87">Cruz trying to say look it&amp;#39;s a turning</text>
  <text start="1296.99" dur="7.17">point I could win and you know he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1299.45" dur="6.9">win he has no viable path to secure 1237</text>
  <text start="1304.16" dur="3.81">delegates that are needed to get the</text>
  <text start="1306.35" dur="2.94">nomination he can&amp;#39;t do it there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="1307.97" dur="3.3">he&amp;#39;d have to get like I think it was</text>
  <text start="1309.29" dur="3.72">like 95 or ninety-seven percent of the</text>
  <text start="1311.27" dur="3.21">remaining delegates and that&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="1313.01" dur="3.27">possible especially with the states that</text>
  <text start="1314.48" dur="5.19">are coming up where he&amp;#39;s not popular at</text>
  <text start="1316.28" dur="4.62">all like New York in the Northeast trum</text>
  <text start="1319.67" dur="3">however even though he</text>
  <text start="1320.9" dur="4.14">cleaned i think it was six delegates</text>
  <text start="1322.67" dur="4.2">from Wisconsin he only needs to get</text>
  <text start="1325.04" dur="3.18">anywhere from forty three to forty seven</text>
  <text start="1326.87" dur="5.01">percent of the remaining delegates so</text>
  <text start="1328.22" dur="6.99">trunk still has a very likely path to</text>
  <text start="1331.88" dur="5.82">clinch the minimum 1237 delegates to</text>
  <text start="1335.21" dur="4.08">avoid a contested convention and become</text>
  <text start="1337.7" dur="3.66">the presumptive nominee before well</text>
  <text start="1339.29" dur="3.75">before the Republican convention in</text>
  <text start="1341.36" dur="4.02">Cleveland but I just wanted to point</text>
  <text start="1343.04" dur="3.3">this out that there&amp;#39;s that false 144,000</text>
  <text start="1345.38" dur="2.52">so I think it was just another</text>
  <text start="1346.34" dur="4.65">confirmation yeah I was using to say</text>
  <text start="1347.9" dur="6.66">look Wisconsin the state of sin is a</text>
  <text start="1350.99" dur="6.33">place of wickedness of establishment</text>
  <text start="1354.56" dur="4.05">types of even the so-called conservative</text>
  <text start="1357.32" dur="3.6">radio talk show hosts were very</text>

  <text start="1365.6" dur="4.35">in Dominion theology if you&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="1367.85" dur="4.59">studied out what Dominion theology is it</text>
  <text start="1369.95" dur="5.28">is very wicked this as a belief that the</text>

  <text start="1388.61" dur="4.08">what they believe I mean it&amp;#39;s absolute</text>
  <text start="1390.56" dur="4.08">lunacy there&amp;#39;s no basis for that in</text>
  <text start="1392.69" dur="4.26">Scripture anywhere in fact if anything</text>
  <text start="1394.64" dur="4.29">ever does come of this Dominion theology</text>
  <text start="1396.95" dur="4.65">it will be that the church the so-called</text>
  <text start="1398.93" dur="5.22">church will be used to usher in the</text>
  <text start="1401.6" dur="3.9">Antichrist although though they&amp;#39;ll think</text>

  <text start="1672.289" dur="3.99">months away now from the Jubilee year</text>
  <text start="1674.39" dur="5.46">which I&amp;#39;m expecting that year to be</text>
  <text start="1676.279" dur="7.351">amazing you know keep in mind in 1948 ok</text>
  <text start="1679.85" dur="6.709">almost 70 years ago that was when the</text>
  <text start="1683.63" dur="5.549">Jews took back the land and then a</text>
  <text start="1686.559" dur="5.59">little bit later 1967 when you had that</text>
  <text start="1689.179" dur="5.551">Jubilee year okay they took back</text>
  <text start="1692.149" dur="4.53">Jerusalem they took back Jerusalem the</text>
  <text start="1694.73" dur="3.449">city the first they took the land in the</text>
  <text start="1696.679" dur="2.97">took the city now we&amp;#39;re coming to the</text>
  <text start="1698.179" dur="2.791">next you believe that starts next spring</text>
  <text start="1699.649" dur="4.321">and I really believe that between the</text>
  <text start="1700.97" dur="4.86">spring of 2017 and Springer 2018 we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1703.97" dur="3.75">going to see the Jews not just have the</text>
  <text start="1705.83" dur="3.12">land in the city but now take the Temple</text>
  <text start="1707.72" dur="1.69">Mount and the book going to have their</text>
  <text start="1708.95" dur="1.78">temple</text>
  <text start="1709.41" dur="4.1">now that doesn&amp;#39;t mean the Great</text>
  <text start="1710.73" dur="4.98">Tribulation this really has to start</text>
  <text start="1713.51" dur="4.18">because we could have the temple going</text>
  <text start="1715.71" dur="3.3">and having things going on in the temple</text>
  <text start="1717.69" dur="3.39">for many many years before the</text>
  <text start="1719.01" dur="5.13">tribulation actually starts the Bible is</text>
  <text start="1721.08" dur="4.98">kind of silent on that well maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1724.14" dur="5.72">not quite silent because there is daniel</text>
  <text start="1726.06" dur="7.5">9 that talks about the was it the 20</text>
  <text start="1729.86" dur="6.52">2,700 2,800 days of sacrifices which is</text>
  <text start="1733.56" dur="4.92">about seven point three four years or</text>
  <text start="1736.38" dur="4.17">something so maybe there is a timeline</text>
  <text start="1738.48" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;ll have to explore that later but in</text>
  <text start="1740.55" dur="4.86">any case if that temple goes up and we</text>
  <text start="1742.8" dur="3.99">see those animal sacrifices going wow we</text>
  <text start="1745.41" dur="6.03">know we&amp;#39;re definitely living in perfect</text>
  <text start="1746.79" dur="6.93">times but even so if Trump wins I think</text>
  <text start="1751.44" dur="3.51">a lot of these at least the negative</text>
  <text start="1753.72" dur="4.08">prophecies of the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="1754.95" dur="4.65">might be pushed back and the church</text>
  <text start="1757.8" dur="4.62">might be allowed I shouldn&amp;#39;t say the</text>
  <text start="1759.6" dur="5.4">church Israel true Israel okay those who</text>
  <text start="1762.42" dur="4.5">love Yahshua love his Torah clever by</text>

  <text start="1766.92" dur="3.45">rise up return to righteousness and</text>
  <text start="1768.66" dur="4.56">bring in a final harvest before that</text>
  <text start="1770.37" dur="4.2">great tribulation begins so I&amp;#39;m excited</text>

  <text start="1800.82" dur="3.63">I&amp;#39;ve brought up a lot of different</text>
  <text start="1802.17" dur="3.81">topics but now remember all of these</text>
  <text start="1804.45" dur="3.87">things whether it&amp;#39;s politics whether</text>
  <text start="1805.98" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s spiritual principles Scripture</text>
  <text start="1808.32" dur="3.33">whether it&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;re living our lives</text>
  <text start="1809.85" dur="3.33">our families our work all of these</text>
  <text start="1811.65" dur="3.69">things are interconnected they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1813.18" dur="3.93">interwoven they all affect each other so</text>
  <text start="1815.34" dur="3.51">we can&amp;#39;t just say well let&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="1817.11" dur="3.42">politics aside and just talk about</text>
  <text start="1818.85" dur="3.36">religion or let&amp;#39;s put spiritual things</text>
  <text start="1820.53" dur="4.17">aside just talk about politics you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1822.21" dur="5.73">do that because a life doesn&amp;#39;t work that</text>
  <text start="1824.7" dur="5.97">way it&amp;#39;s one whole organic thing and</text>
  <text start="1827.94" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s all interconnected so that&amp;#39;s how we</text>
  <text start="1830.67" dur="2.88">need to tackle and that&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;ve tried</text>
  <text start="1832.17" dur="5.67">to tackle this pockets I just tried to</text>
  <text start="1833.55" dur="6.63">very clearly articulate my thoughts and</text>
  <text start="1837.84" dur="4.11">my feelings and what I&amp;#39;m hoping and</text>
  <text start="1840.18" dur="2.42">praying for as we&amp;#39;re beginning this new</text>
  <text start="1841.95" dur="2.78">year</text>
  <text start="1842.6" dur="4.41">and this is an incredible new year I</text>
  <text start="1844.73" dur="3.96">mean to be na not only a new year to be</text>
  <text start="1847.01" dur="3.409">not only in a shemitah year to be not</text>

  <text start="1850.419" dur="4.421">but to be you know literally 12 months</text>
  <text start="1853.309" dur="3.921">away from a jubilee which only happens</text>
  <text start="1854.84" dur="5.13">folks so jubilee is once every 50 years</text>
  <text start="1857.23" dur="4.36">so even if you live to be 80 you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1859.97" dur="4.35">probably only going to see one jubilee</text>
  <text start="1861.59" dur="4.26">in your lifetime because it happens</text>
  <text start="1864.32" dur="7.05">every 50 years unless you live to be you</text>
  <text start="1865.85" dur="8.459">know 100 so this is a time to rejoice to</text>
  <text start="1871.37" dur="4.62">celebrate to say wow happy new Sabbath</text>
  <text start="1874.309" dur="3.031">you&amp;#39;re happy new shipment a year is the</text>
  <text start="1875.99" dur="2.939">shemitah year now I know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1877.34" dur="3.209">are saying well like wait a minute the I</text>
  <text start="1878.929" dur="3.151">felt the Jewish Knesset Jonathan</text>
  <text start="1880.549" dur="3.451">Connolly&amp;#39;s guy said that last year was</text>
  <text start="1882.08" dur="4.65">this ship in your here was 2015 is just</text>
  <text start="1884" dur="6.39">you know and it ended well they&amp;#39;re wrong</text>
  <text start="1886.73" dur="6.39">okay they&amp;#39;re wrong because a lot of</text>
  <text start="1890.39" dur="4.56">proof that 1967 was definitely the last</text>
  <text start="1893.12" dur="5.039">Sabbath year are suiting the last</text>
  <text start="1894.95" dur="5.459">Jubilee here and then once that Jubilee</text>
  <text start="1898.159" dur="4.471">is over you start over okay now some</text>
  <text start="1900.409" dur="4.26">people try to say oh no the the 49th</text>
  <text start="1902.63" dur="3.779">year that Schmidty years also counted as</text>
  <text start="1904.669" dur="4.74">a jubilee year and you know it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1906.409" dur="5.071">go cycles of 49 not but that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="1909.409" dur="4.531">folks okay this whole cycle is based in</text>
  <text start="1911.48" dur="3.9">Torah when you every year when you get</text>
  <text start="1913.94" dur="3.03">to the feast of first fruits which is</text>
  <text start="1915.38" dur="3.83">the day after the Sabbath within the</text>
  <text start="1916.97" dur="6.15">seven days of unleavened bread you count</text>
  <text start="1919.21" dur="5.89">49 days okay you got an omer 49 days</text>
  <text start="1923.12" dur="3.809">plus one okay so you go from first</text>
  <text start="1925.1" dur="4.38">fruits which always on top birthday week</text>
  <text start="1926.929" dur="5.191">all the way to seven weeks x 7 and then</text>
  <text start="1929.48" dur="5.79">that first day of the week which would</text>
  <text start="1932.12" dur="4.86">be plus 1 49 plus 1 is 50 so it&amp;#39;s 50</text>
  <text start="1935.27" dur="3.899">days of counting the over until you get</text>
  <text start="1936.98" dur="4.71">to chaperone and it&amp;#39;s the same principle</text>
  <text start="1939.169" dur="5.731">just done in years for this where you</text>
  <text start="1941.69" dur="5.76">have 49 years you got seven cycles of</text>
  <text start="1944.9" dur="4.68">seven years and then after that 49th</text>
  <text start="1947.45" dur="4.89">year you then have a jubilee year okay</text>
  <text start="1949.58" dur="4.38">and keep in mind the reason why we are</text>
  <text start="1952.34" dur="3.27">able to rest and relax and why the</text>
  <text start="1953.96" dur="5.28">farmers didn&amp;#39;t have to till the fields</text>
  <text start="1955.61" dur="6.39">for basically 24 months is because</text>
  <text start="1959.24" dur="4.439">yahwah&amp;#39;s going to provide throughout</text>
  <text start="1962" dur="2.97">that Schmidt a year he was going to</text>
  <text start="1963.679" dur="2.551">provide sustenance throughout the</text>
  <text start="1964.97" dur="2.76">Jubilee year and then he even said he</text>
  <text start="1966.23" dur="3.75">would provide sustenance for the next</text>
  <text start="1967.73" dur="5.28">year that first year after the Jubilee</text>
  <text start="1969.98" dur="4.65">while the farmers were now planting and</text>
  <text start="1973.01" dur="2.64">and making sure everything was getting</text>
  <text start="1974.63" dur="3.33">ready so that</text>
  <text start="1975.65" dur="5.49">when they were able to reap you know</text>
  <text start="1977.96" dur="4.58">which wouldn&amp;#39;t happen for even going now</text>
  <text start="1981.14" dur="4.65">into the second year of the next cycle</text>
  <text start="1982.54" dur="4.42">they would still have food of you know</text>
  <text start="1985.79" dur="3.6">they would still have the sessions from</text>
  <text start="1986.96" dur="3.99">y&amp;#39;all even through that okay so yah will</text>
  <text start="1989.39" dur="2.55">more than make up and taking care of</text>
  <text start="1990.95" dur="2.52">this thing and that you know the same</text>
  <text start="1991.94" dur="3.81">principle applies when we get married</text>
  <text start="1993.47" dur="3.99">the Torah says that husbands commanded</text>
  <text start="1995.75" dur="3.51">not to go to war not to work not to do</text>
  <text start="1997.46" dur="4.29">business but to spend the first year of</text>
  <text start="1999.26" dur="4.08">his married life with his bride so how</text>
  <text start="2001.75" dur="4.08">can you do that you got to work out to</text>
  <text start="2003.34" dur="4.17">provide yah provides he provides a way</text>
  <text start="2005.83" dur="4.01">to keep the Torah so we need to have</text>
  <text start="2007.51" dur="4.65">that faith to trust him and obey Him and</text>
  <text start="2009.84" dur="4">please understand me i&amp;#39;m not saying oh</text>
  <text start="2012.16" dur="3.27">we&amp;#39;re at a shipment of year ago quit</text>
  <text start="2013.84" dur="3.63">your job that&amp;#39;s not what i&amp;#39;m saying okay</text>
  <text start="2015.43" dur="4.26">because really technically this applies</text>
  <text start="2017.47" dur="3.81">to farmers into agriculture what i am</text>
  <text start="2019.69" dur="2.91">saying is why can&amp;#39;t we have the faith to</text>
  <text start="2021.28" dur="3.57">say you know what it&amp;#39;s a shemitah year</text>
  <text start="2022.6" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s your rest it&amp;#39;s a year where i</text>
  <text start="2024.85" dur="3.36">should be able to spend more time in</text>
  <text start="2026.2" dur="3.33">ministry and rest than with my job that</text>
  <text start="2028.21" dur="4.65">I&amp;#39;ve been doing the last six years</text>
  <text start="2029.53" dur="5.67">whatever yeah can you work things in my</text>
  <text start="2032.86" dur="4.71">life to allow me to do that and in my</text>
  <text start="2035.2" dur="3.87">situation it&amp;#39;s you know become a</text>
  <text start="2037.57" dur="3">full-time offer and then I would be able</text>
  <text start="2039.07" dur="3.33">to have the financial freedom to preach</text>
  <text start="2040.57" dur="3.48">and do things Martin not have to be</text>
  <text start="2042.4" dur="5.61">engaged in the elbow grease of everyday</text>
  <text start="2044.05" dur="6.96">life so why can&amp;#39;t we take that faith and</text>
  <text start="2048.01" dur="4.23">and i think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the important</text>
  <text start="2051.01" dur="3.99">takeaway here that we can have that</text>
  <text start="2052.24" dur="4.679">faith to really enjoy the shemitah year</text>
