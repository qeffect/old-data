  <text start="2.49" dur="4.59">Torah restoration ministries it is the</text>
  <text start="4.23" dur="5.789">first day of the week Sunday September</text>
  <text start="7.08" dur="5.099">the 24th we&amp;#39;re now on the day for of</text>
  <text start="10.019" dur="4.321">these days of all the days of the</text>
  <text start="12.179" dur="2.761">blowing of the seventh Trump the days of</text>
  <text start="14.34" dur="3.72">yom teruah</text>
  <text start="14.94" dur="5.429">in our 10-day countdown to yom kippur if</text>
  <text start="18.06" dur="5.52">you read Leviticus 23 you&amp;#39;ll see that</text>
  <text start="20.369" dur="5.82">yeah set down a pattern where you would</text>
  <text start="23.58" dur="5.369">have yom teruah the feast of blasting</text>
  <text start="26.189" dur="5.611">shouting trumpets we just had last week</text>
  <text start="28.949" dur="3.841">and then 10 days are between yom teruah</text>
  <text start="31.8" dur="3.81">and yom kippur</text>
  <text start="32.79" dur="6.24">we&amp;#39;re on day four so we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re almost</text>
  <text start="35.61" dur="6.359">halfway through now between yom teruah</text>
  <text start="39.03" dur="6.54">and yom kippur early yesterday on the</text>
  <text start="41.969" dur="4.471">Shabbat Saturday morning was about say 4</text>
  <text start="45.57" dur="4.68">o&amp;#39;clock in the morning</text>
  <text start="46.44" dur="5.849">yah awoke me and that&amp;#39;s very unusual for</text>
  <text start="50.25" dur="4.35">me because I have to wake up early off</text>
  <text start="52.289" dur="5.311">of the week for my regular job so on</text>
  <text start="54.6" dur="5.52">Shabbat I do like to sleep in but he</text>
  <text start="57.6" dur="4.65">woke me very early it was like 4 or 4:15</text>
  <text start="60.12" dur="5.039">in the morning and he he put a beautiful</text>
  <text start="62.25" dur="5.13">psalm on my heart Psalm 103 and and it</text>
  <text start="65.159" dur="6.351">was a beautiful time of just being with</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="7.169">him but he well let me qualify this I</text>
  <text start="71.51" dur="4.57">believe he downloaded this information</text>
  <text start="74.549" dur="3.841">into me but I have to be very careful</text>
  <text start="76.08" dur="3.929">because for those of you who know my</text>
  <text start="78.39" dur="5.19">ministry to our restoration ministries</text>
  <text start="80.009" dur="5.701">way back in 2010 I said you know that</text>
  <text start="83.58" dur="3.899">Yahshua is gonna return in 2017 and</text>
  <text start="85.71" dur="5.28">obviously I was completely wrong</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="6.481">ok and I I realized my error by by early</text>
  <text start="90.99" dur="4.769">2014 and repented for that so I want to</text>
  <text start="93.96" dur="4.019">be careful with this video um I believe</text>
  <text start="95.759" dur="4.831">this is stuff that yaws given me and</text>
  <text start="97.979" dur="6.121">he&amp;#39;s giving me some confirmations but we</text>
  <text start="100.59" dur="6.72">have to actually wait and see if what I</text>
  <text start="104.1" dur="6.6">have received is actually from yah or</text>
  <text start="107.31" dur="7.169">not so so I&amp;#39;m submitting this just</text>
  <text start="110.7" dur="6">because I want to see what you guys</text>
  <text start="114.479" dur="3.96">think and you know you pray about it and</text>
  <text start="116.7" dur="3.959">you seek yeah I&amp;#39;m gonna be putting some</text>
  <text start="118.439" dur="5.881">personal stuff in this as well</text>
  <text start="120.659" dur="6.81">so you know take her to leave it quite</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="4.529">honestly I don&amp;#39;t really I mean I would</text>
  <text start="127.469" dur="4.74">prefer yah should have returned much</text>
  <text start="128.849" dur="4.451">sooner than 10 years from now I want him</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="3.431">to return you know</text>
  <text start="133.3" dur="4.64">as soon as possible so you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="135.64" dur="4.8">really have a bias to be presenting this</text>
  <text start="137.94" dur="4.27">but it just seems to make sense with</text>
  <text start="140.44" dur="3.96">some of the things that ya shown me but</text>
  <text start="142.21" dur="3.84">but in any case this is not a thus</text>
  <text start="144.4" dur="3.33">sayeth yeah it&amp;#39;s just I&amp;#39;m putting this</text>
  <text start="146.05" dur="3.57">out here and you guys can pray about it</text>
  <text start="147.73" dur="4.38">and seek you out and see if if this</text>
  <text start="149.62" dur="4.56">bears witness with your spirit so in</text>
  <text start="152.11" dur="4.89">this first slide here I mean obviously</text>
  <text start="154.18" dur="4.2">you see this I don&amp;#39;t expect you to be</text>
  <text start="157" dur="3.21">able to look at all that I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="158.38" dur="3.24">showing that because that&amp;#39;s I have this</text>
  <text start="160.21" dur="4.35">whiteboard and that&amp;#39;s what I was putting</text>
  <text start="161.62" dur="4.98">up when I was praying to yawn and in the</text>
  <text start="164.56" dur="4.71">scripture and just sort of ruminating on</text>
  <text start="166.6" dur="5.43">all this and so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that first</text>
  <text start="169.27" dur="5.34">slide now the next slide what what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="172.03" dur="4.29">gonna do now is I&amp;#39;m gonna start putting</text>
  <text start="174.61" dur="3.66">up different parts of that whiteboard</text>
  <text start="176.32" dur="4.05">and enlarging them to make this much</text>
  <text start="178.27" dur="4.47">more clear so this first slide this</text>
  <text start="180.37" dur="5.43">actually came from you know I posted the</text>
  <text start="182.74" dur="5.73">this second set of the twelve messages</text>
  <text start="185.8" dur="5.67">to 144,000 back in the winter spring of</text>
  <text start="188.47" dur="4.95">this year and this was the 11th message</text>
  <text start="191.47" dur="3.51">and again I made it very clear that you</text>
  <text start="193.42" dur="3.78">know this is not of us say if yah it</text>
  <text start="194.98" dur="5.82">just seems to make sense and so what you</text>
  <text start="197.2" dur="5.91">see here is a menorah from July of 1914</text>
  <text start="200.8" dur="4.38">all the way until July of 2021 and it</text>
  <text start="203.11" dur="4.68">just it seems to make sense because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="205.18" dur="4.05">very symmetrical so you see if you start</text>
  <text start="207.79" dur="4.71">going from the left to the right of the</text>
  <text start="209.23" dur="5.34">menorah World War one was July of 1914</text>
  <text start="212.5" dur="3.66">and exactly three and a half years later</text>
  <text start="214.57" dur="4.83">you have the Balfour Declaration which</text>
  <text start="216.16" dur="5.28">was November of 1917 that was when the</text>
  <text start="219.4" dur="5.07">British Mandate for the first time took</text>
  <text start="221.44" dur="5.31">that land into Western hands from the</text>
  <text start="224.47" dur="3.69">Turks and the Ottomans and the the the</text>
  <text start="226.75" dur="3.209">Muslims that were out there so it was</text>
  <text start="228.16" dur="5.579">very significant that was a Jubilee year</text>
  <text start="229.959" dur="5.25">and then 30 years from there you come to</text>
  <text start="233.739" dur="3.301">the next stick in the menorah and that</text>
  <text start="235.209" dur="4.351">was the Israel decree in November of</text>
  <text start="237.04" dur="4.919">1947 this was when the UN actually did</text>
  <text start="239.56" dur="3.99">the partition - that would pave the way</text>
  <text start="241.959" dur="4.981">for Israel to become a nation which they</text>
  <text start="243.55" dur="5.4">officially did in the spring of 48 but</text>
  <text start="246.94" dur="2.34">it was November 47 when that decree was</text>
  <text start="248.95" dur="3.33">issued</text>
  <text start="249.28" dur="6.87">so exactly 30 30 years later from the</text>
  <text start="252.28" dur="6.81">Balfour Declaration exactly and then</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="4.41">another 20 years after that you come to</text>
  <text start="259.09" dur="4.92">the middle stick of the menorah which is</text>
  <text start="260.56" dur="4.89">June of 1967 another Jubilee year in</text>
  <text start="264.01" dur="2.1">which the Jews for the first time in</text>
  <text start="265.45" dur="3.42">1990</text>
  <text start="266.11" dur="5.64">took back the city of Jerusalem so you</text>
  <text start="268.87" dur="4.169">kind of have 50 years you know between</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="2.189">those two Jubilees on one side of the</text>
  <text start="273.039" dur="2.761">menorah and then you&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="273.939" dur="3">another 50 years on the other side of</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="3.149">the menorah actually didn&amp;#39;t write that</text>
  <text start="276.939" dur="3.75">down in the thing but there&amp;#39;s another 50</text>
  <text start="278.949" dur="3.78">year so it&amp;#39;s all symmetrical with these</text>
  <text start="280.689" dur="5.461">three and a half year periods on the</text>
  <text start="282.729" dur="7.74">sides the far left and right wings of</text>
  <text start="286.15" dur="6.359">menorah so so taking back Jerusalem as</text>
  <text start="290.469" dur="4.741">the centre menorah posts the servant</text>
  <text start="292.509" dur="4.981">candle and then you another 20 years and</text>
  <text start="295.21" dur="6.66">you come to the first major Intifada</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="7.41">which happened in December of 1987 this</text>
  <text start="301.87" dur="5.13">was the first ever that the Intifada</text>
  <text start="304.9" dur="4.44">that ever occurred where the</text>
  <text start="307" dur="4.74">Palestinians were staging this in Israel</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="5.039">that was December of 1987 was a huge</text>
  <text start="311.74" dur="4.229">deal back then and then you go out</text>
  <text start="314.379" dur="3.391">thirty years from there and you come to</text>
  <text start="315.969" dur="5.371">this year which is of course another</text>
  <text start="317.77" dur="5.85">Jubilee and I believe in order to match</text>
  <text start="321.34" dur="5.699">it up just like on the left side of the</text>
  <text start="323.62" dur="7.59">menorah you see that in November 1917</text>
  <text start="327.039" dur="6.84">Balfour Declaration and then and then</text>
  <text start="331.21" dur="4.41">you have November of 1947 the Israel</text>
  <text start="333.879" dur="4.141">decree well in the same way you match it</text>
  <text start="335.62" dur="4.889">up symmetrically over here</text>
  <text start="338.02" dur="5.549">mirror image so you have December 1987 I</text>
  <text start="340.509" dur="5.28">think it&amp;#39;d be December of 2017 possibly</text>
  <text start="343.569" dur="4.171">during Hanukkah this year because</text>
  <text start="345.789" dur="4.981">Hanukkah is all about rededicating the</text>
  <text start="347.74" dur="4.739">temple and cleansing your temple but I</text>
  <text start="350.77" dur="4.109">think the Temple Mount will be taken in</text>
  <text start="352.479" dur="5.16">December of 2017 so we&amp;#39;ll have to wait</text>
  <text start="354.879" dur="3.871">and see if that actually happens but if</text>
  <text start="357.639" dur="3.21">that does happen</text>
  <text start="358.75" dur="6.36">then I think that kind of kicks off the</text>
  <text start="360.849" dur="6.301">last decade the last 10 years what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="365.11" dur="4.14">gonna see here and then you go to a</text>
  <text start="367.15" dur="4.049">three and a half years after that - June</text>
  <text start="369.25" dur="3.36">July of 2021 you have World War three</text>
  <text start="371.199" dur="4.34">breaking out which is symmetrical with</text>
  <text start="372.61" dur="5.94">World War one back in July of 1914 so</text>
  <text start="375.539" dur="4.961">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that okay so that kind of</text>
  <text start="378.55" dur="3.81">sets this this is what I&amp;#39;ve gotten back</text>
  <text start="380.5" dur="4.71">in winter when I posted that message to</text>
  <text start="382.36" dur="4.559">learn for the 4,000 so you can take it</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="6.929">or leave it but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that now</text>
  <text start="386.919" dur="7.11">the next slide is in 2010 from the fall</text>
  <text start="392.139" dur="3.9">of 2010 to the fall of 2017 I think</text>
  <text start="394.029" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;ve had seven years of plenty in</text>
  <text start="396.039" dur="3.711">American what I mean by that is you know</text>
  <text start="397.959" dur="3.441">we had that housing crash in 2000</text>
  <text start="399.75" dur="4.11">and things were really bad for a lot of</text>
  <text start="401.4" dur="5.49">people but starting in about 2010 things</text>
  <text start="403.86" dur="5.28">started recovering and for the last</text>
  <text start="406.89" dur="4.2">seven years even though you know we</text>
  <text start="409.14" dur="3.57">still have had some struggles obviously</text>
  <text start="411.09" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s not been like the land of plenty</text>
  <text start="412.71" dur="3.21">back in the 80s and 90s it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="414.63" dur="4.68">relatively comfortable for most</text>
  <text start="415.92" dur="5.67">Americans these last seven years but now</text>
  <text start="419.31" dur="4.8">with the two eclipses the Eclipse that</text>
  <text start="421.59" dur="5.46">happened in August of 2017 and the</text>
  <text start="424.11" dur="4.29">Eclipse that happens in 2024 now we come</text>
  <text start="427.05" dur="3.99">to another seven-year period and I</text>
  <text start="428.4" dur="5.64">strongly believe that and the reason why</text>
  <text start="431.04" dur="6.06">it slashes an X across America the path</text>
  <text start="434.04" dur="4.59">of these two solar eclipses is that this</text>
  <text start="437.1" dur="3.54">marks out the last seven years for</text>
  <text start="438.63" dur="5.67">America to repent and to get right into</text>
  <text start="440.64" dur="5.85">to prepare themselves so we had seven</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="3.84">years of plenty from 2010 to the Jubilee</text>
  <text start="446.49" dur="3.9">of 2017 and now we&amp;#39;re about to enter</text>
  <text start="448.14" dur="4.17">into these last seven years actually you</text>
  <text start="450.39" dur="4.2">sorta we have with that Eclipse in</text>
  <text start="452.31" dur="3.6">August and we&amp;#39;ve seen just since that</text>
  <text start="454.59" dur="2.61">eclipse has happened these major</text>
  <text start="455.91" dur="4.44">devastating things that have happened</text>
  <text start="457.2" dur="4.98">like the two hurricanes devastated Texas</text>
  <text start="460.35" dur="3.66">and Florida like these massive</text>
  <text start="462.18" dur="3.54">earthquakes down in Mexico like the</text>
  <text start="464.01" dur="3.72">fires in the West you know and yeah I</text>
  <text start="465.72" dur="4.65">was really trying to bring this nation</text>
  <text start="467.73" dur="5.46">to or as many people as will to repent</text>
  <text start="470.37" dur="5.21">to turn to him so I think we have the</text>
  <text start="473.19" dur="7.47">last seven years of America from 217</text>
  <text start="475.58" dur="10.45">2017 to 2024 demarcated by these total</text>
  <text start="480.66" dur="7.89">solar eclipses so now this next one is</text>
  <text start="486.03" dur="4.41">Jacob&amp;#39;s trouble seven years and and I</text>
  <text start="488.55" dur="3.51">know that really if you had a revelation</text>
  <text start="490.44" dur="4.8">it talks about a three and a half year</text>
  <text start="492.06" dur="5.669">Great Tribulation Period but I think</text>
  <text start="495.24" dur="5.31">there is this seven year period this</text>
  <text start="497.729" dur="8.851">week and I think it fault starts in the</text>
  <text start="500.55" dur="9.21">fall of 2020 and this slide here I think</text>
  <text start="506.58" dur="6.99">there could be a brokered peace somehow</text>
  <text start="509.76" dur="5.519">in the middle east in the fall of 2020</text>
  <text start="513.57" dur="3.449">and because you know there&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="515.279" dur="4.05">lot of turmoil if this temple actually</text>
  <text start="517.019" dur="3.51">does get put up late this year in</text>
  <text start="519.329" dur="2.4">December 2017</text>
  <text start="520.529" dur="3.271">there&amp;#39;s give me a lot of turmoil that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="521.729" dur="4.141">gonna go on and there&amp;#39;s gonna be a lot</text>
  <text start="523.8" dur="5.339">of unrest and so someone&amp;#39;s gonna have to</text>
  <text start="525.87" dur="5.159">you know calm things down so if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="529.139" dur="3.901">a brokered peace in the fall of 2020</text>
  <text start="531.029" dur="4.711">I think that&amp;#39;ll directly lead to that</text>
  <text start="533.04" dur="5.31">World War 3 in summer of 2021 because</text>
  <text start="535.74" dur="6.029">you know whatever type of peace they</text>
  <text start="538.35" dur="5.789">they try it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not gonna stand fast</text>
  <text start="541.769" dur="4.731">which I think we&amp;#39;re gonna see a huge war</text>
  <text start="544.139" dur="4.56">in the summer of 2021</text>
  <text start="546.5" dur="5.949">there&amp;#39;s always cause and effect in</text>
  <text start="548.699" dur="7.051">history so I think that&amp;#39;s important but</text>
  <text start="552.449" dur="5.041">this next slide again shows this time of</text>
  <text start="555.75" dur="4.47">Jacob&amp;#39;s trouble seven years from the</text>
  <text start="557.49" dur="4.829">fall of 2020 to the fall of 2027 you see</text>
  <text start="560.22" dur="4.08">World War 3 breaking out in the summer</text>
  <text start="562.319" dur="6.841">of 2021 which was connected to that</text>
  <text start="564.3" dur="8.219">menorah and it&amp;#39;s gonna be a bad war but</text>
  <text start="569.16" dur="5.609">Israel&amp;#39;s gonna emerge victorious</text>
  <text start="572.519" dur="4.05">America will emerge emerge victorious</text>
  <text start="574.769" dur="5.461">and it&amp;#39;s gonna be sort of a golden age</text>
  <text start="576.569" dur="6.27">for Israel you know going forth and that</text>
  <text start="580.23" dur="6.12">temples gonna continue on but I do</text>
  <text start="582.839" dur="6.451">believe that by 2024 you know that that</text>
  <text start="586.35" dur="5.19">last Eclipse that demarks case the last</text>
  <text start="589.29" dur="5.64">seven years of America happens in April</text>
  <text start="591.54" dur="5.43">2024 right around the hebrew new year in</text>
  <text start="594.93" dur="3.69">fact I might even by Passover and I</text>
  <text start="596.97" dur="3.21">think that&amp;#39;s when that last seven years</text>
  <text start="598.62" dur="3.209">of America comes to an end and you have</text>
  <text start="600.18" dur="4.23">the abomination of desolation as</text>
  <text start="601.829" dur="4.711">described in the gospel account and in</text>
  <text start="604.41" dur="4.08">Revelation I think it&amp;#39;s gonna be late</text>
  <text start="606.54" dur="3.599">winter early spring maybe around Purim</text>
  <text start="608.49" dur="3.48">but maybe as late as April but in any</text>
  <text start="610.139" dur="3.93">case that abomination of desolation in</text>
  <text start="611.97" dur="4.469">which that three and a half year Great</text>
  <text start="614.069" dur="8.041">Tribulation Period is gonna begin in the</text>
  <text start="616.439" dur="6.84">spring of of 2024 and it has to begin no</text>
  <text start="622.11" dur="3.39">matter when the Great Tribulation begins</text>
  <text start="623.279" dur="3.93">it has to begin in the spring during or</text>
  <text start="625.5" dur="4.079">around the spring feasts or just before</text>
  <text start="627.209" dur="4.081">because that&amp;#39;s how Yahshua returns in</text>
  <text start="629.579" dur="4.56">the fall feasts three and a half years</text>
  <text start="631.29" dur="4.83">later so it always has to start in the</text>
  <text start="634.139" dur="4.711">spring whatever year so I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="636.12" dur="4.829">gonna be 2024 the last seven years of</text>
  <text start="638.85" dur="3.719">America will end and you&amp;#39;ll have that</text>
  <text start="640.949" dur="2.061">abomination of desolation and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="642.569" dur="4.371">have the</text>
  <text start="643.01" dur="8.129">than Great Tribulation Period and then</text>
  <text start="646.94" dur="6.3">you get to the fall of 2027 and I put it</text>
  <text start="651.139" dur="5.01">teaching up about this on young ribbet</text>
  <text start="653.24" dur="5">in Revelation 10 7 you read about the</text>
  <text start="656.149" dur="4.411">days of the seventh trumpet being blown</text>
  <text start="658.24" dur="5.709">and the reason we don&amp;#39;t know the day or</text>
  <text start="660.56" dur="5.49">the hour is because no Yom Truitt is the</text>
  <text start="663.949" dur="4.471">day of the trumpet blast of shouting of</text>
  <text start="666.05" dur="5.07">Feast of Trumpets but there&amp;#39;s 10 days</text>
  <text start="668.42" dur="5.039">between yom teruah Kippur so I believe</text>
  <text start="671.12" dur="4.469">sometime during those 10 days when the</text>
  <text start="673.459" dur="4.351">seventh angel begins to blow and sound</text>
  <text start="675.589" dur="4.261">you&amp;#39;re gonna have the resurrection of</text>
  <text start="677.81" dur="3.42">the just or the dead Messiah rise first</text>
  <text start="679.85" dur="2.94">and then we are alive and remain get</text>
  <text start="681.23" dur="3.24">caught up to be with him but you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="682.79" dur="4.349">know the day or the hour because it can</text>
  <text start="684.47" dur="6.03">be any time between yom teruah 20:27 and</text>
  <text start="687.139" dur="6.781">yom kippur 20:27 so you don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="690.5" dur="7.29">day or the hour now this is a more</text>
  <text start="693.92" dur="7.26">personal thing my dad was born in 1948</text>
  <text start="697.79" dur="6.599">the year that Israel was became a nation</text>
  <text start="701.18" dur="5.43">and I his son you know if this is</text>
  <text start="704.389" dur="5.31">correct if Yahshua does return in the</text>
  <text start="706.61" dur="5.61">fall of 2027 I will be 48 when Yahshua</text>
  <text start="709.699" dur="4.111">returned I thought was kind of cool but</text>
  <text start="712.22" dur="5.04">like I said we&amp;#39;ll have to see if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="713.81" dur="5.91">actually true and then this is another</text>
  <text start="717.26" dur="4.559">personal thing I just thought I&amp;#39;d share</text>
  <text start="719.72" dur="5.849">in my own personal life when I was a</text>
  <text start="721.819" dur="5.7">young man between the years of 1996 1988</text>
  <text start="725.569" dur="4.441">this was the year I was finishing up</text>
  <text start="727.519" dur="5.94">high school and heading into college and</text>
  <text start="730.01" dur="5.73">in 96 there was sort of this restoration</text>
  <text start="733.459" dur="4.411">this call back where I really felt a</text>
  <text start="735.74" dur="4.529">pool by the spirit to really start</text>
  <text start="737.87" dur="7.05">taking Christianity seriously because</text>
  <text start="740.269" dur="6.69">I&amp;#39;ve been raised in it and in 97</text>
  <text start="744.92" dur="3.479">there was this fiery Evangelist that</text>
  <text start="746.959" dur="2.911">came to our church down in Texas and</text>
  <text start="748.399" dur="3.87">there was a call to repentance and</text>
  <text start="749.87" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s actually the year I got I got</text>
  <text start="752.269" dur="3.991">converted I gave my heart to Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="754.16" dur="3.39">then in 98 there was a great change</text>
  <text start="756.26" dur="2.97">that&amp;#39;s when I actually moved from Texas</text>
  <text start="757.55" dur="2.969">to Oregon and I went to school and it</text>
  <text start="759.23" dur="2.549">was a huge change in my life</text>
  <text start="760.519" dur="3.331">well I&amp;#39;ll kind of show me that this</text>
  <text start="761.779" dur="4.17">pattern is following in my life now in</text>
  <text start="763.85" dur="3.479">2016 there was a call back because I</text>
  <text start="765.949" dur="3.211">started doing Street preaching again</text>
  <text start="767.329" dur="3.75">which I hadn&amp;#39;t done in a number of years</text>
  <text start="769.16" dur="5.429">and just sort of returning to a lot of</text>
  <text start="771.079" dur="5.19">the simplicity of the faith that I think</text>
  <text start="774.589" dur="2.711">I had sort of forgotten you know getting</text>
  <text start="776.269" dur="3.581">so into Taurus</text>
  <text start="777.3" dur="5.37">times you forget that simplicity of your</text>
  <text start="779.85" dur="4.26">faith in Messiah and then 2017 has been</text>
  <text start="782.67" dur="4.53">in sort of another repentance here</text>
  <text start="784.11" dur="5.52">because you know I shared that I had</text>
  <text start="787.2" dur="5.49">sort of lost my first love and a grown</text>
  <text start="789.63" dur="5.399">sleepy and I had had and yah had to sort</text>
  <text start="792.69" dur="4.53">of wake me up so this does happen in</text>
  <text start="795.029" dur="4.471">2017 and so next year I expect there to</text>
  <text start="797.22" dur="5.94">be another great change in my life we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="799.5" dur="5.279">see what happens but so that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="803.16" dur="6.72">wanted to share I&amp;#39;ll put this other</text>
  <text start="804.779" dur="7.201">slide back up of everything again again</text>
  <text start="809.88" dur="4.199">it remains to be seen is is this truly</text>
  <text start="811.98" dur="5.46">what&amp;#39;s gonna happen is this the final</text>
  <text start="814.079" dur="5.521">decade well if it is it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="817.44" dur="5.519">exciting because you know in James and</text>
  <text start="819.6" dur="5.31">in 2nd Peter we read about yah being</text>
  <text start="822.959" dur="4.201">this patient husband then waiting for</text>
  <text start="824.91" dur="5.85">the fruit of the earth to ripen and so</text>
  <text start="827.16" dur="5.13">it does give us more time to win the</text>
  <text start="830.76" dur="3.78">lost and that&amp;#39;s what he wants he wants</text>
  <text start="832.29" dur="5.25">as many people as possible to repent he</text>
  <text start="834.54" dur="4.7">really does and I found this new</text>
  <text start="837.54" dur="4.62">congregation down in Salem Oregon</text>
  <text start="839.24" dur="4.589">cornerstone and I really am praying and</text>
  <text start="842.16" dur="3.929">hoping a revival starts there because</text>
  <text start="843.829" dur="5.081">you know the Pacific Northwest has never</text>
  <text start="846.089" dur="4.5">seen a revival at least historically</text>
  <text start="848.91" dur="3.66">yeah you got the Azusa Street revival</text>
  <text start="850.589" dur="3">that happened in the nineteen nineteen</text>
  <text start="852.57" dur="3.3">hundred&amp;#39;s down in Southern California</text>
  <text start="853.589" dur="4.44">and you&amp;#39;ve got the Second Great</text>
  <text start="855.87" dur="4.589">Awakening which happened in the early to</text>
  <text start="858.029" dur="5.191">mid 1800s in on the eastern seaboard in</text>
  <text start="860.459" dur="4.291">Northeast New England you have almost</text>
  <text start="863.22" dur="3.359">every major section of the United States</text>
  <text start="864.75" dur="4.709">has had a revival except the Pacific</text>
  <text start="866.579" dur="4.621">Northwest and so it&amp;#39;d be neat if this</text>
  <text start="869.459" dur="3.421">timeline is true and so we have more</text>
  <text start="871.2" dur="3.21">time for this revival to actually happen</text>
  <text start="872.88" dur="2.19">to bring in a harvest at least here in</text>
  <text start="874.41" dur="4.369">the northwest</text>
  <text start="875.07" dur="6.6">before before everything crumbles but</text>
  <text start="878.779" dur="6.401">but in any case if we truly have entered</text>
  <text start="881.67" dur="5.609">the final seven years of America and the</text>
  <text start="885.18" dur="3.57">final seven years before we get to that</text>
  <text start="887.279" dur="3.721">three and a half year Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="888.75" dur="4.949">we should be sober and we should really</text>
  <text start="891" dur="4.56">be seeking yawn asking him to help us do</text>
  <text start="893.699" dur="3.061">exactly what he wants us to do to reach</text>
  <text start="895.56" dur="5.82">as many people as possible in this</text>
  <text start="896.76" dur="7.05">nation because once 2024 gets here seven</text>
  <text start="901.38" dur="5.699">years from now and we get to that spring</text>
  <text start="903.81" dur="5.68">time you know that Great Tribulation I</text>
  <text start="907.079" dur="4.581">mean that&amp;#39;s when no man will work</text>
  <text start="909.49" dur="3.64">except that when we testify we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="911.66" dur="4.35">get killed or we&amp;#39;ll be in a safe place</text>
  <text start="913.13" dur="5.34">but by 2024 I mean if that&amp;#39;s if this</text>
  <text start="916.01" dur="4.08">really is gonna go down then we better</text>
  <text start="918.47" dur="5.49">we better do all we can to serve you out</text>
  <text start="920.09" dur="8.16">now is what I&amp;#39;m trying to say so</text>
  <text start="923.96" dur="6.48">I submit this to you guys pray pray</text>
  <text start="928.25" dur="3.36">about it take it the out or maybe you</text>
  <text start="930.44" dur="2.73">don&amp;#39;t even want to watch this cuz it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="931.61" dur="3.36">like okay another guy just coming up</text>
  <text start="933.17" dur="3">with and I had wrestled with y&amp;#39;all about</text>
  <text start="934.97" dur="2.43">posting this because there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="936.17" dur="3.24">people out there that have all these</text>
  <text start="937.4" dur="4.41">time lanes and these theories and all</text>
  <text start="939.41" dur="4.23">this stuff and it&amp;#39;s like how is this</text>
  <text start="941.81" dur="4.5">edifying the body how is this bringing</text>
  <text start="943.64" dur="5.46">people to you so I will say my only</text>
  <text start="946.31" dur="5.4">motive for sharing this is is I do want</text>
  <text start="949.1" dur="4.83">the body Messiah to be walking in the</text>
  <text start="951.71" dur="3.63">fullness of the Spirit obeying the</text>
  <text start="953.93" dur="3.96">fullness of his tour as much as it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="955.34" dur="4.2">possible I want hypocrites to repent I</text>
  <text start="957.89" dur="3.66">want sinners to find their salvation</text>
  <text start="959.54" dur="3.81">Yahshua and start growing in his word</text>
  <text start="961.55" dur="5.01">through his spirit covered by his what I</text>
  <text start="963.35" dur="5.49">want this and so if anything this</text>
  <text start="966.56" dur="5.34">timeline I hope will just maybe just</text>
  <text start="968.84" dur="6.12">urge you if this is true what should I</text>
  <text start="971.9" dur="4.89">be doing now to get ready and actually</text>
  <text start="974.96" dur="4.38">that should be your heart anyway right</text>
  <text start="976.79" dur="4.68">we should always be expecting Yahshua to</text>
  <text start="979.34" dur="4.62">return and to keep our garments spotless</text>
  <text start="981.47" dur="4.89">and clean and to be walking soberly and</text>
  <text start="983.96" dur="5.04">righteously and redeeming the time you</text>
  <text start="986.36" dur="4.92">know because the days are evil even</text>
  <text start="989" dur="4.26">2,000 years ago the disciples many of</text>
  <text start="991.28" dur="4.02">them were convinced this is the end time</text>
  <text start="993.26" dur="3.93">I think Paul even thought so for a while</text>
  <text start="995.3" dur="3.48">and then of course he realized right</text>
  <text start="997.19" dur="4.17">before he got killed that it was gonna</text>
  <text start="998.78" dur="4.5">not not right then but you know I think</text>
  <text start="1001.36" dur="3.45">in every age all the Saints have lived</text>
  <text start="1003.28" dur="3.21">like that and it&amp;#39;s a healthy way to live</text>
  <text start="1004.81" dur="3.78">we should be living as if Messiah is</text>
  <text start="1006.49" dur="4.95">about to return because he told us to be</text>
  <text start="1008.59" dur="4.92">sober to watch to guard our hearts not</text>
  <text start="1011.44" dur="4.26">to grow lazy not to fall asleep not to</text>
  <text start="1013.51" dur="3.81">start getting off into bad attitudes and</text>
  <text start="1015.7" dur="3.3">meeting our fellow servants and then</text>
  <text start="1017.32" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re not ready when he returns not to</text>
  <text start="1019" dur="3.99">be like those five foolish virgins who</text>
  <text start="1021.22" dur="5.88">didn&amp;#39;t take that oil didn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="1022.99" dur="6.69">spirit wasn&amp;#39;t walking in the word so if</text>
