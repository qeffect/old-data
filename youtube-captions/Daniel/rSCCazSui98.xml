  <text start="232.99" dur="7.86">prophesied this and it&amp;#39;s going to come</text>
  <text start="234.58" dur="9.51">to pass and I believe it&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>
  <text start="240.85" dur="5.64">here now Mystery Babylon you read about</text>
  <text start="244.09" dur="4.41">Babylon and revelation 18 and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="246.49" dur="3.84">different layers to Mystery Babylon</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="4.23">whenever you read the Hebrew Scriptures</text>
  <text start="250.33" dur="5.82">always understand there are multiple</text>
  <text start="252.73" dur="5.16">layers so the USA is a type of Mystery</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="3.66">Babylon it&amp;#39;s not the ultimate one it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="257.89" dur="4.44">type just like Rome was just like a lot</text>
  <text start="259.81" dur="5.25">of the previous empires work the USA is</text>
  <text start="262.33" dur="4.98">a type and it will be destroyed it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="265.06" dur="3.6">taken down it&amp;#39;ll look like Armageddon</text>
  <text start="267.31" dur="3.359">but it won&amp;#39;t be it&amp;#39;ll to be the</text>
  <text start="268.66" dur="5.46">beginning of Armageddon the beginning of</text>
  <text start="270.669" dur="5.521">the three and a half years so the USA&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.12" dur="3.75">destroyed and out of the ashes of that</text>
  <text start="276.19" dur="4.89">nuke of the war the son of perdition</text>
  <text start="277.87" dur="5.76">arises and so the USA is the global</text>
  <text start="281.08" dur="4.26">superpower of the world but once they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.63" dur="3.66">destroyed that&amp;#39;s going to transfer to</text>
  <text start="285.34" dur="4.62">Israel and Israel will become the global</text>
  <text start="287.29" dur="4.53">superpower of the world so we have a</text>
  <text start="289.96" dur="4.86">three and a half year period between the</text>
  <text start="291.82" dur="7.83">spring feasts of 2024 and the fall</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="6.12">feasts of 2027 three and a half years</text>

  <text start="313.69" dur="4.11">see seven years in Revelation show me</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="3.63">one verse in Revelation where says seven</text>
  <text start="317.8" dur="4.41">years you won&amp;#39;t find it because there</text>
  <text start="319.81" dur="3.66">are seven years in Daniel Messiah is cut</text>
  <text start="322.21" dur="2.64">off in the midst so you Messiah</text>
  <text start="323.47" dur="3.09">fulfilled that first three and a half</text>
  <text start="324.85" dur="3.03">years in the Gospels and then you have</text>
  <text start="326.56" dur="2.64">the remaining three and a half years</text>
  <text start="327.88" dur="3.39">well you&amp;#39;re gonna have a counterfeit</text>
  <text start="329.2" dur="3.93">Messiah it was also going to do signs</text>

  <text start="334.169" dur="6.271">quote-unquote ministry on earth so</text>
  <text start="340.8" dur="5.77">Mystery Babylon the USA is destroyed and</text>
  <text start="343.539" dur="5.31">the ultimate Mystery Babylon that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.57" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s the ultimate fulfillment of it</text>
  <text start="348.849" dur="4.04">it&amp;#39;s going to happen as Israel is a</text>
  <text start="350.83" dur="6.03">global superpower over the entire world</text>
  <text start="352.889" dur="5.11">and that ultimate one will be destroyed</text>
  <text start="356.86" dur="3.029">here the Sun apparition will be</text>
  <text start="357.999" dur="3.81">destroyed here and then Israel will get</text>
  <text start="359.889" dur="3.84">taken over by the true Messiah the</text>
  <text start="361.809" dur="4.26">carpenter from Nazareth Yahshua who will</text>
  <text start="363.729" dur="5.93">return and power and glory from the sky</text>

  <text start="370.05" dur="7.569">okay so type of Mystery Babylon</text>
  <text start="375.999" dur="2.521">destroyed here and that&amp;#39;s why some</text>
  <text start="377.619" dur="3.39">people are gonna be deceived because</text>
  <text start="378.52" dur="3.509">once this nuclear war happens in the USA</text>
  <text start="381.009" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s traitors gonna say well that was</text>
  <text start="382.029" dur="4.92">Armageddon now it&amp;#39;s time for Messiah but</text>
  <text start="385.479" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s actually going to be a setup for</text>
  <text start="386.949" dur="8.4">the son of perdition and then the</text>
  <text start="389.319" dur="7.83">ultimate Babylon is destroyed here the</text>
  <text start="395.349" dur="3.3">spirit of Babylon will be in Israel</text>
  <text start="397.149" dur="3.99">Israel will be the superpower of the</text>
  <text start="398.649" dur="5.61">world at that point the son of perdition</text>
  <text start="401.139" dur="7.02">will be a counterfeit Messiah and there</text>
  <text start="404.259" dur="5.64">will be ten Kings beneath Israel at that</text>
  <text start="408.159" dur="5.37">point that will be ruling the world</text>
  <text start="409.899" dur="6.39">and the Sanhedrin which was formed in</text>
  <text start="413.529" dur="4.38">2008 they will be a congress for the</text>
  <text start="416.289" dur="3.75">world and they will enforce the Noahide</text>
  <text start="417.909" dur="4.92">laws which are very wicked wicked laws</text>
  <text start="420.039" dur="5.28">and according to Talmud and the Zohar</text>
  <text start="422.829" dur="4.44">the penalty for breaking a no high law</text>
  <text start="425.319" dur="6.81">is to have your head cut off the</text>
  <text start="427.269" dur="6.721">guillotines will be used so this is the</text>
  <text start="432.129" dur="4.64">Great Tribulation Period now during this</text>
  <text start="433.99" dur="5.219">period we see a lot of things happening</text>
  <text start="436.769" dur="4.51">the first thing we see is the two</text>
  <text start="439.209" dur="5.96">witnesses let&amp;#39;s talked about in</text>
  <text start="441.279" dur="7.26">Revelation 11 these are two literal men</text>
  <text start="445.169" dur="7.17">they can they&amp;#39;re invincible for 1260</text>
  <text start="448.539" dur="7.11">days basically they&amp;#39;ll begin their</text>
  <text start="452.339" dur="5.651">testimony on lamb day Aviv ten which is</text>
  <text start="455.649" dur="4.83">four days before Passover and then</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="4.679">exactly 1260 days after that is yom</text>
  <text start="460.479" dur="3.48">teruah a piece of trumpets and that</text>
  <text start="462.669" dur="4.11">happens by the way that three and a</text>
  <text start="463.959" dur="5.64">period is embedded in every single every</text>
  <text start="466.779" dur="5.31">single time because one of these days on</text>
  <text start="469.599" dur="4.05">some future lamb day which is the day</text>
  <text start="472.089" dur="4.56">that the lands are selected four days</text>
  <text start="473.649" dur="4.651">before Passover every year one of these</text>
  <text start="476.649" dur="3.54">future land days those two witnesses</text>
  <text start="478.3" dur="3.209">will begin their testimony and it will</text>
  <text start="480.189" dur="1.711">go all the way to home true when their</text>
  <text start="481.509" dur="2.041">reservoir</text>
  <text start="481.9" dur="3.15">that along with the all the other dead</text>
  <text start="483.55" dur="4.47">Messiah and those of us who are alive</text>
  <text start="485.05" dur="6.48">and remain so they&amp;#39;ll begin their their</text>
  <text start="488.02" dur="5.22">testimony lamb day 2024 going all the</text>
  <text start="491.53" dur="4.02">way until they are slaughtered on the</text>
  <text start="493.24" dur="4.709">streets of Jerusalem where they lay dead</text>
  <text start="495.55" dur="4.11">for three and a half days missus could</text>
  <text start="497.949" dur="4.44">all be read about in Revelation eleven</text>
  <text start="499.66" dur="4.17">and then in Revelation 11:11 a lot of</text>
  <text start="502.389" dur="3.361">you wonder what eleven eleven means</text>
  <text start="503.83" dur="4.02">revelation eleven eleven that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="505.75" dur="4.5">they get resurrected the dead Messiah</text>
  <text start="507.85" dur="4.02">rise and that&amp;#39;ll happen on the Feast of</text>
  <text start="510.25" dur="4.05">Trumpets the days of the seventh Trump</text>
  <text start="511.87" dur="4.589">here and again the reason we can&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="514.3" dur="5.52">that they&amp;#39;re the hour is because yom</text>
  <text start="516.459" dur="5.731">teruah you have yom teruah and then ten</text>
  <text start="519.82" dur="5.49">days later you have yom kippur so during</text>
  <text start="522.19" dur="5.13">those ten days every year it&amp;#39;s the days</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="3.5">of the seventh trumpet it&amp;#39;s the days of</text>
  <text start="527.32" dur="3.48">yom teruah</text>
  <text start="528.81" dur="3.58">so you don&amp;#39;t know the day or the hour</text>
  <text start="530.8" dur="2.85">you can know the year but you will never</text>
  <text start="532.39" dur="3.11">know that they&amp;#39;re the hour it can happen</text>
  <text start="533.65" dur="4.77">anytime during that period so sometime</text>
  <text start="535.5" dur="5.8">during Feast of Trumpets and Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="538.42" dur="7.5">you have that resurrection that occurs</text>
  <text start="541.3" dur="6.12">so who are these two witnesses so the</text>
  <text start="545.92" dur="3.81">scripture says is appointed unto man</text>
  <text start="547.42" dur="4.32">once to die and then the judgment that</text>
  <text start="549.73" dur="3.479">means every man will die except for</text>
  <text start="551.74" dur="3.39">those for our live and remain at his</text>
  <text start="553.209" dur="3.361">coming that&amp;#39;s again why it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="555.13" dur="2.85">important to grab a hold that</text>
  <text start="556.57" dur="2.76">Philadelphian promise so we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="557.98" dur="5.22">get into Philadelphia a little bit later</text>
  <text start="559.33" dur="5.75">in this video but these two witnesses</text>
  <text start="563.2" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re also appointed to die they</text>
  <text start="565.08" dur="4.449">preach for three and a half years no one</text>
  <text start="567.76" dur="4.019">can touch them they&amp;#39;re able to oppose</text>
  <text start="569.529" dur="4.861">what the son of perdition is doing and</text>
  <text start="571.779" dur="3.75">it says that because the people fall so</text>
  <text start="574.39" dur="2.85">in love with the son of perdition</text>
  <text start="575.529" dur="3.481">they&amp;#39;re so amazed by him that they hate</text>
  <text start="577.24" dur="4.89">these two witnesses they try to kill</text>
  <text start="579.01" dur="4.44">them but they can&amp;#39;t in fact in whatever</text>
  <text start="582.13" dur="2.55">manner they try to kill them those</text>
  <text start="583.45" dur="3.3">people get killed so these two witnesses</text>
  <text start="584.68" dur="5.61">are like invincible up until the Beast</text>
  <text start="586.75" dur="7.17">is able to finally murder them in the</text>
  <text start="590.29" dur="6.239">streets of Jerusalem so who are these</text>
  <text start="593.92" dur="4.77">two guys so a lot of people say Elijah</text>
  <text start="596.529" dur="5.281">guys Elijah and I have a whole teaching</text>
  <text start="598.69" dur="5.37">on this that I can post Elijah did die</text>
  <text start="601.81" dur="3.779">when he was caught up in that chariot he</text>
  <text start="604.06" dur="3.27">did not go to heaven he went from one</text>
  <text start="605.589" dur="3.721">point of Israel to another point of</text>
  <text start="607.33" dur="4.29">Israel and I can prove that because five</text>
  <text start="609.31" dur="3.54">years after that incident happened when</text>
  <text start="611.62" dur="4.05">he was caught up in the chariot of fire</text>
  <text start="612.85" dur="5.04">he writes a letter to a king in Israel</text>

  <text start="674.95" dur="3.72">rumor went abroad that John would be</text>
  <text start="677.2" dur="3.87">here when the Messiah returns and it</text>
  <text start="678.67" dur="5.07">even says when Jesus is preaching</text>

  <text start="736.18" dur="2.31">extremely vigilant when they exiled</text>
  <text start="737.89" dur="2.22">someone you</text>
  <text start="738.49" dur="3.12">not getting off that Ireland you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="740.11" dur="5.31">gonna be able to send messengers up how</text>
  <text start="741.61" dur="5.88">did that happen so John that there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="745.42" dur="4.8">tomb for John there&amp;#39;s no record of his</text>
  <text start="747.49" dur="5.73">passing the record of his death it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="750.22" dur="5.25">there and then revelation 10 the Holy</text>
  <text start="753.22" dur="4.619">Spirit specifically tells John you will</text>
  <text start="755.47" dur="4.98">yet stand before kings and princes and</text>
  <text start="757.839" dur="4.44">rulers and prophesy to them well how he</text>
  <text start="760.45" dur="3.54">was an old man at that point when he</text>
  <text start="762.279" dur="4.441">received the scroll of Revelation that</text>
  <text start="763.99" dur="5.13">revelation all that he never prophesied</text>
  <text start="766.72" dur="8.809">before kings and nations and he never</text>
  <text start="769.12" dur="10.14">did that ever but he will Apostle John</text>
  <text start="775.529" dur="5.591">the one disciple whom Yahshua says whom</text>
  <text start="779.26" dur="5.85">Yahshua loved you this disciple always</text>
  <text start="781.12" dur="4.589">had his head on on Yahshua&amp;#39;s chest so</text>
  <text start="785.11" dur="2.88">john</text>
  <text start="785.709" dur="4.591">enoch they never died and they are</text>
  <text start="787.99" dur="2.94">appointed to die they will be the two</text>
  <text start="790.3" dur="2.99">witnesses</text>
  <text start="790.93" dur="4.44">we got Enoch of the Tanakh the</text>
  <text start="793.29" dur="4.27">quote-unquote Old Testament we got John</text>
  <text start="795.37" dur="4.08">of the New Testament we got the Torah</text>
  <text start="797.56" dur="5.46">and the spirit we got it all here these</text>
  <text start="799.45" dur="6.75">two men and I know it&amp;#39;s hard to believe</text>
  <text start="803.02" dur="4.8">guys but John he&amp;#39;s still around I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="806.2" dur="5.449">know where but he&amp;#39;s still around</text>
  <text start="807.82" dur="6.42">and Enoch will be we&amp;#39;ll be back here too</text>
  <text start="811.649" dur="4.301">so these are the two witnesses Imai</text>
  <text start="814.24" dur="6.27">believe and I think it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="815.95" dur="9.18">substantiative by scripture and so they</text>
  <text start="820.51" dur="6.329">will preach for that 1260 days and they</text>
  <text start="825.13" dur="3.54">will be murdered three and a half days</text>
  <text start="826.839" dur="4.321">prior to the days of yom teruah</text>
  <text start="828.67" dur="4.109">and then they&amp;#39;ll be resurrected along</text>
  <text start="831.16" dur="4.28">with the dead and messiah and those of</text>
  <text start="832.779" dur="6.451">us who are alive and remain will also be</text>
  <text start="835.44" dur="5.83">will also be resurrected so that happens</text>
  <text start="839.23" dur="3.27">that resurrection what the Christians</text>
  <text start="841.27" dur="3.29">called the rapture it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="842.5" dur="4.56">resurrection it&amp;#39;s a very public event</text>
  <text start="844.56" dur="3.969">that happens at the seventh trumpet in</text>
  <text start="847.06" dur="3.21">the book of Revelation is the seventh</text>
  <text start="848.529" dur="4.261">trumpet resurrection and is talked about</text>
  <text start="850.27" dur="3.96">in Daniel 12 is talked about in the</text>
  <text start="852.79" dur="3.45">Torah is talked about in the Book of</text>
  <text start="854.23" dur="4.669">Psalms is talked about in 1st</text>
  <text start="856.24" dur="5.52">Thessalonians 4 in 1st Corinthians 15</text>

  <text start="871.98" dur="11.19">end so let&amp;#39;s talk about Philadelphia</text>
  <text start="881" dur="4.96">because during this three 1/2 year</text>
  <text start="883.17" dur="4.98">period it says that the dragon is going</text>
  <text start="885.96" dur="3.48">to persecute the Saints of the Most High</text>
  <text start="888.15" dur="2.91">who are keeping his Commandments he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="889.44" dur="3.57">going to persecute them they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="891.06" dur="3.33">get beheaded and he&amp;#39;ll prevail over the</text>
  <text start="893.01" dur="5.99">Saints during this three and a half year</text>
  <text start="894.39" dur="7.77">period but Yahshua said in Luke 21 pray</text>
  <text start="899" dur="4.69">pray that you&amp;#39;re accounted worthy to</text>
  <text start="902.16" dur="3.39">escape all these things and to stand</text>
  <text start="903.69" dur="6.21">before the Son of man in Revelation 3 it</text>
  <text start="905.55" dur="6.87">says the Assembly of Philadelphia will</text>
  <text start="909.9" dur="4.7">escape the hour of temptation and in</text>
  <text start="912.42" dur="5.52">Revelation 12 we read about this woman</text>
  <text start="914.6" dur="5.05">that right at the beginning of this 1260</text>
  <text start="917.94" dur="3.99">day period the same period that the</text>
  <text start="919.65" dur="4.26">Antichrist rules the same period that</text>
  <text start="921.93" dur="4.68">the two witnesses preach this same</text>

  <text start="931.11" dur="5.46">to get to them the dragon can&amp;#39;t she</text>
  <text start="934.02" dur="4.44">escapes on wings of an eagle just like</text>
  <text start="936.57" dur="2.94">it says I bore the children of Israel on</text>
  <text start="938.46" dur="3.66">wings of eagles</text>

  <text start="1485.98" dur="2.97">rebellion is getting very short-lived</text>
  <text start="1487.06" dur="4.76">because they get destroyed at that point</text>

  <text start="1518.83" dur="3.6">people who died during the Millennium</text>
  <text start="1520.45" dur="3.63">but placed their faith in Messiah and</text>

  <text start="1532.39" dur="5.01">atonement at that great white throne</text>

  <text start="1549.55" dur="2.82">new moons and the Shabbat and the feast</text>
  <text start="1551.08" dur="3.09">days but it&amp;#39;s gonna be different because</text>

  <text start="1554.17" dur="3.39">and earth pass away not one jot or till</text>
  <text start="1556" dur="2.7">and my tour will pass away well the</text>
  <text start="1557.56" dur="2.91">heavens and earth have now passed away</text>

  <text start="1601.06" dur="6.24">with the devil and his angels</text>
  <text start="1603.01" dur="7.71">and so that&amp;#39;s when Sukkot is fulfilled</text>
  <text start="1607.3" dur="6.51">is is like that new heavens and new</text>
