  <text start="127.61" dur="3.6">this week between senators Lindsey</text>
  <text start="129.02" dur="4.56">Graham and Supreme Court justice nominee</text>
  <text start="131.21" dur="4.62">Brett Kavanaugh below I give you a</text>
  <text start="133.58" dur="3.93">transcript of the exchange I&amp;#39;ve written</text>
  <text start="135.83" dur="3.57">in the past about the fact that there</text>
  <text start="137.51" dur="3.63">are some very big things coming down the</text>
  <text start="139.4" dur="3.3">pike regarding treasonous acts committed</text>
  <text start="141.14" dur="4.44">by our previous administration and</text>
  <text start="142.7" dur="4.8">others I also wrote in regards to high</text>
  <text start="145.58" dur="3.15">treason the authority to try such acts</text>
  <text start="147.5" dur="3.15">could be turned over to military</text>
  <text start="148.73" dur="4.92">tribunals and tried in military courts</text>
  <text start="150.65" dur="5.67">is this a foreshadowing of things to</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="4.53">come read the following dialogue that</text>
  <text start="156.32" dur="3.54">occurred at the Cavanaugh hearing and if</text>
  <text start="158.18" dur="3">you haven&amp;#39;t watched this on YouTube I</text>
  <text start="159.86" dur="4.44">encourage you to do that it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="161.18" dur="4.71">fascinating exchange but Senator Graham</text>
  <text start="164.3" dur="4.56">this happened I think a day or two ago</text>
  <text start="165.89" dur="6.39">during the hearings he asked the judge</text>
  <text start="168.86" dur="4.98">not the judge Cavanaugh he said is there</text>
  <text start="172.28" dur="4.02">a body of law called the law of armed</text>
  <text start="173.84" dur="5.07">conflict Cavanaugh responded there is</text>
  <text start="176.3" dur="5.22">such a body senator is there a body of</text>
  <text start="178.91" dur="4.56">law that&amp;#39;s called basic criminal law yes</text>
  <text start="181.52" dur="4.89">senator are there differences between</text>
  <text start="183.47" dur="4.86">those two bodies of law yes senator do</text>
  <text start="186.41" dur="3.15">your constitutional rights follow you if</text>
  <text start="188.33" dur="2.46">you&amp;#39;re in Paris does the Fourth</text>
  <text start="189.56" dur="3.66">Amendment protect you as an American</text>

  <text start="193.22" dur="4.53">government yes as a protector in</text>
  <text start="195.26" dur="3.96">Afghanistan in Afghanistan you also have</text>
  <text start="197.75" dur="4.11">constitutional rights against the US</text>
  <text start="199.22" dur="4.71">government isn&amp;#39;t there also long-settled</text>
  <text start="201.86" dur="3.84">law that goes back to a case and then</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="4.74">Cavanaugh interrupts Johnson versus</text>
  <text start="205.7" dur="4.02">eisentrager then American citizens who</text>
  <text start="208.67" dur="3.3">collaborate with the enemy are</text>
  <text start="209.72" dur="3.48">considered enemy combatants hmm</text>
  <text start="211.97" dur="3.299">interesting</text>
  <text start="213.2" dur="3.96">comment response they can be sometimes</text>
  <text start="215.269" dur="4.071">treated criminally sometimes treated in</text>
  <text start="217.16" dur="4.2">the military</text>
  <text start="219.34" dur="3.76">Senator Graham there&amp;#39;s a Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="221.36" dur="3.599">decision that said American citizens who</text>
  <text start="223.1" dur="3.72">collaborated with Nazi saboteurs were</text>
  <text start="224.959" dur="4.411">tried by the military is that correct</text>
  <text start="226.82" dur="5.73">that is correct I think a couple of them</text>
  <text start="229.37" dur="5.7">were executed yeah so Senator Graham&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.55" dur="4.08">talking about people who betrayed the</text>
  <text start="235.07" dur="2.97">United States American citizens who</text>
  <text start="236.63" dur="3.3">betrayed him knighted States and were</text>
  <text start="238.04" dur="4.38">tried in a military tribunal and were</text>
  <text start="239.93" dur="5.94">executed why is he bringing this topic</text>
  <text start="242.42" dur="6">up hmm Cavanaugh yeah</text>
  <text start="245.87" dur="4.02">senator Graham then turns it appears to</text>
  <text start="248.42" dur="4.409">be addressing the audience for this next</text>
  <text start="249.89" dur="5.019">part he&amp;#39;s addressing</text>
  <text start="252.829" dur="3.28">and this is a point that he wants to</text>
  <text start="254.909" dur="3.061">make unusually clear</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="3.78">senator Graham says so if anybody doubts</text>
  <text start="257.97" dur="3.449">there&amp;#39;s a long standing history in this</text>
  <text start="259.889" dur="3.691">country that your console rights follow</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="3.481">you but you don&amp;#39;t have a right to turn</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="3.149">on your own government and collaborate</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="4.109">with an enemy of the nation you will be</text>
  <text start="266.729" dur="3.931">treated differently what&amp;#39;s the name of</text>
  <text start="269.009" dur="3.331">the case if you can recall to reaffirm</text>
  <text start="270.66" dur="3.629">the concept that you could hold an enemy</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="4.079">combatant if they were one of our own if</text>
  <text start="274.289" dur="3.271">they&amp;#39;re engaged in enemy activities in</text>
  <text start="276.419" dur="2.161">Afghanistan are you familiar with that</text>
  <text start="277.56" dur="4.02">case Cavanaugh</text>
  <text start="278.58" dur="5.25">yes Hamdi senator grant so the bottom</text>
  <text start="281.58" dur="4.019">line is on every American citizen though</text>
  <text start="283.83" dur="3.809">you have constants of constitutional</text>
  <text start="285.599" dur="3.721">rights you do not have a right to</text>
  <text start="287.639" dur="3.391">collaborate with the enemy there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="3.27">body of law develop long before 9/11</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="3.93">that understood the difference between</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="3.06">basic criminal law and the law of armed</text>
  <text start="294.96" dur="2.12">conflict</text>
  <text start="295.65" dur="3.359">do you understand those differences</text>
  <text start="297.08" dur="3.339">Kavanaugh I do understand there are</text>

  <text start="524.43" dur="5.49">the regular civilian courts so Trump is</text>
  <text start="527.79" dur="4.349">actually been having to replace judges</text>
  <text start="529.92" dur="3.57">in both courts by the way because</text>
  <text start="532.139" dur="3.721">there&amp;#39;s been corrupt judges in them in</text>
  <text start="533.49" dur="4.589">the military and in the civil courts the</text>
  <text start="535.86" dur="3.57">criminal courts so he&amp;#39;s been working on</text>
  <text start="538.079" dur="2.581">replacing those judges that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.43" dur="4.23">been doing for the last two years and</text>
  <text start="540.66" dur="5.25">why we have that loop on this now why</text>
  <text start="543.66" dur="5.25">has this not happened yet I mean again</text>
  <text start="545.91" dur="5.039">I&amp;#39;ve talked to my source and I week and</text>

  <text start="555.089" dur="3.99">know it should happen like months ago</text>
  <text start="556.339" dur="4.271">only thing I think of is that Trump is</text>
  <text start="559.079" dur="4.2">still in the process of replacing</text>
  <text start="560.61" dur="3.93">corrupt judges which seems to be</text>
  <text start="563.279" dur="5.881">evidenced by the headline earlier this</text>
  <text start="564.54" dur="6.96">week where good old Kevin Spacey who you</text>
  <text start="569.16" dur="7.02">know we all know is a pedophile got off</text>
  <text start="571.5" dur="7.05">got off because of a corrupt judge so I</text>
  <text start="576.18" dur="4.8">suppose Trump is still still trying to</text>
  <text start="578.55" dur="4.289">do that I would think and I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="580.98" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t have any reason to say this no no</text>
  <text start="582.839" dur="5.25">sources told me this I&amp;#39;m just using my</text>
  <text start="584.67" dur="6.24">own brain but I would think given the</text>
  <text start="588.089" dur="5.971">context of the political climate and</text>
  <text start="590.91" dur="5.7">what has happened that Trump would have</text>
  <text start="594.06" dur="4.05">to at least begin moving publicly on</text>
  <text start="596.61" dur="4.05">these indictments and arrests and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="598.11" dur="4.709">talking high-profile arrests before the</text>
  <text start="600.66" dur="4.44">midterm elections that&amp;#39;s what I would</text>
  <text start="602.819" dur="5.07">think he did make an interesting</text>
  <text start="605.1" dur="5.669">statement in that rally yesterday in</text>
  <text start="607.889" dur="5.581">Montana where he said you know he took</text>
  <text start="610.769" dur="4.831">17 opponents down of course you know q</text>
  <text start="613.47" dur="3.479">is the 17th letter of the alphabet that</text>
  <text start="615.6" dur="2.729">doesn&amp;#39;t really matter much because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616.949" dur="6.841">made that statement many times before</text>
  <text start="618.329" dur="7.711">but he said very clearly I took down the</text>
  <text start="623.79" dur="6.57">bush dice or now I beat the bush dynasty</text>
  <text start="626.04" dur="6.75">I beat the bush dynasty well let&amp;#39;s hope</text>
  <text start="630.36" dur="5.64">that that means he&amp;#39;s gonna now take down</text>
  <text start="632.79" dur="5.07">and arrest the bush dynasty someone</text>
  <text start="636" dur="3.509">suggested to me that Cavanaugh even</text>
  <text start="637.86" dur="3.86">though he was definitely part of the</text>
  <text start="639.509" dur="7.38">whole Bush cabal as a young man in his</text>
  <text start="641.72" dur="7.33">thirties back in the 90s that maybe he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.889" dur="2.981">been flipped from a black hat to a white</text>
  <text start="649.05" dur="3.52">hat and now</text>
  <text start="649.87" dur="4.35">ready to turn and and and help Trump go</text>
  <text start="652.57" dur="3.42">after these people because he does have</text>
  <text start="654.22" dur="5.369">a lot of dirt I mean he was the bagman</text>
  <text start="655.99" dur="5.61">for Vince Foster&amp;#39;s murder so he does</text>
  <text start="659.589" dur="3.661">have a lot of dirt now can I can I come</text>
  <text start="661.6" dur="4.32">an accessory to murder really go from a</text>
  <text start="663.25" dur="4.73">black to white hat I don&amp;#39;t know to me</text>
  <text start="665.92" dur="4.169">that brings up a whole host of troubling</text>
  <text start="667.98" dur="5.59">questions that I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m in</text>
  <text start="670.089" dur="6.301">the mood to explore at this point but if</text>
  <text start="673.57" dur="5.04">he has been flipped or if they have</text>
  <text start="676.39" dur="4.08">something on Cavanaugh that trumps</text>
  <text start="678.61" dur="4.919">pressuring him with in order to force</text>
  <text start="680.47" dur="8.16">him to cooperate you know are they gonna</text>
  <text start="683.529" dur="10.071">force Mueller to turn on you know these</text>
  <text start="688.63" dur="7.38">other guys rod rod rod rosin Stein and</text>
  <text start="693.6" dur="4.39">and some others you know are they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="696.01" dur="5.46">gonna use Mueller eventually to do that</text>
  <text start="697.99" dur="6.42">pressure him I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="701.47" dur="4.71">but Q seems to be suggesting that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="704.41" dur="4.98">gonna see something very very soon</text>
  <text start="706.18" dur="5.19">of course everyone that is against Q</text>
  <text start="709.39" dur="3.75">they criticize him because one of his</text>
  <text start="711.37" dur="4.35">first drops way back last year in</text>
  <text start="713.14" dur="3.72">November of 2017 was that Hillary and</text>
  <text start="715.72" dur="3.09">Podesta and these people are gonna get</text>
  <text start="716.86" dur="3.57">arrested and of course that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="718.81" dur="3.42">happen</text>
  <text start="720.43" dur="5.01">and when that didn&amp;#39;t happen people like</text>
  <text start="722.23" dur="5.79">that this is just a big lark but what if</text>
  <text start="725.44" dur="4.17">everything he suggested that we thought</text>
  <text start="728.02" dur="4.62">was for November of last year</text>
  <text start="729.61" dur="6.09">what if it&amp;#39;s for this time period this</text>
  <text start="732.64" dur="5.819">year we&amp;#39;ve heard this September</text>
  <text start="735.7" dur="4.38">preparedness declaration which yes we</text>
  <text start="738.459" dur="3.931">know that September traditionally gets</text>
  <text start="740.08" dur="5.25">declared this by by preview no it was</text>
  <text start="742.39" dur="7.47">done by george w bush and obama but q</text>
  <text start="745.33" dur="5.85">specifically zeroed in on that which</text>
  <text start="749.86" dur="4.729">makes me think there&amp;#39;s something more to</text>
  <text start="751.18" dur="9.45">it than just the normal declaration and</text>
  <text start="754.589" dur="8.5">then these you know drops by q that talk</text>
  <text start="760.63" dur="8.55">about a red october the fact that the</text>
  <text start="763.089" dur="7.531">jewish feast days are in october I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="769.18" dur="2.49">just throw this out at you because I</text>
  <text start="770.62" dur="2.73">don&amp;#39;t know how many people are going to</text>
  <text start="771.67" dur="3.24">take this seriously but if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="773.35" dur="3.96">studied anything about the subject of a</text>
  <text start="774.91" dur="5.84">reverse speech you play someone&amp;#39;s speech</text>
  <text start="777.31" dur="5.4">backwards it supposedly is supposed to</text>
  <text start="780.75" dur="4.18">give you insight to their stuff</text>
  <text start="782.71" dur="4.05">audience what they&amp;#39;re thinking oh there</text>
  <text start="784.93" dur="5.64">is a speech that someone sent me that</text>
  <text start="786.76" dur="6.12">Trump made in early September a few days</text>
  <text start="790.57" dur="5.37">ago I think it was September 4th and if</text>
  <text start="792.88" dur="7.98">you play it backwards he distinctly says</text>
  <text start="795.94" dur="8.64">nuclear war october know nuke of the war</text>
  <text start="800.86" dur="6.54">or nuclear or something the 10th yeah I</text>

  <text start="807.4" dur="3.93">say that September 11 2001 when those</text>
  <text start="809.62" dur="5.64">attacks happened that that year it was</text>
  <text start="811.33" dur="6.12">the 23rd of the 60 per month 7 days</text>

  <text start="822.25" dur="7.23">3rd so is that a date to watch I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="826.27" dur="4.35">know so it&amp;#39;s I think it&amp;#39;s getting to see</text>
  <text start="829.48" dur="4.68">what happens in the September they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="830.62" dur="5.61">doing a nationwide alert on etiquette</text>
  <text start="834.16" dur="5.43">September 20th or 21st somewhere around</text>

  <text start="853.66" dur="4.71">use the emergency broadcast system to</text>
  <text start="855.61" dur="3.93">bypass all the MSM in order to</text>
  <text start="858.37" dur="2.87">communicate to the American people when</text>
  <text start="859.54" dur="4.29">these arrests start going down</text>
  <text start="861.24" dur="5.53">so is that tied in to this I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="863.83" dur="5.28">but I get the feeling with everything</text>
  <text start="866.77" dur="5.07">that I&amp;#39;m seeing and with this exchange</text>
  <text start="869.11" dur="5.25">in the hearings and with what Q saying</text>
