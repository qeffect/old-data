  <text start="269.44" dur="5.31">time and when she didn&amp;#39;t want to talk to</text>
  <text start="272.919" dur="3.241">me she wasn&amp;#39;t repentant she was bringing</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="5.66">up other topics and so I finally I</text>
  <text start="276.16" dur="6.45">called her and we talked for a while and</text>
  <text start="280.41" dur="4.36">it sort of seemed at first in her</text>
  <text start="282.61" dur="3.69">conversation that she was like okay yeah</text>
  <text start="284.77" dur="3.119">what I you know the way I reacted on</text>
  <text start="286.3" dur="3.27">Thursday night was wrong I&amp;#39;m sorry and</text>
  <text start="287.889" dur="3.721">you know I&amp;#39;m gonna I&amp;#39;m gonna strive my</text>
  <text start="289.57" dur="5.4">best to be excited about when the holy</text>
  <text start="291.61" dur="4.98">spirit guides on things but but then she</text>
  <text start="294.97" dur="3.21">wanted to then say how upset she was</text>
  <text start="296.59" dur="3.12">about the way I responded her and I I</text>
  <text start="298.18" dur="3.75">did I came down and her like a ton of</text>
  <text start="299.71" dur="3.39">bricks I on Thursday night when she said</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="2.489">what she said I was like you know I</text>
  <text start="303.1" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t want to have anything to do with a</text>
  <text start="304.419" dur="4.441">woman especially someone who&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="306.43" dur="5.37">my wife who&amp;#39;s gonna criticize my</text>
  <text start="308.86" dur="4.58">relationship with ya so I did come down</text>
  <text start="311.8" dur="3.6">on her like a ton of bricks but but she</text>
  <text start="313.44" dur="3.37">even though she was sort of saying with</text>
  <text start="315.4" dur="3.69">her lips okay I&amp;#39;m sorry than everything</text>
  <text start="316.81" dur="4.65">she just wanted to continue to say how</text>
  <text start="319.09" dur="3.6">much she was upset with me about the way</text>
  <text start="321.46" dur="3.54">I responded on Thursday night which</text>
  <text start="322.69" dur="4.44">again it showed me that I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="325" dur="6.27">she realized that her reaction is very</text>
  <text start="327.13" dur="6.06">serious because more than how attractive</text>
  <text start="331.27" dur="4.709">she might be or how many interests we</text>
  <text start="333.19" dur="4.92">have in common or anything like that the</text>
  <text start="335.979" dur="4.741">most important thing is that I marry a</text>
  <text start="338.11" dur="5.309">woman who she has enough faith in yah</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="4.89">where she knows that Daniel John Lee is</text>
  <text start="343.419" dur="4.591">to be my husband my head and I can trust</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="4.619">that the Holy Spirit is within his heart</text>
  <text start="348.01" dur="3.96">and that he&amp;#39;s gonna guide me and that if</text>
  <text start="350.229" dur="3.151">I ever think that my husband&amp;#39;s off I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="351.97" dur="3.21">just gonna pray to God and y&amp;#39;all will</text>
  <text start="353.38" dur="4.349">deal with him now that&amp;#39;s the godly wife</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="5.7">I mean and I even I said the stur I said</text>
  <text start="357.729" dur="5.221">is it unrealistic for me to want a wife</text>
  <text start="360.88" dur="3.45">who&amp;#39;s gonna be always encouraging and</text>
  <text start="362.95" dur="3.96">excited about how the Holy Spirit guides</text>
  <text start="364.33" dur="4.32">me well anyway she wasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="366.91" dur="3.42">repentant she was just more wanting to</text>
  <text start="368.65" dur="3.84">let me know how upset she was that the</text>
  <text start="370.33" dur="4.5">way I responded to her and so she might</text>
  <text start="372.49" dur="4.08">have hanging up on me and so I I called</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="4.47">her back you know and I left a voicemail</text>
  <text start="376.57" dur="5.07">very calm I spoke very I didn&amp;#39;t raise my</text>
  <text start="379.3" dur="5.13">voice I just spoke very calmly and I</text>
  <text start="381.64" dur="4.32">just said you know I&amp;#39;m blocking you on</text>
  <text start="384.43" dur="2.97">Facebook I&amp;#39;m removing you from the</text>
  <text start="385.96" dur="1.8">prayer list I mean she wasn&amp;#39;t coming to</text>
  <text start="387.4" dur="2.07">the</text>
  <text start="387.76" dur="4.77">because anyway but I&amp;#39;m removing you from</text>
  <text start="389.47" dur="4.8">the prayer list and I&amp;#39;m done I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="392.53" dur="2.94">I&amp;#39;m done with this I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="394.27" dur="2.91">continue to play Jews to keep these</text>
  <text start="395.47" dur="3.53">games because obviously you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="397.18" dur="4.73">interested in truly being a godly wife</text>
  <text start="399" dur="5.38">now I&amp;#39;ve been praying about this and</text>
  <text start="401.91" dur="6.79">talking to others about this as well</text>

  <text start="415.48" dur="5.46">woman I know that I know that but as</text>
  <text start="419.71" dur="4.83">I&amp;#39;ve been praying about this whole</text>
  <text start="420.94" dur="6.45">situation and now that it looks like my</text>

  <text start="427.39" dur="3.66">no there&amp;#39;s no hope for her wanting to</text>
  <text start="429.28" dur="4.46">truly be a godly woman and at least at</text>
  <text start="431.05" dur="5.31">this point hopefully she&amp;#39;ll eventually</text>
  <text start="433.74" dur="4.12">mature and I think maybe maybe she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.36" dur="5.16">just doing a baby Christian I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="437.86" dur="6.03">but in any case as I&amp;#39;ve been praying</text>
  <text start="441.52" dur="5.97">y&amp;#39;all need to sort of paths before me</text>
  <text start="443.89" dur="5.61">one is that somehow the Holy Spirit is</text>
  <text start="447.49" dur="4.8">gonna talk to a godly woman out there</text>
  <text start="449.5" dur="5.16">someone out there and the Holy Spirit&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="473.8" dur="4.26">gonna happen which honestly that seems</text>
  <text start="476.62" dur="2.76">sort of unrealistic I mean I would have</text>
  <text start="478.06" dur="2.73">to be a miracle that would have to be an</text>
  <text start="479.38" dur="3.78">absolute miracle hope you like an Isaac</text>
  <text start="480.79" dur="4.34">Rebekah type thing you know Rebecca had</text>
  <text start="483.16" dur="5.1">to make that choice but Rebekah</text>
