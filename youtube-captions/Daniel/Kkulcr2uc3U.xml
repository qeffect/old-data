  <text start="52.829" dur="4.431">selling it is a day of rest is also a</text>

  <text start="87.81" dur="4.5">will see toward the top of the website</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="6.03">that I have recently posted a Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="92.31" dur="5.099">article which deals with teshuva which</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="3.659">is the Hebrew word for repentance so I</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="3.6">encourage everyone to go read that</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="5.941">article to get a very good idea of what</text>
  <text start="101.009" dur="6.711">true Yeshua is not and what true to</text>
  <text start="104.67" dur="7.229">Shuba is and I use some scriptural</text>
  <text start="107.72" dur="6.82">examples to prove that so for my Yom</text>
  <text start="111.899" dur="4.26">Kippur podcast I&amp;#39;m not going to deal so</text>
  <text start="114.54" dur="2.969">much with repentance or tissue but</text>
  <text start="116.159" dur="5.361">because that&amp;#39;s what my article covers</text>
  <text start="117.509" dur="8.25">even though Yom Kippur is largely about</text>
  <text start="121.52" dur="5.549">repentance or teshuva returning and</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="4.321">atonement</text>
  <text start="127.069" dur="5.92">whereas Passover and unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="130.08" dur="3.69">and first fruits centers around the side</text>
  <text start="132.989" dur="3.841">of a</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="5.7">helmut and what Yahshua did to bring</text>
  <text start="136.83" dur="9.09">atonement to mankind Yom Kippur centers</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="10.77">more on the human side mainly the humans</text>
  <text start="145.92" dur="6.45">need absolute need for atonement just</text>
  <text start="150.24" dur="4.05">how depraved and wicked our natural</text>
  <text start="152.37" dur="6.06">condition is and how much we desperately</text>
  <text start="154.29" dur="6.51">need an atonement to cover our sins and</text>
  <text start="158.43" dur="4.77">to make us one with God in fact if you</text>
  <text start="160.8" dur="5.25">look at the word atonement this is Yom</text>
  <text start="163.2" dur="4.62">Kippur which means Day of Atonement if</text>
  <text start="166.05" dur="7.11">you look at the word atonement it means</text>
  <text start="167.82" dur="6.93">at one mint so it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a holiday</text>
  <text start="173.16" dur="7.44">that we celebrate that talks about how</text>
  <text start="174.75" dur="7.92">we could be at one with a holy Yahweh so</text>
  <text start="180.6" dur="3.54">tonight I want to cover a certain aspect</text>
  <text start="182.67" dur="3.06">of Yom Kippur which i think is often</text>
  <text start="184.14" dur="5.82">misunderstood and it&amp;#39;s in Leviticus</text>
  <text start="185.73" dur="8.43">chapter 16 Leviticus 16 we were given</text>
  <text start="189.96" dur="6">well 34 verses that cover exactly what</text>
  <text start="194.16" dur="5.85">the high priest and the Levitical</text>
  <text start="195.96" dur="5.49">priests did on this yom kippur this one</text>
  <text start="200.01" dur="3.69">day out of the year the only day in</text>
  <text start="201.45" dur="4.53">which the high priest was allowed to</text>
  <text start="203.7" dur="6.21">enter into the most holy place where the</text>
  <text start="205.98" dur="5.79">Ark of the Covenant was and as you read</text>
  <text start="209.91" dur="3.96">through Leviticus 16 and I encourage you</text>
  <text start="211.77" dur="5.939">to read through the entire chapter of</text>
  <text start="213.87" dur="5.91">Leviticus 16 on this Yom Kippur we</text>
  <text start="217.709" dur="3.361">discover something very interesting we</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="2.88">discover that in the midst of the</text>
  <text start="221.07" dur="3.45">sacrifices and the Senate Oh moments</text>
  <text start="222.66" dur="3.98">that are offered for first the high</text>
  <text start="224.52" dur="5.52">priests and then for the people that</text>
  <text start="226.64" dur="8.29">there are two specific goats that are</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="9.3">taken and lots are cast or a dice like a</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="7.38">dice is thrown and upon the goat that</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="4.71">Yahweh&amp;#39;s lot falls upon that goat is</text>
  <text start="242.31" dur="5.34">then offered as a sin offering the goat</text>
  <text start="244.05" dur="5.58">is killed and the blood of this goat is</text>
  <text start="247.65" dur="4.2">brought into the most holy place and</text>
  <text start="249.63" dur="5.4">then the high priest takes the blood of</text>
  <text start="251.85" dur="9.54">this goat and sprinkles the the Ark of</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="9.9">the Covenant the other goat is which</text>
  <text start="261.39" dur="5.14">which is not does not have Yahweh&amp;#39;s lot</text>
  <text start="264.93" dur="5.38">upon it</text>
  <text start="266.53" dur="9.96">this other goat is brought into the</text>
  <text start="270.31" dur="12.63">wilderness and the this goat is released</text>
  <text start="276.49" dur="9.36">into the wilderness and it&amp;#39;s usually a</text>
  <text start="282.94" dur="4.17">very desolate place where it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="285.85" dur="4.83">unlikely the goat is even going to</text>
  <text start="287.11" dur="5.07">survive before this goes released into</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="3.75">the wilderness however the high priest</text>
  <text start="292.18" dur="5.01">will lay both his hands upon the head of</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="4.62">this goat and confess over this goat all</text>
  <text start="297.19" dur="4.259">the iniquities of the children of Israel</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="4.98">and all their transgressions in all</text>
  <text start="301.449" dur="6.181">their sins putting them upon the head of</text>
  <text start="304.03" dur="5.25">the goat and then she&amp;#39;ll send this go to</text>
  <text start="307.63" dur="5.159">way by the hand of a fit man into the</text>
  <text start="309.28" dur="6.33">wilderness and the goat shall bear upon</text>
  <text start="312.789" dur="5.011">him all their iniquities unto a land not</text>
  <text start="315.61" dur="8.97">inhabited and he shall let the goat the</text>
  <text start="317.8" dur="8.82">goat go into the wilderness so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="7.23">interesting that we have these two</text>
  <text start="326.62" dur="7.44">different goats that are that are that</text>
  <text start="331.81" dur="5.789">are that are talked about here so again</text>
  <text start="334.06" dur="6.359">we have two goats are taken and the high</text>
  <text start="337.599" dur="4.44">priest cast lots or throws dice one lot</text>
  <text start="340.419" dur="4.891">for Yahweh and the other lot for the</text>
  <text start="342.039" dur="5.221">scapegoat and of course the goat upon</text>
  <text start="345.31" dur="2.55">which Yahweh&amp;#39;s lot falls upon is</text>
  <text start="347.26" dur="2.01">sacrificed</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="3.75">but then the other goat is called the</text>
  <text start="349.27" dur="3.48">scapegoat and that&amp;#39;s the good upon which</text>
  <text start="351.61" dur="2.61">all the sins of the people are</text>
  <text start="352.75" dur="4.74">confessing it&amp;#39;s sent out into this until</text>
  <text start="354.22" dur="4.8">this desolate wilderness so oftentimes</text>
  <text start="357.49" dur="3.209">people will ask well what what does this</text>
  <text start="359.02" dur="3.6">mean what what what did this have to do</text>
  <text start="360.699" dur="3.72">with Yom Kippur and what is what is this</text>
  <text start="362.62" dur="3.21">practice mean and I&amp;#39;ve every a lot of</text>
  <text start="364.419" dur="4.261">different articles on the subject and</text>
  <text start="365.83" dur="3.78">people have theorized that the goat</text>
  <text start="368.68" dur="4.799">that&amp;#39;s led out into the wilderness</text>
  <text start="369.61" dur="7.619">represents Satan and and and sin and the</text>
  <text start="373.479" dur="5.131">goat that&amp;#39;s offered on on on the altar</text>
  <text start="377.229" dur="2.97">and the blood is used to sprinkle the</text>
  <text start="378.61" dur="4.08">Ark of the Covenant it represents you</text>
  <text start="380.199" dur="4.051">and everything but as I&amp;#39;ve read these</text>
  <text start="382.69" dur="3.86">articles I haven&amp;#39;t just haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="384.25" dur="6.12">quite satisfied with their explanation</text>
  <text start="386.55" dur="6.01">and upon reading Leviticus 16 again I</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="4.109">think I I would like to offer what I</text>
  <text start="392.56" dur="4.95">believe this this passage is very</text>
  <text start="394.479" dur="5.221">clearly speaking about obviously the</text>
  <text start="397.51" dur="4.95">first goat upon which Yahweh&amp;#39;s lot falls</text>
  <text start="399.7" dur="5.15">obviously this goat represents Yahweh</text>
  <text start="402.46" dur="6.93">offering himself for us which happened</text>
  <text start="404.85" dur="7.09">through Yahshua his son and so the the</text>
  <text start="409.39" dur="3.96">the killing of the goat the taking of</text>
  <text start="411.94" dur="3.84">the blood into the most holy place the</text>
  <text start="413.35" dur="4.98">splashing of the blood upon the Ark of</text>
  <text start="415.78" dur="5.49">the Covenant all of this is very much a</text>
  <text start="418.33" dur="5.64">picture of what Yahshua did in spilling</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="6">his blood for us then the other goat</text>
  <text start="423.97" dur="6.66">which is known as the scapegoat I think</text>
  <text start="427.27" dur="5.31">that this is another representation of</text>
  <text start="430.63" dur="4.29">Yahshua Adam not I do not think in any</text>
  <text start="432.58" dur="3.69">way this goat represents Satan at all in</text>
  <text start="434.92" dur="3.9">fact I think to say that this goat</text>
  <text start="436.27" dur="5.04">represents Satan is blasphemous because</text>
  <text start="438.82" dur="4.92">I think this go very clearly emphasizes</text>
  <text start="441.31" dur="4.41">another aspect of Yahshua of yah and his</text>
  <text start="443.74" dur="4.5">atonement for us because if you remember</text>
  <text start="445.72" dur="5.13">when he was nailed to the cross it says</text>
  <text start="448.24" dur="5.67">all the sins of the world were placed</text>
  <text start="450.85" dur="5.37">upon him that that he became sin for us</text>
  <text start="453.91" dur="6.27">that literally the sins of all mankind</text>
  <text start="456.22" dur="5.73">were placed upon Joshua&amp;#39;s head and that</text>
  <text start="460.18" dur="3.33">is exactly what happens to this goat all</text>
  <text start="461.95" dur="3.6">the sins of the people are confessed</text>
  <text start="463.51" dur="3.99">placed upon this goat this goat</text>
  <text start="465.55" dur="3.63">figuratively bears the sins of the</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="3.72">people and let this go to sent out into</text>
  <text start="469.18" dur="3.27">a wilderness just as Joshua had to go</text>
  <text start="471.22" dur="4.41">into the wilderness of being cut off</text>
  <text start="472.45" dur="7.2">from his father and being nailed to the</text>
  <text start="475.63" dur="5.64">cross so I think both the goat that you</text>
  <text start="479.65" dur="4.2">always thought falls upon an escape goat</text>
  <text start="481.27" dur="7.31">both represent two different aspects of</text>
  <text start="483.85" dur="6.9">how Yahshua brought atonement to us</text>
  <text start="488.58" dur="4.12">atonement the Day of Atonement Yom</text>
  <text start="490.75" dur="3.54">Kippur the reason we fast the reason we</text>
  <text start="492.7" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t eat the reason we don&amp;#39;t drink the</text>
  <text start="494.29" dur="6.44">reason we meditate upon our need for an</text>
  <text start="496.96" dur="6.96">atonement and why we do this once a year</text>
  <text start="500.73" dur="5.86">again is to highlight how much we need</text>
  <text start="503.92" dur="6.54">an atonement how much we need yeah how</text>
  <text start="506.59" dur="6.06">much we as humans tend to follow our</text>
  <text start="510.46" dur="4.29">wicked ways and we become separated from</text>
  <text start="512.65" dur="4.949">yah and that the only way to become at</text>
  <text start="514.75" dur="6.63">one with this holy being with this holy</text>
  <text start="517.599" dur="5.82">yah is through to Shuba which is</text>
  <text start="521.38" dur="4.35">repentance confessing your sin turning</text>
  <text start="523.419" dur="4.681">away from it forsaking it but it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="525.73" dur="4.44">through atonement that atonement is</text>
  <text start="528.1" dur="4.28">absolutely necessary because you know</text>
  <text start="530.17" dur="4.25">you can genuinely repent of all your sin</text>
  <text start="532.38" dur="3.39">but that still leaves the sins that</text>
  <text start="534.42" dur="3">you&amp;#39;ve already committed the Passons</text>
  <text start="535.77" dur="2.88">there and those have to be dealt with</text>
  <text start="537.42" dur="4.35">and the only way to deal with that is</text>
  <text start="538.65" dur="4.89">through an atonement and so Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="541.77" dur="4.44">is distinct from Passover in that it</text>
  <text start="543.54" dur="4.62">highlights more of man&amp;#39;s need for</text>
  <text start="546.21" dur="5.13">atonement our depravity our wickedness</text>
  <text start="548.16" dur="4.47">our our need for this atonement and I</text>
  <text start="551.34" dur="3.24">believe Yom Kippur is ultimately</text>
  <text start="552.63" dur="4.47">fulfilled at the great white throne</text>
  <text start="554.58" dur="4.77">judgment at the end of the 1,000 years</text>
  <text start="557.1" dur="3.81">after Satan has been released and then</text>
  <text start="559.35" dur="4.14">thrown in the lake of fire</text>
  <text start="560.91" dur="4.02">all the dead great and small who have</text>
  <text start="563.49" dur="3.84">not been resurrected up until this point</text>
  <text start="564.93" dur="4.82">are resurrected they faced the great</text>
  <text start="567.33" dur="4.47">judge yeah on the white throne and</text>
  <text start="569.75" dur="3.82">judgment is given and I believe this is</text>
  <text start="571.8" dur="5.99">where Yom Kippur in Revelation chapter</text>
  <text start="573.57" dur="8.31">20 is finally and completely fulfilled</text>
  <text start="577.79" dur="6.37">so meditate upon Leviticus 16 meditate</text>
  <text start="581.88" dur="4.1">upon the idea of the scapegoat and how</text>
  <text start="584.16" dur="4.56">it relates to Allah did for us and</text>
  <text start="585.98" dur="5.29">meditate upon how much you as an</text>
  <text start="588.72" dur="5.43">individual need in atonement in order to</text>
  <text start="591.27" dur="3.54">become at one with yah have a very</text>
  <text start="594.15" dur="3.92">blessed</text>
  <text start="594.81" dur="3.26">Yom Kippur</text>
