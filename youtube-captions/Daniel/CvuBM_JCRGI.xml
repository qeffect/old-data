  <text start="16.02" dur="6">the Shabbat and this is now part 11 of</text>
  <text start="18.63" dur="5.93">my 17 part series reconciling the</text>
  <text start="22.02" dur="5.999">teachings of Messiah and Apostle Paul</text>
  <text start="24.56" dur="5.229">again my heart for this is for the bride</text>
  <text start="28.019" dur="3.27">of Messiah because I&amp;#39;ve seen so many</text>
  <text start="29.789" dur="3.421">people both within the Messianic</text>
  <text start="31.289" dur="4.171">movement and of course with the</text>
  <text start="33.21" dur="4.74">Christians who take Paul&amp;#39;s words and</text>
  <text start="35.46" dur="4.98">they say look we don&amp;#39;t have to obey the</text>
  <text start="37.95" dur="4.89">Torah and that is not what Paul of</text>
  <text start="40.44" dur="3.72">teaching that&amp;#39;s a false accusation that</text>
  <text start="42.84" dur="3.36">was brought against Paul in the first</text>
  <text start="44.16" dur="4.41">entry and still being brought against</text>
  <text start="46.2" dur="4.8">him in the 21st century Apostle Paul was</text>
  <text start="48.57" dur="4.8">a master of Torah he was mightily filled</text>
  <text start="51" dur="4.649">spirit and all of his teachings</text>
  <text start="53.37" dur="5.43">completely aligned with the Messiah who</text>
  <text start="55.649" dur="6.271">taught at Matthew 5:17 through 20 that</text>
  <text start="58.8" dur="4.919">he came not to abolish the Torah he came</text>
  <text start="61.92" dur="4.26">to fill up to revive to show us how to</text>
  <text start="63.719" dur="4.591">correctly obey the Torah and until the</text>
  <text start="66.18" dur="4.95">heavens and the earth pass away not one</text>
  <text start="68.31" dur="5.46">jot or one tittle will pass from the</text>
  <text start="71.13" dur="5.64">Torah from the commandments and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="73.77" dur="5.97">the Messiah I serve that&amp;#39;s the one that</text>
  <text start="76.77" dur="6.09">I believe taught and lived and continues</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="5.61">to rule and reign in heaven hallelujah</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="4.53">so we&amp;#39;re going to go now to first</text>
  <text start="85.35" dur="3.809">Timothy chapter 4 this is the passage</text>
  <text start="87.39" dur="5.46">that Christians will use to say that you</text>
  <text start="89.159" dur="5.931">can eat anything so let&amp;#39;s just start in</text>
  <text start="92.85" dur="6.269">verse 1 this is going to be 1 through 5</text>
  <text start="95.09" dur="6.489">now the spirit speaks expressly that in</text>
  <text start="99.119" dur="4.591">the latter times some shall depart from</text>
  <text start="101.579" dur="5.701">the faith giving heed to seducing</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="5.43">spirits and doctrines of devils speaking</text>
  <text start="107.28" dur="4.46">lies in hypocrisy having their</text>
  <text start="109.14" dur="5.46">conscience seared with a hot iron</text>
  <text start="111.74" dur="5.229">forbidding to marry and commanding to</text>
  <text start="114.6" dur="4.949">abstain from meats or that word is food</text>
  <text start="116.969" dur="4.531">basically which yah has created to be</text>
  <text start="119.549" dur="3.61">received with Thanksgiving of them which</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="5.02">believe and know the</text>
  <text start="123.159" dur="6.27">truth for every creature for every</text>
  <text start="126.52" dur="5.279">creature of yah is good and nothing to</text>
  <text start="129.429" dur="5.161">be refused if it be received with</text>
  <text start="131.799" dur="6.541">thanksgiving for it is sanctified by the</text>
  <text start="134.59" dur="6.59">word of yah and prayer okay so here</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="5.55">Christians will use verse 4 and say look</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="4.72">Paul very clearly says that every</text>
  <text start="143.89" dur="4.56">creature is good nothing to be refused</text>
  <text start="145.9" dur="7.8">if we&amp;#39;re thankful for it we can receive</text>
  <text start="148.45" dur="7.649">it we could eat it no that&amp;#39;s not exactly</text>
  <text start="153.7" dur="4.619">what Paul is saying because that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="156.099" dur="5.431">the end of the sentence the sentence</text>
  <text start="158.319" dur="5.191">ends at verse 5 where he says for that</text>
  <text start="161.53" dur="5.099">word for is the conjunction that also</text>
  <text start="163.51" dur="6.119">means because because it is sanctified</text>
  <text start="166.629" dur="5.761">by the word of yacht and prayer now in</text>
  <text start="169.629" dur="5.61">order for food to be sanctified by the</text>
  <text start="172.39" dur="4.439">word of yacht and prayer it has to line</text>
  <text start="175.239" dur="3.991">up with what the word of yah says now</text>
  <text start="176.829" dur="4.141">when Paul says it is sanctified by the</text>
  <text start="179.23" dur="3.45">word of yacht is he referring to the</text>
  <text start="180.97" dur="3.69">tonight at the New Testament the rig not</text>
  <text start="182.68" dur="3.809">a shot well of course not because it</text>
  <text start="184.66" dur="3.57">hadn&amp;#39;t been written yet when Paul wrote</text>
  <text start="186.489" dur="3.961">this letter to Timothy not even the</text>
  <text start="188.23" dur="3.869">Gospels had been written down yet okay</text>
  <text start="190.45" dur="3.78">nothing has been written yet in the New</text>
  <text start="192.099" dur="3.39">Testament so what is Paul referring to</text>
  <text start="194.23" dur="3.539">when he says the word of yah he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.489" dur="4.291">referring to what the Messiah referred</text>
  <text start="197.769" dur="4.31">to when he whenever he quoted scripture</text>
  <text start="199.78" dur="5.549">and that was the Torah and the prophets</text>
  <text start="202.079" dur="5.171">that&amp;#39;s what he referred to so for</text>
  <text start="205.329" dur="4.951">something to be sanctified by the word</text>
  <text start="207.25" dur="5.01">of yacht and prayer we have to go to the</text>
  <text start="210.28" dur="5.37">Torah we have to go to Leviticus chapter</text>
  <text start="212.26" dur="6.39">11 and in Leviticus chapter 11 part of</text>
  <text start="215.65" dur="6.089">the Torah it outlines what we can and</text>
  <text start="218.65" dur="6.869">cannot eat it shows us very very clearly</text>
  <text start="221.739" dur="5.881">the foods that we can or cannot eat it</text>
  <text start="225.519" dur="4.62">shows what Yad designed for human</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="5.489">consumption and what foods God did not</text>
  <text start="230.139" dur="4.921">design for human consumption this was</text>
  <text start="233.109" dur="4.53">not the punish Israel by the way this</text>
  <text start="235.06" dur="4.53">was to protect Israel this was protect</text>
  <text start="237.639" dur="4.951">Israel and if you start going through</text>
  <text start="239.59" dur="4.92">Leviticus chapter 11 I encourage you to</text>
  <text start="242.59" dur="6.75">read it one of the first things it talks</text>
  <text start="244.51" dur="7.02">about is those those animals that have</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="4.59">parted hooves but do not chew the cud so</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="4.06">that would be like a pig a pig has</text>
  <text start="253.93" dur="4.029">parted cloven hooves</text>
  <text start="255.59" dur="4.739">to the cut why are we not eat pig</text>
  <text start="257.959" dur="4.71">because pigs are natural trash cans</text>
  <text start="260.329" dur="6.361">they&amp;#39;re very similar to like dogs and</text>
  <text start="262.669" dur="5.371">cats pigs wallow in the mud they clean</text>
  <text start="266.69" dur="2.37">the earth they help clean the earth</text>
  <text start="268.04" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s their job</text>
  <text start="269.06" dur="3.87">and we&amp;#39;re not supposed to be eating</text>
  <text start="271.43" dur="3.87">these trash cans we&amp;#39;re not supposed to</text>
  <text start="272.93" dur="5.519">be eating these trash cans and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="275.3" dur="4.83">why there&amp;#39;s so much junked found in pork</text>
  <text start="278.449" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s so many worms and</text>
  <text start="280.13" dur="5.52">disease that&amp;#39;s associated with eating</text>
  <text start="282.889" dur="4.351">pork and you can go continue to go</text>
  <text start="285.65" dur="3.57">through Leviticus 11 and it shows you</text>
  <text start="287.24" dur="6.6">exactly what you should and should not</text>
  <text start="289.22" dur="6.78">eat when it comes to animals so in order</text>
  <text start="293.84" dur="5.07">for it to be sanctified by the word of</text>
  <text start="296" dur="5.49">yah and by prayer it&amp;#39;s got to line up</text>
  <text start="298.91" dur="5.64">with Leviticus 11 okay and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="301.49" dur="5.13">Paul said that so what is first Timothy</text>
  <text start="304.55" dur="3.36">4 talking about because I mean Paul is</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="2.58">clearly giving a warning that</text>
  <text start="307.91" dur="4.53">something&amp;#39;s going to happen in the last</text>
  <text start="309.2" dur="6.18">latter times in the last days where</text>
  <text start="312.44" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re going to a forbid to marry right</text>
  <text start="315.38" dur="6.32">they&amp;#39;re going to forbid to marry and and</text>
  <text start="318.05" dur="7.02">command to abstain from meats from foods</text>
  <text start="321.7" dur="5.74">well I know one thing that completely</text>
  <text start="325.07" dur="5.219">fits this prophecy that Paul gives and</text>
  <text start="327.44" dur="6.449">that is the Roman Catholic Church they</text>
  <text start="330.289" dur="6.051">forbid their priests to marry and they</text>
  <text start="333.889" dur="5.161">forbid to eat certain weeks during Lent</text>
  <text start="336.34" dur="5.41">on Fridays you could only have fish I</text>
  <text start="339.05" dur="6">know this because my dad was raised and</text>
  <text start="341.75" dur="5.25">by a Roman Catholic mother and this was</text>
  <text start="345.05" dur="3.179">a tradition that he followed so these</text>
  <text start="347" dur="4.86">are things that the Roman Catholic</text>
  <text start="348.229" dur="4.951">Church commands and it&amp;#39;s wrong of course</text>
  <text start="351.86" dur="3.9">we know the Roman Catholic Church is</text>
  <text start="353.18" dur="5.15">completely completely filled with vain</text>
  <text start="355.76" dur="5.4">tradition that opposes the word of Jaap</text>
  <text start="358.33" dur="4.39">so that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s talking about it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="361.16" dur="3.979">not saying you can just eat anything you</text>
  <text start="362.72" dur="5.22">want again Paul</text>
  <text start="365.139" dur="4.601">he was a master of Torah and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="367.94" dur="4.11">he put that in there he said it&amp;#39;s got to</text>
  <text start="369.74" dur="5.04">be sanctified by the word of yah and</text>
  <text start="372.05" dur="5.089">prayer and as long as it is then hey you</text>
