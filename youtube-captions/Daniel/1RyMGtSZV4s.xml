  <text start="9.389" dur="6.031">know what happened I had a fully clean</text>
  <text start="12.96" dur="4.53">SD card because every time I upload it</text>
  <text start="15.42" dur="3.72">to YouTube I always take the files off</text>
  <text start="17.49" dur="4.049">that SD card and drop it in the trash on</text>
  <text start="19.14" dur="4.32">my Mac and for some reason it only</text>
  <text start="21.539" dur="3.9">recorded a minute and 30 seconds of my</text>
  <text start="23.46" dur="4.77">preaching today even though I preached</text>
  <text start="25.439" dur="4.861">for hours so I don&amp;#39;t know I think maybe</text>
  <text start="28.23" dur="4.41">I have to reformat my SD card maybe</text>
  <text start="30.3" dur="3.689">every time I&amp;#39;m not sure I got to look</text>
  <text start="32.64" dur="2.759">into it and find out why it only</text>
  <text start="33.989" dur="4.921">recorded a minute in 30 seconds because</text>
  <text start="35.399" dur="5.011">nothing else was on my SD card so if any</text>
  <text start="38.91" dur="7.8">of you tech guys know about this let me</text>

  <text start="63.69" dur="3.359">so you guys read it on there I mean</text>
  <text start="65.88" dur="4.23">these signs are kind of redundant I</text>
  <text start="67.049" dur="4.761">guess so I wanted to talk a little bit</text>
  <text start="70.11" dur="5.189">about some of the stuff I preach today</text>
  <text start="71.81" dur="4.87">I&amp;#39;m gonna be posting a 8 minute</text>
  <text start="75.299" dur="3.841">conversation I have with that Sam guy</text>
  <text start="76.68" dur="4.71">again in the wheelchair I did find out</text>
  <text start="79.14" dur="4.2">more about why he didn&amp;#39;t get a healing</text>
  <text start="81.39" dur="3.57">and he you know he confessed to me that</text>
  <text start="83.34" dur="3.9">he has some secrets in going on in his</text>
  <text start="84.96" dur="4.339">life so he asked me to pray for him</text>
  <text start="87.24" dur="4.62">which I did and he started trembling I</text>
  <text start="89.299" dur="4.93">gave him not only did I pray for him but</text>
  <text start="91.86" dur="4.17">I gave him some some suggestions but he</text>
  <text start="94.229" dur="2.85">still was defending his sin even after</text>
  <text start="96.03" dur="3.15">the prayer and he was trembling</text>
  <text start="97.079" dur="4.441">violently fight he&amp;#39;s gonna get his</text>
  <text start="99.18" dur="3.689">wheelchair almost but I he started</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="4.2">defending the secret sin he was involved</text>
  <text start="102.869" dur="3.811">in so pray for him I didn&amp;#39;t record the</text>
  <text start="105.72" dur="2.31">whole conversation but just like the</text>
  <text start="106.68" dur="3">first eight minutes of it we talked for</text>
  <text start="108.03" dur="4.199">a while</text>
  <text start="109.68" dur="5.67">the other thing I preached on was</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="7.32">Thanksgiving and that the roots of</text>
  <text start="115.35" dur="6.409">Thanksgiving came from the pilgrims they</text>
  <text start="119.549" dur="4.92">were actually celebrating Sukkot and</text>
  <text start="121.759" dur="4.301">that celebration of Sukkot happened in</text>
  <text start="124.469" dur="2.721">October when it normally does on the</text>
  <text start="126.06" dur="3.449">Jewish calendar</text>
  <text start="127.19" dur="4.45">the Canadians still celebrate</text>
  <text start="129.509" dur="4.621">Thanksgiving in early October</text>
  <text start="131.64" dur="4.5">and so did we for many many hundreds of</text>
  <text start="134.13" dur="3.18">years because it was the feast of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="3.21">that&amp;#39;s what the pilgrims were</text>
  <text start="137.31" dur="4.89">celebrating with the Native Americans</text>
  <text start="139.35" dur="5.46">what happened was is that in the 1860s</text>
  <text start="142.2" dur="4.759">Abraham Lincoln President Lincoln he</text>
  <text start="144.81" dur="4.74">issued a proclamation which moved the</text>
  <text start="146.959" dur="4.721">Feast of that piece of Thanksgiving so</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="3.63">coat from the seventh month and it</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="3.05">should be to the end of the eighth month</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="4.74">which was the last Thursday in November</text>
  <text start="154.73" dur="5.35">now this actually what he did was not</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="4.59">too good because if you go to the</text>
  <text start="160.08" dur="4.59">scriptures you find out that when the</text>
  <text start="162.51" dur="4.14">ten tribes of Israel had a civil war</text>
  <text start="164.67" dur="4.65">with the Judah and Benjamin and Levi and</text>
  <text start="166.65" dur="4.86">they departed to the north</text>
  <text start="169.32" dur="3.57">they changed the feast days from the</text>
  <text start="171.51" dur="3.72">seventh Hebrew month to the eighth Eber</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="4.349">month so Lincoln&amp;#39;s you know whether</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="6.539">knowing they&amp;#39;re unknowingly sort of did</text>
  <text start="177.239" dur="5.821">the same thing so but Thanksgiving was</text>
  <text start="181.769" dur="3.031">originally celebrated knocked over by</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="2.58">the pilgrims just like the Canadians</text>
  <text start="184.8" dur="3.24">still do to this day</text>
  <text start="185.64" dur="4.98">and it was a feast of Sukkot because</text>
  <text start="188.04" dur="4.83">that is an eighth day of Thanksgiving</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="5.399">and for those of you who might be new to</text>
  <text start="192.87" dur="5.04">my channel I did do videos all through</text>
  <text start="196.019" dur="3.72">the eight days of Sukkot which was the</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="4.35">final eight days of October and he just</text>
  <text start="199.739" dur="6.361">go back to those dates and see how I</text>
  <text start="202.26" dur="7.199">celebrated Sukkot so I preached on that</text>
  <text start="206.1" dur="5.19">I preached a very sort of almost heavy</text>
  <text start="209.459" dur="4.771">prophetic word where I preached out</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="5.009">Jeremiah 51 which is about Babylon but I</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="5.569">replaced it with America with the United</text>
  <text start="216.299" dur="6.151">States and if you haven&amp;#39;t seen my video</text>
  <text start="219.799" dur="3.791">prophecy paedophiles trump x marks the</text>
  <text start="222.45" dur="2.25">spot go see it</text>
  <text start="223.59" dur="2.369">I think it&amp;#39;ll give you a good</text>
  <text start="224.7" dur="2.73">perspective of sort of where we are</text>
  <text start="225.959" dur="3.771">prophetically and how it ties in with</text>
  <text start="227.43" dur="4.41">the Satanic pedophiles being exposed and</text>
  <text start="229.73" dur="3.49">President Trump and the Jubilee year</text>
  <text start="231.84" dur="6.239">that&amp;#39;s in Torah and all that good stuff</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="6.66">so one of the things I talked with about</text>
  <text start="238.079" dur="3.66">Sammy which you&amp;#39;ll see in that video is</text>
  <text start="239.88" dur="4.32">just that although it&amp;#39;s a beautiful</text>
  <text start="241.739" dur="5.701">campus and yeah the students are</text>
  <text start="244.2" dur="6.36">well-dressed and intelligent there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="247.44" dur="5.04">lot of secrets in going on and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="4.62">even so much pointing out the atheists</text>
  <text start="252.48" dur="3.87">and agnostics and the pagans I mean yeah</text>
  <text start="255.18" dur="3.049">of course they&amp;#39;re gonna be wicked but</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="5.33">it&amp;#39;s the Christians on this campus that</text>
  <text start="258.229" dur="5.491">are basically living in sin</text>
  <text start="261.68" dur="3.6">and so they&amp;#39;re asleep and and this is</text>
  <text start="263.72" dur="3.81">sort of a microcosm of what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="4.44">in America that it&amp;#39;s the church that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="267.53" dur="4.58">asleep as to why wickedness is</text>
  <text start="269.72" dur="5.789">flourishing so much in this nation and</text>
  <text start="272.11" dur="6.52">if the church would awaken and cast off</text>
  <text start="275.509" dur="4.951">their slumber then we&amp;#39;d really see the</text>
  <text start="278.63" dur="3.93">genuine awakening like we saw in the</text>
  <text start="280.46" dur="4.47">days of the sixteen and seventeen</text>
  <text start="282.56" dur="5.07">hundreds with Jonathan Edwards John</text>
  <text start="284.93" dur="5.78">Wesley George Whitfield in the 1800&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.63" dur="5.25">with Charles Spurgeon Charles Finney and</text>
  <text start="290.71" dur="3.7">many of this if you study the first and</text>
  <text start="292.88" dur="4.319">second Great Awakenings that grip the</text>
  <text start="294.41" dur="6.47">country you&amp;#39;ll see what genuine</text>
  <text start="297.199" dur="8.551">repentance and Awakening is all about</text>
  <text start="300.88" dur="6.37">alia it&amp;#39;s a beautiful day although there</text>
