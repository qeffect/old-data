  <text start="123.149" dur="6.661">faith and then I heard it okay this is</text>
  <text start="125.43" dur="5.18">very important the same gospel that is</text>

  <text start="161.78" dur="4.29">gospel was preached it didn&amp;#39;t profit</text>
  <text start="163.94" dur="4.44">them because it wasn&amp;#39;t mixed with faith</text>

  <text start="823.16" dur="5.25">tempted like as we are yet without sin</text>
  <text start="826.04" dur="6">hallelujah this goes right back the</text>
  <text start="828.41" dur="7.53">Hebrews chapter 2 where it says very</text>
  <text start="832.04" dur="5.94">clearly um in verse 18 form that he</text>
  <text start="835.94" dur="4.17">himself has suffered being tempted he is</text>
  <text start="837.98" dur="4.32">able also to suck whore or to help them</text>
  <text start="840.11" dur="3.66">that are tempted again this is a huge</text>
  <text start="842.3" dur="5.16">theme in the book of Hebrews and this is</text>
  <text start="843.77" dur="6.33">so important to grasp Yahshua he was a</text>
  <text start="847.46" dur="4.32">high priest he was in the flesh he did</text>
  <text start="850.1" dur="3.9">not have any access to anything that we</text>
  <text start="851.78" dur="3.48">didn&amp;#39;t have access to because he gave</text>
  <text start="854" dur="3.57">all that up when he came down to the</text>
  <text start="855.26" dur="4.53">humble human being he was touched with</text>
  <text start="857.57" dur="4.5">all our infirmities okay he had</text>
  <text start="859.79" dur="4.98">weaknesses just that like we do in a</text>
  <text start="862.07" dur="4.86">frail human body and he was tempted it</text>
  <text start="864.77" dur="4.53">says in all points was he tempted like</text>
  <text start="866.93" dur="6.84">as we are he was tempted in every way to</text>
  <text start="869.3" dur="6.72">sin and yet he was without sin he always</text>
  <text start="873.77" dur="4.17">chose to rely on his father he always</text>
  <text start="876.02" dur="3.6">chose never to send from the young age</text>
  <text start="877.94" dur="6.39">that he was all went until he was</text>
  <text start="879.62" dur="7.47">resurrected he never chose us in once so</text>
  <text start="884.33" dur="5.88">because of this again when we asked for</text>
  <text start="887.09" dur="5.25">a spirit to fill us his spirit can help</text>
  <text start="890.21" dur="3.51">us because his spirit he was once down</text>
  <text start="892.34" dur="3.68">here on earth and he was confronted with</text>
  <text start="893.72" dur="4.83">all the sin and his spirit enables us to</text>
  <text start="896.02" dur="4.9">resisting sense because he did it as</text>
  <text start="898.55" dur="4.26">well he did it before that is so</text>
  <text start="900.92" dur="3.99">important to realize this is why any</text>
  <text start="902.81" dur="4.04">spirit is that does not confess that</text>
  <text start="904.91" dur="4.71">Yahshua is in the flesh is Antichrist</text>

  <text start="911.63" dur="4.92">never did to give us the power and the</text>
  <text start="913.46" dur="6.27">ability to overcome sin to overcome sin</text>

  <text start="1226.7" dur="4.32">not all I&amp;#39;m gonna say now is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1228.26" dur="4.71">because mikela deck came before the</text>

  <text start="1234.32" dur="3.51">book of Genesis but it came before</text>
  <text start="1235.85" dur="4.83">because it was a higher order and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1237.83" dur="5.1">going to learn about that it when we get</text>
  <text start="1240.68" dur="3.81">to Hebrew seven of whom we have many</text>
  <text start="1242.93" dur="5.7">things to say and hard to be uttered</text>
  <text start="1244.49" dur="5.55">seeing you are dull of hearing oh so</text>
  <text start="1248.63" dur="5.04">there the author just insults his</text>
  <text start="1250.04" dur="5.76">audience Bobby speaking the truth it</text>
  <text start="1253.67" dur="5.07">just shows that we Americans need to</text>
  <text start="1255.8" dur="4.95">grow up and not be so antsy pantsy about</text>
  <text start="1258.74" dur="3.69">things that you know hey he&amp;#39;s speaking</text>
  <text start="1260.75" dur="4.53">the truth to his audit writers as your</text>
  <text start="1262.43" dur="4.41">double hearing I have a lot more to say</text>
  <text start="1265.28" dur="2.73">on the subject but i&amp;#39;m going to refrain</text>
  <text start="1266.84" dur="4.44">right now because you&amp;#39;re not ready for</text>
  <text start="1268.01" dur="5.43">it in other words verse 12 for wind</text>
  <text start="1271.28" dur="4.38">before win for the time you ought to be</text>
  <text start="1273.44" dur="4.74">teachers you have need that one teach</text>
  <text start="1275.66" dur="4.65">you again which be the first principles</text>
  <text start="1278.18" dur="4.05">of the Oracles of yah and it becomes</text>
  <text start="1280.31" dur="3.66">such as have need of milk and not of</text>
  <text start="1282.23" dur="3.72">strong needs now he&amp;#39;s rebuking them he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1283.97" dur="3.72">going to a strong review saying look you</text>
  <text start="1285.95" dur="3.36">guys should have known all this before</text>
  <text start="1287.69" dur="4.05">but I&amp;#39;m having to lay some basic</text>
  <text start="1289.31" dur="3.75">groundwork with you you should be on</text>
  <text start="1291.74" dur="5.43">strong meat but I&amp;#39;m having to give you</text>
  <text start="1293.06" dur="6.3">milk it&amp;#39;s pretty strong rebuke here for</text>
  <text start="1297.17" dur="3.57">everyone that uses milk is unskillful in</text>
  <text start="1299.36" dur="4.35">the word of righteousness for he is a</text>
  <text start="1300.74" dur="4.86">babe but strong meat belongs to them</text>
  <text start="1303.71" dur="3.42">that are full age even those who by</text>
  <text start="1305.6" dur="3.92">reason of use have their senses</text>
  <text start="1307.13" dur="4.71">exercised to discern both good and evil</text>
  <text start="1309.52" dur="3.91">where we need to be is we need to be</text>
  <text start="1311.84" dur="2.94">strong in the word we need to have the</text>
  <text start="1313.43" dur="3.09">word in our hearts and in our mind so</text>
  <text start="1314.78" dur="3.9">that we can discern things to start</text>
  <text start="1316.52" dur="4.05">between good and evil but what the</text>
  <text start="1318.68" dur="3.42">author saying here is that the people</text>
  <text start="1320.57" dur="3.66">he&amp;#39;s writing to they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="1322.1" dur="5.459">that level they&amp;#39;re not there yet and so</text>
  <text start="1324.23" dur="5.73">he&amp;#39;s having to show some very very basic</text>
  <text start="1327.559" dur="4.081">things and probably one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="1329.96" dur="3.45">is because in the first century there</text>
  <text start="1331.64" dur="3.57">was a lot of Gnosticism going around</text>
  <text start="1333.41" dur="3.81">which was attacking a very basic</text>
  <text start="1335.21" dur="3.57">doctrine saying that Jesus Yahshua</text>
  <text start="1337.22" dur="3.329">didn&amp;#39;t come in the flesh but he was just</text>
  <text start="1338.78" dur="3.45">some sort of spirit man that then</text>
  <text start="1340.549" dur="4.171">eventually I set it up into heaven which</text>
  <text start="1342.23" dur="3.96">totally strips away the whole essence of</text>
  <text start="1344.72" dur="3.72">one of the reasons he came which was</text>
  <text start="1346.19" dur="5.46">again to relate to us as a human so that</text>
  <text start="1348.44" dur="4.68">we could overcome sin in him so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1351.65" dur="4.159">the basic principle is he&amp;#39;s been going</text>
  <text start="1353.12" dur="8.07">over in the first five chapters here and</text>
  <text start="1355.809" dur="6.791">and we will stop there because that</text>
  <text start="1361.19" dur="2.94">Hebrew 6 will pick up with some of those</text>
  <text start="1362.6" dur="5.22">basic doctrines that we need to all</text>
  <text start="1364.13" dur="6.39">continue to explore and then beyond that</text>
  <text start="1367.82" dur="4.5">but we need to make sure that we we move</text>
  <text start="1370.52" dur="3.69">beyond the milk we move beyond the milk</text>
  <text start="1372.32" dur="3.69">which is simply you know recognizing</text>
  <text start="1374.21" dur="4.89">that Yahshua came to help us overcome</text>
  <text start="1376.01" dur="4.83">sin and as we recognize that and be</text>
  <text start="1379.1" dur="3.569">start becoming fathers and mothers in</text>
  <text start="1380.84" dur="4.17">the faith and understanding his word</text>
  <text start="1382.669" dur="4.411">then we will have the discernment the</text>
  <text start="1385.01" dur="3.96">sermon in situations discernment as we</text>
  <text start="1387.08" dur="3.329">live our lives to discern between good</text>
  <text start="1388.97" dur="3.18">and evil and to walk in the way of</text>
  <text start="1390.409" dur="4.77">righteousness that&amp;#39;s where we need to be</text>
