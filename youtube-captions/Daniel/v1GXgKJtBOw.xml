  <text start="27.029" dur="5.701">later today I have a somewhat of a sober</text>
  <text start="29.88" dur="4.679">teaching for this morning and this is</text>
  <text start="32.73" dur="3.36">based off one subscriber sending me an</text>
  <text start="34.559" dur="2.461">email about some information it&amp;#39;s for a</text>
  <text start="36.09" dur="2.64">job a memory</text>
  <text start="37.02" dur="5.1">I actually did a teaching about this</text>
  <text start="38.73" dur="5.64">very similar way back in 2013 but yeah</text>
  <text start="42.12" dur="4.41">prompted me to do an updated teaching on</text>
  <text start="44.37" dur="6">this and it&amp;#39;s about the Ark of the</text>
  <text start="46.53" dur="5.34">Covenant and I want to just start off</text>
  <text start="50.37" dur="3.869">before I even talk about the Ark of the</text>
  <text start="51.87" dur="9.239">Covenant I want to start off with</text>
  <text start="54.239" dur="9.361">Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 16 16 and this</text>
  <text start="61.109" dur="4.41">Jeremiah 3 is describing the time of the</text>
  <text start="63.6" dur="3.629">Millennial Kingdom when the Messiah is</text>
  <text start="65.519" dur="6.121">ruling and reigning for a thousand years</text>
  <text start="67.229" dur="7.261">as described in Zechariah 14 revelation</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="4.86">20 Malachi 3 the last four chapters of</text>
  <text start="74.49" dur="5.19">Ezekiel many other scriptures about</text>
  <text start="76.5" dur="4.86">Messiah Jesus Christ of Nazareth Yahshua</text>
  <text start="79.68" dur="3.54">ruling and reigning from Jerusalem for a</text>
  <text start="81.36" dur="3.899">thousand years and it says that during</text>
  <text start="83.22" dur="5.579">that time it says and it shall come to</text>
  <text start="85.259" dur="6.481">pass starting in verse 16 when you be</text>
  <text start="88.799" dur="5.191">multiplied to increase the land in those</text>
  <text start="91.74" dur="4.489">days saith Yahweh they shall say no more</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="4.589">the ark of the covenant of yahweh</text>
  <text start="96.229" dur="3.731">neither shall it come to mind neither</text>
  <text start="98.579" dur="3.9">shall they remember it neither shall</text>
  <text start="99.96" dur="3.75">they visit it neither shall that be done</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="3.691">any more</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="5.1">at that time they so called jerusalem</text>
  <text start="106.17" dur="4.47">the throne of Yahweh and all the nations</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="4.14">shall be gathered unto it to the name of</text>
  <text start="110.64" dur="4.259">Yahweh to Jerusalem neither shall they</text>
  <text start="112.95" dur="3.51">walk anymore after the imagination of</text>
  <text start="114.899" dur="4.051">their evil heart</text>
  <text start="116.46" dur="4.439">hallelujah so why is the Ark of the</text>
  <text start="118.95" dur="5.629">Covenant gonna be no longer remembered</text>
  <text start="120.899" dur="7.11">by the time the 1000 year reign begins</text>
  <text start="124.579" dur="5.8">well I&amp;#39;ll tell you why the Ark of the</text>
  <text start="128.009" dur="3.741">Covenant is currently buried beneath</text>
  <text start="130.379" dur="4.431">Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="131.75" dur="4.53">and it will be brought forth but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="134.81" dur="2.7">going to be brought forth to bring about</text>
  <text start="136.28" dur="4.11">a great delusion</text>
  <text start="137.51" dur="4.71">remember when Apostle Paul rabbi shul</text>
  <text start="140.39" dur="4.79">wrote that letter to the Thessalonians</text>
  <text start="142.22" dur="4.95">he said that in the last days that</text>
  <text start="145.18" dur="2.47">because they had not a love for the</text>
  <text start="147.17" dur="2.55">truth</text>
  <text start="147.65" dur="4.5">yaahh himself was gonna send a great</text>
  <text start="149.72" dur="3.87">delusion upon all those who have not a</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="5.1">love for the truth that they might</text>
  <text start="153.59" dur="5.369">believe a lie and Jesus himself Yahshua</text>
  <text start="157.25" dur="3.87">of Nazareth warned in the Gospels he</text>
  <text start="158.959" dur="4.771">said if were possible even the very</text>
  <text start="161.12" dur="3.36">elect would be deceived I&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="163.73" dur="2.52">about Ron Wyatt</text>
  <text start="164.48" dur="3.84">he started off really pure I mean he</text>
  <text start="166.25" dur="3.72">he&amp;#39;s the one that you know basically</text>
  <text start="168.32" dur="3.48">allows us now to have this video footage</text>
  <text start="169.97" dur="4.98">of the chariot wheels at the bottom of</text>
  <text start="171.8" dur="4.59">the Red Sea he discovered the preserved</text>
  <text start="174.95" dur="3.45">remains of Sodom and Gomorrah he</text>
  <text start="176.39" dur="4.2">discovered that the ark the actual</text>
  <text start="178.4" dur="5.339">Noah&amp;#39;s Ark of northeastern Turkey really</text>
  <text start="180.59" dur="6.54">started off pure however he did actually</text>
  <text start="183.739" dur="5.551">discover the Ark of the Covenant he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.13" dur="4.35">started going down deep into Jeremiah&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.29" dur="4.46">grotto there&amp;#39;s a whole lot of</text>
  <text start="191.48" dur="6.78">information about that that he puts out</text>
  <text start="193.75" dur="8.11">and and he was struck dead with multiple</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="4.979">brain tumors and the reason why is</text>
  <text start="201.86" dur="2.55">because he wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to do what he</text>
  <text start="203.239" dur="2.491">was doing he was supposed to go down</text>
  <text start="204.41" dur="3.18">there to the ark remember only a</text>
  <text start="205.73" dur="4.259">Levitical priest is allowed to touch the</text>
  <text start="207.59" dur="5.16">Ark of the Covenant but there&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="209.989" dur="4.461">something more important of why he</text>
  <text start="212.75" dur="4.23">wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to go where he was going</text>
  <text start="214.45" dur="5.17">this Ark of the Covenant will be brought</text>
  <text start="216.98" dur="6.36">forth it&amp;#39;s this artifact that they will</text>
  <text start="219.62" dur="5.61">bring forth and supposedly it&amp;#39;s supposed</text>
  <text start="223.34" dur="3.69">to bring any juice in the Messiah but</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="3.81">I&amp;#39;m telling you right now it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="4.41">be used as a great delusion to go to</text>
  <text start="229.04" dur="5.49">revelation 11 there is not a massive</text>
  <text start="231.44" dur="5.22">revival in Jerusalem until the</text>
  <text start="234.53" dur="4.769">resurrection until the two witnesses and</text>
  <text start="236.66" dur="4.44">the dead Messiah rise and those who are</text>
  <text start="239.299" dur="3.961">alive enduring get caught with them and</text>
  <text start="241.1" dur="4.08">that great earthquake basically kills</text>
  <text start="243.26" dur="5.13">7,000 people in Jerusalem and then the</text>
  <text start="245.18" dur="5.339">rest repent eternity ah they missed the</text>
  <text start="248.39" dur="4.11">resurrection but they repent and and</text>
  <text start="250.519" dur="8.611">paul r a bachelor efforts</text>
  <text start="252.5" dur="8.43">this in Romans 11 he said if if the</text>
  <text start="259.13" dur="3.78">falling away of the Jews be life to the</text>
  <text start="260.93" dur="4.26">Gentiles how much more will the horizon</text>
  <text start="262.91" dur="3.48">of a deadbeat in bringing forth the</text>
  <text start="265.19" dur="3.84">fullness of the Jews</text>
  <text start="266.39" dur="6.06">so this Ark of the Covenant will be</text>
  <text start="269.03" dur="7.86">brought forth and it is buried beneath</text>
  <text start="272.45" dur="6.42">Jerusalem and this Ark if you read about</text>
  <text start="276.89" dur="3.93">in the Torah you know it has those two</text>
  <text start="278.87" dur="4.95">cherubim and you probably seen it from</text>
  <text start="280.82" dur="4.44">Indiana Jones the two cherubim to face</text>
  <text start="283.82" dur="2.28">each other but there&amp;#39;s a mercy seat on</text>
  <text start="285.26" dur="3.48">this Ark</text>
  <text start="286.1" dur="4.8">and the son of perdition is basically</text>
  <text start="288.74" dur="4.8">going to be allowed to sit on this Ark</text>
  <text start="290.9" dur="6.71">and the son of perdition is going to</text>
  <text start="293.54" dur="6.69">have this amazing glory cloud upon him a</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="4.09">counterfeit glory cloud and he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="300.23" dur="4.89">be able to call down fire from the sky</text>
  <text start="301.7" dur="4.92">like Elijah the Prophet did and this Ark</text>
  <text start="305.12" dur="4.95">of the Covenant will be placed right</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="6.12">into the Holy of Holies of this temple</text>
  <text start="310.07" dur="5.45">and he&amp;#39;s gonna sit on it and everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.74" dur="6.06">gonna believe he is the Messiah everyone</text>
  <text start="315.52" dur="6.28">even many people who are in the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="318.8" dur="4.44">messianic movement that have lost their</text>
  <text start="321.8" dur="4.8">first love and they&amp;#39;ve gotten into</text>
  <text start="323.24" dur="5.84">Kabbalah or they they&amp;#39;re dead or</text>
  <text start="326.6" dur="5.04">whatever they&amp;#39;re in a counterfeit spirit</text>
  <text start="329.08" dur="4.99">even they will be deceived by the son of</text>
  <text start="331.64" dur="3.029">perdition as he sits on this Ark of the</text>
  <text start="334.07" dur="3.03">Covenant</text>
  <text start="334.669" dur="5.101">in fact tragically and sadly Michael</text>
  <text start="337.1" dur="5.04">Ruth who also started off pure way back</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="4.14">in the 90s early 2000s but then he</text>
  <text start="342.14" dur="3.21">started selling the gospel making</text>
  <text start="343.91" dur="3.81">merchandise of the gospel and basically</text>
  <text start="345.35" dur="4.129">no longer just receiving voluntary</text>
  <text start="347.72" dur="4.44">donations but actually charging money</text>
  <text start="349.479" dur="5.021">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s totally lost when he become a</text>
  <text start="352.16" dur="3.81">clown and he actually teaches that the</text>
  <text start="354.5" dur="3.51">Ark of the Covenant we brought forth to</text>
  <text start="355.97" dur="4.05">bring many Jews to to the Messiah</text>
  <text start="358.01" dur="6.96">because evidently the Messiah&amp;#39;s blood</text>
  <text start="360.02" dur="7.14">will be on the ark well that blood the</text>
  <text start="364.97" dur="4.44">chromosomes that will be on the ark will</text>
  <text start="367.16" dur="3.84">actually match the blood of the son of</text>
  <text start="369.41" dur="5.97">perdition as part of a great delusion</text>
  <text start="371" dur="6.479">and this is why in Jeremiah chapter 3 it</text>
  <text start="375.38" dur="4.11">says there&amp;#39;ll be no more remembrance of</text>
  <text start="377.479" dur="5.94">the Ark because this thing will be used</text>
  <text start="379.49" dur="5.37">as a complete and total abomination to</text>
  <text start="383.419" dur="10.231">help the great delusion</text>
  <text start="384.86" dur="13.5">the image of the beast a lot of people</text>
  <text start="393.65" dur="5.789">you know they look at this symbol and</text>
  <text start="398.36" dur="2.73">they think oh it&amp;#39;s the Star of David</text>
  <text start="399.439" dur="4.82">this is not the star David it&amp;#39;s the Star</text>
  <text start="401.09" dur="5.16">Trek film it&amp;#39;s a pagan satanic symbol</text>
  <text start="404.259" dur="4.12">capitalistic and nature has nothing to</text>
  <text start="406.25" dur="3.96">do with David the true symbol of Israel</text>
  <text start="408.379" dur="5.19">should be the seven-branched menorah</text>
  <text start="410.21" dur="7.049">that&amp;#39;s also drifter this thing is six</text>
  <text start="413.569" dur="6.66">points six little triangles and then six</text>
  <text start="417.259" dur="4.861">sides at six six six and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="420.229" dur="3.3">reason why Hitler use this to brand the</text>
  <text start="422.12" dur="3.15">Jews in the Holocaust because he was</text>
  <text start="423.529" dur="4.531">completely he was a foreshadow of the</text>
  <text start="425.27" dur="5.79">son of perdition so this is 666 and this</text>
  <text start="428.06" dur="4.859">is not this is not good and this will be</text>
  <text start="431.06" dur="4.199">involved in the mark of the beast in the</text>
  <text start="432.919" dur="4.62">image of the beast all this stuff and</text>
  <text start="435.259" dur="4.201">again this is why and Jeremiah three it</text>
  <text start="437.539" dur="4.231">says the ark will be remembered no more</text>
  <text start="439.46" dur="5.069">and during the Millennial Kingdom of</text>
  <text start="441.77" dur="4.829">course Yahshua the true yash of Nazareth</text>
  <text start="444.529" dur="3.931">he&amp;#39;ll return from the eastern sky with</text>
  <text start="446.599" dur="3.421">us will be resurrected and caught up to</text>
  <text start="448.46" dur="4.109">be with him at that seventh trumpet on</text>
  <text start="450.02" dur="4.41">yom teruah some yom teruah piece of</text>
  <text start="452.569" dur="3.871">trumpets in the future will be up with</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="3.12">him in the heavenlies and receive our</text>
  <text start="456.44" dur="3.149">awards on yom kippur</text>
  <text start="457.55" dur="3.6">and then we&amp;#39;ll have a marriage supper of</text>
  <text start="459.589" dur="3.75">the lamb during Sukkot the eight-day</text>
  <text start="461.15" dur="3.96">festival and then on that last great day</text>
  <text start="463.339" dur="3.661">will return with him as it says in</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="5.04">revelation 19 as it says in the book of</text>
  <text start="467" dur="4.71">Jude will return with him and with the</text>
  <text start="470.15" dur="3.06">brightness of his coming and the breath</text>
  <text start="471.71" dur="2.879">of his mouth he&amp;#39;ll destroy the wicked</text>
  <text start="473.21" dur="3.209">one and all the armies of the Beast and</text>
  <text start="474.589" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;ll throw the son of perdition and the</text>
  <text start="476.419" dur="3.331">Beast into the lake of fire and will</text>
  <text start="478.279" dur="3.63">return with him and then he will</text>
  <text start="479.75" dur="4.229">actually have a sanctified temple that</text>
  <text start="481.909" dur="4.56">he will be in and he will rule and reign</text>
  <text start="483.979" dur="4.56">in and David who&amp;#39;s been resurrected will</text>
  <text start="486.469" dur="3.211">be a prince there so that would be the</text>
  <text start="488.539" dur="3.66">true thing but this Ark of the Covenant</text>
  <text start="489.68" dur="5.639">will no longer be remembered yah show</text>
  <text start="492.199" dur="4.861">himself will be the Ark so so I just</text>
  <text start="495.319" dur="4.47">wanted to make this teaching again</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="5.24">because there&amp;#39;s a lot of deception out</text>
  <text start="499.789" dur="4.921">there and I just put it out as a warning</text>
  <text start="502.3" dur="4.479">this just shows that even if you get a</text>
  <text start="504.71" dur="4.62">lot of truth cuz Michael Rood and Ron</text>
  <text start="506.779" dur="4.86">Wyatt they had a lot of truth but if you</text>
  <text start="509.33" dur="4.259">start getting off if you lose your first</text>
  <text start="511.639" dur="4.881">love if you start doing things that are</text>
  <text start="513.589" dur="5.13">not of yah then even with all that truth</text>
  <text start="516.52" dur="3.85">you can still follow it</text>
  <text start="518.719" dur="3.99">because the most important thing is not</text>
  <text start="520.37" dur="4.199">to be puffed up with knowledge but to</text>
  <text start="522.709" dur="3.42">have that heart that says oh oh yah show</text>
  <text start="524.569" dur="3.601">I just want to love you and please you</text>
  <text start="526.129" dur="4.95">want to bring a smile to your heart that</text>
  <text start="528.17" dur="7.109">Philadelphian heart a heart after God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.079" dur="6.211">own because knowledge puffs up and love</text>
  <text start="535.279" dur="4.441">does rejoice in the truth truth is very</text>
  <text start="537.29" dur="5.58">very good you have to have truth but</text>
  <text start="539.72" dur="5.25">love is the principle matter and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.87" dur="4.17">what Michael root is lost and many in</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="4.559">the Messianic Hebrew movements have lost</text>
  <text start="547.04" dur="3.93">- they&amp;#39;ve lost their first love that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="549.529" dur="3.66">the two extremes always seen the</text>
  <text start="550.97" dur="3.75">Messianic movement either they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="553.189" dur="3.71">in at or out if they&amp;#39;ve completely lost</text>
  <text start="554.72" dur="5.039">their first love and so they&amp;#39;re dead or</text>
  <text start="556.899" dur="4.24">they&amp;#39;re late I seen where they say you</text>
  <text start="559.759" dur="3.031">don&amp;#39;t have to keep Torah you do whatever</text>
  <text start="561.139" dur="2.731">you want and they want to just be filled</text>
  <text start="562.79" dur="3.299">we gifts the spirit and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="563.87" dur="5.31">left in deception and they become you</text>
  <text start="566.089" dur="5.73">know Dominion people or Cara&amp;#39;s mania</text>
  <text start="569.18" dur="4.079">wicked or just lukewarm those are the</text>
  <text start="571.819" dur="4.77">two extremes and the Messianic Kira</text>
