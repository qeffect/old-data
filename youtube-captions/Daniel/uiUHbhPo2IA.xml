  <text start="3.81" dur="4.23">Monday night October 30th now the</text>
  <text start="6.089" dur="4.111">beginning of the eleventh day of the</text>
  <text start="8.04" dur="4.62">eighth Hebrew month and I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="10.2" dur="5.999">share a testimony I just got finished</text>
  <text start="12.66" dur="5.43">with the Jim because as my my practices</text>
  <text start="16.199" dur="3.33">I work from 8:00 to 5:00 and then I go</text>
  <text start="18.09" dur="4.349">straight to the gym and I do some</text>
  <text start="19.529" dur="4.41">swimming but I was in the sauna and as I</text>
  <text start="22.439" dur="4.441">was in the sauna there was this Chinese</text>
  <text start="23.939" dur="5.311">Asian woman talking with this guy about</text>
  <text start="26.88" dur="4.409">Christianity and I happen to mention</text>
  <text start="29.25" dur="3.6">that I was a messianic that I believe</text>
  <text start="31.289" dur="4.02">that we still should keep Torah out of a</text>
  <text start="32.85" dur="4.709">love for Yahshua well she began to ask</text>
  <text start="35.309" dur="3.66">me one question after another about my</text>
  <text start="37.559" dur="3.901">beliefs and I explained to her very</text>
  <text start="38.969" dur="4.68">clearly you know Matthew five were you</text>
  <text start="41.46" dur="3.869">know Jesus Yahshua said I come not to</text>
  <text start="43.649" dur="3.39">abolish the Torah but I come to show you</text>
  <text start="45.329" dur="4.111">how to properly obey it out of a heart</text>
  <text start="47.039" dur="4.561">of love and I began to answer a question</text>
  <text start="49.44" dur="4.139">she got really agitated because she was</text>
  <text start="51.6" dur="4.889">this Christian that she basically</text>
  <text start="53.579" dur="4.561">believed that Yahshua shed his blood so</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="3">that she would no longer have to do the</text>
  <text start="58.14" dur="3.809">tour that she was set free from it</text>
  <text start="59.489" dur="3.991">because He fulfilled it right so as I</text>
  <text start="61.949" dur="4.111">began to press more and more about what</text>
  <text start="63.48" dur="5.249">Hebrews 8 meant and what Jeremiah 31 and</text>
  <text start="66.06" dur="5.28">Matthew five and I showed that know if</text>
  <text start="68.729" dur="4.951">you use the blood of Jesus of Yahshua to</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="4.26">justify rebellion to the Torah you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="73.68" dur="3.78">actually using his sacrifice to do the</text>
  <text start="75.6" dur="3.69">very opposite of what the gospel teaches</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="5.04">that the gospel teaches very clearly</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="5.04">that He shed his blood and died and rose</text>
  <text start="82.5" dur="4.229">again so that we would have the power to</text>
  <text start="84.33" dur="3.81">obey his Torah and to obey it perfectly</text>
  <text start="86.729" dur="4.231">out of a love for him that he gives us</text>
  <text start="88.14" dur="4.56">an inward desire to obey every single</text>
  <text start="90.96" dur="4.56">law and tour that&amp;#39;s possible to be kept</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="4.739">in our modern day culture well she got</text>
  <text start="95.52" dur="3.36">really upset and I kept pressing it and</text>
  <text start="97.439" dur="3.451">pressing it and there about eight or</text>
  <text start="98.88" dur="3.87">nine of the people in the sauna and she</text>
  <text start="100.89" dur="3.57">finally got so upset she raced out of</text>
  <text start="102.75" dur="3.96">the sauna room and all every single</text>
  <text start="104.46" dur="4.71">person raced out as well well then the</text>
  <text start="106.71" dur="4.11">manager comes into the sauna and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="3">like hey I just got three complaints and</text>
  <text start="110.82" dur="3.36">you can&amp;#39;t be doing this and I said look</text>
  <text start="112.17" dur="4.08">she asks me questions I just was</text>
  <text start="114.18" dur="3.39">answering and he said well if someone</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="3">asks you questions you need to just tell</text>
  <text start="117.57" dur="3.18">them that you&amp;#39;ll answer it outside</text>
  <text start="119.25" dur="3.57">because I can&amp;#39;t have this you offended</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="3.719">so many people it&amp;#39;s like okay well as</text>
  <text start="122.82" dur="3.149">soon as he left another guy sitting next</text>
  <text start="124.469" dur="3.091">to me a younger guy kind of looked like</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="4.561">a younger version of Matthew McConaughey</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="4.56">the actor he started saying well why was</text>
  <text start="130.53" dur="2.19">she oh so upset so then he started</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="2.4">asking me</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="3.99">about my testimony so I started sharing</text>
  <text start="134.52" dur="4.56">with them again about Torah about how</text>
  <text start="136.71" dur="5.31">the New Testaments about you know loving</text>
  <text start="139.08" dur="4.5">him and and then he said will sum up</text>
  <text start="142.02" dur="4.14">your religion in like a couple sentences</text>
  <text start="143.58" dur="4.2">and I said well the unique thing about</text>
  <text start="146.16" dur="3.72">what I believe is that it&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="147.78" dur="3.84">religion in the world when you</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="4.59">completely surrender your heart to yasho</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="4.29">to Jesus and you obey Him through his</text>
  <text start="154.47" dur="3.24">spirit it&amp;#39;s the only original world that</text>

  <text start="161.7" dur="3.18">beings are either righteous or wicked</text>
  <text start="163.11" dur="2.94">and the only way to be righteous is to</text>
  <text start="164.88" dur="2.61">completely surrender your heart to</text>
  <text start="166.05" dur="2.55">yahushua to be covered by his blood to</text>
  <text start="167.49" dur="3.69">be filled with the spirit and to start</text>
  <text start="168.6" dur="3.99">obeying his word his Torah well he had a</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="2.46">big problem with that because he was one</text>
