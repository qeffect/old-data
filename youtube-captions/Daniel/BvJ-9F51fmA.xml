  <text start="0" dur="8.849">we talked in the past about how Yeshua</text>
  <text start="4.02" dur="8.67">Yeshua Messiah is equivalent to the</text>
  <text start="8.849" dur="7.251">Torah and vice versa he&amp;#39;s the foreign</text>
  <text start="12.69" dur="7.02">aid in flesh so what I wanted to do was</text>
  <text start="16.1" dur="6.49">the most important thing when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="19.71" dur="5.61">studying the scriptures is to see how</text>
  <text start="22.59" dur="6.06">the Messiah or vittoria is at the center</text>
  <text start="25.32" dur="5.73">of the scriptures you know because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="28.65" dur="5.28">all about him so I thought it would be a</text>
  <text start="31.05" dur="5.55">good study to go through all 66 books of</text>
  <text start="33.93" dur="5.76">the Bible and drop the theme of each</text>
  <text start="36.6" dur="11.67">book and not reflects inside and the</text>
  <text start="39.69" dur="14.099">tour so the first one app is Genesis and</text>
  <text start="48.27" dur="13.08">the theme of that is he is the seed seed</text>
  <text start="53.789" dur="17.01">of a woman who will crush the head of</text>
  <text start="61.35" dur="10.71">the sink I&amp;#39;ll just Nick and of course we</text>
  <text start="70.799" dur="2.971">see that at the very beginning of</text>
  <text start="72.06" dur="4.41">Genesis and it&amp;#39;s kind of it&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="73.77" dur="4.65">theme through the entire book that this</text>
  <text start="76.47" dur="4.23">is the first kind of prophecy was given</text>
  <text start="78.42" dur="4.379">but it&amp;#39;s all pointing toward the Messiah</text>
  <text start="80.7" dur="3.84">who eventually fulfills this when he of</text>
  <text start="82.799" dur="4.651">course was crucified and resurrected</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="4.95">days and three nights later because he</text>
  <text start="87.45" dur="6.15">of course comes from the seed of the</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="6.12">woman Messiah from Mary Miriam and he of</text>
  <text start="93.6" dur="4.48">course crushes the head of the upper</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="4.57">servant and and you know we see this</text>
  <text start="98.08" dur="3.81">this is the first kind of Messianic</text>
  <text start="100.18" dur="3.9">prophecies given and all the trickery of</text>
  <text start="101.89" dur="5.46">you kind of see this all through all its</text>
  <text start="104.08" dur="4.83">the Bible but the gist is definitely the</text>
  <text start="107.35" dur="5.55">theme of Genesis and prostatic so she</text>
  <text start="108.91" dur="7.2">can give you that&amp;#39;s where Messiah sort</text>
  <text start="112.9" dur="7.56">of happy okay when we go to Exodus</text>
  <text start="116.11" dur="6.57">Exodus is a Exodus is kind of pretty</text>
  <text start="120.46" dur="5.37">easy and you probably all have guessed</text>

  <text start="246.27" dur="5.16">this whole new book that that all of a</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="5.64">sudden has all this relevance to your</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="15.44">life so I think I shall be music so now</text>
  <text start="255.57" dur="22.44">we go to numbers and in numbers he casts</text>
  <text start="266.87" dur="12.94">down Baylor and guards his people so if</text>
  <text start="278.01" dur="3.45">you remember in the book of numbers you</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="5.34">have a story about palin and how he was</text>
  <text start="281.46" dur="5.82">in first israel and he was hired by a</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="3.42">pagan King to curse Israel and every</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="1.94">time he would try to curse Israel he</text>
  <text start="288.57" dur="6.35">wasn&amp;#39;t able</text>
  <text start="289.22" dur="7.89">blessed Israel and and so being that you</text>
  <text start="294.92" dur="4.62">see in numbers as how y&amp;#39;all for Texas</text>
  <text start="297.11" dur="5.22">people he cast down Balin with comments</text>
  <text start="299.54" dur="5.4">and he gardens people returns this</text>

  <text start="304.94" dur="4.95">King gets mad at bail and everything but</text>
  <text start="307.88" dur="3.75">we see that in the book of Book of</text>
  <text start="309.89" dur="10.44">Numbers people Texas and he passed down</text>
  <text start="311.63" dur="11.36">my name&amp;#39;s new tirana me which effect</text>
  <text start="320.33" dur="5.22">essentially Deuteronomy is kind of a</text>
  <text start="322.99" dur="4.15">retelling of the Torah it&amp;#39;s Moses kind</text>
  <text start="325.55" dur="5.01">of giving the Torah again a second time</text>
  <text start="327.14" dur="7.17">as a second miss Anna Deuteronomy he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.56" dur="6.63">the one who declares that this Torah is</text>
  <text start="334.31" dur="6.63">very near you in your mouth and in your</text>
  <text start="337.19" dur="9.18">heart that you may do it and that is</text>
  <text start="340.94" dur="6.99">from Deuteronomy 30 first 14 I always</text>
  <text start="346.37" dur="3">think the Deuteronomy 30 is kind of the</text>
  <text start="347.93" dur="3.42">capstone of the entire book of</text>
  <text start="349.37" dur="4.35">Deuteronomy because if you remember</text>
  <text start="351.35" dur="4.71">during the 30s the scripture where it</text>
  <text start="353.72" dur="4.5">says are you going to say that the tour</text>
  <text start="356.06" dur="3.42">is way up in the sky and who&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="358.22" dur="3.36">bring it down to us are you going to say</text>
  <text start="359.48" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s way over the ocean is in regular no</text>
  <text start="361.58" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s right next to its in your heart in</text>
  <text start="364.22" dur="6.42">your mouth you may do it and Paul quotes</text>
  <text start="367.07" dur="5.01">this in Romans 10 okay so I always I</text>
  <text start="370.64" dur="3.66">always looking to round 830 a sort of</text>
  <text start="372.08" dur="4.05">the capstone of Deuteronomy and really I</text>
  <text start="374.3" dur="3.81">think what&amp;#39;s important about this is you</text>
  <text start="376.13" dur="3.78">know as Christians and maybe even as</text>
  <text start="378.11" dur="3.93">many annex we kind of have this mindset</text>
  <text start="379.91" dur="3.99">of oh you know we can never keep the</text>
  <text start="382.04" dur="3.84">Torah it&amp;#39;s too hard it&amp;#39;s too difficult</text>
  <text start="383.9" dur="3.63">no one can do it praise Jesus we have</text>
  <text start="385.88" dur="3.66">his blood you know that&amp;#39;s kind of an</text>
  <text start="387.53" dur="3.96">Italian you fall into but Deuteronomy</text>
  <text start="389.54" dur="4.02">says that no that&amp;#39;s not the case that</text>
  <text start="391.49" dur="4.35">the Torah is in your heart it&amp;#39;s in your</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="4.74">mind you can do these things and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="395.84" dur="4.47">here to help you do them so from</text>
  <text start="398.3" dur="3.48">Deuteronomy we learn it through Messiah</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="4.71">30 so we</text>
  <text start="401.78" dur="9.139">and obey his commands and that i believe</text>
  <text start="405.02" dur="9.33">is is is the good news okay so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.919" dur="11.521">that&amp;#39;s the Torah it&amp;#39;s the first five</text>
  <text start="414.35" dur="18.63">books only 61 more books to go all right</text>
  <text start="422.44" dur="16.72">in Joshua in Joshua he is the captain of</text>
  <text start="432.98" dur="7.86">our salvation and what does he do he</text>
  <text start="439.16" dur="4.259">leads us into the Promised Land of</text>

  <text start="450.41" dur="5.31">the vision our latest conquer one nation</text>
  <text start="453.53" dur="5.25">after another and he is the one who</text>
  <text start="455.72" dur="5.04">leads us into the Promised Land that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.78" dur="4.35">what Josh was about and that&amp;#39;s what God</text>
  <text start="460.76" dur="4.62">showed us cross he leads us into the</text>
  <text start="463.13" dur="7.43">Promised Land we allow him to deliver</text>
