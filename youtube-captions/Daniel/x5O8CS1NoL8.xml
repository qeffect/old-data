  <text start="3.06" dur="5.07">with tour restoration ministries this is</text>
  <text start="5.4" dur="6.239">being recorded on the afternoon of</text>
  <text start="8.13" dur="7.589">August the 9 2014 it is the 13th day of</text>
  <text start="11.639" dur="6.9">off of the 5th hebrew month and as we</text>
  <text start="15.719" dur="6.991">were going through our torah reading</text>
  <text start="18.539" dur="7.65">today for the Sabbath part of that Torah</text>
  <text start="22.71" dur="7.559">portion mm covered a verse that I wanted</text>
  <text start="26.189" dur="7.291">to make a podcast about because this</text>
  <text start="30.269" dur="7.981">verse so flies in the face of what a lot</text>
  <text start="33.48" dur="7.259">of modern day churches will teach but it</text>
  <text start="38.25" dur="7.17">is actually very scriptural it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="40.739" dur="7.89">Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 25 Moses is</text>
  <text start="45.42" dur="4.77">sort of rehashing everything that the</text>
  <text start="48.629" dur="3.871">Israelites had gone through for the past</text>
  <text start="50.19" dur="3.779">40 years they&amp;#39;re just on the verge of</text>
  <text start="52.5" dur="3.93">crossing the Jordan going into the</text>
  <text start="53.969" dur="4.14">Promised Land he&amp;#39;s going over the</text>
  <text start="56.43" dur="3">history what they went through and how</text>
  <text start="58.109" dur="4.651">they received the tour in all these</text>
  <text start="59.43" dur="6.57">Commandments and in Deuteronomy 6 25 it</text>
  <text start="62.76" dur="5.31">says actually I&amp;#39;ll start in verse 24</text>
  <text start="66" dur="5.13">just before that says in Yahweh</text>
  <text start="68.07" dur="5.159">commanded us to do all these statutes to</text>
  <text start="71.13" dur="3.75">fear Yahweh our elohim for our good</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="4.951">always that he might preserve us alive</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="7.86">as it is at this day and the verse 25</text>
  <text start="78.18" dur="6.45">and it shall be our righteousness if we</text>
  <text start="82.74" dur="5.04">observe to do all these commandments</text>
  <text start="84.63" dur="6.9">before Yahweh Elohim as he had commanded</text>
  <text start="87.78" dur="5.339">us that verse really strikes me because</text>
  <text start="91.53" dur="6.81">it really flies in the face of our</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="9.721">Laodicean cheap grace gospel that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="98.34" dur="6.93">that&amp;#39;s being taught today and it the the</text>
  <text start="102.84" dur="4.889">law the torah these commandments shall</text>
  <text start="105.27" dur="4.41">be our righteousness if we observe do</text>
  <text start="107.729" dur="5.131">all these commandments before Yahweh</text>
  <text start="109.68" dur="5.61">Elohim as you have commanded us so this</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="5.939">verse is clearly saying that the Torah</text>
  <text start="115.29" dur="6.149">the law these commandments that they</text>
  <text start="118.799" dur="6.301">will be a righteousness if we do them if</text>
  <text start="121.439" dur="7.111">we do them just as yah has told us to do</text>
  <text start="125.1" dur="5.579">them now you contrast that with the</text>
  <text start="128.55" dur="3.54">gospel that&amp;#39;s taught today which i</text>
  <text start="130.679" dur="2.031">believe is another gospel it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="2.96">accursed</text>
  <text start="132.71" dur="5.7">possible and that is well Jesus Christ</text>
  <text start="135.05" dur="4.88">is our righteousness so he obeyed all</text>
  <text start="138.41" dur="4.17">this law so we don&amp;#39;t have to do it</text>
  <text start="139.93" dur="6.94">that&amp;#39;s exactly the opposite of what this</text>
  <text start="142.58" dur="7.94">Deuteronomy 626 teaches now I do not</text>
  <text start="146.87" dur="7.11">believe that the so-called Old Testament</text>
  <text start="150.52" dur="5.8">connor dicks or opposes the so-called</text>
  <text start="153.98" dur="6.5">New Testament I believe that the entire</text>
  <text start="156.32" dur="7.77">Bible works together in one harmonious</text>
  <text start="160.48" dur="6.76">unified whole so if i see this principle</text>
  <text start="164.09" dur="5.88">outlined in Deuteronomy 6 25 that</text>
  <text start="167.24" dur="4.44">clearly says if we do the law if we do</text>
  <text start="169.97" dur="3.39">the Torah it will be our righteousness</text>
  <text start="171.68" dur="4.02">if we observe to do all these</text>
  <text start="173.36" dur="4.08">Commandments the statues before yacht it</text>
  <text start="175.7" dur="4.95">will be our righteous I should see that</text>
  <text start="177.44" dur="5.73">principle in the Gospels and in the in</text>
  <text start="180.65" dur="8.01">the in the New Testament and sure enough</text>
  <text start="183.17" dur="8.93">if you go to Luke chapter 6 in verse 46</text>
  <text start="188.66" dur="6.06">this is where Jesus Christ Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="192.1" dur="5.71">rebuking his disciples and he says why</text>
  <text start="194.72" dur="5.78">do you call me Lord Lord and do not the</text>
  <text start="197.81" dur="4.89">things which I say see right here</text>
  <text start="200.5" dur="3.91">Yahshua is operating off of this</text>
  <text start="202.7" dur="5.85">principle that&amp;#39;s being established in</text>
  <text start="204.41" dur="7.47">Deuteronomy 6 25 you cannot say that you</text>
  <text start="208.55" dur="5.61">love young that you are walking in his</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="4.94">righteousness if you&amp;#39;re not doing the</text>
  <text start="214.16" dur="6.87">very things that he&amp;#39;s commanded us to do</text>
  <text start="216.82" dur="5.41">and if you don&amp;#39;t believe me on that or</text>
  <text start="221.03" dur="5.61">if that&amp;#39;s not enough for you you can</text>
  <text start="222.23" dur="8.31">also go to John chapter 14 and starting</text>
  <text start="226.64" dur="6.63">in verse 23 John 14 23 were Yahshua</text>
  <text start="230.54" dur="6.09">answers his disciple he said unto him if</text>
  <text start="233.27" dur="6.15">a man loves me he will keep my words and</text>
  <text start="236.63" dur="6.72">my father will love him and we will come</text>
  <text start="239.42" dur="6.6">unto him and make our abode with him he</text>
  <text start="243.35" dur="4.95">that loves me not keeps not my sayings</text>
  <text start="246.02" dur="5.07">and the word which you hear is not mine</text>
  <text start="248.3" dur="5.85">but the fathers were sent sent me so</text>
  <text start="251.09" dur="4.95">again he&amp;#39;s saying look if you love me if</text>
  <text start="254.15" dur="3.18">you truly love me you&amp;#39;re going to do the</text>
  <text start="256.04" dur="3.78">things I&amp;#39;ve told you to do you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="257.33" dur="5.28">to keep my Commandments you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="259.82" dur="4.95">obey the instructions that I&amp;#39;ve given</text>
  <text start="262.61" dur="3.63">you and what are the words of Jesus</text>
  <text start="264.77" dur="4.23">Christ of Nazareth</text>
  <text start="266.24" dur="5.22">what are the commandments what are the</text>
  <text start="269" dur="5.22">things that he&amp;#39;s told to do well we see</text>
  <text start="271.46" dur="5.16">those things outlined in the Torah okay</text>
  <text start="274.22" dur="5.009">we see that the the Ten Commandments are</text>
  <text start="276.62" dur="5.03">given like keeping the Sabbath day we</text>
  <text start="279.229" dur="5.25">see all the statues and judgments and</text>
  <text start="281.65" dur="6.85">instructions that he&amp;#39;s given us in the</text>
  <text start="284.479" dur="7.141">Torah and that Yahshua confirms in the</text>
  <text start="288.5" dur="5.49">New Testament namely to love God with</text>
  <text start="291.62" dur="4.889">all our heart soul mind and strength to</text>
  <text start="293.99" dur="4.29">love our neighbor as ourselves and if we</text>
  <text start="296.509" dur="3.06">do those two things of course then we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="298.28" dur="2.639">going to want to do all these other</text>
  <text start="299.569" dur="4.35">Commandments and statutes and judgments</text>
  <text start="300.919" dur="6.24">as well because keeping the Sabbath day</text>
  <text start="303.919" dur="4.411">and wearing the ZZ and eating kosher and</text>
  <text start="307.159" dur="3.061">all these are the commandments and</text>
  <text start="308.33" dur="6">statutes that we find in the Torah all</text>
  <text start="310.22" dur="7.02">they do is bring us closer to yacht help</text>
  <text start="314.33" dur="5.22">us to serve our fellow man and it</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="4.26">actually it blesses us as well it</text>
  <text start="319.55" dur="4.619">sanctifies and blesses us and keeps us</text>
  <text start="321.5" dur="5.789">healthy and helps us in many many</text>
  <text start="324.169" dur="5.161">different ways so again this is this is</text>
  <text start="327.289" dur="4.831">very different from the modern day</text>
  <text start="329.33" dur="5.459">sloppy agape gospel that&amp;#39;s being taught</text>
  <text start="332.12" dur="5.01">today even by you know I would say even</text>
  <text start="334.789" dur="4.021">by well-meaning Christians okay so what</text>
  <text start="337.13" dur="3.36">I mean by that are people who know they</text>
  <text start="338.81" dur="3.24">genuinely have pure hearts they love God</text>
  <text start="340.49" dur="4.32">but they&amp;#39;re not teaching exactly what</text>
  <text start="342.05" dur="5.609">the scripture says and that is you know</text>
  <text start="344.81" dur="5.49">the false gospel of saying well jesus is</text>
  <text start="347.659" dur="4.621">our righteousness so you know we can we</text>
  <text start="350.3" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t have to obey His commandments we</text>
  <text start="352.28" dur="3.93">can sort of live any way we want and</text>
  <text start="354.5" dur="4.259">that&amp;#39;s not what the gospel is the true</text>
  <text start="356.21" dur="4.38">gospel is we keep his Commandments</text>
  <text start="358.759" dur="5.041">because we love him and then when we</text>
  <text start="360.59" dur="6.15">love him he is able to abide within us</text>
  <text start="363.8" dur="5.76">he he gives us actually he gives us when</text>
  <text start="366.74" dur="5.97">he lives within us he gives us the love</text>
  <text start="369.56" dur="4.979">we need to walk in his ways to walk in</text>
  <text start="372.71" dur="4.859">His commandments to do the things he</text>
  <text start="374.539" dur="5.791">wants us to do so we&amp;#39;re not establishing</text>
  <text start="377.569" dur="4.65">our own righteousness but we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="380.33" dur="4.95">his words we&amp;#39;re walking in his</text>
  <text start="382.219" dur="5.551">Commandments so that his Torah his law</text>
  <text start="385.28" dur="5.669">he himself the author of the Torah</text>
  <text start="387.77" dur="5.16">Yahshua you know we know that from</text>
  <text start="390.949" dur="4.681">Romans chapter 10 that Yahshua is the</text>
  <text start="392.93" dur="5.729">end or the Telos the goal of the Torah</text>
  <text start="395.63" dur="3.7">he is our righteousness although we have</text>
  <text start="398.659" dur="2.141">to we</text>
  <text start="399.33" dur="3.299">to understand what that actually means</text>
  <text start="400.8" dur="5.22">it means we cannot in other words we</text>
  <text start="402.629" dur="5.85">can&amp;#39;t separate loving Yahshua and and</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="4.829">and having his righteousness with in our</text>
  <text start="408.479" dur="5.521">lives we can&amp;#39;t separate that from doing</text>
  <text start="410.849" dur="6.09">the things he&amp;#39;s told us to do you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="414" dur="4.83">separate those two concepts they work</text>
  <text start="416.939" dur="5.19">hand in hand it&amp;#39;s like faith without</text>
  <text start="418.83" dur="6.329">works is dead you know you can&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="422.129" dur="4.59">faith that lack any works and the works</text>
  <text start="425.159" dur="4.23">what are the works and the works are</text>
  <text start="426.719" dur="4.711">walking in his Commandments doing his</text>
  <text start="429.389" dur="4.801">instructions doing the things he&amp;#39;s told</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="5.22">us to do how do we do that well we have</text>
  <text start="434.19" dur="4.05">to read his word we have to pray and we</text>
  <text start="436.65" dur="3.72">have to understand what is word of</text>
  <text start="438.24" dur="4.169">saying and then we have to implement</text>
  <text start="440.37" dur="4.32">that word in our lives even if it means</text>
  <text start="442.409" dur="4.171">you know that initially it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="444.69" dur="4.05">inconvenient or it might disrupt our</text>
  <text start="446.58" dur="3.209">lifestyles or you know might you know</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="3.09">you might have to go to your boss and</text>
  <text start="449.789" dur="4.291">say well I can&amp;#39;t work on Saturdays or</text>
  <text start="451.83" dur="3.78">you know people might look at you weird</text>
  <text start="454.08" dur="5.699">because you&amp;#39;re wearing as easy or</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="6.63">whatever but you have to conform your</text>
  <text start="459.779" dur="4.44">life to what the Scriptures teach what</text>
  <text start="462.24" dur="5.039">they what they say because again this</text>
  <text start="464.219" dur="6.241">isn&amp;#39;t about what what&amp;#39;s comfortable for</text>
  <text start="467.279" dur="5.82">you it&amp;#39;s about you making the choice I&amp;#39;m</text>
