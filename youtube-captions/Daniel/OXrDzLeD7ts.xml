  <text start="15.929" dur="7.801">in the fog and in the brain which I love</text>
  <text start="20.119" dur="5.351">this is from numbers 29 it talks about</text>
  <text start="23.73" dur="5.61">all the different sacrifices that are</text>
  <text start="25.47" dur="6.12">done during the fall feasts and there</text>

  <text start="31.59" dur="4.32">are the fall feasts of yah the spring</text>
  <text start="33.57" dur="3.75">feasts Messiah fulfilled because if you</text>
  <text start="35.91" dur="3.84">go through all the Torah and the</text>
  <text start="37.32" dur="4.829">prophets there are two images of the</text>
  <text start="39.75" dur="4.68">Messiah there&amp;#39;s the suffering servant</text>
  <text start="42.149" dur="4.64">that we read about in Psalm 22 and</text>
  <text start="44.43" dur="4.68">Isaiah 53 and numerous other scriptures</text>
  <text start="46.789" dur="3.641">that was the first picture of the</text>
  <text start="49.11" dur="4.5">Messiah the second one was him as a</text>
  <text start="50.43" dur="5.07">ruling and reigning king and of course</text>
  <text start="53.61" dur="3.51">he fulfilled that first image when he</text>
  <text start="55.5" dur="4.199">came to the earth two thousand years ago</text>
  <text start="57.12" dur="4.619">he fulfilled the spring feasts which we</text>
  <text start="59.699" dur="4.29">continue to celebrate to this day as we</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="4.2">look back on what Messiah did so he</text>
  <text start="63.989" dur="4.56">fulfilled those spring feasts Passover</text>
  <text start="65.939" dur="4.231">where he was crucified as the Passover</text>
  <text start="68.549" dur="2.011">lamb unleavened bread where he was</text>
  <text start="70.17" dur="2.73">buried</text>
  <text start="70.56" dur="3.9">firstfruits where he resurrected and was</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="3.81">the firstfruits for among the dead and</text>

  <text start="78.509" dur="4.801">early disciples he fulfilled all of</text>
  <text start="80.49" dur="4.44">those spring feasts 2,000 years ago and</text>
  <text start="83.31" dur="3.72">we continue to celebrate them looking</text>
  <text start="84.93" dur="5.009">back on this beautiful plan of salvation</text>
  <text start="87.03" dur="4.89">that the Messiah mapped out for us but</text>
  <text start="89.939" dur="3.661">the fall feasts that are continued to be</text>
  <text start="91.92" dur="5.04">celebrated as well they have not yet</text>
  <text start="93.6" dur="4.89">been fulfilled and they will be when me</text>
  <text start="96.96" dur="3.269">comes the second time as a ruling and</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="4.47">reigning king so I wanted to talk about</text>
  <text start="100.229" dur="5.311">Numbers chapter 29 because it specifies</text>
  <text start="102.96" dur="4.38">the different sacrifices done for all of</text>
  <text start="105.54" dur="4.05">those fall feasts but I wanted to zero</text>

  <text start="166.94" dur="4.68">known as Yom Kippur or the Day of</text>
  <text start="169.76" dur="4.32">Atonement which is a day of fasting and</text>

  <text start="174.08" dur="6.74">chapter 29 same thing there are 10</text>
  <text start="177.7" dur="7.42">offerings that are made on Yom Kippur</text>

  <text start="274.6" dur="5.58">where is your sting o grave where is</text>
  <text start="276.46" dur="5.459">your victory and he goes on and on so of</text>
  <text start="280.18" dur="3.66">course when Paul writes about that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="281.919" dur="5.601">directly referring to this other passage</text>
  <text start="283.84" dur="5.76">at first s loadings for where he says</text>

  <text start="295.87" dur="5.28">no hope for who believed that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="298.479" dur="6">Jesus died and rose again even so them</text>
  <text start="301.15" dur="5.55">also which are dead in Messiah Yahshua</text>

  <text start="330.07" dur="5.819">Yahshua in the air and so shall we ever</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="5.25">be with the Messiah so this is what the</text>
  <text start="335.889" dur="4.681">mystery is is talking about when when</text>
  <text start="337.75" dur="5.43">John pens this in Revelation 10 in the</text>
  <text start="340.57" dur="4.23">days of the seventh trumpet when he</text>
  <text start="343.18" dur="3.78">shall begin to sound with that seventh</text>
  <text start="344.8" dur="3.78">trumpet sounds the mystery of yah should</text>
  <text start="346.96" dur="4.769">be finished and we get confirmation</text>
  <text start="348.58" dur="4.92">revelation 11 because we read about the</text>
  <text start="351.729" dur="3.031">two witnesses who they know the two</text>
  <text start="353.5" dur="4.02">witnesses preached for three and a half</text>
  <text start="354.76" dur="4.77">years then they are murdered by the son</text>
  <text start="357.52" dur="4.11">of perdition and their streets are</text>
  <text start="359.53" dur="3.6">assuming their bodies are laid out in</text>
  <text start="361.63" dur="3.09">the streets of Jerusalem for three and a</text>
  <text start="363.13" dur="3.39">half days and after that thirty-nine</text>
  <text start="364.72" dur="3.629">days they suddenly rise up they have a</text>
  <text start="366.52" dur="3.72">resurrection this is the seventh trumpet</text>
  <text start="368.349" dur="4.32">resurrection in the days of the seventh</text>
  <text start="370.24" dur="4.32">trumpet the the dead and Messiah rise up</text>
  <text start="372.669" dur="4.171">first so these two witnesses rise up all</text>
  <text start="374.56" dur="4.289">the dead Messiah who died over the past</text>
  <text start="376.84" dur="3.66">two thousand year six thousand years</text>
  <text start="378.849" dur="3.841">whether they were looking forward to the</text>
  <text start="380.5" dur="4.229">Messiah or back of Messiah they also</text>
  <text start="382.69" dur="3.36">rise up from their graves and then we</text>
  <text start="384.729" dur="4.401">who are alive on man get caught up this</text>
  <text start="386.05" dur="5.76">is a public resurrection not some hidden</text>
  <text start="389.13" dur="3.87">pre-tribulation hoax this happens right</text>
  <text start="391.81" dur="4.61">toward the end of the great</text>
  <text start="393" dur="5.22">tribulation in the days of the seventh</text>
  <text start="396.42" dur="4.16">trumpet so these are the days of the</text>
  <text start="398.22" dur="5.61">seventh trumpet on some future year</text>
  <text start="400.58" dur="5.71">you&amp;#39;ll have the Feast of Trumpets where</text>
  <text start="403.83" dur="5.75">the seventh and final Trump will blast</text>
  <text start="406.29" dur="6.06">and in the days of the seventh trumpet</text>
  <text start="409.58" dur="4.12">which we celebrate every year as the ten</text>
  <text start="412.35" dur="3.48">days of all these are the days of the</text>
  <text start="413.7" dur="5.1">seventh trumpet so at some future year</text>
  <text start="415.83" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;ll never know the day or the hour of</text>
  <text start="418.8" dur="3.6">this what the Christians call the</text>
  <text start="420.96" dur="2.46">rapture to the resurrection actually</text>
  <text start="422.4" dur="2.55">we&amp;#39;ll never know the day or the hour</text>
  <text start="423.42" dur="6.84">because you can always happen anytime in</text>
  <text start="424.95" dur="6.87">the days of the seventh trumpet so this</text>
  <text start="430.26" dur="5.88">is when the resurrection occurs on some</text>
  <text start="431.82" dur="6.39">future year I believe it&amp;#39;ll be 2027 but</text>
  <text start="436.14" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s because of other teachings that I</text>
  <text start="438.21" dur="3.99">have I could be wrong about that I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="440.07" dur="4.2">saying that that&amp;#39;s but on some future</text>
  <text start="442.2" dur="7.19">year this is what the resurrection</text>
  <text start="444.27" dur="8.37">happens now why is 10-10-10 highlighted</text>
  <text start="449.39" dur="5.38">remember when yah first gave the Torah</text>
  <text start="452.64" dur="3.9">he started off with the ten commandments</text>
  <text start="454.77" dur="3.899">that he gave to Moses and then the</text>
  <text start="456.54" dur="4.89">people of Israel said oh we can&amp;#39;t bear</text>
  <text start="458.669" dur="4.56">to hear anymore give the rest to Moses</text>
  <text start="461.43" dur="4.35">and so then yah began to give the rest</text>
  <text start="463.229" dur="5.281">of the Torah to Moses that he faithfully</text>
  <text start="465.78" dur="4.67">wrote down and we have those</text>
  <text start="468.51" dur="5.63">Commandments if you go to Revelation</text>

  <text start="510.54" dur="4.179">President Trump wants to build a wall</text>
  <text start="512.2" dur="4.889">the New Jerusalem will have walls there</text>
  <text start="514.719" dur="6.391">very clearly stipulated in Revelation 21</text>
  <text start="517.089" dur="6.241">22 the walls are good but those who who</text>
  <text start="521.11" dur="6.32">keep the commandments will have right to</text>

  <text start="613.42" dur="7.169">called must reconciling Torah Messiah</text>
  <text start="617.02" dur="5.4">and Paul and it shows exactly what Paul</text>
  <text start="620.589" dur="2.521">said Paul always encouraged people to</text>
  <text start="622.42" dur="1.72">keep Torah</text>
  <text start="623.11" dur="3.46">always</text>
  <text start="624.14" dur="5.58">there is no there is no separation</text>
  <text start="626.57" dur="4.92">between Jew and Gentile we are all one</text>
  <text start="629.72" dur="3.21">in Messiah we&amp;#39;ve been grafted-in by his</text>
  <text start="631.49" dur="3.029">blood through Israel and so now all</text>
  <text start="632.93" dur="3.54">those instructions given to Israel are</text>
  <text start="634.519" dur="3.481">given to us so these commandments are</text>
  <text start="636.47" dur="3.63">beautiful and they&amp;#39;re given to us and</text>
  <text start="638" dur="3.69">they bring us closer to Christ it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="640.1" dur="5.16">like oh I have to do this that&amp;#39;s all I</text>
  <text start="641.69" dur="6.63">get to do this I get to do Sabbath I get</text>
  <text start="645.26" dur="4.769">to I get to take the first fruits of my</text>
  <text start="648.32" dur="4.709">income and give them to the poor the</text>
  <text start="650.029" dur="4.711">widows and the orphans I get to keep the</text>
  <text start="653.029" dur="3.391">Hebrew feast days it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an honor</text>
  <text start="654.74" dur="4.969">it&amp;#39;s a privilege to be grafted into</text>
  <text start="656.42" dur="7.32">Israel by the blood of Messiah Yahshua</text>
  <text start="659.709" dur="6.161">so I just wanted to highlight this now</text>
  <text start="663.74" dur="3.839">one thing is interesting about trumpets</text>
  <text start="665.87" dur="4.649">of course it&amp;#39;s the one feast day that</text>
  <text start="667.579" dur="4.591">happens on the new moon a new moon you</text>
  <text start="670.519" dur="3.271">go again into numbers the new moon</text>
  <text start="672.17" dur="2.97">always begins a new month a new Hebrew</text>
  <text start="673.79" dur="3.539">month for those of you who asked for the</text>
  <text start="675.14" dur="4.8">Hebrew calendar you&amp;#39;ll see the new moons</text>
  <text start="677.329" dur="4.111">highlighted on their calendar as the</text>
  <text start="679.94" dur="3.57">people of assisi well Daniel I&amp;#39;m looking</text>
  <text start="681.44" dur="4.41">at your calendar and on the calendar it</text>
  <text start="683.51" dur="3.9">shows the picture of the the new moon</text>
  <text start="685.85" dur="3.51">the Black Moon but then sometimes your</text>
  <text start="687.41" dur="3.48">new moon is a day or two later well</text>
  <text start="689.36" dur="2.94">there&amp;#39;s a reason for that if you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="690.89" dur="2.49">flat earth you&amp;#39;re probably going to want</text>
  <text start="692.3" dur="5.07">to stop because your heads going to</text>
  <text start="693.38" dur="8.91">explode when I go into this but so</text>
  <text start="697.37" dur="10.409">basically every single month every</text>
  <text start="702.29" dur="9.6">single month the the earth the moon and</text>
  <text start="707.779" dur="5.281">the Sun there&amp;#39;s a moment in time every</text>
  <text start="711.89" dur="3.18">month where they&amp;#39;re all in perfect</text>
  <text start="713.06" dur="3.42">planetary alignment that&amp;#39;s what the new</text>
  <text start="715.07" dur="3.69">moon is that&amp;#39;s what causes the moon to</text>
  <text start="716.48" dur="6.09">become black it happens at one moment in</text>
  <text start="718.76" dur="9.36">time every month whatever time that this</text>
  <text start="722.57" dur="7.68">occurs in Jerusalem in Israel that</text>
  <text start="728.12" dur="3.42">following sunset begins the day of the</text>
  <text start="730.25" dur="3.029">new moon so you can see there can be a</text>
  <text start="731.54" dur="4.53">day or two after when the actual new</text>
  <text start="733.279" dur="4.92">moon occurs because a day a Hebrew day</text>
  <text start="736.07" dur="3.84">always begins when the Sun sets that</text>
  <text start="738.199" dur="3.031">evening you can&amp;#39;t begin a day in the</text>
  <text start="739.91" dur="3.95">middle of the night or whatever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="741.23" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s darkness to light this is Genesis 1</text>
  <text start="743.86" dur="3.669">also there&amp;#39;s a second witness in</text>
  <text start="745.82" dur="3.99">Leviticus 23 when it talks about Yom</text>
  <text start="747.529" dur="3.601">Kippur begins on the ninth day of even -</text>
  <text start="749.81" dur="2.98">the tenth day vmon always means the</text>
  <text start="751.13" dur="6.6">evening so let me give you some example</text>
  <text start="752.79" dur="9.26">so let&amp;#39;s say that on September 17th the</text>
  <text start="757.73" dur="7.99">actual new moon occurs at 3:47 am</text>
  <text start="762.05" dur="6.49">jerusalem local time right well the new</text>
  <text start="765.72" dur="3.78">moon actually occurs then but but but</text>
  <text start="768.54" dur="3.57">you have to wait till the following</text>
  <text start="769.5" dur="6.69">sunset so you wouldn&amp;#39;t start the day the</text>
  <text start="772.11" dur="6.66">new moon until September 17th as at</text>
  <text start="776.19" dur="6.03">sunset in Israel that&amp;#39;s when the day of</text>
  <text start="778.77" dur="6.63">the new moon begins so as the Sun sets</text>
  <text start="782.22" dur="5.91">in Israel it begins in cascading fashion</text>
  <text start="785.4" dur="4.38">to set all across the earth and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="788.13" dur="4.08">when the day of the new moon begins so</text>
  <text start="789.78" dur="4.35">this is why the first day of the month</text>
  <text start="792.21" dur="3.51">the day of the new moon which always</text>
  <text start="794.13" dur="3.84">begins in the evening that&amp;#39;s when a day</text>
  <text start="795.72" dur="4.74">begins can be a day or two after that</text>
  <text start="797.97" dur="4.05">actual new moon now there are people</text>
  <text start="800.46" dur="2.94">that will say you got to site the new</text>
  <text start="802.02" dur="3.93">moon the first Crescent that&amp;#39;s a bunch</text>
  <text start="803.4" dur="4.59">of Talmudic nonsense and hogwash it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="805.95" dur="4.83">wicked and it&amp;#39;s not in Scripture you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="807.99" dur="4.35">never find anyone going outside and</text>
  <text start="810.78" dur="3.45">looking for the crescent of the moon</text>
  <text start="812.34" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s nowhere in scripture it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="814.23" dur="5.19">found in that child sex talmud in fact</text>
  <text start="817.65" dur="4.02">the Crescent is actually the symbol of</text>
  <text start="819.42" dur="4.41">Islam the child sex pedophilia of</text>
  <text start="821.67" dur="3.99">religion so going out and sighting a new</text>
  <text start="823.83" dur="5.1">moon and having witnesses see it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="825.66" dur="5.64">total nonsense the new moon is always</text>
  <text start="828.93" dur="4.29">when it&amp;#39;s completely black anyone can</text>
  <text start="831.3" dur="3.3">figure it out even a child you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="833.22" dur="3.39">even need NASA to figure this out</text>
  <text start="834.6" dur="4.41">because according to ancient writings</text>
  <text start="836.61" dur="4.2">even Babylon Egypt a lot of ancient</text>
  <text start="839.01" dur="5.24">civilizations including Israel they knew</text>
  <text start="840.81" dur="5.73">exactly when the new moons would occur</text>
  <text start="844.25" dur="4.42">the ancients were a lot smarter than we</text>
  <text start="846.54" dur="3.81">give them credit for evolutionists try</text>
  <text start="848.67" dur="3.39">to make us think that people have been</text>
  <text start="850.35" dur="3.78">evolving and getting better actually</text>
  <text start="852.06" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;ve been de-evolving it&amp;#39;s the second</text>
  <text start="854.13" dur="3.54">law of thermodynamics things go from a</text>
  <text start="855.81" dur="3.21">state of order to disorder things have</text>
  <text start="857.67" dur="2.52">been getting worse because when sin</text>
  <text start="859.02" dur="3.57">entered the world things started</text>
  <text start="860.19" dur="4.35">breaking down so things won&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="862.59" dur="4.2">go in reverse and start spiraling upward</text>
  <text start="864.54" dur="4.38">until the Messiah returns and puts a</text>
  <text start="866.79" dur="4.35">stop to all this nonsense but but in any</text>
  <text start="868.92" dur="6.26">case that I hope that confused that</text>
  <text start="871.14" dur="14.21">clears up the confusion of that calendar</text>
  <text start="875.18" dur="13.959">so again it&amp;#39;s important to understand</text>
  <text start="885.35" dur="6.76">that the gospel the Messiah the true</text>
  <text start="889.139" dur="3.481">gospel is you fall so in love with the</text>
  <text start="892.11" dur="2.039">Messiah</text>
  <text start="892.62" dur="3.329">you&amp;#39;re covered in his blood which wipes</text>
  <text start="894.149" dur="3.901">away your past transgressions of Torah</text>
  <text start="895.949" dur="4.26">and you&amp;#39;re filled with his spirit which</text>
  <text start="898.05" dur="4.05">gives you an inward desire to seek out</text>
  <text start="900.209" dur="4.171">and to try struck to a bait or it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="902.1" dur="3.87">process sanctification is always a</text>
  <text start="904.38" dur="4.11">process but that we have a heart where</text>
  <text start="905.97" dur="4.289">we&amp;#39;re saying oh oh here&amp;#39;s a commandment</text>
  <text start="908.49" dur="3.12">let me put this into my life oh look how</text>
  <text start="910.259" dur="3.091">much it&amp;#39;s blessing look how much it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="911.61" dur="4.38">bringing me closer Messiah and yeah</text>
  <text start="913.35" dur="4.469">persecutions come friends and family</text>
  <text start="915.99" dur="3.39">turn on you things like that but Messiah</text>
  <text start="917.819" dur="2.161">promised that in Matthew 10 he said that</text>
  <text start="919.38" dur="3.66">that would happen</text>
  <text start="919.98" dur="5.099">Paul never said that the the walk of</text>
  <text start="923.04" dur="3.57">following the Messiah was gonna be rosy</text>
  <text start="925.079" dur="3.781">in fact he said look I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="926.61" dur="4.62">shipwrecked three times I&amp;#39;ve been stoned</text>
  <text start="928.86" dur="4.02">with stones I&amp;#39;ve been beaten with a rod</text>
  <text start="931.23" dur="4.26">I&amp;#39;ve been you know I mean the guy was</text>
  <text start="932.88" dur="4.079">half drugged dead through town a lot of</text>
  <text start="935.49" dur="4.17">times because when he would preach</text>
  <text start="936.959" dur="4.5">people got so upset so the road of</text>
  <text start="939.66" dur="4.979">walking with the Messiah was never</text>
  <text start="941.459" dur="7.921">promised to be rosy it was promised to</text>
  <text start="944.639" dur="8.301">be right to be good it I mean the peace</text>
  <text start="949.38" dur="5.91">that you&amp;#39;re given within is priceless</text>
  <text start="952.94" dur="3.67">even if you&amp;#39;re under the Lions Den no</text>
