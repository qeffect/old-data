  <text start="29.07" dur="6.989">had a number of things that I wanted to</text>
  <text start="32.93" dur="6.91">cover today but I&amp;#39;m kind of gonna be</text>
  <text start="36.059" dur="6.711">putting most of this aside I make it to</text>
  <text start="39.84" dur="7.289">some of this later in the show but um</text>
  <text start="42.77" dur="7.84">there&amp;#39;s a pretty horrific news story</text>
  <text start="47.129" dur="4.95">that has just emerged and I have a</text>
  <text start="50.61" dur="4.8">feeling it&amp;#39;s going to dominate the show</text>
  <text start="52.079" dur="6.48">I&amp;#39;m literally just down the street from</text>
  <text start="55.41" dur="6.44">where I live today this morning late</text>
  <text start="58.559" dur="6">this morning there was a shooting</text>
  <text start="61.85" dur="4.24">details are still pretty sketchy on on</text>
  <text start="64.559" dur="4.85">exactly what happened but evidently a</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="8.819">man who was estranged from his wife</text>
  <text start="69.409" dur="8.231">armed stormed into the legacy drug</text>
  <text start="74.909" dur="6.091">center drug testing center facility</text>

  <text start="81" dur="8.04">springs which is right here in tualatin</text>
  <text start="84.56" dur="8.019">literally maybe in a minute minutes</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="7.649">drive from where I live if that and he</text>
  <text start="92.579" dur="7.771">shot and killed his wife shot another</text>
  <text start="96.689" dur="6.11">man has not been identified in his 60s</text>
  <text start="100.35" dur="5.309">and he would start flighted to ohsu</text>
  <text start="102.799" dur="6.07">injured another woman who evidently fled</text>
  <text start="105.659" dur="6.091">from the scene and went right across the</text>
  <text start="108.869" dur="5.521">street to the local subway to get help</text>
  <text start="111.75" dur="5.79">and then the man evidently killed</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="6.81">himself and police were on the scene</text>
  <text start="117.54" dur="6.119">within a few minutes I happen to be at a</text>
  <text start="121.2" dur="4.919">friend&amp;#39;s house that was in the</text>
  <text start="123.659" dur="5.611">neighborhood and I I remember that</text>
  <text start="126.119" dur="5.34">morning and sort of early afternoon and</text>
  <text start="129.27" dur="3.93">by the way this all happened around 11 I</text>
  <text start="131.459" dur="4.441">think it was 1148 when it was report</text>
  <text start="133.2" dur="4.77">it the shootings occurred just but just</text>
  <text start="135.9" dur="3.69">prior to that i had heard a bunch of</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="2.94">sirens you know things going on but I</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="2.49">just I didn&amp;#39;t think of anything I just</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="4.579">thought maybe there&amp;#39;s a fire or</text>
  <text start="142.08" dur="6.689">something going on um and then about</text>
  <text start="145.489" dur="6.821">130-145 in the afternoon I left my</text>
  <text start="148.769" dur="6.421">friends house and I was cutting across</text>

  <text start="160.98" dur="4.53">get on to martin aussie for more Springs</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="4.349">because everything had been cordon off</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="5.4">as I got toward the end of warm springs</text>
  <text start="168.569" dur="4.711">or rather where warm springs intersects</text>
  <text start="170.91" dur="5.07">Martin Ozzie and Martin Ozzy is a</text>
  <text start="173.28" dur="6.989">primary vein the north-south vein that</text>
  <text start="175.98" dur="7.25">goes into tualatin it was all cordon off</text>
  <text start="180.269" dur="5.911">by just I mean there were tons of police</text>
  <text start="183.23" dur="5.64">media was everywhere there was a</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="5.6">helicopter hovering in the air</text>
  <text start="188.87" dur="6.04">everything had been just completely</text>
  <text start="191.78" dur="5.23">blocked off and I couldn&amp;#39;t tell what had</text>
  <text start="194.91" dur="4.35">happened so I i went to the fred meyer</text>
  <text start="197.01" dur="6">went to the bank and I&amp;#39;m talking to the</text>
  <text start="199.26" dur="5.97">bank manager and he tells me that you</text>
  <text start="203.01" dur="5.099">know yeah but don&amp;#39;t Lea there was a</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="7.08">shooting and the man shot someone at the</text>
  <text start="208.109" dur="7.621">the drug testing center it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="6.06">horrific because um tualatin where I</text>
  <text start="215.73" dur="6.39">where I live it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a very quiet town</text>
  <text start="218.37" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s not known for crime in fact really</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="7.589">nothing like this on this magnitude</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="7.35">occurs not even close you know a you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="229.709" dur="3.75">be hard-pressed to be to be mugged or</text>
  <text start="231.6" dur="4.229">two to have a shoplifting incident</text>
  <text start="233.459" dur="3.87">happened to you in tualatin because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.829" dur="5.341">just that type of neighborhoods middle</text>
  <text start="237.329" dur="5.28">class it&amp;#39;s about 26,000 people south</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="3.179">west of portland it&amp;#39;s a very nice</text>
  <text start="242.609" dur="4.35">neighborhood a very nice area if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="244.349" dur="4.11">driven in the tualatin area you know</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="4.051">what i&amp;#39;m talking about it&amp;#39;s a very nice</text>
  <text start="248.459" dur="7.081">classy area and these things just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="251.01" dur="8.759">happen so the fact that this this this</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="11.73">did happen is just absolutely absolutely</text>
  <text start="259.769" dur="10.501">horrific it&amp;#39;s just unbelievable um sorry</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="6.51">about that sound there right my phone</text>
  <text start="270.27" dur="7.399">just went off um what I want to discuss</text>
  <text start="273.78" dur="7.139">is why did this happen now that this</text>
  <text start="277.669" dur="5.531">hits close to home literally as well as</text>
  <text start="280.919" dur="4.171">figuratively why did this happen I mean</text>
  <text start="283.2" dur="3.48">of course all the prognostic caters will</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="3.78">talk about the domestic violence issue</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="3.239">and you know the husband being a</text>
  <text start="288.87" dur="4.62">straight from the wife evidently the</text>
  <text start="289.919" dur="5.25">wife had just divorced her husband on I</text>
  <text start="293.49" dur="3.419">think was October the 30th he was served</text>
  <text start="295.169" dur="3.541">with the divorce papers on November the</text>
  <text start="296.909" dur="5.851">fourth he was upset about the divorce</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="6.54">but i think if we want to go to the</text>
  <text start="302.76" dur="6.99">deeper root and and how it would relate</text>
  <text start="305.25" dur="8.55">to this show obviously there was a lack</text>
  <text start="309.75" dur="9.24">of torah in this marriage between these</text>
  <text start="313.8" dur="13.049">two individuals but I I want to go a bit</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="11.07">further than that because I want to you</text>
  <text start="326.849" dur="6.661">see I think a lot of problems that we</text>
  <text start="330.06" dur="5.82">are dealing with today is directly</text>
  <text start="333.51" dur="3.779">because of the church refusing to uphold</text>
  <text start="335.88" dur="7.349">the standards of righteousness and of</text>
  <text start="337.289" dur="8.841">Torah and what I mean by that is that we</text>
  <text start="343.229" dur="6.06">have a limp-wristed sloppy agape</text>
  <text start="346.13" dur="5.86">anything goes type of gospel now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="349.289" dur="4.831">know who these two individuals are but I</text>
  <text start="351.99" dur="5.46">would be willing to bet that they have</text>
  <text start="354.12" dur="7.02">had some contact in some way shape or</text>
  <text start="357.45" dur="5.91">form with a church and I&amp;#39;m willing to</text>
  <text start="361.14" dur="3.93">almost assure you that this church did</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="5.58">not uphold the righteous standards of</text>
  <text start="365.07" dur="5.61">Torah and had they done so had the</text>
  <text start="368.94" dur="3.69">church that they had been exposed to as</text>
  <text start="370.68" dur="4.83">children or young adults or even</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="5.25">currently in their lives have that</text>
  <text start="375.51" dur="5.219">church upheld the righteous standards of</text>
  <text start="377.88" dur="6.089">Torah the shooting probably would not</text>
  <text start="380.729" dur="8.06">have happened now the that&amp;#39;s assuming</text>
  <text start="383.969" dur="8.041">that they had church a church background</text>
  <text start="388.789" dur="6.37">but chances are they probably had most</text>
  <text start="392.01" dur="5.1">Americans have and I tell you on the day</text>
  <text start="395.159" dur="3.181">of judgment the church is going to have</text>
  <text start="397.11" dur="4.71">a lot of blood on her hand</text>
  <text start="398.34" dur="5.79">because of her refusal to uphold the</text>
  <text start="401.82" dur="4.08">righteous standards of Torah and and</text>
  <text start="404.13" dur="4.319">that&amp;#39;s how I think that an instant like</text>
  <text start="405.9" dur="7.29">this and the massacre that occurred at</text>
  <text start="408.449" dur="7.381">at Fort Hood last week how that impacts</text>
  <text start="413.19" dur="5.49">us that we as believers need to be</text>
  <text start="415.83" dur="5.04">upholding the standards of Torah because</text>
  <text start="418.68" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;re going to be the blame for the evil</text>
  <text start="420.87" dur="5.299">that is rising among us if we don&amp;#39;t if</text>
  <text start="424.5" dur="5.49">we refuse because a limp-wristed slap</text>
  <text start="426.169" dur="6.191">agape anything-goes gospel encourages</text>
  <text start="429.99" dur="4.53">evil and encourages things like this and</text>
  <text start="432.36" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s why we have shootings at fort</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="6.09">hood and and shootings domestic violence</text>
  <text start="437.52" dur="5.88">shootings here in a quiet town known as</text>
  <text start="440.61" dur="4.529">tualatin where nothing like this ever</text>
  <text start="443.4" dur="5.4">happens it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a horrific day an</text>
  <text start="445.139" dur="5.941">horrific incident evidently this couple</text>
  <text start="448.8" dur="5.45">had children whose lives will be forever</text>
  <text start="451.08" dur="5.79">altered it&amp;#39;s very very horrific and</text>
  <text start="454.25" dur="5.919">whatever the intentions of this husband</text>
  <text start="456.87" dur="4.799">was and I&amp;#39;m count I&amp;#39;m not blaming all</text>
  <text start="460.169" dur="4.111">the blame on the husband even though he</text>
  <text start="461.669" dur="4.741">of it obviously was the killer typically</text>
  <text start="464.28" dur="3.75">in you know incidents like this what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466.41" dur="4.02">evolving a husband and wife there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.03" dur="5.699">blame on both sides that&amp;#39;s typically how</text>
  <text start="470.43" dur="7.29">it goes but the husband obviously was</text>
  <text start="473.729" dur="6.601">motivated purely by selfishness had no</text>
  <text start="477.72" dur="4.319">thought for his children or for his</text>
  <text start="480.33" dur="6.059">family or anyone around him certainly</text>
  <text start="482.039" dur="7.44">not his wife and so we&amp;#39;re left with two</text>
  <text start="486.389" dur="4.881">lives that are gone and children that</text>
  <text start="489.479" dur="6.231">are orphaned and it&amp;#39;s a horrific</text>
  <text start="491.27" dur="4.44">horrific situation</text>
