  <text start="0.77" dur="6.609">shabbat shalom this is Daniel John Lee</text>
  <text start="4.02" dur="7.44">with Torah restoration ministries it is</text>
  <text start="7.379" dur="8.161">June the 17th 2017 it is the Shabbat and</text>
  <text start="11.46" dur="6.6">as this is the 7/7 part of my 17 part</text>
  <text start="15.54" dur="6.53">series reconciling the teachings of</text>
  <text start="18.06" dur="7.26">Messiah with Apostle Paul this is part 7</text>
  <text start="22.07" dur="6.4">on the book of Galatians against the</text>
  <text start="25.32" dur="4.68">Torah and of course it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="28.47" dur="3.51">appropriate I have actually James block</text>
  <text start="30" dur="4.8">is playing live from Israel right now</text>
  <text start="31.98" dur="5.4">and he just he just spoke out about how</text>
  <text start="34.8" dur="4.829">the false shepherds over centuries have</text>
  <text start="37.38" dur="5.76">confused us with the traditions of men</text>
  <text start="39.629" dur="5.691">and my ears perked up when he said that</text>
  <text start="43.14" dur="5.96">because that is what Galatians is about</text>
  <text start="45.32" dur="6.219">Galatians is about the traditions of men</text>
  <text start="49.1" dur="4.18">so many Christians have tried to use</text>
  <text start="51.539" dur="3.991">this book to say we don&amp;#39;t need to keep</text>
  <text start="53.28" dur="4.799">Torah we don&amp;#39;t need to obey the Torah</text>
  <text start="55.53" dur="5.52">but that is not what Galatians is about</text>
  <text start="58.079" dur="4.651">it is about the traditions of men and</text>
  <text start="61.05" dur="3.81">before we get into galatians i just want</text>
  <text start="62.73" dur="4.05">to remind everyone of one of the three</text>
  <text start="64.86" dur="4.86">main principles that was covered in part</text>
  <text start="66.78" dur="4.32">1 of this series and one of those three</text>
  <text start="69.72" dur="3.63">main principles in fact I think it was</text>
  <text start="71.1" dur="6.559">the first one that I put up there is</text>
  <text start="73.35" dur="7.23">from Matthew 5 starting in verse 17</text>
  <text start="77.659" dur="5.801">think not this is Yahshua the Messiah</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="6.359">talking think not that I am come to</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="6.81">destroy the Torah or the prophets I come</text>
  <text start="86.939" dur="6.39">not to destroy but to fulfill phillup to</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="6.209">revive for real a saying to you until</text>
  <text start="93.329" dur="5.101">the heavens inter-pass not one jot or</text>
  <text start="96.479" dur="4.791">one tittle shall in no wise pass from</text>
  <text start="98.43" dur="5.07">the Torah so everything is accomplished</text>
  <text start="101.27" dur="4.029">whosoever therefore shall break one of</text>
  <text start="103.5" dur="4.95">these least Commandments and shall teach</text>
  <text start="105.299" dur="5.341">men so he shall be called the least in</text>
  <text start="108.45" dur="4.23">the kingdom of heaven but whosoever</text>
  <text start="110.64" dur="4.53">shall do and teach them the same shall</text>
  <text start="112.68" dur="5.039">be called great in the kingdom of heaven</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="6.299">so Yahshua very clearly says right here</text>
  <text start="117.719" dur="6">if you are telling people to not obey</text>
  <text start="121.469" dur="4.321">even the smallest jot or tittle of Torah</text>
  <text start="123.719" dur="2.58">you&amp;#39;re going to be looked at as least in</text>
  <text start="125.79" dur="3.359">his kingdom</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="4.02">so Galatians has have been used as they</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="2.741">look we don&amp;#39;t have to keep all these</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="3.731">jots and tittles of Torah</text>
  <text start="131.89" dur="3.42">allow that obviously if that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="134.05" dur="3.36">what Paul was saying it would come</text>
  <text start="135.31" dur="4.02">completely against what Messiah taught</text>
  <text start="137.41" dur="3.24">in Matthew five and of course we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="139.33" dur="3.69">going to show that that&amp;#39;s not what Paul</text>
  <text start="140.65" dur="4.35">was saying at all he is teaching number</text>
  <text start="143.02" dur="3.45">one primarily against the traditions of</text>
  <text start="145" dur="4.38">men and then the other issue he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="146.47" dur="5.61">dealing with is that the Torah obedience</text>
  <text start="149.38" dur="4.77">to the actual Torah never justifies you</text>
  <text start="152.08" dur="5.49">and that&amp;#39;s true it never it was never</text>
  <text start="154.15" dur="6.72">designed to justify anyone it was always</text>
  <text start="157.57" dur="5.19">an act of obedience after you fall in</text>
  <text start="160.87" dur="5.46">love with yah after you fall in love</text>
  <text start="162.76" dur="6.03">with the Messiah remember Abraham he</text>
  <text start="166.33" dur="4.26">believed Anyang that was accounted to</text>
  <text start="168.79" dur="3.449">him righteousness right</text>
  <text start="170.59" dur="5.25">he believed on yond before he was ever</text>
  <text start="172.239" dur="6.871">circumsized but when yah then commanded</text>
  <text start="175.84" dur="5.6">him to get circumcised he did so right</text>
  <text start="179.11" dur="5.52">so it didn&amp;#39;t justify him it was a</text>
  <text start="181.44" dur="5.08">structure to be done after one has been</text>
  <text start="184.63" dur="4.02">washed in the blood filled with the</text>
  <text start="186.52" dur="3.93">spirit and loves yah with all the heart</text>
  <text start="188.65" dur="3.12">soul mind and strength so those are the</text>
  <text start="190.45" dur="3.27">two issues were going to talk about and</text>
  <text start="191.77" dur="4.999">that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s what Galatians is all</text>
  <text start="193.72" dur="6.09">about so starting in Galatians chapter 1</text>
  <text start="196.769" dur="4.75">Paul is making this introduction in the</text>
  <text start="199.81" dur="4.77">first few verses talking about this very</text>
  <text start="201.519" dur="4.801">accursed gospel and he even says anyone</text>
  <text start="204.58" dur="3.629">who teaches this gospel let him be</text>
  <text start="206.32" dur="4.44">accursed it&amp;#39;s a perversion of the true</text>
  <text start="208.209" dur="5.84">gospel and what is this perversion if we</text>
  <text start="210.76" dur="7.44">find it highlighted first in verse 14</text>
  <text start="214.049" dur="5.921">relations 1:14 because Paul is talking</text>
  <text start="218.2" dur="5.67">about before he was converted and he</text>
  <text start="219.97" dur="5.82">says as he was persecuting the</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="3.99">Assemblies of yah he said and he</text>
  <text start="225.79" dur="4.65">profited in the Jews religion above many</text>
  <text start="227.86" dur="4.65">of my equals in mine own nation being</text>
  <text start="230.44" dur="5.519">more exceedingly zealous of the</text>
  <text start="232.51" dur="4.77">traditions of my father&amp;#39;s the traditions</text>
  <text start="235.959" dur="3.09">of my father&amp;#39;s that is the thesis</text>
  <text start="237.28" dur="4.29">statement for all of Galatians the</text>
  <text start="239.049" dur="4.621">traditions of my father&amp;#39;s so what are</text>
  <text start="241.57" dur="3.63">these traditions well if you go to the</text>
  <text start="243.67" dur="3.48">Gospels you&amp;#39;ll find a lot of these</text>
  <text start="245.2" dur="4.59">traditions that Yahshua rails against</text>
  <text start="247.15" dur="6.33">these traditions that you can&amp;#39;t carry a</text>
  <text start="249.79" dur="6">mat on the Sabbath that you can pay a</text>
  <text start="253.48" dur="4.379">piece of money at the temple called</text>
  <text start="255.79" dur="3.72">Corbin and you can then not have to</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="3.661">honor your father and mother these</text>
  <text start="259.51" dur="4.55">traditions of the fathers that literally</text>
  <text start="261.52" dur="5.72">opposed the very written Torah</text>
  <text start="264.06" dur="4.86">of Moshe now traditions in and of</text>
  <text start="267.24" dur="3.84">themselves are not wrong but when</text>
  <text start="268.92" dur="4.68">traditions oppose the word of yah</text>
  <text start="271.08" dur="4.5">whether they be traditions in first</text>
  <text start="273.6" dur="4.77">century Judaism or whether they be</text>
  <text start="275.58" dur="5.25">traditions in 21st century Christianity</text>
  <text start="278.37" dur="4.44">when they oppose the word of yah those</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="4.29">traditions are evil it&amp;#39;s a perversion of</text>
  <text start="282.81" dur="5.49">the gospel and that&amp;#39;s what Paul that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.12" dur="5.01">what many of the Pharisees and Sadducees</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="4.56">were following not the actual written</text>
  <text start="290.13" dur="6.3">Torah but they were actually following</text>
  <text start="292.86" dur="5.4">the traditions of men this is why Paul</text>
  <text start="296.43" dur="3.87">although he thought he was zealous for</text>
  <text start="298.26" dur="4.53">the Torah was committing murder with</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="5.01">sanctioning murder okay</text>
  <text start="302.79" dur="3.96">he was sanctioning murder of people who</text>
  <text start="305.31" dur="3.33">are following in the way this was before</text>
  <text start="306.75" dur="3.45">he&amp;#39;s converted because he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="308.64" dur="2.37">understand the very heart of Torah which</text>
  <text start="310.2" dur="2.7">is what is it</text>
  <text start="311.01" dur="4.53">love your neighbor love your neighbor</text>
  <text start="312.9" dur="4.89">and love yot so whenever you get lost in</text>
  <text start="315.54" dur="4.82">the traditions of men as they pose the</text>
  <text start="317.79" dur="5.49">written word of yah it will completely</text>
  <text start="320.36" dur="6.01">get your entire focus off where it needs</text>
  <text start="323.28" dur="6.389">to be so as their traditions of men that</text>
  <text start="326.37" dur="5.58">he&amp;#39;s dealing with now how do we know</text>
  <text start="329.669" dur="5.641">that we&amp;#39;re talking about the traditions</text>
  <text start="331.95" dur="8.36">of men so if we go into Galatians</text>
  <text start="335.31" dur="8.1">chapter 2 was a start in verse verse 1</text>
  <text start="340.31" dur="4.9">then 14 years after I went up again to</text>
  <text start="343.41" dur="2.52">Jerusalem with Barnabas and took Titus</text>
  <text start="345.21" dur="2.459">with me also</text>
  <text start="345.93" dur="4.32">and I went up by revelation and</text>
  <text start="347.669" dur="4.381">communicated unto them that gospel which</text>
  <text start="350.25" dur="3.45">I preached among the Gentiles but</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="3.869">privately to them which were of</text>
  <text start="353.7" dur="5.219">reputation lest by any means I should</text>
  <text start="355.919" dur="5.461">run or had run in vain but neither Titus</text>
  <text start="358.919" dur="5.461">who was with me being a greek was</text>
  <text start="361.38" dur="4.289">compelled to be circumcised and that</text>
  <text start="364.38" dur="3.99">because of false brethren unawares</text>
  <text start="365.669" dur="4.591">brought in who came in privily to spy</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="4.41">out liberty which we have in Messiah</text>
  <text start="370.26" dur="6.75">Yahshua that they might bring us into</text>
  <text start="372.78" dur="6.27">bondage okay so that word compelled if</text>
  <text start="377.01" dur="6.6">you look up that word in in the Greek it</text>
  <text start="379.05" dur="7.05">literally means to threaten by force now</text>
  <text start="383.61" dur="4.29">nowhere in the Torah are you to be</text>
  <text start="386.1" dur="3.459">threatened by force to get circumcised</text>
  <text start="387.9" dur="4.089">nowhere</text>
  <text start="389.559" dur="4.35">so we&amp;#39;re not actually talking about the</text>
  <text start="391.989" dur="3.6">circumcision that was given to Abraham</text>
  <text start="393.909" dur="5.1">that you&amp;#39;re supposed to do to your male</text>
  <text start="395.589" dur="5.04">son on the eighth day of his life we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.009" dur="3.54">not talking about the circumcision that</text>
  <text start="400.629" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s supposed to be done in order for</text>
  <text start="402.549" dur="5.52">you to partake a Passover in fact you</text>
  <text start="406.329" dur="4.32">could just replace circumcision with</text>
  <text start="408.069" dur="3.9">water baptism are you ever supposed to</text>
  <text start="410.649" dur="3.69">force them to thread anyone to be</text>
  <text start="411.969" dur="3.57">baptized by water of course not</text>
  <text start="414.339" dur="4.2">no that&amp;#39;s something that you</text>
  <text start="415.539" dur="5.04">automatically want to do because you</text>
  <text start="418.539" dur="4.35">have been converted you&amp;#39;ve been washed</text>
  <text start="420.579" dur="4.26">clean of your sins so you want to get</text>
  <text start="422.889" dur="3.6">baptized in water in the same way you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="424.839" dur="4.41">have an inward desire to want to be</text>
  <text start="426.489" dur="4.32">circumcised the circumcision of Abraham</text>
  <text start="429.249" dur="4.41">because these are commandments that you</text>
  <text start="430.809" dur="5.07">have given us to do so Paul is again</text>
  <text start="433.659" dur="5.34">referring to this circumcision of Moses</text>
  <text start="435.879" dur="5.64">which we talked about earlier in part</text>
  <text start="438.999" dur="5.7">two that&amp;#39;s covered in acts 15 which is</text>
  <text start="441.519" dur="4.71">basically this whole all these it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="444.699" dur="3">traditions of the father&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.229" dur="3.12">talking about in verse 14 the</text>
  <text start="447.699" dur="3.42">circumcision that is talked about here</text>
  <text start="449.349" dur="4.261">is the traditions of the father&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.119" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s this complex ritual that you have</text>
  <text start="453.61" dur="4.619">to enter into to follow all these vain</text>
  <text start="456.309" dur="3.21">traditions that oppose the Torah that is</text>
  <text start="458.229" dur="2.79">what&amp;#39;s being discussed here we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="459.519" dur="3.48">actually talking about the removal</text>
  <text start="461.019" dur="4.02">before skin and that&amp;#39;s very easily</text>
  <text start="462.999" dur="5.37">provable because if you go to Acts</text>
  <text start="465.039" dur="7.77">chapter 16 you&amp;#39;ll find what Paul did to</text>
  <text start="468.369" dur="6.72">Timothy in verse 3 it says Timothy would</text>
  <text start="472.809" dur="4.23">Paul have to go forth with him and so</text>
  <text start="475.089" dur="3.72">Paul took and circumcised Timothy</text>
  <text start="477.039" dur="4.08">because the Jews which were in those</text>
  <text start="478.809" dur="3.24">quarters for they knew all that his</text>
  <text start="481.119" dur="3.81">father was a Greek</text>
  <text start="482.049" dur="4.86">so Timothy was a half Gentile here and</text>
  <text start="484.929" dur="3.3">Paul had him circumcised but wait a</text>
  <text start="486.909" dur="2.49">minute but you said Paul said that you</text>
  <text start="488.229" dur="2.21">don&amp;#39;t have to be circumcised we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="489.399" dur="3.3">talking about two different issues here</text>
  <text start="490.439" dur="3.82">one we&amp;#39;re talking about the actual</text>
  <text start="492.699" dur="2.67">circumcision that you&amp;#39;re supposed to do</text>
  <text start="494.259" dur="2.91">and that&amp;#39;s why Paul had Timothy</text>
  <text start="495.369" dur="4.23">circumcise this one that we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="497.169" dur="5.01">about with Titus is this acts 15</text>
  <text start="499.599" dur="4.89">traditions of the father&amp;#39;s so everything</text>
  <text start="502.179" dur="5.66">can be understood by the context by the</text>
  <text start="504.489" dur="6.24">context of how it&amp;#39;s being talked about</text>
  <text start="507.839" dur="5.021">the actual circumcision given to Abraham</text>
  <text start="510.729" dur="4.95">which is again just an outward sign of</text>
  <text start="512.86" dur="5.13">what has in word change just like water</text>
  <text start="515.679" dur="5.1">baptism is an outward sign of an inward</text>
  <text start="517.99" dur="3.29">change okay these things don&amp;#39;t bring you</text>
  <text start="520.779" dur="3.14">into bond</text>
  <text start="521.28" dur="5.7">don&amp;#39;t bring you into bondage but trying</text>
  <text start="523.919" dur="4.801">to follow traditions of men that opposed</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="6.47">the Torah oh yeah that absolutely brings</text>
  <text start="528.72" dur="7.14">you into bondage and that&amp;#39;s why these</text>
  <text start="533.45" dur="4.63">these Pharisees were trying to bring</text>
  <text start="535.86" dur="4.89">these believing these new believers in</text>
  <text start="538.08" dur="5.04">Galatia into this to further own glory</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="5.34">for their own glory follow those these</text>
  <text start="543.12" dur="4.38">own man-made traditions and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="546.09" dur="4.05">Palka needs to talk about throughout</text>
  <text start="547.5" dur="4.41">chapter two now when we get to verse 11</text>
  <text start="550.14" dur="3.87">of chapter 2 we&amp;#39;re going to talk about</text>
  <text start="551.91" dur="4.86">an actual tradition of a father that</text>
  <text start="554.01" dur="5.66">Peter started flipping into and Paul had</text>
  <text start="556.77" dur="5.52">to rebuke him so starting in verse 11</text>
  <text start="559.67" dur="4.54">but when Peter was come to Antioch I</text>
  <text start="562.29" dur="4.68">withstood him to the face because he was</text>
  <text start="564.21" dur="5.37">to be blamed for before that certain</text>
  <text start="566.97" dur="4.38">came from James he did eat with the</text>
  <text start="569.58" dur="4.11">Gentiles but when they were come he</text>
  <text start="571.35" dur="5.28">would drew and separated himself fearing</text>
  <text start="573.69" dur="4.74">them which were of the circumcision but</text>
  <text start="576.63" dur="3.63">the other Jews dissembled likewise with</text>
  <text start="578.43" dur="3.95">him and so much that Barnabas also was</text>
  <text start="580.26" dur="4.62">carried away with their dissimulation</text>
  <text start="582.38" dur="4.51">but when I saw that they walked not</text>
  <text start="584.88" dur="4.29">uprightly according to the truth of the</text>
  <text start="586.89" dur="5.67">gospel I said unto Peter before them all</text>
  <text start="589.17" dur="5.01">if thou being a jew liveth after the</text>
  <text start="592.56" dur="4.29">manner of gentiles and nodded to the</text>
  <text start="594.18" dur="6.9">jews why compel of style the gentiles to</text>
  <text start="596.85" dur="5.73">live as do the jews you see there is</text>
  <text start="601.08" dur="3.72">nothing in Torah that says we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="602.58" dur="4.17">allowed to eat with the Gentiles in fact</text>
  <text start="604.8" dur="3.69">these are Gentile blazes or new</text>
  <text start="606.75" dur="5.37">believers who are being grafted in the</text>
  <text start="608.49" dur="5.79">Commonwealth of Israel who wants to walk</text>
  <text start="612.12" dur="4.2">in covenant with yah if anything we need</text>
  <text start="614.28" dur="3.6">to eat with these people we need to</text>
  <text start="616.32" dur="3.78">fellowship with these people to teach</text>
  <text start="617.88" dur="4.98">them the actual written Torah that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="620.1" dur="4.739">whole point but there was a tradition of</text>
  <text start="622.86" dur="4.59">men that was embedded in first century</text>
  <text start="624.839" dur="5.041">Judaism where it told us never to eat</text>
  <text start="627.45" dur="4.32">with Gentiles well that is just not in</text>
  <text start="629.88" dur="3.63">Torah anywhere so this is a tradition of</text>
  <text start="631.77" dur="2.85">the father that Peter was starting to</text>
  <text start="633.51" dur="3.24">fall into because he was getting</text>
  <text start="634.62" dur="3.719">pressured by these other Pharisees that</text>
  <text start="636.75" dur="3.93">were coming to pray on the Galatian</text>
  <text start="638.339" dur="4.621">believers and Paul rebuked them for it</text>
  <text start="640.68" dur="4.77">our boots are for you so why are you</text>
  <text start="642.96" dur="5.43">trying to get these Gentiles to now live</text>
  <text start="645.45" dur="4.139">under these traditions of men like these</text>
  <text start="648.39" dur="2.09">Jews are doing when you&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="649.589" dur="2.811">doing that</text>
  <text start="650.48" dur="4.5">because Peter had cast off those</text>
  <text start="652.4" dur="4.23">traditions of men and returned to the</text>
  <text start="654.98" dur="3">pure Torah out of a love from aside</text>
  <text start="656.63" dur="5.22">because that&amp;#39;s what Yahshua taught him</text>
  <text start="657.98" dur="6.03">and continued emphasize like in acts 10</text>
  <text start="661.85" dur="3.57">when he gave him that dream be sure that</text>
  <text start="664.01" dur="5.67">Gentiles could be filled with the spirit</text>
  <text start="665.42" dur="6.51">which is exactly what Torah teaches so</text>
  <text start="669.68" dur="4.97">again this is an example very clearly</text>
  <text start="671.93" dur="7.29">here that Paul is coming against the</text>
  <text start="674.65" dur="8.26">traditions of men so skipping ahead to</text>
  <text start="679.22" dur="6.09">Galatians three o foolish Galatians who</text>
  <text start="682.91" dur="5.46">is bewitched you that you should not</text>
  <text start="685.31" dur="4.98">obey the truth before whose eyes Yahshua</text>
  <text start="688.37" dur="4.35">the Messiah has evidently been set forth</text>
  <text start="690.29" dur="4.47">crucified among you it&amp;#39;s only what I</text>
  <text start="692.72" dur="4.23">learn of you received you the spirit by</text>
  <text start="694.76" dur="7.29">the works of the law or by the hearing</text>
  <text start="696.95" dur="8.16">of faith by the works of the law or the</text>
  <text start="702.05" dur="4.68">curing of faith now again there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="705.11" dur="4.7">things that have to be considered when</text>
  <text start="706.73" dur="6.48">Paul&amp;#39;s asking this question first of all</text>
  <text start="709.81" dur="6.16">you are converted by the hearing of</text>
  <text start="713.21" dur="6.39">faith by faith by placing your trust in</text>
  <text start="715.97" dur="5.43">Yahshua the Messiah and then because</text>
  <text start="719.6" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;ve put your trust in him now you</text>
  <text start="721.4" dur="4.49">want to do the works of the Torah the</text>
  <text start="724.13" dur="4.35">work the commandments that are given you</text>
  <text start="725.89" dur="5.92">so that&amp;#39;s how you that&amp;#39;s how it should</text>
  <text start="728.48" dur="5.76">operate these Pharisees are trying to to</text>
  <text start="731.81" dur="4.32">put the cart before the horse and say no</text>
  <text start="734.24" dur="3.93">no the works of the law come first but</text>
  <text start="736.13" dur="4.44">then the other thing that we have to pay</text>
  <text start="738.17" dur="4.59">attention to is that word law it all it</text>
  <text start="740.57" dur="4.59">means in the Greek is know most and that</text>
  <text start="742.76" dur="6.48">word normos can refer to any system or</text>
  <text start="745.16" dur="5.88">body of regulations or rules so it could</text>
  <text start="749.24" dur="5.19">be referring to the Torah or it could be</text>
  <text start="751.04" dur="4.83">referring to what the Jews had an idea</text>
  <text start="754.43" dur="3.36">of the tour of in the first century was</text>
  <text start="755.87" dur="3.69">with a mixture of the actual</text>
  <text start="757.79" dur="4.26">Commandments along with these traditions</text>
  <text start="759.56" dur="4.68">of the fathers that violated the Torah</text>
  <text start="762.05" dur="3.33">okay so these are the two things you</text>
  <text start="764.24" dur="5.85">have to keep in mind as you&amp;#39;re reading</text>
  <text start="765.38" dur="6.69">this scripture are you so foolish having</text>
  <text start="770.09" dur="4.5">begun in the spirit are you now made</text>
  <text start="772.07" dur="4.23">perfect by the flesh so when you try to</text>
  <text start="774.59" dur="4.23">follow these traditions of the fathers</text>
  <text start="776.3" dur="4.5">that violate the Torah you&amp;#39;re walking in</text>
  <text start="778.82" dur="3.72">the flesh you&amp;#39;re doing this to puff</text>
  <text start="780.8" dur="4.49">yourself up that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="782.54" dur="5.16">to pump yourself up</text>
  <text start="785.29" dur="5.44">have you suffered so many things in vain</text>
  <text start="787.7" dur="5.25">if it be yet in vain he therefore that</text>
  <text start="790.73" dur="4.44">ministers to you the spirit and works</text>
  <text start="792.95" dur="4.14">miracles among you does he do it by the</text>
  <text start="795.17" dur="4.47">rooks the law or by the hearing of faith</text>
  <text start="797.09" dur="4.44">and then here he goes into Abraham even</text>
  <text start="799.64" dur="4.37">as abraham believed God and it was</text>
  <text start="801.53" dur="5.13">accounted to him for righteousness</text>
  <text start="804.01" dur="4.42">know ye therefore that they which are of</text>
  <text start="806.66" dur="2.43">faith the same are the children of</text>
  <text start="808.43" dur="3.21">Abraham</text>
  <text start="809.09" dur="3.3">so did Abraham threw away the Torah no</text>
  <text start="811.64" dur="3.09">of course not</text>
  <text start="812.39" dur="7.29">Abraham circumcised himself when he was</text>
  <text start="814.73" dur="8.79">99 years of age but he wasn&amp;#39;t justified</text>
  <text start="819.68" dur="5.52">by that he was justified by faith and</text>
  <text start="823.52" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s the point that Paul was trying to</text>
  <text start="825.2" dur="6.33">make here in fact he even says it very</text>
  <text start="828.65" dur="4.98">clearly in verse 11 when it says but</text>
  <text start="831.53" dur="4.2">that no man is justified by the law on</text>
  <text start="833.63" dur="3.26">the side of yad is evident for the just</text>
  <text start="835.73" dur="3.93">shall live by faith</text>
  <text start="836.89" dur="5.08">it is trusting in him and is living in</text>
  <text start="839.66" dur="4.23">accordance with his precepts it is fully</text>
  <text start="841.97" dur="4.29">surrendering to him that&amp;#39;s how you live</text>
  <text start="843.89" dur="4.35">and by doing so then you start obeying</text>
  <text start="846.26" dur="4.28">the Commandments in the Torah that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="848.24" dur="2.3">it works</text>
  <text start="850.66" dur="6.31">but again first century Jews Judaism</text>
  <text start="853.339" dur="5.491">tries to reverse the process tried to</text>
  <text start="856.97" dur="4.619">say no no you got to go through these</text>
  <text start="858.83" dur="4.92">man-made tradition complex rituals and</text>
  <text start="861.589" dur="4.741">that&amp;#39;s what actually saves you and it</text>
  <text start="863.75" dur="4.83">doesn&amp;#39;t it would be like if a modern</text>
  <text start="866.33" dur="5.759">Christian said if you get dunked in h2o</text>
  <text start="868.58" dur="5.46">that will save you if you go to church</text>
  <text start="872.089" dur="3.601">on Sunday that work that will save you</text>
  <text start="874.04" dur="4.41">well that&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="875.69" dur="5.07">those things don&amp;#39;t save you it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="878.45" dur="3.78">Yahshua seated on the heart of the the</text>
  <text start="880.76" dur="8.329">heart of your the throne of your heart</text>
  <text start="882.23" dur="11.39">that saves you so Paul makes that that</text>
  <text start="889.089" dur="6.821">point over and over and over again</text>
  <text start="893.62" dur="5.38">skipping further down in Galatians 3</text>
  <text start="895.91" dur="4.86">wherefore then serves the law now here</text>
  <text start="899" dur="3.87">he is he seyde my Torah here it was</text>
  <text start="900.77" dur="3.9">added because of transgressions till the</text>

  <text start="920.73" dur="4.109">righteousness should have been by the</text>

  <text start="936.449" dur="4.05">revealed wherefore the law was our</text>
  <text start="938.79" dur="4.349">schoolmaster to bring us unto messiah</text>
  <text start="940.499" dur="4.05">that we might be justified by faith now</text>
  <text start="943.139" dur="3.75">is Paul saying that once we come to</text>
  <text start="944.549" dur="3.69">Messiah we throw away the law no he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="946.889" dur="3.69">not saying that that would be ridiculous</text>
  <text start="948.239" dur="6.12">because parts of the law are do not</text>
  <text start="950.579" dur="5.461">commit adultery do not cheat do not bear</text>
  <text start="954.359" dur="5.31">false witness we obviously know we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="956.04" dur="6.239">throw away those things but before we</text>
  <text start="959.669" dur="4.561">come to Messiah that very law does not</text>
  <text start="962.279" dur="3.71">bring us life all it does is condemn us</text>
  <text start="964.23" dur="4.289">it just shows us what we&amp;#39;ve done wrong</text>
  <text start="965.989" dur="4.63">after we come to the Messiah after we</text>
  <text start="968.519" dur="4.951">fall in love with him those very same</text>
  <text start="970.619" dur="5.34">laws that once condemned us and and and</text>
  <text start="973.47" dur="5.399">get used us now they bring us life</text>
  <text start="975.959" dur="5.22">because now we love him so we joyfully</text>
  <text start="978.869" dur="4.47">want to obey these things we want to a</text>
  <text start="981.179" dur="7.2">baby&amp;#39;s Commandments that&amp;#39;s the essence</text>
  <text start="983.339" dur="9.391">of the gospel all right going into</text>
  <text start="988.379" dur="6.18">Galatians 4 now I say that the air as</text>

  <text start="1279.75" dur="3.81">should suffer persecution for the cross</text>
  <text start="1281.34" dur="5.28">of Messiah again we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="1283.56" dur="5.37">that acts 15 circumcision the</text>
  <text start="1286.62" dur="4.92">circumcision of Moses which is again</text>
  <text start="1288.93" dur="5.1">this induction into all these rules and</text>
  <text start="1291.54" dur="6.21">regulations invented by men a yoke of</text>
  <text start="1294.03" dur="5.73">bondage that no man can bear and the</text>
  <text start="1297.75" dur="3.51">motivation was also that they could say</text>
  <text start="1299.76" dur="3.69">hey look these people are followers of</text>
  <text start="1301.26" dur="4.5">us we&amp;#39;ve imposed the system of</text>
  <text start="1303.45" dur="2.94">regulations on them well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1305.76" dur="2.59">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1306.39" dur="3.789">that&amp;#39;s utterly ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1308.35" dur="3">and Paul could have easily started</text>
  <text start="1310.179" dur="2.791">teaching that and then he wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1311.35" dur="3.48">had any persecution from the Jews but he</text>
  <text start="1312.97" dur="3.959">wasn&amp;#39;t teaching that he was teaching</text>
  <text start="1314.83" dur="5.01">that you are justified by the spirit of</text>
  <text start="1316.929" dur="4.891">yot by his son by his blood and then you</text>
  <text start="1319.84" dur="5.669">go into the commandments into the Torah</text>
  <text start="1321.82" dur="5.52">and then he gets what then yo receives</text>
  <text start="1325.509" dur="3.54">all the glory because the only way that</text>
  <text start="1327.34" dur="3.75">you can do all these other things in</text>
  <text start="1329.049" dur="8.071">Torah is because he&amp;#39;s living within you</text>
  <text start="1331.09" dur="9.39">so he gets the glory not men now verse</text>
  <text start="1337.12" dur="6.12">13 is very very very revealing for it</text>
  <text start="1340.48" dur="5.909">says for neither they themselves who are</text>
  <text start="1343.24" dur="4.95">circumcised keep the law but desire to</text>
  <text start="1346.389" dur="4.53">have you circumcised that they may glory</text>
  <text start="1348.19" dur="5.219">in your flesh so these guys who were</text>
  <text start="1350.919" dur="3.99">quote-unquote circumcised they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1353.409" dur="4.86">even keeping the very tour that they</text>
  <text start="1354.909" dur="6.27">were telling others to keep they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1358.269" dur="6.36">and this is that statement is repeated</text>
  <text start="1361.179" dur="4.59">by messiah in matthew 23:23</text>
  <text start="1364.629" dur="3.961">which is also one of the three</text>
  <text start="1365.769" dur="5.221">principles that I went over in in part</text>
  <text start="1368.59" dur="4.319">one where Yahshua rebukes the ferry</text>
  <text start="1370.99" dur="3.99">season says woe unto you scribes and</text>
  <text start="1372.909" dur="4.65">Pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithes</text>
  <text start="1374.98" dur="4.169">of mint and anis and cumin and you have</text>
  <text start="1377.559" dur="5.07">omitted the weightier matters of the</text>
  <text start="1379.149" dur="5.581">Torah judgment mercy and faith these</text>
  <text start="1382.629" dur="4.92">ought you to have done and not to leave</text>
  <text start="1384.73" dur="4.829">the other undone so as I is not saying</text>
  <text start="1387.549" dur="4.321">stop keeping these small jobs and civil</text>
  <text start="1389.559" dur="5.941">authorities saying do all the Torah do</text>
  <text start="1391.87" dur="6.419">it all but you see they hit a mini mitad</text>
  <text start="1395.5" dur="4.889">judgment mercy and faith and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1398.289" dur="3.84">these Pharisees trying to beguile these</text>
  <text start="1400.389" dur="3.211">new Galatian believers were also trying</text>
  <text start="1402.129" dur="5.13">to do they were trying to present a</text>
  <text start="1403.6" dur="7.74">Torah that did not have mercy judgment</text>
  <text start="1407.259" dur="5.91">or faith which is really no tour at all</text>
  <text start="1411.34" dur="3.51">and so that&amp;#39;s why paul says they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1413.169" dur="3.48">circumcised but they don&amp;#39;t even keep the</text>
  <text start="1414.85" dur="5.279">very law but they&amp;#39;re trying to impose</text>
  <text start="1416.649" dur="5.64">upon you but yah forbid that i should</text>
  <text start="1420.129" dur="4.321">glory starts opinion with verse 14 of</text>
  <text start="1422.289" dur="5.37">Galatians 6 yah forbid that I should</text>
  <text start="1424.45" dur="4.829">glory save in the cross of our Yahshua</text>

  <text start="1429.279" dur="4.23">crucified unto me and I end of the world</text>
  <text start="1431.259" dur="4.17">for in Messiah Yahshua neither</text>

  <text start="1451.549" dur="4.771">you obey them or not it means nothing</text>
  <text start="1453.89" dur="4.38">what does matter is being a new creation</text>
  <text start="1456.32" dur="4.29">in Messiah allowing the son of man to</text>
  <text start="1458.27" dur="6.029">form in you so that you can then walk in</text>

  <text start="1487.25" dur="6.24">is exposes what the false gospel is but</text>
  <text start="1490.789" dur="6.181">in no way does he tell people not to</text>
  <text start="1493.49" dur="5.039">obey the Torah in fact if anything he</text>
  <text start="1496.97" dur="4.8">says keep away from the traditions of</text>
