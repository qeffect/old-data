  <text start="5.58" dur="5.67">the Sabbath the seventh day of the week</text>
  <text start="7.319" dur="5.251">the Shabbat made the six 2017 can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="11.25" dur="4.349">believe it&amp;#39;s already over twenty one</text>
  <text start="12.57" dur="5.43">three weeks now into the countdown to</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="4.02">chef any cost from the Sabbath and</text>
  <text start="18" dur="5.369">Passover week the day after Sabbath and</text>
  <text start="19.619" dur="7.311">Passover week amazing so this is part 4</text>
  <text start="23.369" dur="5.851">of 17 of my teaching series on</text>
  <text start="26.93" dur="5.62">reconciling the teachings of Messiah</text>
  <text start="29.22" dur="8.1">Yahshua and Apostle Paul part forces</text>
  <text start="32.55" dur="6.54">Romans 10 equals Deuteronomy 30 so this</text>
  <text start="37.32" dur="5.1">is a really amazing chapter that Paul</text>
  <text start="39.09" dur="6.3">writes in Romans chapter 10 listen to</text>
  <text start="42.42" dur="4.86">what he says he says starting at the</text>
  <text start="45.39" dur="3.689">very beginning you know he expresses his</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="4.619">heart&amp;#39;s desire that that all Israel</text>
  <text start="49.079" dur="4.89">should be saved and he knowledge is that</text>
  <text start="51.899" dur="4.32">that many of these Israelites have a</text>
  <text start="53.969" dur="3.721">zeal but not according to knowledge that</text>
  <text start="56.219" dur="3.601">they&amp;#39;re going about establishing their</text>
  <text start="57.69" dur="5.16">own righteousness and why because what</text>
  <text start="59.82" dur="5.339">we saw in parts two and three is that</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="3.809">the leadership met most of the</text>
  <text start="65.159" dur="3.511">leadership of the first century Jewish</text>
  <text start="66.659" dur="3.811">nation what were they doing they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="4.14">following the written Torah out of a</text>
  <text start="70.47" dur="4.079">heart of the love they were creating</text>
  <text start="72.81" dur="4.26">their own man-made traditions and</text>
  <text start="74.549" dur="4.291">commandments and laws their own what</text>
  <text start="77.07" dur="4.11">they would call taka note their own</text>
  <text start="78.84" dur="4.139">man-made instructions many of which</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="3.119">violated the Torah and so they were</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="3.541">establishing their own righteousness</text>
  <text start="84.299" dur="6.601">rather than following yaws righteousness</text>
  <text start="86.52" dur="6.33">and so Paul says but Messiah he is the</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="3.66">end of the tour of her isida store</text>
  <text start="92.85" dur="3.839">everyone that believes he&amp;#39;s the goal</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="3.629">actually that word Telos goal he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="96.689" dur="5.101">goal masai is the goal that the Torah</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="5.281">points toward for Moses describes the</text>
  <text start="101.79" dur="3.57">righteousness which is of the Torah but</text>
  <text start="103.47" dur="4.5">the man which do with those things shall</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="5.009">live by them in verse 6 that should be</text>
  <text start="107.97" dur="4.469">an not but Paul&amp;#39;s not contrasting and</text>
  <text start="110.369" dur="4.351">I&amp;#39;m going to prove this through what he</text>
  <text start="112.439" dur="4.171">writes later in this chapter and the</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="4.77">righteousness which is of faith speaks</text>
  <text start="116.61" dur="4.439">on this wise say not in your heart who</text>
  <text start="119.49" dur="3.93">shall ascend into heaven that is to</text>
  <text start="121.049" dur="3.991">bring Messiah down from above or who</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="3.42">shall descend into the deep that is to</text>
  <text start="125.04" dur="4.26">bring out Messiah again from the dead</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="4.289">but what says it the word is nigh thee</text>
  <text start="129.3" dur="4.05">even in your mouth and in your heart</text>
  <text start="131.129" dur="4.831">that is the Word of Faith which</text>
  <text start="133.35" dur="5.25">preach that if you will confess with</text>
  <text start="135.96" dur="5.64">your mouth that the Messiah Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="138.6" dur="4.95">shall believe in your heart that yah had</text>
  <text start="141.6" dur="4.53">raised not from the dead you shall be</text>
  <text start="143.55" dur="4.23">saved for with the heart man believes</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="6.3">unto righteousness and with the mouth</text>
  <text start="147.78" dur="6.84">confession is made unto salvation Paul</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="5.22">right there he is quoting directly from</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="6.12">Deuteronomy chapter 30 Deuteronomy</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="5.67">chapter 30 this is the chapter where</text>
  <text start="160.74" dur="5.34">Moshe has given the Torah once again</text>
  <text start="163.32" dur="4.8">that gu tirana me is all a book about</text>
  <text start="166.08" dur="5.34">recounting the entire Torah of Mosher</text>
  <text start="168.12" dur="6.03">and at the very end of giving all the</text>
  <text start="171.42" dur="4.5">Torah once again he says in Deuteronomy</text>
  <text start="174.15" dur="4.44">30 right toward into the book starting</text>
  <text start="175.92" dur="4.29">in verse 11 he says for this commandment</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="4.47">or this Torah which I command you this</text>
  <text start="180.21" dur="5.7">day it is not hidden from me from thee</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="4.47">neither is it far off it is not in</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="3.6">heaven that you should say who shall go</text>
  <text start="187.53" dur="3.48">up to up for us to heaven and bring it</text>
  <text start="189.51" dur="4.17">unto us that we may hear it and do it</text>
  <text start="191.01" dur="4.53">neither is it beyond the sea that you</text>
  <text start="193.68" dur="3.39">should say who shall go over the sea for</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="4.2">us and bring it unto us that we may hear</text>
  <text start="197.07" dur="4.41">it and do it but the word is very nyam</text>
  <text start="199.74" dur="5.52">to you in your mouth and in your heart</text>
  <text start="201.48" dur="5.91">that you may do it so what is the</text>
  <text start="205.26" dur="5.01">possible very deliberately doing in</text>
  <text start="207.39" dur="6.84">Romans 10 he is directly quoting</text>
  <text start="210.27" dur="6.81">Deuteronomy 30 verses 11 through 14 and</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="6.51">he&amp;#39;s simply replacing commandment or</text>
  <text start="217.08" dur="6.03">Torah with Christ or Messiah why did he</text>
  <text start="220.74" dur="5.25">do this because the Messiah Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="223.11" dur="4.83">the Torah clothes and flesh they are one</text>
  <text start="225.99" dur="3.18">of the same they&amp;#39;re inseparable he is</text>
  <text start="227.94" dur="4.35">showing that there&amp;#39;s no difference</text>
  <text start="229.17" dur="4.56">just as yah told the Israelites hey</text>
  <text start="232.29" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t think that you can&amp;#39;t do these</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="3.69">Commandments this is not way over the</text>
  <text start="236.04" dur="3.3">sea that you have to sail who&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s not way up at all who&amp;#39;s going to go</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="4.14">you saying you can do this this word is</text>
  <text start="241.89" dur="3.72">in your heart in your mat you can obey</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="3.57">this Torah and in the same way Paul</text>
  <text start="245.61" dur="4.32">saying Messiah</text>
  <text start="247.05" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t say Messiah is way descendent of</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="4.41">the deep who&amp;#39;s gonna or he&amp;#39;s way up in</text>
  <text start="251.91" dur="4.829">heaven but this word is near you you can</text>
  <text start="254.34" dur="4.769">believe in him which means to obey Him</text>
  <text start="256.739" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s one in the same keeping matura</text>
  <text start="259.109" dur="3.331">and obeying Messiah are one of the same</text>
  <text start="260.609" dur="3.041">and Paul&amp;#39;s making this very clear by</text>
  <text start="262.44" dur="3.039">quoting directly for</text>
  <text start="263.65" dur="4.799">Deuteronomy 30 and simply replacing the</text>
  <text start="265.479" dur="7.201">word Torah or commandment with the word</text>
  <text start="268.449" dur="6">Messiah now I said earlier I was going</text>
  <text start="272.68" dur="4.65">to prove that he&amp;#39;s not contrasting</text>
  <text start="274.449" dur="4.771">believing in faith and obeying Tory&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.33" dur="4.11">not contrasting that at all and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.22" dur="4.97">where I&amp;#39;m going to prove that if you go</text>
  <text start="281.44" dur="6.93">a little farther than Romans 10 it says</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="6.4">in starting in verse 15 it says how</text>
  <text start="288.37" dur="4.14">shall they preach except they be sent as</text>
  <text start="290.59" dur="4.109">it is written how beautiful are the feet</text>
  <text start="292.51" dur="4.32">of them that preach the gospel of Shalom</text>
  <text start="294.699" dur="4.711">with peace and bring glad tidings of</text>
  <text start="296.83" dur="6.66">good things but they have not all obeyed</text>
  <text start="299.41" dur="9.59">the gospel for Isaiah says Lord who</text>
  <text start="303.49" dur="9.51">believed our report so you catch that</text>
  <text start="309" dur="7.419">Isiah way back in the times of Torah was</text>
  <text start="313" dur="5.43">preaching the same gospel that Paul is</text>
  <text start="316.419" dur="4.261">preaching here in the first century it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.43" dur="4.08">the same everlasting gospel it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="320.68" dur="5.25">been the same gospel since the beginning</text>
  <text start="322.51" dur="5.58">of time until now 2017 and that gospel</text>
  <text start="325.93" dur="4.26">is simply this you hearken to his voice</text>
  <text start="328.09" dur="3.72">and keep his Commandments you hearken to</text>
  <text start="330.19" dur="4.229">his voice and keep his Commandments it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.81" dur="3.9">never changed the only had changed and</text>
  <text start="334.419" dur="3.151">we&amp;#39;ll go over this when we get into the</text>
  <text start="335.71" dur="4.11">parts later when we go through the book</text>
  <text start="337.57" dur="5.01">of Hebrews loin has changed and now</text>
  <text start="339.82" dur="5.46">Yahshua has shed his blood he stamped</text>
  <text start="342.58" dur="6.48">the Torah in his blood he&amp;#39;s provided a</text>
  <text start="345.28" dur="5.91">huge moral inward incentive by our</text>
  <text start="349.06" dur="4.919">hearts being broken by what he did for</text>
  <text start="351.19" dur="4.74">us to now obey His commandments so that</text>
  <text start="353.979" dur="4.201">these aren&amp;#39;t just written on tablets of</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="4.08">stone but they&amp;#39;re now in our hearts but</text>
  <text start="358.18" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re in our tablets of flesh he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.01" dur="3.719">giving us a heart of flesh rather than a</text>
  <text start="361.87" dur="3.99">heart of stone and by the way there were</text>
  <text start="363.729" dur="5.011">still people with hearts of flesh in the</text>
  <text start="365.86" dur="4.559">Torah times I mean we see that we see</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="3.209">Moshe was filled with the spirit of yot</text>
  <text start="370.419" dur="3.451">we see other examples of that throughout</text>
  <text start="371.949" dur="4.741">the Scriptures but now it&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="373.87" dur="6.81">and masse it&amp;#39;s happening with with the</text>
  <text start="376.69" dur="6.15">multitudes and multitudes because back</text>
  <text start="380.68" dur="3.6">then their revelation was very limited I</text>
  <text start="382.84" dur="3.48">mean they were only looking very much</text>
  <text start="384.28" dur="6.18">into the distant future when one day</text>
  <text start="386.32" dur="5.7">Messiah would come but here and now and</text>
  <text start="390.46" dur="3.63">back in the first century they had seen</text>
  <text start="392.02" dur="3.13">the fullness of yah manifest himself</text>
  <text start="394.09" dur="3.28">from the flesh</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="7.5">through the image of himself Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="397.37" dur="7.95">now now it was happening much much</text>
  <text start="402.65" dur="4.799">greater proportions because the Astra</text>
  <text start="405.32" dur="4.14">has now shed his blood he has manifested</text>
  <text start="407.449" dur="5.311">himself to the world you know people say</text>
  <text start="409.46" dur="6.87">come when Yahshua says to his disciples</text>
  <text start="412.76" dur="5.28">you know a new thing I tell you love</text>
  <text start="416.33" dur="4.02">each other as I have loved you what was</text>
  <text start="418.04" dur="4.29">the new thing because the commandment to</text>
  <text start="420.35" dur="4.02">love is not new that&amp;#39;s in the Torah</text>
  <text start="422.33" dur="4.29">it didn&amp;#39;t deuteronomy where it says hear</text>
  <text start="424.37" dur="3.63">o israel love the Lord your God with all</text>
  <text start="426.62" dur="3.03">your heart soul mind and strength and</text>
  <text start="428" dur="3.51">love your neighbor as yourself that was</text>
  <text start="429.65" dur="6.269">in the torch that wasn&amp;#39;t new what was</text>
  <text start="431.51" dur="6.84">new what was new was that yah at long</text>
  <text start="435.919" dur="4.651">last had manifested himself in the flesh</text>
  <text start="438.35" dur="5.16">and shown how to walk out the Torah</text>
  <text start="440.57" dur="5.069">through love on this earth that was what</text>
  <text start="443.51" dur="5.46">was new and so that was what was a</text>
  <text start="445.639" dur="6.511">change but this gospel was the same this</text>
  <text start="448.97" dur="5.31">gospel was the same so Paul again he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="452.15" dur="3.54">saying man these Jewish leaders they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="454.28" dur="3.21">trying to go about establishing their</text>
  <text start="455.69" dur="3.69">own righteousness they&amp;#39;re doing their</text>
  <text start="457.49" dur="4.23">own man-made commandments all these</text>
  <text start="459.38" dur="4.23">things that are against the Torah just</text>
  <text start="461.72" dur="3.87">like many Christians do today in the</text>
  <text start="463.61" dur="4.08">21st century where they&amp;#39;re going about</text>
  <text start="465.59" dur="4.259">establishing their own righteousness by</text>
  <text start="467.69" dur="3.75">changing the sabbath the sunday by</text>
  <text start="469.849" dur="3">eating pork and shellfish by keeping</text>
  <text start="471.44" dur="2.67">these pagan holidays like eastern</text>
  <text start="472.849" dur="3.061">Christmas that&amp;#39;s their own righteousness</text>
  <text start="474.11" dur="3.84">just like the Jews are creating their</text>
  <text start="475.91" dur="3.39">own righteousness but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="477.95" dur="3.42">following the righteousness of yeah</text>
  <text start="479.3" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s submitting to his righteousness</text>
  <text start="481.37" dur="4.95">and Paul says so what is that and they</text>
  <text start="483.68" dur="4.23">says Christ Messiah obeying him</text>
  <text start="486.32" dur="3.18">believing in him and by the way</text>
  <text start="487.91" dur="4.11">believing in him believing in the heart</text>
  <text start="489.5" dur="3.75">is not just you don&amp;#39;t mental assent or a</text>
  <text start="492.02" dur="2.73">confession believing in your heart mean</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="3.71">you&amp;#39;re obeying Messiah</text>
  <text start="494.75" dur="5.099">you&amp;#39;ve totally surrendered to him and</text>
  <text start="496.96" dur="5.17">then he says this righteousness of faith</text>
  <text start="499.849" dur="5.13">is don&amp;#39;t say that&amp;#39;s way up in heaven</text>
  <text start="502.13" dur="4.469">just like Moses says and this command</text>
  <text start="504.979" dur="4.62">which I can aid it&amp;#39;s not hidden from me</text>
  <text start="506.599" dur="4.891">don&amp;#39;t say it&amp;#39;s way up in heaven Paul</text>

  <text start="517.909" dur="4.461">obeying this commandment obeying the</text>
  <text start="519.77" dur="5.189">torah is the same as obeying messiah and</text>
