  <text start="3.929" dur="8.13">is the friday night june the 17th 2016</text>
  <text start="9" dur="5.61">it is almost now the 13th day of the</text>
  <text start="12.059" dur="6.631">third hebrew month we are now almost a</text>
  <text start="14.61" dur="6.509">week away we passed rather shallotte but</text>
  <text start="18.69" dur="4.53">on this Sabbath day weekly shabbat that</text>
  <text start="21.119" dur="5.67">happens every week from Friday night to</text>
  <text start="23.22" dur="7.94">Saturday night I wanted to do a teaching</text>
  <text start="26.789" dur="6.511">on a prophetic timeline of events as</text>
  <text start="31.16" dur="4.48">scripture maps down now this isn&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="33.3" dur="3.96">to be detailed timeline or time dates</text>
  <text start="35.64" dur="7.009">what it is is going to be an overall</text>
  <text start="37.26" dur="7.709">general picture of how events occur</text>
  <text start="42.649" dur="3.91">sequentially in the scriptures because</text>
  <text start="44.969" dur="3.57">there seems to be still a lot of</text>
  <text start="46.559" dur="3.66">confusion about that out there when the</text>
  <text start="48.539" dur="3.691">resurrections happen when these feasts</text>
  <text start="50.219" dur="3.211">irfan building and things like that this</text>
  <text start="52.23" dur="3.3">is not going to be an exhaustive</text>
  <text start="53.43" dur="4.53">teaching because literally I could spend</text>
  <text start="55.53" dur="3.65">probably all night going into scripture</text>
  <text start="57.96" dur="3.21">after scripture after scripture</text>
  <text start="59.18" dur="3.94">establishing like all these different</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="5.16">events but this is going to be more of a</text>
  <text start="63.12" dur="5.88">broad overview mainly to clarify when</text>
  <text start="66.33" dur="5.28">the resurrections occur and how they</text>
  <text start="69" dur="4.65">occur in the timeline of pathetic events</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="3.63">that are mapped out in Daniel in</text>
  <text start="73.65" dur="4.2">Revelation and a lot of the major</text>
  <text start="75.24" dur="4.65">prophets like Isaiah Jeremiah some of</text>
  <text start="77.85" dur="4.32">the minor prophets like Zachariah and</text>
  <text start="79.89" dur="8.1">things like that so without further ado</text>
  <text start="82.17" dur="7.11">shabbat shalom here we go so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="6.269">going to do is we&amp;#39;re going to start off</text>
  <text start="89.28" dur="6.75">with we&amp;#39;re going to start from the</text>
  <text start="94.259" dur="3.421">beginning of the events and then go to</text>
  <text start="96.03" dur="3.659">the end and what we&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="97.68" dur="4.02">off with is the Great Tribulation so</text>
  <text start="99.689" dur="4.89">most people know about that it&amp;#39;s a three</text>
  <text start="101.7" dur="5.37">and a half year period described in the</text>
  <text start="104.579" dur="4.43">book of Revelation it&amp;#39;s subscribed in a</text>
  <text start="107.07" dur="6.299">variety of ways three and a half years</text>
  <text start="109.009" dur="7.241">42 months 1260 days that time periods</text>
  <text start="113.369" dur="4.591">also described in the Book of Daniel so</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="6.02">we have this three-and-a-half-year Great</text>
  <text start="117.96" dur="10.51">Tribulation Period three and a half</text>
  <text start="122.27" dur="11.04">years also it&amp;#39;s known as the 42 months</text>
  <text start="128.47" dur="9.489">that the Beast reigns and it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="133.31" dur="9.36">known as the 1260 days that the two</text>
  <text start="137.959" dur="8.431">witnesses preach put two little guys two</text>
  <text start="142.67" dur="5.87">little guys here in red as the two</text>
  <text start="146.39" dur="2.15">witnesses</text>
  <text start="150.74" dur="7.55">it&amp;#39;s also known as the 1260 days in</text>
  <text start="154.58" dur="7.2">which the woman in Revelation chapter 12</text>
  <text start="158.29" dur="7.21">flees into the wilderness for a period</text>
  <text start="161.78" dur="5.73">of 1260 days so this is all the three</text>
  <text start="165.5" dur="4.86">and a half years and I have other</text>
  <text start="167.51" dur="7.2">studies about why it&amp;#39;s not a full seven</text>
  <text start="170.36" dur="7.23">years because actually the seven years</text>
  <text start="174.71" dur="7.08">that time period only occurs in the Book</text>
  <text start="177.59" dur="6.93">of Daniel and the reason why seven years</text>
  <text start="181.79" dur="4.71">never occurs in Revelation is because</text>
  <text start="184.52" dur="4.71">revelation happens after the Gospels</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="4.92">okay the book at the annual was written</text>
  <text start="189.23" dur="4.23">before the Gospels so the only</text>
  <text start="191.42" dur="3.66">difference why there&amp;#39;s seven years in</text>
  <text start="193.46" dur="3.42">Daniel and only three and a half years</text>
  <text start="195.08" dur="3.18">in Revelation is because that first two</text>
  <text start="196.88" dur="3.72">and a half years was already fulfilled</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="4.77">by Yahshua when he had his ministry</text>
  <text start="200.6" dur="4.26">2,000 years ago that&amp;#39;s a whole different</text>
  <text start="203.03" dur="3.93">subject so we have the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="204.86" dur="3.68">this three and a half year period for</text>
  <text start="206.96" dur="4.92">two month period 12 hours 60-day period</text>
  <text start="208.54" dur="5.77">now there&amp;#39;s a lot that you can go into</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="4.02">about what happens and you go to the</text>
  <text start="214.31" dur="4.47">Book of Daniel book revelation about</text>
  <text start="215.9" dur="7.67">what happens but but I want to highlight</text>
  <text start="218.78" dur="7.79">is and we&amp;#39;ll use a let&amp;#39;s use purple</text>
  <text start="223.57" dur="3">royalty</text>
  <text start="226.9" dur="5.52">right toward the end of the Great</text>
  <text start="229.09" dur="5.16">Tribulation on a some future yom teruah</text>
  <text start="232.42" dur="3.959">which is the Feast of Trumpets always</text>
  <text start="234.25" dur="4.92">occurs in the fall it&amp;#39;s always the first</text>
  <text start="236.379" dur="6.181">day of the 70 per month right toward the</text>
  <text start="239.17" dur="6.269">end that seventh trumpet blast okay so</text>
  <text start="242.56" dur="6.48">we will put it right toward the end the</text>
  <text start="245.439" dur="8.42">seventh and last trumpet blasts and this</text>
  <text start="249.04" dur="10.71">is when the first resurrection occurs</text>
  <text start="253.859" dur="7.87">first resurrection if you&amp;#39;re reading</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="4.26">revelation says blessed is he who is</text>
  <text start="261.729" dur="3.601">part of this first resurrection he will</text>
  <text start="264.01" dur="3.36">have no part in the second death</text>
  <text start="265.33" dur="4.11">everyone who participates in this first</text>
  <text start="267.37" dur="4.89">resurrection will be resurrected to</text>
  <text start="269.44" dur="6.69">everlasting life hallelujah every single</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="5.67">one so this seventh trumpet if you go to</text>
  <text start="276.13" dur="4.289">the book of Revelation you can read</text>
  <text start="277.93" dur="4.739">about seven seals you can read about</text>
  <text start="280.419" dur="3.81">seven thunders that are actually sealed</text>
  <text start="282.669" dur="3.301">up at this point you can read about</text>
  <text start="284.229" dur="4.771">seven trumpets and you can read about</text>
  <text start="285.97" dur="6">seven bolts they all occur during this</text>
  <text start="289" dur="5.61">Great Tribulation Period but the seventh</text>
  <text start="291.97" dur="5.61">trumpet happens right toward the end of</text>
  <text start="294.61" dur="8.46">the Great Tribulation this is described</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="7.38">in Revelation chapter 10 and 11 this</text>
  <text start="303.07" dur="3.71">event the seventh trumpet is when these</text>
  <text start="304.96" dur="4.11">two guys the two witnesses are</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="4.27">resurrected they&amp;#39;ve been preaching for</text>
  <text start="309.07" dur="3.96">1260 days and they&amp;#39;re lying in the</text>
  <text start="311.05" dur="3.96">streets of Jerusalem for three and a</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="3.48">half days and everyone in the world of</text>
  <text start="315.01" dur="2.61">celebrating and getting gifts to each</text>
  <text start="316.51" dur="2.76">other because they&amp;#39;re so happy they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="317.62" dur="4.74">dead and then three and a half days</text>
  <text start="319.27" dur="5.399">later they rise so they rise on this day</text>
  <text start="322.36" dur="6.83">yom teruah and remember what Apostle</text>
  <text start="324.669" dur="7.5">Paul says in 1st Thessalonians chapter 4</text>
  <text start="329.19" dur="5.38">which describes that first resurrection</text>
  <text start="332.169" dur="4.381">that the dead of Messiah rice first and</text>
  <text start="334.57" dur="3.719">then they who are alive and remain are</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="3.72">caught up with them so the dead rise</text>

  <text start="358.439" dur="3.901">twinkling of an eye and that&amp;#39;s described</text>
  <text start="359.819" dur="7.13">in 1st Thessalonians 4 it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="362.34" dur="7.43">described in 1st Corinthians chapter 15</text>
  <text start="366.949" dur="5.981">as I already said revelation 10 and 11</text>
  <text start="369.77" dur="5.29">the resurrection to everlasting life is</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="6.03">also described in revelry excuse me in</text>
  <text start="375.06" dur="6.18">Daniel chapter 12 and there&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="378.96" dur="3.9">numerous other references there are</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="3.899">throughout the songs the minor prophets</text>
  <text start="382.86" dur="4.44">to this resurrection but these are the</text>
  <text start="385.139" dur="5.43">major ones first Thessalonians 4</text>
  <text start="387.3" dur="8.31">revelation 10 11 first method 15 Daniel</text>
  <text start="390.569" dur="7.141">12 and John actually says in Revelation</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="4.529">10 that at this point in the days of the</text>
  <text start="397.71" dur="4.56">seventh trumpet when at blast the</text>
  <text start="400.139" dur="4.59">mystery of yah will be will be finished</text>
  <text start="402.27" dur="4.949">and in first Corinthians 15 Paul says</text>

  <text start="409.08" dur="3.509">twinkling of an eye as he describes that</text>
  <text start="410.819" dur="4.201">the Christians wrongly called the</text>
  <text start="412.589" dur="4.681">rapture that it&amp;#39;s not really a rapture</text>
  <text start="415.02" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s a resurrection it&amp;#39;s a resurrection</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="5.009">where the the dedham aside we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="419.61" dur="4.619">bursting from their graves it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="422.279" dur="5.461">described as a whoa in Revelation</text>
  <text start="424.229" dur="5.34">because as the dead Messire are bursting</text>
  <text start="427.74" dur="3.239">from the graves these massive</text>
  <text start="429.569" dur="4.35">earthquakes are occurring all over the</text>
  <text start="430.979" dur="4.231">world and causing a great earthquake in</text>
  <text start="433.919" dur="3.21">fact in Jerusalem where the two</text>

  <text start="437.129" dur="5.52">massive at seven thousand died in the</text>
  <text start="439.229" dur="5.791">rest periodic so this is where yom</text>

  <text start="449.43" dur="3.169">we&amp;#39;re looking forward to be fulfilled</text>
  <text start="450.479" dur="4.86">the fall feasts have been fulfilled</text>
  <text start="452.599" dur="4.54">Passover first fruits and unleavened</text>
