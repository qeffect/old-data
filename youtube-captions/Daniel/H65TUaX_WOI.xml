  <text start="114.75" dur="5.85">should impose upon other believers so</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="4.769">when you go through Romans 14 you see</text>
  <text start="120.6" dur="4.68">the phrase he that does not eat regards</text>
  <text start="123.299" dur="4.32">the day or he that eats does not regard</text>

  <text start="249.78" dur="3.299">about the observance of those days</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="4.859">because those fast days were never</text>

  <text start="364.62" dur="5.729">where is Shabbat ever mentioned in those</text>
  <text start="367.439" dur="3.991">verses the Shabbat the seventh day of</text>
  <text start="370.349" dur="3.481">the week from Friday night to Saturday</text>
  <text start="371.43" dur="4.68">night the Sabbath day is never once</text>
  <text start="373.83" dur="5.19">mentioned in those verses nor in the</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="4.89">entire book of Romans no court in the</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="3.569">land would allow verses that dumont</text>
  <text start="381" dur="3.509">mentioned the Sabbath to be used as</text>
  <text start="382.589" dur="4.621">evidence in an argument against the</text>
  <text start="384.509" dur="4.62">Sabbath so why should we and yet how</text>
  <text start="387.21" dur="4.979">many New Testament Christians try to use</text>
  <text start="389.129" dur="4.35">Romans 14 to somehow justify that they</text>
  <text start="392.189" dur="2.4">can pick any day they want is the</text>
  <text start="393.479" dur="3.541">Sabbath day and they don&amp;#39;t have to keep</text>
  <text start="394.589" dur="4.7">the seventh day shabbat this is absurd</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="5.359">because the sabbath is never one</text>
  <text start="399.289" dur="4.35">mentioned in Romans 14 you see Paul</text>
  <text start="402.379" dur="2.79">could not have been talking about</text>
  <text start="403.639" dur="5.43">keeping the Sabbath day holy because</text>
  <text start="405.169" dur="5.881">obedience to Torah is not optional it is</text>
  <text start="409.069" dur="3.87">ludicrous to suggest that any of the Ten</text>

  <text start="414.77" dur="4.44">that any of the commandments period</text>
  <text start="416.389" dur="5.221">within the entire Torah can be disobeyed</text>
  <text start="419.21" dur="5.189">unto yahweh think of the absurdity of</text>
  <text start="421.61" dur="5.279">saying he that steals to Yahweh he</text>

  <text start="426.889" dur="4.08">he stills not of course anyone who would</text>
  <text start="429.77" dur="2.729">read that sentence would think Paul</text>
  <text start="430.969" dur="3.6">would be crazy if you would say that and</text>
  <text start="432.499" dur="3.9">yet that&amp;#39;s exactly what Christians try</text>
  <text start="434.569" dur="4.62">to do when they insert the Sabbath day</text>

  <text start="818.19" dur="4.86">caught up in their Talmud that they were</text>
  <text start="820.92" dur="5.52">saying oh you cannot eat those clean</text>

  <text start="826.44" dur="3.57">whatever other clean feed you want to</text>
  <text start="827.82" dur="4.32">think of because you have not rich early</text>
  <text start="830.01" dur="3.99">put it through this Talmudic special</text>
  <text start="832.14" dur="3.84">cleansing process and therefore it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="834" dur="3.63">common and you you can&amp;#39;t eat it no</text>
  <text start="835.98" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s ridiculous that was an added</text>
  <text start="837.63" dur="4.14">thing that the rabbi&amp;#39;s had invented and</text>
  <text start="839.73" dur="5.25">this is what Paul was addressing because</text>
  <text start="841.77" dur="5.3">there was literally strife and and and</text>
  <text start="844.98" dur="4.62">and turmoil going on within the</text>

  <text start="856.71" dur="4.14">believers and it was oppressive it was</text>
  <text start="858.99" dur="3.6">it was unnecessary it was causing a</text>
  <text start="860.85" dur="4.38">stumbling block and Paul says this is</text>
  <text start="862.59" dur="4.38">ridiculous and Paul was a master of</text>
  <text start="865.23" dur="3.9">Torah he knew the tour of Moses</text>
  <text start="866.97" dur="4.68">backwards and forwards and not only that</text>
  <text start="869.13" dur="4.62">but he had repented of all that oral</text>
  <text start="871.65" dur="4.08">Talmudic Orthodox traditions he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="873.75" dur="4.29">repented of that yah had cleaned him out</text>
  <text start="875.73" dur="4.38">from all that so that he had returned to</text>
  <text start="878.04" dur="4.17">the purity of the Torah you know obeying</text>
  <text start="880.11" dur="5.61">it by the indwelling of the spirit out</text>
  <text start="882.21" dur="4.86">of a motivation to love Yahshua he truly</text>
  <text start="885.72" dur="3.24">understood how to keep the tour of the</text>
  <text start="887.07" dur="4.53">way it was originally intended to be</text>
  <text start="888.96" dur="4.86">kept when it was given to Moses and so</text>
  <text start="891.6" dur="5.7">he this is why he would write so</text>
  <text start="893.82" dur="6.87">articulately and so firmly against these</text>
  <text start="897.3" dur="5.01">Pharisees who you know bless the hearts</text>
  <text start="900.69" dur="3.51">they love Yahshua but they were still so</text>
  <text start="902.31" dur="3.42">lost in there Tom lytic Orthodox ways</text>
  <text start="904.2" dur="3.6">they were trying to impose it upon the</text>
  <text start="905.73" dur="4.41">new Gentile converts and Paul&amp;#39;s like no</text>
  <text start="907.8" dur="5.22">no no no we&amp;#39;re not going to do that so</text>
  <text start="910.14" dur="4.47">Romans 14 has nothing to do with you</text>
  <text start="913.02" dur="2.97">know being able to eat pork or shellfish</text>
  <text start="914.61" dur="3">it has nothing to do with being able to</text>
  <text start="915.99" dur="3.27">pick whatever Sabbath day you want and</text>
  <text start="917.61" dur="4.68">nothing to do with that at all it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="919.26" dur="5.94">simply dealing with the issues of people</text>
  <text start="922.29" dur="5.88">trying to impose traditions of men upon</text>
  <text start="925.2" dur="5.61">others now as I said last night there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="928.17" dur="4.02">nothing wrong with a tradition as long</text>
  <text start="930.81" dur="4.38">as it doesn&amp;#39;t oppose the</text>
  <text start="932.19" dur="4.44">the problem with the Talmud and a lot of</text>
  <text start="935.19" dur="2.88">the things the Orthodox rabbis it</text>
  <text start="936.63" dur="3.66">invented is most of their traditions</text>
  <text start="938.07" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re actually opposing the Torah that</text>
  <text start="940.29" dur="4.44">they claim to be keeping and of course</text>
  <text start="942.75" dur="3.24">Christians have the same problem because</text>
  <text start="944.73" dur="4.32">Christians have their traditions like</text>
  <text start="945.99" dur="5.46">sunday worship Easter which comes from</text>
  <text start="949.05" dur="5.55">Ishtar Christmas all the stuff that</text>
  <text start="951.45" dur="4.62">violates the scriptures so they have</text>
  <text start="954.6" dur="3.06">their traditions and they still say</text>
  <text start="956.07" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re serving Jesus just like the</text>
  <text start="957.66" dur="3.3">rabbis have their traditions and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="959.16" dur="4.17">still saying they&amp;#39;re keeping Torah and</text>
  <text start="960.96" dur="3.81">following Yahweh but both Christians and</text>
  <text start="963.33" dur="4.11">Jews they&amp;#39;re what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="964.77" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re mixing the profane with the with</text>
  <text start="967.44" dur="4.02">the Holy and they&amp;#39;re elevating their own</text>
  <text start="969.54" dur="3.96">traditions above Holy Writ above</text>
  <text start="971.46" dur="5.73">Scripture and it&amp;#39;s a problem that&amp;#39;s both</text>
  <text start="973.5" dur="7.02">you know demak in and Christianity and</text>
  <text start="977.19" dur="5.85">in rabbinic Judaism so what does this</text>
  <text start="980.52" dur="5.07">mean it means that when we read Paul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="983.04" dur="4.35">writings like Romans 14 when we read</text>
  <text start="985.59" dur="3.78">what Yahshua did when he opposed a lot</text>
  <text start="987.39" dur="4.62">of the the rabbinic teachings that were</text>
  <text start="989.37" dur="4.38">going on amongst rabbis we have to</text>
  <text start="992.01" dur="3.63">understand that the essence of the New</text>
  <text start="993.75" dur="4.83">Testament the essence of the renewed</text>
  <text start="995.64" dur="6.3">covenant is this that we obey the Torah</text>
  <text start="998.58" dur="5.82">of Moses out of a love and purity for</text>
  <text start="1001.94" dur="8.19">Yahshua out of an indwelling of a spirit</text>
  <text start="1004.4" dur="7.26">and we shun all the profane and really</text>
  <text start="1010.13" dur="5.37">wicked traditions that are both in</text>
  <text start="1011.66" dur="6.45">Christianity and in Judaism um and you</text>
  <text start="1015.5" dur="4.32">know like Ezekiel says when Ezekiel was</text>
  <text start="1018.11" dur="4.62">prophesying about the New Testament he</text>
  <text start="1019.82" dur="7.29">says very clearly in Ezekiel 1119</text>
  <text start="1022.73" dur="6.06">through 20z 11 19 to 20 he says that the</text>
  <text start="1027.11" dur="4.17">Holy Spirit a new spirit will be given</text>
  <text start="1028.79" dur="5.039">and the Spirit will cause you to walk in</text>
  <text start="1031.28" dur="5.1">my statutes keep my ordinances and do</text>
  <text start="1033.829" dur="3.781">them and they shall be my people that</text>
  <text start="1036.38" dur="3.36">will be there yah so the whole purpose</text>
  <text start="1037.61" dur="4.2">of the Holy Spirit according to Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="1039.74" dur="4.199">is that it causes us to walk in the</text>
  <text start="1041.81" dur="4.8">Torah to keep the commandments in Torah</text>
  <text start="1043.939" dur="5.091">and this is reaffirmed and repeated in</text>
  <text start="1046.61" dur="6.09">the New Testament in Hebrews chapter 8</text>
  <text start="1049.03" dur="4.87">where it says very clearly for this is</text>
  <text start="1052.7" dur="3">the Covenant that I will make with the</text>
  <text start="1053.9" dur="4.95">house of Israel in those days says</text>
  <text start="1055.7" dur="5.16">Yahweh I will put my Torah my laws my</text>
  <text start="1058.85" dur="3.329">Commandments into their mind and write</text>
  <text start="1060.86" dur="2.78">them in their hearts and I will be to</text>
  <text start="1062.179" dur="3.441">them a god makes you leave me a people</text>
  <text start="1063.64" dur="5.25">so he doesn&amp;#39;t do away with the tour of</text>
  <text start="1065.62" dur="5.13">Moses what he does is what formerly this</text>
  <text start="1068.89" dur="4.65">tour was inscribed on parchment and</text>
  <text start="1070.75" dur="4.44">tablets of stone now this torrid by the</text>
