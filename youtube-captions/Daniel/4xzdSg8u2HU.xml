  <text start="26.31" dur="4.73">that is in first Corinthians 11 read</text>
  <text start="28.949" dur="5.911">first Corinthians 11 and then read 1st</text>
  <text start="31.04" dur="5.769">Thessalonians 5 17 says a woman is to</text>
  <text start="34.86" dur="4.62">cover her head with a long feminine veil</text>
  <text start="36.809" dur="4.77">whenever she prays or prophesies and 1st</text>
  <text start="39.48" dur="4.77">Thessalonians 5 17 says we&amp;#39;re always to</text>

  <text start="53.82" dur="6.45">make sure to do that now men okay it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="57.42" dur="6.569">little more complicated to prove this</text>
  <text start="60.27" dur="5.31">but it is in the Torah now if you just</text>
  <text start="63.989" dur="3.751">read first Corinthians 11 on a surface</text>
  <text start="65.58" dur="3.539">level it seems like Paul saying men</text>
  <text start="67.74" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t wear head coverings that</text>
  <text start="69.119" dur="4.741">dishonours your head okay guys Paul</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="4.68">cannot possibly be saying that or else</text>
  <text start="73.86" dur="4.29">he&amp;#39;d be contradicting the Torah okay</text>
  <text start="76.29" dur="4.02">because then he would be saying that</text>
  <text start="78.15" dur="3.509">priests who put on physical head</text>
  <text start="80.31" dur="3.57">coverings bonnets which we can read</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="3.511">about matura they&amp;#39;re commanded to cover</text>
  <text start="83.88" dur="2.79">their heads whenever they do the priests</text>
  <text start="85.17" dur="2.94">of service and that would have been</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="2.909">profane that would have been</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="3.37">dishonouring their heads and of course</text>
  <text start="89.579" dur="4.961">we know they were not</text>
  <text start="91.48" dur="6.42">now the priest wore one hundred percent</text>
  <text start="94.54" dur="5.79">linen head coverings and Yahshua says</text>
  <text start="97.9" dur="6.23">very clearly that he&amp;#39;s called us to be a</text>
  <text start="100.33" dur="6.21">nation of kingdom of kings and priests</text>
  <text start="104.13" dur="4.69">again you go through the entire Tanach</text>
  <text start="106.54" dur="3.24">show me one example of a king or a</text>
  <text start="108.82" dur="3.75">priest who did not wear a head covering</text>
  <text start="109.78" dur="5.31">all the Kings had crowns all the priests</text>
  <text start="112.57" dur="4.68">wear head coverings okay so if I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="117.25" dur="4.07">need to wear a manly head covering this</text>
  <text start="119.44" dur="6">is one hundred percent linen by the way</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="5.26">and the reason it&amp;#39;s linen is because so</text>
  <text start="125.44" dur="3.57">you wouldn&amp;#39;t sweat when you&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="126.58" dur="3.51">temple so since there&amp;#39;s no temple it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.01" dur="2.61">fine if it&amp;#39;s either one hundred percent</text>
  <text start="130.09" dur="2.85">linen or hard percent cotton or a</text>
  <text start="131.62" dur="2.97">hundred percent will make just make sure</text>
  <text start="132.94" dur="3.75">it 100% because you have to work</text>

  <text start="138.6" dur="5.32">men you&amp;#39;ve gotta wear this head covering</text>
  <text start="140.98" dur="4.59">now what Paul is saying in first</text>
  <text start="143.92" dur="3.75">Corinthians Lebanese saying men do not</text>
  <text start="145.57" dur="3.78">wear these long flowing feminine veils</text>
  <text start="147.67" dur="2.79">that women are supposed to wear and he</text>
  <text start="149.35" dur="3.03">even talks about the difference between</text>
  <text start="150.46" dur="3.15">a woman having long hair and a man</text>
  <text start="152.38" dur="3.99">having short hair and how that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="153.61" dur="5.97">picture of you know what type of hat</text>
  <text start="156.37" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;re supposed to wear this is important</text>
  <text start="159.58" dur="4.71">okay wearing a head covering is very</text>
  <text start="161.89" dur="3.99">important because it protects you</text>
  <text start="164.29" dur="4.26">spiritually it&amp;#39;s related to the helmet</text>
  <text start="165.88" dur="4.23">of salvation in Ephesians 6 just like</text>
