  <text start="9.78" dur="5.25">night now of Chanukah that&amp;#39;s beginning</text>
  <text start="11.58" dur="8.09">tonight December the 21st 2014 heading</text>
  <text start="15.03" dur="7.89">into the sixth day of Hanukkah and I</text>
  <text start="19.67" dur="7.9">just I wanted just to talk real briefly</text>
  <text start="22.92" dur="7.65">that there&amp;#39;s a movement in the in the</text>
  <text start="27.57" dur="5.34">Messianic circles at least some of the</text>
  <text start="30.57" dur="3.75">Messianic circles where people in the</text>
  <text start="32.91" dur="3.45">Hebrew roots and Messier movements are</text>
  <text start="34.32" dur="4.259">saying that you know we shouldn&amp;#39;t keep</text>
  <text start="36.36" dur="4.82">Hanukkah because it&amp;#39;s not one of the</text>
  <text start="38.579" dur="5.491">seven feasts that&amp;#39;s in Leviticus 23 and</text>
  <text start="41.18" dur="4.539">it was sort of added in by the Jews and</text>
  <text start="44.07" dur="3.09">it&amp;#39;s a very Jewish feast and doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="45.719" dur="4.081">have anything to do with the Torah per</text>
  <text start="47.16" dur="3.809">se and and you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of a</text>
  <text start="49.8" dur="3.36">lot of different people who are saying</text>
  <text start="50.969" dur="4.11">that and I just want to say that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="53.16" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s completely wrong first of all we</text>
  <text start="55.079" dur="4.8">know Hanukkah is a biblical feast</text>
  <text start="57.12" dur="5.79">because Yahshua observed Hanukkah we can</text>
  <text start="59.879" dur="5.341">see that very clearly in John 10:22 I</text>
  <text start="62.91" dur="4.11">mean Yasha went right up not only to</text>
  <text start="65.22" dur="3.96">Jerusalem but right up to the temple to</text>
  <text start="67.02" dur="4.529">teach and to contend with the Pharisees</text>
  <text start="69.18" dur="3.96">and he wouldn&amp;#39;t have gone up there where</text>
  <text start="71.549" dur="3.601">you know basically that would have been</text>
  <text start="73.14" dur="3.869">the nerve center of all the celebrations</text>
  <text start="75.15" dur="3.6">and festivities for Chanukah for the</text>
  <text start="77.009" dur="3.031">feast of dedication he wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="78.75" dur="3.59">gone up there and associated himself</text>
  <text start="80.04" dur="6.149">with that celebration if he didn&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="82.34" dur="7.27">we as believers in yah should keep that</text>
  <text start="86.189" dur="6.801">feast so so definitely it is definitely</text>
  <text start="89.61" dur="5.85">a feast to be kept yes it was instituted</text>
  <text start="92.99" dur="4.089">you know between the end of the writing</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="5.19">of the snoc and the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="97.079" dur="5.97">renewed covenant but it&amp;#39;s a historical</text>
  <text start="100.65" dur="4.829">thing that happened as recorded in first</text>
  <text start="103.049" dur="4.941">and second Maccabees it&amp;#39;s definitely an</text>
  <text start="105.479" dur="5.041">awesome victory given to the Jews who</text>
  <text start="107.99" dur="4.87">devoted themselves to jaan the Torah and</text>
  <text start="110.52" dur="4.77">yah gave them you know amazing victory</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="6">over this incredibly powerful Greek</text>
  <text start="115.29" dur="6.42">Empire and the fact that Yahshua kept</text>
  <text start="118.86" dur="4.799">this feast and taught at the temple</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="4.979">specifically on this feast and that the</text>
  <text start="123.659" dur="4.77">Apostle John specifically notes that</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="5.041">it&amp;#39;s the feasts of dedication Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="128.429" dur="4.551">that Yahshua is teaching I mean all of</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="4.399">those facts just point</text>
  <text start="132.98" dur="5.25">toward the importance of this feast and</text>
  <text start="136.129" dur="3.661">yes there are some pagan elements that</text>
  <text start="138.23" dur="5.039">have seeped into this feast in</text>
  <text start="139.79" dur="4.86">modern-day judaism but you know again as</text>
  <text start="143.269" dur="3.481">i think i mentioned on the first night</text>
  <text start="144.65" dur="5.64">of Chanukah you can remove those pagan</text>
  <text start="146.75" dur="5.94">elements and come back to the purity of</text>
  <text start="150.29" dur="4.199">Chanukah and keep it in the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.69" dur="3.689">supposed to be kept it is a feast of</text>
  <text start="154.489" dur="4.621">dedication of rededicating your heart to</text>
  <text start="156.379" dur="5.19">yah a feast of cleansing and purity and</text>
  <text start="159.11" dur="4.65">getting pure before yah staying pure</text>
  <text start="161.569" dur="4.441">before ya cleansing out your temples and</text>
  <text start="163.76" dur="5.729">it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a joyous feast it&amp;#39;s a time</text>
  <text start="166.01" dur="4.86">to you know buy good food and sing and</text>
  <text start="169.489" dur="3.03">dance and be with your friends and</text>
  <text start="170.87" dur="3.869">family and you know it&amp;#39;s a time of great</text>
  <text start="172.519" dur="4.8">joy and celebration it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a second</text>
  <text start="174.739" dur="5.521">Sukkot as I talked about last night so I</text>
  <text start="177.319" dur="4.471">firmly reject all messianic sore Hebrew</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="4.5">roots people who say that we should not</text>
  <text start="181.79" dur="4.919">keep Chanukah I think Chanukah is just</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="4.5">as important as the seven major feasts</text>
  <text start="186.709" dur="4.59">in Leviticus 23 just as important as</text>
  <text start="189.26" dur="3.99">Passover or Sukkot and I believe</text>
  <text start="191.299" dur="4.131">Hanukkah will have a prophetic</text>
  <text start="193.25" dur="4.68">significance just like Apostle Paul</text>
  <text start="195.43" dur="5.26">Sowell talks about in Colossians 2 that</text>
  <text start="197.93" dur="5.1">these feasts are shadows of things to</text>
  <text start="200.69" dur="3.96">come I think he&amp;#39;s also referring to</text>
  <text start="203.03" dur="3.929">Chanukah the feasts of dedication that</text>
  <text start="204.65" dur="3.989">this feast will have a future</text>
  <text start="206.959" dur="5.101">fulfillment and specifically I believe</text>
  <text start="208.639" dur="6.69">that the temple that Yahshua builds and</text>
  <text start="212.06" dur="5.07">will be administrating over ruling over</text>
  <text start="215.329" dur="4.171">in the Millennial Kingdom I believe that</text>
  <text start="217.13" dur="4.889">that temple will be dedicated on the</text>
  <text start="219.5" dur="3.95">first very first Hanukkah of the 1,000</text>
  <text start="222.019" dur="3.511">year reign of the Millennial Kingdom I</text>
  <text start="223.45" dur="3.49">believe that very strongly I think</text>
  <text start="225.53" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s one way Chanukah is going to be</text>
  <text start="226.94" dur="6.06">used prophetically in the end times</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="6.12">so please celebrate this festival it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.4" dur="4.559">supposed to be doing Christmas is a</text>
  <text start="237.23" dur="4.11">counterfeit of Hanukkah Hanukkah is what</text>
  <text start="239.959" dur="3.75">Yahshua wants his people to be doing</text>
  <text start="241.34" dur="4.679">this is Daniel John Lee with tor</text>
