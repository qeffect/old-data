  <text start="31.529" dur="4.081">it happens starting tomorrow night and</text>
  <text start="33.48" dur="4.07">I&amp;#39;ve been getting a lot of comments on</text>
  <text start="35.61" dur="4.34">my youtube videos on my Facebook page</text>
  <text start="37.55" dur="4.9">about people saying well how do you know</text>
  <text start="39.95" dur="3.609">that the feasts of trumpets occurs</text>
  <text start="42.45" dur="2.31">tomorrow night how do you know when the</text>
  <text start="43.559" dur="3.09">new moon is I mean don&amp;#39;t you have to go</text>
  <text start="44.76" dur="3.69">out and site the new moon and and all</text>
  <text start="46.649" dur="3.811">this stuff now I have a lot of articles</text>
  <text start="48.45" dur="3.539">on my website and I&amp;#39;ve made videos in</text>
  <text start="50.46" dur="3.509">the past about this but I just felt</text>
  <text start="51.989" dur="4.111">impressed by the spirit to make another</text>
  <text start="53.969" dur="4.73">video just to make this crystal clear</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="5.459">and this is just gonna sort of be a very</text>
  <text start="58.699" dur="4.601">short and sweet teaching that takes all</text>
  <text start="61.559" dur="2.971">the stuff that I have on my website in</text>
  <text start="63.3" dur="2.28">fact I have an article that I&amp;#39;ll put on</text>
  <text start="64.53" dur="2.82">the bottom of this video</text>
  <text start="65.58" dur="3.51">that&amp;#39;s very lengthy and goes through a</text>
  <text start="67.35" dur="3.839">lot of Scripture to prove this but I</text>
  <text start="69.09" dur="5.7">want to make this as succinct and as</text>
  <text start="71.189" dur="6.271">clear as possible so I&amp;#39;m just gonna make</text>
  <text start="74.79" dur="6.719">this video as the spirit leaves but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="5.54">probably just gonna be very short so the</text>
  <text start="81.509" dur="4.021">first thing I want to start off with is</text>
  <text start="83" dur="5.53">when you say oh you know don&amp;#39;t we have</text>
  <text start="85.53" dur="5.129">to wait for to see the Crescent in the</text>
  <text start="88.53" dur="3.72">sky and you know two witnesses have to</text>
  <text start="90.659" dur="4.411">go out and see it and they come back and</text>
  <text start="92.25" dur="4.799">report it and all this stuff well I want</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="4.17">you to pick up your Bible and I want you</text>
  <text start="97.049" dur="4.741">to show me one example just one example</text>
  <text start="99.24" dur="5.22">from Genesis through revelation where</text>
  <text start="101.79" dur="4.109">you see anyone ever going outside to</text>
  <text start="104.46" dur="4.019">look at the first Crescent of the new</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="4.801">moon and then they announce it just find</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="4.861">one scripture you will not find it</text>
  <text start="110.7" dur="4.739">anywhere okay this was done after the</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="3.66">Babylonian exile it is recorded in</text>
  <text start="115.439" dur="4.14">Talmud that this was a tradition that</text>
  <text start="117" dur="5.159">the Jews started doing but it was it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="119.579" dur="4.591">not found in Scripture now let&amp;#39;s go to</text>
  <text start="122.159" dur="6.21">the scriptural way of determining the</text>
  <text start="124.17" dur="6.539">new moon I want you to go to Psalm 81</text>
  <text start="128.369" dur="3.571">verse 3 where it says blow up the</text>
  <text start="130.709" dur="3.961">trumpet in the new</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="5.04">in the time appointed on our solemn</text>
  <text start="134.67" dur="4.98">feast day so this is clearly talking</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="4.47">about a new moon and that word I want</text>
  <text start="139.65" dur="6.47">you to look at this verse very carefully</text>
  <text start="141.45" dur="7.77">that Hebrew word in Psalm 81 three four</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="6.43">appointed do you guys know what that</text>
  <text start="149.22" dur="5.73">word means appointed that word a pointed</text>
  <text start="152.55" dur="6.12">comes from the Hebrew word kept cassette</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="6.78">or key said which is from the work</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="7.05">kasa and this word actually means to</text>
  <text start="161.73" dur="6.72">cover to conceal to hide so literally</text>
  <text start="165.72" dur="5.4">the psalmist is saying at the snow moon</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="3.75">in which we blow up the trumpet and by</text>
  <text start="171.12" dur="4.08">the way you always blow up the trumpet</text>
  <text start="172.2" dur="4.53">on a new moon and especially on the</text>
  <text start="175.2" dur="3.84">Feast of Trumpets the seventh new moon</text>
  <text start="176.73" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s literally saying that on this time</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="4.65">this time appointed it is a time of</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="4.65">concealment of hiding of darkness in</text>
  <text start="183.69" dur="7.44">other words when the moon is completely</text>
  <text start="185.46" dur="8.61">hidden completely dark now the</text>
  <text start="191.13" dur="4.859">conjunction happens one one time every</text>
  <text start="194.07" dur="4.05">month it has been said exact moment when</text>
  <text start="195.989" dur="2.881">the Sun Earth and Moon are all in</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="2.97">perfect alignment</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="4.2">you don&amp;#39;t need NASA to figure out the</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="3.899">moment of conjunction even ancient</text>
  <text start="203.07" dur="4.34">civilizations were able to figure out</text>
  <text start="204.989" dur="4.651">when the conjunction would occur and</text>
  <text start="207.41" dur="3.73">when that happens and it happens every</text>
  <text start="209.64" dur="3.27">month is once particular moment when</text>
  <text start="211.14" dur="3.53">that conjunction happens the following</text>
  <text start="212.91" dur="3.81">sunset begins the day of the new moon</text>
  <text start="214.67" dur="4.33">when that conjunction happens whatever</text>
  <text start="216.72" dur="3.87">time it is in Israel the following</text>
  <text start="219" dur="2.519">sunset begins the new moon just like</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="2.79">when Shabbat</text>
  <text start="221.519" dur="3.811">begins on Friday night in Israel and</text>
  <text start="223.38" dur="4.92">then it begins on Friday night as the</text>
  <text start="225.33" dur="5.52">time zones as the Sun sets all across</text>
  <text start="228.3" dur="6.09">the time zones across the earth so to</text>
  <text start="230.85" dur="6.27">the new moon begins the evening</text>
  <text start="234.39" dur="5.22">following that moment of conjunction now</text>
  <text start="237.12" dur="4.05">mmm people will say well Daniel know you</text>
  <text start="239.61" dur="3.21">really you have to go outside you have</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="4.77">to see the first sliver of the new moon</text>
  <text start="242.82" dur="5.28">okay I want you that there&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="245.94" dur="4.769">word for crescent and in fact it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="248.1" dur="6.68">word that&amp;#39;s often used for a crescent</text>
  <text start="250.709" dur="9.871">moon and I want you to turn to Isaiah</text>
  <text start="254.78" dur="7.54">3:18 as a a318 because the word crescent</text>
  <text start="260.58" dur="3.18">is used here and I want you to see how</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="3.03">it&amp;#39;s used</text>
  <text start="263.76" dur="4.16">I&amp;#39;m just gonna turn to it here in my</text>
  <text start="265.35" dur="8.76">Bible give me just a moment</text>
  <text start="267.92" dur="8.11">Isaiah 3 verse 18 says this in that day</text>
  <text start="274.11" dur="4.8">Yahweh will take away the bravery of</text>
  <text start="276.03" dur="4.77">their tinkling ornaments about their</text>
  <text start="278.91" dur="4.8">feet and their calls and their round</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="5.61">tires like the moon now some</text>
  <text start="283.71" dur="6.18">translations will literally say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.41" dur="5.49">round tires or their crescent moons but</text>
  <text start="289.89" dur="5.13">that moon right there is translated as</text>
  <text start="291.9" dur="5.1">saw her own which means moon crescent or</text>
  <text start="295.02" dur="3.39">ornament it literally refers to a</text>
  <text start="297" dur="4.8">crescent moon these were this was pagan</text>
  <text start="298.41" dur="6.63">jewelry that the apostate Israelites</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="5.49">were wearing and by the way that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="305.04" dur="3.63">Islam has this symbol of the crescent</text>
  <text start="307.29" dur="4.59">moon because it&amp;#39;s pagan it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="308.67" dur="6.57">pagan in origin so that word saw her own</text>
  <text start="311.88" dur="6.09">it is never ever ever used to describe</text>
  <text start="315.24" dur="4.56">the new moon so think about that we have</text>
  <text start="317.97" dur="4.38">a hebrew word that actually means</text>
  <text start="319.8" dur="5.46">crescent moon and yet it&amp;#39;s never ever</text>
  <text start="322.35" dur="4.86">used ever used to describe the new moon</text>
  <text start="325.26" dur="6.21">in fact if you go back to that verse i</text>
  <text start="327.21" dur="6.69">was pointing at the psalm 81 3 the word</text>
  <text start="331.47" dur="5.4">he uses they&amp;#39;re actually four moon there</text>
  <text start="333.9" dur="5.58">is Kadesh or yacon - which comes from</text>
  <text start="336.87" dur="5.94">Kadosh which literally means renew</text>
  <text start="339.48" dur="5.31">repair be new to bring back now he could</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="3.72">have easily used saw her own there if he</text>
  <text start="344.79" dur="3.54">wanted us to if he said blow up the</text>
  <text start="346.53" dur="3">trumpet when you see that first Crescent</text>
  <text start="348.33" dur="3.48">he could have used saw her own because</text>
  <text start="349.53" dur="4.29">that Hebrew word accurately describes</text>
  <text start="351.81" dur="4.41">the first Crescent of a moon but he</text>
  <text start="353.82" dur="5.88">didn&amp;#39;t he didn&amp;#39;t use that word and said</text>
  <text start="356.22" dur="5.37">he used the word repair renew be new and</text>
  <text start="359.7" dur="3.66">then he used the word appointed which</text>
  <text start="361.59" dur="5.25">literally means to cover to conceal to</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="6">hide just as the Hebrew day begins in</text>
  <text start="366.84" dur="4.62">darkness so the Hebrew month begins when</text>
  <text start="369.36" dur="5.73">that moon is completely in darkness and</text>
  <text start="371.46" dur="6.21">by the way back in 2014 and 2015 you</text>
  <text start="375.09" dur="3.78">remember those blood red moons well the</text>
  <text start="377.67" dur="3.51">only way you would have been able to</text>
  <text start="378.87" dur="4.56">keep the feast days on the day of the</text>
  <text start="381.18" dur="4.02">blood red moons is if you follow the</text>
  <text start="383.43" dur="3.69">conjunction because when you follow</text>
  <text start="385.2" dur="3.69">conjunction and you start the day of the</text>
  <text start="387.12" dur="3.87">new moon the sunset following them up in</text>
  <text start="388.89" dur="4.8">conjunction that first day of Passover</text>
  <text start="390.99" dur="6.179">or that first day of Sukkot will always</text>
  <text start="393.69" dur="5.37">fall on the full moon it won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="397.169" dur="3.601">almost a full moon or past a full moon</text>
  <text start="399.06" dur="3.289">it will be the exact full moon and</text>
  <text start="400.77" dur="5.009">that&amp;#39;s when those blood moons occurred</text>
  <text start="402.349" dur="5.59">that only would have happened that only</text>
  <text start="405.779" dur="5.1">would have happened if you followed</text>
  <text start="407.939" dur="5.76">conjunction not Crescent so I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.879" dur="6.15">very clear from both Psalm 81 3 and from</text>
  <text start="413.699" dur="5.791">this chapter in in Isaiah Isaiah 3 that</text>
  <text start="417.029" dur="4.23">the crescent is not what we&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="419.49" dur="4.59">to be following but it&amp;#39;s conjunction and</text>
  <text start="421.259" dur="6.451">this year the moment of conjunction in</text>
  <text start="424.08" dur="4.709">Israel I&amp;#39;ll have to check my website</text>
  <text start="427.71" dur="2.37">there&amp;#39;s actually a website you can go to</text>
  <text start="428.789" dur="2.551">on time of date where you can check when</text>
  <text start="430.08" dur="3.41">the moment of conjunction happens but in</text>
  <text start="431.34" dur="4.889">any case I know it happens before</text>
  <text start="433.49" dur="4.03">tomorrow sunset and so that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="436.229" dur="5.011">day of the new moon begins tomorrow</text>
  <text start="437.52" dur="5.28">night the whole calendar happens to be</text>
  <text start="441.24" dur="3.84">in perfect alignment with this true</text>
  <text start="442.8" dur="4.139">scriptural calendar so phrase yeah</text>
  <text start="445.08" dur="3.389">all the Jews following the Hallel</text>
  <text start="446.939" dur="3.061">calendar are also gonna be fine</text>
  <text start="448.469" dur="4.88">following the true scriptural calendar</text>
  <text start="450" dur="6.33">so praise yah this is the true calendar</text>
  <text start="453.349" dur="4.54">and I believe this is the the way that</text>
  <text start="456.33" dur="2.94">God wants us to start the month now</text>
  <text start="457.889" dur="3.661">there have been some people making</text>
  <text start="459.27" dur="4.98">comments that said well Daniel we really</text>
  <text start="461.55" dur="4.829">can&amp;#39;t know for sure and Messiah will</text>
  <text start="464.25" dur="3.779">clear this up so I understand that</text>
  <text start="466.379" dur="3.871">Messiah is definitely gonna clear a lot</text>
  <text start="468.029" dur="3.901">of things up when your returns but when</text>
  <text start="470.25" dur="3.06">it comes to actually determining how</text>
  <text start="471.93" dur="3.359">we&amp;#39;re supposed to start the Hebrew month</text>
  <text start="473.31" dur="3.599">which basically determines when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="475.289" dur="4.141">supposed to keep the annual high</text>
  <text start="476.909" dur="4.861">Sabbath&amp;#39;s I think y&amp;#39;all wants us to make</text>
  <text start="479.43" dur="3.93">be very clear to have a lot of clarity</text>
  <text start="481.77" dur="3.299">on how to do this and personally I think</text>
  <text start="483.36" dur="4.049">he&amp;#39;s made it very simple he&amp;#39;s made it</text>
  <text start="485.069" dur="4.681">very clear I just used these two verses</text>
  <text start="487.409" dur="5.461">I can use a bunch more and in fact that</text>
  <text start="489.75" dur="4.189">article below the video uses and goes</text>
  <text start="492.87" dur="3.329">through a bunch more scriptures</text>
  <text start="493.939" dur="4.361">including a really good passage in 1st</text>
  <text start="496.199" dur="3.18">Samuel with David and Jonathan so Burt</text>
  <text start="498.3" dur="4.079">in the Newman that also proves</text>
  <text start="499.379" dur="4.891">conjunction but and you can go in there</text>
  <text start="502.379" dur="4.621">but but I think the truth is always very</text>
  <text start="504.27" dur="4.739">simple it&amp;#39;s very childlike you even a</text>
  <text start="507" dur="4.199">child could understand it which is why</text>
  <text start="509.009" dur="3.481">Yahshua said unless you become like a</text>
  <text start="511.199" dur="3.84">little child you shall in no wise</text>
  <text start="512.49" dur="5.159">inherit the kingdom of yah and be</text>
  <text start="515.039" dur="4.29">converted so I think it&amp;#39;s very simple</text>
  <text start="517.649" dur="3.031">and this makes it very simple when I</text>
  <text start="519.329" dur="2.7">watch these crescent moon errs there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="520.68" dur="3.029">so much confusion I mean they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="522.029" dur="2.701">well there was clouds on the sky so we</text>
  <text start="523.709" dur="2.551">didn&amp;#39;t see the crescent moon tonight</text>
  <text start="524.73" dur="2.969">well start tomorrow and then oh well we</text>
  <text start="526.26" dur="2.73">saw crescent moon over here in Missouri</text>
  <text start="527.699" dur="3.211">but we didn&amp;#39;t see a crescent moon over</text>
  <text start="528.99" dur="3.24">here in Oregon well was there</text>
  <text start="530.91" dur="2.49">someone in Israel I don&amp;#39;t know in</text>
  <text start="532.23" dur="2.25">northern Israel they couldn&amp;#39;t see the</text>
  <text start="533.4" dur="2.19">crescent moon but in southern Israel</text>
  <text start="534.48" dur="2.49">they could because there&amp;#39;s no cloud</text>
  <text start="535.59" dur="3.57">cover it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s just mass confusion</text>
  <text start="536.97" dur="4.77">with the conjunction that moment a</text>
  <text start="539.16" dur="4.44">conjunction happens at one moment in</text>
  <text start="541.74" dur="3.72">time you just find out what time it is</text>
  <text start="543.6" dur="4.02">in Israel at that moment follow the</text>
  <text start="545.46" dur="3.54">following sunset and boom you got your</text>
  <text start="547.62" dur="4.11">day of the new moon it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="549" dur="5.4">simple and it allows everyone everyone</text>
  <text start="551.73" dur="4.22">to follow the same calendar so I hope</text>
  <text start="554.4" dur="4.44">this helped and cleared up that issue</text>
