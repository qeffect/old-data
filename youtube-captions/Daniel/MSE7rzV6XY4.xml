  <text start="75.33" dur="2.64">that I&amp;#39;m bringing this up on Shabbat</text>

  <text start="77.97" dur="8.1">glorifying him so everything will be</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="6.119">fine so basically what happened was is</text>
  <text start="86.07" dur="5.28">so I work at a place where I set</text>
  <text start="88.979" dur="4.53">appointments for real estate agents and</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="5.28">I do get a base salary but then I get</text>
  <text start="93.509" dur="4.29">commission based off any appointments</text>
  <text start="96.63" dur="2.64">that actually turn into listings that</text>
  <text start="97.799" dur="4.981">actually turn into house that either are</text>
  <text start="99.27" dur="5.19">sold or a bot now the base salaries not</text>
  <text start="102.78" dur="5.25">really enough to live on so you really</text>
  <text start="104.46" dur="4.979">have to make the Commission&amp;#39;s i had just</text>
  <text start="108.03" dur="3.089">to give you some idea of how long it</text>
  <text start="109.439" dur="3.511">takes i had set this particular</text>

  <text start="115.95" dur="5.099">April fourth and then I got my</text>
  <text start="118.77" dur="4.65">commission check this week so it takes a</text>
  <text start="121.049" dur="4.311">long time for this to happen the problem</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="5.13">was I had I had been very blessed</text>
  <text start="125.36" dur="5.56">financially but I paid a lot of my bills</text>
  <text start="128.55" dur="3.75">that I needed to pay obviously and i was</text>
  <text start="130.92" dur="2.46">expecting this commission check to come</text>
  <text start="132.3" dur="3.36">because the house</text>
  <text start="133.38" dur="4.17">may the 12th which was last Thursday and</text>
  <text start="135.66" dur="3.17">he usually takes about two to three days</text>
  <text start="137.55" dur="4.92">for that commission check to show up</text>
  <text start="138.83" dur="5.08">well two to three days came and went</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="3.93">monday and tuesday and there was no</text>
  <text start="143.91" dur="6.12">commission check and i literally had you</text>

  <text start="150.03" dur="3.93">account because i was expecting that</text>
  <text start="152.37" dur="3.18">commission check and I&amp;#39;d budgeted in to</text>
  <text start="153.96" dur="3.78">arrive when it typically arrives but it</text>
  <text start="155.55" dur="5.22">didn&amp;#39;t and I was like oh my goodness</text>
  <text start="157.74" dur="5.1">what am I going to do now on Tuesday I</text>

  <text start="166.59" dur="6.03">dinner there that was provided so I had</text>
  <text start="169.17" dur="4.71">I had a meal that that night the next</text>
  <text start="172.62" dur="2.94">day on Wednesday when i&amp;#39;m at work</text>

  <text start="187.8" dur="3.3">am I gonna do and I searched my</text>
  <text start="189.6" dur="3">cupboards because I didn&amp;#39;t really have</text>
  <text start="191.1" dur="2.97">any food available but I had just</text>
  <text start="192.6" dur="4.32">recently cleaned out my house for</text>
  <text start="194.07" dur="4.68">unleavened bread a few weeks ago and</text>
  <text start="196.92" dur="4.65">there was still this big old bag of rice</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="4.8">that i had so i used the rice and i use</text>
  <text start="201.57" dur="3.33">some butter than i had and then i used</text>
  <text start="203.55" dur="3.57">some tillamook cheese that I had in the</text>
  <text start="204.9" dur="5.01">refrigerator just whatever I had left</text>
  <text start="207.12" dur="6">and I had a meal it was very very</text>
  <text start="209.91" dur="6.96">filling um and i did and i did that for</text>
  <text start="213.12" dur="6.18">both yeah for wednesday night and did it</text>

  <text start="220.83" dur="4.02">know i know tuesday night i had a meal</text>

  <text start="224.85" dur="4.2">night and wednesday night and then</text>
  <text start="225.75" dur="5.64">thursday it was the pretty much the only</text>
  <text start="229.05" dur="4.32">day i had to kind of fast the whole day</text>
  <text start="231.39" dur="4.83">and then that check finally arrived</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="5.4">thursday afternoon so my point is is</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="5.1">that yah sustain me now here&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="238.77" dur="5.88">else I could have used my credit card</text>
  <text start="241.32" dur="4.47">because I had some I had the ability to</text>
  <text start="244.65" dur="2.46">use it but I didn&amp;#39;t want to use my</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="3.74">credit card I didn&amp;#39;t want to continue to</text>
  <text start="247.11" dur="5.04">use it and you know a crew interest i</text>
  <text start="249.53" dur="4.9">paid off when i needed to pay off and</text>
  <text start="252.15" dur="4.05">but i still have quite a big a bit of a</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="4.14">balance on it and I didn&amp;#39;t want to keep</text>
  <text start="256.2" dur="3.72">you know having to pay off the same</text>
  <text start="258.57" dur="2.88">amount every month so I wanted to keep</text>
  <text start="259.92" dur="4.7">that so i can actually start making</text>
  <text start="261.45" dur="4.97">progress on paying that thing off and</text>
  <text start="264.62" dur="4.98">yah sustained</text>

  <text start="494.42" dur="7.32">teaching by a guy named David possum he</text>
  <text start="497.42" dur="5.46">does this topic teachout Habakkuk part 1</text>
  <text start="501.74" dur="3.3">and part 2 I don&amp;#39;t agree with everything</text>
  <text start="502.88" dur="4.89">he says but he says this really cool</text>
  <text start="505.04" dur="5.94">thing where he talks about how if you go</text>
  <text start="507.77" dur="5.13">walking around the Sea of Galilee you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="510.98" dur="3.689">find that almost all the cities that</text>
  <text start="512.9" dur="3.42">used to be around there are in ruins now</text>
  <text start="514.669" dur="4.531">because those are the cities and towns</text>
  <text start="516.32" dur="5.34">that Yahshua the Messiah cursed said woe</text>
  <text start="519.2" dur="4.29">unto you Bethsaida what would you capron</text>
  <text start="521.66" dur="3.27">up those are little curses that yah she</text>
  <text start="523.49" dur="2.88">was speaking on these cities because</text>
  <text start="524.93" dur="3.96">they refuse to repent and acknowledge</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="4.32">who Yahshua was the Messiah and now</text>
  <text start="528.89" dur="2.879">they&amp;#39;re in ruins and the only city he</text>
  <text start="530.69" dur="3.54">did not curse</text>
  <text start="531.769" dur="4.531">was Tiberius and Tiberius is still this</text>
  <text start="534.23" dur="4.56">thriving town and city along the shores</text>
  <text start="536.3" dur="4.529">of Galilee to this day so I thought that</text>
  <text start="538.79" dur="3.659">was really really cool and what that</text>
  <text start="540.829" dur="4.05">shows is you know a lot of people take</text>
  <text start="542.449" dur="3.661">the book of James out of context which</text>
  <text start="544.879" dur="2.43">says we&amp;#39;re never supposed to cursed</text>
  <text start="546.11" dur="4.229">we&amp;#39;re only supposed to bless with her</text>
  <text start="547.309" dur="5.911">mouth again sometimes the best blessing</text>
  <text start="550.339" dur="4.62">we can speak out is a curse if it&amp;#39;s if</text>
  <text start="553.22" dur="3.089">it&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s evil if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="554.959" dur="2.85">someone that needs to repent and maybe</text>
