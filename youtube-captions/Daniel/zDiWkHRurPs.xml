  <text start="10.74" dur="4.38">Sabbath that only happens once a year</text>
  <text start="12.54" dur="5.19">Feast of Trumpets yom teruah the day of</text>
  <text start="15.12" dur="4.98">blasting of the trumpets and again as</text>
  <text start="17.73" dur="4.379">isaiah 58:1 says it says lift up your</text>
  <text start="20.1" dur="4.23">voice like a trumpet and show the</text>
  <text start="22.109" dur="3.66">transgression of my people and I know a</text>
  <text start="24.33" dur="4.92">lot of people have been getting offended</text>
  <text start="25.769" dur="4.77">by my exposing of what Mark Taylor said</text>
  <text start="29.25" dur="2.609">now if you haven&amp;#39;t seen my video from</text>
  <text start="30.539" dur="4.2">last night you can go watch it I</text>
  <text start="31.859" dur="4.561">actually show the actual video clip of</text>
  <text start="34.739" dur="4.621">what Mark Taylor says so no one can</text>
  <text start="36.42" dur="5.159">accuse me of misquoting Mark Taylor Mark</text>
  <text start="39.36" dur="4.68">Taylor clearly says that we cannot trust</text>
  <text start="41.579" dur="5.281">the the present-day Canon of the Bible</text>
  <text start="44.04" dur="5.339">that there are hidden Scrolls hidden</text>
  <text start="46.86" dur="3.449">books things that have still not yet</text>
  <text start="49.379" dur="3">been released</text>
  <text start="50.309" dur="5.281">that are gonna add some some greater</text>
  <text start="52.379" dur="4.5">clarity to the Bible so and people also</text>
  <text start="55.59" dur="3.57">accuse me of getting really upset and</text>
  <text start="56.879" dur="4.5">angry guys I&amp;#39;m upset and angry because</text>
  <text start="59.16" dur="3.78">when you attack the validity of the</text>
  <text start="61.379" dur="4.74">Scriptures the validity of the Canon</text>
  <text start="62.94" dur="5.46">this opens up all whole Pandora&amp;#39;s box</text>
  <text start="66.119" dur="4.32">that will empower the Satanic pedophiles</text>
  <text start="68.4" dur="3.39">by the way so this directly dovetails</text>
  <text start="70.439" dur="4.771">into my mission of defending the little</text>
  <text start="71.79" dur="5.88">children I want to play something and</text>
  <text start="75.21" dur="3.9">again I know people are saying I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="3.9">getting too emotional about this on it</text>
  <text start="79.11" dur="3.899">do my best remain as calm as possible to</text>
  <text start="81.57" dur="3.57">prove that I&amp;#39;m doing this out of a love</text>
  <text start="83.009" dur="4.47">for the Word of God and a love for God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="4.32">people for yaws people so that you can</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="3.75">know the truth so I want I want to play</text>
  <text start="89.46" dur="7.589">this first and I&amp;#39;ll provide a link for</text>
  <text start="91.229" dur="8.941">this you guys can save this as well what</text>
  <text start="97.049" dur="6.331">are the best biblical answers for why</text>
  <text start="100.17" dur="6.03">these 66 books that we protestants</text>
  <text start="103.38" dur="5.55">clearly recognize as authoritative or</text>
  <text start="106.2" dur="4.169">the actual god-breathed word tell us</text>
  <text start="108.93" dur="2.61">great question what I try to encourage</text>
  <text start="110.369" dur="2.46">people do when they answer those</text>
  <text start="111.54" dur="2.88">questions is to break it into little</text>
  <text start="112.829" dur="3">chunks so rather than talking about the</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="3.39">whole Bible at one time I encourage</text>
  <text start="115.829" dur="3.36">people to take smaller parts and usually</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="2.82">starting with the four Gospels is a good</text>
  <text start="119.189" dur="3.301">way to do that because the Gospels talk</text>
  <text start="120.63" dur="3.51">about Jesus people are interested in the</text>
  <text start="122.49" dur="3.33">Gospels inherently and so usually I say</text>
  <text start="124.14" dur="3.45">look just memorize a couple key facts</text>
  <text start="125.82" dur="2.82">about the Gospels and you&amp;#39;ll get a lot</text>
  <text start="127.59" dur="2.729">of headway with people in regard to</text>
  <text start="128.64" dur="4.11">Canon I&amp;#39;ll give you one of those key</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="3.871">facts the four Gospels in Arkana</text>
  <text start="132.75" dur="3.06">Matthew Mark Luke and John are the only</text>
  <text start="134.19" dur="3.81">Gospels we have that come from the first</text>
  <text start="135.81" dur="2.85">century mm-hmm there&amp;#39;s a simple fact the</text>
  <text start="138" dur="2.13">earlier the better</text>
  <text start="138.66" dur="2.97">earlier the better and they&amp;#39;re the only</text>
  <text start="140.13" dur="2.76">ones we have from that time period and</text>
  <text start="141.63" dur="3.03">so you look at all the apocryphal</text>
  <text start="142.89" dur="3.21">Gospels like Thomas and Peter and so on</text>
  <text start="144.66" dur="3.09">whatever you might say about those</text>
  <text start="146.1" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re not first century Gospels and</text>
  <text start="147.75" dur="3.39">they can never therefore been written by</text>
  <text start="149.1" dur="3.72">an eyewitness and so when all said and</text>
  <text start="151.14" dur="3.24">done just the one fact that the only</text>
  <text start="152.82" dur="2.37">four Gospels that we have are from the</text>
  <text start="154.38" dur="2.37">first century</text>
  <text start="155.19" dur="2.76">Matthew more Luke and John that gives us</text>
  <text start="156.75" dur="2.61">a reason to think that they have at</text>
  <text start="157.95" dur="2.85">least a good starting point for being</text>
  <text start="159.36" dur="3.45">authentic and what about the the</text>
  <text start="160.8" dur="4.08">epistles the New Testament epistles yeah</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="3.929">same thing in fact the 27 books of our</text>
  <text start="164.88" dur="2.88">New Testament are the earliest Christian</text>
  <text start="166.739" dur="3.331">writings we have across the board</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s no other Christian writing we</text>
  <text start="170.07" dur="4.11">possess the dates of the first century</text>
  <text start="171.93" dur="3.63">other than the New Testament there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.18" dur="2.58">only one exception that that comes close</text>
  <text start="175.56" dur="2.79">and it&amp;#39;s a book called first Clement</text>
  <text start="176.76" dur="3.21">which dates at the very end of the first</text>
  <text start="178.35" dur="2.76">century though other than that if you</text>
  <text start="179.97" dur="2.61">want to know about first century</text>
  <text start="181.11" dur="2.61">Christianity the only books you have or</text>
  <text start="182.58" dur="2.94">the New Testament books Paul&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="183.72" dur="2.4">Paul&amp;#39;s writings are the earliest yes</text>
  <text start="185.52" dur="2.189">absolutely</text>
  <text start="186.12" dur="3.78">I&amp;#39;ve never layer them the Gospels yes</text>
  <text start="187.709" dur="3.811">there&amp;#39;s a debate about whether Galatians</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="3.059">as early as for chains as early as to</text>
  <text start="191.52" dur="3.719">putting on which scholar you talk to</text>
  <text start="192.959" dur="4.441">somewhere in the mid 40s to early 50s is</text>
  <text start="195.239" dur="3.601">typically the date range there but</text>
  <text start="197.4" dur="2.91">regardless of what you go with James or</text>
  <text start="198.84" dur="3.119">Galatians is the earliest book that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="3.54">really early and the only Christian</text>
  <text start="201.959" dur="3.331">writings we have from that time period</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="2.76">and so when you look at the first</text>
  <text start="205.29" dur="2.88">century there&amp;#39;s not a bunch of competing</text>
  <text start="206.61" dur="3.51">writings it&amp;#39;s just the books of the New</text>
  <text start="208.17" dur="3.12">Testament let me ask you about this</text>
  <text start="210.12" dur="2.82">question because this is one that has</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="5.09">come up in my discussions with other</text>
  <text start="212.94" dur="6.18">people of the earliest extant</text>
  <text start="216.38" dur="4.389">manuscripts there are differences there</text>
  <text start="219.12" dur="3.24">are clearly different than in the text I</text>
  <text start="220.769" dur="4.801">think a scholar like you would would be</text>
  <text start="222.36" dur="6.03">the first to admit that why why do those</text>
  <text start="225.57" dur="5.1">not bother you that&amp;#39;s a place that a lot</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="4.05">of skeptics like to go to if this is</text>
  <text start="230.67" dur="3.539">God&amp;#39;s Word well why didn&amp;#39;t God</text>
  <text start="232.44" dur="3.299">communicate it clearly why he</text>
  <text start="234.209" dur="2.791">communicated with differences in the</text>
  <text start="235.739" dur="2.851">earliest manuscript that&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="237" dur="2.64">question I get that question a lot fact</text>
  <text start="238.59" dur="2.19">a number of the different things I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="239.64" dur="2.49">written have been about textual</text>
  <text start="240.78" dur="3.51">criticism which has to do with the</text>
  <text start="242.13" dur="3.21">transmission of these documents there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.29" dur="2.94">lots of things about that that people</text>
  <text start="245.34" dur="3.39">need to know when I think it true so why</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="3.569">we can trust these documents but one of</text>
  <text start="248.73" dur="3.39">the major things to realize is that the</text>
  <text start="250.799" dur="2.671">New Testament is no different in any</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="3.69">other historical document becomes the</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="4.29">transmission in other words any document</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="4.47">if you want to transmit it over time has</text>
  <text start="257.76" dur="4.409">to be copied by hand by spots so whether</text>
  <text start="260.28" dur="3.36">you&amp;#39;re copying Plato or Aristotle or</text>
  <text start="262.169" dur="2.97">whether you&amp;#39;re copying Galatians</text>
  <text start="263.64" dur="2.88">everyone&amp;#39;s in the same boat</text>
  <text start="265.139" dur="3.75">and so the question then at that point</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="4.29">is if spawns make mistakes can we work</text>
  <text start="268.889" dur="3.09">our way back to what these with the</text>
  <text start="270.81" dur="3.419">scribe or what the original author</text>
  <text start="271.979" dur="4.081">actually said there&amp;#39;s lots of ways to do</text>
  <text start="274.229" dur="3.96">that one of the main ways we can do that</text>
  <text start="276.06" dur="4.47">is we have a lot of copies of that book</text>
  <text start="278.189" dur="3.66">the more copies we have the better and</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="2.55">so if you have a lot of copies that you</text>
  <text start="281.849" dur="2.671">can compare to one another the more</text>
  <text start="283.08" dur="3.149">assurance you can have that you can go</text>
  <text start="284.52" dur="2.97">back to the original source when it</text>
  <text start="286.229" dur="2.581">comes to new Testament we&amp;#39;re in a great</text>
  <text start="287.49" dur="2.579">position there we have more copies of</text>
  <text start="288.81" dur="3.15">New Testament writings than any other</text>
  <text start="290.069" dur="3.211">document in ancient history which is an</text>
  <text start="291.96" dur="3.6">amazing fact and one that we want to</text>
  <text start="293.28" dur="4.08">continually remind people on and the</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="4.56">other thing that I&amp;#39;ve heard scholars</text>
  <text start="297.36" dur="4.41">such as yourself say to reassure those</text>
  <text start="300.12" dur="3.84">of us who believe in the Bible is</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="5.239">authoritative is we know where the</text>
  <text start="303.96" dur="5.28">differences are and they are not</text>
  <text start="307.009" dur="4.541">significant when it comes to a general</text>
  <text start="309.24" dur="3.75">message of the gospel unrack that alone</text>
  <text start="311.55" dur="3.63">yeah well the key is that first phrase</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="3.929">we know where the differences are the</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="3.03">scary thing for us would be that there</text>
  <text start="316.919" dur="2.701">was a change in the text that we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="318.21" dur="3.239">know happens right and we think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="3.15">original one I really uh but this goes</text>
  <text start="321.449" dur="3.03">back to the number of manuscripts we</text>
  <text start="322.77" dur="3.329">have so many we can compare them and we</text>
  <text start="324.479" dur="3.271">can see where the changes are made and</text>
  <text start="326.099" dur="3.511">so the key is that we know that happen</text>
  <text start="327.75" dur="2.819">and if you can spot them when they</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="2.58">happen then you know they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="330.569" dur="2.91">original and once you know they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="332.19" dur="3.449">original then their importance fades</text>
  <text start="333.479" dur="3.451">away and so even if a scribe here made a</text>
  <text start="335.639" dur="2.49">big change or a scribe you&amp;#39;re made a</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="3.209">little change as long as we know they</text>
  <text start="338.129" dur="3.361">made the change then we know they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="340.139" dur="2.941">original and we can work our way back to</text>
  <text start="341.49" dur="3.75">the original text so that&amp;#39;s the major</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="3.329">issue there&amp;#39;s only two major changes to</text>
  <text start="345.24" dur="2.549">the text of the New Testament in the</text>
  <text start="346.409" dur="3.06">first place and that is the longing of</text>
  <text start="347.789" dur="3.81">Mark and the story of the adulterous</text>
  <text start="349.469" dur="4.23">woman in John 8 outside of that most of</text>
  <text start="351.599" dur="3.72">the changes are really small spelling</text>
  <text start="353.699" dur="4.08">errors and word order changes and things</text>
  <text start="355.319" dur="5.1">like this couple less things how does a</text>
  <text start="357.779" dur="5.19">scholar such as yourself view the</text>
  <text start="360.419" dur="4.381">mystery of Hebrews you know some people</text>
  <text start="362.969" dur="3.12">say how can we say that&amp;#39;s authoritative</text>
  <text start="364.8" dur="4.139">when we don&amp;#39;t even know who the author</text>
  <text start="366.089" dur="4.23">is yes that&amp;#39;s a great question I then</text>
  <text start="368.939" dur="2.82">people get hung up on Hebrews all the</text>
  <text start="370.319" dur="2.761">time a couple things to note about</text>
  <text start="371.759" dur="2.761">Hebrews even though we don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="373.08" dur="3.449">author for sure because it&amp;#39;s anonymous</text>
  <text start="374.52" dur="3.359">what&amp;#39;s interesting about the author of</text>
  <text start="376.529" dur="3.63">Hebrews even though he doesn&amp;#39;t tell us</text>
  <text start="377.879" dur="3.63">who he is he does tell us his source he</text>
  <text start="380.159" dur="2.94">tells us in Chapter two that he got his</text>
  <text start="381.509" dur="3.96">information directly from the Apostles</text>
  <text start="383.099" dur="3.99">this is a key fact it&amp;#39;s a lot like the</text>
  <text start="385.469" dur="3.12">Gospel of Luke in the sense Luke says</text>
  <text start="387.089" dur="3.121">yeah I&amp;#39;m not an apostle but I&amp;#39;m an</text>
  <text start="388.589" dur="3.721">apostolic man I mean I got my</text>
  <text start="390.21" dur="3.54">information from apostles and therefore</text>
  <text start="392.31" dur="1.72">the material I&amp;#39;m giving you is Apple</text>
  <text start="393.75" dur="1.96">Stahl</text>
  <text start="394.03" dur="3.15">material and so even though we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="395.71" dur="2.82">know the author of Hebrews we can be</text>
  <text start="397.18" dur="2.64">assured it&amp;#39;s Apple Stalin and if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="398.53" dur="3.24">apostolic and we have good confidence</text>
  <text start="399.82" dur="3.78">that it belongs in the candidate and I</text>
  <text start="401.77" dur="4.07">want to end it here you know our</text>
  <text start="403.6" dur="5.55">Catholic friends of course would say</text>
  <text start="405.84" dur="5.95">tradition and Scripture are on a par</text>
  <text start="409.15" dur="5.49">with one another another AG because we</text>
  <text start="411.79" dur="4.05">got Scripture as a result of tradition</text>
  <text start="414.64" dur="3.45">that&amp;#39;s what that is what they would say</text>
  <text start="415.84" dur="4.77">from the earls church church fathers how</text>
  <text start="418.09" dur="4.77">do you how do you answer that objection</text>
  <text start="420.61" dur="2.94">in a way this gracious store our cab yes</text>
  <text start="422.86" dur="3.48">absolutely</text>
  <text start="423.55" dur="4.68">well I appreciate their reminding us of</text>
  <text start="426.34" dur="3.45">the importance of the role to church in</text>
  <text start="428.23" dur="3.75">my recent book can it revisit it</text>
  <text start="429.79" dur="3.78">actually give the Church of a pretty big</text>
  <text start="431.98" dur="3.63">role in terms of how we know which books</text>
  <text start="433.57" dur="3.599">are canonical the key though is not</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="3.09">whether the church plays a role the key</text>
  <text start="437.169" dur="3.271">is doesn&amp;#39;t play the foundational role</text>
  <text start="438.7" dur="3.3">the Roman Catholics would say that it</text>
  <text start="440.44" dur="3.42">plays the foundational role out the</text>
  <text start="442" dur="3.39">church you cannot know Protestants we</text>
  <text start="443.86" dur="2.79">disagree we think there&amp;#39;s other ways to</text>
  <text start="445.39" dur="3.09">know which books are canonical the tonfa</text>

  <text start="628.93" dur="3.56">so this whole notion that somehow the</text>
  <text start="630.49" dur="4.47">Vatican and the Roman Catholic Church</text>
  <text start="632.49" dur="4.15">controlled the Canon is a bunch of</text>
  <text start="634.96" dur="3.81">nonsense and that&amp;#39;s proved historically</text>
  <text start="636.64" dur="4.02">and also think about it Paul even</text>
  <text start="638.77" dur="3.24">prophesized he prophesized in the New</text>
  <text start="640.66" dur="3.51">Testament says there&amp;#39;s going to come men</text>

  <text start="648.19" dur="3.42">that none of their priests can ever get</text>

  <text start="659.56" dur="4.2">really controlled the New Testament you</text>
  <text start="661.089" dur="4.021">think that allowed that in our Bible was</text>
  <text start="663.76" dur="3.18">I guess that slipped through the Vatican</text>
  <text start="665.11" dur="3.51">said see God&amp;#39;s more powerful than the</text>
  <text start="666.94" dur="3.21">Vatican that&amp;#39;s the whole point by the</text>
  <text start="668.62" dur="3.12">way the Council of Nicaea had nothing to</text>
  <text start="670.15" dur="4.02">do with establishing the canon by the</text>
  <text start="671.74" dur="4.47">way nothing counseled me see it was a</text>
  <text start="674.17" dur="6.12">completely different issue just want to</text>
  <text start="676.21" dur="6.42">put that out there now I want to read a</text>
  <text start="680.29" dur="3.989">comment this is from Pam Johnson she</text>
  <text start="682.63" dur="3.45">said I followed Mark Taylor beginning</text>
  <text start="684.279" dur="4.921">with his prophecies about Trump I read</text>
  <text start="686.08" dur="5.64">his book until recently and by the way I</text>
  <text start="689.2" dur="4.77">I of course acknowledge that Mark Taylor</text>
  <text start="691.72" dur="3.75">has given some true prophecies but</text>
  <text start="693.97" dur="4.08">remember there&amp;#39;s a warning in the book</text>
  <text start="695.47" dur="5.309">of the torez in the Torah and it says</text>
  <text start="698.05" dur="4.47">even if a prophet prophesized true and</text>
  <text start="700.779" dur="5.101">it comes to pass but he leads people</text>
  <text start="702.52" dur="4.83">away from God don&amp;#39;t believe him so just</text>
  <text start="705.88" dur="4.08">because Marcus had prophecies that have</text>
  <text start="707.35" dur="4.29">come to pass if he&amp;#39;s now saying well we</text>
  <text start="709.96" dur="3.06">can&amp;#39;t trust the Canon of Scripture we</text>
  <text start="711.64" dur="4.44">can&amp;#39;t we gotta have these new books</text>
  <text start="713.02" dur="6.24">guess what that means you have to say oh</text>
  <text start="716.08" dur="4.56">oh oh okay so here&amp;#39;s what Pam Johnson</text>
  <text start="719.26" dur="3.06">says she said I followed Mark Taylor</text>
  <text start="720.64" dur="4.38">beginning with us prophesies about Trump</text>
  <text start="722.32" dur="4.08">and his book until recently I&amp;#39;ve stopped</text>
  <text start="725.02" dur="3.42">following Mark Taylor for the very</text>
  <text start="726.4" dur="4.379">reason Daniel has made public he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="728.44" dur="3.81">promoting extra books of the Bible he</text>
  <text start="730.779" dur="3.541">might as well be promoting consulting</text>
  <text start="732.25" dur="4.709">the dead or palm reading and tarot cards</text>
  <text start="734.32" dur="4.44">Jesus called Peter a devil once remember</text>
  <text start="736.959" dur="4.201">why because he was wrong</text>
  <text start="738.76" dur="4.079">I agree with Daniel Mark Taylor needs to</text>
  <text start="741.16" dur="3.75">repent and stop promoting false</text>
  <text start="742.839" dur="4.171">teachings so-called lost books of the</text>
  <text start="744.91" dur="4.38">Bible disguised as God&amp;#39;s Word they are</text>
  <text start="747.01" dur="3.66">not God&amp;#39;s Word we already have God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="749.29" dur="2.94">Word which declares that the Word of God</text>
  <text start="750.67" dur="4.859">teaches us all we need to know about</text>
  <text start="752.23" dur="6.51">life and godliness 2nd Peter 1:3 why do</text>
  <text start="755.529" dur="6.031">we need more we don&amp;#39;t hallelujah Thank</text>
  <text start="758.74" dur="4.71">You Pam Johnson and then also people</text>
  <text start="761.56" dur="3.899">were saying well Daniel you keep quoting</text>
  <text start="763.45" dur="3.21">Revelation where it says don&amp;#39;t add or</text>
  <text start="765.459" dur="1.771">take away but that&amp;#39;s just the book of</text>
  <text start="766.66" dur="2.46">Revelation</text>
  <text start="767.23" dur="4.109">ok I&amp;#39;ll quote another scripture this is</text>
  <text start="769.12" dur="4.38">from Deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 2 it</text>
  <text start="771.339" dur="4.261">says you shall not add unto the word</text>
  <text start="773.5" dur="3.959">which I command you neither shall ye</text>
  <text start="775.6" dur="4.29">diminish off from it that you may keep</text>
  <text start="777.459" dur="6.241">the commandments of the Lord your God</text>
  <text start="779.89" dur="7.11">which I command you when we start saying</text>
  <text start="783.7" dur="7.01">like Mark Taylor said that somehow we</text>
  <text start="787" dur="5.48">can alter we can you find the</text>
  <text start="790.71" dur="3">extra lost books that have been hidden</text>
  <text start="792.48" dur="4.5">away and that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s saying by the</text>
  <text start="793.71" dur="5.43">way he&amp;#39;s saying that the NSA has</text>
  <text start="796.98" dur="5.16">discovery go listen to the interview</text>
  <text start="799.14" dur="4.56">yourself it&amp;#39;s on blessed to teach this</text>
  <text start="802.14" dur="4.53">is most recent interview on blessed to</text>
  <text start="803.7" dur="4.68">teach but the NSA has finally figure out</text>
  <text start="806.67" dur="4.38">all these lost writings that weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="808.38" dur="4.079">part of the original scriptures in fact</text>
  <text start="811.05" dur="3.599">let me let me just point out something</text>
  <text start="812.459" dur="4.141">Mark Taylor says in his own words he</text>
  <text start="814.649" dur="4.411">says he quotes the scripture and John</text>
  <text start="816.6" dur="4.799">where it talks about how let me just</text>
  <text start="819.06" dur="4.08">read it here I just want to give an</text>
  <text start="821.399" dur="5.161">example of how Mark is being so careless</text>
  <text start="823.14" dur="5.639">with the Word of God he says okay in the</text>
  <text start="826.56" dur="5.04">last chapter of John last verse of of</text>
  <text start="828.779" dur="4.471">the book of John the Gospel of John it</text>
  <text start="831.6" dur="3.63">says and there are also many other</text>
  <text start="833.25" dur="3.66">things which Jesus did the which if they</text>
  <text start="835.23" dur="3.12">should be written every one I suppose</text>
  <text start="836.91" dur="2.549">that even the world itself could not</text>
  <text start="838.35" dur="3.9">contain the books that should be written</text>
  <text start="839.459" dur="6.481">now Mark Taylor says and I show this mic</text>
  <text start="842.25" dur="6.209">in my video from last night he says look</text>
  <text start="845.94" dur="3.69">look there&amp;#39;s it says if they should be</text>
  <text start="848.459" dur="2.521">written every one I suppose that even</text>
  <text start="849.63" dur="4.2">the world itself could not contain the</text>
  <text start="850.98" dur="4.5">books so those miracles of Jesus must be</text>
  <text start="853.83" dur="3.66">written down somewhere no Marcus not</text>
  <text start="855.48" dur="3.9">what the scripture says it says if they</text>
  <text start="857.49" dur="3.27">should be written every one I suppose</text>
  <text start="859.38" dur="2.43">that even the rule itself could not</text>
  <text start="860.76" dur="2.97">contain the books that should be written</text>
  <text start="861.81" dur="4.44">in other words it&amp;#39;s saying they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="863.73" dur="4.71">written down so see how Mark takes the</text>
  <text start="866.25" dur="5.279">scripture and completely flips it on its</text>
  <text start="868.44" dur="4.35">head it&amp;#39;s nonsense it&amp;#39;s craziness people</text>
  <text start="871.529" dur="3.06">are saying well Daniel why are you</text>
  <text start="872.79" dur="4.2">attacking Mark Taylor because Mark</text>
  <text start="874.589" dur="4.141">Taylor is misleading the flock this is</text>
  <text start="876.99" dur="3.66">vitally important folks we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="878.73" dur="4.59">about the sanctity of the word of God</text>
  <text start="880.65" dur="5.37">there is absolutely no reason to doubt</text>
  <text start="883.32" dur="5.1">this the way this Canon was formed</text>
  <text start="886.02" dur="5.1">because God was in control just like he</text>
  <text start="888.42" dur="5.58">says he says all through this book he</text>
  <text start="891.12" dur="5.07">says I preserve my word he says it</text>
  <text start="894" dur="6">plainly I preserve my word well if there</text>
  <text start="896.19" dur="6.149">are hidden scrolls and hidden books that</text>
  <text start="900" dur="4.38">will somehow a in giving us a greater</text>
  <text start="902.339" dur="3.931">understanding or clarity or whatnot</text>
  <text start="904.38" dur="4.17">whatever it&amp;#39;s just a bunch of nonsense</text>
  <text start="906.27" dur="4.439">might you listen to what Mark says go</text>
  <text start="908.55" dur="5.099">listen to the whole thing and you tell</text>
  <text start="910.709" dur="6.181">me he is speaking from a demon from a</text>
  <text start="913.649" dur="5.071">devil I cannot believe how many of my</text>
  <text start="916.89" dur="3.569">subscribers are fooled and deceived by</text>
  <text start="918.72" dur="3.6">this and you think I&amp;#39;m wrong for getting</text>
  <text start="920.459" dur="2.36">passionate about this you know that</text>

  <text start="937.399" dur="3.66">the traditions of men somehow saying</text>
  <text start="939.259" dur="4.05">that that Gentiles who wanted to become</text>

  <text start="945.769" dur="3.81">nothing in Torah that says that in fact</text>
  <text start="947.119" dur="3.99">Torah says Gentiles can come in and</text>
  <text start="949.579" dur="3.66">become part of Israel just like</text>
