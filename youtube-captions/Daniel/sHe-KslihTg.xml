  <text start="37.2" dur="3.12">to try to explain to the Christian</text>
  <text start="38.61" dur="3.03">Church its first of all you don&amp;#39;t learn</text>
  <text start="40.32" dur="3.54">all these rules at once you learn them</text>
  <text start="41.64" dur="4.97">one at a time it&amp;#39;s an exciting adventure</text>
  <text start="43.86" dur="6.03">of learning one after another bit by bit</text>
  <text start="46.61" dur="6.67">but second of all these Commandments in</text>
  <text start="49.89" dur="6">the Torah they are a blessing they are a</text>
  <text start="53.28" dur="4.98">blessing they protect you they bring you</text>
  <text start="55.89" dur="6.54">closer to Messiah they&amp;#39;re not a burden</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="6.03">and I know that a lot of pastors have</text>
  <text start="62.43" dur="4.049">said well this is just for the Jews it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="64.29" dur="4.619">just old testament but the thing is when</text>
  <text start="66.479" dur="4.441">you start obeying these Commandments in</text>
  <text start="68.909" dur="4.051">the Torah like just one example the</text>
  <text start="70.92" dur="5.129">Sabbath day you know when you set aside</text>
  <text start="72.96" dur="6.15">the seventh day of the week to rest and</text>
  <text start="76.049" dur="5.131">spend extra time with him it blesses you</text>
  <text start="79.11" dur="5.009">not only does it give you an incredibly</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="4.53">rejuvenating rest but then you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="84.119" dur="4.171">so much more productive during the six</text>
  <text start="85.71" dur="4.14">days of the workweek and that&amp;#39;s just one</text>
  <text start="88.29" dur="3.75">example so I want to just do this</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="4.769">teaching I try to explain this a little</text>
  <text start="92.04" dur="6.149">bit more and hopefully it&amp;#39;ll it&amp;#39;ll make</text>
  <text start="94.619" dur="6.86">it more clear in Deuteronomy Deuteronomy</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="5.64">chapter 31 is where we&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="101.479" dur="6.701">and we&amp;#39;re going to just highlight verses</text>
  <text start="103.829" dur="6.33">25 and 26 now Deuteronomy Moses what he</text>
  <text start="108.18" dur="4.86">does is he goes through all the Torah</text>
  <text start="110.159" dur="4.831">again all the commandments and statutes</text>
  <text start="113.04" dur="4.079">and judgments that were delivered up</text>
  <text start="114.99" dur="4.08">until this point he he reiterates it</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="2.941">through the book of Deuteronomy and so</text>
  <text start="119.07" dur="4.049">now that we get into the interview</text>
  <text start="120.06" dur="5.489">Terron me it literally says that Moses</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="3.511">commanded the Levites which bear the Ark</text>
  <text start="125.549" dur="3.031">of the Covenant</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="3.349">remember they had the Ark which was born</text>
  <text start="128.58" dur="3.079">by the Levites and it would get</text>
  <text start="129.979" dur="3.271">when they would pitch the tabernacle</text>
  <text start="131.659" dur="3.541">wherever they would camp as they were</text>
  <text start="133.25" dur="4.08">journeying through the wilderness to the</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="4.44">promised land the Ark of the Covenant</text>
  <text start="137.33" dur="3.93">was placed in the most holy place and</text>
  <text start="139.64" dur="3.42">this is where the presence of yah would</text>
  <text start="141.26" dur="3.539">dwell is in this Ark of the Covenant</text>
  <text start="143.06" dur="4.17">with the two angels that would be</text>
  <text start="144.799" dur="4.591">looking down inward and then the</text>
  <text start="147.23" dur="4.83">presence of Yahoo literally be right</text>
  <text start="149.39" dur="5.01">here above the Ark and so the Ark of his</text>
  <text start="152.06" dur="4.13">covenant was the Ark of his presence</text>
  <text start="154.4" dur="5.309">that&amp;#39;s where was very presence dwell and</text>
  <text start="156.19" dur="6.1">if it says I want you to take the book</text>
  <text start="159.709" dur="4.14">of the Torah the law and all the</text>
  <text start="162.29" dur="3.839">statutes and judgments of Commandments</text>
  <text start="163.849" dur="4.2">and put it in the side of the Ark so</text>
  <text start="166.129" dur="3.241">they would put this the book with all</text>
  <text start="168.049" dur="3.72">these instructions that have been given</text>
  <text start="169.37" dur="4.589">and they put it right there on the side</text>
  <text start="171.769" dur="4.47">of the ark of the covenant of yahweh</text>
  <text start="173.959" dur="4.14">your your Elohim then it may be</text>
  <text start="176.239" dur="4.381">therefore a witness against you so they</text>
  <text start="178.099" dur="4.23">would put this Torah all these</text>
  <text start="180.62" dur="4.8">instructions right in the Ark where his</text>
  <text start="182.329" dur="4.291">presence would be and of course there</text>
  <text start="185.42" dur="3.149">were other things in there too they put</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="3.479">some manna in there as a memorial</text>
  <text start="188.569" dur="4.2">how y&amp;#39;all fit them through the</text>
  <text start="190.099" dur="4.5">wilderness and the rod of Aramis but it</text>
  <text start="192.769" dur="6.06">would show that the Levites have been</text>
  <text start="194.599" dur="6.51">chosen to be the priests so the Torah is</text>
  <text start="198.829" dur="7.011">in this art where Yas presence would be</text>
  <text start="201.109" dur="4.731">and now if we skip ahead unto Jeremiah</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="12.43">31:31 and we&amp;#39;re gonna go through 33 and</text>
  <text start="217.04" dur="5.97">it says behold the days come saith</text>
  <text start="219.38" dur="5.82">Yahweh that I will make a new covenant a</text>
  <text start="223.01" dur="3.93">new covenant with the house of Israel</text>
  <text start="225.2" dur="3.06">with the house of Judah not according to</text>
  <text start="226.94" dur="3.87">the Covenant that I made with their</text>
  <text start="228.26" dur="4.11">fathers in the day that I took them by</text>
  <text start="230.81" dur="3.53">the hand to bring them out of the land</text>
  <text start="232.37" dur="4.11">of Egypt which my covenant they break</text>
  <text start="234.34" dur="3.759">although I was a husband unto them</text>
  <text start="236.48" dur="3.27">saying yo Eve but this shall be the</text>
  <text start="238.099" dur="3.811">Covenant that I will make with the house</text>
  <text start="239.75" dur="5.34">of Israel after those days saith Yahweh</text>
  <text start="241.91" dur="6.03">I will put my law my Torah my statutes</text>
  <text start="245.09" dur="5.579">in their inward parts and write it in</text>
  <text start="247.94" dur="4.169">the hearts and will be their yah and</text>
  <text start="250.669" dur="4.231">they shall be my people so this was</text>
  <text start="252.109" dur="6.11">Jeremiah right here prophesying about</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="5.73">this new covenant this renewed covenant</text>
  <text start="258.219" dur="4.67">and it had not yet come to be but he</text>
  <text start="260.63" dur="4.599">said that all these laws and staff</text>
  <text start="262.889" dur="3.721">and you know Jeremiah he was talking</text>
  <text start="265.229" dur="2.641">about these laws and statutes he was</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="3.51">talk about the Torah that&amp;#39;s all that had</text>
  <text start="267.87" dur="4.049">been written at that point and he said</text>
  <text start="270.12" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s going to be put in there in Word in</text>
  <text start="271.919" dur="4.65">inward parts right inside their hearts</text>
  <text start="273.96" dur="3.84">and in their minds deep inside and we</text>
  <text start="276.569" dur="4.47">get to see how this is just so</text>
  <text start="277.8" dur="6.209">intimately connected to yah commanding</text>
  <text start="281.039" dur="5.16">through Moses that that they put the</text>
  <text start="284.009" dur="6.06">book of the law look for it right inside</text>
  <text start="286.199" dur="7.65">the Ark where his presence was now</text>
  <text start="290.069" dur="6.06">Jeremiah 31 31 through 33 as he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.849" dur="6.421">prophesying about this it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="296.129" dur="9.6">then repeated and where it starts to</text>
  <text start="300.27" dur="11.009">find its fulfillment in Hebrews 8 and</text>
  <text start="305.729" dur="8.4">we&amp;#39;re gonna go right to Hebrews 8 where</text>
  <text start="311.279" dur="6.241">he basically just quotes it so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="314.129" dur="8.28">gonna start in in verse 8 and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="317.52" dur="7.829">going to go through verse 10 and it says</text>
  <text start="322.409" dur="5.641">for finding fault with them remember</text>
  <text start="325.349" dur="5.16">because they the people in the</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="5.729">wilderness didn&amp;#39;t mix their faith with</text>
  <text start="330.509" dur="5.28">the Torah for finding fault with them he</text>
  <text start="333.779" dur="4.29">says behold the days come saith Yahweh</text>
  <text start="335.789" dur="4.021">when I will make a new covenant with the</text>
  <text start="338.069" dur="4.171">house of Israel and with the house of</text>
  <text start="339.81" dur="3.87">Judah not according to the Covenant that</text>
  <text start="342.24" dur="3">I made with their fathers in the day</text>
  <text start="343.68" dur="3.75">that I took them by the hand to lead</text>
  <text start="345.24" dur="4.979">them out for the land of egypt because</text>
  <text start="347.43" dur="5.4">they continued not in my covenant and i</text>
  <text start="350.219" dur="4.051">regarded them not saith yahweh for this</text>
  <text start="352.83" dur="3.059">is the covenant that i will make with</text>
  <text start="354.27" dur="5.16">the house of israel after those days</text>
  <text start="355.889" dur="5.821">saith yahweh i will put my laws into</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="4.799">their mind and write them in their</text>
  <text start="361.71" dur="6.959">hearts and i will be to the may yah and</text>
  <text start="364.229" dur="7.59">they shall be to me a people so again we</text>
  <text start="368.669" dur="6.391">have the the laws the Torah the commands</text>
  <text start="371.819" dur="5.31">the statutes which Moses was commanded</text>
  <text start="375.06" dur="4.949">the people to put this in the Ark of his</text>
  <text start="377.129" dur="4.621">presence which Jeremiah then prophesied</text>
  <text start="380.009" dur="5.761">of and now it&amp;#39;s finally being fulfilled</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="7.8">here and so now we have in our hearts</text>
  <text start="385.77" dur="5.67">and our minds we have this book of the</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="2.87">Torah this law these Commandments as</text>
  <text start="391.44" dur="5.27">statutes put</text>
  <text start="392.42" dur="5.58">into us by his finger when we get</text>
  <text start="396.71" dur="3.03">cleansing his blood and filled the</text>
  <text start="398" dur="6.18">spirit this is what the new covenants</text>
  <text start="399.74" dur="9.18">all about he makes it with Israel still</text>
  <text start="404.18" dur="8.13">is still Israel still Israel Israel will</text>
  <text start="408.92" dur="5.82">always be they are and always will be</text>
  <text start="412.31" dur="3.96">those who are covered in his blood and</text>
  <text start="414.74" dur="4.02">filled the spirit they were like that</text>
  <text start="416.27" dur="4.53">back here and in the days of Jeremiah</text>
  <text start="418.76" dur="5.16">and and in the days after the Messiah</text>
  <text start="420.8" dur="8.91">died and rose again it&amp;#39;s always been the</text>
  <text start="423.92" dur="7.89">same Israel so we are we are his ark</text>
  <text start="429.71" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;re the ark where he wants to dwell</text>
  <text start="431.81" dur="5.07">within us we are the Ark of his presence</text>
  <text start="433.7" dur="5.97">now and he still wants to put his laws</text>
  <text start="436.88" dur="5.76">and his statutes in to our hearts and</text>
  <text start="439.67" dur="5.1">our minds just like he said put this</text>
  <text start="442.64" dur="4.13">book of the tour of the statutes right</text>
  <text start="444.77" dur="6.3">into the ark where his presence would be</text>
  <text start="446.77" dur="5.92">and just as Jeremiah prophesied and said</text>
  <text start="451.07" dur="3.96">I&amp;#39;m going to put it in their inward</text>
  <text start="452.69" dur="4.92">parts I&amp;#39;m gonna put these laws these</text>
  <text start="455.03" dur="6.6">statutes into their inward being and</text>
  <text start="457.61" dur="6.03">just as Hebrews then reaffirms and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="461.63" dur="3.36">gonna write my laws my statutes my</text>
  <text start="463.64" dur="2.85">commandments on their hearts and on</text>
  <text start="464.99" dur="4.04">their minds and they will be to me a</text>
  <text start="466.49" dur="5.07">people and I will be to them a yacht</text>
  <text start="469.03" dur="4.63">because when when Moses was commanded to</text>
  <text start="471.56" dur="5.19">put this book of the law into the side</text>
  <text start="473.66" dur="4.68">of the Ark this is what yah was trying</text>
  <text start="476.75" dur="3.81">to communicate to his people even back</text>
  <text start="478.34" dur="3.87">then saying I want I don&amp;#39;t want these</text>
  <text start="480.56" dur="4.11">laws these statutes just written on</text>
  <text start="482.21" dur="4.59">tablets of stone or on pieces of</text>
  <text start="484.67" dur="3.6">parchment I want them embedded in your</text>
  <text start="486.8" dur="4.14">heart and in your mind I want you to</text>
  <text start="488.27" dur="5.46">have this inward desire to want to serve</text>
  <text start="490.94" dur="4.38">me to want to love me to want to keep</text>
  <text start="493.73" dur="5.49">these Commandments and this is the</text>
  <text start="495.32" dur="9.69">essence of what the New Covenant is all</text>
  <text start="499.22" dur="8.25">about the people fail and when you have</text>
  <text start="505.01" dur="4.59">two parties of a entering into a</text>
  <text start="507.47" dur="3.75">contract if one of the parties fails</text>
  <text start="509.6" dur="5.58">that contract gets rendered null and</text>
  <text start="511.22" dur="6.06">void and it says what did he find a</text>
  <text start="515.18" dur="3.87">fault woman what it wasn&amp;#39;t this Torah</text>
  <text start="517.28" dur="2.35">it wasn&amp;#39;t the Ark of his presence it was</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="3.04">the eye</text>
  <text start="519.63" dur="5.25">the people that failed that&amp;#39;s what was</text>
  <text start="522.09" dur="7.2">problem so so here we have a new</text>
  <text start="524.88" dur="5.61">covenant a new covenant and we still got</text>
  <text start="529.29" dur="2.97">his for his commandments his</text>
  <text start="530.49" dur="4.41">instructions he still wants to put it</text>
  <text start="532.26" dur="5.07">inside us but now we&amp;#39;re entering into</text>
  <text start="534.9" dur="4.62">another contract because we failed the</text>
  <text start="537.33" dur="2.88">first one whoops we failed the first</text>
  <text start="539.52" dur="7.38">contract</text>
  <text start="540.21" dur="8.49">don&amp;#39;t you anymore and so now he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="546.9" dur="4.35">make sure that we keep this contract</text>
  <text start="548.7" dur="5.49">because the whole point of Yahshua dying</text>
  <text start="551.25" dur="6.78">on the stake on the tree when he was</text>
  <text start="554.19" dur="4.92">murdered on Passover 2,000 years ago the</text>
  <text start="558.03" dur="2.91">whole point of his shedding his blood</text>
  <text start="559.11" dur="3.99">and going for that gruesome death it</text>
  <text start="560.94" dur="5.67">should break our heart so much when we</text>
  <text start="563.1" dur="5.76">see what our sin did to him that it</text>
  <text start="566.61" dur="4.08">causes a sorrow this great sorrow that</text>
  <text start="568.86" dur="3.48">that works for penton&amp;#39;s not the sorrow</text>
  <text start="570.69" dur="3.15">of the world at least death at the saw a</text>
  <text start="572.34" dur="5.19">godly sorrow that leads to repentance</text>
  <text start="573.84" dur="5.64">and then when the blood washes us that</text>
  <text start="577.53" dur="4.17">weren&amp;#39;t past transgressions against his</text>
  <text start="579.48" dur="4.23">command sistera then he fills us with</text>
  <text start="581.7" dur="4.02">his spirit his holy spirit his holy</text>
  <text start="583.71" dur="3.57">spirit which enables us to then start</text>
  <text start="585.72" dur="3.54">walking in his statutes and his</text>
  <text start="587.28" dur="4.08">commandments and his judgments and again</text>
  <text start="589.26" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s a continual process it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="591.36" dur="4.44">sanctification that we continue to learn</text>
  <text start="593.31" dur="4.5">oh here&amp;#39;s a here&amp;#39;s the commandment let</text>
  <text start="595.8" dur="4.5">me obey this and oh my goodness as I</text>
  <text start="597.81" dur="3.93">start obeying it its blessing my life so</text>
  <text start="600.3" dur="6.51">much it&amp;#39;s bringing me so much closer to</text>
  <text start="601.74" dur="7.77">him there&amp;#39;s a lot of sicknesses and</text>
