  <text start="392.84" dur="7.32">so tell me where is in your opinion is</text>
  <text start="396.65" dur="5.85">Elle I&amp;#39;ve always thought it was in the</text>
  <text start="400.16" dur="5.1">sinner tier and I answer that just one</text>
  <text start="402.5" dur="4.23">moment okay here guys we are at the end</text>
  <text start="405.26" dur="6.78">of the road and John if you can just</text>
  <text start="406.73" dur="6.99">show the end sign it says literally on</text>
  <text start="412.04" dur="3.36">the road guys we are at the southern you</text>
  <text start="413.72" dur="3.51">cannot go any farther south unless you</text>
  <text start="415.4" dur="5.58">go on this guy&amp;#39;s private property here</text>
  <text start="417.23" dur="5.1">you cannot go any further south if you</text>
  <text start="420.98" dur="3.27">want to go farther south and get to</text>
  <text start="422.33" dur="3.42">British Columbia or Washington Oregon</text>
  <text start="424.25" dur="4.169">you got to hop on a plane or a boat from</text>
  <text start="425.75" dur="4.62">here not only push this you just let it</text>
  <text start="428.419" dur="4.231">keep recording but they&amp;#39;re tired of</text>
  <text start="430.37" dur="3.66">holding an exit I want to test it out to</text>
  <text start="432.65" dur="6.54">see how much we can record</text>
  <text start="434.03" dur="7.02">okay so he&amp;#39;ll so my belief is that no</text>
  <text start="439.19" dur="4.47">one is in Hell right now and no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="441.05" dur="4.26">inhibited my belief is that you fall</text>
  <text start="443.66" dur="6.45">asleep in Christ or you fall asleep in</text>
  <text start="445.31" dur="6.06">your sin and at the resurrection when we</text>
  <text start="450.11" dur="3.36">get resurrected that&amp;#39;s when we go to</text>
  <text start="451.37" dur="3.09">heaven to be with Jesus and then of</text>
  <text start="453.47" dur="2.19">course we return to Earth and I</text>
  <text start="454.46" dur="2.73">resurrect the bodies to rule with him</text>
  <text start="455.66" dur="2.99">and then as for the hell people they</text>
  <text start="457.19" dur="3.53">don&amp;#39;t get resurrected until after the</text>
  <text start="458.65" dur="4.15">Millennial Kingdom at the second death</text>
  <text start="460.72" dur="3.52">their resurrected all the wicked people</text>
  <text start="462.8" dur="2.44">are resurrected with brand new bodies</text>
  <text start="464.24" dur="3">from their sleep</text>
  <text start="465.24" dur="4.28">[Music]</text>
  <text start="467.24" dur="3.63">all the wicked people at the great white</text>
  <text start="469.52" dur="3.72">throne judgment and then they are thrown</text>
  <text start="470.87" dur="4.829">to the lake of fire the lake of fire</text>
  <text start="473.24" dur="4.649">is what we call Hell the lake of fire is</text>
  <text start="475.699" dur="3.631">where every wicked person along with the</text>
  <text start="477.889" dur="3.601">devil knows angels will be tormented</text>
  <text start="479.33" dur="4.02">from age to age forever and forever and</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="3.929">I believe the lake of fire probably</text>
  <text start="483.35" dur="3.96">similar to like what our Sun is and</text>
  <text start="485.419" dur="3.691">because the wicked people are gonna have</text>
  <text start="487.31" dur="3.24">resurrected perfect bodies like us</text>
  <text start="489.11" dur="3.809">that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re gonna be tortured</text>
  <text start="490.55" dur="3.839">forever because their bodies won&amp;#39;t die</text>
  <text start="492.919" dur="3.571">because they have these new bodies but</text>
  <text start="494.389" dur="4.081">they&amp;#39;re gonna be in a place where those</text>
  <text start="496.49" dur="6.36">new bodies are gonna be an extreme</text>
  <text start="498.47" dur="6.33">suffering so the whole idea of people in</text>
  <text start="502.85" dur="3.12">Heaven and Hell right now now I should</text>
  <text start="504.8" dur="2.839">take that back there are some people in</text>
  <text start="505.97" dur="3.81">heaven right now there&amp;#39;s the 24 elders</text>
  <text start="507.639" dur="4.871">which were people that were resurrected</text>
  <text start="509.78" dur="3.9">when Jesus remember when Jesus died and</text>
  <text start="512.51" dur="3.12">there&amp;#39;s a great earthquake and it says</text>
  <text start="513.68" dur="3.9">graves certain people rose from their</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="3.659">graves so there was a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="517.58" dur="3.24">resurrection at that point the people</text>
  <text start="519.289" dur="3.361">said they even saw people walking around</text>
  <text start="520.82" dur="3.84">that had died</text>
  <text start="522.65" dur="2.97">those may be the 24 elders that are up</text>
  <text start="524.66" dur="3.03">in heaven right now</text>
  <text start="525.62" dur="3.27">but in terms of this notion of people</text>
  <text start="527.69" dur="2.85">being in heaven and hell&amp;#39; right now</text>
  <text start="528.89" dur="2.91">that&amp;#39;s from greek mythology that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="530.54" dur="3.81">really what the hebrew scriptures teach</text>
  <text start="531.8" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s why all of the New Testament like</text>
  <text start="534.35" dur="5.28">for instance when Steven dies that says</text>
  <text start="535.85" dur="6.81">he fell asleep in Christ so I believe</text>
  <text start="539.63" dur="5.97">the resurrection has not heard yet so</text>
  <text start="542.66" dur="7.5">you believe people like Mary Kay Baxter</text>
  <text start="545.6" dur="7.89">and this guy that went to hell for 24</text>
  <text start="550.16" dur="4.83">minutes well think about it when not</text>
  <text start="553.49" dur="2.85">necess I don&amp;#39;t necessarily disbelieve</text>
  <text start="554.99" dur="3.09">them because think about it if you die</text>
  <text start="556.34" dur="4.86">what&amp;#39;s the very next thing you&amp;#39;re aware</text>
  <text start="558.08" dur="4.5">of the bring it&amp;#39;s like time travel the</text>
  <text start="561.2" dur="2.97">very next thing you&amp;#39;re aware of is when</text>
  <text start="562.58" dur="3.87">you get resurrected and meet Jesus in</text>
  <text start="564.17" dur="4.56">the clouds and go to heaven or if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="566.45" dur="3.75">a sinner if you die the very next thing</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="3.78">you&amp;#39;re aware of is what happens after</text>
  <text start="570.2" dur="3.75">the thousand years we&amp;#39;re resurrected for</text>
  <text start="572.51" dur="3.54">the great white throne judgment and your</text>
  <text start="573.95" dur="4.98">caste and lake of fire so for anyone who</text>
  <text start="576.05" dur="4.89">dies it&amp;#39;s instantaneous because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="578.93" dur="3.09">not aware of how long they&amp;#39;re sleeping</text>
  <text start="580.94" dur="3.84">right just like when you go to sleep</text>
  <text start="582.02" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;re not really aware so Mary Baxter</text>

  <text start="1778.32" dur="3.57">actually they do the third of July and</text>
  <text start="1780.09" dur="3.12">the reason they do the third of July is</text>
  <text start="1781.89" dur="2.82">because when the miners used to work</text>
  <text start="1783.21" dur="3.66">here their shift with start at midnight</text>
  <text start="1784.71" dur="3.72">so they couldn&amp;#39;t do fireworks on 4th of</text>
  <text start="1786.87" dur="2.28">July like every other Americans do</text>
  <text start="1788.43" dur="2.91">because they had to be at work at</text>
  <text start="1789.15" dur="3.96">midnight right so instead we celebrate</text>
  <text start="1791.34" dur="5.04">the night of the 3rd of July going into</text>
  <text start="1793.11" dur="4.74">the 4th of July and they just stuck with</text>

  <text start="1797.85" dur="5.49">at the mine here and just that that</text>
  <text start="1800.64" dur="5.43">stuck and so we celebrate on the night</text>

  <text start="2465.109" dur="3.45">you know I had a friend who had a vision</text>
  <text start="2467.209" dur="2.82">of what it&amp;#39;s gonna be like right before</text>
  <text start="2468.559" dur="3.6">the Great Tribulation begins</text>
  <text start="2470.029" dur="4.56">he says technology is gonna be so far</text>
  <text start="2472.159" dur="4.05">advanced by the time we get to the Great</text>
  <text start="2474.589" dur="2.76">Tribulation that literally with the</text>

  <text start="2477.349" dur="3.42">whatever you want this is why I love you</text>
  <text start="2478.819" dur="4.901">we&amp;#39;re going to depart from y&amp;#39;all because</text>
  <text start="2480.769" dur="4.961">life is gonna be so easy</text>
  <text start="2483.72" dur="3.42">way easier than it is now but we think</text>
  <text start="2485.73" dur="2.97">we have technology now it&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="2487.14" dur="4.59">compared to what&amp;#39;s going to be like if</text>
  <text start="2488.7" dur="4.379">you take the mark of the beach well even</text>
  <text start="2491.73" dur="2.49">before you get to that point I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="2493.079" dur="5.01">you&amp;#39;re gonna have an explosion of</text>
  <text start="2494.22" dur="5.52">Technology we&amp;#39;re there already they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2498.089" dur="3.301">giving you the mark of the beast until</text>
  <text start="2499.74" dur="5.99">they&amp;#39;re putting it in your hand well</text>
  <text start="2501.39" dur="4.34">yeah that&amp;#39;s just very limited and on</text>
  <text start="2505.95" dur="4.84">very few people taking it hasn&amp;#39;t become</text>
  <text start="2508.69" dur="4.2">a worldwide thing it&amp;#39;s gonna become a</text>
  <text start="2510.79" dur="4.08">worldwide thing but I&amp;#39;m saying before we</text>
  <text start="2512.89" dur="4.23">get to that point</text>
  <text start="2514.87" dur="4.38">before we get to that point</text>
  <text start="2517.12" dur="5.49">you&amp;#39;re gonna see way more technology I</text>
  <text start="2519.25" dur="4.5">believe between now because my opinion</text>
  <text start="2522.61" dur="3.9">is is that the Great Tribulation begins</text>
  <text start="2523.75" dur="4.23">in early 2024 I believe between now and</text>
  <text start="2526.51" dur="4.32">2020 for you&amp;#39;re gonna have such an</text>
  <text start="2527.98" dur="4.47">explosion of technology that this world</text>
  <text start="2530.83" dur="4.56">is going to be unrecognizable from what</text>
  <text start="2532.45" dur="5.99">looks like right now that&amp;#39;s what I think</text>
  <text start="2535.39" dur="3.05">now I could be wrong</text>
  <text start="2540.74" dur="5.369">but yeah then you&amp;#39;re right once the once</text>
  <text start="2543.05" dur="4.89">the Great Tribulation begins only those</text>
  <text start="2546.109" dur="3.661">who take the marvel to continue with the</text>
  <text start="2547.94" dur="4.62">ease of that technology</text>
  <text start="2549.77" dur="3.46">John about the airport children you know</text>
  <text start="2552.56" dur="2.5">years</text>
  <text start="2553.23" dur="4.25">eating these microchips put in them so</text>
  <text start="2555.06" dur="4.91">they were they got lost they could find</text>

  <text start="2576.29" dur="3.33">some prototypes now but what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2577.79" dur="3.93">eventually going to be when they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2579.62" dur="4.17">really got the technology perfected if</text>
  <text start="2581.72" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s gonna be nanobots at a biological</text>
  <text start="2583.79" dur="4.44">level in a serum that they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
