  <text start="11.16" dur="22.52">the years so he revised in Zephaniah he</text>
  <text start="22.199" dur="14.821">is the gatherer of his people Israel and</text>

  <text start="40.26" dur="4.95">back to the land and this concept of</text>
  <text start="43.8" dur="3.3">course is altered structure and you see</text>
  <text start="45.21" dur="3.06">it in Ezekiel we see it in the Gospels</text>
  <text start="47.1" dur="2.85">we see it in many other places but</text>
  <text start="48.27" dur="3.9">zephaniah is almost primarily concerned</text>

  <text start="77.7" dur="4.739">directly from Haggai two verses 11</text>
  <text start="80.64" dur="3.81">through 14 but the theme of this book</text>
  <text start="82.439" dur="4.891">short look is about how we need to look</text>
  <text start="84.45" dur="4.23">hold you to live with a pure heart we</text>
  <text start="87.33" dur="3.24">need to be seeking after him with</text>

  <text start="90.57" dur="5.549">requires that&amp;#39;s what he wants a recipe</text>
  <text start="92.549" dur="9.541">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what should characterizes</text>
  <text start="96.119" dur="9.981">people is purity in Zechariah is one of</text>
  <text start="102.09" dur="9.29">my favorite books and one of my berries</text>

  <text start="111.38" dur="6.61">Jerusalem are you brush line causing all</text>
  <text start="116.159" dur="5.151">nations to come up for the Hebrew feasts</text>
  <text start="117.99" dur="6.19">of course we read in the last chapter</text>
  <text start="121.31" dur="6.03">14 Zechariah how one day in the future</text>
  <text start="124.18" dur="7.029">Messiah will rule and reign from</text>

  <text start="131.209" dur="2.671">earth will be required to come up for</text>
  <text start="132.349" dur="3.871">the feast of Sukkot and if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="133.88" dur="5.579">come up then they will receive payment</text>
  <text start="136.22" dur="7.019">ah so Zechariah total tells us what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="139.459" dur="7.261">going to be like now we come to the last</text>
  <text start="143.239" dur="8.78">book of the so-called Old Testament and</text>
  <text start="146.72" dur="9.66">that is Malachi and Malachi is the Sun</text>
  <text start="152.019" dur="13.561">infectious process um son of righteous</text>
  <text start="156.38" dur="11.9">ah and he has healing in his wings and</text>
  <text start="165.58" dur="5.67">that healing in his wings is a direct</text>
  <text start="168.28" dur="5.5">localism and reference to the ZZ</text>
  <text start="171.25" dur="7.45">converted as easy on shikon especially</text>
  <text start="173.78" dur="7.44">you you have these wings that are formed</text>
  <text start="178.7" dur="5.52">and this is why when the woman with the</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="4.62">bleeding grabbed messiahs easy she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.22" dur="3.96">healed because she knew there was</text>
  <text start="185.84" dur="5.73">healing is raised as she knew about</text>
  <text start="188.18" dur="15.66">Malachi so he&amp;#39;s our healer he&amp;#39;s the son</text>
  <text start="191.57" dur="21.78">of righteousness why he waited 400 years</text>
  <text start="203.84" dur="12.299">in Malachi on the Gospels well you know</text>
  <text start="213.35" dur="5.14">you was active because he was active up</text>
  <text start="216.139" dur="5.931">in math</text>
  <text start="218.49" dur="7.63">every time he was involved an actor with</text>
  <text start="222.07" dur="11.91">with Israel why did you rate my corn</text>
  <text start="226.12" dur="9.18">acres times of the father he may have</text>
  <text start="233.98" dur="4.08">been another profits they just weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="235.3" dur="4.38">loud enough to get written about yeah I</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="3.06">know that Messiah had to have been more</text>
  <text start="239.68" dur="2.97">in the fourth millennium from the fourth</text>
  <text start="241.12" dur="4.41">days when the Sun when stars were</text>
  <text start="242.65" dur="6.08">created so when he was born with right</text>
  <text start="245.53" dur="3.2">toward the end of the fourth millennium</text>

  <text start="257.68" dur="6.87">made it through the Old Testament really</text>
  <text start="260.58" dur="5.5">now are in the New Testament so this is</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="4.65">really neat because the four Gospels</text>
  <text start="266.08" dur="7.71">show different aspects of whom Messiah</text>
  <text start="269.2" dur="8.51">is so in Matthew of course he is the</text>
  <text start="273.79" dur="6.75">Messiah many references are made</text>
  <text start="277.71" dur="5.56">in mark which is more of an action</text>
  <text start="280.54" dur="4.56">gospel for a short gospel it highlights</text>
  <text start="283.27" dur="5.97">a lot of his miracles so highlights what</text>
  <text start="285.1" dur="6.24">he does a miracle worker so you know</text>
  <text start="289.24" dur="5.01">here we see who he is he&amp;#39;s massage here</text>
  <text start="291.34" dur="5.97">we see what he does he&amp;#39;s the nerve or</text>
  <text start="294.25" dur="7.68">her talks about all the things he did in</text>
  <text start="297.31" dur="7.05">Luke Luke is tied to Ezekiel to give</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="4.95">Luke the son of man that phrase is used</text>
  <text start="304.36" dur="9.03">over and over and over here and I</text>
  <text start="306.88" dur="10.59">Gospels and John he is there some of</text>
  <text start="313.39" dur="6.12">y&amp;#39;all so southern handle oops I&amp;#39;m yacht</text>
  <text start="317.47" dur="3.33">and gone so just amazing how all of</text>
  <text start="319.51" dur="3">these four Gospels show different</text>
  <text start="320.8" dur="8.37">aspects of who he is and yet they all</text>
  <text start="322.51" dur="14.07">tie together in the book of Acts he is</text>
  <text start="329.17" dur="9">the one who immerses us in fire so this</text>
  <text start="336.58" dur="3.24">of course is all about the fulfillment</text>
  <text start="338.17" dur="3.39">of what we read about and Joel it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="339.82" dur="3.21">fulfillment of shadow wolf or Pentecost</text>
  <text start="341.56" dur="5.16">what we&amp;#39;re baptized in the fire Holy</text>
  <text start="343.03" dur="5.52">Spirit and that&amp;#39;s what about is being</text>
  <text start="346.72" dur="5.49">immersed in this fire and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.55" dur="12.84">able to do when we have that baptism of</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="14.37">the Holy Spirit in Romans he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="361.39" dur="7.8">establisher of the true case which</text>
  <text start="366.58" dur="7.08">strengthens the Tory and that is found</text>
  <text start="369.19" dur="6.9">in Romans 331 so we read about how Paul</text>
  <text start="373.66" dur="4.74">says that the true faith makes strong or</text>
  <text start="376.09" dur="4.2">establishes the Torah and I think this</text>
  <text start="378.4" dur="3.81">is often missed by a lot of Christians</text>
  <text start="380.29" dur="4.54">that I was missed by any when I was</text>
  <text start="382.21" dur="4.12">no idea Romans made reference to the</text>
  <text start="384.83" dur="3.47">Torah but it does it says that true</text>
  <text start="386.33" dur="5.7">faith always will strengthen or</text>
  <text start="388.3" dur="10.869">establish or make strong the toilet is</text>
  <text start="392.03" dur="8.91">long it&amp;#39;s Commandments hmm that&amp;#39;s how we</text>

  <text start="414.139" dur="6.87">her up the Ruach give her a holy spirit</text>
  <text start="416.93" dur="5.94">so kind of similar to ask but it kind of</text>
  <text start="421.009" dur="5.301">goes into more of the purposes of what</text>
  <text start="422.87" dur="8.729">why the was forgiving is to edifying</text>
  <text start="426.31" dur="10.3">goodbye body for science and also is</text>
