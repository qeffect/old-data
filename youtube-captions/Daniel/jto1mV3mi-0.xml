  <text start="51.719" dur="7.5">downtown might normally we&amp;#39;ve been going</text>
  <text start="53.94" dur="6.9">to this park in Portland and the reason</text>
  <text start="59.219" dur="5.461">we decided to do that is just because</text>
  <text start="60.84" dur="6.87">we&amp;#39;ve seen overall anyway a much better</text>
  <text start="64.68" dur="6.11">reception people seem to be more open to</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="5.82">what we&amp;#39;re preaching and if there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="70.79" dur="4.899">out-and-out that there&amp;#39;s really no out</text>
  <text start="73.53" dur="5.25">hostility anymore although I guess</text>
  <text start="75.689" dur="4.741">occasionally there is but either we get</text>
  <text start="78.78" dur="3.6">people who are very encouraged by what</text>
  <text start="80.43" dur="4.71">we say and come up and check our hands</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="5.309">or we get people who at least are</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="4.08">willing to sit there and listen which is</text>
  <text start="87.689" dur="3.601">kind of what Jerry and I want we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="89.22" dur="4.37">we&amp;#39;re not really our purpose is not to</text>
  <text start="91.29" dur="4.899">go out try to start a riot or</text>
  <text start="93.59" dur="4.739">start problems or anything like that so</text>
  <text start="96.189" dur="3.64">that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;ve been going and and</text>
  <text start="98.329" dur="3.271">that&amp;#39;s sort of the reason why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="99.829" dur="4.32">continue to go there there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="101.6" dur="3.78">families there and so anyway I would</text>
  <text start="104.149" dur="3.811">just ask those out there to just</text>
  <text start="105.38" dur="4.739">continue to pray we actually have a</text>
  <text start="107.96" dur="3.749">couple of people from our congregation</text>

  <text start="131.15" dur="2.449">second</text>
  <text start="138.86" dur="5.01">I just want to read a psalm that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="141.83" dur="5.88">odds of putting on my heart and it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="143.87" dur="6.39">Psalm 127 except it says except Yahweh</text>
  <text start="147.71" dur="5.07">build the house they labor in vain that</text>
  <text start="150.26" dur="6.42">building except Yahweh keep the city the</text>
  <text start="152.78" dur="6.66">watchman waketh but in vain it is vain</text>
  <text start="156.68" dur="4.56">to rise up early to sit up late to eat</text>
  <text start="159.44" dur="4.89">the bread of Sorrows for so he giveth</text>
  <text start="161.24" dur="4.62">his beloved sleep you know it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="164.33" dur="3.92">important that we make sure that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="165.86" dur="4.59">is the foundation of everything we do</text>
  <text start="168.25" dur="6.07">whether it&amp;#39;s going out to minister</text>
  <text start="170.45" dur="6.69">whether it&amp;#39;s keeping Shabbat you know</text>
  <text start="174.32" dur="5.94">that he is the foundation because if</text>
  <text start="177.14" dur="6.569">we&amp;#39;re just doing things for our own</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="6.89">benefit for our own purposes it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="183.709" dur="5.48">going to be in vain all of it</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="4.289">one of the things that yaakov having me</text>
  <text start="189.189" dur="5.011">preach last shabbat with that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="191.439" dur="5.52">come to yah for what we can get out of</text>
  <text start="194.2" dur="5.429">him we come to yah we come to the</text>
  <text start="196.959" dur="4.62">Messiah for we can give to him how we</text>
  <text start="199.629" dur="3.541">can bless him how we can glorify him</text>
  <text start="201.579" dur="5.011">that should be our attitude that should</text>
  <text start="203.17" dur="6.3">be our heart is how can we bless and how</text>
  <text start="206.59" dur="5.13">can we put a smile on his face not to</text>
  <text start="209.47" dur="4.71">say that his blessings aren&amp;#39;t blessings</text>
  <text start="211.72" dur="4.379">upon us aren&amp;#39;t a huge part of our of our</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="5.309">walk with him obviously that&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="216.099" dur="4.92">important but if the only reason we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="219.489" dur="2.701">serving in is to see what we can get</text>
  <text start="221.019" dur="3.201">from him they were completely</text>
  <text start="222.19" dur="4.23">approaching in from the wrong foundation</text>
  <text start="224.22" dur="5.769">for the wrong purpose for the wrong</text>
  <text start="226.42" dur="6.48">motive our life is not our own our life</text>
  <text start="229.989" dur="5.25">is his and we need to make sure that</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="4.41">when we go out to do preaching or</text>
  <text start="235.239" dur="3.961">ministry or when we&amp;#39;re keeping Shabbat</text>
  <text start="237.31" dur="3.78">when we&amp;#39;re doing his commandments that</text>
  <text start="239.2" dur="5.189">we&amp;#39;re doing these things to bring a</text>
  <text start="241.09" dur="5.94">smile to his face that ultimately is the</text>
  <text start="244.389" dur="5.701">reason why we service is to bring a</text>
  <text start="247.03" dur="6.9">smile to his face that&amp;#39;s what psalm 119</text>
  <text start="250.09" dur="5.67">is all about is David crying out for yah</text>
  <text start="253.93" dur="5.1">to help him walk in the commandments and</text>
  <text start="255.76" dur="5.699">walk in the statutes to bring him</text>
  <text start="259.03" dur="4.05">pleasure to bring a smile to his face in</text>
  <text start="261.459" dur="4.651">fact even in the book of Revelation it</text>
  <text start="263.08" dur="6.329">says that all creatures all creatures</text>
  <text start="266.11" dur="8.339">are made for his pleasure in his</text>
  <text start="269.409" dur="6.931">pleasure alone now yes definitely in</text>
  <text start="274.449" dur="4.381">this culture which is a very humanistic</text>
  <text start="276.34" dur="5.009">culture centered on us centered on</text>
  <text start="278.83" dur="3.839">humans what we can get whether it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="281.349" dur="2.611">the church world or whether it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="282.669" dur="3.12">second the world it seems like that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.96" dur="3.78">the prevailing attitude it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="285.789" dur="4.681">us it&amp;#39;s all about what we can get how we</text>
  <text start="287.74" dur="3.959">can get blessings and all this stuff and</text>
  <text start="290.47" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s really not what it&amp;#39;s about at all</text>
  <text start="291.699" dur="5.371">it&amp;#39;s about glorifying him and exalting</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="6.42">him and making sure he</text>
  <text start="297.07" dur="6.24">he is the number one person in our life</text>
  <text start="300.85" dur="6.66">but also making sure that all that we do</text>
  <text start="303.31" dur="9.69">is for him although we do is to bring</text>
  <text start="307.51" dur="7.08">him pleasure and you know we may when we</text>
  <text start="313" dur="3.39">first start serving and we made that</text>
  <text start="314.59" dur="3.93">maybe our heart attitude and sometimes</text>
  <text start="316.39" dur="3.45">we can get rusty and stale and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.52" dur="3.33">just sort of going through the motions</text>
  <text start="319.84" dur="5.49">and we need to always make sure that</text>
  <text start="321.85" dur="5.49">that doesn&amp;#39;t take a hold of us that</text>
  <text start="325.33" dur="6.87">we&amp;#39;re that we are centered on bringing</text>
  <text start="327.34" dur="6.81">him glory and him glory alone because if</text>
  <text start="332.2" dur="3.3">we&amp;#39;re not doing that if we&amp;#39;re just sort</text>
  <text start="334.15" dur="3.45">of going through the motions it just</text>
  <text start="335.5" dur="4.11">sort of you know keeping Shabbat and you</text>
  <text start="337.6" dur="4.17">know going and the ministry or whatever</text>
  <text start="339.61" dur="3.81">and we&amp;#39;re just sort of doing it then</text>
  <text start="341.77" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re going to lose we&amp;#39;re going to lose</text>
  <text start="343.42" dur="4.62">the real intent and purpose of what it</text>
  <text start="346" dur="4.98">means to serve him which is to bring him</text>
  <text start="348.04" dur="4.86">a smile which is ring him joy and that</text>
  <text start="350.98" dur="3.72">ultimately when we do that when we give</text>
  <text start="352.9" dur="4.11">up our life and bring him joy and center</text>
  <text start="354.7" dur="4.68">on how to please him that does actually</text>
  <text start="357.01" dur="5.04">bring us joy and we&amp;#39;re just sort of</text>
  <text start="359.38" dur="7.14">living for ourselves whether we painted</text>
  <text start="362.05" dur="7.8">in religious talk or not are the joy</text>
  <text start="366.52" dur="5.19">quick quickly leaves so we just need to</text>
  <text start="369.85" dur="2.73">remember that the main reason and again</text>
  <text start="371.71" dur="3.15">I&amp;#39;m not saying there&amp;#39;s anything wrong</text>
  <text start="372.58" dur="4.47">with God&amp;#39;s blessing in our lives is</text>
  <text start="374.86" dur="4.53">blessings should definitely be evident</text>
  <text start="377.05" dur="5.19">in our lives but that our focus should</text>
