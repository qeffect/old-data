  <text start="0.41" dur="5.83">Shalom this is daniel john lee with</text>
  <text start="2.85" dur="7.34">torah restoration ministries this is my</text>
  <text start="6.24" dur="6.359">midweek podcast and this is episode 19</text>
  <text start="10.19" dur="6.4">the thought of this podcast is the</text>
  <text start="12.599" dur="6.69">parabolic parable and this podcast is</text>
  <text start="16.59" dur="7.23">based off a teaching if you go to my</text>
  <text start="19.289" dur="7.74">website wwwspa- aam on the left hand</text>
  <text start="23.82" dur="5.459">side you will see a link marked</text>
  <text start="27.029" dur="4.051">teachings if you click on teachings you</text>
  <text start="29.279" dur="7.011">will see the parabolic parable listed</text>
  <text start="31.08" dur="9.2">toward the top this is a article I wrote</text>
  <text start="36.29" dur="6.13">several years ago and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="40.28" dur="4.779">explore this article further and</text>
  <text start="42.42" dur="4.26">highlight it in a podcast because i</text>
  <text start="45.059" dur="5.16">think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s important i think it</text>
  <text start="46.68" dur="5.85">contains information that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="50.219" dur="7.101">beautiful and also important</text>
  <text start="52.53" dur="6.9">prophetically the parabolic parable so</text>
  <text start="57.32" dur="5.919">basically as you can see from the</text>
  <text start="59.43" dur="6.689">picture on this podcast we are looking</text>
  <text start="63.239" dur="6.711">at a map of the seven congregations that</text>
  <text start="66.119" dur="7.161">are listed in the book of Revelation and</text>
  <text start="69.95" dur="7.51">what&amp;#39;s interesting to note is that</text>
  <text start="73.28" dur="8.44">geographically the seven congregations</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="6.56">have a an order to them have a that they</text>
  <text start="81.72" dur="5.789">actually form a parabolic shape</text>
  <text start="84.02" dur="5.62">geographically so if you follow the</text>
  <text start="87.509" dur="3.781">order of the congregation&amp;#39;s as they are</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="3.81">listed in the book of Revelation of</text>
  <text start="91.29" dur="4.5">course you start with emesis you go to</text>
  <text start="93.45" dur="5.099">Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis</text>
  <text start="95.79" dur="5.43">Philadelphia and Laodicea and as you can</text>
  <text start="98.549" dur="6.511">see by the map each of these locations</text>
  <text start="101.22" dur="7.32">are in order so you start with Ephesus</text>
  <text start="105.06" dur="6.3">you move north west up the coast to</text>
  <text start="108.54" dur="6.48">Smyrna then you take a slight curve to</text>
  <text start="111.36" dur="6.81">the to the northeast to Pergamum and</text>
  <text start="115.02" dur="7.709">then you start going south again down</text>
  <text start="118.17" dur="8.519">toward the south west to Thyatira Sardis</text>
  <text start="122.729" dur="10.711">Philadelphia and eventually Laodicea so</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="7.621">it literally forms a parabolic shape now</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="6.769">the</text>
  <text start="134.31" dur="8.429">parabola is a mathematical concept and</text>
  <text start="140.209" dur="7.241">if you want to know more about what a</text>
  <text start="142.739" dur="8.341">parabola is then you can you can</text>
  <text start="147.45" dur="5.91">certainly google that and find out more</text>
  <text start="151.08" dur="4.769">about what a parabola is in mathematics</text>
  <text start="153.36" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s an interesting concept that</text>
  <text start="155.849" dur="2.67">may help you understand this better I</text>
  <text start="157.11" dur="4.02">actually have a link in the article</text>
  <text start="158.519" dur="5.491">itself that can give you some</text>
  <text start="161.13" dur="4.62">information for the parabola but for the</text>
  <text start="164.01" dur="5.699">sake of time I&amp;#39;m not going to to really</text>
  <text start="165.75" dur="6.48">talk about that right right now but what</text>
  <text start="169.709" dur="8.521">we did but but what I did find is that</text>
  <text start="172.23" dur="7.65">the word parabola or parabolic which</text>
  <text start="178.23" dur="4.11">again comes from the mathematical</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="8.01">concept of the parabola that word</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="8.58">literally means parable okay so we know</text>
  <text start="187.89" dur="7.379">that in the Gospels Yahshua Messiah</text>
  <text start="190.92" dur="8.61">Yahshua often spoke through parables so</text>
  <text start="195.269" dur="7.201">this should be a this should be a huge</text>
  <text start="199.53" dur="6.299">red flag for us and really caused us to</text>
  <text start="202.47" dur="4.859">pay attention so here we see that</text>
  <text start="205.829" dur="3.391">Messiah Yahshua through the Apostle</text>
  <text start="207.329" dur="5.311">jochen on in the book of Revelation was</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="5.88">trying to convey to us a parable and a</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="6.599">parable even in the very geographic</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="5.699">order that the cities are mentioned okay</text>
  <text start="219.239" dur="4.201">so many of you may already be familiar</text>
  <text start="220.799" dur="5.28">with the concept i know that it&amp;#39;s taught</text>
  <text start="223.44" dur="6.66">in a lot of sort of old-school baptist</text>
  <text start="226.079" dur="7.021">churches then each congregation sort of</text>
  <text start="230.1" dur="6.09">represents a different era over the past</text>
  <text start="233.1" dur="4.229">two thousand years so Ephesus would be</text>
  <text start="236.19" dur="5.09">an accurate description of the first</text>
  <text start="237.329" dur="8.611">century believers smyrna which describes</text>
  <text start="241.28" dur="6.329">persecution describes the the era of the</text>
  <text start="245.94" dur="4.169">second and third century believers</text>
  <text start="247.609" dur="5.621">Pergamum is a good description of the</text>
  <text start="250.109" dur="4.41">fourth century apostasy the attire is a</text>
  <text start="253.23" dur="4.86">good description of the darkness of the</text>
  <text start="254.519" dur="4.921">Roman Catholic Church which had absolute</text>
  <text start="258.09" dur="3.66">rule from the 5th through the 15th</text>
  <text start="259.44" dur="3.84">centuries Sardis is a good picture of</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="3.11">the Reformation in the fifteenth</text>
  <text start="263.28" dur="3.6">sixteenth and seventeenth centuries</text>
  <text start="264.86" dur="3.19">Philadelphia is a good picture of the</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="3.84">believers in the eighteenth and</text>
  <text start="268.05" dur="4.019">19 centuries in laodicea is a perfect</text>
  <text start="270.72" dur="3.06">description of many lukewarm believers</text>
  <text start="272.069" dur="5.82">in the twentieth and now twenty-first</text>
  <text start="273.78" dur="6.59">centuries okay now I want you to look at</text>
  <text start="277.889" dur="5.011">this map that I have here on the podcast</text>
  <text start="280.37" dur="7.03">and I want you to follow the parabola</text>
  <text start="282.9" dur="7.859">and you&amp;#39;re going to see that at first</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="7.65">when we begin in Ephesus we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="290.759" dur="7.831">in modern day Turkey and it looks as if</text>
  <text start="295.05" dur="7.649">the line as your as you&amp;#39;re connecting</text>
  <text start="298.59" dur="6.299">the dot from Ephesus to Smyrna it looks</text>
  <text start="302.699" dur="5.071">like the line is headed in the opposite</text>
  <text start="304.889" dur="7.08">direction of Israel okay so Israel lies</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="6.98">to the south east and we&amp;#39;re heading over</text>
  <text start="311.969" dur="6.991">heading in the north to the northwest</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="8.259">toward Europe but then the line curves</text>
  <text start="318.96" dur="6.69">back starting at Pergamum and then is</text>
  <text start="323.009" dur="7.171">now heading straight southeast aiming</text>
  <text start="325.65" dur="7.29">directly for Israel and for Jerusalem so</text>
  <text start="330.18" dur="4.5">I think if that speaks to us even though</text>
  <text start="332.94" dur="3.33">it seems as if the church age has been</text>
  <text start="334.68" dur="3.9">moving farther and farther from the</text>
  <text start="336.27" dur="5.28">truth of Torah of Israel and of the</text>
  <text start="338.58" dur="6.119">Hebrew roots it is steadily marching</text>
  <text start="341.55" dur="7.5">back toward Israel toward Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="344.699" dur="6.511">itself hallelujah now if you look at the</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="5.76">map again if you look at the water the</text>
  <text start="351.21" dur="5.549">the agency as a sort of picture of the</text>
  <text start="354.81" dur="3.419">living water even the tour out with</text>
  <text start="356.759" dur="4.201">Joshua provides for those who love them</text>
  <text start="358.229" dur="4.891">you&amp;#39;re going to see that the first three</text>
  <text start="360.96" dur="3.63">congregations are at the coast so</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="4.169">they&amp;#39;re near the water there near the</text>
  <text start="364.59" dur="4.829">Torah the Hebrews of the faith and if</text>
  <text start="367.289" dur="3.511">you look historically in the first three</text>
  <text start="369.419" dur="3.571">or four centuries that these three</text>
  <text start="370.8" dur="3.6">congregations described the Torah was</text>
  <text start="372.99" dur="4.44">being practiced by at least some</text>
  <text start="374.4" dur="4.829">believers then of course once you get to</text>
  <text start="377.43" dur="3.359">Thyatira you&amp;#39;re very far away from the</text>
  <text start="379.229" dur="5.12">water from Torah and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="380.789" dur="3.56">line is getting farther from the water</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="4.09">but by the time you get to layer to see</text>
  <text start="386.909" dur="3.841">the pair back line is once more nearing</text>
  <text start="388.74" dur="5.789">the water again the Torah as its</text>
  <text start="390.75" dur="5.639">pointing back toward Jerusalem so</text>
  <text start="394.529" dur="3.51">although the parabolic church age has</text>
  <text start="396.389" dur="3.131">been going in a wrong direction is now</text>
  <text start="398.039" dur="3.551">being forced back curve</text>
  <text start="399.52" dur="4.47">act where it should be not at its</text>
  <text start="401.59" dur="4.079">beginning point even latter half of the</text>
  <text start="403.99" dur="2.94">first century when the early believers</text>
  <text start="405.669" dur="2.34">kept Torah and were filled with the</text>
  <text start="406.93" dur="3.9">spirit but the bride was still in its</text>
  <text start="408.009" dur="5.491">infancy but it&amp;#39;s going straight back to</text>
  <text start="410.83" dur="5.1">Jerusalem and the Torah where Yahshua</text>
  <text start="413.5" dur="6.84">revived the torn the prophets two</text>
  <text start="415.93" dur="6.9">thousand years ago so I hope that this</text>
  <text start="420.34" dur="4.34">kind of forms a very clear picture in</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="5.13">your mind that even in the geographic</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="5.769">location of these congregations you can</text>
  <text start="427.96" dur="8.489">see that it paints a very clear picture</text>
  <text start="430.449" dur="10.951">and parable in one&amp;#39;s mind that the</text>
  <text start="436.449" dur="8.37">church age the the evolution the growth</text>
  <text start="441.4" dur="5.19">of the body of Messiah is heading back</text>
  <text start="444.819" dur="5.13">toward Torah and is now pointing</text>
  <text start="446.59" dur="6.479">straight back like an arrow toward</text>
  <text start="449.949" dur="4.861">Jerusalem and of course that&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="453.069" dur="4.951">body of Messiah will eventually end up</text>
  <text start="454.81" dur="5.759">after Laodicea that Yahshua will return</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="4.019">and and rule and reign from his throne</text>
  <text start="460.569" dur="3.481">in Jerusalem and that is where the body</text>
  <text start="462.039" dur="6.391">of Messiah the resurrected Saints will</text>
  <text start="464.05" dur="7.549">be for a thousand years so I think that</text>
  <text start="468.43" dur="7.2">that I think that that is very very</text>
  <text start="471.599" dur="6.04">important if you also look something</text>
  <text start="475.63" dur="3.629">that I just sort of figured out after I</text>
  <text start="477.639" dur="3.81">wrote this article is if you look at the</text>
  <text start="479.259" dur="4.951">island of Patmos it&amp;#39;s kind of below</text>
  <text start="481.449" dur="6.21">Ephesus sort of it right there in the</text>
  <text start="484.21" dur="5.97">middle of the Aegean Sea and you know</text>
  <text start="487.659" dur="4.741">John was exiled to that Island the Isle</text>
  <text start="490.18" dur="4.41">of Patmos toward the end of his life and</text>
  <text start="492.4" dur="3.96">of course that&amp;#39;s where he wrote the book</text>
  <text start="494.59" dur="5.549">of revelations where he received the</text>
  <text start="496.36" dur="6.059">revelation from Yahweh so John you know</text>
  <text start="500.139" dur="4.68">with with his concluding book of the</text>
  <text start="502.419" dur="6.15">Bible he kind of he kind of helped to</text>
  <text start="504.819" dur="7.141">launch the the the age the air that were</text>
  <text start="508.569" dur="4.89">in now the the era of the body of</text>
  <text start="511.96" dur="3.18">Messiah and it&amp;#39;s kind of interesting</text>
  <text start="513.459" dur="4.231">that even geographically he&amp;#39;s sort of at</text>
  <text start="515.14" dur="4.86">the beginning of the parable of the</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="3.81">parabola but he&amp;#39;s also sort of right in</text>
  <text start="520" dur="3.93">the middle of the water I mean he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="521.5" dur="6.54">the Torah you know and then it sort of</text>
  <text start="523.93" dur="6.54">it goes from there so these geographic</text>
  <text start="528.04" dur="4.26">locations these parables are used</text>
  <text start="530.47" dur="4.71">throughout Scripture in fact</text>
  <text start="532.3" dur="5.58">when Paul in the book of Galatians you</text>
  <text start="535.18" dur="4.8">might remember he talks about Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="537.88" dur="4.05">and then he talks about the Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="539.98" dur="4.08">from above and he says the Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="541.93" dur="4.469">below on earth is like Mount is akin to</text>
  <text start="544.06" dur="3.93">Mount Sinai but then there&amp;#39;s a Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="546.399" dur="4.021">above from heaven and if you look at a</text>
  <text start="547.99" dur="6.529">map Jerusalem the city of Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="550.42" dur="7.71">Israel is literally just to the north of</text>
  <text start="554.519" dur="6.461">Mount Sinai it&amp;#39;s in a direct line to the</text>
  <text start="558.13" dur="5.16">north so even Paul was using a</text>
  <text start="560.98" dur="5.16">geographic reference when he was was</text>
  <text start="563.29" dur="4.44">describing this allegory this parable in</text>
  <text start="566.14" dur="3.48">the book of Galatians so this is a this</text>
  <text start="567.73" dur="4.049">is a technique that is used throughout</text>
  <text start="569.62" dur="4.35">the the Brit hadashah throughout the</text>
  <text start="571.779" dur="5.131">scriptures and it&amp;#39;s very important to</text>
  <text start="573.97" dur="7.549">remember okay i hope this blessed you</text>
  <text start="576.91" dur="4.609">may god bless you and Shalom</text>
