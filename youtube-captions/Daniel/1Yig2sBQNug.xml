  <text start="182.68" dur="4.08">up with me at the White House at least</text>
  <text start="184.39" dur="4.41">for the first half back in November of</text>
  <text start="186.76" dur="4.199">2018 when I was encouraging President</text>
  <text start="188.8" dur="3.84">Trump about exposing and taking down the</text>
  <text start="190.959" dur="5.341">Satanic pedophiles and then Jeff came up</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="5.04">again to Juno in April for Passover</text>
  <text start="196.3" dur="4.11">where he got baptized and gave his</text>
  <text start="197.68" dur="5.55">testimony for his baptism so Jeff how</text>
  <text start="200.41" dur="4.62">was your flight from Louisiana all the</text>
  <text start="203.23" dur="5.28">way up to Juneau Alaska it was very</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="4.92">interesting from Louisiana to Atlanta</text>
  <text start="208.51" dur="4.65">because I sat next to a lady who was</text>
  <text start="209.95" dur="5.67">very timid about flying and she just</text>
  <text start="213.16" dur="4.32">loved that I was talking to her so once</text>
  <text start="215.62" dur="2.369">we were off the ground she felt so much</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="3.979">better</text>
  <text start="217.989" dur="6.361">yeah and that she was a French professor</text>
  <text start="221.459" dur="6.131">at tic University in Ruston Louisiana</text>
  <text start="224.35" dur="5.4">and she started talking about French and</text>
  <text start="227.59" dur="4.11">I said you know it&amp;#39;s too bad in</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="3.78">Louisiana that there&amp;#39;s it seemed like</text>
  <text start="231.7" dur="4.92">the French dialect is going away she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.53" dur="4.65">oh no no it&amp;#39;s very strong in Louisiana</text>
  <text start="236.62" dur="8.73">since and she says where are you from</text>
  <text start="238.18" dur="10.2">and I said Louisiana then I said you</text>
  <text start="245.35" dur="4.979">know my cousin she taught French and</text>
  <text start="248.38" dur="4.71">well she actually she taught English in</text>
  <text start="250.329" dur="5.491">parish but she she was a she knew French</text>
  <text start="253.09" dur="6.26">and and she was a teacher and she was a</text>
  <text start="255.82" dur="7.29">who uh she and I said Martha Brown said</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="5.29">Martha brown was my pupil and then I</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="3.18">said well what a coincidence and we were</text>
  <text start="264.64" dur="4.26">talking back and forth about Martha</text>
  <text start="266.29" dur="5.79">and had a good old time going to Lena</text>
  <text start="268.9" dur="5.07">and Atlanta is such a huge airport I</text>
  <text start="272.08" dur="3.6">mean it&amp;#39;s like as a city to itself yeah</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="2.97">so you actually had to go the opposite</text>
  <text start="275.68" dur="2.88">direction of where you were eventually</text>
  <text start="276.94" dur="3.72">headed which was Northwest you had to go</text>
  <text start="278.56" dur="4.64">east first from Louisiana to Atlanta and</text>
  <text start="280.66" dur="4.95">then how long was really over in Atlanta</text>
