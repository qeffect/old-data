  <text start="144.7" dur="15.3">Ord because Yahshua and Yahweh are the</text>
  <text start="149.68" dur="14.339">same person you read in Isaiah 96 just</text>
  <text start="160" dur="7.65">one of my favorite passages it says for</text>
  <text start="164.019" dur="9.841">unto us a child is born child was</text>
  <text start="167.65" dur="8.97">Yahshua unto us a son is given that son</text>
  <text start="173.86" dur="5.209">given to us as Yahshua and the</text>
  <text start="176.62" dur="5.52">government shall be upon his shoulder</text>
  <text start="179.069" dur="6.161">Joshua will rule and reign on earth from</text>
  <text start="182.14" dur="4.319">Jerusalem for a thousand years and the</text>
  <text start="185.23" dur="4.19">government shall be upon his shoulder</text>
  <text start="186.459" dur="7.56">and his name shall be called wonderful</text>
  <text start="189.42" dur="9.39">counsellor the mighty yah the</text>
  <text start="194.019" dur="4.791">everlasting father the Prince of Peace</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="9.429">Yahshua is the very expressed image of</text>
  <text start="202.48" dur="10.83">the father hallelujah he is one person</text>
  <text start="208.299" dur="7.201">he is also a HOD means plurality so he</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="5.61">can manifest in many different ways the</text>
  <text start="215.5" dur="9.09">Father the Son the Ruach a pillar of</text>
  <text start="218.92" dur="10.26">fire pillar of smoke he can the burning</text>
  <text start="224.59" dur="6.33">bush but he is one person don&amp;#39;t anyone</text>
  <text start="229.18" dur="9.649">let don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t let anyone tell</text>
  <text start="230.92" dur="13.68">you otherwise who is Israel who is</text>
  <text start="238.829" dur="10.78">Israel Ephesians chapter 2 tells us very</text>
  <text start="244.6" dur="7.259">clearly who Israel is well I should say</text>
  <text start="249.609" dur="5.22">that there are many passages in</text>
  <text start="251.859" dur="6.841">scripture from the very beginning to the</text>
  <text start="254.829" dur="5.371">very end that show us exactly who Israel</text>
  <text start="258.7" dur="5.58">is but the reason why I like Ephesians</text>
  <text start="260.2" dur="5.55">chapter 2 is because</text>
  <text start="264.28" dur="5.49">I think it very very clearly</text>
  <text start="265.75" dur="6.9">demonstrates what difference there are</text>
  <text start="269.77" dur="6.93">between Gentiles who believe in yah and</text>
  <text start="272.65" dur="7.83">Jews who believed in yon and actually</text>
  <text start="276.7" dur="7.4">there&amp;#39;s no difference at all because we</text>
  <text start="280.48" dur="6.12">read in Ephesians 2 starting in verse 11</text>
  <text start="284.1" dur="7">wherefore remember that you being in</text>
  <text start="286.6" dur="6.45">times past Gentiles in the flesh who are</text>
  <text start="291.1" dur="3.36">called uncircumcision by that which is</text>
  <text start="293.05" dur="4.41">called the circumcision in the flesh</text>
  <text start="294.46" dur="6.3">made by hands that at that time you were</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="5.82">without Messiah being aliens from the</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="4.95">Commonwealth of Israel and strangers</text>
  <text start="303.28" dur="5.82">from the covenants of promise having no</text>
  <text start="305.71" dur="6.83">hope and without yah on the world but</text>
  <text start="309.1" dur="6.96">now in Messiah Yahshua you who sometimes</text>
  <text start="312.54" dur="9.28">were far off are made nigh by the blood</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="7.859">of Messiah for he is our peace who has</text>
  <text start="321.82" dur="4.7">both made us one and have broken down</text>
  <text start="323.919" dur="4.981">the middle wall of partition between us</text>
  <text start="326.52" dur="6.52">he broke down that middle wall so that</text>
  <text start="328.9" dur="7.26">has a Jew or Gentile we are all one in</text>
  <text start="333.04" dur="10.05">Messiah Yahshua were all part of the</text>
  <text start="336.16" dur="11.16">Commonwealth of Israel having abolished</text>
  <text start="343.09" dur="7.139">in his flesh the enmity contained in the</text>
  <text start="347.32" dur="6.84">ordinances for to make himself of Twain</text>
  <text start="350.229" dur="6.241">one new man so making Shalom peace that</text>
  <text start="354.16" dur="6.24">he might reconcile both unto yah in one</text>
  <text start="356.47" dur="6.63">body by the cross Hebrew letter tov</text>
  <text start="360.4" dur="5.07">represents the cross having slain the</text>
  <text start="363.1" dur="4.62">enmity thereby and came and preached</text>
  <text start="365.47" dur="6.78">peace to you which were afar often to</text>
  <text start="367.72" dur="8.55">them that were near Yahshua has made us</text>
  <text start="372.25" dur="8.76">all one in him the commandments the</text>
  <text start="376.27" dur="7.17">Torah that was given to Israel is given</text>
  <text start="381.01" dur="7.17">to everyone who is grafted into Israel</text>
  <text start="383.44" dur="8.07">by the blood of Messiah if you&amp;#39;re born a</text>
  <text start="388.18" dur="6.87">Jew but you deny the blood covenant of</text>
  <text start="391.51" dur="5.979">Yahshua you&amp;#39;re not really a Jew you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="395.05" dur="7.31">been broken off</text>
  <text start="397.489" dur="7.72">if you&amp;#39;re a Gentile Christian who denies</text>
  <text start="402.36" dur="6.449">the Torah doesn&amp;#39;t want to keep the</text>
  <text start="405.209" dur="8.31">commandments you&amp;#39;re not truly a follower</text>
  <text start="408.809" dur="8.13">of Yahshua we need both the blood</text>
  <text start="413.519" dur="7.89">atonement of Yahshua and the Torah the</text>
  <text start="416.939" dur="7.74">commandments so that we can truly follow</text>
  <text start="421.409" dur="5.43">Yahshua when we&amp;#39;re grafted into Israel</text>

  <text start="443.939" dur="5.24">middle wall of partition and we should</text>
  <text start="446.219" dur="7.2">no longer have enmity toward the Torah</text>
  <text start="449.179" dur="8.621">rather now the Torah is life unto us is</text>
  <text start="453.419" dur="6.691">a joy to keep as jochen on the Apostle</text>
