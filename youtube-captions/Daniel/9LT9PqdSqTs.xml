  <text start="380.949" dur="2.701">but there&amp;#39;s these people within the</text>
  <text start="382.27" dur="4.049">messianic hebrew roots movement where</text>
  <text start="383.65" dur="5.1">they tried to diminish who Yahshua is by</text>
  <text start="386.319" dur="5.19">saying well he&amp;#39;s just a man he&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="4.969">prophet he&amp;#39;s just yeah yeah in a certain</text>

  <text start="400.81" dur="3.06">didn&amp;#39;t have anything that we didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="401.979" dur="3.69">during that time that he was on her two</text>
  <text start="403.87" dur="3.12">thousand years ago and he was tempted in</text>
  <text start="405.669" dur="3.24">every way as we were in yet he never</text>
  <text start="406.99" dur="5.79">yield of descent so in that sense yes he</text>
  <text start="408.909" dur="5.73">was just a man but this was not just a</text>
