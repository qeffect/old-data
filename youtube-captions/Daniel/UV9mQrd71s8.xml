  <text start="12.78" dur="4.499">the one before this was Roanoke but</text>
  <text start="14.82" dur="3.99">Roanoke disappeared it&amp;#39;s very mysterious</text>
  <text start="17.279" dur="5.67">actually made a YouTube about Roanoke</text>
  <text start="18.81" dur="6.36">back in 2013 in any case we&amp;#39;re here at</text>
  <text start="22.949" dur="4.771">Jamestown which is just a hop skip and a</text>
  <text start="25.17" dur="4.71">jump from Colonial Williamsburg you know</text>
  <text start="27.72" dur="3.42">it took three days or two and three</text>
  <text start="29.88" dur="3.78">quarters days just to go through all</text>
  <text start="31.14" dur="4.919">Colonial Williamsburg but here we are</text>

  <text start="43.02" dur="5.51">tomorrow but wanted to come to Jamestown</text>
  <text start="45.96" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s a church that was erected</text>
  <text start="48.53" dur="4.029">actually that&amp;#39;s I was built more</text>
  <text start="50.85" dur="3.24">recently the site of the actual church</text>
  <text start="52.559" dur="4.831">was here they&amp;#39;re sort of reconstructing</text>
  <text start="54.09" dur="4.83">it but that&amp;#39;s a statue of John Smith who</text>
  <text start="57.39" dur="5.16">would marry Pocahontas he became the</text>
  <text start="58.92" dur="4.92">first governor here of Virginia but this</text>
  <text start="62.55" dur="3.389">is the first settlement Jamestown this</text>
  <text start="63.84" dur="3.84">is a kind of a replica but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="65.939" dur="7.47">actually standing at the actual site of</text>
  <text start="67.68" dur="7.439">the jamestown settlement and so me and</text>
  <text start="73.409" dur="5.971">some subscribers came out here to enjoy</text>
  <text start="75.119" dur="6.241">this it&amp;#39;s a scale model so again just so</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="4.68">you guys understand this was the first</text>
  <text start="81.36" dur="5.67">settlement but they and this was the</text>
  <text start="84.06" dur="6.21">capital of Virginia but they moved this</text>
  <text start="87.03" dur="4.949">capital to Williamsburg because there</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="4.739">was just too many mosquitoes down here</text>
  <text start="91.979" dur="5.041">and it just wasn&amp;#39;t practical anymore so</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="5.101">they started here in you know 1607 but</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="4.26">by you know 1699 1700 they moved up to</text>
  <text start="100.11" dur="2.369">Williamsburg which is where I&amp;#39;ve spent</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="5.49">the last three days and that&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="6.151">capital Virginia moved to and of course</text>
  <text start="106.77" dur="5.73">you know that&amp;#39;s where after they broke</text>
  <text start="108.63" dur="7.769">away from Britain in in seventeen you</text>
  <text start="112.5" dur="5.909">know 75 or whatever you know of course</text>
  <text start="116.399" dur="4.171">Patrick Henry became the first governor</text>
  <text start="118.409" dur="3.511">and then Thomas Jefferson who would</text>
  <text start="120.57" dur="3.93">later become the president United States</text>
  <text start="121.92" dur="4.379">he became the second governor but they</text>
  <text start="124.5" dur="4.2">eventually had to move the capital from</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="3.511">Williamsburg right around the outbreak</text>
  <text start="128.7" dur="3.14">of the revolution or they had to move</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="3.35">that to Richmond</text>
  <text start="131.84" dur="5.16">and then they even had to retreat from</text>
  <text start="133.16" dur="8.28">Richmond but in any case this is</text>
  <text start="137" dur="6.959">Jamestown and and we&amp;#39;re just gonna we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="141.44" dur="4.549">just gonna walk along here and enjoy</text>
  <text start="143.959" dur="4.591">this that&amp;#39;s beautiful</text>
  <text start="145.989" dur="5.11">this is the actual fort where it stood</text>
  <text start="148.55" dur="6.18">guys I mean this this is real as it gets</text>
  <text start="151.099" dur="5.371">when it comes to Jamestown so for</text>
  <text start="154.73" dur="8.039">example this is the Chesapeake Bay by</text>
  <text start="156.47" dur="8.07">the way hood uh-huh okay so this is</text>
  <text start="162.769" dur="3.891">fresh water that flows into the Atlantic</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="2.12">Ocean</text>
  <text start="166.93" dur="5.29">here&amp;#39;s a statue of Captain John Smith</text>
  <text start="169.7" dur="5.97">now I&amp;#39;m a little upset with the I think</text>
  <text start="172.22" dur="6.18">the liberal propaganda and bias on this</text>
  <text start="175.67" dur="4.41">because it says when you read this it</text>
  <text start="178.4" dur="4.08">talks about how he&amp;#39;s John Smith&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="180.08" dur="6.36">arrogant guy no one liked him and blah</text>
  <text start="182.48" dur="5.4">blah blah well I don&amp;#39;t think I mean they</text>
  <text start="186.44" dur="4.2">could describe President Trump that way</text>
  <text start="187.88" dur="4.41">you know I hear liberals he was arrogant</text>
  <text start="190.64" dur="3.179">and boastful man often tactless in some</text>
  <text start="192.29" dur="2.94">nice brutal well I&amp;#39;ve heard liberals</text>
  <text start="193.819" dur="2.971">describe President Trump that way so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="195.23" dur="2.819">kind of leery at how to describe him</text>
  <text start="196.79" dur="3.06">Captain John Smith here</text>
  <text start="198.049" dur="4.861">because I had heard good things about</text>
  <text start="199.85" dur="5.669">him he was a devoted Christian and in</text>
  <text start="202.91" dur="5.57">any case he was born in 1580 died 1631</text>
  <text start="205.519" dur="6.09">he was the the first governor here in</text>
  <text start="208.48" dur="8.11">Virginia when the Capitol was here that</text>
  <text start="211.609" dur="7.531">at a Jamestown Sultan of Jamestown so so</text>
  <text start="216.59" dur="6.479">what we&amp;#39;re gonna do that&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="219.14" dur="5.01">replica of what they would live in so</text>

  <text start="307.49" dur="3.6">they had their first settlement they it</text>
  <text start="308.99" dur="4.019">took them 19 days to erect this</text>
  <text start="311.09" dur="5.759">jamestown settlement cuz they were under</text>
  <text start="313.009" dur="5.731">attack by the Indians in Virginia one</text>
  <text start="316.849" dur="4.741">thing to remember though before</text>
  <text start="318.74" dur="4.649">Jamestown when the pilgrims first came</text>
  <text start="321.59" dur="4.5">over here and they celebrated the first</text>
  <text start="323.389" dur="4.62">Thanksgiving that was the Sukkot they</text>
  <text start="326.09" dur="4.079">actually celebrated that forced to coat</text>
  <text start="328.009" dur="4.831">they were keeping Sukkot and in the</text>
  <text start="330.169" dur="4.021">Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 1600s</text>
  <text start="332.84" dur="3.569">they had outlawed Christmas because I</text>
  <text start="334.19" dur="6">knew Christmas was pagan in origin</text>
  <text start="336.409" dur="5.161">in fact even by the late 1700s when the</text>
  <text start="340.19" dur="2.61">Revolutionary Wars being fought even</text>
  <text start="341.57" dur="2.849">though it was no longer illegal to</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="3.089">celebrate Christmas most Americans</text>
  <text start="344.419" dur="4.5">didn&amp;#39;t it was still culturally</text>
  <text start="345.889" dur="6.02">acceptable not to do Christmas pass on</text>
  <text start="348.919" dur="5.101">by their pilgrim and Puritan forefathers</text>
  <text start="351.909" dur="3.701">because they understood it was pagan and</text>
  <text start="354.02" dur="3.619">that&amp;#39;s why I basically George Washington</text>
  <text start="355.61" dur="4.41">was able to win a decisive victory</text>
  <text start="357.639" dur="5.381">against the British because the British</text>
  <text start="360.02" dur="4.56">were having orgies and drunken orgies</text>
  <text start="363.02" dur="3.5">and celebrating their pagan Christmas</text>
  <text start="364.58" dur="3.869">while George Washington ambushed them</text>
  <text start="366.52" dur="5.32">well it was the British and the British</text>
  <text start="368.449" dur="7.46">allies that they ambushed so just a</text>
  <text start="371.84" dur="8.25">little factoid for you guys alright</text>
  <text start="375.909" dur="7.331">Daniel II Jamestown here on the eastern</text>
  <text start="380.09" dur="4.829">rim of the American continent when I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="384.919" dur="3.511">the American continent in Alaska it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.93" dur="3.89">about as far as a way up from Alaska I</text>
