  <text start="2.97" dur="4.949">tour restoration ministries and it is</text>
  <text start="5.67" dur="5.58">sunday evening april the eight that is</text>
  <text start="7.919" dur="5.241">almost the end of the third day of</text>
  <text start="11.25" dur="4.559">unleavened bread here on the west coast</text>
  <text start="13.16" dur="5.23">and today the third day of unleavened</text>
  <text start="15.809" dur="4.831">bread also happened to be the day of</text>
  <text start="18.39" dur="5.309">first fruits and so I wanted to make</text>
  <text start="20.64" dur="4.549">just a very brief podcast about this day</text>
  <text start="23.699" dur="4.681">first fruits and its significance</text>
  <text start="25.189" dur="6.16">because oftentimes in both Jewish and</text>
  <text start="28.38" dur="5.25">messianic Hebrew circles this day tends</text>
  <text start="31.349" dur="4.011">to get overlooked and it shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="33.63" dur="4.999">overlooked because it&amp;#39;s an extremely</text>
  <text start="35.36" dur="5.949">significant day on the Hebrew calendar</text>
  <text start="38.629" dur="5.831">if you open up your scriptures to</text>
  <text start="41.309" dur="5.311">Leviticus chapter 23 you&amp;#39;ll find of</text>
  <text start="44.46" dur="4.02">course that that chapter lists all seven</text>
  <text start="46.62" dur="3.45">of the major feast starting with the</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="4.469">Sabbath and going through Passover and</text>
  <text start="50.07" dur="7.2">on and on throughout the end of the the</text>
  <text start="52.949" dur="7.02">end of the fees when it talks about the</text>
  <text start="57.27" dur="5.55">Passover it of course talks about the</text>
  <text start="59.969" dur="4.381">seven days of unleavened bread it talks</text>
  <text start="62.82" dur="4.65">about how the first day in the seventh</text>
  <text start="64.35" dur="4.68">day are high Sabbath&amp;#39;s and then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="67.47" dur="4.439">an interesting passage right after that</text>
  <text start="69.03" dur="6.449">which talks about the morrow after the</text>
  <text start="71.909" dur="4.921">Sabbath now because of the context in</text>
  <text start="75.479" dur="3.601">the way it&amp;#39;s presented its presented</text>
  <text start="76.83" dur="5.039">just after the scriptures talk about the</text>
  <text start="79.08" dur="5.49">seven days in leavened bread we are left</text>
  <text start="81.869" dur="5.161">to assume and most Jews have assumed</text>
  <text start="84.57" dur="3.839">over the centuries that when the</text>
  <text start="87.03" dur="2.9">scriptures talk about the morrow after</text>
  <text start="88.409" dur="5.07">the Sabbath it&amp;#39;s referring to the</text>
  <text start="89.93" dur="5.53">regular weekly sabbath day that falls</text>
  <text start="93.479" dur="5.521">within the seven days of unleavened</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="4.86">bread and so the morrow after the</text>
  <text start="99" dur="3.81">Sabbath of course it&amp;#39;s always going to</text>
  <text start="100.32" dur="4.589">fall on a Sunday but depending on when</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="3.96">Passover occurs and when the seven days</text>
  <text start="104.909" dur="3.631">of unleavened bread occurs will</text>
  <text start="106.77" dur="4.11">determine when the day of the</text>
  <text start="108.54" dur="5.039">firstfruits is so it always occurs at</text>
  <text start="110.88" dur="4.529">the morrow after the Sabbath now the</text>
  <text start="113.579" dur="5.131">firstfruits is extremely important</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="5.221">agriculturally and the reason why is in</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="3.9">order to begin the new year you always</text>
  <text start="120.63" dur="5.25">have to wait for the new moon following</text>
  <text start="122.61" dur="6.869">the spring equinox now why is that well</text>
  <text start="125.88" dur="5.34">there&amp;#39;s several articles at ww spirit</text>
  <text start="129.479" dur="3.931">and torque on that you can read about to</text>
  <text start="131.22" dur="4.02">find out why one of the most important</text>
  <text start="133.41" dur="3.81">about why you have to wait for the first</text>
  <text start="135.24" dur="3.99">new moon after the spring equinox to</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="5.31">declare the new year is because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="5.52">the only time when all the barley which</text>
  <text start="142.53" dur="5.31">is the first major harvest in Israel is</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="6.03">completely ripe or Aviv throughout the</text>
  <text start="147.84" dur="5.46">entire land of Israel now why does all</text>
  <text start="150.78" dur="4.38">the barley have to be completely Aviv or</text>
  <text start="153.3" dur="3.9">ripe throughout the entire land of</text>
  <text start="155.16" dur="5.07">Israel well it&amp;#39;s because of this day of</text>
  <text start="157.2" dur="4.71">firstfruits you see when the tribes of</text>
  <text start="160.23" dur="5.04">the children of Israel come up to</text>
  <text start="161.91" dur="5.31">Jerusalem for Passover they have to</text>
  <text start="165.27" dur="4.35">present the first fruits of their barley</text>
  <text start="167.22" dur="4.11">harvest that means they&amp;#39;ve had to have</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="3.99">harvested had enough time to have</text>
  <text start="171.33" dur="4.5">harvested their barley crop and to take</text>
  <text start="173.61" dur="4.47">a shock of the the firstfruits of that</text>
  <text start="175.83" dur="4.38">crop and bring it up to Jerusalem during</text>
  <text start="178.08" dur="4.68">the Passover Feast and whenever</text>
  <text start="180.21" dur="6.09">firstfruits falls within that seven days</text>
  <text start="182.76" dur="6.78">that they&amp;#39;re up at the at Jerusalem on</text>
  <text start="186.3" dur="5.64">that day they take their shocks of</text>
  <text start="189.54" dur="4.35">barley and they present it to the</text>
  <text start="191.94" dur="4.89">priests who then transfer to the high</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="5.43">priest the high priest also symbolically</text>
  <text start="196.83" dur="6.629">would go out into the fields nearest</text>
  <text start="199.32" dur="6.51">Jerusalem and would would harvest his</text>
  <text start="203.459" dur="4.411">first shock of barley from from the the</text>
  <text start="205.83" dur="5.37">fields outside of Jerusalem that the</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="5.31">priests would tend to and of course now</text>
  <text start="211.2" dur="4.35">first fruits this day is not considered</text>
  <text start="213.18" dur="5.93">a Sabbath because you know you wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="215.55" dur="5.7">go out and harvest your barley or or</text>
  <text start="219.11" dur="4.36">take your shocks of Barlow that you</text>
  <text start="221.25" dur="4.739">brought up with you from your respective</text>
  <text start="223.47" dur="3.6">lands and presented to the priest on the</text>
  <text start="225.989" dur="2.911">Sabbath day that&amp;#39;s just not something</text>
  <text start="227.07" dur="5.16">you would do on the Sabbath day because</text>
  <text start="228.9" dur="6.059">it be considered work one thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.23" dur="4.65">interesting that Jewish tradition talks</text>
  <text start="234.959" dur="4.621">about and I I like this tradition</text>
  <text start="236.88" dur="4.62">because it has scriptural roots and that</text>
  <text start="239.58" dur="5.31">is the high priest could not be touched</text>
  <text start="241.5" dur="5.85">by anyone physically until he gathered</text>
  <text start="244.89" dur="4.77">those shocks of barley and waved them as</text>
  <text start="247.35" dur="3.57">an offering in the holy place and the</text>
  <text start="249.66" dur="3.75">reason I say that that tradition is</text>
  <text start="250.92" dur="5.55">scriptural is because if he were to go</text>
  <text start="253.41" dur="4.71">into the holy place if anyone were to</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="5.13">touch him before going into the holy</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="6.99">place he would be unclean so no one was</text>
  <text start="261.6" dur="5.12">allowed to touch him before he went into</text>
  <text start="265.11" dur="3.56">that holy place and presented</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="4.32">the wave offering of that barley harvest</text>
  <text start="268.67" dur="5.79">in the holy place on the day of first</text>
  <text start="271.04" dur="4.86">fruits on Sunday essentially or it might</text>
  <text start="274.46" dur="3.87">even occur Saturday night because</text>
  <text start="275.9" dur="4.8">remember the day begins at night in the</text>
  <text start="278.33" dur="5.61">Jewish Hebrew calendar so they could</text>
  <text start="280.7" dur="5.49">even do it saturday night well Yahshua</text>
  <text start="283.94" dur="6">fulfilled this because even though he</text>
  <text start="286.19" dur="6.27">resurrected on Twilight at Sabbath so</text>
  <text start="289.94" dur="3.63">just before the Shabbat ended the mark</text>
  <text start="292.46" dur="3.33">of the Sabbath which would have been</text>
  <text start="293.57" dur="5.13">Sunday morning even before it was light</text>
  <text start="295.79" dur="4.89">out of course the women discovered and</text>
  <text start="298.7" dur="4.83">Peter and jochen on discovered that the</text>
  <text start="300.68" dur="5.58">tomb was empty and remember Yahshua then</text>
  <text start="303.53" dur="6.09">had an appearance where he exchanged</text>
  <text start="306.26" dur="6.24">words with Miriam and she recognized him</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="5.07">and was reaching to embrace him and he</text>
  <text start="312.5" dur="4.83">says no don&amp;#39;t touch me Gospels record</text>
  <text start="314.69" dur="6.57">that and the reason he says no don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="317.33" dur="5.73">touch me is because he is fulfilling the</text>
  <text start="321.26" dur="4.68">day of firstfruits he is the high priest</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="4.8">and he is the first fruit from among the</text>
  <text start="325.94" dur="4.71">dead and he has not yet ascended to the</text>
  <text start="327.86" dur="4.35">Father on that day to present himself as</text>
  <text start="330.65" dur="3.9">a way of offering of the first fruit</text>
  <text start="332.21" dur="3.99">among the dead to the father so he</text>
  <text start="334.55" dur="4.5">literally fulfills the day of first</text>
  <text start="336.2" dur="6.68">fruit so you know a lot of the</text>
  <text start="339.05" dur="5.7">Christians were celebrating Easter</text>
  <text start="342.88" dur="4.3">excuse me I was just reaching for my</text>
  <text start="344.75" dur="3.51">Bible but Easter is very pagan and has</text>
  <text start="347.18" dur="4.91">nothing to do with the Scriptures</text>
  <text start="348.26" dur="7.74">firstfruits of course in every way</text>
  <text start="352.09" dur="6.34">symbolizes the symbolizes and points</text>
  <text start="356" dur="5.22">toward Joshua and Yahshua fulfilled this</text>
  <text start="358.43" dur="4.23">day that was done by Jews for thousands</text>
  <text start="361.22" dur="5.22">of years let me just read real quickly</text>
  <text start="362.66" dur="6.56">here from Leviticus chapter 23 this is</text>
  <text start="366.44" dur="6.6">the only place in the entire scriptures</text>
  <text start="369.22" dur="6.009">Torah or otherwise where this feast are</text>
  <text start="373.04" dur="5.189">not really a feast but this day is</text>
  <text start="375.229" dur="6.901">referred to and it&amp;#39;s in Leviticus</text>
  <text start="378.229" dur="6.69">chapter 23 starting in verse 9 and you</text>
  <text start="382.13" dur="3.96">always speak to mo che saying speak to</text>
  <text start="384.919" dur="3.031">the children of Israel and say to them</text>
  <text start="386.09" dur="4.2">when you come into the land which I give</text>
  <text start="387.95" dur="3.93">to you and reap its harvest then you</text>
  <text start="390.29" dur="3.93">shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits</text>
  <text start="391.88" dur="3.99">of your harvest to the priests he shall</text>
  <text start="394.22" dur="4.33">wave the sheaf before Yahweh to be</text>
  <text start="395.87" dur="4.81">accepted on your behalf on the day after</text>
  <text start="398.55" dur="4.41">Sabbath the pre-show a bit so this would</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="4.02">be Sunday every year and you shall offer</text>
  <text start="402.96" dur="2.97">on that day when you wave the sheaf a</text>
  <text start="404.7" dur="3">male lamb of the first year without</text>
  <text start="405.93" dur="4.65">blemish is a burnt offering to Yahweh</text>
  <text start="407.7" dur="5.13">its grain offering shall be to 1075 of</text>
  <text start="410.58" dur="4.35">fine flour mixed with oil an offering</text>
  <text start="412.83" dur="4.23">made by fire to Yahweh for sweet aroma</text>
  <text start="414.93" dur="4.26">and as drink offering shall be of wine</text>
  <text start="417.06" dur="4.35">one fourth of a hint you shall eat</text>
  <text start="419.19" dur="3.69">neither bread nor parched grain or fresh</text>
  <text start="421.41" dur="3.3">green until the same day that you have</text>
  <text start="422.88" dur="3.99">brought an offering to your Elohim it</text>
  <text start="424.71" dur="5.04">should be a statute forever throughout</text>
  <text start="426.87" dur="5.19">your generations in all your dwellings</text>
  <text start="429.75" dur="3.93">and then verse 15 is interesting it says</text>
  <text start="432.06" dur="3.78">and you shall count for yourselves from</text>
  <text start="433.68" dur="3.51">the day after the Sabbath from the day</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="3.45">that you brought the sheave of the wave</text>
  <text start="437.19" dur="4.56">offering seven sabes shall be completed</text>
  <text start="439.29" dur="4.29">count fifty days to the day after the</text>
  <text start="441.75" dur="3.36">seventh Sabbath then you shall offered</text>
  <text start="443.58" dur="3.57">it so then it goes into the feast of</text>
  <text start="445.11" dur="3.63">shadow which is the next major feast on</text>
  <text start="447.15" dur="4.65">the Hebrew calendar so you can see</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="6.93">firstfruits this day this year is april</text>

  <text start="458.58" dur="4.38">days which will take us to May 27th</text>

  <text start="464.82" dur="3.66">shallow and I actually have an article</text>
  <text start="466.29" dur="5.36">about that on the website so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.48" dur="9.03">another very significant point about</text>
  <text start="471.65" dur="7.99">firstfruits now paul also in the New</text>
