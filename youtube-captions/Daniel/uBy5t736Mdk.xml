  <text start="105.299" dur="3.871">and shine was the herald and perhaps</text>
  <text start="106.95" dur="5.959">this is why Satan named the first planet</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="6.54">Mercury however we call it the Saviour</text>
  <text start="112.909" dur="5.261">this planet is hidden from view by the</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="5.43">Sun this represents in theology that</text>
  <text start="118.17" dur="4.71">Messiah independently restricted the use</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="3.81">of his deity in order to fulfill the</text>

  <text start="149.13" dur="7.2">six is Saturn and Saturn is known as the</text>

  <text start="156.33" dur="6.36">refers to the Lord Yahshua HaMashiach as</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="6.27">the god of the covenants now if you look</text>
  <text start="162.69" dur="7.29">here you can see a pattern on the North</text>
  <text start="165.72" dur="6.53">Pole of the planet Saturn that unclear</text>
  <text start="169.98" dur="5.13">here let&amp;#39;s like make it more clear</text>
  <text start="172.25" dur="6.49">that&amp;#39;s a hexagonal pattern and circling</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="5.31">the North Pole and this website says the</text>
  <text start="178.74" dur="3.72">hexagonal pattern and circling the North</text>
  <text start="180.42" dur="4.59">Pole is a symbol for a stronghold or a</text>
  <text start="182.46" dur="5.1">seal as one made with a signet ring</text>
  <text start="185.01" dur="4.38">since six is the number for man the</text>
  <text start="187.56" dur="4.44">hexagonal pattern on the top of the</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="4.26">ringed planet symbolizes Yahshua</text>
  <text start="192" dur="3.41">HaMashiach the god man who made the</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="4.47">covenants and sealed them with the seal</text>
  <text start="195.41" dur="4.48">the hexagonal pattern is also commonly</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="4.26">believed to mark out the points of an</text>
  <text start="199.89" dur="5.22">inscribed Star of David the six-sided</text>
  <text start="202.38" dur="4.95">star is a sign of great blessing the</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="3.99">six-pointed star near the North Pole is</text>
  <text start="207.33" dur="3.6">a sign of ya&amp;#39;s covenants with man</text>
  <text start="209.1" dur="4.14">especially the Adamic and Davidic</text>
  <text start="210.93" dur="4.56">covenant and it is a sign of Yahshua</text>
  <text start="213.24" dur="4.29">HaMashiach as the son of David who will</text>
  <text start="215.49" dur="5.73">rule from the throne of David during the</text>
  <text start="217.53" dur="5.429">Millennium and then you can also look at</text>
  <text start="221.22" dur="4.17">this picture here the northern lights of</text>
  <text start="222.959" dur="4.321">the ringed planet have been detected in</text>
  <text start="225.39" dur="3.569">infrared photographs which are not in</text>

  <text start="237.66" dur="5.25">Lord Yahshua HaMashiach shocked seated</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="4.92">on the Millennial throne of David now</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="4.77">before everyone freaks out and says oh</text>
  <text start="244.95" dur="4.98">but the the Star of David is completely</text>
  <text start="247.68" dur="3.54">pagan yes I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of taking</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="4.77">things that have been associated with</text>
  <text start="251.22" dur="6.63">the Star of David but you know yah</text>
  <text start="254.7" dur="5.7">created this ring the planet that Satan</text>
  <text start="257.85" dur="5.129">is called Saturn and yeah put that</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="4.56">hexagonal pattern on the pole and in</text>
  <text start="262.979" dur="3.211">fact yah has put the Star of David all</text>
  <text start="264.96" dur="4.65">over nature</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="6.3">you can see it here and this beautiful</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="6.48">flower and you can see it here on this</text>
  <text start="272.49" dur="7.13">beautiful flower and here again on this</text>
  <text start="276.09" dur="8.22">beautiful flower and here again</text>
  <text start="279.62" dur="8.23">six-pointed flower so I yeah it may be</text>
  <text start="284.31" dur="6.03">pagan but Satan&amp;#39;s twisted it yeah put it</text>
  <text start="287.85" dur="4.77">in nature well before Satan ever got</text>
  <text start="290.34" dur="8.49">ahold of the Star of David the</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="12.21">six-pointed star now turn to Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="298.83" dur="9.06">chapter 9 and also I want you to look at</text>
  <text start="304.83" dur="5.37">Revelation chapter 7 Revelation chapter</text>
  <text start="307.89" dur="4.13">7 is all about the ceiling of the</text>
  <text start="310.2" dur="5.7">hundred and forty-four thousand an</text>
  <text start="312.02" dur="6.16">Ezekiel 9 is is a similar ceiling that</text>
  <text start="315.9" dur="4.22">occurs that is a foreshadow or a like</text>
  <text start="318.18" dur="6.12">pattern of what happens in Revelation</text>
  <text start="320.12" dur="7.39">chapter 7 starting in verse 1 of Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="4.83">9 he cried also in my years of the loud</text>
  <text start="327.51" dur="4.08">voice saying caused them that have</text>
  <text start="329.13" dur="4.53">charged over the city to draw near even</text>
  <text start="331.59" dur="5.82">every man with his destroying weapon in</text>
  <text start="333.66" dur="6.6">his hand and behold six men case we have</text>
  <text start="337.41" dur="4.77">six six men came from the way of the</text>
  <text start="340.26" dur="4.71">higher gate which lie toward the north</text>
  <text start="342.18" dur="4.65">so we have six men coming from the north</text>
  <text start="344.97" dur="6.72">just like we have that six hexagon on</text>
  <text start="346.83" dur="8.43">the North Pole of this ring planet that</text>
  <text start="351.69" dur="5.729">Satan called Saturn in every man a</text>
  <text start="355.26" dur="4.29">slaughter weapon and Everett and one man</text>
  <text start="357.419" dur="4.681">among them was clothed with linen with a</text>
  <text start="359.55" dur="4.14">writer&amp;#39;s inkhorn by a side and they went</text>
  <text start="362.1" dur="3.27">in and stood beside the brazen altar so</text>
  <text start="363.69" dur="4.53">we have six men that came from the north</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="4.62">gate and one of those six men how does</text>
  <text start="368.22" dur="4.47">it has a writer&amp;#39;s inkhorn by his side</text>
  <text start="369.99" dur="4.65">and the glory of the yob Israel was gone</text>
  <text start="372.69" dur="4.32">up from the cherub whereupon he was to</text>
  <text start="374.64" dur="4.26">the threshold of the house and he called</text>
  <text start="377.01" dur="4.56">the man clothed with linen which had the</text>
  <text start="378.9" dur="4.65">writers inkhorn by a side and Yahweh</text>
  <text start="381.57" dur="3.78">said unto him go through the mist of the</text>
  <text start="383.55" dur="4.29">city through the midst of Jerusalem and</text>
  <text start="385.35" dur="4.59">set a mark upon the foreheads of the men</text>
  <text start="387.84" dur="4.44">that sigh and cry for all the</text>
  <text start="389.94" dur="4.74">abominations that are done the midst</text>
  <text start="392.28" dur="4.44">thereof and to the others he said in my</text>
  <text start="394.68" dur="4.71">hearing go you after him through the</text>
  <text start="396.72" dur="3.23">city and smite let not your eyes spare</text>
  <text start="399.39" dur="2.84">neither</text>
  <text start="399.95" dur="4.02">you pity sleigh udderly old and young</text>
  <text start="402.23" dur="4.59">both maids and little children and women</text>
  <text start="403.97" dur="5.55">but come not near any man upon whom is</text>
  <text start="406.82" dur="4.29">the mark and begin at my sanctuary and</text>
  <text start="409.52" dur="3.27">they began at the ancient man which were</text>
  <text start="411.11" dur="4.2">before the house so we have a picture of</text>
  <text start="412.79" dur="5.61">these six men one of whom has the ink</text>
  <text start="415.31" dur="6.48">horn this guy with the ink horn starts</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="5.52">marking the righteous and then the</text>
  <text start="421.79" dur="4.53">others are smitten and destroyed but but</text>
  <text start="423.92" dur="4.68">the the destroyers are told not to come</text>
  <text start="426.32" dur="4.17">close to those who are who are sealed</text>
  <text start="428.6" dur="4.23">and worked this is exactly what we read</text>
  <text start="430.49" dur="4.32">in Revelation chapter 7 because we read</text>
  <text start="432.83" dur="3.87">starting in verse 2 and I saw another</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="4.47">angel ascending from the east having the</text>
  <text start="436.7" dur="5.1">seal the Living yah and he cry with a</text>
  <text start="439.28" dur="4.23">loud voice to the four angels to whom it</text>
  <text start="441.8" dur="3.96">was given to hurt the earth and the sea</text>
  <text start="443.51" dur="4.08">saying hurt not the earth neither the</text>
  <text start="445.76" dur="4.02">sea nor the trees till we have sealed</text>
  <text start="447.59" dur="4.08">the servants of our yah in their</text>
  <text start="449.78" dur="5.01">foreheads and then we have the ceiling</text>
  <text start="451.67" dur="6.36">of 144,000 now if you flip back to</text>
  <text start="454.79" dur="5.46">Ezekiel if you go on to what happens</text>
  <text start="458.03" dur="4.28">after the ceiling of these men in</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="5.07">Jerusalem you go to Ezekiel chapter 10</text>
  <text start="462.31" dur="5.26">verse 1 it says then I looked and behold</text>
  <text start="465.32" dur="3.96">in the firmament that was above the head</text>
  <text start="467.57" dur="4.53">of the cherubims there appeared over</text>
  <text start="469.28" dur="4.35">them as it were a sapphire stone as the</text>
  <text start="472.1" dur="3.9">appearance of the lightness of a throne</text>
  <text start="473.63" dur="4.59">and he spake unto the man clothed with</text>
  <text start="476" dur="5.07">linen and said go in between the wheels</text>
  <text start="478.22" dur="4.8">even under the cherub and fill your hand</text>
  <text start="481.07" dur="5.22">with coals of fire from between the</text>
  <text start="483.02" dur="5.58">cherubims and scatter them over the city</text>
  <text start="486.29" dur="5.1">and he went in my sight so this guy who</text>
  <text start="488.6" dur="5.49">did the ceiling now is told to scoop up</text>
  <text start="491.39" dur="5.61">these coals of fire from between the</text>
  <text start="494.09" dur="5.97">cherubim now compare that to revelation</text>
  <text start="497" dur="6.51">8 verse 5 this is right after the</text>
  <text start="500.06" dur="5.34">ceiling of 144,000 it says in the angel</text>
  <text start="503.51" dur="4.17">took the censer and filled it with fire</text>
  <text start="505.4" dur="4.5">of the altar and cast it into the earth</text>
  <text start="507.68" dur="4.77">and there were voices and thunderings</text>
  <text start="509.9" dur="4.05">and lightnings an earthquake so we can</text>
  <text start="512.45" dur="4.19">clearly see that there&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="513.95" dur="5.75">pattern between Ezekiel 9 and 10 and</text>
  <text start="516.64" dur="6.25">revelation 7 and 8 at the ceiling of</text>
  <text start="519.7" dur="6.58">144,000 is directly tied to what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="522.89" dur="6.36">on here in Ezekiel 9 and 10 now if you</text>
  <text start="526.28" dur="7.7">continue on reading in Ezekiel chapter</text>

  <text start="534.41" dur="5.5">starting in verse 9 and when I look</text>
  <text start="537.899" dur="4.141">behold the four wheels by the cherubims</text>
  <text start="539.91" dur="4.109">one wheel by one cherub and another</text>
