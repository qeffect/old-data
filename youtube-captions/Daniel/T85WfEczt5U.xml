  <text start="2.82" dur="4.59">youtube&amp;#39;s be recorded on the morning of</text>
  <text start="4.47" dur="5.76">november third 2012 or the 19th day of</text>
  <text start="7.41" dur="6.2">the eighth month my name is daniel john</text>

  <text start="13.61" dur="5.98">torah calm and this is Torah restoration</text>
  <text start="16.619" dur="4.92">ministries a lot of people lately have</text>
  <text start="19.59" dur="4.08">been leaving comments on my youtubes and</text>
  <text start="21.539" dur="3.351">sending me private messages saying that</text>
  <text start="23.67" dur="5.429">I shouldn&amp;#39;t be judging other people</text>
  <text start="24.89" dur="6.219">judge not lest you be judged and I want</text>
  <text start="29.099" dur="3.931">to clear this misconception up using the</text>
  <text start="31.109" dur="3.771">Scriptures because I think there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="33.03" dur="4.52">of confusion regarding the subject</text>
  <text start="34.88" dur="6.97">especially amongst the body of Messiah</text>
  <text start="37.55" dur="7.329">in Matthew chapter 7 verses 1 through 5</text>
  <text start="41.85" dur="4.74">it says very clearly judge not lest you</text>
  <text start="44.879" dur="3.75">be judged and that&amp;#39;s usually the the</text>
  <text start="46.59" dur="4.44">verse that everyone quotes however to</text>
  <text start="48.629" dur="5.371">continue reading if you go to verse 5 it</text>
  <text start="51.03" dur="6.93">says thou hypocrite so it&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="54" dur="6.329">hypocrites not to judge now I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="57.96" dur="4.829">if I have to state the obvious here but</text>
  <text start="60.329" dur="5.251">if you&amp;#39;re a hypocrite you&amp;#39;re not a</text>
  <text start="62.789" dur="4.881">believer okay someone who&amp;#39;s a believer</text>
  <text start="65.58" dur="5.19">is blameless and pure of heart a</text>
  <text start="67.67" dur="4.66">believer loves Yahshua falls heart soul</text>
  <text start="70.77" dur="3.959">mind and strength and loves his neighbor</text>
  <text start="72.33" dur="4.62">as himself he&amp;#39;s not harboring secrets</text>
  <text start="74.729" dur="5.041">and he&amp;#39;s not saying one thing and doing</text>
  <text start="76.95" dur="4.349">another that would be a hypocrite Paul</text>
  <text start="79.77" dur="3.81">talks about this as well in Romans he</text>
  <text start="81.299" dur="3.93">says how are you to judge a man saying</text>
  <text start="83.58" dur="4.74">you know don&amp;#39;t commit adultery when</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="4.651">you&amp;#39;re out there stealing you know if</text>
  <text start="88.32" dur="3.06">you&amp;#39;re committing sin and then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="89.88" dur="4.02">pointing out sin in other people&amp;#39;s lives</text>
  <text start="91.38" dur="6.48">that&amp;#39;s wrong its wickedness and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="93.9" dur="6.42">hypocrisy however there is a correct or</text>
  <text start="97.86" dur="4.799">righteous form of judging and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="100.32" dur="8.52">find that in first Corinthians chapter 2</text>
  <text start="102.659" dur="9.931">verses 15 and 16 in that passage it says</text>
  <text start="108.84" dur="6.569">very clearly a spiritual man judges all</text>
  <text start="112.59" dur="6.059">things but he himself is judged of no</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="7.201">man for who with half the mind of</text>
  <text start="118.649" dur="5.671">Messiah but us you see once you&amp;#39;ve given</text>
  <text start="122.61" dur="4.23">your heart to Yahshua he gives you his</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="4.35">mind you had the mind of Messiah that</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="2.779">doesn&amp;#39;t mean you know everything it</text>
  <text start="128.67" dur="3.88">doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have perfect knowledge</text>
  <text start="129.619" dur="5.541">but it does mean you have a pure heart</text>
  <text start="132.55" dur="4.05">and at that point you are able to judge</text>
  <text start="135.16" dur="4.32">things correctly you&amp;#39;re able to see</text>
  <text start="136.6" dur="6.15">things correctly again if you go to</text>
  <text start="139.48" dur="6.51">first Corinthians 6 1 through 6 Paul</text>
  <text start="142.75" dur="6.96">says no you not that we the Saints shall</text>
  <text start="145.99" dur="7.02">even judge the angels how much more the</text>
  <text start="149.71" dur="7.08">things that pertain to this life think</text>
  <text start="153.01" dur="7.44">about that we&amp;#39;re even going to judge the</text>
  <text start="156.79" dur="6.95">Angels so how much more judging the</text>
  <text start="160.45" dur="5.46">things that pertain to this life</text>
  <text start="163.74" dur="3.97">righteous judgment is actually an</text>
  <text start="165.91" dur="7.26">attribute of love it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="167.71" dur="6.66">opposed to love it&amp;#39;s used often to bring</text>
  <text start="173.17" dur="3">the person that you&amp;#39;re judging to</text>
  <text start="174.37" dur="4.92">repentance to point out their specific</text>
  <text start="176.17" dur="6.9">scent now let me give you some examples</text>
  <text start="179.29" dur="6.15">of wrong types of judging for instance i</text>
  <text start="183.07" dur="4.23">had a person make a comment on a YouTube</text>
  <text start="185.44" dur="3.96">recently that said you know Daniel I</text>
  <text start="187.3" dur="3.81">just think I just get this impression</text>
  <text start="189.4" dur="4.41">from washing your videos that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="191.11" dur="5.1">just filled with bitterness I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="193.81" dur="4.59">that doesn&amp;#39;t cut it see the Ruach</text>
  <text start="196.21" dur="5.55">Hakodesh the holy spirit always convicts</text>
  <text start="198.4" dur="6.33">of specific sin doesn&amp;#39;t convictive of</text>
  <text start="201.76" dur="4.77">vague feelings another woman sent me an</text>
  <text start="204.73" dur="3.06">email and said Daniel I just I think</text>
  <text start="206.53" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;re just filled a bunch of pride and</text>
  <text start="207.79" dur="5.18">anger again that doesn&amp;#39;t cut it you have</text>
  <text start="210.85" dur="5.37">to give specific evidence and specific</text>
  <text start="212.97" dur="4.81">examples of that sin for example this</text>
  <text start="216.22" dur="4.32">person who accuse me of bitterness I</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="4.98">said well that&amp;#39;s not true I&amp;#39;m not bitter</text>
  <text start="220.54" dur="5.13">I&amp;#39;m actually filled with a lot of joy</text>
  <text start="222.76" dur="4.77">and peace from my Heavenly Father so you</text>
  <text start="225.67" dur="4.319">need to repent for bearing false witness</text>
  <text start="227.53" dur="5.07">so you know that&amp;#39;s a specific sin that</text>
  <text start="229.989" dur="3.75">would be a form of righteous judging but</text>
  <text start="232.6" dur="3.09">when you just go around saying well I</text>
  <text start="233.739" dur="3.211">just I just don&amp;#39;t feel like what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.69" dur="4.53">saying is right that that would be</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="4.98">unrighteous judging now a lot of people</text>
  <text start="240.22" dur="5.07">of course will say well Daniel I mean</text>
  <text start="241.93" dur="5.19">come on everyone sins you know we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="245.29" dur="4.41">be pure of heart there&amp;#39;s no way so then</text>
  <text start="247.12" dur="7.31">we shouldn&amp;#39;t judge well that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="249.7" dur="9.599">either read first John 3 6 through 11</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="8.07">read matthew 548 read the scripture in</text>
  <text start="259.299" dur="5.911">the Tanakh where Yahshua Yahweh tells</text>
  <text start="262.5" dur="3.659">Avraham walk before me and be thou</text>
  <text start="265.21" dur="3.929">perfect</text>
  <text start="266.159" dur="5.521">the word perfect in Hebrew is Tammy own</text>
  <text start="269.139" dur="4.59">which means blameless or pure of heart</text>
  <text start="271.68" dur="3.82">again it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you have all</text>
  <text start="273.729" dur="4.321">knowledge it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you have</text>
  <text start="275.5" dur="4.59">a perfect physical body doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="278.05" dur="4.23">your emotions are always perfect what it</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="4.56">does mean is that your heart your heart</text>
  <text start="282.28" dur="5.509">is centered on pleasing your heavenly</text>
  <text start="284.65" dur="7.199">father you just want to put a smile on</text>
  <text start="287.789" dur="5.801">yahshua&amp;#39;s face your heart is to serve</text>
  <text start="291.849" dur="2.85">your neighbor to love your neighbor as</text>
  <text start="293.59" dur="3.9">you love yourself that&amp;#39;s where your</text>
  <text start="294.699" dur="4.861">heart is and so when your heart is like</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="4.44">that then you can see clearly to judge</text>
  <text start="299.56" dur="4.62">others and judging is a very very</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="4.44">important thing to do I mean Yahshua</text>
  <text start="304.18" dur="3.949">said it&amp;#39;s funny in the very same chapter</text>
  <text start="306.37" dur="4.44">he says judge not lest you be judged</text>
  <text start="308.129" dur="4.75">addressing hypocrites he then addresses</text>
  <text start="310.81" dur="5.13">believers and says you can judge a true</text>
  <text start="312.879" dur="4.32">prophet from a false prophet judge you</text>
  <text start="315.94" dur="3.39">know based off the fruits that they bear</text>
  <text start="317.199" dur="4.861">so right there in the very same chapter</text>
  <text start="319.33" dur="6.6">he&amp;#39;s showing how to judge and then also</text>
  <text start="322.06" dur="6.72">in John chapter 7 verse 24 Yahshua says</text>
  <text start="325.93" dur="5.609">do not judge by the appearance but judge</text>
  <text start="328.78" dur="4.56">righteous judgment so again he&amp;#39;s showing</text>
  <text start="331.539" dur="5.521">what the wrong type of judgment is and</text>
  <text start="333.34" dur="5.91">what the right type of judgment is it is</text>
  <text start="337.06" dur="4.469">time to grow up body of Messiah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.25" dur="4.889">time to put away our childish things and</text>
  <text start="341.529" dur="5.851">it&amp;#39;s time to really start obeying the</text>
  <text start="344.139" dur="5.191">word and realizing what I consider and I</text>
  <text start="347.38" dur="5.279">think what y&amp;#39;all would consider a very</text>
  <text start="349.33" dur="7.38">basic doctrine in the Bible which is</text>
  <text start="352.659" dur="6.361">righteous at judging so before you go on</text>
  <text start="356.71" dur="4.019">to other peoples youtubes or go to their</text>
  <text start="359.02" dur="3.57">ministries and say judge not lest ye be</text>
  <text start="360.729" dur="4.201">judged be careful about what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.59" dur="4.71">saying and on the other side if you</text>
  <text start="364.93" dur="3.959">start criticizing other people make sure</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="2.97">you&amp;#39;re doing it in accordance with the</text>
  <text start="368.889" dur="3.601">ruach ha kodesh you&amp;#39;re pointing out a</text>
  <text start="370.27" dur="5.25">specific sin in the hopes of bringing</text>
  <text start="372.49" dur="5.19">that person to repentance if you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="375.52" dur="4.5">doing it because you&amp;#39;re offended that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.68" dur="5.97">not the right motivation at all at the</text>
  <text start="380.02" dur="8.25">end of psalm 119 it says those who love</text>
  <text start="383.65" dur="5.97">the Torah nothing shall offend them so</text>
  <text start="388.27" dur="4.32">you have to make sure that your life is</text>
  <text start="389.62" dur="4.529">clean that your heart is pure that</text>
  <text start="392.59" dur="2.91">you&amp;#39;re truly loving yah with all your</text>
  <text start="394.149" dur="3.45">heart soul mind and strength and your</text>
  <text start="395.5" dur="3.59">loving your neighbors yourself and then</text>
  <text start="397.599" dur="5.011">at that point</text>
  <text start="399.09" dur="4.81">you could start judging now that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="402.61" dur="2.97">mean you just start going out and</text>
  <text start="403.9" dur="4.019">looking for who to judge I don&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="405.58" dur="4.35">either you just live your life you live</text>
  <text start="407.919" dur="5.791">your life and situations naturally come</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="5.28">across also if you&amp;#39;re called to go out</text>
  <text start="413.71" dur="4.23">and do street preaching I&amp;#39;ve done a lot</text>
  <text start="415.21" dur="4.8">of street preaching there&amp;#39;s often</text>
  <text start="417.94" dur="3.15">judging involved in that your warning</text>
  <text start="420.01" dur="3.45">people you&amp;#39;re telling people to turn</text>
  <text start="421.09" dur="4.44">away from their sin the prophets did</text>
  <text start="423.46" dur="4.08">that let&amp;#39;s knock the Apostles did that</text>
  <text start="425.53" dur="3.99">in the book of Acts it&amp;#39;s a regular</text>
  <text start="427.54" dur="4.17">normal thing but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s often looked</text>
  <text start="429.52" dur="3.78">at as distasteful or an abhorrence in</text>
