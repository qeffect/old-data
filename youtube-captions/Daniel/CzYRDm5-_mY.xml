  <text start="106.77" dur="4.139">Israelites were freed from slavery also</text>
  <text start="108.6" dur="4.14">commemorates of course the day thirteen</text>
  <text start="110.909" dur="4.381">hundred years later that Yahshua Jesus</text>
  <text start="112.74" dur="6.629">was crucified he was literally crucified</text>
  <text start="115.29" dur="6.21">on the day of Passover and then of</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="3.871">course he was buried for three days and</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="3.899">three nights and then he resurrected on</text>
  <text start="123.24" dur="4.68">the feast of firstfruits and became the</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="4.021">firstfruits from among the dead so that</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="3.059">happened in late April of course it&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="2.7">Passover and then you got the seven days</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="3.211">of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="3.93">and the events that happened here we had</text>
  <text start="134.19" dur="4.86">the Notre Dame fire breaking out on</text>
  <text start="136.05" dur="5.46">April 15 2009 teen which if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="139.05" dur="5.04">watched and we know who decodes serial</text>
  <text start="141.51" dur="4.589">brain to that was a white hat event to</text>
  <text start="144.09" dur="4.32">try to foil what the black hats were</text>
  <text start="146.099" dur="4.321">attempting to do Attorney General bar</text>
  <text start="148.41" dur="3.99">gives a press conference on the Mueller</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="4.289">report that happened right before</text>
  <text start="152.4" dur="6.089">Passover and then the black hats</text>
  <text start="154.709" dur="8.541">retaliation occurred with the Sri Lanka</text>
  <text start="158.489" dur="7.08">Massacre on that Sunday April 21st 2019</text>
  <text start="163.25" dur="4.54">then you had what&amp;#39;s known as the second</text>
  <text start="165.569" dur="4.801">Passover so in Torah if you are unclean</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="5.34">or if you&amp;#39;re traveling and you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="4.38">able to celebrate the first Passover you</text>
  <text start="173.13" dur="3.48">can actually keep it a month later in</text>
  <text start="174.75" dur="6.09">the second month on the fourteenth day</text>

  <text start="180.84" dur="4.53">Passover is that&amp;#39;s how important to</text>
  <text start="183.45" dur="3.96">observe and celebrate Passover it is</text>
  <text start="185.37" dur="4.35">because without the blood of Yahshua the</text>
  <text start="187.41" dur="3.63">Messiah then you have no foundation so</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="2.37">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s the only Hebrew feast</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="4.02">where you&amp;#39;re allowed to keep it a month</text>
  <text start="192.09" dur="5.25">later if you miss it when it comes in</text>

  <text start="546.64" dur="5.189">and then Joseph puts his own his own</text>
  <text start="549.61" dur="3.87">commentary here&amp;#39;s a thought could the</text>
  <text start="551.829" dur="3.331">mass arrests or big events occur very</text>
  <text start="553.48" dur="4.08">soon as far as the Jewish holidays</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="4.169">coming up doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily have to</text>
  <text start="557.56" dur="3.779">fall on the holiday could be a few days</text>
  <text start="559.329" dur="5.671">before or after could the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="561.339" dur="5.401">calendar be a guide to yah telling us it</text>
  <text start="565" dur="3.779">seems interesting that the corruptor</text>
  <text start="566.74" dur="5.67">running nervous right now and increases</text>
  <text start="568.779" dur="5.221">right around the Jewish holidays and so</text>
  <text start="572.41" dur="5.34">as he knows it doesn&amp;#39;t have to happen</text>
  <text start="574" dur="5.04">you know on necessarily right on the</text>
  <text start="577.75" dur="3.36">date can happen in a couple days before</text>
  <text start="579.04" dur="5.12">after but but anyway I thought Joseph</text>
  <text start="581.11" dur="7.14">did a really really good job of showing</text>
  <text start="584.16" dur="7.21">how at least so far in the calendar year</text>
  <text start="588.25" dur="6.27">2019 how these Hebrew Jewish feast days</text>
  <text start="591.37" dur="6.57">have correlated with major political and</text>
