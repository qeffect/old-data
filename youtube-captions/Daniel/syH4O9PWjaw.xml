  <text start="7.14" dur="4.77">unleavened bread which is also a high</text>
  <text start="9.66" dur="4.62">Sabbath a high Shabbat that means that</text>
  <text start="11.91" dur="4.11">no matter what day of the week this day</text>
  <text start="14.28" dur="3.98">would happen to fall in during the year</text>
  <text start="16.02" dur="4.65">it would be considered a Sabbath day</text>
  <text start="18.26" dur="4.06">there are two high Sabbath during</text>
  <text start="20.67" dur="3.75">Passover week the first day of</text>
  <text start="22.32" dur="4.41">unleavened bread which is the day right</text>
  <text start="24.42" dur="4.98">after Passover that kicks off the seven</text>
  <text start="26.73" dur="5.279">days of eating no leaven of only having</text>
  <text start="29.4" dur="4.05">unleavened bread and then the seventh</text>
  <text start="32.009" dur="4.441">day of unleavened bread is a high</text>
  <text start="33.45" dur="5.91">Sabbath as you can see I have a picture</text>
  <text start="36.45" dur="4.44">here of the walls of Jericho tumbling</text>
  <text start="39.36" dur="4.98">down as the children of Israel march</text>
  <text start="40.89" dur="6.12">around Jericho seven times to shout out</text>
  <text start="44.34" dur="4.8">on those as the seven trumpets blow on</text>
  <text start="47.01" dur="3.45">the seventh time on the seventh day of</text>
  <text start="49.14" dur="3.27">unleavened bread now</text>
  <text start="50.46" dur="3.57">scripture doesn&amp;#39;t come out and say</text>
  <text start="52.41" dur="3.18">directly that this is the seventh day of</text>
  <text start="54.03" dur="3.959">unleavened bread but there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="55.59" dur="5.07">strong clues if you read the scriptures</text>
  <text start="57.989" dur="4.381">in the book of Joshua you&amp;#39;ll find that</text>
  <text start="60.66" dur="3.27">they celebrated the first Passover in</text>
  <text start="62.37" dur="3.99">the promised land right after they</text>
  <text start="63.93" dur="4.68">crossed the Jordan the Joshua had been</text>
  <text start="66.36" dur="4.2">commanded by Yahweh to circumcise all</text>
  <text start="68.61" dur="3">the children of Israel because everyone</text>
  <text start="70.56" dur="2.58">that had been twenty years and younger</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="3.09">who had survived their parents and</text>
  <text start="73.14" dur="3.93">emerged from the wilderness after 40</text>
  <text start="74.7" dur="3.75">years they have not been circumcised in</text>
  <text start="77.07" dur="3.27">the wilderness so they were all</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="3.66">circumcised so that they could partake</text>
  <text start="80.34" dur="4.2">of the Passover land and actually keep</text>
  <text start="82.11" dur="4.68">Passover so it says that they across the</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="4.05">Jordan there were circumcised they took</text>
  <text start="86.79" dur="3.48">a couple days for them to heal from the</text>
  <text start="88.59" dur="3.209">circumcision and then they kept the</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="3.27">Passover right there on the banks of</text>
  <text start="91.799" dur="3.601">Jordan this is just right before they go</text>
  <text start="93.54" dur="3.09">up to Jericho and then the very next</text>
  <text start="95.4" dur="2.73">thing we read after they keep the</text>
  <text start="96.63" dur="3.93">Passover at the banks of the Jordan and</text>
  <text start="98.13" dur="4.349">the manna stops for the first time in 40</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="4.5">years because now they&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="4.441">Promised Land we read about how Yahweh</text>
  <text start="105.06" dur="4.589">commands Joshua and the children of</text>
  <text start="106.92" dur="5.489">Israel to march around Jericho for seven</text>
  <text start="109.649" dur="4.351">days and the march once around Jericho</text>
  <text start="112.409" dur="2.971">for seven days and the people will not</text>
  <text start="114" dur="3.24">say a thing it&amp;#39;s just the priests will</text>
  <text start="115.38" dur="3.93">blow their seven horns but then on the</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="3.93">seventh day of their marching their to</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="3.78">marched around the town not once but</text>
  <text start="121.17" dur="3.39">seven times and then when those seven</text>
  <text start="123.09" dur="3.239">trumpets blow from the priests all the</text>
  <text start="124.56" dur="3.3">people shout and then the walls of</text>
  <text start="126.329" dur="3.3">Jericho will come tumbling down and</text>
  <text start="127.86" dur="3.3">that&amp;#39;s exactly what happens so</text>
  <text start="129.629" dur="3.181">throughout the seven days of unleavened</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="3.09">bread right everybody keep the Passover</text>
  <text start="132.81" dur="3.36">they follow yah</text>
  <text start="134.25" dur="4.5">with instructions they march around the</text>
  <text start="136.17" dur="4.41">town of Jericho and then of course on</text>
  <text start="138.75" dur="3.74">the seventh day which I believe is the</text>
  <text start="140.58" dur="4.98">seventh day of unleavened bread today</text>
  <text start="142.49" dur="4.6">they of course follow what Yahweh tells</text>
  <text start="145.56" dur="3.93">them to do and the walls come tumbling</text>
  <text start="147.09" dur="5.91">down and Israel is able to easily defeat</text>
  <text start="149.49" dur="6.33">one of the more powerful cities of the</text>
  <text start="153" dur="7.59">ancient days and of course this victory</text>
  <text start="155.82" dur="7.56">causes a resounding it&amp;#39;s heard all</text>
  <text start="160.59" dur="5.04">throughout the land of Canaan and so</text>
  <text start="163.38" dur="3.84">many of the nations are very much put</text>
  <text start="165.63" dur="5.04">into fear after they hear how easily</text>
  <text start="167.22" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re able to conquer Jericho so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="170.67" dur="3.18">the seventh day of unleavened bread it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.14" dur="3.66">a day of victory you know we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="173.85" dur="3.81">kind of in the season of victory for the</text>
  <text start="175.8" dur="4.38">last several months because we started</text>
  <text start="177.66" dur="5.16">off with Chanukah of course which is all</text>
  <text start="180.18" dur="4.83">about victory how the Maccabees had this</text>
  <text start="182.82" dur="4.68">overwhelming victory against the Greek</text>
  <text start="185.01" dur="4.59">Empire against impossible odds and then</text>
  <text start="187.5" dur="4.11">a couple months later we had Purim which</text>
  <text start="189.6" dur="4.62">is of course the story of Esther and all</text>
  <text start="191.61" dur="4.86">this evil turning into good and a major</text>
  <text start="194.22" dur="4.95">victory for the for the Jewish people</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="5.82">because Esther obeyed Yahweh and obeyed</text>
  <text start="199.17" dur="4.289">her uncle and now we come to the seventh</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="3.06">day of unleavened bread which is a</text>
  <text start="203.459" dur="3.271">resounding victory for the children of</text>
  <text start="205.35" dur="3.69">Israel these walls come tumbling down</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="5.94">and they&amp;#39;re able to just take this this</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="6.78">very powerful City by simply praising</text>
  <text start="212.67" dur="7.86">and shouting - yeah so it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="215.82" dur="7.919">awesome day - to celebrate Passover as a</text>
  <text start="220.53" dur="5.07">whole is more of a sober feast you know</text>
  <text start="223.739" dur="4.321">in the fall we have Sukkot which is very</text>
  <text start="225.6" dur="4.41">joyous and celebratory and and but</text>
  <text start="228.06" dur="3.989">Passover is a very sober feast up or</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="4.5">even commanded to eat it in haste with</text>
  <text start="232.049" dur="5.041">sobriety remembering some very serious</text>
  <text start="234.51" dur="4.59">things such as the Passover night and</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="4.41">the angel passed over and the firstborn</text>
  <text start="239.1" dur="4.62">in Egypt were dead and there was a great</text>
  <text start="241.5" dur="4.14">wailing that went up from Egypt the</text>
  <text start="243.72" dur="5.16">crossing of the Red Seal the danger that</text>
  <text start="245.64" dur="6.06">happened with Pharaoh chasing Israel and</text>
  <text start="248.88" dur="4.23">then of course you know the the things</text>
  <text start="251.7" dur="4.8">that happened to Yahshua when he came</text>
  <text start="253.11" dur="5.04">2,000 years ago when he was sacrificed</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s the sacrificial lamb on the day of</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="3.72">Passover and laid into a tomb for three</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="4.26">days three nights and then of course</text>
  <text start="261.87" dur="4.74">rose again our first fruits but by the</text>
  <text start="265.08" dur="2.25">seventh day of unleavened bread we do</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="3">have</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="4.769">because we have this commemoration of</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="3.6">the walls of Jericho tumbling down by</text>
  <text start="272.099" dur="2.85">the seventh day of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="273.21" dur="3.449">Yahshua had at this point already</text>
  <text start="274.949" dur="3.9">appeared not only to the women at the</text>
  <text start="276.659" dur="4.26">tomb but he&amp;#39;d appeared to the disciples</text>
  <text start="278.849" dur="3.63">most of the disciples at this point and</text>
  <text start="280.919" dur="4.411">so by the seventh day of unleavened</text>
  <text start="282.479" dur="5.25">bread the disciples knew that Joshua had</text>
  <text start="285.33" dur="3.41">risen that he was alive that everything</text>
  <text start="287.729" dur="3.541">was going to be okay</text>
  <text start="288.74" dur="5.41">so the seventh day of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="291.27" dur="5.399">is a great time of celebration as I</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="4.59">noted in a previous video a couple of</text>
  <text start="296.669" dur="4.831">days ago as Passover was just beginning</text>
  <text start="298.74" dur="3.959">this year is unique as we know the seven</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="2.759">days of unleavened bread including</text>
  <text start="302.699" dur="4.981">Passover always happened on a different</text>
  <text start="304.259" dur="5.101">time every year every sometime in late</text>
  <text start="307.68" dur="3.93">March early April it always happens but</text>
  <text start="309.36" dur="4.17">depending on the moon when the new moon</text>
  <text start="311.61" dur="4.35">occurs it can happen in a different</text>
  <text start="313.53" dur="3.81">timeframe and this year it&amp;#39;s unique</text>
  <text start="315.96" dur="2.699">because we have the seven days of</text>
  <text start="317.34" dur="4.62">unleavened bread that kicked off last</text>
  <text start="318.659" dur="5.37">Sabbath last Saturday and today is the</text>
  <text start="321.96" dur="3.329">seventh day it&amp;#39;s a Friday but tonight of</text>
  <text start="324.029" dur="2.79">course when the seven days of unleavened</text>
  <text start="325.289" dur="3.93">bread and you&amp;#39;d usually be able to go</text>
  <text start="326.819" dur="4.59">out and buy 11 or 11 or cook something</text>
  <text start="329.219" dur="4.35">with leaven in it you won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="331.409" dur="4.531">because it&amp;#39;ll be the Sabbath day and so</text>
  <text start="333.569" dur="4.861">our feast of unleavened bread is sort of</text>
  <text start="335.94" dur="4.14">as it were extended an extra day because</text>
  <text start="338.43" dur="3.209">we&amp;#39;re not able to go out and buy yeast</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="4.589">or cook with yeast because it&amp;#39;ll be the</text>
  <text start="341.639" dur="5.64">regular weekly Sabbath so Yahweh is kind</text>
  <text start="344.669" dur="4.5">of orchestrated things this year on the</text>
  <text start="347.279" dur="4.17">calendar to force us to have eight days</text>
  <text start="349.169" dur="3.691">of unleavened bread rather than seven</text>
  <text start="351.449" dur="4.68">days of unleavened bread tacking on that</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="4.89">extra day the weekly Sabbath and of</text>
  <text start="356.129" dur="5.16">course the number eight is symbolic for</text>
  <text start="357.75" dur="4.169">new beginning if you count the day of</text>
  <text start="361.289" dur="2.521">Passover</text>
  <text start="361.919" dur="3.661">that&amp;#39;s at the very beginning that</text>
  <text start="363.81" dur="5.849">happened last Friday you have nine days</text>
  <text start="365.58" dur="5.13">total of all of this feasting and so and</text>
  <text start="369.659" dur="3">I talked about the prophetic</text>
  <text start="370.71" dur="3.75">significance in the other video about</text>
  <text start="372.659" dur="3.48">how yasser emphasizing the need to be</text>
  <text start="374.46" dur="3.69">pure and holy like that what that</text>
  <text start="376.139" dur="3.601">unleavened bread symbolizes because of</text>
  <text start="378.15" dur="4.5">the things that are happening in the</text>
  <text start="379.74" dur="5.519">world so I would encourage everyone to</text>
  <text start="382.65" dur="4.769">take this this upcoming Sabbath very</text>
  <text start="385.259" dur="4.171">seriously because I do think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="387.419" dur="5.101">message from you I think it&amp;#39;s a time to</text>
  <text start="389.43" dur="5.639">really reflect I think I&amp;#39;m personally</text>
  <text start="392.52" dur="5.16">going to probably fast for this upcoming</text>
  <text start="395.069" dur="4.961">Sabbath a day of fasting</text>
  <text start="397.68" dur="3.79">because I you know usually on Fridays</text>
  <text start="400.03" dur="3.57">they usually go out and I buy my food</text>
  <text start="401.47" dur="3">and prepare for Shabbat but I can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="403.6" dur="2.88">that today because it&amp;#39;s the highest</text>
  <text start="404.47" dur="3.78">habit I can&amp;#39;t go and buy groceries so I</text>
  <text start="406.48" dur="4.62">think I&amp;#39;m gonna choose - maybe fast</text>
  <text start="408.25" dur="4.59">tomorrow for the Sabbath day for some</text>
  <text start="411.1" dur="4.68">things that are going on in my life and</text>
  <text start="412.84" dur="5.4">it might be something that you might</text>
  <text start="415.78" dur="4.02">consider to do as well maybe you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="418.24" dur="3.03">have anything going on source in your</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="3.48">life that you need to fast and see gone</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="3.12">but you know just the fact that we are</text>
  <text start="423.28" dur="2.67">having this extra day of unleavened</text>
  <text start="424.39" dur="4.14">bread it might be a time for extra</text>
