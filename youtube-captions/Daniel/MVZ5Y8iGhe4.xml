  <text start="0" dur="4.859">shabbat shalom this is daniel john lee</text>
  <text start="2.429" dur="4.95">with torah restoration ministries it is</text>
  <text start="4.859" dur="6.03">the Sabbath day the weekly Shabbat and</text>
  <text start="7.379" dur="7.441">the 24th Shabbat since the shemitah year</text>
  <text start="10.889" dur="9.14">began back in early April 24th Shabbat</text>
  <text start="14.82" dur="8.76">on the Friday night September the 16th</text>
  <text start="20.029" dur="6.851">2016 we&amp;#39;re only now a little more than</text>
  <text start="23.58" dur="5.43">two weeks away from yom teruah the feast</text>
  <text start="26.88" dur="4.979">of trumpets and I just wanted to spend</text>
  <text start="29.01" dur="4.709">just a real brief time tonight going</text>
  <text start="31.859" dur="5.22">over an email that I gotten through the</text>
  <text start="33.719" dur="5.641">web about a lady asking about what is</text>
  <text start="37.079" dur="4.651">the proper way or the appropriate way to</text>
  <text start="39.36" dur="5.19">celebrate Shabbat and I thought it might</text>
  <text start="41.73" dur="4.649">be better just to kind of respond excuse</text>
  <text start="44.55" dur="4.32">me what is the appropriate way to</text>
  <text start="46.379" dur="4.381">celebrate yom teruah the Feast of</text>
  <text start="48.87" dur="5.579">Trumpets which again is coming up in</text>
  <text start="50.76" dur="7.2">about two weeks which I thought would be</text>
  <text start="54.449" dur="5.821">better to respond publicly so for the</text>
  <text start="57.96" dur="7.32">benefit of everyone rather than just to</text>
  <text start="60.27" dur="6.63">her privately so she asked a bunch of</text>
  <text start="65.28" dur="4.769">questions because she&amp;#39;d never kept yum</text>
  <text start="66.9" dur="5.25">tore the Feast of Trumpets before one</text>
  <text start="70.049" dur="4.561">thing that&amp;#39;s interesting about the feast</text>
  <text start="72.15" dur="4.38">days if you go to like Leviticus 23 and</text>
  <text start="74.61" dur="4.77">you read about the the seven annual</text>
  <text start="76.53" dur="4.35">feast days of course there are some</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="3.629">definite things you do on each of the</text>
  <text start="80.88" dur="5.19">feast days but a lot of times the</text>
  <text start="83.009" dur="5.941">details are left up to us and how we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="86.07" dur="4.979">going to celebrate a feast now obviously</text>
  <text start="88.95" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s something like Passover I mean we</text>
  <text start="91.049" dur="4.311">have some prescribed things that we need</text>
  <text start="92.46" dur="6.089">to do the lamb the bitter herbs the</text>
  <text start="95.36" dur="6.25">unleavened bread but in the case of like</text>
  <text start="98.549" dur="6.061">yom teruah basically it says that it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="101.61" dur="5.88">time to blow trumpets to make a blasting</text>
  <text start="104.61" dur="4.68">of trumpets or shofars and it&amp;#39;s a holy</text>
  <text start="107.49" dur="3.6">convocation of course that word</text>
  <text start="109.29" dur="4.789">convocation using the King James just</text>
  <text start="111.09" dur="5.58">means a gathering I gathering together</text>
  <text start="114.079" dur="6.04">that&amp;#39;s probably the most important thing</text>
  <text start="116.67" dur="5.97">for all of these feasts including and</text>
  <text start="120.119" dur="6">especially yom teruah that then the fall</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="8.009">feasts gathering together with other</text>
  <text start="126.119" dur="6.301">people and if you don&amp;#39;t have people to</text>
  <text start="130.649" dur="3.661">fellowship with then you need to ask God</text>
  <text start="132.42" dur="4.289">to provide that for you</text>
  <text start="134.31" dur="4.259">because these feasts are meant to be</text>
  <text start="136.709" dur="4.911">kept with other people and you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="138.569" dur="5.911">supposed to be a lone ranger they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="141.62" dur="5.11">designed to be to joining with other</text>
  <text start="144.48" dur="4.11">people face-to-face okay not on the</text>
  <text start="146.73" dur="3.78">internet but like face-to-face gathering</text>
  <text start="148.59" dur="4.41">with other like-minded people for these</text>
  <text start="150.51" dur="4.65">feasts that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the original</text>
  <text start="153" dur="4.739">intention and so I would say for yom</text>
  <text start="155.16" dur="4.56">teruah the best thing to do is to gather</text>
  <text start="157.739" dur="4.681">together with others who love yacht and</text>
  <text start="159.72" dur="4.14">get yourself your shofar or trumpets or</text>
  <text start="162.42" dur="3.78">hopefully someone within the gathering</text>
  <text start="163.86" dur="5.879">has a shofar and start blasting it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.2" dur="8.009">a day of praise and worship and singing</text>
  <text start="169.739" dur="7.051">it&amp;#39;s a feast day and so you know food</text>
  <text start="174.209" dur="4.681">and celebration and it&amp;#39;s of course most</text>
  <text start="176.79" dur="5.4">importantly yom teruah is all pointing</text>
  <text start="178.89" dur="6.69">toward that last great trumpet that is</text>
  <text start="182.19" dur="6.18">blown in which we get caught up to be</text>
  <text start="185.58" dur="6.18">with Yahshua in the air the dead rise</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="5.19">first and then we who are alive and</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="3.839">remain are caught up to do with him</text>
  <text start="193.56" dur="4.679">forever in the air as its talked about</text>
  <text start="195.599" dur="5.491">in first Thessalonians 4 1st Corinthians</text>
  <text start="198.239" dur="5.911">15 revelation 10 and 11 it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="5.91">seventh and last trumpet that&amp;#39;s blown</text>
  <text start="204.15" dur="4.35">and it&amp;#39;s when we get caught up to be</text>
  <text start="207" dur="4.079">with Yahshua and we&amp;#39;re with him forever</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="4.38">ism it&amp;#39;s in my view it&amp;#39;s like the best</text>
  <text start="211.079" dur="3.03">feast everything it&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="212.88" dur="4.05">next thing that we&amp;#39;re looking forward</text>
  <text start="214.109" dur="4.141">you know Shabbat was fulfilled 2,000</text>
  <text start="216.93" dur="4.74">years ago and now we&amp;#39;ve been in this</text>
  <text start="218.25" dur="5.91">long prophetic summer and we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="221.67" dur="4.23">fast and quickly toward some yom teruah</text>
  <text start="224.16" dur="5.01">some future yom teruah in which we get</text>
  <text start="225.9" dur="6.69">caught up to be with Yahshua toward the</text>
  <text start="229.17" dur="4.56">end of the Great Tribulation but I again</text>
  <text start="232.59" dur="2.549">I think the most important thing because</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="2.879">she was asking like well what do we do</text>
  <text start="235.139" dur="2.731">do you know what do I need to do I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="236.609" dur="3.061">even know how to play trumpets or</text>
  <text start="237.87" dur="3.81">whatever can I just play a CD of</text>
  <text start="239.67" dur="3.569">trumpets which that&amp;#39;s fine playing a CD</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="4.02">or music of trumpets is fine if you</text>
  <text start="243.239" dur="4.921">don&amp;#39;t have a shofar but I think again</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="4.92">the most important thing is is to be</text>
  <text start="248.16" dur="5.01">joining with other people other people</text>
  <text start="250.62" dur="4.23">in fact maybe I should have mentioned</text>
  <text start="253.17" dur="2.76">Shabbat as well it&amp;#39;s very important on</text>
  <text start="254.85" dur="4.47">the weekly shabbat they&amp;#39;re joined</text>
  <text start="255.93" dur="5.459">together with other people as well and I</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="3.69">you know I hear people say well I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="261.389" dur="4.111">really have any fellowship I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="263.01" dur="5.04">where to go to get on your face and ask</text>
  <text start="265.5" dur="4.289">you how to provide it because we have to</text>
  <text start="268.05" dur="5.25">have fellowship that&amp;#39;s what keeps us</text>
  <text start="269.789" dur="6.211">accountable it keeps us from from</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="4.56">getting caught up in the wiles of the</text>
  <text start="276" dur="3.78">enemy we can&amp;#39;t just sit behind our</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="3.69">computers and you know just have a</text>
  <text start="279.78" dur="3.42">personal relationship with God and not</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="4.23">have a relation with other people and so</text>
  <text start="283.2" dur="5.76">well no one&amp;#39;s like minded yes there are</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="4.74">like-minded people his body is cast all</text>
  <text start="288.96" dur="2.91">over the earth and if you&amp;#39;re part of his</text>
  <text start="290.52" dur="4.38">body i was going to provide you with</text>
  <text start="291.87" dur="4.169">people to fellowship with so i would say</text>
  <text start="294.9" dur="3.65">the most important thing is to find</text>
  <text start="296.039" dur="5.731">people that you can gather together with</text>
  <text start="298.55" dur="6.19">bring food have those trumpets those</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="4.769">shofars blow them up and meditate on all</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="5.34">the different scriptures throughout the</text>
  <text start="306.539" dur="5.971">word that point toward that day at the</text>
  <text start="310.08" dur="5.22">last trumpet blowing in which were</text>
  <text start="312.51" dur="4.62">caught up to be with Yahshua but but you</text>
  <text start="315.3" dur="3.419">know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s interesting how on all of</text>

  <text start="325.409" dur="4.26">important and it&amp;#39;s of course emphasized</text>
  <text start="328.349" dur="3.721">again all the way through the Brit</text>

  <text start="341.789" dur="5.521">just wanted to leave that with everyone</text>
