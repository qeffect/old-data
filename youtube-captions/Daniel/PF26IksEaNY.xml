  <text start="509.95" dur="4.5">freeways of Los Angeles toward UCLA I</text>
  <text start="512.38" dur="4.17">was very nervous because I never</text>
  <text start="514.45" dur="3.56">preached on a campus outside of Portland</text>
  <text start="516.55" dur="3.35">alone before</text>
  <text start="518.01" dur="4.83">but as I listened to a worship song on</text>
