  <text start="5.009" dur="4.951">the eleventh month the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="7.28" dur="7.05">fellowship and we&amp;#39;re now going to go on</text>
  <text start="9.96" dur="7.319">to e bruise chapter 12 we just finished</text>
  <text start="14.33" dur="5.859">what faith is complete and total</text>
  <text start="17.279" dur="5.431">surrender to yah and keeping his word</text>
  <text start="20.189" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s what faith is is obeying him</text>
  <text start="22.71" dur="4.05">trusting him enough to obey Him and we</text>
  <text start="25.199" dur="4.711">saw examples of that over and over again</text>
  <text start="26.76" dur="6.12">throughout Hebrews chapter 11 and so now</text>
  <text start="29.91" dur="4.95">in Hebrews 12 wherefore seeing we also</text>
  <text start="32.88" dur="5.31">our compass about with so great a cloud</text>
  <text start="34.86" dur="5.699">of witnesses let us lay aside every</text>
  <text start="38.19" dur="4.86">weight and the sin which does so easily</text>
  <text start="40.559" dur="5.791">beset us and let us run with patience</text>
  <text start="43.05" dur="5.31">the race that is set before us will fall</text>
  <text start="46.35" dur="3.57">or the author of Hebrews is encouraging</text>
  <text start="48.36" dur="5.28">us to run with patience just like we</text>
  <text start="49.92" dur="5.4">have constant admonitions to endure to</text>
  <text start="53.64" dur="3.18">the end that&amp;#39;s what Yasha was saying and</text>
  <text start="55.32" dur="3.27">then of course we know that the promise</text>
  <text start="56.82" dur="6.239">to fill the elf in Revelation chapter 3</text>
  <text start="58.59" dur="7.349">is to have the patience and faith of the</text>
  <text start="63.059" dur="4.92">saints which is endurance to go to the</text>
  <text start="65.939" dur="5.43">end to keep on going don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t allow</text>
  <text start="67.979" dur="5.041">sin to pesetas but to run our race to</text>
  <text start="71.369" dur="3.18">set our eyes on the prize which of</text>
  <text start="73.02" dur="5.279">course is Yahshua as Paul says in</text>
  <text start="74.549" dur="6.39">Philippians chapter 3 verse 2 looking</text>
  <text start="78.299" dur="4.831">unto Yahshua Alleluia the author and</text>
  <text start="80.939" dur="3.511">finisher of our faith this is almost</text>
  <text start="83.13" dur="4.05">verbatim of what Paul says in</text>
  <text start="84.45" dur="4.47">Philippians 3 so this is again showing</text>
  <text start="87.18" dur="4.29">more and more that Paul wrote this</text>
  <text start="88.92" dur="5.22">letter looking at the Yahshua the author</text>
  <text start="91.47" dur="4.71">and finisher of our faith the beginning</text>
  <text start="94.14" dur="4.17">in the end that&amp;#39;s so cool the author</text>
  <text start="96.18" dur="4.53">which is like the beginning of it and in</text>
  <text start="98.31" dur="4.8">the finisher of it who for the joy that</text>
  <text start="100.71" dur="5.79">was set before him endured the cross</text>
  <text start="103.11" dur="5.52">despising the shame and is set down at</text>
  <text start="106.5" dur="3.93">the right hand of the throne of yah so</text>
  <text start="108.63" dur="3.629">Yahshua doesn&amp;#39;t ask us to go through</text>
  <text start="110.43" dur="4.29">anything that he himself didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="112.259" dur="4.261">through and then some because none of us</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="3.689">have had to go through the crucifixion</text>
  <text start="116.52" dur="4.86">of the of the cross and yet he did that</text>
  <text start="118.409" dur="5.441">and he didn&amp;#39;t allow that shame and that</text>
  <text start="121.38" dur="4.779">pain and all that he went through</text>
  <text start="123.85" dur="4.62">doing that on Passover night to</text>
  <text start="126.159" dur="4.231">discourage him instead he despised that</text>
  <text start="128.47" dur="3.93">shame and he said his focus on what was</text>
  <text start="130.39" dur="5.46">going to come beyond that which was the</text>
  <text start="132.4" dur="5.07">crown being elevated hallelujah and</text>
  <text start="135.85" dur="3.359">that&amp;#39;s what we should set our eyes on we</text>
  <text start="137.47" dur="3.599">should set our eyes on Yahshua who went</text>
  <text start="139.209" dur="5.241">before us and went through much more</text>
  <text start="141.069" dur="5.311">worse than what we&amp;#39;ve had to endure</text>
  <text start="144.45" dur="3.369">realizing that these afflictions and</text>
  <text start="146.38" dur="2.939">tribulations we go through which are</text>
  <text start="147.819" dur="3.301">nothing compared to the afflictions of</text>
  <text start="149.319" dur="4.381">tribulations that yasho and through are</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="5.82">simply to bring us closer to Yahshua</text>
  <text start="153.7" dur="4.8">hallelujah for considering him that</text>
  <text start="156.94" dur="3.93">endured such contradiction of sinners</text>
  <text start="158.5" dur="5.25">against himself lest you be wearied and</text>
  <text start="160.87" dur="5.28">faint in your minds you have not he have</text>
  <text start="163.75" dur="5.04">not yet resisted on the blood striving</text>
  <text start="166.15" dur="4.02">against sin so he shall look look at</text>
  <text start="168.79" dur="2.94">what yasho went through he went through</text>
  <text start="170.17" dur="6.569">way more than anything you&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="171.73" dur="6.87">through and basically you know what</text>
  <text start="176.739" dur="4.591">Yahshua did is he resisted sin even</text>
  <text start="178.6" dur="4.109">under the shedding of blood he strove</text>
  <text start="181.33" dur="4.26">against sin even into the shedding of</text>
  <text start="182.709" dur="7.141">blood even unto his own mutilation and</text>
  <text start="185.59" dur="7.679">destruction on the cross so really we</text>
  <text start="189.85" dur="4.74">have no excuse and that&amp;#39;s the type of</text>
  <text start="193.269" dur="4.291">heart we need to have we would rather</text>
  <text start="194.59" dur="4.59">die than sin we should want to strive</text>
  <text start="197.56" dur="6.12">against sin to the point of shedding our</text>
  <text start="199.18" dur="6.39">own blood hallelujah and by keeping our</text>
  <text start="203.68" dur="5.97">eyes on what Yahshua did and how much</text>
  <text start="205.57" dur="5.91">worse what he went through this keeps us</text>
  <text start="209.65" dur="3.57">from becoming weary or fainting in our</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="3.3">minds and we start thinking oh man look</text>
  <text start="213.22" dur="2.7">at this circumstance I&amp;#39;m going for a</text>
  <text start="214.78" dur="2.79">look through this trial and going</text>
  <text start="215.92" dur="3.72">through or this tribulation we&amp;#39;ll all we</text>
  <text start="217.57" dur="3.33">have to do is remember what Yasha went</text>
  <text start="219.64" dur="3.719">through and all of a sudden we realize</text>
  <text start="220.9" dur="3.839">whoa our circumstances are nothing the</text>
  <text start="223.359" dur="3.331">tribulations and trials were going</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="4.861">through are nothing compared to what</text>
  <text start="226.69" dur="4.109">Yahshua had to endure so he can</text>
  <text start="229.6" dur="2.85">certainly help us through his spirit</text>
  <text start="230.799" dur="5.331">endure whatever we need to do in door</text>
  <text start="232.45" dur="6.06">right now in our present circumstances</text>
  <text start="236.13" dur="4.06">verse 5 and you have forgotten the</text>
  <text start="238.51" dur="4.08">exhortation which speaks into you as in</text>
  <text start="240.19" dur="5.22">the children my son despise not thou the</text>
  <text start="242.59" dur="5.31">chasing of Yahweh nor faint will now</text>

  <text start="250.09" dur="4.46">he</text>
  <text start="251.25" dur="5.01">receives so when we get chastised by</text>
  <text start="254.55" dur="4.29">Yahshua when we&amp;#39;re going through various</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="4.77">tribulations or trials or corrections in</text>
  <text start="258.84" dur="3.239">our life we shouldn&amp;#39;t be all upset or</text>
  <text start="261.03" dur="3.06">complaining about it we should actually</text>
  <text start="262.079" dur="4.171">be rejoicing because this is just a</text>
  <text start="264.09" dur="4.49">proof that Yahweh loves us if he just</text>
  <text start="266.25" dur="4.77">allowed us to skip merrily on in our sin</text>
  <text start="268.58" dur="5.35">you know then that would be proof that</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="4.62">were not as children but when he rebukes</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="4.29">us when he chastises us when he puts us</text>
  <text start="275.64" dur="4.5">through trials and tribulations to bring</text>
  <text start="278.22" dur="3.12">us closer to him that&amp;#39;s evidence</text>

  <text start="295.47" dur="3.96">be without chastisement aware of all are</text>
  <text start="297.48" dur="5.46">partakers then are you bastards and not</text>

  <text start="306.39" dur="5.19">not in during any afflictions or</text>
  <text start="309.3" dur="3.99">tribulations or whatnot then we should</text>
  <text start="311.58" dur="4.38">be questioning whether we&amp;#39;re really</text>
