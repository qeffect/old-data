  <text start="204.09" dur="4.44">instance we got the helmet of salvation</text>
  <text start="205.519" dur="4.811">this is our head covering and I have</text>
  <text start="208.53" dur="3.81">articles on my website and podcasts that</text>
  <text start="210.33" dur="3.629">prove that both men and women should</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="3">wear a head covering of a hundred</text>
  <text start="213.959" dur="3.78">percent material whether it&amp;#39;s linen</text>
  <text start="215.34" dur="3.42">cotton what have you I like linen</text>

  <text start="230.19" dur="3.84">tell you as a personal testimony that</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="3.48">when I started wearing the head covering</text>
  <text start="234.03" dur="2.58">you know for many years I did not wear</text>
  <text start="235.86" dur="2.55">the head covering because I</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="2.82">misunderstood first Corinthians 11 I</text>
  <text start="238.41" dur="3.389">thought men weren&amp;#39;t supposed to cover</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="3.69">their heads but forever since I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="241.799" dur="3">obedient and understood this it is</text>
  <text start="243.12" dur="3.179">protected my thought life it&amp;#39;s helped my</text>
  <text start="244.799" dur="2.731">thoughts have greater clarity especially</text>
  <text start="246.299" dur="4.44">when I&amp;#39;m under the anointing preaching</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="5.79">and whatnot it&amp;#39;s truly as a helmet of</text>
  <text start="250.739" dur="4.261">salvation okay it&amp;#39;s and for women as</text>
  <text start="253.32" dur="4.05">well women they literally have power of</text>
  <text start="255" dur="4.29">the angels / 1st Corinthians 11 they can</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="3.149">rebuke the fallen angels and it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="259.29" dur="3.3">mess with them because remember Eve was</text>
  <text start="260.519" dur="3.871">deceived and so women have this</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="4.06">proclivity to be easily deceived but</text>
  <text start="264.39" dur="3.88">when they put on that veil it</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="4.59">it gives them clarity of thought gives</text>
  <text start="268.27" dur="4.649">the more authority helps them so this</text>
  <text start="271.24" dur="3.36">Delmas salvation then we go down to the</text>

  <text start="286.66" dur="4.17">heart we guard our hearts like job when</text>
  <text start="289.27" dur="3.75">he made a covenant with his eyes that he</text>
  <text start="290.83" dur="3.69">would not look at any evil thing we</text>
  <text start="293.02" dur="3.09">guard our hearts my minds we don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="294.52" dur="3.72">get into everything that we think that</text>

  <text start="298.24" dur="6.03">this book of enoch the targum the talmud</text>
  <text start="302.38" dur="3.509">all this trash and stuff no we stick</text>
  <text start="304.27" dur="4.74">with the bible we stick with the spirit</text>
  <text start="305.889" dur="4.53">with that simplicity in christ and you</text>

  <text start="310.419" dur="4.801">but make sure the movie is not foul you</text>
  <text start="313.18" dur="3.15">know that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s wholesome and things</text>
  <text start="315.22" dur="2.97">like that and the books we read in</text>
  <text start="316.33" dur="3.149">things like that so especially when we</text>

  <text start="319.479" dur="3.66">guides us on the internet so that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="320.919" dur="5.25">only going to pull some places that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.139" dur="4.681">the breastplate of righteousness then we</text>
  <text start="326.169" dur="3.93">had the shield of faith now the shield</text>
  <text start="327.82" dur="4.71">of faith is total and complete surrender</text>
  <text start="330.099" dur="4.981">to yah remember Yahshua said in Matthew</text>
  <text start="332.53" dur="5.49">23 23 that faith is one of the major</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="4.41">pillars of Torah the Torah of Moses</text>
  <text start="338.02" dur="5.16">faith because you have to have faith</text>
  <text start="339.49" dur="5.73">Abraham had faith in young and then he</text>
  <text start="343.18" dur="5.04">got circumcised so it&amp;#39;s faith that</text>
  <text start="345.22" dur="5.55">teaches us and enables us to then obey</text>
  <text start="348.22" dur="4.35">the tour of Moses okay faith if that</text>
  <text start="350.77" dur="3.209">works is dead so the shield of faith is</text>
  <text start="352.57" dur="4.319">absolutely necessary to quench those</text>
  <text start="353.979" dur="4.44">fiery darts when we keep the Torah Moses</text>
  <text start="356.889" dur="4.731">it&amp;#39;s proof that we have true faith and</text>
  <text start="358.419" dur="5.401">yah and as we&amp;#39;re growing in the Torah</text>
  <text start="361.62" dur="4.18">then we have the sort of the spirit the</text>
  <text start="363.82" dur="3.3">word of yah okay we got to be meditating</text>
  <text start="365.8" dur="3.51">on his word day and night just like</text>
  <text start="367.12" dur="4.44">David talks about in psalm 119 we got to</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="4.26">know the Torah inside and out you know</text>
  <text start="371.56" dur="3.329">Yahshua even as a young boy at 12 he</text>
  <text start="373.57" dur="3.599">knew that Torah because the Jewish</text>
  <text start="374.889" dur="3.991">culture was you would meditate and learn</text>
  <text start="377.169" dur="3.661">on these Torah scrolls even from a young</text>
  <text start="378.88" dur="3.06">age and that&amp;#39;s how it was even though</text>
  <text start="380.83" dur="2.43">they didn&amp;#39;t have Bibles scattered</text>
  <text start="381.94" dur="2.82">everywhere even in ancient Israel they</text>
  <text start="383.26" dur="3.12">saw these Torah scrolls and synagogues</text>
  <text start="384.76" dur="3.21">and people would memorize and meditate</text>
  <text start="386.38" dur="3.3">that&amp;#39;s what we need to be doing and that</text>
  <text start="387.97" dur="3.569">way we have the sword to fight the enemy</text>
  <text start="389.68" dur="3.12">to fight off the enemy it&amp;#39;s not flesh</text>
  <text start="391.539" dur="2.91">and blood we&amp;#39;re fighting against it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.8" dur="3.39">the spiritual powers of darkness and</text>
