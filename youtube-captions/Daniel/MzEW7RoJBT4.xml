  <text start="0.56" dur="6.67">Shalom this is the third and final part</text>
  <text start="3.659" dur="6.36">to the irrefutable proof that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="7.23" dur="5.909">that Jesus rose from the dead that he</text>
  <text start="10.019" dur="6.901">rose from the grave so in the last two</text>
  <text start="13.139" dur="5.521">parts I very clearly showed that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="16.92" dur="4.38">plenty of evidence plenty of proof that</text>
  <text start="18.66" dur="5.369">Yahshua did indeed rise from the grave</text>
  <text start="21.3" dur="5.28">in the early first century and the</text>
  <text start="24.029" dur="5.041">alternative really I mean if you want to</text>
  <text start="26.58" dur="5.31">reject the idea that Yahshua rose from</text>
  <text start="29.07" dur="5.82">the dead you&amp;#39;d have to propose something</text>
  <text start="31.89" dur="5.97">like you know the Jews stole the body or</text>
  <text start="34.89" dur="4.47">the disciples hallucinate &amp;#39;add and and</text>
  <text start="37.86" dur="4.23">you know somehow you know there was just</text>
  <text start="39.36" dur="4.59">all all invented and made up which again</text>
  <text start="42.09" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;ve shown in the last two videos that</text>
  <text start="43.95" dur="4.17">those theories those ideas make</text>
  <text start="45.69" dur="6.689">absolutely no sense when you examine the</text>
  <text start="48.12" dur="6.63">facts and when you use logic now some</text>
  <text start="52.379" dur="5.761">people will say well you know what those</text>
  <text start="54.75" dur="5.039">those New Testament documents they were</text>
  <text start="58.14" dur="3.57">not even written in the first century</text>
  <text start="59.789" dur="3.511">this was just some story that was</text>
  <text start="61.71" dur="4.47">written several hundred years after the</text>
  <text start="63.3" dur="5.7">fact and it was invented but that is not</text>
  <text start="66.18" dur="5.04">true either and I&amp;#39;m gonna clearly</text>
  <text start="69" dur="5.58">demonstrate why that cannot possibly be</text>
  <text start="71.22" dur="5.1">true if you look at the Gospels and if</text>
  <text start="74.58" dur="4.679">you read the book of Acts there is</text>
  <text start="76.32" dur="6.33">absolutely no mention within those</text>
  <text start="79.259" dur="6.061">documents of Jerusalem and the Temple</text>
  <text start="82.65" dur="5.52">being destroyed in 70 AD there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="85.32" dur="5.79">mention whatsoever now this is very</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="5.1">curious because according to those very</text>
  <text start="91.11" dur="6">documents according to the Gospels Jesus</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="5.459">predicted that event Yahshua predicted</text>
  <text start="97.11" dur="3.81">and prophesied that Jerusalem was going</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="4.201">to be destroyed but not one stone would</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="3.809">be left upon the other that the temple</text>
  <text start="102.93" dur="3.63">was going to be torn down so you would</text>
  <text start="104.729" dur="4.111">think that if these people are trying to</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="3.599">give credibility to the person they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="108.84" dur="3.36">writing about to Yahshua they would have</text>
  <text start="110.159" dur="5.221">put that in there but they didn&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="112.2" dur="6.3">that in there and why because these</text>
  <text start="115.38" dur="5.4">documents were written before Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="118.5" dur="6.6">was destroyed before the temple was torn</text>
  <text start="120.78" dur="7.289">down therefore these documents had to</text>
  <text start="125.1" dur="5.18">have been written before 70 AD and that</text>
  <text start="128.069" dur="4.701">is just a very very clear evidence that</text>
  <text start="130.28" dur="5.37">these Gospels were written in the four</text>
  <text start="132.77" dur="5.78">century also they discovered a piece of</text>
  <text start="135.65" dur="6.12">paper I parchment of the book of John in</text>
  <text start="138.55" dur="5.89">Egypt that is dated it is dated by</text>
  <text start="141.77" dur="6.17">secular archaeologists people who do not</text>
  <text start="144.44" dur="6.18">believe in the Bible is dated to 135 ad</text>
  <text start="147.94" dur="6.73">now for it to have gotten all the way to</text>
  <text start="150.62" dur="6.72">Egypt by 135 ad it had to have been</text>
  <text start="154.67" dur="4.32">written prior to that so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="157.34" dur="3.66">absolutely no question that these</text>
  <text start="158.99" dur="5.28">documents were written in the early</text>
  <text start="161" dur="5.88">first century so since we know since we</text>
  <text start="164.27" dur="4.86">have proof that these texts the Gospels</text>
  <text start="166.88" dur="4.59">in the book of Acts were written in the</text>
  <text start="169.13" dur="5.16">early first century where we come back</text>
  <text start="171.47" dur="5.16">to the original quandary and that is how</text>
  <text start="174.29" dur="4.4">do you explain the empty tomb how do you</text>
  <text start="176.63" dur="6.33">explain that these men these disciples</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="6.55">saw Yahshua after he had been crucified</text>
  <text start="182.96" dur="5.64">after he&amp;#39;d been publicly executed and</text>
  <text start="185.24" dur="5.37">put in a tomb the disciples could not</text>
  <text start="188.6" dur="4.47">have possibly stolen the body in a</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="4.68">previous videos I examined how their</text>
  <text start="193.07" dur="3.69">motives they didn&amp;#39;t have a motive to do</text>
  <text start="195.29" dur="4.23">so but I&amp;#39;m going to also now talk about</text>
  <text start="196.76" dur="5.67">the practicality if you study ancient</text>
  <text start="199.52" dur="5.28">roman culture you&amp;#39;ll discover that in a</text>
  <text start="202.43" dur="4.05">situation like this where Yasha was put</text>
  <text start="204.8" dur="5.28">into a tomb there was of course a heavy</text>
  <text start="206.48" dur="6.06">rock a stone that wait several tons that</text>
  <text start="210.08" dur="4.44">would be put in front of the tomb it</text>
  <text start="212.54" dur="5.07">would take several strong men to move it</text>
  <text start="214.52" dur="7.62">and there was a Roman Praetorian a guard</text>
  <text start="217.61" dur="8.73">put around this tomb and the penalty for</text>
  <text start="222.14" dur="6">a Roman guard to be slackin his duty in</text>
  <text start="226.34" dur="3.51">other words if someone were to break</text>
  <text start="228.14" dur="3.78">into the tomb the penalty for a Roman</text>
  <text start="229.85" dur="4.74">guard to allowing that to happen would</text>
  <text start="231.92" dur="4.86">be death so the Roman guards posted</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="4.83">around this tomb would have a high</text>
  <text start="236.78" dur="5.07">incentive not to allow anyone to steal</text>
  <text start="239.42" dur="4.08">the body the disciples had just been</text>
  <text start="241.85" dur="3.99">scattered and disheartened they&amp;#39;d just</text>
  <text start="243.5" dur="3.66">seen their master killed and slaughtered</text>
  <text start="245.84" dur="4.74">and they didn&amp;#39;t understand what was</text>
  <text start="247.16" dur="5.01">going on they were in no mind frame to</text>
  <text start="250.58" dur="3.86">work a heist where they had would have</text>
  <text start="252.17" dur="6.27">to move a several ton rock and somehow</text>
  <text start="254.44" dur="5.919">overcome armed Roman soldiers that if</text>
  <text start="258.44" dur="3.33">those Roman soldiers failed in their</text>
  <text start="260.359" dur="3.901">duty to guard the tomb they would be</text>
  <text start="261.77" dur="4.65">killed so just the practicality of the</text>
  <text start="264.26" dur="5.1">whole situation so as the disciples</text>
  <text start="266.42" dur="6.3">of pulled off stealing the body and of</text>
  <text start="269.36" dur="5.7">course the Jews the the Jewish leaders</text>
  <text start="272.72" dur="5.07">and the Roman leaders they had a vested</text>
  <text start="275.06" dur="4.44">interest in not allowing this new</text>
  <text start="277.79" dur="4.86">religion to spread they did not want it</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="5.79">to spread so again all they would have</text>
  <text start="282.65" dur="4.46">had to do is produce the dead body right</text>
  <text start="285.29" dur="4.71">there in the streets of Jerusalem and</text>
  <text start="287.11" dur="6.55">this movement would have been killed</text>
  <text start="290" dur="5.7">immediately these men they were</text>
  <text start="293.66" dur="7.8">persecuted they were tortured they were</text>
  <text start="295.7" dur="8.88">killed why because they believed that</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="5.97">Yahshua had risen from the dead they</text>
  <text start="304.58" dur="5.58">knew it to be true you can&amp;#39;t explain</text>
  <text start="307.43" dur="5.85">that with a hallucination again Paul the</text>
  <text start="310.16" dur="5.4">Apostle was against the religion he was</text>
  <text start="313.28" dur="5.01">actively persecuting these people and</text>
  <text start="315.56" dur="4.82">yet he saw the risen Yahshua after</text>
  <text start="318.29" dur="4.77">Joshua died he saw the risen Yahshua</text>
  <text start="320.38" dur="4.66">okay that can&amp;#39;t be a hallucination even</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="3.48">psychologist today will say that when</text>
  <text start="325.04" dur="2.79">someone has an elucidation there has to</text>
  <text start="326.54" dur="5.24">be something within their mind that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="327.83" dur="7.08">already sort of in their subconscious to</text>
  <text start="331.78" dur="4.6">get them to see this but Paul I mean he</text>
  <text start="334.91" dur="3.33">was completely against his religion why</text>
  <text start="336.38" dur="5.25">would he have an elucidation that would</text>
  <text start="338.24" dur="6.06">impel him to then turn 180 degrees and</text>
  <text start="341.63" dur="4.77">now start supporting the very religion</text>
  <text start="344.3" dur="4.95">he was trying to destroy that makes no</text>
  <text start="346.4" dur="5.73">sense so there is clear clear evidence</text>
  <text start="349.25" dur="5.46">here very clear proof that Yahshua did</text>
  <text start="352.13" dur="5.04">rise from the grave if you&amp;#39;re an atheist</text>
  <text start="354.71" dur="4.8">if you&amp;#39;re an agnostic if you&amp;#39;re a pagan</text>
  <text start="357.17" dur="4.86">if you&amp;#39;re just an unbeliever or skeptic</text>
  <text start="359.51" dur="4.53">there is no excuse for you there is</text>
  <text start="362.03" dur="4.8">plenty of evidence and you don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="364.04" dur="3.99">have to take these three videos for</text>
  <text start="366.83" dur="3.6">proof you can go on the internet</text>
  <text start="368.03" dur="4.32">yourself and verify these claims and see</text>
  <text start="370.43" dur="3.84">all the massive amount of evidence out</text>
  <text start="372.35" dur="4.65">there that Yahshua rose from the grave</text>
  <text start="374.27" dur="5.79">and of course since Yahshua did rise</text>
  <text start="377" dur="4.77">from the grave you had the duty to read</text>
  <text start="380.06" dur="4.02">about him to find out who he is in the</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="4.98">scriptures and to turn away from your</text>
  <text start="384.08" dur="4.59">wickedness apply his blood to your life</text>
  <text start="386.75" dur="4.34">so that you can be forgiven be filled</text>
  <text start="388.67" dur="5.13">with his spirit baptized in water and</text>
  <text start="391.09" dur="6.04">start keeping his Commandments the Torah</text>
  <text start="393.8" dur="5.34">his precious instructions that bring</text>
  <text start="397.13" dur="3.3">life bring blessing and help us to</text>
  <text start="399.14" dur="3.87">glorify Him that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="400.43" dur="5.22">life is all about glorifying Yahshua</text>
  <text start="403.01" dur="6.39">HaMashiach and that&amp;#39;s what we need to be</text>
  <text start="405.65" dur="5.85">doing so there&amp;#39;s no excuse we&amp;#39;re</text>
