  <text start="59.609" dur="5.37">8 hour bet it&amp;#39;s very likely that the</text>
  <text start="62.129" dur="4.861">1335 days the 1290 days that are</text>
  <text start="64.979" dur="4.111">described in Daniel and the 1260 days</text>
  <text start="66.99" dur="4.26">that are described in Revelation all fit</text>

  <text start="74.4" dur="4.079">that way but I can&amp;#39;t say let&amp;#39;s say yeah</text>
  <text start="76.47" dur="3.689">all I can do is share with you what I</text>
  <text start="78.479" dur="5.25">believe y&amp;#39;all showing me so here we go</text>
  <text start="80.159" dur="5.57">I&amp;#39;m gonna try to record this whiteboard</text>
  <text start="83.729" dur="4.53">as good as I can</text>
  <text start="85.729" dur="5.441">already the best I can to try to record</text>
  <text start="88.259" dur="6.301">this as best I can so here we go so</text>
  <text start="91.17" dur="4.8">basically what we have here is right now</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="2.79">we&amp;#39;re in the Jubilee year and of course</text>
  <text start="95.97" dur="4.17">the Jubilee here started last spring</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="4.589">because according to Exodus the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="100.14" dur="4.29">year begins in Aviv which always happens</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="4.441">in March April so begin last spring and</text>
  <text start="104.43" dur="4.649">the Jubilee year will end this upcoming</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="5.34">spring but before we get to that point I</text>
  <text start="109.079" dur="4.051">want to show a few things here so I try</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="3.81">to get this so that it&amp;#39;s showing the</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="3.69">white board as good as possible and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="115.53" dur="7.34">gonna try to make this as clear as</text>
  <text start="116.82" dur="10.76">possible so basically what we have here</text>
  <text start="122.87" dur="10.32">this thing&amp;#39;s not working well they think</text>
  <text start="127.58" dur="11.28">like what we have here is this is 2018</text>
  <text start="133.19" dur="7.74">now I&amp;#39;m gonna put the secular dates and</text>
  <text start="138.86" dur="3.78">then I&amp;#39;ll correlate it with the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="140.93" dur="5.79">dates so let&amp;#39;s just say this is January</text>
  <text start="142.64" dur="7.17">of 2018 this is February here we have</text>
  <text start="146.72" dur="5.37">March and here we have a vote okay</text>
  <text start="149.81" dur="4.89">and then May will put right here okay so</text>
  <text start="152.09" dur="4.26">now right now we&amp;#39;re in the eighth Hebrew</text>
  <text start="154.7" dur="3.87">month right and we&amp;#39;re in October end of</text>
  <text start="156.35" dur="3.57">October going in November by the time we</text>
  <text start="158.57" dur="3.48">get to January February we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="159.92" dur="4.8">in the 11th to 12th Hebrew month okay</text>
  <text start="162.05" dur="6.63">and in fact Purim this next year is</text>
  <text start="164.72" dur="6.27">gonna be on March 2nd and 3rd it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="168.68" dur="3.51">Friday and Saturday and those if you go</text>
  <text start="170.99" dur="3.21">to the book of Esther you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="4.95">the 14th of fifteenth day of Adar or the</text>
  <text start="174.2" dur="4.35">12th month so by the time we get to</text>
  <text start="177.14" dur="4.85">early March we&amp;#39;re gonna be in the middle</text>
  <text start="178.55" dur="5.58">half of the 12th Hebrew month okay now</text>
  <text start="181.99" dur="4.78">because the end of that 12th month</text>
  <text start="184.13" dur="5.579">happens on March 17th that New Moon</text>
  <text start="186.77" dur="4.32">happens like right around March 17th the</text>
  <text start="189.709" dur="2.791">Barley&amp;#39;s not going to be a vivre I mean</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="2.91">there&amp;#39;ll be pockets that will be a V but</text>
  <text start="192.5" dur="3">the barley won&amp;#39;t be a vivre and also you</text>
  <text start="194" dur="3.09">have to wait for the first new moon</text>
  <text start="195.5" dur="3.69">after the spring equinox because in</text>
  <text start="197.09" dur="3.57">Genesis it says you have to use the Sun</text>
  <text start="199.19" dur="4.769">the moon and the stars to determine the</text>
  <text start="200.66" dur="5.04">new year so you use the Stars the Sun by</text>
  <text start="203.959" dur="3.991">using the equinoxes use the moon by the</text>
  <text start="205.7" dur="3.78">new moon conjunction so you always wait</text>
  <text start="207.95" dur="3.33">for the first new moon after conjunction</text>
  <text start="209.48" dur="3.36">the first new moon of conjunction after</text>
  <text start="211.28" dur="2.82">the equinox and March 17th can be too</text>
  <text start="212.84" dur="2.33">early so you got to add in another month</text>
  <text start="214.1" dur="3.84">a 13th month</text>
  <text start="215.17" dur="4.12">well the Hallel calendar and maybe even</text>
  <text start="217.94" dur="2.64">the Karaites are not going to do that</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;re gonna actually start early</text>
  <text start="220.58" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re gonna have a their base is gonna</text>
  <text start="222.08" dur="3.93">start their feast days a month too early</text>
  <text start="224.33" dur="2.909">and they&amp;#39;re gonna have a counterfeit</text>
  <text start="226.01" dur="4.08">feast days that are going to be too</text>
  <text start="227.239" dur="6">early and that&amp;#39;s gonna play into how</text>
  <text start="230.09" dur="5.399">this is all gonna play out now if if my</text>
  <text start="233.239" dur="3.931">theory is correct and Purim which</text>
  <text start="235.489" dur="3.871">happens on March 2nd 30th this is when</text>
  <text start="237.17" dur="3.96">the abomination of desolation occurs and</text>
  <text start="239.36" dur="3.39">see my last video to find out why I</text>
  <text start="241.13" dur="4.109">think the abomination of desolation</text>
  <text start="242.75" dur="5.07">happens or at least when Satan gets</text>
  <text start="245.239" dur="5.03">thrown down and fills the man of sin if</text>
  <text start="247.82" dur="5.039">it occurs on this day then watch this</text>
  <text start="250.269" dur="4.391">we&amp;#39;re gonna have a 13th month right and</text>
  <text start="252.859" dur="3.001">on the tenth day of that thirteenth</text>
  <text start="254.66" dur="4.29">month</text>
  <text start="255.86" dur="4.98">which is when the Jews will keep their</text>
  <text start="258.95" dur="3.18">lamb day now they&amp;#39;re not supposed to</text>
  <text start="260.84" dur="2.61">keep lamb day there we&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="262.13" dur="3.63">wait another month until the tenth day</text>
  <text start="263.45" dur="3.24">but there are on the Hallel counter so</text>
  <text start="265.76" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;ll be keeping the feast days a</text>
  <text start="266.69" dur="3.66">month too early this next year well if</text>
  <text start="269" dur="4.25">you go to the tenth day the thirteenth</text>
  <text start="270.35" dur="6.03">month that day that counterfeit</text>
  <text start="273.25" dur="4.96">counterfeit lamb day if you will it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="276.38" dur="6.32">exactly twelve hundred and ninety days</text>
  <text start="278.21" dur="6.96">from that day to the Feast of Trumpets</text>
  <text start="282.7" dur="5.71">2021 which is exactly three and a half</text>
  <text start="285.17" dur="5.58">years later okay 1290 days from the</text>
  <text start="288.41" dur="4.41">counterfeit lamb day til the Feast of</text>
  <text start="290.75" dur="5.4">Trumpets 2021 now if you go to the real</text>
  <text start="292.82" dur="4.35">lamb day in April the real lamb day when</text>
  <text start="296.15" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re supposed to have it on the tenth</text>
  <text start="297.17" dur="7.19">day of the first month that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="8.1">1260 days 1260 to the Feast of Trumpets</text>
  <text start="304.36" dur="5.32">of 2021 three and a half years later now</text>
  <text start="308.15" dur="4.02">check this out if you go to the book of</text>
  <text start="309.68" dur="5.07">zechariah zechariah receives olives as a</text>
  <text start="312.17" dur="5.28">revelation on the 24th day of the</text>

  <text start="321.86" dur="5.85">day of the eleventh Hebrew month well</text>
  <text start="325.94" dur="3.57">guess what this particular year because</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="3">we have an 8 hour bet if you count from</text>
  <text start="329.51" dur="3.72">the 24th day of the eleventh month</text>
  <text start="330.71" dur="4.89">February 10th 2018 all the way to Feast</text>

  <text start="341.27" dur="5.37">1290 of the 1260 so they all fit now</text>
  <text start="345.32" dur="3.78">what are what&amp;#39;s gonna happen on these</text>
  <text start="346.64" dur="4.89">dates any anyone&amp;#39;s guess but what I what</text>
  <text start="349.1" dur="5.37">I speculate is Satan will be cast down</text>
  <text start="351.53" dur="4.92">around perm I mean again if this is the</text>
  <text start="354.47" dur="3.42">year Satan will be cast in around perm</text>
  <text start="356.45" dur="4.68">and it will manifest physically in some</text>
  <text start="357.89" dur="5.58">sort of huge nuclear war what not by a</text>
  <text start="361.13" dur="4.08">couple weeks later in late March when</text>
  <text start="363.47" dur="3.81">you have the counterfeit land day that</text>
  <text start="365.21" dur="3.959">will be when he basically fills the man</text>
  <text start="367.28" dur="4.08">of sin and he comes as a lamb but speaks</text>
  <text start="369.169" dur="4.591">as a dragon basically he he takes his</text>
  <text start="371.36" dur="4.05">throne at that point and he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="373.76" dur="3.659">start chasing the woman and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="375.41" dur="3.81">be chased from that point all the way</text>
  <text start="377.419" dur="4.111">until a lamb Day in April the real lamb</text>
  <text start="379.22" dur="6.15">day and so the woman will be chased by</text>
  <text start="381.53" dur="6.82">the dragon for that month-long period by</text>
  <text start="385.37" dur="6.05">lamb day in April</text>
  <text start="388.35" dur="7.96">the two witnesses will begin their 1260</text>
  <text start="391.42" dur="6.63">day preaching and the woman the</text>
  <text start="396.31" dur="2.97">Philadelphian Christians one seventh of</text>
  <text start="398.05" dur="3.72">all believers on earth will be in the</text>
  <text start="399.28" dur="4.35">safe place during that period and the</text>
  <text start="401.77" dur="3.66">dragon will have started his five-month</text>
  <text start="403.63" dur="3.54">you know if you&amp;#39;re the fifth trumpet it</text>
  <text start="405.43" dur="3.84">takes some five months to consolidate</text>
  <text start="407.17" dur="4.5">his power so for five months he&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="409.27" dur="5.04">consolidating his global rule and he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="411.67" dur="4.47">begin persecuting those believers who</text>
  <text start="414.31" dur="4.83">did not get into the safe place in</text>
  <text start="416.14" dur="4.47">Revelation 12 and basically from that</text>
  <text start="419.14" dur="3.93">point and for the next three and a half</text>
  <text start="420.61" dur="3.99">years he&amp;#39;s gonna be murdering anyone who</text>
  <text start="423.07" dur="3.78">does not bow their knee to him and take</text>
  <text start="424.6" dur="3.78">the mark of the beast so at that point</text>
  <text start="426.85" dur="2.94">if you&amp;#39;re not in the safe place the only</text>
  <text start="428.38" dur="3.75">way to get salvation is either to be</text>
  <text start="429.79" dur="3.6">martyred or to somehow hide away</text>
  <text start="432.13" dur="2.28">although it&amp;#39;s gonna be very difficult if</text>
  <text start="433.39" dur="2.91">you&amp;#39;re not in the safe place so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="434.41" dur="3.24">probably gonna be martyred and the</text>
  <text start="436.3" dur="3.6">dragon is going to murder millions upon</text>
  <text start="437.65" dur="4.83">millions of people so I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="439.9" dur="3.9">probably the order of events now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.48" dur="3.57">gonna happen on February 10th this</text>
  <text start="443.8" dur="3.9">happens before anything else I mean this</text>
  <text start="446.05" dur="4.29">is when Zechariah received all these</text>
  <text start="447.7" dur="3.84">visions about basically the end of the</text>
  <text start="450.34" dur="3.06">world the Great Tribulation the two</text>
  <text start="451.54" dur="3.3">witnesses all these things I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="4.47">maybe February 10th will be sort of like</text>
  <text start="454.84" dur="5.79">a time marker I know right now we&amp;#39;re way</text>
  <text start="457.87" dur="4.47">in October right and we&amp;#39;re in the eighth</text>
  <text start="460.63" dur="4.8">month which is new beginnings</text>
  <text start="462.34" dur="5.34">and Yahshua said in the Gospels he said</text>
  <text start="465.43" dur="4.26">say not four more months and I&amp;#39;m the</text>
  <text start="467.68" dur="4.29">harvest I tell you the fields are white</text>
  <text start="469.69" dur="4.35">for harvest now well there&amp;#39;s about four</text>
  <text start="471.97" dur="4.02">months right now four months now from</text>
  <text start="474.04" dur="3.36">October where we&amp;#39;re at late October</text>
  <text start="475.99" dur="4.47">until Purim</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="4.68">so we&amp;#39;re not supposed to wait until four</text>
  <text start="480.46" dur="4.47">more months we need to be evangelizing</text>
  <text start="482.08" dur="4.2">now because if if the abomination of</text>
  <text start="484.93" dur="3.93">desolation is going to begin just as</text>
  <text start="486.28" dur="4.29">this Jubilee year is ending then we only</text>
  <text start="488.86" dur="3.24">have four more months and then the night</text>
  <text start="490.57" dur="2.73">will fall in which no man will work in</text>
  <text start="492.1" dur="2.37">fact the only people that will be</text>
  <text start="493.3" dur="3.63">evangelizing during the Great</text>
  <text start="494.47" dur="4.11">Tribulation will be the martyrs who get</text>
  <text start="496.93" dur="3.48">killed and of course the two witnesses</text>
  <text start="498.58" dur="5.28">who also eventually get slaughtered in</text>
  <text start="500.41" dur="5.1">the streets of Jerusalem so if you are a</text>
  <text start="503.86" dur="3.45">Philadelphian if you&amp;#39;re someone who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="505.51" dur="4.11">taking hold that promise in Luke 21 and</text>
  <text start="507.31" dur="4.23">revelation three about being that woman</text>

  <text start="511.54" dur="5.189">have four months to reach the lost and</text>
  <text start="514.24" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s our whole mindset right we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="516.729" dur="3.601">supposed to be trying to win the lost</text>
  <text start="517.96" dur="3.6">now again I&amp;#39;m not saying that&amp;#39;s a view</text>
  <text start="520.33" dur="2.28">I&amp;#39;m not saying the three and</text>

  <text start="588.01" dur="4.32">does happen it&amp;#39;ll be on some future year</text>
  <text start="590.14" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;ll be an eight-hour bet like I said</text>
  <text start="592.33" dur="3.5">if you look over the past seven years an</text>
  <text start="593.74" dur="5.49">eight-hour bet only happened in 2010 and</text>
  <text start="595.83" dur="4.87">2013 so and and now we&amp;#39;re coming up to</text>
  <text start="599.23" dur="3.87">the next one in 2018 so it only only</text>
  <text start="600.7" dur="4.139">happens every three to five years but I</text>

  <text start="604.839" dur="3.331">Tribulation does begin it will start on</text>
  <text start="606.82" dur="3.09">an eight hour bet it has to because</text>
