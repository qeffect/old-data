  <text start="96.93" dur="4.39">why would Disney be involved the money</text>
  <text start="99.759" dur="4.081">the day I know months ago I saved a</text>
  <text start="101.32" dur="4.32">screenshot of a Disney charter jet that</text>
  <text start="103.84" dur="4.709">was flying out of a very small airfield</text>

  <text start="124.719" dur="2.461">suspicious</text>
  <text start="125.409" dur="4.141">other than yeah and trust on me this was</text>
  <text start="127.18" dur="4.53">something to remember so I did then this</text>

  <text start="167.53" dur="3.69">nothing but felt that needed sharing</text>
  <text start="168.97" dur="4.32">this just seemed too coincidental and I</text>
