  <text start="259.529" dur="3.151">of chef whoa so this piece is directly</text>
  <text start="262.019" dur="1.74">connected</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="4.44">because Jeff would actually have an</text>
  <text start="263.759" dur="5.101">article about that on the website so the</text>
  <text start="267.12" dur="3.329">feast of firstfruits unlike the first</text>
  <text start="268.86" dur="4.02">day of unleavened bread and unlike the</text>
  <text start="270.449" dur="4.111">seventh day of unleavened bread the</text>
  <text start="272.88" dur="4.289">piece of firstfruits is not a Sabbath</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="5.609">it&amp;#39;s not a high Sabbath you you can work</text>
  <text start="277.169" dur="5.691">on this day it&amp;#39;s a workday and yet the</text>
  <text start="280.169" dur="5.791">visa firstfruits is very significant now</text>
  <text start="282.86" dur="5.05">most people Christians are ignorant Lee</text>
  <text start="285.96" dur="3.48">celebrating Easter Sunday which of</text>
  <text start="287.91" dur="3.979">course Easter comes from Ishtar it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.44" dur="5.55">pagan it has nothing to do with Yahshua</text>
  <text start="291.889" dur="6.071">resurrecting from the grave but today</text>
  <text start="294.99" dur="4.98">really in actual fact biblically is not</text>
  <text start="297.96" dur="4.41">Easter Sunday or even resurrection</text>
  <text start="299.97" dur="5.31">sunday it is the feast of firstfruits</text>
  <text start="302.37" dur="4.34">it&amp;#39;s the Ascension firstfruits if you</text>
  <text start="305.28" dur="5.22">want to really get technical about it</text>
  <text start="306.71" dur="6.519">because when Yahshua was crucified he</text>
  <text start="310.5" dur="5.25">was crucified on a Wednesday he was laid</text>
  <text start="313.229" dur="4.051">in the tomb Wednesday at twilight before</text>
  <text start="315.75" dur="4.169">the high Sabbath began the first day of</text>
  <text start="317.28" dur="4.109">unleavened bread and he was in the grave</text>
  <text start="319.919" dur="3.541">for three days and three nights so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="321.389" dur="3.81">in the grave on Wednesday night Thursday</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="3.269">night Friday night and he was in the</text>
  <text start="325.199" dur="2.671">grave all day Thursday which would have</text>
  <text start="326.729" dur="4.171">been the first day of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="327.87" dur="4.829">all day Friday and all day Saturday</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="2.94">three days and three nights but he</text>
  <text start="332.699" dur="2.19">couldn&amp;#39;t have been in there Saturday</text>
  <text start="333.84" dur="2.49">night because that would have been more</text>
  <text start="334.889" dur="3.991">than three days and three nights so he</text>
  <text start="336.33" dur="4.49">must have risen on Twilight Saturday so</text>
  <text start="338.88" dur="4.14">it was actually resurrection Shabbat</text>
  <text start="340.82" dur="4.75">resurrection Sabbath not resurrection</text>
  <text start="343.02" dur="5.97">sunday so he rose yesterday at twilight</text>
  <text start="345.57" dur="5.069">and then the following day is when the</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="3.78">women of course discovered that the tomb</text>
  <text start="350.639" dur="5.011">was empty and they discovered that yash</text>
  <text start="352.77" dur="4.53">would already risen and so this is the</text>
  <text start="355.65" dur="3.48">day of the firstfruits now just as the</text>
  <text start="357.3" dur="3.72">high priest would take those shocks of</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="3.96">barley from everyone that are brought up</text>
  <text start="361.02" dur="4.44">their first fruit barley harvest and</text>
  <text start="363.09" dur="5.16">would waive them before Yahweh in the</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="4.41">holy place so 2 Yahshua on the day of</text>
  <text start="368.25" dur="3.81">the firstfruits after he&amp;#39;d already risen</text>
  <text start="369.87" dur="5.07">from the grave at the end of the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="372.06" dur="5.669">the day before he would now ascend up to</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="4.62">the Father and wave himself as a first</text>
  <text start="377.729" dur="4.461">fruit from among the dead just as the</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="5.88">high priests was waving the barley and</text>
  <text start="382.19" dur="4.96">the high priest as long as he was in the</text>
  <text start="385.44" dur="3.63">process of taking these shocks of the</text>
  <text start="387.15" dur="3.81">first fruit barley from everyone and</text>
  <text start="389.07" dur="4.8">waving them in the holy place he could</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="4.47">not allow anyone to be touched excuse me</text>
  <text start="393.87" dur="4.47">he could not allow anyone to</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="4.32">Jim because if say maybe a woman who was</text>
  <text start="398.34" dur="3.45">on her period or whatever happened to</text>
  <text start="399.75" dur="3.84">touch him or maybe a man who had had</text>
  <text start="401.79" dur="4.32">sexual intercourse with his wife happen</text>
  <text start="403.59" dur="3.69">to touch him he would be unclean and he</text>
  <text start="406.11" dur="3.24">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to go into the holy</text>
  <text start="407.28" dur="3.96">place so no one was permitted to touch</text>
  <text start="409.35" dur="4.05">the high priest while he was in the</text>
  <text start="411.24" dur="4.01">process of gathering these first fruits</text>
  <text start="413.4" dur="4.26">of Riley&amp;#39;s shocks from the people and</text>
  <text start="415.25" dur="5.02">waving them before Yahweh in the same</text>
  <text start="417.66" dur="5.43">way when if you remember the story of</text>
  <text start="420.27" dur="4.47">Miriam at the tomb that that morning of</text>
  <text start="423.09" dur="4.38">the first fruits and she discovered the</text>
  <text start="424.74" dur="5.28">tomb is empty Yahshua appeared to her</text>
  <text start="427.47" dur="3.96">and asked her why she was weeping and at</text>
  <text start="430.02" dur="2.64">first you know she thought he was the</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="3">gardener and then he realized it was</text>
  <text start="432.66" dur="4.05">Yahshua and she was overcome with</text>
  <text start="434.43" dur="4.47">emotion and so she she reached forward</text>
  <text start="436.71" dur="5.82">to embrace him and Yahshua stepped back</text>
  <text start="438.9" dur="6.18">and said wait don&amp;#39;t touch me yet I have</text>
  <text start="442.53" dur="4.11">not yet ascended unto my father so just</text>
  <text start="445.08" dur="3.84">as the high priest couldn&amp;#39;t be touched</text>
  <text start="446.64" dur="3.81">until he had finished the process of</text>
  <text start="448.92" dur="3.84">waiving all the first fruit barley</text>
  <text start="450.45" dur="3.84">shocks in the holy place so to Yahshua</text>
  <text start="452.76" dur="3.78">could not be touched because he had not</text>
  <text start="454.29" dur="4.02">yet ascended but of course later it that</text>
  <text start="456.54" dur="4.17">day on the feast of firstfruits to</text>
  <text start="458.31" dur="5.04">fulfill the feast of firstfruits he did</text>
  <text start="460.71" dur="4.95">in fact ascend up to the father and he</text>
  <text start="463.35" dur="3.69">waved them sup himself as a first food</text>
  <text start="465.66" dur="3.24">offerings he&amp;#39;s been in the grave for</text>
  <text start="467.04" dur="4.14">three days and three nights he had risen</text>
  <text start="468.9" dur="4.59">at the end of Sabbath resurrections</text>
  <text start="471.18" dur="4.71">Shabbat and the next day which is today</text>
  <text start="473.49" dur="5.31">the feast of firstfruits he wave himself</text>
  <text start="475.89" dur="7.29">as a first fruit as a first fruit</text>
  <text start="478.8" dur="6.99">resurrection so in any case this is a</text>
  <text start="483.18" dur="4.17">very important day because it does mark</text>
  <text start="485.79" dur="3.63">not only when the resurrection was</text>
  <text start="487.35" dur="3.65">discovered keep in mind the resurrection</text>
  <text start="489.42" dur="3.57">happened on Shabbat which was yesterday</text>
  <text start="491" dur="4.03">but today is the day when the</text>
  <text start="492.99" dur="4.2">resurrection was discovered by the women</text>
  <text start="495.03" dur="4.47">and then by the disciples and it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="497.19" dur="3.75">the day that Yahshua wave himself before</text>
  <text start="499.5" dur="3.33">the father just as the high priest was</text>
  <text start="500.94" dur="3.75">waving those shocks of barley in the</text>
  <text start="502.83" dur="3.9">holy temple on the same day is they</text>
  <text start="504.69" dur="3.6">filled that feasts and wave himself he</text>
  <text start="506.73" dur="3.33">became the first fruit from among the</text>
  <text start="508.29" dur="4.59">dead which of course would pave the way</text>
  <text start="510.06" dur="5.4">for us to become a kind of firstfruits</text>
  <text start="512.88" dur="4.17">as James talks about when we when we</text>
