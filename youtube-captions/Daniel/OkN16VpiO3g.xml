  <text start="182.6" dur="5.58">really really fascinating that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="184.94" dur="8.7">occurring this year so when we got to</text>
  <text start="188.18" dur="10.11">Purim okay which was back in late March</text>
  <text start="193.64" dur="7.98">right around Purim that is when that was</text>
  <text start="198.29" dur="8.55">when Bar Attorney General bar came out</text>
  <text start="201.62" dur="8.37">with his assessment of the Mueller</text>
  <text start="206.84" dur="5.97">report and this is basically what led to</text>
  <text start="209.99" dur="4.8">the exoneration of President Trump right</text>
  <text start="212.81" dur="3.78">and and so many people finally starting</text>
  <text start="214.79" dur="4.23">to really wake up about this and of</text>
  <text start="216.59" dur="4.23">course it put the the media into a hissy</text>

  <text start="229.82" dur="11.73">Mueller report was released full M&amp;#39;Lynn</text>
  <text start="236.45" dur="8.4">for our release and which of course has</text>
  <text start="241.55" dur="5.49">caused the media to go into a bunch a</text>
  <text start="244.85" dur="4.68">bunch of hissy fits right but this</text>
  <text start="247.04" dur="4.5">minute part was fully released and we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="262.45" dur="3.66">implications about what was happening as</text>
  <text start="263.95" dur="3.36">if that matters of course anyone would</text>
  <text start="266.11" dur="4.92">be worried about the political</text>
  <text start="267.31" dur="5.85">implications of wicked people trying to</text>
  <text start="271.03" dur="4.41">bring about a false accusation against</text>
  <text start="273.16" dur="4.08">the office of the presidency but the</text>
  <text start="275.44" dur="4.65">full report is released right around</text>

  <text start="631.79" dur="7.02">Pentecost before chevre woke he on mount</text>
  <text start="634.85" dur="6.81">Olive&amp;#39;s he rose again he ascended up to</text>
  <text start="638.81" dur="6.06">the heavens of cloud swallowed him up</text>
  <text start="641.66" dur="5.31">and he basically told the disciples to</text>
  <text start="644.87" dur="4.08">wait to tarry in Jerusalem until they</text>
  <text start="646.97" dur="3.48">get imbued with power from on high</text>
  <text start="648.95" dur="5.76">they get filled with the ruach ha&amp;#39;qodesh</text>
  <text start="650.45" dur="6">the Holy Spirit so for those forty days</text>
  <text start="654.71" dur="3.58">he&amp;#39;s walking with them in his</text>
  <text start="656.45" dur="3.79">resurrected body he</text>
  <text start="658.29" dur="4.77">he&amp;#39;s showing them the scriptures thing</text>
  <text start="660.24" dur="4.529">he&amp;#39;s just he&amp;#39;s proving himself that he</text>
  <text start="663.06" dur="4.709">rose from the dead during those 40 days</text>
  <text start="664.769" dur="6.711">and as I was looking at that I was</text>
  <text start="667.769" dur="6.18">reminded of thousands of years earlier</text>
  <text start="671.48" dur="5.46">when the children of Israel came out of</text>
  <text start="673.949" dur="6.991">Egypt and they went up to Mount Sinai</text>
  <text start="676.94" dur="6.61">Moses he went up to the mountain for 40</text>
  <text start="680.94" dur="6.019">days and he was up there for 40 days</text>
  <text start="683.55" dur="5.82">with yah the top of that mountain and</text>
  <text start="686.959" dur="4.331">during that 40 days the children of</text>
  <text start="689.37" dur="3.99">Israel they began to grow restless</text>
  <text start="691.29" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re like where is Moses we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="693.36" dur="3.39">know where he is it looks like he&amp;#39;s gone</text>
  <text start="694.92" dur="3.51">away and so they made themselves as</text>
  <text start="696.75" dur="2.37">golden calf and they got into all this</text>
  <text start="698.43" dur="3.75">trouble</text>
  <text start="699.12" dur="5.639">in fact about 3,000 of them got killed</text>
  <text start="702.18" dur="4.349">through God&amp;#39;s judgment because of them</text>
  <text start="704.759" dur="5.221">getting involved with this paganism and</text>
  <text start="706.529" dur="8.011">the scope golden calf well in the same</text>
  <text start="709.98" dur="7.2">way in a reverse situation Yahshua now</text>
  <text start="714.54" dur="4.219">comes and he spends 40 days with the</text>
  <text start="717.18" dur="4.079">children of Israel with his disciples</text>
  <text start="718.759" dur="6.341">Jesus the Messiah spends that forty days</text>
  <text start="721.259" dur="6.39">and that of course eventually leads to</text>
  <text start="725.1" dur="5.34">Pentecost where the disciples get filled</text>
  <text start="727.649" dur="4.74">with the Ruach and rather than three</text>
  <text start="730.44" dur="3.449">thousands are likes dying as they had</text>
  <text start="732.389" dur="3.75">three thousand years earlier when they</text>
  <text start="733.889" dur="3.871">got involved that paganism now we read</text>
  <text start="736.139" dur="4.5">in the book of Acts that three thousand</text>
  <text start="737.76" dur="4.92">souls are added added to the body of</text>
  <text start="740.639" dur="5.01">Messiah through the anointed preaching</text>
  <text start="742.68" dur="7.649">of Peter so I just thought it was neat</text>
  <text start="745.649" dur="7.38">how it was almost like Messiah he he</text>
  <text start="750.329" dur="4.591">sort of undid what had happened when</text>
  <text start="753.029" dur="3.81">Moses was up on that mountain and the</text>
  <text start="754.92" dur="4.02">children of Israel got involved in that</text>
  <text start="756.839" dur="4.081">forty days that they got involved with</text>
  <text start="758.94" dur="4.11">paganism he undid that by coming down</text>
  <text start="760.92" dur="4.26">and spending that forty days with the</text>
  <text start="763.05" dur="3.899">disciples and that&amp;#39;s what happens from</text>
