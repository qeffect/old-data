  <text start="223.7" dur="4.59">in order to get to the safe place be</text>
  <text start="226.31" dur="5.04">safe place which there&amp;#39;s only going to</text>
  <text start="228.29" dur="5.04">be one it&amp;#39;s going to be not by might and</text>
  <text start="231.35" dur="3.78">not by power but by my spirit says</text>
  <text start="233.33" dur="5.04">Yahweh that&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s going to be in</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="5.1">these last days so anyone that&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="238.37" dur="4.2">to get there by their own flesh the arm</text>
  <text start="240.23" dur="5.13">of their own flesh yah took me to a</text>
  <text start="242.57" dur="4.41">passage in the book of jeremiah where if</text>
  <text start="245.36" dur="3.659">you remember the poor of the land the</text>
  <text start="246.98" dur="4.56">remnant that had survived after the</text>
  <text start="249.019" dur="4.401">Babylonians had destroyed Jerusalem and</text>
  <text start="251.54" dur="4.949">burned the temple to the ground that</text>
  <text start="253.42" dur="5.26">remnant yah said hey just stay stay put</text>
  <text start="256.489" dur="4.111">stay in Jerusalem and you&amp;#39;ll be fine but</text>
  <text start="258.68" dur="3.989">instead they wanted to find their own</text>
  <text start="260.6" dur="3.54">safe place with the arm of the flesh and</text>
  <text start="262.669" dur="2.981">they decided to go down to Egypt and</text>
  <text start="264.14" dur="4.779">they even forced Jeremiah</text>
  <text start="265.65" dur="5.16">the Prophet to go with them and that was</text>
  <text start="268.919" dur="4.861">wicked and and most of them wound up</text>
  <text start="270.81" dur="3.87">getting destroyed down in Egypt and</text>
  <text start="273.78" dur="2.58">that&amp;#39;s the same thing that&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="3.48">with this guy in Utah you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="276.36" dur="4.649">setting up this 400 acres property as</text>
  <text start="278.16" dur="4.44">like a counterfeit safe place and then</text>
  <text start="281.009" dur="4.051">he thinks that by the armor the flesh is</text>
  <text start="282.6" dur="4.08">going to somehow find it no that&amp;#39;s the e</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="3.51">soft spirit and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="4.799">believers are so-called believers out</text>
  <text start="288.57" dur="5.31">there they&amp;#39;re not of the Yaakov spirit</text>
  <text start="291.479" dur="5.31">not of Yahshua there of the Esau spirit</text>
  <text start="293.88" dur="4.89">like edomites and I&amp;#39;m telling you if you</text>
  <text start="296.789" dur="4.831">try to find the safe place with the arm</text>
  <text start="298.77" dur="5.79">of the flesh it&amp;#39;s going to lead you to</text>
  <text start="301.62" dur="4.769">destruction and annihilation the only</text>
  <text start="304.56" dur="3.75">way that you are going to get to the</text>
  <text start="306.389" dur="4.65">safe place is you are totally in love</text>
