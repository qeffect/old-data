  <text start="83.07" dur="2.79">and i thought it was a really really</text>
  <text start="84.119" dur="3.481">really good point we have to wait until</text>
  <text start="85.86" dur="4.259">he actually leaves and of course we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="87.6" dur="4.83">hoping that Ratcliffe is the one who</text>
  <text start="90.119" dur="3.841">will replace him I really would love</text>
  <text start="92.43" dur="3.71">Ratcliffe to be in there of course the</text>
  <text start="93.96" dur="4.56">Senate Judiciary Committee</text>
  <text start="96.14" dur="4.42">yeah the Senate Judiciary Committee has</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="3.33">to actually confirm Ratcliffe</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="3.089">we know the deep state doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="101.85" dur="3.39">Ratcliffe in I mean not only is</text>
  <text start="103.649" dur="3.571">Ratcliffe critical Mueller not only as</text>
  <text start="105.24" dur="3.96">he pointed out that the Obama</text>
  <text start="107.22" dur="4.89">administration is guilty of high crimes</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="4.68">and misdemeanors and spying on a sitting</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="3.84">president but also he was even quoting</text>
  <text start="113.88" dur="5.46">from Jonathan Kent II in a speech about</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="5.97">the FBI having secret societies and the</text>
  <text start="119.34" dur="5.55">problems of secret societies within our</text>
  <text start="121.92" dur="6.809">government yeah I think Ratcliffe is a</text>
  <text start="124.89" dur="6.989">big huge nightmare for the deep state so</text>
  <text start="128.729" dur="3.691">yesterday it was announced Trump seats a</text>
  <text start="131.879" dur="2.761">hundred</text>
  <text start="132.42" dur="4.649">forty-four federal judges I love that</text>
  <text start="134.64" dur="3.66">number 144 if you&amp;#39;re familiar with the</text>
  <text start="137.069" dur="3.691">book of Revelation of course there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.3" dur="4.95">talk about the 144,000 so I&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="140.76" dur="3.99">loved that number but it says President</text>
  <text start="143.25" dur="4.38">Donald Trump is making good on his</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="4.35">promise to appoint pro-life judges by</text>
  <text start="147.63" dur="3.99">having as a hundred and forty fourth</text>
  <text start="149.1" dur="4.56">federal judge confirmed by the US Senate</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="4.38">as of August 1st the Senate has</text>
  <text start="153.66" dur="5.79">confirmed a hundred and forty-four of</text>
  <text start="156" dur="5.76">trumps 194 nominations to the federal</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="4.92">judiciary with another a hundred</text>
  <text start="161.76" dur="4.559">thirteen vacancies yet to be filled and</text>
  <text start="164.37" dur="3.78">of course we know that it&amp;#39;s these</text>
  <text start="166.319" dur="3.601">federal judges that have to be replaced</text>
  <text start="168.15" dur="4.2">in order for these mass or s to go</text>
  <text start="169.92" dur="4.71">forward and yes I know there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="172.35" dur="4.109">be military tribunals but I do not think</text>
  <text start="174.63" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s going to be solely military</text>
  <text start="176.459" dur="4.291">tribunals there will be military</text>
  <text start="178.08" dur="4.65">tribunals along with civilian courts so</text>
  <text start="180.75" dur="5.76">he has to clean up a lot of these</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="5.58">positions we&amp;#39;re dealing with tens of</text>
  <text start="186.51" dur="3.78">thousands of indictments and even one</text>
  <text start="188.31" dur="4.53">indictment can cover as many as I think</text>
  <text start="190.29" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s like I don&amp;#39;t know how many people</text>
  <text start="192.84" dur="3.63">can be under one indictment but it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="194.58" dur="4.409">more than one that&amp;#39;s for sure find out a</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="4.41">lot a lot of satanic pedophiles a lot of</text>
  <text start="198.989" dur="4.681">child sex traffickers a lot of these</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="4.919">people in all sorts of positions and I</text>
  <text start="203.67" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t think military tribunals are going</text>
  <text start="205.799" dur="3.601">to be solely used I think it&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="207.18" dur="3.99">mixture of military and civilian and</text>
  <text start="209.4" dur="3.869">again this is one of the reasons why</text>
  <text start="211.17" dur="4.53">President Trump has got a got to replace</text>
  <text start="213.269" dur="6.451">a lot of these federal judges and and</text>
  <text start="215.7" dur="6.36">revamp our courts now Tiffany Fitz and</text>
