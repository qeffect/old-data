  <text start="2.7" dur="7.53">Torah restoration ministries the website</text>
  <text start="4.98" dur="7.949">is WWN torah comm and this is my weekly</text>
  <text start="10.23" dur="5.1">midweek podcast episode 47</text>
  <text start="12.929" dur="4.951">where did Thanksgiving come from I</text>
  <text start="15.33" dur="4.44">thought this would be a timely topic to</text>
  <text start="17.88" dur="3.54">go over especially since Thanksgiving</text>
  <text start="19.77" dur="4.95">will be occurring in a little over a</text>
  <text start="21.42" dur="5.88">week from now and you know we have this</text>
  <text start="24.72" dur="4.139">day the last Thursday of every November</text>
  <text start="27.3" dur="3.149">here in the United States where we</text>
  <text start="28.859" dur="4.051">celebrate this holiday called</text>
  <text start="30.449" dur="5.311">Thanksgiving and people decorate their</text>
  <text start="32.91" dur="4.649">houses in the fall colors and most</text>
  <text start="35.76" dur="3.479">people gather for a meal that day watch</text>
  <text start="37.559" dur="4.381">football stuff themselves with turkey</text>
  <text start="39.239" dur="5.611">and all the other great things that that</text>
  <text start="41.94" dur="4.709">are made for that meal and it&amp;#39;s a time</text>
  <text start="44.85" dur="3.57">of Thanksgiving I mean to this day it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="46.649" dur="3.151">still time of Thanksgiving what I think</text>
  <text start="48.42" dur="2.639">is interesting about Thanksgiving is</text>
  <text start="49.8" dur="4.2">that if you notice it doesn&amp;#39;t have a lot</text>
  <text start="51.059" dur="4.23">of the commercialism or paganism that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="54" dur="2.64">associated with a lot of the other</text>
  <text start="55.289" dur="3.66">holiday something of course you have</text>
  <text start="56.64" dur="4.89">Halloween which is just drenched in in</text>
  <text start="58.949" dur="5.161">Satanism you have Christmas which is</text>
  <text start="61.53" dur="4.14">very very much into the pagan elements</text>
  <text start="64.11" dur="5.91">such as the Christmas trees and Santa</text>
  <text start="65.67" dur="6.54">Claus you have a lot of commercialism</text>
  <text start="70.02" dur="3.69">and paganism surrounding Easter with the</text>
  <text start="72.21" dur="3.35">bunny rabbit but with Thanksgiving we</text>
  <text start="73.71" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t really see that I mean we have the</text>
  <text start="75.56" dur="5.379">the Thanksgiving turkey and that&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="77.82" dur="5.7">it so um I think there&amp;#39;s a really good</text>
  <text start="80.939" dur="4.5">reason why Thanksgivings not surrounded</text>
  <text start="83.52" dur="4.22">by commercialism and paganism like the</text>
  <text start="85.439" dur="6.18">other holidays are and that is because</text>
  <text start="87.74" dur="5.41">Thanksgiving comes from the Biblical</text>
  <text start="91.619" dur="5.04">Hebrew feast</text>
  <text start="93.15" dur="6.75">known as Sukkot now if you go back a few</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="6.96">episodes you can you can see where I had</text>
  <text start="99.9" dur="6.42">a whole podcast on the feast days that</text>
  <text start="103.619" dur="5.881">occurred this fall and one of those was</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="5.339">for Sukkot where we erect a tent and we</text>
  <text start="109.5" dur="4.29">eat and celebrate and fellowship and</text>
  <text start="111.659" dur="5.011">worship yot and we&amp;#39;re a very it is a is</text>
  <text start="113.79" dur="5.49">a feast of Thanksgiving that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.67" dur="4.019">known for because you&amp;#39;re bringing in its</text>
  <text start="119.28" dur="2.82">an ingathering of the fruit harvest</text>
  <text start="120.689" dur="3.871">which is the greatest harvest in Israel</text>
  <text start="122.1" dur="4.29">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a truly a time where</text>
  <text start="124.56" dur="3.589">you&amp;#39;re commanded to rejoice and and and</text>
  <text start="126.39" dur="4.77">to think yeah for everything he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="128.149" dur="4.541">which is why it may Sukkot is one of the</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="5.37">greatest feasts of</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="6">on the Hebrew calendar so if you turn</text>
  <text start="136.53" dur="4.17">back the pages in history what you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="138.69" dur="4.71">discover is that when the pilgrims or</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="6.06">Puritans when they first came over to</text>
  <text start="143.4" dur="5.61">America that first Thanksgiving that</text>
  <text start="146.76" dur="4.77">they had with the Indians was a Sukkot</text>
  <text start="149.01" dur="4.17">celebration now they did not celebrate</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="3.63">the Sukkot at the end of November like</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="3.57">we do they actually originally</text>
  <text start="155.16" dur="3.63">celebrated the suit coat or this</text>
  <text start="156.75" dur="4.8">Thanksgiving Day in October which is</text>
  <text start="158.79" dur="4.08">when Canada still to this day keeps</text>
  <text start="161.55" dur="5.82">Thanksgiving they usually keep it on</text>
  <text start="162.87" dur="6.48">October 11th or so so they were actually</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="6.72">keeping a suit coat with the Indians</text>
  <text start="169.35" dur="6.33">with the Native Americans and you know</text>
  <text start="174.09" dur="3.78">the Puritans or the pilgrims that</text>
  <text start="175.68" dur="3.89">they&amp;#39;ve been they&amp;#39;ve gotten a bad rap in</text>
  <text start="177.87" dur="3.6">history they&amp;#39;ve been stigmatized</text>
  <text start="179.57" dur="3.46">especially in our public schools you</text>
  <text start="181.47" dur="5.25">read about the Puritans the Pilgrims</text>
  <text start="183.03" dur="6.71">being these sort of stalwart dour grim</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="5.43">people who wore all black or gray and</text>
  <text start="189.74" dur="4.21">you know we&amp;#39;re against dancing and all</text>
  <text start="192.15" dur="4.19">sorts of things but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="193.95" dur="6.2">not the case in fact if you look at the</text>
  <text start="196.34" dur="6.54">picture that that I put on this podcast</text>
  <text start="200.15" dur="4.9">you&amp;#39;ll see right there in the foreground</text>
  <text start="202.88" dur="3.49">and you don&amp;#39;t see a lot of Puritans in</text>
  <text start="205.05" dur="3.27">this picture but you&amp;#39;ll see that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.37" dur="4.32">a woman there and she&amp;#39;s dressed in a</text>
  <text start="208.32" dur="4.56">beautiful blue dress</text>
  <text start="210.69" dur="5.16">Puritans dressed in all sorts of colors</text>
  <text start="212.88" dur="5.67">the the the the the idea that they dress</text>
  <text start="215.85" dur="5.49">in grays and blacks is a misnomer they</text>
  <text start="218.55" dur="5.18">they dress in very vibrant beautiful</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="6.51">colors this is this is a documented fact</text>
  <text start="223.73" dur="7.72">and they were very they were very happy</text>
  <text start="227.85" dur="6.33">joyful and thankful people a lot of the</text>
  <text start="231.45" dur="4.86">Puritan sects did honor the Jewish</text>
  <text start="234.18" dur="7.29">Sabbath from Friday evening to Saturday</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="9.03">evening not all but but many did in in</text>
  <text start="241.47" dur="6.14">in in the 1600s there were in the I</text>
  <text start="245.34" dur="5.75">think it&amp;#39;s the Massachusetts Bay Colony</text>
  <text start="247.61" dur="6.129">the whole idea and holiday of Christmas</text>
  <text start="251.09" dur="4.72">was banned it was illegal to celebrate</text>
  <text start="253.739" dur="4.291">Christmas in the Massachusetts Bay</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="5.429">Colony in the 1600s and in fact even</text>
  <text start="258.03" dur="5.94">when you skip forward 150 years to the</text>
  <text start="261.239" dur="4.05">Revolution at the end of the 1700s most</text>
  <text start="263.97" dur="2.49">Americans still did not celebrate</text>
  <text start="265.289" dur="4.38">Christmas it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="266.46" dur="5.359">legal anymore but because the nation was</text>
  <text start="269.669" dur="4.231">so young it was still so happily</text>
  <text start="271.819" dur="4.44">influenced by the Puritan pilgrim</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="4.59">culture that had developed the colonies</text>
  <text start="276.259" dur="5.94">most people did not celebrate Christmas</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="6.899">and in fact it was this Puritan pilgrim</text>
  <text start="282.199" dur="4.631">tendency to adopt the Jewish Hebrew</text>
  <text start="285.389" dur="3.09">holidays not because they wanted to be</text>
  <text start="286.83" dur="3.03">Jewish but because they wanted to be</text>
  <text start="288.479" dur="4.081">Christian they wanted to follow and keep</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="4.589">the Bible and because of this the Jews</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="3.81">oftentimes found a safe haven in the</text>
  <text start="294.449" dur="3.421">United States whereas everywhere else</text>
  <text start="296.37" dur="2.84">they would go including England they</text>
  <text start="297.87" dur="3.84">would be persecuted</text>
  <text start="299.21" dur="4.45">so that first Thanksgiving that they</text>
  <text start="301.71" dur="3.269">would celebrate every act that they</text>
  <text start="303.66" dur="3.09">celebrated in October that first</text>
  <text start="304.979" dur="4.051">Thanksgiving it was it was of course a</text>
  <text start="306.75" dur="3.66">huge meal a time of Thanksgiving a time</text>
  <text start="309.03" dur="2.97">with the Indians it probably did not</text>
  <text start="310.41" dur="3.36">last just one day but was probably an</text>
  <text start="312" dur="4.289">eight day festival just like Sukkot</text>
  <text start="313.77" dur="4.35">would have been because like I said many</text>
  <text start="316.289" dur="6.571">of the Puritans and pilgrims were</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="7.949">keeping the Hebrew feast days now how</text>
  <text start="322.86" dur="5.61">did our modern-day Thanksgiving get get</text>
  <text start="326.069" dur="4.561">put at the end of November more than a</text>
  <text start="328.47" dur="4.879">month after when it would when it was</text>
  <text start="330.63" dur="6.39">celebrated well what happened was in the</text>
  <text start="333.349" dur="6.011">1860s President Abraham Lincoln decided</text>
  <text start="337.02" dur="5.399">by a proclamation a presidential decree</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="5.94">to move Thanksgiving from October until</text>
  <text start="342.419" dur="5.37">a month later Thanksgiving and and to</text>
  <text start="345.3" dur="4.26">November now this this is not a good</text>
  <text start="347.789" dur="6.12">thing because we read in the scriptures</text>
  <text start="349.56" dur="6.389">that the very first King Jeroboam of of</text>
  <text start="353.909" dur="5.721">Israel the northern the Northern Kingdom</text>
  <text start="355.949" dur="6.75">after it had split under Rehoboam reign</text>
  <text start="359.63" dur="4.539">the very first king decided in order to</text>
  <text start="362.699" dur="3.511">separate themselves from the southern</text>
  <text start="364.169" dur="5.011">kingdom - first of all move the capital</text>
  <text start="366.21" dur="5.16">and worship to Samaria which was wrong</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="4.919">and then to move the fee states a month</text>
  <text start="371.37" dur="5.22">later and this was a this was an act of</text>
  <text start="374.099" dur="5.151">rebellion and idolatry and was evil</text>
  <text start="376.59" dur="4.56">so when Abraham Lincoln did this he was</text>
  <text start="379.25" dur="4.12">either consciously or unconsciously</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="4.049">following in the footsteps of that very</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="5.22">wicked first king of the northern tribes</text>
  <text start="385.199" dur="6.661">when Israel was split and not a good</text>
  <text start="388.59" dur="5.819">thing we need to be celebrating Sukkot</text>
  <text start="391.86" dur="6.089">when yah tells us - and that that is</text>
  <text start="394.409" dur="5.361">clearly in the fall the early fall in</text>
  <text start="397.949" dur="5.271">October is when Sukkot -</text>
  <text start="399.77" dur="7.35">quickly Falls can be anywhere from late</text>
  <text start="403.22" dur="7.56">October to early October and and that is</text>
  <text start="407.12" dur="5.13">when we need to keep Sukkot but I think</text>
  <text start="410.78" dur="3.93">that that again the reason why</text>
  <text start="412.25" dur="4.169">Thanksgiving has been so free of all the</text>
  <text start="414.71" dur="4.29">trappings of commercialism of paganism</text>
  <text start="416.419" dur="5.791">is because it has its direct routes in</text>
  <text start="419" dur="5.37">the Pilgrims and Puritans who were</text>
  <text start="422.21" dur="4.5">keeping Sukkot who were celebrating this</text>
  <text start="424.37" dur="4.62">Hebrew feast day again not because they</text>
  <text start="426.71" dur="7.739">wanted to be Jewish but because they</text>
  <text start="428.99" dur="7.32">wanted to be biblical and in fact if you</text>
  <text start="434.449" dur="4.921">get a book called the light in the glory</text>
  <text start="436.31" dur="5.13">by Peter Marshall he goes through a lot</text>
  <text start="439.37" dur="3.87">of documented evidence not stuff you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="441.44" dur="3.78">read in the public school system but but</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="4.56">documented first source and second</text>
  <text start="445.22" dur="4.65">source information that shows that many</text>
  <text start="447.8" dur="3.869">of the Puritans and pilgrims even up</text>
  <text start="449.87" dur="4.26">into the founding fathers they viewed</text>
  <text start="451.669" dur="4.56">themselves as a second Israel they</text>
  <text start="454.13" dur="4.77">wanted America the United States the</text>
  <text start="456.229" dur="4.65">colonies to be a second Israel a light</text>
  <text start="458.9" dur="4.56">on the hill just like the first Israel</text>
  <text start="460.879" dur="4.41">were supposed to be and so they they</text>
  <text start="463.46" dur="3.329">clearly enunciated this over and over</text>
  <text start="465.289" dur="3.6">again so it should be no great surprise</text>
  <text start="466.789" dur="4.611">that we discover that many of these</text>
  <text start="468.889" dur="4.851">Puritans and pilgrims who were very very</text>
  <text start="471.4" dur="4.569">centered in faith I mean we know that</text>
  <text start="473.74" dur="3.97">even if you have the rudimentary public</text>
  <text start="475.969" dur="3.841">school education you know that the</text>
  <text start="477.71" dur="5.1">Puritans boaters were very religious so</text>
  <text start="479.81" dur="5.789">faith in Yahweh was extremely important</text>
  <text start="482.81" dur="4.469">to them and so it should come as no</text>
  <text start="485.599" dur="3.451">surprise that if they view themselves as</text>
  <text start="487.279" dur="5.911">a second Israel that they would also</text>
  <text start="489.05" dur="6.239">keep the Hebrew Sabbath day and the</text>
  <text start="493.19" dur="5.279">Hebrew feast days and indeed they did it</text>
  <text start="495.289" dur="5.341">was something that that they did so I</text>
  <text start="498.469" dur="4.141">think it&amp;#39;s important to remember that as</text>
  <text start="500.63" dur="5.129">we&amp;#39;re approaching the Thanksgiving</text>
  <text start="502.61" dur="4.859">holiday coming up next week that that</text>
  <text start="505.759" dur="4.671">you realize that this this holiday has</text>
  <text start="507.469" dur="6.721">its roots in very biblically based</text>
  <text start="510.43" dur="6.58">Puritans and pilgrims who planted the</text>
  <text start="514.19" dur="4.74">seeds of this of this nation and and</text>
  <text start="517.01" dur="4.98">ultimately has its roots in the biblical</text>
  <text start="518.93" dur="5.219">feast of Sukkot and then that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="521.99" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s why we keep it to this day it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="524.149" dur="5.791">another reminder that this nation needs</text>
  <text start="526.91" dur="5.6">to repent and return to Hebrew Jewish</text>
  <text start="529.94" dur="5.3">roots to her mess</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="5.91">anok Hebrew Jewish roots because that is</text>
  <text start="535.24" dur="4.8">where they were they were based in and</text>
  <text start="538.42" dur="3.09">no they didn&amp;#39;t call themselves Messianic</text>
  <text start="540.04" dur="4.44">Jews and again they weren&amp;#39;t trying to</text>
  <text start="541.51" dur="5.01">become Jewish they simply wanted to be</text>
  <text start="544.48" dur="4.02">authentic believers who aligned their</text>
  <text start="546.52" dur="4.02">lives and their doctrines and and what</text>
  <text start="548.5" dur="5.88">they celebrated with the scripture and</text>
  <text start="550.54" dur="5.82">that&amp;#39;s exactly what they did so I hope</text>
  <text start="554.38" dur="4.05">this little study and history lesson has</text>
  <text start="556.36" dur="3.66">been enlightening for you if you are</text>
  <text start="558.43" dur="3.18">planning to celebrate Thanksgiving next</text>
  <text start="560.02" dur="3.21">or next week</text>
  <text start="561.61" dur="3.9">please remember where it came from and</text>
  <text start="563.23" dur="5.25">please do yourself a favor and next year</text>
  <text start="565.51" dur="4.71">celebrate Sukkot when Yahweh tells us to</text>
  <text start="568.48" dur="4.47">celebrate it not when Abraham Lincoln</text>
  <text start="570.22" dur="4.71">does and that again is going to be in</text>
  <text start="572.95" dur="5.04">October in fact next year Sukkot will</text>
  <text start="574.93" dur="4.74">fall during the first week of October so</text>
  <text start="577.99" dur="4.17">I encourage you please next year honor</text>
  <text start="579.67" dur="4.38">got--we keep Sukkot when it&amp;#39;s supposed</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="4.2">to be kept because Yahweh wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="584.05" dur="4.62">expect as specified a time unless it</text>
  <text start="586.36" dur="5.61">mattered to him let&amp;#39;s do things the way</text>
  <text start="588.67" dur="5.1">he told us not the way man tells us all</text>
  <text start="591.97" dur="2.49">right Shalom I will see you again on</text>
  <text start="593.77" dur="3.68">Shabbat</text>
