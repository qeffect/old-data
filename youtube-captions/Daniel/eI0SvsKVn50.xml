  <text start="136.71" dur="6.72">now let&amp;#39;s look at some examples turn in</text>
  <text start="140.07" dur="5.34">your Bibles to Romans chapter 14 Romans</text>
  <text start="143.43" dur="5.13">14 is a chapter drawn from a chapter in</text>
  <text start="145.41" dur="5.49">Zechariah Paul midrash Azure teaches on</text>
  <text start="148.56" dur="4.23">this old testament book applies it to</text>

  <text start="156.39" dur="5.13">an even clearer image of our Savior</text>
  <text start="158.25" dur="6">Yahshua as we apply the torrid to our</text>
  <text start="161.52" dur="5.67">lives and obey every jot and tittle even</text>
  <text start="164.25" dur="6.06">as Matthew 519 commands us we to receive</text>
  <text start="167.19" dur="4.86">greater revelation of Christ the Hebrew</text>

  <text start="176.85" dur="3.96">written these these days help paint and</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="5.04">vivid pictures in our souls hearts and</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="4.98">minds of who our Messiah is these are</text>
  <text start="183.63" dur="3.81">not just stale old Jewish holidays that</text>
  <text start="185.79" dur="3.54">the Christian world disdains or even or</text>
  <text start="187.44" dur="4.59">that even the Messianic world thinks are</text>
  <text start="189.33" dur="4.74">cool these are precious holy days which</text>

  <text start="205.65" dur="4.47">observing the Sabbath and New Moon&amp;#39;s etc</text>
  <text start="207.54" dur="5.13">help only to draw us closer and closer</text>
  <text start="210.12" dur="4.29">to Messiah removing the quote glass</text>
  <text start="212.67" dur="4.2">which we presently see through darkly</text>
  <text start="214.41" dur="4.86">and shining the light of the gospel into</text>
  <text start="216.87" dur="3.96">us more and more brightly every time we</text>
  <text start="219.27" dur="3.48">prove our love to you through our</text>
  <text start="220.83" dur="5.28">submission to His divine will by keeping</text>
  <text start="222.75" dur="6.06">his Torah and the supreme beauty of this</text>
  <text start="226.11" dur="6.15">panoramic Torah we know that the Torah</text>
  <text start="228.81" dur="5.42">is perfect in converting the soul do you</text>
  <text start="232.26" dur="4.26">realize what that statement means</text>
  <text start="234.23" dur="4.24">whether your heart is wicked and in</text>
  <text start="236.52" dur="3.93">rebellion to yacht or righteous and and</text>
  <text start="238.47" dur="4.44">love to you keeping Torah will</text>
  <text start="240.45" dur="5.1">necessarily soften your heart and bring</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="4.35">you closer to yacht this is why the</text>
  <text start="245.55" dur="4.32">Torah is more precious than fine gold</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="5.49">and sweeter than honey according to</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="4.56">David in psalm 119 keeping torrid</text>
  <text start="252.75" dur="5.489">deserts perfect work on our souls</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="5.97">whether we be sinner or saint but then</text>
  <text start="258.239" dur="4.351">you might ask why did the Jewish and</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="4.239">Hebrew peoples who kept Torah wind up so</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="4.69">apostate so many times</text>
  <text start="264.639" dur="4.381">well because if you examine what they</text>
  <text start="267.28" dur="4.259">were doing and how they were living they</text>
  <text start="269.02" dur="4.649">were not actually keeping Torah they</text>
  <text start="271.539" dur="4.261">many times we&amp;#39;re keeping a vain mixture</text>
  <text start="273.669" dur="4.921">of Jewish man-made religious traditions</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="4.32">and then portions of Torah much is the</text>
  <text start="278.59" dur="3.24">Christian world over the centuries up</text>
  <text start="280.12" dur="4.049">until now keep a vain mixture of</text>
  <text start="281.83" dur="4.619">Christian Greek platonic man-made</text>
  <text start="284.169" dur="4.891">traditions and philosophies along with</text>
  <text start="286.449" dur="4.891">portions of the Torah such half-hearted</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="4.259">obedience is promised to bring curses</text>
  <text start="291.34" dur="5.579">Yahweh said so in the book of</text>
  <text start="293.319" dur="5.85">Deuteronomy and indeed these curses came</text>
  <text start="296.919" dur="6.391">upon ancient Israel and has also come</text>
  <text start="299.169" dur="5.97">upon modern-day Christians keeping every</text>
  <text start="303.31" dur="4.229">jot and tittle of Torah is beneficial in</text>
  <text start="305.139" dur="5.221">every way for both the center and the</text>
  <text start="307.539" dur="4.321">st. in the case of the former the center</text>
  <text start="310.36" dur="3.72">is softened and broken and brought to</text>
  <text start="311.86" dur="4.14">Messiah in the case of the latter the</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="3.54">st. is drawn even closer to Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="316" dur="5.099">kept near Yahshua&amp;#39;s beating heart of</text>
  <text start="317.62" dur="6.21">love there are too many temptations too</text>
  <text start="321.099" dur="4.611">much darkness too many Devils to stay</text>
  <text start="323.83" dur="5.04">close to yah while rejecting Torah as</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="6.19">evil has increased so too does yadi Mar</text>
  <text start="328.87" dur="4.65">need even as early as 3500 years ago to</text>
  <text start="331.9" dur="4.56">remind us of our obligation to keep</text>
  <text start="333.52" dur="5.19">Torah if even mo che needed to keep</text>
  <text start="336.46" dur="4.259">Torah and he lived in a wilderness where</text>
  <text start="338.71" dur="4.049">there were very few influences to do</text>
  <text start="340.719" dur="4.35">evil and he was also declared to be the</text>
  <text start="342.759" dur="4.77">most humble man to have ever lived and</text>
  <text start="345.069" dur="5.13">how much more o Christian and messianic</text>
  <text start="347.529" dur="5.61">do we need to keep Torah who are</text>
  <text start="350.199" dur="7.83">surrounded by so many influences to do</text>
  <text start="353.139" dur="8.071">evil not keeping Torah brings a</text>
  <text start="358.029" dur="8.19">blindness a stubbornness a pride that</text>
  <text start="361.21" dur="7.379">only obedience of Torah can break how</text>
  <text start="366.219" dur="4.92">many others are blind and wretched and</text>
  <text start="368.589" dur="4.95">naked yet they think they are rich and</text>
  <text start="371.139" dur="5.131">mighty these are exactly the words that</text>
  <text start="373.539" dur="6.331">were penned to the laodicean church this</text>
  <text start="376.27" dur="8.609">is the reason why so many have hardened</text>
  <text start="379.87" dur="7.049">their hearts against Torah you it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="384.879" dur="4.38">so many people won&amp;#39;t even let it enter</text>
  <text start="386.919" dur="3.99">into their mind this device scripture</text>
  <text start="389.259" dur="4.171">after scripture defense after defense</text>
  <text start="390.909" dur="4.011">plea after plea many people continue to</text>
  <text start="393.43" dur="4.19">harden the hearts</text>
  <text start="394.92" dur="5.13">it is a shame for a view but knew the</text>
  <text start="397.62" dur="5.16">beauty and richness of Torah you would</text>
  <text start="400.05" dur="5.97">behold like many of those who do so now</text>
  <text start="402.78" dur="6.18">a panoramic view of Yahshua such a wide</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="5.34">and glorious view of our Messiah that</text>
  <text start="408.96" dur="5.37">your previous troilus ways would seem is</text>
  <text start="411.36" dur="6.6">but a dream a pale fuzzy and distant</text>
  <text start="414.33" dur="5.82">dream by comparison you know often times</text>
  <text start="417.96" dur="4.11">when I talk to my Christian friends I I</text>
  <text start="420.15" dur="4.62">make another comparison that fits in</text>
  <text start="422.07" dur="5.43">well with this teaching I talked about</text>
  <text start="424.77" dur="4.68">how modern and Christianity is sort of</text>
  <text start="427.5" dur="4.44">like maybe buying a happy meal at</text>
  <text start="429.45" dur="4.17">McDonald&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;ll fill you up that might</text>
  <text start="431.94" dur="4.82">even taste good but it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="433.62" dur="6.21">nutritional it&amp;#39;s pretty incomplete the</text>
  <text start="436.76" dur="5.11">Messianic Torah centered gospel in which</text>
  <text start="439.83" dur="4.11">we keep and obey the Johnson tells of</text>
  <text start="441.87" dur="5.46">Torah out of a love for Yahshua is like</text>
  <text start="443.94" dur="6.24">a six-course meal at a four-star</text>
  <text start="447.33" dur="6.63">restaurant where the silverware is</text>
  <text start="450.18" dur="7.32">polished the plates are clean and every</text>
  <text start="453.96" dur="6.96">morsel of food is exquisite this is the</text>
  <text start="457.5" dur="6.23">difference we really should not ignore</text>
  <text start="460.92" dur="5.7">Torah or the precepts found in Torah</text>
  <text start="463.73" dur="5.23">when Paul and the apostles quote Torah</text>
  <text start="466.62" dur="4.17">time and time again throughout the New</text>
  <text start="468.96" dur="4.86">Testament that 10 should tell us</text>
  <text start="470.79" dur="4.56">something it says that the tanakh the</text>
  <text start="473.82" dur="3.36">Torah and the prophets are very</text>
  <text start="475.35" dur="3.69">important and we&amp;#39;re very important to</text>
  <text start="477.18" dur="4.85">the early apostles so they should be</text>
  <text start="479.04" dur="5.82">just as if not more important to us</text>
  <text start="482.03" dur="5.05">keeping Torah truly does give us a</text>
  <text start="484.86" dur="6.03">better understanding a better view of</text>
  <text start="487.08" dur="5.61">who yah is these are not just mindless</text>
