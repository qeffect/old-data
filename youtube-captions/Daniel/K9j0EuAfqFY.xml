  <text start="2.76" dur="5.48">with tor restoration ministries it is</text>
  <text start="4.65" dur="8.369">the Sabbath day Saturday July the 22nd</text>
  <text start="8.24" dur="7.24">2017 and this is now part 10 of my 17</text>
  <text start="13.019" dur="5.461">part series reconciling the teachings of</text>
  <text start="15.48" dur="6.719">Messiah and Apostle Paul and this is</text>
  <text start="18.48" dur="6.059">first Timothy chapter 1 first Timothy</text>
  <text start="22.199" dur="5.58">chapter 1 and we&amp;#39;re just going to get</text>
  <text start="24.539" dur="6.601">right into it this is a passage again</text>
  <text start="27.779" dur="5.55">that has been sorely misunderstood by</text>
  <text start="31.14" dur="4.47">Christians because they think Paul</text>
  <text start="33.329" dur="4.441">saying that we no longer have anything</text>
  <text start="35.61" dur="3.48">to do with the law anymore so let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="37.77" dur="3.69">get right into it and see what he says</text>
  <text start="39.09" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re going to start in over start at</text>
  <text start="41.46" dur="4.829">the beginning of this chapter Paul an</text>
  <text start="44.1" dur="5.52">apostle of Yahshua HaMashiach by the</text>
  <text start="46.289" dur="5.281">commandment of yah our Savior and Adonai</text>
  <text start="49.62" dur="6.75">Yahshua HaMashiach which is our hope</text>
  <text start="51.57" dur="7.71">under Timothy my son in the faith grace</text>
  <text start="56.37" dur="6.06">mercy and peace from yah our Father and</text>
  <text start="59.28" dur="5.459">Yahshua HaMashiach our Adonai as I</text>
  <text start="62.43" dur="5.1">besought thee to abide still at Ephesus</text>
  <text start="64.739" dur="5.341">with when I went into Macedonia that</text>
  <text start="67.53" dur="4.92">thou mightest change charge some that</text>
  <text start="70.08" dur="4.2">they teach no other doctrine neither</text>
  <text start="72.45" dur="3.63">give heed to fables and endless</text>
  <text start="74.28" dur="4.56">genealogies which Minister questions</text>
  <text start="76.08" dur="5.579">rather than godly edifying which is in</text>
  <text start="78.84" dur="5.31">faith so do so fall making an emphasis</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="4.981">right right here that these people were</text>
  <text start="84.15" dur="4.02">not the Timothy was to encourage these</text>
  <text start="86.64" dur="4.439">people not to get involved with all</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="6.989">these sort of rabbit trails genealogies</text>
  <text start="91.079" dur="5.551">but to rather have edifying in faith now</text>
  <text start="95.159" dur="4.591">the end of the commandment is charity</text>
  <text start="96.63" dur="6.36">out of a pure heart and of a good</text>
  <text start="99.75" dur="5.28">conscience and a faith unfeigned so this</text>
  <text start="102.99" dur="5.19">is the whole point of the Torah right is</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="5.01">to that we&amp;#39;re to have love out of a pure</text>
  <text start="108.18" dur="5.18">heart we&amp;#39;ll have a good conscience a</text>
  <text start="110.04" dur="6.649">clean conscience and a faith unfeigned</text>
  <text start="113.36" dur="6.28">placing our absolute trust in Yahshua</text>
  <text start="116.689" dur="5.801">from which some having swerved have</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="3.96">turned aside unto vain jangling desiring</text>
  <text start="122.49" dur="3.32">to be the teachers of the law</text>
  <text start="123.6" dur="4.379">understanding neither what they say nor</text>
  <text start="125.81" dur="5.08">whereof they affirm</text>
  <text start="127.979" dur="4.201">okay so these guys were puffed up trying</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="2.64">to teach the law they didn&amp;#39;t really know</text>
  <text start="132.18" dur="1.98">how to do it they weren&amp;#39;t even keeping</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="3.45">it to begin with</text>
  <text start="134.16" dur="6.27">and so it was just leading to absolute</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="7.08">destruction verse eight but we know that</text>
  <text start="140.43" dur="5.61">the law is good if a man use it lawfully</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="4.74">now here&amp;#39;s where the hang-up comes down</text>
  <text start="146.04" dur="5.61">this is a verse nine knowing this that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.8" dur="3.93">the law the Torah is not made for a</text>
  <text start="151.65" dur="3.089">righteous man</text>
  <text start="152.73" dur="3.81">so right there Christians say look the</text>
  <text start="154.739" dur="3.481">tour is not made for a righteous man so</text>
  <text start="156.54" dur="3.24">if I&amp;#39;m righteous if I love Yahshua I</text>
  <text start="158.22" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t need a law is that really what</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="5.429">Paul saying let&amp;#39;s continue knowing this</text>
  <text start="163.5" dur="3.72">that the Torah is not made for a</text>
  <text start="165.209" dur="4.651">righteous man but for the lawless a</text>
  <text start="167.22" dur="5.43">disobedient for the ungodly and for</text>
  <text start="169.86" dur="5.58">sinners for unholy and profane for</text>
  <text start="172.65" dur="6.39">murderers of fathers and murderers of</text>
  <text start="175.44" dur="5.359">mothers for man&amp;#39;s layers for mongers for</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="5.1">them that defile themselves with mankind</text>
  <text start="180.799" dur="4.78">for men stealers for liars for perjured</text>
  <text start="184.14" dur="4.4">persons and if there be any other thing</text>
  <text start="185.579" dur="5.431">that is contrary to sound doctrine</text>
  <text start="188.54" dur="5.14">according to the glorious gospel of the</text>
  <text start="191.01" dur="5.849">blessed yah which was committed to my</text>
  <text start="193.68" dur="5.52">trust okay so what does Paul saying is</text>
  <text start="196.859" dur="5.22">Paul saying as many Christians interpret</text>
  <text start="199.2" dur="4.89">this passage is Paul saying okay so if</text>
  <text start="202.079" dur="3.66">you&amp;#39;re righteous if you love the Messiah</text>
  <text start="204.09" dur="5.28">then you no longer need the lock as it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="205.739" dur="5.161">only made for the wicked well that could</text>
  <text start="209.37" dur="3.959">not possibly be what he&amp;#39;s saying and</text>
  <text start="210.9" dur="5.45">here&amp;#39;s why so in the first few verses of</text>
  <text start="213.329" dur="9.301">this chapter Paul is encouraging Timothy</text>
  <text start="216.35" dur="9.219">to exhort his congregation to edifying</text>
  <text start="222.63" dur="5.52">in faith he&amp;#39;s telling Timothy to</text>
  <text start="225.569" dur="4.471">encourage them to have faith now how</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="5.72">does Paul to find faith if we go back to</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="7.009">Romans chapter 3 verse 30</text>
  <text start="233.87" dur="6.39">Paul says do we then make void the law</text>
  <text start="237.049" dur="6.601">or the Torah through faith yah forbid</text>
  <text start="240.26" dur="6.36">yay we established the Torah so if we</text>
  <text start="243.65" dur="4.86">have true biblical godly faith which is</text>
  <text start="246.62" dur="4.649">placing our absolute trust in him and</text>
  <text start="248.51" dur="5.25">results in us obeying him obeying His</text>
  <text start="251.269" dur="4.651">commandments obeying his law that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="253.76" dur="5.28">true faith is it establishes the law in</text>
  <text start="255.92" dur="4.65">our hearts so then so so obviously</text>
  <text start="259.04" dur="3.03">Paul&amp;#39;s not saying that a righteous man</text>
  <text start="260.57" dur="3.78">disregards a lot and of course we know</text>
  <text start="262.07" dur="3.75">this we know this from Hebrews 8 which</text>
  <text start="264.35" dur="3.39">talks about what the New Covenant is</text>
  <text start="265.82" dur="3.81">that he will place his laws as</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="3.51">Commandments inside our hearts and side</text>
  <text start="269.63" dur="5.31">our mind to give this an inward desire</text>
  <text start="271.25" dur="5.1">to now obey his commandments so what</text>
  <text start="274.94" dur="3.509">does Paul mean when he says the law is</text>
  <text start="276.35" dur="4.77">not made for a righteous man but for the</text>
  <text start="278.449" dur="5.821">lawless the only interpretation to</text>
  <text start="281.12" dur="4.68">reconcile Romans 3:30 to reconcile</text>
  <text start="284.27" dur="3.3">Hebrews 8 the only one possible</text>
  <text start="285.8" dur="5.429">interpretation of this passage is this</text>
  <text start="287.57" dur="7.469">Paul is saying that the purpose of the</text>
  <text start="291.229" dur="6.271">law in that it exposes sin and that it</text>
  <text start="295.039" dur="5.041">condemns and accuses those are in sin</text>
  <text start="297.5" dur="3.96">the purpose of the law that&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="300.08" dur="3.12">that&amp;#39;s not designed for righteous man</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="4.44">why because the righteous man is already</text>
  <text start="303.2" dur="4.469">obeying the law he&amp;#39;s had an inward</text>
  <text start="305.9" dur="3.81">change through the through the blood of</text>
  <text start="307.669" dur="4.261">Yahshua covering his sins through his</text>
  <text start="309.71" dur="4.35">spirit filling him that inward change</text>
  <text start="311.93" dur="4.739">now causes him to want to obey the law</text>
  <text start="314.06" dur="5.99">so the law is not made for him in the</text>
  <text start="316.669" dur="6.75">sense of accusing him of condemning him</text>
  <text start="320.05" dur="4.81">see in order for us to be able to repent</text>
  <text start="323.419" dur="5.131">of our sins we&amp;#39;ve got to be convinced</text>
  <text start="324.86" dur="5.369">that were guilty that we&amp;#39;ve broken the</text>
  <text start="328.55" dur="3.66">law that we&amp;#39;ve broken the Torah that</text>
  <text start="330.229" dur="5.101">were condemned otherwise we&amp;#39;ll have no</text>
  <text start="332.21" dur="4.53">need to seek for a savior and I know</text>
  <text start="335.33" dur="2.82">this very well when you when you go out</text>
  <text start="336.74" dur="3.959">preaching I mean you can say all you</text>
  <text start="338.15" dur="3.93">want how much Yahshua loves them but if</text>
  <text start="340.699" dur="2">they&amp;#39;re not convinced that they need a</text>
  <text start="342.08" dur="2.85">Savior</text>
  <text start="342.699" dur="4.84">but they&amp;#39;re not convinced that they need</text>
  <text start="344.93" dur="4.83">someone that that needs to redeem them</text>
  <text start="347.539" dur="4.141">from their sins then it&amp;#39;s useless so</text>
  <text start="349.76" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s where the law comes in the law</text>
  <text start="351.68" dur="4.41">says hey you&amp;#39;re guilty</text>
  <text start="353.15" dur="5.31">hey you committed this sin you&amp;#39;ve been a</text>
  <text start="356.09" dur="4.259">liar you&amp;#39;ve been an adulterer you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="358.46" dur="3.6">been or mongering you&amp;#39;ve been stealing</text>
  <text start="360.349" dur="4.351">you&amp;#39;ve been doing all these things and</text>
  <text start="362.06" dur="3.12">so the law is designed to convict and</text>
  <text start="364.7" dur="2.999">condemn</text>
  <text start="365.18" dur="5.13">that person so that they will then seek</text>
  <text start="367.699" dur="3.961">Yahshua the Savior who can lift off that</text>
  <text start="370.31" dur="3.3">condemnation just like we talked about</text>
  <text start="371.66" dur="3.96">last week in part 9</text>
  <text start="373.61" dur="5.13">he blots out that divorce that</text>
  <text start="375.62" dur="5.13">condemnation that curse the law so that</text>
  <text start="378.74" dur="3.959">then as it says in Hebrews 8 which we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="380.75" dur="4.139">going to go over in a future part here</text>
  <text start="382.699" dur="4.741">as it says in Hebrews 8 then he puts</text>
  <text start="384.889" dur="4.56">those laws and those Commandments inside</text>
  <text start="387.44" dur="4.849">us inside our hearts in our mind so that</text>
  <text start="389.449" dur="5.551">we now have an inward desire to obey Him</text>
  <text start="392.289" dur="8.011">so that would be a righteous man who</text>
  <text start="395" dur="8.25">truly has faith which again Romans 335</text>
  <text start="400.3" dur="6.31">establishes the lost faith establishes</text>
  <text start="403.25" dur="7.05">the Torah we want to obey His</text>
  <text start="406.61" dur="5.67">commandments and we know that we are</text>
  <text start="410.3" dur="4.08">keeping his Commandments if the results</text>
  <text start="412.28" dur="3.72">are having a pure heart of good</text>
  <text start="414.38" dur="3.78">conscience and a faith and thing now if</text>
  <text start="416" dur="5.639">we&amp;#39;re getting lost and vain jangling of</text>
  <text start="418.16" dur="5.729">you know what this word means or these</text>
  <text start="421.639" dur="4.141">genealogies or things like that and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="423.889" dur="4.021">just it&amp;#39;s just leading up to puffed up</text>
  <text start="425.78" dur="3.66">knowledge or to strife then we know that</text>
  <text start="427.91" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re not we&amp;#39;re not in the right spirit</text>
  <text start="429.44" dur="5.849">we&amp;#39;re not approaching this law correctly</text>
  <text start="431.57" dur="6.42">which is what was happening here but if</text>
  <text start="435.289" dur="5.25">we have a faith unfeigned if we have a</text>
  <text start="437.99" dur="4.23">pure heart if our hearts have truly been</text>
  <text start="440.539" dur="4.16">changed and that law now is within us</text>
  <text start="442.22" dur="5.669">and we&amp;#39;re naturally wanting to obey it</text>
  <text start="444.699" dur="7.71">then the law is not made for us in the</text>
  <text start="447.889" dur="14.15">sense of convicting us or accusing us</text>
  <text start="452.409" dur="12.671">see again the law the Torah it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.039" dur="5.141">beautiful and wonderful for those who</text>
  <text start="465.08" dur="4.709">love yeah whose hearts have been</text>
  <text start="467.18" dur="4.799">transformed and so they seek it to obey</text>
  <text start="469.789" dur="4.56">it to see okay how can I please my</text>
  <text start="471.979" dur="5.631">Messiah but for those who don&amp;#39;t love</text>
  <text start="474.349" dur="7.82">yash or the law is annoying irritating</text>
  <text start="477.61" dur="6.309">inconvenient it convicts it accuses and</text>
  <text start="482.169" dur="3.191">ultimately what it&amp;#39;s supposed to do is</text>
  <text start="483.919" dur="4.59">supposed to drive that person to say oh</text>
  <text start="485.36" dur="3.48">my gosh I need a Savior I nee I can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="488.509" dur="3.511">this</text>
  <text start="488.84" dur="5.36">I&amp;#39;m totally completely condemned I need</text>
  <text start="492.02" dur="4.29">you Yahshua and of course then you</text>
  <text start="494.2" dur="4">surrender your heart fully to him and</text>
  <text start="496.31" dur="3.69">then he fills you with his spirit and</text>
  <text start="498.2" dur="4.56">and he begins to show you how to obey</text>
  <text start="500" dur="6.99">Him and to love him and to keep his</text>
  <text start="502.76" dur="5.79">Commandments to grow in him so when Paul</text>
  <text start="506.99" dur="3.03">says that the law is not made for a</text>
  <text start="508.55" dur="3.33">righteous man but made for and then he</text>
  <text start="510.02" dur="5.88">lists all these sinners he&amp;#39;s simply</text>
  <text start="511.88" dur="7.77">saying that the laws intent of bringing</text>
  <text start="515.9" dur="5.519">an accusation showing a person his sin</text>
  <text start="519.65" dur="5.27">so that he&amp;#39;s driven to Savior is made</text>
  <text start="521.419" dur="7.051">for not the righteous but for the wicked</text>
  <text start="524.92" dur="5.29">but faith has Paul encourages Timmy to</text>
  <text start="528.47" dur="4.8">do and then if you continue on in the</text>
  <text start="530.21" dur="5.76">same chapter he says if all talking</text>
  <text start="533.27" dur="5.28">about himself he says in verse 16 how be</text>
  <text start="535.97" dur="4.74">it for this cause I obtained mercy that</text>
  <text start="538.55" dur="4.44">in me first Yahshua the Messiah might</text>
  <text start="540.71" dur="4.17">show forth all long-suffering for a</text>
  <text start="542.99" dur="4.23">pattern to them which should hereafter</text>
  <text start="544.88" dur="4.95">believe on him to everlasting to life</text>
  <text start="547.22" dur="5.28">everlasting now unto the king eternal</text>
  <text start="549.83" dur="4.58">immortal invisible the only wise job the</text>
  <text start="552.5" dur="4.35">honor and glory forever and ever remain</text>
  <text start="554.41" dur="4.18">this charted I committed unto the son</text>
  <text start="556.85" dur="4.38">Timothy according to the prophecies</text>
  <text start="558.59" dur="5.55">which went on before thee without by the</text>
  <text start="561.23" dur="5.07">mitos war a good warfare holding faith</text>
  <text start="564.14" dur="3.21">and a good conscience so he repeats that</text>
  <text start="566.3" dur="2.7">same phrase that he searched the</text>
  <text start="567.35" dur="3.93">beginning holding faith in a good</text>
  <text start="569" dur="5.37">conscience which some having put away</text>
  <text start="571.28" dur="6.06">concerning faith have made shipwreck so</text>
  <text start="574.37" dur="4.17">he repeats that same theme at the end of</text>
  <text start="577.34" dur="4.35">this chapter he does in the beginning</text>
  <text start="578.54" dur="6.57">that faith and again you know faith from</text>
  <text start="581.69" dur="5.97">Romans 3 30 did not make void the Torah</text>
  <text start="585.11" dur="5.01">but it establishes the tork establishes</text>
  <text start="587.66" dur="3.75">the commandments why does the righteous</text>
  <text start="590.12" dur="2.61">why is the law not made for the</text>
  <text start="591.41" dur="3.3">righteous man because that righteous man</text>
  <text start="592.73" dur="3.72">has the law in his heart and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="594.71" dur="5.52">wanting to keep it he&amp;#39;s wanting to obey</text>
  <text start="596.45" dur="6.06">it so that&amp;#39;s the only possible</text>
  <text start="600.23" dur="5.01">interpretation to reconcile Paul&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="602.51" dur="5.25">writings and again we have to remember</text>
