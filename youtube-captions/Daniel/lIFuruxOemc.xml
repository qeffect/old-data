  <text start="108.39" dur="3.42">before and September 14th is the</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="4.559">following Monday so that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="111.81" dur="5.55">interesting okay so now we have that</text>
  <text start="114.869" dur="6.6">seven-year pattern of crisises</text>
  <text start="117.36" dur="6.5">established I want to I want to map</text>
  <text start="121.469" dur="9.421">something out here</text>
  <text start="123.86" dur="17.19">and show some things so talked about in</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="13.65">my last video that 1967 when the Jews</text>
  <text start="141.05" dur="7.02">took back Jerusalem that was the last</text>
  <text start="144.54" dur="6.99">Jubilee and of course Jubilees happen</text>
  <text start="148.07" dur="5.35">every 50 years but the other thing that</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="4.86">happens is that there are seven year</text>
  <text start="153.42" dur="4.94">cycles from one Jubilee to the next and</text>
  <text start="156.39" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s seven of those seven year cycles</text>
  <text start="158.36" dur="7.05">49 years between from one Jubilee to the</text>
  <text start="161.79" dur="6.84">next which mimics the the seven-day</text>
  <text start="165.41" dur="5.829">cycle of the week from one shabbat to</text>
  <text start="168.63" dur="5.55">the next so you have a Jubilee and then</text>
  <text start="171.239" dur="5.931">what you have is you have this first</text>
  <text start="174.18" dur="2.99">period of seven</text>
  <text start="181.2" dur="11.039">and so you have the years you know 68 69</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="10.29">70 71 72 73 and 74 would be the shemitah</text>
  <text start="192.239" dur="5.311">or the Sabbath year so of course in this</text>
  <text start="195.69" dur="5.19">is the sixth year in the seven-year</text>
  <text start="197.55" dur="8.13">cycle this would be when the Arab oil</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="7.5">embargo crisis occurred right there so</text>
  <text start="205.68" dur="4.8">that was the first person our list that</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="6.71">I showed you on facebook so then you go</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="4.61">into the second set of seven years</text>
  <text start="218.13" dur="14.58">and so that&amp;#39;s the year 19 75 76 77 78 79</text>
  <text start="226.28" dur="10.06">80 and 81 and so of course in September</text>
  <text start="232.71" dur="8.7">of 1980s when we had the iran-iraq war</text>
  <text start="236.34" dur="6.87">start and so that&amp;#39;s again another six</text>
  <text start="241.41" dur="4.08">year in the seven-year cycle so we see a</text>
  <text start="243.21" dur="3.72">pattern it happens on the year before</text>
  <text start="245.49" dur="4.5">the shemitah year the year before the</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="5.78">seventh or Sabbath year these crisis has</text>
  <text start="249.99" dur="6.84">happened so we have the oil embargo 1973</text>
  <text start="252.71" dur="8.85">iran-iraq war by 1980 so then we go to</text>
  <text start="256.83" dur="4.73">the next pattern of seven years</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="11.73">19 82 83 84 85 86 and 87 and 88 is the</text>
  <text start="273.99" dur="5.97">Sabbath year so 87 of course is when we</text>
  <text start="275.94" dur="8.819">had black monday so again following on</text>
  <text start="279.96" dur="7.859">that sixth six-year in the cycle that</text>
  <text start="284.759" dur="6.72">was the Black Monday now we go to our</text>
  <text start="287.819" dur="5.491">force set of seven years this is all</text>
  <text start="291.479" dur="3.421">scriptural by the way if there are</text>
  <text start="293.31" dur="4.85">jubblies every 50 years and then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.9" dur="3.26">a period of seven years</text>
  <text start="300.86" dur="10.44">so now we start with the year nineteen</text>
  <text start="302.75" dur="11.879">89 90 91 92 93 94 and 95 is the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="5.01">year 94 there was a massive sell-off on</text>
  <text start="314.629" dur="4.56">the bond market it happened between</text>
  <text start="316.31" dur="5.639">january-september of 94 this was not</text>
  <text start="319.189" dur="4.921">really anything that impacted the world</text>
  <text start="321.949" dur="5.851">much and I think there&amp;#39;s a reason for</text>
  <text start="324.11" dur="6.72">that because this is the fourth the</text>
  <text start="327.8" dur="5.16">fourth one in the pattern and if you</text>
  <text start="330.83" dur="5.989">look at this as a menorah so if I draw a</text>
  <text start="332.96" dur="3.859">menorah up here</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="6.329">you got one two three and then four is</text>
  <text start="343.83" dur="4.92">the servant candle or the seventh Center</text>
  <text start="346.349" dur="4.19">candle which represents Yahshua so I</text>
  <text start="348.75" dur="3.93">think the reason why this fourth</text>
  <text start="350.539" dur="5.071">quote-unquote crisis didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="352.68" dur="6.049">affect much is because it was the</text>
  <text start="355.61" dur="5.2">servant candle it was the center candle</text>
  <text start="358.729" dur="4.12">but notice when we get into the fifth</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="4.38">set of seven years we get right back to</text>
  <text start="362.849" dur="5.31">hardcore crisises like we had in the</text>
  <text start="365.19" dur="6.379">first three so this was kind of like the</text>
  <text start="368.159" dur="3.41">quiet or seal our pots</text>
  <text start="373.58" dur="9.45">so now we start with the year nineteen</text>
  <text start="375.47" dur="10.319">ninety-six ninety-seven 98 99 2000 2001</text>
  <text start="383.03" dur="5.49">2002 of course I don&amp;#39;t need to tell you</text>
  <text start="385.789" dur="4.62">what happen in 2001 you had the</text>
  <text start="388.52" dur="3.269">September 11th attacks and the stock</text>
  <text start="390.409" dur="3.651">market plunge that happened a few days</text>
  <text start="391.789" dur="6.63">later when they reopen the stock market</text>
  <text start="394.06" dur="10.349">exchange and then we come to our final</text>
  <text start="398.419" dur="5.99">set of seven years in this 50 year cycle</text>
  <text start="405.55" dur="7.839">excuse me not our final set we have one</text>
  <text start="408.65" dur="7.04">two three four five six or six set so</text>
  <text start="413.389" dur="7.68">here we have two thousand three four</text>
  <text start="415.69" dur="8.08">five six seven two thousand eight and</text>
  <text start="421.069" dur="4.53">two thousand nine is the Sabbath here of</text>
  <text start="423.77" dur="5.519">course in 2008 was the financial</text>
  <text start="425.599" dur="8.94">meltdown that occurred where the stock</text>
  <text start="429.289" dur="8.16">market plunged 777 points so again we</text>
  <text start="434.539" dur="4.651">have some major crisis and are in our</text>
  <text start="437.449" dur="3.421">5th and then our six lon just like we</text>
  <text start="439.19" dur="4.62">had in our first three and then this one</text>
  <text start="440.87" dur="5.49">was a quiet one and then now excuse me</text>
  <text start="443.81" dur="4.889">so now we come to our final period of</text>
  <text start="446.36" dur="9.26">seven years to finish out the 50-year</text>
  <text start="448.699" dur="6.921">Jubilee cycle so now we have 2010</text>
  <text start="457.44" dur="9.48">11 12 13 14 2015 and 16 will be the</text>
  <text start="463.47" dur="5.34">shemitah year or the Sabbath year this</text>
  <text start="466.92" dur="3.15">is where Jonathan Cahn gets it wrong he</text>
  <text start="468.81" dur="3.77">says that this year is the shemitah year</text>
  <text start="470.07" dur="6.96">it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s the sixth year but again</text>
  <text start="472.58" dur="6.16">because it&amp;#39;s a six year all we have to</text>
  <text start="477.03" dur="5.88">do is look at history we see that since</text>
  <text start="478.74" dur="7.8">the Jubilee of 1967 we&amp;#39;ve had major</text>
  <text start="482.91" dur="6.41">global crisis on every six year arab oil</text>
  <text start="486.54" dur="5.52">embargo infected the entire world</text>
  <text start="489.32" dur="4.24">iran-iraq war affected the entire world</text>
  <text start="492.06" dur="6.21">and that was the longest conventional</text>
  <text start="493.56" dur="6.51">war of the 20th century the Black Monday</text>
  <text start="498.27" dur="6.69">stock market crash affected the whole</text>
  <text start="500.07" dur="7.32">world we had the bond market sell-off</text>
  <text start="504.96" dur="5.64">which again was a quiet kind of a quiet</text>
  <text start="507.39" dur="5.16">thing September 11 2001 that of course</text>
  <text start="510.6" dur="4.05">affected the whole world financial</text>
  <text start="512.55" dur="3.96">crisis of 2008 affected the whole world</text>
  <text start="514.65" dur="5.85">so now we come to this one and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="516.51" dur="6.6">know what&amp;#39;s going to happen but this of</text>
  <text start="520.5" dur="3.51">course will be in September so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.11" dur="3.51">always been in september-october</text>
  <text start="524.01" dur="6.57">depending on when a little 29 which is</text>
  <text start="526.62" dur="7.23">the final day of six month a little 29</text>
  <text start="530.58" dur="7.53">or a little 30 so and then of course</text>
  <text start="533.85" dur="6.92">when we get to the year 2017 we come to</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="2.66">the next Jubilee</text>
  <text start="543.23" dur="5.19">so definitely looking at this pattern</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="3.52">happens on the six year it makes sense</text>
  <text start="548.42" dur="3.23">it would happen on the sixth year</text>
  <text start="549.89" dur="4.56">because six remembers the number of man</text>
  <text start="551.65" dur="4.24">so you would think that a crisis would</text>
  <text start="554.45" dur="3.24">happen on the six-year not on the</text>
  <text start="555.89" dur="4.14">Sabbath or shemitah year is jonathan</text>
  <text start="557.69" dur="5.94">cahn wrongly calculates but on the six</text>
  <text start="560.03" dur="5.4">year you see these crisises so just</text>
  <text start="563.63" dur="5.25">judging things off history we should</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="5.4">definitely see a major crisis on the six</text>
  <text start="568.88" dur="4.26">year that will affect the entire world</text>
  <text start="570.83" dur="4.38">and I believe it&amp;#39;ll be the crisis that</text>
  <text start="573.14" dur="6.72">will lead into the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="575.21" dur="7.23">that will start here and this is also</text>
  <text start="579.86" dur="4.62">the seventh the seventh one which is I</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="4.44">think very important and has a lot of</text>
  <text start="584.48" dur="3.84">significance and I think that that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="586.88" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;ll be the biggest one of all these</text>
  <text start="588.32" dur="7.82">previous six all right shabbat shalom</text>
  <text start="591.8" dur="4.34">websites spirit and torrid calm</text>
