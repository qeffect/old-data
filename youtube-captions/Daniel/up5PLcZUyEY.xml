  <text start="12.84" dur="2.249">may be thinking I&amp;#39;ve been thinking</text>

  <text start="15.089" dur="7.291">a nice day to honor your mom and surely</text>
  <text start="17.34" dur="9.929">that can&amp;#39;t be wrong well in fact if you</text>
  <text start="22.38" dur="6.96">go to my website wwwspa- em and you</text>

  <text start="29.34" dur="4.739">article with the title mothers gotta</text>
  <text start="31.439" dur="6.001">stay if you click on that article that I</text>
  <text start="34.079" dur="6.121">wrote a few years back i have a link</text>
  <text start="37.44" dur="5.34">actually in the body of the article and</text>
  <text start="40.2" dur="3.69">the link is not written by a messianic</text>
  <text start="42.78" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s not written by a Christian it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="43.89" dur="6.03">just written by a secular non-believer</text>
  <text start="46.62" dur="7.68">and what the author does is pretty much</text>
  <text start="49.92" dur="5.729">show the roots of Mother&amp;#39;s Day now she</text>
  <text start="54.3" dur="3.66">does it in such a way that you know she</text>
  <text start="55.649" dur="4.14">thinks it&amp;#39;s fine it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s cool but in</text>
  <text start="57.96" dur="3.54">fact if you start reading about the</text>
  <text start="59.789" dur="3.991">origins of mothers day you find out that</text>
  <text start="61.5" dur="6.45">it arose way way way back in the seventh</text>
  <text start="63.78" dur="6.03">century BCE 700 years before Christ when</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="4.38">the Greeks wanted to honor the goddess</text>
  <text start="69.81" dur="5.28">Gaia and if you&amp;#39;ve never heard of Gaia</text>
  <text start="72.33" dur="4.89">Gaia is sort of where we get the mother</text>
  <text start="75.09" dur="4.02">earth from that whole pagan concept of</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="3.06">worshipping the earth and of course the</text>
  <text start="79.11" dur="3.869">scripture talks about that that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="80.28" dur="5.6">not supposed to worship the creation but</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="6.331">rather the Creator behind the creation</text>
  <text start="85.88" dur="5.59">so basically it originated in Greece</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="4.23">they wanted to honor Gaia Gaia had this</text>
  <text start="91.47" dur="4.89">in pagan mythology Gaia had this</text>
  <text start="93.54" dur="4.649">daughter that they also started honoring</text>
  <text start="96.36" dur="5.399">and venerating and it became this</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="5.21">three-day festival in spring where there</text>
  <text start="101.759" dur="3.75">was a lot of entertainment a lot of</text>
  <text start="103.399" dur="4.841">festivities people would bring gifts to</text>
  <text start="105.509" dur="4.591">honor their mother and that&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="5.79">where mothers day came from so it had</text>
  <text start="110.1" dur="5.67">very very pagan roots now besides</text>
  <text start="114.03" dur="3.54">quoting the usual scripture that I bring</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="3.36">up whenever I talk about different pagan</text>
  <text start="117.57" dur="3.45">holidays like valentine&amp;#39;s day and</text>
  <text start="119.13" dur="3.269">halloween which of course is the</text>
  <text start="121.02" dur="3.959">scripture that i normally quote which is</text>
  <text start="122.399" dur="4.11">in jeremiah 10 about how yahweh says not</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="4.291">to have anything to do with with the</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="4.14">heathen leaving that aside there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.27" dur="2.82">another scripture actually in the New</text>
  <text start="130.649" dur="3.961">Testament</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="5.3">and it&amp;#39;s in the book of Matthew and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="134.61" dur="7.17">in chapter 15 the first six verses and</text>
  <text start="137.39" dur="6.22">it&amp;#39;s a very curious passage that I think</text>
  <text start="141.78" dur="5.73">there&amp;#39;s a lot of significance to this</text>
  <text start="143.61" dur="5.129">this particular pagan day and when you</text>
  <text start="147.51" dur="2.91">read it I think you&amp;#39;ll be very instantly</text>
  <text start="148.739" dur="5.521">familiar but it&amp;#39;s the part of scripture</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="7.289">where Yahshua is sort of talking about</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="6.509">this very evil custom that the Pharisees</text>
  <text start="157.709" dur="5.731">had developed or basically what happened</text>
  <text start="160.769" dur="5.791">was if you said anything evil or bad or</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="5.43">you cursed your parents you could offer</text>
  <text start="166.56" dur="3.78">Corbin and what that meant was is that</text>
  <text start="168.87" dur="4.5">you could basically come to the temple</text>
  <text start="170.34" dur="6.57">on a particular day you could offer gold</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="6.54">or money and if you did that it would be</text>
  <text start="176.91" dur="4.049">it would basically remove the curses or</text>
  <text start="179.91" dur="3.15">the bad things you said about your</text>
  <text start="180.959" dur="4.17">parents and that way you wouldn&amp;#39;t be in</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="3.33">violation of the one of the ten</text>
  <text start="185.129" dur="4.561">commandments which is to honor your</text>
  <text start="186.39" dur="5.67">father and your mother so this was</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="4.079">something that people would do and just</text>
  <text start="192.06" dur="4.11">to get off of you know cursing their</text>
  <text start="193.769" dur="3.84">parents and I think that in a lot of</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="3.149">ways sort of relates to mothers day</text>
  <text start="197.609" dur="4.021">because you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of people</text>
  <text start="199.319" dur="3.991">out there who you know though they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="201.63" dur="3.75">speak bad of their parents or they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ll curse them all or do bad things</text>
  <text start="205.38" dur="4.77">of say bad things about them but then</text>
  <text start="207.63" dur="4.38">they sort of don&amp;#39;t feel as guilty</text>
  <text start="210.15" dur="3.059">because then one day out of the year or</text>
  <text start="212.01" dur="2.819">two days of the year mother&amp;#39;s day and</text>
  <text start="213.209" dur="3.03">father&amp;#39;s day you know they&amp;#39;ll go out of</text>
  <text start="214.829" dur="3.391">their way to send them their parents a</text>
  <text start="216.239" dur="3.9">card or a gift or take them out to</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="3.329">dinner or something and that&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="220.139" dur="2.581">the modern-day equivalent of what the</text>
  <text start="221.549" dur="3.181">Pharisees were doing to sort of get</text>
  <text start="222.72" dur="4.079">around that commandment the fact is</text>
  <text start="224.73" dur="3.42">according to Scripture every day should</text>
  <text start="226.799" dur="3.481">be mother&amp;#39;s day and every day should be</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="3.239">Father&amp;#39;s Day not in the pagan sense but</text>
  <text start="230.28" dur="3.51">in the sense that were to honor our</text>
  <text start="231.389" dur="5.13">parents even if our parents are not</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="5.94">believers or if they&amp;#39;re mistreating you</text>
  <text start="236.519" dur="5.011">or they&amp;#39;re not being good people you</text>
  <text start="239.73" dur="4.319">still have an obligation to honor them</text>
  <text start="241.53" dur="4.799">to not speak ill of them to not go</text>
  <text start="244.049" dur="4.351">around talking to other people about you</text>
  <text start="246.329" dur="4.861">know how bad your parents are to pray</text>
  <text start="248.4" dur="5.699">for them and to do all you can to honor</text>
  <text start="251.19" dur="5.579">them and venerate them and to to uphold</text>
  <text start="254.099" dur="3.871">them because that particular commandment</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="3">of honoring your father and mother</text>
  <text start="257.97" dur="4.45">actually has a blessing attached to it</text>
  <text start="259.769" dur="4.451">and that is if you honor your parents</text>
  <text start="262.42" dur="4.02">as the scripture says you will be</text>
  <text start="264.22" dur="4.08">blessed with a long life and your days</text>
  <text start="266.44" dur="5.31">will be extended in the land that Yahweh</text>
  <text start="268.3" dur="5.49">gives you so if you want a long life and</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="3.9">you want a blessed life then you need to</text>
  <text start="273.79" dur="3.93">make sure that you always honor your</text>
  <text start="275.65" dur="3.6">parents and again I&amp;#39;ve met some</text>
  <text start="277.72" dur="3.3">Christians who say well my parents</text>
  <text start="279.25" dur="2.82">aren&amp;#39;t believers so I don&amp;#39;t have to you</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="2.94">know I don&amp;#39;t have to say good things</text>
  <text start="282.07" dur="3.78">about them well that&amp;#39;s not true whether</text>
  <text start="283.96" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re believers are not you still have</text>
  <text start="285.85" dur="3.33">to honor them you still have to venerate</text>
  <text start="287.29" dur="3.3">them doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have to agree with</text>
  <text start="289.18" dur="4.47">their lifestyle it doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have</text>
  <text start="290.59" dur="4.23">to agree with what they&amp;#39;re doing but you</text>
  <text start="293.65" dur="5.73">do need to make sure that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="6.45">speaking good of them so just say no to</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="4.67">mothers day again you can go to that</text>

  <text start="307.03" dur="5.31">about where this festival came from its</text>
  <text start="309.61" dur="4.62">pagan roots and I think that upon</text>
  <text start="312.34" dur="3.99">considering at reading about it you&amp;#39;ll</text>
