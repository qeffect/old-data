  <text start="96.78" dur="6.36">Nehemiah chapter why now this as I went</text>
  <text start="99.06" dur="7.26">over in my teaching several days ago</text>
  <text start="103.14" dur="6.03">about the seventy weeks of Daniel we</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="6.24">know Nehemiah 1 &amp;amp; tues where the decree</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="5.19">is finally issued for DMI to go and</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="3.599">rebuild the city not just the temple but</text>
  <text start="114.36" dur="4.079">the actual city of Jerusalem this is</text>
  <text start="116.159" dur="6.39">actually when the seventy weeks of</text>
  <text start="118.439" dur="7.651">Daniel begins so as it was prophesied in</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="5.761">Daniel 9 and if we go to Nehemiah one</text>
  <text start="126.09" dur="5.43">starting in verse 1 it says the words of</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="4.19">Nehemiah the son of hockey Leah and it</text>
  <text start="131.52" dur="3.08">came to pass</text>
  <text start="132.5" dur="6.06">in the month of Kislev we know the kids</text>
  <text start="134.6" dur="5.79">lever was a ninth month you can verify</text>

  <text start="144.68" dur="6.56">nehemiah one is that basically nehemiah</text>
  <text start="147.68" dur="5.94">is a very sad because he hears about how</text>
  <text start="151.24" dur="4.719">you know there was a wave that had gone</text>
  <text start="153.62" dur="5.25">to rebuild the temple several years</text>
  <text start="155.959" dur="4.771">earlier under artaxerxes who took the</text>
  <text start="158.87" dur="4.77">name of cyrus the greatest grandfather</text>

  <text start="166.489" dur="3.631">they&amp;#39;d gotten persecuted there were a</text>
  <text start="167.87" dur="4.2">lot of enemies around Judea that tried</text>
  <text start="170.12" dur="3.839">to discourage them so everything was in</text>

  <text start="177.5" dur="4.26">the temple and and things were in</text>

  <text start="298.64" dur="6.93">the first seven weeks of Daniel because</text>
  <text start="303.919" dur="3.391">Nehemiah was given this decree to</text>
  <text start="305.57" dur="3.81">rebuild the city and to continue the</text>
  <text start="307.31" dur="3.81">work of the temple and then about 49</text>

  <text start="1451.63" dur="6.63">actually happened during handled i think</text>
  <text start="1453.52" dur="6.51">oh yeah it&amp;#39;s good but but from what my</text>
  <text start="1458.26" dur="3.78">understanding is here and mess up now</text>
  <text start="1460.03" dur="4.86">the time on the night that yah showed me</text>
  <text start="1462.04" dur="5.37">his ways been saying from way back then</text>
  <text start="1464.89" dur="4.26">because you know he&amp;#39;s recounting all</text>

  <text start="1469.15" dur="5.34">the blasting of hail mildew all the</text>
  <text start="1471.73" dur="5.19">stuff and he&amp;#39;s saying and in fact go</text>
  <text start="1474.49" dur="4.05">back to verse 15 consider from this day</text>

  <text start="1478.54" dur="5.22">was laid upon a stone the temple of</text>
  <text start="1480.25" dur="5.88">Yahweh so he&amp;#39;s taught he&amp;#39;s referencing a</text>
  <text start="1483.76" dur="3.78">day not necessarily the day that the</text>
  <text start="1486.13" dur="3.69">wrong he&amp;#39;s referencing the day for</text>
  <text start="1487.54" dur="7.83">remember way back before the temple was</text>
  <text start="1489.82" dur="7.08">even laid okay and you guys first got</text>
  <text start="1495.37" dur="4.19">back here from your that least that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1496.9" dur="2.66">how I&amp;#39;m reading it</text>
  <text start="1502.94" dur="5.55">this then I for the throne yeah I think</text>
  <text start="1505.55" dur="4.71">I see that yeah he&amp;#39;s bringing up to</text>
  <text start="1508.49" dur="4.02">dates like in verse 15 he says consider</text>
  <text start="1510.26" dur="4.02">from this day and upward so this 24th</text>
  <text start="1512.51" dur="3.93">not day of the ninth month and then also</text>
  <text start="1514.28" dur="3.9">is considering and from before a stone</text>
  <text start="1516.44" dur="4.05">was laid upon us from the temple which</text>
  <text start="1518.18" dur="4.62">is way back in 486 bc when i first got</text>
  <text start="1520.49" dur="4.11">back to our seven-year exile says since</text>
  <text start="1522.8" dur="3.36">those days you know you guys have had</text>
  <text start="1524.6" dur="3.51">troubles and struggles and we know about</text>
  <text start="1526.16" dur="3.6">that because you read as renea minded</text>
  <text start="1528.11" dur="2.67">see all the struggles and my troubles</text>
  <text start="1529.76" dur="3.96">that they have of all the surrounding</text>
  <text start="1530.78" dur="4.77">cable and you know we read about them</text>
  <text start="1533.72" dur="4.14">being spit with blasting and mildew</text>
  <text start="1535.55" dur="4.53">inhale labor and all this stuff and then</text>
  <text start="1537.86" dur="4.89">it says i don&amp;#39;t agree we thought that</text>
  <text start="1540.08" dur="6.93">i&amp;#39;m just saying that my as far as i</text>
  <text start="1542.75" dur="7.74">recall his last last year we did it I I</text>
  <text start="1547.01" dur="6.45">thought we did get him you didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1550.49" dur="5.94">study with without all these dates right</text>
  <text start="1553.46" dur="5.85">and that was a different understanding</text>
  <text start="1556.43" dur="4.73">we got what it relates to Yahshua well</text>
  <text start="1559.31" dur="4.23">yeah I said remember when they said</text>
  <text start="1561.16" dur="5.11">something before greater than the temple</text>
  <text start="1563.54" dur="9.18">stands before you because he&amp;#39;s he you</text>
  <text start="1566.27" dur="8.19">know he he he&amp;#39;s yeah and my we know and</text>
  <text start="1572.72" dur="6.44">we understood it during Hanukkah was</text>
  <text start="1574.46" dur="7.44">when he was conceived actually right so</text>
  <text start="1579.16" dur="4.84">am I understand where this maybe I</text>
  <text start="1581.9" dur="3.93">misunderstood and that&amp;#39;s the study week</text>
  <text start="1584" dur="4.56">last year I thought it relates to where</text>
  <text start="1585.83" dur="7.17">haga actually makes a reference to</text>
  <text start="1588.56" dur="7.2">Joshua&amp;#39;s conception rather than I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1593" dur="4.92">know but all I know I don&amp;#39;t end the</text>
  <text start="1595.76" dur="3.57">template revealed by named Maya but they</text>
  <text start="1597.92" dur="2.97">have a connection I don&amp;#39;t know i don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1599.33" dur="3.36">see yash with conception anywhere in</text>
  <text start="1600.89" dur="4.32">Haggai but what I do see very clearly in</text>
  <text start="1602.69" dur="3.66">verse 18 is consider now from this day</text>
  <text start="1605.21" dur="2.73">not we&amp;#39;re good we&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="1606.35" dur="3.81">24th day the ninth month in the year</text>
  <text start="1607.94" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t know for 20 of you can see from</text>
  <text start="1610.16" dur="3.24">the day that the foundation of Yahweh&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1611.93" dur="3.72">temples late I know and that was that</text>
  <text start="1613.4" dur="3.9">was in 44 BC it was just after a couple</text>
  <text start="1615.65" dur="5.13">years after they got back from the Exile</text>
  <text start="1617.3" dur="6.42">um basically from that point till now</text>
  <text start="1620.78" dur="4.86">you&amp;#39;ve had all this hard this rough time</text>
  <text start="1623.72" dur="3.18">but from now on I&amp;#39;m going to bless you</text>
  <text start="1625.64" dur="3">and then we see the evidence that</text>
  <text start="1626.9" dur="5.43">history because those last four years</text>
  <text start="1628.64" dur="4.24">from 4 22 to 14 they you know they did</text>
  <text start="1632.33" dur="1.42">60</text>
  <text start="1632.88" dur="2.64">here&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying to give this</text>
  <text start="1633.75" dur="3.63">temple built a similar belton evolved he</text>
  <text start="1635.52" dur="4.14">struggles and then finally in four years</text>
  <text start="1637.38" dur="6.33">boom it&amp;#39;s done it&amp;#39;s completed it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1639.66" dur="5.79">it takes off the conception of Yash</text>
  <text start="1643.71" dur="3.69">ladies doing and actually this now</text>
  <text start="1645.45" dur="3.48">relates to the seven years since the</text>
  <text start="1647.4" dur="5.01">israel became a nation i just realized</text>
  <text start="1648.93" dur="5.19">in 1948 because you know since israel</text>
  <text start="1652.41" dur="3.27">became a nation 1948 they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1654.12" dur="3.36">struggling they&amp;#39;ve been in San they</text>
  <text start="1655.68" dur="3.6">haven&amp;#39;t pressed into yah you know</text>
  <text start="1657.48" dur="3.06">there&amp;#39;s been all this stuff but now in</text>
  <text start="1659.28" dur="2.79">these final four years you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1660.54" dur="3.21">see a quick work because you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1662.07" dur="3.72">see the son of perdition do its thing</text>
  <text start="1663.75" dur="5.73">you&amp;#39;re going to see his people purified</text>
  <text start="1665.79" dur="5.13">josh is going to return the this remnant</text>
  <text start="1669.48" dur="2.76">of the jews are going to repent you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1670.92" dur="2.88">going to see this quick work done in</text>
  <text start="1672.24" dur="3.33">these next four years or three and a</text>
  <text start="1673.8" dur="3.42">half years and it&amp;#39;s sort of grace</text>
  <text start="1675.57" dur="5.16">similar to here because you had no the</text>
  <text start="1677.22" dur="5.37">60-year period or whatever about from 46</text>
  <text start="1680.73" dur="6.54">to 422 where they&amp;#39;re struggling but then</text>
  <text start="1682.59" dur="7.35">the last four years they make it yeah</text>
  <text start="1687.27" dur="4.47">yeah yeah no different that the one the</text>
  <text start="1689.94" dur="4.02">one thing to clarify yeah Sean&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1691.74" dur="5.34">conception as far as i remember we work</text>
  <text start="1693.96" dur="5.04">it out from yom teruah going back nine</text>
  <text start="1697.08" dur="7.05">months which is the gestation period you</text>
  <text start="1699" dur="6.93">pretty much end up in Hanukkah I think</text>
  <text start="1704.13" dur="7.05">we even have an article on the side but</text>
  <text start="1705.93" dur="8.91">that at least is what i recall from the</text>
  <text start="1711.18" dur="5.91">hog is pleased i am and just just just</text>
  <text start="1714.84" dur="5.13">does not remember the children is that</text>
  <text start="1717.09" dur="5.01">it looks like from the year 44 to 48</text>
  <text start="1719.97" dur="4.11">team is about 66 years and then if you</text>
  <text start="1722.1" dur="4.47">had two more years on to go back to 46</text>
  <text start="1724.08" dur="5.13">and they officially okay back under</text>
  <text start="1726.57" dur="4.41">cyrus is about 68 years so you&amp;#39;re almost</text>
  <text start="1729.21" dur="5.33">talking about a period of 70 years</text>
  <text start="1730.98" dur="8.24">that&amp;#39;s like from the you know 1948 to</text>
  <text start="1734.54" dur="6.72">2017 so i think there&amp;#39;s definitely a</text>
  <text start="1739.22" dur="5.4">reflection there</text>
  <text start="1741.26" dur="5.6">and I&amp;#39;m gonna stop the recording Shalom</text>
