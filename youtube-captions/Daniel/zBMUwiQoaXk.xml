  <text start="3.5" dur="5.769">for those who are new to my channel I do</text>
  <text start="5.97" dur="4.86">a Sabbath hike every Shabbat every</text>
  <text start="9.269" dur="4.141">Sabbath which is always between Friday</text>
  <text start="10.83" dur="5.209">night and Saturday night showing the</text>
  <text start="13.41" dur="7.59">wonders and beauties of Alaska and</text>
  <text start="16.039" dur="7.08">talking about yeah and I wanted to bring</text>
  <text start="21" dur="4.05">up something that I really important</text>
  <text start="23.119" dur="4.301">because a lot of Christians don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="25.05" dur="5.549">understand this so when we talk in the</text>
  <text start="27.42" dur="5.159">New Testament about you know there being</text>
  <text start="30.599" dur="5.611">no Jew or Gentile that we&amp;#39;re all one in</text>
  <text start="32.579" dur="6">Christ that concept is in the Torah and</text>
  <text start="36.21" dur="5.009">a lot of Christians don&amp;#39;t know that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="38.579" dur="6.151">actually in several places but just just</text>
  <text start="41.219" dur="6.871">here&amp;#39;s just one example it&amp;#39;s a numbers</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="6.21">chapter 15 verse 15 just get this</text>
  <text start="48.09" dur="5.84">situated here I&amp;#39;m sorry I gotta it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="50.94" dur="2.99">hard for me to hold everything</text>
  <text start="58.61" dur="3.48">[Applause]</text>
  <text start="62.8" dur="3.88">again this is just one example you can</text>
  <text start="65.059" dur="8.191">actually find this all through the Torah</text>
  <text start="66.68" dur="13.98">but in numbers fifteen fifteen look what</text>
  <text start="73.25" dur="9.63">it says one ordinance shall be both for</text>
  <text start="80.66" dur="3.9">you of the congregation and also for the</text>
  <text start="82.88" dur="3.84">stranger that would be like the Gentile</text>
  <text start="84.56" dur="4.71">that so turns with you an ordinance</text>
  <text start="86.72" dur="5.07">forever in your generation as you are so</text>
  <text start="89.27" dur="5.73">shall the stranger be before Yahweh one</text>
  <text start="91.79" dur="5.7">law one Torah and one manner shall be</text>
  <text start="95" dur="5.97">for you and for the stranger</text>
  <text start="97.49" dur="6.769">that&amp;#39;s sojourn with you okay that phrase</text>
  <text start="100.97" dur="6.39">there should be one law one ordinance</text>
  <text start="104.259" dur="5.201">for both the native-born the Israelite</text>
  <text start="107.36" dur="4.23">and the stranger or the Gentile that</text>
  <text start="109.46" dur="5.909">phrase is all through the Torah and</text>
  <text start="111.59" dur="7.08">numbers 15 verses 15 and 16 is just one</text>
  <text start="115.369" dur="8.36">example why is my picture so blurry</text>
  <text start="118.67" dur="11.88">I guess that&amp;#39;s disappointing</text>
  <text start="123.729" dur="8.471">in any case if I get one sunlight so</text>
  <text start="130.55" dur="4.05">that concept of there always being one</text>
  <text start="132.2" dur="4.71">Torah for both the Gentile and the Jew</text>
  <text start="134.6" dur="4.05">the Gentile and the Israelite that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="136.91" dur="3.36">through Torah so there was never</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="3.51">supposed to be a division between those</text>
  <text start="140.27" dur="4.74">Gentiles who wanted to become part of</text>
  <text start="142.16" dur="5.43">Israel whose were really sought to walk</text>
  <text start="145.01" dur="4.47">and covenant and the Israelite people</text>
  <text start="147.59" dur="4.05">they were basically all considered</text>
  <text start="149.48" dur="4.17">Israelites right</text>
  <text start="151.64" dur="5.34">remember Rahab the harlot she was a</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="5.73">Gentile ruth the moabite as&amp;#39; was a</text>
  <text start="156.98" dur="5.79">gentile these both of these women are in</text>
  <text start="159.38" dur="5.61">the line that eventually led to Miriam</text>
  <text start="162.77" dur="4.049">and Josef and of course Miriam was</text>
  <text start="164.99" dur="4.68">overshadowed by the ruach ha&amp;#39;qodesh the</text>
  <text start="166.819" dur="6.811">Holy Spirit and gave birth to Yahshua</text>
  <text start="169.67" dur="7.86">while she was yet still a virgin so so</text>
  <text start="173.63" dur="7.02">it was always this way so the reason why</text>
  <text start="177.53" dur="5.88">Paul and Yahshua and and yaa had to</text>
  <text start="180.65" dur="4.53">reveal the Peter in acts 10 about how</text>
  <text start="183.41" dur="5.43">the Gentiles could be filled the Holy</text>
  <text start="185.18" dur="5.67">Spirit they were just reminding what the</text>
  <text start="188.84" dur="4.86">Torah actually taught but again by the</text>
  <text start="190.85" dur="4.59">first century the first century Jews had</text>
  <text start="193.7" dur="4.38">become so lost in their Talmud</text>
  <text start="195.44" dur="4.14">which came from Babylon which had a lot</text>
  <text start="198.08" dur="3.21">of manmade traditions that had nothing</text>
  <text start="199.58" dur="5.64">to do with the written tour of Moses</text>
  <text start="201.29" dur="6.42">that they had separated that the Jews</text>
  <text start="205.22" dur="3.41">and the Gentiles they&amp;#39;d put this wall of</text>
  <text start="207.71" dur="3.66">partition up</text>
  <text start="208.63" dur="4.66">well that wall partition did not exist</text>
  <text start="211.37" dur="4.11">in the Torah given to Moses as you can</text>
  <text start="213.29" dur="5.7">see in numbers 15 15 and 16 it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="215.48" dur="5.52">exist but it had been reelected and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.99" dur="3.15">been reacted by Christians today saying</text>
  <text start="221" dur="3.57">there&amp;#39;s a difference between Jews and</text>
  <text start="222.14" dur="4.68">Gentiles it&amp;#39;s been erected by Jews</text>
  <text start="224.57" dur="3.84">modern-day tombow to Jews who make a</text>
  <text start="226.82" dur="4.47">difference between there&amp;#39;s gonna be no</text>
  <text start="228.41" dur="4.68">difference basically numbers 15 and 15</text>
  <text start="231.29" dur="3.84">and 16 goes along with exodus 12 which</text>
  <text start="233.09" dur="4.59">goes along with Ephesians 2 in the New</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="4.8">Testament which says that any human</text>
  <text start="237.68" dur="4.5">being on the planet whether you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="239.93" dur="3.93">George Gentile if you are covered in the</text>
  <text start="242.18" dur="4.14">blood of Yahshua the Jewish Messiah</text>
  <text start="243.86" dur="4.08">Jesus Christ of Nazareth then you are</text>
  <text start="246.32" dur="4.62">you could be grafted in to the</text>
  <text start="247.94" dur="6.12">Commonwealth of Israel and then all the</text>
  <text start="250.94" dur="5.25">commandments all the commandments given</text>
  <text start="254.06" dur="5.549">to Israel are not given to you no matter</text>
  <text start="256.19" dur="6.69">where you were born what gender what</text>
  <text start="259.609" dur="3.991">race doesn&amp;#39;t matter you&amp;#39;re considered an</text>
  <text start="262.88" dur="2.64">Israelite</text>
  <text start="263.6" dur="3.62">once you&amp;#39;re grafted in to the</text>
  <text start="265.52" dur="5.73">Commonwealth of Israel by the blood of</text>
  <text start="267.22" dur="8.95">of Jesus of Yahshua so that&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.25" dur="7.59">always been in the Torah it is people</text>
  <text start="276.17" dur="4.59">who follow the traditions of men whether</text>
  <text start="278.84" dur="3.72">it be modern day Christians or first</text>
  <text start="280.76" dur="4.59">century Kemetic Jews or modern-day</text>
  <text start="282.56" dur="8.73">Talmudic Jews that have erected that</text>
  <text start="285.35" dur="9.86">wall of partition hallelujah hallelujah</text>
  <text start="291.29" dur="6.09">oh it&amp;#39;s so beautiful</text>
  <text start="295.21" dur="3.91">sorry the picture so blurry I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="297.38" dur="3.96">why it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s I guess there&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="299.12" dur="4.17">enough I mean there&amp;#39;s full sunlight so I</text>
  <text start="301.34" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;m like it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="303.29" dur="4.97">disappointing it&amp;#39;s really disappointing</text>
  <text start="306.59" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s so blurry</text>
  <text start="308.26" dur="9.07"> there should be a lot more clarity</text>
  <text start="310.46" dur="8.81">on on on my camera it might be I might</text>
  <text start="317.33" dur="3.87">need to clean the camera I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="319.27" dur="4.87">maybe it&amp;#39;s time for me to get a new</text>
  <text start="321.2" dur="4.5">phone that might be what&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="324.14" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s time for</text>
  <text start="325.7" dur="6.54">hallelujah I also wanted to explain you</text>
  <text start="329.96" dur="4.62">know that Galatians teaching I reposted</text>
  <text start="332.24" dur="6.24">today was something I recorded on June</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="5.67">17th 2017 I just noticed 1717 when every</text>
  <text start="338.48" dur="3.63">time accorded a but when I reposted it</text>
  <text start="340.25" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s a few of mine that&amp;#39;s the seventh</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="2.88">part of a seventeen part series so</text>
  <text start="343.94" dur="3.42">there&amp;#39;s gonna be something you may not</text>
  <text start="344.99" dur="6.66">understand for instance when I talk</text>
  <text start="347.36" dur="7.29">about the circumcision of Moses I go</text>
  <text start="351.65" dur="6.39">into that that&amp;#39;s what they believed the</text>
  <text start="354.65" dur="6.63">body of rules and regulations that they</text>
  <text start="358.04" dur="4.59">theorized came from Moses but actually</text>
  <text start="361.28" dur="4.11">had nothing to do with the Torah</text>
  <text start="362.63" dur="3.99">actually given to Moses so the Jews of</text>
  <text start="365.39" dur="3.12">the first century what they would do is</text>
  <text start="366.62" dur="3.51">they would take the written words of</text>
  <text start="368.51" dur="3.81">Moses which are good those came from yah</text>
  <text start="370.13" dur="4.83">and then they mix them with this oral</text>
  <text start="372.32" dur="4.68">traditions and and laws that they refer</text>
  <text start="374.96" dur="4.41">to as the quote-unquote circumcision of</text>
  <text start="377" dur="3.45">Moses or what they theorized came from</text>
  <text start="379.37" dur="4.01">Moses which were all these man-made</text>
  <text start="380.45" dur="4.8">traditions that contradict the Torah</text>
  <text start="383.38" dur="3.82">circumcision the actual law of</text>
  <text start="385.25" dur="5.37">circumcision to remove the foreskin from</text>
  <text start="387.2" dur="5.01">a baby boy eight days old that did not</text>
  <text start="390.62" dur="4.65">come from Moses that came from Abraham</text>
  <text start="392.21" dur="5.85">yah gave that to Abraham so whenever you</text>
  <text start="395.27" dur="4.59">see the circumcision of Moses that is</text>
  <text start="398.06" dur="4.62">referring it&amp;#39;s a colloquialism referring</text>
  <text start="399.86" dur="5.07">to all the Talmudic man-made traditions</text>
  <text start="402.68" dur="4.59">that the Jews theorized and speculated</text>
  <text start="404.93" dur="3.48">came for Moses but they really did it</text>
  <text start="407.27" dur="2.49">was just their way of trying to mix</text>
  <text start="408.41" dur="4.29">their own man-made traditions in with</text>
  <text start="409.76" dur="5.04">the actual Torah removing the foreskin</text>
  <text start="412.7" dur="5.4">from a baby boy eight days of old age is</text>
  <text start="414.8" dur="6.75">very good it prevents infection it</text>
  <text start="418.1" dur="5.79">actually is a symbol of the inward</text>
  <text start="421.55" dur="4.23">circumcision of the heart that every man</text>
  <text start="423.89" dur="5.3">and woman for that matter should have</text>
  <text start="425.78" dur="3.41">when they repent and turn to the Messiah</text>
  <text start="430.81" dur="5.22">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very similar to like water</text>
  <text start="433.43" dur="5.04">baptism a mikvah it&amp;#39;s an outward outward</text>
  <text start="436.03" dur="2.92">demonstration of an inward change of</text>
  <text start="438.47" dur="2.61">heart</text>
  <text start="438.95" dur="4.71">the reason it&amp;#39;s done in eight days old</text>
  <text start="441.08" dur="4.17">is because by eight days the blood</text>
  <text start="443.66" dur="4.5">platelets have formed enough so that</text>
  <text start="445.25" dur="5.49">when you cut the foreskin off a baby he</text>
  <text start="448.16" dur="6.62">won&amp;#39;t bleed excessively so you wait till</text>
  <text start="450.74" dur="6.02">the eighth day to circumcise a boy</text>
  <text start="454.78" dur="5.69">and of course you never circumcised a</text>
  <text start="456.76" dur="10.74">girl that&amp;#39;s a wicked devilish Muslim</text>
  <text start="460.47" dur="10.72">tradition hallelujah hallelujah it&amp;#39;s so</text>
