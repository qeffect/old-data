  <text start="16.56" dur="5.52">tomorrow and the next day we have the</text>

  <text start="22.08" dur="4.89">happens on the 14th and 15th day of Adar</text>
  <text start="24.689" dur="5.51">of course you can read about the entire</text>
  <text start="26.97" dur="6.78">story of Purim in the book of Esther I</text>
  <text start="30.199" dur="6.401">came out with an article and a video on</text>
  <text start="33.75" dur="5.25">Purim last year I&amp;#39;ll provide links in</text>
  <text start="36.6" dur="4.35">the video to those from last year and</text>
  <text start="39" dur="3.48">this year I want to explore something a</text>
  <text start="40.95" dur="4.83">little different in the book of Esther</text>
  <text start="42.48" dur="5.46">something that I just discovered not too</text>
  <text start="45.78" dur="3.68">long ago with some friends of mine as we</text>
  <text start="47.94" dur="3.93">were doing a study on the book of Esther</text>
  <text start="49.46" dur="6.31">but there are some amazing prophetic</text>
  <text start="51.87" dur="6.63">implications prophetic shadow pictures</text>
  <text start="55.77" dur="4.74">in the book of Esther I&amp;#39;ve always known</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="4.739">that Esther does have shadow pictures</text>
  <text start="60.51" dur="6.51">pointing toward the end times but hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="63.239" dur="5.641">seen some of these that that were in the</text>
  <text start="67.02" dur="3.599">book maybe some of you have already</text>
  <text start="68.88" dur="3.38">found these I don&amp;#39;t know but I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="70.619" dur="6.811">share what I found</text>
  <text start="72.26" dur="8.469">starting in Esther 3:10 when the King s</text>
  <text start="77.43" dur="5.97">Reyes first allows Haman to go forth</text>
  <text start="80.729" dur="5.46">with his plan to destroy the Jewish</text>
  <text start="83.4" dur="4.74">people it says the king took his ring</text>
  <text start="86.189" dur="3.691">from his hand and gave it unto Haman the</text>
  <text start="88.14" dur="6.08">son of Hamid otha</text>
  <text start="89.88" dur="6.72">the aggregate the Jews enemy so the King</text>
  <text start="94.22" dur="5.1">officiates this seals it with his ring</text>
  <text start="96.6" dur="6.479">and allows Haman to have this this power</text>
  <text start="99.32" dur="7.03">then if you flip forward to Esther 8</text>
  <text start="103.079" dur="5.881">verse 8 so toward the end of the story</text>
  <text start="106.35" dur="6.54">this is when the King is now allowing</text>
  <text start="108.96" dur="6.42">Mordecai to have the upper hand and it</text>
  <text start="112.89" dur="4.229">says right ye also for the Jews as it</text>
  <text start="115.38" dur="3.96">lacketh you at the King&amp;#39;s name and seal</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="3.811">it with the king&amp;#39;s ring for the writing</text>
  <text start="119.34" dur="3.65">which is written in the King&amp;#39;s name and</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="5.88">seal with the king&amp;#39;s ring may no man</text>
  <text start="122.99" dur="6.43">reverse so there&amp;#39;s the first prophetic</text>
  <text start="126.81" dur="6.539">picture we first have the King&amp;#39;s ring</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="5.04">giving Haman the power and then it comes</text>
  <text start="133.349" dur="3.271">now with the king</text>
  <text start="134.46" dur="5.46">ring to give Mordecai and Esther the</text>
  <text start="136.62" dur="5.61">power to overcome the enemies of the</text>
  <text start="139.92" dur="5.07">Jews and what I saw here is that only</text>
  <text start="142.23" dur="5.16">Yahshua only Yahshua HaMashiach the</text>
  <text start="144.99" dur="4.35">Messiah will be able to defeat the</text>
  <text start="147.39" dur="5.4">Antichrist he&amp;#39;s the only one that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="149.34" dur="5.64">going to be able to overcome the evil</text>
  <text start="152.79" dur="6.44">that comes across this earth for those</text>
  <text start="154.98" dur="7.14">final 42 months of the Antichrist rain</text>
  <text start="159.23" dur="7.9">the next prophetic picture after that is</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="6.81">if you look at Esther 8 verse 15 now</text>
  <text start="167.13" dur="5.46">this is after Haman has been has been</text>
  <text start="168.93" dur="5.64">killed after you know Esther Mordechai</text>
  <text start="172.59" dur="4.11">have attained the victory and it says</text>
  <text start="174.57" dur="4.92">Mordecai went out from the presence of</text>
  <text start="176.7" dur="5.64">the king in royal apparel of blue and</text>
  <text start="179.49" dur="4.38">white and with a Great crown of gold and</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="4.8">with a garment of fine linen and purple</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="5.82">and the City of Shushan rejoiced and was</text>
  <text start="187.14" dur="6.36">glad so right there in that verse that</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="5.64">is a picture of the resurrection so on</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="4.95">yom teruah some yom teruah</text>
  <text start="195.33" dur="4.74">in the future I believe yom teruah 2017</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="3">Yahshua is going to resurrect his bride</text>
  <text start="200.07" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re going to be called up to meet him</text>
  <text start="201.45" dur="4.92">in the sky and we&amp;#39;re gonna be given new</text>
  <text start="204.03" dur="4.71">bodies and I think with Mordecai being</text>
  <text start="206.37" dur="6.45">clothed in this royal apparel that is a</text>
  <text start="208.74" dur="6.57">direct picture of the resurrection of us</text>
  <text start="212.82" dur="5.37">receiving our new bodies receiving new</text>
  <text start="215.31" dur="6.15">names and being with Yahshua being made</text>
  <text start="218.19" dur="5.73">like the angels and being known as we</text>
  <text start="221.46" dur="5.67">are known by by yah and I just think</text>
  <text start="223.92" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s a beautiful picture there then</text>
  <text start="227.13" dur="5.58">after the resurrection we have a picture</text>
  <text start="228.93" dur="5.91">of the wedding feast the lamb and also</text>
  <text start="232.71" dur="6.48">something else here it&amp;#39;s in Esther 8</text>
  <text start="234.84" dur="6.03">verse 17 I&amp;#39;ll read I&amp;#39;ll read verse 16 -</text>
  <text start="239.19" dur="4.86">it says the Jews have light and gladness</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="5.22">and joy in honor and in every province</text>
  <text start="244.05" dur="3.75">and in every city whithersoever the</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="3.87">king&amp;#39;s commandment in history came the</text>
  <text start="247.8" dur="4.77">Joy&amp;#39;s had joy the Jews had joy and</text>
  <text start="249.96" dur="4.74">gladness so we have a picture here of</text>
  <text start="252.57" dur="3.78">the wedding feast of the Lamb so after</text>
  <text start="254.7" dur="4.409">we get resurrected we go meet yash from</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="5.46">the sky we have this glorious wonderful</text>
  <text start="259.109" dur="5.821">wedding piece of the land and then it</text>
  <text start="261.81" dur="4.71">says in the remainder of verse 17 had a</text>
  <text start="264.93" dur="2.9">feast and a good day and many of the</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="4.519">people the land</text>
  <text start="267.83" dur="4.98">Jews for the fear of the Jews fell upon</text>
  <text start="271.039" dur="4.021">them it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s this huge</text>
  <text start="272.81" dur="3.9">conversion of so many people becoming</text>
  <text start="275.06" dur="5.88">Jews now because of what had happened</text>
  <text start="276.71" dur="6.09">and this reminds me of in Isaiah 60 this</text>
  <text start="280.94" dur="3.84">is at the very beginning of the</text>
  <text start="282.8" dur="3.63">Millennial Kingdom when we have returned</text>
  <text start="284.78" dur="3.509">with Yahshua down on mount Olive&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.43" dur="3.209">Yahshua was destroyed the Antichrist in</text>
  <text start="288.289" dur="3.541">the beasts army and we are now ruling</text>
  <text start="289.639" dur="4.68">and reigning with him from Jerusalem and</text>
  <text start="291.83" dur="5.01">there are still many unconverted people</text>
  <text start="294.319" dur="5.07">on planet earth at that time it says in</text>
  <text start="296.84" dur="5.19">Isaiah 60 arise shine if your light has</text>
  <text start="299.389" dur="5.071">come and the glory of Yas risen upon you</text>
  <text start="302.03" dur="4.83">for behold the darkness shall cover the</text>
  <text start="304.46" dur="4.47">earth and gross darkness the people but</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="4.83">Yahweh shall arise upon you and his</text>
  <text start="308.93" dur="4.62">glory shall be seen upon you and the</text>
  <text start="311.69" dur="4.189">Gentile shall come to your light and</text>
  <text start="313.55" dur="5.339">Kings to the brightness of your rising</text>
  <text start="315.879" dur="4.63">lift up your eyes roundabout and see all</text>
  <text start="318.889" dur="4.171">they either gather themselves together</text>
  <text start="320.509" dur="3.991">they come to you your son shall come</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="4.77">from far and your daughter shall be</text>
  <text start="324.5" dur="5.219">nursed at your side then you shall see</text>
  <text start="327.83" dur="3.899">and flow together and your heart shall</text>
  <text start="329.719" dur="3.931">fear and be enlarged because the</text>
  <text start="331.729" dur="4.201">abundance of the sea shall be converted</text>
  <text start="333.65" dur="4.739">unto you and the forces of the Gentiles</text>
  <text start="335.93" dur="4.56">shall come unto you and you can continue</text>
  <text start="338.389" dur="4.231">to reading in Isaiah 64 that beautiful</text>
  <text start="340.49" dur="5.549">picture of all these people now coming</text>
  <text start="342.62" dur="5.82">up to Jerusalem and that just it just</text>
  <text start="346.039" dur="5.731">totally reminds me of that verse in</text>
  <text start="348.44" dur="5.19">Esther where all this all these people</text>
  <text start="351.77" dur="3.869">became Jews they converted the Jews</text>
  <text start="353.63" dur="5.219">after Mordecai and Esther some mighty</text>
  <text start="355.639" dur="7.261">victory and then of course as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.849" dur="6.361">proceeding on in Esther chapter 9 in</text>
  <text start="362.9" dur="3.9">verse 2 it says the Jews gathered</text>
  <text start="365.21" dur="4.44">themselves together in their cities</text>
  <text start="366.8" dur="5.28">throughout all the provinces of the King</text>
  <text start="369.65" dur="5.28">to lay hands on such as sought their</text>
  <text start="372.08" dur="4.549">hurt and no man could withstand them for</text>
  <text start="374.93" dur="4.289">the fear of them fell upon all people</text>
  <text start="376.629" dur="5.621">now this reminds me of Yahshua is return</text>
  <text start="379.219" dur="5.461">to earth as pictured in Revelation 19 I</text>
  <text start="382.25" dur="4.77">mean here he comes on a white winged</text>
  <text start="384.68" dur="4.109">steed he explodes from the sky with the</text>
  <text start="387.02" dur="4.769">heavenly armies and he comes down and</text>
  <text start="388.789" dur="6.541">destroys all of his enemies and no man</text>
  <text start="391.789" dur="7.44">can withstand him we read about that in</text>
  <text start="395.33" dur="6.149">Revelation chapter 19 starting in verse</text>
  <text start="399.229" dur="4.381">11 and I saw heaven opened</text>
  <text start="401.479" dur="3.78">behold a white horse and he that sat</text>
  <text start="403.61" dur="4.169">upon him was called faithful and true</text>
  <text start="405.259" dur="5.071">and in righteousness he doth judge and</text>
  <text start="407.779" dur="4.35">make war his eyes were as flames of fire</text>
  <text start="410.33" dur="3.809">and on his head were many crowns and he</text>
  <text start="412.129" dur="4.111">had a name written that no man knew but</text>
  <text start="414.139" dur="3.87">he himself and he was clothed with a</text>
  <text start="416.24" dur="4.59">vesture dipped in blood his name is</text>
  <text start="418.009" dur="4.59">called the word yah and the armies which</text>
  <text start="420.83" dur="3.839">we&amp;#39;re in heaven followed him upon white</text>
  <text start="422.599" dur="4.41">horses clothed and fine linen white and</text>
  <text start="424.669" dur="3.93">clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp</text>
  <text start="427.009" dur="3.27">sword that with it he should smite the</text>
  <text start="428.599" dur="3.391">nation&amp;#39;s and he shall rule them with a</text>
  <text start="430.279" dur="4.23">rod of iron and treadeth the winepress</text>
  <text start="431.99" dur="5.009">of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty</text>
  <text start="434.509" dur="3.9">God and he hath on his vesture and on</text>
  <text start="436.999" dur="5.461">his thigh a name written king of kings</text>
  <text start="438.409" dur="5.671">and Lord of lords and then it goes on to</text>
  <text start="442.46" dur="4.41">describe the destruction that happens to</text>
  <text start="444.08" dur="5.73">the to the beasts armies so this reminds</text>
  <text start="446.87" dur="5.099">me of the end of Esther where the Jewish</text>
  <text start="449.81" dur="5.669">people are now allowed to destroy those</text>
  <text start="451.969" dur="5.94">whom were appointed to destroy them</text>
  <text start="455.479" dur="4.17">you know Haman was going to unleash the</text>
  <text start="457.909" dur="4.44">fury of the kingdom against the Jews on</text>
  <text start="459.649" dur="4.8">the certain at the certain time and</text>
  <text start="462.349" dur="4.231">instead that was reversed and the Jews</text>
  <text start="464.449" dur="4.71">were able to basically destroy their</text>
  <text start="466.58" dur="3.78">enemies so there&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="469.159" dur="4.611">there&amp;#39;s just one thing after another</text>
  <text start="470.36" dur="6.51">that has these prophetic shadow pictures</text>
  <text start="473.77" dur="4.75">that are better than later described in</text>
  <text start="476.87" dur="5.609">the book of Isaiah and Daniel and</text>
  <text start="478.52" dur="10.31">revelation the very very end of Esther</text>
  <text start="482.479" dur="10.77">in chapter 10 yeah it talks about how</text>
  <text start="488.83" dur="6.489">basically a sir eros lays tribute upon</text>
  <text start="493.249" dur="3.811">the entire land and Mordecai is made</text>
  <text start="495.319" dur="3.96">like the second highest in all the land</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="4.319">and again this reminds me of just the</text>
  <text start="499.279" dur="5.521">Millennial Kingdom where Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="501.379" dur="5.52">ruling and reigning from Jerusalem no</text>
  <text start="504.8" dur="4.22">doubt laying tribute upon the various</text>
  <text start="506.899" dur="4.02">lands in fact we read in Zechariah 14</text>
  <text start="509.02" dur="3.759">that all nations are going to be</text>
  <text start="510.919" dur="3.87">commanded to come up to Jerusalem for</text>
  <text start="512.779" dur="4.32">the Peace of Tabernacles and of course</text>
  <text start="514.789" dur="5.701">those who do not they won&amp;#39;t receive any</text>
  <text start="517.099" dur="5.31">rain they&amp;#39;ll just be dropped so we have</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="3.63">the same type of picture here where the</text>
  <text start="522.409" dur="4.951">King leaves tribute upon the land upon</text>
  <text start="524.12" dur="5.909">the Isles of the sea goes all across the</text>
  <text start="527.36" dur="4.62">the known world at that time Mordecai is</text>
  <text start="530.029" dur="4.261">next under the king he&amp;#39;s great among the</text>
  <text start="531.98" dur="2.83">Jews he&amp;#39;s accepted by the multitude of</text>
  <text start="534.29" dur="3.05">his brother</text>
  <text start="534.81" dur="4.21">he seeks the wealth of his people and</text>
  <text start="537.34" dur="3.66">speaks peace to Wallace Eaton of course</text>
  <text start="539.02" dur="3.42">we know during the time when Yasha was</text>
  <text start="541" dur="4.29">ruling and reigning from Jerusalem that</text>
  <text start="542.44" dur="6.98">Jerusalem will be made of praise and all</text>
  <text start="545.29" dur="7.35">the earth Israel will be a diamond a gem</text>
  <text start="549.42" dur="6.04">a glittering jewel the center of the</text>
  <text start="552.64" dur="4.5">earth so anyway these are just some some</text>
  <text start="555.46" dur="3.75">prophetic pictures in the book of Esther</text>
  <text start="557.14" dur="3.78">certainly not an exhaustive study I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="559.21" dur="3.81">sure there are many many more in the</text>
  <text start="560.92" dur="4.35">book of Esther maybe you can find them</text>
  <text start="563.02" dur="5.16">yourself but I just wanted to share</text>
  <text start="565.27" dur="5.58">those to you with you on this feast of</text>
