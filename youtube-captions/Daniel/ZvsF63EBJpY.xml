  <text start="20.4" dur="5.01">US Syria and Russia it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="22.83" dur="6.15">interesting that it was exactly a year</text>
  <text start="25.41" dur="7.86">ago this month that Obama was on the</text>
  <text start="28.98" dur="6.54">verge of bombing Syria to remove the</text>
  <text start="33.27" dur="5.879">Assad regime of course we all know what</text>
  <text start="35.52" dur="6.84">happened Obama back down because Russia</text>
  <text start="39.149" dur="5.91">in effect was threatening to start World</text>
  <text start="42.36" dur="5.49">War three if the u.s. decided to attack</text>
  <text start="45.059" dur="5.541">Assad they threatened to attack Saudi</text>
  <text start="47.85" dur="5.93">Arabia and there was some backdoor</text>
  <text start="50.6" dur="5.38">arm-twisting and diplomacy and then</text>
  <text start="53.78" dur="4.15">Obama basically said that they had</text>
  <text start="55.98" dur="6">reached out a diplomatic deal with</text>
  <text start="57.93" dur="6.24">Russia to facilitate Assad getting rid</text>
  <text start="61.98" dur="4.92">of his chemical weapons of course we</text>
  <text start="64.17" dur="6.57">know that those chemical weapons really</text>
  <text start="66.9" dur="5.34">never were removed still in Syria and of</text>
  <text start="70.74" dur="3.09">course there&amp;#39;s also questions about who</text>
  <text start="72.24" dur="3.21">actually used the chemical weapons was</text>
  <text start="73.83" dur="3.719">it Assad or was it the Syrian rebels</text>
  <text start="75.45" dur="5.63">many of whom which now identify with</text>
  <text start="77.549" dur="8.671">Isis so now here we are a year later and</text>
  <text start="81.08" dur="7.96">once again Obama has authorized the use</text>
  <text start="86.22" dur="6.289">of air strikes against Syria only this</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="8.189">time has he detailed in this speech on</text>
  <text start="92.509" dur="7.631">September the 10th he intends to bomb</text>
  <text start="97.229" dur="6.981">Syria to attack not the Assad regime but</text>
  <text start="100.14" dur="7.29">Isis Isis militants within Syria now</text>
  <text start="104.21" dur="6.79">Syria has been saying well if you want</text>
  <text start="107.43" dur="6.66">to use air strikes against the Isis</text>
  <text start="111" dur="5.31">militants in our country you need to get</text>
  <text start="114.09" dur="3.569">our cooperation of course the United</text>
  <text start="116.31" dur="4.019">States says no way we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="3.841">cooperate with Assad we hate Assad we</text>
  <text start="120.329" dur="4.261">hate his regime we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="5.009">cooperate with him but Assad is saying</text>
  <text start="124.59" dur="5.029">well you need to get our permission you</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="6.281">need to cooperate with us because they</text>
  <text start="129.619" dur="5.96">fear that if the US starts</text>
  <text start="132.79" dur="5.819">bombing Syria to destroy Isis that they</text>
  <text start="135.579" dur="5.461">will also start bombing Assads</text>
  <text start="138.609" dur="5.061">government and what&amp;#39;s interesting is</text>
  <text start="141.04" dur="5.399">that this article that I just found and</text>
  <text start="143.67" dur="5.049">it&amp;#39;s starting to pop up now on a bunch</text>
  <text start="146.439" dur="5.071">of different news agencies within the</text>
  <text start="148.719" dur="5.671">last 24 48 hours is that Russia is now</text>
  <text start="151.51" dur="6.149">saying that because the u.s. is refusing</text>
  <text start="154.39" dur="6.209">to seek the cooperation and permission</text>
  <text start="157.659" dur="4.98">of the Syrian government to bomb Isis</text>
  <text start="160.599" dur="4.97">targets within Syria Russia suspects</text>
  <text start="162.639" dur="6.151">that the United States will also try to</text>
  <text start="165.569" dur="8.831">use the bombing of Isis within Syria as</text>
  <text start="168.79" dur="7.02">a pretext to bomb Assad regime and rush</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="4.649">is basically saying that they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="175.81" dur="5.489">angry about this and if the u.s. refuses</text>
  <text start="179.049" dur="4.86">to get the cooperation and agreement and</text>
  <text start="181.299" dur="6.421">permission of Damascus of the Assad</text>
  <text start="183.909" dur="5.401">regime then they have no choice but to</text>
  <text start="187.72" dur="5.129">believe that the United States is going</text>
  <text start="189.31" dur="5.67">to use the bombing of Isis in Syria as a</text>
  <text start="192.849" dur="6">pretext and a cover to also start</text>
  <text start="194.98" dur="5.249">bombing Assad regime now the United</text>
  <text start="198.849" dur="2.64">States may indeed start doing that</text>
  <text start="200.229" dur="5.16">because that&amp;#39;s what they wanted to do a</text>
  <text start="201.489" dur="6.691">year ago but even if even if Obama and</text>
  <text start="205.389" dur="3.66">the US military are not planning to do</text>
  <text start="208.18" dur="4.019">that even if they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="209.049" dur="6.211">everything they can to avoid bombing</text>
  <text start="212.199" dur="5.97">Assad regime and only strike Isis the</text>
  <text start="215.26" dur="5.069">perception by both Russia and Damascus</text>
  <text start="218.169" dur="6.871">is that that&amp;#39;s not what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="220.329" dur="6.78">do so here we are now on the verge of</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="4.47">the fall feast once again a year later</text>
  <text start="227.109" dur="5.791">and we&amp;#39;re almost in the exact same</text>
  <text start="229.51" dur="5.369">position we were in a year ago where the</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="4.919">United States is getting ready to bomb</text>
  <text start="234.879" dur="5.79">Syria and Russia is very upset about it</text>
  <text start="237.819" dur="6.361">of course Russia is very strong allies</text>
  <text start="240.669" dur="6.261">with the Assad regime and with Syria so</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="6.029">it&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see if what was</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="6.19">looking like it would transpire a year</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="7.171">ago is now actually going to unfold this</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="6.149">year and I heard something on satellite</text>
  <text start="257.38" dur="4.039">radio news yesterday and I forget which</text>
  <text start="259.269" dur="4.091">news anchor was but basically they said</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="3.261">that</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="2.579">you know the United States is going to</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="3.269">be working on doing reconnaissance</text>
  <text start="265.939" dur="4.021">missions and trying to identify targets</text>
  <text start="267.949" dur="4.201">within Syria but that within a month</text>
  <text start="269.96" dur="4.799">over the next month they&amp;#39;re planning to</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="5.16">start these air strikes on Syria and</text>
  <text start="274.759" dur="5.4">that&amp;#39;s very interesting because a month</text>
  <text start="277.31" dur="5.699">from now would coincide with Sukkot the</text>
  <text start="280.159" dur="5.82">Feast of Tabernacles which is probably</text>
  <text start="283.009" dur="6.09">the most important and biggest feast of</text>
  <text start="285.979" dur="5.761">the year and a very prophetic fall feast</text>
  <text start="289.099" dur="5.16">as well so as the fall feasts are</text>
  <text start="291.74" dur="6.12">approaching and as the US now is getting</text>
  <text start="294.259" dur="5.52">ready to bomb Syria to take out Isis</text>
  <text start="297.86" dur="3.329">targets within Syria and Russia saying</text>
  <text start="299.779" dur="4.561">no you better not because we think</text>
  <text start="301.189" dur="5.521">you&amp;#39;re going to bomb a Syrian government</text>
  <text start="304.34" dur="4.139">forces it&amp;#39;ll be really interesting to</text>
  <text start="306.71" dur="5">see what happens and how this all plays</text>
  <text start="308.479" dur="5.55">out so I just wanted to highlight those</text>

  <text start="321.199" dur="5.28">very suspicious and very angry and very</text>
  <text start="323.529" dur="4.991">upset about the u.s. wanting to bomb</text>
  <text start="326.479" dur="5.071">Syria without seeking the permission or</text>
