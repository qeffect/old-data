  <text start="139.21" dur="3.37">Washington let&amp;#39;s just go over here so</text>
  <text start="141.26" dur="5.07">this again this is where Washington</text>
  <text start="142.58" dur="5.58">crossed the Delaware River here in</text>
  <text start="146.33" dur="5.58">Trenton the capital of New Jersey and</text>
  <text start="148.16" dur="5.49">they surprised the German soldiers the</text>
  <text start="151.91" dur="4.38">hestenes who were allies of the British</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="4.19">they did this on Christmas Eve night and</text>
  <text start="156.29" dur="4.5">this turned the tide of the battle</text>
  <text start="157.84" dur="4.869">because up until this point we had been</text>
  <text start="160.79" dur="7.68">the Americans we we had been losing the</text>
  <text start="162.709" dur="7.261">war because Washington and his soldiers</text>
  <text start="168.47" dur="5.88">weren&amp;#39;t gonna honor Christmas they knew</text>
  <text start="169.97" dur="10.56">it was pagan yeah yeah they wanted</text>
  <text start="174.35" dur="8.39">decisive victory so this is it pretty</text>
  <text start="180.53" dur="5.88">amazing huh</text>
  <text start="182.74" dur="5.47">now is this is that Pennsylvania over</text>

  <text start="188.21" dur="4.4">across the river and we&amp;#39;re in New Jersey</text>
  <text start="190.55" dur="4.65">and this is the Delaware River</text>
  <text start="192.61" dur="4.3">so the Delaware River provided a natural</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="2.94">barrier between the American soldiers</text>
  <text start="196.91" dur="6.72">and the British soldiers who are on the</text>
  <text start="198.14" dur="7.29">other side in Pennsylvania and again up</text>
  <text start="203.63" dur="6.24">until this point the Americans had</text>
  <text start="205.43" dur="5.88">suffered several losses to the point</text>
  <text start="209.87" dur="2.7">where the Brit the British Army was</text>
  <text start="211.31" dur="3.83">becoming so successful they were</text>
  <text start="212.57" dur="5.82">offering amnesty to many of the</text>
  <text start="215.14" dur="7.18">Colonials colonists see if they would</text>
  <text start="218.39" dur="5.58">switch sides and literally Washington&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="222.32" dur="3.6">army because of being decimated by</text>
  <text start="223.97" dur="3.84">disease deserters and people who</text>
  <text start="225.92" dur="4.98">accepted annecy they were down to only</text>
  <text start="227.81" dur="4.649">four thousand men and then that that</text>
  <text start="230.9" dur="4.53">Christmas night that Christmas Eve night</text>
  <text start="232.459" dur="4.951">they crossed over and ambushed the</text>
  <text start="235.43" dur="3.81">heston teens the allies of the British</text>
  <text start="237.41" dur="2.82">soldiers and totally decimated them and</text>
  <text start="239.24" dur="2.67">that was that was a victory that</text>
  <text start="240.23" dur="3.45">literally would go down in history as</text>
  <text start="241.91" dur="2.9">turning the tide of the war and from</text>
