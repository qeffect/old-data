  <text start="44.85" dur="5.279">remember way back on April the 7th I</text>
  <text start="47.67" dur="5.04">made a video called Molly Moll human</text>
  <text start="50.129" dur="5.34">trafficking and Obama and deep panic and</text>
  <text start="52.71" dur="5.579">I talked about when Obama was visiting</text>
  <text start="55.469" dur="6.18">overseas I think he was in Germany he</text>
  <text start="58.289" dur="6.421">was giving a talk to some students and</text>
  <text start="61.649" dur="6.091">he kept talking about his worries and</text>
  <text start="64.71" dur="5.43">concerns about deep fake technology</text>
  <text start="67.74" dur="5.129">about this technology that can imitate</text>
  <text start="70.14" dur="4.62">and make it seem like you were saying</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="4.261">something even when it&amp;#39;s not you and how</text>
  <text start="74.76" dur="5.1">I said that this was basically Obama</text>
  <text start="77.13" dur="4.529">panicking because he knows a lot of very</text>
  <text start="79.86" dur="4.53">damaging information is coming out about</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="5.481">him and so he&amp;#39;s trying to get ahead of</text>
  <text start="84.39" dur="5.7">that by condemning this technology and</text>
  <text start="87.14" dur="4.45">basically setting himself up so that</text>
  <text start="90.09" dur="3.06">when this damaging information does come</text>
  <text start="91.59" dur="3.48">out he could say oh well that&amp;#39;s just the</text>
  <text start="93.15" dur="4.259">deep fake technology that&amp;#39;s making it</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="4.89">seem like I said that so I&amp;#39;ll leak a</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="4.621">link to that video that I made back on</text>
  <text start="99.96" dur="4.83">April 7th well it&amp;#39;s happened again this</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="4.74">just happened on June the 1st and this</text>
  <text start="104.79" dur="4.23">is an article that came out on June the</text>
  <text start="106.77" dur="5.52">1st that says Obama tells Ottawa crowd</text>
  <text start="109.02" dur="5.07">deep fake videos have him worried people</text>
  <text start="112.29" dur="4.92">can duplicate me speaking and saying</text>
  <text start="114.09" dur="5.01">anything he says Barack Obama says he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="117.21" dur="4.08">concerned deep fake videos will have</text>
  <text start="119.1" dur="4.11">real-life consequences messing with</text>
  <text start="121.29" dur="4.829">people&amp;#39;s abilities to sort fact from</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="5.46">fiction the former US president told an</text>
  <text start="126.119" dur="5.191">Ottawa audience Friday evening he&amp;#39;s seen</text>
  <text start="128.67" dur="4.44">fake videos bearing his likeness powered</text>
  <text start="131.31" dur="4.32">by artificial intelligence</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="4.11">his voice and movements people can</text>
  <text start="135.63" dur="3.96">duplicate me speaking and saying</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="3.93">anything and it sounds like me and it</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="4.47">looks like I&amp;#39;m saying it and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="4.44">complete fabrication Obama said he</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="3.87">explained part of the problem is because</text>
  <text start="145.59" dur="4.35">the human brain hasn&amp;#39;t adapted quickly</text>
  <text start="147.93" dur="3.93">enough to process the onslaught of</text>
  <text start="149.94" dur="4.02">information readily available to them on</text>
  <text start="151.86" dur="3.36">multiple platforms and artificial</text>
  <text start="153.96" dur="3.57">intelligence is only going to make</text>
  <text start="155.22" dur="5.76">things worse especially for democracies</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="5.79">he said so once again we have this</text>
  <text start="160.98" dur="3.78">happening where Obama you know I think</text>
  <text start="163.32" dur="4.139">it&amp;#39;s like his last three public</text>
  <text start="164.76" dur="5.31">appearances he has specifically made</text>
  <text start="167.459" dur="4.5">this the topic why all of a sudden is he</text>
  <text start="170.07" dur="4.23">concerned about deep fake technology in</text>
  <text start="171.959" dur="4.261">fact can you ever remember him</text>
  <text start="174.3" dur="3.92">expressing concerns about this through</text>
  <text start="176.22" dur="5.19">the eight years of his presidency I</text>
  <text start="178.22" dur="6.46">can&amp;#39;t think of even one time where he</text>
  <text start="181.41" dur="5.76">did that so again I think this is more</text>
  <text start="184.68" dur="5.04">proof that Obama knows the hammer is</text>
  <text start="187.17" dur="4.98">coming down he knows he&amp;#39;s implicated in</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="5.13">fact if you&amp;#39;ve seen the Hannity show</text>
  <text start="192.15" dur="4.14">from this past Friday night and if you</text>
  <text start="194.85" dur="4.26">haven&amp;#39;t I encourage you to find it on</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="5.79">YouTube and watch it Hannity he has a</text>
  <text start="199.11" dur="4.5">panel of all the people who have been so</text>
  <text start="202.08" dur="4.29">fervently investigating the Russia</text>
  <text start="203.61" dur="5.64">collusion hoax and it&amp;#39;s very clear that</text>
  <text start="206.37" dur="6.54">they all agree Obama is going to be</text>
  <text start="209.25" dur="5.459">implicated in this investigation so</text>
  <text start="212.91" dur="4.65">Obama clearly is very worried he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.709" dur="5.581">panicking and this is just more proof</text>
  <text start="217.56" dur="4.47">that he is panicking now I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="220.29" dur="4.71">how much how many people have you saw</text>
  <text start="222.03" dur="6">this this was a posted by James Comey</text>
  <text start="225" dur="5.75">just I think it was yesterday and he</text>
  <text start="228.03" dur="7.53">tweeted out I&amp;#39;ll show you guys a tweet</text>
  <text start="230.75" dur="7.78">here so bill bar on CBS offers no facts</text>
  <text start="235.56" dur="5.25">an AG shouldn&amp;#39;t be echoing conspiracy</text>
  <text start="238.53" dur="5.67">theories he should gather facts and show</text>
  <text start="240.81" dur="4.83">them that&amp;#39;s what justice is about q now</text>
  <text start="244.2" dur="3.78">within only just a few minutes of</text>
  <text start="245.64" dur="7.29">posting that he he reposted it and</text>
  <text start="247.98" dur="5.49">deleted the Q so I don&amp;#39;t think it was an</text>
  <text start="252.93" dur="2.7">accident</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="4.769">I think I think James Comey was trying</text>
  <text start="255.63" dur="5.789">to to troll William bar trying to troll</text>
  <text start="258.239" dur="4.981">Q and Q and on movement he deleted it</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="3.81">only just a few minutes afterwards so if</text>
  <text start="263.22" dur="3.169">you go to his Twitter page now you won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="265.229" dur="5.06">see the Q there you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="266.389" dur="5.731">see his original tweet but to me him</text>
  <text start="270.289" dur="4.71">doing something like that again is</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="7.049">another sign of panic he is in deep deep</text>
  <text start="274.999" dur="7.111">panic just like his friend Obama let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.169" dur="6.571">talk about Julian Assange this was a</text>
  <text start="282.11" dur="5.7">story published on June 2nd 2019 the</text>
  <text start="285.74" dur="4.739">Justice Department is surprised with</text>
  <text start="287.81" dur="5.3">decision not to charge Assange over his</text>
  <text start="290.479" dur="5.131">role in the devastating CIA leak</text>
  <text start="293.11" dur="4.48">according to a US official the Justice</text>
  <text start="295.61" dur="5.339">Department has decided not to charge</text>
  <text start="297.59" dur="7.52">Julian Assange for exposing some of the</text>
  <text start="300.949" dur="6.511">CIA&amp;#39;s most secret spying tools it is a</text>
  <text start="305.11" dur="4.809">decent surprise for national security</text>
  <text start="307.46" dur="4.739">experts after given prosecutors recent</text>
  <text start="309.919" dur="3">decision to aggressively go after the</text>
  <text start="312.199" dur="2.911">weak why key</text>
  <text start="312.919" dur="4.231">WikiLeaks founder on more controversial</text>
  <text start="315.11" dur="3.75">Espionage Act charges that some legal</text>
  <text start="317.15" dur="3.78">experts said would not hold up in court</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="4.529">the decision also means that Assange</text>
  <text start="320.93" dur="4.889">will not face public punishment for</text>
  <text start="323.389" dur="4.77">publishing one of the CIA&amp;#39;s most potent</text>
  <text start="325.819" dur="7.051">and Arsenal digital code used to hack</text>
  <text start="328.159" dur="7.32">devices dubbed vault 7 the one of the</text>
  <text start="332.87" dur="4.169">most devastating leak in CIA history not</text>
  <text start="335.479" dur="2.701">only essentially rendered those tools</text>
  <text start="337.039" dur="3.72">useless for the CIA</text>
  <text start="338.18" dur="5.639">it gave foreign spies and rogue hackers</text>
  <text start="340.759" dur="5.34">Act access to them so this article goes</text>
  <text start="343.819" dur="4.891">on just to basically say that that those</text>
  <text start="346.099" dur="4.921">charges where he he exposed these CIA</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="5.25">tools which good for Julian Assange you</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="4.859">know the CIA is is an organization that</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="4.979">in my mind needs to be completely and</text>
  <text start="355.879" dur="5.611">totally disbanded because of what is</text>
  <text start="358.939" dur="4.141">done over history but he is not going to</text>
  <text start="361.49" dur="3.479">be charged with that he&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="363.08" dur="4.319">be charged with that and it looks like</text>
  <text start="364.969" dur="4.021">the Justice Department this is toward</text>
  <text start="367.399" dur="3.54">the end of the article the Justice</text>
  <text start="368.99" dur="5.25">Department will go after Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="370.939" dur="6.72">only on assisting Manning and the 18 out</text>
  <text start="374.24" dur="5.609">18 count Espionage Act indictment so</text>
  <text start="377.659" dur="4.141">here&amp;#39;s what I think this means I believe</text>
  <text start="379.849" dur="2.79">that they drop these charges regarding</text>
  <text start="381.8" dur="3.41">his</text>
  <text start="382.639" dur="5.911">revealing of these CIA tools because</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="6.22">William bars DOJ has no plans on</text>
  <text start="388.55" dur="4.019">actually throwing Julian Assange in jail</text>
  <text start="391.43" dur="3.69">and punishing him</text>
  <text start="392.569" dur="6.241">I think they&amp;#39;ve dropped these charges</text>
  <text start="395.12" dur="4.35">and the charges involving Manning and</text>
  <text start="398.81" dur="3.06">the 18</text>
  <text start="399.47" dur="4.68">espionage act indictment I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.87" dur="4.14">only simply to get Julian Assange over</text>
  <text start="404.15" dur="4.95">here to extradite him to have a reason</text>
  <text start="406.01" dur="5.04">to get him into our hands into into the</text>
  <text start="409.1" dur="3.72">hands of the Patriots so that he can</text>
  <text start="411.05" dur="4.98">give his full testimony and be a key</text>
  <text start="412.82" dur="6.06">witness against the deep state so I know</text>
  <text start="416.03" dur="4.23">he&amp;#39;s been gravely ill our prayer team</text>
  <text start="418.88" dur="5.28">has been praying for him and hopefully</text>
  <text start="420.26" dur="6.27">he is recovering there I want to remind</text>
  <text start="424.16" dur="4.92">people about something that happened</text>
  <text start="426.53" dur="5.76">back in April this is a story that was</text>
  <text start="429.08" dur="6.06">published on April 16 2019 and this is</text>
  <text start="432.29" dur="5.55">where Senator Rand Paul proposes</text>
  <text start="435.14" dur="5.82">immunity for Assange in exchange for</text>
  <text start="437.84" dur="4.98">testimony Senator Rand Paul proposes the</text>
  <text start="440.96" dur="4.38">potential offering of immunity from</text>
  <text start="442.82" dur="4.77">prosecution for WikiLeaks founder Julian</text>
  <text start="445.34" dur="4.11">Assange in exchange for the latter&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.59" dur="4.2">testimony at a Senate Intelligence</text>
  <text start="449.45" dur="4.08">Committee hearing in a story reported</text>
  <text start="451.79" dur="3.33">first by Gateway pundit the</text>
  <text start="453.53" dur="3.66">constitutionally minded senator</text>
  <text start="455.12" dur="3.87">suggested the compromise as a way of</text>
  <text start="457.19" dur="4.38">getting valuable information</text>
  <text start="458.99" dur="5.25">Assange might have without causing him</text>
  <text start="461.57" dur="4.11">greater harm and Rand Paul actually says</text>
  <text start="464.24" dur="3.06">this he says I think that he should be</text>
  <text start="465.68" dur="3.93">given immunity from prosecution in</text>
  <text start="467.3" dur="3.18">exchange for coming to the United States</text>
  <text start="469.61" dur="2.7">and testifying</text>
  <text start="470.48" dur="3.48">Senator Paul told the Gateway pundit I</text>
  <text start="472.31" dur="3.69">think he&amp;#39;s been someone who has released</text>
  <text start="473.96" dur="3.84">a lot of information and you can debate</text>
  <text start="476" dur="4.08">whether or not any of that has caused</text>
  <text start="477.8" dur="3.99">harm but I really think he is</text>
  <text start="480.08" dur="3.33">information that is probably pertinent</text>
  <text start="481.79" dur="3.18">to the hacking of the Democratic emails</text>
  <text start="483.41" dur="4.92">that would be nice to hear so this was</text>
  <text start="484.97" dur="4.68">back in April of this year and I just</text>
  <text start="488.33" dur="4.23">wanted to remind people of that because</text>
  <text start="489.65" dur="6.09">I think again cue the Patriots President</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="5.73">Trump he knows about Rand Paul senator</text>
  <text start="495.74" dur="5.1">he knows about his his intentions of</text>
  <text start="498.29" dur="4.32">wanting to offer Assange immunity in</text>
  <text start="500.84" dur="3.96">exchange for testimony and I think</text>
  <text start="502.61" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s exactly what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="504.8" dur="3.75">so we need to be praying that Assange</text>
  <text start="506.75" dur="5.52">can get extradited be brought over here</text>
  <text start="508.55" dur="5.13">and allow his testimony to take down the</text>
  <text start="512.27" dur="5.13">deep State even more than it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="513.68" dur="6.359">being taken down hallelujah all right</text>
