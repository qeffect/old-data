  <text start="24.21" dur="6.51">youtube you user Yeshua lives asked of</text>
  <text start="27.09" dur="6.09">me he posted a comment under an episode</text>
  <text start="30.72" dur="6.72">that I recorded last fall where he asked</text>
  <text start="33.18" dur="6.51">me to record a youtube that explores the</text>
  <text start="37.44" dur="6.029">difference between Sunday and the</text>
  <text start="39.69" dur="7.2">genuine seventh-day Sabbath that is</text>
  <text start="43.469" dur="7.201">commanded in the Torah that the prophets</text>
  <text start="46.89" dur="8.13">preached that the Israelites apostasy</text>
  <text start="50.67" dur="9.51">from that Yahshua observed and that the</text>
  <text start="55.02" dur="6.929">Apostles upheld of course today in most</text>
  <text start="60.18" dur="4.769">Christian churches with the exception of</text>
  <text start="61.949" dur="5.701">the seventh-day Adventists few strains</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="6.091">of seventh-day Baptists most Christians</text>
  <text start="67.65" dur="5.88">go to church and observe at least a</text>
  <text start="71.04" dur="5.16">semblance of the Sabbath on Sunday but</text>
  <text start="73.53" dur="4.769">sunday if you look at most calendar</text>
  <text start="76.2" dur="4.47">sunday is considered the first day of</text>
  <text start="78.299" dur="5.82">the week not the seventh day of the week</text>
  <text start="80.67" dur="4.949">so how did we get to the sunday keeping</text>
  <text start="84.119" dur="4.921">observance and what is the difference</text>
  <text start="85.619" dur="6.18">between the Sabbath and Sunday I was</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="3.539">raised to go into church on Sunday I was</text>
  <text start="91.799" dur="5.221">raised on a non-denominational</text>
  <text start="92.579" dur="6.811">charismatic church as I grew up but when</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="5.61">you read the scriptures it&amp;#39;s very clear</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="6.299">that Sunday is not the Sabbath first of</text>
  <text start="102.63" dur="6.93">all we the Sabbath dates all the way</text>
  <text start="105.689" dur="6.991">back to Genesis and to creation week</text>
  <text start="109.56" dur="6.36">where Yahweh Institute&amp;#39;s that day even</text>
  <text start="112.68" dur="6.53">before the fall and it&amp;#39;s repeated in the</text>
  <text start="115.92" dur="5.129">Ten Commandments in Exodus chapter 20</text>
  <text start="119.21" dur="3.43">it&amp;#39;s very clear that there is a</text>
  <text start="121.049" dur="4.801">particular day it&amp;#39;s the seventh day of</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="5.489">the week that we are to observe as the</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="4.889">Sabbath day now the seventh day of the</text>
  <text start="128.129" dur="4.211">week occurs from friday at sunset until</text>
  <text start="130.739" dur="5.83">saturday at</text>
  <text start="132.34" dur="7.08">sunset and we read furthermore in the</text>
  <text start="136.569" dur="4.861">Torah and throughout this knock that the</text>
  <text start="139.42" dur="4.83">Sabbath day is supposed to be something</text>
  <text start="141.43" dur="4.41">that we are to observe throughout our</text>
  <text start="144.25" dur="4.319">generations and it&amp;#39;s a perpetual</text>
  <text start="145.84" dur="4.77">ordinance that should never end in fact</text>
  <text start="148.569" dur="4.5">we even read in the last chapter of</text>
  <text start="150.61" dur="5.04">Isaiah Isaiah chapter 66 it says that</text>
  <text start="153.069" dur="4.351">and it&amp;#39;s referring to the future when</text>
  <text start="155.65" dur="3.21">all flesh comes before Yahweh to worship</text>
  <text start="157.42" dur="3.99">them it says from one new moon to</text>
  <text start="158.86" dur="5.82">another and from one sabbath to another</text>
  <text start="161.41" dur="5.46">shall all flesh come before me so if in</text>
  <text start="164.68" dur="4.619">the future when Yahweh rules and reigns</text>
  <text start="166.87" dur="3.81">here on earth and all flesh has gathered</text>
  <text start="169.299" dur="3.421">before him to worship Him if in the</text>
  <text start="170.68" dur="5.85">future the new moons and the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="172.72" dur="5.34">days are to be observed then how can we</text>
  <text start="176.53" dur="3.959">say that they&amp;#39;re not to be observed</text>
  <text start="178.06" dur="3.81">right now our people will often say well</text>
  <text start="180.489" dur="3.511">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter you can pick whatever</text>
  <text start="181.87" dur="3.75">day you want but that&amp;#39;s not true because</text>
  <text start="184" dur="3.42">the commandment very clearly says in</text>
  <text start="185.62" dur="3.869">Exodus 20 but it&amp;#39;s the seventh day the</text>
  <text start="187.42" dur="3.929">we not the first day not the third day</text>
  <text start="189.489" dur="4.53">not the fifth day but the seventh day</text>
  <text start="191.349" dur="5.341">that this is supposed to be the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="194.019" dur="4.5">if we go into the Gospels we find that</text>
  <text start="196.69" dur="3.329">Yahshua himself observed the Sabbath day</text>
  <text start="198.519" dur="3.391">this was the day in which he did most of</text>
  <text start="200.019" dur="4.831">his healings he did most of his miracles</text>
  <text start="201.91" dur="5.31">on Yahshua observed the Sabbath it says</text>
  <text start="204.85" dur="4.41">we read and in the Book of Luke that he</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="5.879">would go his practice was to go to the</text>
  <text start="209.26" dur="5.28">synagogue on the Sabbath day and so he</text>
  <text start="213.099" dur="5.401">observed the Sabbath day well shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="214.54" dur="7.14">we want to emulate our habits and our</text>
  <text start="218.5" dur="5.459">character after Yahshua the Messiah yes</text>
  <text start="221.68" dur="5.429">the answer is yes we are to keep the</text>
  <text start="223.959" dur="5.161">Sabbath day where to keep it holy where</text>
  <text start="227.109" dur="5.611">did Sunday come into being well what</text>
  <text start="229.12" dur="5.85">happened was is that pretty early on a</text>
  <text start="232.72" dur="4.199">little over 300 years after yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="234.97" dur="4.079">resurrection there was a council of</text>
  <text start="236.919" dur="4.921">nicea and at this council constantine he</text>
  <text start="239.049" dur="5.19">was an apostate decided to Mel Roman</text>
  <text start="241.84" dur="5.1">pagan Sun God worship with the truth of</text>
  <text start="244.239" dur="5.131">the scriptures with with the belief in</text>
  <text start="246.94" dur="3.9">Yahshua and that&amp;#39;s what led to the seeds</text>
  <text start="249.37" dur="3.229">of the Roman Catholic Church and</text>
  <text start="250.84" dur="5.22">basically what is today considered</text>
  <text start="252.599" dur="4.211">modern Christianity and at this council</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="3.539">there were several things that were</text>
  <text start="256.81" dur="4.62">decided one was to move the Sabbath from</text>
  <text start="259.599" dur="4.801">the seventh day of the week from Shabbat</text>
  <text start="261.43" dur="3.86">to sunday sunday of course is named</text>
  <text start="264.4" dur="3.32">after the Sun</text>
  <text start="265.29" dur="3.99">God on which the pagans would venerate</text>
  <text start="267.72" dur="3.54">the Sun God and the the thinking was</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="4.41">look let&amp;#39;s move the Sabbath to Sunday</text>
  <text start="271.26" dur="3.99">because there&amp;#39;s a lot of pagan Sun God</text>
  <text start="273.69" dur="3.17">worshippers in the Roman Empire and</text>
  <text start="275.25" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re going to feel more comfortable</text>
  <text start="276.86" dur="4.93">gathering to worship on Sunday because</text>
  <text start="279.87" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re used to that and we&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="281.79" dur="4.14">stamp it instead with Christ oh this of</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="3.42">course is not what Yahshua would want us</text>
  <text start="285.93" dur="3.9">to do back we know very clear that</text>
  <text start="287.7" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s not good to do from the story</text>
  <text start="289.83" dur="4.53">about the golden calf when the children</text>
  <text start="292.02" dur="4.26">of Israel tried to take a pagan statue</text>
  <text start="294.36" dur="4.02">of golden calf and they dedicated it to</text>
  <text start="296.28" dur="4.29">Yahweh and Yahoo it was so upset with</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="4.2">that that you know three thousand of</text>
  <text start="300.57" dur="4.65">those Israelites Wanda perishing that</text>
  <text start="302.58" dur="4.47">day because Yahweh was so upset so he</text>
  <text start="305.22" dur="4.53">doesn&amp;#39;t want us to take pagan things and</text>
  <text start="307.05" dur="5.13">to wrap them in truth because this is</text>
  <text start="309.75" dur="4.08">very distasteful to him so that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="312.18" dur="3.84">sunday came to be it was the Roman</text>
  <text start="313.83" dur="3.45">Catholic and and Roman Catholics to this</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="2.88">day and a lot of their writings that</text>
  <text start="317.28" dur="3">freely admit that they changed the</text>
  <text start="318.9" dur="3.48">Sabbath day that they acknowledge that</text>
  <text start="320.28" dur="3.36">the true Sabbath is the ones that the</text>
  <text start="322.38" dur="2.67">Jews have been keeping for thousands of</text>
  <text start="323.64" dur="3.48">years on the seventh day of week and</text>
  <text start="325.05" dur="4.77">that they moved it and and they admit</text>
  <text start="327.12" dur="7.89">that the Protestants sometimes are less</text>
  <text start="329.82" dur="8.16">reticent to to admit that they move the</text>
  <text start="335.01" dur="4.79">Sabbath but they follow a large part the</text>
  <text start="337.98" dur="4.65">tradition of their Roman Catholic</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="4.75">forefathers and they go along with it</text>
  <text start="342.63" dur="3.69">but the sunday is the first day of the</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="3.12">week is a work day it&amp;#39;s a commanded work</text>
  <text start="346.32" dur="3.33">day it&amp;#39;s one of the six work days that</text>
  <text start="347.67" dur="5.34">were commanded to work instructors but</text>
  <text start="349.65" dur="6.78">the Sabbath is on on the seventh bounce</text>
  <text start="353.01" dur="4.95">what is considered by man Saturday and</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="3.96">this is preserved in cultures as well</text>
  <text start="357.96" dur="5.66">you go to the Spanish word for Saturday</text>
  <text start="360.39" dur="7.05">sabado which literally means the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="363.62" dur="5.83">and and so you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll discover that</text>
  <text start="367.44" dur="5.13">in a lot of cultures including the</text>
  <text start="369.45" dur="6.45">Jewish culture of course that mankind</text>
  <text start="372.57" dur="7.94">globally recognizes that the seventh day</text>
  <text start="375.9" dur="7.05">saturday is in fact the Sabbath day so</text>
  <text start="380.51" dur="4.09">while there may be nothing intrinsically</text>
  <text start="382.95" dur="3.63">wrong or evil and going to church on a</text>
  <text start="384.6" dur="3.72">Sunday it&amp;#39;s the Sabbath day it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="386.58" dur="3">seventh day of the week Friday night to</text>
  <text start="388.32" dur="2.97">Saturday night that we need to make sure</text>
  <text start="389.58" dur="3.12">that we&amp;#39;re resting that we&amp;#39;re not buying</text>
  <text start="391.29" dur="4.29">and selling that we&amp;#39;re devoting a Devi</text>

  <text start="395.58" dur="5.03">buy de sel and the duo</text>

  <text start="400.61" dur="4.17">we need to be doing scriptures are very</text>
  <text start="402.41" dur="3.69">very clear on this a lot of articles a</text>
