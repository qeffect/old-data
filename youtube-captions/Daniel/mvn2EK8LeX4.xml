  <text start="0" dur="7.56">okay yeah Bob Boone Anka and Darren here</text>
  <text start="3.78" dur="7.23">tonight and this is the 16th day of the</text>
  <text start="7.56" dur="5.4">tenth hebrew month and this is part one</text>
  <text start="11.01" dur="4.02">of a series will be going through for</text>
  <text start="12.96" dur="3.78">the next several nights as we continue</text>
  <text start="15.03" dur="4.02">to meet every night on skype fellowship</text>
  <text start="16.74" dur="5.28">and this is part one of the renewed</text>
  <text start="19.05" dur="4.979">covenant study guide this is actually a</text>
  <text start="22.02" dur="5.669">link on my website at spirit and tour</text>
  <text start="24.029" dur="6.061">com but this deals with the New</text>
  <text start="27.689" dur="4.62">Testament how it relates to keep in the</text>
  <text start="30.09" dur="4.32">Torah how many ways Christians have</text>
  <text start="32.309" dur="4.111">misunderstood the New Testament the</text>
  <text start="34.41" dur="5.25">Gospels and many of the writings of</text>
  <text start="36.42" dur="4.59">apostle shall Apostle Paul and the</text>
  <text start="39.66" dur="3.51">writings are the other authors of the</text>
  <text start="41.01" dur="4.92">the New Testament or more accurately</text>
  <text start="43.17" dur="5.369">it&amp;#39;s called the renewed covenant because</text>
  <text start="45.93" dur="5.51">it&amp;#39;s the first covenant being renewed by</text>
  <text start="48.539" dur="5.401">the blood of Yahshua and by a spirit</text>
  <text start="51.44" dur="3.91">it&amp;#39;s helpful to define what a covenant</text>
  <text start="53.94" dur="3.54">is because a lot of Christians don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="55.35" dur="5.25">understand what a covenant is a covenant</text>
  <text start="57.48" dur="5.7">involves three elements there&amp;#39;s Yahweh</text>
  <text start="60.6" dur="3.9">there&amp;#39;s the people that enter into that</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="3.72">covenant with them and then there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="64.5" dur="4.26">Torah so in the first covenant you had</text>
  <text start="66.9" dur="4.2">Yahweh you have the children of Israel</text>
  <text start="68.76" dur="4.679">and gathered at Mount Sinai and you have</text>
  <text start="71.1" dur="5.28">the Torah in the renewed covenant you</text>
  <text start="73.439" dur="6.031">have Yahweh you have his people Israel</text>
  <text start="76.38" dur="4.71">and Judah and the Torah it&amp;#39;s just this</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="3.63">time he found fault with them the first</text>
  <text start="81.09" dur="3.959">time so the second time he&amp;#39;s ratifying</text>
  <text start="83.1" dur="3.75">that same Torah in his blood and by</text>
  <text start="85.049" dur="4.351">spirit this is according to Hebrews 8</text>
  <text start="86.85" dur="4.35">and so this time many people are going</text>
  <text start="89.4" dur="4.289">to walk in his ways because of Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="91.2" dur="4.2">1119 through 20 being fulfilled that the</text>
  <text start="93.689" dur="4.021">Holy Spirit filling us which was poured</text>
  <text start="95.4" dur="5.1">out first at the fulfillment of Shavuot</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="4.769">Pentecost that spirit was given to us as</text>
  <text start="100.5" dur="3.93">prophesied by Ezekiel to cause us to</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="5.43">walk in the statutes ordinances and</text>
  <text start="104.43" dur="4.829">commandments of the Torah so with that</text>
  <text start="107.909" dur="3.091">said we&amp;#39;re going to start with part one</text>
  <text start="109.259" dur="3.811">here of going through the New Testament</text>
  <text start="111" dur="4.079">and related issues and before we even</text>
  <text start="113.07" dur="3.75">get into the text of the New Testament</text>
  <text start="115.079" dur="4.14">and dealing with some of these passages</text>
  <text start="116.82" dur="5.13">that Christians have so often twisted or</text>
  <text start="119.219" dur="4.68">misunderstood which makes it sound like</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="3.87">the New Testament tells us that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="123.899" dur="3.271">have to keep the Torah but before we</text>
  <text start="125.82" dur="2.549">even touch on that we&amp;#39;re going to we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="127.17" dur="3.39">going to touch with a little bit of</text>
  <text start="128.369" dur="5.071">history because we need to understand</text>
  <text start="130.56" dur="6.6">why modern-day Christianity</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="7.68">so far off from what the first century</text>
  <text start="137.16" dur="6.06">renewed covenant believers were like</text>
  <text start="141.12" dur="5.46">under Yahshua and then and then of</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="6.75">course under the Apostles so start off</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="5.7">with a little testimony here and this is</text>
  <text start="149.97" dur="5.1">titled why modern-day Christianity is a</text>
  <text start="152.28" dur="4.49">farce Who I am my name is Daniel Lee I</text>
  <text start="155.07" dur="4.23">was brought up as a non-denominational</text>
  <text start="156.77" dur="4.39">Protestant Christian the particular</text>
  <text start="159.3" dur="3.9">branch of Protestantism that I grew up</text>
  <text start="161.16" dur="4.23">with was the charismatic branch or</text>
  <text start="163.2" dur="3.69">non-denominational charismatic we</text>
  <text start="165.39" dur="2.73">believe in the scriptures is truth and</text>
  <text start="166.89" dur="3.24">also believe in the gifts of the Holy</text>
  <text start="168.12" dur="4.98">Spirit basically a non-denominational</text>
  <text start="170.13" dur="4.47">form of pentecostalism for those of you</text>
  <text start="173.1" dur="2.94">not familiar with all the branches on</text>
  <text start="174.6" dur="3">modern Christianity I&amp;#39;ll make it real</text>
  <text start="176.04" dur="3.93">simple you can divide Christianity and</text>
  <text start="177.6" dur="4.74">two main groups the Roman Catholics and</text>
  <text start="179.97" dur="4.5">the Protestants there are a few other</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="4.02">groups as well such as the Coptic Church</text>
  <text start="184.47" dur="3.27">and eat Egypt the Celtic Church in</text>
  <text start="186.36" dur="3.92">Britain and of course there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="187.74" dur="5.13">Eastern Orthodox Church in the east</text>
  <text start="190.28" dur="4">however these last year are very similar</text>
  <text start="192.87" dur="3.27">to the Roman Catholic Church in many</text>
  <text start="194.28" dur="3.959">ways so in reality there really are only</text>
  <text start="196.14" dur="5.04">two main segments of Christianity</text>
  <text start="198.239" dur="4.891">Protestants and Catholics over the last</text>
  <text start="201.18" dur="3.63">several years my eyes began to open and</text>
  <text start="203.13" dur="3.21">I began to realize that the Protestant</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="5.22">faith that I had been taught and raised</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="5.94">in did not fully reflect scripture nor</text>
  <text start="210.03" dur="5.91">to reflect with Jesus Christ or Yahshua</text>
  <text start="212.28" dur="6.53">HaMashiach actually taught so let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="215.94" dur="5.519">back in time the first century believers</text>
  <text start="218.81" dur="5.44">ready for a brief history lesson here it</text>
  <text start="221.459" dur="4.5">goes Yahshua on the ship was raised in a</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="4.14">ghetto town in northern Israel known as</text>
  <text start="225.959" dur="4.441">Nazareth thus when Yahshua began</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="4.349">ministering the disciples who follow</text>
  <text start="230.4" dur="5.97">them call themselves Nazarene or the net</text>
  <text start="232.739" dur="5.191">serene or those of the way in no way</text>
  <text start="236.37" dur="4.05">related to the modern-day Christian</text>
  <text start="237.93" dur="4.2">denominations of the Nazarenes according</text>
  <text start="240.42" dur="3.569">to the renewed covenant or the Christian</text>
  <text start="242.13" dur="3.42">New Testament Yahshua taught his</text>
  <text start="243.989" dur="4.141">disciples how to correctly keep the</text>
  <text start="245.55" dur="4.58">Torah the laws and ordinances given to</text>
  <text start="248.13" dur="5.37">Moses from the Hebrew Creator Yahweh</text>
  <text start="250.13" dur="6.31">Matthew chapter 5 verse 17 through 21</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="4.859">makes it clear that Yahshua in no way</text>
  <text start="256.44" dur="4.26">did away with the Torah or Mosaic law</text>
  <text start="258.359" dur="4.591">rather he came to show the Jews how to</text>
  <text start="260.7" dur="4.38">correctly interpret and keep the Torah</text>
  <text start="262.95" dur="3.18">out of a heart of love many of the</text>
  <text start="265.08" dur="3.33">rabbi&amp;#39;s in Jewish</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="5.04">added man-made traditions and twisted</text>
  <text start="268.41" dur="4.8">the Torah beyond recognition Yahshua</text>
  <text start="271.17" dur="5.85">came to restore both the spirit and the</text>
  <text start="273.21" dur="6.66">true letter of the Torah Yahshua was not</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="5.22">a Christian he was not a Western Gentile</text>
  <text start="279.87" dur="5.16">he was not an American yatra was a</text>
  <text start="282.24" dur="5.28">Hebrew kosher rabbi who kept the letter</text>
  <text start="285.03" dur="4.08">and spirit of the Torah indeed this is</text>
  <text start="287.52" dur="3.75">what it means when it says Yahshua</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="4.92">fulfilled the Torah just like when</text>
  <text start="291.27" dur="5.1">yoking on the immerse ur baptized or</text>
  <text start="294.03" dur="4.86">immersed Yahshua said this must be done</text>
  <text start="296.37" dur="3.84">to fulfill all righteousness Yahshua had</text>
  <text start="298.89" dur="3.81">to obey that commandment just like</text>
  <text start="300.21" dur="5.19">Joshua fulfilled the Torah he obeyed the</text>
  <text start="302.7" dur="4.08">Torah that&amp;#39;s all that that means not</text>
  <text start="305.4" dur="3.6">only did Yahshua teach the Ten</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="4.95">Commandments he taught the roughly</text>
  <text start="309" dur="4.95">remaining 590 some odd Commandments and</text>
  <text start="311.73" dur="3.72">Torah as well not only did Yahshua teach</text>
  <text start="313.95" dur="3.15">people to love Yahweh with all their</text>
  <text start="315.45" dur="3.72">heart soul mind and strength and their</text>
  <text start="317.1" dur="4.44">neighbors themselves but he also taught</text>
  <text start="319.17" dur="4.65">people to eat kosher only clean animals</text>
  <text start="321.54" dur="4.62">where the ZZ which josh of course did</text>
  <text start="323.82" dur="4.14">and that is according to numbers 15 he</text>
  <text start="326.16" dur="3.93">kept the Sabbath on the 7th day that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="327.96" dur="4.29">in Luke for 16 it says it was his custom</text>
  <text start="330.09" dur="3.42">to go into the synagogue on the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="3.39">day that&amp;#39;s the seventh day of the week</text>
  <text start="333.51" dur="4.29">from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset</text>
  <text start="335.64" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s not sunday sunday is a work day</text>
  <text start="337.8" dur="3.84">he kept the Hebrew feast days such as</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="4.08">Passover the feast of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="341.64" dur="5.07">firstfruits chavalo yom teruah yom</text>
  <text start="344.16" dur="4.11">kippur Sukkot in the last great day he</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="4.38">kept all the other laws and ordinances</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="5.49">found in the Torah Yahshua himself since</text>
  <text start="351.09" dur="4.56">he was a kosher Jewish rabbi had to keep</text>
  <text start="353.76" dur="3.48">all these Commandments or he would have</text>
  <text start="355.65" dur="3.66">never been allowed inside a synagogue</text>
  <text start="357.24" dur="4.47">and of course not only was he allowed</text>
  <text start="359.31" dur="3.78">inside the synagogue but we read many</text>
  <text start="361.71" dur="2.7">times in the Gospels where he would go</text>
  <text start="363.09" dur="3.27">into the synagogue on Sabbath and</text>
  <text start="364.41" dur="3.39">actually start teaching well he would</text>
  <text start="366.36" dur="3.12">never have been permitted to do that by</text>
  <text start="367.8" dur="4.8">the Jewish leadership if he was</text>
  <text start="369.48" dur="5.49">violating Torah his disciples emulated</text>
  <text start="372.6" dur="5.49">Yahshua and also kept the Torah even as</text>
  <text start="374.97" dur="4.92">Yahshua kept it after all what is the</text>
  <text start="378.09" dur="4.62">word Christian mean but disciple of</text>
  <text start="379.89" dur="6.24">Christ and what is the disciple but one</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="5.07">who emulates or mimics the master so</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="2.91">since Yahshua kept the Torah if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="387.78" dur="3.15">going to call ourselves disciples of</text>
  <text start="389.04" dur="3.75">Yahshua or disciples of Christ for</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="4.95">Christians then we should keep the Torah</text>
  <text start="392.79" dur="5.04">as well shortly after Yasha was nailed</text>
  <text start="395.88" dur="4.17">to the tree died and then resurrected</text>
  <text start="397.83" dur="4.649">the disciples began to go out across you</text>
  <text start="400.05" dur="3.869">samaria and the roman empire preaching</text>
  <text start="402.479" dur="4.321">and teaching others with Yahshua taught</text>
  <text start="403.919" dur="5.101">these early followers were not at first</text>
  <text start="406.8" dur="4.23">called Christians the term Christian was</text>
  <text start="409.02" dur="4.26">introduced that was not introduced until</text>
  <text start="411.03" dur="4.83">much later in Antioch and was used as a</text>
  <text start="413.28" dur="5.22">derisive name for the followers of the</text>
  <text start="415.86" dur="5.339">way they called themselves the Netzarim</text>
  <text start="418.5" dur="4.53">or followers of the way these net serene</text>
  <text start="421.199" dur="4.111">kept all the biblical customs of the</text>
  <text start="423.03" dur="3.69">Jews and different from the Jews only in</text>
  <text start="425.31" dur="3.87">that they believed Yasha was the</text>
  <text start="426.72" dur="4.439">prophesied Jewish Messiah and they also</text>
  <text start="429.18" dur="4.56">rejected many of the Talmudic traditions</text>
  <text start="431.159" dur="4.711">that opposed Torah for the next 40 years</text>
  <text start="433.74" dur="4.049">the next re more those of the way live</text>
  <text start="435.87" dur="3.81">with the other Jews in relative peace in</text>
  <text start="437.789" dur="3.541">fact the only place where the next</text>
  <text start="439.68" dur="3.78">stream were unable to live with the Jews</text>
  <text start="441.33" dur="3.72">in peace was in Jerusalem where much of</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="3.989">the Jewish hierarchy persecuted the</text>
  <text start="445.05" dur="3.81">early net serene however everywhere else</text>
  <text start="447.449" dur="3.06">to netstream made much headway and</text>
  <text start="448.86" dur="3.929">converting even the top priests of the</text>
  <text start="450.509" dur="4.111">jews in fact the book of Acts even says</text>
  <text start="452.789" dur="3.991">there were many Sadducees priests</text>
  <text start="454.62" dur="4.769">officiating in the temple who became</text>

  <text start="473.969" dur="5.04">worshipped Yahshua as the promised</text>
  <text start="476.19" dur="5.069">Jewish Messiah however unlike many of</text>
  <text start="479.009" dur="4.111">the Jews the Netzarim did not uphold the</text>
  <text start="481.259" dur="4.801">Talmud or all these oral traditions</text>
  <text start="483.12" dur="5.21">above the Torah and that&amp;#39;s very much</text>
  <text start="486.06" dur="4.74">explained in the book of Galatians as</text>
  <text start="488.33" dur="4.239">you can probably see these first century</text>

  <text start="492.569" dur="4.201">kept the Torah did not do not look at</text>
  <text start="494.639" dur="4.861">all like what modern Christians do today</text>

  <text start="503.069" dur="5.491">domination none of them seem to reflect</text>
  <text start="505.61" dur="6.04">what these early first century believers</text>
  <text start="508.56" dur="5.159">actually did so what happened where did</text>
  <text start="511.65" dur="3.87">Christianity the modern-day Christianity</text>
  <text start="513.719" dur="5.18">come from and what happened to the net</text>
  <text start="515.52" dur="7.559">serene the original followers of Yahshua</text>
  <text start="518.899" dur="7.781">she was trying to join in real quick the</text>
  <text start="523.079" dur="6.901">early church pagan fathers well for the</text>
  <text start="526.68" dur="5.399">next 200 years the Roman Empire tried to</text>
  <text start="529.98" dur="2.59">destroy the Netzarim or the followers of</text>
  <text start="532.079" dur="2.741">the way</text>
  <text start="532.57" dur="4.2">because they refused to give allegiance</text>

  <text start="536.77" dur="4.2">government sought to eradicate the net</text>
