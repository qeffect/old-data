  <text start="18.24" dur="2.699">Portland you know the city of Portland</text>
  <text start="19.65" dur="2.73">stone is the city of bridges we have a</text>
  <text start="20.939" dur="4.651">lot of bridges about eight or nine of</text>
  <text start="22.38" dur="6.69">them but this st. Johns bridge in my</text>
  <text start="25.59" dur="5.099">opinion it&amp;#39;s the most beautiful it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="29.07" dur="3.419">actually created in the same style as</text>
  <text start="30.689" dur="4.381">the San Francisco bridge but obviously</text>
  <text start="32.489" dur="4.491">it&amp;#39;s not gold and then of course you</text>
  <text start="35.07" dur="4.35">have this beautiful cathedral park</text>
  <text start="36.98" dur="6.72">beneath the bridge that I&amp;#39;m standing</text>
  <text start="39.42" dur="4.28">it&amp;#39;s just gorgeous</text>
  <text start="44.82" dur="6.509">the reason I chose this particular spot</text>
  <text start="48.66" dur="5.91">to film the seventh day of unleavened</text>
  <text start="51.329" dur="5.881">bread is I just the majestic bridge just</text>
  <text start="54.57" dur="4.41">reminds me of how yah hmm when we get</text>
  <text start="57.21" dur="5.7">our lives right and we turn to Him and</text>
  <text start="58.98" dur="5.1">we live holy and we love him with all</text>
  <text start="62.91" dur="2.55">our heart soul mind and strength love</text>
  <text start="64.08" dur="3.3">our neighbors ourself when we start</text>
  <text start="65.46" dur="4.29">keeping his word seeking to keep his</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="5.22">Commandments his Torah he builds bridges</text>
  <text start="69.75" dur="4.59">in our lives he builds bridges to allow</text>
  <text start="72.6" dur="3.93">us to do things that we weren&amp;#39;t able to</text>
  <text start="74.34" dur="4.139">do before he shifts things in our lives</text>
  <text start="76.53" dur="3.33">and spiritually and physically and in</text>
  <text start="78.479" dur="4.981">many ways relationships with other</text>
  <text start="79.86" dur="4.47">people building bridges that are good</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="2.85">that are taking us in the right</text>
  <text start="84.33" dur="4.53">direction rather than taking us in the</text>
  <text start="86.31" dur="4.559">wrong direction or having bridges burn</text>
  <text start="88.86" dur="3.509">and crash sometimes it&amp;#39;s good for</text>
  <text start="90.869" dur="4.201">bridges to burn and crash if we need to</text>
  <text start="92.369" dur="4.86">turn away from wickedness but but I just</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="4.47">thought that that was special to film</text>
  <text start="97.229" dur="3.39">this while I talk about that but you</text>
  <text start="99.54" dur="2.969">know today&amp;#39;s the seventh day of</text>
  <text start="100.619" dur="3.721">unleavened bread it&amp;#39;s the final day of</text>
  <text start="102.509" dur="4.29">the the Jewish feast of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="104.34" dur="4.279">and a lot of people don&amp;#39;t know that in</text>
  <text start="106.799" dur="5.401">the in the Bible in the scriptures</text>

  <text start="118.409" dur="4.081">seven days of unleavened bread they</text>
  <text start="119.969" dur="5.071">spent marching around Jericho as Yahweh</text>

  <text start="125.04" dur="3.839">and the armies of Israel and for six</text>
  <text start="127.29" dur="4.169">days the people were silent</text>
  <text start="128.879" dur="4.331">they just circled the the city wants and</text>
  <text start="131.459" dur="4.481">and the priests would blow their home</text>
  <text start="133.21" dur="5.22">turns their trumpets or shofars but then</text>
  <text start="135.94" dur="4.26">on the seventh day which is today hi the</text>
  <text start="138.43" dur="4.26">second this is the second-highest rabat</text>
  <text start="140.2" dur="3.48">of the the Hebrew New Year the first I</text>

  <text start="147.37" dur="3.9">don&amp;#39;t know is a it&amp;#39;s not like a normal</text>

  <text start="153.07" dur="3.96">Saturday sundown the seventh day of the</text>
  <text start="154.48" dur="4.77">week a weekly Sabbath depending on the</text>
  <text start="157.03" dur="3.87">new moon and depending on when Passover</text>
  <text start="159.25" dur="4.56">falls every year it can happen on any</text>
  <text start="160.9" dur="4.41">day of the week so just so you know that</text>
  <text start="163.81" dur="3.51">but anyway this is the second high</text>
  <text start="165.31" dur="6.45">Sabbath or the seventh day of unleavened</text>
  <text start="167.32" dur="6.6">bread and it was on this day that after</text>
  <text start="171.76" dur="4.71">marching around Jericho for six days on</text>
  <text start="173.92" dur="4.5">that seventh day this time they marched</text>
  <text start="176.47" dur="5.82">around the city seven times on that</text>
  <text start="178.42" dur="5.7">seventh day and those seven ram&amp;#39;s horns</text>
  <text start="182.29" dur="4.23">or seven shofar seven trumpets at the</text>
  <text start="184.12" dur="4.14">seven priests bore before the Ark blew</text>
  <text start="186.52" dur="3.72">it and the people were no longer silent</text>
  <text start="188.26" dur="4.11">but they shouted with a loud shout and</text>
  <text start="190.24" dur="3.66">of course the walls of Jericho came</text>
  <text start="192.37" dur="3.72">tumbling down it was the first major</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="4.56">victory Jericho was a very well</text>
  <text start="196.09" dur="4.53">fortified city thick thick walls and</text>
  <text start="198.46" dur="4.32">even archeology proves now that those</text>
  <text start="200.62" dur="4.23">walls fell outward you know some</text>
  <text start="202.78" dur="3.75">skeptics of the Bible tried to say well</text>
  <text start="204.85" dur="3.66">those walls fell because the Israelites</text>
  <text start="206.53" dur="3.33">you know attacked attack the walls and</text>
  <text start="208.51" dur="3.3">they fell in Word like any like any</text>
  <text start="209.86" dur="4.32">siege would have happened but actually</text>
  <text start="211.81" dur="4.26">they found out the walls based on where</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="4.62">the stones fell fell outwards which</text>
  <text start="216.07" dur="4.08">could only be done by yeah because the</text>
  <text start="218.8" dur="2.61">people trying to be protected by those</text>
  <text start="220.15" dur="3.96">walls wouldn&amp;#39;t have pushed their own</text>
  <text start="221.41" dur="4.29">walls outward so in any case yah caused</text>
  <text start="224.11" dur="3.6">the those walls to fall down</text>
  <text start="225.7" dur="3.71">supernaturally and then of course the</text>
  <text start="227.71" dur="3.9">children of Israel were victorious over</text>
  <text start="229.41" dur="4.51">over that city that major stronghold</text>
  <text start="231.61" dur="4.35">defeated the enemy routed them dedicated</text>
  <text start="233.92" dur="3.99">the silver and gold a yon destroyed and</text>
  <text start="235.96" dur="3.84">burned everything else and saved Rahab</text>
  <text start="237.91" dur="3.45">and his family Rahab the prostitute save</text>
  <text start="239.8" dur="3.6">her out because of her faith in</text>
  <text start="241.36" dur="4.41">preserving the two spies weeks before</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="4.8">and she became part of Israel so we have</text>
  <text start="245.77" dur="5.25">the first example of a Gentile becoming</text>
  <text start="248.2" dur="4.23">part of Israel just like today Gentiles</text>
  <text start="251.02" dur="3.27">through the blood of Yahshua can become</text>

  <text start="255.43" dur="4.59">forever in any case those walls came</text>
  <text start="258.1" dur="3.69">down the walls of the enemy came down so</text>
