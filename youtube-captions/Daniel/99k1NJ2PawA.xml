  <text start="103.5" dur="6.54">think really helped to show kind of what</text>
  <text start="107.46" dur="9.619">I experienced this week and not just</text>
  <text start="110.04" dur="11.039">this week but throughout my life so in</text>
  <text start="117.079" dur="8.171">Philippians chapter four Paul was</text>
  <text start="121.079" dur="6.57">talking and he says in verse 6 be</text>
  <text start="125.25" dur="3.84">careful for nothing but in everything by</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="3.271">prayer and supplication with</text>
  <text start="129.09" dur="2.479">Thanksgiving let your requests be made</text>

  <text start="142.219" dur="4.11">supposed to be worried or anxious about</text>
  <text start="143.689" dur="4.44">things we&amp;#39;re supposed to bring our</text>
  <text start="146.329" dur="3.181">supplications in our requests with</text>
  <text start="148.129" dur="3.931">Thanksgiving always a heart of</text>
  <text start="149.51" dur="4.77">thanksgiving to Yahshua and his peace</text>
  <text start="152.06" dur="5.099">will will fill us and that should be a</text>
  <text start="154.28" dur="4.739">natural part of our lives so Paul says</text>
  <text start="157.159" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t be careful don&amp;#39;t be careful in</text>
  <text start="159.019" dur="7.14">terms of anxiousness but now if you go</text>
  <text start="161.209" dur="6.721">to 2nd Corinthians 7 11 it says this for</text>
  <text start="166.159" dur="4.351">behold the self same thing that you</text>
  <text start="167.93" dur="5.279">sorrowed after a godly sark sort what</text>
  <text start="170.51" dur="4.259">carefulness it wrought in you yay what</text>
  <text start="173.209" dur="3.691">clearing of yourselves yay what</text>
  <text start="174.769" dur="4.56">indignation yay what fear yay what</text>
  <text start="176.9" dur="4.199">vehement desire yay what zeal yay what</text>
  <text start="179.329" dur="4.44">revenge and all things you&amp;#39;ve approved</text>
  <text start="181.099" dur="4.59">yourself to be clear in this matter and</text>
  <text start="183.769" dur="3.42">Paul is referring to some sin that was</text>
  <text start="185.689" dur="4.02">going on in in the Corinthian</text>
  <text start="187.189" dur="3.871">congregation you see there is a certain</text>
  <text start="189.709" dur="2.881">sense in which we do need to have</text>
  <text start="191.06" dur="5.459">carefulness and that carefulness is a</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="5.97">zeal na na carefulness not to allow sin</text>
  <text start="196.519" dur="4.71">in our lives not to allow that sin that</text>
  <text start="198.56" dur="4.709">so easily entangles us right so there is</text>
  <text start="201.229" dur="4.47">that carefulness that we must have in</text>
  <text start="203.269" dur="4.71">our lives at all times to make sure that</text>
  <text start="205.699" dur="4.981">we&amp;#39;re staying centered on Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="207.979" dur="6.21">that if temptation comes we are careful</text>
  <text start="210.68" dur="6.179">to keep ourselves in Messiah and away</text>
  <text start="214.189" dur="5.52">from temptation right in fact we should</text>
  <text start="216.859" dur="5.13">have a zeal and revenge against any sin</text>
  <text start="219.709" dur="3.9">that might try to creep or master us and</text>
  <text start="221.989" dur="6.09">make sure that the master that we do</text>
  <text start="223.609" dur="7.71">have is Yahshua hallelujah but on the</text>
  <text start="228.079" dur="5.4">same token as were submitted to Yahshua</text>
  <text start="231.319" dur="4.32">and we walk in him we don&amp;#39;t get anxious</text>
  <text start="233.479" dur="3.78">about the things of the world we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="235.639" dur="3.391">get anxious about our circumstances</text>
  <text start="237.259" dur="4.5">about life because we have that peace</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="5.4">that he&amp;#39;s given us so you see how that</text>
  <text start="241.759" dur="5.13">works we&amp;#39;re careful when it comes to</text>
  <text start="244.43" dur="5.699">living holy to living pure doing all we</text>
  <text start="246.889" dur="5.791">know to serve Him and that allows us not</text>
  <text start="250.129" dur="4.17">to be careful not to be anxious not to</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="3.66">be worried about all these other things</text>
  <text start="254.299" dur="5.19">that are going on in our lives it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="256.34" dur="4.709">beautiful it&amp;#39;s so beautiful so this week</text>
