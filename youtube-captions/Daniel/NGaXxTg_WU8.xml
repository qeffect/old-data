  <text start="0.03" dur="7.85">Shalom Shalom guys ooh yeah day six ooh</text>
  <text start="4.38" dur="6.03">my voice is I am drinking tea with</text>
  <text start="7.88" dur="5.139">organic raw honey and organic lemons but</text>
  <text start="10.41" dur="4.5">my voice is I gotta keep learning how to</text>
  <text start="13.019" dur="4.26">use the diaphragm so it was a beautiful</text>
  <text start="14.91" dur="3.99">beautiful preaching day because yad just</text>
  <text start="17.279" dur="5.701">beautifully showed the contrast between</text>
  <text start="18.9" dur="5.73">me ministering to this very contrite</text>
  <text start="22.98" dur="2.91">woman who was christian and she actually</text>
  <text start="24.63" dur="3.75">asked a lot of questions she at first</text>
  <text start="25.89" dur="3.99">was sort of skeptical with my method and</text>
  <text start="28.38" dur="3.12">then as I began to explained her I could</text>
  <text start="29.88" dur="3.69">see she started opening up and we had a</text>
  <text start="31.5" dur="3.36">long conversation I wish to have been on</text>
  <text start="33.57" dur="3.48">camera but she did not want to be on</text>
  <text start="34.86" dur="4.379">camera so I had to respect her wishes</text>
  <text start="37.05" dur="3.84">but that was that was a really good</text>
  <text start="39.239" dur="4.101">edifying conversation and then that was</text>
  <text start="40.89" dur="6">compared and contrasted with that</text>
  <text start="43.34" dur="5.02">Jezebel woman that I confronted now some</text>
  <text start="46.89" dur="4.02">people took exception to the the way I</text>
  <text start="48.36" dur="3.99">reacted remember Jesus was completely</text>
  <text start="50.91" dur="4.2">calm and collected as he walked into</text>
  <text start="52.35" dur="4.139">that temple on that Sabbath and then</text>
  <text start="55.11" dur="2.94">when he saw the money changers and the</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="4.471">violation of Shabbat right in the temple</text>
  <text start="58.05" dur="4.8">and all this darkness going on very</text>
  <text start="60.96" dur="3.86">quickly he shifted emotions grabbed that</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="4.589">whip he was completely led by the Spirit</text>
  <text start="64.82" dur="5.17">when you walk in the spirit this happens</text>
  <text start="67.439" dur="5.43">your emotions your will it&amp;#39;s submitted</text>
  <text start="69.99" dur="4.44">to the Almighty God I put in a lot of</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="3.39">hours of Prayer before I go out and</text>
  <text start="74.43" dur="3.96">preach it&amp;#39;s very important and not only</text>
  <text start="76.259" dur="3.841">do I do that but also corporately as a</text>
  <text start="78.39" dur="2.31">group I pray every night with Xoom</text>
  <text start="80.1" dur="2.129">prayer meeting</text>
  <text start="80.7" dur="3.75">so being bathed in prayer is very</text>
  <text start="82.229" dur="3.93">important so make sure when you watch</text>
  <text start="84.45" dur="3.09">things you&amp;#39;re not just thinking like you</text>
  <text start="86.159" dur="3.661">normally would but you&amp;#39;re looking with</text>
  <text start="87.54" dur="4.469">the eyes of the Spirit to understand</text>
  <text start="89.82" dur="4.29">because basically the way I respond to</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="3.451">that woman caused some other people to</text>
  <text start="94.11" dur="2.7">draw up clothes and I was able to</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="3.15">administer to them something that you</text>
  <text start="96.81" dur="3.84">weren&amp;#39;t able to see because it was the</text>
  <text start="98.61" dur="4.38">camera doesn&amp;#39;t seamlessly go from one</text>
  <text start="100.65" dur="3.96">clip to another there&amp;#39;s a gap in some of</text>
  <text start="102.99" dur="3.089">the portions and then at the end of the</text>
  <text start="104.61" dur="4.469">third video I continue to preaching more</text>
  <text start="106.079" dur="4.561">there was one young man who really</text>
  <text start="109.079" dur="2.881">really really was listening to the</text>
  <text start="110.64" dur="3">evidence I was presenting about the</text>
  <text start="111.96" dur="3.659">resurrection which is really cool and</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="3.45">that was all he was drawn because of the</text>
  <text start="115.619" dur="5.311">the conflict between me and this other</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="6.8">this other girl so a heckler can really</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="5.6">be a wonderful thing a wonderful thing</text>
  <text start="123.89" dur="5.009">remember Romans 8:28</text>
  <text start="126.53" dur="4.289">how that works I walk in the spirit not</text>
  <text start="128.899" dur="3.031">in the flesh and if you&amp;#39;re walking in</text>
  <text start="130.819" dur="3.421">the flesh you&amp;#39;re not gonna be a judge</text>
  <text start="131.93" dur="3.84">right and some of you just don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="134.24" dur="3.84">and that&amp;#39;s fine I&amp;#39;m gonna be patient</text>
  <text start="135.77" dur="3.63">because ya been patient with me this is</text>
  <text start="138.08" dur="3.3">a new type of ministry as some of you</text>
  <text start="139.4" dur="4.29">may have never seen before but it is a</text>
  <text start="141.38" dur="4.65">ministry and Judah talks about loving</text>
  <text start="143.69" dur="5.01">with compassion and kindness and then it</text>
  <text start="146.03" dur="4.47">also talks about saving someone with</text>
  <text start="148.7" dur="4.289">fear hating the very garment spotted by</text>
  <text start="150.5" dur="6.18">the flesh so both methods are very much</text>
  <text start="152.989" dur="6.361">used and I use both I use both so in any</text>
  <text start="156.68" dur="4.17">case this was a beautiful wonderful day</text>
  <text start="159.35" dur="3.389">of preaching I&amp;#39;m really happy with the</text>
  <text start="160.85" dur="3.63">sixth day and how it went it is supposed</text>
  <text start="162.739" dur="3.301">to rain tonight and tomorrow but I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="180.05" dur="4.74">of students that were listening and so I</text>
  <text start="182.39" dur="3.84">know that some of the portion couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="184.79" dur="3.62">be heard because of where I set the</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="4.86">camera to kind of see more of the crowd</text>
  <text start="188.41" dur="4.81">and so my back was to the camera so I</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="3.48">understand that but just you know grin</text>
  <text start="193.22" dur="3.269">and bear it until I&amp;#39;m able to get better</text>
