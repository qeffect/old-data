  <text start="73.92" dur="3.809">about the different ways of celebrating</text>
  <text start="75.24" dur="5.01">it but this this year is gonna be</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="7.471">slightly different so I&amp;#39;m gonna start</text>
  <text start="80.25" dur="9.299">off with the main characters in Purim</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="5.79">which are in the book of Esther so the</text>
  <text start="89.549" dur="3.57">three main characters that we have we</text>
  <text start="90.99" dur="7.199">have him of course Esther of whom the</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="7.081">book of Esther is named and her uncle</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="7.14">who&amp;#39;s also the other main character of</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="6.779">her name his name is Mordecai now when</text>
  <text start="105.329" dur="3.271">we first read about Mordechai Esther</text>
  <text start="106.979" dur="3.151">chapter 2 it says now in sucia the</text>
  <text start="108.6" dur="3.99">palace there was a certain Jew whose</text>
  <text start="110.13" dur="5.01">name was Mordecai he was the son of guy</text>
  <text start="112.59" dur="3.87">heir the son of shinai the son of Kish</text>
  <text start="115.14" dur="5.009">of Benjamin</text>
  <text start="116.46" dur="5.31">so he&amp;#39;s from the house of Kish and he</text>
  <text start="120.149" dur="2.911">was a Benjamin I want you to remember</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="4.05">that because that&amp;#39;s going to become very</text>
  <text start="123.06" dur="5.49">very important if we skip forward to the</text>
  <text start="125.82" dur="6.919">other main character in Esther the evil</text>
  <text start="128.55" dur="4.189">guy whose name is Haman</text>
  <text start="133" dur="5.85">says in in Esther chapter 3 says after</text>
  <text start="136.42" dur="5.85">these things in King ah seharris promote</text>
  <text start="138.85" dur="5.19">Haman the son of Hamad otha the Agra guy</text>
  <text start="142.27" dur="7.5">and I want you to remember that as well</text>
  <text start="144.04" dur="7.53">he was an aggregate and advanced Emma</text>
  <text start="149.77" dur="6.69">said this seat above all the princes</text>
  <text start="151.57" dur="7.68">that were with him so just to get the</text>
  <text start="156.46" dur="6">basic narrative down here what happens</text>
  <text start="159.25" dur="5.01">is is that Esther is chosen of many many</text>
  <text start="162.46" dur="5.18">different versions to become the queen</text>
  <text start="164.26" dur="7.23">of the king of Persia ah so Harris and</text>
  <text start="167.64" dur="7.48">and so she is the Queen but this dude</text>
  <text start="171.49" dur="7.32">Haman who&amp;#39;s one of the Royal Nobles in</text>
  <text start="175.12" dur="6.99">in the land he he really despises</text>
  <text start="178.81" dur="5.52">Mordecai because everyone boughs down</text>
  <text start="182.11" dur="4.77">worships a man except Mordecai Mordecai</text>
  <text start="184.33" dur="4.74">refuses to do that and so he gets really</text>
  <text start="186.88" dur="5.34">upset about this and so he goes to the</text>
  <text start="189.07" dur="5.16">king and he says hey look I I want I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="192.22" dur="4.47">even pay you money I&amp;#39;ll pay money if</text>
  <text start="194.23" dur="5.13">you&amp;#39;ll allow me to select the time to</text>
  <text start="196.69" dur="4.95">not only kill Mordecai but all the other</text>
  <text start="199.36" dur="4.32">Jews in the land who refuse to bow down</text>
  <text start="201.64" dur="3.39">before me and the king said sure that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.68" dur="3.87">great sounds like I make a lot of money</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="5.55">well when Mordecai hears about this he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="207.55" dur="5.58">horrified and and he&amp;#39;s walking around in</text>
  <text start="210.58" dur="4.08">sackcloth and ashes and so Esther who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="213.13" dur="3.72">in the royal house is like hey what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.66" dur="5.04">going on what&amp;#39;s going on so he said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.85" dur="4.68">messengers to her uncle and Mordecai</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="3.72">through those messengers tells Esther</text>
  <text start="221.53" dur="3.15">what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on and says like you</text>
  <text start="223.42" dur="4.289">need to go to the king you need to stop</text>
  <text start="224.68" dur="4.77">this and Esther&amp;#39;s like wool I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="227.709" dur="4.621">been called with a king for 30 days and</text>
  <text start="229.45" dur="5.19">if I just go I could die because the</text>
  <text start="232.33" dur="4.71">custom was is if you go to the King on</text>
  <text start="234.64" dur="5.159">your own volition unless he summons you</text>
  <text start="237.04" dur="4.65">could die because when you go to him on</text>
  <text start="239.799" dur="4.381">your own volition if he doesn&amp;#39;t race his</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="5.519">his golden sceptre then it&amp;#39;s off with</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="4.68">your head you&amp;#39;re done and work I says</text>
  <text start="247.209" dur="3.81">well Esther if you&amp;#39;re not going to help</text>
  <text start="248.86" dur="4.02">save the people then you and your</text>
  <text start="251.019" dur="3.871">household will be destroyed and yaa will</text>
  <text start="252.88" dur="5.13">raise up somebody else to save the</text>
  <text start="254.89" dur="5.49">people so Esther says okay I will do</text>
  <text start="258.01" dur="4.33">this so he chichi and she calls for all</text>
  <text start="260.38" dur="3.28">the Jews in the city too fast for</text>
  <text start="262.34" dur="2.91">three days and three nights she doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="263.66" dur="3.39">have any food or water for three days</text>
  <text start="265.25" dur="4.199">and three nights and then she comes</text>
  <text start="267.05" dur="5.52">before the king and the King does lift</text>
  <text start="269.449" dur="5.821">up her his his golden sceptre and and</text>
  <text start="272.57" dur="4.89">receives her and she begins to throw</text>
  <text start="275.27" dur="3.6">these banquets couple banquets for him</text>
  <text start="277.46" dur="3.78">and you can read the whole narrative but</text>
  <text start="278.87" dur="5.43">basically what happens in the end is</text>
  <text start="281.24" dur="6">that Esther reveals Haman as trying to</text>
  <text start="284.3" dur="5.97">destroy her people and the king is of</text>
  <text start="287.24" dur="5.79">course outraged by this and hey Haman</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="5.43">who has built this huge gallows to hang</text>
  <text start="293.03" dur="4.8">Mordecai on because Mordecai would</text>
  <text start="295.7" dur="4.05">refuse to bow down to him Haman winds up</text>
  <text start="297.83" dur="4.8">actually getting hung on those very</text>
  <text start="299.75" dur="5.58">gallows and the letters he had written</text>
  <text start="302.63" dur="4.94">to destroy the Jewish people on those</text>
  <text start="305.33" dur="5.13">days of Purim actually get reversed and</text>
  <text start="307.57" dur="5.86">instead the king&amp;#39;s officers helped the</text>
  <text start="310.46" dur="5.459">Jews to oppress those who were going to</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="4.73">attack them so the whole thing is is</text>
  <text start="315.919" dur="6.331">reversed all that was meant for evil</text>
  <text start="318.16" dur="5.56">becomes meant for good and and so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="322.25" dur="2.58">there&amp;#39;s a lot more details and stuff</text>
  <text start="323.72" dur="4.08">that you can read about if you go</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="4.68">through the book of Esther but Mordecai</text>
  <text start="327.8" dur="3.96">comes from the house from the tribe of</text>
  <text start="329.51" dur="4.86">Benjamin from the house of Kish and</text>
  <text start="331.76" dur="7.1">Haman is an aggie act now I want to go</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="6.57">back in time several hundred years and</text>
  <text start="338.86" dur="5.32">if you go to first</text>
  <text start="340.94" dur="6.409">Samuel we read about the first king of</text>
  <text start="344.18" dur="6.989">Israel his name was Saul and in 1st</text>
  <text start="347.349" dur="7.241">Samuel chapter 9 we see now there was a</text>
  <text start="351.169" dur="5.37">man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="4.71">son of Ivo the son is Aurora the son of</text>
  <text start="356.539" dur="5.88">becharof the son of Aafia a Benjamite a</text>
  <text start="359.3" dur="6.15">mighty man of power and he has sons and</text>
  <text start="362.419" dur="6.201">he had a son whose name was Saul now</text>
  <text start="365.45" dur="6.42">this Saul becomes the first King so Saul</text>
  <text start="368.62" dur="9.31">just like Mordecai is from the tribe of</text>
  <text start="371.87" dur="8.91">Benjamin and his father is Kish so saw</text>
  <text start="377.93" dur="6.6">Mordecai for the same the same tribe</text>
  <text start="380.78" dur="7.35">from the same house now if you know</text>
  <text start="384.53" dur="4.859">about Saul Saul you know for the first</text>
  <text start="388.13" dur="3.99">year he started off pretty good</text>
  <text start="389.389" dur="4.65">but then he basically started doing</text>
  <text start="392.12" dur="2.3">things he started fearing the people</text>
  <text start="394.039" dur="3.441">more</text>
  <text start="394.42" dur="5.76">he started fearing God and so very</text>
  <text start="397.48" dur="7.13">quickly in his reign Saul became a very</text>
  <text start="400.18" dur="8.25">evil dude and refused to obey yah and in</text>
  <text start="404.61" dur="6.82">in chapter 15 verse Samuel 15 it says</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="4.56">Samuel said unto Saul Yahweh sent me to</text>
  <text start="411.43" dur="3.99">anoint you to be king over the people of</text>
  <text start="412.99" dur="4.65">Israel now therefore hearken to the</text>
  <text start="415.42" dur="3.93">voice of the words of Yahweh and thus</text>
  <text start="417.64" dur="4.35">says Yahweh opposed I remember that</text>
  <text start="419.35" dur="5.43">which Melek did Israel Melek were very</text>
  <text start="421.99" dur="4.5">evil evil people and he said how he laid</text>
  <text start="424.78" dur="3.57">wait for him in the way when he came up</text>
  <text start="426.49" dur="4.35">from Egypt now I want you to go and</text>
  <text start="428.35" dur="5.07">smite the milik and utterly destroy all</text>
  <text start="430.84" dur="5.22">they have and spare them not but slay</text>
  <text start="433.42" dur="5.76">both man and woman infant and suckling</text>
  <text start="436.06" dur="4.71">ox and sheep camel and ass and Saul</text>
  <text start="439.18" dur="4.44">gather the people together and numbered</text>
  <text start="440.77" dur="4.62">them into line two hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="443.62" dur="4.35">footmen and ten thousand and of Judah</text>
  <text start="445.39" dur="5.22">and Saul came to a city of a Melek and</text>
  <text start="447.97" dur="4.95">laid wait in the valley and Saul said</text>
  <text start="450.61" dur="4.08">under the key nights go depart get you</text>
  <text start="452.92" dur="3.69">down from among the Amalekites lest I</text>
  <text start="454.69" dur="4.02">destroy you with them for you showed</text>
  <text start="456.61" dur="4.5">kindness to all the children of Israel</text>
  <text start="458.71" dur="3.87">when they came up out of Egypt so the</text>
  <text start="461.11" dur="4.05">key nice departed from among the</text>
  <text start="462.58" dur="5.19">Amalekites and Saul smoked the</text>
  <text start="465.16" dur="4.59">Amalekites from hvala until you come to</text>
  <text start="467.77" dur="5.22">shore that is over against Egypt and</text>
  <text start="469.75" dur="6.84">then he took a gag the king of the</text>
  <text start="472.99" dur="4.95">Amalekites alive and utterly destroyed</text>
  <text start="476.59" dur="4.56">all the people with the edge of the</text>
  <text start="477.94" dur="5.7">sword but saw and the people spared a</text>
  <text start="481.15" dur="4.89">gag oh that&amp;#39;s not what y&amp;#39;all said to do</text>
  <text start="483.64" dur="4.08">and the best of the sheep and of the</text>
  <text start="486.04" dur="3.72">oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs</text>
  <text start="487.72" dur="4.32">and all that was good and would not</text>
  <text start="489.76" dur="4.5">utterly destroy them but everything that</text>
  <text start="492.04" dur="5.25">was vile and refuse that they destroyed</text>
  <text start="494.26" dur="5.28">utterly then came the word of yahwah</text>
  <text start="497.29" dur="5.55">unto Samuel saying it repents me that I</text>
  <text start="499.54" dur="5.01">have set up Saul to be king for he is</text>
  <text start="502.84" dur="3.27">turning back from following me and have</text>
  <text start="504.55" dur="4.47">not performed my commandments and it</text>
  <text start="506.11" dur="9.619">grieved Samuel and he cried unto Yahweh</text>
  <text start="509.02" dur="10.32">all the night so Saul didn&amp;#39;t do what</text>
  <text start="515.729" dur="9.031">Yahweh told him to do through Samuel saw</text>
  <text start="519.34" dur="5.42">wound up sparing the king of a guy</text>
  <text start="525.86" dur="7.88">he didn&amp;#39;t fully obey yeah and he spared</text>
  <text start="530.6" dur="6.81">this evil evil king now Haman</text>
  <text start="533.74" dur="7.539">he&amp;#39;s an aggregate he comes from the</text>
  <text start="537.41" dur="6.51">house of a GAC so because Saul didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="541.279" dur="6.211">obey way back here several hundred years</text>
  <text start="543.92" dur="6.9">earlier now we have another a guy who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="547.49" dur="5.58">risen up and persecuting another man</text>
  <text start="550.82" dur="4.82">who&amp;#39;s of the house of Benjamin with</text>
  <text start="553.07" dur="6.389">summit Kish Mordecai just like Saul was</text>
  <text start="555.64" dur="6.55">but in this case in the book of Esther</text>
  <text start="559.459" dur="5.041">we see a redemption of the house of</text>
  <text start="562.19" dur="5.7">Benjamin because Mordecai and Esther</text>
  <text start="564.5" dur="5.61">they do obey yah they fast and pray they</text>
  <text start="567.89" dur="4.77">persevere they do what God tells me to</text>
  <text start="570.11" dur="7.02">do and so they are able to overcome this</text>
  <text start="572.66" dur="6.929">aggregate Haman so I wanted to I wanted</text>
  <text start="577.13" dur="4.079">to point this out because in our own</text>
  <text start="579.589" dur="3.331">personal lives y&amp;#39;all will tell us to do</text>
  <text start="581.209" dur="3.541">things that if we don&amp;#39;t fully obey Him</text>
  <text start="582.92" dur="3.539">if we don&amp;#39;t do what he tells us to do</text>
  <text start="584.75" dur="4.62">that can cause us to have a lot of</text>
  <text start="586.459" dur="5.491">problems down the road just like it cost</text>
  <text start="589.37" dur="4.98">for Israel because Saul didn&amp;#39;t do what</text>
  <text start="591.95" dur="5.46">y&amp;#39;all told them to do in killing a gag</text>
  <text start="594.35" dur="5.67">you now have this even bigger more dire</text>
  <text start="597.41" dur="4.44">problem that popped up here several</text>
  <text start="600.02" dur="5.22">hundred years later where the entire</text>
  <text start="601.85" dur="4.62">race the Jews was threatened because of</text>
  <text start="605.24" dur="3.96">this advocate</text>
  <text start="606.47" dur="5.91">I saw it just killed a gag and fully</text>
  <text start="609.2" dur="5.61">destroyed this nation is God told him to</text>
  <text start="612.38" dur="5.519">do way back here then you wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="614.81" dur="6.33">had him and pop up several hundred years</text>
  <text start="617.899" dur="5.491">down the road so we need to make sure we</text>
  <text start="621.14" dur="4.41">two are fully obeying the voice of Yana</text>
  <text start="623.39" dur="4.139">we&amp;#39;re doing what he tells us to do</text>
  <text start="625.55" dur="4.59">because if we don&amp;#39;t it will cause</text>
  <text start="627.529" dur="4.56">greater problems down the road</text>
  <text start="630.14" dur="5.25">and that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s always important to</text>
  <text start="632.089" dur="5.25">be obedient to him now what&amp;#39;s beautiful</text>
  <text start="635.39" dur="5.699">about this is despite the greater</text>
  <text start="637.339" dur="5.94">problems that happens down the road we</text>
  <text start="641.089" dur="3.81">still see that because Mordecai and</text>
  <text start="643.279" dur="4.111">Esther were obedient and again you can</text>
  <text start="644.899" dur="4.711">read about this in the book of Esther</text>
  <text start="647.39" dur="4.8">there was redemption redemption was</text>
  <text start="649.61" dur="6.599">brought in the situation so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="652.19" dur="5.85">very it&amp;#39;s a very beautiful thing and I</text>
  <text start="656.209" dur="5.55">think there&amp;#39;s all maybe some parallels</text>
  <text start="658.04" dur="5.52">to the United States as well you know</text>
  <text start="661.759" dur="4.291">because we didn&amp;#39;t deal with problems</text>
  <text start="663.56" dur="4.829">early on several decades ago the deep</text>
  <text start="666.05" dur="6.029">state has become very very entrenched in</text>
  <text start="668.389" dur="5.851">this nation and so circumstances are</text>
  <text start="672.079" dur="4.141">much more dire now than they were</text>
  <text start="674.24" dur="4.529">several decades ago or if we had taken</text>
  <text start="676.22" dur="4.53">care of those things back then if the</text>
  <text start="678.769" dur="3.75">church had really repented and drawn</text>
  <text start="680.75" dur="5.55">close to y&amp;#39;all back then we wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="682.519" dur="6.901">in the situation that we are now but as</text>
  <text start="686.3" dur="5.099">we see through the book of Esther even</text>
  <text start="689.42" dur="4.02">with that things can still be turned</text>
  <text start="691.399" dur="5.521">around now Purim</text>
  <text start="693.44" dur="4.889">you know usually it falls in February so</text>
  <text start="696.92" dur="3.21">this year it&amp;#39;s happening pretty late in</text>
  <text start="698.329" dur="3.721">the year and I think it might be</text>
  <text start="700.13" dur="3.75">prophetic because Purim is always</text>
  <text start="702.05" dur="3.45">usually in the winter and this year it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="703.88" dur="3.72">literally on the last day of winter</text>
  <text start="705.5" dur="5.399">straddling that spring equinox going</text>
  <text start="707.6" dur="7.859">into the spring and so for me seeing it</text>
  <text start="710.899" dur="6.69">that it where the second day is going</text>
  <text start="715.459" dur="5.37">into spring it seems to be prophetic</text>
  <text start="717.589" dur="5.281">that we&amp;#39;re seeing a Purim that is</text>
  <text start="720.829" dur="4.141">leading toward a very great hope and</text>
  <text start="722.87" dur="4.469">expectation you know spring is all about</text>
  <text start="724.97" dur="3.69">life it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the new year begins in</text>
  <text start="727.339" dur="2.94">the spring according to the Scriptures</text>
  <text start="728.66" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s when the month of a V which is</text>
  <text start="730.279" dur="3.661">the first month of the middle year is in</text>
  <text start="732.62" dur="5.07">spring and of course the new year will</text>
  <text start="733.94" dur="5.399">be in April this year so to me Purim</text>
  <text start="737.69" dur="4.44">even though normally it&amp;#39;s prophetically</text>
  <text start="739.339" dur="5.971">tied to the Antichrist and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="742.13" dur="4.769">prophetically tied to the end times I</text>
  <text start="745.31" dur="3.12">think this year what it means is that</text>
  <text start="746.899" dur="3.031">it&amp;#39;s actually tied because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="748.43" dur="3.51">straddling the spring equinox it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="749.93" dur="3.599">literally going to spring we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="751.94" dur="4.98">toward a time of great revival and</text>
  <text start="753.529" dur="6.12">victory and joy that&amp;#39;s what I am that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="756.92" dur="4.859">what I believe so we will see if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="759.649" dur="3.901">right but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="761.779" dur="4.351">what I&amp;#39;m fairly predicting at this point</text>
  <text start="763.55" dur="4.349">as long as we continue as a body Messiah</text>
  <text start="766.13" dur="5.069">here in the United States and across the</text>
  <text start="767.899" dur="6.151">world to pray to press in to pray for</text>
  <text start="771.199" dur="5.341">our president to pray for this nation to</text>
  <text start="774.05" dur="4.709">continue to expose you know the evils</text>
  <text start="776.54" dur="5.19">that are going on around us and as long</text>
  <text start="778.759" dur="4.38">as we are drawing close to him I think</text>
  <text start="781.73" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re gonna see some great great things</text>
  <text start="783.139" dur="6.211">happening here I if you haven&amp;#39;t seen my</text>
  <text start="786.38" dur="4.77">video from last fall piece of Trumpets I</text>
  <text start="789.35" dur="4.14">made a video called prophecy</text>
  <text start="791.15" dur="4.53">pedophiles Trump x marks the spot and I</text>
  <text start="793.49" dur="3.84">believe I believe that because President</text>
  <text start="795.68" dur="4.349">Trump has been elected we&amp;#39;ve given been</text>
  <text start="797.33" dur="4.5">given this reprieve this window where</text>
  <text start="800.029" dur="3.571">the Great Tribulation has been pushed</text>
  <text start="801.83" dur="3.509">back and we have this window where we</text>
  <text start="803.6" dur="5.82">can reach out to the lost like never</text>
  <text start="805.339" dur="6.901">before and so I think that that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="809.42" dur="5.73">that&amp;#39;s what purim falling on the spring</text>
  <text start="812.24" dur="5.19">the spring equinox here symbolizes new</text>
  <text start="815.15" dur="4.41">life new beginnings new birth so I</text>
  <text start="817.43" dur="3.69">wanted to just point this out in the</text>
  <text start="819.56" dur="4.23">scriptures I think it&amp;#39;s very beautiful</text>
  <text start="821.12" dur="4.68">how you know we&amp;#39;re dealing with the</text>
  <text start="823.79" dur="3.42">house of Benjamin the tribe of benjamin</text>
  <text start="825.8" dur="2.039">the house of Kish there&amp;#39;s Redemption</text>
  <text start="827.21" dur="3.33">that happens</text>
  <text start="827.839" dur="4.141">and finally the a guy gets destroyed</text>
  <text start="830.54" dur="3.93">like he should have been destroyed way</text>
  <text start="831.98" dur="4.71">back here in the days of solve it solved</text>
  <text start="834.47" dur="4.619">it no BAE yah but then because of Esther</text>
  <text start="836.69" dur="4.38">and Mordecai&amp;#39;s obedience he&amp;#39;s finally</text>
