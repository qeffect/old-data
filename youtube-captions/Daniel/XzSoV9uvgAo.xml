  <text start="5.67" dur="5.549">12th 2017 and it is now the first day of</text>
  <text start="9.42" dur="4.62">unleavened bread I just wanted to share</text>
  <text start="11.219" dur="6.57">some pictures from the Passover Seder</text>
  <text start="14.04" dur="7.26">dinner that we had yesterday there&amp;#39;s me</text>
  <text start="17.789" dur="6.33">with my staff in my hand as we&amp;#39;re eating</text>
  <text start="21.3" dur="4.68">the Passover had a very joyous effort</text>
  <text start="24.119" dur="4.17">with a lot of a lot of friends was even</text>
  <text start="25.98" dur="4.799">able to invite a co-worker and her</text>
  <text start="28.289" dur="7.02">family to the Passover and it was just</text>
  <text start="30.779" dur="6.751">very festive and joyous event in fact I</text>
  <text start="35.309" dur="4.441">didn&amp;#39;t get back home until midnight last</text>
  <text start="37.53" dur="4.2">night but of course now we begin the</text>
  <text start="39.75" dur="4.44">seven days of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="41.73" dur="4.669">this first day is a high Sabbath and</text>
  <text start="44.19" dur="7.2">then the seventh day will be a high</text>
  <text start="46.399" dur="6.84">Shabbat and as Apostle Paul urges us he</text>
  <text start="51.39" dur="4.14">says let us therefore keep the feast</text>
  <text start="53.239" dur="4.511">with the unleavened bread of sincerity</text>
  <text start="55.53" dur="4.77">and truth you know so many people seem</text>
  <text start="57.75" dur="4.5">to think that Apostle Paul said that we</text>
  <text start="60.3" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t need to keep these feasts but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="62.25" dur="4.17">very clear that not only did he keep the</text>
  <text start="64.26" dur="4.41">feasts but all the early disciples kept</text>
  <text start="66.42" dur="4.62">these feasts because as he also says in</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="5.43">another passage of Scripture these</text>
  <text start="71.04" dur="3.74">feasts are are a shadow of things to</text>
  <text start="74.1" dur="3.33">come</text>
  <text start="74.78" dur="5.26">continuing to teach us things that are</text>
  <text start="77.43" dur="6.27">still yet in the future and he wrote</text>
  <text start="80.04" dur="6.119">that well after the resurrection I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="83.7" dur="4.34">made many many videos in the past about</text>
  <text start="86.159" dur="5.881">Passover and unleavened bread and the</text>
