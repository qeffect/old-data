  <text start="0.03" dur="6.559">okay okay shabbat shalom happy hi</text>
  <text start="4.41" dur="5.729">Sabbath</text>
  <text start="6.589" dur="6.101">this will be a teaching on the seven</text>
  <text start="10.139" dur="5.091">seals seven trumpets seven thunders</text>
  <text start="12.69" dur="4.589">seven bull judgments in Revelation</text>
  <text start="15.23" dur="4.18">basically the best way to understand</text>
  <text start="17.279" dur="6.09">revelation is to have an understanding</text>
  <text start="19.41" dur="6.51">of the Hebrew feast days the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="23.369" dur="5.311">feast days way they&amp;#39;re set up including</text>
  <text start="25.92" dur="6.72">by the way not just the seven Hebrew</text>
  <text start="28.68" dur="5.129">feast days in leviticus 23 but also hope</text>
  <text start="32.64" dur="4.55">you guys can hear me with the heater on</text>
  <text start="33.809" dur="3.381">well let me turn the heater off</text>
  <text start="44.38" dur="3.63">I turn it down so hopefully they&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="46.12" dur="4.38">off pretty soon</text>
  <text start="48.01" dur="3.93">not only the 7-piece days in Leviticus</text>
  <text start="50.5" dur="1.89">23 but also the two that were added</text>
  <text start="51.94" dur="2.58">later</text>
  <text start="52.39" dur="4.53">Purim which has talked about the book of</text>
  <text start="54.52" dur="4.2">Esther and Hanukkah which is in the 1st</text>
  <text start="56.92" dur="4.11">and 2nd book of Maccabees very important</text>
  <text start="58.72" dur="4.019">in storica books Yahshua did celebrate</text>
  <text start="61.03" dur="4.38">Hanukkah by the way if you look it up in</text>
  <text start="62.739" dur="4.471">John 10 verse 22 he went right to the</text>
  <text start="65.41" dur="4.47">temple during the piece of dedication or</text>
  <text start="67.21" dur="5.46">Hanukkah so those are also very</text>
  <text start="69.88" dur="4.95">significant as well so understanding all</text>
  <text start="72.67" dur="4.11">the nine of these feast days are very</text>
  <text start="74.83" dur="5.31">important in understanding how the book</text>
  <text start="76.78" dur="5.43">of Revelation unfolds a lot of this of</text>
  <text start="80.14" dur="4.74">my understanding of this also came from</text>
  <text start="82.21" dur="5.7">Michael rude man macaroon way back in</text>
  <text start="84.88" dur="4.8">2001 he was very anointed back then he</text>
  <text start="87.91" dur="3.15">had a teaching called from here to</text>
  <text start="89.68" dur="4.62">eternity that he had made in the late</text>
  <text start="91.06" dur="6.21">90s early 2000s unfortunately over the</text>
  <text start="94.3" dur="4.74">years Michael Rood has made merchandise</text>
  <text start="97.27" dur="4.41">of the gospel he used to give everything</text>
  <text start="99.04" dur="4.53">away for free and was on the donation</text>
  <text start="101.68" dur="3.93">only basis where people would</text>
  <text start="103.57" dur="4.2">voluntarily send money in at least</text>
  <text start="105.61" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s how he was back in 2001 but he</text>
  <text start="107.77" dur="4.409">has made a business of the gospel</text>
  <text start="110.02" dur="4.799">unfortunately he sells almost all of his</text>
  <text start="112.179" dur="4.5">teachings and so the anointing is left</text>
  <text start="114.819" dur="4.771">him and he has just gotten way whacked</text>
  <text start="116.679" dur="4.44">out a clown we need to pray for him and</text>
  <text start="119.59" dur="4.62">pray that he returns back to his first</text>
  <text start="121.119" dur="5.791">love but some of it comes from him some</text>
  <text start="124.21" dur="5.359">of it&amp;#39;s come from just studying the book</text>
  <text start="126.91" dur="5.01">of Revelation myself and waiting on yah</text>
  <text start="129.569" dur="5.101">learning about Torah implementing Torah</text>
  <text start="131.92" dur="4.86">my life and remember in psalm 119</text>
  <text start="134.67" dur="4.42">there&amp;#39;s a promise and this is for</text>
  <text start="136.78" dur="3.9">everyone not just me but everyone that</text>
  <text start="139.09" dur="3.06">would you obey His commandments you love</text>
  <text start="140.68" dur="3.21">him and keep his Commandments that you</text>
  <text start="142.15" dur="4.62">become wiser than the ancients and you</text>
  <text start="143.89" dur="4.74">behold the deep things that Daniel</text>
  <text start="146.77" dur="4.83">Babylon was able to behold</text>
  <text start="148.63" dur="5.04">in fact Jason who&amp;#39;s part of our prayers</text>
  <text start="151.6" dur="3.33">in meeting the Spirit always leads him</text>
  <text start="153.67" dur="3.12">to post these scriptures as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="154.93" dur="3.15">praying and as we&amp;#39;re fellowshiping and</text>
  <text start="156.79" dur="3.809">that was one of the scriptures I think</text>
  <text start="158.08" dur="4.769">it was from a book it&amp;#39;s from but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.599" dur="4.591">talking about how yah guides his people</text>
  <text start="162.849" dur="5.131">into the deep things so I&amp;#39;m going to lay</text>
  <text start="165.19" dur="4.08">this out revelation can be a very</text>
  <text start="167.98" dur="3.57">difficult book to understand especially</text>
  <text start="169.27" dur="4.47">when you&amp;#39;re divorced from the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="171.55" dur="3.93">Jewish messianic roots of the Christian</text>
  <text start="173.74" dur="3.66">faith so hopefully this will bless you</text>
  <text start="175.48" dur="3.84">the book of Revelation is really neat</text>
  <text start="177.4" dur="3.66">because it&amp;#39;s the only book of the entire</text>
  <text start="179.32" dur="3.6">Bible that says right at the very</text>
  <text start="181.06" dur="3.21">beginning that those who read this book</text>
  <text start="182.92" dur="3.21">are very blessed they get a double</text>
  <text start="184.27" dur="5.22">blessing so hallelujah</text>
  <text start="186.13" dur="5.31">okay let&amp;#39;s get started so we know the</text>
  <text start="189.49" dur="4.23">first part is basically about the seven</text>
  <text start="191.44" dur="4.44">assemblies in Revelation all seven</text>
  <text start="193.72" dur="3.63">assemblies basically there&amp;#39;s many layers</text>
  <text start="195.88" dur="3.72">to them there were seven literal</text>
  <text start="197.35" dur="3.99">assemblies in Asia Minor in the time of</text>
  <text start="199.6" dur="3.99">the first century when Yochanan John</text>
  <text start="201.34" dur="4.14">received this revelation but they also</text>
  <text start="203.59" dur="4.47">represent the seven types of believers</text>
  <text start="205.48" dur="4.77">and you can go back to some of my videos</text>
  <text start="208.06" dur="4.29">that I teach on Philadelphia on Smyrna</text>
  <text start="210.25" dur="3.51">on things like that and learn more about</text>
  <text start="212.35" dur="3.06">those two chapters so I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="213.76" dur="4.08">spend really any time on that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="215.41" dur="7.95">gonna start right off with the first</text>
  <text start="217.84" dur="7.74">seal the white horse now this first seal</text>
  <text start="223.36" dur="6.15">the white horse what&amp;#39;s interesting is</text>
  <text start="225.58" dur="6.57">that in 2017 when we had that first that</text>
  <text start="229.51" dur="5.1">first total solar eclipse that and again</text>
  <text start="232.15" dur="4.47">also before you watch this like I said</text>
  <text start="234.61" dur="4.82">with all my prophetic videos you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="236.62" dur="5.31">posit right now and go watch the video</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="4.57">prophecy pedophiles Trump</text>
  <text start="241.93" dur="4.47">x marks the spot otherwise this is gonna</text>
  <text start="244" dur="5.03">make no sense so make sure you pause it</text>
  <text start="246.4" dur="6.54">and go go watch that video first</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="6.55">so in 2017 it was a jubilee we had that</text>
  <text start="252.94" dur="5.389">total solar eclipse and of course this</text>
  <text start="255.58" dur="5.309">was Trump&amp;#39;s first year as president</text>
  <text start="258.329" dur="4.631">Trump was directly tied to this Jubilee</text>
  <text start="260.889" dur="4.321">year because for the first time in</text>
  <text start="262.96" dur="3.69">history a United States president not</text>
  <text start="265.21" dur="3.989">only recognized Jerusalem as the capital</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="5.1">of Israel but moved the embassy from Tel</text>
  <text start="269.199" dur="5.28">Aviv down to Jerusalem which is going to</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="4.889">play into the preparations for this</text>
  <text start="274.479" dur="3.81">Third Temple for example by the way that</text>
  <text start="276.639" dur="4.471">we should have nothing to do with and</text>
  <text start="278.289" dur="5.551">I&amp;#39;ll get into that later okay so the</text>
  <text start="281.11" dur="5.19">first seal is this white horse and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.84" dur="5.13">basically representative of the Trump</text>
  <text start="286.3" dur="4.86">administration you notice the signs of</text>
  <text start="288.97" dur="3.87">Trumper are always white a lot of them</text>
  <text start="291.16" dur="4.08">are white with some other colors</text>
  <text start="292.84" dur="3.72">sometimes blue well on white it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="295.24" dur="3.929">Trump presidency right here&amp;#39;s the white</text>
  <text start="296.56" dur="4.41">horse now people are wrongly say oh that</text>
  <text start="299.169" dur="3.181">white horse is the Antichrist no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.97" dur="3.54">not the son of perdition is</text>
  <text start="302.35" dur="3.69">didn&amp;#39;t come in until the fifth trumpet</text>
  <text start="304.51" dur="2.3">and we&amp;#39;re going to get into that but</text>
  <text start="306.04" dur="3.12">this is the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="306.81" dur="4.8">represented in this first seal and this</text>
  <text start="309.16" dur="6.12">is what opens everything up hallelujah</text>
  <text start="311.61" dur="6.1">okay so as I talked about in my previous</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="7.38">videos Trump is taking down the old</text>
  <text start="317.71" dur="7.41">Cabal the jesuit vatican all that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="322.66" dur="4.86">connected to the Clintons the bush cabal</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="4.44">the jesuit vatican cabal&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="327.52" dur="4.2">connected to Islam all that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="329.56" dur="4.71">be getting taken down over the next two</text>
  <text start="331.72" dur="5.37">terms of Trump&amp;#39;s glorious presidency in</text>
  <text start="334.27" dur="4.05">this white horse and that old cabal will</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="2.49">come crashing down there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="338.32" dur="4.65">great revival we&amp;#39;re already starting to</text>
  <text start="339.58" dur="4.56">see it on Awakening but there is going</text>
  <text start="342.97" dur="4.44">to be that three and a half year Great</text>
  <text start="344.14" dur="5.31">Tribulation we&amp;#39;re a new cabal will arise</text>
  <text start="347.41" dur="5.46">toward the end of Trump&amp;#39;s presidency in</text>
  <text start="349.45" dur="6.15">2024 when we get to that second solar</text>
  <text start="352.87" dur="5.1">eclipse and that happens in the spring</text>
  <text start="355.6" dur="8.28">of 2024 right a couple days before the</text>
  <text start="357.97" dur="7.17">Hebrew New Year on April 8th 2024 so</text>
  <text start="363.88" dur="2.01">we&amp;#39;ve got this amount of time to get our</text>
  <text start="365.14" dur="4.5">house in order</text>
  <text start="365.89" dur="11.16">all right now that second seal the Red</text>
  <text start="369.64" dur="8.87">Horse red we&amp;#39;re gonna get red China and</text>

  <text start="382.81" dur="3.75">China is will strike America without</text>
  <text start="384.67" dur="5.1">warning it&amp;#39;s prophesied by Dmitry Duda</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="5.4">Minh Henry Gruver is prophesied by David</text>
  <text start="389.77" dur="4.08">Wilkerson it&amp;#39;s going to happen it will</text>
  <text start="391.96" dur="4.02">happen it will strike the United States</text>
  <text start="393.85" dur="3.95">without warning with nuclear war and we</text>
  <text start="395.98" dur="4.53">will be annihilated the United States</text>
  <text start="397.8" dur="5.5">England and France boom the three horns</text>
  <text start="400.51" dur="5.28">are uprooted so that&amp;#39;ll be the second</text>
  <text start="403.3" dur="4.83">seal that will probably happen now again</text>
  <text start="405.79" dur="3.75">in terms of the order of things</text>
  <text start="408.13" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s scriptural but in terms of the</text>
  <text start="409.54" dur="5.61">actual dates this is all predicated on</text>
  <text start="411.61" dur="6.6">my theory about the two solar eclipses</text>
  <text start="415.15" dur="5.64">so just just keep that in mind so okay</text>
  <text start="418.21" dur="4.89">so we got the second seal it&amp;#39;s this huge</text>

  <text start="596.31" dur="5.07">and smoke of this World War three we</text>
  <text start="599.85" dur="4.59">have the son of perdition that arises</text>
  <text start="601.38" dur="5.22">and in the fifth trumpet Marita takes</text>
  <text start="604.44" dur="4.29">him five months to consolidate his power</text>
  <text start="606.6" dur="3.93">over the earth so now I have the ashes</text>
  <text start="608.73" dur="3.48">and smoke of this nuclear the war that</text>
  <text start="610.53" dur="4.62">happens at some point for the end of</text>
  <text start="612.21" dur="6.12">Trump&amp;#39;s second term we have the son of</text>
  <text start="615.15" dur="4.98">perdition who rises and he looks very</text>
  <text start="618.33" dur="3.45">much like the Messiah it says in the</text>
  <text start="620.13" dur="3.54">scriptures that if it were possible even</text>
  <text start="621.78" dur="3.81">the very elect would be deceived by him</text>
  <text start="623.67" dur="3.24">and I have a whole teaching about the</text>
  <text start="625.59" dur="3.87">son of perdition if you want to go look</text>
  <text start="626.91" dur="4.62">at that Yahshua and Apostle Paul rabbi</text>
  <text start="629.46" dur="4.68">shul very clearly identified who the son</text>
  <text start="631.53" dur="4.74">of perdition is so he rises out of the</text>
  <text start="634.14" dur="5.24">smoking ashes and so for five months it</text>
  <text start="636.27" dur="6.06">takes him to consolidate his power over</text>
  <text start="639.38" dur="5.59">the earth and he has been a rule and</text>
  <text start="642.33" dur="4.17">reign from Israel the United States has</text>
  <text start="644.97" dur="5.07">been knocked out Russia and China are</text>
  <text start="646.5" dur="5.1">badly wounded and so Israel replaces</text>
  <text start="650.04" dur="3.33">that power vacuum it begins to take over</text>
  <text start="651.6" dur="4.02">the earth laying a foundation by the way</text>
  <text start="653.37" dur="3.63">for when the true Messiah returns but</text>
  <text start="655.62" dur="2.73">this of course is the counterfeit the</text>
  <text start="657" dur="5.67">counterfeit millennium that we enter</text>
  <text start="658.35" dur="8.07">into so John describes these locusts and</text>
  <text start="662.67" dur="6.81">I&amp;#39;ll get my scriptures here oh did I</text>
  <text start="666.42" dur="10.56">leave my Bible in the car I think I did</text>
  <text start="669.48" dur="9.6">oh no here it is okay John describes his</text>
  <text start="676.98" dur="4.11">locusts and again remember he is from</text>
  <text start="679.08" dur="4.29">the first century describing things that</text>
  <text start="681.09" dur="3.99">he&amp;#39;s seen from the 21st century I want</text>
  <text start="683.37" dur="3.48">to read what he describes that comes out</text>
  <text start="685.08" dur="5.72">of the ashes and smoke of this nuke of</text>
  <text start="686.85" dur="3.95">the war it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="695.83" dur="4.87">remember this is where the bottomless</text>
  <text start="697.67" dur="6.06">pits opens and out of the ocean smack</text>
  <text start="700.7" dur="4.62">smoke it comes out this the stuff it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="703.73" dur="3.27">not going to kill those who are truly</text>
  <text start="705.32" dur="3.42">sealed by aquas remember the</text>
  <text start="707" dur="3.15">Philadelphia Saints during this time are</text>
  <text start="708.74" dur="4.71">getting into the safe place without</text>
  <text start="710.15" dur="4.65">three and a half year period so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="713.45" dur="4.05">why I says I won&amp;#39;t be able to kill them</text>
  <text start="714.8" dur="4.17">but it says in those days men shall seek</text>
  <text start="717.5" dur="3.84">death to not be able to find it because</text>
  <text start="718.97" dur="4.26">these people think there are these</text>
  <text start="721.34" dur="5.49">monsters they&amp;#39;re not monsters I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="723.23" dur="5.04">explain what these are the shape of the</text>
  <text start="726.83" dur="3.87">locusts were like unto horses prepared</text>
  <text start="728.27" dur="4.14">unto battle and on their heads were as</text>
  <text start="730.7" dur="4.53">it were crowns like gold and their faces</text>
  <text start="732.41" dur="5.97">were as the faces of men so if you study</text>
  <text start="735.23" dur="5.37">these Apache Israeli helicopters two men</text>
  <text start="738.38" dur="5.52">two men sit in it they have faces like</text>
  <text start="740.6" dur="6.89">men their hair is the hair of women one</text>
  <text start="743.9" dur="6.12">below the level he sees us flying here</text>
  <text start="747.49" dur="4.48">their teeth raise the teeth of lions the</text>
  <text start="750.02" dur="4.98">Hellfire sinking missiles that these</text>
  <text start="751.97" dur="4.02">Apache helicopters are armed with they</text>
  <text start="755" dur="3">had breastplates as it were breastplates</text>
  <text start="755.99" dur="3.6">of iron and the sounds of their wings</text>
  <text start="758" dur="3.51">were as the sound of chariots of many</text>
  <text start="759.59" dur="4.41">horses running to battle if you&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="761.51" dur="5.22">heard an armada maybe not on is not a</text>
  <text start="764" dur="5.37">good tournaments for the sea a fleet of</text>
  <text start="766.73" dur="4.74">these Apache war helicopters pounding</text>
  <text start="769.37" dur="3.93">across the sky it sounds exactly like</text>
  <text start="771.47" dur="4.47">that the sound of chariots of many</text>
  <text start="773.3" dur="4.23">horses running to battle and they had</text>
  <text start="775.94" dur="3.03">tails like unto scorpions and their</text>
  <text start="777.53" dur="4.02">stings in their tails and their power</text>
  <text start="778.97" dur="4.74">was to hurt men five months so basically</text>
  <text start="781.55" dur="4.44">the son of perdition sends out this army</text>
  <text start="783.71" dur="4.41">of Apache helicopters from the smoke and</text>
  <text start="785.99" dur="4.8">ash of the World War three consolidates</text>
  <text start="788.12" dur="3.87">his power across the earth men can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="790.79" dur="2.64">kill themselves because they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="791.99" dur="3.03">captured and put it into concentration</text>
  <text start="793.43" dur="4.08">camps into FEMA camps and things all</text>
  <text start="795.02" dur="4.05">over the earth at least those who are</text>
  <text start="797.51" dur="3.96">resisting and not wanting to take the</text>
  <text start="799.07" dur="5.49">mark of the beast so it takes him five</text>
  <text start="801.47" dur="4.92">months to to consolidate to consolidate</text>
  <text start="804.56" dur="3.33">his power and so these are helicopters</text>
  <text start="806.39" dur="4.17">that John is describing the best way he</text>
  <text start="807.89" dur="5.49">can being in the first century that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="810.56" dur="7.95">the best way he can describe it is the</text>
  <text start="813.38" dur="10.26">way that we see it in Revelation then</text>
  <text start="818.51" dur="6.96">when we come to the sixth seal this is</text>
  <text start="823.64" dur="2.42">talking about where a third of manner</text>
  <text start="825.47" dur="3.62">are</text>
  <text start="826.06" dur="5.1">are basically wiped out and this sick</text>
  <text start="829.09" dur="4.26">seal actually happens way way way way</text>
  <text start="831.16" dur="5.49">toward the end of the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="833.35" dur="5.37">when China after licking its wounds for</text>
  <text start="836.65" dur="3.78">three and a half years and Russia they</text>
  <text start="838.72" dur="3.99">both strike you read about this also in</text>
  <text start="840.43" dur="4.47">Daniel 11 where the son of perdition</text>
  <text start="842.71" dur="3.78">ruling in Israel says he hears troubling</text>
  <text start="844.9" dur="3.81">tidings from the east and from the north</text>
  <text start="846.49" dur="4.35">for both China and Russia and he goes</text>
  <text start="848.71" dur="3.51">out and wipes them out that was for the</text>
  <text start="850.84" dur="5.37">end of the Great Tribulation so that</text>
  <text start="852.22" dur="5.46">sixth seal is describing that time when</text>
  <text start="856.21" dur="3.6">the way of the kings of the east were</text>
  <text start="857.68" dur="4.77">made and that China Army comes across</text>
  <text start="859.81" dur="4.68">and if you read again it&amp;#39;s describing</text>
  <text start="862.45" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;ll just read it again he says it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="864.49" dur="3.75">army of two hundred thousand thousand</text>
  <text start="866.74" dur="4.38">which is about the size of the army of</text>
  <text start="868.24" dur="5.28">China which that is you know two hundred</text>
  <text start="871.12" dur="3.78">million men and thus I saw the horses in</text>
  <text start="873.52" dur="2.88">the vision and then that sat on them</text>
  <text start="874.9" dur="3.6">having breastplates of fire and of</text>
  <text start="876.4" dur="3.78">jassi&amp;#39;s and brimstone and the heads of</text>
  <text start="878.5" dur="3.27">the horses were as the heads of lions so</text>
  <text start="880.18" dur="3.54">they sit back like a head of a lion and</text>
  <text start="881.77" dur="3.69">out of their mouths issued fire smoke</text>
  <text start="883.72" dur="4.92">and brimstone he&amp;#39;s describing tanks</text>
  <text start="885.46" dur="5.07">these massive tanks by these three were</text>
  <text start="888.64" dur="3.48">the third men killed by fire and smoke</text>
  <text start="890.53" dur="4.23">and brimstone which issued out of their</text>
  <text start="892.12" dur="6.8">mouths so he&amp;#39;s describing these tanks</text>
  <text start="894.76" dur="6.54">rolling across from China to to attack</text>
  <text start="898.92" dur="3.85">the son of perdition in Israel and</text>
  <text start="901.3" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re wiped out and a third of men are</text>
  <text start="902.77" dur="5.07">wiped out so you can read about that</text>
  <text start="905.26" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s talked about in there and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="907.84" dur="5.52">that happens that&amp;#39;s that that 6:36</text>
  <text start="910.75" dur="7.53">trumpet happens way toward the end of</text>
  <text start="913.36" dur="7.5">the tribulation so you got three and a</text>
  <text start="918.28" dur="5.85">half years between the fifth trumpet and</text>
  <text start="920.86" dur="4.59">the sixth trumpet now before we get to</text>
  <text start="924.13" dur="5.04">the seventh trumpet there are these</text>
  <text start="925.45" dur="6.03">seven thunders and the scripture says</text>
  <text start="929.17" dur="3.84">that we don&amp;#39;t know what these are John</text>
  <text start="931.48" dur="4.05">was about to write it down and yah said</text>
  <text start="933.01" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t do it we know in the book of songs</text>
  <text start="935.53" dur="3.96">that yah speaks with a voice of thunder</text>
  <text start="937.18" dur="4.07">I suspect these seven thunders are</text>
  <text start="939.49" dur="4.02">instructions given to the two witnesses</text>
  <text start="941.25" dur="4.96">Apostle John apostle Enoch if you</text>
  <text start="943.51" dur="4.68">haven&amp;#39;t wast watch my YouTube on the two</text>
  <text start="946.21" dur="3.3">witnesses please go watch it</text>
  <text start="948.19" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s called Philadelphia the two</text>
  <text start="949.51" dur="4.2">witnesses and forget what else but</text>
  <text start="951.7" dur="3.33">Apostle John and Enoch all right I</text>
  <text start="953.71" dur="3">believe that the two witnesses and they</text>
  <text start="955.03" dur="2.48">get special instructions seven thunders</text>
  <text start="956.71" dur="2.36">that are only</text>
  <text start="957.51" dur="2.76">to them because they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="959.07" dur="3.21">preaching for those three half years</text>
  <text start="960.27" dur="4.8">that the Philadelphians are in the same</text>
  <text start="962.28" dur="4.74">place and the rest of the remnant of her</text>
  <text start="965.07" dur="5.49">seed the rest of the the church is</text>
  <text start="967.02" dur="5.55">persecuted body believers I should say</text>
  <text start="970.56" dur="3.54">not use the word Church okay so those</text>
  <text start="972.57" dur="3.21">seven thunders are a mystery we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="974.1" dur="4.68">know what they are probably instructions</text>
  <text start="975.78" dur="5.04">given to the two witnesses and then</text>
  <text start="978.78" dur="5.31">after those seven thunders we finally</text>
  <text start="980.82" dur="4.71">come to the seventh Trump which is the</text>
  <text start="984.09" dur="3.3">resurrection this is described in</text>
  <text start="985.53" dur="3.96">Revelation 10 and 11 I have a whole</text>
  <text start="987.39" dur="4.11">teaching on why this is the seventh</text>
  <text start="989.49" dur="4.47">Trump reaction on it happens in the days</text>
  <text start="991.5" dur="3.45">of between yom teruah and yom kippur so</text>
  <text start="993.96" dur="2.82">why we don&amp;#39;t know the day or the hour</text>
  <text start="994.95" dur="3.78">because there&amp;#39;s 10 days between yom</text>
  <text start="996.78" dur="3.03">teruah and yom kippur but sometime in</text>
  <text start="998.73" dur="2.94">those days that&amp;#39;s where the two</text>
  <text start="999.81" dur="4.02">witnesses are murdered and rise up all</text>
  <text start="1001.67" dur="4.05">the dead Messiah rise up we who are</text>
  <text start="1003.83" dur="3.78">alive and remain rise up we go up to the</text>
  <text start="1005.72" dur="3.6">clouds and the only really way to</text>
  <text start="1007.61" dur="4.47">survive and be one of those few who are</text>
  <text start="1009.32" dur="4.08">alive and remain who loved Yahshua is to</text>
  <text start="1012.08" dur="3.15">make sure you grab ahold of that promise</text>
  <text start="1013.4" dur="3.57">in Philadelphia which I talked about in</text>
  <text start="1015.23" dur="3.87">previous videos again you&amp;#39;ll have to go</text>
  <text start="1016.97" dur="3.51">watch those as they just understand so</text>
  <text start="1019.1" dur="3.12">the seventh trumpet resurrection happens</text>
  <text start="1020.48" dur="4.349">right toward the end of the</text>
  <text start="1022.22" dur="6.119">three-and-a-half year tribulation right</text>
  <text start="1024.829" dur="5.851">toward the end okay and then once we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1028.339" dur="4.681">up there for those 10 days you know we</text>
  <text start="1030.68" dur="3.84">go up and we only get our rewards on Yom</text>
  <text start="1033.02" dur="4.05">Kippur and we&amp;#39;re up in the heavenlies</text>
  <text start="1034.52" dur="5.16">down below during those ten Days of Awe</text>
  <text start="1037.07" dur="4.35">you got the seven bowl judgments that</text>
  <text start="1039.68" dur="4.38">are poured out this is the wrath of yah</text>
  <text start="1041.42" dur="4.8">this is where the beasts kingdom is cast</text>
  <text start="1044.06" dur="3.75">into darkness for three days or not</text>
  <text start="1046.22" dur="3.45">maybe not three days but it happens very</text>
  <text start="1047.81" dur="4.17">quickly one on top of another because</text>
  <text start="1049.67" dur="4.74">two of the plagues talked about all the</text>
  <text start="1051.98" dur="4.11">blood both the rivers freshwater and</text>
  <text start="1054.41" dur="4.05">oceans all the water being turned to</text>
  <text start="1056.09" dur="4.05">blood man can&amp;#39;t survive long without</text>
  <text start="1058.46" dur="3.99">water especially if you&amp;#39;re not prepared</text>
  <text start="1060.14" dur="4.08">for it and so these plagues happen very</text>
  <text start="1062.45" dur="4.74">quickly probably all within those 10</text>
  <text start="1064.22" dur="5.49">days of awe as yaws you know making</text>
  <text start="1067.19" dur="5.49">atonement on the earth cleansing the</text>
  <text start="1069.71" dur="4.53">earth of the beastly Kingdom oh then we</text>
  <text start="1072.68" dur="3.57">come to yom kippur where we get our</text>
  <text start="1074.24" dur="3.84">gifts and we&amp;#39;re gonna be preparing them</text>
  <text start="1076.25" dur="4.17">for the wedding feasts of the land the</text>

  <text start="1080.42" dur="4.44">down below the son of perdition and now</text>
  <text start="1083.39" dur="2.82">his armies are severely weakened because</text>
  <text start="1084.86" dur="3.69">of all these judgments these little</text>
  <text start="1086.21" dur="4.99">judgments that have happened he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1088.55" dur="4.45">preparing his armies to gather</text>
  <text start="1091.2" dur="4.26">because he&amp;#39;s telling he&amp;#39;s deceiving them</text>

  <text start="1095.46" dur="5.85">to wreak havoc on his true kingdom and</text>
  <text start="1098.49" dur="6.45">so he&amp;#39;s gathering his armies to him okay</text>
  <text start="1101.31" dur="5.13">and then the feasts of Sukkot of course</text>
  <text start="1104.94" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re having the wedding supper of the</text>

  <text start="1115.89" dur="3.03">you know there&amp;#39;s this been this massive</text>

  <text start="1183.96" dur="3.87">be having the babies and populating the</text>
  <text start="1185.82" dur="3.54">earth during the Millennial Kingdom that</text>
  <text start="1187.83" dur="3.15">will then begin and we and our</text>
  <text start="1189.36" dur="3.69">resurrected bodies we&amp;#39;ve returned to</text>
  <text start="1190.98" dur="3.75">Earth with Yahshua we&amp;#39;re now ruling and</text>
  <text start="1193.05" dur="3.96">reigning with him for this one thousand</text>
  <text start="1194.73" dur="4.08">years that&amp;#39;s described in zechariah 14</text>
  <text start="1197.01" dur="6.33">and then the last four chapters of</text>
  <text start="1198.81" dur="7.53">ezekiel and in Malachi 3 so this is this</text>
  <text start="1203.34" dur="4.92">is what we&amp;#39;re talking about so I know I</text>
  <text start="1206.34" dur="3.36">put a lot of information very fast so</text>
  <text start="1208.26" dur="4.2">you can go through this video and pause</text>
  <text start="1209.7" dur="4.44">and then read the passes in Scripture</text>
  <text start="1212.46" dur="3.45">remember in Revelation also there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1214.14" dur="3.75">lot of parentheticals what I mean by</text>
  <text start="1215.91" dur="3.78">that is there&amp;#39;s pauses in the narrative</text>
  <text start="1217.89" dur="3.84">for these parentheticals that sort of</text>
  <text start="1219.69" dur="3.36">jump around in time there&amp;#39;s like a pause</text>
  <text start="1221.73" dur="1.99">for at the beginning</text>
  <text start="1223.05" dur="1.96">where</text>
  <text start="1223.72" dur="2.54">it&amp;#39;s really talking about a time that</text>
  <text start="1225.01" dur="3.6">happens in the new heavens and new earth</text>
  <text start="1226.26" dur="4.39">there&amp;#39;s these parentheticals okay so</text>
  <text start="1228.61" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t let that confuse you there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1230.65" dur="7.5">pauses and see lots but overall the</text>
  <text start="1233.65" dur="5.85">seals the the the six trumpets then the</text>
  <text start="1238.15" dur="3.99">seven thunders and the seventh trumpet</text>
  <text start="1239.5" dur="5.039">then the seven bowl judgments the return</text>
  <text start="1242.14" dur="4.47">of Yahshua it all unfolds like a</text>
  <text start="1244.539" dur="3.541">narrative if you understand the feast</text>
  <text start="1246.61" dur="3.75">days if you understand the feast days</text>
  <text start="1248.08" dur="4.17">because especially toward the end yom</text>
  <text start="1250.36" dur="4.26">teruah yom kippur the feasts of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="1252.25" dur="5.19">those all come into play and even Purim</text>
  <text start="1254.62" dur="4.59">comes into play because Purim Yahshua</text>
  <text start="1257.44" dur="4.14">says pray that your flight be not on a</text>
  <text start="1259.21" dur="4.29">Sabbath or winter for when it is Great</text>
  <text start="1261.58" dur="3.87">Tribulation will begin and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1263.5" dur="3.27">interesting that in Perm in 2024 which</text>
  <text start="1265.45" dur="3.51">happens before the separate thing</text>
  <text start="1266.77" dur="3.029">actually does happen on a weekly Shabbat</text>
  <text start="1268.96" dur="2.73">that year</text>
  <text start="1269.799" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s a Saturday and Sunday so it</text>
  <text start="1271.69" dur="3.96">actually happens on a weekly Shabbat</text>
  <text start="1273.039" dur="5.341">Purim so the interesting to see if my</text>
  <text start="1275.65" dur="4.68">theory is right about 2024 but if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1278.38" dur="4.71">the case you know it&amp;#39;s a three and a</text>
  <text start="1280.33" dur="4.53">half year Great Tribulation it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1283.09" dur="3.719">seven years guys there are seven years</text>
  <text start="1284.86" dur="3.809">in Daniel Yahshua fulfilled the first</text>
  <text start="1286.809" dur="4.081">three and a half years he did it he was</text>
  <text start="1288.669" dur="3.99">cut off in the midst he was cut off on</text>
  <text start="1290.89" dur="3.63">Passover 2,000 years ago he fulfilled</text>
  <text start="1292.659" dur="3.451">those three and a half years but the</text>
  <text start="1294.52" dur="4.35">remaining three nine years are now for</text>
  <text start="1296.11" dur="4.83">the counterfeit Messiah and so you got</text>
  <text start="1298.87" dur="3.45">from spring of 2024 three and a half</text>
  <text start="1300.94" dur="4.65">years later you come to the fall feast</text>
  <text start="1302.32" dur="6.78">of 2027 again that&amp;#39;s all predicated on</text>
  <text start="1305.59" dur="6.69">my theory of the two these two solar</text>
  <text start="1309.1" dur="4.439">eclipses indicating that final seven</text>
  <text start="1312.28" dur="2.55">years of America and then you got the</text>
  <text start="1313.539" dur="3.12">three and a few Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="1314.83" dur="3.39">I could be wrong on that but definitely</text>
  <text start="1316.659" dur="3.331">the order of things and how they</text>
  <text start="1318.22" dur="4.05">progress it&amp;#39;s very clear when you</text>
  <text start="1319.99" dur="4.53">understand the Hebrew feast days and</text>
