  <text start="4.95" dur="4.59">podcast is being recorded on the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="7.29" dur="6.54">day the seventh day of the week Saturday</text>
  <text start="9.54" dur="7.02">August the 23rd 2014 we&amp;#39;re only a few</text>
  <text start="13.83" dur="4.8">days away now from the end of the month</text>
  <text start="16.56" dur="4.379">of off which is the fifth hebrew month</text>
  <text start="18.63" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s going to be a new moon just a</text>
  <text start="20.939" dur="4.801">few days from now and this new moon is</text>
  <text start="23.55" dur="3.69">very special because it begins what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="25.74" dur="4.379">known in Scripture is the month of Elul</text>
  <text start="27.24" dur="4.439">it&amp;#39;s the six month which the six month</text>
  <text start="30.119" dur="5.311">of course the number six comes before</text>
  <text start="31.679" dur="7.97">the number seven so this next month will</text>
  <text start="35.43" dur="7.5">be the countdown leading to yom teruah</text>
  <text start="39.649" dur="6.791">yom teruah the feast of trumpets which</text>
  <text start="42.93" dur="6.42">is the first of the fall feasts so in</text>
  <text start="46.44" dur="4.799">jewish tradition the month of Elul the</text>
  <text start="49.35" dur="5.79">six month is known as the month of</text>
  <text start="51.239" dur="7.201">repentance month in which the Jewish</text>
  <text start="55.14" dur="7.71">people would habitually prepare</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="5.999">themselves in repentance to so that they</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="3.6">can enter into the season of the fall</text>
  <text start="64.439" dur="5.341">feasts which begins the following of the</text>
  <text start="66.45" dur="5.22">seventh month with a right heart so I</text>
  <text start="69.78" dur="4.409">thought it would be very appropriate to</text>
  <text start="71.67" dur="5.22">make a podcast today on this final</text>
  <text start="74.189" dur="6.151">Sabbath just before the sixth month</text>
  <text start="76.89" dur="6.18">starts before the new moon about the</text>
  <text start="80.34" dur="8.22">nature of the blood of Yahshua and true</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="8.759">repentance we know that the blood of</text>
  <text start="88.56" dur="5.97">Yahshua his shed blood that He shed for</text>
  <text start="91.829" dur="5.341">us 2,000 years ago is the only way that</text>
  <text start="94.53" dur="5.629">kind of tone for our sins when we have</text>
  <text start="97.17" dur="4.98">sinned no matter what kind of sin it is</text>
  <text start="100.159" dur="5.74">there&amp;#39;s nothing that we can do at that</text>
  <text start="102.15" dur="5.82">point to make up for that soon you know</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="5.491">that soon we&amp;#39;ve done we&amp;#39;ve committed it</text>
  <text start="107.97" dur="5.49">we the penalty is eternal death for that</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="4.89">sin or sins that that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="113.46" dur="4.86">practicing or living in and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="5.04">nothing at that point that we can do to</text>
  <text start="118.32" dur="5.759">make up for it only the blood of Yahshua</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="5.92">only his shed blood applied to our lives</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="6.581">can wash away that sent can</text>
  <text start="127.24" dur="5.55">can can take to take it away so in that</text>
  <text start="130.66" dur="3.9">sense it is very very true very very</text>
  <text start="132.79" dur="4.89">biblical in most Christians and messy</text>
  <text start="134.56" dur="5.55">annex understand that the only way we</text>
  <text start="137.68" dur="6.059">can have our sins washed away is through</text>
  <text start="140.11" dur="7.47">his blood through his atonement that he</text>
  <text start="143.739" dur="6.78">offers to us however after he has</text>
  <text start="147.58" dur="5.22">cleanse us from our sin after he is</text>
  <text start="150.519" dur="4.701">taken care of that which we cannot take</text>
  <text start="152.8" dur="6.21">care of ourselves that we need is mercy</text>
  <text start="155.22" dur="6.64">you know we then have to take active</text>
  <text start="159.01" dur="5.34">steps to make sure that we continue with</text>
  <text start="161.86" dur="4.439">a repentant heart that we continue to</text>
  <text start="164.35" dur="5.25">walk in the purity that he and he alone</text>
  <text start="166.299" dur="5.97">has allowed us to begin in and what I</text>
  <text start="169.6" dur="5.13">mean by that is for example if you take</text>
  <text start="172.269" dur="5.821">the statement that Yahshua makes in the</text>
  <text start="174.73" dur="6.539">Gospels where he says if your eye causes</text>
  <text start="178.09" dur="6.119">you to sin gouge it out if your hand</text>
  <text start="181.269" dur="4.621">causes you to sin then cut it off and of</text>
  <text start="184.209" dur="3.481">course Yahshua&amp;#39;s not speaking literally</text>
  <text start="185.89" dur="4.23">he&amp;#39;s speaking metaphorically but</text>
  <text start="187.69" dur="6.299">basically what he&amp;#39;s saying is is if</text>
  <text start="190.12" dur="6.33">there is any type of habit or thing that</text>
  <text start="193.989" dur="4.911">you do or people that you associate with</text>
  <text start="196.45" dur="5.94">our places that you go or whatever that</text>
  <text start="198.9" dur="6.309">would cause you to go into a period of</text>
  <text start="202.39" dur="4.409">temptation and lead you back into the</text>
  <text start="205.209" dur="4.59">sin that he&amp;#39;s redeemed you from you need</text>
  <text start="206.799" dur="5.791">to get rid of those things so for</text>
  <text start="209.799" dur="5.121">example if you take say someone who was</text>
  <text start="212.59" dur="4.2">a drunkard before he came to know yeah</text>
  <text start="214.92" dur="6.129">you know you had a problem with alcohol</text>
  <text start="216.79" dur="7.65">and would get drunk of course there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.049" dur="5.821">nothing that drunkard can do to atone</text>
  <text start="224.44" dur="4.68">for his past drunkenness only the blood</text>
  <text start="226.87" dur="5.01">of Yahshua can set him free and can</text>
  <text start="229.12" dur="4.29">cleanse him from his sins but once the</text>
  <text start="231.88" dur="6.8">blood of Yahshua has cleansed him from</text>
  <text start="233.41" dur="8.609">his sins he then needs to make the</text>
  <text start="238.68" dur="5.709">active steps to ensure that he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="242.019" dur="4.411">tempted by alcohol and that may mean for</text>
  <text start="244.389" dur="3.361">him that he has to completely and</text>
  <text start="246.43" dur="4.139">totally make sure that there was no</text>
  <text start="247.75" dur="4.44">alcohol around him that he avoids ever</text>
  <text start="250.569" dur="5.401">going into any type of place where</text>
  <text start="252.19" dur="4.98">alcohol is easily accessible he might</text>
  <text start="255.97" dur="4.56">have to</text>
  <text start="257.17" dur="5.82">call a fellow believer to keep himself</text>
  <text start="260.53" dur="4.26">accountable so that he doesn&amp;#39;t fall into</text>
  <text start="262.99" dur="5.4">that temptation in other words he needs</text>
  <text start="264.79" dur="6.06">to do whatever he he it takes to</text>
  <text start="268.39" dur="5.37">continue in that free gift of atonement</text>
  <text start="270.85" dur="6.57">that Yahshua gave him and I think this</text>
  <text start="273.76" dur="5.82">is the part of repentance or salvation</text>
  <text start="277.42" dur="4.65">that is often lost in modern-day</text>
  <text start="279.58" dur="5.46">Christianity or in the Messianic world</text>
  <text start="282.07" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s like we all understand that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.04" dur="4.2">only his blood that can take care of our</text>
  <text start="287.71" dur="3.51">sins we all know that there&amp;#39;s nothing we</text>
  <text start="289.24" dur="3.99">can do to get rid of those sins he and</text>
  <text start="291.22" dur="4.26">he alone could do it but I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.23" dur="4.68">not emphasized enough is the fact that</text>
  <text start="295.48" dur="6.12">we then after we&amp;#39;ve been set free we</text>
  <text start="297.91" dur="6.51">have an obligation to do whatever we can</text>
  <text start="301.6" dur="4.38">to continue to walk in that repentance</text>
  <text start="304.42" dur="3.39">to continue to walk in that purity of</text>
  <text start="305.98" dur="4.59">heart and I think that&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="307.81" dur="4.26">important not only in understanding the</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="4.02">blood of Yahshua and the nature of</text>
  <text start="312.07" dur="5.82">repentance but continuing in that walk</text>
  <text start="314.59" dur="5.79">on a moment by moment hour by hour day</text>
  <text start="317.89" dur="6.06">by day week by week month by month and</text>
  <text start="320.38" dur="6.41">year by year basis we know from the book</text>
  <text start="323.95" dur="5.55">of 1st John that we are to be overcomers</text>
  <text start="326.79" dur="4.45">we know for the book of Revelation when</text>
  <text start="329.5" dur="3.81">it talks about the seven congregations</text>
  <text start="331.24" dur="3.72">the gifts that are given to those who</text>
  <text start="333.31" dur="3.63">overcome in each of those seven</text>
  <text start="334.96" dur="5.76">congregations so we are to be overcomers</text>
  <text start="336.94" dur="6.93">we are to overcome and habitually walk</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="6.81">in victory habitually walk in a way that</text>
  <text start="343.87" dur="5.58">is pleasing to Yahshua and so yes we do</text>
  <text start="347.53" dur="4.38">need to rely on Yahshua each and every</text>
  <text start="349.45" dur="5.04">day his spirit is what enables us to</text>
  <text start="351.91" dur="5.25">walk in love to walk in the fruits of</text>
  <text start="354.49" dur="3.78">the spirit to deny the flesh but we also</text>
  <text start="357.16" dur="4.08">need to make sure that we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="358.27" dur="5.01">practical things to keep ourselves from</text>
  <text start="361.24" dur="5.07">temptation and from doing things that</text>
  <text start="363.28" dur="5.28">would lead us toward a place that we</text>
  <text start="366.31" dur="4.44">shouldn&amp;#39;t be so I just wanted to make</text>
  <text start="368.56" dur="3.45">this quick podcast at you know this may</text>
  <text start="370.75" dur="4.11">seem obvious to some of you out there</text>
  <text start="372.01" dur="4.44">may not be obvious to others of you out</text>
  <text start="374.86" dur="4.65">there but I just felt led to make a</text>
  <text start="376.45" dur="4.62">podcast about this even as we&amp;#39;re only a</text>
  <text start="379.51" dur="3.03">few days away from that month of</text>
  <text start="381.07" dur="3.75">repentance the month of Elul this is</text>
  <text start="382.54" dur="4.38">definitely a time to get yourself clean</text>
  <text start="384.82" dur="3.99">and right if you&amp;#39;re not if you if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="386.92" dur="2.66">backslidden or you haven&amp;#39;t been walking</text>

  <text start="410.729" dur="6.271">very very important feasts just as if</text>
  <text start="413.729" dur="6.601">not more important as Passover because</text>
  <text start="417" dur="5.159">unlike Passover and unlike Pentecost and</text>
  <text start="420.33" dur="3.959">the feasts we kept in the spring these</text>
  <text start="422.159" dur="4.531">fall feasts have not yet been fulfilled</text>
  <text start="424.289" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re still pointing toward the future</text>
