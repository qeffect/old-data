  <text start="46.53" dur="6.39">week NASA confirmed that what looked</text>
  <text start="50.34" dur="4.289">like a star exploding over China</text>
  <text start="52.92" dur="3.45">occurred it wasn&amp;#39;t a star of course it</text>
  <text start="54.629" dur="4.2">was like a some sort of meteorite or</text>
  <text start="56.37" dur="4.59">something anyway it was photographed by</text>
  <text start="58.829" dur="4.951">many people in China but it literally</text>

  <text start="87.509" dur="5.011">sometime during the eighth day which is</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="4.409">really fascinating because this asteroid</text>
  <text start="92.52" dur="4.02">is getting so close it&amp;#39;s actually gonna</text>
  <text start="94.439" dur="4.081">be between the moon and the earth but</text>
