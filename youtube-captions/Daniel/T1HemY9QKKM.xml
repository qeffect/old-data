  <text start="85.409" dur="5.67">years and years and years on my website</text>
  <text start="88.049" dur="5.881">spirit and Torah calm and whenever I</text>
  <text start="91.079" dur="4.981">talk about the paganism of Christmas of</text>
  <text start="93.93" dur="5.04">literally what&amp;#39;s called the feast of</text>
  <text start="96.06" dur="5.46">Saturnalia I always like to also point</text>
  <text start="98.97" dur="4.62">toward what we can do instead this</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="5.07">festival of lights or the feast of</text>
  <text start="103.59" dur="5.22">dedication that Jesus himself celebrated</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="4.59">he actually went up to the temple in the</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="6.33">midst of the festivities in John 10</text>
  <text start="111.18" dur="6.329">verse 22 so I&amp;#39;m gonna start off with</text>
  <text start="115.14" dur="5.1">talking about the paganism of Christmas</text>
  <text start="117.509" dur="5.61">I need to grab my Bible this is an</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="7.98">article that I actually have on my</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="7.42">website and it&amp;#39;s called the paganism of</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="5.89">Christmas and it says what is Christmas</text>
  <text start="130.539" dur="6.03">from where did it originate Yul is the</text>
  <text start="134.11" dur="5.43">child via name for infant or a little</text>
  <text start="136.569" dur="5.04">child in ancient Babylon the 25th of</text>
  <text start="139.54" dur="4.949">December was known as Yule day or the</text>
  <text start="141.609" dur="4.651">birth of the promised child day this was</text>
  <text start="144.489" dur="4.051">the day of the birth of the incarnate</text>
  <text start="146.26" dur="5.429">son who appeared as a baby child to</text>
  <text start="148.54" dur="5.039">redeem a world bound in darkness it was</text>
  <text start="151.689" dur="4.291">an essential belief of the Babylonian</text>
  <text start="153.579" dur="5.55">religious system that the Sun God and</text>
  <text start="155.98" dur="5.42">air excuse me also known as Baal was the</text>
  <text start="159.129" dur="4.44">chief God in a polytheistic system</text>

  <text start="165.819" dur="5.28">who is to be the Saviour of the world it</text>
  <text start="169.419" dur="3.481">is interesting that a review of the New</text>

  <text start="172.9" dur="5.91">early believers ever reverenced Joshua&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="180.849" dur="6.121">commemorate his death this would be in</text>
  <text start="183.129" dur="6.45">first Corinthians 11 26 we find in the</text>
  <text start="186.97" dur="6.21">Catholic Encyclopedia remember this is</text>
  <text start="189.579" dur="5.97">the Catholic Encyclopedia right that</text>
  <text start="193.18" dur="4.83">Christmas was not even among the</text>
  <text start="195.549" dur="4.68">earliest church festivals so even the</text>
  <text start="198.01" dur="3.96">Catholics are admitting this it was not</text>
  <text start="200.229" dur="3.93">until the latter part of the fourth</text>
  <text start="201.97" dur="4.949">century that the Roman Church began</text>
  <text start="204.159" dur="5.25">observing December 25th as Jesus&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="210.699" dur="4.29">Messiah to be forever observed on</text>
  <text start="212.319" dur="4.861">December the 25th at the time of this</text>
  <text start="214.989" dur="5.011">decree the Roman Church knew full well</text>
  <text start="217.18" dur="5.19">that the pagan religion cults throughout</text>
  <text start="220" dur="5.849">the Roman and Greek world celebrated the</text>
  <text start="222.37" dur="6.239">pagan Sun god Mithra on this self same</text>
  <text start="225.849" dur="5.1">day this Winter Festival was known as</text>

  <text start="230.949" dur="4.4">known in the Roman Empire as Saturnalia</text>
  <text start="233.139" dur="4.861">which is another name for Sun worship</text>
  <text start="235.349" dur="4.6">the above is a quote from a sabbatarian</text>
  <text start="238" dur="4.229">website which contains information you</text>
  <text start="239.949" dur="4.44">can find the most any major encyclopedia</text>
  <text start="242.229" dur="4.051">anywhere in the world not only does</text>
  <text start="244.389" dur="4.53">recorded history clearly show the pagan</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="3.75">roots of Christmas or satin alia but the</text>
  <text start="248.919" dur="2.611">Holy Scriptures are clear that</text>
  <text start="250.03" dur="5.359">Christians are not to learn the way of</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="6.359">the heathen so that is going into</text>
  <text start="255.389" dur="4.991">scripture in the Book of Jeremiah and</text>
  <text start="257.889" dur="5.541">it&amp;#39;s very helpful if you actually get a</text>
  <text start="260.38" dur="6.349">King James Version to read Jeremiah 10</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="5.19">because when you read it you begin to</text>
  <text start="266.729" dur="3.541">realize exactly what Yahweh is</text>
  <text start="268.62" dur="3.389">describing I&amp;#39;m just gonna start reading</text>
  <text start="270.27" dur="3.06">this it says the first six chapters of</text>
  <text start="272.009" dur="4.621">Jeremiah chapter sin</text>
  <text start="273.33" dur="6.66">10 it says carry the word which Yahweh</text>
  <text start="276.63" dur="5.819">speaks unto you o house of Israel thus</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="4.89">saith Yahweh learn not the way of the</text>
  <text start="282.449" dur="5.071">heathen and be not dismayed at the signs</text>
  <text start="284.88" dur="5.52">of heaven for the heathen are dismayed</text>
  <text start="287.52" dur="5.1">at them for the customs of the people</text>
  <text start="290.4" dur="4.5">are vain for one cuts a tree out of the</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="4.109">forest the work of the hands of the</text>
  <text start="294.9" dur="4.17">workman with the axe</text>
  <text start="296.729" dur="6.091">so they&amp;#39;ve cut this tree with an axe out</text>
  <text start="299.07" dur="7.5">of the forest then they dec the tree</text>
  <text start="302.82" dur="5.34">with silver and with gold they fasten it</text>
  <text start="306.57" dur="4.2">with nails and with hammers that have</text>
  <text start="308.16" dur="4.89">moved not their upright as the palm tree</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="4.38">but speak not they must need to be born</text>
  <text start="313.05" dur="3.78">because they cannot go be not afraid of</text>
  <text start="315.15" dur="6.06">them for they cannot do evil neither</text>
  <text start="316.83" dur="7.95">also it is is it in them to do good so</text>
  <text start="321.21" dur="5.63">this custom of cutting down a tree then</text>
  <text start="324.78" dur="4.8">decking that tree with silver and gold</text>
  <text start="326.84" dur="5.68">this is a custom that was done and</text>
  <text start="329.58" dur="6.3">eventually became the Christmas tree</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="5.429">obviously in the case of Jeremiah it was</text>
  <text start="335.88" dur="3.42">not called a Christmas tree but this is</text>
  <text start="337.949" dur="3.69">the very practice that would eventually</text>
  <text start="339.3" dur="5.76">become what we now celebrate as the</text>
  <text start="341.639" dur="6.601">Christmas tree as gross as this sounds</text>
  <text start="345.06" dur="5.43">when you&amp;#39;re hanging these balls on the</text>
  <text start="348.24" dur="5.04">tree the tree is representative of it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.49" dur="5.52">a phallus symbol basically it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="4.889">penis and the balls are the balls for</text>
  <text start="356.01" dur="3.81">the penis and that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="358.169" dur="3.331">inside your house that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.82" dur="4.29">celebrating and decorating it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="361.5" dur="4.62">quite quite disgusting but again a lot</text>
  <text start="364.11" dur="3.839">of these mystery religions a lot of the</text>
  <text start="366.12" dur="5.37">religions that came out of Babylon out</text>
  <text start="367.949" dur="6.65">of Egypt the Sun God worship religions</text>
  <text start="371.49" dur="7.02">they&amp;#39;re all wrapped up in a very</text>
  <text start="374.599" dur="6.94">perverted sexual imagery even the wreath</text>
  <text start="378.51" dur="5.399">the wreath is the vagina the tree is the</text>
  <text start="381.539" dur="5.611">penis it&amp;#39;s very very disgusting but</text>
  <text start="383.909" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s the truth and that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="387.15" dur="4.04">Bible is clear we&amp;#39;re not to have</text>
  <text start="388.169" dur="6.421">anything to do with that</text>
  <text start="391.19" dur="5.08">now some people I know will say ok</text>
  <text start="394.59" dur="3.419">Daniel yes we understand</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="3.75">that you can go to any encyclopedia you</text>
  <text start="398.009" dur="4.741">can easily discover all the paganism</text>
  <text start="400.02" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s wrapped up in what we now call</text>
  <text start="402.75" dur="5.46">Christmas but I&amp;#39;m doing it to honor</text>
  <text start="405.69" dur="5.069">Jesus I&amp;#39;m doing it to celebrate his</text>
  <text start="408.21" dur="6.359">birth okay so there&amp;#39;s a couple reasons</text>
  <text start="410.759" dur="6.84">why that that understanding really</text>
  <text start="414.569" dur="4.741">doesn&amp;#39;t hold water first of all if you</text>
  <text start="417.599" dur="4.35">go back to the book of Exodus the</text>
  <text start="419.31" dur="5.07">children of Israel when they dedicated</text>
  <text start="421.949" dur="4.5">this golden calf they dedicated it to</text>
  <text start="424.38" dur="4.11">Yahweh it actually says that in the</text>
  <text start="426.449" dur="3.96">scriptures they dedicated it to Yahweh</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="4.23">obviously Yahweh did not accept that</text>
  <text start="430.409" dur="5.581">golden calf because three thousand</text>
  <text start="432.72" dur="5.699">Israelites died because of this Yahweh</text>
  <text start="435.99" dur="4.35">does not accept paganism wrapped up in</text>
  <text start="438.419" dur="4.141">his name he didn&amp;#39;t accept it when the</text>
  <text start="440.34" dur="4.919">Israelites took a pagan idol from Egypt</text>
  <text start="442.56" dur="4.38">and dedicated unto Yahweh and he won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="445.259" dur="4.711">accept it when we take a pagan</text>
  <text start="446.94" dur="4.89">celebration rooted on it&amp;#39;s always been</text>
  <text start="449.97" dur="5.34">on December 25th this pagan Sun God</text>
  <text start="451.83" dur="5.339">celebration and dedicated to him now I</text>
  <text start="455.31" dur="4.47">actually had an interview that I did</text>
  <text start="457.169" dur="4.171">with Timothy home Seth it was this time</text>
  <text start="459.78" dur="4.74">last year actually it was actually on</text>
  <text start="461.34" dur="5.069">Christmas Day last year and he talked</text>
  <text start="464.52" dur="3.769">about all the different satanic</text>
  <text start="466.409" dur="4.651">pedophilia satanic ritual abuse</text>
  <text start="468.289" dur="4.12">sacrifices that are done from the winter</text>
  <text start="471.06" dur="3.47">solstice which actually would be today</text>
  <text start="472.409" dur="4.521">December 20 this today December 21st</text>
  <text start="474.53" dur="4.84">leading all the way up to Christmas Day</text>
  <text start="476.93" dur="4.269">and these things happen more and more</text>
  <text start="479.37" dur="5.28">and more during that time because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="481.199" dur="6.09">it&amp;#39;s a very you call sacred time for the</text>
  <text start="484.65" dur="5.359">Satanists so again this is not something</text>
  <text start="487.289" dur="7.171">that we should have anything to do with</text>
  <text start="490.009" dur="6.671">nothing whatsoever however I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="494.46" dur="3.75">to leave this in a negative light okay</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="2.97">just because we&amp;#39;re not supposed to</text>
  <text start="498.21" dur="3.209">celebrate Christmas there is a</text>
  <text start="499.65" dur="4.29">celebration that we can involve</text>
  <text start="501.419" dur="4.8">ourselves in and that is this 8 day</text>
  <text start="503.94" dur="4.92">feast of Hanukkah that actually starts</text>
  <text start="506.219" dur="4.44">tonight the story of Hanukkah is told in</text>
  <text start="508.86" dur="3.419">the first and second book of the</text>
  <text start="510.659" dur="3.18">Maccabees which you can find there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="512.279" dur="3.45">fact I think I have a link on it on my</text>
  <text start="513.839" dur="3.291">website there&amp;#39;s online resources where</text>
  <text start="515.729" dur="3.961">you can actually read it online for free</text>
  <text start="517.13" dur="5.05">but first and second Maccabees are</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="5.639">strictly historical books but they chart</text>
  <text start="522.18" dur="6.21">how this small group of Jewish Maccabees</text>
  <text start="525.329" dur="4.241">against impossible odds they dedicate</text>
  <text start="528.39" dur="3.34">themselves to yah they say</text>
  <text start="529.57" dur="4.8">will uphold your Torah just please help</text>
  <text start="531.73" dur="5.43">us to free our nation and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="534.37" dur="4.65">what they do they wage a war that lasts</text>
  <text start="537.16" dur="4.44">about three and a half years and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="539.02" dur="5.94">able to drive back the largest empire in</text>
  <text start="541.6" dur="5.25">history and they&amp;#39;re able to free</text>
  <text start="544.96" dur="3.9">Jerusalem free the nation of Israel</text>
  <text start="546.85" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re able to go in and cleanse the</text>
  <text start="548.86" dur="3.69">temple it takes eight days to cleanse</text>
  <text start="550.81" dur="4.11">the temple from all the wicked things</text>
  <text start="552.55" dur="4.23">that the pagan Greeks had done you know</text>
  <text start="554.92" dur="4.53">they sacrificed a pig on the altar and</text>
  <text start="556.78" dur="4.26">they just totally trash the place and so</text>
  <text start="559.45" dur="2.94">I took them eight days to cleanse that</text>
  <text start="561.04" dur="5.28">temple and that&amp;#39;s exactly why we</text>
  <text start="562.39" dur="5.13">celebrate this for eight days so this is</text>
  <text start="566.32" dur="5.76">a time when we&amp;#39;re supposed to rededicate</text>
  <text start="567.52" dur="6.27">ourselves to yot again if you&amp;#39;re new to</text>
  <text start="572.08" dur="5.16">my channel the reason I say yah you can</text>
  <text start="573.79" dur="5.9">find that in Psalm 68 for in any Bible</text>
  <text start="577.24" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s where we get the word hallelujah</text>
  <text start="579.69" dur="5.11">that&amp;#39;s why we that&amp;#39;s the one word that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="582.67" dur="4.2">actually anywhere you are in the world</text>
  <text start="584.8" dur="4.2">later in China or Russia or wherever you</text>
  <text start="586.87" dur="3.81">are you could say the word hallelujah</text>
  <text start="589" dur="3.6">and people know exactly what you mean</text>

  <text start="597.18" dur="5.92">you know we can celebrate this feast of</text>
  <text start="600.55" dur="4.98">Hanukkah this eight-day dedicate days of</text>
  <text start="603.1" dur="7.68">dedication by rededicating ourselves to</text>
  <text start="605.53" dur="7.2">him just like just like the Jews once</text>
  <text start="610.78" dur="4.62">they drove back the greets rededicated</text>
  <text start="612.73" dur="4.95">the temple to yah and cleansed it</text>
  <text start="615.4" dur="12.33">cleansed it out now I want to reign in</text>
  <text start="617.68" dur="13.95">the Christian New Testament in John I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="627.73" dur="6.17">talking about the Gospel of John chapter</text>
  <text start="631.63" dur="2.27">10</text>
  <text start="636.23" dur="8.05">verse 22 it says and it was at Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="641.73" dur="4.47">the Feast of the dedication which is</text>
  <text start="644.28" dur="5.79">another name for feast of Hanukkah and</text>
  <text start="646.2" dur="6.12">it was winter and Jesus Yahshua walked</text>
  <text start="650.07" dur="4.44">in the temple in Solomon&amp;#39;s porch and</text>
  <text start="652.32" dur="3.69">then came the Jews round about him and</text>
  <text start="654.51" dur="3.54">said unto Him how long does thou makest</text>
  <text start="656.01" dur="4.86">a doubt if thou be the messiah tell us</text>
  <text start="658.05" dur="4.68">plainly and then Yasha begins to contend</text>
  <text start="660.87" dur="3.63">with the Pharisees and the Sadducees and</text>
  <text start="662.73" dur="3.81">he be introduced of teaching right there</text>
  <text start="664.5" dur="4.35">in Solomon&amp;#39;s porch to me it is very</text>
  <text start="666.54" dur="4.2">evident that Jesus obviously was</text>
  <text start="668.85" dur="3.9">involved in these festivities in</text>
  <text start="670.74" dur="4.02">celebrating the feast of dedication or</text>
  <text start="672.75" dur="4.8">Hanukkah because if he wasn&amp;#39;t he would</text>
  <text start="674.76" dur="4.11">have he wouldn&amp;#39;t even go into Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="677.55" dur="2.7">but he did he went right to Solomon&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="678.87" dur="3.81">porch with a bit which would have been</text>
  <text start="680.25" dur="4.35">the nerve center for celebrating this</text>
  <text start="682.68" dur="4.53">feast of dedication this feast of</text>
  <text start="684.6" dur="5.88">Hanukkah and so that&amp;#39;s exactly where</text>
  <text start="687.21" dur="7.14">Jesus went to teach and to preach and to</text>
  <text start="690.48" dur="7.53">join in with the festivities one thing</text>
  <text start="694.35" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s interesting about this is during</text>
  <text start="698.01" dur="5.34">this feast of Hanukkah I want to read</text>
  <text start="699.78" dur="6.69">exactly what Jesus is teaching he says I</text>
  <text start="703.35" dur="4.86">told you and you believe not the works</text>
  <text start="706.47" dur="4.2">that I do in my father&amp;#39;s name they bear</text>
  <text start="708.21" dur="4.35">witness of me but you believe not</text>
  <text start="710.67" dur="4.23">because you&amp;#39;re not of my sheep as I said</text>
  <text start="712.56" dur="4.5">unto you my sheep hear my voice and I</text>
  <text start="714.9" dur="3.72">know them and they follow me and I give</text>
  <text start="717.06" dur="3.63">unto them eternal life and they shall</text>
  <text start="718.62" dur="5.55">never perish neither shall any man pluck</text>
  <text start="720.69" dur="4.98">them out of my hand my father which gave</text>
  <text start="724.17" dur="3.09">them to me is greater than all and no</text>
  <text start="725.67" dur="4.79">man is able to pluck them out of my</text>
  <text start="727.26" dur="6.06">father&amp;#39;s hand I and my father are one</text>
  <text start="730.46" dur="5.44">then the Jews took up stones to stone</text>
  <text start="733.32" dur="4.23">him and jesus answered them sending</text>
  <text start="735.9" dur="3.84">saying many good works that I showed you</text>
  <text start="737.55" dur="4.62">from My Father for which of these works</text>
  <text start="739.74" dur="4.14">do you stone me and the Jews answered</text>
  <text start="742.17" dur="4.26">him saying for a good work we stone thee</text>
  <text start="743.88" dur="6.9">not but for blasphemy and because thou</text>
  <text start="746.43" dur="5.79">being a man makest a giza so answered</text>
  <text start="750.78" dur="3.21">them and said is it not written in your</text>
  <text start="752.22" dur="4.08">law I said you are gods</text>
  <text start="753.99" dur="4.14">if he called them gods unto whom the</text>
  <text start="756.3" dur="4.41">word became and the scripture cannot be</text>
  <text start="758.13" dur="3.94">broken say of him whom the father has</text>
  <text start="760.71" dur="3.64">sanctified and sent to</text>
  <text start="762.07" dur="4.89">the world bout last Simas because I said</text>
  <text start="764.35" dur="4.59">I had the Sun of yah if I do not the</text>
  <text start="766.96" dur="3.9">works of my father believe me not but if</text>
  <text start="768.94" dur="4.17">I do though you believe not me believe</text>
  <text start="770.86" dur="5.1">the works that you may know and believe</text>
  <text start="773.11" dur="5.58">that the father is in me and I in him</text>
  <text start="775.96" dur="6.09">therefore they saw again to take him but</text>
  <text start="778.69" dur="5.61">he escaped out of their hand so right</text>
  <text start="782.05" dur="4.47">there in the midst of the festival of</text>
  <text start="784.3" dur="2.61">lights the feast of dedication feast of</text>
  <text start="786.52" dur="3.96">Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="786.91" dur="5.58">Jesus is declaring that he is God He is</text>
  <text start="790.48" dur="3.6">God in the flesh and of course the</text>
  <text start="792.49" dur="3.93">Pharisees and Sadducees who don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="794.08" dur="3.6">to accept that they want to murder him</text>
  <text start="796.42" dur="4.52">and kill him and they&amp;#39;re not able to do</text>
  <text start="797.68" dur="6.48">so because it&amp;#39;s not his time yet so I</text>
  <text start="800.94" dur="4.9">think it&amp;#39;s very interesting that as we</text>
  <text start="804.16" dur="3.93">are celebrating the feast of Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="805.84" dur="4.83">this festival of lights of rededicating</text>
  <text start="808.09" dur="4.98">ourselves to him remembering those words</text>
  <text start="810.67" dur="4.89">when you know they pressed Jesus this</text>
  <text start="813.07" dur="3.72">was another example this didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="815.56" dur="3.87">during the feast of Hanukkah but they</text>
  <text start="816.79" dur="4.11">pressed him and they said you know are</text>
  <text start="819.43" dur="3.96">you saying that you&amp;#39;re greater than our</text>
  <text start="820.9" dur="6.18">father Abraham and he said from his own</text>
  <text start="823.39" dur="6.75">lips he said before Abraham was I am</text>
  <text start="827.08" dur="5.97">that&amp;#39;s what Jesus said he plainly</text>
  <text start="830.14" dur="5.91">declared that he was Yahweh manifest in</text>
  <text start="833.05" dur="6.21">the flesh he was God walking on the</text>
  <text start="836.05" dur="4.77">earth and that is the message that he</text>
  <text start="839.26" dur="3.87">clearly tells the Pharisees and</text>
  <text start="840.82" dur="8.13">Sadducees during this festival of</text>
  <text start="843.13" dur="8.25">Hanukkah hallelujah so I know that in</text>
  <text start="848.95" dur="4.41">modern-day Judaism there have been a lot</text>
  <text start="851.38" dur="3.75">of sort of paganism that has gotten into</text>
  <text start="853.36" dur="4.29">Chanukah you know they used the dreidel</text>
  <text start="855.13" dur="4.17">and all this stuff and I reject all of</text>
  <text start="857.65" dur="3.87">that that kind of stuff I don&amp;#39;t get into</text>
  <text start="859.3" dur="5.03">this I think that the importance of what</text>
  <text start="861.52" dur="4.98">Hanukkah is all about it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="864.33" dur="6.64">rededicating ourselves to him it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="866.5" dur="7.74">spending extra time with him beautiful</text>
  <text start="870.97" dur="5.37">Chanukah is spending every night as you</text>
  <text start="874.24" dur="4.98">like those the Hanukkah the candles</text>
  <text start="876.34" dur="4.26">lighting it up and praising out just</text>
  <text start="879.22" dur="2.429">spending extra time worshipping and</text>
  <text start="880.6" dur="2.76">praising him</text>
  <text start="881.649" dur="3.81">with others and praising and worshipping</text>
  <text start="883.36" dur="4.86">him that&amp;#39;s one of the best ways I think</text>
  <text start="885.459" dur="7.92">to celebrate Hanukkah I&amp;#39;ll show my</text>
  <text start="888.22" dur="9.929">conocchia remember the menorah is the</text>
  <text start="893.379" dur="8.99">menorah is seven seven candles and the</text>
  <text start="898.149" dur="7.141">ha Nakia here is nine it&amp;#39;s nine and</text>
  <text start="902.369" dur="6.7">what&amp;#39;s interesting is if you go to the</text>
  <text start="905.29" dur="5.729">book of Zechariah it talks about the two</text>
  <text start="909.069" dur="5.25">olive trees on either side that also</text>
  <text start="911.019" dur="5.88">represent the two witnesses in which the</text>
  <text start="914.319" dur="4.14">pipe of goal of the Holy Spirit will</text>
  <text start="916.899" dur="3.93">flow through them and the two witnesses</text>
  <text start="918.459" dur="4.021">are prophesied to eventually hit the</text>
  <text start="920.829" dur="3.48">scene during the three and a half years</text>
  <text start="922.48" dur="4.109">of the Great Tribulation but you have</text>
  <text start="924.309" dur="5.25">these two olive trees and they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="926.589" dur="4.771">either side of the menorah you have the</text>
  <text start="929.559" dur="3.63">menorah right there right there&amp;#39;s seven</text>
  <text start="931.36" dur="4.409">and then you got these two olive trees</text>
  <text start="933.189" dur="5.781">on either side so that makes the ha</text>
  <text start="935.769" dur="6">Nakia and that&amp;#39;s what we light up for</text>
  <text start="938.97" dur="4.539">the eight days of Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="941.769" dur="3.99">you have the serving candle in the</text>
  <text start="943.509" dur="3.721">middle that you&amp;#39;ll light and then on day</text>
  <text start="945.759" dur="3.51">one which starts tonight you light the</text>
  <text start="947.23" dur="3.449">first one and then on day two you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="949.269" dur="3.63">like the second one in day three and it</text>
  <text start="950.679" dur="5.731">goes on and on until all eight days have</text>
  <text start="952.899" dur="6.5">been lit up so that&amp;#39;s how you light up</text>
  <text start="956.41" dur="5.969">your Hanna Kia for the festival of of</text>
  <text start="959.399" dur="3.971">Hanukkah there&amp;#39;s been some years where</text>
  <text start="962.379" dur="1.26">I&amp;#39;ve just decided to light up the whole</text>
  <text start="963.37" dur="2.25">thing</text>
  <text start="963.639" dur="5.221">every night I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any</text>
  <text start="965.62" dur="4.68">rhyme or reason or specific commandment</text>
  <text start="968.86" dur="2.61">that you have to do it but just the</text>
  <text start="970.3" dur="2.879">traditional ways you light up the</text>
  <text start="971.47" dur="3.719">servant candle first and then day one</text>
  <text start="973.179" dur="5.97">day two day three and so far through all</text>
  <text start="975.189" dur="7.38">eight days eight of course is the number</text>
  <text start="979.149" dur="5.761">of new beginning we read about that all</text>
  <text start="982.569" dur="4.051">through scripture and Hanukkah which</text>
  <text start="984.91" dur="3.869">happens pretty much about two months</text>
  <text start="986.62" dur="4.17">after the feast of Sukkot it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="988.779" dur="5.16">like an echo of Sukkot it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="990.79" dur="6.479">joyous time it&amp;#39;s a very festive festive</text>
  <text start="993.939" dur="6.59">time of course this was the greatest</text>
  <text start="997.269" dur="6.6">victory that the Israel that Israel</text>
  <text start="1000.529" dur="7.211">achieved just before the time of Christ</text>
  <text start="1003.869" dur="5.491">has happened about 150 years before the</text>
  <text start="1007.74" dur="3.659">time of Messiah before</text>
  <text start="1009.36" dur="5.31">was born and this was a huge victory</text>
  <text start="1011.399" dur="5.461">because if you think about well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1014.67" dur="5.43">very similar to for example the American</text>
  <text start="1016.86" dur="4.95">Revolution that just a small band of</text>
  <text start="1020.1" dur="3.359">rebels we&amp;#39;re able to overcome the</text>
  <text start="1021.81" dur="3.93">greatest empire in history which was the</text>
  <text start="1023.459" dur="6.301">British Empire that&amp;#39;s exactly what the</text>
  <text start="1025.74" dur="7.14">Maccabees did during this the Maccabee</text>
  <text start="1029.76" dur="5.189">and Wars when they push back this huge</text>
  <text start="1032.88" dur="5.189">giant Empire known as the Greek Empire</text>
  <text start="1034.949" dur="4.561">so in any case I hope this gives you at</text>
  <text start="1038.069" dur="4.681">least some food for thought to pray</text>
  <text start="1039.51" dur="6.39">about to see cure really pressing in and</text>
  <text start="1042.75" dur="5.01">doing what Jesus did he was the one who</text>
  <text start="1045.9" dur="3.12">was involved in Hanukah he was the one</text>
  <text start="1047.76" dur="2.789">who was involved in feast a festive</text>
  <text start="1049.02" dur="3.029">feast of dedication we&amp;#39;re gonna call</text>
  <text start="1050.549" dur="3.961">ourselves Christians and disciples of</text>
  <text start="1052.049" dur="4.591">Christ we ought to do what Jesus did and</text>

  <text start="1063.559" dur="7.031">very much in opposite to these satanic</text>
  <text start="1067.38" dur="6.24">holidays like Christmas like Halloween</text>
  <text start="1070.59" dur="4.86">like Easter which are really they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1075.45" dur="3.87">this is very easy to see the Satanists</text>
  <text start="1077.429" dur="3.271">are very active on those days and they</text>
  <text start="1079.32" dur="4.32">celebrate those days and we should have</text>
