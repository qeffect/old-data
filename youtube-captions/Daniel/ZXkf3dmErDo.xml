  <text start="28.38" dur="7.41">whenever I read Isaiah that verse kind</text>
  <text start="32.399" dur="5.371">of is the capstone for that book because</text>
  <text start="35.79" dur="4.44">it just encapsulates all the different</text>
  <text start="37.77" dur="3.99">aspects of who yah is of who the</text>
  <text start="40.23" dur="3.18">Messiah&amp;#39;s he is the Prince of Peace the</text>
  <text start="41.76" dur="3.479">everlasting father he&amp;#39;s the mighty on</text>

  <text start="45.239" dur="4.41">teaches us all truth he is all of these</text>
  <text start="47.34" dur="10.71">things and Isaiah really highlights that</text>
  <text start="49.649" dur="15.271">for us in Jeremiah he&amp;#39;s the weeping</text>
  <text start="58.05" dur="10.319">prophet what do I mean by that well in</text>
  <text start="64.92" dur="6.15">psalm 119 we read David writes out he</text>
  <text start="68.369" dur="6.091">says rivers of waters run down mine eyes</text>
  <text start="71.07" dur="5.1">for they made voyageur torta so that was</text>
  <text start="74.46" dur="2.909">the heart David expressed in psalm 119</text>
  <text start="76.17" dur="2.339">and that&amp;#39;s the heart of the Jeremiah</text>
  <text start="77.369" dur="3.211">expressed it all through that book</text>
  <text start="78.509" dur="3.511">because he&amp;#39;s weeping over Israel because</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;ve turned away from the tour they</text>
  <text start="82.02" dur="3.419">turned away from his Commandments and</text>
  <text start="83.31" dur="5.989">they&amp;#39;re just so he&amp;#39;s so sad they&amp;#39;ve made</text>
  <text start="85.439" dur="8.461">void his for it and I think this really</text>
  <text start="89.299" dur="7.03">expresses a side of Yahshua of this of</text>
  <text start="93.9" dur="4.41">who he is a pooja is because he does</text>
  <text start="96.329" dur="4.47">weep over our sin he does weep over when</text>
  <text start="98.31" dur="3.78">his people or not keeping his ways in</text>
  <text start="100.799" dur="4.801">his commands because he knows that that</text>
  <text start="102.09" dur="5.04">just brings cursing upon his people so</text>
  <text start="105.6" dur="4.199">he is a weeping prophet and he is</text>
  <text start="107.13" dur="3.9">affected by what we do you know people</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="3.451">try to make him out like he&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="3.25">distant deity it doesn&amp;#39;t affect it but</text>
  <text start="113.25" dur="8.85">he is he&amp;#39;s affected</text>
  <text start="114.28" dur="12.5">our choices and then kind of the same</text>
  <text start="122.1" dur="4.68">theme is carried over into lamentations</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="7.33">he is the mourner mourner over</text>
  <text start="131.11" dur="4.83">wickedness now it says in another part</text>
  <text start="134.29" dur="3.72">of scripture that he doesn&amp;#39;t desire any</text>
  <text start="135.94" dur="4.049">of the wicked to parish he wants all to</text>
  <text start="138.01" dur="3.87">come to repentance in the dome but he</text>
  <text start="139.989" dur="12.78">does morning he doesn&amp;#39;t want over evil</text>
  <text start="141.88" dur="12.9">and Ezekiel he is the son of man so all</text>
  <text start="152.769" dur="3.541">four Ezekiel&amp;#39;s equals refer to as the</text>
  <text start="154.78" dur="3.78">son of man its kind of first time we</text>
  <text start="156.31" dur="5.85">really see this phrase used over and</text>
  <text start="158.56" dur="5.94">over again the son of man who sets his</text>
  <text start="162.16" dur="4.049">face against those who will not hear</text>
  <text start="164.5" dur="3.87">millat listen testifying against the</text>
  <text start="166.209" dur="4.471">apostate so you remember Ezekiel is</text>
  <text start="168.37" dur="5.339">actually sent not to a foreign people</text>
  <text start="170.68" dur="6.96">like saying Jonah was but as Eagle sent</text>
  <text start="173.709" dur="5.671">to the house of Israel and yah even</text>
  <text start="177.64" dur="3.09">tells them so I know they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="179.38" dur="2.669">to listen to you I know they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="180.73" dur="3.479">harden our hearts I know they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="182.049" dur="3.541">to refuse you I know that I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="184.209" dur="2.971">to be history but I still want you to go</text>
  <text start="185.59" dur="4.11">to them because I want you to be a</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="4.86">testimony against one so as evil as sent</text>
  <text start="189.7" dur="4.62">Israel to testify against them for their</text>
  <text start="192.04" dur="4.169">apostasy and this is something that the</text>
  <text start="194.32" dur="3.78">side doesn&amp;#39;t well he testifies against</text>
  <text start="196.209" dur="3.361">the apostate as a witness against mine</text>
  <text start="198.1" dur="5.82">even though he knows we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="199.57" dur="6.449">repent so that brings up an interesting</text>
  <text start="203.92" dur="3.539">things some people say well don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="206.019" dur="3.69">go to these people it&amp;#39;s just throwing a</text>
  <text start="207.459" dur="3.84">pearl before swine and that is true to</text>
  <text start="209.709" dur="3.361">some extent but there there is</text>
  <text start="211.299" dur="3.961">scriptural precedent where sometimes you</text>
  <text start="213.07" dur="4.169">can be sent somewhere where they will</text>
  <text start="215.26" dur="5.33">not listen but yah still wants you to go</text>
  <text start="217.239" dur="3.351">as a testimony</text>
  <text start="236.98" dur="12.31">in Daniel he&amp;#39;s the fourth man in the</text>
  <text start="243.59" dur="9">furnace hmm yeah they weren&amp;#39;t expecting</text>
  <text start="249.29" dur="7.56">that really know and more importantly</text>
  <text start="252.59" dur="6.209">has our deliverer so Shadrach Meshach</text>
  <text start="256.85" dur="3.3">and Abednego or four stone into the</text>
  <text start="258.799" dur="3.421">fiery furnace because they won&amp;#39;t bow</text>
  <text start="260.15" dur="3.84">down the statue of Nebuchadnezzar and</text>
  <text start="262.22" dur="3.75">then Nebuchadnezzar sees that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="263.99" dur="5.31">fourth man walking in the midst of them</text>
  <text start="265.97" dur="5.85">they come out their clothes billion of</text>
  <text start="269.3" dur="15.12">smell like smoke and that&amp;#39;s because that</text>
  <text start="271.82" dur="18.29">fourth man was Yasha in Hosea Hosea he</text>
  <text start="284.42" dur="7.65">is the faithful he&amp;#39;s a faithful husband</text>
  <text start="290.11" dur="3.94">faithful husband in the face of</text>
  <text start="292.07" dur="5.04">unfaithfulness suit from Rosetta he was</text>
  <text start="294.05" dur="4.74">commanded to marry a prostitute okay and</text>
  <text start="297.11" dur="3.26">not only a prostitute but prostitutes</text>
  <text start="298.79" dur="5.31">and continue to go back for prostitution</text>
  <text start="300.37" dur="6.31">after he took her to be his wife what</text>
  <text start="304.1" dur="5.31">did God command Hosea to do to go out</text>
  <text start="306.68" dur="5.13">and get her so we read about Hosea we</text>
  <text start="309.41" dur="4.05">continue to out and get his wife and</text>
  <text start="311.81" dur="3.72">bring her back even after she was</text>
  <text start="313.46" dur="3.9">playing the war so Hosea really</text>
  <text start="315.53" dur="3.89">highlights how God is a faithful husband</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="4.64">me you know he doesn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="319.42" dur="10.37">even when we&amp;#39;re playing the part of a</text>
  <text start="322" dur="11.31">spiritual prostitute in the book of Joel</text>
  <text start="329.79" dur="11.05">he is the one who pours out his spirit</text>
  <text start="333.31" dur="9.6">on all flesh and of course we know that</text>
  <text start="340.84" dur="4.8">this prophecy is fulfilled in the book</text>
  <text start="342.91" dur="4.74">of Acts and easily filled with this day</text>
  <text start="345.64" dur="3.36">but this is where that was first</text>
  <text start="347.65" dur="6.03">made how he&amp;#39;s going to borrow a spirit</text>
  <text start="349" dur="6.92">on all flesh sons and daughters hold</text>
  <text start="353.68" dur="2.24">them</text>
  <text start="362.53" dur="11.86">in The Book of Amos he is the one who</text>
