  <text start="122.34" dur="4.139">tribes of Israel when I went over to the</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="4.98">wheat on my right the the tree house on</text>
  <text start="126.479" dur="5.601">my right there&amp;#39;s two chairs sitting out</text>
  <text start="129.239" dur="4.671">in front of the of the of the</text>
  <text start="132.08" dur="3.84">the place and there&amp;#39;s also two levels</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="3.9">that one happens to be to two levels or</text>
  <text start="135.92" dur="3.47">like bunk beds on the SEC level show me</text>
  <text start="137.81" dur="3.81">the two witnesses are part of the wheat</text>
  <text start="139.39" dur="4.15">so the two witnesses are part of the</text>
  <text start="141.62" dur="4.17">week group the two witnesses may not</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="3.87">even be saved yet they may be part of</text>
  <text start="145.79" dur="2.76">the scornful bride you know the people</text>
  <text start="147.41" dur="4.35">that are just sort of not really</text>
  <text start="148.55" dur="5.97">pressing in but then but then just in</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="4.74">the days prior to when we get taken to</text>
  <text start="154.52" dur="3.45">the same place they may repent and turn</text>
  <text start="156.5" dur="2.82">to you and they become the two witnesses</text>
  <text start="157.97" dur="3.36">and they that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re martyrs</text>
  <text start="159.32" dur="3.33">because they&amp;#39;re part of the wheat now I</text>
  <text start="161.33" dur="2.97">could be wrong on that that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="162.65" dur="3.87">speculation the two witnesses could very</text>
  <text start="164.3" dur="3.54">well be right now walking in the</text>
  <text start="166.52" dur="2.76">fullness of the tour in the spirit with</text>
  <text start="167.84" dur="2.82">a pure heart and they&amp;#39;re just called to</text>
  <text start="169.28" dur="2.55">be martyrs just like Yahshua even though</text>
  <text start="170.66" dur="2.64">he was barley he still had to be a</text>
  <text start="171.83" dur="3.21">martyr because he had to fulfill a</text>
  <text start="173.3" dur="3.57">certain quest so I could be wrong about</text>
  <text start="175.04" dur="3.69">that I&amp;#39;m not saying that&amp;#39;s a yeah but</text>
  <text start="176.87" dur="3.36">what I am saying is it so neat that Yas</text>

  <text start="182.51" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s just really neat and again it shows</text>
  <text start="184.64" dur="2.58">the picture of the difference between</text>
  <text start="186.02" dur="3.66">the wheat the barley and the tears and</text>
  <text start="187.22" dur="4.59">how it ties in to you know the barley</text>
  <text start="189.68" dur="5.24">goes to the safe place and they&amp;#39;re the</text>
