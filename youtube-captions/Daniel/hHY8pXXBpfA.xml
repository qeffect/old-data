  <text start="7.08" dur="5.03">out there at the ocean so I was thinking</text>
  <text start="10.86" dur="3.12">my audio is probably gonna be pretty</text>
  <text start="12.11" dur="2.979">distorted if I go out there and try to</text>
  <text start="13.98" dur="2.129">do the teaching so I&amp;#39;m gonna be my</text>
  <text start="15.089" dur="3.36">teaching here in the car</text>
  <text start="16.109" dur="6">and then we&amp;#39;re gonna walk along the</text>
  <text start="18.449" dur="5.041">ocean after this I wanted to point out</text>
  <text start="22.109" dur="5.941">just something very simple and this is</text>
  <text start="23.49" dur="9.21">in numbers chapter 27 starting in verse</text>
  <text start="28.05" dur="8.7">18 says in Yahweh said unto Moses take</text>
  <text start="32.7" dur="7.67">the Joshua the son of nun a man in whom</text>
  <text start="36.75" dur="6.21">is the spirit and lay your hand upon him</text>
  <text start="40.37" dur="6.06">and of course this is when most Moshe is</text>
  <text start="42.96" dur="5.88">he&amp;#39;s about to die and he&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="46.43" dur="3.76">directed by yata commissioned Joshua to</text>
  <text start="48.84" dur="4.02">lead the children of Israel into the</text>
  <text start="50.19" dur="4.68">Promised Land after they&amp;#39;ve wandered in</text>
  <text start="52.86" dur="4.14">the wilderness for forty years but what</text>
  <text start="54.87" dur="3.509">I wanted to point out was you know we</text>
  <text start="57" dur="2.85">think that the Holy Spirit filling</text>
  <text start="58.379" dur="3.031">people with some sort of new thing that</text>
  <text start="59.85" dur="4.949">happened on Pentecost in the New</text>
  <text start="61.41" dur="6.029">Testament it&amp;#39;s not true right here it</text>
  <text start="64.799" dur="5.881">says Yahweh senator Moshe take thee</text>
  <text start="67.439" dur="5.641">Joshua the son of nun a man in whom is</text>
  <text start="70.68" dur="3.63">the spirit and lay your hand upon him so</text>
  <text start="73.08" dur="3.63">there&amp;#39;s the laying on of hands</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="3.78">Joshua&amp;#39;s filled with the Holy Spirit all</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="3.54">of these things that you read about</text>
  <text start="78.09" dur="6.45">rabbi shai will Apostle Paul talking</text>
  <text start="80.25" dur="6.78">about in the renewed covenant is here in</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="4.11">the Torah in fact I want to make</text>
  <text start="87.03" dur="4.47">something very clear there&amp;#39;s only two</text>
  <text start="88.65" dur="6.66">things that are completely new in the</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="5.909">renewed covenant number one is that what</text>
  <text start="95.31" dur="2.64">was new is that Yahshua for the first</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="4.261">time</text>
  <text start="97.95" dur="5.43">yaahh God he became a man walked this</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="3.36">earth and he showed us how to love how</text>
  <text start="103.38" dur="2.55">to obey Torah that was that was</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="4.68">something that was brand-new never</text>
  <text start="105.93" dur="6.84">happened before and two he spilled his</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="4.199">blood that and it was you know his blood</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="2.34">is the only thing that&amp;#39;s sufficient to</text>
  <text start="113.909" dur="2.731">wipe away our sins the blood of the</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="3.96">bulls and goats was only pointing toward</text>
  <text start="116.64" dur="5.22">that those are the only two things that</text>
  <text start="119.07" dur="5.67">were new everything else is built upon</text>
  <text start="121.86" dur="5.39">the Torah so you see the Holy Spirit in</text>
  <text start="124.74" dur="4.95">Joshua you see the laying on of hands</text>
  <text start="127.25" dur="5.23">that stuff is not new that stuff was in</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="4.14">the Torah you saw when Yahshua taught in</text>
  <text start="132.48" dur="4.47">Matthew five when he said</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="5.88">I come not to abolish the Torah rather I</text>
  <text start="136.95" dur="5.43">come to revive it I come to show you how</text>
  <text start="139.71" dur="4.83">to keep it people say no Daniel he came</text>
  <text start="142.38" dur="3.6">to fulfill it so we don&amp;#39;t have to do it</text>
  <text start="144.54" dur="3.93">anymore well that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="145.98" dur="5.13">because his very next statement in</text>
  <text start="148.47" dur="4.53">Matthew 5:17 through 20 is as long as</text>
  <text start="151.11" dur="3.99">you see the heavens above you and the</text>
  <text start="153" dur="5.19">earth below you not one jot or tittle</text>
  <text start="155.1" dur="5.46">from this Torah will pass away so either</text>
  <text start="158.19" dur="4.86">Jesus was a liar or he was telling the</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="5.25">truth I believe Jesus was telling the</text>
  <text start="163.05" dur="4.53">truth not one jot or tittle of the Torah</text>
  <text start="165.81" dur="3.36">will ever pass away until the heavens</text>
  <text start="167.58" dur="4.41">and earth pass away and the heavens and</text>
  <text start="169.17" dur="6.81">earth do not pass away until after the</text>
  <text start="171.99" dur="8.25">1000 year reign of Messiah that&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="175.98" dur="6.6">way way in the future so every jot and</text>
  <text start="180.24" dur="3.96">tittle of torez is is still in effect</text>
  <text start="182.58" dur="3.24">now people say well what about all the</text>
  <text start="184.2" dur="3.69">animal sacrifices what about the</text>
  <text start="185.82" dur="4.44">Levitical priesthood all that stuff that</text>
  <text start="187.89" dur="4.32">stuff will not be restored again it</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="4.23">hasn&amp;#39;t passed away but it won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="192.21" dur="4.38">restored again until after we get</text>
  <text start="194.49" dur="4.92">resurrected we meet Jesus and the clouds</text>
  <text start="196.59" dur="4.41">and we return with him and we rule and</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="3.54">reign over the survivors of the Great</text>
  <text start="201" dur="4.2">Tribulation and then yes there will be a</text>
  <text start="202.95" dur="3.93">Millennial temple there will be animal</text>
  <text start="205.2" dur="5.1">sacrifices that will be pointing back</text>
  <text start="206.88" dur="5.25">toward the cross there will be animal</text>
  <text start="210.3" dur="3.3">sacrifices I know some of you think well</text>
  <text start="212.13" dur="2.43">how can that be if Christ is ruling and</text>
  <text start="213.6" dur="2.31">reigning was it he the ultimate</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="4.07">sacrifice he was the penultimate</text>
  <text start="215.91" dur="4.95">sacrifice yes absolutely</text>
  <text start="218.63" dur="3.37">but these animal sacrifices will be</text>
  <text start="220.86" dur="2.67">pointing back in if you don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="222" dur="2.37">that there&amp;#39;s gonna be animal sacrifice</text>
  <text start="223.53" dur="3.45">in the Millennial Kingdom</text>
  <text start="224.37" dur="4.38">you need to read Malachi chapter 3 you</text>
  <text start="226.98" dur="2.49">need to read the last four chapters of</text>
  <text start="228.75" dur="3.18">Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="229.47" dur="4.17">you need to read Zechariah 14</text>
  <text start="231.93" dur="4.47">particularly the last few verses of</text>
  <text start="233.64" dur="4.44">Zechariah 14 it&amp;#39;s very clear that there</text>
  <text start="236.4" dur="3.75">will be animal sacrifices no they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="238.08" dur="5.82">replace the atonement they simply point</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="5.1">and back toward what the Messiah did but</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="4.559">those are not gonna be into Lamoni Oh</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="4.95">King demur right now before we get</text>
  <text start="248.459" dur="5.161">resurrected weird have the heart where</text>
  <text start="250.2" dur="4.86">we do out all we can in the Torah like</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="4.11">following the clean food laws in</text>
  <text start="255.06" dur="5.82">Leviticus 11 like keeping the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="257.73" dur="4.53">day like doing the best we can to keep</text>
  <text start="260.88" dur="4.71">these feast days these these are things</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="4.79">that Jesus did on earth oh we should be</text>
  <text start="265.59" dur="4.419">doing them as well</text>
  <text start="267.05" dur="6">and in fact that&amp;#39;s what Hebrews 8 says</text>
  <text start="270.009" dur="19">Hebrews 8 says very clearly he said it</text>
  <text start="273.05" dur="20.76">says in fact I just read Hebrews 8 this</text>
  <text start="289.009" dur="6.601">is quoted from Jeremiah 31:31 it says</text>
  <text start="293.81" dur="3.539">for if that first covenant had been</text>
  <text start="295.61" dur="3.63">faultless then should no place had been</text>
  <text start="297.349" dur="4.981">fought for the second sought for the</text>
  <text start="299.24" dur="4.44">second now what kind of fault do you</text>
  <text start="302.33" dur="3.209">find in the first covenant do you find</text>
  <text start="303.68" dur="4.859">fault with the Torah well in verse 8 it</text>
  <text start="305.539" dur="4.291">says for finding fault with them you see</text>
  <text start="308.539" dur="4.051">he found fault with the children of</text>
  <text start="309.83" dur="4.649">Israel why because unlike Joshua the son</text>
  <text start="312.59" dur="3.27">of nun they did not have the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="314.479" dur="4.141">in them they weren&amp;#39;t mixing their faith</text>
  <text start="315.86" dur="4.619">with the truth that&amp;#39;s why they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="318.62" dur="3.57">make it in the promised land that first</text>
  <text start="320.479" dur="3.601">generation all died in wilderness and</text>
  <text start="322.19" dur="4.529">only Joshua and Caleb along with that</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="4.559">second generation went in to take the</text>
  <text start="326.719" dur="3.6">promised land so he says for finding</text>
  <text start="328.639" dur="4.051">fault with them he said behold the days</text>
  <text start="330.319" dur="4.261">come saith Yahweh when I will make a new</text>
  <text start="332.69" dur="3.659">covenant with the house of Israel and</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="3.269">with the house of Judah notice he</text>
  <text start="336.349" dur="3.75">doesn&amp;#39;t make a covenant with Christians</text>
  <text start="337.849" dur="3.75">or Buddhists or atheists or two Matic</text>
  <text start="340.099" dur="2.701">Jews or anything like that he makes it</text>
  <text start="341.599" dur="5.521">with the house of Israel in the house of</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="5.549">Judah just like it&amp;#39;s always been not</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="3">according to the Covenant that I made</text>
  <text start="348.349" dur="3.421">with their fathers in the day when I</text>
  <text start="350.12" dur="3.269">took them by the hand to lead them out</text>
  <text start="351.77" dur="4.889">of the land of egypt because they</text>
  <text start="353.389" dur="5.671">continued not in my covenant that was</text>
  <text start="356.659" dur="3.841">the fault they didn&amp;#39;t continue he did</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="2.699">had no problem with the Torah that he</text>
  <text start="360.5" dur="3">gave he had problem with them not</text>
  <text start="361.759" dur="3.75">continuing in it so let now listen to</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="3.09">what verse 10 says for this is the</text>
  <text start="365.509" dur="3.121">Covenant now we&amp;#39;re talking about the New</text>
  <text start="366.59" dur="3.509">Covenant this is the Covenant that I</text>
  <text start="368.63" dur="4.5">will make with the house of Israel after</text>
  <text start="370.099" dur="6.301">those days saith Yahweh I will put my</text>
  <text start="373.13" dur="5.37">laws my Torah my instructions into their</text>
  <text start="376.4" dur="3.75">mind and write them in their hearts and</text>
  <text start="378.5" dur="4.409">I will be to them a god and they shall</text>
  <text start="380.15" dur="3.739">be to me a people that&amp;#39;s the New</text>
  <text start="382.909" dur="4.711">Covenant folks</text>
  <text start="383.889" dur="5.14">he gets his laws his commandments that</text>
  <text start="387.62" dur="3.03">means keeping the Sabbath that means</text>
  <text start="389.029" dur="3.51">loving God with everything in you that</text>
  <text start="390.65" dur="4.259">means loving your neighbor that means</text>
  <text start="392.539" dur="3.66">wearing the ZZZ eat that means all these</text>
  <text start="394.909" dur="3.48">commandments that we can do in our</text>
  <text start="396.199" dur="2.93">present-day society he gives us an</text>
  <text start="398.389" dur="4.07">inward desire</text>
  <text start="399.129" dur="7.141">want to do that that&amp;#39;s the true gospel</text>
  <text start="402.459" dur="6.78">and furthermore as I say when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="406.27" dur="4.769">preaching Jesus said that wherever the</text>
  <text start="409.239" dur="4.47">true gospel is preached this story will</text>
  <text start="411.039" dur="5.34">be told and that is of that woman with</text>
  <text start="413.709" dur="6.121">that alabaster jar of oil and she pours</text>
  <text start="416.379" dur="5.64">that oil on the Messiah&amp;#39;s feet and her</text>
  <text start="419.83" dur="5.059">tears mingled with the oil she shows her</text>
  <text start="422.019" dur="5.1">utter love and adoration for the Messiah</text>
  <text start="424.889" dur="4.12">when you love him with everything in you</text>
  <text start="427.119" dur="3.03">you you of course you want to do is</text>
  <text start="429.009" dur="4.92">Torah you want to obey His commandments</text>
  <text start="430.149" dur="6.091">you want to keep his statutes and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="433.929" dur="2.97">process you greed and you grow it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="436.24" dur="3.299">you have to know all this stuff</text>
  <text start="436.899" dur="5.31">immediately it&amp;#39;s an ongoing process of</text>
  <text start="439.539" dur="5.43">continuing to learn his Torah but this</text>
  <text start="442.209" dur="5.67">is the New Covenant and any other gospel</text>
  <text start="444.969" dur="5.43">is false that&amp;#39;s right most of the modern</text>
  <text start="447.879" dur="5.611">Christianity gospel that says you just</text>
  <text start="450.399" dur="4.35">have to quote-unquote repent be covered</text>
  <text start="453.49" dur="2.429">by the blood of Jesus but you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="454.749" dur="3.39">to keep the Torah that&amp;#39;s all been nailed</text>
  <text start="455.919" dur="3.74">to the cross no you&amp;#39;re a totally</text>
  <text start="458.139" dur="3.96">misunderstanding what Paul wrote and</text>
  <text start="459.659" dur="4.451">again at the very top of my website I</text>
  <text start="462.099" dur="7.02">have a teaching as a 17 part series</text>
  <text start="464.11" dur="6.569">called reconciling Torah Messiah and</text>
  <text start="469.119" dur="2.91">Apostle Paul and it goes to all of</text>
  <text start="470.679" dur="3.3">Apostle Paul&amp;#39;s teachings throwing</text>
  <text start="472.029" dur="3.81">clearly Apostle Paul always taught to</text>
  <text start="473.979" dur="4.261">obey the Torah out of a love for Jesus</text>
  <text start="475.839" dur="5.03">just as Hebrews 8 says just as Matthew</text>
  <text start="478.24" dur="7.079">5:17 through 20 says and just as we read</text>
  <text start="480.869" dur="6.13">way back in the Book of Numbers that</text>
  <text start="485.319" dur="4.35">Joshua himself was filled with His Holy</text>
  <text start="486.999" dur="5.52">Spirit the Bible is a unified whole</text>
  <text start="489.669" dur="5.52">and what modern Christianity does is it</text>
  <text start="492.519" dur="4.14">tries to get the last third of the Bible</text>
  <text start="495.189" dur="4.02">to contradict the first two threads of</text>
  <text start="496.659" dur="4.44">the Bible that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="499.209" dur="5.36">truth modern Christianity has departed</text>
  <text start="501.099" dur="5.94">from what the Scriptures actually teach</text>

  <text start="507.039" dur="6.74">follow Jesus and do what he did</text>
