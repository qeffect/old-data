  <text start="69.42" dur="3.629">frames that are given in the Book of</text>

  <text start="102.39" dur="4.14">the Book of Daniel it&amp;#39;s the abomination</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="5.46">of desolation is set up and then 1290</text>
  <text start="106.53" dur="5.699">days later it comes to a swift in a</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="3.87">dropped end as Yahshua puts a stop to</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="3.861">the kingdoms of this world and</text>
  <text start="113.61" dur="7.56">transforms them into the kingdoms of</text>
  <text start="116.09" dur="8.2">Messiah hallelujah so I want to talk</text>
  <text start="121.17" dur="6.69">about a passage that fits into this</text>
  <text start="124.29" dur="5.969">timeline and it&amp;#39;s in Isaiah chapter 23</text>
  <text start="127.86" dur="6.06">and it&amp;#39;s the last portion of this</text>
  <text start="130.259" dur="5.751">chapter starting in verses 15</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="4.53">the end of the chapter in verse 18 says</text>
  <text start="136.01" dur="5.1">it shall come to pass in that day that</text>
  <text start="138.45" dur="5.94">tire shall be forgotten seventy years</text>
  <text start="141.11" dur="5.47">according to the days of one King after</text>
  <text start="144.39" dur="5.28">the end of 70 years shall tire sing as</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="6.54">an harlot taking heart go about the city</text>
  <text start="149.67" dur="5.88">the harlot that has been forgotten make</text>
  <text start="153.12" dur="4.949">sweet melody sing many songs that thou</text>
  <text start="155.55" dur="5.61">mayst be remembered and it shall come to</text>
  <text start="158.069" dur="5.791">pass after the end of 70 years that</text>
  <text start="161.16" dur="5.159">Yahweh will visit tire and she shall</text>
  <text start="163.86" dur="4.53">turn her higher and shall commit</text>
  <text start="166.319" dur="4.741">fornication with all the kingdoms of the</text>
  <text start="168.39" dur="4.349">world upon the face of the earth and her</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="4.2">merchandise and her higher shall be</text>
  <text start="172.739" dur="4.201">holiness to Yahweh it shall not be</text>
  <text start="175.26" dur="3.449">treasured nor laid up for her</text>
  <text start="176.94" dur="4.68">merchandise shall be for them that dwell</text>
  <text start="178.709" dur="5.851">before Yahweh to eat sufficiently and</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="6.42">for durable clothing What a curious</text>
  <text start="184.56" dur="5.88">passage now one thing that&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="188.04" dur="4.88">to note is that many chapters in Isaiah</text>
  <text start="190.44" dur="5.1">they have a historical film fulfillment</text>
  <text start="192.92" dur="4.27">in other words a fulfillment that</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="3.99">happened thousands of years ago during</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="4.169">the course of these nations but they</text>
  <text start="199.53" dur="3.269">also have another layer which is the</text>
  <text start="201.359" dur="4.25">prophetic fulfillment what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="202.799" dur="7.981">happen in the last days so for instance</text>
  <text start="205.609" dur="6.841">Isaiah 17 18 and 19 we read about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="210.78" dur="7.5">going to be happening in the last days</text>
  <text start="212.45" dur="8.44">to Samaria or to Syria and Isaiah 17 and</text>
  <text start="218.28" dur="4.64">then Isaiah 18 i believe involves israel</text>
  <text start="220.89" dur="5.49">in the united states and then Isaiah 19</text>
  <text start="222.92" dur="5.98">involves Egypt in the last days black</text>
  <text start="226.38" dur="4.59">wise and as a 23 even though there was a</text>
  <text start="228.9" dur="4.74">literal period of 70 years in which</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="6">Babylon sort of laid waste to tire</text>
  <text start="233.64" dur="6.439">before it had a resurgence there&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="7.17">a prophetic fulfillment of this</text>
  <text start="240.079" dur="6.13">scripture that is yet to be fulfilled if</text>
  <text start="244.14" dur="4.89">we go back to verse 15 and it shall come</text>
  <text start="246.209" dur="5.03">to pass in that day that tire shall be</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="4.799">forgotten seventy years now tyre is a</text>
  <text start="251.239" dur="5.53">city on the coast that was used to a lot</text>
  <text start="253.829" dur="5.9">of merchandising and trafficking you can</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="6.601">read about more about tire or also tyrus</text>
  <text start="259.729" dur="5.071">in Ezekiel and throughout other portions</text>
  <text start="263.37" dur="4.009">of the scripture</text>
  <text start="264.8" dur="5.399">but in its future prophetic fulfillment</text>
  <text start="267.379" dur="7.07">I believe tire is representative of the</text>
  <text start="270.199" dur="6.511">United Nations and let me tell you why</text>
  <text start="274.449" dur="4.481">says in verse 15 it shall come to pass</text>
  <text start="276.71" dur="4.56">in that day that tire shall be forgotten</text>
  <text start="278.93" dur="4.62">seventy years according to the days of</text>
  <text start="281.27" dur="4.35">one king after the end of 70 years shall</text>
  <text start="283.55" dur="6.69">tire singers and harlots okay so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.62" dur="8.57">verse 15 now if you read about the</text>
  <text start="290.24" dur="8.88">United Nations you will discover that on</text>
  <text start="294.19" dur="8.229">august twenty-first 1944 the dumbarton</text>
  <text start="299.12" dur="6.419">oaks conference was held through october</text>
  <text start="302.419" dur="4.291">7th 1944 this international conference</text>
  <text start="305.539" dur="3.06">was where the United Nations was</text>
  <text start="306.71" dur="5.07">formulated and negotiated among</text>
  <text start="308.599" dur="5.94">international leaders now listen to the</text>
  <text start="311.78" dur="5.939">there are four major proposals at this</text>
  <text start="314.539" dur="6.72">Dumbarton Oaks conference from august to</text>
  <text start="317.719" dur="6.241">october of 1944 that were basically</text>
  <text start="321.259" dur="5.37">brought forth to form the united nations</text>
  <text start="323.96" dur="5.13">number one to maintain international</text>
  <text start="326.629" dur="3.84">peace and security and to that end to</text>
  <text start="329.09" dur="3.27">take collective measures for the</text>
  <text start="330.469" dur="3.901">prevention and removal of threats to the</text>
  <text start="332.36" dur="3.48">peace and the suppression of acts of</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="3.72">aggression or other breaches of the</text>
  <text start="335.84" dur="4.169">peace and to bring about by peaceful</text>
  <text start="338.09" dur="3.629">means adjustment or settlement of</text>
  <text start="340.009" dur="4.351">international disputes which may lead to</text>
  <text start="341.719" dur="4.621">a breach of the peace number to develop</text>
  <text start="344.36" dur="3.209">friendly relations among nations and to</text>
  <text start="346.34" dur="4.56">take other appropriate measures to</text>
  <text start="347.569" dur="5.82">strengthen universal peace number three</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="4.59">to achieve international cooperations in</text>
  <text start="353.389" dur="3.9">the solution of international economic</text>
  <text start="355.49" dur="4.679">social and other humanitarian problems</text>
  <text start="357.289" dur="4.981">and number four to afford a center for</text>
  <text start="360.169" dur="5.191">harmonizing the actions of nations in</text>
  <text start="362.27" dur="5.579">the achievement of these comments now</text>
  <text start="365.36" dur="6.419">let me ask you a question have any of</text>
  <text start="367.849" dur="6.93">those four goals ever been achieved no</text>
  <text start="371.779" dur="6.331">they have not fact I would say that</text>
  <text start="374.779" dur="6.241">those four goals have been in a word</text>
  <text start="378.11" dur="5.7">forgotten they&amp;#39;ve never been achieved</text>
  <text start="381.02" dur="4.859">ever since they were formulated now I</text>
  <text start="383.81" dur="4.88">realized that the United States and the</text>
  <text start="385.879" dur="6.69">United Nations was not formally formally</text>
  <text start="388.69" dur="5.89">officially begun until a year later 1945</text>
  <text start="392.569" dur="4.53">but the reason why I&amp;#39;m referring to this</text>
  <text start="394.58" dur="3.47">Dumbarton Oaks conference in August to</text>
  <text start="397.099" dur="3.951">October of 19</text>
  <text start="398.05" dur="4.679">44 is because this is when the</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="3.54">resolutions of what would form the</text>
  <text start="402.729" dur="4.461">united nations were first brought forth</text>
  <text start="404.59" dur="5.1">and it&amp;#39;s these resolutions that were</text>
  <text start="407.19" dur="5.02">forgotten they were never realized in</text>
  <text start="409.69" dur="4.17">all the many years that have transpired</text>
  <text start="412.21" dur="6.449">that the United Nations has been in</text>
  <text start="413.86" dur="10.35">existence now if you go to my timeline</text>
  <text start="418.659" dur="10.621">again 1290 days prior to young through</text>
  <text start="424.21" dur="8.57">2017 is March 11 2014 when the</text>
  <text start="429.28" dur="6.3">abomination of desolation will occur and</text>
  <text start="432.78" dur="6.25">if you read in my second prophetic</text>
  <text start="435.58" dur="4.98">trilogy both the first article and the</text>
  <text start="439.03" dur="3.569">third article the prophetic sequence of</text>
  <text start="440.56" dur="5.88">events you&amp;#39;ll find out exactly what</text>
  <text start="442.599" dur="5.011">happens in 2014 but basically at the</text>
  <text start="446.44" dur="4.08">outside of this abomination of</text>
  <text start="447.61" dur="4.859">desolation the fourth trumpet blasts the</text>
  <text start="450.52" dur="5.88">fifth trumpet blasts six seals broken</text>
  <text start="452.469" dur="8.901">and from what we learn about the fifth</text>
  <text start="456.4" dur="7.199">trumpet it takes five months for Satan</text>
  <text start="461.37" dur="5.609">indwelling the intimus I to sort of</text>
  <text start="463.599" dur="6.271">consolidate his control over the earth</text>
  <text start="466.979" dur="7.021">and you can read more about why it takes</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="13.32">five months in Revelation chapter 9</text>
  <text start="474" dur="12.13">verse 5 so 5 months from March 11th 2014</text>
  <text start="483.19" dur="5.939">will take you to approximately August</text>
  <text start="486.13" dur="7.17">August eleventh around August of 2014</text>
  <text start="489.129" dur="7.5">and that&amp;#39;s when banta Messiah will have</text>
  <text start="493.3" dur="6.06">full control over the globe and if I had</text>
  <text start="496.629" dur="6.391">consulted his power now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="499.36" dur="6.239">interesting is that from August of 1944</text>
  <text start="503.02" dur="7.079">when this Dumbarton Oaks conference was</text>
  <text start="505.599" dur="10.141">held until August of 2014 is exactly 70</text>
  <text start="510.099" dur="6.961">years so for 70 years these initiatives</text>
  <text start="515.74" dur="3.239">of the United Nations have been</text>
  <text start="517.06" dur="6.149">forgotten they&amp;#39;ve had no teeth they have</text>
  <text start="518.979" dur="7.021">not accomplished really anything and</text>
  <text start="523.209" dur="5.671">then in verse 16 it says take a harp go</text>
  <text start="526" dur="5.76">about the city thou harlot that has been</text>
  <text start="528.88" dur="4.79">forgotten make sweet melody sing</text>
  <text start="531.76" dur="5.07">many songs that thou may&amp;#39;st be</text>
  <text start="533.67" dur="6.19">remembered and I should come to pass</text>
  <text start="536.83" dur="5.7">after the end of 70 years that Yahweh</text>
  <text start="539.86" dur="4.05">will visit tire and she shall turn to</text>
  <text start="542.53" dur="4.08">her higher and shall commit fornication</text>
  <text start="543.91" dur="5.91">with all the kingdoms of the world upon</text>
  <text start="546.61" dur="5.19">the face of the earth so at the end of</text>
  <text start="549.82" dur="4.74">70 years after the end of seven years</text>
  <text start="551.8" dur="5.58">after august of 2014 after Satan has</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="4.86">consolidated his grip across the globe</text>
  <text start="557.38" dur="4.56">then we have the United Nations actually</text>
  <text start="559.42" dur="5.31">fulfilling its goals that were</text>
  <text start="561.94" dur="5.57">formulated 70 years prior the Dumbarton</text>
  <text start="564.73" dur="5.67">Oaks conference in August of 1944 and</text>
  <text start="567.51" dur="4.39">the United Nations is now that harlot</text>
  <text start="570.4" dur="3.81">that is able to sing and commit</text>
  <text start="571.9" dur="4.59">fornication with all the nations of the</text>
  <text start="574.21" dur="4.97">earth and basically what we read about</text>
  <text start="576.49" dur="6.5">in revelation 17 and 18 Mystery Babylon</text>
  <text start="579.18" dur="8.2">including the horror and the Beast and</text>
  <text start="582.99" dur="7.78">so this is what then happens from August</text>
  <text start="587.38" dur="7.05">of 2014 until you know basically</text>
  <text start="590.77" dur="5.04">September of 2017 for three years hey</text>
  <text start="594.43" dur="3.39">say oh wait a minute Daniel wait a min</text>
  <text start="595.81" dur="4.59">Revelation says the Beast will rule for</text>
  <text start="597.82" dur="3.84">three and a half years for 42 months yes</text>
  <text start="600.4" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s true the abomination of</text>
  <text start="601.66" dur="5.49">desolation goes down in March of 2014</text>
  <text start="604.78" dur="5.19">but it takes about five months for Satan</text>
  <text start="607.15" dur="4.17">to fully consolidate his power over the</text>
  <text start="609.97" dur="3.42">globe and then you have the remaining</text>
  <text start="611.32" dur="4.14">three years and there is a three-year</text>
  <text start="613.39" dur="4.38">marker in the Book of Isaiah in fact if</text>
  <text start="615.46" dur="8.19">you go to a couple chapters just before</text>
  <text start="617.77" dur="8.7">Isaiah 23 go and Isaiah 20 starting in</text>
  <text start="623.65" dur="5.37">verse 3 it says and you always said like</text>
  <text start="626.47" dur="5.37">as my servant Isaiah has walked naked</text>
  <text start="629.02" dur="5.76">and barefoot three years for a sign and</text>
  <text start="631.84" dur="4.89">wonder unto Egypt and upon Ethiopia so</text>
  <text start="634.78" dur="4.38">shall the king of Assyria lead away the</text>
  <text start="636.73" dur="4.11">Egyptians prisoners and the Ethiopians</text>
  <text start="639.16" dur="3.03">captives young and old naked and</text>
  <text start="640.84" dur="3.54">barefoot given with their buttocks</text>
  <text start="642.19" dur="3.6">uncovered to the shame of Egypt now</text>
  <text start="644.38" dur="3.39">again that there was a historical</text>
  <text start="645.79" dur="5.31">fulfillment of this but this is also a</text>
  <text start="647.77" dur="4.89">prophetic there&amp;#39;s a prophetic layer to</text>
  <text start="651.1" dur="3.48">this and that is the king of Assyria is</text>
  <text start="652.66" dur="4.86">representative of the Antichrist he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="654.58" dur="5.46">going to be a terrible King over that</text>
  <text start="657.52" dur="4.68">whole region over Israel over a Syria</text>
  <text start="660.04" dur="4.71">which is north of Israel over Egypt and</text>
  <text start="662.2" dur="4.62">for three years because</text>
  <text start="664.75" dur="3.98">Isaiah prophesied naked for three years</text>
  <text start="666.82" dur="6.51">for three years he&amp;#39;s going to have full</text>
  <text start="668.73" dur="6.25">fierce control over that area so yes</text>
  <text start="673.33" dur="3.03">there is the 42 months three and half</text>
  <text start="674.98" dur="6.09">years but there&amp;#39;s also then a three year</text>
  <text start="676.36" dur="9.44">period as well within that going back to</text>
  <text start="681.07" dur="7.89">Isaiah 23 so we see that verse 15 is</text>
  <text start="685.8" dur="8.02">basically the time period between august</text>
  <text start="688.96" dur="9.03">of 1944 until August of 2014 then we see</text>
  <text start="693.82" dur="5.94">verses 16 and 17 is basically from late</text>
  <text start="697.99" dur="3.06">summer of two thousand fourteen until</text>
  <text start="699.76" dur="3.77">September of two thousand seven</text>
  <text start="701.05" dur="8.61">seventeen it&amp;#39;s the Great Tribulation and</text>
  <text start="703.53" dur="8.05">then in verse 18 we come to the Great</text>
  <text start="709.66" dur="4.17">Tribulation transitioning into the</text>
  <text start="711.58" dur="3.99">Millennial Kingdom says in her</text>
  <text start="713.83" dur="4.29">merchandise in her higher shall be</text>
  <text start="715.57" dur="4.17">holiness to Yahweh it shall not be</text>
  <text start="718.12" dur="3.15">treasured Nord laid up for her</text>
  <text start="719.74" dur="4.32">merchandise shall be for them that dwell</text>
  <text start="721.27" dur="4.65">before Yahweh to eat sufficiently and</text>
  <text start="724.06" dur="5.1">for dribble clothing so in other words</text>
  <text start="725.92" dur="5.1">all of the gold and and rubies and</text>
  <text start="729.16" dur="4.92">precious stuff that the United Nations</text>
  <text start="731.02" dur="5.4">beastly government&amp;#39;s horror collects and</text>
  <text start="734.08" dur="4.59">consumes and heaps upon herself during</text>
  <text start="736.42" dur="4.38">that tribulation period while she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="738.67" dur="4.56">persecuting the Saints will eventually</text>
  <text start="740.8" dur="5.22">be transferred to the Saints when</text>
  <text start="743.23" dur="5.6">Yahshua comes to rule and reign over all</text>
  <text start="746.02" dur="6.21">the earth during the millennial kingdom</text>
  <text start="748.83" dur="6.73">and we see this the this principle is in</text>
  <text start="752.23" dur="4.859">proverbs chapter 13 verse 22 where it</text>
  <text start="755.56" dur="5.16">says the wealth of the centre is laid up</text>
  <text start="757.089" dur="5.641">for the just we also see Isaiah 2318</text>
  <text start="760.72" dur="3.36">which again I think paints a picture of</text>
  <text start="762.73" dur="3.87">the transition from the Great</text>
  <text start="764.08" dur="5.58">Tribulation to the Millennial Kingdom in</text>
  <text start="766.6" dur="4.77">Isaiah chapter 60 as a chapter 60 is all</text>
  <text start="769.66" dur="3.81">about the very beginning of the lineal</text>
  <text start="771.37" dur="3.99">Kingdom so this is after yasho has</text>
  <text start="773.47" dur="3.03">resurrected his Saints we&amp;#39;ve met him in</text>
  <text start="775.36" dur="3.54">the air we&amp;#39;ve had the wedding supper</text>
  <text start="776.5" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;ve returned with Yahshua down to</text>
  <text start="778.9" dur="3.96">earth the Antichrist and his armies have</text>
  <text start="780.91" dur="3.72">been destroyed by the brightness of his</text>
  <text start="782.86" dur="3.51">coming he&amp;#39;s set foot on the Mount of</text>
  <text start="784.63" dur="3.48">Olives with us and his heavenly angels</text>
  <text start="786.37" dur="4.65">and he&amp;#39;s now ruling and reigning over</text>
  <text start="788.11" dur="5.22">Jerusalem and it says arise shine for</text>
  <text start="791.02" dur="5.31">your light has come and the glory</text>
  <text start="793.33" dur="4.56">Yahweh&amp;#39;s risen upon me for the whole the</text>
  <text start="796.33" dur="1.92">darkness shall cover the earth and grow</text>
  <text start="797.89" dur="2.07">strong</text>
  <text start="798.25" dur="3.99">as the people but Yahweh shall arise</text>
  <text start="799.96" dur="4.62">upon you and as glory shall be seen upon</text>
  <text start="802.24" dur="4.5">you and the Gentile shall come to your</text>
  <text start="804.58" dur="4.77">light and the king is the brightness of</text>
  <text start="806.74" dur="4.29">your rising who are these Gentiles and</text>
  <text start="809.35" dur="4.35">Kings these are people that survived the</text>
  <text start="811.03" dur="4.95">Great Tribulation that weren&amp;#39;t saved</text>
  <text start="813.7" dur="4.02">they didn&amp;#39;t repent so they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="815.98" dur="3.3">caught up in the first resurrection but</text>
  <text start="817.72" dur="4.41">they also did not take the mark of the</text>
  <text start="819.28" dur="4.65">beast and there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of</text>
  <text start="822.13" dur="3.51">those people around lift up your eyes</text>
  <text start="823.93" dur="3.33">round about and see all they gather</text>
  <text start="825.64" dur="4.14">themselves together they come to the</text>
