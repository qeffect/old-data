  <text start="15.48" dur="6.78">of the eighth month 17 of course being</text>
  <text start="18.119" dur="7.32">the day of victory I&amp;#39;ve gotten more</text>
  <text start="22.26" dur="5.22">confirmation that I definitely</text>
  <text start="25.439" dur="5.041">misapplied first Corinthians chapter 5</text>
  <text start="27.48" dur="4.889">11 with bogdan hans-peter from</text>
  <text start="30.48" dur="5.69">switzerland he he wrote me an email he</text>
  <text start="32.369" dur="6.841">said Daniel it took me a good 10 years</text>
  <text start="36.17" dur="5.2">before I understood and fully understood</text>
  <text start="39.21" dur="5.31">the need to get circumcised physically</text>
  <text start="41.37" dur="5.91">and aware the ZZ he said Daniel I</text>
  <text start="44.52" dur="5.25">believe that faith is like a seed that</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="4.74">you know Yahshua he plants that seed of</text>
  <text start="49.77" dur="4.32">the holy spirit in your heart when you</text>
  <text start="52.02" dur="4.26">first throw yourself at his feet and</text>
  <text start="54.09" dur="3.78">then that seed begins to grow and it</text>
  <text start="56.28" dur="4.11">gets bigger and bigger like a tree and</text>
  <text start="57.87" dur="4.14">as it grows you learn more and more</text>
  <text start="60.39" dur="3.21">about Yahshua you learn more and more</text>
  <text start="62.01" dur="3.719">about his word and you start obeying</text>
  <text start="63.6" dur="3.78">more and more of his Torah it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="65.729" dur="4.291">mean that you&amp;#39;re in sin it just means</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="4.38">that you&amp;#39;re growing and you&amp;#39;re learning</text>
  <text start="70.02" dur="3.29">and your understanding and we all of</text>
  <text start="71.76" dur="4.35">course the seed grows at different paces</text>
  <text start="73.31" dur="4.36">so that really really helped and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="76.11" dur="2.82">completely right when he spoke those</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="4.29">words to me I was like yes that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="78.93" dur="4.89">exactly what faith in Yahshua is we we</text>
  <text start="81.96" dur="3.57">get this seat of the Holy Spirit deep</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="4.02">within us when we first get saved and</text>
  <text start="85.53" dur="6.72">then it begins to slowly transform us</text>
  <text start="87.84" dur="6.06">from the inside out now for me I just</text>
  <text start="92.25" dur="3.119">started running as easy instantly as</text>
  <text start="93.9" dur="2.7">soon as I knew about it I just put them</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="3.36">on because I was like oh it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="96.6" dur="3.839">commandment I need to do it but I could</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="4.801">understand how it for others it may take</text>
  <text start="100.439" dur="6.121">longer and definitely first Corinthians</text>
  <text start="103.53" dur="5.04">5 is you know you do not ever eat or</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="3.96">have anyone join your fellowship who</text>
  <text start="108.57" dur="6.659">claims to be a lover of Yahshua but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="110.52" dur="8.82">in fornication or adultery or is you</text>
  <text start="115.229" dur="5.911">know a drunk or an idolaters so there is</text>
  <text start="119.34" dur="3.33">a proper place to apply that it just</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="3.21">wasn&amp;#39;t with bogging so anyway I just</text>
  <text start="122.67" dur="3.78">wanted to share that I think that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="124.35" dur="3.479">beautiful way of describing our faith in</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="2.61">Yahshua that&amp;#39;s like a seed that just</text>
  <text start="127.829" dur="4.05">grows and grows and grows and grows and</text>
  <text start="129.06" dur="4.64">gets bigger and bigger with that said we</text>
  <text start="131.879" dur="4.521">do need to be pressing into</text>
  <text start="133.7" dur="4.59">we do need to be wearing the ZZ we do</text>
  <text start="136.4" dur="4.41">need to be covering our heads we do need</text>
  <text start="138.29" dur="4.41">to be keeping the feast days and eating</text>
  <text start="140.81" dur="3.24">clean foods and doing all the jocks and</text>
  <text start="142.7" dur="3.78">titles in Torah out of a love for</text>
  <text start="144.05" dur="4.71">Yahshua and we especially need to be</text>
  <text start="146.48" dur="4.89">pressing in now because of how dark the</text>
  <text start="148.76" dur="4.979">days are when Paul describes in</text>
  <text start="151.37" dur="4.68">Ephesians 6 the armor of Yahweh you know</text>
  <text start="153.739" dur="3.771">the helmet of salvation the belt of</text>
  <text start="156.05" dur="4.409">truth the breastplate of righteousness</text>
  <text start="157.51" dur="6.309">each one of those pieces of armor has a</text>
  <text start="160.459" dur="5.25">corresponding commandment in Torah so</text>
  <text start="163.819" dur="4.801">for instance the helmet of salvation is</text>
  <text start="165.709" dur="5.041">like wearing our head covering the belt</text>
  <text start="168.62" dur="4.8">of truth is like wearing does easy on</text>
  <text start="170.75" dur="4.62">our ways the breastplate of</text>
  <text start="173.42" dur="5.19">righteousness that&amp;#39;s akin to the weather</text>
  <text start="175.37" dur="4.8">the high priest would wear that that</text>
  <text start="178.61" dur="3.57">breastplate that would have the 12</text>
  <text start="180.17" dur="3.72">stones of Israel and of course Yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="3.75">our high priest and we need to make sure</text>
  <text start="183.89" dur="3.629">Yahshua is seated on the throne of our</text>
  <text start="185.93" dur="3.66">hearts and regarding our hearts and not</text>
  <text start="187.519" dur="4.171">looking at anything filthy or allowing</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="4.619">anything to poison the Wellsprings of</text>
  <text start="191.69" dur="5.22">our hearts so every piece of armor that</text>
  <text start="194.209" dur="4.771">sha whoo Paul talks about in Ephesians 6</text>
  <text start="196.91" dur="4.409">has a corresponding commandment in Torah</text>
  <text start="198.98" dur="3.75">so we need to be keeping the physical</text>
  <text start="201.319" dur="3.181">commandments of Torah and then of course</text>
  <text start="202.73" dur="3.599">applying them spiritually as well and</text>
  <text start="204.5" dur="4.799">only then can we be fully protected and</text>
  <text start="206.329" dur="4.831">guarded for the times ahead so anyway I</text>
  <text start="209.299" dur="3.601">just wanted to share that this is part</text>
