  <text start="31.109" dur="5.511">he always breaks him in pieces first</text>
  <text start="33.649" dur="6.131">and I thought during this time of</text>
  <text start="36.62" dur="5.619">reflection and making sure that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="39.78" dur="4.23">the faith and repentance as we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="192.15" dur="3.959">having a ministry Torah restoration</text>
  <text start="194.67" dur="3.569">ministries I don&amp;#39;t deserve this and yet</text>
  <text start="196.109" dur="4.38">he&amp;#39;s given it to me so that I can have</text>
  <text start="198.239" dur="5.22">the honor for claiming who he is and and</text>
  <text start="200.489" dur="6.241">how to obey his word and at least what</text>
  <text start="203.459" dur="6.36">little I know I&amp;#39;m so grateful for</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="4.86">Yahshua the Messiah of Israel who has</text>
  <text start="209.819" dur="3.691">broken me and continues to break me</text>
  <text start="211.59" dur="5.25">because the more he breaks me the more I</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="5.52">fall in love with him to the point now</text>
  <text start="216.84" dur="5.85">where I actually look forward to the</text>
  <text start="219.03" dur="4.53">breaking because it just brings me</text>
  <text start="222.69" dur="5.129">closer to him</text>
  <text start="223.56" dur="7.56">it causes Daniel to degrease and yeah to</text>
  <text start="227.819" dur="4.5">increase and so this is my prayer for</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="4.199">all of those out there</text>
  <text start="232.319" dur="5.67">that you if you call yourself a part of</text>
  <text start="235.319" dur="4.441">the body of Messiah that you would</text>
  <text start="237.989" dur="3.411">decrease and that he would increase in</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="4.399">you</text>
  <text start="241.4" dur="4.74">if you&amp;#39;re a hypocrite you&amp;#39;re someone who</text>
  <text start="244.159" dur="4.261">once walked with him or maybe you never</text>
  <text start="246.14" dur="3.989">have but you claim you do and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.42" dur="4.02">still living in sin I pray this would</text>
  <text start="250.129" dur="4.621">convict you that you would get your life</text>
  <text start="252.44" dur="5.13">right and get in your face and stop</text>
  <text start="254.75" dur="4.53">playing games if you&amp;#39;re a sinner you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="257.57" dur="3.449">never even met the Messiah</text>
  <text start="259.28" dur="3.63">you&amp;#39;ve never even cared about the things</text>
  <text start="261.019" dur="4.62">of y&amp;#39;all or scriptures of the truth I</text>
  <text start="262.91" dur="4.83">pray I have a link on my website that</text>
