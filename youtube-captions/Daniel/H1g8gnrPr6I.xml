  <text start="0.68" dur="11.43">hello YouTube it is Sunday evening july</text>
  <text start="6.029" dur="9.871">the 13th 2008 um I wanted to talk about</text>
  <text start="12.11" dur="5.169">some I don&amp;#39;t know I get the sense that</text>
  <text start="15.9" dur="6.33">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people i was reading</text>
  <text start="17.279" dur="6.33">some some posts on the ron paul forums</text>
  <text start="22.23" dur="4.289">and i&amp;#39;ve just seen some other people on</text>
  <text start="23.609" dur="4.92">youtube and things and there&amp;#39;s seems</text>
  <text start="26.519" dur="3.721">like there&amp;#39;s this attitude amongst a lot</text>
  <text start="28.529" dur="5.341">of ron paul supporters that are</text>
  <text start="30.24" dur="4.92">basically saying that you know the</text>
  <text start="33.87" dur="4.23">presidential election doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="35.16" dur="6.51">matter anymore and we need to be the in</text>
  <text start="38.1" dur="5.34">this for the long haul and you know we</text>
  <text start="41.67" dur="3.33">need to look at long-term goals and</text>
  <text start="43.44" dur="4.529">things like that which is all fine and</text>
  <text start="45" dur="4.59">good but they seem to think that the</text>
  <text start="47.969" dur="3.93">convention the Republican National</text>
  <text start="49.59" dur="4.8">Convention that&amp;#39;s going to happen in st.</text>
  <text start="51.899" dur="5.09">Paul in September is a lost cause and</text>
  <text start="54.39" dur="5.34">that there is absolutely no chance that</text>
  <text start="56.989" dur="4.96">the convention will become a brokered</text>
  <text start="59.73" dur="5.88">convention that McCain will not get the</text>
  <text start="61.949" dur="5.731">nomination at Ron Paul will they saw a</text>
  <text start="65.61" dur="3.57">couple posts on the Ron Paul forms today</text>
  <text start="67.68" dur="5.43">that said that that&amp;#39;s a pipe dream and</text>
  <text start="69.18" dur="5.82">there&amp;#39;s no chance and I just I really</text>
  <text start="73.11" dur="3.81">strongly disagree with that I mean maybe</text>
  <text start="75" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;m just naive and I don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="3.839">how everything works but and believe me</text>
  <text start="79.32" dur="2.49">I understand that there&amp;#39;s the elite and</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="3.15">there&amp;#39;s the power brokers of the</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="3.33">Republican National Party that want to</text>
  <text start="83.909" dur="2.941">put forward their guy but the other</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="4.38">thing is is that the Republican National</text>
  <text start="86.85" dur="5.79">Party when it comes down to it they want</text>
  <text start="89.52" dur="4.68">to win and there was an article that</text>
  <text start="92.64" dur="3.089">came out in didn&amp;#39;t come out in the</text>
  <text start="94.2" dur="3.599">United States but came out in England in</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="4.021">the UK somebody posted it on the Ron</text>
  <text start="97.799" dur="3.871">Paul forums I don&amp;#39;t have a link with me</text>
  <text start="99.75" dur="3.75">but if you go to romp all forums you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="5.76">find it there I think under the</text>
  <text start="103.5" dur="6.24">grassroots topic but in any case there</text>
  <text start="107.43" dur="4.29">was an article and this analyst</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="4.589">basically suggested that there were a</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="4.53">lot of rumors right now that the GOP was</text>
  <text start="114.329" dur="4.951">looking to drop McCain now the article</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="5.88">did not mention rampal at all it talked</text>
  <text start="119.28" dur="4.799">about maybe the GP trying to look for</text>
  <text start="122.13" dur="4.23">someone like Colin Powell or Condoleezza</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="3.871">Rice or someone like that which I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="126.36" dur="3.86">know how that would work since none of</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="4.1">them have any delegates but</text>
  <text start="130.22" dur="3.65">then again maybe you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="132.05" dur="4.74">delegates I don&amp;#39;t know but in any case</text>
  <text start="133.87" dur="4.66">it just it suggested that the the</text>
  <text start="136.79" dur="4.8">Republican Party is beginning to realize</text>
  <text start="138.53" dur="6.54">that McCain is behind the polls he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="141.59" dur="5.21">competitive against Obama the GOP base</text>
  <text start="145.07" dur="3.75">is not excited about McCain</text>
  <text start="146.8" dur="4.66">conservatives don&amp;#39;t like him which is a</text>
  <text start="148.82" dur="5.67">major block of the Republican voters and</text>
  <text start="151.46" dur="5.22">the Republican establishment is really</text>
  <text start="154.49" dur="4.59">worried and they&amp;#39;re looking at possibly</text>
  <text start="156.68" dur="5.19">dropping McCain maybe McCain would drop</text>
  <text start="159.08" dur="4.5">out citing health reasons now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="3.57">know if that&amp;#39;s true or not but just the</text>
  <text start="163.58" dur="3.93">fact that someone&amp;#39;s writing about it not</text>
  <text start="165.44" dur="4.41">a Ron Paul supporter but actually just a</text>
  <text start="167.51" dur="4.199">news commentator out of England that</text>
  <text start="169.85" dur="4.35">someone&amp;#39;s saying that is pretty</text>
  <text start="171.709" dur="4.051">significant and I realized that lately I</text>
  <text start="174.2" dur="4.47">you knowed regiment a big deal i think</text>
  <text start="175.76" dur="6.99">on friday that the pole between Obama</text>
  <text start="178.67" dur="8.1">mccain is now even but i mean up until</text>
  <text start="182.75" dur="10.35">this point mccain Obama is that a huge a</text>
  <text start="186.77" dur="8.64">huge margin of just victory over mccain</text>
  <text start="193.1" dur="4.47">me he just has a lot more people excited</text>
  <text start="195.41" dur="4.98">about him and even with the the poll</text>
  <text start="197.57" dur="4.65">numbers tied like they are because I</text>
  <text start="200.39" dur="5.37">guess Obama&amp;#39;s made some gas or whatever</text>
  <text start="202.22" dur="6.81">over the last week it still seems that</text>
  <text start="205.76" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s no way McCain can win against</text>
  <text start="209.03" dur="2.97">Obama I mean when you have seventy to</text>
  <text start="211.22" dur="4.32">eighty percent of the american</text>
  <text start="212" dur="5.459">population against the war and obama</text>
  <text start="215.54" dur="4.919">saying he&amp;#39;s against the war mccain says</text>
  <text start="217.459" dur="6.451">he&amp;#39;s for it there&amp;#39;s just no way mccain</text>
  <text start="220.459" dur="5.491">can win so so you have you have people</text>
  <text start="223.91" dur="3.87">talking about this you have these rumors</text>
  <text start="225.95" dur="4.95">going around that the GOP may drop</text>
  <text start="227.78" dur="5.85">McCain there was a conference call that</text>
  <text start="230.9" dur="5.399">the delegates from Pennsylvania had with</text>
  <text start="233.63" dur="4.56">Ron and Carol Paul a couple weeks ago</text>
  <text start="236.299" dur="3.871">and they basically asked me I said look</text>
  <text start="238.19" dur="4.44">if we can get a majority of delegates</text>
  <text start="240.17" dur="4.59">from five states to nominate you from</text>
  <text start="242.63" dur="4.05">the from the floor of the convention</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="3.75">will you accept the nomination and Ron</text>
  <text start="246.68" dur="3.119">Paul said yes absolutely but it would</text>
  <text start="248.51" dur="5.58">have to completely be driven by the</text>
  <text start="249.799" dur="6.031">supporters so um so Ron Paul still open</text>
  <text start="254.09" dur="3.72">to it there&amp;#39;s delegates in Pennsylvania</text>
  <text start="255.83" dur="4.92">Ron Paul&amp;#39;s home state that are trying to</text>
  <text start="257.81" dur="5.609">get things organized as far as we know</text>
  <text start="260.75" dur="3.82">Nevada is going to be sending a slate of</text>
  <text start="263.419" dur="3.341">Ron Paul delegates</text>
  <text start="264.57" dur="4.05">a majority of ron paul delegates to the</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="3.18">convention although that&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="268.62" dur="4.83">tricky because there&amp;#39;s also going to be</text>
  <text start="269.94" dur="5.55">supposedly a republican national or</text>
  <text start="273.45" dur="3.87">state convention official state</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="4.14">convention at the end of july that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.32" dur="3.57">also planning to send us late but but</text>
  <text start="279.63" dur="3.72">just the fact that there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="280.89" dur="4.86">two slates battling it out and then the</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="3.87">people in Minneapolis st. Paul are going</text>
  <text start="285.75" dur="3.33">to have to figure it out there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="287.22" dur="4.05">to be a like a brawl I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="4.5">going to be intense conflict going on</text>
  <text start="291.27" dur="4.41">and one thing that&amp;#39;s article from</text>
  <text start="293.58" dur="4.5">England suggested was that the McCain</text>
  <text start="295.68" dur="5.52">nomination is not sure they said while</text>
  <text start="298.08" dur="5.04">Obama is pretty much the the nominee I</text>
  <text start="301.2" dur="5.25">mean he&amp;#39;s a shoo-in know Hillary&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="303.12" dur="5.43">going to challenge him the same thing is</text>
  <text start="306.45" dur="4.17">not the case for McCain and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="308.55" dur="3.99">lot up in the air so then the other</text>
  <text start="310.62" dur="5.22">thing that I was thinking about is you</text>
  <text start="312.54" dur="4.98">know I know that getting into conspiracy</text>
  <text start="315.84" dur="4.95">theories doesn&amp;#39;t really help or anything</text>
  <text start="317.52" dur="5.25">but thing is is that um McCain had like</text>
  <text start="320.79" dur="4.17">virtually no support going into the</text>
  <text start="322.77" dur="4.68">primaries I mean his campaign was dead</text>
  <text start="324.96" dur="4.47">and then all of a sudden he was winning</text>
  <text start="327.45" dur="3.6">primary after primary after primary</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="4.77">getting all this huge percentage of the</text>
  <text start="331.05" dur="4.65">vote whereas Ron Paul raises millions of</text>
  <text start="334.2" dur="3.96">dollars more money than any Republican</text>
  <text start="335.7" dur="4.8">candidate out there and yet he gets a</text>
  <text start="338.16" dur="4.23">small margin of every primary I mean I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="340.5" dur="3.93">sorry they cannot just be explained by</text>
  <text start="342.39" dur="3.99">you know older people who don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="344.43" dur="3.84">internet that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense so</text>
  <text start="346.38" dur="3.66">I mean it seems to me that the primaries</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="3.84">were obviously rigged the caucuses were</text>
  <text start="350.04" dur="4.98">rigged and that Ron Paul probably got a</text>
  <text start="352.11" dur="5.4">lot more of the vote then then then was</text>
  <text start="355.02" dur="4.26">let on so if the primaries and caucuses</text>
  <text start="357.51" dur="4.5">were stolen and there&amp;#39;s nothing we can</text>
  <text start="359.28" dur="4.56">do about it then it seems like we the</text>
  <text start="362.01" dur="4.32">people have an obligation to make sure</text>
  <text start="363.84" dur="5.01">that the delegates that are sent to the</text>
  <text start="366.33" dur="4.95">convention do all they can to make sure</text>
  <text start="368.85" dur="4.17">the people are represented I mean these</text>
  <text start="371.28" dur="3.75">delegates are people their average</text>
  <text start="373.02" dur="3.36">people like you and me that maybe</text>
  <text start="375.03" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re more politically minded but</text>
  <text start="376.38" dur="3.78">their people and they&amp;#39;re not part of the</text>
  <text start="378.39" dur="3.99">elite and these delegates are the ones</text>
  <text start="380.16" dur="3.45">that are voting from the nominee even</text>
  <text start="382.38" dur="3.6">the delegates that our pledge to vote</text>
  <text start="383.61" dur="4.02">for McCain they don&amp;#39;t have to vote for</text>
  <text start="385.98" dur="4.98">mccain in the first round they can</text>
  <text start="387.63" dur="4.98">abstain and I&amp;#39;m sorry but McCain does</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="5.94">not have an excited base I could</text>
  <text start="392.61" dur="5.38">certainly see a McCain pledged or bound</text>
  <text start="396.9" dur="2.68">delegate</text>
  <text start="397.99" dur="3.3">having second thoughts and possibly</text>
  <text start="399.58" dur="4.5">abstaining to turn the convention into a</text>
  <text start="401.29" dur="6.39">brokered one and then if the GOP is</text>
  <text start="404.08" dur="4.95">looking for a new nominee and so they</text>
  <text start="407.68" dur="3.42">sort of drop McCain or they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="409.03" dur="4.92">backing as much as they they they should</text>
  <text start="411.1" dur="4.68">and they drop him that gives Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="413.95" dur="3.45">supporters and opening again to say well</text>
  <text start="415.78" dur="4.2">look we got a guy that we know could</text>
  <text start="417.4" dur="5.55">beat obama and we know can actually</text>
  <text start="419.98" dur="8.28">still obama supporters so there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="422.95" dur="7.08">much that seems like says that ron paul</text>
  <text start="428.26" dur="4.32">could win the nomination plus even</text>
  <text start="430.03" dur="4.32">though I know it&amp;#39;s unlikely in terms of</text>
  <text start="432.58" dur="3.24">Ron Paul going into this convention with</text>
  <text start="434.35" dur="3.51">hardly any delegates and he&amp;#39;s not even</text>
  <text start="435.82" dur="3.96">been invited but the fact is there is</text>
  <text start="437.86" dur="4.14">historical precedent I mean Abraham</text>
  <text start="439.78" dur="5.64">Lincoln had fewer delegates than Ron</text>
  <text start="442" dur="5.85">Paul did and Abraham Lincoln wound up</text>
  <text start="445.42" dur="4.11">getting the nomination yes it&amp;#39;s unlikely</text>
  <text start="447.85" dur="4.32">yes it&amp;#39;s only happened I guess maybe</text>
  <text start="449.53" dur="4.32">once before maybe twice but all I know</text>
  <text start="452.17" dur="3.57">is of Abraham Lincoln but it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="453.85" dur="3.96">possible so there&amp;#39;s historical precedent</text>
  <text start="455.74" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s rumors that the GP want to drop</text>
  <text start="457.81" dur="4.98">McCain we know for a fact that the GOP</text>
  <text start="461.05" dur="5.82">base is not excited about McCain and</text>
  <text start="462.79" dur="7.77">that the huge money machine behind</text>
  <text start="466.87" dur="5.7">bushes terms are not behind the game we</text>
  <text start="470.56" dur="4.32">know that Obama is winning in the polls</text>
  <text start="472.57" dur="3.33">or is typically winning in the polls and</text>
  <text start="474.88" dur="4.35">even when they&amp;#39;re tied you&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="475.9" dur="5.31">saying Obama&amp;#39;s get a win so you know</text>
  <text start="479.23" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s a lot out there that suggests</text>
  <text start="481.21" dur="5.13">that we Ron Paul supporters have an</text>
  <text start="483.97" dur="4.08">opportunity but if we try to go to this</text>
  <text start="486.34" dur="3.18">convention if we try to you know and I</text>
  <text start="488.05" dur="3.39">definitely i&amp;#39;m encouraging everyone to</text>
  <text start="489.52" dur="4.38">go to the rally but go also to the</text>
  <text start="491.44" dur="5.28">Republican convention and try to reach</text>
  <text start="493.9" dur="4.56">these delegates I love the thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.72" dur="3.93">going on with they&amp;#39;re trying to get dvds</text>
  <text start="498.46" dur="4.47">in the hands of delegates have ron paul</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="4.98">signs try to reach as many delegates as</text>
  <text start="502.93" dur="4.41">possible and convince them about ron</text>
  <text start="505.63" dur="4.41">paul because then we could win this</text>
  <text start="507.34" dur="4.92">thing you really could I myself you know</text>
  <text start="510.04" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;m a public creature and I wanted to go</text>
  <text start="512.26" dur="3.03">and actually preach in front of the</text>
  <text start="514.18" dur="3.93">convention but I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="515.29" dur="4.47">going to happen because I have not been</text>
  <text start="518.11" dur="2.67">able to raise any money yet I had a few</text>
  <text start="519.76" dur="2.64">people that said they were going to send</text>
  <text start="520.78" dur="3.87">me something but nothing&amp;#39;s come in the</text>
  <text start="522.4" dur="4.32">mail so i don&amp;#39;t think i&amp;#39;ll be able to go</text>
  <text start="524.65" dur="4.86">to Minneapolis unless I certainly get a</text>
  <text start="526.72" dur="4.47">windfall of money but in any case anyone</text>
  <text start="529.51" dur="3">who can go should really</text>
  <text start="531.19" dur="3.96">to make the Republican National</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="4.59">Convention part of their stay there and</text>
  <text start="535.15" dur="4.41">in particular trying to focus and center</text>
  <text start="537.1" dur="4.11">on the delegates so I just wanted to put</text>
  <text start="539.56" dur="2.94">that out there to encourage ron paul</text>
  <text start="541.21" dur="3.3">supporters that we shouldn&amp;#39;t you know</text>
  <text start="542.5" dur="3.39">just automatically think ron paul is not</text>
  <text start="544.51" dur="3.36">going to win the nomination because i</text>
  <text start="545.89" dur="5.54">think there&amp;#39;s still a good chance he</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="3.56">could all right thank you</text>
