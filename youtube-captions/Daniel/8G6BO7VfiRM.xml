  <text start="31.949" dur="7.68">and I&amp;#39;m going to explore I think a</text>
  <text start="36.69" dur="7.65">message in that&amp;#39;s involved in Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="39.629" dur="6.961">that is not often explored and this is</text>
  <text start="44.34" dur="5.85">what Hanukkah is all about the message</text>

  <text start="50.19" dur="4.59">course it&amp;#39;s all about Yahshua just like</text>
  <text start="51.87" dur="4.619">all of these point toward Yahshua but</text>
  <text start="54.78" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s something very specific about</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="4.71">this time of year that Yasha wants us to</text>
  <text start="59.16" dur="5.34">look at and I want to start with</text>
  <text start="61.199" dur="7.311">Yahshua&amp;#39;s own words how many of you know</text>
  <text start="64.5" dur="8.07">that Yahshua actually was up at the</text>
  <text start="68.51" dur="6.13">temple on solomon&amp;#39;s porch during the</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="5.64">feast of dedication during the feast of</text>
  <text start="74.64" dur="11.76">Hanukkah it&amp;#39;s true it&amp;#39;s in John chapter</text>
  <text start="78.21" dur="10.619">9 verse 22 and this is what it says and</text>

  <text start="92.82" dur="7.409">hanukkah and Yasha walked in the temple</text>
  <text start="96.03" dur="6.78">of Solomon&amp;#39;s porch now I want you to pay</text>
  <text start="100.229" dur="5.731">real close attention to what Yahshua</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="4.949">talks about during this feast then came</text>
  <text start="105.96" dur="5.4">the Jews round about him and said it in</text>
  <text start="107.759" dur="5.991">how long do you make us to doubt if you</text>
  <text start="111.36" dur="4.59">be the Christ tell us plainly and</text>
  <text start="113.75" dur="5.049">Yahshua answered them and said I told</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="4.5">you and you believe not the works that I</text>
  <text start="118.799" dur="4.53">do in my father&amp;#39;s name they bear witness</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="5.43">of me but you believe not because you</text>
  <text start="123.329" dur="4.951">are not of my sheep as I said unto you</text>
  <text start="125.88" dur="5.249">my sheep hear my voice and I know them</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="5.07">and they follow me and I gave unto them</text>
  <text start="131.129" dur="4.291">eternal life and they shall never perish</text>
  <text start="133.35" dur="6.12">Shh neither shall any pluck them out of</text>
  <text start="135.42" dur="6.27">my hand my father gave them to me and he</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="3.9">is greater than all and no man is able</text>
  <text start="141.69" dur="5.34">to pluck them out of my father&amp;#39;s hand I</text>
  <text start="143.37" dur="6.32">and the father are one then the Jews</text>
  <text start="147.03" dur="5.01">took up stones again to stone him and</text>
  <text start="149.69" dur="3.85">Yahshua answered them said many good</text>
  <text start="152.04" dur="3.78">works have I showed you for my father</text>
  <text start="153.54" dur="4.95">for which of those works do you stone me</text>
  <text start="155.82" dur="4.38">and the Jews answer him saying for a</text>
  <text start="158.49" dur="4.62">good work we stone you not but for</text>
  <text start="160.2" dur="6.02">blasphemy because that bow being a man</text>
  <text start="163.11" dur="5.4">makes herself Yahweh and Yahshua</text>
  <text start="166.22" dur="6.34">answered and said is it not written in</text>
  <text start="168.51" dur="5.82">your Torah I said ye are gods if he</text>
  <text start="172.56" dur="3.75">called them gods unto whom the word of</text>
  <text start="174.33" dur="4.8">Yahweh came and the scripture cannot be</text>
  <text start="176.31" dur="5.04">broken say ye of him whom the father has</text>
  <text start="179.13" dur="4.35">sanctified and sent into the world you</text>
  <text start="181.35" dur="4.83">blasphemous because i said i am the son</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="4.89">of y&amp;#39;all if i do not the works of my</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="4.44">father believed me not but if I do</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="4.8">though you believe not me believe the</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="5.21">works that you may know and believe that</text>
  <text start="193.17" dur="5.22">the father is in me and I in him</text>
  <text start="195.83" dur="6.91">therefore they saw again to take him but</text>
  <text start="198.39" dur="7.5">Yahshua escaped out of their hand the</text>
  <text start="202.74" dur="5.04">message during Hanukkah during the feast</text>
  <text start="205.89" dur="4.14">of dedication has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="207.78" dur="4.97">throwing dreidels or eating latkes</text>
  <text start="210.03" dur="5.57">that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not the message of Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="212.75" dur="7.18">the message of Hanukkah is</text>
  <text start="215.6" dur="5.59">sanctification and dedication see he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="219.93" dur="2.52">pointing out to these religious</text>
  <text start="221.19" dur="3.75">Pharisees he&amp;#39;s saying you know what you</text>
  <text start="222.45" dur="5.85">don&amp;#39;t even know who I am you have no</text>
  <text start="224.94" dur="5.28">clue who I am you&amp;#39;re dressed in all your</text>
  <text start="228.3" dur="6.96">religious garb but you don&amp;#39;t know me my</text>
  <text start="230.22" dur="6.3">sheep know me they know my voice how</text>
  <text start="235.26" dur="3.6">does he proved that they don&amp;#39;t know who</text>
  <text start="236.52" dur="4.86">he is well he says he&amp;#39;s the very</text>
  <text start="238.86" dur="6.18">expressed image of the father of Yahweh</text>
  <text start="241.38" dur="5.7">and the these religious Pharisees are so</text>
  <text start="245.04" dur="6.54">incensed by this they take up stones to</text>
  <text start="247.08" dur="8.57">stone him Yahshua the light of the world</text>
  <text start="251.58" dur="8.969">the very expressed image of the father</text>
  <text start="255.65" dur="10.68">he shows a division between the sheep</text>
  <text start="260.549" dur="8.18">and the goats now long before</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="5.22">a few hundred years before Hanukkah was</text>
  <text start="268.729" dur="5.551">ever established during the Maccabee</text>
  <text start="271.55" dur="3.899">revolt we can go to scripture and find</text>
  <text start="274.28" dur="6.75">out something else that happened during</text>
  <text start="275.449" dur="9.451">this season ezra chapter 10 starting in</text>
  <text start="281.03" dur="5.49">verse 9 then all the men of Yehuda and</text>
  <text start="284.9" dur="4.16">Benjamin gathered themselves together</text>
  <text start="286.52" dur="5.369">until Russia Lane within three days I</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="4.24">was on the ninth month on the twentieth</text>
  <text start="291.889" dur="4.071">day of the month so this would be now</text>
  <text start="293.3" dur="4.589">five days before Hanukkah begins which</text>
  <text start="295.96" dur="4.239">starts on the twenty-fifth of the ninth</text>
  <text start="297.889" dur="4.381">month and all the people sat in the</text>
  <text start="300.199" dur="3.78">street of the house of Yahweh trembling</text>
  <text start="302.27" dur="4.649">because of this matter and for the great</text>
  <text start="303.979" dur="5.22">rain and Ezra the priest stood up and</text>
  <text start="306.919" dur="4.74">said unto them you have transgressed and</text>
  <text start="309.199" dur="5.43">I&amp;#39;ve taken strange wives to increase the</text>
  <text start="311.659" dur="5.16">trespass of Israel now therefore make</text>
  <text start="314.629" dur="4.951">confession unto yahweh elohim of your</text>
  <text start="316.819" dur="4.741">fathers and do his pleasure and separate</text>
  <text start="319.58" dur="4.47">yourself from the people of a land and</text>
  <text start="321.56" dur="3.9">from the strange wives then all the</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="3.959">congregation answered and said with a</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="5.4">loud voice as you have said so must we</text>
  <text start="328.009" dur="4.65">do but the people are many and it is a</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="3.929">time of much rain and we are not able to</text>
  <text start="332.659" dur="4.021">stand without either is this a work of</text>
  <text start="334.789" dur="4.231">one day or two for we are many that have</text>
  <text start="336.68" dur="4.68">transgressed in this thing but now our</text>
  <text start="339.02" dur="4.019">rulers of all the congregation stand and</text>
  <text start="341.36" dur="3.57">let all them which have taken strange</text>
  <text start="343.039" dur="4.141">wives in our cities come at appointed</text>
  <text start="344.93" dur="4.26">times and with them the elders of every</text>
  <text start="347.18" dur="4.47">city and the judges there up until the</text>
  <text start="349.19" dur="5.64">fierce wrath of our yah for this matter</text>
  <text start="351.65" dur="5.43">returned from us only yonathan the son</text>
  <text start="354.83" dur="4.079">of a CL and y hacia the son of tikva</text>
  <text start="357.08" dur="3.959">were employed about this matter and</text>
  <text start="358.909" dur="4.111">michelin and shabby thought I leave I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="361.039" dur="4.291">helped them and the children of the</text>
  <text start="363.02" dur="4.319">captivity did so and as are the priests</text>
  <text start="365.33" dur="3.48">with certain chief of the fathers after</text>
  <text start="367.339" dur="3.57">the house of their fathers and all of</text>
  <text start="368.81" dur="4.919">them by their names were separated and</text>
  <text start="370.909" dur="6.6">sat down in the first day of the tenth</text>
  <text start="373.729" dur="5.28">month to examine the matter first day of</text>
  <text start="377.509" dur="3">the tenth month I remember Hanukkah goes</text>
  <text start="379.009" dur="3.75">from the 25th day of the ninth month</text>
  <text start="380.509" dur="4.62">until the third day of the tenth month</text>
  <text start="382.759" dur="4.5">so this would be right in the midst of</text>
  <text start="385.129" dur="5.01">Hanukkah when this is a when this is</text>
  <text start="387.259" dur="4.08">occurring starting you know five days</text>
  <text start="390.139" dur="3.421">before and then going right into the</text>
  <text start="391.339" dur="4.281">midst of Hanukkah so this is again all</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="4.529">about separation about purified</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="4.23">purification about dedicating yourself</text>
  <text start="398.089" dur="4.651">to Yahweh</text>
  <text start="399.85" dur="5.86">but then we have an even deeper message</text>
  <text start="402.74" dur="6.239">about Hanukkah presented in the book of</text>
  <text start="405.71" dur="6.59">Haggai Haggai is one of those books that</text>
  <text start="408.979" dur="5.881">are often is often overlooked because</text>
  <text start="412.3" dur="6.55">it&amp;#39;s a minor prophet and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="414.86" dur="7.14">don&amp;#39;t tend to read these but it does</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="6.409">mention the season of Hanukkah now again</text>
  <text start="422" dur="6.15">this is of course you know several</text>
  <text start="425.259" dur="4.75">hundred years before the Maccabee revolt</text>
  <text start="428.15" dur="4.65">but it&amp;#39;s still the same season of</text>
  <text start="430.009" dur="6.391">Hanukkah if you go to Haggai chapter 2</text>
  <text start="432.8" dur="5.16">starting in verse 10 in the 24th day of</text>
  <text start="436.4" dur="3.96">the ninth month okay so that would be</text>

  <text start="640.9" dur="5.43">time of purification it&amp;#39;s a time of</text>
  <text start="643.63" dur="7.05">separation this is what it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="646.33" dur="6.81">and the season was established long</text>
  <text start="650.68" dur="6.21">before the Maccabee in revolt and it</text>
  <text start="653.14" dur="6.06">continued after when Yahshua again</text>
  <text start="656.89" dur="3.9">brought the same type of message when he</text>
  <text start="659.2" dur="5.58">had a confrontation with the pharisees</text>
  <text start="660.79" dur="5.5">on the Temple Mount this is what</text>
  <text start="664.78" dur="3.91">Hanukkah is about</text>
  <text start="666.29" dur="5.31">and this is the only way we can be a</text>
  <text start="668.69" dur="5.93">light to the world is by having him</text>
  <text start="671.6" dur="6.179">Yahshua HaMashiach the King of Kings</text>
  <text start="674.62" dur="5.35">dwelling within us be who is the light</text>
  <text start="677.779" dur="3.601">of the world allowing him to shine</text>
  <text start="679.97" dur="6.03">through us so that we can be a light to</text>
  <text start="681.38" dur="8.34">others but that light can&amp;#39;t be murky it</text>
  <text start="686" dur="5.85">can&amp;#39;t be a mixture it has to be pure it</text>
  <text start="689.72" dur="3.45">has to be pure and the only way that</text>
  <text start="691.85" dur="3.87">that light of course can be pure is</text>
  <text start="693.17" dur="4.859">Joshua dwelling within us and teaching</text>
  <text start="695.72" dur="4.77">us how to obey His Word and keep his</text>
  <text start="698.029" dur="4.651">Commandments and I think more than</text>
  <text start="700.49" dur="5.49">anything else this is what Hanukkah is</text>
  <text start="702.68" dur="6">about a time to rededicate yourself a</text>
  <text start="705.98" dur="5.729">time to love him with all your heart</text>
  <text start="708.68" dur="5.88">soul mind and strength of time to take</text>
  <text start="711.709" dur="5.281">stock and see hey have I joined myself</text>
  <text start="714.56" dur="4.649">to anything that&amp;#39;s strange that&amp;#39;s not of</text>
  <text start="716.99" dur="6.18">yah that is that is wrong that is</text>
  <text start="719.209" dur="6.12">polluting me am i truly a sheep am i</text>
  <text start="723.17" dur="4.349">truly following him or am I just sort of</text>
  <text start="725.329" dur="4.051">wearing their religious garden and and</text>
  <text start="727.519" dur="5.19">doing these things but but don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="729.38" dur="5.189">have an intimacy with him and I think is</text>
  <text start="732.709" dur="3.601">what message of Hanukkah and the feast</text>
  <text start="734.569" dur="5.88">of dedication should be all about you</text>
  <text start="736.31" dur="6.63">know incidentally the Maccabees they</text>
  <text start="740.449" dur="4.89">could not have overcome those impossible</text>
  <text start="742.94" dur="5.31">odds against that pagan Greek culture of</text>
  <text start="745.339" dur="6.75">mixture if they did not have absolute</text>
  <text start="748.25" dur="6.42">fidelity to Yahweh in his word it was a</text>
  <text start="752.089" dur="5.73">miracle it was a miracle that they were</text>
  <text start="754.67" dur="5.099">able to overcome those odds and that</text>
  <text start="757.819" dur="5.64">miracle came because they refuse to</text>
  <text start="759.769" dur="8.911">compromise Yahshua will give us miracles</text>
  <text start="763.459" dur="7.651">too but those miracles come because we</text>
  <text start="768.68" dur="6.75">are willing to stand for him and not</text>
  <text start="771.11" dur="8.219">compromise and love him in every part of</text>
  <text start="775.43" dur="6.389">our life hallelujah I hope you remember</text>
