  <text start="123.509" dur="4.021">continue to read on this day of</text>
  <text start="125.79" dur="4.29">firstfruits is also important that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="4.86">the first countdown the counting of the</text>
  <text start="130.08" dur="3.11">Omer that is a fifty day countdown to</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="2.99">the next</text>
  <text start="133.19" dur="3.87">bringing feasts with the Shavuot so</text>
  <text start="135.38" dur="3.45">firstfruits is actually a very very</text>
  <text start="137.06" dur="4.85">important day because it begins that</text>
  <text start="138.83" dur="7.68">fifty day countdown to shadow out and</text>
  <text start="141.91" dur="7.36">determines wind shad what will be and of</text>
  <text start="146.51" dur="5.19">course this day is important because not</text>
  <text start="149.27" dur="4.98">only was it the the day that the</text>
  <text start="151.7" dur="4.95">Israelites who bring their first sheaf</text>
  <text start="154.25" dur="4.44">of their barley harvest to the high</text>
  <text start="156.65" dur="4.23">priest to wave as a Thanksgiving</text>
  <text start="158.69" dur="4.65">offering for yah sustaining them but</text>
  <text start="160.88" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s symbolic of Yahshua&amp;#39;s resurrection</text>
  <text start="163.34" dur="7.37">and ascension so it&amp;#39;s spoken of directly</text>
  <text start="166.13" dur="7.56">by Paul in 1st Corinthians chapter 15</text>
  <text start="170.71" dur="5.32">where it says in verse 20 but now is</text>
  <text start="173.69" dur="5.1">Messiah risen from the dead and become</text>
  <text start="176.03" dur="4.8">the firstfruits of them that slept for</text>
  <text start="178.79" dur="4.29">since by man came death by man came also</text>
  <text start="180.83" dur="4.56">the resurrection of the dead for as in</text>
  <text start="183.08" dur="3.9">Adam all die even so in Messiah shall</text>
  <text start="185.39" dur="4.26">all be made alive but every man in his</text>
  <text start="186.98" dur="4.89">own order Messiah the firstfruits and</text>
  <text start="189.65" dur="2.73">afterward they that are messiahs at his</text>
  <text start="191.87" dur="4.14">coming</text>
  <text start="192.38" dur="5.7">so Yahshua is the first fruit from among</text>
  <text start="196.01" dur="4.77">the dead he fulfills this feast of</text>
  <text start="198.08" dur="4.68">firstfruits again every year for</text>
  <text start="200.78" dur="4.02">thousands of years the Israelites would</text>
  <text start="202.76" dur="3.51">bring a first shock of their barley</text>
  <text start="204.8" dur="3.18">harvest which is the very first harvest</text>
  <text start="206.27" dur="4.08">of the year it&amp;#39;s in the early spring and</text>
  <text start="207.98" dur="3.78">they would bring a shock of their barley</text>
  <text start="210.35" dur="3.51">harvest the first sheaf of their barley</text>
  <text start="211.76" dur="4.32">harvest up with them to Jerusalem to</text>
  <text start="213.86" dur="4.74">celebrate Passover and on the morrow</text>
  <text start="216.08" dur="5.19">after the Sabbath within Passover week</text>
  <text start="218.6" dur="5.1">so whatever day that Saturday night to</text>
  <text start="221.27" dur="3.87">Sunday night fell on in the midst of the</text>
  <text start="223.7" dur="3.12">seven days of unleavened bread they</text>
  <text start="225.14" dur="3.36">would then bring that shock up to the</text>
  <text start="226.82" dur="5.79">high priest and the high priest would</text>
  <text start="228.5" dur="6.51">wave that shock of barley before Yahweh</text>
  <text start="232.61" dur="5.07">and then there was a detailed sacrifice</text>
  <text start="235.01" dur="4.68">that would go along with that they would</text>
  <text start="237.68" dur="4.47">do this every year as a sort of a</text>
  <text start="239.69" dur="3.78">Thanksgiving acknowledging that yah was</text>
  <text start="242.15" dur="4.38">sustaining them and giving them their</text>
  <text start="243.47" dur="4.35">first harvest of the year to survive and</text>
  <text start="246.53" dur="2.58">this was done every year on the morrow</text>
  <text start="247.82" dur="4.32">after the Sabbath and of course if we</text>
  <text start="249.11" dur="5.61">could skip forward then to Yahshua being</text>
  <text start="252.14" dur="4.98">the Passover lamb of course he died on</text>
  <text start="254.72" dur="4.139">Passover he was buried for unleavened</text>
  <text start="257.12" dur="2.94">bread and the firstfruits the feast of</text>
  <text start="258.859" dur="3.571">firstfruits which would have been from</text>
  <text start="260.06" dur="4.65">Saturday night to Sunday night that is</text>
  <text start="262.43" dur="3.56">when he rose he rose from the dead late</text>
  <text start="264.71" dur="3.109">Sabbath</text>
  <text start="265.99" dur="2.85">and then early in the morning on Sunday</text>
  <text start="267.819" dur="2.671">which would have been the feasts of</text>
  <text start="268.84" dur="4.139">firstfruits that year that&amp;#39;s what Miriam</text>
  <text start="270.49" dur="4.859">and the other women found the empty tomb</text>
  <text start="272.979" dur="5.131">and of course then it was described by</text>
  <text start="275.349" dur="5.641">Joshua had risen from the grave Mary</text>
  <text start="278.11" dur="4.95">then actually meets the risen Yahshua</text>
  <text start="280.99" dur="4.29">and wants to embrace him but he says</text>
  <text start="283.06" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t touch me because I&amp;#39;ve not yet</text>
  <text start="285.28" dur="3.93">ascended to the Father so he still</text>
  <text start="287.38" dur="3.509">needed to go up to the Father and wave</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="3.87">himself as the first shoot from among</text>
  <text start="290.889" dur="3.331">the dead as Paul talks about in first</text>
  <text start="293.08" dur="2.25">Corinthians 15 so that&amp;#39;s how he</text>
  <text start="294.22" dur="4.62">fulfilled this feast</text>
  <text start="295.33" dur="5.1">so the question often arises will how</text>
  <text start="298.84" dur="4.109">come the feast of firstfruits with it</text>
  <text start="300.43" dur="4.049">being so important I mean it&amp;#39;s the day</text>
  <text start="302.949" dur="4.111">that Yahshua rose from the dead and</text>
  <text start="304.479" dur="4.081">ascended to the Father and presented</text>
  <text start="307.06" dur="4.259">himself as the first true from among the</text>
  <text start="308.56" dur="5.37">dead how come it&amp;#39;s not a Sabbath why is</text>
  <text start="311.319" dur="4.861">this not a Shabbat well the reason it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="313.93" dur="4.109">not a Sabbath is because the feasts for</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="3.419">a firstfruits is a lot of work I mean he</text>
  <text start="318.039" dur="3.331">rose from the dead and he sent it to</text>
  <text start="319.599" dur="4.621">heaven that&amp;#39;s a lot of work that he did</text>
  <text start="321.37" dur="4.919">on that day and the Israelites</text>
  <text start="324.22" dur="3.9">themselves it was a work day because</text>
  <text start="326.289" dur="3.181">they would get their sheep they would go</text>
  <text start="328.12" dur="2.4">to the temple they&amp;#39;d bring the Sheep to</text>
  <text start="329.47" dur="2.31">the high priest the high priest would be</text>
  <text start="330.52" dur="3.389">waving these Chiefs all day long</text>
  <text start="331.78" dur="4.41">starting probably Saturday night going</text>
  <text start="333.909" dur="5.371">through Sunday so it was a day of work</text>
  <text start="336.19" dur="6.18">just like Passover was a day of work and</text>
  <text start="339.28" dur="5.1">of course it&amp;#39;s celebrating the fact that</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="3.299">he rose from the dead he&amp;#39;s resurrected</text>
  <text start="344.38" dur="2.879">he&amp;#39;s the first fruits around the dead</text>
  <text start="345.669" dur="3.84">because He fulfilled the feasts of</text>
  <text start="347.259" dur="3.72">firstfruits 2,000 years ago because he</text>
  <text start="349.509" dur="3.451">is the firstfruits from among the dead</text>
  <text start="350.979" dur="3.99">because he did present himself as the</text>
  <text start="352.96" dur="3.269">first fruit offering of the Father that</text>
  <text start="354.969" dur="3.48">is what gives us hope for our future</text>
  <text start="356.229" dur="3.69">resurrection which will be fulfilled in</text>
  <text start="358.449" dur="3.12">the Feast of Trumpets yom teruah</text>
  <text start="359.919" dur="4.441">which is the first of the fall feasts</text>
  <text start="361.569" dur="3.53">that we celebrate in September or</text>
  <text start="364.36" dur="2.94">October</text>
  <text start="365.099" dur="3.461">so this feast is actually a very</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="4.35">important feast there&amp;#39;s several verses</text>
  <text start="368.56" dur="4.55">that are devoted to this feast in</text>
  <text start="371.65" dur="3.84">Leviticus 23</text>
  <text start="373.11" dur="4.929">so it&amp;#39;s definitely not it not a day to</text>
  <text start="375.49" dur="3.69">overlook but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not a Sabbath</text>
  <text start="378.039" dur="4.291">either it&amp;#39;s a work day I&amp;#39;m actually</text>
