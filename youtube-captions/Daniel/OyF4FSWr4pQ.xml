  <text start="13.74" dur="3.379">bring you along as I answer some</text>
  <text start="15.75" dur="4.41">questions that I&amp;#39;ve been getting I</text>
  <text start="17.119" dur="6.371">apologize for the sort of the shadiness</text>
  <text start="20.16" dur="5.939">of the video but I can&amp;#39;t wreck out</text>
  <text start="23.49" dur="4.859">smashed so kind of looks like that right</text>
  <text start="26.099" dur="4.02">now and the picture quality is not good</text>
  <text start="28.349" dur="3.061">I could switch over and use the camera</text>
  <text start="30.119" dur="5.251">on the back but then every time I do</text>
  <text start="31.41" dur="6.5">that my hand touches the ipad and it</text>
  <text start="35.37" dur="4.38">shuts off the video so hopefully</text>
  <text start="37.91" dur="5.38">actually it&amp;#39;s kind of cool looks like</text>
  <text start="39.75" dur="5.489">we&amp;#39;re sort of in a dream helloo yeah</text>
  <text start="43.29" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s a very beautiful place by the way</text>
  <text start="45.239" dur="3.631">and i&amp;#39;m at i&amp;#39;m in the middle of the</text>
  <text start="46.77" dur="5.94">forest here deep in the Cascade</text>
  <text start="48.87" dur="4.89">Mountains a little a little veranda here</text>
  <text start="52.71" dur="6.54">just out in the middle of nowhere huh</text>
  <text start="53.76" dur="11.609">it&amp;#39;s kind of cool okay hallelujah well I</text>
  <text start="59.25" dur="8.82">want to answer some questions here got a</text>
  <text start="65.369" dur="6.151">question about Daniel chapter 9 verses</text>
  <text start="68.07" dur="8.49">26 and 27 so we&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="71.52" dur="6.81">confirmation of the Covenant and how</text>
  <text start="76.56" dur="3.3">Lindsay and all the prophecy experts and</text>
  <text start="78.33" dur="3.27">teachers have always taught that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="79.86" dur="4.47">the anthem Messiah the Antichrist who</text>
  <text start="81.6" dur="4.769">will confirm this covenant for seven</text>
  <text start="84.33" dur="3.42">years of Israel I&amp;#39;m the Covenant gets</text>
  <text start="86.369" dur="3.96">broken in the midst of the seven years</text>
  <text start="87.75" dur="4.68">and blah blah blah blah but I do believe</text>
  <text start="90.329" dur="7.021">that that passage is being</text>
  <text start="92.43" dur="9.03">misinterpreted Daniel chapter 9 verse 26</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="7.1">and 27 they are parallel passages okay</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="7.71">so what I mean by that is if you read</text>
  <text start="104.45" dur="9.279">verse 26 it starts off with the Messiah</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="8.01">of Israel with Yahshua and he this Creek</text>
  <text start="113.729" dur="6.591">is beautiful just let you guys see that</text>
  <text start="117.18" dur="3.14">if you can see it</text>
  <text start="124.649" dur="8.111">anyway in verse 26 it starts off with</text>
  <text start="129.25" dur="5.34">Joshua who basically is cut off not for</text>
  <text start="132.76" dur="3.93">himself that he&amp;#39;s our atoning sacrifice</text>
  <text start="134.59" dur="3.42">and then the last half of that verse</text>
  <text start="136.69" dur="3.269">talks about the people of the prince</text>
  <text start="138.01" dur="3.509">that shall come that&amp;#39;s very obviously</text>
  <text start="139.959" dur="3.36">talking about the people who follow the</text>
  <text start="141.519" dur="6.321">anti Messiah and the intimacy himself</text>
  <text start="143.319" dur="6.42">which causes major desolation and</text>
  <text start="147.84" dur="6.76">destruction to the city into the holy</text>
  <text start="149.739" dur="8.341">place mmm and then you go on to verse 27</text>
  <text start="154.6" dur="5.76">again verse 27 just like verse 26 starts</text>
  <text start="158.08" dur="5.01">off with Yahshua who confirms the</text>
  <text start="160.36" dur="5.61">covenant with many for one week for 47</text>
  <text start="163.09" dur="5.04">years and then you come to the last half</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="4.769">of that verse which just like verse 26</text>
  <text start="168.13" dur="4.77">talks about the prince that shall come</text>
  <text start="170.739" dur="4.5">the anti Messiah who will cause the</text>
  <text start="172.9" dur="5.58">abomination of desolation in the midst</text>
  <text start="175.239" dur="4.711">of those seven years and the trampling</text>
  <text start="178.48" dur="2.88">of the city and all that stuff the</text>
  <text start="179.95" dur="6.539">abominations that occur for that last</text>
  <text start="181.36" dur="9.36">three and a half years let me just bring</text>
  <text start="186.489" dur="5.731">up a few things to help you see what I</text>
  <text start="190.72" dur="4.73">think these two verses are very clearly</text>
  <text start="192.22" dur="7.739">teaching Satan is the father of lies</text>
  <text start="195.45" dur="7.45">he&amp;#39;s the father of lies so can a father</text>
  <text start="199.959" dur="5.431">of lies confirm a covenant with people I</text>
  <text start="202.9" dur="9.51">mean that&amp;#39;s not very likely a covenant</text>
  <text start="205.39" dur="9.749">is all about a promise and who is the</text>
  <text start="212.41" dur="4.829">one that confirms covenants all through</text>
  <text start="215.139" dur="3.841">Scripture I mean when Adam and Eve</text>
  <text start="217.239" dur="4.291">sinned who confirmed a covenant with</text>
  <text start="218.98" dur="5.159">them it was young he confirm the</text>
  <text start="221.53" dur="5.19">covenant with them who confirmed a</text>
  <text start="224.139" dur="5.19">covenant with Noah he gave us sign the</text>
  <text start="226.72" dur="5.549">sky the rainbow it was yah he confirmed</text>
  <text start="229.329" dur="5.701">a covenant with Noah who confirmed a</text>
  <text start="232.269" dur="5.131">covenant with Abraham and promised</text>
  <text start="235.03" dur="3.989">Abraham this portion of land called</text>
  <text start="237.4" dur="3.919">Israel and that his descendants would be</text>
  <text start="239.019" dur="6.75">as numerous as the stars in the sky and</text>
  <text start="241.319" dur="6.911">the sands in on the on the seashore it</text>
  <text start="245.769" dur="4.941">was yah who confirmed a covenant with</text>
  <text start="248.23" dur="5.66">King David</text>
  <text start="250.71" dur="4.92">yeah he promised that an air of King</text>
  <text start="253.89" dur="3.3">David&amp;#39;s with rule and reign as a king of</text>
  <text start="255.63" dur="3.87">righteousness forever across the earth</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="4.02">and that would be Yahshua yah show</text>
  <text start="259.5" dur="3.78">himself when he walked this earth what</text>
  <text start="261.21" dur="4.11">did he do according to the book of</text>
  <text start="263.28" dur="3.99">Hebrews he confirmed a covenant he</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="4.53">renewed the covenant that was given to</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="5.43">mo che on mount sinai by shedding his</text>
  <text start="269.85" dur="5.61">blood and stamping his Torah through his</text>
  <text start="272.7" dur="5.79">spirit on our hearts and our minds so</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="5.51">it&amp;#39;s yahoo confirms covenants it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="8.25">Satan it&amp;#39;s not the son of perdition and</text>
  <text start="280.97" dur="8.8">in 2010 yah indeed confirmed a covenant</text>
  <text start="286.74" dur="6.45">with many he confirmed the true covenant</text>
  <text start="289.77" dur="7.98">of Sabbath of wind to keep the feast</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="9.36">days in 2010 when the new year actually</text>
  <text start="297.75" dur="7.65">started in april of 2010 not March but</text>
  <text start="302.55" dur="5.04">April there was a sign in the heavens</text>
  <text start="305.4" dur="5.61">and in the earth to confirm when the new</text>
  <text start="307.59" dur="5.81">year began and that sign was the</text>
  <text start="311.01" dur="4.86">eruption of the iceland volcano and</text>
  <text start="313.4" dur="4.15">there was a major meteor that streaked</text>
  <text start="315.87" dur="3.87">across the Midwestern United States</text>
  <text start="317.55" dur="5.76">there&amp;#39;s a sign in the heavens and the</text>
  <text start="319.74" dur="7.68">earth for Passover there was the sign of</text>
  <text start="323.31" dur="7.59">the oil spill the oil disaster that</text>
  <text start="327.42" dur="4.71">happened in the Gulf and literally you</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="4.25">can go through all the feast days in</text>
  <text start="332.13" dur="5.67">2010 when they actually happened and</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="6.04">there were major events that occurred on</text>
  <text start="337.8" dur="6.87">each of those dates so yeah very clearly</text>
  <text start="341.19" dur="6.39">confirmed the Covenant on 2010 with many</text>
  <text start="344.67" dur="4.98">showing when the true calendar is and</text>
  <text start="347.58" dur="4.05">again in 2013 we have this sort of the</text>
  <text start="349.65" dur="3.24">same thing happening you have to</text>
  <text start="351.63" dur="3">understand that this confirmation of the</text>
  <text start="352.89" dur="4.23">Covenant is an ongoing thing it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="354.63" dur="4.32">just a one-time event and so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.12" dur="5.03">continuing to confirm the covenant with</text>
  <text start="358.95" dur="5.25">many to those who have ears to hear</text>
  <text start="362.15" dur="3.22">because if you look at the Feast of</text>
  <text start="364.2" dur="5.25">Trumpets that everyone&amp;#39;s celebrating</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="5.82">this year in September there&amp;#39;s no sign</text>
  <text start="369.45" dur="6.36">in the heavens there&amp;#39;s no interesting</text>
  <text start="371.19" dur="7.8">sign that confirms that but at the end</text>
  <text start="375.81" dur="5.55">of october six there&amp;#39;s a major sign in</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="5.4">the sky for the real feast of trumpets</text>
  <text start="381.36" dur="7.74">yom teruah there&amp;#39;s the woman clothed</text>
  <text start="384.39" dur="7.83">moves with the Sun and she has the moon</text>
  <text start="389.1" dur="4.68">in her feet and Leo the consolation of</text>
  <text start="392.22" dur="3.81">twelve stars is at her head it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="393.78" dur="6.57">sign of Revelation 12 not only that but</text>
  <text start="396.03" dur="6.51">the moon is flanked by mercury which is</text>
  <text start="400.35" dur="4.64">a planet all about the renewed covenant</text>
  <text start="402.54" dur="4.71">coven of the Yahshua made with us and</text>
  <text start="404.99" dur="5.44">Saturn and I have a whole video about</text>
  <text start="407.25" dur="6.63">that called the ceiling of 144,000 the</text>
  <text start="410.43" dur="5.1">countdown to young true of 10 6 2013 so</text>
  <text start="413.88" dur="5.28">again Yahshua is like confirming this</text>
  <text start="415.53" dur="5.01">covenant it&amp;#39;s when to keep the proper</text>
  <text start="419.16" dur="5.24">feast day so you can keep the proper</text>
  <text start="420.54" dur="7.55">high Sabbath that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="424.4" dur="6.91">now one thing I also want to clarify</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="6.64">regarding this video that I made about</text>
  <text start="431.31" dur="6">the ceiling of 144,000 I&amp;#39;m in no way</text>
  <text start="434.73" dur="4.77">advocating or supporting that a satanic</text>
  <text start="437.31" dur="5.67">symbol is going to be stamped on the</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="6.51">foreheads of 144,000 okay but advocating</text>
  <text start="442.98" dur="6.03">that at all all I&amp;#39;m saying is that all</text>
  <text start="446.01" dur="6.77">the signs that are there in the heavens</text>
  <text start="449.01" dur="6.03">lining up with vesa trumpets 10 6 2013</text>
  <text start="452.78" dur="4.45">correlating that with Ezekiel 9 and 10</text>
  <text start="455.04" dur="5.07">in Revelation 7 and 8 i&amp;#39;ll point toward</text>
  <text start="457.23" dur="5.82">that day being the day when the ceiling</text>
  <text start="460.11" dur="5.82">occurs now what is that still going to</text>
  <text start="463.05" dur="5.16">be probably the name of yah on our</text>
  <text start="465.93" dur="3.84">foreheads or it could be the hexagram i</text>
  <text start="468.21" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t know i mean like i explained that</text>
  <text start="469.77" dur="6.75">video Satan is not the one who created</text>
  <text start="473.04" dur="5.4">that shape Satan corrupted it afterward</text>
  <text start="476.52" dur="4.26">but yah was the one who made that shape</text>
  <text start="478.44" dur="8.76">originally so I just wanted to clarify</text>
  <text start="480.78" dur="13.2">that I also want to bring up another</text>
  <text start="487.2" dur="9.75">subject about the 2300 days in daniel</text>
  <text start="493.98" dur="5.34">chapter 8 there are 2300 days that are</text>
  <text start="496.95" dur="3.87">talked about in which the transgression</text>
  <text start="499.32" dur="5.88">of desolation or abomination of</text>
  <text start="500.82" dur="6.48">desolation the sacrifices and the</text>
  <text start="505.2" dur="5.28">trampling underfoot of the of the city</text>
  <text start="507.3" dur="6.45">takes place and of course to know from</text>
  <text start="510.48" dur="6.15">revelation 11 to that that trampling of</text>
  <text start="513.75" dur="5.409">the city takes 42 months</text>
  <text start="516.63" dur="6.82">now I believe that Yahshua is returning</text>
  <text start="519.159" dur="6.571">for his bride on yom teruah 2017 and you</text>
  <text start="523.45" dur="6.96">can read all about that he&amp;#39;ll my on my</text>
  <text start="525.73" dur="7.799">website if you go 2300 days back from</text>
  <text start="530.41" dur="6.75">Yom through 2017 you come to june fifth</text>
  <text start="533.529" dur="7.701">2011 now in june fifth 2011 something</text>
  <text start="537.16" dur="6.45">very very amazing occurred basically</text>
  <text start="541.23" dur="5.049">what you had happen was for the first</text>
  <text start="543.61" dur="5.19">time in 38 years basically for the first</text>
  <text start="546.279" dur="4.68">time ever since the Yom Kippur War 1973</text>
  <text start="548.8" dur="5.58">you had open hostilities break out</text>
  <text start="550.959" dur="4.851">between Syria and Israel and i believe</text>
  <text start="554.38" dur="5.43">it was those events that occurred on</text>
  <text start="555.81" dur="8.58">june fifth 2011 again exactly 2300 days</text>
  <text start="559.81" dur="9.149">before yom teruah 2017 but those events</text>
  <text start="564.39" dur="6.33">will lead to the rest of the events the</text>
  <text start="568.959" dur="4.171">the abomination of desolation the</text>
  <text start="570.72" dur="4.54">transgression of desolation the</text>
  <text start="573.13" dur="5.37">trampling of the city underfoot and of</text>
  <text start="575.26" dur="5.91">course the return of Yahshua now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="578.5" dur="6.18">interesting is we&amp;#39;re coming up to</text>
  <text start="581.17" dur="8.72">October 6 2013 which is the 40-year</text>
  <text start="584.68" dur="7.89">anniversary of the yom kippur war now</text>
  <text start="589.89" dur="5.23">although this time october six is not</text>
  <text start="592.57" dur="5.91">yom kippur like it was in 1973 this time</text>
  <text start="595.12" dur="4.77">october six is yom teruah there&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="598.48" dur="3.62">difference between yom kippur annual</text>
