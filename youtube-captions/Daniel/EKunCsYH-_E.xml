  <text start="61.14" dur="5.4">book of revelation and prophecy and</text>
  <text start="63.75" dur="4.2">what&amp;#39;s going to unfold but the thing</text>
  <text start="66.54" dur="3.48">that has happened with modern</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="3.75">Christianity is Christianity has become</text>
  <text start="70.02" dur="5.07">divorced from their Hebrew Jewish roots</text>
  <text start="71.7" dur="5.34">when you observe and obey and keep the</text>
  <text start="75.09" dur="4.2">Hebrew feast days as talked about</text>
  <text start="77.04" dur="4.14">Leviticus 23 these are the very feast</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="4.23">days that Jesus celebrated in the</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="4.02">Christian Gospels you know Passover</text>

  <text start="95.1" dur="3.809">you obey and observe these very same</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="5.1">feasts that Jesus Christ Himself</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="5.941">observed in unlocks prophecy and it</text>
  <text start="102.45" dur="3.51">makes prophecy all these things it seems</text>
  <text start="104.85" dur="2.97">so hard to understand it makes</text>
  <text start="105.96" dur="3.869">prophecies very clear it brings clarity</text>
  <text start="107.82" dur="3.45">so before we get into the prophetic</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="3.271">teaching I just want to go over and now</text>
  <text start="111.27" dur="3.51">that we&amp;#39;ve finished the fall feast</text>
  <text start="113.1" dur="3.839">season I just want to go over real</text>
  <text start="114.78" dur="3.659">quickly what a lot of you probably know</text>
  <text start="116.939" dur="2.761">if you&amp;#39;ve watched this channel for any</text>
  <text start="118.439" dur="3.901">period of time but it&amp;#39;s always good to</text>
  <text start="119.7" dur="4.949">do a review so when we talk about the</text>
  <text start="122.34" dur="5.66">feast days in the early spring we always</text>
  <text start="124.649" dur="5.481">have what starts off beepy season which</text>
  <text start="128" dur="4.17">Passover this always happens anywhere</text>
  <text start="130.13" dur="4.23">from early to late April depending on</text>
  <text start="132.17" dur="4.89">the year Passover of course was</text>
  <text start="134.36" dur="5.82">fulfilled when Jesus was murdered on the</text>
  <text start="137.06" dur="5.79">cross he was sacrificed as the Passover</text>
  <text start="140.18" dur="4.83">lamb on Passover 2,000 years ago and</text>
  <text start="142.85" dur="3.93">when we celebrate Passover we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="145.01" dur="4.62">it as a memorial looking back on what</text>
  <text start="146.78" dur="4.68">Jesus did and then of course that kicks</text>
  <text start="149.63" dur="4.38">off the seven days of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="151.46" dur="5.16">for seven days you don&amp;#39;t eat any bread</text>
  <text start="154.01" dur="5.43">with leaven and this of course is when</text>
  <text start="156.62" dur="5.19">Jesus was buried he was buried on</text>
  <text start="159.44" dur="3.69">unleavened bread he was buried in the</text>
  <text start="161.81" dur="3.78">heart of the earth for three days and</text>
  <text start="163.13" dur="6.15">three nights in the Sepulcher right up</text>
  <text start="165.59" dur="6.09">there on the skull skull Mountain which</text>
  <text start="169.28" dur="4.62">was a part of the Mount of Olives where</text>
  <text start="171.68" dur="3.54">he was crucified and he was buried on</text>
  <text start="173.9" dur="3.51">unleavened bread so he fulfilled</text>
  <text start="175.22" dur="4.68">unleavened bread and then of course on</text>
  <text start="177.41" dur="4.17">the feast of firstfruits which happened</text>
  <text start="179.9" dur="3.63">exactly three days and three nights</text>
  <text start="181.58" dur="4.53">later after Passover that year</text>
  <text start="183.53" dur="5.52">firstfruits Jesus rose as the first</text>
  <text start="186.11" dur="5.31">fruit from among the dead and He</text>
  <text start="189.05" dur="6.63">fulfilled this and we celebrate this</text>
  <text start="191.42" dur="6.15">these feasts every early spring to</text>
  <text start="195.68" dur="4.5">remind ourselves of what Jesus did and</text>
  <text start="197.57" dur="4.44">then of course fifty days after first</text>
  <text start="200.18" dur="3.809">fruits you come to late spring this</text>
  <text start="202.01" dur="4.11">usually happens anywhere from late May</text>
  <text start="203.989" dur="3.661">to late June depending on the year you</text>
  <text start="206.12" dur="4.11">have what&amp;#39;s known as Pentecost or</text>
  <text start="207.65" dur="5.97">Chapleau and Pentecost is when Jesus</text>
  <text start="210.23" dur="5.46">poured out his Holy Spirit he couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="213.62" dur="4.589">pour it out in mass until he had</text>
  <text start="215.69" dur="4.98">ascended had been glorified but once he</text>
  <text start="218.209" dur="4.441">you know he went up to heaven ten days</text>
  <text start="220.67" dur="4.53">before Pentecost that year 2,000 years</text>
  <text start="222.65" dur="3.839">ago and so then Pentecost was fulfilled</text>
  <text start="225.2" dur="3.21">the Holy Spirit being poured out which</text>
  <text start="226.489" dur="4.051">enables us to have that inner desire to</text>
  <text start="228.41" dur="4.95">obey His commandments the statutes his</text>
  <text start="230.54" dur="4.44">Torah and so again we celebrate all</text>
  <text start="233.36" dur="3.33">these spring feasts Passover unleavened</text>
  <text start="234.98" dur="4.86">bread first fruits of Pentecost every</text>
  <text start="236.69" dur="6.93">year as a memorial looking back on what</text>
  <text start="239.84" dur="5.31">Jesus did now then we go to the fall</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="3.3">feasts every year in the fall feasts</text>
  <text start="245.15" dur="3.6">even though Jesus has fulfilled these</text>
  <text start="246.92" dur="4.349">spring feasts he has not yet fulfilled</text>
  <text start="248.75" dur="4.41">the fall feasts he&amp;#39;s come as the</text>
  <text start="251.269" dur="4.591">suffering servant talked about in Isaiah</text>
  <text start="253.16" dur="3.169">53 and Psalm 22 but he&amp;#39;s not yet come as</text>
  <text start="255.86" dur="2.54">the calm</text>
  <text start="256.329" dur="4.8">during king like he&amp;#39;s talking about in</text>
  <text start="258.4" dur="4.38">Psalm chapter 2 in Zechariah 14 so</text>
  <text start="261.129" dur="3.241">that&amp;#39;s what the fall feast for about so</text>
  <text start="262.78" dur="3.419">every year of course we kick off the</text>
  <text start="264.37" dur="4.74">fall feast season again this happens</text>
  <text start="266.199" dur="4.77">anywhere from late September to to</text>
  <text start="269.11" dur="3.57">October or left rubber depending on the</text>
  <text start="270.969" dur="4.021">air but you have the Feast of Trumpets</text>
  <text start="272.68" dur="4.489">and the Feast of Trumpets of course has</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="5.01">not been fulfilled because this is what</text>
  <text start="277.169" dur="4.571">when that when that peace is fulfilled</text>
  <text start="280" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s when that last seventh trumpet</text>
  <text start="281.74" dur="4.35">blows in the book of Revelation where</text>
  <text start="283.9" dur="3.569">Paul talks about the dead Messiah ranks</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="4.02">first and we who are alive and remain</text>
  <text start="287.469" dur="4.17">get get transformed into our resurrected</text>
  <text start="290.11" dur="4.589">bodies we get caught up to be with them</text>
  <text start="291.639" dur="4.321">and we meet Jesus in the clouds so that</text>
  <text start="294.699" dur="3.331">is not you have the Christians often</text>
  <text start="295.96" dur="3.989">call it the rapture I don&amp;#39;t like to use</text>
  <text start="298.03" dur="3.81">that terminology because technically</text>
  <text start="299.949" dur="3.481">it&amp;#39;s the seventh trumpet resurrection</text>
  <text start="301.84" dur="3.27">it&amp;#39;s blessed it is huge part of this</text>
  <text start="303.43" dur="2.91">first resurrection so that&amp;#39;s what Feast</text>
  <text start="305.11" dur="3.54">of Trumpets is all about it&amp;#39;s looking</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="4.919">forward to our future resurrection where</text>
  <text start="308.65" dur="4.71">we meet Jesus in the clouds that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="311.259" dur="3.87">next one on the timeline to be fulfilled</text>
  <text start="313.36" dur="4.529">it does not get them fulfilled yet it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="315.129" dur="4.32">be fulfilled in some future year around</text>
  <text start="317.889" dur="3.661">the season of the Feast of Trumpets</text>
  <text start="319.449" dur="3.75">then ten days later every year you have</text>
  <text start="321.55" dur="4.169">what&amp;#39;s known as Yom Kippur this is the</text>
  <text start="323.199" dur="4.411">fast day you know where you fast from</text>
  <text start="325.719" dur="3.781">food and water from the ninth Dave</text>
  <text start="327.61" dur="3.419">you&amp;#39;ve been to the tenth David and Yom</text>
  <text start="329.5" dur="3.509">Kippur looks forward to that day when</text>
  <text start="331.029" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re you know we&amp;#39;ve been resurrected we</text>
  <text start="333.009" dur="3.991">get caught up to do Jesus in the clouds</text>
  <text start="334.659" dur="3.841">and then revelation talks about how when</text>
  <text start="337" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;re in our resurrected bodies we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="338.5" dur="4.949">standing on the sea of fire and glass in</text>
  <text start="340.75" dur="3.96">heaven and Jesus gives us our rewards so</text>
  <text start="343.449" dur="3.301">this is when we got our rewards and</text>
  <text start="344.71" dur="4.769">that&amp;#39;s just the first fulfillment of Yom</text>
  <text start="346.75" dur="4.169">Kippur the ultimate fulfillment of Yom</text>
  <text start="349.479" dur="3.271">Kippur happens a thousand years later</text>
  <text start="350.919" dur="4.021">after the Millennial Kingdom at the</text>
  <text start="352.75" dur="3.9">great white throne judgment when all the</text>
  <text start="354.94" dur="3.899">wicked are resurrected and cast like a</text>
  <text start="356.65" dur="4.109">fire there&amp;#39;s a final end all iniquity</text>
  <text start="358.839" dur="3.811">and sin so this is just the first</text>
  <text start="360.759" dur="4.71">fulfilling Kippur when we stand on that</text>
  <text start="362.65" dur="4.35">sea of fire and glass ten days after</text>
  <text start="365.469" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;ve been resurrected and we meet Jesus</text>
  <text start="367" dur="4.379">in the clouds and then five days after</text>
  <text start="369.789" dur="3.63">you before you have the seven-day week</text>
  <text start="371.379" dur="4.021">wedding feast which is to code where you</text>
  <text start="373.419" dur="4.081">live in the Sukkos or temporary dwelling</text>
  <text start="375.4" dur="2.6">places it&amp;#39;s seven days of living in</text>
  <text start="377.5" dur="2.03">essica</text>
  <text start="378" dur="4.2">and the only eight-day the last great</text>
  <text start="379.53" dur="4.5">day you come out of that so you have to</text>
  <text start="382.2" dur="4.05">coat which is seven days and then you</text>
  <text start="384.03" dur="4.89">have the eighth day or the last great</text>
  <text start="386.25" dur="4.68">day and that has not yet been filled</text>
  <text start="388.92" dur="2.91">either because Sukkot is the wedding</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="3.81">feast of the Lamb</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="5.04">so trumpets we get caught up to view</text>
  <text start="394.74" dur="4.11">Jesus in the clown&amp;#39;s ten days later</text>
  <text start="396.87" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re standing on that sea of fire and</text>
  <text start="398.85" dur="3.9">glass in heaven where Jesus gives us our</text>
  <text start="400.95" dur="4.02">rewards based on what we&amp;#39;ve done on</text>
  <text start="402.75" dur="3.87">earth and then five days therefore that</text>
  <text start="404.97" dur="3.42">we have the wedding supper of the Lamb</text>
  <text start="406.62" dur="4.29">which in Revelation 19 it talks about</text>
  <text start="408.39" dur="4.32">blessed is he who is invited to the</text>
  <text start="410.91" dur="4.53">wedding supper of the Lamb so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="412.71" dur="4.5">what Sukkot is when it&amp;#39;s well initially</text>
  <text start="415.44" dur="5.7">fulfilled I should say is that the</text>
  <text start="417.21" dur="5.91">wedding supper of the Lamb up in heaven</text>
  <text start="421.14" dur="4.68">and then the last great day the eighth</text>
  <text start="423.12" dur="5.61">day is when Jesus kicks back his charity</text>
  <text start="425.82" dur="5.28">stands up and he says okay guys we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="428.73" dur="4.74">had our wedding feast now it&amp;#39;s time to</text>
  <text start="431.1" dur="4.58">go back and take back here and so that</text>
  <text start="433.47" dur="5.67">on that last great day the eighth day</text>
  <text start="435.68" dur="5.08">Yahshua and all the angelic hosts and we</text>
  <text start="439.14" dur="3.27">who have been resurrected and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="440.76" dur="4.62">like the angels we get on our flying</text>
  <text start="442.41" dur="5.61">horses and and and Yahshua rips rips</text>
  <text start="445.38" dur="4.26">open the eastern sky and he descends</text>
  <text start="448.02" dur="3.63">down to earth toward Mount Olives as it</text>
  <text start="449.64" dur="4.56">talks about Zechariah 14 in Revelation</text>
  <text start="451.65" dur="3.75">19 and with the with the brightness of</text>
  <text start="454.2" dur="3.9">his coming in the breadth of his mouth</text>
  <text start="455.4" dur="4.92">he destroys the son of perdition the</text>
  <text start="458.1" dur="4.68">Beast the false prophet cast them into</text>
  <text start="460.32" dur="3.659">lake of fire he destroys all those who</text>

  <text start="463.979" dur="5.521">coming up against Jerusalem and he</text>
  <text start="466.11" dur="4.92">establishes his 1000 year Kingdom and so</text>
  <text start="469.5" dur="2.97">for a thousand years he&amp;#39;s ruling and</text>
  <text start="471.03" dur="3.24">reigning while Satan and all of his</text>
  <text start="472.47" dur="3.66">fallen angels are bound in the heart of</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="3.72">the earth and he&amp;#39;s ruling and reigning</text>

  <text start="479.61" dur="3.57">and reigning with them and all those who</text>
  <text start="481.11" dur="3.869">survived the tribulation that did not</text>
  <text start="483.18" dur="3.6">take the mark of the beast but did not</text>
  <text start="484.979" dur="3.901">make the seventh trumpet resurrection</text>
  <text start="486.78" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re mortals and they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="488.88" dur="3.45">babies and children and it you know</text>
  <text start="490.8" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re under a perfect government for a</text>
  <text start="492.33" dur="3.57">thousand years and it says all nations</text>
  <text start="494.52" dur="2.73">will be commanded to come up to</text>
  <text start="495.9" dur="3.45">Jerusalem to keep the feast of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="497.25" dur="4.47">and if they do not there&amp;#39;ll be no rain</text>
  <text start="499.35" dur="4.05">and it says anyone who dies who&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="501.72" dur="3.33">mortal who dies during that time</text>
  <text start="503.4" dur="3.989">100 years old it&amp;#39;ll be considered a</text>
  <text start="505.05" dur="3.99">young death so for a thousand years</text>
  <text start="507.389" dur="3.211">there&amp;#39;s no war there&amp;#39;s a perfect</text>
  <text start="509.04" dur="3.42">government Jesus is ruling and reigning</text>
  <text start="510.6" dur="4.83">on his throne we&amp;#39;re ruling and reigning</text>
  <text start="512.46" dur="4.98">with him and the population of the earth</text>
  <text start="515.43" dur="3.96">is multiplying so for a thousand years</text>
  <text start="517.44" dur="3.12">of peace you probably have now at the</text>
  <text start="519.39" dur="3.209">end of that thousand years you have</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="3.87">trillions upon trillions of people and</text>

  <text start="622.56" dur="3.6">fullness of who he is it&amp;#39;s beyond our</text>
  <text start="624.54" dur="4.5">compression so these are the feast days</text>
  <text start="626.16" dur="5.549">that we keep every year and they help to</text>
  <text start="629.04" dur="5.039">unlock prophecy and how prophecy unfolds</text>
  <text start="631.709" dur="4.321">in the book of Revelation so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.079" dur="4.441">very important to continue this is white</text>
  <text start="636.03" dur="5.34">says in the New Testament in Colossians</text>
  <text start="638.52" dur="4.5">2 says these are these feast days are a</text>
  <text start="641.37" dur="3.51">shadow of things to come</text>
  <text start="643.02" dur="4.41">he said that 30 years after the</text>
  <text start="644.88" dur="5.1">resurrection so even Apostle Paul the</text>
  <text start="647.43" dur="4.14">author of most of the New Testament says</text>
  <text start="649.98" dur="2.94">that these feast days we should be</text>
  <text start="651.57" dur="3.39">obeying and observing because they</text>
  <text start="652.92" dur="5.16">continue to point toward things that</text>
  <text start="654.96" dur="4.62">have not yet been fulfilled now there</text>
  <text start="658.08" dur="3.63">were two other feasts that were added</text>
  <text start="659.58" dur="3.87">after a little bit against 23 it was</text>
  <text start="661.71" dur="5.49">Purim which is talking about in the book</text>
  <text start="663.45" dur="5.07">of Esther Esther in every Bible perm is</text>
  <text start="667.2" dur="3.36">a two-day feast that happens in late</text>
  <text start="668.52" dur="5.7">winter and there&amp;#39;s Hanukkah Hanukkah is</text>
  <text start="670.56" dur="5.61">a an eight-day feast sort of an echo of</text>
  <text start="674.22" dur="5.18">Sukkot and Hanukkah usually happens</text>
  <text start="676.17" dur="6.24">anytime from mid December to early</text>
  <text start="679.4" dur="4.81">January depending on the year and Purim</text>
  <text start="682.41" dur="4.71">and Hanukkah are also very important</text>
  <text start="684.21" dur="5.52">Purim he&amp;#39;s very interesting it always</text>
  <text start="687.12" dur="4.2">happens in the late winter and Jesus</text>
  <text start="689.73" dur="6.17">said something very interesting about</text>
  <text start="691.32" dur="7.95">Purim he said that pray that your your</text>
  <text start="695.9" dur="5.29">feast or your Sabbath excuse me pray</text>
  <text start="699.27" dur="5.16">that the Great Tribulation does not</text>
  <text start="701.19" dur="5.57">begin on a Sabbath because when it does</text>
  <text start="704.43" dur="4.32">Great Tribulation will happen and</text>
  <text start="706.76" dur="3.34">actually he says pray that it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="708.75" dur="3.48">happen in winter or on the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="710.1" dur="4.59">because when it does Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="712.23" dur="3.93">will happen so he gets rid of a marker</text>
  <text start="714.69" dur="3.54">and a key and he want a warning that</text>
  <text start="716.16" dur="5.37">says that this Great Tribulation that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="718.23" dur="6.03">three and a half year 42 months 1260 12</text>
  <text start="721.53" dur="4.95">90-day period that&amp;#39;s talked about over</text>
  <text start="724.26" dur="4.65">and over in the book of Revelation that</text>
  <text start="726.48" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s going to start on Purim because</text>
  <text start="728.91" dur="4.86">perm is the only feast day that can</text>
  <text start="730.5" dur="4.89">happen on a Saturday a Sabbath and in</text>
  <text start="733.77" dur="4.05">the winter</text>
  <text start="735.39" dur="4.68">now Purim is a two-day feast and it can</text>
  <text start="737.82" dur="4.44">happen on any two days like this next</text>
  <text start="740.07" dur="4.14">year in 2020 it will happen on Sunday</text>
  <text start="742.26" dur="3.29">and Monday and this year it happened on</text>
  <text start="744.21" dur="4.95">I think it was a Wednesday into Thursday</text>
  <text start="745.55" dur="5.56">but some future year when perm actually</text>
  <text start="749.16" dur="5.64">falls when one of those days falls on a</text>
  <text start="751.11" dur="5.25">Saturday a weekly Sabbath then we have</text>
  <text start="754.8" dur="3.69">to pay attention because whenever it</text>
  <text start="756.36" dur="3.54">falls on a Sabbath in the late winter</text>
  <text start="758.49" dur="3.03">that&amp;#39;s a potential</text>
  <text start="759.9" dur="3.99">time that the great tribulations could</text>
  <text start="761.52" dur="4.8">start based on Jesus&amp;#39;s own words when he</text>
  <text start="763.89" dur="4.17">said pray that your flight does not</text>
  <text start="766.32" dur="3.81">happen in winter or on the Sabbath for</text>
  <text start="768.06" dur="4.14">when it does Great Tribulation happens</text>
  <text start="770.13" dur="3.72">so Purim which is all about Haman and</text>
  <text start="772.2" dur="3.99">the end he&amp;#39;s a portion of the Antichrist</text>
  <text start="773.85" dur="4.11">and Esther and Mordecai overcome him</text>
  <text start="776.19" dur="3.21">it&amp;#39;s all about the Antichrist the son of</text>
  <text start="777.96" dur="3.96">perdition so firm is very key and</text>
  <text start="779.4" dur="3.84">understanding the beginning events of</text>
  <text start="781.92" dur="3.57">the three-and-a-half year Great</text>
  <text start="783.24" dur="4.62">Tribulation and then Hanukkah which is</text>
  <text start="785.49" dur="5.3">all about rededicating yourself to yah</text>
  <text start="787.86" dur="5.25">Jesus celebrated Hanukkah and John 10:22</text>
  <text start="790.79" dur="4.3">Hanukkah is rededicating that temple</text>
  <text start="793.11" dur="4.47">overcoming impossible odds Hanukkah is</text>
  <text start="795.09" dur="4.74">all about when Jesus Christ himself when</text>
  <text start="797.58" dur="3.93">he returns to the earth you know he sets</text>
  <text start="799.83" dur="3.99">down on Mount olives with all of us in</text>
  <text start="801.51" dur="4.05">Zechariah 14 he rules and reigns 4000</text>
  <text start="803.82" dur="3.48">years that&amp;#39;s when he rededicate his</text>
  <text start="805.56" dur="3.75">temple the Millennial temple there will</text>
  <text start="807.3" dur="4.47">be a temple during the thousand years</text>
  <text start="809.31" dur="4.71">and Jesus Reed dedicates that temple</text>
  <text start="811.77" dur="4.23">during Hanukkah so these are all very</text>
  <text start="814.02" dur="5.58">important things our remember as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="816" dur="4.68">unlocking prophecy now the first thing I</text>
  <text start="819.6" dur="2.91">want to deal with is there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="820.68" dur="3.78">misconception that we have a seven-year</text>
  <text start="822.51" dur="4.17">tribulation that&amp;#39;s not anywhere in the</text>
  <text start="824.46" dur="5.1">Bible the seven years were found in</text>
  <text start="826.68" dur="4.92">Daniel chapter 9 but if you notice by</text>
  <text start="829.56" dur="4.02">the time you get past the Gospels and</text>
  <text start="831.6" dur="4.05">into the book of Revelation there is no</text>
  <text start="833.58" dur="5.37">mention of seven years you read</text>
  <text start="835.65" dur="5.43">revelation from front to back and it</text>
  <text start="838.95" dur="4.74">mentions three and a half years time</text>
  <text start="841.08" dur="4.86">times and half a time it mentions 1260</text>
  <text start="843.69" dur="3.99">days it mentions 42 months it mentions</text>
  <text start="845.94" dur="2.91">this three-and-a-half year period but it</text>
  <text start="847.68" dur="3.05">never mentions the whole seven-year</text>
  <text start="848.85" dur="6.03">period and there&amp;#39;s a reason for that</text>
  <text start="850.73" dur="6.22">Daniel talks about seven full years and</text>
  <text start="854.88" dur="4.44">he says if the Messiah is cut off in the</text>
  <text start="856.95" dur="4.2">midst and this is because Jesus Christ</text>
  <text start="859.32" dur="5.85">fulfilled the first three and a half</text>
  <text start="861.15" dur="6.42">years of that seven-year period so Jesus</text>
  <text start="865.17" dur="4.89">started a ministry that lasted exactly</text>
  <text start="867.57" dur="3.99">three and a half years and this can be</text>
  <text start="870.06" dur="4.05">proven through the chronology of the</text>
  <text start="871.56" dur="4.59">Gospels I know Michael Rood says it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="874.11" dur="2.67">seventy weeks but he&amp;#39;s completely in</text>
  <text start="876.15" dur="3.24">error</text>
  <text start="876.78" dur="4.26">and he&amp;#39;s falling satanic lying spirits</text>
  <text start="879.39" dur="3.33">because he&amp;#39;s made merchandise of the</text>
  <text start="881.04" dur="4.26">gospel he sells all of his stuff which</text>
  <text start="882.72" dur="5.28">is evil so he&amp;#39;s gotten off of the</text>
  <text start="885.3" dur="4.69">deception he follows heaven Gordon the</text>
  <text start="888" dur="4.3">Care Act who denies Messiah said almost</text>
  <text start="889.99" dur="3.599">my career but Jesus Christ ministry is</text>
  <text start="892.3" dur="4.02">three and a half years long and he</text>
  <text start="893.589" dur="4.051">fulfills that seven-year week the first</text>
  <text start="896.32" dur="2.97">three nine years where he&amp;#39;s cut off in</text>
  <text start="897.64" dur="2.759">the midst of it and of course he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="899.29" dur="2.46">resurrected three days and three nights</text>
  <text start="900.399" dur="4.801">later so that first three and a half</text>
  <text start="901.75" dur="6.33">years was fulfilled 2,000 years ago and</text>
  <text start="905.2" dur="6.87">then the prophetic clock stopped it</text>
  <text start="908.08" dur="6.27">stopped once Jesus resurrected and he</text>
  <text start="912.07" dur="3.87">walked with the disciples for 40 days</text>
  <text start="914.35" dur="5.609">and 40 nights and his resurrected body</text>
  <text start="915.94" dur="5.58">and then he ascended up ten days before</text>
  <text start="919.959" dur="4.561">Pentecost and the Holy Spirit was poured</text>
  <text start="921.52" dur="4.259">out that prophetic clock stops to the</text>
  <text start="924.52" dur="3.48">three and a half years of the first</text>
  <text start="925.779" dur="5.43">seven years were stopping and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="928" dur="4.47">living in a 2,000 year pause for the</text>
  <text start="931.209" dur="3.771">time of the Gentiles to bring the</text>
  <text start="932.47" dur="4.92">Gentiles into the Commonwealth of Israel</text>
  <text start="934.98" dur="4.359">so the final three and a half years of</text>
  <text start="937.39" dur="4.71">that seven-year week has yet to be</text>
  <text start="939.339" dur="4.411">fulfilled so we don&amp;#39;t have a seven-year</text>
  <text start="942.1" dur="3.39">tribulation that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="943.75" dur="6.149">awaiting us we have three and a half</text>
  <text start="945.49" dur="6.33">years 42 months 1260 1290 these are</text>
  <text start="949.899" dur="4.051">mentioned all through revelation and</text>
  <text start="951.82" dur="4.139">even in the Book of Daniel as well in</text>
  <text start="953.95" dur="5.129">fact we have quite a few different time</text>
  <text start="955.959" dur="4.951">periods we have in Daniel it&amp;#39;s seven or</text>
  <text start="959.079" dur="5.311">eight when it talks about the time of</text>
  <text start="960.91" dur="4.98">the sacrifices the temples sacrifices</text>
  <text start="964.39" dur="4.05">and then it being stopped and then the</text>
  <text start="965.89" dur="8.61">tribulation that whole time period is</text>
  <text start="968.44" dur="9.149">exactly 2300 days which is about 6.8</text>
  <text start="974.5" dur="5.97">years so there is a 2300 days and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="977.589" dur="4.701">gonna talk about that also if you go to</text>
  <text start="980.47" dur="6.679">the Book of Daniel you read about the</text>
  <text start="982.29" dur="10.21">1335 days blessed is he who gets to the</text>
  <text start="987.149" dur="7.211">1330 fifth day you also have a 1290 days</text>
  <text start="992.5" dur="5.19">which is the abomination of desolation</text>
  <text start="994.36" dur="7.38">time period and then you have the 1260</text>
  <text start="997.69" dur="6.149">days which is not only mentioned in</text>
  <text start="1001.74" dur="5.28">Revelation or in Daniel but all through</text>
  <text start="1003.839" dur="4.74">revelation at the woman in revelation 12</text>

  <text start="1010.89" dur="6.689">witnesses are preaching for exactly two</text>
  <text start="1014.39" dur="4.569">1260 days so of all these timeframes and</text>
  <text start="1017.579" dur="2.081">all of these timeframes can only be</text>
  <text start="1018.959" dur="2.891">understood</text>

  <text start="1029.74" dur="5.31">like Jesus Yahshua our master and</text>

  <text start="1037.33" dur="6.36">days I want to talk about President</text>

  <text start="1331.75" dur="7.5">we&amp;#39;re seeing all that get taken down now</text>
  <text start="1334.38" dur="16.02">when we get to 2024 that that cliff that</text>
  <text start="1339.25" dur="15.09">solar eclipse happens on April April 8th</text>
  <text start="1350.4" dur="8.05">2024 and now we&amp;#39;re gonna start exploring</text>
  <text start="1354.34" dur="6.27">these 2300 days 1335 days 1290 1260 days</text>
  <text start="1358.45" dur="4.109">that are talked about in Daniel chapter</text>
  <text start="1360.61" dur="3.09">8 you know 12 throughout the book of</text>
  <text start="1362.559" dur="2.761">Revelation we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about all</text>
  <text start="1363.7" dur="5.07">these dates and how they fit in how I</text>
  <text start="1365.32" dur="5.94">believe they fit in to prophecy now</text>
  <text start="1368.77" dur="4.89">again I understand that I could be wrong</text>
  <text start="1371.26" dur="4.89">with my dates although I do believe that</text>
  <text start="1373.66" dur="4.59">the way things are gonna unfold it is</text>
  <text start="1376.15" dur="4.46">gonna happen at some point maybe not</text>
  <text start="1378.25" dur="4.95">necessarily on the dates that I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="1380.61" dur="4.06">but I&amp;#39;m gonna use the following dates as</text>
  <text start="1383.2" dur="6.62">a template to kind of give an example of</text>
  <text start="1384.67" dur="7.71">how this would unfold so first of all</text>
  <text start="1389.82" dur="5.95">you know Trump&amp;#39;s gonna get reelected in</text>
  <text start="1392.38" dur="7.62">a massive landslide in 2020 and then</text>
  <text start="1395.77" dur="9.09">when we get to the year 2021 Pentecost</text>
  <text start="1400" dur="8.25">that year happens on June 13th</text>
  <text start="1404.86" dur="6.419">June 13th of 2021 we have the day of</text>
  <text start="1408.25" dur="5.97">Pentecost and the very next day June</text>
  <text start="1411.279" dur="5.49">14th which happens to be of course our</text>
  <text start="1414.22" dur="7.86">president&amp;#39;s birthday that would kick off</text>
  <text start="1416.769" dur="7.741">the 2300 days so from June 14 2021 all</text>
  <text start="1422.08" dur="7.349">the way until yom teruah which is gonna</text>
  <text start="1424.51" dur="8.73">be October 1st 2027 you have 2300 days</text>
  <text start="1429.429" dur="5.25">and so if my timeline is correct not</text>
  <text start="1433.24" dur="4.439">only will the president Trump be</text>
  <text start="1434.679" dur="7.47">reelected in the fall of 2020 but by</text>
  <text start="1437.679" dur="7.321">June 14th of 2021 you&amp;#39;re gonna have a</text>
  <text start="1442.149" dur="5.041">full temple rebuilt in Jerusalem and</text>
  <text start="1445" dur="5.76">that those animal sacrifices are gonna</text>
  <text start="1447.19" dur="5.79">begin starting right as a Pentecost ends</text>
  <text start="1450.76" dur="6.12">in June of 2021 which will kick off the</text>
  <text start="1452.98" dur="5.6">2300 days so if I&amp;#39;m correct we&amp;#39;ll know</text>
  <text start="1456.88" dur="4.08">because by 2021</text>
  <text start="1458.58" dur="4.449">we should have a temple in place in</text>
  <text start="1460.96" dur="4.53">Jerusalem and animal sacrifice is being</text>
  <text start="1463.029" dur="4.201">done at that temple by the Zionist Jews</text>
  <text start="1465.49" dur="3.75">now again this temple is going to be</text>
  <text start="1467.23" dur="4.439">controlled by Jews who are into Kabbalah</text>
  <text start="1469.24" dur="5.22">into the Talmud which the Talmud</text>
  <text start="1471.669" dur="4.62">sanctions child sex so we should have</text>
  <text start="1474.46" dur="4.14">nothing to do with this temple there</text>
  <text start="1476.289" dur="3.931">will be a true pure temple during the</text>
  <text start="1478.6" dur="3.36">1000 year reign of Messiah but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1480.22" dur="3.569">after the seventh trumpet resurrection</text>
  <text start="1481.96" dur="2.849">and after the Great Tribulation so we</text>
  <text start="1483.789" dur="4.531">should have nothing to do with this</text>
  <text start="1484.809" dur="4.83">temple but you know but but if I&amp;#39;m right</text>
  <text start="1488.32" dur="3.15">it should happen in 2021</text>
  <text start="1489.639" dur="3.65">now kick-off the 2300 days which will</text>
  <text start="1491.47" dur="5.64">terminate on the Feast of Trumpets</text>
  <text start="1493.289" dur="7.781">October 1st 2027 which is exactly 2,300</text>
  <text start="1497.11" dur="9.299">days at the end of talks about now when</text>
  <text start="1501.07" dur="9.329">you skip forward to 2024 you first of</text>
  <text start="1506.409" dur="11.071">all in 2024 so a few years later after</text>
  <text start="1510.399" dur="10.65">2021 2024 April 8th is when that second</text>
  <text start="1517.48" dur="5.22">solar eclipse occurs that does the x</text>
  <text start="1521.049" dur="3.48">marks the spot and what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="1522.7" dur="6.63">about that is that exactly two days</text>
  <text start="1524.529" dur="8.311">later on April 10th that&amp;#39;s the beginning</text>
  <text start="1529.33" dur="6.93">of the Hebrew New Year that year now the</text>
  <text start="1532.84" dur="5.46">Jews will start that year a month early</text>
  <text start="1536.26" dur="5.14">because they follow this</text>
  <text start="1538.3" dur="5.26">pre-calculated Hallel to calendar or</text>
  <text start="1541.4" dur="3.21">they don&amp;#39;t follow the scriptures and so</text>
  <text start="1543.56" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re actually going to start their</text>
  <text start="1544.61" dur="5.58">gear a month earlier in March which is</text>
  <text start="1548.06" dur="4.34">key to why this thing&amp;#39;s going to unfold</text>
  <text start="1550.19" dur="7.08">and I believe 2024</text>
  <text start="1552.4" dur="7.42">so April 10th is the new year and before</text>
  <text start="1557.27" dur="5.55">we get to the new year in April remember</text>
  <text start="1559.82" dur="3.78">we have Purim in 2024 so we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1562.82" dur="6.24">go backwards</text>
  <text start="1563.6" dur="7.38">it&amp;#39;s a February 24th of 2024 which</text>
  <text start="1569.06" dur="3.63">happens to be a Saturday happens to be a</text>
  <text start="1570.98" dur="6.02">weekly Shabbat it&amp;#39;s in the winter and</text>
  <text start="1572.69" dur="6.99">that is the first day of Purim that year</text>
  <text start="1577" dur="4.93">now remember what Jesus said pray that</text>
  <text start="1579.68" dur="4.17">your flight be not on the Sabbath or in</text>
  <text start="1581.93" dur="3.6">winter for when it is that&amp;#39;s when Great</text>
  <text start="1583.85" dur="5.13">Tribulation is so here we have a year in</text>
  <text start="1585.53" dur="4.92">which Purim actually falls on a weekly</text>
  <text start="1588.98" dur="4.02">Sabbath which doesn&amp;#39;t happen every year</text>
  <text start="1590.45" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s in the winter and so it&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="1593" dur="5.43">contention that it&amp;#39;s February 24th 2024</text>
  <text start="1595.55" dur="6.9">that that is when the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="1598.43" dur="7.08">the flight is going to begin okay</text>
  <text start="1602.45" dur="4.56">when the woman begins her traveling to</text>
  <text start="1605.51" dur="3">the safe place wherever that will be as</text>
  <text start="1607.01" dur="6.24">talked about in Revelation 12 when this</text>
  <text start="1608.51" dur="7.94">whole thing starts coming down now if</text>
  <text start="1613.25" dur="7.89">you go to March 20th about a month later</text>
  <text start="1616.45" dur="6.19">March 20th of 2024 because the Jews are</text>
  <text start="1621.14" dur="3.57">following the wrong calendar they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1622.64" dur="3.75">starting it a month early which you know</text>
  <text start="1624.71" dur="4.26">that doesn&amp;#39;t happen every year this year</text>
  <text start="1626.39" dur="4.98">the true biblical calendar is pretty</text>
  <text start="1628.97" dur="5.07">much right in line with the Jewish</text>
  <text start="1631.37" dur="5.52">calendar but every three to five years</text>
  <text start="1634.04" dur="6.57">you have this discrepancy so again on</text>
  <text start="1636.89" dur="5.16">March 20 and 24 that is when the Jews</text>
  <text start="1640.61" dur="3.54">will be celebrating their counterfeit</text>
  <text start="1642.05" dur="3.54">land a land day happens always on the</text>
  <text start="1644.15" dur="3.57">tenth day of the first month it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="1645.59" dur="4.8">four days before Passover lamb days the</text>
  <text start="1647.72" dur="6.42">day you select your lamb you inspect it</text>
  <text start="1650.39" dur="5.28">make sure it&amp;#39;s pure and you have it for</text>
  <text start="1654.14" dur="3.87">four days and please slaughter it on</text>
  <text start="1655.67" dur="5.25">Passover so so the counterfeit lamb day</text>
  <text start="1658.01" dur="3.799">will be on March 20th 2024 McHale</text>
  <text start="1660.92" dur="3.829">counterfeit cow</text>
  <text start="1661.809" dur="5.46">and if you go from March 20th 2024</text>
  <text start="1664.749" dur="4.91">always began the piece of Trumpets which</text>
  <text start="1667.269" dur="5.671">is October 1st 2027 you have exactly</text>
  <text start="1669.659" dur="5.35">1290 days so it&amp;#39;s my contention that on</text>

  <text start="2276.99" dur="4.98">who the son of perdition was thousands</text>
  <text start="2278.82" dur="5.88">of years ago it&amp;#39;s not a mystery jesus</text>
  <text start="2281.97" dur="4.619">said in John 17 you have given me all of</text>

  <text start="2292.14" dur="4.25">thousand years ago gets Phila Satan he</text>
  <text start="2293.82" dur="4.98">said he was a thief he had a very good</text>
  <text start="2296.39" dur="3.729">outside veneer all the disciples loved</text>
  <text start="2298.8" dur="3.66">and respected him and thought he was a</text>
  <text start="2300.119" dur="3.461">great man of God but inwardly he was a</text>
  <text start="2302.46" dur="2.95">thief</text>
  <text start="2303.58" dur="3.39">like these globalist bankers he was</text>
  <text start="2305.41" dur="3.75">driven by the love of money which is the</text>
  <text start="2306.97" dur="5.52">root of all evil and he betrayed Jesus</text>
  <text start="2309.16" dur="6.45">and the scripture says that he winds up</text>
  <text start="2312.49" dur="5.46">committing suicide once his plan</text>
  <text start="2315.61" dur="4.08">backfires rather than repenting he</text>
  <text start="2317.95" dur="3.24">decides to murder himself which is the</text>
  <text start="2319.69" dur="4.05">ultimate act of selfishness and so he</text>
  <text start="2321.19" dur="4.53">dies in his sin and it says he hangs</text>
  <text start="2323.74" dur="4.62">himself and the Rope snaps and he falls</text>
  <text start="2325.72" dur="5.82">under the the the spirit his bowels gush</text>
  <text start="2328.36" dur="7.26">out and he dies he is dead but in Acts</text>
  <text start="2331.54" dur="5.79">chapter 1 it says that when Judas</text>
  <text start="2335.62" dur="4.41">Iscariot murdered himself and he died</text>
  <text start="2337.33" dur="5.13">that he went unto his own place which</text>
  <text start="2340.03" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s a very unusual phrase it&amp;#39;s used</text>
  <text start="2342.46" dur="4.62">at the very last verses of Acts chapter</text>
  <text start="2344.38" dur="4.29">1 what does that mean that Judas</text>
  <text start="2347.08" dur="3.09">Iscariot went to his own place it means</text>
  <text start="2348.67" dur="3.36">that he&amp;#39;s being preserved because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2350.17" dur="4.62">going to come back because Paul talks</text>
  <text start="2352.03" dur="6.96">about in 2nd Thessalonians that this man</text>
  <text start="2354.79" dur="6.69">of sin the son of perdition will declare</text>
  <text start="2358.99" dur="6.42">himself to be God he&amp;#39;ll say that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2361.48" dur="6.3">the Messiah Oh Paul uses the same phrase</text>
  <text start="2365.41" dur="5.1">son of perdition that Jesus used in John</text>
  <text start="2367.78" dur="5.37">17 so Paul identifies that Judas</text>
  <text start="2370.51" dur="4.59">Iscariot is gonna be the Antichrist and</text>
  <text start="2373.15" dur="4.17">it makes sense you know</text>
  <text start="2375.1" dur="5.01">all 12 disciples were from the 12 tribes</text>
  <text start="2377.32" dur="4.74">of Israel Judas was the one from Judah</text>
  <text start="2380.11" dur="6.57">just like Jesus so Judas Iscariot would</text>
  <text start="2382.06" dur="6.54">have looked very similar to Jesus and so</text>
  <text start="2386.68" dur="4.14">Judas Iscariot he&amp;#39;s gonna come back and</text>
  <text start="2388.6" dur="5.67">he&amp;#39;s gonna be this counterfeit</text>
  <text start="2390.82" dur="5.64">this counterfeit Messiah he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2394.27" dur="5">gonna believe that he is the Messiah cuz</text>
  <text start="2396.46" dur="5.4">think about it he kills himself in</text>
  <text start="2399.27" dur="4.54">selfish misery and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="2401.86" dur="3.54">he&amp;#39;s back on earth alive so he&amp;#39;s like I</text>
  <text start="2403.81" dur="3.24">must have been the Messiah cuz look I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2405.4" dur="4.53">resurrected so he&amp;#39;s really gonna believe</text>
  <text start="2407.05" dur="4.74">and you know Satan filled him on that</text>
  <text start="2409.93" dur="4.08">night Passover when he portrayed Jesus</text>
  <text start="2411.79" dur="3.54">2,000 years ago so he&amp;#39;s just gonna pick</text>
  <text start="2414.01" dur="3.42">up right where he left off Satan&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2415.33" dur="4.05">fill him and he is gonna be the son of</text>
  <text start="2417.43" dur="4.32">perdition its Judas Iscariot and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2419.38" dur="5.01">the one that&amp;#39;s gonna rule and reign from</text>
  <text start="2421.75" dur="4.86">Jerusalem because Jerusalem is going to</text>

  <text start="2427.72" dur="3.97">revelation 11</text>
  <text start="2428.48" dur="5.58">and those two witnesses are gonna stand</text>
  <text start="2431.69" dur="4.2">up under the power of yah and they for</text>
  <text start="2434.06" dur="4.019">the three and a half years of Judas</text>
  <text start="2435.89" dur="3.87">Iscariot reign of terror on earth</text>
  <text start="2438.079" dur="3.151">they&amp;#39;re gonna be preaching against him</text>

  <text start="2441.23" dur="5.28">gonna hate these two witnesses and</text>
  <text start="2443.829" dur="4.601">finally Judas Iscariot and his legions</text>
  <text start="2446.51" dur="4.47">are gonna be able to murder these two</text>
  <text start="2448.43" dur="3.78">witnesses and the world is gonna</text>
  <text start="2450.98" dur="2.79">celebrate because they&amp;#39;re gonna be lying</text>
  <text start="2452.21" dur="3.659">dead on the streets of Jerusalem for</text>
  <text start="2453.77" dur="3.569">three and a half days but after that</text>
  <text start="2455.869" dur="2.191">three half days they&amp;#39;re gonna rise up on</text>
  <text start="2457.339" dur="3.03">their feet they&amp;#39;re gonna have a</text>
  <text start="2458.06" dur="4.86">resurrection because yom teruah peace of</text>
  <text start="2460.369" dur="4.47">Trumpets is gonna be fulfilled and it</text>
  <text start="2462.92" dur="3.3">says the dead Messiah rise first and</text>
  <text start="2464.839" dur="3.78">then we who are alive to make it cut up</text>
  <text start="2466.22" dur="4.2">so those two witnesses rise up along</text>
  <text start="2468.619" dur="3.271">with all the other dead Messiah and we</text>
  <text start="2470.42" dur="2.97">who are alive and remain we get caught</text>
  <text start="2471.89" dur="3.63">up to be with them this is a public</text>
  <text start="2473.39" dur="3.54">event it causes a massive earthquake all</text>
  <text start="2475.52" dur="4.44">across the earth because think about it</text>
  <text start="2476.93" dur="5.189">you have all these graves bursting of</text>
  <text start="2479.96" dur="5.22">every single Christian that&amp;#39;s died over</text>
  <text start="2482.119" dur="4.261">the last even before in the Old</text>

  <text start="2486.38" dur="3.75">forward to the Messiah every single</text>
  <text start="2488.21" dur="4.32">Saint believer who died in righteousness</text>
  <text start="2490.13" dur="3.06">in the Messiah they&amp;#39;re gonna rise from</text>
  <text start="2492.53" dur="2.37">the graves</text>
  <text start="2493.19" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s gonna cause massive earthquakes in</text>
  <text start="2494.9" dur="4.26">fact it says when those two witnesses</text>
  <text start="2496.94" dur="3.87">arise in revelation 11 there&amp;#39;s such a</text>
  <text start="2499.16" dur="4.53">massive earthquake in Jerusalem that</text>
  <text start="2500.81" dur="4.89">seven thousand are killed and finally</text>
  <text start="2503.69" dur="4.2">those who remain in Jerusalem the Jews</text>
  <text start="2505.7" dur="4.59">finally repent and there&amp;#39;s a revival</text>
  <text start="2507.89" dur="3.36">finally after that seventh resurrection</text>
  <text start="2510.29" dur="3.12">right toward the end of the Great</text>
  <text start="2511.25" dur="4.74">Tribulation but of course they missed</text>
  <text start="2513.41" dur="3.99">the resurrection so this centre of</text>
  <text start="2515.99" dur="4.44">perdition is going to rule and reign and</text>
  <text start="2517.4" dur="4.59">you know I believe that as we continue</text>
  <text start="2520.43" dur="3">to go forward in this Golden Age that</text>
  <text start="2521.99" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re in right now this temporary</text>
  <text start="2523.43" dur="5.1">reprieve that the guillotines are gonna</text>
  <text start="2526.22" dur="4.08">be brought out and they&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="2528.53" dur="4.65">publicly executing these satanic</text>
  <text start="2530.3" dur="4.47">pedophiles all the things that the deep</text>

  <text start="2538.28" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;re gonna be used against them like</text>
  <text start="2540.319" dur="3.091">a Purim</text>
  <text start="2541.01" dur="4.89">you know Haman built this gallows to</text>
  <text start="2543.41" dur="3.57">hang Mordecai and then Haman himself</text>
  <text start="2545.9" dur="3.84">wound up getting caught up in the</text>
  <text start="2546.98" dur="4.47">gallows but after this Golden Age is</text>
  <text start="2549.74" dur="3.27">over those guillotines which have now</text>
  <text start="2551.45" dur="3.33">been used as</text>
  <text start="2553.01" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re now going to be turned on the</text>
  <text start="2554.78" dur="5.28">believers now how is it going to happen</text>
  <text start="2557.72" dur="4.08">because if my timeline is correct and</text>
  <text start="2560.06" dur="3.8">again I&amp;#39;m not saying it is my dates</text>
  <text start="2561.8" dur="4.77">could be wrong but if it&amp;#39;s correct then</text>
  <text start="2563.86" dur="4.03">winter of 2024 is still a full year</text>
  <text start="2566.57" dur="3.24">before President Trump would leave</text>
  <text start="2567.89" dur="4.17">office so how would it happen</text>
  <text start="2569.81" dur="5.43">that this Great Tribulation would begin</text>
  <text start="2572.06" dur="4.59">when President Trump still has several</text>

  <text start="2576.65" dur="4.68">office in January 2025 well there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2579.83" dur="3.03">lot of ways that could happen I do</text>
  <text start="2581.33" dur="4.83">believe that President Trump is very</text>
  <text start="2582.86" dur="5.1">similar to King David and King David had</text>
  <text start="2586.16" dur="2.25">a son named Absalom and if you read the</text>

  <text start="2588.41" dur="4.62">Absalom toward the end of King David&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2590.51" dur="4.35">life Absalom was sort of a picture of</text>
  <text start="2593.03" dur="3.96">the Antichrist and he rose up in a</text>
  <text start="2594.86" dur="6.06">rebellion and caused so much trouble</text>
  <text start="2596.99" dur="6.63">that David and his top leadership had to</text>
  <text start="2600.92" dur="5.43">flee Israel and Absalon sort of took</text>
  <text start="2603.62" dur="4.77">over Israel for a period of time and I</text>
  <text start="2606.35" dur="4.29">believe that President Trump has an axle</text>

  <text start="2614.26" dur="4.63">President Trump for the end of his</text>

  <text start="2633.2" dur="3.21">remember it says that at the very</text>
