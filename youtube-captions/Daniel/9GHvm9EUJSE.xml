  <text start="54.629" dur="3.421">till it hits the floor to leave behind</text>
  <text start="56.07" dur="4.59">the calcite that&amp;#39;s how you get these</text>
  <text start="58.05" dur="4.439">formations and they do grow closer</text>
  <text start="60.66" dur="4.17">together and eventually meet to form a</text>
  <text start="62.489" dur="3.81">column and that&amp;#39;s kind of like the grand</text>
