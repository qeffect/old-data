  <text start="37.61" dur="6.33">functioning well and some of these are</text>
  <text start="41.07" dur="5.489">going to go beyond the the scriptural</text>
  <text start="43.94" dur="3.549">commandments that are in the tour app so</text>
  <text start="46.559" dur="2.971">I&amp;#39;m not suggesting that these</text>
  <text start="47.489" dur="5.64">Commandments are something that are you</text>
  <text start="49.53" dur="5.43">know salvation alysha&amp;#39;s but if you</text>
  <text start="53.129" dur="3.27">follow these guidelines I think that it</text>
  <text start="54.96" dur="6.21">will really help you feel a lot to</text>
  <text start="56.399" dur="5.971">healthier and just overall better so</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="3.059">first of all we&amp;#39;re going to start off</text>
  <text start="62.37" dur="4.59">with of course you want to follow the</text>
  <text start="64.229" dur="5.731">dietary laws in Leviticus 11 which</text>
  <text start="66.96" dur="5.61">include no short excuse me no pork or</text>
  <text start="69.96" dur="4.38">shellfish and there&amp;#39;s of course a list</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="4.77">of other unclean foods that you can read</text>
  <text start="74.34" dur="4.919">about in Leviticus 11 also something</text>
  <text start="77.34" dur="3.24">that some people don&amp;#39;t know about but it</text>
  <text start="79.259" dur="4.801">is actually confirmed in the New</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="5.7">Testament when Acts chapter 15 no animal</text>
  <text start="84.06" dur="6.629">you eat should have any blood or be</text>
  <text start="86.28" dur="6.99">strangled okay most American meat is</text>
  <text start="90.689" dur="6.061">just tend to be very bloody unless you</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="6.51">get a nice grass-fed organic beef or me</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="4.74">that at the whole foods market a lot of</text>
  <text start="99.78" dur="3.9">meat that we tend to eat that we buy at</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="5.37">the store tends to be very bloody even</text>
  <text start="103.68" dur="4.619">the so-called kosher meat so what you</text>
  <text start="106.86" dur="2.91">need to do in order to drain the blood</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="4.291">is after you buy your meeting you to</text>
  <text start="109.77" dur="5.07">fill a large bowl of water and then</text>
  <text start="112.59" dur="5.16">cover the meat in a layer of crucial</text>
  <text start="114.84" dur="5.639">salt when you soak the meat for a few</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="5.46">hours in this bowl of water coated in</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="4.591">salt and and what that happens is this</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="4.35">will leach the blood add the meat and it</text>
  <text start="125.07" dur="4.409">drains into the water then you just</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="3.04">remove the meat and your rinse you rinse</text>
  <text start="129.479" dur="3.761">the salt off and while</text>
  <text start="130.6" dur="5.49">you&amp;#39;re your reef has been drained of all</text>
  <text start="133.24" dur="5.85">blood this especially as you be done</text>
  <text start="136.09" dur="5.01">with beef and again like I said even</text>
  <text start="139.09" dur="4.28">so-called kosher beef tends to be bloody</text>
  <text start="141.1" dur="4.05">but it&amp;#39;s also going to do on poultry</text>
  <text start="143.37" dur="4.68">because sometimes you&amp;#39;ll notice that</text>
  <text start="145.15" dur="4.98">blood does drain from poultry as well</text>
  <text start="148.05" dur="3.43">and this is very very important because</text>
  <text start="150.13" dur="3.48">this is something that is commanded by</text>
  <text start="151.48" dur="4.71">yah we&amp;#39;re commanded not to eat eat blood</text>
  <text start="153.61" dur="4.56">and so it&amp;#39;s very important to remove as</text>
  <text start="156.19" dur="4.14">much as well as possible from from your</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="3.99">meat and it will cut down on heart</text>
  <text start="160.33" dur="5.49">disease and help you to live much</text>
  <text start="162.16" dur="6.51">healthier the next point I want to make</text>
  <text start="165.82" dur="5.31">is concerns dairy of course a lot of us</text>
  <text start="168.67" dur="4.71">probably like to drink milk and consume</text>
  <text start="171.13" dur="5.34">cheese and butter I know I do and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="173.38" dur="6.93">nothing wrong with dairy but you should</text>
  <text start="176.47" dur="6.24">only buy raw milk cheese and butter and</text>
  <text start="180.31" dur="4.8">it will say Raw on the container when</text>
  <text start="182.71" dur="4.65">you purchase it Whole Foods is a really</text>
  <text start="185.11" dur="5.94">good source to buy raw cheese and raw</text>
  <text start="187.36" dur="6.87">butter only a few states still sell raw</text>
  <text start="191.05" dur="6.14">milk in their stores so you may have to</text>
  <text start="194.23" dur="6.57">go directly to a dairy farm in order to</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="5.86">to get robbed milk I have a local dairy</text>
  <text start="200.8" dur="4.8">form that i go to here in the portland</text>
  <text start="203.05" dur="4.98">area and and i&amp;#39;m able to purchase raw</text>
  <text start="205.6" dur="6.57">milk there every week and that&amp;#39;s what i</text>
  <text start="208.03" dur="6.21">do raw milk and cheese and butter is</text>
  <text start="212.17" dur="3.69">really the only way to ensure that</text>
  <text start="214.24" dur="5.52">you&amp;#39;re eating dairy the way that yah</text>
  <text start="215.86" dur="6.03">intended you to consume dairy and of</text>
  <text start="219.76" dur="4.68">course there&amp;#39;s a lot of added bacteria</text>
  <text start="221.89" dur="5.15">that&amp;#39;s in raw milk especially also in</text>
  <text start="224.44" dur="6.42">raw butter and raw cheese that&amp;#39;s not in</text>
  <text start="227.04" dur="7.24">process and modernized milk and dairy</text>
  <text start="230.86" dur="5.4">products and so it really helps in terms</text>
  <text start="234.28" dur="6.96">of keeping you healthy and giving you</text>
  <text start="236.26" dur="6.63">good bacteria that your body needs when</text>
  <text start="241.24" dur="3.9">it comes to meet you want to buy only</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="3.72">organic grass-fed meat and you can</text>
  <text start="245.14" dur="4.86">usually find this at like a whole food</text>
  <text start="246.61" dur="5.58">store or any health store if you read</text>
  <text start="250" dur="3.97">the scriptures Torah commands cattle to</text>
  <text start="252.19" dur="3.82">eat grass ok the cattle</text>
  <text start="253.97" dur="5.34">eats grass you never see an example</text>
  <text start="256.01" dur="8.04">where the children of Israel fed their</text>
  <text start="259.31" dur="6.84">their animals grains or the meat of</text>
  <text start="264.05" dur="5.54">other animals because what happens is</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="8.1">when you feed cattle grain or or meat</text>
  <text start="269.59" dur="6.7">fat marbles the beef and remember Torah</text>
  <text start="274.25" dur="3.9">commands us not to eat any fact we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="276.29" dur="3.93">supposed to cut the fat away but when</text>
  <text start="278.15" dur="4.83">fat has marbled the beef it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="280.22" dur="4.56">difficult to avoid eating the fact and</text>
  <text start="282.98" dur="4.08">in fact in America this is a this is a</text>
  <text start="284.78" dur="5.22">purposeful tactic to try to flavor the</text>
  <text start="287.06" dur="4.38">meat by marbling the meat with fat so</text>
  <text start="290" dur="3.66">this is this is actually a commandment</text>
  <text start="291.44" dur="4.23">in Torah that you should follow when you</text>
  <text start="293.66" dur="3.81">buy be four it have a meat from the</text>
  <text start="295.67" dur="4.14">store make sure that it&amp;#39;s organic</text>
  <text start="297.47" dur="5.79">grass-fed and that way you&amp;#39;ll avoid</text>
  <text start="299.81" dur="6.15">eating the fat that marbles the typical</text>
  <text start="303.26" dur="5.85">meat out there when it comes to poultry</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="5.79">like chicken or eggs make sure it&amp;#39;s free</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="5.25">range what this means is that chickens</text>
  <text start="311.75" dur="4.44">are allowed to wander free and eat</text>
  <text start="314.36" dur="3.96">whatever they find rather than being</text>
  <text start="316.19" dur="5.13">confined inside a lab or a shed and</text>
  <text start="318.32" dur="5.91">forced eat blood junk and other things</text>
  <text start="321.32" dur="5.28">so make sure you buy organic free-range</text>
  <text start="324.23" dur="5.22">eggs they do tend to be more expensive</text>
  <text start="326.6" dur="4.47">but but this really is the only way that</text>
  <text start="329.45" dur="3.9">Yount ended for us to eat poultry and</text>
  <text start="331.07" dur="4.59">eggs things like that when it comes to</text>
  <text start="333.35" dur="4.5">fruits and vegetables make sure that</text>
  <text start="335.66" dur="3.69">they have the organic label and yes they</text>
  <text start="337.85" dur="3.36">are more expensive than the typical</text>
  <text start="339.35" dur="3.72">fruits and vegetables without organic</text>
  <text start="341.21" dur="2.91">labeling but this is the only way to</text>
  <text start="343.07" dur="3.57">make sure that your fruits and</text>
  <text start="344.12" dur="4.98">vegetables don&amp;#39;t have pesticides on them</text>
  <text start="346.64" dur="6.69">and pesticides can really cause a lot of</text>
  <text start="349.1" dur="5.79">problems in the body juices when you buy</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="3.81">juice try to make sure that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="354.89" dur="6.21">unfiltered one hundred percent organic I</text>
  <text start="357.14" dur="6.36">like to buy the organic grape juice that</text>
  <text start="361.1" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s at whole foods for Sabbath I also</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="3.69">like to get the unfiltered hundred</text>
  <text start="364.76" dur="4.71">percent organic apple juice which</text>
  <text start="367.19" dur="3.96">literally still has the Apple peelings</text>
  <text start="369.47" dur="5.43">and things at the bottom of the</text>
  <text start="371.15" dur="7.44">the of the chart breads a really good</text>
  <text start="374.9" dur="6.09">read by is organic spelt all modern</text>
  <text start="378.59" dur="4.83">wheat has been genetically modified even</text>
  <text start="380.99" dur="4.35">if it&amp;#39;s not labeled but spelt is an</text>
  <text start="383.42" dur="3.51">ancient relation to wheat which is the</text>
  <text start="385.34" dur="4.23">most natural bread flour on the market</text>
  <text start="386.93" dur="4.11">and spelt can be used unlike whole wheat</text>
  <text start="389.57" dur="3.06">which you can use all week but it</text>
  <text start="391.04" dur="4.32">doesn&amp;#39;t taste really good when you use</text>
  <text start="392.63" dur="4.41">it for various types of cakes and</text>

  <text start="417.98" dur="4.53">process soy here in the United States</text>
  <text start="419.51" dur="6.26">it&amp;#39;s not healthy and actually tends to</text>
  <text start="422.51" dur="5.88">cause people to become effeminate and</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="5.47">because it increases the estrogen levels</text>
  <text start="428.39" dur="8.73">in a person&amp;#39;s body so try to avoid the</text>
  <text start="431.24" dur="8.76">whole soy based food health stuff so</text>
