  <text start="33.75" dur="4.2">probably one of the most misunderstood</text>
  <text start="35.219" dur="3.901">things and all of Christendom and so</text>
  <text start="37.95" dur="3.269">it&amp;#39;s really important just to go to the</text>
  <text start="39.12" dur="4.17">scripture and see how the very New</text>
  <text start="41.219" dur="3.891">Testament itself defines grace and we</text>
  <text start="43.29" dur="4.62">can find that in Titus chapter 2</text>
  <text start="45.11" dur="5.62">starting in verse 11 and going through</text>
  <text start="47.91" dur="6.719">verses 14 so let&amp;#39;s just get right into</text>

  <text start="61.26" dur="3.719">this grace has appeared now he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="62.52" dur="5.25">to define in verse 12 teaching us so</text>
  <text start="64.979" dur="5.481">what is what does grace do grace teaches</text>
  <text start="67.77" dur="5.81">us that denying ungodliness and worldly</text>
  <text start="70.46" dur="7.33">lusts we should live soberly righteously</text>
  <text start="73.58" dur="5.62">and godly in this present world looking</text>
  <text start="77.79" dur="3.78">for that blessed hope and the glorious</text>

  <text start="81.57" dur="6.659">Savior Yahshua HaMashiach hallelujah</text>
  <text start="84.2" dur="7.379">verse 14 who gave himself for us that he</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="6.061">might redeem us from all iniquity and</text>
  <text start="91.579" dur="6.461">purify unto himself a peculiar people</text>
  <text start="94.29" dur="6">zealous of good works okay so I want to</text>
  <text start="98.04" dur="6.48">send her in so basically verses 12</text>
  <text start="100.29" dur="6.06">through 14 defines what grace does how</text>
  <text start="104.52" dur="5.52">what it teaches us what it shows us to</text>
  <text start="106.35" dur="7.229">do and in verse 14 is really clear</text>
  <text start="110.04" dur="7.38">really key because it says this Messiah</text>
  <text start="113.579" dur="5.701">okay who&amp;#39;s giving us this grace he gave</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="3.629">himself for us that he might redeem us</text>
  <text start="119.28" dur="3.72">from all iniquity</text>
  <text start="121.049" dur="6.96">now that word iniquity if you look it up</text>
  <text start="123" dur="8.009">in the Greek is anti Nomos that means</text>
  <text start="128.009" dur="5.071">against the law of Moses but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.009" dur="3.211">literally what that word means against</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="5.1">the law of</text>
  <text start="134.22" dur="5.58">against the Mosaic law so he gave</text>
  <text start="138.18" dur="5.55">himself for us that he might redeem us</text>
  <text start="139.8" dur="6.09">from being against the Mosaic law why</text>
  <text start="143.73" dur="5.45">because if we go to the earlier verses</text>
  <text start="145.89" dur="7.29">of 12 through 13 it says what grace does</text>
  <text start="149.18" dur="6.94">Grace each&amp;#39;s us to deny ungodliness and</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="5.43">worldly lusts and to live soberly</text>
  <text start="156.12" dur="4.95">righteously and godly well how do we</text>
  <text start="158.61" dur="4.92">live soberly righteously and godly well</text>
  <text start="161.07" dur="4.77">the Torah and the prophets show us how</text>
  <text start="163.53" dur="5.16">to live soberly righteously and godly</text>
  <text start="165.84" dur="5.6">the Torah and the prophets show us how</text>
  <text start="168.69" dur="4.98">to deny ungodliness and real good luck</text>
  <text start="171.44" dur="4.78">Yahshua himself when he walked this</text>
  <text start="173.67" dur="5.58">earth he kept the Torah perfectly out of</text>
  <text start="176.22" dur="4.8">a heart of love for the father he showed</text>
  <text start="179.25" dur="4.23">us how to walk out the Torah in the in</text>
  <text start="181.02" dur="5.22">the right manner and that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="5.01">grace teaches us to do so Yahshua</text>
  <text start="186.24" dur="4.71">literally gave himself for us that he</text>
  <text start="188.49" dur="4.92">might redeem us from being against the</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="5.04">Torah of Moses look that word iniquity</text>
  <text start="193.41" dur="5.18">up that&amp;#39;s exactly what it means and to</text>
  <text start="195.99" dur="5.25">purify unto himself a peculiar people</text>
  <text start="198.59" dur="5.29">Israel all through the Tanakh was</text>
  <text start="201.24" dur="4.53">referred to as a peculiar people as his</text>
  <text start="203.88" dur="4.29">prized possession things haven&amp;#39;t changed</text>
  <text start="205.77" dur="7.68">he&amp;#39;s the same yesterday today and</text>
  <text start="208.17" dur="7.95">forever and so are his people purifying</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="5.13">himself a peculiar people zealous of</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="5.07">good works again what are these good</text>
  <text start="218.58" dur="4.74">works well these good works are defined</text>
  <text start="221.19" dur="4.83">all through the Torah keeping the</text>
  <text start="223.32" dur="4.44">Sabbath day eating clean foods loving</text>
  <text start="226.02" dur="2.939">your neighbor as yourself loving yah</text>
  <text start="227.76" dur="4.41">with all your heart soul mind and</text>
  <text start="228.959" dur="5.161">strength these Commandments are the good</text>
  <text start="232.17" dur="4.98">works that we are expected to do and</text>
  <text start="234.12" dur="5.49">that we can do through this grace that</text>
  <text start="237.15" dur="4.559">teaches us to obey Torah this is also</text>
  <text start="239.61" dur="3.84">going to dovetail into a future part</text>
  <text start="241.709" dur="6.391">here when I go over Hebrews chapter</text>
  <text start="243.45" dur="6.48">eight because remember the whole essence</text>
  <text start="248.1" dur="4.02">of the New Covenant is that this Torah</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="4.02">is not just written on tablets of stone</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="4.86">but it&amp;#39;s now written on our hearts it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.95" dur="6.45">in word so this grace that Yahshua has</text>
  <text start="256.98" dur="5.76">given us that he&amp;#39;s used to purify us is</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="4.5">actually allowing us from the inside out</text>
  <text start="262.74" dur="4.17">to obey this Torah that was formerly</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="3.87">written on tablets of stone</text>
  <text start="266.91" dur="4.14">and again we&amp;#39;ll get more into that when</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="5.07">we get into the future part of the P</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="5.01">Bruce chapter 8 so fall very clearly</text>
  <text start="273.84" dur="3.57">very clearly very succinctly defines</text>
  <text start="276.06" dur="4.02">what grace is</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="5.96">so whenever a Christian talks about the</text>
  <text start="280.08" dur="6.3">grace of God about his beautiful grace</text>
  <text start="283.37" dur="4.57">what it literally means what it should</text>
  <text start="286.38" dur="3.87">mean although I know it doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="287.94" dur="4.68">like this in the mind of many people who</text>
  <text start="290.25" dur="4.41">read the New Testament but what what the</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="6.09">grace really means is that it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="294.66" dur="5.94">which teaches us to walk in the Torah he</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="4.38">who redeemed us from being against the</text>
  <text start="300.6" dur="5.93">Torah now has purified us so that we can</text>
  <text start="303.09" dur="6.15">walk in the Torah out of a heart of love</text>
  <text start="306.53" dur="4.5">Paul is very clear you can&amp;#39;t get any</text>
  <text start="309.24" dur="4.68">more black-and-white than this</text>
  <text start="311.03" dur="4.42">hallelujah well this is a very short</text>
  <text start="313.92" dur="3.75">teaching but I had a feeling because</text>
  <text start="315.45" dur="3.54">when I prayed about this ya told me this</text>
  <text start="317.67" dur="3">is going to be a very succinct and</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="4.41">to-the-point teaching but I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="320.67" dur="5.52">also very powerful and really shows you</text>
  <text start="323.4" dur="5.03">how Paul again is always continuing to</text>
  <text start="326.19" dur="4.77">uphold Torah even as the Messiah did</text>
  <text start="328.43" dur="6.04">this is Daniel John Lee with poor</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="8.09">restoration ministries website is WWF it</text>
  <text start="334.47" dur="4.58">and Torah calm shabbat shalom</text>
