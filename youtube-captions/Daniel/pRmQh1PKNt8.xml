  <text start="0.03" dur="6.66">three okay Shalom Shalom everybody I</text>
  <text start="4.44" dur="5.699">have a very special guest with me today</text>
  <text start="6.69" dur="5.489">her name is Marnie Grundmann and she has</text>
  <text start="10.139" dur="5.401">actually been featured on over 100 major</text>
  <text start="12.179" dur="6.031">television and radio shows in Canada the</text>
  <text start="15.54" dur="4.829">United States and Europe all over but</text>
  <text start="18.21" dur="5.04">she actually went as a very young child</text>
  <text start="20.369" dur="6.181">she went through a horrific case where</text>
  <text start="23.25" dur="7.529">she literally spent living years living</text>
  <text start="26.55" dur="6.24">on the streets basically now what she</text>
  <text start="30.779" dur="4.291">has done with her life is she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="32.79" dur="4.289">trying to help children that have gone</text>
  <text start="35.07" dur="5.579">missing within the foster care system</text>
  <text start="37.079" dur="6.061">and since my channel is focused on</text>
  <text start="40.649" dur="4.59">exposing child sex trafficking the human</text>
  <text start="43.14" dur="4.169">trafficking all of the stuff that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="45.239" dur="3.631">going on including a lot of the abuses</text>
  <text start="47.309" dur="4.171">that have gone on within the foster care</text>
  <text start="48.87" dur="5.009">system I really wanted Marnie to come on</text>
  <text start="51.48" dur="4.739">today and share with us both what she</text>
  <text start="53.879" dur="4.261">went through as a little girl and then</text>
  <text start="56.219" dur="4.951">now what she&amp;#39;s doing currently to help</text>
  <text start="58.14" dur="4.23">with this issue so Marnie without</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="3.269">further ado I&amp;#39;m gonna hand it over to</text>
  <text start="62.37" dur="4.83">you and just let you kind of start from</text>
  <text start="64.439" dur="6.151">the beginning of your story okay thank</text>
  <text start="67.2" dur="6.599">you so much well to kind of go backwards</text>
  <text start="70.59" dur="5.16">I guess I was 13 years old when I ran</text>
  <text start="73.799" dur="4.651">away from home for the final time I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="75.75" dur="5.49">actually been running on and off since I</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="5.489">was five or six years old my family</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="5.76">background is one that was riddled with</text>
  <text start="83.939" dur="5.671">abuse one of my earliest memories is of</text>
  <text start="87" dur="6.96">my mother dropping me out of a two-story</text>
  <text start="89.61" dur="7.049">window and I was five at the time this</text>
  <text start="93.96" dur="5.61">is not an unusual story for a child who</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="5.731">ends up on the streets and in the first</text>
  <text start="99.57" dur="6.24">year and a half I lived on park benches</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="7.17">in abandoned buildings apartment complex</text>
  <text start="105.81" dur="6.21">saunas until I finally found a job I</text>
  <text start="109.56" dur="7.199">looked into a job 14 and a half as a</text>
  <text start="112.02" dur="7.26">cocktail waitress of all things and from</text>
  <text start="116.759" dur="4.981">there I managed to get a place to live</text>
  <text start="119.28" dur="3.89">and it seemed like things were coming</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="3.57">together for me</text>
  <text start="123.17" dur="4.54">unfortunately at some point in time I I</text>
  <text start="125.31" dur="3.18">did lose that job and when I looked for</text>
  <text start="127.71" dur="3.27">another one</text>
  <text start="128.49" dur="6.47">I ended up responding to an ad and I was</text>
  <text start="130.98" dur="8.87">trafficked for labor and went from Miami</text>
  <text start="134.96" dur="8.95">Olive place finally escaping Indiana and</text>
  <text start="139.85" dur="6.4">my story is not unusual you know one in</text>
  <text start="143.91" dur="4.11">these six runways end up being</text>
  <text start="146.25" dur="3.51">trafficked so I think it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="148.02" dur="5.28">important that we&amp;#39;re talking about this</text>
  <text start="149.76" dur="5.97">not just because of the experiences that</text>
  <text start="153.3" dur="4.53">kids who runaway go through and the fact</text>
  <text start="155.73" dur="4.08">that the majority of them are coming</text>
  <text start="157.83" dur="4.59">from homes where they have been</text>
  <text start="159.81" dur="5.94">experiencing some sort of abuse but also</text>
  <text start="162.42" dur="5.13">because of not intervening when we know</text>
  <text start="165.75" dur="5.79">and see that these kids are running</text>
  <text start="167.55" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re also feeding traffickers with more</text>
  <text start="171.54" dur="5.49">victims because these are the kids that</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="5.13">are the easiest to grab and and buy grab</text>
  <text start="177.03" dur="3.6">I don&amp;#39;t mean kidnapped because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="178.53" dur="6.69">not how trafficking works so the easiest</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="7.8">to lure okay so so go into more about</text>
  <text start="185.22" dur="5.82">that what do you mean by by by all of</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="5.27">that in terms of easiest to lure well I</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="5.7">mean think about it we&amp;#39;re the kids that</text>
  <text start="193.7" dur="7.18">are either living on the streets that I</text>
  <text start="196.74" dur="8.09">the way that I was with no protection no</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="7.14">family no love no care and no food and</text>
  <text start="204.83" dur="6.19">you&amp;#39;re somebody who is a predator</text>
  <text start="208.02" dur="5.82">looking to take advantage and make money</text>
  <text start="211.02" dur="5.1">off of somebody like that all you have</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="4.56">to do is be like you know are you hungry</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="6.18">can I take you in can I get something</text>
  <text start="218.4" dur="6.27">for you being just a little bit nice it</text>
  <text start="222.3" dur="5.54">is really unfortunately all it takes</text>
  <text start="224.67" dur="5.73">because we&amp;#39;re so alone and we&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="227.84" dur="5.68">unprotected even when I had a place to</text>
  <text start="230.4" dur="4.8">live I didn&amp;#39;t have anybody who loved me</text>
  <text start="233.52" dur="5.27">and cared for me and was looking out for</text>
  <text start="235.2" dur="6.27">me and I didn&amp;#39;t have the life experience</text>
  <text start="238.79" dur="4.66">to know when somebody was trying to take</text>
  <text start="241.47" dur="4.08">advantage of me or when they were</text>
  <text start="243.45" dur="3.57">actually just being nice I mean even if</text>
  <text start="245.55" dur="4.32">you think about it in your adult life</text>
  <text start="247.02" dur="5.1">now and you meet somebody new you know</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="4.11">we take people at face value and then</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="3.96">find out that maybe they weren&amp;#39;t quite</text>
  <text start="253.98" dur="4.62">what they seemed well now if you magnify</text>
  <text start="256.08" dur="5.159">that and just somebody who actually you</text>
  <text start="258.6" dur="3.66">know is not only not what they see but</text>
  <text start="261.239" dur="5.611">there&amp;#39;s somebody</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="6.69">with with a plan for you and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="266.85" dur="5.64">something that these kids that I myself</text>
  <text start="268.95" dur="5.88">get sucked into very very easily and it</text>
  <text start="272.49" dur="4.44">was years I mean really not until the</text>
  <text start="274.83" dur="4.17">last year or so that I went oh my god I</text>
  <text start="276.93" dur="4.59">was actually trafficked I didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="279" dur="4.92">look at it that way because the way the</text>
  <text start="281.52" dur="4.2">media portrays trafficking victims you</text>
  <text start="283.92" dur="4.68">know I should have been held against my</text>
  <text start="285.72" dur="4.83">will well I wasn&amp;#39;t there willingly in</text>
  <text start="288.6" dur="3.84">terms of you know I wanted to get paid</text>
  <text start="290.55" dur="4.47">and I wanted to save money and I wanted</text>
  <text start="292.44" dur="4.23">to get back on my own feet and I could</text>
  <text start="295.02" dur="5.1">have walked out and at one point I did</text>
  <text start="296.67" dur="6.06">escape I was afraid of them and I was</text>
  <text start="300.12" dur="4.55">also in a situation where I didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="302.73" dur="5.13">to end up back on a park bench again</text>
  <text start="304.67" dur="6.85">right right yeah definitely definitely</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="5.82">very vulnerable so I guess one question</text>
  <text start="311.52" dur="5.19">I think probably that my audience has is</text>
  <text start="313.68" dur="4.47">you know we have this we&amp;#39;re growing up</text>
  <text start="316.71" dur="3.57">if we come from you know healthy</text>
  <text start="318.15" dur="3.42">families we had this idea that oh you</text>
  <text start="320.28" dur="3.09">know the foster care system is a</text>
  <text start="321.57" dur="5.37">wonderful system it it helps children</text>
  <text start="323.37" dur="6.3">and everything how how is this happening</text>
  <text start="326.94" dur="5.34">how how is it that so many children</text>
  <text start="329.67" dur="5.67">within the foster care system are going</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="4.98">missing so I just want to backtrack a</text>
  <text start="335.34" dur="5.01">little bit because I as a child thought</text>
  <text start="337.26" dur="5.34">the same thing and I think it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="340.35" dur="4.2">normal for us you know we have this idea</text>
  <text start="342.6" dur="4.08">that every child that is taken out of a</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="5.43">home is taken out of a home that is</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="5.82">severely riddled with abuse particularly</text>
  <text start="349.98" dur="3.84">physical or sexual and that where</text>
  <text start="352.5" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re going to be placed is so much</text>
  <text start="353.82" dur="7.29">better unfortunately the reality of the</text>
  <text start="357.57" dur="5.4">situation is that as many there are a</text>
  <text start="361.11" dur="3.75">lot of great foster parents just like</text>
  <text start="362.97" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s a lot of great foster care</text>
  <text start="364.86" dur="4.62">workers there&amp;#39;s also a lot of really bad</text>
  <text start="367.29" dur="5.25">ones we have issues with background</text>
  <text start="369.48" dur="5.46">checks in completing them in making sure</text>
  <text start="372.54" dur="6.3">that we&amp;#39;re placing a child in a safe</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="6.06">environment and as a result these kids</text>
  <text start="378.84" dur="4.86">are ending up either in group homes or</text>
  <text start="381" dur="5.37">in foster homes that should never be</text>
  <text start="383.7" dur="5.04">caring for children to begin with and so</text>
  <text start="386.37" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re what do they do you know do you</text>
  <text start="388.74" dur="4.77">stay for more abuse that you&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="390.84" dur="3.93">come from or do you run away and try to</text>
  <text start="393.51" dur="3.99">survive on your own</text>
  <text start="394.77" dur="4.679">and a lot of these kids unfortunately</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="4.259">and the ones that we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="399.449" dur="5.671">right now are kids that are running away</text>
  <text start="401.759" dur="5.821">for survival where they are is no better</text>
  <text start="405.12" dur="4.859">than where they were it may be that they</text>
  <text start="407.58" dur="4.019">got into a stable tosser home and then</text>
  <text start="409.979" dur="3.72">they were ripped out of that one and put</text>
  <text start="411.599" dur="4.231">in another one a lot of people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="413.699" dur="5.911">realize that most kids in the system</text>
  <text start="415.83" dur="5.76">within they spend I think 21 to 22</text>
  <text start="419.61" dur="4.5">months their first time in foster care</text>
  <text start="421.59" dur="6.09">and they will see the inside of minimum</text>
  <text start="424.11" dur="5.19">three different residences now somebody</text>
  <text start="427.68" dur="3.419">kind of flexed you out of your house</text>
  <text start="429.3" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s abusive let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re 10 years</text>
  <text start="431.099" dur="6.06">old they don&amp;#39;t explain much to you in in</text>
  <text start="434.46" dur="4.709">terms of what you can understand your</text>
  <text start="437.159" dur="4.771">stuff is thrown in a garbage bag and</text>
  <text start="439.169" dur="4.59">you&amp;#39;re taken to a place where you know</text>
  <text start="441.93" dur="5.609">nobody and told this is now where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="443.759" dur="6.78">gonna live and and nothing is going to</text>
  <text start="447.539" dur="4.68">happen from that I&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="450.539" dur="3.87">there aren&amp;#39;t situations that are better</text>
  <text start="452.219" dur="5.181">but the ones that we&amp;#39;re focused on are</text>
  <text start="454.409" dur="5.79">the ones that the kids are running from</text>
  <text start="457.4" dur="4.75">they run from these homes the social</text>
  <text start="460.199" dur="3.451">workers are overburdened a lot of times</text>
  <text start="462.15" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re not checking on all the kids</text>
  <text start="463.65" dur="4.47">they may or may not even know that</text>
  <text start="465.93" dur="4.229">they&amp;#39;re missing when they&amp;#39;re told that</text>
  <text start="468.12" dur="5.099">they&amp;#39;re missing they may or may not call</text>
  <text start="470.159" dur="5.611">the police we definitely know that many</text>
  <text start="473.219" dur="4.2">of them are not reporting the kids to</text>
  <text start="475.77" dur="3.57">the National Center for Missing and</text>
  <text start="477.419" dur="4.141">Exploited Children which is a</text>
  <text start="479.34" dur="5.189">requirement by law in the United States</text>
  <text start="481.56" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s been on the books since 2014 that</text>
  <text start="484.529" dur="4.411">that is actually the job of the social</text>
  <text start="486.63" dur="4.71">worker even I let&amp;#39;s say one of my</text>
  <text start="488.94" dur="4.289">children was in foster care tomorrow my</text>
  <text start="491.34" dur="3.72">kids are grown up but let&amp;#39;s say one of</text>
  <text start="493.229" dur="3.69">my kids was in foster care tomorrow and</text>
  <text start="495.06" dur="4.62">I became aware that they went missing</text>
  <text start="496.919" dur="4.56">from care I can&amp;#39;t call the National</text>
  <text start="499.68" dur="3.739">Center because I am NOT their legal</text>
  <text start="501.479" dur="5.24">guardian it has to be the legal guardian</text>
  <text start="503.419" dur="6.97">so children will go missing for weeks</text>
  <text start="506.719" dur="5.74">months years and never get reported and</text>
  <text start="510.389" dur="4.471">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s easy to track I mean we</text>
  <text start="512.459" dur="4.95">can see it&amp;#39;s happening all you have to</text>
  <text start="514.86" dur="5.549">do is Google like Kentucky had not</text>
  <text start="517.409" dur="6.51">Kentucky can&amp;#39;t decide 81 kids missing at</text>
  <text start="520.409" dur="6.631">one point when that report hit the the</text>
  <text start="523.919" dur="4.201">wires I went on the National Center</text>
  <text start="527.04" dur="3.18">sight to see</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="4.29">if they were at least 81 kids listed</text>
  <text start="530.22" dur="5.49">there it was something like 28 kids</text>
  <text start="532.41" dur="7.61">missing 81 are missing 28 on the site</text>
  <text start="535.71" dur="6.09">and maybe none of those are foster kids</text>
  <text start="540.02" dur="6.4">what a mess</text>
  <text start="541.8" dur="6.84">what a mess a solvable mess yeah so so</text>
  <text start="546.42" dur="4.919">talk about some of the solutions that</text>
  <text start="548.64" dur="4.889">that you&amp;#39;re promoting to help with this</text>
  <text start="551.339" dur="3.721">well look what we&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="553.529" dur="3.391">we&amp;#39;re on Zune</text>
  <text start="555.06" dur="3.99">I can see you I know you&amp;#39;re in your</text>
  <text start="556.92" dur="5.1">house or your studio you know I&amp;#39;m in my</text>
  <text start="559.05" dur="5.25">house or my studio think about a</text>
  <text start="562.02" dur="5.73">caseworker who&amp;#39;s supposed to be checking</text>
  <text start="564.3" dur="6.479">on however many kids they have under</text>
  <text start="567.75" dur="3.81">their their care before we disperse a</text>
  <text start="570.779" dur="4.171">check</text>
  <text start="571.56" dur="5.969">it&amp;#39;s a zoom and it&amp;#39;s recorded it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="574.95" dur="4.05">two problems one you physically see that</text>
  <text start="577.529" dur="3.901">the child is where they&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="579" dur="5.88">be with who they&amp;#39;re supposed to be with</text>
  <text start="581.43" dur="6.3">and if the child does go missing now I</text>
  <text start="584.88" dur="4.74">have an image that&amp;#39;s current so that</text>
  <text start="587.73" dur="5.22">when I do have to report them missing</text>
  <text start="589.62" dur="5.28">there&amp;#39;s a missing poster with an image</text>
  <text start="592.95" dur="3.72">that allows us as the public to be able</text>
  <text start="594.9" dur="4.92">to look for these kids and bring them</text>
  <text start="596.67" dur="6.39">back we&amp;#39;ll bring them to safety so</text>
  <text start="599.82" dur="6.269">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s number one we also want a</text>
  <text start="603.06" dur="6">complete inventory we want a complete</text>
  <text start="606.089" dur="4.921">head count that happens this way so that</text>
  <text start="609.06" dur="4.38">we have documentation for all these kids</text>
  <text start="611.01" dur="6.12">so that we know who&amp;#39;s missing now and</text>

  <text start="643.83" dur="6.96">this particular day it&amp;#39;s not there and I</text>
  <text start="648.12" dur="5.06">also feel that holding the social</text>
  <text start="650.79" dur="4.56">workers responsible the ones that aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="653.18" dur="4.59">reporting the children where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="655.35" dur="3.57">supposed to be reporting them as missing</text>
  <text start="657.77" dur="3.999">they</text>
  <text start="658.92" dur="6.029">they don&amp;#39;t have any any accountability</text>
  <text start="661.769" dur="6.3">there they&amp;#39;re like a protected class and</text>
  <text start="664.949" dur="6.961">that&amp;#39;s wrong because they are in charge</text>
  <text start="668.069" dur="7.37">of our most valuable important resource</text>
  <text start="671.91" dur="6.44">which is youth and our future absolutely</text>
  <text start="675.439" dur="5.83">absolutely and I would think too that</text>
  <text start="678.35" dur="6.489">this tightened accountability would</text>
  <text start="681.269" dur="5.82">discourage potential foster parents who</text>
  <text start="684.839" dur="4.08">would be abusive from even wanting to</text>
  <text start="687.089" dur="4.59">become foster parents so it kind of</text>
  <text start="688.919" dur="5.07">works I mean that I would hope that that</text>
  <text start="691.679" dur="4.231">would be one of the results as well yeah</text>
  <text start="693.989" dur="4.35">I would definitely hope that would be</text>
  <text start="695.91" dur="5.219">one of the results another I mean</text>
  <text start="698.339" dur="4.29">somebody who who is a foster parent and</text>
  <text start="701.129" dur="3.87">not reporting a child missing and</text>
  <text start="702.629" dur="5.73">collecting a check or the group homes</text>
  <text start="704.999" dur="5.31">particularly the for-profit homes it</text>
  <text start="708.359" dur="3.63">would be a great deterrent in stopping</text>
  <text start="710.309" dur="3.95">them from doing that so you would also</text>
  <text start="711.989" dur="4.95">hopefully be weeding out a particular</text>
  <text start="714.259" dur="5.68">personality that&amp;#39;s given to you know</text>
  <text start="716.939" dur="5.82">illegal and fraudulent behavior right so</text>
  <text start="719.939" dur="5.25">that that&amp;#39;s definitely something that</text>
  <text start="722.759" dur="4.29">would help with that and and on on the</text>
  <text start="725.189" dur="3.93">other side of it you know that the money</text>
  <text start="727.049" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s being spent for kids that aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="729.119" dur="5.791">there that could be being spent for</text>
  <text start="731.939" dur="4.98">improving the foster care system and</text>
  <text start="734.91" dur="5.219">improving the care of these kids</text>
  <text start="736.919" dur="5.46">you know if I called tomorrow this this</text>
  <text start="740.129" dur="4.5">is the crazy part of the crazy part to</text>
  <text start="742.379" dur="4.44">me if you called tomorrow I always say</text>
  <text start="744.629" dur="4.95">this you called any called the IRS and</text>
  <text start="746.819" dur="5.58">said hey you know I can&amp;#39;t find my tax</text>
  <text start="749.579" dur="4.8">return from last year can you tell me</text>
  <text start="752.399" dur="3.72">how much I paid in taxes they can tell</text>
  <text start="754.379" dur="3.15">you down to the penny and if it turns</text>
  <text start="756.119" dur="2.851">out you owed a little money they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="757.529" dur="5.84">able to tell you that right then and</text>
  <text start="758.97" dur="8.219">there to call tomorrow call any state</text>
  <text start="763.369" dur="6.43">child welfare agency call the the</text>
  <text start="767.189" dur="4.83">governing body for all of child welfare</text>
  <text start="769.799" dur="5.13">and ask them how many kids are missing</text>
  <text start="772.019" dur="5.67">the response you&amp;#39;re gonna get is we</text>
  <text start="774.929" dur="4.58">estimate 1% of the total number of</text>
  <text start="777.689" dur="4.71">children in care go missing every year</text>
  <text start="779.509" dur="4.27">that&amp;#39;s how we got the 4600 number</text>
  <text start="782.399" dur="3.21">because that year there were four</text>
  <text start="783.779" dur="5.22">hundred and sixty thousand kids in care</text>
  <text start="785.609" dur="5.64">they can&amp;#39;t tell you exactly how many</text>
  <text start="788.999" dur="3.181">little human beings are missing and</text>
  <text start="791.249" dur="3.511">what&amp;#39;s happened</text>
  <text start="792.18" dur="4.5">to them and then if you hold their hand</text>
  <text start="794.76" dur="4.17">to the fire they go well we think they</text>
  <text start="796.68" dur="4.95">just ran home oh you mean the home you</text>
  <text start="798.93" dur="7.77">took them from so you&amp;#39;re just not going</text>
  <text start="801.63" dur="7.47">to look for them and beyond that there</text>
  <text start="806.7" dur="5.13">was a report done out of a reporter Eric</text>
  <text start="809.1" dur="6.12">Rasmussen out of Boston he did he did a</text>
  <text start="811.83" dur="6.93">big big investigative report and he</text>
  <text start="815.22" dur="6.48">found that 110,000 cases of missing</text>
  <text start="818.76" dur="5.1">foster children from the year 2000 to</text>
  <text start="821.7" dur="4.19">now have been closed without finding the</text>
  <text start="823.86" dur="7.59">kids don&amp;#39;t know what happened to them</text>
  <text start="825.89" dur="8.43">hon 110,000 that we know of and yet</text>
  <text start="831.45" dur="6.69">nobody wants to grab on to this story</text>
  <text start="834.32" dur="6.639">nobody you know you look at this when</text>
  <text start="838.14" dur="4.92">when all of these kids were separated at</text>
  <text start="840.959" dur="5.431">the border which is absolutely horrific</text>
  <text start="843.06" dur="5.279">and the hash tag was where the children</text>
  <text start="846.39" dur="5.16">well we actually knew where those kids</text>
  <text start="848.339" dur="5.281">were what about all the kids that were</text>
  <text start="851.55" dur="3.81">already missing have been missing and</text>
  <text start="853.62" dur="3.99">continue to go missing every week</text>
  <text start="855.36" dur="4.86">where&amp;#39;s the hash tag for that where&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="857.61" dur="5.46">the media all over that where are the</text>
  <text start="860.22" dur="5.79">politicians all over that to make change</text>
  <text start="863.07" dur="4.59">in their own states nowhere and they</text>
  <text start="866.01" dur="4.079">know what&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s impossible</text>
  <text start="867.66" dur="5.82">that they don&amp;#39;t right right absolutely</text>
  <text start="870.089" dur="5.25">so talk a little bit about this petition</text>
  <text start="873.48" dur="4.41">that you have going right now</text>
  <text start="875.339" dur="5.431">so the petition that we have going right</text>
  <text start="877.89" dur="4.5">now is basically to make the changes</text>
  <text start="880.77" dur="4.74">that that I was telling you about</text>
  <text start="882.39" dur="7.889">earlier one being a complete inventory</text>
  <text start="885.51" dur="6.99">in the system so that we know what our</text>
  <text start="890.279" dur="6.991">actual real life headcount</text>
  <text start="892.5" dur="7.11">is another is that prior to a check</text>
  <text start="897.27" dur="5.069">being dispersed either to a foster</text>
  <text start="899.61" dur="6.06">family or a group home they have to</text>
  <text start="902.339" dur="6.24">present the child by video that can be</text>
  <text start="905.67" dur="6">documented by the caseworkers no video</text>
  <text start="908.579" dur="6.241">no check if the child isn&amp;#39;t available</text>
  <text start="911.67" dur="5.33">within 24 hours then the social worker</text>
  <text start="914.82" dur="5.25">needs to assume that they&amp;#39;re missing</text>
  <text start="917" dur="6.279">make a report to the police as required</text>
  <text start="920.07" dur="5.37">by the bylaw and the police then we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="923.279" dur="4.081">have them entered into the FBI</text>
  <text start="925.44" dur="4.649">database they have two hours to do that</text>
  <text start="927.36" dur="4.86">also required by law and then the social</text>
  <text start="930.089" dur="4.92">worker is further required to</text>
  <text start="932.22" dur="4.58">immediately contact the National Center</text>
  <text start="935.009" dur="4.56">for Missing and Exploited Children</text>
  <text start="936.8" dur="5.409">providing all of the details surrounding</text>
  <text start="939.569" dur="5.431">the disappearance and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="942.209" dur="5.13">calling to have happen I mean it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="945" dur="5.37">rocket science we&amp;#39;re in it we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="947.339" dur="6.451">data-driven age and you can&amp;#39;t tell me</text>
  <text start="950.37" dur="6.509">these kids are missing or how many right</text>
  <text start="953.79" dur="4.789">right absolutely yeah and I mean it</text>
  <text start="956.879" dur="4.83">seems like such common sense because</text>
  <text start="958.579" dur="4.841">obviously if you place a child in a</text>
  <text start="961.709" dur="4.891">foster family and they&amp;#39;re committing</text>
  <text start="963.42" dur="5.339">abuse and this this child runs away that</text>
  <text start="966.6" dur="3.419">foster family is not gonna report</text>
  <text start="968.759" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re not that I couldn&amp;#39;t want a</text>
  <text start="970.019" dur="6.541">report they&amp;#39;re gonna want this covered</text>
  <text start="972.089" dur="6.24">up so the social workers that are</text>
  <text start="976.56" dur="3.959">working within the foster care system I</text>
  <text start="978.329" dur="4.771">mean is this just a case of the them</text>
  <text start="980.519" dur="5.341">being overburdened or or do you suspect</text>
  <text start="983.1" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s some other things going on um I</text>
  <text start="985.86" dur="4.649">think some of it is overburdened for</text>
  <text start="988.56" dur="3.81">certain I mean from what I hear and</text>
  <text start="990.509" dur="5.041">having never been a social worker or</text>
  <text start="992.37" dur="6.18">walked a mile in their shoes that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="995.55" dur="7.17">what I know from you know second-hand</text>
  <text start="998.55" dur="6.57">knowledge I also think that when you</text>
  <text start="1002.72" dur="4.619">have children like I was that are</text>
  <text start="1005.12" dur="4.079">habitually running because some of these</text>
  <text start="1007.339" dur="4.951">kids that run do return or they get</text>
  <text start="1009.199" dur="5.791">found fairly quickly and returned back</text>
  <text start="1012.29" dur="6.239">to the home there&amp;#39;s this idea and law</text>
  <text start="1014.99" dur="6.38">enforcement also perpetuates the same</text>
  <text start="1018.529" dur="6.121">idea that most of them will just turn up</text>
  <text start="1021.37" dur="6.219">so there&amp;#39;s kind of this this feeling of</text>
  <text start="1024.65" dur="6.389">a lack of urgency that definitely should</text>
  <text start="1027.589" dur="7.021">not exist that does I read something the</text>
  <text start="1031.039" dur="5.28">other day that said seventy seventy</text>
  <text start="1034.61" dur="4.049">percent of kids who run away from home</text>
  <text start="1036.319" dur="4.951">will just return on their own I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1038.659" dur="4.591">know how accurate that number is but</text>
  <text start="1041.27" dur="4.319">let&amp;#39;s just say it is accurate for</text>
  <text start="1043.25" dur="5.659">argument&amp;#39;s sake what about the other</text>
  <text start="1045.589" dur="6.811">three kids the other three out of ten</text>
  <text start="1048.909" dur="6.161">you can&amp;#39;t work on these assumptions we</text>
  <text start="1052.4" dur="4.83">know that within the first two to 48</text>
  <text start="1055.07" dur="4.22">hours of a child being on the streets a</text>
  <text start="1057.23" dur="4.28">predator or somebody who wants</text>
  <text start="1059.29" dur="4.14">to exploit them we&amp;#39;ll approach them this</text>
  <text start="1061.51" dur="3.39">is a this is a statistic from the</text>

  <text start="1235.5" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re just screaming for attention she</text>
  <text start="1237.51" dur="4.68">just wants attention and what what law</text>
  <text start="1240.36" dur="4.89">enforcement was doing at the time and</text>
  <text start="1242.19" dur="5.01">and I they still used the term chronic</text>
  <text start="1245.25" dur="4.8">runaway or they labeled me a habitual</text>
  <text start="1247.2" dur="5.28">runaway so it really just solidified</text>
  <text start="1250.05" dur="4.95">that I was a problem child and here was</text>
  <text start="1252.48" dur="4.74">my mother on the other end going woe is</text>
  <text start="1255" dur="3.54">me look I have this kid I can&amp;#39;t deal</text>
  <text start="1257.22" dur="5.19">with her I don&amp;#39;t know what to do with</text>
  <text start="1258.54" dur="6.09">her nobody was really going okay what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1262.41" dur="6.06">happening here what would make a person</text>
  <text start="1264.63" dur="7.5">a child leave a house with a bed a</text>
  <text start="1268.47" dur="6.6">bathroom three meals a day and continue</text>
  <text start="1272.13" dur="5.94">to try to be on the streets anywhere but</text>
  <text start="1275.07" dur="5.07">in that home and the reason that I do</text>
  <text start="1278.07" dur="4.5">what I&amp;#39;m doing now is because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1280.14" dur="6.24">still not asking those questions we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1282.57" dur="5.39">still we have not caught up with all of</text>
  <text start="1286.38" dur="3.93">the awareness that we have</text>
  <text start="1287.96" dur="5.02">psychologically with with everything</text>
  <text start="1290.31" dur="4.95">that we hear and know about abuse we</text>
  <text start="1292.98" dur="5.07">still haven&amp;#39;t caught up with the part</text>
  <text start="1295.26" dur="6">that nobody would choose to live on a</text>
  <text start="1298.05" dur="6.27">park bench over a home if the home</text>
  <text start="1301.26" dur="6.03">wasn&amp;#39;t riddled with some sort of issue</text>
  <text start="1304.32" dur="6.17">and in my case it was all three types of</text>
  <text start="1307.29" dur="6.39">abuse physical emotional and sexual</text>
  <text start="1310.49" dur="5.32">almost eighty percent of kids who run</text>
  <text start="1313.68" dur="5.28">away from home are experiencing one of</text>
  <text start="1315.81" dur="6.33">those three if not all three and we need</text>
  <text start="1318.96" dur="5.46">to intervene and and it can be done if I</text>
  <text start="1322.14" dur="3.93">had had someone to go to if I had a soft</text>
  <text start="1324.42" dur="2.91">place to fall I</text>
  <text start="1326.07" dur="3.21">would have been able to stick it out</text>
  <text start="1327.33" dur="5.1">even if I had been stuck in that house</text>
  <text start="1329.28" dur="6.45">if I had somebody who was softening</text>
  <text start="1332.43" dur="7.02">those lows I would have stuck it out but</text>
  <text start="1335.73" dur="7.25">I had nobody and nobody was asking right</text>
  <text start="1339.45" dur="6.24">right yeah there&amp;#39;s definitely a stigma</text>
  <text start="1342.98" dur="4.99">against Runaways that that ought not to</text>
  <text start="1345.69" dur="5.01">be there and yeah very very good that we</text>
  <text start="1347.97" dur="6.12">should be asking us those questions so</text>
  <text start="1350.7" dur="6.87">how long have you been involved in in</text>
  <text start="1354.09" dur="6.75">doing what you&amp;#39;re doing now I wrote my</text>
  <text start="1357.57" dur="4.98">book four years ago published three</text>
  <text start="1360.84" dur="9.18">years ago so it&amp;#39;s been about three years</text>
  <text start="1362.55" dur="9.81">now and when I when I began resource for</text>
  <text start="1370.02" dur="5.21">recovering Runaways there was nothing</text>
  <text start="1372.36" dur="5.7">out there for me and I&amp;#39;d always wanted</text>
  <text start="1375.23" dur="5.5">something to connect to and that was my</text>
  <text start="1378.06" dur="4.77">original intention and that&amp;#39;s also how I</text>
  <text start="1380.73" dur="5.37">ended up finding you know that the</text>
  <text start="1382.83" dur="5.54">stigma is is alive and well and still</text>
  <text start="1386.1" dur="5.73">just as bad as it was when I was a kid</text>
  <text start="1388.37" dur="4.69">right okay so in the past three or four</text>
  <text start="1391.83" dur="4.86">years that you&amp;#39;ve been doing this</text>
  <text start="1393.06" dur="8.45">have you seen positive changes that that</text>
  <text start="1396.69" dur="7.41">have been brought about or I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1401.51" dur="5.41">personally I&amp;#39;ve experienced positive</text>
  <text start="1404.1" dur="4.89">changes just from individuals you know</text>
  <text start="1406.92" dur="4.38">person to person and and that sort of</text>
  <text start="1408.99" dur="4.77">ripple effect where somebody will say to</text>
  <text start="1411.3" dur="5.45">me I had no idea that was going on and</text>
  <text start="1413.76" dur="6.96">they share it forward with other people</text>
  <text start="1416.75" dur="6.01">I&amp;#39;ve seen more people around me</text>
  <text start="1420.72" dur="5.1">personally being involved just with</text>
  <text start="1422.76" dur="6.48">homelessness in general because we we</text>
  <text start="1425.82" dur="6.27">have this idea that it won&amp;#39;t happen to</text>
  <text start="1429.24" dur="4.74">me you know or we we have a tendency</text>
  <text start="1432.09" dur="3.69">want to walk around people who are</text>
  <text start="1433.98" dur="3.6">experiencing homelessness because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1435.78" dur="4.05">afraid it will happen to me kind of</text>
  <text start="1437.58" dur="4.29">thing and the fact is that each and</text>
  <text start="1439.83" dur="4.35">every one of us is vulnerable because a</text>
  <text start="1441.87" dur="4.8">lot of people who end up on the streets</text>
  <text start="1444.18" dur="6.21">end up out there because of a traumatic</text>
  <text start="1446.67" dur="7.41">situation so so yeah I have seen some</text>
  <text start="1450.39" dur="5.79">progress in that area not as much as I</text>
  <text start="1454.08" dur="5.16">would like to see but I&amp;#39;m one person in</text>

  <text start="1616.95" dur="3.75">just let you talk about anything that</text>
  <text start="1618.81" dur="4.23">maybe I haven&amp;#39;t touched upon or asked</text>
  <text start="1620.7" dur="6.72">you about that you want to make sure you</text>
  <text start="1623.04" dur="5.79">communicate to to my subscribers well I</text>
  <text start="1627.42" dur="4.89">think the only thing I haven&amp;#39;t touched</text>
  <text start="1628.83" dur="6.06">upon is what to do if you know of a kid</text>
  <text start="1632.31" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s running and it&amp;#39;s not just a</text>
  <text start="1634.89" dur="4.35">matter of saying hey why are you running</text>
  <text start="1637.44" dur="5.31">people did ask me that law enforcement</text>
  <text start="1639.24" dur="5.7">in particular and there&amp;#39;s a couple of</text>
  <text start="1642.75" dur="5.28">issues with that one is when you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="1644.94" dur="4.86">child being abused that&amp;#39;s your normal so</text>
  <text start="1648.03" dur="3.63">if somebody said to me are you being</text>
  <text start="1649.8" dur="3.63">abused at home I would have said no</text>
  <text start="1651.66" dur="5.37">because I didn&amp;#39;t know that wasn&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="1653.43" dur="6.6">on in everybody else&amp;#39;s house if somebody</text>
  <text start="1657.03" dur="5.28">had asked me and identified with me hey</text>
  <text start="1660.03" dur="5.1">I I know you must be running for a</text>
  <text start="1662.31" dur="5.97">reason do you want to talk about it can</text>
  <text start="1665.13" dur="5.76">you tell me what it is that that it is</text>
  <text start="1668.28" dur="5.19">causing you this stress I would have</text>
  <text start="1670.89" dur="5.01">been more apt to answer those questions</text>
  <text start="1673.47" dur="5.64">there were teachers that I trusted who</text>
  <text start="1675.9" dur="6.12">would have been able to do that so we</text>
  <text start="1679.11" dur="4.47">need to be we need to be proactive and</text>
  <text start="1682.02" dur="3.81">we need to intervene we need to get</text>
  <text start="1683.58" dur="4.98">involved these children are all of our</text>
  <text start="1685.83" dur="4.11">children and the other thing is if you</text>
  <text start="1688.56" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t know what to do</text>
  <text start="1689.94" dur="5.73">I would contact Covenant House they are</text>
  <text start="1693.57" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;ve been around for four years there</text>
  <text start="1695.67" dur="6">are 30 of them in the US alone I believe</text>
  <text start="1698.67" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s 31 in total and they have</text>
  <text start="1701.67" dur="4.83">resources they have resources to give</text>
  <text start="1704.07" dur="4.68">you information on what you can do as a</text>
  <text start="1706.5" dur="4.59">person trying to intervene they have</text>
  <text start="1708.75" dur="5.01">resources for those children even if</text>
  <text start="1711.09" dur="6.23">there&amp;#39;s not an actual Covenant House in</text>
  <text start="1713.76" dur="6.71">your area they can help refer the child</text>
  <text start="1717.32" dur="5.069">somewhere where they can run to instead</text>
  <text start="1720.47" dur="4.319">of ending up on the streets that you</text>
  <text start="1722.389" dur="4.591">know the house may not be safe let&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="1724.789" dur="4.38">them somewhere that is so that that</text>
  <text start="1726.98" dur="4.079">would really be my my parting thought is</text>
  <text start="1729.169" dur="4.38">just to remember that these kids are</text>
  <text start="1731.059" dur="5.49">calling for help not attention and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1733.549" dur="5.551">our job to help them absolutely yeah I</text>
  <text start="1736.549" dur="3.87">think things have really really gotten</text>
  <text start="1739.1" dur="3.539">backwards it particularly here in the</text>
  <text start="1740.419" dur="4.051">United States I&amp;#39;m not as familiar with</text>
  <text start="1742.639" dur="3.78">what&amp;#39;s going on in Canada or Europe but</text>
  <text start="1744.47" dur="3.98">I know here in the United States I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1746.419" dur="5.46">even interviewed a number of people who</text>
  <text start="1748.45" dur="4.87">you know they they get their children</text>
  <text start="1751.879" dur="3.75">taken from them because of just some</text>
  <text start="1753.32" dur="4.29">random anonymous phone call right and</text>
  <text start="1755.629" dur="3.18">and there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong going on these</text>
  <text start="1757.61" dur="3.39">kids are not running away there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1758.809" dur="4.561">abuse going on and yet we&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="1761" dur="3.99">down on this other side where when there</text>
  <text start="1763.37" dur="3.269">is legitimate abuse where the children</text>
  <text start="1764.99" dur="4.529">are running away nothing&amp;#39;s being done</text>
  <text start="1766.639" dur="6.9">and it just it&amp;#39;s so frustrating because</text>
  <text start="1769.519" dur="6.061">because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s the whole</text>

  <text start="1782.36" dur="2.37">seems like they&amp;#39;re ripping apart</text>

  <text start="1810.74" dur="5.13">you can&amp;#39;t reward them with money for the</text>

  <text start="1842.629" dur="3.871">thing is too a lot of people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1844.399" dur="4.861">realize the piece really suspect the</text>
  <text start="1846.5" dur="4.059">child just being abused CPS is not who</text>
  <text start="1849.26" dur="2.95">you call you call</text>
  <text start="1850.559" dur="4.791">the police because the police are</text>
  <text start="1852.21" dur="6.99">actually who they&amp;#39;re trained to</text>
  <text start="1855.35" dur="7.149">investigate abuse CPS is trained to</text>
  <text start="1859.2" dur="6.929">remove children and place them not the</text>
  <text start="1862.499" dur="5.31">other way around right right but I</text>
  <text start="1866.129" dur="3.66">didn&amp;#39;t realize that that was something</text>
  <text start="1867.809" dur="4.141">that I have learned in the last three</text>
  <text start="1869.789" dur="4.14">years I never knew that if I knew a</text>
  <text start="1871.95" dur="4.29">child was in danger I would have called</text>
  <text start="1873.929" dur="3.511">CPS it&amp;#39;s not who were supposed to call</text>
  <text start="1876.24" dur="3.09">we&amp;#39;re supposed to be calling the police</text>
  <text start="1877.44" dur="4.709">department because they are the</text>
  <text start="1879.33" dur="3.87">investigators right right well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1882.149" dur="3.061">that&amp;#39;s very good to know</text>
  <text start="1883.2" dur="4.5">very good to know yeah and and I totally</text>
  <text start="1885.21" dur="3.959">agree with you that the fact that CPS</text>
  <text start="1887.7" dur="4.469">and the foster system that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1889.169" dur="4.61">getting subsidized by the government for</text>
  <text start="1892.169" dur="5.071">how many children they take it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1893.779" dur="5.321">what are we doing what are we doing and</text>
  <text start="1897.24" dur="2.429">they pay more for kids who are being</text>
  <text start="1899.1" dur="3.72">drugged</text>
  <text start="1899.669" dur="4.98">so there&amp;#39;s another incentive so if you</text>
  <text start="1902.82" dur="4.979">have a child who&amp;#39;s on any psychiatric</text>
  <text start="1904.649" dur="6.12">drugs it&amp;#39;s a higher rate of pay and I</text>
  <text start="1907.799" dur="4.86">would venture to bet that if you looked</text>
  <text start="1910.769" dur="4.561">at any group home that&amp;#39;s a for-profit</text>
  <text start="1912.659" dur="5.191">home I bet you that most of the kids</text>
  <text start="1915.33" dur="5.49">that they have are on medication and</text>
  <text start="1917.85" dur="5.399">went on medication in those homes</text>
  <text start="1920.82" dur="7.319">because it&amp;#39;s a significantly higher</text>
  <text start="1923.249" dur="9.211">paycheck that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s even more</text>
  <text start="1928.139" dur="6.811">disturbing as I I mean I&amp;#39;m pretty much</text>
  <text start="1932.46" dur="5.37">opposed to a lot of these medications I</text>
  <text start="1934.95" dur="5.819">think that they&amp;#39;re a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="1937.83" dur="4.62">Wow and I really just want to highlight</text>
  <text start="1940.769" dur="3.27">to my audience again the point that she</text>
  <text start="1942.45" dur="3">made toward the beginning of the video</text>
  <text start="1944.039" dur="4.77">which I think we need to remember is</text>
  <text start="1945.45" dur="7.229">that it&amp;#39;s really really backwards that</text>
  <text start="1948.809" dur="5.82">the IRS will keep meticulous records of</text>
  <text start="1952.679" dur="4.32">how much money we may owe them or how</text>
  <text start="1954.629" dur="5.731">much money we paid and yet with our own</text>
  <text start="1956.999" dur="4.56">children these government agencies can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1960.36" dur="4.439">tell you how many children are missing</text>
  <text start="1961.559" dur="5.661">they have they have no idea really this</text>
  <text start="1964.799" dur="4.86">this this is a reflection of our</text>
  <text start="1967.22" dur="4.6">government of our culture and why we</text>
  <text start="1969.659" dur="4.86">really really really really need to be</text>
  <text start="1971.82" dur="4.439">raising our voice about these issues and</text>
  <text start="1974.519" dur="3.24">and like what Marnie&amp;#39;s suggesting we</text>
  <text start="1976.259" dur="3.931">need to be calling a representatives we</text>
  <text start="1977.759" dur="3.721">need to be active in doing this not just</text>
  <text start="1980.19" dur="3.329">saying oh well this is a problem you</text>
  <text start="1981.48" dur="3.06">know that&amp;#39;s horrible no we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1983.519" dur="4.651">to be a</text>
  <text start="1984.54" dur="5.58">because we cannot continue to live in a</text>
  <text start="1988.17" dur="6.09">culture that treats our children this</text>
  <text start="1990.12" dur="5.93">way it&amp;#39;s just it doesn&amp;#39;t work and and we</text>
