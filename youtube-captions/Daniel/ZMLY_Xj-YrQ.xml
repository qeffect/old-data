  <text start="111.96" dur="6.689">of 2014 and fall of 2017 you need to</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="4.769">read revelation 12 it&amp;#39;s right there the</text>
  <text start="118.649" dur="4.421">woman flees into the wilderness and</text>
  <text start="120.329" dur="4.9">she&amp;#39;s protected for 1260 days</text>
  <text start="123.07" dur="4.98">now how do you become part of that woman</text>
  <text start="125.229" dur="6.48">well I&amp;#39;ve been that&amp;#39;s what my 12</text>
  <text start="128.05" dur="5.25">messages 144,000 are all about that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.709" dur="2.941">what a lot of the podcast I&amp;#39;ve made</text>
  <text start="133.3" dur="3.54">about you know like the characteristics</text>
  <text start="134.65" dur="3.57">of Philadelphia and praying for those</text>
  <text start="136.84" dur="3.99">characteristics in your life that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="138.22" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s all about the ceiling of 144,000</text>
  <text start="140.83" dur="3.6">the one I made back on october six if</text>
  <text start="142.6" dur="3.27">you go to my youtube channel you go back</text>

  <text start="145.87" dur="4.589">my website you&amp;#39;ll see it there that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.69" dur="3.81">what I&amp;#39;ve been trying to reach out to</text>
  <text start="150.459" dur="3.901">people and say look you don&amp;#39;t have to be</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="5.37">a martyr you don&amp;#39;t have to be left</text>
  <text start="154.36" dur="6.51">behind you can be part of the woman that</text>
  <text start="157.87" dur="4.71">flees into the wilderness given wings</text>
  <text start="160.87" dur="4.05">like an eagle and yeah the dragon tries</text>
  <text start="162.58" dur="4.95">to chase her but ultimately the dragon</text>
  <text start="164.92" dur="4.08">fails he casts water out of his mouth</text>
  <text start="167.53" dur="3.06">and the earth helps the woman by</text>
  <text start="169" dur="4.23">swallowing the water and the earth and</text>
  <text start="170.59" dur="4.05">the woman escapes and is in the safe</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="4.8">place for you know three and a half</text>
  <text start="174.64" dur="6.39">years so it&amp;#39;s not arrogant to want</text>
  <text start="178.03" dur="5.76">something that Yahshua himself commands</text>
  <text start="181.03" dur="4.56">us to pray now who will be the martyrs</text>

  <text start="189.67" dur="4.71">not pressing in they&amp;#39;re not living holy</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="5.589">but those who are sincerely in love with</text>
  <text start="194.38" dur="4.26">Yahshua you are pressing in to the</text>
  <text start="196.989" dur="3.09">Messiah with everything in you you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="198.64" dur="2.819">loving him with all your heart soul mind</text>

  <text start="201.459" dur="5.641">neighbors yourself and you&amp;#39;re continuing</text>
  <text start="203.38" dur="5.79">to press into him on a daily basis those</text>
  <text start="207.1" dur="4.02">are the people they&amp;#39;re going to be part</text>
  <text start="209.17" dur="4.44">of Philadelphia the the congregation of</text>
  <text start="211.12" dur="4.26">brotherly love and will be caught into</text>
  <text start="213.61" dur="3.599">the safe place what are the</text>
  <text start="215.38" dur="3.3">characteristics of Philadelphia I listed</text>
  <text start="217.209" dur="4.62">this in a previous video several weeks</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="5.61">ago it says the key of David David was a</text>
  <text start="221.829" dur="4.081">man after yaso and heart so it&amp;#39;s having</text>
  <text start="224.29" dur="4.89">that heart that&amp;#39;s just totally sold out</text>
  <text start="225.91" dur="5.52">to Yahshua to Jesus it&amp;#39;s he that is holy</text>
  <text start="229.18" dur="6.66">its living sinless living without sin</text>
  <text start="231.43" dur="5.94">living pure first John 362 11 we&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="235.84" dur="4.2">when Jesus tells the woman caught in</text>
  <text start="237.37" dur="4.5">adultery go and sin no more it&amp;#39;s tasting</text>
  <text start="240.04" dur="4.789">that verse living its breathing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.87" dur="6.78">Matthew 548 be perfect as I am perfect</text>
  <text start="244.829" dur="6.13">how by loving your enemies by trusting</text>
  <text start="248.65" dur="4.839">in him on a moment-by-moment daily basis</text>
  <text start="250.959" dur="5.75">to live holy to live without sin</text>
  <text start="253.489" dur="4.511">so it&amp;#39;s not arrogant to say that I&amp;#39;m one</text>
  <text start="256.709" dur="2.641">of the hundred forty four thousand or</text>
  <text start="258" dur="4.109">that I&amp;#39;m part of the woman it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="4.44">arrogant for you to say that you it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="262.109" dur="4.411">promise that you can grab ahold of and</text>
  <text start="263.79" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s what people don&amp;#39;t understand you</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="4.44">know Jacob when he wrestled with that</text>
  <text start="268.44" dur="4.53">angel back in the Tanakh which was</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="5.929">literally that angel was Yahshua by the</text>

  <text start="276.889" dur="6.041">wrestling with him all night and it</text>
  <text start="279.6" dur="6.629">refuses to let Yahshua go until he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="5.43">blessed and eventually the the fight</text>
  <text start="286.229" dur="6.991">gets so desperate lasts all night that</text>
  <text start="288.36" dur="6.84">by by morning by dawn you know Jacob as</text>
  <text start="293.22" dur="5.34">he&amp;#39;s refusing to let Yahshua go on the</text>
