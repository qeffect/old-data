  <text start="130.64" dur="4.14">to Seattle next week I was thinking yeah</text>
  <text start="132.86" dur="3.54">about it and and felt like he had told</text>
  <text start="134.78" dur="3.12">me to do it and I was sort of like okay</text>
  <text start="136.4" dur="3.63">I wonder why he&amp;#39;s sending me down to</text>
  <text start="137.9" dur="3.809">Seattle didn&amp;#39;t quite understand but you</text>
  <text start="140.03" dur="4.11">know when God tells you to do something</text>
  <text start="141.709" dur="4.351">you don&amp;#39;t seek to fully understand his</text>
  <text start="144.14" dur="3.15">will you just obey it and when you obey</text>
  <text start="146.06" dur="4.35">his will then he&amp;#39;ll start revealing</text>
  <text start="147.29" dur="5.94">things to you and shortly after I just</text>
  <text start="150.41" dur="4.77">sort of obeyed and spent the money to to</text>
  <text start="153.23" dur="3.839">go down there I&amp;#39;ll be down there the</text>
  <text start="155.18" dur="5.85">next four or five days flying down</text>
  <text start="157.069" dur="6.121">tomorrow things started happening and</text>
  <text start="161.03" dur="3.42">now I thought it&amp;#39;s just gonna be a</text>
  <text start="163.19" dur="2.9">husband and wife and a couple other</text>
  <text start="164.45" dur="4.05">people that I was gonna be meeting with</text>
  <text start="166.09" dur="6.91">in the Seattle area but now it&amp;#39;s turned</text>
  <text start="168.5" dur="9.63">into a group of 14 people we&amp;#39;re meeting</text>
  <text start="173" dur="7.65">at a at a restaurant and really looking</text>
  <text start="178.13" dur="4.079">forward to it just meeting somebody</text>
  <text start="180.65" dur="6.27">like-minded people down in the Seattle</text>
  <text start="182.209" dur="6.661">area and I think she&amp;#39;s gonna be really</text>
  <text start="186.92" dur="4.71">exciting it&amp;#39;s kind of neat what yaw has</text>
  <text start="188.87" dur="6.36">done I&amp;#39;m almost wondering if I need to</text>
  <text start="191.63" dur="6.389">add a sixth pillar to my five pillar</text>
  <text start="195.23" dur="6.27">mission statement that I read in front</text>
  <text start="198.019" dur="5.431">of my videos every time and that sixth</text>
  <text start="201.5" dur="4.59">one being that yaw seems to be sending</text>
  <text start="203.45" dur="4.8">me on these mission trips you know in</text>
  <text start="206.09" dur="3.42">July he sent me out to the White House</text>
  <text start="208.25" dur="3.12">where I preached out in front of the</text>
  <text start="209.51" dur="3.96">White House to encourage President Trump</text>
  <text start="211.37" dur="3.81">and you know was able to sort of be the</text>
  <text start="213.47" dur="5.73">representative for my subscribers at</text>
  <text start="215.18" dur="5.85">that fourth of July rally and then the</text>
  <text start="219.2" dur="5.039">following month in August he sent me out</text>
  <text start="221.03" dur="5.489">to Minnesota so again I could sort of be</text>
  <text start="224.239" dur="4.321">the representative for my subscribers</text>
  <text start="226.519" dur="6.601">and an interview field McConnell and</text>
  <text start="228.56" dur="5.489">just take you into a ground zero view of</text>
  <text start="233.12" dur="3.72">what was going on with that Timothy</text>
  <text start="234.049" dur="5.011">Holmes death trial and then this month</text>
  <text start="236.84" dur="4.019">September seems to be Seattle</text>
  <text start="239.06" dur="4.049">I don&amp;#39;t know fully all that he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="240.859" dur="5.931">have me do in Seattle but but certainly</text>
  <text start="243.109" dur="6.091">this meeting with these 14 subscribers</text>
  <text start="246.79" dur="3.7">seems to be a huge part of it so I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="249.2" dur="3.54">really excited about that</text>
  <text start="250.49" dur="3.96">and so I&amp;#39;m gonna just keep praying</text>
  <text start="252.74" dur="4.08">because I think every month or you know</text>
  <text start="254.45" dur="4.29">at least I mean obviously I could only</text>
  <text start="256.82" dur="4.56">do what what I&amp;#39;m able to afford with my</text>
  <text start="258.74" dur="5.58">finances but but every month or maybe</text>
  <text start="261.38" dur="4.23">every other month or so I&amp;#39;m just gonna</text>
  <text start="264.32" dur="2.61">be praying and asking because I think</text>
  <text start="265.61" dur="4.62">you&amp;#39;re gonna just sort of send me to</text>
  <text start="266.93" dur="4.68">different locations to meet with</text>
  <text start="270.23" dur="2.37">subscribers face to face because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="271.61" dur="4.83">gotten a lot of interest of people</text>
  <text start="272.6" dur="6.39">wanting to do that and also you know I</text>
  <text start="276.44" dur="4.05">get a lot of people saying hey Daniel we</text>
  <text start="278.99" dur="2.88">want to join your prayer group we want</text>
  <text start="280.49" dur="2.61">to join your Zune prayer group we want</text>
  <text start="281.87" dur="4.02">to join your nightly prayer group and</text>
  <text start="283.1" dur="4.14">and you know I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve had hundreds I</text>
  <text start="285.89" dur="4.38">mean literally hundreds of men and women</text>
  <text start="287.24" dur="4.14">over the last few months that have asked</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="3.27">to join my prayer group and I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="291.38" dur="4.71">look guys the Bible says you&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="293.54" dur="4.83">to remain small and multiply you know</text>
  <text start="296.09" dur="3.78">you don&amp;#39;t become this huge mega I could</text>
  <text start="298.37" dur="3.84">probably have a huge mega zoom room if I</text>
  <text start="299.87" dur="4.14">want it but that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not the point</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="3.9">if you remain small and you multiply</text>
  <text start="304.01" dur="3.3">that&amp;#39;s the biblical model and so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="2.82">always encouraged you I said look I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="307.31" dur="3.72">not I&amp;#39;m not adding anyone new to my</text>
  <text start="308.93" dur="4.5">prayer Xoom group but I encourage you to</text>

  <text start="350.95" dur="3.84">the point</text>
  <text start="351.75" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s you know when church has become</text>
  <text start="354.79" dur="4.47">so bloated and big they become</text>
  <text start="356.94" dur="4.69">businesses and they turn inward and</text>
  <text start="359.26" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not no no I&amp;#39;m supposed to</text>
