  <text start="2.909" dur="5.791">with Torah restoration ministries it is</text>
  <text start="5.67" dur="6.75">the evening of October 3rd 2014</text>
  <text start="8.7" dur="8.13">it is Yom Kippur so not only is it the</text>
  <text start="12.42" dur="6.72">weekly Sabbath but this year 2014 the</text>
  <text start="16.83" dur="5.58">high Sabbath Yom Kippur the Day of</text>
  <text start="19.14" dur="5.97">Atonement actually falls on the regular</text>
  <text start="22.41" dur="4.44">weekly Sabbath</text>
  <text start="25.11" dur="4.74">doesn&amp;#39;t happen like that every year but</text>
  <text start="26.85" dur="5.1">this year it does I wanted to start off</text>
  <text start="29.85" dur="4.83">by talking a little bit about that I</text>
  <text start="31.95" dur="6.36">think it&amp;#39;s very interesting that Yom</text>
  <text start="34.68" dur="5.82">Kippur is on the regular weekly Sabbath</text>
  <text start="38.31" dur="4.59">because for those of you who are</text>
  <text start="40.5" dur="4.95">familiar with with what you do on Yom</text>
  <text start="42.9" dur="4.74">Kippur you&amp;#39;re not supposed to eat enough</text>
  <text start="45.45" dur="7.89">just to drink that&amp;#39;s a day of fasting</text>
  <text start="47.64" dur="9.36">and repentance and the weekly Sabbath is</text>
  <text start="53.34" dur="6">typically a day of feasting it&amp;#39;s a day</text>
  <text start="57" dur="5.01">of resting and relaxing and enjoying</text>
  <text start="59.34" dur="5.55">good food and laughter and joy and</text>
  <text start="62.01" dur="5.749">fellowship so the fact that Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="64.89" dur="6.06">the most sober day of the entire</text>
  <text start="67.759" dur="5.831">biblical year a day where we&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="70.95" dur="5.97">to fasts and not have any food or drink</text>
  <text start="73.59" dur="5.4">falls on a day that typically were</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="4.92">supposed to be feasting and enjoying</text>
  <text start="78.99" dur="4.78">ourselves the weekly Sabbath I think is</text>
  <text start="81.84" dur="6.16">prophetically significant</text>
  <text start="83.77" dur="7.949">could it be suggesting that just as this</text>
  <text start="88" dur="5.49">year 2014 were having a day of fasting</text>
  <text start="91.719" dur="4.981">and mourning on a day that&amp;#39;s normally</text>
  <text start="93.49" dur="5.76">set aside for joy and feasting could it</text>
  <text start="96.7" dur="6.39">be significant of us entering into a</text>
  <text start="99.25" dur="7.38">season in which our joy is going to be</text>
  <text start="103.09" dur="4.979">turned into mourning which are dancing</text>
  <text start="106.63" dur="6.29">and our feasting is going to be turned</text>
  <text start="108.069" dur="8.431">to sorrow is that what we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="112.92" dur="4.46">on the worldly scale prophetically</text>
  <text start="116.5" dur="4.99">I think</text>
  <text start="117.38" dur="6.39">the fact that Yom Kippur falls on the</text>
  <text start="121.49" dur="7.17">Shabbat and literally transforms the</text>
  <text start="123.77" dur="9.65">normally joyous festive feast day weekly</text>
  <text start="128.66" dur="7.62">feast day into a sober and serious and</text>
  <text start="133.42" dur="6.49">fasting day I think it&amp;#39;s I think could</text>
  <text start="136.28" dur="8.209">be very prophetic Lisa I want to touch</text>
  <text start="139.91" dur="8.61">upon what Yom Kippur is all about</text>
  <text start="144.489" dur="6">Passover and Yom Kippur are very much</text>
  <text start="148.52" dur="6.42">sort of mirror images of each other</text>
  <text start="150.489" dur="7.421">Passover emphasizes Yas side of</text>
  <text start="154.94" dur="6.71">Atonement Yom Kippur the Day of</text>
  <text start="157.91" dur="6.109">Atonement emphasizes man sound</text>
  <text start="161.65" dur="4.53">one thing I want to make very clear that</text>
  <text start="164.019" dur="3.541">I think is extremely clear all through</text>
  <text start="166.18" dur="4.44">scripture from Genesis through</text>
  <text start="167.56" dur="6.509">revelation is that there are two sides</text>
  <text start="170.62" dur="6.08">to atonement there are two sides to</text>
  <text start="174.069" dur="5.34">redemption there are two sides to</text>
  <text start="176.7" dur="4">turning away from a lifestyle sin and</text>
  <text start="179.409" dur="4.021">entering into the Covenant</text>
  <text start="180.7" dur="5.94">of young one side can only be done by</text>
  <text start="183.43" dur="5.58">yama it can only be done by Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="186.64" dur="4.8">that it that is explored and emphasized</text>
  <text start="189.01" dur="4.559">on the day of Passover and Yahshua</text>
  <text start="191.44" dur="4.62">fulfilled that when he was nailed to the</text>
  <text start="193.569" dur="8.161">tree and shed his blood for us okay we</text>
  <text start="196.06" dur="6.75">can never do anything to cover our past</text>
  <text start="201.73" dur="2.22">transgressions</text>
  <text start="202.81" dur="3.39">once we&amp;#39;ve committed those</text>
  <text start="203.95" dur="5.46">transgressions we deserve eternal death</text>
  <text start="206.2" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s nothing we can do that can take</text>
  <text start="209.41" dur="4.53">those transgressions and the penalty for</text>
  <text start="211.69" dur="6.15">those transgressions away only he can</text>
  <text start="213.94" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s where yah comes in however what a</text>
  <text start="217.84" dur="3.899">lot of people don&amp;#39;t understand is that</text>
  <text start="219.1" dur="4.41">to enter into a covenant with God to</text>
  <text start="221.739" dur="4.441">enter into a loving relationship with</text>
  <text start="223.51" dur="5.07">him to be forgiven of your sins to have</text>
  <text start="226.18" dur="4.74">that blood lie be life is conditional</text>
  <text start="228.58" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s conditional it&amp;#39;s not unconditional</text>
  <text start="230.92" dur="3.83">it&amp;#39;s conditional and it&amp;#39;s conditional</text>
  <text start="233.11" dur="6.14">upon</text>
  <text start="234.75" dur="8.16">choice to agree to the terms of the</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="6.84">Covenant which is I&amp;#39;m gonna turn away</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="5.97">from sin we&amp;#39;re gonna ask you how to fill</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="5.13">us with the spirit members in his blood</text>
  <text start="248.88" dur="4.29">to purge our conscience so that we can</text>
  <text start="251.22" dur="4.02">go forth and never sin again so that we</text>
  <text start="253.17" dur="4.319">can live holy so that we can walk in his</text>
  <text start="255.24" dur="6.059">Commandments as David cries out over and</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="5.761">over again throughout psalm 119 his cut</text>
  <text start="261.299" dur="5.041">his covenant is conditional it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.25" dur="5.94">conditional upon the fact that we turned</text>
  <text start="266.34" dur="5.75">to him that we choose to submit our</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="6.39">lives to him not just as a one-time deal</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="6.21">but that we choose to turn our lives to</text>
  <text start="275.58" dur="5.19">him on an ongoing basis</text>
  <text start="278.3" dur="4">day after day month after month year</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="3.75">after year that we&amp;#39;re choosing to resist</text>
  <text start="282.3" dur="5.1">temptation that were choosing to place</text>
  <text start="284.52" dur="6.06">our love for him as the top road in our</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="5.519">lives every day of our life that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="290.58" dur="3.96">choosing to love our neighbors ourselves</text>
  <text start="292.919" dur="3.151">that we&amp;#39;re choosing to seek his</text>
  <text start="294.54" dur="6.42">Commandments and implement them in our</text>
  <text start="296.07" dur="7.77">lives this is all part of atonement we</text>
  <text start="300.96" dur="6.39">have to agree to walk in his covenant we</text>
  <text start="303.84" dur="5.79">have to agree to love him to enter into</text>
  <text start="307.35" dur="4.2">the terms of the Covenant so that he can</text>
  <text start="309.63" dur="3.77">then pour his blessing and his love upon</text>
  <text start="311.55" dur="5.79">us and so that he can draw close to us</text>
  <text start="313.4" dur="5.2">so Yom Kippur the Day of Atonement and</text>
  <text start="317.34" dur="3.6">that word atonement it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="318.6" dur="5.49">because it&amp;#39;s made up of the English</text>
  <text start="320.94" dur="5.039">words at one mint it&amp;#39;s like this is the</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="4.56">day to become at one with yah</text>

  <text start="364.24" dur="4.41">there are two sides to atonement there</text>
  <text start="366.67" dur="5.16">is Yahshua site yah side and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.65" dur="5.73">what&amp;#39;s very much remembered about and</text>

  <text start="376.09" dur="8.22">those spring feasts but Atonement Yom</text>
  <text start="380.95" dur="6.48">Kippur is about what man&amp;#39;s obligation is</text>
  <text start="384.31" dur="4.88">to repent this is why even to this day</text>
  <text start="387.43" dur="5">that you celebrating a purport by</text>
  <text start="389.19" dur="7.45">spending it as a day of repentance</text>
  <text start="392.43" dur="6.94">prayer this is why we don&amp;#39;t eat food or</text>
  <text start="396.64" dur="5.31">drink water all through this day because</text>
  <text start="399.37" dur="5.22">we realize our utter depravity and our</text>

  <text start="411.43" dur="7.26">he originally intended us to be before</text>
  <text start="413.53" dur="8.55">we got into sin so it&amp;#39;s very important</text>
  <text start="418.69" dur="6.98">to remember and to realize these two</text>
  <text start="422.08" dur="6.18">very important aspects to atonement</text>
