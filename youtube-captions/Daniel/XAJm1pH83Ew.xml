  <text start="104.679" dur="4.79">days ago she has a friend or had a</text>
  <text start="107.89" dur="5.189">friend that&amp;#39;s in this mental ward</text>
  <text start="109.469" dur="5.591">institution in the UK in England and she</text>
  <text start="113.079" dur="5.4">said today went well with a few hiccups</text>
  <text start="115.06" dur="5.19">at first my friend had recently moved a</text>
  <text start="118.479" dur="3.39">location to a maximum-security place</text>
  <text start="120.25" dur="4.02">hard to get into it seems like a mental</text>
  <text start="121.869" dur="4.771">ward not just brothel his alcoholism but</text>
  <text start="124.27" dur="4.379">that&amp;#39;s what she thinks when I arrived I</text>
  <text start="126.64" dur="3.69">phoned the reception to check which Ward</text>
  <text start="128.649" dur="4.17">I was supposed to go to and was told the</text>
  <text start="130.33" dur="4.409">dad part of the pedophile ring had just</text>
  <text start="132.819" dur="4.111">arrived so I waited in the car and</text>
  <text start="134.739" dur="4.231">prayed he would leave in the past he</text>
  <text start="136.93" dur="4.919">stayed for approximately two hours but</text>
  <text start="138.97" dur="4.56">after just a half hour he left then it</text>
  <text start="141.849" dur="3.181">took me approximately 15 minutes just to</text>
  <text start="143.53" dur="3.06">get through the doors and I was told I</text>
  <text start="145.03" dur="4.11">could only stay for approximately 10</text>
  <text start="146.59" dur="4.53">minutes because of lunch miraculously I</text>
  <text start="149.14" dur="4.17">was able to stay for two hours and 15</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="4.11">minutes and my friend was allowed and</text>
  <text start="153.31" dur="4.56">her request to skip lunch Pretty&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.23" dur="4.95">Yahshua I had my head covered thank you</text>
  <text start="157.87" dur="4.67">for the advice Daniel and I asked her a</text>
  <text start="160.18" dur="4.889">few times about accepting Messiah and</text>
  <text start="162.54" dur="4.83">which means not going out of her way but</text>
  <text start="165.069" dur="4.5">his way not going our way but his way I</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="4.48">asked her about five times and also</text>
  <text start="169.569" dur="4.621">warned her as you suggested Daniel about</text>
  <text start="171.85" dur="4.469">if she got delivered from these Devils</text>
  <text start="174.19" dur="3.96">and didn&amp;#39;t fully repent and get filled</text>
  <text start="176.319" dur="3.151">the spirit that seven worst devils would</text>
  <text start="178.15" dur="2.85">come upon her and that&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="179.47" dur="2.099">Yahshua would Jesus teaches in the</text>
  <text start="181" dur="3.15">Gospels</text>
  <text start="181.569" dur="4.771">she was cognizant and said yes each time</text>
  <text start="184.15" dur="3.869">I then laid hands upon her i anointed</text>
  <text start="186.34" dur="3.119">with oil and did a lot of praying and</text>
  <text start="188.019" dur="3.78">praying for the Holy Spirit to fill each</text>
  <text start="189.459" dur="3.631">part of my friend whilst I prayed I</text>
  <text start="191.799" dur="3.211">asked Wendy to look at me because</text>
  <text start="193.09" dur="3.57">especially during the deliverance as the</text>
  <text start="195.01" dur="3.99">windows the eyes of the windows of the</text>
  <text start="196.66" dur="4.079">soul and I wanted to see anything in her</text>
  <text start="199" dur="3.84">to pray against there was nothing</text>
  <text start="200.739" dur="4.08">overtly dramatic I&amp;#39;d asked John before</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="3.57">him that it would be so but surprisingly</text>
  <text start="204.819" dur="3.901">as I prayed she kept saying to me that I</text>
  <text start="206.41" dur="3.659">didn&amp;#39;t look like myself I didn&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="208.72" dur="3.54">this was the enemy distracting me from</text>
  <text start="210.069" dur="3.631">praying and as she repeated I then</text>
  <text start="212.26" dur="4.74">wondered if there could be evil in me</text>
  <text start="213.7" dur="5.31">finally I asked excuse me finally I</text>
  <text start="217" dur="3.569">asked what my friend meant and she said</text>
  <text start="219.01" dur="3.99">that my face had changed and that she</text>
  <text start="220.569" dur="4.861">saw God himself in my eyes and face I</text>
  <text start="223" dur="4.4">was understandably humbled and joyful</text>
  <text start="225.43" dur="5.13">because it&amp;#39;s all about Jesus&amp;#39;s power</text>
  <text start="227.4" dur="4.36">Yanis manifest this message is for all</text>
  <text start="230.56" dur="2.489">of us delivering and</text>
  <text start="231.76" dur="3">the front line you know it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="233.049" dur="4.14">wonderful being yoked and people seeing</text>
  <text start="234.76" dur="4.08">Jesus we all need reminding that God is</text>
  <text start="237.189" dur="3.031">in control that he uses us and is</text>
  <text start="238.84" dur="4.41">present with us making himself known</text>
  <text start="240.22" dur="4.739">what a relief it&amp;#39;s not about me we</text>
  <text start="243.25" dur="3.03">prayed for this the whole time</text>
  <text start="244.959" dur="3.211">I took her through the repentance in</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="4.23">Deuteronomy 18 10 through 12</text>
  <text start="248.17" dur="3.959">Wendy&amp;#39;s prayers were amazingly mature as</text>
  <text start="250.51" dur="3.78">we prayed I gave her a New Testament</text>
  <text start="252.129" dur="4.021">book with songs and she wanted the Old</text>
  <text start="254.29" dur="4.259">Testament to which was music to my ears</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="4.38">I later offered her another whole Bible</text>
  <text start="258.549" dur="4.111">but it was not a new one but she said</text>
  <text start="260.53" dur="3.63">she keeps the one I first offered as</text>
  <text start="262.66" dur="3.33">mentioned before I don&amp;#39;t want to give</text>
  <text start="264.16" dur="3.66">her everything again because that method</text>
  <text start="265.99" dur="3.239">hasn&amp;#39;t helped her in the past every time</text>
  <text start="267.82" dur="3.69">she would give her friend a Bible in the</text>
  <text start="269.229" dur="4.44">past she would always lose it because</text>
  <text start="271.51" dur="3.51">she hasn&amp;#39;t valued the word but I tell I</text>
  <text start="273.669" dur="2.761">told her to put her own money where her</text>
  <text start="275.02" dur="2.97">mouth is and invest in another Bible</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="3.78">because she&amp;#39;ll treasure it but in the</text>
  <text start="277.99" dur="4.38">meantime shall read it her eyes look</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="3.45">clearer and brighter I&amp;#39;m planning to go</text>
  <text start="282.37" dur="3.269">over more regularly to this new</text>
  <text start="283.66" dur="3.96">Detention Center there are big locked</text>
  <text start="285.639" dur="4.351">iron gates at the front but Yas with her</text>
  <text start="287.62" dur="4.519">I pray for a real sweet sleep tonight</text>
  <text start="289.99" dur="4.77">for her in Jesus&amp;#39;s name Amen</text>
  <text start="292.139" dur="4.21">peace is something that my friend hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="294.76" dur="3.87">enjoyed since she was two years old</text>
  <text start="296.349" dur="4.021">before this the time of her first evil</text>
  <text start="298.63" dur="3.78">incident my friend said Jesus was her</text>
  <text start="300.37" dur="3.15">best friend and I think I walked in and</text>

  <text start="305.47" dur="5.61">preparation for the evil he saw coming</text>
  <text start="307.75" dur="5.49">it breaks Christ&amp;#39;s heart so so evidently</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="3.66">much by the way I also got her to</text>
  <text start="313.24" dur="3.27">practice warfare as she discerned a</text>
  <text start="314.74" dur="3.84">troubling unclean spirit that had come</text>
  <text start="316.51" dur="3.629">back and told her disgusting things she</text>
  <text start="318.58" dur="3.42">usually sees and hears them screaming at</text>
  <text start="320.139" dur="4.741">her day and night in Christ she will</text>
