  <text start="7.319" dur="3.45">I have not been able to come out with a</text>
  <text start="8.519" dur="5.79">podcast in the last few weeks I was</text>
  <text start="10.769" dur="5.61">having difficulties with my pod cast</text>
  <text start="14.309" dur="3.991">program it just wasn&amp;#39;t working right so</text>
  <text start="16.379" dur="5.641">anyway I&amp;#39;ve decided to just use YouTube</text>
  <text start="18.3" dur="5.27">from now on to post my podcasts but this</text>
  <text start="22.02" dur="3.99">is going to be episode 2 i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="23.57" dur="5.049">specifically designing this podcast for</text>
  <text start="26.01" dur="6.54">yom kippur for those who are following</text>
  <text start="28.619" dur="6.991">the correct Hebrew scriptural calendar</text>
  <text start="32.55" dur="5.88">or not rabbinic tradition Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="35.61" dur="9.12">occurs this year 2010 from the evening</text>
  <text start="38.43" dur="8.129">of 1017 to the evening of 10 18 and so</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="4.5">basically the the second day of the week</text>
  <text start="46.559" dur="5.671">will be yom kippur so i&amp;#39;m making this</text>
  <text start="49.23" dur="5.34">podcast for yom kippur and what I want</text>
  <text start="52.23" dur="5.27">to do just kind of real briefly I only</text>
  <text start="54.57" dur="5.82">have a 10 minute time limit on youtube I</text>
  <text start="57.5" dur="6.039">want to explore the prophetic</text>
  <text start="60.39" dur="4.83">implications of the fall feast days so</text>
  <text start="63.539" dur="4.921">that would be yarm to rock the Feast of</text>
  <text start="65.22" dur="6.66">Trumpets which we celebrated about 89</text>
  <text start="68.46" dur="5.519">days ago and then Yom Kippur and then</text>
  <text start="71.88" dur="3.989">what happens five days after yom kippur</text>
  <text start="73.979" dur="5.521">which is the Feast of Tabernacles which</text>
  <text start="75.869" dur="5.011">is the eighth day wedding feast one</text>
  <text start="79.5" dur="3.619">thing that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really interesting</text>
  <text start="80.88" dur="4.59">that I want to sort of lay the</text>
  <text start="83.119" dur="5.651">foundation for this teaching is that if</text>
  <text start="85.47" dur="4.89">you look at the spring feasts and when</text>
  <text start="88.77" dur="5.07">we talk about for spring feasts we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="90.36" dur="5.91">talking about passover feast of</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="5.97">unleavened bread first fruits and then</text>
  <text start="96.27" dur="7.709">50 days later is the feast of pentecost</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="7.05">or chef load and when you look at these</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="5.881">spring feast days which are outlined in</text>
  <text start="106.86" dur="5.189">the Torah Leviticus 23 is one place that</text>
  <text start="109.86" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re outlined in the order</text>
  <text start="112.049" dur="4.53">that they&amp;#39;re given is the order that</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="7.559">they&amp;#39;re fulfilled prophetically so what</text>
  <text start="116.579" dur="6.091">I mean by that is first Yahweh presented</text>
  <text start="120.899" dur="5.22">to the children of Israel the feast of</text>
  <text start="122.67" dur="6.929">Passover and this is where the lamb is</text>
  <text start="126.119" dur="5.961">slaughtered and you eat a roasted lamb</text>
  <text start="129.599" dur="5.661">along with bitter herbs and</text>
  <text start="132.08" dur="6.03">oven bread and then and then that kicks</text>
  <text start="135.26" dur="4.14">off the feast of unleavened bread and it</text>
  <text start="138.11" dur="3.57">is in the midst of the feast of</text>
  <text start="139.4" dur="3.75">unleavened bread Passover week that the</text>
  <text start="141.68" dur="2.97">feast of firstfruits is celebrated and</text>
  <text start="143.15" dur="4.29">this is when the children of Israel</text>
  <text start="144.65" dur="4.59">would having come up to Jerusalem to</text>
  <text start="147.44" dur="3.63">celebrate Passover they had also brought</text>
  <text start="149.24" dur="4.26">up the first shocks of their barley</text>
  <text start="151.07" dur="4.32">harvest and to present this as a first</text>
  <text start="153.5" dur="3.21">fruits offering to the high priest who</text>
  <text start="155.39" dur="5.82">would then take it into the temple and</text>
  <text start="156.71" dur="6.78">wave it and then 50 days after this day</text>
  <text start="161.21" dur="4.74">of firstfruits you come to the feast of</text>
  <text start="163.49" dur="5.61">shavuot Pentecost which is when the</text>
  <text start="165.95" dur="5.55">wheat harvest was brought in and there</text>
  <text start="169.1" dur="4.68">would be two loaves of leavened bread</text>
  <text start="171.5" dur="5.4">not 11 but actually leavened bread that</text>
  <text start="173.78" dur="7.77">would be then made and presented unto</text>
  <text start="176.9" dur="8.19">yah so Yahshua presented in the tour in</text>
  <text start="181.55" dur="5.31">the sinach Passover then first fruits</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="4.56">which happens during Passover week and</text>
  <text start="186.86" dur="5.58">then shav loads in that order and if we</text>
  <text start="189.65" dur="5.21">look at history that&amp;#39;s the exact order</text>
  <text start="192.44" dur="5.16">that they&amp;#39;re fulfilled prophetically so</text>
  <text start="194.86" dur="5.77">first we have now we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="197.6" dur="6.78">2,000 years ago first we have Yahshua</text>
  <text start="200.63" dur="6.42">who was crucified to the tree and he was</text>
  <text start="204.38" dur="6.829">offered as a as a sacrifice for our sins</text>
  <text start="207.05" dur="6.719">and He fulfilled Passover ok and then</text>
  <text start="211.209" dur="4.211">that year firstfruits happened to fall</text>
  <text start="213.769" dur="4.44">three days and three nights after the</text>
  <text start="215.42" dur="4.65">day of Passover that was the year that</text>
  <text start="218.209" dur="3.871">he resurrected and that he presented</text>
  <text start="220.07" dur="4.77">himself as a first fruit offering to the</text>
  <text start="222.08" dur="6.15">father so he fulfills first fruits and</text>
  <text start="224.84" dur="5.25">then 50 days later on shab Pentecost is</text>
  <text start="228.23" dur="4.83">when the Ruach Hakodesh the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="230.09" dur="5.76">like fire fell upon the the Jewish</text>
  <text start="233.06" dur="4.95">apostles so just as they were presented</text>
  <text start="235.85" dur="4.02">in the tour you had Passover given first</text>
  <text start="238.01" dur="4.229">then you had the feast of firstfruits</text>
  <text start="239.87" dur="4.8">and then you had the feasts of Shavuot</text>
  <text start="242.239" dur="5.641">so too that&amp;#39;s how they fulfilled in</text>
  <text start="244.67" dur="5.4">history first Yahshua is sacrifice as</text>
  <text start="247.88" dur="3.54">the lamb on Passover he&amp;#39;s resurrected</text>
  <text start="250.07" dur="3.449">and present himself as a first fruit</text>
  <text start="251.42" dur="4.05">offering on first fruits and then the</text>
  <text start="253.519" dur="3.421">ruach ha kodesh Holy Spirit falls on</text>
  <text start="255.47" dur="4.65">Pentecost they&amp;#39;re fulfilled in the same</text>
  <text start="256.94" dur="4.56">order so just as it happened with the</text>
  <text start="260.12" dur="4.08">spring feasts it&amp;#39;s going to happen the</text>
  <text start="261.5" dur="4.32">same way with the fall feasts they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="264.2" dur="4.11">going to be happy they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="265.82" dur="6.45">II prophetically fulfilled in the same</text>
  <text start="268.31" dur="7.14">order okay so the first the fall feasts</text>
  <text start="272.27" dur="5.49">we have three fall feasts we have the</text>
  <text start="275.45" dur="5.25">Feast of Trumpets or young truck which</text>
  <text start="277.76" dur="5.88">the Jews wrongly call rosh hashanah then</text>
  <text start="280.7" dur="5.79">ten days later we have yom kippur excuse</text>
  <text start="283.64" dur="5.67">me Yom Kippur the feast of the day of</text>
  <text start="286.49" dur="5.22">atonement which is the day of afflicting</text>
  <text start="289.31" dur="3.78">your souls and fasting and then five</text>
  <text start="291.71" dur="4.59">days after that we have the Feast of</text>
  <text start="293.09" dur="6.05">Tabernacles which is an eight-day joyous</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="7.38">feast in which we reside in temporary</text>
  <text start="299.14" dur="7.12">dwelling places and we celebrate and we</text>
  <text start="303.68" dur="6.09">look forward to the time in which yah</text>
  <text start="306.26" dur="5.07">will one day dwell with us so in the</text>
  <text start="309.77" dur="3.6">same way that these feasts are given so</text>
  <text start="311.33" dur="4.86">will they be fulfilled so let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="313.37" dur="5.61">this prophetically we have the feasts of</text>
  <text start="316.19" dur="4.71">trumpets and this is where we were to</text>
  <text start="318.98" dur="4.2">have a Sabbath day it&amp;#39;s the first day of</text>
  <text start="320.9" dur="6.84">the seventh month this is where we blow</text>
  <text start="323.18" dur="6.3">our trumpet we blow trumpets we effect</text>
  <text start="327.74" dur="4.92">to this day the Jews will still go to</text>
  <text start="329.48" dur="4.83">the Wailing Wall and blow dozens and</text>
  <text start="332.66" dur="6.09">dozens and dozens and dozens of these</text>
  <text start="334.31" dur="6.62">silver trumpets and the reason why we do</text>
  <text start="338.75" dur="4.53">this every year is because one day as</text>
  <text start="340.93" dur="5.08">Apostle Paul talks about in 1st</text>
  <text start="343.28" dur="5.22">Corinthians 15 and also in 1st</text>
  <text start="346.01" dur="5.79">Thessalonians chapter 4 that one day the</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="4.74">last trumpet is going to blow if you</text>
  <text start="351.8" dur="3.15">look in Revelation there are seven</text>
  <text start="353.24" dur="4.86">trumpets and when that seventh trumpet</text>
  <text start="354.95" dur="4.77">blows the last trumpet this is the day</text>
  <text start="358.1" dur="4.17">of the resurrection of the righteous</text>
  <text start="359.72" dur="4.08">this is the first resurrection this is</text>
  <text start="362.27" dur="4.2">what all the saints from all the ages</text>
  <text start="363.8" dur="5.43">both dead and alive are resurrected in</text>
  <text start="366.47" dur="6.69">as in a single moment the the trumpet</text>
  <text start="369.23" dur="6.18">blasts and everyone who loves Yahshua at</text>
  <text start="373.16" dur="5.1">that point is transformed in a moment in</text>
  <text start="375.41" dur="5.49">a twinkling of an eye into a resurrected</text>
  <text start="378.26" dur="5.7">saint and they are brought up into the</text>
  <text start="380.9" dur="4.53">sky to meet Yahshua in the air and from</text>
  <text start="383.96" dur="3.78">that point on they will be with Yahshua</text>
  <text start="385.43" dur="4.23">ruling and reigning so that is the first</text>
  <text start="387.74" dur="4.41">feast that will be fulfilled with a fall</text>
  <text start="389.66" dur="4.8">feasts that&amp;#39;s basically the next piece</text>
  <text start="392.15" dur="4.95">that we have to look forward to that is</text>
  <text start="394.46" dur="4.02">what&amp;#39;s going to happen you&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="397.1" dur="1.8">to see I&amp;#39;m Kapoor and you&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="398.48" dur="2.76">to see</text>
  <text start="398.9" dur="5.21">nackles fulfilled until you see the</text>
  <text start="401.24" dur="5.25">resurrection which occurs on Yom to rock</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="4.57">now it&amp;#39;s very interesting is if you look</text>
  <text start="406.49" dur="6.69">at how yah presented the fall feasts in</text>
  <text start="408.68" dur="7.799">the Torah you have 10 days between yarm</text>
  <text start="413.18" dur="7.049">to rock and yom kippur 10 days and</text>
  <text start="416.479" dur="6.301">that&amp;#39;s very very significant because in</text>
  <text start="420.229" dur="5.401">the same way there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="422.78" dur="5.28">thousand years or 10 periods of a</text>
  <text start="425.63" dur="5.099">hundred years between the fulfillment of</text>
  <text start="428.06" dur="4.59">young to rock and yom kippur okay</text>
  <text start="430.729" dur="3.481">because what happens is you have the</text>
  <text start="432.65" dur="4.769">resurrection of the righteous on Yom to</text>
  <text start="434.21" dur="5.61">rock and that ushers in the Millennial</text>
  <text start="437.419" dur="4.021">Kingdom that ushers in that&amp;#39;s at that</text>
  <text start="439.82" dur="2.99">point in Revelation it talks about how</text>
  <text start="441.44" dur="3.599">the kingdoms of this world are</text>
  <text start="442.81" dur="5.919">transformed into the kingdoms of our yah</text>
  <text start="445.039" dur="5.461">and of his Messiah Messiah and then for</text>
  <text start="448.729" dur="3.631">a thousand years those who have been</text>
  <text start="450.5" dur="6.599">resurrected will rule and reign with the</text>
  <text start="452.36" dur="6.66">Messiah on planet earth and for the next</text>
  <text start="457.099" dur="3.54">thousand years Yahshua is ruling and</text>
  <text start="459.02" dur="4.56">reigning from Jerusalem over planet</text>
  <text start="460.639" dur="5.701">Earth but it says that after these</text>
  <text start="463.58" dur="6">thousand years are ended that Satan who</text>
  <text start="466.34" dur="4.94">has been locked up in a in a in a</text>
  <text start="469.58" dur="3.839">bottomless pit for these thousand years</text>
  <text start="471.28" dur="5.02">he has to be loose for a little season</text>
  <text start="473.419" dur="5.071">and during this period is when Satan</text>
  <text start="476.3" dur="4.2">sort of goes around and gathers all</text>
  <text start="478.49" dur="4.919">those who have not fully surrendered to</text>
  <text start="480.5" dur="5.4">Yahshua and he stages one last rebellion</text>
  <text start="483.409" dur="4.26">and just as he&amp;#39;s about to destroy</text>
  <text start="485.9" dur="3.93">Jerusalem he has the entire city</text>
  <text start="487.669" dur="5.581">surrounded with his armies fire from yah</text>
  <text start="489.83" dur="6.72">falls from the sky and incinerates Satan</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="4.919">and his armies and at that point the</text>
  <text start="496.55" dur="3.81">heavens in the earth pass away and you</text>
  <text start="498.169" dur="3.901">have the great white throne and at this</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="3.51">great white throne the books are opened</text>
  <text start="502.07" dur="4.409">including the Lamb&amp;#39;s Book of Life and</text>
  <text start="503.87" dur="4.89">everyone else is resurrected okay all</text>
  <text start="506.479" dur="3.301">the righteous who lived throughout who</text>
  <text start="508.76" dur="2.67">lived and died throughout the millennia</text>
  <text start="509.78" dur="3.929">more resurrected as well as all the</text>
  <text start="511.43" dur="4.2">wicked who have ever lived from that</text>
  <text start="513.709" dur="4.801">point till now are also resurrected and</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="4.95">it is at this point that there&amp;#39;s a final</text>
  <text start="518.51" dur="3.99">separation in which those who are found</text>
  <text start="520.58" dur="4.29">a Lamb&amp;#39;s Book of Life are joined the</text>
  <text start="522.5" dur="3.72">resurrected Saints who resurrected at</text>
  <text start="524.87" dur="4.23">yarm to rock a thousand years earlier</text>
  <text start="526.22" dur="4.59">and then the rest are thrown into the</text>
  <text start="529.1" dur="2.77">lake of fire along with Satan and his</text>
  <text start="530.81" dur="2.86">angels</text>
  <text start="531.87" dur="4.23">is the fulfillment of Yom Kippur the</text>
  <text start="533.67" dur="4.68">white throne judgment is the fulfillment</text>
  <text start="536.1" dur="4.95">of Yom Kippur the Day of Atonement it is</text>
  <text start="538.35" dur="7.25">when there is a final atonement done in</text>
  <text start="541.05" dur="6.69">which sin is completely removed and then</text>
  <text start="545.6" dur="3.58">after this you have the period of the</text>
  <text start="547.74" dur="3.18">new heavens and the new earth in which</text>
  <text start="549.18" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s a beautiful River gushing out</text>

  <text start="555.75" dur="5.43">long eight symbolizes the the number</text>
  <text start="558.93" dur="4.44">four new beginning and so for these</text>
  <text start="561.18" dur="4.349">eight days we&amp;#39;re dwelling in booze</text>
  <text start="563.37" dur="3.48">symbolizing when yah will tabernacle</text>
  <text start="565.529" dur="3">with men and if you read in Revelation</text>
  <text start="566.85" dur="2.94">when it starts to scribe in the new</text>
