  <text start="100.68" dur="4.29">when they took that golden calf and said</text>
  <text start="102.54" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;re dedicating it to Yahweh oh we know</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="3.84">the pagan golden calf is paying in it</text>

  <text start="111.09" dur="3.36">read Exodus to find out how I way</text>

  <text start="116.52" dur="3.629">what we&amp;#39;re doing it for Jesus no that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="118.29" dur="3.63">a pagan pagan day on the twenty-fifth of</text>
  <text start="120.149" dur="4.801">December that has its roots in the feast</text>
  <text start="121.92" dur="4.979">of Saturnalia so we need to be careful</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="4.47">and we need to know that truth always</text>
  <text start="126.899" dur="3.481">rejoices in love also if you read in</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="3.36">Matthew chapter</text>
  <text start="130.38" dur="4.05">15 just start in verse 1 the hypocrites</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="3.18">come up to Yahshua they try to accuse</text>
  <text start="134.43" dur="2.55">him and his disciples for not washing</text>
  <text start="135.96" dur="3.75">their hands and going through this</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="4.47">complex ritual of hand-washing and</text>
  <text start="139.71" dur="3.42">Yahshua shot right back at them and said</text>
  <text start="141.45" dur="3.33">you know you have this tradition where</text>
  <text start="143.13" dur="4.44">you can pay a certain amount of gold and</text>
  <text start="144.78" dur="4.32">then you can basically not treat your</text>
  <text start="147.57" dur="2.76">mother and father right you can not love</text>
  <text start="149.1" dur="3.33">them you can just treat them horribly</text>
  <text start="150.33" dur="4.92">but as long as you pay that gold you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="4.26">good and yah sure rebuked them because</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="3.39">that wicked tradition that actually</text>
  <text start="156.69" dur="4.08">violates Torah that says to honor your</text>
  <text start="158.64" dur="4.29">mother and father so that your days will</text>
  <text start="160.77" dur="3.84">be long on the earth they violated that</text>
  <text start="162.93" dur="3.33">with their own tradition and then a lot</text>
  <text start="164.61" dur="3.27">of people not everyone but a lot of</text>
  <text start="166.26" dur="3.36">people who celebrate Mother&amp;#39;s Day they</text>
  <text start="167.88" dur="2.61">get a nice card or bouquet of flowers or</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="2.58">whatever for the mom and then they</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="2.97">ignore her the rest of the year now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="172.2" dur="3.45">not saying everyone does that but what I</text>
  <text start="173.46" dur="4.23">am saying is it&amp;#39;s very similar the two</text>
  <text start="175.65" dur="3.45">traditions and it&amp;#39;s definitely against</text>
  <text start="177.69" dur="2.85">the Torah this is rooted in pagan</text>
  <text start="179.1" dur="3.33">goddess worship and you can look at the</text>
  <text start="180.54" dur="4.44">text I&amp;#39;m not being extremely radical</text>
  <text start="182.43" dur="4.62">about this well I take that back you</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="3.78">know Yahshua&amp;#39;s radical about loving and</text>
  <text start="187.05" dur="4.14">keeping the Torah he was radical about</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="4.98">loving yah out of a heart for love in</text>
  <text start="191.19" dur="4.47">keeping the commandments Yahshua Jesus</text>
  <text start="193.74" dur="3.3">of Nazareth was radical about that so</text>
  <text start="195.66" dur="3.12">I&amp;#39;m going to be radical about that too</text>
