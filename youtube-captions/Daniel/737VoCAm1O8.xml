  <text start="5.7" dur="3.75">hello to the youtube community I</text>
  <text start="7.17" dur="6.45">apologize that there is no image here</text>
  <text start="9.45" dur="5.91">that our our I camera is broken um some</text>
  <text start="13.62" dur="3.989">of you may know if you click on my name</text>
  <text start="15.36" dur="4.499">on YouTube that I&amp;#39;ve made several videos</text>
  <text start="17.609" dur="5.641">for Ron Paul over the last couple months</text>
  <text start="19.859" dur="5.281">and generally my videos have been</text>
  <text start="23.25" dur="3.39">received well I have gotten negative</text>
  <text start="25.14" dur="3.45">comments on some of them but generally</text>
  <text start="26.64" dur="3.93">and overall I&amp;#39;ve gotten positive</text>
  <text start="28.59" dur="5.79">reactions I my videos tend to be very</text>
  <text start="30.57" dur="7.44">optimistic and hopeful and the reason</text>
  <text start="34.38" dur="6.089">that is is I am NOT one given to you</text>
  <text start="38.01" dur="4.5">know conspiracy theories or negativity I</text>
  <text start="40.469" dur="5.43">generally have a very positive and</text>
  <text start="42.51" dur="5.04">optimistic look at life and and in</text>
  <text start="45.899" dur="4.32">particular with ron paul and his</text>
  <text start="47.55" dur="6.48">campaign i adopt his kind of optimistic</text>
  <text start="50.219" dur="5.881">outlook on on events and of course even</text>
  <text start="54.03" dur="3.959">with that optimistic outlook you know of</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="4.5">course I got a little discouraged</text>
  <text start="57.989" dur="4.05">obviously by the New Hampshire primary</text>
  <text start="60.6" dur="3.809">results because I was expecting a</text>
  <text start="62.039" dur="3.721">stronger finish than than the finish</text>
  <text start="64.409" dur="4.5">that he&amp;#39;s currently at which is fifth</text>
  <text start="65.76" dur="8.16">place but I wanted to very quickly just</text>
  <text start="68.909" dur="8.011">get to the point i have now seen on on</text>
  <text start="73.92" dur="6.089">several forums of ron paul including</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="6.51">daily paul com I&amp;#39;ve seen a YouTube as</text>
  <text start="80.009" dur="6.451">well we&amp;#39;re basically there are reports</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="5.91">coming in that although Ron Paul has</text>
  <text start="86.46" dur="4.65">received zero votes in Sutton County New</text>
  <text start="89.34" dur="3.66">Hampshire there are at least three</text>
  <text start="91.11" dur="4.2">people that are saying wait a minute I</text>
  <text start="93" dur="6.38">went to the polls tonight and I voted</text>
  <text start="95.31" dur="7.199">for Ron Paul in Sutton county also I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="99.38" dur="6.51">seen a mathematician Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="102.509" dur="7.32">excuse me Wall Street analyst</text>
  <text start="105.89" dur="6.88">statistically proves very mathematically</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="4.591">and logically that voter fraud is going</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="4.98">on that according to the statistics</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="4.71">rampal should actually have more votes</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="4.259">than what is currently being tabulated</text>
  <text start="119.13" dur="5.37">that when you compare the hand</text>
  <text start="122.009" dur="5.341">counterbalance to the digital counted</text>
  <text start="124.5" dur="4.89">ballots that there is a huge discrepancy</text>
  <text start="127.35" dur="6.21">and this is not only for Ron Paul but</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="5.849">this is also for Obama evidently Obama</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="3.899">received quite a bit more</text>
  <text start="135.239" dur="5.761">percentage-wise the hand counted votes</text>
  <text start="137.459" dur="4.981">than Hillary Clinton overall but when</text>
  <text start="141" dur="4.89">you go to the digitally counted votes</text>
  <text start="142.44" dur="5.129">Hilary takes a lead there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="145.89" dur="4.16">discrepancy with mitt romney mit romney</text>
  <text start="147.569" dur="5.101">is shown to get a many more votes</text>
  <text start="150.05" dur="4.11">statewide when you look at the digitally</text>
  <text start="152.67" dur="3.599">counted votes but when you go to state</text>
  <text start="154.16" dur="5.32">excuse me when you go to hand counted</text>
  <text start="156.269" dur="5.94">votes romney does not get nearly as much</text>
  <text start="159.48" dur="5.43">as he is supposedly to have gotten so</text>
  <text start="162.209" dur="4.051">clearly with these facts i mean and you</text>
  <text start="164.91" dur="3.81">know again these are being presented by</text>
  <text start="166.26" dur="4.53">not conspiracy theorists or people who</text>
  <text start="168.72" dur="4.71">are just you know have a chip on their</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="6">shoulder they&amp;#39;re being presented by</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="5.16">mathematicians by statistician &amp;#39;he&amp;#39;s by</text>
  <text start="176.79" dur="5.82">people who are just you know saying look</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="6.6">this doesn&amp;#39;t look quite right and you</text>
  <text start="182.61" dur="5.61">know again i&amp;#39;m personally not one to be</text>
  <text start="185.19" dur="5.579">given to any type of voter fraud or</text>
  <text start="188.22" dur="5.22">conspiracy type theories i I just I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="190.769" dur="6.091">not like that um but clearly this is not</text>
  <text start="193.44" dur="6.81">just about Ron Paul it looks like that</text>
  <text start="196.86" dur="5.79">if this is correct Obama should have</text>
  <text start="200.25" dur="4.56">actually won New Hampshire on the</text>
  <text start="202.65" dur="5.899">Democratic side and lost Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="7.11">by it by a margin that looks pretty</text>
  <text start="208.549" dur="5.051">pretty suspicious so the reason I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="211.92" dur="3.48">putting this YouTube out is I&amp;#39;m hoping</text>
  <text start="213.6" dur="4.169">that I can raise awareness about this</text>
  <text start="215.4" dur="4.38">issue I&amp;#39;m certainly planning to take</text>
  <text start="217.769" dur="4.47">some action by making some phone calls</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="4.289">tomorrow morning and figuring out what i</text>
  <text start="222.239" dur="2.731">can do I live in Portland Oregon so</text>
  <text start="224.069" dur="2.67">obviously i&amp;#39;m not a New Hampshire</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="3.66">resident but I&amp;#39;m going to try to find</text>
  <text start="226.739" dur="4.771">out what I can do I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="228.63" dur="4.859">definitely make this very very clear</text>
  <text start="231.51" dur="3.569">with the local portland oregon meetup</text>
  <text start="233.489" dur="3.78">group which is one of the largest meetup</text>
  <text start="235.079" dur="3.841">groups in the nation and I would just</text>
  <text start="237.269" dur="5.271">encourage everyone who listens to this</text>
  <text start="238.92" dur="6.899">YouTube to please spread this message</text>
  <text start="242.54" dur="5.529">let it go viral you know document this</text>
  <text start="245.819" dur="4.2">evidence you can find websites you can</text>
  <text start="248.069" dur="3.841">go to daily Paul calm you can go to ron</text>
  <text start="250.019" dur="3.75">paul forums com and you can find the</text>
  <text start="251.91" dur="4.47">evidence that i have uncovered that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.769" dur="3.601">that many people are shown now I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="256.38" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of YouTube&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="4.649">about this as well we need to do</text>
  <text start="260.1" dur="5.82">something about this okay we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="262.019" dur="6.841">going we cannot just sit sit by</text>
  <text start="265.92" dur="4.71">and just say well okay you know we got</text>
  <text start="268.86" dur="4.62">cheated or there&amp;#39;s vote fraud but you</text>
  <text start="270.63" dur="6.45">know we&amp;#39;ll just perk up and and and</text>
  <text start="273.48" dur="6.39">continue the fighting and go on we owe</text>
  <text start="277.08" dur="5.46">this not just to ron paul not just to</text>
  <text start="279.87" dur="5.97">obama but we owe this to the American</text>
  <text start="282.54" dur="6.87">people into our nation either we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="285.84" dur="5.28">serious about you know really sparking</text>
  <text start="289.41" dur="3.63">revolution and taking this nation back</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="3.45">over or not and and this this is</text>
  <text start="293.04" dur="4.53">something that we need to really</text>
  <text start="294.57" dur="5.85">seriously do and obviously you know</text>
  <text start="297.57" dur="5.49">there are many routes that we can take</text>
  <text start="300.42" dur="5.43">peaceful routes that we can take Ron</text>
  <text start="303.06" dur="6.12">Paul&amp;#39;s always advocating peace in how we</text>
  <text start="305.85" dur="4.65">are in our approach to things so there</text>
  <text start="309.18" dur="4.2">are many routes that we can take in this</text>
  <text start="310.5" dur="4.62">information age as to how to proceed but</text>
  <text start="313.38" dur="3.36">we need to really make a stink about</text>
  <text start="315.12" dur="4.88">this we need to present our evidence we</text>
  <text start="316.74" dur="7.38">need to be logical and cool-headed and</text>
  <text start="320" dur="7.45">you know see how things go if and this</text>
  <text start="324.12" dur="5.4">is a big if but if we present this</text>
  <text start="327.45" dur="3.57">evidence and it&amp;#39;s substantiated and we</text>
  <text start="329.52" dur="3.93">make a stink about it and we you know</text>
  <text start="331.02" dur="4.23">and we present this to the powers that</text>
  <text start="333.45" dur="4.59">be to the government authorities to the</text>
  <text start="335.25" dur="6.87">media outlets to the decision makers and</text>
  <text start="338.04" dur="7.17">if they having been presented this very</text>
  <text start="342.12" dur="6.35">logical evidence decide to ignore us or</text>
  <text start="345.21" dur="5.79">decide to basically say well you know</text>
  <text start="348.47" dur="4.09">we&amp;#39;re just going to ignore this or you</text>
  <text start="351" dur="8.22">know yeah you may have a case but if</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="9.42">that&amp;#39;s the case then what what other</text>
  <text start="359.22" dur="4.41">course do we have whatever course do we</text>
  <text start="361.98" dur="3.78">have then to take up armed resistance</text>
  <text start="363.63" dur="4.2">against the government now obviously I</text>
  <text start="365.76" dur="4.26">mean how do you how does an American</text>
  <text start="367.83" dur="4.95">people citizen jury with you know armed</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="5.58">with shotguns and just the weapons you</text>
  <text start="372.78" dur="4.53">can buy it at a local target or not</text>
  <text start="375.6" dur="3.24">target whoever you buy weapons you look</text>
  <text start="377.31" dur="2.82">local gun shop how does American</text>
  <text start="378.84" dur="2.88">citizens take up arms against the US</text>
  <text start="380.13" dur="4.44">military I mean the US military is the</text>
  <text start="381.72" dur="6.03">most armed military in the world so how</text>
  <text start="384.57" dur="6.54">would you do that um i have no idea i</text>
  <text start="387.75" dur="5.19">would have never advocated taking up</text>
  <text start="391.11" dur="3.99">arms against the government but what</text>
  <text start="392.94" dur="4.89">would it take what would it take for us</text>
  <text start="395.1" dur="5.05">to pledge our life our honor our Liberty</text>
  <text start="397.83" dur="6.34">our family&amp;#39;s lives</text>
  <text start="400.15" dur="7.68">to fight and to me in my mind if and</text>
  <text start="404.17" dur="5.48">this is again a big if if you know this</text>
  <text start="407.83" dur="4.14">is presented in a logical cool-headed</text>
  <text start="409.65" dur="4.66">manner this evidence is substantiated</text>
  <text start="411.97" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s presented and then we are given the</text>
  <text start="414.31" dur="3.96">big you know the media and the</text>
  <text start="417.28" dur="3.12">government and the authorities just</text>
  <text start="418.27" dur="3.39">ignore us I think at that point we need</text>
  <text start="420.4" dur="3.62">to have some serious discussions about</text>
  <text start="421.66" dur="4.92">taking up arms against the government</text>
  <text start="424.02" dur="4.21">and you know I realize the FBI and</text>
  <text start="426.58" dur="3.63">others might look at these YouTube&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="428.23" dur="5.04">mine in particular and say oh we need to</text>
  <text start="430.21" dur="5.99">keep a watch on this guy but folks you</text>
  <text start="433.27" dur="4.98">know I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t see an alternative</text>
  <text start="436.2" dur="4.93">my wife thinks I&amp;#39;m jumping to</text>
  <text start="438.25" dur="4.83">conclusions and obviously I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="441.13" dur="4.02">look we need to proceed with caution</text>
  <text start="443.08" dur="4.64">when you do all we can peacefully like</text>
  <text start="445.15" dur="6.03">Ron Paul recommends to peacefully</text>
  <text start="447.72" dur="5.89">present our case and logically with cool</text>
  <text start="451.18" dur="4.02">headedness to present our case but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="453.61" dur="4.38">just it just caused me to think and</text>
  <text start="455.2" dur="4.29">wonder tonight what would it take what</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="3.57">would it take I mean I have a wife I</text>
  <text start="459.49" dur="5.07">have five children all under the age of</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="5.04">seven so I would have a lot to lose if I</text>
  <text start="464.56" dur="3.18">were to you know take up arms against</text>
  <text start="466.6" dur="3.75">the government i would have a whole lot</text>
  <text start="467.74" dur="4.14">to lose so you know it&amp;#39;s not something</text>
  <text start="470.35" dur="2.46">we should just jump into but but what</text>
  <text start="471.88" dur="4.83">would it take it something to think</text>
