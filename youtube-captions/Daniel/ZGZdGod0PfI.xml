  <text start="0.35" dur="5.409">good afternoon and happy preparation day</text>
  <text start="3.51" dur="4.62">everyone this is daniel lee with tour</text>
  <text start="5.759" dur="7.071">restoration ministries and this is my</text>
  <text start="8.13" dur="7.11">weekly pre shabbat podcast or maybe even</text>
  <text start="12.83" dur="4.119">the shabbat podcast depending on when</text>
  <text start="15.24" dur="4.16">you finally get to listen to this but i</text>
  <text start="16.949" dur="5.971">wanted to deal with the subject today</text>
  <text start="19.4" dur="5.59">because it&amp;#39;s something that has been</text>
  <text start="22.92" dur="4.17">going around the messianic movement for</text>
  <text start="24.99" dur="5.64">I don&amp;#39;t know how long last couple of</text>
  <text start="27.09" dur="5.879">years and I wanted to just quickly deal</text>
  <text start="30.63" dur="5.429">with it and that is the lunar or as I</text>
  <text start="32.969" dur="4.701">like to refer to it the loonie Sabbath</text>
  <text start="36.059" dur="4.351">and in case you don&amp;#39;t know what this is</text>
  <text start="37.67" dur="5.709">this basically is a belief that states</text>
  <text start="40.41" dur="6.66">that rather than the Sabbath day being</text>
  <text start="43.379" dur="5.221">on the seventh day of the week which on</text>
  <text start="47.07" dur="4.759">a gregorian calendar that would be from</text>
  <text start="48.6" dur="6.75">friday at sunset to Saturday at sunset</text>
  <text start="51.829" dur="6.611">the lunar Sabbath people basically say</text>
  <text start="55.35" dur="6">that the the Shabbat actually occurs on</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="5.189">the new moon and then every seven days</text>
  <text start="61.35" dur="5.67">in account every seven days from that</text>
  <text start="63.629" dur="6.181">new moon so let&amp;#39;s say you come to a</text>
  <text start="67.02" dur="4.86">month and the new moon occurs on a on a</text>
  <text start="69.81" dur="3.93">Wednesday well then you would have the</text>
  <text start="71.88" dur="3.21">Sabbath on the Wednesday and then you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="73.74" dur="3.86">count seven more days from there and</text>
  <text start="75.09" dur="5.13">you&amp;#39;d have the Sabbath on that day so</text>
  <text start="77.6" dur="5.559">try to ask your employer off for those</text>
  <text start="80.22" dur="5.1">days Yeah right it really is a</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="3.541">completely Looney idea and there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="85.32" dur="3.689">of different ways that that you can</text>
  <text start="86.7" dur="3.48">actually go with with the scripture to</text>
  <text start="89.009" dur="4.101">show that this is a completely</text>
  <text start="90.18" dur="5.939">unscriptural doctrine but what my</text>
  <text start="93.11" dur="6.219">tendency to do is to always get the most</text>
  <text start="96.119" dur="6.93">simplest argument the simplest biblical</text>
  <text start="99.329" dur="6.511">proof to show that something is not true</text>
  <text start="103.049" dur="4.651">so that&amp;#39;s very very easy understand so</text>
  <text start="105.84" dur="4.86">what I want to do is I just want to read</text>
  <text start="107.7" dur="8.15">really quickly here from Genesis chapter</text>
  <text start="110.7" dur="9.32">1 starting in verse 14 and it says this</text>
  <text start="115.85" dur="4.17">excuse me starting actually in verse</text>
  <text start="120.439" dur="4.331">yeah starting in verse 14 and he always</text>
  <text start="123.36" dur="3.149">said let there be lights in the</text>
  <text start="124.77" dur="4.349">firmament of the heaven to divide the</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="4.921">day from the night and let them be for</text>
  <text start="129.119" dur="4.651">signs and for seasons and four days and</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="3.6">years and let them be for lights</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="3.26">the firmament of the heaven to give</text>
  <text start="135.03" dur="4.62">light upon the earth and it was so and</text>
  <text start="137.03" dur="4.93">Yahweh made two great lights the greater</text>
  <text start="139.65" dur="4.2">light to rule the day and their lesser</text>
  <text start="141.96" dur="4.74">light to rule the night he made the</text>
  <text start="143.85" dur="4.08">stars also and Yahweh set them in the</text>
  <text start="146.7" dur="3.57">firmament of the heaven to give light</text>
  <text start="147.93" dur="4.26">upon the earth and to rule over the day</text>
  <text start="150.27" dur="3.9">and over the night and two divided the</text>
  <text start="152.19" dur="4.32">light from the darkness and you always</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="5.55">saw that it was good and the evening and</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="4.74">the morning were the fourth day now with</text>
  <text start="159.72" dur="3.42">the with the lunar Sabbath people will</text>
  <text start="161.25" dur="4.11">point out as they&amp;#39;ll say look if you</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="4.89">look at verse 14 it says right here that</text>
  <text start="165.36" dur="5.88">these lights the Sun the Moon the Stars</text>
  <text start="168.03" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re put in the sky for signs and</text>
  <text start="171.24" dur="5.52">seasons for days and years so just like</text>
  <text start="173.76" dur="5.82">we use the Sun the Moon the stars to</text>
  <text start="176.76" dur="4.65">determine the feast days and the</text>
  <text start="179.58" dur="4.73">beginning of the year so too we should</text>
  <text start="181.41" dur="5.46">use it to determine the weekly Sabbath</text>
  <text start="184.31" dur="8.05">however here is the error in that</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="7.2">thinking it is true that we use the moon</text>
  <text start="192.36" dur="5.4">the Sun of the stars to determine the</text>
  <text start="194.07" dur="6.6">new year to determine when a month</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="5.22">begins the new moon determine when the</text>
  <text start="200.67" dur="5.1">the annual feast days are like Passover</text>
  <text start="202.98" dur="5.91">and Tabernacles however the Shabbat is a</text>
  <text start="205.77" dur="6.81">completely different animal and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="208.89" dur="7.74">why the key verse and what I just read</text>
  <text start="212.58" dur="8.07">is verse 19 it says in the evening and</text>
  <text start="216.63" dur="6.87">the morning were the fourth day now</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="5.37">there is absolutely no way that you can</text>
  <text start="223.5" dur="5.9">determine the weekly Sabbath the seventh</text>
  <text start="226.02" dur="7.05">day Shabbat using the new moon because</text>
  <text start="229.4" dur="6.91">according to Genesis the moon was not</text>
  <text start="233.07" dur="6.69">even created until the fourth day of the</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="6.03">original seven day cycle in other words</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="4.98">in Genesis you had the seven day cycle</text>
  <text start="242.34" dur="3.72">begin on day one and it was that seventh</text>
  <text start="244.74" dur="3.99">day that Yahweh arrested that</text>
  <text start="246.06" dur="5.82">established the weekly Shabbat well that</text>
  <text start="248.73" dur="6.12">seven-day cycle began three days before</text>
  <text start="251.88" dur="6.03">the moon even existed so the Shabbat</text>
  <text start="254.85" dur="5.43">unlike all the other feast days and</text>
  <text start="257.91" dur="5.55">determining the hebrew new year and the</text>
  <text start="260.28" dur="7.23">new moon the shabbat is determined by</text>
  <text start="263.46" dur="6.45">that original seven day cycle completely</text>
  <text start="267.51" dur="3.9">dependent of the moon for that matter</text>
  <text start="269.91" dur="3.21">completely independent from the Sun and</text>
  <text start="271.41" dur="4.14">the stars and all that that that jazz</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="5.46">because Yahweh establishes himself in</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="5.43">that original seven day cycle now the</text>
  <text start="278.58" dur="4.92">question that comes up is well how do we</text>
  <text start="280.98" dur="4.88">know that we are keeping the original</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="4.8">seven day cycle how do we know that</text>
  <text start="285.86" dur="4.42">looking at our door Gorean calendar that</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="3.81">friday evening to saturday evening</text>
  <text start="290.28" dur="3.48">corresponds to that original seventh day</text>
  <text start="292.11" dur="4.23">well that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s a good question</text>
  <text start="293.76" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s a legitimate question and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="5.7">here&amp;#39;s the answer that if we look at all</text>
  <text start="299.31" dur="4.77">the other different cultures for example</text>
  <text start="302.04" dur="5.55">i&amp;#39;m going to point to the spanish</text>
  <text start="304.08" dur="7.26">culture we can see that the day that we</text>
  <text start="307.59" dur="6">call saturday is called seven sabido</text>
  <text start="311.34" dur="4.53">seeeeee in in Spanish and sabados</text>
  <text start="313.59" dur="3.78">literally means Sabbath so right there</text>
  <text start="315.87" dur="4.05">we have kind of another culture that</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="5.7">points to that same time period as being</text>
  <text start="319.92" dur="6">the Shabbat if we look at the Jewish</text>
  <text start="323.07" dur="5.13">culture who remember the Jews are very</text>
  <text start="325.92" dur="5.61">very meticulous when it comes to keeping</text>
  <text start="328.2" dur="5.07">time and records and if we look at the</text>
  <text start="331.53" dur="4.77">Jewish culture they have been keeping</text>
  <text start="333.27" dur="6.65">the seventh day shabbat from Friday to</text>
  <text start="336.3" dur="6.66">Saturday evening for thousands of years</text>
  <text start="339.92" dur="7.24">going back as far as the time as Yahshua</text>
  <text start="342.96" dur="5.7">the Messiah and also let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s take a</text>
  <text start="347.16" dur="4.26">completely different culture if you look</text>
  <text start="348.66" dur="4.44">at the the Chinese culture okay you pull</text>
  <text start="351.42" dur="3.3">up a Chinese calendar in fact if you go</text>
  <text start="353.1" dur="3.81">to Google you type in chinese calendar</text>
  <text start="354.72" dur="5.25">you bring up a chinese calendar remember</text>
  <text start="356.91" dur="5.79">the Chinese has nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="359.97" dur="6.87">Western Gregorian pagan calendar and yet</text>
  <text start="362.7" dur="7.83">the seventh day is still on what would</text>
  <text start="366.84" dur="7.41">coincide with Saturday on our calendar</text>
  <text start="370.53" dur="5.64">so even in a counter that has absolutely</text>
  <text start="374.25" dur="3.3">nothing to do with the pagan roots of</text>
  <text start="376.17" dur="3.69">the Western Gregorian calendar that we</text>
  <text start="377.55" dur="4.32">fall today it still points toward</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="4.89">Saturday&amp;#39;s being the seventh day the</text>
  <text start="381.87" dur="4.83">Shabbat and and this makes sense that</text>
  <text start="384.75" dur="3.66">Yahweh would preserve the seventh day</text>
  <text start="386.7" dur="3.69">cycle for all the cultures across the</text>
  <text start="388.41" dur="4.92">world so that we could keep this</text>
  <text start="390.39" dur="6.78">commandment so it&amp;#39;s a very simple simple</text>
  <text start="393.33" dur="6.9">answer to to that to that question so</text>
  <text start="397.17" dur="3.7">whatever you do save yourself a lot of</text>
  <text start="400.23" dur="3.69">stress</text>
  <text start="400.87" dur="5.04">you know don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t get yourself</text>
  <text start="403.92" dur="3.61">stressed out about trying to ask your</text>
  <text start="405.91" dur="4.2">employer for who knows how many days</text>
  <text start="407.53" dur="5.64">different days you need every week and</text>
  <text start="410.11" dur="4.62">every month trying to follow this loony</text>
  <text start="413.17" dur="4.47">Sabbath because it is completely Looney</text>
  <text start="414.73" dur="4.89">it has no basis in Scripture and the</text>
  <text start="417.64" dur="3.78">seventh day shabbat from friday evening</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="7.23">at sunset to Saturday evening at sunset</text>
  <text start="421.42" dur="8.04">is has been and always will be Lee</text>
