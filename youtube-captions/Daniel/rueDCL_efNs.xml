  <text start="6.299" dur="5.46">Sabbath and suka that&amp;#39;s about to begin I</text>
  <text start="8.91" dur="3.95">had mentioned a few days ago that I was</text>
  <text start="11.759" dur="3.901">going to start making podcasts</text>
  <text start="12.86" dur="4.69">explaining every single commandment in</text>
  <text start="15.66" dur="3.959">Torah and then also the spiritual</text>
  <text start="17.55" dur="3.54">application minded and I wanted to start</text>
  <text start="19.619" dur="2.511">off with the Commandant of the ZZ</text>
  <text start="21.09" dur="4.679">because I&amp;#39;ve been getting a lot of</text>
  <text start="22.13" dur="5.29">questions about that trying to put my</text>
  <text start="25.769" dur="3.781">camera in a place where it will just</text>
  <text start="27.42" dur="5.37">stay so that I can show how to make them</text>
  <text start="29.55" dur="4.74">really well the Commandant for wearing</text>
  <text start="32.79" dur="4.35">the blue fringe on the four corners of</text>
  <text start="34.29" dur="5.63">the garment it&amp;#39;s in numbers 15 starting</text>
  <text start="37.14" dur="5.489">in verse 37 you all would be n and</text>
  <text start="39.92" dur="5.619">Yahweh commanded Mosher and all the</text>
  <text start="42.629" dur="5.16">children of Israel both men and women to</text>
  <text start="45.539" dur="3.781">wear a fringe of blue in the four</text>
  <text start="47.789" dur="3.171">corners of their garments to remind</text>
  <text start="49.32" dur="5.19">themselves to keep the commandments</text>
  <text start="50.96" dur="6.22">because we&amp;#39;re very forgetful now Yahshua</text>
  <text start="54.51" dur="5.369">the Messiah also wore these blue fringes</text>
  <text start="57.18" dur="4.859">if you remember in the Gospels the woman</text>
  <text start="59.879" dur="4.71">who had that issue of blood for 10 years</text>
  <text start="62.039" dur="4.201">she caught a hold of yahshua&amp;#39;s garments</text>
  <text start="64.589" dur="3.061">the skirt of his garment the hem of His</text>
  <text start="66.24" dur="3.51">garment you look at the greek words it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="67.65" dur="3.93">actually his blue fringe and when she</text>
  <text start="69.75" dur="4.049">grabbed a hold of his blueprint she was</text>
  <text start="71.58" dur="6.719">healed and this is why there&amp;#39;s healing</text>
  <text start="73.799" dur="6.541">in his wings now the fringes I wear have</text>
  <text start="78.299" dur="3.901">been like this and and you know I&amp;#39;m sort</text>
  <text start="80.34" dur="3.24">of creative I got the red in here to the</text>
  <text start="82.2" dur="2.94">only commandment that it has to be blue</text>
  <text start="83.58" dur="2.67">that&amp;#39;s the only thing that has to be it</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="4.26">has to be on the four corners of your</text>
  <text start="86.25" dur="4.799">garment um I like to put the right into</text>
  <text start="89.4" dur="2.67">the blood of Yahshua the problem with</text>
  <text start="91.049" dur="2.651">these though is that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="92.07" dur="4.03">getting caught between my shirt</text>
  <text start="93.7" dur="4.32">and my and my cancer stuff because</text>
  <text start="96.1" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re so light weight so I decided to</text>
  <text start="98.02" dur="5.93">make some different ZZ that still fought</text>
  <text start="100.81" dur="5.25">the cameras they just look different and</text>
  <text start="103.95" dur="5.169">it look like this now I know they look</text>
  <text start="106.06" dur="5.519">like ropes but they&amp;#39;re much they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="109.119" dur="3.721">get caught because what the problem is</text>
  <text start="111.579" dur="6.061">they were getting caught between my</text>
  <text start="112.84" dur="8.91">shirt and in my time so I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="117.64" dur="5.909">show how to make these just basically</text>
  <text start="121.75" dur="5.159">again you buy a hundred percent cotton</text>
  <text start="123.549" dur="5.341">shirt easily by</text>
  <text start="126.909" dur="3.24">and this is mainly going to be for men</text>
  <text start="128.89" dur="3.599">because women you got it pretty much</text>
  <text start="130.149" dur="4.681">just pin it on your dress or I guess if</text>
  <text start="132.489" dur="4.47">you&amp;#39;re wearing a blouse you can wear it</text>
  <text start="134.83" dur="4.62">under the blouse but anyway so you got a</text>
  <text start="136.959" dur="7.261">plain white hundred percent shirt and</text>
  <text start="139.45" dur="6.599">then just get your scissors and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="144.22" dur="4.62">very easy to transform this one hundred</text>
  <text start="146.049" dur="4.951">percent cotton white t shirt into a</text>
  <text start="148.84" dur="5.91">four-corner garment you just you know</text>
  <text start="151" dur="6.41">get the scene on either side and you</text>
  <text start="154.75" dur="2.66">just cut up it</text>
  <text start="157.45" dur="8.48">now we have two corners on one side and</text>
  <text start="161.519" dur="4.411">then here&amp;#39;s the other scene</text>
  <text start="168.68" dur="2.85">now we have two corners on the other</text>
  <text start="170.18" dur="3.21">sides and now we have a four-corner</text>
  <text start="171.53" dur="4.01">garment and then you just you just make</text>
  <text start="173.39" dur="4.5">holes in the four corners I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="175.54" dur="5.08">use your scissors if you have a hole</text>
  <text start="177.89" dur="5.25">punch that will work to probably be</text>
  <text start="180.62" dur="5.459">better but I don&amp;#39;t have one so i&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="183.14" dur="8.01">using my stickers so you just make four</text>
  <text start="186.079" dur="7.28">holes in the four corners what i&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="191.15" dur="2.209">here</text>
  <text start="196.9" dur="5.85">and now now you have a catan basically</text>
  <text start="200.739" dur="4.681">now you have a four-corner garment for</text>
  <text start="202.75" dur="6.48">holes in each side on that you can just</text>
  <text start="205.42" dur="5.489">slip underneath your shirt and then got</text>
  <text start="209.23" dur="8.929">this type of material so it was heavier</text>
  <text start="210.909" dur="7.25">it&amp;#39;s a fringe of blue so just stick it</text>
  <text start="221.45" dur="4.78">stick it through the hole here</text>
  <text start="224.22" dur="3.57">you</text>
  <text start="226.23" dur="3.81">and I know these don&amp;#39;t look like the</text>
  <text start="227.79" dur="3.63">typical is easy but it&amp;#39;s fulfilling the</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="3.949">commandment because it just has to be a</text>
  <text start="231.42" dur="2.569">fringe of blue</text>
  <text start="236.15" dur="6.73">give it a good length you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.18" dur="5.22">supposed to be a visible witness sorry I</text>
  <text start="242.88" dur="4.41">live in downtown Portland so you hear</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="4.17">those sounds I supposed to be visible</text>
  <text start="247.29" dur="4.44">witness and then you got one fringe and</text>
  <text start="249.57" dur="6.54">then you just repeat the process for all</text>
  <text start="251.73" dur="5.52">four corners and you don&amp;#39;t have to use</text>
  <text start="256.11" dur="2.79">this material you can just use regular</text>
  <text start="257.25" dur="3.93">blue thread if you want I was just</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="4.79">saying my thread kept because it was so</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="4.98">light way to Kipnis getting caught</text>
  <text start="263.69" dur="4.06">between the shirt and my pants and stuff</text>
  <text start="266.16" dur="3.48">and I wasn&amp;#39;t able to see the the fringe</text>
  <text start="267.75" dur="7.82">which sort of defeats the purpose so</text>
  <text start="269.64" dur="5.93">this keeps it nice and</text>
  <text start="275.63" dur="2.84">visible</text>
  <text start="286.4" dur="4.94">and the reason why the woman was healed</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="5.849">is you know there&amp;#39;s several psalms</text>
  <text start="291.34" dur="5.889">psalms of david where David talks about</text>
  <text start="294.229" dur="4.741">the healing and yaws wings and literally</text>
  <text start="297.229" dur="3.75">as you make this catan you&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="298.97" dur="5.28">like wings on either side of your shirt</text>
  <text start="300.979" dur="5.071">you know hence the four corners of these</text>
  <text start="304.25" dur="4.889">like wings with the width is easy the</text>
  <text start="306.05" dur="5.58">fringe people will will come up to you</text>
  <text start="309.139" dur="4.081">and say what what are those what&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="311.63" dur="5.31">poor and then you have an opportunity to</text>
  <text start="313.22" dur="5.64">witness you know tell them about Yahshua</text>
  <text start="316.94" dur="5.91">and how He healed the woman tell them</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="6.929">about the Commandant aura so the</text>
  <text start="322.85" dur="5.49">spiritual application is that these easy</text>
  <text start="325.789" dur="5.371">I mean literally in Yahshua&amp;#39;s case they</text>
  <text start="328.34" dur="6.449">provided healing conduit for his powers</text>
  <text start="331.16" dur="6.6">his spirit so he&amp;#39;ll says virtue went out</text>
  <text start="334.789" dur="4.981">of his body and I believe also in these</text>
  <text start="337.76" dur="3.75">end days Great Tribulation bzz will be a</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="4.619">now for those who are wearing them with</text>
  <text start="341.51" dur="6.74">the right spirit who love yah they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="344.389" dur="7.521">going to act as like a protection keep</text>
  <text start="348.25" dur="8.64">you from harm</text>
  <text start="351.91" dur="6.62">so almost done here i&amp;#39;m doing my because</text>
  <text start="356.89" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s specific that it has to be on the</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="3.82">four corners now some people like to</text>
  <text start="360.76" dur="3.75">just loop them around like men like to</text>
  <text start="362.35" dur="3.51">leave them around belt loops I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="364.51" dur="2.79">really like that because the commandment</text>
  <text start="365.86" dur="4.2">is to actually put it on the four</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="4.5">corners of a garment so and I mean this</text>
  <text start="370.06" dur="5.93">is pretty easy to do and you can wear</text>
  <text start="371.8" dur="7.82">this under any any shirt that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="375.99" dur="3.63">wearing so</text>
  <text start="385.569" dur="2.85">so as you can see there&amp;#39;s both the</text>
  <text start="387.039" dur="2.46">physical application and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="388.419" dur="2.61">spiritual application of this</text>
  <text start="389.499" dur="4.831">commandment and that&amp;#39;s true for all the</text>
  <text start="391.029" dur="4.29">commandments in Torah which by the way</text>
  <text start="394.33" dur="3.389">those commandments are commitments</text>
  <text start="395.319" dur="4.35">Joshua himself Jesus Christ kept so</text>
  <text start="397.719" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re going to be followers of Jesus we</text>
  <text start="399.669" dur="6.411">should do what Jesus did so now we have</text>
  <text start="402.189" dur="7.35">a catan with the fringes on either side</text>
  <text start="406.08" dur="7.109">and there&amp;#39;s healing in the wings we got</text>
  <text start="409.539" dur="7.02">we got wings on either side so</text>

  <text start="420.49" dur="3.479">in his wings and you&amp;#39;ll learn both the</text>
  <text start="422.379" dur="5.76">physical and spiritual application for</text>
