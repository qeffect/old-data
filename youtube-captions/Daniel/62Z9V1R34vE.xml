  <text start="48.239" dur="4.23">could strip away from the students that</text>
  <text start="50.219" dur="4.441">would try to say oh I don&amp;#39;t believe in</text>
  <text start="52.469" dur="4.891">that I&amp;#39;m gonna do and even there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>

  <text start="62.579" dur="4.141">see we can&amp;#39;t rely on it it&amp;#39;s time to end</text>
  <text start="65.25" dur="3.39">all that today so this is what this</text>
  <text start="66.72" dur="3.719">video is gonna be about hallelujah I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="68.64" dur="4.83">gonna be providing links and sources and</text>
  <text start="70.439" dur="4.201">videos to everything I talk about and so</text>
  <text start="73.47" dur="2.52">there&amp;#39;s gonna be a barrage of</text>
  <text start="74.64" dur="4.409">information below this video</text>
  <text start="75.99" dur="5.669">hallelujah let&amp;#39;s get right to it first</text>
  <text start="79.049" dur="5.61">of all veracity the scriptures we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="6.361">gonna start with the Dead Sea Scrolls</text>
  <text start="84.659" dur="6.091">the Dead Sea scrolls were a Scrolls that</text>
  <text start="88.02" dur="5.13">were discovered dated to about 2300</text>
  <text start="90.75" dur="6.03">years ago so about 300 years before the</text>
  <text start="93.15" dur="5.7">time of Messiah and if you they found</text>
  <text start="96.78" dur="5.01">the scroll of Isaiah amidst these</text>
  <text start="98.85" dur="5.19">scrolls okay and if you compare that</text>
  <text start="101.79" dur="4.439">scroll of Isaiah to a modern-day King</text>
  <text start="104.04" dur="4.14">James version of Isaiah the</text>
  <text start="106.229" dur="4.591">discrepancies between the two are</text>
  <text start="108.18" dur="4.02">virtually nil so this whole idea that</text>
  <text start="110.82" dur="3.75">somehow things have been mistranslated</text>
  <text start="112.2" dur="5.61">and misconstrued and we can&amp;#39;t even trust</text>
  <text start="114.57" dur="5.43">what we have they lies lies yaahh said</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="3.72">in his word i will preserve my word from</text>
  <text start="120" dur="3.329">one generation to the next</text>
  <text start="121.53" dur="4.799">the yahood created the heavens and earth</text>
  <text start="123.329" dur="5.281">can easily preserve his work so the Dead</text>
  <text start="126.329" dur="4.8">Sea Scrolls provide absolute proof used</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="4.06">to compare the Isaiah scroll to a</text>
  <text start="131.129" dur="4.181">modern-day King James</text>
  <text start="132.67" dur="4.59">Tyndale Akiva Bible or you know compare</text>
  <text start="135.31" dur="4.14">this to an Isaiah of the scriptures</text>
  <text start="137.26" dur="3.87">today differences between them are</text>
  <text start="139.45" dur="3.119">virtually no now I will say there are</text>
  <text start="141.13" dur="4.05">some bad translations out there under</text>
  <text start="142.569" dur="3.841">the NIV non inspired version there was a</text>
  <text start="145.18" dur="3.69">lesbian on the committee of that</text>
  <text start="146.41" dur="4.98">translations yeah don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t do the NIV</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="3.96">King James is fine guys King James had</text>
  <text start="151.39" dur="3.24">nothing to do with the translation he</text>
  <text start="152.83" dur="4.05">just wanted an ego trip and stamped his</text>
  <text start="154.63" dur="3.689">name on it in terms of the actual</text>
  <text start="156.88" dur="3.24">translation from the Greek taxes</text>
  <text start="158.319" dur="3.541">Receptus and the master edit text had</text>
  <text start="160.12" dur="4.05">nothing to do with anything team changed</text>
  <text start="161.86" dur="4.62">it so anyway so Dead Sea Scrolls</text>
  <text start="164.17" dur="5.819">provides 100% proof that we can look at</text>
  <text start="166.48" dur="6.509">Isaiah no differences between this</text>
  <text start="169.989" dur="4.551">Isaiah scroll dated 2300 years ago and</text>
  <text start="172.989" dur="5.161">what we have in our possession today</text>
  <text start="174.54" dur="5.949">okay next one proof of the scriptures</text>
  <text start="178.15" dur="8.43">and I&amp;#39;m gonna provide video footage of</text>
  <text start="180.489" dur="9.181">this the golden chariot wheels at the</text>
  <text start="186.58" dur="4.98">bottom of the Red Sea this was</text>
  <text start="189.67" dur="4.11">discovered by Ron Wyatt who&amp;#39;s now passed</text>
  <text start="191.56" dur="5.16">away and we have video footage of this</text>
  <text start="193.78" dur="4.86">now these golden chariot wheels gold the</text>
  <text start="196.72" dur="5.01">properties in gold attract the coral so</text>
  <text start="198.64" dur="6.319">the coral preserved many many golden</text>
  <text start="201.73" dur="7.2">travels at the bottom of the Red Sea</text>
  <text start="204.959" dur="5.351">right and and the these chariot wheels</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="3.54">the way they&amp;#39;re shaped and whatnot you</text>
  <text start="210.31" dur="4.62">can trace it to the exact dynasty that</text>
  <text start="212.47" dur="5.13">would have been when Moses walked the</text>
  <text start="214.93" dur="5.22">earth so we have video footage of all</text>
  <text start="217.6" dur="4.859">these wheels on the bottom of the Red</text>
  <text start="220.15" dur="5.49">Sea strewn right where the children of</text>
  <text start="222.459" dur="5.041">Israel crossed over so another really</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="4.98">big proof and and Ron Wyatt by the way a</text>
  <text start="227.5" dur="5.16">lot of proof I mean the preservation of</text>
  <text start="230.62" dur="4.5">Sodom and Gomorrah the discovery of the</text>
  <text start="232.66" dur="4.29">ark in northeastern turkey Plaza but</text>
  <text start="235.12" dur="2.94">this this video footage of the shirt</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="2.849">wheels is one of the most compelling</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="3.989">testimony that when I gave this</text>
  <text start="239.799" dur="4.02">testimony on Portland State University I</text>
  <text start="242.049" dur="3.75">remember a professor he was an atheist</text>
  <text start="243.819" dur="3.631">and he began trembling because he</text>
  <text start="245.799" dur="3.301">realized the truth of the scriptures</text>
  <text start="247.45" dur="3.599">when I started showing this and any and</text>
  <text start="249.1" dur="3">said there&amp;#39;s video footage there&amp;#39;s video</text>
  <text start="251.049" dur="6.75">footage even back then and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="252.1" dur="10.1">link to that ooh yeah next we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="4.401">to go to is proof of the resurrection</text>
  <text start="262.83" dur="3.67">proof of the resurrection of Yahshua or</text>
  <text start="265.51" dur="7.17">Jesus</text>
  <text start="266.5" dur="7.56">yeah 100% proof so first of all and by</text>
  <text start="272.68" dur="3.51">the way you don&amp;#39;t even need to rely on</text>
  <text start="274.06" dur="6.03">the Gospel accounts to establish the</text>
  <text start="276.19" dur="6.21">proof of the resurrection even though I</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="4.35">do believe in the absolute reliable of</text>
  <text start="282.4" dur="5.4">reliability of the Gospel accounts and</text>
  <text start="284.44" dur="5.88">the Brit hadashah but first of all if</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="5.37">this were a made-up story the Gospel</text>
  <text start="290.32" dur="4.17">accounts say that women women discovered</text>
  <text start="293.17" dur="2.64">the Tim it was women who first</text>
  <text start="294.49" dur="3.96">discovered the tomb and that was empty</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="4.32">and that yatra prison now if they were</text>
  <text start="298.45" dur="3.63">trying to fabricate a story they would</text>
  <text start="300.13" dur="4.32">not have said women discovered the tomb</text>
  <text start="302.08" dur="4.47">because a woman&amp;#39;s testimony in the first</text>
  <text start="304.45" dur="2.52">century Jerusalem was worthless it was</text>
  <text start="306.55" dur="2.4">worthless</text>
  <text start="306.97" dur="3.81">they would not even consider a female</text>
  <text start="308.95" dur="4.56">testimony in first century Middle</text>
  <text start="310.78" dur="6.27">Eastern first century Jerusalem and yet</text>
  <text start="313.51" dur="5.37">they say these women miriam magdalene</text>
  <text start="317.05" dur="4.44">maryam the mother of yahshua meant all</text>
  <text start="318.88" dur="5.67">these Marian&amp;#39;s and others discovered the</text>
  <text start="321.49" dur="6.09">empty tomb the fact that they say women</text>
  <text start="324.55" dur="5.61">did so adds credibility to the story but</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="4.8">let&amp;#39;s not stop there</text>
  <text start="330.16" dur="5.58">there&amp;#39;s a man named Paul a theis spelled</text>
  <text start="332.38" dur="5.73">alt H aus he said the tomb had to have</text>
  <text start="335.74" dur="7.02">been an ziyan wine if you go to what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="338.11" dur="7.32">known as the tole death tol de th told F</text>
  <text start="342.76" dur="5.37">Jesu which is a early compilation of</text>
  <text start="345.43" dur="4.02">Jewish writings these Jews were hostile</text>
  <text start="348.13" dur="3.78">witnesses and they were trying to</text>
  <text start="349.45" dur="5.15">explain why the tomb was empty so these</text>
  <text start="351.91" dur="5.009">are hostile witnesses admitting</text>
  <text start="354.6" dur="4.99">admitting that the tomb was empty and</text>
  <text start="356.919" dur="5.101">then this this early compilation of</text>
  <text start="359.59" dur="5.37">writings very early on because either</text>
  <text start="362.02" dur="5.22">first or early second century Jews who</text>
  <text start="364.96" dur="3.51">hated Yahshua did not want to admit he</text>
  <text start="367.24" dur="3.36">was the Messiah and they were trying to</text>
  <text start="368.47" dur="3.66">explain why the tomb was empty so they</text>
  <text start="370.6" dur="4.62">admit these hostile witnesses of a</text>
  <text start="372.13" dur="4.59">hostile witness admit something than any</text>
  <text start="375.22" dur="1.83">court of law says okay then it must be</text>
  <text start="376.72" dur="2.34">true</text>
  <text start="377.05" dur="4.08">they had no vested interest in admitting</text>
  <text start="379.06" dur="3.359">that the tomb was empty okay they could</text>
  <text start="381.13" dur="3.87">have said well this was a made-up story</text>
  <text start="382.419" dur="4.831">or anything but no they admit the tomb</text>
  <text start="385" dur="3.9">was empty hostile witnesses admitting</text>
  <text start="387.25" dur="3.9">the tomb was empty again this is from</text>
  <text start="388.9" dur="5.75">the told of the Gesu you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="391.15" dur="7.68">go to the Gospel accounts to verify this</text>
  <text start="394.65" dur="5.34">now there were over 50 shrines 50</text>
  <text start="398.83" dur="5.22">shrines</text>
  <text start="399.99" dur="6.4">venerating dead bodies of holy men</text>
  <text start="404.05" dur="4.41">Saints all across true Salaam 50 shrines</text>
  <text start="406.39" dur="3.9">in the first century in Jerusalem no</text>
  <text start="408.46" dur="4.8">shrine was ever erected around the tomb</text>
  <text start="410.29" dur="7.68">of Messiah why because there are no</text>
  <text start="413.26" dur="6.54">bones to enshrine now we&amp;#39;ve established</text>
  <text start="417.97" dur="3.45">that there was definitely an empty tomb</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="4.2">without even using the Gospel accounts</text>
  <text start="421.42" dur="4.95">there was definitely an empty tomb so</text>
  <text start="424" dur="5.82">the next question is what happened to</text>
  <text start="426.37" dur="7.17">the body so the Romans and the Jews had</text>
  <text start="429.82" dur="5.43">no motive to steal the body because the</text>
  <text start="433.54" dur="4.2">Romans and the ruling class of the Jews</text>
  <text start="435.25" dur="4.35">all they had to do was produce the dead</text>
  <text start="437.74" dur="4.38">body of Messiah and it would immediately</text>
  <text start="439.6" dur="4.53">kill these disciples shouting out the</text>
  <text start="442.12" dur="4.8">resurrection of Yahshua immediately just</text>
  <text start="444.13" dur="4.53">astray so they had no motive to steal</text>
  <text start="446.92" dur="3">the body they all they would need to do</text>
  <text start="448.66" dur="3.33">is take it out of the tomb which was</text>
  <text start="449.92" dur="4.41">well guarded remember that the penalty</text>
  <text start="451.99" dur="4.56">for a Roman soldier not guarding a tomb</text>
  <text start="454.33" dur="4.89">would be death and there was a whole</text>
  <text start="456.55" dur="4.32">Roman guard around this tomb but they</text>
  <text start="459.22" dur="3.15">they had every reason in the world to</text>
  <text start="460.87" dur="3.63">just produce this dead body it would</text>
  <text start="462.37" dur="3.21">have just stopped anything the disciples</text>
  <text start="464.5" dur="2.43">trying to do about preaching the</text>
  <text start="465.58" dur="3.99">resurrection as it&amp;#39;s recorded in the</text>
  <text start="466.93" dur="5.49">book of Acts so the next story it&amp;#39;s made</text>
  <text start="469.57" dur="4.83">up is well the disciples they stole the</text>
  <text start="472.42" dur="3.06">body well that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense either</text>
  <text start="474.4" dur="2.88">because think about it</text>
  <text start="475.48" dur="3.84">the disciples begin to preach the</text>
  <text start="477.28" dur="3.69">Messiah and not only according to 1st</text>
  <text start="479.32" dur="3.06">century writings but all of the second</text>
  <text start="480.97" dur="3.18">century 3rd century we see that they</text>
  <text start="482.38" dur="4.14">were burned at the stake from to the</text>
  <text start="484.15" dur="4.23">Lions Den made specif above&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="486.52" dur="4.74">persecuted all across the room and</text>
  <text start="488.38" dur="5.28">Empire now if these disciples if these</text>
  <text start="491.26" dur="4.68">12 disciples knew they actually stole</text>
  <text start="493.66" dur="3.63">that body and they burned it or buried</text>
  <text start="495.94" dur="3.72">it or whatever and they knew he never</text>
  <text start="497.29" dur="5.28">resurrected why would they be willing to</text>
  <text start="499.66" dur="5.1">be crucified and stoned and killed for</text>
  <text start="502.57" dur="4.02">something they knew to be a lie now</text>
  <text start="504.76" dur="3.42">people can be deceived they can follow</text>
  <text start="506.59" dur="3.36">something that they really lose true and</text>
  <text start="508.18" dur="2.97">it&amp;#39;s a delusion but we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="509.95" dur="2.85">the disciples they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="511.15" dur="3.3">disciples actually stole a body they</text>
  <text start="512.8" dur="4.14">knew it wasn&amp;#39;t a delusion they took the</text>
  <text start="514.45" dur="3.719">body they they burned it or buried or</text>
  <text start="516.94" dur="3.42">whoever and then they went out and</text>
  <text start="518.169" dur="4.5">preached this lie and got crucified for</text>
  <text start="520.36" dur="3.869">it no man in history would do that show</text>
  <text start="522.669" dur="4.231">me one example in all of history where</text>
  <text start="524.229" dur="4.501">someone knew 100% fact that something</text>
  <text start="526.9" dur="5.64">was a lie and they&amp;#39;re willing to die for</text>
  <text start="528.73" dur="4.59">it doesn&amp;#39;t happen doesn&amp;#39;t happen so the</text>
  <text start="532.54" dur="3.21">only explanation</text>
  <text start="533.32" dur="4.58">this empty tomb Yahshua rose from the</text>
  <text start="535.75" dur="4.26">dead hallelujah</text>
  <text start="537.9" dur="3.25">there&amp;#39;s a lot more resources about this</text>
  <text start="540.01" dur="4.34">I&amp;#39;m gonna post even more links and</text>
  <text start="541.15" dur="8.48">information about this as well okay</text>
  <text start="544.35" dur="7.54">let&amp;#39;s move on scriptures are 100% true</text>
  <text start="549.63" dur="4.27">of course you got to be led by the Ruach</text>
  <text start="551.89" dur="3.36">when you read the scriptures otherwise</text>
  <text start="553.9" dur="3.18">it&amp;#39;s just going to convict you and tell</text>
  <text start="555.25" dur="4.14">you how wicked you are which is good</text>
  <text start="557.08" dur="4.02">because when you admit how wicked you</text>
  <text start="559.39" dur="3">are that&amp;#39;s the first step to</text>
  <text start="561.1" dur="4.41">acknowledging that you need a messiah to</text>
  <text start="562.39" dur="4.77">save you but you can&amp;#39;t really understand</text>
  <text start="565.51" dur="3.15">and really delve in the scriptures</text>
  <text start="567.16" dur="4.02">unless you have always spirit guiding</text>
  <text start="568.66" dur="4.11">you but there is absolute proof that</text>
  <text start="571.18" dur="3.65">this scripture is true there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="572.77" dur="4.2">any atheist agnostic or anyone out there</text>
  <text start="574.83" dur="3.34">should deny the veracity of the</text>
  <text start="576.97" dur="2.67">scriptures including many of you</text>
  <text start="578.17" dur="3.06">subscribers you&amp;#39;ve set out B I know we</text>
  <text start="579.64" dur="3.6">can&amp;#39;t trust the scriptures oh yes you</text>
  <text start="581.23" dur="4.59">can just don&amp;#39;t get bogged down in all</text>
  <text start="583.24" dur="5.22">those false and Gnostic Gospels and all</text>
  <text start="585.82" dur="6.69">that other books that have nothing to do</text>
  <text start="588.46" dur="7.23">with the scriptures okay so now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="592.51" dur="4.17">gonna go on to proof of the age of the</text>
  <text start="595.69" dur="8.49">earth first of all we&amp;#39;re going to talk</text>
  <text start="596.68" dur="8.91">about a man named Mark Armitage mark</text>
  <text start="604.18" dur="3.93">Bohnert says under providing a lot of</text>
  <text start="605.59" dur="8.34">links and information about this man he</text>
  <text start="608.11" dur="8.27">actually discovered soft tissue in the</text>
  <text start="613.93" dur="6.02">bone of a I think it was a triceratops</text>
  <text start="616.38" dur="6.49">soft tissue of a bone of a dinosaur</text>
  <text start="619.95" dur="4.45">you know evolutionists say dinosaurs</text>
  <text start="622.87" dur="3.96">existed millions and millions of years</text>
  <text start="624.4" dur="5.7">ago couldn&amp;#39;t happen if we discover soft</text>
  <text start="626.83" dur="5.49">tissue of a tricot triceratops horn and</text>
  <text start="630.1" dur="5.97">he discovered this on a variety of</text>
  <text start="632.32" dur="8.87">information about Mark Armitage number</text>
  <text start="636.07" dur="5.12">two we&amp;#39;ve got irreducible complexity</text>
  <text start="642.36" dur="11.71">Michael Behe who wrote a book called</text>
  <text start="646.95" dur="8.86">Darwin&amp;#39;s black box he shows how for</text>
  <text start="654.07" dur="4.17">instance an eyeball is irreducibly</text>
  <text start="655.81" dur="4.65">complex so the human eyeball has over</text>
  <text start="658.24" dur="3.72">200 components and it has to have each</text>
  <text start="660.46" dur="3.03">and every one of those components in</text>
  <text start="661.96" dur="3.06">order to function in order to for us to</text>
  <text start="663.49" dur="3">perceive things with the human eye</text>
  <text start="665.02" dur="1.74">there&amp;#39;s no way that it could have</text>
  <text start="666.49" dur="2.76">grabbed</text>
  <text start="666.76" dur="4.11">evolved with one part in another because</text>
  <text start="669.25" dur="3.15">it wouldn&amp;#39;t be an eyeball it wouldn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="670.87" dur="4.41">wouldn&amp;#39;t perform the functional eyeball</text>
  <text start="672.4" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s irreducibly complex this is the</text>
  <text start="675.28" dur="4.17">same thing with the DNA strand the DNA</text>
  <text start="678.22" dur="3.14">strand was actually discovered by two</text>
  <text start="679.45" dur="4.62">atheists Francis Crick and James Watson</text>
  <text start="681.36" dur="4.78">and even they when they first discovered</text>
  <text start="684.07" dur="4.53">the DNA strand even they as a penis</text>
  <text start="686.14" dur="4.89">admitted that the DNA strand is so</text>
  <text start="688.6" dur="4.11">complex and has so many you know it has</text>
  <text start="691.03" dur="3.12">to be in a certain sequence of the code</text>
  <text start="692.71" dur="5.22">in order for that DNA strand to work</text>
  <text start="694.15" dur="5.25">that the only way to explain this is an</text>
  <text start="697.93" dur="3.81">intelligent designer had to have</text>
  <text start="699.4" dur="5.22">constructed this DNA strand and because</text>
  <text start="701.74" dur="5.04">they were atheists they could not even</text>
  <text start="704.62" dur="5.19">begin to acknowledge the God of Bible so</text>
  <text start="706.78" dur="5.73">they suggested this dumb theory called</text>
  <text start="709.81" dur="4.38">panspermia in which these aliens came to</text>
  <text start="712.51" dur="3.87">earth many many thousands of years ago</text>
  <text start="714.19" dur="4.11">or millions of years ago and planted the</text>
  <text start="716.38" dur="3.96">seeds of human civilization but even</text>
  <text start="718.3" dur="5.28">these atheists had to admit that because</text>
  <text start="720.34" dur="4.98">of the biological complexity of the DNA</text>
  <text start="723.58" dur="3.38">strand that there had to be an</text>
  <text start="725.32" dur="3.66">intelligent designer</text>
  <text start="726.96" dur="3.79">Darwin&amp;#39;s black box you get a chance to</text>
  <text start="728.98" dur="4.17">read this excellent I actually got the</text>
  <text start="730.75" dur="4.83">fear Michael Behe lecture in person when</text>
  <text start="733.15" dur="4.74">I was attending a university Gutenberg</text>
  <text start="735.58" dur="6.18">down in Eugene and a really great guy</text>
  <text start="737.89" dur="5.55">okay although I think he&amp;#39;s Catholic sir</text>
  <text start="741.76" dur="7.47">doesn&amp;#39;t need to repent of that okay so</text>
  <text start="743.44" dur="8.31">now next we got the 6000 years the earth</text>
  <text start="749.23" dur="4.14">is only 6,000 years old this is very</text>
  <text start="751.75" dur="3.42">important not only for a scientific</text>
  <text start="753.37" dur="3.96">perspective but a spiritual perspective</text>
  <text start="755.17" dur="3.99">because we work six days and on the</text>
  <text start="757.33" dur="2.31">seventh day today being the Shabbat we</text>
  <text start="759.16" dur="2.34">rest</text>
  <text start="759.64" dur="3.36">well that&amp;#39;s trying to be undermined by</text>
  <text start="761.5" dur="3.24">the evolutionist and even many on the</text>
  <text start="763" dur="4.02">Christian side who believe in this Old</text>
  <text start="764.74" dur="4.14">Earth know the Earth&amp;#39;s only 6,000 years</text>
  <text start="767.02" dur="3.96">old or just a little under that</text>
  <text start="768.88" dur="6.3">according to the framework that we read</text>
  <text start="770.98" dur="6.3">in Genesis the you know the the</text>
  <text start="775.18" dur="4.32">ancestral how how do you figure out the</text>
  <text start="777.28" dur="4.02">when people were born and dying stuff in</text>
  <text start="779.5" dur="3.93">green Genesis it&amp;#39;s only about a little</text>
  <text start="781.3" dur="3.99">under 6,000 years old we&amp;#39;re on the verge</text>
  <text start="783.43" dur="3.15">of entering the Sabbath millennium which</text>
  <text start="785.29" dur="1.86">will happen once we get to the Great</text>
  <text start="786.58" dur="2.91">Tribulation</text>
  <text start="787.15" dur="3.93">but it&amp;#39;s only 6,000 years old and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="789.49" dur="3.09">one of the reasons because people are</text>
  <text start="791.08" dur="3.48">like yeah I know come on the earth</text>
  <text start="792.58" dur="3.66">cannot be sick it&amp;#39;s gotta be billions of</text>
  <text start="794.56" dur="2.01">years it&amp;#39;s got to be 4.5 billion years</text>
  <text start="796.24" dur="2.85">old</text>
  <text start="796.57" dur="3.79">no it doesn&amp;#39;t let&amp;#39;s talk about the</text>
  <text start="799.09" dur="7.729">recession</text>
  <text start="800.36" dur="8.769">of the moon the recession of the moon</text>
  <text start="806.819" dur="4.08">what that means is that the moon every</text>
  <text start="809.129" dur="3.51">year is getting farther and farther away</text>
  <text start="810.899" dur="3">from the earth as it orbits it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="812.639" dur="4.17">farther and farther away from the earth</text>
  <text start="813.899" dur="6.24">every year incrementally you can only</text>
  <text start="816.809" dur="6.84">wind back the clock about 1.5 million</text>
  <text start="820.139" dur="5.13">years and the moon will be so close to</text>
  <text start="823.649" dur="3.54">the earth that it would literally touch</text>
  <text start="825.269" dur="3.18">the earth which is impossible and yet</text>
  <text start="827.189" dur="3.44">evolutionists want us to believe that</text>
  <text start="828.449" dur="5.43">the moon is 4.5 billion years old</text>
  <text start="830.629" dur="5.981">impossible at the rate that the moon is</text>
  <text start="833.879" dur="4.531">moving from the earth if the Earth&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="836.61" dur="3.389">only 6,000 years old there&amp;#39;s no problem</text>
  <text start="838.41" dur="7.019">would only move moved I think about 800</text>
  <text start="839.999" dur="6.81">meters I believe check on that but 1.5</text>
  <text start="845.429" dur="2.88">million years ago the moon would have</text>
  <text start="846.809" dur="3">been so close to the earth at its</text>
  <text start="848.309" dur="3.931">current rate of getting farther from the</text>
  <text start="849.809" dur="3.87">earth if you wind back the clock 1.5</text>
  <text start="852.24" dur="2.939">million years ago the moon would have</text>
  <text start="853.679" dur="3.84">been so close to the earth it would have</text>
  <text start="855.179" dur="5.52">touched the earth okay that would be</text>
  <text start="857.519" dur="5.221">impossible so according to the recession</text>
  <text start="860.699" dur="4.62">of the moon there&amp;#39;s no way the moon was</text>
  <text start="862.74" dur="5.039">made 4.5 billion years ago along with it</text>
  <text start="865.319" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s just not possible so this framework</text>
  <text start="867.779" dur="4.47">this long older framework it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="869.759" dur="3.93">ridiculous and there&amp;#39;s a lot of other</text>
  <text start="872.249" dur="2.58">fruit - I could go into but I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="873.689" dur="2.31">going to stick with the recession of the</text>
  <text start="874.829" dur="2.911">moon and I&amp;#39;m gonna provide other links</text>
  <text start="875.999" dur="4.2">to really get into detail on this I got</text>
  <text start="877.74" dur="4.86">a lot of technical scientific stuff that</text>
  <text start="880.199" dur="7.531">goes way more into the workings of the</text>
  <text start="882.6" dur="8.31">recession of the moon okay do-do do-do I</text>
  <text start="887.73" dur="5.669">think that was all mine I think that was</text>
  <text start="890.91" dur="4.08">all my notes so a lot of great arguments</text>
  <text start="893.399" dur="3.36">a lot of great apologetics again the</text>
  <text start="894.99" dur="4.259">main focus of course like what I did the</text>
  <text start="896.759" dur="4.26">white house is to exalt Yahshua to make</text>
  <text start="899.249" dur="4.02">sure the Holy Spirit&amp;#39;s blink convicting</text>
  <text start="901.019" dur="3.391">sinners every crowd is different every</text>
  <text start="903.269" dur="3.78">situation ever societies have to be</text>
  <text start="904.41" dur="4.529">bathed in prayer but these are a lot of</text>
  <text start="907.049" dur="4.14">good things that people and you guys can</text>
  <text start="908.939" dur="4.77">use to to stand firm in your faith and</text>
  <text start="911.189" dur="4.231">to know that the Scriptures are true the</text>
  <text start="913.709" dur="5.19">Yahshua rose from the dead that the</text>
  <text start="915.42" dur="6.449">earth is young and that the truth is</text>
  <text start="918.899" dur="6.86">never scared of the lies hallelujah</text>
