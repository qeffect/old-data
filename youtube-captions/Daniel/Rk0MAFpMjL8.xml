  <text start="61.68" dur="6.75">those those references so the early</text>
  <text start="64.71" dur="5.55">first century Church did observe the</text>
  <text start="68.43" dur="4.02">feast of Passover the feast of</text>
  <text start="70.26" dur="4.289">unleavened bread and first fruits and</text>
  <text start="72.45" dur="4.8">you can go even into the second century</text>
  <text start="74.549" dur="6.39">you can read about Polycarp who is a</text>
  <text start="77.25" dur="7.979">disciple of the Apostle John polycarb</text>
  <text start="80.939" dur="7.29">lived in the late first early second</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="5.121">half of the second early half of the</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="6.121">first half of the 2nd century and</text>
  <text start="90.35" dur="5.86">there&amp;#39;s a actually a debate called the I</text>
  <text start="94.35" dur="5.37">think it&amp;#39;s called the quadro seein</text>
  <text start="96.21" dur="5.88">debate that Polycarp had with with</text>
  <text start="99.72" dur="5.34">another bishop from blue it was either</text>
  <text start="102.09" dur="5.43">Rome or Alexander in which there was a</text>
  <text start="105.06" dur="4.589">debate about when the Passover should be</text>
  <text start="107.52" dur="3.629">observed and of course Polycarp who was</text>
  <text start="109.649" dur="3.321">a disciple of John insisted that it</text>
  <text start="111.149" dur="4.591">would happen on the fourteenth day of</text>
  <text start="112.97" dur="5.89">the new moon which of course was</text>
  <text start="115.74" dur="6">yesterday so even as late as the 2nd</text>
  <text start="118.86" dur="5.73">century we see that the early Christians</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="4.29">the early church was observing Passover</text>
  <text start="124.59" dur="4.35">the feast of unleavened bread and</text>
  <text start="126.03" dur="6.24">firstfruits they were not in any way</text>
  <text start="128.94" dur="4.01">observing Easter the word Easter is used</text>
  <text start="132.27" dur="4.1">once the</text>
  <text start="132.95" dur="5.119">backs but it&amp;#39;s actually a miss miss miss</text>
  <text start="136.37" dur="3.96">translation should not be the word</text>
  <text start="138.069" dur="7.211">Eastern actually should be the word pass</text>
  <text start="140.33" dur="6.689">over a pesach but this is the feast that</text>
  <text start="145.28" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re to keep so today is the first day</text>
  <text start="147.019" dur="5.341">of unleavened bread and this these days</text>
  <text start="150.68" dur="3.75">of unleavened bread last for seven days</text>
  <text start="152.36" dur="3.78">we don&amp;#39;t eat any bread with leaven we</text>
  <text start="154.43" dur="4.29">only if we want to have bread it has to</text>
  <text start="156.14" dur="5.06">be unleavened bread we make sure that</text>
  <text start="158.72" dur="6">all 11 all yeast all products that are</text>
  <text start="161.2" dur="5.2">used in Lebanon or to make bread puff up</text>
  <text start="164.72" dur="5.28">is cashed out of our dwelling place</text>
  <text start="166.4" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s nowhere to be found and we make</text>
  <text start="170" dur="4.049">sure that we don&amp;#39;t eat anything with</text>
  <text start="171.47" dur="4.349">lemon for seven days because it says in</text>
  <text start="174.049" dur="2.97">the scripture that whosoever does that</text>
  <text start="175.819" dur="3.901">will be cut off from the children of</text>
  <text start="177.019" dur="4.621">Israel so it&amp;#39;s a very serious penalty if</text>
  <text start="179.72" dur="4.41">you eat Levin during these next seven</text>
  <text start="181.64" dur="5">days which are this year from April</text>
  <text start="184.13" dur="6.96">fourth until April the end of April 10th</text>
  <text start="186.64" dur="5.95">2015 it is seven days long seven of</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="3.69">course being the perfect number in</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="6.54">Scripture seven is the number of the</text>
  <text start="194.78" dur="6.48">Sabbath completion rest Yas perfect</text>
  <text start="199.13" dur="3.3">number took sep six days to create the</text>
  <text start="201.26" dur="4.05">heavens earth on the seventh day he</text>
  <text start="202.43" dur="5.339">rested so seven does symbolize the</text>
  <text start="205.31" dur="6.12">perfection of yacht so it&amp;#39;s a seven day</text>
  <text start="207.769" dur="6.991">feast the first day which is today April</text>
  <text start="211.43" dur="4.679">fourth technically it goes from the</text>
  <text start="214.76" dur="2.61">evening of april third of the evening</text>
  <text start="216.109" dur="3.69">April fourth is the first day of</text>
  <text start="217.37" dur="4.739">unleavened bread the first day is a high</text>
  <text start="219.799" dur="3.69">Sabbath that means no matter what day of</text>
  <text start="222.109" dur="4.051">the week that this day happens to fall</text>
  <text start="223.489" dur="4.201">on it will always be a shabbat so this</text>
  <text start="226.16" dur="3.51">year of course it happens to fall on the</text>
  <text start="227.69" dur="5.25">weekly sabbath itself so it&amp;#39;s sort of a</text>
  <text start="229.67" dur="5.34">double shabbat it&amp;#39;s a sabbath day as it</text>
  <text start="232.94" dur="4.169">would be any other year but it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="235.01" dur="3.99">high Sabbath and then seven days from</text>
  <text start="237.109" dur="4.111">today which will be friday april 10th</text>

  <text start="241.22" dur="3.9">evening until friday april tons of</text>
  <text start="242.989" dur="4.201">evening that will be the seventh day of</text>
  <text start="245.12" dur="4.26">unleavened bread so that friday even</text>
  <text start="247.19" dur="4.949">though normally in a normal week friday</text>
  <text start="249.38" dur="4.199">would be a work day friday is a sabbath</text>
  <text start="252.139" dur="3.451">it&amp;#39;s a high Sabbath that means it is</text>
  <text start="253.579" dur="3.72">just like a weekly Sabbath but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="255.59" dur="4.38">on necessarily the seventh</text>
  <text start="257.299" dur="4.951">day of the week so next Friday April</text>
  <text start="259.97" dur="4.439">10th we are not to go to our jobs or not</text>
  <text start="262.25" dur="3.389">to work we&amp;#39;re not to buy and sell we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="264.409" dur="4.79">not going to do anything that would</text>
  <text start="265.639" dur="5.611">involve any type of work or money</text>

  <text start="271.25" dur="6.78">treated as a Sabbath the feast of</text>
  <text start="275.33" dur="5.1">unleavened bread was fulfilled by Joshua</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="5.46">by Jesus of course we know how it</text>
  <text start="280.43" dur="6.12">started it began well before the time of</text>
  <text start="283.49" dur="4.95">Jesus back when Israel was delivered</text>
  <text start="286.55" dur="4.019">from Egypt on the night of Passover</text>
  <text start="288.44" dur="4.979">which would have been this last night</text>
  <text start="290.569" dur="4.291">here that we had the Blood Moon the</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="3.21">Israelites literally because they were</text>
  <text start="294.86" dur="3.239">forced out of Egypt by the Egyptians</text>
  <text start="296.629" dur="3.241">they wanted them out fair one in the</text>
  <text start="298.099" dur="3.391">mouth they were not able they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="299.87" dur="3.84">have time to bring leaven with them or</text>
  <text start="301.49" dur="3.51">to cook and bake the breads that it</text>
  <text start="303.71" dur="3.9">could rise so all their bread was on</text>
  <text start="305" dur="4.49">Lebanon of course this became the feast</text>
  <text start="307.61" dur="4.619">of unleavened bread this is to remind</text>
  <text start="309.49" dur="4.269">the children of Israel how and what man</text>
  <text start="312.229" dur="3.361">are they left that they were literally</text>
  <text start="313.759" dur="3.84">kind of kicked out forced out they were</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="3.78">able to plunder the Egyptians because</text>
  <text start="317.599" dur="3.711">the Egyptians threw up on them gold and</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="4.949">silver and jewels and said just get out</text>
  <text start="321.31" dur="4.93">and so it was a great night of both</text>
  <text start="324.319" dur="4.741">sorrow for the wicked but great joy for</text>
  <text start="326.24" dur="4.5">the righteous and the feast of</text>
  <text start="329.06" dur="4.02">unleavened bread stretches for seven</text>
  <text start="330.74" dur="3.69">days during that first feast of</text>
  <text start="333.08" dur="3.269">unleavened bread on the first day was</text>
  <text start="334.43" dur="4.95">when that night they left and they</text>
  <text start="336.349" dur="5.81">traveled and they departed out from</text>
  <text start="339.38" dur="5.159">where they had been living in Egypt and</text>
  <text start="342.159" dur="4.391">during the midst of those seven days by</text>
  <text start="344.539" dur="7.47">the third day of unleavened bread they</text>
  <text start="346.55" dur="7.919">were trapped by the Red Sea and Pharaohs</text>
  <text start="352.009" dur="4.02">armies the third day going into the</text>
  <text start="354.469" dur="4.471">fourth day was when they crossed the Red</text>
  <text start="356.029" dur="4.29">Sea and by the seventh day then they</text>
  <text start="358.94" dur="3.839">spend out of the three days traveling</text>
  <text start="360.319" dur="4.051">into the wilderness of sin and by the</text>
  <text start="362.779" dur="3.36">seventh day of unleavened bread the next</text>
  <text start="364.37" dur="3.509">high shabbat they they found this</text>
  <text start="366.139" dur="4.62">beautiful place with 70 palm trees and</text>
  <text start="367.879" dur="6.481">pools of water and and they were able to</text>
  <text start="370.759" dur="5.25">rest and then the first Passover that</text>
  <text start="374.36" dur="5.1">they kept in the promised land in the</text>
  <text start="376.009" dur="4.831">time of Joshua 40 years later they kept</text>
  <text start="379.46" dur="4.019">it at the banks of the Jordan River</text>
  <text start="380.84" dur="3.87">after they crossed it and then the seven</text>
  <text start="383.479" dur="3">days of unleavened bread they spent</text>
  <text start="384.71" dur="4.37">marching around the walls of Jericho and</text>
  <text start="386.479" dur="4.31">on the seventh day of</text>
  <text start="389.08" dur="4.619">than bread the high Sabbath of course</text>
  <text start="390.789" dur="5.611">the people shouted on the seventh time</text>

  <text start="396.4" dur="4.169">with the seven trumpets and the walls</text>
  <text start="398.289" dur="5.241">came tumbling down so that&amp;#39;s a good day</text>
  <text start="400.569" dur="5.28">of praise and worship unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="403.53" dur="4.539">when you buy unleavened bread at the</text>
  <text start="405.849" dur="5.16">store it is typically striped and</text>

  <text start="421.84" dur="3.569">they left Egypt hallett if you dripped</text>
  <text start="423.46" dur="4.23">what it was all about but it was also</text>
  <text start="425.409" dur="4.681">pointing toward when Yahshua came</text>
  <text start="427.69" dur="4.56">because Yahshua as he demonstrated</text>
  <text start="430.09" dur="4.199">during the Last Supper which is the</text>
