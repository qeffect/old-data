  <text start="117.259" dur="5.161">the Armada took three years to get there</text>
  <text start="119.96" dur="3.78">and back but Solomon made these very</text>
  <text start="122.42" dur="5.729">probable ships you can read about it in</text>
  <text start="123.74" dur="6.09">the scriptures and when when Israel fell</text>
  <text start="128.149" dur="3.06">into captivity you know first the the</text>
  <text start="129.83" dur="3.689">northern tribes fell into captivity</text>
  <text start="131.209" dur="4.411">through Syria and then of course Judah</text>
  <text start="133.519" dur="5.491">and Benjamin and Levi were taken captive</text>
  <text start="135.62" dur="5.22">later by Babylon but a lot of these</text>
  <text start="139.01" dur="4.53">tribes you know there&amp;#39;s twelve tribes of</text>
  <text start="140.84" dur="4.739">Israel a lot of them wound up after</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="3.24">being held in captivity for getting</text>
  <text start="145.579" dur="3.481">their identity they&amp;#39;ll end up migrating</text>
  <text start="146.78" dur="4.14">across the world and some of them</text>
  <text start="149.06" dur="4.2">migrated as as the early Native</text>
  <text start="150.92" dur="5.43">Americans who crossed over into North</text>
  <text start="153.26" dur="4.47">America and while they did start getting</text>
  <text start="156.35" dur="3.33">into paganism you know they started</text>
  <text start="157.73" dur="5.22">worshiping the creation rather than the</text>
  <text start="159.68" dur="6.45">Creator they did still have remnants of</text>
  <text start="162.95" dur="4.71">the truth and this is not just a Native</text>
  <text start="166.13" dur="3.87">American cultures it&amp;#39;s also if you go to</text>
  <text start="167.66" dur="4.32">Japan they have this ceremony every year</text>
  <text start="170" dur="3.45">in Japanese culture where they bring out</text>

  <text start="175.519" dur="4.5">every year you see it in so many</text>
  <text start="178.16" dur="5.13">cultures this is why the scripture says</text>
  <text start="180.019" dur="6.121">that through Abraham all all people</text>
  <text start="183.29" dur="4.289">would be blessed you know that his seed</text>
  <text start="186.14" dur="4.14">has been mingled throughout the entire</text>
  <text start="187.579" dur="6.181">world that&amp;#39;s why any human being on the</text>
  <text start="190.28" dur="5.519">planet is allowed to be grafted in to</text>
  <text start="193.76" dur="6.33">the to the Commonwealth of Israel by the</text>
  <text start="195.799" dur="5.94">blood of Yahshua anyone because really</text>

  <text start="214.67" dur="4.11">Israel the Jews are only 1/12 and</text>
  <text start="216.939" dur="4.241">furthermore even if you&amp;#39;re just a</text>
  <text start="218.78" dur="4.319">complete Gentile you&amp;#39;ve never don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="221.18" dur="4.05">any bloodline associated with with</text>
  <text start="223.099" dur="5.48">Israel it doesn&amp;#39;t matter because</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="7.83">according to Ephesians 2 and Exodus 12 a</text>
  <text start="228.579" dur="6.88">foreigner a Gentile through the blood of</text>
  <text start="233.06" dur="4.47">Messiah we could be grafted into Israel</text>
