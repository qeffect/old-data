  <text start="4.89" dur="5.61">is Aviv 10 April 10th 2014 and it is</text>
  <text start="8.97" dur="3.299">lamb day the day that we were to select</text>
  <text start="10.5" dur="4.309">our lambs in preparation for the</text>
  <text start="12.269" dur="4.861">Passover which will begin in four days I</text>
  <text start="14.809" dur="5.041">waited until Aviv 10 to make my next</text>
  <text start="17.13" dur="6.54">video because I do need to humble myself</text>
  <text start="19.85" dur="6.099">it appears that I said thus saith yah on</text>
  <text start="23.67" dur="5.609">my website that the two witnesses would</text>
  <text start="25.949" dur="4.92">come forth on Aviv 10 2014 that the</text>
  <text start="29.279" dur="5.311">woman would be in the safe place by</text>
  <text start="30.869" dur="7.741">vivre 10 2014 because i was expecting</text>
  <text start="34.59" dur="5.489">Yahshua to return in 2017 I began to</text>
  <text start="38.61" dur="2.879">realize something was off though when I</text>
  <text start="40.079" dur="5.91">saw that the abomination of desolation</text>
  <text start="41.489" dur="7.41">did not occur in March March 11th as I</text>
  <text start="45.989" dur="4.531">as I thought it would and what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="48.899" dur="3.3">learned from all this is that I need to</text>
  <text start="50.52" dur="4.71">be much more careful that when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="52.199" dur="5.641">dealing with prophecy that and prophetic</text>
  <text start="55.23" dur="5.07">things that I need to say well this is</text>
  <text start="57.84" dur="3.75">what I strongly believe that the word is</text>
  <text start="60.3" dur="3.66">indicating that the scriptures are</text>
  <text start="61.59" dur="6.349">indicating but to refrain from the</text>
  <text start="63.96" dur="6.53">Savior in these in these circumstances</text>
  <text start="67.939" dur="4.961">however I do want to point something out</text>
  <text start="70.49" dur="4.33">people have been saying Oh Daniel you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="3.93">a false prophet your false prophet you</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="3.33">know if you go to the book of</text>
  <text start="76.83" dur="3.03">Deuteronomy and you look at the</text>
  <text start="78.15" dur="4.88">scriptures dealing with false prophets</text>
  <text start="79.86" dur="6.84">these are people who are trying to lead</text>
  <text start="83.03" dur="6.46">the body of Messiah away from Yahshua</text>
  <text start="86.7" dur="5.01">away from his word my entire ministry</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="5.25">tour restoration ministries is all about</text>
  <text start="91.71" dur="4.83">encouraging people to obey His Word to</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="3.57">keep his Commandments out of a love for</text>
  <text start="96.54" dur="3.99">Yahshua that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to do in</text>
  <text start="98.31" dur="4.379">fact even in all my prophetic stuff that</text>
  <text start="100.53" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;ve written and made YouTube&amp;#39;s about i</text>
  <text start="102.689" dur="3.841">constantly have numerous times have said</text>
  <text start="104.85" dur="3.54">look all of this prophetic stuff means</text>
  <text start="106.53" dur="4.379">nothing if it&amp;#39;s not encouraging you to</text>
  <text start="108.39" dur="5.24">live holy to lay down your sin and to</text>
  <text start="110.909" dur="5.011">love Yahshua with everything in you so</text>
  <text start="113.63" dur="3.79">in the technical sense of the word at</text>
  <text start="115.92" dur="3.72">least in that sense I don&amp;#39;t fit the</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="3.51">definition of a false prophet yes I</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="3.57">obviously do need to be more careful</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="4.049">about saying that safe yeah when it</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="4.56">comes prophetic things I&amp;#39;m going to be</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="5.01">centering on encouraging people to obey</text>
  <text start="127.77" dur="2.64">Torah to keep his Commandments out of a</text>
  <text start="129.989" dur="1.651">love for</text>
  <text start="130.41" dur="3.45">yeah which is what this whole ministry</text>
  <text start="131.64" dur="3.75">is about living holy living pure serving</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="4.71">him and when it comes to prophetic</text>
  <text start="135.39" dur="4.92">things such as when Yahshua is returning</text>
  <text start="138.57" dur="3.3">I&amp;#39;ll just talk about well this is this</text>
  <text start="140.31" dur="3.36">is what I strongly believe this is what</text>
  <text start="141.87" dur="4.35">the scripture seemed indicate and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="143.67" dur="5.82">see we&amp;#39;ll see what happens it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="146.22" dur="4.71">humbling experience but I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="149.49" dur="3.42">continue to tell you people out there</text>
  <text start="150.93" dur="4.11">that you need to obey his Torah out of a</text>
  <text start="152.91" dur="5.12">love for him which of course part of a</text>
  <text start="155.04" dur="5.04">bang Torah includes humbling yourself</text>
  <text start="158.03" dur="3.25">when you&amp;#39;ve done something wrong which</text>
  <text start="160.08" dur="2.79">is what I&amp;#39;m doing in this video right</text>
  <text start="161.28" dur="3.18">now I&amp;#39;m humbling myself publicly saying</text>
  <text start="162.87" dur="4.71">hey I was wrong I shouldn&amp;#39;t have done</text>
  <text start="164.46" dur="6.48">that obviously when I said the Savior it</text>
  <text start="167.58" dur="5.34">didn&amp;#39;t happen so I&amp;#39;ve learned from this</text>
  <text start="170.94" dur="6.33">and I&amp;#39;m going to pick myself up and</text>
  <text start="172.92" dur="6.15">continue on from here it appears i&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="177.27" dur="3.75">exactly sure what&amp;#39;s going on with in</text>
  <text start="179.07" dur="3.45">terms of the prophetic stuff in terms of</text>
  <text start="181.02" dur="4.68">when Yahshua is coming it appears that</text>
  <text start="182.52" dur="6.57">it might be that i&amp;#39;m a year off that the</text>
  <text start="185.7" dur="5.27">stuff might happened next aviv aviv 2015</text>
  <text start="189.09" dur="4.97">because i know that the two witnesses</text>
  <text start="190.97" dur="5.53">are going to pete preached for 1260 days</text>
  <text start="194.06" dur="5.8">and i know that when their resurrected</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="5.37">that&amp;#39;s the same event as the rapture or</text>
  <text start="199.86" dur="4.19">the resurrection of the believers that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="201.87" dur="4.92">very very clear in Revelation chapter 11</text>
  <text start="204.05" dur="6.49">and what&amp;#39;s interesting is that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.79" dur="5.88">always 1260 days between aviv 10 and</text>
  <text start="210.54" dur="4.32">then yom teruah three and a half years</text>
  <text start="212.67" dur="4.77">later that fits the pattern like every</text>
  <text start="214.86" dur="5.79">time or at least every time that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="217.44" dur="5.82">been able to discover it so or that I</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="4.89">verified it so maybe the two witnesses</text>
  <text start="223.26" dur="4.89">will come forth next year on a vivre 10</text>
  <text start="225.54" dur="5.01">2015 and Yahshua wound up returning in</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="3.72">2018 that&amp;#39;s one possibility there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="230.55" dur="2.85">other things that I&amp;#39;m looking at two and</text>
  <text start="231.87" dur="3.839">praying about I&amp;#39;m going to be studying</text>
  <text start="233.4" dur="4.17">with my brothers and sisters the Messiah</text>
  <text start="235.709" dur="3.301">during the upcoming feast of Passover</text>

  <text start="241.02" dur="3.39">close we&amp;#39;re definitely in the end times</text>
  <text start="242.67" dur="3.48">Yahshua is coming back and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="244.41" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s more important than ever to make</text>
  <text start="246.15" dur="5.309">sure that our clothing is clean is white</text>
  <text start="249.42" dur="4.319">is pure and that we are doing all we can</text>
  <text start="251.459" dur="4.051">to serve Yahshua to put a smile on his</text>
