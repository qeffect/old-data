  <text start="21.75" dur="4.289">man should blame us in this abundance</text>
  <text start="23.64" dur="4.02">which is administered by us providing</text>
  <text start="26.039" dur="3.591">for honest things not only in the sight</text>
  <text start="27.66" dur="4.019">of Yahweh but also on the side of men</text>

  <text start="36.11" dur="6.46">although he doesn&amp;#39;t try to make it a</text>
  <text start="39.27" dur="5.07">requirement he says look you know me I</text>
  <text start="42.57" dur="4.38">me and the other apostles we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="44.34" dur="4.26">pouring our lives out for you and so is</text>
  <text start="46.95" dur="3.48">it so hard for you to just give us some</text>
  <text start="48.6" dur="4.17">money you know so that we can survive</text>

  <text start="54.539" dur="5.311">he&amp;#39;d make deletes or tents but but he</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="3.75">did in like second Corinthians chapter</text>
  <text start="59.85" dur="4.62">at you makes this point to the to the</text>
  <text start="62.01" dur="4.92">congregation that he says look you know</text>
  <text start="64.47" dur="3.689">if you&amp;#39;re really appreciative of what</text>
  <text start="66.93" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re doing and what we&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="68.159" dur="4.051">you should give to us and give money to</text>
  <text start="71.1" dur="3.629">us that we can take to the other</text>
  <text start="72.21" dur="6.479">congregations who are in need and so he</text>
  <text start="74.729" dur="5.971">makes his point now I I never charge any</text>
  <text start="78.689" dur="3.54">money for my teachings I never charge</text>
  <text start="80.7" dur="3.38">any money for my videos or anything i</text>
  <text start="82.229" dur="4.381">think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s wickedness any</text>
  <text start="84.08" dur="5.859">messianic or christian ministry that</text>
  <text start="86.61" dur="5.04">charges money for their teachings for</text>
  <text start="89.939" dur="4.11">their videos whatever it&amp;#39;s wrong it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="91.65" dur="4.74">wicked because that doesn&amp;#39;t happen paul</text>
  <text start="94.049" dur="3.78">does make an appeal to the Corinthians</text>
  <text start="96.39" dur="3.51">he says look I&amp;#39;ve been pouring myself</text>
  <text start="97.829" dur="4.711">out for you so the least you can do is</text>
  <text start="99.9" dur="4.829">help me out with my basic needs but but</text>
