  <text start="13.559" dur="6.661">final high Sabbath closing out this</text>
  <text start="16.92" dur="5.31">joyous season of Passover my name is</text>
  <text start="20.22" dur="4.43">Daniel John Lee and this is tour</text>
  <text start="22.23" dur="7.59">restoration ministries the website is</text>
  <text start="24.65" dur="6.639">WWN Torah calm and for today on the</text>
  <text start="29.82" dur="4.2">seventh day of unleavened bread I have a</text>
  <text start="31.289" dur="4.95">very special message that I want to give</text>
  <text start="34.02" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s short and simple but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="36.239" dur="4.441">special because it&amp;#39;s something that I</text>
  <text start="38.64" dur="7.079">had never seen before in the scriptures</text>
  <text start="40.68" dur="7.83">but it&amp;#39;s very very relevant to Passover</text>
  <text start="45.719" dur="6.031">and relevant to the future as you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="48.51" dur="6.779">about to see if you remember the story</text>
  <text start="51.75" dur="7.02">in 2nd Samuel chapter 15 now this is</text>
  <text start="55.289" dur="5.7">when King David he is an older man he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="58.77" dur="4.92">been ruling over Israel for quite a</text>
  <text start="60.989" dur="6.571">number of years and his son Absalom</text>
  <text start="63.69" dur="6.42">decides to stage rebellion and even</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="4.83">recruits one of David&amp;#39;s most trusted</text>
  <text start="70.11" dur="4.5">advisors in fact he&amp;#39;s known as the</text>
  <text start="72.39" dur="5.13">wisest person in the land a HIPPA fell</text>
  <text start="74.61" dur="6.27">and HIPAA fell is an extremely wise</text>
  <text start="77.52" dur="6">counselor and Absalon is basically</text>
  <text start="80.88" dur="4.08">staging a coup he&amp;#39;s taking the hint ship</text>
  <text start="83.52" dur="4.65">away from David he&amp;#39;s declaring himself</text>
  <text start="84.96" dur="6.869">king and so in 2nd Samuel 15 we read</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="6.39">about how David takes his household he</text>
  <text start="91.829" dur="4.29">leaves 10 concubines behind at his</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="2.849">palace to take care of the home but he</text>
  <text start="96.119" dur="3.991">takes the rest of his family and his</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="4.081">household and he flees he gets out of</text>
  <text start="100.11" dur="3.93">Jerusalem because he doesn&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="5.58">gonna happen there&amp;#39;s something very very</text>
  <text start="104.04" dur="6.75">interesting though that occurs as David</text>
  <text start="107.07" dur="6.119">is leaving with his family and that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="110.79" dur="6.149">2nd samuel chapter 15 and starting in</text>
  <text start="113.189" dur="6.241">verse 30 says and David went up by the</text>
  <text start="116.939" dur="4.801">ascent of Mount Olivet so we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="119.43" dur="4.89">about the mount mount Olive&amp;#39;s and he</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="5.4">wept as he went up and had his head</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="4.95">covered and he went barefoot and all the</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="4.41">people that with that was were with him</text>
  <text start="129.27" dur="3.67">covered every man his head and they went</text>
  <text start="131.55" dur="5.95">up weeping</text>
  <text start="132.94" dur="5.82">as they went up so David is ascending</text>
  <text start="137.5" dur="4.02">the Mount of Olives and he&amp;#39;s weeping</text>
  <text start="138.76" dur="6.6">he&amp;#39;s crying his his family is crying</text>
  <text start="141.52" dur="6.36">with him he&amp;#39;s in great defeat now this</text>
  <text start="145.36" dur="4.2">is the very same mountain the skull</text>
  <text start="147.88" dur="4.59">mountain actually Mount of Olives that</text>
  <text start="149.56" dur="6.48">Yahshua ascended when he was being led</text>
  <text start="152.47" dur="5.97">to be crucified and so the fact that</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="5.19">David was going up this mountain the</text>
  <text start="158.44" dur="5.19">Mount of Olives in great weeping and</text>
  <text start="161.23" dur="5.19">great tears and great grief even as</text>
  <text start="163.63" dur="5.73">Yahshua did many many many years later</text>
  <text start="166.42" dur="7.98">when he bore that cross on Passover I</text>
  <text start="169.36" dur="7.14">think is extremely significant and then</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="2.49">it says in verse 31 and one told David</text>
  <text start="176.5" dur="3.2">saying</text>
  <text start="176.89" dur="5.28">m√∂hippa v al try to pronounce that name</text>
  <text start="179.7" dur="6.49">the hipa fell is among the conspirators</text>
  <text start="182.17" dur="6.93">with Absalom and David said o Yahweh I</text>
  <text start="186.19" dur="6.63">pray you turn the counsel of a if L into</text>
  <text start="189.1" dur="5.52">foolishness because he knows that if</text>
  <text start="192.82" dur="4.29">this very very wise counselor helps</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="6.66">Absalon it&amp;#39;s over for David David&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="197.11" dur="6.18">going to be able to to overcome that and</text>
  <text start="201.28" dur="4.65">it came to pass that when David was come</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="5.63">to the top of Mount Olive so now he&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="7.32">the very very top of this mountain and</text>
  <text start="208.92" dur="6.67">there he worshiped Yahweh and behold who</text>
  <text start="213.25" dur="6.05">Shai the arcade came to meet him with</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="6.78">his coat rent and earth upon his head</text>
  <text start="219.3" dur="4.8">unto whom David said if you pass on with</text>
  <text start="222.37" dur="5.82">me then you shall be a burden unto me</text>
  <text start="224.1" dur="6.4">but if you return to the city and Santa</text>
  <text start="228.19" dur="4.59">Absalon I will be your servant O king as</text>
  <text start="230.5" dur="5.16">I have been your father servant from</text>
  <text start="232.78" dur="7.23">this point until now so will I now also</text>
  <text start="235.66" dur="8.68">be your servant then may you for me</text>
  <text start="240.01" dur="7.58">defeat the counsel of a hipa fell</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="6.43">so at the very top of this Mount of</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="5.16">Olives David runs into who shine and if</text>
  <text start="250.77" dur="4.47">you continue reading in second Samuel 16</text>
  <text start="252.75" dur="4.739">and 17 you&amp;#39;ll find out but that is</text>
  <text start="255.24" dur="5.249">exactly what happens who Shai goes back</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="5.011">and even though a HIPPA fel gives</text>
  <text start="260.489" dur="5.581">Absalon really really good advice advice</text>
  <text start="262.5" dur="5.58">that would totally destroy David Absalom</text>
  <text start="266.07" dur="4.41">decides to reject that advice and go</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="4.95">with who shai&amp;#39;s advice instead and that</text>
  <text start="270.48" dur="5.64">winds up allowing David to survive and</text>
  <text start="273.03" dur="7.139">defeats Absalom eventually so David</text>
  <text start="276.12" dur="7.89">basically secures his victory at the top</text>
  <text start="280.169" dur="5.461">of mount Olive&amp;#39;s well that&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="284.01" dur="4.29">foreshadow because if you read in</text>
  <text start="285.63" dur="4.92">Zechariah 14 in the very first few</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="5.16">verses of that chapter we talked about</text>
  <text start="290.55" dur="5.94">Yahshua returning again and where are</text>
  <text start="293.46" dur="6.3">his feet going to land on the very very</text>
  <text start="296.49" dur="5.16">top of mount Olive&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.76" dur="3.84">going to get the ultimate victory when</text>
  <text start="301.65" dur="3.78">he returns with his bride he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="303.6" dur="3.66">return on the top of mount Olive&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="305.43" dur="4.23">we read in the scriptures that the</text>
  <text start="307.26" dur="8.82">mountain is gonna cleave to the east and</text>
  <text start="309.66" dur="8.43">to the west so just as King David found</text>
  <text start="316.08" dur="3.51">his victory the seeds of his victory</text>
  <text start="318.09" dur="4.8">right there on the top of mount Olive&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="5.43">so Yahshua when he returns and begins</text>
  <text start="322.89" dur="5.46">his 1,000 year reign it will be at the</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="5.73">top of mount Olive&amp;#39;s I thought this was</text>
  <text start="328.35" dur="5.189">appropriate to share on the seventh day</text>
  <text start="330.75" dur="5.49">of unleavened bread because you know</text>
  <text start="333.539" dur="5.161">Passover and unleavened bread and first</text>
  <text start="336.24" dur="4.29">fruits we&amp;#39;re always looking back toward</text>
  <text start="338.7" dur="4.32">what Yahshua did and that&amp;#39;s very good I</text>
  <text start="340.53" dur="5.28">mean this whole feast is a memorial of</text>
  <text start="343.02" dur="4.62">what Yahshua did for us but I think this</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="4.169">is neat because this points forward</text>
  <text start="347.64" dur="4.74">points forward to what Yahshua will do</text>
  <text start="349.979" dur="4.741">when he returns in victory on the top of</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="4.95">Mount olives so I hope this was a</text>
  <text start="354.72" dur="4.949">blessing for you I&amp;#39;m enjoying this</text>
  <text start="357.33" dur="4.08">beautiful beautiful day on the seventh</text>
  <text start="359.669" dur="4.111">day of unleavened bread I hope you do as</text>
  <text start="361.41" dur="5.069">well now you have a wonderful rest of</text>
  <text start="363.78" dur="5.66">your season of Passover yah bless and</text>
  <text start="366.479" dur="2.961">shabbat shalom</text>
