  <text start="73.31" dur="4.92">and I think that&amp;#39;s because mark Taylor&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="109.7" dur="4.529">of you may know that if you look at the</text>
  <text start="112.52" dur="3.93">Gospels particularly Gospel of John</text>
  <text start="114.229" dur="5.041">which goes into a lot of this but if you</text>
  <text start="116.45" dur="4.65">combine the four Gospels together you</text>
  <text start="119.27" dur="4.47">can get a really good timeline of the</text>
  <text start="121.1" dur="10.25">final week of Yahshua&amp;#39;s life and what I</text>
  <text start="123.74" dur="7.61">mean by that is so that&amp;#39;s Friday</text>
  <text start="132.05" dur="8.36">of the last week of Yahshua&amp;#39;s life was</text>
  <text start="134.51" dur="10.62">Lazarus was raised from the dead and</text>
  <text start="140.41" dur="6.4">this was when Yahshua raised call called</text>
  <text start="145.13" dur="3.6">Lazarus out he&amp;#39;d been in the grade for</text>
  <text start="146.81" dur="3.75">four days and he called Lazarus up and</text>
  <text start="148.73" dur="3.72">caused a tremendous amount of Jews</text>
  <text start="150.56" dur="4.44">especially in Judea in around today and</text>
  <text start="152.45" dur="5.4">Jerusalem using and Bethel at this point</text>
  <text start="155" dur="4.77">just outside of Jerusalem and caused a</text>
  <text start="157.85" dur="4.5">tremendous amount of Jews to to believe</text>
  <text start="159.77" dur="5.01">on Yahshua and the Pharisees and</text>
  <text start="162.35" dur="4.62">Sadducees the leadership who were very</text>
  <text start="164.78" dur="4.35">corrupt and in conjunction with the</text>
  <text start="166.97" dur="3.9">Romans they were very worried because</text>
  <text start="169.13" dur="3.96">they they realized that they were gonna</text>
  <text start="170.87" dur="4.08">lose all of their power and prestige if</text>
  <text start="173.09" dur="4.95">everyone began to follow after Jesus</text>
  <text start="174.95" dur="4.68">Yahshua is the legitimate Messiah when</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="3.51">he raised Lazarus from the dead after</text>
  <text start="179.63" dur="5.4">being dead for four days it was really</text>
  <text start="181.55" dur="5.61">it shockwaves throughout Israel and so</text>
  <text start="185.03" dur="4.25">that happened on that Friday and then</text>
  <text start="187.16" dur="4.14">the next day Saturday which was Shabbat</text>
  <text start="189.28" dur="2.86">Shabbat is from Friday night to Saturday</text>
  <text start="191.3" dur="3">night</text>
  <text start="192.14" dur="4.2">this was actually palms Shabbat that we</text>
  <text start="194.3" dur="3.87">hear in modern Christianity about Palm</text>
  <text start="196.34" dur="5.869">Sunday was actually Palm Shabbat was a</text>
  <text start="198.17" dur="7.2">Sabbath and this is where Yahshua Jesus</text>
  <text start="202.209" dur="6.881">rides in on the donkey into Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="205.37" dur="5.58">and it&amp;#39;s a triumphal entry it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="3.36">triumphal entry that he comes in and</text>
  <text start="210.95" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re waving the palm lanes shouting</text>
  <text start="212.45" dur="4.95">Hosanna Hosanna to the king and of</text>
  <text start="215.87" dur="3.69">course he also goes into the temple it</text>
  <text start="217.4" dur="4.98">returns two tables but he you know all</text>
  <text start="219.56" dur="5.52">of Jerusalem is cheering him as the</text>
  <text start="222.38" dur="4.92">Messiah and the Pharisees and Sadducees</text>
  <text start="225.08" dur="5.1">are saying how could you allow this to</text>
  <text start="227.3" dur="5.04">happen and and Jesus says if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="230.18" dur="5.04">praise me the rocks will shout out and</text>
  <text start="232.34" dur="5.85">do it so that was the triumphal entry at</text>
  <text start="235.22" dur="6.69">Palm Shabbat and then on Sunday the next</text>
  <text start="238.19" dur="6.06">day Yahshua is going outside of</text>
  <text start="241.91" dur="6.299">Jerusalem again with his disciples and</text>
  <text start="244.25" dur="8.61">he sees a fig tree with fig leaves on it</text>
  <text start="248.209" dur="6.241">and he talks about how it&amp;#39;s a parable of</text>
  <text start="252.86" dur="4.41">the the ripening of the time and it</text>
  <text start="254.45" dur="4.409">begins to go into the end times but he</text>
  <text start="257.27" dur="4.98">sees this beautiful fig tree with leaves</text>
  <text start="258.859" dur="5.281">on that Sunday and then that Monday</text>
  <text start="262.25" dur="4.86">as they return back into Jerusalem they</text>
  <text start="264.14" dur="4.41">pass the same fig tree and Yahshua sees</text>
  <text start="267.11" dur="3.15">that the fig tree though it has leaves</text>
  <text start="268.55" dur="3.3">it doesn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s not bearing any fruit it</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="3.78">should be bearing fruit at the time of</text>
  <text start="271.85" dur="5.6">the years in the spring and it&amp;#39;s not so</text>
  <text start="274.04" dur="7.59">he curses the fig tree on that Monday</text>
  <text start="277.45" dur="7.57">curses the fig tree okay and then that</text>
  <text start="281.63" dur="5.34">Tuesday this is when they&amp;#39;re making the</text>
  <text start="285.02" dur="3.69">preparations for the Passover the</text>
  <text start="286.97" dur="4.23">disciples are going in trying to prepare</text>
  <text start="288.71" dur="5.49">the upper room and then that Tuesday</text>
  <text start="291.2" dur="5.19">night of course is the Last Supper as is</text>
  <text start="294.2" dur="5.04">known it&amp;#39;s the beginning of Passover the</text>
  <text start="296.39" dur="4.71">beginning of the 14th day of Aviv this</text>
  <text start="299.24" dur="5.76">is of course when Judas then betrays</text>
  <text start="301.1" dur="6.54">Jesus that night and then into that</text>
  <text start="305" dur="4.29">night Jesus is arrested all the way</text>
  <text start="307.64" dur="4.83">through midnight into Wednesday morning</text>
  <text start="309.29" dur="5.67">he&amp;#39;s scourged whipped and of course that</text>
  <text start="312.47" dur="6.18">Wednesday is Passover and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="314.96" dur="6.99">Jesus is crucified he&amp;#39;s crucified on</text>
  <text start="318.65" dur="4.74">that Wednesday and then remember he says</text>
  <text start="321.95" dur="3.33">he&amp;#39;s going to be in the grave three days</text>
  <text start="323.39" dur="3.45">and three nights right so Wednesday</text>
  <text start="325.28" dur="3.72">night Thursday night Friday night and</text>
  <text start="326.84" dur="5.639">then all day Thursday all day Friday all</text>
  <text start="329" dur="4.86">day Saturday so Saturday evening as the</text>
  <text start="332.479" dur="3.121">Sun is setting it&amp;#39;s the Shabbat is</text>
  <text start="333.86" dur="4.17">ending he rises from the grave and then</text>
  <text start="335.6" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s that early Sunday morning where</text>
  <text start="338.03" dur="3.69">they discovered that he&amp;#39;s been risen all</text>
  <text start="340.1" dur="3.84">right so three days and three nights</text>
  <text start="341.72" dur="4.62">he&amp;#39;s in the grave Thursday Friday</text>
  <text start="343.94" dur="5.91">Saturday and then that Sunday they</text>
  <text start="346.34" dur="6.24">discover that he is risen and that was</text>
  <text start="349.85" dur="6.21">of course the feast of firstfruits that</text>
  <text start="352.58" dur="6.48">year so that&amp;#39;s the basic timeline now</text>
  <text start="356.06" dur="9.99">the teaching that I had had was that</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="9.99">Friday was 2019 the 2019 would be marked</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="5.55">as a year of Lazarus being raised from</text>
  <text start="369.05" dur="5.73">the dead and we&amp;#39;ve truly seen that with</text>
  <text start="371.6" dur="4.77">the triumphant victories of Epstein</text>
  <text start="374.78" dur="3.66">being arrested we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="376.37" dur="5.04">beginning stages now the satanic Cabal</text>
  <text start="378.44" dur="5.15">being torn down the satanic Luciferian</text>
  <text start="381.41" dur="6.03">pedophiles being arrested and exposed</text>
  <text start="383.59" dur="4.99">we&amp;#39;re seeing people awaken like never</text>
  <text start="387.44" dur="3.21">before</text>
  <text start="388.58" dur="5.04">this is the year Lazarus being raised</text>
  <text start="390.65" dur="5.46">from the dead I know my ministry is</text>
  <text start="393.62" dur="4.83">being blessed tremendously I was</text>
  <text start="396.11" dur="4.02">thinking of just a year ago when John</text>
  <text start="398.45" dur="4.5">and I first started my prayer meeting</text>
  <text start="400.13" dur="5.31">you know I had about 8,000 subscribers I</text>
  <text start="402.95" dur="4.83">had all these enemies and trolls and now</text>
  <text start="405.44" dur="3.12">almost a year later I have 81 thousand</text>
  <text start="407.78" dur="3.18">subscribers</text>
  <text start="408.56" dur="6.27">most of my trolls and enemies are gone</text>
  <text start="410.96" dur="5.67">like what Psalm 37 says behold you look</text>
  <text start="414.83" dur="3.75">for the sinner and the wicked man and he</text>
  <text start="416.63" dur="3.42">is no more and just all these blessings</text>
  <text start="418.58" dur="3.06">and tremendous blessings and I know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="420.05" dur="3.96">not just for my ministries for many and</text>
  <text start="421.64" dur="3.99">he&amp;#39;s connecting his people together so</text>
  <text start="424.01" dur="3.93">truly I believe this is the year of</text>
  <text start="425.63" dur="6.71">Lazarus being raised from the dead</text>
  <text start="427.94" dur="7.17">that&amp;#39;s what marks 2019 now in 2020</text>
  <text start="432.34" dur="5.35">that&amp;#39;s the Palm Sabbath the triumphal</text>
  <text start="435.11" dur="5.07">entry of Yahshua coming on the donkey</text>
  <text start="437.69" dur="5.28">and 2020 is when President Trump will be</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="4.38">reelected he&amp;#39;ll be reelected because a</text>
  <text start="442.97" dur="3.45">lot of America will be awake and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="444.56" dur="3.71">see all the stuff he&amp;#39;s doing and of</text>
  <text start="446.42" dur="6.05">course his reelection will herald the</text>
  <text start="448.27" dur="6.97">the end of this old satanic cabal of the</text>
  <text start="452.47" dur="4.51">Satanic pedophiles being totally exposed</text>
  <text start="455.24" dur="5.16">and brought down arrested</text>
  <text start="456.98" dur="8.28">it&amp;#39;ll be truly a triumphal MV in 2020</text>
  <text start="460.4" dur="9.78">when Trump Trump is re-elected and then</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="6.84">we go to Sunday which is 2021 and we see</text>
  <text start="470.18" dur="3.9">Ostra seeing the fig tree with believes</text>
  <text start="472.1" dur="5.25">and talking about the end times and this</text>
  <text start="474.08" dur="6.9">is when the Temple in Jerusalem would be</text>
  <text start="477.35" dur="5.82">fully rebuilt and I talked about this in</text>
  <text start="480.98" dur="4.89">the annual eight it talks about the 2300</text>
  <text start="483.17" dur="5.51">days and the 2300 days would actually</text>
  <text start="485.87" dur="5.31">start on June 14th that&amp;#39;s the day after</text>
  <text start="488.68" dur="4.51">Pentecost or shadow if that year also</text>
  <text start="491.18" dur="3.87">happens to be president Trump&amp;#39;s birthday</text>
  <text start="493.19" dur="3.6">but the temple would be fully rebuilt</text>
  <text start="495.05" dur="3.75">the sacrifices would be in place and</text>
  <text start="496.79" dur="6.32">that would kick off the final 2300 days</text>
  <text start="498.8" dur="7.56">that will culminate on yom teruah 2027</text>
  <text start="503.11" dur="5.26">and so the temple is rebuilt and Israel</text>
  <text start="506.36" dur="4.08">is you know this you know major</text>
  <text start="508.37" dur="4.35">superpower it&amp;#39;s just incredible what&amp;#39;s</text>
