  <text start="0.06" dur="5.37">they make outfits out of this which were</text>
  <text start="2.55" dur="5.91">those big long kind superior looking</text>
  <text start="5.43" dur="4.709">ones they made shields you know killed</text>
  <text start="8.46" dur="4.589">you defend yourself with a sword fights</text>
  <text start="10.139" dur="3.481">some of those had gun poking through the</text>
  <text start="13.049" dur="2.55">shield</text>
  <text start="13.62" dur="22.619">so they made all kinds of combination</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="22.431">leathers these were not combat coming</text>
  <text start="36.239" dur="5.521">back to be stuff that&amp;#39;s kind of the road</text>
  <text start="38.03" dur="6.72">that we had to take to get to these</text>
  <text start="41.76" dur="6.24">belts and there were a lot of other</text>
  <text start="44.75" dur="5.41">variations of those guys but I hope it</text>
  <text start="48" dur="3.989">hits kind of the highlights of gun</text>
  <text start="50.16" dur="3.39">development over the centuries does</text>
  <text start="51.989" dur="4.011">anybody have any questions about</text>
  <text start="53.55" dur="2.45">anything</text>
  <text start="57.32" dur="9.1">some of these are Michael I got them</text>
  <text start="63.96" dur="4.71">online and some of them are old Sowerby</text>
  <text start="66.42" dur="3.83">for documents one of the interesting</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="4.11">things all of these are reproductions</text>
  <text start="70.25" dur="6.729">they there are companies that make</text>
  <text start="72.78" dur="5.28">reproductions of you know period pretty</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="6.771">much any period</text>
  <text start="78.06" dur="8.22">I assume takes a while to reload these</text>
  <text start="83.75" dur="7.72">wrinkles battle you get one shot and</text>
  <text start="86.28" dur="7.199">then you in the hand or no no by the</text>
  <text start="91.47" dur="3.539">time of American Revolutionary War</text>
  <text start="93.479" dur="5.221">Ashley beginning in the early sixteen</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="6.511">hundreds introduction of cartridge you</text>
  <text start="98.7" dur="6">know the paper cartridge we can load</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="4.98">muzzle loaders at 50 seconds oh yeah so</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="4.709">that that&amp;#39;s pretty quick you get this</text>
  <text start="106.5" dur="5.909">but these funds can be shot four times a</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="5.64">minute and maybe even faster a lot of</text>
  <text start="112.409" dur="5.611">times on a battlefield especially if you</text>
  <text start="115.049" dur="5.881">need to fire quicker you can do that</text>
  <text start="118.02" dur="6.059">without necessarily ramming because we</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="5.25">do sucking up out pretty small ball yeah</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="3.241">bro there&amp;#39;s an undersized ball so</text>
  <text start="126.18" dur="3.39">sometimes it would just</text>
  <text start="127.32" dur="4.02">senator going through the process of</text>
  <text start="129.57" dur="3.51">cramming that&amp;#39;s not safe by the way</text>
  <text start="131.34" dur="3.03">because if the ball isn&amp;#39;t all the way at</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="3.8">the bottom you can blow the barrel up</text>
  <text start="134.37" dur="4.95">but again you make those choices without</text>
  <text start="136.88" dur="4.66">you know take my chances because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="139.32" dur="5.25">almost on the movies I think the</text>
  <text start="141.54" dur="5.94">Revolution where you you saw three lines</text>
  <text start="144.57" dur="5.7">once well and then second line so then</text>
  <text start="147.48" dur="5.19">they would come back lower so you can</text>
  <text start="150.27" dur="4.56">always have read Brown that the</text>
  <text start="152.67" dur="7.11">techniques you know yeah that that was</text>
  <text start="154.83" dur="7.92">you but once again every balance given</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="5.52">and the number of ranks they had</text>
  <text start="162.75" dur="5.04">depended on the speed at which they</text>
  <text start="165.3" dur="4.38">would reload yeah so when you look at</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="3.6">the first musket</text>
  <text start="169.68" dur="9.27">when that first musket comes out in the</text>
  <text start="171.39" dur="11.19">early 15 timers the ranks were 10 B okay</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="5.28">so by the way those early muskets that</text>
  <text start="182.58" dur="3.6">one is not an example of it that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="184.23" dur="4.74">little bit later musket but early was we</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="4.8">could be up to 25 pounds that one&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="188.97" dur="3.87">added about 16 pounds on there so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="3.96">not as big as the ones that were at</text>
  <text start="192.84" dur="4.02">Paige the problem was it took so long to</text>
  <text start="194.94" dur="5.07">load so what they would do front rank</text>
  <text start="196.86" dur="5.84">was fire and then you have space because</text>
  <text start="200.01" dur="5.46">then they would countermarch that back</text>
  <text start="202.7" dur="4.66">to the background and while they were</text>
  <text start="205.47" dur="3.96">back there moving up they&amp;#39;d be loading</text>
  <text start="207.36" dur="3.719">their gun so hopefully by the time they</text>
  <text start="209.43" dur="3.72">got back up to the front of the line</text>
  <text start="211.079" dur="3.391">they were ready to fire again so what</text>
  <text start="213.15" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;re doing now is you&amp;#39;re getting let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.47" dur="2.85">say you have a hundred men tend to be</text>
  <text start="216.72" dur="2.31">trying</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="3.449">so the first ranks minor defend guns</text>
  <text start="219.03" dur="4.32">then you were back in the next row</text>
  <text start="220.769" dur="4.771">expiring ten guns but as they shorten</text>
  <text start="223.35" dur="5.07">the loading time shortened amount of</text>
  <text start="225.54" dur="5.009">rise first I think Alan says you know</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="3.86">now we now we got more guns in the front</text>
  <text start="230.549" dur="3.441">behind the same number meant more</text>
  <text start="232.28" dur="3.96">gun to the front right so we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="233.99" dur="4.53">more firepower and then has to be</text>
  <text start="236.24" dur="3.81">speeded that up even more Costello&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.52" dur="4.23">office actually introduced paper</text>
  <text start="240.05" dur="4.35">cartridge in Europe the Swedish came in</text>
  <text start="242.75" dur="3.75">the early sixteen hundreds he got it</text>
  <text start="244.4" dur="4.68">down to where he was using three rags</text>
  <text start="246.5" dur="4.41">and they could fire all three ranks at</text>
  <text start="249.08" dur="3.6">once they didn&amp;#39;t usually usually the</text>
  <text start="250.91" dur="4.5">first two rates were fired the third</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="4.26">rank was a reserved rank so as men fell</text>
  <text start="255.41" dur="4.109">in the first few ranks the Third Reich</text>
  <text start="256.94" dur="5.82">will come up and join them but you could</text>
  <text start="259.519" dur="5.851">fire by rank you could have that person</text>
  <text start="262.76" dur="6.51">a fire and they moved the second rank up</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="5.46">to fire you can also fire by company so</text>
  <text start="269.27" dur="3.69">one company and then the next company</text>
  <text start="270.83" dur="4.83">the whole problem of having the entire</text>
  <text start="272.96" dur="4.77">regiment fire wants of course is</text>
  <text start="275.66" dur="4.44">everybody in the regiment as an empty</text>
  <text start="277.73" dur="4.17">gun is the same doctor so if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="280.1" dur="3.24">want that to happen you need to come up</text>
  <text start="281.9" dur="3.21">with up and they have all kinds</text>
  <text start="283.34" dur="3.69">sometimes they would even fire and I</text>
  <text start="285.11" dur="4.59">have liked to watch this if you see a</text>
  <text start="287.03" dur="5.1">long line of men firing by file let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.7" dur="4.38">say you have three lines the first fire</text>
  <text start="292.13" dur="4.59">that fir&amp;#39;d the first guy on the end</text>
  <text start="294.08" dur="4.71">fires that the second guy that the third</text>
  <text start="296.72" dur="5.19">guy that the word penalty in east rank</text>
  <text start="298.79" dur="5.79">vote yeah so she was like a rolling fire</text>
  <text start="301.91" dur="4.35">right down the line and then you go back</text>
  <text start="304.58" dur="4.23">to the start again in other words you</text>
  <text start="306.26" dur="7.23">just keep that moving along but again</text>
  <text start="308.81" dur="6.33">you&amp;#39;re firing fewer guns that they give</text>
  <text start="313.49" dur="7.61">you the best story on a hill up of</text>
  <text start="315.14" dur="5.96">massive volley fire the battle was the</text>
  <text start="323.9" dur="8.64">it was the Battle of I&amp;#39;m sorry but it</text>
  <text start="328.97" dur="8.37">was fought between the nebulas final</text>
  <text start="332.54" dur="6.6">canto 1415 Tigers the British Army</text>
  <text start="337.34" dur="3.12">fighting the French army now coming to</text>
  <text start="339.14" dur="5.7">preface this a little bit</text>
  <text start="340.46" dur="6.75">the French army had been accused by many</text>
  <text start="344.84" dur="4.26">other armies in Europe being cowards</text>
  <text start="347.21" dur="4.35">because of some battle a year before</text>
  <text start="349.1" dur="4.11">they had fired early they they had fired</text>
  <text start="351.56" dur="3.45">beyond the range of the weapons there</text>
  <text start="353.21" dur="3.87">that was French or cowards they fire</text>
  <text start="355.01" dur="4.56">their guns too early so the French army</text>
  <text start="357.08" dur="5.22">was trying to live down that reputation</text>
  <text start="359.57" dur="7.62">so at the Battle of on the way they had</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="6.57">a they had a for French regiments in the</text>
  <text start="367.19" dur="4.02">center of the battlefield they were</text>
  <text start="368.87" dur="3.93">anchored on one side by the village and</text>
  <text start="371.21" dur="5.22">on the other side by a heavily wooded</text>
  <text start="372.8" dur="5.55">area they did not think they were going</text>
  <text start="376.43" dur="4.11">to be attacked Center regiments because</text>
  <text start="378.35" dur="5.22">in front of them was a hill and over the</text>
  <text start="380.54" dur="5.16">hill was a big swamp area and most of</text>
  <text start="383.57" dur="4.38">the French armies were at the twof lines</text>
  <text start="385.7" dur="3.81">okay with their big guns and any</text>
  <text start="387.95" dur="4.35">Englishman trying to come through that</text>
  <text start="389.51" dur="4.95">Center swamp would be under fire for</text>
  <text start="392.3" dur="3.36">both climbs so they didn&amp;#39;t figure the</text>
  <text start="394.46" dur="2.67">English is going to do that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.66" dur="4.26">pretty stupid you&amp;#39;re gonna lose a lot of</text>
  <text start="397.13" dur="5.31">men the main fighting was going to be on</text>
  <text start="399.92" dur="5.43">the flanks by the way it was but midday</text>
  <text start="402.44" dur="5.13">the French line sees a couple British</text>
  <text start="405.35" dur="4.41">soldiers on the hill somebody&amp;#39;s come</text>
  <text start="407.57" dur="4.14">through the swamp and before they know</text>
  <text start="409.76" dur="4.29">it there&amp;#39;s five British regiments up</text>
  <text start="411.71" dur="3.84">there by British regiments have reported</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="3.06">their way through the smell they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="415.55" dur="4.05">taken a lot of casualties we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="417.11" dur="5.04">how many is left but when they form</text>
  <text start="419.6" dur="4.85">their mind they were 80 yards from the</text>
  <text start="422.15" dur="4.38">French army and the French</text>
  <text start="424.45" dur="4.12">theoretically defense takes the first</text>
  <text start="426.53" dur="3.39">shot but the French army just stood</text>
  <text start="428.57" dur="4.11">there didn&amp;#39;t move a muscle and the</text>
  <text start="429.92" dur="5.61">English commander why aren&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="432.68" dur="5.25">shooting 480 yards from them so he says</text>
  <text start="435.53" dur="5.04">ok well he begins marching down the hill</text>
  <text start="437.93" dur="4.53">because there are rules of warfare it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.57" dur="5">not everybody follows but he started</text>
  <text start="442.46" dur="5.42">moving down the hill thinking well yeah</text>
  <text start="445.57" dur="3.84">he keeps coming and he keeps coming in</text>
  <text start="447.88" dur="3.72">French it&amp;#39;s not responding they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="449.41" dur="4.23">responding at all so finding the</text>
  <text start="451.6" dur="5.37">commander stops his English slides at</text>
  <text start="453.64" dur="6.45">30th 30 yards in terms of French line 30</text>
  <text start="456.97" dur="4.44">yards and the armies are looking each</text>
  <text start="460.09" dur="3.09">other now this part of the story may not</text>
  <text start="461.41" dur="7.92">be true but I think it&amp;#39;s a gorgeous</text>
  <text start="463.18" dur="8.91">crown supposedly at this time the</text>
  <text start="469.33" dur="5.64">English commander guy named Paul decides</text>
  <text start="472.09" dur="5.07">to ride forward ahead of his line and he</text>
  <text start="474.97" dur="4.89">yells over the French commander says sir</text>
  <text start="477.16" dur="4.14">I believe that is your shot and the</text>
  <text start="479.86" dur="4.23">present man her supposed to have shot</text>
  <text start="481.3" dur="3.39">his back no sir gentlemen do not fire</text>
  <text start="484.09" dur="3.51">first</text>
  <text start="484.69" dur="5.34">so the Englishman came a you know what a</text>
  <text start="487.6" dur="4.38">fighter we will so he&amp;#39;d go back he goes</text>
  <text start="490.03" dur="4.32">back and he orders his line to load and</text>
  <text start="491.98" dur="5.76">make ready they would make ready and</text>
  <text start="494.35" dur="6.3">give fire at that moment probably</text>
  <text start="497.74" dur="6.3">somewhere around 2,000 British guns go</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="6.72">off when the smoke clear there were over</text>
  <text start="504.04" dur="5.73">800 Frenchmen on the ground and the rest</text>
  <text start="507.37" dur="4.05">of those French the rest of the 2,000</text>
  <text start="509.77" dur="5.06">French soldiers that were in that line</text>
  <text start="511.42" dur="3.41">retreated you</text>
