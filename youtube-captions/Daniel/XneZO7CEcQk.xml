  <text start="137.069" dur="4.591">a matter of weeks extended in two months</text>
  <text start="138.69" dur="5.7">I finally very grudgingly began to</text>
  <text start="141.66" dur="4.95">cooperate with DHS but as I began to</text>
  <text start="144.39" dur="4.47">jump through the hoops my wife filed for</text>

  <text start="151.92" dur="4.41">cooled her heart toward me and now</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="4.77">divorce was a very real possibility in a</text>

  <text start="192.389" dur="4.081">on an almost weekly basis and took her</text>
  <text start="194.43" dur="3.69">out on dates as often as I could there</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="4.2">was a distance and coldness in her eyes</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="4.019">her attitude communicated to me more</text>
  <text start="200.67" dur="4.8">than a million words that she could</text>
  <text start="202.139" dur="5.94">utter one very clear thing that she had</text>

  <text start="208.079" dur="4.261">later just before DHS completely pulled</text>
  <text start="210.419" dur="4.801">out of our lives but something</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="5.22">unbelievably amazing happened as day</text>
  <text start="215.22" dur="4.47">after day I unselfishly gave to my wife</text>
  <text start="217.56" dur="4.32">trying to win her heart back blaming</text>
  <text start="219.69" dur="5.43">myself for this whole mess a stark</text>

  <text start="260.82" dur="5.099">crown for the very first time in my life</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="5.42">I experienced a small slice of what</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="5.101">Yahshua emotionally bore on that cross I</text>
  <text start="268.82" dur="4.93">bore the condemnation of my wife</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="4.89">rejected blaming myself for her decision</text>
  <text start="273.75" dur="5.19">still choosing to lay my life down and</text>
  <text start="275.91" dur="5.28">give to her after months of enduring</text>

  <text start="283.139" dur="4.681">wave of his spirit it is even now hard</text>
  <text start="285.419" dur="4.56">to describe the terrible pain of</text>
  <text start="287.82" dur="4.95">rejection and condemnation gave way to a</text>
  <text start="289.979" dur="4.681">brilliant gold crown of glory and a</text>
