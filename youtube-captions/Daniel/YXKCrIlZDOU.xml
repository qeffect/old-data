  <text start="18.18" dur="4.65">chapter 56 there&amp;#39;s a very interesting</text>
  <text start="20.31" dur="5.16">prophecy that I want to talk about and</text>
  <text start="22.83" dur="4.529">it all has to do with the Sabbath as you</text>
  <text start="25.47" dur="4.17">know or as you should know the</text>
  <text start="27.359" dur="4.95">seventh-day Sabbath occurs from friday</text>

  <text start="38.76" dur="7.889">rest not to do any work and to spend the</text>
  <text start="41.43" dur="7.379">day with him so let&amp;#39;s read starting in</text>
  <text start="46.649" dur="4.68">verse one in Isaiah chapter fit excuse</text>
  <text start="48.809" dur="5.64">me in Isaiah chapter 56 verse 1 thus</text>
  <text start="51.329" dur="5.07">says Yahweh keepy judgment and do</text>
  <text start="54.449" dur="3.93">justice for my salvation is near to come</text>
  <text start="56.399" dur="4.32">and my righteousness to be revealed</text>
  <text start="58.379" dur="3.93">blessed is that man that do with this</text>
  <text start="60.719" dur="3.69">and the son of man that lay hold on it</text>
  <text start="62.309" dur="5.521">that keeps the Sabbath from polluting it</text>
  <text start="64.409" dur="5.491">and keeps his hand from doing any evil</text>
  <text start="67.83" dur="4.44">so at the very outset of Isaiah 56 we</text>
  <text start="69.9" dur="4.2">see that Yahweh&amp;#39;s saying blessed is the</text>
  <text start="72.27" dur="3.69">man who keeps the Sabbath so anyone</text>
  <text start="74.1" dur="4.409">Christian or otherwise who tries to tell</text>
  <text start="75.96" dur="5.4">you that it is not important to keep the</text>
  <text start="78.509" dur="4.951">seventh-day Sabbath that you can work on</text>
  <text start="81.36" dur="3.899">Saturdays that it&amp;#39;s okay if the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="4.26">was changed to a Sunday they are lying</text>
  <text start="85.259" dur="6.691">to you because that would make this</text>
  <text start="87.72" dur="6.18">verse a lie first three need to let the</text>
  <text start="91.95" dur="3.84">son of the stranger that had joined</text>
  <text start="93.9" dur="3.3">himself to Yahweh speak saying Yahweh</text>
  <text start="95.79" dur="3.149">have utterly separated me from his</text>
  <text start="97.2" dur="3.66">people neither let the eunuchs say</text>
  <text start="98.939" dur="3.54">behold I am a dry tree for thus saith</text>
  <text start="100.86" dur="3.6">Yahweh into the eunuchs that keep my</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="3.811">sabbaths and choose the things that</text>
  <text start="104.46" dur="4.11">please me and take hold of my covenant</text>
  <text start="106.29" dur="4.5">even unto them will I give in mine house</text>
  <text start="108.57" dur="5.189">and within my walls a place and a name</text>
  <text start="110.79" dur="4.38">better than of sons and daughters I will</text>
  <text start="113.759" dur="5.101">give them an everlasting name and she&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="5.79">that shall not be cut off from the sons</text>
  <text start="118.86" dur="4.079">of the stranger that join themselves to</text>
  <text start="120.96" dur="3.93">Yahweh to serve Him and to love the name</text>
  <text start="122.939" dur="3.841">of Yahweh and to be his servants</text>
  <text start="124.89" dur="3.479">everyone that keeps the Sabbath from</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="3.869">polluting it and takes hold of my</text>
  <text start="128.369" dur="4.021">covenant even then will I bring to my</text>
  <text start="130.649" dur="2.271">holy mountain and make them joyful my</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="2.09">house</text>
  <text start="132.92" dur="3.42">err they&amp;#39;re burnt offerings and their</text>
  <text start="134.48" dur="3.479">sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine</text>
  <text start="136.34" dur="5.79">altar for my house shall be called a</text>
  <text start="137.959" dur="8.071">house of prayer for all people so here</text>
  <text start="142.13" dur="7.89">we see that the stranger the eunuch the</text>
  <text start="146.03" dur="7.55">outcast the Gentile is what this these</text>
  <text start="150.02" dur="6">verses are describing the Gentiles who</text>
  <text start="153.58" dur="4.98">those who want to join themselves to</text>
  <text start="156.02" dur="5.549">Yahweh they will be blessed exceedingly</text>
  <text start="158.56" dur="4.84">exceedingly if they hold to the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="161.569" dur="3.781">so they keep the Sabbath and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="163.4" dur="4.95">pollute the Sabbath day and in fact</text>
  <text start="165.35" dur="9.389">Yahweh says that I will give them names</text>
  <text start="168.35" dur="10.32">better better than the names of my of</text>
  <text start="174.739" dur="5.22">being a son and daughter so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="178.67" dur="4.44">going to be elevated into a special</text>
  <text start="179.959" dur="4.831">place so again not only is this chapter</text>
  <text start="183.11" dur="4.68">talking about how wonderful and glorious</text>
  <text start="184.79" dur="4.919">and blessing what a blessing it is to</text>
  <text start="187.79" dur="3.57">keep the Sabbath day but now it&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="189.709" dur="5.041">that the Sabbath day is not just for the</text>
  <text start="191.36" dur="6.09">Hebrews but for the stranger which is a</text>
  <text start="194.75" dur="5.43">word that means Gentile okay for the</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="4.98">non-jew for the non Hebrew the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="200.18" dur="3.96">is important and for those non Hebrews</text>
  <text start="202.43" dur="3.96">who wish to join themselves di way and</text>
  <text start="204.14" dur="4.01">if they take and keep the Sabbath from</text>
  <text start="206.39" dur="4.26">polluting it and take all the Covenant</text>
  <text start="208.15" dur="4.48">they&amp;#39;re going to get a name better than</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="4.02">sons and daughters they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="212.63" dur="4.05">brought to his holy mountain they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.67" dur="4.23">going to be made joyful in his house of</text>
  <text start="216.68" dur="5.91">prayer their sacrifices and offerings</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="6.3">will be accepted upon his altar and they</text>
  <text start="222.59" dur="4.769">will be gathered unto him so this</text>
  <text start="225.2" dur="4.02">Sabbath day the seventh day shabbat</text>
  <text start="227.359" dur="4.891">shalom from friday sundown to Saturday</text>
  <text start="229.22" dur="5.579">sundown is not just for the Jew not for</text>
  <text start="232.25" dur="7.319">just for the Hebrew but for all humanity</text>
  <text start="234.799" dur="6.72">according to Isaiah 56 verse 8 I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="239.569" dur="4.471">know Yahweh which gathers the outcasts</text>
  <text start="241.519" dur="4.621">of israel says yet while I gather others</text>
  <text start="244.04" dur="5.43">to and besides those that are gathered</text>
  <text start="246.14" dur="6.09">unto him okay so this is a prophecy</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="4.919">about how Yahweh is going to reach out</text>
  <text start="252.23" dur="4.65">to the Gentile nations and bring them</text>
  <text start="254.389" dur="4.32">unto him just as he did Israel and of</text>
  <text start="256.88" dur="3.69">course this is what has happened over</text>
  <text start="258.709" dur="6.001">the past two thousand years since</text>
  <text start="260.57" dur="5.91">Yahshua rose again verse 9 all ye beasts</text>
  <text start="264.71" dur="5.04">of the field come to devour</text>
  <text start="266.48" dur="4.32">all ye beasts in the forest now pay</text>
  <text start="269.75" dur="3.06">attention to these next few verses</text>
  <text start="270.8" dur="4.92">because this is the prophecy that I</text>
  <text start="272.81" dur="8.19">believe is so amazingly embedded in</text>
  <text start="275.72" dur="8.55">Isaiah 56 his Watchmen are blind okay so</text>
  <text start="281" dur="6.3">we&amp;#39;re talking now about those who are</text>
  <text start="284.27" dur="6.05">supposed to have the role of being</text>
  <text start="287.3" dur="5.34">Watchmen those who are called to be</text>
  <text start="290.32" dur="4">servants of Yahweh it says they are</text>
  <text start="292.64" dur="4.41">blind they&amp;#39;re all ignorant they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="294.32" dur="5.97">dumb dogs they cannot bark sleeping</text>
  <text start="297.05" dur="4.8">lying down loving the slumber yeah they</text>
  <text start="300.29" dur="3.24">are greedy dogs which can never have</text>
  <text start="301.85" dur="3.6">enough and they are Shepherds that</text>
  <text start="303.53" dur="3.6">cannot understand they all look to their</text>
  <text start="305.45" dur="3.56">own way everyone for his gain from his</text>
  <text start="307.13" dur="4.05">quarter okay so we are talking about</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="3.97">suppose it believers those who are</text>
  <text start="311.18" dur="3.48">supposed to be believe are supposed to</text>
  <text start="312.98" dur="4.86">be Watchmen they&amp;#39;re supposed to be</text>
  <text start="314.66" dur="6.36">shepherds and yet they&amp;#39;re dumb they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="317.84" dur="5.58">sleeping they&amp;#39;re slumbering they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="321.02" dur="5.58">living the way they should live so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.42" dur="9.03">talking about hypocrites and then look</text>
  <text start="326.6" dur="8.7">at verse 12 uh-huh come ye say they I</text>
  <text start="332.45" dur="5.78">will fetch wine and we will fill</text>
  <text start="335.3" dur="5.25">ourselves with strong drink and tomorrow</text>
  <text start="338.23" dur="5.38">she&amp;#39;ll be as this day and much more</text>
  <text start="340.55" dur="5.88">abundant look what it says it says and</text>
  <text start="343.61" dur="5.58">tomorrow she&amp;#39;ll be as this day well what</text>
  <text start="346.43" dur="4.11">day have we been talking about through</text>
  <text start="349.19" dur="3.21">the entire chapter we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="350.54" dur="4.02">about the Sabbath day the seventh day of</text>
  <text start="352.4" dur="4.62">the week we&amp;#39;ve been talking about Friday</text>
  <text start="354.56" dur="6.87">sundown to Saturday sundown and they say</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="7.92">tomorrow she&amp;#39;ll be as this day well what</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="6.42">happened 800 years after this was</text>
  <text start="364.94" dur="5.58">written there was a religion formed</text>
  <text start="367.85" dur="5.16">called Christianity and what happened at</text>
  <text start="370.52" dur="5.72">the Council of Nicaea the Sabbath day</text>
  <text start="373.01" dur="7.26">Saturday was changed to someday to</text>
  <text start="376.24" dur="6.76">tomorrow and so then people started</text>
  <text start="380.27" dur="4.47">saying tomorrow Sunday the day after</text>
  <text start="383" dur="3.39">centered tomorrow shall be as this day</text>
  <text start="384.74" dur="4.02">shall be as the Sabbath we will make</text>
  <text start="386.39" dur="4.74">Sunday as the Sabbath and much more</text>
  <text start="388.76" dur="4.44">abundant so this is a prophecy right</text>
  <text start="391.13" dur="6.12">here in Isaiah 56 verse 12 that</text>
  <text start="393.2" dur="5.85">prophecies apostasy within Christianity</text>
  <text start="397.25" dur="2.61">that transfers the Sabbath day from</text>
  <text start="399.05" dur="3.81">Saturday to</text>
  <text start="399.86" dur="5.399">the tomorrow to the next day to Sunday</text>
  <text start="402.86" dur="4.17">and they say we will say that this</text>
  <text start="405.259" dur="3.241">tomorrow Sunday shall be as this day</text>
  <text start="407.03" dur="2.819">shall be as the Sabbath and much more</text>
  <text start="408.5" dur="3.389">abundant and now of course many</text>
  <text start="409.849" dur="3.78">Christians believe that Sunday the first</text>
  <text start="411.889" dur="4.08">day of the week which is a work day is</text>
  <text start="413.629" dur="4.26">the Sabbath day because it was changed</text>
  <text start="415.969" dur="3.271">why was it changed to others a lot of</text>
  <text start="417.889" dur="5.55">reasons it was changed one of them is</text>
  <text start="419.24" dur="6.57">because the Constantine was trying to</text>
  <text start="423.439" dur="4.561">appeal to the pagan Sun God worshipers</text>
  <text start="425.81" dur="5.159">and sunday was the day that the Sun God</text>
  <text start="428" dur="5.219">was venerated so he he stamped Sunday as</text>
  <text start="430.969" dur="4.591">being the Christian Sabbath to attract</text>
  <text start="433.219" dur="3.931">the pagan Sun God worshippers but we</text>
  <text start="435.56" dur="3.21">never water down the truth in order to</text>
  <text start="437.15" dur="5.129">attract the wicked that&amp;#39;s not how it</text>
  <text start="438.77" dur="5.73">works we Herald the truth we stand for</text>
  <text start="442.279" dur="3.871">the truth the pure truth and pray that</text>
  <text start="444.5" dur="3.689">the pagans and the wicked will turn away</text>
  <text start="446.15" dur="3.21">from their lives and cleave under the</text>
  <text start="448.189" dur="2.88">Covenant and of course that&amp;#39;s what this</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="3.89">whole chapters about it&amp;#39;s about the</text>
  <text start="451.069" dur="4.771">Gentiles the strangers the eunuchs</text>
  <text start="453.25" dur="5.62">cleaving unto yahweh taking hold the</text>
  <text start="455.84" dur="4.74">Sabbath and not polluting it what is the</text>
  <text start="458.87" dur="4.949">ultimate way of polluting the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="460.58" dur="4.679">it&amp;#39;s changing it changing the day now</text>
  <text start="463.819" dur="2.761">you may have heard your Christian</text>
  <text start="465.259" dur="3.06">friends and others saying well it</text>
  <text start="466.58" dur="2.97">doesn&amp;#39;t really matter as long as we keep</text>
  <text start="468.319" dur="4.681">the Sabbath that doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="469.55" dur="5.549">which day we keep it on but that is not</text>
  <text start="473" dur="4.11">true why would you always specify a</text>
  <text start="475.099" dur="4.38">specific day to keep the Sabbath if it</text>
  <text start="477.11" dur="4.679">doesn&amp;#39;t matter and furthermore why would</text>
  <text start="479.479" dur="4.891">there be this prophecy where it says</text>
  <text start="481.789" dur="6.38">that these dumb dogs who are greedy and</text>
  <text start="484.37" dur="5.909">are blind and are sleeping that they say</text>
  <text start="488.169" dur="4.78">after filling themselves with strong</text>
  <text start="490.279" dur="5.371">drink that tomorrow she&amp;#39;ll be as this</text>
  <text start="492.949" dur="6.481">day and much more abundant this is a</text>
  <text start="495.65" dur="7.739">prophecy of moving a Sabbath day from</text>
  <text start="499.43" dur="6.209">Saturday to Sunday to the tomorrow the</text>
  <text start="503.389" dur="4.08">day after the Sabbath and saying it will</text>
  <text start="505.639" dur="5.761">be as the Sabbath that will be as what</text>
  <text start="507.469" dur="5.791">Saturday was so don&amp;#39;t let anyone deceive</text>
  <text start="511.4" dur="3.389">you or lie to you the Sabbath day from</text>
  <text start="513.26" dur="3.389">Friday sundown to Saturday something is</text>
  <text start="514.789" dur="4.8">very important we as believers should</text>
  <text start="516.649" dur="6.39">keep it and honor and obey it do the</text>
  <text start="519.589" dur="5.731">best we can not to work or or buy or</text>
  <text start="523.039" dur="3.781">sell but to rest to relax to spend time</text>
  <text start="525.32" dur="4.4">with our friends and family with Yahweh</text>
  <text start="526.82" dur="5.29">of course to feast this is a day that is</text>
  <text start="529.72" dur="4.82">supposed to be a blessing in</text>
  <text start="532.11" dur="3.99">is a blessing if you keep it but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.54" dur="4.229">not too polluted we&amp;#39;re not to disregard</text>
  <text start="536.1" dur="6.979">it we&amp;#39;re certainly not to change it to</text>
  <text start="538.769" dur="8.611">the next day and and we see right here</text>
  <text start="543.079" dur="7.871">800 years before Christianity even</text>
  <text start="547.38" dur="6.36">existed Isaiah prophesied that this very</text>
  <text start="550.95" dur="5.4">thing would happen so again another</text>
  <text start="553.74" dur="4.08">proof that the Sabbath day is the day</text>
  <text start="556.35" dur="3.27">that is very important that we should be</text>
  <text start="557.82" dur="4.38">honoring and keeping another proof that</text>
  <text start="559.62" dur="3.87">the scriptures are true as they promised</text>
  <text start="562.2" dur="2.819">I things that there&amp;#39;s no way anyone</text>
  <text start="563.49" dur="3.12">would know a no one knew back in</text>
  <text start="565.019" dur="3.421">Isaiah&amp;#39;s day that people would start</text>
  <text start="566.61" dur="4.2">keeping the Sabbath day on Sunday the</text>
  <text start="568.44" dur="6.209">day after said no one knew that and yet</text>
  <text start="570.81" dur="5.25">here it is clearly prophesied to all</text>
