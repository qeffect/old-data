  <text start="10.23" dur="6.719">rescuing of my children my six children</text>
  <text start="13.139" dur="6.781">that this wicked judge in Oregon cut me</text>
  <text start="16.949" dur="5.67">off from six years ago on October 30th</text>
  <text start="19.92" dur="4.29">2012 if you haven&amp;#39;t seen my original</text>
  <text start="22.619" dur="3.871">video which I made several weeks ago on</text>
  <text start="24.21" dur="4.229">Shabbat it was about help me rescue my</text>
  <text start="26.49" dur="3.75">children if you haven&amp;#39;t seen that video</text>
  <text start="28.439" dur="3.24">go watch that first I&amp;#39;ll put a link to</text>
  <text start="30.24" dur="3.81">that video right below this video but</text>
  <text start="31.679" dur="4.65">essentially the backstory is is that</text>
  <text start="34.05" dur="4.439">when my ex-wife divorced me</text>
  <text start="36.329" dur="4.951">she did not want me teaching my children</text>
  <text start="38.489" dur="5.671">about Yahweh and she actually found a</text>
  <text start="41.28" dur="5.279">judge Judge Susan L nor be from</text>
  <text start="44.16" dur="4.26">Clackamas County who basically she</text>
  <text start="46.559" dur="5.131">decided to violate the Constitution</text>
  <text start="48.42" dur="5.97">violate my rights violate all sorts of</text>
  <text start="51.69" dur="4.889">things and she made a proclamation on</text>
  <text start="54.39" dur="3.66">October 30 2012 and you can look this up</text>
  <text start="56.579" dur="3.39">in the Clackamas County records it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="58.05" dur="4.8">there she basically told me that unless</text>
  <text start="59.969" dur="5.52">I agreed to not teach my children the</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="3.96">Bible and about yah that she would not</text>
  <text start="65.489" dur="3.841">allow me to have any contact with my</text>
  <text start="66.81" dur="5.01">children and so I have not seen my</text>
  <text start="69.33" dur="4.71">children since 2010 actually I was</text>
  <text start="71.82" dur="5.4">fighting in court battles between 2010</text>
  <text start="74.04" dur="5.04">and 2012 and the final decision was made</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="5.34">on 2012 so I haven&amp;#39;t seen them for eight</text>
  <text start="79.08" dur="6.87">years no contact no email I can&amp;#39;t speak</text>
  <text start="82.56" dur="5.37">to them I mean it&amp;#39;s ridiculous and so</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="3.57">anyway in that video that I made I asked</text>
  <text start="87.93" dur="3.99">you to please help me because I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="89.52" dur="4.98">send a letter every single week to Judge</text>
  <text start="91.92" dur="4.17">Susan nor B I sent one this this this</text>
  <text start="94.5" dur="3.27">week I&amp;#39;m gonna be sending one again next</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="3.239">week every single week I&amp;#39;m gonna be</text>
  <text start="97.77" dur="4.08">sending a letter to Judge Susan or B</text>
  <text start="99.329" dur="4.771">quoting that parable that Yahshua taught</text>
  <text start="101.85" dur="4.71">where that Widow goes to that very</text>
  <text start="104.1" dur="4.199">wicked judge and she keeps begging him</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="4.169">and begging him and eventually says okay</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="4.831">fine fine fine so that&amp;#39;s the parable I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="110.729" dur="4.651">basing it on but I had another</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="3.96">subscriber who gave me another idea that</text>
  <text start="115.38" dur="2.97">I want to introduce and I think this is</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="2.73">directly because of our prayer and</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="2.79">fasting because when we when we did pray</text>

  <text start="299.26" dur="4.98">six children they&amp;#39;re mine</text>
  <text start="301.63" dur="5.4">I&amp;#39;m the father the scripture says that a</text>
  <text start="304.24" dur="4.44">father owns his children and even owns</text>
  <text start="307.03" dur="3.63">his wife I know a lot of you women don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="308.68" dur="3.99">want to hear this but it literally says</text>
  <text start="310.66" dur="4.05">in the Ten Commandments that you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="312.67" dur="4.98">to covet your neighbor&amp;#39;s wife that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.71" dur="5.67">because the man owns the wife it&amp;#39;s his</text>
  <text start="317.65" dur="4.95">most valuable piece of property and he</text>
  <text start="320.38" dur="4.41">should love her and cherish her but she</text>
  <text start="322.6" dur="3.66">is his property now we don&amp;#39;t like to</text>
  <text start="324.79" dur="2.76">think about that in our Western mindset</text>
  <text start="326.26" dur="3.84">because we think of property is like</text>
  <text start="327.55" dur="5.04">disposable no that&amp;#39;s not how the Hebraic</text>
  <text start="330.1" dur="3.96">thought is at all if you have a piece of</text>
  <text start="332.59" dur="3.12">property like your wife you&amp;#39;re to love</text>
  <text start="334.06" dur="3.99">her you&amp;#39;re to cherish her here to honor</text>
  <text start="335.71" dur="5.52">her here to protect her and and and</text>
  <text start="338.05" dur="5.55">you&amp;#39;re to lay your life down for her but</text>
  <text start="341.23" dur="4.71">the children don&amp;#39;t belong to her the</text>
  <text start="343.6" dur="5.43">children and her belong to the man that</text>
  <text start="345.94" dur="4.979">is the order that was established and if</text>
  <text start="349.03" dur="4.86">the man is truly laying down his wife</text>
  <text start="350.919" dur="5.491">his life for his wife then she should</text>
  <text start="353.89" dur="6.12">have no problem summing them but in this</text>
  <text start="356.41" dur="5.16">case has been a big problem and I need</text>
  <text start="360.01" dur="4.53">to get my children back there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361.57" dur="5.099">mine they&amp;#39;re mine y&amp;#39;all gave them to me</text>

  <text start="378.79" dur="4.08">characteristics for Philadelphia which</text>
  <text start="381.22" dur="3.33">is the one assembly that&amp;#39;s kept from you</text>
  <text start="382.87" dur="3.69">so I&amp;#39;ll continue to wait I&amp;#39;ll continue</text>

  <text start="429.639" dur="4.171">shalt not covet your neighbor&amp;#39;s house</text>
  <text start="431.41" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s his property you shall not covet</text>
  <text start="433.81" dur="4.29">your neighbor&amp;#39;s wife that&amp;#39;s his property</text>
