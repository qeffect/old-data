  <text start="0.41" dur="6.87">Shalom this is the first video that will</text>
  <text start="3.57" dur="7.38">provide irrefutable proof that Jesus or</text>
  <text start="7.28" dur="5.71">Yahshua as his Hebrew name is rose from</text>
  <text start="10.95" dur="6.81">the dead that the resurrection actually</text>
  <text start="12.99" dur="8.789">occurred I just want to preface this by</text>
  <text start="17.76" dur="6.21">saying that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very important</text>
  <text start="21.779" dur="4.441">understand that in order to prove that</text>
  <text start="23.97" dur="4.979">the resurrection occurred you do not</text>
  <text start="26.22" dur="4.469">need to assume that the New Testament is</text>
  <text start="28.949" dur="3.571">inspired by God or that it&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="30.689" dur="4.14">trustworthy okay you don&amp;#39;t need that now</text>
  <text start="32.52" dur="5.219">of course I do believe that the New</text>
  <text start="34.829" dur="5">Testament the Brit hadashah the renewed</text>
  <text start="37.739" dur="5.91">keV and I I do believe that it is true</text>
  <text start="39.829" dur="6.46">but you do not need to believe that it</text>
  <text start="43.649" dur="5.031">is true in order to prove that Jesus</text>
  <text start="46.289" dur="6.2">resurrected that he rose from the dead</text>
  <text start="48.68" dur="6.07">okay the first truth is the empty tomb</text>
  <text start="52.489" dur="4.061">this is the fact that you have the tomb</text>
  <text start="54.75" dur="4.71">in which Jesus was buried was discovered</text>
  <text start="56.55" dur="5.97">empty by a group of women on the Sunday</text>
  <text start="59.46" dur="4.8">following the crucifixion yet what</text>
  <text start="62.52" dur="3.209">evidence do we have that the tomb in</text>
  <text start="64.26" dur="3.78">which Jesus was buried was discovered</text>
  <text start="65.729" dur="5.701">empty by a group of women on the Sunday</text>
  <text start="68.04" dur="4.619">following the crucifixion well the first</text>
  <text start="71.43" dur="2.939">piece of evidence we have is the</text>
  <text start="72.659" dur="4.861">resurrection was preached in the same</text>
  <text start="74.369" dur="6.211">city where Jesus Yahshua had been buried</text>
  <text start="77.52" dur="5.4">shortly before Joshua&amp;#39;s disciples did</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="4.109">not go to some obscure place or no one</text>
  <text start="82.92" dur="3.96">had heard of Jesus to begin preaching</text>
  <text start="84.689" dur="4.441">about the resurrection but instead they</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="4.86">began preaching in Jerusalem the very</text>
  <text start="89.13" dur="5.37">city where Yahshua had died and been</text>
  <text start="91.74" dur="5.19">buried they could not have done this if</text>
  <text start="94.5" dur="4.29">Yahshua was still in his tomb no one</text>
  <text start="96.93" dur="3.299">would have believed them no one would</text>
  <text start="98.79" dur="3.39">have been foolish enough to believe a</text>
  <text start="100.229" dur="4.471">man had raised from the dead when his</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="4.86">body lay dead in the tomb for all to see</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="3.629">I mean think about it all the Jews would</text>
  <text start="107.04" dur="3.57">have to do all the Romans would have to</text>
  <text start="108.329" dur="2.461">do is just go to the tomb and say excuse</text>
  <text start="110.61" dur="1.98">me</text>
  <text start="110.79" dur="5.46">his body is right here what these guys</text>
  <text start="112.59" dur="6.93">are saying is false there&amp;#39;s a scholar</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="5.64">his name is Paul Offit Alphaeus it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="119.52" dur="5.849">spelled Paul like Paul pa ul and his</text>
  <text start="121.89" dur="5.31">last name is al th aus he writes the</text>
  <text start="125.369" dur="3.931">Resurrection Proclamation could not have</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="4.35">been maintained in Jerusalem for a</text>
  <text start="129.3" dur="4.11">single day for a single hour</text>
  <text start="131.55" dur="2.25">if the emptiness of the tomb had not</text>
  <text start="133.41" dur="3.95">been a</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="6.51">tablished as a fact for all concerned</text>
  <text start="137.36" dur="4.81">the second piece of proof is the</text>
  <text start="140.31" dur="4.17">earliest Jewish arguments against</text>
  <text start="142.17" dur="4.92">Christianity admit the empty tomb</text>
  <text start="144.48" dur="5.4">if you meet read Matthew chapter 28</text>
  <text start="147.09" dur="5.34">verses 11 through 15 there is a</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="4.74">reference made to the Jews attempt to</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="4.83">refute Christianity by saying that the</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="4.83">disciples stole the body now this is</text>
  <text start="157.26" dur="4.86">significant because it shows that the</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="4.86">Jews did not deny the empty tomb instead</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="3.9">their stolen body theory admitted the</text>
  <text start="164.31" dur="4.95">significant truth that the tomb was in</text>
  <text start="166.02" dur="4.95">fact empty now you don&amp;#39;t have to rely on</text>
  <text start="169.26" dur="2.91">the book of Matthew so if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="170.97" dur="2.22">believe the Bible is true you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="172.17" dur="4.05">to rely on the book of Matthew to</text>
  <text start="173.19" dur="7.65">establish this the toilet off Jess ooh</text>
  <text start="176.22" dur="6.18">ok that&amp;#39;s spelled T Oh led oth Jessie J</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="3.81">II guess you I&amp;#39;ll put that in the</text>
  <text start="182.4" dur="5.49">information to at the bottom of this</text>
  <text start="184.65" dur="6.09">YouTube it&amp;#39;s a compilation of early</text>
  <text start="187.89" dur="5.85">Jewish writings is another source</text>
  <text start="190.74" dur="5.25">acknowledging this it acknowledges that</text>
  <text start="193.74" dur="5.1">the tomb was empty and attempts to</text>
  <text start="195.99" dur="4.98">explain it away further we have a record</text>
  <text start="198.84" dur="4.56">of a second century debate between a</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="4.14">Christian and a Jew in which a reference</text>
  <text start="203.4" dur="3.839">is made to the fact that the Jews claim</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="4.17">the body was stolen so it&amp;#39;s pretty well</text>
  <text start="207.239" dur="4.741">established that the early Jews admitted</text>
  <text start="209.28" dur="5.28">the empty tomb now why is this so</text>
  <text start="211.98" dur="4.59">important remember that the Jewish</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="4.26">leaders were completely opposed to</text>
  <text start="216.57" dur="5.22">Christianity they were hostile witnesses</text>
  <text start="218.82" dur="4.98">in acknowledging the empty tomb that</text>
  <text start="221.79" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re basically admitting the reality</text>
  <text start="223.8" dur="4.05">of a fact that was certainly not in</text>
  <text start="225.27" dur="4.62">their favor so why would they admit that</text>
  <text start="227.85" dur="4.83">the tomb was empty unless the evidence</text>
  <text start="229.89" dur="4.71">was too strong to be denied there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="232.68" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s a man named Tucker dr. Paul</text>
  <text start="234.6" dur="5.52">Meyers last name is spelled ma ier</text>
  <text start="237.54" dur="5.1">he calls this positive evidence from a</text>
  <text start="240.12" dur="4.47">hostile source in essence if a source</text>
  <text start="242.64" dur="2.52">admits a fact that is decidedly not in</text>
  <text start="244.59" dur="4.29">its favor</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="5.91">the fact is genuine third the empty tomb</text>
  <text start="248.88" dur="3.84">account in the Gospel of Mark is based</text>
  <text start="251.07" dur="3.96">upon a source that originated within</text>
  <text start="252.72" dur="5.13">seven years of the event at narrates</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="5.31">this place is the evidence for the empty</text>
  <text start="257.85" dur="4.199">tomb too early to be legendary that</text>
  <text start="260.34" dur="4.199">makes it much more likely that it is</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="4.651">accurate what is the evidence for this</text>
  <text start="264.539" dur="2.911">I&amp;#39;m going to list two different pieces</text>
  <text start="266.7" dur="2.31">here</text>
  <text start="267.45" dur="4.11">first there&amp;#39;s a german commentator on</text>
  <text start="269.01" dur="6.18">mark his name is Rudolph Pesche last</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="6.18">minute spelled PE SCH he points out that</text>
  <text start="275.19" dur="5.58">this pre Markin source never mentions</text>
  <text start="277.74" dur="4.86">the high priest by name this implies</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="3.48">that Caiaphas who we know was high</text>
  <text start="282.6" dur="3.36">priest at that time was still high</text>
  <text start="284.25" dur="3.72">priest when the story began circulating</text>
  <text start="285.96" dur="3.87">for if it had been written after</text>
  <text start="287.97" dur="3.24">Caiaphas&amp;#39;s term of office his name would</text>
  <text start="289.83" dur="2.94">have had to have been used to</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="4.35">distinguish him from the next high</text>
  <text start="292.77" dur="6.57">priests but since Caiaphas was high</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="5.94">priest from AD basically in the early</text>
  <text start="299.34" dur="5.01">1st century for like you know from</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="6.24">basically 80 within the first thirty</text>
  <text start="304.35" dur="5.19">years of the of the 1st century this the</text>
  <text start="307.74" dur="4.41">story could not have begin circulating</text>
  <text start="309.54" dur="7.53">any later than the very beginning of</text>
  <text start="312.15" dur="6.27">that first century furthermore this man</text>
  <text start="317.07" dur="3.29">perch argues that since Paul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.42" dur="5.24">traditions concerning the Last Supper</text>
  <text start="320.36" dur="5.35">which are written in 1st Corinthians 11</text>
  <text start="323.66" dur="3.88">presuppose the mark an account</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="3.42">this implies that the marking source</text>
  <text start="327.54" dur="4.08">goes right back to the early years of</text>
  <text start="329.13" dur="5.01">Christianity so the early source mark</text>
  <text start="331.62" dur="7.86">used puts the testimony of the Institute</text>
  <text start="334.14" dur="7.56">and too early to be legendary fourth the</text>
  <text start="339.48" dur="4.65">empty tomb is supported by the</text>
  <text start="341.7" dur="4.86">historical reliability of the burial</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="4.29">story new testament scholars agreed that</text>
  <text start="346.56" dur="4.02">the burial story is one of the best</text>
  <text start="348.42" dur="5.73">established facts about Yahshua about</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="5.82">Jesus one reason for this is because of</text>
  <text start="354.15" dur="5.28">the inclusion of Joseph of Arimathea</text>
  <text start="356.4" dur="4.74">as the one who buried Christ now Joseph</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="4.71">he was a member of the Jewish Sanhedrin</text>
  <text start="361.14" dur="6.81">okay that&amp;#39;s like the Jewish Supreme</text>
  <text start="364.14" dur="5.7">Court of the 1st century and people on</text>
  <text start="367.95" dur="4.74">this ruling class were simply too well</text>
  <text start="369.84" dur="4.83">known for the you know fictitious</text>
  <text start="372.69" dur="4.65">legendary stories to just be invented</text>
  <text start="374.67" dur="5.49">about them so that people would believe</text>
  <text start="377.34" dur="4.71">it couldn&amp;#39;t happen this would have been</text>
  <text start="380.16" dur="3.66">exposed and then the Christians would</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="3.93">have been shown as frauds right at the</text>
  <text start="383.82" dur="3.93">very beginning of the first century so</text>
  <text start="385.98" dur="4.62">they couldn&amp;#39;t have circulators a story</text>
  <text start="387.75" dur="6.21">about Joseph of Arimathea burying Jesus</text>
  <text start="390.6" dur="5.34">unless it was true also if the burial</text>
  <text start="393.96" dur="4.17">count was legendary one would expect to</text>
  <text start="395.94" dur="4.08">find conflicting traditions like a lot</text>
  <text start="398.13" dur="5.999">of different versions of the story</text>
  <text start="400.02" dur="6.239">we don&amp;#39;t have any of those at all okay</text>
  <text start="404.129" dur="4.19">so how does the reliability of Jesus&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.259" dur="4.921">burial argue that the tomb was empty</text>
  <text start="408.319" dur="4.84">because the burial account an empty tomb</text>
  <text start="411.18" dur="4.739">account have grammatical and linguistic</text>
  <text start="413.159" dur="6.151">ties indicating it their one continuous</text>
  <text start="415.919" dur="5.701">account so basically if the burial</text>
  <text start="419.31" dur="6.09">account is accurate the empty tomb is</text>
  <text start="421.62" dur="5.28">likely to be acted as well further if</text>
  <text start="425.4" dur="3.54">the burial account is accurate then</text>
  <text start="426.9" dur="4.59">everyone knew where Jesus was buried</text>
  <text start="428.94" dur="4.05">this would have been decisive evidence</text>
  <text start="431.49" dur="3.6">to refute the early Christians who are</text>
  <text start="432.99" dur="4.049">preaching the resurrection for if the</text>
  <text start="435.09" dur="3.87">tomb had not been empty it would have</text>
  <text start="437.039" dur="3.72">been evident to all and the disciples</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="6.51">would have been exposed as frauds or at</text>
  <text start="440.759" dur="7.351">worst basically insane v Jesus&amp;#39;s tomb</text>
  <text start="445.47" dur="6.419">was never venerated as a shrine now this</text>
  <text start="448.11" dur="5.429">is very important it it&amp;#39;s important to</text>
  <text start="451.889" dur="4.411">realize that in the in the first century</text>
  <text start="453.539" dur="5.85">there was a custom to set up a shrine at</text>
  <text start="456.3" dur="5.16">the site of a holy man&amp;#39;s bones okay so</text>
  <text start="459.389" dur="5.4">whenever someone believed that someone</text>
  <text start="461.46" dur="5.13">had lived a holy life and at the site of</text>
  <text start="464.789" dur="3.211">where their bones was buried they would</text>
  <text start="466.59" dur="3.35">set up these shrines and that that was a</text>
  <text start="468" dur="5.58">very common custom in the 1st century</text>
  <text start="469.94" dur="7.21">there were at least 50 such shrines in</text>
  <text start="473.58" dur="5.88">the early 1st century but there was no</text>
  <text start="477.15" dur="7.5">such shrine ever erected for Jesus so it</text>
  <text start="479.46" dur="7.019">suggests that his bones weren&amp;#39;t there 6</text>
  <text start="484.65" dur="4.049">Mark&amp;#39;s account of the empty tomb is</text>
  <text start="486.479" dur="5.43">simple and shows no signs of legendary</text>
  <text start="488.699" dur="4.741">development now this is very very</text>
  <text start="491.909" dur="3.931">apparent when you compare it with the</text>
  <text start="493.44" dur="4.37">gospel of Peter which is a forgery it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="495.84" dur="7.02">it&amp;#39;s this legend that was written about</text>
  <text start="497.81" dur="7.21">125 C II this legend of the gospel of</text>
  <text start="502.86" dur="3.899">Peter it has all of the Jewish leaders</text>
  <text start="505.02" dur="3.299">and Roman guards and many people from</text>
  <text start="506.759" dur="3.331">the countryside they&amp;#39;re gathered to</text>
  <text start="508.319" dur="3.72">watch the resurrection and then these</text>
  <text start="510.09" dur="3.09">these 3 men come out of the tomb and</text>
  <text start="512.039" dur="2.67">their heads are reaching up to the</text>
  <text start="513.18" dur="3.93">clouds and then there&amp;#39;s this talking</text>
  <text start="514.709" dur="4.08">cross that comes out of the tomb I mean</text>
  <text start="517.11" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a legend you can tell she&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="518.789" dur="5.25">silly fabrication but you don&amp;#39;t see any</text>
  <text start="521.55" dur="5.25">of that type of thing in mark&amp;#39;s account</text>
  <text start="524.039" dur="6.66">of the empty tomb or anywhere else in</text>
  <text start="526.8" dur="6.06">the gospels for that matter 7th the tomb</text>
  <text start="530.699" dur="3.721">was discovered empty by women</text>
  <text start="532.86" dur="2.94">now this is it this is extremely</text>
  <text start="534.42" dur="4.68">important and probably some of the most</text>
  <text start="535.8" dur="5.31">compelling evidence the testimony of</text>
  <text start="539.1" dur="6.36">women in first century Jewish culture</text>
  <text start="541.11" dur="6.24">was considered worthless okay if the</text>
  <text start="545.46" dur="3.6">empty tomb were a legend that it most</text>
  <text start="547.35" dur="3.06">likely that the male disciples would</text>
  <text start="549.06" dur="5.07">have been made the first to discover the</text>
  <text start="550.41" dur="5.76">empty tomb because this would give the</text>
  <text start="554.13" dur="5.01">the legend or the made-up story more</text>
  <text start="556.17" dur="4.83">more credibility the fact that despised</text>
  <text start="559.14" dur="4.5">women whose testimony was deemed</text>
  <text start="561" dur="4.38">worthless where the chief witnesses to</text>
  <text start="563.64" dur="4.62">the fact of the empty tomb can only be</text>
  <text start="565.38" dur="4.92">plausibly explained if like it or not</text>
  <text start="568.26" dur="7.53">they actually were the discoverers of</text>
  <text start="570.3" dur="7.17">the empty tomb okay so that&amp;#39;s extremely</text>
  <text start="575.79" dur="3.9">important to understand this I mean in</text>
  <text start="577.47" dur="4.47">the first century Jewish culture in the</text>
  <text start="579.69" dur="4.74">first century Roman culture I mean oh</text>
  <text start="581.94" dur="6.63">the testimony of a woman was basically</text>
  <text start="584.43" dur="5.43">deemed worthless so if this story had</text>
  <text start="588.57" dur="3.15">just been invented why would they say</text>
  <text start="589.86" dur="6.81">women discovered the tomb it would make</text>
  <text start="591.72" dur="7.44">no sense because of the strong evidence</text>
  <text start="596.67" dur="5.52">of the empty tomb most recent scholars</text>
  <text start="599.16" dur="6.36">did not deny it there&amp;#39;s a man named D H</text>
  <text start="602.19" dur="6.9">van Dalen his last name is spelled d AAL</text>
  <text start="605.52" dur="5.61">en he said it is extremely difficult to</text>
  <text start="609.09" dur="2.46">object to the empty tomb on historical</text>

  <text start="624.66" dur="6.27">New Testament critic has said by for by</text>
  <text start="628.23" dur="4.89">far most exegetes hold firmly to the</text>
  <text start="630.93" dur="4.5">reliability of the biblical statements</text>
  <text start="633.12" dur="4.38">about the empty tomb and then he lists</text>
  <text start="635.43" dur="6.33">you know 28 scholars to back up his</text>
  <text start="637.5" dur="5.97">fantastic claim now of course I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="641.76" dur="3.36">that a lot of you listening to this new</text>
  <text start="643.47" dur="3.48">team you&amp;#39;ve heard of like the various</text>
  <text start="645.12" dur="3.89">theories used to explain away the empty</text>
  <text start="646.95" dur="4.98">tomb such as that the body was stolen</text>
  <text start="649.01" dur="5.62">but those theories are laughed at today</text>
  <text start="651.93" dur="4.5">by all serious scholars in fact there</text>
  <text start="654.63" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;ve been considered dead and refuted</text>
  <text start="656.43" dur="4.38">for almost a hundred years now and let</text>
  <text start="659.52" dur="3.99">me just give you some examples as to why</text>
  <text start="660.81" dur="4.8">this is the Jews or the Romans had no</text>
  <text start="663.51" dur="2.95">motive to steal the body okay they</text>
  <text start="665.61" dur="4.03">wanted to say</text>
  <text start="666.46" dur="5.04">Press Christianity not encourage it by</text>
  <text start="669.64" dur="3.78">providing it with an empty tomb okay so</text>
  <text start="671.5" dur="4.41">they would have had no motive to steal</text>
  <text start="673.42" dur="4.41">that body in fact they had every motive</text>
  <text start="675.91" dur="3.51">to simply produce the body take the body</text>
  <text start="677.83" dur="3.87">out of the tomb and parade it before</text>
  <text start="679.42" dur="4.62">everyone in public to prove that that</text>
  <text start="681.7" dur="6.18">these Christians were insane that they</text>
  <text start="684.04" dur="6.48">were frauds but they never did that now</text>
  <text start="687.88" dur="4.65">the disciples had no motive either to</text>
  <text start="690.52" dur="3.39">steal the body because of their</text>
  <text start="692.53" dur="4.53">preaching on the resurrection they were</text>
  <text start="693.91" dur="4.95">beaten killed and persecuted so why</text>
  <text start="697.06" dur="5.19">would they go through all of that for a</text>
  <text start="698.86" dur="4.77">deliberate lie I mean in other words if</text>
  <text start="702.25" dur="3.23">they had stolen the body and then like</text>
  <text start="703.63" dur="6.18">burned it somewhere or whatever</text>
  <text start="705.48" dur="6.67">what show me an evidence of a single</text>

  <text start="724.33" dur="9.09">theories today so what explanation then</text>
  <text start="727.84" dur="7.56">do the critics offer well basically they</text>
  <text start="733.42" dur="3.36">are self confessedly without any</text>
  <text start="735.4" dur="4.26">explanation to offer</text>
  <text start="736.78" dur="5.52">there is simply no plausible natural</text>
  <text start="739.66" dur="5.46">explanation today to account for Jesus&amp;#39;s</text>
