  <text start="10.38" dur="5.49">this is part 14 of my 17 part series of</text>
  <text start="14.009" dur="5.28">reconciling the teachings of Messiah</text>
  <text start="15.87" dur="8.069">Yahshua and Apostle Paul rabbi shai wool</text>
  <text start="19.289" dur="6.361">and this is part 14 of 17 Hebrews 7 the</text>
  <text start="23.939" dur="5.25">priests of mikela Dec versus the priests</text>
  <text start="25.65" dur="6.119">of the Levites now in this chapter</text>

  <text start="37.62" dur="3.689">leave the local priesthood has been done</text>
  <text start="39.39" dur="5.25">away with we have the mikkel verdict</text>
  <text start="41.309" dur="5.851">priesthood and this causes the Torah to</text>
  <text start="44.64" dur="5.099">pass away and this is not what this</text>
  <text start="47.16" dur="4.23">passage is saying because if if that</text>
  <text start="49.739" dur="4.681">indeed was what the passage was saying</text>
  <text start="51.39" dur="5.579">you have a huge problem because Yahshua</text>
  <text start="54.42" dur="5.159">says very clearly in Matthew 5:17</text>
  <text start="56.969" dur="4.951">through 20 he says until the heavens and</text>
  <text start="59.579" dur="5.281">earth pass away not one jot or tittle</text>
  <text start="61.92" dur="5.76">from the tour will pass away well the</text>
  <text start="64.86" dur="5.04">Levites Levitical priesthood and the</text>
  <text start="67.68" dur="3.869">animal sacrifices and all the carnal</text>
  <text start="69.9" dur="3.63">ordinances that they were instructed to</text>
  <text start="71.549" dur="4.801">do those are Jocelin to those of the</text>
  <text start="73.53" dur="5.49">Torah and because the heavens and earth</text>
  <text start="76.35" dur="5.28">have not passed away yet in fact they</text>
  <text start="79.02" dur="4.95">will not pass away until after the</text>
  <text start="81.63" dur="5.79">millennial kingdom the 1000 year reign</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="6.719">of Messiah you can&amp;#39;t throw away those</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="8.129">jobs until so we&amp;#39;re going to find out</text>
  <text start="90.689" dur="6.18">what Hebrews 7 is actually saying so</text>
  <text start="95.549" dur="4.081">we&amp;#39;re going to get right into it here so</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="5.521">in Hebrews chapter 7 it starts off</text>
  <text start="99.63" dur="7.83">talking about this king of McKelvey Beck</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="8.549">was king of Salem and how Abraham gave</text>
  <text start="107.46" dur="4.769">ties to him and Levi of course would</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="5.491">eventually come out of the loins of</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="5.731">Abraham through his descendants what</text>
  <text start="116.43" dur="2.82">this is showing here is right at the</text>
  <text start="117.96" dur="3.659">outset there&amp;#39;s a principle established</text>
  <text start="119.25" dur="5.729">and that is is that the mikkel the Dec</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="6.601">order priesthood is superior to the</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="6.541">Levitical priesthood and then the writer</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="4.59">of hebrews and by the way i do tend to</text>
  <text start="131.52" dur="3.719">believe Hebrews was written by</text>
  <text start="132.81" dur="4.23">all just because of the writing style</text>
  <text start="135.239" dur="4.5">seems very similar to Paul&amp;#39;s writing</text>
  <text start="137.04" dur="4.29">style I may not be exactly correct on</text>
  <text start="139.739" dur="3.931">that but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I leaned</text>
  <text start="141.33" dur="6.03">toward so I&amp;#39;m just assuming that this</text>
  <text start="143.67" dur="5.76">has been written by Apostle Paul but</text>
  <text start="147.36" dur="6.08">then what Paul does is he goes through</text>
  <text start="149.43" dur="7.559">this seventh chapter is he shows how</text>
  <text start="153.44" dur="5.62">this Levitical priesthood is inferior to</text>
  <text start="156.989" dur="3.991">the mikkel boudic priesthood how the</text>
  <text start="159.06" dur="4.38">Levitical priesthood was never designed</text>
  <text start="160.98" dur="4.47">to make someone perfect that that could</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="4.76">only be done through the Mikkel detector</text>
  <text start="165.45" dur="5.67">that can only be done through Yahshua</text>
  <text start="168.2" dur="6.069">who is now the high priest McKelvey</text>
  <text start="171.12" dur="5.19">decreased so very clearly it shows that</text>
  <text start="174.269" dur="3.451">this McElveen ik priesthood is superior</text>
  <text start="176.31" dur="4.32">to Levitical priesthood</text>
  <text start="177.72" dur="5.73">however showing that the McElveen tech</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="5.73">priesthood is superior to the Levitical</text>
  <text start="183.45" dur="6.72">priesthood does not nullify or do away</text>
  <text start="186.36" dur="5.97">with Levitical priesthood remember the</text>
  <text start="190.17" dur="5.429">purpose of Torah many times they are</text>
  <text start="192.33" dur="5.249">shadow of things to come right so</text>
  <text start="195.599" dur="4.831">Levitical priesthood of course pointed</text>
  <text start="197.579" dur="3.78">toward Yahshua the feast days as we</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="2.85">talked about in other part and</text>
  <text start="201.359" dur="3.961">Colossians they point toward things that</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="5.94">are still in the future still yet to be</text>
  <text start="205.32" dur="6.81">fulfilled by the Messiah Yahshua so by</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="5.4">saying that Yahshua who is the mikkel</text>
  <text start="212.13" dur="5.09">the deck priest that he is superior to</text>
  <text start="214.62" dur="5.94">the litical priesthood doesn&amp;#39;t nullify</text>
  <text start="217.22" dur="4.87">the Levites doesn&amp;#39;t nullify their carnal</text>
  <text start="220.56" dur="3.59">Commandments and the things that they do</text>
  <text start="222.09" dur="8.729">and I&amp;#39;m going to I&amp;#39;m going to prove that</text>
  <text start="224.15" dur="9.25">so if we go to Malachi chapter 3 it</text>
  <text start="230.819" dur="7.5">talks about both the the first and the</text>
  <text start="233.4" dur="6.78">second coming of Yahshua and in verse 2</text>
  <text start="238.319" dur="5.07">Malachi 3 verse 2 it&amp;#39;s specifically</text>
  <text start="240.18" dur="5.339">referring to Joshua&amp;#39;s second return this</text>
  <text start="243.389" dur="5.011">second coming it says but who made by</text>
  <text start="245.519" dur="5.581">abide the day of his coming and who</text>
  <text start="248.4" dur="5.85">shall stand when he appears he is like a</text>
  <text start="251.1" dur="5.609">refiners fire and like fuller soap now</text>
  <text start="254.25" dur="5.07">going on to verse 3 and he that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="256.709" dur="5.371">Messiah shall sit as a refiner and</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="5.19">purifier of silver and he shall purify</text>
  <text start="262.08" dur="5.43">the sons of Levi</text>
  <text start="264.51" dur="5.79">and purge them as gold and silver that</text>
  <text start="267.51" dur="5.97">they may offer unto Yahweh on offering</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="5.37">in righteousness then shall the offering</text>
  <text start="273.48" dur="5.46">of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto</text>
  <text start="275.67" dur="6.21">Yahweh as in the days of old and as in</text>
  <text start="278.94" dur="7.53">former years that is Malachi chapter 3</text>
  <text start="281.88" dur="6.96">verses 2 through 4 so this is referring</text>
  <text start="286.47" dur="5.13">to his second return this is referring</text>
  <text start="288.84" dur="4.59">to then the Millennial Kingdom and so</text>
  <text start="291.6" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s very clear that Yahshua is going to</text>
  <text start="293.43" dur="5.01">purge and purify and re-establish the</text>
  <text start="296.46" dur="4.8">Levitical priesthood to continue to</text>
  <text start="298.44" dur="3.87">carry on all these sacrifices and all</text>
  <text start="301.26" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re going to do all these sacrifices</text>
  <text start="302.31" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;ll do is just point back toward what</text>
  <text start="304.23" dur="4.32">Yahshua did just like when we keep</text>
  <text start="306.09" dur="4.73">Passover II every year it&amp;#39;s Memorial and</text>
  <text start="308.55" dur="8.07">it points back toward what Yahshua</text>
  <text start="310.82" dur="7.3">already fulfilled so now again Yahshua</text>
  <text start="316.62" dur="4.32">so what we&amp;#39;re going to see in the</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="4.71">Millennial Kingdom is what is very</text>
  <text start="320.94" dur="3.9">clearly depicted in Hebrews 7 and that</text>
  <text start="322.83" dur="3.6">is that you will have the McElveen</text>
  <text start="324.84" dur="3.6">increase if you&amp;#39;ll have Yahshua ruling</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="3.57">and reigning from Jerusalem and then</text>
  <text start="328.44" dur="2.91">you&amp;#39;ll have the Levitical priesthood as</text>
  <text start="330" dur="3.21">well doing all the things that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.35" dur="3.99">supposed to do but that Levitical</text>
  <text start="333.21" dur="4.08">priesthood will simply be submitted to</text>
  <text start="335.34" dur="5.28">the mikela deck priesthood they&amp;#39;ll both</text>
  <text start="337.29" dur="5.19">be functioning but one of course will be</text>
  <text start="340.62" dur="4.59">inferior Levitical Krista will be</text>
  <text start="342.48" dur="4.44">inferior to the McElveen priesthood</text>
  <text start="345.21" dur="6.69">which is superior and that is exactly</text>
  <text start="346.92" dur="6.66">what Ebru 7 shows us it shows that the</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="4.62">mikkel detect priesthood Yahshua our</text>
  <text start="353.58" dur="4.95">high priest who is the only one that can</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="5.54">actually make us perfect who can</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="7.44">actually purify us and make us blameless</text>
  <text start="362.06" dur="6.07">that he is superior to the Levitical</text>
  <text start="365.97" dur="6.3">priesthood which all of the things that</text>
  <text start="368.13" dur="7.29">they do simply point toward him so that</text>
  <text start="372.27" dur="6.75">is what Hebrews 7 is is very clearly</text>
  <text start="375.42" dur="5.13">showing and it also that this</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="6">understanding now reconciles with</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="6.36">Joshua&amp;#39;s words in Matthew 5:17 through</text>
  <text start="385.02" dur="4.26">20 which I&amp;#39;ll just read it here because</text>
  <text start="386.91" dur="3.84">I know we went over this in the in the</text>
  <text start="389.28" dur="3.33">first video but I think it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="390.75" dur="2.9">important just to read Yahshua&amp;#39;s actual</text>
  <text start="392.61" dur="5.54">words</text>
  <text start="393.65" dur="7.799">so I will do so because this is a</text>
  <text start="398.15" dur="5.37">foundational teaching that he gave you</text>
  <text start="401.449" dur="3.841">know that you have to reconcile with</text>
  <text start="403.52" dur="6.39">everything else is being written so</text>
  <text start="405.29" dur="6.72">Matthew 5:17 to 20 think not that I come</text>
  <text start="409.91" dur="4.74">to destroy the Torah or the prophets I</text>
  <text start="412.01" dur="5.61">not come to destroy but to fulfil or to</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="5.34">fill up to revive for verily I say into</text>
  <text start="417.62" dur="5.22">you until the heaven and earth pass not</text>
  <text start="419.99" dur="4.47">one jot or one tittle shall pass from</text>
  <text start="422.84" dur="5.73">the Torah till everything is</text>
  <text start="424.46" dur="6">accomplished so heaven on earth has not</text>
  <text start="428.57" dur="3.69">passed heaven the heavens are still</text>
  <text start="430.46" dur="4.38">above us the earth is still beneath us</text>
  <text start="432.26" dur="5.219">so it&amp;#39;s very clear that none of these</text>
  <text start="434.84" dur="3.69">got some fiddles have tasks now do we</text>
  <text start="437.479" dur="2.851">have a little bit of priesthood</text>
  <text start="438.53" dur="4.5">functioning now no we don&amp;#39;t it was</text>
  <text start="440.33" dur="4.47">destroyed in 70 AD it was judgment that</text>
  <text start="443.03" dur="4.32">was that Yahshua had prophesied about</text>
  <text start="444.8" dur="4.739">that would come upon his people for for</text>
  <text start="447.35" dur="6">the leadership basically rejecting the</text>
  <text start="449.539" dur="5.88">Messiah and this Levitical priesthood</text>
  <text start="453.35" dur="4.8">will not be fully purified and brought</text>
  <text start="455.419" dur="4.051">back until Yahshua&amp;#39;s second return now</text>
  <text start="458.15" dur="4.739">they&amp;#39;re going to attempt to try to do a</text>
  <text start="459.47" dur="5.94">sort of a counterfeit version of this in</text>
  <text start="462.889" dur="4.141">Jerusalem during the time of the</text>
  <text start="465.41" dur="3.18">Antichrist okay and the Antichrist is</text>
  <text start="467.03" dur="2.88">going to pollute that temple and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.59" dur="4.139">going to be a whole counterfeit version</text>
  <text start="469.91" dur="4.35">so none of this Levitical priesthood</text>
  <text start="472.729" dur="3.931">stuff it&amp;#39;s going to be brought back</text>
  <text start="474.26" dur="5.04">until after we&amp;#39;ve been resurrected we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="476.66" dur="3.99">we army Joshua in the air we return</text>
  <text start="479.3" dur="4.589">within and we are ruling and reigning</text>
  <text start="480.65" dur="6.12">with him that is when that time will be</text>
  <text start="483.889" dur="4.291">according to Malachi chapter 3 so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="486.77" dur="5.91">very cliff it&amp;#39;s very important also to</text>
  <text start="488.18" dur="6.69">get our our timing correct and again</text>
  <text start="492.68" dur="3.959">this goes back to the whole idea and the</text>
  <text start="494.87" dur="5.13">whole one of the whole purposes of this</text>
  <text start="496.639" dur="5.34">series is to show what both Apostle Paul</text>
  <text start="500" dur="5.699">and Messiah was with teaching and that</text>
  <text start="501.979" dur="6.181">is we do all we can to obey the Torah in</text>
  <text start="505.699" dur="4.801">our present day culture obviously the</text>
  <text start="508.16" dur="5.4">Levitical priesthood and all the laws</text>
  <text start="510.5" dur="4.74">and commandments associated with the</text>
  <text start="513.56" dur="4.08">local priesthood cannot be done those</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="5.4">things cannot be done because there is</text>
  <text start="517.64" dur="5.04">no Levitical priesthood right now so we</text>
  <text start="520.64" dur="4.41">do all that we can do in Torah we do as</text>
  <text start="522.68" dur="3.64">much as we can out of a love for Yahshua</text>
  <text start="525.05" dur="4.12">this should be a hot</text>
  <text start="526.32" dur="4.98">the heart of a true believer but</text>
  <text start="529.17" dur="4.17">nevertheless because Yahshua said not</text>
  <text start="531.3" dur="3.75">one jot or tittle will pass away we know</text>
  <text start="533.34" dur="4.62">that these things have not passed away</text>
  <text start="535.05" dur="6.12">there&amp;#39;s been a pause a 2000 year pause</text>
  <text start="537.96" dur="5.19">put on on this section of Torah but it</text>
  <text start="541.17" dur="5.19">will come back according to Malachi 3</text>
  <text start="543.15" dur="5.31">and if you go to Zechariah 14 which also</text>
  <text start="546.36" dur="4.92">very clearly describes the Millennial</text>
  <text start="548.46" dur="4.77">Kingdom and how any nation that does not</text>
  <text start="551.28" dur="4.95">come up to Jerusalem for Sukkot will not</text>
  <text start="553.23" dur="6.09">receive any rain the last few verses of</text>
  <text start="556.23" dur="6.08">that chapter also show and talk about</text>
  <text start="559.32" dur="5.52">the sacrifices being done by a</text>
  <text start="562.31" dur="4.84">reestablished Levitical priesthood under</text>
  <text start="564.84" dur="5.37">the authority of Messiah who is the</text>
  <text start="567.15" dur="5.18">mikkel detect High Priest so I think</text>
  <text start="570.21" dur="4.71">this is very important to understand</text>
  <text start="572.33" dur="6.01">again we have to keep in mind the words</text>
  <text start="574.92" dur="5.16">of Peter when he said that some of</text>
  <text start="578.34" dur="3.66">Apostle Paul&amp;#39;s words are hard to be</text>
  <text start="580.08" dur="3.6">understood and it&amp;#39;s very easy to just</text>
  <text start="582" dur="3.48">sort of gloss over this and say oh yeah</text>
  <text start="583.68" dur="3.54">it looks like the tour&amp;#39;s over and done</text>
  <text start="585.48" dur="3.36">with Yahshua is better than all this so</text>
  <text start="587.22" dur="3.66">we don&amp;#39;t need the Torah that&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="588.84" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s saying it&amp;#39;s just simply saying that</text>
  <text start="590.88" dur="5.16">when you&amp;#39;re talking about the priesthood</text>
  <text start="592.41" dur="5.52">which is one part of the Torah that the</text>
  <text start="596.04" dur="4.14">priesthood of mikela BEC Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="597.93" dur="5.19">superior to the priesthood of the</text>
  <text start="600.18" dur="5.01">Levites okay I hope this was clear to</text>
  <text start="603.12" dur="3.81">everyone and a blessing this is Daniel</text>
