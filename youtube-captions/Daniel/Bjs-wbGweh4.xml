  <text start="366.689" dur="3.65">trumpets has let me grab my marker here</text>
  <text start="379.569" dur="4.241">and i talked about how yom teruah the</text>
  <text start="382.189" dur="4.35">feasts of trumpets which occurred 10</text>
  <text start="383.81" dur="4.71">days ago then it&amp;#39;s all about that</text>
  <text start="386.539" dur="4.261">seventh trumpet resurrection when we get</text>
  <text start="388.52" dur="2.97">resurrected the dead and Messiah rise</text>
  <text start="390.8" dur="2.579">first</text>
  <text start="391.49" dur="3.359">and rush up into the clouds and then we</text>
  <text start="393.379" dur="3.84">who are live remain get caught up with</text>
  <text start="394.849" dur="4.051">them and we transform in a twinkling of</text>
  <text start="397.219" dur="3.391">an eye at that last trumpet and we meet</text>
  <text start="398.9" dur="4.049">yash from the air in our immortal</text>
  <text start="400.61" dur="5.04">eternal resurrected bodies and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="402.949" dur="5.34">what yom teruah that great young true a</text>
  <text start="405.65" dur="5.22">blast the last trumpet is all about and</text>

  <text start="410.87" dur="5.49">trumpets you want to Rhea and every year</text>
  <text start="413.93" dur="5.25">you have exactly 10 days between</text>
  <text start="416.36" dur="6">trumpets and yom kippur or a day of</text>
  <text start="419.18" dur="5.639">atonement 10 days now this is very</text>
  <text start="422.36" dur="5.22">significant because if you remember in</text>
  <text start="424.819" dur="4.56">Scripture you know after we get</text>
  <text start="427.58" dur="4.29">resurrected to meet Messiah which will</text>
  <text start="429.379" dur="5.431">happen on some future feasts of trumpets</text>
  <text start="431.87" dur="4.799">okay when we get resurrected Messiah you</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="3.9">know we were we meet them in the clouds</text>
  <text start="436.669" dur="3.78">and then revelation I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.71" dur="4.169">revelation 14 or 15 talks about how</text>
  <text start="440.449" dur="4.981">we&amp;#39;re standing in heaven with him and</text>
  <text start="442.879" dur="5.34">then we stand on that sea of fire and</text>
  <text start="445.43" dur="5.159">glass and Paul talks about this where</text>
  <text start="448.219" dur="3.87">you know we&amp;#39;re given our rewards we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="450.589" dur="2.911">finally given every word for what we did</text>
  <text start="452.089" dur="3.36">on earth we&amp;#39;re at the judgment seat of</text>
  <text start="453.5" dur="3.12">Christ and this is just the resurrection</text>
  <text start="455.449" dur="3.12">of the righteous the resurrection of the</text>
  <text start="456.62" dur="2.779">wicked doesn&amp;#39;t happen until after the</text>
  <text start="458.569" dur="5.07">millennial kingdom</text>
  <text start="459.399" dur="6.01">so then time we get on rewards we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="463.639" dur="3.45">standing on that sea of fire and glass</text>
  <text start="465.409" dur="3.78">and he says well done my good and</text>
  <text start="467.089" dur="4.23">faithful servant he begins to to test</text>
  <text start="469.189" dur="3.991">and try our works on earth and you know</text>
  <text start="471.319" dur="4.71">we see if we have gold or silver that</text>
  <text start="473.18" dur="4.019">you know is purified by the fire or if</text>
  <text start="476.029" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s just hey wooden stubble it gets</text>
  <text start="477.199" dur="4.53">burned up but that&amp;#39;s a and I think Paul</text>
  <text start="480.349" dur="2.641">talks about that in second Corinthians</text>
  <text start="481.729" dur="2.43">like chapter 3 or something I have to</text>
  <text start="482.99" dur="3.929">look up the reference but in any case</text>
  <text start="484.159" dur="4.26">Yom Kippur is all the the first</text>
  <text start="486.919" dur="3.081">fulfillment of Yom Kippur is when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.419" dur="4.68">standing on that sea of fire and glass</text>
  <text start="490" dur="4.569">and then of course after Yom Kippur five</text>
  <text start="493.099" dur="3">days later you have the feasts of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="494.569" dur="2.281">which is that wedding feast that I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="496.099" dur="3.241">talking about</text>
  <text start="496.85" dur="4.38">- seven-day feats and the only eight day</text>
  <text start="499.34" dur="4.35">the last great day you come out of your</text>
  <text start="501.23" dur="3.99">your suit coat your tent and and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="503.69" dur="3.06">all about the wedding supper of the lamb</text>
  <text start="505.22" dur="2.85">that we have after we get our gifts we</text>
  <text start="506.75" dur="3.69">have that wedding stuff for the lamb in</text>
  <text start="508.07" dur="5.19">heaven and then on that eight last great</text>
  <text start="510.44" dur="5.76">day is when you know we get up with our</text>
  <text start="513.26" dur="4.74">Messiah Lee&amp;#39;s saddle our horses and we</text>
  <text start="516.2" dur="3.24">head right back to earth to take over</text>
  <text start="518" dur="2.46">the earth as its talks about in</text>
  <text start="519.44" dur="3.75">Revelation 19</text>
  <text start="520.46" dur="4.44">so Yom Kippur the 1st fulfillment is</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="3.69">when we get our rewards on that sea of</text>
  <text start="524.9" dur="4.5">fire glass now the ultimate fulfillment</text>
  <text start="526.88" dur="4.83">of Yom Kippur will be after the</text>
  <text start="529.4" dur="4.14">Millennial Kingdom because remember when</text>
  <text start="531.71" dur="4.02">we went when we return with Messiah to</text>
  <text start="533.54" dur="5.16">earth okay</text>
  <text start="535.73" dur="4.83">he takes first of all he he throws the</text>
  <text start="538.7" dur="3.27">false prophet the son of perdition the</text>
  <text start="540.56" dur="3.03">beast the armies he throws him into the</text>
  <text start="541.97" dur="4.2">lake of fire they&amp;#39;re destroyed and</text>
  <text start="543.59" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re burning forever and then he</text>
  <text start="546.17" dur="4.98">takes the devil Satan who possessed the</text>
  <text start="548.96" dur="4.2">son of perdition and cast him and all of</text>
  <text start="551.15" dur="4.05">his fallen angels into the bottomless</text>
  <text start="553.16" dur="4.5">pit which is the center of the earth</text>
  <text start="555.2" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s the bottomless pit and he&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="557.66" dur="4.17">down there for a thousand years and then</text>
  <text start="559.16" dur="5.01">we in our resurrected bodies along with</text>
  <text start="561.83" dur="5.4">Messiah we rule and reign with Messiah</text>
  <text start="564.17" dur="5.31">for a thousand years and then it says in</text>
  <text start="567.23" dur="5.04">Revelation 20 at some point after the</text>
  <text start="569.48" dur="4.56">thousand years is completed the devil is</text>
  <text start="572.27" dur="3.57">released and all of his fallen angels</text>
  <text start="574.04" dur="4.2">are released from this bottomless pit</text>
  <text start="575.84" dur="4.26">and at this point all the people who</text>
  <text start="578.24" dur="3">survived the Great Tribulation that you</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="3.06">know didn&amp;#39;t take the mark of the beast</text>
  <text start="581.24" dur="3.9">but also didn&amp;#39;t make the seventh trumpet</text>
  <text start="583.16" dur="3.54">resurrection like we did they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="585.14" dur="3.75">having babies and populating the earth</text>
  <text start="586.7" dur="3.96">for a thousand years and so now the</text>
  <text start="588.89" dur="3.39">Earth&amp;#39;s population is just I mean think</text>
  <text start="590.66" dur="5.57">about he had a thousand years of no war</text>
  <text start="592.28" dur="6.48">no famine a perfect government you know</text>
  <text start="596.23" dur="4.9">no devil no war I didn&amp;#39;t feel like that</text>
  <text start="598.76" dur="3.78">so yeah a huge population of just</text>
  <text start="601.13" dur="3.96">trillions and trillions and quadrillions</text>
  <text start="602.54" dur="3.75">of people on the earth and so Satan is</text>
  <text start="605.09" dur="3.39">released and it says that he&amp;#39;s able to</text>
  <text start="606.29" dur="4.64">deceive a good good many of those people</text>
  <text start="608.48" dur="5.64">to try to stage one last rebellion</text>
  <text start="610.93" dur="5.74">against the camp of the saints against</text>
  <text start="614.12" dur="5.1">Jerusalem Yahshua and us the resurrected</text>
  <text start="616.67" dur="4.2">ones and this is to test the people that</text>
  <text start="619.22" dur="3.54">were born during the Millennial Kingdom</text>
