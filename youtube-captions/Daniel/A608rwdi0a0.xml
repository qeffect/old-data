  <text start="75.09" dur="6.569">Judah and to rebuild the temple now we</text>
  <text start="79.53" dur="7.53">have a problem here because according to</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="11.331">secular historians King Cyrus he died in</text>
  <text start="87.06" dur="10.53">the year 5 30 BC Cyrus is right here 530</text>

  <text start="112.77" dur="4.98">cyrus the great who&amp;#39;s now been dead for</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="5.58">eight years issue a decree for the</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="6.54">people of judah to return back to judah</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="5.67">from Babylon um when he&amp;#39;s been dead for</text>
  <text start="124.29" dur="5.04">eight years by the time Daniel even</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="5.91">makes a prayer to all the Almighty first</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="4.17">people to return back to Babylon the</text>
  <text start="132.33" dur="4.26">answer is the</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="5.94">Cyrus the Great is not the one who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.59" dur="5.58">mentioned in ezra chapter one and as a</text>
  <text start="139.44" dur="4.71">chapter one the next king that that</text>

  <text start="153.78" dur="5.46">now been dead for almost 50 years exact</text>
  <text start="156.959" dur="5.731">sees takes on the title of cyrus the</text>
  <text start="159.24" dur="6.499">great because by this time Cyrus his</text>
  <text start="162.69" dur="4.86">grandfather has taken almost mythical</text>
  <text start="165.739" dur="4.631">connotations in the minds of many people</text>
  <text start="167.55" dur="4.439">and a Xerxes wants to build up his name</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="4.29">and so he takes the name of Cyrus the</text>
  <text start="171.989" dur="6.72">Great so we read and as a chapter 1</text>
  <text start="174.66" dur="7.23">about Cyrus the Persian having his heart</text>
  <text start="178.709" dur="4.5">stirred up by yah to issue a decree for</text>
