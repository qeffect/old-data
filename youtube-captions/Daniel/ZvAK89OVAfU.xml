  <text start="286.19" dur="4.259">said it&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;ve entered a dream</text>
  <text start="288.31" dur="3.52">during the first few weeks of delivery</text>
  <text start="290.449" dur="3.09">driving I was learning the ropes of</text>
  <text start="291.83" dur="3.3">handling the man how to fill out the</text>
  <text start="293.539" dur="3.121">proper forms and of course using the</text>
  <text start="295.13" dur="3.93">Thomas guide to figure out where I was</text>
  <text start="296.66" dur="3.99">going each day but one morning after</text>
  <text start="299.06" dur="3.81">making a delivery in downtown Portland</text>
  <text start="300.65" dur="3.93">my dispatcher notified me that I needed</text>
  <text start="302.87" dur="3.24">to just sit and wait as they were as</text>
  <text start="304.58" dur="3.54">there were no more runs to make at the</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="3.3">moment I realized that I was parked</text>
  <text start="308.12" dur="3.18">right across from Portland State</text>
  <text start="309.41" dur="4.62">University a place I hadn&amp;#39;t visited</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="4.41">three and a half years old memories of</text>
  <text start="314.03" dur="4.05">my victories on this campus swelled up</text>
  <text start="315.71" dur="5.31">inside of me surely yaad placed me here</text>
  <text start="318.08" dur="5.04">for such a time as this stuffing my</text>
  <text start="321.02" dur="3.54">radio phone into my jacket I jumped out</text>
  <text start="323.12" dur="3.72">of the van strode into the park blocks</text>
  <text start="324.56" dur="4.289">and began preaching within minutes y&amp;#39;all</text>
  <text start="326.84" dur="4.35">help me draw a crowd of Muslims atheists</text>

  <text start="337.4" dur="3.75">radio interrupted my preaching and I</text>
  <text start="339.349" dur="3.961">jumped back into the van ready to carry</text>
  <text start="341.15" dur="4.11">out my next delivery for weeks this</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="4.859">would repeat literally allowing me to do</text>
  <text start="345.26" dur="4.68">ministry while on the job after living</text>
  <text start="348.169" dur="3.571">for about two months with Yoakam and his</text>
  <text start="349.94" dur="4.17">wife and annika only a month away from</text>

  <text start="372.74" dur="3.78">with bomb even though we said we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="374.96" dur="3.63">care that the house and property were a</text>
  <text start="376.52" dur="4.92">dream come true we just simply couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="378.59" dur="4.949">get the financing Annika&amp;#39;s grandparents</text>

  <text start="408.8" dur="4.35">to be on call in case she ran into any</text>
  <text start="410.87" dur="3.93">emergencies but after looking over</text>
