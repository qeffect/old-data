  <text start="0.77" dur="5.2">well Shalom and happy Purim I try this</text>
  <text start="3.3" dur="3.9">again I tried to record a earlier</text>
  <text start="5.97" dur="4.26">version of this and it wound up being</text>
  <text start="7.2" dur="6.39">too long so try to stick more to my time</text>
  <text start="10.23" dur="5.55">limit it is Purim Purim has begun this</text>
  <text start="13.59" dur="5.1">evening march six Tuesday evening march</text>
  <text start="15.78" dur="4.38">six 2012 as you can see the Sun has set</text>
  <text start="18.69" dur="4.47">and it is nighttime here in Portland</text>
  <text start="20.16" dur="5.039">Oregon perm has begun to debt tonight it</text>
  <text start="23.16" dur="3.66">goes through tomorrow Wednesday mark</text>
  <text start="25.199" dur="4.23">seventh and also Thursday march eight</text>
  <text start="26.82" dur="4.5">some of you may be confused because the</text>
  <text start="29.429" dur="4.141">Jewish people actually don&amp;#39;t start perm</text>
  <text start="31.32" dur="3.96">until tomorrow evening wednesday night</text>
  <text start="33.57" dur="3.36">they celebrated thursday and friday the</text>
  <text start="35.28" dur="2.88">reason they celebrated a day later is</text>
  <text start="36.93" dur="3.21">because rather than following the</text>
  <text start="38.16" dur="4.469">scriptural calendar and starting the</text>
  <text start="40.14" dur="4.89">month of adar the 12 month when the moon</text>
  <text start="42.629" dur="4.741">is completely black or the conjunctive</text>
  <text start="45.03" dur="5.88">new moon over Jerusalem they use a</text>
  <text start="47.37" dur="5.07">rabbinical pre-calculated formula to</text>
  <text start="50.91" dur="3.719">determine when their month begins and</text>
  <text start="52.44" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s completely separated from the moon</text>
  <text start="54.629" dur="5.43">itself so that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="57.09" dur="5.07">perm a day late but Purim does start</text>
  <text start="60.059" dur="3.93">tonight and you can read anything you</text>
  <text start="62.16" dur="4.35">want about the calendar I have links on</text>
  <text start="63.989" dur="3.45">that on my website but tomorrow</text>
  <text start="66.51" dur="2.88">hopefully we&amp;#39;re going to have a whole</text>
  <text start="67.439" dur="5.79">section that&amp;#39;s going to be dedicated to</text>
  <text start="69.39" dur="5.159">Purim and we&amp;#39;re gonna have articles and</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="3.091">resources that you can read about to</text>
  <text start="74.549" dur="3.121">better acquaint yourself with this</text>
  <text start="76.32" dur="3.39">holiday if you don&amp;#39;t know much about it</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="4.65">i&amp;#39;m also i wrote an article tonight</text>
  <text start="79.71" dur="3.9">about Purim and hopefully we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="82.32" dur="3.39">have it up on the web tomorrow under</text>
  <text start="83.61" dur="3.78">this section and i just explore one of</text>
  <text start="85.71" dur="3.63">the themes or a couple of the themes and</text>
  <text start="87.39" dur="4.2">perm that I think sometimes get ignored</text>
  <text start="89.34" dur="5.55">because you know Purim for those who</text>
  <text start="91.59" dur="5.069">celebrated its it&amp;#39;s a very fun</text>
  <text start="94.89" dur="4.08">celebration because everyone dresses up</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="5.011">in costumes people dress up as the</text>
  <text start="98.97" dur="4.77">arrogant evil Haman or the righteous</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="4.17">Mordecai or the humble Queen Esther or</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="3.9">the King azor heiress and they dress up</text>
  <text start="105.84" dur="4.23">and they reenact the story that&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="6.119">of fun but because of all the pageantry</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="5.82">and the costumes and the fun people can</text>
  <text start="113.759" dur="3.93">sometimes forget about some of the very</text>
  <text start="115.89" dur="3.57">important themes that are explored in</text>
  <text start="117.689" dur="3.241">perm and in the book of Esther and I</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="3.15">attempt to do that my article so I hope</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="3.689">it blesses you so we&amp;#39;ll try to have that</text>
  <text start="122.61" dur="5.7">up on the website tomorrow during the</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="5.491">first day of perm but tonight I want to</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="4.08">discuss the prophetic significance of</text>
  <text start="130.11" dur="4.8">Pern you know in Colossians chapter 2</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="4.65">the Apostle Paul said very clearly that</text>
  <text start="134.91" dur="5.22">these feast days these Hebrew feast days</text>
  <text start="137.04" dur="5.49">are shadows of things to come now we</text>
  <text start="140.13" dur="4.32">penned those words several decades after</text>
  <text start="142.53" dur="4.76">the resurrection and in fact we know</text>
  <text start="144.45" dur="6.54">that young teruah Yom Kippur and</text>
  <text start="147.29" dur="5.68">Tabernacles the fall feasts are pointing</text>
  <text start="150.99" dur="6.719">toward events that have not yet occurred</text>
  <text start="152.97" dur="6.36">yet but Hanukkah and Purim also contain</text>
  <text start="157.709" dur="4.5">prophetic elements that point toward</text>
  <text start="159.33" dur="5.01">things still yet to come and in fact one</text>
  <text start="162.209" dur="3.931">of the reasons why Daniel in the Book of</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="4.47">Daniel was unable to understand some of</text>
  <text start="166.14" dur="5.64">the dates and the things that that the</text>
  <text start="168.81" dur="5.52">angel is showing him is because the</text>
  <text start="171.78" dur="5.459">feast of both Purim and Hanukkah had not</text>
  <text start="174.33" dur="4.98">yet been instituted Purim would be</text>
  <text start="177.239" dur="4.711">instituted shortly after the time of</text>
  <text start="179.31" dur="4.86">Daniel and then of course the feast of</text>
  <text start="181.95" dur="5.819">Hanukkah would not be established for a</text>
  <text start="184.17" dur="4.86">couple of centuries later and these are</text>
  <text start="187.769" dur="2.671">two piece that are critical to</text>
  <text start="189.03" dur="3.72">understanding the timing of the events</text>
  <text start="190.44" dur="3.87">in the book of Revelation oh we have a</text>
  <text start="192.75" dur="3.239">whole section dedicated to Hanukkah and</text>
  <text start="194.31" dur="3.149">we discussed the prophetic significance</text>
  <text start="195.989" dur="3.601">of Hanukkah so you can look at that</text>
  <text start="197.459" dur="4.951">section if you&amp;#39;d like but tonight we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="199.59" dur="4.619">going to talk about Purim and you know</text>
  <text start="202.41" dur="3.299">there&amp;#39;s a lot of Nessie annex out there</text>
  <text start="204.209" dur="3.211">and Hebrew roots people who say well we</text>
  <text start="205.709" dur="3.09">shouldn&amp;#39;t celebrate Purim or Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="207.42" dur="3.96">because they&amp;#39;re not one of the seven</text>
  <text start="208.799" dur="5.521">feasts that are mentioned in Leviticus</text>
  <text start="211.38" dur="5.91">23 that&amp;#39;s true hana confirm are not</text>
  <text start="214.32" dur="5.79">mentioned leviticus 23 but i do believe</text>
  <text start="217.29" dur="4.83">Hanukkah permit just as important as the</text>
  <text start="220.11" dur="4.92">seven biblical feasts in fact ice think</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="4.44">these fees are biblical perm certainly</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="3.72">is a biblical feast because it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="4.95">Bible all you have to do is go to the</text>
  <text start="228.75" dur="5.25">book of Esther and you will see how one</text>
  <text start="231.51" dur="4.74">woman named Queen Esther submitted or</text>
  <text start="234" dur="4.61">uncle Trustin yah and Yahweh wrought</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="4.739">victory and then the Jews very rightly</text>
  <text start="238.61" dur="4.54">responded to this by creating a memorial</text>
  <text start="240.989" dur="3.601">and instituting that for two days they</text>
  <text start="243.15" dur="3.02">were going to celebrate Purim in the</text>
  <text start="244.59" dur="4.29">month of adar when these events occurred</text>
  <text start="246.17" dur="4.569">and I think it was to honor yacht so</text>
  <text start="248.88" dur="3.9">Purim is certainly a celebration we</text>
  <text start="250.739" dur="4.651">should keep it&amp;#39;s a biblical celebration</text>
  <text start="252.78" dur="4.86">we know from the Gospel of John that</text>
  <text start="255.39" dur="4.86">Yahshua kept the feast of dedication the</text>
  <text start="257.64" dur="4.349">feast of Hanukkah so of course he was</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="4.05">Jewish he of course celebrated the feast</text>
  <text start="261.989" dur="3.361">of Purim as well so we should celebrate</text>
  <text start="264.3" dur="3.54">Purim</text>
  <text start="265.35" dur="5.04">and one of the greatest reasons to</text>
  <text start="267.84" dur="5.16">celebrate perm and this is apart from</text>
  <text start="270.39" dur="4.47">the reasons I go over in my article and</text>
  <text start="273" dur="4.26">from the reasons you&amp;#39;ll hear from rabbis</text>
  <text start="274.86" dur="4.35">and messianic teachers when they talk</text>
  <text start="277.26" dur="4.23">about how perm is about victory and it</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="3.66">is it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s about victory spiritual</text>
  <text start="281.49" dur="3.81">victory it&amp;#39;s about how you can turn</text>
  <text start="282.87" dur="5.1">around very evil situations in your life</text>
  <text start="285.3" dur="5.22">and cause great good to come from them</text>
  <text start="287.97" dur="4.05">if you trust in him even if it</text>
  <text start="290.52" dur="3.33">jeopardizes your reputation or</text>
  <text start="292.02" dur="3.75">jeopardizes something precious to you if</text>
  <text start="293.85" dur="5.52">you trust in yob of all else and do what</text>
  <text start="295.77" dur="5.49">he says then even the most tragic evil</text>
  <text start="299.37" dur="4.2">situations that are in your life or are</text>
  <text start="301.26" dur="4.02">ready to spring in your life can be</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="4.65">totally turned on their head and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.28" dur="4.59">what we see in Perm if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="308.22" dur="3.48">familiar with the story firm I encourage</text>
  <text start="309.87" dur="4.83">you to read the book of Esther because</text>
  <text start="311.7" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s an amazing story about hi-yah takes</text>
  <text start="314.7" dur="4.71">a very evil situation that was basically</text>
  <text start="317.43" dur="3.3">going to lead to the complete genocide</text>
  <text start="319.41" dur="3.36">of the Jewish people in the land of</text>
  <text start="320.73" dur="4.68">Persia which was the world empire at the</text>
  <text start="322.77" dur="5.43">time and how that situation is totally</text>
  <text start="325.41" dur="5.4">flipped on its head and not only is</text>
  <text start="328.2" dur="4.56">Haman who tried to enact this plan not</text>
  <text start="330.81" dur="4.68">only is he killed on the very stake that</text>
  <text start="332.76" dur="4.83">he was going to kill Mordecai but all</text>
  <text start="335.49" dur="4.56">those who were going to follow Heyman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="337.59" dur="4.38">orders and commit genocide and slaughter</text>
  <text start="340.05" dur="4.56">the Jews they themselves were</text>
  <text start="341.97" dur="4.41">slaughtered by the Jewish people with</text>
  <text start="344.61" dur="5.58">the blessing of the king of Persia so</text>
  <text start="346.38" dur="5.58">this very very devastating tragic evil</text>
  <text start="350.19" dur="3.96">situation that was about to explode</text>
  <text start="351.96" dur="4.28">across the Empire was completely</text>
  <text start="354.15" dur="4.74">reversed and it was an amazing victory</text>
  <text start="356.24" dur="4.69">so it&amp;#39;s an awesome very inspiring story</text>
  <text start="358.89" dur="4.26">this is a season of victory this is a</text>
  <text start="360.93" dur="3.81">time when yah will take situations and</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="4.56">tragedies that you&amp;#39;ve been through or</text>
  <text start="364.74" dur="4.98">that are looming in your life and these</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="3.42">this is times when he will test your</text>
  <text start="369.72" dur="2.79">character like you tested Queen Esther</text>
  <text start="371.13" dur="3.63">and if you trust in him and you pass</text>
  <text start="372.51" dur="5.43">that test he will turn these situations</text>
  <text start="374.76" dur="4.44">around he will bless you and you can</text>
  <text start="377.94" dur="3.65">read more about that in the article that</text>
  <text start="379.2" dur="5.33">will be posted tomorrow on the website</text>
  <text start="381.59" dur="5.47">so the prophetic significance of Purim</text>
  <text start="384.53" dur="4.3">Purim has a lot to do with the</text>
  <text start="387.06" dur="3.99">Antichrist and what the rise of the</text>
  <text start="388.83" dur="4.14">Antichrist because a lot of the story of</text>
  <text start="391.05" dur="3.929">Purim is about Haman who is a very</text>
  <text start="392.97" dur="4.08">Antichrist figure he wants the Jews</text>
  <text start="394.979" dur="2.941">destroyed Mordecai refused to bow down</text>
  <text start="397.05" dur="2.76">him</text>
  <text start="397.92" dur="3.36">and so he swears that he&amp;#39;s going to use</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="3.96">his power and influence and authority</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="5.51">that he has with the King to destroy the</text>
  <text start="403.77" dur="5.4">Jews and he almost gets away with it</text>
  <text start="406.79" dur="4.24">there is a trilogy it&amp;#39;s the second</text>
  <text start="409.17" dur="6.6">trilogy of articles on my website where</text>
  <text start="411.03" dur="8.28">I talk about how in the year 2014 three</text>
  <text start="415.77" dur="5.1">days before the feast of Purim in 2014 i</text>
  <text start="419.31" dur="4.02">believe is when the Antichrist is going</text>
  <text start="420.87" dur="3.6">to rise to power now why three days we</text>
  <text start="423.33" dur="3.78">can read the article and find out but</text>
  <text start="424.47" dur="4.74">basically you know Esther when she had</text>
  <text start="427.11" dur="3.96">agreed with Mordecai to help him and to</text>
  <text start="429.21" dur="4.89">risk her own life to approach the King</text>
  <text start="431.07" dur="5.85">and try to expose Haman she first prayed</text>
  <text start="434.1" dur="5.55">and fasted for three days so just prior</text>
  <text start="436.92" dur="4.68">to that three days before purim was when</text>
  <text start="439.65" dur="4.65">Haman was sort of at the height of the</text>
  <text start="441.6" dur="4.29">zenith of his power Mordecai Nestor had</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="3.96">not entered into an agreement yet she</text>
  <text start="445.89" dur="3.87">had not fasted and prayed Heyman had not</text>
  <text start="448.26" dur="2.64">been exposed and that was when he was at</text>
  <text start="449.76" dur="4.68">the height of his power so I believe</text>
  <text start="450.9" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s going to be three days before that</text>
  <text start="454.44" dur="4.86">feast and in fact if you count three</text>
  <text start="456.57" dur="6.45">days before that feast until yom teruah</text>
  <text start="459.3" dur="5.4">2017 it&amp;#39;s exactly 1290 days which is a</text>
  <text start="463.02" dur="5.88">time period listed in the book of Daniel</text>
  <text start="464.7" dur="8">chapter 12 um excuse the sirens i live</text>
  <text start="468.9" dur="8.72">on downtown garland on subject to do</text>
  <text start="472.7" dur="6.57">anyway as I was saying so we can</text>
  <text start="477.62" dur="3.53">understand that this time period and</text>
  <text start="479.27" dur="5.4">perm usually occurs anywhere between</text>
  <text start="481.15" dur="6.19">mid-february and mid-march so late</text>
  <text start="484.67" dur="4.8">winter basically but that this time</text>
  <text start="487.34" dur="3.3">period this time of late winter is going</text>
  <text start="489.47" dur="3.6">to be the time when they enter crash</text>
  <text start="490.64" dur="4.08">rises to power so when he desecrates the</text>
  <text start="493.07" dur="3.39">temple when he commits the abomination</text>
  <text start="494.72" dur="3.42">of desolation when he rises to his power</text>
  <text start="496.46" dur="3.57">and consolidates his rule over the earth</text>
  <text start="498.14" dur="3.12">we don&amp;#39;t need to be shaken by these</text>
  <text start="500.03" dur="3.48">things because we&amp;#39;re going to know oh</text>
  <text start="501.26" dur="3.9">yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s late winter it&amp;#39;s the time</text>
  <text start="503.51" dur="3.69">of perm this is when this should happen</text>
  <text start="505.16" dur="4.05">you know this is the time when Haman</text>
  <text start="507.2" dur="3.36">rose to power and when he was about to</text>
  <text start="509.21" dur="3.66">threaten the Jews but just like with</text>
  <text start="510.56" dur="5.07">Haman the Antichrist is going to meet</text>
  <text start="512.87" dur="4.23">his end the very devastation that he</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="3.539">seeks to wreak against the Jews and</text>
  <text start="517.1" dur="4.14">against believers is ultimately going to</text>
  <text start="519.169" dur="5.671">be visited upon his head not immediately</text>
  <text start="521.24" dur="5.73">as was the case with Haman but but three</text>
  <text start="524.84" dur="4.71">and a half years later in 2017 he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="526.97" dur="4.86">meet his end so we can take her</text>
  <text start="529.55" dur="5.16">encouragement from that Purim by</text>
  <text start="531.83" dur="4.44">celebrating perm by by meditating and</text>
  <text start="534.71" dur="3.57">reflecting on the themes in the book of</text>
  <text start="536.27" dur="4.17">Esther and understanding what yaad did</text>
  <text start="538.28" dur="3.93">during this feast perm can give us a</text>
  <text start="540.44" dur="5.46">great deal of comfort and encouragement</text>
  <text start="542.21" dur="5.43">and inspiration and joy during what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.9" dur="4.05">otherwise a pretty dark period of time I</text>
  <text start="547.64" dur="3.39">mean this is late winter a lot of areas</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="2.94">especially in the north like where I</text>
  <text start="551.03" dur="5.88">live in Oregon it&amp;#39;s still very dark and</text>
  <text start="552.89" dur="6.33">gloomy and rainy and cold and so it can</text>
