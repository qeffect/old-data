  <text start="16.529" dur="4.531">the 5th of November</text>
  <text start="17.67" dur="6.51">if you&amp;#39;ve ever seen that movie guy Fox</text>
  <text start="21.06" dur="6.18">and his wicked anyway I won&amp;#39;t get into</text>

  <text start="31.26" dur="5.01">Eber month and there&amp;#39;s a major news</text>
  <text start="35.01" dur="3.51">story that happened so it looks like the</text>
  <text start="36.27" dur="4.35">ant ephah&amp;#39; communist rallies were a dud</text>
  <text start="38.52" dur="3.62">they just I there were like maybe a</text>
  <text start="40.62" dur="4.14">hundred people in Portland that</text>
  <text start="42.14" dur="4">protested and then even in New York City</text>
  <text start="44.76" dur="5.22">there was like just a couple hundred it</text>
  <text start="46.14" dur="5.22">was a dead so no civil war but something</text>
  <text start="49.98" dur="2.969">even more major happened</text>
  <text start="51.36" dur="3.66">first of all Senator Rand Paul was</text>
  <text start="52.949" dur="3.151">assaulted at his house today he</text>
  <text start="55.02" dur="4.5">shouldn&amp;#39;t have been mowing the lawn on</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="5.58">Shabbat but he was assaulted and then in</text>
  <text start="59.52" dur="4.919">Saudi Arabia there&amp;#39;s a major shake-up</text>
  <text start="61.68" dur="5.82">going on about 11 princes have been</text>
  <text start="64.439" dur="5.191">arrested all the American venant&amp;#39;s years</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="3.21">that worked in Saudi Arabia under the</text>
  <text start="69.63" dur="4.02">Bush administration they&amp;#39;ve all been</text>
  <text start="70.71" dur="4.71">fired and this happened a couple weeks</text>
  <text start="73.65" dur="5.009">ago actually for the first time the</text>
  <text start="75.42" dur="5.519">Saudi Arabia prince met with Russia and</text>
  <text start="78.659" dur="4.71">they they&amp;#39;re not friends with Russia but</text>
  <text start="80.939" dur="4.351">now they are so it looks like what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="83.369" dur="4.68">happening is China is actually pushing</text>
  <text start="85.29" dur="5.039">to buy oil from Saudi Arabia not using</text>
  <text start="88.049" dur="4.171">the American dollar but the one which</text>
  <text start="90.329" dur="3.601">makes sense I mean they you know China</text>
  <text start="92.22" dur="3.3">and Russia and and and a few other</text>
  <text start="93.93" dur="3.42">nations they formed the brick back in</text>
  <text start="95.52" dur="3.18">2011 so it makes sense that they would</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="3.3">no longer want to use the dollar that</text>
  <text start="98.7" dur="5.25">the one he&amp;#39;s the one because if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="100.65" dur="5.579">able to use the one to buy oil then that</text>
  <text start="103.95" dur="6.18">will cause the internationalization of</text>
  <text start="106.229" dur="5.131">the wan to replace the dollar so it</text>
  <text start="110.13" dur="2.73">looks like what&amp;#39;s happening is there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="111.36" dur="3.81">currency war that&amp;#39;s about to turn into a</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="3.869">hot war and i got this from a couple</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="4.799">people that I saw on YouTube in just the</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="5.85">news but Saudi Arabia is now looking to</text>
  <text start="119.969" dur="4.201">ally itself not what the United States</text>
  <text start="122.579" dur="3.061">anymore like it used to under the Bush</text>
  <text start="124.17" dur="3.269">and Obama administration but it&amp;#39;s now</text>
  <text start="125.64" dur="4.709">looking to switch sides and ally itself</text>
  <text start="127.439" dur="4.681">with Russia and China and if Saudi</text>
  <text start="130.349" dur="2.301">Arabia winds up throwing its support</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="2.86">behind</text>
  <text start="132.65" dur="6.3">Russia and China and allowing China to</text>
  <text start="134.98" dur="6.49">buy oil with the one this is gonna</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="5.25">severely weaken the dollar and so this</text>
  <text start="141.47" dur="4.62">whole thing with North Korea the United</text>
  <text start="144.2" dur="3.599">States wants a war with North Korea</text>
  <text start="146.09" dur="3.03">because they know that if if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="147.799" dur="3.36">war with North Korea the United States</text>
  <text start="149.12" dur="4.589">will have justification to have a war</text>
  <text start="151.159" dur="4.11">with China and the United States is very</text>
  <text start="153.709" dur="4.771">upset with China because China is trying</text>
  <text start="155.269" dur="5.761">to undermine the dollar by basically</text>
  <text start="158.48" dur="6.03">swaying Saudi Arabia to trade oil for</text>
  <text start="161.03" dur="5.4">the one so we&amp;#39;re seeing a major event go</text>
  <text start="164.51" dur="3.75">down today they&amp;#39;re calling it a coup in</text>
  <text start="166.43" dur="3.089">Saudi Arabia and they&amp;#39;re you know the</text>
  <text start="168.26" dur="2.339">United States is saying oh they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="169.519" dur="2.431">doing this because they&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="170.599" dur="4.621">rid of the radical elements that support</text>
  <text start="171.95" dur="4.92">Iran it&amp;#39;s really not not the case what</text>
  <text start="175.22" dur="4.439">they&amp;#39;re really doing is Saudi Arabia is</text>
  <text start="176.87" dur="5.75">firing all the American representatives</text>
  <text start="179.659" dur="5.431">and Finance ears in Saudi Arabia and</text>
  <text start="182.62" dur="4.69">switching its alliance from the United</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="4.41">States to Russia and China and Russia</text>
  <text start="187.31" dur="5.91">and China will then have the money not</text>
  <text start="189.5" dur="5.22">just the power but the money to wage the</text>
  <text start="193.22" dur="3.75">second seal which remember the second</text>
  <text start="194.72" dur="5.159">seal is red it&amp;#39;s a red horse because Red</text>
  <text start="196.97" dur="4.59">China and red communistic Russia yes</text>
  <text start="199.879" dur="3.931">Russia is still communist just like</text>
  <text start="201.56" dur="3.84">China just like North Korea now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="203.81" dur="3.389">gonna have Saudi Arabia to help them and</text>
  <text start="205.4" dur="4.32">so they&amp;#39;re gonna have the money and the</text>
  <text start="207.199" dur="5.85">power to launch a surprise attack</text>
  <text start="209.72" dur="5.699">against the United States so this is all</text>
  <text start="213.049" dur="4.53">playing into the hands of what I believe</text>
  <text start="215.419" dur="5.761">and again I could be wrong</text>
  <text start="217.579" dur="5.25">but it looks like that with this huge</text>
  <text start="221.18" dur="2.88">development I mean Saudi Arabia is</text>
  <text start="222.829" dur="2.97">switching from the United States to</text>
  <text start="224.06" dur="3.419">Russia and China and allowing China to</text>
  <text start="225.799" dur="4.19">use the one which they haven&amp;#39;t allowed</text>
  <text start="227.479" dur="5.07">it yet but it&amp;#39;s looking like it&amp;#39;s likely</text>
  <text start="229.989" dur="5.65">this is huge this is huge</text>
  <text start="232.549" dur="5.881">so the xi prince is being fired the</text>
  <text start="235.639" dur="4.111">American financier is in Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="238.43" dur="3.75">that have been there since the Bush era</text>
  <text start="239.75" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re being removed and Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="242.18" dur="3.51">is switching its alliance to Russia and</text>
  <text start="244.43" dur="6.449">China rather than the United States if</text>
  <text start="245.69" dur="6.99">this actually goes down then Russia and</text>
  <text start="250.879" dur="6.45">China will have the money from Saudi</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="6.269">Arabia and the oil to destroy America so</text>
  <text start="257.329" dur="3.77">this very well that what happened today</text>
  <text start="258.949" dur="3.871">on Shabbat very well could be another</text>
  <text start="261.099" dur="2.831">indication that the United States is</text>
  <text start="262.82" dur="2.399">going to be destroyed in the next four</text>
  <text start="263.93" dur="1.98">months which means the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="265.219" dur="2.761">will begin</text>
