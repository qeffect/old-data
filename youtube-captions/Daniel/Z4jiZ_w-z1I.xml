  <text start="7.02" dur="4.77">2018 and I&amp;#39;m going to now do a video on</text>
  <text start="9.809" dur="4.41">the history of the First Amendment then</text>
  <text start="11.79" dur="3.809">why the founding fathers birthed the</text>
  <text start="14.219" dur="4.441">First Amendment which is not reported</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="4.531">often with a lot of historians and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="18.66" dur="4.289">gonna be posting some links below this</text>
  <text start="20.13" dur="6.149">video to establish this so there was a</text>
  <text start="22.949" dur="5.82">Great Awakening the reign awakening was</text>
  <text start="26.279" dur="4.5">a religious revival that that impacted</text>
  <text start="28.769" dur="6.901">the English colonies in America during</text>
  <text start="30.779" dur="6.12">the 1730&amp;#39;s and 1740s and one of the the</text>
  <text start="35.67" dur="4.11">people involved when the Great Awakening</text>
  <text start="36.899" dur="4.5">was a man named George Whitfield and</text>
  <text start="39.78" dur="3.33">George Whitfield with who was a minister</text>
  <text start="41.399" dur="3.331">actually from Britain he had a</text>
  <text start="43.11" dur="4.379">significant impact during the Great</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="4.739">Awakening Woodfill toward the colonies</text>
  <text start="47.489" dur="3.901">the American colonies up and down the</text>
  <text start="49.469" dur="5.881">Atlantic coast preaching his message in</text>
  <text start="51.39" dur="6.509">one year Whitfield covered 5,000 miles</text>
  <text start="55.35" dur="5.009">in America and preached more than 350</text>
  <text start="57.899" dur="4.381">times and he did this in the open air he</text>
  <text start="60.359" dur="4.101">would gather huge crowds his style is</text>
  <text start="62.28" dur="4.53">very charismatic theatrical expressive</text>
  <text start="64.46" dur="4.089">in fact he was known to have a golden</text>
  <text start="66.81" dur="3.39">tongue and it would bring many many</text>
  <text start="68.549" dur="3.57">people to repentance we&amp;#39;re talking true</text>
  <text start="70.2" dur="5.04">Jain and repentance or they&amp;#39;d be down on</text>
  <text start="72.119" dur="5.761">their faces and this continued through</text>
  <text start="75.24" dur="6.239">the 1730&amp;#39;s and 1740s and so by the time</text>
  <text start="77.88" dur="6.059">you get to the 1770s and the time of the</text>
  <text start="81.479" dur="4.351">American Revolution to the 1780s the</text>
  <text start="83.939" dur="3.75">founding fathers who most of them were</text>
  <text start="85.83" dur="3.57">deists okay they were not actually</text>
  <text start="87.689" dur="3.481">believers in Messiah they sort of</text>
  <text start="89.4" dur="3.21">believe that yah was distant some of</text>
  <text start="91.17" dur="4.05">them were but most of them were not and</text>
  <text start="92.61" dur="4.77">yet they understood the value of what</text>
  <text start="95.22" dur="4.62">George Whitfield had done in previous</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="4.199">decades and and the impact that it had</text>
  <text start="99.84" dur="4.68">amongst the American colonies in terms</text>
  <text start="101.579" dur="5.101">of bringing people to a place where they</text>
  <text start="104.52" dur="5.79">were completely relying on the Messiah</text>
  <text start="106.68" dur="5.43">and so they basically decided that they</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="3.989">wanted to pass this first amendment in</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="4.219">order to protect open-air stripper</text>
  <text start="114.299" dur="4.051">street preachers like George Whitfield</text>
  <text start="116.329" dur="4.711">now you have to understand that in</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="5.97">England at the time even way back then</text>
  <text start="121.04" dur="5.74">because of how much the state and church</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="5.159">were working together and persecuting</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="4.57">the true Saints that open-air preaching</text>
  <text start="129.479" dur="3.641">really was not allowed now it</text>
  <text start="131.35" dur="4.02">did happen in certain areas like whales</text>
  <text start="133.12" dur="4.11">and other but but in London and in</text>
  <text start="135.37" dur="2.88">England there was a lot of oppression</text>
  <text start="137.23" dur="4.2">against that which is why many people</text>
  <text start="138.25" dur="5.1">moved to the new world right the</text>
  <text start="141.43" dur="3.39">American colonies so the founding</text>
  <text start="143.35" dur="3.75">fathers even though most of them were</text>
  <text start="144.82" dur="5.25">deists they knew enough and understood</text>
  <text start="147.1" dur="4.53">enough of what George Whitefield had</text>
  <text start="150.07" dur="3.33">done and how his street preaching and</text>
  <text start="151.63" dur="3.36">wonder about his spirit had impact of</text>
  <text start="153.4" dur="4.38">the culture and the American colony so</text>
  <text start="154.99" dur="4.86">much that they offered this first</text>
  <text start="157.78" dur="4.11">amendment and it was primarily to</text>
  <text start="159.85" dur="4.2">protect open-air Street Preachers</text>
  <text start="161.89" dur="4.29">now I&amp;#39;m making this video because so</text>
  <text start="164.05" dur="4.41">many people say well Daniel yeah we want</text>
  <text start="166.18" dur="3.81">you to expose the Satanic pedophiles we</text>
  <text start="168.46" dur="3.57">want you to do the investigative</text>
  <text start="169.99" dur="4.44">reporting we want you to do interviews</text>
  <text start="172.03" dur="4.65">of satanic ritual abuse survivors but</text>
  <text start="174.43" dur="3.63">man can you lay off the street preaching</text>
  <text start="176.68" dur="2.73">I mean you&amp;#39;re doing all this street</text>
  <text start="178.06" dur="3.81">preaching and you&amp;#39;re doing a full time</text>
  <text start="179.41" dur="5.09">now street preaching open-air street</text>
  <text start="181.87" dur="5.82">preaching is an absolutely critical</text>
  <text start="184.5" dur="5.17">component in terms of bringing about a</text>
  <text start="187.69" dur="3.45">Great Awakening or revival it is only</text>
  <text start="189.67" dur="3.69">through true repentance in fact we were</text>
  <text start="191.14" dur="4.77">talking about this in our zoom crater</text>
  <text start="193.36" dur="4.53">meeting last night it is only through</text>
  <text start="195.91" dur="4.59">true true heartfelt repentance and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="197.89" dur="4.11">not talking about that crazy revival</text>
  <text start="200.5" dur="3.48">so-called revival that happened in</text>
  <text start="202" dur="3.06">Toronto back in the 90s where there</text>
  <text start="203.98" dur="2.91">wriggled and around on the floor and</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="4.35">barking like dogs winking like it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.89" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s counterfeit that&amp;#39;s satanic I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="209.41" dur="4.02">talking about true genuine revival</text>
  <text start="211.24" dur="4.04">people are falling on their faces crying</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="4.32">out repentance there were whole towns</text>
  <text start="215.28" dur="3.85">that were shut down during the first</text>
  <text start="217.75" dur="3.17">awakening and even the second great</text>
  <text start="219.13" dur="4.17">awakening that happened in the 1800s</text>
  <text start="220.92" dur="4.06">because there was such a spirit of</text>
  <text start="223.3" dur="5.19">revival and repentance that gripped</text>
  <text start="224.98" dur="5.52">these cities and towns and really that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.49" dur="5.19">kind of what we need I mean to cut</text>
  <text start="230.5" dur="5.76">through and destroy satanic pedophilia</text>
  <text start="233.68" dur="5.07">ISM at at its root that&amp;#39;s what we need</text>
  <text start="236.26" dur="4.89">now if you have not seen my video which</text>
  <text start="238.75" dur="6.81">is called prophecy pedophiles Trump x</text>
  <text start="241.15" dur="7.11">marks the spot I kind of show that we</text>
  <text start="245.56" dur="4.38">have this time right now under President</text>
  <text start="248.26" dur="4.92">Trump in which we have this opportunity</text>
  <text start="249.94" dur="5.49">to really preach the gospel to really</text>
  <text start="253.18" dur="3.97">expose these satanic pedophiles to</text>
  <text start="255.43" dur="4.839">really go forward as much as we can</text>
  <text start="257.15" dur="5.64">in this sort of final harvest before the</text>
  <text start="260.269" dur="4.801">great simulation so go watch that video</text>
  <text start="262.79" dur="4.47">if you haven&amp;#39;t seen it but this is</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="4.08">something that again is not typically</text>
  <text start="267.26" dur="4.14">talked about there&amp;#39;s a great book by</text>
  <text start="269.15" dur="4.62">Peter Marshall called I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.4" dur="4.17">called the glory that up real quick</text>
  <text start="273.77" dur="6.39">Peter Marshall wrote this book</text>
  <text start="275.57" dur="11.94">discussing a lot of the the Peter</text>
  <text start="280.16" dur="9.62">Marshall like a pedia he wrote a book of</text>
  <text start="287.51" dur="7.469">course they don&amp;#39;t they just they just</text>
  <text start="289.78" dur="6.94">show his films I&amp;#39;m not his maybe it was</text>
  <text start="294.979" dur="7.741">his son Peter Marshall but anyway he</text>
  <text start="296.72" dur="7.949">wrote a book the power in the glory I</text>
  <text start="302.72" dur="3.66">believe anyway it was it was it was</text>
  <text start="304.669" dur="5.22">about the history of the United States</text>
  <text start="306.38" dur="6.75">and about the earlie both colonial and</text>
  <text start="309.889" dur="4.56">pre-colonial time you know again I</text>
  <text start="313.13" dur="2.7">people don&amp;#39;t realize and I mentioned</text>
  <text start="314.449" dur="3.121">this yesterday in my origins of</text>
  <text start="315.83" dur="3.899">Thanksgiving video that the pilgrims</text>
  <text start="317.57" dur="4.11">they were actually keeping the feast of</text>
  <text start="319.729" dur="4.051">Sukkot Tabernacles with the Native</text>
  <text start="321.68" dur="4.109">Americans when they came over back in</text>
  <text start="323.78" dur="3.69">the 1600s and a lot of people also don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="325.789" dur="4.411">realize that like in the Massachusetts</text>
  <text start="327.47" dur="5.19">Bay Colony the Puritans had had outlawed</text>
  <text start="330.2" dur="4.17">Christmas okay they&amp;#39;ve made that whole</text>
  <text start="332.66" dur="4.65">celebration illegal because they knew</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="5.609">about Jeremiah 10 one through six they</text>
  <text start="337.31" dur="4.109">understood about the paganism of</text>
  <text start="339.979" dur="4.37">Christmas and that it has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="341.419" dur="5.25">with Messiah in fact George Washington</text>
  <text start="344.349" dur="4.75">even though by the time you get to the</text>
  <text start="346.669" dur="4.321">late 1700s Christmas was no longer</text>
  <text start="349.099" dur="3.63">illegal most of the American culture</text>
  <text start="350.99" dur="4.2">were not celebrating Christmas at that</text>
  <text start="352.729" dur="4.801">time and George Washington actually won</text>
  <text start="355.19" dur="4.8">a decisive battle in the American</text>
  <text start="357.53" dur="4.29">Revolution because on Christmas Eve when</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="3.63">all these British shoulders were having</text>
  <text start="361.82" dur="4.469">this drunken orgy celebrating the feast</text>
  <text start="363.62" dur="4.59">of Saturnalia Christmas he launched a</text>
  <text start="366.289" dur="3.331">surprise attack and won a key victory</text>
  <text start="368.21" dur="3.6">that literally turned the tide of the</text>
  <text start="369.62" dur="3.63">Revolutionary War all because George</text>
  <text start="371.81" dur="2.94">Washington is soldiers they were not</text>
  <text start="373.25" dur="4.38">keeping Christmas it wasn&amp;#39;t in their</text>
  <text start="374.75" dur="4.38">mindset because of the Puritans and</text>
  <text start="377.63" dur="4.469">pilgrims who had embedded this in the</text>
  <text start="379.13" dur="4.289">culture at that time so they had nothing</text>
  <text start="382.099" dur="3.69">to do with this pagan stuff they were</text>
  <text start="383.419" dur="4.021">trying to actually do the Torah out of a</text>
  <text start="385.789" dur="2.021">love for the Messiah of Jesus and it was</text>
  <text start="387.44" dur="2.65">in bed</text>
  <text start="387.81" dur="3.84">in our culture in many many ways people</text>
  <text start="390.09" dur="3.72">talk about the Illuminati and the</text>
  <text start="391.65" dur="4.17">satanic ritual abuse and stuff that went</text>
  <text start="393.81" dur="5.1">back to the 1700s but let&amp;#39;s go back to</text>
  <text start="395.82" dur="4.74">the 1600s even before that when there</text>
  <text start="398.91" dur="3.479">was Pilgrims and Puritans who were</text>
  <text start="400.56" dur="3.359">really seeking to obey the Torah as much</text>
  <text start="402.389" dur="4.801">as possible out of a love for Messiah</text>
  <text start="403.919" dur="5.641">the Puritans have gotten a bad rap our</text>
  <text start="407.19" dur="3.57">secular and public universities don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="409.56" dur="2.28">portray the Puritans the way they</text>
  <text start="410.76" dur="3.21">actually where they portray them as</text>
  <text start="411.84" dur="3.78">diseased mean Stern horrible people and</text>
  <text start="413.97" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s not the case if you actually do</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="3.299">real history so Peter Marshall I think</text>
  <text start="417.72" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s called the light in the glory I</text>
  <text start="418.919" dur="4.921">apologize for not it should pop up right</text>
  <text start="422.25" dur="4.26">when I pop in his name but of course you</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="4.92">know Google is Google doesn&amp;#39;t let me do</text>
  <text start="426.51" dur="3.659">that they try to hide things but anyway</text>
  <text start="428.76" dur="2.64">I think it&amp;#39;s the light in the glory it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.169" dur="3.121">what it&amp;#39;s called it&amp;#39;s an excellent book</text>
  <text start="431.4" dur="3.329">and an excellent resource again I know</text>
  <text start="433.29" dur="3.15">the founding fathers many of them were</text>
  <text start="434.729" dur="4.291">not actual believers they were deists</text>
  <text start="436.44" dur="3.84">but they were impacted enough by the</text>
  <text start="439.02" dur="3.75">culture of that first Great Awakening</text>
  <text start="440.28" dur="5.19">George Whitefield for example and others</text>
  <text start="442.77" dur="4.56">John Wesley would be another one these</text>
  <text start="445.47" dur="4.8">men would do open-air street preaching</text>
  <text start="447.33" dur="4.89">and the First Amendment was author to</text>
  <text start="450.27" dur="4.649">protect people like that because the</text>
  <text start="452.22" dur="4.44">founding fathers understood the value of</text>
  <text start="454.919" dur="4.111">it going forth and I believe President</text>
  <text start="456.66" dur="4.62">Trump you know in that Secret Service</text>
  <text start="459.03" dur="3">agent came up to me and said that Trump</text>
  <text start="461.28" dur="2.82">had heard me</text>
  <text start="462.03" dur="4.05">I believe he understands the value of</text>
  <text start="464.1" dur="4.05">this as well and and I can guarantee you</text>
  <text start="466.08" dur="4.11">he was encouraged that day and hopefully</text>
  <text start="468.15" dur="3.36">he&amp;#39;s being encouraged by you know I</text>
  <text start="470.19" dur="3.39">don&amp;#39;t know if he&amp;#39;s paying attention I</text>
  <text start="471.51" dur="3.44">know he&amp;#39;s very busy but if he has heard</text>
  <text start="473.58" dur="3.899">that I&amp;#39;m out here in California</text>
  <text start="474.95" dur="3.73">appreciate UCLA and it&amp;#39;s not just me</text>
  <text start="477.479" dur="3.241">folks there&amp;#39;s a lot you know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="478.68" dur="3.359">guy named Paul Nisan he&amp;#39;s out I think in</text>
  <text start="480.72" dur="3.63">Florida he does open-air street</text>
  <text start="482.039" dur="4.411">preaching mean he&amp;#39;s a messianic list of</text>
  <text start="484.35" dur="4.2">Torah there are others too in fact I</text>
  <text start="486.45" dur="4.89">have a goal of wanting to actually start</text>
  <text start="488.55" dur="4.26">a college up in Juneau where for the</text>
  <text start="491.34" dur="3">summer time I would train street</text>
  <text start="492.81" dur="3.87">preachers to not only know how to street</text>
  <text start="494.34" dur="4.049">for each but also you know learn how to</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="4.799">operate in the gifts of the Spirit and</text>
  <text start="498.389" dur="5.011">and and learn the Torah learn these</text>
  <text start="501.479" dur="3.331">things of course some of the stuff can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="503.4" dur="3.12">be taught you&amp;#39;ve got to have an intimate</text>
  <text start="504.81" dur="3.359">relation of Messiah but have a college</text>
  <text start="506.52" dur="2.91">structured of that during the summer and</text>
  <text start="508.169" dur="2.161">then release street preachers out in the</text>
