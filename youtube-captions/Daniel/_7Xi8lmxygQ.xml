  <text start="1.7" dur="4.72">okay so long everybody I have Kurt</text>
  <text start="4.38" dur="4.799">Pendergrass here today some of you may</text>
  <text start="6.42" dur="4.86">know who he is especially if you went to</text>
  <text start="9.179" dur="4.92">watch his presentation yesterday on the</text>
  <text start="11.28" dur="5.79">field report I talked about it in my</text>
  <text start="14.099" dur="5.071">morning video today he did an excellent</text>
  <text start="17.07" dur="4.23">job just totally eviscerating this</text>
  <text start="19.17" dur="4.74">fraudulent warrant that&amp;#39;s been foisted</text>
  <text start="21.3" dur="5.16">upon bill McConnell where they have as</text>
  <text start="23.91" dur="4.8">Kirk has explained illegally kidnapped</text>
  <text start="26.46" dur="3.93">him I mean they put him in this jail in</text>
  <text start="28.71" dur="3.9">plum City Wisconsin but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="30.39" dur="4.38">completely fraudulent and legal and Kirk</text>
  <text start="32.61" dur="3.87">did an incredible job explaining that</text>
  <text start="34.77" dur="3.39">and so I asked him to come on to my show</text>
  <text start="36.48" dur="3.72">so I could ask him some follow-up</text>
  <text start="38.16" dur="3.809">questions on that and and also get him</text>
  <text start="40.2" dur="4.08">to explain things just real quickly</text>
  <text start="41.969" dur="4.32">though before I introduced Kirk I just</text>
  <text start="44.28" dur="4.619">want to I want to address something real</text>
  <text start="46.289" dur="5.281">quickly there&amp;#39;s a video going around of</text>
  <text start="48.899" dur="4.741">me several years ago preaching at</text>
  <text start="51.57" dur="3.509">Portland State University where I said</text>
  <text start="53.64" dur="3.509">some negative comments about President</text>
  <text start="55.079" dur="4.111">Trump and so now everybody&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="57.149" dur="4.05">I&amp;#39;m a shell and that I don&amp;#39;t really love</text>
  <text start="59.19" dur="4.68">Trump and all this stuff I just want to</text>
  <text start="61.199" dur="6.061">let people know I worked for the Trump</text>
  <text start="63.87" dur="5.94">campaign in Oregon I voted for Trump and</text>
  <text start="67.26" dur="4.89">then early in his administration I got</text>
  <text start="69.81" dur="4.05">sucked in by the media because I thought</text>
  <text start="72.15" dur="5.07">he was gonna start World War 3 with</text>
  <text start="73.86" dur="5.07">North Korea okay III did get deceived I</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="4.59">thought that was what was gonna happen</text>
  <text start="78.93" dur="5.31">and I was very upset okay that does not</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="5.22">mean I hate Trump it just means I was</text>
  <text start="84.24" dur="5.94">deceived and then when I found out about</text>
  <text start="87.03" dur="4.89">him exposing the Satanic pedophiles and</text>
  <text start="90.18" dur="3.24">going against human traffickers then I</text>
  <text start="91.92" dur="3.809">sort of came back into the fold</text>
  <text start="93.42" dur="3.659">so I never hated Trump or anything like</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="3.631">that and I just wanted to address that</text>
  <text start="97.079" dur="4.261">before I go forward because that video</text>
  <text start="99.36" dur="3.66">is being posted all over the place all</text>
  <text start="101.34" dur="4.169">right so without further ado Kirk if you</text>
  <text start="103.02" dur="4.889">could just briefly sort of as best you</text>
  <text start="105.509" dur="4.14">can summarize kind of the main points of</text>
  <text start="107.909" dur="7.46">what you covered yesterday in your</text>
  <text start="109.649" dur="8.521">presentation on the field report well</text>
  <text start="115.369" dur="5.621">the main point really here is is the</text>
  <text start="118.17" dur="5.28">fact that the initial cause of action is</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="8.909">not has never been substantiated</text>
  <text start="123.45" dur="9.899">and the protection order that KP out of</text>
  <text start="129.899" dur="8.1">Florida got was through a family court</text>
  <text start="133.349" dur="7.14">okay so the ultimate question is in the</text>
  <text start="137.999" dur="5.431">very beginning of all this how does one</text>
  <text start="140.489" dur="6.9">claim a right to a cause of action in a</text>
  <text start="143.43" dur="8.279">family court using a family form family</text>
  <text start="147.389" dur="6">court form under family law when there</text>
  <text start="151.709" dur="5.4">is no marriage contract there is no</text>
  <text start="153.389" dur="7.981">familial relationship and you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="157.109" dur="6.6">different state so at the root of all</text>
  <text start="161.37" dur="3.239">this this is this is the fraud upon the</text>
  <text start="163.709" dur="3.81">court</text>
  <text start="164.609" dur="4.8">not just fraud but fraud upon the court</text>
  <text start="167.519" dur="4.95">which has to deal with the judicial</text>
  <text start="169.409" dur="5.461">machinery itself and when we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="172.469" dur="5.67">about the the process that was used</text>
  <text start="174.87" dur="6.69">which is something that we Andy Claus</text>
  <text start="178.139" dur="6.421">have been attacking for a well over a</text>
  <text start="181.56" dur="6.03">year now which President Trump actually</text>
  <text start="184.56" dur="7.95">came out I believe it was October or</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="6.69">November of 18 and was talking about the</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="3.27">violence against women act in these</text>
  <text start="194.28" dur="3.78">protection orders and how he was</text>
  <text start="195.78" dur="4.679">changing things and there was a big</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="5.039">uproar about that because oh man he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.459" dur="5.131">setting us back hundreds of years in</text>
  <text start="203.099" dur="4.14">bubble up dome the thing is is it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="205.59" dur="3.329">even lawful to begin with and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="207.239" dur="3.42">already done the research on this we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="208.919" dur="7.59">already exposed this we&amp;#39;ve already sent</text>
  <text start="210.659" dur="7.44">it to Congress so the problem is is you</text>
  <text start="216.509" dur="5.01">know the Constitution specifically</text>
  <text start="218.099" dur="5.76">states in article 4 section 4 domestic</text>
  <text start="221.519" dur="4.131">violence is internal insurrection an</text>
  <text start="223.859" dur="5.671">attempt to overthrow the government</text>
  <text start="225.65" dur="7.449">so does Congress have the authority to</text>
  <text start="229.53" dur="6.239">alter the fundamental law and redefine</text>
  <text start="233.099" dur="5.61">what our founders put in there and wrote</text>
  <text start="235.769" dur="6.45">what domestic violence really is and the</text>
  <text start="238.709" dur="6.661">ultimate answer is no that that power</text>
  <text start="242.219" dur="6.6">doesn&amp;#39;t exist and in fact we go back to</text>
  <text start="245.37" dur="7.769">the law of nations you know written by</text>
  <text start="248.819" dur="7.831">Mr D Patel and this this this is a very</text>
  <text start="253.139" dur="7.44">usable document and it&amp;#39;s actually three</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="5.91">different books and in book 1 section 34</text>
  <text start="260.579" dur="4.95">the question has already been asked and</text>
  <text start="262.56" dur="4.68">answered does Congress have the</text>
  <text start="265.529" dur="4.911">authority to alter the fundamental law</text>
  <text start="267.24" dur="6.09">or the Constitution and the answer is no</text>
  <text start="270.44" dur="6.009">obviously I mean that&amp;#39;s just common</text>
  <text start="273.33" dur="6.059">sense in in our minds over here a tea</text>
  <text start="276.449" dur="4.59">cloth so you know with with what we do</text>
  <text start="279.389" dur="4.081">and we&amp;#39;re exposing this and Trump</text>
  <text start="281.039" dur="4.921">basically come out said look this is</text>
  <text start="283.47" dur="5.91">gonna have to have actual acts of</text>
  <text start="285.96" dur="6.69">violence in order to even begin to get</text>
  <text start="289.38" dur="4.59">this protection work now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="292.65" dur="6.449">actually talking about here is actual</text>
  <text start="293.97" dur="7.41">acts of violence not not like oh gosh</text>
  <text start="299.099" dur="4.831">I&amp;#39;m gonna kill you you know like you</text>
  <text start="301.38" dur="5.34">scream and yell at your your your kid</text>
  <text start="303.93" dur="4.44">when they spill kool-aid or grape juice</text>
  <text start="306.72" dur="2.97">on the floor oh my gosh I&amp;#39;m gonna kill</text>
  <text start="308.37" dur="2.37">you it well does that really mean that</text>
  <text start="309.69" dur="5.099">you&amp;#39;re gonna kill somebody</text>
  <text start="310.74" dur="6.06">no really doesn&amp;#39;t okay actual you know</text>
  <text start="314.789" dur="4.461">and this is the part people are having a</text>
  <text start="316.8" dur="4.44">hard time with with with what Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.25" dur="4.599">reorganizing things and getting things</text>
  <text start="321.24" dur="4.019">back into II does your form of</text>
  <text start="323.849" dur="7.29">government cuz that&amp;#39;s actually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.259" dur="8.28">happening so basically from the</text>
  <text start="331.139" dur="5.671">inception of all this it&amp;#39;s all fraud</text>
  <text start="333.539" dur="5.88">upon the court itself coupled with a you</text>
  <text start="336.81" dur="6.03">know perjury multiple other crimes and</text>
  <text start="339.419" dur="5.161">then we get into conspiring because all</text>

  <text start="524.099" dur="5.281">saying that this goes much deeper you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="526.35" dur="5.31">saying that domestic violence as defined</text>
  <text start="529.38" dur="4.199">in the Constitution has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="531.66" dur="3.119">with a husband beating his wife or a</text>

  <text start="542.55" dur="5.459">this this is so you know this this is</text>
  <text start="545.67" dur="4.31">how we do things we show the law behind</text>
  <text start="548.009" dur="3.961">it we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t just make</text>
  <text start="549.98" dur="7.479">statements and then don&amp;#39;t back it up</text>
  <text start="551.97" dur="8.779">with evidence so I use law Cornell ddu</text>
  <text start="557.459" dur="6.06">and this is a very very very good</text>
  <text start="560.749" dur="4.991">resource because when you talk about</text>
  <text start="563.519" dur="5.161">going in to see explanation it takes you</text>
  <text start="565.74" dur="5.759">to the annotated Constitution okay so</text>
  <text start="568.68" dur="6.149">you can learn about what&amp;#39;s really behind</text>
  <text start="571.499" dur="5.76">all of these sections by going to the C</text>
  <text start="574.829" dur="5.19">explanation so when we go down here to</text>
  <text start="577.259" dur="5.49">article four section four guarantees to</text>
  <text start="580.019" dur="5.401">the states see explanation we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="582.749" dur="4.351">see that article four section four</text>
  <text start="585.42" dur="7.529">guarantees a republican form of</text>
  <text start="587.1" dur="8.82">government okay and this is where we get</text>
  <text start="592.949" dur="5.221">into what it says right the first Clause</text>
  <text start="595.92" dur="4.139">of this section is in somewhat different</text>
  <text start="598.17" dur="3.69">language was contained in the Virginia</text>
  <text start="600.059" dur="4.07">Plan introduced into the convention and</text>
  <text start="601.86" dur="4.89">was obviously attributed to Madison</text>
  <text start="604.129" dur="5.741">through the various permeations into</text>
  <text start="606.75" dur="5.37">this final form the object of the Clause</text>
  <text start="609.87" dur="4.019">seems clearly to have been more than an</text>
  <text start="612.12" dur="4.319">authorization for the federal government</text>
  <text start="613.889" dur="9.39">to protect States against foreign</text>
  <text start="616.439" dur="9.811">invasion or internal insurrection okay</text>
  <text start="623.279" dur="4.92">now let&amp;#39;s back up here and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="626.25" dur="8.93">actually go read what article 4 section</text>
  <text start="628.199" dur="8.751">4 says as it is written I hate when</text>
  <text start="635.18" dur="6.57">does this it jumps it doesn&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="636.95" dur="8.22">take you right to it it&amp;#39;s so weird it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="641.75" dur="5.49">a glitch in the matrix yeah so here</text>

  <text start="666.74" dur="9.14">here in a second and president Trump but</text>
  <text start="671.78" dur="7.53">it says and upon application of the</text>
  <text start="675.88" dur="5.83">legislature now in our in our form of</text>
  <text start="679.31" dur="5.01">government Republican form we have three</text>

  <text start="699.08" dur="6.6">in a monarch that is a very clear</text>
  <text start="701.81" dur="5.52">distinction in ideology of our form of</text>
  <text start="705.68" dur="4.14">government the differences in the forms</text>
  <text start="707.33" dur="4.59">of government so this is why we have to</text>
  <text start="709.82" dur="6.03">understand a republican form of</text>
  <text start="711.92" dur="9.71">government is not a monarch and then we</text>
  <text start="715.85" dur="10.2">have Islam Islam has five pillars of law</text>
  <text start="721.63" dur="7.33">okay so that&amp;#39;s a totally separate and</text>

  <text start="728.96" dur="5.49">government each one of those is a</text>
  <text start="731.72" dur="6.21">different style and form of government</text>
  <text start="734.45" dur="5.58">so comprehending what this is actually</text>
  <text start="737.93" dur="4.11">staying right here as it is written in</text>
  <text start="740.03" dur="5.82">the Constitution and what our founders</text>
  <text start="742.04" dur="7.92">meant what they wrote here is it has to</text>
  <text start="745.85" dur="5.91">do with invasion and on application of</text>
  <text start="749.96" dur="4.77">the legislature or the executive which</text>
  <text start="751.76" dur="5.49">means that&amp;#39;s the president when the</text>
  <text start="754.73" dur="5.79">legislature cannot be convened against</text>
  <text start="757.25" dur="4.83">there it is domestic violence I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="760.52" dur="3.39">write this that&amp;#39;s just what it says as</text>
  <text start="762.08" dur="6.03">it is written now we&amp;#39;re going to go back</text>
  <text start="763.91" dur="6.72">and finish on the annotated Constitution</text>
  <text start="768.11" dur="9.36">and put the two and two together of what</text>
  <text start="770.63" dur="10.139">it actually means so foreign invasion</text>
  <text start="777.47" dur="6.08">there&amp;#39;s your invasion and here&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="780.769" dur="4.981">domestic violence internal insurrection</text>
  <text start="783.55" dur="3.279">and if you want to go look up what</text>
  <text start="785.75" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re talking about what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="786.829" dur="4.831">referencing it&amp;#39;s right here footnote 335</text>
  <text start="789.41" dur="6.53">and going all the way down here you go</text>
  <text start="791.66" dur="7.169">to 335 here it is and this will tell you</text>
  <text start="795.94" dur="6.79">see where this information comes from</text>
  <text start="798.829" dur="6.121">this is done in 1972 so this isn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="802.73" dur="6">long ago right</text>
  <text start="804.95" dur="7.62">I mean crap I was born in 1971 so you</text>
  <text start="808.73" dur="7.74">know 48 years 47 years ago this was</text>
  <text start="812.57" dur="5.639">addressed so not that long ago but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="816.47" dur="4.53">let&amp;#39;s look at what it finished reading</text>
  <text start="818.209" dur="5.13">what it says here in some of the Supreme</text>
  <text start="821" dur="4.32">Court&amp;#39;s which we&amp;#39;ll get to a power</text>
  <text start="823.339" dur="3.261">seemingly already conferred in any case</text>
  <text start="825.32" dur="5.63">okay</text>
  <text start="826.6" dur="7.63">Luther versus Borden this was in 18-49</text>
  <text start="830.95" dur="4.99">the Supreme Court established the</text>
  <text start="834.23" dur="4.979">doctrine so we have a doctrine that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="835.94" dur="5.209">been established in 1849 that questions</text>
  <text start="839.209" dur="7.351">arising under the section are what</text>
  <text start="841.149" dur="7.81">political not judicial because again it</text>
  <text start="846.56" dur="4.29">says legislature and that the</text>
  <text start="848.959" dur="4.111">legislature can&amp;#39;t be convened the</text>
  <text start="850.85" dur="6.66">executive the traditional branch</text>
  <text start="853.07" dur="8.1">actually has what is called no subject</text>
  <text start="857.51" dur="6.78">matter jurisdiction it&amp;#39;s not there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="861.17" dur="7.02">jurisdiction there so you don&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="864.29" dur="5.88">judicial branch has no authority like</text>
  <text start="868.19" dur="4.62">what we&amp;#39;re dealing with here is it says</text>
  <text start="870.17" dur="4.52">at the bottom of the form supreme fat a</text>
  <text start="872.81" dur="7.589">supreme court florida supreme court</text>
  <text start="874.69" dur="8.079">family law approved document court</text>
  <text start="880.399" dur="3.841">document ok the judicial branch doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="882.769" dur="2.43">have subject matter jurisdiction over</text>
  <text start="884.24" dur="3.57">domestic violence</text>
  <text start="885.199" dur="5.191">therefore the document itself is void</text>
  <text start="887.81" dur="4.92">from its inception that&amp;#39;s fraud upon the</text>
  <text start="890.39" dur="5.55">court that&amp;#39;s fraud upon the judicial</text>
  <text start="892.73" dur="5.13">machinery because the the judicial</text>
  <text start="895.94" dur="3.11">branch itself has said oh we&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="897.86" dur="4.03">this document</text>
  <text start="899.05" dur="6.479">and we&amp;#39;re gonna allow people to use this</text>
  <text start="901.89" dur="6.85">know that that process doesn&amp;#39;t exist and</text>
  <text start="905.529" dur="5.641">again to judicial clearly right here as</text>
  <text start="908.74" dur="5.88">it stated and has already been argued in</text>
  <text start="911.17" dur="5.4">Supreme Court back in 1849 that this is</text>
  <text start="914.62" dur="5.52">a political argument not a traditional</text>
  <text start="916.57" dur="6.36">one in character and then it rests with</text>
  <text start="920.14" dur="5.67">Congress to decide what government is</text>
  <text start="922.93" dur="4.76">established in established one in a</text>
  <text start="925.81" dur="5.61">state as well as its Republican</text>
  <text start="927.69" dur="8.589">character now in the Marine Corps you</text>
  <text start="931.42" dur="9.06">know we take the oath that says I pledge</text>
  <text start="936.279" dur="7.201">my allegiance to support the</text>
  <text start="940.48" dur="7.08">Constitution and to defend against</text>
  <text start="943.48" dur="5.88">foreign and domestic enemies domestic</text>
  <text start="947.56" dur="4.98">enemies has to deal with internal</text>
  <text start="949.36" dur="4.979">insurrection so what the example I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="952.54" dur="3.44">giving right now is that is internal</text>
  <text start="954.339" dur="4.831">insurrection the judicial branch</text>
  <text start="955.98" dur="6.76">creating this document and creating this</text>
  <text start="959.17" dur="5.88">process to deprive a fundamental right</text>
  <text start="962.74" dur="4.32">such as a parental right and then you</text>
  <text start="965.05" dur="3.69">get into depriving your right to keep</text>
  <text start="967.06" dur="4.019">and bear arms which shall not be</text>
  <text start="968.74" dur="3.839">infringed when you&amp;#39;re issued one of</text>
  <text start="971.079" dur="2.781">these it says there oh you gotta turn in</text>
  <text start="972.579" dur="4.861">your guns</text>
  <text start="973.86" dur="5.469">okay first of all fundamentally princely</text>
  <text start="977.44" dur="3.959">this violates due process of law because</text>
  <text start="979.329" dur="4.021">where is the consent of the government</text>
  <text start="981.399" dur="4.321">one two</text>
  <text start="983.35" dur="5.91">where is the consent of a jury to</text>
  <text start="985.72" dur="6.09">deprive these fundamental rights so that</text>
  <text start="989.26" dur="5.639">subverts the law which in the end comes</text>
  <text start="991.81" dur="5.029">out to treason right as a treasonous act</text>
  <text start="994.899" dur="4.801">because that is internal insurrection</text>
  <text start="996.839" dur="4.421">okay so let me just jump in so what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="999.7" dur="3.21">saying is is when you get one of these</text>
  <text start="1001.26" dur="3.87">restraining orders from the Family Court</text>
  <text start="1002.91" dur="4.2">it automatically says you&amp;#39;re not allowed</text>
  <text start="1005.13" dur="4.319">to have a firearm you&amp;#39;re not allowed to</text>
  <text start="1007.11" dur="4.2">own a gun and and what Kirk is saying is</text>
  <text start="1009.449" dur="5.82">look this is a fundamental Second</text>
  <text start="1011.31" dur="6.99">Amendment right and yet a domestic</text>
  <text start="1015.269" dur="4.531">violence family court then go ahead and</text>
  <text start="1018.3" dur="2.64">just take that right away from you so it</text>
  <text start="1019.8" dur="3.27">seems to me there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="1020.94" dur="5.58">three major issues that you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1023.07" dur="7.44">explain to us number one that this whole</text>
  <text start="1026.52" dur="5.34">domestic violence writing in the</text>
  <text start="1030.51" dur="2.41">Constitution has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="1031.86" dur="3.55">family</text>
  <text start="1032.92" dur="6.42">kourt&amp;#39;s it has to do with an illegal</text>
  <text start="1035.41" dur="6.14">insurrection number two that these</text>
  <text start="1039.34" dur="5.22">family courts that have been set up are</text>
  <text start="1041.55" dur="5.38">basically being abused severely because</text>
  <text start="1044.56" dur="4.47">as we see with Timothy Holmes and bill</text>
  <text start="1046.93" dur="3.33">McConnell they&amp;#39;re not even part of Kim</text>
  <text start="1049.03" dur="6.12">excuse me</text>
  <text start="1050.26" dur="7.41">Katie&amp;#39;s family and number three because</text>
  <text start="1055.15" dur="4.29">these courts are doing this when it</text>
  <text start="1057.67" dur="3.42">clearly says that anything related to</text>
  <text start="1059.44" dur="4.05">domestic violence is supposed to be</text>
  <text start="1061.09" dur="3.96">handled by either the legislature or if</text>
  <text start="1063.49" dur="3.09">the legislature can&amp;#39;t convene the</text>
  <text start="1065.05" dur="6.15">executive branch should be the president</text>
  <text start="1066.58" dur="7.47">but basically the judicial branch the</text>
  <text start="1071.2" dur="4.56">court system is illegally overstepping</text>
  <text start="1074.05" dur="3.51">their bounds by handling this and they</text>
  <text start="1075.76" dur="3.78">actually are the ones committing</text>
  <text start="1077.56" dur="4.89">insurrection or domestic violence</text>
  <text start="1079.54" dur="6.41">against the American people let me let</text>
  <text start="1082.45" dur="6.33">me correct you okay it&amp;#39;s unlawful okay</text>
  <text start="1085.95" dur="4.87">legal legal and illegal have to do with</text>
  <text start="1088.78" dur="5.25">contracts we&amp;#39;re actually talking about</text>
  <text start="1090.82" dur="5.16">here is the law as it is written so when</text>
  <text start="1094.03" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re referencing the law and things in</text>
  <text start="1095.98" dur="5.52">our form of government that have been</text>
  <text start="1098.14" dur="5.61">created that&amp;#39;s unlawful because what the</text>
  <text start="1101.5" dur="6.36">full part is again this is a pronoun</text>
  <text start="1103.75" dur="7.47">unlawful is pronoun full of law so</text>
  <text start="1107.86" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s what unlawful means is it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1111.22" dur="3.51">full of law</text>
  <text start="1112.66" dur="7.29">so that&amp;#39;s de-facto that&amp;#39;s without facts</text>
  <text start="1114.73" dur="6.66">of law so you know when we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1119.95" dur="3.92">about creating this document it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1121.39" dur="6.06">unlawful because the law doesn&amp;#39;t support</text>
  <text start="1123.87" dur="5.59">that creation and again this is this is</text>
  <text start="1127.45" dur="4.32">a key part a lot of people don&amp;#39;t quite</text>
  <text start="1129.46" dur="5.22">comprehend this but we all need to get</text>
  <text start="1131.77" dur="7.86">this the Constitution is the supreme law</text>
  <text start="1134.68" dur="8.79">of the land right yes okay so what does</text>
  <text start="1139.63" dur="7.44">law of the land actually mean what is</text>
  <text start="1143.47" dur="7.35">the lawful definition not the legal what</text>
  <text start="1147.07" dur="6.33">is the lawful definition of law of the</text>
  <text start="1150.82" dur="4.44">land what does that actually mean would</text>
  <text start="1153.4" dur="6.66">that be the what we read in the</text>
  <text start="1155.26" dur="6.33">Constitution of the United States and</text>
  <text start="1160.06" dur="3.18">what I&amp;#39;m asking is this what does it</text>
  <text start="1161.59" dur="3.48">mean what is the definition what else</text>
  <text start="1163.24" dur="2.49">does it mean you know we talked about</text>
  <text start="1165.07" dur="3.45">sinning</text>
  <text start="1165.73" dur="7.05">and you know antonyms and those kinds of</text>
  <text start="1168.52" dur="7.77">things so law the land literally means</text>
  <text start="1172.78" dur="4.74">due process of law okay</text>
  <text start="1176.29" dur="3.33">so when we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="1177.52" dur="4.02">Constitution and the Constitution is the</text>
  <text start="1179.62" dur="3.36">supreme law of the land or in your state</text>
  <text start="1181.54" dur="3.57">is the law of the land</text>
  <text start="1182.98" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re actually what we&amp;#39;re looking at is</text>
  <text start="1185.11" dur="6.09">the due process of law the process that</text>
  <text start="1188.83" dur="4.59">is due and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="1191.2" dur="6.06">Constitution it says this is how the</text>
  <text start="1193.42" dur="6.03">president is brought into being oh this</text>
  <text start="1197.26" dur="5.85">is the process that&amp;#39;s right the</text>
  <text start="1199.45" dur="6.69">Constitution is nothing but processes so</text>
  <text start="1203.11" dur="6.75">in in relation to the the protection</text>
  <text start="1206.14" dur="10.2">orders what process did you use to bring</text>
  <text start="1209.86" dur="8.79">that into being can you cite the law no</text>
  <text start="1216.34" dur="4.5">you can&amp;#39;t because it&amp;#39;s not there so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1218.65" dur="5.52">not full of law and that makes that</text>
  <text start="1220.84" dur="5.67">unlawful you don&amp;#39;t have that authority</text>
  <text start="1224.17" dur="6.98">to just create whatever they want to</text>
  <text start="1226.51" dur="8.1">create and this gets into color of law</text>
  <text start="1231.15" dur="5.47">it sounds like it&amp;#39;s all good</text>
  <text start="1234.61" dur="5.79">it looks legitimate because well the</text>
  <text start="1236.62" dur="6.21">Supreme Court of your state created this</text>
  <text start="1240.4" dur="3.9">document so I mean this goes back to the</text>
  <text start="1242.83" dur="4.32">confidence game and the confidence</text>
  <text start="1244.3" dur="4.44">trickery is hey you know we&amp;#39;re judges of</text>
  <text start="1247.15" dur="3.99">the Supreme Court and we have the</text>
  <text start="1248.74" dur="4.56">authority to create this because we went</text>
  <text start="1251.14" dur="3.75">to law school and we&amp;#39;re sitting in this</text>
  <text start="1253.3" dur="4.94">emolument so we know what we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1254.89" dur="6.33">just trust us right no I don&amp;#39;t think so</text>
  <text start="1258.24" dur="5.83">so we need to wake the people up and</text>
  <text start="1261.22" dur="5.93">understand literally understand stand</text>
  <text start="1264.07" dur="6.63">under the law as it is written and say</text>
  <text start="1267.15" dur="5.89">no this says this here and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1270.7" dur="5.07">say what you&amp;#39;re saying it says so</text>
  <text start="1273.04" dur="5.25">therefore you don&amp;#39;t have subject matter</text>
  <text start="1275.77" dur="5.64">jurisdiction over domestic violence this</text>
  <text start="1278.29" dur="5.67">is void for any effect from its</text>
  <text start="1281.41" dur="4.55">inception not from the day you go to</text>
  <text start="1283.96" dur="4.25">court and branded unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="1285.96" dur="5.91">so this is</text>
  <text start="1288.21" dur="6.66">precisely the reason why field never</text>
  <text start="1291.87" dur="6.96">responded to it because we already know</text>
  <text start="1294.87" dur="5.55">that it&amp;#39;s fraudulent right so so so I</text>
  <text start="1298.83" dur="3.57">understand and I think my viewers</text>
  <text start="1300.42" dur="6.14">probably understand at this point the</text>
  <text start="1302.4" dur="7.86">case that you&amp;#39;re making which makes 100%</text>
  <text start="1306.56" dur="5.83">sense in that everything that the court</text>

  <text start="1804.01" dur="4.62">is when everything started coming out</text>
  <text start="1805.27" dur="5.97">again this is August of 2017 and</text>

  <text start="1830.5" dur="4.47">stuff especially stuff that can be used</text>
  <text start="1833.02" dur="4.5">against them and they&amp;#39;ll they sit around</text>
  <text start="1834.97" dur="4.59">and they conspire and they&amp;#39;ll you know</text>
  <text start="1837.52" dur="4.47">try to draft legislation or whatever</text>
  <text start="1839.56" dur="4.32">even though it&amp;#39;s unlawful and purport</text>
  <text start="1841.99" dur="6.3">that to the people is law and say well</text>
  <text start="1843.88" dur="8.1">yeah this is law to subvert something</text>
  <text start="1848.29" dur="5.79">that may go against them but the problem</text>
  <text start="1851.98" dur="5.37">is is how do you defeat this and you</text>
  <text start="1854.08" dur="5.58">can&amp;#39;t you can&amp;#39;t defeat loss prevention</text>
  <text start="1857.35" dur="6.3">you can&amp;#39;t defeat and emoluments</text>
  <text start="1859.66" dur="6.18">violation the violation is is using your</text>
  <text start="1863.65" dur="7.26">position of employment or holding office</text>
  <text start="1865.84" dur="8.76">as an advantage to get a gain or profit</text>
  <text start="1870.91" dur="5.43">so like we have lobbyists who will come</text>
  <text start="1874.6" dur="5.93">in and pay certain senators or</text>
  <text start="1876.34" dur="7.62">representatives to push a bill through</text>
  <text start="1880.53" dur="6.61">well I don&amp;#39;t have anybody any lobbyists</text>
  <text start="1883.96" dur="6.08">knocking on my door handing me wads of</text>
  <text start="1887.14" dur="7.47">cash money or whatever laundered money</text>
  <text start="1890.04" dur="6.61">to push a bill right so that isn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="1894.61" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s prima facie evidence of using</text>
  <text start="1896.65" dur="4.07">their position of employment as an</text>
  <text start="1898" dur="6.09">advantage to make those profits or games</text>
  <text start="1900.72" dur="5.86">that&amp;#39;s animol units violation and do</text>
  <text start="1904.09" dur="6.32">United States code codifies that under</text>
  <text start="1906.58" dur="6.75">Title 18 subsections 643 that&amp;#39;s a felony</text>
  <text start="1910.41" dur="4.96">you look under embezzlement because</text>
  <text start="1913.33" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s what that is</text>
  <text start="1915.37" dur="6.27">you get under embezzlement and it says a</text>
  <text start="1917.95" dur="6.15">monument so when you use your position</text>
  <text start="1921.64" dur="6.15">of employment such as KP did down in</text>
  <text start="1924.1" dur="6.21">Florida to use her position of</text>
  <text start="1927.79" dur="6.879">employment to procure this fraudulent</text>
  <text start="1930.31" dur="8.14">document that&amp;#39;s animali missed violation</text>
  <text start="1934.669" dur="5.46">now the judge that conspired with her he</text>
  <text start="1938.45" dur="6.089">stepped outside of his scope and</text>
  <text start="1940.129" dur="5.941">authority and granted even even if let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1944.539" dur="4.051">say even if this was a legitimate</text>
  <text start="1946.07" dur="5.76">process that this document was</text>
  <text start="1948.59" dur="5.699">legitimate the document itself asks you</text>
  <text start="1951.83" dur="5.52">how do you know the defendant and</text>
  <text start="1954.289" dur="5.401">actually this is the funny thing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1957.35" dur="6.059">not defendant its respondent so this is</text>
  <text start="1959.69" dur="5.4">civil in nature wait a minute ice could</text>
  <text start="1963.409" dur="5.6">have sworn correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong your</text>
  <text start="1965.09" dur="8.579">brother is not an act of violence</text>
  <text start="1969.009" dur="8.191">criminal in nature right yeah okay so</text>
  <text start="1973.669" dur="8.64">wouldn&amp;#39;t it be plaintiff versus</text>
  <text start="1977.2" dur="8.74">defendant not petitioner versus</text>
  <text start="1982.309" dur="5.46">respondent so the document itself is not</text>
  <text start="1985.94" dur="4.169">proper because if you&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text>
  <text start="1987.769" dur="4.321">about an act of violence that&amp;#39;s criminal</text>

  <text start="2083.099" dur="8.01">side we would file the affidavit make it</text>
  <text start="2088.23" dur="7.609">into a complaint law enforcement would</text>
  <text start="2091.109" dur="9.651">be the prosecutor technically speaking</text>
  <text start="2095.839" dur="8.921">okay so that information would be late</text>

  <text start="2129.539" dur="7.161">so it must be by indictment so you</text>
  <text start="2133.349" dur="6.391">actually have to go over here to the</text>
  <text start="2136.7" dur="7.78">legislature and you have to seek</text>

  <text start="2306.93" dur="6.179">know that you were taught the common law</text>
  <text start="2309.21" dur="6.72">in law school you&amp;#39;re practicing the</text>
  <text start="2313.109" dur="5.191">rules of procedure from the common law</text>
  <text start="2315.93" dur="4.98">because the common law comes from the</text>
  <text start="2318.3" dur="6.39">common law of England and when we</text>
  <text start="2320.91" dur="8.78">separated political bands which is the</text>
  <text start="2324.69" dur="8.679">Lee&amp;#39;s resolution June 7 1776 ratified</text>
  <text start="2329.69" dur="6.289">July 2nd 1776</text>
  <text start="2333.369" dur="4.74">the Declaration of Independence is not</text>
  <text start="2335.979" dur="4.02">the document that separated us from</text>
  <text start="2338.109" dur="4.71">Great Britain it was the LEAs</text>
  <text start="2339.999" dur="4.951">resolutions that&amp;#39;s the document that</text>
  <text start="2342.819" dur="4.381">separated us the Declaration of</text>
  <text start="2344.95" dur="6.559">Independence is declaring our</text>
  <text start="2347.2" dur="8.369">independence from tyranny and itemizing</text>
  <text start="2351.509" dur="8.951">what those declared acts of tyranny look</text>
  <text start="2355.569" dur="8.55">like those acts those characteristics</text>
  <text start="2360.46" dur="9.119">and conduct is not Republican in</text>
  <text start="2364.119" dur="7.65">character so this is why we use the</text>
  <text start="2369.579" dur="6.9">Declaration of Independence is actually</text>
  <text start="2371.769" dur="8.97">in here because that&amp;#39;s the declared acts</text>
  <text start="2376.479" dur="7.38">of tyrants and it amounts to treason</text>
  <text start="2380.739" dur="5.85">because that&amp;#39;s our enemies and treason</text>
  <text start="2383.859" dur="5.49">is defined as giving aid to our enemies</text>
  <text start="2386.589" dur="5.13">so who are our enemies we&amp;#39;ll read the</text>
  <text start="2389.349" dur="3.571">Declaration of Independence that&amp;#39;s who</text>
  <text start="2391.719" dur="3.6">our enemies are</text>
  <text start="2392.92" dur="3.929">and it&amp;#39;s not a matter of who it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2395.319" dur="4.53">matter of the characteristics and</text>
  <text start="2396.849" dur="8.52">conduct of the man that dictates that</text>
  <text start="2399.849" dur="7.23">that is our enemy so fully comprehending</text>
  <text start="2405.369" dur="5.521">what these documents are what they</text>
  <text start="2407.079" dur="6.39">actually mean and again law is that</text>
  <text start="2410.89" dur="5.399">which is laid down ordained or</text>
  <text start="2413.469" dur="5.07">established well when we look at the</text>
  <text start="2416.289" dur="4.29">Constitution it says it&amp;#39;s been ordained</text>
  <text start="2418.539" dur="5.131">and established your state constitution</text>
  <text start="2420.579" dur="5.071">will say it&amp;#39;s ordained or established I</text>
  <text start="2423.67" dur="3.99">haven&amp;#39;t found one that says ordained an</text>
  <text start="2425.65" dur="3.81">established only the Constitution United</text>
  <text start="2427.66" dur="3.929">States of America is ordained and</text>
  <text start="2429.46" dur="4.889">established because it is the supreme</text>
  <text start="2431.589" dur="4.4">law of the land so that leaves laying</text>
  <text start="2434.349" dur="6.14">down the law</text>
  <text start="2435.989" dur="8.971">okay so laying down the law is through</text>
  <text start="2440.489" dur="8.35">declarations you declare the law now</text>
  <text start="2444.96" dur="10.18">Bills of Rights are merely declaratory</text>
  <text start="2448.839" dur="8.851">of the common law oh crap so the Bill of</text>
  <text start="2455.14" dur="5.909">Rights and when I said there is Bills of</text>
  <text start="2457.69" dur="5.909">Rights as in plural because every state</text>
  <text start="2461.049" dur="3.96">Constitution has a Bill of Rights or a</text>
  <text start="2463.599" dur="3.731">declaration of Rights</text>
  <text start="2465.009" dur="5.531">that&amp;#39;s the article one which</text>
  <text start="2467.33" dur="6.57">actually is not the Constitution</text>
  <text start="2470.54" dur="5.6">that&amp;#39;s a declaration that&amp;#39;s separate</text>
  <text start="2473.9" dur="4.86">from the Constitution because</text>
  <text start="2476.14" dur="6.31">constitutions are the law of the land</text>
  <text start="2478.76" dur="9.39">that&amp;#39;s process okay the Bill of Rights</text>
  <text start="2482.45" dur="10.32">is actually the law which the people lay</text>
  <text start="2488.15" dur="6.02">down before instituting government the</text>
  <text start="2492.77" dur="4.77">Constitution</text>
  <text start="2494.17" dur="5.05">so when article 6 Clause 3 says anything</text>
  <text start="2497.54" dur="4.76">in the Constitution or laws of the state</text>
  <text start="2499.22" dur="4.95">to the contrary are not withstanding</text>
  <text start="2502.3" dur="4.48">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="2504.17" dur="5.51">anything in the Bill of Rights</text>
  <text start="2506.78" dur="5.34">or the Constitution of the state</text>
  <text start="2509.68" dur="5.86">anything in there that&amp;#39;s contrary to the</text>
  <text start="2512.12" dur="6.26">supreme law of the land is null and void</text>
  <text start="2515.54" dur="7.23">from its inception C Marbury vs. Madison</text>
  <text start="2518.38" dur="6.85">US versus Throckmorton you know those</text>
  <text start="2522.77" dur="4.25">are two really good cases and then like</text>
  <text start="2525.23" dur="5.9">Cohen versus city of Independence</text>
  <text start="2527.02" dur="7.12">that&amp;#39;s the ultra virus removes all</text>
  <text start="2531.13" dur="5.08">immunity but you have to go to the</text>
  <text start="2534.14" dur="4.38">legislature to remove their immunity</text>
  <text start="2536.21" dur="4.35">from being sued okay so let me let me</text>
  <text start="2538.52" dur="3.81">just intervene here so okay so I I think</text>
  <text start="2540.56" dur="3.42">I understand exactly what each Clause</text>
  <text start="2542.33" dur="4.04">does how you guys started and what</text>
  <text start="2543.98" dur="6.6">you&amp;#39;re doing so what is the endgame Wow</text>

  <text start="2830.43" dur="3.689">others but um so I guess my question is</text>
  <text start="2832.68" dur="3.51">now that you are working with higher up</text>
  <text start="2834.119" dur="3.72">people including President Trump do you</text>
  <text start="2836.19" dur="3.75">think in your personal opinion do you</text>
  <text start="2837.839" dur="4.051">think Phil McConnell is gonna wind up</text>

  <text start="2844.769" dur="3.211">gonna happen with Bill McConnell</text>
  <text start="2846.21" dur="5.46">well we are definitely going to</text>
  <text start="2847.98" dur="8.15">intervene and the you know I I believe</text>
  <text start="2851.67" dur="4.46">that the profile of mr. McConnell</text>
  <text start="2856.52" dur="8.07">is gonna bring the level of emergency up</text>
  <text start="2860.98" dur="7.66">right and technically speaking we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2864.59" dur="6.39">already reported you know because not</text>
  <text start="2868.64" dur="5.49">everything do that we do behind the</text>
  <text start="2870.98" dur="4.79">scenes we put out in the public or we</text>
  <text start="2874.13" dur="4.02">even talk about it</text>
  <text start="2875.77" dur="5.32">but I am gonna say that there are things</text>
  <text start="2878.15" dur="4.77">that we do at ich laws that are</text>
  <text start="2881.09" dur="4.14">definitely behind the scenes and we make</text>
  <text start="2882.92" dur="6.449">our own tiny little reports and we talk</text>
  <text start="2885.23" dur="9.93">to certain people that we let them know</text>
  <text start="2889.369" dur="9.241">what&amp;#39;s going on so with the mr. Holmes</text>
  <text start="2895.16" dur="5.94">death case they&amp;#39;re already under</text>
  <text start="2898.61" dur="4.79">investigation Broward County is already</text>
  <text start="2901.1" dur="2.3">under investigation</text>
  <text start="2903.76" dur="5.68">Polk County is under investigation</text>
  <text start="2906.85" dur="5.26">I&amp;#39;m not sure if you&amp;#39;re aware that the</text>
  <text start="2909.44" dur="4.94">sheriff in Broward County just here a</text>
  <text start="2912.11" dur="8.49">couple weeks ago was removed from duty</text>
  <text start="2914.38" dur="8.17">imagine that now you can go ahead with</text>
  <text start="2920.6" dur="6.509">whatever the mainstream media is telling</text>
  <text start="2922.55" dur="6.53">you why he got removed from duty but you</text>
  <text start="2927.109" dur="4.471">know I&amp;#39;m just gonna leave it at that</text>

  <text start="2939.14" dur="5.13">now</text>
  <text start="2940.15" dur="6.49">so you know things are happening and I</text>
  <text start="2944.27" dur="5.07">really do believe that once we file this</text>
  <text start="2946.64" dur="7.83">paperwork and we send it up the line</text>
  <text start="2949.34" dur="7.83">like we have done in the past that in</text>
  <text start="2954.47" dur="5.22">the end this is all going to be shut</text>
  <text start="2957.17" dur="7.17">down and there will be people removed</text>
  <text start="2959.69" dur="6.51">from duty given the the magnitude of</text>
  <text start="2964.34" dur="5.19">what we&amp;#39;re actually dealing with here</text>
  <text start="2966.2" dur="5.76">and you know that unbeknownst to me for</text>
