  <text start="9.96" dur="8.97">it is the eighth month the new moon</text>
  <text start="14.269" dur="7.09">begins tonight is now the first day of</text>
  <text start="18.93" dur="8.599">the eighth month here on the evening of</text>
  <text start="21.359" dur="10.071">October 15 2012 I included a starry sky</text>
  <text start="27.529" dur="6.28">the picture of this YouTube because the</text>
  <text start="31.43" dur="4.719">appropriate time to celebrate the new</text>
  <text start="33.809" dur="6.09">moon scripturally is when the new moon</text>
  <text start="36.149" dur="7.441">is at conjunction so you don&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="39.899" dur="6.331">it&amp;#39;s completely and totally black when</text>
  <text start="43.59" dur="4.14">the new month begins now how do I know</text>
  <text start="46.23" dur="3.36">the scripturally because I know there</text>
  <text start="47.73" dur="4.649">are a lot of different people out there</text>
  <text start="49.59" dur="6.26">that follow the Crescent or they follow</text>
  <text start="52.379" dur="7.651">some other form of following or</text>
  <text start="55.85" dur="7.33">beginning the new month it&amp;#39;s really very</text>
  <text start="60.03" dur="5.73">simple I&amp;#39;m going to post some articles</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="5.57">if you want a whole lot of material that</text>
  <text start="65.76" dur="5.88">will just almost overwhelm you with</text>
  <text start="68.75" dur="6.13">scriptural information as to why the new</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="6.06">moon conjunction is the scriptural way</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="4.77">to start the new moon to start the new</text>
  <text start="77.7" dur="6.51">month and to start the new year for that</text>
  <text start="79.65" dur="7.88">matter but there is one very very simple</text>
  <text start="84.21" dur="7.019">reason and I think the strongest reason</text>
  <text start="87.53" dur="6.46">why the conjunctive new moon the</text>
  <text start="91.229" dur="5.941">completely black moon is when the new</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="5.16">month starts scripturally and that</text>
  <text start="97.17" dur="8.25">reason is this there is a Hebrew word</text>
  <text start="99.15" dur="9.24">for Crescent it exists and that Hebrew</text>
  <text start="105.42" dur="6.87">word for Crescent is never once used in</text>
  <text start="108.39" dur="11.009">all of Holy Writ in relation to the new</text>
  <text start="112.29" dur="8.789">moon number once you can go from the</text>
  <text start="119.399" dur="4.11">very beginning of the scriptures to the</text>
  <text start="121.079" dur="6.661">very end and you will never ever ever</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="8.7">find the Hebrew word for Crescent used</text>
  <text start="127.74" dur="5.37">in relation to the new moon in modern</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="5.011">day</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="8.64">the Satanists New Agers they love to</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="7.08">venerate and worship the full moon so it</text>
  <text start="141.75" dur="4.53">kind of makes sense that it would be the</text>
  <text start="144.3" dur="4.74">completely black moon the conjunctive</text>
  <text start="146.28" dur="7.23">moon that would be Yas beginning new</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="7.2">beginning for each month this is the</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="6.09">month of bull that&amp;#39;s literally what this</text>
  <text start="156.24" dur="4.95">month is called bul bul means rain this</text>
  <text start="159.6" dur="5.34">is the month when the rains would fall</text>
  <text start="161.19" dur="6.69">in Israel after the harvest had been</text>
  <text start="164.94" dur="4.56">gathered in for Tabernacles then the</text>
  <text start="167.88" dur="4.23">Inca month begins and the rain begins to</text>
  <text start="169.5" dur="5.31">pour and I don&amp;#39;t know about where you</text>
  <text start="172.11" dur="4.98">live but here in Oregon we about 58 days</text>
  <text start="174.81" dur="4.649">of dry weather going through the summer</text>
  <text start="177.09" dur="5.85">and early fall and just a few days ago</text>
  <text start="179.459" dur="7.231">as if on cue the rain started pouring</text>
  <text start="182.94" dur="8.04">like never before so it&amp;#39;s been good to</text>
  <text start="186.69" dur="10.01">get the rain here I think that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="8.85">something that I really want to explore</text>
  <text start="196.7" dur="5.92">for this new moon and that is and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.83" dur="6.23">it&amp;#39;s not a it&amp;#39;s not a complicated</text>
  <text start="202.62" dur="5.76">subject but I think it&amp;#39;s a very very</text>
  <text start="206.06" dur="5.89">important subject if not the most</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="5.82">important subject you know I hear a lot</text>
  <text start="211.95" dur="4.59">of people will not a lot of people but I</text>
  <text start="214.2" dur="5.099">hear some people within the Messianic</text>
  <text start="216.54" dur="4.94">movement saying oh we&amp;#39;re centering on</text>
  <text start="219.299" dur="7.561">Yahshua too much need to have a balance</text>
  <text start="221.48" dur="9.22">no no that is wrong we need to Center</text>
  <text start="226.86" dur="7.68">completely and totally on Yahshua he is</text>
  <text start="230.7" dur="5.64">the Torah clothed in flesh and Yahshua</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="4.56">must remain the center of everything</text>
  <text start="236.34" dur="8.36">just as Yahshua is the center of all of</text>
  <text start="239.1" dur="8.4">Scripture now there is a movement afoot</text>
  <text start="244.7" dur="8.98">where people try to say that Jesus or</text>
  <text start="247.5" dur="9.9">Yahshua is not deity is not Yahweh that</text>
  <text start="253.68" dur="6.57">Yahweh is somehow higher than Yahshua</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="6.269">that Yahshua is just like a mediator or</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="5.889">messenger and he is a mediator but</text>
  <text start="263.669" dur="4.9">Joshua is young</text>
  <text start="266.139" dur="4.5">way in the flesh and there&amp;#39;s a very very</text>
  <text start="268.569" dur="4.47">easy way to prove it now there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="270.639" dur="6.21">of scripture to show that Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="273.039" dur="6.541">Yahweh in the flesh but I like this very</text>
  <text start="276.849" dur="10.171">simplistic way of explaining it if you</text>
  <text start="279.58" dur="11.669">look in Isaiah chapter 42 and verse 8</text>
  <text start="287.02" dur="5.729">Isaiah 42 and verse 8 we read and we</text>
  <text start="291.249" dur="6.241">know you&amp;#39;re always talking because it</text>
  <text start="292.749" dur="8.491">starts off by saying I am Yahweh so</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="6.209">Isaiah 42 verse 8 I am Yahweh that is my</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="5.28">name and my glory will I not give to</text>
  <text start="303.699" dur="8.94">another neither my praise to graven</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="9.179">images so Yahweh yeah he says he will</text>
  <text start="312.639" dur="9.541">not give his glory with it to anyone</text>
  <text start="315.699" dur="11.19">else he will not give his glory anyone</text>
  <text start="322.18" dur="6.329">else and yet we read in the brit</text>
  <text start="326.889" dur="5.55">hadashah the New Testament the New</text>
  <text start="328.509" dur="8.16">Covenant John chapter 17 jochen on</text>
  <text start="332.439" dur="6.241">chapter 17 verse 1 these words fake</text>
  <text start="336.669" dur="5.46">Joshua and lifted up his eyes to heaven</text>
  <text start="338.68" dur="8.43">and said father the hour is come glorify</text>
  <text start="342.129" dur="9">your son that your son also mail or if I</text>
  <text start="347.11" dur="9.089">you well now wait a minute we just read</text>
  <text start="351.129" dur="8.371">in Isaiah 42 8 that Yahweh will share</text>
  <text start="356.199" dur="6.631">his glory with no one he will not give</text>
  <text start="359.5" dur="8.339">his glory to another Joshua says for the</text>
  <text start="362.83" dur="10.639">father to glorify Him and why because</text>
  <text start="367.839" dur="9.35">Yahshua is Yahweh manifest in the flesh</text>
  <text start="373.469" dur="6.72">anyone who says differently is a liar</text>
  <text start="377.189" dur="5.98">anyone who says differently is deceived</text>
  <text start="380.189" dur="8.38">anyone who sit says differently is</text>
  <text start="383.169" dur="10.701">misled Yahshua is Yahweh manifest in the</text>
  <text start="388.569" dur="8.4">flesh Yahshua is the center of the Torah</text>
  <text start="393.87" dur="5.969">Yahshua is the center of all the</text>
  <text start="396.969" dur="6">scriptures from Genesis to Revelation</text>
  <text start="399.839" dur="5.05">I&amp;#39;m going to post a link also to who is</text>

  <text start="410.289" dur="7.231">scriptures paints a very clear picture</text>

  <text start="417.52" dur="7.41">aspect of who Yahshua is now people say</text>
  <text start="422.74" dur="4.229">well how could ya shua be on earth you</text>
