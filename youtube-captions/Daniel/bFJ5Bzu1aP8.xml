  <text start="0.03" dur="7.41">everybody it is April 3rd 2019 it is the</text>
  <text start="5.31" dur="5.31">28th day of the twelfth every month</text>
  <text start="7.44" dur="7.56">almost the 29th day we&amp;#39;re getting close</text>
  <text start="10.62" dur="8.999">to the to the Hebrew new year very very</text>
  <text start="15" dur="8.91">close so I did make a pretty big error</text>
  <text start="19.619" dur="6.871">in my video earlier today and I did put</text>
  <text start="23.91" dur="6.09">a pin comment beneath the video to let</text>
  <text start="26.49" dur="6.15">everyone know but apparently I mixed up</text>
  <text start="30" dur="7.59">the temple Sinai in New Jersey with the</text>
  <text start="32.64" dur="8.31">temple Sinai in Washington DC so there</text>
  <text start="37.59" dur="10.11">was there was a memorial service on the</text>
  <text start="40.95" dur="9.629">31st at at this temple in in DC so I I</text>
  <text start="47.7" dur="5.91">what I did is I went to this Daniele</text>
  <text start="50.579" dur="5.521">Blumenthal I guess she&amp;#39;s a doctor I went</text>
  <text start="53.61" dur="7.14">to her Twitter and what was becoming</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="6.9">even more confusing was that you know</text>
  <text start="60.75" dur="3.869">you start reading her tweets and you</text>
  <text start="63" dur="9.479">start looking at the thing she&amp;#39;s posting</text>
  <text start="64.619" dur="10.89">she seems like a pro potus pro q type of</text>
  <text start="72.479" dur="6.03">person and yet she&amp;#39;s the one who says</text>
  <text start="75.509" dur="7.411">that she saw Ruth Bader Ginsburg at this</text>
  <text start="78.509" dur="6.15">temple on Sunday and and that she and</text>
  <text start="82.92" dur="6.42">her husband you know went to take a</text>
  <text start="84.659" dur="8.67">photo well this was really causing me to</text>
  <text start="89.34" dur="7.08">become very perplexed and so I I did</text>
  <text start="93.329" dur="8.881">some more digging and I found a thread</text>
  <text start="96.42" dur="9.3">that she had posted earlier today</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="5.1">actually April 3rd and and she goes</text>
  <text start="105.72" dur="2.969">through all these different bullet</text>
  <text start="107.31" dur="5.449">points there&amp;#39;s like 50 different bullet</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="6.781">points of what she&amp;#39;s trying to to</text>
  <text start="112.759" dur="5.86">promote it&amp;#39;s actually rather confusing</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="7.039">and hard to follow but at number 46 she</text>
  <text start="118.619" dur="3.89">she writes this I&amp;#39;ll just show it here</text>
  <text start="123.34" dur="5.98">there it is uh at the end of the day I</text>
  <text start="127.37" dur="4.77">think this is the problem with the whole</text>
  <text start="129.32" dur="5.22">queue narrative it is based on telling</text>
  <text start="132.14" dur="3.99">us one side of the truth and there is</text>
  <text start="134.54" dur="5.52">another also upsetting side that will</text>
  <text start="136.13" dur="8.16">make the president look ugly Daniele</text>
  <text start="140.06" dur="6.45">Blumenthal so right there I was like</text>
  <text start="144.29" dur="6.3">wait a minute this doesn&amp;#39;t sound like a</text>
  <text start="146.51" dur="6.21">pro Trump pro-q person why would she be</text>
  <text start="150.59" dur="6.96">saying this that that cue is only saying</text>
  <text start="152.72" dur="7.44">telling us one side of the truth so I</text>
  <text start="157.55" dur="4.29">looked at that and then I you know</text>
  <text start="160.16" dur="3.81">looked at the supposed picture that she</text>
  <text start="161.84" dur="3.54">took and and she and her husband are the</text>
  <text start="163.97" dur="3.6">only ones that took a photo of Ruth</text>
  <text start="165.38" dur="4.98">Bader Ginsburg even though you know this</text>
  <text start="167.57" dur="3.99">is controversial all across the United</text>
  <text start="170.36" dur="3.18">States everyone wants to know if she&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="171.56" dur="3.47">library dead and for some reason only</text>
  <text start="173.54" dur="6">she and her husband could take a</text>
  <text start="175.03" dur="5.92">supposed picture and she goes to great</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="3.9">lengths to convince people on her</text>
  <text start="180.95" dur="5.07">Twitter that she is a you know president</text>
  <text start="183.44" dur="4.41">Trump supporter that she goes along with</text>
  <text start="186.02" dur="6.21">the cute narrative but but then buried</text>
  <text start="187.85" dur="5.55">in her points you see that she says she</text>
  <text start="192.23" dur="4.53">doesn&amp;#39;t actually really believe the</text>
  <text start="193.4" dur="6">whole cue narrative basically she she</text>
  <text start="196.76" dur="8.13">undermines it and she thinks there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="199.4" dur="7.53">ugly side to President Trump so I I</text>
  <text start="204.89" dur="5.67">think that basically what we&amp;#39;re dealing</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="8.22">with is someone who&amp;#39;s a LARP someone</text>
  <text start="210.56" dur="10.88">who&amp;#39;s probably a pro Hillary or pro</text>
  <text start="215.15" dur="10.619">Bernie Sanders or liberal trying to</text>
  <text start="221.44" dur="6.19">trying to cause the patriot movement the</text>
  <text start="225.769" dur="4.891">cube movement to to begin to question</text>
  <text start="227.63" dur="6.81">themselves look neon revolt put out a</text>
  <text start="230.66" dur="5.79">very very very well documented and</text>
  <text start="234.44" dur="5.67">convincing article that I reported on</text>
  <text start="236.45" dur="6.33">last week where for some strange reason</text>
  <text start="240.11" dur="5.46">the Supreme Court inserted her voice</text>
  <text start="242.78" dur="7.35">Ruth Bader Ginsburg&amp;#39;s voice into the</text>
  <text start="245.57" dur="7.37">hearings in March so why would they need</text>
  <text start="250.13" dur="7.7">to do that if it&amp;#39;s better Ginsburg is</text>
  <text start="252.94" dur="7.799">you know going to Temple so I think that</text>
  <text start="257.83" dur="5.28">this Danielle Blumenthal I think she&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="260.739" dur="5.611">fake I think she&amp;#39;s a fake and I think</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re I think they they purposely</text>
  <text start="266.35" dur="5.94">tried to pick someone who sounded like a</text>
  <text start="268.48" dur="5.37">pro Trump pro q person although when you</text>
  <text start="272.29" dur="5.73">did do some digging you find out she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="273.85" dur="6.51">not actually that Pro Q and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.02" dur="6.84">putting on disinformation is what I well</text>
  <text start="280.36" dur="9.06">that what I think is happening so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="284.86" dur="6.15">those are my thoughts I just I had to</text>
  <text start="289.42" dur="6.87">capture these mountains as the Sun is</text>
