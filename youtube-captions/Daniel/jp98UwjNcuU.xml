  <text start="0" dur="3.72">like an idol in my heart where I wanted</text>
  <text start="2.159" dur="3.301">to do that no matter what and it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3.72" dur="4.53">until I sort of gave that up and said</text>
  <text start="5.46" dur="5.91">you know maybe even though marriage is a</text>
  <text start="8.25" dur="4.53">good thing maybe God&amp;#39;s trying to say I</text>
  <text start="11.37" dur="4.08">have something else for you and so when</text>
  <text start="12.78" dur="6.57">I just gave it up it&amp;#39;s like now I&amp;#39;m so</text>
  <text start="15.45" dur="5.43">I&amp;#39;m so just my life so exciting doing</text>
  <text start="19.35" dur="3.179">things for him but I don&amp;#39;t really even</text>
  <text start="20.88" dur="3.569">think about that anymore and I think I</text>
  <text start="22.529" dur="3.151">think that&amp;#39;s what God does because you</text>
  <text start="24.449" dur="3.84">can even have an idol that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="25.68" dur="4.32">supposedly a good thing but if you put</text>
  <text start="28.289" dur="4.47">it above what God wants for you then it</text>
  <text start="30" dur="3.989">becomes like Dollar Tree so praise God</text>
  <text start="32.759" dur="2.581">it looks like God&amp;#39;s reaching out to you</text>
  <text start="33.989" dur="2.671">and we do I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="35.34" dur="3.03">interested in this but we actually meet</text>
  <text start="36.66" dur="4.02">every single night on the computer we</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="3.72">use a program called zoom and if you</text>
  <text start="40.68" dur="2.94">download it it&amp;#39;s like Skype or it</text>
  <text start="42.09" dur="5.25">transforms your phone or your laptop</text>
  <text start="43.62" dur="5.759">into an audio-video platform and about</text>
  <text start="47.34" dur="5.609">three or four of us meet every single</text>
  <text start="49.379" dur="4.02">night and all we do is we pray for each</text>
  <text start="52.949" dur="3">other</text>
  <text start="53.399" dur="4.111">and we lift each other up and sing</text>
  <text start="55.949" dur="2.88">praises and the fellowship just like the</text>
  <text start="57.51" dur="3.75">early believers where they would meet</text>
  <text start="58.829" dur="5.281">every single day in the book backs so if</text>
  <text start="61.26" dur="5.64">you ever want to join us on my website</text>
  <text start="64.11" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s a contact form you just spell</text>
  <text start="66.9" dur="3.18">your contacts on it&amp;#39;ll get directed to</text>
  <text start="68.22" dur="3.509">my email and I can put you on that email</text>
  <text start="70.08" dur="2.94">list and I send out that link to every</text>
  <text start="71.729" dur="3.271">single night it&amp;#39;s a different link but I</text>
  <text start="73.02" dur="4.739">send one out every night as long as you</text>
  <text start="75" dur="4.47">have zoom on your whatever phone or</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="2.97">computer you just click on that link</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="2.85">that new link every night you can go</text>
  <text start="80.729" dur="3.541">right right into a place where all of us</text>
  <text start="82.32" dur="4.22">are there just praying for each other</text>
  <text start="84.27" dur="4.47">and I&amp;#39;ve found that having that daily</text>
  <text start="86.54" dur="4.45">encouragement</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s very helpful it&amp;#39;s colorful it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="90.99" dur="3.6">very powerful particularly when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="92.43" dur="3.54">with I mean it&amp;#39;s good of course I have</text>
  <text start="94.59" dur="3.72">my own private times with God every day</text>
  <text start="95.97" dur="4.74">but just like to have times with other</text>
  <text start="98.31" dur="4.44">brothers and sisters every day it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="100.71" dur="3.75">something it really it really</text>
  <text start="102.75" dur="3.21">strengthens you</text>
  <text start="104.46" dur="3.299">I think there&amp;#39;s a reason why the early</text>
  <text start="105.96" dur="6.53">believers in the first century met every</text>
  <text start="107.759" dur="6.9">single day in their homes breaking bread</text>
  <text start="112.49" dur="5.919">and sometimes we don&amp;#39;t meet very long</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="5.49">sometimes we do but but and then the</text>
  <text start="118.409" dur="3.901">other thing I found out too is the more</text>
  <text start="120.149" dur="5.071">I spend time in his presence in prayer</text>
  <text start="122.31" dur="4.919">or others doing that the more efficient</text>
  <text start="125.22" dur="4.019">my life becomes so before I would try</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="5.131">through all the stuff but now that I</text>
  <text start="129.239" dur="5.161">spend more time with his people God now</text>
  <text start="132.36" dur="6.379">though I have less time to do other</text>
  <text start="134.4" dur="4.339">things that less time produces more</text>
  <text start="157.44" dur="3.05">[Music]</text>
  <text start="213.66" dur="8.94">his wonderful counselor mighty</text>
  <text start="218.67" dur="10.12">everlasting father Prince of Peace and</text>
  <text start="222.6" dur="8.32">he died and his gospel has gone out to</text>
  <text start="228.79" dur="5.13">the ends of the earth it&amp;#39;s going out</text>
  <text start="230.92" dur="5.22">again because he is long-suffering and</text>
  <text start="233.92" dur="4.79">he does not desire that anyone should</text>
  <text start="236.14" dur="2.57">perish</text>
  <text start="241.14" dur="7.11">and yet that time is coming to an end it</text>
  <text start="245.32" dur="7.68">says he waits patiently for the ripening</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="8.29">of the fruit of the earth and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253" dur="5.52">waited for many many long long thousands</text>
  <text start="256.54" dur="2.61">of years but but that time is coming to</text>
  <text start="258.52" dur="2.61">an end</text>
  <text start="259.15" dur="3.81">and I&amp;#39;m here to proclaim that when the</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="4.8">Messiah does return it will be too late</text>
  <text start="262.96" dur="3.63">if you&amp;#39;ve not given your life to him it</text>
  <text start="265.93" dur="2.61">will be too late</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="5.16">and that&amp;#39;s why today for their salvation</text>
  <text start="268.54" dur="5.37">that&amp;#39;s why today we&amp;#39;ve got to humble</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="5.22">ourselves and grab a hold of his seat</text>
  <text start="273.91" dur="5.85">seat and that&amp;#39;s why one of the last</text>
  <text start="276.97" dur="6.15">verses in this Bible it says let him who</text>
  <text start="279.76" dur="5.73">is righteous be righteous still and him</text>
  <text start="283.12" dur="4.65">who is filthy be filthy still and then</text>
  <text start="285.49" dur="3.36">who&amp;#39;s wicked wicked still and him who is</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="4.92">holy be holy still</text>
  <text start="288.85" dur="5.88">in other words as we get closer and</text>
  <text start="292.69" dur="4.71">closer for the time when the Messiah</text>
  <text start="294.73" dur="5.52">returns all of us will get closer and</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="6.08">closer toward making our final decision</text>
  <text start="300.25" dur="5.76">of where we&amp;#39;re going to spend eternity</text>
  <text start="303.48" dur="6.91">and we could either spend it with him as</text>
  <text start="306.01" dur="7.11">we were designed to or go to a place</text>
  <text start="310.39" dur="5.33">that was never intended for us a place</text>
  <text start="313.12" dur="6.81">that&amp;#39;s reserved for the fallen angels</text>
  <text start="315.72" dur="6.94">the devil&amp;#39;s will make a fire and this is</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="6">not what God wants because it says it</text>
  <text start="322.66" dur="6.72">says he does not take pleasure in the</text>
  <text start="325.93" dur="6.98">death of the wicked he does not take</text>
  <text start="329.38" dur="3.53">pleasure in the death</text>
  <text start="333.09" dur="6.49">but he will not override your free will</text>
  <text start="336.909" dur="5.13">people say well if God is good why is</text>
  <text start="339.58" dur="5.519">there all this evil in the world because</text>
  <text start="342.039" dur="5.97">you cannot blame a holy God for the</text>
  <text start="345.099" dur="6.241">choices of wicked human beings he made</text>
  <text start="348.009" dur="6.06">us in His image and so we do have free</text>
  <text start="351.34" dur="8.49">will although because we&amp;#39;re not God he</text>
  <text start="354.069" dur="7.35">does put a limit on what we could do he</text>
  <text start="359.83" dur="4.98">puts a limit on how much the structure</text>
  <text start="361.419" dur="6.87">we can cause but we humans can cause a</text>
  <text start="364.81" dur="9.59">lot of destruction even on an individual</text>
  <text start="368.289" dur="6.111">basis when we refuse to repent</text>
  <text start="374.639" dur="4.891">and agree to the conditions with the</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="5.399">coven it is the only way to break the</text>
  <text start="379.53" dur="4.47">chains of human selfishness in one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="381.479" dur="5.671">heart is by the blood of Yeshua of</text>
  <text start="384" dur="5.969">Nazareth through his spirit obeying his</text>
  <text start="387.15" dur="6.93">word it is the only way it is the only</text>
  <text start="389.969" dur="5.94">solution to human selfishness there is</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="5.82">no other solution there is no other way</text>
  <text start="395.909" dur="6.991">and this is why the Messiah said I am</text>
  <text start="399.9" dur="4.68">the way the truth and the life and there</text>
  <text start="402.9" dur="6.829">is no other way to the Father except</text>
  <text start="404.58" dur="9.329">through me he wasn&amp;#39;t being arrogant or</text>
  <text start="409.729" dur="7.541">exclusive or intolerant he was simply</text>
  <text start="413.909" dur="6.841">stating the truth that there is only one</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="6.299">way to escape to make the fire there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="420.75" dur="6.87">only one way to escape our own lust and</text>
  <text start="423.569" dur="5.97">selfishness that we&amp;#39;re enslaved by and</text>
  <text start="427.62" dur="9.12">that is through the Spirit of the Living</text>
  <text start="429.539" dur="10.581">God by his blood</text>
  <text start="436.74" dur="12.18">those red washes us from our past sin</text>
  <text start="440.12" dur="12.72">and its spirit Jesus told that woman</text>
  <text start="448.92" dur="3.92">caught in adultery go and sin no more</text>
  <text start="455.72" dur="9.16">Jesus because Jesus clearly said to that</text>
  <text start="460.26" dur="5.91">woman go and sin no more so did Jesus</text>
  <text start="464.88" dur="3.47">tell her to do something that was</text>
  <text start="466.17" dur="6.35">impossible to do because the beginning</text>
  <text start="468.35" dur="7.66">Jesus was a lunatic and not the servant</text>
  <text start="472.52" dur="5.86">but she was broken Tom&amp;#39;s right she was</text>
  <text start="476.01" dur="7.88">repentant she was tired of her life of</text>
  <text start="478.38" dur="5.51">sin and so she was ready for the Messiah</text>
  <text start="489.5" dur="10.59">and through his spirit and by his blood</text>
  <text start="493.54" dur="10.57">we truly can oh bam we can truly love</text>
  <text start="500.09" dur="7.74">them as we ought but that&amp;#39;s the only way</text>
  <text start="504.11" dur="8.52">we can and that&amp;#39;s why the scripture says</text>
  <text start="507.83" dur="7.79">in psalm 119 it says that those who walk</text>
  <text start="512.63" dur="5.88">in his ways will do no iniquity</text>
  <text start="515.62" dur="4.87">because once Jesus truly sits on the</text>
  <text start="518.51" dur="5.49">throne of your heart you will not</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="5.07">continue in your sin when you love them</text>
  <text start="524" dur="3.45">with everything in you and you love your</text>
  <text start="525.56" dur="3.57">neighbor as yourself you cannot be</text>
  <text start="527.45" dur="4.05">committing acts of selfishness at the</text>
  <text start="529.13" dur="4.35">same time because it&amp;#39;s mutually</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="4.28">exclusive they&amp;#39;re two opposite</text>
  <text start="533.48" dur="2.3">directions</text>
  <text start="539.67" dur="13.65">Jesus strike the only solution the human</text>
  <text start="542.48" dur="15.46">condition of sin and selfishness we can</text>
  <text start="553.32" dur="15.05">actually overcome sin we can actually</text>
  <text start="557.94" dur="10.43">obey brings blessing brings life to us</text>
  <text start="570.47" dur="5.32">that&amp;#39;s why Paul said in Romans seven</text>
  <text start="573.09" dur="5.16">this laws are gained into life but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.79" dur="5.58">ordained to the death when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="578.25" dur="10.61">selfish the very same laws that bless</text>
  <text start="581.37" dur="10.35">you we love him and make no mistake</text>
  <text start="588.86" dur="5.05">viable to stop betray sinners as victims</text>
  <text start="591.72" dur="5.28">the Bible portrays sinners is actively</text>
  <text start="593.91" dur="5.94">at war against God when it comes down to</text>
  <text start="597" dur="4.56">it when you&amp;#39;re living selfishly if you</text>
  <text start="599.85" dur="9.36">have the opportunity you would try to</text>
  <text start="601.56" dur="10.35">rip God off his throne and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="609.21" dur="5.46">you&amp;#39;ve got to have the cross you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="611.91" dur="5.4">the blood of Messiah break your sin and</text>
  <text start="614.67" dur="5.01">break their selfishness that&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="617.31" dur="4.53">solution because without it you will</text>
  <text start="619.68" dur="4.65">continue in sin that&amp;#39;s why all these</text>
  <text start="621.84" dur="4.86">religions all these philosophies all</text>
  <text start="624.33" dur="5.31">these different paths they all have one</text>
  <text start="626.7" dur="9.15">thing in common they allow you to</text>
  <text start="629.64" dur="7.5">continue to sin it is only by the power</text>
  <text start="635.85" dur="3.66">of the blood of Messiah</text>
  <text start="637.14" dur="5.01">and by his spirit that you can actually</text>
  <text start="639.51" dur="4.62">overcome sin that you can actually break</text>
  <text start="642.15" dur="4.26">the bonds of selfishness because it&amp;#39;s</text>
