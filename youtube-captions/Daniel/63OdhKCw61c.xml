  <text start="1.949" dur="13.67">day getting close to the end anyway</text>
  <text start="6.68" dur="12.179">beautiful sunset over the mountains hmm</text>
  <text start="15.619" dur="3.24">so beautiful</text>
  <text start="20.42" dur="8.369">so I normally only do the evening</text>
  <text start="26.449" dur="4.441">Sabbath teaching the air of Shabbat</text>
  <text start="28.789" dur="4.59">teaching and then I do the Sabbath hike</text>
  <text start="30.89" dur="4.23">but I been asked by two different</text>
  <text start="33.379" dur="3.301">subscribers to do a teaching on the head</text>
  <text start="35.12" dur="6.36">coverings and so I felt like that was</text>
  <text start="36.68" dur="9.87">confirmation to do one so we can get big</text>
  <text start="41.48" dur="7.079">mountains so I&amp;#39;m gonna do a brief</text>
  <text start="46.55" dur="5.39">teaching on head coverings as the</text>
  <text start="48.559" dur="5.791">Shabbat is closing out tonight</text>
  <text start="51.94" dur="3.31">essentially a head cover this is people</text>
  <text start="54.35" dur="4.529">have asked me about this out this is</text>
  <text start="55.25" dur="4.71">100% linen a men&amp;#39;s head covering men&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="58.879" dur="2.7">head coverings are different from</text>
  <text start="59.96" dur="3.75">women&amp;#39;s women&amp;#39;s are usually long and</text>
  <text start="61.579" dur="4.591">flowing and the man&amp;#39;s head covering it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="63.71" dur="4.92">more like this if you go to the Torah</text>
  <text start="66.17" dur="3.72">the priest Levitical priests always wore</text>
  <text start="68.63" dur="3.57">head coverings when they did temple</text>
  <text start="69.89" dur="6.21">service and in Revelation 1 it says</text>
  <text start="72.2" dur="5.55">we&amp;#39;re all priests and kings now some</text>
  <text start="76.1" dur="3.21">people will bring up 1st Corinthians 11</text>
  <text start="77.75" dur="3.84">and say wait a minute Daniel Paul says</text>
  <text start="79.31" dur="3.119">clearly do not men should not wear head</text>
  <text start="81.59" dur="2.97">coverings when they&amp;#39;re praying</text>
  <text start="82.429" dur="4.26">prophesying so that&amp;#39;s actually not what</text>
  <text start="84.56" dur="4.29">Paul&amp;#39;s saying remember Paul was a master</text>
  <text start="86.689" dur="5.191">master Torah scholar he was trained by</text>
  <text start="88.85" dur="4.949">Camellia himself so he certainly knew</text>
  <text start="91.88" dur="4.32">Torah backwards and forwards both before</text>
  <text start="93.799" dur="4.561">he was converted and after and he never</text>
  <text start="96.2" dur="3.629">taught against Torah after he was</text>
  <text start="98.36" dur="3.39">converted and followed Yahshua the</text>
  <text start="99.829" dur="3.811">Jewish Messiah he continued to teach</text>
  <text start="101.75" dur="5.43">Torah and they were they falsely accused</text>
  <text start="103.64" dur="4.799">him of opposing Torah but in acts he</text>
  <text start="107.18" dur="3.42">makes it very clear in the book of Acts</text>
  <text start="108.439" dur="3.601">that he&amp;#39;s never taught against Torah in</text>
  <text start="110.6" dur="3.03">fact he always encourages people to</text>
  <text start="112.04" dur="4.05">follow Torah because that brings us</text>
  <text start="113.63" dur="4.98">closer to Messiah in 1st Corinthians</text>
  <text start="116.09" dur="4.02">chapter 11 he&amp;#39;s dealing with a messianic</text>
  <text start="118.61" dur="3.719">congregation in the city of Corinth</text>
  <text start="120.11" dur="5.07">there&amp;#39;s a lot of strange fire in Corinth</text>
  <text start="122.329" dur="4.65">they had to get a lot of Corrections but</text>
  <text start="125.18" dur="4.499">in that specific chapter if you actually</text>
  <text start="126.979" dur="5.221">go to the the Greek manuscript of what</text>
  <text start="129.679" dur="3.601">Paul saying there and of course I think</text>
  <text start="132.2" dur="2.789">it might have even been the original</text>
  <text start="133.28" dur="3.929">written in Hebrew but just going to the</text>
  <text start="134.989" dur="4.111">Greek behind the English there you can</text>
  <text start="137.209" dur="4.951">see that what Paul&amp;#39;s saying is that</text>
  <text start="139.1" dur="4.199">women are to wear long flowing head</text>
  <text start="142.16" dur="3.57">coverings when they&amp;#39;re praying or</text>
  <text start="143.299" dur="5.731">prophesying and men are not to wear</text>
  <text start="145.73" dur="5.79">these long flowing veils</text>
  <text start="149.03" dur="4.47">because what was happening Corinth is</text>
  <text start="151.52" dur="3.84">there was cross-dressing going on a lot</text>
  <text start="153.5" dur="3.18">of cross-dressing and so Paul was trying</text>
  <text start="155.36" dur="3.81">to clear that up within the Corinth</text>
  <text start="156.68" dur="4.68">assembly itself cross-dressing of course</text>
  <text start="159.17" dur="3.63">is a violation of Torah it says that a</text>
  <text start="161.36" dur="3.78">woman shall not wear what pertains to a</text>
  <text start="162.8" dur="4.59">man and vice versa so a man&amp;#39;s to wear a</text>
  <text start="165.14" dur="3.87">man&amp;#39;s head covering and a woman a long</text>
  <text start="167.39" dur="5.1">flowing whenever we prayer prophesied</text>
  <text start="169.01" dur="6.48">this is further confirmed when Paul says</text>
  <text start="172.49" dur="4.41">that if we overcome if we continue to</text>
  <text start="175.49" dur="4.05">love yah with everything in us and we</text>
  <text start="176.9" dur="5.1">overcome then when we enter eternity we</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="3.75">will inherit a crown of salvation that</text>
  <text start="182" dur="4.17">means we&amp;#39;re gonna have a head covering</text>
  <text start="183.29" dur="5.16">on our resurrected body for eternity and</text>
  <text start="186.17" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s further commercial confirmed when</text>
  <text start="188.45" dur="3.75">you go to Revelation chapter 19 when</text>
  <text start="190.34" dur="4.11">Yahshua the Messiah of Israel returns</text>
  <text start="192.2" dur="4.23">and power and glory from the sky what</text>
  <text start="194.45" dur="4.59">does it say it says that the Messiah of</text>
  <text start="196.43" dur="4.38">Israel will have many crowns upon his</text>
  <text start="199.04" dur="3.15">head of course</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="3.57">rabbi greg has a really good teaching</text>
  <text start="202.19" dur="4.62">about that - he&amp;#39;s talks about how every</text>
  <text start="204.38" dur="4.38">crown that you get it shows that the</text>
  <text start="206.81" dur="3.24">kingdom that he&amp;#39;s conquered and of</text>
  <text start="208.76" dur="2.67">course when Yahshua returns he has</text>
  <text start="210.05" dur="2.52">conquered all the kingdoms of the world</text>
  <text start="211.43" dur="3.03">so that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s wearing all these</text>
  <text start="212.57" dur="3.36">different crowns but he has a head</text>
  <text start="214.46" dur="3.48">covering those a crown is a head</text>
  <text start="215.93" dur="4.02">covering every king and priest has a</text>
  <text start="217.94" dur="4.29">head covering all through scripture so</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="4.59">even Yahshua in his resurrected body as</text>
  <text start="222.23" dur="5.1">a returns from power and glory from the</text>
  <text start="224.54" dur="5.88">sky no longer a carpenter but now a king</text>
  <text start="227.33" dur="4.92">he will have a head covering so since</text>
  <text start="230.42" dur="4.17">our resurrected bodies will have head</text>
  <text start="232.25" dur="5.16">coverings and since Yahshua himself will</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="5.22">have head covering why not us why not us</text>
  <text start="237.41" dur="4.049">having a head covering it&amp;#39;s a powerful</text>
  <text start="239.81" dur="3.149">thing when you do it especially for</text>
  <text start="241.459" dur="2.941">women there&amp;#39;s a scripture in 1st</text>
  <text start="242.959" dur="4.021">Corinthians 11 that says when a woman</text>
  <text start="244.4" dur="4.65">covers her head with that long feminine</text>
  <text start="246.98" dur="4.65">veil when she prays or prophesies she</text>
  <text start="249.05" dur="4.95">has power over the Angels women can be</text>
  <text start="251.63" dur="3.9">easily deceived by fallen angels that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254" dur="3.57">what happened in Adam and Eve Adam</text>
  <text start="255.53" dur="4.11">wasn&amp;#39;t deceived he willfully disobeyed</text>
  <text start="257.57" dur="3.93">but he was deceived but when a woman</text>
  <text start="259.64" dur="4.56">wears a head covering when she prays or</text>
  <text start="261.5" dur="4.71">prophesying it&amp;#39;s a act of obedience that</text>
  <text start="264.2" dur="4.05">causes these fallen angels to stand back</text>
  <text start="266.21" dur="3.9">so head coverings can be very very</text>
  <text start="268.25" dur="3.03">powerful I prefer the hundred percent</text>
  <text start="270.11" dur="3.57">linen because that&amp;#39;s what the priests</text>
  <text start="271.28" dur="3.87">actually wore linen is a very healing</text>
  <text start="273.68" dur="4.94">fabric if you know anything about how</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="5.34">fabrics heal and the energy levels exude</text>
  <text start="278.62" dur="6.44">linen is probably one of the most</text>
  <text start="280.49" dur="6.49">healing fabrics for your body okay so at</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="3.45">and to first Corinthians 11 or toward</text>
  <text start="286.98" dur="3.72">the end Paul says look if anyone&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="288.51" dur="3.96">to be contentious over this issue drop</text>
  <text start="290.7" dur="3.9">it there&amp;#39;s more important things so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="292.47" dur="4.23">not gonna raise a contention over this</text>
  <text start="294.6" dur="3.66">issue but I would encourage you to study</text>
  <text start="296.7" dur="3.81">this issue out more thoroughly yourself</text>
  <text start="298.26" dur="4.74">because ever since I chose to wear a</text>
  <text start="300.51" dur="5.22">head covering and I learned about it my</text>
  <text start="303" dur="4.32">mind is much more clarified I can think</text>
  <text start="305.73" dur="3.84">much more clearly I don&amp;#39;t nearly have as</text>
  <text start="307.32" dur="4.11">much problems with Devils messing with</text>
  <text start="309.57" dur="4.44">my mind and look I know not everyone</text>
  <text start="311.43" dur="4.08">agrees with this even the pastor I</text>
  <text start="314.01" dur="3.87">recommend doesn&amp;#39;t wear a head covering</text>
  <text start="315.51" dur="3.72">but I do think I do think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="317.88" dur="3.03">commandment I think it&amp;#39;s in Scripture I</text>
  <text start="319.23" dur="3.45">think it&amp;#39;s a principle from Genesis all</text>
  <text start="320.91" dur="5.51">the way through revelation and I believe</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="7.8">the Bible never contradicts itself so I</text>
  <text start="326.42" dur="5.98">hope this helped okay shabbat shalom</text>
  <text start="330.48" dur="3.51">from alaska here everyone i&amp;#39;ll leave</text>
  <text start="332.4" dur="4.56">everyone with just the last little look</text>
  <text start="333.99" dur="8.24">of this beautiful sunset that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="336.96" dur="5.27">having probably hear the ocean</text>
  <text start="347.95" dur="6.29">[Applause]</text>
