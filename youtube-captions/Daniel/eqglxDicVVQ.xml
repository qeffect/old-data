  <text start="107.869" dur="6.961">compassion renewed my heart with joy</text>
  <text start="110.06" dur="6.57">indescribable I loved the Jews I love</text>
  <text start="114.83" dur="4.71">them more than I could ever explain and</text>

  <text start="125.78" dur="3.869">ordering our food sitting down to eat</text>
  <text start="127.46" dur="3.93">students began to ask Annika and me</text>
  <text start="129.649" dur="3.571">several questions about the Torah and</text>
  <text start="131.39" dur="4.65">Messiah and how everything fit together</text>
  <text start="133.22" dur="5.28">as I excitedly answered their questions</text>
  <text start="136.04" dur="4.74">I noticed a single old Jewish man</text>
  <text start="138.5" dur="4.59">sitting in the corner he wore a wide</text>
  <text start="140.78" dur="5.28">brim black hat typical of the Orthodox</text>
  <text start="143.09" dur="5.91">Jewish look a thick white beard tumble</text>
  <text start="146.06" dur="5.22">down his chest his white fringes absent</text>
  <text start="149" dur="4.709">the Torah required blue proved this was</text>
  <text start="151.28" dur="5.549">a die-hard Orthodox Jew and maybe even a</text>
  <text start="153.709" dur="4.411">rabbi every 10 minutes or so as I answer</text>
  <text start="156.829" dur="3.301">the questions of these students I</text>
  <text start="158.12" dur="4.679">noticed this old man continued to look</text>
  <text start="160.13" dur="4.71">at our table his eyes not filled with</text>
  <text start="162.799" dur="4.53">anger were instead filled with wide-eyed</text>
  <text start="164.84" dur="4.77">amazement he seemed to be listening to</text>
  <text start="167.329" dur="4.201">our conversation very intently as I laid</text>
  <text start="169.61" dur="5.28">out how the Torah and Messiah Yahshua</text>
  <text start="171.53" dur="4.98">were a seamless whole by the time we</text>
  <text start="174.89" dur="3.659">gathered our things to leave and set our</text>
  <text start="176.51" dur="3.6">goodbyes to these students I noticed the</text>
  <text start="178.549" dur="4.051">old man sitting in the corner was</text>
  <text start="180.11" dur="5.77">smiling and I might have even seen the</text>
  <text start="182.6" dur="6.34">glisten of tears in his eyes</text>
  <text start="185.88" dur="5.34">driving east back into Arizona my wife</text>
  <text start="188.94" dur="4.59">and I recounted the intense week of UCLA</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="4.92">we had reached Christian students who</text>
  <text start="193.53" dur="4.56">were blown away by the Torah message we</text>
  <text start="196.14" dur="3.87">had reached Jews who for the first time</text>
  <text start="198.09" dur="4.17">heard a messiah that cherished the Torah</text>
  <text start="200.01" dur="4.53">and offered to wash their sins away with</text>
  <text start="202.26" dur="4.83">his blood atonement we&amp;#39;d even reached</text>
  <text start="204.54" dur="4.44">the Mennonites on one of our last days</text>
  <text start="207.09" dur="3.9">with the wealthy couple in upland the</text>
  <text start="208.98" dur="4.86">UCLA student newspaper had published an</text>
  <text start="210.99" dur="4.26">article about me handing the daily bruin</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="3.54">to them that read the article with</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="4.07">interest and became keenly fascinated</text>
  <text start="217.38" dur="4.47">with the blessings of obeying the Torah</text>

  <text start="253.14" dur="3.63">in a modest three-bedroom home situated</text>
  <text start="255.06" dur="4.38">on a lonely hill that overlooked the</text>

  <text start="259.44" dur="4.26">the house as the husband quietly led us</text>
  <text start="262.02" dur="3.87">through the home I noticed pictures of a</text>

  <text start="301.59" dur="4.2">college was so small that there were</text>
  <text start="303.389" dur="4.021">hardly any students outside and a cool</text>
  <text start="305.79" dur="3.379">wind also seemed to discourage people</text>
  <text start="307.41" dur="4.229">from venturing beyond the Student Union</text>
  <text start="309.169" dur="4.151">for hours each day I tried to draw a</text>

  <text start="330.24" dur="4.83">linoleum floors reminded me just how</text>
  <text start="332.43" dur="5.31">unpopulated this campus was especially</text>
  <text start="335.07" dur="4.86">at the end of the day as Annika took the</text>
