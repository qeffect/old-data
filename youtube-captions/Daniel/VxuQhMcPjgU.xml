  <text start="17.58" dur="5.34">felt impressed by yah by his spirit to</text>
  <text start="20.85" dur="5.339">read this article again because I think</text>
  <text start="22.92" dur="6.689">it&amp;#39;s so important and it&amp;#39;s about true</text>
  <text start="26.189" dur="8.941">teshuva versus pulse teshuva true</text>
  <text start="29.609" dur="7.251">repentance vs. false repentance if there</text>

  <text start="41.19" dur="5.43">fasting and prayer known as Yom Kippur</text>

  <text start="52.92" dur="4.29">couple years ago it is important for us</text>
  <text start="55.23" dur="4.41">to understand what tissue but really is</text>
  <text start="57.21" dur="4.349">as many have pointed out in other</text>
  <text start="59.64" dur="4.29">articles teshuva has a slightly</text>
  <text start="61.559" dur="4.951">different emphasis in meaning than the</text>
  <text start="63.93" dur="4.89">mirror English word repentance teshuva</text>
  <text start="66.51" dur="4.38">is not merely the act of recognizing</text>
  <text start="68.82" dur="4.56">when you are wrong and confessing these</text>
  <text start="70.89" dur="4.44">faults but it is also the even more</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="4.05">important act of ceasing to do that</text>
  <text start="75.33" dur="4.74">which you were doing wrong and making a</text>

  <text start="80.07" dur="5.22">deed I&amp;#39;d like to use to very finished</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="5.04">scriptural examples to show first what</text>
  <text start="85.29" dur="6.719">genuine teshuva is not and then what</text>
  <text start="88.47" dur="6.539">genuine toshiba really is in for Samuel</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="5.101">chapter 24 we read of how King David had</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="4.591">the chance to kill his arch-enemy Kings</text>
  <text start="97.11" dur="4.2">all however instead of doing this he</text>
  <text start="99.6" dur="4.049">refuses to touch Yas anointed and</text>
  <text start="101.31" dur="4.83">instead cuts off one of Sultan&amp;#39;s easy</text>
  <text start="103.649" dur="4.65">when Saul awakens and begins his search</text>
  <text start="106.14" dur="4.17">for David David shouts down to him from</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="5.371">a hilltop and the two have an amazing</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="5.099">verbal exchange from verses 16 to the</text>
  <text start="113.67" dur="4.47">end of the chapter saw responds to</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="5.791">David&amp;#39;s incredible act of mercy Saul</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="4.769">says number one that David is his son a</text>
  <text start="121.2" dur="4.559">term of affection and starts to week</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="5.671">number two he says David is more</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="5.25">righteous than himself number three Saul</text>
  <text start="128.58" dur="4.2">confesses to his evil doing toward David</text>
  <text start="131.009" dur="4.081">number four</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="5.1">all praise for yahweh to bless david and</text>
  <text start="135.09" dur="5.82">number five Saul proclaims that David</text>

  <text start="140.91" dur="5.07">claims that the Kingdom of Israel will</text>
  <text start="142.41" dur="5.58">be established in David&amp;#39;s hint now after</text>
  <text start="145.98" dur="4.05">saying all these things why does David</text>
  <text start="147.99" dur="4.59">still not choose to come down off the</text>
  <text start="150.03" dur="4.98">hill top and join saw in returning to</text>
  <text start="152.58" dur="4.52">the kingdom after all does not solve</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="4.92">show genuine repentance by weeping</text>
  <text start="157.1" dur="5.65">extolling David confessing his own evil</text>
  <text start="159.93" dur="4.38">asking you to bless david and proclaim</text>
  <text start="162.75" dur="4.11">that david will replace him as king</text>
  <text start="164.31" dur="4.98">while this certainly looked like genuine</text>
  <text start="166.86" dur="5.9">and heartfelt to Shuba David recognized</text>
  <text start="169.29" dur="6.18">that saw had not repented all and why</text>
  <text start="172.76" dur="5.53">because of the very last thing Saul says</text>
  <text start="175.47" dur="5.34">he demands David to swear that he&amp;#39;ll not</text>
  <text start="178.29" dur="4.71">cut off his seed and he will not destroy</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="4.74">Saul&amp;#39;s name out of his father&amp;#39;s house in</text>
  <text start="183" dur="4.59">the end after all the weeping and</text>
  <text start="185.55" dur="4.8">confessing and extolling and blessing</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="5.88">and proclamations saw is still primarily</text>
  <text start="190.35" dur="6.29">interested in himself in his own aim and</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="3.17">in his legacy</text>
  <text start="201.94" dur="5.79">true teshuva a repentance consists of as</text>
  <text start="204.94" dur="5.25">Messiah said denying the self and</text>
  <text start="207.73" dur="5.82">turning away from all selfishness in an</text>
  <text start="210.19" dur="4.95">act of total surrender to Yahweh if Saul</text>
  <text start="213.55" dur="3.72">had truly repented he would not have</text>
  <text start="215.14" dur="4.38">even mentioned much less considers own</text>
  <text start="217.27" dur="4.23">legacy in his own name but rather would</text>
  <text start="219.52" dur="4.44">have offered to help establish David on</text>
  <text start="221.5" dur="4.44">his throne if Saul truly believed in</text>
  <text start="223.96" dur="3.96">David&amp;#39;s mercy he would have proven this</text>
  <text start="225.94" dur="4.32">through action and trusted in David to</text>
  <text start="227.92" dur="4.02">act with nobility and integrity by</text>
  <text start="230.26" dur="4.14">moving to preserve Saul&amp;#39;s name a</text>
  <text start="231.94" dur="4.05">peaceful transition of power might have</text>
  <text start="234.4" dur="4.35">been occurred between the house of Saul</text>
  <text start="235.99" dur="5.43">and Nelson David and much bloodshed and</text>
  <text start="238.75" dur="4.95">death might have been averted but in the</text>
  <text start="241.42" dur="4.5">end Saul still was primarily in love</text>
  <text start="243.7" dur="4.29">with himself looking out for himself to</text>
  <text start="245.92" dur="4.44">the exclusion of everyone else and this</text>
  <text start="247.99" dur="4.11">would prove true ass all later continued</text>
  <text start="250.36" dur="4.41">refused to relinquish his throne to</text>
  <text start="252.1" dur="4.109">David indeed yah would be forced to send</text>
  <text start="254.77" dur="3.689">an invading army that would not only</text>
  <text start="256.209" dur="4.65">take his life but that of his innocent</text>
  <text start="258.459" dur="5.101">son Jonathan before David could start</text>
  <text start="260.859" dur="4.021">step into his destiny of kingship even</text>
  <text start="263.56" dur="3.42">then it would be another seven years</text>
  <text start="264.88" dur="4.2">before the rest of Israel still loyal to</text>
  <text start="266.98" dur="4.83">the house of Saul would eventually fall</text>
  <text start="269.08" dur="5.01">under david&amp;#39;s rain all this caused by</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="6.6">man who while pretending to do teshuva</text>
  <text start="274.09" dur="6.12">in fact did not this scripturally proved</text>
  <text start="278.41" dur="4.95">to us that while a person may weep and</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="5.459">cry may confess to wrongdoing may bless</text>
  <text start="283.36" dur="4.35">others with his tongue and worship yah</text>
  <text start="285.669" dur="4.621">this does not mean he is actually</text>
  <text start="287.71" dur="4.53">repented the person must not only</text>
  <text start="290.29" dur="4.29">confessed to his wrong but he must</text>
  <text start="292.24" dur="4.53">totally turn away from his wrongdoing</text>
  <text start="294.58" dur="4.89">and go into a completely different</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="5.73">direction something saw never chose to</text>
  <text start="299.47" dur="6.57">do only then is to Shuba complete and</text>
  <text start="302.5" dur="5.91">genuine when I was open air preaching at</text>
  <text start="306.04" dur="5.04">a campus in Oklahoma several years ago a</text>
  <text start="308.41" dur="4.23">young woman began weeping but the Spirit</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="3.3">spoke to me and said she had not truly</text>
  <text start="312.64" dur="3.99">repented but was just crying for show</text>
  <text start="314.38" dur="4.23">perhaps to impress those around her who</text>
  <text start="316.63" dur="4.47">immediately based upon her tears reached</text>
  <text start="318.61" dur="4.2">out to and solar I saw right through her</text>
  <text start="321.1" dur="4.53">mask at the aid of the Holy Spirit and</text>
  <text start="322.81" dur="5.28">rebuked her she instantly stopped crying</text>
  <text start="325.63" dur="6.289">and snarled at me proving that she was</text>
  <text start="328.09" dur="3.829">indeed not repentant at all</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="4.689">people are very good at acting wearing</text>
  <text start="335.09" dur="3.99">masks pretending to do things while</text>
  <text start="337.129" dur="5.371">harboring opposite intentions in their</text>
  <text start="339.08" dur="6.03">heart so what is genuine and true to</text>
  <text start="342.5" dur="4.86">Shuba well one of the best examples of</text>
  <text start="345.11" dur="4.649">real repentance is when Jonah is sitting</text>
  <text start="347.36" dur="5.04">in the belly of a whale in Jonah chapter</text>
  <text start="349.759" dur="4.861">two outer Jonah had disobeyed Yahweh by</text>
  <text start="352.4" dur="4.979">fleeing from Nineveh Jonah cries out to</text>
  <text start="354.62" dur="5.22">yacht and says number one he cries out</text>
  <text start="357.379" dur="5.07">because of his collection number two he</text>
  <text start="359.84" dur="4.859">declares yah here&amp;#39;s his cry number three</text>
  <text start="362.449" dur="4.71">he declares how yah has punished him</text>
  <text start="364.699" dur="4.231">number four he says that even though he</text>
  <text start="367.159" dur="4.831">is cast from you outside he will yet</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="4.95">again look toward Yas holy temple number</text>
  <text start="371.99" dur="4.019">five he says that even though he has</text>
  <text start="373.88" dur="3.59">come under severe judgment yah has</text>
  <text start="376.009" dur="4.47">brought up his life from corruption</text>
  <text start="377.47" dur="5.259">number six he remembers yah and praise</text>
  <text start="380.479" dur="4.41">to him number seven he offers</text>
  <text start="382.729" dur="4.981">Thanksgiving toward yah and number eight</text>
  <text start="384.889" dur="5.821">he promises to fulfill the very vows he</text>
  <text start="387.71" dur="4.079">is broken here Jonah deep in the heart</text>
  <text start="390.71" dur="3.62">of the whale could have very easily</text>
  <text start="391.789" dur="5.491">fallen into self-pity and despair</text>
  <text start="394.33" dur="4.929">continuing in his selfishness instead he</text>
  <text start="397.28" dur="4.68">cries out to yah having the faith that</text>
  <text start="399.259" dur="4.65">y&amp;#39;all will hear him despite his previous</text>
  <text start="401.96" dur="4.259">disobedience and his current state of</text>
  <text start="403.909" dur="5.16">judgment he has the faith to say that he</text>
  <text start="406.219" dur="5.491">will see ya&amp;#39;s temple again he places his</text>
  <text start="409.069" dur="5.16">faith and hope in yo salvation and mercy</text>
  <text start="411.71" dur="4.94">he thanks y&amp;#39;all even while in the well</text>
  <text start="414.229" dur="4.711">and then he swears to perform his vows</text>
  <text start="416.65" dur="3.669">namely to do that which yah had</text>
  <text start="418.94" dur="4.68">commanded him to do from the beginning</text>
  <text start="420.319" dur="5.82">this last act his promise to perform his</text>
  <text start="423.62" dur="4.859">vows is the act of turning away from his</text>
  <text start="426.139" dur="5.31">wrongdoing and going in a completely new</text>
  <text start="428.479" dur="5.22">direction this is genuine to Shuba and</text>
  <text start="431.449" dur="4.231">this is why yah commands the whale to</text>
  <text start="433.699" dur="4.861">spit out Jonah and delivers him from</text>
  <text start="435.68" dur="5.22">judgment it is important to remember</text>
  <text start="438.56" dur="4.68">that genuine teshuva also includes a</text>
  <text start="440.9" dur="4.889">long-term day-to-day heart commitment</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="4.799">toward obedience to yah repentance of</text>
  <text start="445.789" dur="4.171">anything the Spirit is convicting of us</text>
  <text start="448.039" dur="4.62">to change and pressing toward the mark</text>
  <text start="449.96" dur="4.709">of perfection and maturity obviously</text>
  <text start="452.659" dur="4.681">while Jonah&amp;#39;s act is a great example of</text>
  <text start="454.669" dur="4.92">a one-time act genuine repentance he</text>
  <text start="457.34" dur="5.819">later falls short in maintaining it as a</text>
  <text start="459.589" dur="5.401">long-term walk on this Yom Kippur make</text>
  <text start="463.159" dur="3.63">sure you understand what true and</text>
  <text start="464.99" dur="4.38">lasting repentance is all about</text>
  <text start="466.789" dur="4.891">repentance is not merely confessing or</text>
  <text start="469.37" dur="4.769">display of emotions or a mental assent</text>
  <text start="471.68" dur="4.739">to yas will in your life repentance is</text>
  <text start="474.139" dur="4.411">an act of the will totally turning away</text>
  <text start="476.419" dur="5.131">from selfishness and surrendering to the</text>
  <text start="478.55" dur="5.16">Messiah have a very blessed Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="481.55" dur="6.419">and I just want to add to this article</text>
  <text start="483.71" dur="6.389">for 2013 that the only way that possible</text>
  <text start="487.969" dur="4.95">true complete and total teshuva</text>
  <text start="490.099" dur="5.25">repentance is possible is through Yeshua</text>
  <text start="492.919" dur="4.401">it is through realizing what he did on</text>
  <text start="495.349" dur="4.171">that steak dying for our sins</text>
  <text start="497.32" dur="4.48">resurrecting again on the third day our</text>
