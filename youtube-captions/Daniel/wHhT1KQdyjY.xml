  <text start="54.27" dur="4.559">missing and this issue is what leaves me</text>

  <text start="118.229" dur="3.24">Shiva</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="4.259">very good question so although the</text>
  <text start="121.469" dur="3.571">sighting of the crescent moon was a post</text>
  <text start="123.149" dur="4.08">Babylonian practice mentioned only in</text>
  <text start="125.04" dur="4.919">what later became codified as the Talmud</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="3.491">in the 13th century AD I want you to</text>
  <text start="129.959" dur="2.711">notice something</text>
  <text start="130.72" dur="3.87">throughout history both in ancient</text>
  <text start="132.67" dur="4.38">Israel and in the quote-unquote church</text>
  <text start="134.59" dur="4.74">history of the past 2,000 years you will</text>
  <text start="137.05" dur="4.08">see times when revival hit Yas people</text>
  <text start="139.33" dur="4.08">and they first took their traditions of</text>
  <text start="141.13" dur="4.11">men and cleave diyaa oftentimes has</text>
  <text start="143.41" dur="3.9">happened because he sent fiery pillars</text>
  <text start="145.24" dur="4.35">of men baptized in prayer and his word</text>
  <text start="147.31" dur="4.98">who brought a clarion call to his people</text>
  <text start="149.59" dur="4.5">in the early 1st century I believe yoga</text>
  <text start="152.29" dur="4.11">Don the immerser John the Baptist was</text>
  <text start="154.09" dur="4.62">sent to bring just such a revival to</text>
  <text start="156.4" dur="4.2">prepare the way for Yahshua now of</text>
  <text start="158.71" dur="3.69">course the leadership still maintained</text>
  <text start="160.6" dur="4.11">many of their wicked man-made traditions</text>
  <text start="162.4" dur="3.57">however you will notice in the Gospel</text>
  <text start="164.71" dur="4.08">accounts that the Sadducees and</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="4.77">Pharisees kept the exact same calendar</text>
  <text start="168.79" dur="4.11">though they differed much on many</text>
  <text start="170.74" dur="3.81">doctrines due to the Roman rule</text>
  <text start="172.9" dur="4.32">preventing the Sanhedrin from doing much</text>
  <text start="174.55" dur="4.56">of Torah such as stoning laws etc the</text>
  <text start="177.22" dur="3.45">habit of sending out two witnesses to</text>
  <text start="179.11" dur="3.87">site the first Crescent of the new moon</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="4.71">was not being done the combination of</text>
  <text start="182.98" dur="4.26">the spirit of Elijah on John the Roman</text>
  <text start="185.38" dur="3.3">rule and the time of revival that hit</text>
  <text start="187.24" dur="3.48">Israel to prepare their hearts from</text>
  <text start="188.68" dur="3.81">Messiah caused him to repent of the</text>
  <text start="190.72" dur="3.21">Babylonian man-made tradition of citing</text>
  <text start="192.49" dur="4.11">the first president and to follow</text>
  <text start="193.93" dur="5.309">conjunction as Torah clearly teaches how</text>
  <text start="196.6" dur="4.47">do I know this the records of sighting</text>
  <text start="199.239" dur="4.591">the Crescent are only founded was now</text>
  <text start="201.07" dur="5.07">known as the Talmud this Talmud was not</text>
  <text start="203.83" dur="5.31">actually codified until the 13th century</text>
  <text start="206.14" dur="5.49">some twelve hundred years after Messiah</text>
  <text start="209.14" dur="4.77">walked the earth therefore everything we</text>
  <text start="211.63" dur="4.29">read in the Talmud is over 1,000 years</text>
  <text start="213.91" dur="4.77">removed from what the Jews actually</text>
  <text start="215.92" dur="4.14">practiced in the first century now we</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="3.24">know from the Gospel accounts that</text>
  <text start="220.06" dur="4.11">obviously the leadership were doing many</text>
  <text start="221.92" dur="4.62">of the vain traditions found in Talmud</text>
  <text start="224.17" dur="4.289">but just the fact that all major sects</text>
  <text start="226.54" dur="4.05">of first century Judaism were all</text>
  <text start="228.459" dur="4.651">following the same calendar per the</text>
  <text start="230.59" dur="5.1">Gospel accounts and my mind convinces me</text>
  <text start="233.11" dur="5.25">they had during that period returned to</text>
  <text start="235.69" dur="4.62">this true scriptural determination of</text>
  <text start="238.36" dur="4.32">the new moon which was at conjunction</text>
  <text start="240.31" dur="4.709">and this is why Yahshua never had to</text>
  <text start="242.68" dur="5.24">rebuke them for this I hope this makes</text>
  <text start="245.019" dur="7.291">sense have a happy - and yom teruah</text>
