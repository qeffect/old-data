  <text start="58.8" dur="4.529">both of these letters contain a lot of</text>
  <text start="61.05" dur="3.96">reference to the end times too when the</text>
  <text start="63.329" dur="3.571">Antichrist comes and divided the dump</text>
  <text start="65.01" dur="3.51">wondered when Yahshua returns with the</text>
  <text start="66.9" dur="3.81">brightness of his coming and destroys</text>
  <text start="68.52" dur="3.87">the wicked one so he is our soon coming</text>
  <text start="70.71" dur="3.72">King written to the Thessalonians 2 at</text>
  <text start="72.39" dur="4.08">that time we&amp;#39;re going through quite a</text>
  <text start="74.43" dur="6.81">bit of persecution so polish trying to</text>
  <text start="76.47" dur="12.539">encourage them and the books first and</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="13.83">second Timothy he is our great mediator</text>
  <text start="89.009" dur="8.4">of course we read about you read about</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="4.95">in these books how he is the sole</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="5.721">mediator between us and the father and</text>
  <text start="100.02" dur="9.24">that he&amp;#39;s our his irate meteor he is her</text>
  <text start="103.13" dur="14.74">he is the one who prays for us</text>
  <text start="109.26" dur="12.42">the guy blows in Titus and tight as he</text>
  <text start="117.87" dur="11.16">shows us that grace grace equals the</text>
  <text start="121.68" dur="9.78">power to obey his fork and in Titus</text>
  <text start="129.03" dur="5.88">chapter 2 grace is actually defined</text>
  <text start="131.46" dur="4.68">grace very says he teaches us to live</text>
  <text start="134.91" dur="3.81">righteously you cast away all</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="4.89">unrighteousness and to obey according to</text>
  <text start="138.72" dur="5.58">his word and so we see the races that</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="6">power to obey his word that&amp;#39;s why he</text>
  <text start="144.3" dur="4.26">gives us grace again grace the whole</text>
  <text start="147.03" dur="3.78">concept of grace is often misunderstood</text>
  <text start="148.56" dur="3.81">in the Christian world but that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="150.81" dur="7.7">graces actually find right there and</text>
  <text start="152.37" dur="9.78">deliver Titus in the book of the long</text>
  <text start="158.51" dur="9.699">are you pronounce that gleeman long</text>
  <text start="162.15" dur="13.13">Philip Felina infil even he is our</text>
  <text start="168.209" dur="7.071">friend who sticks closer than a brother</text>
  <text start="177.47" dur="13.36">if we remember the book of women Paul is</text>
  <text start="183.45" dur="9.39">writing that slave set free because he</text>
  <text start="190.83" dur="4.35">was such a close friend a good friend on</text>
  <text start="192.84" dur="6.74">health called you sick and so he pleads</text>
  <text start="195.18" dur="7.77">with filament the releases slave and</text>
  <text start="199.58" dur="6.43">just really highlights the power of how</text>
  <text start="202.95" dur="4.98">close a friend called on this man be so</text>
  <text start="206.01" dur="5.33">I think that that just shows how good a</text>
  <text start="207.93" dur="3.41">friend that Yahshua is to us</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="14.38">hey then we come to Hebrews and he</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="10.71">bruises kind of Jersey one he is super</text>
  <text start="232.25" dur="7.41">yeah he is the blood of the everlasting</text>
  <text start="235.94" dur="7.86">covenant of course all through all</text>
  <text start="239.66" dur="6.21">through Hebrews it talks about it talks</text>
  <text start="243.8" dur="5.34">about that first tabernacle and talks</text>
  <text start="245.87" dur="4.62">about the employees of the blood the</text>
  <text start="249.14" dur="2.67">shedding of blood without showing of</text>
  <text start="250.49" dur="3.69">love there can be no remission of sins</text>
  <text start="251.81" dur="4.44">and then ties that into Joshua shed</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="4.34">blood him what he did and ties that into</text>
  <text start="256.25" dur="6.36">the everlasting covenant that were under</text>
  <text start="258.52" dur="6.19">so Hebrews is all about how he shed that</text>
  <text start="262.61" dur="9.93">blood for us to bring us into covenant</text>
  <text start="264.71" dur="16.29">with him in the book of James he is the</text>
  <text start="272.54" dur="12.87">one who resists the proud and exalts</text>
  <text start="281" dur="7.65">Tommy that&amp;#39;s a theme all through that</text>
  <text start="285.41" dur="4.95">book a book really that teaches is how</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="3.21">to be humble teaches us how to sort of</text>
  <text start="290.36" dur="4.95">bridle on our tongues how to think</text>
  <text start="291.86" dur="5.22">before we speak how to live not trying</text>
  <text start="295.31" dur="4.14">to plan out our own lives but to rely on</text>
  <text start="297.08" dur="3.93">him and so the themed areas resisting</text>
  <text start="299.45" dur="2.97">the proud exaltasamba which is I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="301.01" dur="12.24">actually direct quote from the book of</text>
  <text start="302.42" dur="12.78">James in first and second here he is the</text>
  <text start="313.25" dur="5.81">disappoint or of the stopper and the</text>
  <text start="315.2" dur="3.86">vindicator of the faithful</text>
  <text start="320.73" dur="6.16">so if you remember you know Peter talks</text>
  <text start="325.21" dur="3.81">about in these two books he talks about</text>
  <text start="326.89" dur="3.69">how you know people are stopping they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.02" dur="4.2">saying look everything has continued</text>
  <text start="330.58" dur="5.16">since since our fathers and since the</text>
  <text start="333.22" dur="4.53">pianos everything is just the same he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="335.74" dur="3.66">never going to come and Peter this is</text>
  <text start="337.75" dur="4.41">but they are ignorant of the fact that</text>
  <text start="339.4" dur="4.17">at one point late in the past he covered</text>
  <text start="342.16" dur="3.15">the earth with floodwaters and now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.57" dur="4.95">going to come back and cover it with</text>
  <text start="345.31" dur="6.68">fire so he&amp;#39;s the disappointing of the</text>
  <text start="348.52" dur="14.04">stopper and The Vindicator of the finger</text>
  <text start="351.99" dur="16.45">in first second and third John he</text>
  <text start="362.56" dur="11.73">teaches us he teaches us to live without</text>
  <text start="368.44" dur="7.41">sin to burn her the love so brightly we</text>
  <text start="374.29" dur="6.75">dare not sin and that comes directly</text>
  <text start="375.85" dur="7.59">from first John 3 6 through 11 which</text>
  <text start="381.04" dur="4.56">talks about how through him and by</text>
  <text start="383.44" dur="3.48">keeping our eyes on him and being</text>
  <text start="385.6" dur="4.56">depended on him we can actually live</text>
  <text start="386.92" dur="5.85">without sin we can actually overcome sin</text>
  <text start="390.16" dur="4.95">and live a holy pure life only through</text>
  <text start="392.77" dur="4.11">him of course if we should happen to</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="3.75">send god forbid but we should happen to</text>
  <text start="396.88" dur="5.73">send we have him as our mediator but</text>
  <text start="398.86" dur="7.02">really John is dealing with a gnostic</text>
  <text start="402.61" dur="4.65">set that was teaching that your spirit</text>
  <text start="405.88" dur="4.05">man was in heaven and so your flesh</text>
  <text start="407.26" dur="4.59">could cinahl at one and so John to</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="3.87">combat that Gnosticism that was starting</text>
  <text start="411.85" dur="3.48">to pervade the early church he said no</text>
  <text start="413.8" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s not what that&amp;#39;s not the Messiah</text>
  <text start="415.33" dur="4.2">says he wants us to live holy here now</text>
  <text start="417.13" dur="5.34">he wants us to resist sin here now and</text>
  <text start="419.53" dur="4.31">we can do that if we stay dependent on</text>
  <text start="422.47" dur="3.57">him and so the whole theme is</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="6.96">encouraging us that we can live without</text>
  <text start="426.04" dur="4.76">sin of course we can only do it through</text>
  <text start="433.96" dur="19.71">and then finding so look at Jude he is</text>
  <text start="446.99" dur="16.22">the king coming is the King coming with</text>
  <text start="453.67" dur="9.54">ten thousand ten thousands of his Saints</text>
  <text start="464.41" dur="6.97">to destroy the wake so Jude we read</text>
  <text start="469.7" dur="5.01">about that prophecy that is attributed</text>
  <text start="471.38" dur="5.61">to Enoch which talks about a second</text>
  <text start="474.71" dur="4.71">coming talktalk we will read about in</text>
  <text start="476.99" dur="4.29">Revelation 19 out he will return with</text>
  <text start="479.42" dur="3.93">this resurrected Saints and with his</text>
  <text start="481.28" dur="4.89">army of angels to destroy the wicked and</text>
  <text start="483.35" dur="6.96">then take to take a kind of rulership</text>
  <text start="486.17" dur="8.88">over the earth and then finally we come</text>
  <text start="490.31" dur="11.03">to the book of Revelation and revelation</text>
  <text start="495.05" dur="6.29">he is the first on the last</text>
  <text start="503.389" dur="14.59">The Aleph in the total king of kings all</text>
  <text start="515.849" dur="4.05">about his second coming his rule on</text>
  <text start="517.979" dur="5.131">earth 4,000 years and of course the new</text>
  <text start="519.899" dur="5.94">heavens and new earth so obviously</text>
  <text start="523.11" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s probably other teens and aspects</text>
  <text start="525.839" dur="3.421">that you can get out of every book this</text>
  <text start="527.1" dur="4.109">was just my version of it but I think</text>
  <text start="529.26" dur="4.17">you can see how every single book in the</text>
  <text start="531.209" dur="3.99">Bible called statistics books they all</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="4.409">points for Messiah and I&amp;#39;ll point word</text>
  <text start="535.199" dur="4.88">for it and they&amp;#39;re all in some way of</text>
  <text start="537.839" dur="5.281">showing us an aspect of who he is or</text>
  <text start="540.079" dur="5.651">showing us an aspect of how we can obey</text>
  <text start="543.12" dur="7.159">fora how it release at or up or to the</text>
  <text start="545.73" dur="4.549">Messiah that&amp;#39;s it</text>
