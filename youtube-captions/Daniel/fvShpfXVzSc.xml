  <text start="0" dur="4.2">and this forms from so I mentioned to</text>
  <text start="2.85" dur="2.79">you guys that the rocks are made of</text>
  <text start="4.2" dur="3.27">minerals and then the minerals are made</text>
  <text start="5.64" dur="3.33">of elements does anyone happen to know</text>
  <text start="7.47" dur="4.56">which elements make up the mineral</text>
  <text start="8.97" dur="8.76">calcite it&amp;#39;s okay to guess no calcium</text>
  <text start="12.03" dur="8.19">great just need calcium carbide yeah</text>
  <text start="17.73" dur="5.129">that&amp;#39;s exactly right good job calcium</text>
  <text start="20.22" dur="5.12">carbonate is the name of calcite so it</text>
  <text start="22.859" dur="5.58">forms at the bottom of an ocean about</text>
  <text start="25.34" dur="5.41">240 million years ago there was a ocean</text>
  <text start="28.439" dur="4.32">and of course with many ocean there sea</text>
  <text start="30.75" dur="3.78">creatures in it and as they die they</text>
  <text start="32.759" dur="4.351">settle to the bottom of the ocean and</text>
  <text start="34.53" dur="4.95">there if you can imagine their skeletons</text>
  <text start="37.11" dur="4.019">and exoskeletons make up the calcium</text>
  <text start="39.48" dur="4.2">their bodies make up the carbonate</text>
  <text start="41.129" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s how we get our calcium carbonate</text>
  <text start="43.68" dur="4.26">in the rock here and you guys notice</text>
  <text start="46.289" dur="3.93">these black bands in the rock as well</text>
  <text start="47.94" dur="4.41">these are graphite that&amp;#39;s a different</text>
  <text start="50.219" dur="4.32">type of mineral and if it&amp;#39;s mostly</text>
  <text start="52.35" dur="3.81">carbon and we believe these formed from</text>
  <text start="54.539" dur="5.881">algae mats that we&amp;#39;re settling to the</text>
  <text start="56.16" dur="5.82">bottom of the ocean as well cap exactly</text>
  <text start="60.42" dur="3.87">yeah some pencils are made of graphite</text>
  <text start="61.98" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s right especially of the pencils</text>
  <text start="64.29" dur="5.009">that artists use graphite pencils so</text>
  <text start="66.51" dur="5.24">definitely and that&amp;#39;s the exact same</text>
  <text start="69.299" dur="2.451">stuff</text>
