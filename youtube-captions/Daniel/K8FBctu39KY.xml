  <text start="23.789" dur="10.141">go through chapter 3 4 and 5 behold what</text>
  <text start="32.399" dur="3.631">manner of love the father has bestowed</text>
  <text start="33.93" dur="5.55">upon us that we should be called the</text>
  <text start="36.03" dur="7.529">sons of yah therefore the world knows us</text>
  <text start="39.48" dur="5.88">not because it knew him not so this</text>
  <text start="43.559" dur="4.921">harkens back to that whole principle</text>
  <text start="45.36" dur="5.039">about you know if they hate me they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="3.059">also going to hate you and in the same</text>
  <text start="50.399" dur="2.43">way that they don&amp;#39;t know me they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="51.539" dur="5.221">even understand me they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>

  <text start="63.449" dur="5.071">him for we shall see him as he is so of</text>
  <text start="66.63" dur="4.77">course this is referring to the rapture</text>
  <text start="68.52" dur="4.83">the resurrection day yummm through 2017</text>
  <text start="71.4" dur="4.68">when we will finally behold Joshua and</text>
  <text start="73.35" dur="5.04">the fullness of his glory and notice how</text>
  <text start="76.08" dur="4.109">John says that we&amp;#39;re right now we are</text>
  <text start="78.39" dur="3.9">the sons of yah were the sons and</text>
  <text start="80.189" dur="3.841">daughters of yah it just hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="82.29" dur="3.54">made manifest yet that hasn&amp;#39;t been made</text>
  <text start="84.03" dur="5.729">manifest yet and it will be will be made</text>
  <text start="85.83" dur="6.179">manifest on that day and every man that</text>
  <text start="89.759" dur="4.86">hath his hope in him purifies himself</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="5.191">even as he is pure so having this hope</text>
  <text start="94.619" dur="4.771">knowing that we not only our sons of</text>
  <text start="97.2" dur="5.4">yacht right now and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="4.86">made manifest in fact just a little over</text>
  <text start="102.6" dur="3.299">for a little under four years from now</text>
  <text start="104.25" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s gonna be made manifest having this</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="4.591">hope literally enables us to purify</text>
  <text start="108.42" dur="5.22">ourselves this is why Paul says in 1st</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="4.98">Thessalonians 4 when he describes the</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="3.15">resurrection the first resurrection the</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="3.149">what the Christians call the rapture he</text>
  <text start="116.79" dur="7.619">says wherefore comfort one another with</text>
  <text start="118.619" dur="8.011">these words hmm because these words help</text>
  <text start="124.409" dur="4.701">to purify us when we think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="2.48">going to happen</text>
  <text start="130.65" dur="5.86">verse for whosoever commits sin</text>
  <text start="133.29" dur="4.69">transgresses also the Torah for sin is</text>
  <text start="136.51" dur="3.36">the transgression of Torah so right</text>
  <text start="137.98" dur="4.1">there we have a very clear definition in</text>
  <text start="139.87" dur="5.82">the New Testament that sin equals</text>
  <text start="142.08" dur="5.41">transgressing the Torah now what if</text>
  <text start="145.69" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;re a believer your brand new</text>
  <text start="147.49" dur="2.82">believer and you don&amp;#39;t know about the</text>
  <text start="148.93" dur="3.39">flora ok you don&amp;#39;t know anything about</text>
  <text start="150.31" dur="4.35">the tour but your heart is pure well</text>
  <text start="152.32" dur="3.57">Paul addresses that in first drink in</text>
  <text start="154.66" dur="3.36">Romans where he says that without</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="5.43">knowledge of the tour there can be no</text>
  <text start="158.02" dur="5.1">sin okay so of course there&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="161.32" dur="3.87">process that we all go through called</text>
  <text start="163.12" dur="3.33">sanctification where we learn about the</text>
  <text start="165.19" dur="4.38">scriptures and then we apply it to our</text>
  <text start="166.45" dur="5.31">lives and then we grow thereby but the</text>
  <text start="169.57" dur="4.23">fact of the matter is this that once we</text>
  <text start="171.76" dur="5.1">understand and learn the Torah and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="173.8" dur="5.13">not doing it that is sin okay so sin is</text>
  <text start="176.86" dur="3.81">quite simply in any way that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="178.93" dur="5.43">trying to rest in the Torah that we that</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="6.45">we know about and you know that he was</text>
  <text start="184.36" dur="4.74">manifested to take away our sins and in</text>
  <text start="187.12" dur="5.82">him is no sin so the whole point of why</text>
  <text start="189.1" dur="5.94">Yahshua came was to shed his blood so</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="3.78">that we would no longer be subject to</text>
  <text start="195.04" dur="4.32">our past sins which is nothing we can do</text>
  <text start="196.72" dur="7.32">about but he can he can take those</text>
  <text start="199.36" dur="7.59">things away and he takes those sins away</text>
  <text start="204.04" dur="8.729">because in him is no sin he takes these</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="8.7">transgressions away and then it says in</text>
  <text start="212.769" dur="5.97">verse 6 whosoever abides in yahshua sins</text>
  <text start="215.65" dur="6.42">not whosoever sins has not seen him</text>
  <text start="218.739" dur="5.011">neither known him so what happens after</text>
  <text start="222.07" dur="3.419">we come to repentance we are then as</text>
  <text start="223.75" dur="5.519">what Yahshua said often the Gospels</text>
  <text start="225.489" dur="4.951">abide in me that I might abided you you</text>
  <text start="229.269" dur="3.301">know I am the vine you are the branches</text>
  <text start="230.44" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re supposed to abide in him and we do</text>
  <text start="232.57" dur="5.52">this on a daily basis and as we abide in</text>
  <text start="235.12" dur="4.77">him we will not sin we will not</text>
  <text start="238.09" dur="3.36">transgress the Torah we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="239.89" dur="3.21">continued to learn more about the tour</text>
  <text start="241.45" dur="4.91">and as we learn about it were quick to</text>
  <text start="243.1" dur="3.26">implement it in our lives</text>
  <text start="246.75" dur="6.37">so whosoever abides in him sins not</text>
  <text start="250.439" dur="4.991">whosoever sins has not seen uh neither</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="3.78">known him so if someone says they love</text>
  <text start="255.43" dur="2.72">Jesus or they going to church with their</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="4.23">current avaiable and yet they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="4.09">sinning they&amp;#39;re still breaking the</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="3.629">things that they know they shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="262.24" dur="6.75">doing they don&amp;#39;t know yah they never met</text>
  <text start="264.759" dur="6.571">him little children let no man deceive</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="6.83">you he that does righteousness is</text>
  <text start="271.33" dur="7.44">righteous even as Yahshua is righteous</text>
  <text start="275.82" dur="5.02">that&amp;#39;s very very simple you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="278.77" dur="4.89">righteousness okay that proves that you</text>
  <text start="280.84" dur="5.04">are righteous even as yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.66" dur="3.87">righteous why because Yahshua lives in</text>
  <text start="285.88" dur="3.99">the center of your heart and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.53" dur="3.72">helping you to obey his commandments</text>
  <text start="289.87" dur="3.299">he&amp;#39;s teaching you to live righteously</text>
  <text start="291.25" dur="3.57">he&amp;#39;s teaching you and helping you do</text>
  <text start="293.169" dur="4.021">have those fruits of the spirit</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="6.99">abounding in your life and walking in</text>
  <text start="297.19" dur="6.27">His commandments see John wrote this by</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="3.84">the way he wrote the book of 1st John to</text>
  <text start="303.46" dur="4.26">combat this Gnostic heresy that was very</text>
  <text start="305.65" dur="3.84">prevalent in the latter half of the 1st</text>
  <text start="307.72" dur="4.919">century going into the 2nd century where</text>
  <text start="309.49" dur="5.34">these Gnostics were saying your spirit</text>
  <text start="312.639" dur="5.041">man is up in heaven and so your flesh</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="7.53">can just send all at once and John was</text>
  <text start="317.68" dur="7.799">writing against that he that commits sin</text>
  <text start="322.36" dur="4.38">is of the devil you keep breaking that</text>
  <text start="325.479" dur="4.141">which you know you&amp;#39;re not just be doing</text>
  <text start="326.74" dur="4.649">you keep walking in that you&amp;#39;re of the</text>
  <text start="329.62" dur="4.5">devil for the devil is sin for the</text>
  <text start="331.389" dur="4.53">beginning for this purpose the Son of</text>
  <text start="334.12" dur="4.169">yah was manifested that he might destroy</text>
  <text start="335.919" dur="4.47">the works of the devil so again we come</text>
  <text start="338.289" dur="4.171">back white right to the main one of the</text>
  <text start="340.389" dur="4.53">main reasons Joshua came to earth was to</text>
  <text start="342.46" dur="4.019">destroy these works in our lives so that</text>
  <text start="344.919" dur="4.231">we&amp;#39;re no longer walking as a child of</text>
  <text start="346.479" dur="6.151">the devil we&amp;#39;re now going to what verse</text>
  <text start="349.15" dur="6.12">9 says whosoever is born of yah does not</text>
  <text start="352.63" dur="5.219">commit sin that word commit if you look</text>
  <text start="355.27" dur="5.31">in the Greek it actually says whosoever</text>
  <text start="357.849" dur="6.171">is born of yaad does not commit a single</text>
  <text start="360.58" dur="3.44">act of sin</text>
  <text start="364.41" dur="6.49">for his seed remains in him and he</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="4.96">cannot sin because he&amp;#39;s born of yon you</text>
  <text start="370.9" dur="4.11">see you have the seed of the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="372.67" dur="3.42">growing within you we&amp;#39;re already sons of</text>
  <text start="375.01" dur="3.06">y&amp;#39;all though it hasn&amp;#39;t been made</text>
  <text start="376.09" dur="3.45">manifest yet until we resurrected but we</text>
  <text start="378.07" dur="5.67">have to see the Holy Spirit growing</text>
  <text start="379.54" dur="5.16">within us and because of this we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="3.18">going to send we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="384.7" dur="4.29">continue walking will Flint&amp;#39;s in we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="386.92" dur="6.99">gonna be walking holy loving y&amp;#39;all with</text>
  <text start="388.99" dur="7.11">everything in us verse 10 in this the</text>
  <text start="393.91" dur="4.2">children of yah are manifest and the</text>
  <text start="396.1" dur="4.23">children of the devil whosoever does not</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="4.35">righteousness is not of yah neither he</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="5.43">that loves not his brother so now we</text>
  <text start="402.46" dur="5.64">come to it even more this John breaks</text>
  <text start="405.76" dur="3.6">down even more he says look it this is</text>
  <text start="408.1" dur="3.81">the basic thing that we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="409.36" dur="4.17">here if you don&amp;#39;t have any love toward</text>
  <text start="411.91" dur="3.99">your brother you don&amp;#39;t have any love</text>
  <text start="413.53" dur="5.79">toward yah okay you&amp;#39;re a child of the</text>
  <text start="415.9" dur="5.52">devil but if that love does abound in</text>
  <text start="419.32" dur="3.87">you that love does it bound toward yah</text>
  <text start="421.42" dur="3.06">and towards your brother you&amp;#39;re born of</text>
  <text start="423.19" dur="4.44">yah and you&amp;#39;re not going to be walking</text>
  <text start="424.48" dur="6.54">in sin why because love is the very</text>
  <text start="427.63" dur="5.16">opposite thing of sin so sin is selfish</text>
  <text start="431.02" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s putting yourself about everyone</text>
  <text start="432.79" dur="4.05">else love is saying no I&amp;#39;m going to put</text>
  <text start="434.5" dur="5.73">y&amp;#39;all first and love my fellow man as as</text>
  <text start="436.84" dur="5.25">as I love myself so it&amp;#39;s going in the</text>
  <text start="440.23" dur="4.02">exact opposite direction of sin you</text>
  <text start="442.09" dur="3.69">can&amp;#39;t go into two opposite directions at</text>
  <text start="444.25" dur="5.06">the same time you&amp;#39;re either walking in</text>
  <text start="445.78" dur="5.7">selfishness or you&amp;#39;re walking in love</text>
  <text start="449.31" dur="3.46">for this is the message that you have</text>
  <text start="451.48" dur="2.79">heard from the beginning that we should</text>
  <text start="452.77" dur="3.6">love one another this is anything new</text>
  <text start="454.27" dur="4.53">this is from the very very beginning in</text>
  <text start="456.37" dur="5.549">fact now John&amp;#39;s going to go way back to</text>
  <text start="458.8" dur="5.94">the book of Genesis way back very</text>
  <text start="461.919" dur="4.831">beginning and says not as Cain who was</text>
  <text start="464.74" dur="5.33">of that wicked one and murdered his</text>
  <text start="466.75" dur="6.3">brother and why did Kane murder him</text>
  <text start="470.07" dur="5.349">because his own works were evil and his</text>
  <text start="473.05" dur="5.19">brothers were righteous he came hated</text>
  <text start="475.419" dur="4.651">the fact that Abel was was abounding in</text>
  <text start="478.24" dur="4.05">love and was walking and because of that</text>
  <text start="480.07" dur="5.13">was walking in Torah he was walking in</text>
  <text start="482.29" dur="5.28">righteousness he get Abel gave a</text>
  <text start="485.2" dur="4.469">sacrifice that was appropriate according</text>
  <text start="487.57" dur="4.38">to Torah because he loved you so much</text>
  <text start="489.669" dur="5.611">and he loved his neighbor and Cain hated</text>
  <text start="491.95" dur="4.899">that he hated that so he&amp;#39;d rather murder</text>
  <text start="495.28" dur="4.719">Abel and put</text>
  <text start="496.849" dur="5.43">death then actually repent himself and</text>
  <text start="499.999" dur="7.44">start walking in love and keeping the</text>
  <text start="502.279" dur="7.17">commandments remember Abel he gave a</text>
  <text start="507.439" dur="6.001">sacrifice that was appropriate a blood</text>
  <text start="509.449" dur="5.76">sacrifice that&amp;#39;s what Torah demands Cain</text>
  <text start="513.44" dur="3.99">wanted to do his own thing that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="515.209" dur="4.8">you submitted a bunch of vegetables and</text>
  <text start="517.43" dur="4.38">they knew that sacrifices had to be</text>
  <text start="520.009" dur="4.171">blood sacrifices by the way because when</text>
  <text start="521.81" dur="4.889">Adam and Eve first sinned what had to</text>
  <text start="524.18" dur="4.92">happen for them to be brought to</text>
  <text start="526.699" dur="6.12">repentance yah had to slay a lamb and</text>
  <text start="529.1" dur="5.849">cover them in lambskins so they knew</text>
  <text start="532.819" dur="4.231">they knew about what the prophet</text>
  <text start="534.949" dur="7.38">sacrifice was but Cain wanted to do his</text>
  <text start="537.05" dur="9.2">own thing and then when Abel did the</text>
  <text start="542.329" dur="6.45">right thing Cain hated it he hated it so</text>
  <text start="546.25" dur="3.91">not as Cain was of that wicked one and</text>
  <text start="548.779" dur="2.761">murdered his brother and why did he</text>
  <text start="550.16" dur="3.679">murder him because his own works were</text>
  <text start="551.54" dur="4.62">evil and his brothers were righteous</text>
  <text start="553.839" dur="4.69">Marvel not my brethren if the world</text>
  <text start="556.16" dur="4.14">hates you see when you abound and love</text>
  <text start="558.529" dur="4.711">towards yah and bounded up toward your</text>
  <text start="560.3" dur="4.95">neighbor and thus that love compels you</text>
  <text start="563.24" dur="3.81">to walk in the Torah to keep the</text>
  <text start="565.25" dur="3.899">commandments those who want to go their</text>
  <text start="567.05" dur="7.649">own way they begin to despise you hate</text>
  <text start="569.149" dur="6.99">you just like Cain hated able so don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="574.699" dur="2.7">be surprised if you get this type of</text>
  <text start="576.139" dur="3.961">hatred directed towards you this</text>
  <text start="577.399" dur="4.74">murderous hatred we know that we have</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="4.62">passed from death unto life because we</text>
  <text start="582.139" dur="6.87">love the Brethren he that loves not his</text>
  <text start="584.72" dur="7.02">brother abides in death again it all</text>
  <text start="589.009" dur="5.281">comes down to love and this is what I</text>
  <text start="591.74" dur="4.079">talked about last night is that the</text>
  <text start="594.29" dur="3.21">whole reason we&amp;#39;re able to keep and</text>
  <text start="595.819" dur="3.57">walked in the commandments is because</text>
  <text start="597.5" dur="8.03">love compels us we just want to put a</text>
  <text start="599.389" dur="8.161">smile on her daddy&amp;#39;s face hallelujah</text>
  <text start="605.53" dur="4.48">whosoever hates his brother is a</text>

  <text start="1016.76" dur="2.73">spirits really are from yah or not</text>
  <text start="1018.23" dur="2.9">because there are many false prophets</text>
  <text start="1019.49" dur="3.599">that are going out into the world and</text>
  <text start="1021.13" dur="3.76">he&amp;#39;s particularly addressing these</text>

  <text start="1041.63" dur="4.049">important by the way because the</text>
  <text start="1043.339" dur="3.961">Gnostics never believed that Yahshua was</text>
  <text start="1045.679" dur="3.511">actually in the flesh they just thought</text>

  <text start="1050.39" dur="3.51">eventually resurrected but the network</text>
  <text start="1052.4" dur="3.39">top that he was literally in the flesh</text>
  <text start="1053.9" dur="3.51">and it&amp;#39;s important to realize he was in</text>

  <text start="1099.41" dur="5.46">thing which you totally strip away the</text>
  <text start="1103.28" dur="3.54">essence of one of the reasons he came</text>
  <text start="1104.87" dur="3.42">again he came in the flesh because he</text>

  <text start="1896.97" dur="4.74">spirit of obedience or disobedience</text>
  <text start="1899.03" dur="5.83">you&amp;#39;re either walking the spirit of fear</text>
  <text start="1901.71" dur="5.19">or boldness and yawn you&amp;#39;re either have</text>
  <text start="1904.86" dur="5.67">the son living at the depth of who you</text>

  <text start="1915.15" dur="3.87">may believe on the name of the son of</text>
  <text start="1916.62" dur="4.14">yacht and this is the confidence that we</text>
  <text start="1919.02" dur="6.09">have in him that if we ask anything</text>
  <text start="1920.76" dur="6.24">according to his will he hears us and if</text>
  <text start="1925.11" dur="3.87">we know that he hear us whatsoever we</text>
  <text start="1927" dur="3.57">ask we know that we have the petitions</text>
  <text start="1928.98" dur="3.42">that we desire to them this is going</text>
  <text start="1930.57" dur="3.9">back to that previous verse but I read</text>
  <text start="1932.4" dur="3.69">in 1st John 3 basically if we&amp;#39;re filled</text>
  <text start="1934.47" dur="3.24">with the spirit then the things that we</text>
  <text start="1936.09" dur="3.209">ask of them will be according to his</text>
  <text start="1937.71" dur="3.54">will and so thus he will grant it to us</text>
  <text start="1939.299" dur="3.721">and our prayers constantly get answered</text>
  <text start="1941.25" dur="3.179">by the way that&amp;#39;s like an endless cycle</text>
  <text start="1943.02" dur="3.3">because then it builds our faith our</text>
  <text start="1944.429" dur="2.971">praise ganser builds our faith our</text>
  <text start="1946.32" dur="2.88">prayers get answered bills are fake</text>
  <text start="1947.4" dur="3.42">because we&amp;#39;re constantly praying for for</text>
  <text start="1949.2" dur="3.089">his will to be done in every different</text>
  <text start="1950.82" dur="3">situation why because we&amp;#39;re keeping</text>
  <text start="1952.289" dur="3.721">Commandments were full of the Spirit and</text>
  <text start="1953.82" dur="7.13">and we&amp;#39;re understanding the way he wants</text>
  <text start="1956.01" dur="4.94">us to go hmmm</text>
  <text start="1961.92" dur="4.21">verse 15 and if we know that he hear us</text>
  <text start="1964.57" dur="3.86">whatsoever we ask we know that we have</text>
  <text start="1966.13" dur="5.04">the petitions that we desired of him and</text>
  <text start="1968.43" dur="6.46">if any man sees his brother sinnis in</text>
  <text start="1971.17" dur="5.25">which is not unto death he shall ask and</text>
  <text start="1974.89" dur="3.18">he shall give him life for them that sin</text>
  <text start="1976.42" dur="5.07">not unto death there is a sin unto death</text>
  <text start="1978.07" dur="5.07">I do not say he shall pray for it so if</text>
  <text start="1981.49" dur="5.4">we see our brothers and sisters and</text>
  <text start="1983.14" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;ve fallen into sin okay that that</text>
  <text start="1986.89" dur="3.84">can be brought to repentance then we</text>
  <text start="1989.17" dur="2.97">need to be praying for them if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1990.73" dur="3.42">restored back to the state that need to</text>
  <text start="1992.14" dur="4.29">be in which is what John has labored on</text>
  <text start="1994.15" dur="4.98">so long about walking the spirit of</text>
  <text start="1996.43" dur="5.04">obedience but of course if they send us</text>
  <text start="1999.13" dur="3.86">in unto death which is that&amp;#39;s a whole</text>
  <text start="2001.47" dur="4.71">different subject but it&amp;#39;s a sin of</text>
  <text start="2002.99" dur="5.53">basically things of including blasphemy</text>
  <text start="2006.18" dur="3.24">of the Holy Spirit and reprobation and</text>
  <text start="2008.52" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;m not going to touch on that tonight</text>
  <text start="2009.42" dur="4.86">but eventually John is saying look when</text>
  <text start="2013.11" dur="2.55">we see our brothers and sisters of the</text>
  <text start="2014.28" dur="3.15">sin we really need to be praying for</text>
  <text start="2015.66" dur="3.21">them that they&amp;#39;re brought back into the</text>
  <text start="2017.43" dur="7.02">state that they need to be walking in</text>
  <text start="2018.87" dur="8.55">that state of obedience all</text>
  <text start="2024.45" dur="7.14">unrighteousness is sin and there is a</text>
  <text start="2027.42" dur="6.72">sin unto death we know that whosoever is</text>
  <text start="2031.59" dur="4.35">born of yah sins not but he that has</text>
  <text start="2034.14" dur="4.65">begotten of yah keeps himself and that</text>
  <text start="2035.94" dur="4.77">wicked one touches him not you see the</text>
  <text start="2038.79" dur="3.6">normal state of a believer is that the</text>
  <text start="2040.71" dur="4.98">wicked ones not able to get a foothold</text>
  <text start="2042.39" dur="5.04">in your life because you&amp;#39;re walking in</text>
  <text start="2045.69" dur="7.38">obedience you&amp;#39;re walking in the spirit</text>
  <text start="2047.43" dur="7.469">of yacht you keep yourself you keep your</text>
  <text start="2053.07" dur="4.41">keeping yourself faithful to the one</text>
  <text start="2054.899" dur="4.681">who&amp;#39;s redeemed you and we know that we</text>
  <text start="2057.48" dur="5.55">are of y&amp;#39;all and the whole world lies in</text>
  <text start="2059.58" dur="5.099">wickedness and we know that the son of</text>
  <text start="2063.03" dur="3.75">yacht has come and has given us an</text>
  <text start="2064.679" dur="4.291">understanding that we may know him that</text>
  <text start="2066.78" dur="5.1">is true and we are in him that is true</text>
  <text start="2068.97" dur="5.5">even in a son Yahshua HaMashiach this is</text>
  <text start="2071.88" dur="5.32">the true yacht and eternal life</text>
  <text start="2074.47" dur="5.97">little children keep yourselves from</text>
  <text start="2077.2" dur="6.36">idols see one of the things that happens</text>
  <text start="2080.44" dur="4.59">when believers start not walking in that</text>
  <text start="2083.56" dur="2.579">spirit of obedience but they start</text>
  <text start="2085.03" dur="2.31">getting into disobedience and then</text>
  <text start="2086.139" dur="3.151">justifying it through bad teaching</text>
  <text start="2087.34" dur="4.769">whatever eventually what it leads us to</text>
  <text start="2089.29" dur="5.04">idol worship it leads to idle it leads</text>
  <text start="2092.109" dur="3.721">to literally either saying that they</text>
  <text start="2094.33" dur="3.539">serve Jesus but it&amp;#39;s not the real jesus</text>
  <text start="2095.83" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s like an idol of Jesus that they</text>
  <text start="2097.869" dur="3.331">made in their own image or it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2099.79" dur="3">literally some other Idol that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2101.2" dur="3.99">making it the heart of their lives but</text>
  <text start="2102.79" dur="7.079">that&amp;#39;s what happens so that&amp;#39;s why John</text>
