  <text start="178.09" dur="5.13">Yahshua tells a parable involving money</text>
  <text start="180.069" dur="4.741">debt and forgiveness Yahshua uses money</text>
  <text start="183.22" dur="3.78">in this parable because Simon the</text>

  <text start="209.29" dur="5.4">in love with money and prestige he must</text>
  <text start="212.229" dur="4.32">have been a very high ranking Pharisee</text>
  <text start="214.69" dur="4.829">as he was trained at the feet of</text>

  <text start="229.03" dur="3.989">Iscariot unlike his cold-hearted and</text>
  <text start="230.949" dur="3.93">greedy and self-righteous father was a</text>
  <text start="233.019" dur="3.93">pure heart for you read in the Gospels</text>
  <text start="234.879" dur="4.411">at the beginning of yahshua&amp;#39;s ministry</text>
  <text start="236.949" dur="4.861">that all twelve disciples walked with</text>
  <text start="239.29" dur="4.979">Yahshua in one accord this means Judas</text>
  <text start="241.81" dur="5.039">Iscariot started out pure however</text>
  <text start="244.269" dur="4.11">something very bad happened Judas</text>
  <text start="246.849" dur="3.301">Iscariot influenced by his</text>
  <text start="248.379" dur="4.26">self-righteous proud and greedy father</text>
  <text start="250.15" dur="4.47">Simon the Pharisee decided that he would</text>
  <text start="252.639" dur="4.53">stop being a pure heart and indulge in</text>
  <text start="254.62" dur="4.349">some secrets in hiding his sin from the</text>
  <text start="257.169" dur="4.29">other eleven disciples Judas Iscariot</text>
  <text start="258.969" dur="4.161">used his position as the treasurer to</text>
  <text start="261.459" dur="5.241">begin stealing money from the money</text>
  <text start="263.13" dur="5.52">back of course Yahshua knew Judas was</text>
  <text start="266.7" dur="4.14">indulging in the secret sin but said</text>
  <text start="268.65" dur="3.75">nothing the other 11 disciples were</text>
  <text start="270.84" dur="3.51">completely ignorant of what Judas</text>
  <text start="272.4" dur="4.02">Iscariot was doing Judas Iscariot</text>
  <text start="274.35" dur="4.35">crossing over from a pure heart to a</text>
  <text start="276.42" dur="4.67">thief knew how to wear a convincing mask</text>
  <text start="278.7" dur="5.61">that tricked everyone except Yahshua</text>
  <text start="281.09" dur="5.23">even the disciple named John who often</text>
  <text start="284.31" dur="4.35">rested his head on yahshua&amp;#39;s breasts did</text>
  <text start="286.32" dur="5.34">not know that juice Iscariot was leading</text>
  <text start="288.66" dur="5.69">a double life until Passover night just</text>
  <text start="291.66" dur="6.33">before the crucifixion Judas Iscariot</text>
  <text start="294.35" dur="5.46">was in love with money which the</text>
  <text start="297.99" dur="4.8">scripture says is the root of all evil</text>
  <text start="299.81" dur="4.9">Ezekiel 28 shows how Lucifer before you</text>
  <text start="302.79" dur="3.86">fell into sin created merchandise and</text>
  <text start="304.71" dur="5.37">prosperity in the heavenly Mount Zion</text>
  <text start="306.65" dur="4.84">but at some point Lucifer became so in</text>
  <text start="310.08" dur="3.69">love with all the merchandise and</text>
  <text start="311.49" dur="4.62">prosperity yah had allowed him to create</text>
  <text start="313.77" dur="5.7">the heavenlies that lucifer began to sin</text>
  <text start="316.11" dur="6.99">and crossed over from glorious lucifer</text>
  <text start="319.47" dur="7.35">to wicked and devilish Satan see Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="323.1" dur="6.15">chapter 28 verse 16 as you can see Judas</text>
  <text start="326.82" dur="4.83">Iscariot is guilty of the same exact sin</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="4.71">that brought down Lucifer Judas Iscariot</text>
  <text start="331.65" dur="4.5">as he is indulging in a secret sin of</text>
  <text start="333.96" dur="4.23">stealing money got a very bad idea one</text>
  <text start="336.15" dur="4.86">day remember the story in the Gospels</text>
  <text start="338.19" dur="4.23">where after feeding the 5000 yah shall</text>
  <text start="341.01" dur="3.12">had to flee from the crowd because they</text>
  <text start="342.42" dur="4.29">were demanding him to become king and</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="4.92">destroy Rome the oshawa told the crowd</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="4.05">that it was not his time yet to be king</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="3.3">over the earth the crowd did not</text>
  <text start="350.76" dur="3.96">understand that Yahshua first had to</text>
  <text start="352.35" dur="5.55">come as the Isaiah 53 suffering servant</text>
  <text start="354.72" dur="5.87">and would not come as a Zechariah 14</text>
  <text start="357.9" dur="5.13">reigning king for another 2,000 years</text>
  <text start="360.59" dur="4.51">Yahshua fled the crowd and hid himself</text>
  <text start="363.03" dur="3.69">with his disciples in the mountains for</text>
  <text start="365.1" dur="4.17">he knew the crowd would try to force him</text>
  <text start="366.72" dur="5.94">to become king however Judas Iscariot</text>
  <text start="369.27" dur="5.55">got a devilish thought he said hey I bet</text>
  <text start="372.66" dur="4.32">I know how I can force yahushua to</text>
  <text start="374.82" dur="3.9">become king and destroy Roman rule the</text>
  <text start="376.98" dur="4.86">earth I bet I can even make some money</text>
  <text start="378.72" dur="5.43">on the side so Judas Iscariot begins to</text>
  <text start="381.84" dur="3.9">form a plan in his mind he agrees with</text>
  <text start="384.15" dur="3.78">the high priest at four thirty pieces of</text>
  <text start="385.74" dur="4.62">silver he will betray Yahshua into their</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="4.65">hands Judas Iscariot had deceived</text>
  <text start="390.36" dur="4.08">himself into thinking Yahshua will be</text>
  <text start="392.58" dur="3.01">forced to defend himself and thus become</text>
  <text start="394.44" dur="3.01">the king that everyone</text>

  <text start="416.68" dur="3.69">secrets and judas iscariot allowed in</text>
  <text start="418.84" dur="3.18">his heart began to dilute him into</text>

  <text start="531.43" dur="3.84">disciples realize what a liar and</text>
  <text start="533.26" dur="4.08">traitor he is but that he alone is</text>
  <text start="535.27" dur="4.41">responsible for the death of Yahshua the</text>

  <text start="544.99" dur="3.48">the thirty pieces of silver at the</text>
  <text start="546.52" dur="4.35">temple but the high priest simply scoffs</text>
  <text start="548.47" dur="4.83">at him Judas Iscariot feels very sorry</text>
  <text start="550.87" dur="5.37">about his terrible sins yet unlike Peter</text>
  <text start="553.3" dur="4.65">Judas Iscariot refuses to repent for</text>
  <text start="556.24" dur="3.96">true repentance is not merely feeling</text>
  <text start="557.95" dur="4.38">sorry for your sins true repentance is</text>
  <text start="560.2" dur="4.53">the act of burning away totally from one</text>
  <text start="562.33" dur="4.8">sins and placing one&amp;#39;s faith completely</text>
  <text start="564.73" dur="4.049">and Yahshua the Messiah when Peter</text>
  <text start="567.13" dur="4.02">betrayed Yahshua after his bitter</text>
  <text start="568.779" dur="4.801">weeping he eventually repented throwing</text>
  <text start="571.15" dur="4.86">himself on the mercy of Yahshua but not</text>
  <text start="573.58" dur="4.44">so Judas Iscariot Judas wept bitter</text>

  <text start="784.85" dur="7.679">has hundreds of years before but wait in</text>

  <text start="840.439" dur="4.921">to a three cubit high chapter height</text>
  <text start="842.8" dur="4.81">this caused the art to be lowered on a</text>

  <text start="847.61" dur="4.139">hundred feet below inside the earth</text>
  <text start="849.399" dur="3.88">Jeremiah and Levitical priests then</text>
  <text start="851.749" dur="3.09">transported the ark through an extensive</text>
  <text start="853.279" dur="2.91">network of tunnels where it was</text>
  <text start="854.839" dur="3.42">carefully hidden below the ground</text>
  <text start="856.189" dur="3.361">beneath the city of Jerusalem for</text>
  <text start="858.259" dur="3.33">hundreds of years the Ark of the</text>

  <text start="861.589" dur="4.29">Jeremiah and the Levitical priests had</text>
  <text start="863.269" dur="5.19">taken it beneath the city of Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="865.879" dur="5.4">this is why the Babylonians stole all</text>
  <text start="868.459" dur="4.8">the temple treasure but not one mention</text>
  <text start="871.279" dur="4.651">is made of them ever having stolen the</text>
  <text start="873.259" dur="4.44">Ark and of course we know this because</text>
  <text start="875.93" dur="3.54">like when the Philistines stole the ark</text>
  <text start="877.699" dur="4.83">way back in the days of Samuel and Saul</text>
  <text start="879.47" dur="5.64">and David the Philistines were you know</text>
  <text start="882.529" dur="4.651">hit with all these cancers and diseases</text>
  <text start="885.11" dur="4.26">and stuff and they eventually returned</text>
  <text start="887.18" dur="3.75">the ark on a cart back to Israel but</text>
  <text start="889.37" dur="3.509">there&amp;#39;s no mention of the Babylonians</text>
  <text start="890.93" dur="4.23">getting smitten with cancer because they</text>
  <text start="892.879" dur="4.56">took the art no so there&amp;#39;s no mention of</text>
  <text start="895.16" dur="4.2">the ark at all this is why no mention of</text>
