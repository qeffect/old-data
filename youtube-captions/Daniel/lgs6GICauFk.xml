  <text start="187.02" dur="5.55">really do want an older woman of yahoos</text>
  <text start="190.14" dur="4.02">walk with y&amp;#39;all longer than me to mentor</text>
  <text start="192.57" dur="3.42">me because it actually says in the book</text>
  <text start="194.16" dur="3.66">of first Timothy that the younger women</text>
  <text start="195.99" dur="3.78">are supposed to ask the older women to</text>
  <text start="197.82" dur="4.02">mentor them particularly as it pertains</text>
  <text start="199.77" dur="4.29">to marriage and we&amp;#39;ve sort of lost that</text>
  <text start="201.84" dur="3.66">in today&amp;#39;s Christianity but but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="5.1">right there in the book of Timothy and</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s needed and I said well John and</text>
  <text start="209.16" dur="3.18">Shannon you know John and Shannon are</text>
  <text start="210.57" dur="4.08">the ones in San Diego John&amp;#39;s the lead</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="4.83">investigator in Riverside County that</text>
  <text start="214.65" dur="4.5">has hunted down and arrested Satanic</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="3.93">pedophiles for four decades and then I</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="4.559">went to go visit John and Shannon when</text>
  <text start="221.1" dur="4.44">they invited me for Sukkot this last</text>

  <text start="234.57" dur="3.54">my fiance was attending the prayer</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="2.55">meetings that&amp;#39;s the other thing I need</text>
  <text start="238.11" dur="2.79">to correct I said that she wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="239.64" dur="3.12">attending the prayer meetings what I</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="3.39">meant to say is she hadn&amp;#39;t attended them</text>
  <text start="242.76" dur="3.3">recently because of work and other</text>
  <text start="244.29" dur="3.63">things but she did attend the prayer</text>
  <text start="246.06" dur="3.75">meetings she was shoot during the four</text>
  <text start="247.92" dur="3.18">months of our courtship she was</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="4.47">attending the prayer meetings when she</text>
