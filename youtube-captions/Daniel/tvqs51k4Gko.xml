  <text start="32.52" dur="3.84">month this year the rabbi&amp;#39;s all say that</text>
  <text start="35.13" dur="2.91">the path server is going to be happening</text>
  <text start="36.36" dur="4.699">in late March and you have passed over</text>
  <text start="38.04" dur="5.73">happening in late april 2013 what&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="41.059" dur="7.721">okay so I&amp;#39;m going to make yet another</text>
  <text start="43.77" dur="8.19">YouTube about the calendar so the</text>
  <text start="48.78" dur="5.82">calendar that the Jews follow was</text>
  <text start="51.96" dur="5.61">created by a man named Hallel in the</text>
  <text start="54.6" dur="6.38">fourth century this is 400 years after</text>
  <text start="57.57" dur="6.93">the Messiah and he made this</text>
  <text start="60.98" dur="6.61">pre-calculated calendar that really is</text>
  <text start="64.5" dur="5.159">not rooted in Scripture at all now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="67.59" dur="5.099">completely wrong one thing I want to</text>
  <text start="69.659" dur="6.181">point out is that even the rabbi&amp;#39;s admit</text>
  <text start="72.689" dur="6.061">that they will never have the Passover</text>
  <text start="75.84" dur="4.59">before the spring equinox okay the</text>
  <text start="78.75" dur="3.96">Passover always have just asked to be</text>
  <text start="80.43" dur="4.53">after the spring equinox it always has</text>
  <text start="82.71" dur="5.699">to be in the spring time they will admit</text>
  <text start="84.96" dur="5.549">that however they don&amp;#39;t also realize</text>
  <text start="88.409" dur="5.611">that you know Passover is on the</text>
  <text start="90.509" dur="4.561">fourteenth day of the first month so if</text>
  <text start="94.02" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re going to acknowledge that</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="4.17">Passover a fork and a the first month</text>
  <text start="96.99" dur="4.769">has to be in the spring why don&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="99.24" dur="4.86">also recognize that the first day of the</text>
  <text start="101.759" dur="4.231">month which happens 14 days before pass</text>
  <text start="104.1" dur="5.729">are over also has to be in the spring</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="10.11">you see this year the next new moon is</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="8.701">going to be occurring on March the 12th</text>
  <text start="116.1" dur="3.93">to march the 13th that&amp;#39;s the evening of</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="4.47">the 12th for the evening of March the</text>
  <text start="120.03" dur="4.799">13th is the next new moon and that is</text>
  <text start="123" dur="5.19">before the spring equinox it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="124.829" dur="5.52">winter time and that&amp;#39;s when all the</text>
  <text start="128.19" dur="4.23">rabbi&amp;#39;s are starting their new year and</text>
  <text start="130.349" dur="3.061">then they&amp;#39;re going to be having Passover</text>
  <text start="132.42" dur="4.56">in late March but</text>
  <text start="133.41" dur="4.8">cannot start the year in winter time you</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="4.1">can&amp;#39;t do it and even the rabbi&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.21" dur="5.52">acknowledge that but again they follow</text>
  <text start="141.08" dur="4.39">halolz pre-calculated calendar they</text>
  <text start="143.73" dur="3.24">don&amp;#39;t even acknowledge the new year</text>
  <text start="145.47" dur="4.41">because they start the new year back in</text>
  <text start="146.97" dur="5.01">the fall on Feast of Trumpets yom teruah</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="3.66">which typically is the seventh month so</text>
  <text start="151.98" dur="8.16">that&amp;#39;s why they get they get thrown off</text>
  <text start="153.54" dur="9.14">so so badly I in Genesis 1 16 we know</text>
  <text start="160.14" dur="7.68">that we have to use the Sun the moon</text>
  <text start="162.68" dur="8.74">these are used to determine seasons and</text>
  <text start="167.82" dur="7.35">we also know from Exodus and from</text>
  <text start="171.42" dur="6.96">Leviticus that the barley in Israel has</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="5.7">to be Aviv because you have to present a</text>
  <text start="178.38" dur="5.46">first fruits of your barley harvest to</text>
  <text start="180.87" dur="5.01">the high priest for the countdown of the</text>
  <text start="183.84" dur="5.04">omer for the feast of firstfruits during</text>
  <text start="185.88" dur="10.83">passover week that counts down to shadow</text>
  <text start="188.88" dur="9.69">out now in order to use the moon we know</text>
  <text start="196.71" dur="4.53">that we know that the new moon starts</text>
  <text start="198.57" dur="4.29">the first day of the month but then in</text>
  <text start="201.24" dur="2.91">order to use the Sun to determine the</text>
  <text start="202.86" dur="3.09">new year you have to use the spring</text>
  <text start="204.15" dur="5.27">equinox so you have to start with the</text>
  <text start="205.95" dur="6.21">first new moon after the spring equinox</text>
  <text start="209.42" dur="4.96">and that will begin your new year so</text>
  <text start="212.16" dur="5.25">that new moon is now is not going to</text>
  <text start="214.38" dur="4.59">occur until the evening of April temp to</text>
  <text start="217.41" dur="3.72">the evening of april eleventh that is</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="5.19">when the new year begins and then 14</text>
  <text start="221.13" dur="4.859">days later you have Passover now one</text>
  <text start="224.16" dur="5.94">very important thing that&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="225.989" dur="8.101">too to see about this is that the barley</text>
  <text start="230.1" dur="7.74">in Israel will not be ready to be reaped</text>
  <text start="234.09" dur="6.3">will not be ready to be presented as a</text>
  <text start="237.84" dur="9.81">first fruit offering until it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.39" dur="9.12">completely ripe and on the day of the</text>
  <text start="247.65" dur="3.48">new moon that&amp;#39;s coming up March twelfth</text>
  <text start="249.51" dur="3.479">to the evening of our 13th I can tell</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="4.62">you that the barley throughout all of</text>
  <text start="252.989" dur="4.68">Israel will not be a V it will not be</text>
  <text start="255.75" dur="6.419">ready to harvest see a similar thing</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="6.151">happened back in 2010 where we had a new</text>
  <text start="262.169" dur="4.861">moon that fall fell even later than us</text>
  <text start="263.82" dur="5.58">it was on the sixteenth of March and</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="4.5">Gordon he spotted some of you barley</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="4.23">right outside of Jerusalem but in</text>
  <text start="271.53" dur="5.31">northern Israel and in the canoe net</text>
  <text start="273.63" dur="5.22">there were whole stretches of barley</text>
  <text start="276.84" dur="4.32">that was completely unripe it was not</text>
  <text start="278.85" dur="6.72">ready to be harvested and there&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="281.16" dur="7.92">clear command in Leviticus 23 10 I will</text>
  <text start="285.57" dur="6.12">read it now and it says speak under the</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="4.53">children of Israel and saying to them</text>
  <text start="291.69" dur="3.75">when you be coming to the land which I</text>
  <text start="293.61" dur="4.559">given to you and shall reap the harvest</text>
  <text start="295.44" dur="4.86">thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of</text>
  <text start="298.169" dur="4.951">the first fruits of your harvest unto</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="5.1">the priests ok and this is the first</text>
  <text start="303.12" dur="4.83">fruits that falls again during Passover</text>
  <text start="305.4" dur="6.06">week so this is after they reaped the</text>
  <text start="307.95" dur="8.34">harvest ok well barley is not going to</text>
  <text start="311.46" dur="6.48">be ready at all it&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="316.29" dur="5.01">ready at all in fact if you start the</text>
  <text start="317.94" dur="5.01">new year on March the 12th of the 13th</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="4.17">and you have Passover in late March</text>
  <text start="322.95" dur="4.23">you&amp;#39;re not going to give sufficient time</text>
  <text start="325.47" dur="3.99">for the volley to be fully ripe and to</text>
  <text start="327.18" dur="4.14">be able to harvest it remember all the</text>
  <text start="329.46" dur="4.98">tribes of Israel had to harvest it and</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="6.36">then bring up a first fruit offering to</text>
  <text start="334.44" dur="4.62">the high priest in Jerusalem and you</text>
  <text start="337.68" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t give enough time for that to occur</text>
  <text start="339.06" dur="5.37">if you have Passover in late March it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="342.15" dur="6.66">just not going to not going to not going</text>
  <text start="344.43" dur="6.299">to give the time that is needed so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="348.81" dur="5.609">all happening way way way too early now</text>
  <text start="350.729" dur="6">I&amp;#39;m going to post a link to this YouTube</text>
  <text start="354.419" dur="4.471">that has a very very extensive article</text>
  <text start="356.729" dur="4.051">by another guy named little guy in the</text>
  <text start="358.89" dur="4.589">eye who has compiled a lot of different</text>
  <text start="360.78" dur="5.49">resources that shows from a lot of</text>
  <text start="363.479" dur="4.711">different angles why the new year does</text>
  <text start="366.27" dur="4.709">not start until the first new moon after</text>
  <text start="368.19" dur="4.26">the spring equinox when always every</text>
  <text start="370.979" dur="3.181">time you start on the first new moon</text>
  <text start="372.45" dur="4.29">after the spring equinox you will always</text>
  <text start="374.16" dur="4.92">ensure that the barley throughout the</text>
  <text start="376.74" dur="4.32">entire land of Israel will be ready to</text>
  <text start="379.08" dur="4.83">be harvested and will be given enough</text>
  <text start="381.06" dur="4.44">time for the people of Israel all the</text>
  <text start="383.91" dur="3.48">nations the tribes of Israel to bring up</text>
  <text start="385.5" dur="4.44">that barley harvest to Jerusalem which</text>
  <text start="387.39" dur="6.149">was what was done in ancient Israel and</text>
  <text start="389.94" dur="5.13">which was done in biblical times but</text>
  <text start="393.539" dur="3.841">there&amp;#39;s a lot of other different angles</text>
  <text start="395.07" dur="5.04">to this that I just simply can&amp;#39;t cover</text>
  <text start="397.38" dur="4.29">in a short YouTube format</text>
  <text start="400.11" dur="3.42">so if you want to do more investigation</text>
  <text start="401.67" dur="4.92">you can go into that also there is a</text>
  <text start="403.53" dur="4.71">book free online book that donna</text>
  <text start="406.59" dur="4.92">esposito just came out with this year</text>
  <text start="408.24" dur="7.83">and the first four chapters very very</text>
  <text start="411.51" dur="7.98">clearly articulate the calendar issue as</text>
  <text start="416.07" dur="4.74">well and again there&amp;#39;s a lot of things</text>
  <text start="419.49" dur="3.24">that I can&amp;#39;t go over in a short YouTube</text>
  <text start="420.81" dur="5.28">but if anyone wants a copy of that free</text>
  <text start="422.73" dur="5.4">online book i can send that to you you</text>
  <text start="426.09" dur="4.5">just contact me through the web and i</text>
  <text start="428.13" dur="4.41">can send you that book i&amp;#39;ve already sent</text>
  <text start="430.59" dur="5.55">it to one person contacted me through</text>
  <text start="432.54" dur="4.83">the web so there are definitely</text>
  <text start="436.14" dur="3.9">different resources out there that you</text>
  <text start="437.37" dur="5.91">can see why the new year will not start</text>
  <text start="440.04" dur="6.75">until april now I believe it is very</text>
  <text start="443.28" dur="5.88">very important that we keep the feasts</text>
  <text start="446.79" dur="3.69">on the right day not only is it</text>
  <text start="449.16" dur="3.24">important because we need to make sure</text>
  <text start="450.48" dur="3.87">we keep in the feast win Yahweh wants us</text>
  <text start="452.4" dur="3.48">to eat the piece and when the scripture</text>
  <text start="454.35" dur="4.05">tells us but because we&amp;#39;re entering into</text>
  <text start="455.88" dur="5.22">a season 2013 where I believe it is</text>
  <text start="458.4" dur="5.13">absolutely essential for our spiritual</text>
  <text start="461.1" dur="4.89">well-being and for our safety protection</text>
  <text start="463.53" dur="6.15">that we&amp;#39;re keeping the feasts on the</text>
  <text start="465.99" dur="6.24">right day okay as right now we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="469.68" dur="4.08">to a time where I just saw another</text>
  <text start="472.23" dur="3.54">YouTube where someone was saying oh look</text>
  <text start="473.76" dur="4.14">Obama&amp;#39;s going to Jerusalem before</text>
  <text start="475.77" dur="3.57">Passover six days before Passover and</text>
  <text start="477.9" dur="4.23">this is showing that he&amp;#39;s the Antichrist</text>
  <text start="479.34" dur="5.67">look Obama is not the Antichrist he is a</text>
  <text start="482.13" dur="5.37">decoy Passover is not in late March</text>
  <text start="485.01" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s a false pass over the anthem si</text>
  <text start="487.5" dur="4.98">is not going to come forth until 2014</text>
  <text start="490.05" dur="4.5">and trust me is not going to be Obama</text>
  <text start="492.48" dur="3.93">because the scripture is very clear that</text>
  <text start="494.55" dur="3.66">whoever the anthem acai is over the</text>
  <text start="496.41" dur="4.59">false prophet is he someone is able to</text>
  <text start="498.21" dur="4.35">deceive almost the entire world and I</text>
  <text start="501" dur="3.69">know many many people who have</text>
  <text start="502.56" dur="3.72">absolutely no relationship with Yahshua</text>
  <text start="504.69" dur="5.25">are not throw with the spirit and they</text>
  <text start="506.28" dur="6.75">don&amp;#39;t like Obama at all so that&amp;#39;s all a</text>
  <text start="509.94" dur="5.25">big distraction and a decoy so for your</text>
  <text start="513.03" dur="4.89">spiritual well-being to make sure that</text>
  <text start="515.19" dur="4.62">you don&amp;#39;t fall into the trap of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="517.92" dur="4.23">coming up you&amp;#39;ve got to keep the feasts</text>
  <text start="519.81" dur="7.2">on the right days that&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="522.15" dur="7.8">imperative so don&amp;#39;t follow the hallel</text>
  <text start="527.01" dur="5.1">calendars don&amp;#39;t follow Nehemia Gordon</text>
  <text start="529.95" dur="3.48">because like in 2010 yeah he found some</text>
  <text start="532.11" dur="3.18">of a small patch of you</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="3.96">barley rats out outside of Jerusalem and</text>
  <text start="535.29" dur="4.35">again there was barley all throughout</text>
  <text start="537.39" dur="5.19">Israel that was not ripe not ready to be</text>
  <text start="539.64" dur="4.83">harvested so you need to follow the</text>
  <text start="542.58" dur="3.54">scriptures and the scriptures are very</text>
  <text start="544.47" dur="3.96">clear you wait for the first new moon</text>
  <text start="546.12" dur="3.9">after the spring equinox when the barley</text>
  <text start="548.43" dur="4.17">is fully Aviv that way you&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="550.02" dur="5.22">Sun the moon and the barley all three</text>
  <text start="552.6" dur="5.15">indicators to determine your new year</text>
  <text start="555.24" dur="6.599">that is the only scriptural way to go</text>
