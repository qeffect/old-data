  <text start="3.12" dur="6.99">it is Saturday September the 21st 2019</text>
  <text start="7.14" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s now the 22nd day of the sixth year</text>
  <text start="10.11" dur="5.43">a month which means we are now very very</text>
  <text start="11.7" dur="5.55">close to yom teruah the Feast of</text>
  <text start="15.54" dur="4.079">Trumpets what the Jews call Rosh</text>
  <text start="17.25" dur="5.369">Hashanah it&amp;#39;s the first of the fall</text>
  <text start="19.619" dur="6.301">feasts that kick off the fall feast</text>
  <text start="22.619" dur="6.24">season and just as I made very special</text>
  <text start="25.92" dur="4.65">teachings for a Purim earlier this year</text>
  <text start="28.859" dur="4.051">back in the month of March and then I</text>
  <text start="30.57" dur="4.35">made teachings for Passover and</text>
  <text start="32.91" dur="4.5">unleavened bread and first fruits back</text>
  <text start="34.92" dur="5.88">in April when Jeff came up here and I</text>
  <text start="37.41" dur="5.969">baptized him in the glacier waters of</text>
  <text start="40.8" dur="6.12">Yas blue and then of course I also made</text>
  <text start="43.379" dur="5.43">a teaching for Pentecost in in June did</text>
  <text start="46.92" dur="3.63">those spring feasts now we&amp;#39;re coming up</text>
  <text start="48.809" dur="3.871">for the fall feasts so before we get to</text>
  <text start="50.55" dur="5.009">yom teruah the Feast of Trumpets which</text>
  <text start="52.68" dur="4.32">by the way is a high Sabbath that means</text>
  <text start="55.559" dur="4.68">no matter what day of the week it falls</text>
  <text start="57" dur="5.43">on its a Shabbat and it always falls on</text>
  <text start="60.239" dur="4.35">a different day every year anywhere from</text>
  <text start="62.43" dur="4.56">September to October depending on the</text>
  <text start="64.589" dur="4.741">year and this year it begins on Sunday</text>
  <text start="66.99" dur="5.58">night at sunset September 29th and goes</text>
  <text start="69.33" dur="5.19">all day through Monday September 30th</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="4.5">and so I want to do a teaching about yom</text>
  <text start="74.52" dur="5.669">teruah the Feast of Trumpets or the</text>
  <text start="77.07" dur="7.86">Feast of shouting in fact to start off</text>
  <text start="80.189" dur="8.761">this teaching I&amp;#39;ll just again unveil my</text>
  <text start="84.93" dur="6.84">beautiful shofar here</text>
  <text start="88.95" dur="5.37">the Feast of Trumpets which technically</text>
  <text start="91.77" dur="5.7">they were blowing silver trumpets on</text>
  <text start="94.32" dur="6.71">that day and the Jews even to this day</text>
  <text start="97.47" dur="6.06">on what they wrongly call Rosh Hashanah</text>
  <text start="101.03" dur="4.6">they will blow their trumpets as well</text>
  <text start="103.53" dur="4.89">and even shofars right there in</text>
  <text start="105.63" dur="4.94">Jerusalem so definitely a day to be</text>
  <text start="108.42" dur="4.47">blowing up the trumpets the shofars</text>
  <text start="110.57" dur="6.52">shouting praise you don&amp;#39;t sure literally</text>
  <text start="112.89" dur="6.269">means to shout to praise hallelujah that</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="4.68">word that Hebrew word of Tarawa is</text>
  <text start="119.159" dur="5.701">actually used in the story about the</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="5.43">children of Israel walking around the</text>
  <text start="124.86" dur="3.869">walls of Jericho and they shout with</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="2.309">praises on that last day and the walls</text>
  <text start="128.729" dur="5.251">come tumbling down</text>
  <text start="129.509" dur="6.331">so yom teruah the Feast of Trumpets this</text>
  <text start="133.98" dur="5.49">is a day that&amp;#39;s been celebrated for</text>
  <text start="135.84" dur="6.119">thousands of years and Satan hates this</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="5.73">day because it is the next feast to be</text>
  <text start="141.959" dur="5.791">fulfilled remember Passover was</text>
  <text start="145.2" dur="4.8">fulfilled when Jesus was crucified on</text>
  <text start="147.75" dur="5.16">the cross he was buried during</text>
  <text start="150" dur="4.98">unleavened bread heroes for firstfruits</text>
  <text start="152.91" dur="4.02">as the first true for among the dead he</text>
  <text start="154.98" dur="4.86">poured out his Holy Spirit on Pentecost</text>
  <text start="156.93" dur="4.41">and so he&amp;#39;s fulfilled the spring feast</text>
  <text start="159.84" dur="3.42">and we continue to celebrate those</text>
  <text start="161.34" dur="5.1">feasts looking back on what he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="4.59">but yom teruah the Feast of Trumpets he</text>
  <text start="166.44" dur="3.09">is not yet fulfilled</text>
  <text start="167.85" dur="4.05">he hasn&amp;#39;t fulfilled any of the fall</text>
  <text start="169.53" dur="8.459">feasts actually because the first time</text>
  <text start="171.9" dur="8.07">he came was as the son of Joseph Messiah</text>
  <text start="177.989" dur="3.931">Ben Joseph the suffering servant like</text>
  <text start="179.97" dur="4.68">what&amp;#39;s talked about in Psalm 22 in</text>
  <text start="181.92" dur="5.819">Isaiah 53 the second time is coming is</text>
  <text start="184.65" dur="4.95">going to be as Messiah Ben Davida</text>
  <text start="187.739" dur="3.801">Messiah ben david the conquering and</text>
  <text start="189.6" dur="5.55">ruling King has defect depicted</text>
  <text start="191.54" dur="5.86">Zechariah 14 revelation 20 he has not</text>
  <text start="195.15" dur="4.309">yet fulfilled those fall feasts so the</text>
  <text start="197.4" dur="4.61">Feast of Trumpets yom teruah</text>
  <text start="199.459" dur="5.981">let&amp;#39;s talk about it what does it mean</text>
  <text start="202.01" dur="7.14">talked about all through scripture in</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="7.09">fact one of the first</text>
  <text start="209.15" dur="5.759">fulfillments of the Feast of Trumpets</text>
  <text start="212.53" dur="5.62">it&amp;#39;s pointing toward the fulfillment of</text>
  <text start="214.909" dur="11.371">the Feast of Trumpets rather is in the</text>
  <text start="218.15" dur="20.149">Book of Daniel the book of Daniel</text>
  <text start="226.28" dur="12.019">chapter 12 where it says</text>
  <text start="241.93" dur="10.71">oh where is it oh yeah here it is</text>
  <text start="249.75" dur="4.65">Daniel chapter 12 verse 2 and many of</text>
  <text start="252.64" dur="8.309">them that sleep in the dust of the earth</text>
  <text start="254.4" dur="8.38">shall awake some to everlasting life on</text>
  <text start="260.949" dur="4.44">the last part doesn&amp;#39;t get fulfilled for</text>
  <text start="262.78" dur="5.009">a thousand years later after the</text>
  <text start="265.389" dur="4.831">Millennial Kingdom and some to shame and</text>
  <text start="267.789" dur="3.63">everlasting contempt that&amp;#39;s the second</text>
  <text start="270.22" dur="3.539">death we don&amp;#39;t talk about that because</text>
  <text start="271.419" dur="4.411">that&amp;#39;s more concerning with Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="273.759" dur="6.391">the Feast of Trumpets deals that first</text>
  <text start="275.83" dur="6.45">half of the verse Paul talks about this</text>
  <text start="280.15" dur="4.889">well actually Messiah talks about the</text>
  <text start="282.28" dur="4.59">fulfillment of this feast quite quite</text>
  <text start="285.039" dur="4.681">often throughout the Gospels word and he</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="6.09">talks about how he will send His angels</text>
  <text start="289.72" dur="5.28">to gather all of his elect all of his</text>
  <text start="292.96" dur="4.92">people from one corner of the earth to</text>
  <text start="295" dur="6.08">the other both the dead and Messiah and</text>
  <text start="297.88" dur="5.099">the living and gathered them unto him</text>
  <text start="301.08" dur="4.51">that will happen on the Feast of</text>
  <text start="302.979" dur="4.47">Trumpets how do we know that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="305.59" dur="4.949">happen on the Feast of Trumpets this day</text>
  <text start="307.449" dur="6.631">of blasting out the trumpets well huh</text>
  <text start="310.539" dur="5.491">Apostle Paul rabbi shai will really who</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="3.51">is a master of Torah helps to pinpoint</text>
  <text start="316.03" dur="4.23">this to the revelation of the Holy</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="8.609">Spirit that he was given in fact if we</text>
  <text start="320.26" dur="8.76">go to first Corinthians chapter 15 he</text>
