  <text start="12.54" dur="4.05">cave resort i just made a video where i</text>
  <text start="14.07" dur="4.85">showed what the environment looks like</text>
  <text start="16.59" dur="6.24">it&amp;#39;s an amazing place down here in</text>
  <text start="18.92" dur="5.29">southern oregon but yah had told me to</text>
  <text start="22.83" dur="3.779">come to these oregon caves and he was</text>
  <text start="24.21" dur="3.69">going to show me some things and as I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="26.609" dur="3.781">walking through these caves with the</text>
  <text start="27.9" dur="5.249">tour guide I see all these formations</text>
  <text start="30.39" dur="4.98">that look like menorahs i kid you not</text>
  <text start="33.149" dur="4.68">now they&amp;#39;re upside down but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="35.37" dur="4.83">little literally seven branches so I was</text>
  <text start="37.829" dur="4.651">like it was like I was seeing yas seven</text>
  <text start="40.2" dur="6.66">candled stick as described in revelation</text>
  <text start="42.48" dur="5.7">and in the torah all over the place then</text>
  <text start="46.86" dur="3">at one point there&amp;#39;s all these like</text>
  <text start="48.18" dur="4.62">squiggly lines that look like ruins</text>
  <text start="49.86" dur="4.35">along the cavern and the tour guy was</text>
  <text start="52.8" dur="4.38">explaining that these are signatures</text>
  <text start="54.21" dur="5.43">left by their called for MACUL Asians</text>
  <text start="57.18" dur="4.23">and they&amp;#39;re left by a flood a major</text>
  <text start="59.64" dur="3.96">flood that actually carved this cave out</text>
  <text start="61.41" dur="4.56">and all of a sudden I realized this this</text>
  <text start="63.6" dur="4.05">this cave was caused by the global flood</text>
  <text start="65.97" dur="5.009">by Noah&amp;#39;s Flood that happened about</text>
  <text start="67.65" dur="5.21">4,000 years ago now one point the tour</text>
  <text start="70.979" dur="5.131">guide pointed out to the whole group</text>
  <text start="72.86" dur="5.71">still AG tight and slag tights from the</text>
  <text start="76.11" dur="4.619">ceiling a stalagmite is from the floor</text>
  <text start="78.57" dur="4.38">because you might trip over it I finally</text>
  <text start="80.729" dur="3.871">got that down it&amp;#39;s taking me a while but</text>
  <text start="82.95" dur="3.54">she pointed out a stalagmite or slacked</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="4.199">out I can&amp;#39;t remember and she said it was</text>
  <text start="86.49" dur="4.89">two hundred thousand years old and I</text>
  <text start="88.799" dur="4.471">said excuse me I&amp;#39;m going to have to</text>
  <text start="91.38" dur="4.26">disagree with you on that and I</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="5.309">explained to her about the physics law</text>
  <text start="95.64" dur="4.35">of the Roche limit where the moon is</text>
  <text start="98.579" dur="3.75">orbiting farther from the earth every</text>
  <text start="99.99" dur="4.86">year and it&amp;#39;s not at a constant rate it</text>
  <text start="102.329" dur="4.08">actually was was going faster longer ago</text>
  <text start="104.85" dur="4.949">than it is now it&amp;#39;s going slower now but</text>
  <text start="106.409" dur="4.621">it moves at a fairly constant rate</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="3.481">farther and farther from the earth so</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="4.29">every year the moon is slightly farther</text>
  <text start="113.28" dur="4.32">from the earth well you can only wind</text>
  <text start="115.32" dur="3.899">the clock back about six thousand years</text>
  <text start="117.6" dur="3.269">before the moon is so close to the earth</text>
  <text start="119.219" dur="3.72">that it would either literally break</text>
  <text start="120.869" dur="3.511">apart from the gravitational field of</text>
  <text start="122.939" dur="3.661">the earth or it would slam into the</text>
  <text start="124.38" dur="4.109">earth itself so so I disagree with her</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="4.29">and and in fact she then showed me a</text>
  <text start="128.489" dur="3.951">stalagmite that the Oregon cave</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="5.69">caretakers had to cut</text>
  <text start="132.44" dur="6.51">cut away to clear a path and it had four</text>
  <text start="136.58" dur="5.07">rings four concentric rings within the</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="4.83">stalagmite and it&amp;#39;s the same number of</text>
  <text start="141.65" dur="3.6">rings that are in the redwood trees that</text>
  <text start="143.78" dur="4.35">are in Southern Oregon and Northern</text>
  <text start="145.25" dur="5.25">California I&amp;#39;ve never been to the</text>
  <text start="148.13" dur="3.87">redwood trees I know some friends have</text>
  <text start="150.5" dur="3.9">but I&amp;#39;ve studied about them and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152" dur="5.52">also four rings on these redwood trees</text>
  <text start="154.4" dur="5.7">from the pictures I&amp;#39;ve seen and it dates</text>
  <text start="157.52" dur="5.33">it back to about 4,000 years ago when</text>
  <text start="160.1" dur="4.83">the when the flood actually occurred so</text>
  <text start="162.85" dur="5.88">lots of evidence and I was able to</text>
  <text start="164.93" dur="5.79">testify to that of the age of the earth</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="3.58">like I said we went through this one</text>
  <text start="170.72" dur="3.51">chamber that was just immense it must</text>
  <text start="172.31" dur="4.2">have been half a football field long it</text>
  <text start="174.23" dur="3.69">was this giant cavern something you</text>
  <text start="176.51" dur="3.69">might see that the dwarves would be</text>
  <text start="177.92" dur="4.11">living in Lord of the Rings immense</text>
  <text start="180.2" dur="4.26">stone caught with there was there was</text>
  <text start="182.03" dur="4.11">sort of delicate stone columns I was</text>
  <text start="184.46" dur="4.59">struck by the patterns and the elegance</text>
  <text start="186.14" dur="4.11">of this cave it was unbelievable it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.05" dur="3.39">just incredible it was like Yas</text>
  <text start="190.25" dur="7.14">fingerprint was everywhere all through</text>
  <text start="192.44" dur="6.18">the cave there was one point called the</text>
  <text start="197.39" dur="3.48">part of the cave was actually named</text>
  <text start="198.62" dur="4.22">Paradise Lost based off the book by John</text>
  <text start="200.87" dur="4.2">Milton that he wrote back in the 1600s</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="3.76">which is about the fall of Lucifer but</text>
  <text start="205.07" dur="5.58">but this point you look up into this</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="5.82">tall air shaft and there are these</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="3.54">stalagmites that have formed that</text>
  <text start="212.42" dur="5.25">literally they&amp;#39;re so delicate they look</text>
  <text start="214.19" dur="6.6">like folds of fabric like a robe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.67" dur="4.92">beautiful um there was another part</text>
  <text start="220.79" dur="3.06">called the belly of the whale so I</text>
  <text start="222.59" dur="2.88">finally asked it to her guy had said you</text>
  <text start="223.85" dur="3.63">know it sounds like someone either read</text>
  <text start="225.47" dur="3.87">John Milton or you know I mean it</text>
  <text start="227.48" dur="5.61">sounded biblical these names for this</text>
  <text start="229.34" dur="5.369">cave that I was going through and anyway</text>
  <text start="233.09" dur="4.74">so we got through the we got through the</text>
  <text start="234.709" dur="6.271">entire tour there was also this fungal</text>
  <text start="237.83" dur="5.909">material or something contra but what it</text>
  <text start="240.98" dur="5.49">was but if you shine UV light on it it</text>
  <text start="243.739" dur="4.321">glows it&amp;#39;s luminescent and then you shut</text>
  <text start="246.47" dur="3.93">the light off and it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s this glow</text>
  <text start="248.06" dur="5.01">and she had forgotten to bring the UV</text>
  <text start="250.4" dur="4.32">light but I don&amp;#39;t know i was so impacted</text>
  <text start="253.07" dur="3.27">by that cave to her that i think i might</text>
  <text start="254.72" dur="4.47">come back tomorrow for preparation day</text>
  <text start="256.34" dur="4.709">um and do another tour and I asked if</text>
  <text start="259.19" dur="3.3">she could find her UV light she said she</text>
  <text start="261.049" dur="3.34">would by tomorrow so i may come back</text>
  <text start="262.49" dur="3.729">here tomorrow morning and do another</text>
  <text start="264.389" dur="3.75">tour there&amp;#39;s a mountain that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="266.219" dur="4.29">next to these caves it&amp;#39;s called Mount</text>
  <text start="268.139" dur="3.511">Elijah and I want to hike that mountain</text>
  <text start="270.509" dur="3.12">because I feel like y&amp;#39;all&amp;#39;s going to</text>

  <text start="300.24" dur="4.289">to show me through the caves now it</text>
  <text start="303.029" dur="3.091">wasn&amp;#39;t a cave that you would think of</text>
  <text start="304.529" dur="3.301">where it&amp;#39;s like underground it&amp;#39;s a cave</text>
  <text start="306.12" dur="4.079">that actually goes through the side of a</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="3.329">mountain so you enter at the bottom of</text>
  <text start="310.199" dur="3.09">the mountain where i showed in the</text>
  <text start="311.159" dur="4.861">earlier youtube and then you come out</text>
