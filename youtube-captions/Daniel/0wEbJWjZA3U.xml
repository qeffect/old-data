  <text start="100.35" dur="5.97">news stuff she also said that this is</text>
  <text start="104.61" dur="4.68">what she had posted on her facebook this</text>

  <text start="109.29" dur="5.07">anniversary of me getting abuse memories</text>

  <text start="116.549" dur="4.021">year anniversary of starting to get my</text>
  <text start="118.049" dur="5.64">memories of sexual and ritual abuse that</text>
  <text start="120.57" dur="4.649">was July 23rd 1999 wow I can&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="123.689" dur="3.661">it&amp;#39;s been 20 years already</text>
  <text start="125.219" dur="4.051">I&amp;#39;ve definitely healed some since then</text>
  <text start="127.35" dur="3.01">but not nearly as much as I thought I</text>
  <text start="129.27" dur="3.28">would have by now</text>
  <text start="130.36" dur="4.98">I didn&amp;#39;t know PTSD was a life sentence</text>
  <text start="132.55" dur="4.89">when I was first diagnosed July 23rd</text>
  <text start="135.34" dur="4.47">1999 was the dividing point in my life</text>
  <text start="137.44" dur="4.89">it changed everything finally so much</text>
  <text start="139.81" dur="4.77">made sense why I had been a prostitute</text>
  <text start="142.33" dur="4.68">and dominatrix why I was used to cutting</text>
  <text start="144.58" dur="5.94">myself why I had all kinds of emotional</text>
  <text start="147.01" dur="4.74">issues panic attacks etc before my</text>
  <text start="150.52" dur="3.21">memories I thought there was something</text>
  <text start="151.75" dur="3.84">wrong with me like I was into like I was</text>
  <text start="153.73" dur="3.72">defective or something but after I</text>
  <text start="155.59" dur="3.9">realized that it wasn&amp;#39;t me at all it was</text>
  <text start="157.45" dur="3.78">just my response to what had happened to</text>
  <text start="159.49" dur="3.45">me that changed it from feeling like</text>
  <text start="161.23" dur="2.97">there was something wrong with me to</text>
  <text start="162.94" dur="2.88">seeing that there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with</text>
  <text start="164.2" dur="5.789">me only something wrong with what had</text>
  <text start="165.82" dur="5.88">happened to me so this this was a SRA</text>
  <text start="169.989" dur="4.531">survivor that I interviewed last fall</text>
  <text start="171.7" dur="4.74">and again I&amp;#39;m gonna put her patreon and</text>
  <text start="174.52" dur="3.9">her YouTube channel on her YouTube</text>
  <text start="176.44" dur="3.6">channel what she does is she talks about</text>
  <text start="178.42" dur="3.9">her life as a survivor and how it</text>
  <text start="180.04" dur="6.41">connects to what&amp;#39;s going on in the world</text>
  <text start="182.32" dur="6.6">so I just wanted to do that for her and</text>
  <text start="186.45" dur="5.23">hallelujah that&amp;#39;s the introduction for</text>
  <text start="188.92" dur="5.01">that video okay now there are some</text>
  <text start="191.68" dur="4.86">stories that I&amp;#39;ve become backlogged on</text>
  <text start="193.93" dur="4.5">because of how sick I was last week and</text>
  <text start="196.54" dur="3.09">I want to go back sort of in time and</text>
  <text start="198.43" dur="4.08">cover some of these because they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="199.63" dur="7.47">very significant so this one was from</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="7.44">July 21st 2019 hundreds of pentacon</text>
  <text start="207.1" dur="5.13">officials caught running child porn</text>
  <text start="209.95" dur="4.92">network on official Defense Department</text>
  <text start="212.23" dur="4.71">computers the problem of government</text>
  <text start="214.87" dur="4.44">agents viewing horrific images and</text>
  <text start="216.94" dur="4.079">videos of child pornography on official</text>
  <text start="219.31" dur="4.26">Department of Defense computers have</text>
  <text start="221.019" dur="4.47">gotten so out of hand that bipartisan</text>
  <text start="223.57" dur="3.11">legislation has been introduced to curb</text>
  <text start="225.489" dur="4.171">the practice</text>
  <text start="226.68" dur="5.619">representative Abigail Spann burger and</text>
  <text start="229.66" dur="4.47">Mark meadows introduced a legislation</text>
  <text start="232.299" dur="4.711">earlier this month meant to halt the</text>
  <text start="234.13" dur="6.24">epidemic of government employees viewing</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="5.96">and sharing child porn over DoD</text>
  <text start="240.37" dur="6.03">networking devices this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="242.97" dur="5.98">stunning I mean I try not to use the</text>
  <text start="246.4" dur="5.58">word unbelievable because it&amp;#39;s like I</text>
  <text start="248.95" dur="5.069">guess I should believe it now but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.98" dur="4.53">like I just appeal back into the layer</text>
  <text start="254.019" dur="4.59">and it&amp;#39;s even more horrific and shocking</text>
  <text start="256.51" dur="4.62">than before according to a report in the</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="3.831">hill the end national defense network</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="3.29">abuse</text>
  <text start="262.44" dur="4.47">and network abuse was introduced in the</text>
  <text start="264.42" dur="5.04">wake of an investigation called Project</text>
  <text start="266.91" dur="4.62">flicker carried out by US Immigration</text>
  <text start="269.46" dur="5.25">and Customs Enforcement this</text>
  <text start="271.53" dur="5.67">investigation identified over 5,000</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="5.4">individuals including many affiliated</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="5.79">with the DoD who are subscribed to child</text>
  <text start="280.11" dur="4.92">porn websites the investigation was</text>
  <text start="282.99" dur="4.2">conducted by the Pentagon&amp;#39;s defense</text>
  <text start="285.03" dur="4.11">Criminal Investigative Service and it</text>
  <text start="287.19" dur="4.68">netted hundreds of suspects who worked</text>
  <text start="289.14" dur="5.1">for and are affiliated with the DoD let</text>
  <text start="291.87" dur="4.35">that sink in hundreds of government</text>
  <text start="294.24" dur="4.83">employees are using taxpayer-funded</text>
  <text start="296.22" dur="5.96">official VOD networks and computers to</text>
  <text start="299.07" dur="5.4">view and share child pornography</text>
  <text start="302.18" dur="6.16">essentially running a child porn network</text>
  <text start="304.47" dur="5.4">on a government system the epidemic of</text>
  <text start="308.34" dur="3.24">child pornography has gotten so out of</text>
  <text start="309.87" dur="3.54">control that these people now feel</text>
  <text start="311.58" dur="4.08">comfortable enough to use official</text>
  <text start="313.41" dur="3.06">computers and networks they know are</text>
  <text start="315.66" dur="2.34">being monitored</text>
  <text start="316.47" dur="3.9">but apparently know they won&amp;#39;t get in</text>
  <text start="318" dur="4.71">trouble to access and share this</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="4.41">horrifying content according to the hill</text>
  <text start="322.71" dur="4.2">the end network abuse Act would require</text>
  <text start="324.78" dur="4.5">the Pentagon to enter an agreements with</text>
  <text start="326.91" dur="4.41">groups including law enforcement child</text>
  <text start="329.28" dur="3.9">protection services social services and</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="4.44">trauma-informed health care providers in</text>
  <text start="333.18" dur="4.82">order to cut down or halt the spread and</text>
  <text start="335.76" dur="4.86">impact of these images on DoD networks</text>
  <text start="338" dur="4.6">the bill would also upgrade the training</text>
  <text start="340.62" dur="4.41">and technical expertise of the military</text>
  <text start="342.6" dur="5.94">organizations involved in investigating</text>
  <text start="345.03" dur="5.28">these types of crimes illustrating just</text>
  <text start="348.54" dur="4.29">how horrific the problem of</text>
  <text start="350.31" dur="4.77">government-sponsored child porn networks</text>
  <text start="352.83" dur="4.47">has become according to the National</text>
  <text start="355.08" dur="4.41">Criminal Justice training center one of</text>
  <text start="357.3" dur="7.23">the groups back in the bill the DoD&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="359.49" dur="7.56">network is ranked 19th 19th out of 3,000</text>
  <text start="364.53" dur="7.2">for the worst child exploitation</text>
  <text start="367.05" dur="6.24">networks in the country oh my goodness</text>
  <text start="371.73" dur="3.66">the notion that the Department of</text>
  <text start="373.29" dur="4.56">Defense&amp;#39;s Network and Pentagon issued</text>
  <text start="375.39" dur="4.68">computers may be used to view create or</text>
  <text start="377.85" dur="5.04">circulate such horrifying images is a</text>
  <text start="380.07" dur="5">shameful disgrace and one we must fight</text>
  <text start="382.89" dur="4.5">head-on Spann Berger said in a statement</text>
  <text start="385.07" dur="4.3">Mark Meadows also added that</text>
  <text start="387.39" dur="5.21">peer-to-peer trading of child</text>
  <text start="389.37" dur="5.34">pornography is unacceptable practice is</text>
  <text start="392.6" dur="4.629">unacceptable practice and</text>
  <text start="394.71" dur="4.62">agencies cannot allow their networks to</text>
  <text start="397.229" dur="4.41">become a platform for it yes thank you</text>
  <text start="399.33" dur="4.649">mark meadows the idea that the</text>
  <text start="401.639" dur="3.541">government has to propose legislation to</text>
  <text start="403.979" dur="3.391">stop the government from using</text>
  <text start="405.18" dur="3.57">government resources to share and</text>
  <text start="407.37" dur="3.69">traffic and child pornography</text>
  <text start="408.75" dur="3.6">pornography is chilling yeah absolutely</text>
  <text start="411.06" dur="2.699">why do they even have to pass</text>
  <text start="412.35" dur="3.39">legislation why can&amp;#39;t they just go in</text>
  <text start="413.759" dur="6.151">and shut this down that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s my big</text>
  <text start="415.74" dur="5.76">question however as TFTP has reported</text>
  <text start="419.91" dur="4.17">child predators within the government</text>
  <text start="421.5" dur="4.289">are share are anything but rare much of</text>
  <text start="424.08" dur="3.63">it has to do with the priority of funds</text>
  <text start="425.789" dur="4.56">going to other crimes instead of</text>
  <text start="427.71" dur="4.019">protecting children sadly the funding of</text>
  <text start="430.349" dur="3.75">the prevention of child sex trafficking</text>
  <text start="431.729" dur="4.351">is but a drop in the box of the bucket</text>
  <text start="434.099" dur="4.44">to the 51 billion spent annually</text>
  <text start="436.08" dur="4.41">fighting a futile and immoral drug war</text>
  <text start="438.539" dur="4.051">perhaps if the u.s. cared more about</text>
  <text start="440.49" dur="4.14">saving children from exploitation and</text>
  <text start="442.59" dur="4.079">trafficking and less about kidnapping</text>
  <text start="444.63" dur="3.87">caging and killing people over arbitrary</text>
  <text start="446.669" dur="3.301">substances they choose to put in their</text>
  <text start="448.5" dur="4.65">own bodies this epidemic level of</text>
  <text start="449.97" dur="5.31">pedophilia could be curbed well I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="453.15" dur="4.59">sure if I told you that I mean I the</text>
  <text start="455.28" dur="4.379">drug war is important but I do agree</text>
  <text start="457.74" dur="5.85">that the child sex trafficking is much</text>
  <text start="459.659" dur="6.211">much much much more important however as</text>
  <text start="463.59" dur="4.199">the three-three as the freethought</text>
  <text start="465.87" dur="4.049">project has reported numerous times and</text>
  <text start="467.789" dur="3.75">as this recent bill exposes many of</text>
  <text start="469.919" dur="3.271">these sickos hold positions of power</text>
  <text start="471.539" dur="3.75">within are high levels of the government</text>
  <text start="473.19" dur="4.74">they have an incentive to protect their</text>
  <text start="475.289" dur="4.681">operation and can do so using the many</text>
  <text start="477.93" dur="6.329">pedophiles within law enforcement in</text>
  <text start="479.97" dur="6.84">government as their minions in case</text>
  <text start="484.259" dur="4.65">after case the three excuse means the</text>
  <text start="486.81" dur="4.139">free thought project reports on</text>
  <text start="488.909" dur="3.661">horrifying instances of child sex rings</text>
  <text start="490.949" dur="3.96">that were allowed to go on for decades</text>
  <text start="492.57" dur="4.409">because politicians including heads of</text>
  <text start="494.909" dur="4.111">states policemen encouragement clergymen</text>
  <text start="496.979" dur="7.321">and others were all in on the sick game</text>
  <text start="499.02" dur="9.079">in fact as the 2017 Netflix series the</text>
  <text start="504.3" dur="6.33">keepers by the way do not get Netflix</text>
  <text start="508.099" dur="5.05">they promote pedophilia as well I have a</text>
  <text start="510.63" dur="5.519">I have a couple videos on this one from</text>
  <text start="513.149" dur="4.38">last fall and one more recently but the</text>
  <text start="516.149" dur="3.39">keepers set out to launch an</text>
  <text start="517.529" dur="3.481">investigation into a murder cold case it</text>
  <text start="519.539" dur="3.81">soon became much deeper because of the</text>
  <text start="521.01" dur="4.199">high level pedophilia it revealed the</text>
  <text start="523.349" dur="3.99">story exposed a concerted effort to</text>
  <text start="525.209" dur="3.07">conceal widespread rape and sexual abuse</text>
  <text start="527.339" dur="4">committed</text>
  <text start="528.279" dur="4.711">my key off school chaplain and counselor</text>
  <text start="531.339" dur="3.48">father Joseph man school as well as</text>
  <text start="532.99" dur="4.98">other clergy police and a local</text>

  <text start="539.379" dur="3.661">interviews of former child sex</text>
  <text start="541.12" dur="3.42">trafficking victims who&amp;#39;ve all noted</text>
  <text start="543.04" dur="3.149">that they had nowhere to go as police</text>
  <text start="544.54" dur="4.709">and high-level politicians all took</text>
  <text start="546.189" dur="4.71">place in the abuse hopefully as the</text>
  <text start="549.249" dur="2.94">government&amp;#39;s war on drugs continues to</text>
  <text start="550.899" dur="3.151">crumble people will wake up to the fact</text>
  <text start="552.189" dur="3.421">that rescuing a child from a rapist is</text>
  <text start="554.05" dur="2.699">far more important than catching some</text>
  <text start="555.61" dur="4.289">dude smoking a plant</text>
  <text start="556.749" dur="4.231">hopefully okay well yeah I agree with</text>
  <text start="559.899" dur="2.91">that as well it&amp;#39;s not nearly as</text>
  <text start="560.98" dur="3.779">important as as marijuana although the</text>
  <text start="562.809" dur="4.26">drug war doesn&amp;#39;t just involve marijuana</text>
  <text start="564.759" dur="4.14">it involves hard drugs like crack</text>
  <text start="567.069" dur="4.801">cocaine and heroin and things we do not</text>
  <text start="568.899" dur="5.221">want on our streets okay so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="571.87" dur="4.56">totally agree totally with this article</text>
  <text start="574.12" dur="4.92">but I like how it exposes all this and</text>
  <text start="576.43" dur="5.159">this is just absolutely sickening phrase</text>
  <text start="579.04" dur="4.709">yeah that mark Meadows and Abigail Spann</text>
  <text start="581.589" dur="3.75">burger so spam burgers a Democrat of</text>
  <text start="583.749" dur="3.51">course we know mark Meadows he&amp;#39;s a hero</text>
  <text start="585.339" dur="4.591">he&amp;#39;s a Republican so this is a a</text>

  <text start="872.029" dur="6.06">has seen my son or spoken to him it</text>
  <text start="875.809" dur="3.63">would appear as though CPS separated</text>
  <text start="878.089" dur="3.09">young Michael from his loving family</text>
  <text start="879.439" dur="4.95">simply because he represents yet another</text>
