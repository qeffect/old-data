  <text start="11.28" dur="5.7">this is the final putt and in this part</text>
  <text start="14.009" dur="4.921">one to explore something that I touched</text>
  <text start="16.98" dur="4.799">on in an article that I wrote at the</text>
  <text start="18.93" dur="4.2">beginning of Hebrew new year this</text>
  <text start="21.779" dur="7.201">article is called prophetic implications</text>
  <text start="23.13" dur="7.92">for 2013 and 2017 and I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="28.98" dur="5.34">read the whole article here you can go</text>
  <text start="31.05" dur="6.36">read it yourself but there is a theme</text>
  <text start="34.32" dur="4.47">that I want to begin this video with and</text>
  <text start="37.41" dur="2.669">that theme is touched upon in this</text>
  <text start="38.79" dur="6.15">article called a third year of</text>
  <text start="40.079" dur="7.351">tribulation says however from a v2013 to</text>
  <text start="44.94" dur="4.83">a view 2014 the first trumpet should</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="5.01">completely and totally manifest on earth</text>
  <text start="49.77" dur="4.89">as the third deck creation week saw the</text>
  <text start="52.44" dur="4.049">blossoming of vegetation and greenery</text>
  <text start="54.66" dur="3.809">across the earth the third of</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="4.261">tribulation will see the destruction by</text>
  <text start="58.469" dur="4.711">fire of a third of the trees and all</text>
  <text start="60.75" dur="3.989">green grass across the earth I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="3.6">becoming more and more convinced the</text>
  <text start="64.739" dur="4.471">first trumpet is describing nuclear war</text>
  <text start="66.78" dur="5.1">as it mentions hail and blood mingled</text>
  <text start="69.21" dur="4.979">with fire when an atomic cloud holes in</text>
  <text start="71.88" dur="4.08">up on itself it immediately spits out</text>
  <text start="74.189" dur="4.021">pulverized white chunks of whatever</text>
  <text start="75.96" dur="5.4">material was blown up in the blast both</text>
  <text start="78.21" dur="5.04">biological blood and non-biological this</text>
  <text start="81.36" dur="4.11">global nuclear war will finally cause</text>
  <text start="83.25" dur="4.59">the first third and fifth seals to fully</text>
  <text start="85.47" dur="3.66">manifest and without doubt the fourth</text>
  <text start="87.84" dur="4.68">seal and third trumpet will no longer</text>
  <text start="89.13" dur="4.8">before shadows but stark realities what</text>
  <text start="92.52" dur="3.12">is amazing is the name of the seals</text>
  <text start="93.93" dur="3.93">trumpets and bowls are tied up to the</text>
  <text start="95.64" dur="3.39">seven days of creation thus causing them</text>
  <text start="97.86" dur="3.93">not to burst forth in chronological</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="4.589">order we see that in fact first trumpet</text>
  <text start="101.79" dur="3.84">really is the first event that fully</text>
  <text start="103.619" dur="4.981">manifests on earth setting everything</text>
  <text start="105.63" dur="6.12">else in motion this makes geopolitical a</text>
  <text start="108.6" dur="5.28">prophetic sense as well after all if the</text>
  <text start="111.75" dur="6.06">antenna SIA truly is going to emerge in</text>
  <text start="113.88" dur="5.79">early 2014 and if the two witnesses are</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="4.83">going to gain their ministry on land at</text>
  <text start="119.67" dur="4.53">2014 something very dramatic must happen</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="3.96">in order to pave the way for those</text>
  <text start="124.2" dur="4.529">events the first trumpet will cause a</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="3.99">global shake-up by fire that will</text>
  <text start="128.729" dur="3.961">provide the perfect impetus for the</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="7.05">needed perfect events</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="8.58">so I want to talk about that I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="137.64" dur="7.14">in this article that because of eve 2013</text>
  <text start="141.27" dur="7.23">the spring of 2013 to a v2014 the spring</text>
  <text start="144.78" dur="4.71">of 2014 is the third year of the final</text>
  <text start="148.5" dur="3.48">seven years the third year of</text>
  <text start="149.49" dur="5.01">tribulation that just like in the third</text>
  <text start="151.98" dur="5.61">day of creation where the trees in the</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="6.48">grass were trio the third trumpet will</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="7.35">blast forth sometime this year between</text>
  <text start="160.98" dur="6.96">AB eve 2013 and of eve 2014 and that</text>
  <text start="164.94" dur="6.87">this first trumpet global nuclear war</text>
  <text start="167.94" dur="5.7">will be a shake-up that will allow the</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="5.73">necessary prophetic things to come forth</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="5.88">in early 2014 such as the great delusion</text>
  <text start="177.54" dur="6.18">that I talked about in the first two</text>
  <text start="179.52" dur="6.48">videos of this series so what if this</text>
  <text start="183.72" dur="5.04">shake up this first trumpet global</text>
  <text start="186" dur="6.03">nuclear war caused by what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="7.26">Syria okay so I want to go and explore</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="8.7">that right there are some websites that</text>
  <text start="196.02" dur="6.36">I want to take a look at and these are</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="3.81">lines from debka file they were</text>
  <text start="202.38" dur="4.92">yesterday and today yesterday from jun</text>
  <text start="204.54" dur="5.13">18th is EU 80 have delivered shipments</text>
  <text start="207.3" dur="5.34">of weapons to syrian rebels and South</text>
  <text start="209.67" dur="6.9">Syria and the Aleppo region and the</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="6.3">today on jun 19th Russia Marines Russian</text>
  <text start="216.57" dur="6.21">Marines and air power heading for Syria</text>
  <text start="218.94" dur="5.67">by ships dude Western intervention okay</text>
  <text start="222.78" dur="3.959">so a lot of people have been saying that</text>
  <text start="224.61" dur="6.629">Syria is basically quickly becoming</text>
  <text start="226.739" dur="7.771">known as a proxy war where Russia and</text>
  <text start="231.239" dur="6.301">China and Iran are backing Assad regime</text>
  <text start="234.51" dur="5.72">in Syria and Europe and the United</text>
  <text start="237.54" dur="5.19">States and NATO are backing the</text>
  <text start="240.23" dur="5.86">Islamists and rebels that are fighting</text>
  <text start="242.73" dur="5.94">against asam&amp;#39;s fighting against Assad&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="5.07">regime so they see this proxy war</text>
  <text start="248.67" dur="4.56">beginning to develop what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="251.16" dur="4.14">is that the beginning of this year the</text>
  <text start="253.23" dur="5.91">beginning of this Hebrew year which was</text>
  <text start="255.3" dur="6.179">April of 2013 we saw some rising</text>
  <text start="259.14" dur="3.87">tensions going on in North Korea between</text>
  <text start="261.479" dur="4.181">North Korea and South Korea now things</text>
  <text start="263.01" dur="7.29">are sort of seemingly quieted down</text>
  <text start="265.66" dur="7.89">but just today we have the Tory here and</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="7">if this interval load here here we go</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="6.81">North Korea damaged Syrian missiles so</text>
  <text start="277.3" dur="8.4">here we have an article about North</text>
  <text start="280.36" dur="7.53">Korea helping Assad regime says a</text>
  <text start="285.7" dur="4.17">delegation of North Korean technician</text>
  <text start="287.89" dur="4.38">thrive in Syria to help rebuild the</text>
  <text start="289.87" dur="4.02">country&amp;#39;s missile capabilities including</text>
  <text start="292.27" dur="3.42">those damaged in previous Israeli</text>
  <text start="293.89" dur="3.69">bombardment bombardment according to</text>
  <text start="295.69" dur="4.53">them formed Middle Eastern security</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="4.38">officials speaking to wnd the goal is</text>
  <text start="300.22" dur="3.48">for Syria to maintain enough missiles to</text>
  <text start="301.96" dur="4.05">fire hundreds or even thousands of</text>
  <text start="303.7" dur="4.65">missiles at the same time into Israel&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.01" dur="3.81">to overall overwhelm the Jewish state&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.35" dur="3.78">missile defense batteries in any feature</text>
  <text start="309.82" dur="3.33">tap the official said okay I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="312.13" dur="3.87">to go into the whole article but</text>
  <text start="313.15" dur="4.17">basically we see that North Korea and</text>
  <text start="316" dur="2.46">the tensions that were going on earlier</text>
  <text start="317.32" dur="4.29">in the year between north and south</text>

  <text start="324.04" dur="3.93">playing into what&amp;#39;s building toward</text>
  <text start="326.41" dur="4.47">where i think is going to be a global</text>

  <text start="330.88" dur="8.88">will so you see North Korea as well</text>

  <text start="339.76" dur="10.62">of a proxy war um let&amp;#39;s explore that um</text>
  <text start="346.44" dur="5.59">and how that relates to a world war this</text>

  <text start="410.379" dur="4.201">acceptable to Russian President Vladimir</text>

  <text start="652.18" dur="5.34">doesn&amp;#39;t occur too often what do i mean</text>
  <text start="655.15" dur="5.37">by that if you go to the next major</text>
  <text start="657.52" dur="6.36">feast which is yom teruah on october six</text>

  <text start="702.53" dur="4.65">16 weeks through june july august and</text>
  <text start="704.96" dur="5.67">September now what&amp;#39;s interesting about</text>
  <text start="707.18" dur="7.35">the number 16 is if you open up your</text>
  <text start="710.63" dur="7.02">Bible and you count the profits in the</text>
  <text start="714.53" dur="7.76">Tanakh in the Old Testament you have</text>
  <text start="717.65" dur="11.4">isaiah one jeremiah to Ezekiel three</text>
  <text start="722.29" dur="11.98">Daniel for Hosea five Joel six Amos 70</text>

  <text start="745.67" dur="5.57">exactly 16 profits in the Tanakh</text>
  <text start="751.48" dur="6.1">signifying that something major major</text>
  <text start="754.49" dur="6.69">major Lee prophetic is going to occur</text>
  <text start="757.58" dur="6.45">between these two mirror image bookmarks</text>
  <text start="761.18" dur="6.87">of the Sabbath on june fifteenth and SH</text>
  <text start="764.03" dur="9.33">a boat and the Sabbath on october fifth</text>
  <text start="768.05" dur="7.59">and yom teruah on october six it seems</text>
  <text start="773.36" dur="5.97">to me and again this is just speculation</text>
  <text start="775.64" dur="7.35">on my part but it seems to me that yah</text>
  <text start="779.33" dur="6.9">is showing a very clear demarcation of</text>
  <text start="782.99" dur="6.9">time in which this global nuclear war</text>
  <text start="786.23" dur="8.37">this world war will erupt sometime over</text>
  <text start="789.89" dur="6.57">these next 16 weeks since we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="794.6" dur="3.96">for the first trumpet which is going to</text>
  <text start="796.46" dur="5.79">basically result</text>
  <text start="798.56" dur="6.66">in a third of all trees and grass being</text>
  <text start="802.25" dur="5.779">burned up excuse me a third of the trees</text>
  <text start="805.22" dur="5.22">and all green grass being burned up</text>
  <text start="808.029" dur="6.671">since we&amp;#39;re looking for that that sign</text>
  <text start="810.44" dur="6.51">it seems like it would happen on the</text>
  <text start="814.7" dur="3.96">Feast of Trumpets I mean after all it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="816.95" dur="3.75">the feasts of trumpets so wouldn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="818.66" dur="4.74">first trumpet blast on the visa trumpets</text>
  <text start="820.7" dur="6.27">or made what we&amp;#39;ll see is over the next</text>
  <text start="823.4" dur="6.18">16 weeks you know things build up and</text>
  <text start="826.97" dur="4.41">then climax on october six again that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="829.58" dur="3.18">speculation but this is just something i</text>
  <text start="831.38" dur="4.05">wanted to point out i think it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="832.76" dur="8.37">very interesting in any case we know it</text>
  <text start="835.43" dur="9.72">we&amp;#39;re getting close i do believe that</text>
  <text start="841.13" dur="6.75">this syrian mess is going directly lead</text>
  <text start="845.15" dur="6.8">to this global shake up by fire because</text>
