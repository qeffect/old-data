  <text start="26.16" dur="5.279">explain toward the top we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="29.76" dur="5.43">start in Ephesians 2 starting in verse</text>
  <text start="31.439" dur="6.111">11 where it says we&amp;#39;re wherefore</text>
  <text start="35.19" dur="4.65">remember that ye being in time past</text>
  <text start="37.55" dur="4.48">Gentiles in the flesh who are called</text>
  <text start="39.84" dur="3.87">uncircumcision by that which is called</text>
  <text start="42.03" dur="4.2">the circumcision in the flesh made by</text>
  <text start="43.71" dur="4.89">hand that at that time ye were without</text>
  <text start="46.23" dur="4.68">Messiah being aliens from the</text>
  <text start="48.6" dur="4.68">Commonwealth of Israel and strangers</text>
  <text start="50.91" dur="5.21">from the covenants of promise having no</text>
  <text start="53.28" dur="8.34">hope and without Yahweh in the world</text>
  <text start="56.12" dur="9.69">stop there okay so Ephesians 2 has a</text>
  <text start="61.62" dur="8.249">very basic theme very basic premise and</text>
  <text start="65.81" dur="6.73">basically what Paul is saying is hey</text>
  <text start="69.869" dur="6.781">look you believers who are once called</text>
  <text start="72.54" dur="6.689">Gentiles and that&amp;#39;s the past tense you</text>
  <text start="76.65" dur="4.98">were once called Gentiles implying that</text>
  <text start="79.229" dur="6.291">you&amp;#39;re no longer thought of or</text>
  <text start="81.63" dur="6.9">considered a Gentile but now you are</text>
  <text start="85.52" dur="5.41">considered an Israelite you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="88.53" dur="4.56">considered a Hebrew you were once</text>
  <text start="90.93" dur="4.17">estranged from the Covenant of promises</text>
  <text start="93.09" dur="6.12">now what is that what is the covenants</text>
  <text start="95.1" dur="7.17">of promise well my friends the covenants</text>
  <text start="99.21" dur="8.07">of promise are all the Johnson titles in</text>
  <text start="102.27" dur="8.04">the Torah along the serving Israel&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="107.28" dur="5.61">Yahweh now you say well how can you say</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="3.949">that the Torah is what Paul refers to</text>
  <text start="112.89" dur="4.409">when he says the covenants of promise</text>
  <text start="114.259" dur="7.451">because if you look at the Torah that</text>
  <text start="117.299" dur="5.61">the Torah is a covenant okay it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="3.24">covenant it&amp;#39;s a binding agreement</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="4.831">between two parties Yahweh and his</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="6.39">people Israel and it contains promises</text>
  <text start="127.74" dur="5.74">for example if you honor your father and</text>
  <text start="131.34" dur="6.16">mother you are given the promise that</text>
  <text start="133.48" dur="6.33">you will have long life if you keep the</text>
  <text start="137.5" dur="4.08">commandments the Torah you are promised</text>
  <text start="139.81" dur="4.289">to have none of these diseases from</text>
  <text start="141.58" dur="4.68">Egypt touching you so for every time you</text>
  <text start="144.099" dur="4.801">keep the precepts contained within the</text>
  <text start="146.26" dur="4.71">the covenant with in Torah you are given</text>
  <text start="148.9" dur="4.919">promises or promise so that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="150.97" dur="4.95">Torah is the covenants of promise that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.819" dur="3.871">what it is when Paul says covenants of</text>
  <text start="155.92" dur="6.39">promise he&amp;#39;s referring to the Torah of</text>
  <text start="157.69" dur="6.99">Israel continuing on it says but now in</text>
  <text start="162.31" dur="5.539">Yahshua HaMashiach you who were</text>
  <text start="164.68" dur="9.24">sometimes were far off are made nigh by</text>
  <text start="167.849" dur="8.14">the blood of Messiah okay so Paul says</text>
  <text start="173.92" dur="7.2">look you were once Gentiles you were</text>
  <text start="175.989" dur="7.441">once you were once estranged you were</text>
  <text start="181.12" dur="3.479">aliens you were not a part of the</text>
  <text start="183.43" dur="2.79">Commonwealth of Israel you were</text>
  <text start="184.599" dur="3.631">strangers from the covenants of promise</text>
  <text start="186.22" dur="4.71">from the Torah having no hope without</text>
  <text start="188.23" dur="5.7">yow in the world but through the blood</text>
  <text start="190.93" dur="7.26">of Messiah that estrangement from the</text>
  <text start="193.93" dur="6.929">Torah from Israel from all the covenants</text>
  <text start="198.19" dur="8.01">of promise from the jots and tittles of</text>
  <text start="200.859" dur="9.121">Torah has been abolished that means that</text>
  <text start="206.2" dur="6.93">we get to serve the Yahweh of Israel we</text>
  <text start="209.98" dur="5.46">get to serve and obey the Torah of</text>
  <text start="213.13" dur="6.21">Israel we get to be partakers of the</text>
  <text start="215.44" dur="6.419">Commonwealth of Israel we are heirs of</text>
  <text start="219.34" dur="6.39">the covenants of promise we can now keep</text>
  <text start="221.859" dur="6.871">the whole Torah just as the rest of the</text>
  <text start="225.73" dur="8.879">believing Jews for the blood of Messiah</text>
  <text start="228.73" dur="10.05">paves our way to do so now the bible</text>
  <text start="234.609" dur="5.341">does not change Yahweh himself who</text>
  <text start="238.78" dur="2.819">commissioned his people to write the</text>
  <text start="239.95" dur="3.96">Bible he is the same yesterday today and</text>
  <text start="241.599" dur="4.14">forever so what we&amp;#39;re reading about it</text>
  <text start="243.91" dur="5.719">in Ephesians 2 is nothing new this was</text>
  <text start="245.739" dur="7.83">the same rule in the Mosaic Covenant</text>
  <text start="249.629" dur="7.241">remember Rahab the harlot remember Ruth</text>
  <text start="253.569" dur="6.061">the Moabite asst remember the Egyptians</text>
  <text start="256.87" dur="5.07">who left with Israel from Egypt and</text>
  <text start="259.63" dur="5.73">we&amp;#39;re part of the mixed multitude under</text>
  <text start="261.94" dur="5.31">mache and Aaron remember these examples</text>
  <text start="265.36" dur="5.43">of pagan Gentiles throughout</text>
  <text start="267.25" dur="6.21">Tunak and because they chose to place</text>
  <text start="270.79" dur="5.49">their faith in the coming Messiah and is</text>
  <text start="273.46" dur="5.01">not yet shed blood they were grafted</text>
  <text start="276.28" dur="5.22">into Israel and were no longer</text>
  <text start="278.47" dur="6.21">considered Gentiles but they were</text>
  <text start="281.5" dur="4.44">considered one with Israel and when they</text>
  <text start="284.68" dur="3.24">were considered one with Israel when</text>
  <text start="285.94" dur="3.75">they were grafted in they were expected</text>
  <text start="287.92" dur="4.17">and required to keep every last judel</text>
  <text start="289.69" dur="5.58">jot and tittle vittoria just as if they</text>
  <text start="292.09" dur="4.77">had been born in Israel from day one so</text>
  <text start="295.27" dur="4.14">this provision was in the Torah and</text>
  <text start="296.86" dur="7.89">we&amp;#39;re reading about that same provision</text>
  <text start="299.41" dur="7.14">now here in Ephesians to Ephesians 2</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="3.96">shows us that this provision in Torah to</text>
  <text start="306.55" dur="4.02">allow Gentiles to become Israelites to</text>
  <text start="308.71" dur="4.11">allow them to become Hebrews this</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="5.43">provision never passed away Yahweh is</text>
  <text start="312.82" dur="5.13">the same yesterday today and forever we</text>
  <text start="316" dur="3.9">continue on in Ephesians 2 for he is our</text>
  <text start="317.95" dur="4.2">peace who has made us both one and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.9" dur="5.43">broken down the middle wall of partition</text>
  <text start="322.15" dur="5.76">between us in other words through</text>
  <text start="325.33" dur="4.86">Messiah we are all considered Israelites</text>
  <text start="327.91" dur="3.99">now and thus we&amp;#39;re all required to obey</text>
  <text start="330.19" dur="4.44">the Torah given to Israel there is no</text>
  <text start="331.9" dur="4.68">class warfare no exclusivity that the</text>
  <text start="334.63" dur="4.38">wicked Pharisee achill Jews tried to</text>
  <text start="336.58" dur="4.74">establish rather the written Torah is</text>
  <text start="339.01" dur="5.07">clear that a Gentile may be gradual and</text>
  <text start="341.32" dur="4.8">that once the Gentiles grafted in by the</text>
  <text start="344.08" dur="3.69">blood of Messiah he is no longer</text>
  <text start="346.12" dur="5.34">considered a Gentile but he is now a</text>
  <text start="347.77" dur="6.209">fellow Israelite also expected to obey</text>
  <text start="351.46" dur="6.03">the precepts in Torah to become part of</text>
  <text start="353.979" dur="6.571">the covenants of promise the partition</text>
  <text start="357.49" dur="4.83">was destroyed by Torah and now that tour</text>
  <text start="360.55" dur="4.02">has been sprinkled in yahshua&amp;#39;s blood</text>
  <text start="362.32" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re reminded that this partition is</text>
  <text start="364.57" dur="4.44">still destroyed remember back in the</text>
  <text start="366.79" dur="3.93">tanakh when Moe che when he first gave</text>
  <text start="369.01" dur="4.38">the book of the law the torah to the</text>
  <text start="370.72" dur="5.36">people what did he do before he gave it</text>
  <text start="373.39" dur="6.45">to them he sprinkled the book in blood</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="5.35">he took the blood of the of the slain</text>
  <text start="379.84" dur="2.82">animal he sprinkled that book with the</text>
  <text start="381.43" dur="3.63">blood and then he sprinkled the people</text>
  <text start="382.66" dur="5.37">with the blood this was a foreshadow of</text>
  <text start="385.06" dur="4.62">what Yahshua do by spilling his blood on</text>
  <text start="388.03" dur="4.5">the cross so we&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="389.68" dur="4.68">same thing Moshe ain&amp;#39;t taking that blood</text>
  <text start="392.53" dur="3.72">and sprinkling the book the taurah and</text>
  <text start="394.36" dur="6.09">then spelunking the people is the same</text>
  <text start="396.25" dur="4.8">it foreshadows the event that we look</text>
  <text start="400.45" dur="2.85">back</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="5.82">as when Yahshua himself was crucified</text>
  <text start="403.3" dur="5.64">and spilled his blood for us and what</text>
  <text start="406.87" dur="3.93">does this do it we continue reading</text>
  <text start="408.94" dur="7.439">Ephesians 2 having abolished in his</text>
  <text start="410.8" dur="7.89">flesh the enmity even against the law of</text>
  <text start="416.379" dur="4.951">Commandments contained in ordinances for</text>
  <text start="418.69" dur="6.599">to make himself of Twain one new man so</text>
  <text start="421.33" dur="7.35">making peace now people get tripped up</text>
  <text start="425.289" dur="6.241">by this first thinking oh look he he he</text>
  <text start="428.68" dur="4.229">abolished in his flesh the law of</text>
  <text start="431.53" dur="4.979">commandments no he abolished in his</text>
  <text start="432.909" dur="5.341">flesh the enmity against the law of</text>
  <text start="436.509" dur="5.011">Commandments contained Norton TSA&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="438.25" dur="6.569">in other words we had a natural enmity</text>
  <text start="441.52" dur="5.82">as Gentiles as unregenerate adenine a</text>
  <text start="444.819" dur="5.25">chiral enmity toward the Torah toward</text>
  <text start="447.34" dur="6.15">the commandments well he abolished that</text>
  <text start="450.069" dur="6.57">he abolished that enmity that we had he</text>
  <text start="453.49" dur="8.399">abolished the enmity that we had toward</text>
  <text start="456.639" dur="6.93">the Torah the enmity is not the law the</text>
  <text start="461.889" dur="3.33">law is not evil the law is holy and</text>
  <text start="463.569" dur="4.051">righteous and just according to Apostle</text>
  <text start="465.219" dur="4.44">Paul where the evil comes in is our</text>
  <text start="467.62" dur="3.289">enmity our natural enmity against the</text>
  <text start="469.659" dur="4.141">tour against the law that we all have</text>
  <text start="470.909" dur="6.461">before we fall in love with Yahweh but</text>
  <text start="473.8" dur="6.149">that enmity is removed by the cross the</text>
  <text start="477.37" dur="4.769">shed blood of his atonement should cause</text>
  <text start="479.949" dur="3.991">our hearts to break as you realize the</text>
  <text start="482.139" dur="3.78">love he&amp;#39;s given to us so that we no</text>
  <text start="483.94" dur="7.009">longer have enmity against the</text>
  <text start="485.919" dur="7.59">ordinances and the laws written Torah ok</text>
  <text start="490.949" dur="6.671">if this verse is actually saying that</text>
  <text start="493.509" dur="6.15">Yahweh through his flesh abolished the</text>
  <text start="497.62" dur="4.32">Torah the commandments then that means</text>
  <text start="499.659" dur="4.38">we can go murder and we can go commit</text>
  <text start="501.94" dur="3.689">adultery and we can steal because those</text>
  <text start="504.039" dur="2.731">are all ordinances found in the Torah</text>
  <text start="505.629" dur="7.95">and of course that doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="506.77" dur="9.809">sense um we are redeemed by yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.579" dur="5.551">blood right so another thing that he is</text>
  <text start="516.579" dur="4.32">put to death is that the commandments</text>
  <text start="519.13" dur="4.26">the ordinance is no longer condemn us</text>
  <text start="520.899" dur="4.5">there are there are there is</text>
  <text start="523.39" dur="3.93">condemnation that is brought upon an</text>
  <text start="525.399" dur="3.991">individual if he&amp;#39;s not in compliance</text>
  <text start="527.32" dur="5.78">with Torah that condemnation the Torah</text>
  <text start="529.39" dur="5.55">brings is abolished is destroyed and why</text>
  <text start="533.1" dur="4.72">why is it destroyed</text>
  <text start="534.94" dur="5.07">is it because the torah changes no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.82" dur="4.17">because we change because through the</text>
  <text start="540.01" dur="4.71">blood of Messiah His redemptive work we</text>
  <text start="541.99" dur="5.52">now have the power to obey everything in</text>
  <text start="544.72" dur="5.04">Torah we get this internal power from</text>
  <text start="547.51" dur="5.31">our precious Messiah and the indwelling</text>
  <text start="549.76" dur="4.98">of his Rucka Kadosh his Spirit teaches</text>
  <text start="552.82" dur="6.57">us to keep his Commandments to keep the</text>
  <text start="554.74" dur="8.31">law and because we keep the law we no</text>
  <text start="559.39" dur="6.5">longer disobey Torah so remember</text>
  <text start="563.05" dur="5.82">Ephesians 2 very very clearly teaches us</text>
  <text start="565.89" dur="5.77">that through the blood of Messiah we are</text>
  <text start="568.87" dur="5.13">now considered Israelites Hebrews we are</text>
  <text start="571.66" dur="4.74">no longer considered Gentiles that we</text>
  <text start="574" dur="4.23">now have the power to obey the Torah</text>
  <text start="576.4" dur="4.23">because we have the power to obey the</text>
