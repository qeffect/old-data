  <text start="66.869" dur="9.841">want to share with you last night I was</text>
  <text start="72.799" dur="6.43">standing outside and the moon decided</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="4.83">not to rise until much later so I was</text>
  <text start="79.229" dur="4.791">actually for the first time in the past</text>
  <text start="81.54" dur="9.509">few days able to see just the full</text>
  <text start="84.02" dur="11.919">splash of the stars up above and man it</text>
  <text start="91.049" dur="6.301">was it was incredible and I must have</text>
  <text start="95.939" dur="6.031">stood out there for probably an hour</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="6.9">just gazing up at Yahweh&amp;#39;s handiwork and</text>
  <text start="101.97" dur="6.27">all of a sudden the still small voice</text>
  <text start="104.25" dur="9.479">said start counting the stars I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="8.669">like what there&amp;#39;s too many said no count</text>
  <text start="113.729" dur="5.771">only the ones that are the brightest and</text>
  <text start="116.909" dur="7.181">so I started counting them</text>
  <text start="119.5" dur="6.39">I counted seven right in front of me and</text>
  <text start="124.09" dur="3.27">they literally formed a tabernacle iming</text>
  <text start="125.89" dur="5.22">and how to pointed top and everything</text>
  <text start="127.36" dur="9.51">and then like a string of pearls eight</text>
  <text start="131.11" dur="8.79">nine and ten just to the right and then</text>
  <text start="136.87" dur="9">next to that a little dipper like a</text>
  <text start="139.9" dur="9.66">clenched fist 11 12 13 14 I started</text>
  <text start="145.87" dur="7.14">thinking about the years 2001 to 2017</text>
  <text start="149.56" dur="6.99">and then I turned a little bit more and</text>
  <text start="153.01" dur="5.1">I saw the moon had not quite crested the</text>
  <text start="156.55" dur="3.3">trees you could see the moon glow but</text>
  <text start="158.11" dur="6.9">crowning the moon glow the two witnesses</text>
  <text start="159.85" dur="7.52">15 and 16 and then like a straight line</text>
  <text start="165.01" dur="6.36">right across the center of the sky right</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="9.52">above me the brightest star was number</text>
  <text start="171.37" dur="9.57">17 I don&amp;#39;t know I just kept thinking of</text>
  <text start="176.89" dur="9">the years 2001 to 2017 and yash or</text>
  <text start="180.94" dur="10.38">returning in 2017 it was pretty amazing</text>
  <text start="185.89" dur="9.21">one later that night I opened the</text>
  <text start="191.32" dur="6.419">scriptures and in second Kings chapter</text>
  <text start="195.1" dur="5.94">six verses one through seven I started</text>
  <text start="197.739" dur="7.351">reading about that story where you know</text>
  <text start="201.04" dur="5.46">the prophets are with Elijah and they</text>
  <text start="205.09" dur="3.119">have these wood beams and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="206.5" dur="2.82">to build dwelling places next to the</text>
  <text start="208.209" dur="4.53">garden and there&amp;#39;s all these references</text>
  <text start="209.32" dur="6.6">to wood beams and sticks and one of the</text>
  <text start="212.739" dur="5.521">prophets drops iron hammer into the</text>
  <text start="215.92" dur="3.96">water and he&amp;#39;s really upset about it</text>
  <text start="218.26" dur="5.28">because it was borrowed it wasn&amp;#39;t his</text>
  <text start="219.88" dur="5.91">and Elijah says calm down and he takes a</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="4.08">stick of wood cuts it down cast it into</text>
  <text start="225.79" dur="3.78">the water and the iron hammer floats</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="7.23">right to the top and they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="229.57" dur="7.199">retrieve it you know I was thinking</text>
  <text start="234.85" dur="5.91">about that and I just kept seeing the</text>
  <text start="236.769" dur="5.731">words beam and would and stick stick</text>
  <text start="240.76" dur="4.5">cast down and I kept thinking of the</text>
  <text start="242.5" dur="5">wood that Yahshua was crucified to to</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="5.01">the tree</text>
  <text start="247.5" dur="4.84">then the iron rose to the top and</text>
  <text start="250.27" dur="4.47">immediately I thought a psalm chapter 2</text>
  <text start="252.34" dur="5.1">where it says Yahshua upon a second</text>
  <text start="254.74" dur="6.48">return will shatter his enemies with a</text>
  <text start="257.44" dur="7.71">rod of iron like breaking the pieces of</text>
  <text start="261.22" dur="5.28">a Potter&amp;#39;s vessel I thought isn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="265.15" dur="5.1">cool right there in those first seven</text>
  <text start="266.5" dur="5.49">verses it&amp;#39;s like the first and second</text>
  <text start="270.25" dur="6.6">comings of Yahshua are right there</text>
  <text start="271.99" dur="6.81">embedded in the in the word anyway it</text>
  <text start="276.85" dur="3.83">was just very comforting and I just</text>
  <text start="278.8" dur="4.41">thought to myself I wonder how many</text>
  <text start="280.68" dur="5.83">prophetic pictures of the first and</text>
  <text start="283.21" dur="4.92">second return of Yahshua are all for the</text>
  <text start="286.51" dur="4.65">scriptures when we know the obvious ones</text>
  <text start="288.13" dur="5.37">but how many are just indebted in just</text>
  <text start="291.16" dur="3.63">the word pictures that are created by</text>
  <text start="293.5" dur="3.9">the language that&amp;#39;s used even though</text>
  <text start="294.79" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s not directly referring to the</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="4.47">Messiah of course all the scriptures the</text>
  <text start="300.1" dur="5.27">Torah starting from Genesis all go to</text>
  <text start="301.87" dur="5.549">Revelation I mean they all point toward</text>
  <text start="305.37" dur="5.79">Yahshua and they point toward the</text>
  <text start="307.419" dur="6.511">Messiah anyway it was just incredible</text>
  <text start="311.16" dur="5.35">I&amp;#39;ve been hiking this morning and just</text>
  <text start="313.93" dur="5.37">going through the various trails and</text>
  <text start="316.51" dur="6.06">just all the different places where</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="10.56">people are and it was just it was just</text>

  <text start="378.48" dur="6.24">tremble and shake but it blew so it</text>
