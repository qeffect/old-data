  <text start="9.389" dur="7.201">dark here on the west coast and the 14th</text>
  <text start="12.719" dur="6.541">day of a vivre has officially begun now</text>
  <text start="16.59" dur="4.38">this year in 2015 the Orthodox Jews</text>
  <text start="19.26" dur="4.08">actually don&amp;#39;t start the day of Passover</text>
  <text start="20.97" dur="4.41">until tomorrow night they&amp;#39;re a day off</text>
  <text start="23.34" dur="4.349">just because they go by a pre-calculated</text>
  <text start="25.38" dur="4.2">calendar based off al l of the 4th</text>
  <text start="27.689" dur="2.971">century or rather than the true biblical</text>
  <text start="29.58" dur="3.33">calendar you can find out more about</text>
  <text start="30.66" dur="6.32">that on my website but nevertheless</text>
  <text start="32.91" dur="7.169">tonight Thursday night April 2nd 2015</text>
  <text start="36.98" dur="5.23">the Passover day begins the 14th David</text>
  <text start="40.079" dur="4.23">Eve it starts tonight and when the Sun</text>
  <text start="42.21" dur="4.619">was down and darkness settled over the</text>
  <text start="44.309" dur="3.93">land that&amp;#39;s when Passover day started</text>
  <text start="46.829" dur="5.25">Passover goes from tonight until</text>
  <text start="48.239" dur="5.791">tomorrow night Friday night April 3rd it</text>
  <text start="52.079" dur="3.87">is tomorrow evening as the Sun is</text>
  <text start="54.03" dur="4.32">setting at Twilight that we are to have</text>
  <text start="55.949" dur="4.531">the Passover dinner as described in</text>
  <text start="58.35" dur="3.45">Exodus 12 where we eat the lamb the</text>
  <text start="60.48" dur="4.41">unleavened bread and the bitter herbs</text>
  <text start="61.8" dur="5.91">and you eat that at Twilight as the</text>
  <text start="64.89" dur="5.13">Passover day ends and it goes into the</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="4.17">first day of unleavened bread which</text>
  <text start="70.02" dur="3.779">begins tomorrow night as the Sabbath the</text>
  <text start="71.88" dur="3.39">weekly Sabbath begins first day of</text>
  <text start="73.799" dur="4.171">unleavened bread is also a high Sabbath</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="5.79">and that kicks off seven days of</text>
  <text start="77.97" dur="5.28">unleavened bread or Passover a week as I</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="3.51">like to call it the feast of firstfruits</text>
  <text start="83.25" dur="3.57">will be the morrow after the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="84.57" dur="4.65">within that feast of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="86.82" dur="4.799">seven days that starts tomorrow night</text>
  <text start="89.22" dur="4.7">now of course that falls on the Sun this</text>
  <text start="91.619" dur="4.68">upcoming Sunday the day after Shabbat</text>
  <text start="93.92" dur="4.449">and in the seventh day of unleavened</text>
  <text start="96.299" dur="4.291">bread the final high Sabbath of this</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="5.46">initial spring feast will be on April</text>
  <text start="100.59" dur="4.739">10th I wanted to first of all wish</text>
  <text start="103.829" dur="3.691">everyone a very happy Passover I</text>
  <text start="105.329" dur="5.43">selected this picture here because not</text>
  <text start="107.52" dur="5.19">only is it beautiful but it reminds me</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="3.451">of Passover because of the red wine but</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="4.29">I specifically chose this picture</text>
  <text start="114.21" dur="4.4">because you&amp;#39;ll notice the bread that is</text>
  <text start="117" dur="3.45">photographed in this picture is not</text>
  <text start="118.61" dur="4.63">unleavened bread it&amp;#39;s actually that that</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="5.269">breads all puffed up its 11th and I</text>
  <text start="123.24" dur="5.01">chose this picture on purpose because</text>
  <text start="125.719" dur="5.171">technically you are still allowed to</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="4.53">have leavened bread you can eat leavened</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="2.39">bread tonight this is the day of the</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="2.6">Passover</text>
  <text start="133.28" dur="5.13">the day in which we&amp;#39;re to clean out all</text>
  <text start="135.38" dur="4.65">of our leaven we are to slaughter the</text>
  <text start="138.41" dur="2.07">lamb and cook it and roast it over a</text>
  <text start="140.03" dur="2.31">fire</text>
  <text start="140.48" dur="3.839">so that&amp;#39;s today do it but technically</text>
  <text start="142.34" dur="4.29">the seven days of unleavened bread have</text>
  <text start="144.319" dur="5.281">not begun yet it is tomorrow night as</text>
  <text start="146.63" dur="4.56">darkness falls across the land that you</text>
  <text start="149.6" dur="5.25">were to make sure you have no leaven</text>
  <text start="151.19" dur="5.73">within any of your dwellings and that</text>
  <text start="154.85" dur="3.54">and that for the next seven days you</text>
  <text start="156.92" dur="2.64">don&amp;#39;t need unleavened bread but today on</text>
  <text start="158.39" dur="3.45">the day of the Passover you technically</text>
  <text start="159.56" dur="3.84">still can have leaven although it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="161.84" dur="5.399">probably not a good idea because we</text>
  <text start="163.4" dur="5.64">should be using this day as a Passover</text>
  <text start="167.239" dur="3.601">as a preparation day for the high</text>
  <text start="169.04" dur="3.66">Sabbath that begins the first day of</text>
  <text start="170.84" dur="3.21">unleavened bread so this is a day that</text>
  <text start="172.7" dur="4.08">we should be cleaning out all of our</text>
  <text start="174.05" dur="5.46">eleven in fact when I got home from work</text>
  <text start="176.78" dur="5.16">this afternoon I cleaned out all the</text>
  <text start="179.51" dur="4.44">leaven from my house I made sure no I</text>
  <text start="181.94" dur="3.57">had some bread and I had some chips with</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="2.85">leaven in it and I had some things in my</text>
  <text start="185.51" dur="3.54">cupboards so I went through my whole</text>
  <text start="186.8" dur="4.2">house and I did a full deep cleaning and</text>
  <text start="189.05" dur="3.81">I got all the leaven all the leaven</text>
  <text start="191" dur="3.209">products into a trash bag and I threw it</text>
  <text start="192.86" dur="2.82">out I wanted to make sure all the lovin</text>
  <text start="194.209" dur="3.451">and why do we do that to make sure we</text>
  <text start="195.68" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t accidentally eat any eleven during</text>
  <text start="197.66" dur="3.15">the seven days of unleavened bread and</text>
  <text start="199.28" dur="3.36">that also goes for things like baking</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="3.72">soda and baking powder these are things</text>
  <text start="202.64" dur="3.659">that maybe are not leaven in and of</text>
  <text start="204.53" dur="3.78">themselves but they really the only</text>
  <text start="206.299" dur="3.571">purpose they have is to is to cook them</text>
  <text start="208.31" dur="3.48">with leaven yeah I suppose you could use</text>
  <text start="209.87" dur="4.5">baking powders to brush your teeth or to</text>
  <text start="211.79" dur="4.74">clean but but I think it&amp;#39;s a good idea</text>
  <text start="214.37" dur="5.089">to throw those things out and in that</text>
  <text start="216.53" dur="5.31">way you have nothing to accidentally</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="3.791">allow you to sin in terms of eating</text>
  <text start="221.84" dur="2.73">leaven during those seven days of</text>
  <text start="223.25" dur="5.25">unleavened bread which is an important</text>
  <text start="224.57" dur="7.44">thing to obey I&amp;#39;m making this Passover</text>
  <text start="228.5" dur="5.01">as the Passover days beginning 14th day</text>
  <text start="232.01" dur="3.36">of Aviva&amp;#39;s beginning even though</text>
  <text start="233.51" dur="3.66">tomorrow night is the night that we have</text>
  <text start="235.37" dur="4.38">the actual Passover dinner the full</text>
  <text start="237.17" dur="4.289">Seder with the lamb the bitter herbs the</text>
  <text start="239.75" dur="5.15">unleavened bread maybe some Cara said if</text>
  <text start="241.459" dur="5.821">you make it the the grape juice or wine</text>
  <text start="244.9" dur="5.77">and we have the full dinner as subscribe</text>
  <text start="247.28" dur="5.489">the next is 12 it is tomorrow during the</text>
  <text start="250.67" dur="3.96">day that Yahshua was actually crucified</text>
  <text start="252.769" dur="3.361">actually it happens on Friday this year</text>
  <text start="254.63" dur="3.479">doesn&amp;#39;t always happen on Friday every</text>
  <text start="256.13" dur="3.539">year but this year it does he actually</text>
  <text start="258.109" dur="3.031">gets crucified tomorrow when the lambs</text>
  <text start="259.669" dur="3.331">are being slaughtered and then tomorrow</text>

  <text start="714.64" dur="2.97">coincided with the seven days that</text>

  <text start="750.79" dur="3.57">these things are not commanding</text>
  <text start="753.13" dur="3.03">description but they&amp;#39;re fun things to do</text>
  <text start="754.36" dur="3.78">the Passover Feast itself should be a</text>

  <text start="759.4" dur="3.36">Israel however with children present</text>
  <text start="761.23" dur="2.73">some lightness can be done such as</text>
  <text start="762.76" dur="3.33">having the children removing the last</text>
  <text start="763.96" dur="3.72">eleven and having them go on a treasure</text>
  <text start="766.09" dur="3.12">hunt to plunder the Egyptians gold</text>
  <text start="767.68" dur="4.35">wrapped chocolate coins are always a</text>
  <text start="769.21" dur="5.79">nice touch to a Passover Feast singing</text>
  <text start="772.03" dur="4.68">hymns is also encouraged during Passover</text>
