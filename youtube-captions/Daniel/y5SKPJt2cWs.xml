  <text start="56.809" dur="6.07">prayer and introspection and just</text>
  <text start="60.84" dur="8.18">pondering and meditating upon how much</text>
  <text start="62.879" dur="10.471">we as humans need atonement for our sins</text>
  <text start="69.02" dur="6.82">okay hmmm mersin tile this is an</text>
  <text start="73.35" dur="5.73">adjective and it means of or relating to</text>
  <text start="75.84" dur="7.95">merchants or trade synonyms would</text>
  <text start="79.08" dur="6.81">include money-making commercial although</text>
  <text start="83.79" dur="3.869">Satan is insane for choosing to war</text>
  <text start="85.89" dur="4.65">against his creator he is certainly not</text>
  <text start="87.659" dur="4.381">lacking in industry in fact his mersin</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="3.3">tile ways have managed to deceive</text>
  <text start="92.04" dur="4.5">billions into following this angel of</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="4.41">light remember when Yahshua consumed</text>

  <text start="98.25" dur="4.2">out the merchants in the temple with a</text>

  <text start="102.45" dur="5.129">that yah had intended for worship into</text>
  <text start="104.729" dur="4.471">amerson tiles ooh Yahshua cleansed this</text>
  <text start="107.579" dur="4.591">abomination by whipping the merchants</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="4.8">out in fact if you look at all the major</text>
  <text start="112.17" dur="4.379">wicked empires throughout or six</text>
  <text start="114" dur="5.369">thousand year history Nimrods Empire or</text>
  <text start="116.549" dur="5.67">Sumeria Egypt Assyria Babylon Persia</text>

  <text start="122.219" dur="3.9">British Kingdom the United States and</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="3.87">red China they have all gained their</text>
  <text start="126.119" dur="3.661">wealth through the versatile ways buying</text>
  <text start="128.099" dur="4.231">and selling the beautiful substances of</text>
  <text start="129.78" dur="3.75">the earth while being mersin tile in and</text>
  <text start="132.33" dur="3.36">of itself is not wrong</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="3.75">Satan has used this industry to draw</text>
  <text start="135.69" dur="4.05">wealth under nations and cause them to</text>
  <text start="137.28" dur="5.34">glory in their riches rather than their</text>
  <text start="139.74" dur="5.04">creator and each Empire with the</text>
  <text start="142.62" dur="4.98">exception of the USA in Red China has</text>
  <text start="144.78" dur="5.31">fallen due to her pride history charts</text>
  <text start="147.6" dur="4.65">empire after empire crushing crashing</text>
  <text start="150.09" dur="3.869">into the dust despite how bloated they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="152.25" dur="4.92">become through their mersin tile ways</text>
  <text start="153.959" dur="4.971">and why because righteousness exalted</text>
  <text start="157.17" dur="4.08">the nation but pride will bring it down</text>
  <text start="158.93" dur="4.18">riches and industry does not sustain a</text>
  <text start="161.25" dur="5.04">nation only adherence to the eternal</text>
  <text start="163.11" dur="5.099">Torah does before Satan managed to</text>
  <text start="166.29" dur="3.54">transform the USA into its present</text>
  <text start="168.209" dur="4.021">wicked condition through its gains of</text>
  <text start="169.83" dur="4.89">riches and pride there in the USA was</text>
  <text start="172.23" dur="5.85">observing a great deal of Torah for</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="4.98">example in the early 1600s when the</text>
  <text start="178.08" dur="3.659">Puritans first settled here in the</text>
  <text start="179.7" dur="5.31">United States Christmas was actually</text>
  <text start="181.739" dur="4.651">outlawed in fact this was a common</text>
  <text start="185.01" dur="3.87">practice even up through the</text>
  <text start="186.39" dur="4.319">Revolutionary War in fact General George</text>
  <text start="188.88" dur="4.26">Washington was able to win a decisive</text>
  <text start="190.709" dur="4.321">victory against the British because they</text>
  <text start="193.14" dur="4.5">attacked on Christmas Eve while the</text>
  <text start="195.03" dur="4.35">British were enjoying our orgy fest the</text>
  <text start="197.64" dur="3.27">early Americans knew the paganism of</text>
  <text start="199.38" dur="4.05">Christmas and it was even illegal to own</text>
  <text start="200.91" dur="4.169">a Christmas tree the Puritans and</text>
  <text start="203.43" dur="3.51">pilgrims honored many of the laws and</text>
  <text start="205.079" dur="4.141">Torah although they never came into the</text>
  <text start="206.94" dur="4.29">fullness of it however they rejected</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="4.29">much paganism and strictly abided by the</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="4.47">light that they had this righteousness</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="3.99">exalted the early colonies and slowly</text>
  <text start="215.7" dur="5.129">transformed the USA into the most</text>
  <text start="217.5" dur="5.04">powerful nation ever Satan however used</text>
  <text start="220.829" dur="3.72">the blessings of yah and her versatile</text>
  <text start="222.54" dur="4.38">ways to cause this nation to grow fat</text>
  <text start="224.549" dur="5.19">and lazy even as he managed to do to</text>
  <text start="226.92" dur="4.68">ancient Israel eventually Satan will be</text>
  <text start="229.739" dur="3.541">bound in prison and the Mersenne tile</text>
  <text start="231.6" dur="4.139">ways will no longer be used to deceive</text>
  <text start="233.28" dur="4.019">the nation&amp;#39;s it is foretold in the Book</text>
  <text start="235.739" dur="3.09">of Isaiah and elsewhere that all the</text>
  <text start="237.299" dur="3.991">Mersenne tile industry will be</text>
  <text start="238.829" dur="4.261">eventually directed toward Israel and</text>
  <text start="241.29" dur="4.83">Messiah will benefit from all the gold</text>
  <text start="243.09" dur="5.369">silver and riches of the earth unlike</text>
  <text start="246.12" dur="4.05">all the Empire&amp;#39;s before it Israel will</text>
  <text start="248.459" dur="3.84">grow rich and fat from its mersin tie</text>
  <text start="250.17" dur="4.349">ways but will not glory in her riches</text>
  <text start="252.299" dur="4.771">but rather in the Messiah ruling</text>
  <text start="254.519" dur="4.351">physically over her the scattered tribes</text>
  <text start="257.07" dur="3.93">of the earth may look on with envy and</text>
  <text start="258.87" dur="4.14">bitterness but Israel will enjoy a</text>
  <text start="261" dur="4.71">prosperous and physically wealthy time</text>
  <text start="263.01" dur="3.22">of a thousand years yet never taking her</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="4.39">eyes off</text>
  <text start="266.23" dur="6.45">for master joshua okay so why this trek</text>
  <text start="270.1" dur="4.89">through history well in our personal</text>
  <text start="272.68" dur="4.62">lives satan can trick us in the same way</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="3.96">yes we may be wholly devoted to yah</text>
  <text start="277.3" dur="3.45">wholly surrendered to the ruach ha</text>
  <text start="278.95" dur="3.87">kodesh carefully following the</text>
  <text start="280.75" dur="4.02">commandments of yah but what happens</text>
  <text start="282.82" dur="4.71">once our fidelity Diab begins to bless</text>
  <text start="284.77" dur="4.68">us with material wealth llame allow</text>
  <text start="287.53" dur="5.46">Satan to tempt us bringing Mersin top</text>
  <text start="289.45" dur="5.22">prosperity into our lives what happens</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="4.5">when we are exalted and receive a great</text>
  <text start="294.67" dur="4.53">deal of physical wealth sadly many</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="3.45">believers begin to slowly but surely</text>
  <text start="299.2" dur="3.72">trust more on their riches than in their</text>
  <text start="300.94" dur="3.6">Creator the hearts grow cold and they</text>
  <text start="302.92" dur="4.11">worship their blessings more than the</text>
  <text start="304.54" dur="4.32">blesser Satan manages like he does</text>
  <text start="307.03" dur="4.05">donations to increase his mercy on top</text>
  <text start="308.86" dur="3.84">prosperity in your life and by doing so</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="5.01">causes you to rely more on this</text>
  <text start="312.7" dur="5.25">prosperity than yeah hence why Yahshua</text>
  <text start="316.09" dur="3.54">says it is easier for a camel to fit</text>
  <text start="317.95" dur="4.77">through the eye of a needle than for a</text>
  <text start="319.63" dur="5.37">rich man to enter the kingdom yet what</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="5.85">seems impossible for man is possible</text>
  <text start="325" dur="5.58">with yah after all did not the wealthy</text>
  <text start="328.57" dur="4.14">tax collector Zacchaeus restore four</text>
  <text start="330.58" dur="3.78">times to those he had plundered and did</text>
  <text start="332.71" dur="4.5">not he give half of his wealth to the</text>
  <text start="334.36" dur="4.35">poor Yahshua saw that this man had</text>
  <text start="337.21" dur="3.66">struck down his idol of wealth and</text>
  <text start="338.71" dur="6.15">declared salvation come to this still</text>
  <text start="340.87" dur="6.21">very wealthy individual when Satan is</text>
  <text start="344.86" dur="3.99">allowed to distract us with the merchant</text>
  <text start="347.08" dur="3.42">I&amp;#39;ll waves of the earth and when yah</text>
  <text start="348.85" dur="4.08">allows money to flow into our bank</text>
  <text start="350.5" dur="5.28">accounts we must be on guard against</text>
  <text start="352.93" dur="4.65">that wicked one Satan at that point will</text>
  <text start="355.78" dur="3.9">no longer seek to draw us into open sin</text>
  <text start="357.58" dur="3.75">but rather seek to gently and subtly</text>
  <text start="359.68" dur="4.41">shift her eyes from yacht to the riches</text>
  <text start="361.33" dur="5.46">accumulating around us Satan must be</text>
  <text start="364.09" dur="5.1">resisted and rebuked llame allow Satan</text>
  <text start="366.79" dur="5.25">to tempt us but resist the devil and he</text>
  <text start="369.19" dur="4.98">will flee from you the most important</text>
  <text start="372.04" dur="3.99">daily prayer a rich man can offer is the</text>
  <text start="374.17" dur="5.01">request to walk and grow in humility</text>
  <text start="376.03" dur="4.98">even as the Savior walked Apostle Paul</text>
  <text start="379.18" dur="4.14">said he knew how to survive in want or</text>
  <text start="381.01" dur="5.67">in abundance we must learn the same</text>
  <text start="383.32" dur="5.21">lesson Joseph and Daniel were both given</text>
  <text start="386.68" dur="4.29">much wealth and a great deal of power</text>
  <text start="388.53" dur="5.02">yet they seem to have remained loyal to</text>
  <text start="390.97" dur="4.17">yah thus it is not impossible to</text>
  <text start="393.55" dur="3.65">overcome this deception of the wicked</text>
  <text start="395.14" dur="3.84">one and remain trusting in yah</text>
  <text start="397.2" dur="2.529">acknowledgment that these riches are to</text>
  <text start="398.98" dur="3.269">be given to the poor</text>
  <text start="399.729" dur="4.65">for the orphans the widows the Levite</text>
  <text start="402.249" dur="4.47">without an inheritance and planted in</text>
  <text start="404.379" dur="4.32">the kingdom of yah will go a long way in</text>
  <text start="406.719" dur="4.26">discouraging Satan and keeping your</text>
  <text start="408.699" dur="5.25">heart reliant on the Creator rather than</text>
  <text start="410.979" dur="5.19">growing riches do not try to hold your</text>
  <text start="413.949" dur="5.071">wealth or protect it it is merely Mammon</text>
  <text start="416.169" dur="4.65">and will someday pass away use money for</text>
  <text start="419.02" dur="4.289">the purpose it was intended to further</text>
  <text start="420.819" dur="4.5">the kingdom of yah on earth if this is</text>
  <text start="423.309" dur="4.67">done Satan will gnashes teeth as y&amp;#39;all</text>
  <text start="425.319" dur="4.47">continues to bless and to exalt you I</text>
  <text start="427.979" dur="5.92">thought that this teaching was</text>
  <text start="429.789" dur="6.63">particularly timely because we&amp;#39;re now</text>
  <text start="433.899" dur="3.86">approaching Yom Kippur and then five</text>
  <text start="436.419" dur="3.75">days after that the Feast of Tabernacles</text>
  <text start="437.759" dur="5.111">this is typically the time of year in</text>
  <text start="440.169" dur="4.351">which there is an in gathering so in</text>
  <text start="442.87" dur="3.539">ancient agricultural Israel this would</text>
  <text start="444.52" dur="3.419">be the year in which the fruit harvest</text>
  <text start="446.409" dur="3.961">is in gathered and there&amp;#39;s a great deal</text>
  <text start="447.939" dur="4.021">of produce to enjoy and feast upon</text>
  <text start="450.37" dur="3.99">during the eight-day Feast of</text>
  <text start="451.96" dur="4.079">Tabernacles but also this is the time of</text>
  <text start="454.36" dur="5.579">year in the fall when if we have been</text>
  <text start="456.039" dur="5.55">diligent to sew and to obey yah to trust</text>
  <text start="459.939" dur="4.35">him and to keep his precepts that</text>
  <text start="461.589" dur="5.25">typically we are also blessed physically</text>
  <text start="464.289" dur="5.011">and are able to keep this joyous time of</text>
  <text start="466.839" dur="5.31">the year Tabernacles after all an</text>
  <text start="469.3" dur="4.649">eight-day feast would modeled after a</text>
  <text start="472.149" dur="4.8">wedding feast is to be one of the most</text>
  <text start="473.949" dur="6.601">joyous and enjoyable feasts of the</text>
