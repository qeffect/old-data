  <text start="44.46" dur="4.68">really needs to be a paradigm shift a</text>
  <text start="45.899" dur="7.59">complete wholesale paradigm shift on how</text>
  <text start="49.14" dur="5.61">mainstream Christianity is viewed Satan</text>
  <text start="53.489" dur="4.111">could not have invented a better</text>

  <text start="57.6" dur="5.4">we know as mainstream Christianity</text>
  <text start="60.469" dur="4.211">Christianity and casting down the</text>

  <text start="64.68" dur="4.71">denying the obligation to obey the tour</text>
  <text start="66.9" dur="4.02">of Mo che detrimentally affects a</text>
  <text start="69.39" dur="5.28">Christian in ways that even the raw</text>

  <text start="74.67" dur="4.46">would flow through a Christian if he</text>
  <text start="77.07" dur="4.86">actually submitted to the Torah of Moshe</text>
  <text start="79.13" dur="5.79">it would be like a key fitting through a</text>
  <text start="81.93" dur="5.25">lock and opening a door to untold power</text>
  <text start="84.92" dur="4.03">well conviction of sin he would bring</text>
  <text start="87.18" dur="4.02">upon sinners and hypocrites if he walked</text>
  <text start="88.95" dur="4.02">in the commandments of yah Satan knows</text>
  <text start="91.2" dur="4.8">this and thus has erected his roadblock</text>
  <text start="92.97" dur="5.73">a Christian is often laughed at by the</text>

  <text start="103.68" dur="4.95">wonder why the Christian a subset of so</text>

  <text start="111.18" dur="5.189">which is just as forbidden in the Book</text>
  <text start="113.729" dur="4.471">of Leviticus the pious Christian might</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="4.171">then explain the seeming hypocrisy with</text>
  <text start="118.2" dur="4.98">an explanation about the moral civil and</text>

  <text start="130.539" dur="6.991">a few years ago my attention was brought</text>
  <text start="134.98" dur="4.8">to a raw gothic sinner who posed a</text>
  <text start="137.53" dur="3.81">question on a public internet forum why</text>
  <text start="139.78" dur="3.72">do Christians not obey the Old Testament</text>
  <text start="141.34" dur="5.64">law when Jesus came to better explain</text>
  <text start="143.5" dur="6.18">that law I then made sure that he was</text>
  <text start="146.98" dur="4.41">referred to our website indeed even the</text>
  <text start="149.68" dur="3.57">heathen and Cynder blinded by their own</text>

  <text start="155.65" dur="4.86">truly desires to follow the Bible in</text>
  <text start="157.48" dur="4.979">Jesus they better do so and not seek to</text>
  <text start="160.51" dur="4.649">explain away whole portions of the text</text>
  <text start="162.459" dur="4.56">a Christian will use his theology to</text>
  <text start="165.159" dur="4.321">state why he is free to break the law</text>
  <text start="167.019" dur="3.81">why he can now eat pork and doesn&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="169.48" dur="2.789">the blue fringes and can break the</text>
  <text start="170.829" dur="3.81">sabbath day or choose which day he wants</text>
  <text start="172.269" dur="4.59">to be a Sabbath or celebrate Christmas</text>
  <text start="174.639" dur="5.28">while ignoring the feast days why he is</text>

  <text start="200.169" dur="4.16">they can clearly see that Christian has</text>
  <text start="201.819" dur="5.941">little regard for the holy laws himself</text>

  <text start="246.01" dur="3.99">early 2003 yet I have left such a mark</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="5.729">that students claim I had been preaching</text>

  <text start="264.27" dur="2.46">teachers Torah will be far more</text>
  <text start="265.38" dur="4.05">effective than the Christian who does</text>
  <text start="266.73" dur="5.76">not this is simply fact it is logic it</text>
  <text start="269.43" dur="4.86">cannot be denied those who refuse to</text>

  <text start="292.38" dur="3.42">is time for the Torah to be made</text>
  <text start="293.76" dur="5.04">honourable across this nation and the</text>
  <text start="295.8" dur="4.8">world I will devote all that I am to</text>
  <text start="298.8" dur="4.29">preaching teaching and exalting the tour</text>
  <text start="300.6" dur="6.78">of Mo che I know y&amp;#39;all will continue to</text>

  <text start="309.39" dur="4.83">foundations by preaching at UCLA a</text>
  <text start="311.22" dur="7.37">number of times and it is my sincere</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="6.96">desire that hopefully I will be able to</text>
  <text start="318.59" dur="5.889">enter into the full-time ministry doing</text>
  <text start="321.18" dur="6.63">this full time hoping that one of my</text>
  <text start="324.479" dur="5.281">books catches on and I&amp;#39;m a little be a</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="4.14">full-time author and writer which is my</text>
  <text start="329.76" dur="5.67">dream and devote much more time to the</text>
  <text start="331.95" dur="6.12">ministry but the point is is that I am</text>
  <text start="335.43" dur="4.71">dedicated to making sure that I throw up</text>
  <text start="338.07" dur="5.64">any messages of mainstream Christianity</text>
  <text start="340.14" dur="5.339">that might have clung to my life and and</text>
  <text start="343.71" dur="3.63">to keep the Torah completely and totally</text>
  <text start="345.479" dur="5.761">and that is the commitment that I</text>
  <text start="347.34" dur="4.98">challenge you listener to make whether</text>
  <text start="351.24" dur="4.29">you were raised in mainstream</text>
  <text start="352.32" dur="6.21">Christianity or not it is time to to</text>
  <text start="355.53" dur="6">throw away those trappings and to return</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="6.389">to the purity of Holy Writ to return to</text>
  <text start="361.53" dur="5.79">the purity of the Torah because these</text>
  <text start="364.919" dur="4.831">commandments are not burdensome they</text>
  <text start="367.32" dur="3.57">were not just for the Jew they were not</text>
  <text start="369.75" dur="3.12">just for the Old Testament these</text>
  <text start="370.89" dur="4.05">Commandments are power they are power</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="4.68">they breathe power into your life that</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="5.07">connects you to Yahweh the Creator and</text>
  <text start="377.55" dur="4.29">there is no way that we can walk in our</text>

  <text start="385.83" dur="6.24">last days if we are not obeying the</text>
  <text start="389.16" dur="4.35">commandments it simply boils down to</text>
  <text start="392.07" dur="2.26">that we have to be obeying the</text>
  <text start="393.51" dur="2.559">commandments</text>
  <text start="394.33" dur="3.869">and I know a lot of Christians like to</text>
