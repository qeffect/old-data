  <text start="55.23" dur="4.2">condemned what Trump has done they</text>

  <text start="84.6" dur="3.96">know the Islamic world is not known for</text>
  <text start="86.7" dur="3.51">unifying on much of anything there</text>
  <text start="88.56" dur="2.849">they&amp;#39;re usually pretty at odds with each</text>
  <text start="90.21" dur="3.769">other because of all their different</text>
  <text start="91.409" dur="5.161">sects within the Muslim world and</text>
  <text start="93.979" dur="4.21">because of what Trump has done with</text>
  <text start="96.57" dur="3.81">recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="3.901">Israel it&amp;#39;s sort of United all these</text>
  <text start="100.38" dur="4.199">different Muslim and Arab countries</text>
  <text start="102.09" dur="4.29">together in the United Front I mean</text>
  <text start="104.579" dur="3.231">Saudi Arabia and Iran are historic</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="3.57">enemies and yet they both agree that</text>
  <text start="107.81" dur="4.599">they don&amp;#39;t like what&amp;#39;s happened with</text>
  <text start="109.95" dur="4.349">with Trump&amp;#39;s announcement so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="112.409" dur="4.441">historical event it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an amazing</text>
  <text start="114.299" dur="4.741">event it had to happen because Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="116.85" dur="4.199">of course will be the capital of Israel</text>
  <text start="119.04" dur="4.2">when Joshua returns to rule and reign</text>
  <text start="121.049" dur="4.741">for a thousand years as prophecies</text>
  <text start="123.24" dur="3.78">predict but what&amp;#39;s really really</text>
  <text start="125.79" dur="3.57">fascinating I think about this whole</text>
  <text start="127.02" dur="4.53">thing is that Trump made this decision</text>
  <text start="129.36" dur="3.24">this historic decision that really</text>
  <text start="131.55" dur="2.43">caught off I think a lot</text>
  <text start="132.6" dur="3.06">people off-guard but he made this</text>
  <text start="133.98" dur="3.12">decision to announce that Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="135.66" dur="3.39">would be the capital of Israel as</text>
  <text start="137.1" dur="3.57">recognized by the United States and that</text>
  <text start="139.05" dur="4.28">he would make preparations to move the</text>
  <text start="140.67" dur="5.13">embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="143.33" dur="4.36">exactly seven days before Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="145.8" dur="3.57">begins he made it on the 18th day in the</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="3.9">90 per month and count seven days you</text>
  <text start="149.37" dur="3.93">come to the twenty-fifth day so exactly</text>
  <text start="151.59" dur="3.42">seven days so we have a almost another</text>
  <text start="153.3" dur="3.6">seven day warning just as we had the</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="3.21">three earthquakes that was the seven day</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="2.97">warning before the new moon and of</text>
  <text start="158.22" dur="5.19">course the day after the new moon trump</text>
  <text start="159.87" dur="5.52">was made that historic declaration that</text>
  <text start="163.41" dur="4.62">he was adding North Korea back onto the</text>
  <text start="165.39" dur="5.4">state-sponsored terrorist list and now</text>
  <text start="168.03" dur="5.01">seven days before Hanukkah he has made</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="4.83">this historic decision to recognize</text>
  <text start="173.04" dur="5.46">Jerusalem as the capital of Israel so</text>

  <text start="188.49" dur="2.61">before and of course you know we know</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="3.78">that there&amp;#39;s a seven-day warning when</text>
  <text start="191.1" dur="4.47">Noah gets in the the Ark so whenever</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="5.4">something major occurs seven days before</text>
