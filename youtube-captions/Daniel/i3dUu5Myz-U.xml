  <text start="0.03" dur="4.2">Shalom this is Daniel John Lee with</text>
  <text start="2.01" dur="5.61">Torah restoration ministries here in</text>
  <text start="4.23" dur="6.9">Alaska it is April 20th Friday April</text>
  <text start="7.62" dur="5.55">20th 2018 tonight of course starts the</text>
  <text start="11.13" dur="4.379">weekly Shabbat the weekly Sabbath day</text>
  <text start="13.17" dur="4.32">this will actually be the first the very</text>
  <text start="15.509" dur="3.991">first Sabbath of the new year</text>
  <text start="17.49" dur="5.52">the Hebrew New Year began just a few</text>
  <text start="19.5" dur="6.21">days ago or now on a v4 and the fifth</text>
  <text start="23.01" dur="4.83">day of the month of e5 begins tonight so</text>
  <text start="25.71" dur="4.469">the Jubilee year has just ended and we</text>
  <text start="27.84" dur="4.68">are now on year one of a brand-new 50</text>
  <text start="30.179" dur="5.071">year cycle but tonight does start the</text>
  <text start="32.52" dur="4.53">first Sabbath of the Hebrew new year and</text>
  <text start="35.25" dur="3">I wanted to make since we&amp;#39;re at the very</text>
  <text start="37.05" dur="3.27">beginning of the year I thought it</text>
  <text start="38.25" dur="4.14">appropriate to make this teaching about</text>
  <text start="40.32" dur="5.04">how the feast days throughout the year</text>
  <text start="42.39" dur="5.34">actually have a mirror image of each</text>
  <text start="45.36" dur="7.109">other a lot of you probably know and</text>
  <text start="47.73" dur="6.54">understand the basic way that the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="52.469" dur="3.721">feasts unfold of course you&amp;#39;ve got the</text>
  <text start="54.27" dur="4.589">seven major feasts that are listed in</text>
  <text start="56.19" dur="5.009">Leviticus 23 and then you got two added</text>
  <text start="58.859" dur="3.93">feasts that were added later which would</text>
  <text start="61.199" dur="4.651">be Hanukkah and Purim and I want to show</text>
  <text start="62.789" dur="5.4">how all of these feasts have sort of an</text>
  <text start="65.85" dur="3.6">opposite and mirror image of themselves</text>
  <text start="68.189" dur="2.821">throughout the year and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="69.45" dur="3.45">really neat because they they all tie to</text>
  <text start="71.01" dur="4.77">each other so I&amp;#39;m gonna try to show this</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="4.44">on the board here so when we first start</text>
  <text start="75.78" dur="6.06">the Hebrew New Year which we had just a</text>
  <text start="77.34" dur="7.29">few days ago that starts on Aviv one</text>
  <text start="81.84" dur="4.529">every year and that day varies it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="84.63" dur="2.669">always on the first new moon after the</text>
  <text start="86.369" dur="3.451">spring equinox</text>
  <text start="87.299" dur="4.801">but Aviv one always occurs either in</text>
  <text start="89.82" dur="4.02">late March or April this year of course</text>
  <text start="92.1" dur="3.6">it started on the evening of April 16th</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="3.959">and went through the day of April 17th</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="4.11">but you have a v1 which is the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="97.799" dur="5.1">New Year that kicks off the year every</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="5.269">spring and in the same way when you go</text>
  <text start="102.899" dur="6.981">to the fall you have what&amp;#39;s known as the</text>
  <text start="105.079" dur="9.641">first day of the seventh he broom month</text>
  <text start="109.88" dur="5.44">which is the Feast of Trumpets or yom</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="3.719">teruah</text>
  <text start="115.32" dur="5.25">a feast of shouting so and this of</text>
  <text start="118.439" dur="4.32">course is a very joyous day there a</text>
  <text start="120.57" dur="3.91">celebratory day which one day will be</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="3.161">fulfilled when we get</text>
  <text start="124.48" dur="3.06">that last trumpet blows and we get</text>
  <text start="125.92" dur="4.65">called up to be with Yahshua in the</text>
  <text start="127.54" dur="5.19">clouds so Aviv won this very celebratory</text>
  <text start="130.57" dur="3.78">Hebrew New Year it&amp;#39;s a very special new</text>
  <text start="132.73" dur="3.51">moon because it&amp;#39;s Rosh Hashanah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="134.35" dur="4.59">literally the head of the year has a</text>
  <text start="136.24" dur="4.17">mirror image - Feast of Trumpets which</text>
  <text start="138.94" dur="5.01">happens on on the first day of the</text>
  <text start="140.41" dur="5.73">seventh month yom teruah then ten days</text>
  <text start="143.95" dur="6.15">later after the Hebrew new year of Eve</text>
  <text start="146.14" dur="5.73">one you come to Aviv ten so the tenth</text>
  <text start="150.1" dur="3.6">day after the the Hebrew new year and</text>
  <text start="151.87" dur="4.5">this is what&amp;#39;s known in Scripture as</text>
  <text start="153.7" dur="5.52">lamb day and this is the day in which</text>
  <text start="156.37" dur="5.3">lambs were selected to prepare for</text>
  <text start="159.22" dur="5.19">Passover which would be four days later</text>
  <text start="161.67" dur="5.17">this was also the day when Yahshua the</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="4.26">Messiah came into Jerusalem and he was</text>
  <text start="166.84" dur="4.77">inspected and found that have no fault</text>
  <text start="168.67" dur="5.04">so this was lamb day Aviv 10:00 in the</text>
  <text start="171.61" dur="5.43">same way when you come to the fall in</text>
  <text start="173.71" dur="5.31">the seventh month ten days later on this</text>
  <text start="177.04" dur="5.19">tenth day of the seventh month you come</text>
  <text start="179.02" dur="6.62">to what&amp;#39;s known as Yom Kippur or the day</text>
  <text start="182.23" dur="6.33">of atonement this is a day of fasting</text>
  <text start="185.64" dur="8.05">both from food and water two very solemn</text>
  <text start="188.56" dur="7.44">day so lamb day and Yom Kippur are tied</text>
  <text start="193.69" dur="4.05">together not only in their timing but if</text>
  <text start="196" dur="4.44">you think about it sort of in their</text>
  <text start="197.74" dur="4.17">meaning because lamb Day of course is</text>
  <text start="200.44" dur="4.049">all about the lamb of the world being</text>
  <text start="201.91" dur="4.829">selected to be our our atonement and Yom</text>
  <text start="204.489" dur="3.601">Kippur is literally the day of atonement</text>
  <text start="206.739" dur="3.151">so they&amp;#39;re both you can see how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.09" dur="3.26">both tied together and have a mirror</text>
  <text start="209.89" dur="5.37">image of each other</text>
  <text start="211.35" dur="5.5">then just a few days after lamb day four</text>
  <text start="215.26" dur="4.77">days actually you have what&amp;#39;s known as</text>
  <text start="216.85" dur="5.639">Passover where you have the Seder meal</text>
  <text start="220.03" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s commanded in Exodus 12 and then</text>
  <text start="222.489" dur="4.711">that&amp;#39;s followed by seven days of</text>
  <text start="224.56" dur="5.49">unleavened bread and during these days</text>
  <text start="227.2" dur="5.64">you&amp;#39;re commanded to remove all eleven</text>
  <text start="230.05" dur="4.83">from your home from your car any bread</text>
  <text start="232.84" dur="3.51">that you eat is supposed to have no</text>
  <text start="234.88" dur="3.9">leaven in it in fact you&amp;#39;re commanded to</text>
  <text start="236.35" dur="5.07">eat unleavened bread all seven days but</text>
  <text start="238.78" dur="4.77">but the way this piece is set up is you</text>
  <text start="241.42" dur="4.23">have Passover and then seven days of</text>
  <text start="243.55" dur="4.71">unleavened bread so it&amp;#39;s a total of an</text>
  <text start="245.65" dur="5.48">eight day feast well in the same way</text>
  <text start="248.26" dur="5.96">just five days after Yom Kippur you have</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="5.43">what&amp;#39;s known as Sokoto and this happens</text>
  <text start="254.22" dur="5.61">every fall where you get into a Sukkah</text>
  <text start="256.56" dur="6.6">which is like a tent and Sukkot is</text>
  <text start="259.83" dur="5.64">technically seven days long and then it</text>
  <text start="263.16" dur="4.17">has an eighth day which is a high</text>
  <text start="265.47" dur="3.78">Sabbath which is known as the last great</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="5.85">day all right</text>
  <text start="269.25" dur="5.76">so Passover you got the Passover day</text>
  <text start="273.18" dur="4.95">then you have seven days eleven eleven</text>
  <text start="275.01" dur="5.4">bread so a total of eight days for</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="4.68">Passover week and then it&amp;#39;s a code you</text>
  <text start="280.41" dur="4.38">have seven days of Sukkot along with an</text>
  <text start="282.81" dur="5.61">eighth last great day which is a high</text>
  <text start="284.79" dur="6.36">Sabbath so that&amp;#39;s also eight days you</text>
  <text start="288.42" dur="4.5">see so here we have Passover and the</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="4.28">seven days eleven bread and the seven</text>
  <text start="292.92" dur="5.55">days of Sukkot and the last great day</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="7.06">mirroring each other so all these feasts</text>
  <text start="298.47" dur="6.78">are basically mirroring each other in a</text>
  <text start="302.49" dur="4.41">very very special way of course</text>
  <text start="305.25" dur="2.97">firstfruits is in the midst of</text>
  <text start="306.9" dur="4.53">unleavened bread this is the day that</text>
  <text start="308.22" dur="5.07">Yahshua resurrects and waves himself as</text>
  <text start="311.43" dur="4.2">the first route to the Father and Sukkot</text>
  <text start="313.29" dur="4.11">is all about Yasu coding with man when</text>
  <text start="315.63" dur="3.54">he comes down and he Tabernacles with</text>
  <text start="317.4" dur="4.86">man and he&amp;#39;s with man so they&amp;#39;re tied</text>
  <text start="319.17" dur="5.61">together as well so all of these feasts</text>
  <text start="322.26" dur="6.66">all of these days have mirror images of</text>
  <text start="324.78" dur="6.51">each other seven months later 50 days</text>
  <text start="328.92" dur="4.08">after whenever firstfruits falls within</text>
  <text start="331.29" dur="4.11">the seven days of unleavened bread fifty</text>
  <text start="333" dur="6.87">days later you have what&amp;#39;s known as</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="6.93">shadow oat or Pentecost okay and that is</text>
  <text start="339.87" dur="4.26">of course about when the Torah was given</text>
  <text start="342.33" dur="3.75">and also more importantly when the Holy</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="4.53">Spirit was poured out on the Jewish</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="4.92">apostles to allow them and enable them</text>
  <text start="348.66" dur="4.68">to walk out the Torah as Yahshua walked</text>
  <text start="351" dur="4.44">it out so you have Shadwell Pentecost</text>
  <text start="353.34" dur="4.89">about fifty days or approximately two</text>
  <text start="355.44" dur="3.96">months after Passover a little more than</text>
  <text start="358.23" dur="3.93">two months are a little less than two</text>
  <text start="359.4" dur="5.49">months at Passover when you have to coat</text>
  <text start="362.16" dur="5.61">two months after Sokoto you have an</text>
  <text start="364.89" dur="6.2">eight-day feast called Hanukkah and of</text>
  <text start="367.77" dur="3.32">course Hanukkah is all about</text>
  <text start="371.12" dur="4.57">getting victory in the face of</text>
  <text start="373.71" dur="4.2">impossible odds it&amp;#39;s all about how the</text>
  <text start="375.69" dur="4.05">maccabees a small band of rebels were</text>
  <text start="377.91" dur="4.259">able to overcome the massive Greek army</text>
  <text start="379.74" dur="5.489">and liberate Israel and cleanse the</text>
  <text start="382.169" dur="5.041">temple and drive back the most powerful</text>
  <text start="385.229" dur="2.881">army in the world of the time the most</text>
  <text start="387.21" dur="3.03">powerful empire</text>
  <text start="388.11" dur="3.779">so Chanukah which is all about</text>
  <text start="390.24" dur="4.26">rededicating your temple and</text>
  <text start="391.889" dur="4.351">rededicating yourself to Yahweh happens</text>
  <text start="394.5" dur="4.44">two months after so code just like</text>
  <text start="396.24" dur="5.399">Shavuot happens just a little less than</text>
  <text start="398.94" dur="5.49">two months after Passover so you have</text>
  <text start="401.639" dur="5.461">Pentecost or shadow tied directly to</text>
  <text start="404.43" dur="4.98">Hanukkah both in timing and in meaning</text>
  <text start="407.1" dur="3.99">because shag woad is all about</text>
  <text start="409.41" dur="3.12">consecrating yourself because the holy</text>
  <text start="411.09" dur="3.15">spirit fills you that&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="412.53" dur="3.87">concentrating yourself to him and</text>
  <text start="414.24" dur="3.48">Chanukah is all about rededicating your</text>
  <text start="416.4" dur="3.45">temple rededicating yourself</text>
  <text start="417.72" dur="4.11">consecrating yourself to him and in fact</text>
  <text start="419.85" dur="4.379">I often refer to Hanukkah as the second</text>
  <text start="421.83" dur="4.62">Pentecost or the second travel in fact I</text>
  <text start="424.229" dur="6.451">have some videos about that from I think</text>
  <text start="426.45" dur="7.95">2016 so shadow has a direct mirror image</text>
  <text start="430.68" dur="6.54">in Hanukkah and then after Hanukkah you</text>
  <text start="434.4" dur="6.329">have Purim which perm of all these</text>
  <text start="437.22" dur="5.91">feasts Purim is the only feast day that</text>
  <text start="440.729" dur="4.051">does not have a counterpart it sort of</text>
  <text start="443.13" dur="4.65">stands alone and I think the reason why</text>
  <text start="444.78" dur="5.819">Purim does stand alone is because of</text>
  <text start="447.78" dur="4.949">Jesus&amp;#39;s words Yahshua&amp;#39;s words where he</text>
  <text start="450.599" dur="4.141">said pray that your flight be not in</text>
  <text start="452.729" dur="3.181">winter or on the Sabbath because when it</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="3.359">is that&amp;#39;s when the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="455.91" dur="4.08">begins if you look at perm and study it</text>
  <text start="458.099" dur="5.161">from the book of Esther it&amp;#39;s about the</text>
  <text start="459.99" dur="5.58">Antichrist figure Haman and Esther&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.26" dur="4.56">ability to overcome Haman and save her</text>
  <text start="465.57" dur="3.81">people but when parem is eventually</text>
  <text start="467.82" dur="2.819">fulfilled prophetically it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="469.38" dur="4.14">the beginning of the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="470.639" dur="4.59">according to Joshua&amp;#39;s own words because</text>
  <text start="473.52" dur="5.79">perm is the one feast that&amp;#39;s both in the</text>
  <text start="475.229" dur="5.94">winter and can be on a Sabbath and is a</text>
  <text start="479.31" dur="3.81">Sabbath as well Paramus is considered a</text>
  <text start="481.169" dur="4.021">Sabbath those two days so I think per</text>
  <text start="483.12" dur="3.24">arm stands alone because it begins the</text>
  <text start="485.19" dur="4.44">Great Tribulation it&amp;#39;s about the</text>
  <text start="486.36" dur="4.71">Antichrist it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a time of great</text>
  <text start="489.63" dur="3.39">darkness when the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="491.07" dur="3.599">begins but also a great deliverance for</text>
  <text start="493.02" dur="3.75">for those who are in Philadelphia that</text>
  <text start="494.669" dur="5.041">get led to the safe place so I think</text>
  <text start="496.77" dur="4.26">perfor that reason it stands alone sort</text>
  <text start="499.71" dur="2.45">of stands above all these other feasts</text>
  <text start="501.03" dur="3.5">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s set</text>
  <text start="502.16" dur="4.92">does not have a counterpart because of</text>
  <text start="504.53" dur="4.98">that but all these other feast days they</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="5.1">they clearly have counterparts Aviv one</text>
  <text start="509.51" dur="5.31">is tied directly to the first day of the</text>
  <text start="512.18" dur="5.489">seventh month piece of Trumpets lamb de</text>
  <text start="514.82" dur="4.26">Aviv ten directly connected to Yom</text>
  <text start="517.669" dur="4.021">Kippur on the tenth day of the seventh</text>
  <text start="519.08" dur="4.29">month Passover plus the seven days of</text>
  <text start="521.69" dur="3.6">unleavened bread an eight day feast is</text>
  <text start="523.37" dur="3.33">directly connected to Sokoto the seven</text>
  <text start="525.29" dur="3.57">days of coat and then the eight last</text>
  <text start="526.7" dur="4.41">great day eight day feast eight day</text>
  <text start="528.86" dur="4.74">feast and then about two months later</text>
  <text start="531.11" dur="5.34">you have Shavuot Pentecost a time of</text>
  <text start="533.6" dur="4.44">consecration and rededication directly</text>
  <text start="536.45" dur="3.21">tied to Hanukkah which is about two</text>
  <text start="538.04" dur="4.41">months after so coat a time of</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="4.53">consecration and rededication so I hope</text>
  <text start="542.45" dur="3.92">this just shows how all the feast days</text>
  <text start="544.19" dur="5.7">have mirror images of each other</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="5.47">throughout the year spring and fall and</text>
  <text start="549.89" dur="4.28">then I think yot planned it this way he</text>
  <text start="551.84" dur="4.83">planned it to give each of the feasts</text>
  <text start="554.17" dur="4.87">sort of an added meaning and a gonna and</text>
  <text start="556.67" dur="5.76">how each of these days that that we see</text>
  <text start="559.04" dur="8.4">in the spring they are completed and</text>
  <text start="562.43" dur="8.07">fulfilled and and I guess it may more</text>
  <text start="567.44" dur="5.1">full more whole by their counterpart in</text>
  <text start="570.5" dur="4.05">the fall and and teaches us more about</text>
  <text start="572.54" dur="4.08">these days so of course we&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="574.55" dur="5.25">had the New Year of Eve one which was a</text>
  <text start="576.62" dur="5.34">few days ago and this next Thursday will</text>
  <text start="579.8" dur="4.08">be lamb day this year and then of course</text>
  <text start="581.96" dur="3.54">starting on April 30 if we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
