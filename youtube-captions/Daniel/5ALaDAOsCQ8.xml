  <text start="28.8" dur="4.91">maybe podcast late last night I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="32.099" dur="5.281">kind of exploring a lot of the thoughts</text>
  <text start="33.71" dur="5.5">you know that are circulating in my</text>
  <text start="37.38" dur="3.839">brain about this new year I think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="39.21" dur="4.169">very exciting new year because as I said</text>
  <text start="41.219" dur="3.891">in that video it&amp;#39;s not only a new moon</text>
  <text start="43.379" dur="4.831">it&amp;#39;s not only the first new moon of the</text>
  <text start="45.11" dur="5.14">first day of the first month but it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="48.21" dur="3.329">shim it a year and it&amp;#39;s not only Schmidt</text>
  <text start="50.25" dur="3.149">a year it&amp;#39;s a sham it up Schmidt years</text>
  <text start="51.539" dur="3.301">it&amp;#39;s the 49th year of the cycle but you</text>
  <text start="53.399" dur="3.48">can listen to that podcast for details</text>
  <text start="54.84" dur="3.809">on that I just want to make a brief it</text>
  <text start="56.879" dur="3.241">adjust to wish everyone a very happy new</text>
  <text start="58.649" dur="4.381">year I think this is going to be a very</text>
  <text start="60.12" dur="4.59">very special new year because it is a</text>
  <text start="63.03" dur="3.3">shemitah and it&amp;#39;s a shemitah of Shem it</text>
  <text start="64.71" dur="3.03">is which means it&amp;#39;s the last shipment it</text>
  <text start="66.33" dur="3.719">right before a jubilee that will begin</text>
  <text start="67.74" dur="3.989">next spring and so I really believe this</text>
  <text start="70.049" dur="4.11">is going to be a very very special year</text>
  <text start="71.729" dur="4.851">one of the reasons like the reason I</text>
  <text start="74.159" dur="5.25">like to film as many pockets as I can</text>
  <text start="76.58" dur="6.49">when I&amp;#39;m able to outside is that I</text>
  <text start="79.409" dur="5.791">really feel like the scenery of my</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="4.02">podcast helps to add to the content so</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="4.099">you know last shabbat i made a video</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="5.58">about the last sabbath of the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="89.299" dur="5.351">year and I filmed it up in the gorge and</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="4.199">I really felt like the setting of the</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="4.56">Sun and the beauty of the gorge added to</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="4.801">the richness of the content and so today</text>
  <text start="99.21" dur="4.32">I just wanted to kind of show you just</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="4.08">the beauty that we have here in Oregon</text>
  <text start="103.53" dur="4.5">because we had the rainiest season ever</text>
  <text start="105.75" dur="4.079">in Oregon this year we normally get six</text>
  <text start="108.03" dur="4.409">inches of rain in December we got 16</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="4.08">inches of rain in December and of course</text>
  <text start="112.439" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s been raining non-stop pretty much</text>
  <text start="113.909" dur="4.291">from october through april and it</text>
  <text start="116.549" dur="3.841">typically keeps on writing until June</text>
  <text start="118.2" dur="3.84">but we have a little dry period these</text>
  <text start="120.39" dur="5.46">last few days for the new year and just</text>
  <text start="122.04" dur="5.88">wanted to show just the beautiful just</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="4.29">gorgeous trees here in Oregon and of</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="4.759">course you see the pine trees you know</text>
  <text start="130.14" dur="2.539">way up there</text>
  <text start="132.89" dur="4.87">but just to give you a glimpse just how</text>
  <text start="135.54" dur="6.21">beautiful is and doesn&amp;#39;t it make so much</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="6.42">sense that the new year would be in the</text>
  <text start="141.75" dur="4.86">time of spring because a new year is a</text>
  <text start="144.18" dur="4.02">new beginning it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a new start</text>
  <text start="146.61" dur="4.68">and so it would make sense that it would</text>
  <text start="148.2" dur="4.83">start right when everything&amp;#39;s new spring</text>
  <text start="151.29" dur="4.11">when everything&amp;#39;s fresh and green and</text>
  <text start="153.03" dur="4.319">growing why would you celebrate the new</text>
  <text start="155.4" dur="3.57">year on December the 31st January first</text>
  <text start="157.349" dur="3.621">right in the middle of winter when</text>
  <text start="158.97" dur="4.65">everything&amp;#39;s dead that makes no sense</text>
  <text start="160.97" dur="4.9">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s counterfeit it&amp;#39;s a pagan</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="5.16">custom when I supposed to celebrate New</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="4.35">Years on january first that&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="4.41">middle of winter it&amp;#39;s at the time of</text>
  <text start="170.22" dur="5.01">deadness this the time of growth the</text>
  <text start="173.19" dur="3.6">time of resurrection this is the time of</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="2.729">deliverance this is when we should</text>
  <text start="176.79" dur="2.46">celebrate the new year and this is what</text>
  <text start="177.959" dur="3.75">the scripture says to do that&amp;#39;s why this</text>
  <text start="179.25" dur="4.2">this is the time of the new year now the</text>
  <text start="181.709" dur="3.601">new year doesn&amp;#39;t always fall on april</text>
  <text start="183.45" dur="4.369">eighth it falls on a different day every</text>
  <text start="185.31" dur="5.099">year sometime in march and april</text>
  <text start="187.819" dur="6.67">depending on the when the new moon falls</text>
  <text start="190.409" dur="6.33">and various other things but this year</text>
  <text start="194.489" dur="4.68">the Schmidty year begins today so i</text>
  <text start="196.739" dur="4.231">think it makes a lot of sense that</text>
  <text start="199.169" dur="3.771">yahweh would have us begin the year when</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="5.97">everything so green and beautiful</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="5.59">alright well i just got off work and I</text>
  <text start="206.94" dur="3.269">have to go prepare for Shabbat which</text>
  <text start="208.53" dur="3.629">means I got to run around like crazy and</text>
  <text start="210.209" dur="3.15">get to the grocery stores and do my</text>
  <text start="212.159" dur="3.271">errands and get everything done before</text>
  <text start="213.359" dur="3.451">the Sun sets tonight I&amp;#39;m so glad that</text>
  <text start="215.43" dur="3.119">we&amp;#39;re in April because now that least</text>
  <text start="216.81" dur="4.109">the sun doesn&amp;#39;t set until seven thirty</text>
  <text start="218.549" dur="3.93">eight o&amp;#39;clock in the evening and we have</text>
  <text start="220.919" dur="3.21">plenty of daylight after work to get</text>
  <text start="222.479" dur="3.961">things done which is much better than</text>
  <text start="224.129" dur="4.29">December when pretty much need to get</text>
