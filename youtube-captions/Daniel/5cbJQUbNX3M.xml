  <text start="268.919" dur="4.381">allow Trump to use our national security</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="3.54">for partisan purposes yet again because</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s what was in the best interest of</text>
  <text start="274.59" dur="6.18">the country guy was so stupid so the</text>
  <text start="278.97" dur="2.729">media has decided to spin the decision</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="3.03">as voluntary</text>
  <text start="281.699" dur="3.991">yeah just like former Bill Clinton</text>
