  <text start="5.759" dur="5.581">Oklahoma our next stop normally I would</text>
  <text start="9.809" dur="3.33">have never considered preaching at the</text>
  <text start="11.34" dur="3.99">University of Oklahoma because by the</text>
  <text start="13.139" dur="4.89">time we left Alabama the school year was</text>
  <text start="15.33" dur="4.98">practically over in fact the UFO was</text>
  <text start="18.029" dur="3.781">already in its finals weeks which is</text>
  <text start="20.31" dur="3.299">always a very difficult time of year to</text>
  <text start="21.81" dur="4.889">draw a crowd due to the pressure of</text>
  <text start="23.609" dur="5.041">exams on students however some friends</text>
  <text start="26.699" dur="4.23">of the Arkansas congregation we visited</text>
  <text start="28.65" dur="4.65">who also happened to attend Monta</text>
  <text start="30.929" dur="4.47">Judah&amp;#39;s messianic congregation invited</text>
  <text start="33.3" dur="3.45">us to stay with them for a week free</text>
  <text start="35.399" dur="3.801">food and lodging meant that yah</text>
  <text start="36.75" dur="5.01">definitely wanted us on that University</text>
  <text start="39.2" dur="4.99">driving up a long dusty road that led</text>
  <text start="41.76" dur="5.279">onto a small farm we admired the quiet</text>
  <text start="44.19" dur="4.65">beauty of rural Oklahoma our hosts an</text>
  <text start="47.039" dur="4.741">elderly couple in their mid seventies</text>
  <text start="48.84" dur="4.62">met us on their driveway as we made our</text>
  <text start="51.78" dur="3.63">introductions and settle down for some</text>
  <text start="53.46" dur="3.63">coffee in their modest living room the</text>
  <text start="55.41" dur="4.739">husband began to share an insight that</text>
  <text start="57.09" dur="4.89">still carries with me to this day Daniel</text>
  <text start="60.149" dur="3.931">remember how the Messiah said that as</text>
  <text start="61.98" dur="4.38">long as I remain with you the light is</text>
  <text start="64.08" dur="4.38">with you however when I depart and the</text>
  <text start="66.36" dur="5.07">darkness comes when no man can work I</text>
  <text start="68.46" dur="5.4">nodded well think of Yahshua as the Sun</text>
  <text start="71.43" dur="4.74">when he came the first time the Sun was</text>
  <text start="73.86" dur="4.59">setting the light would be all the signs</text>
  <text start="76.17" dur="4.71">and miracles he did and in the book of</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="4.739">Acts the Sun was continuing to set you</text>
  <text start="80.88" dur="5.04">still have light signs and miracles as</text>
  <text start="83.189" dur="4.5">that Sun is setting eventually the Sun</text>
  <text start="85.92" dur="4.19">is completely set and all you are left</text>
  <text start="87.689" dur="5.22">with his darkness and stars in the sky</text>
  <text start="90.11" dur="4.96">which is why for the past two thousand</text>
  <text start="92.909" dur="4.021">years you don&amp;#39;t see the huge miracles</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="3.509">that were done back then but only here</text>
  <text start="96.93" dur="4.829">and there do you see miracles just like</text>
  <text start="98.579" dur="5.201">the stars dotting a black sky I lean</text>
  <text start="101.759" dur="4.661">forward gripping my coffee cup</text>
  <text start="103.78" dur="5.76">he continued now when the Messiah</text>
  <text start="106.42" dur="5.129">returns it will be the Sun rising just</text>
  <text start="109.54" dur="4.5">before the Sun rises you see the dawn</text>
  <text start="111.549" dur="4.921">lighting up the eastern horizon again</text>
  <text start="114.04" dur="4.259">filling the sky with light this will be</text>
  <text start="116.47" dur="5.34">the mighty exploits that the Saints will</text>
  <text start="118.299" dur="6.031">be doing just before his return Wow I</text>
  <text start="121.81" dur="5.37">said sipping my coffee I&amp;#39;ve never heard</text>
  <text start="124.33" dur="4.47">of put that way before our first couple</text>
  <text start="127.18" dur="4.2">of days at the University of Oklahoma</text>
  <text start="128.8" dur="5.13">were as I expected very difficult to</text>
  <text start="131.38" dur="4.23">draw crowd one morning as we were</text>
  <text start="133.93" dur="3.54">preparing to leave for the day I noticed</text>
  <text start="135.61" dur="4.53">this huge poster on the wall of our</text>
  <text start="137.47" dur="5.12">temporary bedroom it was a massive tree</text>
  <text start="140.14" dur="5.129">that charter the Lost Tribes of Israel</text>
  <text start="142.59" dur="4.899">however as I began to study the poster</text>
  <text start="145.269" dur="4.651">more closely chill ran through my spine</text>
  <text start="147.489" dur="4.261">I noticed that it seemed to say all</text>
  <text start="149.92" dur="4.53">black people were not from the tribes</text>
  <text start="151.75" dur="4.44">and considered Gentiles I stepped back</text>
  <text start="154.45" dur="3.45">from the poster shook my head and</text>
  <text start="156.19" dur="4.62">thought maybe I was misunderstanding</text>
  <text start="157.9" dur="4.41">what was being shown however as I was</text>
  <text start="160.81" dur="3.179">helping to load the boys in her van I</text>
  <text start="162.31" dur="3.66">overheard hanukkah telling our host</text>
  <text start="163.989" dur="3.181">about a young black student who had</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="4.13">shown a great deal of interest in the</text>
  <text start="167.17" dur="5.46">Torah the wife smiled and said ah yes</text>
  <text start="170.1" dur="4.84">even those types of people can come into</text>
  <text start="172.63" dur="4.43">the faith onic and I exchanged a glance</text>
  <text start="174.94" dur="4.5">with each other as we left the house I</text>
  <text start="177.06" dur="4.81">poster in the bedroom we are staying in</text>
  <text start="179.44" dur="4.69">makes a lot more sense now Annika said</text>
  <text start="181.87" dur="4.51">as we buckled our children into the band</text>
  <text start="184.13" dur="4.44">yeah I think they believe in some sort</text>
  <text start="186.38" dur="3.66">of white British is realism we&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="188.57" dur="5.04">white people can become genuine</text>
  <text start="190.04" dur="5.07">Israelites I felt sickened it was bad</text>
  <text start="193.61" dur="3.27">enough that some Nessie anak Jewish</text>
  <text start="195.11" dur="4.2">congregations try to redirect the wall</text>
  <text start="196.88" dur="4.05">of partition between Jew and Gentile by</text>
  <text start="199.31" dur="3.39">treating them differently but this</text>
  <text start="200.93" dur="4.29">seemed to be a new racial twist on the</text>
  <text start="202.7" dur="5.13">whole concept it was definitely strange</text>
  <text start="205.22" dur="3.99">fire but we&amp;#39;d have to endure it for a</text>
  <text start="207.83" dur="4.02">few more days while we stayed with our</text>
  <text start="209.21" dur="4.5">hosts as we began driving the dusty</text>
  <text start="211.85" dur="4.17">roads out of the rule farmlands into</text>
  <text start="213.71" dur="4.5">town at began wondering why yah had</text>
  <text start="216.02" dur="4.05">brought us to this place we hadn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="218.21" dur="3.45">able to draw huge crowds our host</text>
  <text start="220.07" dur="3.39">believe some very strange and</text>
  <text start="221.66" dur="4.26">uncomfortable doctrine and this whole</text>
  <text start="223.46" dur="3.87">week seemed to be a mistake as I began</text>
  <text start="225.92" dur="3.84">to preach on our fourth day at the U of</text>
  <text start="227.33" dur="4.53">O a small crowd of very vile heckler</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="3.69">surrounded me they were mocking almost</text>
  <text start="231.86" dur="4.32">every scripture that came out of my</text>
  <text start="233.45" dur="5.13">mouth so what messianic congregation do</text>
  <text start="236.18" dur="4.86">you guys attend a loud whisper from</text>
  <text start="238.58" dur="4.56">behind me surprise me standing in the</text>
  <text start="241.04" dur="4.2">shadow of a grove of trees a young woman</text>
  <text start="243.14" dur="4.2">named Kimberly was desperate to get my</text>
  <text start="245.24" dur="4.35">attention but clearly intimidated by the</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="4.14">heckler surrounding me I stepped away</text>
  <text start="249.59" dur="4.68">from the crowd and motion for my wife to</text>
  <text start="251.48" dur="4.71">join us I&amp;#39;ve been convicted for several</text>
  <text start="254.27" dur="3.27">months about keeping Torah and I</text>
  <text start="256.19" dur="3.21">couldn&amp;#39;t find a church anywhere that</text>
  <text start="257.54" dur="4.44">actually did so she explained to us I</text>
  <text start="259.4" dur="4.23">know I shouldn&amp;#39;t eat certain foods but</text>
  <text start="261.98" dur="4.17">I&amp;#39;m confused on what is acceptable eat</text>
  <text start="263.63" dur="4.05">and what is not as she continued to</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="3.3">relate her story it became clear to</text>
  <text start="267.68" dur="4.26">Annika myself that she was extremely</text>
  <text start="269.45" dur="4.02">hungry for the truth we spent a couple</text>
  <text start="271.94" dur="3.36">of hours just talking to her one on one</text>
  <text start="273.47" dur="3.18">answering all of her questions and</text>
  <text start="275.3" dur="4.32">giving her plenty of traps to think</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="5.46">about after she left I embraced my wife</text>
  <text start="279.62" dur="5.31">with joy this whole week has been worked</text>
  <text start="282.11" dur="4.41">at just to meet Kimberly to celebrate we</text>
  <text start="284.93" dur="2.43">left that afternoon to eat at a local</text>
  <text start="286.52" dur="3.28">sandwich</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="5.83">his clouds don&amp;#39;t look friendly at all</text>
  <text start="289.8" dur="5.61">Annika said dark yellow and brown slaps</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="4.5">covered the sky and all the wind had</text>
  <text start="295.41" dur="4.11">died as we ate the lights went out</text>
  <text start="297.69" dur="4.14">briefly just a few flickers of darkness</text>
  <text start="299.52" dur="3.99">then everything returned to normal we</text>
  <text start="301.83" dur="3.24">were too busy talking about Kimberly and</text>
  <text start="303.51" dur="3.72">the wonderful day we had on campus to</text>
  <text start="305.07" dur="4.11">notice anything else but the next</text>
  <text start="307.23" dur="4.26">morning we discovered on the news that a</text>
  <text start="309.18" dur="4.95">huge tornado had ripped through Oklahoma</text>
  <text start="311.49" dur="4.05">City in fact it had passed so close to</text>
  <text start="314.13" dur="3.99">the campus that the students have been</text>
  <text start="315.54" dur="4.41">evacuated early as we drove back into</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="3.57">town the next day surveying the damage</text>
  <text start="319.95" dur="3.92">that tornado had brought on various</text>
  <text start="321.69" dur="4.62">businesses he were joyfully grateful</text>
  <text start="323.87" dur="5.5">Yahweh had kept us completely safe to</text>
  <text start="326.31" dur="4.89">the entire experience in fact it kept us</text>
  <text start="329.37" dur="4.05">so saved that we weren&amp;#39;t even aware what</text>
  <text start="331.2" dur="3.51">had happened until the next day I will</text>
  <text start="333.42" dur="3.12">always remember that incident is a</text>
  <text start="334.71" dur="4.8">testimony to how yah protects his people</text>
  <text start="336.54" dur="4.68">when they are doing his will being in</text>
  <text start="339.51" dur="4.26">the center of his will means he will</text>
  <text start="341.22" dur="5.22">shield his own even in the midst of the</text>
  <text start="343.77" dur="5.34">storm on one of our last days in</text>
  <text start="346.44" dur="5.1">Oklahoma monta Judah had invited onic</text>

  <text start="353.22" dur="3.069">onto the plush carpet of Monty&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="354.69" dur="2.77">ministry headquarters</text>

  <text start="368.86" dur="4.5">walls Monta greeted us he had a large</text>
  <text start="371.559" dur="3.36">beard that tumbled down his chest and</text>
  <text start="373.36" dur="4.049">spectacles on his nose that reflected</text>
  <text start="374.919" dur="5.64">the light his voice a deep baritone is</text>

  <text start="437.98" dur="3.3">on and on about how this mission would</text>
  <text start="439.45" dur="3.75">not work it became clear that he wanted</text>
  <text start="441.28" dur="3.99">us to settle down in Oklahoma joining</text>
  <text start="443.2" dur="4.38">his congregation rather than doing what</text>
  <text start="445.27" dur="4.8">God called us to do this was not what we</text>
  <text start="447.58" dur="4.23">needed here look we should probably be</text>

  <text start="469.45" dur="4.38">their car seats I know what you mean</text>
  <text start="471.54" dur="4.63">something very dark it weren&amp;#39;t its way</text>
  <text start="473.83" dur="4.05">to my heart perhaps it had started over</text>
  <text start="476.17" dur="3.84">the past few weeks as I called mark back</text>
  <text start="477.88" dur="3.45">at PSU and realized despite the</text>
  <text start="480.01" dur="3.45">newsletters we were sending out to</text>
  <text start="481.33" dur="5.01">almost a hundred people but not a single</text>

  <text start="486.34" dur="4.02">Montes talk i put a very despairing</text>
  <text start="488.14" dur="4.53">thought into my mind maybe we weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="490.36" dur="5.19">doing with the odd calls to do after all</text>
  <text start="492.67" dur="4.56">as we headed north we had planned to</text>
  <text start="495.55" dur="4.17">stop at colorado state university in</text>
  <text start="497.23" dur="4.44">fort collins colorado i had preached on</text>
  <text start="499.72" dur="3.9">this campus a few years ago before i</text>
  <text start="501.67" dur="3.73">became a messianic and knew this was</text>
  <text start="503.62" dur="4.49">always a great place to gather a crowd</text>
  <text start="505.4" dur="4.93">however when we arrived at CSU a</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="3.66">combination of whether finals weeks and</text>
  <text start="510.33" dur="3.45">the growing doubt my heart cut our</text>
  <text start="511.77" dur="4.05">mission short the second day we</text>
  <text start="513.78" dur="3.569">appreciate CSU I had all my tracks</text>
  <text start="515.82" dur="3.57">printed and set up in seven different</text>
  <text start="517.349" dur="4.411">stacks in front of me as was my custom</text>
  <text start="519.39" dur="5.25">but a violent gust of wind wound up</text>
  <text start="521.76" dur="4.29">fleeting my tracks all across campus had</text>
  <text start="524.64" dur="3.18">to spend a few hours just trying to</text>
  <text start="526.05" dur="3.53">collect all the paper so the campus</text>
  <text start="527.82" dur="3.84">wouldn&amp;#39;t find me for trashing the quad</text>
  <text start="529.58" dur="4.27">although we had some good one-on-ones</text>
  <text start="531.66" dur="4.53">with various students on anxiety began</text>
  <text start="533.85" dur="5.13">growing in my heart any donations and</text>
  <text start="536.19" dur="4.74">all yet I asked mark over the phone no</text>
  <text start="538.98" dur="4.26">nothing although i have sent out a third</text>
  <text start="540.93" dur="3.87">newsletter as i shut up the phone i</text>
  <text start="543.24" dur="3.39">realized that the five hundred dollars</text>
  <text start="544.8" dur="2.86">Monty given us was pretty much all we</text>
  <text start="546.63" dur="3.22">have to live on</text>
  <text start="547.66" dur="4.13">other than credit cards our savings were</text>
