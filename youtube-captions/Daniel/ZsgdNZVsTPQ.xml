  <text start="0.03" dur="10.279">halleluyah halleluyah the seventh day a</text>
  <text start="6.259" dur="7.42">UCLA number seven is the perfect number</text>
  <text start="10.309" dur="5.231">tied to Sabbath but this was the seventh</text>
  <text start="13.679" dur="7.19">day since November 19th that I was out</text>
  <text start="15.54" dur="9.21">here and Sam got a real full healing</text>
  <text start="20.869" dur="7.121">spiritually some of you don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="24.75" dur="6.39">but when someone who proclaims to love</text>
  <text start="27.99" dur="5.069">Christ is not walking in holiness as Sam</text>
  <text start="31.14" dur="3.66">confessed to me last week and even</text>
  <text start="33.059" dur="6.391">started defending his sin after I prayed</text>
  <text start="34.8" dur="6.689">for him once someone who proclaims to be</text>
  <text start="39.45" dur="4.14">a lover of Messiah actually totally</text>
  <text start="41.489" dur="4.32">gives himself to the Messiah and starts</text>
  <text start="43.59" dur="3.87">living holy in other word is fully</text>
  <text start="45.809" dur="4.23">filled with the spirit covered in the</text>
  <text start="47.46" dur="4.86">blood and can say like David said in</text>
  <text start="50.039" dur="5.821">psalm 119 I will keep your Commandments</text>
  <text start="52.32" dur="6.419">I will not forsake your word and that is</text>
  <text start="55.86" dur="4.41">what Sam said to me today rather than</text>
  <text start="58.739" dur="4.5">defending us in like you did last week</text>
  <text start="60.27" dur="4.679">now under the power of the Spirit he</text>
  <text start="63.239" dur="3.81">said yes Daniel thank you for praying</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="6.35">for me and I have forsaken that sin and</text>
  <text start="67.049" dur="6.18">I will love Jesus with everything in me</text>
  <text start="71.299" dur="4.661">maybe he&amp;#39;ll get healed from that</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="6.721">wheelchair maybe not but to me this was</text>
  <text start="75.96" dur="5.82">a far greater victory because now with</text>
  <text start="79.95" dur="4.23">him being totally sold out for Messiah</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="3.9">and with the influence that he has here</text>
  <text start="84.18" dur="3.479">at UCLA he&amp;#39;s been here for three years</text>
  <text start="85.68" dur="3.81">he&amp;#39;s now a senior in his fourth year and</text>
  <text start="87.659" dur="5.1">he&amp;#39;s connected to a lot of different</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="6.3">Christian groups who have quite frankly</text>
  <text start="92.759" dur="4.591">been layered I seen and lukewarm I can</text>
  <text start="95.79" dur="6.689">tell you right now Sam&amp;#39;s no longer</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="7.769">lukewarm that&amp;#39;s the healing we need it&amp;#39;s</text>
