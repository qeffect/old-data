  <text start="0.38" dur="4.39">Shalom this is Daniel John Lee with tor</text>
  <text start="2.82" dur="5.16">restoration ministries this is a message</text>
  <text start="4.77" dur="5.1">Joss put on my heart called win to</text>
  <text start="7.98" dur="4.409">rebuke someone in public or when is it</text>
  <text start="9.87" dur="5.099">appropriate scripturally to rebuke a</text>
  <text start="12.389" dur="4.381">brother or sister in yacht in public</text>
  <text start="14.969" dur="3.57">before everyone and when is it</text>
  <text start="16.77" dur="3.99">appropriate to rebuke them privately</text>
  <text start="18.539" dur="4.41">just between you and the other person</text>
  <text start="20.76" dur="2.849">and I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of confusion</text>
  <text start="22.949" dur="2.401">right now</text>
  <text start="23.609" dur="3.571">in the body of Messiah whether we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="25.35" dur="4.019">talking about messianic Hebrew roots or</text>
  <text start="27.18" dur="4.829">Christians or whatever there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="29.369" dur="6.091">confusion as to when rebuking should be</text>
  <text start="32.009" dur="5.73">done so a lot of people will quote</text>
  <text start="35.46" dur="3.99">Matthew 18 where Yahshua very</text>
  <text start="37.739" dur="4.561">specifically says that if your brother</text>
  <text start="39.45" dur="4.5">or sister shall trespass against you go</text>
  <text start="42.3" dur="4.86">and tell him his or her fault between</text>
  <text start="43.95" dur="5.129">thee and him or her alone and if she and</text>
  <text start="47.16" dur="3.51">if he or she shall hear thee you have</text>
  <text start="49.079" dur="4.8">gained your brother or your sister and</text>
  <text start="50.67" dur="4.529">there&amp;#39;s these stages right you go to</text>
  <text start="53.879" dur="3.09">them first and if they don&amp;#39;t repent you</text>
  <text start="55.199" dur="3.241">bring you know a couple of other</text>
  <text start="56.969" dur="2.761">witnesses and if they still don&amp;#39;t repent</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="2.549">then you bring him before the assembly</text>
  <text start="59.73" dur="3.629">and if they still don&amp;#39;t repent they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="60.989" dur="4.56">considered even but I want you to notice</text>
  <text start="63.359" dur="4.951">something very special about Matthew 18</text>
  <text start="65.549" dur="5.881">Yahshua uses his words very carefully</text>
  <text start="68.31" dur="6.51">and he says if your brother or sister</text>
  <text start="71.43" dur="5.22">shall trespass against you so if someone</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="3.45">trespasses against you personally</text>
  <text start="76.65" dur="3.68">than yes you&amp;#39;re supposed to go to them</text>
  <text start="78.27" dur="5.58">privately first that&amp;#39;s the first stage</text>
  <text start="80.33" dur="6.07">however what if that brother or sister</text>
  <text start="83.85" dur="4.53">does not trespass against you but</text>
  <text start="86.4" dur="4.5">commits a trespass in front of everyone</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="5.27">well there&amp;#39;s actually a situation where</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="8.13">we can go to that addresses that in</text>
  <text start="93.65" dur="8.95">first Timothy did you do chapter 5 verse</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="7.26">20 it says then that sin rebuke before</text>
  <text start="102.6" dur="5.4">all that others also may fear now</text>
  <text start="106.29" dur="6.03">there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a proverb actually</text>
  <text start="108" dur="6.21">that says you know open rebuke is better</text>
  <text start="112.32" dur="4.35">than secret love which is kind of where</text>
  <text start="114.21" dur="4.979">Paul gets this principle but basically</text>
  <text start="116.67" dur="5.879">if a brother or sister in the Lord in</text>
  <text start="119.189" dur="5.131">Yahweh sins publicly you are to rebuke</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="4.051">them publicly that others may fear and</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="4.439">we see this happening in Scripture for</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="4.379">instance when Peter sinned publicly by</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="3.731">going along with the Pharisees and not</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="3.011">eating with the the new</text>
  <text start="132.49" dur="4.89">converted Gentiles who are trying to be</text>
  <text start="133.99" dur="5.85">grafted into Israel Paul did not take</text>
  <text start="137.38" dur="3.57">Peter aside privately Paul rebuked Peter</text>
  <text start="139.84" dur="2.94">right to his face</text>
  <text start="140.95" dur="3.54">and basically embarrassed him before</text>
  <text start="142.78" dur="5.1">everyone and Peter was humble enough to</text>
  <text start="144.49" dur="5.16">repent so there&amp;#39;s a purpose to rebuking</text>
  <text start="147.88" dur="3.93">a brother or sister in public and that</text>
  <text start="149.65" dur="3.54">is if they don&amp;#39;t trespass against you</text>
  <text start="151.81" dur="4.11">but they&amp;#39;re trespassing against yan</text>
  <text start="153.19" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re doing it in public then first</text>
  <text start="155.92" dur="4.26">Timothy 5:20 is appropriate and in fact</text>
  <text start="158.68" dur="2.91">there&amp;#39;s another scripture that goes</text>
  <text start="160.18" dur="3.27">right along with this and it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="161.59" dur="5.07">Ephesians 5:11 which I&amp;#39;m sure most of</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="4.5">you know where it says have no</text>
  <text start="166.66" dur="3.93">fellowship with the works of darkness</text>
  <text start="167.95" dur="4.41">but rather reprove them now that can be</text>
  <text start="170.59" dur="3.39">done privately or publicly but if</text>
  <text start="172.36" dur="3.72">someone is doing something in public</text>
  <text start="173.98" dur="3.93">especially in a gathering of believers</text>
  <text start="176.08" dur="3.36">and they send publicly you are -</text>
  <text start="177.91" dur="4.17">definitely rebuke them publicly and</text>
  <text start="179.44" dur="5.91">that&amp;#39;s clearly established in first</text>
  <text start="182.08" dur="5.97">Timothy 5:20 and if your regulations one</text>
  <text start="185.35" dur="5.61">in chapter 2 chapter 2 gives the example</text>
  <text start="188.05" dur="5.61">of Paul rebuking Peter to his face in</text>
  <text start="190.96" dur="5.67">public now where does this whole thing</text>
  <text start="193.66" dur="6.69">about rebuking come from it comes from</text>
  <text start="196.63" dur="5.91">if you go to Leviticus chapter 19 this</text>
  <text start="200.35" dur="5.55">is actually a very loving thing to do in</text>
  <text start="202.54" dur="6.6">Leviticus chapter 19 starting in verse</text>
  <text start="205.9" dur="6.54">17 you shall not hate your brother in</text>
  <text start="209.14" dur="5.76">your heart you shall in any wise rebuke</text>
  <text start="212.44" dur="5.1">your neighbor and not suffer sin upon</text>
  <text start="214.9" dur="4.17">him see this is actually a love it you</text>
  <text start="217.54" dur="4.08">see our culture is so politically</text>
  <text start="219.07" dur="4.08">correct and so wishy-washy and</text>
  <text start="221.62" dur="3.45">milquetoast that they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="223.15" dur="3.09">understand and most of the church world</text>
  <text start="225.07" dur="4.47">whether it&amp;#39;s Christian or messianic</text>
  <text start="226.24" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t understand that if you stay silent</text>
  <text start="229.54" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s actually a hateful thing you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="231.85" dur="3.87">hating your brother but you&amp;#39;re not to</text>
  <text start="234.25" dur="4.17">hate your brother or sister in your</text>
  <text start="235.72" dur="4.65">heart so you will in any wise rebuke</text>
  <text start="238.42" dur="3.48">your neighbor and you shall not suffer</text>
  <text start="240.37" dur="2.61">simin upon him so if you see your</text>
  <text start="241.9" dur="3.18">neighbor and who&amp;#39;s your neighbor</text>
  <text start="242.98" dur="3.27">well Yahshua made this very clear when</text>
  <text start="245.08" dur="3.42">he told the parable of the Good</text>
  <text start="246.25" dur="4.05">Samaritan our neighbor is everyone it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="3.959">not just certain people we know our</text>
  <text start="250.3" dur="4.65">neighbors everyone so if we see sin on</text>
  <text start="252.459" dur="4.53">our neighbor especially if there are a</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="3.659">brother or sister and yah we were to</text>
  <text start="256.989" dur="4.591">rebuke them we&amp;#39;re not supposed to suffer</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="5.071">sin upon them so it&amp;#39;s very critical to</text>
  <text start="261.58" dur="3.48">rebuke now if they sin against you</text>
  <text start="263.68" dur="2.44">personally yeah</text>
  <text start="265.06" dur="2.44">rebuke them in private</text>
  <text start="266.12" dur="2.85">take them aside and if they don&amp;#39;t hear</text>
  <text start="267.5" dur="2.85">you then bring some witnesses and if</text>
  <text start="268.97" dur="2.37">they still don&amp;#39;t hear you then you make</text>
  <text start="270.35" dur="3.75">it public and bring it before the</text>
  <text start="271.34" dur="4.859">assembly however if this brother or</text>
  <text start="274.1" dur="4.02">sister rebukes before everyone you are</text>
  <text start="276.199" dur="4.53">to rebuke them before all that is very</text>
  <text start="278.12" dur="5.76">scriptural and rooted in first Timothy 5</text>
  <text start="280.729" dur="5.311">verse 20 this is very very important and</text>
  <text start="283.88" dur="4.5">the reason I&amp;#39;m teaching this is because</text>
  <text start="286.04" dur="5.099">I&amp;#39;ve had some recent examples of this</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="4.38">happening contrary to popular belief I</text>
  <text start="291.139" dur="4.171">do not enjoy going around rebuking</text>
  <text start="292.76" dur="4.68">people I I much prefer being with the</text>
  <text start="295.31" dur="4.579">joyful Saints and and and loving them</text>
  <text start="297.44" dur="4.62">and being with them in fact this new</text>
  <text start="299.889" dur="4.06">messianic congregation I&amp;#39;m going to down</text>
  <text start="302.06" dur="3.69">and say in the cornerstone there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="303.949" dur="4.051">sin going on there these people love</text>
  <text start="305.75" dur="3.75">yeah so I don&amp;#39;t have to rebuke I love</text>
  <text start="308" dur="2.669">being there in fact I can&amp;#39;t wait to go</text>
  <text start="309.5" dur="3.24">there and I never want to leave when I</text>
  <text start="310.669" dur="5.431">went when the service is over I love it</text>
  <text start="312.74" dur="5.459">but recently you know I went to this</text>
  <text start="316.1" dur="4.319">Passover last spring where there is a</text>
  <text start="318.199" dur="4.051">man who was there with his wife and he</text>
  <text start="320.419" dur="4.401">got drunk to the point where he was</text>
  <text start="322.25" dur="4.8">slurring his words on Passover and</text>
  <text start="324.82" dur="4.27">scripturally I should have rebuked him</text>
  <text start="327.05" dur="2.58">publicly to his face in front of</text>
  <text start="329.09" dur="3.15">everyone</text>
  <text start="329.63" dur="3.75">now I didn&amp;#39;t I was wrong I actually did</text>
  <text start="332.24" dur="1.5">not because I didn&amp;#39;t want to rock the</text>
  <text start="333.38" dur="2.43">boat</text>
  <text start="333.74" dur="4.41">but eventually I did but he needed to be</text>
  <text start="335.81" dur="3.75">rebuked publicly and then these</text>
  <text start="338.15" dur="4.97">organizers of the love for Israel</text>
  <text start="339.56" dur="5.579">conference Hank and Marilee Hopson they</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="4.09">publicly in front of everyone after</text>
  <text start="345.139" dur="4.381">Shabbat had started so this was after</text>
  <text start="347.21" dur="5.329">Friday night they publicly asked people</text>
  <text start="349.52" dur="5.519">to give them money to pay off a debt to</text>
  <text start="352.539" dur="3.281">to pay off the debt they incurred to put</text>
  <text start="355.039" dur="2.901">on this conference</text>
  <text start="355.82" dur="3.81">well that is sin so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.94" dur="3.49">transgressing the Shabbat you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="359.63" dur="4.319">supposed to be asking or soliciting</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="5.28">money or funds especially pay off a debt</text>
  <text start="363.949" dur="4.741">on Shabbat they send publicly they need</text>
  <text start="366.71" dur="6.03">to be rebuked publicly that others may</text>
  <text start="368.69" dur="6">fear I was going to this one Bible study</text>
  <text start="372.74" dur="4.62">where the teacher would constantly lob</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="5.039">these very mean and sarcastic comments</text>
  <text start="377.36" dur="4.44">at this young man who was who was there</text>
  <text start="379.729" dur="3.571">and he was doing this in front of</text>
  <text start="381.8" dur="4.89">everyone well that guy needed to be</text>
  <text start="383.3" dur="6.42">rebuked publicly in front of everyone</text>
  <text start="386.69" dur="4.8">so when someone sends in public they</text>
  <text start="389.72" dur="4.92">need to be held accountable in public</text>
  <text start="391.49" dur="7.13">they need to be rebuked in public and</text>
  <text start="394.64" dur="7.4">that is a very very important</text>
  <text start="398.62" dur="5.28">necessary tool to be used by the body</text>
  <text start="402.04" dur="3.48">Messiah in order to keep things in check</text>
  <text start="403.9" dur="3.69">otherwise sin will just start running</text>
  <text start="405.52" dur="4.5">rampant people will grow lukewarm and</text>
  <text start="407.59" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;ll have the lifeless dead body of</text>
  <text start="410.02" dur="3.959">Messiah that unfortunately you have in</text>
  <text start="411.91" dur="3.479">many places now not everywhere but in a</text>
  <text start="413.979" dur="2.791">lot of places whether it&amp;#39;s Christian or</text>
  <text start="415.389" dur="2.971">messianic a lot of places are dead</text>
  <text start="416.77" dur="4.95">because sin just doesn&amp;#39;t get rebuked and</text>
  <text start="418.36" dur="5.309">he just goes unchecked so this is a very</text>
  <text start="421.72" dur="3.36">very important doctrine and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="423.669" dur="3.75">make this video to make this crystal</text>
  <text start="425.08" dur="4.08">clear when it&amp;#39;s appropriate to rebuke a</text>
  <text start="427.419" dur="4.261">brother or sister in the Lord in the</text>
  <text start="429.16" dur="4.5">Messiah publicly and when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="431.68" dur="2.88">supposed to do it privately and even in</text>
  <text start="433.66" dur="2.22">the one where you&amp;#39;re supposed to do it</text>
  <text start="434.56" dur="2.97">privately where they sin against you</text>
  <text start="435.88" dur="4.069">personally if they still don&amp;#39;t repent</text>
  <text start="437.53" dur="4.53">eventually it will be made public so</text>
  <text start="439.949" dur="3.491">hallelujah yas is much more interested</text>
  <text start="442.06" dur="2.79">in bringing us to repentance than he is</text>
  <text start="443.44" dur="3">about our feelings about whether we get</text>
  <text start="444.85" dur="3.629">embarrassed or not so it&amp;#39;s important to</text>
