  <text start="0.05" dur="7.84">well Shalom or shabbat shalom - most of</text>
  <text start="4.92" dur="8.16">the country it is Friday night April the</text>
  <text start="7.89" dur="8.1">3rd 2015 Passover day the 14th of Aviv</text>
  <text start="13.08" dur="5.369">is just about to end here on the west</text>
  <text start="15.99" dur="5.19">coast as Twilight settles across the</text>
  <text start="18.449" dur="5.58">land as I make this podcast and we are</text>
  <text start="21.18" dur="5.49">going into the fifteenth day of Aviv or</text>
  <text start="24.029" dur="5.371">otherwise known as the first day of</text>
  <text start="26.67" dur="4.23">unleavened bread because once it is</text>
  <text start="29.4" dur="4.409">totally dark and the weekly Shabbat has</text>
  <text start="30.9" dur="5.46">begun the first of the seven days of</text>
  <text start="33.809" dur="6.151">unleavened bread begins I took a photo</text>
  <text start="36.36" dur="6.87">of one plate of our Passover Seder our</text>
  <text start="39.96" dur="7.14">Seder feast tonight I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="43.23" dur="5.849">show off the nice Passover Seder plates</text>
  <text start="47.1" dur="6.9">that we had prepared for our feast</text>
  <text start="49.079" dur="7.23">tonight which we just now finished if</text>
  <text start="54" dur="4.559">you look at the the plate that I have in</text>
  <text start="56.309" dur="4.32">the picture here you&amp;#39;ll see the bowl on</text>
  <text start="58.559" dur="4.651">the right is actually a bowl filled of</text>
  <text start="60.629" dur="4.411">karasek I don&amp;#39;t normally make Cara set</text>
  <text start="63.21" dur="5.1">because it&amp;#39;s not one of the dishes</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="5.939">required in exodus 12 but I had some</text>
  <text start="68.31" dur="5.01">help this feast of Passover so we have</text>
  <text start="70.979" dur="4.561">some nice cara set which is actually</text>
  <text start="73.32" dur="3.96">really simple to make it just requires</text>
  <text start="75.54" dur="3.149">some apples and walnuts and a little bit</text>
  <text start="77.28" dur="4.229">of cinnamon and brown sugar and some</text>
  <text start="78.689" dur="4.591">some kosher wine and you just sort of</text>
  <text start="81.509" dur="3.18">mix it all together and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="83.28" dur="4.26">really good you can find recipes on the</text>
  <text start="84.689" dur="4.921">internet but the carer set represents</text>
  <text start="87.54" dur="4.079">the sweetness of being liberated from</text>
  <text start="89.61" dur="4.14">the bondage of the Egyptians or the</text>
  <text start="91.619" dur="4.411">sweetness of Yahshua&amp;#39;s blood liberating</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="4.89">us from sin now of course we have the</text>
  <text start="96.03" dur="4.74">glass of grape juice or wine there we</text>
  <text start="98.64" dur="4.759">have the menorah as a nice background</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="5.279">and then you see on the actual plate</text>
  <text start="103.399" dur="6.371">itself we have the elements of the</text>
  <text start="106.049" dur="5.761">exodus 12 Passover meal we have the</text>
  <text start="109.77" dur="4.05">unleavened bread which of course</text>
  <text start="111.81" dur="4.08">unleavened bread is always filled with</text>
  <text start="113.82" dur="5.07">symbolism because it is both striped and</text>
  <text start="115.89" dur="5.939">pierced just as Yahshua was striped and</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="4.2">pierced when he was beaten and nailed to</text>
  <text start="121.829" dur="3.371">the tree</text>
  <text start="123.09" dur="6.339">that lump of</text>
  <text start="125.2" dur="6.33">of white yellowish stuff is the</text>
  <text start="129.429" dur="4.53">horseradish that symbolizes the</text>
  <text start="131.53" dur="4.08">bitterness of the bondage that the</text>
  <text start="133.959" dur="4.441">children of Israel were in under the</text>
  <text start="135.61" dur="5.129">slavery to the Egyptians also symbolizes</text>
  <text start="138.4" dur="5.309">the bitterness of sin in our lives</text>
  <text start="140.739" dur="4.321">before Yahshua sets us free the</text>
  <text start="143.709" dur="4.831">unleavened bread of course represents</text>
  <text start="145.06" dur="5.91">Yahshua was body he is without sin just</text>
  <text start="148.54" dur="4.41">as this bread is without leaven and of</text>
  <text start="150.97" dur="3.57">course he was also piercing striped on</text>
  <text start="152.95" dur="3.24">the Passover day that we&amp;#39;re celebrating</text>
  <text start="154.54" dur="3.96">today</text>
  <text start="156.19" dur="3.51">the green is parsley which is another</text>
  <text start="158.5" dur="3.209">bitter herb because it does say you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="159.7" dur="3.78">supposed to eat this with the eagle and</text>
  <text start="161.709" dur="4.081">with unleavened bread and bitter herbs</text>
  <text start="163.48" dur="4.229">curls so the two bitter herbs I have</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="4.08">here on horseradish and parsley which</text>
  <text start="167.709" dur="4.11">tend to be the traditional bitter herbs</text>
  <text start="169.87" dur="4.56">that are eaten that most Passover meals</text>
  <text start="171.819" dur="4.23">doesn&amp;#39;t have to be necessarily those two</text>
  <text start="174.43" dur="4.11">bitter herbs but those are the</text>
  <text start="176.049" dur="4.351">traditional ones that we eat the parsley</text>
  <text start="178.54" dur="3.539">of course and the horseradish they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="180.4" dur="4.11">both bitter when you eat them the</text>
  <text start="182.079" dur="3.69">horseradish especially particularly if</text>
  <text start="184.51" dur="3.69">you get the pure horseradish which is</text>
  <text start="185.769" dur="4.47">what I got will tell me if you take</text>
  <text start="188.2" dur="4.47">another of it that will make your your</text>
  <text start="190.239" dur="4.171">eyes start watering and it&amp;#39;ll clear out</text>
  <text start="192.67" dur="3.51">your sinuses it really tastes very very</text>
  <text start="194.41" dur="3.27">bitter one thing though that you might</text>
  <text start="196.18" dur="5.179">want to try which is really neat is if</text>
  <text start="197.68" dur="6.899">you take maybe two slices of broken</text>
  <text start="201.359" dur="5.021">matzo unleavened bread and you and you</text>
  <text start="204.579" dur="2.88">put some horseradish in between you eat</text>
  <text start="206.38" dur="2.639">it</text>
  <text start="207.459" dur="3.601">of course it will be very bitter and</text>
  <text start="209.019" dur="4.711">your eyes may start watering but then</text>
  <text start="211.06" dur="5.489">take two more slices of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="213.73" dur="4.409">and and put some care set in between it</text>
  <text start="216.549" dur="3.241">and then eat it and you&amp;#39;ll be amazed</text>
  <text start="218.139" dur="3.391">about how the combination of the care</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="5.849">set completely takes away the bitterness</text>
  <text start="221.53" dur="5.91">of the horseradish and takes away those</text>
  <text start="225.639" dur="4.47">tears so it&amp;#39;s a really cool little</text>
  <text start="227.44" dur="6.35">symbolism there built into this Passover</text>
  <text start="230.109" dur="7.71">meal then of course you see the cooked</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="5.09">land there now some of the Passover&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.819" dur="3.671">don&amp;#39;t have the land</text>
  <text start="238.88" dur="6.24">they think that because the Astra was</text>
  <text start="241.49" dur="5.13">the ultimate lamb that went to the cross</text>
  <text start="245.12" dur="2.79">that we should meet lamb but I think we</text>
  <text start="246.62" dur="3.27">should because that&amp;#39;s what Exodus 12</text>
  <text start="247.91" dur="3.87">says to do we eat the lamb the lamb of</text>
  <text start="249.89" dur="6.24">course does represent Yahshua as the</text>
  <text start="251.78" dur="6.959">perfect innocent sacrifice the wine of</text>
  <text start="256.13" dur="4.29">course represents his blood this is the</text>
  <text start="258.739" dur="4.981">ultimate communion if you will the</text>
  <text start="260.42" dur="5.31">ultimate Passover that we are commanded</text>
  <text start="263.72" dur="4.26">to do it says you know if you as I was</text>
  <text start="265.73" dur="5.07">reading through Exodus 12 today during</text>
  <text start="267.98" dur="4.53">the Seder that we did I was just struck</text>
  <text start="270.8" dur="3.96">at how many times it said over over</text>
  <text start="272.51" dur="4.41">again this will be a an ordinance</text>
  <text start="274.76" dur="3.57">forever throughout all generations I</text>
  <text start="276.92" dur="3.33">mean we&amp;#39;re commanded to the semen today</text>
  <text start="278.33" dur="4.53">of course we know that Yahshua fulfilled</text>
  <text start="280.25" dur="4.35">this feast he literally died on the</text>
  <text start="282.86" dur="3.15">Passover me he was literally on the</text>
  <text start="284.6" dur="3.69">cross as they were slaughtering the</text>
  <text start="286.01" dur="3.81">lambs and he died as the lambs are being</text>
  <text start="288.29" dur="4.89">slaughtered and killed and prepared to</text>
  <text start="289.82" dur="4.77">be eaten so we know he fulfilled this</text>
  <text start="293.18" dur="2.91">but we do this as a memorial</text>
  <text start="294.59" dur="3.77">because member we also set the Last</text>
  <text start="296.09" dur="4.95">Supper research do this in memory of me</text>
  <text start="298.36" dur="4.84">do this in remembrance of me so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="301.04" dur="4.41">doing this in remembrance of Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="303.2" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s just amazing how every element on</text>
  <text start="305.45" dur="4.95">this plate symbolizes something about</text>
  <text start="308.15" dur="4.98">the atonement the sacrifice the</text>
  <text start="310.4" dur="5.31">bitterness of sin or the release from</text>
  <text start="313.13" dur="5.13">bondage from sin the other thing I</text>
  <text start="315.71" dur="4.31">noticed even without the care set you</text>
  <text start="318.26" dur="4.62">just look at the elements on the plate</text>
  <text start="320.02" dur="4.99">which are drawn directly from Exodus 12</text>
  <text start="322.88" dur="4.23">I noticed that when I would eat some</text>
  <text start="325.01" dur="4.08">horseradish that was bitter my eyes</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="4.61">turned watering if I started eating a</text>
  <text start="329.09" dur="4.77">little lamb after that the lamb itself</text>
  <text start="331.72" dur="3.73">because of the acidity of the meat would</text>
  <text start="333.86" dur="4.86">instantly take away the bitterness of</text>
  <text start="335.45" dur="6.36">the horseradish as well so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="338.72" dur="5.82">really interesting so all the elements</text>
  <text start="341.81" dur="5.1">are here for the Passover Seder I just</text>
  <text start="344.54" dur="5.64">wanted to briefly show off one plate</text>
  <text start="346.91" dur="5.04">from our passover feast and describe the</text>
  <text start="350.18" dur="3.63">different elements of that plate and how</text>
  <text start="351.95" dur="3.45">it all points to our Yahshua and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.81" dur="2.319">the neat thing about these feasts when</text>
  <text start="355.4" dur="3.009">you</text>
  <text start="356.129" dur="4.68">you know come out of the pagan feasts</text>
  <text start="358.409" dur="3.6">that Christians are idolizing like</text>
  <text start="360.809" dur="2.79">Christmas and Easter and you and</text>
  <text start="362.009" dur="4.05">actually do the feasts that are in</text>
  <text start="363.599" dur="4.86">scriptures like Passover like Sukkot</text>
  <text start="366.059" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s amazing every element of the cease</text>
  <text start="368.459" dur="5.46">just points directly toward Yahshua so I</text>
  <text start="371.189" dur="5.1">hope you&amp;#39;re all either enjoying or are</text>
  <text start="373.919" dur="5.25">about to enjoy or have enjoyed your</text>
  <text start="376.289" dur="5.22">Passover Seder you know it&amp;#39;s funny I I</text>
  <text start="379.169" dur="5.61">always eat fast I probably eat faster</text>
  <text start="381.509" dur="4.59">than I should but this meal were</text>
  <text start="384.779" dur="2.73">commanded this is an excerpt over</text>
  <text start="386.099" dur="4.05">comminity eat this in haste so I was</text>
  <text start="387.509" dur="4.231">able to eat fast because and it was</text>
  <text start="390.149" dur="3.51">actually command from yes that was kind</text>
  <text start="391.74" dur="3.09">of neat the lamb was so good so it was</text>
  <text start="393.659" dur="2.46">easy to eat it taste</text>
  <text start="394.83" dur="2.639">that&amp;#39;s what supposed to do we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="396.119" dur="3.75">supposed to have stabs in her hand and I</text>
  <text start="397.469" dur="4.23">was holding a staff or our feet shot is</text>
  <text start="399.869" dur="4.35">it is as if we&amp;#39;re prepared to go on a</text>
  <text start="401.699" dur="5.101">journey but our children ask why why are</text>
  <text start="404.219" dur="4.141">we eating with a staff in her hand our</text>
  <text start="406.8" dur="3">feet shot eyes up we&amp;#39;re about to go on</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="2.639">our journey we explained our children</text>
  <text start="409.8" dur="3.239">because this symbolizes when the</text>
  <text start="410.999" dur="4.02">children Israel are about to leave want</text>
  <text start="413.039" dur="3.48">to leave their bondage of you know</text>
  <text start="415.019" dur="3.54">several hundred years in Egypt and</text>
  <text start="416.519" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re about to leave and why do we</text>
  <text start="418.559" dur="2.73">have the unleavened raggle because they</text>
  <text start="419.879" dur="3.87">couldn&amp;#39;t leaven their bread because they</text>
  <text start="421.289" dur="6.18">were kicked out of Egypt after the first</text>
  <text start="423.749" dur="6.48">form was slain by Yahweh and and so they</text>
  <text start="427.469" dur="5.46">left and all of these things symbolize</text>
  <text start="430.229" dur="4.44">that first Passover as well as the</text>
  <text start="432.929" dur="4.35">Passover 2,000 years ago that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="434.669" dur="5.7">fulfilled so Happy Passover everyone</text>

  <text start="440.369" dur="4.65">Passover plate looks as beautiful as</text>
  <text start="442.679" dur="4.32">this and if you didn&amp;#39;t have Passover</text>
  <text start="445.019" dur="4.14">hopefully this will inspire you to start</text>
  <text start="446.999" dur="3.72">doing the Passover you can still get in</text>
  <text start="449.159" dur="4.86">on Passover you can have unleavened</text>
  <text start="450.719" dur="5.01">bread or remember if you miss Passover</text>
  <text start="454.019" dur="4.11">this year you can the Torah allows you</text>
  <text start="455.729" dur="4.16">to do Passover next month you can do</text>
  <text start="458.129" dur="3.5">Passover in the second month</text>
  <text start="459.889" dur="4.981">it allows you to if you missed this</text>
  <text start="461.629" dur="4.56">Passover so anyway shabbat shalom -</text>
  <text start="464.87" dur="3.21">everyone is the first day of unleavened</text>
  <text start="466.189" dur="4.47">bread the high Sabbath is beginning and</text>
  <text start="468.08" dur="4.38">the regular weekly Sabbath shabbat</text>
  <text start="470.659" dur="3.72">shalom - everyone out there as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="472.46" dur="5.429">beginning the seven days of unleavened</text>
  <text start="474.379" dur="6.09">bread Shalom Shalom</text>
  <text start="477.889" dur="4.14">oh I&amp;#39;m sorry there&amp;#39;s one other thing I</text>
  <text start="480.469" dur="3.991">just remembered I wanted it mentioned I</text>
  <text start="482.029" dur="4.35">was looking at the calendar and you know</text>
  <text start="484.46" dur="3.239">I mentioned in a video last night the</text>
  <text start="486.379" dur="4.59">Passover happens on a different day</text>
  <text start="487.699" dur="5.161">every year but this year what struck me</text>
  <text start="490.969" dur="3.81">was that the seven days of unleavened</text>
  <text start="492.86" dur="3.899">bread of course start tonight Friday</text>
  <text start="494.779" dur="4.14">night and they stretch all the way</text>
  <text start="496.759" dur="3.9">through next Friday night the seventh</text>
  <text start="498.919" dur="4.291">day begins on April 9th Thursday night</text>
  <text start="500.659" dur="4.62">and ends on Friday night has the weekly</text>
  <text start="503.21" dur="3.54">Shabbat begins and what struck me is I</text>
  <text start="505.279" dur="3.121">realized that this year rather than</text>
  <text start="506.75" dur="4.05">having seven days of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="508.4" dur="4.999">we&amp;#39;re actually gonna have eight days of</text>
  <text start="510.8" dur="5.399">unleavened bread because by the time</text>
  <text start="513.399" dur="5.05">Friday night hits and darkness is over</text>
  <text start="516.199" dur="3.63">the land and it&amp;#39;s no longer the feast of</text>
  <text start="518.449" dur="3.421">unleavened bread which means we can go</text>
  <text start="519.829" dur="3.63">and buy yeast or we can bring east our</text>
  <text start="521.87" dur="3.36">house we can start making bread we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="523.459" dur="4.291">be able to because it&amp;#39;ll be the weekly</text>
  <text start="525.23" dur="4.41">Shabbat and so we&amp;#39;re not able to buy and</text>
  <text start="527.75" dur="3.51">sell or will purchase things or even</text>
  <text start="529.64" dur="4.83">bake cook things like that</text>
  <text start="531.26" dur="4.86">so yah has sort of forced us to have not</text>
  <text start="534.47" dur="3.42">just seven days of unleavened bread but</text>
  <text start="536.12" dur="3.149">literally eight days in eleven bread</text>
  <text start="537.89" dur="3.509">because the weekly Sabbath happens to</text>
  <text start="539.269" dur="4.141">fall right up against the seventh day of</text>
  <text start="541.399" dur="3.75">unleavened bread and I was pondering</text>
  <text start="543.41" dur="3.51">that I think that has some prophetic</text>
  <text start="545.149" dur="3.961">significance I think it&amp;#39;s showing us</text>
  <text start="546.92" dur="4.26">that yeah saying look we&amp;#39;re about to</text>
  <text start="549.11" dur="4.77">enter into a season into a time where</text>
