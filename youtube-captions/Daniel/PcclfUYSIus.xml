  <text start="260.829" dur="4.631">with genuine repentance and deliverance</text>
  <text start="263.539" dur="3.841">and getting their lives right of course</text>
  <text start="265.46" dur="6.63">this revival like so many in the United</text>
  <text start="267.38" dur="7.56">States it died it died because people</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="4.17">get comfortable in their sin and they</text>
  <text start="274.94" dur="2.67">get comfortable with the way things are</text>

  <text start="282.11" dur="2.73">I&amp;#39;ve done an article on the Assemblies</text>
  <text start="283.61" dur="3.059">of God even though there are some pure</text>
  <text start="284.84" dur="2.91">hearts within the Assemblies of God just</text>
  <text start="286.669" dur="3.271">like there are pure hearts within the</text>
  <text start="287.75" dur="3.51">Roman Catholic Church and others you</text>
  <text start="289.94" dur="3.21">need to come out of this stuff because</text>
  <text start="291.26" dur="5.46">the Assemblies of God is a child sex</text>
  <text start="293.15" dur="6.57">trafficking denomination and it was even</text>
  <text start="296.72" dur="4.949">birthed because of men who resisted the</text>
  <text start="299.72" dur="3.569">spirit during the Asuza Street revival</text>

  <text start="323.409" dur="6.241">revival occurred back in the 90s so I</text>
  <text start="328.029" dur="5.461">don&amp;#39;t know does that mean something</text>
  <text start="329.65" dur="6.84">III think that storm is upon us has</text>
  <text start="333.49" dur="4.829">really hit the nail on the head where he</text>

  <text start="357.039" dur="2.88">a chance to watch this please go back</text>
  <text start="358.539" dur="3.421">and watch the video I made a couple days</text>
  <text start="359.919" dur="5.28">ago where I link in the description box</text>
  <text start="361.96" dur="7.53">to the presentation by Kevin Shipp the</text>
  <text start="365.199" dur="5.94">ex CIA guy he&amp;#39;s a CIA whistleblower and</text>
  <text start="369.49" dur="3.78">this guy I mean he blows the whole thing</text>
  <text start="371.139" dur="4.11">apart he had this seminar a little bit</text>
  <text start="373.27" dur="5.699">over an hour long in Northern California</text>
  <text start="375.249" dur="5.97">back in the summer of 2017 and he does</text>
  <text start="378.969" dur="4.111">such a good job at exposing the deep</text>
  <text start="381.219" dur="3.961">state the shadow government you know</text>
  <text start="383.08" dur="3.899">there he even says the CIA must be</text>
  <text start="385.18" dur="3.959">completely dismantled I love that he</text>
  <text start="386.979" dur="4.86">says that toward the end and if you if</text>
  <text start="389.139" dur="4.53">you followed my channel or if you go to</text>
  <text start="391.839" dur="3.661">Fiona Barnett&amp;#39;s website you&amp;#39;ll find that</text>
  <text start="393.669" dur="4.68">the CIA from its beginning has been a</text>
  <text start="395.5" dur="5.31">child sex trafficking front that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="398.349" dur="4.141">the CIA does if it was completely when</text>
  <text start="400.81" dur="3.629">you watch this Kevin Shipp video you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="402.49" dur="5.549">find CI is completely out of the balance</text>
  <text start="404.439" dur="5.4">of the Constitution and not even the</text>
  <text start="408.039" dur="3.87">control of the the President or the</text>
  <text start="409.839" dur="4.2">Congress they do all this clandestine</text>
  <text start="411.909" dur="5.34">secret activities which should be</text>
  <text start="414.039" dur="4.4">repugnant to those who value the fact</text>
  <text start="417.249" dur="4.741">that we were supposed to be a</text>
  <text start="418.439" dur="7.271">constitutional republic although Kevin</text>
  <text start="421.99" dur="6.179"> makes the point that in so many</text>
  <text start="425.71" dur="3.929">ways in so many different levels of our</text>
  <text start="428.169" dur="4.381">government we are no longer a</text>
  <text start="429.639" dur="4.89">constitutional republic and which is why</text>
  <text start="432.55" dur="4.289">all this horrible stuff has been</text>
  <text start="434.529" dur="3.75">happening actually the root of it is</text>
  <text start="436.839" dur="3.841">even deeper than that it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="438.279" dur="3.781">Americans are selfish and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="440.68" dur="4.319">want to repent and get right with God</text>
  <text start="442.06" dur="4.919">and really obey and keep the scriptures</text>
  <text start="444.999" dur="3.75">out of a love for Jesus filled with the</text>
  <text start="446.979" dur="4.02">spirit even many who claim to be</text>
  <text start="448.749" dur="5.07">followers of Christ and when you lose</text>
  <text start="450.999" dur="3.851">that you lose everything else you lose</text>
  <text start="453.819" dur="4.941">everything</text>
  <text start="454.85" dur="6.04">and so yah in his divine mercy and</text>
  <text start="458.76" dur="5.13">providence says this had a loud</text>
  <text start="460.89" dur="4.56">President Trump to win office and we are</text>
  <text start="463.89" dur="3.72">commanded to pray for our leaders and</text>
  <text start="465.45" dur="4.86">President Trump I believe is doing all</text>
  <text start="467.61" dur="4.47">he can to restore things and to bring</text>
  <text start="470.31" dur="3.36">things back to where they should be and</text>
  <text start="472.08" dur="3.3">one of the biggest evidences of that is</text>
  <text start="473.67" dur="4.44">over the past two years you&amp;#39;ve seen how</text>
