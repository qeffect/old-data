  <text start="187.16" dur="6.329">blatantly liberal pro-choice which is</text>
  <text start="191.239" dur="5.041">really Pro death Pro satanic pedophilia</text>
  <text start="193.489" dur="4.741">because I&amp;#39;ve talked about many times how</text>
  <text start="196.28" dur="5.1">abortion Planned Parenthood that whole</text>
  <text start="198.23" dur="5.009">system is just a big gateway for the</text>
  <text start="201.38" dur="5.88">Satanic pedophiles to harvest the organs</text>
  <text start="203.239" dur="6.171">to harvest yeah organs for their satanic</text>

  <text start="214.519" dur="3.991">not right to choose it actually has to</text>
  <text start="216.11" dur="5.37">do with with satanic pedophilia I think</text>
  <text start="218.51" dur="4.979">if more Americans woke up to that we</text>
  <text start="221.48" dur="3.479">would see a complete and total end to</text>

  <text start="224.959" dur="4.951">waking up to it there are a and like</text>
  <text start="227.269" dur="4.381">that movie unplanned which just wow if</text>

  <text start="238.12" dur="4.03">there&amp;#39;s one scene in particular toward</text>
  <text start="240.53" dur="3.12">the beginning of the film where they</text>
  <text start="242.15" dur="4.44">show what actually happens to this</text>
  <text start="243.65" dur="4.53">little baby on the monitor as the baby</text>
  <text start="246.59" dur="3.989">is getting sucked out of the mother&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="248.18" dur="7.71">womb and it is so horrific so horrifying</text>
  <text start="250.579" dur="7.41">that it&amp;#39;ll wait anyone up i by the way</text>
  <text start="255.89" dur="5.61">speaking of horrific things guys</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="5.641">sometimes that&amp;#39;s all that will wake</text>
  <text start="261.5" dur="2.65">people up people got kind of upset but I</text>
  <text start="263.63" dur="2.83">showed that</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="3.87">photo of that little girl couple days</text>
  <text start="266.46" dur="3.51">ago that have been severely abused by</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="2.52">satanic pedophiles and I know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.97" dur="3">horrific</text>
  <text start="270.54" dur="4.349">but it&amp;#39;s like guys we need to be shot in</text>
  <text start="272.97" dur="3.419">this from the housetops okay if we</text>

  <text start="276.389" dur="4.261">we can&amp;#39;t be like oh you know that</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="4.049">disturbed my sensibilities no it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="280.65" dur="3.51">like the pro-life people who go out in</text>
  <text start="282.539" dur="3.241">front of abortion clinics and they hold</text>
  <text start="284.16" dur="3.81">up pictures of these butchered babies</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="4.199">yes it&amp;#39;s horrific it&amp;#39;s disgusting it</text>
  <text start="287.97" dur="3.96">makes you want to just vomit because</text>
  <text start="289.979" dur="3.631">it&amp;#39;s so gross and horrifying but it</text>
  <text start="291.93" dur="3.09">needs to be put out in the public so</text>
  <text start="293.61" dur="4.38">people can actually understand what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="295.02" dur="5.459">going on all right I&amp;#39;m gonna play this</text>
  <text start="297.99" dur="5.34">clip the latest things going on with the</text>
  <text start="300.479" dur="4.921">House Judiciary debates in this farce of</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="4.83">an impeachment hearing I really like</text>
  <text start="305.4" dur="4.92">what what this gentleman says and so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="308.16" dur="15.99">going to go ahead and play it I can get</text>
  <text start="310.32" dur="17.49">it cute up here things have been going</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="6.72">quickly but I think the real key is is</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="5.46">that were all of the denials of minority</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="5.7">requests both here and in the</text>
  <text start="333.27" dur="5.459">Intelligence Committee the Republicans</text>
  <text start="336.57" dur="6.71">in the president have not been able to</text>
  <text start="338.729" dur="8.101">put on live witnesses to be able to</text>
  <text start="343.28" dur="5.919">basically put together a defense and if</text>
  <text start="346.83" dur="4.019">you&amp;#39;re going to have a trial you have to</text>
  <text start="349.199" dur="3.811">have both the prosecution and the</text>
  <text start="350.849" dur="4.5">defense here we don&amp;#39;t have a defense</text>
  <text start="353.01" dur="3.96">because of the rulings that have been</text>
  <text start="355.349" dur="4.621">made one of which was made just a few</text>
  <text start="356.97" dur="6.87">minutes ago by the chairman of this</text>
  <text start="359.97" dur="7.74">committee now let me say you know first</text>
  <text start="363.84" dur="6.99">of all the hearings that were in the</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="5.459">basement of the Capitol were secret</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="5.64">hearings they were classified hearings</text>
  <text start="373.169" dur="6.631">none of the members who were in that</text>
  <text start="376.47" dur="6.439">hearing room could ethically go out and</text>
  <text start="379.8" dur="6.39">tell the public and the news media</text>
  <text start="382.909" dur="5.051">exactly what was said there and they</text>
  <text start="386.19" dur="3.86">probably could have been hailed before</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="4.97">the Ethics Committee or worse if they</text>
  <text start="390.05" dur="4.619">tempted to do this there were leaks that</text>
  <text start="392.93" dur="4.35">came out of there</text>
  <text start="394.669" dur="5.791">I grant you that but none of the members</text>
  <text start="397.28" dur="5.129">could the other point is is that the</text>
  <text start="400.46" dur="4.769">vast majority of members of the</text>
  <text start="402.409" dur="4.771">Judiciary Committee which has ultimate</text>
  <text start="405.229" dur="4.59">jurisdiction over all proposed</text>
  <text start="407.18" dur="4.739">impeachments were not members of the</text>
  <text start="409.819" dur="5.761">three other committees and were not</text>
  <text start="411.919" dur="6.84">allowed to go in to the basement of the</text>
  <text start="415.58" dur="6.089">Capitol hearing room that listen to what</text>
  <text start="418.759" dur="6.331">was going on so this is very important</text>
  <text start="421.669" dur="5.161">what he&amp;#39;s saying there&amp;#39;s two things two</text>
  <text start="425.09" dur="3.96">major things that basically totally</text>
  <text start="426.83" dur="4.29">invalidate this this impeachment circus</text>
  <text start="429.05" dur="3.63">other than of course the fact that they</text>
  <text start="431.12" dur="2.639">don&amp;#39;t really have anything on President</text>
  <text start="432.68" dur="3.12">Trump that he didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong</text>
  <text start="433.759" dur="3.571">but the whole structure of how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="435.8" dur="3.45">doing this first of all it was done</text>
  <text start="437.33" dur="4.2">secretly just like this gentleman said</text>
  <text start="439.25" dur="4.199">in the basement okay we&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="441.53" dur="3.75">really you can&amp;#39;t really understand how</text>
  <text start="443.449" dur="3.15">what the origin of this these</text>
  <text start="445.28" dur="3.21">impeachment hearings were because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.599" dur="4.53">all classified it&amp;#39;s all it was all</text>
  <text start="448.49" dur="4.56">hidden in the basement and second he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.129" dur="3.481">absolutely right whenever you have a</text>
  <text start="453.05" dur="2.91">trial which is what an impeachment is</text>
  <text start="454.61" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;ve got to have to be able to have a</text>
  <text start="455.96" dur="3.929">defense but so far there&amp;#39;s been no</text>
  <text start="458.18" dur="3.57">defense they have you know Jerry Nadler</text>
  <text start="459.889" dur="3.631">is very clearly not allowed the</text>
  <text start="461.75" dur="5.13">Republicans to have their minority</text>
  <text start="463.52" dur="5.759">meeting to to mount a defense for</text>
  <text start="466.88" dur="5.61">President Trump and so there&amp;#39;s been no</text>
  <text start="469.279" dur="5.281">defense at all so it&amp;#39;s like again this</text>
  <text start="472.49" dur="3.84">is just a total sham and President Trump</text>
  <text start="474.56" dur="3">had actually retweeted that video and so</text>
  <text start="476.33" dur="3.269">I wanted to play it for you guys</text>
  <text start="477.56" dur="3.84">John Ratcliffe I really like John</text>
  <text start="479.599" dur="3.18">Radcliffe he&amp;#39;s always been a very good</text>
  <text start="481.4" dur="4.049">eloquent speaker</text>
  <text start="482.779" dur="5.101">he said Alexander Hamilton said the</text>
  <text start="485.449" dur="4.951">greatest danger of impeachment would be</text>
  <text start="487.88" dur="4.74">depriving a president of due process and</text>
  <text start="490.4" dur="4.109">using impeachment politically by the</text>
  <text start="492.62" dur="3.99">party that has the most votes in the</text>
  <text start="494.509" dur="5.041">house sadly that day has come</text>
  <text start="496.61" dur="6.69">today&amp;#39;s Democrats are the founders worst</text>
  <text start="499.55" dur="4.859">nightmare yeah that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="503.3" dur="3.06">happened and that&amp;#39;s exactly what the</text>
  <text start="504.409" dur="3.6">gentleman before him said is that yeah a</text>
  <text start="506.36" dur="3.179">due process habit has been deprived</text>
  <text start="508.009" dur="4.261">because there&amp;#39;s been no defense allowed</text>
  <text start="509.539" dur="4.88">the the Democrats the satanic pedophile</text>
  <text start="512.27" dur="4.649">Democrats have just ran this through</text>
  <text start="514.419" dur="5.711">even though there are two articles of</text>
  <text start="516.919" dur="5.16">impeachment art really they&amp;#39;re nothing</text>
  <text start="520.13" dur="3.12">right I mean we know this we know about</text>
  <text start="522.079" dur="3.211">the two</text>
  <text start="523.25" dur="3.72">as President Trump released we know what</text>
  <text start="525.29" dur="4.35">the Ukrainian president himself was said</text>
  <text start="526.97" dur="4.38">not once but a couple of times even</text>
  <text start="529.64" dur="4.26">recently saying look there was no</text>
  <text start="531.35" dur="5.34">pressure put upon me but that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="533.9" dur="5.37">matter because these Democrats these</text>
  <text start="536.69" dur="5.28">corrupt officials they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="539.27" dur="4.44">President Trump in office because</text>
  <text start="541.97" dur="3.75">President Trump is going after their</text>
  <text start="543.71" dur="4.56">satanic pedophilia this is what it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="545.72" dur="5.91">about this is what it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="548.27" dur="6.54">all right so another example of now</text>
  <text start="551.63" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re just again not allowing the</text>
  <text start="554.81" dur="4.14">Republicans to actually be able to do</text>
  <text start="556.82" dur="4.89">what the rule says specified it says</text>
  <text start="558.95" dur="4.74">watch again Jerry Nadler makes up his</text>
  <text start="561.71" dur="3.72">own rules denies rights to Republicans</text>
  <text start="563.69" dur="5.64">and refuses to acknowledge long-standing</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="4.55">house rules okay I&amp;#39;ll play this for you</text>
  <text start="569.33" dur="5.97">guys</text>
  <text start="569.98" dur="6.94">and so continue my porn award if I</text>
