  <text start="31.05" dur="4.77">hell breaks loose on Hanukkah when</text>
  <text start="33.53" dur="3.76">Satan&amp;#39;s cast out of the heavenly throne</text>
  <text start="35.82" dur="2.94">room so I wanted to make my days count</text>
  <text start="37.29" dur="4.019">so I got there early I got there around</text>
  <text start="38.76" dur="4.29">eleven twenty in the morning stades</text>
  <text start="41.309" dur="3.301">almost two o&amp;#39;clock it&amp;#39;s almost three</text>
  <text start="43.05" dur="3.84">hours three flowers is preaching my</text>
  <text start="44.61" dur="5.46">heart out started off just preaching on</text>
  <text start="46.89" dur="4.8">some 119 just proclaiming it and for the</text>
  <text start="50.07" dur="3.239">first 45 minutes the crowd was very</text>
  <text start="51.69" dur="3.09">small maybe only a handful of students</text>
  <text start="53.309" dur="3.831">as the conviction of the spirit just</text>
  <text start="54.78" dur="7.079">fell upon you know maybe 10 12 students</text>
  <text start="57.14" dur="6.849">but then around noon or so going into</text>
  <text start="61.859" dur="4.021">the twelve o&amp;#39;clock hour as I began to</text>
  <text start="63.989" dur="4.911">continue to preach on Yahshua his blood</text>
  <text start="65.88" dur="5.25">atonement the Torah obeying him</text>
  <text start="68.9" dur="4.69">eventually the police showed up the</text>
  <text start="71.13" dur="4.02">police just showed up two police cars</text>
  <text start="73.59" dur="3.389">showed up writing on campus and the</text>
  <text start="75.15" dur="5.609">crowd started getting big and big and</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="6.03">big until it got up to maybe 7,500 maybe</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="4.051">over 100 students there was one woman</text>
  <text start="83.009" dur="4.771">who was contentious you know that I had</text>
  <text start="84.81" dur="5.25">to rebuke but she didn&amp;#39;t stay long the</text>
  <text start="87.78" dur="3.39">cop stayed for maybe 30 or 45 minutes</text>
  <text start="90.06" dur="3.3">and then they eventually drove away and</text>
  <text start="91.17" dur="3.78">then as I was beginning to preach and I</text>
  <text start="93.36" dur="2.67">had a few arrogant atheists and things</text>
  <text start="94.95" dur="2.099">trying to say that the earth was</text>
  <text start="96.03" dur="3.21">billions of years old which is</text>
  <text start="97.049" dur="4.131">ridiculous I exalted the age of the</text>
  <text start="99.24" dur="3.96">earth how its young I even explained</text>
  <text start="101.18" dur="3.91">Einstein&amp;#39;s theory of relativity and</text>
  <text start="103.2" dur="3.959">light and how it applies to starlight</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="3.209">why we can see starlight that&amp;#39;s billions</text>
  <text start="107.159" dur="2.881">of light years away even though the</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="3.96">earth in the universe are only 6,000</text>
  <text start="110.04" dur="4.38">years of age and so I explained all this</text>
  <text start="112.259" dur="3.96">and but anyway as the crowd was starting</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="3.57">to get a little bit more contentious</text>
  <text start="116.219" dur="2.94">than than I wanted it because I really</text>
  <text start="117.99" dur="4.71">wanted the spirit of you how to fall in</text>
  <text start="119.159" dur="6.24">sobriety yah just let me start singing</text>
  <text start="122.7" dur="4.26">so I just started singing out springtime</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="3.561">in summer spring time if all that&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="3.77">then I started just singing out some 119</text>
  <text start="128.96" dur="3.6">I literally just began to go for the</text>
  <text start="130.73" dur="4.14">entire solemn just singing it out and</text>
  <text start="132.56" dur="5.04">singing out first John 3 6 through 11</text>
  <text start="134.87" dur="4.38">and as I began to sing and sing and sing</text>
  <text start="137.6" dur="3.12">about Yahshua&amp;#39;s death and burial and</text>
  <text start="139.25" dur="2.84">resurrection I just saying and saying it</text>
  <text start="140.72" dur="5.49">almost turned into like a Broadway</text>
  <text start="142.09" dur="6.64">cantata as I was just singing and the</text>
  <text start="146.21" dur="4.8">crowd began to you know dissipate and</text>
  <text start="148.73" dur="4.77">then for like the last hour I only had a</text>
  <text start="151.01" dur="4.26">small crowd again for maybe maybe 20</text>
  <text start="153.5" dur="4.02">students or so it may be a little more</text>
  <text start="155.27" dur="3.84">but but the students that were there the</text>
  <text start="157.52" dur="2.76">spirit of yah was falling upon them</text>
  <text start="159.11" dur="4.71">there was this one woman sitting in</text>
