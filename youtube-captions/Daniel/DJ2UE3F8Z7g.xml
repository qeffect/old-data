  <text start="75.77" dur="7.349">Yahshua himself participated in in John</text>
  <text start="78.86" dur="6.45">chapter 10 verse 22 I want to talk about</text>

  <text start="85.31" dur="5.43">heart lately and I&amp;#39;m just going to read</text>
  <text start="88.27" dur="5.95">from a book that I&amp;#39;ve been meditating</text>

  <text start="103.34" dur="6.18">to Yahshua to the Messiah and I want to</text>
  <text start="108.2" dur="3.93">read a little bit about what the</text>
  <text start="109.52" dur="5.07">disciples did way back 2,000 years ago</text>
  <text start="112.13" dur="5.609">just before another feast the feast of</text>
  <text start="114.59" dur="4.649">Pentecost are shadowed says first of all</text>
  <text start="117.739" dur="3.33">the disciples had already been converted</text>
  <text start="119.239" dur="4.5">to the Messiah and their faith had be</text>
  <text start="121.069" dur="4.591">confirmed by his resurrection but here</text>
  <text start="123.739" dur="3.961">let me say that conversion to Messiah is</text>
  <text start="125.66" dur="4.049">not to be confused with a consecration</text>
  <text start="127.7" dur="4.44">to the great work of the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.709" dur="4.441">conversion in conversion the soul deals</text>
  <text start="132.14" dur="4.379">directly and personally with the Messiah</text>
  <text start="134.15" dur="4.53">it yields up its prejudices and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.519" dur="4.83">selfishness accepts him trust him I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="138.68" dur="4.5">supremely love sin all this the</text>
  <text start="141.349" dur="3.811">disciples had more or less distinctly</text>
  <text start="143.18" dur="3.99">done but they had not received a</text>
  <text start="145.16" dur="4.95">definite Commission yet or a particular</text>
  <text start="147.17" dur="5.25">infusion of power to fulfill that very</text>
  <text start="150.11" dur="3.93">great commission however when Messiah</text>
  <text start="152.42" dur="3.63">had dispelled the great bewilderment</text>
  <text start="154.04" dur="3.51">resulting from his crucifixion and</text>
  <text start="156.05" dur="3.329">confirmed their faith by repeated</text>
  <text start="157.55" dur="4.019">interviews with them he gave them their</text>
  <text start="159.379" dur="4.53">Great Commission to win all nations to</text>
  <text start="161.569" dur="3.931">himself but he admonished them to wait</text>
  <text start="163.909" dur="4.261">in Jerusalem until they were clothed</text>
  <text start="165.5" dur="4.97">with power from on high which he said</text>
  <text start="168.17" dur="5.19">they would receive in a few days now</text>
  <text start="170.47" dur="5.23">observe what they did they assembled the</text>
  <text start="173.36" dur="4.26">men and women for prayer they accepted</text>
  <text start="175.7" dur="3.179">the Commission no doubt they came to an</text>
  <text start="177.62" dur="2.94">understanding of the nature of the</text>
  <text start="178.879" dur="3.48">Commission and the necessity of the</text>
  <text start="180.56" dur="4.769">spiritual outpouring that Messiah had</text>
  <text start="182.359" dur="3.731">promised as they continued day after day</text>
  <text start="185.329" dur="2.951">in prayer</text>
  <text start="186.09" dur="3.63">self-examination they undoubtedly came</text>
  <text start="188.28" dur="3.3">to appreciate more and more the</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="3.84">difficulties that would de set them to</text>
  <text start="191.58" dur="4.59">feel more and more than a good adequacy</text>
  <text start="193.56" dur="4.679">to the task one must conclude that they</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="3.959">won it all consecrated themselves of all</text>
  <text start="198.239" dur="4.201">they had the conversion of the world as</text>
  <text start="200.129" dur="4.051">their life work they must have renounced</text>

  <text start="215.43" dur="4.169">have preceded their actual seeking of</text>

  <text start="230.819" dur="4.2">before them they had a promise of power</text>
  <text start="232.86" dur="4.11">to perform it they were admonished to</text>
  <text start="235.019" dur="4.291">wait until the promise was fulfilled and</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="5.19">how did they wait not in listlessness</text>
  <text start="239.31" dur="4.47">and an activity not making preparations</text>
  <text start="242.16" dur="3.359">by studying otherwise to get along</text>

  <text start="247.049" dur="3.871">prayer the promise might be fulfilled</text>
  <text start="248.37" dur="4.769">rather they continued in prayer and</text>
  <text start="250.92" dur="4.23">persisted in their petitions until the</text>
  <text start="253.139" dur="4.44">answer came they an assured that it was</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="3.839">to be a baptism of the Holy Spirit they</text>
  <text start="257.579" dur="3.78">understood that it was to be received</text>
  <text start="258.989" dur="4.351">from the Messiah they prayed in faith</text>
