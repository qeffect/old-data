  <text start="128.789" dur="7.471">read on the shabbat so man last shabbat</text>
  <text start="133.62" dur="3.99">when Jerry and I went out preaching it</text>
  <text start="136.26" dur="4.5">was unlike a preaching I&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="137.61" dur="6.93">experienced just because the reaction</text>
  <text start="140.76" dur="6.15">was so positive and I mean usually the</text>
  <text start="144.54" dur="4.529">reaction is is typically negative and</text>
  <text start="146.91" dur="3.75">you get people who are upset and</text>
  <text start="149.069" dur="5.181">everything but there was just a real</text>
  <text start="150.66" dur="6.96">sobriety and conviction of the Spirit</text>
  <text start="154.25" dur="6.28">Jerry was able to share his testimony in</text>
  <text start="157.62" dur="5.07">depth with with a lady who approached us</text>
  <text start="160.53" dur="4.65">after the preaching was over sharing</text>
  <text start="162.69" dur="4.17">details of how he escaped the communist</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="4.44">Poland back in nineteen eighty four and</text>
  <text start="166.86" dur="5.4">how yah was with him and it was just it</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="5.399">was just an incredible credible time of</text>
  <text start="172.26" dur="4.619">preaching I know Jerry he just had these</text>
  <text start="175.019" dur="5.55">tears coming down his eyes at one point</text>
  <text start="176.879" dur="5.431">as he was warning warning the people of</text>
  <text start="180.569" dur="4.5">this nation that you know we need to</text>
  <text start="182.31" dur="5.33">repent we need to turn back to him in</text>
  <text start="185.069" dur="4.741">order to avoid the judgment to come</text>
  <text start="187.64" dur="4.03">there&amp;#39;s a lot of crazy things going on</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="3.81">in the world right now and the verse</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="5.099">that just keeps coming to my mind over</text>
  <text start="193.62" dur="4.949">and over and over and over again and</text>
  <text start="196.769" dur="3.661">it&amp;#39;s a verse that I think most people</text>
  <text start="198.569" dur="5.971">are pretty familiar with but it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="8.309">Romans and it&amp;#39;s romans 8 28 romans 8 28</text>
  <text start="204.54" dur="6.72">and it says and we know that all things</text>
  <text start="208.739" dur="5.071">work together for good to them that love</text>
  <text start="211.26" dur="7.33">yah and to them who are called according</text>
  <text start="213.81" dur="7.36">to his purpose love</text>
  <text start="218.59" dur="5.009">we love ya and we love our neighbor when</text>
  <text start="221.17" dur="4.41">love is the the hallmark and the the</text>
  <text start="223.599" dur="5.161">center of our life charity the very</text>
  <text start="225.58" dur="7.17">center of what Torah is because Yahshua</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="6.539">is he is love he is love love not in the</text>
  <text start="232.75" dur="4.56">way that you know our culture defines it</text>
  <text start="235.299" dur="3.541">today which is sort of a selfish</text>
  <text start="237.31" dur="4.22">fuzzy-wuzzy you know let&amp;#39;s tell her</text>
  <text start="238.84" dur="5.88">everything tied to love but I love that</text>
  <text start="241.53" dur="4.959">seeks to please him and Revelation it</text>
  <text start="244.72" dur="4.799">says that all things are created for his</text>
  <text start="246.489" dur="6.151">pleasure I love that seeks to walk in</text>
  <text start="249.519" dur="5.28">the commandments walk in his word a love</text>
  <text start="252.64" dur="4.74">that can only come by being covered in</text>
  <text start="254.799" dur="5.521">his blood you know to set us free from</text>
  <text start="257.38" dur="4.68">our past transgressions a love that can</text>
  <text start="260.32" dur="4.44">only come through the indwelling of his</text>
  <text start="262.06" dur="5.46">spirit I&amp;#39;m walking in his spirit and the</text>
  <text start="264.76" dur="5.7">gifts of his spirit but it&amp;#39;s his love</text>
  <text start="267.52" dur="5.82">and when we love him all things that are</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="4.95">going on in our lives and the things</text>
  <text start="273.34" dur="4.98">that are going on around us they all</text>
  <text start="275.41" dur="4.77">work for our good and you know I was</text>
  <text start="278.32" dur="3.69">reflecting that last shabbat when Jerry</text>
  <text start="280.18" dur="2.94">and I went preaching we you know at</text>
  <text start="282.01" dur="3.12">first we weren&amp;#39;t sure we were going to</text>
  <text start="283.12" dur="3.72">go to Pioneer Square and we kind of</text>
  <text start="285.13" dur="3.87">wandered around we thought that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.84" dur="4.35">this one concert going down at the</text>
  <text start="289" dur="4.59">waterfront which wound up not happening</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="3.75">it we got some wrong information and we</text>
  <text start="293.59" dur="3.48">kept wandering around wandering around</text>
  <text start="294.94" dur="4.26">like wondering what what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="297.07" dur="5.969">and then because we wound up reaching</text>
  <text start="299.2" dur="5.88">later than normal at Pioneer Square that</text>
  <text start="303.039" dur="5.94">this amount of shade started creeping</text>
  <text start="305.08" dur="5.22">over the square as we as we continue to</text>
  <text start="308.979" dur="4.291">preach and we realize that it was</text>
  <text start="310.3" dur="4.86">actually a good thing that we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="313.27" dur="4.74">preach to later because the the shade</text>
  <text start="315.16" dur="4.74">not only protected us from the Sun but</text>
  <text start="318.01" dur="3.81">it drew people you know people were able</text>
  <text start="319.9" dur="3.62">to sit down and congregate because they</text>
  <text start="321.82" dur="4.23">weren&amp;#39;t sitting in that hot Summer Sun</text>
