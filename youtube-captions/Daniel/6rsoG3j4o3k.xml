  <text start="5.629" dur="6.64">midweek podcast it is episode 26 and the</text>
  <text start="10.32" dur="6">title is the bread of life versus</text>
  <text start="12.269" dur="6.721">physical manna and again this is based</text>
  <text start="16.32" dur="4.289">off one of my teachings in the teaching</text>
  <text start="18.99" dur="7.89">section which you can find out my</text>
  <text start="20.609" dur="10.7">website wwwspa- ah com ah if you read</text>
  <text start="26.88" dur="7.53">jochen on or john chapter six hmm</text>
  <text start="31.309" dur="6.241">something very very clear emerges as a</text>
  <text start="34.41" dur="6.84">theme for that passage in Scripture and</text>
  <text start="37.55" dur="6.939">what really becomes very evident is that</text>
  <text start="41.25" dur="6.78">the Hebrews the Israelites committed the</text>
  <text start="44.489" dur="5.631">same transgression twice so what do I</text>
  <text start="48.03" dur="4.25">mean by that well in the tanakh</text>
  <text start="50.12" dur="4.99">otherwise known as the Old Testament</text>
  <text start="52.28" dur="5.529">Israel rejected the bread of life the</text>
  <text start="55.11" dur="5.879">Torah that came down from Yahweh through</text>
  <text start="57.809" dur="5.63">mo Shay and instead they lusted after</text>
  <text start="60.989" dur="4.621">the physical mana and physical meat and</text>
  <text start="63.439" dur="4.75">of course we remember the story where</text>
  <text start="65.61" dur="6">they cried out for meat and Yahweh was</text>
  <text start="68.189" dur="5.641">so angry that he dusted says it he</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="5.31">dusted these are lights with feathered</text>
  <text start="73.83" dur="5.399">fowl so much so that that the meat</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="3.51">filled them up so much that it was said</text>
  <text start="79.229" dur="2.64">to have been coming out of their</text>
  <text start="80.43" dur="4.17">nostrils which is to say that they were</text>
  <text start="81.869" dur="4.531">filled with full and even as they were</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="5.04">eating this meat and gorging themselves</text>
  <text start="86.4" dur="8.039">on this meat they were struck down by</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="7.619">Yahweh now in the Gospels the second</text>
  <text start="94.439" dur="4.591">time this happens is Israel again right</text>
  <text start="97.259" dur="4.141">rejects the bread of life this time the</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="4.229">bread of life is the Torah even Yahshua</text>
  <text start="101.4" dur="6.96">the Messiah or the Torah clothed in</text>
  <text start="103.259" dur="7.5">flesh and what did they do the Pharisees</text>
  <text start="108.36" dur="6.899">and Sadducees and the leaders they</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="7.32">demand of Yahshua a physical sign so</text>
  <text start="115.259" dur="5.64">they did the same the same mistake they</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="7.5">made 2,000 years previous with Moe che</text>
  <text start="120.899" dur="6.871">they wanted the physical now if you</text>
  <text start="125.579" dur="5.251">study the Talmud which I don&amp;#39;t recommend</text>
  <text start="127.77" dur="5.98">but the Talmudic Jewish thought patterns</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="6.41">get so wrapped up in the</text>
  <text start="133.75" dur="7.09">that often times they lose sight of the</text>
  <text start="137.24" dur="5.49">spiritual dimension so if you pick up a</text>
  <text start="140.84" dur="3.36">copy of the jewish talmud you&amp;#39;ll find</text>
  <text start="142.73" dur="3.36">that there&amp;#39;s all these rules and</text>
  <text start="144.2" dur="6.6">regulations that that are made up that</text>
  <text start="146.09" dur="6.96">are to regulate your physical life you</text>
  <text start="150.8" dur="7.64">have to have two kitchens you can never</text>
  <text start="153.05" dur="9.24">mix meat and cheese or dairy and cheese</text>
  <text start="158.44" dur="6.64">you have all these different holika or</text>
  <text start="162.29" dur="4.98">rules for sabbath you know don&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="165.08" dur="6.9">electricity don&amp;#39;t drive a car you can</text>
  <text start="167.27" dur="6.3">only walk so many paces and so the</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="5.1">Talmud is all about the physical and</text>
  <text start="173.57" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s so much so an emphasis on the</text>
  <text start="177.08" dur="5.97">physical that it really does become a</text>
  <text start="179.36" dur="5.79">burden as Peter talks about in acts 15</text>
  <text start="183.05" dur="4.71">it becomes a burden and a yoke that no</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="5.88">man can bear not even those who claim to</text>
  <text start="187.76" dur="5.51">follow the Talmud becomes a just a very</text>
  <text start="191.03" dur="5.31">oppressive yoke and it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="193.27" dur="4.15">regulating every physical aspect of your</text>
  <text start="196.34" dur="3.33">life and it&amp;#39;s all wrapped up in the</text>
  <text start="197.42" dur="4.89">physical and so while it claims to be a</text>
  <text start="199.67" dur="4.2">very spiritual piece of work and a</text>
  <text start="202.31" dur="3.209">spiritual commentary on how to obey</text>
  <text start="203.87" dur="3.839">Torah it really is very physical and</text>
  <text start="205.519" dur="4.951">it&amp;#39;s very burdensome and you lose the</text>
  <text start="207.709" dur="4.621">spiritual dimension and and and so many</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="3.66">Jews get so wrapped up in the physical</text>
  <text start="212.33" dur="4.23">Commandments and the traditions of the</text>
  <text start="214.13" dur="4.98">Talmud that they really don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="216.56" dur="5.16">the spiritual dimension of of what is</text>
  <text start="219.11" dur="6.48">actually contained within the Torah with</text>
  <text start="221.72" dur="7.97">in Yahweh&amp;#39;s instructions for men now in</text>
  <text start="225.59" dur="9.38">reaction to the Talmudic Jewish thought</text>
  <text start="229.69" dur="10.269">there there came around 700 BCE the</text>
  <text start="234.97" dur="8.2">Platonic Aristotelian Greek thought that</text>
  <text start="239.959" dur="4.711">totally disdained physical things and</text>
  <text start="243.17" dur="4.37">got wrapped up in a spiritual or</text>
  <text start="244.67" dur="6.18">spiritual so-called so Plato had this</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="5.59">understanding and you know plato was a</text>
  <text start="250.85" dur="6.259">student of Aristotle Plato had this</text>
  <text start="253.13" dur="6.75">understanding that you know spiritual</text>
  <text start="257.109" dur="5.591">activities such as prayer meditation</text>
  <text start="259.88" dur="4.8">these things are much better about much</text>
  <text start="262.7" dur="2.5">higher much more wonderful than the</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="2.68">physical</text>
  <text start="265.2" dur="5.34">things that you might do such as eating</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="5.91">or you know cleaning yourself or maybe</text>
  <text start="270.54" dur="4.86">the act of sex or things like that and</text>
  <text start="273.27" dur="3.72">this is sort of in reaction to the</text>
  <text start="275.4" dur="8">Talmud a Jewish thought that got wrapped</text>
  <text start="276.99" dur="9.48">up in the physical now both mindsets are</text>
  <text start="283.4" dur="5.83">completely wrong because when you come</text>
  <text start="286.47" dur="4.98">to the plato Aristotelian Greek thought</text>
  <text start="289.23" dur="5.1">that these spiritual things are somehow</text>
  <text start="291.45" dur="4.26">better then you lose aspect of the fact</text>
  <text start="294.33" dur="3.21">that the physical is actually very</text>
  <text start="295.71" dur="4.53">important it&amp;#39;s a very real part of my</text>
  <text start="297.54" dur="5.67">life and it&amp;#39;s a very I mean Yahweh made</text>
  <text start="300.24" dur="4.65">us physical beings and the physical</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="3.99">aspects of our life are extremely</text>
  <text start="304.89" dur="5.31">important and so to try to make those</text>
  <text start="307.2" dur="4.91">physical things somehow less or not as</text>
  <text start="310.2" dur="3.95">good or to try to compart</text>
  <text start="312.11" dur="4.78">compartmentalize your life into</text>
  <text start="314.15" dur="4.51">spiritual things and into physical</text>
  <text start="316.89" dur="3.36">things or carnal things that&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="318.66" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s very very wrong and I had a</text>
  <text start="320.25" dur="4.17">podcast about this several weeks ago</text>
  <text start="322.5" dur="4.05">where Keith Green talks about devotion</text>
  <text start="324.42" dur="4.08">and that you know anything that we do</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="5.04">should be holy it&amp;#39;s not just the act of</text>
  <text start="328.5" dur="5.73">prayer going to weekly congregation or</text>
  <text start="331.59" dur="5.28">you know reading your Bible those are</text>
  <text start="334.23" dur="4.65">not just spiritual things but really</text>
  <text start="336.87" dur="4.95">anything cleaning your house or going to</text>
  <text start="338.88" dur="6.06">work or whatever should be spiritual</text>
  <text start="341.82" dur="6">holy acts because we&amp;#39;re not to</text>
  <text start="344.94" dur="4.41">compartmentalize our lives so both</text>
  <text start="347.82" dur="4.71">mindsets are completely wrong they both</text>
  <text start="349.35" dur="7.17">go to opposite extremes now from Genesis</text>
  <text start="352.53" dur="6.65">and the six days of creation we see that</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="5.85">the spiritual and the physical are</text>
  <text start="359.18" dur="7.15">always tied together and cannot be</text>
  <text start="362.37" dur="6.66">separated for example our own physical</text>
  <text start="366.33" dur="5.22">bodies that Yahweh created while we live</text>
  <text start="369.03" dur="8.58">on earth are inseparable from our soul</text>
  <text start="371.55" dur="8.13">and spirit ok so our soul our spirit is</text>
  <text start="377.61" dur="4.89">is totally and completely intertwined</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="4.53">with our physical body and we understand</text>
  <text start="382.5" dur="3.03">that as we continue to read through the</text>
  <text start="384.21" dur="3.42">Tanakh and through the prophets</text>
  <text start="385.53" dur="3.5">especially we discover that one day</text>
  <text start="387.63" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s going to be a resurrection and</text>
  <text start="389.03" dur="4.03">our spirits and our souls they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="391.5" dur="5.28">just they don&amp;#39;t just float around as</text>
  <text start="393.06" dur="6.39">disembodied amoebas floating around in</text>
  <text start="396.78" dur="4.65">is heaven no we have a physical</text>
  <text start="399.45" dur="3.93">resurrection that&amp;#39;s our hope because</text>
  <text start="401.43" dur="3.09">Yahshua had a physical resurrection and</text>
  <text start="403.38" dur="2.67">we one day we&amp;#39;ll have a physical</text>
  <text start="404.52" dur="5.31">resurrection in which we will have new</text>
  <text start="406.05" dur="5.25">bodies created bodies new bodies much</text>
  <text start="409.83" dur="4.38">more better and wonderful than the ones</text>
  <text start="411.3" dur="5.22">we have now that will contain our</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="4.56">spirits our souls so even in the</text>
  <text start="416.52" dur="5.49">resurrection even an eternity the</text>
  <text start="418.77" dur="6.51">physical and spirit are still bound</text>
  <text start="422.01" dur="4.89">together well I say I use the term</text>
  <text start="425.28" dur="3.59">physical loosely it&amp;#39;s going to be some</text>
  <text start="426.9" dur="4.5">sort of body I don&amp;#39;t know what kind</text>
  <text start="428.87" dur="4.36">maybe more of an angelic body so maybe I</text>
  <text start="431.4" dur="3.24">shouldn&amp;#39;t use the term physical but in</text>
  <text start="433.23" dur="3.63">any case it&amp;#39;s not just going to be some</text>
  <text start="434.64" dur="5.94">disembodied spirit or soul that the</text>
  <text start="436.86" dur="6.03">Greeks often think about so the</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="5.07">encouragement from this very basic</text>
  <text start="442.89" dur="6">understanding is let us not like the</text>
  <text start="445.65" dur="6.269">Talmud asst and the Orthodox Jews reject</text>
  <text start="448.89" dur="4.88">the spiritual meat of yah as we lust for</text>
  <text start="451.919" dur="4.321">physical objects in the physical realm</text>
  <text start="453.77" dur="5.73">but let us not like the graeco-roman</text>
  <text start="456.24" dur="6.239">Christians and remember this</text>
  <text start="459.5" dur="5.19">Aristotelian platonic Grieco philosophy</text>
  <text start="462.479" dur="4.591">has permeated Christianity which is why</text>
  <text start="464.69" dur="4.03">so many Christians and so many</text>
  <text start="467.07" dur="3.54">denominations reject the physical</text>
  <text start="468.72" dur="5.85">aspects of Torah while I&amp;#39;m racing the</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="5.46">more spiritual aspects of Torah so let</text>
  <text start="474.57" dur="2.909">us not like the graeco-roman Christians</text>
  <text start="476.07" dur="3.81">reject the physical commandments of</text>
  <text start="477.479" dur="5.901">keeping to our a while thinking we can</text>
  <text start="479.88" dur="6.539">do only a spiritual obedience to yeah</text>
  <text start="483.38" dur="6.61">okay because I&amp;#39;ll tell you the act of</text>
  <text start="486.419" dur="6.031">prayer and the act of reading your Bible</text>
  <text start="489.99" dur="5.37">and talking to Yahweh is just as Holy as</text>
  <text start="492.45" dur="5.07">eating clean foods and wearing the seat</text>
  <text start="495.36" dur="3.63">seat and and keeping the Sabbath day and</text>
  <text start="497.52" dur="3.42">doing these things I mean they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="498.99" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re all intertwined and you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="500.94" dur="6.96">separate them so in short let us not</text>
  <text start="504.3" dur="5.94">separate the Torah from the Torah</text>
  <text start="507.9" dur="5.85">clothed in flesh Yahshua the Holy One of</text>
  <text start="510.24" dur="7.2">Israel let us not separate the physical</text>
  <text start="513.75" dur="5.76">from the spiritual because yah didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="517.44" dur="5.099">that yo created us from the dust of the</text>
  <text start="519.51" dur="4.5">earth and then he breathed upon that</text>
  <text start="522.539" dur="5.491">dust of the earth not only with the DOM</text>
  <text start="524.01" dur="5.34">and his wife eve haba but he breathed</text>
  <text start="528.03" dur="3.81">upon the</text>
  <text start="529.35" dur="7.17">apostles upon the disciples and he</text>
  <text start="531.84" dur="5.79">commissioned them so both of these</text>
  <text start="536.52" dur="2.28">things are very very important we need</text>
  <text start="537.63" dur="3.87">to remember the physical and the</text>
  <text start="538.8" dur="4.77">spiritual realm are both as important</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re both tied together we need not</text>
  <text start="543.57" dur="4.65">try to divide them or separate them our</text>
  <text start="545.91" dur="3.78">compartmentalize them in our lives but</text>
  <text start="548.22" dur="4.35">understand that both spiritual and</text>
  <text start="549.69" dur="5.45">physical realities are intertwined</text>
  <text start="552.57" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re there an organic whole and that</text>
  <text start="555.14" dur="5.32">is how the Scriptures portray them and</text>
  <text start="557.55" dur="6.57">that&amp;#39;s how we should approach life and</text>
  <text start="560.46" dur="6.42">that helps us to walk with no</text>
  <text start="564.12" dur="5.82">contradiction and to walk purely</text>
  <text start="566.88" dur="6.33">blamelessly and sincerely the way that</text>
  <text start="569.94" dur="4.8">the way that we should okay Yahweh bless</text>
  <text start="573.21" dur="5.37">Shalom have a great rest of your week</text>
