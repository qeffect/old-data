  <text start="12.12" dur="4.29">morning guys</text>
  <text start="13.62" dur="6.72">I&amp;#39;ll be having my Sabbath walk later</text>
  <text start="16.41" dur="6.949">today but I have a teaching I wanted to</text>
  <text start="20.34" dur="6.509">do this is from numbers chapter 2 and</text>
  <text start="23.359" dur="6.16">Genesis 48 and 49 it&amp;#39;s about the 12</text>
  <text start="26.849" dur="6.691">tribes of Israel and there&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="29.519" dur="6.841">prophetic significance now I want to</text>
  <text start="33.54" dur="5.31">make it clear at the outset that we</text>
  <text start="36.36" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t need to worry about which tribe or</text>
  <text start="38.85" dur="4.619">grafted into Yahshua the Messiah will</text>
  <text start="40.86" dur="5.129">sort that out when we get resurrected on</text>
  <text start="43.469" dur="4.051">that seventh trumpet resurrection what</text>
  <text start="45.989" dur="3.151">the Christians called the rapture from</text>
  <text start="47.52" dur="3.359">that seventh trumpet resurrection on</text>
  <text start="49.14" dur="3.27">some future yom teruah or piece of</text>
  <text start="50.879" dur="3.421">trumpets we&amp;#39;ll be caught up to be with</text>
  <text start="52.41" dur="3.12">him in a sky and all the dead Messiah</text>
  <text start="54.3" dur="3.029">and those who are alive and remain will</text>
  <text start="55.53" dur="4.709">be caught and be with him and he&amp;#39;ll sort</text>
  <text start="57.329" dur="3.541">us out as to which tribe were in but but</text>
  <text start="60.239" dur="2.521">there&amp;#39;s some really interesting</text>
  <text start="60.87" dur="3.179">information about these 12 tribes and</text>
  <text start="62.76" dur="3.75">how they were set up and I want it</text>
  <text start="64.049" dur="5.341">I just felt moved to share this with</text>
  <text start="66.51" dur="6.45">everybody and hopefully it will it will</text>
  <text start="69.39" dur="6.06">bless you so in numbers chapter 2 we see</text>
  <text start="72.96" dur="4.049">the setup and just so you guys know the</text>
  <text start="75.45" dur="8.22">directions I&amp;#39;m going to do you know</text>
  <text start="77.009" dur="9.421">north up here west east and south that</text>
  <text start="83.67" dur="6.15">will be my compass there so west north</text>
  <text start="86.43" dur="6.18">east and south and remember yah said</text>
  <text start="89.82" dur="4.53">that promotion comes neither from the</text>
  <text start="92.61" dur="4.71">East nor the West nor from the south or</text>
  <text start="94.35" dur="4.64">from well the north side and he&amp;#39;s on the</text>
  <text start="97.32" dur="5.04">side of the north so remember that</text>
  <text start="98.99" dur="4.93">remember that Yahshua said as lightning</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="4.02">comes from the east to the west so shall</text>
  <text start="103.92" dur="5.46">the Son of Man come so he&amp;#39;s gonna burst</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="5.19">from the eastern sky with all of us</text>
  <text start="109.38" dur="4.199">resurrected Saints behind him on</text>
  <text start="111.57" dur="4.25">Revelation 19 so remember those two</text>
  <text start="113.579" dur="8.521">types of concepts as I go through this</text>
  <text start="115.82" dur="9.61">okay so we have the tabernacle of Moses</text>
  <text start="122.1" dur="6.87">in the center of the camp and this is</text>
  <text start="125.43" dur="5.279">why while they are traveling eastward</text>
  <text start="128.97" dur="2.52">toward the promised land from Egypt</text>
  <text start="130.709" dur="2.461">right</text>
  <text start="131.49" dur="3.89">so this is the tabernacle of Moses right</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="4.83">here it&amp;#39;s in the very very center and</text>
  <text start="135.38" dur="4.57">the first camp that they listed there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s four camps and each of these</text>
  <text start="139.95" dur="4.59">camps have three tribes in it which by</text>
  <text start="141.96" dur="4.53">the way is based off there&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="144.54" dur="3.75">four walls for the New Jerusalem and</text>
  <text start="146.49" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s three gates made of one Perot</text>
  <text start="148.29" dur="3.69">and each one corresponds to one of the</text>
  <text start="150.45" dur="4.17">tribes of Israel and also one of the</text>
  <text start="151.98" dur="5.61">Twelve Apostles but this is kind of the</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="4.32">original setup here so we first have the</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="3.45">camp of Judah</text>
  <text start="158.94" dur="4.41">now remember Judah was the fourth born</text>
  <text start="161.04" dur="5.25">he was the fourth born and yet he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="163.35" dur="6.42">one that&amp;#39;s listed first because Joshua</text>
  <text start="166.29" dur="6.57">Jesus the Messiah comes from Judah lujah</text>
  <text start="169.77" dur="6.12">Jude is the lawgiver so Judah is list</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="5">the camp of Judah is listed first and in</text>
  <text start="175.89" dur="6">the camp of Judah we have of course</text>
  <text start="177.86" dur="6.54">remember there&amp;#39;s twelve tribes the very</text>
  <text start="181.89" dur="4.53">first one they list of course is Judah</text>
  <text start="184.4" dur="5.71">these would be what we would call the</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="7.02">Jews Judah Yahshua Jesus came from the</text>
  <text start="190.11" dur="5.31">tribe of Judah as did Judas Iscariot by</text>
  <text start="193.44" dur="3.86">the way if you haven&amp;#39;t seen my teaching</text>
  <text start="195.42" dur="6.39">the real son of perdition go watch that</text>
  <text start="197.3" dur="7.26">alright so in Judah they have a total</text>
  <text start="201.81" dur="5.43">seventy four thousand six hundred</text>
  <text start="204.56" dur="4.06">fighting men there in Judah of course</text>
  <text start="207.24" dur="5.01">not counting women and children just the</text>
  <text start="208.62" dur="4.92">the men 20 and over and there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="212.25" dur="3.3">actually they&amp;#39;re on the east side and</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="4.68">memory Yahshua said he would come from</text>
  <text start="215.55" dur="4.86">the east again he&amp;#39;s the fourth born but</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="5.52">he&amp;#39;s listed first the very first tribe</text>
  <text start="220.41" dur="9.39">listed then they list</text>
  <text start="223.74" dur="9.69">Zebulon right next to Judah and Zebulun</text>
  <text start="229.8" dur="6.84">are sea dwellers you can read about this</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="5.94">in Genesis when Yaakov when Israel</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="4.53">blesses his sons but they&amp;#39;re moved by</text>
  <text start="239.37" dur="4.38">the Haven see their sea dwellers Haven</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="5.54">at the sea and then next to them is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.75" dur="9.66">a car nowadays a car is real interesting</text>
  <text start="246.71" dur="8.35">because if you go to where&amp;#39;s my Bible if</text>
  <text start="253.41" dur="6.63">you go to first Chronicles</text>
  <text start="255.06" dur="5.929">I think it&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re going to use my Bible</text>
  <text start="260.04" dur="3.83">I just had it</text>
  <text start="260.989" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;ll here&amp;#39;s you got it first Chronicles</text>
  <text start="263.87" dur="10.139">I&amp;#39;m gonna see if I can find it here</text>
  <text start="265.729" dur="10.861">I think it&amp;#39;s 12:30 - yeah first</text>
  <text start="274.009" dur="4.351">chronicles 12:32 it says and the</text>
  <text start="276.59" dur="4.02">children of this a car which were men</text>
  <text start="278.36" dur="5.279">that had understanding of the times to</text>
  <text start="280.61" dur="5.52">know what Israel ought to do so these</text>
  <text start="283.639" dur="4.051">were sort of the prophets they they</text>
  <text start="286.13" dur="4.59">understood the times they could advise</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="5.16">are also kind of a prophetic tribe here</text>
  <text start="290.72" dur="4.74">so the prophets so look at this you</text>
  <text start="292.85" dur="4.409">gotta do that the prophets and those</text>
  <text start="295.46" dur="3.36">that dwell by the sea all in one camp</text>
  <text start="297.259" dur="6.481">and they&amp;#39;re all oh I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="298.82" dur="6.96">and it&amp;#39;s a car has all the way I comes</text>
  <text start="303.74" dur="4.649">giving here so Zebulon sorry the sea</text>
  <text start="305.78" dur="6.03">dwellers have fifty seven thousand four</text>
  <text start="308.389" dur="6.511">hundred men twenty over and it&amp;#39;s a car</text>
  <text start="311.81" dur="7.77">has fifty four thousand four hundred men</text>
  <text start="314.9" dur="6.75">total okay so the sea dwellers the tribe</text>
  <text start="319.58" dur="3.45">that Yahshua came from and the prophets</text>
  <text start="321.65" dur="5.489">they&amp;#39;re all on the east side memory</text>
  <text start="323.03" dur="6.48">Yahshua will come from the east he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="327.139" dur="4.02">burst from the eastern sky so this is</text>
  <text start="329.51" dur="6.32">all considered this whole thing right</text>
  <text start="331.159" dur="4.671">here is considered the camp of Judah and</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="4.27">it says their total amount is one</text>
  <text start="339.02" dur="3.84">hundred eighty six thousand four hundred</text>
  <text start="340.55" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re the biggest camp of all the four</text>
  <text start="342.86" dur="4.08">camps I&amp;#39;m gonna go over this is the</text>
  <text start="343.82" dur="5.25">biggest one and they&amp;#39;re the ones that go</text>
  <text start="346.94" dur="3.84">first they&amp;#39;re the first rank so they</text>
  <text start="349.07" dur="3.75">they they would leave as they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="350.78" dur="5.49">eastward toward the promised land</text>
  <text start="352.82" dur="5.46">from Egypt they would lead so this is</text>
  <text start="356.27" dur="4.739">the first ring so anyway I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.28" dur="6.359">really interesting okay so now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="361.009" dur="5.761">basically going clockwise as Yad</text>
  <text start="364.639" dur="4.801">describes us we&amp;#39;re going clockwise this</text>
  <text start="366.77" dur="5.639">time goes forward but one clockwise okay</text>
  <text start="369.44" dur="7.409">so now the next one they list is Reuben</text>
  <text start="372.409" dur="6">and it he&amp;#39;s on the South now again</text>
  <text start="376.849" dur="5.401">promotion comes from the north so the</text>
  <text start="378.409" dur="5.82">offices of south and Reuben is is he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.25" dur="5.55">the firstborn but if you read in Genesis</text>
  <text start="384.229" dur="6.211">he kind of gets a curse if you go to</text>
  <text start="387.8" dur="3.83">Genesis where Jacob or Israel as we</text>
  <text start="390.44" dur="3.71">should call him his name</text>
  <text start="391.63" dur="4.95">changed Israel as he overcame but as</text>
  <text start="394.15" dur="6.63">Israel was blessing his children Reuben</text>
  <text start="396.58" dur="14.46">is the firstborn but but he&amp;#39;s unstable</text>
  <text start="400.78" dur="13.5">as water again is this from Genesis 48</text>
  <text start="411.04" dur="4.62">and 49 you want to get look this up and</text>
  <text start="414.28" dur="3.18">the numbers chapter 2 we weren&amp;#39;t getting</text>
  <text start="415.66" dur="5.76">this order to tribe them</text>
  <text start="417.46" dur="5.85">so it says yeah Reuben you were my first</text>
  <text start="421.42" dur="3.57">born my might in the beginning of my</text>
  <text start="423.31" dur="3.06">strength the excellency of dignity in</text>
  <text start="424.99" dur="2.7">the excellency of power but you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="426.37" dur="3.75">unstable as water</text>
  <text start="427.69" dur="4.37">you shall not excel because you went up</text>
  <text start="430.12" dur="5.25">to your father&amp;#39;s bed and you defiled it</text>
  <text start="432.06" dur="8.47">he went up to my couch so he won&amp;#39;t Excel</text>
  <text start="435.37" dur="6.45">not Excel so he kind of curse so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.53" dur="3.21">kind of interesting because it&amp;#39;s on the</text>
  <text start="441.82" dur="3.3">south now eventually Reuben will be</text>
  <text start="443.74" dur="2.61">redeemed just like all these twelve</text>
  <text start="445.12" dur="3.45">tribes will I want to make that clear</text>
  <text start="446.35" dur="3.72">and he does have excellency of strength</text>
  <text start="448.57" dur="6.21">and everything but but he&amp;#39;s unstable</text>
  <text start="450.07" dur="12.66">he&amp;#39;s unstable he won&amp;#39;t Excel and so</text>
  <text start="454.78" dur="9.84">Reuben his tribe is 46,500 okay so quite</text>
  <text start="462.73" dur="6.39">a bit smaller than the fourth one in</text>
  <text start="464.62" dur="8.67">Judah hallelujah okay and then with</text>
  <text start="469.12" dur="9.66">Reuben we also have GAD is listed with</text>
  <text start="473.29" dur="9.54">Reuben never at a room here dad and GAD</text>
  <text start="478.78" dur="8.16">has forty five thousand six hundred and</text>
  <text start="482.83" dur="6.27">fifty men and GAD is interesting it says</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="3.87">there they&amp;#39;re initially overcome so it</text>
  <text start="489.1" dur="4.2">sounds bad with them they overcome at</text>
  <text start="490.81" dur="6.57">the last so they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re overcome but</text>
  <text start="493.3" dur="6">then they become overcomers so that</text>
  <text start="497.38" dur="5.73">might be a prophetic thing about about</text>
  <text start="499.3" dur="6.33">the children of GAD and then along with</text>
  <text start="503.11" dur="6.75">Reuben is listed Simeon who also kind of</text>
  <text start="505.63" dur="8.339">receives a curse as well Simeon s fifty</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="6.84">nine thousand three hundred so pretty</text>
  <text start="513.969" dur="3.811">big but Simeon and Levi were both kind</text>
  <text start="516.7" dur="2.7">of got cursed</text>
  <text start="517.78" dur="3.7">it says soon and leave our brethren</text>
  <text start="519.4" dur="4.66">instruments of cruelty are they</text>
  <text start="521.48" dur="4.65">avocations oh my soul come out now into</text>
  <text start="524.06" dur="3.93">their secret under their assembly mine</text>
  <text start="526.13" dur="3.54">honor be not thou united for in their</text>
  <text start="527.99" dur="4.05">anger they slew a man and their self</text>
  <text start="529.67" dur="4.23">will they dig down a wall cursed be</text>
  <text start="532.04" dur="4.29">their anger for disputes and their wrath</text>
  <text start="533.9" dur="5.58">it was cruel I will divide them in Jacob</text>
  <text start="536.33" dur="4.49">and scatter them in Israel so and then</text>
  <text start="539.48" dur="3.62">they were they&amp;#39;re not even in the same</text>
  <text start="540.82" dur="5.59">Simeon and Levi are not even the same</text>
  <text start="543.1" dur="6.04">tribes in the same Concannon&amp;#39;s but you</text>
  <text start="546.41" dur="5.94">know sitting in Levi they they took</text>
  <text start="549.14" dur="4.77">vengeance on their sister Dinah even</text>
  <text start="552.35" dur="2.97">though this man was honourable in</text>
  <text start="553.91" dur="4.53">wanting to marry Dinah and they wanted</text>
  <text start="555.32" dur="4.53">to be you know grafted into Israel semen</text>
  <text start="558.44" dur="2.91">in Levi you can read about the</text>
  <text start="559.85" dur="3.81">scriptures they took matters in their</text>
  <text start="561.35" dur="3.87">own hands and they wind up murdering a</text>
  <text start="563.66" dur="3.66">bunch of men and Jacob had to leave</text>
  <text start="565.22" dur="3.72">anyway so they got a curse for that so</text>
  <text start="567.32" dur="3.68">Simeon got cursed for that being an</text>
  <text start="568.94" dur="9.18">instrument of cruelty Simeon and and</text>
  <text start="571" dur="9.16">Levi instruments of cruelty okay so this</text>
  <text start="578.12" dur="4.29">whole thing here is considered the camp</text>
  <text start="580.16" dur="6.66">of Reuben and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="582.41" dur="6.63">second-ranked which means these guys</text>
  <text start="586.82" dur="2.97">have them first then these guys are the</text>
  <text start="589.04" dur="4.86">south of MU</text>
  <text start="589.79" dur="5.4">okay and then it takes a break for all</text>
  <text start="593.9" dur="3.57">these two cans and it talks about the</text>
  <text start="595.19" dur="3.99">the tribe of Levi which surrounds the</text>
  <text start="597.47" dur="4.02">tabernacle because they were they were</text>
  <text start="599.18" dur="3.84">the priests right there were the priests</text>
  <text start="601.49" dur="3.21">appointed free so even though they got</text>
  <text start="603.02" dur="3.93">cursed look they got they got to be</text>
  <text start="604.7" dur="4.35">priests to minister to the temple</text>
  <text start="606.95" dur="4.5">so again Yahoo&amp;#39;s always in the act of</text>
  <text start="609.05" dur="4.83">redeeming these tribes he always wants</text>
  <text start="611.45" dur="6.63">to redeem mankind and that says that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="613.88" dur="8.28">his preference so so Levi is not counted</text>
  <text start="618.08" dur="6.45">it&amp;#39;s uncountable yah specifically says</text>
  <text start="622.16" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t take a tally of these guys which i</text>
  <text start="624.53" dur="2.55">think is interesting because in</text>
  <text start="625.49" dur="4.85">Revelation 1 it says that we are a</text>
  <text start="627.08" dur="4.98">nation of kings and priests you know</text>
  <text start="630.34" dur="4">uncountable so maybe this was a</text>
  <text start="632.06" dur="4.2">foreshadow of yet countable nation of</text>
  <text start="634.34" dur="3.12">kings of priests but Levi is not to be</text>
  <text start="636.26" dur="2.85">counted so we don&amp;#39;t know what the</text>
  <text start="637.46" dur="3.6">population of Levi was but they</text>
  <text start="639.11" dur="4.2">literally surrounded the tabernacle</text>
  <text start="641.06" dur="5.58">right all around as they did the</text>
  <text start="643.31" dur="5.04">ministry of the tabernacle so this guy</text>
  <text start="646.64" dur="3.39">would be first rank the camp of Judah</text>
  <text start="648.35" dur="3.3">then the camp of Reuben would be second</text>
  <text start="650.03" dur="2.42">rank and then the Levites would start</text>
  <text start="651.65" dur="2.95">moving with</text>
  <text start="652.45" dur="4.65">and the town Apple would move as well</text>
  <text start="654.6" dur="5.049">and of course the pillar of fire and</text>
  <text start="657.1" dur="4.65">smoke was always on the Tabernacle fire</text>
  <text start="659.649" dur="7.411">by night smoke by day to show them where</text>
  <text start="661.75" dur="10.47">to go okay so the total amount of Rubin</text>
  <text start="667.06" dur="9.26">the camp of Rubin is a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="672.22" dur="7.14">one thousand and four hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="676.32" dur="6.069">so pretty big but not as big as the camp</text>
  <text start="679.36" dur="4.32">of Judah Judah is 186,000 hundred this</text>
  <text start="682.389" dur="3.991">was one hundred fifty one thousand for</text>
  <text start="683.68" dur="7.769">150 so the biggest is here and this is</text>
  <text start="686.38" dur="6.99">the this is what we&amp;#39;ll figure out the</text>
  <text start="691.449" dur="3.69">when I do the other portables figure it</text>
  <text start="693.37" dur="3.3">out okay so now we&amp;#39;re going to go to the</text>
  <text start="695.139" dur="3.661">west side so now go to the west side and</text>
  <text start="696.67" dur="6.24">this is ephraim known as the camp of</text>
  <text start="698.8" dur="6.39">ephraim and remember Ephraim and</text>
  <text start="702.91" dur="4.109">Manasseh were the two sons of Joseph van</text>
  <text start="705.19" dur="4.829">Ephraim was the younger Manasseh was the</text>
  <text start="707.019" dur="5.401">older but if you agree to genesis i</text>
  <text start="710.019" dur="3.841">think it&amp;#39;s 48 you&amp;#39;ll see that even</text>
  <text start="712.42" dur="2.76">though Jada was supposed to bless the</text>
  <text start="713.86" dur="3.719">old or Manasseh with the greater</text>
  <text start="715.18" dur="3.96">blessing that&amp;#39;s the custom he switched</text>
  <text start="717.579" dur="2.491">his hand so the first Joseph was like</text>
  <text start="719.14" dur="3.66">what are you doing father</text>
  <text start="720.07" dur="4.949">and and and Jacob said don&amp;#39;t worry I</text>
  <text start="722.8" dur="3.39">know what I&amp;#39;m doing so after he even</text>
  <text start="725.019" dur="2.581">though he was the younger he got the</text>
  <text start="726.19" dur="4.53">greater blessing he said he&amp;#39;d become a</text>
  <text start="727.6" dur="5.099">great nation and many nations many</text>
  <text start="730.72" dur="3.359">nations would come out of him so</text>
  <text start="732.699" dur="5.671">everyone was going to be extremely</text>
  <text start="734.079" dur="6.091">populated Africans at that point was</text>
  <text start="738.37" dur="3.48">only forty thousand five hundred so</text>
  <text start="740.17" dur="3.57">still you know not as big as some of</text>
  <text start="741.85" dur="3.12">these tribes but everyone was forty</text>
  <text start="743.74" dur="4.76">thousand five hundred and it was</text>
  <text start="744.97" dur="13.08">prophesied and I&amp;#39;ll just read it here</text>
  <text start="748.5" dur="10.959">that many nations would come yeah after</text>
  <text start="758.05" dur="3.599">his younger brother shall be greater</text>
  <text start="759.459" dur="5.481">than the nasa his older brother and his</text>
  <text start="761.649" dur="7.201">seed shall become a multitude of Nations</text>
  <text start="764.94" dur="5.769">and Vanessa will also become a people</text>
  <text start="768.85" dur="3.929">and be great but ephraim will become a</text>
  <text start="770.709" dur="3.93">multitude of nations so multitude of</text>
  <text start="772.779" dur="3.691">nations is Ephraim and then of course</text>
  <text start="774.639" dur="7.591">listed with a friend is his brother</text>
  <text start="776.47" dur="7.109">Manasseh who also becomes great but not</text>
  <text start="782.23" dur="2.7">as great as his younger brother and</text>
  <text start="783.579" dur="3.661">Manasseh</text>
  <text start="784.93" dur="4.469">thirty two thousand two hundred so even</text>
  <text start="787.24" dur="4.08">here this early on you already see the</text>
  <text start="789.399" dur="5.821">vanassa&amp;#39;s smaller than ephraim just like</text>
  <text start="791.32" dur="8.79">jacob prophesied hundreds of years</text>
  <text start="795.22" dur="8.1">before hallelujah and then listen quick</text>
  <text start="800.11" dur="6.99">both of these is Benjamin Benjamin is</text>
  <text start="803.32" dur="6.78">known as the tribe of the wolf Benjamin</text>
  <text start="807.1" dur="8.359">has thirty five thousand four hundred</text>
  <text start="810.1" dur="9.12">men it&amp;#39;s a pretty small tribe but</text>
  <text start="815.459" dur="5.771">Benjamin&amp;#39;s promises subshell ravine as a</text>
  <text start="819.22" dur="3.42">wolf in the morning he shall devour the</text>
  <text start="821.23" dur="5.96">prey and at night he shall divide the</text>
  <text start="822.64" dur="7.38">spoil so they&amp;#39;re wolves they&amp;#39;re warriors</text>
  <text start="827.19" dur="4.33">and remember later in history Benjamin</text>
  <text start="830.02" dur="5.31">that tribe benjin almost became</text>
  <text start="831.52" dur="7.83">completely decimated because they they</text>
  <text start="835.33" dur="7.23">did a horrible thing in raping a Levite</text>
  <text start="839.35" dur="5.64">daughter a lot of homosexuality had</text>
  <text start="842.56" dur="5.07">gotten into this tribe as well and just</text>
  <text start="844.99" dur="4.83">brute brutality sexual perversion and so</text>
  <text start="847.63" dur="3.93">all the other tribes attack Benjamin and</text>
  <text start="849.82" dur="3.93">Benjamin almost got reduced to nothing</text>
  <text start="851.56" dur="4.23">they almost got wiped off the face of</text>
  <text start="853.75" dur="4.589">the earth and then you know they were</text>
  <text start="855.79" dur="7.049">tented and they saw they repopulated and</text>
  <text start="858.339" dur="6.201">built back up and then in that so that</text>
  <text start="862.839" dur="5.221">so this is known as the tribe of Ephraim</text>
  <text start="864.54" dur="7.87">right here and their total is a hundred</text>
  <text start="868.06" dur="7.14">eight thousand one hundred so quite a</text>
  <text start="872.41" dur="4.41">bit smaller than me this is 186,000 as</text>
  <text start="875.2" dur="3.63">an orphan without this tribe is quite a</text>
  <text start="876.82" dur="6.57">bit smaller and they&amp;#39;re on the west so</text>
  <text start="878.83" dur="7.52">they&amp;#39;re coming sort of from behind and</text>
  <text start="883.39" dur="6.36">then and we got the sides of the north</text>
  <text start="886.35" dur="5.14">I&amp;#39;m gonna have to I&amp;#39;m gonna have to</text>
  <text start="889.75" dur="6.3">erase my compass here so I can do the</text>
  <text start="891.49" dur="8.94">suck sides of the North where&amp;#39;s my sorry</text>
  <text start="896.05" dur="9.72">guys I should have been more so the size</text>
  <text start="900.43" dur="6.719">of the north and even though promotion</text>
  <text start="905.77" dur="5.73">comes from the size of the north</text>
  <text start="907.149" dur="8.251">they&amp;#39;re the last ones to go in terms of</text>
  <text start="911.5" dur="5.91">the marching order so first rank second</text>
  <text start="915.4" dur="2.16">rank the Levites would then move with</text>
  <text start="917.41" dur="2.369">the</text>
  <text start="917.56" dur="4.59">carnival third-ranked fall behind and</text>
  <text start="919.779" dur="6.411">then these guys have come so the first</text>
  <text start="922.15" dur="6.84">shall be last the last will be first so</text>
  <text start="926.19" dur="4.839">this is known as the tribe we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="928.99" dur="5.07">update dance so got the camp of Judah</text>
  <text start="931.029" dur="4.831">the camp of Reuben the camp of Ephraim</text>
  <text start="934.06" dur="7.74">and now we have the camp of Dan so Dan</text>
  <text start="935.86" dur="7.95">is listed first and they have a really</text>
  <text start="941.8" dur="5.13">big one at sixty two thousand seven</text>
  <text start="943.81" dur="5.25">hundred it&amp;#39;s almost the biggest try it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="946.93" dur="4.11">not as big as Judah Jews the the biggest</text>
  <text start="949.06" dur="4.77">one but it&amp;#39;s the second biggest tribe</text>
  <text start="951.04" dur="5.61">and Dan has an interesting prophecy it</text>
  <text start="953.83" dur="8.009">says they&amp;#39;ll little judge will be judges</text>
  <text start="956.65" dur="7.29">of judges people he&amp;#39;ll be a serpent by</text>
  <text start="961.839" dur="3.721">the way and adder in the path a vial of</text>
  <text start="963.94" dur="3.93">horses heels so that his rider shall</text>
  <text start="965.56" dur="5.37">fall backward I have waited for your</text>
  <text start="967.87" dur="5.88">salvation so judgment and salvation of</text>
  <text start="970.93" dur="5.7">the tribe of Dan now Dan this tribe got</text>
  <text start="973.75" dur="5.91">completely removed because they got into</text>
  <text start="976.63" dur="4.17">apostasy early on and they started</text>
  <text start="979.66" dur="2.79">making up their own thing rather than</text>
  <text start="980.8" dur="4.289">following the Levites and so this this</text>
  <text start="982.45" dur="4.889">tribe got completely removed but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="985.089" dur="4.441">interesting is you keep reading in the</text>
  <text start="987.339" dur="4.201">prophets when you get to the new heavens</text>
  <text start="989.53" dur="5.22">new earth Dan is completely restored</text>
  <text start="991.54" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s back so that&amp;#39;s kind of cool it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="994.75" dur="3.96">not mentioned in the 144,000 because</text>
  <text start="997.27" dur="3.09">that&amp;#39;s during the Great Tribulation and</text>
  <text start="998.71" dur="2.67">Dan still not been restored but when we</text>
  <text start="1000.36" dur="2.58">get to the new heavens and new earth</text>
  <text start="1001.38" dur="4.44">when we get to that big the Millennial</text>
  <text start="1002.94" dur="7.62">Kingdom as well Dan is restored but</text>
  <text start="1005.82" dur="12.18">their judges and salvation oh yeah</text>
  <text start="1010.56" dur="8.54">and then list it with Dan is Naphtali so</text>
  <text start="1018" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;m running out of room here</text>
  <text start="1019.1" dur="8.38">natalie has fifty three thousand four</text>
  <text start="1023.31" dur="6.09">hundred and Naphtali is a high let loose</text>
  <text start="1027.48" dur="7.07">they give goodly words so they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="1029.4" dur="7.559">the poets and the writers goodly words</text>
  <text start="1034.55" dur="8.35">that&amp;#39;s Natalie and then listen which</text>
  <text start="1036.959" dur="9.261">also then is Asher and Asher is forty</text>
  <text start="1042.9" dur="5.88">one thousand five hundred and these guys</text>
  <text start="1046.22" dur="3.43">the ashes real interesting too there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1048.78" dur="3.93">sort of the the</text>
  <text start="1049.65" dur="4.62">food makers it says out of a sure his</text>
  <text start="1052.71" dur="3.96">bread shall be fat and he shall yield</text>
  <text start="1054.27" dur="7.74">royal babies so they&amp;#39;re the bakers and</text>
  <text start="1056.67" dur="6.96">the food makers so this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="1062.01" dur="3.3">considered the tribe of Dan they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="1063.63" dur="5.49">really big there are a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="1065.31" dur="6.42">seven thousand six hundred is that is</text>
  <text start="1069.12" dur="5.49">the camp of dan dan so they they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1071.73" dur="3.48">as big as Judah but they&amp;#39;re bigger than</text>
  <text start="1074.61" dur="2.25">Reuben</text>
  <text start="1075.21" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re obviously bigger than the tribe</text>
  <text start="1076.86" dur="4.26">of Ephraim so there&amp;#39;s a second biggest</text>
  <text start="1078.48" dur="7.29">right here so that&amp;#39;s I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1081.12" dur="6">interesting as well so so anyway so I</text>
  <text start="1085.77" dur="4.11">think all these have prophetic</text>
  <text start="1087.12" dur="4.17">significance in the end times and even</text>
  <text start="1089.88" dur="2.76">beyond the Great Tribulation when you</text>
  <text start="1091.29" dur="3.06">get into the Millennial Kingdom the</text>
  <text start="1092.64" dur="3.75">Thousand Year reign of Messiah and also</text>
  <text start="1094.35" dur="3.75">the new heavens new earth beyond that I</text>
  <text start="1096.39" dur="4.32">think this all has a lot of significance</text>
  <text start="1098.1" dur="4.92">but I wanted to do this sorry I got so</text>
  <text start="1100.71" dur="4.02">messy up here but just to summarize you</text>
  <text start="1103.02" dur="2.94">got the camp of Judah on the east of</text>
  <text start="1104.73" dur="2.94">course the Oscars gonna come from the</text>
  <text start="1105.96" dur="3.45">east they&amp;#39;re the first rank</text>

  <text start="1109.41" dur="3.09">children of Israel along</text>
  <text start="1111.03" dur="2.82">Zebulon and this is part of the prophets</text>
  <text start="1112.5" dur="4.35">and the sea dwellers were with them and</text>
  <text start="1113.85" dur="5.73">then you got Reuben okay</text>
  <text start="1116.85" dur="4.83">he kind of was cursed Simeon was cursed</text>
  <text start="1119.58" dur="3.57">to God has originally overcome but they</text>
  <text start="1121.68" dur="2.22">eventually become overcomers and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1123.15" dur="2.88">on the south</text>
  <text start="1123.9" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re on the south and the second ring</text>
  <text start="1126.03" dur="5.37">and then you got the tribe of Ephraim</text>
  <text start="1128.58" dur="4.53">and Manasseh and Benjamin of course</text>

  <text start="1133.11" dur="2.79">Ephraim becomes a tri a seed of many</text>
  <text start="1135.42" dur="2.13">nations</text>
  <text start="1135.9" dur="4.14">Manasseh is also great but not as big as</text>
  <text start="1137.55" dur="4.17">his brother and Benjamin is the wolves</text>
  <text start="1140.04" dur="2.9">and the Warriors and they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="1141.72" dur="5.61">third-ranked</text>
