  <text start="97.15" dur="6.829">background of what what kind of</text>
  <text start="100.03" dur="7.199">information and Walden regarding this</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="7.93">okay well my name is Holly I live in the</text>
  <text start="107.229" dur="6.661">beautiful state of Florida and I had I</text>

  <text start="118.24" dur="6.12">away I need to find a good attorney and</text>
  <text start="120.9" dur="8.109">and through my research I had got</text>
  <text start="124.36" dur="6.179">connected with a friend that has been</text>
  <text start="129.009" dur="3.811">working with Trump at Department of</text>
  <text start="130.539" dur="4.681">Justice and</text>
  <text start="132.82" dur="5.1">has been helping me and educating me and</text>
  <text start="135.22" dur="5.01">I&amp;#39;ve come to realize that the amount of</text>
  <text start="137.92" dur="5.42">corruption that is rampant in our</text>
  <text start="140.23" dur="6.81">country that has been secretly</text>
  <text start="143.34" dur="5.86">overstretching its power and basically</text>
  <text start="147.04" dur="5.1">it is about it&amp;#39;s their felonies there</text>
  <text start="149.2" dur="5.85">are infringing on American people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.14" dur="5.85">constitutional rights which is of the</text>
  <text start="155.05" dur="5.34">supreme law of the land and so because</text>
  <text start="157.99" dur="4.71">of that I have learned of a lot of the</text>
  <text start="160.39" dur="5.88">different tactics that they try to use</text>
  <text start="162.7" dur="6.509">to give people are lots of parents to</text>
  <text start="166.27" dur="5.49">submit out of fear and then unlawfully</text>
  <text start="169.209" dur="4.5">take their children so then they get put</text>
  <text start="171.76" dur="4.83">into foster homes a lot of times as</text>
  <text start="173.709" dur="5.101">parents then lose their children because</text>
  <text start="176.59" dur="6.08">they move them around and then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="178.81" dur="6.09">just unaccounted for very good okay</text>
  <text start="182.67" dur="5.5">introduce yourself and give us some of</text>
  <text start="184.9" dur="8.76">your backgrounds okay so yes my name is</text>
  <text start="188.17" dur="11.91">David Jose I been fighting since 2017 I</text>
  <text start="193.66" dur="10.25">had the unfortunate problem of having to</text>
  <text start="200.08" dur="7.14">fight CPS myself I realized quickly that</text>
  <text start="203.91" dur="5.97">this system looked nothing like anything</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="7.739">in a constitutional republic the courts</text>
  <text start="209.88" dur="9.76">allowed lying the courts hid evidence so</text>
  <text start="214.959" dur="7.711">I started to look at all of the systems</text>
  <text start="219.64" dur="4.89">and try to break down what it was that</text>
  <text start="222.67" dur="5.46">was happening and and I started looking</text>
  <text start="224.53" dur="6.929">and doing research to find the source of</text>
  <text start="228.13" dur="6.3">this system and in doing that in my</text>
  <text start="231.459" dur="4.291">battle with my little uns I started to</text>
  <text start="234.43" dur="3.119">figure out what was going on and go on</text>
  <text start="235.75" dur="4.079">but it kind of got to the end of the</text>
  <text start="237.549" dur="3.991">case so I found out a ton of this</text>
  <text start="239.829" dur="4.321">information that&amp;#39;s been helping other</text>
  <text start="241.54" dur="5.699">people after my case was pretty much</text>
  <text start="244.15" dur="9.36">done and I was in the Supreme Court of</text>
  <text start="247.239" dur="8.791">Arizona at the same time after doing the</text>
  <text start="253.51" dur="7.099">research I started to find that the very</text>
  <text start="256.03" dur="7.65">laws that people told us contained</text>
  <text start="260.609" dur="4.751">information that said that CPS could</text>
  <text start="263.68" dur="7.049">take his I actually found that</text>
  <text start="265.36" dur="8.309">the exact opposite so since I found the</text>
  <text start="270.729" dur="5.641">information I&amp;#39;ve been able to show other</text>
  <text start="273.669" dur="4.291">people what was really there we&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="276.37" dur="5.46">affidavits and different things of that</text>
  <text start="277.96" dur="8.31">nature and as of now we have somewhere</text>
  <text start="281.83" dur="6.989">between 23 24 and 30 kids that have been</text>
  <text start="286.27" dur="7.139">returned in the in in America and then</text>
  <text start="288.819" dur="8.37">in one in England that is really really</text>
  <text start="293.409" dur="6.57">good okay so before we get into the nuts</text>
  <text start="297.189" dur="4.95">and bolts of what parents can do David I</text>
  <text start="299.979" dur="3.93">want you to just explain what happened</text>
  <text start="302.139" dur="5.611">down in Arizona what were you able to do</text>
  <text start="303.909" dur="7.921">at that of that trafficking Council well</text>
  <text start="307.75" dur="8.099">it was really deep because I started</text>
  <text start="311.83" dur="7.47">giving private communication to the</text>
  <text start="315.849" dur="5.82">Supreme Court Justice of Arizona in a</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="5.82">meeting a few weeks before he actually</text>
  <text start="321.669" dur="5.4">came out and told that CPS wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="5.009">judiciary issue we went to a judiciary</text>
  <text start="327.069" dur="6.121">committee meeting I proved by trust</text>
  <text start="330.129" dur="7.41">indenture that there was no place for</text>
  <text start="333.19" dur="8.219">the judges of Arizona to be able to be</text>
  <text start="337.539" dur="6.06">paid in courts by CPS where they are at</text>
  <text start="341.409" dur="4.23">the same time under trust a denture by</text>
  <text start="343.599" dur="3.72">the people so when you look at any</text>
  <text start="345.639" dur="3.511">declaration of rights or Bill of Rights</text>
  <text start="347.319" dur="3.871">in the whole country you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="349.15" dur="3.389">find it as a trust indenture now most</text>
  <text start="351.19" dur="5.339">people won&amp;#39;t believe that but if you</text>
  <text start="352.539" dur="5.791">look at 1877 Georgia Constitution as</text>
  <text start="356.529" dur="3.781">ratified without subsequent amendments</text>
  <text start="358.33" dur="5.07">is going to tell you that the public</text>
  <text start="360.31" dur="6.539">servants are the trustees of the people</text>
  <text start="363.4" dur="6.81">so once you understand that in a trust</text>
  <text start="366.849" dur="6.66">agreement whatever power you give to the</text>
  <text start="370.21" dur="5.009">people in trust that is the only power</text>
  <text start="373.509" dur="4.351">they have so we kind of been taught to</text>
  <text start="375.219" dur="4.891">look at the Constitution backwards we go</text>
  <text start="377.86" dur="4.41">a say is this or that constitutional we</text>
  <text start="380.11" dur="4.2">look for attorney to tell us what we</text>
  <text start="382.27" dur="4.41">should say is show me the page where we</text>
  <text start="384.31" dur="4.59">told you you can do that show me the</text>
  <text start="386.68" dur="4.88">paragraph and that&amp;#39;s that silence is</text>
  <text start="388.9" dur="5.22">everything so just like we have</text>
  <text start="391.56" dur="4.87">simplicity in the gospel we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="394.12" dur="4.8">removed from simplicity with the law and</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="5.13">we got to get back so</text>
  <text start="398.92" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;ll be trafficking Trump&amp;#39;s trafficking</text>
  <text start="401.56" dur="6.44">council came to Arizona we didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="403.45" dur="7.41">they were going to come truck Arizona</text>
  <text start="408" dur="6.04">publicized the event the day before on a</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="5.46">holiday so it was May 27th or May 28th</text>
  <text start="414.04" dur="3.81">Memorial Day they put up that they were</text>
  <text start="416.32" dur="2.91">going to have the event I went to the</text>
  <text start="417.85" dur="5.55">event and some of the other members of</text>
  <text start="419.23" dur="6.36">the AZ BCS oversight group and what</text>
  <text start="423.4" dur="5.58">ended up happening was is that one of</text>
  <text start="425.59" dur="6.57">trumps head appointees was there and the</text>
  <text start="428.98" dur="7.74">DOJ was there and many other people who</text>
  <text start="432.16" dur="8.31">actually are arresting or involved with</text>
  <text start="436.72" dur="8.52">arresting traffickers and so what we did</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="7.02">was three of us went up to explained the</text>
  <text start="445.24" dur="6.48">definition of trafficking so any time</text>
  <text start="447.49" dur="7.44">just like Deuteronomy 24/7 that anyone</text>
  <text start="451.72" dur="6.96">makes merchandise of someone or still</text>
  <text start="454.93" dur="7.53">someone for money or sell at them the</text>
  <text start="458.68" dur="6.21">Bible calls them at B so this this idea</text>
  <text start="462.46" dur="5.07">of trafficking and kidnapping by</text>
  <text start="464.89" dur="5.67">definition CPS is taking kids from</text>
  <text start="467.53" dur="6.66">people in order to make federal funds in</text>
  <text start="470.56" dur="5.01">a private partnership and that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="474.19" dur="2.91">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing with the kids</text>
  <text start="475.57" dur="3.63">so they&amp;#39;re taking the kids and and</text>
  <text start="477.1" dur="3.45">either selling them or making</text>
  <text start="479.2" dur="3.53">merchandise of them where they get</text>
  <text start="480.55" dur="4.05">monthly income or yearly income</text>
  <text start="482.73" dur="5.41">eighty-three thousand seven hundred</text>
  <text start="484.6" dur="5.25">forty thousand a year so what we did was</text>
  <text start="488.14" dur="4.26">as we explain the definition we showed</text>
  <text start="489.85" dur="5.99">how Arizona had lost over a thousand</text>
  <text start="492.4" dur="7.02">kids in recent history has lost them and</text>
  <text start="495.84" dur="7.42">when I when I got up I went back to the</text>
  <text start="499.42" dur="6.48">Social Security yet and I went to the</text>
  <text start="503.26" dur="5.49">original legislation so the 1935</text>
  <text start="505.9" dur="6.54">administrator 1935 Social Security Act</text>
  <text start="508.75" dur="5.88">actually says in it that it is not to be</text>
  <text start="512.44" dur="5.18">construed nothing in the Act is to be</text>
  <text start="514.63" dur="8.4">construed to give any federal official</text>
  <text start="517.62" dur="8.28">representative or officer the right to</text>
  <text start="523.03" dur="5.1">take a parent a child from their parent</text>
  <text start="525.9" dur="4">against the will of the parent it</text>
  <text start="528.13" dur="4.57">actually said that in their section 11</text>
  <text start="529.9" dur="4.96">so where we thought that</text>
  <text start="532.7" dur="4.98">CPS had the right based on the Social</text>
  <text start="534.86" dur="4.71">Security Act to take kids when I went</text>
  <text start="537.68" dur="4.44">and looked it actually says the opposite</text>
  <text start="539.57" dur="5.25">so when the head want the head woman who</text>
  <text start="542.12" dur="3.99">was there saw it everybody&amp;#39;s mouth in</text>
  <text start="544.82" dur="3.69">the room hit the floor I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="546.11" dur="5.16">probably a hundred people in the world</text>
  <text start="548.51" dur="6.03">many of them working in child protection</text>
  <text start="551.27" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re collaborating to give services</text>
  <text start="554.54" dur="5.55">which makes them money police judges</text>
  <text start="557.03" dur="5.49">were their attorneys guardian ad litems</text>
  <text start="560.09" dur="5.07">all these different people when they saw</text>
  <text start="562.52" dur="5.76">that law their mouth hit the floor cuz</text>
  <text start="565.16" dur="5.58">they never seen it and so twenty nine</text>
  <text start="568.28" dur="12.33">days later the head of CPS and Arizona</text>
  <text start="570.74" dur="11.49">steps now oh yeah so guys again yeah</text>
  <text start="580.61" dur="3.54">this is this is really good in fact</text>
  <text start="582.23" dur="3.98">before I started the interview Davis off</text>
  <text start="584.15" dur="4.59">there&amp;#39;s a really really good analogy</text>
  <text start="586.21" dur="4.57">with when he talked about the simplicity</text>
  <text start="588.74" dur="3.39">you know rather than look listening to</text>
  <text start="590.78" dur="3.93">all these commentaries and trying to</text>
  <text start="592.13" dur="4.46">convolute and try to confuse us without</text>
  <text start="594.71" dur="4.59">understand Scripture we go to the Bible</text>
  <text start="596.59" dur="4.78">ourselves with the Spirit of God work</text>
  <text start="599.3" dur="3.99">for us and we read how simple it is to</text>
  <text start="601.37" dur="4.08">obey his word as Commandments to love</text>
  <text start="603.29" dur="3.78">him and it&amp;#39;s the same thing with this</text>
  <text start="605.45" dur="5.04">they try to confuse this with all of</text>
  <text start="607.07" dur="5.01">these laws that most of them are all of</text>
  <text start="610.49" dur="3.03">them are illegal they&amp;#39;re coming against</text>
  <text start="612.08" dur="3.75">their constitution to come me against</text>
  <text start="613.52" dur="4.11">the basic Bill of Rights and as you say</text>
  <text start="615.83" dur="4.38">but just need a very simple a very</text>
  <text start="617.63" dur="5.43">simple way of going back to what did the</text>
  <text start="620.21" dur="4.8">actual Social Security Act say and then</text>
  <text start="623.06" dur="4.38">boom they lost their power so that was</text>
  <text start="625.01" dur="4.8">just one little example okay so I want</text>
  <text start="627.44" dur="4.98">to go into the nuts and bolts of it I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="629.81" dur="4.26">a parent I&amp;#39;ve got CPS knocking on my</text>
  <text start="632.42" dur="4.5">door they&amp;#39;re threatening my children</text>

  <text start="689.54" dur="6.12">there&amp;#39;s multiple people profiting off of</text>
  <text start="691.4" dur="6.27">this and so first thing it is it is not</text>
  <text start="695.66" dur="3.96">it is not government it is a private</text>
  <text start="697.67" dur="4.11">for-profit organization it is no</text>
  <text start="699.62" dur="4.89">different than when McDonald&amp;#39;s or</text>
  <text start="701.78" dur="4.68">Walmart so first off would you let</text>
  <text start="704.51" dur="4.14">McDonald&amp;#39;s or Walmart come into your</text>
  <text start="706.46" dur="4.23">house and start finding to know about</text>
  <text start="708.65" dur="4.83">how you parent your children if your</text>
  <text start="710.69" dur="5.22">house is clean or not no nobody would</text>
  <text start="713.48" dur="4.2">ever allow that so they are not exempt</text>
  <text start="715.91" dur="5.16">from that they have to have a warrant</text>
  <text start="717.68" dur="5.49">and so that is only issued on probable</text>
  <text start="721.07" dur="6.15">cause so they have to do their due</text>
  <text start="723.17" dur="5.97">diligence of finding out what you know</text>
  <text start="727.22" dur="7.5">if there&amp;#39;s any kind of complaints and</text>
  <text start="729.14" dur="7.89">then getting a testimony by an affidavit</text>
  <text start="734.72" dur="4.11">under penalty of perjury and then that</text>
  <text start="737.03" dur="4.95">is how they get a warrant from an</text>
  <text start="738.83" dur="5.52">article 3 court then they may now enter</text>
  <text start="741.98" dur="5.43">and even on that warrant if you go back</text>
  <text start="744.35" dur="6.09">to even just our original Constitution</text>
  <text start="747.41" dur="6.78">and our state constitutions a warrant</text>
  <text start="750.44" dur="7.05">has to say specifically where it is what</text>
  <text start="754.19" dur="7.05">it is where they can find it and any</text>
  <text start="757.49" dur="6.6">things or people to be seized and so it</text>
  <text start="761.24" dur="4.68">is very specific so it can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="764.09" dur="4.77">oh we just have a want we&amp;#39;re just gonna</text>
  <text start="765.92" dur="5.55">check through your whole house no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="768.86" dur="4.56">not and that is again check Constitution</text>
  <text start="771.47" dur="5.37">or state constitutions it out ways that</text>
  <text start="773.42" dur="5.49">very simplistically ok so this is a</text>
  <text start="776.84" dur="3.33">really good point guys because if</text>
  <text start="778.91" dur="3.42">somebody just makes some sort of</text>
  <text start="780.17" dur="3.84">anonymous phone call and complains about</text>
  <text start="782.33" dur="3.75">your parenting that&amp;#39;s not enough you</text>
  <text start="784.01" dur="3.84">need to demand that they get a warrant</text>
  <text start="786.08" dur="3.51">that there&amp;#39;s affidavits to back up this</text>
  <text start="787.85" dur="4.08">warrant that there&amp;#39;s all these things</text>
  <text start="789.59" dur="3.6">although I will say I know you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="791.93" dur="2.91">heard from people that say well what</text>
  <text start="793.19" dur="4.05">what about when these CPS they show up</text>
  <text start="794.84" dur="3.68">with a police and you know they have</text>
  <text start="797.24" dur="2.69">maybe</text>
  <text start="798.52" dur="6.39">that was just hastily signed by a judge</text>
  <text start="799.93" dur="8.04">what do I do in that situation well they</text>
  <text start="804.91" dur="5.94">actually cannot come to you like that</text>
  <text start="807.97" dur="4.41">when they have multiple people of</text>
  <text start="810.85" dur="4.22">Governments that&amp;#39;s when you have</text>
  <text start="812.38" dur="4.74">multiple I mean public servants</text>
  <text start="815.07" dur="3.79">especially when they usually get cops</text>
  <text start="817.12" dur="4.98">involved when you start having multiples</text>
  <text start="818.86" dur="6">of them that is that&amp;#39;s intimidating that</text>
  <text start="822.1" dur="5.1">would put anybody under duress and so</text>
  <text start="824.86" dur="5.64">those are actually felonies it is a</text>
  <text start="827.2" dur="6.93">felony under Title 18 United States Code</text>
  <text start="830.5" dur="5.76">section 241 so when they come because</text>
  <text start="834.13" dur="3.899">color of law so just because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="836.26" dur="4.26">wearing their police uniforms it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="838.029" dur="3.93">give people them all right that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="840.52" dur="4.29">how they&amp;#39;re supposed to be acting in</text>
  <text start="841.959" dur="4.351">their governmental capacity that means</text>
  <text start="844.81" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re just you know that&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="846.31" dur="4.8">bunch of henchmen coming to you and so</text>
  <text start="848.56" dur="4.71">there&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;ve seen videos people do get</text>
  <text start="851.11" dur="6.02">intimidated it is scary and they cannot</text>
  <text start="853.27" dur="7.14">use coercion and fear to to rule</text>
  <text start="857.13" dur="6.79">lawfully amen amen</text>
  <text start="860.41" dur="4.619">okay so let you continue with anything</text>
  <text start="863.92" dur="2.7">else you&amp;#39;d like to talk about with the</text>
  <text start="865.029" dur="3.271">nuts and bolts of what parents can do</text>
  <text start="866.62" dur="6.45">we&amp;#39;re in this situation and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="868.3" dur="8.27">move and talk about what he knows okay</text>
  <text start="873.07" dur="5.759">um so I big thing about not letting them</text>
  <text start="876.57" dur="6.28">start intruding into your life unless</text>
  <text start="878.829" dur="5.911">they have a warrant and also big thing</text>
  <text start="882.85" dur="5.37">is do not sign anything a lot of this</text>
  <text start="884.74" dur="5.94">has to do with contract law where</text>
  <text start="888.22" dur="5.369">they&amp;#39;re duping you into services and</text>
  <text start="890.68" dur="4.62">programs with the promises of all you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="893.589" dur="3.81">get your kid back if you do this but</text>
  <text start="895.3" dur="3.24">there&amp;#39;s so many numerous stories I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="897.399" dur="3.69">sure you&amp;#39;ve heard of them too where</text>
  <text start="898.54" dur="4.59">people will have don&amp;#39;t we have to do</text>
  <text start="901.089" dur="4.681">this drug test and all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="903.13" dur="4.35">they say all it was it was positive and</text>
  <text start="905.77" dur="3.509">the parent will like go to another one</text>
  <text start="907.48" dur="3.599">so that they could try to prove like no</text>
  <text start="909.279" dur="3.631">there&amp;#39;s no drugs in my system it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="911.079" dur="4.851">it&amp;#39;s a bunch of Hoops that they try to</text>
  <text start="912.91" dur="8.13">have you go through record everything</text>
  <text start="915.93" dur="9.149">because again a lot of this is private</text>
  <text start="921.04" dur="8.94">and so they you don&amp;#39;t know how they will</text>
  <text start="925.079" dur="7.181">construe what you are saying a lot</text>
  <text start="929.98" dur="4.11">times if you are having a disagreement</text>
  <text start="932.26" dur="3.6">with your partner and they can say oh</text>
  <text start="934.09" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s domestic violence they were</text>
  <text start="935.86" dur="5.03">having this argument so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="937.78" dur="6.66">important that you record everything</text>
  <text start="940.89" dur="6.61">because my friend had described it to me</text>
  <text start="944.44" dur="5.67">as as much as they&amp;#39;re trying to put a</text>
  <text start="947.5" dur="4.5">case together against you what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="950.11" dur="3.99">doing and is if you can stand up for</text>
  <text start="952" dur="3.99">your rights know what you can do record</text>
  <text start="954.1" dur="3.51">everything you are building a case</text>
  <text start="955.99" dur="3.63">against them about how they are</text>
  <text start="957.61" dur="6.29">depriving you of your rights and how</text>
  <text start="959.62" dur="4.28">they are acting very unlawfully</text>
  <text start="964.23" dur="6.94">absolutely they are huge into dividing</text>
  <text start="968.08" dur="4.68">families so again that&amp;#39;s if you think</text>
  <text start="971.17" dur="3.99">about it if they&amp;#39;re supposed to be there</text>
  <text start="972.76" dur="5.55">for the welfare of Children and Families</text>
  <text start="975.16" dur="5.76">like they will tell you to split with</text>
  <text start="978.31" dur="6.6">your husband or your wife or over</text>
  <text start="980.92" dur="5.7">domestic violence issues they will try</text>
  <text start="984.91" dur="6.18">to tell you you can get your kids faster</text>
  <text start="986.62" dur="7.2">if you do this it&amp;#39;s try to remain not</text>
  <text start="991.09" dur="5.13">fearful and realize that if you have a</text>
  <text start="993.82" dur="5.28">loving family just because of fear do</text>
  <text start="996.22" dur="9.87">not let their lives try to divide this</text>
  <text start="999.1" dur="8.55">family further yeah it&amp;#39;s not uncommon</text>
  <text start="1006.09" dur="2.73">for them both to once they take your</text>
  <text start="1007.65" dur="3.09">children a lot of times they will</text>
  <text start="1008.82" dur="4.32">diagnose them with a multitude of</text>
  <text start="1010.74" dur="4.85">different most mental illnesses and</text>
  <text start="1013.14" dur="5.64">that&amp;#39;s ultimately I&amp;#39;ll just firm money</text>
  <text start="1015.59" dur="6.58">so they&amp;#39;ll make your kid diagnosed with</text>
  <text start="1018.78" dur="5.33">autism ADHD a lot of times</text>
  <text start="1022.17" dur="4.89">post-traumatic stress disorder which</text>
  <text start="1024.11" dur="6.04">could be any child taken from their home</text>
  <text start="1027.06" dur="6.51">that&amp;#39;s a very traumatic event and so</text>
  <text start="1030.15" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s wrong right yeah</text>
  <text start="1033.57" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re causing the very thing that</text>
  <text start="1034.98" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;re accusing you of causing their</text>
  <text start="1037.5" dur="5.88">children such a trap okay</text>
  <text start="1041.55" dur="4.05">David I&amp;#39;m gonna switch over to you and</text>
  <text start="1043.38" dur="9.45">and let you talk about this matter just</text>
  <text start="1045.6" dur="12.51">the nuts and bolts of what parents so</text>
  <text start="1052.83" dur="7.29">first of all what I see and what and</text>
  <text start="1058.11" dur="4.89">what I believe is the best thing to do</text>
  <text start="1060.12" dur="6.27">in my opinion is to</text>
  <text start="1063" dur="6.09">first of all don&amp;#39;t wait until you have a</text>
  <text start="1066.39" dur="6.51">Child Protective Services situation to</text>
  <text start="1069.09" dur="6.81">be proactive so with the affidavit that</text>
  <text start="1072.9" dur="6.509">I have what is doing is this providing</text>
  <text start="1075.9" dur="5.67">service and notice to the people in</text>
  <text start="1079.409" dur="5.221">those positions who are not getting</text>
  <text start="1081.57" dur="6.599">trained that their own law says that</text>
  <text start="1084.63" dur="5.52">they can&amp;#39;t do this because the way that</text>
  <text start="1088.169" dur="4.111">they work is is they purposely don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1090.15" dur="4.29">train the police they purposely don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1092.28" dur="4.59">train CPS they purposely don&amp;#39;t train</text>
  <text start="1094.44" dur="3.96">these people so that when they do the</text>
  <text start="1096.87" dur="5.88">wrong thing they can say it was in good</text>
  <text start="1098.4" dur="6.45">faith so I get him before they start now</text>
  <text start="1102.75" dur="4.02">so when somebody tells me a Dave I think</text>
  <text start="1104.85" dur="4.26">that CPS is gonna mess me I heard that</text>
  <text start="1106.77" dur="3.899">somebody was gonna make a call or they</text>
  <text start="1109.11" dur="3.99">were mad at me or something like that</text>
  <text start="1110.669" dur="5.851">I say look say Nanna affidavit to the</text>
  <text start="1113.1" dur="5.91">head of CBS which will be noticed to</text>
  <text start="1116.52" dur="4.74">agent as notice the principal notice the</text>
  <text start="1119.01" dur="4.169">principal&amp;#39;s notice to agent so this way</text>
  <text start="1121.26" dur="3.24">nobody can make an excuse to say that</text>
  <text start="1123.179" dur="3.691">they don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;ll send it to the</text>
  <text start="1124.5" dur="7.38">police I&amp;#39;ll send it to the sheriff in</text>
  <text start="1126.87" dur="7.98">the area so that way to the governor to</text>
  <text start="1131.88" dur="5.84">the legislature so that all parties know</text>
  <text start="1134.85" dur="7.199">that what they&amp;#39;re doing is wrong because</text>
  <text start="1137.72" dur="7.839">just for example in the Troxel versus</text>
  <text start="1142.049" dur="5.311">Granville 2000 case we can find where</text>
  <text start="1145.559" dur="3.87">Washington used to have but what they</text>
  <text start="1147.36" dur="4.77">called a state law that was a statute</text>
  <text start="1149.429" dur="5.191">that said that any person could make a</text>
  <text start="1152.13" dur="6.029">petition for your kid at any time and</text>
  <text start="1154.62" dur="7.89">give the court discretion to take him</text>
  <text start="1158.159" dur="7.561">now in that Trachsel versus Granville</text>
  <text start="1162.51" dur="4.86">case you&amp;#39;ll hear attorneys say well it</text>
  <text start="1165.72" dur="4.02">was found that a grandparent couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1167.37" dur="5.22">take the kids from a mother or father it</text>
  <text start="1169.74" dur="4.59">was found that children are liberty</text>
  <text start="1172.59" dur="4.079">interest but they don&amp;#39;t tell you what</text>
  <text start="1174.33" dur="3.959">that means usually and they don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="1176.669" dur="5.13">you the most important part of the case</text>
  <text start="1178.289" dur="5.841">in that case the Washington so-called</text>
  <text start="1181.799" dur="6.451">law was struck down as unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="1184.13" dur="6.11">that gave people permission to petition</text>
  <text start="1188.25" dur="5.12">for your kid</text>
  <text start="1190.24" dur="5.5">so the very so-called</text>
  <text start="1193.37" dur="5.1">law itself the attorneys won&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="1195.74" dur="4.38">about that because they need us to</text>
  <text start="1198.47" dur="4.89">believe that what we&amp;#39;re seeing in these</text>
  <text start="1200.12" dur="6">statutes aren&amp;#39;t the law but we got to</text>
  <text start="1203.36" dur="5.1">look at it like this God has the highest</text>
  <text start="1206.12" dur="4.53">law so when we look in the Bible we look</text>
  <text start="1208.46" dur="5.67">at Daniel and we look at where the</text>
  <text start="1210.65" dur="5.519">Hebrew boys we find that they were told</text>
  <text start="1214.13" dur="4.77">to worship the King at a certain time</text>
  <text start="1216.169" dur="5.401">and they had to bow down to the king and</text>
  <text start="1218.9" dur="5.94">if you didn&amp;#39;t you would die now the King</text>
  <text start="1221.57" dur="5.67">made a law that was the hard to land but</text>
  <text start="1224.84" dur="5.49">God said don&amp;#39;t bow down to a man worship</text>
  <text start="1227.24" dur="6.72">him only so they decided not to do that</text>
  <text start="1230.33" dur="7.53">and God rewarded them for it so God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1233.96" dur="7.709">law cats without any Edict of a king in</text>
  <text start="1237.86" dur="6.23">the same way the legislature based on</text>
  <text start="1241.669" dur="5.701">Miranda versus Arizona and many other</text>
  <text start="1244.09" dur="6.52">laws and rights we have they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1247.37" dur="7.02">the power to make a law against the</text>
  <text start="1250.61" dur="7.02">people&amp;#39;s rights so as long as nobody</text>
  <text start="1254.39" dur="6.45">challenges it the court will steal all</text>
  <text start="1257.63" dur="6.419">day and night they&amp;#39;ll take your kids</text>
  <text start="1260.84" dur="5.76">make money off of them run thousands of</text>
  <text start="1264.049" dur="4.321">cases like they did in Washington until</text>
  <text start="1266.6" dur="3.81">one person takes us to the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="1268.37" dur="5.22">and the Supreme Court says you know you</text>
  <text start="1270.41" dur="5.639">guys can&amp;#39;t do that now they can ooh they</text>
  <text start="1273.59" dur="4.829">couldn&amp;#39;t do it but because the people</text>
  <text start="1276.049" dur="5.491">were not educated enough to know they</text>
  <text start="1278.419" dur="5.611">couldn&amp;#39;t do it the deception caused them</text>
  <text start="1281.54" dur="4.379">to lose their children in many cases so</text>
  <text start="1284.03" dur="4.139">right now today it is the same exact</text>
  <text start="1285.919" dur="5.161">thing they&amp;#39;re deceiving you into being</text>
  <text start="1288.169" dur="5.76">involved with them and the attorneys</text>
  <text start="1291.08" dur="5.28">want the cases so they&amp;#39;re holding back</text>
  <text start="1293.929" dur="4.731">information so we got to look at</text>
  <text start="1296.36" dur="4.559">something when we make a decision we</text>
  <text start="1298.66" dur="4.75">many times we can work out of fear but</text>
  <text start="1300.919" dur="4.741">you got to ask a question people will</text>
  <text start="1303.41" dur="5.16">say if you want things to work out for</text>
  <text start="1305.66" dur="3.33">you need a good attorney right now you</text>
  <text start="1308.57" dur="2.13">got it</text>
  <text start="1308.99" dur="4.08">knowledge that thinking it asked the</text>

  <text start="1349.67" dur="5.7">helping us we need to examine are the</text>
  <text start="1353.51" dur="3.72">attorneys really helping us or are we</text>

  <text start="1444.02" dur="3.45">trying to figure out how to win they</text>
  <text start="1445.4" dur="5.28">need the key to give them the knowledge</text>

  <text start="1471.539" dur="4.35">they hinder them and they won&amp;#39;t go in</text>
  <text start="1473.909" dur="4.411">themselves so when you look at the</text>
  <text start="1475.889" dur="4.801">Black&amp;#39;s Law Dictionary you&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="1478.32" dur="5.069">a key on their mocking this very verse</text>
  <text start="1480.69" dur="5.369">that Jesus said and so will we</text>
  <text start="1483.389" dur="4.26">understand that Jesus himself told us</text>
  <text start="1486.059" dur="4.11">that the attorneys were going to lie to</text>
  <text start="1487.649" dur="5.13">us they were going to hide the key of</text>
  <text start="1490.169" dur="5.37">knowledge but because as a nation we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1492.779" dur="4.831">been tricked to get rid of God we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1495.539" dur="5.161">look at the source of the common law</text>
  <text start="1497.61" dur="5.85">which is the Bible we don&amp;#39;t believe what</text>
  <text start="1500.7" dur="6.599">Jesus has said so we trust those who we</text>
  <text start="1503.46" dur="6.569">know are liars attorneys are known to be</text>
  <text start="1507.299" dur="6.36">liars in America but we trust them with</text>
  <text start="1510.029" dur="8.61">our kids and we&amp;#39;ve been losing says 1997</text>
  <text start="1513.659" dur="6.99">like crazy but for the first time we</text>
  <text start="1518.639" dur="4.41">have been able to find that in the</text>
  <text start="1520.649" dur="4.41">original public laws that it actually</text>
  <text start="1523.049" dur="5.281">said they don&amp;#39;t have the power to take</text>
  <text start="1525.059" dur="6.811">his in the ass for law is said that they</text>
  <text start="1528.33" dur="7.17">can&amp;#39;t interfere with private family with</text>
  <text start="1531.87" dur="6.179">with the private rights of family they</text>
  <text start="1535.5" dur="4.35">cannot infringe on what kind of choices</text>
  <text start="1538.049" dur="5.311">you made Chris is like if you want to</text>
  <text start="1539.85" dur="5.1">take vaccinations or not they can&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="1543.36" dur="3.539">you how to raise your kid if you want to</text>
  <text start="1544.95" dur="4.89">go to church five times a week they</text>
  <text start="1546.899" dur="5.041">can&amp;#39;t tell you you can&amp;#39;t but that was</text>
  <text start="1549.84" dur="3.66">hidden from the people so it actually</text>
  <text start="1551.94" dur="3.119">exists so I would give the affidavit</text>
  <text start="1553.5" dur="4.799">which the affidavit has that in there</text>
  <text start="1555.059" dur="4.74">and then what I would also do is because</text>
  <text start="1558.299" dur="4.47">the government officials are our</text>
  <text start="1559.799" dur="5.551">trustees I will write out a contract</text>
  <text start="1562.769" dur="4.471">which the affidavit is that says that if</text>
  <text start="1565.35" dur="4.409">you decide to infringe on my right you</text>
  <text start="1567.24" dur="5.159">as a man agree to pay me this much now</text>
  <text start="1569.759" dur="4.17">the reason I do that is because the</text>
  <text start="1572.399" dur="3.831">Bible tells you if you have an issue</text>
  <text start="1573.929" dur="4.321">with your brother go to him one on one</text>
  <text start="1576.23" dur="4.27">so I&amp;#39;m going to send you a private</text>
  <text start="1578.25" dur="4.769">affidavit one on one and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="1580.5" dur="7.35">explain what the facts are and if you</text>
  <text start="1583.019" dur="8.101">don&amp;#39;t deny you accept if you try to deny</text>
  <text start="1587.85" dur="6.63">I can get a notary public or another</text>
  <text start="1591.12" dur="5.37">person as a witness and I can send out</text>
  <text start="1594.48" dur="3.6">something else to establish the facts or</text>
  <text start="1596.49" dur="4.59">even if they just don&amp;#39;t respond</text>
  <text start="1598.08" dur="8.01">the Bible says bring one or two others</text>
  <text start="1601.08" dur="7.11">to establish every word so God is</text>
  <text start="1606.09" dur="3.6">teaching you the common law process so</text>
  <text start="1608.19" dur="3.99">when you sent out the affidavit they</text>
  <text start="1609.69" dur="4.92">don&amp;#39;t deny it and then you send out</text>
  <text start="1612.18" dur="5.3">something else let it be known the words</text>
  <text start="1614.61" dur="5.58">that were established they end up</text>
  <text start="1617.48" dur="5.89">forfeiting their ability to fight you so</text>
  <text start="1620.19" dur="5.64">now you can be awarded in any court</text>
  <text start="1623.37" dur="4.71">because they fail to respond to your</text>
  <text start="1625.83" dur="5.31">affidavit which stands it&amp;#39;s true so</text>
  <text start="1628.08" dur="4.29">these people are doing in wickedness and</text>
  <text start="1631.14" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re doing it for money the only</text>
  <text start="1632.37" dur="3.93">thing that stops them from doing stuff</text>
  <text start="1634.14" dur="5.67">for money is the danger of going to jail</text>
  <text start="1636.3" dur="5.46">or hitting them in their pocketbook so I</text>
  <text start="1639.81" dur="5.28">say look you owe me five thousand</text>
  <text start="1641.76" dur="4.8">dollars a day hurt child you decided to</text>
  <text start="1645.09" dur="3.18">take my little ones and I put it on</text>
  <text start="1646.56" dur="4.02">eight and a half by fourteen papers so</text>
  <text start="1648.27" dur="4.2">US legal paper just like any contract</text>
  <text start="1650.58" dur="3.33">and I sent it to him and I let them in I</text>
  <text start="1652.47" dur="3.75">let them ignore it or I let them talk</text>
  <text start="1653.91" dur="3.99">back they usually will not talk back</text>
  <text start="1656.22" dur="4.44">because they lose all immunity if they</text>
  <text start="1657.9" dur="4.77">do so which they don&amp;#39;t really have</text>
  <text start="1660.66" dur="5.04">immunity but that perceived community is</text>
  <text start="1662.67" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s an eraser right so I would send</text>
  <text start="1665.7" dur="3">that out first</text>
  <text start="1667.02" dur="3.9">and then to get to the point with what</text>
  <text start="1668.7" dur="3.75">else I would do I would not let him in</text>
  <text start="1670.92" dur="7.2">my house I would tell them no you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1672.45" dur="7.86">enter my home I will tell them that if</text>
  <text start="1678.12" dur="5.07">they want to take my little ones they</text>
  <text start="1680.31" dur="5.4">need to have a jury of my peers here at</text>
  <text start="1683.19" dur="3.96">case first if you look and ask for it</text>
  <text start="1685.71" dur="4.56">actually says that you have to be</text>
  <text start="1687.15" dur="4.71">prosecuted a jury of your peers had to</text>
  <text start="1690.27" dur="3.59">say that you did something wrong in a</text>
  <text start="1691.86" dur="5.07">Judicial Court not an administrative</text>
  <text start="1693.86" dur="5.08">executive branch court but in a judicial</text>
  <text start="1696.93" dur="3.54">court and that&amp;#39;s another trick they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1698.94" dur="2.76">they&amp;#39;ll get people from the executive</text>
  <text start="1700.47" dur="2.64">branch to give you what&amp;#39;s called a pick</text>
  <text start="1701.7" dur="4.2">up order and parents think that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1703.11" dur="6.03">warrant is not a pick up order comes</text>
  <text start="1705.9" dur="6.18">from the attorney for CPS CPS is under</text>
  <text start="1709.14" dur="4.8">the executive branch right so how is the</text>
  <text start="1712.08" dur="4.07">executive branch writing orders for your</text>
  <text start="1713.94" dur="2.21">kids</text>
  <text start="1716.33" dur="8.799">only a judge the Judicial Department can</text>
  <text start="1719.909" dur="7.11">give orders these people are under the</text>
  <text start="1725.129" dur="3.811">executive branch as an independent</text>
  <text start="1727.019" dur="3.15">private business and writing out pick up</text>
  <text start="1728.94" dur="4.29">orders for your kids and people are</text>
  <text start="1730.169" dur="6.151">giving them away every day so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1733.23" dur="6.569">deceiving and so but here&amp;#39;s the good</text>
  <text start="1736.32" dur="7.41">need because they use executive branch</text>
  <text start="1739.799" dur="6.781">documents under the separation of powers</text>
  <text start="1743.73" dur="4.35">doctrine only a judge and the judicial</text>
  <text start="1746.58" dur="3.75">branch can make a judicial order that</text>
  <text start="1748.08" dur="3.75">means that every man or woman who got</text>
  <text start="1750.33" dur="4.199">their kids taken and people writing</text>
  <text start="1751.83" dur="7.04">orders in title for courts it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="2169.79" dur="4.44">the Scriptures we can see a lie their</text>
  <text start="2171.98" dur="3.629">whole goal is to prevent the parents</text>
  <text start="2174.23" dur="4.65">from learning about what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="2175.609" dur="6.091">because the trafficking system is is</text>
  <text start="2178.88" dur="6.33">carried out through CPS so if we shut it</text>
  <text start="2181.7" dur="5.43">down they lose tons of money they lose</text>
  <text start="2185.21" dur="6.06">children that they like to rape and</text>

  <text start="2193.49" dur="5.04">with the system so we are we are really</text>
  <text start="2196.22" dur="4.73">taking them down fast as collapsing so</text>
  <text start="2198.53" dur="5.78">the parents need to know that because</text>
  <text start="2200.95" dur="6.25">they&amp;#39;re going to be inundated with</text>
  <text start="2204.31" dur="6.01">disinformation to stop them from doing</text>

  <text start="2213.349" dur="4.351">and again I hope if people take one</text>
  <text start="2215.42" dur="4.74">thing from this interview it is that you</text>
  <text start="2217.7" dur="4.38">should not be relying on the present</text>
  <text start="2220.16" dur="3.63">court system the way that it works or</text>
  <text start="2222.08" dur="4.44">the preconceived notions we have about</text>
  <text start="2223.79" dur="4.98">attorneys helping us that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2226.52" dur="3.599">where we should be especially those are</text>

  <text start="2247.41" dur="2.97">and I know it seems sort of overwhelming</text>
  <text start="2248.94" dur="3.149">because we&amp;#39;re thinking wow we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="2250.38" dur="3.75">against the very fabric of the judicial</text>
  <text start="2252.089" dur="3.811">system at least the way it&amp;#39;s set up in</text>
  <text start="2254.13" dur="5.01">in the way they want it to think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2255.9" dur="4.919">setup you do the right thing you proceed</text>

  <text start="2274.53" dur="4.44">of these people I like to give some</text>
  <text start="2277.44" dur="4.05">people benefit about there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="2278.97" dur="4.95">police officers I think especially like</text>
  <text start="2281.49" dur="4.26">some of the CPS workers that they think</text>
  <text start="2283.92" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re just doing their job it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2285.75" dur="4.109">letting them know first off and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2288.21" dur="4.099">what&amp;#39;s so great about the affidavit it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2289.859" dur="5.76">like hey go back to the Constitution</text>
  <text start="2292.309" dur="4.871">especially if you&amp;#39;re a cop or a judge or</text>
  <text start="2295.619" dur="5.281">an attorney it&amp;#39;s like you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2297.18" dur="7.35">what you swore to uphold and it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="2300.9" dur="5.61">of destroyed back to the more simple</text>
  <text start="2304.53" dur="3.839">faces like I said the Constitution was</text>
  <text start="2306.51" dur="5.51">never meant to be complicated for people</text>
  <text start="2308.369" dur="7.111">it was to ensure our life and liberty</text>
  <text start="2312.02" dur="5.799">free for government interference and if</text>
  <text start="2315.48" dur="4.74">anybody does want to take any of these</text>
  <text start="2317.819" dur="4.891">away than we are guaranteed to process</text>
  <text start="2320.22" dur="5.069">what is you process again it is outlined</text>
  <text start="2322.71" dur="6.51">in our Constitution and so there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="2325.289" dur="6.601">of a lot of unnecessary suffering</text>
  <text start="2329.22" dur="5.97">happening because just a lot of people</text>
