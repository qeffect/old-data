  <text start="11.639" dur="4.141">to go but I were supposed to meet a</text>
  <text start="13.41" dur="4.44">journalist from the vanguard that wanted</text>
  <text start="15.78" dur="2.88">to do an interview with me the Vanguard</text>
  <text start="17.85" dur="5.13">is the Portland State University</text>
  <text start="18.66" dur="6.42">newspaper so I went down there today but</text>
  <text start="22.98" dur="3.6">I got there quite a bit earlier than</text>
  <text start="25.08" dur="2.64">when he showed up and so I did some I</text>
  <text start="26.58" dur="3.779">decided to do some open air preaching</text>

  <text start="39.09" dur="2.789">through a lot of stuff lately and I was</text>
  <text start="40.35" dur="3.63">very tired and sort of worried but well</text>
  <text start="41.879" dur="3.541">as soon as I started preaching this joy</text>
  <text start="43.98" dur="5.25">just fell upon me and it was a beautiful</text>
  <text start="45.42" dur="6.959">day here in Portland um the crowd was</text>
  <text start="49.23" dur="5.91">was very sober because I was preaching</text>
  <text start="52.379" dur="4.051">mainly on the true essence of the gospel</text>
  <text start="55.14" dur="3.27">like what my youtube was on earlier</text>
  <text start="56.43" dur="4.41">today what the true essence of the</text>
  <text start="58.41" dur="6.959">gospel really is that Yahshua shed his</text>
  <text start="60.84" dur="6.54">blood and and you know rose again in</text>
  <text start="65.369" dur="3.811">order that we might have the freedom to</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="3.48">obey His commandments as Torres so I was</text>
  <text start="69.18" dur="5.1">reading a lot from Hebrews 8 and</text>
  <text start="70.86" dur="6.86">Jeremiah 31 and as I just kept laboring</text>
  <text start="74.28" dur="5.79">over this the the sobriety in the crowd</text>
  <text start="77.72" dur="4.06">it was really neat because everyone was</text>
  <text start="80.07" dur="3.72">just sort of listening and then I got</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="3.839">these two I don&amp;#39;t even want to call them</text>
  <text start="83.79" dur="3.54">hecklers because they were so polite but</text>
  <text start="85.619" dur="3.301">to you know atheists there were</text>
  <text start="87.33" dur="4.289">philosophy majors and so we went back</text>
  <text start="88.92" dur="5.4">and forth on the Roche limit the age of</text>
  <text start="91.619" dur="5.881">the earth just various subjects</text>
  <text start="94.32" dur="4.439">regarding science and they asked some</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="3.24">really good questions like they asked</text>
  <text start="98.759" dur="4.051">why did Yahweh make the tree of good and</text>
  <text start="100.74" dur="3.87">evil and so we discussed that you know</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="2.94">that Yahweh didn&amp;#39;t want just innocent</text>
  <text start="104.61" dur="2.67">people he wanted people who were</text>
  <text start="105.75" dur="3.869">righteous and in order to go from</text>
  <text start="107.28" dur="5.909">innocence to righteousness you have to</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="5.131">have the choice to reject evil and so</text>
  <text start="113.189" dur="4.231">that&amp;#39;s why that tree of good and evil</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="4.86">was there so that was a really good</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="3.96">discussion and then one of the</text>
  <text start="119.61" dur="3.56">philosophy majors started getting kind</text>
  <text start="121.38" dur="3.86">of puffed up and proud and he was</text>
  <text start="123.17" dur="3.54">19 years olds like just I give him a</text>
  <text start="125.24" dur="3.45">card and told him to go to my link about</text>
  <text start="126.71" dur="3.96">you know for atheists agnostics but then</text>
  <text start="128.69" dur="4.56">just shifted toward reading psalm 119</text>
  <text start="130.67" dur="4.92">and just began to read that out and</text>
  <text start="133.25" dur="7.35">comment on it I stopped on the verse in</text>
  <text start="135.59" dur="7.26">psalm 119 where it says that give me</text>
  <text start="140.6" dur="4.29">your tour graciously and I pointed out</text>
  <text start="142.85" dur="3.81">that Torah the commandments and grace</text>
  <text start="144.89" dur="4.62">are not opposed they work hand in hand</text>
  <text start="146.66" dur="4.799">and anyway there were some other people</text>
  <text start="149.51" dur="2.93">that had some good questions and it was</text>
  <text start="151.459" dur="4.021">just a good day and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="152.44" dur="5.799">the the journalist for the psu newspaper</text>
  <text start="155.48" dur="4.62">the Vanguard showed up and shook his</text>
  <text start="158.239" dur="6.511">hand and then we went out off to a cafe</text>
  <text start="160.1" dur="6.71">off campus and he gave me about a I want</text>
  <text start="164.75" dur="4.47">to say like maybe a 45-minute interview</text>
  <text start="166.81" dur="6.459">and asked me some really good questions</text>
  <text start="169.22" dur="7.2">he was very friendly and just asked me</text>
  <text start="173.269" dur="4.5">about like why I do what I do he said</text>
  <text start="176.42" dur="3.05">he&amp;#39;s going to put the website in the</text>
