  <text start="0.199" dur="4.631">shabbat shalom mrs. Daniel John me with</text>
  <text start="3.06" dur="4.43">Torah restoration ministry this is now</text>
  <text start="4.83" dur="4.68">part three of my 17 part series</text>
  <text start="7.49" dur="4.75">reconciling the teachings of Messiah</text>
  <text start="9.51" dur="6.84">Yahshua and Apostle Paul and this is</text>
  <text start="12.24" dur="9.119">part 3 of 17 Acts chapter 10 and unclean</text>
  <text start="16.35" dur="7.23">foods Acts chapter 10 and unclean foods</text>
  <text start="21.359" dur="4.16">so again we have a similar situation</text>
  <text start="23.58" dur="5.73">here that we&amp;#39;ve discussed in part 2</text>
  <text start="25.519" dur="5.92">which in part 2 if you remember they</text>
  <text start="29.31" dur="3.929">were stunned and shocked the Gentiles</text>
  <text start="31.439" dur="3.271">could be grafted in that they could be</text>
  <text start="33.239" dur="3.151">built the holy spirit just like they</text>
  <text start="34.71" dur="4.61">were but they shouldn&amp;#39;t have been</text>
  <text start="36.39" dur="6.48">because as we saw in part 2 there were</text>
  <text start="39.32" dur="5.28">situations an example in the Torah in</text>
  <text start="42.87" dur="4.32">the Tanakh and the prophets where</text>
  <text start="44.6" dur="4.389">Gentiles and strangers were grafted into</text>
  <text start="47.19" dur="3.06">Israel when they were filled with the</text>
  <text start="48.989" dur="3.421">same spirit of the Jews and they were</text>
  <text start="50.25" dur="4.559">able to cleave into the yob Abraham</text>
  <text start="52.41" dur="4.02">Isaac and Jacob so this shouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="54.809" dur="3">been a shock but the reason it was is</text>
  <text start="56.43" dur="3.42">because by the time you get to the first</text>
  <text start="57.809" dur="3.991">century there have been a lot of manmade</text>
  <text start="59.85" dur="4.049">traditions and then part of those</text>
  <text start="61.8" dur="3.719">traditions were to put up this wall of</text>
  <text start="63.899" dur="2.731">partition between the Jews and the</text>
  <text start="65.519" dur="3.301">Gentiles</text>
  <text start="66.63" dur="4.98">whereas Torah actually the true written</text>
  <text start="68.82" dur="4.35">Torah made provision for Gentiles to</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="4.02">come into Israel</text>
  <text start="73.17" dur="4.05">back then it was looking forward to</text>
  <text start="75.63" dur="3.54">being under the Messiah&amp;#39;s blood to get</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="3.78">the Messiah had not yet come clean into</text>
  <text start="79.17" dur="3.69">the Yaba Abraham Isaac and Jacob and</text>
  <text start="81" dur="3.36">literally being part of Israel that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="3.11">what happened to Rahab the harlot that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="84.36" dur="3.99">what happened to ruth the moabite as&amp;#39;</text>
  <text start="85.97" dur="4.87">examples of the gentiles of strangers</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="4.32">coming in and joining to become part of</text>
  <text start="90.84" dur="3.63">israel and now of course it&amp;#39;s through</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="3.39">the blood of Yahshua that he&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="94.47" dur="4.259">shed that we can be grafted into Israel</text>
  <text start="96.06" dur="5.97">as well so in acts 10 we have a similar</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="5.911">situation where yah really has to give</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="4.949">this very intense vision to Peter so he</text>
  <text start="104.64" dur="4.68">can overcome these man-made traditions</text>
  <text start="106.979" dur="4.651">of thinking that there&amp;#39;s no way Gentiles</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="6.659">can be filled with the spirit and coming</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="6.15">to him now a lot of people misuse acts</text>
  <text start="115.979" dur="3.271">10 because they think of this look this</text>
  <text start="117.78" dur="3.15">says that we can eat all sorts of foods</text>
  <text start="119.25" dur="3.719">you can eat spiders and scorpions and</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="3.63">pork and shellfish and all the stuff</text>
  <text start="122.969" dur="2.821">that Peter saw but that&amp;#39;s really not</text>
  <text start="124.56" dur="1.879">what it&amp;#39;s saying and we&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="125.79" dur="6.13">right into it</text>
  <text start="126.439" dur="7.701">so in acts 10 it begins with the</text>
  <text start="131.92" dur="3.48">Cornelius who is a Gentile believing</text>
  <text start="134.14" dur="3.84">Gentile there was a certain man in</text>
  <text start="135.4" dur="4.35">Caesarea called Cornelius a Centurion of</text>
  <text start="137.98" dur="4.11">the band called the Italian band a</text>
  <text start="139.75" dur="4.35">devout man one that feared yah with all</text>
  <text start="142.09" dur="5.01">his house which gave much alms to the</text>
  <text start="144.1" dur="5.22">people and prayed to God always he saw</text>
  <text start="147.1" dur="4.38">in a vision evidently about the ninth</text>
  <text start="149.32" dur="4.95">hour of the day an angel of yah coming</text>
  <text start="151.48" dur="4.41">in to him and saying it in Cornelius and</text>
  <text start="154.27" dur="4.38">when he looked on him he was afraid and</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="5.1">said what is it Lord and he said unto</text>
  <text start="158.65" dur="5.16">Him your prayers and your alms are come</text>
  <text start="160.99" dur="4.95">up for memorial before yah and now send</text>
  <text start="163.81" dur="4.95">men to Joppa and call for one Simon</text>
  <text start="165.94" dur="5.94">whose surname is Peter he lodges with</text>
  <text start="168.76" dur="6.69">one Simon the Tanner whose house is by</text>
  <text start="171.88" dur="5.97">the seaside he shall tell you what you</text>
  <text start="175.45" dur="6">ought to do and when the angel spake</text>
  <text start="177.85" dur="5.37">unto Cornelius and was departed he</text>
  <text start="181.45" dur="3.63">called two of his household servants and</text>
  <text start="183.22" dur="4.38">a devout soldier of them that waited on</text>
  <text start="185.08" dur="4.62">him continually and when he had declared</text>
  <text start="187.6" dur="5.1">all those things unto them he sent them</text>
  <text start="189.7" dur="4.83">to Joppa now in the next day the morrow</text>
  <text start="192.7" dur="4.23">as they went on their journey and your</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="4.92">9:00 to the city Peter he went up on the</text>
  <text start="196.93" dur="4.95">housetop to pray about the sixth hour so</text>
  <text start="199.45" dur="4.289">this would have been about noon and he</text>
  <text start="201.88" dur="3.99">became very hungry and would have eaten</text>
  <text start="203.739" dur="5.041">but while they made ready he fell into a</text>
  <text start="205.87" dur="4.74">trance and he saw heaven opened and a</text>
  <text start="208.78" dur="4.44">certain vessel descending unto Him as it</text>
  <text start="210.61" dur="4.2">had been a great sheet or a tallit knit</text>
  <text start="213.22" dur="3.57">at the four corners and let down to the</text>
  <text start="214.81" dur="3.48">earth where in wrong manner of</text>
  <text start="216.79" dur="3.51">four-footed beasts of the earth</text>
  <text start="218.29" dur="4.32">and wild beasts and creeping things and</text>
  <text start="220.3" dur="4.86">fowls of the air and there came a voice</text>
  <text start="222.61" dur="5.61">to him saying rise Peter kill and eat</text>
  <text start="225.16" dur="5.13">Peter said not so Lord for I have never</text>
  <text start="228.22" dur="4.65">eaten anything that is common or unclean</text>
  <text start="230.29" dur="4.47">and again the voice spoken to him and</text>
  <text start="232.87" dur="5.97">said the second time what yah has</text>
  <text start="234.76" dur="6.42">cleanse call thou not common and this</text>
  <text start="238.84" dur="4.59">was done three times and the vessel was</text>
  <text start="241.18" dur="4.2">received up again into heaven and</text>
  <text start="243.43" dur="4.62">remember that verse 16 this was done</text>
  <text start="245.38" dur="6.15">three times that&amp;#39;s a huge key for this</text>
  <text start="248.05" dur="5.55">to understand what this vision means now</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="4.05">while Peter doubted himself what this</text>
  <text start="253.6" dur="3.6">vision which he should seen should mean</text>
  <text start="255.58" dur="3.719">it and why was he doubting because he</text>
  <text start="257.2" dur="4.65">was with Messiah Yahshua and Yahshua</text>
  <text start="259.299" dur="4.801">very clearly never ate anything that was</text>
  <text start="261.85" dur="2.82">unclean he kept the dietary laws and</text>
  <text start="264.1" dur="2.58">torez</text>
  <text start="264.67" dur="3.93">like what is this talking about how how</text>
  <text start="266.68" dur="3.12">could he be telling me to violate tor I</text>
  <text start="268.6" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t understand so he&amp;#39;s doubting</text>
  <text start="269.8" dur="4.95">himself what what does this mean and</text>
  <text start="272.47" dur="4.35">behold the men which were sent from</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="3.69">Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="276.82" dur="4.02">house and stood before the gate and</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="4.14">called and asked whether Simon which was</text>
  <text start="280.84" dur="3.99">surnamed Peter was lodged there and</text>
  <text start="282.58" dur="5.37">while Peter thought on the vision the</text>
  <text start="284.83" dur="5.97">spirit said and then behold free men</text>
  <text start="287.95" dur="4.86">seek you okay so that&amp;#39;s verse 19 so</text>
  <text start="290.8" dur="3.81">remember that that Khalid with all the</text>
  <text start="292.81" dur="4.59">unclean animals how many times did it</text>
  <text start="294.61" dur="5.13">come down three times in verse 16 and</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="6.15">now in verse anything we see three men</text>
  <text start="299.74" dur="6.39">standing at the gate and yah says to</text>
  <text start="303.55" dur="4.71">Peter arise therefore and get me down</text>
  <text start="306.13" dur="4.47">and go with them doubting nothing for I</text>
  <text start="308.26" dur="4.76">have sent them Peter don&amp;#39;t doubt I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="310.6" dur="7.26">going to show you what this means</text>
  <text start="313.02" dur="6.37">alright moving on to verse 21 then Peter</text>
  <text start="317.86" dur="3.15">went down to the men which were said</text>
  <text start="319.39" dur="4.31">unto him from Cornelius and said behold</text>
  <text start="321.01" dur="5.55">I am he whom you seek what is the cause</text>
  <text start="323.7" dur="5.56">wherefore you were come and they said</text>
  <text start="326.56" dur="4.77">Cornelius the Centurion a just man one</text>
  <text start="329.26" dur="5.1">that fears young and a good report among</text>
  <text start="331.33" dur="5.67">all the nation of the Jews was worn from</text>
  <text start="334.36" dur="5.07">yah by Holy Angel to send for thee into</text>
  <text start="337" dur="4.47">his house and to hear words of thee then</text>
  <text start="339.43" dur="4.02">call he them in and loves them and on</text>
  <text start="341.47" dur="4.2">the morrow Peter went away with them and</text>
  <text start="343.45" dur="4.41">certain brethren from Joppa accompanied</text>
  <text start="345.67" dur="4.05">them and the next day on the morrow</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="4.02">after they entered into Caesarea and</text>
  <text start="349.72" dur="4.17">Cornelius waited for them and had called</text>
  <text start="351.88" dur="4.71">together his kinsmen and near friends</text>
  <text start="353.89" dur="4.23">and as Peter was coming in Cornelius met</text>
  <text start="356.59" dur="3.54">him and fell down on his feet and</text>
  <text start="358.12" dur="4.44">worshiped him but Peter took him up</text>
  <text start="360.13" dur="5.22">saying stand up I myself am also just a</text>
  <text start="362.56" dur="4.8">man and as he walked and talked with him</text>
  <text start="365.35" dur="4.29">and went in and found many that will</text>
  <text start="367.36" dur="4.71">come together and he said unto them you</text>
  <text start="369.64" dur="5.19">know how that it is an unlawful thing</text>
  <text start="372.07" dur="6.39">for a man that is a Jew to keep company</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="6.54">of come unto one up or come unto one of</text>
  <text start="378.46" dur="3.78">another nation now what law is he</text>
  <text start="381.37" dur="3.57">talking about</text>
  <text start="382.24" dur="4.8">because in Torah we see in the book of</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="5">Exodus we see throughout the book of</text>
  <text start="387.04" dur="5.16">Jasher we see in Ruth we see examples of</text>
  <text start="389.94" dur="4.39">unclean if you will Gentiles of</text>
  <text start="392.2" dur="5.249">strangers coming into Israel so what is</text>
  <text start="394.33" dur="5.04">this law where a Jew can&amp;#39;t keep</text>
  <text start="397.449" dur="3.99">company with people who want to seek to</text>
  <text start="399.37" dur="4.289">be part of the Commonwealth with Israel</text>
  <text start="401.439" dur="4.62">well there is no law like that that is a</text>
  <text start="403.659" dur="3.72">man-made tradition okay</text>
  <text start="406.059" dur="4.14">and again that was the problem of the</text>
  <text start="407.379" dur="4.861">first century that the the leadership of</text>
  <text start="410.199" dur="5.61">the Jews had mixed all these man-made</text>
  <text start="412.24" dur="4.859">traditions with the Torah and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="415.809" dur="3.23">where the confusion was coming in so</text>
  <text start="417.099" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s why Peter thought it was unlawful</text>
  <text start="419.039" dur="7.72">but yah has shown me that I should not</text>
  <text start="422.439" dur="6.211">call any man common or unclean so now</text>
  <text start="426.759" dur="5.101">Peter right there in verse 28 he</text>
  <text start="428.65" dur="4.739">interprets this vision the she came down</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="4.109">three times with all these unclean</text>
  <text start="433.389" dur="5.46">animals yah said called nothing that</text>
  <text start="435.969" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;ve cleansed unclean there were three</text>
  <text start="438.849" dur="5.04">men at the gate and now Peter directly</text>
  <text start="441.219" dur="7.141">tells Cornelius yah show me not to call</text>
  <text start="443.889" dur="6.421">any man common or unclean right so</text>
  <text start="448.36" dur="3.6">basically what you I was doing is</text>
  <text start="450.31" dur="4.109">getting Peter back to the original</text>
  <text start="451.96" dur="4.049">written intent of the Torah that any man</text>
  <text start="454.419" dur="3.15">who desired to become part of the</text>
  <text start="456.009" dur="3.03">Commonwealth of Israel could if they</text>
  <text start="457.569" dur="3.18">were willing to walk in covenant with</text>
  <text start="459.039" dur="3.66">God they were willing to cleave unto yot</text>
  <text start="460.749" dur="4.681">they were willing to come under his</text>
  <text start="462.699" dur="4.05">blood his grace his covenant and then of</text>
  <text start="465.43" dur="3.03">course all those commandments and laws</text>
  <text start="466.749" dur="3.931">would then be applicable to them because</text>
  <text start="468.46" dur="4.289">we read in the last part in part to you</text>
  <text start="470.68" dur="3.69">about how there&amp;#39;s one law given to both</text>
  <text start="472.749" dur="3.45">the Gentile the stranger and the</text>
  <text start="474.37" dur="3.81">Israelite and in fact they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="476.199" dur="4.74">considered Gentiles anymore they&amp;#39;re now</text>
  <text start="478.18" dur="5.099">considered fellow Israelites that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="480.939" dur="4.861">it&amp;#39;s always working so all Yas doing an</text>
  <text start="483.279" dur="4.38">accent is reminding Peter of what the</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="4.199">Torah originally said and what its</text>
  <text start="487.659" dur="4.021">intent originally was to bring you know</text>
  <text start="489.999" dur="5.431">Israel is to be a light to the nation to</text>
  <text start="491.68" dur="5.579">bring all people into it and I believe</text>
  <text start="495.43" dur="3.12">that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re headed that by the</text>
  <text start="497.259" dur="3.571">time you get to the new heavens new</text>
  <text start="498.55" dur="4.079">earth there are twelve nations the</text>
  <text start="500.83" dur="4.319">twelve tribes of Israel everyone at that</text>
  <text start="502.629" dur="4.53">point has been that will repent and turn</text>
  <text start="505.149" dur="5">to him will be brought into Israel and</text>
  <text start="507.159" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;ll just be one Israel without end</text>
  <text start="510.149" dur="5.07">hallelujah</text>
  <text start="511.389" dur="5.731">Yahshua being the root and the head</text>
  <text start="515.219" dur="4">hallelujah</text>
  <text start="517.12" dur="5.729">so and then it just continues to go on</text>
  <text start="519.219" dur="5.251">about how Peter now understands that Yas</text>
  <text start="522.849" dur="3.691">not a respecter of persons which does</text>
  <text start="524.47" dur="3.93">should have understood this yah not</text>
  <text start="526.54" dur="3.66">being a respecter of persons</text>
  <text start="528.4" dur="4.32">this is all through the tour in the</text>
  <text start="530.2" dur="4.44">Tanakh it says Jana the same yesterday</text>
  <text start="532.72" dur="2.76">today and forever it says that in the in</text>
  <text start="534.64" dur="2.76">the Minor Prophets</text>
  <text start="535.48" dur="4.74">and of course we know that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="537.4" dur="4.2">himself the very image of yot he never</text>
  <text start="540.22" dur="4.08">changes he&amp;#39;s the same yesterday today</text>
  <text start="541.6" dur="4.739">and forever</text>
  <text start="544.3" dur="7.38">and so then it continues on about how</text>
  <text start="546.339" dur="6.601">wow this is amazing these Gentiles who</text>
  <text start="551.68" dur="2.73">want to become part of visual they can</text>
  <text start="552.94" dur="5.43">be fill with the Holy Spirit just as we</text>
  <text start="554.41" dur="7.83">can and so it continues on in that</text>
  <text start="558.37" dur="6.12">manner so this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="562.24" dur="5.16">being able to eat scorpions or spiders</text>
  <text start="564.49" dur="5.7">or snakes or pig or shellfish or</text>
  <text start="567.4" dur="5.04">anything unclean again yacht changes not</text>
  <text start="570.19" dur="4.38">so what he declared to be unclean way</text>
