  <text start="56.96" dur="4.39">there&amp;#39;s this question about police is</text>
  <text start="59.699" dur="4.32">the question I had and others have had</text>
  <text start="61.35" dur="4.74">this - if the son of perdition of the</text>
  <text start="64.019" dur="4.021">Antichrist the son of perdition is if</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="3.72">he&amp;#39;s ruling and reigning from Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="68.04" dur="2.91">and he makes his power center in</text>
  <text start="69.81" dur="4.53">Jerusalem which we read about in</text>
  <text start="70.95" dur="5.19">Revelation 11 then how is it that right</text>
  <text start="74.34" dur="4.65">before the time of the end when Messiah</text>
  <text start="76.14" dur="5.19">returns it says in Zechariah 14 that all</text>
  <text start="78.99" dur="3.39">these nations are coming up against</text>
  <text start="81.33" dur="3.48">Jerusalem and they&amp;#39;re attacking</text>

  <text start="84.81" dur="3.36">serving the son of perdition how is that</text>
  <text start="86.939" dur="3.75">all these armies are coming against</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="4.92">Jerusalem well that&amp;#39;s a good question</text>
  <text start="90.689" dur="6.241">so we need to look at Daniel chapter 11</text>
  <text start="93.09" dur="5.31">Zechariah 14 revelation 11 revelation 19</text>
  <text start="96.93" dur="4.049">and a host of other scriptures we got to</text>
  <text start="98.4" dur="4.8">piece it all together to make this work</text>
  <text start="100.979" dur="4.201">so I&amp;#39;ve made a host of other teachings</text>

  <text start="149.349" dur="5.22">Paul Tolls very clearly who was and who</text>
  <text start="152.049" dur="3.66">is the son of perdition thousands of</text>
  <text start="154.569" dur="3.151">years before any of us were born that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="164.319" dur="3.78">sit in the temple declaring himself</text>
  <text start="165.639" dur="3.75">Yahoo will pollute that temple he will</text>
  <text start="168.099" dur="3.181">have a glory cloud we&amp;#39;ll be able to call</text>
  <text start="169.389" dur="4.651">down fire from the sky and it says very</text>
  <text start="171.28" dur="4.829">clearly in that letter that rabbi shai</text>
  <text start="174.04" dur="4.169">will Apostle Paul wrote to the vessel of</text>
  <text start="176.109" dur="3.901">knighthood believers that he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="178.209" dur="3.93">do this and it says very clearly in</text>
  <text start="180.01" dur="3.809">revelation 11 that the son of perdition</text>
  <text start="182.139" dur="3.24">is ruling and Ray he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="183.819" dur="2.971">counterfeit the Millenium he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="185.379" dur="3.961">counterfeit what&amp;#39;s eventually gonna</text>
  <text start="186.79" dur="5.309">happen when the real Messiah returns and</text>
  <text start="189.34" dur="6.45">so he sets up shop in this temple in</text>
  <text start="192.099" dur="5.401">Jerusalem so he&amp;#39;s in Jerusalem the</text>
  <text start="195.79" dur="3.27">supper dish is in Jerusalem and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.5" dur="5.879">ruling and reigning there and it says</text>
  <text start="199.06" dur="6.359">his reign is 42 months ok and he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.379" dur="4.2">basically ruling from the temple I think</text>
  <text start="205.419" dur="3.69">he&amp;#39;s gonna actually sit on the Ark of</text>
  <text start="207.579" dur="2.701">the Covenant mark tailors talked about</text>
  <text start="209.109" dur="2.701">how this artifacts going to be</text>
  <text start="210.28" dur="2.94">discovered I think they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="211.81" dur="3.149">discover the Ark of the Covenant there I</text>
  <text start="213.22" dur="4.379">think that they&amp;#39;re in or does Ron Wyatt</text>
  <text start="214.959" dur="4.291">found it it&amp;#39;s beneath Jerusalem but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.599" dur="3.181">gonna actually be able to sit on it and</text>
  <text start="219.25" dur="4.139">it&amp;#39;s going to be part of the great</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="4.62">delusion because remember in Jeremiah 3</text>
  <text start="223.389" dur="5.52">it says when we get to the real</text>
  <text start="225.4" dur="4.619">Millennial Kingdom 3 Jeremiah 3:16 the</text>
  <text start="228.909" dur="2.851">Ark of the Covenant won&amp;#39;t even be</text>
  <text start="230.019" dur="4.741">mentioned it&amp;#39;ll be forgotten because</text>
  <text start="231.76" dur="4.349">Yahshua he&amp;#39;s the Ark but this heart of</text>
  <text start="234.76" dur="3.509">the Covenant will be brought out and the</text>
  <text start="236.109" dur="4.171">son of perdition will sit on it and he</text>
  <text start="238.269" dur="3.601">will control Jerusalem he will rule the</text>
  <text start="240.28" dur="4.65">world and there&amp;#39;ll be 10 nations</text>
  <text start="241.87" dur="4.41">underneath him three of those nations</text>
  <text start="244.93" dur="4.29">will be uprooted to write the very</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="5.34">beginning the United States France and</text>
  <text start="249.22" dur="3.659">England and there&amp;#39;s a reason why France</text>
  <text start="251.62" dur="4.56">is going through all this transformation</text>
  <text start="252.879" dur="5.491">right now because France the UK and the</text>
  <text start="256.18" dur="6.93">United States those creations are going</text>
  <text start="258.37" dur="7.319">to become very anti anti pedophile</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="4.35">anteye Satanist anti-globalist believe</text>
  <text start="265.689" dur="3.51">it or not perhaps the UK and the United</text>
  <text start="267.46" dur="3.239">States and that&amp;#39;s why the celebration is</text>
  <text start="269.199" dur="3.661">going to uproot them the very beginning</text>
  <text start="270.699" dur="3.69">of the Great Tribulation which I</text>
  <text start="272.86" dur="4.38">personally believe is going to be in</text>
  <text start="274.389" dur="4.59">2024 but we&amp;#39;ll see but the variance</text>
  <text start="277.24" dur="4.26">relation three of those ones are brutes</text>
  <text start="278.979" dur="3.99">you got seven seven nations left and</text>
  <text start="281.5" dur="5.039">have those seven nations they&amp;#39;ll be 10</text>
  <text start="282.969" dur="5.19">Kings and Israel will be ruling over all</text>
  <text start="286.539" dur="4.981">those seven nations ruling over the</text>
  <text start="288.159" dur="5.22">world well China and Russia they got</text>
  <text start="291.52" dur="3.239">badly hit at the very beginning of Great</text>
  <text start="293.379" dur="3.81">Tribulation when they attack the United</text>
  <text start="294.759" dur="5.19">States try and rest are licking their</text>
  <text start="297.189" dur="6.151">wounds they do not like to serve Israel</text>
  <text start="299.949" dur="5.4">no way so we read in Daniel 11 that the</text>
  <text start="303.34" dur="3.78">son of perdition right toward the end of</text>
  <text start="305.349" dur="3.63">the Great Tribulation right for the end</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="4.169">of his forty-two month reign we read</text>
  <text start="308.979" dur="5.4">that he hears these bad tidings from the</text>
  <text start="311.289" dur="4.921">north and from the east of course rushes</text>
  <text start="314.379" dur="3.63">to the north of Israel and Chinese to</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="4.109">the east and it says that this son of</text>
  <text start="318.009" dur="4.4">perdition goes out and just destroys</text>
  <text start="320.319" dur="4.32">them I mean just takes him out just</text>
  <text start="322.409" dur="5.141">remember the set of predictions anointed</text>
  <text start="324.639" dur="6.18">with I mean yah Himself allows this guy</text>
  <text start="327.55" dur="4.979">to be an instrument to delude all those</text>
  <text start="330.819" dur="3.301">who have not a love for the truth says</text>
  <text start="332.529" dur="3.991">that very clearly in the second</text>
  <text start="334.12" dur="3.87">Thessalonians chapter 2 so he&amp;#39;s able to</text>
  <text start="336.52" dur="3.329">pull down fire from the sky he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="337.99" dur="3.72">controlling the world so he totally</text>
  <text start="339.849" dur="3.481">decimates Russia and China at that point</text>
  <text start="341.71" dur="4.47">this is right for the the end of the</text>
  <text start="343.33" dur="4.769">Great Tribulation but then what happens</text>
  <text start="346.18" dur="4.229">is is you know these two witnesses</text>
  <text start="348.099" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;ve been preaching for three and a</text>
  <text start="350.409" dur="3.331">half years the same three and a half</text>
  <text start="351.969" dur="3.841">years 42 months this is some perdition&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.74" dur="3.239">and raining all the world hates these</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="3.359">two witnesses because these two</text>
  <text start="356.979" dur="3.84">witnesses are preaching the gospel to</text>
  <text start="359.169" dur="3.691">Messiah I mean they are preaching repent</text>
  <text start="360.819" dur="3.87">and turn to Yahshua and they&amp;#39;re even</text>
  <text start="362.86" dur="3.479">calling downplays I mean they&amp;#39;re turning</text>
  <text start="364.689" dur="3.961">water to blood they&amp;#39;re shutting up the</text>
  <text start="366.339" dur="3.51">sky they these two guys and if you</text>
  <text start="368.65" dur="3">haven&amp;#39;t seen my teaching on the two</text>
  <text start="369.849" dur="3.93">witnesses please go ask that as well but</text>
  <text start="371.65" dur="3.87">these two do two guys are preaching for</text>
  <text start="373.779" dur="4.2">1260 days and then right at the end of</text>
  <text start="375.52" dur="3.899">their testimony it says that the son of</text>
  <text start="377.979" dur="3.481">perdition the beast they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="379.419" dur="3.93">murder the two witnesses and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="381.46" dur="4.29">murdered they are killed and destroyed</text>
  <text start="383.349" dur="4.68">and murdered right there in the streets</text>
  <text start="385.75" dur="4.469">of Jerusalem and it says all the world</text>
  <text start="388.029" dur="3.821">rejoices are like yes these two guys are</text>
  <text start="390.219" dur="3.761">dead hallelujah</text>
  <text start="391.85" dur="3.78">yeah because they think most the world</text>
  <text start="393.98" dur="4.89">at this point they think the sudden</text>
  <text start="395.63" dur="4.83">traditions the real Messiah so these two</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="3.78">witnesses like to end the streets for</text>
  <text start="400.46" dur="4.98">three and a half days and this is going</text>
  <text start="402.65" dur="4.89">to be on some future yom teruah and the</text>
  <text start="405.44" dur="4.08">days of the seventh trumpet if it talks</text>
  <text start="407.54" dur="3.75">about revelation 10 relation 11 and</text>
  <text start="409.52" dur="3.9">those days is the seventh trumpet happen</text>
  <text start="411.29" dur="3.96">every year between the Feast of Trumpets</text>
  <text start="413.42" dur="3.84">and yom kippur it&amp;#39;s a 10-day period</text>
  <text start="415.25" dur="3.39">known as the days of all the days of the</text>
  <text start="417.26" dur="2.91">seventh trumpet so we never know the day</text>
  <text start="418.64" dur="4.11">or the hour when that rash or a</text>
  <text start="420.17" dur="6.09">resurrection can occur but at some point</text>
  <text start="422.75" dur="5.25">after that 1260 days down on the days of</text>
  <text start="426.26" dur="3.96">the seventh trumpet those two witnesses</text>
  <text start="428" dur="3.45">after lying in the streets of Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="430.22" dur="2.67">for three night days they&amp;#39;re gonna rise</text>
  <text start="431.45" dur="4.11">up they&amp;#39;re gonna get up on their feet</text>
  <text start="432.89" dur="5.04">and resurrect just like all the dead</text>
  <text start="435.56" dur="3.93">Messiah will resurrect and then we who</text>
  <text start="437.93" dur="3.09">are alive remain will be get caught up</text>
  <text start="439.49" dur="3.78">with them but they&amp;#39;re gonna resurrect</text>
  <text start="441.02" dur="4.14">and it says when they resurrect this</text>
  <text start="443.27" dur="3.36">great fear falls upon all of the</text>
  <text start="445.16" dur="4.14">citizens of Jerusalem because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="446.63" dur="5.43">like what that and it says this huge</text>
  <text start="449.3" dur="4.59">earthquake occurs where seven thousand</text>
  <text start="452.06" dur="3.81">are killed in Jerusalem and the rest</text>
  <text start="453.89" dur="3.72">repent there&amp;#39;s a revival there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="455.87" dur="3.96">action as they see the resurrection</text>
  <text start="457.61" dur="5.31">occur the rapture core is a revival</text>
  <text start="459.83" dur="5.43">finally in Jerusalem and in fact it</text>
  <text start="462.92" dur="5.34">talks about this in Romans 11 where it</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="5.67">says that you know the resurrection of</text>
  <text start="468.26" dur="4.02">the Dead will be life to the Jews so so</text>
  <text start="470.93" dur="3.87">this huge earthquake happens well this</text>
  <text start="472.28" dur="5.01">earthquake destroys the center</text>
  <text start="474.8" dur="4.77">perdition&amp;#39;s temple and also all those</text>
  <text start="477.29" dur="3.75">people that were in Jerusalem they</text>
  <text start="479.57" dur="3.15">hadn&amp;#39;t taken the mark of the beast yet</text>
  <text start="481.04" dur="3.27">but they&amp;#39;re in Jerusalem there now</text>
  <text start="482.72" dur="3.36">repenting that they&amp;#39;re getting glory yah</text>
  <text start="484.31" dur="3.24">they missed the rapture they missed the</text>
  <text start="486.08" dur="5.28">resurrection but they&amp;#39;re giving glory to</text>
  <text start="487.55" dur="5.91">God so the son of perdition is he leaves</text>
  <text start="491.36" dur="5.07">Jerusalem because his temples now been</text>
  <text start="493.46" dur="5.97">destroyed by that huge earthquake and he</text>
  <text start="496.43" dur="4.98">leaves and in Daniel 11 we find out why</text>
  <text start="499.43" dur="4.41">where he goes it says he plants a</text>

  <text start="663.43" dur="5.22">his coming and he melts the the the all</text>
  <text start="667.03" dur="2.88">those who took the mark of the beast and</text>
  <text start="668.65" dur="4.26">all the armor and there there</text>
  <text start="669.91" dur="5.58">obliterated destroyed and Satan himself</text>
  <text start="672.91" dur="4.41">The Devil&amp;#39;s that are consuming the son</text>
  <text start="675.49" dur="2.88">of perdition and leave him there thrown</text>
  <text start="677.32" dur="3.18">to the bottomless pit</text>
  <text start="678.37" dur="5.52">for a thousand years so they can&amp;#39;t walk</text>
  <text start="680.5" dur="5.22">on the earth anymore says Yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="683.89" dur="3.69">after hour 14 then touches down on the</text>
  <text start="685.72" dur="4.41">Mount of Olives which is just east of</text>
  <text start="687.58" dur="3.87">the temple that&amp;#39;s been destroyed he</text>
  <text start="690.13" dur="2.73">touches down the Mount of Olives and</text>
  <text start="691.45" dur="4.65">then there&amp;#39;s another earthquake where</text>
  <text start="692.86" dur="6.93">them all of the stuff splits open okay</text>
  <text start="696.1" dur="6.48">and it says in Revelation all the cities</text>
  <text start="699.79" dur="4.77">of the earth crumble I mean it&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="702.58" dur="3.27">earthquake this time and we return with</text>
  <text start="704.56" dur="4.23">him all right</text>
  <text start="705.85" dur="5.28">and now all those who took the mark of</text>
  <text start="708.79" dur="4.05">the beast are there destroyed most of</text>
  <text start="711.13" dur="4.05">the Earth&amp;#39;s populations gone but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="712.84" dur="4.08">still a few people who they did not take</text>
  <text start="715.18" dur="3.18">the mark of the beast but they also miss</text>
  <text start="716.92" dur="3.6">the resurrection of that seventh trumpet</text>
  <text start="718.36" dur="6.09">resurrection and those are the remnant</text>
  <text start="720.52" dur="5.28">the survivors who now they are the ones</text>
  <text start="724.45" dur="4.68">that are gonna be repopulating the earth</text>
  <text start="725.8" dur="5.01">over the next thousand years so I hope</text>
  <text start="729.13" dur="3.6">this person in perspective and answers</text>
  <text start="730.81" dur="3.63">the question as to why those armies are</text>
  <text start="732.73" dur="3.03">surrounding Jerusalem and obviously when</text>
  <text start="734.44" dur="3.39">we gossiped touches down all these</text>
  <text start="735.76" dur="3.69">armies says they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="737.83" dur="3.54">destroyed just like all these armies</text>
  <text start="739.45" dur="4.59">work okay they&amp;#39;re all destroyed and</text>
  <text start="741.37" dur="4.44">those who remain it says of the nations</text>
  <text start="744.04" dur="4.77">that are left that did not come up</text>
  <text start="745.81" dur="4.32">against Jerusalem they will be commanded</text>
  <text start="748.81" dur="3.72">from year-to-year to go up to Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="750.13" dur="4.35">to keep the Peace of Sukkot Tabernacles</text>
  <text start="752.53" dur="4.2">and that&amp;#39;s the commandment for a</text>
  <text start="754.48" dur="4.08">thousand years and those nations who do</text>
  <text start="756.73" dur="4.38">not come up during that values they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="758.56" dur="4.41">receive no rain so they&amp;#39;ll still be some</text>
  <text start="761.11" dur="4.14">pockets of sin and rebellion even with</text>
  <text start="762.97" dur="3.8">Jesus ruling and reigning and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="765.25" dur="4.83">ruling and reigning with them in our</text>
  <text start="766.77" dur="4.57">resurrected angelic bodies they&amp;#39;ll still</text>
  <text start="770.08" dur="2.43">be pockets because they&amp;#39;ll still be</text>
  <text start="771.34" dur="3.75">nations say now I&amp;#39;m not going to go up</text>
  <text start="772.51" dur="5.01">and that&amp;#39;s why Satan is really released</text>
  <text start="775.09" dur="5.58">at the you know after the thousand-year</text>
  <text start="777.52" dur="5.04">reign and he goes down tempts all these</text>
  <text start="780.67" dur="2.9">people that came out for a thousand</text>
  <text start="782.56" dur="2.3">years you&amp;#39;ve had this</text>
  <text start="783.57" dur="3.33">the population that survived now</text>
  <text start="784.86" dur="3.87">populating the earth you&amp;#39;ve had no wars</text>
  <text start="786.9" dur="3.51">you have Joshua ruling and reigning a</text>
  <text start="788.73" dur="3.63">perfect government the devil is not</text>
  <text start="790.41" dur="3.78">there peoples living longer it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="792.36" dur="3.9">beautiful world so you know you have a</text>
  <text start="794.19" dur="3.33">population of trillions and trillions of</text>
  <text start="796.26" dur="2.7">trans people and Satan is able to</text>
  <text start="797.52" dur="4.5">deceive those people a lot of those</text>
  <text start="798.96" dur="4.98">people and they again try to come</text>
  <text start="802.02" dur="3.47">against the the camp of the saints</text>
  <text start="803.94" dur="3.75">rissalah but of course god this</text>
  <text start="805.49" dur="3.58">instantly destroys them with fire and</text>
  <text start="807.69" dur="2.67">then we have the white throne judgment</text>
  <text start="809.07" dur="2.4">and then the new heavens new earth I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="810.36" dur="2.58">not gonna give it an axe I&amp;#39;ve done that</text>
  <text start="811.47" dur="3.9">in other teachings but hopefully this</text>
  <text start="812.94" dur="3.66">explains sort of the progression of</text>
  <text start="815.37" dur="3.72">events of the son of perdition</text>
  <text start="816.6" dur="4.29">and and and why he&amp;#39;s not in Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="819.09" dur="4.32">why the nations come against it all that</text>
  <text start="820.89" dur="5.16">so again discuss from Daniel chapter 11</text>
  <text start="823.41" dur="5.79">it comes from Zechariah 14</text>
  <text start="826.05" dur="6.27">it comes from revelation 11 10 11 and</text>
  <text start="829.2" dur="4.62">revelation 19 and 20 and 21 and a bunch</text>
  <text start="832.32" dur="2.73">of other different minor prophets that I</text>
  <text start="833.82" dur="3.09">pieced together too but those are the</text>
  <text start="835.05" dur="3.69">main things so I hope this blessed you</text>
  <text start="836.91" dur="5.54">it&amp;#39;s time for me to go outside and do a</text>
  <text start="838.74" dur="3.71">Shabbat I survive Salome</text>
