  <text start="315.219" dur="5.85">broken over your sin and he fills you</text>
  <text start="318.159" dur="5.22">with his spirit and use the light to do</text>
  <text start="321.069" dur="7.051">this book you delight to do His</text>
  <text start="323.379" dur="8.701">commandments my testimony is this I was</text>
  <text start="328.12" dur="6.06">raised in the church down in Texas and I</text>
  <text start="332.08" dur="3.69">was just kind of going there as that was</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="3.18">what my family did you know every day</text>
  <text start="335.77" dur="3.869">everyone down at Texas claims to be a</text>
  <text start="337.36" dur="4.95">Christian I was just going through the</text>
  <text start="339.639" dur="4.111">motions but I didn&amp;#39;t really like this I</text>
  <text start="342.31" dur="3.509">was still living instead I was still</text>
  <text start="343.75" dur="4.77">doing things that I knew were wrong and</text>
  <text start="345.819" dur="5.34">then one day this very fiery evangelist</text>
  <text start="348.52" dur="4.109">came to our church and he started</text>
  <text start="351.159" dur="4.891">actually preaching from this book at</text>
  <text start="352.629" dur="6.181">first John that you cannot be living in</text>
  <text start="356.05" dur="5.489">sin if you love him you claim do to</text>
  <text start="358.81" dur="4.759">really love him and it convinces me hard</text>
  <text start="361.539" dur="7.981">and I realized all my religious</text>
  <text start="363.569" dur="8.171">trappings were a phony lot and so for it</text>
  <text start="369.52" dur="5.609">was weeks for I think it was almost a</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="6.389">month I was in a lot of warning and just</text>
  <text start="375.129" dur="5.97">like oh god no please help me seeking</text>
  <text start="378.129" dur="5.431">him out praying for him praying that he</text>
  <text start="381.099" dur="4.891">would come in and tear down all my phony</text>
  <text start="383.56" dur="5.849">religion and actually that I could grab</text>
  <text start="385.99" dur="5.909">ahold of him and one day I was sitting</text>
  <text start="389.409" dur="4.74">on a bench it was that during my lunch</text>
  <text start="391.899" dur="4.83">hour I just graduated from high school</text>
  <text start="394.149" dur="4.38">is that my first job and I was sitting</text>
  <text start="396.729" dur="4.891">on a bench and I was reading in</text>
  <text start="398.529" dur="5.431">Philippians where it says to live is</text>
  <text start="401.62" dur="4.829">Christ what to die is gain</text>
  <text start="403.96" dur="5.04">and those words to live is Christ they</text>
  <text start="406.449" dur="5.911">burn like fire in my mind and in my</text>
  <text start="409" dur="5.789">heart and I realized it was no longer me</text>
  <text start="412.36" dur="5.459">that was doing this but it was Christ</text>
  <text start="414.789" dur="5.581">who is living deep within me he would</text>
  <text start="417.819" dur="5.311">enable me to obey him he would enable me</text>
  <text start="420.37" dur="4.74">to love him he would enable me to keep</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="3.599">his Commandments and I had that</text>
  <text start="425.11" dur="4.32">revelation and then all of a sudden my</text>
  <text start="426.729" dur="5.521">count has changed and I realized I had</text>
  <text start="429.43" dur="5.16">truly met the Messiah when you truly</text>
  <text start="432.25" dur="4.919">meet the Messiah he will fill you from</text>
  <text start="434.59" dur="5.34">your innermost being and he will allow</text>
  <text start="437.169" dur="5.97">you to walk in His commandments he will</text>
  <text start="439.93" dur="5.519">help you every day that&amp;#39;s why he came in</text>
  <text start="443.139" dur="4.081">the flesh by the way he came in the</text>
  <text start="445.449" dur="4.081">flesh because he was tempted in every</text>
  <text start="447.22" dur="5.539">way that we get tempted every single way</text>
  <text start="449.53" dur="7.05">yet he never yielded the sin not once</text>
  <text start="452.759" dur="6.13">not once so when we repent and we turned</text>
  <text start="456.58" dur="4.41">to him and he feels it was his Spirit we</text>
  <text start="458.889" dur="4.68">get tempted his spirit continent says</text>
  <text start="460.99" dur="6.87">hey I have overcome this I can help you</text>
  <text start="463.569" dur="6.871">overcome this as well yes if we trust in</text>
  <text start="467.86" dur="5.66">him if we make him our King if he is</text>
  <text start="470.44" dur="7.5">living with us he enables us to resist</text>
  <text start="473.52" dur="5.889">and that&amp;#39;s why he came in the flesh he</text>
  <text start="477.94" dur="4.199">also came in the flesh because He shed</text>
  <text start="479.409" dur="4.711">his blood because there&amp;#39;s nothing we can</text>
  <text start="482.139" dur="4.921">do for all the past sins that we&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="484.12" dur="6.889">we all deserve but like a fire we all</text>
  <text start="487.06" dur="6.329">deserve a turtle death all of us do</text>
  <text start="491.009" dur="4.331">nothing we can do about that even if we</text>
  <text start="493.389" dur="3.421">were to live everything perfectly that</text>
  <text start="495.34" dur="4.74">still does not absolve as we did in the</text>
  <text start="496.81" dur="5.25">past so that&amp;#39;s why we need is blood his</text>
  <text start="500.08" dur="3.839">blood which is powerful more powerful</text>
  <text start="502.06" dur="5.42">than the blood of bulls and goats his</text>
  <text start="503.919" dur="5.931">blood that cleared the passions</text>
  <text start="507.48" dur="3.72">so we get his blood he shed his blood so</text>
  <text start="509.85" dur="3.21">that we would have a clean conscience</text>
  <text start="511.2" dur="4.71">that we no longer be burdened by what we</text>
  <text start="513.06" dur="5.64">did in the past and then we get his</text>
  <text start="515.91" dur="6.45">spirit his spirit which enables us to</text>
  <text start="518.7" dur="8.55">walk in His commandments to walk in his</text>
  <text start="522.36" dur="6.87">ways we need both we need his spirit we</text>
  <text start="527.25" dur="4.17">need his blood cleanse us from our sin</text>
  <text start="529.23" dur="4.83">and we need his spirit to walk in his</text>
  <text start="531.42" dur="5.61">ways because like what he told the woman</text>
  <text start="534.06" dur="5.79">caught in adultery he said that woman it</text>
  <text start="537.03" dur="5.49">was broken and he she realized that she</text>
  <text start="539.85" dur="5.55">was completely exposing her sin Yahshua</text>
  <text start="542.52" dur="7.95">lift her up to her feet and he said go</text>
  <text start="545.4" dur="6.84">and sin no more go and sin no more</text>
  <text start="550.47" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s the message that Messiah is</text>
  <text start="552.24" dur="7.47">telling all of you saying go and sin no</text>
  <text start="555.9" dur="7.25">more anyway you can go and sin no more</text>
  <text start="559.71" dur="7.11">is through him that&amp;#39;s why we need him</text>
  <text start="563.15" dur="6.52">that&amp;#39;s the true power of the Messiah</text>
  <text start="566.82" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s the resurrecting power if I go</text>
  <text start="569.67" dur="4.86">around and I go yeah he&amp;#39;s great and</text>
  <text start="572.25" dur="4.89">wonderful pure but I&amp;#39;m still living in</text>
  <text start="574.53" dur="4.26">sin I&amp;#39;m looking at pornography or I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="577.14" dur="3.99">flying or I&amp;#39;m cheating I just think</text>
  <text start="578.79" dur="5.85">where&amp;#39;s the power there&amp;#39;s no power in</text>
  <text start="581.13" dur="7.02">that but I would anyone want to serve</text>
  <text start="584.64" dur="5.7">them aside leaves me in sin the Bible</text>
  <text start="588.15" dur="7.73">says whomsoever the son sets free is</text>
  <text start="590.34" dur="5.54">free indeed it&amp;#39;s very indeed</text>
