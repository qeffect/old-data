  <text start="17.97" dur="6.479">I love the rain I love hearing the rain</text>
  <text start="20.27" dur="8.74">pitter-patter down on the on the rocks</text>
  <text start="24.449" dur="9.211">and the water Oh to me this is just like</text>
  <text start="29.01" dur="7.44">the perfect way to keep Shabbat so I</text>
  <text start="33.66" dur="4.41">have a plan and this actually I have to</text>
  <text start="36.45" dur="4.199">thank a subscriber for suggesting this</text>
  <text start="38.07" dur="5.64">but when I did my video last Shabbat a</text>
  <text start="40.649" dur="4.471">week ago this morning and I addressed</text>
  <text start="43.71" dur="2.81">all the false allegations against me</text>
  <text start="45.12" dur="4.439">someone mentioned well why don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="46.52" dur="5.14">expose this judge who took your children</text>
  <text start="49.559" dur="3.511">from you and I thought wow that&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="51.66" dur="3.51">idea in fact I had had that idea a</text>
  <text start="53.07" dur="4.35">couple years ago but then I have to</text>
  <text start="55.17" dur="4.29">confess I sort of allowed fear to rule</text>
  <text start="57.42" dur="3.45">me and I was afraid if I did this idea</text>
  <text start="59.46" dur="4.32">it would it would get me in trouble but</text>
  <text start="60.87" dur="5.91">I&amp;#39;m ruled by love now and and should</text>
  <text start="63.78" dur="5.07">always be ruled by love and so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="66.78" dur="5.1">reminded of this parable in the</text>
  <text start="68.85" dur="6.93">scriptures that Jesus Yahshua taught and</text>
  <text start="71.88" dur="6.599">he said that there was a widow who she</text>
  <text start="75.78" dur="4.199">had been treated unfairly and she would</text>
  <text start="78.479" dur="3.271">kept going to this judge and this judge</text>
  <text start="79.979" dur="3.301">was unjust this judge was not a good</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="3.869">person but the widow kept persisting</text>
  <text start="83.28" dur="4.08">over and over and over again making her</text>
  <text start="85.619" dur="3.271">request to the judge and eventually the</text>
  <text start="87.36" dur="3.78">judge got so sick and tired of this</text>
  <text start="88.89" dur="3.54">woman bugging him that he granted her</text>
  <text start="91.14" dur="3.96">request so I thought well why don&amp;#39;t I do</text>
  <text start="92.43" dur="5.91">that with Judge Susan L nor be from</text>
  <text start="95.1" dur="5.309">Clackamas County she&amp;#39;s the one who six</text>
  <text start="98.34" dur="4.889">years ago almost six years ago to the</text>
  <text start="100.409" dur="4.951">day was October 30 2012 where she</text>
  <text start="103.229" dur="4.381">unjustly and wickedly cut me off for my</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="3.75">children you know I&amp;#39;m not saying she&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="3.45">pedophile but she definitely seems to be</text>
  <text start="109.11" dur="4.259">like a Luciferian a satanic plant</text>
  <text start="111.06" dur="5.339">because when I first walked into the</text>
  <text start="113.369" dur="5.131">courtroom on October 30th 2012 the first</text>
  <text start="116.399" dur="3.601">thing she said to me is she looked at my</text>
  <text start="118.5" dur="4.409">Bible that I was holding she said this</text>
  <text start="120" dur="4.35">courtroom is not based on that book so</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="3.71">she let me know right off the bat that</text>
  <text start="124.35" dur="5.189">she was going to treat me as an enemy</text>
  <text start="126.619" dur="4.671">Susan L nor B I did some research on her</text>
  <text start="129.539" dur="3.971">just recently earlier this year</text>
  <text start="131.29" dur="3.36">got trapped in her own courtroom late at</text>
  <text start="133.51" dur="5.339">night when she was there working on</text>
  <text start="134.65" dur="6.169">stuff and she had to use like a piece of</text>
  <text start="138.849" dur="8.22">the courtroom to bust the door open</text>
  <text start="140.819" dur="8.711">anyway here&amp;#39;s my idea I want to urge all</text>
  <text start="147.069" dur="4.831">of you to help me send an avalanche of</text>
  <text start="149.53" dur="6.329">letters to Judge Susan norbi who made</text>
  <text start="151.9" dur="5.55">this unjust decision six years ago now</text>
  <text start="155.859" dur="3.541">people say Daniel why don&amp;#39;t you go be</text>
  <text start="157.45" dur="4.73">with your children why don&amp;#39;t focus I</text>
  <text start="159.4" dur="4.949">can&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t you think I&amp;#39;d want to III</text>
  <text start="162.18" dur="5.5">I&amp;#39;ve been weeping and praying for them</text>
  <text start="164.349" dur="5.941">for years and before that before 2012 I</text>
  <text start="167.68" dur="4.559">mean my ex-wife divorced me 2009 for</text>
  <text start="170.29" dur="3.479">three or four years I waged custody</text>
  <text start="172.239" dur="4.231">battle after custody about alpha custody</text>
  <text start="173.769" dur="4.021">battle and then it ended then and when I</text>
  <text start="176.47" dur="3.269">went to my father&amp;#39;s rights attorney he</text>
  <text start="177.79" dur="4.08">said it would be a $10,000 retainer just</text>
  <text start="179.739" dur="3.631">to fight that I mean it was like I did</text>
  <text start="181.87" dur="3.209">all I could and I&amp;#39;ve been praying I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="183.37" dur="3.6">been weeping daily for my children at</text>
  <text start="185.079" dur="6.99">you some of you don&amp;#39;t understand that I</text>
  <text start="186.97" dur="6.719">love them so much but here&amp;#39;s my idea I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="255.29" dur="3.75">on my children you still made this</text>
  <text start="256.549" dur="4.261">decision in the Bible there was a story</text>
  <text start="259.04" dur="3.69">about a persistent widow who begs the</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="4.26">judge every day to intervene on her</text>

  <text start="491.889" dur="5.041">just thought of something I just thought</text>
  <text start="495.52" dur="4.579">of something just to go along with that</text>
  <text start="496.93" dur="3.169">beautiful scripture</text>
  <text start="507.58" dur="9.75">or is it there&amp;#39;s a scripture in the</text>
  <text start="514" dur="5.97">beginning of Luke that says and it was</text>
  <text start="517.33" dur="4.97">customary as it was Jesus&amp;#39;s or Yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="519.97" dur="3.57">custom to go to synagogue on Sabbath oh</text>
  <text start="522.3" dur="3.94">yeah</text>
  <text start="523.54" dur="5.19">Luke 6 just for those of you who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="526.24" dur="3.72">believe the Messiah did keep Shabbat and</text>
  <text start="528.73" dur="3.56">we&amp;#39;re supposed to be like Messiah right</text>
  <text start="529.96" dur="4.68">and it came to pass on the second</text>
  <text start="532.29" dur="4.54">Sabbath after the 1st that he went</text>
  <text start="534.64" dur="3.84">through the cornfields oh that&amp;#39;s when he</text>
  <text start="536.83" dur="4.05">went through the cornfields well this is</text>
  <text start="538.48" dur="4.68">another good story see the Pharisees had</text>
  <text start="540.88" dur="3.93">designed their own wicked Talmud oral</text>
  <text start="543.16" dur="3.33">laws that said you couldn&amp;#39;t plug ears of</text>
  <text start="544.81" dur="4.2">corn on a Shabbat the tour the written</text>
  <text start="546.49" dur="4.17">Torah doesn&amp;#39;t doesn&amp;#39;t say that you can</text>
  <text start="549.01" dur="3.24">you can walk through a field and pick</text>
  <text start="550.66" dur="4.14">some kernels of corn to eat of course</text>
  <text start="552.25" dur="3.96">you can but the Pharisees and Sadducees</text>
  <text start="554.8" dur="2.52">a lot of them had made these oral</text>
  <text start="556.21" dur="3.57">traditions and that&amp;#39;s why they tried to</text>
  <text start="557.32" dur="3.42">condemn Yahshua but of course they</text>
  <text start="559.78" dur="4.35">couldn&amp;#39;t because he wasn&amp;#39;t breaking</text>
  <text start="560.74" dur="4.8">Torah now there&amp;#39;s a scripture and I</text>
  <text start="564.13" dur="2.58">think it&amp;#39;s Luke before somewhere where</text>
  <text start="565.54" dur="6.99">it&amp;#39;s talks about how and it was</text>
  <text start="566.71" dur="8.13">customary for Yahshua for Jesus to oh my</text>
  <text start="572.53" dur="8.27">is this blurry come on</text>
