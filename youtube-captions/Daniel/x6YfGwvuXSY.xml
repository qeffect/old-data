  <text start="0.11" dur="7.33">this is an article that I wrote this</text>
  <text start="3.03" dur="6.84">evening honest the 14 2014 Robin</text>
  <text start="7.44" dur="3.69">Williams and his final selfish act and</text>
  <text start="9.87" dur="4.32">everything that&amp;#39;s wrong with this</text>
  <text start="11.13" dur="5.399">culture as a Bible believer the selfish</text>
  <text start="14.19" dur="4.8">suicide Robin Williams has sickened me</text>
  <text start="16.529" dur="4.201">but what is sickened me even more is how</text>
  <text start="18.99" dur="4.02">the culture and media have responded to</text>
  <text start="20.73" dur="4.26">it because the Bible shapes my worldview</text>
  <text start="23.01" dur="5.07">I accept the reality that suicide is</text>
  <text start="24.99" dur="5.58">murder the murdering of oneself it is a</text>
  <text start="28.08" dur="5.28">heinous act cowardly selfish and</text>
  <text start="30.57" dur="4.47">completely sinful suicide is spoken of</text>
  <text start="33.36" dur="4.08">on more than one occasion throughout the</text>
  <text start="35.04" dur="4.74">biblical text and always shows it to be</text>
  <text start="37.44" dur="5.1">a horrible unforgivable act of sin in</text>
  <text start="39.78" dur="5.279">fact in many ways suicide is worse than</text>
  <text start="42.54" dur="4.47">murdering someone else after all it is</text>
  <text start="45.059" dur="4.32">within the realm of possibility that if</text>
  <text start="47.01" dur="4.17">a person chooses to murder another that</text>
  <text start="49.379" dur="4.231">murderer could perhaps still find</text>
  <text start="51.18" dur="4.949">salvation at a later time and repent of</text>
  <text start="53.61" dur="4.859">his actions not so the murder of one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="56.129" dur="4.86">own self if ever there was an important</text>
  <text start="58.469" dur="4.531">bill sin it is suicide when a person</text>
  <text start="60.989" dur="3.721">chooses to murder himself he literally</text>
  <text start="63" dur="3.9">dies in the act of committing a sin</text>
  <text start="64.71" dur="4.62">because the Bible is clear that it is</text>
  <text start="66.9" dur="4.92">appointed and once Adam and to die and</text>
  <text start="69.33" dur="4.17">then the judgment suicide prevents any</text>
  <text start="71.82" dur="4.86">chance for that person to later find</text>
  <text start="73.5" dur="4.86">repentance and salvation in fact the</text>
  <text start="76.68" dur="3.93">person who chooses suicide is choosing</text>
  <text start="78.36" dur="4.619">eternal death don&amp;#39;t blame the writer for</text>
  <text start="80.61" dur="4.41">this view I&amp;#39;m merely restating exactly</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="4.411">what the biblical text states about the</text>
  <text start="85.02" dur="3.9">subject yet what have we heard</text>
  <text start="87.39" dur="3.9">incessantly from the media and the</text>
  <text start="88.92" dur="4.409">culture how wonderful a man Robin</text>
  <text start="91.29" dur="4.41">Williams was how he lived a life of</text>
  <text start="93.329" dur="4.561">giving to so many people how his suicide</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="4.169">while tragic was merely the effect of a</text>
  <text start="97.89" dur="3.74">disease called depression which Robin</text>
  <text start="99.869" dur="4.471">Williams simply could not defeat in</text>
  <text start="101.63" dur="4.57">effect the media and culture have</text>
  <text start="104.34" dur="4.59">conspired to show Robin Williams as an</text>
  <text start="106.2" dur="6.27">innocent victim and yet just the</text>
  <text start="108.93" dur="6.18">opposite is true depression is not a</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="4.28">disease depression is the result of not</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="4.98">giving one&amp;#39;s heart to the king of kings</text>
  <text start="116.75" dur="5.32">Joshua of Nazareth suicide is not an</text>
  <text start="120.09" dur="3.989">accident it is the selfish choice of an</text>
  <text start="122.07" dur="4.13">individual to hurt those who love him</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="4.981">most by running away from his problems</text>
  <text start="126.2" dur="5.11">Robin Williams is not a victim he is a</text>
  <text start="129.06" dur="4.29">murderer and forever will be known as a</text>
  <text start="131.31" dur="4.08">murderer in the halls of eternal</text>
  <text start="133.35" dur="5.07">justice despite what the majority of</text>
  <text start="135.39" dur="5.31">Americans may now feel and what have we</text>
  <text start="138.42" dur="4.53">seen over the past several days Shepard</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="4.53">Smith of Fox News was initially brave</text>
  <text start="142.95" dur="4.86">enough to call Robin Williams suicide an</text>
  <text start="145.23" dur="4.92">act of cowardice but came under such an</text>
  <text start="147.81" dur="4.65">onslaught of vitriol he backpedaled and</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="4.77">apologized that&amp;#39;s where we are as a</text>
  <text start="152.46" dur="4.65">nation news anchors have to apologize</text>
  <text start="154.92" dur="5.16">for truth because it offends so many</text>
  <text start="157.11" dur="4.77">people Rush Limbaugh rightly noted on</text>
  <text start="160.08" dur="3.9">his radio program that just a generation</text>
  <text start="161.88" dur="3.96">ago before the vast d loog of a</text>
  <text start="163.98" dur="4.2">political correctness had drowned this</text>
  <text start="165.84" dur="4.08">nation it was commonly accepted by most</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="3.93">Americans that when someone committed</text>
  <text start="169.92" dur="4.68">suicide it was an act of cowardice and</text>
  <text start="172.11" dur="4.41">unmitigated selfishness it was frowned</text>
  <text start="174.6" dur="4.25">upon and most were disgusted by those</text>
  <text start="176.52" dur="5.07">who did such a horrid thing but not now</text>
  <text start="178.85" dur="4.78">now as the psychobabble of the pseudo</text>
  <text start="181.59" dur="4.2">science of psychology has taken control</text>
  <text start="183.63" dur="5.13">of this culture we don&amp;#39;t even recognize</text>
  <text start="185.79" dur="5.04">truth anymore and let me be clear most</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="3.84">forms of psychology are merely man&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.83" dur="3.72">ways of trying to explain the human</text>
  <text start="192.6" dur="4.77">experience without wanting to consent to</text>
  <text start="194.55" dur="3.99">the Bible or its author instead we</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="3.6">comfort ourselves with meaningless</text>
  <text start="198.54" dur="4.95">platitudes desperately trying to justify</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="4.2">an act of self murder and removing all</text>
  <text start="203.49" dur="3.72">responsibilities for such an act by</text>
  <text start="205.17" dur="4.56">claiming a made-up disease causes such</text>
  <text start="207.21" dur="4.35">suffering I realize some if not most</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="3.66">reading or hearing this article on</text>
  <text start="211.56" dur="4.29">YouTube may dismiss me as some</text>
  <text start="213.39" dur="3.69">cold-hearted idiotic bible thumper who</text>
  <text start="215.85" dur="3.48">simply does not understand the</text>
  <text start="217.08" dur="3.51">complexities of modern life but if</text>
  <text start="219.33" dur="4.35">anyone should know what depression is</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="5.31">like it would be me my wife of nearly a</text>
  <text start="223.68" dur="3.96">decade turned away from God became an</text>
  <text start="225.9" dur="3.69">atheist and after divorcing me</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="3.99">manipulated the courts and to cutting me</text>
  <text start="229.59" dur="3.84">off from my six children whom I&amp;#39;ve not</text>
  <text start="231.63" dur="4.53">been able to so much as write a letter</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="5.37">to for nearly four years talk about</text>
  <text start="236.16" dur="4.95">depressing but why did this disease not</text>
  <text start="238.8" dur="3.69">claim me indeed I&amp;#39;ve heard of many</text>
  <text start="241.11" dur="3.78">stories of men who have gone through</text>
  <text start="242.49" dur="4.5">similar ordeals as me losing their</text>
  <text start="244.89" dur="4.08">families and I&amp;#39;ve chosen what Robin</text>
  <text start="246.99" dur="4.08">Williams chose allowing their depression</text>
  <text start="248.97" dur="5.43">to drive them into that unthinkable act</text>
  <text start="251.07" dur="5.52">and what made me different let me give</text>
  <text start="254.4" dur="4.83">you a clue it had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="256.59" dur="4.019">some chemical imbalance of the brain it</text>
  <text start="259.23" dur="3.689">had everything to do with the fact that</text>
  <text start="260.609" dur="4.711">unlike Robin Williams and the others i</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="2.881">mentioned i have chosen to fully submit</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="2.7">my heart</text>
  <text start="265.8" dur="5.82">and will to Yahshua the Messiah of</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="5.7">Israel he and he alone has brought me</text>
  <text start="271.62" dur="3.93">through the darkest of times giving me</text>
  <text start="273.72" dur="4.199">purpose and joy even through the most</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="4.23">painful of where deals I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="277.919" dur="3.99">suggesting my personal life is an exact</text>
  <text start="279.78" dur="3.96">replica of Robin Williams I would never</text>
  <text start="281.909" dur="4.201">suggest such a thing I don&amp;#39;t know them</text>
  <text start="283.74" dur="3.899">in but what I am saying is that just</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="3.42">like him I&amp;#39;ve had to wrestle with</text>
  <text start="287.639" dur="4.141">depression as have millions upon</text>
  <text start="289.53" dur="4.41">millions of people since the time Adam</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="3.389">and Eve were driven from the garden but</text>
  <text start="293.94" dur="3.75">what keeps someone from allowing</text>
  <text start="295.169" dur="4.021">depression to drive one to suicide has</text>
  <text start="297.69" dur="3.99">nothing to do with going to the right</text>
  <text start="299.19" dur="5.189">rehab hospital or taking the right drug</text>
  <text start="301.68" dur="5.549">but has everything to do with complete</text>
