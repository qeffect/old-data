  <text start="4.35" dur="8.19">dedication happy festival of lights it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="9.3" dur="5.58">known by many many many names and this</text>
  <text start="12.54" dur="4.95">is daniel john lee with poor restoration</text>
  <text start="14.88" dur="4.2">ministries wishing you a Happy Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="17.49" dur="3.84">I wanted to do a short podcast on</text>
  <text start="19.08" dur="5.91">Hanukkah and as you can see here I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="21.33" dur="6.869">kind of departed a bit from Jewish</text>
  <text start="24.99" dur="4.83">tradition because first of all I was not</text>
  <text start="28.199" dur="3.121">able to get a menorah I used to have a</text>
  <text start="29.82" dur="4.079">menorah and I don&amp;#39;t have one I need to</text>
  <text start="31.32" dur="4.47">order one but I went to the Jewish store</text>
  <text start="33.899" dur="4.021">here in Portland Oregon and all they had</text>
  <text start="35.79" dur="4.17">were the Hana Kia&amp;#39;s which are the nine</text>
  <text start="37.92" dur="5.459">branched menorahs and of course those</text>
  <text start="39.96" dur="5.64">are not biblical or scriptural so i went</text>
  <text start="43.379" dur="4.171">ahead and i got seven candles to</text>
  <text start="45.6" dur="6.36">represent a seven branch menorah which</text>
  <text start="47.55" dur="6.21">is scriptural those seven branch</text>
  <text start="51.96" dur="3.989">menorahs are the ones that were in the</text>
  <text start="53.76" dur="4.41">temple and the one that is represented</text>
  <text start="55.949" dur="7.68">all through revelation so I&amp;#39;ve lit my</text>
  <text start="58.17" dur="8.16">seven candles here 77 branch menorah</text>
  <text start="63.629" dur="4.861">here if you will for Hanukkah because</text>
  <text start="66.33" dur="7.289">this is the festival festival of lights</text>
  <text start="68.49" dur="6.989">and I just want to go briefly over</text>
  <text start="73.619" dur="4.531">Hanukkah and its significance and why we</text>
  <text start="75.479" dur="4.621">as servants of Yahshua celebrated first</text>
  <text start="78.15" dur="4.649">of all there&amp;#39;s a myth out there that</text>
  <text start="80.1" dur="6.99">says well because Hanukkah is not listed</text>
  <text start="82.799" dur="7.051">in Leviticus 23 it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a piece that</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="5.01">we don&amp;#39;t need to celebrate and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="4.949">really that&amp;#39;s really wrong because first</text>
  <text start="92.1" dur="4.229">of all it&amp;#39;s an incredible celebration it</text>
  <text start="94.799" dur="4.71">celebrates a very wonderful thing which</text>
  <text start="96.329" dur="5.311">we&amp;#39;ll get into but you know as followers</text>
  <text start="99.509" dur="5.731">of Messiah Yahshua were to emulate our</text>
  <text start="101.64" dur="6.63">behavior and model it after Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="105.24" dur="4.76">he kept the feast of dedication if you</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="4.169">read in John jochen on Chapter seven</text>
  <text start="110" dur="6.67">you&amp;#39;ll clearly see that he was at the</text>
  <text start="112.439" dur="6.75">temple he was participating and teaching</text>
  <text start="116.67" dur="4.26">at the Temple in Jerusalem during the</text>
  <text start="119.189" dur="4.29">feast the winter feast the feast of</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="4.079">dedication or Hanukkah certainly if</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="3.721">Yahshua did not want us to participate</text>
  <text start="125.009" dur="3.78">in Hanukkah he would not have been</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="2.46">anywhere near the vicinity to the temple</text>
  <text start="128.789" dur="2.851">because that would have been the</text>
  <text start="129.66" dur="3.35">epicenter of the festivities for</text>
  <text start="131.64" dur="3.019">Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="133.01" dur="3.99">he was there he was teaching he was</text>
  <text start="134.659" dur="4.47">participating he even talked about he</text>
  <text start="137" dur="4.799">how he was the light of the world during</text>
  <text start="139.129" dur="4.801">that time which as you can see you know</text>
  <text start="141.799" dur="4.14">one of the names of Hanukkah is festival</text>
  <text start="143.93" dur="4.52">of lights so he was pointing to himself</text>
  <text start="145.939" dur="4.321">that he is the fulfillment of Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="148.45" dur="3.7">also hanukkah has some prophetic</text>
  <text start="150.26" dur="4.8">implications which we&amp;#39;ll get into toward</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="5.729">the end of the podcast as you may or may</text>
  <text start="155.06" dur="5.7">not know Hanukkah is historical it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="157.879" dur="4.56">basically an Israeli version of the</text>
  <text start="160.76" dur="4.229">fourth of July it&amp;#39;s an Independence Day</text>
  <text start="162.439" dur="4.86">so what happened was is a couple hundred</text>
  <text start="164.989" dur="7.521">years a little less than that before the</text>
  <text start="167.299" dur="7.891">Messiah we have the Greeks who</text>
  <text start="172.51" dur="5.379">desecrated Jerusalem they conquered</text>
  <text start="175.19" dur="5.01">Israel they profaned the temple they</text>
  <text start="177.889" dur="5.85">forbid and Jews from keeping the Torah</text>
  <text start="180.2" dur="5.73">and it was a it was a very very terrible</text>
  <text start="183.739" dur="4.771">and tragic time but a small group of</text>
  <text start="185.93" dur="5.97">rebels known as The Maccabees led by</text>
  <text start="188.51" dur="6.119">Judas Maccabee and his sons they led a</text>
  <text start="191.9" dur="6.119">revolt and what happened was as they</text>
  <text start="194.629" dur="5.911">wound up going up into the hills of</text>
  <text start="198.019" dur="4.56">Judea and they waged a guerrilla warfare</text>
  <text start="200.54" dur="5.129">against the massive Greek army and they</text>
  <text start="202.579" dur="5.731">were severely outnumbered they they had</text>
  <text start="205.669" dur="5.701">primitive weaponry they were no match</text>
  <text start="208.31" dur="4.95">for the Greek forces the Greek Empire at</text>
  <text start="211.37" dur="4.44">that time was the Empire was the</text>
  <text start="213.26" dur="5.64">equivalent to the United States today</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="7.85">and so they were greatly outnumbered in</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="7.89">every way and yet they were dedicated to</text>
  <text start="223.66" dur="5.35">removing the Greeks from Jerusalem and</text>
  <text start="226.79" dur="4.68">from Israel and they were dedicated to</text>
  <text start="229.01" dur="4.05">restoring the purity of Torah to their</text>
  <text start="231.47" dur="4.169">people and that&amp;#39;s exactly what they did</text>
  <text start="233.06" dur="4.859">through the help of yah and through a</text>
  <text start="235.639" dur="4.171">series of battles over a span of a few</text>
  <text start="237.919" dur="4.53">years they were able to completely and</text>
  <text start="239.81" dur="4.889">totally drive out the Greeks they were</text>
  <text start="242.449" dur="4.231">able to liberate Israel and Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="244.699" dur="3.72">and they were able to cleanse the temple</text>
  <text start="246.68" dur="2.97">and during the time when they cleanse</text>
  <text start="248.419" dur="4.621">the temple because it had been so</text>
  <text start="249.65" dur="6.049">profaned by the Greeks it took eight</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="4.71">days to completely cleanse the temple</text>
  <text start="255.699" dur="3.76">that&amp;#39;s the typical amount of time it</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="3.269">takes to cleanse the temple and so</text>
  <text start="259.459" dur="3.871">that&amp;#39;s where we get the eight days of</text>
  <text start="261.019" dur="5.801">Hanukkah and why we celebrate it for</text>
  <text start="263.33" dur="6.22">eight days so this is a very inspiring</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="4.89">story it&amp;#39;s a time where a small group of</text>
  <text start="269.55" dur="4.47">outnumbered people dedicated to Yahweh</text>
  <text start="271.71" dur="4.92">in his Torah overcame insurmountable</text>
  <text start="274.02" dur="4.71">odds they drove back the enemy and they</text>
  <text start="276.63" dur="4.86">were victorious and restoring the purity</text>
  <text start="278.73" dur="4.2">of Torah to their nation so really why</text>
  <text start="281.49" dur="4.17">would we not want to celebrate such a</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="4.89">wonderful wonderful festival because it</text>
  <text start="285.66" dur="4.56">celebrates everything that we should</text>
  <text start="287.82" dur="5.88">strive for it celebrates cleaving the</text>
  <text start="290.22" dur="5.1">yah it celebrates upholding his Torah no</text>
  <text start="293.7" dur="3.78">matter what even when it&amp;#39;s unpopular and</text>
  <text start="295.32" dur="3.66">it celebrates being able to overcome the</text>
  <text start="297.48" dur="3.33">enemy even when we&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="298.98" dur="7.59">outnumbered because with yah we can do</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="7.26">anything now if you go to my website WWE</text>
  <text start="306.57" dur="3.24">spirit and tour com you will see a</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="5.16">series of trilogies if you go to the</text>
  <text start="309.81" dur="5.4">second trilogy you&amp;#39;ll discover in that</text>
  <text start="313.23" dur="4.14">trilogy and those articles that I</text>
  <text start="315.21" dur="4.41">discuss the prophetic implications of</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="6.2">Hanukkah and I believe that Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="6.96">marks the end of the 1,335 days</text>
  <text start="323.57" dur="5.62">mentioned in Daniel in the Book of</text>
  <text start="326.58" dur="5.04">Daniel which starts approximately the</text>
  <text start="329.19" dur="4.68">midway through the tribulation and ends</text>
  <text start="331.62" dur="4.5">after yahshua&amp;#39;s returned on yom teruah a</text>
  <text start="333.87" dur="4.71">couple months later is hanukkah and that</text>
  <text start="336.12" dur="5.82">is when Yahshua rededicate sand and</text>
  <text start="338.58" dur="6.24">cleanses and rebuilds or finishes</text>
  <text start="341.94" dur="6.24">rebuilding the temple for his millennial</text>
  <text start="344.82" dur="4.68">reign so Hanukkah I think fits in to the</text>
  <text start="348.18" dur="5.13">timepieces there and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.5" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s possible to understand the Book of</text>
  <text start="353.31" dur="5.1">Daniel fully and to make all the time</text>
  <text start="355.11" dur="6.02">frames work unless Hanukkah and for that</text>
  <text start="358.41" dur="6.21">matter Purim are both understood and</text>
  <text start="361.13" dur="5.59">read and celebrated so I think Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="364.62" dur="3.96">is a feast that that we should keep I</text>
  <text start="366.72" dur="4.64">think it&amp;#39;s AI think it&amp;#39;s more than a</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="6.36">tradition i think it&amp;#39;s a biblical feast</text>
  <text start="371.36" dur="5.17">that we should do because Yahshua kept</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="3.45">it in john chapter 7 the reason i say</text>
  <text start="376.53" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s biblical is even though it came</text>
  <text start="378.39" dur="4.71">about after the Torah and the Tanakh</text>
  <text start="380.34" dur="4.71">were written it was celebrated it was</text>
  <text start="383.1" dur="4.02">referred to in celebrated by Yahshua in</text>
  <text start="385.05" dur="3.96">John chapter 7 part of the Gospels so</text>
  <text start="387.12" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s why I say it is a biblical feast</text>
  <text start="389.01" dur="5.94">as much as Purim which was started in</text>
  <text start="392.19" dur="4.79">Esther so it has a prophetic</text>
  <text start="394.95" dur="4.77">significance it&amp;#39;s a wonderful feast</text>
  <text start="396.98" dur="4.01">granted there is a lot of paganism that</text>
  <text start="399.72" dur="4.36">has seeped into</text>
  <text start="400.99" dur="7.92">turned a Hanukkah mainly because a lot</text>
  <text start="404.08" dur="6.3">of the Jews have wanted to sort of have</text>
  <text start="408.91" dur="2.55">a Christmas that they&amp;#39;re never able to</text>
  <text start="410.38" dur="3.09">have so that&amp;#39;s where you get the</text>
  <text start="411.46" dur="4.14">Hanukkah bush which tries to imitate the</text>
  <text start="413.47" dur="5.67">Christmas tree you got the spinning of</text>
  <text start="415.6" dur="7.29">the dreidel you have the the myth of the</text>
  <text start="419.14" dur="5.73">of the oil which mmm I think it&amp;#39;s a myth</text>
  <text start="422.89" dur="4.26">although recently I&amp;#39;ve had a friend who</text>
  <text start="424.87" dur="4.23">suggested that it might might not be a</text>
  <text start="427.15" dur="4.71">myth so I&amp;#39;m sort of undecided on that</text>
  <text start="429.1" dur="4.29">right now but there&amp;#39;s a lot of paganism</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="3.75">that have seeped into Hanukkah but the</text>
  <text start="433.39" dur="5.28">purity of Hanukkah which is the story of</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="6.12">a rededication the story of overcoming</text>
  <text start="438.67" dur="4.41">insurmountable odds and upholding the</text>
  <text start="441.73" dur="3.99">tour and cleaving the yacht and</text>
  <text start="443.08" dur="4.2">defeating the enemy that is a beautiful</text>
  <text start="445.72" dur="4.23">story and that is worthy to be</text>
  <text start="447.28" dur="7.74">celebrated for eight days it&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="449.95" dur="6.9">way to to stand out and sort of be set</text>
  <text start="455.02" dur="5.28">apart from the revelry and the paganism</text>
  <text start="456.85" dur="5.34">of xmas at this time of year and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="460.3" dur="5.25">great way to talk about with your</text>
  <text start="462.19" dur="5.1">friends and family what happens when</text>
  <text start="465.55" dur="4.89">even a small group of dedicated people</text>
  <text start="467.29" dur="4.95">choose to obey the Torah and to love yah</text>
  <text start="470.44" dur="4.11">with everything in them that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="472.24" dur="5.67">able to overcome insurmountable odds so</text>
  <text start="474.55" dur="5.79">I am we&amp;#39;re basically at the end of the</text>
  <text start="477.91" dur="4.23">feast of Hanukkah here it started on on</text>
  <text start="480.34" dur="6">December twentieth and it actually ends</text>
  <text start="482.14" dur="6.21">tomorrow December the 27th but you know</text>
  <text start="486.34" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s great to like these candles it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="488.35" dur="3.75">great to read about the Maccabees and</text>
  <text start="489.88" dur="5.25">what they did it&amp;#39;s great to meditate on</text>
  <text start="492.1" dur="6.48">what it means to be Victoria in Yahshua</text>
  <text start="495.13" dur="6.39">and to overcome and to cleave to him and</text>
  <text start="498.58" dur="4.68">to his Torah of course it&amp;#39;s a great time</text>
  <text start="501.52" dur="4.59">to give gifts it&amp;#39;s a great time to</text>
  <text start="503.26" dur="6.27">celebrate and everything and have great</text>
  <text start="506.11" dur="4.74">meals and things like that but I think</text>
