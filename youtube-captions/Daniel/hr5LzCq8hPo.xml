  <text start="2.85" dur="5.009">with Torah restoration ministries it is</text>
  <text start="4.95" dur="7.769">the Sabbath day Shabbat morning Saturday</text>
  <text start="7.859" dur="8.67">September the ninth 2017 this is part 17</text>
  <text start="12.719" dur="5.911">of my 17 part series of reconciling the</text>
  <text start="16.529" dur="3.75">teachings of Messiah Yahshua and Apostle</text>
  <text start="18.63" dur="3.78">Paul and more importantly really</text>
  <text start="20.279" dur="4.231">reconciling the entire Bible because we</text>
  <text start="22.41" dur="5.55">know the Bible will never contradict</text>
  <text start="24.51" dur="5.58">itself and and yet unfortunately modern</text>
  <text start="27.96" dur="3.84">day Christianity and even a lot of those</text>
  <text start="30.09" dur="4.26">in the Messianic movement caused the</text>
  <text start="31.8" dur="4.29">Bible to contradict itself by by saying</text>
  <text start="34.35" dur="3.81">that Apostle Paul or that the New</text>
  <text start="36.09" dur="4.23">Testament somehow teaches against</text>
  <text start="38.16" dur="4.59">obeying what the Torah has been laid out</text>
  <text start="40.32" dur="4.11">in the Tanakh and what is referred to as</text>
  <text start="42.75" dur="3.239">the Old Testament and that&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="44.43" dur="2.73">the case the Bible doesn&amp;#39;t contradict</text>
  <text start="45.989" dur="3.511">itself and that&amp;#39;s the whole point of</text>
  <text start="47.16" dur="5.039">this series is to show that and to show</text>
  <text start="49.5" dur="5.85">that Paul and the New Testament always</text>
  <text start="52.199" dur="7.741">up holds the Torah so this is part 17 my</text>
  <text start="55.35" dur="7.68">final part and this is in Hebrews 10 law</text>
  <text start="59.94" dur="5.429">a shadow can&amp;#39;t make you perfect so we</text>
  <text start="63.03" dur="3.659">have an interesting conundrum here that</text>
  <text start="65.369" dur="3.301">I&amp;#39;m going to pose to you and that is</text>
  <text start="66.689" dur="4.771">when you first start in Hebrews 10 it</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="4.47">says for the law the Torah having a</text>
  <text start="71.46" dur="4.019">shadow of good things to come and not</text>
  <text start="73.14" dur="4.229">the very image of the things can never</text>
  <text start="75.479" dur="4.171">with those sacrifices which they offered</text>
  <text start="77.369" dur="4.68">year by year continually make the comers</text>
  <text start="79.65" dur="4.59">thereunto perfect seems like a pretty</text>
  <text start="82.049" dur="7.86">straightforward statement right but then</text>
  <text start="84.24" dur="7.53">you have in Psalm 19 verse 7 says the</text>
  <text start="89.909" dur="4.53">law of Yahweh the tour of Yahweh is</text>
  <text start="91.77" dur="4.349">perfect converting the soul or another</text>
  <text start="94.439" dur="4.89">translation says refreshing the soul I</text>
  <text start="96.119" dur="5.911">like that the testimony of Yahweh sure</text>
  <text start="99.329" dur="5.551">making wise is simple uh-oh does the</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="4.74">Bible contradict itself does this David</text>
  <text start="104.88" dur="4.349">under the unction of the Holy Spirit the</text>
  <text start="106.77" dur="4.44">Ruach writing Psalm 19 is he saying ah</text>
  <text start="109.229" dur="4.71">look the law is perfect in converting</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="4.5">the soul and then the writer of Hebrews</text>
  <text start="113.939" dur="3.96">says the law can&amp;#39;t make you perfect what</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="5.13">what&amp;#39;s going on here well there is no</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="6.9">contradiction so as we discussed in the</text>
  <text start="120.84" dur="5.76">last part in part 16 we see that this</text>
  <text start="124.799" dur="3.231">part 10 is kind of continuing the</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="2.99">thought from</text>
  <text start="128.03" dur="2.82">the traffic has continued to thought</text>
  <text start="129.59" dur="3.63">from from chapter 9 where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="130.85" dur="4.23">dealing with a specific portion tour</text>
  <text start="133.22" dur="3.69">which are the Levitical sacrifices and</text>
  <text start="135.08" dur="4.5">those things cannot make you perfect</text>
  <text start="136.91" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s why it says that if it was</text>
  <text start="139.58" dur="3.48">possible this goes on in verse 4 if it</text>
  <text start="141.5" dur="3.66">was possible for the blood of bulls and</text>
  <text start="143.06" dur="3.87">goats should take away your sins then</text>
  <text start="145.16" dur="5.64">there would be no need for the Messiah</text>
  <text start="146.93" dur="5.4">sacrifice but those burnt offerings</text>
  <text start="150.8" dur="3.6">those sacrifices those things were never</text>
  <text start="152.33" dur="4.68">even in the Tanakh they were never</text>
  <text start="154.4" dur="4.38">designed to purge the the conscience</text>
  <text start="157.01" dur="3.66">they were a a covering they were a</text>
  <text start="158.78" dur="4.26">temporary thing pointing forward to the</text>
  <text start="160.67" dur="4.32">Messiah just like mind you in the</text>
  <text start="163.04" dur="3.84">Millennial Kingdom when Messiah rules</text>
  <text start="164.99" dur="3.69">and reigns for a thousand years the</text>
  <text start="166.88" dur="3.33">Levitical sacrifices will be</text>
  <text start="168.68" dur="3.66">re-established because remember not one</text>
  <text start="170.21" dur="3.3">jot or tittle passes away until the</text>
  <text start="172.34" dur="2.81">heavens and earth pass away which won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="173.51" dur="4.05">be until after the Millennial Kingdom</text>
  <text start="175.15" dur="4.87">those sacrifices will then point back</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="4.26">toward what Messiah did so in that in</text>
  <text start="180.02" dur="4.32">the ancient Israel times they pointed</text>
  <text start="181.82" dur="4.38">forward to what Messiah did and in the</text>
  <text start="184.34" dur="3.69">future Millennial Kingdom when he rules</text>
  <text start="186.2" dur="4.41">from Jerusalem they&amp;#39;ll point back to</text>
  <text start="188.03" dur="5.97">rated but they were never ever designed</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="6.51">to to purge the conscious that it was</text>
  <text start="194" dur="6.18">never part of it however if you continue</text>
  <text start="197.12" dur="5.13">reading it talks about how because now</text>
  <text start="200.18" dur="4.35">we have Messiah sacrifice which is what</text>
  <text start="202.25" dur="5.52">those Levitical sacrifices have always</text>
  <text start="204.53" dur="7.01">pointed toward because we have that then</text>
  <text start="207.77" dur="6.39">it repeats what we see in in Hebrews 8</text>
  <text start="211.54" dur="3.73">where it says in verse 16 this is the</text>
  <text start="214.16" dur="3.06">Covenant that I will make with them</text>
  <text start="215.27" dur="3.78">after these days saith Yahweh I will put</text>
  <text start="217.22" dur="4.59">my laws into their hearts and in their</text>
  <text start="219.05" dur="4.14">minds will I write them so we see now</text>
  <text start="221.81" dur="4.08">that this fulfillment of what the</text>
  <text start="223.19" dur="5.46">Levitical laws were pointing toward now</text>
  <text start="225.89" dur="4.379">enables those laws those Commandments</text>
  <text start="228.65" dur="4.619">that taurah to be put in a heart in mind</text>
  <text start="230.269" dur="5.161">making us perfect so david didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="233.269" dur="5.041">contradict what hebrews says David is</text>
  <text start="235.43" dur="4.95">right the Torah is perfect to converting</text>
  <text start="238.31" dur="4.44">the soul because the whole Torah points</text>
  <text start="240.38" dur="4.74">toward Yahshua Yahshua is the very Torah</text>
  <text start="242.75" dur="4.29">clothed in the flesh and he converts our</text>
  <text start="245.12" dur="4.41">soul and helps us walk in the light as</text>
  <text start="247.04" dur="4.949">he walked in the light that&amp;#39;s why David</text>
  <text start="249.53" dur="4.47">said in another Psalm your Torah is a</text>
  <text start="251.989" dur="4.471">lamp unto my feet and a light unto my</text>
  <text start="254" dur="4.12">path and why Yahshua said he is the</text>
  <text start="256.46" dur="4.839">light of the world</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="5.519">it&amp;#39;s all one in the same and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="261.299" dur="4.891">Hebrews 10 is all about that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="263.639" dur="4.891">Hebrews 10 is all about so he now is our</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="4.35">high priest he now sprinkles our</text>
  <text start="268.53" dur="4.139">conscious with his blood purging us from</text>
  <text start="270.54" dur="4.14">our dead works and our evil conscience</text>
  <text start="272.669" dur="4.281">so that we can live a new and clean life</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="6.15">and we can now have this inward desire</text>
  <text start="276.95" dur="7.48">to obey Him and to love him so the Bible</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="5.28">does not contradict itself and the Torah</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="5.27">is perfect in converting the soul and</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="7.14">Messiah is the Torah clothes and flesh</text>
  <text start="289.7" dur="6.7">so this is a very very beautiful passage</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="4.59">in Hebrews 10 in fact it has it has one</text>
  <text start="296.4" dur="3.39">of my favorite verses in there where it</text>
  <text start="297.84" dur="4.44">says for yet a little while this is in</text>
  <text start="299.79" dur="5.04">verse 37 for yet a little while and he</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="4.98">that shall come will come and will not</text>
  <text start="304.83" dur="4.53">tarry it so reminds me of the last verse</text>
  <text start="307.26" dur="6.08">in Revelation where it says even so come</text>
  <text start="309.36" dur="7.23">quickly Yahshua come quickly</text>
  <text start="313.34" dur="5.5">hallelujah well I it is my sincere</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="4.47">prayer that this 17 part series has been</text>
  <text start="318.84" dur="4.86">a ministry to the body of Messiah that</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="4.169">it&amp;#39;s hopefully either strengthened your</text>
  <text start="323.7" dur="3.54">convictions and and edified and</text>
  <text start="325.229" dur="4.051">strengthened you so that you have a way</text>
  <text start="327.24" dur="3.9">to reach out to those who maybe are in</text>
  <text start="329.28" dur="3.24">your sphere of influence that try to</text>
  <text start="331.14" dur="2.73">tell you oh yeah I know the New</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="3.12">Testament says we don&amp;#39;t have to keep all</text>
  <text start="333.87" dur="3.18">that Old Testament Torah stuff all right</text>
  <text start="335.64" dur="3.24">you know Paul Paul said you know we</text>
  <text start="337.05" dur="3.27">don&amp;#39;t know hopefully this will help you</text>
  <text start="338.88" dur="3.12">and if and if maybe you&amp;#39;re one of those</text>
  <text start="340.32" dur="3.21">who have been in the Christian movement</text>
  <text start="342" dur="2.94">the Messianic movement and you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="343.53" dur="2.85">saying oh yeah I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="344.94" dur="2.31">bother with that Torah stop Paul Paul</text>
  <text start="346.38" dur="2.28">said we don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="4.13">hopefully this corrects that in your</text>
  <text start="348.66" dur="5.43">heart and you&amp;#39;re convicted now to really</text>
  <text start="351.38" dur="4.84">not twist Paul&amp;#39;s words but to really see</text>
  <text start="354.09" dur="3.329">how when you study deeply and you</text>
  <text start="356.22" dur="3.78">understand what Paul&amp;#39;s saying in the</text>
  <text start="357.419" dur="5.611">context of what he&amp;#39;s saying it all it</text>
  <text start="360" dur="4.71">all harmonizes with the Tanakh with the</text>
  <text start="363.03" dur="3.69">massage teaching in the Gospels with</text>
  <text start="364.71" dur="4.26">throughout all would be in Revelation</text>
  <text start="366.72" dur="4.949">this Bible never contradicts itself not</text>
  <text start="368.97" dur="5.73">even once it&amp;#39;s a beautiful word his word</text>
  <text start="371.669" dur="4.201">which in Psalms it says he puts his word</text>

  <text start="378.06" dur="5.19">preserves from generation to generation</text>
  <text start="380.49" dur="4.89">and he inspired men of old to write</text>
