  <text start="216.79" dur="5.759">Hannah and I came here this year and</text>

  <text start="234.12" dur="5.28">weapon so during this piece of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="236.19" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s important that we remember that you</text>
  <text start="239.4" dur="3.21">know when we find ourselves in tough</text>
  <text start="240.84" dur="3.18">situations like John did like John and</text>

  <text start="261.45" dur="5.1">during Sukkot is how important prayer is</text>
  <text start="264.6" dur="3.63">well remember what Yahshua says I said</text>
  <text start="266.55" dur="3.27">when you pray go into your little suka</text>
  <text start="268.23" dur="4.38">go into your little closet and pray and</text>
  <text start="269.82" dur="4.83">what you pray in secret the father will</text>
  <text start="272.61" dur="3.48">reward you openly so get into your</text>

  <text start="279.15" dur="4.8">and make sure that you use that most</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="4.98">important weapon which is a blood bot</text>
