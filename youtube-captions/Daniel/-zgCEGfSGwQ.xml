  <text start="15.33" dur="5.869">in the living room of houses we were</text>
  <text start="17.1" dur="6.24">cleaning life was good and comfortable</text>
  <text start="21.199" dur="3.58">for the first time in our lives we were</text>
  <text start="23.34" dur="3.75">actually able to put away some money</text>
  <text start="24.779" dur="5.01">each month and little shoebox tucked</text>
  <text start="27.09" dur="4.89">toward the back of her closet it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="29.789" dur="4.171">much but it felt so good not to have any</text>
  <text start="31.98" dur="4.05">debt and to actually be able to start</text>
  <text start="33.96" dur="4.5">saving rather than financially drownded</text>
  <text start="36.03" dur="4.439">as fall transitioned into our second</text>
  <text start="38.46" dur="3.599">winter Mariposa kept on cleaning houses</text>
  <text start="40.469" dur="3.601">and I started throwing myself into</text>
  <text start="42.059" dur="4.621">creative writing something I had not</text>
  <text start="44.07" dur="4.98">actively fostered for several years we</text>
  <text start="46.68" dur="3.87">also tried new various modifications to</text>
  <text start="49.05" dur="3.57">our schedule just to see how things have</text>
  <text start="50.55" dur="3.93">worked for several months Annika would</text>
  <text start="52.62" dur="3.18">go clean houses of baby Miriam while I</text>
  <text start="54.48" dur="4.169">stayed home and home schooled the two</text>
  <text start="55.8" dur="5.279">boys day after day seated in my computer</text>
  <text start="58.649" dur="4.861">chair I would face Isaiah and Elijah who</text>
  <text start="61.079" dur="4.44">set him our large couch for a few hours</text>
  <text start="63.51" dur="3.69">ago would take out a huge colorful map</text>
  <text start="65.519" dur="3.841">of the United States with them on the</text>
  <text start="67.2" dur="4.38">various states eventually they even</text>
  <text start="69.36" dur="4.02">memorized the Capitals food review</text>
  <text start="71.58" dur="4.05">scripture do some math and study history</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="3.989">there was a wonderfully delightful time</text>
  <text start="75.63" dur="4.559">and Annika enjoyed the peaceful solitude</text>
  <text start="77.369" dur="4.831">of housecleaning with baby Mary my life</text>
  <text start="80.189" dur="4.561">was smoothly contempt and to this day I</text>
  <text start="82.2" dur="3.54">often refer to it as the golden years of</text>
  <text start="84.75" dur="4.38">Mariposa</text>
  <text start="85.74" dur="5.25">still I knew lurking deep beneath our</text>
  <text start="89.13" dur="4.919">contentment the spirit of yah was</text>
  <text start="90.99" dur="4.5">nudging a gentle loving nudge reminding</text>
  <text start="94.049" dur="3.96">me that I could not hide out in the</text>
  <text start="95.49" dur="4.32">mountains forever as much as y&amp;#39;all had</text>
  <text start="98.009" dur="4.11">blessed us in the nearly two years we</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="4.32">had spent in Mariposa I could not escape</text>
  <text start="102.119" dur="3.56">the fact that what had led us here was</text>
  <text start="104.13" dur="4.32">my running away from the ministry in</text>
  <text start="105.679" dur="4.421">Portland I had pulled a Jonah and though</text>
  <text start="108.45" dur="3.63">yahshua was merciful and allowing me</text>
  <text start="110.1" dur="3.6">time to recover eventually under the</text>
  <text start="112.08" dur="3.719">pressure of that ever-present tug I</text>
  <text start="113.7" dur="5.61">would have to heed the call to get back</text>
  <text start="115.799" dur="6">into the fray still my contentment of</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="4.77">mariposa was so deep and so refreshing</text>
  <text start="121.799" dur="4.041">that I often look out the windows as</text>
  <text start="124.08" dur="3.87">dozens of deer would come up to our door</text>
  <text start="125.84" dur="3.699">dreaming about the perfect Norman</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="4.259">Rockwell&amp;#39;s life that could continue</text>
  <text start="129.539" dur="4.321">forever in his idyllic mountains here</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="4.201">there was no pressures of the ministry</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="4.5">here I just had my family the rugged</text>
  <text start="136.41" dur="3.42">outdoors and a beginning to thrive</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="4.14">business that didn&amp;#39;t require a lot of</text>
  <text start="139.83" dur="4.469">overhead by the time the lazy warm</text>
  <text start="142.5" dur="3.63">months of summer arrived I had utterly</text>
  <text start="144.299" dur="3.991">convinced myself that our new beginning</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="4.53">in this butterfly mountain town would</text>
  <text start="148.29" dur="4.199">continue for the rest of our lives and</text>
  <text start="150.66" dur="3.27">though I might always wistfully wonder</text>
  <text start="152.489" dur="3.511">what would have happened had I continued</text>
  <text start="153.93" dur="6.02">in the ministry those days were a</text>
  <text start="156" dur="6.95">distant shadow then one late summer day</text>
  <text start="159.95" dur="5.53">Yahweh gave us a very rude wake-up call</text>
  <text start="162.95" dur="4.509">it changed everything</text>
  <text start="165.48" dur="3.75">I just put the children down for a nap</text>
  <text start="167.459" dur="4.051">when Annika pulled into the dusty</text>
  <text start="169.23" dur="3.869">driveway the hot dryness of elite</text>
  <text start="171.51" dur="3.6">California summer had turned all our</text>
  <text start="173.099" dur="3.871">grass into brilliant yellow but the</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="4.409">ponderosa pines still tower didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="176.97" dur="5.28">change in green carrying Miriam into the</text>
  <text start="179.519" dur="6.241">house Annika love distressed hey honey</text>
  <text start="182.25" dur="5.76">everything okay well she said i just</text>
  <text start="185.76" dur="3.66">paid our rent for the month i watched on</text>
  <text start="188.01" dur="5.039">i could place the sleeping miriam into</text>
  <text start="189.42" dur="5.01">her mini crib oh good how&amp;#39;d that go my</text>
  <text start="193.049" dur="3.901">wife rose to her feet and locked her</text>
  <text start="194.43" dur="3.869">gaze me it looks like our landlords want</text>
  <text start="196.95" dur="4.58">to move this trailer and build a house</text>
  <text start="198.299" dur="6.27">here we have to be gone in 30 days in</text>
  <text start="201.53" dur="5.14">stared at her in shock all my feelings</text>
  <text start="204.569" dur="4.081">of contentment and peace shattered with</text>
  <text start="206.67" dur="3.39">a way to those words and I gripped the</text>
  <text start="208.65" dur="4.679">top of the chair in front of me to study</text>
  <text start="210.06" dur="5.31">myself my first reaction was denial are</text>
  <text start="213.329" dur="3.66">you sure about this ha how can I do this</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="4.29">they can&amp;#39;t just kick us out Kenley I</text>
  <text start="216.989" dur="4.321">could see the pain in his eyes for she</text>
  <text start="219.66" dur="3.719">loved this peaceful country spot just as</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="3.63">much as I did it&amp;#39;s nothing against</text>
  <text start="223.379" dur="3.121">that&amp;#39;s Daniel they&amp;#39;ve just always had a</text>
  <text start="224.94" dur="2.99">dream of building here so we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="226.5" dur="4.23">have to find a new place to live I</text>
  <text start="227.93" dur="4.72">reached over to embrace my wife okay</text>
  <text start="230.73" dur="4.979">okay fine we&amp;#39;ll just find another place</text>
  <text start="232.65" dur="4.89">up here no big deal but even as I said</text>
  <text start="235.709" dur="4.201">the words I couldn&amp;#39;t ignore the sinking</text>
  <text start="237.54" dur="4.199">feeling in the heart after all it had</text>
  <text start="239.91" dur="3.78">been a virtual miracle that we had</text>
  <text start="241.739" dur="4.051">secured this place at all real estate</text>
  <text start="243.69" dur="4.32">and mariposa was rare the tiny confines</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="4.33">of the town nearly impossible to find</text>
  <text start="248.01" dur="4.119">the rural outlying area where he lived</text>
  <text start="250.12" dur="3.33">for the next two weeks I frantically</text>
  <text start="252.129" dur="3.181">searched the classifieds and called as</text>
  <text start="253.45" dur="4.319">many rentals as I could so they could</text>
  <text start="255.31" dur="4.38">hold on to our Mariposa dream of the few</text>
  <text start="257.769" dur="4.231">openings I could find it already been</text>
  <text start="259.69" dur="3.78">rented I finally managed to find one</text>
  <text start="262" dur="2.82">place that was a few hundred dollars</text>
  <text start="263.47" dur="3.14">more than what we were currently paying</text>
  <text start="264.82" dur="4.59">and there was no way we could afford it</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="4.54">late one Saturday night shabbat over on</text>
  <text start="269.41" dur="4.05">our little ones sleeping i sat down with</text>
  <text start="271.15" dur="4.41">annika pulling out some paper a couple</text>
  <text start="273.46" dur="3.45">of pens and a calculator we looked at</text>
  <text start="275.56" dur="3.72">our budget trying to figure out what we</text>
  <text start="276.91" dur="4.2">should do we briefly toyed with the idea</text>
  <text start="279.28" dur="2.97">of returning to portland but we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="281.11" dur="2.61">want to just give up on her house</text>
  <text start="282.25" dur="3.389">cutting business that we poured all our</text>
  <text start="283.72" dur="4.02">sweat blood and tears into for the past</text>
  <text start="285.639" dur="3.961">two years with less than two weeks</text>
  <text start="287.74" dur="3.299">before we had to vacate our house we</text>
  <text start="289.6" dur="3.539">realize that we wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to stay</text>
  <text start="291.039" dur="4.951">in Mariposa there was simply nothing</text>
  <text start="293.139" dur="4.621">opening up fast enough I think we should</text>
  <text start="295.99" dur="4.11">look for a place in the valley Annika</text>
  <text start="297.76" dur="3.93">said his we&amp;#39;re crunching the numbers as</text>
  <text start="300.1" dur="3.87">much as I hated to admit it her advice</text>
  <text start="301.69" dur="4.289">made the most sense all of our house</text>
  <text start="303.97" dur="3.33">telling clients were down the valley so</text>
  <text start="305.979" dur="3.241">he would save a couple hundred dollars a</text>
  <text start="307.3" dur="3.78">month in gas we knew there were a</text>
  <text start="309.22" dur="3.33">gazillion and one places to rent down to</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="3.3">the valley and there was simply not</text>
  <text start="312.55" dur="4.11">enough time to explore any other options</text>
  <text start="314.38" dur="4.08">at Monday after we finished cleaning</text>
  <text start="316.66" dur="3.479">houses for the day we applied to a very</text>
  <text start="318.46" dur="3.9">nice townhome that was about what we</text>
  <text start="320.139" dur="3.811">have been spending in Mariposa as much</text>
  <text start="322.36" dur="3.84">as I dreaded living down the polluted</text>
  <text start="323.95" dur="4.89">hot San Joaquin Valley at least this red</text>
  <text start="326.2" dur="5.04">to look very nice but a few days later</text>
  <text start="328.84" dur="4.259">we were turned down because our</text>
  <text start="331.24" dur="4.59">bankruptcy it occurred so recently they</text>
  <text start="333.099" dur="5.04">would not allow us to qualify depressed</text>
  <text start="335.83" dur="3.899">beyond belief our sad little family</text>
  <text start="338.139" dur="3.39">drove up in the mountains</text>
  <text start="339.729" dur="4.62">with only about a week and a half until</text>
  <text start="341.529" dur="4.44">we had to move after we arrived home I</text>
  <text start="344.349" dur="3.81">took the long walk down our country</text>
  <text start="345.969" dur="3.991">drive to check the mail as I pulled out</text>
  <text start="348.159" dur="3.9">a few pieces of junk fliers the hot</text>
  <text start="349.96" dur="4.579">California Sun beating down on my back I</text>
  <text start="352.059" dur="7.17">suddenly very angrily cried out to ya</text>
  <text start="354.539" dur="6.94">why are you doing this to us why walking</text>
  <text start="359.229" dur="5.16">back up the hill tears streamed down my</text>
  <text start="361.479" dur="5.16">face the idyllic countryside dissolved</text>
  <text start="364.389" dur="4.471">in the watery frustration around my</text>
  <text start="366.639" dur="5.041">thoughts were a blur I love this place</text>
  <text start="368.86" dur="5.039">you love it so why do you feel you have</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="4.229">to rip it away from me like this and we</text>
  <text start="373.899" dur="3.75">can&amp;#39;t even find another place to go what</text>
  <text start="375.909" dur="2.931">do you want from us what do you want for</text>
  <text start="377.649" dur="4.191">me</text>
  <text start="378.84" dur="5.64">but I knew what y&amp;#39;all wanted he wanted</text>
  <text start="381.84" dur="5.13">me to come out of my cozy cave and my</text>
  <text start="384.48" dur="5.73">tears though bitter soon became tears of</text>
  <text start="386.97" dur="6.509">resignation I could not fight my master</text>
  <text start="390.21" dur="4.98">anymore over the next couple of days</text>
  <text start="393.479" dur="4.171">we&amp;#39;ve had a duplex in the valley that</text>
  <text start="395.19" dur="4.259">was not in the best part of town in fact</text>
  <text start="397.65" dur="3.98">the nicest way to describe the area</text>
  <text start="399.449" dur="4.53">could be summed up in one word trashing</text>
  <text start="401.63" dur="3.759">but when we met the manager he liked us</text>
  <text start="403.979" dur="2.731">immediately and didn&amp;#39;t seem to have a</text>
  <text start="405.389" dur="3.721">problem with our bankruptcy being</text>
  <text start="406.71" dur="4.2">discharged a year ago sighing with</text>
  <text start="409.11" dur="3.54">disappointment not liking out run down</text>
  <text start="410.91" dur="3.099">everything looked i led my family toward</text>
  <text start="412.65" dur="3.129">the only available</text>
  <text start="414.009" dur="4.41">as the owner open the door I caught my</text>
  <text start="415.779" dur="5.13">breath from shock a new carpet had just</text>
  <text start="418.419" dur="5.43">been installed all the days before the</text>
  <text start="420.909" dur="5.01">walls gleam of fresh white paint all the</text>
  <text start="423.849" dur="3.54">appliances of the newly first the</text>
  <text start="425.919" dur="2.881">three-bedroom home was much bigger than</text>
  <text start="427.389" dur="3.541">the single wide trailer we agree on</text>
  <text start="428.8" dur="4.829">accustomed to my opposing the place</text>
  <text start="430.93" dur="4.169">looked amazing as onic and i began to</text>
  <text start="433.629" dur="3.15">peek our heads in each room our</text>
  <text start="435.099" dur="3.331">excitement on the group from the</text>
  <text start="436.779" dur="3.211">bathrooms to the baseboards this</text>
  <text start="438.43" dur="3.689">dwelling was actually cleaner and nicer</text>
  <text start="439.99" dur="4.649">town we&amp;#39;ve been turned down from him</text>
  <text start="442.119" dur="4.561">it&amp;#39;s unbelievable I whispered Annika</text>
  <text start="444.639" dur="4.68">this area of town seems to be a complete</text>
  <text start="446.68" dur="6.359">dump but this place is amazing I know</text>
  <text start="449.319" dur="4.921">she agreed and there&amp;#39;s so much space the</text>
  <text start="453.039" dur="4.77">owner found is toward the back of the</text>
  <text start="454.24" dur="6.209">duplex well you want to apply absolutely</text>
  <text start="457.809" dur="4.59">we both said less than 24 hours after</text>

  <text start="464.289" dur="3.6">left before we had to be out of our</text>
  <text start="465.58" dur="4.559">mariposa trailer we got the call that we</text>
  <text start="467.889" dur="3.75">had been approved as we scurried to</text>
  <text start="470.139" dur="3.42">start packing everything and cleaning</text>
  <text start="471.639" dur="3.24">out the trailer the realization dawned</text>
  <text start="473.559" dur="3.42">on us that as much as we had cherished</text>
  <text start="474.879" dur="3.75">living in these secluded mountains the</text>
  <text start="476.979" dur="4.47">move to the valley was going to bless us</text>
  <text start="478.629" dur="4.44">in significant ways financially we&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="481.449" dur="4.171">saving over two hundred dollars a month</text>
  <text start="483.069" dur="5.041">on gas we were going to have triple the</text>
  <text start="485.62" dur="3.75">space we had to enjoy to mariposa and</text>
  <text start="488.11" dur="3.419">for the same rent that we&amp;#39;ve been paying</text>
