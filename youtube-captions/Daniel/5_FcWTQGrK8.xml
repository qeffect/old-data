  <text start="7.01" dur="6.039">februari 17 2013 and we&amp;#39;re now</text>
  <text start="10.08" dur="9.539">continuing an hour Hebrew study going to</text>
  <text start="13.049" dur="10.261">Hebrews chapter 10 eaters chapter 10 for</text>
  <text start="19.619" dur="6.961">the Torah having a shadow of good things</text>
  <text start="23.31" dur="5.639">to come and not the very image of those</text>
  <text start="26.58" dur="3.959">things can never with those sacrifices</text>
  <text start="28.949" dur="4.38">which they offered year by year</text>
  <text start="30.539" dur="5.971">continually make the comers there unto</text>
  <text start="33.329" dur="5.881">perfect and of course we know that when</text>
  <text start="36.51" dur="5.639">this Torah was originally designed and</text>
  <text start="39.21" dur="5.61">given to Moses on Sinai that those</text>
  <text start="42.149" dur="5.43">sacrifices were never intended to make</text>
  <text start="44.82" dur="5.669">anyone perfect those sacrifices were</text>
  <text start="47.579" dur="5.281">always always designed to point toward</text>
  <text start="50.489" dur="4.111">the coming Messiah that was their only</text>
  <text start="52.86" dur="3.6">purpose that&amp;#39;s always been their purpose</text>
  <text start="54.6" dur="3.869">and in the Millennial Kingdom when</text>
  <text start="56.46" dur="4.56">Yahshua rules and reigns for a thousand</text>
  <text start="58.469" dur="4.951">years and those sacrifices are done once</text>
  <text start="61.02" dur="4.56">again as we read about in Zechariah 14</text>
  <text start="63.42" dur="3.72">and the last four chapters of Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="65.58" dur="4.17">and in many other passages throughout</text>
  <text start="67.14" dur="6.45">the Tanach we see that those sacrifices</text>
  <text start="69.75" dur="6.299">will point back toward the very image of</text>
  <text start="73.59" dur="6.24">what happened back toward yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="76.049" dur="6.331">sacrifice on the tree on the Mount of</text>
  <text start="79.83" dur="4.109">Olives that that&amp;#39;s the only purpose</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="3.27">these sacrifices have ever had is to</text>
  <text start="83.939" dur="3.93">point toward the very image of the</text>
  <text start="85.65" dur="5.609">things which is Yahshua himself giving</text>
  <text start="87.869" dur="5.281">himself as a ransom for many for then</text>
  <text start="91.259" dur="4.021">would they not have ceased to be offered</text>
  <text start="93.15" dur="4.14">verse 2 because that the worshippers</text>
  <text start="95.28" dur="4.949">once purged should have had no more</text>
  <text start="97.29" dur="4.95">conscience of sins but in those</text>
  <text start="100.229" dur="4.861">sacrifices there&amp;#39;s remembrance again</text>
  <text start="102.24" dur="5.01">made of sins every year what is not</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="5.04">possible than the blood of bulls and of</text>
  <text start="107.25" dur="4.38">goats should take away sins so again the</text>
  <text start="110.13" dur="3.449">authors just reiterating that you know</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="3.87">it was never never designed never</text>
  <text start="113.579" dur="3.36">intended it&amp;#39;s not even possible it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="115.5" dur="4.53">even within the realm of possibility</text>
  <text start="116.939" dur="4.71">that the shedding of bulls and goats the</text>
  <text start="120.03" dur="2.909">shedding of blood of bulls and goats and</text>
  <text start="121.649" dur="3.061">lambs and all the other animals that</text>
  <text start="122.939" dur="4.381">were sacrificed in the Levitical</text>
  <text start="124.71" dur="6.12">sacrificial system could ever wipe away</text>
  <text start="127.32" dur="4.84">our past transgressions in terms of</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="4.72">cleansing our conscience</text>
  <text start="132.16" dur="4.65">just wasn&amp;#39;t couldn&amp;#39;t do that only the</text>
  <text start="135.55" dur="4.44">blood of Yahshua could do that</text>
  <text start="136.81" dur="5.31">nevertheless those sacrifices were</text>
  <text start="139.99" dur="4.83">instituted are instituted and will be</text>
  <text start="142.12" dur="4.83">instituted again why to point toward</text>
  <text start="144.82" dur="5.13">what Yahshua has done because his blood</text>
  <text start="146.95" dur="5.07">is sufficient to purge our conscience to</text>
  <text start="149.95" dur="6.38">set us free so that we can live holy and</text>
  <text start="152.02" dur="7.17">love him with everything in us wherefore</text>
  <text start="156.33" dur="5.29">when Yahshua comes into the world he</text>
  <text start="159.19" dur="5.13">says sacrifice and offering thou</text>
  <text start="161.62" dur="5.07">wouldest not but a body has that</text>
  <text start="164.32" dur="6.17">prepared me in burnt offerings and</text>
  <text start="166.69" dur="7.17">sacrifices for sin thou had no pleasure</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="5.68">then said i lo I come in the volume of</text>
  <text start="173.86" dur="7.53">the book it is written of me to do thy</text>
  <text start="176.17" dur="6.72">will o yah above when he said sacrifice</text>
  <text start="181.39" dur="4.44">and offering and burnt offerings and</text>
  <text start="182.89" dur="5.28">offerings for sin that was not neither</text>
  <text start="185.83" dur="5.19">has pleasure therein which are offered</text>
  <text start="188.17" dur="5.76">by the Torah then said he&amp;#39;ll oh I come</text>
  <text start="191.02" dur="5.07">to do thy will oh yeah he takes away the</text>
  <text start="193.93" dur="4.47">first that he may establish the second</text>
  <text start="196.09" dur="5.21">by the which will we are sanctified</text>
  <text start="198.4" dur="6.93">through the offering of the body of</text>
  <text start="201.3" dur="5.98">Yahshua HaMashiach once and for all so</text>
  <text start="205.33" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s very clear that only the body only</text>
  <text start="207.28" dur="6.72">the broken bruised body and shedding of</text>
  <text start="210.28" dur="5.82">his blood of yahshua&amp;#39;s blood could the</text>
  <text start="214" dur="4.05">appropriate sacrifice be given that</text>
  <text start="216.1" dur="6.62">would truly bring pleasure to the heart</text>
  <text start="218.05" dur="7.77">of yah in terms of atoning for sin</text>
  <text start="222.72" dur="4.57">because again the sacrifice of the</text>
  <text start="225.82" dur="5.91">animals could never end were never</text>
  <text start="227.29" dur="7.11">designed to do that verse 11 and every</text>
  <text start="231.73" dur="5.13">priest stands daily ministering and</text>
  <text start="234.4" dur="4.589">offering oftentimes the same sacrifices</text>
  <text start="236.86" dur="3.48">which can never take away since that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.989" dur="2.461">why they have to be repeated over and</text>
  <text start="240.34" dur="2.73">over again that&amp;#39;s why they have to be</text>
  <text start="241.45" dur="3.42">done over and over again that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="243.07" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s every day there are ablations</text>
  <text start="244.87" dur="4.41">and their offerings done sometimes many</text>
  <text start="247.57" dur="4.04">times multiple times throughout the day</text>
  <text start="249.28" dur="5.88">because they&amp;#39;re not sufficient to</text>
  <text start="251.61" dur="5.14">cleanse sin only Yahshua sacrifice was</text>
  <text start="255.16" dur="5.49">sufficient that&amp;#39;s why it only had to be</text>
  <text start="256.75" dur="6.66">done once but this man verse 12 but this</text>
  <text start="260.65" dur="5.07">man after he had offered one sacrifice</text>
  <text start="263.41" dur="5.37">for sins forever</text>
  <text start="265.72" dur="5.28">sat down on the right hand of yah from</text>
  <text start="268.78" dur="4.29">henceforth expecting tills enemies be</text>
  <text start="271" dur="4.17">made his foot still so notice that even</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="4.53">though yahoo has already been sacrificed</text>
  <text start="275.17" dur="4.08">already resurrected and is now seated at</text>
  <text start="277.6" dur="3.72">the right hand of yah as of the writing</text>
  <text start="279.25" dur="4.2">of this book of Hebrews the author is</text>
  <text start="281.32" dur="3.75">still showing in verse 11 that the</text>
  <text start="283.45" dur="3.81">priests are still daily ministering</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re still offering the sacrifices</text>
  <text start="287.26" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s not like those sacrifices ended</text>
  <text start="289.03" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s not like those oblation cease to</text>
  <text start="290.92" dur="3.93">have any meaning or purpose because</text>
  <text start="293.29" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re still being offered even as the</text>
  <text start="294.85" dur="3.96">the writing of this book and they will</text>
  <text start="296.35" dur="4.35">be offered again during the millennial</text>
  <text start="298.81" dur="3.99">kingdom so it&amp;#39;s not that they ceased in</text>
  <text start="300.7" dur="4.98">having purpose it&amp;#39;s just that the author</text>
  <text start="302.8" dur="5.94">is showing the contrast between the</text>
  <text start="305.68" dur="4.95">purpose of the animal sacrifices and the</text>
  <text start="308.74" dur="3.72">purpose of yahshua sacrifice that there</text>
  <text start="310.63" dur="4.65">there are two separate things one is a</text>
  <text start="312.46" dur="5.52">shadow one is the real thing one was</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="4.98">never designed to atone for sins or to</text>
  <text start="317.98" dur="4.32">purge the conscience one does purse the</text>
  <text start="320.26" dur="3.78">conscience one has to be offered over</text>
  <text start="322.3" dur="3.45">and over again because it&amp;#39;s a constant</text>
  <text start="324.04" dur="3.629">shadow picture showing things the other</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="3.6">only has to be offered once so he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="327.669" dur="4.891">showing the contrast between the two</text>
  <text start="329.35" dur="5.25">he&amp;#39;s not saying that one is now done</text>
  <text start="332.56" dur="3.33">away with and this other one has now</text>
  <text start="334.6" dur="2.97">replaced he&amp;#39;s not saying that at all</text>
  <text start="335.89" dur="3.84">although that will happen eventually</text>
  <text start="337.57" dur="3.63">again when we get to the end of the</text>
  <text start="339.73" dur="3.63">Millennial Kingdom and the new heavens</text>
  <text start="341.2" dur="5.69">new earth the one part of tour that will</text>
  <text start="343.36" dur="9.09">pass away is this entire Levitical</text>
  <text start="346.89" dur="7.06">sacrificial system and verse 13 also I</text>
  <text start="352.45" dur="3.6">just want to highlight that again also</text>
  <text start="353.95" dur="3.96">from henceforth expecting tills enemies</text>
  <text start="356.05" dur="4.23">be made his foot still so notice that as</text>
  <text start="357.91" dur="4.53">of the writing of Hebrews long after the</text>
  <text start="360.28" dur="4.5">resurrection not all of yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="362.44" dur="4.62">enemies have been put under his feet yet</text>
  <text start="364.78" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;ve started to be put under his feet</text>
  <text start="367.06" dur="4.2">they started it at when he rose again</text>
  <text start="369.22" dur="4.44">when you resurrected but not everything</text>
  <text start="371.26" dur="5.04">has been put under his feet for instance</text>
  <text start="373.66" dur="4.44">death has not yet been totally put under</text>
  <text start="376.3" dur="3.57">his feet because death still rules and</text>

  <text start="463.669" dur="4.291">of the Holy Spirit and it&amp;#39;s spelled out</text>
  <text start="465.05" dur="5.04">very clearly right here and of course</text>
  <text start="467.96" dur="6.81">this is also reiterated very very</text>
  <text start="470.09" dur="7.65">clearly in Ezekiel 1119 through 20 z ql</text>
  <text start="474.77" dur="6.06">prophesize of what&amp;#39;s being fulfilled in</text>
  <text start="477.74" dur="6.39">the book of Hebrews when Ezekiel says in</text>

  <text start="527.97" dur="5.82">out here in those verses in Hebrews 10</text>
  <text start="530.779" dur="4.721">and again in verse 17 and I covered this</text>
  <text start="533.79" dur="3.33">in a couple chapters ago because he made</text>
