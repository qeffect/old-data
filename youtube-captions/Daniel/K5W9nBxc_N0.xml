  <text start="0.03" dur="3.3">well everyone so I&amp;#39;m here at the</text>
  <text start="1.589" dur="4.681">creation Science Museum it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="3.33" dur="5.46">closing her soon but I found a really</text>
  <text start="6.27" dur="5.699">good resource of information about the</text>
  <text start="8.79" dur="11.399">faultiness of radiometric dating and</text>
  <text start="11.969" dur="13.351">just some examples here see here was it</text>
  <text start="20.189" dur="7.08">oh yeah when a sample of lava in the</text>
  <text start="25.32" dur="5.19">Mount st. Helens crater had been served</text>
  <text start="27.269" dur="6.511">to form and cool in 1986 was analyzed in</text>
  <text start="30.51" dur="7.04">1996 it contains so much argon for that</text>
  <text start="33.78" dur="6.18">it had a calculated age of 350,000 years</text>
  <text start="37.55" dur="4.259">so a sample they had taken that was</text>
  <text start="39.96" dur="6.66">literally formed in 1986 said it was</text>
  <text start="41.809" dur="6.52">350,000 years so these these dating</text>
  <text start="46.62" dur="4.25">methods that evolutionists use to prove</text>
  <text start="48.329" dur="7.531">that the world is billions of years old</text>
  <text start="50.87" dur="7.59">it&amp;#39;s faulty I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of time</text>
  <text start="55.86" dur="7.17">here otherwise I would record a lot more</text>
  <text start="58.46" dur="7.63">but just a lot of information about why</text>
  <text start="63.03" dur="9.54">the earth is actually 6,000 years old</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="9.69">not billions of years old got a Grand</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="4.92">Canyon room in here this is a great</text>
  <text start="75.78" dur="6.05">place if you ever have a chance to visit</text>
  <text start="77.49" dur="4.34">it there&amp;#39;s explains about the ice ages</text>
  <text start="82.7" dur="7.9">chapping right after the flood this is</text>
  <text start="88.53" dur="3.99">the Creation Museum science in San Diego</text>
  <text start="90.6" dur="6.54">now here they have a replica of the</text>
  <text start="92.52" dur="9.69">Tower of Babel the tower Babel they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="97.14" dur="6.72">building it the first city built after</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="3.81">the flood was established at Babel or</text>
  <text start="103.86" dur="4.14">Babylon and opposition to God&amp;#39;s command</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="3.9">to fill the earth this became the</text>

  <text start="114.54" dur="4.649">prototype ball later ziggurats and</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="4.2">pyramids was built to unify the culture</text>
  <text start="119.189" dur="4.201">and religion of the people in a system</text>
  <text start="121.29" dur="4.829">of evolutionary pantheism which also</text>
  <text start="123.39" dur="5.42">involved polytheistic idolatry astrology</text>
  <text start="126.119" dur="5.07">and cold spiritism and child sex</text>

  <text start="138.079" dur="12.94">cool this is such an amazing Museum oh I</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="3.479">wanted to show the different there was</text>
  <text start="151.019" dur="3.571">in the flood area they were showing how</text>
  <text start="152.879" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s over 200 different legends of</text>
  <text start="154.59" dur="4.64">the flood that are very similar to what</text>
  <text start="156.569" dur="5.911">the Bible states here of courses</text>
  <text start="159.23" dur="7.089">Joshua&amp;#39;s death and resurrection it goes</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="6.45">to the whole history of the earth but I</text>
  <text start="166.319" dur="6.301">wanted to go over here for all the</text>
  <text start="168.93" dur="5.91">Patriots out there the fact that our</text>
  <text start="172.62" dur="3.929">nation was established on a creationist</text>
  <text start="174.84" dur="3.179">foundation as evident not only from many</text>
  <text start="176.549" dur="2.461">of the writings of the founding fathers</text>
  <text start="178.019" dur="3.3">but from the Declaration of Independence</text>
  <text start="179.01" dur="4.259">itself note the references in the</text>
  <text start="181.319" dur="3.63">Declaration to nature&amp;#39;s God the supreme</text>
  <text start="183.269" dur="3.78">judge of the world divine providence</text>
  <text start="184.949" dur="3.6">their Creator than others the very</text>
  <text start="187.049" dur="4.34">beginning it affirms that all men are</text>
  <text start="188.549" dur="2.84">created equal</text>
  <text start="198.54" dur="6.169">and they talk about various creationists</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="3.559">throughout the hip without the ages</text>
  <text start="230.45" dur="5.71">these are evolutionists so these are</text>
  <text start="232.59" dur="9.63">evolutionists they have over here and</text>
  <text start="236.16" dur="9.18">these are creationist I have a whole</text>
  <text start="242.22" dur="9.27">section on the human cell and it&amp;#39;s utter</text>
  <text start="245.34" dur="7.95">design at least I mean this museum is</text>
  <text start="251.49" dur="4.14">vast I got you right after two o&amp;#39;clock</text>

  <text start="257.88" dur="3">back here</text>
  <text start="258.77" dur="4.6">fair enough well time to come back here</text>
  <text start="260.88" dur="5.49">with my preaching schedule but I mean</text>
  <text start="263.37" dur="5.46">this museum is just vast here they show</text>
  <text start="266.37" dur="10.14">where the different sons of Noah travel</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="15.03">to you got Shem and purple ham and green</text>
  <text start="276.51" dur="13.56">and Japheth in orange or red of course</text>
  <text start="283.86" dur="9.12">Shem is the bravery came from I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="290.07" dur="5.27">show the flood one so these different</text>
  <text start="292.98" dur="2.36">legends</text>
  <text start="296.31" dur="8.98">and this age of the earth section two is</text>
  <text start="299.32" dur="8.1">really really good as you&amp;#39;re so mature</text>
  <text start="305.29" dur="8.79">though it&amp;#39;s hard to digest at all at</text>
  <text start="307.42" dur="10.05">least in a short period of time it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="7.56">Grand Canyon shows how it formed very</text>
  <text start="317.47" dur="7.25">quickly through the flood oh there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="321.64" dur="7.02">really good section on Mount st. Helens</text>
  <text start="324.72" dur="9.21">and how it proves how you know multiple</text>
  <text start="328.66" dur="8.34">layers in the earth can form very</text>
  <text start="333.93" dur="12.67">quickly and they use not same a little</text>
  <text start="337" dur="14.37">bit Genesis flood that was part carry on</text>
  <text start="346.6" dur="7.68">this is where it is oh here we go yeah</text>
  <text start="351.37" dur="4.8">flood histories so traditions of the</text>
  <text start="354.28" dur="3.33">flood have been found among over 200</text>
  <text start="356.17" dur="4.08">tribes and ancient nations all over the</text>
  <text start="357.61" dur="4.62">world all preserving some aspects of the</text>
  <text start="360.25" dur="4.05">authoritative authoritative record in</text>
  <text start="362.23" dur="4.41">Genesis but is started through many</text>
  <text start="364.3" dur="3.54">centuries of world transmission yeah so</text>
  <text start="366.64" dur="3.39">these other stores are distorted whereas</text>
  <text start="367.84" dur="4.56">the Bible is true because it&amp;#39;s not oral</text>
  <text start="370.03" dur="5.04">it was preserved by God as a written</text>
  <text start="372.4" dur="4.11">word all these stories antedate the</text>
  <text start="375.07" dur="3.33">arrival of Christian missionaries in the</text>
  <text start="376.51" dur="3.12">various regions so must have been</text>
  <text start="378.4" dur="2.76">preserved since the earliest days of</text>
  <text start="379.63" dur="3.48">their history a few typical legends are</text>
  <text start="381.16" dur="4.14">noted here in the ark room so here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.11" dur="4.08">like one or actually this one was really</text>
  <text start="385.3" dur="3.36">cold the Hawaiians in the flood the</text>
  <text start="387.19" dur="4.89">Hawaiians say that long after the time</text>
  <text start="388.66" dur="5.76">of cumin ahora the first man the earth</text>
  <text start="392.08" dur="3.87">became wicked and careless of the</text>
  <text start="394.42" dur="3.15">worship of the gods one man was</text>
  <text start="395.95" dur="3.66">righteous knew which sounds very much</text>
  <text start="397.57" dur="4.23">like Noah he made a great canoe with a</text>
  <text start="399.61" dur="4.26">house on it and stored it with food</text>
  <text start="401.8" dur="3.57">taking plants and animals into it when</text>
  <text start="403.87" dur="3.3">the waters came up over all the earth</text>
  <text start="405.37" dur="4.32">and destroyed all of mankind except knew</text>
  <text start="407.17" dur="4.23">in his family when he came out upon the</text>
  <text start="409.69" dur="3.72">land after the waters had subsided he</text>
  <text start="411.4" dur="3.6">looked up and saw the moon I thought it</text>
  <text start="413.41" dur="3.81">was Cain the Great God so he worshiped</text>
  <text start="415" dur="3.99">it this displeased Cain and came down in</text>
  <text start="417.22" dur="3.18">a rainbow and were proved new but he did</text>
  <text start="418.99" dur="3.48">not punish him for knee would do this by</text>
  <text start="420.4" dur="3.57">mistake when he returned to the sky he</text>
  <text start="422.47" dur="3.78">left the rainbow behind it</text>
  <text start="423.97" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s forgiveness obviously this is not</text>
  <text start="426.25" dur="4.26">true but you can see all the different</text>
  <text start="427.99" dur="6.03">elements that are in the actual biblical</text>
  <text start="430.51" dur="4.89">account historical record the rainbow</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="6.35">the flood Noah the animals and</text>
  <text start="435.4" dur="4.97">everything model of the the art</text>
  <text start="447.23" dur="4.3">how did dinosaurs were dinosaurs too big</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="6.84">- on the ark no he just took baby</text>
  <text start="451.53" dur="7.53">dinosaurs anyway there&amp;#39;s just there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.93" dur="3.27">just so much it&amp;#39;s a painting of what it</text>
  <text start="459.06" dur="8.09">would have looked like inside the art</text>
  <text start="460.2" dur="9.09">the different animus there&amp;#39;s so much oh</text>
  <text start="467.15" dur="5.56">I wanted to so the thing about the soft</text>
  <text start="469.29" dur="7.91">tissue that really really does damage to</text>
  <text start="472.71" dur="4.49">the evolutionary theory</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="5.86">because it goes through all six days of</text>
  <text start="508.14" dur="6.33">creation back there and here&amp;#39;s the fall</text>
  <text start="510.72" dur="5.19">of man it talks about the second law of</text>
  <text start="514.47" dur="4.32">thermodynamics that things always go</text>
  <text start="515.91" dur="9.06">from stay of order to disorder things</text>
  <text start="518.79" dur="8.33">are D evolving not evolving it&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="524.97" dur="7.67">use a lot less of our brains and we did</text>
  <text start="527.12" dur="15.21">thousands of years ago where&amp;#39;s that part</text>
  <text start="532.64" dur="12.25">I think I&amp;#39;m gonna have to come back here</text>
  <text start="542.33" dur="5.01">there&amp;#39;s just so much here it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.89" dur="2.45">incredible</text>
  <text start="553.17" dur="9.55">and their faulty dating method that</text>
  <text start="555.79" dur="9.69">evolutions use ah here we go look at</text>
  <text start="562.72" dur="5.369">this evidence suppose 70 million year</text>
  <text start="565.48" dur="5.039">old tremors are tricep trace triana</text>

  <text start="575.019" dur="4.681">Montana is dated at 70 million years old</text>
  <text start="577.39" dur="3.9">supposedly right by the evolutions yet</text>
  <text start="579.7" dur="3.509">it is yielded soft tissue including</text>
  <text start="581.29" dur="4.41">blood vessels and perhaps even whole</text>
  <text start="583.209" dur="3.87">cells and protein because of this fine</text>
  <text start="585.7" dur="2.85">scientists are now beginning to take a</text>
  <text start="587.079" dur="3.781">look at the inside of many more</text>
  <text start="588.55" dur="4.38">fossilized dinosaur bones with the</text>

  <text start="595.35" dur="4.12">most evolutionists believe that the last</text>
  <text start="597.579" dur="4.291">dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years</text>
  <text start="599.47" dur="4.77">ago but is that what observe</text>
  <text start="601.87" dur="4.08">observational science tells us what</text>
  <text start="604.24" dur="3.659">develop fossils tell us about when the</text>
  <text start="605.95" dur="3.84">dinosaurs became extinct is it really</text>
  <text start="607.899" dur="4.231">possible for blood cells and soft tissue</text>
  <text start="609.79" dur="4.95">the last 65 million years or this t-rex</text>
  <text start="612.13" dur="5.61">really died only about 4,500 years ago</text>
