  <text start="2.639" dur="8.58">28th 2019 what the Americans call</text>
  <text start="7.189" dur="7.78">Thanksgiving Day but this year 2019</text>
  <text start="11.219" dur="5.791">today is also the ninth new moon this is</text>
  <text start="14.969" dur="4.201">the night Hebrew new moon that means</text>
  <text start="17.01" dur="3.5">it&amp;#39;s the first day of the night key word</text>
  <text start="19.17" dur="4.23">month in fact I just want to read</text>
  <text start="20.51" dur="6.189">something really quickly from Isaiah</text>
  <text start="23.4" dur="5.879">chapter 66 verse 23 this is actually</text>
  <text start="26.699" dur="4.201">talking about the Millennial Kingdom and</text>
  <text start="29.279" dur="3.96">then beyond the new heavens and new</text>
  <text start="30.9" dur="4.23">earth in the 8th millennium says and it</text>
  <text start="33.239" dur="4.59">shall come to pass that from one new</text>
  <text start="35.13" dur="5.249">moon to another and from one sabbath</text>
  <text start="37.829" dur="5.191">from one Shabbat to another shall all</text>
  <text start="40.379" dur="5.671">flesh come to worship before me saith</text>
  <text start="43.02" dur="3.75">Yahweh the new moons the new moons and</text>
  <text start="46.05" dur="2.489">the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="46.77" dur="3.6">of course Shabbat happens every week</text>
  <text start="48.539" dur="4.741">from Friday night to Saturday night it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="50.37" dur="5.7">a rest day New Moon&amp;#39;s kick off the month</text>
  <text start="53.28" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s the monthly time of coming before</text>
  <text start="56.07" dur="3.899">yah it&amp;#39;s not technically a Shabbat</text>
  <text start="57.75" dur="4.949">because we read in the scriptures that</text>
  <text start="59.969" dur="5.01">for instance in the book of Exodus they</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="5.041">actually reared the entire Tabernacle in</text>
  <text start="64.979" dur="4.5">the wilderness on the new moon which you</text>
  <text start="67.74" dur="4.919">would never do on a on a regular Sabbath</text>
  <text start="69.479" dur="5.161">and it&amp;#39;s also why the 7th new moon that</text>
  <text start="72.659" dur="3.991">typically happens in september/october</text>
  <text start="74.64" dur="5.1">depending on the year the 7th the moon</text>
  <text start="76.65" dur="4.85">is specified as a holy Sabbath a Shabbat</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="4.89">no matter what day that we could fall on</text>
  <text start="81.5" dur="5.14">because it is the it&amp;#39;s yom true it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="84.63" dur="3.27">Feast of Trumpets but today&amp;#39;s the 9th</text>
  <text start="86.64" dur="4.5">Tim in this is the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="87.9" dur="5.85">ninth 9:00 in scripture often symbolizes</text>
  <text start="91.14" dur="4.35">a judgment and judgment by the way we</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="3.42">kind of think at America that judgments</text>
  <text start="95.49" dur="4.019">negative judgment is not necessarily</text>
  <text start="97.17" dur="4.14">negative guys judgment comes on the</text>
  <text start="99.509" dur="4.411">righteous and the righteous are given a</text>
  <text start="101.31" dur="4.83">judgment which is a good judgment and</text>
  <text start="103.92" dur="3.96">good rewards and judgment comes on the</text>
  <text start="106.14" dur="3.24">wicked faith and they get their just</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="4.26">desserts so judgment can be either</text>
  <text start="109.38" dur="4.769">positive or negative depending on how we</text>
  <text start="112.14" dur="4.409">choose to live our lives are we going to</text>
  <text start="114.149" dur="4.411">forsake our sin and surrender fully to</text>
  <text start="116.549" dur="3.871">Jesus to Yahshua the Holy One of Israel</text>

  <text start="273.66" dur="5.61">by it by the Greek Empire but a small</text>
  <text start="275.94" dur="5.729">band of Maccabee and rebels up in the</text>
  <text start="279.27" dur="4.29">foothills they pledged themselves to yah</text>

  <text start="287.25" dur="3.9">become sort of the original American</text>
  <text start="289.62" dur="3.81">Revolution I know I&amp;#39;m being kind of</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="4.65">anachronistic there but if what would</text>
  <text start="293.43" dur="4.709">become you know the small group of</text>
  <text start="295.8" dur="4.86">rebels through the anointing of yah they</text>
  <text start="298.139" dur="4.441">wound up driving back the largest empire</text>
  <text start="300.66" dur="4.86">in history at the time the Greek Empire</text>
  <text start="302.58" dur="4.53">and then not only drove them back and</text>
  <text start="305.52" dur="3.99">defeated them and pushed them out of</text>
  <text start="307.11" dur="4.559">Judea in Israel but then they restored</text>
  <text start="309.51" dur="4.44">Israel and they rebuilt their temple and</text>
  <text start="311.669" dur="5.941">they cleansed it and they they purified</text>
  <text start="313.95" dur="7.62">it and it took a full eight days to</text>
  <text start="317.61" dur="5.58">rededicate and purify that temple but</text>
  <text start="321.57" dur="3.72">they overcame and possible as it I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="323.19" dur="4.26">get a lot more into this for Hanukkah</text>

  <text start="381.389" dur="3.571">people don&amp;#39;t understand is that that</text>
  <text start="383.19" dur="5.01">celebration that they were keeping in</text>
  <text start="384.96" dur="6.6">October of 1621 was actually the feast</text>

  <text start="418.59" dur="6.51">of 1621 they were celebrating the feast</text>
  <text start="420.63" dur="7.17">of Sukkot all right and and so because</text>

  <text start="427.8" dur="2.04">Jewish Hebrew roots of the Christian</text>
  <text start="429.54" dur="3.27">faith</text>

  <text start="574.23" dur="4.77">that stone is inscribed the Ten</text>
  <text start="576.72" dur="4.2">Commandments in ancient paleo Hebrew</text>
  <text start="579" dur="5.52">which was the earliest type of Hebrew</text>
  <text start="580.92" dur="4.65">used in ancient Israel and it&amp;#39;s you see</text>
  <text start="584.52" dur="2.43">you read right there it&amp;#39;s the ten</text>
  <text start="585.57" dur="3.03">commandments that you find in any King</text>
  <text start="586.95" dur="5.55">James Bible it&amp;#39;s written in paleo Hebrew</text>
  <text start="588.6" dur="6.39">stated about 3,000 BC so these were</text>
  <text start="592.5" dur="4.92">again Native Americans who they knew the</text>
  <text start="594.99" dur="4.11">of Israel they knew the commandments of</text>
  <text start="597.42" dur="3.75">course many of them had forsaken that</text>
  <text start="599.1" dur="4.5">and started worshiping the creation</text>
  <text start="601.17" dur="4.95">rather than the Creator unfortunately</text>
  <text start="603.6" dur="4.53">and so they got into a bunch of paganism</text>
  <text start="606.12" dur="4.11">but these Native Americans and these</text>
  <text start="608.13" dur="4.29">pilgrims knew enough of their Hebrew</text>
  <text start="610.23" dur="4.05">Jewish roots that they came together in</text>
  <text start="612.42" dur="4.11">peace and harmony to celebrate the feast</text>
  <text start="614.28" dur="3.78">of Sukkot which is very beautiful and</text>
  <text start="616.53" dur="6.36">that&amp;#39;s that was the first Thanksgiving</text>
  <text start="618.06" dur="5.97">now how did Thanksgiving wind up in you</text>
  <text start="622.89" dur="3.72">know on the last Thursday of November</text>
  <text start="624.03" dur="5.15">it&amp;#39;s because in the 1860s President</text>
  <text start="626.61" dur="4.56">Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation</text>
  <text start="629.18" dur="3.76">again traditionally this has been</text>
  <text start="631.17" dur="4.47">celebrated in October which is when the</text>
  <text start="632.94" dur="4.53">feast of Sukkot occurs right depending</text>
  <text start="635.64" dur="4.14">on the year spieces coat always happens</text>
  <text start="637.47" dur="4.05">in very late September or early to mid</text>
  <text start="639.78" dur="3.66">to even late October just depending on</text>
  <text start="641.52" dur="3.24">the year can happen anywhere from late</text>
  <text start="643.44" dur="3.27">September to late October depending on</text>
  <text start="644.76" dur="3.72">the year but but that&amp;#39;s what they were</text>
  <text start="646.71" dur="3.84">doing so Abraham Lincoln issued a</text>
  <text start="648.48" dur="5.43">proclamation where he actually moved the</text>
  <text start="650.55" dur="4.83">face of Thanksgiving from from October</text>
  <text start="653.91" dur="4.14">what it was being traditionally</text>
  <text start="655.38" dur="5.55">and Canada still keeps it to this day in</text>
  <text start="658.05" dur="6.03">October they moved it to the last</text>
  <text start="660.93" dur="5.16">Thursday in November now this was not</text>
  <text start="664.08" dur="3.69">necessarily a good thing what Abraham</text>
  <text start="666.09" dur="3.66">Lincoln did because if you go to the</text>
  <text start="667.77" dur="6.33">scriptures you actually find out that</text>
  <text start="669.75" dur="5.97">when Solomon died Israel had a civil war</text>
  <text start="674.1" dur="3.36">they split up and the ten northern</text>
  <text start="675.72" dur="4.65">tribes went to the north and they formed</text>
  <text start="677.46" dur="5.94">what would become Israel and then Judah</text>
  <text start="680.37" dur="4.68">Benjamin and Levi they stayed in the</text>
  <text start="683.4" dur="3.3">South around Jerusalem and they became</text>
  <text start="685.05" dur="3">Judah and there so there&amp;#39;s the house of</text>
  <text start="686.7" dur="3.51">Judah in the house of Israel there was a</text>
  <text start="688.05" dur="4.41">civil war well the house of Israel</text>
  <text start="690.21" dur="3.69">almost immediately became apostate they</text>
  <text start="692.46" dur="3">said we&amp;#39;re not gonna go to Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="693.9" dur="3.44">just to keep the feasts we&amp;#39;re gonna set</text>
  <text start="695.46" dur="4.59">up these pagan casts all this stuff and</text>
  <text start="697.34" dur="5.23">one of the first things that the first</text>
  <text start="700.05" dur="5.01">king of Israel that it now departed into</text>
  <text start="702.57" dur="3.87">apostasy did is he moved the feast days</text>
  <text start="705.06" dur="3.84">he didn&amp;#39;t want his people to go down to</text>
  <text start="706.44" dur="3.81">Jerusalem so he moved the feast days</text>
  <text start="708.9" dur="3.21">from the seventh month to the eighth</text>
  <text start="710.25" dur="4.29">month a month later so he literally</text>
  <text start="712.11" dur="3.36">moved so coat for instance from when it</text>
  <text start="714.54" dur="2.31">was supposed to be in the seventh month</text>
  <text start="715.47" dur="2.97">to a month later in the eighth month</text>
  <text start="716.85" dur="4.53">which of course was very evil and</text>
  <text start="718.44" dur="4.35">changing the Torah and when Abraham</text>
  <text start="721.38" dur="3.66">Lincoln even though I&amp;#39;m sure he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="722.79" dur="4.8">do this intentionally but when Abraham</text>
  <text start="725.04" dur="3.75">Lincoln issued this Proclamation to move</text>
  <text start="727.59" dur="5.73">Thanksgiving from what was traditionally</text>
  <text start="728.79" dur="6.3">kept by the pilgrims in October the time</text>
  <text start="733.32" dur="3.99">of Sukkot he moved it now to the last</text>
  <text start="735.09" dur="5.13">Thursday November he moved it a month</text>
  <text start="737.31" dur="4.77">later which which is exactly what that</text>
  <text start="740.22" dur="4.35">first evil king of Israel did when they</text>
  <text start="742.08" dur="4.47">had that civil war so not necessarily a</text>
  <text start="744.57" dur="5.13">good good thing I mean technically</text>
  <text start="746.55" dur="5.28">Thanksgiving the whole true Thanksgiving</text>
  <text start="749.7" dur="4.86">is Sokoto which you know me celebrated</text>
  <text start="751.83" dur="4.2">right I documented that on my on my</text>
  <text start="754.56" dur="4.02">videos here where I celebrated it down</text>
  <text start="756.03" dur="3.9">in Pagosa Springs Colorado and then I</text>
  <text start="758.58" dur="3.66">had a Q conference in Albuquerque New</text>
  <text start="759.93" dur="3.63">Mexico during that time so we did</text>
  <text start="762.24" dur="3.54">celebrate Thanksgiving it was an</text>
  <text start="763.56" dur="3.72">eight-day feast and and it is a Sukkot</text>
  <text start="765.78" dur="3.02">is all about Thanksgiving and looking</text>
  <text start="767.28" dur="4.85">toward the new heavens new earth</text>
  <text start="768.8" dur="5.53">nevertheless I think that the reason why</text>
  <text start="772.13" dur="4.45">Thanksgiving Day of all the holidays</text>
  <text start="774.33" dur="4.34">that Americans celebrate why</text>
  <text start="776.58" dur="4.86">Thanksgiving Day doesn&amp;#39;t have all those</text>
  <text start="778.67" dur="3.94">pagan commercialized trappings I mean</text>
  <text start="781.44" dur="2.85">think about it Christmas you know you</text>
  <text start="782.61" dur="3.87">got Santa Claus that it&amp;#39;s just so</text>
  <text start="784.29" dur="3.11">commercialized and of course Halloween</text>
  <text start="786.48" dur="2.87">is you know</text>
  <text start="787.4" dur="3.54">very commercialized as well in fact they</text>
  <text start="789.35" dur="3.62">start packing the stories of Halloween</text>
  <text start="790.94" dur="4.08">stuff like right after Labor Day now</text>
  <text start="792.97" dur="3.37">that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m gonna store in August</text>
  <text start="795.02" dur="3.45">that started packing stuff with how is</text>
  <text start="796.34" dur="3.36">sick Easter of course you got the Easter</text>
  <text start="798.47" dur="3.03">Bunny you got all this commercialism</text>
  <text start="799.7" dur="3.57">around these very pagan holidays but</text>
  <text start="801.5" dur="3.72">with Thanksgiving you don&amp;#39;t really have</text>
  <text start="803.27" dur="3.66">that commercialism you really don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="805.22" dur="4.2">mean you have the big turkey you know</text>
  <text start="806.93" dur="3.96">the president Trump pardons the turkey</text>
  <text start="809.42" dur="3.12">and you have that you know the</text>
  <text start="810.89" dur="3.21">Thanksgiving Parade the Macy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="812.54" dur="3.33">Thanksgiving Day Parade but there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="814.1" dur="3.78">a lot of commercialism that surrounds</text>
  <text start="815.87" dur="3.8">the Thanksgiving holiday there&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="817.88" dur="4.41">lot of stress something Thanksgiving is</text>
  <text start="819.67" dur="4.45">you get this long weekend and you gather</text>
  <text start="822.29" dur="7.38">with friends and family and you cook</text>
  <text start="824.12" dur="8.84">this huge feast in fact my wife and I we</text>
  <text start="829.67" dur="6.27">actually got it was the last free-range</text>
  <text start="832.96" dur="4.3">free-range organic turkey that the</text>
  <text start="835.94" dur="6.6">grocery store had here in Juneau is the</text>
  <text start="837.26" dur="8.22">last one we actually got this so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="842.54" dur="5">not a lot of commercialism for this and</text>
  <text start="845.48" dur="4.56">I think it&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s rooted in</text>
  <text start="847.54" dur="3.61">Sokoto it&amp;#39;s rooted in actually Hebrew</text>
  <text start="850.04" dur="2.52">feast day that was what the first</text>
  <text start="851.15" dur="2.88">Thanksgiving was all about and a lot of</text>
  <text start="852.56" dur="3.21">people don&amp;#39;t know about this there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="854.03" dur="4.92">actually a great book that I want to</text>

  <text start="903.65" dur="5.25">that a lot of the founding fathers of</text>
  <text start="906.02" dur="4.38">the 1770s tended to be Dias which means</text>
  <text start="908.9" dur="2.71">they believed that yaahh was sort of a</text>
  <text start="910.4" dur="2.89">distant and</text>
  <text start="911.61" dur="4.11">t-that kind of just you know is very</text>
  <text start="913.29" dur="4.11">stoic but some of the founding fathers</text>
  <text start="915.72" dur="3.45">really did love Yahshua they really did</text>
  <text start="917.4" dur="3.36">love ya for instance I learned at</text>
  <text start="919.17" dur="2.76">Colonial Williamsburg that I was at a</text>
  <text start="920.76" dur="3.39">couple weeks ago when I had my Q</text>
  <text start="921.93" dur="4.71">conference in Richmond Virginia colonial</text>
  <text start="924.15" dur="8.22">ensberg I learned that Thomas Jefferson</text>
  <text start="926.64" dur="8.16">and I came from the other guy&amp;#39;s name the</text>
  <text start="932.37" dur="4.35">Patrick Henry de Chavez Jefferson</text>
  <text start="934.8" dur="3.84">Patrick Henry who you know well before</text>
  <text start="936.72" dur="2.58">Thomas jeffer never ever ever became</text>
  <text start="938.64" dur="3.66">president</text>
  <text start="939.3" dur="4.62">they were both actually the Patrick</text>
  <text start="942.3" dur="2.82">Henry and then later Thomas Jefferson</text>
  <text start="943.92" dur="4.65">for a brief time were actually governors</text>
  <text start="945.12" dur="6.03">of Virginia but they in 1774 they called</text>
  <text start="948.57" dur="4.71">a day of prayer and fasting on June 4</text>
  <text start="951.15" dur="3.99">1774 which incidentally is right around</text>
  <text start="953.28" dur="3.39">the season of Pentecost another Hebrew</text>
  <text start="955.14" dur="3.84">feast day but they called for this</text>
  <text start="956.67" dur="3.99">intense day of prayer and fasting and of</text>
  <text start="958.98" dur="3.24">course that eventually led to the</text>
  <text start="960.66" dur="5.52">outbreak of the American Revolution in</text>
  <text start="962.22" dur="6.03">early 1775 so some of them did really</text>
  <text start="966.18" dur="3.57">love yeah and and it talks about this in</text>
  <text start="968.25" dur="3.24">this book so I recommend that book I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="969.75" dur="4.32">put a link to it below the video it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="971.49" dur="4.62">great great book I know some people get</text>
  <text start="974.07" dur="3.21">wrapped up in the dark side they want to</text>
  <text start="976.11" dur="3.69">think about the Illuminati and the</text>
  <text start="977.28" dur="6.12">Freemasons and all that but there is</text>
  <text start="979.8" dur="5.7">also Yas and in this nation as well and</text>
  <text start="983.4" dur="4.77">and I like to focus on what yah was</text>
  <text start="985.5" dur="4.11">doing in bringing people together and he</text>
  <text start="988.17" dur="4.41">definitely was bringing people together</text>
  <text start="989.61" dur="4.68">I mean you know that&amp;#39;s very obvious in</text>
  <text start="992.58" dur="3.78">evidence I&amp;#39;m especially with Thomas</text>
  <text start="994.29" dur="4.22">Jefferson and Patrick Henry declaring</text>
  <text start="996.36" dur="4.62">this day of fasting in June 1st 1774</text>
  <text start="998.51" dur="5.17">specifically that laid the foundation</text>
  <text start="1000.98" dur="4.5">for the American Revolution also the</text>
  <text start="1003.68" dur="4.38">first straight awakening which occurred</text>
  <text start="1005.48" dur="5.04">in the 1730&amp;#39;s the 1740 sort of died out</text>
  <text start="1008.06" dur="4.47">in the 1750s this first great awakening</text>
  <text start="1010.52" dur="3.72">which had a preachers like George</text>
  <text start="1012.53" dur="4.17">Whitfield with his golden tongue and he</text>
  <text start="1014.24" dur="4.29">would amass thousands of people crowds</text>
  <text start="1016.7" dur="3.09">outside in the wintertime even when he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1018.53" dur="3.21">be preaching out throughout the American</text>

  <text start="1024.23" dur="3.99">these men of God who are mightily</text>
  <text start="1026.27" dur="3.6">anointed by the Holy Spirit it caused</text>
  <text start="1028.22" dur="3.42">the first great awakening that swept</text>
  <text start="1029.87" dur="5.73">through the American colonies at the</text>
  <text start="1031.64" dur="7.8">time in the in the 1740 to the 17 1732</text>
  <text start="1035.6" dur="5.13">the 1750s and that spiritual revival</text>
  <text start="1039.44" dur="4.879">that brought so many people to</text>
  <text start="1040.73" dur="6.02">repentance genuine repentance led</text>
  <text start="1044.319" dur="6.33">so to the American Revolution that broke</text>
  <text start="1046.75" dur="6.779">out in the 1770s and even though by the</text>
  <text start="1050.649" dur="5.91">1770s Christmas was no longer illegal</text>
  <text start="1053.529" dur="5.64">the Puritan and pilgrims from the early</text>
  <text start="1056.559" dur="4.681">1600s that culture was still so embedded</text>
  <text start="1059.169" dur="4.23">in the American colonies that by and</text>
  <text start="1061.24" dur="3.72">large most Americans living in the</text>
  <text start="1063.399" dur="2.341">thirty colonies were not celebrating</text>
  <text start="1064.96" dur="3.66">Christmas at all</text>
  <text start="1065.74" dur="4.35">now England was they were deeply</text>
  <text start="1068.62" dur="3">involved with that but they weren&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="1070.09" dur="4.069">that by the way that&amp;#39;s why George</text>
  <text start="1071.62" dur="6.059">Washington he won a decisive victory</text>
  <text start="1074.159" dur="5.02">where he literally ambushed the British</text>
  <text start="1077.679" dur="3.6">or the the allies of the British on</text>
  <text start="1079.179" dur="4.651">Christmas Eve because they were all</text>

  <text start="1083.83" dur="3.479">and celebrating their feast of</text>
  <text start="1085.149" dur="3.811">Saturnalia but George Washington his men</text>
  <text start="1087.309" dur="2.881">they didn&amp;#39;t even celebrate Christmas and</text>
  <text start="1088.96" dur="3.329">so they ambushed them and it actually</text>
  <text start="1090.19" dur="4.469">turned the tide of the war turn the tide</text>
