  <text start="0.11" dur="5.11">shabbat shalom this is daniel john lee</text>
  <text start="2.73" dur="6.72">with torah restoration ministries it is</text>
  <text start="5.22" dur="7.41">the Sabbath day june the 15 2013 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="9.45" dur="6.479">also the 49th omer this is hallelujah</text>
  <text start="12.63" dur="5.52">shavuot weekend Pentecost starts tonight</text>
  <text start="15.929" dur="5.281">at the end of the Sabbath day and goes</text>
  <text start="18.15" dur="6.75">through sunday night and foreshadowed</text>
  <text start="21.21" dur="5.579">I&amp;#39;m going to have two different messages</text>
  <text start="24.9" dur="4.529">that are going out I have a very</text>
  <text start="26.789" dur="5.31">important prophetic message that will be</text>
  <text start="29.429" dur="5.701">going out for shab load itself which</text>
  <text start="32.099" dur="5.581">again starts tonight but for today for</text>
  <text start="35.13" dur="5.37">the Sabbath day I have a another message</text>
  <text start="37.68" dur="6.09">and I was struggling how to present this</text>
  <text start="40.5" dur="5.16">because I have to sort of things that</text>
  <text start="43.77" dur="3.99">yah has placed upon my heart and at</text>
  <text start="45.66" dur="4.86">first they seemed kind of unrelated but</text>
  <text start="47.76" dur="5.97">as I&amp;#39;m looking at it now I&amp;#39;m seeing how</text>
  <text start="50.52" dur="6.179">they&amp;#39;re very very much related and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="53.73" dur="7.41">all about pursuing Yahshua it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="56.699" dur="6.991">about keeping your focus on him and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="61.14" dur="5.909">just going to go right into it here so</text>
  <text start="63.69" dur="5.429">this first part is called the lie of the</text>
  <text start="67.049" dur="6.541">New Age movement and the truth of</text>
  <text start="69.119" dur="7.081">surrender Joshua I recently saw a movie</text>
  <text start="73.59" dur="5.25">that I don&amp;#39;t want to name as I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="76.2" dur="4.59">recommend it yah yah has amazingly used</text>
  <text start="78.84" dur="3.95">this movie to remind me of something he</text>
  <text start="80.79" dur="3.93">has wanted me to write about</text>
  <text start="82.79" dur="4.119">paradoxically while this movie showed</text>
  <text start="84.72" dur="4.59">the selfish darkened twisting of the</text>
  <text start="86.909" dur="4.941">subject I used that to show me more</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="5.16">vividly the pure handling of the subject</text>
  <text start="91.85" dur="5.86">this is the idea that to pursue a joy</text>
  <text start="94.47" dur="5.969">for life actually brings joy it does not</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="4.53">to pursue enjoyment or happiness or</text>
  <text start="100.439" dur="3.811">really anything as the main goal of</text>
  <text start="102.24" dur="5.879">one&amp;#39;s life does not ever bring that</text>
  <text start="104.25" dur="6.27">which is sought for however when one</text>
  <text start="108.119" dur="5.07">decides delay is life down to Joshua of</text>
  <text start="110.52" dur="5.22">Nazareth and fit his life into the</text>
  <text start="113.189" dur="4.53">commandments of his work in other words</text>
  <text start="115.74" dur="5.07">when one chooses to make yah the top</text>
  <text start="117.719" dur="5.25">priority or the center of his life then</text>
  <text start="120.81" dur="5.58">true enjoyment of life true happiness</text>
  <text start="122.969" dur="6.391">results this is because yah who loves us</text>
  <text start="126.39" dur="5.099">very much is able to bring pleasures to</text>
  <text start="129.36" dur="3.72">us in the right context and thus</text>
  <text start="131.489" dur="4.261">enjoyment is truly</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="4.05">testing for example I went to go see</text>
  <text start="135.75" dur="3.33">this movie and it turned out to be a</text>
  <text start="137.13" dur="4.17">rather bad movie because one of its</text>
  <text start="139.08" dur="4.95">unspoken themes was that a person can</text>
  <text start="141.3" dur="6.33">enjoy life totally divorced from yah and</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="6.45">his word however because I do make yob a</text>
  <text start="147.63" dur="5.28">top priority in my life even by seeing</text>
  <text start="150.48" dur="4.2">what I would consider a bad movie y&amp;#39;all</text>
  <text start="152.91" dur="4.41">prompted me to write this article about</text>
  <text start="154.68" dur="4.44">what brings true happiness in other</text>
  <text start="157.32" dur="3.69">words because I didn&amp;#39;t just go see the</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="4.41">movie to see it rather it is in the</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="4.83">periphery or the background me loving</text>
  <text start="163.53" dur="3.9">yah with all my heart even what could</text>
  <text start="165.84" dur="4.91">have been a negative experience turned</text>
  <text start="167.43" dur="6.15">into one of great joy by glorifying him</text>
  <text start="170.75" dur="4.51">Yahshua made this point very clear when</text>
  <text start="173.58" dur="3.96">he said that the person who loses his</text>
  <text start="175.26" dur="5.1">life will find it one must totally</text>
  <text start="177.54" dur="5.04">abandon everything to yoshua trusting</text>
  <text start="180.36" dur="4.86">that he is good that his commandments</text>
  <text start="182.58" dur="6.39">are good and when one does so then true</text>
  <text start="185.22" dur="5.94">joy can begin now this does not mean</text>
  <text start="188.97" dur="4.83">everything is always rosy for the</text>
  <text start="191.16" dur="4.83">believer okay Joshua did say his yoke is</text>
  <text start="193.8" dur="4.35">light but he also said we must take up</text>
  <text start="195.99" dur="3.36">our cross Paul said we entered the</text>
  <text start="198.15" dur="4.23">kingdom of heaven through much</text>
  <text start="199.35" dur="5.1">tribulation but the point is when yah is</text>
  <text start="202.38" dur="4.29">at the center even the painful</text>
  <text start="204.45" dur="5.31">tribulations in our lives serve only to</text>
  <text start="206.67" dur="4.74">bring us closer to him after all all</text>
  <text start="209.76" dur="3.75">things work for the good to them who</text>
  <text start="211.41" dur="5.13">love him and are called according to his</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="4.92">purpose I would rather have the pains</text>
  <text start="216.54" dur="3.9">and rejections and hardships and</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="4.02">tribulations of following yah with</text>
  <text start="220.44" dur="4.32">everything in me while having that</text>
  <text start="222.45" dur="4.289">lasting and enduring joy only he can</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="4.14">impart but to try to pursue my own</text>
  <text start="226.739" dur="4.411">happiness and emissions while always</text>
  <text start="228.9" dur="5.76">feeling disconnected lost and plagued</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="6.119">with inner chaos giving our whole selves</text>
  <text start="234.66" dur="4.92">over to Yahshua is really the best thing</text>
  <text start="237.269" dur="4.891">we can do from the present moment and</text>
  <text start="239.58" dur="5.61">for every moment we experience from now</text>
  <text start="242.16" dur="5.97">throughout eternity it is the only way</text>
  <text start="245.19" dur="5.43">to truly enjoy life and this new-age</text>
  <text start="248.13" dur="5.07">concept that one can find inner peace or</text>
  <text start="250.62" dur="5.1">happiness or enjoyment without making</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="5.49">yah and it&amp;#39;s word the center is the</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="7.32">greatest liable for the very thing of</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="8.08">promises it never actually delivers</text>
  <text start="263.04" dur="6.31">so sort of contrasting the false New Age</text>
  <text start="266.77" dur="5.82">idea with you know what it truly means</text>
  <text start="269.35" dur="6.689">to serve Yahshua and I mean you know</text>
  <text start="272.59" dur="5.699">guys yah is the center of all reality so</text>
  <text start="276.039" dur="3.841">when you align yourself with his word</text>
  <text start="278.289" dur="4.861">and you align with yourself with his</text>
  <text start="279.88" dur="4.92">purposes then you know the lines were</text>
  <text start="283.15" dur="7.5">fallen to you in Pleasant places like</text>
  <text start="284.8" dur="8.459">what psalm 16 says it&amp;#39;s it brings you it</text>
  <text start="290.65" dur="5.16">brings you in alignment with him and and</text>
  <text start="293.259" dur="5.791">then you know a lot of there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="8.7">joy that comes with that in everyday</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="7.29">life Alleluia and and trying to do it</text>
  <text start="304.51" dur="4.56">without you I trying to do without his</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="4.5">word may bring temporary pleasure or</text>
  <text start="309.07" dur="6.98">temporary happiness but it won&amp;#39;t be last</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="9.329">if it will will eventually cave in now</text>
  <text start="316.05" dur="5.95">my next part of this video is sort of</text>
  <text start="320.169" dur="5.791">shown here in the picture and this is</text>
  <text start="322" dur="5.94">about Philippians and this is about well</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="4.05">I think you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll know it as I read</text>
  <text start="327.94" dur="4.56">it but it&amp;#39;s about you know again the</text>
  <text start="330.01" dur="6.24">pursuit of yah and I want to highlight</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="6.33">Philippians 3 13 through 14 or Paul</text>
  <text start="336.25" dur="4.729">writes brethren I count not myself to</text>
  <text start="338.83" dur="4.11">have apprehended but this one thing I do</text>
  <text start="340.979" dur="4.481">forgetting those things which are behind</text>
  <text start="342.94" dur="4.89">and reaching forth unto those things</text>
  <text start="345.46" dur="4.59">which are before I press toward the mark</text>
  <text start="347.83" dur="6.69">for the prize of the high calling of yah</text>
  <text start="350.05" dur="6.66">in Messiah Yahshua Paul is expressing</text>
  <text start="354.52" dur="4.709">from the deepest part of the soul his</text>
  <text start="356.71" dur="5.489">utter and desperate need is complete</text>
  <text start="359.229" dur="6.421">craving to know and grow closer and</text>
  <text start="362.199" dur="5.94">closer to Yahshua this push toward</text>
  <text start="365.65" dur="5.19">Yahshua must grow in intensity every</text>
  <text start="368.139" dur="6.81">moment and we must reach out pressing</text>
  <text start="370.84" dur="7.02">onward closer to God day by day oh how</text>
  <text start="374.949" dur="5.641">we need this now in the dark days that</text>
  <text start="377.86" dur="5.429">we are in we mean that deep and anguish</text>
  <text start="380.59" dur="5.49">like yearning to draw closer to you with</text>
  <text start="383.289" dur="5.551">every breath we take with every moment</text>
  <text start="386.08" dur="5.699">we live we dare not be content with our</text>
  <text start="388.84" dur="5.73">present relationship with yacht no we</text>
  <text start="391.779" dur="3.63">must know him more understand his word</text>
  <text start="394.57" dur="4.149">more perfect</text>
  <text start="395.409" dur="6.25">drinkin who he is into our lives more</text>
  <text start="398.719" dur="6.271">deeply we must strive to be closer to</text>
  <text start="401.659" dur="6.391">him tomorrow than we are today we must</text>
  <text start="404.99" dur="5.37">so it&amp;#39;s just as this deep yearning that</text>
  <text start="408.05" dur="5.579">Paul does so well expressing their in</text>
  <text start="410.36" dur="6.869">the book of Philippians and that really</text>
  <text start="413.629" dur="5.22">is the essence of the true life of a</text>
  <text start="417.229" dur="5.011">believer one who loves yasha was just</text>
  <text start="418.849" dur="5.581">wanting more and more and more to get</text>
  <text start="422.24" dur="5.85">closer to him to know him more to be</text>
  <text start="424.43" dur="5.37">able to glorify him better and and we do</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="3.81">that through reading his word we do that</text>
  <text start="429.8" dur="4.38">through constantly talking through to</text>
  <text start="431.9" dur="5.039">him throughout the day seeing him in our</text>
  <text start="434.18" dur="4.949">lives in every way by by fostering a</text>
  <text start="436.939" dur="5.7">close relationship with him and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="439.129" dur="7.201">that&amp;#39;s the center of reality for those</text>
  <text start="442.639" dur="5.671">who truly love ya and and it&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="446.33" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s important in these dark dark days</text>
  <text start="448.31" dur="4.8">that we&amp;#39;re living in so many people are</text>
  <text start="449.99" dur="7.109">looking at the fear that&amp;#39;s coming upon</text>
  <text start="453.11" dur="5.579">men that&amp;#39;s not where I should be our</text>
  <text start="457.099" dur="5.341">eyes need to be completely and totally</text>
  <text start="458.689" dur="5.94">on Yahshua HaMashiach so I hope you see</text>
  <text start="462.44" dur="4.14">how these sort of two messages connect</text>
  <text start="464.629" dur="4.801">it&amp;#39;s all about pursuing yacht with</text>
  <text start="466.58" dur="5.429">everything in us and and of course</text>
