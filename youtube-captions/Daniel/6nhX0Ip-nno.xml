  <text start="201.51" dur="3.87">I wanted to highlight this because this</text>
  <text start="203.01" dur="5.729">is the reason this is a landmark is</text>
  <text start="205.38" dur="5.37">because big pharma for many many decades</text>

  <text start="215.22" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s not the case anymore so I think</text>
  <text start="217.139" dur="4.47">this is a huge huge piece of good news</text>
  <text start="219.54" dur="4.5">of course I am totally opposed to Big</text>
  <text start="221.609" dur="6.181">Pharma in so many ways I&amp;#39;m convinced</text>
  <text start="224.04" dur="6.36">that big pharma driven by money all they</text>
  <text start="227.79" dur="4.86">try to do is pump people full with</text>

  <text start="232.65" dur="4.709">the root of the problem but just covers</text>
  <text start="235.5" dur="4.859">up the symptoms so I&amp;#39;m very very happy</text>

  <text start="746.489" dur="4.95">investigation was a sham Obama spied on</text>
  <text start="749.159" dur="3.84">the opposition party so a lot of the</text>
  <text start="751.439" dur="3.15">different elements of this story I have</text>
  <text start="752.999" dur="3.24">reported over the last several weeks but</text>
  <text start="754.589" dur="3.48">sometimes I know when we are covering</text>
  <text start="756.239" dur="3.72">all this stuff it can get kind of hard</text>
  <text start="758.069" dur="3.901">to remember all these different pieces</text>
