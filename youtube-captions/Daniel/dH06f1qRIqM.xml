  <text start="0" dur="7.859">now I wanted to talk about my personal</text>
  <text start="4.56" dur="8.52">plan that I have put forth on youtube in</text>
  <text start="7.859" dur="8.041">which I&amp;#39;m trying to raise money to to go</text>
  <text start="13.08" dur="5.279">to Minnesota I few weeks ago I put up a</text>
  <text start="15.9" dur="5.73">rampal to Crossroads a video which I</text>
  <text start="18.359" dur="5.01">said look I&amp;#39;m going to try to raise</text>
  <text start="21.63" dur="3.72">money so I can go to Minnesota like you</text>
  <text start="23.369" dur="3.9">all to help send money so that I can go</text>
  <text start="25.35" dur="3.57">to Minnesota and I&amp;#39;m going to try to get</text>
  <text start="27.269" dur="3.691">the permits I need to stand right in</text>
  <text start="28.92" dur="4.049">front of the republican national</text>
  <text start="30.96" dur="3.54">convention at the XL center and i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="32.969" dur="3.451">going to try to preach to delegates as</text>
  <text start="34.5" dur="3.48">they streaming to the convention hall to</text>
  <text start="36.42" dur="5.069">convince them to abstain from the first</text>
  <text start="37.98" dur="4.89">round of voting so they so that so that</text>
  <text start="41.489" dur="3.151">it can be turned into a brokered</text>
  <text start="42.87" dur="3.3">convention and so that ron paul can be</text>
  <text start="44.64" dur="3.329">nominated from the convention floor now</text>
  <text start="46.17" dur="4.74">I want to clear up some confusion</text>
  <text start="47.969" dur="4.381">because ron paul himself has said you</text>
  <text start="50.91" dur="3.6">know that he doesn&amp;#39;t have a chance of</text>
  <text start="52.35" dur="5.22">being nominated from the convention</text>
  <text start="54.51" dur="4.619">floor and he has said that he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="57.57" dur="2.669">have the enough delegates to win the</text>
  <text start="59.129" dur="3.66">nomination he has said all these things</text>
  <text start="60.239" dur="4.801">and i want to make something clear I I</text>
  <text start="62.789" dur="4.921">was a little confused when he ended his</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="5.369">campaign a few days ago because I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="5.58">sure if his delegates that are still</text>
  <text start="70.409" dur="5.701">going to the convention if they can</text>
  <text start="73.29" dur="4.41">still vote for Ron Paul and then the</text>
  <text start="76.11" dur="3.99">other question I had was if somehow</text>
  <text start="77.7" dur="4.8">McCain does not get enough delegates to</text>
  <text start="80.1" dur="4.05">vote for him in the first round and it</text>
  <text start="82.5" dur="3.15">is thus open to a second round of voting</text>
  <text start="84.15" dur="3.509">in which some of the delegates are that</text>
  <text start="85.65" dur="3.99">unbound free to go through they want and</text>
  <text start="87.659" dur="3.631">it turns into a brokered convention can</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="4.979">ron paul still be nominated from the</text>
  <text start="91.29" dur="5.7">convention floor well I asked the Ron</text>
  <text start="94.619" dur="4.32">Paul meetup group here in Portland which</text>
  <text start="96.99" dur="4.05">is really big they have a whole website</text>
  <text start="98.939" dur="4.5">or going into Ron Paul a lot of them are</text>
  <text start="101.04" dur="4.02">very knowledgeable and I got several</text>
  <text start="103.439" dur="4.651">answers and they all said yes to both</text>
  <text start="105.06" dur="4.98">questions that the delegates can still</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="3.66">vote for Ron Paul just like you know</text>
  <text start="110.04" dur="3.93">Huckabee&amp;#39;s delegates and Romney&amp;#39;s delts</text>
  <text start="111.75" dur="4.11">gets can still vote for Romney and</text>
  <text start="113.97" dur="3.499">Huckabee if they want the Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="115.86" dur="3.63">delegates can still vote for Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="117.469" dur="5.381">even though he suspended his campaign</text>
  <text start="119.49" dur="4.8">and furthermore if it did turn into a</text>
  <text start="122.85" dur="4.11">brokered convention which is what my</text>
  <text start="124.29" dur="4.829">goal is Ron Paul&amp;#39;s name could still be</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="4.47">nominated from the floor so when Ron</text>
  <text start="129.119" dur="3.411">Paul says he cannot be nominated from</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="3.47">the floor because of</text>
  <text start="132.53" dur="3.929">Elite elite wouldn&amp;#39;t allow that what</text>
  <text start="134.9" dur="4.02">he&amp;#39;s saying is he&amp;#39;s not saying that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.459" dur="4.741">not it&amp;#39;s not possible what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="138.92" dur="4.41">is it&amp;#39;s not likely and he&amp;#39;s right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.2" dur="3.78">not likely what is likely to happen is</text>
  <text start="143.33" dur="4.62">that there&amp;#39;s going to be one round of</text>
  <text start="144.98" dur="5.16">voting that McCain is going to get more</text>
  <text start="147.95" dur="3.6">than enough delegates to vote for him in</text>
  <text start="150.14" dur="3.09">the first round and he&amp;#39;ll become the</text>
  <text start="151.55" dur="3.87">presumptive he&amp;#39;ll become the nominee at</text>
  <text start="153.23" dur="3.9">that point that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s likely to</text>
  <text start="155.42" dur="3.24">happen that&amp;#39;s what rampal expects and</text>
  <text start="157.13" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s making other plans which</text>
  <text start="158.66" dur="5.37">is very practical okay he&amp;#39;s making other</text>
  <text start="160.85" dur="9.48">plans to advance his cause which is fine</text>
  <text start="164.03" dur="8.82">but it&amp;#39;s not necessarily so there is</text>
  <text start="170.33" dur="4.71">still a chance that if about twenty to</text>
  <text start="172.85" dur="3.57">twenty-five percent of the people that</text>
  <text start="175.04" dur="3.18">are bound to vote for McCain if they</text>
  <text start="176.42" dur="4.17">simply abstain which just means they</text>
  <text start="178.22" dur="6.269">don&amp;#39;t vote which is perfectly allowed by</text>
  <text start="180.59" dur="6.899">the GOP rules if they don&amp;#39;t vote which</text>
  <text start="184.489" dur="4.83">does not give McCain enough delegates to</text>
  <text start="187.489" dur="4.351">secure the nomination then there is a</text>
  <text start="189.319" dur="4.5">second round of voting in that second</text>
  <text start="191.84" dur="3.72">round a certain portion not all but a</text>
  <text start="193.819" dur="3.271">certain portion of Delegates that are</text>
  <text start="195.56" dur="3.48">bound to vote for a certain candidate</text>
  <text start="197.09" dur="6.27">are then free to vote for whomever they</text>
  <text start="199.04" dur="6.3">choose from the nomination floor anyone</text>
  <text start="203.36" dur="3.12">can be nominated I mean he doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="205.34" dur="3.27">have to be somebody who ran for</text>
  <text start="206.48" dur="4.38">president you could have Mayor Bloomberg</text>
  <text start="208.61" dur="4.89">nominated if you wanted you could really</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="5.43">basically have anyone that you can think</text>
  <text start="213.5" dur="6.54">of be nominated from the convention</text>
  <text start="216.29" dur="6.36">floor okay so the idea is is that you</text>
  <text start="220.04" dur="4.319">get past this first round McCain doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="222.65" dur="3.54">get enough delegates it sends shockwaves</text>
  <text start="224.359" dur="3.391">through the GOP establishment that</text>
  <text start="226.19" dur="3.78">McCain did not get enough delegates</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="3.72">which is very possible because a lot of</text>
  <text start="229.97" dur="3.989">the people bound to vote for McCain</text>
  <text start="231.47" dur="5.79">don&amp;#39;t necessarily like McCain okay any</text>
  <text start="233.959" dur="6.03">more than they like Obama or Hillary so</text>
  <text start="237.26" dur="4.62">um so it sends these shop is and then</text>
  <text start="239.989" dur="3.81">you have some realm Ron Paul delegates</text>
  <text start="241.88" dur="4.109">that I don&amp;#39;t know exactly how the</text>
  <text start="243.799" dur="4.53">process works but they put forth Ron</text>
  <text start="245.989" dur="3.481">Paul&amp;#39;s name maybe someone seconds it i</text>
  <text start="248.329" dur="3.061">don&amp;#39;t know but anyway he&amp;#39;s nominated</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="3.12">from the floor and I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="251.39" dur="2.64">others there might be how come you</text>
  <text start="252.59" dur="3.149">delegates and romney delegates others</text>
  <text start="254.03" dur="3.15">who will put forth their candidate say</text>
  <text start="255.739" dur="3.631">hey wait a minute since became didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="257.18" dur="3.69">win maybe we can win and so then the</text>
  <text start="259.37" dur="2.82">idea is in the second round hopefully</text>
  <text start="260.87" dur="3.33">you can get more delegates to vote for</text>
  <text start="262.19" dur="3.76">Ron Paul and then if it has to go to a</text>
  <text start="264.2" dur="4.3">third round you get even more until</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="4.56">you have enough rounds where Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="268.5" dur="5.55">has enough delegates to win the</text>
  <text start="270.51" dur="6">presidency our win the nomination so my</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="6.6">goal is still to go to Minnesota in</text>
  <text start="276.51" dur="6.6">September to try to get as close as I</text>
  <text start="280.65" dur="5.16">can to the excel centre and preach lift</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="4.05">up my voice and try to convince the</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="4.23">delegates that are streaming into the</text>
  <text start="287.16" dur="4.92">convention center to abstain from the</text>
  <text start="290.04" dur="3.48">first round of voting so that Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="292.08" dur="5.88">can be nominated from the convention</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="9.36">floor is it is it likely no it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="297.96" dur="6.36">likely I i if i go and i do this what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.88" dur="3.36">very likely to happen is mccain</text>
  <text start="304.32" dur="3.51">supporters and delegates will see me and</text>
  <text start="306.24" dur="5.01">shrug their shoulders and go in and do</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="6.87">what they want but is it possible it is</text>
  <text start="311.25" dur="5.55">possible if i don&amp;#39;t do it then the</text>
  <text start="314.7" dur="6.18">mccain people are definitely going to</text>
  <text start="316.8" dur="7.14">vote for mccain if I do do it there is a</text>
  <text start="320.88" dur="5.55">possibility that something I say might</text>
  <text start="323.94" dur="4.29">stick in their minds and they simply say</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="3.63">well you know maybe I will abstain</text>
  <text start="328.23" dur="4.08">because I just want to see what happens</text>
  <text start="330.06" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;m not voting against mccain i&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="332.31" dur="3.75">going to abstain because I hear what</text>
  <text start="334.08" dur="3.78">this guy saying I&amp;#39;ve seen all these Ron</text>
  <text start="336.06" dur="4.08">Paul signs I see all these rampal blooms</text>
  <text start="337.86" dur="4.11">in the air so maybe I&amp;#39;ll just I want to</text>
  <text start="340.14" dur="3.69">see who the strong Paul guy is and maybe</text>
  <text start="341.97" dur="3.48">I should consider him so I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="343.83" dur="3.48">to vote against mccain but i&amp;#39;ll abstain</text>
  <text start="345.45" dur="3.48">just to see what happens if i can get</text>
  <text start="347.31" dur="3.99">even twenty to twenty-five percent of</text>
  <text start="348.93" dur="4.32">those delegates to do that then we have</text>
  <text start="351.3" dur="3.81">a than we have a brokered convention so</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="3.54">that is still possible so i wanted to</text>
  <text start="355.11" dur="3.84">make that clear because i know there was</text>
  <text start="356.79" dur="4.68">a lot of mass confusion that went around</text>
  <text start="358.95" dur="4.53">everywhere people saying well do you</text>
  <text start="361.47" dur="4.95">know if ron paul&amp;#39;s dropped out of the</text>
  <text start="363.48" dur="5.1">race who how can his delegates you know</text>
  <text start="366.42" dur="4.5">vote and and ron paul himself has even</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="4.29">said in his speech where he effectively</text>
  <text start="370.92" dur="3.78">ended the campaign he encouraged his</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="3.3">delegates to go to the convention to be</text>
  <text start="374.7" dur="2.85">a part of the convention well he</text>
  <text start="376.17" dur="4.5">wouldn&amp;#39;t do that if the delegates</text>
  <text start="377.55" dur="4.62">couldn&amp;#39;t vote for Ron Paul okay so Rob</text>
  <text start="380.67" dur="3.75">Hall himself knows that elegance can</text>
  <text start="382.17" dur="3.9">still vote for Ron Paul they can still</text>
  <text start="384.42" dur="3.72">affect the platform they can still do</text>
  <text start="386.07" dur="3.6">things so Ron Paul does want our</text>
  <text start="388.14" dur="4.92">presence to be there at the National</text>
  <text start="389.67" dur="5.51">Republican convention so I just wanted</text>
  <text start="393.06" dur="4.05">to make that clear for anyone who has</text>
  <text start="395.18" dur="3.709">contacted me and said that they wanted</text>
  <text start="397.11" dur="3.339">to support me or any</text>
  <text start="398.889" dur="4.411">you might have seen my videos and was</text>
  <text start="400.449" dur="5.25">thinking about supporting me please send</text>
  <text start="403.3" dur="4.56">your money to me support me so that I</text>
  <text start="405.699" dur="4.74">can go to Minnesota and do this I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="407.86" dur="3.959">public speaker I have no fear of</text>
  <text start="410.439" dur="3.81">speaking in front of crowds I do this</text>
  <text start="411.819" dur="3.84">all the time on college campuses I speak</text>
  <text start="414.249" dur="2.94">in front of people a lot I&amp;#39;ve dealt with</text>
  <text start="415.659" dur="2.82">the police I know how to deal with them</text>
  <text start="417.189" dur="3.06">I know how to get permits I know how to</text>
  <text start="418.479" dur="3.571">work the system so that i can get where</text>
  <text start="420.249" dur="5.491">I need to get to reach these people so</text>
  <text start="422.05" dur="5.459">if don&amp;#39;t let all this confuse you okay</text>
  <text start="425.74" dur="3.899">it&amp;#39;s still possible to get Ron Paul to</text>
  <text start="427.509" dur="4.951">be nominated the president of the united</text>
  <text start="429.639" dur="6.18">states that could still happen and what</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="5.31">the way it would play out is I&amp;#39;d go</text>
  <text start="435.819" dur="3.6">there I&amp;#39;d preach I try to convince and</text>
  <text start="437.77" dur="3.56">talk to as many delegates as possible</text>
  <text start="439.419" dur="5.641">that are set to bound for McCain to to</text>
  <text start="441.33" dur="6.1">abstain then what would happen is the</text>
  <text start="445.06" dur="3.719">first round comes and goes and McCain</text>
  <text start="447.43" dur="2.63">doesn&amp;#39;t get enough delegates it&amp;#39;s all of</text>
  <text start="448.779" dur="3.36">a sudden open to a brokered convention</text>
  <text start="450.06" dur="4.3">there&amp;#39;s a great deal of excitement and</text>
  <text start="452.139" dur="4.59">fervor and then across the river Ron</text>
  <text start="454.36" dur="5.04">Paul and his people hear the news it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.729" dur="5.46">blasted across the news media and all of</text>
  <text start="459.4" dur="5.129">a sudden Ron Paul might use his bully</text>
  <text start="462.189" dur="3.6">pulpit from where he&amp;#39;s speaking and say</text>
  <text start="464.529" dur="4.38">hey look there&amp;#39;s a brokered convention</text>
  <text start="465.789" dur="4.891">now you know and he can just start</text>
  <text start="468.909" dur="3.75">speaking and and i&amp;#39;m sure would be</text>
  <text start="470.68" dur="3.419">televised and you would really have an</text>
  <text start="472.659" dur="3.901">amazing thing and then and then you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="474.099" dur="3.69">have the next round of voting if you got</text>
  <text start="476.56" dur="2.729">enough rounds where ron paul was</text>
  <text start="477.789" dur="6.81">nominated then ron paul could literally</text>
  <text start="479.289" dur="7.53">go from his his rally travel across the</text>
  <text start="484.599" dur="5.271">river and a huge convoy parade whatever</text>
  <text start="486.819" dur="5.491">and walk into the convention to give his</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="5.169">acceptance speech as the nominee I mean</text>
  <text start="492.31" dur="4.079">wouldn&amp;#39;t that be cool it could happen I</text>
  <text start="495.039" dur="4.56">think we&amp;#39;re talking about a world in</text>
  <text start="496.389" dur="7.71">which we had you know the election of</text>
  <text start="499.599" dur="8.04">2000 ok and all the drama September 11</text>
  <text start="504.099" dur="5.13">2001 okay Hurricane Katrina I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="507.639" dur="3.39">talking about a world in which a lot of</text>
  <text start="509.229" dur="5.131">crazy things have been happening these</text>
  <text start="511.029" dur="5.19">last eight years so really the events i</text>
  <text start="514.36" dur="3.599">just described would sort of fit in with</text>
  <text start="516.219" dur="4.95">the world we&amp;#39;re living in I mean you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="517.959" dur="5.76">be crazy in a good way well bad way for</text>
  <text start="521.169" dur="4.651">the Democrats and a bad way for the</text>
  <text start="523.719" dur="4.081">neo-cons but it&amp;#39;d be good for us be good</text>
  <text start="525.82" dur="3.6">for the people and of course then Ron</text>
  <text start="527.8" dur="3.479">Paul would have a field day for the next</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="3.78">few months the next month two months</text>
  <text start="531.279" dur="6.631">totally squashing Obama</text>
  <text start="533.2" dur="6.15">in the debates so anyway I encourage you</text>
