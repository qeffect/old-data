  <text start="201.61" dur="4.14">underground nests bases in California</text>
  <text start="203.8" dur="3.659">and the reason why California getting</text>
  <text start="205.75" dur="5.22">sprayed now is because it&amp;#39;s come out of</text>
  <text start="207.459" dur="5.101">Northern Nevada as it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re upset</text>

  <text start="212.56" dur="5.79">never retaliated spraying the skies</text>
  <text start="214.78" dur="4.83">because of all those dumbs deep</text>
  <text start="218.35" dur="3.15">underground military bases that were</text>

  <text start="221.5" dur="3.959">past weekend last week when you know all</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="3.75">those electrical outages happened all</text>
  <text start="225.459" dur="4.53">the stuff happened it&amp;#39;s because since</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="4.47">July and it sort of culminated last week</text>
  <text start="229.989" dur="3.72">but since July they have been actively</text>
  <text start="232.09" dur="3.89">involved in rescuing children and</text>
  <text start="233.709" dur="4.831">destroying these underground bases</text>
  <text start="235.98" dur="4.42">netting in a rescue over 10,000 children</text>
  <text start="238.54" dur="3.21">which if you want to know more about</text>

  <text start="254.77" dur="2.939">have knocked out all their bases in</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="3.089">California but</text>

  <text start="259.239" dur="5.43">because of those bases in Northern</text>
  <text start="260.609" dur="6.011">Nevada so they&amp;#39;re still working on it</text>
  <text start="264.669" dur="3.961">the Patriots and white hats are still</text>
  <text start="266.62" dur="4.74">working on it because it&amp;#39;s a war but we</text>
