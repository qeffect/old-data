  <text start="54.6" dur="3.87">the Christians call the New Testament</text>
  <text start="56.329" dur="5.471">the renewed covenant is simply the</text>
  <text start="58.47" dur="6.89">english translation of brit hadashah the</text>
  <text start="61.8" dur="9.48">renewed covenant so John chapter 14</text>
  <text start="65.36" dur="9.399">verses 21 and 23 I&amp;#39;ll just read all of</text>
  <text start="71.28" dur="5.13">all three from 21 22 and 23 says Yahshua</text>
  <text start="74.759" dur="3.691">speaking the Masai he says he that has</text>
  <text start="76.41" dur="4.709">my Commandments and keeps them he it is</text>

  <text start="83.28" dur="5.31">him and will manifest myself to him and</text>
  <text start="86.7" dur="4.05">then judas said unto him not Judas</text>
  <text start="88.59" dur="4.889">Iscariot but the other Judas who is a</text>
  <text start="90.75" dur="4.71">disciple he said Lord how is it that you</text>
  <text start="93.479" dur="4.621">will manifest yourself unto us and not</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="4.62">under the world and Yahshua answered and</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="4.26">said unto them if a man loved me he will</text>
  <text start="100.08" dur="4.44">keep my words and my father will love</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="6.45">him that will come unto him and make our</text>
  <text start="104.52" dur="7.11">abode with him ok so this is John 14 21</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="5.789">through 23 so when Yahshua says he that</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="5.37">has my Commandments Yahshua is standing</text>

  <text start="253.03" dur="7.079">it the Old Testament you know the books</text>
  <text start="255.25" dur="6.45">from Genesis 22 to Malachi although the</text>
  <text start="260.109" dur="3.331">Christians call the Old Testament its</text>
  <text start="261.7" dur="4.7">josh are called it the Torah and the</text>
  <text start="263.44" dur="5.52">prophets the tour and the prophets and</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="5.23">you know there was a man named marcy on</text>
  <text start="268.96" dur="5.76">he lived in the second century AD he was</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="4.74">a heretic he hated the Jews but he was a</text>
  <text start="274.72" dur="3.96">heretic and most of the believers</text>
  <text start="276.37" dur="3.87">rejected him as a heretic but Marcy on</text>
  <text start="278.68" dur="4.77">was one who invented the term Old</text>
  <text start="280.24" dur="4.83">Testament and New Testament before that</text>
  <text start="283.45" dur="3.15">time before the second century when</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="4.44">Marcie on used that phrase and was</text>
  <text start="286.6" dur="4.23">rejected as a heretic it was referred to</text>
  <text start="289.51" dur="4.11">as the tour of the prophets and the</text>
  <text start="290.83" dur="5.22">renewed covenant because the Scriptures</text>
  <text start="293.62" dur="3.75">the Bible it&amp;#39;s not like you have old and</text>
  <text start="296.05" dur="3.06">new it&amp;#39;s not like you because you get</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="3.93">this image like somehow the new is</text>
  <text start="299.11" dur="4.86">opposed to the old or vice versa it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="301.3" dur="4.149">more a seamless whole and so you got the</text>
  <text start="303.97" dur="4.419">throne the prophets and then</text>
  <text start="305.449" dur="5.31">these torrent profits are renewed so</text>
  <text start="308.389" dur="3.9">yeah that&amp;#39;s the only thing he could</text>
  <text start="310.759" dur="3.571">possibly be referring to is the Torah</text>
  <text start="312.289" dur="3.72">and the prophets when he says he that</text>
  <text start="314.33" dur="3.63">has my Commandments and keeps them he it</text>
  <text start="316.009" dur="4.351">as it loves me so what are the</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="3.929">commandments well we know this because</text>
  <text start="320.36" dur="3.75">Yahshua actually taught them because if</text>
  <text start="321.889" dur="4.441">you go to verse 23 he says he that keeps</text>
  <text start="324.11" dur="4.139">my words okay well what were yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.33" dur="3.57">words we can go to the Gospels to find</text>
  <text start="328.249" dur="3.271">it was awarded for well people asked him</text>
  <text start="329.9" dur="4.53">how do we get a turn of life he says</text>
  <text start="331.52" dur="4.829">keep the commandments obey your father</text>
  <text start="334.43" dur="3.539">honor your father and mother you know</text>
  <text start="336.349" dur="2.49">love yo if I your heart soul mind and</text>
  <text start="337.969" dur="3.63">strength love your neighbor as yourself</text>
  <text start="338.839" dur="7.491">ee leadless the commandments when people</text>
  <text start="341.599" dur="8.88">ask them so he&amp;#39;s reaffirming the Torah</text>
  <text start="346.33" dur="5.799">the commandments now in the first</text>
  <text start="350.479" dur="3.3">century when he said this when he said</text>
  <text start="352.129" dur="3.87">keep my Commandments was there a</text>
  <text start="353.779" dur="8.491">division between the moral ceremonial</text>
  <text start="355.999" dur="8.521">and civil laws no no these Jewish people</text>
  <text start="362.27" dur="3.629">they kept the the moral laws what</text>
  <text start="364.52" dur="2.789">Christians call demoralised ouch not</text>
  <text start="365.899" dur="3.931">commit adultery thou shalt not steal</text>
  <text start="367.309" dur="4.801">they also were busy to eat and a clean</text>
  <text start="369.83" dur="5.19">foods and they did animal sacrifices at</text>
  <text start="372.11" dur="5.489">the temple they to the Jewish mind there</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="6">wasn&amp;#39;t moral civil and ceremonial it was</text>
  <text start="377.599" dur="6.78">all one thing is a six hundred some-odd</text>
  <text start="381.02" dur="5.489">laws that God had given on to Moses on</text>
  <text start="384.379" dur="5.22">Mount Sinai and they didn&amp;#39;t they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="386.509" dur="5.58">make this stupid separation of civil</text>
  <text start="389.599" dur="4.05">Surma no so when again when Jesus says</text>
  <text start="392.089" dur="4.14">keep my Commandments he&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="393.649" dur="5.281">saying keep the Ten Commandments or keep</text>
  <text start="396.229" dur="4.77">just you know these two now he says keep</text>
  <text start="398.93" dur="5.19">my Commandments that&amp;#39;s all the 600 laws</text>
  <text start="400.999" dur="4.861">that are in Torah now of course the</text>
  <text start="404.12" dur="4.319">problem is I quote was seeing Galatians</text>
  <text start="405.86" dur="4.41">the problem was is that the the many of</text>
  <text start="408.439" dur="3.81">the Jewish leaders had forgotten what</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="4.319">love was and so they had added in a lot</text>
  <text start="412.249" dur="3.84">of their own man-made traditions and</text>
  <text start="414.589" dur="4.14">mixed it in with the Torah and so Jesus</text>
  <text start="416.089" dur="4.44">had to bust those things down now that</text>
  <text start="418.729" dur="3.66">was another problem but when Yahshua</text>
  <text start="420.529" dur="5.42">says keep my Commandments he&amp;#39;s referring</text>
  <text start="422.389" dur="3.56">to the Torah given to Moses</text>
  <text start="427.91" dur="6.31">because the Torah was was given who gave</text>
  <text start="431.97" dur="4.53">the Torah to Moses who gave the tour to</text>
  <text start="434.22" dur="4.229">Moses who who was it that was on Mount</text>
  <text start="436.5" dur="5.61">Sinai that appeared in the chicana glory</text>
  <text start="438.449" dur="8.581">who who was that Yahweh Yahweh and who</text>
  <text start="442.11" dur="8.309">is Yahweh our Creator God give most and</text>
  <text start="447.03" dur="5.58">and and who is that that is the Yahweh</text>
  <text start="450.419" dur="5.691">the one that was on the mountaintop</text>
  <text start="452.61" dur="6">guess what that was Joshua of Nazareth</text>
  <text start="456.11" dur="3.94">that was Yash from Nazareth Joshua of</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="4.049">Nazareth the man that was born in</text>
  <text start="460.05" dur="4.589">Bethlehem he was the one who appeared on</text>
  <text start="462.659" dur="4.98">Mount Sinai he was the one in the</text>
  <text start="464.639" dur="4.71">burning bush this same Yahshua this</text>
  <text start="467.639" dur="4.65">carpenter who is now manifested in the</text>
  <text start="469.349" dur="5.181">flesh he was the same one who was on</text>
  <text start="472.289" dur="5.28">Mount Sinai giving the law to Moses and</text>
  <text start="474.53" dur="5.109">yet Christians want to somehow say that</text>
  <text start="477.569" dur="4.38">Jesus came along was a schizophrenic and</text>
  <text start="479.639" dur="4.62">said oh yeah I&amp;#39;m gonna gonna totally no</text>
  <text start="481.949" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s that that makes the Bible</text>
  <text start="484.259" dur="3.991">completely contradictory Jesus of</text>
  <text start="486.419" dur="4.231">Nazareth appeared on Mount Sinai and</text>
  <text start="488.25" dur="4.889">gave all these precious laws to Moses</text>
  <text start="490.65" dur="5.22">and Jesus of Nazareth was born in</text>
  <text start="493.139" dur="6.421">Miriam&amp;#39;s womb a couple thousand years</text>
  <text start="495.87" dur="5.37">later as a man and he had given up that</text>
  <text start="499.56" dur="3.93">chicana glory had given up that</text>
  <text start="501.24" dur="7.049">authority he&amp;#39;d given up all that and</text>
  <text start="503.49" dur="6.149">became a lowly humble man but he was the</text>
  <text start="508.289" dur="3.69">same one who was on Mount Sinai</text>
  <text start="509.639" dur="4.26">thousands of years before this is why he</text>
  <text start="511.979" dur="7.86">said when the Pharisee said who are you</text>
  <text start="513.899" dur="9.361">he said before Abraham was I am now he</text>
  <text start="519.839" dur="5.011">wasn&amp;#39;t a lunatic he wasn&amp;#39;t crazy he was</text>
  <text start="523.26" dur="2.579">the one human being that has walked on</text>
  <text start="524.85" dur="4.34">this earth that has never had a</text>
  <text start="525.839" dur="5.551">beginning and he&amp;#39;ll never have an end</text>
  <text start="529.19" dur="5.44">he&amp;#39;s the only human being that will ever</text>
  <text start="531.39" dur="7.16">have that quality all of us have had</text>

  <text start="1067.7" dur="5.55">am saying is is that the the general</text>
