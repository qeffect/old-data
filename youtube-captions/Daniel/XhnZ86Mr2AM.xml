  <text start="38.91" dur="4.2">also good to watch before you watch this</text>
  <text start="40.52" dur="5.609">so I wanted to do we know that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="43.11" dur="7.08">seven assemblies in Revelation 2 and 3</text>
  <text start="46.129" dur="6.461">we have emphasis we have Smyrna we have</text>
  <text start="50.19" dur="5.34">Pergamos Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia</text>
  <text start="52.59" dur="4.649">and Laodicea and these seven</text>
  <text start="55.53" dur="4.2">congregations were not just literal</text>
  <text start="57.239" dur="5.281">seven assemblies in Asia Minor but which</text>
  <text start="59.73" dur="5.34">they were that yoga Don John the Apostle</text>
  <text start="62.52" dur="5.52">sent letters to prompted by the Holy</text>
  <text start="65.07" dur="4.799">Spirit but but these also are seven</text>
  <text start="68.04" dur="4.5">descriptions of the seven type of</text>
  <text start="69.869" dur="4.441">believers across the earth so every</text>
  <text start="72.54" dur="3.75">single believer every person who has</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="3.96">placed their faith in Yahshua they are</text>
  <text start="76.29" dur="5.07">part of one of these seven assemblies</text>
  <text start="78.27" dur="5.19">and of course I&amp;#39;ve taught on a number of</text>
  <text start="81.36" dur="3.799">videos now but the Assembly you really</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="4.44">want to be a part of is Philadelphia</text>
  <text start="85.159" dur="5.14">because Philadelphia you know you can</text>
  <text start="87.9" dur="4.17">grab a hold of those promises which is</text>
  <text start="90.299" dur="4.471">the key of David which means having hard</text>
  <text start="92.07" dur="4.89">after yaws own which is learning the</text>
  <text start="94.77" dur="3.419">word of his patience which when you ask</text>
  <text start="96.96" dur="3.119">God to teach you that you have to go</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="4.201">through a lot of sort of trials and</text>
  <text start="100.079" dur="3.961">learning the word of his patience to to</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="3.15">be qualified to be grafted into</text>
  <text start="104.04" dur="2.67">Philadelphia there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="105.54" dur="4.77">characteristics you can read about and</text>
  <text start="106.71" dur="5.4">every single assembly has these certain</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="4.28">characteristics and you can grab a hold</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="6.329">of that promise in Philadelphia because</text>
  <text start="114.59" dur="5.319">Yahshua said in Luke 21 pray that you</text>
  <text start="118.439" dur="2.611">are kind of ready to escape all these</text>
  <text start="119.909" dur="3.991">things at the standard for the</text>
  <text start="121.05" dur="5.55">man and we read that Philadelphia is the</text>
  <text start="123.9" dur="5.25">one congregation that is allowed to</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="4.05">escape the out of temptation and no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.15" dur="3.93">not through a pre-tribulation rapture</text>
  <text start="130.65" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a hoax it&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="3.93">through revelation 12 being allowed to</text>
  <text start="134.82" dur="3.66">be part of that woman that flees into</text>
  <text start="137.01" dur="3.63">the wilderness during the three and a</text>
  <text start="138.48" dur="5.1">half year reign of terror of the son of</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="4.77">perdition and this is why Paul says in</text>
  <text start="143.58" dur="2.88">1st Thessalonians 4 that the dead and</text>
  <text start="145.41" dur="2.58">Messiah will rise first</text>
  <text start="146.46" dur="3.51">and then those who are alive and remain</text>
  <text start="147.99" dur="4.08">will be caught up with him so there is a</text>
  <text start="149.97" dur="4.89">resurrection we do get caught up to meet</text>
  <text start="152.07" dur="5.13">Jesus in the clouds but it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="154.86" dur="4.68">happen before it happens right toward</text>
  <text start="157.2" dur="4.71">the end of the Great Tribulation at the</text>
  <text start="159.54" dur="3.96">seventh trumpet and the way you can be</text>
  <text start="161.91" dur="3.24">one of those people who are alive and</text>
  <text start="163.5" dur="4.29">remain at the end and not get murdered</text>
  <text start="165.15" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s by grabbing ahold of that promise</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="4.56">in Philadelphia however I wanted to</text>
  <text start="170.7" dur="3.09">point out that there is another assembly</text>
  <text start="172.35" dur="3.6">amongst the seven that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="173.79" dur="4.8">receive any rebukes in fact they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="175.95" dur="4.53">encouraged and that&amp;#39;s Smyrna and Smyrna</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="5.46">how the martyrs and I want to answer the</text>
  <text start="180.48" dur="4.83">question well how come there&amp;#39;s people</text>
  <text start="184.05" dur="2.82">that are part of Philadelphia and then</text>
  <text start="185.31" dur="3.899">there&amp;#39;s people who part of Smyrna</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="3.81">they both are innocent both of those</text>
  <text start="189.209" dur="3.631">congregations are the only two that</text>
  <text start="190.68" dur="4.41">never got any rebukes what determines</text>
  <text start="192.84" dur="4.8">who&amp;#39;s a part of Smyrna and who&amp;#39;s a part</text>
  <text start="195.09" dur="3.93">of Philadelphia well I&amp;#39;m glad you asked</text>
  <text start="197.64" dur="8.31">that&amp;#39;s what this teachings going to be</text>
  <text start="199.02" dur="8.91">all about so we got Smyrna and you could</text>
  <text start="205.95" dur="8.72">read about Samara where they are the</text>
  <text start="207.93" dur="6.74">martyrs and then we got Philadelphia</text>
  <text start="215.06" dur="5.98">which literally means the city of</text>
  <text start="217.26" dur="7.37">brotherly love and they are the ones who</text>
  <text start="221.04" dur="3.59">escape the hour of temptation</text>
  <text start="226.31" dur="4.2">right now where we are and again you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="229.22" dur="4.2">not going to understand this unless you</text>
  <text start="230.51" dur="5.66">watched my previous video promising</text>
  <text start="233.42" dur="5.28">pedophiles Trump x marks the spot that I</text>
  <text start="236.17" dur="9.85">basically postulated my theory about how</text>
  <text start="238.7" dur="8.82">we have that total solar eclipse in 2017</text>
  <text start="246.02" dur="3.81">which was part of that Jubilee year that</text>
  <text start="247.52" dur="4.469">I talked about in that video and then</text>
  <text start="249.83" dur="9.57">about seven years later you have another</text>
  <text start="251.989" dur="8.911">total solar eclipse in 2024 during the</text>
  <text start="259.4" dur="3.3">Hebrew feast days it&amp;#39;s actually right</text>
  <text start="260.9" dur="3.96">before the Hebrew new year that year and</text>
  <text start="262.7" dur="4.86">so it&amp;#39;s about it&amp;#39;s approximately a seven</text>
  <text start="264.86" dur="4.65">year period and that this period is</text>
  <text start="267.56" dur="4.77">basically the final seven years for</text>
  <text start="269.51" dur="5.49">America to get her Affairs in order</text>
  <text start="272.33" dur="4.74">you know Trump under Trump we&amp;#39;re allowed</text>
  <text start="275" dur="4.59">this refree where we can reach souls and</text>
  <text start="277.07" dur="4.53">we can we&amp;#39;re gonna be very blessed and</text>
  <text start="279.59" dur="4.44">things are going to be incredible but as</text>
  <text start="281.6" dur="5.16">the old cabal is getting taken down that</text>
  <text start="284.03" dur="4.44">jesuit vatican old cabal and everyone</text>
  <text start="286.76" dur="3.54">connected with it like the clinton cabal</text>
  <text start="288.47" dur="2.97">but bush cabal is as they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="290.3" dur="3.21">taken down and we have just this</text>
  <text start="291.44" dur="4.56">explosion of technology and just</text>
  <text start="293.51" dur="5.82">blessing and prosperity by the time we</text>
  <text start="296" dur="5.37">get here in 2024 then we have a three</text>
  <text start="299.33" dur="4.53">and a half year tribulation until 2027</text>
  <text start="301.37" dur="4.65">the fall 2027 this is where the son of</text>
  <text start="303.86" dur="5.91">perdition reigns after but right before</text>
  <text start="306.02" dur="7.35">the end of trump&amp;#39;s second term and what</text>
  <text start="309.77" dur="5.34">happens is this mmm right now as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.37" dur="3.77">speaking and as we continue to go for on</text>
  <text start="315.11" dur="4.98">this timeline Smyrna and Philadelphia</text>
  <text start="317.14" dur="7.3">they&amp;#39;re all one one group of people</text>
  <text start="320.09" dur="10.49">right now and let me show you that if</text>
  <text start="324.44" dur="6.14">you go to Daniel chapter 11 it says</text>
  <text start="333.46" dur="5.2">starting in verse 32 and such as do</text>
  <text start="337.039" dur="3.931">wickedly against the covenant shall he</text>
  <text start="338.66" dur="4.2">corrupt by flatteries but the people</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="5.1">that do know their yah shall be strong</text>
  <text start="342.86" dur="5.67">and do exploits and they that understand</text>
  <text start="346.07" dur="4.469">among the people shall instruct many yet</text>
  <text start="348.53" dur="5.07">they shall fall by the sword and by</text>
  <text start="350.539" dur="5.521">flame by captivity and by spoil many</text>
  <text start="353.6" dur="4.86">days now when they shall fall they shall</text>
  <text start="356.06" dur="3.64">be hoping with a little help but many</text>
  <text start="358.46" dur="3.55">shall plead to them a flat</text>
  <text start="359.7" dur="4.53">and some of them of understanding shall</text>
  <text start="362.01" dur="3.93">fall to try them and to purge and to</text>
  <text start="364.23" dur="5.69">make them white even to the time of the</text>
  <text start="365.94" dur="7.56">end but it is yet for a time appointed</text>
  <text start="369.92" dur="5.56">so it&amp;#39;s the time of the end and yet it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="3.84">still not the time of the end it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="375.48" dur="4.59">yet for a time appointed so we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="377.34" dur="5.19">time of the end but that time appointed</text>
  <text start="380.07" dur="4.11">of the actual end is not fully until</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="3.96">about three and a half year a</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="3.6">tribulation so we have both Philadelphia</text>
  <text start="386.49" dur="3.03">and Smyrna these believers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="387.78" dur="4.8">teaching people they&amp;#39;re instructing</text>
  <text start="389.52" dur="4.71">people they&amp;#39;re guiding people but as we</text>
  <text start="392.58" dur="4.47">get closer and closer toward this time</text>
  <text start="394.23" dur="5.13">there&amp;#39;s going to be a split where</text>
  <text start="397.05" dur="3.63">certain believers are going to have</text>
  <text start="399.36" dur="3.56">people cleaving to them with flatteries</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="4.62">trying to flatter them with lips and</text>
  <text start="402.92" dur="5.74">they&amp;#39;re going to basically be martyrs</text>
  <text start="405.3" dur="7.49">leading the other congregations which</text>
  <text start="408.66" dur="7.53">would be Ephesus Pergamos Thyatira</text>
  <text start="412.79" dur="6.34">Sardis and Laodicea those believers who</text>
  <text start="416.19" dur="4.44">didn&amp;#39;t make it to the wilderness because</text>
  <text start="419.13" dur="3.72">they they didn&amp;#39;t get their lives right</text>
  <text start="420.63" dur="4.17">they were live in lukewarm lives they</text>
  <text start="422.85" dur="4.32">didn&amp;#39;t make it so Smyrna is appointed to</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="4.56">be martyrs but to help those five</text>
  <text start="427.17" dur="3.51">congregations and it says write down the</text>
  <text start="429.36" dur="4.04">scriptures they&amp;#39;re gonna you know these</text>
  <text start="430.68" dur="5.37">people are going to get held captive</text>
  <text start="433.4" dur="4.09">killed by flame by sword by all these</text>
  <text start="436.05" dur="3.39">things because they&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="437.49" dur="3.24">persecuted but they know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="439.44" dur="3.45">called to that because they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="440.73" dur="4.11">help lead the other five congregations</text>
  <text start="442.89" dur="3.93">those other types of believers through</text>
  <text start="444.84" dur="4.29">the Great Tribulation as the son of</text>
  <text start="446.82" dur="4.47">perdition is making war against the</text>
  <text start="449.13" dur="3.9">saints and using the guillotines to cut</text>
  <text start="451.29" dur="4.11">off their heads and it does say that the</text>
  <text start="453.03" dur="3.9">son perdition will prevail against the</text>
  <text start="455.4" dur="3.27">Saints for time for that three and a</text>
  <text start="456.93" dur="4.2">half year period but then of course</text>
  <text start="458.67" dur="5.76">Yasha will return and put everything</text>
  <text start="461.13" dur="4.38">right so right now filled up in Smyrna</text>
  <text start="464.43" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s sort of one group of people</text>
  <text start="465.51" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re all being raised up to teach and</text>
  <text start="467.76" dur="4.71">lead but there&amp;#39;s gonna be a split and</text>
  <text start="469.95" dur="5.46">those who are called to be martyrs and I</text>
  <text start="472.47" dur="5.1">talked to a believer many years ago and</text>
  <text start="475.41" dur="3.51">he said he&amp;#39;s like Daniel I know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="477.57" dur="3.69">been called to be a martyr I just know</text>
  <text start="478.92" dur="4.59">it I had this vision and he shared with</text>
  <text start="481.26" dur="5.55">me I was like well that&amp;#39;s what y&amp;#39;all it</text>
  <text start="483.51" dur="5.82">in your heart then okay but I know that</text>
  <text start="486.81" dur="5.35">what is in my heart is to pray Luke 21</text>
  <text start="489.33" dur="4.66">so people will know</text>
  <text start="492.16" dur="3.65">where the call to I think everyone</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="4.77">should try to be part of Philadelphia</text>
  <text start="495.81" dur="4.15">but yet there are people that are going</text>
  <text start="498.76" dur="3.96">to be called with this and it may be</text>
  <text start="499.96" dur="4.65">just people that for whatever reason yon</text>
  <text start="502.72" dur="3.81">knows that their testimony is going to</text>
  <text start="504.61" dur="4.44">be much better if they become martyrs</text>
  <text start="506.53" dur="4.98">just like you know I&amp;#39;ll share with Keith</text>
  <text start="509.05" dur="4.92">green I love Keith green he was one of</text>
  <text start="511.51" dur="4.469">the most annoying Tanisha&amp;#39;s he gave all</text>
  <text start="513.97" dur="5.449">his music away for free he only received</text>
  <text start="515.979" dur="6.721">voluntary donations and he just you know</text>
  <text start="519.419" dur="5.861">his music is so powerful and yet he died</text>
  <text start="522.7" dur="5.49">so young he died at age 28 in that in</text>
  <text start="525.28" dur="4.56">that plane crash and there&amp;#39;s a scripture</text>
  <text start="528.19" dur="4.77">that was used at his funeral back in</text>
  <text start="529.84" dur="6.39">1982 was that if a seed dies in</text>
  <text start="532.96" dur="4.68">perishable that will come and you know</text>
  <text start="536.23" dur="4.62">bring back one hundredfold or whatever</text>
  <text start="537.64" dur="4.74">and I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing that verse but the</text>
  <text start="540.85" dur="3.93">point is is that because of Keith&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.38" dur="4.68">death it actually wound up reaching even</text>
  <text start="544.78" dur="4.92">far more people than he did during his</text>
  <text start="547.06" dur="5.43">life so so that you know that was sort</text>
  <text start="549.7" dur="7.32">of an example of sort of a precursor or</text>
  <text start="552.49" dur="5.79">pre shadow foreshadow of smyrna so so i</text>
  <text start="557.02" dur="3">just wanted to make that clear but</text>
  <text start="558.28" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s kind of what makes the the to</text>
  <text start="560.02" dur="4.5">reach distinctive and with philadelphia</text>
  <text start="563.47" dur="3.45">because i&amp;#39;ve had a lot of people say</text>
  <text start="564.52" dur="4.35">well daniel do a more in-depth study of</text>
  <text start="566.92" dur="3.57">Philadelphia with Philadelphia it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="568.87" dur="4.17">really it&amp;#39;s really very simple</text>
  <text start="570.49" dur="4.35">you know Yahshua commands everyone in</text>
  <text start="573.04" dur="3.96">Luke 21 he says pray that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="574.84" dur="3.99">accounted worthy and so that&amp;#39;s what I do</text>
  <text start="577" dur="4.05">I pray and I pray that he will graph me</text>
  <text start="578.83" dur="4.92">into Philadelphia and then what happens</text>

  <text start="738.4" dur="2.55">by the way I&amp;#39;m not preaching against gun</text>
  <text start="740.38" dur="3.06">ownership</text>
  <text start="740.95" dur="4.29">I mean Yahshua did say to Peter hey you</text>
  <text start="743.44" dur="3.45">know make sure you guys sell your cloak</text>
  <text start="745.24" dur="3.57">and buy some weapons and Peter said well</text>
  <text start="746.89" dur="3.63">I got these two swords is this enough</text>
  <text start="748.81" dur="3.33">and Yahshua said that&amp;#39;s enough so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="750.52" dur="3.42">not I&amp;#39;m not advocating against</text>
  <text start="752.14" dur="3.69">self-defense or gun ownership what I am</text>
  <text start="753.94" dur="2.97">saying is we&amp;#39;re in that period of where</text>
  <text start="755.83" dur="3.18">the beast is ruling it</text>
  <text start="756.91" dur="3.48">three amperes you can&amp;#39;t be launching</text>
  <text start="759.01" dur="3.66">attack against the Beast because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="760.39" dur="4.68">gonna lose it&amp;#39;s been a point that yah</text>
  <text start="762.67" dur="5.25">himself is sending this delusion upon</text>
  <text start="765.07" dur="5.61">the people of the world to try them and</text>
  <text start="767.92" dur="4.74">to test them and to prove them so just</text>
  <text start="770.68" dur="4.83">keep that in mind so you have to know</text>
  <text start="772.66" dur="4.71">the word of his patience and I will also</text>
  <text start="775.51" dur="3.3">keep you from the hour of temptation so</text>
  <text start="777.37" dur="4.23">this is exactly like the words that</text>
  <text start="778.81" dur="4.23">Yahshua spoke in Luke 21 pray that he be</text>
  <text start="781.6" dur="3.9">kind of worthy to escape all these</text>
  <text start="783.04" dur="4.17">things and to stand before the son of</text>
  <text start="785.5" dur="3.83">men which shall come upon all the world</text>
  <text start="787.21" dur="4.77">to try them that dwell upon the earth</text>

  <text start="791.98" dur="4.95">which the house that no man take your</text>
  <text start="793.42" dur="5.22">crown because even those in Philadelphia</text>
  <text start="796.93" dur="3.24">if you don&amp;#39;t hold fast what you have</text>
  <text start="798.64" dur="2.25">people can take your crown and then</text>
  <text start="800.17" dur="3.33">you&amp;#39;re not going to be in Philadelphia</text>

  <text start="803.5" dur="3.92">this Great Tribulation to be tried and</text>
  <text start="804.94" dur="5.22">tested so it&amp;#39;s very important to</text>
  <text start="807.42" dur="4.36">persevere in him and then it gives the</text>
  <text start="810.16" dur="4.1">promise and by the way there are</text>
  <text start="811.78" dur="5.25">promises given to all seven Assemblies</text>
