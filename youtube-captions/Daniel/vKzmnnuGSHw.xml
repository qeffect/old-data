  <text start="11.309" dur="5.101">Trumpets feast of shouting has come to</text>
  <text start="14.13" dur="5.52">an end it&amp;#39;s dark here now on the west</text>
  <text start="16.41" dur="7.289">coast and I just wanted to share</text>
  <text start="19.65" dur="6.24">something on my heart I really feel it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="23.699" dur="4.351">very important to share in it I mean I</text>
  <text start="25.89" dur="3.93">was as soon as the Shabbat was over I</text>
  <text start="28.05" dur="6">was gonna go and do some things and and</text>
  <text start="29.82" dur="7.55">I I just can&amp;#39;t I got it I got to share</text>
  <text start="34.05" dur="9.329">this what&amp;#39;s y&amp;#39;all&amp;#39;s put on my heart</text>
  <text start="37.37" dur="7.75">because I think it&amp;#39;s so important sorry</text>
  <text start="43.379" dur="4.621">about that</text>
  <text start="45.12" dur="6.599">if you go to Romans chapter 8 starting</text>
  <text start="48" dur="5.699">in verse 26 Paul he writes he says</text>
  <text start="51.719" dur="5.191">likewise the spirit also helps our</text>
  <text start="53.699" dur="5.371">infirmities for we know what we should</text>
  <text start="56.91" dur="3.629">pray for for we know not what we should</text>
  <text start="59.07" dur="4.41">pray for as we ought but the Spirit</text>
  <text start="60.539" dur="6.541">itself makes intercession for us with</text>
  <text start="63.48" dur="5.79">groanings which cannot be uttered and he</text>
  <text start="67.08" dur="3.93">that searches the hearts knows what is</text>
  <text start="69.27" dur="3.63">the mind of the Spirit because he makes</text>
  <text start="71.01" dur="7.02">intercession for the saints according to</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="7.14">the will of yah so I don&amp;#39;t know if you</text>
  <text start="78.03" dur="6.96">who are listening I&amp;#39;ve ever experienced</text>
  <text start="80.04" dur="6.689">this but you know Paul is talking about</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="5.1">how there are times where the Spirit</text>
  <text start="86.729" dur="5.131">will so fill you that you you don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="90.09" dur="3.69">know how to pray you don&amp;#39;t begin to know</text>
  <text start="91.86" dur="5.13">how to pray and so you have this almost</text>
  <text start="93.78" dur="5.49">internal groaning and and all you can do</text>
  <text start="96.99" dur="4.019">is just sort of cry out with this this</text>
  <text start="99.27" dur="3.45">inward groan that the Spirit is putting</text>
  <text start="101.009" dur="4.261">in you and you don&amp;#39;t even know exactly</text>
  <text start="102.72" dur="7.05">what or how to pray but but he&amp;#39;s praying</text>
  <text start="105.27" dur="6.12">within you and it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a deep spirit</text>
  <text start="109.77" dur="4.23">of intercession and in fact if you read</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="4.65">you know history you&amp;#39;ll find that the</text>
  <text start="114" dur="4.38">great men of Yaphet that yeah I used to</text>
  <text start="116.04" dur="4.439">start major revivals and and works of</text>
  <text start="118.38" dur="5.58">yah throughout history</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="7.4">these men started in their prayer closet</text>
  <text start="123.96" dur="6.57">just with the Spirit of intercession and</text>
  <text start="127.879" dur="4.511">so I&amp;#39;ve experienced this in my life but</text>
  <text start="130.53" dur="3.039">not not for a long time but I have</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="3.909">experienced this many</text>
  <text start="133.569" dur="4.89">many years ago but as yom teruah was</text>
  <text start="136.299" dur="4.2">ending I mean literally as you know we</text>
  <text start="138.459" dur="5.45">were entering the twilight hours and and</text>
  <text start="140.499" dur="7.981">the last few hours of yom teruah were</text>
  <text start="143.909" dur="6.73">we&amp;#39;re occurring this just overwhelming</text>
  <text start="148.48" dur="3.39">spirit of intercession filled me i mean</text>
  <text start="150.639" dur="2.791">it was like it&amp;#39;s the point where i</text>
  <text start="151.87" dur="4.319">couldn&amp;#39;t get off my face and it was just</text>
  <text start="153.43" dur="4.41">like this deep groaning that i haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="156.189" dur="4.851">experienced in years and it was just</text>
  <text start="157.84" dur="6.03">like oh i was so overwhelming and i</text>
  <text start="161.04" dur="3.94">didn&amp;#39;t really know exactly again sort of</text>
  <text start="163.87" dur="3.209">like what paul says is like i didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="164.98" dur="3.81">know how to prayer what to pray but i</text>
  <text start="167.079" dur="4.53">knew he was praying within me and then</text>
  <text start="168.79" dur="5.64">and then yah help me my infirmities</text>
  <text start="171.609" dur="5.36">because he showed me that it was this</text>
  <text start="174.43" dur="6.179">intense burden for the bride of Messiah</text>
  <text start="176.969" dur="7.02">for those who call themselves lovers of</text>
  <text start="180.609" dur="7.651">him to pray for the bride because of</text>
  <text start="183.989" dur="7.511">what&amp;#39;s about to happen to pray for the</text>
  <text start="188.26" dur="7.129">people of yah all across the earth to be</text>
  <text start="191.5" dur="3.889">prepared for what is about to happen</text>
  <text start="197.609" dur="6.761">because you know you can read about the</text>
  <text start="202.75" dur="3.449">things that happen in Revelation you can</text>
  <text start="204.37" dur="3.75">read Yahshua&amp;#39;s words and his warnings</text>
  <text start="206.199" dur="5.25">and Matthew 24 you can read these things</text>
  <text start="208.12" dur="5.22">but but to actually experience what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="211.449" dur="4.201">gonna happen on this earth when when</text>
  <text start="213.34" dur="3.69">these things actually transpire and by</text>
  <text start="215.65" dur="4.019">the way we&amp;#39;re already in the beginning</text>
  <text start="217.03" dur="4.709">birth pains because you know Yahshua</text>
  <text start="219.669" dur="4.051">said you know there&amp;#39;ll be famines and</text>
  <text start="221.739" dur="3.481">earthquakes in diverse places nation</text>
  <text start="223.72" dur="3.449">will rise up against nation there&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="225.22" dur="2.4">wars and rumors of wars but the end is</text>
  <text start="227.169" dur="3.301">not yet</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="4.56">this is just the beginning don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="230.47" dur="4.349">the ends here it&amp;#39;s not yet this is just</text>
  <text start="232.18" dur="5.639">the beginning the birth pains so those</text>
  <text start="234.819" dur="6.9">are here but but when we actually go</text>
  <text start="237.819" dur="5.971">through this thing called the the you</text>
  <text start="241.719" dur="5.341">know the the Great Tribulation I mean</text>
  <text start="243.79" dur="6.149">that the this intense tensely sorrowful</text>
  <text start="247.06" dur="5.099">time in Yakov&amp;#39;s trouble it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="249.939" dur="4.26">unlike anything you really have ever</text>
  <text start="252.159" dur="4.161">experienced because the scripture says I</text>
  <text start="254.199" dur="4.741">mean says the world is never ever</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="4.27">experienced as much trouble as that will</text>
  <text start="258.94" dur="3.719">experience during this time and I mean</text>
  <text start="260.59" dur="4.139">if you look at the last 6,000 years of</text>
  <text start="262.659" dur="3.671">mankind&amp;#39;s history I mean there have been</text>
  <text start="264.729" dur="5.051">some pretty bad major</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="6.059">have happened but you know the scripture</text>
  <text start="269.78" dur="5.18">clearly says that nothing was going to</text>
  <text start="272.389" dur="5.55">compare to how bad it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="274.96" dur="4.6">especially when Satan himself is thrown</text>
  <text start="277.939" dur="4.41">down to the earth and he knows his time</text>
  <text start="279.56" dur="5.609">is short and and for 42 months he&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="282.349" dur="6.72">know he&amp;#39;s hunting down the faithful few</text>

  <text start="385.789" dur="4.951">I took my shofar and I went up there and</text>
  <text start="388.25" dur="3.93">I got there and and then he told me I</text>
  <text start="390.74" dur="3.269">you know I was at this point where I</text>
  <text start="392.18" dur="4.5">blew the shofar three times and this</text>
  <text start="394.009" dur="4">sort of concentric circle formed out of</text>
  <text start="396.68" dur="4.03">this rock this</text>
  <text start="398.009" dur="4.951">Riverstone rock and blew it three times</text>
  <text start="400.71" dur="4.139">toward toward the east toward where</text>
  <text start="402.96" dur="4.47">Portland was because I was to the west</text>
  <text start="404.849" dur="5.04">of Portland and then I blew it a fourth</text>
  <text start="407.43" dur="4.53">time on this sort of grassy knoll in the</text>
  <text start="409.889" dur="5.31">shadow for a face in Portland I blew it</text>
  <text start="411.96" dur="5.189">a fifth time right next to this you know</text>
  <text start="415.199" dur="4.411">beautiful rock wall where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="417.149" dur="5.58">literally facing the whole of Portland</text>
  <text start="419.61" dur="6.209">and then I went around the circle to the</text>
  <text start="422.729" dur="6.06">to the to the western edge looking east</text>
  <text start="425.819" dur="5.07">and I blew it two more times once I in</text>
  <text start="428.789" dur="4.5">the this hill looking you know toward</text>
  <text start="430.889" dur="4.95">basically the ocean you know the the</text>
  <text start="433.289" dur="4.081">whole western section of Portland the</text>
  <text start="435.839" dur="3.6">suburbs and going out toward the ocean</text>
  <text start="437.37" dur="3.479">and then went down to that the bottom of</text>
  <text start="439.439" dur="3.96">there where there was a wall and blew it</text>
  <text start="440.849" dur="5.25">again and and during the seven times</text>
  <text start="443.399" dur="5.01">that I blew the shofar there were two</text>
  <text start="446.099" dur="4.74">people that I was able to speak with and</text>
  <text start="448.409" dur="3.72">witness to actually there was some there</text>
  <text start="450.839" dur="3.181">are some young children too that I got</text>
  <text start="452.129" dur="3.09">to that was a blessing they were they</text>
  <text start="454.02" dur="3.06">thought my shofar I was so cool and they</text>
  <text start="455.219" dur="3.48">came up and wanted to touch it and that</text>
  <text start="457.08" dur="3.69">was a blessing but no there was these</text>

  <text start="464.729" dur="4.92">to them and give him a card to my</text>
  <text start="467.399" dur="3.931">website but but there so there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="469.649" dur="3.031">people that yah had me witness which</text>
  <text start="471.33" dur="3.989">again that&amp;#39;s the whole point right where</text>
  <text start="472.68" dur="3.539">we&amp;#39;re supposed to be winning the loss</text>
  <text start="475.319" dur="3.06">we&amp;#39;re supposed to be out there</text>

  <text start="1145.59" dur="3">that&amp;#39;s the whole point right because</text>
  <text start="1147.119" dur="4.14">everything&amp;#39;s created for his good</text>
