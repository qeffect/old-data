  <text start="17.789" dur="6.15">well something pretty crazy happened</text>
  <text start="20.91" dur="5.67">this morning because of the video that I</text>
  <text start="23.939" dur="6.061">made yesterday the one about Isaiah 28</text>

  <text start="30" dur="5.19">way that was a video that you know I</text>
  <text start="32.55" dur="5.37">spoke really highly of Pastor Rick and</text>

  <text start="56.73" dur="3">I knew it might have been a little bit</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="3.84">upset about it but I you know I thought</text>
  <text start="59.73" dur="4.259">you know it would be fine but I found it</text>
  <text start="62.1" dur="3.629">early this morning that that Rick was</text>
  <text start="63.989" dur="5.731">very upset Pastor Rick was very upset</text>
  <text start="65.729" dur="5.701">about me posting that video he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="69.72" dur="2.939">really give a good reason why I mean he</text>
  <text start="71.43" dur="2.85">said you know why am i condemning</text>
  <text start="72.659" dur="3.061">everyone and I said I&amp;#39;m not committed</text>
  <text start="74.28" dur="3.54">I&amp;#39;m not condemning anyone I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="75.72" dur="3.96">saying if they don&amp;#39;t repent they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="77.82" dur="3.96">gonna to like a fire and that&amp;#39;s true I</text>
  <text start="79.68" dur="4.14">mean that&amp;#39;s you can find that in 1st</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="3.449">Corinthians 6 9 through 11 I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="3.15">that&amp;#39;s a warning that&amp;#39;s given all</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="3.451">through scriptures about if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="3.509">living in unrepentant sin and you claim</text>
  <text start="88.68" dur="3.119">to be a believer you&amp;#39;re headed for the</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="4.71">lake of fire unless you repent that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="91.799" dur="5.311">just a basic doctrine but in any case he</text>
  <text start="95.189" dur="3.991">was really upset and he basically told</text>
  <text start="97.11" dur="5.31">me to leave he told me to pack up all my</text>
  <text start="99.18" dur="6.689">things and collect all my stuff and I</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="5.46">was banned from from Cornerstone and as</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="2.521">I was picking things up and packing my</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="2.91">car</text>
  <text start="108.39" dur="4.619">he did say well you know me and Dale</text>
  <text start="110.79" dur="3.869">we&amp;#39;re gonna try to talk to you not this</text>
  <text start="113.009" dur="4.5">week but next Thursday we&amp;#39;ll try to get</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="5.221">to you which you know I&amp;#39;m great I do</text>
  <text start="117.509" dur="5.341">hope that we can work this out but I</text>
  <text start="119.88" dur="5.22">mean it&amp;#39;s kind of really kind of cold</text>
  <text start="122.85" dur="4.14">because I mean we have the eighth day</text>
  <text start="125.1" dur="3.659">which is a commanded gathering you know</text>
  <text start="126.99" dur="3.749">the eighth day is the high the high</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="4.021">Shabbat that&amp;#39;s command a gathering and</text>
  <text start="130.739" dur="2.971">for him and Dale just to kind of cut me</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="2.67">off and not</text>
  <text start="133.71" dur="5.52">we go just because I posted a video in</text>
  <text start="135.45" dur="5.7">obedience to yah Diwali spirit and then</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="3.42">Rick even said something he said well I</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="3.48">don&amp;#39;t think yeah I told you to do that</text>
  <text start="142.65" dur="4.08">which that&amp;#39;s really wicked because I</text>
  <text start="144.63" dur="5.06">mean his sheep know his voice and I know</text>
  <text start="146.73" dur="6.18">Yas Weiss but here&amp;#39;s the testimony part</text>
  <text start="149.69" dur="5.65">once he kicked me off of cornerstone and</text>
  <text start="152.91" dur="6.06">and banned me from the rest of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="155.34" dur="5.34">this just intense joy just started</text>
  <text start="158.97" dur="3.81">flooding my soul and it was like I</text>
  <text start="160.68" dur="3.54">started feeling Yasha in fact it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="4.56">happening even right now but I feel</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="5.1">Yasha was present so intensely and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="3.39">like he&amp;#39;s just he&amp;#39;s being so gracious to</text>
  <text start="169.32" dur="3.21">me because I don&amp;#39;t deserve this but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="4.32">just it&amp;#39;s like josh is saying Daniel I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="172.53" dur="5.37">happy I&amp;#39;m happy with you you did what I</text>
  <text start="175.05" dur="4.92">told you to do well done well done and</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;ve just been bubbling up a joy and</text>
  <text start="179.97" dur="5.13">actually I was reading again or</text>
  <text start="182.22" dur="4.5">meditating upon Romans 8:28 that all</text>
  <text start="185.1" dur="3.66">things work for the good to them who</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="3.9">love him and since I got kicked off of</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="5.73">Cornerstone I&amp;#39;ve been driving around</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="5.19">Salem and in Portland and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="194.49" dur="2.82">running into a number of people that</text>
  <text start="195.81" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;ve been able to minister to just one</text>
  <text start="197.31" dur="4.95">on one in fact I was that a a mall</text>
  <text start="199.95" dur="4.92">earlier today and this older guy was</text>
  <text start="202.26" dur="5.1">helping me out and he actually he</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="4.2">actually was very very well-versed in</text>
  <text start="207.36" dur="3.03">the Messianic Jewish understanding of</text>
  <text start="209.07" dur="3.3">which was really refreshing we had a</text>
  <text start="210.39" dur="4.23">very edifying conversation so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="212.37" dur="3.72">actually been a blessing that Rick and</text>
  <text start="214.62" dur="3.57">and and the leadership of Cornerstone</text>
  <text start="216.09" dur="5.25">have kicked me off because Yasha has</text>
  <text start="218.19" dur="4.74">been overwhelming me so you know I do</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="3.48">pray that Pastor Rick will repent</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="4.8">because this is this is wicked you know</text>
  <text start="224.82" dur="4.86">he&amp;#39;s basically saying if one of his</text>
  <text start="227.73" dur="3.75">people his congregation does what yah</text>
  <text start="229.68" dur="3.15">tells me to do and you know when yot</text>
  <text start="231.48" dur="3.03">tells me to do something I got to do I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="232.83" dur="3.06">responsible for my ministry to our</text>
  <text start="234.51" dur="3.06">restoration ministries but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.89" dur="3.09">basically saying if you do it but God</text>
  <text start="237.57" dur="3.45">tells you do and he doesn&amp;#39;t like it then</text>
  <text start="238.98" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;re you get the boot and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="241.02" dur="6.36">right pastor shouldn&amp;#39;t have that type of</text>
  <text start="242.7" dur="7.02">control and furthermore I mean I talked</text>
  <text start="247.38" dur="3.96">to Rick and and and he said he and Dale</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="3.57">actually agreed with most of what I put</text>
  <text start="251.34" dur="3.51">in the video they they just one thing is</text>
  <text start="253.29" dur="3.15">they they didn&amp;#39;t like me filming it at</text>
  <text start="254.85" dur="2.94">the church which I actually agreed with</text>
  <text start="256.44" dur="2.97">him I I should have tried to find like a</text>
  <text start="257.79" dur="3.96">park like I should have filmed it here</text>
  <text start="259.41" dur="4.53">but still I mean the fact that I did not</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="3.96">film in a park is not a reason to kick</text>
  <text start="263.94" dur="3.19">me out of Cornerstone and not even meet</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="3.7">with me until next</text>
  <text start="267.13" dur="5.13">week sometime I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="269.41" dur="5.1">silly but anyway I just I&amp;#39;m praying that</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="3.69">Rick will repent because I really do</text>
  <text start="274.51" dur="3.45">believe that yah wants to use</text>
  <text start="275.95" dur="3.48">Cornerstone I mean there&amp;#39;s been such a</text>
  <text start="277.96" dur="3.66">powerful move of the Spirit and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.43" dur="3.9">been so many good things but I think the</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="3.69">enemy you know the enemy doesn&amp;#39;t want it</text>
  <text start="283.33" dur="3.93">to happen and and I know you sent me</text>
  <text start="285.31" dur="3.45">there and he sent two others there</text>
  <text start="287.26" dur="3.45">Sophie and Brett as well because they</text>
  <text start="288.76" dur="4.29">showed up a couple weeks after me and I</text>
  <text start="290.71" dur="5.49">know Yas sent us us three there for a</text>
  <text start="293.05" dur="5.16">purpose in fact one of the members even</text>
  <text start="296.2" dur="3.66">testified it out to us a couple nights</text>
  <text start="298.21" dur="4.14">ago Dorothy she said she really believed</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="3.93">that so for Rick to ban me this this is</text>
  <text start="302.35" dur="3.57">you know he&amp;#39;s basically setting himself</text>
  <text start="303.79" dur="6.06">not against me but against what y&amp;#39;all&amp;#39;s</text>
