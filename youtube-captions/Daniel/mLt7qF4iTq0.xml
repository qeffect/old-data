  <text start="59.3" dur="5.74">impeachment President Vladimir Putin has</text>
  <text start="63.09" dur="3.87">actually weighed in he says the u.s.</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="4.56">President Donald Trump&amp;#39;s impeachment is</text>
  <text start="66.96" dur="6.78">far-fetched and predicts the US Senate</text>
  <text start="69.6" dur="6.089">will reject it Russian President</text>
  <text start="73.74" dur="4.98">Vladimir Putin said Thursday that US</text>
  <text start="75.689" dur="5.61">President Donald Trump&amp;#39;s was impeached</text>
  <text start="78.72" dur="4.35">for far-fetched reasons calling the move</text>
  <text start="81.299" dur="4.14">by Democrats a continuation of their</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="4.29">fight against the Republican leader it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="85.439" dur="4.351">simply a continuation of internal</text>
  <text start="87.36" dur="3.99">political struggle Putin said at his</text>
  <text start="89.79" dur="4.41">end-of-the-year news conference in</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="4.8">Moscow the party that lost the 2016</text>
  <text start="94.2" dur="4.709">election the Democratic Party is trying</text>
  <text start="96.15" dur="4.56">to achieve results by other means he</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="4.231">likened Trump&amp;#39;s impeachment to the</text>
  <text start="100.71" dur="5.1">earlier us probe into collusion with</text>
  <text start="103.14" dur="5.22">Russia which Putin played down as</text>
  <text start="105.81" dur="4.169">groundless former Special Counsel Robert</text>
  <text start="108.36" dur="3.48">Mueller concluded earlier this year that</text>
  <text start="109.979" dur="6.061">the Russian government interfered in the</text>
  <text start="111.84" dur="6.48">2016 US presidential election in a quote</text>
  <text start="116.04" dur="4.92">sweeping and systematic fashion</text>
  <text start="118.32" dur="5.399">now they invented some sort of pressure</text>
  <text start="120.96" dur="5.009">on Ukraine Putin said referring to the</text>
  <text start="123.719" dur="3.69">investigation of trumps trying to enlist</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="3.301">the president of that country to</text>
  <text start="127.409" dur="6.081">announce investigations of his political</text>
  <text start="129.27" dur="6.63">rival as he withheld USA aid to Ukraine</text>
  <text start="133.49" dur="7.15">Trump on Wednesday became only the third</text>
  <text start="135.9" dur="7.14">American president to be impeached so so</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="5.25">Vladimir Putin President of Russia is</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="6.29">basically saying yeah this is the</text>
  <text start="145.89" dur="6.15">Democrats desperate gamble to try to</text>
  <text start="149.33" dur="5.56">impeach a president based off completely</text>
  <text start="152.04" dur="4.23">fraudulent means and it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="5.04">because I had reported earlier this</text>
  <text start="156.27" dur="6.51">summer that you know Vladimir Putin had</text>
  <text start="159.93" dur="6.27">also come out against Satanic pedophilia</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="6.57">in a very very very strong terms and now</text>
  <text start="166.2" dur="4.29">he&amp;#39;s speaking up about this so very</text>
  <text start="169.35" dur="4.89">interesting to hear from him</text>

  <text start="298.53" dur="5.13">go to the Senate where this has to be</text>
  <text start="300.48" dur="4.89">tried right of course for some reason it</text>
  <text start="303.66" dur="6.06">seems like Nancy Pelosi is very hesitant</text>

  <text start="670.4" dur="3.93">is really what Democratic leaders in</text>
  <text start="672.05" dur="4.05">Virginia want because what it equates to</text>
  <text start="674.33" dur="4.65">is a tyrannical government using its</text>

  <text start="718.25" dur="3.8">article I&amp;#39;ll post this below the video</text>
  <text start="719.75" dur="5.4">so you guys can look at this as well but</text>
  <text start="722.05" dur="6.25">yeah I think that this whole idea that</text>
  <text start="725.15" dur="5.25">the Virginia governor has to I mean</text>
  <text start="728.3" dur="4.38">let&amp;#39;s face it this is what he&amp;#39;s done he</text>
  <text start="730.4" dur="4.08">wants to completely and totally trample</text>
  <text start="732.68" dur="4.22">the Second Amendment right in Virginia</text>
  <text start="734.48" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s what he wants to do and so I</text>
  <text start="736.9" dur="2.8">don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s gonna be too successful</text>
  <text start="738.83" dur="2.82">in doing that</text>
  <text start="739.7" dur="3.81">I know I&amp;#39;ve heard some people saying oh</text>
  <text start="741.65" dur="3.48">you know this may lead to a civil war</text>
  <text start="743.51" dur="3.18">well not based on what this guy&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="745.13" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s saying that even the National Guard</text>
  <text start="746.69" dur="3.72">who&amp;#39;d be ordered by the governor to</text>
  <text start="748.88" dur="3.72">arrest police others that aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="750.41" dur="3.36">carrying out this law that even the</text>
  <text start="752.6" dur="2.85">National Guard&amp;#39;s not gonna comply</text>
  <text start="753.77" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;ll just say no we&amp;#39;re laying out our</text>
  <text start="755.45" dur="3.68">weapons we&amp;#39;re not going to comply and so</text>
  <text start="757.58" dur="4.71">basically the governor would be</text>
  <text start="759.13" dur="5.47">toothless wouldn&amp;#39;t have any any ability</text>
  <text start="762.29" dur="3.63">to enforce what he wants to do so we</text>
  <text start="764.6" dur="3.81">need to be praying for this situation</text>
  <text start="765.92" dur="4.74">obviously the deep state is the one that</text>
  <text start="768.41" dur="4.55">wants civil war the deep state is the</text>
  <text start="770.66" dur="4.95">one that wants our nation ripped apart</text>
  <text start="772.96" dur="4.9">and I think that the good people of</text>
  <text start="775.61" dur="5.33">Virginia are responding and reacting in</text>
  <text start="777.86" dur="6.18">just the right way oh yeah</text>
  <text start="780.94" dur="5.17">on Friday I talked about Christianity</text>
  <text start="784.04" dur="4.59">today I hesitate to even call it</text>
  <text start="786.11" dur="5.1">Christianity but Christianity today who</text>
  <text start="788.63" dur="4.53">wrote a just an outrageous article</text>

  <text start="793.16" dur="2.1">magazine</text>
  <text start="793.91" dur="3.72">he said that President Trump should be</text>
  <text start="795.26" dur="5.7">removed from office and I got an article</text>

  <text start="827.06" dur="3.84">Christianity today it&amp;#39;s unbelievable</text>

  <text start="845.18" dur="6.6">the evidence may even suggest Obama is</text>
  <text start="847.43" dur="5.85">our evangelical and chief what what the</text>
  <text start="851.78" dur="3.39">article even questioned why we would</text>
  <text start="853.28" dur="4.2">prefer the Republican candidate over</text>
  <text start="855.17" dur="5.85">Obama since Obama&amp;#39;s beliefs were closer</text>

  <text start="861.02" dur="2.94">another quote while there are plenty of</text>
  <text start="862.58" dur="3.21">legitimate policy reasons that</text>
