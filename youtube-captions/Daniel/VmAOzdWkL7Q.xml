  <text start="469.61" dur="5.43">Trump but by Obama himself and Hillary</text>
  <text start="472.28" dur="4.32">so she was talked about that before</text>
  <text start="475.04" dur="3.66">so Mueller I do not believe is gonna be</text>
  <text start="476.6" dur="3.72">able to get away with this in fact this</text>
  <text start="478.7" dur="6">is a mean that I want to show everyone I</text>
  <text start="480.32" dur="6.45">hope it comes up on the screen but Obama</text>
  <text start="484.7" dur="5.64">you know says hey look I wrote executive</text>
  <text start="486.77" dur="5.55">order 13526 section 1.7 which has an</text>
  <text start="490.34" dur="3.78">occasional classified information failed</text>
  <text start="492.32" dur="4.23">to be beast classified in order to</text>
  <text start="494.12" dur="5.01">conceal violations of the law and Trump</text>
  <text start="496.55" dur="5.01">says I know you did and I&amp;#39;m going to use</text>
  <text start="499.13" dur="4.8">your executive order to expose your</text>
  <text start="501.56" dur="6.09">treasonous crimes and nail your ass to</text>
  <text start="503.93" dur="6.09">the wall so so that&amp;#39;s the meme that</text>
  <text start="507.65" dur="3.87">storm is upon us put together but we</text>
  <text start="510.02" dur="3.66">need to remember that that executive</text>
  <text start="511.52" dur="5.22">order is in place and it will be used</text>
  <text start="513.68" dur="4.95">and Trump will be ELISA that&amp;#39;s again I</text>
  <text start="516.74" dur="4.02">think falls right into the theme that</text>

  <text start="542.89" dur="7.889">Mordecai actually he wound up being hung</text>
  <text start="545.74" dur="6.659">upon so this is Obama&amp;#39;s executive order</text>
  <text start="550.779" dur="3.391">that he specifically passed and</text>
  <text start="552.399" dur="4.891">President Trump will be able to use it</text>

  <text start="639.25" dur="4.829">subscribers keep going up up up up but</text>
  <text start="641.829" dur="4.921">my view count on my videos really aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="644.079" dur="5.461">where they were and I&amp;#39;ve also noticed</text>
  <text start="646.75" dur="3.6">that Google is not monetizing excuse me</text>
  <text start="649.54" dur="2.85">not Google YouTube</text>
  <text start="650.35" dur="3.39">I guess there&amp;#39;s one the same YouTube in</text>
  <text start="652.39" dur="3.33">Google but they&amp;#39;re not monetizing my</text>
  <text start="653.74" dur="4.68">videos as much as they used to they keep</text>
  <text start="655.72" dur="5.19">saying that my content is not suitable</text>
  <text start="658.42" dur="5.51">for advertisers so I don&amp;#39;t know if this</text>
  <text start="660.91" dur="6.33">is a result of the recent push against</text>
  <text start="663.93" dur="5.92">pro-trump conservative viewpoints but I</text>
  <text start="667.24" dur="5.55">do know that you know president Trump is</text>
  <text start="669.85" dur="6.15">making an effort to push these antitrust</text>
  <text start="672.79" dur="5.729">laws to try to break up Google and</text>
  <text start="676" dur="5.009">YouTube and and and Facebook and and the</text>
  <text start="678.519" dur="7.351">monopolies that they have that they have</text>
  <text start="681.009" dur="9.39">basically had over the United States and</text>
  <text start="685.87" dur="6.87">over the world really which bolsters</text>
  <text start="690.399" dur="5.281">their ability to enforce their fascist</text>
  <text start="692.74" dur="5.279">policies of preventing other viewpoints</text>
  <text start="695.68" dur="4.67">from going forth but that&amp;#39;s something</text>
