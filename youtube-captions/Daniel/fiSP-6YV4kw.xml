  <text start="2.909" dur="6.9">sixth day of the week marched the 20th</text>
  <text start="5.42" dur="7.599">2015 and tonight at dusk as the Sun sets</text>
  <text start="9.809" dur="4.861">and evening settles across the land not</text>
  <text start="13.019" dur="4.291">only does it begin the normal weekly</text>
  <text start="14.67" dur="4.92">shabbat the warmer weekly Sabbath but it</text>
  <text start="17.31" dur="4.5">is also the new moon not only is it the</text>
  <text start="19.59" dur="3.72">new moon but it is the first new moon of</text>
  <text start="21.81" dur="3.719">the year because the spring equinox</text>
  <text start="23.31" dur="6.57">happened only a couple of hours ago</text>
  <text start="25.529" dur="6.48">about 3 45 p.m. pacific time 645 p.m.</text>
  <text start="29.88" dur="3.839">eastern time and of course we know from</text>
  <text start="32.009" dur="3.781">Scripture and if you&amp;#39;ve looked at the</text>
  <text start="33.719" dur="4.651">teachings on my website you can prove</text>
  <text start="35.79" dur="5.67">scripturally that the biblical hebrew</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="6.33">new year always begins on the first new</text>
  <text start="41.46" dur="4.74">moon after the spring equinox well this</text>
  <text start="44.7" dur="3.9">new moon begins tonight so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="46.2" dur="3.72">technically a couple of hours after the</text>
  <text start="48.6" dur="4.2">spring equinox this is about the</text>
  <text start="49.92" dur="7.02">earliest the new year can ever begin</text>
  <text start="52.8" dur="6.509">scripturally so happy new year everyone</text>
  <text start="56.94" dur="6.419">it is pretty amazing I&amp;#39;ve taken this</text>
  <text start="59.309" dur="6.63">picture from the Drudge Report and that</text>
  <text start="63.359" dur="4.591">is a picture of sin one of the very</text>
  <text start="65.939" dur="4.531">northern European islands where they are</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="5.73">actually able to see a total eclipse of</text>
  <text start="70.47" dur="4.5">the Sun earlier today many of you</text>
  <text start="73.68" dur="3.54">probably already know about this but</text>
  <text start="74.97" dur="4.469">today had three different astronomical</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="5.37">phenomenon is happening on the same day</text>
  <text start="79.439" dur="4.591">which is extremely rare you have the</text>
  <text start="82.59" dur="5.13">spring equinox of course that happens</text>
  <text start="84.03" dur="7.049">every year mmm that happened today at 3</text>
  <text start="87.72" dur="5.46">45 p.m. local time then you had a total</text>
  <text start="91.079" dur="3.571">eclipse of the Sun in some parts of</text>
  <text start="93.18" dur="4.38">northern Europe and also in the North</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="4.23">Pole and then in many parts of Europe</text>
  <text start="97.56" dur="3.989">and Asia in Africa they saw at least</text>
  <text start="98.88" dur="4.919">partial eclipses of the Sun and then of</text>
  <text start="101.549" dur="4.11">course you had a not only a new moon but</text>
  <text start="103.799" dur="4.68">it was a super new moon which means the</text>
  <text start="105.659" dur="6.39">moon was at its closest orbit to the</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="5.551">earth so slightly larger than it would</text>
  <text start="112.049" dur="4.11">normally appear in the sky so you have</text>
  <text start="114.03" dur="4.56">those three astronomical things</text>
  <text start="116.159" dur="4.801">happening all on the same day all at the</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="5.73">same time that is extremely rare it</text>
  <text start="120.96" dur="5.88">doesn&amp;#39;t happen very often at all for</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="3.19">there to be a spring equinox a super new</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="3.34">moon</text>
  <text start="127.51" dur="4.23">and a total eclipse of the Sun all</text>
  <text start="130.18" dur="4.17">happening on the same day but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.74" dur="4.83">even more amazing is that tonight begins</text>
  <text start="134.35" dur="3.99">the hebrew new year so you have these</text>
  <text start="136.57" dur="5.91">three major astronomical signs</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="6.48">coinciding with a major biblical date</text>
  <text start="142.48" dur="6.78">which is the new year what the Jews</text>
  <text start="144.82" dur="6.51">would referred to as 5775 and of course</text>
  <text start="149.26" dur="4.26">what I believe is more likely toward</text>
  <text start="151.33" dur="4.83">very close getting toward the year six</text>
  <text start="153.52" dur="3.84">thousand six thousand and one because I</text>
  <text start="156.16" dur="4.92">believe we&amp;#39;re very close to the time</text>
  <text start="157.36" dur="5.93">when Yahshua will return from the sky in</text>
  <text start="161.08" dur="6.51">glory and rule and reign from Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="6.85">so with those three amazing astronomical</text>
  <text start="167.59" dur="4.26">events happening it seems like Yahweh is</text>
  <text start="170.14" dur="3.3">definitely trying to communicate to the</text>
  <text start="171.85" dur="4.02">world because this was big news</text>
  <text start="173.44" dur="4.32">everywhere it was over Drudge Report it</text>
  <text start="175.87" dur="3.75">was on all the major news networks it</text>
  <text start="177.76" dur="3.15">was all across the world really people</text>
  <text start="179.62" dur="3.36">were going out looking at this total</text>
  <text start="180.91" dur="4.2">eclipse and reading about it&amp;#39;s all over</text>
  <text start="182.98" dur="4.26">the Internet more than any other</text>
  <text start="185.11" dur="3.33">generation history we can learn about</text>
  <text start="187.24" dur="4.02">and know about these things because</text>
  <text start="188.44" dur="5.549">they&amp;#39;re televised everywhere and so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.26" dur="4.68">like this huge thing has been spread out</text>
  <text start="193.989" dur="4.591">all across the earth we all know now</text>
  <text start="195.94" dur="5.13">that spring begins with a total solar</text>
  <text start="198.58" dur="4.89">eclipse of the Sun at the North Pole in</text>
  <text start="201.07" dur="4.29">some parts of northern Europe now</text>
  <text start="203.47" dur="3.78">usually when you talk about the total</text>
  <text start="205.36" dur="2.99">cups of the Sun it&amp;#39;s a bad omen most</text>
  <text start="207.25" dur="3.09">cultures believe it&amp;#39;s a bad omen</text>
  <text start="208.35" dur="3.31">biblically you can go to the book of</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="3.33">Joel you can go to the book of Acts you</text>
  <text start="211.66" dur="4.38">can read about how the day of the Lord</text>
  <text start="213.67" dur="4.41">will not come until the Sun turns to</text>
  <text start="216.04" dur="3.75">sackcloth and the moon turns to blood</text>
  <text start="218.08" dur="3.72">now of course many of you know that</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re in the middle of this tetrad of</text>
  <text start="221.8" dur="3.719">blood moons that have been occurring on</text>
  <text start="223.57" dur="4.02">the feast days we had the first to last</text>
  <text start="225.519" dur="3.991">year on both Passover and Sukkot and</text>
  <text start="227.59" dur="3.78">then we have the next to this year and</text>
  <text start="229.51" dur="4.08">the third one is just about to happen</text>
  <text start="231.37" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s going to happen on April fourth</text>
  <text start="233.59" dur="4.14">which is the first day of unleavened</text>
  <text start="234.7" dur="4.8">bread as Passover Week begins you have</text>
  <text start="237.73" dur="2.97">Passover on april third and then that</text>
  <text start="239.5" dur="3.239">night begins the first day of unleavened</text>
  <text start="240.7" dur="4.83">bread on and then on april four if you</text>
  <text start="242.739" dur="4.321">have a Blood Moon and we read in the</text>
  <text start="245.53" dur="3.63">scriptures again in Joel the book of</text>
  <text start="247.06" dur="4.35">Acts that the day of the Lord will not</text>
  <text start="249.16" dur="4.77">come until the Sun turns to sackcloth</text>
  <text start="251.41" dur="5.16">and the moon turns to blood in that</text>
  <text start="253.93" dur="4.02">order and here for I don&amp;#39;t know it seems</text>
  <text start="256.57" dur="3.03">like maybe the first time in a long time</text>
  <text start="257.95" dur="3.18">it certainly seems like a rare event</text>
  <text start="259.6" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re having the Sun</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="4.2">to sackcloth and then the moon turned to</text>
  <text start="263.23" dur="4.08">blood just like Joel in the book of Acts</text>
  <text start="265.33" dur="3.75">a will happen just before the day of the</text>
  <text start="267.31" dur="4.92">Lord begins the Sun is turning to</text>
  <text start="269.08" dur="6.42">sackcloth and then about 14 days later</text>
  <text start="272.23" dur="5.04">the moon turns to blood on Passover it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="275.5" dur="3.93">just amazing that the sun turning to</text>
  <text start="277.27" dur="4.62">sackcloth occurs on a major biblical day</text>
  <text start="279.43" dur="3.81">it is the Hebrew new year I know a lot</text>
  <text start="281.89" dur="3.03">of the Orthodox Jews will say the new</text>
  <text start="283.24" dur="3.48">year happens in september-october for</text>
  <text start="284.92" dur="3.09">rosh hashanah which they wrongly call</text>
  <text start="286.72" dur="4.17">you um true but that&amp;#39;s not true that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.01" dur="4.86">actually the 7th Hebrew year the first</text>
  <text start="290.89" dur="4.53">heat of the Sunni the 7th hebrew month</text>
  <text start="292.87" dur="5.07">the first hebrew month the month of aviv</text>
  <text start="295.42" dur="4.5">actually occurs anywhere from march to</text>
  <text start="297.94" dur="3.87">april depending on when the new moon</text>
  <text start="299.92" dur="4.26">occurs it is always the first to moon</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="4.05">after the spring equinox this is when</text>
  <text start="304.18" dur="2.97">all the barley will be a vivre</text>
  <text start="305.86" dur="3.36">throughout Israel and in fact if you go</text>
  <text start="307.15" dur="5.25">to Israel right now you will discover</text>
  <text start="309.22" dur="4.8">that a majority of the barley throughout</text>
  <text start="312.4" dur="3.54">all the land of israel from the northern</text>
  <text start="314.02" dur="4.71">tip to the southern tip is Aviv is ripe</text>
  <text start="315.94" dur="5.4">and we know now it is the new year it is</text>
  <text start="318.73" dur="5.55">the happy new year which means tonight</text>
  <text start="321.34" dur="4.98">starts day 1 and 10 days from now will</text>
  <text start="324.28" dur="4.02">be lambda when we&amp;#39;re commanded to select</text>
  <text start="326.32" dur="4.44">our lambs for Passover and then four</text>
  <text start="328.3" dur="4.8">days later on april third going into</text>
  <text start="330.76" dur="4.11">before if you have passover and then you</text>
  <text start="333.1" dur="5.16">have seven days of unleavened bread from</text>
  <text start="334.87" dur="4.59">abel forth until april 10th i believe so</text>
  <text start="338.26" dur="3.36">you have the seven days of unleavened</text>
  <text start="339.46" dur="4.17">bread and the feast of firstfruits in</text>
  <text start="341.62" dur="4.02">the midst of that as well which is a</text>
  <text start="343.63" dur="4.83">commanded feast so it&amp;#39;s just amazing</text>
  <text start="345.64" dur="5.28">that yeah is marking this new year with</text>
  <text start="348.46" dur="4.17">this total solar eclipse over the side</text>

  <text start="383.47" dur="6.96">wonder are we in for a very interesting</text>
  <text start="388.12" dur="4.799">year in terms of judgment in terms of</text>

  <text start="402.279" dur="5.25">moon the sun turning to sackcloth</text>
  <text start="405.489" dur="5.55">usually is a bad omen it&amp;#39;s an omen of of</text>
  <text start="407.529" dur="6">terror of judgement of the day of</text>
  <text start="411.039" dur="4.41">judgment coming so I&amp;#39;m not sure what</text>
  <text start="413.529" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re in store for for this year but I</text>
  <text start="415.449" dur="4.11">think it&amp;#39;s very significant that we had</text>
