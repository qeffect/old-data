  <text start="53.699" dur="3.54">thoroughfare of Colonial Williamsburg if</text>
  <text start="55.829" dur="2.851">you guys don&amp;#39;t know if you haven&amp;#39;t paid</text>
  <text start="57.239" dur="3.151">attention</text>
  <text start="58.68" dur="3.179">I ain&amp;#39;t am visiting Colonial</text>
  <text start="60.39" dur="4.559">Williamsburg I&amp;#39;ve been here all week I</text>
  <text start="61.859" dur="4.981">I&amp;#39;m typically in Juneau Alaska that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="4.17">where I operate out of but this week I</text>
  <text start="66.84" dur="5.58">came to Williamsburg I sort of as</text>
  <text start="69.119" dur="6.241">approach from pro-q tour of Kelowna</text>
  <text start="72.42" dur="4.17">looms vertical and it&amp;#39;s been amazing</text>
  <text start="75.36" dur="2.939">even though this was funded by</text>
  <text start="76.59" dur="5.37">rockefeller it&amp;#39;s a deep state</text>
  <text start="78.299" dur="6.061">Rockefeller yaw has used this place for</text>
  <text start="81.96" dur="4.53">his glory because I&amp;#39;ve talked about the</text>
  <text start="84.36" dur="4.14">June first fasting and prayer day that I</text>
  <text start="86.49" dur="4.559">learned that Thomas Jefferson and</text>
  <text start="88.5" dur="4.74">Patrick Henry launched which provided</text>
  <text start="91.049" dur="4.32">the impetus for the American Revolution</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="5.339">literally crying out to God they did</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="6.57">nine 1774 just before the war broke out</text>
  <text start="98.579" dur="4.801">in the following spring of 1775 so I</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="4.401">learned about that what were the other</text>
  <text start="103.38" dur="2.96">godly things we&amp;#39;ve learned</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="3.13">there&amp;#39;s been so much there&amp;#39;s just been</text>
  <text start="109.99" dur="2.85">so much</text>
  <text start="110.77" dur="4.709">oh we just came from the Presbyterians</text>
  <text start="112.84" dur="5.01">house which was basically in the first</text>
  <text start="115.479" dur="4.021">part of the 18th century like 1699 to</text>
  <text start="117.85" dur="4.559">the latter 1700s they had to get</text>
  <text start="119.5" dur="5.399">permission from Britain a license in</text>
  <text start="122.409" dur="6.24">order to open up a church which is</text>
  <text start="124.899" dur="5.28">absolutely ridiculous that&amp;#39;s you know in</text>
  <text start="128.649" dur="3.751">other words if I tried to preach here in</text>
  <text start="130.179" dur="4.021">the early 1700s I would have been</text>
  <text start="132.4" dur="3.54">arrested I would have been arrested here</text>
  <text start="134.2" dur="4.649">in Williamsburg because you&amp;#39;d have to</text>
  <text start="135.94" dur="5.37">have a license from Britain so this is</text>
  <text start="138.849" dur="5.22">another reason why they had to have the</text>
  <text start="141.31" dur="6.75">Revolutionary War now right there that</text>
  <text start="144.069" dur="7.051">is the rally Tavern when Britain</text>
  <text start="148.06" dur="4.56">dissolved the assembly that Patrick</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="4.38">Henry and Thomas Jefferson and all them</text>
  <text start="152.62" dur="5.67">were part of they met in secret here</text>
  <text start="155.5" dur="4.26">this was like the original cue they met</text>
  <text start="158.29" dur="3.15">in secret here and this is the</text>
  <text start="159.76" dur="3.96">birthplace of what would eventually</text>
  <text start="161.44" dur="3.84">become the Continental Congress just in</text>
  <text start="163.72" dur="3.51">this little tavern here and by the way</text>
  <text start="165.28" dur="3.45">when I say tavern I know people think oh</text>
  <text start="167.23" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s haver that must mean like a bar</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="3.42">room with where brawls break out no</text>
  <text start="170.59" dur="3.57">taverns in the 18th century were much</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="3.78">different they were they had they had</text>
  <text start="174.16" dur="3.35">ballrooms we actually toured one of</text>
  <text start="175.93" dur="4.619">these towers they had ballrooms they had</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="5.59">rooms of where you could sleep at they</text>
  <text start="180.549" dur="3.991">had a very actually tiny bar tiny tiny</text>
  <text start="183.1" dur="3.93">bar of liquor</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="5.87">they had rooms where the gentry would</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="5.519">smoke pipes so much different than a</text>
  <text start="190.41" dur="5.979">tavern we might think of our bar we</text>
  <text start="192.549" dur="6.78">might think of us today anyway that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="196.389" dur="4.771">where they met once they were dissolved</text>
  <text start="199.329" dur="3.78">sort of in rebellion to the British</text>
  <text start="201.16" dur="3.419">authorities so yeah and like people</text>
  <text start="203.109" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t realize that the First Amendment</text>
  <text start="204.579" dur="5.371">was passed because to protect open-air</text>
  <text start="208.389" dur="3.72">Street Preachers like George Whitefield</text>
  <text start="209.95" dur="3.75">John Wesley these open airy preachers</text>
  <text start="212.109" dur="3.571">like what I do you know when you saw me</text>
  <text start="213.7" dur="3.84">and Jared and Pam out in front of Oral</text>
  <text start="215.68" dur="4.44">Roberts University in Tulsa Oklahoma a</text>
  <text start="217.54" dur="3.569">couple weeks ago and we were opening our</text>
  <text start="220.12" dur="2.79">street preaching in front of their</text>
  <text start="221.109" dur="4.951">rebuking them okay that would have been</text>
  <text start="222.91" dur="5.37">illegal prior to the First Amendment&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.06" dur="3.84">passage so the First Amendment was</text>
  <text start="228.28" dur="3">passed largely to protect open-air</text>
  <text start="229.9" dur="3.75">Street Preachers to allow the free</text>
  <text start="231.28" dur="4.14">passage of the gospel the Messiah not to</text>
  <text start="233.65" dur="4.38">have to go to authority to get a license</text>
  <text start="235.42" dur="5.52">so that we can open a church or or do</text>
  <text start="238.03" dur="5.34">open-air preaching so this was the</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="6.24">in my mind this is the main reason that</text>
  <text start="243.37" dur="5.31">we needed the American Revolution so</text>
  <text start="247.18" dur="4.59">just a beautiful day it&amp;#39;s a bit colder</text>
  <text start="248.68" dur="4.65">today it&amp;#39;s clear but it&amp;#39;s cold even by</text>
  <text start="251.77" dur="2.64">Alaskan standards it&amp;#39;s pretty cold today</text>
  <text start="253.33" dur="3.39">because of that windchill that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="254.41" dur="5.76">really have to deal with in Alaska but</text>
  <text start="256.72" dur="6.51">just a beautiful day gorgeous snow</text>
