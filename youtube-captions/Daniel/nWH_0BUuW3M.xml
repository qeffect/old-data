  <text start="7.259" dur="6.271">Darren and this is part five of the</text>
  <text start="10.559" dur="5.191">Torah and the New Testament part 5 now I</text>
  <text start="13.53" dur="4.35">already have a podcast that I recorded</text>
  <text start="15.75" dur="4.92">several weeks ago back in December that</text>
  <text start="17.88" dur="4.649">gives a much more detailed and elaborate</text>
  <text start="20.67" dur="3.75">teaching on this part 5 but this is</text>
  <text start="22.529" dur="3.271">going to be more of a condensed sort of</text>
  <text start="24.42" dur="4.439">bite-sized teaching of it and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="25.8" dur="5.219">Galatians the book of Galatians now</text>
  <text start="28.859" dur="5.941">again I&amp;#39;m going to put a link underneath</text>
  <text start="31.019" dur="5.79">this video to the very you know five our</text>
  <text start="34.8" dur="4.89">skype session I recorded or whatever</text>
  <text start="36.809" dur="4.741">however long it was when i go through</text>
  <text start="39.69" dur="3.63">every single verse single asians we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="41.55" dur="3.12">not going to do that tonight but if you</text>
  <text start="43.32" dur="3.719">want to listen to that that will be a</text>
  <text start="44.67" dur="3.9">good supplement to this part 5 of the</text>
  <text start="47.039" dur="3.45">tour of the new testament but I&amp;#39;m at</text>
  <text start="48.57" dur="3.36">least going to explain the gist of the</text>
  <text start="50.489" dur="3.061">book of Galatians so that you can</text>
  <text start="51.93" dur="3.92">understand what Paul is dealing with in</text>
  <text start="53.55" dur="5.189">Galatians because so many Christians</text>
  <text start="55.85" dur="4.99">misunderstand Galatians they regulations</text>
  <text start="58.739" dur="4.111">and they think Oh Paul saying we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="60.84" dur="3.599">have to get circumcised we don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="3.51">keep Torah when I&amp;#39;m doing this stuff</text>
  <text start="64.439" dur="3.93">because hey that was the old way and now</text>
  <text start="66.36" dur="4.13">we&amp;#39;re saved by grace hallelujah and that</text>
  <text start="68.369" dur="6.331">is a completely and totally wrong</text>
  <text start="70.49" dur="7.449">reading of the book of Galatians so</text>
  <text start="74.7" dur="7.62">without further ado open up your Bibles</text>
  <text start="77.939" dur="7.581">to the book of Galatians the book of</text>
  <text start="82.32" dur="5.64">Galatians what was paul talking about</text>
  <text start="85.52" dur="5.26">remember when the Apostle Peter warned</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="5.909">us in second Peter 316 that there would</text>
  <text start="90.78" dur="4.89">be men unstable in the faith who would</text>
  <text start="93.869" dur="4.531">twist Paul&amp;#39;s words to their own</text>
  <text start="95.67" dur="5.64">destruction men unstable in the faith</text>
  <text start="98.4" dur="6.57">have twisted Galatians to destroy the</text>
  <text start="101.31" dur="5.91">true faith what is the true faith well</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="4.289">for that we got to go back to Romans 331</text>
  <text start="107.22" dur="5.85">where Apostle Paul very clearly defines</text>
  <text start="109.259" dur="6.831">what true saving faith is Romans 331</text>
  <text start="113.07" dur="7.17">declares that true faith makes firm or</text>
  <text start="116.09" dur="6.16">establishes the law the torah if anyone</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="4.83">uses Galatians to dissolve the Torah</text>
  <text start="122.25" dur="5.34">they are contradicting Romans 331 and</text>
  <text start="125.07" dur="5.309">thus are completely misunderstanding</text>
  <text start="127.59" dur="3.95">what Paul was trying to write and say to</text>
  <text start="130.379" dur="5.09">the Galatians</text>
  <text start="131.54" dur="5.88">so what was paul talking about in the</text>
  <text start="135.469" dur="3.961">very first chapter Galatians 1 Paul</text>
  <text start="137.42" dur="5.489">declares that he was at one time zealous</text>
  <text start="139.43" dur="6.949">of the traditions of the fathers the</text>
  <text start="142.909" dur="6.271">Jews this is in Galatians 1 verse 14</text>
  <text start="146.379" dur="7.121">notice Paul does not refer to the mosaic</text>
  <text start="149.18" dur="6.3">Torah but to the traditions of men for</text>
  <text start="153.5" dur="4.139">example such as not mixing meat and milk</text>
  <text start="155.48" dur="4.14">or having two kitchens or other absurd</text>
  <text start="157.639" dur="6.151">man-made rules that the rabbi&amp;#39;s had</text>
  <text start="159.62" dur="6.569">invented so again Paul&amp;#39;s main thesis in</text>
  <text start="163.79" dur="5.309">chapter one is he saying he was one</text>
  <text start="166.189" dur="5.94">zealous of the traditions of men did</text>
  <text start="169.099" dur="6.441">Torah come from men or did Torah come</text>
  <text start="172.129" dur="7.73">from Yahweh Torah came from Yahweh</text>
  <text start="175.54" dur="6.699">traditions come from men so Paul is</text>
  <text start="179.859" dur="4.391">dealing with traditions that came from</text>
  <text start="182.239" dur="5.761">men in the book of Galatians not the</text>
  <text start="184.25" dur="6.09">Torah in Galatians chapter 2 Paul brings</text>
  <text start="188" dur="5.04">up a specific example of when Peter</text>
  <text start="190.34" dur="6">compromised by falling back into vain</text>
  <text start="193.04" dur="5.279">Jewish traditions Peter refused to eat</text>
  <text start="196.34" dur="5.22">with believing Gentiles even though</text>
  <text start="198.319" dur="5.1">Torah is clear in Exodus chapter 12 that</text>
  <text start="201.56" dur="5.579">the tourists for both the Gentile and</text>
  <text start="203.419" dur="6">the Israelites the Jews in violation to</text>
  <text start="207.139" dur="4.621">the written Torah created a man-made</text>
  <text start="209.419" dur="5.611">rule that was rooted in bigotry and</text>
  <text start="211.76" dur="6.99">racism no Gentile could ever eat with</text>
  <text start="215.03" dur="5.819">them ever this man may tradition Yahshua</text>
  <text start="218.75" dur="3.78">constantly preached against and greatly</text>
  <text start="220.849" dur="3.121">offended the Pharisees because the</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="3.66">Pharisees were more concerned with their</text>
  <text start="223.97" dur="4.349">own man-made traditions than they were</text>
  <text start="226.19" dur="4.53">with actually keeping the written Torah</text>
  <text start="228.319" dur="6.151">and if you don&amp;#39;t believe me just read</text>
  <text start="230.72" dur="8.46">Matthew 23 23 over and over and over</text>
  <text start="234.47" dur="6.93">again Paul shows that Peter was wrong to</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="3.869">slip back into this vein oral traditions</text>
  <text start="241.4" dur="4.32">of the Jews because it violates the</text>
  <text start="243.049" dur="5.94">Torah and he&amp;#39;s being racist and bigoted</text>
  <text start="245.72" dur="5.609">toward the believing Gentiles the greek</text>
  <text start="248.989" dur="5.191">word for Nomos is translated into the</text>
  <text start="251.329" dur="6.03">english as law but nor most refers to</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="6.179">any system of regulations and rules the</text>
  <text start="257.359" dur="5.641">Torah is one such system the Talmud or</text>
  <text start="260.359" dur="4.03">man-made Jewish traditions is another</text>
  <text start="263" dur="3.969">such system</text>
  <text start="264.389" dur="4.951">thus the word law or no most has two</text>
  <text start="266.969" dur="3.931">different meanings sometimes when Paul</text>
  <text start="269.34" dur="4.379">refers to the law he is obviously</text>
  <text start="270.9" dur="4.53">referring to the Torah of Moses in</text>
  <text start="273.719" dur="3.871">Galatians every time he refers to the</text>
  <text start="275.43" dur="4.65">Torah he explains that the Torah was</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="4.74">never designed to justify anyone the</text>
  <text start="280.08" dur="5.639">Torah is something we obey as a result</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="5.1">of being justified by Yahshua and this</text>
  <text start="285.719" dur="3.75">was true even back in the days of Moses</text>
  <text start="287.43" dur="4.109">because remember they crossed through</text>
  <text start="289.469" dur="4.5">the Red Sea and were baptized and then</text>
  <text start="291.539" dur="4.021">they went to Mount Sinai and received</text>
  <text start="293.969" dur="3.81">the Torah they had to be baptized first</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;d be justified saved first from</text>
  <text start="297.779" dur="3.75">Egypt and then they were given the Torah</text>
  <text start="299.52" dur="4.709">just like it is today we got to be saved</text>
  <text start="301.529" dur="5.461">baptized Washington bloody Yahshua first</text>
  <text start="304.229" dur="4.8">and then we&amp;#39;re given the Holy Spirit so</text>
  <text start="306.99" dur="5.489">that we have the power than us to want</text>
  <text start="309.029" dur="5.85">to obey the Torah that power that only</text>
  <text start="312.479" dur="5.22">comes from Yahshua being seated on the</text>
  <text start="314.879" dur="4.201">throne of our hearts every time Paul</text>
  <text start="317.699" dur="3.84">were first and almost in the sense of</text>
  <text start="319.08" dur="5.16">the oral traditions the Talmud he calls</text>
  <text start="321.539" dur="5.49">them weak beggarly vain man-made and</text>
  <text start="324.24" dur="4.979">stupid in Galatians chapter three and</text>
  <text start="327.029" dur="4.831">four Paul says the Torah was once our</text>
  <text start="329.219" dur="4.891">schoolmaster at the beginning of chapter</text>
  <text start="331.86" dur="4.26">three he even used the uses the direct</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="5.669">analogy of a student being taught by</text>
  <text start="336.12" dur="5.819">tutors and governors but Paul makes the</text>
  <text start="339.779" dur="4.471">point when the child becomes a man he no</text>
  <text start="341.939" dur="6.6">longer needs those tutors and governors</text>
  <text start="344.25" dur="6.36">but why because that grown man now has</text>
  <text start="348.539" dur="4.68">learned what the tutors and governors</text>
  <text start="350.61" dur="4.41">had taught him what the child was taught</text>
  <text start="353.219" dur="3.81">was now deep within his mind and heart</text>
  <text start="355.02" dur="5.369">and now you go live what he had learned</text>
  <text start="357.029" dur="5.281">no longer needing instruction in the</text>
  <text start="360.389" dur="3.81">same way once we have grown up in our</text>
  <text start="362.31" dur="4.02">faith of yahushua we no longer need the</text>
  <text start="364.199" dur="4.64">tour to teach us how to live because by</text>
  <text start="366.33" dur="5.069">that point we should be living the torah</text>
  <text start="368.839" dur="5.05">we should not need any pasture to tell</text>
  <text start="371.399" dur="4.83">us when to rest on Shabbat or to wear</text>
  <text start="373.889" dur="4.14">blue fringes or to eat kosher we should</text>
  <text start="376.229" dur="4.381">know this and live like a father in the</text>
  <text start="378.029" dur="4.741">faith and eat kosher and where the blues</text>
  <text start="380.61" dur="4.459">easy and keep Shabbat from friday nights</text>
  <text start="382.77" dur="6.03">at night we should do this naturally</text>
  <text start="385.069" dur="5.56">because we&amp;#39;re now living the torah when</text>
  <text start="388.8" dur="4.169">you graduate from learning algebra and</text>
  <text start="390.629" dur="5.19">you start learning calculus you do not</text>
  <text start="392.969" dur="4.111">disregard the rules of algebra you use</text>
  <text start="395.819" dur="2.171">them but no longer need to be taught</text>
  <text start="397.08" dur="2.83">about them because</text>
  <text start="397.99" dur="3.27">have them deep in your mind and know how</text>
  <text start="399.91" dur="3.81">to practically use them with no</text>
  <text start="401.26" dur="4.05">instruction just as the grown man does</text>
  <text start="403.72" dur="3.48">not bring the disregard with the tutors</text>
  <text start="405.31" dur="4.7">tottenham but now practically lives it</text>
  <text start="407.2" dur="5.01">out so too we do not disregard Torah but</text>
  <text start="410.01" dur="6.58">practically live out the taurat because</text>
  <text start="412.21" dur="7.59">we love Yahshua Paul uses an allegory in</text>
  <text start="416.59" dur="6.39">Galatians chapter 4 about Hagar and her</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="5.51">son the bond man bond made and then the</text>
  <text start="422.98" dur="5.88">heavenly yerushalayim the seat of Isaac</text>
  <text start="425.31" dur="5.95">Abraham ignored faith in Yahweh when he</text>
  <text start="428.86" dur="4.62">procreated with Hagar his handmaiden to</text>
  <text start="431.26" dur="4.14">try and bring about the promise just</text>
  <text start="433.48" dur="3.6">like the Pharisees disregarded faith a</text>
  <text start="435.4" dur="5.31">pillar of Toren created their fleshly</text>
  <text start="437.08" dur="5.82">oral traditions however later Abraham</text>
  <text start="440.71" dur="5.31">trusted in yah when he procreated with</text>
  <text start="442.9" dur="4.8">his wife Sarah and created Isaac just as</text>
  <text start="446.02" dur="5.91">when we trust in yah by keeping Torah</text>
  <text start="447.7" dur="6.33">due to our love for him in Galatians 4</text>
  <text start="451.93" dur="4.29">and 5 we learned that those believing</text>
  <text start="454.03" dur="4.77">Jews who want to force converts to keep</text>
  <text start="456.22" dur="4.23">the jewish talmud and customs are doing</text>
  <text start="458.8" dur="5.28">so because they do not want to offend</text>
  <text start="460.45" dur="6.08">the non-believing jews but then the</text>
  <text start="464.08" dur="4.68">offense of the tree the cross is ceased</text>
  <text start="466.53" dur="3.67">Yahshua offended against the oral</text>
  <text start="468.76" dur="3.03">traditions by continuing to preach</text>
  <text start="470.2" dur="3.63">against them for many of those</text>
  <text start="471.79" dur="4.17">traditions not all of them but many of</text>
  <text start="473.83" dur="5.49">the jewish traditions nullified and</text>
  <text start="475.96" dur="5.28">opposed the Torah and I&amp;#39;ve given</text>
  <text start="479.32" dur="3.36">examples of this such as they had a</text>
  <text start="481.24" dur="3.3">tradition in the first century that if</text>
  <text start="482.68" dur="4.11">you paid gold of the temple called it</text>
  <text start="484.54" dur="3.93">corbon you you could basically curse</text>
  <text start="486.79" dur="3.09">your parents all you wanted because as</text>
  <text start="488.47" dur="3.15">long as you paid that goal at the temple</text>
  <text start="489.88" dur="4.05">hey you&amp;#39;re good you&amp;#39;ve honored your</text>
  <text start="491.62" dur="4.2">parents and that of course opposed a</text>
  <text start="493.93" dur="3.96">direct commandment in torah thou shalt</text>
  <text start="495.82" dur="4.83">honor your mother and your father so the</text>
  <text start="497.89" dur="4.35">vein traditions of the rabbi&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="3.69">first century we&amp;#39;re actually nullifying</text>
  <text start="502.24" dur="3.96">and opposing the written Torah this is</text>
  <text start="504.34" dur="5.73">what Yahshua pose this is what Paul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.2" dur="5.52">opposing in the book of Galatians but</text>
