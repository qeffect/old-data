  <text start="265.02" dur="4.86">special testimony that I want to share</text>
  <text start="267.45" dur="5.25">so I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if I was supposed to go</text>

  <text start="272.7" dur="4.5">know it&amp;#39;s it was an hour drive out to</text>
  <text start="274.32" dur="4.2">Anchorage and I don&amp;#39;t I wondered if I</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="4.02">should just spend more time in nature</text>
  <text start="278.52" dur="5.82">because I so enjoyed that nature</text>
  <text start="281.22" dur="6.03">conservatory that I went to yesterday</text>
  <text start="284.34" dur="4.74">with all the animals but I I did go up</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="3.87">there cuz I felt like yeah I just wanted</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="5.55">me to go there and literally right after</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="6.21">I filmed that menorah that I saw in the</text>
  <text start="294.63" dur="5.43">Native American exhibit there this man</text>
  <text start="297.33" dur="4.56">walked up to me and we wound up speaking</text>
  <text start="300.06" dur="3.99">a couple of times throughout my stay at</text>
  <text start="301.89" dur="3.96">the museum in fact we all told we</text>
  <text start="304.05" dur="5.489">probably spoke at least 20-30 minutes</text>
  <text start="305.85" dur="5.49">just him a nice chatting and he was</text>
  <text start="309.539" dur="4.021">asking me about what I was talking about</text>
  <text start="311.34" dur="3.84">and so I started sharing with him my</text>
  <text start="313.56" dur="3.75">testimony the ministry that he always</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="5.46">given me how what I do in exposing</text>
  <text start="317.31" dur="5.16">pedophiles and he shared with me that he</text>
  <text start="320.64" dur="4.709">had actually been called to Alaska as</text>
  <text start="322.47" dur="3.33">well he had been working for his dad&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.349" dur="2.79">come</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="3.989">in the Samoan Islands and he literally</text>
  <text start="328.139" dur="3.391">gave all that up I mean he was making a</text>
  <text start="329.789" dur="3.271">ton of money he gave all that up to come</text>
  <text start="331.53" dur="4.319">out to Anchorage to serve as a youth</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="5.639">minister at a local church and so we</text>
  <text start="335.849" dur="4.831">just we just began talking and I share</text>
  <text start="338.699" dur="4.021">with them how yah had brought me up to</text>
  <text start="340.68" dur="4.109">Alaska and why he had done so and then</text>
  <text start="342.72" dur="4.169">what had happened with this ministry I</text>
  <text start="344.789" dur="4.231">had and so he was like oh so he wrote</text>
  <text start="346.889" dur="4.02">down my website he wrote down my name he</text>
  <text start="349.02" dur="4.079">wanted to learn more about the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="350.909" dur="4.021">Jewish roots of the of the Christian</text>
  <text start="353.099" dur="4.111">faith and it was just it was a very</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="5.01">edifying time so after we were done</text>
  <text start="357.21" dur="5.28">talking I was like okay I get it I was</text>
  <text start="359.94" dur="4.349">supposed to come to the museum so so</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="4.829">that was really beautiful I found out</text>
  <text start="364.289" dur="4.711">that Alaska was actually founded in 1867</text>
  <text start="367.319" dur="4.681">which would have been a Jubilee year</text>
  <text start="369" dur="5.639">that&amp;#39;s when it became an actual state of</text>
  <text start="372" dur="6.509">the United States was in 1867 remember</text>
  <text start="374.639" dur="6.481">the Jubilee years is 67 1767 17 that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="378.509" dur="3.84">how they work I had a video earlier if</text>
  <text start="381.12" dur="4.799">you haven&amp;#39;t seen it that I made a couple</text>
  <text start="382.349" dur="4.861">Shabbat segoe called or actually was on</text>
  <text start="385.919" dur="4.11">the Feast of Trumpets so it&amp;#39;s on a high</text>
  <text start="387.21" dur="4.829">Shabbat but the video is called prophecy</text>
  <text start="390.029" dur="4.44">pedophiles and Trump x marks the spot</text>
  <text start="392.039" dur="4.111">and I talked about the Jubilee year how</text>
  <text start="394.469" dur="4.17">it happens every 50 years and how it</text>
  <text start="396.15" dur="5.009">happened in 1917 and I give the reasons</text>
  <text start="398.639" dur="3.691">why and then how it happened in 1967 and</text>
  <text start="401.159" dur="3.451">I give the reasons why and then how I</text>
  <text start="402.33" dur="4.079">have been in 2017 and how that that</text>
  <text start="404.61" dur="2.94">Jubilee year was directly tied to</text>
  <text start="406.409" dur="4.26">President Trump</text>
  <text start="407.55" dur="6">well 1867 would have been the Jubilee</text>
  <text start="410.669" dur="5.97">year before 1917 and so it was cool that</text>
  <text start="413.55" dur="4.29">Alaska&amp;#39;s was actually became a state in</text>
  <text start="416.639" dur="2.851">that year so I thought that was really</text>
  <text start="417.84" dur="3.299">neat a lot of just neat things that I</text>
  <text start="419.49" dur="4.38">learned at the museum that I just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="421.139" dur="4.321">know about Alaska and its history some</text>
  <text start="423.87" dur="3.21">gorgeous paintings if you ever get a</text>
  <text start="425.46" dur="4.459">chance to go it&amp;#39;s a very very neat place</text>
  <text start="427.08" dur="5.91">and by the way the airport in Anchorage</text>
  <text start="429.919" dur="5.891">beautiful it&amp;#39;s like a museum I mean you</text>
  <text start="432.99" dur="5.789">got these stone rock walls</text>
  <text start="435.81" dur="5.88">you got these pin lit artifacts that are</text>
  <text start="438.779" dur="4.92">that are in these beautiful wooden</text>
  <text start="441.69" dur="3.569">corridors it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s the most</text>
  <text start="443.699" dur="4.141">beautiful airport I&amp;#39;ve ever seen it</text>
  <text start="445.259" dur="3.991">gorgeous paintings of the mountains it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.84" dur="2.819">incredible and there&amp;#39;s hardly anyone</text>
  <text start="449.25" dur="4.259">there because there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="450.659" dur="4.111">that many people in Anchorage in fact I</text>
  <text start="453.509" dur="4.111">talked to the airport they said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.77" dur="5.55">mostly used for it&amp;#39;s like a hub for</text>
  <text start="457.62" dur="3.6">goods like transportation so not a lot</text>
  <text start="460.32" dur="2.55">of people that go through the airport</text>
  <text start="461.22" dur="3.42">but a lot of goods and things like that</text>
  <text start="462.87" dur="2.18">go through the airport so hope that was</text>
  <text start="464.64" dur="3.51">interesting</text>
  <text start="465.05" dur="5.62">anyway I really just blessed by that</text>
  <text start="468.15" dur="3.75">testimony and then of course I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="470.67" dur="3.78">know if I was gonna go on the helicopter</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="4.5">ride because you have to have more than</text>
  <text start="474.45" dur="3.87">one person go up that they won&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="476.4" dur="3.78">you and I you know I could only afford</text>
  <text start="478.32" dur="3.18">one seat I could only afford for myself</text>
  <text start="480.18" dur="3.42">and of course I don&amp;#39;t have anyone that I</text>
  <text start="481.5" dur="3.42">came with and so I was just praying well</text>
  <text start="483.6" dur="3.72">yeah if you want me to do it you&amp;#39;ll open</text>
  <text start="484.92" dur="4.35">the door and literally just before</text>
  <text start="487.32" dur="4.11">Shabbat began like three hours before</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="3.6">Shabbat they&amp;#39;re like well we can take</text>
  <text start="491.43" dur="3.33">you up for a half hour there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="494.76" dur="3.42">San Francisco and you know really wants</text>
  <text start="496.35" dur="4.56">to go but but we can take you both up</text>
  <text start="498.18" dur="4.74">and I was like oh wow so literally like</text>
  <text start="500.91" dur="3.78">three hours before Shabbat began I got</text>
  <text start="502.92" dur="3.66">to I got to go on this helicopter ride</text>
  <text start="504.69" dur="4.44">and I was like oh this is gonna be such</text>
  <text start="506.58" dur="4.47">a blessing for for everyone to see so</text>
  <text start="509.13" dur="3.6">that really made me happy and then I</text>
  <text start="511.05" dur="3.15">came home and my internet was completely</text>
  <text start="512.73" dur="3.12">down like just completely shut down</text>
  <text start="514.2" dur="3.99">couldn&amp;#39;t get on the internet at all and</text>
  <text start="515.85" dur="4.71">I called brother Vic all right texted</text>
  <text start="518.19" dur="4.26">Vic and he prayed and like within five</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="3.84">minutes after he prayed I got the idea</text>
  <text start="522.45" dur="4.74">hey I can just use the hotspot on my</text>
  <text start="524.4" dur="3.99">cell phone and create a hotspot so for</text>
  <text start="527.19" dur="3.15">some reason the internet went down here</text>
  <text start="528.39" dur="4.34">at the air B&amp;amp;B I don&amp;#39;t know why it looks</text>
  <text start="530.34" dur="4.05">like the entire city of Girdwood is down</text>
  <text start="532.73" dur="3.49">because I tried going over the</text>
  <text start="534.39" dur="3.69">laundromat before Shabbat and it</text>
  <text start="536.22" dur="3.54">wouldn&amp;#39;t work either so just sharing the</text>
