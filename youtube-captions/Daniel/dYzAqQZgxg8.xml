  <text start="156.7" dur="9.259">saqqaq this is an eight-sided</text>
  <text start="159.209" dur="10.45">structure here one two three and four</text>
  <text start="165.959" dur="7.95">and then on the other side one two three</text>
  <text start="169.659" dur="4.25">four eight and then there&amp;#39;s the this</text>
  <text start="174.239" dur="8.08">there&amp;#39;s ten total but there&amp;#39;s eight</text>
  <text start="179.26" dur="9.629">sides there&amp;#39;s an opening in front the</text>
  <text start="182.319" dur="11.211">back cool actually an octagonal eight</text>
  <text start="188.889" dur="10.77">sided place for the eight days of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="193.53" dur="9.039">the beautiful part we&amp;#39;re about to get to</text>
  <text start="199.659" dur="7.53">the sixth bridge the Philadelphian</text>
  <text start="202.569" dur="7.881">bridge but I just had it filmless park</text>
  <text start="207.189" dur="3.261">first because it&amp;#39;s just so beautiful</text>
  <text start="212.629" dur="6.75">takes place this is uh tucked away</text>
  <text start="216.079" dur="7.701">behind sweet home Oregon which I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="219.379" dur="6.45">even know there was a sweet home Oregon</text>
  <text start="223.78" dur="5.14">it&amp;#39;s like a totally different world from</text>
  <text start="225.829" dur="8.78">Portland I feel like I&amp;#39;m either back in</text>
  <text start="228.92" dur="5.689">time or in rural Missouri like in Ozarks</text>
  <text start="237.28" dur="13.06">there&amp;#39;s the sixth Ridge little bridge I</text>
  <text start="248.409" dur="10.211">wonder if this is like a picture of the</text>
  <text start="250.34" dur="11.699">safe place woman&amp;#39;s gonna be in a safe</text>
  <text start="258.62" dur="5.15">place for 1260 days and it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="262.039" dur="4.291">like a sweet home on earth</text>
  <text start="263.77" dur="3.04">we&amp;#39;re in Revelation 12 we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="2.88">nourished</text>
  <text start="266.81" dur="3.889">I don&amp;#39;t know insight about that by the</text>
  <text start="269.21" dur="6.69">way because it says in Revelation 12</text>
  <text start="270.699" dur="7.06">this woman will get be given wings of an</text>
  <text start="275.9" dur="3.72">eagle and brought to the safe place for</text>
  <text start="277.759" dur="4.051">1260 days or three and a half years</text>
  <text start="279.62" dur="5.88">while the antichrist is doing his thing</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="6.12">on the earth and it says they will</text>
  <text start="285.5" dur="4.05">nourish them and I thought hey who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.93" dur="2.579">they because Yahshua hasn&amp;#39;t returned yet</text>
  <text start="289.55" dur="2.1">you&amp;#39;re not gonna return until the</text>
  <text start="290.509" dur="3.541">resurrection which is three-and-a-half</text>
  <text start="291.65" dur="4.049">years later I thought it was Angel&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.05" dur="5.549">because if you remember remember when</text>
  <text start="295.699" dur="6.81">Yahshua was tempted Yahshua was tempted</text>
  <text start="299.599" dur="5.31">in the wilderness by Satan for 40 days</text>
  <text start="302.509" dur="4.891">and 40 nights and after that temptation</text>
  <text start="304.909" dur="4.161">Satan left him for a season and it says</text>
  <text start="307.4" dur="3.84">angels came and what do they do they</text>
  <text start="309.07" dur="2.5">ministered India Schwar they nourished</text>
  <text start="311.24" dur="2.85">him</text>
  <text start="311.57" dur="4.409">they nourished him so I thought well</text>
  <text start="314.09" dur="3.75">just as the end angels nourished Yahshua</text>
  <text start="315.979" dur="6.601">after he resisted the satanic temptation</text>
  <text start="317.84" dur="7.5">that will be nourished by angels in the</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="3.99">safe place or maybe it&amp;#39;ll just be a you</text>
  <text start="325.34" dur="4.47">know the latter reign of just an</text>
  <text start="326.57" dur="5.339">increase of his holy spirit nourishing</text>
  <text start="329.81" dur="3.599">us I don&amp;#39;t know I know it&amp;#39;s not gonna be</text>
  <text start="331.909" dur="3.031">a bodily form of Yahshua or like some of</text>
  <text start="333.409" dur="4.111">these stupid greater Exodus people are</text>
  <text start="334.94" dur="4.349">teaching because you&amp;#39;re all warned</text>
  <text start="337.52" dur="3.959">against that and said if someone says</text>
  <text start="339.289" dur="3.331">I&amp;#39;m in the desert or in the closet or in</text>
  <text start="341.479" dur="3.66">the secret chambers don&amp;#39;t believe them</text>
  <text start="342.62" dur="4.51">as lightning comes from east of the West</text>
  <text start="345.139" dur="5.121">so shall I</text>
  <text start="347.13" dur="5.47">we&amp;#39;re not gonna see Yahshua you know</text>
  <text start="350.26" dur="4.409">like wait Jochen on saw y&amp;#39;all show and</text>
  <text start="352.6" dur="3.36">that Booker ever gonna see him until we</text>
  <text start="354.669" dur="4.22">actually get caught up to be with him in</text>
  <text start="355.96" dur="5.01">the clouds that&amp;#39;s a literal thing but</text>
  <text start="358.889" dur="3.401">but I think it&amp;#39;s gonna be angels who</text>
  <text start="360.97" dur="2.91">will probably minister to us in the safe</text>
  <text start="362.29" dur="5.99">place or just an increase of his Holy</text>
  <text start="363.88" dur="6.569">Spirit so here we are on Weddell bridge</text>
  <text start="368.28" dur="4.389">this bridge actually was in a different</text>
  <text start="370.449" dur="5.851">location originally and it burned down</text>
  <text start="372.669" dur="5.461">and they had to restore it and put it in</text>
  <text start="376.3" dur="4.8">a different location so the day he was</text>
  <text start="378.13" dur="4.23">actually 1990 kind of funny and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="381.1" dur="3.12">doing some restoration today it looks</text>
  <text start="382.36" dur="7.23">like on the bridge itself and on the</text>
  <text start="384.22" dur="8.97">park grounds not really much of a river</text>
  <text start="389.59" dur="6.23">is just a little trickle in fact the</text>
  <text start="393.19" dur="2.63">rivers pretty much</text>
  <text start="414.85" dur="7.71">I&amp;#39;m sort of athletic field it looks like</text>
  <text start="418.99" dur="3.57">baseball I would say</text>
  <text start="432.07" dur="6.92">Ames Creek</text>
  <text start="434.98" dur="4.01">at the correct a mature in Philadelphia</text>
  <text start="440.22" dur="4.47">and there&amp;#39;s a sweet home Arkansas</text>
  <text start="459.81" dur="3.62">look at that there&amp;#39;s a little tiny</text>
  <text start="512.14" dur="6.54">maybe this is how I is restoring</text>
  <text start="514.98" dur="7.03">preparing Philadelphia have a picture of</text>
  <text start="518.68" dur="6.75">that those arrived to see energy gear</text>
  <text start="522.01" dur="6.45">here if the spirit says unto the</text>
  <text start="525.43" dur="5.99">Assembly of Philadelphia well we can</text>
  <text start="528.46" dur="2.96">actually go under this bridge</text>
  <text start="553.88" dur="5.04">so by the way I guess I&amp;#39;ll take this</text>
  <text start="556.28" dur="6.54">opportunity to say for those of you</text>
  <text start="558.92" dur="7.35">didn&amp;#39;t get bored or still watching so</text>
  <text start="562.82" dur="8.54">many years ago back I would say in 2002</text>
  <text start="566.27" dur="9.24">- mm mmm I want to say until 2009 or so</text>
  <text start="571.36" dur="5.59">2008 I had a conviction that not only</text>
  <text start="575.51" dur="3.15">would you take the Shabbat off from work</text>
  <text start="576.95" dur="2.64">of course you take the weekly Shabbat</text>
  <text start="578.66" dur="2.01">from Friday night Saturday night but</text>
  <text start="579.59" dur="4.32">outside of conviction that you take the</text>
  <text start="580.67" dur="6.09">New Moon&amp;#39;s off and around 2008-2009 they</text>
  <text start="583.91" dur="4.83">changed that because I discovered an</text>
  <text start="586.76" dur="3.45">exodus that they you know they reared up</text>
  <text start="588.74" dur="2.94">the tabernacle on the first day of the</text>
  <text start="590.21" dur="3.36">first month which she would never do on</text>
  <text start="591.68" dur="5.55">a Shabbat because that&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="593.57" dur="6">intensive work and I just thought well</text>
  <text start="597.23" dur="4.44">why would ya so Phi on the 7th new moon</text>
  <text start="599.57" dur="4.08">yom teruah the Feast of Trumpets to not</text>
  <text start="601.67" dur="4.5">work if every new moon was a Shabbat</text>
  <text start="603.65" dur="4.74">anyway but I was I was recently</text>
  <text start="606.17" dur="4.43">convicted again about that passage in</text>
  <text start="608.39" dur="5.49">Amos I think it&amp;#39;s a mr. 8 where it says</text>
  <text start="610.6" dur="5.98">the wicked backslidden Israelites and</text>
  <text start="613.88" dur="4.11">Jews couldn&amp;#39;t wait for the new moon and</text>
  <text start="616.58" dur="2.67">Shabbat to be over so they could buy and</text>
  <text start="617.99" dur="3.09">sell and I always thought well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="619.25" dur="4.02">must be referring to the the 7th new</text>
  <text start="621.08" dur="3.99">moon but try as I might as I&amp;#39;m reading</text>
  <text start="623.27" dur="3.93">that scripture I can&amp;#39;t find where it</text>
  <text start="625.07" dur="3.54">actually specifies the 7th new moon it</text>
  <text start="627.2" dur="3.18">just says they can&amp;#39;t wait for the</text>
  <text start="628.61" dur="5.19">Shabbat or the new moon to be over so</text>
  <text start="630.38" dur="4.65">they can buy and sell so while I still</text>
  <text start="633.8" dur="5.18">think the New Moon is definitely</text>
  <text start="635.03" dur="6.24">distinct and different from Shabbat I</text>
  <text start="638.98" dur="4.6">think what I&amp;#39;m gonna do start doing now</text>
  <text start="641.27" dur="4.38">is I&amp;#39;m gonna actually request the</text>
  <text start="643.58" dur="3.45">monthly New Moon&amp;#39;s off from work and not</text>
  <text start="645.65" dur="4.05">work on new moons anymore and instead</text>
  <text start="647.03" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;m gonna use the monthly new moon to do</text>
  <text start="649.7" dur="3.27">street preaching because street</text>
  <text start="651.17" dur="4.05">preaching when you do street preaching</text>
  <text start="652.97" dur="5.61">it it&amp;#39;s like doing an athletic a full</text>
  <text start="655.22" dur="5.4">athletic like decathlon when you preach</text>
  <text start="658.58" dur="3.54">for two three hours five six hours it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="660.62" dur="2.76">like your drink is it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="662.12" dur="3.36">physical but it&amp;#39;s spiritual you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="663.38" dur="3.33">battling people who are mocking you and</text>
  <text start="665.48" dur="2.61">making fun of you and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s draining</text>
  <text start="666.71" dur="3.33">and it&amp;#39;s not really something you want</text>
  <text start="668.09" dur="4.05">to do on Shabbat in fact Yahshua on</text>
  <text start="670.04" dur="3.81">Shabbat he would heal people he would</text>
  <text start="672.14" dur="4.14">teach in the synagogue&amp;#39;s he would you</text>
  <text start="673.85" dur="3.9">know have these sort of nice little</text>
  <text start="676.28" dur="3.45">laid-back sessions but he wasn&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="677.75" dur="3.63">hard shree preaching on Shabbat he</text>
  <text start="679.73" dur="3.78">wouldn&amp;#39;t do that and I don&amp;#39;t think Paul</text>
  <text start="681.38" dur="4.05">or the early Jewish apostles were</text>
  <text start="683.51" dur="3.95">probably doing the intense street</text>
  <text start="685.43" dur="4.52">preaching like on Marcel on Shabbat</text>
  <text start="687.46" dur="3.96">because I was trying to do preaching on</text>
  <text start="689.95" dur="3.87">Shabbat slasher and it just drained me</text>
  <text start="691.42" dur="4.05">so I think I&amp;#39;ll start taking New Moon&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="693.82" dur="4.11">off but I&amp;#39;m gonna reserve New Moon&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="695.47" dur="5.73">do street preaching and evangelism once</text>
  <text start="697.93" dur="4.62">a month and you know because I have so</text>
  <text start="701.2" dur="3.21">much favor at work I couldn&amp;#39;t easily</text>
  <text start="702.55" dur="4.05">take the the monthly New Moon&amp;#39;s off that</text>
  <text start="704.41" dur="5.16">way I&amp;#39;ll have a weekly festival the</text>
  <text start="706.6" dur="5.85">Shabbat a monthly festival the New Moon</text>
  <text start="709.57" dur="5.85">and then the yearly annual feasts</text>
  <text start="712.45" dur="6.39">including beyond the seven the Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="715.42" dur="4.68">and Purim as well so oh yeah so I just</text>
  <text start="718.84" dur="3.92">thought I&amp;#39;d let everyone I think I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="720.1" dur="4.89">gonna start taking New Moon&amp;#39;s off</text>
  <text start="722.76" dur="3.25">because they&amp;#39;re definitely the other</text>
  <text start="724.99" dur="4.65">thing that convicted me was I was</text>
  <text start="726.01" dur="5.13">reading in Isaiah 66 and it says that in</text>
  <text start="729.64" dur="3.78">the new heavens and new earth so this is</text>
  <text start="731.14" dur="3.96">even beyond the Millennium it says all</text>
  <text start="733.42" dur="3.27">flesh will come before him from one</text>
  <text start="735.1" dur="2.28">Shabbat to another and from one new moon</text>
  <text start="736.69" dur="2.7">to another</text>
  <text start="737.38" dur="3.3">well if even in the new heavens and new</text>
  <text start="739.39" dur="3.54">earth we&amp;#39;re gonna be coming before his</text>
  <text start="740.68" dur="3.63">throne to worship Him from one Shabbat</text>
  <text start="742.93" dur="3.57">to another and from one new moon to</text>
  <text start="744.31" dur="4.37">another that convicts me that New Moon&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="746.5" dur="5.49">ought to be times that we set aside</text>
  <text start="748.68" dur="4.63">every new moon not just the seventh so</text>
  <text start="751.99" dur="3.93">I&amp;#39;m gonna start setting aside those New</text>
  <text start="753.31" dur="7.56">Moon&amp;#39;s and treating it sort of as a</text>
  <text start="755.92" dur="6.32">Shabbat basically a special day and</text>
  <text start="760.87" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s my conviction that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="762.24" dur="6.16">returning to after departing from it for</text>
  <text start="764.86" dur="5.19">many many years and honestly I think</text>
  <text start="768.4" dur="3.74">probably the reason I departed from it</text>
  <text start="770.05" dur="4.38">was I didn&amp;#39;t have the faith to say I</text>
  <text start="772.14" dur="4.57">mean I had the faith to keep the weekly</text>
  <text start="774.43" dur="4.11">Shabbat sin the yearly high Sabbath&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="776.71" dur="3.48">but I didn&amp;#39;t have the faith to take the</text>
  <text start="778.54" dur="3.33">monthly New Moon&amp;#39;s because you know new</text>
  <text start="780.19" dur="4.53">moon days happened different on a</text>
  <text start="781.87" dur="4.29">different day every month but I think I</text>
  <text start="784.72" dur="2.67">have the faith to do it and I certainly</text>
  <text start="786.16" dur="3.15">have the favour to do I&amp;#39;ll have an</text>
  <text start="787.39" dur="4.35">excuse not to do it I mean my vows won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="789.31" dur="5.4">have a problem with me doing it so I</text>
  <text start="791.74" dur="5.82">think that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m gonna do start</text>
  <text start="794.71" dur="4.44">keeping these New Moon&amp;#39;s and just devote</text>
  <text start="797.56" dur="5.91">those days to evangelism to street</text>
  <text start="799.15" dur="5.91">preaching so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="803.47" dur="3.63">gonna do</text>
  <text start="805.06" dur="4.4">and I think the scripture in the spirit</text>
  <text start="807.1" dur="4.89">has been confirming that as I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="809.46" dur="5.98">seeking him during these first two days</text>
  <text start="811.99" dur="4.56">of Sukkot I just feel and I&amp;#39;ll probably</text>
  <text start="815.44" dur="3.5">write an article or make a video</text>
  <text start="816.55" dur="4.71">specifically about the new moon again</text>
  <text start="818.94" dur="4.54">but I think I&amp;#39;m gonna return to taking</text>
  <text start="821.26" dur="5.94">the new moons off not just the seventh</text>
  <text start="823.48" dur="5.1">new moon but all twelve or thirteen new</text>
  <text start="827.2" dur="4.44">moons because sometimes we have an eight</text>
  <text start="828.58" dur="4.92">hour bet because of the way the earth</text>
  <text start="831.64" dur="4.05">has been messed up it&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="833.5" dur="4.53">restored back to a twelve month year</text>
  <text start="835.69" dur="4.86">consistently until we get to the new</text>
  <text start="838.03" dur="3.6">heavens and new earth even though and</text>
  <text start="840.55" dur="4.77">then the Millennium will still have</text>
  <text start="841.63" dur="8.57">eight our bets will be night and day all</text>
  <text start="845.32" dur="4.88">right so this is the sixth bridge</text>
  <text start="852.75" dur="3.379">go to this footbridge</text>
  <text start="858.13" dur="10.56">it&amp;#39;s Philadelphian spots</text>
  <text start="860.77" dur="9.92">looking at walk comes over there well I</text>
  <text start="868.69" dur="4.32">got to really figure out how to do the</text>
  <text start="870.69" dur="5.41">focus on this iPad it&amp;#39;s just not working</text>
  <text start="873.01" dur="4.8">right my zoom in it the focus just</text>
