  <text start="12.66" dur="5.25">hebrew month and I I know I&amp;#39;ve made a</text>
  <text start="15.389" dur="4.201">YouTube about this topic before maybe a</text>
  <text start="17.91" dur="5.16">couple youtubes but I&amp;#39;ve been getting</text>
  <text start="19.59" dur="5.189">emails through the web and on my youtube</text>
  <text start="23.07" dur="4.89">channel and things again about this</text>
  <text start="24.779" dur="5.07">topic where people are saying things</text>
  <text start="27.96" dur="4.56">like well Daniel there&amp;#39;s no way we can</text>
  <text start="29.849" dur="4.441">possibly keep God&amp;#39;s law there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="32.52" dur="3.48">we can keep the commandments and Torah</text>
  <text start="34.29" dur="4.05">there&amp;#39;s no way we can obey the Bible</text>
  <text start="36" dur="4.86">after all that&amp;#39;s why Jesus died and rose</text>
  <text start="38.34" dur="5.489">again so the you know he did that for us</text>
  <text start="40.86" dur="7.71">and we don&amp;#39;t have to do it and again</text>
  <text start="43.829" dur="7.591">that that notion that myth is completely</text>
  <text start="48.57" dur="4.879">antithetical to what the Bible says and</text>
  <text start="51.42" dur="5.88">I&amp;#39;m just going to go through some</text>
  <text start="53.449" dur="5.531">scriptures here to prove that first one</text>
  <text start="57.3" dur="5.54">I want to go to is in Deuteronomy</text>
  <text start="58.98" dur="7.889">chapter 30 starting in verse 10</text>
  <text start="62.84" dur="6.76">Deuteronomy 30 verse 10 it says if thou</text>
  <text start="66.869" dur="6.721">shalt hearken unto the voice of Yahweh</text>
  <text start="69.6" dur="7.05">your Elohim to keep his commandments and</text>
  <text start="73.59" dur="6.389">his statutes which are written in this</text>
  <text start="76.65" dur="8.91">book referring to Deuteronomy referring</text>
  <text start="79.979" dur="7.591">to the Torah of the law and if thou turn</text>
  <text start="85.56" dur="4.8">unto yahweh are looking with all your</text>
  <text start="87.57" dur="4.53">heart and with all your soul for this</text>
  <text start="90.36" dur="5.969">commandment which I command you this day</text>
  <text start="92.1" dur="6.96">is not hidden from you neither is it far</text>
  <text start="96.329" dur="4.771">off it is not in heaven that you should</text>
  <text start="99.06" dur="4.83">say who shall go up for us to heaven and</text>
  <text start="101.1" dur="6.21">bring it unto us that we may hear it and</text>
  <text start="103.89" dur="5.49">do it neither is it beyond the sea that</text>
  <text start="107.31" dur="3.96">you should say who shall go over the sea</text>
  <text start="109.38" dur="4.739">for us and bring it unto us that we may</text>
  <text start="111.27" dur="4.919">hear it and do it but the word is very</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="7.561">near unto you in your mouth and in your</text>
  <text start="116.189" dur="7.051">heart that you may do it then it goes on</text>
  <text start="121.68" dur="4.979">to say see I&amp;#39;ve set before you this day</text>
  <text start="123.24" dur="5.159">life and death life and good death and</text>
  <text start="126.659" dur="3.66">evil</text>
  <text start="128.399" dur="3.961">and then I command you is they love yah</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="4.681">way to walk in his ways to keep his camp</text>
  <text start="132.36" dur="5.28">to do his statutes so it&amp;#39;s very clear</text>
  <text start="135" dur="4.319">here they are saying to his people is</text>
  <text start="137.64" dur="3.599">saying look though don&amp;#39;t make this</text>
  <text start="139.319" dur="4.23">excuse that my Commandments are too hard</text>
  <text start="141.239" dur="4.231">don&amp;#39;t say their way up in heaven who</text>
  <text start="143.549" dur="3.631">will go up and bring it down to us or</text>
  <text start="145.47" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s way over to see who will cross the</text>
  <text start="147.18" dur="5.25">ocean to bring know you can do these</text>
  <text start="149.67" dur="6.39">Commandments so that&amp;#39;s my big example</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="6.059">from jharana me 30 of course if you go</text>
  <text start="156.06" dur="4.92">to the longest Psalm in the Bible psalm</text>
  <text start="158.489" dur="7.951">119 written by King David who is a man</text>
  <text start="160.98" dur="8.46">after you always own heart that Psalm is</text>
  <text start="166.44" dur="5.46">filled with statements of keeping Yas</text>
  <text start="169.44" dur="4.59">Commandments the very first verse</text>
  <text start="171.9" dur="5.19">molested are the undefiled in the way</text>
  <text start="174.03" dur="5.609">who walked in the law of the Lord in the</text>
  <text start="177.09" dur="4.289">Torah of Yahweh okay so if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="179.639" dur="4.85">impossible to do his commandments why</text>
  <text start="181.379" dur="5.01">would it say blessed are those who do it</text>
  <text start="184.489" dur="3.61">blessed are they who keep his</text>
  <text start="186.389" dur="4.891">testimonies at seek him with a whole</text>
  <text start="188.099" dur="7.26">heart they also do no iniquity they</text>
  <text start="191.28" dur="7.62">don&amp;#39;t sin they walk in his ways now that</text>
  <text start="195.359" dur="6.871">word iniquity or sin how is how is sin</text>
  <text start="198.9" dur="5.25">defined I&amp;#39;ve talked about this many</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="6.479">times too but i&amp;#39;ll go over it again you</text>
  <text start="204.15" dur="8.13">go to first John chapter 3 verse 4 it</text>
  <text start="208.709" dur="6.81">says whosoever commits sin transgresses</text>
  <text start="212.28" dur="8.569">also the law the torah for sin is the</text>
  <text start="215.519" dur="8.4">transgression of the law of the Torah so</text>
  <text start="220.849" dur="5.98">sin is breaking the Commandments in the</text>
  <text start="223.919" dur="6.271">Torah in the scriptures that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.829" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s how sin is defined now what is</text>
  <text start="230.19" dur="5.34">what is Jesus what does Yahshua say</text>
  <text start="232.139" dur="4.921">about about sin does he say that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.53" dur="3.15">just going to continue to sin that we</text>
  <text start="237.06" dur="3.84">have to sin that there&amp;#39;s no way we can</text>
  <text start="238.68" dur="5.1">help but sin that there&amp;#39;s no way we can</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="4.32">keep his law that he obeys it so we</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="5.359">don&amp;#39;t have to did you see anything like</text>
  <text start="245.22" dur="7.919">that no if you go to John chapter 5</text>
  <text start="249.139" dur="6.66">don&amp;#39;t worry heals the man who&amp;#39;s lame and</text>
  <text start="253.139" dur="6.111">he tells him to take up his bed and walk</text>
  <text start="255.799" dur="6.991">well after he heals him</text>
  <text start="259.25" dur="6.2">as in verse 14 this is John 5 verse 14</text>
  <text start="262.79" dur="6">this is the Gospel of John verse 14</text>
  <text start="265.45" dur="4.78">afterward Yahshua findeth him the man</text>
  <text start="268.79" dur="4.02">that he healed in the temple and said</text>
  <text start="270.23" dur="6.17">unto him behold you are made whole sin</text>
  <text start="272.81" dur="6.57">no more lest a worse thing coming to you</text>
  <text start="276.4" dur="4.69">wait a minute I thought we had the set I</text>
  <text start="279.38" dur="3.3">thought sin was inevitable i thought it</text>
  <text start="281.09" dur="4.1">was impossible to keep all the</text>
  <text start="282.68" dur="4.86">commandments in torah that were human</text>
  <text start="285.19" dur="5.25">well that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense because</text>
  <text start="287.54" dur="7.02">right here yah showed Jesus he says</text>
  <text start="290.44" dur="6.82">don&amp;#39;t sin again sin no more don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="294.56" dur="4.05">back and sin because if you do a worse</text>
  <text start="297.26" dur="4.14">thing will come upon you now that you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="298.61" dur="4.77">been healed you see and so many people</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="3.72">who are professing to believe in Messiah</text>
  <text start="303.38" dur="3.69">and Yahshua and then they go back to a</text>
  <text start="305.12" dur="4.29">lifestyle of sin they go back to</text>
  <text start="307.07" dur="6">committing sin because they say oh well</text>
  <text start="309.41" dur="5.73">you know that&amp;#39;s okay because Jesus is</text>
  <text start="313.07" dur="5.79">mercy covers me the worst thing is going</text>
  <text start="315.14" dur="5.97">to come upon them worse things in a</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="4.59">component and this is also this John</text>
  <text start="321.11" dur="5.13">chapter 5 verse 14 is very much like the</text>
  <text start="323.45" dur="4.86">statement Yahshua makes to the woman</text>
  <text start="326.24" dur="5.46">caught in adultery what does he tell her</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="4.95">he says go and sin no more he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="331.7" dur="5.04">going to tell her to do something that</text>
  <text start="333.26" dur="6.42">is impossible to do he&amp;#39;s telling her to</text>
  <text start="336.74" dur="6.48">do that which is possible if we make</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="5.01">Yahshua our King our Lord our Savior if</text>
  <text start="343.22" dur="4.5">he is sitting on the throne of our heart</text>
  <text start="344.69" dur="5.1">then threw him on a daily basis we can</text>
  <text start="347.72" dur="4.52">overcome temptation and we can walk</text>
  <text start="349.79" dur="5.66">without soon we can keep his</text>
  <text start="352.24" dur="6.28">Commandments we can obey his Torah and</text>
  <text start="355.45" dur="7">from Genesis to Revelation the scripture</text>
  <text start="358.52" dur="8.1">is clear it&amp;#39;s clear that that is what we</text>
  <text start="362.45" dur="5.88">must do so again the idea that somehow</text>
  <text start="366.62" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s impossible to keep its Commandments</text>
  <text start="368.33" dur="6.899">that&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s a myth another verse i</text>
  <text start="371.84" dur="6.329">like to use a lot is in Luke 1 verse 6</text>
  <text start="375.229" dur="6.811">this is describing John the Baptist</text>
  <text start="378.169" dur="5.191">joking on the Mercer&amp;#39;s parents Zacchaeus</text>
  <text start="382.04" dur="3.99">and Elizabeth that says that they were</text>
  <text start="383.36" dur="4.71">both righteous before yah walking in all</text>
  <text start="386.03" dur="4.33">the commandments and ordinances of</text>
  <text start="388.07" dur="6.529">yahweh blameless</text>
  <text start="390.36" dur="6.369">you see that it doesn&amp;#39;t say that that</text>
  <text start="394.599" dur="3.991">that somehow all they were doing the</text>
  <text start="396.729" dur="4.321">best they could or will they still know</text>
  <text start="398.59" dur="4.44">it says they were both righteous before</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="3.48">God they were walking in all the</text>
  <text start="403.03" dur="5.49">commandments and ordinances of the Lord</text>
  <text start="404.53" dur="6.33">blameless so they were doing everything</text>
  <text start="408.52" dur="3.84">right there were 11 God with all their</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="2.94">heart soul mind and strength loving</text>
  <text start="412.36" dur="5.519">their neighbors themselves they were</text>
  <text start="413.8" dur="5.609">keeping the commandments they were</text>
  <text start="417.879" dur="6.15">living the way that we&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="419.409" dur="8.85">live it&amp;#39;s also important to remember</text>
  <text start="424.029" dur="5.91">that the Pharisees and the Sadducees for</text>
  <text start="428.259" dur="5.25">the most part the ones that Yasha was</text>
  <text start="429.939" dur="5.431">rebuking they were not keeping the</text>
  <text start="433.509" dur="4.4">commandments okay they were keeping</text>
  <text start="435.37" dur="5.909">their own traditions many of which were</text>
  <text start="437.909" dur="6.581">violating the Torah okay and actually</text>
  <text start="441.279" dur="6.931">you can you can you can look at that</text>
  <text start="444.49" dur="6.12">also in John chapter 5 you go to the end</text>
  <text start="448.21" dur="5.1">of 5 where the Pharisees were trying to</text>
  <text start="450.61" dur="4.35">accuse him of breaking the Sabbath for</text>
  <text start="453.31" dur="4.109">healing this lame man which of course</text>
  <text start="454.96" dur="4.109">healing the lame man was not breaking</text>
  <text start="457.419" dur="4.74">the Sabbath day there&amp;#39;s nothing in Torah</text>
  <text start="459.069" dur="4.891">that says that to heal someone is to is</text>
  <text start="462.159" dur="3.51">to break the sabbath but see again the</text>
  <text start="463.96" dur="4.56">Pharisees and Sadducees they had</text>
  <text start="465.669" dur="6.451">invented their own traditions that they</text>
  <text start="468.52" dur="5.04">had added to the Torah and and they were</text>
  <text start="472.12" dur="3.479">following those more than they were</text>
  <text start="473.56" dur="4.49">actually following the commandments they</text>
  <text start="475.599" dur="5.49">were making their own righteousness okay</text>
  <text start="478.05" dur="9.1">so if you go to the end of John chapter</text>
  <text start="481.089" dur="7.98">5 it says in verse 46 for had you</text>
  <text start="487.15" dur="4.379">believed Moses you would have believed</text>
  <text start="489.069" dur="4.77">me for he wrote of me but if you believe</text>
  <text start="491.529" dur="7.081">not his writings how she you believe my</text>
  <text start="493.839" dur="7.83">words now that word believe means to to</text>
  <text start="498.61" dur="5.669">obey so basically you&amp;#39;re saying you</text>
  <text start="501.669" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t even believe Moses you know obey</text>
  <text start="504.279" dur="4.651">his writings you don&amp;#39;t keep his words so</text>
  <text start="506.919" dur="3.601">of course you&amp;#39;re not going to obey me</text>
  <text start="508.93" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;re not going to listen to me you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.52" dur="3.959">not going to pay attention to me so</text>
  <text start="512.8" dur="5.07">these Pharisees and Sadducees they were</text>
  <text start="514.479" dur="5.85">they were not actually following the</text>
  <text start="517.87" dur="4.589">commandments and writings of Moses</text>
  <text start="520.329" dur="3.961">they had invented their own oral</text>
  <text start="522.459" dur="4.581">traditions many of which just as Isaiah</text>
  <text start="524.29" dur="5.459">prophesied many of which actually made</text>
  <text start="527.04" dur="7.269">nullify the very commandments that they</text>
  <text start="529.749" dur="7.291">claimed to obey okay so that&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="534.309" dur="4.861">important to understand so we can obey</text>
  <text start="537.04" dur="7.529">the commandments we can obey the Torah</text>
  <text start="539.17" dur="8.009">we can obey this Bible we can go and sin</text>
  <text start="544.569" dur="5.221">no more that is the very purpose the</text>
  <text start="547.179" dur="4.62">very purpose of Yahshua sacrifice on the</text>
  <text start="549.79" dur="4.919">tree the very reason he shed his blood</text>
  <text start="551.799" dur="5.25">the very reason he wants to fill us with</text>
  <text start="554.709" dur="5.43">his Spirit this is the very purpose is</text>
  <text start="557.049" dur="5.85">so that we can obey Him its obedience</text>
  <text start="560.139" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s loving obedience because we&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="562.899" dur="4.321">grateful for what he&amp;#39;s done for us for</text>
  <text start="565.569" dur="3.8">how He shed his blood for us how He gave</text>
  <text start="567.22" dur="6">His life breasts we&amp;#39;re so grateful that</text>
  <text start="569.369" dur="6.39">we want to obey Him and then he and he</text>
  <text start="573.22" dur="5.64">threw his spirit helps us to obey Him</text>
  <text start="575.759" dur="5.08">that is the essence of what the Bible</text>
  <text start="578.86" dur="3.719">teaches and anyone who tries to say well</text>
  <text start="580.839" dur="3">we&amp;#39;re just human we&amp;#39;re all going to send</text>
  <text start="582.579" dur="4.62">well there&amp;#39;s no way we could keep the</text>
  <text start="583.839" dur="6.391">planets that is just simply not what the</text>
