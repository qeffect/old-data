  <text start="8.16" dur="5.849">first night officially of Chanukah 2017</text>
  <text start="12.15" dur="4.86">Chanukah of the Jubilee year also known</text>
  <text start="14.009" dur="5.371">as the feast of dedication or the winter</text>
  <text start="17.01" dur="4.56">feast the festival of lights is also as</text>
  <text start="19.38" dur="4.53">it is known this is the feast of</text>
  <text start="21.57" dur="4.35">Hanukkah it lasts for eight days and we</text>
  <text start="23.91" dur="4.529">know that even Yahshua of Nazareth Jesus</text>
  <text start="25.92" dur="4.41">himself celebrated Hanukkah you can read</text>
  <text start="28.439" dur="4.89">about it in John chapter 10 starting in</text>
  <text start="30.33" dur="5.159">verse 22 where he celebrated Hanukkah up</text>
  <text start="33.329" dur="4.741">at the temple in Solomon&amp;#39;s porch and</text>
  <text start="35.489" dur="6.271">contended with the pharisees and</text>
  <text start="38.07" dur="6.09">sadducees up at the Temple Mount this is</text>
  <text start="41.76" dur="5.01">a very important feast to observe and to</text>
  <text start="44.16" dur="4.05">keep it has prophetic implications but I</text>
  <text start="46.77" dur="3.84">just want to briefly talk about what</text>
  <text start="48.21" dur="4.05">Hanukah is all about if you read first</text>
  <text start="50.61" dur="4.35">and second Maccabees which are detailed</text>
  <text start="52.26" dur="5.16">historical accounts of what occurred</text>
  <text start="54.96" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;ll find out all the events that that</text>
  <text start="57.42" dur="3.479">happened for Hanukah</text>
  <text start="58.53" dur="4.77">but basically what happened was a small</text>
  <text start="60.899" dur="3.69">band of guerrilla warfare fighters known</text>
  <text start="63.3" dur="3.24">as the Maccabees</text>
  <text start="64.589" dur="3.511">they pledged their hearts in their lives</text>
  <text start="66.54" dur="3.93">to yah they said that they would obey</text>
  <text start="68.1" dur="4.559">the Torah and they asked yah to help</text>
  <text start="70.47" dur="5.64">them defeat the Greeks the Greeks had</text>
  <text start="72.659" dur="5.46">come in and basically overrun Israel</text>
  <text start="76.11" dur="4.259">they had destroyed the temple sacrificed</text>
  <text start="78.119" dur="5.311">to pick on the altar force the Jews to</text>
  <text start="80.369" dur="5.461">eat unclean foods and not keep Sabbath</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="5.009">and enslaved them and so the Maccabees</text>
  <text start="85.83" dur="5.67">from the surrounding Judean hillside</text>
  <text start="88.439" dur="5.191">began to launch a guerrilla warfare</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="4.259">tactics against the largest empire in</text>
  <text start="93.63" dur="3.3">the world at the time and after a period</text>
  <text start="95.759" dur="3.211">of three and a half years they</text>
  <text start="96.93" dur="4.71">completely and totally drove the Greek</text>
  <text start="98.97" dur="5.25">armies out of Israel and liberated</text>
  <text start="101.64" dur="5.21">Israel and at the end of that three and</text>
  <text start="104.22" dur="4.8">a half years right around this time they</text>
  <text start="106.85" dur="4.15">rebuilt the temple they cleansed it and</text>
  <text start="109.02" dur="3.959">then rededicated it and it took eight</text>
  <text start="111" dur="3.21">days for them to rededicate and to</text>
  <text start="112.979" dur="3.6">cleanse the temple so that it could come</text>
  <text start="114.21" dur="3.93">back into full operation and so that is</text>
  <text start="116.579" dur="3.18">why we celebrate Hanukkah for eight days</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="3.299">of course we have eight candlesticks</text>
  <text start="119.759" dur="3.75">share along with the ninth Center</text>
  <text start="121.439" dur="3.811">candlestick which symbolizes yah yah</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="2.79">said he is the light of the world and so</text>
  <text start="125.25" dur="1.439">that&amp;#39;s why this is the festival of</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="2.721">lights</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="4.831">but this festival is about overcoming</text>
  <text start="129.02" dur="4.99">impossible odds to the power of Yama</text>
  <text start="131.52" dur="4.499">that if we put our full faith in Him</text>
  <text start="134.01" dur="3.809">we yield our wills completely to him if</text>
  <text start="136.019" dur="4.261">we obey Him and pledge to obey his Torah</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="4.2">to the best of our ability if we promise</text>
  <text start="140.28" dur="2.819">and we actually love him with all our</text>
  <text start="142.019" dur="2.881">heart soul mind and strength and love</text>
  <text start="143.099" dur="3.961">our neighbors herself he will help us</text>
  <text start="144.9" dur="4.589">overcome impossible odds in our lives</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="5.34">just as he helped that small band of</text>
  <text start="149.489" dur="5.67">Jewish rebels the Maccabees overcome the</text>
  <text start="152.4" dur="6">largest empire the Greeks way back then</text>
  <text start="155.159" dur="6">and it&amp;#39;s also about rededicating your</text>
  <text start="158.4" dur="4.38">temple to Yahshua because this is the</text>
  <text start="161.159" dur="2.851">time they rededicated the temple they</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="3.959">cleansed the temple they brought it back</text>
  <text start="164.01" dur="4.77">to full functionality this is when we</text>
  <text start="166.739" dur="5.571">rededicate our temples our hearts our</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="6.39">lives our bodies to yata it&amp;#39;s eight days</text>
  <text start="172.31" dur="5.079">it&amp;#39;s a festive feast a lot of people say</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="3.75">oh you can&amp;#39;t do a nine branch tonic here</text>
  <text start="177.389" dur="3.18">because that that deviates from the</text>
  <text start="178.92" dur="3.87">scriptural seven branch menorah but</text>
  <text start="180.569" dur="4.651">that&amp;#39;s not true you go to Zechariah you</text>
  <text start="182.79" dur="4.289">will see a seven branch menorah and on</text>
  <text start="185.22" dur="3.9">either side there are two olive trees</text>
  <text start="187.079" dur="4.321">representing the two witnesses which</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="5.039">forms a nine tiered menorah or a</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="5.1">Hanukkah which foreshadowed this very</text>
  <text start="194.159" dur="4.621">festival the feast of Hanukkah which is</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="4.26">from the 25th day of the ninth month and</text>
  <text start="198.78" dur="3.45">always goes for eight days it is the</text>
  <text start="200.76" dur="3.42">only feast day that straddles two</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="3.539">different months we start off in the 90</text>
  <text start="204.18" dur="4.919">per month and by the time we get to the</text>
  <text start="205.769" dur="5.491">last day of Hanukkah we&amp;#39;ll be second or</text>
  <text start="209.099" dur="3.211">third day into the Tempe per month so</text>
  <text start="211.26" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;ll actually have a new moon in the</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="5.37">midst of Hanukkah this year as we do</text>
  <text start="214.44" dur="5.22">every year and yeah it&amp;#39;s just a time of</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="4.86">rejoicing of praising Yama</text>
  <text start="219.66" dur="4.35">of glorifying him and of recognizing</text>
  <text start="222.54" dur="3.27">that when we pledge our hearts to him he</text>
  <text start="224.01" dur="4.379">will help us overcome impossible odds in</text>
  <text start="225.81" dur="4.859">our lives and a time to rededicate our</text>
