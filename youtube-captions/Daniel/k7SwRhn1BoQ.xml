  <text start="160.85" dur="4.98">if you turn away your foot from the</text>
  <text start="163.459" dur="5.371">Sabbath from doing your pleasure on my</text>
  <text start="165.83" dur="6.27">holy day and call the shabbat a delight</text>
  <text start="168.83" dur="6.03">the holy of yahweh honorable and shall</text>
  <text start="172.1" dur="4.74">honor him not doing your own ways nor</text>
  <text start="174.86" dur="4.62">finding your own pleasure nor speaking</text>
  <text start="176.84" dur="5.04">your own words then shout you delight</text>
  <text start="179.48" dur="4.92">yourself in Yahweh and I will cause you</text>
  <text start="181.88" dur="5.37">to ride upon the high places of the</text>
  <text start="184.4" dur="5.309">earth and feed you with the heritage of</text>
  <text start="187.25" dur="6.06">Yaakov your father for the mouth of</text>
  <text start="189.709" dur="6.541">Yahweh has spoken it so there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="193.31" dur="6.48">concepts here that are are very clear</text>
  <text start="196.25" dur="7.68">here in Isaiah 58 starting in verses 4</text>
  <text start="199.79" dur="6.81">verses 5 going through 14 one is is that</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="5.76">we are to take care of the poor the</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="5.79">widows the orphans the other is is that</text>
  <text start="209.69" dur="5.06">we are to delight in his Sabbath Shabbat</text>
  <text start="212.39" dur="4.86">from Friday evening to Saturday evening</text>
  <text start="214.75" dur="4.959">we&amp;#39;re not to be doing our own things and</text>
  <text start="217.25" dur="4.799">pursuing our own ideas and our own goals</text>
  <text start="219.709" dur="5.041">but were to be delighting in him and</text>
  <text start="222.049" dur="6.211">seeking him glorifying him on the</text>
  <text start="224.75" dur="6.18">Shabbat and there are some amazing</text>
  <text start="228.26" dur="4.86">promises when we do these two things he</text>
  <text start="230.93" dur="3.96">talks about our our light shining in the</text>
  <text start="233.12" dur="3.899">darkness he talks about being our rear</text>
  <text start="234.89" dur="4.86">award about covering us in protecting us</text>
  <text start="237.019" dur="6.091">and blessing us beyond what we can</text>
  <text start="239.75" dur="6.239">possibly imagine and this is a very very</text>
  <text start="243.11" dur="9.39">important thing um this concept is also</text>
  <text start="245.989" dur="9.271">in Leviticus 23 in verse 22 it says when</text>
  <text start="252.5" dur="4.44">you reap the harvest of your land you</text>
  <text start="255.26" dur="3.409">shall not make clean riddance of the</text>
  <text start="256.94" dur="4.26">corners of your field when you reap</text>
  <text start="258.669" dur="3.851">neither shall you gather any gleaning of</text>
  <text start="261.2" dur="4.17">your harvest you shall leave them under</text>
  <text start="262.52" dur="3.9">the poor into the stranger I am Yahweh</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="3.99">you&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="266.42" dur="5.52">so when a farmer in ancient Israel would</text>
  <text start="269.36" dur="5.01">have his his plot of land he would not</text>
  <text start="271.94" dur="4.83">reach the corners or he should not reap</text>
  <text start="274.37" dur="3.93">the corners of his of his property</text>
  <text start="276.77" dur="4.44">because he would leave that for the poor</text>
  <text start="278.3" dur="6.9">on the stranger and the widow to go in</text>
  <text start="281.21" dur="7.49">and and pick whatever he could he or she</text>
  <text start="285.2" dur="9.65">could in order to sustain themselves and</text>
  <text start="288.7" dur="6.15">this principle continues to this day um</text>
  <text start="295.45" dur="8.29">it&amp;#39;s very very important that we do this</text>
  <text start="299.59" dur="5.89">very very important when Yahweh blesses</text>
  <text start="303.74" dur="4.02">us with increase we need to make sure</text>
  <text start="305.48" dur="5.43">that we&amp;#39;re giving to the poor the widow</text>
  <text start="307.76" dur="6.51">the orphan that we give a portion of</text>
  <text start="310.91" dur="4.68">what we make to that cause and it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="314.27" dur="5.93">very very important that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="9.45">delighting in his Shabbat I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="320.2" dur="8.29">ever to get so caught up in current</text>
  <text start="325.04" dur="5.31">events and in prophecy and in all these</text>
  <text start="328.49" dur="5.76">things that are going on that I forget</text>
  <text start="330.35" dur="5.46">to do the basic things that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="334.25" dur="5.79">supposed to be doing as believers in</text>
  <text start="335.81" dur="7.32">Yeshua and to delight in his Sabbath day</text>
  <text start="340.04" dur="7.25">and to take care of the poor the widow</text>
  <text start="343.13" dur="6.51">and the orphan this is true religion</text>
  <text start="347.29" dur="6.91">this is what we&amp;#39;re supposed to be doing</text>
  <text start="349.64" dur="8.46">and then our light will shine in the</text>
  <text start="354.2" dur="8.7">darkness and then Yahweh will satisfy</text>
  <text start="358.1" dur="7.92">our soul and drought notice it&amp;#39;s not all</text>
  <text start="362.9" dur="5.19">about hoarding food it&amp;#39;s not all about</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="8.15">making a punk rock wilderness not about</text>
  <text start="368.09" dur="9.99">that it&amp;#39;s hey draw your soul to the poor</text>
  <text start="374.17" dur="6.97">you delight in his Shabbat he&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="378.08" dur="8.58">care of you he&amp;#39;ll protect you hilgard</text>
  <text start="381.14" dur="7.23">you no matter what happens anyway I just</text>
  <text start="386.66" dur="3.96">thought this was a very important thing</text>
  <text start="388.37" dur="3.87">to bring out I was I was meditating on</text>
  <text start="390.62" dur="5.4">this last night as the Sabbath was</text>
  <text start="392.24" dur="7.53">beginning and it just stirred my soul</text>
  <text start="396.02" dur="4.3">and also yesterday a couple days ago I</text>
  <text start="399.77" dur="2.86">had gotten</text>
  <text start="400.32" dur="6.06">something in the mail about there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="402.63" dur="7.44">place that I send some money to to help</text>
  <text start="406.38" dur="7.38">the widows and orphans and I had gotten</text>
  <text start="410.07" dur="5.7">a little packet just detailing what was</text>
  <text start="413.76" dur="4.47">going on and with some of the orphanages</text>
  <text start="415.77" dur="4.11">and things like that and just when I</text>
  <text start="418.23" dur="3.72">read the scripture and then combined</text>
  <text start="419.88" dur="4.32">with looking at that it just it just</text>
  <text start="421.95" dur="4.86">again stirred my heart to to talk about</text>
  <text start="424.2" dur="6.12">this because I think it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="426.81" dur="7.38">important and you know of course I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="430.32" dur="6.54">even need to go into how Yahshua and the</text>
  <text start="434.19" dur="5.85">Apostle Paul rabbi show rule talked</text>
  <text start="436.86" dur="8.7">about this as well how important it is</text>

  <text start="445.56" dur="6.06">orphans and the poor it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="448.95" dur="4.71">important and of course the lighting in</text>
