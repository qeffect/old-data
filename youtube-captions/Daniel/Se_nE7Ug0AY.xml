  <text start="6.87" dur="6.149">having these in-home births which is</text>
  <text start="10.92" dur="3.81">ironic because midwifery is like a</text>
  <text start="13.019" dur="4.111">wonderful thing to have actually home</text>
  <text start="14.73" dur="4.08">births and yet they&amp;#39;ve twisted it don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="17.13" dur="2.88">think they&amp;#39;re other for a minute it&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="25.019" dur="4.141">her whole job is to do is give birth to</text>
  <text start="27.449" dur="3.84">the coven that she belongs to for</text>
  <text start="29.16" dur="5.1">satanical sacrifice purposes to get the</text>
  <text start="31.289" dur="4.471">power have you have you ever I mean I</text>
  <text start="34.26" dur="3.479">know you know this is going on but have</text>

  <text start="37.739" dur="7.021">like a baby being sacrificed or any</text>
  <text start="41.19" dur="5.209">cases related to that at all or I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="44.76" dur="6.569">say that I&amp;#39;ve actually been to a</text>
  <text start="46.399" dur="8.531">homicide involving a sacrifice I what I</text>
  <text start="51.329" dur="6.96">do know and can tell you is I&amp;#39;m assigned</text>
  <text start="54.93" dur="6.6">to a homicide right now on volunteer old</text>
  <text start="58.289" dur="7.01">girl that suffered an injury allegedly</text>
  <text start="61.53" dur="7.23">from blunt trauma and we&amp;#39;re looking into</text>
  <text start="65.299" dur="5.741">the dad being maybe responsible for that</text>
  <text start="68.76" dur="6.41">he claims she fell off of a plastic push</text>
  <text start="71.04" dur="6.869">scooter I&amp;#39;m not assigning him into a</text>
  <text start="75.17" dur="4">satanical cult if you will but those are</text>
  <text start="77.909" dur="5.191">some of the cases that I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="79.17" dur="5.28">involved in but as far as the homicides</text>
  <text start="83.1" dur="2.85">involving children sometimes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="84.45" dur="2.76">just missing person right and you know</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="3.87">find it that&amp;#39;s correct</text>
  <text start="87.21" dur="5.49">right right do you have any experience</text>
  <text start="89.82" dur="4.53">at all with because we&amp;#39;ve been hearing</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="4.08">I&amp;#39;m hearing a lot from Fiona Barnett</text>
  <text start="94.35" dur="4.05">from others about these tunnels that go</text>
  <text start="96.78" dur="3.54">from the border you know underneath</text>
  <text start="98.4" dur="3.42">Mexico to here and back with the child</text>
  <text start="100.32" dur="3.72">sex trafficking that&amp;#39;s going on back and</text>
  <text start="101.82" dur="4.89">forth between Southern California and</text>
  <text start="104.04" dur="4.649">Mexico do you have any experience of</text>
  <text start="106.71" dur="3.63">that or fact in the mid 80s I was</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="2.97">assigned to the border crime prevention</text>
  <text start="110.34" dur="3.209">unit with the San Diego Police</text>
  <text start="111.659" dur="4.051">Department there&amp;#39;s a small group of</text>
  <text start="113.549" dur="5.841">selected members that patrol the rocky</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="8.449">stream beds and canyons in the early 80s</text>
  <text start="119.39" dur="7.24">during that time there was hardly any</text>
  <text start="124.159" dur="3.97">resemblance of a wall there was no light</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="3.18">so if you drive down there right now it</text>
  <text start="128.129" dur="4.741">looks like you know Grand Central</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="3.84">Station when we were down there our job</text>
  <text start="132.87" dur="4.32">was to prevent</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="6.059">the illegal entrant migrants from being</text>
  <text start="137.19" dur="4.379">robbed by border bandits in both sides</text>
  <text start="139.709" dur="3.991">of the fence so we were protecting the</text>
  <text start="141.569" dur="4.95">ileal or undocumented aliens</text>
  <text start="143.7" dur="4.86">coming into this country and it needed</text>
  <text start="146.519" dur="5.131">to be that way because our police chief</text>
  <text start="148.56" dur="5.399">at the time didn&amp;#39;t want citizens that</text>
  <text start="151.65" dur="3.54">were migrating illegal or illegal to</text>
  <text start="153.959" dur="3.901">come through and be a victim of a crime</text>
  <text start="155.19" dur="5.82">so they married us with Border Patrol</text>
  <text start="157.86" dur="5.459">and we had three teams and alpha Bravo</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="5.369">and a Charlie team and we would patrol</text>
  <text start="163.319" dur="6.661">these stream beds at night several times</text>
  <text start="166.379" dur="6.33">we saw activity along parts of the</text>
  <text start="169.98" dur="5.399">border that were not fenced in that you</text>
  <text start="172.709" dur="5.941">would have just drive thrus so I was on</text>
  <text start="175.379" dur="6.661">the cusp of the tunnels because as they</text>
  <text start="178.65" dur="5.97">were sending the politicians from DC out</text>
  <text start="182.04" dur="5.43">to the border how come there were so</text>
  <text start="184.62" dur="4.77">many shootings involving your unit</text>
  <text start="187.47" dur="3.72">versus these border bandits what can we</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="3.599">do to stop that well they finally got it</text>
  <text start="191.19" dur="4.919">smart and they sent these politicians</text>
  <text start="192.989" dur="7.051">out to walk with us at night and we say</text>
  <text start="196.109" dur="6.81">we found a body here the other day just</text>
  <text start="200.04" dur="4.68">by our own patrolling and we&amp;#39;ve also had</text>
  <text start="202.919" dur="3.421">reports from the migrants who have been</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="3.78">robbed by border band and said these</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="4.079">same border bandits are operating in</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="4.26">this Canyon there was a famous Canyon</text>
  <text start="210.419" dur="4.801">called goats Canyon and it was at near</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="3.69">the border field State Park which some</text>
  <text start="215.22" dur="3.659">of the news stations had already</text>
  <text start="216.45" dur="3.75">recently published you know if they had</text>
  <text start="218.879" dur="2.58">gone a little bit further they were too</text>
  <text start="220.2" dur="3.84">ran into smuggler Gulch</text>
  <text start="221.459" dur="5.791">then go go Canyon so we would work these</text>
  <text start="224.04" dur="5.339">canyons and there was no fences there</text>
  <text start="227.25" dur="4.139">there was just a like a chain-link thing</text>
  <text start="229.379" dur="4.021">that was pushed over we watched people</text>
  <text start="231.389" dur="4.291">get off the bus from Mexico come drop</text>
  <text start="233.4" dur="5.1">through an olive grove that night and</text>
  <text start="235.68" dur="4.83">get hit on by border bandits so when the</text>
  <text start="238.5" dur="4.349">politicians walked around with us we</text>
  <text start="240.51" dur="4.979">said you know what if minimally we need</text>
  <text start="242.849" dur="5.04">to put stadium lights up here and you</text>
  <text start="245.489" dur="4.11">got to have some barricade to keep</text>
  <text start="247.889" dur="3.541">people from just coming through</text>
  <text start="249.599" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;d watch bands full of illegal</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="4.139">migrants come through and try to make it</text>
  <text start="253.829" dur="4.111">off-road and some of those trails down</text>
  <text start="255.569" dur="4.801">there so I was on the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="257.94" dur="5.01">tunnels as soon as I rotated out of that</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="5.07">tour of duties so to speak</text>
  <text start="262.95" dur="3.21">you would hear that there was a</text>
  <text start="265.44" dur="6.65">warehouse</text>
  <text start="266.16" dur="8.01">son say Oh time Mesa where there was a</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="5.05">tunnel that came up through the middle</text>
  <text start="274.17" dur="5.58">of a warehouse so did I know about</text>
  <text start="277.14" dur="3.75">tunnels I did and I knew that that was</text>
  <text start="279.75" dur="4.02">in the beginning and I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="280.89" dur="4.8">opinionated when you&amp;#39;re with and I look</text>
  <text start="283.77" dur="4.91">at the wall and I&amp;#39;m a supporter of</text>
  <text start="285.69" dur="7.08">having the wall I support our president</text>
  <text start="288.68" dur="6.43">when you build a barrier that you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="292.77" dur="4.62">you can&amp;#39;t really stop anything from the</text>
  <text start="295.11" dur="5.49">other side they can&amp;#39;t come or go over</text>
  <text start="297.39" dur="4.95">and unless it&amp;#39;s uh high visible is where</text>
  <text start="300.6" dur="3.6">you can see through it it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="302.34" dur="3.74">make tunneling a lot easier in my</text>
  <text start="304.2" dur="5.85">opinion because you don&amp;#39;t have anybody</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="6.52">watching the once in the store if I go</text>
  <text start="310.05" dur="4.8">to an isolated area in remote Arizona or</text>
  <text start="312.6" dur="4.62">Texas where before there was all this</text>
  <text start="314.85" dur="6.09">trafficking now there&amp;#39;s this false sense</text>
  <text start="317.22" dur="7.26">security with the wall up they may find</text>
  <text start="320.94" dur="5.1">a way to insert a tunnel and they may</text>
  <text start="324.48" dur="3.24">insert more tunnels because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="326.04" dur="4.35">have the high visibility they once had</text>
  <text start="327.72" dur="4.77">now my understanding is these panels are</text>
  <text start="330.39" dur="4.02">clear and some of the areas that are</text>
  <text start="332.49" dur="5.82">being built in San Diego which is a good</text>
  <text start="334.41" dur="5.4">thing and I I think you&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="3.93">more exposure to tunnels</text>
  <text start="339.81" dur="4.29">yeah and I&amp;#39;ve also heard that because</text>
  <text start="342.24" dur="4.14">President Trump has talked about wall</text>
  <text start="344.1" dur="4.02">tech which is basically where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="346.38" dur="3.42">not just going to put up a wall but</text>
  <text start="348.12" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re gonna actually go underground</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="5.19">like 30 to 40 feet with this wall tech</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="4.35">in order to specifically prevent these</text>
  <text start="354.99" dur="3.54">tunnels from battle so instead it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="356.73" dur="5.79">going to be a track where they can</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="7.34">actually move vehicles or cameras at</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="7.05">will through either you know computer</text>
  <text start="365.87" dur="6.4">technology or they can actually go</text>
  <text start="369.57" dur="5.22">hands-on right they&amp;#39;re not gonna be just</text>
  <text start="372.27" dur="5.97">a fence top it&amp;#39;s gonna be something that</text>
  <text start="374.79" dur="6.84">you can actually patrol right so would</text>
  <text start="378.24" dur="7.38">you say that the the pedophilia that you</text>
  <text start="381.63" dur="6.3">see going on here in in in the area is</text>
  <text start="385.62" dur="3.78">it heavier than what you would expect me</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="2.79">I mean I know you don&amp;#39;t work as office</text>
  <text start="389.4" dur="3">in the entire United States but would</text>
  <text start="390.72" dur="3.449">you say it&amp;#39;s heavier year than it would</text>
  <text start="392.4" dur="6.36">be like saying another part of the</text>
  <text start="394.169" dur="5.761">country or I&amp;#39;m not sure feeling I I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="398.76" dur="5.129">got a mixed</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="7.2">thought process on that I think there</text>
  <text start="403.889" dur="7.441">are attempts by certain organizations to</text>
  <text start="407.13" dur="7.62">expose that and have society accept that</text>
  <text start="411.33" dur="5.79">type of behavior just as you got to</text>
  <text start="414.75" dur="3.84">realize I have seen a lot in 40 years of</text>
  <text start="417.12" dur="3.66">my career in law enforcement taking</text>
  <text start="418.59" dur="3.9">marijuana for example when I first came</text>
  <text start="420.78" dur="3.63">on if you had an ounce you went to jail</text>
  <text start="422.49" dur="3.899">for a felony and even before me if you</text>
  <text start="424.41" dur="3.96">had a couple of seeds you went to jail</text>
  <text start="426.389" dur="4.921">for a felony and so look at the</text>
  <text start="428.37" dur="5.49">evolution of just marijuana now you know</text>
  <text start="431.31" dur="4.5">you go to Humboldt County you know that</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;ll the hippies back in the day</text>
  <text start="435.81" dur="3.99">never had the problems that they did</text>
  <text start="437.37" dur="5.34">when the cartel took over and this in</text>
  <text start="439.8" dur="5.73">the same thing when people are trying to</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="4.26">get licensed on their own business then</text>
  <text start="445.53" dur="4.41">they got to worry about people ripping</text>
  <text start="446.97" dur="5.16">them off and in there they&amp;#39;re paying a</text>
  <text start="449.94" dur="4.47">lot of taxes up there for the permits</text>
  <text start="452.13" dur="7.05">and both state and feds and then you</text>
  <text start="454.41" dur="6.33">then you have that element that thinks</text>
  <text start="459.18" dur="3.48">you could get in a car and just drive up</text>
  <text start="460.74" dur="3.66">there and get a job as a clipper or a</text>
  <text start="462.66" dur="4.23">picker those days are over</text>
  <text start="464.4" dur="5.79">but that the evolution of marijuana the</text>
  <text start="466.89" dur="5.97">evolution of gay and lesbians in our</text>
  <text start="470.19" dur="4.65">society and how far we&amp;#39;ve come back when</text>
  <text start="472.86" dur="4.02">I was going for an interview for the San</text>
  <text start="474.84" dur="5.07">Diego Police Department you could not be</text>
  <text start="476.88" dur="4.95">a homosexual or gay and apply they just</text>
  <text start="479.91" dur="5.31">did wouldn&amp;#39;t hire you right you look at</text>
  <text start="481.83" dur="5.7">the how we&amp;#39;ve evolved as a society like</text>
  <text start="485.22" dur="4.199">that now here I mentioned marijuana here</text>
  <text start="487.53" dur="3.509">I&amp;#39;ve mentioned the gay and lesbian</text>
  <text start="489.419" dur="3.391">community in this society</text>
  <text start="491.039" dur="4.471">acceptance of that and you look at</text>
  <text start="492.81" dur="4.859">same-sex marriage and those things that</text>
  <text start="495.51" dur="4.529">have gone in our society pedophilia is</text>
  <text start="497.669" dur="4.981">no different right pedophilia is coming</text>
  <text start="500.039" dur="5.25">I see it in my work I can tell when</text>
  <text start="502.65" dur="8.639">people are trying there&amp;#39;s blogs out</text>
  <text start="505.289" dur="7.891">there support groups and there&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="511.289" dur="3.781">gentleman that has a blog that he says</text>
  <text start="513.18" dur="4.229">he&amp;#39;s a non offending pedophilia</text>
  <text start="515.07" dur="5.04">he&amp;#39;s never touched a child done this</text>
  <text start="517.409" dur="5.67">he&amp;#39;s never done that and virtuous</text>

  <text start="527.779" dur="4.511">individuals on the Internet are</text>
  <text start="529.92" dur="4.109">basically supporting those people that</text>
  <text start="532.29" dur="4.349">know they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re pedophiles and he</text>
  <text start="534.029" dur="4.441">goes into his story about it how when he</text>
  <text start="536.639" dur="3.75">was a kid his dad brought his friend</text>
  <text start="538.47" dur="4.65">over the head of a girl and he found</text>
  <text start="540.389" dur="4.32">himself attracted as as he got older he</text>
  <text start="543.12" dur="4.38">was still attracted to the same age</text>
  <text start="544.709" dur="4.831">group he explains his story on on that</text>
  <text start="547.5" dur="4.35">webpage but anyway when you&amp;#39;re when</text>
  <text start="549.54" dur="5.039">you&amp;#39;re looking for these guys that&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="566.759" dur="4.26">I&amp;#39;ve ever heard one exactly how can you</text>
  <text start="568.74" dur="4.86">in our society how can you say that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="571.019" dur="4.62">morally correct right and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="573.6" dur="6.03">virtuous means morally correct</text>
  <text start="575.639" dur="6.901">Bernadette is an oxymoron so and look at</text>
  <text start="579.63" dur="5.88">the pattern of society in in adult</text>
  <text start="582.54" dur="7.89">behavior and how easily is acceptable</text>
  <text start="585.51" dur="8.04">and I just can&amp;#39;t accept predator sexual</text>
  <text start="590.43" dur="5.55">predators of children and I don&amp;#39;t care</text>
