  <text start="0.03" dur="5.849">hello everyone I am making a I guess</text>
  <text start="4.11" dur="4.02">this would be a correction to my video</text>
  <text start="5.879" dur="4.441">from this afternoon</text>
  <text start="8.13" dur="4.17">people say I&amp;#39;m a shill because I only</text>
  <text start="10.32" dur="6">played a small snippet of the Mark</text>
  <text start="12.3" dur="7.37">Taylor Russ Wagner video actually in my</text>
  <text start="16.32" dur="5.85">video earlier today I did explain that</text>
  <text start="19.67" dur="4.66">Russ magner is being very careless with</text>
  <text start="22.17" dur="4.98">his words so if you listen to the full</text>
  <text start="24.33" dur="5.55">context of the video what rats Wagner is</text>
  <text start="27.15" dur="5.51">saying is that Jesus is not the head of</text>
  <text start="29.88" dur="7.26">the church and he&amp;#39;s defining Church as</text>
  <text start="32.66" dur="7.87">this pagan institution that was started</text>
  <text start="37.14" dur="5.64">by Constantine however I just want to</text>
  <text start="40.53" dur="3.99">say something real quickly I&amp;#39;m not a I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="42.78" dur="3.299">not a dumb person and many of my</text>
  <text start="44.52" dur="4.32">subscribers are not dumb they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="46.079" dur="5.46">intelligent as well and many people</text>
  <text start="48.84" dur="4.559">including myself we&amp;#39;re very confused by</text>
  <text start="51.539" dur="4.371">what Russ ragnar said when he said that</text>
  <text start="53.399" dur="5.371">Jesus is not that of a church okay I</text>
  <text start="55.91" dur="5.5">think and and I made this point in my</text>
  <text start="58.77" dur="4.379">video earlier today that Russ Wagner is</text>
  <text start="61.41" dur="4.98">very careless with his words there was a</text>
  <text start="63.149" dur="5.101">much more clearer way of describing what</text>
  <text start="66.39" dur="3.81">he was talking about you know he could</text>
  <text start="68.25" dur="5.159">have said that Jesus didn&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="70.2" dur="7.919">the head of this pagan institution okay</text>
  <text start="73.409" dur="6.691">that was formed by Constantine putting</text>
  <text start="78.119" dur="3.451">together Christianity with paganism that</text>
  <text start="80.1" dur="2.82">he could have made it very clear but</text>
  <text start="81.57" dur="4.38">instead he said Jesus didn&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="82.92" dur="5.94">the head of the church now I know I look</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="4.83">I&amp;#39;ve known since 2001 okay when I read</text>
  <text start="88.86" dur="4.049">Lou White&amp;#39;s book that church is a pagan</text>
  <text start="90.78" dur="3.839">word okay I&amp;#39;ve known that that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="92.909" dur="5.551">really the ecclesia or the body of</text>
  <text start="94.619" dur="6.301">Messiah but I think most believers</text>
  <text start="98.46" dur="4.799">understand that the true body of Messiah</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="4.199">is not a church building so when Russ</text>
  <text start="103.259" dur="4.171">Wagner and Mark Taylor continue to harp</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="4.68">on this I think it&amp;#39;s a very minor thing</text>
  <text start="107.43" dur="5.549">especially when you consider that Russ</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="6.451">magner embraces false prophets like Lou</text>
  <text start="112.979" dur="5.731">Engel and Jim gall who embraces Bethel</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="5.64">ministries that promotes tarot cards and</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="5.909">this satanic Dominion theology I also</text>
  <text start="121.89" dur="5.13">just found out that Mark Taylor has</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="6.211">spoken very highly of Rick Joyner guys</text>
  <text start="127.02" dur="6.54">Rick Joyner is an extremely pagan person</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="4.35">this guy is deeply involved in Dominion</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="3.51">theology if you don&amp;#39;t want know what</text>
  <text start="135.18" dur="6.09">Dominion theology is or the New</text>
  <text start="137.07" dur="7.28">Apostolic Reformation they believe that</text>
  <text start="141.27" dur="6.15">Christians will take over the earth and</text>
  <text start="144.35" dur="4.84">then Jesus will return they completely</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="3.87">and totally disregard revelation and</text>
  <text start="149.19" dur="4.26">these are the people that Mark Taylor</text>
  <text start="151.29" dur="9.09">and Russell Agner are associated with or</text>
  <text start="153.45" dur="9.51">speak well of so my question is what</text>
  <text start="160.38" dur="4.05">kind of body of Messiah is Russell</text>
  <text start="162.96" dur="3.8">Ragnar actually talking about it seems</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="5.13">like he&amp;#39;s talking about a satanic body</text>
  <text start="166.76" dur="5.65">that is headed up by people like Jim</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="6.39">gall and Bethel ministries that promotes</text>
  <text start="172.41" dur="6.39">tarot cards and Rick Joyner who promotes</text>
  <text start="175.95" dur="6.6">Dominion theology and the New Apostolic</text>
  <text start="178.8" dur="5.16">Reformation the NA are and I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="182.55" dur="2.85">videos in the past about Dominion</text>
  <text start="183.96" dur="4.44">theology and the dangers have been in</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="5.19">theology so okay I will say I was wrong</text>
  <text start="188.4" dur="3.54">in the context that Russ Ragnar was not</text>
  <text start="190.59" dur="3.21">saying Jesus isn&amp;#39;t the head of the body</text>
  <text start="191.94" dur="5.04">he&amp;#39;s saying Jesus is not the head of</text>
  <text start="193.8" dur="5.13">this pagan Church that&amp;#39;s fine I&amp;#39;ll make</text>
  <text start="196.98" dur="5.01">that correction but I&amp;#39;m gonna I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="198.93" dur="5.28">still say that the reason why that video</text>
  <text start="201.99" dur="3.84">cost so so many to be confused is</text>
  <text start="204.21" dur="4.47">because there&amp;#39;s a spirit of confusion</text>
  <text start="205.83" dur="5.19">operating through Russ Wagner and Mark</text>
  <text start="208.68" dur="4.89">Taylor because they&amp;#39;re not serving the</text>
  <text start="211.02" dur="4.83">true Messiah because they embrace things</text>
  <text start="213.57" dur="5.52">like Dominion theology which is absolute</text>
  <text start="215.85" dur="4.8">witchcraft and Satanism and I proved in</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="4.44">my video earlier today that jit that</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="4.89">rust Wagner&amp;#39;s website says Jim gall is</text>
  <text start="223.53" dur="7.02">one of his spiritual fathers and mentors</text>
  <text start="225.54" dur="7.31">that he studied under all right so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="230.55" dur="4.86">just making this correction video</text>
  <text start="232.85" dur="5.38">familiar today so don&amp;#39;t one can say</text>
  <text start="235.41" dur="5.57">Michele all right yeah bless you guys</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="2.75">Shalom Shalom</text>
