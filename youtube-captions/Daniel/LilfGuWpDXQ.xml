  <text start="10.65" dur="8.4">weekly shabbat shalom podcast welcome</text>
  <text start="13.88" dur="7.03">well we are now beginning a long holiday</text>
  <text start="19.05" dur="3.93">weekend for most Americans as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="20.91" dur="5.34">celebrating the fourth of July today</text>
  <text start="22.98" dur="4.95">actually is not only the weekly Sabbath</text>
  <text start="26.25" dur="3.51">day the shabbat shalom but it&amp;#39;s also the</text>
  <text start="27.93" dur="4.62">new moon it&amp;#39;s the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="29.76" dur="5.42">fourth month but because the fourth of</text>
  <text start="32.55" dur="4.8">July holiday is just around the corner</text>
  <text start="35.18" dur="5.379">happening in just a couple of days I</text>
  <text start="37.35" dur="4.77">wanted to talk about the history of the</text>
  <text start="40.559" dur="5.191">United States and how it relates to the</text>
  <text start="42.12" dur="6.27">Torah did you know that when the United</text>
  <text start="45.75" dur="4.68">States was first formed this was one of</text>
  <text start="48.39" dur="3.71">the few countries where the Jews felt</text>
  <text start="50.43" dur="6.21">like that they could emigrate to and</text>
  <text start="52.1" dur="7.36">feel safe they actually could feel like</text>
  <text start="56.64" dur="4.439">they could escape from persecution that</text>
  <text start="59.46" dur="4.949">that they were having to deal with</text>
  <text start="61.079" dur="5.941">throughout the rest of the world did you</text>
  <text start="64.409" dur="6.481">also know that when the early Pilgrims</text>
  <text start="67.02" dur="7.05">and Puritans settled here in the 1600s</text>
  <text start="70.89" dur="6.15">that the holiday of Christmas was</text>
  <text start="74.07" dur="5.46">outlawed it was illegal and this is</text>
  <text start="77.04" dur="4.5">because the early Puritans and pilgrims</text>
  <text start="79.53" dur="5.4">understood that Christmas was a pagan</text>
  <text start="81.54" dur="5.399">holiday indeed Christmas with all of its</text>
  <text start="84.93" dur="4.35">trappings of the Christmas tree mmm</text>
  <text start="86.939" dur="5.401">happening on December the 25th which</text>
  <text start="89.28" dur="5.97">happens to be the birthday of many pagan</text>
  <text start="92.34" dur="6.09">gods including the Sun God and was in</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="6">fact once the feast of Saturnalia which</text>
  <text start="98.43" dur="5.939">was a giant orgy pagan feast that the</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="5.52">Romans would celebrate that this is what</text>
  <text start="104.369" dur="4.981">eventually was adopted by the Roman</text>
  <text start="106.77" dur="5.25">Catholic Church and became Christmas so</text>
  <text start="109.35" dur="5.76">if you look at Christmas it&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="112.02" dur="4.98">very pagan holiday Jeremiah chapter 10</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="3.48">verses 1 through 6 describes the</text>
  <text start="117" dur="4.71">forerunner of a Christmas tree and</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="4.5">Yahweh calls it an abomination so we as</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="2.79">believers in Messiah should have nothing</text>
  <text start="123.09" dur="3.75">to do with Christmas and the early</text>
  <text start="124.5" dur="5.489">Pilgrims and Puritans who settled here</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="5.07">in the 1600s understood that and so in</text>
  <text start="129.989" dur="2.751">the Massachusetts Bay Colony for</text>
  <text start="131.91" dur="3.2">instance which is</text>
  <text start="132.74" dur="5.16">the earliest colonies that was formed it</text>
  <text start="135.11" dur="4.47">was the holiday of Christmas was was</text>
  <text start="137.9" dur="3.6">illegal you were not allowed to</text>
  <text start="139.58" dur="5.52">celebrate Christmas because it was pagan</text>
  <text start="141.5" dur="6.06">and had nothing to do with Yahweh as you</text>
  <text start="145.1" dur="5.61">also know that when you hear the story</text>
  <text start="147.56" dur="7.05">around Thanksgiving time about how the</text>
  <text start="150.71" dur="7.08">Indians and the pilgrims survived that</text>
  <text start="154.61" dur="5.58">first fall and winter that that was</text>
  <text start="157.79" dur="5.82">actually a celebration of Sukkot it</text>
  <text start="160.19" dur="5.7">occurred in October hmm which is when</text>
  <text start="163.61" dur="4.71">Sukkot normally occurs every year Sukkot</text>
  <text start="165.89" dur="4.83">of course is an eight day celebration</text>
  <text start="168.32" dur="4.53">that we are commanded to observe in</text>
  <text start="170.72" dur="4.65">Leviticus chapter 23 in which Yahshua</text>
  <text start="172.85" dur="5.13">the Messiah also observed and the</text>
  <text start="175.37" dur="5.1">pilgrims were keeping Sukkot as a</text>
  <text start="177.98" dur="4.05">regular feast because they were honoring</text>
  <text start="180.47" dur="3.21">and venerating the feast days that were</text>
  <text start="182.03" dur="3.72">in scriptures understanding that these</text>
  <text start="183.68" dur="5.67">feast days were not exclusively for the</text>
  <text start="185.75" dur="8.1">Jewish people but in fact these feast</text>
  <text start="189.35" dur="8.25">days were for all those who served the</text>
  <text start="193.85" dur="5.79">Lord who served Yahweh and so that that</text>
  <text start="197.6" dur="4.26">first Thanksgiving dinner was actually a</text>
  <text start="199.64" dur="4.77">feast of Sukkot feast of tabernacles</text>
  <text start="201.86" dur="6.15">that they were celebrating it was not</text>
  <text start="204.41" dur="6.78">until President Abraham Lincoln moved</text>
  <text start="208.01" dur="5.01">this feast to a month later in November</text>
  <text start="211.19" dur="5.91">that it then became known as</text>
  <text start="213.02" dur="6.15">Thanksgiving also did you know that</text>
  <text start="217.1" dur="4.5">about if you go about a hundred years</text>
  <text start="219.17" dur="4.83">into the future into the 1700s when the</text>
  <text start="221.6" dur="4.56">american revolution occurred even though</text>
  <text start="224" dur="4.37">christmas was not technically illegal at</text>
  <text start="226.16" dur="5.54">that point in most of the colonies</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="5.65">because the Puritans and pilgrims had</text>
  <text start="231.7" dur="3.55">not celebrated Christmas it was</text>
  <text start="234.02" dur="3.6">something that was imprinted in the</text>
  <text start="235.25" dur="4.83">culture so most people living in the</text>
  <text start="237.62" dur="5.49">United States of America even as late as</text>
  <text start="240.08" dur="5.67">the late 1700s were not celebrating</text>
  <text start="243.11" dur="4.35">Christmas it&amp;#39;s starting to catch on that</text>
  <text start="245.75" dur="5.3">the celebration of Christmas started to</text>
  <text start="247.46" dur="6.36">catch on again in England in the 1800s</text>
  <text start="251.05" dur="4.06">from the early to mid 1800s is when</text>
  <text start="253.82" dur="3.69">Christmas starting to catch on and then</text>
  <text start="255.11" dur="4.83">it sort of slowly sleep seeped back into</text>
  <text start="257.51" dur="5.159">the United States but in the late 1700s</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="5.13">enough of the culture of the Puritans</text>
  <text start="262.669" dur="3.961">and pilgrims still pervaded the nation</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="4.37">that most people the average</text>
  <text start="266.63" dur="8.31">citizen did not celebrate Christmas in</text>
  <text start="269.44" dur="9.31">1776 well this would prove to be a very</text>
  <text start="274.94" dur="6.24">dramatic helpful thing for the American</text>
  <text start="278.75" dur="4.35">revolutionaries because if you study</text>
  <text start="281.18" dur="5.07">history you will find out that General</text>
  <text start="283.1" dur="5.01">George Washington who had essentially</text>
  <text start="286.25" dur="4.08">been living off of one defeat after</text>
  <text start="288.11" dur="3.72">another he was hemmed in by the British</text>
  <text start="290.33" dur="3.24">the British looked like they were going</text>
  <text start="291.83" dur="4.32">to win the war they had the upper hand</text>
  <text start="293.57" dur="5.13">and what happened was is on Christmas</text>
  <text start="296.15" dur="5.1">Eve the British who were celebrating</text>
  <text start="298.7" dur="5.91">Christmas they were having sort of a</text>
  <text start="301.25" dur="6.42">drunken orgy feast Christmas Eve General</text>
  <text start="304.61" dur="5.34">George Washington and his soldiers they</text>
  <text start="307.67" dur="4.08">did not celebrate Christmas so because</text>
  <text start="309.95" dur="4.68">of this they decided to launch an ambush</text>
  <text start="311.75" dur="5.4">on the British soldiers and when they</text>
  <text start="314.63" dur="3.81">did this they totally slaughtered the</text>
  <text start="317.15" dur="4.32">British Army because they were</text>
  <text start="318.44" dur="4.35">completely unprepared being drunk and in</text>
  <text start="321.47" dur="3.33">the middle of their Christmas</text>
  <text start="322.79" dur="3.48">festivities because General George</text>
  <text start="324.8" dur="2.94">Washington and his soldiers did not</text>
  <text start="326.27" dur="2.67">celebrate Christmas understanding the</text>
  <text start="327.74" dur="4.11">pagan underpinnings of such a</text>
  <text start="328.94" dur="5.52">celebration they slaughtered the British</text>
  <text start="331.85" dur="5.16">and it was such a key and decisive</text>
  <text start="334.46" dur="5.18">victory that it wound up turning the</text>
  <text start="337.01" dur="5.16">tide of war and of course eventually</text>
  <text start="339.64" dur="5.14">America won the war and General George</text>
  <text start="342.17" dur="5.76">Washington became the first president so</text>
  <text start="344.78" dur="7.26">as you can see this nation has a history</text>
  <text start="347.93" dur="7.11">of entering the Torah when you went to</text>
  <text start="352.04" dur="7.32">your public school or what not growing</text>
  <text start="355.04" dur="7.26">up you may not have been taught who the</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="4.74">Puritans really were we are often taught</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="3.45">that the Puritans dressed in these gray</text>
  <text start="364.1" dur="3.66">clothes and they were very stern and</text>
  <text start="365.75" dur="6.33">grim and they never had any fun but this</text>
  <text start="367.76" dur="8.46">in fact is not exactly true people tend</text>
  <text start="372.08" dur="6.81">to try to revise history and spin</text>
  <text start="376.22" dur="5.31">history to push an agenda but if you</text>
  <text start="378.89" dur="4.95">truly study what who the Puritans</text>
  <text start="381.53" dur="4.47">actually were you will find that many of</text>
  <text start="383.84" dur="5.34">the Puritans would dress in bright</text>
  <text start="386" dur="5.64">colors there are very joyful people they</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="4.77">were fleeing the Church of England</text>
  <text start="391.64" dur="5.07">because the Church of England had become</text>
  <text start="393.95" dur="4.65">aligned with the church in Rome and they</text>
  <text start="396.71" dur="3.78">felt like they did not have freedom of</text>
  <text start="398.6" dur="4.289">religion and so they fled the church</text>
  <text start="400.49" dur="4.95">England to to have freedom to their</text>
  <text start="402.889" dur="4.5">religion to worship Yahweh in spirit and</text>
  <text start="405.44" dur="5.449">in truth and so when they first came to</text>
  <text start="407.389" dur="7.741">America they saw America as a Zion as a</text>
  <text start="410.889" dur="6.941">sort of a new Israel Israel reborn a</text>
  <text start="415.13" dur="4.95">city on the hill and these early</text>
  <text start="417.83" dur="4.679">Puritans they many of them kept the</text>
  <text start="420.08" dur="4.5">Sabbath day the seventh day shabbat from</text>
  <text start="422.509" dur="3.871">friday even to saturday evening many of</text>
  <text start="424.58" dur="3.51">them as we can see through the story of</text>
  <text start="426.38" dur="4.65">thanksgiving kept the hebrew festivals</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="5.669">such as Sukkot and many of them</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="4.289">understood the paganism of the</text>
  <text start="433.759" dur="3.72">celebrations that modern Christians</text>
  <text start="435.319" dur="4.47">celebrate today such as Christmas now</text>
  <text start="437.479" dur="4.5">which is why Christmas was illegal back</text>
  <text start="439.789" dur="3.391">in the 1600s and continued to be</text>
  <text start="441.979" dur="4.921">something that was not even celebrated</text>
  <text start="443.18" dur="7.519">as late as the 1700s so as we can see</text>
  <text start="446.9" dur="7.71">our nation has a heritage and history of</text>
  <text start="450.699" dur="5.771">keeping the the Torah of obeying the</text>
  <text start="454.61" dur="4.44">commandments of not participating in</text>
  <text start="456.47" dur="6.18">these pagan festivals I think it&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="459.05" dur="7.799">heritage that is what caused Yahweh to</text>
  <text start="462.65" dur="6.69">bless this nation so much and it&amp;#39;s these</text>
  <text start="466.849" dur="6.211">Pilgrims and Puritans they identified so</text>
  <text start="469.34" dur="5.879">much with Israel and with the Jewish</text>
  <text start="473.06" dur="4.05">people and with the Torah that they even</text>
  <text start="475.219" dur="4.681">call themselves a new Israel they</text>
  <text start="477.11" dur="5.369">envision themselves as a city on a hill</text>
  <text start="479.9" dur="4.5">and that they were going to be a light</text>
  <text start="482.479" dur="5.761">to the nation&amp;#39;s and I think this is why</text>
  <text start="484.4" dur="6.449">Yahweh blessed this nation so very much</text>
  <text start="488.24" dur="6.63">it was because we truly had a heritage</text>
  <text start="490.849" dur="7.681">rooted in obeying honoring and keeping</text>
  <text start="494.87" dur="6.06">the Torah so on this fourth of July as</text>
  <text start="498.53" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;re watching the fireworks as you are</text>
  <text start="500.93" dur="5.31">remembering the founding of this nation</text>
  <text start="502.46" dur="5.97">as you&amp;#39;re celebrating the birth of this</text>
  <text start="506.24" dur="4.859">nation and its independence from England</text>
  <text start="508.43" dur="5.099">remember that the heritage that this</text>
  <text start="511.099" dur="5.13">nation was originally blessed through</text>
  <text start="513.529" dur="4.921">was a heritage that was completely and</text>
  <text start="516.229" dur="4.74">totally founded on the Torah on the</text>
  <text start="518.45" dur="5.339">Bible on obeying and serving Yahshua on</text>
  <text start="520.969" dur="5.401">separating itself from the pagan</text>
  <text start="523.789" dur="4.471">festivals that hadn&amp;#39;t invested many of</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="2.75">the denominations of Christianity at the</text>
  <text start="528.26" dur="4.01">time</text>
  <text start="529.12" dur="7.29">and this is truly a heritage to be proud</text>
  <text start="532.27" dur="7.11">of so I think as believers as those who</text>
  <text start="536.41" dur="4.619">call ourselves followers of Messiah we</text>
  <text start="539.38" dur="6.54">should remember that this fourth of July</text>
  <text start="541.029" dur="7.171">is a time to meditate upon the fact that</text>
  <text start="545.92" dur="4.56">our heritage was based on obeying the</text>
  <text start="548.2" dur="4.5">Torah on living the Torah and on</text>
  <text start="550.48" dur="4.32">honoring Yahshua and that&amp;#39;s exactly how</text>
  <text start="552.7" dur="4.079">we should live today and it&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="554.8" dur="3.42">way to witness to your friends and</text>
  <text start="556.779" dur="3.991">family as you&amp;#39;re celebrating this fourth</text>
  <text start="558.22" dur="4.11">of July and let them know that though</text>
  <text start="560.77" dur="4.62">they might look at you is some sort of</text>
  <text start="562.33" dur="5.1">strange weird messianic who keeps all</text>
  <text start="565.39" dur="4.32">these Jewish things remind them that</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="4.32">according to history our founding</text>
  <text start="569.71" dur="4.05">fathers the Puritans and pilgrims who</text>
  <text start="571.75" dur="4.98">originally settled this land we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="573.76" dur="5.31">the exact same things and so you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="576.73" dur="4.32">actually quite so weird after all you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="579.07" dur="5.01">actually walking in the very footsteps</text>
  <text start="581.05" dur="5.22">of this nation&amp;#39;s forefathers shabbat</text>
  <text start="584.08" dur="6.68">shalom Happy New Moon and have a</text>
  <text start="586.27" dur="4.49">wonderful fourth of July goodbye</text>
