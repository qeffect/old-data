  <text start="60.719" dur="4.47">being tossed out of that holiness church</text>
  <text start="62.219" dur="4.801">I found myself on a crisp cool februari</text>
  <text start="65.189" dur="3.75">day preaching to a crowd of a hundred or</text>
  <text start="67.02" dur="4.68">so students at Portland State University</text>
  <text start="68.939" dur="4.771">a few weeks ago I had been delivered</text>
  <text start="71.7" dur="4.459">from a 40-hour week telemarketing job</text>
  <text start="73.71" dur="4.83">and landed a position at The Oregonian</text>
  <text start="76.159" dur="4.6">working in the matrix of cubicles that</text>
  <text start="78.54" dur="4.53">warm the Oregonian&amp;#39;s basement and found</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="4.29">that this new inside sales job not only</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="4.47">paid me almost three times the amount</text>
  <text start="85.049" dur="4.381">because my previous job but now I only</text>
  <text start="87.54" dur="3.1">had to work for about twenty five seven</text>
  <text start="89.43" dur="3.64">hours a week</text>
  <text start="90.64" dur="4.86">the afternoon of my first day on the job</text>
  <text start="93.07" dur="4.77">I called my wife it&amp;#39;s only two-thirty</text>
  <text start="95.5" dur="4.38">p.m. and i&amp;#39;m already done with work this</text>
  <text start="97.84" dur="4.26">is such a blessing Daniel my wife agreed</text>
  <text start="99.88" dur="4.5">my hand trembled with excitement as I</text>
  <text start="102.1" dur="5.01">helped the receiver close to my lips and</text>
  <text start="104.38" dur="4.349">honey the best part is the location do</text>
  <text start="107.11" dur="4.05">you realize I&amp;#39;m only a half block away</text>

  <text start="111.16" dur="3.39">preach there every day if I want I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="113.14" dur="3.92">going down there this afternoon I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="114.55" dur="4.8">meet you there my wife said excitedly</text>
  <text start="117.06" dur="4.75">and so my ministry at Portland State</text>
  <text start="119.35" dur="4.95">University was born I remember that</text>
  <text start="121.81" dur="3.75">first day very well my wife pushed the</text>
  <text start="124.3" dur="3.66">blue and white stroller with our</text>
  <text start="125.56" dur="4.05">sleeping newborn nestled inside though</text>
  <text start="127.96" dur="3.93">the trees on the park blocks for bear</text>
  <text start="129.61" dur="4.14">and leafless the bright blue sky warm</text>
  <text start="131.89" dur="4.59">Sun quickly transformed the winter&amp;#39;s day</text>
  <text start="133.75" dur="4.769">into an almost spring feeling when I</text>
  <text start="136.48" dur="3.539">initially arrived one female student</text>
  <text start="138.519" dur="3.991">lingered near the freedom of speech Eric</text>
  <text start="140.019" dur="4.47">stage as I began lifting up my voice to</text>
  <text start="142.51" dur="3.6">preach the student yelled at me but</text>
  <text start="144.489" dur="3.601">Daniel what about all the many</text>
  <text start="146.11" dur="4.62">contradictions in logan in the Levitical</text>
  <text start="148.09" dur="4.619">law now being raised as a good Christian</text>
  <text start="150.73" dur="4.71">nondenominational boy my knowledge of</text>
  <text start="152.709" dur="4.171">the Levitical law was very limited but</text>
  <text start="155.44" dur="3.51">as the girl began to try and point out</text>
  <text start="156.88" dur="4.169">contradictions the Holy Spirit showed me</text>
  <text start="158.95" dur="4.71">again and again how foolish or arguments</text>
  <text start="161.049" dur="4.951">work at the same time I began to realize</text>
  <text start="163.66" dur="4.47">as the spirit helped me to contend that</text>
  <text start="166" dur="4.14">the Levitical law was perfect beautiful</text>
  <text start="168.13" dur="2.89">and supremely reasonable in all its</text>
  <text start="170.14" dur="2.92">facets</text>
  <text start="171.02" dur="4.41">a crowd of a hundred soon swelled with</text>
  <text start="173.06" dur="4.35">200 and the Spirit gave me one response</text>
  <text start="175.43" dur="4.14">after another showing me how to defend</text>
  <text start="177.41" dur="4.53">the Levitical law magnifying it in all</text>
  <text start="179.57" dur="4.53">its beauty trembling I began to wonder</text>
  <text start="181.94" dur="4.65">it odd how incredibly sober the crowd</text>
  <text start="184.1" dur="4.47">was conviction was falling in waves as I</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="3.78">had never seen before something truly</text>
  <text start="188.57" dur="4.38">new and different birth that early</text>
  <text start="190.37" dur="4.68">afternoon on campus after preaching for</text>
  <text start="192.95" dur="4.26">a number of hours at all linky student</text>
  <text start="195.05" dur="4.11">with long dark hair approached me his</text>
  <text start="197.21" dur="3.48">narrow face packed with a black go team</text>
  <text start="199.16" dur="4.05">could not hide his wide grin as he</text>
  <text start="200.69" dur="4.53">thrusts out his hand shake mine I really</text>
  <text start="203.21" dur="3.15">enjoyed your preaching Daniel I was</text>
  <text start="205.22" dur="3.15">wondering if you&amp;#39;d like to visit a</text>
  <text start="206.36" dur="5.34">messianic jewish congregation I attempt</text>
  <text start="208.37" dur="5.64">my jaw dropped let&amp;#39;s shook his hand well</text>
  <text start="211.7" dur="3.69">actually that sounds wonderful I just</text>
  <text start="214.01" dur="3.72">got thrown out of a church and even</text>
  <text start="215.39" dur="4.14">looking for someplace new most bumps</text>
  <text start="217.73" dur="6.66">coupled my arms for I knew this was no</text>
  <text start="219.53" dur="7.5">chance Messiah was leading exactly</text>
  <text start="224.39" dur="4.08">great we meet on Saturday afternoons and</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="3.539">saturday evenings here are the</text>
  <text start="228.47" dur="4.08">directions handed me a piece of paper</text>
  <text start="230.569" dur="4.291">with the instructions I turned to my</text>
  <text start="232.55" dur="5.4">wife who looked at me dubiously Jewish</text>
  <text start="234.86" dur="4.62">Church well we aren&amp;#39;t messianic we</text>
  <text start="237.95" dur="3.69">believe in Jesus the student assured us</text>
  <text start="239.48" dur="5.31">but we also explore the Hebrew roots and</text>
  <text start="241.64" dur="5.819">faith I recalled from years ago just as</text>
  <text start="244.79" dur="5.04">a little child my mom would pull out</text>
  <text start="247.459" dur="4.411">Messianic Jewish records in fact I</text>
  <text start="249.83" dur="3.75">vividly remember a faded blue star of</text>
  <text start="251.87" dur="3.63">david etched on the cover of one album</text>
  <text start="253.58" dur="3.51">then there were the many nights when I</text>
  <text start="255.5" dur="3.09">family crowded around our television and</text>
  <text start="257.09" dur="4.89">watched and re-watched our all-time</text>
  <text start="258.59" dur="5.1">favorite musical fiddler on the roof we</text>
  <text start="261.98" dur="4.32">have to go to this place honey I said to</text>
  <text start="263.69" dur="4.17">my wife this is our next step that</text>
  <text start="266.3" dur="4.05">Saturday evening I stepped into a</text>
  <text start="267.86" dur="4.68">completely different world the dimly lit</text>
  <text start="270.35" dur="4.68">auditorium could not hide the bright joy</text>
  <text start="272.54" dur="3.99">in many of the faces as my wife and I</text>
  <text start="275.03" dur="3.48">took our seats on the plush chairs</text>
  <text start="276.53" dur="4.98">wedging the baby stroller between us I</text>
  <text start="278.51" dur="4.14">looked over an all-out the dancers I had</text>
  <text start="281.51" dur="2.88">been that many different types of</text>
  <text start="282.65" dur="3.78">churches but never had I seen a line of</text>
  <text start="284.39" dur="4.26">dancers so coordinated and fluid and</text>
  <text start="286.43" dur="3.81">heartbreakingly beautiful the minor</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="4.2">chords of Hebrew music filled the</text>
  <text start="290.24" dur="4.71">sanctuary and to my astonishment a short</text>
  <text start="292.85" dur="5.43">man with spectacles lifted a long curved</text>
  <text start="294.95" dur="5.91">horn to his lips what was that thing as</text>
  <text start="298.28" dur="4.47">the horn peeled across the sanctuary you</text>
  <text start="300.86" dur="4.26">could feel the weight of the Spirit move</text>
  <text start="302.75" dur="6.09">across the room I would later learn that</text>
  <text start="305.12" dur="5.43">the pastor was blowing a shofar after</text>
  <text start="308.84" dur="3.69">the intense time of worship and a brief</text>
  <text start="310.55" dur="3.929">message the congregation hurried into a</text>
  <text start="312.53" dur="4.41">large basement where oh dang is served</text>
  <text start="314.479" dur="4.291">this was actually a fancy Jewish word to</text>
  <text start="316.94" dur="4.229">describe a lavish meal to either</text>
  <text start="318.77" dur="3.43">celebrate or in this case conclude the</text>
  <text start="321.169" dur="3.281">Sabbath day</text>
  <text start="322.2" dur="5.46">there seemed to be such a love such joy</text>
  <text start="324.45" dur="5.16">such deep peace asad Jewish set up but I</text>
  <text start="327.66" dur="4.74">knew beyond a shadow of a doubt we have</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="4.83">found our new church home a few days</text>
  <text start="332.4" dur="4.2">later a traveling messianic teacher was</text>
  <text start="334.44" dur="4.68">hosting a special midweek conference at</text>
  <text start="336.6" dur="4.89">the very same congregation I told Annika</text>
  <text start="339.12" dur="4.32">we had to go and invited Deanna along</text>
  <text start="341.49" dur="4.5">with her 28 year old son Phillip to join</text>
  <text start="343.44" dur="3.72">us after another time of intense praise</text>
  <text start="345.99" dur="3.18">in worship I could see the glow</text>
  <text start="347.16" dur="4.41">reflected in Vienna and Philips faces</text>
  <text start="349.17" dur="4.83">they knew the spirit which I would soon</text>
  <text start="351.57" dur="5.04">learn could be called the Ruach was also</text>

  <text start="358.08" dur="4.68">funny-looking blue tassels took the</text>
  <text start="360.21" dur="5.31">stage and began bit by bit demolishing</text>
  <text start="362.76" dur="6.06">everything I had ever learned using</text>
  <text start="365.52" dur="5.67">Matthew 5 17 to 21 as the cornerstone of</text>

  <text start="371.19" dur="4.44">showed that the poor and profits are</text>
  <text start="373.38" dur="4.29">still just as relevant today as they</text>
  <text start="375.63" dur="4.98">were when handed down to Moses thousands</text>
  <text start="377.67" dur="5.61">of years ago for the very first time I</text>
  <text start="380.61" dur="5.07">began to see how the Levitical law fit</text>
  <text start="383.28" dur="4.53">perfectly with what Jesus now I would</text>
  <text start="385.68" dur="4.77">learn was called Yahshua taught and</text>

  <text start="390.45" dur="4.08">Easter and Christmas and began</text>
  <text start="392.22" dur="4.92">celebrating and began elaborating on the</text>
  <text start="394.53" dur="4.91">feast days found at Leviticus 23 with</text>
  <text start="397.14" dur="4.62">Joshua and all</text>

  <text start="405.6" dur="4.08">here my entire theological upbringing</text>
  <text start="407.88" dur="3.9">was crumbling to pieces all around me</text>
  <text start="409.68" dur="3.96">yet I felt such a thrill at stepping</text>
  <text start="411.78" dur="4.74">Adamek matrix and truly having my eyes</text>
  <text start="413.64" dur="5.1">open but nothing else mattered this is</text>
  <text start="416.52" dur="4.11">what I had been seeking this was the new</text>
  <text start="418.74" dur="2.87">wine that I had been begging for a few</text>
  <text start="420.63" dur="3.65">months ago</text>
  <text start="421.61" dur="5.339">and ironically this new wine was nothing</text>
  <text start="424.28" dur="4.889">more than Jeremiah&amp;#39;s plea return to the</text>
  <text start="426.949" dur="5.37">ancient paths for there in you shall</text>
  <text start="429.169" dur="4.47">find rest when the teacher had finished</text>
  <text start="432.319" dur="3.181">that first night and the lights</text>
  <text start="433.639" dur="4.201">brightened I could see a troubled look</text>
  <text start="435.5" dur="4.65">of anxiety on the faces of my wife Diana</text>
  <text start="437.84" dur="4.829">and her son evidently they were far more</text>
  <text start="440.15" dur="4.35">troubled by what we had heard as I</text>
  <text start="442.669" dur="3.451">excitedly grabbed my wife&amp;#39;s hand pulling</text>
  <text start="444.5" dur="3.06">her through the crowded sanctuary toward</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="4.079">the back when they were selling various</text>

  <text start="450.199" dur="4.83">could barely contain my excitement isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="452.569" dur="4.35">this amazing I never even knew about any</text>
  <text start="455.029" dur="4.91">of this stuff but it&amp;#39;s all right there</text>
  <text start="456.919" dur="5.28">right in the Bible I&amp;#39;m just blown away I</text>
  <text start="459.939" dur="4.391">just don&amp;#39;t know about this honey it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.199" dur="4.5">also so different than what we were</text>
  <text start="464.33" dur="4.739">raised with she said unable to shake the</text>
  <text start="466.699" dur="4.56">troubled look from her face I know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.069" dur="4.261">different but it&amp;#39;s true I mean he kept</text>
  <text start="471.259" dur="4.5">using one scripture after another and</text>
  <text start="473.33" dur="3.91">mostly from the New Testament my wife</text>
  <text start="475.759" dur="3.25">couldn&amp;#39;t argue with that</text>
  <text start="477.24" dur="4.59">when we arrived home that night my</text>
  <text start="479.009" dur="5.401">spirit burns at me I know exactly what I</text>
  <text start="481.83" dur="4.32">needed to do yanking open our closet</text>
  <text start="484.41" dur="5.25">door and pulled out all our Christmas</text>

  <text start="490.949" dur="4.681">Christmases mean so she didn&amp;#39;t protest</text>

  <text start="497.19" dur="5.37">Christmas to the sidelines anyway now I</text>
  <text start="499.65" dur="5.07">better understood why armload after</text>

  <text start="504.72" dur="4.56">christmas décor into our dumpster as I</text>
  <text start="507.389" dur="4.02">did so I only felt more of the Ruach</text>
  <text start="509.28" dur="4.619">burning brighter and hotter within me I</text>
  <text start="511.409" dur="5.461">knew I was placing a smile of joy on my</text>

  <text start="527.43" dur="3.63">would learn that Deanna called by the</text>
  <text start="529.17" dur="3.6">spirit would begin attending this very</text>
  <text start="531.06" dur="4.469">messianic congregation on a regular</text>
  <text start="532.77" dur="4.62">basis I approached the messianic teacher</text>
  <text start="535.529" dur="3.541">after he finished I waited in line</text>
  <text start="537.39" dur="4.17">chomping at the bit for my turn to speak</text>
  <text start="539.07" dur="4.44">with him Shalom I said for the first</text>

  <text start="546.329" dur="4.5">deeply rich warm voice I explained to</text>
  <text start="549.089" dur="2.911">him about my ministry of doing open-air</text>

  <text start="557.16" dur="5.48">lots to tell those students and thus my</text>
