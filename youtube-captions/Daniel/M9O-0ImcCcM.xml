  <text start="79.74" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;re going to first do is in the four</text>
  <text start="81.689" dur="5.851">corners of the garment I&amp;#39;m going to just</text>
  <text start="84.78" dur="5.22">punch four holes okay I just use my</text>

  <text start="133.84" dur="5.76">least blue in it its numbers 15 chapter</text>
  <text start="137.709" dur="3.811">15 you go to that chapter and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="139.6" dur="3.6">find out that there has to be blue so I</text>
  <text start="141.52" dur="3.63">have blue in it I also put white in it</text>
  <text start="143.2" dur="3.36">just for contrast but you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="145.15" dur="7.85">have the white the only commandment is</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="13.56">blue now i&amp;#39;m going to go ahead and put</text>
  <text start="153" dur="12.16">the ZZ through the hole here okay and</text>
  <text start="160.12" dur="7.32">I&amp;#39;m going to start tying it so that it</text>
  <text start="165.16" dur="3.48">starts looking beautiful so now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167.44" dur="3.54">a lot of different types of knots you</text>
  <text start="168.64" dur="6.75">can do I like to just do this simple one</text>
  <text start="170.98" dur="6.27">okay just so basically a stand or not</text>
  <text start="175.39" dur="4.71">and just keep doing that over and over</text>
  <text start="177.25" dur="5.94">again this does several things not only</text>
  <text start="180.1" dur="5.639">does it look beautiful but it also</text>
  <text start="183.19" dur="3.84">secures it so that you know you never</text>
  <text start="185.739" dur="5.25">gonna have to worry about it coming out</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="7.35">of the Eiffel that I made with the</text>
  <text start="190.989" dur="4.981">scissors now you know there are some</text>
  <text start="194.38" dur="3.27">traditions that Jews fall over they have</text>
  <text start="195.97" dur="4.35">to do a certain not murderous cult you</text>
  <text start="197.65" dur="4.2">okay Bobby that&amp;#39;s just tradition again</text>
  <text start="200.32" dur="6.06">the commandment is simply to put a quart</text>
  <text start="201.85" dur="5.97">of blue so you can be fun and experience</text>
  <text start="206.38" dur="3.72">I have easy that I even have read in</text>
  <text start="207.82" dur="3.72">them but the commandment is you always</text>
  <text start="210.1" dur="3.75">have to make sure there is blue some</text>
  <text start="211.54" dur="5.61">sort of blew it can be any type of blue</text>
  <text start="213.85" dur="5.52">you like blue purple light blue dark</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="6.3">blue if you have any sky blue doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="219.37" dur="6.209">matter just blue because again blue is</text>
  <text start="223.45" dur="6.12">the color of sapphire and sapphire is</text>
  <text start="225.579" dur="6.391">the color of the throne room of yachts</text>
  <text start="229.57" dur="4.259">the color of the floor blue always</text>
  <text start="231.97" dur="4.35">symbolizes heaven so when we put balloon</text>
  <text start="233.829" dur="3.601">rzz that&amp;#39;s putting the Messiah himself</text>
  <text start="236.32" dur="4.02">Joshua</text>
  <text start="237.43" dur="5.25">ZZ this is why the Orthodox Jews they</text>
  <text start="240.34" dur="4.5">follow their own stupid traditions than</text>
  <text start="242.68" dur="4.589">a lot of them do not put blue and</text>
  <text start="244.84" dur="5.479">there&amp;#39;s easy because they&amp;#39;re not obeying</text>
  <text start="247.269" dur="5.461">Torah they&amp;#39;re not falling on the science</text>
  <text start="250.319" dur="3.881">although there are some juice you do so</text>
  <text start="252.73" dur="3.42">like I know the care act&amp;#39;s put blue in</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="3.059">theirs and there there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="2.67">Orthodox shoes that are starting to</text>
  <text start="257.259" dur="4.41">because they&amp;#39;ve actually found the snail</text>
  <text start="258.82" dur="5.219">if they think they need to make the blue</text>
  <text start="261.669" dur="4.291">dye which the whole myth about having to</text>
  <text start="264.039" dur="4.47">have blue dye from a snail that is</text>
  <text start="265.96" dur="4.829">extinct with david has gotten some more</text>
  <text start="268.509" dur="3.69">of the snails but that&amp;#39;s ridiculous okay</text>
  <text start="270.789" dur="2.551">they were given this commandment when</text>
  <text start="272.199" dur="2.551">they were in the wilderness and bleeding</text>
  <text start="273.34" dur="3.389">there were no snails in the desert</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="4.229">assignment so it&amp;#39;s just a stupid man</text>
  <text start="276.729" dur="4.951">tradition of the rabbi&amp;#39;s may do not</text>
  <text start="278.979" dur="4.62">you&amp;#39;ve torn up but you just put blue in</text>
