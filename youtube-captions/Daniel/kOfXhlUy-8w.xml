  <text start="52.829" dur="5.75">forerunner to the tabernacle of the</text>
  <text start="55.8" dur="6">congregation attempt of meeting the the</text>
  <text start="58.579" dur="7.211">tabernacle tabernacle of Moses we all</text>
  <text start="61.8" dur="8.91">know in Exodus chapter 40 we&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="65.79" dur="7.59">new moon Yahshua spoke unto Moshe and he</text>
  <text start="70.71" dur="4.199">had them basically set up the tabernacle</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="4.919">of congregation the tabernacle of</text>
  <text start="74.909" dur="5.551">meeting and they put all the all the</text>
  <text start="78.299" dur="3.331">holy vessels inside the temple at that</text>
  <text start="80.46" dur="4.979">point they put the Ark of the Covenant</text>
  <text start="81.63" dur="6.419">inside and the table of showbread and</text>
  <text start="85.439" dur="5.101">the menorah all the vessels that had</text>
  <text start="88.049" dur="5.151">been prepared we&amp;#39;re now finally put in</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="5.78">this tent of meeting it was ready to be</text>
  <text start="93.2" dur="6.279">fully functional in Exodus chapter 40</text>
  <text start="96.32" dur="5.92">but how many of you know that there was</text>
  <text start="99.479" dur="5.491">a forerunner there was a precursor to</text>
  <text start="102.24" dur="6.87">this tent of meeting this tabernacle of</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="7.71">congregation if you flip back a few</text>
  <text start="109.11" dur="5.28">chapters to Exodus chapter 33 this is</text>
  <text start="112.68" dur="3.6">just after Moshe had spent some time up</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="3.99">on the mountain and the children of</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="4.74">Israel had been in rebellion you know at</text>
  <text start="118.38" dur="4.529">the whole Golden Calf incident and the</text>
  <text start="121.02" dur="5.16">children of Israel in general were being</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="5.58">very stiff-necked and rebellious and if</text>
  <text start="126.18" dur="5.82">you started in verse 7 Exodus 33</text>
  <text start="128.489" dur="5.731">starting in verse 7 it all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="132" dur="6.39">says and Moshe took the tap</text>
  <text start="134.22" dur="6.99">and pitched it without the camp afar off</text>
  <text start="138.39" dur="5">from the congregation and called it the</text>
  <text start="141.21" dur="4.77">tabernacle of the congregation and</text>
  <text start="143.39" dur="5.56">became to pass that everyone which saw</text>
  <text start="145.98" dur="5.57">Yahweh went out unto the tabernacle the</text>
  <text start="148.95" dur="4.95">congregation which was without the camp</text>
  <text start="151.55" dur="4.45">so notice it&amp;#39;s called the same thing as</text>
  <text start="153.9" dur="3.96">it is and eventually as in Exodus 40 the</text>
  <text start="156" dur="5.37">tabernacle congregation or the tent of</text>
  <text start="157.86" dur="6.3">meeting but this is before the Ark of</text>
  <text start="161.37" dur="5.04">the Covenant or the menorah or the show</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="4.8">table of showbread or any of that has</text>
  <text start="166.41" dur="5.09">been placed inside this is before the</text>
  <text start="168.96" dur="5.49">Levitical priesthood is officiating the</text>
  <text start="171.5" dur="7.72">temple service this is before all that</text>
  <text start="174.45" dur="6.87">and continuing on in verse 8 and it came</text>
  <text start="179.22" dur="3.6">to pass when Moshe went out unto the</text>
  <text start="181.32" dur="4.08">tabernacle that all the people rose up</text>
  <text start="182.82" dur="4.59">and stood every man at his tent door and</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="4.74">looked after Moshe until he was gone</text>
  <text start="187.41" dur="4.26">into the tabernacle and it came to pass</text>
  <text start="190.14" dur="4.17">as ma che entered into the tabernacle</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="4.56">the cloudy pillar descended and stood at</text>
  <text start="194.31" dur="5.1">the door of the tabernacle and Yahweh</text>
  <text start="196.23" dur="4.65">talked with Moshe and all the people saw</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="3.78">the cloudy pillar stand at the</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="4.98">tabernacle door and all the people rose</text>
  <text start="203.19" dur="5.82">up and worshiped every men man in his</text>
  <text start="205.86" dur="5.159">tent door and Yahweh spake unto Moshe a</text>
  <text start="209.01" dur="4.949">face to face as a man speaks into his</text>
  <text start="211.019" dur="5.22">friend and he turned again into the camp</text>
  <text start="213.959" dur="4.711">but a servant Joshua the son of nun a</text>
  <text start="216.239" dur="6.75">young man departed not out of the</text>
  <text start="218.67" dur="6.09">tabernacle so Moshe took this tent of</text>
  <text start="222.989" dur="3.421">congregation this Tabernacle this tent</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="5.58">of meeting he took it outside the camp</text>
  <text start="226.41" dur="5.609">and in verse 7 it says and anyone which</text>
  <text start="230.34" dur="3.39">sought Yahweh went out unto this</text>
  <text start="232.019" dur="4.591">tabernacle congregation to get alone</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="5.07">with Yahweh and when Moshe went out</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="4.71">there the cloudy pillar of yaws presence</text>
  <text start="238.8" dur="7.38">actually descended Joshua would stay in</text>
  <text start="241.32" dur="7.53">there long after Moshe had left Moshe</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="6.33">and Joshua understood how important it</text>
  <text start="248.85" dur="7.56">was to get away from everything and just</text>
  <text start="252.51" dur="6.719">spend time with yah to cultivate his</text>
  <text start="256.41" dur="6.84">presence in their lives so that they</text>
  <text start="259.229" dur="6.961">would have the leadership ability the</text>
  <text start="263.25" dur="4.44">wisdom to know what to do in bringing</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="2.67">the children of Israel</text>
  <text start="267.69" dur="6">through the wilderness and to the</text>
  <text start="268.86" dur="6.69">promised land the reason I&amp;#39;m directing</text>
  <text start="273.69" dur="6.06">this message towards Messianics is that</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="7.71">you know if you&amp;#39;re doing all the stuff</text>
  <text start="279.75" dur="5.55">with Torah wearing the seeds eat keeping</text>
  <text start="283.26" dur="3.99">Shabbat keeping the feast days eating</text>
  <text start="285.3" dur="3.69">kosher which are all very good these</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="4.95">certain things we need to be doing these</text>
  <text start="288.99" dur="7.53">are Commandments but if you&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="9.18">without the presence of Yahweh it</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="8.22">doesn&amp;#39;t work it doesn&amp;#39;t work even here</text>
  <text start="301.38" dur="5.94">in the second book of the Torah before</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="4.26">the tabernacle a congregation was fully</text>
  <text start="307.32" dur="6.69">functional before it was placed in the</text>
  <text start="309" dur="6.78">center of all the twelve tribes with the</text>
  <text start="314.01" dur="3.21">Ark of the Covenant and with the table</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="3.12">of showbread and with the menorah and</text>
  <text start="317.22" dur="4.65">with the different altars and with the</text>
  <text start="318.9" dur="7.77">Levitical priesthood before that was</text>
  <text start="321.87" dur="6.72">done Moshe took the original tent of</text>
  <text start="326.67" dur="5.97">congregation and pitched it outside the</text>
  <text start="328.59" dur="8.52">camp and it was just a place to get</text>
  <text start="332.64" dur="7.16">alone with yah to have his presence you</text>
  <text start="337.11" dur="6.51">have to have his presence in your life</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="7.96">you have to be spending time with him in</text>
  <text start="343.62" dur="8.4">order for the Torah to have any meaning</text>
  <text start="347.76" dur="9.75">or significance in order for this to</text>
  <text start="352.02" dur="7.26">work it&amp;#39;s extremely important and you</text>
  <text start="357.51" dur="3.18">say well you know my schedule is really</text>
  <text start="359.28" dur="3.78">busy and I don&amp;#39;t know if I have time to</text>
  <text start="360.69" dur="6.3">just spend with ya all you have to make</text>
  <text start="363.06" dur="6.9">time but also what&amp;#39;s very important is</text>
  <text start="366.99" dur="5.67">even if you you have a busy schedule you</text>
  <text start="369.96" dur="6.54">know throughout the day whatever you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="372.66" dur="5.94">doing are you conversing with yah are</text>
  <text start="376.5" dur="4.2">you talking with him thanking him for</text>
  <text start="378.6" dur="6.03">the good things that are happening in</text>
  <text start="380.7" dur="8.07">your life as they happen scripture says</text>
  <text start="384.63" dur="5.91">all good things come from above if</text>
  <text start="388.77" dur="4.35">you&amp;#39;ve ever seen the movie fiddler on</text>
  <text start="390.54" dur="4.74">the roof the main character and that in</text>
  <text start="393.12" dur="3.82">that movie Tevye he&amp;#39;s always talking</text>
  <text start="395.28" dur="4.99">with the Almighty</text>
  <text start="396.94" dur="5.96">and I think that&amp;#39;s a very very important</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="5.31">thing that we all need to be doing</text>
  <text start="402.9" dur="6.45">talking with him throughout the day no</text>
  <text start="405.58" dur="6">matter how busy our schedule may get</text>
  <text start="409.35" dur="5.35">it&amp;#39;s very important that we cultivate</text>
  <text start="411.58" dur="5.94">his presence in our lives so that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="414.7" dur="4.68">not just going through the motions we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="417.52" dur="3.66">not just you know keeping Shabbat we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="419.38" dur="3.42">not just eating kosher we&amp;#39;re not just</text>
  <text start="421.18" dur="3.48">doing these things because you know</text>
  <text start="422.8" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;ve learned that these are good things</text>
  <text start="424.66" dur="4.47">that we should be doing but but in fact</text>
  <text start="426.7" dur="6.54">when we have the presence of yah in our</text>
  <text start="429.13" dur="5.28">lives which you know a lot of Christians</text>
  <text start="433.24" dur="2.34">they understand</text>
  <text start="434.41" dur="2.67">oh how important it is to get the</text>
  <text start="435.58" dur="3.9">presence but then they totally ignore</text>
  <text start="437.08" dur="5.06">the Torah and so then you go into a</text>
  <text start="439.48" dur="5.43">direction that you don&amp;#39;t want to go into</text>
  <text start="442.14" dur="5.05">but s Messianics we can tend to get so</text>
  <text start="444.91" dur="5.04">focused on the tour that we forget about</text>
  <text start="447.19" dur="5.12">how we need that presence of Yahshua in</text>
  <text start="449.95" dur="4.71">our lives</text>
  <text start="452.31" dur="5.65">and I think it&amp;#39;s very very important</text>
  <text start="454.66" dur="6.9">that we cultivate his presence in our</text>
  <text start="457.96" dur="6.57">lives if mo che and Yehoshua the son of</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="6.11">nun realize the importance of getting</text>
  <text start="464.53" dur="7.73">outside the camp and seeking yah</text>
  <text start="467.67" dur="7.36">face-to-face if they understood that</text>
  <text start="472.26" dur="6.43">then we need to understand that as well</text>
  <text start="475.03" dur="6.57">as the Apostle Paul said these things</text>
  <text start="478.69" dur="5.67">that are written in the Torah they were</text>
  <text start="481.6" dur="4.5">written for our example our edification</text>
  <text start="484.36" dur="6.93">our witness that we would understand</text>
  <text start="486.1" dur="7.02">these things for the last days so I pray</text>
  <text start="491.29" dur="4.44">that this message is touched you and</text>
  <text start="493.12" dur="3.42">ministered to you and I encourage you on</text>
  <text start="495.73" dur="6.32">this Shabbat</text>
  <text start="496.54" dur="7.65">to meditate on Exodus 33 in Exodus 40</text>
  <text start="502.05" dur="4.51">that there was a precursor to the</text>
