  <text start="11.19" dur="5.429">midweek podcast I like to do my podcast</text>
  <text start="14.639" dur="3.241">outside I&amp;#39;ve been able to do them</text>
  <text start="16.619" dur="4.261">outside the last few times but</text>
  <text start="17.88" dur="6.33">unfortunately because I live in portland</text>
  <text start="20.88" dur="6.69">oregon today it is raining so i won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="24.21" dur="5.67">able to go outside and record but i want</text>
  <text start="27.57" dur="5.55">to do to kind of go over a very special</text>
  <text start="29.88" dur="6.199">podcast today on a topic that I think</text>
  <text start="33.12" dur="6.02">affects all of us particularly if we are</text>
  <text start="36.079" dur="5.261">individuals who are endeavouring to</text>
  <text start="39.14" dur="4.9">follow the Bible and apply it to our</text>
  <text start="41.34" dur="3.989">lives oh and before I go in today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="44.04" dur="3.39">teaching I just want to let everyone</text>
  <text start="45.329" dur="3.96">know that the reason I don&amp;#39;t have a head</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="3.75">covering on is not because I&amp;#39;ve changed</text>
  <text start="49.289" dur="5.04">my view on the head covering it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="51.18" dur="5.699">because I&amp;#39;m waiting for my head covering</text>
  <text start="54.329" dur="5.25">along with all my other possessions to</text>
  <text start="56.879" dur="6.331">get shipped down from Alaska to Oregon</text>
  <text start="59.579" dur="5.931">and as soon as I get that down here i</text>
  <text start="63.21" dur="8.79">will be wearing my head covering again</text>
  <text start="65.51" dur="10.929">um in in psalm 119 the longest song in</text>
  <text start="72" dur="7.65">the Bible several times David makes a</text>
  <text start="76.439" dur="6.301">statement where he says I will keep your</text>
  <text start="79.65" dur="7.829">Torah I will delight myself in your</text>
  <text start="82.74" dur="9.12">commandments which I love I will keep</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="8.131">your Commandments I will observe your</text>
  <text start="91.86" dur="6.03">statutes continually over and over again</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="8.28">he makes this statement all through</text>
  <text start="97.89" dur="9.75">psalm 119 and what I want to encourage</text>
  <text start="103.89" dur="6.439">everyone is this there&amp;#39;s this pervading</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="4.68">sense in America and in America</text>
  <text start="110.329" dur="4.811">churchianity and even within the</text>
  <text start="112.32" dur="4.649">Messianic movement that somehow the</text>
  <text start="115.14" dur="6.119">commandments that are given to us in the</text>
  <text start="116.969" dur="7.171">Torah or too hard for us to obey and</text>
  <text start="121.259" dur="7.051">that&amp;#39;s why we have the blood of Yahshua</text>
  <text start="124.14" dur="5.97">because he excuses us from our obedience</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="4.29">and</text>
  <text start="130.11" dur="4.8">and the father sort of looks at us with</text>
  <text start="132.6" dur="4.56">these rose-colored glasses and all a</text>
  <text start="134.91" dur="4.05">sees is the Messiah and the blood and</text>
  <text start="137.16" dur="5.19">and does not see air disobedience and</text>
  <text start="138.96" dur="5.79">that that is just not true that is just</text>
  <text start="142.35" dur="8.72">not true the commandments that Yahweh</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="9.11">gave us our are easily able to be kept</text>
  <text start="151.07" dur="5.59">particularly if one loves the Messiah</text>
  <text start="153.86" dur="8.17">and I can prove this through reading</text>
  <text start="156.66" dur="8.49">Deuteronomy chapter 30 in which Moshe</text>
  <text start="162.03" dur="4.14">has just given the entire Torah to the</text>
  <text start="165.15" dur="4.76">children of Israel he&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="7.38">repeated the Torah for the second time</text>
  <text start="169.91" dur="5.17">telling them to keep the Torah and it</text>
  <text start="173.55" dur="3.84">says for this commandment starting in</text>
  <text start="175.08" dur="6.27">verse 11 it says for this commandment</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="6.63">referring to the Torah to the 613 some</text>
  <text start="181.35" dur="5.19">odd laws in Torah which I command you</text>
  <text start="184.02" dur="4.68">today is not too mysterious for you nor</text>
  <text start="186.54" dur="3.51">is it far off it is not in heaven that</text>
  <text start="188.7" dur="3.06">you should say who will ascend into</text>
  <text start="190.05" dur="4.17">heaven for us and bring it to us that we</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="4.59">may hear it and do it nor is it beyond</text>
  <text start="194.22" dur="3.989">the sea that you should say who will go</text>
  <text start="196.35" dur="3.72">over the sea for us and bring it to us</text>
  <text start="198.209" dur="3.84">that we may hear it and do it but the</text>
  <text start="200.07" dur="6.36">word is very near you in your mouth and</text>
  <text start="202.049" dur="7.801">in your heart that you may do it so very</text>
  <text start="206.43" dur="6.66">clearly in Deuteronomy chapter 30 Yahweh</text>
  <text start="209.85" dur="6.09">makes it clear that you may do this</text>
  <text start="213.09" dur="5.82">Torah but you can do these Commandments</text>
  <text start="215.94" dur="5.82">every commandment given in the Torah is</text>
  <text start="218.91" dur="5.25">not only possible to be done but it</text>
  <text start="221.76" dur="4.77">brings untold blessings when you obey</text>
  <text start="224.16" dur="4.71">the kosher laws the dietary laws in</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="4.88">Leviticus chapter 11 you don&amp;#39;t eat pork</text>
  <text start="228.87" dur="5.22">and shellfish you don&amp;#39;t eat the blood</text>
  <text start="231.41" dur="4.42">these Commandments when you keep them</text>
  <text start="234.09" dur="5.49">they allow you to live a longer and a</text>
  <text start="235.83" dur="5.159">healthier life when you keep the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="239.58" dur="4.11">day from Friday night to Saturday night</text>
  <text start="240.989" dur="4.731">this blesses your life and keeps you</text>
  <text start="243.69" dur="4.56">from getting burned out keeps you from</text>
  <text start="245.72" dur="4.18">stress that can bring all sorts of</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="4.17">sicknesses and problems to your body</text>
  <text start="249.9" dur="4.47">when you wear clothing of one hundred</text>
  <text start="252.42" dur="4.05">percent fiber like one hundred percent</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="4.77">cotton it actually strengthens your</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="4.379">immunity system every single commandment</text>
  <text start="259.14" dur="3.57">in the scriptures when you apply it to</text>
  <text start="260.849" dur="5.88">your lives it brings you blessing</text>
  <text start="262.71" dur="6.81">these Commandments are possible to be</text>
  <text start="266.729" dur="4.321">kept when we love Yahshua we fall in</text>
  <text start="269.52" dur="3.6">love with him and we apply his a blood</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="4.5">atonement to our lives when we keep him</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="4.049">as the center of our lives then all we</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="4.56">want to do is bring a smile to his face</text>
  <text start="277.169" dur="4.891">that&amp;#39;s the other theme that psalm 119 is</text>
  <text start="280.11" dur="3.72">all about is about pleasing yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.06" dur="4.38">about bringing a smile to Yahweh&amp;#39;s faced</text>
  <text start="283.83" dur="4.44">and David understood that the way to</text>
  <text start="286.44" dur="3.449">bring a smile d always face is by</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="3.149">keeping his Commandments that&amp;#39;s why he</text>
  <text start="289.889" dur="3.96">makes the statement over and over again</text>
  <text start="291.419" dur="4.171">I will keep your commitments I will do</text>
  <text start="293.849" dur="3.451">your statutes I will keep your</text>
  <text start="295.59" dur="4.259">Commandments forever and ever I will do</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="4.32">your statutes continually why would they</text>
  <text start="299.849" dur="4.081">even say these things if it were not</text>
  <text start="301.62" dur="4.229">possible for a human being to do them</text>
  <text start="303.93" dur="4.23">well of course he wouldn&amp;#39;t this is a</text>
  <text start="305.849" dur="5.731">psalmist inspired by the Holy Spirit by</text>
  <text start="308.16" dur="6.03">the rococo douche David understood that</text>
  <text start="311.58" dur="5.25">these Commandments are our gold precious</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="4.38">gold sweeter than honey more precious</text>
  <text start="316.83" dur="3.54">than gold and silver and that to do</text>
  <text start="318.57" dur="4.68">these commands brings a smile d always</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="4.74">face so keeping the Sabbath day from</text>
  <text start="323.25" dur="4.229">Friday night to Saturday night observing</text>
  <text start="325.11" dur="4.95">the New Moon&amp;#39;s wearing the ZZ wearing</text>

  <text start="330.06" dur="5.37">days and observing Purim and Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="332.72" dur="4.06">eating kosher all of these commandments</text>
  <text start="335.43" dur="4.44">that you can find throughout the Torah</text>
  <text start="336.78" dur="4.979">these Commandments we need to do and we</text>
  <text start="339.87" dur="4.349">can do them and when we do these</text>
  <text start="341.759" dur="4.771">Commandments they please Yahweh we need</text>
  <text start="344.219" dur="4.5">to stop making excuses about why we</text>
  <text start="346.53" dur="5.72">can&amp;#39;t keep the commandments because</text>
  <text start="348.719" dur="6.57">there is no excuse there is no excuse</text>
  <text start="352.25" dur="5.02">Yahweh designed these Commandments to</text>
  <text start="355.289" dur="4.141">protect us he gave them to us through</text>
  <text start="357.27" dur="5.61">Moses and he ratified them to the blood</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="5.19">of his son so that we can obey them so</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t let anyone don&amp;#39;t let any pastor</text>
  <text start="364.62" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t let any commentary don&amp;#39;t let any</text>
  <text start="366.81" dur="3.96">church leader or any friend convince you</text>
  <text start="369.27" dur="3.6">otherwise don&amp;#39;t let anyone tell you that</text>
  <text start="370.77" dur="4.739">it&amp;#39;s impossible to keep the commandments</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="5.94">of Yahweh because that is a lie you know</text>
  <text start="375.509" dur="6.121">Satan rejoices when people who claim to</text>
  <text start="378.81" dur="4.979">be believers will use the excuse that</text>
  <text start="381.63" dur="3.719">because the blood of Yahshua was shed</text>
  <text start="383.789" dur="3.961">for them they don&amp;#39;t have to keep the</text>
  <text start="385.349" dur="5.19">commandments but that&amp;#39;s why he died no</text>
  <text start="387.75" dur="5.4">Jesus did not die so that we could live</text>
  <text start="390.539" dur="4.981">in rebellion he died and he shed his</text>
  <text start="393.15" dur="3.12">blood so that we would have the freedom</text>
  <text start="395.52" dur="2.61">to obey his</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="3.15">Commandments so that we would no longer</text>
  <text start="398.13" dur="3.93">have to live with a guilty conscience</text>
  <text start="399.42" dur="4.44">and we could have a clear conscience a</text>
  <text start="402.06" dur="3.72">clean conscience rejoicing in his</text>
  <text start="403.86" dur="4.86">Commandments and all of scriptures about</text>
