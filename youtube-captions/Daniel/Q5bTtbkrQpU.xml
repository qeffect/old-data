  <text start="17.34" dur="5.79">quite a harrowing testimony to to share</text>
  <text start="20.43" dur="5.009">and I really like it because you know he</text>
  <text start="23.13" dur="4.5">really shows how Jesus Yahshua delivered</text>

  <text start="27.63" dur="3.87">testimony that to help so many other</text>

  <text start="47.039" dur="6.171">my testimony it&amp;#39;s hard to give you know</text>

  <text start="107.93" dur="5.49">offered me things that that you know</text>
  <text start="110.549" dur="6.451">were against the rules or at least not</text>
  <text start="113.42" dur="5.559">not allowed you know on a regular basis</text>

  <text start="301.53" dur="6.03">hundreds of other children in the same</text>
  <text start="304.76" dur="8.32">in the same place in the same position</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="8.55">basically there was there was hundreds</text>

  <text start="327.65" dur="5.98">conditions we lived in in the basement</text>
  <text start="330.6" dur="9.84">of this hotel the easier it was for them</text>
  <text start="333.63" dur="12.9">to say seasonally sorry about that so it</text>
  <text start="340.44" dur="8.49">continued in late January 1984 just</text>
  <text start="346.53" dur="4.02">after the first of the year it had taken</text>
  <text start="348.93" dur="5.88">me quite some time to try to hitchhike</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="7.11">home I had just a difficult time I got</text>
  <text start="354.81" dur="6">to the most North exit of Redding</text>
  <text start="357.66" dur="6.09">California and I&amp;#39;d been hitchhiking on</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="6.84">the on-ramp for a couple of days when</text>
  <text start="363.75" dur="7.52">this fella started walking down or you</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="5.82">know towards me and my first thought was</text>
  <text start="371.27" dur="6.07">excuse my language</text>
  <text start="373.47" dur="5.22">great another faggot you know and so</text>
  <text start="377.34" dur="4.139">he&amp;#39;s walking towards me</text>
  <text start="378.69" dur="6.66">and I remember thinking well I&amp;#39;m hungry</text>
  <text start="381.479" dur="5.611">you know I&amp;#39;m hungry so if he is and he</text>
  <text start="385.35" dur="3.12">offers and he asked me you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="387.09" dur="5.34">gonna go to lunch I&amp;#39;m gonna go to dinner</text>
  <text start="388.47" dur="7.04">whatever is the offers that&amp;#39;s not who</text>
  <text start="392.43" dur="5.4">this gentleman was his name was Joshua</text>
  <text start="395.51" dur="4.99">he asked me if I wanted to go to coffee</text>
  <text start="397.83" dur="3.809">we went to a cot went and had coffee and</text>
  <text start="400.5" dur="3.719">a sandwich</text>
  <text start="401.639" dur="4.59">at a little place called the lighthouse</text>
  <text start="404.219" dur="5.91">mission it&amp;#39;s still there in North</text>
  <text start="406.229" dur="8.791">Redding California they&amp;#39;re not a shelter</text>
  <text start="410.129" dur="7.621">but they offer a place a place of</text>
  <text start="415.02" dur="5.489">sanctuary a place and I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="417.75" dur="5.219">Joshua worked for this place I think</text>
  <text start="420.509" dur="4.25">that he was to tell you the truth I</text>
  <text start="422.969" dur="5.331">think that he was Jesus Christ himself</text>
  <text start="424.759" dur="7.451">that may be hard for some to believe but</text>
  <text start="428.3" dur="6.69">looking back on it this guy saved my</text>
  <text start="432.21" dur="7.169">soul you know he told me about this guy</text>

  <text start="439.379" dur="6.66">perfect life and and died for my sins</text>
  <text start="443.729" dur="6.271">and not just my sins but the sins</text>
  <text start="446.039" dur="6.541">committed against me and that he offered</text>
  <text start="450" dur="5.029">something that that I couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="452.58" dur="2.449">anywhere else</text>
  <text start="456.029" dur="8.07">I remember February 4th 1984 I remember</text>
  <text start="462.21" dur="4.53">telling Joshua that I needed what he was</text>
  <text start="464.099" dur="4.5">talking about how did I do that and he</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="9.299">Lord led me in the the sinner&amp;#39;s prayer</text>
  <text start="468.599" dur="9.57">and I instantly felt free and and we</text>

  <text start="713.499" dur="5.851">what I knew which was very little except</text>
  <text start="716.829" dur="4.8">for this Jesus you know could save us</text>
  <text start="719.35" dur="3.75">from all this stuff and take away the</text>
  <text start="721.629" dur="4.83">shame and the guilt and the hurt and the</text>
  <text start="723.1" dur="5.279">pain and and whatever caused him to run</text>

  <text start="730.72" dur="4.13">maybe not sexually maybe physically</text>
  <text start="734.91" dur="4.119">there&amp;#39;s lots of different reasons why</text>
  <text start="737.379" dur="3.601">the kids ended up on the streets in the</text>
  <text start="739.029" dur="4.321">Hollywood and and I believe they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="767.11" dur="4.979">handlers freelance handlers if you will</text>
  <text start="770.139" dur="4.7">and I and I say that because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="772.089" dur="5.58">investigated in the last several years</text>

  <text start="781.48" dur="4.109">these guys were I remember getting away</text>
  <text start="783.549" dur="4.95">from him and taken off and I ran up to a</text>
  <text start="785.589" dur="5.61">Los Angeles police officer and my dad</text>
  <text start="788.499" dur="6.96">was a retired police officer and so</text>
  <text start="791.199" dur="6.12">there was a trust level there because he</text>
  <text start="795.459" dur="3.81">was a police officer I expected that he</text>
  <text start="797.319" dur="4.541">was on the side of righteousness and and</text>
  <text start="799.269" dur="5.501">law and order</text>
  <text start="801.86" dur="4.38">and he acted concerned and he said well</text>
  <text start="804.77" dur="4.29">let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s see what we can do about</text>
  <text start="806.24" dur="4.53">this and said getting back at my car and</text>
  <text start="809.06" dur="3.78">he opens the door and I climb in all</text>
  <text start="810.77" dur="3.84">excited because we&amp;#39;re gonna stop this</text>
  <text start="812.84" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re gonna end this all the bad people</text>
  <text start="814.61" dur="3.06">are gonna get in trouble now do you know</text>
  <text start="817.13" dur="6.27">what I mean</text>
  <text start="817.67" dur="9.39">that&amp;#39;s how I thought I ended up within a</text>
  <text start="823.4" dur="7.95">short time I got I got drugged I was</text>
  <text start="827.06" dur="6.99">taken out of the car by some people that</text>
  <text start="831.35" dur="5.58">police officer basically turned me over</text>
  <text start="834.05" dur="5.07">to this gentleman and I believe his name</text>
  <text start="836.93" dur="5.52">was Ricardo but I do remember that he</text>
  <text start="839.12" dur="9">was a federal judge in Los Angeles</text>
  <text start="842.45" dur="10.47">California and I woke up in a cage and</text>
  <text start="848.12" dur="10.52">he owned me and I I don&amp;#39;t remember if he</text>
  <text start="852.92" dur="10.89">ever abused me or not I I don&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="858.64" dur="7.66">but I but I do remember the feeling of</text>
  <text start="863.81" dur="5.04">protection and that I hung on to that</text>
  <text start="866.3" dur="4.76">Jesus I hung on to it with everything I</text>
  <text start="868.85" dur="2.21">had</text>
  <text start="871.93" dur="5.86">but I was very defiant I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="874.43" dur="6.65">cooperative I no longer was I gonna say</text>
  <text start="877.79" dur="3.29">okay sure go ahead</text>
  <text start="882.38" dur="9.69">I I remember again being drugged and I</text>
  <text start="888.76" dur="8.38">ended up I I woke up in a new place and</text>
  <text start="892.07" dur="8.25">there was probably I don&amp;#39;t know 25 or 30</text>
  <text start="897.14" dur="4.8">other kids all in cages big padlocks on</text>
  <text start="900.32" dur="3.21">them and these aren&amp;#39;t like the kennels</text>
  <text start="901.94" dur="8.7">you go by at Walmart for your bull</text>
  <text start="903.53" dur="9.15">mastiff these are iron built strong</text>
  <text start="910.64" dur="5.64">cages we didn&amp;#39;t have enough room to</text>
  <text start="912.68" dur="5.1">stand up in them barely enough for him</text>
  <text start="916.28" dur="9.8">to lay down definitely not room to</text>
  <text start="917.78" dur="11.45">stretch out at all and and there was</text>
  <text start="926.08" dur="6.11">another kid right around our age and he</text>
  <text start="929.23" dur="5.34">wasn&amp;#39;t in a cage and he would chime in</text>
  <text start="932.19" dur="5.05">you know I don&amp;#39;t remember three or four</text>
  <text start="934.57" dur="5.13">times a day I it we were in the dark I I</text>
  <text start="937.24" dur="3.84">didn&amp;#39;t know when it was daytime or</text>
  <text start="939.7" dur="5.25">nighttime so I don&amp;#39;t know how many days</text>
  <text start="941.08" dur="6.09">passed while I was here but I I know</text>
  <text start="944.95" dur="5.37">that he came in and he would feed us all</text>
  <text start="947.17" dur="6.75">he would give us all a paper plate with</text>
  <text start="950.32" dur="7.139">food on it and I had a little cart you</text>
  <text start="953.92" dur="6.24">know and and the best way I can describe</text>
  <text start="957.459" dur="5.851">this kid as a trustee you know he had</text>
  <text start="960.16" dur="6.06">gained their trust I imagine that he had</text>
  <text start="963.31" dur="5.76">been abused and had gotten to a point</text>
  <text start="966.22" dur="7.369">where he had reconciled to it where he</text>
  <text start="969.07" dur="4.519">just expected this was now the norm</text>
  <text start="974.16" dur="6.34">anyway I remember asking this kid if he</text>
  <text start="976.87" dur="8.45">knew Jesus if he knew about Jesus and he</text>
  <text start="980.5" dur="7.35">said no there&amp;#39;s no Jesus here and I</text>
  <text start="985.32" dur="4.18">think it was shortly thereafter he</text>
  <text start="987.85" dur="7.049">brought me a plate of food like he had</text>
  <text start="989.5" dur="8.94">you know often and I said how can you be</text>
  <text start="994.899" dur="5.491">doing this you know you&amp;#39;re one of us and</text>
  <text start="998.44" dur="7.889">he said he gave me my plate of food and</text>
  <text start="1000.39" dur="8.819">said don&amp;#39;t eat this and and I said what</text>
  <text start="1006.329" dur="6.51">and he said don&amp;#39;t eat this this is how</text>
  <text start="1009.209" dur="8.701">they&amp;#39;re controlling you and so I stopped</text>
  <text start="1012.839" dur="6.99">eating and it was probably nine times of</text>
  <text start="1017.91" dur="4.77">him bringing me a plate of food don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1019.829" dur="5.691">eat this he would say and then I started</text>
  <text start="1022.68" dur="5.58">to get my faculties back and I could I</text>
  <text start="1025.52" dur="9.059">could see more I could understand more I</text>
  <text start="1028.26" dur="11.1">could perceive more and one one time he</text>
  <text start="1034.579" dur="6.941">came and he unlocked my cage and he gave</text>
  <text start="1039.36" dur="2.76">me explicit directions on how to get out</text>
  <text start="1041.52" dur="2.49">of the building</text>
  <text start="1042.12" dur="5.459">and he said there&amp;#39;s a blue car out front</text>
  <text start="1044.01" dur="8.28">with the keys in it good luck don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="1047.579" dur="7.861">anybody I helped you so I made my way</text>
  <text start="1052.29" dur="3.78">out of the out of the cage out of the</text>
  <text start="1055.44" dur="4.14">building</text>
  <text start="1056.07" dur="5.19">I found that blue car and I learned</text>
  <text start="1059.58" dur="3.72">how to drive leave in that parking lot</text>
  <text start="1061.26" dur="4.53">he had a few cars there was people</text>
  <text start="1063.3" dur="6.71">running behind me as I was driving out</text>
  <text start="1065.79" dur="6.99">of this parking lot and I seriously</text>
  <text start="1070.01" dur="4.33">literally the only the only kind of</text>
  <text start="1072.78" dur="3.15">driving training I had after till then</text>
  <text start="1074.34" dur="4.29">was watching my dad drive from the</text>
  <text start="1075.93" dur="7.25">passenger seat or from the back seat so</text>
  <text start="1078.63" dur="7.5">I learned how to drive 1974 formula</text>
  <text start="1083.18" dur="5.59">Firebird on the way out of that parking</text>
  <text start="1086.13" dur="7.62">lot and for the next several blocks</text>
  <text start="1088.77" dur="6.45">I found an interstate and it said West</text>
  <text start="1093.75" dur="5.87">and I got on it</text>
  <text start="1095.22" dur="7.17">and I started going I remember I</text>
  <text start="1099.62" dur="3.22">remember knowing that I could not trust</text>
  <text start="1102.39" dur="3.87">the police</text>
  <text start="1102.84" dur="7.02">I could not get pulled over no matter</text>
  <text start="1106.26" dur="6.24">what I would pull over behind gas</text>
  <text start="1109.86" dur="7.08">stations during the day and and sleep</text>
  <text start="1112.5" dur="6.3">sometimes into bushes off the road and I</text>
  <text start="1116.94" dur="5.91">would sleep try to sleep during the day</text>
  <text start="1118.8" dur="6.33">and do most of my driving at night I</text>
  <text start="1122.85" dur="7.05">found an envelope full of money in the</text>
  <text start="1125.13" dur="6.18">car that probably that kid arranged you</text>
  <text start="1129.9" dur="4.11">know figured out how to get some money</text>
  <text start="1131.31" dur="7.8">and put it in the car I believe that to</text>

  <text start="1792.61" dur="5.169">laughter you know from being born again</text>
  <text start="1794.6" dur="5.34">amen so well the reason I was asking is</text>
  <text start="1797.779" dur="4.351">because last fall I interviewed Aaron</text>
  <text start="1799.94" dur="6.359">Golub and when he was he was a young man</text>
  <text start="1802.13" dur="8.039">a little boy in the in the 1970s and he</text>
  <text start="1806.299" dur="7.38">was trafficked in the tunnel that was</text>
  <text start="1810.169" dur="5.821">beneath the Freemason Lodge in DC and he</text>
  <text start="1813.679" dur="4.671">he was put through the tunnels with a</text>
  <text start="1815.99" dur="5.64">bunch of other children that connected</text>
  <text start="1818.35" dur="5.61">from that Freemason Lodge in DC to the</text>
  <text start="1821.63" dur="5.64">Federal Reserve to the Capitol building</text>
  <text start="1823.96" dur="5.189">and to the White House and he saw</text>
  <text start="1827.27" dur="4.389">Hillary Clinton as a young woman</text>
  <text start="1829.149" dur="5.27">participate in cannibalism</text>
  <text start="1831.659" dur="4.681">he actually survived he did see some</text>
  <text start="1834.419" dur="3.72">satanic ritual abuse and some sacrifices</text>
  <text start="1836.34" dur="3.779">he survived because he was from a</text>
  <text start="1838.139" dur="3.87">bloodline family where they were not</text>
  <text start="1840.119" dur="3.211">going to they were gonna abuse him but</text>
  <text start="1842.009" dur="4.11">they were not gonna kill him they were</text>
  <text start="1843.33" dur="5.13">not gonna sacrifice him right and and</text>
  <text start="1846.119" dur="5.071">you know eventually he he got out of</text>
  <text start="1848.46" dur="6.36">that obviously and and and his and as a</text>
  <text start="1851.19" dur="5.88">major SR a survivor but I just you know</text>
  <text start="1854.82" dur="5.069">I found it fascinating that he had this</text>
  <text start="1857.07" dur="4.919">happening to him in the 1970s in the</text>
  <text start="1859.889" dur="3.36">tunnels beneath DC and you found</text>
  <text start="1861.989" dur="3.39">yourself even though you were in</text>
  <text start="1863.249" dur="5.461">Hollywood when they captured you for the</text>
  <text start="1865.379" dur="6.42">second time you found yourself in a cage</text>
  <text start="1868.71" dur="5.13">that wound up being in Maryland where</text>
  <text start="1871.799" dur="5.161">obviously you&amp;#39;re right across the</text>
  <text start="1873.84" dur="5.219">Potomac River from you know from the</text>
  <text start="1876.96" dur="4.86">from the Washington Monument the Capitol</text>
  <text start="1879.059" dur="4.2">building so and we know that during the</text>
  <text start="1881.82" dur="2.01">1980s which is when you would have</text>
  <text start="1883.259" dur="3.03">escaped</text>
  <text start="1883.83" dur="4.679">we know that Bush Senior was the vice</text>
  <text start="1886.289" dur="5.46">president at the time and he was a major</text>
  <text start="1888.509" dur="4.74">major satanic pedophile so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1891.749" dur="7.201">why I was curious about asking if you</text>
  <text start="1893.249" dur="13.77">recognized anybody well no not not that</text>
  <text start="1898.95" dur="13.069">I can be sure of I&amp;#39;ve seen faces on TV</text>

  <text start="1937.619" dur="6.24">the cage to look at us we were drugged</text>

  <text start="1943.859" dur="5.101">drugs they were giving us weren&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="1945.479" dur="8">to subdue us but to alter our our minds</text>
