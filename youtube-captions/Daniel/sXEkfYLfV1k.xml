  <text start="3.629" dur="7.14">hebrew month it is the morning sabbath</text>
  <text start="6.45" dur="8.069">service and this is now part 8 of the</text>
  <text start="10.769" dur="5.04">Torah and the New Testament the Torah</text>
  <text start="14.519" dur="6.031">the New Testament and we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="15.809" dur="7.8">going over the book of 1st Timothy first</text>
  <text start="20.55" dur="4.59">Timothy one and 474 two chapters and</text>
  <text start="23.609" dur="3.781">first Timothy that again are often used</text>
  <text start="25.14" dur="4.469">by Christians to try to say we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="27.39" dur="5.75">have to keep Torah when they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="29.609" dur="6.061">misunderstanding what Paul is the same</text>
  <text start="33.14" dur="4.87">so we will examine the book of 1st</text>
  <text start="35.67" dur="5.37">Timothy however as we shall soon see</text>
  <text start="38.01" dur="4.83">those who do this have turned aside unto</text>
  <text start="41.04" dur="4.26">vain jangling those who have</text>
  <text start="42.84" dur="3.809">misinterpreted first book of for Timothy</text>
  <text start="45.3" dur="3.239">have turned aside into vain jangling</text>
  <text start="46.649" dur="3.691">desiring to be teachers of the Torah</text>
  <text start="48.539" dur="4.59">understanding neither what they say nor</text>
  <text start="50.34" dur="4.289">where if they affirm and then this is a</text>
  <text start="53.129" dur="2.791">problem that we have in this is the</text>
  <text start="54.629" dur="2.791">reason I quote that versus it&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="55.92" dur="3.06">there in Timothy it&amp;#39;s that what happens</text>
  <text start="57.42" dur="4.439">is people who don&amp;#39;t even know the Torah</text>
  <text start="58.98" dur="4.68">or study the Torah um they pretty much</text>
  <text start="61.859" dur="4.201">center on the New Testament then they</text>
  <text start="63.66" dur="3.69">they try to tell other people what the</text>
  <text start="66.06" dur="2.129">tour is all about and they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="67.35" dur="2.01">understand what they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="68.189" dur="3.061">because they&amp;#39;re not doing it they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="69.36" dur="4.92">practicing it they&amp;#39;re not O&amp;#39;Banion and</text>
  <text start="71.25" dur="5.7">and so they start talking about what</text>
  <text start="74.28" dur="4.56">they don&amp;#39;t know in the first chapter</text>
  <text start="76.95" dur="3.36">first Timothy one we deal with only two</text>
  <text start="78.84" dur="3.72">verses which have been plucked out of</text>
  <text start="80.31" dur="3.989">the chapter and uses a mindless club to</text>
  <text start="82.56" dur="5.059">stifle tour obedience and those two</text>
  <text start="84.299" dur="6.18">verses are in 1st Timothy 1 9 and 10</text>
  <text start="87.619" dur="5.051">knowing this that the law the torah is</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="4.35">not made for a righteous man but for the</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="4.019">lawless and disobedient for the ungodly</text>
  <text start="94.829" dur="4.411">and for sinners for unholy and profane</text>
  <text start="96.689" dur="4.081">for murderers of fathers and murderers</text>
  <text start="99.24" dur="3.39">and mothers for man&amp;#39;s layers for</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="3.959">whoremongers for then the defile</text>
  <text start="102.63" dur="4.29">themselves with mankind for men steelers</text>
  <text start="104.729" dur="3.39">for liars for perjured persons that have</text>
  <text start="106.92" dur="4.05">there been any other thing that is</text>
  <text start="108.119" dur="4.351">contrary to sound doctrine so the anti</text>
  <text start="110.97" dur="2.969">Troy Christians will say that Paul makes</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="3.3">clear the Torres only for the</text>
  <text start="113.939" dur="4.64">disobedient the wicked to bring them to</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="5.55">full repentance this is however absurd</text>
  <text start="118.579" dur="4.841">if I am righteous and love yah I no</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="3.89">longer need the Torah I can go out and</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="5.039">murder and steal and rape and pillage</text>
  <text start="125.21" dur="4.99">yah forbid when Paul says that the</text>
  <text start="128.459" dur="3.901">torrid is not made for a righteous man</text>
  <text start="130.2" dur="3.18">before the lawless he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="132.36" dur="3.87">Torah bring</text>
  <text start="133.38" dur="4.71">sinners to repentance obviously does not</text>
  <text start="136.23" dur="3.51">bring the righteous to repentance the</text>
  <text start="138.09" dur="3.09">righteous have no need to be brought to</text>
  <text start="139.74" dur="4.32">repentance in other words this is the</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="4.56">point he&amp;#39;s been making in Romans and in</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="4.05">other passages we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="145.74" dur="4.71">that the Torah one of the purposes of</text>
  <text start="148.11" dur="5.22">the Torah is to bring men to repentance</text>
  <text start="150.45" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s to point out their sin and so in</text>
  <text start="153.33" dur="3.87">this context of 1st Timothy Paul saying</text>
  <text start="155.19" dur="4.53">look the function of the tour of the law</text>
  <text start="157.2" dur="4.47">is to show and point out to murderers</text>
  <text start="159.72" dur="3.66">and liars and whoremongers and cheaters</text>
  <text start="161.67" dur="3.21">and Steelers and these people that hey</text>
  <text start="163.38" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re living wrongly they&amp;#39;re living in</text>
  <text start="164.88" dur="4.17">sin it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s an affirmation of living</text>
  <text start="166.83" dur="4.41">in sin but that in no way means that the</text>
  <text start="169.05" dur="3.51">tour is not for the righteous it just</text>
  <text start="171.24" dur="3.33">means that the tour it doesn&amp;#39;t bring the</text>
  <text start="172.56" dur="3.63">righteous to repentance why because the</text>
  <text start="174.57" dur="3.36">righteous are already obeying the Torah</text>
  <text start="176.19" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re filled with the love of Yahshua</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="2.85">and so they&amp;#39;re obeying it so obviously</text>
  <text start="179.64" dur="5.07">the tour doesn&amp;#39;t have to bring a</text>
  <text start="180.78" dur="6.12">righteous one to repentance the Torah</text>
  <text start="184.71" dur="4.62">has numerous functions one of which is</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="3.99">to bring the ungodly to repentance after</text>
  <text start="189.33" dur="3.59">all the psalmist declares that the Torah</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="4.35">is perfect in converting the soul</text>
  <text start="192.92" dur="4.18">obviously one who is righteous and loves</text>
  <text start="195.24" dur="3.48">yah striving to keep the presets of</text>
  <text start="197.1" dur="3.32">Torah does not need the tour to bring in</text>
  <text start="198.72" dur="4.74">to repentance or to convert him in</text>
  <text start="200.42" dur="5.32">effect the Torah was not made for the</text>
  <text start="203.46" dur="4.56">righteous man in regards to bringing him</text>
  <text start="205.74" dur="3.96">to repentance this does not imply</text>
  <text start="208.02" dur="4.83">however that the Torah is altogether</text>
  <text start="209.7" dur="5.67">useless to the righteous man far from it</text>
  <text start="212.85" dur="5.19">and and we know this because if you go</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="6.63">to Matthew 5 17 through 21 what does</text>
  <text start="218.04" dur="5.43">yahoo say he says he who does even the</text>
  <text start="222" dur="3.12">least Commandments and Torah and teaches</text>
  <text start="223.47" dur="4.5">others will be known as great in my</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="4.47">kingdom so we know the Torah is is is</text>
  <text start="227.97" dur="4.8">designed for the righteous man I mean</text>
  <text start="229.59" dur="5.52">when when the people various individuals</text>
  <text start="232.77" dur="3.87">approached Jesus and said what must I do</text>
  <text start="235.11" dur="3.72">to inherit internal life and what does</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="4.05">yasha do he quotes the tour to them you</text>
  <text start="238.83" dur="3.45">know honor your parents love God love</text>
  <text start="240.69" dur="2.76">your neighbor he lists these</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="3.84">commandments that you need to do to</text>
  <text start="243.45" dur="4.38">inherit eternal life so obviously the</text>
  <text start="246.12" dur="3.48">Torah the commandments are made for the</text>
  <text start="247.83" dur="5.1">righteous but the context of 1st Timothy</text>
  <text start="249.6" dur="5.79">one is Paul is dealing with one of the</text>
  <text start="252.93" dur="4.47">functions of the Torah which is to bring</text>
  <text start="255.39" dur="3.36">wicked to repentance and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="3.42">this tour is not designed to bring</text>
  <text start="258.75" dur="4.169">righteous to repentance it&amp;#39;s designed to</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="3.78">bring the wicked repentance why because</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="3.541">the righteous should already be</text>
  <text start="264.6" dur="2.37">naturally wanting to obey the Torah and</text>
  <text start="266.46" dur="4.02">that</text>
  <text start="266.97" dur="5.46">the point is making okay so that deals</text>
  <text start="270.48" dur="4.5">with the misunderstood part in first</text>
  <text start="272.43" dur="6.03">Timothy chapter 1 now let&amp;#39;s move on to</text>
  <text start="274.98" dur="6.03">first Timothy chapter 4 we will deal</text>
  <text start="278.46" dur="4.53">with only the first five verses as these</text>
  <text start="281.01" dur="5.16">that are most used to say we can eat</text>
  <text start="282.99" dur="4.47">whatever we want quoting starting in</text>
  <text start="286.17" dur="4.05">verse 1 now the spirit speaketh</text>
  <text start="287.46" dur="5.16">expressly that in the latter times it</text>
  <text start="290.22" dur="4.53">would be now the last days the end days</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="3.69">before yashas return some shall depart</text>
