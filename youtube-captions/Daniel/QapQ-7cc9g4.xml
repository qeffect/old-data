  <text start="35.82" dur="4.38">the end of that hour we are we&amp;#39;re pumped</text>
  <text start="37.8" dur="4.62">we were pumped the spirits there are</text>
  <text start="40.2" dur="4.41">loosened so we do that for the first</text>
  <text start="42.42" dur="3.06">hour and then for the next half hour or</text>
  <text start="44.61" dur="5.1">so</text>
  <text start="45.48" dur="8.79">John leads and he prays for 15 we have a</text>
  <text start="49.71" dur="6.66">list now with 1800 so he goes through 15</text>
  <text start="54.27" dur="3.99">a night and he prays and calls mountain</text>
  <text start="56.37" dur="3.239">and we all degree agree with him and</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="3.599">join with him the crane of spirit that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="59.609" dur="5.431">he&amp;#39;s lifting these up and once he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="61.859" dur="5.641">I then pray for the ministry a</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="3.99">protection for my YouTube platform for</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="1.95">my marriage and all this stuff for his</text>
  <text start="69.03" dur="3.3">stuff</text>
  <text start="69.45" dur="4.529">everyone agrees with me and then gene</text>
  <text start="72.33" dur="3.539">and candy or a husband and wife couple</text>
  <text start="73.979" dur="4.591">in Portland they&amp;#39;ve been going to our</text>
  <text start="75.869" dur="4.29">group for about a year now they prayed</text>
  <text start="78.57" dur="4.56">for President Trump and for Bill Maher</text>
  <text start="80.159" dur="4.681">and they do this every night so that</text>
  <text start="83.13" dur="3.45">takes us into about an hour and a half</text>
  <text start="84.84" dur="3.51">an hour and 45 minutes of our meeting</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="2.91">and then the remainder of the time you</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="2.55">meet for about two hours every night</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="2.91">there remember the time I then open it</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="3.57">up and ask if anyone has a prayer</text>
  <text start="92.4" dur="4.35">request praise your port and he may just</text>
  <text start="94.47" dur="4.32">want to share and then people start</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="3.39">sharing and sometimes we even meet past</text>
  <text start="98.79" dur="3.539">it two hours but we try to keep it to</text>
  <text start="100.14" dur="5.25">two hours a night and that&amp;#39;s what we do</text>
  <text start="102.329" dur="5.551">that&amp;#39;s all we do on sometimes if our</text>
  <text start="105.39" dur="3.78">prayer meeting ends early some people</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="2.699">will have questions about the Bible so</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="2.76">we&amp;#39;ll go into a Bible study but</text>
  <text start="110.579" dur="4.65">typically it&amp;#39;s just praise and worship</text>
  <text start="111.93" dur="4.56">and prayers that&amp;#39;s what we stick to and</text>
  <text start="115.229" dur="4.771">that&amp;#39;s what we do two hours a night and</text>
  <text start="116.49" dur="5.22">I&amp;#39;ll tell you one thing you&amp;#39;d think that</text>
  <text start="120" dur="4.799">spending two hours every night would</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="5.699">really SAP away the time the exact</text>
  <text start="124.799" dur="4.161">opposite happens you give two hours of</text>
  <text start="127.409" dur="4.211">your night every night to</text>
  <text start="128.96" dur="5.22">and you find that he gives you more time</text>
  <text start="131.62" dur="4.24">he prioritizes your life like you</text>
  <text start="134.18" dur="3.33">wouldn&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="4.56">when I first started this investigative</text>
  <text start="137.51" dur="3.96">journalism it was in July of 2018 for</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="3.06">the first few months I didn&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="141.47" dur="3.39">nightly burning and it was chaos I was</text>
  <text start="143.48" dur="2.67">getting attacked everywhere I couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="144.86" dur="2.72">keep things straight it was just I was</text>
  <text start="146.15" dur="4.13">like online Millican you to do this</text>
  <text start="147.58" dur="4.87">started doing the prayer meetings</text>
  <text start="150.28" dur="4.18">literally what would happen is I go into</text>
  <text start="152.45" dur="3.69">the library usually would take me</text>
  <text start="154.46" dur="4.32">several hours to research everything to</text>
  <text start="156.14" dur="4.26">put together just one video I go into</text>
  <text start="158.78" dur="3.84">the library after a two-hour priming I</text>
  <text start="160.4" dur="3.99">go to the library the next day and bam</text>
  <text start="162.62" dur="3.3">an email would show up this guy would</text>
  <text start="164.39" dur="2.73">contact me this guy would call me and</text>
  <text start="165.92" dur="2.7">all of a sudden I had my YouTube with</text>
  <text start="167.12" dur="4.32">all this documentation evidence and it</text>
  <text start="168.62" dur="4.26">took me like 25 minutes because the Holy</text>
  <text start="171.44" dur="4.41">Spirit was in control not me</text>
  <text start="172.88" dur="4.08">he was my investigative journalism so</text>
  <text start="175.85" dur="2.7">then I started putting out two videos</text>
  <text start="176.96" dur="2.94">sometimes three videos a day they were</text>
  <text start="178.55" dur="2.58">like how I was standing there putting on</text>
  <text start="179.9" dur="2.91">all this content with all these</text>
  <text start="181.13" dur="4.82">citations on what how is this happening</text>
  <text start="182.81" dur="6.15">cuz it&amp;#39;s him you put him first and</text>
  <text start="185.95" dur="5.08">that&amp;#39;ll apply to any of you guys he will</text>
  <text start="188.96" dur="3.72">just make your life so focused and he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="191.03" dur="3.69">guide you supernatural in ways because</text>
  <text start="192.68" dur="3.96">he appreciates it when you give him that</text>
  <text start="194.72" dur="3.63">amount of time to him he really</text>
  <text start="196.64" dur="3.45">appreciates it so he&amp;#39;s gonna he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="198.35" dur="3.84">bless you back way more than what the</text>
  <text start="200.09" dur="4.62">way you blessed him and they&amp;#39;ll make you</text>
  <text start="202.19" dur="4.68">much more productive and and just and</text>
  <text start="204.71" dur="3.06">all this stuff so and then also the</text>
  <text start="206.87" dur="3.33">other thing that the prayer meeting</text>
  <text start="207.77" dur="5.22">really helped me out with was because of</text>
  <text start="210.2" dur="4.65">all the attacks I get from my past and</text>
  <text start="212.99" dur="4.02">trolls and people lying about me</text>
  <text start="214.85" dur="3.6">it was really affecting me to the point</text>
  <text start="217.01" dur="3.48">where I was about to say I can&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="218.45" dur="4.23">anymore well once the prayer meeting</text>
  <text start="220.49" dur="3.69">started those attacks didn&amp;#39;t stop they</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="5.1">got more intense but now there was this</text>
  <text start="224.18" dur="5.4">wall I just didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="227.78" dur="3.45">anymore I just didn&amp;#39;t care about it I</text>
  <text start="229.58" dur="3.33">even had well-meaning subscribers saying</text>
  <text start="231.23" dur="3.27">Daniel this person&amp;#39;s talking about you</text>
  <text start="232.91" dur="4.5">in this way and this and I still have</text>
  <text start="234.5" dur="4.89">that I just delete those emails I just I</text>
  <text start="237.41" dur="4.89">won&amp;#39;t focus on it and that walls around</text>
  <text start="239.39" dur="4.77">me and some of those trolls that were</text>
  <text start="242.3" dur="4.16">really dogging me a year ago they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.16" dur="5.49">gone YouTube channels have been erased</text>
  <text start="246.46" dur="4.84">so there&amp;#39;s a scripture in Psalm 37 in</text>
  <text start="249.65" dur="3.81">front of my favorite song he says behold</text>
  <text start="251.3" dur="3.04">you will search for the wicked and the</text>
  <text start="253.46" dur="4.73">wicked</text>

  <text start="959.879" dur="6.661">happens when you wear clothing of 100</text>
  <text start="961.47" dur="7.919">percent materials yeah so there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="966.54" dur="5.159">really esoteric laws in the Torah they</text>
  <text start="969.389" dur="4.41">talk about wearing clothing it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="971.699" dur="3.39">mixed so like I&amp;#39;m wearing a hundred</text>
  <text start="973.799" dur="5.28">percent cotton shirt is a hundred</text>

  <text start="979.079" dur="3.66">was an atheist of all people in 1996 he</text>
  <text start="981.689" dur="3.481">came out with a book called the body</text>
  <text start="982.739" dur="3.871">electric and he&amp;#39;s just curious he was</text>
  <text start="985.17" dur="3.18">like I wonder why the Bible says to do</text>
  <text start="986.61" dur="3.63">that and he found out that there are</text>
  <text start="988.35" dur="3.51">these electromagnetic waves that flow</text>
  <text start="990.24" dur="4.529">through our body and when we wear</text>
  <text start="991.86" dur="4.979">clothing of unmixed material that it</text>
  <text start="994.769" dur="3.75">facilitates those waves that travel more</text>

  <text start="1006.139" dur="3.39">started obeying these Commandments when</text>
  <text start="1007.549" dur="5.04">I was about 21 22 years of age and</text>
  <text start="1009.529" dur="4.86">started growing really and maybe every</text>
  <text start="1012.589" dur="3.84">five years I&amp;#39;ll get a cold or a flu or</text>
  <text start="1014.389" dur="4.41">something but other than that I never</text>
  <text start="1016.429" dur="3.87">get sick and I think it&amp;#39;s due to the</text>
  <text start="1018.799" dur="3.09">fact that I&amp;#39;m keeping these Commandments</text>
  <text start="1020.299" dur="3.54">their blessing they will bless you it&amp;#39;ll</text>

  <text start="1032.389" dur="4.65">it says say unto the children of Israel</text>
  <text start="1034.669" dur="4.14">the same language is used for the</text>
  <text start="1037.039" dur="3.75">Sabbath and we know the Sabbath not just</text>

  <text start="1040.789" dur="4.4">specifically for men and women it</text>
  <text start="1042.079" dur="6.12">actually specifies that in the Torah</text>
  <text start="1045.189" dur="5.081">yeah now the head covering is a is a</text>
  <text start="1048.199" dur="4.621">more complicated issue because if you</text>
  <text start="1050.27" dur="2.77">read 1st Corinthians 11 it almost sounds</text>
  <text start="1052.82" dur="2.2">like</text>
  <text start="1053.04" dur="3.6">even King James for instance it sounds</text>
  <text start="1055.02" dur="4.58">like Paul&amp;#39;s telling women to cover their</text>

  <text start="1059.6" dur="4.81">that doesn&amp;#39;t really make sense because</text>
  <text start="1061.65" dur="4.86">Paul was a master of Torah if we go to</text>
  <text start="1064.41" dur="4.35">the Tanakh we see that the priests all</text>

  <text start="1072.69" dur="5.28">priests and kings so what is Paul saying</text>
  <text start="1075.3" dur="5.46">well if you go back to the literal Greek</text>
  <text start="1077.97" dur="5.4">of what Paul is saying in first Kings</text>
  <text start="1080.76" dur="4.92">legends he&amp;#39;s telling women to wear long</text>
  <text start="1083.37" dur="5.67">flowing veils when they prayer prophesy</text>
  <text start="1085.68" dur="4.8">and for men not to wear long flowing</text>
  <text start="1089.04" dur="3.24">veils because there was cross-dressing</text>
  <text start="1090.48" dur="2.85">going on in court there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1092.28" dur="3.12">strange fire going on course but</text>
  <text start="1093.33" dur="4.38">cross-dressing was one of him so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1095.4" dur="3.9">trying to teach them but he absolutely</text>

  <text start="1399.38" dur="5.82">Great Tribulation so let&amp;#39;s address the</text>
  <text start="1401.779" dur="5.25">first thing you said seven years in</text>
  <text start="1405.2" dur="4.079">Daniel 9 is the only time we read about</text>
  <text start="1407.029" dur="4.741">these seven years and it says in the</text>
  <text start="1409.279" dur="5.161">midst of that week he&amp;#39;s cut off well</text>
  <text start="1411.77" dur="4.17">when was Messiah cut off guys two</text>
  <text start="1414.44" dur="4.77">thousand years ago he was crucified he</text>
  <text start="1415.94" dur="6.03">was cut off you go to Revelation after</text>
  <text start="1419.21" dur="6.7">the Gospels you see a reference to three</text>
  <text start="1421.97" dur="6.25">and a half years 42 months 1260 days</text>
  <text start="1425.91" dur="3.389">but there&amp;#39;s no seven years so what</text>
  <text start="1428.22" dur="3.36">happened what was the difference between</text>
  <text start="1429.299" dur="3.901">when Diego talks about these seven years</text>
  <text start="1431.58" dur="3.57">the Messiah&amp;#39;s cut off in the midst and</text>
  <text start="1433.2" dur="3.75">then we get to Revelation at the Gospels</text>
  <text start="1435.15" dur="4.29">well Jesus fulfilled the first three and</text>
  <text start="1436.95" dur="4.229">a half years in his earthly ministry and</text>
  <text start="1439.44" dur="5.04">then he was cut off just like Deanna</text>
  <text start="1441.179" dur="5.911">prophesied but then the clock stopped it</text>
  <text start="1444.48" dur="4.35">stops because for the last two thousand</text>
  <text start="1447.09" dur="3.87">years it&amp;#39;s been the time of the Gentiles</text>
  <text start="1448.83" dur="4.62">to get grafted in to the Commonwealth of</text>
  <text start="1450.96" dur="5.16">Israel that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happened so that</text>
  <text start="1453.45" dur="4.08">last three and a half years is all about</text>
  <text start="1456.12" dur="3.689">all that were waiting for so there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1457.53" dur="4.68">seven-year tribulation there&amp;#39;s a three</text>
  <text start="1459.809" dur="3.811">and a half year 42 months 1260 day</text>
  <text start="1462.21" dur="6.93">tribulation and it&amp;#39;s talked about over</text>
  <text start="1463.62" dur="7.799">over again revelation not necessarily</text>
  <text start="1469.14" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;re not taken but this is where the</text>
  <text start="1471.419" dur="4.951">teaching of the Church of Philadelphia</text>
  <text start="1472.74" dur="4.14">comes in so I love this subject all</text>

  <text start="1945.19" dur="2.46">that&amp;#39;s how you escape the Great</text>
  <text start="1946.69" dur="3.7">Tribulation</text>
  <text start="1947.65" dur="4.81">that&amp;#39;s how you do it now here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1950.39" dur="3.81">something really cool so at the very</text>
  <text start="1952.46" dur="2.97">beginning of the Great Tribulation he is</text>
  <text start="1954.2" dur="3.3">going to gather his Philadelphia</text>
  <text start="1955.43" dur="3.54">supernaturally and he&amp;#39;s going to take</text>
  <text start="1957.5" dur="4.23">into that safe place as it says in</text>
  <text start="1958.97" dur="5.67">Revelation 12 so there&amp;#39;s this horizontal</text>
  <text start="1961.73" dur="4.44">gathering right then at the end of the</text>
  <text start="1964.64" dur="3.42">Great Tribulation we come to the seventh</text>
  <text start="1966.17" dur="3">trumpet and that&amp;#39;s when what the</text>
  <text start="1968.06" dur="3.21">Christians called the rapture happens</text>
  <text start="1969.17" dur="4.11">for the deadness I rise first those two</text>
  <text start="1971.27" dur="4.41">witnesses that are slaughtered they rise</text>
  <text start="1973.28" dur="4.08">up all the deadness I rise up causes</text>
  <text start="1975.68" dur="4.08">these massive earthquakes you think of</text>
  <text start="1977.36" dur="3.96">all these graves opening up and then we</text>
  <text start="1979.76" dur="3.41">who are alive those who are in the safe</text>
  <text start="1981.32" dur="3.96">place we get caught up to be with them</text>
  <text start="1983.17" dur="5.68">so then we have that vertical</text>
  <text start="1985.28" dur="6.09">resurrection right yeah horizontal</text>
  <text start="1988.85" dur="6.18">vertical yeah that&amp;#39;s the sign at the top</text>
  <text start="1991.37" dur="5.64">and Hebrew that salvation well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1995.03" dur="4.23">what we see so there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1997.01" dur="3.78">pre-tribulation rapture I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="1999.26" dur="6.96">people want to teach that that&amp;#39;s not in</text>
  <text start="2000.79" dur="8.19">the scriptures Paul in 1st Corinthians</text>
  <text start="2006.22" dur="5.91">15 he says behold I show you a mystery</text>
  <text start="2008.98" dur="5.43">at the last Trump at the twinkling of an</text>
  <text start="2012.13" dur="3.72">eye he talks about our resurrection our</text>
  <text start="2014.41" dur="3.42">transformation where were you caught up</text>
  <text start="2015.85" dur="4.59">to view of Jesus but he specifically</text>
  <text start="2017.83" dur="3.81">says it&amp;#39;s the last Trump he says behold</text>
  <text start="2020.44" dur="2.97">I show you a mystery</text>
  <text start="2021.64" dur="3.63">if you go to Apostle John&amp;#39;s told the</text>
  <text start="2023.41" dur="4.14">same Holy Spirit as boss&amp;#39;ll Paul he</text>
  <text start="2025.27" dur="4.77">writes in Revelation 10 let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="2027.55" dur="4.8">this mystery the mystery that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="2030.04" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s been covered and then what does</text>
  <text start="2032.35" dur="3.72">he talk about he then describes the</text>
  <text start="2034.63" dur="3.54">seventh the days of the seventh trumpet</text>
  <text start="2036.07" dur="3.87">he talks about the two witnesses getting</text>
  <text start="2038.17" dur="3.18">murdered and then they have the</text>
  <text start="2039.94" dur="3.6">resurrection they stand upon their feet</text>
  <text start="2041.35" dur="3.81">and they rise up and there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="2043.54" dur="4.23">massive earthquake that strikes out a</text>
  <text start="2045.16" dur="5.04">tenth of Jerusalem and seven thousand</text>
  <text start="2047.77" dur="3.81">died and the rest give glory to God that</text>
  <text start="2050.2" dur="4.92">would kind of expand their revival in</text>
  <text start="2051.58" dur="4.89">Jerusalem and so this happens for the</text>
  <text start="2055.12" dur="7.44">end of the Great Tribulation that</text>
  <text start="2056.47" dur="8.01">seventh trumpet resurrection so you know</text>
  <text start="2062.56" dur="3.48">again my personal opinion is that this</text>
  <text start="2064.48" dur="2.78">will start and this will kick off in</text>
  <text start="2066.04" dur="3.139">late winter early</text>
  <text start="2067.26" dur="4.47">20:24 but again I could be wrong on that</text>
  <text start="2069.179" dur="6.48">but it will happen and there is a way to</text>
  <text start="2071.73" dur="5.24">escape so I have a lot of teachers have</text>
  <text start="2075.659" dur="3.181">learned a lot more detail on this</text>
  <text start="2076.97" dur="11.439">scriptures everything and it&amp;#39;s on my</text>
  <text start="2078.84" dur="11.4">website but that&amp;#39;s sort of a nut shy and</text>
  <text start="2088.409" dur="3.451">it makes sense also with the context of</text>
  <text start="2090.24" dur="3.419">what we&amp;#39;re living in think about this I</text>
  <text start="2091.86" dur="3.6">believe that we&amp;#39;re gonna get to a point</text>
  <text start="2093.659" dur="3.931">where we are gonna start seeing these</text>
  <text start="2095.46" dur="4.71">satanic pedophiles executed and publicly</text>
  <text start="2097.59" dur="4.05">and I even believe I think Hughes talked</text>
  <text start="2100.17" dur="3.54">about this too that these guillotines</text>
  <text start="2101.64" dur="3.57">that Obama ordered and yeah Bush in</text>
  <text start="2103.71" dur="3.27">order to close that Trump&amp;#39;s gonna use</text>
  <text start="2105.21" dur="4.32">them against the Satanic medabots</text>
  <text start="2106.98" dur="4.05">well now think about this so now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2109.53" dur="3.57">having a judicial system in which these</text>
  <text start="2111.03" dur="5.34">satanic pedophiles are being beheaded or</text>
  <text start="2113.1" dur="5.07">publicly executed so then when the son</text>
  <text start="2116.37" dur="3.99">of perdition comes on the scene it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2118.17" dur="5.37">going to be like this sudden change it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2120.36" dur="4.65">all gonna be set in place right only the</text>
  <text start="2123.54" dur="2.61">only problem is at that point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2125.01" dur="3.66">gonna start being used against that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2126.15" dur="4.23">against the believers but again this is</text>
  <text start="2128.67" dur="5.25">why y&amp;#39;all giving us this reprieve to get</text>
  <text start="2130.38" dur="5.46">our house in order to get ready okay to</text>
  <text start="2133.92" dur="3.6">prepare ourselves now the only caveat</text>
  <text start="2135.84" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;ll save in this Philadelphia thing I</text>
  <text start="2137.52" dur="3.72">do believe y&amp;#39;all wants every Christian</text>
  <text start="2139.41" dur="4.41">to be part of Philadelphia but again</text>
  <text start="2141.24" dur="3.48">five of them decided to stay in sin so</text>
  <text start="2143.82" dur="3.51">they have to go to the great</text>
  <text start="2144.72" dur="4.11">tribulations become purified Smyrna is</text>
  <text start="2147.33" dur="4.08">an exception Smyrna was not ready for</text>
  <text start="2148.83" dur="4.74">sin but there talked about in Daniel 11</text>
  <text start="2151.41" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re specifically appointed to lead</text>
  <text start="2153.57" dur="4.23">the other five congregations and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2155.64" dur="3.51">appointed a margin and I&amp;#39;ve talked to a</text>
  <text start="2157.8" dur="2.82">few Christians that said yeah Holy</text>

  <text start="2228.85" dur="6.18">again in 2024</text>
  <text start="2231.31" dur="5.82">there&amp;#39;s 2300 days which is about 6.8</text>
  <text start="2235.03" dur="5.91">years there&amp;#39;s a 2300 days talked about</text>

  <text start="2257.59" dur="4.26">Pentecost that here but if my timeline</text>
  <text start="2260.23" dur="4.29">is correct not only is Trump gonna win</text>
  <text start="2261.85" dur="5.58">in a massive landslide but by 2021</text>
  <text start="2264.52" dur="4.29">by June of 2021 the Jews will finally</text>

  <text start="2270.94" dur="5.91">2021 and you&amp;#39;ll start seeing that go</text>
  <text start="2273.37" dur="5.4">forward but again you know I could be</text>
  <text start="2276.85" dur="3.38">wrong on the timing but I think what</text>
  <text start="2278.77" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;re gonna see in Trump&amp;#39;s second term</text>
  <text start="2280.23" dur="3.46">is we&amp;#39;re gonna see an explosion of</text>
  <text start="2282.61" dur="2.1">prosperity because we&amp;#39;re gonna have the</text>
  <text start="2283.69" dur="2.58">gold back currency</text>
  <text start="2284.71" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;re gonna have the abolition of the</text>
  <text start="2286.27" dur="4.59">Federal Reserve but if you look at</text>
  <text start="2289.24" dur="3.99">history what happened to Israel when</text>
  <text start="2290.86" dur="5.19">they got prosperous they forget about</text>
  <text start="2293.23" dur="4.68">God right so unfortunately because we</text>
  <text start="2296.05" dur="3.39">haven&amp;#39;t seen that really deep-seated</text>
  <text start="2297.91" dur="3.21">revival that we saw in the first and</text>
  <text start="2299.44" dur="4.02">second grade wakings we&amp;#39;re gonna get a</text>
  <text start="2301.12" dur="3.51">lot of prosperity but because people</text>
  <text start="2303.46" dur="3.21">haven&amp;#39;t really made a strong commitment</text>
  <text start="2304.63" dur="4.11">to Jesus it&amp;#39;s gonna just possibly get</text>
  <text start="2306.67" dur="4.52">drunk on prosperity and the scripture</text>
  <text start="2308.74" dur="4.98">says when there&amp;#39;s peace and prosperity</text>
  <text start="2311.19" dur="4.3">sudden destruction so I think this</text>
  <text start="2313.72" dur="2.97">second term of Trump even though he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2315.49" dur="2.82">righteous he&amp;#39;s gonna be doing a lot of</text>
  <text start="2316.69" dur="4.59">righteous things it&amp;#39;s gonna cause an</text>
  <text start="2318.31" dur="6.21">explosion of prosperity and technology</text>
  <text start="2321.28" dur="5.16">by the way the area 51 and the black hat</text>
  <text start="2324.52" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;ve kept technology away from this</text>
  <text start="2326.44" dur="4.649">but there&amp;#39;s going to be an explosion of</text>
  <text start="2328.51" dur="6.989">technology that&amp;#39;s going to hell</text>

  <text start="2343.839" dur="2.97">gonna get so prosperous and so amazing</text>
  <text start="2345.67" dur="3.059">that people are gonna really think well</text>
  <text start="2346.809" dur="4.321">maybe we didn&amp;#39;t avoid Armageddon maybe</text>
  <text start="2348.729" dur="4.441">we&amp;#39;ve entered the Millennial Kingdom and</text>
  <text start="2351.13" dur="3.479">somehow you know which is where the</text>
  <text start="2353.17" dur="4.079">deception of Dominion theology is gonna</text>
  <text start="2354.609" dur="7.051">come into but but it&amp;#39;s yeah it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2357.249" dur="6.54">be a really incredible time but but I do</text>
  <text start="2361.66" dur="4.77">believe it&amp;#39;s gonna come to an end and</text>
  <text start="2363.789" dur="5.49">you can prove this through history study</text>
  <text start="2366.43" dur="4.26">study Great Awakenings even the first</text>
  <text start="2369.279" dur="3.45">major Great Awakening the book of Acts</text>
  <text start="2370.69" dur="4.74">what you have you had signs and wonders</text>
  <text start="2372.729" dur="5.191">and miracles and then Stephen got</text>
  <text start="2375.43" dur="5.159">martyred and when Stephen got martyred</text>
  <text start="2377.92" dur="5.01">the disciples got scattered so if you</text>
  <text start="2380.589" dur="4.321">look at history you have this great time</text>
  <text start="2382.93" dur="4.439">of revival and signs and wonders and</text>
  <text start="2384.91" dur="4.02">prosperity and then God shakes to see</text>
  <text start="2387.369" dur="2.821">who&amp;#39;s really gonna stay true the</text>
  <text start="2388.93" dur="3.329">persecution comes to stay who&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2390.19" dur="3.149">true and you see that constantly</text>
  <text start="2392.259" dur="2.881">throughout Great Awakening stright</text>
  <text start="2393.339" dur="2.94">history well this is going to be the</text>
  <text start="2395.14" dur="2.879">greatest straight away game that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2396.279" dur="3.48">experiencing now what&amp;#39;s even going to</text>
  <text start="2398.019" dur="2.85">dwarf the book of Acts and then we have</text>
  <text start="2399.759" dur="3.99">the greatest shaking which is that</text>
  <text start="2400.869" dur="4.771">create tribulation really weak people</text>
  <text start="2403.749" dur="3.27">out this analogies used all through</text>
  <text start="2405.64" dur="4.139">scripture because it talks about a</text>
  <text start="2407.019" dur="5.46">farmer a farmer has a hardest and then</text>
  <text start="2409.779" dur="6.69">he Thresh&amp;#39;s that harvest so that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2412.479" dur="5.671">pattern that we see so yeah I believe</text>
  <text start="2416.469" dur="5.191">that the second term is just going to be</text>
  <text start="2418.15" dur="5.369">an incredible you know this first term</text>
  <text start="2421.66" dur="3.659">he&amp;#39;s had to fight he&amp;#39;s been on the</text>
  <text start="2423.519" dur="3.51">defense a lot and only recently as he</text>
  <text start="2425.319" dur="3.93">started going on the offense and he&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="2427.029" dur="5.19">he&amp;#39;s just gonna go so much on the</text>
  <text start="2429.249" dur="5.131">offense and I believe that also Israel</text>
  <text start="2432.219" dur="3.961">is going to become completely solvent</text>
  <text start="2434.38" dur="3.479">and they&amp;#39;re going to get their temple</text>
  <text start="2436.18" dur="5.22">and they&amp;#39;re gonna start doing their</text>
  <text start="2437.859" dur="6.99">things but that temple is going to be</text>
  <text start="2441.4" dur="5.76">polluted by by the son of perdition so</text>
  <text start="2444.849" dur="4.37">not something that Plus that temple is</text>
  <text start="2447.16" dur="4.409">going to be controlled by Jews or</text>
  <text start="2449.219" dur="3.54">totally controlled by download and</text>
  <text start="2451.569" dur="4.53">Kabbalah</text>
  <text start="2452.759" dur="4.421">so that&amp;#39;s one deception that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2456.099" dur="1.93">concerned about in the Hebrew roots</text>
  <text start="2457.18" dur="2.439">movement is that</text>
  <text start="2458.029" dur="3.45">has been a move to say that once</text>
  <text start="2459.619" dur="3.42">tribulation hits and America is knocked</text>
  <text start="2461.479" dur="3.66">out that where to go to Israel and be a</text>
  <text start="2463.039" dur="4.14">part of the temples and that&amp;#39;s total</text>
  <text start="2465.139" dur="3.72">deception you know we found what we</text>
  <text start="2467.179" dur="3.09">should be involved in is the zekiel</text>
  <text start="2468.859" dur="3.45">temple which will be in the window</text>
  <text start="2470.269" dur="4.05">kingdom but that&amp;#39;s after we are</text>
  <text start="2472.309" dur="3.99">transformed to meet Jesus in the air and</text>
  <text start="2474.319" dur="3.33">our resurrected bodies so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2476.299" dur="8.97">have nothing to do with that temple and</text>
  <text start="2477.649" dur="9.06">so we let Jesus take care well so</text>
  <text start="2485.269" dur="3.24">Netanyahu who he&amp;#39;s coming under</text>
  <text start="2486.709" dur="4.05">indictment that guy is very correct and</text>
  <text start="2488.509" dur="4.77">Trump knows it I know Trump pretends</text>
  <text start="2490.759" dur="5.19">like he likes them but Netanyahu he was</text>
  <text start="2493.279" dur="5.22">as far as my information that I got he</text>
  <text start="2495.949" dur="5.16">was aware and involved with the Mossad</text>
  <text start="2498.499" dur="7.53">the CIA and the bushes in orchestrating</text>
  <text start="2501.109" dur="6.92">9/11 so so I have a feeling he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2506.029" dur="9.71">get exposed totally for his corruption</text>
  <text start="2508.029" dur="7.71">yeah all right</text>
  <text start="2523.399" dur="4.26">so that&amp;#39;s you know you gotta be</text>
  <text start="2526.249" dur="3.63">prayerful but that that&amp;#39;s up to you I</text>
  <text start="2527.659" dur="5.52">know x22 report recommends buying gold</text>
  <text start="2529.879" dur="5.16">and others do that&amp;#39;s just that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2533.179" dur="3.75">be just a prayerful then you do I mean</text>
  <text start="2535.039" dur="6.18">people ask me for financial advice and</text>
  <text start="2536.929" dur="6.51">my financial advice really is I whenever</text>
  <text start="2541.219" dur="3.96">I get a donation ten percent of it goes</text>
  <text start="2543.439" dur="4.59">to widows and orphans that&amp;#39;s the first</text>

  <text start="2548.029" dur="6.81">that&amp;#39;s my plan so so so yeah yeah takes</text>
  <text start="2552.049" dur="4.29">care of me I think Trump is going to do</text>
  <text start="2554.839" dur="4.35">all they can to make the transition as</text>
  <text start="2556.339" dur="4.71">easy and as seamless as possible to the</text>
  <text start="2559.189" dur="4.02">gold-backed currency so I personally</text>

  <text start="2563.209" dur="2.73">gold and silver because I just I think I</text>
  <text start="2564.919" dur="4.02">think it&amp;#39;s going to be a seamless</text>
  <text start="2565.939" dur="5.04">transition to go up because there&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="2700.479" dur="15.57">me that&amp;#39;s not scriptural</text>
  <text start="2702.459" dur="17.91">oh the frequency yeah um yeah I think</text>
  <text start="2716.049" dur="7.831">there&amp;#39;s some truth to that although I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2720.369" dur="5.73">kind of I&amp;#39;ve kind of questioned that</text>
  <text start="2723.88" dur="3.719">because I have this phrasing or she</text>

  <text start="2737.319" dur="4.29">here&amp;#39;s the bottom line though even more</text>
  <text start="2739.089" dur="3.75">important than a frequency we really</text>
