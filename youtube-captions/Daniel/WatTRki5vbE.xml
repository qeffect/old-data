  <text start="30.9" dur="2.999">talk to him and hopefully also Kirk</text>
  <text start="33.12" dur="3.869">Pendergrass</text>
  <text start="33.899" dur="4.111">so basically Timothy chose not to show</text>
  <text start="36.989" dur="3.66">up today</text>
  <text start="38.01" dur="4.799">and the the judge the he legal judge</text>

  <text start="62.85" dur="3.93">get ahold of them so I&amp;#39;m hoping to get</text>
  <text start="64.92" dur="3.36">both filled McConnell and Kirk</text>
  <text start="66.78" dur="3.33">Pendergrass just to get some statements</text>

  <text start="184.41" dur="6.57">temporary delay so what they&amp;#39;ve done is</text>
  <text start="187.41" dur="7.02">they in the in their preparation to</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="5.85">commit capital felony treason they lost</text>
  <text start="194.43" dur="5.54">their nerve and so they scheduled a</text>
  <text start="196.83" dur="5.75">thinking that we all go away</text>
  <text start="199.97" dur="4.38">they rescheduled it and their quality</text>
  <text start="202.58" dur="5.01">actually issued a warrant and then</text>
  <text start="204.35" dur="6.59">they&amp;#39;ll reschedule but I think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="207.59" dur="5.4">victory for our side in America because</text>
  <text start="210.94" dur="4.36">Timothy and I have a special</text>

  <text start="238.1" dur="16.86">Amelia my eyes I don&amp;#39;t think about the</text>
  <text start="240.05" dur="17.4">law that then it&amp;#39;s corrupt and this is</text>
  <text start="254.96" dur="6.08">his way and the US government</text>
  <text start="257.45" dur="5.52">participated in the murder of their son</text>

  <text start="1671.56" dur="3.12">we should be doing when you&amp;#39;re an</text>
  <text start="1673.24" dur="3.21">American employee and you&amp;#39;re killing</text>
  <text start="1674.68" dur="4.8">another American employee because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1676.45" dur="5.1">doing the right thing but they came over</text>
  <text start="1679.48" dur="3.72">and they killed him and killing him was</text>
  <text start="1681.55" dur="4.05">a mistake number one how they killed him</text>
  <text start="1683.2" dur="4.35">was very brutal they had a cricket what</text>
  <text start="1685.6" dur="2.52">what&amp;#39;s the cricket bat it&amp;#39;s called a</text>

  <text start="1695.7" dur="6.15">ballerina anyway they they bludgeoned</text>
  <text start="1698.73" dur="5.939">him to death and then when they thought</text>
  <text start="1701.85" dur="6.39">he was dead which he wasn&amp;#39;t then they</text>
  <text start="1704.669" dur="5.64">they wanted to stage you know a suicide</text>
  <text start="1708.24" dur="3.03">so they put a shotgun in his mouth and</text>
  <text start="1710.309" dur="3.301">pulled the trigger</text>
  <text start="1711.27" dur="6.72">but he wasn&amp;#39;t dead and they know that</text>
  <text start="1713.61" dur="8.789">because after there was fresh blood in</text>
  <text start="1717.99" dur="7.34">his lungs meaning that when the pellets</text>
  <text start="1722.399" dur="8.01">or whatever they were went through his</text>
  <text start="1725.33" dur="7.51">cranial cavity this way he was still</text>
  <text start="1730.409" dur="5.421">alive at that point they thought he was</text>
  <text start="1732.84" dur="6.51">dead but they screwed that up too and</text>
  <text start="1735.83" dur="5.469">another mistake was his own brother was</text>
