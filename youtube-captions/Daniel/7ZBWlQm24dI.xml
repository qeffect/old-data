  <text start="0.38" dur="6.459">shabbat shalom mrs. Daniel John Lee with</text>
  <text start="3.36" dur="8.01">for restoration ministry this is part</text>
  <text start="6.839" dur="8.76">five of my 17 part series that is Romans</text>
  <text start="11.37" dur="6.57">chapter 14 personal scruples romans 14</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="4.801">personal scruples again showing that</text>
  <text start="17.94" dur="4.2">Apostle Paul never wrote against the</text>
  <text start="20.4" dur="5.31">Torah never said we should not keep the</text>
  <text start="22.14" dur="6.36">Torah but Paul&amp;#39;s been misunderstood and</text>
  <text start="25.71" dur="4.26">by the Christian world and because of</text>
  <text start="28.5" dur="2.939">these misunderstandings people think</text>
  <text start="29.97" dur="1.95">outlook all saying we should not keep</text>
  <text start="31.439" dur="2.161">for it</text>
  <text start="31.92" dur="3.45">so let&amp;#39;s go again and another one of</text>
  <text start="33.6" dur="5.34">these passages and that&amp;#39;s Romans chapter</text>
  <text start="35.37" dur="6.09">14 again we need to remember my first</text>
  <text start="38.94" dur="5">video outlined three principles to keep</text>
  <text start="41.46" dur="5.009">in mind and one of those principles was</text>
  <text start="43.94" dur="4.36">what Peter said about Paul&amp;#39;s writings</text>
  <text start="46.469" dur="3.781">which is sometimes Paul writes in ways</text>
  <text start="48.3" dur="3.329">that are hard to be understood so I</text>
  <text start="50.25" dur="4.68">really need to put our thinking caps on</text>
  <text start="51.629" dur="6.151">and discern discern what Paul is trying</text>
  <text start="54.93" dur="6.24">to say what his intent is so starting at</text>
  <text start="57.78" dur="5.88">the very beginning of Romans 14 him that</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="6.03">is weak in the faith receive ye but not</text>
  <text start="63.66" dur="5.58">to doubtful disputations for one believe</text>
  <text start="67.2" dur="4.95">us that he may eat all things in another</text>
  <text start="69.24" dur="4.919">who&amp;#39;s weak eateth herbs okay so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="72.15" dur="3.359">contrasting someone who is a vegetarian</text>
  <text start="74.159" dur="2.791">and someone who&amp;#39;s not a vegetarian</text>
  <text start="75.509" dur="3.781">that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s doing here at the</text>
  <text start="76.95" dur="4.919">outset basically this would be like a</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="3.99">personal conviction a personal scruple</text>
  <text start="81.869" dur="3.661">has nothing to do with the commandments</text>
  <text start="83.28" dur="5.37">of yah it has to do with whether you can</text>
  <text start="85.53" dur="6.6">eat all that biblically would be defined</text>
  <text start="88.65" dur="5.88">as food or whether someone wants to only</text>
  <text start="92.13" dur="5.489">eat vegetables wants to be a vegetarian</text>
  <text start="94.53" dur="5.22">and basically if all saying look these</text>
  <text start="97.619" dur="3.511">are personal scruples between believers</text>
  <text start="99.75" dur="5.28">and this is not something that you</text>
  <text start="101.13" dur="5.34">should judge each other about okay in no</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="3.57">way is bringing up whether we should eat</text>
  <text start="106.47" dur="9.06">pork or shellfish can remember Paul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="108.6" dur="9.479">writing as a a Jew and he would never</text>
  <text start="115.53" dur="4.65">consider pork or shellfish food okay</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="4.83">wouldn&amp;#39;t wouldn&amp;#39;t ever be considered his</text>
  <text start="120.18" dur="5.039">food so when he says he that eats all</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="4.421">things he means eating those things</text>
  <text start="125.219" dur="3.971">which are biblically defined as food</text>
  <text start="127.33" dur="6.39">which you can find in Leviticus chapter</text>
  <text start="129.19" dur="8.85">11 let not him that eat the spice and</text>
  <text start="133.72" dur="6.39">eats not and let not him which eats not</text>
  <text start="138.04" dur="4.47">judge him that eats for yaja received</text>
  <text start="140.11" dur="4.41">him so who are you that judges another</text>
  <text start="142.51" dur="3.36">man&amp;#39;s servant to his own master he</text>
  <text start="144.52" dur="2.91">stands or falls yeah he should be</text>
  <text start="145.87" dur="3.9">holding up for yah double then they can</text>
  <text start="147.43" dur="5">be stand so again he&amp;#39;s saying look if</text>
  <text start="149.77" dur="6.39">someone&amp;#39;s a vegetarian and someone&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="4.93">this is this is not in any way has</text>
  <text start="156.16" dur="2.76">anything to do with the commandments of</text>
  <text start="157.36" dur="3.09">the Aziz our personal convictions and</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="5.28">scruples don&amp;#39;t be judging each other</text>
  <text start="160.45" dur="7.26">about that now in verse 5 he kind of</text>
  <text start="164.2" dur="5.19">switches into a new a new idea that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167.71" dur="4.5">related this idea of personal</text>
  <text start="169.39" dur="5.4">convictions he says one man esteems one</text>
  <text start="172.21" dur="4.8">day above another and another esteemeth</text>
  <text start="174.79" dur="5.13">every day alike let every man be fully</text>
  <text start="177.01" dur="4.98">persuaded in his own mind he that</text>
  <text start="179.92" dur="4.29">regards the day regards it unto Yahweh</text>
  <text start="181.99" dur="4.86">and he the regards not the day to Yahweh</text>
  <text start="184.21" dur="4.53">he does not regard it he that he eats to</text>
  <text start="186.85" dur="4.41">Yahweh for he gives me off thanks and he</text>
  <text start="188.74" dur="3.99">that he&amp;#39;s not the yah he heats not and</text>
  <text start="191.26" dur="3.69">gives God thanks now what is Paul</text>
  <text start="192.73" dur="4.52">talking about here he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="194.95" dur="5.31">specific days in which there were</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="6.01">personal convictions about not to eat in</text>
  <text start="200.26" dur="4.77">certain days where you could eat these</text>
  <text start="203.26" dur="3.3">were basically the fasting</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="5.459">these are fast days that are talked</text>
  <text start="206.56" dur="4.52">about in Zechariah chapter 7 verse 5 and</text>
  <text start="210.489" dur="3.241">6</text>
  <text start="211.08" dur="4.87">they were anniversary fasts that were</text>
  <text start="213.73" dur="4.8">observed during the Jews captivity in</text>
  <text start="215.95" dur="4.259">Babylon and there were four traditional</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="3.66">fast days that are mentioned in</text>
  <text start="220.209" dur="4.141">Zechariah one was the fast of the fourth</text>
  <text start="222.19" dur="4.92">month that&amp;#39;s in remembrance of the</text>
  <text start="224.35" dur="4.77">breaking of the wall of Jerusalem the</text>
  <text start="227.11" dur="3.9">second fast was the fastest fifth month</text>
  <text start="229.12" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s in remembrance of the burning of</text>
  <text start="231.01" dur="5.04">the temple there&amp;#39;s the fast of the</text>
  <text start="233.38" dur="4.23">seventh month which is not Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="236.05" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s actually in remembrance of the</text>
  <text start="237.61" dur="4.77">killing of Gedaliah which completed the</text>
  <text start="239.83" dur="4.14">dispersion and then there&amp;#39;s the fourth</text>
  <text start="242.38" dur="3.66">the fast of the tenth months and</text>
  <text start="243.97" dur="3.67">remember to the beginning of the siege</text>
  <text start="246.04" dur="3.67">of Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="247.64" dur="5.67">so these are all mentioned in Zechariah</text>
  <text start="249.71" dur="6.12">chapter seven five through six and even</text>
  <text start="253.31" dur="6.69">amongst the Jews of the first century it</text>
  <text start="255.83" dur="7.41">was not agreed upon whether you had to</text>
  <text start="260" dur="5.07">fast summons days or not so what Paul is</text>
  <text start="263.24" dur="4.02">saying is saying look if you think you</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="4.5">need to fast on those days then do it if</text>
  <text start="267.26" dur="4.14">you don&amp;#39;t feel like you need to fast</text>
  <text start="269.57" dur="3.81">those days then don&amp;#39;t do it again this</text>
  <text start="271.4" dur="4.59">is involving personal scruples and</text>
  <text start="273.38" dur="5.07">conviction notice Paul never ever ever</text>
  <text start="275.99" dur="5.46">ever mentions the Sabbath day he never</text>
  <text start="278.45" dur="5.25">talks about Shabbat here he&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="281.45" dur="5.58">about this whole chapters about personal</text>
  <text start="283.7" dur="6.45">convictions personal scruples all right</text>
  <text start="287.03" dur="5.73">moving on for none of us liveth to</text>
  <text start="290.15" dur="4.71">himself and no man dieth to himself for</text>
  <text start="292.76" dur="4.05">whether we live we live unto Yahweh and</text>
  <text start="294.86" dur="4.38">whether we die we dine it to Yahweh</text>
  <text start="296.81" dur="5.31">whether we live therefore or die we are</text>
  <text start="299.24" dur="5.25">Yahweh&amp;#39;s for to this end Messiah both</text>
  <text start="302.12" dur="5.1">died and rose and revived that he might</text>
  <text start="304.49" dur="5.88">be yabo to the dead and the living</text>
  <text start="307.22" dur="5.85">but why do you judge your brother why do</text>
  <text start="310.37" dur="4.26">you put a wide us out said it not your</text>
  <text start="313.07" dur="4.38">brother but we shall all stand before</text>
  <text start="314.63" dur="5.34">the judgment seat of Messiah so again</text>
  <text start="317.45" dur="5.7">there was this problem amongst the</text>
  <text start="319.97" dur="5.19">congregation here in Rome where they</text>
  <text start="323.15" dur="3.75">were saying oh look you know he has this</text>
  <text start="325.16" dur="5.009">personal conviction to eat only</text>
  <text start="326.9" dur="5.34">vegetables that&amp;#39;s crazy you know this is</text>
  <text start="330.169" dur="4.981">stupid and they were judging each other</text>
  <text start="332.24" dur="4.29">and then they had this conviction of</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="3.09">well we need to make sure we observe</text>
  <text start="336.53" dur="3.78">these fast days we should not we should</text>
  <text start="338.24" dur="4.32">regard this on to yawn and not eat on</text>
  <text start="340.31" dur="4.95">this day and others are saying no no</text>
  <text start="342.56" dur="4.23">that those are just optional we we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="345.26" dur="4.14">have to regard that under Yahweh we can</text>
  <text start="346.79" dur="4.62">eat on those days again Paul saying look</text>
  <text start="349.4" dur="3.74">these things are traditions these things</text>
  <text start="351.41" dur="5.64">are personal convictions and scruples</text>
  <text start="353.14" dur="5.71">and so it has nothing to do with keeping</text>
  <text start="357.05" dur="3.21">the tour it has to do with personal</text>
  <text start="358.85" dur="3.51">convictions and scruples that people</text>
  <text start="360.26" dur="5.15">were having as to whether to follow</text>
  <text start="362.36" dur="3.05">certain traditions or not</text>
  <text start="366.22" dur="8.4">okay so picking up in verse 14 I know it</text>
  <text start="371.56" dur="6.57">and unpersuaded by Adana Yahshua but</text>
  <text start="374.62" dur="5.1">there is nothing unclean of itself but</text>
  <text start="378.13" dur="5.04">to him that has seen anything to be</text>
  <text start="379.72" dur="4.44">unclean to him it is unclean ah so</text>
  <text start="383.17" dur="5.01">Christians look at that and say look</text>
  <text start="384.16" dur="5.94">nothing is unclean of itself you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="388.18" dur="4.8">say pig or shellfish or anything that is</text>
  <text start="390.1" dur="5.28">unclean well that is not what Paul is</text>
  <text start="392.98" dur="8.51">saying in fact if we go to the Greek</text>
  <text start="395.38" dur="8.73">word that is used in that passage it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.49" dur="6.58">look this up here that Greek word in</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="6.87">verse 14 is coyness and this Greek word</text>
  <text start="408.07" dur="4.77">means ordinary and is usually translated</text>
  <text start="410.98" dur="5.91">common or means something that has been</text>
  <text start="412.84" dur="6.3">made or designated unclean now this is</text>
  <text start="416.89" dur="5.3">referring the Jews have this tradition</text>
  <text start="419.14" dur="7.47">where they would call even clean food</text>
  <text start="422.19" dur="6.43">you&amp;#39;d have lamb or you would have you</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="4.26">know beef some sort of clean food but</text>
  <text start="428.62" dur="5.52">because it hadn&amp;#39;t gone through this</text>
  <text start="430.87" dur="5.54">complex ritual that the Jews have</text>
  <text start="434.14" dur="5.25">established to make it so-called</text>
  <text start="436.41" dur="5.65">rabbinic li clean they considered it</text>
  <text start="439.39" dur="5.43">common or unclean okay now it was still</text>
  <text start="442.06" dur="4.32">clean food according to Scripture but</text>
  <text start="444.82" dur="4.32">because it hasn&amp;#39;t gone through all these</text>
  <text start="446.38" dur="6.15">rabbinic checks and things they</text>
  <text start="449.14" dur="4.74">considered it unclean or common that is</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="5.34">the Greek word that is being used in</text>
  <text start="453.88" dur="6.03">Romans 14 14 this word is found in 10 of</text>
  <text start="457.87" dur="4.14">the verses all through the New Testament</text>
  <text start="459.91" dur="3.98">but only in Romans 14 14 is it</text>
  <text start="462.01" dur="6.09">translated unclean it should actually be</text>
  <text start="463.89" dur="6.79">translated common another related record</text>
  <text start="468.1" dur="3.78">is coined that has a similar meaning of</text>
  <text start="470.68" dur="4.47">something that has been made or</text>
  <text start="471.88" dur="5.76">designated unclean that is not an end of</text>
  <text start="475.15" dur="4.47">itself normally unclean and 11 other</text>
  <text start="477.64" dur="6.93">verses this word is not translated as</text>
  <text start="479.62" dur="6.33">unclean now there is a word that is that</text>
  <text start="484.57" dur="4.44">it means unclean</text>
  <text start="485.95" dur="5.31">it occurs in 28 places in the New</text>
  <text start="489.01" dur="5.219">Testament it&amp;#39;s the Greek word act a</text>
  <text start="491.26" dur="4.68">catharsis and this greek word means</text>
  <text start="494.229" dur="2.381">something that in and of itself of</text>
  <text start="495.94" dur="2.05">unclean</text>
  <text start="496.61" dur="4.26">Fame that&amp;#39;s always used to refer to</text>
  <text start="497.99" dur="5.459">Devils or to animals that Yahweh has</text>
  <text start="500.87" dur="7.47">identified as unclean but this is not</text>
  <text start="503.449" dur="7.351">the word Paul used in Romans 14 14 again</text>
  <text start="508.34" dur="3.96">the Jews had added a designation to the</text>
  <text start="510.8" dur="3.51">clean food laws of Scripture that was</text>
  <text start="512.3" dur="4.619">not in Scripture and that designation</text>
  <text start="514.31" dur="4.169">was common animals these are animals</text>
  <text start="516.919" dur="3.841">that are clean animals that Judaism</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="4.05">liberal labeled unfit because they came</text>
  <text start="520.76" dur="5.22">from a Gentile source or did not meet a</text>
  <text start="522.529" dur="5.611">standard established by men of Judea and</text>
  <text start="525.98" dur="3.72">that this again this ties back to Acts</text>
  <text start="528.14" dur="3.449">chapter 10 that&amp;#39;s why Peter and division</text>
  <text start="529.7" dur="5.509">of accent told the almighty I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="531.589" dur="5.791">seen anything that is common or unclean</text>
  <text start="535.209" dur="4.511">there&amp;#39;s actually no scriptural</text>
  <text start="537.38" dur="5.34">prohibition against that which is common</text>
  <text start="539.72" dur="6.33">okay that is what Paul was addressing in</text>
  <text start="542.72" dur="6.33">Romans 14 14 nothing is common of itself</text>
  <text start="546.05" dur="5.37">and that is an added designation by man</text>
  <text start="549.05" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s not from young that&amp;#39;s why Paul</text>
  <text start="551.42" dur="6.72">followed this writing with to him who</text>
  <text start="554.57" dur="5.759">accounts anything to be common to the</text>
  <text start="558.14" dur="6.03">individual if someone thinks I was</text>
  <text start="560.329" dur="6.57">common I shouldn&amp;#39;t eat it then to him</text>
  <text start="564.17" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s common and he shouldn&amp;#39;t eat it but</text>
  <text start="566.899" dur="3.87">the individual is so designated</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="3.84">something who&amp;#39;s not so designate</text>
  <text start="570.769" dur="3.211">something common because again scripture</text>
  <text start="572.57" dur="3.57">has nothing to say about whether you can</text>
  <text start="573.98" dur="6">eat common food or not then it&amp;#39;s okay to</text>
  <text start="576.14" dur="7.189">eat so again this is another personal</text>
  <text start="579.98" dur="3.349">scruple or conviction</text>
  <text start="584.14" dur="5.5">Paul is bringing about these things</text>
  <text start="587.48" dur="3.87">because what&amp;#39;s happening is and this was</text>
  <text start="589.64" dur="5.129">the big problem in the first century was</text>
  <text start="591.35" dur="5.52">that the first century Jews had mixed</text>
  <text start="594.769" dur="4.171">Torah with a lot of their traditions</text>
  <text start="596.87" dur="4.8">with a lot of their man-made traditions</text>
  <text start="598.94" dur="5.04">and so Paul is trying to untangle that</text>
  <text start="601.67" dur="5.46">through the using the spirit of Yong</text>
  <text start="603.98" dur="5.31">and so again verse 14 should be more</text>
  <text start="607.13" dur="4.89">accurately translated I know and it</text>
  <text start="609.29" dur="5.67">persuaded by Adonai a schwa that there</text>
  <text start="612.02" dur="5.01">is nothing common of itself to him that</text>
  <text start="614.96" dur="6.06">it seems anything to be common to him it</text>
  <text start="617.03" dur="6.6">is common all right but if your brother</text>
  <text start="621.02" dur="4.8">be grieved by your meat now walkest down</text>
  <text start="623.63" dur="5.13">off charitably destroy not him with thy</text>
  <text start="625.82" dur="4.29">meat for whom Messiah died so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="628.76" dur="3.36">eating with someone and they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="630.11" dur="4.14">look that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s common you know you</text>
  <text start="632.12" dur="4.08">shouldn&amp;#39;t be eating that then you know</text>
  <text start="634.25" dur="5.79">be charitable like okay I won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="636.2" dur="6.21">I won&amp;#39;t eat that so this has nothing to</text>
  <text start="640.04" dur="4.98">do with whether to eat pork or shellfish</text>
  <text start="642.41" dur="5.4">whether to eat unclean animals nothing</text>
  <text start="645.02" dur="6.96">to do whatsoever okay this has to do</text>
  <text start="647.81" dur="5.91">with traditions of men and personal</text>
  <text start="651.98" dur="5.07">convictions and scruples that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="653.72" dur="6.03">Romans 14 is about now Christians will</text>
  <text start="657.05" dur="4.14">try to read this patch and say look see</text>
  <text start="659.75" dur="4.29">Paul saying we don&amp;#39;t need to keep your</text>
  <text start="661.19" dur="6.09">Shabbat look Paul saying all these foods</text>
  <text start="664.04" dur="5.34">are clean that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="667.28" dur="6.48">okay it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="669.38" dur="7.05">whatsoever because first of all Paul</text>
  <text start="673.76" dur="5.31">never talks about the Sabbath day that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="676.43" dur="5.61">a commandment from Scripture Paul never</text>
  <text start="679.07" dur="4.71">refers to unclean animals</text>
  <text start="682.04" dur="3.09">pork I&amp;#39;m sure he never he never points</text>
  <text start="683.78" dur="5.25">that out never brings it out and that</text>
  <text start="685.13" dur="9.06">wasn&amp;#39;t that wasn&amp;#39;t the issue the issue</text>
  <text start="689.03" dur="7.02">is making sure that we are not judging</text>
  <text start="694.19" dur="3.47">each other based off of personal</text>
  <text start="696.05" dur="3.66">convictions and scruples if you have a</text>
  <text start="697.66" dur="5.53">conviction too fast</text>
  <text start="699.71" dur="5.19">every Wednesday then that&amp;#39;s great okay</text>
  <text start="703.19" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s wonderful now you shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="704.9" dur="3.69">impose that on somebody else but if you</text>
  <text start="707.15" dur="2.79">have that personal conviction and</text>
  <text start="708.59" dur="3.36">scruple then you should do that</text>
  <text start="709.94" dur="4.71">and so Paul is basically saying look</text>
  <text start="711.95" dur="4.47">charity needs to rule in your hearts</text>
  <text start="714.65" dur="3.33">when it comes to believers coming</text>
  <text start="716.42" dur="3.66">together and having different personal</text>
  <text start="717.98" dur="4.14">convictions and scruples</text>
  <text start="720.08" dur="4.47">one brother may be weaker in the faith</text>
  <text start="722.12" dur="4.53">and may only be able to eat vegetables</text>
  <text start="724.55" dur="3.96">you can&amp;#39;t you can&amp;#39;t eat meat and if</text>
  <text start="726.65" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s the case then walk and charity</text>
  <text start="728.51" dur="3.429">and be charitable toward that brother</text>
  <text start="730.04" dur="3.609">don&amp;#39;t be like oh you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="731.939" dur="3.27">stupid and dumb and you know I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="733.649" dur="4.59">believe that you&amp;#39;re only you know eating</text>
  <text start="735.209" dur="4.261">vegetables no that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not how</text>
  <text start="738.239" dur="5.88">we should be walking at all</text>
  <text start="739.47" dur="6.869">so Romans 14 it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a very very</text>
  <text start="744.119" dur="3.78">clear passage about personal convictions</text>
  <text start="746.339" dur="4.35">personal scruples having to do with</text>
  <text start="747.899" dur="6.321">various past days having to do with food</text>
  <text start="750.689" dur="6.75">that was designated common okay by</text>
  <text start="754.22" dur="5.409">rabbis by the first century Jews but</text>
  <text start="757.439" dur="5.1">weren&amp;#39;t it wasn&amp;#39;t necessarily unclean</text>
  <text start="759.629" dur="4.26">food and again when you go back actually</text>
  <text start="762.539" dur="4.32">to the Greek word that&amp;#39;s being used</text>
  <text start="763.889" dur="5.88">there that&amp;#39;s very very clear all right</text>
  <text start="766.859" dur="5.52">well this is part five of 17 Romans 14</text>
  <text start="769.769" dur="4.56">hope this is a blessing and with you</text>
