  <text start="44.34" dur="6.36">Hebrew month and so I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="49.079" dur="3.271">make a real quick follow-up video on</text>
  <text start="50.7" dur="4.35">yesterday&amp;#39;s video because I know a lot</text>
  <text start="52.35" dur="4.439">of people got pretty upset with me and a</text>
  <text start="55.05" dur="4.47">lot of people threatened to unsubscribe</text>
  <text start="56.789" dur="4.351">from me although I don&amp;#39;t know I mean</text>
  <text start="59.52" dur="2.879">either those people were bluffing or</text>
  <text start="61.14" dur="2.97">just didn&amp;#39;t matter because the more</text>
  <text start="62.399" dur="3.991">people that said they were unsub in me I</text>
  <text start="64.11" dur="4.32">checked my subscriptions and they just</text>
  <text start="66.39" dur="4.68">kept skyrocketing I&amp;#39;m almost up to</text>
  <text start="68.43" dur="5.939">11,000 now so I guess it&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="71.07" dur="6.45">hurting my numbers okay so judge</text>
  <text start="74.369" dur="5.341">Cavanaugh so first of all if you folks</text>
  <text start="77.52" dur="5.01">when you say things and I got several</text>
  <text start="79.71" dur="5.01">comments Ishay said well if Hillary</text>
  <text start="82.53" dur="4.589">Clinton&amp;#39;s against him then I&amp;#39;m gonna be</text>
  <text start="84.72" dur="4.92">for him if that&amp;#39;s your level of critical</text>
  <text start="87.119" dur="4.351">thinking seriously you are dumb you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="3.57">just an idiot okay usually like you</text>
  <text start="91.47" dur="5.399">shouldn&amp;#39;t be watching my videos go ahead</text>
  <text start="93.21" dur="5.28">and unsub just move along okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="2.54">just dumb that&amp;#39;s just not that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="3.629">stupid</text>
  <text start="99.409" dur="5.291">Hillary has her own reasons for opposing</text>
  <text start="102.119" dur="5.911">Cavanaugh so to the Democrats there they</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="5.43">are very wicked motivations they have</text>
  <text start="108.03" dur="3.99">other reasons for opposing him mainly</text>
  <text start="110.13" dur="4.44">because Conda has a bunch of dirt on her</text>
  <text start="112.02" dur="4.919">and Hillary would much rather hurt him</text>
  <text start="114.57" dur="4.079">be some obscure federal judge than to</text>
  <text start="116.939" dur="3.93">have the power of a Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="118.649" dur="4.08">justice because if he has that much</text>
  <text start="120.869" dur="4.5">power he does pose a significant threat</text>
  <text start="122.729" dur="4.32">to Hillary so Hillary doesn&amp;#39;t want him</text>
  <text start="125.369" dur="5.101">to have all this power because he knows</text>
  <text start="127.049" dur="4.711">a lot of dirt on Hillary okay so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.47" dur="3.28">the bottom line on that that&amp;#39;s why she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.76" dur="5.44">opposed to him it has nothing to</text>
  <text start="133.75" dur="5.52">with any noble reason okay but again</text>
  <text start="137.2" dur="3.63">just because Hillary the Dems oppose him</text>
  <text start="139.27" dur="4.14">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we should support</text>
  <text start="140.83" dur="5.46">this guy okay so I&amp;#39;m gonna I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="143.41" dur="5.13">just do what Q does which Q always says</text>
  <text start="146.29" dur="3.75">he wants you know you Patriots the Jews</text>
  <text start="148.54" dur="3.78">research right so I&amp;#39;m gonna I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="150.04" dur="4.23">kind of act like Q here for a moment I</text>
  <text start="152.32" dur="4.65">want you to do some research and I want</text>
  <text start="154.27" dur="6.3">you to find some video of when Trump</text>
  <text start="156.97" dur="5.13">nominated the first Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="160.57" dur="5.91">justice that he put up remember Neil</text>
  <text start="162.1" dur="7.26">Neil Neil Neil G will call him you guys</text>
  <text start="166.48" dur="5.97">know what up talk about I want you to go</text>
  <text start="169.36" dur="5.04">look at some video maybe find it on</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="3.9">YouTube or whatnot and looking from</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="4.83">spotter language when he he brought</text>
  <text start="176.35" dur="4.32">forth that nomination and then compare</text>
  <text start="179.23" dur="5.43">that to his body language when he</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="6.89">brought out Cavanaugh just compare and</text>
  <text start="184.66" dur="6.329">you tell me if there isn&amp;#39;t a difference</text>
  <text start="187.56" dur="5.98">okay our buddy Neil he&amp;#39;s a good guy he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.989" dur="4.771">a white hat he&amp;#39;s pro-life he&amp;#39;s Pro</text>
  <text start="193.54" dur="5.13">Constitution he&amp;#39;s a good guy he will he</text>
  <text start="195.76" dur="5.699">will definitely not rule against any</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="5.31">type of motion to go again he will</text>
  <text start="201.459" dur="5.101">definite in favor of the pedophiles or</text>
  <text start="203.98" dur="4.17">rule or try to protect pedophiles like</text>
  <text start="206.56" dur="3.59">like Cavanaugh does</text>
  <text start="208.15" dur="5.1">[Applause]</text>
  <text start="210.15" dur="4.78">I&amp;#39;m telling you Trump Trump was</text>
  <text start="213.25" dur="3.63">blackmailed now people don&amp;#39;t like me to</text>
  <text start="214.93" dur="3.57">say that because that means that trumps</text>
  <text start="216.88" dur="2.88">I&amp;#39;m out did something wrong no that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.5" dur="3.48">not what it means I&amp;#39;m not gonna go into</text>
  <text start="219.76" dur="4.08">the details of how he was blackmailed</text>
  <text start="221.98" dur="4.8">but I will tell you Trump did nothing</text>
  <text start="223.84" dur="5.07">wrong he&amp;#39;s innocent but the blackmail</text>
  <text start="226.78" dur="6.989">involves a piece of information that</text>
  <text start="228.91" dur="6.93">would give the appearance of evil and it</text>
  <text start="233.769" dur="3.871">would really damage his credibility it</text>
  <text start="235.84" dur="3.899">would it with the the MSM would have a</text>
  <text start="237.64" dur="5.069">field day and and the average Joe out</text>
  <text start="239.739" dur="4.141">there that&amp;#39;s not discerning would really</text>
  <text start="242.709" dur="3.481">start scratching their heads and</text>
  <text start="243.88" dur="3.87">wondering if Trump&amp;#39;s really a good guy</text>
  <text start="246.19" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the appearance of evil and</text>
  <text start="247.75" dur="3.75">Trump doesn&amp;#39;t want that out so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.43" dur="3.809">what they&amp;#39;re blackmailing him with now</text>
  <text start="251.5" dur="3.54">people have said well if if they</text>
  <text start="253.239" dur="2.881">blackmail them about this why don&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="2.4">blackmail him about a bunch of other</text>
  <text start="256.12" dur="2.7">stuff well first of all you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="257.44" dur="3.84">what other stuff they might be</text>
  <text start="258.82" dur="3.84">blackmailing him over and the second of</text>
  <text start="261.28" dur="3.15">all these people who are blackmailing</text>
  <text start="262.66" dur="2.52">him they&amp;#39;re in the process of being</text>
  <text start="264.43" dur="1.51">blackmailed</text>
  <text start="265.18" dur="3.67">themselves</text>
  <text start="265.94" dur="4.68">okay so there&amp;#39;s sort of a limited amount</text>
  <text start="268.85" dur="5.34">of leverage that that everyone has right</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="5.55">now one of the problems is that Trump is</text>
  <text start="274.19" dur="3.33">having right now in terms of going after</text>
  <text start="276.17" dur="3.39">the pedophiles I&amp;#39;m making the high</text>
  <text start="277.52" dur="4.11">profile rest is is there is some</text>
  <text start="279.56" dur="5.52">blackmail going on and what Q is</text>
  <text start="281.63" dur="5.31">attempting to do is to release all the</text>
  <text start="285.08" dur="5.34">information that he&amp;#39;s amassed over the</text>
  <text start="286.94" dur="6.09">last 25 years on these pedophiles so</text>
  <text start="290.42" dur="5.01">that once they&amp;#39;re exposed they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="293.03" dur="4.08">really have any type of leverage in</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="7.02">terms of being able to blackmail Trump</text>
  <text start="297.11" dur="7.26">so so that&amp;#39;s what Q is working on now</text>
  <text start="302.45" dur="3.33">just ask yourself if you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="304.37" dur="2.85">believe anything I&amp;#39;ve said about judge</text>
  <text start="305.78" dur="4.02">Cavanaugh being involved with Vince</text>
  <text start="307.22" dur="5.07">Foster&amp;#39;s death and covering up for Bill</text>
  <text start="309.8" dur="4.74">and Hillary and being a lap dog for bush</text>
  <text start="312.29" dur="3.51">senior put aside all that stuff and I</text>
  <text start="314.54" dur="3.18">want you to just look at the history</text>
  <text start="315.8" dur="7.02">that&amp;#39;s verified okay that you can verify</text>
  <text start="317.72" dur="7.5">about Cavanaugh okay the guy is a neocon</text>
  <text start="322.82" dur="5.61">he is he is completely in the hands of</text>
  <text start="325.22" dur="6.36">bush senior he&amp;#39;s in the the Friends of</text>
  <text start="328.43" dur="5.67">machine or Bush jr. he&amp;#39;s a bush eye why</text>
  <text start="331.58" dur="5.19">are we people who supposedly are</text>
  <text start="334.1" dur="5.94">supporting Trump why are we all getting</text>
  <text start="336.77" dur="5.1">behind this neocon bush I okay you got</text>
  <text start="340.04" dur="5.46">to ask yourself that why do we want a</text>
  <text start="341.87" dur="6.18">neocon Bush site bush dynasty era guy on</text>
  <text start="345.5" dur="4.35">the Supreme Court for life I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="348.05" dur="3.75">that why would you want that so ask</text>
  <text start="349.85" dur="5.1">yourself that okay let&amp;#39;s do some</text>
  <text start="351.8" dur="4.44">critical thinking now there are a</text>
  <text start="354.95" dur="4.11">hundred thousand documents that the</text>
  <text start="356.24" dur="4.29">White House has on Neil Kavanagh those a</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="2.97">lot of thousand documents actually do</text>
  <text start="360.53" dur="5.13">prove everything I&amp;#39;ve been saying about</text>
  <text start="362.03" dur="6.48">is him being implicated Cavanaugh being</text>
  <text start="365.66" dur="6.99">implicated and Vince Foster&amp;#39;s murder etc</text>
  <text start="368.51" dur="5.76">etc now how someone pointed out to me</text>
  <text start="372.65" dur="3.72">that the story that Drudge released</text>
  <text start="374.27" dur="4.89">yesterday showed that the White House</text>
  <text start="376.37" dur="4.35">only released 42,000 documents this is</text>
  <text start="379.16" dur="3.84">why the Democrats like Camilla Harris</text>
  <text start="380.72" dur="3.66">are saying hey we need to put a stop to</text>
  <text start="383" dur="3.24">this hearing until we have time to</text>
  <text start="384.38" dur="4.44">review those 42 thousand documents now I</text>
  <text start="386.24" dur="4.11">want you to ask yourself something why</text>
  <text start="388.82" dur="3.63">would the White House only release</text>
  <text start="390.35" dur="5.619">42,000 documents of the hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="392.45" dur="5.989">documents why why</text>
  <text start="395.969" dur="4.45">I&amp;#39;m telling you why because Trump is</text>
  <text start="398.439" dur="3.871">being blackmailed and he&amp;#39;s not he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="400.419" dur="6.451">able to release all hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="402.31" dur="7.02">documents however what I&amp;#39;ve been told is</text>
  <text start="406.87" dur="4.41">that he&amp;#39;s hoping that with these</text>
  <text start="409.33" dur="3.57">confirmation hearings enough pressure is</text>
  <text start="411.28" dur="3.12">going to come from the Democrats and</text>
  <text start="412.9" dur="4.47">hopefully the American people like</text>
  <text start="414.4" dur="4.919">yourself to pressure Trump in the White</text>
  <text start="417.37" dur="3.21">House to release 100,000 documents so</text>
  <text start="419.319" dur="3.481">that even if Trump&amp;#39;s being blackmailed</text>
  <text start="420.58" dur="4.829">he&amp;#39;s gonna be forced to release the</text>
  <text start="422.8" dur="3.869">documents he wants basically his goal</text>
  <text start="425.409" dur="2.79">with these confirmation hearings is he</text>
  <text start="426.669" dur="3.9">wants all hundred thousand documents</text>
  <text start="428.199" dur="4.52">released so that it will become public</text>
  <text start="430.569" dur="4.231">knowledge that cabinet is a criminal</text>
  <text start="432.719" dur="4.901">that he was involved with the murder of</text>
  <text start="434.8" dur="5.07">Vince Foster and that way</text>
  <text start="437.62" dur="4.139">Cavanaugh will be forced to withdraw and</text>
  <text start="439.87" dur="3.93">hopefully arrested but forced to</text>
  <text start="441.759" dur="5.34">withdraw and then Trump can bring out an</text>
  <text start="443.8" dur="5.369">actual really good nomination for</text>
  <text start="447.099" dur="3.741">Supreme Court justice someone who</text>
  <text start="449.169" dur="5.671">doesn&amp;#39;t have ties to the Bush cabal</text>
  <text start="450.84" dur="7.96">someone who&amp;#39;s pro-life and procon</text>
  <text start="454.84" dur="6.87">stitute and who will who will be someone</text>
  <text start="458.8" dur="4.549">who if the Supreme Court gets called</text>
  <text start="461.71" dur="5.179">into any type of case involving</text>
