  <text start="160.76" dur="6.25">hopefully my hands are not covering up</text>
  <text start="163.05" dur="7.83">the speaker um so there was a subscriber</text>
  <text start="167.01" dur="6.15">a little over a year ago back in the</text>
  <text start="170.88" dur="4.47">fall of 2017 that had recommended an</text>
  <text start="173.16" dur="3.24">idea that I didn&amp;#39;t pursue at the time</text>
  <text start="175.35" dur="4.71">just because I had so much other stuff</text>
  <text start="176.4" dur="5.73">going on and he had recommended that I</text>
  <text start="180.06" dur="4.709">start sending these mass emails out to</text>
  <text start="182.13" dur="4.22">different churches and pastors and</text>
  <text start="184.769" dur="3.931">denominations across the United States</text>
  <text start="186.35" dur="5.26">with just a short email about Who I am</text>
  <text start="188.7" dur="4.59">my ministry and how I like to teach</text>
  <text start="191.61" dur="5.58">Christians about the Hebrew Jewish reads</text>
  <text start="193.29" dur="6.36">to the Christian faith and you know I</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="4.29">kind of I kind of said well okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.65" dur="4.02">interesting but I just thought well most</text>
  <text start="201.48" dur="5.58">most pastors are gonna either not</text>
  <text start="203.67" dur="4.98">respond or not be interested but now</text>
  <text start="207.06" dur="4.1">that we&amp;#39;re in this awakening revival</text>
  <text start="208.65" dur="6.03">type of at least the beginning of</text>
  <text start="211.16" dur="5.29">revival awakening type of movement I</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="2.64">thought maybe I should try that maybe I</text>
  <text start="216.45" dur="3.629">should do that</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="4.38">you know after Shabbat sober just start</text>
  <text start="220.079" dur="2.791">going to different websites of churches</text>
  <text start="221.7" dur="2.34">across the United States and sending</text>
  <text start="222.87" dur="2.64">this stuff and say hey if you want me to</text>
  <text start="224.04" dur="4.319">come teach at your church on a Sunday</text>
  <text start="225.51" dur="5">morning and show people about the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="228.359" dur="5.641">Jewish roots of the Christian faith I</text>
  <text start="230.51" dur="4.84">don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s an idea the worst that</text>
  <text start="234" dur="7.859">can happen is they don&amp;#39;t respond or they</text>
  <text start="235.35" dur="8.58">say no I guess I know a lot of pastors</text>
  <text start="241.859" dur="3.571">choose not to want to tell their</text>
  <text start="243.93" dur="2.58">congregations about this because once</text>
  <text start="245.43" dur="3.39">they do it means they have to make</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="3.599">changes they got to change their Sabbath</text>
  <text start="248.82" dur="3.389">from Sunday which is a workday to</text>
  <text start="250.109" dur="3.421">Saturday which is the day that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="252.209" dur="5.661">actually celebrated Sabbath from Friday</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="6.6">evening to Saturday evening and you know</text>
  <text start="257.87" dur="4.87">stop eating that ham stop celebrating</text>
  <text start="260.13" dur="3.93">Xmas and Ishtar Easter start doing the</text>
  <text start="262.74" dur="1.959">Hebrew feast days that Jesus actually</text>
  <text start="264.06" dur="2.62">did</text>
  <text start="264.699" dur="3.511">a lot of change is required and I think</text>
  <text start="266.68" dur="6.199">a lot of pastors say well I&amp;#39;m gonna lose</text>
  <text start="268.21" dur="7.049">all my tithes and money and too scary</text>
  <text start="272.879" dur="5.551">but you never know there may be some</text>
  <text start="275.259" dur="3.171">pastors out there that are willing to</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="8.049">hallelujah praise You Father well I</text>
  <text start="284.59" dur="6.12">wanted to talk a little bit about the</text>
  <text start="286.539" dur="7.321">last chapter of the book of Nehemiah if</text>
  <text start="290.71" dur="6.449">you read that chapter as you go through</text>
  <text start="293.86" dur="7.08">that chapter you see that as evening</text>
  <text start="297.159" dur="7.771">began to settle on Friday night before</text>
  <text start="300.94" dur="6.93">the sunset Nehemia Nehemiah would make</text>
  <text start="304.93" dur="5.01">sure that the gates were closed for</text>
  <text start="307.87" dur="8.16">Jerusalem and no buying or selling was</text>
  <text start="309.94" dur="9.12">being done and they started violating</text>
  <text start="316.03" dur="4.259">this at one point and Nehemiah basically</text>
  <text start="319.06" dur="3.72">threatened to lay hands on them which</text>
  <text start="320.289" dur="4.051">basically means he threatened to hurt</text>
  <text start="322.78" dur="4.59">them physically if they violated the</text>
  <text start="324.34" dur="4.74">Shabbat and you know today some of the</text>
  <text start="327.37" dur="4.139">Americans say oh you&amp;#39;re being so</text>
  <text start="329.08" dur="4.139">legalistic about making sure you keep</text>
  <text start="331.509" dur="5.731">the Sabbath from Friday sundown to</text>
  <text start="333.219" dur="6.391">Saturday sundown but really what</text>
  <text start="337.24" dur="4.44">legalism is is when you follow man-made</text>
  <text start="339.61" dur="4.26">traditions you impose man-made</text>
  <text start="341.68" dur="4.5">traditions on people that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="343.87" dur="3.63">Pharisees and Sadducees did you know</text>
  <text start="346.18" dur="3.12">they said that you couldn&amp;#39;t heal on the</text>
  <text start="347.5" dur="2.94">Sabbath day which was a man-made</text>
  <text start="349.3" dur="3.269">tradition there&amp;#39;s nothing about that in</text>
  <text start="350.44" dur="6.779">Torah fact Torah says you&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="352.569" dur="6.271">do good on the Sabbath ah but in terms</text>
  <text start="357.219" dur="3.721">of keeping the Sabbath you know not</text>
  <text start="358.84" dur="3.6">buying or selling not working from</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="3.75">Friday sundown to Saturday sundown it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="362.44" dur="4.52">it&amp;#39;s not only clear in Torah but in that</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="5.069">last chapter of Nehemiah it&amp;#39;s very clear</text>
  <text start="366.96" dur="5.679">and you know y&amp;#39;all is the same yesterday</text>
  <text start="369.759" dur="5.041">today and forever he doesn&amp;#39;t change we</text>
  <text start="372.639" dur="4.77">are under the new covenant but the new</text>
  <text start="374.8" dur="4.679">covenant still keeps the Torah the only</text>
  <text start="377.409" dur="5.07">difference is that now the blood of</text>
  <text start="379.479" dur="6.06">Messiah covers our sin which is the only</text>
  <text start="382.479" dur="5.37">thing that can and now the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="385.539" dur="6.18">gives us an inward desire to obey the</text>
  <text start="387.849" dur="6.091">very Torah that we formally hated even</text>
  <text start="391.719" dur="5.25">in the first covenant they were looking</text>
  <text start="393.94" dur="4.39">forward to the Messiah and all the blood</text>
  <text start="396.969" dur="6.361">sacrifices were</text>
  <text start="398.33" dur="8.4">toward that atonement Yahshua would make</text>
  <text start="403.33" dur="10.18">on Passover and he did make 2,000 years</text>
  <text start="406.73" dur="8.34">ago but in any case keeping keeping the</text>
  <text start="413.51" dur="3.69">Torah as much as we&amp;#39;re able to in this</text>
  <text start="415.07" dur="3.66">present day society is is definitely</text>
  <text start="417.2" dur="4.38">what we&amp;#39;re supposed to be doing as</text>
  <text start="418.73" dur="4.23">believers even in the Millennial Kingdom</text>
  <text start="421.58" dur="4.59">you&amp;#39;ll see the animal sacrifices</text>
  <text start="422.96" dur="4.71">restored oh there&amp;#39;s an eagle yeah you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="426.17" dur="2.76">see the animal sacrifices restored you</text>
  <text start="427.67" dur="5.13">can read about this in the final four</text>
  <text start="428.93" dur="6.51">chapters of Ezekiel Malachi 3 Zechariah</text>
  <text start="432.8" dur="4.14">14 the animal sacrifices will be</text>
  <text start="435.44" dur="3.27">restored the Levites will be purged and</text>
  <text start="436.94" dur="3.3">restored when when we return with Jesus</text>
  <text start="438.71" dur="4.23">to rule and reign for a thousand years</text>
  <text start="440.24" dur="7.17">and they&amp;#39;ll all point back toward what</text>
  <text start="442.94" dur="6.75">Yahshua did you go to acts 21 Paul many</text>
  <text start="447.41" dur="4.07">years after his conversion to Christ he</text>
  <text start="449.69" dur="4.05">offers an animal sacrifice at the temple</text>
  <text start="451.48" dur="2.89">when he does that Nazarene vow you can</text>
  <text start="453.74" dur="3.63">read about it</text>
  <text start="454.37" dur="5.61">but I encourage all my subscribers to</text>
  <text start="457.37" dur="4.62">read the 17 part series I have right at</text>
  <text start="459.98" dur="4.41">the very top of my website that</text>
  <text start="461.99" dur="4.56">reconciles Torah Messiah and Apostle</text>
  <text start="464.39" dur="3.81">Paul&amp;#39;s teaching a lot of people</text>
  <text start="466.55" dur="6.78">misunderstand what rabbi shallow Apostle</text>
  <text start="468.2" dur="6.98">Paul taught now today we don&amp;#39;t do animal</text>
  <text start="473.33" dur="4.2">sacrifices because there&amp;#39;s no temple</text>
  <text start="475.18" dur="5.38">Torah specifies that once there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="477.53" dur="4.29">temple in Jerusalem actually at first it</text>
  <text start="480.56" dur="3.75">was in Shiloh then it moved to Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="481.82" dur="3.96">that we are to do animal sacrifices but</text>
  <text start="484.31" dur="2.72">there&amp;#39;s no temple in existence today and</text>
  <text start="485.78" dur="5.66">the one that they&amp;#39;re gonna build that</text>
  <text start="487.03" dur="6.43">third temple is gonna be an abomination</text>
  <text start="491.44" dur="3.79">we&amp;#39;re not to have anything to do with it</text>
  <text start="493.46" dur="3.78">because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s gonna be polluted by</text>
  <text start="495.23" dur="3.84">the son of perdition but after we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="497.24" dur="3.3">resurrected after we get our new bodies</text>
  <text start="499.07" dur="3.3">we meet Yasha in the clouds when we</text>
  <text start="500.54" dur="3.75">return Yahshua himself is gonna</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="5.49">reinstate these animal sacrifices and</text>
  <text start="504.29" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;ll all point back toward toward</text>
  <text start="507.86" dur="2.46">Messiah</text>
  <text start="508.82" dur="3.18">during that thousand-year reign and then</text>
  <text start="510.32" dur="3.63">once we get past the thousand-year reign</text>
  <text start="512" dur="4.14">and past Yom Kippur fulfilled at the</text>
  <text start="513.95" dur="3.78">white throne and and actually in the new</text>
  <text start="516.14" dur="3.99">heavens and new earth then at that point</text>
  <text start="517.73" dur="4.05">there is no temple because Yahshua the</text>
  <text start="520.13" dur="4.44">Lamb Yahweh they are the temple they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="521.78" dur="4.29">in and that&amp;#39;s when parts of the Torah do</text>
  <text start="524.57" dur="4.14">pass away we don&amp;#39;t have animal</text>
  <text start="526.07" dur="5.04">sacrifices or death well still keep</text>
  <text start="528.71" dur="3.48">Passover but we won&amp;#39;t kill a lamb to do</text>
  <text start="531.11" dur="2.49">so</text>
  <text start="532.19" dur="3.06">and that&amp;#39;s why Jesus said until heaven</text>
  <text start="533.6" dur="3.239">and earth pass away not one jot or</text>
  <text start="535.25" dur="5.459">tittle matura will pass away</text>
