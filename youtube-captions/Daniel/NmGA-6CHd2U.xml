  <text start="50.67" dur="4.47">keith korean giving a teaching on</text>
  <text start="52.05" dur="5.25">devotion to the Lord to Yahweh back in</text>
  <text start="55.14" dur="4.349">nineteen eighty-two and I watched that a</text>
  <text start="57.3" dur="5.399">few days ago and it&amp;#39;s a very very very</text>
  <text start="59.489" dur="4.801">good teaching I highly recommend it so</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="2.911">today I want to talk about what it means</text>
  <text start="64.29" dur="3.329">to be devoted to Yahweh you know</text>
  <text start="65.61" dur="4.829">everything seems to be spiraling out of</text>
  <text start="67.619" dur="4.021">control in this world we have the</text>
  <text start="70.439" dur="3.961">tensions going on the Middle East</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="4.71">specifically with Syria we have warships</text>
  <text start="74.4" dur="5.1">coming and going throughout the</text>
  <text start="76.35" dur="6.559">Mediterranean the Suez Canal we have</text>
  <text start="79.5" dur="5.909">seems like every day now there are new</text>
  <text start="82.909" dur="5.081">stories about the imminent financial</text>
  <text start="85.409" dur="4.441">collapse and how financial analysts all</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="4.05">across the spectrum are predicting the</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="3.839">collapse of the dollar so all these</text>
  <text start="92.04" dur="3.899">things are happening and I think that</text>
  <text start="93.689" dur="5.011">the most important thing to remember as</text>
  <text start="95.939" dur="4.89">we see all these end times prophecies</text>
  <text start="98.7" dur="4.29">coming to pass before our eyes is to</text>
  <text start="100.829" dur="4.381">keep our eyes or heart centered on</text>
  <text start="102.99" dur="5.73">Yahweh and I want to talk today about</text>
  <text start="105.21" dur="6.21">what true devotion is and what true</text>
  <text start="108.72" dur="6.87">devotion is not a lot of believers tend</text>
  <text start="111.42" dur="6.78">to believe that mmm you know a devotion</text>
  <text start="115.59" dur="5.099">is like your devotional time you get up</text>
  <text start="118.2" dur="4.62">in the morning you open your Bible read</text>
  <text start="120.689" dur="4.011">a chapter to you spend five minutes of</text>
  <text start="122.82" dur="4.63">prayer and then you go about your day or</text>
  <text start="124.7" dur="4.91">maybe your night person and you have a</text>
  <text start="127.45" dur="4.2">quiet time at night where you pray you</text>
  <text start="129.61" dur="5.34">read your scriptures but that is not</text>
  <text start="131.65" dur="5.94">what devotion is that can be an act of</text>
  <text start="134.95" dur="5.22">devotion but it&amp;#39;s not what devotion is</text>
  <text start="137.59" dur="5.789">people can read their Bibles and they</text>
  <text start="140.17" dur="5.88">can even pray thinking a witness and yet</text>
  <text start="143.379" dur="6.451">not have a relationship with Yahshua not</text>
  <text start="146.05" dur="8.159">be devoted to the Messiah so devotion</text>
  <text start="149.83" dur="6.269">does not consist of of the act of</text>
  <text start="154.209" dur="4.681">reading the Bible or the act of prayer</text>
  <text start="156.099" dur="4.831">does not consist of setting aside a time</text>
  <text start="158.89" dur="4.53">in the morning or in the evening to</text>
  <text start="160.93" dur="6.6">spend with Yahweh devotions does not</text>
  <text start="163.42" dur="6.899">consist of emotions or what you might</text>
  <text start="167.53" dur="5.16">think intellectually but none of that</text>
  <text start="170.319" dur="4.111">describes devotion you can do all those</text>
  <text start="172.69" dur="3.96">things you can exhibit all those things</text>
  <text start="174.43" dur="6.48">and still not be devoted to Yahweh so</text>
  <text start="176.65" dur="6">what is devotion well I really like what</text>
  <text start="180.91" dur="3.45">Keith Green talks about in his in his</text>
  <text start="182.65" dur="4.02">YouTube and he&amp;#39;s quoting the great</text>
  <text start="184.36" dur="3.629">evangelist Charles Finney the 19th</text>
  <text start="186.67" dur="2.929">century and if you ever get a chance to</text>
  <text start="187.989" dur="3.9">read the autobiography of Charles Finney</text>
  <text start="189.599" dur="4.061">which I had a chance to read just just</text>
  <text start="191.889" dur="4.921">about a couple months ago it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="193.66" dur="6.18">very good read but what devotion to</text>
  <text start="196.81" dur="5.94">Yahweh is is it&amp;#39;s a full consecration to</text>
  <text start="199.84" dur="5.78">Yahweh it&amp;#39;s the act of the will wholly</text>
  <text start="202.75" dur="6.69">and completely yielded up to yaw to</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="6.13">Yahshua to the Messiah it is every</text>
  <text start="209.44" dur="6.09">waking moment every moment of your life</text>
  <text start="211.75" dur="5.459">is devoted to serving him one of the</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="4.95">points that really like the Keith cream</text>
  <text start="217.209" dur="5.071">makes in the video is you know we tend</text>
  <text start="220.48" dur="4.349">as believers to compartmentalize our</text>
  <text start="222.28" dur="3.78">lives so we have a prayer time or bible</text>
  <text start="224.829" dur="3.03">study in the morning and then it&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="226.06" dur="3.66">then we put that aside and say okay now</text>
  <text start="227.859" dur="3.841">it&amp;#39;s time to go off to work now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="229.72" dur="5.669">time to go to school but that&amp;#39;s not how</text>
  <text start="231.7" dur="6.629">we should be in fact anything we do even</text>
  <text start="235.389" dur="4.35">the most mundane task should be for the</text>
  <text start="238.329" dur="3.511">glory of Yahweh we&amp;#39;re all familiar with</text>
  <text start="239.739" dur="4.321">the scripture that says whatever you do</text>
  <text start="241.84" dur="3.57">do for the glory of Yahweh do with all</text>
  <text start="244.06" dur="3.959">your heart soul mind straight to do it</text>
  <text start="245.41" dur="5.609">for the poor job way so whether you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.019" dur="6.171">eating or whether you&amp;#39;re cleaning or</text>
  <text start="251.019" dur="5.731">whether you&amp;#39;re at work or at school or</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="5.26">even in the most mundane of tasks</text>
  <text start="256.75" dur="3.03">whatever you&amp;#39;re doing should be done for</text>
  <text start="259.45" dur="3.36">the</text>
  <text start="259.78" dur="5.31">Marie of Yahweh and can be done for the</text>
  <text start="262.81" dur="4.86">glory of Yahweh that&amp;#39;s what devotion is</text>
  <text start="265.09" dur="4.56">you don&amp;#39;t compartmentalize your life in</text>
  <text start="267.67" dur="4.02">other words having a prayer time with</text>
  <text start="269.65" dur="4.26">yah should not be more spiritual than</text>
  <text start="271.69" dur="6.33">brushing your teeth or eating a</text>
  <text start="273.91" dur="5.61">hamburger or taking a jog or loving your</text>
  <text start="278.02" dur="4.11">wife for taking care of your children or</text>
  <text start="279.52" dur="4.92">whatever it might be every act that you</text>
  <text start="282.13" dur="4.11">do should be to the glory of Yahweh and</text>
  <text start="284.44" dur="3.75">if you&amp;#39;re not doing it for Yahweh then</text>
  <text start="286.24" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s something wrong see everything</text>
  <text start="288.19" dur="4.8">that we do it depends on our motive</text>
  <text start="290.41" dur="4.59">things oftentimes actions and things</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="4.17">that we participate in are not evil or</text>
  <text start="295" dur="4.35">good in and of themselves but it depends</text>
  <text start="297.16" dur="5.1">upon the motive why we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="299.35" dur="5.13">something for instance the act of sex</text>
  <text start="302.26" dur="5.159">the act of sex in and of itself is not</text>
  <text start="304.48" dur="5.3">evil but depending on the context that</text>
  <text start="307.419" dur="6.121">it&amp;#39;s done in it could be evil for having</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="4.93">sex with somebody else&amp;#39;s wife or if</text>
  <text start="313.54" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;re committing adultery while you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="314.71" dur="4.08">married then obviously sex is evil at</text>
  <text start="316.78" dur="3.87">that point but if you&amp;#39;re having sex with</text>
  <text start="318.79" dur="4.98">your wife and in the context of marriage</text>
  <text start="320.65" dur="6.63">then it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s godly and honorable so</text>
  <text start="323.77" dur="5.58">every act that we do depends upon why</text>
  <text start="327.28" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re doing it so everything we do</text>
  <text start="329.35" dur="4.86">whether we&amp;#39;re eating or sleeping whether</text>
  <text start="332.29" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re drinking whether we&amp;#39;re cleaning</text>
  <text start="334.21" dur="4.11">whether we&amp;#39;re working or going to school</text>
  <text start="336.07" dur="4.89">whatever we&amp;#39;re doing should be for the</text>
  <text start="338.32" dur="5.4">Lord Yahweh and it&amp;#39;s this whole hearted</text>
  <text start="340.96" dur="4.56">act of consecration and devotion that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.72" dur="4.35">going to be truly needed in these last</text>
  <text start="345.52" dur="4.86">days you know when the scripture says</text>
  <text start="348.07" dur="4.14">that if it were possible even the very</text>
  <text start="350.38" dur="3.99">elect could be deceived I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="3.87">that yaad gave us that scripture and I</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="3.48">believe its repeated in all four of the</text>
  <text start="356.08" dur="3.03">Gospels could be wrong about that but I</text>
  <text start="357.85" dur="2.939">know it&amp;#39;s your pigeon in a couple of</text>
  <text start="359.11" dur="4.23">them I don&amp;#39;t think y&amp;#39;all would give us</text>
  <text start="360.789" dur="5.19">that warning multiple times if it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="363.34" dur="4.47">intend for us to take it seriously and I</text>
  <text start="365.979" dur="3.781">think the best way to combat being</text>
  <text start="367.81" dur="3.66">deceived in these last days is to be</text>
  <text start="369.76" dur="4.05">wholly consecrated and devoted to you</text>
  <text start="371.47" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;re not you&amp;#39;re not dividing if your</text>
  <text start="373.81" dur="3.18">life you&amp;#39;re not compartmentalizing your</text>
  <text start="375.31" dur="3.84">life and saying well I&amp;#39;m going to have</text>
  <text start="376.99" dur="3.57">my spiritual time with with God in the</text>
  <text start="379.15" dur="3.78">morning and then I&amp;#39;m going to go do the</text>
  <text start="380.56" dur="3.87">rest of my stuff or if only I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="382.93" dur="3.03">have to work so much or if only didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="384.43" dur="4.169">have to go to school or do this or do</text>
  <text start="385.96" dur="4.609">that boy I sure could be more spiritual</text>
  <text start="388.599" dur="3.38">well that is a lie</text>
  <text start="390.569" dur="3.69">because whatever you&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="391.979" dur="5.22">whatever situation or circumstance EOS</text>
  <text start="394.259" dur="4.89">put you in you can do it all for the</text>
  <text start="397.199" dur="4.17">glory of Yahweh and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how we</text>
  <text start="399.149" dur="4.32">should be that&amp;#39;s how we modern believers</text>
  <text start="401.369" dur="3.95">should be and that&amp;#39;s how all the great</text>
  <text start="403.469" dur="6.03">men and women throughout history work</text>
  <text start="405.319" dur="5.74">yes you know when Paul says to pray</text>
  <text start="409.499" dur="3.06">without ceasing he doesn&amp;#39;t literally</text>
  <text start="411.059" dur="4.32">mean you&amp;#39;re walking around constantly</text>
  <text start="412.559" dur="4.021">praying although we are to talk to you</text>
  <text start="415.379" dur="2.76">outweigh all throughout our day that</text>
  <text start="416.58" dur="3.72">should be a habit that we should try to</text>
  <text start="418.139" dur="3.51">foster each and every day but what it</text>
  <text start="420.3" dur="3.449">means is that we have an attitude of</text>
  <text start="421.649" dur="4.1">prayer so whatever we&amp;#39;re doing it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="423.749" dur="4.111">attitude of devotion and a prayer and</text>
  <text start="425.749" dur="4.54">that attitude we can take with us</text>
  <text start="427.86" dur="4.559">wherever we go and we should take it</text>
  <text start="430.289" dur="3.78">with us wherever we go how else are we</text>
  <text start="432.419" dur="4.98">going to be a witness to those around us</text>
  <text start="434.069" dur="6.111">unless our very lives are exhibiting the</text>
  <text start="437.399" dur="5.52">qualities of the Messiah of Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="4.18">you know people aren&amp;#39;t stupid if they</text>
  <text start="442.919" dur="3.93">look at our lives they can see if we</text>
  <text start="444.36" dur="4.139">have a switch off button if we say okay</text>
  <text start="446.849" dur="3.33">well this is spiritual time but this is</text>
  <text start="448.499" dur="4.861">non-spiritual time no there&amp;#39;s no such</text>
  <text start="450.179" dur="5.16">thing every act can be holy and should</text>
  <text start="453.36" dur="5.22">be holy as we consecrate it to Yahweh</text>
  <text start="455.339" dur="6.241">and if you&amp;#39;re doing things I&amp;#39;m that that</text>
  <text start="458.58" dur="4.139">are not an act of devotion you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="461.58" dur="3.209">think you&amp;#39;re glorifying god I need you</text>
  <text start="462.719" dur="5.76">to stop it and this could be personal</text>
  <text start="464.789" dur="6.09">you know if eating a chocolate sundae is</text>
  <text start="468.479" dur="5.43">something that you cannot do for the</text>
  <text start="470.879" dur="4.2">glory job and you shouldn&amp;#39;t do it and</text>
  <text start="473.909" dur="2.82">you have to examine your heart and you</text>
  <text start="475.079" dur="3.781">have to ask the the ruach ha kodesh the</text>
  <text start="476.729" dur="3.9">Holy Spirit to search you and to know</text>
  <text start="478.86" dur="3.059">you and to examine yourself so that you</text>
  <text start="480.629" dur="5.19">can see what you need to do in your</text>
  <text start="481.919" dur="5.31">personal life to to glorify Him and</text>
  <text start="485.819" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s something we should all be trying</text>
  <text start="487.229" dur="6.09">to do anyway so I think the most</text>
  <text start="491.039" dur="3.96">important thing to remember is not to so</text>
  <text start="493.319" dur="4.08">much get caught up in all the prophecy</text>
  <text start="494.999" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s being fulfilled even though we do</text>
  <text start="497.399" dur="2.55">need to pay attention to world events</text>
  <text start="498.749" dur="3.21">and I think it is good to read up on</text>
  <text start="499.949" dur="4.411">prophecy but rather than getting caught</text>
  <text start="501.959" dur="3.87">up in all of that and possibly</text>
  <text start="504.36" dur="3.089">distracted by that we need to make sure</text>
  <text start="505.829" dur="3.51">that we&amp;#39;re keeping our eyes on yaad that</text>
  <text start="507.449" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;re keeping our devotion to him that</text>
  <text start="509.339" dur="3.44">we&amp;#39;re talking to him throughout the day</text>
  <text start="510.629" dur="4.801">that we&amp;#39;re continuing to read his word</text>
  <text start="512.779" dur="4.57">continuing to pray to him continuing to</text>
  <text start="515.43" dur="4.589">foster an attitude of prayer and that</text>
  <text start="517.349" dur="5.581">even in the most so-called broadly or</text>
  <text start="520.019" dur="3.441">mundane of tasks that were doing it for</text>
  <text start="522.93" dur="2.75">his glory</text>
  <text start="523.46" dur="4.47">whether whatever it might be this is the</text>
  <text start="525.68" dur="5.13">only way that we should be that our our</text>
  <text start="527.93" dur="4.83">entire will and lives should be yielded</text>
  <text start="530.81" dur="3.99">up to the Messiah to Yahshua the way you</text>
  <text start="532.76" dur="5.49">should be holy and totally and</text>
  <text start="534.8" dur="5.25">completely consecrated to him so I</text>
