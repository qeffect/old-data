  <text start="12.36" dur="5.58">John 7 hi you can see I came here to</text>
  <text start="14.969" dur="5.131">treasure fall but most of the waterfall</text>
  <text start="17.94" dur="4.349">is frozen just to give you some</text>
  <text start="20.1" dur="4.95">perspective where I am at my bed and</text>
  <text start="22.289" dur="5.4">breakfast in Pagosa Springs I&amp;#39;m already</text>
  <text start="25.05" dur="5.52">at an elevation of 7,000 feet so I came</text>
  <text start="27.689" dur="4.53">up here to treasure Falls and I&amp;#39;m about</text>
  <text start="30.57" dur="3.84">a you know eight to nine thousand</text>
  <text start="32.219" dur="4.051">elevation to give you some perspective</text>
  <text start="34.41" dur="2.19">if those of you who live in Portland</text>
  <text start="36.27" dur="2.46">Oregon</text>
  <text start="36.6" dur="4.35">you know the lodge way up at the top of</text>
  <text start="38.73" dur="4.8">Mount Hood that that&amp;#39;s only at 6,000</text>
  <text start="40.95" dur="5.01">feet so I&amp;#39;m actually much higher than</text>
  <text start="43.53" dur="4.349">even the tallest point you can get to in</text>
  <text start="45.96" dur="3.99">in Oregon even though Mount Hood is</text>
  <text start="47.879" dur="3.45">11,000 feet you can only you know the</text>
  <text start="49.95" dur="3.749">the highest you can actually get to in</text>
  <text start="51.329" dur="4.531">terms of living or staying at a lodge</text>
  <text start="53.699" dur="3.84">just 6,000 feet so I&amp;#39;m really high up so</text>
  <text start="55.86" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s why this waterfall is pretty much</text>
  <text start="57.539" dur="4.831">mostly frozen I chose the waterfall as</text>
  <text start="60.12" dur="4.439">my background because today&amp;#39;s the eighth</text>
  <text start="62.37" dur="3.749">day it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the the last great day</text>
  <text start="64.559" dur="3.751">this is the day that Jesus preached</text>
  <text start="66.119" dur="4.531">about the Living Waters gushing out from</text>
  <text start="68.31" dur="4.53">his belly for shouted in the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="3.99">being poured out and also revelation</text>
  <text start="72.84" dur="3.84">20:2 about the crystal waters that gush</text>
  <text start="74.64" dur="3.42">out of the throne of yon the Lamb so</text>

  <text start="349.01" dur="3.24">darkness there&amp;#39;s also many scriptures</text>
  <text start="350.63" dur="3.48">about judging we as Christians are</text>

  <text start="368.09" dur="3.06">think he was a demon for the beginning</text>
  <text start="369.41" dur="3.9">but word of it rebuked them and in fact</text>
  <text start="371.15" dur="4.74">Paul even rebukes Peter publicly to his</text>
  <text start="373.31" dur="4.92">face in front of everyone so again Mark</text>
  <text start="375.89" dur="4.529">Taylor all he has to do is say hey guys</text>

  <text start="386.3" dur="2.43">I shouldn&amp;#39;t have anything to do with</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="3.3">Russ Widener because Russ Wagner very</text>
  <text start="388.73" dur="3.9">boldly declares on his website that he</text>
  <text start="390.41" dur="4.77">considers Jim gall his spiritual father</text>
  <text start="392.63" dur="3.84">and Jim gall embraces the Kundalini</text>

  <text start="410.93" dur="4.38">Satanic doctrine but Mark Taylor has not</text>
  <text start="413.27" dur="3.99">done that in fact if anything he just</text>
  <text start="415.31" dur="4.17">continues to ignore this rebuke to him</text>
  <text start="417.26" dur="4.68">he continues to hide and run like a</text>
  <text start="419.48" dur="3.51">coward and and yaws angry with Mark</text>
  <text start="421.94" dur="3.33">Taylor because Mark Taylor</text>

  <text start="437.09" dur="4.11">a ministry that venerates Jim Gaul who</text>
  <text start="439.43" dur="4.17">loves the Kundalini spirit so this is</text>
  <text start="441.2" dur="5.219">why yaws so angry and anger is not a sin</text>
  <text start="443.6" dur="4.56">guys it can be but remember Jesus he had</text>
  <text start="446.419" dur="3.391">that whip and he went through the temple</text>
  <text start="448.16" dur="3.66">and he overturned that money changers he</text>
  <text start="449.81" dur="4.32">never sinned because righteous anger is</text>

  <text start="1061.139" dur="4.591">who don&amp;#39;t endure this concept is</text>
  <text start="1063.84" dur="4.49">repeated by Paul many times in the book</text>
  <text start="1065.73" dur="5.279">of Hebrews for example in Hebrews 3:6</text>

  <text start="1087.36" dur="4.769">we can&amp;#39;t be saved by works but salvation</text>
  <text start="1090.24" dur="3.629">is more than just saying Jesus please</text>
  <text start="1092.129" dur="3.601">forgive me and then going on our merry</text>
  <text start="1093.869" dur="4.711">way it is a total and complete</text>
  <text start="1095.73" dur="4.559">commitment to Jesus we literally sell</text>
  <text start="1098.58" dur="4.709">ourselves to God just as much as people</text>
  <text start="1100.289" dur="4.89">in Satanism sell themselves to Satan we</text>
  <text start="1103.289" dur="4.171">are then a debtor we are bought and paid</text>
  <text start="1105.179" dur="3.72">for we no longer belong to ourselves we</text>
  <text start="1107.46" dur="3.419">no longer have any rights we are</text>
  <text start="1108.899" dur="4.11">servants the word commitment is neither</text>
  <text start="1110.879" dur="4.561">taught nor practiced today in most</text>
  <text start="1113.009" dur="3.841">American Christian churches most people</text>
  <text start="1115.44" dur="3.449">don&amp;#39;t even know what the word commitment</text>
  <text start="1116.85" dur="4.26">means commitment is not a work</text>
  <text start="1118.889" dur="4.14">commitment is a contract it is a literal</text>
  <text start="1121.11" dur="3.929">selling of yourself to yah</text>
  <text start="1123.029" dur="5.311">Paul says in Romans that he is a debtor</text>
  <text start="1125.039" dur="5.85">Romans 1:14 Messiah bought Paul even as</text>
  <text start="1128.34" dur="4.919">he bought us salvation is a sale it is a</text>
  <text start="1130.889" dur="5.13">transaction commitment is not a work it</text>
  <text start="1133.259" dur="4.351">is actually a sale jesus bought and paid</text>
  <text start="1136.019" dur="3.931">for us otherwise we would belong to</text>
  <text start="1137.61" dur="4.289">Satan and would go to hell the only way</text>
  <text start="1139.95" dur="4.62">out is through a sale what a terrible</text>
  <text start="1141.899" dur="4.561">price Jesus had to pay for us I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1144.57" dur="3.66">think enough people understand this the</text>
  <text start="1146.46" dur="3.839">amount Satan the taxes seems to be</text>
  <text start="1148.23" dur="3.929">directly dependent upon how we abide by</text>
  <text start="1150.299" dur="3">the sale that is the level of our</text>
  <text start="1152.159" dur="4.441">commitment to the Lord</text>
  <text start="1153.299" dur="4.681">job was totally committed only Yaka know</text>
  <text start="1156.6" dur="4.38">the degree to which you have sold out to</text>
  <text start="1157.98" dur="4.919">Jesus but Yod new job start anew job was</text>
  <text start="1160.98" dur="3.21">totally committed to him that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1162.899" dur="3.301">reason y&amp;#39;all was willing to take up</text>
  <text start="1164.19" dur="5.459">Satan&amp;#39;s challenge because y&amp;#39;all knew the</text>
  <text start="1166.2" dur="5.219">job job would stand yah knew that Jesus</text>
  <text start="1169.649" dur="3.301">himself would stand because Jesus was</text>
  <text start="1171.419" dur="3.72">here in human form according to</text>
  <text start="1172.95" dur="2.88">Philippians 2 he was totally committed</text>
  <text start="1175.139" dur="2.551">to the Father</text>
  <text start="1175.83" dur="4.02">therefore yah the father knew that his</text>
  <text start="1177.69" dur="2.43">son Jesus Christ would stand at the</text>
  <text start="1179.85" dur="2.58">point</text>
  <text start="1180.12" dur="4.08">death which he did and not just his own</text>
  <text start="1182.43" dur="4.98">death but he suffered terribly for all</text>
  <text start="1184.2" dur="5.13">the rest of us Satan hates Jesus more</text>
  <text start="1187.41" dur="3.51">than anything else because Jesus now has</text>
  <text start="1189.33" dur="3.99">the legal ownership of the world and</text>
  <text start="1190.92" dur="6.71">shortly will take up that ownership and</text>
  <text start="1193.32" dur="4.31">will dis possess Satan of his kingdom</text>
  <text start="1197.93" dur="4.48">there are two key points Jesus is</text>
  <text start="1200.31" dur="3.78">telling us very clearly that the instant</text>
  <text start="1202.41" dur="3.39">we become identified with him as we will</text>
  <text start="1204.09" dur="3.45">when we become his property his servants</text>
  <text start="1205.8" dur="4.29">then the world which is currently under</text>
  <text start="1207.54" dur="4.31">Satan&amp;#39;s control will hate us in exactly</text>
  <text start="1210.09" dur="3.9">the same manner as it hates Jesus</text>
  <text start="1211.85" dur="4.3">secondly many people say well why should</text>
  <text start="1213.99" dur="3.39">I have to suffer or die after all Jesus</text>
  <text start="1216.15" dur="2.04">won the victory on the cross and</text>
  <text start="1217.38" dur="2.55">suffered for me</text>
  <text start="1218.19" dur="3.87">therefore suffering is not necessary for</text>
  <text start="1219.93" dur="3.78">me but what did Jesus say he said I have</text>
  <text start="1222.06" dur="4.11">said unto you the servant is not greater</text>
  <text start="1223.71" dur="6.63">than his Lord if they have persecuted me</text>
  <text start="1226.17" dur="7.89">they will also persecute you let me see</text>
  <text start="1230.34" dur="5.46">I just wanted to highlight this is why</text>
  <text start="1234.06" dur="4.32">you cannot separate warfare from</text>
  <text start="1235.8" dur="6.27">salvation true salvation is going to put</text>
  <text start="1238.38" dur="5.04">you into direct conflict with Satan and</text>
  <text start="1242.07" dur="8.97">of course she talks about this a lot in</text>
  <text start="1243.42" dur="8.7">her testimony so she continues on just</text>
  <text start="1251.04" dur="2.67">about how important it is to make this</text>
  <text start="1252.12" dur="3.48">commitment so I wanted to read that just</text>
  <text start="1253.71" dur="4.59">because first of all not all divisions</text>
  <text start="1255.6" dur="4.47">bad and you do have to make a total</text>
  <text start="1258.3" dur="2.97">commitment and you will be persecuted of</text>
  <text start="1260.07" dur="2.49">course you&amp;#39;ll have this holy spirit</text>
  <text start="1261.27" dur="3.33">within you that will help you to endure</text>
  <text start="1262.56" dur="3.48">but no one has salvation until you</text>
  <text start="1264.6" dur="3.45">enduring to the end you&amp;#39;re not once</text>
  <text start="1266.04" dur="4.65">saved always saved that&amp;#39;s why Paul kept</text>
  <text start="1268.05" dur="4.32">saying if if you continue if you</text>
  <text start="1270.69" dur="3.57">enduring to the end then you&amp;#39;ll gain</text>
  <text start="1272.37" dur="3.33">salvation we don&amp;#39;t gain our crown of</text>
  <text start="1274.26" dur="3.48">salvation until we stand before the</text>
  <text start="1275.7" dur="4.29">Messiah right now is the testing ground</text>
  <text start="1277.74" dur="3.75">neither myself nor you or assured</text>
  <text start="1279.99" dur="4.14">salvation this once saved always saved</text>
  <text start="1281.49" dur="4.2">is adoption of devils we&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="1284.13" dur="4.02">continue to love him and live with him</text>
  <text start="1285.69" dur="5.19">and also this idea about living in sin</text>
  <text start="1288.15" dur="4.8">first john 3 6 to 11 clearly says that</text>
  <text start="1290.88" dur="4.68">if you&amp;#39;re born of god you will not sin</text>
  <text start="1292.95" dur="5.1">now if you should happen to sin like 1st</text>
  <text start="1295.56" dur="3.69">John 1:8 says you got to repent and have</text>
  <text start="1298.05" dur="2.94">his blood cover you and his blood will</text>
  <text start="1299.25" dur="3.93">wash you from all sin according to 1st</text>
  <text start="1300.99" dur="4.5">John 1:9 but we don&amp;#39;t live a life of sin</text>
  <text start="1303.18" dur="6.33">in fact sin should be a very rare rare</text>
  <text start="1305.49" dur="7.56">rare exception in a true believer true</text>
  <text start="1309.51" dur="4.38">Christians walk so you know when Jesus</text>
  <text start="1313.05" dur="2.79">lives within you</text>
  <text start="1313.89" dur="3.659">his Holy Spirit always provides your way</text>
  <text start="1315.84" dur="4.14">out and he teaches you to obey his words</text>
  <text start="1317.549" dur="4.621">so I do not sin I do not live in sin and</text>
  <text start="1319.98" dur="3.06">neither should you if you love him now</text>
  <text start="1322.17" dur="3.24">Mark Taylor</text>
  <text start="1323.04" dur="4.05">he lives in sin he continues in sin</text>

  <text start="1337.799" dur="3.991">and that&amp;#39;s why he needs to repent and</text>
  <text start="1339.63" dur="3.48">the same thing for me if I were to be</text>
  <text start="1341.79" dur="3.57">associated with someone like that I</text>
