  <text start="3.33" dur="6.54">restoration ministries this is day six</text>
  <text start="5.46" dur="5.759">of the feast of unleavened bread and i</text>
  <text start="9.87" dur="3.87">hope that you all have been enjoying</text>
  <text start="11.219" dur="6.871">your passover week and passover</text>
  <text start="13.74" dur="7.22">celebrations today I want to just talk</text>
  <text start="18.09" dur="6.72">briefly about a passage of scripture</text>
  <text start="20.96" dur="5.92">that refers to the Passover that I think</text>
  <text start="24.81" dur="6.27">is very important and that passages in</text>
  <text start="26.88" dur="6.6">Joshua chapter 5 and in Joshua read that</text>
  <text start="31.08" dur="5.76">the children of Israel the second</text>
  <text start="33.48" dur="6.149">generation that came out of Egypt they</text>
  <text start="36.84" dur="4.83">had all grown up and they were ready now</text>
  <text start="39.629" dur="5.881">to go into the Promised Land they were</text>
  <text start="41.67" dur="6.75">they had just crossed the Jordan River</text>
  <text start="45.51" dur="6">four days before on the tenth of the</text>
  <text start="48.42" dur="6.18">vivan lamb day and they were ready now</text>
  <text start="51.51" dur="6.389">to go and take the promised land as</text>
  <text start="54.6" dur="4.41">Yahweh had promised them but we read</text>
  <text start="57.899" dur="3.241">something very interesting in that</text>
  <text start="59.01" dur="4.74">passage and that is that Yahweh before</text>
  <text start="61.14" dur="4.68">they they begin their conquest Yahweh</text>
  <text start="63.75" dur="4.71">ask Joshua to have all the males</text>
  <text start="65.82" dur="4.86">circumcised because of the rebellious</text>
  <text start="68.46" dur="3.96">parents who wound up perishing in the</text>
  <text start="70.68" dur="3.63">wilderness for their hardness of heart</text>
  <text start="72.42" dur="5.4">they did not circumcise their children</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="5.91">like Torah had told them to so Joshua</text>
  <text start="77.82" dur="4.409">had all the men circumsized during that</text>
  <text start="80.22" dur="4.469">four day period between the time that</text>
  <text start="82.229" dur="3.78">they crossed over the river and the</text>
  <text start="84.689" dur="5.341">fourteenth of a bee which would have</text>
  <text start="86.009" dur="6.72">been Passover and Yahweh then tells them</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="5.33">that the this day the the reproach of</text>
  <text start="92.729" dur="4.951">Egypt has been rolled away from them and</text>
  <text start="95.36" dur="5.71">of course we know that the circumcision</text>
  <text start="97.68" dur="5.25">of the foreskin is symbolic imagery of</text>
  <text start="101.07" dur="4.979">the circumcision the inward circumcision</text>
  <text start="102.93" dur="5.82">of the heart now more importantly or</text>
  <text start="106.049" dur="4.231">maybe just as importantly the</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="3.63">circumcision of the foreskin has to</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="4.68">happen in order for a male to be able to</text>
  <text start="112.38" dur="4.89">partake in Passover to be able to eat</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="5.79">the Passover lamb lamb as commanded in</text>
  <text start="117.27" dur="5.76">Exodus chapter 12 so on the fourteenth</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="5.1">day Aviva&amp;#39;s there in camped just on the</text>
  <text start="123.03" dur="4.619">other side of the Jordan on the western</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="3.42">shores of the Jordan River as they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="2.47">getting ready to go into the Promised</text>
  <text start="129.27" dur="4.06">Land</text>
  <text start="130.119" dur="4.381">they celebrate Passover for the first</text>
  <text start="133.33" dur="5.129">time as they&amp;#39;re about to enter the</text>
  <text start="134.5" dur="7.62">promised land and on that day the mana</text>
  <text start="138.459" dur="6.81">ends and they&amp;#39;re able to eat the the</text>
  <text start="142.12" dur="4.92">parched corn of the land and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="145.269" dur="4.411">need the manna that fell in the</text>
  <text start="147.04" dur="4.8">wilderness anymore and they go ahead and</text>
  <text start="149.68" dur="4.229">they celebrate Passover so they eat the</text>
  <text start="151.84" dur="5.94">lamb and the bitter herbs and the</text>
  <text start="153.909" dur="9.061">unleavened bread and then what we read</text>
  <text start="157.78" dur="7.14">about is in the following passages that</text>
  <text start="162.97" dur="4.32">the children of Israel are instructed by</text>
  <text start="164.92" dur="5.64">the angel of Yahweh to march around</text>
  <text start="167.29" dur="5.16">Jericho seven times for a period of</text>
  <text start="170.56" dur="3.739">seven days and although it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="5.039">explicitly stated i think it is</text>
  <text start="174.299" dur="6.22">implicitly stated that those seven days</text>
  <text start="177.489" dur="6.78">must correspond to the seven days of</text>
  <text start="180.519" dur="5.31">unleavened bread and it is on the</text>
  <text start="184.269" dur="4.261">seventh day of unleavened bread which of</text>
  <text start="185.829" dur="4.08">course according to the Torah is a high</text>
  <text start="188.53" dur="2.879">Sabbath just like the first day of</text>
  <text start="189.909" dur="2.821">unleavened bread but it&amp;#39;s on that</text>
  <text start="191.409" dur="3.631">seventh day of unleavened bread that the</text>
  <text start="192.73" dur="3.93">walls come tumbling down and that the</text>
  <text start="195.04" dur="5.55">children of Israel attain their first</text>
  <text start="196.66" dur="9.12">victory and destroy the people of</text>
  <text start="200.59" dur="7.41">Jericho and when overcome that city so I</text>
  <text start="205.78" dur="3.329">often like to think that because the</text>
  <text start="208" dur="3.15">seven days of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="209.109" dur="3.391">correspondent with the seven days that</text>
  <text start="211.15" dur="4.679">the children of Israel marched around</text>
  <text start="212.5" dur="4.68">the city of Jericho and that it was upon</text>
  <text start="215.829" dur="3.24">the seventh day of unleavened bread that</text>
  <text start="217.18" dur="4.41">the walls of Jericho came tumbling down</text>
  <text start="219.069" dur="6.151">as the people of Yahweh shouted to their</text>
  <text start="221.59" dur="6.72">yacht that this is a time spiritually</text>
  <text start="225.22" dur="5.46">when we should really ask your way to</text>
  <text start="228.31" dur="5.85">bring down tear down any walls in our</text>
  <text start="230.68" dur="5.04">lives maybe there have been issues or</text>
  <text start="234.16" dur="3.539">problems in our lives that we&amp;#39;re dealing</text>
  <text start="235.72" dur="5.25">with maybe they&amp;#39;re spiritual in nature</text>
  <text start="237.699" dur="5.25">and we haven&amp;#39;t been able to resolve them</text>
  <text start="240.97" dur="4.349">and so I think this is a time</text>
  <text start="242.949" dur="4.951">spiritually when we can cry out to yonce</text>
  <text start="245.319" dur="7.53">yah even as you brought the walls of</text>
  <text start="247.9" dur="6.33">Jericho down in the time of that feast</text>
  <text start="252.849" dur="3.661">of unleavened bread the days of</text>
  <text start="254.23" dur="5.34">unleavened bread of Joshua&amp;#39;s time so to</text>
  <text start="256.51" dur="5.19">bring these walls down in my life for</text>
  <text start="259.57" dur="3.839">this particular situation and I think</text>
  <text start="261.7" dur="2.23">that&amp;#39;s a good prayer to pray during this</text>
  <text start="263.409" dur="2.26">season</text>
  <text start="263.93" dur="3.959">because there are seasons there are</text>
  <text start="265.669" dur="3.661">times there are appointments that you</text>
  <text start="267.889" dur="3.571">always have set out for us to meet with</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="3.78">them and I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anything</text>
  <text start="271.46" dur="3.42">mystical about this I&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="273.11" dur="5.52">y&amp;#39;all can&amp;#39;t tear down things in your</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="5.31">life at other times of the year but I</text>
  <text start="278.63" dur="3.659">think this particular time of the year</text>
  <text start="280.19" dur="3.93">is a special time especially as we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="282.289" dur="3.571">the new year I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s early</text>
  <text start="284.12" dur="6">spring okay here in the northern</text>
  <text start="285.86" dur="7.14">hemisphere so everything&amp;#39;s new fresh you</text>
  <text start="290.12" dur="6.269">know the the trees are turning green the</text>
  <text start="293" dur="4.919">flowers are blossoming and everything is</text>
  <text start="296.389" dur="3.96">just beautiful and so it&amp;#39;s a wonderful</text>
  <text start="297.919" dur="4.761">time of year to sort of not only do that</text>
  <text start="300.349" dur="4.741">clean the spring cleaning that we did</text>
  <text start="302.68" dur="4.03">six days ago where we cleaned all the</text>
  <text start="305.09" dur="4.02">lovin out of our homes and our cars and</text>
  <text start="306.71" dur="4.41">got rid of all of 11 yeast products but</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="5.16">also to do a spiritual cleaning of our</text>
  <text start="311.12" dur="4.95">home lives and and to ask you to take to</text>
  <text start="314.27" dur="4.079">tear down these walls because he will do</text>
  <text start="316.07" dur="3.779">it and so if you have any type of</text>
  <text start="318.349" dur="5.341">situation of getting a life i encourage</text>
  <text start="319.849" dur="6.511">you offer up that prayer tonight april</text>
  <text start="323.69" dur="5.07">the eleventh wednesday night begins the</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="5.1">seventh and last day of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="328.76" dur="4.17">and of course it is a high Sabbath it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.46" dur="4.139">a Shabbat it&amp;#39;s a day that you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="332.93" dur="6.54">supposed to to work or buy or sell or</text>
  <text start="335.599" dur="5.07">anything like that so tonight april</text>
  <text start="339.47" dur="4.11">eleventh until tomorrow night April</text>
  <text start="340.669" dur="4.861">twelfth also all day Thursday is the</text>
  <text start="343.58" dur="3.559">high Sabbath the seventh day of</text>
  <text start="345.53" dur="4.74">unleavened bread so I encourage you</text>
  <text start="347.139" dur="5.171">offer up that prayer to nym over the</text>
  <text start="350.27" dur="4.47">next 24 hours ask him to bring down</text>
  <text start="352.31" dur="5.13">these walls in your life of any type of</text>
  <text start="354.74" dur="4.919">situation that you&amp;#39;re dealing with and I</text>
  <text start="357.44" dur="4.44">think you&amp;#39;ll be very pleasantly</text>
  <text start="359.659" dur="5.19">surprised and encouraged by the results</text>
  <text start="361.88" dur="7.379">of such a prayer because this is the</text>
  <text start="364.849" dur="7.31">time to to ask how to help you to do</text>
  <text start="369.259" dur="4.711">that and read that passage in in Joshua</text>
  <text start="372.159" dur="3.491">because I think you&amp;#39;ll agree with me</text>
  <text start="373.97" dur="3.289">that it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that those seven</text>
  <text start="375.65" dur="3.449">days that they march around Jericho</text>
  <text start="377.259" dur="5.201">correspond to the seven days of</text>
  <text start="379.099" dur="6.781">unleavened bread so just another way</text>
  <text start="382.46" dur="5.22">that this feast day is relevant to our</text>
  <text start="385.88" dur="4.62">lives relevant to our lives physically</text>
  <text start="387.68" dur="4.709">relevant to our lives spiritually don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="390.5" dur="3.599">let anyone tell you that these are just</text>
  <text start="392.389" dur="3.261">old Jewish traditions that have passed</text>
  <text start="394.099" dur="4.011">away with the Old Testament because</text>
  <text start="395.65" dur="5.07">not as Paul the Apostle said these are</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="6.39">shadows of things to come and not only</text>
  <text start="400.72" dur="7.86">that but these are feasts that help us</text>
  <text start="404.5" dur="7.32">to even currently point toward point</text>
  <text start="408.58" dur="5.309">toward our lives now and how we can pray</text>
  <text start="411.82" dur="3.99">and how we can relate to Yahweh so I</text>
  <text start="413.889" dur="4.861">have a wonderful rest of your feast of</text>
  <text start="415.81" dur="5.46">unleavened bread remember that tomorrow</text>
  <text start="418.75" dur="4.56">night April the 12th when it is</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="5.82">completely dark outside you can once</text>
  <text start="423.31" dur="6.87">again eat bread eat yeast bring 11</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="6.51">products into your home and and you can</text>
  <text start="430.18" dur="5.85">do that once again so Shalom Yahweh</text>
  <text start="433.6" dur="4.2">bless and I&amp;#39;ll have a final podcast for</text>
  <text start="436.03" dur="3.68">the high Sabbath the seventh day of</text>
  <text start="437.8" dur="4.91">unleavened bread will be coming up</text>
