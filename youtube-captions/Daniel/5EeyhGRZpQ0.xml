  <text start="0" dur="6">list the oldest part of clonal Em&amp;#39;s burg</text>
  <text start="3.27" dur="6.21">this is the cellar that is beneath the</text>
  <text start="6" dur="5.13">governor&amp;#39;s palace and this cellar is</text>
  <text start="9.48" dur="4.619">actually made of brick that George</text>
  <text start="11.13" dur="5.399">Washington Thomas Jefferson touched and</text>
  <text start="14.099" dur="3.631">walked on it&amp;#39;s about the only particle</text>
  <text start="16.529" dur="3.541">in Ellensburg that&amp;#39;s still preserved</text>
  <text start="17.73" dur="4.68">from the actual 18th century so this was</text>
  <text start="20.07" dur="3.93">not rebuilt by Rockefeller or anything</text>
  <text start="22.41" dur="5.76">like that this this was here they</text>
  <text start="24" dur="11.94">discovered this and that this is an</text>
  <text start="28.17" dur="9.51">actual cellar from from 1776 so again</text>
  <text start="35.94" dur="4.56">this brick that I&amp;#39;m walking on these</text>
  <text start="37.68" dur="11.82">stones that I&amp;#39;m walking on this was</text>
  <text start="40.5" dur="12.649">actually it&amp;#39;s sort of dimly lit that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="49.5" dur="6.66">hard it&amp;#39;s hard to show that they have</text>
  <text start="53.149" dur="4.991">they have like sort of the the wine cast</text>
  <text start="56.16" dur="7.19">which of course that&amp;#39;s replicas because</text>
  <text start="58.14" dur="7.32">all the original wine was taken out but</text>
  <text start="63.35" dur="4.72">what is interesting that I want to talk</text>
  <text start="65.46" dur="4.56">about that I have two subscribers with</text>
  <text start="68.07" dur="4.26">me today Pam and Tanya and we watched</text>
  <text start="70.02" dur="3.54">the movie the introductory movie at the</text>
  <text start="72.33" dur="3.84">visitor center before we started our</text>
  <text start="73.56" dur="4.32">tour today at Kelowna and lenzburg and</text>
  <text start="76.17" dur="5.489">what&amp;#39;s interesting is that Thomas</text>
  <text start="77.88" dur="5.76">Jefferson proposed that on June 1st they</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="5.701">would do prayer and fasting as they were</text>
  <text start="83.64" dur="7.26">getting ready to launch this what would</text>
  <text start="87.36" dur="4.68">become the Revolutionary War and and</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="3.09">June 1st I think that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="92.04" dur="3.93">because you know Pentecost Shavuot is</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="3.3">always anywhere from late May to late</text>
  <text start="95.97" dur="3.57">June depending on the year</text>
  <text start="97.29" dur="4.5">so June 1st is sort of the season of</text>
  <text start="99.54" dur="3.509">Pentecost which is of course the 50 days</text>
  <text start="101.79" dur="3.45">after the feast of firstfruits at the</text>
  <text start="103.049" dur="3.841">Jubilee it&amp;#39;s when both the Torah was</text>
  <text start="105.24" dur="3.809">given on Mount Sinai and when the Holy</text>
  <text start="106.89" dur="4.32">Spirit was poured out thousands of years</text>
  <text start="109.049" dur="4.32">later on the early Jewish disciples and</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="3.99">so it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a Jubilee celebration and</text>
  <text start="113.369" dur="4.561">that&amp;#39;s the day Thomas Jefferson declared</text>
  <text start="115.2" dur="5.79">is a day of fasting and prayer when they</text>
  <text start="117.93" dur="5.61">launched there and they tried they tried</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="4.409">to not bring it to whirling they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="123.54" dur="4.109">really tried they did all they could</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="5.92">I which the movie really shows they did</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="7.65">all they could to avoid war but</text>
  <text start="131.319" dur="6.48">written King George the third they were</text>
  <text start="135.299" dur="6.371">they weren&amp;#39;t really interested in in</text>
  <text start="137.799" dur="9.14">peace they had war lads and they wanted</text>
  <text start="141.67" dur="7.439">to oppress the American people and and</text>
  <text start="146.939" dur="7.931">so through that prayer and fasting on</text>
  <text start="149.109" dur="9.5">June first forget what year it was it</text>
  <text start="154.87" dur="3.739">was the year of when the actual</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="4.33">Revolutionary War began but in any case</text>
  <text start="161.499" dur="6.151">I thought that was really amazing</text>
  <text start="163.48" dur="5.939">fascinating ok I&amp;#39;m sorry how dimly lit</text>
  <text start="167.65" dur="8.28">it is I&amp;#39;ll go let&amp;#39;s see able to go</text>
