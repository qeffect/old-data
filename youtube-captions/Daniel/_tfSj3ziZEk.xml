  <text start="43.559" dur="3.871">Oregon at least that&amp;#39;s what it looks</text>
  <text start="44.61" dur="4.769">like in any case i first loved the</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="4.23">scripture that&amp;#39;s there and thought it</text>

  <text start="57.739" dur="5.471">this week it seems like at least if</text>
  <text start="60.84" dur="4.59">you&amp;#39;ve been looking at the news seems</text>
  <text start="63.21" dur="5.729">like our culture our country</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="7.17">everything&amp;#39;s just kind of unraveling and</text>
  <text start="68.939" dur="4.891">it&amp;#39;s i guess that&amp;#39;s not to be something</text>
  <text start="72.6" dur="5.07">that we should be surprised about</text>
  <text start="73.83" dur="5.7">because I mean we&amp;#39;ve been sewing and</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="3.87">sewing and sewing and sewing and sewing</text>
  <text start="79.53" dur="6.18">wickedness in this nation for so long</text>
  <text start="81.54" dur="6.329">that now we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re reaping it and and</text>
  <text start="85.71" dur="4.049">this nation is I mean you can just see</text>
  <text start="87.869" dur="3.301">all the don&amp;#39;t want to dwell on it</text>
  <text start="89.759" dur="3.391">because obviously it&amp;#39;s Shabbat but you</text>
  <text start="91.17" dur="6.42">can see how things are just all sort of</text>
  <text start="93.15" dur="6.27">coming apart and unraveling and you know</text>
  <text start="97.59" dur="4.83">even when Jerry and I were preaching the</text>
  <text start="99.42" dur="5.309">/ Shabbat at Pioneer Square we had quite</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="3.9">a bit of opposition against us at least</text>
  <text start="104.729" dur="5.07">during the portion when when I was</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="8.25">preaching toward the end and but you</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="8.491">know after that Jerry and I went up to</text>
  <text start="114.57" dur="5.61">the gorge and we just kind of SAT and we</text>
  <text start="118.29" dur="4.619">were looking out at the mountains and</text>
  <text start="120.18" dur="4.14">just fellowship being and talking and we</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="4.291">could see I guess there was some</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="5.35">remnants of fireworks from the fourth of</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="6.259">July holiday but but we could see these</text>
  <text start="129.67" dur="7.09">looks like bright sort of little specks</text>
  <text start="133.459" dur="5.791">of light way way in the distance deep</text>
  <text start="136.76" dur="4.35">into the gorge and as I was looking at</text>
  <text start="139.25" dur="4.319">that I thought wow look at that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.11" dur="5.67">almost like we&amp;#39;re being separated or</text>
  <text start="143.569" dur="5.551">were far far away from all the chaos or</text>
  <text start="146.78" dur="5.37">whatever&amp;#39;s going on just kind of a</text>
  <text start="149.12" dur="6.39">prophetic picture you know yah will</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="5.22">protect his people he promises in Psalm</text>
  <text start="155.51" dur="5.369">91 that he&amp;#39;ll put us under the shadow of</text>
  <text start="157.37" dur="5.25">his wings as long as we&amp;#39;re loving him as</text>
  <text start="160.879" dur="2.791">long as we&amp;#39;re not denying his name as</text>
  <text start="162.62" dur="3.239">long as we&amp;#39;re walking in his</text>
  <text start="163.67" dur="5.849">Commandments and and keeping covenant</text>
  <text start="165.859" dur="5.341">with him I think he&amp;#39;s preparing us too I</text>
  <text start="169.519" dur="5.041">know a lot of us are going through</text>
  <text start="171.2" dur="5.789">different tests my own pastor he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="174.56" dur="4.47">gone through just a whole lot of tests</text>
  <text start="176.989" dur="4.59">lately I mean he lost his two dogs last</text>
  <text start="179.03" dur="4.379">week and then he got into a really bad</text>
  <text start="181.579" dur="4.08">car accident league before and then he</text>
  <text start="183.409" dur="3.541">had other problems and I mean I think</text>
  <text start="185.659" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re all just kind of going through</text>
  <text start="186.95" dur="6.629">struggles and tests and things that God</text>
  <text start="190.129" dur="6.901">is using to prepare us for the times</text>
  <text start="193.579" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re coming ahead right now things</text>
  <text start="197.03" dur="6.09">are relatively peaceful right now you</text>

  <text start="203.12" dur="5.399">things happening I mean right now we can</text>
  <text start="205.909" dur="4.321">still go about our daily lives if we</text>

  <text start="210.23" dur="2.909">are peaceful how do you think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="211.25" dur="3.449">going to draw close to what everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="213.139" dur="4.201">coming apart we&amp;#39;re not because will be</text>
  <text start="214.699" dur="4.831">filled with terror and you know</text>
  <text start="217.34" dur="3.81">scrambling around so that&amp;#39;s why y&amp;#39;all</text>

  <text start="239.349" dur="5.591">negative things going on in the news it</text>
