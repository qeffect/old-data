  <text start="170.07" dur="5.7">our prayer meetings because it may be</text>
  <text start="174.45" dur="3.99">that some people have a wrong impression</text>
  <text start="175.77" dur="4.65">of what our prayer meetings are alike</text>
  <text start="178.44" dur="3.84">and then they join in they&amp;#39;re like this</text>
  <text start="180.42" dur="4.86">isn&amp;#39;t exactly what I bargained for so</text>
  <text start="182.28" dur="6.69">I&amp;#39;d like to explain what we do in our</text>
  <text start="185.28" dur="5.01">prayer meetings because it&amp;#39;s like I get</text>
  <text start="188.97" dur="3.69">a lot of emails saying oh I want to join</text>
  <text start="190.29" dur="3.78">your friend meeting and I put you on an</text>
  <text start="192.66" dur="4.05">email list and then you never show up so</text>
  <text start="194.07" dur="5.22">so let me just explain so John and I</text>

  <text start="205.26" dur="6.45">mine who lives out in New Jersey and he</text>
  <text start="207.68" dur="6.91">and I for many nights it was just him he</text>
  <text start="211.71" dur="4.08">and I in the prayer room we started</text>
  <text start="214.59" dur="3.42">doing these prayer meetings back in</text>
  <text start="215.79" dur="4.59">October and we&amp;#39;ve been meeting every</text>
  <text start="218.01" dur="4.35">single night every single night just</text>
  <text start="220.38" dur="4.41">like in the book of Acts but John and I</text>
  <text start="222.36" dur="5.4">we love to do praise and worship so for</text>
  <text start="224.79" dur="5.88">the first hour all we do is sing praises</text>
  <text start="227.76" dur="5.13">we do praise and worship sometimes we go</text>
  <text start="230.67" dur="4.53">longer than an hour but that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="232.89" dur="4.77">important to John and myself we love to</text>
  <text start="235.2" dur="3.99">sing praises to him we love and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="2.97">its biblical you&amp;#39;re supposed to before</text>
  <text start="239.19" dur="3.57">you ask anything of him you&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="240.63" dur="4.41">to always come to him with Thanksgiving</text>
  <text start="242.76" dur="4.47">so we praise and worship so if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="245.04" dur="4.74">like praise and worship you&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="4.26">like this prayer group so we spend about</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="4.38">an hour sometimes longer and praising</text>
  <text start="251.49" dur="5.219">worship then after that after that</text>
  <text start="254.16" dur="4.71">prison worship I then open it up and say</text>
  <text start="256.709" dur="4.53">if anybody has a word or a prophecy or a</text>
  <text start="258.87" dur="4.53">song or scripture please share and</text>
  <text start="261.239" dur="3.601">various people will start sharing this</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="3.45">is just like how they did things in the</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="6.06">first century they met house-to-house</text>
  <text start="266.85" dur="5.73">daily then after that we move into</text>
  <text start="270.9" dur="5.46">intercession now we have a list now I</text>
  <text start="272.58" dur="7.61">think it&amp;#39;s like over 280 so we only take</text>
  <text start="276.36" dur="8.55">30 a night we just do 30 30 30 30 30 and</text>
  <text start="280.19" dur="7.09">I have John pray over like 15 20 and</text>
  <text start="284.91" dur="4.55">then either I&amp;#39;ll pray over another 15 or</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="6.109">20 or I&amp;#39;ll ask somebody in the group</text>
  <text start="289.46" dur="6.03">likes you that that has the list then I</text>

  <text start="306.08" dur="3.809">we pray for the nation and then at that</text>
  <text start="308.24" dur="3.329">point once we&amp;#39;re done with praying for</text>
  <text start="309.889" dur="4.051">the requests that have come in I then</text>
  <text start="311.569" dur="5.91">ask if anybody has prayer requests in</text>
  <text start="313.94" dur="4.62">the room and usually there&amp;#39;s sometimes</text>
  <text start="317.479" dur="2.22">there&amp;#39;s one or two people that have</text>
  <text start="318.56" dur="3.919">requests no there&amp;#39;s a lot of people</text>

  <text start="332.389" dur="3.451">for whoever&amp;#39;s asking so someone might</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="2.669">say oh I know how to prepare me for this</text>
  <text start="335.84" dur="2.94">so then I&amp;#39;ll pick somebody else in the</text>
  <text start="337.039" dur="5.22">program to pray for them so everyone</text>
  <text start="338.78" dur="5.16">gets a chance to pray and then and then</text>
  <text start="342.259" dur="4.201">they meet again so sometimes it lasts</text>
  <text start="343.94" dur="4.4">about two hours or so I don&amp;#39;t require</text>
  <text start="346.46" dur="4.65">people to stay for the whole two hours</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="5.859">but I do require people to have their</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="4.77">video on all the time and their audio on</text>

  <text start="360.08" dur="3.66">come to the prayer meeting before</text>
  <text start="361.509" dur="5.891">because somehow they can&amp;#39;t figure out</text>
  <text start="363.74" dur="7.2">how to turn on the camera and I won&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="367.4" dur="5.43">will tolerate that John you know 78</text>
  <text start="370.94" dur="4.8">years old he has no problem turning on</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="5.519">his camera in his audio so I don&amp;#39;t buy</text>
  <text start="375.74" dur="3.87">that anyone can&amp;#39;t figure it out so</text>
  <text start="378.349" dur="3.331">that&amp;#39;s all I require but you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
