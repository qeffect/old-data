  <text start="0.38" dur="6.49">Shalom this is now the second video that</text>
  <text start="3.659" dur="6.331">will provide proof that Yahshua this is</text>
  <text start="6.87" dur="6.21">irrefutable proof that Yahshua Jesus the</text>
  <text start="9.99" dur="4.37">Messiah rose from the dead rose from the</text>
  <text start="13.08" dur="3.93">grave</text>
  <text start="14.36" dur="5.47">this next proof is the resurrection</text>
  <text start="17.01" dur="6.12">appearances so what I mean by that is</text>
  <text start="19.83" dur="5.01">there is considerable evidence that</text>
  <text start="23.13" dur="2.819">Yahshua&amp;#39;s disciples have real</text>
  <text start="24.84" dur="4.109">experiences</text>
  <text start="25.949" dur="5.941">with the one whom they believed was the</text>
  <text start="28.949" dur="5.431">Risen Messiah now this this is not</text>
  <text start="31.89" dur="5.25">commonly disputed today because we have</text>
  <text start="34.38" dur="5.1">the testimony of the original disciples</text>
  <text start="37.14" dur="4.89">themselves that they saw Yahshua alive</text>
  <text start="39.48" dur="4.079">again and again you do not need to</text>
  <text start="42.03" dur="4.77">believe in the reliability of the</text>
  <text start="43.559" dur="6.121">Gospels to believe that in fact if you</text>
  <text start="46.8" dur="5.61">go to first Corinthians chapter 15</text>
  <text start="49.68" dur="6.059">verses 3 through 8</text>
  <text start="52.41" dur="6.09">the Apostle Paul shall he records this</text>
  <text start="55.739" dur="7.741">ancient Creed concerning Yahshua&amp;#39;s death</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="6.839">burial and resurrection and it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="63.48" dur="4.59">earlier than the letter in which Paul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="65.339" dur="4.501">recording it so he wrote this Creed to</text>
  <text start="68.07" dur="3.869">the Corinthians but he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="69.84" dur="4.38">something that happened much earlier</text>
  <text start="71.939" dur="3.18">than the time he actually you sent that</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="2.7">letter the Corinthians</text>
  <text start="75.119" dur="4.261">let me explain that I&amp;#39;ll just I&amp;#39;ll read</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="4.53">those verses so it makes more sense for</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="4.62">I delivered to you as of first</text>
  <text start="81.45" dur="4.5">importance what I also received that</text>
  <text start="84" dur="3.57">Messiah died for our sins according to</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="3.51">the scriptures and that he was buried</text>
  <text start="87.57" dur="3.54">and that he was raised on the third day</text>
  <text start="89.46" dur="4.799">according to the scriptures and that he</text>
  <text start="91.11" dur="5.31">appeared to Cephas or Peter then to the</text>
  <text start="94.259" dur="5.881">twelve after that he appeared to more</text>
  <text start="96.42" dur="5.61">than 500 brethren at one time okay so</text>
  <text start="100.14" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s generally agreed by critical</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="4.56">scholars that Paul received this Creed</text>
  <text start="104.67" dur="4.8">this understanding that I just read</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="4.29">there from Peter and from James and this</text>
  <text start="109.47" dur="4.71">happened between about three to five</text>
  <text start="110.88" dur="4.89">years after the crucifixion now Peter</text>
  <text start="114.18" dur="3.45">and James are listed in this Creed as</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="6.36">having seen the Risen Messiah in fact</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="7.379">all of the ten eleven disciples are</text>
  <text start="122.13" dur="5.04">listed here is seeing the Messiah since</text>
  <text start="125.009" dur="4.741">they&amp;#39;re the ones who gave this Creed to</text>
  <text start="127.17" dur="5.55">Paul this is therefore a statement of</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="3.99">their their own testimony now there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="4.95">Jewish scholar</text>
  <text start="133.74" dur="7.92">name is pin Casa la peed first name is</text>
  <text start="137.67" dur="8.76">spelled pinc H aah s and his last name</text>
  <text start="141.66" dur="8.36">is la pide he said this Creed may be</text>
  <text start="146.43" dur="6.27">considered the statement of eyewitnesses</text>
  <text start="150.02" dur="5.23">so we definitely have more than enough</text>
  <text start="152.7" dur="6.57">proof that that these disciples actually</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="6.3">saw a being that they sincerely believed</text>
  <text start="159.27" dur="6.45">was the Risen Messiah was Yahshua come</text>
  <text start="161.55" dur="5.67">back from the dead okay so I understand</text>
  <text start="165.72" dur="4.02">of course that just because the</text>
  <text start="167.22" dur="4.23">disciples thought that they saw Yahshua</text>
  <text start="169.74" dur="5.37">doesn&amp;#39;t automatically mean that they</text>
  <text start="171.45" dur="4.98">really did but really we only have three</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="3.51">possible alternatives since they</text>
  <text start="176.43" dur="4.2">certainly think they saw him there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="178.62" dur="3.98">only three alternatives either they were</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="5.25">lying they were lying to everyone about</text>
  <text start="182.6" dur="5.94">actually seeing Yahshua or they</text>
  <text start="185.88" dur="7.14">hallucinate it they were just crazy or</text>
  <text start="188.54" dur="6.88">they really saw Yahshua after he had</text>
  <text start="193.02" dur="5.85">risen from the dead it can only be one</text>
  <text start="195.42" dur="5.73">of those three possibilities so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="4.07">look at those three possibilities and</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="4.2">try to figure out which ones most likely</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="4.57">first of all they were lying they were</text>
  <text start="205.35" dur="3.56">just lying about the whole thing okay</text>
  <text start="207.51" dur="6.87">well I sort of touched on this on my</text>
  <text start="208.91" dur="8.5">first video but the disciples knew that</text>
  <text start="214.38" dur="5.16">Yahshua if the disciples knew that that</text>
  <text start="217.41" dur="3.45">he had not really risen in other words</text>
  <text start="219.54" dur="3.12">they were lying about the whole thing</text>
  <text start="220.86" dur="5.34">and they just made up the whole story</text>
  <text start="222.66" dur="6.6">about the resurrection why did 10 of the</text>
  <text start="226.2" dur="4.92">disciples willingly die as martyrs for</text>
  <text start="229.26" dur="4.5">their belief in the resurrection I mean</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="4.14">that makes absolutely no sense now we</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="3.84">know through history that people will</text>
  <text start="235.26" dur="4.08">they will die for a lie that they think</text>
  <text start="237.6" dur="3.06">is true in other words maybe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="4.53">deceived about something and they&amp;#39;ll die</text>
  <text start="240.66" dur="5.55">for that but the fact is and in this</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="4.38">particular situation if Yahshua really</text>
  <text start="246.21" dur="3.69">did not rise the disciples would have</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="2.79">known they would have known it because</text>
  <text start="249.9" dur="1.5">they would have been lying about the</text>
  <text start="251.04" dur="2.64">whole thing</text>
  <text start="251.4" dur="4.5">thus they wouldn&amp;#39;t have just been dying</text>
  <text start="253.68" dur="4.71">for a lie that they mistakenly believe</text>
  <text start="255.9" dur="5.52">was true they would have been dying for</text>
  <text start="258.39" dur="5.94">a lie that they knew was a lie and I</text>
  <text start="261.42" dur="5.52">mean to think that 10 people would have</text>
  <text start="264.33" dur="3.48">gone through torture and beatings and</text>
  <text start="266.94" dur="3.09">all the things that they</text>
  <text start="267.81" dur="4.02">through eventually even giving your own</text>
  <text start="270.03" dur="4.71">lives for something that they knew to be</text>
  <text start="271.83" dur="5.04">a lie that makes absolutely no sense</text>
  <text start="274.74" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s totally contrary to human nature</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="6.57">and again I challenge anyone show me one</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="4.65">single instance of a human who knew</text>
  <text start="283.44" dur="3.54">something was a lie and was willing to</text>
  <text start="286.2" dur="5.01">die for it</text>
  <text start="286.98" dur="5.7">you can&amp;#39;t find that anywhere okay so I</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="4.47">think we can pretty much discount the</text>
  <text start="292.68" dur="5.76">fact that they were lying and in fact</text>
  <text start="295.68" dur="5.22">most scholars will admit that the</text>
  <text start="298.44" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;ll admit that if nothing else the</text>
  <text start="300.9" dur="5.4">disciples at least sincerely believed</text>
  <text start="302.82" dur="4.83">that Yahshua had appeared to them okay</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="3.089">but again we come back to the main point</text>
  <text start="307.65" dur="3.21">which is we know that just believing</text>
  <text start="309.389" dur="4.651">something to be true doesn&amp;#39;t make it</text>
  <text start="310.86" dur="4.95">true okay so let&amp;#39;s consider the second</text>
  <text start="314.04" dur="3.15">alternative maybe the disciples had</text>
  <text start="315.81" dur="2.55">hallucinate it the whole thing either</text>
  <text start="317.19" dur="3.12">they were just crazy</text>
  <text start="318.36" dur="4.85">they were just insane and bonkers and</text>
  <text start="320.31" dur="5.94">they had just seen this hallucination</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="5.29">well the hallucination theory it really</text>
  <text start="326.25" dur="5.04">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense either because</text>
  <text start="328.5" dur="4.5">first of all it can&amp;#39;t explain the</text>
  <text start="331.29" dur="4.17">physical nature of the appearances I</text>
  <text start="333" dur="4.11">mean we have records of the disciples</text>
  <text start="335.46" dur="3.75">eating and drinking with Yahshua</text>
  <text start="337.11" dur="5.88">touching him I mean Thomas puts his</text>
  <text start="339.21" dur="6.81">hands right into Yahshua&amp;#39;s side that</text>
  <text start="342.99" dur="6.09">can&amp;#39;t be done with hallucinations and</text>
  <text start="346.02" dur="5.88">then also this is even more illogical</text>
  <text start="349.08" dur="5.1">how could ten individuals have the same</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="3.93">hallucination that that doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="354.18" dur="3.12">sense</text>
  <text start="355.83" dur="3.99">hallucinations are very highly</text>
  <text start="357.3" dur="5.79">individual they&amp;#39;re not group projections</text>
  <text start="359.82" dur="5.88">I mean I&amp;#39;ll just give an example if I</text>
  <text start="363.09" dur="3.93">walk into a room and say you know walk</text>
  <text start="365.7" dur="3.27">into a room with maybe four or five of</text>
  <text start="367.02" dur="3.78">my friends in the room and I say hey</text>
  <text start="368.97" dur="4.5">guys wasn&amp;#39;t that a great dream that that</text>
  <text start="370.8" dur="4.98">I had last night no they&amp;#39;re gonna look</text>
  <text start="373.47" dur="4.77">at me like I&amp;#39;m crazy because we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="375.78" dur="5.639">share dreams you&amp;#39;ll have a dream I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="378.24" dur="4.89">have a dream you know so you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="381.419" dur="4.771">these mass hallucinations that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="383.13" dur="4.8">happen again show me one example in</text>
  <text start="386.19" dur="3.18">history where a mass hallucination</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="5.7">happens where everyone sees the same</text>
  <text start="389.37" dur="6.24">elucidation doesn&amp;#39;t happen and then</text>
  <text start="393.63" dur="4.86">what&amp;#39;s even more illogical about the</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="4.95">hallucination theory is how would that</text>
  <text start="398.49" dur="4.23">explain the Apostle Paul</text>
  <text start="400.56" dur="5.22">converted three years after the</text>
  <text start="402.72" dur="5.28">resurrection I remember Paul shall he</text>
  <text start="405.78" dur="3.84">was avidly against the Christian</text>
  <text start="408" dur="3.36">movement he was persecuting them he was</text>
  <text start="409.62" dur="4.41">dragging them out of their houses taking</text>
  <text start="411.36" dur="5.25">them to be stoned so how could he have</text>
  <text start="414.03" dur="5.4">elucidated yahshua what his mind who was</text>
  <text start="416.61" dur="6.12">that was against Christianity his mind</text>
  <text start="419.43" dur="4.98">somehow in invented an appearance</text>
  <text start="422.73" dur="3.81">because he&amp;#39;s just so wanted to see</text>
  <text start="424.41" dur="4.229">oshawa but that that doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="426.54" dur="6.15">sense at all</text>
  <text start="428.639" dur="5.34">and of course this comes back to you</text>
  <text start="432.69" dur="4.5">know what these videos are about the</text>
  <text start="433.979" dur="5.241">hallucination theory does not deal with</text>
  <text start="437.19" dur="4.789">the evidence that there&amp;#39;s an empty tomb</text>
  <text start="439.22" dur="6.97">which we dealt with in the last video</text>
  <text start="441.979" dur="6.071">okay so it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious just looking</text>
  <text start="446.19" dur="3.87">at the facts using logic the disciples</text>
  <text start="448.05" dur="3.36">they could not have been lying and they</text>
  <text start="450.06" dur="3.45">could not have been crazy they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="451.41" dur="5.52">have been hallucinating so there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="453.51" dur="6.06">one possibility left the disciples</text>
  <text start="456.93" dur="5.43">believed they had seen the risen Yahshua</text>
  <text start="459.57" dur="6.599">because they really had seen the risen</text>
  <text start="462.36" dur="5.91">Yahshua so the resurrection appearance</text>
  <text start="466.169" dur="7.261">is alone demonstrate that the</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="7.05">resurrection actually happened so if if</text>
  <text start="473.43" dur="4.35">you&amp;#39;re an atheist or an agnostic and you</text>
  <text start="475.32" dur="5.55">want to deny that Yahshua resurrected</text>
  <text start="477.78" dur="6">from the dead you&amp;#39;re left now with two</text>
  <text start="480.87" dur="5.28">very big problems very big inexplicable</text>
  <text start="483.78" dur="5.16">mysteries first the fact that there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="486.15" dur="6.239">empty tomb and now the fact that there</text>
  <text start="488.94" dur="7.14">were appearances of this being called</text>
  <text start="492.389" dur="4.111">Yahshua that had risen from the dead all</text>
  <text start="496.08" dur="4.38">right</text>
  <text start="496.5" dur="5.97">so again the scripture says that if you</text>
  <text start="500.46" dur="5.429">say there is no yah that you&amp;#39;re a fool</text>
  <text start="502.47" dur="6">don&amp;#39;t be a fool and don&amp;#39;t deny that</text>
  <text start="505.889" dur="5.641">yasha Roche in the grave the true gospel</text>
  <text start="508.47" dur="4.68">is not what modern Christianity is</text>
  <text start="511.53" dur="3.78">promoting right now the true gospel it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.15" dur="5.91">found in the Bible in the written word</text>
  <text start="515.31" dur="5.55">and that is to admit you you&amp;#39;re wicked</text>
  <text start="519.06" dur="3.899">that you deserve</text>
  <text start="520.86" dur="4.71">everlasting like a fire because of how</text>
  <text start="522.959" dur="4.291">you&amp;#39;ve lived selfishly and that you come</text>
  <text start="525.57" dur="3.72">under the blood atonement of Yahshua</text>
  <text start="527.25" dur="4.26">that he spilled for you on the tree</text>
  <text start="529.29" dur="4.71">2,000 years ago so you could be forgiven</text>
  <text start="531.51" dur="3.99">of all your past iniquities your sins</text>
  <text start="534" dur="3.75">and that you could go and sin no more</text>
  <text start="535.5" dur="4.08">and then he will fill you with his</text>
  <text start="537.75" dur="5.94">spirit you get baptized in water and</text>
  <text start="539.58" dur="6.93">then you you are then drawn to want to</text>
  <text start="543.69" dur="4.56">put a smile on his face and so you start</text>
  <text start="546.51" dur="3.93">keeping the commandments the Torah you</text>
  <text start="548.25" dur="4.08">start obeying what the scripture says to</text>
  <text start="550.44" dur="4.41">do and how and you live your life</text>
  <text start="552.33" dur="5.43">according to the word of Yahweh to the</text>
  <text start="554.85" dur="5.58">Torah to the commandments and this is</text>
  <text start="557.76" dur="4.38">the true gospel there&amp;#39;s no reason not to</text>
  <text start="560.43" dur="3.69">follow it because there&amp;#39;s more than</text>
  <text start="562.14" dur="4.26">enough evidence that Yahshua rose from</text>
  <text start="564.12" dur="3.69">the dead all right this is the second</text>
  <text start="566.4" dur="3.93">video in the series there&amp;#39;ll be more</text>
