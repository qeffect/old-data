  <text start="0.56" dur="6.279">shabbat shalom this is Daniel John Lee</text>
  <text start="3.54" dur="5.99">with pora restoration ministries and I</text>
  <text start="6.839" dur="6.351">have this podcast special Shabbat</text>
  <text start="9.53" dur="7.3">podcast that I wanted to give today I</text>
  <text start="13.19" dur="6.4">attended a an era of Shabbat Bible study</text>
  <text start="16.83" dur="5.91">last night at a home home fellowship</text>
  <text start="19.59" dur="6.689">first time I&amp;#39;d ever been there and we</text>
  <text start="22.74" dur="7.109">were going over this the study from from</text>
  <text start="26.279" dur="4.861">a website called Bereans online org and</text>
  <text start="29.849" dur="3.21">I highly recommend that website by the</text>
  <text start="31.14" dur="5.189">way the the teacher that we listened to</text>
  <text start="33.059" dur="6.541">was very very good very noted it just</text>
  <text start="36.329" dur="6.091">very concise and succinct on how he</text>
  <text start="39.6" dur="4.799">explained the the scriptures but in any</text>
  <text start="42.42" dur="4.35">case as we were listening to the study</text>
  <text start="44.399" dur="4.081">there was kind of a point that he made</text>
  <text start="46.77" dur="3.39">that wasn&amp;#39;t really part of the study but</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="4.559">it was just kind of a an aside that he</text>
  <text start="50.16" dur="5.43">made but when he made it it really just</text>
  <text start="53.039" dur="6.391">sparked something within me and and gave</text>
  <text start="55.59" dur="7.859">me a just an amazing revelation and what</text>
  <text start="59.43" dur="5.67">he started with was Hebrews 8 4 so if</text>
  <text start="63.449" dur="6.061">you can just go ahead and turn in your</text>
  <text start="65.1" dur="6.949">Bibles to Hebrews 8 4 that&amp;#39;s the verse</text>
  <text start="69.51" dur="7.05">primarily that I want to deal with today</text>
  <text start="72.049" dur="8.771">because what I want to explore is the</text>
  <text start="76.56" dur="6.03">true Messiah vs. the false messiah now</text>
  <text start="80.82" dur="4.049">there&amp;#39;s a lot of kind of different</text>
  <text start="82.59" dur="4.05">pathways that you could take when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="4.621">exploring this topic because it&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="86.64" dur="6.26">topic but I want to keep this podcast</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="5.669">just very very simple very to the point</text>
  <text start="92.9" dur="4.66">and so I just want to deal with kind of</text>
  <text start="95.159" dur="5.82">one very very important element that</text>
  <text start="97.56" dur="5.37">that I think will be key for the Saints</text>
  <text start="100.979" dur="4.201">to really grasp ahold of as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="102.93" dur="5.04">entering into these last days because I</text>
  <text start="105.18" dur="5.64">think it&amp;#39;ll help help us to reach out to</text>
  <text start="107.97" dur="4.35">others and I think it&amp;#39;ll also help to to</text>
  <text start="110.82" dur="4.2">keep us on that that straight and narrow</text>
  <text start="112.32" dur="5.82">path so go ahead and just turn your in</text>
  <text start="115.02" dur="5.84">your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 8 in</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="5.28">verse 4 actually I&amp;#39;ll start in verse 3</text>
  <text start="120.86" dur="5.28">it says for every high priest is</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="5.459">ordained to offer gifts and sacrifice</text>
  <text start="126.14" dur="4.98">sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity</text>
  <text start="128.879" dur="4.19">that this man have someone also to offer</text>
  <text start="131.12" dur="3.72">for a fee</text>
  <text start="133.069" dur="4.711">we&amp;#39;re referring to Messiah to Yahshua</text>
  <text start="134.84" dur="6.239">for of Yahshua were on earth he should</text>
  <text start="137.78" dur="5.4">not be a priest seeing that there are</text>
  <text start="141.079" dur="4.5">priests that offer gifts according to</text>
  <text start="143.18" dur="4.589">the Torah okay so what this author is</text>
  <text start="145.579" dur="3.72">saying here is look Yahshua is of the</text>
  <text start="147.769" dur="4.8">mikkel Zadok priesthood which is</text>
  <text start="149.299" dur="4.951">spiritual it&amp;#39;s up in heaven he&amp;#39;s serving</text>
  <text start="152.569" dur="4.381">in the the heavenly Tabernacles as a</text>
  <text start="154.25" dur="4.049">priest but if he were down on earth he</text>
  <text start="156.95" dur="4.739">would not be a priest</text>
  <text start="158.299" dur="4.89">why well because on earth there is a</text>
  <text start="161.689" dur="4.17">priesthood already established there is</text>
  <text start="163.189" dur="5.211">the Levitical ariane ik priesthood and</text>
  <text start="165.859" dur="5.431">and we know this we know this from torah</text>
  <text start="168.4" dur="4.66">and that that priesthood unlike what you</text>
  <text start="171.29" dur="4.169">know christian dogma may thieves has</text>
  <text start="173.06" dur="5.519">never passed away it has not passed away</text>
  <text start="175.459" dur="6.9">in fact we know very very clearly from</text>
  <text start="178.579" dur="5.55">scripture that these animal sacrifices</text>
  <text start="182.359" dur="3.36">and offerings and oblations that the</text>
  <text start="184.129" dur="3.871">Levitical priesthood is were deign to do</text>
  <text start="185.719" dur="5.13">will in fact we be doing this again in</text>
  <text start="188" dur="6.78">fact we know this if you turn to to</text>
  <text start="190.849" dur="6.39">Malachi Malachi chapter 3 there&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="194.78" dur="4.819">very interesting passage that that</text>
  <text start="197.239" dur="6.24">proves this beyond a shadow of a doubt</text>
  <text start="199.599" dur="7.121">if you start in verse verse 2 Malachi</text>
  <text start="203.479" dur="5.641">chapter 3 verse 2 says but who may abide</text>
  <text start="206.72" dur="5.25">the day of his coming again we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="209.12" dur="6.509">talking about Yahshua who shall stand</text>
  <text start="211.97" dur="6.139">when Yahshua appears for Yahshua is like</text>
  <text start="215.629" dur="5.31">a refiners fire and like fuller soap and</text>
  <text start="218.109" dur="5.65">Yahshua will sit as a refiner and a</text>
  <text start="220.939" dur="5.25">purifier of silver at Yahshua shall</text>
  <text start="223.759" dur="6.09">purify the sons of Levi and purge them</text>
  <text start="226.189" dur="5.7">as gold and silver that they talking</text>
  <text start="229.849" dur="4.801">about the sons of Levi may offer unto</text>
  <text start="231.889" dur="4.921">Yahweh an offering in righteousness then</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="4.35">shall the offering of Yehuda and</text>
  <text start="236.81" dur="4.379">yerushalayim be pleasant at the Yahweh</text>
  <text start="239" dur="4.709">as in the days of old and as in former</text>
  <text start="241.189" dur="4.41">years so we know that when Yahshua</text>
  <text start="243.709" dur="4.53">returns once again when he returns for</text>
  <text start="245.599" dur="4.41">the second time he is going to purge the</text>
  <text start="248.239" dur="4.11">sons of Levi this is kind of another</text>
  <text start="250.009" dur="4.68">reference to the the resurrection the</text>
  <text start="252.349" dur="4.29">seventh trumpet Resurrection he will</text>
  <text start="254.689" dur="5.491">purge the sons of Levi at this point and</text>
  <text start="256.639" dur="6.21">so at that point the sons of Levi will</text>
  <text start="260.18" dur="6.72">be officiating the priestly service and</text>
  <text start="262.849" dur="6.831">Yahshua will not be a priest he will be</text>
  <text start="266.9" dur="4.859">King remember when David he was a king</text>
  <text start="269.68" dur="4.84">David was not going into the temple</text>
  <text start="271.759" dur="5.521">doing the doing the sacrifices and</text>
  <text start="274.52" dur="4.619">oblations in fact King Saul tried to do</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="3.06">this and he got in a lot of trouble that</text>
  <text start="279.139" dur="3.511">was one of the reasons why he got his</text>
  <text start="280.34" dur="3.99">kingdom ripped from him Oh Yahshua when</text>
  <text start="282.65" dur="4.5">he returns to the earth he will not be a</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="4.35">priest just as Hebrews 8 4 says that</text>
  <text start="287.15" dur="2.549">priesthood has already been ordained on</text>
  <text start="288.68" dur="6.329">earth that&amp;#39;ll be the Levitical</text>
  <text start="289.699" dur="7.53">priesthood but the false messiah the</text>
  <text start="295.009" dur="5.431">false prophet the anti Messiah has</text>
  <text start="297.229" dur="8.101">discussed in Daniel and in Revelation he</text>
  <text start="300.44" dur="6.36">will come as a priest the false messiah</text>
  <text start="305.33" dur="3.72">will come as a priest</text>
  <text start="306.8" dur="4.11">remember how you read about how in the</text>
  <text start="309.05" dur="3.63">midst of the week he is going to go into</text>
  <text start="310.91" dur="4.83">the temple and he&amp;#39;s going to commit the</text>
  <text start="312.68" dur="4.59">abomination of desolation he is going to</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="4.83">go into the temple he&amp;#39;s going to declare</text>
  <text start="317.27" dur="5.31">himself Yahweh as Yahweh and he is going</text>
  <text start="320.57" dur="3.48">to try to officiate a priestly duty</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="3.45">inside this temple that&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="6.089">rebuilt in Jerusalem this is going to be</text>
  <text start="326.03" dur="6.93">the abomination of desolation and the</text>
  <text start="330.139" dur="5.581">true Yahshua the real Messiah is not</text>
  <text start="332.96" dur="6.3">going to be a priest he&amp;#39;s going to rule</text>
  <text start="335.72" dur="6.18">and reign as a king as a king on earth</text>
  <text start="339.26" dur="6.719">and the Levitical arianna priesthood</text>
  <text start="341.9" dur="6.6">will be functioning as the priests just</text>
  <text start="345.979" dur="4.171">as it was since it was established and</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="3.599">tore that has that has not changed</text>
  <text start="350.15" dur="4.739">and so this is what the situation is</text>
  <text start="352.099" dur="4.621">going to be so when you see someone</text>
  <text start="354.889" dur="4.201">claiming to be Yahweh Yahshua and he</text>
  <text start="356.72" dur="5.189">officiates as a high priest you know</text>
  <text start="359.09" dur="4.74">that that is not the real Yahshua that</text>
  <text start="361.909" dur="6">is not the real Messiah it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="363.83" dur="7.53">an imposter so I encourage you also to</text>
  <text start="367.909" dur="5.611">not only visit the Bereans online org</text>
  <text start="371.36" dur="5.64">that&amp;#39;s Bereans with an S by the way</text>
  <text start="373.52" dur="6.24">Bereans online org but also followers of</text>
  <text start="377" dur="4.77">accom they have a really good youtube</text>
  <text start="379.76" dur="3.54">series called the false Armageddon it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="3.84">a seven part youtube series and it</text>
  <text start="383.3" dur="4.56">really explores a lot of of the same</text>
  <text start="385.61" dur="4.32">type of concepts of the end times and</text>
  <text start="387.86" dur="4.23">the imposter in fact they just came out</text>
  <text start="389.93" dur="4.799">with a brand new DVD called the imposter</text>
  <text start="392.09" dur="4.049">that they they sent me in the mail and I</text>
  <text start="394.729" dur="3.24">don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ve put it online yet</text>
  <text start="396.139" dur="3.75">but if you contact them they&amp;#39;ll send one</text>
  <text start="397.969" dur="3.711">to you in it and it&amp;#39;s free they just</text>
  <text start="399.889" dur="5.43">run off love love offerings just like</text>
  <text start="401.68" dur="4.989">just like this ministry but but that</text>
  <text start="405.319" dur="3.331">imposter also goes into a lot more</text>
  <text start="406.669" dur="3.24">detail of the the true Messiah verses</text>
  <text start="408.65" dur="2.879">the false messiah but I just thought</text>
  <text start="409.909" dur="3.961">that this was a really powerful</text>
  <text start="411.529" dur="4.44">revelation and something to keep close</text>
  <text start="413.87" dur="4.62">to your heart as we&amp;#39;re entering into</text>
  <text start="415.969" dur="4.2">these these last days because I think</text>
  <text start="418.49" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very important to realize that</text>
  <text start="420.169" dur="4.731">when Yahshua does return he&amp;#39;s returning</text>
  <text start="422.18" dur="5.91">as a king and not not as a priest at all</text>
  <text start="424.9" dur="7.21">so I hope this I hope this short little</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="6.24">podcast ministered to you and I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="4.26">to I think as time goes on I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="434.33" dur="4.53">be exploring this topic and much further</text>
  <text start="436.37" dur="4.65">detail in fact right now as many of you</text>
  <text start="438.86" dur="4.589">know who follow my ministry to our</text>

  <text start="443.449" dur="4.52">the website again is spirits and tour</text>
  <text start="445.189" dur="5.01">comm I&amp;#39;m in the middle of writing a book</text>
  <text start="447.969" dur="5.051">love never fails and this is sort of</text>
  <text start="450.199" dur="4.74">charting my my spiritual journey but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="453.02" dur="5.22">almost done with this book and once I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="454.939" dur="6.06">done I am planning to write a new book</text>
  <text start="458.24" dur="4.38">called final blueprint and this book is</text>
  <text start="460.999" dur="3.751">going to primarily deal with just all</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="4.349">the the way that prophecy is sort of</text>
  <text start="464.75" dur="3.81">coming together and so this topic the</text>
  <text start="466.969" dur="2.79">the false messiah versus the treatments</text>
  <text start="468.56" dur="3.359">is something I&amp;#39;m going to be exploring</text>
  <text start="469.759" dur="4.53">in that book and in great great detail</text>
  <text start="471.919" dur="3.661">so hopefully this podcast kind of gives</text>
  <text start="474.289" dur="3.78">you a little taste of what that book is</text>
  <text start="475.58" dur="4.949">going to be about and and the type of</text>
  <text start="478.069" dur="4.861">stuff it&amp;#39;s going to explore but anyway I</text>
  <text start="480.529" dur="6.241">hope this I hope this greatly ministered</text>
  <text start="482.93" dur="7.229">to you there is a teaching on brands</text>
  <text start="486.77" dur="5.22">online org it&amp;#39;s called replacement</text>
  <text start="490.159" dur="4.051">covenant or new covenant I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.99" dur="3.419">the February 21st teaching you click on</text>
  <text start="494.21" dur="4.139">that that&amp;#39;s actually the teaching where</text>
  <text start="495.409" dur="4.591">I I kind of got this this aside from and</text>
  <text start="498.349" dur="3.3">the whole teaching is really really good</text>
  <text start="500" dur="3.569">it doesn&amp;#39;t so much Center on what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="501.649" dur="5.49">been talking about but it encompasses a</text>
  <text start="503.569" dur="4.951">whole topic about the book of Hebrews</text>
  <text start="507.139" dur="3.75">and it&amp;#39;s right context and how the</text>
  <text start="508.52" dur="3.929">covenants work and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="510.889" dur="4.621">well done so I highly recommend that</text>
  <text start="512.449" dur="5.34">teaching if if you can listen to that so</text>
  <text start="515.51" dur="4.98">just remember as the book of Hebrews</text>
  <text start="517.789" dur="5.37">states very clearly for if he if Yahshua</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="5.19">were on earth and we know he is going to</text>
  <text start="523.159" dur="4.711">be on earth once again he should not be</text>
  <text start="525.68" dur="4.529">a priest seeing that there are preset</text>
  <text start="527.87" dur="5.069">offer gifts according to the Torah</text>
  <text start="530.209" dur="6.961">he will be a king the imposter will come</text>
  <text start="532.939" dur="6.44">as a priest okay god bless you shabbat</text>
