  <text start="132.28" dur="5.37">job at testifying to the glory of yeah</text>
  <text start="133.989" dur="5.431">but in any case we don&amp;#39;t have to live in</text>
  <text start="137.65" dur="4.229">this mentality where where we say well</text>
  <text start="139.42" dur="4.799">you know YouTube and Twitter they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="141.879" dur="4.261">just so liberal and they&amp;#39;re so bought</text>

  <text start="146.14" dur="3.45">that you know if you really are are over</text>
  <text start="148.45" dur="5.849">the target you&amp;#39;re gonna get taken down</text>
  <text start="149.59" dur="7.2">no we can use the power of prayer to</text>
  <text start="154.299" dur="5.19">overcome that and and I I hope people</text>
  <text start="156.79" dur="5.3">learn that yes I was concerned when I</text>
  <text start="159.489" dur="6.03">realized that YouTube sent me that email</text>
  <text start="162.09" dur="5.19">and you know but I was like okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="165.519" dur="5.19">pray let&amp;#39;s pray let&amp;#39;s pray let&amp;#39;s pray</text>
  <text start="167.28" dur="9.609">and look at what the power of prayer did</text>
  <text start="170.709" dur="7.68">everything&amp;#39;s fully restored now so he</text>
  <text start="176.889" dur="2.28">that is within us is greater than he</text>
  <text start="178.389" dur="3.72">that is in the world</text>
  <text start="179.169" dur="4.261">that&amp;#39;s a descriptor teaches I wanted to</text>
  <text start="182.109" dur="3.421">talk a little bit more about Leviticus</text>
  <text start="183.43" dur="4.739">23 and I might do a white board teaching</text>
  <text start="185.53" dur="4.5">on this eventually but Leviticus 23 is a</text>
  <text start="188.169" dur="4.71">chapter that goes over the seven</text>
  <text start="190.03" dur="4.47">actually eight feasts because it talks</text>
  <text start="192.879" dur="3.03">about the weekly Shabbat which is the</text>
  <text start="194.5" dur="3.599">feast run right now it happens every</text>
  <text start="195.909" dur="4.621">week from Friday night to Saturday night</text>
  <text start="198.099" dur="4.38">the seventh day of the week days always</text>
  <text start="200.53" dur="3">begin at sunset because in Genesis that</text>
  <text start="202.479" dur="2.641">says there was evening and there was</text>
  <text start="203.53" dur="3.449">morning.the first day there was evening</text>
  <text start="205.12" dur="3.449">and there was morning the second day if</text>
  <text start="206.979" dur="3.391">you actually go to Leviticus 23 talks</text>
  <text start="208.569" dur="3.721">about the high Sabbath if you um Kippur</text>
  <text start="210.37" dur="3.329">goes from the evening of the ninth day</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="2.789">of the seventh month to the evening of</text>
  <text start="213.699" dur="3.6">the tenth day of the seventh month so</text>
  <text start="215.079" dur="4.711">days always begin as the Sun goes and as</text>
  <text start="217.299" dur="5.461">Q says the darkness to light starts at</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="4.68">night and goes through the day so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="222.76" dur="3.659">a biblical principle Hebrew Jewish</text>
  <text start="224.47" dur="4.259">principle the day begins as the Sun sets</text>
  <text start="226.419" dur="3.57">so the seventh day the week Shabbat is</text>
  <text start="228.729" dur="4.23">the first feast has talked about</text>
  <text start="229.989" dur="4.2">Leviticus 23 it is that it is the day</text>
  <text start="232.959" dur="2.7">we&amp;#39;re on right now it happens every week</text>
  <text start="234.189" dur="3.33">from Friday night to Saturday night the</text>
  <text start="235.659" dur="3.931">seventh day of the week and then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.519" dur="4.981">seven other annual feast days that it</text>
  <text start="239.59" dur="4.41">goes over but a lot when light will</text>
  <text start="242.5" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t realize is that as you go through</text>
  <text start="244" dur="4.769">these feast days that we celebrate every</text>
  <text start="247" dur="3.509">single year they all point toward</text>
  <text start="248.769" dur="4.201">Yahshua of course but they&amp;#39;re also a</text>
  <text start="250.509" dur="6.54">prophetic time calendar so what I mean</text>
  <text start="252.97" dur="6.989">by that is Passover unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="257.049" dur="4.081">first fruits and Shavuot Pentecost was</text>
  <text start="259.959" dur="3.061">all happened in the spring</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="4.92">those were were done</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="4.44">fulfilled by Yahshua 2,000 years ago so</text>
  <text start="266.05" dur="3.51">when he first came as a suffering</text>
  <text start="267.46" dur="4.049">servant remember when you go to the</text>
  <text start="269.56" dur="3.389">Tanakh which is the Torah the prophets</text>
  <text start="271.509" dur="3.421">the Psalms the Minor Prophets</text>
  <text start="272.949" dur="3.601">there are always two different pictures</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="4.59">of the Messiah one is a suffering</text>
  <text start="276.55" dur="4.98">servant and the other one is a reigning</text>
  <text start="279.52" dur="4.23">king he&amp;#39;s only done the suffering</text>
  <text start="281.53" dur="3.72">servant one so there&amp;#39;s even if you look</text>
  <text start="283.75" dur="3.24">in just the Torah there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="285.25" dur="3.9">different comings of Yahshua there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="286.99" dur="3.929">different different returns so one</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="4.29">already happened 2,000 years ago he was</text>
  <text start="290.919" dur="4.5">crucified on Passover buried on</text>
  <text start="293.44" dur="3.509">unleavened bread he rose is the first</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="4.021">fruit from from among the dead on the</text>
  <text start="296.949" dur="5.701">feast of firstfruits and he poured out</text>
  <text start="299.44" dur="5.009">his Holy Spirit the raw Kadosh on 120</text>
  <text start="302.65" dur="4.739">believers in Jerusalem on the feast of</text>
  <text start="304.449" dur="5">Pentecost or Shavuot which was also the</text>
  <text start="307.389" dur="4.921">very day thousands of years earlier that</text>
  <text start="309.449" dur="3.96">Torah the Torah was given to Moshe on</text>
  <text start="312.31" dur="3.449">Mount Sinai</text>
  <text start="313.409" dur="3.491">so the Torah was given on that day and</text>
  <text start="315.759" dur="2.671">then it was fulfilled only with the</text>
  <text start="316.9" dur="3.96">spirit because only through the spirit</text>
  <text start="318.43" dur="4.38">can we obey the tour in fact Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="320.86" dur="3.75">talks about how he gives his spirit to</text>
  <text start="322.81" dur="6.15">help us walk in his statutes and</text>
  <text start="324.61" dur="6.929">Commandments and laws so that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.96" dur="3.929">that that those first four feasts are in</text>
  <text start="331.539" dur="2.821">the spring they were fulfilled 2,000</text>
  <text start="332.889" dur="3.661">years ago then right in the middle of</text>
  <text start="334.36" dur="4.02">talking about all these feast days it</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="3.66">talks about not gleaning the corners of</text>
  <text start="338.38" dur="4.8">your field but leaving it to the</text>
  <text start="340.21" dur="5.16">foreigner the poor the widow and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.18" dur="4.47">a picture of the Gentiles for the next</text>
  <text start="345.37" dur="5.19">2,000 years the the the foreigner or the</text>
  <text start="347.65" dur="4.41">Gentile would be allowed to be grafted</text>
  <text start="350.56" dur="5.659">into Israel through the blood of Messiah</text>
  <text start="352.06" dur="6.719">and so talks about don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="356.219" dur="4.871">reap the corners of your field but all</text>

  <text start="361.09" dur="5.43">to the poor the widow the foreigner the</text>
  <text start="363.159" dur="5.581">Gentile this by the way is why when we</text>
  <text start="366.52" dur="4.199">get an increase in our income we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="3.62">take all of it we give the firstfruits</text>
  <text start="370.719" dur="5.85">of that to the poor the widow the orphan</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="6.16">the foreigner the stranger so that</text>
  <text start="376.569" dur="4.44">typifies the time of the Gentiles it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="378.52" dur="4.56">the summertime you got the spring feasts</text>
