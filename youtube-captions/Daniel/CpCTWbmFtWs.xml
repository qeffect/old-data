  <text start="208.61" dur="5.45">Sabbath hike I talked about and asked my</text>
  <text start="210.95" dur="5.789">subscribers to help me basically Barry</text>
  <text start="214.06" dur="6.37">Judge Susan Normie and an avalanche of</text>
  <text start="216.739" dur="6.391">letters telling her about how wicked she</text>
  <text start="220.43" dur="5.76">was to cut me off from my children six</text>
  <text start="223.13" dur="4.62">years ago and one subscriber suggested</text>
  <text start="226.19" dur="3.09">well Daniel rather than sending that</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="3.81">letter every month why don&amp;#39;t he send it</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="4.35">every week so I think that was a great</text>
  <text start="231.56" dur="3.57">suggestion so I changed the letter to</text>
  <text start="233.63" dur="3.329">say that rather than sending it every</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="3.24">month I&amp;#39;ll send it every week made a</text>
  <text start="236.959" dur="3.661">bunch of copies of that letter yesterday</text>
  <text start="238.37" dur="4.98">at the library and the first one will be</text>
  <text start="240.62" dur="4.47">going out so appreciate that suggestion</text>
  <text start="243.35" dur="4.26">some people said Daniel you shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="245.09" dur="4.08">advertising your your plans to the judge</text>
  <text start="247.61" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t tell her about the parable that</text>
  <text start="249.17" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re gonna be sending it guys we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="250.94" dur="3.33">not children of darkness we&amp;#39;re not we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="253.07" dur="3">not henchman of Satan where we have to</text>
  <text start="254.27" dur="4.11">hide and do things in secret we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="256.07" dur="3.46">children of the light for followers of</text>
  <text start="258.38" dur="3.07">Yahshua</text>
  <text start="259.53" dur="3.63">look at that there&amp;#39;s an eagle you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="261.45" dur="3">even see it Kenya there&amp;#39;s an eagle I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="263.16" dur="4.16">gonna get close to that tree so I can</text>
  <text start="264.45" dur="4.95">show you guys the eagle</text>
  <text start="267.32" dur="4.81">we&amp;#39;re shelter under the light we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="5.22">have to hide our plans I&amp;#39;m quoting the</text>
  <text start="272.13" dur="3.84">scripture so we&amp;#39;ll convict Susan norbi</text>
  <text start="274.62" dur="3.51">and hopefully bring her to repentance</text>
  <text start="275.97" dur="4.86">but his word does not return void and</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="4.83">that parable about the widow writing the</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="3.99">judge over or not writing but the widow</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="2.94">pleading to the judge over and over</text>
  <text start="284.82" dur="2.46">again and finally the judge relents</text>
  <text start="285.9" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s a very powerful parable that</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="6.21">Yahshua taught and so I&amp;#39;m not gonna hide</text>
  <text start="290.28" dur="6.42">that guys we need to be my what do you</text>
  <text start="293.49" dur="4.71">think more like David okay I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="296.7" dur="2.79">trying to condemn some of you but some</text>
  <text start="298.2" dur="3.03">of you have this attitude of light</text>
  <text start="299.49" dur="3.36">cowering like the like the Israelites</text>
  <text start="301.23" dur="5.16">when they were afraid of Goliath</text>
  <text start="302.85" dur="7.59">King Saul was cowering in his in his</text>
  <text start="306.39" dur="6.87">castle and and and not afraid to go out</text>
  <text start="310.44" dur="4.83">to fight the Philistines and David was</text>
  <text start="313.26" dur="4.17">like come on guys this is an</text>
  <text start="315.27" dur="4.62">uncircumcised Philistine let&amp;#39;s go guys</text>
  <text start="317.43" dur="5.4">we need to be bold remember the bold the</text>
  <text start="319.89" dur="4.41">righteous are as bold as a lion but the</text>
  <text start="322.83" dur="2.79">wicked spirits peep in muttering so</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="3.23">don&amp;#39;t listen to those wicked spirits</text>
  <text start="325.62" dur="4.62">that peep and mutter and try to put fear</text>
  <text start="327.53" dur="6.06">but be bold bold was a lion</text>
  <text start="330.24" dur="9.78">that&amp;#39;s what Yahshua is calling us to be</text>
  <text start="333.59" dur="8.32">a little wet here so somebody had asked</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="4.2">me to do a little teaching on or</text>
  <text start="341.91" dur="6.24">expounding on the thoughts I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="344.22" dur="7.02">giving about whether you&amp;#39;re ruled by</text>
  <text start="348.15" dur="4.5">fear or ruled by love because every</text>
  <text start="351.24" dur="4.71">human being on the planet is either</text>
  <text start="352.65" dur="4.86">ruled by fear or ruled by love now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="355.95" dur="3.42">not talking about a holy fear there is</text>
  <text start="357.51" dur="3.9">the scripture that says the fear of</text>
  <text start="359.37" dur="4.23">Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom</text>
  <text start="361.41" dur="6.18">and that&amp;#39;s a good type of fear that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.6" dur="5.58">sort of a reverence all of y&amp;#39;all but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="367.59" dur="3.27">talking about like this inch anxious</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="3.54">fear that consumes you and makes you</text>
  <text start="370.86" dur="4.74">sort of selfish and you you&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="372.72" dur="4.949">trying to live for self-preservation and</text>
  <text start="375.6" dur="3.36">you&amp;#39;re just afraid afraid and you think</text>
  <text start="377.669" dur="4.711">the government&amp;#39;s after you and blah blah</text>
  <text start="378.96" dur="5.37">blah well yes we are to be wise as</text>
  <text start="382.38" dur="3.84">serpents harmless as doves and I know</text>
  <text start="384.33" dur="3.209">there are a lot of rogue elements within</text>
  <text start="386.22" dur="3.86">the government right now that trumps</text>
  <text start="387.539" dur="5">having to fight against and I know</text>
  <text start="390.08" dur="6.24">things are perilous we live in perilous</text>
  <text start="392.539" dur="5.791">times but at the same time love believes</text>
  <text start="396.32" dur="4.56">all things love hopes all things love</text>
  <text start="398.33" dur="5.16">never fails Yahshua&amp;#39;s love that he fills</text>
  <text start="400.88" dur="4.56">us with allows us to live in a peaceful</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="4.82">state even when we&amp;#39;re being attacked and</text>
  <text start="405.44" dur="5.61">maligned and character assassinated or</text>
  <text start="408.31" dur="5.829">you know we get threatened by the</text>
  <text start="411.05" dur="5.179">government or whatever that peace and</text>
  <text start="414.139" dur="4.53">that love transcends all understanding</text>
  <text start="416.229" dur="3.94">it only comes through repentance guys</text>
  <text start="418.669" dur="3.451">you got to repent then which means you</text>
  <text start="420.169" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t just acknowledge what you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="422.12" dur="4.799">is wrong and confess it but you turn</text>
  <text start="424.099" dur="4.261">from it you you&amp;#39;re no longer living in</text>
  <text start="426.919" dur="3.961">sin committing sin and the only way that</text>
  <text start="428.36" dur="4.08">can happen is through Yahshua he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="430.88" dur="5.129">only one that can give us the power to</text>
  <text start="432.44" dur="5.37">overcome sin and to be able to live in a</text>
  <text start="436.009" dur="8.311">state of love rather than in a state of</text>
  <text start="437.81" dur="8.31">fear and anxiety and worry so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.32" dur="4.319">either ruled by fear or ruled by love</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="6.6">and this kind of ties into the the</text>
  <text start="448.639" dur="7.381">passage that I read from first John</text>
  <text start="452.72" dur="4.699">chapter 3 6 4 through 11 last night for</text>
  <text start="456.02" dur="3.42">the Arab Shabbat Friday night study</text>
  <text start="457.419" dur="4.091">people are either children of God are</text>
  <text start="459.44" dur="3.93">children of the devil if you allow this</text>
  <text start="461.51" dur="3.96">selfish fear to consume you</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="3.63">and to consume your thoughts where</text>
  <text start="465.47" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;re just worried and worried and</text>
  <text start="467" dur="7.8">worried I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m gonna make it</text>
  <text start="469.22" dur="7.979">down that holiness then you know</text>
  <text start="474.8" dur="6.089">basically you&amp;#39;re gonna allow yourself to</text>
  <text start="477.199" dur="6.121">get your eyes off the Messiah and and</text>
  <text start="480.889" dur="9.991">start becoming someone you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="483.32" dur="9.569">be so you know Yahshua does all this</text>
  <text start="490.88" dur="3.87">work with his atonement and him meeting</text>
  <text start="492.889" dur="4.471">us and feelings of the Spirit he</text>
  <text start="494.75" dur="5.34">cleanses us from all sin but then he</text>
  <text start="497.36" dur="4.5">expects us to then once he&amp;#39;s filled us</text>
  <text start="500.09" dur="3.06">and and and cleanse us and Rudi</text>
  <text start="501.86" dur="5.01">Embassy&amp;#39;s expects us to start walking</text>
  <text start="503.15" dur="4.98">before him and living in love loving our</text>
  <text start="506.87" dur="4.2">fellow neighbor loving him with</text>
  <text start="508.13" dur="5.519">everything in us which will cause us and</text>
  <text start="511.07" dur="4.29">compel us and we have a desire to read</text>
  <text start="513.649" dur="3.091">the Bible and start implementing the</text>
  <text start="515.36" dur="3.33">Bible into our life we don&amp;#39;t just read</text>
  <text start="516.74" dur="4.229">it and forget about it we read it and</text>
  <text start="518.69" dur="4.04">actually put those things into practice</text>
  <text start="520.969" dur="5.701">in our lives</text>
  <text start="522.73" dur="5.98">and and and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how we live in</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="5.1">love and it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s an everyday thing</text>
  <text start="528.71" dur="6.09">you know you you you you have to always</text>
  <text start="531.77" dur="6.27">be working out the salvation with fear</text>

  <text start="557.27" dur="3.21">gonna get to another place of this trail</text>
  <text start="558.68" dur="3.33">because it doesn&amp;#39;t go all the way</text>
  <text start="560.48" dur="5.7">through like I thought it did so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.01" dur="8.91">gonna walk along this road to get to the</text>
  <text start="566.18" dur="8.04">other part of the trail so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="570.92" dur="6.68">important that every day we&amp;#39;re keeping</text>

  <text start="670.16" dur="3.48">after is the spiritual gifts and no</text>

  <text start="678.59" dur="6.87">around on the floor you gotta have both</text>
  <text start="681.97" dur="4.66">the spirit and the Torah that was the</text>
  <text start="685.46" dur="4.47">problem with the children of Israel they</text>
  <text start="686.63" dur="4.59">didn&amp;#39;t mix their their the their</text>
  <text start="689.93" dur="3.27">knowledge and understanding of Torah</text>
  <text start="691.22" dur="3.45">with faith so that first generation</text>
  <text start="693.2" dur="6.42">perished in the wilderness</text>
  <text start="694.67" dur="6.35">except for yahushua Joshua and Caleb but</text>
  <text start="699.62" dur="3.75">the little children grew up and they</text>
  <text start="701.02" dur="5.14">they did have that faith they mixed that</text>
  <text start="703.37" dur="5.33">faith with Torah and yah blessed them</text>
  <text start="706.16" dur="4.76">mightily and they took the promised land</text>
  <text start="708.7" dur="4.87">so that&amp;#39;s what we need we need to have</text>
  <text start="710.92" dur="5.2">both the truth of the Torah mix with</text>
  <text start="713.57" dur="6.11">faith and that&amp;#39;s what Hebrews 8 which is</text>
  <text start="716.12" dur="7.14">quoted from Jeremiah 31 is all about</text>
  <text start="719.68" dur="5.11">Hebrews 8 says that this Torah that was</text>
  <text start="723.26" dur="2.94">written on tablets of stone now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="724.79" dur="4.4">gonna be inscribed in our hearts and our</text>
  <text start="726.2" dur="5.49">minds so we don&amp;#39;t do away with the Torah</text>
  <text start="729.19" dur="3.79">fact it says right there in Hebrews 8 it</text>
  <text start="731.69" dur="3.6">says what was wrong with the covenant</text>
  <text start="732.98" dur="4.25">the Covenant was because the people this</text>
  <text start="735.29" dur="5.93">rights didn&amp;#39;t continue in it</text>
  <text start="737.23" dur="3.99">so y&amp;#39;all had to make a new covenant</text>
  <text start="741.94" dur="12.61">y&amp;#39;all had to make a new covenant that</text>
  <text start="751.79" dur="6.03">still kept the Torah so now he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="754.55" dur="5.73">stamp it in the blood of a son and now</text>
  <text start="757.82" dur="3.93">when we understand the sacrifice that</text>
  <text start="760.28" dur="3.66">Yahshua did for us it should break our</text>
  <text start="761.75" dur="3.77">hearts we should become broken and</text>
  <text start="763.94" dur="3.51">contrite and so thankful for him</text>
  <text start="765.52" dur="3.88">rescuing us from our own sin and</text>
  <text start="767.45" dur="3.87">selfishness that now we have an inward</text>
  <text start="769.4" dur="4.89">desire to obey the Torah through the</text>
  <text start="771.32" dur="5.52">gift of His Holy Spirit so the tour is</text>
  <text start="774.29" dur="5.1">not done away with it&amp;#39;s just all those</text>
  <text start="776.84" dur="4.17">blood sacrifices that were done in the</text>
  <text start="779.39" dur="5">Tanakh we&amp;#39;re pointing toward the</text>
  <text start="781.01" dur="6.749">ultimate blood atonement that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="784.39" dur="6.279">provided on Passover 2,000 years ago</text>
  <text start="787.759" dur="5.85">and then don&amp;#39;t stop it his death like</text>
  <text start="790.669" dur="4.621">the Catholics they they just put his</text>
  <text start="793.609" dur="3.42">crucifix everywhere in his crucifixion</text>
  <text start="795.29" dur="2.879">you don&amp;#39;t stop there three days and</text>
  <text start="797.029" dur="3.27">three nights later you have the victory</text>
  <text start="798.169" dur="4.17">at Shabbat sending in the feast of</text>
  <text start="800.299" dur="4.59">firstfruits yasho is the first trip from</text>
  <text start="802.339" dur="3.96">the dead his resurrecting power is what</text>
  <text start="804.889" dur="4.081">enables us to live a life of victory</text>
  <text start="806.299" dur="5.28">over sin and to be able to live in love</text>
  <text start="808.97" dur="5.459">rather than in fear and we can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="811.579" dur="7.081">in our own strength that&amp;#39;s why it says</text>
  <text start="814.429" dur="9.87">in our weakness he is strong we can only</text>
  <text start="818.66" dur="7.139">do it we can only do it if we have him</text>
  <text start="824.299" dur="3.15">living inside us and thrown in our heart</text>
  <text start="825.799" dur="5.22">that says you know man&amp;#39;s heart is</text>
  <text start="827.449" dur="6.57">deceitful above all things that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="831.019" dur="7.5">have to have Yahshua enthroned in our</text>
  <text start="834.019" dur="7.641">hearts so that the deceit that naturally</text>
  <text start="838.519" dur="6.72">comes from us won&amp;#39;t come from us anymore</text>
  <text start="841.66" dur="5.859">the Yahshua will guide us now his Spirit</text>
  <text start="845.239" dur="5.18">says in first Corinthians 2:15 and 16</text>
  <text start="847.519" dur="5.55">that now we have the mind of Messiah</text>
  <text start="850.419" dur="4.931">he&amp;#39;s granted us the privilege of having</text>
  <text start="853.069" dur="4.32">his spirit living with us in it even</text>
  <text start="855.35" dur="4.62">Jesus told us decides this Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="857.389" dur="3.87">will guide you into all truth so if</text>

  <text start="864.589" dur="5.7">convict you that you&amp;#39;re wicked and just</text>
