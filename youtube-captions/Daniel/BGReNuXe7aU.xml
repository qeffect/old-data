  <text start="13.71" dur="5.22">the 42nd Omer which means we&amp;#39;re only a</text>
  <text start="16.68" dur="5.49">little more than a week away from Shavit</text>
  <text start="18.93" dur="6.06">in fact not tonight as the shabbat ends</text>
  <text start="22.17" dur="6.679">but next week as the sabbath day ends</text>
  <text start="24.99" dur="8.28">that is when chef wote pentecost begins</text>
  <text start="28.849" dur="8.831">hallelujah so you may hear that my voice</text>
  <text start="33.27" dur="7.859">is a little more lower and scratchy than</text>
  <text start="37.68" dur="7.14">normal and that is because Jerry brother</text>
  <text start="41.129" dur="5.91">of mine from khm from the messianic</text>

  <text start="73.95" dur="4.739">is from Poland her grandparents were</text>
  <text start="75.72" dur="7.14">from Warsaw Poland so it&amp;#39;s definitely a</text>

  <text start="82.86" dur="4.259">is from Paul and his mom is from Ukraine</text>
  <text start="84.65" dur="5.5">but in any case we had a wonderful time</text>
  <text start="87.119" dur="4.771">preaching last shabbat and i was so</text>
  <text start="90.15" dur="3.39">surprised because I thought he was just</text>
  <text start="91.89" dur="4.439">going to come with me and pray and may</text>
  <text start="93.54" dur="4.619">in film with the iPad but he was still</text>

  <text start="102.93" dur="5.04">blessed by that Bailey you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="105.78" dur="4.53">been making it a habit to go out and do</text>
  <text start="107.97" dur="4.829">open-air street preaching on Shabbat but</text>

  <text start="120" dur="3.54">happen but we thought you know why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="4.89">we go friday night because there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="123.54" dur="5.07">huge rose festival going on in downtown</text>

  <text start="134.67" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s a fair going on so Jerry and I</text>
  <text start="137.52" dur="4.53">as soon as I got off work and I got my</text>
  <text start="139.83" dur="4.23">stuff together for Shabbat Jerry and I</text>
  <text start="142.05" dur="4.71">he met me here my apartment and we</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="4.32">walked down to the waterfront and we had</text>
  <text start="146.76" dur="4.08">a wonderful wonderful evening of</text>
  <text start="148.38" dur="5.79">preaching we got there I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="150.84" dur="5.82">little after six o&amp;#39;clock and stayed</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="4.65">there until 930-10 till dusk so as</text>
  <text start="156.66" dur="7.02">literally as the Sabbath was beginning I</text>
  <text start="158.82" dur="6.87">had my shofar and blowing it and then he</text>
  <text start="163.68" dur="4.11">and I tag-team preached the whole night</text>
  <text start="165.69" dur="3.45">and it was it was interesting there were</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="5.1">some people who really responded there</text>
  <text start="169.14" dur="6">was one guy named Jeremy and he</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="4.05">initially seemed almost I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="175.14" dur="3.599">that he was covered by some bad spirits</text>
  <text start="176.94" dur="6.12">that I said he needed deliverance and</text>
  <text start="178.739" dur="6.481">then something opened up and we talked</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="4.92">for a while as Jerry was preaching and</text>
  <text start="185.22" dur="5.18">and he seems he was mentioning how I</text>
  <text start="187.98" dur="6.18">even wanted to be baptized and so I</text>
  <text start="190.4" dur="5.62">offered him to come to this shadow</text>
  <text start="194.16" dur="4.98">Pentecost gathering that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
