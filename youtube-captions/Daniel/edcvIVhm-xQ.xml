  <text start="7.649" dur="8.221">years ago back in the year late 2000</text>
  <text start="10.559" dur="7.831">early 2001 when a man of yaa filled the</text>
  <text start="15.87" dur="7.62">Holy Spirit laid hands on me and he</text>
  <text start="18.39" dur="7.86">prophesied over me and he said I am an</text>
  <text start="23.49" dur="4.879">apostle now I don&amp;#39;t go around telling</text>
  <text start="26.25" dur="4.89">people that I&amp;#39;m an apostle very often</text>
  <text start="28.369" dur="6.071">but I do feel led to let people know</text>
  <text start="31.14" dur="5.189">that I am an apostle and if you read</text>
  <text start="34.44" dur="3.84">about the fivefold ministry in the Brit</text>
  <text start="36.329" dur="4.89">hadashah it says first there are</text>
  <text start="38.28" dur="5.25">apostles secondarily prophets third it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="41.219" dur="4.141">teachers fourth pastures and on it goes</text>
  <text start="43.53" dur="5.279">in other words the apostles and prophets</text>
  <text start="45.36" dur="5.49">are the highest office in the body of</text>
  <text start="48.809" dur="4.651">Messiah and then teachers and</text>
  <text start="50.85" dur="6.779">evangelists and pastors are submitted to</text>
  <text start="53.46" dur="5.759">them so Pastor Rick and elder Dale need</text>
  <text start="57.629" dur="6.061">to be submitted to me because I&amp;#39;m an</text>
  <text start="59.219" dur="6.961">apostle now in first Timothy 1:20</text>
  <text start="63.69" dur="4.98">Apostle Paul who was an apostle like me</text>
  <text start="66.18" dur="5.759">he delivered over hymenaeus and</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="4.53">Alexander to Satan because they had made</text>
  <text start="71.939" dur="3.18">shipwreck of their faith and so he</text>
  <text start="73.2" dur="3.239">delivered them over to Satan that they</text>
  <text start="75.119" dur="2.691">did be taught not to blaspheme that</text>
  <text start="76.439" dur="7.021">they&amp;#39;ll be saved on the day of judgment</text>
  <text start="77.81" dur="8.14">so Rick I I discovered because rick has</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="5.699">a special set of a cornerstone where he</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="4.68">actually will record the service</text>
  <text start="89.159" dur="3.511">livestreaming and then it will be on</text>
  <text start="90.63" dur="6.57">youtube so i started watching the</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="6.57">YouTube from October 21st and yah led me</text>
  <text start="97.2" dur="5.22">to a specific part in that to our</text>
  <text start="99.24" dur="4.8">YouTube where Rick as he&amp;#39;s in the middle</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="4.379">of the service at Cornerstone he starts</text>
  <text start="104.04" dur="4.14">talking about me and he doesn&amp;#39;t name me</text>
  <text start="106.799" dur="3.36">by name but he says there&amp;#39;s a certain</text>
  <text start="108.18" dur="3.63">individual he&amp;#39;s been troubling us and we</text>
  <text start="110.159" dur="4.591">need to have people go around and start</text>
  <text start="111.81" dur="5.46">praying the grounds to remove everything</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="4.799">of this individuals done what Rick is</text>
  <text start="117.27" dur="5.699">doing whether he knows it or not is he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="119.549" dur="5.85">practicing witchcraft and necromancy so</text>
  <text start="122.969" dur="5.611">because of that yah has guided me to do</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="6.901">a first Timothy 1:20 against Rick his</text>
  <text start="128.58" dur="4.78">wife Sharon elder Dale and Raylan and</text>
  <text start="132.3" dur="2.8">anyone else in</text>
  <text start="133.36" dur="5.28">owner stone who currently has sin in</text>
  <text start="135.1" dur="6.42">their lives now just to clarify Rick is</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="5.01">currently an unrepentant sin because</text>
  <text start="141.52" dur="3.51">he&amp;#39;s threatened me a believer with</text>
  <text start="143.65" dur="3.21">police arrest if I show up at</text>
  <text start="145.03" dur="4.83">Cornerstone that is a violation of first</text>
  <text start="146.86" dur="5.46">Corinthians 6 Dale the elder is also an</text>
  <text start="149.86" dur="4.32">unrepentant sin because he told me face</text>
  <text start="152.32" dur="3.63">to face that he will not wear the blues</text>
  <text start="154.18" dur="3.78">easy even though he&amp;#39;s convicted to do so</text>
  <text start="155.95" dur="3.21">by the spirit and the word he won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="157.96" dur="3.39">because he&amp;#39;s worried his franchise</text>
  <text start="159.16" dur="4.5">owners will cause him trouble with his</text>
  <text start="161.35" dur="4.59">insurance business so he&amp;#39;s an idolatry</text>
  <text start="163.66" dur="4.11">so both of these men are in currently an</text>
  <text start="165.94" dur="3.15">unrepentant sin and there&amp;#39;s people at</text>
  <text start="167.77" dur="3.03">Cornerstone who are currently an</text>
  <text start="169.09" dur="4.41">unrepentant sin there are some pure</text>
  <text start="170.8" dur="6.87">hearts as well but there&amp;#39;s people in sin</text>
  <text start="173.5" dur="6.209">so based off first Timothy 1:20 and my</text>
  <text start="177.67" dur="4.74">position as an apostle by the authority</text>
  <text start="179.709" dur="4.801">of Yahshua HaMashiach a by his blood and</text>
