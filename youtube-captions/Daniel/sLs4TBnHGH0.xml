  <text start="83.46" dur="3.21">know how exactly is gonna work with this</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="3.18">one but I&amp;#39;ve been trying to bring people</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="5.37">together so that people who love</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="5.309">President Trump who love Q who are at</text>
  <text start="92.04" dur="3.02">least marginally aware of what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="93.479" dur="3.661">on with the child sex trafficking</text>
  <text start="95.06" dur="4.69">Britney still together so they can form</text>
  <text start="97.14" dur="4.799">their own prayer groups because I have a</text>
  <text start="99.75" dur="5.64">pro group that I meet every single night</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="4.68">I use a program called zoom and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="105.39" dur="3.45">been doing this now for about a year and</text>
  <text start="106.619" dur="3.481">a half and I kept having subscribers</text>
  <text start="108.84" dur="3.63">saying oh we want to join me want to</text>
  <text start="110.1" dur="5.82">join and I didn&amp;#39;t want anyone else in</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="5.189">because the people I knew I knew I</text>
  <text start="115.92" dur="2.909">either do in person or they didn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="4.5">in my prayer group for months and months</text>
  <text start="118.829" dur="4.301">and months and I just didn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="122.159" dur="5.53">ability to continue</text>
  <text start="123.13" dur="9.72">that people or what not okay thank you</text>
  <text start="127.689" dur="7.111">yeah copy for you guys and so and so I</text>
  <text start="132.85" dur="3.389">was praying about it and I felt like the</text>
  <text start="134.8" dur="3.84">Lord had told me he said well why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="136.239" dur="4.021">you start going out and and having these</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="3.48">conferences to bring people together and</text>
  <text start="140.26" dur="3.63">so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve been doing I</text>
  <text start="142.12" dur="3.81">started off with one in Seattle and</text>
  <text start="143.89" dur="4.41">there was about 26 people who showed up</text>
  <text start="145.93" dur="4.32">and of those 26 people about 19 of them</text>
  <text start="148.3" dur="3.12">wanted to connect they wanted to get</text>
  <text start="150.25" dur="3.12">together and they&amp;#39;ve actually they</text>
  <text start="151.42" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;ve had their sort of spread out</text>
  <text start="153.37" dur="4.949">across the Seattle area so they&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="155.05" dur="5.64">zoomer and prayer groups but like the</text>
  <text start="158.319" dur="3.811">one in Albuquerque they decided no we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="160.69" dur="3.39">gonna meet in person so they they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="162.13" dur="3.81">been meeting in person so there&amp;#39;s been I</text>
  <text start="164.08" dur="3.659">think about seven of the thirty that</text>
  <text start="165.94" dur="3.12">that initially made up that wanted to</text>
  <text start="167.739" dur="2.761">meet up and make a meeting in person</text>
  <text start="169.06" dur="3.72">just praying with each other and things</text>
  <text start="170.5" dur="5.489">like that and so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="172.78" dur="5.91">happening so that&amp;#39;s kind of that was</text>
  <text start="175.989" dur="5.011">kind of the vision of what I wanted to</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="4.56">do but it&amp;#39;s kind of turned into also</text>
  <text start="181" dur="3.72">just us discussing a bunch of different</text>
  <text start="183.25" dur="3.569">things I don&amp;#39;t know did you guys see the</text>
  <text start="184.72" dur="4.67">videos from my new jersey one that I had</text>
  <text start="186.819" dur="2.571">a couple</text>
  <text start="192.25" dur="5.13">well that was Williamsburg that was</text>
  <text start="194.44" dur="5.15">Williamsburg so about a week or two ago</text>
  <text start="197.38" dur="5.81">I went out to New Jersey and I had one</text>
  <text start="199.59" dur="5.56">where I felt like a four parter and</text>
  <text start="203.19" dur="4.75">because I finally figured out how to get</text>
  <text start="205.15" dur="5.1">one memory on my phone and I recorded</text>
  <text start="207.94" dur="4.47">you know pretty large chunk of the five</text>
  <text start="210.25" dur="4.47">hour conference but it turns into just a</text>
  <text start="212.41" dur="4.29">lot of questions and answers and things</text>
  <text start="214.72" dur="3.21">like that which is which is fun it&amp;#39;s fun</text>
  <text start="216.7" dur="3.84">we just start talking about all these</text>
  <text start="217.93" dur="5.61">things and it just turns it a really fun</text>
  <text start="220.54" dur="6.87">fun evening just by way of introduction</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="6.39">though of how I got started on this so</text>
  <text start="227.41" dur="7.02">about a year and a half ago so about</text>
  <text start="229.93" dur="7.44">summer of 2018 there was a gentleman</text>
  <text start="234.43" dur="6.619">named Isaac Cappy and he unfortunately</text>
  <text start="237.37" dur="7.11">is dead now but he was a sort of a</text>
  <text start="241.049" dur="7.091">d-list actor like bit parts in Hollywood</text>
  <text start="244.48" dur="5.65">but he came out and he exposed Seth and</text>
  <text start="248.14" dur="6.22">Claire Greene who are a list actors</text>
  <text start="250.13" dur="6.42">as being pedophiles and he made a big</text>
  <text start="254.36" dur="4.11">deal out of it he was all I mean he was</text>
  <text start="256.55" dur="3.36">on Alex Jones who he had his own you</text>
  <text start="258.47" dur="4.32">know Twitter feed he was doing this and</text>
  <text start="259.91" dur="5.25">seven Clara Greene never disputed what</text>
  <text start="262.79" dur="4.44">he said they never sued him all that was</text>
  <text start="265.16" dur="3.84">happening was they would use different</text>
  <text start="267.23" dur="3.51">type of media outlets like TMZ to</text>
  <text start="269" dur="4.74">character assassinated is what they were</text>
  <text start="270.74" dur="5.07">doing so when I have the cap and start</text>
  <text start="273.74" dur="4.2">talking about this that is what sort of</text>
  <text start="275.81" dur="3.69">woke me up to a man a new Pettit there</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="4.41">was the problem pedophilia but I had no</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="4.59">idea it was as extensive as it was and</text>
  <text start="282.35" dur="5.4">so I started listening to him and then I</text>
  <text start="284.09" dur="6.54">listened to Fiona Barnett who was</text>
  <text start="287.75" dur="5.9">friends advisor Kathy and she is someone</text>

  <text start="296.09" dur="7.02">decades and she testifies to being</text>
  <text start="300.22" dur="4.72">involved with not just pedophilia but</text>

  <text start="349.16" dur="3.96">happened you know how she got trapped in</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="3.42">the Bohemian Grove I&amp;#39;ve actually never</text>
  <text start="353.12" dur="3">had an opportunity to interview her but</text>
  <text start="354.53" dur="5.55">I did interview a close friend of hers</text>
  <text start="356.12" dur="7.35">named David shirt and David shirt also</text>
  <text start="360.08" dur="6">has some really heavy-duty testimonies</text>
  <text start="363.47" dur="6.78">he was raped by you know Antonin Scalia</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="5.79">when he was a little boy and which was a</text>
  <text start="370.25" dur="3.39">shock for me because you know I was</text>
  <text start="371.87" dur="4.74">raised to believe that anton scalia was</text>
  <text start="373.64" dur="4.26">this great conservative hero but I did</text>
  <text start="376.61" dur="3.66">start scratching my head when I found</text>
  <text start="377.9" dur="4.29">out that Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader</text>
  <text start="380.27" dur="3.99">Ginsburg were very close buddies they</text>
  <text start="382.19" dur="4.76">would hang out all the time and Ruth</text>
  <text start="384.26" dur="4.59">Bader Ginsburg she has advocated that</text>
  <text start="386.95" dur="4.029">eleven-year-olds should be able to have</text>
  <text start="388.85" dur="4.319">sex with adults that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the type</text>
  <text start="390.979" dur="3.541">of person that she was I believe I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="393.169" dur="3.541">think she&amp;#39;s gonna live anymore but</text>
  <text start="394.52" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s the type of person that she she</text>
  <text start="396.71" dur="5.61">she was back in the nineteen seventies</text>
  <text start="399.08" dur="6.149">she worked his extensive papers on her</text>
  <text start="402.32" dur="7.14">belief that 11 girls should be able to</text>
  <text start="405.229" dur="6.121">have sex with adults so through all of</text>
  <text start="409.46" dur="4.26">this I began to realize it wasn&amp;#39;t like a</text>
  <text start="411.35" dur="4.41">conservative versus liberal thing or a</text>
  <text start="413.72" dur="4.74">Republican versus Democrat this satanic</text>
  <text start="415.76" dur="5.28">pedophilia is systemic through many many</text>
  <text start="418.46" dur="4.92">different political classes there many</text>
  <text start="421.04" dur="5.67">different people Hollywood elites DC</text>
  <text start="423.38" dur="6.78">politicians CEOs the list goes on and on</text>
  <text start="426.71" dur="5.519">and on and the reason why I hate</text>
  <text start="430.16" dur="6.629">President Trump so much is because back</text>
  <text start="432.229" dur="7.921">in October of 2012 President Trump</text>
  <text start="436.789" dur="5.19">tweeted out that all pedophiles should</text>
  <text start="440.15" dur="7.8">receive swift justice and quick death</text>
  <text start="441.979" dur="8.851">and wonder why he did that how did he do</text>
  <text start="447.95" dur="4.77">that and he knows all about this stuff</text>
  <text start="450.83" dur="3.3">he&amp;#39;s because he&amp;#39;s brushed up against</text>
  <text start="452.72" dur="5.64">these people and he knows the sick</text>
  <text start="454.13" dur="7.23">things that&amp;#39;s been going on and so this</text>
  <text start="458.36" dur="6">is why the media this is why the</text>
  <text start="461.36" dur="5.58">Hollywood elites this is why the DC</text>
  <text start="464.36" dur="4.47">cabal is why everyone is so against and</text>
  <text start="466.94" dur="3.539">why even you&amp;#39;ll see RINO Republicans</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="3.959">against them it has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="470.479" dur="3.631">politics it has to do with satanic</text>
  <text start="472.789" dur="3.781">pedophilia with child sex trafficking</text>
  <text start="474.11" dur="5.76">and the rings that a lot of these people</text>
  <text start="476.57" dur="5.7">are involved in so about a year and a</text>
  <text start="479.87" dur="3.66">half ago I just you know the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="482.27" dur="3.09">told me said I want you to start using</text>

  <text start="500.67" dur="6.48">idea what kind of fervent passion there</text>

  <text start="591.57" dur="4.83">time and and her husband was sort of</text>
  <text start="593.91" dur="4.29">standing to the back and he sort of</text>
  <text start="596.4" dur="5.25">looked sort of almost shamefaced about</text>
  <text start="598.2" dur="5.91">what his wife was doing but yeah that</text>
  <text start="601.65" dur="4.16">was that that that does not happen</text>
  <text start="604.11" dur="3.649">before or since but</text>
  <text start="605.81" dur="3.449">I don&amp;#39;t know what I guess I probably</text>
  <text start="607.759" dur="3.33">just would have grabbed my camera and</text>
  <text start="609.259" dur="5.541">walked off but you said something like</text>
  <text start="611.089" dur="3.711">we have somebody that wants to speak</text>
  <text start="615.97" dur="4.09">well I wanted to see how long she could</text>
  <text start="618.29" dur="3.359">go right and what I thought was</text>
  <text start="620.06" dur="3.149">interesting is maybe about 30 or 45</text>

  <text start="635.24" dur="2.49">have much they don&amp;#39;t have substance</text>

  <text start="926.81" dur="4.69">basically they were they were trying to</text>

  <text start="943.92" dur="4.8">McConnell it&amp;#39;s still McConnell about</text>
  <text start="946.86" dur="3.9">three or four months ago befriended</text>
  <text start="948.72" dur="4.59">Timothy Holmes eV and he too started</text>
  <text start="950.76" dur="3.87">talking loudly about Broward County</text>
  <text start="953.31" dur="4.95">Florida and the stuff that was going on</text>
  <text start="954.63" dur="5.579">there and so I forget when the date was</text>
  <text start="958.26" dur="4.56">but a few months ago the sheriff came to</text>
  <text start="960.209" dur="5.521">his door and served him the same</text>
  <text start="962.82" dur="5.22">domestic violence restraining order that</text>

  <text start="968.04" dur="3.57">saying you cannot talk about ham hips</text>
  <text start="969.48" dur="4.2">going on Broward County lalalalala or</text>
  <text start="971.61" dur="3.78">you&amp;#39;re gonna rest well Phil McConnell</text>
  <text start="973.68" dur="4.349">said to heck with this I&amp;#39;m gonna use my</text>
  <text start="975.39" dur="4.83">first event rights and then of course a</text>
  <text start="978.029" dur="4.441">few weeks later they put him in jail</text>
  <text start="980.22" dur="4.2">because of that where&amp;#39;s he now stealing</text>
  <text start="982.47" dur="4.42">so he&amp;#39;s as far as I know he&amp;#39;s still in</text>
  <text start="984.42" dur="4.57">in Pierce County</text>
  <text start="986.89" dur="3.75">with Wisconsin which is basically plumb</text>
  <text start="988.99" dur="3.81">City which is where he lives he&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="990.64" dur="3.57">city jail there but he&amp;#39;s supposed to be</text>
  <text start="992.8" dur="4.11">released I think any day now because</text>
  <text start="994.21" dur="5.28">basically what&amp;#39;s happened is they were</text>
  <text start="996.91" dur="4.5">gonna extradite him to Florida but</text>
  <text start="999.49" dur="3.48">there&amp;#39;s a law in Wisconsin that says</text>
  <text start="1001.41" dur="3.84">that Florida does not extradite him</text>
  <text start="1002.97" dur="4.26">within I think it&amp;#39;s 45 days of his</text>
  <text start="1005.25" dur="4.32">arrest they have to release him well we</text>
  <text start="1007.23" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t think the governor of Florida is</text>
  <text start="1009.57" dur="5.34">going to issue that extradition</text>
  <text start="1011.58" dur="5.52">so because presumably the the governor</text>
  <text start="1014.91" dur="4.71">Florida is on our side he&amp;#39;s very Pro</text>
  <text start="1017.1" dur="4.92">Trump so as long as that&amp;#39;s the case he</text>
  <text start="1019.62" dur="4.23">should be out of jail any time now they</text>
  <text start="1022.02" dur="3.33">did he was doing these broadcasts using</text>
  <text start="1023.85" dur="3.45">the jail phone and then they put him</text>
  <text start="1025.35" dur="3.63">into solitary confinement for I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="1027.3" dur="3.36">wonder lineThe what happened</text>
  <text start="1028.98" dur="4.43">Kirk Pendergrass wasn&amp;#39;t too specific</text>
  <text start="1030.66" dur="5.67">about it but somehow they said that he</text>
  <text start="1033.41" dur="4.72">violated the order was on the phone and</text>
  <text start="1036.33" dur="4.08">he&amp;#39;s I think he&amp;#39;s out of that that</text>
  <text start="1038.13" dur="5.31">confinement now he&amp;#39;s giving you know his</text>
  <text start="1040.41" dur="5.21">speeches again on the phone but yeah he</text>
  <text start="1043.44" dur="5.37">should be out he should be on pretty</text>
  <text start="1045.62" dur="6.03">well that&amp;#39;s why I only say KP I won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1048.81" dur="7.02">say her name I won&amp;#39;t say her full name</text>
  <text start="1051.65" dur="5.56">and even now I won&amp;#39;t even often say that</text>
  <text start="1055.83" dur="2.97">I&amp;#39;ll just talk about Broward County</text>
  <text start="1057.21" dur="5.34">Florida because it&amp;#39;s not worth it I</text>
  <text start="1058.8" dur="5.55">talked to a friend of Timothy&amp;#39;s and Phil</text>

  <text start="1169.43" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s why you should watch that</text>
  <text start="1170.15" dur="7.32">interview with Kirk Pendergrass yeah</text>

  <text start="1179.29" dur="6.82">domestic violence itself the whole</text>
  <text start="1182.48" dur="5.52">domestic violence court is completely</text>
  <text start="1186.11" dur="4.29">wrong right it&amp;#39;s in the wrong because</text>
  <text start="1188" dur="4.16">yeah because technically domestic</text>
  <text start="1190.4" dur="5.64">violence is defined the Constitution as</text>
  <text start="1192.16" dur="6.16">people who are waging a illegal</text>
  <text start="1196.04" dur="4.62">insurrection within the balance know a</text>
  <text start="1198.32" dur="3.75">country that&amp;#39;s domestic value</text>

  <text start="1219.32" dur="3.96">so I actually asked her Pendergrass in</text>
  <text start="1221.18" dur="3.75">the interview I said so technically what</text>
  <text start="1223.28" dur="3.45">should have happened is KP should have</text>
  <text start="1224.93" dur="4.29">gone to Congress and gotten an</text>
  <text start="1226.73" dur="4.35">indictment against that&amp;#39;s how this ocean</text>

  <text start="1453.14" dur="4.89">then the day after July 4th what</text>
  <text start="1455.84" dur="5.82">happened was is that pence got in this</text>
  <text start="1458.03" dur="6.6">plane Air Force two and he started</text>
  <text start="1461.66" dur="6.21">flying to Indiana which is his home</text>
  <text start="1464.63" dur="6.12">state halfway to Indiana the plane</text>
  <text start="1467.87" dur="10.98">turned around and the call signs changed</text>
  <text start="1470.75" dur="11.57">from Air Force two to Sam 239 its First</text>
  <text start="1478.85" dur="3.47">Samuel 23 nine</text>

  <text start="1497.599" dur="4.66">and he said to a bee throw the</text>
  <text start="1499.649" dur="5.34">pre-spring head of the ephod so</text>
  <text start="1502.259" dur="5.85">President Trump calling pensa Saul</text>
  <text start="1504.989" dur="5.85">knowing that he was practicing mysticism</text>
  <text start="1508.109" dur="5.22">so those call science changed and what</text>
  <text start="1510.839" dur="4.32">that means is that either so if the vice</text>
  <text start="1513.329" dur="4.111">president&amp;#39;s on 8th Air Force 2 and the</text>
  <text start="1515.159" dur="4.5">callsign is change if it means he&amp;#39;s dead</text>
  <text start="1517.44" dur="4.169">and he&amp;#39;s not he&amp;#39;s still alive or his</text>
  <text start="1519.659" dur="4.62">power his authorities and stripped from</text>
  <text start="1521.609" dur="4.11">him now I don&amp;#39;t know how all that works</text>
  <text start="1524.279" dur="3.45">because obviously we still see pence</text>
  <text start="1525.719" dur="3.81">around right but from what I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1527.729" dur="3.63">able to gather he&amp;#39;s sort of like window</text>
  <text start="1529.529" dur="3.72">dressing at this point he&amp;#39;s being used</text>
  <text start="1531.359" dur="3.9">to consolidate the Christian</text>
  <text start="1533.249" dur="4.26">conservative vote because a lot of</text>
  <text start="1535.259" dur="4.17">people just aren&amp;#39;t aware of what pence</text>
  <text start="1537.509" dur="3.6">has been involved in but I have a</text>
  <text start="1539.429" dur="2.94">feeling that either just before the</text>
  <text start="1541.109" dur="2.97">elections or maybe just after the</text>
  <text start="1542.369" dur="4.831">elections we&amp;#39;re going to start you know</text>
  <text start="1544.079" dur="4.861">seeing justice done although what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1547.2" dur="6.799">interesting is I just read an article</text>

  <text start="1566.609" dur="4.41">on air and my advice is sort of awarded</text>
  <text start="1569.099" dur="3.45">the question and talked about something</text>
  <text start="1571.019" dur="4.32">else did you see that</text>
  <text start="1572.549" dur="4.68">yeah so I was like oh I just blown away</text>
  <text start="1575.339" dur="3.96">by that so I don&amp;#39;t know maybe something</text>
  <text start="1577.229" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s still gonna happen before before</text>
  <text start="1579.299" dur="5.22">the election but whenever I&amp;#39;ve asked my</text>
  <text start="1582.209" dur="4.08">Navy Intel source about Mike Pence he</text>
  <text start="1584.519" dur="4.65">just you won&amp;#39;t tell me much about that</text>

  <text start="1929.2" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1929.95" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s but again on the other hand you</text>
  <text start="1932.95" dur="4.08">shouldn&amp;#39;t be too surprised because if we</text>

  <text start="2235.59" dur="6.09">so initially was given to remind us to</text>
  <text start="2239.31" dur="4.35">keep the commandments and then in the</text>
  <text start="2241.68" dur="4.77">Psalms it talks about how there is</text>
  <text start="2243.66" dur="6.18">healing in his wings and these form like</text>
  <text start="2246.45" dur="4.95">wings around you and now if you go if</text>
  <text start="2249.84" dur="4.17">you skip to the New Testament the</text>
  <text start="2251.4" dur="3.96">Gospels the woman who had that issue of</text>
  <text start="2254.01" dur="3.87">blood for 12 years</text>
  <text start="2255.36" dur="4.74">it says she grabbed the hem of Jesus</text>
  <text start="2257.88" dur="3.81">garment because she knew the song I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2260.1" dur="3.81">about healing being in his wings she</text>
  <text start="2261.69" dur="5.55">believed he was God walking in the flesh</text>
  <text start="2263.91" dur="7.35">and so in faith he grabbed she grabbed</text>
  <text start="2267.24" dur="7.86">his easy and then she was healed she was</text>
  <text start="2271.26" dur="5.91">healed so I I wear these I think we</text>
  <text start="2275.1" dur="3.78">should all wear them actually I wear</text>
  <text start="2277.17" dur="5.94">these because Jesus was another test</text>
  <text start="2278.88" dur="5.94">t-shirt I made a little sort of a katana</text>
  <text start="2283.11" dur="4.43">here so basically all this is a white</text>
  <text start="2284.82" dur="6.23">t-shirt that I cut up on two sides</text>
  <text start="2287.54" dur="5.19">time to put on valve you can do all</text>
  <text start="2291.05" dur="3.45">sorts of creative things they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="2292.73" dur="3.24">have to look like this necessarily this</text>
  <text start="2294.5" dur="3.24">is the sort of the traditional Jewish</text>
  <text start="2295.97" dur="4.05">way of bringing they just the only</text>
  <text start="2297.74" dur="3.9">commandment is is that they&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="2300.02" dur="3.72">you know the fringes and that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2301.64" dur="3.15">blue they have a blue you know sort of</text>
  <text start="2303.74" dur="4.14">gluing them</text>
  <text start="2304.79" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;ve seen some with blue and gold blue</text>
  <text start="2307.88" dur="5.28">and red you know all sorts of different</text>
  <text start="2309.53" dur="6.72">designs and things like that but yeah</text>
  <text start="2313.16" dur="5.88">you know Jesus wore them and so I think</text>
  <text start="2316.25" dur="4.74">we should and that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re and maybe</text>
  <text start="2319.04" dur="3.54">they constantly provide me with</text>
  <text start="2320.99" dur="3.15">opportunities to witness so when I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="2322.58" dur="3.45">about before like what are those things</text>
  <text start="2324.14" dur="3.42">they just come up to me and say I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2326.03" dur="2.76">understand what that is and so I just</text>
  <text start="2327.56" dur="3.45">get an opportunity to say basically what</text>
  <text start="2328.79" dur="3.66">I just told you guys perfect which is</text>
  <text start="2331.01" dur="5.46">like one of the best witnessing tools</text>
  <text start="2332.45" dur="6.21">ever yeah so so yeah now I remember back</text>
  <text start="2336.47" dur="4.74">when you were gonna get married you were</text>
  <text start="2338.66" dur="4.73">not gonna wear rings right yeah what we</text>
  <text start="2341.21" dur="5.73">decided to do is we decided to exchange</text>
  <text start="2343.39" dur="5.8">ZT just because it&amp;#39;s a sign of a</text>
  <text start="2346.94" dur="3.66">covenant I didn&amp;#39;t want to do rings</text>
  <text start="2349.19" dur="4.23">because this is sort of a different</text>
  <text start="2350.6" dur="5.37">subject but rings are their pagan they</text>
  <text start="2353.42" dur="3.6">come from and I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not many</text>
  <text start="2355.97" dur="2.58">people who wear rings or anything like</text>
  <text start="2357.02" dur="3.09">that but I just thought that this was</text>
  <text start="2358.55" dur="3.45">going to be a more significant sign of</text>
  <text start="2360.11" dur="5.01">the Covenant so that&amp;#39;s why we exchanged</text>
  <text start="2362" dur="4.68">Zizi at the way the ceremony no that</text>
  <text start="2365.12" dur="2.18">totally makes sense I had no idea what</text>
  <text start="2366.68" dur="2.94">that was about</text>
  <text start="2367.3" dur="4.36">okay so Shabbat you&amp;#39;re all the time</text>
  <text start="2369.62" dur="3.99">talking about having Friday night off</text>
  <text start="2371.66" dur="4.65">and then you don&amp;#39;t really do a video</text>
  <text start="2373.61" dur="8.04">until late Saturday what except these up</text>
  <text start="2376.31" dur="10.82">at this time okay so it&amp;#39;s the seventh</text>
  <text start="2381.65" dur="8.43">day of the week days begin at night and</text>
  <text start="2387.13" dur="4.15">the reason for that is is in Genesis it</text>
  <text start="2390.08" dur="3.51">says there is evening and there was</text>
  <text start="2391.28" dur="3.93">morning.the first day there is evening</text>
  <text start="2393.59" dur="3.75">there was morning a second day so days</text>
  <text start="2395.21" dur="4.02">always begin when the Sun sets and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2397.34" dur="3.69">like that&amp;#39;s the beginning of another day</text>
  <text start="2399.23" dur="3.96">okay and the reason that is is because</text>
  <text start="2401.03" dur="4.05">and it&amp;#39;s funny because Q is kind of</text>
  <text start="2403.19" dur="4.74">capitalized on this dark to light right</text>
  <text start="2405.08" dur="5.25">the way God designs thing is that a day</text>
  <text start="2407.93" dur="4.62">begins at night and goes to the day so</text>
  <text start="2410.33" dur="3.87">it goes from dark to light right the way</text>
  <text start="2412.55" dur="2.53">Satan does things you start a bit not</text>
  <text start="2414.2" dur="4.07">you into</text>
  <text start="2415.08" dur="5.74">so so that&amp;#39;s how the days are calculated</text>
  <text start="2418.27" dur="5.76">so Sabbath the seventh day would begin</text>
  <text start="2420.82" dur="5.19">Friday sunset Friday night and go all</text>
  <text start="2424.03" dur="3.27">the way to Saturday night and this is</text>
  <text start="2426.01" dur="2.73">the seventh day the week it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="2427.3" dur="2.97">through Scripture I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2428.74" dur="2.85">literally thousands thousands of</text>
  <text start="2430.27" dur="3.6">scriptures on it but that many I guess</text>
  <text start="2431.59" dur="3.18">the major one is the one in the it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2433.87" dur="3.33">fourth commandment of the Ten</text>
  <text start="2434.77" dur="4.08">Commandments to keep this day holy it</text>
  <text start="2437.2" dur="2.88">says it&amp;#39;s the seventh day so it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2438.85" dur="3.96">mean you can just pick any day you want</text>
  <text start="2440.08" dur="6.6">this is the seventh day keep it holy and</text>
  <text start="2442.81" dur="5.34">sanctify it and my personal testimony is</text>
  <text start="2446.68" dur="4.08">you know I was just raised a</text>
  <text start="2448.15" dur="4.08">non-denominational Christian so I was</text>

  <text start="2522.21" dur="5.62">a lot of Christian worship music is in</text>
  <text start="2525.64" dur="5.01">major courts which is fine but all the</text>

  <text start="2546.529" dur="3.99">this never it just didn&amp;#39;t look like any</text>
  <text start="2548.45" dur="4.8">anything I&amp;#39;d seen in the Christian role</text>
  <text start="2550.519" dur="5.76">before and I just instantly felt oh my</text>
  <text start="2553.25" dur="7.89">gosh this I feel like I&amp;#39;m home I feel</text>
  <text start="2556.279" dur="6.75">like I&amp;#39;m home so I I started going to</text>
  <text start="2561.14" dur="4.29">this place and they had a guest speaker</text>
  <text start="2563.029" dur="4.56">the next week and basically he started</text>
  <text start="2565.43" dur="4.5">teaching from the New Testament about</text>
  <text start="2567.589" dur="4.651">how Jesus did not do a tutorial this</text>
  <text start="2569.93" dur="4.169">stuff was said that he walked in that he</text>
  <text start="2572.24" dur="4.74">taught that this stuff brings you closer</text>
  <text start="2574.099" dur="4.861">to him it&amp;#39;s not this huge burden that</text>
  <text start="2576.98" dur="4.589">were we&amp;#39;re sort of trained to believe</text>
  <text start="2578.96" dur="5.46">that somehow this Old Testament laws of</text>
  <text start="2581.569" dur="4.53">burden it&amp;#39;s horrible uh and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2584.42" dur="5.129">that way at all and so the first thing</text>
  <text start="2586.099" dur="6.151">that I started doing was keeping Sabbath</text>
  <text start="2589.549" dur="5.76">and you&amp;#39;re not supposed to work at all</text>

  <text start="2616.13" dur="5.28">other six days a week the whole idea of</text>
  <text start="2618.769" dur="4.381">the Sabbath is so it&amp;#39;s the seventh day</text>
  <text start="2621.41" dur="3.72">the week it&amp;#39;s looking forward to the</text>
  <text start="2623.15" dur="4.169">seventh millennium so we&amp;#39;ve been around</text>
  <text start="2625.13" dur="4.229">for about 6,000 years just like the six</text>
  <text start="2627.319" dur="4.171">working days and we&amp;#39;ve been under the</text>
  <text start="2629.359" dur="3.781">tyranny of sin and Satan and all the</text>
  <text start="2631.49" dur="4.379">stuff but there&amp;#39;s a Sabbath millennium</text>
  <text start="2633.14" dur="4.08">coming a thousand years of rest that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2635.869" dur="3.601">coming for this earth and has talked</text>
  <text start="2637.22" dur="4.379">about all through the scriptures and</text>
  <text start="2639.47" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s talked about in Revelation chapter</text>
  <text start="2641.599" dur="3.93">20 that it&amp;#39;s going to be a thousand</text>
  <text start="2643.46" dur="4.23">years and and so whenever we keep the</text>
  <text start="2645.529" dur="5.55">Sabbath day it&amp;#39;s looking forward to that</text>
  <text start="2647.69" dur="4.8">time when we&amp;#39;re gonna have this total</text>
  <text start="2651.079" dur="5.551">rest so it&amp;#39;s supposed to be a day of</text>
  <text start="2652.49" dur="5.7">delight of joy of you know feasting of</text>
  <text start="2656.63" dur="4.56">spending extra time with your friends</text>
  <text start="2658.19" dur="6.81">and your family you know things like</text>
  <text start="2661.19" dur="6.15">that not a time where you&amp;#39;re burning</text>
  <text start="2665" dur="4.02">yourself you know having to do all the</text>
  <text start="2667.34" dur="4.41">working busyness that would otherwise</text>
  <text start="2669.02" dur="3.84">and what I found is so this is what I</text>
  <text start="2671.75" dur="2.85">was trying to get to the very beginning</text>
  <text start="2672.86" dur="3.9">is so I was raised in on denominational</text>
  <text start="2674.6" dur="4.26">Sunday Christian so the way I would do</text>
  <text start="2676.76" dur="4.26">Sunday church is you go to you go to</text>
  <text start="2678.86" dur="4.38">church on Sunday and you spend a couple</text>
  <text start="2681.02" dur="3.93">hours there and then you go and you know</text>
  <text start="2683.24" dur="3.57">it was it wasn&amp;#39;t a Sabbath you might go</text>
  <text start="2684.95" dur="3.51">and work on your yard or do chores or</text>
  <text start="2686.81" dur="2.94">whatever or you might you know go out to</text>
  <text start="2688.46" dur="3.42">eat or whatever like that but it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2689.75" dur="4.74">really treated as a Sabbath so what I</text>
  <text start="2691.88" dur="5.19">understood is walking in this Sabbath</text>
  <text start="2694.49" dur="4.32">where you have an entire 24 hours from</text>
  <text start="2697.07" dur="3.24">Friday something Saturday sunset where</text>
  <text start="2698.81" dur="4.11">you put aside all the business of the</text>
  <text start="2700.31" dur="5.88">world and you&amp;#39;re just focused on</text>
  <text start="2702.92" dur="5.28">relaxing and enjoying and spending extra</text>
  <text start="2706.19" dur="5.78">time with your family or your spouse or</text>
  <text start="2708.2" dur="6.18">you know gathering with the Saints</text>
  <text start="2711.97" dur="5.2">hiking relaxing all this stuff</text>
  <text start="2714.38" dur="4.98">you&amp;#39;re so rejuvenating like it almost</text>
  <text start="2717.17" dur="5.87">makes your weekend way way way longer</text>
  <text start="2719.36" dur="6.87">and I and I found that my work from</text>
  <text start="2723.04" dur="5.5">Sunday through Friday those six days my</text>
  <text start="2726.23" dur="4.62">productivity just shot up because I</text>
  <text start="2728.54" dur="3.51">would take that day and there in and</text>
  <text start="2730.85" dur="3.3">there is and it&amp;#39;s almost something that</text>
  <text start="2732.05" dur="3.99">you just have to experience but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2734.15" dur="4.17">something special about that fright in</text>
  <text start="2736.04" dur="3.57">fact there&amp;#39;s a uh off to find the</text>
  <text start="2738.32" dur="3.84">documentation witness but I found a</text>
  <text start="2739.61" dur="6.12">scientific study where they showed that</text>
  <text start="2742.16" dur="6.09">humans have a deeper sleep pattern on</text>
  <text start="2745.73" dur="4.53">Friday nights than any other night of</text>
  <text start="2748.25" dur="4.17">the week yeah which I thought was like I</text>
  <text start="2750.26" dur="3.18">was amazing but any other night of the</text>
  <text start="2752.42" dur="3.27">week Friday nights that you have a</text>
