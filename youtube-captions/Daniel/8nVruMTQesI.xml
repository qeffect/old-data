  <text start="46.649" dur="3.811">can to explain what i believe you i was</text>
  <text start="48.989" dur="4.111">laying on my heart enough i&amp;#39;m an error</text>
  <text start="50.46" dur="4.349">in any way may yeah correct me and i can</text>
  <text start="53.1" dur="3.63">change but yahoo i just plead your blood</text>
  <text start="54.809" dur="3.84">over this video i pray for everybody</text>
  <text start="56.73" dur="3.18">watches this video that you would open</text>
  <text start="58.649" dur="3.39">up your their understanding and heart</text>
  <text start="59.91" dur="3.449">and give me the wisdom to speak when I</text>
  <text start="62.039" dur="6.9">believe you&amp;#39;re telling me to speak</text>
  <text start="63.359" dur="7.321">hallelujah okay so many may know or may</text>
  <text start="68.939" dur="4.621">not know my ministry I was utterly</text>
  <text start="70.68" dur="5.13">convinced that 2017 would be the year</text>
  <text start="73.56" dur="4.47">yosh would return of course I realized</text>
  <text start="75.81" dur="4.199">that that was not the case because 2014</text>
  <text start="78.03" dur="5.31">came and that three and a half year</text>
  <text start="80.009" dur="4.921">Great Tribulation did not begin and you</text>
  <text start="83.34" dur="3.99">know I had a publicly to repent and make</text>
  <text start="84.93" dur="5.07">things right and then I thought well</text>
  <text start="87.33" dur="4.77">maybe 2017 would be the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="90" dur="5.1">Great Tribulation and the reason why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="92.1" dur="4.879">so fixated on 2017 is I believe it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="95.1" dur="5.61">Jubilee I still believe that right now</text>
  <text start="96.979" dur="5.71">because 50 years prior was 1967 and</text>
  <text start="100.71" dur="4.049">that&amp;#39;s when the Jews we took back</text>
  <text start="102.689" dur="4.801">Jerusalem I have to take a step back a</text>
  <text start="104.759" dur="4.951">little bit why 50 years because if you</text>
  <text start="107.49" dur="4.919">go to Torah we find that there&amp;#39;s a cycle</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="4.56">of 49 years seven cycles of seven and</text>
  <text start="112.409" dur="3.841">then plus one is that 50th year the</text>
  <text start="114.27" dur="4.44">Jubilee year and it happens every 50</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="5.34">years in jubilee in this Jubilee cycle</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="4.83">and so 1967 would have been a jubilee</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="3.54">year with a Jews retook true so for the</text>
  <text start="123.54" dur="4.079">first time in nineteen hundred years and</text>
  <text start="125.13" dur="4.89">then 2017 would be that next to its</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="3.691">fifty years later and you go back even</text>
  <text start="130.02" dur="4.2">from nineteen</text>
  <text start="131.31" dur="4.95">c72 1917 that was an amazing year</text>
  <text start="134.22" dur="3.989">because I was the British Mandate the</text>
  <text start="136.26" dur="3.54">decoration of ball four where for the</text>
  <text start="138.209" dur="2.761">first time in hundreds and hundreds of</text>
  <text start="139.8" dur="3.96">years ever since the time of the</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="4.05">Crusades and little ages that portion of</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="3.42">the Middle East came into the hands of</text>
  <text start="145.02" dur="4.98">the west of the West the Western hand</text>
  <text start="147.18" dur="5.669">into Britain and was not in hands of the</text>
  <text start="150" dur="4.47">Arabs and the Muslims anymore at least</text>
  <text start="152.849" dur="4.17">that section of real estate that would</text>
  <text start="154.47" dur="6.87">eventually become again Israel which was</text>
  <text start="157.019" dur="8.22">Israel originally and so you look at all</text>
  <text start="161.34" dur="5.52">these years of the 1767 17 and 67 over</text>
  <text start="165.239" dur="3.06">the last twenty centuries and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.86" dur="3.659">going to see amazing events that occur</text>
  <text start="168.299" dur="4.02">on he&amp;#39;s Jubilee year and so you have to</text>
  <text start="170.519" dur="4.171">go even a step farther back because some</text>
  <text start="172.319" dur="3.691">of you may not know that and I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="174.69" dur="2.82">to post teachings about the school of my</text>
  <text start="176.01" dur="3.24">video I can&amp;#39;t really get into it too</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="4.259">deeply but you have to know about this</text>
  <text start="179.25" dur="4.29">in order for the TG to make sense people</text>
  <text start="181.769" dur="5.211">say well you know Yasha was crucified he</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="6.18">rose again in 28 or 29 or maybe 30 33</text>
  <text start="186.98" dur="5.35">and actually he was crucified and Rosie</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="6.18">Anand 17 ad which would sync up with</text>
  <text start="192.33" dur="6.689">Jubilee being on 2017 and 1967 and then</text>
  <text start="195.9" dur="6.99">set 1917 and so on so forth account back</text>
  <text start="199.019" dur="6.211">50 years increments in 1780 what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="202.89" dur="5.099">interesting about 17 ad is that it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="4.379">year in which there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="207.989" dur="3.84">recorded year in all of the first</text>
  <text start="209.609" dur="3.831">century other than very end of the first</text>
  <text start="211.829" dur="3.961">century where an earthquake occurs</text>
  <text start="213.44" dur="3.82">planning the historian Pliny who</text>
  <text start="215.79" dur="3.509">actually lived during the time of the</text>
  <text start="217.26" dur="4.289">first half of the first century records</text>
  <text start="219.299" dur="4.141">this huge incredible earthquake that</text>
  <text start="221.549" dur="4.171">occurs in the Middle East it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="223.44" dur="4.169">powerful it overthrows several cities in</text>
  <text start="225.72" dur="4.139">Asia Minor including sergeants which is</text>
  <text start="227.609" dur="4.051">mentioned in Revelation Asia miners of</text>
  <text start="229.859" dur="5.671">course a thousand miles north of</text>
  <text start="231.66" dur="5.549">Jerusalem so it was a huge shaking read</text>
  <text start="235.53" dur="3.39">the scriptures of course the gospel show</text>
  <text start="237.209" dur="3.301">that when Yahshua dive on a tree there</text>
  <text start="238.92" dur="3.689">was this violent shaking this earthquake</text>
  <text start="240.51" dur="5.19">in the Middle East so violent that it</text>
  <text start="242.609" dur="4.321">ripped the curtain and two in the temple</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="3">this is not just some curtain thats</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="5.46">hanging in your shower this is a</text>
  <text start="248.7" dur="5.34">of immense thick curtain and fact a hole</text>
  <text start="252.39" dur="5.4">opened up right next to Joshua&amp;#39;s he was</text>
  <text start="254.04" dur="5.069">hanging on that tree the graves open in</text>
  <text start="257.79" dur="3.509">Jerusalem it was a massive earthquake</text>
  <text start="259.109" dur="5.551">and we don&amp;#39;t see any record of that by</text>
  <text start="261.299" dur="4.801">any historian except planning benches it</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="3.96">and just see this much as it as well the</text>
  <text start="266.1" dur="3.84">planning inches it in detail in 1780s</text>
  <text start="268.62" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s the greatest earthquake that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.94" dur="3.87">ever hit but he&amp;#39;s able to wear of and</text>
  <text start="272.1" dur="3.93">all the history that have been recorded</text>
  <text start="273.81" dur="3.81">up until that point the only other</text>
  <text start="276.03" dur="4.38">earthquake recorded in the first century</text>
  <text start="277.62" dur="5.7">is Wade toward the end when not best</text>
  <text start="280.41" dur="5.069">food that su dias blows that volcano but</text>
  <text start="283.32" dur="5.19">the only time around any time around</text>

  <text start="295.94" dur="4.78">rule of Tiberius was miscalculated and</text>
  <text start="298.59" dur="5.1">you can see where 1780 really makes a</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="4.47">lot of sense of yahshua&amp;#39;s death burial</text>

  <text start="424.11" dur="4.229">things right to define lines to restore</text>
  <text start="426.689" dur="3.45">order and the temple of concord</text>
  <text start="428.339" dur="3.6">literally was used many times in its</text>
  <text start="430.139" dur="3.33">history for the Senate to meet when</text>

  <text start="463.919" dur="2.91">order if you look at the trump</text>
  <text start="465.089" dur="4.41">presidency if Trump wins this election</text>
  <text start="466.829" dur="4.32">which I believe you will he&amp;#39;s also his</text>
  <text start="469.499" dur="3.21">campaign is all about restoring order to</text>

  <text start="475.289" dur="5.49">restoring order and law and everything</text>
  <text start="477.289" dur="5.89">and in fact if you go back to the Torah</text>
  <text start="480.779" dur="3.6">about this 50-year Jubilee fig or</text>
  <text start="483.179" dur="4.47">something that&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="484.379" dur="4.62">that 49th year in the 50 years that 49th</text>
  <text start="487.649" dur="3.18">year just before the 50th you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.999" dur="4.08">supposed to blow a trumpet on Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="490.829" dur="3.86">which occurs in the fall of course we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="493.079" dur="4.49">in that 49th year right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="494.689" dur="4.71">in 2016 and a trumpets supposed to be</text>
  <text start="497.569" dur="3.81">blown on yom kippur to announce the</text>
  <text start="499.399" dur="3.36">Jubilee year and is it an interesting</text>
  <text start="501.379" dur="3.93">that we have a president Trump or</text>
  <text start="502.759" dur="5.52">potential president Trump who could win</text>
  <text start="505.309" dur="4.47">in a landslide victory against Hillary</text>
  <text start="508.279" dur="4.68">Clinton in the fall just a couple weeks</text>
  <text start="509.779" dur="5.01">after yom kippur this year or this year</text>
  <text start="512.959" dur="3.3">will fall in October just a couple of</text>
  <text start="514.789" dur="3.42">weeks later he could win in a landslide</text>
  <text start="516.259" dur="3.66">which would be like that Trump being</text>
  <text start="518.209" dur="5.341">blown yeah Telegraph into the world he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="519.919" dur="6.42">blowing this trunk so him that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="523.55" dur="4.05">very prophetic I think so we literally</text>
  <text start="526.339" dur="2.581">have a trump neat loan he wins the</text>
  <text start="527.6" dur="3.39">presidency and then of course he would</text>
  <text start="528.92" dur="4.169">begin his presidency just before the</text>
  <text start="530.99" dur="4.17">Jubilee year begins in the spring a</text>
  <text start="533.089" dur="4.831">Hebrew year goes from spring to spring a</text>
  <text start="535.16" dur="5.099">view to Aviv so that 49th year he&amp;#39;s</text>
