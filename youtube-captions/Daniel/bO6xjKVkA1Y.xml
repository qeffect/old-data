  <text start="0.319" dur="6.641">shabbat shalom it is Friday night</text>
  <text start="2.85" dur="6.18">September the 29th 2017 not just the</text>
  <text start="6.96" dur="5.07">shabbat shalom&amp;#39; but the high Shiva this</text>
  <text start="9.03" dur="5.88">is Yom Kippur the Day of Atonement the</text>
  <text start="12.03" dur="5.79">highest holy day on the entire calendar</text>
  <text start="14.91" dur="7.14">a day in which no food will touch our</text>
  <text start="17.82" dur="7.32">lips no water will we drink where we do</text>
  <text start="22.05" dur="5.489">not bathe we do not do anything we we it</text>
  <text start="25.14" dur="6.209">is a day of atonement it is the day when</text>
  <text start="27.539" dur="5.401">Yahshua our high priest goes into that</text>
  <text start="31.349" dur="5.791">Holy of Holies in the heavenly</text>
  <text start="32.94" dur="5.85">tabernacle and on this Day of Atonement</text>
  <text start="37.14" dur="5.4">Yom Kippur I didn&amp;#39;t think I was gonna</text>
  <text start="38.79" dur="6.749">make any video but yeah put up on my</text>
  <text start="42.54" dur="4.47">heart this teaching and and it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="45.539" dur="3.36">I&amp;#39;ve seen on Facebook and other places</text>
  <text start="47.01" dur="4.08">that there&amp;#39;s I think some confusion</text>
  <text start="48.899" dur="4.621">about when the resurrection happens and</text>
  <text start="51.09" dur="3.84">when the second return of Messiah</text>
  <text start="53.52" dur="2.82">happens and when the marriage supper of</text>
  <text start="54.93" dur="3.51">the Lamb happens and does it happen on</text>
  <text start="56.34" dur="4.019">heaven or on earth and and and when all</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="3.66">these things happen and how they fit</text>
  <text start="60.359" dur="4.05">into the template of the fall feasts</text>
  <text start="62.1" dur="4.41">because we know of course Yahshua has</text>
  <text start="64.409" dur="5.011">already fulfilled Passover unleavened</text>
  <text start="66.51" dur="5.31">bread firstfruits and Pentecost Shavuot</text>
  <text start="69.42" dur="5.43">he fulfilled those feasts we still keep</text>
  <text start="71.82" dur="4.65">them to look back on what he&amp;#39;s done but</text>
  <text start="74.85" dur="5.73">he&amp;#39;s fulfilled those those are those are</text>
  <text start="76.47" dur="6.63">done but yom teruah yom kippur which is</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="4.74">today the day of atonement and the feast</text>
  <text start="83.1" dur="4.05">of Sukkot including that last great day</text>
  <text start="85.32" dur="3.15">the eighth day that sort of tacked on to</text>
  <text start="87.15" dur="3.899">the end of the seven-day feast of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="88.47" dur="4.439">those feasts the fall feasts have not</text>
  <text start="91.049" dur="4.32">been fulfilled and so I want to go over</text>
  <text start="92.909" dur="4.741">real quickly what Yass put up on my</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="5.191">heart to clarify it some of this I</text>
  <text start="97.65" dur="6.539">learned many years ago when maca Rood</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="7.04">did teaching on on these things when he</text>
  <text start="104.189" dur="6.54">was under the anointing of course he</text>
  <text start="107.6" dur="6.37">he&amp;#39;s fallen into a lot of sin he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="110.729" dur="4.801">basically turned into someone who makes</text>
  <text start="113.97" dur="3.21">merchandise to the gospel and now he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="115.53" dur="5.07">clown I mean his Saturday Night Live</text>
  <text start="117.18" dur="6.329">thing&amp;#39;s a total farce but back in 2001</text>
  <text start="120.6" dur="4.26">man he had the anointing and and so some</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="3.54">of this comes from that but then some of</text>
  <text start="124.86" dur="5.459">this Yasir revealed to me even tonight</text>
  <text start="127.049" dur="4.891">as I&amp;#39;ve been entering into this fast day</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="3.361">yaws been showing me some things so</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;re gonna get right into it here</text>
  <text start="133.68" dur="3.809">so this first slide again this China</text>
  <text start="135.81" dur="3.39">just shows my whiteboard where as I was</text>
  <text start="137.489" dur="3.39">praying and as I&amp;#39;ve been fasting yah had</text>
  <text start="139.2" dur="3.509">me put all the stuff up I don&amp;#39;t expect</text>
  <text start="140.879" dur="2.97">you to decipher that but I just wanted</text>
  <text start="142.709" dur="2.61">to show you that that&amp;#39;s kind of the</text>
  <text start="143.849" dur="3.571">whole thing together and again I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="145.319" dur="7.67">take it piece by piece and make it much</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="10.2">more clear so this first slide is</text>
  <text start="152.989" dur="7.241">trumpets fully fulfilled so on some</text>

  <text start="198.989" dur="3.21">you&amp;#39;re gonna have the second woe and</text>
  <text start="200.91" dur="3.15">this great earthquake you&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>

  <text start="216.15" dur="4.47">some point between yom teruah and yom</text>
  <text start="217.919" dur="4.56">kippur during these days of all the days</text>
  <text start="220.62" dur="3.81">of the seventh trumpet and we get caught</text>
  <text start="222.479" dur="4.081">up to be with Yahshua in the air and and</text>
  <text start="224.43" dur="3.989">that&amp;#39;s and that is trumpets it is fully</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="4.2">fulfilled it&amp;#39;s completely and totally</text>
  <text start="228.419" dur="4.201">fulfilled just as Passover just as</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="3.719">unleavened bread and first fruits and</text>
  <text start="232.62" dur="3.39">Shadwell Pentecost and now trumpets will</text>
  <text start="234.479" dur="5.521">have been fully fulfilled at this</text>
  <text start="236.01" dur="6.089">resurrection and then after those ten</text>
  <text start="240" dur="3.299">days of all we come to UM Kippur and Yom</text>
  <text start="242.099" dur="3.871">Kippur is only gonna be partially</text>
  <text start="243.299" dur="5.55">fulfilled and I and we&amp;#39;re gonna explain</text>
  <text start="245.97" dur="3.689">why and and Sukkot and the last great</text>
  <text start="248.849" dur="3.901">day are only gonna be partially</text>
  <text start="249.659" dur="4.621">fulfilled because Yom Kippur and Secotan</text>
  <text start="252.75" dur="3.78">the last great day those are going to be</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="5.25">fully fulfilled at a later time but at</text>
  <text start="256.53" dur="8.189">this period at this point in what I</text>
  <text start="259.53" dur="6.9">think will be the year 2027 although</text>
  <text start="264.719" dur="2.821">trumpets yom teruah will be fully</text>
  <text start="266.43" dur="5.37">fulfilled</text>
  <text start="267.54" dur="5.16">the yom kippur and the feasts of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="2.1">the last great day will only be</text>
  <text start="272.7" dur="4.47">partially fulfilled so let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="4.86">this so Yom Kippur after this</text>
  <text start="277.17" dur="3.87">resurrections happen it&amp;#39;s partially</text>
  <text start="278.76" dur="4.14">fulfilled because now we&amp;#39;re caught up to</text>
  <text start="281.04" dur="3.39">be with yash from the clouds and where</text>
  <text start="282.9" dur="4.32">does he take us we&amp;#39;ll go to Revelation</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="5.55">chapter 15 right in those few for a few</text>
  <text start="287.22" dur="5.43">first few verses of that chapter you see</text>
  <text start="289.98" dur="5.49">that all the dead of Messiah all the</text>
  <text start="292.65" dur="4.83">both the those under you know in the in</text>
  <text start="295.47" dur="4.02">the days of Moses and the days of the</text>
  <text start="297.48" dur="3.9">lamb I&amp;#39;ll ever II seen in other words</text>
  <text start="299.49" dur="3.51">from Genesis revelation they are now</text>
  <text start="301.38" dur="3.96">standing on the sea of fire and glass</text>
  <text start="303" dur="4.17">and this is where the Saints get the</text>
  <text start="305.34" dur="3.3">rewards Paul makes reference to this in</text>
  <text start="307.17" dur="3.24">a second letter to the Corinthians where</text>
  <text start="308.64" dur="3.15">you know if we have hay wooden stubble</text>
  <text start="310.41" dur="3.15">that&amp;#39;ll get burned up but anything that</text>
  <text start="311.79" dur="4.02">really was on the foundation of yahshua</text>
  <text start="313.56" dur="4.5">that we did righteous acts those are</text>
  <text start="315.81" dur="4.11">gold silver and and and get refined by</text>
  <text start="318.06" dur="3.45">the fire so we get our rewards and that</text>
  <text start="319.92" dur="3.24">is the day of atonement that happens on</text>
  <text start="321.51" dur="3.39">the day of atonement that year and and</text>
  <text start="323.16" dur="3.39">we&amp;#39;re up in the heavens with him on that</text>
  <text start="324.9" dur="3.12">sea of fire and glass and we get our</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="3.78">rewards as we&amp;#39;re in our new bodies</text>
  <text start="328.02" dur="5.37">already and down on earth you have the</text>
  <text start="330.33" dur="5.28">seven plagues being poured out upon the</text>
  <text start="333.39" dur="4.41">earth the wrath of yah and and these</text>
  <text start="335.61" dur="4.92">seven plagues are so horrible I mean two</text>
  <text start="337.8" dur="4.59">of them turn every single piece of water</text>
  <text start="340.53" dur="4.02">whether it&amp;#39;s ocean or streams into blood</text>
  <text start="342.39" dur="3.57">well people can&amp;#39;t survive that long in</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="3.06">that condition so I think all these</text>
  <text start="345.96" dur="4.35">seven plagues are actually thrown down</text>
  <text start="347.61" dur="4.02">together on David helmet even as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.31" dur="3.03">getting our rewards up in the heavenlies</text>
  <text start="351.63" dur="3.24">so there&amp;#39;s an atonement being done in</text>
  <text start="353.34" dur="3.57">the heavenlies where the Saints are</text>
  <text start="354.87" dur="3.9">getting their rewards from Yahshua the</text>
  <text start="356.91" dur="3.36">judgment seat of Messiah and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.77" dur="2.97">atonement being done on earth as these</text>
  <text start="360.27" dur="4.49">seven plagues the wrath of yah gets</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="7.11">poured upon the wicked so Yom Kippur is</text>
  <text start="364.76" dur="6.46">partially fulfilled and then of course</text>
  <text start="368.85" dur="4.83">if you look at the feast days Leviticus</text>
  <text start="371.22" dur="5.04">23 there&amp;#39;s now just as there&amp;#39;s ten days</text>
  <text start="373.68" dur="5.07">between trumpets and Yom Kippur there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.26" dur="5.67">now a five-day gap between Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="378.75" dur="5.49">and when Sukkot begins and during those</text>
  <text start="381.93" dur="4.26">five days you see what happens next in</text>
  <text start="384.24" dur="2.97">Revelation the armies of the beasts are</text>
  <text start="386.19" dur="3.24">gathered together</text>
  <text start="387.21" dur="4.89">okay those unclean spirits the three</text>
  <text start="389.43" dur="4.62">frog-like unclean spirits gather all the</text>
  <text start="392.1" dur="3.3">armies of the beasts to prepare because</text>
  <text start="394.05" dur="2.91">they know now the Lambs coming but they</text>
  <text start="395.4" dur="4.17">think they can actually defeat the lamb</text>
  <text start="396.96" dur="3.929">and so they&amp;#39;re being gathered during</text>
  <text start="399.57" dur="2.909">those five days</text>
  <text start="400.889" dur="4.441">and then so then we come to the next</text>
  <text start="402.479" dur="5.761">slide on the next slide now we have</text>
  <text start="405.33" dur="5.04">Ciccone and so Cote is seven days within</text>
  <text start="408.24" dur="3.81">an eight last great day tacked on at the</text>
  <text start="410.37" dur="4.71">end but it&amp;#39;s a seven day wedding feast</text>

  <text start="416.55" dur="3.6">and we are still in heaven so we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="418.59" dur="3.569">in heaven since those days of the</text>
  <text start="420.15" dur="4.259">seventh Trump you know sometime between</text>
  <text start="422.159" dur="4.38">yom teruah and yom kippur we get caught</text>
  <text start="424.409" dur="3.69">up to be with Yahshua and we&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="426.539" dur="3.96">having this whole time and during Yom</text>
  <text start="428.099" dur="4.41">Kippur we get these rewards on the sea</text>
  <text start="430.499" dur="3.45">of fire and glass and now we&amp;#39;ve entered</text>
  <text start="432.509" dur="3.87">into the marriage supper of the Lamb and</text>
  <text start="433.949" dur="5.25">this is where another partially</text>
  <text start="436.379" dur="4.621">fulfilled Secotan happens during this</text>
  <text start="439.199" dur="3.12">marriage supper of the lamb that all</text>

  <text start="454.469" dur="5.491">still sort of gathering and then we come</text>
  <text start="457.71" dur="4.62">to the last great day that eighth day</text>
  <text start="459.96" dur="3.929">okay this is the day where Yahshua cry</text>

  <text start="533.19" dur="2.65">trumpet</text>
  <text start="533.83" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;ll be just like in the same case as</text>
  <text start="535.84" dur="4.44">Passover unleavened bread firstfruits</text>
  <text start="538.09" dur="4.61">and Chadwick Pentecost it will be now a</text>
  <text start="540.28" dur="4.62">fulfilled a fully fulfilled feast</text>
  <text start="542.7" dur="3.97">however if you keep on reading in</text>
  <text start="544.9" dur="3.93">Revelation 20 to find out what events</text>
  <text start="546.67" dur="4.35">happen after Yahshua returns with us on</text>
  <text start="548.83" dur="4.02">that last great day you now have a</text>
  <text start="551.02" dur="5.58">thousand years in which Satan is bound</text>
  <text start="552.85" dur="5.21">in in the great abyss and the pit which</text>
  <text start="556.6" dur="4.92">I think is the center of the earth and</text>
  <text start="558.06" dur="4.69">we we who are resurrected we who made</text>
  <text start="561.52" dur="4.14">the first resurrection we are now going</text>
  <text start="562.75" dur="4.56">to rule and reign with Messiah over the</text>
  <text start="565.66" dur="3.3">nations of the earth that survived the</text>
  <text start="567.31" dur="4.89">Great Tribulation and this happens for a</text>
  <text start="568.96" dur="5.34">thousand years now there are ten sets of</text>
  <text start="572.2" dur="4.74">100 years and that makes up a thousand</text>
  <text start="574.3" dur="4.74">years just like there are 10 days of all</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="4.68">between Feast of Trumpets and yom teruah</text>
  <text start="579.04" dur="4.35">and the reason why there&amp;#39;s this thousand</text>
  <text start="581.62" dur="3.03">years is because now here during this</text>
  <text start="583.39" dur="3.75">thousand years this is when the ten days</text>
  <text start="584.65" dur="6.33">of all are fully fulfilled okay</text>
  <text start="587.14" dur="5.91">and once we get once we get through that</text>
  <text start="590.98" dur="3.54">thousand-year reign at some point we</text>
  <text start="593.05" dur="3.06">don&amp;#39;t know the exact day or the hour but</text>
  <text start="594.52" dur="3.06">at some point after that thousand-year</text>
  <text start="596.11" dur="4.23">reign is over</text>
  <text start="597.58" dur="5.13">Satan is released for a last rebellion</text>
  <text start="600.34" dur="4.95">because there have been billions and</text>
  <text start="602.71" dur="5.61">trillions of people born and living on</text>
  <text start="605.29" dur="4.95">this beautiful earth and many of them</text>
  <text start="608.32" dur="4.5">haven&amp;#39;t been tested because there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="610.24" dur="4.02">no Devils to tempt them Yahshua has been</text>
  <text start="612.82" dur="3.21">ruling and reigning the Torah has been</text>
  <text start="614.26" dur="3.36">going forth from Zion and so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616.03" dur="2.79">been no real test for a lot of people</text>
  <text start="617.62" dur="3.39">that were born during this time and so</text>
  <text start="618.82" dur="4.5">now a test will come and Satan is</text>
  <text start="621.01" dur="5.58">released and he he deceives quite a few</text>
  <text start="623.32" dur="4.71">but this is the last rebellion and of</text>
  <text start="626.59" dur="3.18">course this doesn&amp;#39;t last long at all you</text>
  <text start="628.03" dur="4.23">read the fire comes down from yon and</text>
  <text start="629.77" dur="4.5">destroys Satan and as his rebellious</text>
  <text start="632.26" dur="5.58">army and the heavens and earth basically</text>
  <text start="634.27" dur="5.58">flee from this from yaws face as he sits</text>
  <text start="637.84" dur="3.6">on the great white throne judgment now</text>
  <text start="639.85" dur="3.42">this great white throne judgment known</text>
  <text start="641.44" dur="3.6">as the second death this is where all</text>
  <text start="643.27" dur="3.33">the wicked people are resurrected they</text>
  <text start="645.04" dur="3.36">get new bodies just like we did back in</text>
  <text start="646.6" dur="4.05">the first resurrection a thousand years</text>
  <text start="648.4" dur="3.69">earlier they also get new bodies but</text>
  <text start="650.65" dur="4.17">they get thrown into the lake of fire</text>
  <text start="652.09" dur="4.32">along where where the beast and false</text>
  <text start="654.82" dur="4.71">prophet have been burning for a thousand</text>
  <text start="656.41" dur="5.31">years since Yahshua&amp;#39;s second return so</text>
  <text start="659.53" dur="4.98">this great white throne judgment is the</text>
  <text start="661.72" dur="5.339">yom kippur fully fulfilled this is when</text>

  <text start="678.159" dur="4.11">was born and died during the lineal</text>
  <text start="680.079" dur="4.98">reign that did place their trust in</text>
  <text start="682.269" dur="4.26">Yahshua and died in that state they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="685.059" dur="2.85">also be resurrected at this point and</text>

  <text start="707.169" dur="3.75">when he said in Matthew five not one jot</text>
  <text start="709.599" dur="2.79">or tittle from the Torah would pass</text>

  <text start="748.179" dur="5.64">fully fulfilled now it&amp;#39;s fully fulfilled</text>
  <text start="751.989" dur="3.06">just as yom kippur was fully fulfilled</text>
  <text start="753.819" dur="3.45">at the great white throne judgment and</text>
  <text start="755.049" dur="4.41">just as peace of trumpets was fully</text>

  <text start="785.319" dur="4.29">when Yahshua said on the last great day</text>
  <text start="787.089" dur="4.95">of Sukkot the scope before he was</text>
  <text start="789.609" dur="3.81">crucified where he said living waters</text>
  <text start="792.039" dur="3.12">would come from his belly and flow</text>
  <text start="793.419" dur="5.19">through anyone that would thirst for him</text>
  <text start="795.159" dur="5.01">so now that the last great day in this</text>

  <text start="811.55" dur="4.2">will be fully fulfilled at some YUM tour</text>
  <text start="814.16" dur="3.51">in the future where when we get caught</text>
  <text start="815.75" dur="3.87">up the dead Messiah rise the two</text>
  <text start="817.67" dur="3.72">witnesses rise and we who are alive and</text>
  <text start="819.62" dur="3.209">remain get caught up to be with him but</text>
  <text start="821.39" dur="3.509">you only have a partial fulfillment of</text>
  <text start="822.829" dur="4.651">Yom Kippur and Sukkot and last great day</text>
  <text start="824.899" dur="5.281">that year that trumpets get fully</text>
  <text start="827.48" dur="4.88">fulfilled then you got a thousand years</text>
  <text start="830.18" dur="4.349">to fulfill that date those days of awe</text>
  <text start="832.36" dur="4.93">between trumpets and Yom Kippur and</text>
  <text start="834.529" dur="4.771">after the thousand-year reign and after</text>
  <text start="837.29" dur="3.18">Satan&amp;#39;s rebellion and after the great</text>
  <text start="839.3" dur="2.76">and during the great white throne</text>
  <text start="840.47" dur="4.41">judgment then you have Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="842.06" dur="3.81">finally fully fulfilled and then you</text>
  <text start="844.88" dur="3.3">have the new heavens new earth where</text>
  <text start="845.87" dur="3.57">suit coats fully fulfilled and you have</text>
  <text start="848.18" dur="2.58">the water just the living water is</text>
  <text start="849.44" dur="2.94">gushing out from the throne of the Lamb</text>
  <text start="850.76" dur="3.96">for the healing the nations where the</text>
  <text start="852.38" dur="4.079">last great day is fully fulfilled so</text>
  <text start="854.72" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s a gap of a thousand years</text>
  <text start="856.459" dur="5.551">between where trumpets is fully</text>
  <text start="858.44" dur="5.48">fulfilled and then Yom Kippur and Sukkot</text>
  <text start="862.01" dur="4.769">and last great day are fully fulfilled</text>
  <text start="863.92" dur="5.08">however even in the year of Yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="866.779" dur="4.531">return when trumpets is fully fulfilled</text>
  <text start="869" dur="4.949">we&amp;#39;ll see a partial fulfillment of Yom</text>
  <text start="871.31" dur="5.55">Kippur Sukkot and a last great day</text>
  <text start="873.949" dur="4.801">by the things that I showed here you</text>
  <text start="876.86" dur="4.53">know the sea of fire and glass the the</text>
  <text start="878.75" dur="4.62">judges being poured out the merits of</text>
  <text start="881.39" dur="3.99">the lam yasha has returned all of those</text>
  <text start="883.37" dur="4.11">remaining feast days will be partially</text>
  <text start="885.38" dur="4.44">fulfilled but they won&amp;#39;t find their full</text>
  <text start="887.48" dur="3.9">fulfillment until a thousand years later</text>
  <text start="889.82" dur="3.15">when you have the great white throne</text>
  <text start="891.38" dur="3.36">judgment and the new heavens and new</text>
  <text start="892.97" dur="3.72">earth and that those living water is</text>
  <text start="894.74" dur="3.24">gushing out from the front of the lamb</text>
  <text start="896.69" dur="3.87">for the healing of the nations and of</text>
  <text start="897.98" dur="4.56">course the leaves that are produced</text>
  <text start="900.56" dur="2.88">every month from The Tree of Life for</text>
  <text start="902.54" dur="3.95">the healing of the nation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="903.44" dur="5.639">so so I hope this makes this very clear</text>
  <text start="906.49" dur="3.849">when these feasts are fully fulfilled</text>
  <text start="909.079" dur="2.88">when they&amp;#39;re partially fulfilled when</text>
  <text start="910.339" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re fully veiled what events happen</text>
  <text start="911.959" dur="4.981">in heaven what events happen in earth</text>

  <text start="949.699" dur="4.17">remarking that every great revival</text>
  <text start="951.259" dur="3.99">starts with a return to yon he made this</text>
  <text start="953.869" dur="3.06">statement sort of off the cuff but he</text>
  <text start="955.249" dur="3.661">made a statement where he said you know</text>
  <text start="956.929" dur="3.6">if any day a revival would break out in</text>
  <text start="958.91" dur="4.199">his people it would be on Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="960.529" dur="5.31">when we&amp;#39;re all fasting and and rending</text>
  <text start="963.109" dur="4.92">our hearts before yeah and and so I just</text>
  <text start="965.839" dur="4.56">thought wow maybe maybe this Yom Kippur</text>
