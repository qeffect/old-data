  <text start="125.78" dur="6.3">make it very clear when I expose an</text>
  <text start="128.33" dur="5.61">individual like Angelo and like Alicia</text>
  <text start="132.08" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s because they already have</text>
  <text start="133.94" dur="4.71">ministries where they&amp;#39;re affecting a lot</text>
  <text start="135.41" dur="5.49">of people and because I love the people</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="5.16">that they&amp;#39;re affecting if I if yah shows</text>
  <text start="140.9" dur="6.54">to me that Angelo and Alicia are in sin</text>
  <text start="143.81" dur="6.63">I have to expose them because y&amp;#39;all put</text>
  <text start="147.44" dur="5.22">them in my life I would be very unloving</text>
  <text start="150.44" dur="5.549">if I let Angela just continue to</text>
  <text start="152.66" dur="5.52">minister on his youtube channel and let</text>
  <text start="155.989" dur="5.25">everyone think he&amp;#39;s this holy person</text>
  <text start="158.18" dur="5.82">when I know for a fact he has secrets in</text>
  <text start="161.239" dur="5.191">in his life because he texted me I mean</text>
  <text start="164" dur="4.44">I you know I know the guy he&amp;#39;s come to</text>
  <text start="166.43" dur="5.7">my fellow shirts every day for a month</text>
  <text start="168.44" dur="5.609">and I know him okay and so so that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="172.13" dur="4.079">I do it it&amp;#39;s not out of vindictiveness</text>
  <text start="174.049" dur="3.961">or out of covetousness or out of</text>
  <text start="176.209" dur="3.991">anything I look I&amp;#39;d much rather just</text>
  <text start="178.01" dur="4.74">spend my time making edifying YouTube&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="180.2" dur="5.789">teaching the word and spending time with</text>
  <text start="182.75" dur="5.94">my brethren and sisters on skype but but</text>
  <text start="185.989" dur="4.381">this is part of my ministry in fact if</text>
  <text start="188.69" dur="3.299">you go to my website and you click on</text>
  <text start="190.37" dur="5.369">the statement of doctrinal beliefs I</text>
  <text start="191.989" dur="8.31">have 24 number 17 is exactly what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="195.739" dur="6.09">done in exposing Angelo and Alicia now I</text>
  <text start="200.299" dur="3.78">had another Christian couple who</text>
  <text start="201.829" dur="4.201">contacted me today and said Daniel how</text>
  <text start="204.079" dur="5.551">is this scriptural how is it scriptural</text>
  <text start="206.03" dur="7.11">to expose an individual on YouTube well</text>
  <text start="209.63" dur="6.54">remember Peter Apostle Peter he publicly</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="5.52">exposed and rebuked Simon the sorcerer</text>
  <text start="216.17" dur="5.61">and he didn&amp;#39;t do it privately he did it</text>
  <text start="218.66" dur="5.609">in front of everybody okay so there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="221.78" dur="5.73">example right there you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.269" dur="4.621">scriptural okay so people need to get</text>
  <text start="227.51" dur="3.36">out of their comfort zones that are</text>
  <text start="228.89" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re politically correct American</text>
  <text start="230.87" dur="5.22">culture and realize that there is a time</text>
  <text start="233.12" dur="4.41">and a place to expose specific</text>
  <text start="236.09" dur="3.03">individuals if they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="237.53" dur="2.82">influence now there have been some</text>
  <text start="239.12" dur="3.54">people who have chosen to leave the</text>
  <text start="240.35" dur="3.9">group and I have not made a YouTube</text>
  <text start="242.66" dur="4.889">about them or expose them in any way</text>
  <text start="244.25" dur="5.13">okay and I won&amp;#39;t because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="247.549" dur="5.101">point I know we&amp;#39;ve dealt with this</text>
  <text start="249.38" dur="5.01">privately and but Angelo and Alicia in</text>
  <text start="252.65" dur="4.27">particular they have these so-called</text>
  <text start="254.39" dur="3.88">ministries which really they don&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="256.92" dur="2.52">they do but they don&amp;#39;t but they have</text>
  <text start="258.27" dur="2.39">these ministries where people really</text>
  <text start="259.44" dur="3.54">think that they&amp;#39;re hearing from</text>
  <text start="260.66" dur="4.33">quote-unquote the Lord and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="262.98" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re hearing from voices that</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="4.5">actually tell Alicia and Angelo to</text>
  <text start="267.63" dur="5.22">contradict and go against what the bible</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="5.76">says and which basically means Angelyn</text>
  <text start="272.85" dur="5.52">Alicia are led by Devils demonic spirits</text>
  <text start="275.25" dur="4.95">okay whenever the Holy Spirit speaks to</text>
  <text start="278.37" dur="3.99">you whenever Yahshua speaks to you and</text>
  <text start="280.2" dur="4.46">he does speak to his people it will</text>
  <text start="282.36" dur="6.72">always line up with the word of Yahweh</text>
  <text start="284.66" dur="8.14">read Jeremiah 17 because Jeremiah 17</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="6.15">talks about where the people of Judah</text>
  <text start="292.8" dur="5.42">had become so apostate that even though</text>
  <text start="295.23" dur="2.99">they thought they were serving</text>
