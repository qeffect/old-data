  <text start="0.14" dur="5.26">shabbat shalom this is Daniel John Lee</text>
  <text start="2.61" dur="5.73">with Torah restoration ministries it is</text>
  <text start="5.4" dur="6.09">October the 8th 2016</text>
  <text start="8.34" dur="7.29">it&amp;#39;s the Shabbat the Sabbath between yom</text>
  <text start="11.49" dur="5.34">teruah and yom kippur i it looks like</text>
  <text start="15.63" dur="4.53">just a few days ago</text>
  <text start="16.83" dur="8.699">Zachary Bauer had a debate or discussion</text>
  <text start="20.16" dur="8.64">I guess with the leading vocal proponent</text>
  <text start="25.529" dur="6.48">of pre tourism dr. Don Preston who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="28.8" dur="4.919">based out in Oklahoma dr. Don Preston&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="32.009" dur="4.471">a full praetor&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;ll provide the link</text>
  <text start="33.719" dur="5.971">to to Zachary&amp;#39;s discussion slash debate</text>
  <text start="36.48" dur="5.34">I literally spent about two hours</text>
  <text start="39.69" dur="5.07">watching the whole thing and the problem</text>
  <text start="41.82" dur="5.46">with the problem with talking with pre</text>
  <text start="44.76" dur="4.59">Duras is that it&amp;#39;s very hard to pin them</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="4.5">down because they go on all these</text>
  <text start="49.35" dur="4.709">different rabbit trails and unfortunates</text>
  <text start="51.78" dur="5.189">kind of what happened with with Zachary</text>
  <text start="54.059" dur="5.701">Bowers discussion with dr. Don Preston</text>
  <text start="56.969" dur="4.831">but what I wanted to do real quickly is</text>
  <text start="59.76" dur="5.009">I just wanted to provide two very very</text>
  <text start="61.8" dur="7.23">strong scriptural points that I think</text>
  <text start="64.769" dur="6.21">cut to the heart of why pre tourism is a</text>
  <text start="69.03" dur="3.78">false doctrine and again for those of</text>
  <text start="70.979" dur="4.591">you who don&amp;#39;t know pre tourism basically</text>
  <text start="72.81" dur="5.19">believes that all the prophecies in</text>
  <text start="75.57" dur="6.15">Daniel and revelation were fulfilled by</text>
  <text start="78" dur="6.15">70 AD that Yahshua returned that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="81.72" dur="5.09">in the new heavens and new earth now and</text>
  <text start="84.15" dur="5.31">that all of it can be spiritualize Dawei</text>
  <text start="86.81" dur="4.419">the two things that I think are the most</text>
  <text start="89.46" dur="4.74">powerful arguments against Peter ISM and</text>
  <text start="91.229" dur="6.721">they&amp;#39;re very very simple the first one</text>
  <text start="94.2" dur="6.599">is in Zechariah chapter 14 Zechariah 14</text>
  <text start="97.95" dur="5.669">very clearly describes a time in which</text>
  <text start="100.799" dur="4.951">all nations of the earth will go up to</text>
  <text start="103.619" dur="4.68">Jerusalem every year for the Feast of</text>
  <text start="105.75" dur="6.479">Sukkot and if they don&amp;#39;t go up to</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="7.14">Jerusalem to honor Yahshua then they</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="4.68">will be plagued with no rain and the</text>
  <text start="115.439" dur="3.661">challenge to the pre Duras that you have</text>
  <text start="116.909" dur="4.591">to bring us show me in history where</text>
  <text start="119.1" dur="5.43">ever in history when this ever occurred</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="5.189">show me in history where nations did not</text>
  <text start="124.53" dur="4.949">receive rain were literally struck with</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="3.74">a plague of drought because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="129.479" dur="3.891">come up to Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="130.429" dur="5.101">to keep the feast of Sukkot feast of</text>
  <text start="133.37" dur="4.979">tabernacles so that&amp;#39;s the very first one</text>
  <text start="135.53" dur="5.099">is Zechariah 14 I have yet to hear any</text>
  <text start="138.349" dur="4.771">preachers to be able to refute that and</text>
  <text start="140.629" dur="4.89">be able to say you know oh that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="4.019">happened here you can&amp;#39;t really spiritual</text>
  <text start="145.519" dur="4.351">eyes the way Zechariah 14 because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.139" dur="4.891">very specific in what it outlines has to</text>
  <text start="149.87" dur="5.429">occur that has never happened in history</text>
  <text start="152.03" dur="4.679">and it will happen of course when the</text>
  <text start="155.299" dur="4.56">Millennial Kingdom occurs but it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="156.709" dur="5.4">happened yet and so preachers can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="159.859" dur="4.651">that that&amp;#39;s fulfilled the other very</text>
  <text start="162.109" dur="5.52">powerful argument that I think is really</text>
  <text start="164.51" dur="7.71">really good is if you go to Acts chapter</text>
  <text start="167.629" dur="7.071">1 and Yahshua basically bids farewell to</text>
  <text start="172.22" dur="5.609">the disciples tells them to go back to</text>
  <text start="174.7" dur="5.14">Jerusalem to wait for the the Ruach</text>
  <text start="177.829" dur="5.64">Hakodesh the Holy Spirit when the day of</text>
  <text start="179.84" dur="5.819">Shavuot Pentecost comes he rises up in I</text>
  <text start="183.469" dur="5.281">mean they see him physically rise up and</text>
  <text start="185.659" dur="5.73">go up into the clouds and the disciples</text>
  <text start="188.75" dur="3.989">are standing there sort of continuing to</text>
  <text start="191.389" dur="3.141">look up into the heavens even after</text>
  <text start="192.739" dur="5.61">Yahshua is disappeared behind the cloud</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="4.51">and all of a sudden in fact let me just</text>
  <text start="198.349" dur="2.28">read it here</text>
  <text start="199.04" dur="4.589">this is Acts chapter 1 starting in verse</text>
  <text start="200.629" dur="5.7">9 and when he Yahshua had spoken these</text>
  <text start="203.629" dur="4.711">things while they beheld he was taken up</text>
  <text start="206.329" dur="4.011">and a cloud received him out of their</text>
  <text start="208.34" dur="4.59">sight and while they looked steadfastly</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="5.319">toward heaven as he went up behold two</text>
  <text start="212.93" dur="5.009">men stood by them in white apparel which</text>
  <text start="215.659" dur="4.89">also said you men of Galilee why stand</text>
  <text start="217.939" dur="5.07">you gazing up into heaven this same</text>
  <text start="220.549" dur="5.31">Yahshua which is taken up from you into</text>
  <text start="223.009" dur="7.081">heaven so shall come in like manner as</text>
  <text start="225.859" dur="6.66">you have seen him go into heaven so the</text>
  <text start="230.09" dur="4.53">angels very very clearly testified to</text>
  <text start="232.519" dur="4.59">Peter and the disciples but Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="234.62" dur="4.5">gonna return the exact same way he left</text>
  <text start="237.109" dur="3.69">just as he descended up into the</text>
  <text start="239.12" dur="3.209">physically into the clouds he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="240.799" dur="3.481">return he&amp;#39;s gonna come back in the</text>
  <text start="242.329" dur="4.05">clouds and so of course the full</text>
  <text start="244.28" dur="4.889">preacher says that no Yahshua returned</text>
  <text start="246.379" dur="5.85">in a very spiritualize duay with the</text>
  <text start="249.169" dur="4.68">destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD but</text>
  <text start="252.229" dur="4.56">right here the angels testify that</text>
  <text start="253.849" dur="6.57">Yahshua returned physically just as he</text>
  <text start="256.789" dur="5.251">left and so those two two scriptures</text>
  <text start="260.419" dur="3.571">Zechariah 14 and</text>
  <text start="262.04" dur="4.35">chapter one I think are very very</text>
  <text start="263.99" dur="4.83">powerful and cutting right to the heart</text>
  <text start="266.39" dur="5.43">of the pre Duras and showing very</text>
  <text start="268.82" dur="4.95">clearly that this whole idea that all</text>
  <text start="271.82" dur="4.41">these prophecies and daniel revelation</text>
  <text start="273.77" dur="4.86">had been fulfilled with the events that</text>
  <text start="276.23" dur="4.02">occurred in 70 AD shows very clear that</text>
  <text start="278.63" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s just not true it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="280.25" dur="4.38">false and i found that using those two</text>
  <text start="282.74" dur="4.44">scriptures prevent you from going into</text>
  <text start="284.63" dur="4.62">all these different rabbit trails and</text>
  <text start="287.18" dur="4.56">and and sort of side arguments that</text>
  <text start="289.25" dur="4.44">pre-drill of to kind of drag you into so</text>
  <text start="291.74" dur="3.9">i hope this was a blessing for for those</text>
  <text start="293.69" dur="3.99">of you out there shabbat shalom</text>
  <text start="295.64" dur="4.47">Yom Kippur is coming up here very very</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="3.75">soon and we&amp;#39;ll be making a special cod4</text>
