  <text start="2.49" dur="4.079">fourth day of the twelfth month live</text>
  <text start="4.83" dur="3.74">Skype fellowship and we&amp;#39;re now going</text>
  <text start="6.569" dur="6.931">over the final chapter of Hebrews</text>
  <text start="8.57" dur="9.01">Hebrews chapter 13 let brotherly love</text>
  <text start="13.5" dur="6.689">continue that first sentence is very</text>
  <text start="17.58" dur="4.17">important because all through again I</text>
  <text start="20.189" dur="3.93">think it is Paul who wrote Hebrews just</text>
  <text start="21.75" dur="3.81">because of the different phrases he uses</text>
  <text start="24.119" dur="4.201">especially in the latter half of papers</text>
  <text start="25.56" dur="4.979">but all through Paul&amp;#39;s epistles whether</text>
  <text start="28.32" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s the book of Ephesians or Colossians</text>
  <text start="30.539" dur="5.101">or first row second Thessalonians or</text>
  <text start="33.48" dur="4.68">Philippians he&amp;#39;s always talking about</text>
  <text start="35.64" dur="6.54">how important it is for our brotherly</text>
  <text start="38.16" dur="6.75">love to be strong to continue to go</text>
  <text start="42.18" dur="4.74">forth that our love for each other</text>
  <text start="44.91" dur="4.469">should have bound more and more and in</text>
  <text start="46.92" dur="5.13">fact that is what as John says in first</text>
  <text start="49.379" dur="5.34">second third John that is what proves to</text>
  <text start="52.05" dur="4.71">others that that we love ya&amp;#39;s our love</text>
  <text start="54.719" dur="5.041">for each other so let brotherly love</text>
  <text start="56.76" dur="5.76">continue and be not forgetful to</text>
  <text start="59.76" dur="6.149">entertain strangers for thereby some</text>
  <text start="62.52" dur="4.98">have entertained angels unawares so this</text>
  <text start="65.909" dur="4.191">goes back to the Torah principle of</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="6.09">always letting the corners of her field</text>
  <text start="70.1" dur="7.059">be gleaned by the poor by the strangers</text>
  <text start="73.59" dur="5.01">by the Gentiles never forget to show</text>
  <text start="77.159" dur="3.361">your love to even people that you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="78.6" dur="4.409">know because you never know if it might</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="3.81">be an angel or not and even if it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="83.009" dur="5.161">an angel of course that&amp;#39;s not the point</text>
  <text start="84.33" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s to show love to all people first</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="4.62">day remember them that are in bonds has</text>
  <text start="90.09" dur="5.849">bound with them and then which suffer</text>
  <text start="92.79" dur="6.81">adversity as being yourselves also in</text>
  <text start="95.939" dur="5.281">the body so we need to be sympathizing</text>
  <text start="99.6" dur="3.299">with our brothers and sisters in Messiah</text>
  <text start="101.22" dur="3.78">who are going through tribulations going</text>
  <text start="102.899" dur="4.201">through hard times this is we are hoping</text>
  <text start="105" dur="3.2">that they will sympathize with us when</text>

  <text start="114.74" dur="6.239">whoremongers and adulterers yah will</text>
  <text start="117.95" dur="6.479">judge course contrasting the difference</text>
  <text start="120.979" dur="6.121">between marriage which is the only only</text>
  <text start="124.429" dur="4.86">time that sexual activity is permitted</text>

  <text start="196.819" dur="3.991">author here&amp;#39;s is referencing the pastors</text>
  <text start="199.31" dur="2.25">and the bishops and the leaders that</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="3.24">have been over</text>
  <text start="201.56" dur="6.57">them they&amp;#39;ve been living faithful holy</text>

  <text start="229.849" dur="4.051">should be a verse that we always</text>
  <text start="231.709" dur="4.411">remember that&amp;#39;s a jewel of a verse here</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="4.169">in Hebrews because that&amp;#39;s really what</text>
  <text start="236.12" dur="3.99">this whole book has been about is that</text>
  <text start="238.069" dur="4.591">Yahshua doesn&amp;#39;t change he was the same</text>
  <text start="240.11" dur="5.04">Yahshua who gave the Torah to Moses on</text>
  <text start="242.66" dur="4.53">Mount Sinai has the same Yahshua who</text>
  <text start="245.15" dur="3.899">helped you know Daniel and Babylon is</text>
  <text start="247.19" dur="3.84">the same Yahshua who walked with the</text>
  <text start="249.049" dur="3.901">disciples as the same Yahshua who</text>
  <text start="251.03" dur="3.87">appeared before Paul on the road to</text>
  <text start="252.95" dur="5.49">Damascus and of course he&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="5.82">Yahshua today hallelujah and when we</text>
  <text start="258.44" dur="5.25">recognize that verse 9 makes perfect</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="6.18">sense be not carried away carried about</text>
  <text start="263.69" dur="4.56">with diverse and strange doctrines what</text>
  <text start="266.9" dur="3.69">is a good thing that the heart be</text>
  <text start="268.25" dur="4.41">established with grace and not with</text>
  <text start="270.59" dur="5.67">meats which have not profited them that</text>
  <text start="272.66" dur="5.37">have been occupied therein that&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="276.26" dur="3.69">important verse right there very very</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="4.44">important because how often do people</text>
  <text start="279.95" dur="4.41">they want to get into all these meats or</text>
  <text start="282.47" dur="3.36">so-called meets of the scripture and yet</text>
  <text start="284.36" dur="5.64">they don&amp;#39;t have grace they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="285.83" dur="6.33">basic love or charity and so they wind</text>
  <text start="290" dur="5.19">up getting all puffed up they get pumped</text>
  <text start="292.16" dur="5.46">up in knowledge they get puffed up in</text>
  <text start="295.19" dur="3.96">in meats of the word and they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="297.62" dur="4.64">their not established in that</text>
  <text start="299.15" dur="7.32">fundamental grace or love that we need</text>
  <text start="302.26" dur="5.44">and then they could get by doing that</text>
  <text start="306.47" dur="3.66">thing get carried away with diverse</text>
  <text start="307.7" dur="4.44">doctrines okay we see this with people</text>
  <text start="310.13" dur="3.24">who get into the sacred name movement we</text>
  <text start="312.14" dur="2.94">try to figure out what the name of</text>
  <text start="313.37" dur="4.08">Yahshua is and they you know say oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.08" dur="4.32">yahoo I wash you out or whatever and</text>
  <text start="317.45" dur="3.26">they say if you don&amp;#39;t do this and you</text>
  <text start="319.4" dur="3.87">know you&amp;#39;re going to hell and here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="320.71" dur="4.36">100 page document to prove this is the</text>
  <text start="323.27" dur="3.03">right way to say his name that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="325.07" dur="3.57">type of thing we&amp;#39;re talking about where</text>
  <text start="326.3" dur="3.96">you start getting into meats and you</text>
  <text start="328.64" dur="4.74">forget the Grace and love and charity</text>
  <text start="330.26" dur="4.59">that should establish your faith there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="333.38" dur="2.85">nothing wrong with getting into meats</text>
  <text start="334.85" dur="4.83">but our hearts shouldn&amp;#39;t be established</text>
  <text start="336.23" dur="5.1">in that shouldn&amp;#39;t be established in the</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="4.11">the heavy things the word it should be</text>
  <text start="341.33" dur="4.05">established in grace and love and then</text>
  <text start="343.79" dur="7.92">yah will help us to get into the meats</text>
  <text start="345.38" dur="9.27">in the right way verse 10 we have an</text>
