  <text start="42.75" dur="3.75">calendar that is part of the Talmud you</text>

  <text start="57.809" dur="6.061">that&amp;#39;s how truth usually is yeah all</text>
  <text start="61.379" dur="5.581">right there is a vast amount of</text>
  <text start="63.87" dur="6.09">misunderstanding it seems like when it</text>

  <text start="74.189" dur="4.831">the New Covenant and the Holy Spirit&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="76.08" dur="5.19">purposes so because this is the feast of</text>
  <text start="79.02" dur="4.29">Hanukkah it&amp;#39;s about dedicating your</text>
  <text start="81.27" dur="4.47">temple sanctifying your temple just like</text>

  <text start="87.33" dur="4.469">the Greek Empire we&amp;#39;re going to go into</text>
  <text start="89.52" dur="4.55">this and I&amp;#39;m hoping to clear up a lot of</text>
  <text start="91.799" dur="5.101">confusion that seems to be amongst my</text>
  <text start="94.07" dur="5.17">53,000 subscribers on these issues</text>
  <text start="96.9" dur="3.899">especially amongst Christians who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="99.24" dur="3.96">seem to understand these basic concepts</text>
  <text start="100.799" dur="3.901">so we&amp;#39;re going to go over them and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="103.2" dur="3.36">gonna we&amp;#39;re going to get into this so</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="3.39">first thing I want to talk about is the</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="3.9">Holy Spirit the purpose of the Holy</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="5.34">Spirit so most Christians are very</text>
  <text start="110.46" dur="4.5">familiar with 1st Corinthians chapter 12</text>
  <text start="113.43" dur="2.31">where it talks about the gifts of the</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="3.03">Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="115.74" dur="3.93">you know rabbi shai will Apostle Paul</text>
  <text start="117.99" dur="3.78">talks about the gift of tongues</text>
  <text start="119.67" dur="4.92">interpretation of tongues healings</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="4.83">miracles by the way not everyone has the</text>
  <text start="124.59" dur="3.75">gift of tongues this live from the</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="3.18">Pentecostal church that says everyone</text>
  <text start="128.34" dur="4.11">must have to get some tongues to be</text>
  <text start="129.78" dur="3.66">saved that&amp;#39;s a lie and I&amp;#39;m going to read</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="3.42">it out right now</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="7.14">sorry when I get passionate it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="135.87" dur="8.31">because I love the truth Paul says very</text>
  <text start="140.58" dur="5.82">clearly in 1st Corinthians 12:4 - one is</text>
  <text start="144.18" dur="4.59">given the spirit of wisdom to another</text>
  <text start="146.4" dur="4.41">the word of knowledge of the same spirit</text>
  <text start="148.77" dur="4.109">to another faith by the same spirit to</text>
  <text start="150.81" dur="3.27">another the gifts of healing to another</text>
  <text start="152.879" dur="2.851">the working of miracles to another</text>
  <text start="154.08" dur="4.5">prophecy to another discerning of</text>
  <text start="155.73" dur="4.56">spirits to another divers kinds of</text>
  <text start="158.58" dur="3.42">tongues and to another the</text>
  <text start="160.29" dur="4.229">interpretation of tongues so see Paul</text>
  <text start="162" dur="4.53">says you know you may have all the gifts</text>
  <text start="164.519" dur="4.891">you may have 3 or 4 you may have just</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="5.789">one you&amp;#39;ll at least have one but not</text>
  <text start="169.41" dur="5.659">everyone has to get their tongues now so</text>
  <text start="172.319" dur="5.491">I wanted to spell that myth right there</text>
  <text start="175.069" dur="4.631">hallelujah so most Christians are</text>
  <text start="177.81" dur="3.77">familiar with these gifts at least if</text>
  <text start="179.7" dur="4.91">you&amp;#39;re from the charismatic Pentecostal</text>
  <text start="181.58" dur="5.049">are nondenominational persuasion</text>
  <text start="184.61" dur="3.549">familiar with the gifts and what&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="186.629" dur="4.201">more important than the gifts of the</text>
  <text start="188.159" dur="6.621">Holy Spirit are the fruits of the Holy</text>
  <text start="190.83" dur="7.17">Spirit so the fruits of the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="194.78" dur="6.31">which should be ripening more and more</text>
  <text start="198" dur="7.43">in your life every day love joy peace</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="7.41">and Shalom patience and long-suffering</text>

  <text start="208.5" dur="7.17">meekness self-control and temperance</text>
  <text start="211.819" dur="5.56">these fruits are even way more important</text>
  <text start="215.67" dur="5.099">but I&amp;#39;m going to show you something</text>
  <text start="217.379" dur="7.591">that&amp;#39;s even more important than all of</text>
  <text start="220.769" dur="8.25">us understanding that most Christians</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="7.469">ignore and that is the most fundamental</text>
  <text start="229.019" dur="6.841">basic purpose of the Holy Spirit which</text>
  <text start="232.439" dur="5.601">actually is rooted in the first fruit of</text>
  <text start="235.86" dur="5.099">the fruits of Holy Spirit which is love</text>
  <text start="238.04" dur="6.279">love amasai of it should fill your heart</text>
  <text start="240.959" dur="10.401">once you get converted and it&amp;#39;s found in</text>
  <text start="244.319" dur="11.971">Ezekiel Ezekiel 36 verse 27</text>
  <text start="251.36" dur="6.189">Ezekiel 36 verse 27 this is as Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="256.29" dur="3.06">is prophesying</text>
  <text start="257.549" dur="2.09">about what the New Covenant is going to</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="2.359">be a</text>
  <text start="259.639" dur="3.27">and if you don&amp;#39;t believe me just read</text>
  <text start="261.709" dur="4.14">the verse right before to get the</text>
  <text start="262.909" dur="5.01">context it says a new heart will I give</text>
  <text start="265.849" dur="3.84">you in a new spirit why put within you I</text>
  <text start="267.919" dur="3">will take away the stony heart out of</text>
  <text start="269.689" dur="3.061">your flesh and I will give you a heart</text>
  <text start="270.919" dur="4.921">of flesh this is referencing what</text>
  <text start="272.75" dur="5.009">Hebrews 8 which is quoted not only from</text>
  <text start="275.84" dur="3.66">Ezekiel but actually is directly quoted</text>
  <text start="277.759" dur="4.321">from Jeremiah 31:31</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="5.52">Hebrews 8 stipulates what the New</text>
  <text start="282.08" dur="4.799">Covenant is all about so as he feels</text>
  <text start="285.02" dur="6.179">prophesying about this new covenant and</text>
  <text start="286.879" dur="7.581">here&amp;#39;s what verse 27 actually says and I</text>
  <text start="291.199" dur="7.861">will put my spirit within you and cause</text>
  <text start="294.46" dur="7.9">you to walk in my statutes and you shall</text>
  <text start="299.06" dur="6.3">keep my judgments and do them well what</text>
  <text start="302.36" dur="6.329">statutes and judgments is Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="305.36" dur="5.79">talking about all Ezekiel had at that</text>
  <text start="308.689" dur="6.961">point was the Torah and the prophets and</text>
  <text start="311.15" dur="6.269">the Psalms we see Ezekiel says according</text>
  <text start="315.65" dur="4.799">to the holy spirit that guided him and</text>
  <text start="317.419" dur="5.49">filled him to prophesy about the new</text>
  <text start="320.449" dur="5.071">covenant that the Holy Spirit&amp;#39;s primary</text>
  <text start="322.909" dur="7.171">function is to teach us to walk in his</text>
  <text start="325.52" dur="9.06">statutes his judgments his laws his</text>
  <text start="330.08" dur="5.549">Torah loving God with all your heart</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="5.61">soul mind and strength</text>
  <text start="335.629" dur="10.5">loving your neighbors yourself wearing</text>
  <text start="340.19" dur="9.719">the seat seat covering your head wearing</text>
  <text start="346.129" dur="8.431">clothing of unmixed fiber following the</text>
  <text start="349.909" dur="11.28">dietary laws of Leviticus 11 now shall</text>
  <text start="354.56" dur="8.609">not murder thou shalt not lust living</text>
  <text start="361.189" dur="5.73">holy observing the Hebrew feast days</text>
  <text start="363.169" dur="5.55">observing the new moon keeping Shabbat</text>
  <text start="366.919" dur="4.59">like today from Friday night to Saturday</text>
  <text start="368.719" dur="4.711">night all these laws and statutes and</text>
  <text start="371.509" dur="4.741">commandments Ezekiel says the Holy</text>
  <text start="373.43" dur="4.5">Spirit teaches us to walk in them now</text>
  <text start="376.25" dur="3.99">there are certain laws in the Torah that</text>
  <text start="377.93" dur="4.259">that cannot be done all the laws related</text>
  <text start="380.24" dur="3.75">to animal sacrifices and the Levitical</text>
  <text start="382.189" dur="4.23">priesthood and that are connected to the</text>
  <text start="383.99" dur="4.2">temple and all that stuff that stuff is</text>
  <text start="386.419" dur="5.461">not going to be put into place until</text>
  <text start="388.19" dur="4.64">Messiah returns to earth and rules and</text>
  <text start="391.88" dur="3.289">reigns</text>
  <text start="392.83" dur="4.98">which will not happen and so we the</text>
  <text start="395.169" dur="6.06">Saints are actually transformed and</text>
  <text start="397.81" dur="4.77">physically literally caught up into the</text>
  <text start="401.229" dur="4.381">clouds to meet Messiah</text>
  <text start="402.58" dur="5.7">so all those laws pertaining to stoning</text>
  <text start="405.61" dur="5.459">laws and Levitical priesthood law glossa</text>
  <text start="408.28" dur="5.28">all that stuff we can&amp;#39;t do we&amp;#39;re living</text>
  <text start="411.069" dur="4.291">in Babylon but our heart should be we do</text>
  <text start="413.56" dur="4.56">as much as we can in our present day</text>
  <text start="415.36" dur="4.019">culture that&amp;#39;s what Daniel did in</text>
  <text start="418.12" dur="7.32">Babylon and that&amp;#39;s what Hebrews 8</text>
  <text start="419.379" dur="9.991">covenants all about walking in his laws</text>
  <text start="425.44" dur="5.37">his statutes his commandments doing all</text>
  <text start="429.37" dur="5.12">these things that&amp;#39;s what the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="430.81" dur="3.68">teaches us to do according to Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="434.58" dur="4.36">now what the Jews try to do is they try</text>
  <text start="436.99" dur="3.209">to keep certain statutes and</text>
  <text start="438.94" dur="2.52">Commandments and then they mix it up</text>
  <text start="440.199" dur="2.671">with Talmud their own man-made</text>
  <text start="441.46" dur="3.84">traditions which many of them actually</text>
  <text start="442.87" dur="3.93">contradict the Torah and so they wound</text>
  <text start="445.3" dur="3.44">up being filled with a satanic spirit</text>
  <text start="446.8" dur="4.769">but the christians do the same thing</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="7.12">they also bring in man-made traditions</text>
  <text start="451.569" dur="5.82">and stuff like keeping Sunday which is 8</text>
  <text start="455.86" dur="2.88">which was brought in by the Roman</text>
  <text start="457.389" dur="4.051">Catholic Church has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="458.74" dur="3.81">the Shabbat actually before the Roman</text>
  <text start="461.44" dur="1.979">Catholic Church was brought in at the</text>
  <text start="462.55" dur="6.81">Council of Nicaea</text>
  <text start="463.419" dur="8.011">and 325 so the Christians do the same</text>
  <text start="469.36" dur="3.63">thing they mix they mix the truth and</text>
  <text start="471.43" dur="4.979">they pick and choose certain parts of</text>
  <text start="472.99" dur="5.25">the Torah out of a love for Jesus by</text>
  <text start="476.409" dur="4.44">being covered by his blood filled the</text>
  <text start="478.24" dur="4.35">spirit we are to start walking in all</text>
  <text start="480.849" dur="3.69">his law statutes and judgments now</text>
  <text start="482.59" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s a learning curve we have to</text>
  <text start="484.539" dur="5.791">learn these things we have to read and</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="4.909">then obey and put these things in our</text>
  <text start="490.33" dur="4.41">lives there&amp;#39;s a learning curve</text>
  <text start="491.849" dur="5.53">absolutely but our hearts are that which</text>
  <text start="494.74" dur="4.2">are seeking to do the will of yon on</text>
  <text start="497.379" dur="4.44">obeying his Commandments just to please</text>
  <text start="498.94" dur="5.37">him to love him this is the new covenant</text>
  <text start="501.819" dur="5.521">any other gospel is false it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.31" dur="6.03">counterfeit it doesn&amp;#39;t fit with Hebrews</text>
  <text start="507.34" dur="4.8">8 which says I will put my laws my Torah</text>
  <text start="510.34" dur="4.319">my instructions in their hearts and</text>
  <text start="512.14" dur="4.079">their minds they will be to me a people</text>
  <text start="514.659" dur="3.721">and I will be to them a yahoo that is</text>
  <text start="516.219" dur="3.99">the new covenant and furthermore if</text>
  <text start="518.38" dur="4.52">anyone wants to say I&amp;#39;m not teaching the</text>
  <text start="520.209" dur="5.121">New Covenant Jesus himself said where</text>
  <text start="522.9" dur="4.32">the New Covenant is preached wherever</text>
  <text start="525.33" dur="4.56">the true gospel is preached this story</text>
  <text start="527.22" dur="4.68">will be told about the woman with the</text>
  <text start="529.89" dur="4.8">alabaster jar filled with that precious</text>
  <text start="531.9" dur="4.74">oil and she poured that oil on Jesus</text>
  <text start="534.69" dur="4.5">Christ&amp;#39;s feet she used her hair to wipe</text>
  <text start="536.64" dur="4.35">that oil into his feet and her tears</text>
  <text start="539.19" dur="4.25">mingled the oil and she showed her</text>
  <text start="540.99" dur="4.95">absolute adoration and love for Messiah</text>
  <text start="543.44" dur="5.02">so guess what now you can&amp;#39;t say that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="545.94" dur="5.04">preaching a false gospel because Jesus</text>
  <text start="548.46" dur="4.83">said wherever that story&amp;#39;s told the true</text>
  <text start="550.98" dur="4.83">gospel will be told so unless you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="553.29" dur="4.41">willing to call Jesus a liar now you</text>
  <text start="555.81" dur="4.35">have to admit if you&amp;#39;re a Christian that</text>
  <text start="557.7" dur="5.04">this gospel I&amp;#39;m preaching is the true</text>
  <text start="560.16" dur="5.88">gospel furthermore the book of Galatians</text>
  <text start="562.74" dur="5.52">the book of Galatians does more than any</text>
  <text start="566.04" dur="4.08">other book to tell us to keep the Torah</text>
  <text start="568.26" dur="3.66">I know that&amp;#39;s gonna blow your mind</text>
  <text start="570.12" dur="4.59">because a lot of Christians have no idea</text>
  <text start="571.92" dur="5.22">what relations teaches I have a very</text>
  <text start="574.71" dur="5.7">prominent teaching on my website you</text>
  <text start="577.14" dur="5.76">guys got a dig and searched it out it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.41" dur="5.7">all about the I go to the entire book of</text>
  <text start="582.9" dur="4.95">Galatians that book does more than any</text>
  <text start="586.11" dur="6.2">other book to show us to obey the Torah</text>
  <text start="587.85" dur="6.93">and to reject the Talmud hallelujah</text>
  <text start="592.31" dur="4.39">alright let&amp;#39;s get back to to the main</text>
  <text start="594.78" dur="5.34">point here so that&amp;#39;s the function of</text>
  <text start="596.7" dur="7.71">Holy Spirit now when the scripture says</text>
  <text start="600.12" dur="6.6">be perfect when God said to Abraham walk</text>
  <text start="604.41" dur="5.46">before me and be perfect when Jesus said</text>
  <text start="606.72" dur="5.64">in Matthew 5:48 be perfect as my father</text>
  <text start="609.87" dur="4.86">in heaven is perfect this Hebrew word</text>
  <text start="612.36" dur="4.26">perfect I&amp;#39;m gonna take the Hebrew rather</text>
  <text start="614.73" dur="3.48">than the Greek but the Hebrew word</text>
  <text start="616.62" dur="6.2">perfect comes from a word called Timmy</text>

  <text start="638.37" dur="3.12">of your heart your conscience is clean</text>
  <text start="640.23" dur="3.54">because you&amp;#39;ve been cleansed by his</text>

  <text start="652.56" dur="3.34">doing all you know to obey the</text>
  <text start="654.96" dur="3.39">scriptures and</text>
  <text start="655.9" dur="4.44">live right before yah and before men</text>
  <text start="658.35" dur="2.92">that&amp;#39;s what being perfect means it</text>
  <text start="660.34" dur="3.96">doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have perfect knowledge</text>
  <text start="661.27" dur="5.75">or perfect emotions or anything like</text>
  <text start="664.3" dur="5.52">that it just has to do with your heart</text>
  <text start="667.02" dur="5.14">is your heart in the right place and</text>
  <text start="669.82" dur="4.14">there are many Christians who they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="672.16" dur="3.03">know they were eating pork and they</text>
  <text start="673.96" dur="3.27">didn&amp;#39;t know because their past form is</text>
  <text start="675.19" dur="3.24">taught them but I&amp;#39;m here to show you</text>
  <text start="677.23" dur="2.67">what the scriptures tell you there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="678.43" dur="4.53">many others who teach this as well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="679.9" dur="4.74">not just me this is not a cult this is</text>
  <text start="682.96" dur="4.92">the prophetic movement the Messianic</text>
  <text start="684.64" dur="5.97">movement which birthed in 1967 of course</text>
  <text start="687.88" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s in the first century and it kept</text>
  <text start="690.61" dur="3.9">going until about the 13th century when</text>
  <text start="692.8" dur="3.66">it I have a whole article on this when</text>
  <text start="694.51" dur="3.54">it finally got totally persecuted that</text>
  <text start="696.46" dur="4.83">you barely hear about it after the 13th</text>
  <text start="698.05" dur="6.45">century but but it really took a revival</text>
  <text start="701.29" dur="4.95">and resurgence in 1967 well you can even</text>
  <text start="704.5" dur="4.71">go into the early 1900&amp;#39;s and you can</text>
  <text start="706.24" dur="6.6">find people that were teaching Torah you</text>
  <text start="709.21" dur="6.93">know so it was happy just very low not</text>
  <text start="712.84" dur="5.01">not well known but in 1967 took a huge</text>
  <text start="716.14" dur="4.32">burst prophetically because the Jews</text>
  <text start="717.85" dur="8.12">retook Jerusalem and yaws timeclock was</text>
  <text start="720.46" dur="12.21">moving forward in that Jubilee year ok</text>
  <text start="725.97" dur="9.16">so let&amp;#39;s talk about judging so people</text>
  <text start="732.67" dur="4.71">often misquote Matthew 7 one through</text>
  <text start="735.13" dur="4.07">five and says judge not judge not lest</text>
  <text start="737.38" dur="5.25">ye be judged</text>
  <text start="739.2" dur="6.85">folks actually look up Matthew 7 and</text>
  <text start="742.63" dur="6.6">read the whole context read from verses</text>
  <text start="746.05" dur="7.77">1 all the way down through verse 5 and</text>
  <text start="749.23" dur="5.91">verse 5 jesus says thou hypocrite he is</text>
  <text start="753.82" dur="3.45">addressing hypocrites</text>
  <text start="755.14" dur="4.44">he is telling hypocrites not the judge</text>
  <text start="757.27" dur="6.69">why because if you have sin in your life</text>
  <text start="759.58" dur="7.26">you should not be judging no way a lot</text>
  <text start="763.96" dur="4.98">of people they&amp;#39;ll start judging people</text>
  <text start="766.84" dur="4.5">and they themselves are guilty of sin</text>
  <text start="768.94" dur="7.17">you have no business judging people</text>
  <text start="771.34" dur="6.21">however if you&amp;#39;ve repented if Jesus is</text>
  <text start="776.11" dur="2.88">now sitting on the throne of your heart</text>
  <text start="777.55" dur="3">if you&amp;#39;ve been washing his blood and</text>
  <text start="778.99" dur="7.2">filled the spirit and you&amp;#39;re living holy</text>
  <text start="780.55" dur="8.06">perfect blameless then John 7:24 is for</text>
  <text start="786.19" dur="3.86">you where Jesus commands</text>
  <text start="788.61" dur="2.64">the judge not according to the</text>
  <text start="790.05" dur="6.56">appearance but the judge righteous</text>
  <text start="791.25" dur="10.589">judgment in first Corinthians chapter 2</text>
  <text start="796.61" dur="14.11">first Corinthians 2:15 through 16 in</text>
  <text start="801.839" dur="12.661">fact I&amp;#39;m just gonna read it first</text>
  <text start="810.72" dur="6.33">Corinthians 2 starting in verse 15 but</text>
  <text start="814.5" dur="6.089">he that is spiritual judges all things</text>
  <text start="817.05" dur="5.55">yet he himself is judged of no man for</text>
  <text start="820.589" dur="4.231">who has known the mind of Yahweh that he</text>
  <text start="822.6" dur="7.02">may instruct him but we have the mind of</text>
  <text start="824.82" dur="6.72">Messiah his sheep know his voice they</text>
  <text start="829.62" dur="6.57">hearken to his voice and they read his</text>
  <text start="831.54" dur="6.39">word and so we know how to make</text>
  <text start="836.19" dur="3.69">judgments and yet we&amp;#39;re judged by no man</text>
  <text start="837.93" dur="4.77">so this applies to any human being on</text>
  <text start="839.88" dur="4.35">the planet who has been grafted in to</text>
  <text start="842.7" dur="3.24">the Commonwealth of Israel by the blood</text>
  <text start="844.23" dur="4.169">of the Jewish Messiah Jesus Christ of</text>
  <text start="845.94" dur="4.079">Nazareth Yahshua any human being on the</text>
  <text start="848.399" dur="4.171">planet who has repented of their sin</text>
  <text start="850.019" dur="4.591">what does repent mean it means you not</text>
  <text start="852.57" dur="9.87">only confess what you did was wrong but</text>
  <text start="854.61" dur="9.659">you forsake it you stop doing it so if</text>
  <text start="862.44" dur="3.54">you&amp;#39;re pretending to be spiritual like</text>
  <text start="864.269" dur="4.621">you know Christ you&amp;#39;re still living in</text>
  <text start="865.98" dur="4.32">sin and you&amp;#39;re judging others you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="868.89" dur="3.629">nothing but a hypocrite and you will be</text>
  <text start="870.3" dur="5.01">cut into pieces and thrown into the lake</text>
  <text start="872.519" dur="5.551">of fire if you don&amp;#39;t repent you better</text>
  <text start="875.31" dur="6.36">repent if you love God with everything</text>
  <text start="878.07" dur="6.769">in you if your heart beats for him you</text>
  <text start="881.67" dur="5.779">live to put a smile on his face</text>
  <text start="884.839" dur="7.421">then not only are you supposed to judge</text>
  <text start="887.449" dur="8.291">but no one can judge you because he that</text>
  <text start="892.26" dur="6.389">is spiritual judges all things he</text>
  <text start="895.74" dur="4.469">himself is judged of no man for who has</text>
  <text start="898.649" dur="4.231">known the mind of Yahweh that he may</text>
  <text start="900.209" dur="6.261">instruct him but we have the mind of</text>
  <text start="902.88" dur="7.139">Messiah yes</text>
  <text start="906.47" dur="7.69">we those of us who love him we are</text>
  <text start="910.019" dur="5.601">priests and kings it may not look like</text>
  <text start="914.16" dur="6.96">it</text>
  <text start="915.62" dur="14.65">because to the world we are outcasts we</text>
  <text start="921.12" dur="12.02">are lowly we are considered idiots but</text>
  <text start="930.27" dur="5.16">we are kings and priests and one day</text>
  <text start="933.14" dur="5.29">after we get caught up to be with him on</text>
