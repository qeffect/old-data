  <text start="13.5" dur="5.19">including Pastor Rick and elder Dale and</text>
  <text start="15.48" dur="4.709">her email was very very evil</text>
  <text start="18.69" dur="3.12">it was very wicked she basically was</text>
  <text start="20.189" dur="4.741">trying to say we just need to all get</text>
  <text start="21.81" dur="5.28">along and have unity and just have peace</text>
  <text start="24.93" dur="4.8">and that&amp;#39;s what Jesus wants bla bla bla</text>
  <text start="27.09" dur="5.099">and I quoted to her Matthew 10 which</text>
  <text start="29.73" dur="3.029">says Yahshua came not to bring peace but</text>

  <text start="38.04" dur="5.4">Yahshua&amp;#39;s come to bring division a</text>
  <text start="39.96" dur="6.18">righteous division which in this case</text>

  <text start="52.829" dur="3.181">leaves his position as pastor because</text>
  <text start="54.42" dur="2.909">right now he&amp;#39;s an unrepentant sin so</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="3.54">he&amp;#39;s not fit to be a pastor</text>

  <text start="59.55" dur="5.819">violation of 1st corinthians 6 or he&amp;#39;s</text>
