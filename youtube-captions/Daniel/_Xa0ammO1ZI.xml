  <text start="0.38" dur="4.72">shabbat shalom this is Daniel John Lee</text>
  <text start="3.03" dur="4.32">with Torah restoration ministries it is</text>
  <text start="5.1" dur="7.2">the Sabbath day Saturday August the 5th</text>
  <text start="7.35" dur="7.199">2017 and this is part 12 of my 17 part</text>
  <text start="12.3" dur="5.34">series of reconciling the teachings of</text>
  <text start="14.549" dur="6.021">Messiah and Apostle Paul part 12 which</text>
  <text start="17.64" dur="5.549">is entitled 2nd Timothy 3:16 all</text>
  <text start="20.57" dur="4.959">Scripture is profitable actually were</text>
  <text start="23.189" dur="6.571">going to be dealing with dosis verses 16</text>
  <text start="25.529" dur="6.511">and 17 before I get into this again I</text>
  <text start="29.76" dur="4.17">had said last week that you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="32.04" dur="4.44">really my heart is for the body of</text>
  <text start="33.93" dur="5.039">Messiah to understand that although</text>
  <text start="36.48" dur="3.989">Paul&amp;#39;s letters are hard to be understood</text>
  <text start="38.969" dur="5.601">that really when you start understanding</text>
  <text start="40.469" dur="6.331">what he&amp;#39;s teaching that he really is</text>
  <text start="44.57" dur="3.91">upholding and supporting tourim that we</text>
  <text start="46.8" dur="4.41">should obey Torah out of a love for</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="5.37">Messiah but many people misunderstand</text>
  <text start="51.21" dur="4.439">what he&amp;#39;s saying you know when we think</text>
  <text start="53.85" dur="4.02">of the Great Commission we think about</text>
  <text start="55.649" dur="4.621">going out and warning the wicked and and</text>
  <text start="57.87" dur="3.72">bringing sinners to repentance and that</text>
  <text start="60.27" dur="3.179">is indeed part of the Great Commission</text>
  <text start="61.59" dur="3.569">but you know another part of the Great</text>
  <text start="63.449" dur="3.541">Commission is also to warn the righteous</text>
  <text start="65.159" dur="6.061">and and I can prove that because if you</text>
  <text start="66.99" dur="8.1">go to Ezekiel chapter 3 starting in</text>
  <text start="71.22" dur="5.31">verse 21 yah has just told his eagle -</text>
  <text start="75.09" dur="3.15">you know what you need to do in terms of</text>
  <text start="76.53" dur="3.33">warning the wicked or the blood of the</text>
  <text start="78.24" dur="3.75">wicked will be on his head but he also</text>
  <text start="79.86" dur="4.41">says in verse 27 nevertheless if thou</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="4.8">warned the righteous man that the right</text>
  <text start="84.27" dur="4.77">just send naught and he does not sin he</text>
  <text start="86.79" dur="5.759">shall surely live because he is warned</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="5.49">also Ballas delivered thy soul so the</text>
  <text start="92.549" dur="3.421">Great Commission is not just to bring</text>
  <text start="94.53" dur="3.03">sinners to repentance but it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="95.97" dur="3.21">storm the righteous as well but they</text>
  <text start="97.56" dur="3.21">don&amp;#39;t sin and I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="99.18" dur="3.899">pure hearts out there a lot of righteous</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="4.08">people out there who really do have a</text>
  <text start="103.079" dur="4.201">sincere love for Jesus for the Messiah</text>
  <text start="104.85" dur="4.47">but they don&amp;#39;t understand Apostle Paul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="107.28" dur="5.729">letters and so they&amp;#39;re walking in</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="5.549">ignorance and they&amp;#39;re not living to the</text>
  <text start="113.009" dur="4.981">fullest of how yot wants us to live and</text>
  <text start="114.869" dur="5.551">so this this is also directed toward you</text>
  <text start="117.99" dur="3.8">toward the righteous out there to warn</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="4.019">you so that you don&amp;#39;t sin that you</text>
  <text start="121.79" dur="4.27">properly use Paul&amp;#39;s letters because</text>
  <text start="124.439" dur="3.18">there are men out there who are unstable</text>
  <text start="126.06" dur="4.619">in the faith who will twist Paul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="4.831">letters to justify rebellion against the</text>
  <text start="130.679" dur="4.041">scripture against the Torah</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="5.73">and that is a very dangerous place to be</text>
  <text start="134.72" dur="7.09">so with that said we&amp;#39;ll go it right into</text>
  <text start="138.18" dur="5.639">part 12 here so if we go into second</text>
  <text start="141.81" dur="4.05">Timothy chapter 3 starting in verse 16</text>
  <text start="143.819" dur="4.941">Paul makes this amazing and</text>
  <text start="145.86" dur="6.03">extraordinary statement he says all</text>
  <text start="148.76" dur="5.89">scripture all Scripture I remember when</text>
  <text start="151.89" dur="5.01">he uses that word all scripture he</text>
  <text start="154.65" dur="4.98">cannot possibly refer to be referring to</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="4.14">the New Testament all right to the Brit</text>
  <text start="159.63" dur="5.16">hadashah because it hadn&amp;#39;t been written</text>
  <text start="161.04" dur="5.16">yet right it hadn&amp;#39;t been codified but</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="3.12">when he&amp;#39;s talking about Scripture he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.2" dur="3.96">talking about the same thing that the</text>
  <text start="167.91" dur="4.829">Messiah Yahshua talked about when he</text>
  <text start="170.16" dur="3.81">said the Torah and the prophets okay he</text>
  <text start="172.739" dur="3.75">constantly referred to those all</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="5.7">throughout the Gospels it says all</text>
  <text start="176.489" dur="6">Scripture is given by inspiration of yah</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="5.159">amen now so many people say oh we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="182.489" dur="4.771">under the Torah of Moses not the Torah</text>
  <text start="184.829" dur="5.52">of Moses the Torah was not inspired by</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="5.569">Moses Torah was inspired by yah it was</text>
  <text start="190.349" dur="5.121">given to Moses for him to write now and</text>
  <text start="192.829" dur="4.931">just like the prophets that were given</text>
  <text start="195.47" dur="4.57">messages from yata right now but these</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="4.229">are not from them they&amp;#39;re not inspired</text>
  <text start="200.04" dur="5.4">from these men they&amp;#39;re inspired from</text>
  <text start="201.989" dur="6.271">Yong from the same yah who sent his son</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="4.44">to die on this execution stake and who</text>
  <text start="208.26" dur="5.129">rose up three days and three nights</text>
  <text start="209.88" dur="5.9">later all Scripture is given by</text>
  <text start="213.389" dur="6.57">inspiration of yah and it&amp;#39;s profitable</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="7.239">for doctrine for reproof for correction</text>
  <text start="219.959" dur="5.31">for instruction and righteousness that</text>
  <text start="223.019" dur="6.211">the man of yah may be perfect thoroughly</text>
  <text start="225.269" dur="5.851">furnished unto all good works okay so</text>
  <text start="229.23" dur="5.25">all Scripture is given by inspiration of</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="4.83">yah and what what is the purpose of the</text>
  <text start="234.48" dur="3.18">Torah and the prophets what is the</text>
  <text start="235.95" dur="3.42">purpose of Scripture what is the purpose</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="3.27">now of the Brit hadashah the New</text>
  <text start="239.37" dur="3.479">Testament now that we can go to this</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="2.54">what is it with a purpose well Paul lays</text>
  <text start="242.849" dur="3.211">it out</text>
  <text start="243.47" dur="5.379">he says the purpose is for doctrine what</text>
  <text start="246.06" dur="4.38">does doctrine doctrine is by the way we</text>
  <text start="248.849" dur="2.97">have this funny idea of what doctrine</text>
  <text start="250.44" dur="3.81">means in the Western culture like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.819" dur="4.111">some sort of theology that we just kind</text>
  <text start="254.25" dur="3.51">of keep in our mind that&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="255.93" dur="5.46">doctrine is doctrine is literally what</text>
  <text start="257.76" dur="6.24">we how we walk out the faith how we walk</text>
  <text start="261.39" dur="4.029">out the face what we do to please yeah</text>
  <text start="264" dur="3.889">that is what doctrine is</text>
  <text start="265.419" dur="4.151">so it&amp;#39;s profitable for doctrine for how</text>
  <text start="267.889" dur="6.181">we walk out the faith it is profitable</text>
  <text start="269.57" dur="6.63">for reproof and for correction so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="274.07" dur="4.14">walking our walk we&amp;#39;re doing all we</text>
  <text start="276.2" dur="3.81">noted too pleased messiah and as we go</text>
  <text start="278.21" dur="4.77">and read the torah and we read the</text>
  <text start="280.01" dur="4.89">instructions therein it can correct our</text>
  <text start="282.98" dur="4.35">lives it can give us reproof and</text>
  <text start="284.9" dur="6.09">correction so that we don&amp;#39;t head off the</text>
  <text start="287.33" dur="6.27">cliff right so for example in my life</text>
  <text start="290.99" dur="4.35">I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m in love with the Messiah I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="293.6" dur="3.87">walking in him I&amp;#39;m a young man I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="4.889">raised in Christianity and then I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="297.47" dur="4.68">shown about the Sabbath day the seventh</text>
  <text start="300.229" dur="3.361">day is a week which is not any day the</text>
  <text start="302.15" dur="3.48">week it&amp;#39;s from Friday night to Saturday</text>
  <text start="303.59" dur="4.56">night it&amp;#39;s the seventh day the Shabbat</text>
  <text start="305.63" dur="5.849">oh that&amp;#39;s a correction of reproof I need</text>
  <text start="308.15" dur="7.05">to start observing that day and resting</text>
  <text start="311.479" dur="7.051">and not not working and breaking that</text>
  <text start="315.2" dur="4.86">that day so it was a message of reproof</text>
  <text start="318.53" dur="7.31">and correction to steer me on the right</text>
  <text start="320.06" dur="8.37">path for instruction and righteousness</text>
  <text start="325.84" dur="5.949">instruction and righteousness you know</text>
  <text start="328.43" dur="6.57">the best translation for Torah is not</text>
  <text start="331.789" dur="4.471">law the best translation to render it to</text>
  <text start="335" dur="3.539">modern-day English rapport is</text>
  <text start="336.26" dur="4.35">instruction it&amp;#39;s instruction these are</text>
  <text start="338.539" dur="4.171">these are instructions when Yana tells</text>
  <text start="340.61" dur="4.71">us what foods we can or cannot eat in</text>
  <text start="342.71" dur="5.55">Leviticus 11 when he shows us what days</text>
  <text start="345.32" dur="5.33">to observe like the Shabbat or the</text>
  <text start="348.26" dur="4.92">Hebrew feast days when he gives us these</text>
  <text start="350.65" dur="5.62">things he&amp;#39;s not doing this to sort of</text>
  <text start="353.18" dur="5.07">you know bind us down and restrict our</text>
  <text start="356.27" dur="5.119">activities or whatnot he&amp;#39;s giving us</text>
  <text start="358.25" dur="6.36">instructions to protect us to bless us</text>
  <text start="361.389" dur="5.411">to bring us closer to him that&amp;#39;s why he</text>
  <text start="364.61" dur="4.38">gives us these things he doesn&amp;#39;t give us</text>
  <text start="366.8" dur="5.52">these these instructions to touch punish</text>
  <text start="368.99" dur="6.44">us and the best analogy is like you know</text>
  <text start="372.32" dur="5.43">loving parents I love loving parents</text>
  <text start="375.43" dur="4.48">will tell their their three-year-old</text>
  <text start="377.75" dur="5.85">child not to go out into the street and</text>
  <text start="379.91" dur="4.8">and will even take restrictive actions</text>
  <text start="383.6" dur="2.52">to make sure that that three-year-old</text>
  <text start="384.71" dur="3.75">truck doesn&amp;#39;t go out into the street</text>
  <text start="386.12" dur="4.08">now that three-year-old child may be in</text>
  <text start="388.46" dur="3.269">a lack of understanding make think halt</text>
  <text start="390.2" dur="3.18">why are my parents being so mean not</text>
  <text start="391.729" dur="4.44">letting me go run out in the street but</text>
  <text start="393.38" dur="4.88">an actual fact it&amp;#39;s protecting him it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="396.169" dur="4.311">keeping him alive so he doesn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="398.26" dur="4.17">run over by a car and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="400.48" dur="4.26">what yaw is doing for us to these</text>
  <text start="402.43" dur="3.69">instructions now here&amp;#39;s the T just like</text>
  <text start="404.74" dur="3.24">that three year old child may not</text>
  <text start="406.12" dur="4.59">completely understand why his parents</text>
  <text start="407.98" dur="4.38">are telling him this he should still</text>
  <text start="410.71" dur="5.1">obey his parents he should still be</text>
  <text start="412.36" dur="5.49">happy to obey Him and and we as children</text>
  <text start="415.81" dur="5.1">the children of Israel children of yah</text>
  <text start="417.85" dur="4.62">we also may not understand why aught</text>
  <text start="420.91" dur="2.43">tells us to do all these things but we</text>
  <text start="422.47" dur="3.09">do it anyway</text>
  <text start="423.34" dur="4.98">and then maybe later we&amp;#39;ll get the</text>
  <text start="425.56" dur="5.43">revelation of old Wow see how really</text>
  <text start="428.32" dur="4.23">he&amp;#39;s looking for obedience not just for</text>
  <text start="430.99" dur="3">us to say well why uh why do we have to</text>
  <text start="432.55" dur="3.21">do this why fer do that way that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="433.99" dur="3.69">not the right heart he&amp;#39;s looking for</text>
  <text start="435.76" dur="3.38">obedience first and then understanding</text>
  <text start="437.68" dur="6.27">comes later</text>
  <text start="439.14" dur="7.27">so instructions in righteousness they</text>
  <text start="443.95" dur="6">these instructions from Torah truly do</text>
  <text start="446.41" dur="5.34">bless us and keep us safe and so now all</text>
  <text start="449.95" dur="3.45">of these things that structures that</text>
  <text start="451.75" dur="4.98">Scripture is profitable for what does it</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="6.26">do what&amp;#39;s the end result in verse 17 it</text>
  <text start="456.73" dur="6.3">says that the man of yah may be perfect</text>
  <text start="459.66" dur="6.37">thoroughly furnished unto all good works</text>
  <text start="463.03" dur="4.74">now that word perfect it comes from</text>
  <text start="466.03" dur="4.05">originally the Hebrew word Tomi on it</text>
  <text start="467.77" dur="4.5">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;ve reached</text>
  <text start="470.08" dur="4.29">the end goal that&amp;#39;s kind of our Western</text>
  <text start="472.27" dur="4.8">English idea of perfection what perfect</text>
  <text start="474.37" dur="4.71">means is a blameless heart it&amp;#39;s a heart</text>
  <text start="477.07" dur="4.44">that says I want to do all I can to</text>
  <text start="479.08" dur="4.71">serve Yahshua I want to do all I can to</text>
  <text start="481.51" dur="5.76">please them to love them to put a smile</text>
  <text start="483.79" dur="5.34">on a tape on his face and this is what</text>
  <text start="487.27" dur="3.27">the Torah does this is what the</text>
  <text start="489.13" dur="1.92">scripture does is we apply it to our</text>
  <text start="490.54" dur="3.24">lives</text>
  <text start="491.05" dur="5.75">it makes us that way thoroughly</text>
  <text start="493.78" dur="6.75">furnished unto all good works you know</text>
  <text start="496.8" dur="5.65">the only trouble you have with works is</text>
  <text start="500.53" dur="3.93">when you think that works doing certain</text>
  <text start="502.45" dur="4.11">things is what gets you saved that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.46" dur="4.05">never been the case you always come to</text>
  <text start="506.56" dur="3.75">faith in Messiah first you always come</text>
  <text start="508.51" dur="4.11">to faith in yo first and then the works</text>
  <text start="510.31" dur="4.32">result but those works are very</text>
  <text start="512.62" dur="4.41">important we have to be doing these</text>
  <text start="514.63" dur="4.59">works these good works because it proves</text>
  <text start="517.03" dur="3.6">that we have been changed that our</text>
  <text start="519.22" dur="4.53">hearts been converted that it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="520.63" dur="5.72">transformed by the Messiah and so as we</text>
  <text start="523.75" dur="5.85">look at the scripture as we allow it to</text>
  <text start="526.35" dur="5.41">teach us how to walk we allow it to</text>
  <text start="529.6" dur="4.41">correct and reprove our lives we allow</text>
  <text start="531.76" dur="4.8">to be instructions instructing us how to</text>
  <text start="534.01" dur="4.92">live out righteousness it makes us</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="4.38">perfect it furnishes us thoroughly</text>
  <text start="538.93" dur="4.98">furnishes us does a complete job</text>
  <text start="540.94" dur="5.16">furnishes us unto all good works that we</text>
  <text start="543.91" dur="4.02">can please our Father in Heaven that we</text>
  <text start="546.1" dur="4.17">can walk as the Messiah walk</text>
  <text start="547.93" dur="4.35">why did Yahshua come to the earth it</text>
  <text start="550.27" dur="3.81">wasn&amp;#39;t just to die on the execution ship</text>
  <text start="552.28" dur="4.32">stake and shed his blood that was not</text>
  <text start="554.08" dur="5.16">his only purpose another purpose just as</text>
  <text start="556.6" dur="5.28">important was to walk on this earth and</text>
  <text start="559.24" dur="6.74">show us how to walk out his instructions</text>
  <text start="561.88" dur="7.05">in the right way in a spirit of love</text>
  <text start="565.98" dur="5.38">hallelujah so this is a very powerful</text>
  <text start="568.93" dur="5.61">passage that Paul writes to Timothy that</text>
  <text start="571.36" dur="6.27">completely shows that the Torah that the</text>
  <text start="574.54" dur="5.13">prophets that the so-called</text>
  <text start="577.63" dur="4.2">quote/unquote Old Testament scripture</text>
  <text start="579.67" dur="4.53">that these things according to Paul are</text>
