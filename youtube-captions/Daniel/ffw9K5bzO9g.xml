  <text start="110.93" dur="3.33">there and even a given in book of</text>
  <text start="112.61" dur="3.81">Revelation it says he accused that he</text>
  <text start="114.26" dur="3.81">accuses the Brethren day night so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.42" dur="3.57">allowed to stand in the front room and</text>
  <text start="118.07" dur="3.57">accuse us of course jesus is our</text>
  <text start="119.99" dur="2.91">advocate but he&amp;#39;s allowed in there but</text>
  <text start="121.64" dur="3.51">it says in Revelation 12 that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.9" dur="3.63">coming a point in our future where God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="125.15" dur="3.42">going to finally allow Michael New York</text>
  <text start="126.53" dur="3.45">angels to totally cast Satan out of</text>
  <text start="128.57" dur="3.27">heaven where he can&amp;#39;t come back up and</text>
  <text start="129.98" dur="3.9">it says he&amp;#39;s cast to the earth and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.84" dur="3.72">so pissed because he knows that once</text>
  <text start="133.88" dur="3.69">he&amp;#39;s cast to the earth and he can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="135.56" dur="3.87">up to the heaven anymore he realizes his</text>
  <text start="137.57" dur="3.87">time is short he lets you know 42 months</text>
  <text start="139.43" dur="3.45">based that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s one weird that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="141.44" dur="2.67">Great Tribulation we&amp;#39;re in those times</text>
  <text start="142.88" dur="2.49">when he&amp;#39;s been cast he&amp;#39;s already been</text>
  <text start="144.11" dur="3.66">cast no he hasn&amp;#39;t he hasn&amp;#39;t been cashed</text>
  <text start="145.37" dur="3.81">down yet he has access to the throne</text>
  <text start="147.77" dur="2.61">room still he can still go up there and</text>
  <text start="149.18" dur="3.03">accuse us because it says he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="150.38" dur="3.24">accuser of the Brethren but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.21" dur="3.06">coming a point where God is going to</text>
  <text start="153.62" dur="3.63">totally banish him from lock him away</text>
  <text start="155.27" dur="4.02">put him in he&amp;#39;ll forever no no not yet</text>
  <text start="157.25" dur="3.989">he throws him down from heaven onto</text>
  <text start="159.29" dur="3.18">earth and on for earth there&amp;#39;s a three</text>
  <text start="161.239" dur="3.421">and a half year period called the Great</text>
  <text start="162.47" dur="4.47">Tribulation see when he&amp;#39;s thrown down to</text>
  <text start="164.66" dur="3.72">earth which I believe is going to be on</text>
  <text start="166.94" dur="2.82">December 28th because of Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="168.38" dur="2.75">Hanukkah is all about cleansing the</text>
  <text start="169.76" dur="3.51">temple it was when the Maccabees</text>
  <text start="171.13" dur="4.329">overcame the Greeks way a long time ago</text>
  <text start="173.27" dur="4.02">and Hanukkah was celebrated by Jesus in</text>
  <text start="175.459" dur="3.991">John 10 and it&amp;#39;s about cleansing the</text>
  <text start="177.29" dur="3.81">temple and I believe what better time</text>
  <text start="179.45" dur="3.93">for God to cleanse his heavenly temple</text>
  <text start="181.1" dur="3.45">than this December the 28th and he I</text>
  <text start="183.38" dur="4.2">believe he&amp;#39;s going to casting down to</text>
  <text start="184.55" dur="5.27">earth and I believe from 2014 to 2017</text>
  <text start="187.58" dur="4.37">Satan is going to fill the Antichrist</text>
  <text start="189.82" dur="4.21">probably like an early spring and</text>
  <text start="191.95" dur="3.73">basically it&amp;#39;s going to be like hell on</text>
  <text start="194.03" dur="3.45">earth I mean it&amp;#39;s going to be a really</text>
  <text start="195.68" dur="4.11">bad time here on earth but those who</text>
  <text start="197.48" dur="3.66">love God you want to press in keep the</text>
  <text start="199.79" dur="3.21">Torah do the things I&amp;#39;ve been telling</text>
  <text start="201.14" dur="3.36">will be able to go to the safe place</text>
  <text start="203" dur="3.78">because revelation 12 says the woman</text>
  <text start="204.5" dur="4.769">flees into the wilderness and Satan</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="4.86">tries to chase her but he can&amp;#39;t he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="209.269" dur="3.931">do it he the the the woman&amp;#39;s able to</text>
  <text start="211.64" dur="3.54">escape and I don&amp;#39;t know where the safe</text>
  <text start="213.2" dur="4.14">place is God knows and married he was</text>
  <text start="215.18" dur="4.38">talking about well Mary&amp;#39;s a picture of</text>
  <text start="217.34" dur="3.57">it Mary Mary gave birth to Yahshua two</text>
  <text start="219.56" dur="2.97">thousand years ago revelation twelves</text>
  <text start="220.91" dur="3.6">the whole metaphor for that covers two</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="5.59">thousand years Mary was part of the</text>
  <text start="224.51" dur="5.86">tribes of Israel yeah but in 2013 2014</text>
  <text start="228.12" dur="3.42">those who are loving yacht with</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="2.429">everything in them and loving their</text>
  <text start="231.54" dur="3.089">neighbors themselves those who really</text>
  <text start="232.799" dur="3.69">love Jesus I want to keep the Torah keep</text>
  <text start="234.629" dur="3.631">the commandments you know not just play</text>
  <text start="236.489" dur="3.841">around with the Bible but really press</text>
  <text start="238.26" dur="3.93">in and keep because Jesus did this he</text>
  <text start="240.33" dur="3.6">covered his head he loved his neighbor</text>
  <text start="242.19" dur="2.879">he did all the commandments those who</text>
  <text start="243.93" dur="3.029">want to press in you&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="245.069" dur="3.601">allowed to go to the safe place and it</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="3.241">says we&amp;#39;re going to be there for 1260</text>
  <text start="248.67" dur="3.179">days well that&amp;#39;s the same time period</text>
  <text start="250.2" dur="4.619">that the Beast rules because it&amp;#39;s three</text>
  <text start="251.849" dur="4.23">and a half years and it&amp;#39;s coming up so I</text>
  <text start="254.819" dur="2.431">would encourage you to come to our Skype</text>
  <text start="256.079" dur="2.731">meetings you know I&amp;#39;m not a cult or</text>
  <text start="257.25" dur="3.06">anything we believe in God we believe in</text>
  <text start="258.81" dur="3.12">Jesus weed legal by exactly what the</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="3.54">Bible says like even like I said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.93" dur="3.87">like oh we&amp;#39;re dead to the law and stuff</text>
  <text start="263.85" dur="3.9">but it&amp;#39;s like even no matter well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.8" dur="3.6">dead to the condemnation of the law yeah</text>
  <text start="267.75" dur="3.06">so what that means is like when I say</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="3.15">I&amp;#39;m dead to the law does that mean I can</text>
  <text start="270.81" dur="3.81">you know no you&amp;#39;re not you&amp;#39;re not a lot</text>
  <text start="272.55" dur="3.3">but you&amp;#39;re not a lot exactly yes and we</text>
  <text start="274.62" dur="2.82">can&amp;#39;t pick and choose which laws were</text>
  <text start="275.85" dur="2.819">going to keep so if it says thou shalt</text>
  <text start="277.44" dur="3">not commit adultery which we both agree</text>
  <text start="278.669" dur="4.021">on and it says thou shalt not steal</text>
  <text start="280.44" dur="4.229">which we both agree on it also says thou</text>
  <text start="282.69" dur="3.78">shalt wear blue fringes on the four</text>
  <text start="284.669" dur="3.841">corners regard and Jesus did this too</text>
  <text start="286.47" dur="4.05">and it also says keep the Sabbath day</text>
  <text start="288.51" dur="3.57">from Friday night to Saturday night it</text>
  <text start="290.52" dur="3.72">also says don&amp;#39;t participate in christmas</text>

  <text start="294.24" dur="4.17">in leviticus 23 like passover Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="4.829">so code also remembers his of the</text>
  <text start="298.41" dur="3.87">Sabbath from for men not meant for the</text>

  <text start="326.94" dur="4.5">Sabbath you&amp;#39;ve got to do the day that</text>

  <text start="331.44" dur="3.21">loving Jesus and resting it in</text>
  <text start="333.03" dur="3.54">throughout the week but the seventh day</text>
