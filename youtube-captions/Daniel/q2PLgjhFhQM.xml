  <text start="2.449" dur="6.671">Shalom and shabbat shalom it is now the</text>
  <text start="5.819" dur="5.671">sixth the Shabbat of the Hebrew new year</text>
  <text start="9.12" dur="5.91">since the Hebrew shemitah or Hebrew</text>
  <text start="11.49" dur="6.24">Sabbath e&amp;#39;er began in early April and of</text>
  <text start="15.03" dur="8.37">course the six Shabbat began last night</text>
  <text start="17.73" dur="8.219">on what was it may the 13th 2016 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="23.4" dur="7.44">now the morning of May fourteenth and on</text>
  <text start="25.949" dur="6.931">the sixth Shabbat I I have something I</text>
  <text start="30.84" dur="5.01">think I really want to talk about in</text>
  <text start="32.88" dur="7.26">terms of being a very very critical</text>
  <text start="35.85" dur="8.57">issue for the body of Messiah motor this</text>
  <text start="40.14" dur="7.71">week I received advertisement for a</text>
  <text start="44.42" dur="5.709">national Shabbat or spot of unification</text>
  <text start="47.85" dur="6.029">that is happening or was happening down</text>
  <text start="50.129" dur="6.421">in Salem Oregon in fact it happened</text>
  <text start="53.879" dur="5.491">yesterday yesterday afternoon into the</text>
  <text start="56.55" dur="5.61">evening and the whole premise of this</text>
  <text start="59.37" dur="4.77">was for the body Messiah the people who</text>
  <text start="62.16" dur="4.709">are keeping Shabbat too kind of unite</text>
  <text start="64.14" dur="5.94">together to come together praise and</text>
  <text start="66.869" dur="4.921">worship in to unite but then part of the</text>
  <text start="70.08" dur="3.51">advertisement said look we don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="71.79" dur="3.48">be we don&amp;#39;t want to bring division or</text>
  <text start="73.59" dur="4.83">divisive pneus we want to we want to</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="6.09">unify and bring unity and some of these</text>
  <text start="78.42" dur="5.01">issues you know like the calendar issue</text>
  <text start="81.36" dur="5.52">and things like that we may disagree on</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="5.7">you know but you know that&amp;#39;s okay and</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="3.599">I&amp;#39;ve heard this statement from other</text>
  <text start="89.13" dur="2.61">people within the body Messiah where</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="5.491">they say well you know we&amp;#39;ll figure all</text>
  <text start="91.74" dur="6.12">this out when Messiah returns so big</text>
  <text start="95.97" dur="4.32">problem with that now some people will</text>
  <text start="97.86" dur="3.99">quote Paul from first Corinthians 13 and</text>
  <text start="100.29" dur="3.78">say all you know we see through a glass</text>
  <text start="101.85" dur="3.87">darkly and you know we can&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="104.07" dur="4.95">anything actually that scripture talks</text>
  <text start="105.72" dur="5.73">about how eventually when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="109.02" dur="4.98">resurrected and we see yatra we will</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="5.309">know as we are known okay so we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="114" dur="5.49">everything through through Yas eyes the</text>
  <text start="116.759" dur="5.371">way he sees us then we&amp;#39;ll know as well</text>
  <text start="119.49" dur="5.9">how he sees us really has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="122.13" dur="3.26">with following the truth</text>
  <text start="125.53" dur="6.929">in fact a better model for what we</text>
  <text start="130.539" dur="4.081">should be looking at is earlier in that</text>
  <text start="132.459" dur="5.401">same chapter first Corinthians 13 it</text>
  <text start="134.62" dur="4.89">says love rejoices in the truth so</text>
  <text start="137.86" dur="3.66">whenever the truth is promoted the truth</text>
  <text start="139.51" dur="5.57">from Scripture than level rejoice in it</text>
  <text start="141.52" dur="6.06">and will hunger after it problem is</text>
  <text start="145.08" dur="4.27">people in the body of Messiah or people</text>
  <text start="147.58" dur="3.81">who claim to be the most body of Messiah</text>
  <text start="149.35" dur="4.109">are rooted in love so when they hear the</text>
  <text start="151.39" dur="5.099">truth it offends them and then we have</text>
  <text start="153.459" dur="4.741">problems now granted this advertisement</text>
  <text start="156.489" dur="3.451">this advertisement said look we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="158.2" dur="2.819">gonna tolerate any clear wickedness I</text>
  <text start="159.94" dur="3.03">mean obviously if you&amp;#39;re living in</text>
  <text start="161.019" dur="3.811">adultery or homosexuality or anything</text>
  <text start="162.97" dur="4.83">like that we don&amp;#39;t want you a part of</text>
  <text start="164.83" dur="5.28">this group and okay but when it starts</text>
  <text start="167.8" dur="4.08">listing things like the calendar issue</text>
  <text start="170.11" dur="2.97">I&amp;#39;m scratching my head because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="171.88" dur="3.03">thinking what the calendar issues</text>
  <text start="173.08" dur="3.96">actually really really important because</text>
  <text start="174.91" dur="3.99">that determines the days that we keep</text>
  <text start="177.04" dur="3.12">the feasts on I mean obviously that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="178.9" dur="3.48">very important just as important as it</text>
  <text start="180.16" dur="4.38">would be of the seventh day shabbat</text>
  <text start="182.38" dur="3.9">following following every week from</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="3.39">friday sundown to Saturday sundown</text>
  <text start="186.28" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s very important to understand and</text>
  <text start="187.93" dur="3.23">I don&amp;#39;t think many people would dispute</text>
  <text start="189.88" dur="3.54">that unless you happen to be a loony</text>
  <text start="191.16" dur="6.22">Sabbath keeper lunar Sabbath keeper</text>
  <text start="193.42" dur="5.43">which is total wickedness so the</text>
  <text start="197.38" dur="4.199">calendar she seems like it would be a</text>
  <text start="198.85" dur="4.77">very critical issue in fact even if you</text>
  <text start="201.579" dur="4.141">go back to acts 15 and the Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="203.62" dur="3.57">Council there&amp;#39;s this dispute about you</text>
  <text start="205.72" dur="5.19">know what should new Gentile believers</text>
  <text start="207.19" dur="5.46">do the resolution birth from the Ruach</text>
  <text start="210.91" dur="4.169">if you continue to read through acts 15</text>
  <text start="212.65" dur="4.35">is well have these new Gentile believers</text>
  <text start="215.079" dur="4.53">who are now joining into Israel have</text>
  <text start="217" dur="3.989">them at least follow four of these Torah</text>
  <text start="219.609" dur="3.69">laws you know three of which were</text>
  <text start="220.989" dur="4.891">dietary one was a sexual cleanest law</text>
  <text start="223.299" dur="4.53">but as they come to the synagogue and</text>
  <text start="225.88" dur="3.6">learn about Moses and they grow and</text>
  <text start="227.829" dur="4.5">Yahshua and grow in the spirit they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="229.48" dur="5.43">eventually learn the rest of Torah so</text>
  <text start="232.329" dur="4.681">even in that council there&amp;#39;s this huge</text>
  <text start="234.91" dur="5.06">rip they&amp;#39;re still saying look you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="6.17">to be rooted in the truth the truth out</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="3.21">of love</text>
  <text start="243.709" dur="4.571">when we try to unify when we try to have</text>
  <text start="246.45" dur="3.84">big things like what they had yesterday</text>
  <text start="248.28" dur="3.989">down in Salem we try to unify but we say</text>
  <text start="250.29" dur="3.869">well you know we&amp;#39;ll wait till Messiah</text>
  <text start="252.269" dur="4.051">returns to figure some of this stuff out</text>
  <text start="254.159" dur="3.871">and the calendar ish you know that that</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="3.24">is danger okay we&amp;#39;re not running the</text>
  <text start="258.03" dur="3.48">Republican Party where we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="259.56" dur="3.99">just you know hammer out a platform and</text>
  <text start="261.51" dur="4.439">you know we&amp;#39;ll hopefully agree and</text>
  <text start="263.55" dur="4.44">disagree to agree on some things and</text>
  <text start="265.949" dur="5.551">agree to disagree and now this is the</text>
  <text start="267.99" dur="6.149">body of Messiah and this book the Bible</text>
  <text start="271.5" dur="4.229">the scriptures it&amp;#39;s not difficult to</text>
  <text start="274.139" dur="3.75">understand us particularly when it comes</text>
  <text start="275.729" dur="4.021">to the commandments now granted I miya</text>
  <text start="277.889" dur="3.121">does say that it&amp;#39;s an honor for a king</text>
  <text start="279.75" dur="3.03">to search a matter out and there are</text>
  <text start="281.01" dur="3.39">some prophetic things that you know</text>
  <text start="282.78" dur="3.84">really you have to dig deeply but when</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="4.23">it comes to commandments when it comes</text>
  <text start="286.62" dur="3.69">to thou shalt not steal or when it comes</text>
  <text start="288.63" dur="3.539">to keeping the Shabbat or when it comes</text>
  <text start="290.31" dur="4.139">to just commandments these are basic</text>
  <text start="292.169" dur="3.87">instructions that Yahshua said unless</text>
  <text start="294.449" dur="3.03">you become as a little child you kind of</text>
  <text start="296.039" dur="2.971">know wise inherit the kingdom of yacht</text>
  <text start="297.479" dur="7.531">these things are not be difficult to</text>
  <text start="299.01" dur="9.12">figure out so really the the unification</text>
  <text start="305.01" dur="6.659">should come from up the love but love</text>
  <text start="308.13" dur="6.36">rejoices in the truth so we for instance</text>
  <text start="311.669" dur="3.901">let&amp;#39;s just take the calendar issue and</text>
  <text start="314.49" dur="3.09">I&amp;#39;ve made several videos about the</text>
  <text start="315.57" dur="3.54">calendar issue yeah there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="317.58" dur="4.32">people following different calendars but</text>
  <text start="319.11" dur="4.77">really you go to Scripture and you can</text>
  <text start="321.9" dur="4.769">very easily prove what the true calendar</text>
  <text start="323.88" dur="7.98">is very easily and very clearly and very</text>
  <text start="326.669" dur="7.141">simply very simply you got to go to</text>
  <text start="331.86" dur="3.989">Scripture now if you have an ego and you</text>
  <text start="333.81" dur="3.63">have your own little invested interest</text>
  <text start="335.849" dur="3.481">and you&amp;#39;re not really rooted in love</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="3.9">then you&amp;#39;ll get offended you&amp;#39;ll be upset</text>
  <text start="339.33" dur="5.309">and then people come see well okay guys</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="5.43">you know yeah well Messiah will set this</text>
  <text start="344.639" dur="3.601">all straight when he comes new now</text>
  <text start="346.77" dur="4.079">that&amp;#39;s Jezebel right there this is jazz</text>
  <text start="348.24" dur="4.799">about some false Jezebel spirit there is</text>
  <text start="350.849" dur="5.271">a right calendar you can figure it out</text>
  <text start="353.039" dur="5.88">through Scripture and you can have a</text>
  <text start="356.12" dur="4.51">gathering where you can present the</text>
  <text start="358.919" dur="4.171">truth and then if you&amp;#39;re rooted in love</text>
  <text start="360.63" dur="4.44">you can know that truth and you can</text>
  <text start="363.09" dur="4.35">change if you&amp;#39;re falling around counting</text>
  <text start="365.07" dur="4.05">oh wow let me look at the scripture be a</text>
  <text start="367.44" dur="4.5">barian search it out yeah he&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="5.969">that is what the scripture says there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="371.94" dur="7.209">only one true calendar</text>
  <text start="375.089" dur="7.09">that&amp;#39;s just one example the unity has to</text>
  <text start="379.149" dur="5.22">be based in love and truth love and</text>
  <text start="382.179" dur="4.71">truth and truth always rejoices in love</text>
  <text start="384.369" dur="4.83">I had an earlier controversial thing</text>
  <text start="386.889" dur="4.56">that happened earlier in the week where</text>
  <text start="389.199" dur="3.36">a friend of mine you know he decided he</text>
  <text start="391.449" dur="2.94">was going to celebrate Mother&amp;#39;s Day well</text>
  <text start="392.559" dur="4.68">brother stays rooted in pagan goddess</text>
  <text start="394.389" dur="4.471">worship okay and I don&amp;#39;t care what kind</text>
  <text start="397.239" dur="3.77">of good intentions you might have and</text>
  <text start="398.86" dur="5.369">loving your mother quote unquote uh</text>
  <text start="401.009" dur="4.69">excuse me the Israelites up dead good</text>
  <text start="404.229" dur="5.46">intentions to when they dedicated a</text>
  <text start="405.699" dur="5.46">golden calf to Yahweh and you can read</text>
  <text start="409.689" dur="5.49">in the book of Exodus how yah thought</text>
  <text start="411.159" dur="5.641">about that and then they try to say well</text>
  <text start="415.179" dur="3.3">you know it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that thing</text>
  <text start="416.8" dur="3.539">anymore doesn&amp;#39;t mean the pagan goddess</text>
  <text start="418.479" dur="3.9">thing it actually comes from early</text>
  <text start="420.339" dur="6.15">American culture back in 1912 and they</text>
  <text start="422.379" dur="5.7">try to paper over it nenen no no and I</text>
  <text start="426.489" dur="3.03">point this out to this friend and he</text>
  <text start="428.079" dur="4.46">gets really offended he gets really</text>
  <text start="429.519" dur="5.16">offended because he&amp;#39;s not rooted in love</text>
  <text start="432.539" dur="4.66">he&amp;#39;s really didn&amp;#39;t love it&amp;#39;s like oh wow</text>
  <text start="434.679" dur="4.681">okay why let me look at that one oh yeah</text>

  <text start="441.369" dur="4.56">goddess dash it and do that and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="444.399" dur="2.88">how our response should be when we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="445.929" dur="3.15">know something and we&amp;#39;re confronted with</text>
  <text start="447.279" dur="4.05">the truth and it may jar us at first but</text>
  <text start="449.079" dur="4.38">if again if we rooted in love it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="451.329" dur="5.31">offend us remember yah sure looked at</text>
  <text start="453.459" dur="6.21">this woman okay who is at the table and</text>
  <text start="456.639" dur="4.29">Yahshua turned a hint to her and you</text>
  <text start="459.669" dur="3.42">know she was hoping to get something</text>
  <text start="460.929" dur="5.4">from Yahshua said I&amp;#39;m not going to feed</text>
  <text start="463.089" dur="5.521">the dogs I&amp;#39;m here for Israel and that</text>
  <text start="466.329" dur="4.34">Gentile woman said yes but even the dogs</text>
  <text start="468.61" dur="4.649">can eat the crumbs at the master&amp;#39;s table</text>
  <text start="470.669" dur="6.1">she wasn&amp;#39;t offended by Yahshua calling</text>
  <text start="473.259" dur="5.37">her a dog instead she hungered so much</text>
  <text start="476.769" dur="5.63">for Yahshua so much for his true so much</text>
  <text start="478.629" dur="8.22">to be with him it she would do anything</text>
  <text start="482.399" dur="5.92">in psalm 119 it says toward the end of</text>
  <text start="486.849" dur="5.1">the chapter it says if you love Torah</text>
  <text start="488.319" dur="5.55">nothing shall offend you now certainly</text>
  <text start="491.949" dur="5.01">the spirit can be grieved you can be</text>
  <text start="493.869" dur="4.71">grieved I mean Yasha was greed when he</text>
  <text start="496.959" dur="3.12">saw the wickedness going on the top when</text>
  <text start="498.579" dur="3.24">he got that whip that went through there</text>
