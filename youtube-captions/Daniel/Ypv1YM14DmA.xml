  <text start="17.73" dur="5.76">or better known in English as the evil</text>
  <text start="20.97" dur="5.79">tongue the topic today is going to be</text>
  <text start="23.49" dur="5.64">called gossip and how we deal with</text>
  <text start="26.76" dur="5.459">gossip how we deal with Lashon Hara now</text>
  <text start="29.13" dur="6.21">before I go on to what Lashon Hara is I</text>
  <text start="32.219" dur="5.041">want to sort of play Charles Finney here</text>
  <text start="35.34" dur="4.77">and I want to explain first of all what</text>
  <text start="37.26" dur="5.49">lost Shawn Hara is not this is a</text>
  <text start="40.11" dur="4.71">doctrine that is very much misused and</text>
  <text start="42.75" dur="6.42">abused in the Messianic Jewish movement</text>
  <text start="44.82" dur="8.84">today and let me explain why Lashon Hara</text>
  <text start="49.17" dur="8.34">or the evil tongue or gossip is not</text>
  <text start="53.66" dur="6.85">exposing or identifying a teacher or</text>
  <text start="57.51" dur="7.039">someone with influence who is misleading</text>
  <text start="60.51" dur="8.039">people hmm or is falsely teaching people</text>
  <text start="64.549" dur="7.211">and and their and exposing them that is</text>
  <text start="68.549" dur="5.221">not Lashon Hara my ministry tour</text>
  <text start="71.76" dur="3.45">restoration ministries and the website</text>
  <text start="73.77" dur="4.139">that I have spirit and tour comm is</text>
  <text start="75.21" dur="5.85">often accused of the evil tongue or</text>
  <text start="77.909" dur="6.6">Lashon Hara because one of the aspects</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="5.61">of this ministry is we expose ministries</text>
  <text start="84.509" dur="5.911">that are not upholding the spirit and</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="5.4">the Torah I wrote an article last fall</text>
  <text start="90.42" dur="3.12">last winter entitled the most</text>
  <text start="92.07" dur="4.35">controversial article I&amp;#39;ve ever written</text>
  <text start="93.54" dur="5.07">in which I exposed 14 messianic teachers</text>
  <text start="96.42" dur="5.159">and leaders who in some way or another</text>
  <text start="98.61" dur="5.85">were not upholding the Torah and not</text>
  <text start="101.579" dur="6.271">upholding the spirit and by doing this</text>
  <text start="104.46" dur="6.089">you helped to warn the Sheep you helped</text>
  <text start="107.85" dur="6.269">to protect the flock that is not Lashon</text>
  <text start="110.549" dur="7.11">Hara Lashon Hara is not exposing pastors</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="5.43">or elders or leaders or teachers who are</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="4.051">promoting false doctrine who are</text>
  <text start="119.549" dur="5.1">teaching contrary to Torah or teaching</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="5.82">cron chary to the spirit hmm that is not</text>
  <text start="124.649" dur="5.67">Lashon Hara Lashon Hara</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="5.49">is not confronting your friends or</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="3.111">family or someone that you know who&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="5.66">belief</text>
  <text start="133.43" dur="6.66">who is in sin that is not Lashon Hara in</text>
  <text start="138.68" dur="3.479">fact there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="140.09" dur="3.869">biblical precedent in Matthew 18 of how</text>
  <text start="142.159" dur="3.39">to confront a believer who isn&amp;#39;t sin</text>
  <text start="143.959" dur="3.601">where you go to him first</text>
  <text start="145.549" dur="4.14">if he doesn&amp;#39;t repent then you take a</text>
  <text start="147.56" dur="3.36">witness or two with you if he still</text>
  <text start="149.689" dur="3.241">doesn&amp;#39;t repent you bring it before the</text>
  <text start="150.92" dur="5.429">congregation and only then do you treat</text>
  <text start="152.93" dur="6.24">him as a heathen so there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="156.349" dur="6.14">ways to expose evil if you read the</text>
  <text start="159.17" dur="5.959">prophets in the Tanakh they all were</text>
  <text start="162.489" dur="4.78">experienced that exposing evil</text>
  <text start="165.129" dur="4.961">identifying and calling out particular</text>
  <text start="167.269" dur="5.131">individuals who hated Yahweh though they</text>
  <text start="170.09" dur="3.899">may have claimed otherwise if you go on</text>
  <text start="172.4" dur="3.989">to the Brit hadashah the renewed</text>
  <text start="173.989" dur="4.98">covenant you will see Paul and Peter and</text>
  <text start="176.389" dur="6.121">many of the Apostles identifying evil</text>
  <text start="178.969" dur="5.61">even calling them out by name Paul goes</text>
  <text start="182.51" dur="4.77">so far in Corinthians to call out an</text>
  <text start="184.579" dur="4.89">individual who is involved with sexual</text>
  <text start="187.28" dur="4.47">deviancy within the congregation and he</text>
  <text start="189.469" dur="4.761">rebukes the Corinthians for not throwing</text>
  <text start="191.75" dur="5.639">this individual out of their midst so</text>
  <text start="194.23" dur="6.58">none of these things are Lashon Hara and</text>
  <text start="197.389" dur="6.301">I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many times I have</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="5.25">been involved with Messianics Messianic</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="6.12">Jews Hebrew Hebrew roots people who</text>
  <text start="206.06" dur="7.56">wrongly identified this as Lashon Hara</text>
  <text start="209.81" dur="6.12">and that&amp;#39;s just not true several years</text>
  <text start="213.62" dur="4.92">ago I confronted Abbey Ben Mordecai</text>
  <text start="215.93" dur="4.5">because he was peddling Kabbalah which</text>
  <text start="218.54" dur="4.979">is nothing more than satanic witchcraft</text>
  <text start="220.43" dur="5.399">I confronted him I exposed him and I</text>
  <text start="223.519" dur="4.821">exposed and confronted every single</text>
  <text start="225.829" dur="5.97">congregation in the Portland metro area</text>
  <text start="228.34" dur="8.079">who also promoted Kabbalah or was in any</text>
  <text start="231.799" dur="7.05">way tied to avi Ben Mordechai and again</text>
  <text start="236.419" dur="4.77">the cries were ah Lashon Hara evil</text>
  <text start="238.849" dur="4.741">tongue evil tongue no that&amp;#39;s not Lashon</text>
  <text start="241.189" dur="4.08">Hara that is a that is a valid ministry</text>
  <text start="243.59" dur="3.75">that is scriptural and needed</text>
  <text start="245.269" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s called righteous judgment and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="5.639">something the Pharisees failed to do so</text>
  <text start="249.949" dur="6.15">that is what Lashon Hara is not now what</text>
  <text start="252.979" dur="6.93">is Lashon Hara Lashon Hara or the evil</text>
  <text start="256.099" dur="6.451">tongue or gossip is taking facts about</text>
  <text start="259.909" dur="4.861">an individual and twisting them to suit</text>
  <text start="262.55" dur="3.96">your own agenda oftentimes you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="264.77" dur="2.31">confront the individual but you go to</text>
  <text start="266.51" dur="3.21">other</text>
  <text start="267.08" dur="4.589">and talk about them behind their back if</text>
  <text start="269.72" dur="3.81">you do happen to go to the individual</text>
  <text start="271.669" dur="4.411">you twist these facts against them</text>
  <text start="273.53" dur="4.59">you&amp;#39;re not really interested in the</text>
  <text start="276.08" dur="4.679">truth about their character you&amp;#39;re more</text>
  <text start="278.12" dur="5.13">interested in cutting them down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.759" dur="6.81">always driven by selfishness Lashon Hara</text>
  <text start="283.25" dur="6.81">is taking things twisting things to try</text>
  <text start="287.569" dur="5.481">to discredit a ministry order to try to</text>
  <text start="290.06" dur="6.72">discredit individual individual</text>
  <text start="293.05" dur="5.98">oftentimes the people or person who is</text>
  <text start="296.78" dur="5.069">committing this act they think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="299.03" dur="5.52">doing something good and Noble but when</text>
  <text start="301.849" dur="4.53">you examine what they&amp;#39;re saying you</text>
  <text start="304.55" dur="4.049">realize that they don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="306.379" dur="4.681">they&amp;#39;re talking about or at best they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="308.599" dur="4.401">mixing truth with lies for example</text>
  <text start="311.06" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s a number of websites out there</text>
  <text start="313" dur="4.09">right now</text>
  <text start="314.9" dur="4.889">calling me a false prophet and calling</text>
  <text start="317.09" dur="4.829">me this and calling me that and most of</text>
  <text start="319.789" dur="4.771">these websites that I&amp;#39;ve seen are a</text>
  <text start="321.919" dur="4.731">mixture of truth and lies they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="324.56" dur="4.859">they don&amp;#39;t get even basic facts right</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="4.269">and so this would be Lashon Hara this</text>
  <text start="329.419" dur="4.86">would be the evil tongue or gossip</text>
  <text start="330.919" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s no purpose to these people they</text>
  <text start="334.279" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re not seeking to actually bring</text>
  <text start="336.289" dur="5.761">the person to repentance they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="338.599" dur="5.07">seeking to cut them down and and puff up</text>
  <text start="342.05" dur="3.63">identify themselves and act like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.669" dur="4.831">trying to protect people but they have</text>
  <text start="345.68" dur="4.889">absolutely no regard for the individual</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="3.479">they&amp;#39;re speaking about no regard for the</text>
  <text start="350.569" dur="3.57">truth and no regard to bring them to</text>
  <text start="351.979" dur="5.101">repentance if you read the ancient</text>
  <text start="354.139" dur="5.49">prophets even in their most scathing</text>
  <text start="357.08" dur="5.97">rebukes the ones that Jeremiah and</text>
  <text start="359.629" dur="5.13">Isaiah and Ezekiel gave even in their</text>
  <text start="363.05" dur="4.739">most scathing rebukes there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="364.759" dur="5.671">this underlying plea in which he</text>
  <text start="367.789" dur="6.211">communicates the heart of Yahweh and</text>
  <text start="370.43" dur="6.03">that is please return to me come let us</text>
  <text start="374" dur="4.469">reason together even when Yahweh is</text>
  <text start="376.46" dur="4.709">threatening to spread them like dung</text>
  <text start="378.469" dur="4.35">across the earth he in almost the same</text>
  <text start="381.169" dur="5.041">breath is saying but if you would but</text>
  <text start="382.819" dur="5.97">repent if you would return to me if you</text>
  <text start="386.21" dur="4.35">would if you would come and humble</text>
  <text start="388.789" dur="5.401">yourself I would cleanse you of your</text>
  <text start="390.56" dur="6.57">sins and I would take you back this is</text>
  <text start="394.19" dur="5.77">the heart of somebody who&amp;#39;s who&amp;#39;s truly</text>
  <text start="397.13" dur="5.409">loving the person that they&amp;#39;re exposing</text>
  <text start="399.96" dur="4.739">but to expose someone just for exposing</text>
  <text start="402.539" dur="5.13">sake that that&amp;#39;s often wrong and as</text>
  <text start="404.699" dur="5.881">often misleading so whenever you take</text>
  <text start="407.669" dur="4.711">facts you misinterpret them or twist</text>
  <text start="410.58" dur="3.72">them or don&amp;#39;t have them correct and</text>
  <text start="412.38" dur="4.89">you&amp;#39;re doing it out of a motive to cut</text>
  <text start="414.3" dur="5.339">the person down and not to bring the</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="4.53">repentance that is Lashon Hara and that</text>
  <text start="419.639" dur="4.891">goes on all the time particularly</text>
  <text start="421.8" dur="5.54">against ministries that are are valuable</text>
  <text start="424.53" dur="5.28">to the body of Messiah to people who are</text>
  <text start="427.34" dur="4.93">promoting Yahweh promoting his Torah</text>
  <text start="429.81" dur="4.079">actively working in the spirit and there</text>
  <text start="432.27" dur="4.44">are those who are set against them and</text>
  <text start="433.889" dur="5.731">so they participate in gossip and</text>
  <text start="436.71" dur="4.079">slander to try to cut them down and this</text>
  <text start="439.62" dur="5.99">is totally and completely inappropriate</text>
  <text start="440.789" dur="7.861">so that is what to true Lashon Hara is</text>
  <text start="445.61" dur="5.86">when you confront somebody in their sin</text>
  <text start="448.65" dur="4.259">and you say look this this is your sin</text>
  <text start="451.47" dur="3.15">this is what you&amp;#39;ve done you need to do</text>
  <text start="452.909" dur="3.661">this this and this to take care of this</text>
  <text start="454.62" dur="4.049">and to correct it and you need to repent</text>
  <text start="456.57" dur="4.499">that&amp;#39;s not Lashon Hara that&amp;#39;s a loving</text>
  <text start="458.669" dur="5.911">act of trying to warn your brother we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="461.069" dur="6.181">commanded to do that oftentimes when a</text>
  <text start="464.58" dur="5.28">wrong application of Lashon Hara is</text>
  <text start="467.25" dur="4.11">being applied there&amp;#39;s in the same breath</text>
  <text start="469.86" dur="4.08">people saying we&amp;#39;ll judge not judge not</text>
  <text start="471.36" dur="4.559">and that that totally takes that</text>
  <text start="473.94" dur="5.039">scripture out of context judge not lest</text>
  <text start="475.919" dur="4.53">ye be judges from Matthew chapter 7 the</text>
  <text start="478.979" dur="3.601">first five verses it&amp;#39;s addressed to</text>
  <text start="480.449" dur="3.511">hypocrites to those who still have sin</text>
  <text start="482.58" dur="3.839">in their hearts and they are not to</text>
  <text start="483.96" dur="4.56">judge but in that same chapter of just a</text>
  <text start="486.419" dur="4.651">little bit later Yahshua commands</text>
  <text start="488.52" dur="4.05">believers to judge a false prophet from</text>
  <text start="491.07" dur="4.469">a true prophet depending on the fruit</text>
  <text start="492.57" dur="5.069">that they bear in John 7:24 it says</text>
  <text start="495.539" dur="3.961">judge not according to appearance but</text>
  <text start="497.639" dur="3.481">Judge righteous judgment so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="499.5" dur="4.08">commanded to judge we&amp;#39;re commanded to</text>
  <text start="501.12" dur="5.13">discern good and evil were commanded to</text>
  <text start="503.58" dur="4.32">expose and to reprove and to review with</text>
  <text start="506.25" dur="4.05">all long-suffering effect the book of</text>
  <text start="507.9" dur="5.699">Proverbs says open rebuke is better than</text>
  <text start="510.3" dur="5.46">secret love but well often what we have</text>
  <text start="513.599" dur="4.98">in those who are committing Lashon Hara</text>
  <text start="515.76" dur="3.99">is they hate the open rebuke because</text>
  <text start="518.579" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re working in secret they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="519.75" dur="5.209">speaking behind the person&amp;#39;s back and</text>
  <text start="522.839" dur="4.801">they have this quote-unquote secret love</text>
  <text start="524.959" dur="5.5">which is actually not love at all it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="6.06">actually hatred so that is what true</text>
  <text start="530.459" dur="6.751">Lashon Hara is and is not</text>
  <text start="533.7" dur="8.49">so I and this ministry encourages you to</text>
  <text start="537.21" dur="7.02">expose evil to expose hypocrisy to to</text>
  <text start="542.19" dur="3.6">confront ministries individuals</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="4.92">particularly their pastors or teachers</text>
  <text start="545.79" dur="4.41">or leaders in their sin with the with</text>
  <text start="549.15" dur="3.18">the motive of bringing them to</text>
  <text start="550.2" dur="4.05">repentance but not to twist facts and</text>
