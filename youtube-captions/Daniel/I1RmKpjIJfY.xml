  <text start="8.97" dur="5.16">getting toward the end of the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="10.17" dur="6.27">here in Oregon and I wanted to make this</text>
  <text start="14.13" dur="4.11">podcast because now that Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="16.44" dur="3.419">has been elected there are some very key</text>
  <text start="18.24" dur="4.709">prophetic things that are going to begin</text>
  <text start="19.859" dur="5.971">to unfold and I begin the and I believe</text>
  <text start="22.949" dur="5.431">to begin unfold very very very quickly</text>
  <text start="25.83" dur="4.619">one thing to keep in mind if Hillary</text>
  <text start="28.38" dur="5.76">were elected she would be much like</text>
  <text start="30.449" dur="5.431">Obama and the scripture says that in the</text>
  <text start="34.14" dur="4.14">time of the end if it were possible even</text>
  <text start="35.88" dur="3.69">the very elect would be deceived well</text>
  <text start="38.28" dur="2.939">the very elect are not going to be</text>
  <text start="39.57" dur="3.63">deceived by someone like Hillary or</text>
  <text start="41.219" dur="5.131">someone like Obama okay they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="43.2" dur="5.22">out-and-out evil however with someone</text>
  <text start="46.35" dur="5.22">like Trump who&amp;#39;s been now elected to the</text>
  <text start="48.42" dur="5.459">highest office of the land we will see</text>
  <text start="51.57" dur="4.259">something that will go forth that if it</text>
  <text start="53.879" dur="3.27">were possible could deceive the very</text>
  <text start="55.829" dur="5.131">elect what do I mean by that</text>
  <text start="57.149" dur="8.37">so when Trump gave his victory speech on</text>
  <text start="60.96" dur="6.63">Tuesday night he talked about how one of</text>
  <text start="65.519" dur="4.381">the things that he&amp;#39;s done is he goes to</text>
  <text start="67.59" dur="5.31">places and he tries to untap people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="69.9" dur="5.16">potential and specifically and what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="4.23">been doing is building he builds things</text>
  <text start="75.06" dur="5.309">and of course he&amp;#39;s wanting to build the</text>
  <text start="77.13" dur="5.46">wall on our southern border as soon as I</text>
  <text start="80.369" dur="4.051">heard that statement that he made on</text>
  <text start="82.59" dur="4.8">Tuesday night after his victory</text>
  <text start="84.42" dur="4.71">I knew that Trump was going to be used</text>
  <text start="87.39" dur="5.369">to allow the Jews to rebuild the temple</text>
  <text start="89.13" dur="6.21">and lo and behold I have this story here</text>

  <text start="108.27" dur="6.419">so just literally two days after Trump</text>
  <text start="111.18" dur="5.729">won the election it says the Sanhedrin</text>
  <text start="114.689" dur="5.731">asked Putin and Trump to build Third</text>

  <text start="135.15" dur="4.53">of course I&amp;#39;ve talked about how a lot of</text>
  <text start="138.18" dur="3.75">people especially in the Christian world</text>
  <text start="139.68" dur="6.66">have talked about how Trump has this</text>
  <text start="141.93" dur="5.82">Cyrus anointing I&amp;#39;ll just read a bit of</text>
  <text start="146.34" dur="3.45">the story here says the National</text>

  <text start="160.86" dur="3.81">for the Sanhedrin contacted breaking</text>
  <text start="162.989" dur="3.72">usual news to announce that the election</text>
  <text start="164.67" dur="3.78">of Trump who is promised to recognize</text>
  <text start="166.709" dur="4.021">Jerusalem as the capital of Israel</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="4.44">coupled with Putin&amp;#39;s expressed desire</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="3.599">for the temple to be rebuilt prompted</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="3.51">the Jewish court to send a letter</text>
  <text start="174.329" dur="5.101">offering the two the opportunity to act</text>
  <text start="176.4" dur="5.309">as a modern day as modern-day Cyrus</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="4.88">figures non-jewish Kings who recognize</text>
  <text start="181.709" dur="6.12">the importance of Israel and the temple</text>
  <text start="184.31" dur="6.009">so right here they&amp;#39;re calling upon Trump</text>
  <text start="187.829" dur="4.5">and Putin to to do this and in fact if</text>
  <text start="190.319" dur="3.931">you scroll a little bit down the story</text>
  <text start="192.329" dur="3.3">it says rabbi Weiss explained that the</text>
  <text start="194.25" dur="3.81">u.s. elections have made the eternal</text>
  <text start="195.629" dur="4.501">Jewish dream a very real possibility we</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="4.17">are poised to rebuild the temple the</text>
  <text start="200.13" dur="3.81">political conditions today in which the</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="3.629">two most important national leaders in</text>
  <text start="203.94" dur="3.299">the world support the Jewish right to</text>
  <text start="205.859" dur="5.821">Jerusalem as their spiritual inheritance</text>
  <text start="207.239" dur="6">is historically unprecedented the</text>
  <text start="211.68" dur="4.169">sanhedrin&amp;#39;s letter notes that trumps</text>
  <text start="213.239" dur="4.711">upset victory was due to his support of</text>
  <text start="215.849" dur="3.901">Jerusalem and reminds Trump of his</text>
  <text start="217.95" dur="4.11">campaign promise to move the u embassy</text>
  <text start="219.75" dur="4.38">from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem effectively</text>
  <text start="222.06" dur="4.98">recognizing the city as the capital of</text>
  <text start="224.13" dur="5.669">Israel the Jerusalem embassy Act passed</text>
  <text start="227.04" dur="4.47">in Congress in 1995 initiated the moving</text>
  <text start="229.799" dur="4.651">of the embassy but has been beated since</text>
  <text start="231.51" dur="4.74">every American president has been vetoed</text>
  <text start="234.45" dur="3.78">by every American president since the</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="5.13">Sanhedrin calls on Trump to withhold the</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="6.27">veto after he takes office and then it</text>
  <text start="241.38" dur="4.829">continues to describe also how Putin is</text>
  <text start="244.5" dur="7.47">also wanting the third temple to be</text>
  <text start="246.209" dur="9.15">rebuilt so and this is all via this is</text>
  <text start="251.97" dur="6.84">all very true Trump did promise during a</text>
  <text start="255.359" dur="5.25">specific speech he made to to the</text>
  <text start="258.81" dur="3.63">Zionists he promised that he would move</text>
  <text start="260.609" dur="3.93">the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="262.44" dur="5.4">and recognized Jerusalem as the capital</text>
  <text start="264.539" dur="5.431">of Israel which no president has done</text>
  <text start="267.84" dur="4.98">so that combined with the fact that</text>
  <text start="269.97" dur="5.58">Trump&amp;#39;s actually daughter is married to</text>
  <text start="272.82" dur="5.129">a very prominent Jew when she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="4.02">converted to Judaism combined with the</text>
  <text start="277.949" dur="3.84">fact that Trump is very pro-israel I</text>
  <text start="279.57" dur="4.08">think is all going to play into Trump</text>
  <text start="281.789" dur="4.081">allowing Israel to rebuild their temple</text>
  <text start="283.65" dur="5.46">just as Trump wants to build the wall</text>
  <text start="285.87" dur="5.37">now of course this temple this third</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="4.02">temple will be completely apostate this</text>
  <text start="291.24" dur="3.57">is not something that anyone who loves</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="3.509">Yahshua who is covered by his blood and</text>
  <text start="294.81" dur="4.079">obeys his Torah his commandments should</text>
  <text start="296.639" dur="5.4">have anything to do with it will be</text>
  <text start="298.889" dur="5.101">completely and totally apostate but I do</text>
  <text start="302.039" dur="4.291">believe and I think this is the</text>
  <text start="303.99" dur="5.01">prediction I&amp;#39;m going to make not of thus</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="5.04">saith yah but just a prediction I think</text>
  <text start="309" dur="5.22">is very likely to happen and that is I</text>
  <text start="311.37" dur="5.88">think in 2017 which I believe again is a</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="6.93">Jubilee year 50 years from 1967 when the</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="5.55">Jews retook Jerusalem I think in 2017</text>
  <text start="321.15" dur="2.88">not only is Trump going to begin</text>
  <text start="322.8" dur="3.989">constructing the wall on our southern</text>
  <text start="324.03" dur="5.4">border but he&amp;#39;s going to allow the Jews</text>
  <text start="326.789" dur="5.301">and and work things out to allow the</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="7.89">Israelis to rebuild their temple in</text>
  <text start="332.09" dur="6.82">Jerusalem now that is the first where I</text>
  <text start="337.32" dur="3.569">wanted to talk about the second story</text>
  <text start="338.91" dur="5.789">which I will put also as a link right</text>
  <text start="340.889" dur="5.611">below this video is about the false free</text>
  <text start="344.699" dur="5.431">gathering now there is an organization</text>
  <text start="346.5" dur="5.4">called B&amp;#39;nai Yosef in fact the title of</text>
  <text start="350.13" dur="3.45">the story is B&amp;#39;nai Yosef declares the</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="4.17">birth of a new nation brothers of Judah</text>
  <text start="353.58" dur="5.22">and they believe they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="356.07" dur="5.52">fulfill Ezekiel 37 and 38 by bringing</text>
  <text start="358.8" dur="5.31">ephraim and judah together and they</text>
  <text start="361.59" dur="3.9">believe that ephraim are christians who</text>
  <text start="364.11" dur="6.5">are returning to the hebrew roots of the</text>
  <text start="365.49" dur="8.16">faith and they talk about how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.61" dur="5.17">there they&amp;#39;re wanting to allow</text>
  <text start="373.65" dur="4.56">Christians returning to the Hebrew roots</text>
  <text start="375.78" dur="5.79">of their faith to return to Israel to</text>
  <text start="378.21" dur="5.34">fulfill this prophecy now this is very</text>
  <text start="381.57" dur="3.06">wicked because the only way that Judah</text>
  <text start="383.55" dur="3.39">and Ephraim are going to be joined</text>
  <text start="384.63" dur="4.65">together as described in Ezekiel 37 is</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="4.789">at the seventh trumpet resurrection when</text>
  <text start="389.28" dur="5.34">Yahshua blows that trumpet and all those</text>
  <text start="391.729" dur="4.541">all those Jews who believe in Yahshua</text>
  <text start="394.62" dur="4.89">covered by his love and obey his word</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="4.21">and all those non-jews who believe in</text>
  <text start="399.51" dur="2.08">Yahshua covered by</text>
  <text start="400.48" dur="2.85">blood and obey his word will be</text>
  <text start="401.59" dur="3.87">resurrected and caught up to be with him</text>
  <text start="403.33" dur="4.14">that is when the reuniting of the two</text>
  <text start="405.46" dur="3.66">sticks will occur but this organization</text>
  <text start="407.47" dur="3.9">wants to try to take it into their own</text>
  <text start="409.12" dur="4.38">hands and bring it about themselves it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="411.37" dur="3.87">a false free gathering and here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="413.5" dur="3.9">so insidious is you continue to read</text>
  <text start="415.24" dur="3.21">this story and it sounds all wonderful</text>
  <text start="417.4" dur="3.42">and good I mean it&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="418.45" dur="4.38">Christians moving to Israel and joining</text>
  <text start="420.82" dur="4.53">with the Jews and the Jews are accepting</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="6.21">them but as you begin to read in this</text>
  <text start="425.35" dur="9.81">story I&amp;#39;m going to go ahead and find the</text>
  <text start="429.04" dur="7.56">actual statement it says ah si Hine</text>
  <text start="435.16" dur="3.45">Souter our representative from</text>
  <text start="436.6" dur="4.2">Switzerland explained to breaking Israel</text>
  <text start="438.61" dur="4.08">news that Benet Ephraim do not consider</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="3.6">themselves to be Christians the B&amp;#39;nai</text>
  <text start="442.69" dur="3.54">Efrain believe that Jesus or Yeshua as</text>
  <text start="444.4" dur="4.38">they call them is the way to return to</text>
  <text start="446.23" dur="4.86">Israel so again these are believers who</text>
  <text start="448.78" dur="4.83">are returning to the Hebrew to the faith</text>
  <text start="451.09" dur="4.47">for those who have strayed as such a</text>
  <text start="453.61" dur="4.47">connection to Jesus to Yeshua is</text>
  <text start="455.56" dur="4.77">absolutely not relevant to Jews who</text>
  <text start="458.08" dur="4.02">never strayed okay so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.33" dur="4.53">saying is the Jewish people do not need</text>
  <text start="462.1" dur="6.03">Yahshua this is Antichrist this is</text>
  <text start="464.86" dur="6.9">completely and totally Antichrist and</text>
  <text start="468.13" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s theirs - Antichrist spirits that</text>
  <text start="471.76" dur="4.35">are that are that are that are happening</text>
  <text start="474.13" dur="3.81">here there&amp;#39;s on the Jewish side they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="476.11" dur="3.63">saying oh we can try to keep the</text>
  <text start="477.94" dur="3.78">commandments but we don&amp;#39;t need Yahshua</text>
  <text start="479.74" dur="3.78">we don&amp;#39;t need the the Messiah we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="481.72" dur="5.13">need his blood and then on the Christian</text>
  <text start="483.52" dur="4.62">side they say oh yeah we love Yeshua we</text>
  <text start="486.85" dur="2.64">love Yahshua but we don&amp;#39;t need his</text>
  <text start="488.14" dur="2.58">Commandments and so it&amp;#39;s those two</text>
  <text start="489.49" dur="3.33">Antichrist spirits that going to be</text>
  <text start="490.72" dur="4.8">joining together particularly as this</text>
  <text start="492.82" dur="3.57">third temple gets rebuilt so this is the</text>
