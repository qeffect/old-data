  <text start="92.13" dur="4.83">abortion ban with no exceptions for rape</text>
  <text start="94.29" dur="4.77">or incest so I talked about how last</text>
  <text start="96.96" dur="3.72">week this passed through the house and</text>
  <text start="99.06" dur="3.239">then it got to the Senate and they made</text>
  <text start="100.68" dur="3.54">this amendment where they took away the</text>
  <text start="102.299" dur="3.661">exception for rape and incest which I</text>
  <text start="104.22" dur="4.469">was like wow hallelujah this is</text>
  <text start="105.96" dur="5.49">wonderful because no baby should be</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="4.5">murdered as a result of some something</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="2.669">evil that happened right I mean two</text>
  <text start="113.189" dur="2.671">wrongs don&amp;#39;t make a right</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="3.511">so they stripped us away and they</text>
  <text start="115.86" dur="4.619">weren&amp;#39;t sure at that point this was</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="5.37">going to pass but it did pass it did</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="5.131">pass Alabama Alabama back passes bill</text>
  <text start="123" dur="5.25">outlawing nearly all abortions including</text>
  <text start="125.61" dur="4.379">those in rape cases under the bill the</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="4.14">only exceptions are to safeguard the</text>
  <text start="129.989" dur="2.891">health of the mother the twenty five to</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="1.84">six</text>
  <text start="132.88" dur="4.23">makes it the most restrictive</text>
  <text start="134.23" dur="5.31">anti-abortion I&amp;#39;ll call it an tyent</text>
  <text start="137.11" dur="4.05">murder measure passed since pro-life</text>
  <text start="139.54" dur="5.64">campaigners were defeated in the roe v--</text>
  <text start="141.16" dur="5.97">wade case in 1973 alabama lawmakers</text>
  <text start="145.18" dur="4.11">passed a bill on tuesday banning nearly</text>
  <text start="147.13" dur="4.8">all abortions including those in rape</text>
  <text start="149.29" dur="4.32">and incest cases the twenty five to six</text>
  <text start="151.93" dur="4.29">vote makes it the most restrictive</text>
  <text start="153.61" dur="4.14">anti-abortion measure that ruling stated</text>
  <text start="156.22" dur="3.12">that the private and women of the right</text>
  <text start="157.75" dur="4.44">to an abortion except to save the</text>
  <text start="159.34" dur="5.55">mother&amp;#39;s life was unconstitutional under</text>
  <text start="162.19" dur="5.21">the alabama bill the only exceptions are</text>
  <text start="164.89" dur="5.34">to safeguard the health of the mother</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="5.47">let&amp;#39;s see the bill will now go before</text>
  <text start="170.23" dur="4.47">Republican governor and Kay IV who</text>
  <text start="172.87" dur="3.75">despite not having publicly committed to</text>
  <text start="174.7" dur="4.05">sign the legislation is seen as strongly</text>
  <text start="176.62" dur="4.95">opposed to abortion and is expected to</text>
  <text start="178.75" dur="4.71">sign the bill into law the law would</text>
  <text start="181.57" dur="4.2">take effect six months after being</text>
  <text start="183.46" dur="5.1">signed but of course it&amp;#39;s certain to</text>
  <text start="185.77" dur="4.14">face a legal challenge yeah well we know</text>
  <text start="188.56" dur="3.66">that the legal challenge is going to</text>
  <text start="189.91" dur="4.68">come and again the point of this</text>
  <text start="192.22" dur="3.99">legislation is so that it will be</text>
  <text start="194.59" dur="2.85">challenged and it will be challenged all</text>
  <text start="196.21" dur="3.36">the way up to the highest court of the</text>
  <text start="197.44" dur="3.69">land in the Supreme Court where we are</text>
  <text start="199.57" dur="3.09">hoping that roe v wade will be</text>
  <text start="201.13" dur="3.57">overturned and then this issue will get</text>
  <text start="202.66" dur="3.9">kicked back to the states and so then</text>
  <text start="204.7" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;ll start seeing certain states that</text>
  <text start="206.56" dur="4.14">will become actively pro-life like</text>
  <text start="208.54" dur="4.35">Alabama and then you&amp;#39;ll see other states</text>
  <text start="210.7" dur="6.03">that will continue in their pro death</text>
  <text start="212.89" dur="5.19">march in baby murder and so I think</text>
  <text start="216.73" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="218.08" dur="6.84">play out but I just I wanted to talk</text>
  <text start="221.65" dur="7.02">about the story because I love Alabama</text>
  <text start="224.92" dur="6.87">I love Alabama hallelujah and praise</text>
  <text start="228.67" dur="5.81">y&amp;#39;all for these brave senators who put</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="6">that amendment in there to strip away</text>
  <text start="234.48" dur="4.84">rape an incensed as as a festive</text>
  <text start="237.79" dur="6.51">justification to build a murder a baby</text>
  <text start="239.32" dur="6.87">it&amp;#39;s not never is again I still have</text>
  <text start="244.3" dur="3.96">that I don&amp;#39;t have that graphic I used to</text>
  <text start="246.19" dur="4.38">have this graphic where it showed a</text>
  <text start="248.26" dur="4.65">woman a woman&amp;#39;s body with her belly and</text>
  <text start="250.57" dur="3.63">it showed a baby inside and it had an</text>
  <text start="252.91" dur="3.81">arrow that pointed to the woman&amp;#39;s body</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="5.07">and then pointed to the baby and show</text>
  <text start="256.72" dur="4.86">that the baby is not part of the woman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.27" dur="5.69">body a baby he&amp;#39;s an independent human</text>
  <text start="261.58" dur="5.929">being and that mother is now in charge</text>
  <text start="264.96" dur="3.989">stewarding and protecting that baby but</text>
