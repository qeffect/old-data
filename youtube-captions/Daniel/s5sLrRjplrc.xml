  <text start="52.68" dur="6.899">keep torah this is probably one of my</text>
  <text start="56.82" dur="5.85">most important messages because this is</text>
  <text start="59.579" dur="5.01">the route and crux of why we get into</text>
  <text start="62.67" dur="4.86">the torah why do we wear the ZZ why do</text>

  <text start="81.869" dur="11.011">Torah and the first place of course I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="87.78" dur="6.78">going to go to is psalm 119 because if</text>
  <text start="92.88" dur="5.16">you go through psalm 119 which is the</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="7.05">longest Psalm in the entire Bible you</text>
  <text start="98.04" dur="6.329">will find that in those 176 verses David</text>
  <text start="101.61" dur="6.84">repeats something over and over and over</text>
  <text start="104.369" dur="7.471">again and the one thing that he repeats</text>
  <text start="108.45" dur="6.3">over and over again for all 176 verses</text>
  <text start="111.84" dur="5.279">of the longest Psalm in the Bible is how</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="4.439">much he loves the Torah how much he</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="6.18">delights in the law how much he loves</text>
  <text start="119.189" dur="7.591">the commandments why because it brings a</text>
  <text start="123.299" dur="7.32">smile to your face it brings a smile to</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="6.69">your face it is really that simple the</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="3.281">only thing that drives us in keeping his</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="3.67">command</text>
  <text start="133.9" dur="5.22">is to bring the light to his heart it</text>
  <text start="137.14" dur="4.049">has nothing to do with whether or not we</text>
  <text start="139.12" dur="5.91">wind up in heaven it has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="141.189" dur="5.13">with the rewards we get although many</text>
  <text start="145.03" dur="3.239">rewards are promised to those who</text>
  <text start="146.319" dur="6.39">diligently keep his Commandments it has</text>
  <text start="148.269" dur="6.181">nothing to do with you know how wise it</text>
  <text start="152.709" dur="3.75">will make you although wisdom is</text>
  <text start="154.45" dur="4.349">promised in fact there&amp;#39;s a promise in</text>
  <text start="156.459" dur="3.961">psalm 119 that says that those who keep</text>
  <text start="158.799" dur="3.541">his Commandments will become wiser than</text>
  <text start="160.42" dur="3.45">the ancients but it has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="162.34" dur="5.19">with any of that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.87" dur="5.729">really immaterial the only reason we</text>
  <text start="167.53" dur="4.47">keep the commandments the only reason we</text>
  <text start="169.599" dur="6.181">obey all the jots until throughout the</text>
  <text start="172" dur="8.06">Tanakh is quite simply to bring a smile</text>
  <text start="175.78" dur="7.65">to yas face that is the only reason and</text>
  <text start="180.06" dur="7.989">from genesis the time of Adam through</text>
  <text start="183.43" dur="7.399">Abraham through Moses and the giving of</text>
  <text start="188.049" dur="4.77">the Torah through the time of David and</text>
  <text start="190.829" dur="4.181">through the time of Daniel the prophet</text>
  <text start="192.819" dur="4.53">all the way through Ezra and Nehemiah</text>
  <text start="195.01" dur="4.8">down through Malachi through the</text>
  <text start="197.349" dur="4.021">Maccabean revolt all the way down to the</text>
  <text start="199.81" dur="3.63">first century where Yasha walked the</text>
  <text start="201.37" dur="4.32">earth and through Apostle Paul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.44" dur="4.71">writings and yoga Dawn&amp;#39;s revelation and</text>
  <text start="205.69" dur="5.729">all the way down through the ages to the</text>
  <text start="208.15" dur="7.44">year 2014 it has always been the same</text>
  <text start="211.419" dur="6.75">way to salvation and that is it is by</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="5.13">the blood of mushy och the blood of</text>
  <text start="218.169" dur="5.25">Messiah that washes away our passons and</text>
  <text start="220.72" dur="4.979">then by his Spirit that fills us at that</text>
  <text start="223.419" dur="5.04">point he gives us a new motive in our</text>
  <text start="225.699" dur="6.061">heart a new motive that that underlies</text>
  <text start="228.459" dur="5.4">everything we do and that new motive is</text>
  <text start="231.76" dur="5.55">we want to put a smile on our daddy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.859" dur="5.19">face you see before we get saved from</text>
  <text start="237.31" dur="3.69">our sins before we get justified we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="239.049" dur="4.59">primarily living for ourselves yeah we</text>
  <text start="241" dur="3.87">may do good things we may be moral or we</text>
  <text start="243.639" dur="3.541">may do good things for the people but</text>
  <text start="244.87" dur="5.67">but ultimately everything that we do is</text>
  <text start="247.18" dur="5.97">for ourselves it&amp;#39;s selfishness but what</text>
  <text start="250.54" dur="5.939">happens is is when Yahshua covers us in</text>
  <text start="253.15" dur="6.66">his blood and sets us free from our past</text>
  <text start="256.479" dur="6.481">sins and fills of the spirit that that</text>
  <text start="259.81" dur="5.25">according to Ezekiel 11 19 to 28 causes</text>
  <text start="262.96" dur="3.81">us to walk in his Commandments and</text>
  <text start="265.06" dur="4.199">statutes</text>
  <text start="266.77" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s because he&amp;#39;s changed the very root</text>
  <text start="269.259" dur="4.891">of our heart because there&amp;#39;s no longer I</text>
  <text start="271.96" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s driving our hearts as it was</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="4.259">before we met him but now it is Yahshua</text>
  <text start="276.61" dur="4.64">who&amp;#39;s literally dwelling in the center</text>
  <text start="278.409" dur="5.461">of our hearts and our every motive our</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="4.81">every thought is how can we please him</text>
  <text start="283.87" dur="5.519">when we get up in the morning how can we</text>
  <text start="286.06" dur="4.44">please yah when we go throughout our day</text>
  <text start="289.389" dur="2.851">and we&amp;#39;re doing whatever we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="3.93">whether it&amp;#39;s grocery shopping or working</text>
  <text start="292.24" dur="5.519">or evangelizing or whatever it is</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="4.59">cooking how can i please my daddy how</text>
  <text start="297.759" dur="3.84">can I get to know him more how can I</text>
  <text start="299.02" dur="3.929">become more intimate with them one of</text>
  <text start="301.599" dur="2.94">the wonderful things about keeping the</text>
  <text start="302.949" dur="5.22">Torah is that every commandment and</text>
  <text start="304.539" dur="8.041">Torah brings us closer to him it</text>
  <text start="308.169" dur="6.631">increases our intimacy with him because</text>
  <text start="312.58" dur="4.589">the Torah was never meant to save us the</text>
  <text start="314.8" dur="4.41">Torah were always instructions that came</text>
  <text start="317.169" dur="5.461">to us after our heart has been changed</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="5.549">we see this in the time of Moses because</text>
  <text start="322.63" dur="4.8">we see that the children of Israel went</text>
  <text start="324.759" dur="5.34">through the Red Sea they were baptized</text>
  <text start="327.43" dur="4.32">in the Red Sea as Paul says and then</text>
  <text start="330.099" dur="4.201">they came to Mount Sinai so see they</text>
  <text start="331.75" dur="4.53">were saved first from the sin of Egypt</text>
  <text start="334.3" dur="3.78">and then they were given the Torah the</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="4.53">instructions and it&amp;#39;s the same way today</text>
  <text start="338.08" dur="4.829">we get saved from our sin first we get</text>
  <text start="340.81" dur="6.539">washed in his blood we get baptized he</text>
  <text start="342.909" dur="7.5">justifies us and then then we now have</text>
  <text start="347.349" dur="6.6">the motive that we need that is to keep</text>
  <text start="350.409" dur="5.551">Torah out of a love for him and these</text>
  <text start="353.949" dur="4.59">instructions once we have that heart</text>
  <text start="355.96" dur="5.63">change these instructions now help us to</text>
  <text start="358.539" dur="5.551">get closer and closer and closer to him</text>
  <text start="361.59" dur="4.09">see if we don&amp;#39;t have that initial heart</text>
  <text start="364.09" dur="3.78">change if we&amp;#39;re not completely and</text>
  <text start="365.68" dur="3.599">totally sold out for him then the torrid</text>
  <text start="367.87" dur="3.63">really is not going to do us any good</text>
  <text start="369.279" dur="5.161">it&amp;#39;s not because it the tour is not</text>
  <text start="371.5" dur="4.979">designed for sinners or for hypocrites</text>
  <text start="374.44" dur="4.02">except to convict them of their sin</text>
  <text start="376.479" dur="5.611">that&amp;#39;s the only thing the Torah can do</text>
  <text start="378.46" dur="4.98">to a sinner or hypocrite that&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="382.09" dur="3.72">thing the Torah can do to a heart that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.44" dur="5.159">not in love with Yas just simply condemn</text>
  <text start="385.81" dur="5.579">and convict that&amp;#39;s altura can do but</text>
  <text start="388.599" dur="5.341">once yoshua has set us free and changed</text>
  <text start="391.389" dur="5.041">our hearts then the Torah takes on a</text>
  <text start="393.94" dur="4.709">whole new meaning because now that very</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="3.78">tour that once condemned us and once</text>
  <text start="398.649" dur="3.901">pointed out what was wrong</text>
  <text start="400.21" dur="4.739">all we can approach that Torah with joy</text>
  <text start="402.55" dur="4.92">and say okay how can I keep this Torah</text>
  <text start="404.949" dur="5.101">so I can please yah and then as we do</text>
  <text start="407.47" dur="5.16">the Torah it brings us closer and closer</text>
  <text start="410.05" dur="5.31">to him it increases our intimacy with</text>
  <text start="412.63" dur="3.96">him now some Christians may scoff at</text>
  <text start="415.36" dur="3.059">this and they say well how does you know</text>
  <text start="416.59" dur="4.62">wearing a pair of ZZ brings me closer to</text>
  <text start="418.419" dur="5.041">Christ or following some of these</text>
  <text start="421.21" dur="3.329">esoteric laws like wearing clothing</text>
  <text start="423.46" dur="3.03">alone because how does that bring me</text>
  <text start="424.539" dur="5.85">closer to Christ I&amp;#39;m telling you from</text>
  <text start="426.49" dur="6.899">experience every single commandment once</text>
  <text start="430.389" dur="6.87">you apply it and do it brings you closer</text>
  <text start="433.389" dur="5.731">to Christ for example the zeit zeit I</text>
  <text start="437.259" dur="3.271">mean you put them on and at first it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="439.12" dur="2.79">like okay I&amp;#39;ll put them on people going</text>
  <text start="440.53" dur="3.479">to think I&amp;#39;m weird or whatever but as</text>
  <text start="441.91" dur="4.71">you put them on and you see them every</text>
  <text start="444.009" dur="4.891">day it should compel you to want to</text>
  <text start="446.62" dur="3.87">study about them and as you study about</text>
  <text start="448.9" dur="3.06">them you begin to realize the utter</text>
  <text start="450.49" dur="5.13">richness of what the zeit zeit</text>
  <text start="451.96" dur="5.82">symbolizes that they were first of</text>
  <text start="455.62" dur="4.5">course commanded for us to wear to to</text>
  <text start="457.78" dur="4.77">remind us to keep the commandments but</text>
  <text start="460.12" dur="4.26">then we learned that Yahshua in the</text>
  <text start="462.55" dur="3.899">Gospels when he was wearing these easy</text>
  <text start="464.38" dur="4.56">that woman who had that issue of blood</text>
  <text start="466.449" dur="4.861">for 12 years she grabbed ahold of</text>
  <text start="468.94" dur="4.74">Yahshua ZZ because she had the faith to</text>
  <text start="471.31" dur="6.69">press in and grab a hold of his easy and</text>
  <text start="473.68" dur="5.729">she was healed and of course if you go</text>
  <text start="478" dur="3.599">to the Psalms you find out that there is</text>
  <text start="479.409" dur="5.181">healing in Yahweh&amp;#39;s wings that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.599" dur="7.341">repeated in several different songs &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="484.59" dur="6.759">zeet zeet are worn like wings I have a</text>
  <text start="488.94" dur="3.729">podcast that I made the last October</text>
  <text start="491.349" dur="3.87">about how to make zeit zeit how to wear</text>
  <text start="492.669" dur="4.321">them according to the Torah they</text>
  <text start="495.219" dur="4.44">literally form wings around you for</text>
  <text start="496.99" dur="4.29">wings around you so you begin to learn</text>
  <text start="499.659" dur="3.421">the depth and the richness of just this</text>
  <text start="501.28" dur="3.78">one commandment and that&amp;#39;s just one and</text>
  <text start="503.08" dur="3.869">there&amp;#39;s you know some 600 odd</text>
  <text start="505.06" dur="3.57">Commandments in the Torah and every</text>
  <text start="506.949" dur="3.96">single one of them that we&amp;#39;re able to do</text>
  <text start="508.63" dur="4.589">in this modern-day culture brings us</text>
  <text start="510.909" dur="4.201">closer and closer Messiah so really the</text>
  <text start="513.219" dur="3.63">question isn&amp;#39;t like oh do I have to do</text>
  <text start="515.11" dur="3.179">this the question more is why would you</text>
  <text start="516.849" dur="3.57">not want to do this why would you not</text>
  <text start="518.289" dur="3.961">want to apply yourself to the Torah and</text>
  <text start="520.419" dur="3.631">do whatever you have to do to conform</text>
  <text start="522.25" dur="3.27">and change your life to it because all</text>
  <text start="524.05" dur="3.51">the commandments will do is bring you</text>
  <text start="525.52" dur="4.5">closer to him if you truly have a heart</text>
  <text start="527.56" dur="4.38">that sold out to Christ that just wants</text>
  <text start="530.02" dur="2.79">to put a smile on his face then you</text>
  <text start="531.94" dur="3">should naturally</text>
  <text start="532.81" dur="4.29">want to do his word now sometimes it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="534.94" dur="3.99">take a judgment because you know we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="537.1" dur="4.11">been raised in a Gentile culture and so</text>
  <text start="538.93" dur="3.33">you know keeping Sabbath day from Friday</text>
  <text start="541.21" dur="3.63">night to Saturday night is different</text>
  <text start="542.26" dur="4.35">from sunday and wearing these zeit zeit</text>
  <text start="544.84" dur="3.81">and you know eating kosher and all</text>
  <text start="546.61" dur="5.34">sevens it can be jarring because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.65" dur="5.189">such a cultural shock but when we</text>
  <text start="551.95" dur="4.23">realize that every time we do these</text>
  <text start="553.839" dur="5.431">commandments that puts a smile on the</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="5.67">Messiah&amp;#39;s face that should override any</text>
  <text start="559.27" dur="5.48">cultural shock or discomfort or whatever</text>
  <text start="561.85" dur="5.37">might happen when we simply want to come</text>
  <text start="564.75" dur="8.8">if we need to conform our lives to his</text>
  <text start="567.22" dur="8.67">will this has always been the case I</text>
  <text start="573.55" dur="5.13">mean if you study anyone from the time</text>
  <text start="575.89" dur="5.46">of Adam all the way till 2014 who&amp;#39;s ever</text>
  <text start="578.68" dur="3.96">been totally sold out to you the one</text>
  <text start="581.35" dur="2.88">motive that rules their heart and</text>
  <text start="582.64" dur="4.53">everything they do is that they they</text>
  <text start="584.23" dur="4.68">want to please yeah they want to please</text>
  <text start="587.17" dur="4.2">them and if that is the motive of your</text>
  <text start="588.91" dur="4.26">heart if that&amp;#39;s what Yash was done then</text>
  <text start="591.37" dur="6.63">you can do you can do anything in this</text>
  <text start="593.17" dur="10.05">book for him this is why in Deuteronomy</text>
  <text start="598" dur="6.87">chapter 30 starting in verse 11 this is</text>
  <text start="603.22" dur="5.43">at the very end of Deuteronomy after the</text>
  <text start="604.87" dur="5.82">entire tour has been givin Moses in</text>
  <text start="608.65" dur="3.95">summary says for this commandment he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="610.69" dur="4.32">actually referring to the entire Torah</text>

  <text start="637.75" dur="9.9">you may do it you may do the Torah now</text>
  <text start="645.49" dur="5.88">that passes is directly quoted by Paul</text>
  <text start="647.65" dur="7.53">in Romans chapter 10 except you know</text>
  <text start="651.37" dur="6.12">what Paul does Paul the brilliant master</text>
  <text start="655.18" dur="9.26">of Torah replaces the word Torah with</text>
  <text start="657.49" dur="6.95">Christ and so in Romans 10 we see this</text>
  <text start="664.55" dur="6.31">starting in verse 7 excuse me starting</text>
  <text start="668.76" dur="4.259">in verse 6 Romans 10 verse 6 but the</text>
  <text start="670.86" dur="4.05">righteousness of which is a faith speaks</text>
  <text start="673.019" dur="3.781">on this wise stand out in your heart who</text>
  <text start="674.91" dur="4.23">shall ascend into heaven that is to</text>
  <text start="676.8" dur="4.17">bring Messiah down from above or who</text>
  <text start="679.14" dur="4.53">shall descend into the deep that is to</text>
  <text start="680.97" dur="5.28">bring up Messiah again from the dead but</text>
  <text start="683.67" dur="4.38">what say if it the word is nigh you even</text>
  <text start="686.25" dur="4.73">in your mouth and in your heart that is</text>
  <text start="688.05" dur="5.15">the Word of Faith which we preach that</text>
  <text start="690.98" dur="5.109">if you will confess with your mouth</text>
  <text start="693.2" dur="4.3">Adonai Yahshua and shalt believe in your</text>
  <text start="696.089" dur="4.68">heart that Yahoo raised him from the</text>
  <text start="697.5" dur="6.12">dead you shall be saved so Paul takes</text>
  <text start="700.769" dur="6">the text of Deuteronomy 30 that says we</text>
  <text start="703.62" dur="4.98">can keep this entire Torah and then</text>
  <text start="706.769" dur="6.081">shows that the Torah keeping the Torah</text>
  <text start="708.6" dur="8.13">is equivalent to serve in Christ and</text>
  <text start="712.85" dur="5.41">basically gives us the passage with the</text>
  <text start="716.73" dur="5.31">deeper meaning of Christ right in the</text>
  <text start="718.26" dur="8.19">center of it Christ is the Torah clothed</text>
  <text start="722.04" dur="7.5">in flesh obeying the Torah out of a love</text>
  <text start="726.45" dur="5.22">for yah is equivalent to serving Yahshua</text>
  <text start="729.54" dur="6.45">that&amp;#39;s the point Paul&amp;#39;s making in Romans</text>
  <text start="731.67" dur="6.93">chapter 10 and why did we serve Christ</text>
  <text start="735.99" dur="6.5">why do we keep Torah to put a smile on</text>
  <text start="738.6" dur="6.72">Yas face to put a smile on y&amp;#39;all&amp;#39;s face</text>
  <text start="742.49" dur="6.19">we should be so grateful at what he did</text>
  <text start="745.32" dur="6.18">for us when He shed his blood on Calvary</text>
  <text start="748.68" dur="4.79">so grateful because we deserve all of us</text>
  <text start="751.5" dur="3.89">deserve a like a fire for the past</text>
  <text start="753.47" dur="3.729">transgressions that we&amp;#39;ve committed</text>
  <text start="755.39" dur="3.879">because there&amp;#39;s nothing we can do about</text>
  <text start="757.199" dur="3.63">that even if we chose from this point on</text>
  <text start="759.269" dur="2.731">and never sin again there&amp;#39;s nothing we</text>
  <text start="760.829" dur="5.311">can ever do about the bar past</text>
  <text start="762" dur="7.07">transgressions nothing their crimes they</text>
  <text start="766.14" dur="5.34">did the penalty is death eternal death</text>
  <text start="769.07" dur="4.78">but we should be so grateful that he has</text>
  <text start="771.48" dur="4.62">set us free from our past said it&amp;#39;s free</text>
  <text start="773.85" dur="5.25">from our past lives of sin that we</text>
  <text start="776.1" dur="4.56">should be willing willingly wanting to</text>
  <text start="779.1" dur="5.669">do whatever we can to put a smile on his</text>
  <text start="780.66" dur="5.63">face and the scripture is very clear</text>
  <text start="784.769" dur="6.18">that the way to put a smile on his face</text>
  <text start="786.29" dur="6.609">is by keeping the Torah even Jesus</text>
  <text start="790.949" dur="5.571">Christ of Nazareth even yash HaMashiach</text>
  <text start="792.899" dur="8.581">says this in Matthew chapter 5</text>
