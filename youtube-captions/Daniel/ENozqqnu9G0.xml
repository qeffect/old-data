  <text start="87.18" dur="7.5">the morning this very gross just vile</text>
  <text start="90.509" dur="8.551">sick dream was in my mind and all of a</text>
  <text start="94.68" dur="6.119">sudden yah told me what to do and I took</text>
  <text start="99.06" dur="4.83">authority over this devil that was</text>
  <text start="100.799" dur="5.311">trying to oppress me and I put it into</text>
  <text start="103.89" dur="3.63">everlasting chains reserved into</text>
  <text start="106.11" dur="3.509">everlasting darkness until the day of</text>
  <text start="107.52" dur="3.54">judgment I did that through the</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="4.86">authority and power that Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="111.06" dur="6.57">given me and immediately the the dream</text>
  <text start="114.479" dur="4.89">and the vision was gone and for many</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="5.07">months something since like last fall</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="5.57">I&amp;#39;ve had this pain in my right leg my</text>
  <text start="122.7" dur="6.63">right foot it&amp;#39;s been a bad pain and</text>

  <text start="130.46" dur="5.28">on and it&amp;#39;s been with me for months and</text>
  <text start="132.85" dur="3.97">I was just rejoicing because I was</text>
  <text start="135.74" dur="5.07">reminded of the verse where it says</text>
  <text start="136.82" dur="5.82">where Paul says every vain imagination</text>
  <text start="140.81" dur="3.51">that exalts itself so against ya you</text>
  <text start="142.64" dur="4.86">just supposed to rip down and tear down</text>
  <text start="144.32" dur="6">and and I was like hallelujah</text>
  <text start="147.5" dur="6.81">so Yahshua gave me this authority to do</text>
  <text start="150.32" dur="6.03">spiritual warfare and and so I wanted to</text>
  <text start="154.31" dur="4.05">share this with you so that you can do</text>
  <text start="156.35" dur="4.02">this as well that this is a technique</text>
  <text start="158.36" dur="4.53">that you can do and after I had done</text>
  <text start="160.37" dur="4.8">that I yo had me just speak out a</text>
  <text start="162.89" dur="4.68">proclamation and I said any devil any</text>
  <text start="165.17" dur="4.23">fallen angel any wicked entity that</text>
  <text start="167.57" dur="4.65">tries to come against me just be put on</text>
  <text start="169.4" dur="4.89">notice that through the power of yah he</text>
  <text start="172.22" dur="4.02">threw me will cause you to go into</text>
  <text start="174.29" dur="3.27">everlasting darkness and I put that</text>
  <text start="176.24" dur="4.35">warning out also for any Devils that</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="4.95">would mess with my friends and so I put</text>
  <text start="180.59" dur="3.6">that Proclamation out you know because</text>
  <text start="182.51" dur="3.36">it you know it says Michael the</text>
  <text start="184.19" dur="4.05">Archangel said that he doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="185.87" dur="3.87">rebuke Satan but he says yah rebuke you</text>

  <text start="198.32" dur="4.14">that I can trample the devil&amp;#39;s underfoot</text>
  <text start="200.39" dur="5.16">the scorpions and the adders and the and</text>
