  <text start="266.43" dur="3.359">they&amp;#39;re beginning to see a change in the</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="3.81">way DHS is responding to their audits</text>
  <text start="269.789" dur="4.201">and a change in the way DHS is seeking</text>

  <text start="298.52" dur="7.62">her home on six 419 so two days ago she</text>
  <text start="302.45" dur="6.36">was working with DHS insider to expose a</text>
  <text start="306.14" dur="5.82">missing 27 while this article says 28</text>

  <text start="311.96" dur="6.15">Protective Services</text>
  <text start="313.78" dur="6.16">so we&amp;#39;re talk about CPS here these funds</text>
  <text start="318.11" dur="3.51">are being placed through trade and the</text>
  <text start="319.94" dur="4.08">dividends are being filtered back to the</text>
  <text start="321.62" dur="4.53">Clinton Foundation or owned shell</text>
  <text start="324.02" dur="5.16">companies belonging to the Clinton</text>

  <text start="329.18" dur="5.01">discovered when it was revealed that the</text>
  <text start="331.94" dur="5.04">DHS and Arkansas had two separate sets</text>
  <text start="334.19" dur="4.71">of books it&amp;#39;s connected to a federal</text>
  <text start="336.98" dur="4.47">grant that requires a specific number of</text>
  <text start="338.9" dur="4.92">children be removed from their families</text>
  <text start="341.45" dur="4.47">to meet the required quota so that</text>
  <text start="343.82" dur="4.55">they&amp;#39;re able to renew the grant again</text>
  <text start="345.92" dur="5.74">each year</text>
  <text start="348.37" dur="6.63">so not just not just some sort of</text>
  <text start="351.66" dur="5.65">monetary discrepancy going on within the</text>
  <text start="355" dur="7.47">child&amp;#39;s Protective Services but actually</text>
  <text start="357.31" dur="7.26">shows that they the whole purpose of the</text>

  <text start="364.57" dur="4.319">at least we&amp;#39;ve known about them from</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="4.509">YouTube videos and other people talking</text>
  <text start="368.889" dur="4.381">about it but here was hard proof that</text>
  <text start="371.139" dur="4.411">there was actually quotas that were</text>
  <text start="373.27" dur="4.11">being required for children to be</text>
  <text start="375.55" dur="3.96">removed from their families and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="377.38" dur="3.45">talked many many times about how CPS</text>
  <text start="379.51" dur="4.2">child protective services is a</text>
  <text start="380.83" dur="3.899">completely corrupt and rogue agency that</text>
  <text start="383.71" dur="3.929">needs to be completely and totally</text>
  <text start="384.729" dur="4.231">disbanded because it&amp;#39;s not doing what it</text>
  <text start="387.639" dur="3.211">was intended to do it&amp;#39;s supposed to</text>
  <text start="388.96" dur="3.66">protect children right instead it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.85" dur="4.19">actually taking children out of families</text>
  <text start="392.62" dur="5.97">where children should not be removed all</text>

  <text start="457.17" dur="6.68">course most of you know John Durham is</text>
  <text start="460.17" dur="7.29">the person that is basically going to be</text>
  <text start="463.85" dur="5.44">going after looking at the Russian</text>
  <text start="467.46" dur="5.54">collusion hoax that he has been assigned</text>

  <text start="478.56" dur="5.46">going after the CIA and going after the</text>
  <text start="481.14" dur="6.12">FBI and it looks like Christopher Steele</text>
  <text start="484.02" dur="5.85">is going to basically testify and prove</text>
  <text start="487.26" dur="4.56">at the FBI live and this is why Jodie is</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="6.299">out there saying the walls are closing</text>
  <text start="491.82" dur="6.33">in on the deep state so we really need</text>

  <text start="506.82" dur="4.68">it looks like it&amp;#39;s going to be happening</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="5.85">very very soon now the big news of</text>
  <text start="511.5" dur="4.44">course also is that YouTube announced</text>
  <text start="513.96" dur="3.42">they were gonna try to remove thousands</text>
  <text start="515.94" dur="6.93">and thousands of videos that did not</text>
  <text start="517.38" dur="11.13">align with their policy and Q has warned</text>
  <text start="522.87" dur="9.94">us about this if we go to Q post 2793</text>
  <text start="528.51" dur="7">and he actually says</text>
  <text start="532.81" dur="5.28">this occur immediate steps will be taken</text>
  <text start="535.51" dur="4.89">to classify each as I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="538.09" dur="4.59">the social media platforms each as a</text>
  <text start="540.4" dur="4.71">public utility essential public services</text>
  <text start="542.68" dur="5.07">to gain appropriate government</text>
  <text start="545.11" dur="4.83">regulation and control why do we make</text>
  <text start="547.75" dur="5.97">things public and you make things public</text>
  <text start="549.94" dur="7.2">in order to force accountability right</text>
  <text start="553.72" dur="5.73">now YouTube Google all these platforms</text>
  <text start="557.14" dur="4.56">are privately owned and because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="559.45" dur="4.11">privately owned they have the discretion</text>
  <text start="561.7" dur="6.09">to do what they want which means that</text>
  <text start="563.56" dur="6.51">they can if they want cut off half of</text>
  <text start="567.79" dur="3.96">the people in the United States who</text>
  <text start="570.07" dur="5.28">might have a certain view that they</text>
  <text start="571.75" dur="7.71">disagree with and censor and take them</text>
  <text start="575.35" dur="8.04">off so this Q post of 2793 was posted</text>
  <text start="579.46" dur="8.04">back in February 18th of 2019 this was a</text>
  <text start="583.39" dur="7.65">a post that shows us that Q the Patriots</text>
  <text start="587.5" dur="5.1">they have a plan they have a response if</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="4.549">this should ever happen so I think this</text>
  <text start="592.6" dur="6.86">might be what the whole antitrust</text>
  <text start="595.589" dur="8.581">investigation is leaning toward that</text>
  <text start="599.46" dur="6.87">President Trump is going to cause these</text>
  <text start="604.17" dur="6.07">platforms to become public utilities</text>
  <text start="606.33" dur="7.57">like like electricity so that it can no</text>
  <text start="610.24" dur="6.03">longer be used to stifle freedom of</text>
  <text start="613.9" dur="3.689">speech so I don&amp;#39;t so we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="616.27" dur="2.97">happens we&amp;#39;ll see we&amp;#39;ll see how this</text>
  <text start="617.589" dur="4.551">this plays out</text>
  <text start="619.24" dur="6.75">it&amp;#39;ll be very very interesting or meny</text>
  <text start="622.14" dur="5.32">maybe these social media giants will get</text>
