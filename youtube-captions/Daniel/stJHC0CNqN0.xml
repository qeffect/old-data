  <text start="0" dur="7.29">sorry I got cut off this is part 2 of</text>
  <text start="2.72" dur="11.079">this Shabbat day a podcast for November</text>
  <text start="7.29" dur="7.769">9 2013 Rieger my 17 and it talks about</text>
  <text start="13.799" dur="4.411">how people are walking in the</text>
  <text start="15.059" dur="4.38">imaginations of their hearts and I spoke</text>
  <text start="18.21" dur="3">about this a little bit during the Skype</text>
  <text start="19.439" dur="3.271">meeting but basically that you know they</text>
  <text start="21.21" dur="3.21">thought they were keeping Torah they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="22.71" dur="3.27">really keeping their own oral traditions</text>
  <text start="24.42" dur="4.019">and sort of mixing it in with Torah but</text>
  <text start="25.98" dur="4.35">they thought they were keeping Torah but</text>
  <text start="28.439" dur="3.691">they were actually walking after the</text>
  <text start="30.33" dur="3.33">imaginations of their hearts because the</text>
  <text start="32.13" dur="4.17">prophets and the priests and the people</text>
  <text start="33.66" dur="3.72">in Judah basically we&amp;#39;re doing what they</text>
  <text start="36.3" dur="2.91">thought was right what they thought</text>
  <text start="37.38" dur="3.21">Yahweh was telling them but it had no</text>
  <text start="39.21" dur="2.73">root in the word and Jeremiah then</text>
  <text start="40.59" dur="3.239">confronts them about for instance the</text>
  <text start="41.94" dur="4.59">Sabbath day says you guys are bringing</text>
  <text start="43.829" dur="4.291">in burdens into the gates on Sabbath and</text>
  <text start="46.53" dur="3.48">you ought not to be doing this usual to</text>
  <text start="48.12" dur="3.66">keep the Shabbat but of course they have</text>
  <text start="50.01" dur="2.91">their justifications but why they were</text>
  <text start="51.78" dur="3.93">doing it and they still thought they</text>
  <text start="52.92" dur="3.869">were keeping Sabbath so you know Angelo</text>
  <text start="55.71" dur="3.419">and Alicia they have their</text>
  <text start="56.789" dur="4.561">justifications but when you look at what</text>
  <text start="59.129" dur="5.041">the Holy Spirit tells them it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="61.35" dur="4.71">match up with the word okay and and this</text>
  <text start="64.17" dur="4.32">does not just go with Angela or Alicia I</text>
  <text start="66.06" dur="3.9">have to make sure I when i hear yah</text>
  <text start="68.49" dur="4.26">speaking to me i have to make sure okay</text>
  <text start="69.96" dur="4.26">is this yah and I have to hear what he</text>
  <text start="72.75" dur="3.57">says and then I got to compare it to</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="3.99">what the Holy Bible says and if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="76.32" dur="3.57">a discrepancy and say okay that&amp;#39;s not yo</text>
  <text start="78.21" dur="3.93">speaking to me that&amp;#39;s some devil trying</text>
  <text start="79.89" dur="5.64">to impersonate the voice of yah trying</text>
  <text start="82.14" dur="6.299">to act like the Shepherd of Israel the</text>
  <text start="85.53" dur="5.76">Bible has to be the standard okay and</text>
  <text start="88.439" dur="4.441">and and when a voice says something that</text>
  <text start="91.29" dur="3.3">doesn&amp;#39;t match up with the word then you</text>
  <text start="92.88" dur="6.09">know it&amp;#39;s not yeah it&amp;#39;s a very simple</text>
  <text start="94.59" dur="6.779">test now Angelo i mean he he texted me</text>
  <text start="98.97" dur="5.64">by rebuking me and then saying don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="101.369" dur="4.951">respond that&amp;#39;s not charity whenever</text>
  <text start="104.61" dur="3.09">there&amp;#39;s no example in scripture where</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="4.17">someone rebukes someone and then just</text>
  <text start="107.7" dur="5.099">cuts them off okay whenever you rebuke</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="4.32">someone in love you are wait for their</text>
  <text start="112.799" dur="4.951">response that&amp;#39;s a loving thing to do you</text>
  <text start="114.81" dur="4.68">hope all things so when Angelo texted me</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="4.229">yesterday and I have proof on my phone</text>
  <text start="119.49" dur="4.32">still and he rebuked me and said don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="121.979" dur="3.96">ever call me content me don&amp;#39;t respond to</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="3.96">this it&amp;#39;s because he was scared of my</text>
  <text start="125.939" dur="3.871">response he wasn&amp;#39;t operating in love in</text>
  <text start="127.77" dur="3.42">first Corinthians 13 love you operating</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="2.91">in the spirit of fear and wickedness</text>
  <text start="131.19" dur="3.63">that he&amp;#39;s allowed to control him</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="4.86">so again he listens to a voice that</text>
  <text start="134.82" dur="4.14">doesn&amp;#39;t match up with scripture in this</text>
  <text start="137.58" dur="4.86">case it doesn&amp;#39;t match up with first</text>
  <text start="138.96" dur="5.43">Corinthians 13 biblical love and then of</text>
  <text start="142.44" dur="4.26">course Alicia had the issue with the</text>
  <text start="144.39" dur="4.98">first Corinthians 11 first Thessalonians</text>
  <text start="146.7" dur="5.4">5 17 so it&amp;#39;s very important body of</text>
  <text start="149.37" dur="5.18">Messiah that we discern and make sure</text>
  <text start="152.1" dur="4.86">that the voice we&amp;#39;re listening to is</text>
  <text start="154.55" dur="5.56">actually Yahshua and it will match and</text>
  <text start="156.96" dur="4.74">confirm in his word now angela was</text>
  <text start="160.11" dur="3.06">trying to tell me well you know I know</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="3">alicia has to be right because she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.17" dur="5.039">confirmed so many of my words in the</text>
  <text start="164.7" dur="5.88">past look jeremiah 17 says don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="168.209" dur="5.851">in men or women for that matter trust in</text>
  <text start="170.58" dur="5.04">yarm trust in his word guys we don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="174.06" dur="4.38">to other people looking for</text>
  <text start="175.62" dur="4.79">confirmations we go to his word and then</text>
  <text start="178.44" dur="4.95">if somebody else happens to confirm it</text>
  <text start="180.41" dur="5.2">great but his word should be the first</text>
  <text start="183.39" dur="5.819">confirmation that the Holy Bible Genesis</text>
  <text start="185.61" dur="5.82">to Revelation some of you charismatic</text>
  <text start="189.209" dur="3.391">you know so-called holy spirit filled</text>
  <text start="191.43" dur="3.39">Christians need to get a little more</text>
  <text start="192.6" dur="5.25">Baptist and you know get back to the</text>
  <text start="194.82" dur="4.56">word but you know again the only reason</text>
  <text start="197.85" dur="3.03">I exposed Angelo and Alicia in</text>
  <text start="199.38" dur="3.15">particular is because they do have these</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="4.02">so-called ministries where they impact a</text>
  <text start="202.53" dur="5.429">lot of people and I love the flock too</text>
