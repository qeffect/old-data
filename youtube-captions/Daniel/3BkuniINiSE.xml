  <text start="20.369" dur="6">series in reconciling Messiah and</text>
  <text start="23.43" dur="5.88">Apostle Paul&amp;#39;s teachings this is</text>
  <text start="26.369" dur="5.881">entitled Colossians 2 blotting out what</text>
  <text start="29.31" dur="6.78">New Moon Sabbath&amp;#39;s and clean food to</text>
  <text start="32.25" dur="6.149">this passage written by Paul many many</text>
  <text start="36.09" dur="8.699">years after the resurrection to the</text>
  <text start="38.399" dur="9.301">believers in colossi these this passage</text>
  <text start="44.789" dur="5.011">has been used so much by Christians to</text>
  <text start="47.7" dur="3.81">say oh look we don&amp;#39;t have to do the</text>
  <text start="49.8" dur="5.31">Sabbath&amp;#39;s or the new or observe the New</text>
  <text start="51.51" dur="5.97">Moon&amp;#39;s or II cleaned because don&amp;#39;t judge</text>
  <text start="55.11" dur="4.65">so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s take the whole context</text>
  <text start="57.48" dur="4.77">because again that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s so important</text>
  <text start="59.76" dur="3.869">this is what Peter warns about in 2nd</text>
  <text start="62.25" dur="3.72">Peter where he says remember there will</text>
  <text start="63.629" dur="4.231">be men unstable in the faith who will</text>
  <text start="65.97" dur="2.49">twist Paul&amp;#39;s words to their own</text>
  <text start="67.86" dur="2.64">destruction</text>
  <text start="68.46" dur="4.43">so let&amp;#39;s look at what Paul&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="70.5" dur="5.549">saying look at the entire context and</text>
  <text start="72.89" dur="5.08">we&amp;#39;ll see actually that what Christians</text>
  <text start="76.049" dur="4.561">think pulsing actually it&amp;#39;s the very</text>
  <text start="77.97" dur="6.899">opposite Paul is actually upholding the</text>
  <text start="80.61" dur="10.38">Torah so we&amp;#39;re going to start in verse</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="9.54">verse 13 of Colossians chapter 2 and it</text>
  <text start="90.99" dur="6.48">says and you being dead in your sins and</text>
  <text start="94.409" dur="4.621">the uncircumcision of your flesh happy</text>
  <text start="97.47" dur="4.02">quickened together with them having</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="5.159">forgiven you all trespasses now remember</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="6.57">we know what sin is it&amp;#39;s defined in 1st</text>
  <text start="104.189" dur="6.241">John 3 4 Bibles us go there real quickly</text>
  <text start="108.06" dur="5.61">first John 3:4 says whosoever commits</text>
  <text start="110.43" dur="6.57">sin transgresses also the Torah for sin</text>
  <text start="113.67" dur="5.28">is the transgression of the Torah so</text>
  <text start="117" dur="3.719">yeah as purchase from our transgressions</text>
  <text start="118.95" dur="4.379">of the Torah through his son Yahshua</text>
  <text start="120.719" dur="5.221">HaMashiach that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s done he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.329" dur="5.561">forgiven us of all those trespasses</text>
  <text start="125.94" dur="5.08">blotting out so this is verse 14</text>
  <text start="128.89" dur="4.65">blotting out the handwriting of</text>
  <text start="131.02" dur="6.66">Ordinances that was against us which was</text>
  <text start="133.54" dur="8.55">contrary to us and took out of the way</text>
  <text start="137.68" dur="6.36">nailing it to his cross and having</text>
  <text start="142.09" dur="3.83">spoiled principalities and powers he</text>
  <text start="144.04" dur="4.95">made a show of them openly triumphing</text>
  <text start="145.92" dur="5.2">triumphing over them in it so this is</text>
  <text start="148.99" dur="4.14">where we get hung up here so Christians</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="4.08">will point to verse 13 say look he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.13" dur="3.69">blotted out those ordinances he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.2" dur="3.03">blotted out that Torah so we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="156.82" dur="3.63">to keep it anymore it was contrary to us</text>
  <text start="158.23" dur="3.66">but not to keep it anymore okay that is</text>
  <text start="160.45" dur="3.6">clearly not what it&amp;#39;s saying remember</text>
  <text start="161.89" dur="2.79">the Torah says thou shalt not commit</text>
  <text start="164.05" dur="3.72">adultery</text>
  <text start="164.68" dur="5.1">so with that nailed to the cross can we</text>
  <text start="167.77" dur="4.77">now commit adultery call of course not</text>
  <text start="169.78" dur="5.64">no Christian would say that in the Torah</text>
  <text start="172.54" dur="3.36">and it says thou shalt not bear false</text>
  <text start="175.42" dur="2.58">witness</text>
  <text start="175.9" dur="4.77">so did he nail that to the cross so that</text>
  <text start="178" dur="4.23">we no longer have to we can start</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="3.45">bearing false witness all around</text>
  <text start="182.23" dur="3.72">ourselves because they he nailed to the</text>
  <text start="184.12" dur="3.54">ground of course not so that&amp;#39;s clearly</text>
  <text start="185.95" dur="5.73">not what it&amp;#39;s saying so what is it</text>
  <text start="187.66" dur="6.329">saying okay so he&amp;#39;s in verse 13 he</text>
  <text start="191.68" dur="4.11">purged us from our transgressions of the</text>
  <text start="193.989" dur="4.321">Torah our sins that&amp;#39;s what first John</text>
  <text start="195.79" dur="4.979">3:4 says that sin is transgressing or</text>
  <text start="198.31" dur="4.2">breaking the Torah he&amp;#39;s forgiven us of</text>
  <text start="200.769" dur="4.771">those things because we were once dead</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="5.91">in them and now he&amp;#39;s blotted out what</text>
  <text start="205.54" dur="5.49">he&amp;#39;s blotted out the handwriting of</text>
  <text start="208.42" dur="4.83">Ordinances that was against us which was</text>
  <text start="211.03" dur="5.7">contrary to us and took it out of the</text>
  <text start="213.25" dur="7.58">way nailing it to his cross what did he</text>
  <text start="216.73" dur="7.2">blot out he blotted out the condemnation</text>
  <text start="220.83" dur="5.77">that the Torah brings when we break it</text>
  <text start="223.93" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s what he blotted out he blotted</text>
  <text start="226.6" dur="4.56">out the curse of the law remember this</text>
  <text start="229.06" dur="4.29">is what I talked about in my in part 8</text>
  <text start="231.16" dur="5.01">that this is the essence of the gospel</text>
  <text start="233.35" dur="5.16">that the Torah the commandments the law</text>
  <text start="236.17" dur="4.92">before we fall in love with the Messiah</text>
  <text start="238.51" dur="3.93">all they do they&amp;#39;re contrary to us they</text>
  <text start="241.09" dur="2.91">convict us they condemn us they just</text>
  <text start="242.44" dur="3.75">show us how wicked we are right that</text>
  <text start="244" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re under the law under the curse of</text>
  <text start="246.19" dur="5.76">the law at that point but once Yahshua</text>
  <text start="249.22" dur="4.38">the son of yah once he fills our heart</text>
  <text start="251.95" dur="4.77">once he washes us in his blood and</text>
  <text start="253.6" dur="4.5">builds us his spirit now because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="256.72" dur="2.22">fallen in love with him because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.1" dur="3.419">changed our heart</text>
  <text start="258.94" dur="5.22">by living inside us now those very same</text>
  <text start="261.519" dur="6.331">laws of commandments that once condemned</text>
  <text start="264.16" dur="5.16">us that once accused us now we have a</text>
  <text start="267.85" dur="4.2">different attitude toward those laws now</text>
  <text start="269.32" dur="5.04">we want to obey those laws this is what</text>
  <text start="272.05" dur="3.78">he means in verse 13 when he says you</text>
  <text start="274.36" dur="3.42">were once dead in your sins</text>
  <text start="275.83" dur="4.11">now before you fell in love with Messiah</text>
  <text start="277.78" dur="3.81">you you wanted to commit adultery you</text>
  <text start="279.94" dur="4.38">wanted to bear false witness you wanted</text>
  <text start="281.59" dur="4.29">to to cheat and to steal and you had all</text>
  <text start="284.32" dur="4.68">these other false gods you did all these</text>
  <text start="285.88" dur="6.06">things because you couldn&amp;#39;t keep the law</text>
  <text start="289" dur="4.47">you didn&amp;#39;t want to but now he&amp;#39;s blotted</text>
  <text start="291.94" dur="4.23">out that condemnation</text>
  <text start="293.47" dur="5.73">he&amp;#39;s blotted out those accusations he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.17" dur="5.34">blotted out that that ordinance or that</text>
  <text start="299.2" dur="4.56">that handwriting of divorce he&amp;#39;s blotted</text>
  <text start="301.51" dur="4.95">it out he took that away he took that</text>
  <text start="303.76" dur="4.86">condemnation off of us and now filled us</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="4.59">for the spirit so that we can obey Him</text>
  <text start="308.62" dur="2.97">we can keep his Commandments we can do</text>
  <text start="311.05" dur="3.03">his things</text>
  <text start="311.59" dur="6.33">we won&amp;#39;t commit adultery we won&amp;#39;t bear</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="5.61">false witness we will love our neighbor</text>
  <text start="317.92" dur="2.76">as ourselves we will love yah with all</text>
  <text start="319.69" dur="2.64">our heart soul mind and strength</text>
  <text start="320.68" dur="3.39">we will keep his Commandments we will</text>
  <text start="322.33" dur="4.17">keep the Sabbath day the seventh day we</text>
  <text start="324.07" dur="6.06">will do these things because we love Him</text>
  <text start="326.5" dur="5.88">this is the gospel and this is what Paul</text>
  <text start="330.13" dur="4.53">is saying that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s being blotted</text>
  <text start="332.38" dur="5.37">out is that condemnation of the law</text>
  <text start="334.66" dur="4.59">brings when you break it because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="337.75" dur="3.93">when the law is contrary to you the law</text>
  <text start="339.25" dur="4.56">is not contrary to you when you&amp;#39;re full</text>
  <text start="341.68" dur="4.41">of the Spirit when you love him you want</text>
  <text start="343.81" dur="4.77">to obey Him that&amp;#39;s why John again says</text>
  <text start="346.09" dur="3.68">he who loves him for to him who loves</text>
  <text start="348.58" dur="4.68">him His commandments are not burdensome</text>
  <text start="349.77" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;re not burdensome this is so</text>
  <text start="353.26" dur="4.86">important to remember so it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="355.72" dur="3.9">condemnation is the condemnation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.12" dur="3.78">the curse that the law brings to your</text>
  <text start="359.62" dur="4.77">life that is nailed to the cross that is</text>
  <text start="361.9" dur="4.59">what&amp;#39;s nailed it&amp;#39;s that divorce that yah</text>
  <text start="364.39" dur="4.44">had over your life before you came to</text>
  <text start="366.49" dur="5.25">him before you left him that has blotted</text>
  <text start="368.83" dur="4.53">out by his precious blood by him going</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="3.3">to the execution stake and giving his</text>
  <text start="373.36" dur="5.58">life and then resurrecting three days</text>
  <text start="375.04" dur="6.93">and three nights later so now he goes</text>
  <text start="378.94" dur="5.28">into the very next part in verse 16 so</text>
  <text start="381.97" dur="5.79">he tells these believers he says let no</text>
  <text start="384.22" dur="6.15">man therefore judge you in food and meat</text>
  <text start="387.76" dur="4.25">or in drink or in respect of an holyday</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="3.89">or the new moon</text>
  <text start="392.01" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re on the Sabbath days now people</text>
  <text start="394.26" dur="4.17">will take that one verse and say look</text>
  <text start="395.64" dur="5.16">all saying don&amp;#39;t let anyone judge you</text>
  <text start="398.43" dur="3.69">you don&amp;#39;t have to do these things okay</text>
  <text start="400.8" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s clearly not what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="402.12" dur="4.38">because let&amp;#39;s go to verse 17 because</text>
  <text start="404.73" dur="6.48">this is a continuation of that sentence</text>
  <text start="406.5" dur="9.03">he says which are are a shadow of things</text>
  <text start="411.21" dur="7.08">to come but the body is of Messiah what</text>
  <text start="415.53" dur="6.33">he&amp;#39;s telling because in verse 17 he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="418.29" dur="6">saying that the clean foods holy days</text>
  <text start="421.86" dur="4.17">new moons and Sabbath days are a shadow</text>
  <text start="424.29" dur="5.55">they are still a shadow of things to</text>
  <text start="426.03" dur="6.53">come remember this book this letter that</text>
  <text start="429.84" dur="5.79">he writes for these believers in colossi</text>
  <text start="432.56" dur="5.17">this book was written several years</text>
  <text start="435.63" dur="6.66">after the resurrection and yet he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="437.73" dur="8.52">still saying that clean foods holy days</text>
  <text start="442.29" dur="6.63">new moons Sabbath days that these things</text>
  <text start="446.25" dur="5.1">still are pointing toward our shadow of</text>
  <text start="448.92" dur="4.77">things to come so that basically what</text>
  <text start="451.35" dur="3.93">he&amp;#39;s saying in this verse 16 is that</text>
  <text start="453.69" dur="3.06">these things still have relevance to our</text>
  <text start="455.28" dur="3.69">lives because they&amp;#39;re still pointing</text>
  <text start="456.75" dur="3.63">they are still currently shadows of</text>
  <text start="458.97" dur="4.32">things to come so here&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.38" dur="5.61">really saying he&amp;#39;s saying you don&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="463.29" dur="4.74">these pagan people in the city of</text>
  <text start="465.99" dur="3.69">colossi there&amp;#39;s a cloth I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="468.03" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s pronounced you don&amp;#39;t let these</text>
  <text start="469.68" dur="3.99">pagan people judge you don&amp;#39;t let them</text>
  <text start="471.51" dur="4.47">condemn you and say oh you&amp;#39;re so stupid</text>
  <text start="473.67" dur="4.26">for keeping these holy days and</text>
  <text start="475.98" dur="3.99">observing these new moons and keeping</text>
  <text start="477.93" dur="3.51">the Sabbath days and why do you have to</text>
  <text start="479.97" dur="3.84">eat these clean food what are you doing</text>
  <text start="481.44" dur="6.15">your businesses don&amp;#39;t let them judge you</text>
  <text start="483.81" dur="4.95">because you know what these are a shadow</text>
  <text start="487.59" dur="2.97">of things to come</text>
  <text start="488.76" dur="3.6">these are still relevant to your life</text>
  <text start="490.56" dur="3.21">these are still pointing toward things</text>
  <text start="492.36" dur="2.79">that are still yet to come and of course</text>
  <text start="493.77" dur="3.99">we know this if you look at the feast</text>
  <text start="495.15" dur="4.53">days the Yahshua fulfilled the spring</text>
  <text start="497.76" dur="3.69">feasts Passover and shabwa</text>
  <text start="499.68" dur="4.08">but he is not yet fulfilled the fall</text>

  <text start="503.76" dur="3">Atonement and the Feast of Tabernacles</text>
  <text start="505.23" dur="4.32">or the feast of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="506.76" dur="4.17">he hasn&amp;#39;t fulfilled those things the new</text>
  <text start="509.55" dur="3.21">moon it talks about in the last chapter</text>
  <text start="510.93" dur="3.54">of Isaiah that in the new heavens and</text>

  <text start="519.3" dur="4.14">worship Him so keeping the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="521.94" dur="3.45">observing the new moons these things are</text>
  <text start="523.44" dur="5.16">still pointing toward things that are</text>
  <text start="525.39" dur="4.83">yet to filled and as of you know 30 to</text>
  <text start="528.6" dur="4.4">40 years after the resurrection when</text>
  <text start="530.22" dur="5.37">Paul wrote this and as of today in 2017</text>
  <text start="533" dur="4.51">that is the only way to properly</text>
  <text start="535.59" dur="6.08">interpret verse 16 to make sense of</text>
  <text start="537.51" dur="6.75">verse 17 so to take this whole thing</text>
  <text start="541.67" dur="6.1">this whole little passage here in</text>
  <text start="544.26" dur="5.37">Colossians 2 he&amp;#39;s saying you were dead</text>
  <text start="547.77" dur="4.04">in your sins which is transgression of</text>

  <text start="568.98" dur="5.7">condemnation and then he says so don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="572.19" dur="4.47">you let these pagan Colossians judge you</text>
  <text start="574.68" dur="3.93">and laugh that you would mock you for</text>
