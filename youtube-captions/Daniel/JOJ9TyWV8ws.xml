  <text start="94.619" dur="3.631">so a lot of you already know and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="3.979">already reported on this and and this is</text>
  <text start="98.25" dur="4.89">from an article that was published on</text>
  <text start="100.729" dur="3.82">December 10th actually just today ago a</text>
  <text start="103.14" dur="3.72">lot of you know about the official</text>
  <text start="104.549" dur="5.701">statistics about 800,000 children in the</text>

  <text start="112.759" dur="4.511">but what you might not know is that</text>
  <text start="114.689" dur="7.521">there&amp;#39;s actually eight million children</text>
  <text start="117.27" dur="8.099">globally eight million children globally</text>
  <text start="122.21" dur="6.01">which to me that&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s utterly</text>
  <text start="125.369" dur="6.061">horrifying and yet this is something we</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="4.89">need to talk about many high-level</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="3.75">politicians on both sides of the eye</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="3.87">I&amp;#39;ll actively participate and partake of</text>
  <text start="135.18" dur="5.4">this unimaginable evil and one of the</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="5.73">reasons is as horrifying as it sounds is</text>
  <text start="140.58" dur="4.17">because child sex trafficking is about</text>
  <text start="142.71" dur="4.83">ten times more lucrative in terms of</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="5.31">dollars than jugged trafficking so this</text>
  <text start="147.54" dur="4.89">is why it catches up so many corrupt</text>
  <text start="150.06" dur="4.65">politicians and leaders and and not just</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="4.44">even I&amp;#39;m not even just talking about DC</text>
  <text start="154.71" dur="4.11">and Hollywood per se or around the globe</text>
  <text start="156.87" dur="4.91">I&amp;#39;m talking about even businessmen CEOs</text>
  <text start="158.82" dur="5.46">that are caught up in this stuff and</text>
  <text start="161.78" dur="4.3">I&amp;#39;ll go ahead and post this article that</text>
  <text start="164.28" dur="3.81">was published yesterday and it has all</text>
  <text start="166.08" dur="3.33">these statistics on there that the</text>

  <text start="187.11" dur="3.66">actually had interviews of three women</text>
  <text start="188.64" dur="4.98">but they released on May 3rd 2013</text>
  <text start="190.77" dur="5.189">these were employees of abortion mill</text>
  <text start="193.62" dur="5.97">clinics well I like to call them murder</text>
  <text start="195.959" dur="5.491">clinics and basically I mean I could</text>
  <text start="199.59" dur="4.08">read the description here mark Crutcher</text>
  <text start="201.45" dur="3.6">president of life dynamics while the</text>
  <text start="203.67" dur="2.7">pro-life movement claims that abortion</text>
  <text start="205.05" dur="3.24">takes the life of a living human being</text>
  <text start="206.37" dur="3.149">no banana earth knows that better than</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="3.78">the people who work at abortion clinics</text>
  <text start="209.519" dur="4.021">the lofty rhetoric of choice may</text>
  <text start="212.07" dur="3.51">insulate those who work in the political</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="3.51">and public relations arena but the</text>
  <text start="215.58" dur="2.879">day-to-day reality for those who provide</text>
  <text start="217.05" dur="3.93">those choices is to deal with the</text>
  <text start="218.459" dur="4.861">corpses and parts of corpses they pull</text>
  <text start="220.98" dur="3.9">out of their customers bodies one</text>
  <text start="223.32" dur="2.94">abortion clinic employee said I thought</text>
  <text start="224.88" dur="2.97">well it&amp;#39;s not boring you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="3.6">what he does but I wasn&amp;#39;t aware that it</text>
  <text start="227.85" dur="3.27">was illegal most of the time we would</text>
  <text start="229.86" dur="2.79">see him where the fetus would come</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="4.38">completely out and of course the fetus</text>
  <text start="232.65" dur="4.53">would still be alive these are three</text>
  <text start="235.5" dur="4.47">interviews done by three different women</text>
  <text start="237.18" dur="5.4">all employees of an abortion clinic and</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="5.34">they testify about how basically these</text>
  <text start="242.58" dur="5.4">babies are born alive and these fetuses</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="4.459">and I again this is a horrific thing to</text>
  <text start="247.98" dur="4.229">talk about but they take these fetuses</text>
  <text start="249.769" dur="4.061">the abortion mill industry is the other</text>
  <text start="252.209" dur="3.601">side of the coin of the Satanic</text>
  <text start="253.83" dur="3.99">pedophile child sex trafficking Network</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="4.59">because they will take these fetuses and</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="5.67">they will actually use them in satanic</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="4.76">blood ritual sacrifices they will use</text>
  <text start="263.49" dur="3.65">them to harvest the</text>
  <text start="265.16" dur="4.23">especially if they&amp;#39;re living because the</text>
  <text start="267.14" dur="4.29">amount of adrenal glands that&amp;#39;s released</text>
  <text start="269.39" dur="4.08">when a fetus is alive and they kill it</text>
  <text start="271.43" dur="3.98">it is more horrific than I even want to</text>
  <text start="273.47" dur="4.28">contemplate but it is it is absolutely</text>
  <text start="275.41" dur="5.53">disgusting what&amp;#39;s going on and why</text>
  <text start="277.75" dur="5.5">abortion it&amp;#39;s not just the murder of a</text>
  <text start="280.94" dur="3.99">baby as horrific as that is and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="283.25" dur="3.78">trying to downplay it but they are using</text>
  <text start="284.93" dur="4.68">this for the Satanic pedophile cabal&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.03" dur="4.86">and that&amp;#39;s the point I want to make now</text>
