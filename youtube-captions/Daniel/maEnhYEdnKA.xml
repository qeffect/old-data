  <text start="11.759" dur="4.201">time there&amp;#39;s absolutely no parking</text>
  <text start="14.49" dur="3.24">anywhere I haven&amp;#39;t even gone to the very</text>
  <text start="15.96" dur="2.97">top where I normally park in the visitor</text>
  <text start="17.73" dur="5.82">parking structure and there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="18.93" dur="7.53">nothing it&amp;#39;s interesting there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="23.55" dur="5.25">scripture in the book of Acts where Paul</text>
  <text start="26.46" dur="4.92">he talks about how he tries to preach an</text>
  <text start="28.8" dur="3.84">Asian and literally the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="31.38" dur="3.03">prevents him from doing so</text>
  <text start="32.64" dur="3.509">and I don&amp;#39;t know if a similar things</text>
  <text start="34.41" dur="4.38">happening with UCSD I know that the</text>
  <text start="36.149" dur="4.621">first day I preached last Monday day one</text>
  <text start="38.79" dur="4.35">was incredible spectacular I had all</text>
  <text start="40.77" dur="3.84">these students helping me to witness and</text>
  <text start="43.14" dur="3.509">preachers just I thought I was revival</text>
  <text start="44.61" dur="4.109">and then Days two through four were</text>
  <text start="46.649" dur="3.901">absolutely horrible like I mean the</text>
  <text start="48.719" dur="4.171">admin trying to throw me off where I was</text>
  <text start="50.55" dur="4.89">preaching and students just incredibly</text>
  <text start="52.89" dur="5.579">hard-hearted arrogant professor</text>
  <text start="55.44" dur="4.439">confronting me just horrible and then of</text>
  <text start="58.469" dur="3.121">course there was rain yesterday which I</text>
  <text start="59.879" dur="3.75">was actually thankful for because it</text>
  <text start="61.59" dur="4.62">came here an additional day of rest and</text>
  <text start="63.629" dur="5.131">plus I was able to get together with the</text>
  <text start="66.21" dur="5.22">cop the investigator John and his wife</text>
  <text start="68.76" dur="4.77">Shannon and was able to interview him he</text>
  <text start="71.43" dur="3.95">goes after satanic pedophiles and it</text>
  <text start="73.53" dur="5.879">happened to be his day off of work too</text>
  <text start="75.38" dur="6.19">he has Mondays and Shabbat off so that</text>
  <text start="79.409" dur="4.291">worked out well so I came out here today</text>
  <text start="81.57" dur="3.6">thinking well you know I&amp;#39;ll see and it</text>
  <text start="83.7" dur="3.12">you know they look like there&amp;#39;s a there</text>
  <text start="85.17" dur="3.51">is a break in the weather I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="86.82" dur="4.08">a lot of storm clouds out but it looks</text>
  <text start="88.68" dur="6.57">like it&amp;#39;s you know the rains held back</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="7.35">but there&amp;#39;s no parking there&amp;#39;s none so I</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t know maybe I was just saying you</text>
  <text start="98.25" dur="4.049">need to wait another day I know that</text>
  <text start="100.11" dur="3.57">tomorrow it is going to be sunny it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="102.299" dur="2.761">gonna be sunny all day so I&amp;#39;m definitely</text>

  <text start="107.399" dur="4.891">looking for today five because five and</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="6.419">scripture means mercy and grace so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="112.29" dur="6.48">believing for a breakthrough at UCSD but</text>
  <text start="115.619" dur="5.371">I think what I&amp;#39;m gonna do is I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="118.77" dur="3.87">go back to that I&amp;#39;m possibly gonna go</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="3.229">back to that Creation Museum I was sort</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="4.019">of rushed on Sunday when I went there</text>
  <text start="124.219" dur="3.291">just because I got there it was only</text>
  <text start="126.659" dur="3.941">opening limit</text>
  <text start="127.51" dur="4.86">hours because it was Sunday and of</text>
  <text start="130.6" dur="3.51">course I spent time meeting John and</text>
  <text start="132.37" dur="3.42">Shannon there and then I didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="134.11" dur="3.87">have a lot of time to go through it all</text>
  <text start="135.79" dur="5.51">so I think I might go back there today</text>
  <text start="137.98" dur="5.13">where they&amp;#39;re open for longer hours and</text>
  <text start="141.3" dur="3.91">then I also might work on some</text>

  <text start="146.38" dur="5.7">which I have every night but at least at</text>
  <text start="149.71" dur="3.87">this point I can&amp;#39;t find parking at UCSD</text>
  <text start="152.08" dur="3.54">so I&amp;#39;m just gonna take it as another</text>
  <text start="153.58" dur="4.62">sign from yah to take another break from</text>
  <text start="155.62" dur="4.35">print campus preaching and just a center</text>
  <text start="158.2" dur="3.84">on the other three pillars of my</text>
  <text start="159.97" dur="6.27">ministry which is to expose Satanic</text>

  <text start="166.24" dur="7.62">platform to speak out on and protect the</text>
  <text start="170.71" dur="5.85">innocent children so I think that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="189.13" dur="3.75">got to make sure all my eyes were dotted</text>
  <text start="191.14" dur="3.87">and my T&amp;#39;s are crossed because this</text>
  <text start="192.88" dur="5.7">involves Isaac happy</text>
  <text start="195.01" dur="4.89">Eli priest and a bunch of stuff they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="229.799" dur="3.5">parking by the way as I&amp;#39;m driving around</text>
  <text start="231.48" dur="6.899">the campus but I just don&amp;#39;t see anything</text>
  <text start="233.299" dur="6.731">I could park wherever at the glide port</text>
  <text start="238.379" dur="3.271">but the problem of that is with all the</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="4.83">rain it&amp;#39;s probably a muddy mess over</text>
