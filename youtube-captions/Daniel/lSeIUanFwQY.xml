  <text start="3.21" dur="8.19">fellowship we&amp;#39;re going to go over Daniel</text>
  <text start="7.95" dur="8.7">chapter 9 as we are now only four days</text>
  <text start="11.4" dur="7.74">away from Hanukkah Daniel chapter 9 this</text>
  <text start="16.65" dur="8.78">is the 21st day of the ninth month and</text>
  <text start="19.14" dur="6.29">of course it took 21 days for Daniel to</text>
  <text start="29.2" dur="7.66">took 21 days for Daniel to pray the fast</text>
  <text start="34.91" dur="3.54">before Yasha was able to get through to</text>
  <text start="36.86" dur="5.42">him with the message and it was the</text>
  <text start="38.45" dur="7.53">message that&amp;#39;s in Daniel chapter 9 now I</text>
  <text start="42.28" dur="8.05">have an article on my website if you</text>
  <text start="45.98" dur="8.1">scroll down fairly far down the main</text>
  <text start="50.33" dur="8.31">page you&amp;#39;ll eventually come to a graphic</text>
  <text start="54.08" dur="9.18">that&amp;#39;s like a basically it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="58.64" dur="7.17">clock that&amp;#39;s in a spiral but this story</text>
  <text start="63.26" dur="8.58">is called the riddle King Cyrus Daniels</text>
  <text start="65.81" dur="8.58">70 weeks 17 siiii and 2017 siiii and it</text>
  <text start="71.84" dur="5.94">very clearly explains Daniel chapter 9 a</text>
  <text start="74.39" dur="5.61">very easy to understand way because when</text>
  <text start="77.78" dur="3.87">you read daniel chapter 9 you know</text>
  <text start="80" dur="3.72">people say oh you know we shouldn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="81.65" dur="5.64">date setting don&amp;#39;t do date setting well</text>
  <text start="83.72" dur="5.81">the spirit of yacht eventually gets</text>
  <text start="87.29" dur="4.35">through to daniel in the form of Yahshua</text>
  <text start="89.53" dur="3.61">Yahshua fights through all the spiritual</text>
  <text start="91.64" dur="3.84">warfare and gets the day after 21 days</text>
  <text start="93.14" dur="4.44">of fasting and Yahshua tells Daniel to</text>
  <text start="95.48" dur="4.62">do some date setting because basically</text>
  <text start="97.58" dur="4.5">if you read general chapter 9 well</text>
  <text start="100.1" dur="5.4">Yahshua says is that there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="102.08" dur="6.39">a period of 70 weeks and each week</text>
  <text start="105.5" dur="6.21">represents a period of years it&amp;#39;s a week</text>
  <text start="108.47" dur="6.09">of years so each week is representative</text>
  <text start="111.71" dur="5.19">of seven years and there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="114.56" dur="4.53">seventy weeks of these years well the</text>
  <text start="116.9" dur="4.98">first 69 weeks of course have already</text>
  <text start="119.09" dur="4.83">been fulfilled that was the 483 years</text>
  <text start="121.88" dur="5.1">between the time the decree was issued</text>
  <text start="123.92" dur="5.19">to rebuild Jerusalem the time that</text>
  <text start="126.98" dur="4.589">Yahshua the Messiah was cut off I was</text>
  <text start="129.11" dur="5.25">the first 69 weeks and then there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="131.569" dur="4.771">gap between the 69th week and the 70th</text>
  <text start="134.36" dur="3.87">week of Daniel but it&amp;#39;s all explained at</text>
  <text start="136.34" dur="6.899">that article and i&amp;#39;ll put i&amp;#39;ll put a</text>
  <text start="138.23" dur="7.44">link to this article in this particular</text>
  <text start="143.239" dur="7.881">podcast it&amp;#39;s called the riddle King</text>

  <text start="151.12" dur="4.35">now I have a youtube teaching on this as</text>
  <text start="153.83" dur="4.16">well I&amp;#39;ll provide that link as well</text>
  <text start="155.47" dur="6.11">but basically there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="157.99" dur="5.97">historical data regarding King Cyrus</text>
  <text start="161.58" dur="4.78">regarding when the temple was built when</text>
  <text start="163.96" dur="4.17">this decree was issued but if you go to</text>
  <text start="166.36" dur="4.62">that article and again you need to click</text>
  <text start="168.13" dur="5.49">on that link you&amp;#39;re going to find that</text>
  <text start="170.98" dur="4.05">there&amp;#39;s a timeline that yah basically</text>
  <text start="173.62" dur="4.71">has confirmed for a lot of historical</text>
  <text start="175.03" dur="5.7">resources that I&amp;#39;ve discovered and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="178.33" dur="4.35">you know generally accepted his history</text>
  <text start="180.73" dur="5.82">but I verified it with the scriptures</text>
  <text start="182.68" dur="8.52">and by doing so I was able to determine</text>
  <text start="186.55" dur="8.07">the exact year the exact year that the</text>
  <text start="191.2" dur="5.4">decree went forth to rebuild the temple</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="6.839">and this of course is what starts the</text>
  <text start="196.6" dur="7.5">countdown of Daniel 70 weeks and again</text>
  <text start="201.459" dur="4.921">if you go to that that article you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="204.1" dur="8.19">see that I approve historically through</text>
  <text start="206.38" dur="10.41">this timeline that in the year 467 467</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="6.51">bc which happens to be the 20th year of</text>
  <text start="216.79" dur="3.54">exert sees the first and his son</text>
  <text start="218.8" dur="4.439">artaxerxes the first because they</text>
  <text start="220.33" dur="6.39">colerain together this is the year that</text>
  <text start="223.239" dur="5.401">Nehemiah 25 occurs and if you read</text>
  <text start="226.72" dur="4.41">Nehemiah 25 you find out that Nehemiah</text>
  <text start="228.64" dur="6.03">is commissioned by the King at Nia mais</text>
  <text start="231.13" dur="5.579">request to travel from Babylon to</text>
  <text start="234.67" dur="6.48">Jerusalem any rebuilds the city of</text>
  <text start="236.709" dur="8.161">Jerusalem now some several years before</text>
  <text start="241.15" dur="5.369">if you go back to 46 BC you&amp;#39;ll find out</text>
  <text start="244.87" dur="3.06">that exerts he&amp;#39;s the first who takes the</text>
  <text start="246.519" dur="4.021">name of his grandfather Cyrus the Great</text>
  <text start="247.93" dur="4.32">this is when he issues the decree to</text>
  <text start="250.54" dur="3.21">rebuild the temple and that&amp;#39;s the first</text>
  <text start="252.25" dur="3.36">shooters ring that&amp;#39;s what s your chapter</text>
  <text start="253.75" dur="4.109">1 occurs but that&amp;#39;s not the starting</text>
  <text start="255.61" dur="5.76">point of Daniel 70 weeks because if you</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="5.131">read Daniel 9 it says very clearly not</text>
  <text start="261.37" dur="3.99">when the decrees issued to rebuild the</text>
  <text start="262.99" dur="4.679">temple but when the decree is issued to</text>
  <text start="265.36" dur="5.78">rebuild the city and I&amp;#39;ll prove this by</text>
  <text start="267.669" dur="5.911">going to Daniel 9 and he says this</text>
  <text start="271.14" dur="4.75">seventy weeks are determined upon by</text>
  <text start="273.58" dur="5.37">people and upon the holy city to finish</text>
  <text start="275.89" dur="4.92">the transgression and to make an end of</text>
  <text start="278.95" dur="3.69">sins and to make reconciliation for</text>
  <text start="280.81" dur="3.87">iniquity and to bring in everlasting</text>
  <text start="282.64" dur="4.13">righteousness and to seal up the vision</text>
  <text start="284.68" dur="4.38">of prophecy and to anoint the most holy</text>
  <text start="286.77" dur="4.329">know therefore and understand that from</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="5.76">the going forth of the commandment to</text>
  <text start="291.099" dur="5.371">restore and to build Jerusalem under the</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="4.08">Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks</text>
  <text start="296.47" dur="6.86">and threescore in two weeks or seven</text>
  <text start="298.9" dur="6.72">plus 62 or 69 weeks which is 483 years</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="4.69">the street shall be built again in the</text>
  <text start="305.62" dur="4.83">wall even in troubles times and after</text>
  <text start="308.02" dur="3.75">this period of three scoring two weeks</text>
  <text start="310.45" dur="4.05">and then the seven leave after this</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="5.459">period of 69 weeks shall the Messiah be</text>
  <text start="314.5" dur="4.59">cut off but not for himself so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.229" dur="4.261">the first part of the Daniel 70 weeks so</text>
  <text start="319.09" dur="5.579">it&amp;#39;s not the the there was a degree in</text>
  <text start="321.49" dur="4.41">486 bc that exerts he&amp;#39;s the first who</text>
  <text start="324.669" dur="3.481">took on the name of his grandfather</text>
  <text start="325.9" dur="3.9">cyrus the great issues to rebuild the</text>
  <text start="328.15" dur="3.99">temple but that&amp;#39;s not the decree that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="329.8" dur="3.96">referred to in Daniel 9 because dan and</text>
  <text start="332.14" dur="4.29">I specific says it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the decree to</text>
  <text start="333.76" dur="4.29">rebuild the city not the temple and if</text>
  <text start="336.43" dur="3.45">you read Ezra one you&amp;#39;ll find out that</text>
  <text start="338.05" dur="3.119">all they did was laid the foundation of</text>
  <text start="339.88" dur="2.909">the temple they were just centering on</text>
  <text start="341.169" dur="6.18">reconstructing the temple you actually</text>
  <text start="342.789" dur="6.481">have to go to Nehemiah chapter 2 to find</text>
  <text start="347.349" dur="5.25">out when the seventy weeks of Daniel</text>
  <text start="349.27" dur="4.86">began and it is in Nehemiah chapter 2</text>
  <text start="352.599" dur="3.361">that you re very clearly that Nehemiah</text>
  <text start="354.13" dur="4.2">is commanded to not just rebuild the</text>
  <text start="355.96" dur="4.62">temple but to rebuild the entire city of</text>
  <text start="358.33" dur="4.29">Jerusalem and again that occurs in the</text>
  <text start="360.58" dur="4.5">20th year of exert sees the first and</text>
  <text start="362.62" dur="5.37">also the 20th year of artaxerxes the</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="4.589">first this is when Nehemiah in Nehemiah</text>
  <text start="367.99" dur="3.96">chapter 2 is commanded to build the city</text>
  <text start="369.669" dur="3.631">of Jerusalem and so now according to the</text>
  <text start="371.95" dur="6.149">end of night this is when the 70 weeks</text>
  <text start="373.3" dur="6.54">begins its in the year 467 bc and all</text>
  <text start="378.099" dur="4.32">the events that occur between nehemiah</text>
  <text start="379.84" dur="7.47">chapter two and nine they all happen in</text>
  <text start="382.419" dur="6.331">the year 467 bc so 467 bc which again</text>

  <text start="391.84" dur="5.79">talking about I prove very clearly that</text>
  <text start="393.849" dur="6.451">it is 467 bc both scripturally and from</text>
  <text start="397.63" dur="6.9">numerous historical sort citations at</text>
  <text start="400.3" dur="6.57">467 bc is the beginning of the seventy</text>
  <text start="404.53" dur="5.759">weeks of Daniel as stipulated in Daniel</text>
  <text start="406.87" dur="7.26">9 now it says that there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="410.289" dur="4.701">period of seven weeks of years and then</text>
  <text start="414.13" dur="2.9">62</text>
  <text start="414.99" dur="3.54">civ years and then the size cut off so</text>
  <text start="417.03" dur="3.75">seven weeks of years would be seven</text>
  <text start="418.53" dur="5.52">times seven that&amp;#39;s 49 years because</text>

  <text start="443.1" dur="4.26">built in trouble sometimes which i just</text>
  <text start="444.48" dur="7.56">read in Daniel well if you go from 467</text>
  <text start="447.36" dur="9.93">bc and you go 49 years later you come to</text>
  <text start="452.04" dur="8.36">the year for 18 bc that&amp;#39;s exactly forty</text>
  <text start="457.29" dur="6.51">nine years later or seven weeks of years</text>
  <text start="460.4" dur="5.8">well in 418 bc if you look at this</text>
  <text start="463.8" dur="5.46">torical citations that I have at this</text>
  <text start="466.2" dur="5.46">article I&amp;#39;m telling you to read in 418</text>
  <text start="469.26" dur="4.38">bc exactly forty nine years later just</text>
  <text start="471.66" dur="4.23">like being a prophesied it&amp;#39;s the six</text>
  <text start="473.64" dur="7.4">year of darius the two and the events of</text>
  <text start="475.89" dur="7.41">Ezra 6 15 to 20 seconds are done Ezra 6</text>
  <text start="481.04" dur="4.96">verses 15 through 22 this is when the</text>
  <text start="483.3" dur="4.68">temples finished this is 49 years of</text>
  <text start="486" dur="4.02">Daniel seventy weeks of a lapse or seven</text>
  <text start="487.98" dur="3.72">weeks of years but the problem is he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.02" dur="3.48">not done because i just read Anna Daniel</text>
  <text start="491.7" dur="4.82">line that there was going to be seven</text>
  <text start="493.5" dur="6.99">weeks and then another 62 weeks of years</text>
  <text start="496.52" dur="6.67">again we&amp;#39;ve done the 49 years the</text>
  <text start="500.49" dur="5.01">temples finally done in 418 bc from anna</text>
  <text start="503.19" dur="4.08">70 weeks start but now we got another 62</text>
  <text start="505.5" dur="3.78">weeks of years or four hundred and</text>
  <text start="507.27" dur="6.41">thirty-four years from the time the</text>
  <text start="509.28" dur="8.91">temple is finished and for 18 bc well</text>
  <text start="513.68" dur="8.14">434 years after 418 bc lands you exactly</text>
  <text start="518.19" dur="7.65">in the year 17 ad or 17 siiii whatever</text>
  <text start="521.82" dur="5.82">you want to use and of course 17 c e is</text>
  <text start="525.84" dur="4.65">the year that the ancient historian</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="7.17">Pliny records that this major Middle</text>
  <text start="530.49" dur="6.12">Eastern earthquake occurs that is so</text>
  <text start="534.81" dur="3.51">powerful that not only does it shake up</text>
  <text start="536.61" dur="4.83">Jerusalem but it reaches as far north as</text>
  <text start="538.32" dur="7.38">Asia Minor and overthrows twelve cities</text>
  <text start="541.44" dur="5.67">including Sardis so it all fits in like</text>
  <text start="545.7" dur="1.78">a puzzle piece everything fits in</text>
  <text start="547.11" dur="2.529">perfect</text>
  <text start="547.48" dur="3.599">plate so yeah let me go over because</text>
  <text start="549.639" dur="3.271">this is kind of confusing let me go over</text>
  <text start="551.079" dur="4.591">again what would we have here we have a</text>
  <text start="552.91" dur="6.539">total of seventy weeks of years each</text>
  <text start="555.67" dur="6.539">week is equivalent to seven years so we</text>
  <text start="559.449" dur="4.88">first have this 69 weeks of years which</text>
  <text start="562.209" dur="6.391">is seven weeks of years and then another</text>
  <text start="564.329" dur="5.771">62 okay and it says basically in the</text>
  <text start="568.6" dur="4.5">seven weeks of years the temple will be</text>
  <text start="570.1" dur="8.13">rebuilt in trouble sometimes yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="573.1" dur="6.599">from 467 bc until 418 bc that&amp;#39;s the 49</text>
  <text start="578.23" dur="2.849">years or the southern weeks of years and</text>
  <text start="579.699" dur="4.08">then it says there&amp;#39;s going to be another</text>
  <text start="581.079" dur="4.651">62 weeks of years between that time that</text>
  <text start="583.779" dur="3.961">temples finished and the city is</text>
  <text start="585.73" dur="3.63">finished and when messiahs cut off and</text>
  <text start="587.74" dur="4.14">of course you see that there&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="589.36" dur="5.82">62 weeks of years or four hundred and</text>
  <text start="591.88" dur="6.3">thirty-four years between 418 bc and 17</text>
  <text start="595.18" dur="5.37">c e when Joshua of Nazareth in the</text>
  <text start="598.18" dur="6.33">spring of seventeen CA on Passover is</text>
  <text start="600.55" dur="7.26">cut off he&amp;#39;s crucified on the tree I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="604.51" dur="6.47">mount mount of olives and go golf from</text>
  <text start="607.81" dur="6.779">the place of the skull a Mount of Olives</text>
  <text start="610.98" dur="9.219">otherwise known as Calvary so again we</text>
  <text start="614.589" dur="8.911">have 69 weeks of years 69 because 7 plus</text>
  <text start="620.199" dur="7.83">60 to 69 we have 69 weeks of years that</text>
  <text start="623.5" dur="6.69">occurs from 467 bc again 69 weeks of</text>
  <text start="628.029" dur="4.11">years would be a total 483 years you</text>
  <text start="630.19" dur="5.1">just you know take sixty nine times</text>
  <text start="632.139" dur="4.831">seven again each week represents seven</text>
  <text start="635.29" dur="4.32">years because it&amp;#39;s the hebrew word of</text>
  <text start="636.97" dur="5.25">Shibuya so each week represents a year</text>
  <text start="639.61" dur="6.75">of seven years of each day a year so</text>
  <text start="642.22" dur="6.479">each week is a year is seven years so 69</text>

  <text start="1755.369" dur="4.62">outnumbered and yet yah divinely</text>
  <text start="1757.44" dur="5.729">intervened and because 1967 was a</text>
  <text start="1759.989" dur="4.711">jubilee the Jews did the impossible they</text>
  <text start="1763.169" dur="3.3">took back Jerusalem for the first time</text>

  <text start="1796.93" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s been going on is</text>
  <text start="1798.43" dur="4.5">Earth folks were at the door we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="1801.07" dur="5.61">the brink and the only reason the only</text>
  <text start="1802.93" dur="6">reason why I&amp;#39;m even teaching on Daniel 9</text>
  <text start="1806.68" dur="6.6">is because the scripture says despise</text>
  <text start="1808.93" dur="7.26">not prophesy and because Daniel 9 shows</text>
  <text start="1813.28" dur="4.44">and proves conclusively that not only is</text>
  <text start="1816.19" dur="4.38">the scripture true because you know</text>
  <text start="1817.72" dur="6.03">Daniel made this prophecy obviously a</text>
  <text start="1820.57" dur="5.52">dozen 20 30 40 50 years after his death</text>
  <text start="1823.75" dur="3.99">at that this decree went forth to</text>
  <text start="1826.09" dur="4.05">rebuild Jerusalem so you made this</text>
  <text start="1827.74" dur="3.99">prophecy well before this decree ever</text>
  <text start="1830.14" dur="3.87">went forth to rebuild Jerusalem in the</text>
  <text start="1831.73" dur="3.72">year 467 bc and then for the morning</text>
  <text start="1834.01" dur="3.45">prophesied when the Messiah would be cut</text>
  <text start="1835.45" dur="3.78">off in 1780 so Daniel makes this</text>
  <text start="1837.46" dur="3.6">prophecy that isn&amp;#39;t even fulfilled for</text>
  <text start="1839.23" dur="4.83">several hundred years later and yet it</text>
  <text start="1841.06" dur="5.22">occurs to the T just as he said it would</text>
  <text start="1844.06" dur="3.78">so it proves that this is an inspired</text>
  <text start="1846.28" dur="3.27">book it proves yahshua&amp;#39;s the Messiah</text>
  <text start="1847.84" dur="4.23">because he&amp;#39;s the only one who fits the</text>
  <text start="1849.55" dur="5.76">the dates and the prophecy given in</text>
  <text start="1852.07" dur="5.28">Daniel 9 and it&amp;#39;s interesting that the</text>
  <text start="1855.31" dur="4.62">Jews in their Talmudic readings of the</text>
  <text start="1857.35" dur="4.8">scriptures will skip over Daniel 9 they</text>
  <text start="1859.93" dur="3.81">won&amp;#39;t read Daniel 9 because they know at</text>
