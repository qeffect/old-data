  <text start="1.46" dur="20.79">hello YouTube good evening shabbat</text>
  <text start="4.98" dur="23.43">shalom it&amp;#39;s friday evening jun 6 2014 12</text>
  <text start="22.25" dur="11.38">I have told YouTube community that i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="28.41" dur="6.27">planning to basically stand in front of</text>
  <text start="33.63" dur="6.019">the Republican National Convention</text>
  <text start="34.68" dur="7.8">Center in st. Paul in September and</text>
  <text start="39.649" dur="4.75">preach to the delegates that stream into</text>
  <text start="42.48" dur="4.53">the convention center trying to convince</text>
  <text start="44.399" dur="4.921">them one last time to abstain from the</text>
  <text start="47.01" dur="4.08">first round of voting so that it would</text>
  <text start="49.32" dur="4.32">be possible for the convention to become</text>
  <text start="51.09" dur="4.83">a brokered convention in which Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="53.64" dur="5.64">can then be nominated and hopefully can</text>
  <text start="55.92" dur="5.549">gain enough delegates through a second</text>
  <text start="59.28" dur="6.659">or even the third round of voting even</text>
  <text start="61.469" dur="7.111">as Abraham Lincoln won the nomination in</text>
  <text start="65.939" dur="4.621">1860 Abraham Lincoln of course went into</text>
  <text start="68.58" dur="4.079">the Republican National Convention with</text>
  <text start="70.56" dur="6.3">basically no delegates much like Ron</text>
  <text start="72.659" dur="7.471">Paul and Seward was the front-runner in</text>
  <text start="76.86" dur="5.46">1860 and Seward was unable to garner</text>
  <text start="80.13" dur="4.41">enough delegates in the first round to</text>
  <text start="82.32" dur="5.85">win the nomination so in the second</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="6.63">round Abraham Lincoln actually won some</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="5.58">delegates over quite enough to win but</text>
  <text start="91.17" dur="4.019">Seward still didn&amp;#39;t win enough and then</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="3.659">the third round enough delegates</text>
  <text start="95.189" dur="4.591">actually voted for Lincoln that allowed</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="3.991">him to become the nominee so he</text>
  <text start="99.78" dur="3.51">literally walked out of the Republican</text>
  <text start="101.4" dur="3.81">National Convention as the Republican</text>
  <text start="103.29" dur="4.17">nominee even though when he walked into</text>
  <text start="105.21" dur="3.99">the nomination into the convention he</text>
  <text start="107.46" dur="4.92">had no delegates so we&amp;#39;re hoping to</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="5.07">accomplish a similar similar type of</text>
  <text start="112.38" dur="4.949">thing with Ron Paul we&amp;#39;re hoping a</text>
  <text start="114.27" dur="5.07">history will repeat and I&amp;#39;m wanting to</text>
  <text start="117.329" dur="3.691">play my little roll by trying to</text>
  <text start="119.34" dur="3.029">convince as many delegates as possible</text>
  <text start="121.02" dur="3.09">as they stream in the convention center</text>
  <text start="122.369" dur="3.631">to abstain in their first round of</text>
  <text start="124.11" dur="3.78">voting so that we can open up the</text>
  <text start="126" dur="4.709">possibility of Ron Paul being nominated</text>
  <text start="127.89" dur="4.59">I wanted to read just a little letter I</text>
  <text start="130.709" dur="2.621">got I&amp;#39;m not going to reveal her name</text>
  <text start="132.48" dur="2.98">because</text>
  <text start="133.33" dur="8.04">I didn&amp;#39;t ask her if I could and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="135.46" dur="7.92">want to hmm break her anonymous</text>
  <text start="141.37" dur="4.17">anonymity if she doesn&amp;#39;t wish it to be</text>
  <text start="143.38" dur="6.36">broken but I want to read this email</text>

  <text start="185.38" dur="4.17">rehearsed well this is our last chance</text>
  <text start="187.63" dur="4.32">to make this happen and everything we do</text>
  <text start="189.55" dur="5.52">has to be done to the absolute best of</text>
  <text start="191.95" dur="4.56">our abilities most importantly this is</text>
  <text start="195.07" dur="3.99">the paragraph I really want to highlight</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="5.13">because I just very encouraged by</text>
  <text start="199.06" dur="4.23">reading this anyway she says most</text>
  <text start="201.64" dur="4.68">importantly we need to keep our hearts</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="5.31">minds and eyes focused on the prize Ron</text>
  <text start="206.32" dur="5.16">Paul winning the Republican nomination</text>
  <text start="208.6" dur="4.44">and then on to win the presidency not on</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="4.05">the draconian circumstances surrounding</text>
  <text start="213.04" dur="5.22">the selection lies in the lack of media</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="4.44">coverage God is with us and Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="218.26" dur="4.5">will be President regardless of how the</text>
  <text start="219.97" dur="6.239">circumstances make it look now Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="222.76" dur="6.09">will win the nomination and will win the</text>
  <text start="226.209" dur="5.101">presidency we just need to stay the</text>
  <text start="228.85" dur="4.58">course thank you for yours iron efforts</text>
  <text start="231.31" dur="6.33">to make him our president all the best I</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="6.1">don&amp;#39;t know about you but that letter she</text>
  <text start="237.64" dur="5.43">sent that to me a few days ago on june</text>
  <text start="239.53" dur="6.3">fourth that letter was just very</text>
  <text start="243.07" dur="7.08">encouraging you know I I hope that more</text>
  <text start="245.83" dur="6.6">Ron Paul supporters could have the type</text>
  <text start="250.15" dur="3.809">of attitude that this that this lady has</text>
  <text start="252.43" dur="2.91">because that&amp;#39;s the type of attitude we</text>
  <text start="253.959" dur="3.9">need to succeed and that&amp;#39;s certainly the</text>
  <text start="255.34" dur="5.76">type of attitude but I want to have as</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="5.581">I&amp;#39;m preparing to raise money to go to</text>
  <text start="261.1" dur="4.2">st. Paul in the first week of September</text>
  <text start="263.44" dur="3.51">to try to to try to convince as many</text>
  <text start="265.3" dur="5.01">delegates as possible to</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="5.64">turn this into a brokered convention so</text>

  <text start="296.44" dur="4.83">Oregon standards but but we are on the</text>
