  <text start="0.35" dur="4.659">Shalom Shalom Shalom this is daniel john</text>
  <text start="3.149" dur="7.141">lee with torah restoration ministries</text>
  <text start="5.009" dur="9.54">website is wwwspa- aa.com it is Friday</text>
  <text start="10.29" dur="6.06">March 14th getting toward it&amp;#39;s the 13th</text>
  <text start="14.549" dur="3.211">day of the twelfth month almost the 14th</text>
  <text start="16.35" dur="3.54">day the twelfth month not only does</text>
  <text start="17.76" dur="4.74">Sabbath start tonight Friday night march</text>
  <text start="19.89" dur="6.299">14th but also the first day of Purim and</text>
  <text start="22.5" dur="5.16">Purim is both tomorrow and Sunday two</text>
  <text start="26.189" dur="4.801">day feast you can read about it in the</text>
  <text start="27.66" dur="5.79">book of Esther it&amp;#39;s very key feast in</text>
  <text start="30.99" dur="6.36">terms of talking about the Antichrist</text>
  <text start="33.45" dur="6.48">Haman was a forerunner for shadow of the</text>
  <text start="37.35" dur="6.72">Antichrist but I want to talk about some</text>
  <text start="39.93" dur="6.359">things that that I&amp;#39;ve been that I was</text>
  <text start="44.07" dur="3.84">going over in my last video the</text>
  <text start="46.289" dur="5.101">abomination of desolation it obviously</text>
  <text start="47.91" dur="4.95">did not happen on March 11th 2014 now</text>
  <text start="51.39" dur="3.63">the assumption that I had that I was</text>
  <text start="52.86" dur="4.949">operating on is that if yash was</text>
  <text start="55.02" dur="7.039">returning in 2017 the abomination of</text>
  <text start="57.809" dur="9.121">desolation would end right here on 9 21</text>
  <text start="62.059" dur="7.6">2017 so if you go 1290 days back and why</text>
  <text start="66.93" dur="5.939">do I go 1290 days back well if you go to</text>
  <text start="69.659" dur="5.221">Daniel chapter 12 you&amp;#39;ll read that the</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="4.441">abomination of desolation last for</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="6.87">exactly 1290 days so if you go exactly</text>
  <text start="77.31" dur="11.15">1290 days back from yom teruah September</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="11.159">21st 2017 you will come to March 11th</text>
  <text start="88.46" dur="6.19">2014 and of course we&amp;#39;ve come and gone</text>
  <text start="92.909" dur="4.831">past March 11 nothing happened there was</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="6.179">no abomination of desolation so then I</text>
  <text start="97.74" dur="5.28">said well maybe what was wrong here is</text>
  <text start="100.829" dur="4.08">that the abomination of desolation would</text>
  <text start="103.02" dur="4.29">continue to go through after the</text>
  <text start="104.909" dur="4.35">resurrection all the way through until</text>
  <text start="107.31" dur="6">you get to yom kippur which is right</text>
  <text start="109.259" dur="8.82">here September 30th 2017 and if you go</text>
  <text start="113.31" dur="5.599">1290 days back from September 30th 2017</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="4.07">then</text>
  <text start="118.909" dur="5.46">you would come to march the 21st march</text>
  <text start="122.149" dur="5.09">twenty actually March twentieth which is</text>
  <text start="124.369" dur="5.851">the spring equinox March twentieth 2014</text>
  <text start="127.239" dur="4.72">there&amp;#39;s something else though and and</text>
  <text start="130.22" dur="4.79">something very interesting about the</text>
  <text start="131.959" dur="12">state by the way I found this article</text>
  <text start="135.01" dur="11.71">from the is this the daily The Daily</text>
  <text start="143.959" dur="6.241">Mail Online mail online to UK</text>
  <text start="146.72" dur="5.04">publication and it&amp;#39;s talking about this</text>
  <text start="150.2" dur="5.509">asteroid it&amp;#39;s going to hurtle toward</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="6.809">Earth and they&amp;#39;re basically saying this</text>
  <text start="155.709" dur="5.441">two-thirds of a mile wide asteroid could</text>
  <text start="158.569" dur="5.461">hit earth on March 21st okay so that</text>
  <text start="161.15" dur="8.19">would be pretty much 1290 days right</text>
  <text start="164.03" dur="7.41">before Yom Kippur of 2017 so if this</text>
  <text start="169.34" dur="4.53">event winds up occurring on Rush 21st</text>
  <text start="171.44" dur="5.31">this could definitely be the abomination</text>
  <text start="173.87" dur="4.29">that God causes desolation because</text>
  <text start="176.75" dur="2.94">certainly if an asteroid of this</text>
  <text start="178.16" dur="3.139">magnitude hit the earth depending on</text>
  <text start="179.69" dur="4.62">where it hits it could cause a lot of</text>
  <text start="181.299" dur="4.56">desolation and then the anti christ the</text>
  <text start="184.31" dur="3.959">son of perdition would emerge from this</text>
  <text start="185.859" dur="6.311">whatever happens once this asteroid hits</text>
  <text start="188.269" dur="5.521">the earth however there&amp;#39;s also another</text>
  <text start="192.17" dur="6.78">possibility that I was thinking about</text>
  <text start="193.79" dur="10.02">and that is if we go to the fee states</text>
  <text start="198.95" dur="6.45">for 2017 so obviously the abomination of</text>
  <text start="203.81" dur="4.5">desolation is not going to end by</text>
  <text start="205.4" dur="5.97">September 21st 2017 otherwise it would</text>
  <text start="208.31" dur="6.09">have started by March 11 2014 if it</text>
  <text start="211.37" dur="6.66">doesn&amp;#39;t start by March twentieth March</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="5.73">21st 2014 then it&amp;#39;s not going to end by</text>
  <text start="218.03" dur="3.929">Yom Kippur either so are there any other</text>
  <text start="220.13" dur="5.3">possibilities of when the abomination of</text>
  <text start="221.959" dur="6.87">desolation could end well the latest</text>
  <text start="225.43" dur="5.08">possibility of yahshua returning 2017</text>
  <text start="228.829" dur="2.821">after the resurrection after we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="230.51" dur="3.24">resurrected to meet him in the air</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="4.32">ladies time of him returning in</text>
  <text start="233.75" dur="4.44">Revelation 19 where he destroys the son</text>
  <text start="235.97" dur="4.049">of perdition with his mouth the</text>
  <text start="238.19" dur="4.62">brightness of his coming would be the</text>
  <text start="240.019" dur="5.93">final day of sukkot of 2017 which that</text>
  <text start="242.81" dur="7.37">year would occur on October twelfth 2017</text>
  <text start="245.949" dur="10.111">so if you go back 1290 days</text>
  <text start="250.18" dur="9.75">from October 12 2017 then you come to</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="5.91">this day right here April first 2014 so</text>
  <text start="259.93" dur="5.43">this is the this day right here is the</text>
  <text start="261.97" dur="6.87">last possible day that the abomination</text>
  <text start="265.36" dur="5.97">of desolation could occur in 2014 could</text>
  <text start="268.84" dur="5.82">begin if Yahshua is going to return in</text>
  <text start="271.33" dur="5.429">2017 now what&amp;#39;s interesting about April</text>
  <text start="274.66" dur="4.74">first this year is that April first is</text>
  <text start="276.759" dur="5.671">not just april fools day but it is the</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="4.35">first day of the hebrew year okay</text>
  <text start="282.43" dur="2.85">because you have pass over here in April</text>
  <text start="283.75" dur="3.65">14th and then you have the first day of</text>
  <text start="285.28" dur="4.35">unleavened bread on April fifteenth</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="4.96">which is when the day that we have that</text>
  <text start="289.63" dur="6.03">blood moon that will be seen from Israel</text>
  <text start="292.36" dur="4.589">as well as many parts of the world and</text>
  <text start="295.66" dur="3.15">then of course you have the seven days</text>
  <text start="296.949" dur="4.25">of unleavened bread starting on April</text>
  <text start="298.81" dur="5.729">fifteenth going for the next seven days</text>
  <text start="301.199" dur="5.291">so that is the new year and also I said</text>
  <text start="304.539" dur="4.38">that the first trumpet which is where a</text>
  <text start="306.49" dur="4.2">third of the the trees are incinerated</text>
  <text start="308.919" dur="4.201">and all the green grass across the earth</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="4.89">is incinerated that third trumpet has to</text>
  <text start="313.12" dur="4.38">blow in the third year of tribulation</text>
  <text start="315.58" dur="4.05">which would in other words would have to</text>
  <text start="317.5" dur="3.81">blow before april first before this the</text>
  <text start="319.63" dur="3.96">beginning of the fourth year of the</text>
  <text start="321.31" dur="5.19">tribulation because if we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="323.59" dur="4.74">final seven years and it began in 2010</text>
  <text start="326.5" dur="5.21">termination 2017 then we&amp;#39;re just about</text>
  <text start="328.33" dur="6.99">to finish the third year here so</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="5.35">basically Tuesday April first this</text>
  <text start="335.32" dur="4.379">abomination of desolation has to go down</text>
  <text start="337.06" dur="4.199">by then a lot of people have been saying</text>
  <text start="339.699" dur="4.801">that with everything that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="341.259" dur="5.581">with in Crimea Ukraine and Russia along</text>
  <text start="344.5" dur="3.659">with the united states that if a nuclear</text>
  <text start="346.84" dur="3.21">war is going to break out it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="348.159" dur="5.94">break out sometime in the next couple of</text>
  <text start="350.05" dur="5.58">weeks here so so this is just some other</text>
  <text start="354.099" dur="3.721">possibilities that i wanted to throw out</text>
  <text start="355.63" dur="5.159">here as we&amp;#39;re about to celebrate perm I</text>
  <text start="357.82" dur="4.589">hope everyone has a very wonderful perm</text>
  <text start="360.789" dur="3.66">you&amp;#39;re supposed to have a wonderful</text>
  <text start="362.409" dur="4.82">feast to celebrate this day it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="364.449" dur="5.491">idea to read through the book of Esther</text>
  <text start="367.229" dur="4.12">which talks about perm it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="369.94" dur="3.96">long of a book you can break it up and</text>
  <text start="371.349" dur="3.991">do a couple of nights read maybe half of</text>
  <text start="373.9" dur="4.65">it tonight the other half tomorrow night</text>
  <text start="375.34" dur="6.18">as a good way to do it so I just wanted</text>
  <text start="378.55" dur="4.619">to throw these possibilities out the</text>
  <text start="381.52" dur="4.35">abomination of desolation in order for</text>
  <text start="383.169" dur="4.5">gosh of return by 2017 the abomination</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="6.359">of desolation has to happen no later</text>
