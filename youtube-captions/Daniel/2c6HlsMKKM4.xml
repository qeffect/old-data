  <text start="209.27" dur="4.26">going to have an opportunity to turn to</text>
  <text start="211.22" dur="4.08">yah but they&amp;#39;re also going to have a</text>
  <text start="213.53" dur="4.02">test a great test at the end of that</text>
  <text start="215.3" dur="3.96">thousand years going to be a lot of</text>
  <text start="217.55" dur="5.34">people on earth at that point you think</text>
  <text start="219.26" dur="6.24">about a thousand years of no war where</text>
  <text start="222.89" dur="4.47">yahshua&amp;#39;s ruling and reigning we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="228.92" dur="4.05">west it&amp;#39;s gonna be a lot of people alive</text>
  <text start="231.47" dur="3.45">at the end of that thousand years and</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="5.1">some point after that hasatan is</text>
  <text start="234.92" dur="5.07">released from the pit and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="238.07" dur="4.74">final rebellion so they&amp;#39;ll still be some</text>
  <text start="239.99" dur="5.04">type of sin hypocrisy going on even in</text>
  <text start="242.81" dur="3.84">the millennial reign although those who</text>
  <text start="245.03" dur="5.13">are a part of the first resurrection on</text>
  <text start="246.65" dur="5.28">yonder up 2017 will you know they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="250.16" dur="6.54">as the Angels ruling and reigning with</text>
  <text start="251.93" dur="6.42">Yahshua here on earth however and the</text>
  <text start="256.7" dur="3.69">new heavens and new earth that happens</text>
  <text start="258.35" dur="4.05">after the millennial reign and after the</text>
  <text start="260.39" dur="3.72">white throne judgment in that final</text>
  <text start="262.4" dur="2.91">ultimate fulfillment of the feast of</text>
  <text start="264.11" dur="4.6">Sukkot</text>
  <text start="265.31" dur="6.22">no more pain no more sin and we&amp;#39;re death</text>
  <text start="268.71" dur="6">nothing it&amp;#39;s all been done away with but</text>
  <text start="271.53" dur="6.33">no more see it&amp;#39;s going to be an awesome</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="6.269">and glorious time and that is what the</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="5.04">piece of sukkot points toward now the</text>
  <text start="280.979" dur="3.87">last day the eighth day of this feast</text>
  <text start="282.9" dur="3.21">also has an interesting fulfillment even</text>
  <text start="284.849" dur="3.451">after that we&amp;#39;ll get to that on the</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="3.869">eighth day it&amp;#39;s going to be an</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="3.869">incredible time and that&amp;#39;s why this</text>
  <text start="289.979" dur="4.74">piece is supposed to be so joyous</text>
  <text start="292.169" dur="5">because it&amp;#39;s basically celebrating the</text>
  <text start="294.719" dur="5.07">renewed heavens and the renewed earth</text>
  <text start="297.169" dur="5.62">it&amp;#39;s eight days long because eight is</text>
  <text start="299.789" dur="5.581">the number for new beginning all through</text>
  <text start="302.789" dur="6.171">scriptures indeed it will be a new</text>
  <text start="305.37" dur="7.079">beginning like nothing you can imagine</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="6.85">now during the feast of Sukkot it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="312.449" dur="5.041">time to know it&amp;#39;s a time to be intimate</text>
  <text start="315.81" dur="3.659">with Yahweh of course we should always</text>
  <text start="317.49" dur="4.139">be intimate with him but since we set</text>
  <text start="319.469" dur="3.75">aside this time especially to be with</text>
  <text start="321.629" dur="2.94">him and to be with others it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="323.219" dur="4.141">good time to hear from him and last</text>
  <text start="324.569" dur="4.35">night as I was in my my sukkah I I</text>
  <text start="327.36" dur="6">received some revelation i want to just</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="8.131">share with you guys briefly in 1st</text>
  <text start="333.36" dur="5.64">chronicles chapter 28 and verse 8 says</text>
  <text start="337.05" dur="4.079">now therefore in the sight of all Israel</text>
  <text start="339" dur="5.009">the Assembly of Yahweh and in the</text>
  <text start="341.129" dur="5.671">hearing of our Elohim be careful to seek</text>
  <text start="344.009" dur="4.321">out all the commandments of Yahweh are</text>
  <text start="346.8" dur="3.75">looking but you may possess this good</text>
  <text start="348.33" dur="4.949">land and leave it as an inheritance for</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="4.619">your children after you forever what</text>
  <text start="353.279" dur="3.901">jumped out at me about that verse was to</text>
  <text start="355.169" dur="3.96">seek out see we&amp;#39;re not supposed to be</text>
  <text start="357.18" dur="3.18">passive about the word and about tore</text>
  <text start="359.129" dur="3.51">our supposed to seek out these</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="3.809">Commandments we shouldn&amp;#39;t wait for other</text>
  <text start="362.639" dur="2.791">people to lead us into those</text>
  <text start="364.169" dur="3.09">Commandments we need to go to the Torah</text>
  <text start="365.43" dur="4.229">ourselves and not just the Torah but the</text>
  <text start="367.259" dur="4.321">entire scriptures from Genesis to</text>
  <text start="369.659" dur="4.021">Revelation we need to seek out his</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="3.809">Commandments there are still things that</text>
  <text start="373.68" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;m continuing to learn about the tour</text>
  <text start="375.389" dur="5.4">on the scriptures and I imagine that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="378.12" dur="4.319">going to go on for eternity we should</text>
  <text start="380.789" dur="3.6">always be seeking out as Commandments to</text>
  <text start="382.439" dur="4.021">do those things that are right and just</text>
  <text start="384.389" dur="6.75">and to please our Father so don&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="386.46" dur="6.569">passive now the other thing that I saw</text>
  <text start="391.139" dur="5.901">which is I think is really neat it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="393.029" dur="7.891">Psalm 16 which is a beautiful song</text>
  <text start="397.04" dur="5.95">in verse 8 it says i have set yahweh</text>
  <text start="400.92" dur="6.21">always before me because he is at my</text>
  <text start="402.99" dur="5.73">right hand and i shall not be moved and</text>
  <text start="407.13" dur="3.87">then skipping down to verse 11 it says</text>
  <text start="408.72" dur="4.77">you will show me the path of life and</text>
  <text start="411" dur="3.72">your presence is fullness of joy and at</text>
  <text start="413.49" dur="5.97">your right hand are pleasures</text>
  <text start="414.72" dur="7.56">forevermore so david says that yahweh is</text>
  <text start="419.46" dur="5.46">on his right hand but then also he says</text>
  <text start="422.28" dur="5.37">that dahveed is also you always right</text>
  <text start="424.92" dur="4.8">hand and I thought about that so if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="427.65" dur="4.07">standing and you always at my right hand</text>
  <text start="429.72" dur="5.34">he has to be facing the other direction</text>
  <text start="431.72" dur="5.02">so that I am at his right hand and then</text>
  <text start="435.06" dur="5.43">a beautiful picture began to form in my</text>
  <text start="436.74" dur="6.78">mind my arm linked with Yahweh&amp;#39;s arm and</text>
