  <text start="52.59" dur="4.5">the rain to come down for you the former</text>
  <text start="54.6" dur="5.729">rain and the latter rain in the first</text>
  <text start="57.09" dur="6.149">month so joel of course is a very</text>
  <text start="60.329" dur="4.44">prophetic book Peter quotes Joel in in</text>
  <text start="63.239" dur="3.24">the beginning of Acts when the day of</text>
  <text start="64.769" dur="3.541">shadow water Pentecost is fulfilled and</text>
  <text start="66.479" dur="3.871">of course Joel&amp;#39;s pointing toward you</text>
  <text start="68.31" dur="4.19">know this time period the the last 2,000</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="5.37">years since the resurrection of Messiah</text>
  <text start="72.5" dur="4.96">but this in particular you know we know</text>
  <text start="75.72" dur="3.57">that the former rain which happens in</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="3.479">the spring time the former rain was</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="3.689">pictured in the outpouring of the Holy</text>
  <text start="80.939" dur="4.11">Spirit at Shabalin or Pentecost 2,000</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="3.631">years ago in Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="85.049" dur="2.851">you know you Yahshua said you know I</text>
  <text start="86.61" dur="3.24">want you to go to Jerusalem I want you</text>
  <text start="87.9" dur="3.81">to stay there and wait for the gift I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="3.51">gonna send my comforter you need this</text>
  <text start="91.71" dur="3.18">empowerment from on high before you can</text>
  <text start="93.36" dur="4.02">go do the Great Commission that I have</text>
  <text start="94.89" dur="4.019">called you to do so he ascends up into</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="3.44">the sky on that fortieth day of the</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="4.771">accounting of the Omer ten days later</text>
  <text start="100.82" dur="4.089">day fifty on Shavuot Pentecost there in</text>
  <text start="103.68" dur="2.79">the upper room and of course the rock</text>
  <text start="104.909" dur="4.761">falls and that is the former rain it</text>
  <text start="106.47" dur="7.53">happens right there in the springtime</text>
  <text start="109.67" dur="6.07">however when that happens that former</text>
  <text start="114" dur="5.189">rain it didn&amp;#39;t happen in the first</text>
  <text start="115.74" dur="6.57">Hebrew month it happened actually</text>
  <text start="119.189" dur="5.43">well Shabbat which is like the beginning</text>
  <text start="122.31" dur="5.099">of the third year a month</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="4.771">so this is specifically talking about an</text>
  <text start="127.409" dur="3.391">event that happens in the first Hebrew</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="3.81">month now the first Hebrew month always</text>
  <text start="130.8" dur="5.76">happens in April late March April</text>
  <text start="133.2" dur="5.22">usually April that&amp;#39;s when the first</text>
  <text start="136.56" dur="3.569">Hebrew month begins that&amp;#39;s when this the</text>
  <text start="138.42" dur="4.53">the year begins is the head of the years</text>
  <text start="140.129" dur="5.011">and is in April sometime in early to</text>
  <text start="142.95" dur="3.869">late April or sometimes rarely but</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="5.489">sometimes actually as early as very late</text>
  <text start="146.819" dur="5.911">March so what&amp;#39;s interesting is that this</text>
  <text start="150.629" dur="3.781">move this outpouring of the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="152.73" dur="3.27">that I&amp;#39;m seeing at Cornerstone and I</text>
  <text start="154.41" dur="4.02">mean it is definitely an outpouring I</text>
  <text start="156" dur="4.38">you know what I saw on Yom Kippur that</text>
  <text start="158.43" dur="5.25">revival Firefall I literally have not</text>
  <text start="160.38" dur="5.219">seen this since well 20 years ago when I</text>
  <text start="163.68" dur="3.45">when I first came to know Yahshua when I</text>
  <text start="165.599" dur="3.871">first surrendered my life to him to him</text>
  <text start="167.13" dur="6.15">with the revival that hit my my church</text>
  <text start="169.47" dur="6.299">down in Texas so but I was drawn to this</text>
  <text start="173.28" dur="4.95">verse through some friends of mine that</text>
  <text start="175.769" dur="3.841">I had met at Cornerstone and in that</text>
  <text start="178.23" dur="3.27">like I thought wow is this the beginning</text>
  <text start="179.61" dur="3.719">of the latter rain is this the first few</text>
  <text start="181.5" dur="3.66">droplets of a lot of rain but was</text>
  <text start="183.329" dur="3.601">interesting it says he&amp;#39;ll cause us train</text>
  <text start="185.16" dur="3.24">to come down the former rain and the</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="3.179">latter rain in the first month</text>
  <text start="188.4" dur="3.69">well that former rain did happen in the</text>
  <text start="190.109" dur="4.051">springtime not not exactly in the first</text>
  <text start="192.09" dur="3.69">month but it happened on the day of shot</text>
  <text start="194.16" dur="5.22">whoa in the third month which is late</text>
  <text start="195.78" dur="5.01">spring so when it says he&amp;#39;s gonna cause</text>
  <text start="199.38" dur="3.389">the rain to come down for you the former</text>
  <text start="200.79" dur="5.55">rain and the latter rain in the first</text>
  <text start="202.769" dur="6.151">month here&amp;#39;s my question for you to</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="4.739">think about and pray about is it</text>
  <text start="208.92" dur="3.569">possible that this move of the Holy</text>
  <text start="211.079" dur="2.52">Spirit were seeing and by the way I</text>
  <text start="212.489" dur="3.511">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s just happening at</text>
  <text start="213.599" dur="5.01">Cornerstone because I read another woman</text>
  <text start="216" dur="4.349">on Facebook who said that she at her</text>
  <text start="218.609" dur="3.901">congregation her messianic congregation</text>
  <text start="220.349" dur="3.871">they also had a Yom Kippur service and</text>
  <text start="222.51" dur="3.99">she said that the weight of the Holy</text>
  <text start="224.22" dur="4.29">Spirit was so heavy and powerful that it</text>
  <text start="226.5" dur="4.349">just it was like nothing she&amp;#39;d ever felt</text>
  <text start="228.51" dur="3.99">before so I think this move is probably</text>
  <text start="230.849" dur="5.04">starting to happen you know in various</text>
  <text start="232.5" dur="5.31">pockets and places across the United</text>
  <text start="235.889" dur="4.771">States and the world in the body of</text>
  <text start="237.81" dur="5.1">Messiah so my question is this these</text>
  <text start="240.66" dur="3.689">first few sprinkles that were feeling of</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="3.72">this just amazing move of the Holy</text>
  <text start="244.349" dur="4.441">Spirit because I really do believe he</text>
  <text start="246.63" dur="3.3">wants to use the Jubilee year 2017 to</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="3">bring a Great Awakening</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="3.66">I always convinced oh well this is the</text>
  <text start="251.79" dur="3.36">year the temples gonna be rebuilt well</text>
  <text start="253.59" dur="3.81">that may or may not be true but you know</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="2.94">more than just the temple being rebuilt</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="3.269">what about</text>
  <text start="258.09" dur="5.07">the temple of the body of Messiah you</text>
  <text start="260.669" dur="4.081">know in Peter about how we&amp;#39;re all lively</text>
  <text start="263.16" dur="3.15">stones being built up into a spiritual</text>
  <text start="264.75" dur="3.84">house and that Yahshua is the chief</text>
  <text start="266.31" dur="4.079">Cornerstone and that we offer these</text>
  <text start="268.59" dur="3.45">spiritual sacrifices of praise made</text>
  <text start="270.389" dur="5.161">except a little - yah through Yahshua</text>
  <text start="272.04" dur="5.879">HaMashiach so what if that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="5.13">this move the holy spirit right here at</text>
  <text start="277.919" dur="5.131">Sukkot 2017 as we&amp;#39;re on the verge of the</text>
  <text start="280.68" dur="4.14">wedding feast the fall feasts we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.05" dur="3.63">starting to feel this ver this move the</text>
  <text start="284.82" dur="4.2">holy spirit we know that&amp;#39;s a jubilee</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="4.35">year I believe Yahshua wants to bring a</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="3.6">last Great Awakening starting on this</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="3.99">Jubilee year because it&amp;#39;s a Jubilee</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="4.41">Jubilee a celebration time so of course</text>
  <text start="295.02" dur="3.6">he would want to bring you know a move</text>
  <text start="297.03" dur="3.74">of a spirit to bring people to</text>
  <text start="298.62" dur="4.92">repentance rather than to bring judgment</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="5.14">so what if we&amp;#39;re gonna continue to</text>
  <text start="303.54" dur="3.93">experience more and more of this</text>
  <text start="305.91" dur="4.14">outpouring of the Holy Spirit this</text>
  <text start="307.47" dur="4.08">renewal and we&amp;#39;re gonna get closer to</text>
  <text start="310.05" dur="3.39">him and we&amp;#39;re gonna you know keep the</text>
  <text start="311.55" dur="3.72">Torah more zealously and we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="313.44" dur="3.84">sinners convert and this is just gonna</text>
  <text start="315.27" dur="4.83">build and build and build for the next</text>
  <text start="317.28" dur="5.609">six months and that when we get to April</text>
  <text start="320.1" dur="5.039">of 2018 when we actually come to the</text>
  <text start="322.889" dur="4.891">first Hebrew month what if that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="325.139" dur="4.441">the latter rain actually pours out now I</text>
  <text start="327.78" dur="3.359">could be wrong maybe maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong</text>
  <text start="329.58" dur="3.72">maybe the latter rains not gonna happen</text>
  <text start="331.139" dur="4.111">next April but I think it&amp;#39;s something to</text>
  <text start="333.3" dur="3.179">think about because it appears at least</text>
  <text start="335.25" dur="3.24">from this verse that that latter rain</text>
  <text start="336.479" dur="4.56">that latter-day outpouring of the Spirit</text>
  <text start="338.49" dur="4.23">that&amp;#39;s gonna pour out on us to bring in</text>
  <text start="341.039" dur="3.481">a final harvest before this Great</text>
  <text start="342.72" dur="3.6">Tribulation it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s supposed to</text>
  <text start="344.52" dur="4.14">happened in the first month this spring</text>
  <text start="346.32" dur="3.659">so I think it would be kind of</text>
  <text start="348.66" dur="3.96">interesting just to watch and wait and</text>
  <text start="349.979" dur="4.41">see and I&amp;#39;ll repost this video I&amp;#39;ll put</text>
  <text start="352.62" dur="4.26">a link of it when we get to April of</text>
  <text start="354.389" dur="4.071">2018 next year which will of course be</text>
  <text start="356.88" dur="3.84">right in the season of Passover</text>
  <text start="358.46" dur="6.269">unleavened bread and first fruits and</text>
  <text start="360.72" dur="6.24">just see see if this is true and if this</text>
  <text start="364.729" dur="5.321">continues to build and then there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="366.96" dur="4.92">this utter unleashing of the Ruach like</text>
  <text start="370.05" dur="4.589">we haven&amp;#39;t seen since the days of Acts</text>
  <text start="371.88" dur="4.53">next April in any case I think whether</text>
  <text start="374.639" dur="5.491">it happens next April or not it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="376.41" dur="5.879">to happen at some spring time first</text>
  <text start="380.13" dur="4.05">Hebrew month which is interesting</text>
  <text start="382.289" dur="4.081">because if you look at the Great</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="3.78">Tribulation and the timing as well you</text>
  <text start="386.37" dur="4.01">know Yahshua says pray that your flight</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="4.34">not be on the Shabbat or in the winter</text>
  <text start="390.38" dur="4.2">because when that happens you&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="392.3" dur="3.99">great tribulation which basically means</text>
  <text start="394.58" dur="4.92">the time of Purim which is late winter</text>
  <text start="396.29" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s Shabbat around paramore per match</text>
  <text start="399.5" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re sort of considered days off but</text>
  <text start="401.3" dur="4.08">maybe an actual weekly Shabbat in late</text>
  <text start="403.16" dur="3.6">winter just before you get to spring but</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="3.24">the abomination of desolation happens</text>
  <text start="406.76" dur="4.38">around that time and the two witnesses</text>
  <text start="408.62" dur="4.14">will start preaching on lamb day because</text>
  <text start="411.14" dur="3.96">that lamb day is always three and a half</text>
  <text start="412.76" dur="4.26">years before Yom drew up in any given</text>
  <text start="415.1" dur="4.32">year so the abomination of desolation</text>
  <text start="417.02" dur="5.49">will happen either just before the first</text>
  <text start="419.42" dur="4.26">month or in the first month so is an</text>
  <text start="422.51" dur="3.12">interesting you know because we say</text>
  <text start="423.68" dur="4.65">where sin abounds grace abounds that</text>
  <text start="425.63" dur="4.26">much more so we know the abomination of</text>
  <text start="428.33" dur="2.76">desolation that kicks off the final</text>
  <text start="429.89" dur="4.11">three and a half years before messiahs</text>
  <text start="431.09" dur="5.67">return will happen in or around just</text>
  <text start="434" dur="4.2">before the first month so it makes sense</text>
  <text start="436.76" dur="2.45">that the latter rain will also happen in</text>
  <text start="438.2" dur="3.3">the same time period</text>
  <text start="439.21" dur="3.49">maybe not in the same year I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="441.5" dur="2.37">saying the latter rain will pour out</text>
  <text start="442.7" dur="3.51">when the abomination of desolation</text>
  <text start="443.87" dur="3.96">happens I&amp;#39;m just saying that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.21" dur="4.65">interesting that they both happen in</text>
  <text start="447.83" dur="4.83">April in in the in the first first</text>
  <text start="450.86" dur="3.81">Hebrew month I wish again it always</text>
  <text start="452.66" dur="5.7">happens in very either late late march</text>
  <text start="454.67" dur="5.16">or sometime in April okay I will make</text>
  <text start="458.36" dur="3.21">sure that I post Ike because I know on</text>
