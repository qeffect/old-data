  <text start="31.08" dur="4.08">festival of Easter or Ishtar</text>
  <text start="33.36" dur="5.82">which is literally named after the pagan</text>
  <text start="35.16" dur="5.34">goddess Ishtar Diana and Fiona Barnett</text>
  <text start="39.18" dur="5.129">talks about this this is one of the</text>

  <text start="48.57" dur="7.32">holiday it has nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="50.34" dur="12.09">Scriptures and then as we go further to</text>
  <text start="55.89" dur="7.739">the year you got that Halloween that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="62.43" dur="4.74">the one that we&amp;#39;re praying against</text>

  <text start="86.25" dur="6">is xmas which is actually the feast of</text>
  <text start="89.4" dur="5.3">Saturnalia it&amp;#39;s a holy pagan holiday in</text>
  <text start="92.25" dur="5.07">fact talks about in Jeremiah chapter 10</text>
  <text start="94.7" dur="4.87">1 through 6 where the heathen would cut</text>
  <text start="97.32" dur="3.63">down the tree bring it into that into</text>
  <text start="99.57" dur="3.36">their dwelling place and deck it with</text>
  <text start="100.95" dur="5.489">gold and silver check it out Jeremiah 10</text>
  <text start="102.93" dur="5.189">one through six and this is also with in</text>
  <text start="106.439" dur="5.011">conjunction with the winter solstice</text>
  <text start="108.119" dur="5.82">this is also a huge high satanic caball</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="8.34">day where they sacrifice multiples they</text>
  <text start="113.939" dur="7.651">a babies so these pagan holidays that</text>
  <text start="119.79" dur="3.179">the Roman Catholic Church adopted to</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="4.83">appeals with pagans and then the</text>
  <text start="122.969" dur="7.281">Protestants continued them and almost</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="3.83">all Christians celebrate these holidays</text>

  <text start="231.81" dur="5.37">fulfilled and we continue to celebrate</text>
  <text start="233.07" dur="9.3">them as we look back on what he did but</text>
  <text start="237.18" dur="6.869">now we come to the fall feasts we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="295.33" dur="5.609">on yom kippur we&amp;#39;re gonna stand on that</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="5.22">sea of fire and glass and he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="300.939" dur="4.44">give us our rewards just like rabbi shul</text>
  <text start="302.83" dur="4.919">apostle paul talks about where he talks</text>
  <text start="305.379" dur="3.84">about how you know some will have hey</text>
  <text start="307.749" dur="2.88">wooden stubble will be burned up but</text>
  <text start="309.219" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;ll be saved is going through a fire</text>
  <text start="310.629" dur="5.25">and others will have built on the</text>
  <text start="313.449" dur="4.321">foundation of Yahshua and will have gold</text>
  <text start="315.879" dur="4.77">and silver and precious jewels and that</text>
  <text start="317.77" dur="4.739">will survive the fire that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="320.649" dur="4.38">important that you know we don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="322.509" dur="5.94">put our trust in Yahshua but we actually</text>
  <text start="325.029" dur="4.89">do things for him because there&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="328.449" dur="4.2">some on this day that yeah you&amp;#39;ll make</text>
  <text start="329.919" dur="4.97">it but you&amp;#39;re not gonna have anything to</text>
  <text start="332.649" dur="5.341">show for what you did</text>
  <text start="334.889" dur="5.5">so Paul encourages us to make sure we</text>
  <text start="337.99" dur="5.009">don&amp;#39;t store up hey wouldn&amp;#39;t stop about</text>
  <text start="340.389" dur="5.7">precious jewels and gold that treasures</text>
  <text start="342.999" dur="4.98">in heaven that will last forever that</text>
  <text start="346.089" dur="3.69">means we take what Yahshua is done for</text>
  <text start="347.979" dur="4.02">us and now we start doing things for him</text>
  <text start="349.779" dur="5.7">we start applying his word to our life</text>
  <text start="351.999" dur="5.07">we obey His commandments his Torah and</text>
  <text start="355.479" dur="4.44">we evangelize and speak to others about</text>
  <text start="357.069" dur="4.59">it and we do things like taking down</text>
  <text start="359.919" dur="5.071">these satanic pedophiles and exposing</text>
  <text start="361.659" dur="5.4">them so will one day stand on that see a</text>
  <text start="364.99" dur="4.349">firing glass and heavenlies will sing</text>
  <text start="367.059" dur="4.621">the song of Moses in the land as it&amp;#39;s</text>
