  <text start="31.59" dur="4.53">remember that you being in times past</text>
  <text start="33.18" dur="5.879">Gentiles in the flesh who are called</text>
  <text start="36.12" dur="4.59">uncircumcision by that which is called</text>
  <text start="39.059" dur="3.66">the circumcision in the flesh made by</text>
  <text start="40.71" dur="4.5">hands that at that time you were without</text>
  <text start="42.719" dur="4.5">Messiah being aliens or foreigners from</text>
  <text start="45.21" dur="3.9">the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers</text>
  <text start="47.219" dur="4.791">from the covenants of promise having no</text>
  <text start="49.11" dur="6.3">hope and without Yahweh in the world</text>
  <text start="52.01" dur="5.29">Ephesians 2 has a basic premise hey you</text>
  <text start="55.41" dur="4.199">believers who are once called Gentiles</text>
  <text start="57.3" dur="5.309">as in the past tense but now you are</text>
  <text start="59.609" dur="5.281">right there along with Israel you were</text>
  <text start="62.609" dur="4.471">once a strange from the Covenant of</text>
  <text start="64.89" dur="5.97">Israel the jobs and titles of the Torah</text>
  <text start="67.08" dur="6.75">along with Israel&amp;#39;s Yahweh but but now</text>

  <text start="73.83" dur="6.21">were far off are made nigh by the blood</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="5.07">of Messiah in other words the</text>
  <text start="80.04" dur="3.719">estrangement from the Torah from you</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="4.14">sorry out from all those jobs and titles</text>
  <text start="83.759" dur="5.911">in the Torah has been abolished through</text>
  <text start="86.13" dur="5.73">the blood of Messiah hallelujah we as</text>
  <text start="89.67" dur="3.39">those who of us were born Gentiles we</text>
  <text start="91.86" dur="4.68">were not born Jews but we were born</text>
  <text start="93.06" dur="5.849">Gentiles in the flesh we can now keep</text>
  <text start="96.54" dur="4.649">the whole Torah just as the rest of the</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="4.111">believing Jews the natural-born Jews who</text>
  <text start="101.189" dur="4.04">now believe in yahushua for the blood of</text>
  <text start="103.02" dur="6.18">messiah paves our way to do so</text>
  <text start="105.229" dur="6.25">hallelujah incidentally this was also a</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="4.379">loud way way way back in the times of</text>
  <text start="111.479" dur="5.881">Moses the same rules in the Mosaic</text>
  <text start="113.579" dur="6.36">Covenant for example Egyptians Rahab the</text>
  <text start="117.36" dur="4.95">harlot Ruth the Moabite us and many</text>
  <text start="119.939" dur="4.741">other pagan Gentiles due to their faith</text>
  <text start="122.31" dur="5.07">in the coming Messiah and is not yet</text>
  <text start="124.68" dur="5.279">shed blood or grafted into Israel and</text>
  <text start="127.38" dur="4.469">we&amp;#39;re no longer considered Gentiles but</text>
  <text start="129.959" dur="3.101">now considered one with user I out and</text>
  <text start="131.849" dur="3.671">we&amp;#39;re expected</text>
  <text start="133.06" dur="5.55">tired to keep every last jot and tittle</text>
  <text start="135.52" dur="4.68">of the tour of Moses that&amp;#39;s why we have</text>
  <text start="138.61" dur="4.11">the commandment in Exodus there will be</text>
  <text start="140.2" dur="4.86">the same law the same Torah for both the</text>
  <text start="142.72" dur="4.849">Jew and the Gentile for both the the</text>
  <text start="145.06" dur="5.3">native-born Israelite and the foreigner</text>
  <text start="147.569" dur="4.931">both the Hebrew and the stranger</text>
  <text start="150.36" dur="4.83">Ephesians 2 shows us that this provision</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="5.069">of north in Torah never passed away</text>
  <text start="155.19" dur="4.18">Yahweh is the same yesterday today and</text>
  <text start="157.569" dur="3.511">forever just as those who were Gentiles</text>
  <text start="159.37" dur="4.649">would place their faith in the coming</text>
  <text start="161.08" dur="5.31">Messiah and is soon to be shed blood and</text>
  <text start="164.019" dur="3.961">so they can be grafted into Israel and</text>
  <text start="166.39" dur="3.84">they were no longer Gentiles so too now</text>
  <text start="167.98" dur="3.99">we can place our faith in the Messiah</text>
  <text start="170.23" dur="3.569">who has already come and in the blood</text>
  <text start="171.97" dur="3.51">that he&amp;#39;s already shed so that we who</text>
  <text start="173.799" dur="3.991">were born Gentiles can be grafted and</text>
  <text start="175.48" dur="5.19">become just like the Jews just like</text>
  <text start="177.79" dur="5.309">Israel we are now longer Gentiles in</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="5.129">fact the word Gentile means one who does</text>
  <text start="183.099" dur="4.741">not have yah one who does not know you</text>
  <text start="185.799" dur="4.291">so we should not even call ourselves</text>
  <text start="187.84" dur="4.619">Gentile anymore we are Israelites when</text>
  <text start="190.09" dur="4.32">we repent and place our faith in Jesus</text>
  <text start="192.459" dur="5.641">Christ of Nazareth we no longer are</text>
  <text start="194.41" dur="6.449">Gentiles we become Israelites and as</text>
  <text start="198.1" dur="4.35">Israelites were now expected to obey the</text>
  <text start="200.859" dur="5.641">commandments given to Israel which is</text>
  <text start="202.45" dur="5.34">the Torah so again Ephesians 2 shows us</text>
  <text start="206.5" dur="3.51">that this provision and tour never</text>
  <text start="207.79" dur="4.88">passed away that Yahshua or Yahweh is</text>
  <text start="210.01" dur="5.16">the same yesterday today and forever</text>
  <text start="212.67" dur="4.78">moving on in Ephesians 2 it says in the</text>
  <text start="215.17" dur="4.11">next verse for he is our peace who have</text>
  <text start="217.45" dur="4.47">made us both one and have broken down</text>
  <text start="219.28" dur="5.1">the middle wall of partition between us</text>
  <text start="221.92" dur="4.439">in other words through the Messiah we</text>
  <text start="224.38" dur="4.199">are all considered Israelites now and</text>
  <text start="226.359" dur="5.671">thus we are all required to obey the</text>
  <text start="228.579" dur="6.421">Torah given to Israel there is no class</text>
  <text start="232.03" dur="4.98">warfare no exclusivity that the wicked</text>
  <text start="235" dur="4.53">fair see achill Jews tried to establish</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="5.28">with their Talmud a rather the written</text>
  <text start="239.53" dur="5.82">Torah is clear that a Gentile may be</text>
  <text start="242.29" dur="4.62">grafted into Israel the partition</text>
  <text start="245.35" dur="3.93">between the Jew and the Gentile was</text>
  <text start="246.91" dur="4.139">destroyed by Torah and now that the</text>
  <text start="249.28" dur="3.81">Torah has been sprinkled in yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.049" dur="6.06">blood we are reminded that this</text>
  <text start="253.09" dur="5.699">partition is still destroyed the next</text>
  <text start="257.109" dur="4.68">verse says having abolished in his flesh</text>
  <text start="258.789" dur="4.951">the enmity even against the law of</text>
  <text start="261.789" dur="4.56">Commandments contained in ordinances for</text>
  <text start="263.74" dur="3.3">to make himself a plain one new man so</text>
  <text start="266.349" dur="3.301">making p</text>
  <text start="267.04" dur="4.5">since shalom now do you think you can</text>
  <text start="269.65" dur="4.74">murder or commit adultery under the New</text>
  <text start="271.54" dur="4.41">Covenant of course not well those are</text>
  <text start="274.39" dur="5.79">ordinances those are laws written in the</text>
  <text start="275.95" dur="6.12">Torah of Moses can we now rape no yet</text>
  <text start="280.18" dur="4.53">this is an ordinance or a law in the</text>
  <text start="282.07" dur="4.53">Torah so does the above verse really say</text>
  <text start="284.71" dur="3.81">that Messiah abolished or did away with</text>
  <text start="286.6" dur="4.41">the written Torah as so many Christians</text>
  <text start="288.52" dur="5.04">try to suggest no of course not that</text>
  <text start="291.01" dur="4.56">makes no logical sense what the above</text>
  <text start="293.56" dur="4.17">verse is saying which harmonizes with</text>
  <text start="295.57" dur="5.19">what we just read before that is this</text>
  <text start="297.73" dur="5.64">hey these ordinances and laws of the</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="5.82">Torah brought condemnation upon us for</text>
  <text start="303.37" dur="5.73">we did not obey them but now that we are</text>
  <text start="306.58" dur="5.04">redeemed by yahshua&amp;#39;s blood those</text>
  <text start="309.1" dur="3.99">ordinances and laws no longer condemn</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="3.33">pneus because through the blood of</text>
  <text start="313.09" dur="4.2">Messiah and His redemptive work within</text>
  <text start="314.95" dur="4.79">us we now have the indwelling of the</text>
  <text start="317.29" dur="5.61">Holy Spirit we have the power to obey</text>
  <text start="319.74" dur="5.44">everything in the Torah we get this</text>
  <text start="322.9" dur="4.14">power from our precious Messiah and the</text>
  <text start="325.18" dur="4.89">indwelling of his ruach hakodesh the</text>
  <text start="327.04" dur="5.94">Holy Spirit this is exactly by the way</text>
  <text start="330.07" dur="5.01">what Ezekiel 11 19 to 20 says that his</text>
  <text start="332.98" dur="3.75">new spirit that he says within us will</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="3.86">cause us to walk in all his laws</text>
  <text start="336.73" dur="4.95">Commandments statutes and ordinances</text>
  <text start="338.94" dur="5.74">this is also what Hebrews 8 reaffirms</text>
  <text start="341.68" dur="4.26">that is Torah his laws will be written</text>
  <text start="344.68" dur="6.24">in our hearts and our minds that we will</text>
  <text start="345.94" dur="7.53">have a inner desire to wear the ZZ to</text>
  <text start="350.92" dur="5.01">wear the head coverings to eat kosher to</text>
  <text start="353.47" dur="4.08">follow the dietary laws to keep the</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="3.36">Sabbath day to keep the beach days to</text>
  <text start="357.55" dur="3.09">love our neighbor to love God to pay ten</text>
  <text start="359.29" dur="3.18">percent of our income to widows and</text>
  <text start="360.64" dur="3.9">orphans to do all the Torah will have an</text>
  <text start="362.47" dur="4.07">inward desire to want to seek it out to</text>
  <text start="364.54" dur="5.85">learn it and to apply it to our lives</text>
  <text start="366.54" dur="6.91">hallelujah again it was the same way way</text>
  <text start="370.39" dur="4.8">back in mosaic times as Moses constantly</text>
  <text start="373.45" dur="4.11">priest about the need to cleave unto</text>
  <text start="375.19" dur="5.76">yahweh in fact the expression cleaving</text>
  <text start="377.56" dur="5.04">under yah is used several times when</text>
  <text start="380.95" dur="4.29">moses gives the torah to the Israelites</text>
  <text start="382.6" dur="5.03">you must cleave unto yah and keep his</text>
  <text start="385.24" dur="5.43">Commandments but what is cleaving mean</text>
  <text start="387.63" dur="6.97">cleaving under Yahweh was Moses&amp;#39;s way of</text>
  <text start="390.67" dur="5.999">saying having faith in ya when you</text>
  <text start="394.6" dur="4.47">Cleveland ayotte means to place absolute</text>
  <text start="396.669" dur="3.661">trust in him in order to keep every jot</text>
  <text start="399.07" dur="3.54">until the Torah</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="5.299">Yahweh never changes and his</text>
  <text start="402.61" dur="7.709">requirements for salvation never change</text>
  <text start="405.629" dur="8.021">Adam and Eve Moses David Daniel Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="410.319" dur="5.731">Nehemiah Apostle Paul and us today were</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="4.38">all saved the same way by placing our</text>
  <text start="416.05" dur="4.23">faith in the blood of Yahshua and is the</text>
  <text start="418.03" dur="3.9">redemptive work and thereby being told</text>
  <text start="420.28" dur="4.439">the spirits that we can now obey his</text>
  <text start="421.93" dur="7.139">commandments the rules of salvation</text>
  <text start="424.719" dur="6.241">never changed verses 16 and 17 of</text>

  <text start="435.129" dur="5.19">abolished the enmity which we once had</text>
  <text start="437.62" dur="4.74">toward the Torah and the enmity the</text>
  <text start="440.319" dur="4.261">Torah had toward us in so far that it</text>
  <text start="442.36" dur="4.589">condemned us making peace not only</text>
  <text start="444.58" dur="4.739">between the Jew and the Gentile but also</text>
  <text start="446.949" dur="6.451">making peace between sinners and the</text>
  <text start="449.319" dur="5.761">Torah they had once refused to obey in</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="3.66">other words when we were wicked and</text>
  <text start="455.08" dur="3.449">didn&amp;#39;t love Yahshua we hated the tour we</text>
  <text start="457.06" dur="3.9">had enmity toward the Torah and the</text>
  <text start="458.529" dur="4.23">Torah hated us the Torah condemned us</text>
  <text start="460.96" dur="4.049">and pointed out all the ways in which we</text>
  <text start="462.759" dur="5.101">were sinful but once we found out with</text>
  <text start="465.009" dur="5.071">Yahshua then by his blood piece was made</text>
  <text start="467.86" dur="4.019">and we fell in love with that very Tori</text>
  <text start="470.08" dur="3.78">we used to hate and the Torah no longer</text>
  <text start="471.879" dur="4.29">condemns us because now we obey it so</text>
  <text start="473.86" dur="4.169">now the tori is ordained unto life for</text>
  <text start="476.169" dur="3.391">us it&amp;#39;s a tree of life because it just</text>
  <text start="478.029" dur="3.661">every time we obeyed the Torah but love</text>
  <text start="479.56" dur="6.18">for Yahshua it just brings us closer and</text>
  <text start="481.69" dur="9.449">closer to Christ it is truly a tree of</text>
  <text start="485.74" dur="8.91">life verses 18 through 22 of Ephesians 2</text>
  <text start="491.139" dur="5.64">as we close out the chapter shows how we</text>
  <text start="494.65" dur="5.34">are grafted in among the believing Jews</text>
  <text start="496.779" dur="5.521">who keep Torah founded upon the master</text>
  <text start="499.99" dur="5.639">Torah keeper himself Yahshua HaMashiach</text>
  <text start="502.3" dur="5.1">and now we do have access to Yahweh&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="510.069" dur="4.801">precious blood and by the indwelling of</text>
  <text start="511.719" dur="6.06">his ruach ha kodesh thus Ephesians 2</text>
  <text start="514.87" dur="5.82">clearly and definitely and certainly</text>
  <text start="517.779" dur="7.351">shows us our obligations to keep the</text>
