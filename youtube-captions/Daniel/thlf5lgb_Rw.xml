  <text start="0.03" dur="4.44">good morning shabbat shalom&amp;#39; at a</text>
  <text start="1.68" dur="6.06">Saturday morning December the 2nd 2017</text>
  <text start="4.47" dur="5.73">is now the 14th day of the ninth Hebrew</text>
  <text start="7.74" dur="4.769">month we were only 11 days now until</text>
  <text start="10.2" dur="4.319">Hanukkah which begins on the night of</text>
  <text start="12.509" dur="5.331">December 12th going into December 13th</text>
  <text start="14.519" dur="6.301">this year and lasts until December 20th</text>
  <text start="17.84" dur="5.109">major news events going on so I had said</text>
  <text start="20.82" dur="4.53">mentioned last week that Trump had until</text>
  <text start="22.949" dur="4.141">December 1st until the next six-month</text>
  <text start="25.35" dur="3.929">deadline came up for him to move the</text>
  <text start="27.09" dur="4.529">American Embassy from Tel Aviv to</text>
  <text start="29.279" dur="3.541">Jerusalem and to recognize Jerusalem as</text>
  <text start="31.619" dur="3.96">the capital of the world this would be</text>
  <text start="32.82" dur="5.73">another campaign promise that he</text>
  <text start="35.579" dur="5.25">promised he would do that would cause</text>
  <text start="38.55" dur="4.47">the world to be destabilized possibly if</text>
  <text start="40.829" dur="4.8">he did this maybe lead to a major Middle</text>
  <text start="43.02" dur="5.609">East war and I was wondering in light of</text>
  <text start="45.629" dur="4.921">his decision right after the new moon to</text>
  <text start="48.629" dur="3.721">declare North Korea a state-sponsored</text>
  <text start="50.55" dur="4.56">Charis list if he would have the courage</text>
  <text start="52.35" dur="4.229">to finally fulfill his campaign promise</text>
  <text start="55.11" dur="5.28">and move the embassy from Tel Aviv to</text>
  <text start="56.579" dur="5.16">Israel December first came and went that</text>
  <text start="60.39" dur="3.39">was the deadline but I just found out</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="3.331">that because it fell on a Friday the</text>
  <text start="63.78" dur="3.12">deadline is actually extended until</text>
  <text start="65.07" dur="2.28">Monday December 4th so he has until</text>
  <text start="66.9" dur="2.73">Monday</text>
  <text start="67.35" dur="4.68">December 4th to make the decision as to</text>
  <text start="69.63" dur="4.71">whether to sign the waiver to keep the</text>
  <text start="72.03" dur="4.62">Embassy in Tel Aviv which he did back in</text>
  <text start="74.34" dur="4.11">May or to fulfill his campaign promise</text>
  <text start="76.65" dur="4.109">to give in to the pressure put upon him</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="4.62">by the Senate and the Congress and on</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="4.441">his supporters and to move that embassy</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="3.479">from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and also</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="3.239">recognized Jerusalem as the capital of</text>
  <text start="86.549" dur="5.07">Israel if he does this this would cause</text>
  <text start="88.439" dur="4.591">major destabilization of Middle East so</text>
  <text start="91.619" dur="3.061">the he has until December 4th to do that</text>
  <text start="93.03" dur="3.75">and then also last night Friday night</text>
  <text start="94.68" dur="5.369">going into Saturday morning it has been</text>
  <text start="96.78" dur="5.67">reported that Israel has struck Damascus</text>
  <text start="100.049" dur="5.871">they have struck a Iranian facility</text>
  <text start="102.45" dur="6">about 8 miles southwest of Damascus and</text>
  <text start="105.92" dur="5.019">I guess sir he was able to intercept a</text>
  <text start="108.45" dur="4.489">couple of those missiles but but several</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="5.46">other missiles did reach the target and</text>
  <text start="112.939" dur="6.521">evidently Israel destroyed this Iranian</text>
  <text start="116.399" dur="5.04">facility that it looks like the Iranian</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="4.619">facility was not manned yet it had just</text>
  <text start="121.439" dur="5.491">been newly built and was about to go</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="5.311">online and Israel destroyed it so Israel</text>
  <text start="126.93" dur="4.5">struck Syria struck very close to</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="4.14">Damascus destroyed an Iranian facility</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="4.38">this would be the first time Israel</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="4.77">war planes have gone into Syria and and</text>
  <text start="135.81" dur="5.55">directly destroyed an Iranian major</text>
  <text start="138.3" dur="5.1">Iranian military base Israel has made it</text>
  <text start="141.36" dur="4.68">very clear they will not tolerate Iran</text>
  <text start="143.4" dur="4.32">to establish a presence in Syria they</text>
  <text start="146.04" dur="4.38">say that&amp;#39;s unacceptable they&amp;#39;ve told</text>
  <text start="147.72" dur="5.269">that to Russia to Syria and to Iran and</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="6.24">so last night it looks like Israel did</text>
  <text start="152.989" dur="7.661">escalate the conflict by attacking this</text>
  <text start="156.66" dur="5.85">Iranian base now so far Syria and Russia</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="4.68">and Iran haven&amp;#39;t really made any type of</text>
  <text start="162.51" dur="5.31">public response other than to say that</text>
  <text start="165.33" dur="7.409">you know Israel did carry out the attack</text>
  <text start="167.82" dur="6.48">in the Iranian facility was hit the</text>
  <text start="172.739" dur="3.78">question is is this going to escalate</text>
  <text start="174.3" dur="4.019">into something major we know that you</text>
  <text start="176.519" dur="4.291">know of course they&amp;#39;re always serious</text>
  <text start="178.319" dur="5.161">always a huge powder keg it&amp;#39;s been that</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="5.19">way for a long time since 2011 and</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="5.64">really since 2013 so Syria has always</text>
  <text start="186" dur="5.819">been a powder keg Israel directly</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="4.5">attacking Iranian facilities in Syria is</text>
  <text start="191.819" dur="3.721">this going to escalate to something more</text>
  <text start="193.62" dur="4.649">and could Trump&amp;#39;s announcement on</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="4.77">December 4th should he decide to fulfill</text>
  <text start="198.269" dur="3.72">his campaign promise and not sign the</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="3.3">waiver and actually move the embassy</text>
  <text start="201.989" dur="2.761">from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognize</text>
  <text start="203.61" dur="3.599">Jerusalem as the capital of the world</text>
  <text start="204.75" dur="4.829">could both of these events lead to a</text>
  <text start="207.209" dur="5.31">major Middle East conflict which would</text>
  <text start="209.579" dur="5.16">then lead to Israel subduing her enemies</text>
  <text start="212.519" dur="3.901">and possibly setting up an altar or</text>
  <text start="214.739" dur="4.59">temple with animal sacrifices by</text>
  <text start="216.42" dur="5.01">Hanukkah I&amp;#39;m gonna keep a very close eye</text>
  <text start="219.329" dur="5.071">on these events because you know we only</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="4.23">have 11 days now till Hanukkah if the</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="3.3">Great Tribulation were to begin next</text>
  <text start="225.66" dur="4.799">winter I would expect some sort of altar</text>
  <text start="227.7" dur="5.19">or temple to be at least dedicated by</text>
  <text start="230.459" dur="5.28">Hanukkah with animal sacrifices</text>
  <text start="232.89" dur="6.21">beginning shortly thereafter so we have</text>
  <text start="235.739" dur="6.271">11 days until that time period is here</text>
  <text start="239.1" dur="5.34">and we&amp;#39;ve now seen this major escalation</text>
  <text start="242.01" dur="4.92">with Israel destroying an Iranian</text>
  <text start="244.44" dur="3.66">facility in Syria and now Trump on the</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="3.41">verge of deciding whether he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="248.1" dur="4.29">move the embassy from Tel Aviv Israel so</text>
  <text start="250.34" dur="5.05">really want to see what&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>
  <text start="252.39" dur="5.279">because I think whatever happens in this</text>
  <text start="255.39" dur="3.54">chain of events that would lead to the</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="3.091">demise of the United States if it were</text>
  <text start="258.93" dur="3.239">to happen in the next three months we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="4.32">gonna see a major Middle East conflict</text>
  <text start="262.169" dur="4.201">first and that will sort of lead to</text>
  <text start="265.08" dur="2.58">other things so</text>
