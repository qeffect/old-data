  <text start="72.75" dur="4.29">gracious enough to use my iPad to film</text>
  <text start="75.299" dur="4.171">me so that you know we could post it up</text>

  <text start="82.56" dur="3.54">suggestions of different places I could</text>
  <text start="84.09" dur="4.59">read and preach from so it was a great</text>
  <text start="86.1" dur="5.19">time of course you know you had the</text>

  <text start="91.29" dur="4.53">really happy that we were there others</text>
  <text start="92.549" dur="4.831">were really upset which you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.82" dur="2.759">kind of what happened when Paul and the</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="3.09">other apostles we&amp;#39;re not preaching in</text>
  <text start="98.579" dur="4.32">the book of Acts it says some believed</text>
  <text start="100.47" dur="6.689">and some really hated what Paul was</text>
  <text start="102.899" dur="6.18">doing so but it was it was a joy now</text>
  <text start="107.159" dur="3.57">unfortunately this week josh is not</text>
  <text start="109.079" dur="2.551">going to be able to come out he has some</text>
  <text start="110.729" dur="4.89">of the things that he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="5.489">doing on the Sabbath so um it looks like</text>
  <text start="115.619" dur="3.631">I&amp;#39;m gonna have to go out alone I you</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="4.381">know the congregation I go to they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="119.25" dur="4.439">been really really good about praying</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="3.63">for me but I can&amp;#39;t really haven&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="123.689" dur="3.151">gotten anyone want to actually come out</text>
  <text start="125.13" dur="3.42">physically with me and you know Yahshua</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="4.77">did send its disciples out two by two</text>
  <text start="128.55" dur="4.45">but you also have you know some of those</text>
  <text start="131.61" dur="3.58">creatures out there some of</text>
  <text start="133" dur="4.47">prophets out there preaching alone you</text>
  <text start="135.19" dur="4.26">know and of course I know even if I</text>
  <text start="137.47" dur="5.24">don&amp;#39;t have another person with me I have</text>
  <text start="139.45" dur="5.19">Yasha with me I have a spirit with me so</text>
  <text start="142.71" dur="4.51">not going to go to the abortion clinic</text>
  <text start="144.64" dur="5.13">this time and I go to another place in</text>
  <text start="147.22" dur="6.3">in Portland to preach probably going to</text>
  <text start="149.77" dur="6.27">be more people there so just keep me in</text>
  <text start="153.52" dur="4.8">prayer and continue to keep me in prayer</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="3.45">as I go out every week to do street</text>
  <text start="158.32" dur="2.91">preaching I want to hit a lot of the</text>
  <text start="159.49" dur="4.95">different summer events that are going</text>
  <text start="161.23" dur="4.83">to be coming up and I figure Sabbath is</text>
  <text start="164.44" dur="4.14">like the perfect day to preach because</text>
  <text start="166.06" dur="4.41">this is the day but Yahshua would preach</text>
  <text start="168.58" dur="4.29">in the synagogue&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just the day</text>
  <text start="170.47" dur="4.769">when Yasha would heal it&amp;#39;s a day of</text>
  <text start="172.87" dur="5.52">ministry it&amp;#39;s the day if you read an</text>
  <text start="175.239" dur="7.231">Ezekiel I think it&amp;#39;s Ezekiel 46 if you</text>
  <text start="178.39" dur="7.08">read in Ezekiel that eastern door of the</text>
  <text start="182.47" dur="5.58">tabernacle is only open twice it&amp;#39;s open</text>
  <text start="185.47" dur="4.769">during every weekly Shabbat from Friday</text>
  <text start="188.05" dur="4.26">night to Saturday night and it&amp;#39;s open on</text>
  <text start="190.239" dur="5.281">the New Moon&amp;#39;s a new moons can happen</text>
  <text start="192.31" dur="7.26">any day of the week so that eastern</text>
  <text start="195.52" dur="6.27">heavenly door is swung wide open every</text>
  <text start="199.57" dur="3.84">Shabbat and gives us revelation extra</text>
  <text start="201.79" dur="3.24">revelation extra conviction of the</text>
  <text start="203.41" dur="3.51">spirit of for preaching two centers and</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="3.959">hypocrites to get them to repent extra</text>
  <text start="206.92" dur="6.72">revelation for the Saints to edify them</text>
  <text start="208.989" dur="6.75">I put a post up late last night on my</text>
  <text start="213.64" dur="3.45">facebook and basically the post I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="215.739" dur="3.541">kind of paraphrasing but it basically</text>
  <text start="217.09" dur="4.679">said you know we&amp;#39;re either two types of</text>
  <text start="219.28" dur="4.23">people we&amp;#39;re either righteous and</text>
  <text start="221.769" dur="3.78">heading toward Yahshua and allowing him</text>
  <text start="223.51" dur="4.62">to transform us more and more into his</text>
  <text start="225.549" dur="4.801">image or we&amp;#39;re wicked and we&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="228.13" dur="5.19">away from young and we&amp;#39;re becoming more</text>
  <text start="230.35" dur="4.38">and more like a beast there&amp;#39;s only two</text>
  <text start="233.32" dur="3.72">types of people in the world righteous</text>
  <text start="234.73" dur="4.02">or wicked which one are you are you</text>
  <text start="237.04" dur="3.63">heading more toward yeah shua learning</text>
  <text start="238.75" dur="3.42">more about who he is and trying to</text>
  <text start="240.67" dur="3.42">please him more and love your neighbor</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="4.62">and learn more about his word and apply</text>
  <text start="244.09" dur="4.32">it more to your life or are you just</text>
  <text start="246.79" dur="3.509">interested in yourself and in your sin</text>
  <text start="248.41" dur="4.859">and you may even have religious</text>
  <text start="250.299" dur="6.391">trappings but in the end you&amp;#39;re living</text>
  <text start="253.269" dur="5.34">for yourself there&amp;#39;s only two types of</text>
  <text start="256.69" dur="4.139">people in the world right to Sir wicked</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="4.321">and you know that really becomes evident</text>
  <text start="260.829" dur="5.101">when you go out street preaching there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.93" dur="3.51">a reason why the Apostles the disciples</text>
  <text start="265.93" dur="2.55">of Yash</text>
  <text start="266.44" dur="5.16">to use street preaching all through the</text>
  <text start="268.48" dur="5.46">book of Acts because it is a very</text>
  <text start="271.6" dur="3.66">anointed form of ministry because it</text>
  <text start="273.94" dur="2.94">really separates the sheep from the</text>
  <text start="275.26" dur="3.33">goats it really shows people who they</text>
  <text start="276.88" dur="7.77">are it really brings conviction of sin</text>
  <text start="278.59" dur="8.46">in an amazing way the prophets used</text>
  <text start="284.65" dur="3.96">street preaching back in the days of the</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="2.76">Tanakh the old what the Christians have</text>
  <text start="288.61" dur="4.02">called the Old Testament they know they</text>
  <text start="289.81" dur="5.49">would stand right there in the gates of</text>
  <text start="292.63" dur="4.2">the wall the city remote fact all cities</text>
  <text start="295.3" dur="3.39">back in ancient Israel they were they</text>
  <text start="296.83" dur="3.54">were surrounded by walls and then you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="298.69" dur="2.97">have one gate leading in and out of the</text>
  <text start="300.37" dur="3.96">city and that&amp;#39;s where all the traffic</text>
  <text start="301.66" dur="4.74">would come through and you read Isaiah</text>
  <text start="304.33" dur="3.81">and Jeremiah and Zechariah these</text>
  <text start="306.4" dur="3.99">prophets they would stand in the gates</text>
  <text start="308.14" dur="6">of the city right where all the traffic</text>
  <text start="310.39" dur="5.94">would come come in and out and of course</text>
  <text start="314.14" dur="4.11">then you go through fast-forward to the</text>
  <text start="316.33" dur="3.45">book of Acts you have so many examples</text>
  <text start="318.25" dur="4.56">you know Peter of course preaching on</text>
  <text start="319.78" dur="6.45">the day of SH a boat right there in in</text>
  <text start="322.81" dur="5.91">downtown Jerusalem right there near the</text>
  <text start="326.23" dur="5.189">temple and then you have Apostle Paul</text>
  <text start="328.72" dur="4.89">going to Mars Hill you know up in up in</text>
  <text start="331.419" dur="5.191">Athens Mars Hill was where all these</text>
  <text start="333.61" dur="4.83">philosophers would congregate and he</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="3.57">went up and stood up in the open air and</text>
  <text start="338.44" dur="4.62">started preaching and you know the first</text>
  <text start="340.18" dur="4.77">thing Paul said was not jesus loves you</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s not what he said not Yahshua</text>
  <text start="344.95" dur="3.21">loves you the first thing he said was I</text>
  <text start="346.45" dur="4.29">perceive that you are all very</text>
  <text start="348.16" dur="4.77">superstitious now that that was</text>
  <text start="350.74" dur="4.77">basically an insult because these are</text>
  <text start="352.93" dur="5.37">the major mega philosophers of the day</text>
  <text start="355.51" dur="4.86">who thought they knew at all um and</text>
  <text start="358.3" dur="5.22">basically Paul saying you know what guys</text>
  <text start="360.37" dur="4.74">you guys are betcha fools you basically</text>
  <text start="363.52" dur="5.25">are about to believe a bunch of</text>
  <text start="365.11" dur="6.24">superstitious mythology and then he</text>
  <text start="368.77" dur="4.35">continued to proceed he used that hook</text>
  <text start="371.35" dur="3.6">that really good hook of you know they</text>
  <text start="373.12" dur="3.63">had all these stone monuments around and</text>
  <text start="374.95" dur="4.02">there was one monument dedicated to the</text>
  <text start="376.75" dur="3.72">unknown God and Paul said I&amp;#39;m gonna tell</text>
  <text start="378.97" dur="3">you about what that unknown God is and</text>
  <text start="380.47" dur="3.449">then he just started preaching and of</text>
  <text start="381.97" dur="3.51">course some believed on him and wanted</text>
  <text start="383.919" dur="3.091">to hear more some believed on Yahshua</text>
  <text start="385.48" dur="2.85">and what Paul was preaching I wanted to</text>
  <text start="387.01" dur="3.27">hear more and others we just thought</text>
  <text start="388.33" dur="4.2">Paul was a fool but you know it&amp;#39;s by the</text>
  <text start="390.28" dur="4.35">foolishness of preaching by the</text>
  <text start="392.53" dur="6.26">foolishness of preaching that yah has</text>
  <text start="394.63" dur="6.9">decided to to win men over to him to</text>
  <text start="398.79" dur="6.28">to bring repentance to bring conviction</text>
  <text start="401.53" dur="6.18">of sin again yas not interested in how</text>
  <text start="405.07" dur="3.81">much we know okay all the knowledge of</text>
  <text start="407.71" dur="3.45">the head knowledge he&amp;#39;s interested in</text>
  <text start="408.88" dur="5.03">our hearts do we love them or don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="411.16" dur="6.599">are we interested in pleasing him or not</text>
  <text start="413.91" dur="5.71">and in America today most people whether</text>
  <text start="417.759" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re religious or not tend to be very</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="6.51">proud very arrogant very independent</text>
  <text start="423.009" dur="4.951">very i can do things on my own even in</text>
  <text start="426.13" dur="3.96">the religious rooms you have a lot of</text>
  <text start="427.96" dur="5.4">people who are oh yeah of course I still</text>
  <text start="430.09" dur="5.25">sin I sent all the time no no first John</text>
  <text start="433.36" dur="4.76">36 or 11 says if you&amp;#39;re truly living for</text>
  <text start="435.34" dur="5.07">yah you&amp;#39;re not going to be sinning and</text>
  <text start="438.12" dur="5.41">that&amp;#39;s what gives us the authority to</text>
  <text start="440.41" dur="4.95">judge to make judgments to go out and</text>
  <text start="443.53" dur="3.449">call people to repentance because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="445.36" dur="3.36">not living in sin we&amp;#39;ve been set free</text>
  <text start="446.979" dur="4.201">and now we want to tell others what</text>
  <text start="448.72" dur="4.35">needs to be done to be to get set free</text>
  <text start="451.18" dur="5.16">and that is repentance and of course</text>
  <text start="453.07" dur="8.01">absolute faith and trust in Yahshua</text>
