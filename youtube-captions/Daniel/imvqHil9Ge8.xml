  <text start="90.99" dur="5.73">there was absolutely amazing something</text>
  <text start="94.229" dur="6.721">I&amp;#39;ve been praying for and hoping for</text>
  <text start="96.72" dur="6.6">four years but almost had lost even the</text>

  <text start="106.29" dur="5.789">well since 2007 2008 I&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="110.04" dur="4.38">about how the Messianic Jewish movement</text>
  <text start="112.079" dur="3.241">the Hebrew roots movement the Israelite</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="3.18">movement whatever you want to call it</text>

  <text start="120.119" dur="3.691">in the leadership and I&amp;#39;ve detailed that</text>
  <text start="122.04" dur="3.539">many of my articles on my website and</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="4.19">this has been going on for years even</text>
  <text start="125.579" dur="6.781">before I started declaring it in</text>
  <text start="128" dur="5.38">2007-2008 and so by and large the</text>
  <text start="132.36" dur="5.46">Messianic movement had</text>
  <text start="133.38" dur="8.7">this empty husk and yesterday excuse me</text>
  <text start="137.82" dur="5.91">two days ago on the Sabbath day this man</text>
  <text start="142.08" dur="3.42">was up there he started preaching and he</text>
  <text start="143.73" dur="3.42">started talking about all the corruption</text>
  <text start="145.5" dur="3.99">and sin and wickedness it was almost as</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="4.05">if he was speaking the very words that</text>
  <text start="149.49" dur="3.24">yah had given me for this movement for</text>
  <text start="151.2" dur="6.39">so long and no one had ever heard or</text>
  <text start="152.73" dur="6.9">listened and then as he began to finish</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="5.88">his preaching in the spirit of yaad just</text>
  <text start="159.63" dur="5.49">started to descend in conviction he</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="5.76">called for people to come up and repent</text>
  <text start="165.12" dur="8.31">and just in a mass rush almost the</text>
  <text start="169.23" dur="6.12">entire congregation ran toward the altar</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="7.5">weeping and crying out for repentance</text>
  <text start="175.35" dur="7.74">even the pastor&amp;#39;s wife it was repentance</text>
  <text start="180.93" dur="4.32">true genuine repentance like you would</text>
  <text start="183.09" dur="3.9">read in the letters of Charles Finney</text>
  <text start="185.25" dur="3.42">back in the 19th century or you would</text>
  <text start="186.99" dur="3.81">read about there were great revivals</text>
  <text start="188.67" dur="4.86">that hit America back with John Wesley</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="4.68">and charles spurgeon it was right there</text>
  <text start="193.53" dur="4.65">and a messianic jewish congregation</text>
