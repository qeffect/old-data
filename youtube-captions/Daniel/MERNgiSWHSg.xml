  <text start="10.95" dur="6.21">hallelujah is the 23rd Sabbath now since</text>
  <text start="14.61" dur="4.71">the Hebrew shemitah year began back in</text>
  <text start="17.16" dur="5.49">April early April can&amp;#39;t believe its</text>
  <text start="19.32" dur="5.67">hearty the 23rd Shabbat I&amp;#39;m just going</text>

  <text start="30.769" dur="5.56">couple days ago a book called the foxes</text>
  <text start="34.89" dur="4.349">Book of Martyrs this is something that i</text>
  <text start="36.329" dur="4.681">read actually many many many years ago I</text>
  <text start="39.239" dur="5.131">think it was when I was in high school</text>
  <text start="41.01" dur="5.639">or just out of high school but I went</text>
  <text start="44.37" dur="5.599">ahead and bought it again because my</text>
  <text start="46.649" dur="6.691">pastor at the congregation that I attend</text>
  <text start="49.969" dur="4.84">recommended it and I also just want to</text>
  <text start="53.34" dur="4.59">recommend it to any of you guys out</text>
  <text start="54.809" dur="4.711">there as well because this foxes Book of</text>
  <text start="57.93" dur="4.469">Martyrs it goes through from the very</text>
  <text start="59.52" dur="6.24">beginning the first century all the way</text>
  <text start="62.399" dur="6.411">up until when Fox John Fox who wrote</text>
  <text start="65.76" dur="6.75">this book lived which is he lived in the</text>
  <text start="68.81" dur="6.46">1500s so basically charts from the first</text>
  <text start="72.51" dur="5.46">century all the way to the midst of the</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="5.94">Protestant Reformation all the different</text>
  <text start="77.97" dur="5.34">martyrs and it starts with the of course</text>
  <text start="81.21" dur="4.049">the original twelve disciples the</text>
  <text start="83.31" dur="5.489">Apostles and then it goes from there and</text>
  <text start="85.259" dur="8.011">I&amp;#39;ve only just begun I&amp;#39;m only on my page</text>
  <text start="88.799" dur="6.241">60 of this book and it&amp;#39;s kind of going</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="5.25">through the Inquisition at this point</text>
  <text start="95.04" dur="7.439">but it&amp;#39;s very very inspiring to just see</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="6.779">how the spirit of yacht falls upon so</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="7.591">many of these people who are burned to</text>
  <text start="105.299" dur="6.39">death or tortured in various ways but</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="3.299">how the spirit just comes upon them and</text>
  <text start="111.689" dur="4.68">they they just start rejoicing and</text>
  <text start="113.369" dur="5.161">praising yah and lifting him up and and</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="6.18">just glorifying him even in the midst of</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="6.299">basically getting killed for him since</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="4.801">we know we&amp;#39;re getting close to the Great</text>
  <text start="124.829" dur="4.32">Tribulation we&amp;#39;re on the cusp of a lot</text>
  <text start="127.35" dur="4.36">of tribulation that&amp;#39;s headed down the</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="4.931">pike toward Christendom</text>
  <text start="131.71" dur="5.21">I think this is a very appropriate book</text>
  <text start="134.08" dur="5.13">to read in this day and age of course I</text>
  <text start="136.92" dur="4.45">don&amp;#39;t think God wants any of us to</text>
  <text start="139.21" dur="4.47">become martyrs I don&amp;#39;t think this is his</text>
  <text start="141.37" dur="5.04">will for us because he said in Luke 21</text>
  <text start="143.68" dur="4.41">pray that you be accounted worthy to</text>
  <text start="146.41" dur="4.59">escape all these things that are to come</text>
  <text start="148.09" dur="4.38">to pass and no that doesn&amp;#39;t mean he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="151" dur="4.35">going to take us out in a</text>
  <text start="152.47" dur="4.62">pre-tribulation rapture but what it does</text>
  <text start="155.35" dur="4.02">mean is that we can pray to have that</text>
  <text start="157.09" dur="3.93">promise of Philadelphia so that even the</text>
  <text start="159.37" dur="3.96">midst of tribulation you can be</text>
  <text start="161.02" dur="4.74">protected and preserved now there is a</text>
  <text start="163.33" dur="4.74">passage in revelation 12 it talks about</text>
  <text start="165.76" dur="4.98">the woman who flees into the wilderness</text>
  <text start="168.07" dur="5.37">for three and a half years and she is</text>
  <text start="170.74" dur="4.47">she&amp;#39;s protected and so my prayer is</text>
  <text start="173.44" dur="4.5">always to be a part of that woman that</text>
  <text start="175.21" dur="3.99">is able to be protected in the</text>
  <text start="177.94" dur="4.68">wilderness during that three and a half</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="5.94">year period which again falls right in</text>
  <text start="182.62" dur="5.64">line with Luke 21 where Yahshua says</text>
  <text start="185.14" dur="5.88">pray that that you can escape all these</text>
  <text start="188.26" dur="6.21">things and that you can stand before the</text>
  <text start="191.02" dur="5.85">Son of Man but nevertheless we should</text>
  <text start="194.47" dur="3.78">still have the heart of if we are to be</text>
  <text start="196.87" dur="4.44">martyred if we do have to be martyred</text>
  <text start="198.25" dur="5.51">that we&amp;#39;re willing to do that that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="201.31" dur="5.66">willing to stand up for Yahshua sake</text>
  <text start="203.76" dur="5.35">because I think what&amp;#39;s happened</text>
  <text start="206.97" dur="4.84">especially in America is our our</text>
  <text start="209.11" dur="9.56">Christian culture Messianic culture has</text>
  <text start="211.81" dur="10.14">become so comfortable so relaxed just</text>
  <text start="218.67" dur="6.61">persecutions pretty much foreign to</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="5.13">American Christianity and this foxes</text>
  <text start="225.28" dur="6.26">Book of Martyrs really puts things in</text>
  <text start="227.08" dur="7.05">perspective I mean it shows that even</text>
  <text start="231.54" dur="4.96">those of us are on the front lines and</text>
  <text start="234.13" dur="4.29">are preaching and and and really</text>
  <text start="236.5" dur="4.56">standing up for our faith we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="238.42" dur="4.47">gone through anything like what what</text>
  <text start="241.06" dur="5.4">these early believers went through in</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="6.84">terms of the torture and the ultimately</text>
  <text start="246.46" dur="5.03">the death that many of them suffered so</text>
  <text start="249.73" dur="4.86">I just want to encourage you with that</text>
  <text start="251.49" dur="6.999">continue to keep jerry nine prayers we</text>
  <text start="254.59" dur="7.64">go to the park and we go preaching the</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="3.741">people do gather in the evenings</text>
  <text start="262.3" dur="4.24">sometimes there&amp;#39;s just a few out there</text>
  <text start="264.05" dur="4.11">and then as the Sun gets more and more</text>
  <text start="266.54" dur="3.69">closer towards setting more and more</text>
