  <text start="211.15" dur="4.339">oh this article continues to go on but</text>
  <text start="212.92" dur="4.86">basically the point is you can see</text>
  <text start="215.489" dur="4.33">Mueller already knew that there was</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="4.019">absolutely nothing nothing that</text>

  <text start="226.75" dur="6.15">many cases based off this massive light</text>
  <text start="230.109" dur="5.85">so you know just complete and total</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="7.35">fraud which in a lot of ways should</text>
  <text start="235.959" dur="5.731">invalidate the elections of last last</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="4.5">fall but I think what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="5.609">is they&amp;#39;re going to show that there was</text>
  <text start="244.75" dur="4.38">voter fraud going on in the midterms</text>
  <text start="247.299" dur="3.631">which is sort of a separate issue from</text>
  <text start="249.13" dur="2.72">this but that there was voter fraud</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="2.21">going on and</text>
  <text start="251.85" dur="3.78">there will eventually be special</text>
  <text start="253.14" dur="4.26">elections in the house once this goes</text>
  <text start="255.63" dur="3.93">for it it&amp;#39;s already been a reporter now</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="7.29">it&amp;#39;s already been going into several</text>
  <text start="259.56" dur="7.7">ports across the nation so I just I</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="6">wanted to highlight this story because</text>

  <text start="443.409" dur="5.1">abortion laws the ACLU of Utah yeah</text>
  <text start="446.59" dur="4.259">there are of course planning there their</text>
  <text start="448.509" dur="3.81">comeback so I wanted to highlight this</text>
  <text start="450.849" dur="3.361">as well obviously if I mean my personal</text>
  <text start="452.319" dur="4.41">opinion is abortion needs to be outlawed</text>
  <text start="454.21" dur="5.85">completely and totally all the way up to</text>
  <text start="456.729" dur="5.071">week zero right not week 18 but I wanted</text>
  <text start="460.06" dur="3.569">to highlight this because again we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="461.8" dur="4.91">just seeing this domino effect of state</text>
  <text start="463.629" dur="5.88">after state after state after state</text>
  <text start="466.71" dur="5.049">pushing back against the infanticide</text>
  <text start="469.509" dur="5.551">pushing back against this baby murder</text>
  <text start="471.759" dur="4.981">and whether it&amp;#39;s gets challenged or not</text>
  <text start="475.06" dur="3.24">it probably will be because we&amp;#39;ve seen a</text>
  <text start="476.74" dur="3.81">challenge in other states as well we saw</text>
  <text start="478.3" dur="3.839">a challenge in Kentucky we&amp;#39;ve seen a</text>
  <text start="480.55" dur="2.609">challenge in Mississippi we&amp;#39;ve seen a</text>
  <text start="482.139" dur="3.03">challenge in a variety of different</text>
  <text start="483.159" dur="3.66">states but whether it gets challenged or</text>
  <text start="485.169" dur="3.24">not if it does get challenged my hope</text>
  <text start="486.819" dur="3.361">again is that it gets shot up all the</text>
  <text start="488.409" dur="3.81">way up to the Supreme Court and the</text>
  <text start="490.18" dur="3.409">Supreme Court is gonna have to deal with</text>
  <text start="492.219" dur="4.651">this issue</text>
  <text start="493.589" dur="5.98">so hallelujah this is a this is a</text>
