  <text start="78.45" dur="4.91">parable that Yahshua tells and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="80.549" dur="5.551">about this unjust steward who really has</text>

  <text start="121.619" dur="3.93">best of the situation</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="5.341">and then Yahshua says he says look you</text>
  <text start="125.549" dur="3.781">know the the children of the world this</text>
  <text start="127.89" dur="3.27">unjust steward they you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="2.7">they&amp;#39;re wiser when it comes to the</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="3.54">things of the world</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="4.02">than the children of the light are and</text>
  <text start="134.7" dur="3.03">then he makes this really weird</text>
  <text start="136.05" dur="5.07">statement that I&amp;#39;ve never understood he</text>
  <text start="137.73" dur="5.82">says make you sup make makey yourselves</text>

  <text start="145.95" dur="4.32">everlasting habitations that&amp;#39;s like that</text>
  <text start="148.08" dur="4.77">sounds kind of weird and then he goes on</text>
  <text start="150.27" dur="4.7">to say you know if you&amp;#39;re faithful in</text>
  <text start="152.85" dur="5.55">least then I&amp;#39;ll entrust you with much</text>
  <text start="154.97" dur="5.86">but if you can&amp;#39;t even basically take</text>
  <text start="158.4" dur="5.7">care of the unrighteous mammon or the</text>
  <text start="160.83" dur="5.1">little things the least things that how</text>
  <text start="164.1" dur="5.04">do you expect me to trust you with the</text>
  <text start="165.93" dur="5.1">major things in heaven which to me</text>
  <text start="169.14" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s saying very clearly you know the</text>
  <text start="171.03" dur="4.05">scripture says whatsoever your hand</text>
  <text start="173.16" dur="4.829">finds to do do with all your might so if</text>
  <text start="175.08" dur="4.68">you&amp;#39;re working for you know you know the</text>
  <text start="177.989" dur="3.511">unrighteous Mammon you&amp;#39;re working for</text>
  <text start="179.76" dur="3.509">the world we&amp;#39;re just centered on</text>
  <text start="181.5" dur="3.18">themselves but you&amp;#39;re you know it&amp;#39;s part</text>
  <text start="183.269" dur="3.75">of your business career and you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="184.68" dur="4.559">that you&amp;#39;re not to work as under them</text>
  <text start="187.019" dur="4.111">your work is in the yah and you behave</text>
  <text start="189.239" dur="3.301">wisely sort of like that unjust Stuart</text>
  <text start="191.13" dur="3.96">you know you do the best you can and</text>
  <text start="192.54" dur="4.949">then if you&amp;#39;re faithful in that little</text>
  <text start="195.09" dur="4.23">bit you know then he&amp;#39;ll of trust you as</text>
  <text start="197.489" dur="3.601">much but you&amp;#39;re not working for the</text>
  <text start="199.32" dur="3.03">Mammon okay that&amp;#39;s not your God you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="3.51">not working for the boss you&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="202.35" dur="4.169">for yeah and and you want to be a good</text>
  <text start="204.6" dur="3.72">testimony to your boss and a good</text>
  <text start="206.519" dur="3.631">testimony to others by being faithful</text>
  <text start="208.32" dur="3.06">and and Yahshua says look if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="210.15" dur="2.97">faithful in these little business things</text>
  <text start="211.38" dur="3.69">you know because making money is the</text>
  <text start="213.12" dur="3.81">American dollar is very least when it</text>
  <text start="215.07" dur="3">comes to eternal things but if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.93" dur="3.39">faithful in those little things so won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="218.07" dur="4.32">trust you as much in eternity but then</text>
  <text start="220.32" dur="5.28">he then gives a warning he says you know</text>
  <text start="222.39" dur="4.409">you can&amp;#39;t serve Mammon and me you got to</text>
  <text start="225.6" dur="4.47">choose one of the other because if you</text>
  <text start="226.799" dur="4.53">served Mammon you&amp;#39;re gonna miss it so he</text>
  <text start="230.07" dur="2.759">gives a warning because he says yes you</text>
  <text start="231.329" dur="3.211">need to be faithful and be a good</text>
  <text start="232.829" dur="3.961">example and work the best you can with</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="5.069">these people in the world or worldly</text>
  <text start="236.79" dur="3.99">bosses but don&amp;#39;t lose sight of who</text>
  <text start="239.609" dur="2.94">you&amp;#39;re working for you&amp;#39;re working for</text>
  <text start="240.78" dur="4.56">yah and and and it&amp;#39;s not about making</text>
  <text start="242.549" dur="4.801">money on earth to pay bills or get goods</text>
  <text start="245.34" dur="3.84">but it&amp;#39;s about being a faithful good</text>
  <text start="247.35" dur="3.57">witness like when I go and work at my</text>
  <text start="249.18" dur="3.179">job</text>
  <text start="250.92" dur="2.879">for real estate I&amp;#39;m not a real estate</text>
  <text start="252.359" dur="3.391">agent but I set appointments for real</text>
  <text start="253.799" dur="5.011">estate agents you know I always say</text>
  <text start="255.75" dur="5.82">every day yeah help me to work as good</text>
  <text start="258.81" dur="4.44">as I can at this job and it&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="3.24">Yahshua says hey you&amp;#39;re faithful and</text>
  <text start="263.25" dur="2.6">least I&amp;#39;ll then and trust you with the</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="2.87">real things which is when</text>
  <text start="265.85" dur="3.33">you know we rule and reign with him but</text>
  <text start="267.68" dur="3.3">he gives a warning in that he says you</text>
  <text start="269.18" dur="3.63">know as you&amp;#39;re doing the best you can</text>
  <text start="270.98" dur="3.21">and you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re you know being like</text>
  <text start="272.81" dur="3.3">that unjust steward where you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="274.19" dur="3.36">the best you can and you try to be the</text>
  <text start="276.11" dur="3.75">best testimony possible in in these</text>
  <text start="277.55" dur="3.57">worldly matters don&amp;#39;t lose sight that</text>
  <text start="279.86" dur="2.67">you&amp;#39;re doing this for yacht and don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="281.12" dur="3.27">start becoming in love with ma&amp;#39;am and</text>
  <text start="282.53" dur="3.9">yourself so then all of a sudden I</text>
  <text start="284.39" dur="5.43">realized oh there&amp;#39;s a warning embedded</text>
  <text start="286.43" dur="4.65">this he says yes be wise you know do the</text>
  <text start="289.82" dur="2.79">best you can so I can entrust you much</text>
  <text start="291.08" dur="3.12">but don&amp;#39;t lose sight of what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="292.61" dur="3.39">doing and that&amp;#39;s why he says because if</text>
  <text start="294.2" dur="4.5">you do if you start becoming friends and</text>
  <text start="296" dur="4.5">with Mammon or you start serving ma&amp;#39;am</text>
  <text start="298.7" dur="3.27">and rather than yah and you start</text>
  <text start="300.5" dur="4.2">becoming like the very world that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="301.97" dur="4.2">working with then they&amp;#39;ll receive you</text>
  <text start="304.7" dur="3.6">into everlasting habitations when you</text>
  <text start="306.17" dur="3.39">fail you&amp;#39;re gonna go - you know - not a</text>
  <text start="308.3" dur="5.22">good place so there&amp;#39;s a warning and</text>
  <text start="309.56" dur="5.79">better than that so I think there&amp;#39;s sort</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="3.9">of a multi-layered message number one he</text>
  <text start="315.35" dur="4.11">says boy a lot of these worldly people</text>
  <text start="317.42" dur="3.99">are more wise when it comes to dealing</text>
  <text start="319.46" dur="3.03">with with the business world than you</text>
  <text start="321.41" dur="4.23">know the children of light which is a</text>
  <text start="322.49" dur="5.43">shame and then he says he&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="325.64" dur="3.66">reminding us hey you know as children of</text>
  <text start="327.92" dur="4.02">like you need to be working to the best</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="5.46">of your ability whether it&amp;#39;s a so-called</text>
  <text start="331.94" dur="4.64">spiritual thing or not you know if</text>
  <text start="334.76" dur="3.69">you&amp;#39;re working for our worldly boss or</text>
  <text start="336.58" dur="3.55">clients for an employer you do the best</text>
  <text start="338.45" dur="3.87">you can but then there&amp;#39;s another warning</text>
  <text start="340.13" dur="4.29">that says but in doing that don&amp;#39;t start</text>
  <text start="342.32" dur="3.27">falling in love with Mammon and making</text>
  <text start="344.42" dur="4.23">that your God because you can&amp;#39;t serve</text>
  <text start="345.59" dur="5.51">both so there&amp;#39;s like several layers to</text>
  <text start="348.65" dur="5.07">this parable so I think the takeaway is</text>
  <text start="351.1" dur="5.08">when we doubt our jobs first of all we</text>
  <text start="353.72" dur="2.82">should not spiritual eyes part of our</text>
  <text start="356.18" dur="2.1">lives</text>
  <text start="356.54" dur="3.66">oh it&amp;#39;s spiritual to do Sukkot but then</text>
  <text start="358.28" dur="3.66">when I finish the code go back to my job</text>
  <text start="360.2" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s somehow not spiritual no everything</text>
  <text start="361.94" dur="4.14">we do is spiritual everything whether</text>
  <text start="363.92" dur="5.43">I&amp;#39;m working at a job or cooking a meal</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="5.58">or taking out the trash or cleaning the</text>
  <text start="369.35" dur="5.04">church or doing Sukkot or praying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="371.66" dur="5.1">all spiritual it&amp;#39;s all you know David</text>
  <text start="374.39" dur="3.87">King David always inquired of yah Saul</text>
  <text start="376.76" dur="3.63">was very presumptuous he&amp;#39;d always jump</text>
  <text start="378.26" dur="3.78">ahead and not but David always waited</text>
  <text start="380.39" dur="2.82">and sought yah on every decision he made</text>
  <text start="382.04" dur="3.33">and that&amp;#39;s how we should be no matter</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="4.26">what yeah I helped me to cook this meal</text>
  <text start="385.37" dur="3.99">yeah I helped me to go do groceries yeah</text>
  <text start="387.47" dur="3.6">help me as I work at my job my world a</text>
  <text start="389.36" dur="5.1">job and make this unrighteous mammon and</text>
  <text start="391.07" dur="4.83">you know be a good testimony help me so</text>
  <text start="394.46" dur="3.3">there&amp;#39;s that but then there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="395.9" dur="3.69">warning that says as you excel in your</text>
  <text start="397.76" dur="3.27">job and you prosper don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="399.59" dur="3.18">in love with this ma&amp;#39;am and this money</text>
  <text start="401.03" dur="3.57">that so many other people in the world</text>
  <text start="402.77" dur="3.96">are driven by because then you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="404.6" dur="5.52">really miss it and you&amp;#39;re gonna you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="406.73" dur="4.5">gonna wind up in the wrong spot and then</text>
  <text start="410.12" dur="3.33">he says hey if you&amp;#39;re faithful in the</text>
  <text start="411.23" dur="3.42">least which that&amp;#39;s what making money is</text>
  <text start="413.45" dur="2.97">it&amp;#39;s the least if you&amp;#39;re faithful in</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="4.17">these little things I&amp;#39;ll make sure to</text>
  <text start="416.42" dur="4.17">put you in charge of the real things</text>
  <text start="418.82" dur="3.09">when you rule and reign with me so</text>
  <text start="420.59" dur="2.88">there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sort of a multi-layered</text>
  <text start="421.91" dur="3.33">thing so I think we need to make sure</text>
  <text start="423.47" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re doing the best we can at our jobs</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="4.47">obviously we work with integrity and we</text>
  <text start="428.15" dur="3.75">do the best we can with those who are</text>
  <text start="429.71" dur="3.69">you know of the world and don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="431.9" dur="3.57">Yahshua and it&amp;#39;s a testimony to them as</text>
  <text start="433.4" dur="4.11">well so that&amp;#39;s there we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="435.47" dur="3.69">make money our God you know money is</text>
  <text start="437.51" dur="4.2">simply a tool to serve you and to</text>
  <text start="439.16" dur="4.62">promote his kingdom in fact whenever we</text>
  <text start="441.71" dur="4.91">do make money we&amp;#39;re commanded to give</text>
  <text start="443.78" dur="5.64">10% our first 10% to widows and orphans</text>
  <text start="446.62" dur="5.53">and then another 10% we put aside for</text>
  <text start="449.42" dur="4.68">the feast days and then technically a</text>
  <text start="452.15" dur="3.18">third 10% will go to Levites but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.1" dur="3.3">no Levites so you know those can go to</text>
  <text start="455.33" dur="3">your pastor or whatever congregations</text>
  <text start="457.4" dur="3.24">ministering to you because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="458.33" dur="3.66">supposed to be in a local body but yeah</text>
  <text start="460.64" dur="2.58">we&amp;#39;re supposed to take our first fruits</text>
  <text start="461.99" dur="3.51">or increase and give it to you anyway</text>
  <text start="463.22" dur="4.44">and that keeps us from you know making</text>
  <text start="465.5" dur="3.93">money our God and then we just trust in</text>
  <text start="467.66" dur="3.54">him you know and if we&amp;#39;re faithful and</text>
  <text start="469.43" dur="3.24">those little things then he&amp;#39;ll he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="471.2" dur="3.6">entrust us with the great things when we</text>
  <text start="472.67" dur="4.86">you know when we rule and reign with him</text>
  <text start="474.8" dur="3.87">during the Millennial Kingdom so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.53" dur="2.28">that</text>
  <text start="478.67" dur="4.2">and then there&amp;#39;s this warning you know</text>
  <text start="479.81" dur="5.73">don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t lose sight and and so so</text>
  <text start="482.87" dur="4.29">there&amp;#39;s that and then you know standing</text>
  <text start="485.54" dur="4.53">tall you know one thing that I really</text>
  <text start="487.16" dur="4.8">and blessed that with my job and even</text>
  <text start="490.07" dur="3.75">when I interviewed you know over two</text>
  <text start="491.96" dur="3.39">years ago to work the right I wanted to</text>
