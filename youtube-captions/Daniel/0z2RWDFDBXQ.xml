  <text start="60.18" dur="6.03">morning chat with Daniel E is Yas timing</text>
  <text start="63.019" dur="4.931">you know I&amp;#39;ve talked about it before how</text>
  <text start="66.21" dur="3.42">yah cares about every little detail of</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="4.29">our lives not just our quote unquote</text>
  <text start="69.63" dur="5.18">spiritual life but every little detail</text>
  <text start="72.24" dur="5.1">of our lives and it behooves us as</text>
  <text start="74.81" dur="5.379">people who are following after him and</text>
  <text start="77.34" dur="4.74">trying to obey His commandments and and</text>
  <text start="80.189" dur="3.811">obeying his Commandments and walking in</text>
  <text start="82.08" dur="3.69">righteousness that we understand that</text>
  <text start="84" dur="3.119">everything we go through we should be</text>
  <text start="85.77" dur="3.54">lifting up in prayer and talking with</text>
  <text start="87.119" dur="3.93">him throughout the day because he does</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="3.72">care about every little detail of our</text>
  <text start="91.049" dur="3.93">lives no matter what it might be about</text>
  <text start="93.03" dur="5.1">whether it&amp;#39;s grocery shopping or going</text>
  <text start="94.979" dur="6.75">to work or our family life or whatever</text>
  <text start="98.13" dur="6.239">it might be and that really hit home on</text>
  <text start="101.729" dur="4.861">Passover the the day of password of the</text>
  <text start="104.369" dur="5.18">day of the preparation for Passover</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="6.87">which was on on Thursday April the the</text>
  <text start="109.549" dur="6.161">21st I was out and about running a bunch</text>
  <text start="113.46" dur="4.89">of errands you know d leavening my car</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="4.67">and vacuuming it out in buying things</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="4.619">and just getting everything ready for</text>
  <text start="120.38" dur="5.699">for the Passover dinner that night and</text>
  <text start="122.969" dur="6.421">as I&amp;#39;m sort of scrambling running around</text>
  <text start="126.079" dur="4.561">I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m talking to y&amp;#39;all and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="3.02">just guiding me and</text>
  <text start="130.64" dur="6.69">and his timing is perfect wherever he</text>
  <text start="132.41" dur="6.63">leads me in every way as long as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="137.33" dur="3.48">submitted to him and our heart is in the</text>
  <text start="139.04" dur="3.3">right place of loving him and as long as</text>
  <text start="140.81" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re doing all we know to keep his</text>
  <text start="142.34" dur="4.92">Commandments he&amp;#39;s going to guide us now</text>
  <text start="145.01" dur="3.51">if we&amp;#39;re walking in sin for doing things</text>
  <text start="147.26" dur="2.82">we know we shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing that</text>
  <text start="148.52" dur="3.68">things are going to be chaotic because</text>
  <text start="150.08" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re literally fighting against reality</text>
  <text start="152.2" dur="5.62">okay yah is the source of all reality he</text>
  <text start="155.36" dur="3.66">created everything so if we&amp;#39;re living in</text>
  <text start="157.82" dur="3.63">sin if we&amp;#39;re doing things we know we</text>
  <text start="159.02" dur="3.66">shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing then we&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
  <text start="161.45" dur="2.91">against reality and things get chaotic</text>
  <text start="162.68" dur="3.09">in our life and maybe not immediately</text>
  <text start="164.36" dur="3.15">because the scripture says sin is</text>
  <text start="165.77" dur="4.34">pleasurable before season but eventually</text>
  <text start="167.51" dur="5.009">it catches up to you and you begin to</text>
  <text start="170.11" dur="4.81">reap what you&amp;#39;ve sown but in the same</text>
  <text start="172.519" dur="3.871">way if you&amp;#39;re sewing righteousness if</text>
  <text start="174.92" dur="3.12">you&amp;#39;re walking its Commandments and</text>
  <text start="176.39" dur="2.849">loving him and doing all you can then</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="3.75">you begin to reaped in the other</text>
  <text start="179.239" dur="4.231">direction you begin to reap a piece in</text>
  <text start="181.79" dur="4.169">Shalom and righteousness and man I</text>
  <text start="183.47" dur="4.799">really tasted that this past Passover</text>
  <text start="185.959" dur="4.471">day because what could have been a very</text>
  <text start="188.269" dur="3.871">chaotic day because I had so many things</text>
  <text start="190.43" dur="3.24">I had to do and so many I had to clean</text>
  <text start="192.14" dur="3.9">my entire apartment get all the leaven</text>
  <text start="193.67" dur="6.84">out really turn into a very peaceful</text>
  <text start="196.04" dur="7.289">calm day because for example when I went</text>
  <text start="200.51" dur="5.37">to this one particular store to get some</text>
  <text start="203.329" dur="6.511">groceries I had forgotten a few things</text>
  <text start="205.88" dur="6.329">in my car that I needed but I bought the</text>
  <text start="209.84" dur="4.02">groceries I went back to my car put the</text>
  <text start="212.209" dur="3.421">groceries in the trunk grab what i</text>
  <text start="213.86" dur="3.689">needed went back and because of that</text>
  <text start="215.63" dur="5.1">delay I wound up running into this</text>
  <text start="217.549" dur="4.861">family that you know the guy was wearing</text>
  <text start="220.73" dur="3.24">a key button and blues easy and I was</text>
  <text start="222.41" dur="2.82">able to interact with him which was</text>
  <text start="223.97" dur="4.2">pretty amazing and he was from out of</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="4.41">town so if I hadn&amp;#39;t forgotten the stuff</text>
  <text start="228.17" dur="3.18">in the car then I wouldn&amp;#39;t have run into</text>
  <text start="229.64" dur="3.96">this person and the timing would have</text>
  <text start="231.35" dur="4.32">been off so I began to realize you know</text>
  <text start="233.6" dur="5.28">even if I think oh I forgot this or I</text>
  <text start="235.67" dur="5.099">didn&amp;#39;t do that it&amp;#39;s yah is is is putting</text>
  <text start="238.88" dur="3.72">you exactly where you need to be when</text>
  <text start="240.769" dur="3.69">you need to be and it&amp;#39;s just it causes</text>
  <text start="242.6" dur="4.29">you to have this huge calming effect</text>
  <text start="244.459" dur="4.321">another sort of issue that happened was</text>
  <text start="246.89" dur="4.08">toward the end of the day as I was about</text>
  <text start="248.78" dur="4.41">to get back home finishing all my</text>
  <text start="250.97" dur="4.109">errands I thought me and I really wish i</text>
  <text start="253.19" dur="3.9">had some of those website cards that i</text>
  <text start="255.079" dur="4.291">used to pass out when I you know talk to</text>
  <text start="257.09" dur="3.899">individuals and I was like man I really</text>
  <text start="259.37" dur="3.85">need to order some well when I got home</text>
  <text start="260.989" dur="4.661">and as I&amp;#39;m obeying the commandment</text>
  <text start="263.22" dur="5.04">to unleavened my home lo and behold</text>
  <text start="265.65" dur="4.05">right behind my microwave I find a stack</text>
  <text start="268.26" dur="5.58">of my cards that had been there for</text>
  <text start="269.7" dur="5.79">probably a few years so those types of</text>
  <text start="273.84" dur="3.48">things just continue to happen and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="3.75">just so amazing because yaad does care</text>
  <text start="277.32" dur="4.08">about the little details of your life</text>
  <text start="279.24" dur="4.08">one of the things that we discussed last</text>
  <text start="281.4" dur="4.35">night when I went to this Passover</text>
  <text start="283.32" dur="4.05">Exodus 12 meal with with this precious</text>
  <text start="285.75" dur="5.58">family last night up in the coastal</text>
  <text start="287.37" dur="5.31">mountains is not only yeah carrying</text>
  <text start="291.33" dur="3.9">about every detail of our life but also</text>
  <text start="292.68" dur="5.55">the desires of your heart and overcoming</text>
  <text start="295.23" dur="4.89">you know obstacles or enemies spiritual</text>
  <text start="298.23" dur="3.63">enemies or enemies in your life and and</text>
  <text start="300.12" dur="4.65">and capturing those desires of your</text>
  <text start="301.86" dur="5.34">heart of course we read in Psalm 37 that</text>
  <text start="304.77" dur="4.08">if we delight in yah we&amp;#39;d like to do his</text>
  <text start="307.2" dur="4.05">will and delight in him he will grant</text>
  <text start="308.85" dur="4.44">the desires of our heart because if our</text>
  <text start="311.25" dur="3.66">heart is right and we are truly loving</text>
  <text start="313.29" dur="3.42">yah with all our heart soul mind and</text>
  <text start="314.91" dur="5.009">strength loving our neighbors ourselves</text>
  <text start="316.71" dur="6.209">then the desires that spring out of that</text>
  <text start="319.919" dur="4.591">will be from you but there is a measure</text>
  <text start="322.919" dur="3.811">of faith because if you remember the</text>
  <text start="324.51" dur="4.38">story there was that King whom the</text>
  <text start="326.73" dur="4.41">Prophet came to and said look smite the</text>
  <text start="328.89" dur="4.41">ground and keeps mining it because as</text>
  <text start="331.14" dur="3.99">you smite it so yah will deliver you and</text>
  <text start="333.3" dur="5.49">so the King smote the ground three times</text>
  <text start="335.13" dur="5.58">and the Prophet rebuked him and said</text>
  <text start="338.79" dur="4.5">from yo why don&amp;#39;t you only smite the</text>
  <text start="340.71" dur="4.95">ground three times if you had smitten</text>
  <text start="343.29" dur="3.96">the ground six or seven times with all</text>
  <text start="345.66" dur="3.03">your heart and my strength you would</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="2.88">have subdued all your enemies and all</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="2.82">the Philistines and all the enemies of</text>
  <text start="350.13" dur="3">Israel would have been subdued and</text>
  <text start="351.51" dur="2.76">destroyed but because you only spent the</text>
  <text start="353.13" dur="3.539">ground three times you&amp;#39;re only going to</text>
  <text start="354.27" dur="4.14">get a measure of victory why don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="356.669" dur="4.621">to measure or half measure victory I</text>
  <text start="358.41" dur="4.59">want a full victory a full deliverance a</text>
  <text start="361.29" dur="3.06">full crossing over of the Jordan at</text>
  <text start="363" dur="2.7">every River my life I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="364.35" dur="3.69">smite the ground just three times but</text>
  <text start="365.7" dur="4.26">six or seven times and that&amp;#39;s what y&amp;#39;all</text>
  <text start="368.04" dur="4.08">looking for that faith to wrestle with</text>
  <text start="369.96" dur="3.959">him like Jacob wrestled with Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="3.24">to say I&amp;#39;m gonna wrestle with you and</text>
  <text start="373.919" dur="3.75">grab ahold of you till I get that</text>
  <text start="375.36" dur="4.559">blessing and that&amp;#39;s how we should be and</text>
  <text start="377.669" dur="4.921">you know in my personal life of course</text>
  <text start="379.919" dur="4.051">I&amp;#39;m praying for a breakthrough with with</text>
  <text start="382.59" dur="4.05">my novel and I&amp;#39;m praying for a</text>
  <text start="383.97" dur="5.67">breakthrough with finding a godly wife</text>
  <text start="386.64" dur="4.92">who who loves who loves you and I think</text>
  <text start="389.64" dur="4.2">Yas beginning to open up that door as</text>
  <text start="391.56" dur="3.53">well and I&amp;#39;m praying for continued</text>
  <text start="393.84" dur="4.549">success and</text>
  <text start="395.09" dur="6.329">and growing success at my job in real</text>
  <text start="398.389" dur="4.731">estate and you know in every area of my</text>
  <text start="401.419" dur="3.841">life I&amp;#39;m praying for these breakthroughs</text>
  <text start="403.12" dur="5.32">and also with other friends in my life</text>
  <text start="405.26" dur="4.92">and it requires that faith of just</text>
  <text start="408.44" dur="3.78">saying okay yeah I&amp;#39;m gonna grab a hold</text>
  <text start="410.18" dur="3.81">of the horns of the altar and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="412.22" dur="4.68">gonna let go I&amp;#39;m not gonna let go of you</text>
  <text start="413.99" dur="4.95">Yahshua until that blessing comes and of</text>
  <text start="416.9" dur="4.35">course then using those blessings to</text>
  <text start="418.94" dur="5.699">bless him back that&amp;#39;s very key because</text>
  <text start="421.25" dur="4.86">you notice in in the Torah ya always</text>
  <text start="424.639" dur="3.811">would warn his people he said you know</text>
  <text start="426.11" dur="4.26">when you become fat and flourishing and</text>
  <text start="428.45" dur="3.21">blessings you got the oil on the wine</text>
  <text start="430.37" dur="3.33">everything that&amp;#39;s what people get lazy</text>
  <text start="431.66" dur="3.36">and that&amp;#39;s when you stop thanking me and</text>
  <text start="433.7" dur="4.41">you stop and then it leads a doll manner</text>
  <text start="435.02" dur="5.369">of sin we know that in Romans 1 lack of</text>
  <text start="438.11" dur="6.42">thanksgiving is the first sort of step</text>
  <text start="440.389" dur="6.571">toward a very depraved lifestyle so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="444.53" dur="4.5">very very very very important that when</text>
  <text start="446.96" dur="4.079">we do receive these blessings we the</text>
  <text start="449.03" dur="5.73">first thing on our heart is to give back</text>
  <text start="451.039" dur="6.151">to you to bless him back and that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.76" dur="3.719">a very important principle it&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="457.19" dur="3.06">the principal first fruits you know</text>
  <text start="458.479" dur="3.331">we&amp;#39;re coming up on the feast of first</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="3.21">fruits which starts tonight Saturday</text>
  <text start="461.81" dur="3.63">night it&amp;#39;s always the day after the</text>
  <text start="463.46" dur="3.019">Shabbat within the seven days of</text>
  <text start="465.44" dur="3.33">unleavened bread so that would be</text>
  <text start="466.479" dur="3.94">starting tonight Saturday night going to</text>
  <text start="468.77" dur="4.86">tomorrow night throughout the day of</text>
  <text start="470.419" dur="5.071">April the 24th and firstfruits of course</text>
  <text start="473.63" dur="3.57">is when Yahshua ascended to the Father</text>
  <text start="475.49" dur="5.1">he was the first fruit from among the</text>
  <text start="477.2" dur="5.339">dead heroes just before Shabbat ended on</text>
  <text start="480.59" dur="4.259">Resurrection Sabbath but it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="482.539" dur="4.141">discovered that he&amp;#39;d risen until that</text>
  <text start="484.849" dur="3.211">feast of firstfruits but the whole</text>
  <text start="486.68" dur="3.69">principle of the feast of firstfruits is</text>
  <text start="488.06" dur="3.75">you give the first the Israelites were</text>
  <text start="490.37" dur="3.51">commanded to bring of the very first</text>
  <text start="491.81" dur="3.15">harvest which is the barley that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="493.88" dur="3.18">very first harvest in Israel they</text>
  <text start="494.96" dur="4.5">recommended to then bring of that their</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="5.039">first shock their first shave their wave</text>
  <text start="499.46" dur="3.81">offering to the high priest for Passover</text>
  <text start="502.099" dur="2.341">week so that the high priests could</text>
  <text start="503.27" dur="3.06">waive it during the feast of first</text>
  <text start="504.44" dur="3.72">fruits and that principle is about</text>
  <text start="506.33" dur="5.91">giving the first of our increase to</text>
  <text start="508.16" dur="5.46">yacht and putting him first and another</text>
  <text start="512.24" dur="3.39">principle that goes along with that is</text>
  <text start="513.62" dur="4.229">as y&amp;#39;all blesses you or blesses your</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="3.539">quote-unquote field you don&amp;#39;t glean the</text>
  <text start="517.849" dur="2.581">corners of that field but you leave it</text>
  <text start="519.169" dur="3.391">for the poor on the widow and the orphan</text>
  <text start="520.43" dur="3.81">and so it&amp;#39;s very important that when we</text>
  <text start="522.56" dur="4.11">do get that increase in that blessings</text>
  <text start="524.24" dur="4.039">we always take that first portion and</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="4.43">for most of us because the site</text>
  <text start="528.279" dur="4.831">it would be income so if I get paid I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="531.1" dur="3.719">take that first portion that ten percent</text>
  <text start="533.11" dur="3.12">and I&amp;#39;ll give it to the widow the poor</text>

  <text start="540.009" dur="5.37">principle and when he does that excuse</text>
  <text start="543.22" dur="4.589">me when you do that what he will do is</text>
  <text start="545.379" dur="4.471">he will make sure that when you give him</text>
  <text start="547.809" dur="4.741">the first portion he will make sure that</text>
  <text start="549.85" dur="5.159">every penny you spend thereafter will be</text>
  <text start="552.55" dur="4.74">exactly according to his will and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="555.009" dur="4.5">beautiful amazing thing how he involves</text>
  <text start="557.29" dur="4.739">himself in your monetary life and in</text>
  <text start="559.509" dur="4.651">every little detail of your life it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.029" dur="6.66">just a beautiful beautiful beautiful</text>
  <text start="564.16" dur="6.989">thing and so wonderful the other thing</text>
  <text start="568.689" dur="4.02">we sort of were talking about last night</text>
  <text start="571.149" dur="3.391">there&amp;#39;s a lot of joy laughter and</text>
  <text start="572.709" dur="5.341">discussion but we were also talking</text>
  <text start="574.54" dur="5.58">about how Donald Trump who&amp;#39;s running for</text>
  <text start="578.05" dur="5.07">president the front-runner Republican is</text>
  <text start="580.12" dur="5.909">has this anointing of King Cyrus you</text>
  <text start="583.12" dur="5.459">know King Cyrus was a wrecking ball for</text>
  <text start="586.029" dur="4.5">yacht he allowed the Jews not only to</text>
  <text start="588.579" dur="3.961">return and leave captivity which I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="590.529" dur="4.11">sure disrupted the Society of persia at</text>
  <text start="592.54" dur="5.19">the time but then he commanded the Jews</text>
  <text start="594.639" dur="5.25">to build a wall to build to rebuild that</text>
  <text start="597.73" dur="4.02">temple to rebuild the city of Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="599.889" dur="3.361">or at least the temple at that point the</text>
  <text start="601.75" dur="3.75">city of Jerusalem wouldn&amp;#39;t come till</text>
  <text start="603.25" dur="3.99">later but issued a decree to build that</text>
  <text start="605.5" dur="3.839">wall to build that temple and so of</text>
  <text start="607.24" dur="4.199">course Trump also is wanting to build a</text>
  <text start="609.339" dur="4.11">wall but it&amp;#39;s has deeper implications</text>
  <text start="611.439" dur="4.02">than that it&amp;#39;s building the wall of</text>
  <text start="613.449" dur="4.95">Torah building the walls of right and</text>
  <text start="615.459" dur="5.88">wrong and boundaries you can&amp;#39;t have true</text>
  <text start="618.399" dur="6.18">freedom unless you follow the boundaries</text>
  <text start="621.339" dur="5.071">of morality and even more specifically</text>
  <text start="624.579" dur="4.38">you really can&amp;#39;t find true liberty and</text>
  <text start="626.41" dur="4.349">freedom until you die to yourself give</text>
  <text start="628.959" dur="3.211">yourself up to Yahshua get washed his</text>
  <text start="630.759" dur="3.481">blood fill the spirit and start walking</text>
  <text start="632.17" dur="4.229">in his Torah the commandments he laid</text>
  <text start="634.24" dur="4.62">down the boundaries he laid down in his</text>
  <text start="636.399" dur="4.141">word for us to follow and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="638.86" dur="3.99">true Liberty comes out so there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="640.54" dur="5.13">more going on behind the scenes than</text>
  <text start="642.85" dur="4.56">just Trump becoming president which I</text>
  <text start="645.67" dur="3.509">believe he will be but he is anointed</text>
  <text start="647.41" dur="3.479">with that anointing and he&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="649.179" dur="3.15">against a religious establishment I mean</text>
  <text start="650.889" dur="3.3">look how he tangled with the Pope and</text>
  <text start="652.329" dur="3.99">look how he&amp;#39;s table tangled with so many</text>
  <text start="654.189" dur="4.2">of the establishments and so many you</text>
  <text start="656.319" dur="3.45">know self-righteous crews or supporters</text>
  <text start="658.389" dur="4.44">are so offended by a min hee</text>
  <text start="659.769" dur="6.451">he&amp;#39;s he has this anointing to offend the</text>
  <text start="662.829" dur="5.79">religious establishments of the day and</text>
  <text start="666.22" dur="4.919">that&amp;#39;s very similar we watched this</text>
  <text start="668.619" dur="3.87">video where this one gentleman pointed</text>
  <text start="671.139" dur="4.14">out that that&amp;#39;s very similar to John</text>
  <text start="672.489" dur="6">Knox John Knox was a Scottish Protestant</text>
  <text start="675.279" dur="5.52">who was a reformer used by yacht to</text>
  <text start="678.489" dur="4.5">basically bring Scotland out from under</text>
  <text start="680.799" dur="6.45">the thumb of Mary Queen of Scots and</text>
  <text start="682.989" dur="7.171">Catholicism as a whole and in the same</text>
  <text start="687.249" dur="4.8">way you know Trump is a stew has a</text>
  <text start="690.16" dur="3.899">Scottish Protestant heritage his mother</text>
  <text start="692.049" dur="6.27">was a very strong Christian gave him his</text>
  <text start="694.059" dur="6.541">Bible was one who urged him to to go to</text>
  <text start="698.319" dur="3.901">this he was going to a church that you</text>
  <text start="700.6" dur="3.12">know had a lot of positive motivational</text>
  <text start="702.22" dur="3.599">speaking so I don&amp;#39;t know how much Torah</text>
  <text start="703.72" dur="3.839">or scripture he heard but he did have</text>
  <text start="705.819" dur="3.151">that heritage and I do believe there is</text>
  <text start="707.559" dur="4.111">a special anointing just like what was</text>
  <text start="708.97" dur="4.079">on John Knox the reformer too anyway</text>
  <text start="711.67" dur="2.699">this guy makes a really good point that</text>
  <text start="713.049" dur="3.181">video and I&amp;#39;m going to try to find it i</text>
  <text start="714.369" dur="3.57">asked the brother that shared it with me</text>

  <text start="724.959" dur="4.651">couple videos ago we&amp;#39;re now in the the</text>
  <text start="726.97" dur="4.859">season of deliverance of salvation of</text>
