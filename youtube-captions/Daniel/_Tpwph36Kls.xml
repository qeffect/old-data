  <text start="282.29" dur="6.28">that susan wrote to me and this was a</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="4.32">few days ago she said daniel i believe</text>
  <text start="288.57" dur="4.38">for a long time that there&amp;#39;s an evil</text>
  <text start="290.1" dur="5.1">quote spirit of politeness that</text>
  <text start="292.95" dur="4.29">masquerades as kindness kindness being</text>
  <text start="295.2" dur="3.66">an aspect of love the spirit of</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="3.12">politeness makes people weak and</text>
  <text start="298.86" dur="3.75">prevents them from calling out</text>
  <text start="300.36" dur="3.99">wrongdoing I believe that this spirit</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="4.11">got a toehold in this country during the</text>
  <text start="304.35" dur="4.56">1960s when there was a lot of social</text>
  <text start="306.72" dur="4.53">upheaval and people learned to look the</text>
  <text start="308.91" dur="3.93">other way people became fearful of</text>
  <text start="311.25" dur="3.6">retribution when they came to believe</text>
  <text start="312.84" dur="4.74">they were of the minority opinion I</text>
  <text start="314.85" dur="4.35">believe this quote spirit of politeness</text>
  <text start="317.58" dur="3.93">needs to be identified for what it is</text>
  <text start="319.2" dur="4.38">and heartily rebuked thanks for</text>
  <text start="321.51" dur="3.09">listening god bless Susan and I really</text>
  <text start="323.58" dur="3.45">liked what she wrote I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.6" dur="5.88">really true because you know I&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="327.03" dur="6.51">lot of sort of blowback from me exposing</text>
  <text start="330.48" dur="5.58">certain individuals that are not exactly</text>
  <text start="333.54" dur="3.63">who they say they are and and and people</text>
  <text start="336.06" dur="3.42">seem to get offended because they think</text>
  <text start="337.17" dur="3.99">I need to be you know having unity just</text>
  <text start="339.48" dur="3.54">for the sake of unity or being polite</text>
  <text start="341.16" dur="4.44">not calling out the wickedness and the</text>
  <text start="343.02" dur="3.78">sin and and so I thought that was really</text>
  <text start="345.6" dur="2.49">really good so this is something that</text>
  <text start="346.8" dur="2.339">you could all be praying for we can be</text>
  <text start="348.09" dur="3.479">praying against that</text>
  <text start="349.139" dur="4.08">spirit of politeness that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="351.569" dur="6">counterfeit of the fruit of the Holy</text>
  <text start="353.219" dur="6.331">Spirit kindness is uh it&amp;#39;s torn down and</text>
  <text start="357.569" dur="3.541">people really rise up and stand up and</text>
  <text start="359.55" dur="3.69">rebuke evil when it needs to be done</text>
  <text start="361.11" dur="2.66">that&amp;#39;s what Ephesians 5:11 is all about</text>
  <text start="363.24" dur="2.609">right</text>
  <text start="363.77" dur="3.669">exposing and reproving the unfruitful</text>
