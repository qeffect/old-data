  <text start="0.829" dur="6.611">shabbat shalom this is Daniel John Lee</text>
  <text start="4.08" dur="8.07">with Torah restoration ministries it is</text>
  <text start="7.44" dur="8.159">June the 17th 2017 is the Shabbat and is</text>
  <text start="12.15" dur="5.91">this is the 7/7 part of my 17 part</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="6.241">series reconciling the teachings of</text>
  <text start="18.06" dur="7.17">Messiah with Apostle Paul this is part</text>
  <text start="21.84" dur="6.48">seven on the book of Galatians against</text>
  <text start="25.23" dur="4.59">the Torah and of course it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="28.32" dur="3.51">very appropriate I have actually James</text>
  <text start="29.82" dur="4.86">block is playing live from Israel right</text>
  <text start="31.83" dur="4.61">now and he just he just spoke out about</text>
  <text start="34.68" dur="4.83">how the false shepherds over centuries</text>
  <text start="36.44" dur="6.61">have confused us with the traditions of</text>
  <text start="39.51" dur="5.43">men and my ears perked up when he said</text>
  <text start="43.05" dur="4.65">that because that is what Galatians is</text>
  <text start="44.94" dur="6.509">about Galatians is about the traditions</text>
  <text start="47.7" dur="5.46">of men so many Christians have tried to</text>
  <text start="51.449" dur="3.901">use this book to say we don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="53.16" dur="4.71">keep Torah we don&amp;#39;t need to obey the</text>
  <text start="55.35" dur="5.22">Torah but that is not what Galatians is</text>
  <text start="57.87" dur="4.739">about it is about the traditions of men</text>
  <text start="60.57" dur="4.08">now before we get into galatians i just</text>
  <text start="62.609" dur="3.87">want to remind everyone of one of the</text>
  <text start="64.65" dur="4.74">three main principles that was covered</text>
  <text start="66.479" dur="4.351">in part one of this series and one of</text>
  <text start="69.39" dur="3.63">those three main principles in fact i</text>
  <text start="70.83" dur="5.94">think it was the first one that I put up</text>
  <text start="73.02" dur="7.59">there is from Matthew 5 starting in</text>
  <text start="76.77" dur="6.75">verse 17 think not this is Yahshua the</text>
  <text start="80.61" dur="5.579">Messiah talking think not that I am come</text>
  <text start="83.52" dur="6.029">to destroy the Torah for the prophets I</text>
  <text start="86.189" dur="6.841">come not to destroy but to fulfill to</text>
  <text start="89.549" dur="6">fill up to revive for verily saying to</text>
  <text start="93.03" dur="4.92">you until the heavens in earth pass not</text>
  <text start="95.549" dur="4.68">one jot or one tittle shall in no wise</text>
  <text start="97.95" dur="4.919">pass from the torrid till everything is</text>
  <text start="100.229" dur="4.68">accomplished whosoever therefore shall</text>
  <text start="102.869" dur="4.801">break one of these least Commandments</text>
  <text start="104.909" dur="4.081">and shall teach men so he shall be</text>
  <text start="107.67" dur="3.75">called the least in the kingdom of</text>
  <text start="108.99" dur="4.739">heaven but whosoever shall do and teach</text>
  <text start="111.42" dur="4.019">them the same shall be called great in</text>
  <text start="113.729" dur="4.261">the kingdom of heaven</text>
  <text start="115.439" dur="6.241">so Yahshua very clearly says right here</text>
  <text start="117.99" dur="5.82">if you are telling people to to not obey</text>
  <text start="121.68" dur="4.17">even the smallest jot or tittle of Torah</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="2.55">you&amp;#39;re gonna be looked at as least in</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="3.57">his kingdom</text>
  <text start="126.36" dur="4.47">so Galatians has been used to say look</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="4.39">we don&amp;#39;t have to keep all these jots and</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="4.269">tittles of Torah well that obviously if</text>
  <text start="133.81" dur="2.82">that&amp;#39;s really what Paul was saying it</text>
  <text start="135.099" dur="3.991">would come completely against what</text>
  <text start="136.63" dur="3.39">Messiah taught in Matthew five and of</text>
  <text start="139.09" dur="3.09">course we&amp;#39;re going to show that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="140.02" dur="4.41">not what Paul was saying at all he is</text>
  <text start="142.18" dur="3.66">teaching number one primarily against</text>
  <text start="144.43" dur="3.87">the traditions of men and then the other</text>
  <text start="145.84" dur="4.59">issue he&amp;#39;s dealing with is that the</text>
  <text start="148.3" dur="5.1">Torah obedience to the actual Torah</text>
  <text start="150.43" dur="4.889">never justifies you and that&amp;#39;s true it</text>
  <text start="153.4" dur="5.64">never it was never designed to justify</text>
  <text start="155.319" dur="7.051">anyone it was always an act of obedience</text>
  <text start="159.04" dur="5.09">after you fall in love with yah after</text>
  <text start="162.37" dur="5.76">you fall in love with the Messiah</text>
  <text start="164.13" dur="6.34">remember Abraham he believed ano that</text>
  <text start="168.13" dur="4.169">was accounted to him righteousness right</text>
  <text start="170.47" dur="5.4">he believed ano before he was ever</text>
  <text start="172.299" dur="6.871">circumcised but when yah then commanded</text>
  <text start="175.87" dur="5.839">him to get circumcised he did so right</text>
  <text start="179.17" dur="5.49">so it didn&amp;#39;t justify him it was an</text>
  <text start="181.709" dur="4.871">instruction to be done after one has</text>
  <text start="184.66" dur="4.049">been washed in the blood filled with the</text>
  <text start="186.58" dur="3.93">spirit and loves yah with all the heart</text>
  <text start="188.709" dur="3.181">soul mind and strength so those are the</text>
  <text start="190.51" dur="3.27">two issues were going to talk about and</text>
  <text start="191.89" dur="4.969">that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s what Galatians is all</text>
  <text start="193.78" dur="6.09">about so starting in Galatians chapter 1</text>
  <text start="196.859" dur="4.72">Paul is making this introduction in the</text>
  <text start="199.87" dur="2.64">first few verses talking about this very</text>
  <text start="201.579" dur="3.121">accursed</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="3.96">gospel and he even says anyone who</text>
  <text start="204.7" dur="4.23">teaches this gospel let him be accursed</text>
  <text start="206.47" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s a perversion of the true gospel and</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="6.23">what is this perversion if we find it</text>
  <text start="211.45" dur="7.11">highlighted first in verse 14 Galatians</text>
  <text start="215.16" dur="7.329">1:14 because Paul was talking about</text>
  <text start="218.56" dur="6.239">before he was converted and he says as</text>
  <text start="222.489" dur="4.351">he was persecuting the assemblies of yah</text>
  <text start="224.799" dur="4.381">he said any profited in the Jews</text>
  <text start="226.84" dur="4.049">religion above many of my equals in mine</text>
  <text start="229.18" dur="5.33">own nation being more exceedingly</text>
  <text start="230.889" dur="6.061">zealous of the traditions of my father&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="234.51" dur="4">the traditions of my father&amp;#39;s that is</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="3.2">the thesis statement for all of</text>
  <text start="238.51" dur="4.92">Galatians the traditions of my father&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="4.899">so what are these traditions well if you</text>
  <text start="243.43" dur="3.3">go to the Gospels you&amp;#39;ll find a lot of</text>
  <text start="245.049" dur="4.171">these traditions that Yahshua rails</text>
  <text start="246.73" dur="6.539">against these traditions that you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="249.22" dur="6.45">carry a mat on the Sabbath that you can</text>
  <text start="253.269" dur="4.5">pay a piece of money at the temple</text>
  <text start="255.67" dur="3.869">called Corbin and you can then not have</text>
  <text start="257.769" dur="3.81">to honor your father and mother these</text>
  <text start="259.539" dur="6.221">traditions of the fathers that literally</text>
  <text start="261.579" dur="6.251">opposed the very written Torah of Moshe</text>
  <text start="265.76" dur="4.8">now traditions in and of themselves are</text>
  <text start="267.83" dur="5.1">not wrong but when traditions oppose the</text>
  <text start="270.56" dur="5.01">word of yah whether they be traditions</text>
  <text start="272.93" dur="4.68">in first century Judaism or whether they</text>
  <text start="275.57" dur="4.26">be traditions in 21st century</text>
  <text start="277.61" dur="4.71">Christianity when they oppose the word</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="4.77">of yah those traditions are evil it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="5.7">perversion of the gospel and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="284.6" dur="5.07">Paul that&amp;#39;s what many of the Pharisees</text>
  <text start="288.02" dur="4.2">and Sadducees were following not the</text>
  <text start="289.67" dur="4.92">actual written Torah but they were</text>
  <text start="292.22" dur="5.4">actually following the traditions of men</text>
  <text start="294.59" dur="5.07">this is why Paul although he thought he</text>
  <text start="297.62" dur="5.4">was zealous for the Torah was committing</text>
  <text start="299.66" dur="5.73">murder was sanctioning murder okay</text>
  <text start="303.02" dur="3.96">he was sanctioning murder of people who</text>
  <text start="305.39" dur="3.33">are following in the way this was before</text>
  <text start="306.98" dur="3.3">he&amp;#39;s converted because he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="308.72" dur="3.87">understand the very heart of Torah which</text>
  <text start="310.28" dur="4.44">is what is it love your neighbor love</text>
  <text start="312.59" dur="4.11">your neighbor and love yeah so whenever</text>
  <text start="314.72" dur="4.32">you get lost in the traditions of men as</text>
  <text start="316.7" dur="5.88">they oppose the written word of yah it</text>
  <text start="319.04" dur="6.51">will completely get your entire focus</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="4.79">off where it needs to be so as the</text>
  <text start="325.55" dur="5.22">traditions of men that he&amp;#39;s dealing with</text>
  <text start="327.37" dur="7.03">now how do we know that we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="330.77" dur="7.86">about the traditions of men so if we go</text>
  <text start="334.4" dur="7.68">into Galatians chapter 2 we&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="338.63" dur="5.46">start in verse verse 1 then 14 years</text>
  <text start="342.08" dur="3.93">after I went up again to Jerusalem with</text>
  <text start="344.09" dur="3.69">Barnabas and took Titus with me also</text>
  <text start="346.01" dur="4.29">and I went up by revelation and</text>
  <text start="347.78" dur="4.35">communicated unto them that gospel which</text>
  <text start="350.3" dur="3.36">I preached among the Gentiles but</text>
  <text start="352.13" dur="3.84">privately to them which were of</text>
  <text start="353.66" dur="5.31">reputation lest by any means I should</text>
  <text start="355.97" dur="5.49">run or had run in vain but neither Titus</text>
  <text start="358.97" dur="5.46">who was with me being a greek was</text>
  <text start="361.46" dur="4.26">compelled to be circumcised and that</text>
  <text start="364.43" dur="3.99">because of false brethren unawares</text>
  <text start="365.72" dur="4.59">brought in who came in privily to spy</text>
  <text start="368.42" dur="4.41">out liberty which we have in Messiah</text>
  <text start="370.31" dur="6.78">Yahshua that they might bring us into</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="6.3">bondage okay so that word compelled if</text>
  <text start="377.09" dur="6.6">you look up that word in in the Greek it</text>
  <text start="379.13" dur="7.05">literally means to threaten by force now</text>
  <text start="383.69" dur="4.5">nowhere in the Torah are you to be</text>
  <text start="386.18" dur="5.37">threatened by force to get circumcised</text>
  <text start="388.19" dur="5.19">nowhere so we&amp;#39;re not actually talking</text>
  <text start="391.55" dur="3.72">about the circumcision that was given to</text>
  <text start="393.38" dur="3.72">Abraham that you&amp;#39;re supposed to do to</text>
  <text start="395.27" dur="2.799">your male son on the eighth day of his</text>
  <text start="397.1" dur="3.56">life</text>
  <text start="398.069" dur="4.271">we&amp;#39;re not talking about the circumcision</text>
  <text start="400.66" dur="5.61">that it&amp;#39;s supposed to be done in order</text>
  <text start="402.34" dur="5.79">for you to partake of Passover in fact</text>
  <text start="406.27" dur="4.44">you could just replace circumcision with</text>
  <text start="408.13" dur="4.349">water baptism are you ever supposed to</text>
  <text start="410.71" dur="4.41">force unto thread anyone to be baptized</text>
  <text start="412.479" dur="4.53">by water of course not no that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="415.12" dur="4.62">something that you automatically want to</text>
  <text start="417.009" dur="5.011">do because you have been converted</text>
  <text start="419.74" dur="4.23">you&amp;#39;ve been washed clean of your sins so</text>
  <text start="422.02" dur="3.959">you want to get baptized in water in the</text>
  <text start="423.97" dur="4.74">same way you&amp;#39;ll have an inward desire to</text>
  <text start="425.979" dur="4.021">want to be circumcised the circumcision</text>
  <text start="428.71" dur="3.17">of Abraham because these are</text>
  <text start="430" dur="4.41">Commandments that y&amp;#39;all&amp;#39;s given us to do</text>
  <text start="431.88" dur="4.78">so Paul is again referring to this</text>
  <text start="434.41" dur="5.61">circumcision of Moses which we talked</text>
  <text start="436.66" dur="6.18">about earlier in part 2 that&amp;#39;s covered</text>
  <text start="440.02" dur="5.369">in acts 15 which is basically this whole</text>
  <text start="442.84" dur="4.02">all these it&amp;#39;s the traditions of the</text>
  <text start="445.389" dur="3.87">fathers what he&amp;#39;s talking about in verse</text>
  <text start="446.86" dur="4.11">14 the circumcision that is talked about</text>
  <text start="449.259" dur="4.261">here is the traditions of the father&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.97" dur="5.069">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s this complex ritual that you</text>
  <text start="453.52" dur="4.29">have to enter into to follow all these</text>
  <text start="456.039" dur="3.06">vain traditions that oppose the Torah</text>
  <text start="457.81" dur="2.849">that is what&amp;#39;s being discussed here</text>
  <text start="459.099" dur="3.481">we&amp;#39;re not actually talking about the</text>
  <text start="460.659" dur="4.141">removal of the foreskin and and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.58" dur="5.22">very easily provable because if you go</text>
  <text start="464.8" dur="7.29">to Acts chapter 16 you&amp;#39;ll find what Paul</text>
  <text start="467.8" dur="6.239">did to Timothy in verse 3 it says</text>
  <text start="472.09" dur="4.5">Timothy would Paul have to go forth with</text>
  <text start="474.039" dur="4.68">him and so Paul took and circumcised</text>
  <text start="476.59" dur="4.47">Timothy because the Jews which were in</text>
  <text start="478.719" dur="3.391">those quarters for they knew all that</text>
  <text start="481.06" dur="3.78">his father was a Greek</text>
  <text start="482.11" dur="4.859">so Timothy was a was a half Gentile here</text>
  <text start="484.84" dur="3.24">and Paul had him circumcised but wait a</text>
  <text start="486.969" dur="2.491">minute thought you said Paul said that</text>
  <text start="488.08" dur="2.399">you don&amp;#39;t have to be circumcised we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="489.46" dur="3.42">talking about two different issues here</text>
  <text start="490.479" dur="3.87">one we&amp;#39;re talking about the actual</text>
  <text start="492.88" dur="2.55">circumcision that you&amp;#39;re supposed to do</text>
  <text start="494.349" dur="2.88">and that&amp;#39;s why Paul had Timothy</text>
  <text start="495.43" dur="4.229">circumcise this one that we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="497.229" dur="5.011">about with Titus is this acts 15</text>
  <text start="499.659" dur="4.921">traditions of the fathers so everything</text>
  <text start="502.24" dur="5.66">can be understood by the context by the</text>
  <text start="504.58" dur="6.24">context of how it&amp;#39;s being talked about</text>
  <text start="507.9" dur="5.319">the actual circumcision given to Abraham</text>
  <text start="510.82" dur="4.74">which is again just an outward sign of</text>
  <text start="513.219" dur="4.711">what has an inward change just like</text>
  <text start="515.56" dur="4.95">water baptism is an outward sign of an</text>
  <text start="517.93" dur="4.56">inward change okay these things don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="520.51" dur="3.84">bring you into bondage they don&amp;#39;t bring</text>
  <text start="522.49" dur="4.92">you into bondage but trying to follow</text>
  <text start="524.35" dur="4.77">traditions of men that opposed the Torah</text>
  <text start="527.41" dur="4.669">oh yeah that absolutely brings you into</text>
  <text start="529.12" dur="2.959">bondage mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="532.54" dur="4.11">and that&amp;#39;s why these these Pharisees</text>
  <text start="534.97" dur="4.02">were trying to bring these believing</text>
  <text start="536.65" dur="5.31">these new believers in Galatia into this</text>
  <text start="538.99" dur="3.48">to further their own glory for their own</text>
  <text start="541.96" dur="2.9">glory</text>
  <text start="542.47" dur="4.5">follow the these own man-made traditions</text>
  <text start="544.86" dur="4.69">and that&amp;#39;s what Paul contains to talk</text>
  <text start="546.97" dur="4.5">about throughout chapter 2 now when we</text>
  <text start="549.55" dur="4.17">get to verse 11 of chapter 2 we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="551.47" dur="4.02">talk about an actual tradition of the</text>
  <text start="553.72" dur="5.1">father that Peter started slipping into</text>
  <text start="555.49" dur="6.06">and Paul had to rebuke him so starting</text>
  <text start="558.82" dur="4.44">in verse 11 but when Peter was come to</text>
  <text start="561.55" dur="4.77">Antioch I withstood him to the face</text>
  <text start="563.26" dur="6.12">because he was to be blamed for before</text>
  <text start="566.32" dur="4.47">that certain came from James he did eat</text>
  <text start="569.38" dur="3.35">with the Gentiles but when they were</text>
  <text start="570.79" dur="4.11">come he was drew and separated himself</text>
  <text start="572.73" dur="4.57">fearing them which were of the</text>
  <text start="574.9" dur="4.14">circumcision but the other Jews</text>
  <text start="577.3" dur="3.81">dissembled likewise with him and so much</text>
  <text start="579.04" dur="5.19">that Barnabas also was carried away with</text>
  <text start="581.11" dur="4.89">their dissimulation but when I saw that</text>
  <text start="584.23" dur="4.05">they walked not uprightly according to</text>
  <text start="586" dur="5.07">the truth of the gospel I said unto</text>
  <text start="588.28" dur="5.19">Peter before them all if thou being a</text>
  <text start="591.07" dur="4.62">jew live us after the manner of gentiles</text>
  <text start="593.47" dur="5.87">and not as do the jews why compel us</text>
  <text start="595.69" dur="6.51">thou the gentiles to live as do the jews</text>
  <text start="599.34" dur="4.51">you see there is nothing in Torah that</text>
  <text start="602.2" dur="3.84">says we are not allowed to eat with the</text>
  <text start="603.85" dur="3.72">Gentiles in fact these are Gentile</text>
  <text start="606.04" dur="3.18">believers are new believers who are</text>
  <text start="607.57" dur="5.1">being grafted in the Commonwealth of</text>
  <text start="609.22" dur="6.06">Israel who want to walk in covenant with</text>
  <text start="612.67" dur="4.17">yah if anything we need to eat with</text>
  <text start="615.28" dur="3.45">these people we need to felt it with</text>
  <text start="616.84" dur="4.92">these people to teach them the actual</text>
  <text start="618.73" dur="4.68">written Torah that&amp;#39;s the whole point but</text>
  <text start="621.76" dur="3.78">there was a tradition of men that was</text>
  <text start="623.41" dur="4.26">embedded in 1st century Judaism</text>
  <text start="625.54" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;re told Jews never to eat with</text>
  <text start="627.67" dur="4.26">Gentiles well that is just not in Torah</text>
  <text start="630.46" dur="3.3">anywhere so this was a tradition of the</text>
  <text start="631.93" dur="3.81">father that Peter was starting to fall</text>
  <text start="633.76" dur="3.48">into because he was getting pressured by</text>
  <text start="635.74" dur="3.9">these other Pharisees that were coming</text>
  <text start="637.24" dur="4.2">to pray on the Galatian believers and</text>
  <text start="639.64" dur="4.32">Paul rebuked him for it powder</text>
  <text start="641.44" dur="4.44">beautifully so why are you trying to get</text>
  <text start="643.96" dur="4.95">these Gentiles to now live under these</text>
  <text start="645.88" dur="4.29">traditions of men like these Jews are</text>
  <text start="648.91" dur="3.57">doing when you&amp;#39;re not even doing that</text>
  <text start="650.17" dur="4.89">because Peter had cast off those</text>
  <text start="652.48" dur="4.2">traditions of men and returned to the</text>
  <text start="655.06" dur="3">pure Torah out of a love for Messiah</text>
  <text start="656.68" dur="5.26">because that&amp;#39;s what Yahshua taught him</text>
  <text start="658.06" dur="6.01">and continued emphasize like in Acts</text>
  <text start="661.94" dur="3.54">when he gave him that dream be sure that</text>
  <text start="664.07" dur="5.67">Gentiles can be filled with the spirit</text>
  <text start="665.48" dur="6.51">which is exactly what Torah teaches so</text>
  <text start="669.74" dur="5">again this is an example very clearly</text>
  <text start="671.99" dur="7.41">here that Paul is coming against the</text>
  <text start="674.74" dur="8.23">traditions of men so skipping ahead to</text>
  <text start="679.4" dur="6">Galatians three o foolish Galatians who</text>
  <text start="682.97" dur="4.74">is bewitched you that you should not</text>
  <text start="685.4" dur="4.44">obey the truth before whose eyes</text>
  <text start="687.71" dur="4.8">Yahshua the Messiah has evidently been</text>
  <text start="689.84" dur="4.44">set forth crucified among you this only</text>
  <text start="692.51" dur="4.32">would I learn of you received you the</text>
  <text start="694.28" dur="7.77">spirit by the works of the law or by the</text>
  <text start="696.83" dur="8.28">hearing of faith by the works the law or</text>
  <text start="702.05" dur="4.29">the hearing a faith now again there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="705.11" dur="4.02">two things that have to be considered</text>
  <text start="706.34" dur="6.84">when Paul&amp;#39;s asking this question first</text>
  <text start="709.13" dur="6.51">of all you are converted by the hearing</text>
  <text start="713.18" dur="6.48">of faith by faith by placing your trust</text>
  <text start="715.64" dur="5.82">in Yahshua the Messiah and then because</text>
  <text start="719.66" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;ve put your trust in him now you</text>
  <text start="721.46" dur="4.49">want to do the works of the Torah the</text>
  <text start="724.22" dur="4.35">work the commandments that are given you</text>
  <text start="725.95" dur="3.21">so that&amp;#39;s how you that&amp;#39;s how it should</text>
  <text start="728.57" dur="3.75">operate</text>
  <text start="729.16" dur="5.17">so these Pharisees are trying to to put</text>
  <text start="732.32" dur="4.05">the cart before the horse and say no no</text>
  <text start="734.33" dur="3.93">the works of the law come first but then</text>
  <text start="736.37" dur="4.29">the other thing that we have to pay</text>
  <text start="738.26" dur="4.59">attention to is that word law it all it</text>
  <text start="740.66" dur="4.56">means in the Greek is Nomos and that</text>
  <text start="742.85" dur="6.48">word normals can refer to any system or</text>
  <text start="745.22" dur="5.88">body of regulations or rules so it could</text>
  <text start="749.33" dur="5.16">be referring to the Torah or it could be</text>
  <text start="751.1" dur="4.83">referring to what the Jews had an idea</text>
  <text start="754.49" dur="3.18">of the tour of in the first century was</text>
  <text start="755.93" dur="3.69">with a mixture of the actual</text>
  <text start="757.67" dur="4.47">Commandments along with these traditions</text>
  <text start="759.62" dur="4.71">of the fathers that violated the Torah</text>
  <text start="762.14" dur="3.48">okay so these are the two things you</text>
  <text start="764.33" dur="5.85">have to keep in mind as you&amp;#39;re reading</text>
  <text start="765.62" dur="6.51">this scripture are you so foolish having</text>
  <text start="770.18" dur="4.44">begun in the spirit are you now made</text>
  <text start="772.13" dur="3.84">perfect by the flesh see when you&amp;#39;ve try</text>
  <text start="774.62" dur="3.78">to follow these traditions of the</text>
  <text start="775.97" dur="4.47">fathers that violate the Torah you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="778.4" dur="4.2">walking in the flesh you&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="780.44" dur="6.06">to puff yourself up that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="782.6" dur="6">about to pump yourself up have you</text>
  <text start="786.5" dur="2.91">suffered so many things in vain if it be</text>
  <text start="788.6" dur="3.33">yet in vain</text>
  <text start="789.41" dur="5.19">he therefore that ministers to you the</text>
  <text start="791.93" dur="4.469">spirit and works miracles among you does</text>
  <text start="794.6" dur="4.14">he do it by the works of the law or by</text>
  <text start="796.399" dur="4.17">the hearing of faith and then here he</text>
  <text start="798.74" dur="3.539">goes and Abraham even as abraham</text>
  <text start="800.569" dur="3.531">believed God and it was accounted to him</text>
  <text start="802.279" dur="4.471">for righteousness</text>
  <text start="804.1" dur="4.419">know ye therefore that they which are of</text>
  <text start="806.75" dur="2.49">faith the same are the children of</text>
  <text start="808.519" dur="3.18">Abraham</text>
  <text start="809.24" dur="4.769">so did Abraham throw away the Torah no</text>
  <text start="811.699" dur="6.601">of course not Abraham circumcised</text>
  <text start="814.009" dur="7.2">himself when he was 99 years of age but</text>
  <text start="818.3" dur="6.029">he wasn&amp;#39;t justified by that he was</text>
  <text start="821.209" dur="6.511">justified by faith and that&amp;#39;s the point</text>
  <text start="824.329" dur="5.581">that Paul was trying to make here in</text>
  <text start="827.72" dur="4.469">fact he even says it very clearly in</text>
  <text start="829.91" dur="4.38">verse 11 when it says but that no man is</text>
  <text start="832.189" dur="4.231">justified by the law on the side of yad</text>
  <text start="834.29" dur="2.669">as evident for the just shall live by</text>
  <text start="836.42" dur="3.3">faith</text>
  <text start="836.959" dur="4.86">it is trusting in him and is living in</text>
  <text start="839.72" dur="3.929">accordance with his precepts it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="841.819" dur="4.411">fully surrendering to him that&amp;#39;s how you</text>
  <text start="843.649" dur="4.021">live and by doing so then you start</text>
  <text start="846.23" dur="4.37">obeying the commandments in the Torah</text>
  <text start="847.67" dur="2.93">that&amp;#39;s how it works</text>
  <text start="850.72" dur="6.309">but again first century Jews Judaism</text>
  <text start="853.43" dur="5.459">tries to reverse the process tries to</text>
  <text start="857.029" dur="4.651">say no no you got to go through these</text>
  <text start="858.889" dur="4.921">man-made tradition complex rituals and</text>
  <text start="861.68" dur="4.589">that&amp;#39;s what actually saves you and it</text>
  <text start="863.81" dur="4.829">doesn&amp;#39;t it would be like if a modern</text>
  <text start="866.269" dur="5.911">Christian said if you get dunked in h2o</text>
  <text start="868.639" dur="5.461">that will save you if you go to church</text>
  <text start="872.18" dur="3.57">on Sunday that worth that will save you</text>
  <text start="874.1" dur="4.2">well that&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="875.75" dur="4.589">those things don&amp;#39;t save you it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="878.3" dur="3.899">only Yahshua seated on the heart of the</text>
  <text start="880.339" dur="6.471">the heart of your the throne of your</text>
  <text start="882.199" dur="11.481">heart that saves you so Paul makes that</text>
  <text start="886.81" dur="9.339">that point over and over and over again</text>
  <text start="893.68" dur="5.379">skipping further down in Galatians 3</text>
  <text start="896.149" dur="4.531">wherefore then serves the law now here</text>
  <text start="899.059" dur="3.811">he is he&amp;#39;s talking about Torah here it</text>
  <text start="900.68" dur="3.599">was added because of transgressions till</text>
  <text start="902.87" dur="3.569">the seed should come to whom the promise</text>

  <text start="909.559" dur="6">is not a mediator of one but yah as one</text>
  <text start="911.98" dur="6.789">is the law then against the promises of</text>
  <text start="915.559" dur="4.83">yah yah forbid for if there had been a</text>
  <text start="918.769" dur="3.601">law given which could have given life</text>
  <text start="920.389" dur="3.961">verily righteousness should have been</text>
  <text start="922.37" dur="4.05">by the law but the scripture hath</text>
  <text start="924.35" dur="4.38">concluded all under sin that the promise</text>
  <text start="926.42" dur="5.49">by faith of Yahshua HaMashiach might be</text>
  <text start="928.73" dur="5.37">given to them that belief before faith</text>
  <text start="931.91" dur="4.02">came we were kept under the law shut up</text>
  <text start="934.1" dur="4.77">unto the faith which should afterwards</text>
  <text start="935.93" dur="4.65">be revealed wherefore the law was our</text>
  <text start="938.87" dur="4.32">schoolmaster to bring us unto messiah</text>
  <text start="940.58" dur="4.05">that we might be justified by faith now</text>
  <text start="943.19" dur="3.75">is Paul saying that once we come to</text>
  <text start="944.63" dur="3.69">Messiah we throw away the law no he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="946.94" dur="4.11">not saying that that would be ridiculous</text>
  <text start="948.32" dur="6.36">because parts of a law are do not commit</text>
  <text start="951.05" dur="5.43">adultery do not cheat do not bear false</text>
  <text start="954.68" dur="5.34">witness we obviously know we don&amp;#39;t throw</text>
  <text start="956.48" dur="6.39">away those things but before we come to</text>
  <text start="960.02" dur="4.5">Messiah that very law does not bring us</text>
  <text start="962.87" dur="3.17">life all it does is condemn us it just</text>
  <text start="964.52" dur="4.08">shows us what we&amp;#39;ve done wrong</text>
  <text start="966.04" dur="4.66">after we come to the Messiah after we</text>
  <text start="968.6" dur="4.95">fall in love with him those very same</text>
  <text start="970.7" dur="5.34">laws that once condemned us and and and</text>
  <text start="973.55" dur="5.4">accused us now they bring us life</text>
  <text start="976.04" dur="5.1">because now we love him so we joyfully</text>
  <text start="978.95" dur="4.079">want to obey these things we want to</text>
  <text start="981.14" dur="7.05">obey these Commandments that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="983.029" dur="9.391">essence of the gospel all right going</text>
  <text start="988.19" dur="6.45">into Galatians 4 now I say that the heir</text>
  <text start="992.42" dur="5.49">as long as he is a child differs nothing</text>
  <text start="994.64" dur="5.43">nothing from a servant though he be Lord</text>
  <text start="997.91" dur="4.29">of all but as under tutors and governors</text>
  <text start="1000.07" dur="5.58">until the time appointed of the Father</text>
  <text start="1002.2" dur="5.19">even so we when we were children were in</text>
  <text start="1005.65" dur="3.93">bondage under the elements of the world</text>
  <text start="1007.39" dur="4.23">but when the fullness of time has come</text>
  <text start="1009.58" dur="5.4">yaahh sent forth his son made of a woman</text>
  <text start="1011.62" dur="5.4">made under the Torah to redeem them that</text>
  <text start="1014.98" dur="3.69">were under the Tor that we might receive</text>
  <text start="1017.02" dur="3.3">the adoption of sons so that again that</text>
  <text start="1018.67" dur="3.84">phrase under the Torah</text>
  <text start="1020.32" dur="5.31">it literally means under the curse of</text>
  <text start="1022.51" dur="5.189">the Torah and Yahshua has set us free</text>
  <text start="1025.63" dur="4.069">from being under the curse of the Torah</text>
  <text start="1027.699" dur="4.531">the condemnation that the Torah brings</text>
  <text start="1029.699" dur="5.321">and why are we no longer under the</text>
  <text start="1032.23" dur="6.54">condemnation of tor brings well there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1035.02" dur="4.38">two reasons one his blood washes us from</text>
  <text start="1038.77" dur="3.299">our sins</text>
  <text start="1039.4" dur="5.159">okay and atones for our sins and number</text>
  <text start="1042.069" dur="4.561">two now his spirit fills us so that we</text>
  <text start="1044.559" dur="6.001">can walk in those very laws that we used</text>
  <text start="1046.63" dur="6.21">to break we can actually obey them we</text>
  <text start="1050.56" dur="5.15">can actually walk as the Messiah walked</text>

  <text start="1058.62" dur="8.61">and help us to walk in his Commandments</text>
  <text start="1061.47" dur="8.459">this is the true gospel but the</text>

  <text start="1263.36" dur="5.64">unto all men especially unto them which</text>
  <text start="1266.299" dur="4.711">are of the household of faith you see</text>

  <text start="1271.01" dur="5.61">you with mine own hand as many as desire</text>
  <text start="1273.74" dur="5.189">to make a fair show in the flesh they</text>
  <text start="1276.62" dur="4.65">constrain you to be circumcised only</text>
  <text start="1278.929" dur="4.651">lest they should suffer persecution for</text>
  <text start="1281.27" dur="5.43">the cross of Messiah again we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1283.58" dur="5.43">about that acts 15 circumcision the</text>
  <text start="1286.7" dur="4.89">circumcision of Moses which is again</text>
  <text start="1289.01" dur="5.1">this induction into all these rules and</text>
  <text start="1291.59" dur="6.209">regulations invented by men a yoke of</text>
  <text start="1294.11" dur="5.73">bondage that no man can bear and the</text>
  <text start="1297.799" dur="3.541">motivation was also that they could say</text>
  <text start="1299.84" dur="3.69">hey look these people are followers of</text>
  <text start="1301.34" dur="4.44">us we&amp;#39;ve imposed the system of</text>
  <text start="1303.53" dur="2.94">regulations on them well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1305.78" dur="3.75">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1306.47" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s utterly ridiculous and Paul could</text>
  <text start="1309.53" dur="2.22">have easily started teaching that and</text>
  <text start="1310.76" dur="2.43">then he wouldn&amp;#39;t have had any</text>
  <text start="1311.75" dur="3.66">persecution from the Jews but he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1313.19" dur="4.739">teaching that he was teaching that you</text>
  <text start="1315.41" dur="5.11">are justified by the Spirit of God by</text>
  <text start="1317.929" dur="5.591">his son by his blood and then you go in</text>
  <text start="1320.52" dur="3.96">the commandments into the Torah and then</text>
  <text start="1323.52" dur="3.33">guess what</text>
  <text start="1324.48" dur="3.99">then Yan receives all the glory because</text>
  <text start="1326.85" dur="3.57">the only way that you can do all these</text>
  <text start="1328.47" dur="3.74">other things in Torah is because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1330.42" dur="9.27">living within you so he gets the glory</text>
  <text start="1332.21" dur="9.64">not men now verse 13 is very very very</text>
  <text start="1339.69" dur="4.77">revealing for it says for neither they</text>
  <text start="1341.85" dur="4.8">themselves who are circumcised to keep</text>
  <text start="1344.46" dur="4.23">the law but desire to have you</text>
  <text start="1346.65" dur="4.35">circumcised that they may glory in your</text>
  <text start="1348.69" dur="4.77">flesh so these guys who were</text>
  <text start="1351" dur="3.96">quote-unquote circumsized they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1353.46" dur="4.86">even keeping the very Torah that they</text>
  <text start="1354.96" dur="6.3">were telling others to keep they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1358.32" dur="6.72">and this is that statement is repeated</text>
  <text start="1361.26" dur="6.24">by messiah in matthew 23:23 which was</text>
  <text start="1365.04" dur="5.28">also one of the three principles that I</text>
  <text start="1367.5" dur="4.65">went over in in part one where Yahshua</text>
  <text start="1370.32" dur="3.78">rebukes the Pharisees and says warn to</text>
  <text start="1372.15" dur="4.44">you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for</text>
  <text start="1374.1" dur="4.26">you pay tithe of mint and anis and cumin</text>
  <text start="1376.59" dur="4.86">and you have omitted the weightier</text>
  <text start="1378.36" dur="5.67">matters of the Torah judgment mercy and</text>
  <text start="1381.45" dur="5.28">faith these ought you to have done and</text>
  <text start="1384.03" dur="4.59">not to leave the other undone so</text>
  <text start="1386.73" dur="3.42">messiahs not saying stop keeping these</text>
  <text start="1388.62" dur="5.04">small jobs and tools of Torah he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1390.15" dur="6">saying do all the Torah do it all but</text>
  <text start="1393.66" dur="4.83">you see they hit a mini mitad judgment</text>
  <text start="1396.15" dur="4.77">mercy and faith and that&amp;#39;s what these</text>
  <text start="1398.49" dur="3.81">Pharisees trying to beguile these new</text>
  <text start="1400.92" dur="3.03">Galatian believers were also trying to</text>
  <text start="1402.3" dur="5.16">do they were trying to present a Torah</text>
  <text start="1403.95" dur="7.74">that did not have mercy judgment or</text>
  <text start="1407.46" dur="5.79">faith which is really no tour at all and</text>
  <text start="1411.69" dur="3.239">so that&amp;#39;s why Paul says they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1413.25" dur="3.45">circumcised but they don&amp;#39;t even keep the</text>
  <text start="1414.929" dur="5.25">very law but they&amp;#39;re trying to impose</text>
  <text start="1416.7" dur="5.64">upon you but yah forbid that I should</text>
  <text start="1420.179" dur="4.351">glory start to picking up in verse 14 of</text>
  <text start="1422.34" dur="5.4">Galatians 6 yah forbid that I should</text>
  <text start="1424.53" dur="4.8">glory save in the cross of our Yahshua</text>
  <text start="1427.74" dur="3.56">HaMashiach by whom the world is</text>
  <text start="1429.33" dur="4.26">crucified unto me and I end of the world</text>
  <text start="1431.3" dur="4.18">for in Messiah Yahshua neither</text>
  <text start="1433.59" dur="3.63">circumcision which again the</text>
  <text start="1435.48" dur="3.36">circumcision of Moses the rules and</text>
  <text start="1437.22" dur="3.69">regulations of men that have been</text>
  <text start="1438.84" dur="5.07">invented availeth anything nor</text>
  <text start="1440.91" dur="4.649">uncircumcision but a new creature in</text>
  <text start="1443.91" dur="3.66">other words these traditions these</text>
  <text start="1445.559" dur="3.481">regulations invented by men these</text>
  <text start="1447.57" dur="3.05">traditions of the fathers that have</text>
  <text start="1449.04" dur="4.26">nothing to do with the written Torah</text>
  <text start="1450.62" dur="3.25">whether you obey them or not it means</text>
  <text start="1453.3" dur="2.58">nothing</text>
  <text start="1453.87" dur="4.47">what does matter is being a new creation</text>
  <text start="1455.88" dur="4.8">in messiah allowing the son of man to</text>
  <text start="1458.34" dur="6.03">form in you so that you can then walk in</text>
  <text start="1460.68" dur="5.22">his laws and his commandments and as</text>
  <text start="1464.37" dur="4.83">many as walk according to this rule</text>
  <text start="1465.9" dur="6.75">peace Shalom be upon him and mercy and</text>
  <text start="1469.2" dur="5.85">upon the Israel of yawns from henceforth</text>
  <text start="1472.65" dur="4.52">let no man trouble me for I bear in my</text>
  <text start="1475.05" dur="5.25">body the marks of our Aten ieshua</text>
  <text start="1477.17" dur="5.08">brethren the grace of our Adonai Yahshua</text>
  <text start="1480.3" dur="3.48">HaMashiach be with you the with your</text>
  <text start="1482.25" dur="4.29">spirits Amin</text>
  <text start="1483.78" dur="5.61">so Paul very very very clearly shows</text>
  <text start="1486.54" dur="5.82">what the true gospel is exposes what the</text>
  <text start="1489.39" dur="6.27">false gospel is but in no way does he</text>
  <text start="1492.36" dur="5.4">tell people not to obey the Torah in</text>
  <text start="1495.66" dur="4.32">fact if anything he says keep away from</text>
  <text start="1497.76" dur="5.13">the traditions of men which pervert the</text>
  <text start="1499.98" dur="4.59">Torah and really is no tour at all but</text>
  <text start="1502.89" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s just a system and body of</text>
  <text start="1504.57" dur="5.34">regulations alright I know this is a</text>
  <text start="1507.45" dur="4.32">longer part than normal but this is the</text>
  <text start="1509.91" dur="3.75">book of Galatians that sorely needs to</text>
  <text start="1511.77" dur="3.96">be understood by both the Messianic</text>
  <text start="1513.66" dur="4.17">movement and by the Christians so that</text>
  <text start="1515.73" dur="4.26">we understand that Paul and Messiah they</text>
  <text start="1517.83" dur="4.59">both encourage us to obey the</text>
