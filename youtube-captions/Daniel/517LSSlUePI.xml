  <text start="0" dur="3.33">five you could then conceivably start</text>
  <text start="1.5" dur="6.419">the Great Tribulation which would go</text>
  <text start="3.33" dur="7.38">into the fall of 20 28 when Yahshua</text>
  <text start="7.919" dur="9.841">would return let&amp;#39;s make this a little</text>
  <text start="10.71" dur="10.31">prettier so you have here a potential</text>
  <text start="17.76" dur="10.769">trump presidency very similar to this</text>
  <text start="21.02" dur="9.07">temple of concord temple of concord and</text>
  <text start="28.529" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s interesting it takes a couple years</text>
  <text start="30.09" dur="3.809">about 23 years for it to build and</text>
  <text start="32.009" dur="3.271">trumpet said it would take about two</text>
  <text start="33.899" dur="3.511">years of his presidency to build that</text>
  <text start="35.28" dur="4.26">wall so it&amp;#39;s interesting the parallel is</text>
  <text start="37.41" dur="4.38">there as well also there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="39.54" dur="3.69">raging riots that try to attack trump</text>
  <text start="41.79" dur="4.44">when he goes to different places and</text>
  <text start="43.23" dur="4.5">this temple was used for a place where</text>
  <text start="46.23" dur="3.27">the Senate could meet to protect them</text>
  <text start="47.73" dur="4.98">from raging rock moms so there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="49.5" dur="7.07">of similarities and so you have the</text>
  <text start="52.71" dur="7.169">truck presidency and then around 20 20</text>
  <text start="56.57" dur="4.239">20 25 or so he leaves office and then a</text>
  <text start="59.879" dur="3.121">couple months though there you could</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="3.42">have that Great Tribulation begin at</text>
  <text start="63" dur="6.119">three and a half year Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="64.229" dur="9">and we&amp;#39;ll stick 20-27 right here so you</text>
  <text start="69.119" dur="8.61">got another ten years just a little bit</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="6.75">more until fall 2028 well picture</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="3.661">Yashiro turning on yom teruah which is</text>
  <text start="79.979" dur="3.03">the piece of trumpets he returns for his</text>
  <text start="81.39" dur="3.9">bride we meet him in the air the dead</text>
  <text start="83.009" dur="3.93">rise first we meet Ephraim and Judah are</text>
  <text start="85.29" dur="3.75">finally joined together in the air he</text>
  <text start="86.939" dur="3.951">gathers us in the air we come down with</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="6.21">him to Jerusalem that that would be</text>
  <text start="90.89" dur="6.64">right here symbolize that blue Yasha</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="5.76">returning</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="5.22">Lou Yap and then we&amp;#39;ll use red again to</text>
  <text start="101.01" dur="4.94">symbolize that Great Tribulation from</text>
  <text start="102.75" dur="5.34">the spring of 2025 to the fall of 2028</text>
  <text start="105.95" dur="4.209">great tribulation has to begin in the</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="3.72">spring because the fall feast have been</text>
  <text start="110.159" dur="3.241">fulfilled yet and that first of all P so</text>
  <text start="111.81" dur="4.23">mature will happen in the fall of course</text>
  <text start="113.4" dur="5.009">when Yahshua it comes forth right so</text>
  <text start="116.04" dur="5.55">that you have the great tribulation lots</text>
  <text start="118.409" dur="7.621">of blood falls during that three and a</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="6.869">half year period now not in any way</text>
  <text start="126.03" dur="4.11">denigrating Trump I&amp;#39;m an avid supporter</text>
  <text start="128.459" dur="2.941">of Trump but you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="130.14" dur="3.18">people who support Trump and are not</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="3.6">necessarily pure even shut himself has</text>
  <text start="133.32" dur="3.63">to draw closer to you and hopefully he</text>
  <text start="135" dur="3.81">will and learn more things just like</text>
  <text start="136.95" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s a lot of paganism that was in</text>
  <text start="138.81" dur="4.86">temple of Concorde and yet he wants to a</text>
  <text start="141.51" dur="3.69">lot of right things setting a standards</text>
  <text start="143.67" dur="3.18">of righteousness delineating right and</text>
  <text start="145.2" dur="4.74">wrong building that wall building walls</text>
  <text start="146.85" dur="5.219">of tourists naughty but it&amp;#39;s symbolic of</text>
  <text start="149.94" dur="4.14">allowing us to be able to build walls of</text>
  <text start="152.069" dur="3.511">Torah and actually that does tell</text>
  <text start="154.08" dur="4.439">dovetails into what I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="155.58" dur="4.89">next so I believe just like in the 80s</text>
  <text start="158.519" dur="3.421">where the church was very militant if</text>
  <text start="160.47" dur="2.73">you study the 1980s when Reagan was</text>
  <text start="161.94" dur="2.88">president reagan may not have been</text>
  <text start="163.2" dur="3.48">necessarily righteous but he did a lot</text>
  <text start="164.82" dur="4.68">of good things and it allowed the church</text>
  <text start="166.68" dur="4.68">to rise up in militancy in terms of</text>
  <text start="169.5" dur="3.57">righteousness if you remember I remember</text>
  <text start="171.36" dur="3.18">my own parents would block the borscht</text>
  <text start="173.07" dur="3.09">in clinics and a lot of the church in</text>
  <text start="174.54" dur="2.91">Operation Rescue would block abortion</text>
  <text start="176.16" dur="2.82">clinics you don&amp;#39;t see that a lot in the</text>
  <text start="177.45" dur="3.9">layout dicey and lukewarm Church of</text>
  <text start="178.98" dur="3.75">today but you did that in the 1980s in</text>
  <text start="181.35" dur="4.169">the same way I think Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="4.349">foster conditions to allow messy NX</text>
  <text start="185.519" dur="3.361">Christians to rise up in righteousness</text>
  <text start="187.079" dur="3.541">and there will be a revival where that</text>
  <text start="188.88" dur="3.93">Yahshua says this gospel has to be</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="3.869">preached in all the world before the and</text>
  <text start="192.81" dur="3.75">then the end will come so it will be a</text>
  <text start="194.489" dur="4.261">major revival not just politically but</text>
  <text start="196.56" dur="4.29">spiritually this huger Bible but if you</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="4.019">study a history of revivals just in the</text>
  <text start="200.85" dur="3.359">last two to three hundred years in the</text>
  <text start="202.769" dur="3.121">United States and what would come become</text>
  <text start="204.209" dur="3.331">the United States you have these</text>
  <text start="205.89" dur="3.24">revivals these explosions of the Holy</text>
  <text start="207.54" dur="3.63">Spirit the Ruach but then that it gets</text>
  <text start="209.13" dur="4.109">corrupted and even if you go back to the</text>
  <text start="211.17" dur="3.39">first century you know in the first</text>
  <text start="213.239" dur="3.361">century we read about the most</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="3.81">incredible revival we see in the book of</text>
  <text start="216.6" dur="3.24">Acts and yet we know by the end of the</text>
  <text start="218.37" dur="3.51">first century became corrupt because</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="5.399">Paul warned about wolves rising in the</text>
  <text start="221.88" dur="5.01">midst even yoga Don John Dee the Apostle</text>
  <text start="225.239" dur="3.011">he wrote first second third guiding it</text>
  <text start="226.89" dur="2.85">says horrible Gnostic</text>
  <text start="228.25" dur="5.46">our see that invaded the early churches</text>
  <text start="229.74" dur="5.68">because basically it was Gnosticism that</text>
  <text start="233.71" dur="3.54">was teaching your spirit man&amp;#39;s in heaven</text>
  <text start="235.42" dur="4.14">that you can sin all you want with your</text>
  <text start="237.25" dur="3.69">with your body horrible heresy that</text>
  <text start="239.56" dur="2.82">invaded a lot of the first century</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="3.48">churches by the end of the century so</text>
  <text start="242.38" dur="4.47">revivals come and then corruption comes</text>
  <text start="244.42" dur="4.11">in and so I think what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="246.85" dur="3.81">see is Trump is elected president</text>
  <text start="248.53" dur="4.14">fosters the conditions for revival we</text>
  <text start="250.66" dur="3.87">see a lot of amazing revival going on</text>
  <text start="252.67" dur="4.2">and I&amp;#39;m talking about genuine true</text>
  <text start="254.53" dur="3.84">revival of repentance turning to yah but</text>
  <text start="256.87" dur="3.63">fruit to that repentance of moving in</text>
  <text start="258.37" dur="4.23">the the gifts of the Spirit but then as</text>
  <text start="260.5" dur="4.65">with every revival it can get corrupted</text>
  <text start="262.6" dur="4.44">our eyes can get off of yah and you know</text>
  <text start="265.15" dur="3.72">it even warns Israel in the Torah when</text>
  <text start="267.04" dur="3.44">they become fat and flourishing and</text>
  <text start="268.87" dur="3.99">everything that started beginning</text>
  <text start="270.48" dur="4.23">self-sustaining self-reliance and they</text>
  <text start="272.86" dur="4.83">forget to thank ya things get back</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="5.44">Romans 1 says that the first step to a</text>
  <text start="277.69" dur="4.14">really degenerate and wicked state is</text>
  <text start="280.15" dur="3.3">lack of Thanksgiving so that can happen</text>
  <text start="281.83" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s we have to be on guard against</text>
  <text start="283.45" dur="3.96">but this huge reliable occurs and I</text>
  <text start="285.82" dur="3.36">think Trump could even because he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="287.41" dur="3.38">master negotiator help negotiate that</text>
  <text start="289.18" dur="5.43">temple thing though you know we saw</text>
  <text start="290.79" dur="6.129">Israel Take Back the Land in 1948 and</text>
  <text start="294.61" dur="4.44">then in 1967 they took back the city of</text>
  <text start="296.919" dur="4.021">Jerusalem now in 2017 I think it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="4.29">possible they could take get the temple</text>
  <text start="300.94" dur="3.57">but there&amp;#39;s this misnomer that Obama and</text>
  <text start="303.34" dur="2.93">the Muslims and all this up are</text>
  <text start="304.51" dur="5.04">antichrists that Obama&amp;#39;s an antichrist</text>
  <text start="306.27" dur="4.81">Obama is not an antichrist because huge</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="4.41">sections the population don&amp;#39;t like them</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="4.23">and the revelation says that all the</text>
  <text start="313.96" dur="3.57">world&amp;#39;s going to be amazed by the</text>
  <text start="315.31" dur="4.32">Antichrist all the world the Muslims</text>
  <text start="317.53" dur="3.54">they I&amp;#39;ve heard people say Muslims are</text>
  <text start="319.63" dur="4.8">the Antichrist well they&amp;#39;re a hellish</text>
  <text start="321.07" dur="4.47">religion but a there are many enter</text>
  <text start="324.43" dur="3.96">Christ in the world but not the</text>
  <text start="325.54" dur="4.41">Antichrist remember it says it if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="328.39" dur="4.4">possibly doing the very elect would be</text>
  <text start="329.95" dur="5.19">deceived so here&amp;#39;s what we have here</text>
  <text start="332.79" dur="4.24">Trump I think is going to take out Isis</text>
  <text start="335.14" dur="3.48">when demolish ah the Muslims either</text>
  <text start="337.03" dur="4.26">through war and through negotiation and</text>
  <text start="338.62" dur="4.26">peace a combination and allow the Jews</text>
  <text start="341.29" dur="3.39">to be able to rebuild their temple and</text>
  <text start="342.88" dur="3.99">it could very well come in this Jubilee</text>
  <text start="344.68" dur="3.87">year doesn&amp;#39;t mean Trump Stanek Christ by</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="3">the way there&amp;#39;s this bad teaching by how</text>
  <text start="348.55" dur="2.67">Lindsay that there&amp;#39;s the seven-year</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="3.15">priest reading all the stuff that comes</text>
  <text start="351.22" dur="3.15">from Daniel 9 and that&amp;#39;s not even with</text>
  <text start="353.02" dur="3.18">Daniel nice talking about and I have a</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="3.09">whole nother teaching on that Daniel 9</text>
  <text start="356.2" dur="2.369">has three and a half and three and a</text>
  <text start="357.46" dur="2.159">half years that make</text>
  <text start="358.569" dur="3.09">there&amp;#39;s no three and a half years</text>
  <text start="359.619" dur="3.27">happened way back here in yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="361.659" dur="2.37">ministry and you got another three and a</text>
  <text start="362.889" dur="2.67">half years are fulfilled in the Great</text>
  <text start="364.029" dur="4.051">Tribulation there&amp;#39;s a gap and I have old</text>
  <text start="365.559" dur="4.47">teaching on that about that and i&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="368.08" dur="5.19">post the link to that as well but in any</text>
  <text start="370.029" dur="4.95">case truck negotiates these things a lot</text>
  <text start="373.27" dur="2.939">of prosperity and peace is brought and</text>
  <text start="374.979" dur="4.68">then shortly after he leaves office</text>
  <text start="376.209" dur="6.3">after two terms you then have this the</text>
  <text start="379.659" dur="7.141">conditions set and write for a Great</text>
  <text start="382.509" dur="6.24">Tribulation Period here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="386.8" dur="4.139">deception or the thing that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="388.749" dur="3.84">really look it looks good and great at</text>
  <text start="390.939" dur="5.13">first and it really is it&amp;#39;s a move of</text>
  <text start="392.589" dur="4.95">yacht but what you have is you have two</text>
  <text start="396.069" dur="2.96">sides you have on the christian side</text>
  <text start="397.539" dur="3.511">what sometimes Dominion theology</text>
  <text start="399.029" dur="3.34">Dominion theology teaches that the</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="2.909">Christian Church will eventually take</text>
  <text start="402.369" dur="3.54">over the world they&amp;#39;ll take over</text>
  <text start="403.959" dur="4.591">Hollywood and the news and the media and</text>
  <text start="405.909" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;ll take over different educational</text>
  <text start="408.55" dur="2.969">institutions they&amp;#39;ll take over the world</text>
  <text start="409.779" dur="3.78">and they&amp;#39;ll prepare the world for Christ</text>
  <text start="411.519" dur="3.48">and then the Christ will appear pre</text>
  <text start="413.559" dur="3.12">tourism is similar to Dominion theology</text>
  <text start="414.999" dur="3.06">it believes all the prophecies in</text>
  <text start="416.679" dur="3.181">Revelation have already happened it</text>
  <text start="418.059" dur="4.771">happened back in 70 AD when the temple</text>
  <text start="419.86" dur="5.039">was destroyed and so there is no Great</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="3.389">Tribulation and Dominion theology is</text>
  <text start="424.899" dur="2.781">very similar to that as well and it</text>
  <text start="426.219" dur="4.26">permeates a lot of nondenominational</text>
  <text start="427.68" dur="4.269">charismatic assemblies of god many</text>
  <text start="430.479" dur="3.511">different Christian denominations it</text>
  <text start="431.949" dur="4.411">first actually began in a Roman Catholic</text>
  <text start="433.99" dur="3.449">Church but it&amp;#39;s this teaching that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="436.36" dur="4.049">going to bring about the Millennium</text>
  <text start="437.439" dur="4.56">ourselves to the arm of the flesh so</text>
  <text start="440.409" dur="3.21">that&amp;#39;s one side the other side is that</text>
  <text start="441.999" dur="4.111">on the Messianic Jewish Hebrew roots</text>
  <text start="443.619" dur="5.431">Orthodox Jewish tamluk side is Kabbalah</text>
  <text start="446.11" dur="5.789">and this understanding that we can sort</text>
  <text start="449.05" dur="4.589">of rejoin Judah and Ephraim on our own</text>
  <text start="451.899" dur="3.6">for our own flesh there&amp;#39;s this whole</text>
  <text start="453.639" dur="3.721">greater Exodus thing that&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="455.499" dur="3.63">that scam camps where how we make this</text>
  <text start="457.36" dur="4.649">greater exodus of Judah and Ephraim go</text>
  <text start="459.129" dur="4.74">to Israel well there is a woman fleeing</text>
  <text start="462.009" dur="3.51">in the wilderness but there get seat</text>
  <text start="463.869" dur="2.88">she&amp;#39;s not going to Jerusalem she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="465.519" dur="3.12">fleeing into the wilderness she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466.749" dur="3.69">fleeing into a safe place the dragon</text>
  <text start="468.639" dur="3.87">can&amp;#39;t get her this is a whole greater</text>
  <text start="470.439" dur="5.13">Exodus or rejoining of Ephraim and Judah</text>
  <text start="472.509" dur="4.86">is a counterfeit and it&amp;#39;s actually going</text>
  <text start="475.569" dur="4.2">to be designed to enthrone the anti</text>
  <text start="477.369" dur="4.17">Messiah and so there&amp;#39;s gonna be a lot of</text>
  <text start="479.769" dur="3.69">confusion with that for people&amp;#39;s hearts</text>
  <text start="481.539" dur="2.691">that are not ready and not prepared not</text>
  <text start="483.459" dur="3.561">pure</text>
  <text start="484.23" dur="4.92">young so you have the Kabbalah which is</text>
  <text start="487.02" dur="4.02">a sorcery mystical understanding of</text>
  <text start="489.15" dur="3.33">Torah and it&amp;#39;s not really even having to</text>
  <text start="491.04" dur="3.54">do with porous or replacement for the</text>
  <text start="492.48" dur="4.83">Ruach it has the trappings of Torah but</text>
  <text start="494.58" dur="5.04">really isn&amp;#39;t and so you have Kabbalah</text>
  <text start="497.31" dur="4.17">and then you have Christendom Dominion</text>
  <text start="499.62" dur="3.99">theology the two sides will marry and it</text>
  <text start="501.48" dur="4.2">will from this messianic glorious figure</text>
  <text start="503.61" dur="3.93">that will look very close to the real</text>
  <text start="505.68" dur="3.57">thing but won&amp;#39;t be and if even they&amp;#39;ll</text>
