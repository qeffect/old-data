  <text start="8.82" dur="5.91">is my weekly sabbath podcast and this is</text>
  <text start="11.7" dur="5.85">episode 36 the one thing above yah</text>
  <text start="14.73" dur="5.04">himself this comes from my teaching in</text>
  <text start="17.55" dur="6.69">the teachings section from the website</text>
  <text start="19.77" dur="5.49">called the pond tenant and the Torah if</text>
  <text start="24.24" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;re not familiar with the term</text>
  <text start="25.26" dur="8.7">continent or potent it is a term meaning</text>
  <text start="27.81" dur="9.179">a king or supreme ruler most Christians</text>
  <text start="33.96" dur="6.57">can agree that Jesus Yeshua Yeshua the</text>
  <text start="36.989" dur="6.361">Messiah of Israel is the continent of</text>
  <text start="40.53" dur="4.439">continents or the king of kings but how</text>
  <text start="43.35" dur="4.1">many of you are familiar with the psalm</text>
  <text start="44.969" dur="8.011">in which the psalmist declares that yah</text>
  <text start="47.45" dur="7.87">places his word above his name indeed</text>
  <text start="52.98" dur="6.599">there are even some Christians who teach</text>
  <text start="55.32" dur="8.729">that the Lord God must submit himself to</text>
  <text start="59.579" dur="7.441">his own word so if we know that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="64.049" dur="6.091">is the supreme ruler the king of kings</text>
  <text start="67.02" dur="6.709">and yet the psalmist declares that this</text>
  <text start="70.14" dur="7.2">king of kings baus his knee to the Torah</text>
  <text start="73.729" dur="6.221">part of his everlasting word why do</text>
  <text start="77.34" dur="5.25">Christians hold this Torah in such</text>
  <text start="79.95" dur="7.32">disdain why did they say it is not</text>
  <text start="82.59" dur="7.349">required indeed the gospel records prove</text>
  <text start="87.27" dur="5.459">that Yahshua about his knee to the Torah</text>
  <text start="89.939" dur="4.741">in fact even after Yahshua was</text>
  <text start="92.729" dur="4.5">resurrected and glorified when he could</text>
  <text start="94.68" dur="5.88">walk through walls etc did we see him</text>
  <text start="97.229" dur="7.14">breaking torah know when he ate with the</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="7.519">disciples he ate fish not pig he still</text>
  <text start="104.369" dur="6.39">abided by the precepts found in torah</text>
  <text start="108.079" dur="5.08">indeed even now that Yahshua is once</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="4.531">again enthroned between the cherubim</text>
  <text start="113.159" dur="4.5">glorified and manish the up in the third</text>
  <text start="115.29" dur="7.31">heaven despite all of his power and</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="8.581">majesty he still vows his knee to Torah</text>
  <text start="122.6" dur="6.879">what is clear from Holy Writ from</text>
  <text start="126.24" dur="7.02">Genesis to Revelation is that yah will</text>
  <text start="129.479" dur="7.111">not break his law he</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="7.979">will not break his Torah for yah will</text>
  <text start="136.59" dur="8.069">not ever choose to sin to transgress the</text>
  <text start="141.239" dur="5.881">Torah remember sin is transgression of</text>
  <text start="144.659" dur="6.601">the Torah according to first John 3</text>
  <text start="147.12" dur="6.179">verse for some accused me of making too</text>
  <text start="151.26" dur="4.94">big an issue of Torah or Torah</text>
  <text start="153.299" dur="5.761">observance but that is absolutely absurd</text>
  <text start="156.2" dur="4.569">how can I make too big of an issue the</text>
  <text start="159.06" dur="4.379">very law the very instructions which</text>
  <text start="160.769" dur="8.371">even the King of Kings follows obeys and</text>
  <text start="163.439" dur="8.91">places over his own name we know his</text>
  <text start="169.14" dur="5.58">name Yahshua or Jesus has awesome power</text>
  <text start="172.349" dur="5.01">the ability to drive out devils and</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="5.849">raise the dead yet is powerful and</text>
  <text start="177.359" dur="7.591">wonderful as his name is his Torah is</text>
  <text start="180.569" dur="7.491">set even above this the Torah of Moshe</text>
  <text start="184.95" dur="7.89">or rather the Torah given Tim O&amp;#39;Shea is</text>
  <text start="188.06" dur="6.31">above Yahweh the tour of moshe is the</text>
  <text start="192.84" dur="6">standard by which the King of Kings</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="9.089">operates the tour of moshe a rules the</text>
  <text start="198.84" dur="6.179">King of Kings period yet Christians and</text>
  <text start="203.459" dur="3.12">many messy annex decide simply that</text>
  <text start="205.019" dur="3.661">keeping every jot and tittle of the</text>
  <text start="206.579" dur="7.081">Torah is either impossible or not</text>
  <text start="208.68" dur="7.019">required not required not required how</text>
  <text start="213.66" dur="3.93">can they live out such blasphemy when</text>
  <text start="215.699" dur="5.22">keeping Torah is even required of the</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="5.34">potent it Yahshua himself or a Christian</text>
  <text start="220.919" dur="4.111">so bold as to suggest that Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="5.97">seated on his throne breaking the tour</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="5.76">of Moshe willy-nilly indeed they will</text>
  <text start="228.9" dur="4.32">soon have a false messiah who does this</text>
  <text start="230.79" dur="4.589">who might come in the name of Jesus or</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="4.71">Yeshua but will be a devil claiming the</text>
  <text start="235.379" dur="4.651">need to keep Torah is not necessary and</text>
  <text start="237.93" dur="5.399">know how the many Christians and even</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="6.179">Messianic swill adore this apostate holy</text>
  <text start="243.329" dur="5.28">route is clear the Torah is placed even</text>
  <text start="246.209" dur="4.321">above Yahweh if this be the case how</text>
  <text start="248.609" dur="3.78">much more important is it for us as</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="4.169">followers of Yahweh as disciples of</text>
  <text start="252.389" dur="4.831">Yahweh to keep every jot and tittle of</text>
  <text start="254.699" dur="4.771">the Torah indeed our prayer should be</text>
  <text start="257.22" dur="5.31">that yah magnifies the Torah and makes</text>
  <text start="259.47" dur="4.949">it honorable across this earth yet</text>
  <text start="262.53" dur="3.96">Christians and many messianic SAR busy</text>
  <text start="264.419" dur="2.551">doing the exact opposite bringing shame</text>
  <text start="266.49" dur="2.49">to the</text>
  <text start="266.97" dur="6.69">and reproach upon those who dare to</text>
  <text start="268.98" dur="6.84">manga magnify the Torah both Polycarp</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="4.98">and John Wesley agree with my doctrine</text>
  <text start="275.82" dur="7.44">in fact listen to what John Wesley says</text>
  <text start="278.64" dur="8.94">of the passage and found in Matthew 5 17</text>
  <text start="283.26" dur="6.36">through 21 he says and I quote I am not</text>
  <text start="287.58" dur="3.63">come to destroy but to fulfill without</text>
  <text start="289.62" dur="3.51">question his meaning in this place is</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="4.47">consistently with all that goes before</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="4.92">and follows after I am come to establish</text>
  <text start="295.68" dur="4.38">it the Old Testament law in its fullness</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="4.5">in spite of all the glosses of men</text>
  <text start="300.06" dur="5.55">Jewish traditions I am come to place in</text>
  <text start="302.55" dur="6">a full and clear view whatsoever was</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="5.61">dark and obscure therein I am come to</text>
  <text start="308.55" dur="5.55">declare the true and full import of</text>
  <text start="311.22" dur="5.22">every part of the Old Testament law to</text>
  <text start="314.1" dur="4.83">show the length and breadth the entire</text>
  <text start="316.44" dur="4.59">extent of every commandment contained</text>
  <text start="318.93" dur="4.14">within the Old Testament law and the</text>
  <text start="321.03" dur="5.84">height and depth the inconceivable</text>
  <text start="323.07" dur="9.63">purity and spirituality of it in all</text>
  <text start="326.87" dur="9.94">branches now according to John Wesley&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.7" dur="7.88">quote why do christians believe that</text>
  <text start="336.81" dur="7.59">Torah is not required for us to follow</text>
  <text start="340.58" dur="6.64">that is certainly not what john leslie</text>
  <text start="344.4" dur="6.6">thought of the subject and this is very</text>
  <text start="347.22" dur="5.94">clear from his quote if i could sit in</text>
  <text start="351" dur="3.78">the same room as Charles Finney I could</text>
  <text start="353.16" dur="4.43">probably easily persuade him of this</text>
  <text start="354.78" dur="5.34">doctrine the Apostle yoking on himself</text>
  <text start="357.59" dur="4.84">taught this doctrine and it was passed</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="3.87">down to his disciple Polycarp it is</text>
  <text start="362.43" dur="3.89">recorded and if you look up in the</text>
