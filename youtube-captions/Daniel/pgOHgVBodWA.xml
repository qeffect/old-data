  <text start="9.389" dur="5.341">read my articles and watched my pack has</text>
  <text start="11.79" dur="4.829">to my website you know that I have said</text>
  <text start="14.73" dur="5.67">that the abomination of desolation will</text>
  <text start="16.619" dur="6.631">occur on March 11th 2014 that is exactly</text>
  <text start="20.4" dur="6.69">twelve hundred and ninety days before</text>
  <text start="23.25" dur="5.4">yom teruah peace of Trumpets 2017 and of</text>
  <text start="27.09" dur="3.449">course you read in Daniel chapter 12 of</text>
  <text start="28.65" dur="5.64">this abomination of desolation will last</text>
  <text start="30.539" dur="6.18">for 1290 days I will put links below</text>
  <text start="34.29" dur="4.65">this video to that article to show that</text>
  <text start="36.719" dur="4.261">but in any case I was looking at</text>
  <text start="38.94" dur="4.439">Stellarium and I found something very</text>
  <text start="40.98" dur="6.39">very interesting that happens between</text>
  <text start="43.379" dur="5.191">the new moon of the 12th month the 12th</text>
  <text start="47.37" dur="3.509">year month for those following the</text>
  <text start="48.57" dur="5.16">correct scriptural calendar and the</text>
  <text start="50.879" dur="5.761">abomination of desolation the new moon</text>
  <text start="53.73" dur="4.469">occurs the evening of March 1st to the</text>
  <text start="56.64" dur="4.079">evening of March 2nd that&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="58.199" dur="5.21">the 12th new moon or the final month of</text>
  <text start="60.719" dur="7.561">the Hebrew year and then of course</text>
  <text start="63.409" dur="6.341">approximately nine days later we come to</text>
  <text start="68.28" dur="5.519">the abomination of desolation on March</text>
  <text start="69.75" dur="7.229">11th now here we are we&amp;#39;re looking from</text>
  <text start="73.799" dur="5.101">Israel and we see that the Sun right</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="3.841">here this is now the evening of March</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="3.57">1st so it&amp;#39;s just the beginning at 6</text>
  <text start="80.82" dur="3.99">o&amp;#39;clock in the evening March 1st the</text>
  <text start="82.47" dur="4.92">beginning of the new moon we see that</text>
  <text start="84.81" dur="5.82">the Sun is right here in the symbol of</text>
  <text start="87.39" dur="4.74">Aquarius which is basically the man with</text>
  <text start="90.63" dur="3.15">the water pitcher pouring out his water</text>
  <text start="92.13" dur="5.129">so this is the new moon the 12th new</text>
  <text start="93.78" dur="5.64">moon and as we go from the new moon to</text>
  <text start="97.259" dur="7.101">March 11th we just see that that Sun</text>
  <text start="99.42" dur="4.94">sort of shoots out from the water</text>
  <text start="105.79" dur="3.9">and by the abomination of desolation</text>
  <text start="107.32" dur="6.62">that&amp;#39;s headed toward the the fish over</text>
  <text start="109.69" dur="8.25">here but that&amp;#39;s what we see between</text>
  <text start="113.94" dur="5.98">between the new moon and the abomination</text>
  <text start="117.94" dur="7.71">of desolation is that sun shooting out</text>
  <text start="119.92" dur="7.11">from the water now</text>
  <text start="125.65" dur="3.57">what&amp;#39;s interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="127.03" dur="4.14">whenever y&amp;#39;all communicate something in</text>
  <text start="129.22" dur="3.96">the heavens he&amp;#39;s communicating something</text>
  <text start="131.17" dur="4.02">both positive there&amp;#39;s a positive</text>
  <text start="133.18" dur="4.56">interpretation and then there&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="135.19" dur="4.59">negative interpretation there&amp;#39;s the the</text>
  <text start="137.74" dur="3.18">interpretation for the saints for those</text>
  <text start="139.78" dur="3.3">who have pure hearts and then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="140.92" dur="4.2">the interpretation for everyone else the</text>
  <text start="143.08" dur="5.85">the wicked those who are not pressing</text>
  <text start="145.12" dur="6.48">into yah and I&amp;#39;m gonna first explore the</text>
  <text start="148.93" dur="4.29">positive interpretation and that is this</text>
  <text start="151.6" dur="3.36">this man right here with the water</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="4.2">pitcher there&amp;#39;s actually a scripture</text>
  <text start="154.96" dur="5.61">tied to this is in mark chapter 14 and</text>
  <text start="157.42" dur="5.58">in mark chapter 14 starting in verse 12</text>
  <text start="160.57" dur="5.04">this is right before the Feast of</text>
  <text start="163" dur="5.1">Unleavened 11 the feast of unleavened</text>
  <text start="165.61" dur="5.7">bread begins right before Passover</text>
  <text start="168.1" dur="4.95">begins and it says it was almost the</text>
  <text start="171.31" dur="3.54">first day of unleavened bread or when</text>
  <text start="173.05" dur="3.75">they would kill the Passover his</text>
  <text start="174.85" dur="4.02">disciples said unto joshua where will</text>
  <text start="176.8" dur="4.92">you that we go and prepare that we may</text>
  <text start="178.87" dur="4.53">eat the Passover and Yahshua sent forth</text>
  <text start="181.72" dur="4.47">two of his disciples and said go you</text>
  <text start="183.4" dur="6.57">into the city and there shall you meet a</text>
  <text start="186.19" dur="6.72">man bearing a pitcher of water again the</text>
  <text start="189.97" dur="4.32">this sign in the sky here is a man with</text>
  <text start="192.91" dur="4.53">a pitcher of water and he&amp;#39;s pouring out</text>
  <text start="194.29" dur="4.8">the water and we&amp;#39;re wheresoever he shall</text>
  <text start="197.44" dur="3.51">go in say you to the Goodman of the</text>
  <text start="199.09" dur="3.42">house the master says where&amp;#39;s the guest</text>
  <text start="200.95" dur="3.69">chamber where I shall eat the Passover</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="4.229">with my disciples and he will show you a</text>
  <text start="204.64" dur="4.74">large upper room furnished and prepared</text>
  <text start="206.739" dur="4.561">there make ready for us and his</text>
  <text start="209.38" dur="4.44">disciples went forth and came into the</text>
  <text start="211.3" dur="5.58">city and found just as Yahshua said unto</text>
  <text start="213.82" dur="5.01">them and they made ready the Passover so</text>
  <text start="216.88" dur="3.9">the disciples found this man bearing</text>
  <text start="218.83" dur="4.29">this pitcher of water and it actually</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="5.64">this man led them to where they were to</text>
  <text start="223.12" dur="5.43">eat that Passover dinner the very night</text>
  <text start="226.42" dur="6.21">that Yahshua was to be crucified so it</text>
  <text start="228.55" dur="6.57">was a way that the disciples were able</text>
  <text start="232.63" dur="5.34">to find the exact location Yasha wanted</text>
  <text start="235.12" dur="3.93">them to go for Passover now again if you</text>
  <text start="237.97" dur="2.28">look at the timeline you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="239.05" dur="4.38">that Passover this year should be</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="4.83">occurring in a safe place because those</text>
  <text start="243.43" dur="3">who are pressing into yeah those who</text>
  <text start="245.08" dur="2.73">love Him with all the heart soul mind</text>
  <text start="246.43" dur="3.81">and strength they&amp;#39;re gonna be spending</text>
  <text start="247.81" dur="6.14">those 1260 days in the safe place from</text>
  <text start="250.24" dur="6.51">April 10th 2014 until September 21st</text>
  <text start="253.95" dur="5.71">2017 how do we get to the safe place</text>
  <text start="256.75" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s up to you it&amp;#39;s Yasu per natural</text>
  <text start="259.66" dur="3.9">power I believe it&amp;#39;s gonna be through a</text>
  <text start="260.89" dur="4.68">spiritual supernatural whirlwind like</text>
  <text start="263.56" dur="3.54">you did with Phillip in Acts chapter 8</text>
  <text start="265.57" dur="5.22">where Philip was evangelizing and</text>
  <text start="267.1" dur="5.34">preaching and yaa caught Philip up in by</text>
  <text start="270.79" dur="3.9">the Holy Spirit and supernaturally</text>
  <text start="272.44" dur="3.51">transported into another town hundreds</text>
  <text start="274.69" dur="2.04">and hundreds of miles away and I believe</text>
  <text start="275.95" dur="2.64">that&amp;#39;s the same thing that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="276.73" dur="4.38">happen to those of us who are pressing</text>
  <text start="278.59" dur="5.22">into him and are crying out Luke 21:36</text>
  <text start="281.11" dur="6.12">to be to be saved from all these things</text>
  <text start="283.81" dur="5.37">to come to pass but what&amp;#39;s amazing about</text>
  <text start="287.23" dur="3.78">the son being in the water pitcher and</text>
  <text start="289.18" dur="3.51">then traveling out shooting out from the</text>
  <text start="291.01" dur="3.87">water picture it&amp;#39;s like Yas</text>
  <text start="292.69" dur="4.43">communicating and saying hey this</text>
  <text start="294.88" dur="4.59">Passover which will be in April I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="297.12" dur="4.33">showing a sign in the heavens that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="299.47" dur="4.17">preparing a place for you I&amp;#39;m preparing</text>
  <text start="301.45" dur="7.17">the Passover I&amp;#39;m preparing a place to</text>
  <text start="303.64" dur="9.06">take you even even as globally</text>
  <text start="308.62" dur="5.61">you know Yas sanctuary and his spirit is</text>
  <text start="312.7" dur="4.02">gonna be trampled underfoot by the</text>
  <text start="314.23" dur="4.5">Antichrist the the abomination of</text>
  <text start="316.72" dur="6.15">desolation just like Yasha was crucified</text>
  <text start="318.73" dur="6.36">2,000 years ago he&amp;#39;s preparing a place a</text>
  <text start="322.87" dur="4.83">safe place for his people just like he</text>
  <text start="325.09" dur="4.02">used the water pitcher man the man who</text>
  <text start="327.7" dur="3.78">bore the water pitcher to guide the</text>
  <text start="329.11" dur="5.25">disciples to the exact location where to</text>
  <text start="331.48" dur="4.74">keep this Passover that very night so</text>
  <text start="334.36" dur="4.89">there&amp;#39;s the there&amp;#39;s the positive picture</text>
  <text start="336.22" dur="6.51">now the negative picture would be that</text>
  <text start="339.25" dur="6.24">as we see again the Sun is here in this</text>
  <text start="342.73" dur="5.49">water being poured out and as we get</text>
  <text start="345.49" dur="4.89">toward the abomination of desolation on</text>
  <text start="348.22" dur="5.58">the 11th it just shoots out and heads</text>
  <text start="350.38" dur="6.21">toward the fish what we see here is that</text>
  <text start="353.8" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s going to be a satanic anointing</text>
  <text start="356.59" dur="5.73">okay just as there was anointing on</text>
  <text start="359.05" dur="5.25">Pentecost or the the fire the water the</text>
  <text start="362.32" dur="3.87">spirit was poured out upon the disciples</text>
  <text start="364.3" dur="3.96">so - there&amp;#39;s going to be a satanic</text>
  <text start="366.19" dur="3.82">anointing leading up to the days the</text>
  <text start="368.26" dur="4.96">abomination of desolation</text>
  <text start="370.01" dur="5.61">and it&amp;#39;s heading toward the fish which</text>
  <text start="373.22" dur="6.42">represents a counterfeit fish a</text>
  <text start="375.62" dur="5.82">counterfeit fish too you know the</text>
  <text start="379.64" dur="3.57">Antichrist is going to be given a bunch</text>
  <text start="381.44" dur="4.44">of fish just like Joshua was given a</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="3.9">bunch of fish so the Antichrist will as</text>
  <text start="385.88" dur="2.97">well and there&amp;#39;s going to be a false</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="5.04">satanic anointing that&amp;#39;s going to pour</text>
  <text start="388.85" dur="7.32">out from the abomination of desolation</text>
  <text start="392.15" dur="5.49">and spread out across the earth and and</text>
  <text start="396.17" dur="3.36">this counterfeit anointing is going to</text>
  <text start="397.64" dur="3.48">mesmerize anyone who does not have a</text>
  <text start="399.53" dur="5">love for the truth and cause them to</text>
  <text start="401.12" dur="3.41">start worshiping the Beast</text>
  <text start="404.59" dur="3.67">the other interesting thing that I just</text>
  <text start="406.67" dur="5.82">noticed as I was playing around the</text>
  <text start="408.26" dur="6.03">stellarium is you notice the moon is</text>
  <text start="412.49" dur="4.74">right here the moon is always symbolic</text>
  <text start="414.29" dur="6.15">of the bride this is on March 1st but as</text>
  <text start="417.23" dur="5.37">the Sun shoots out the moon as you can</text>
  <text start="420.44" dur="4.95">see it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s leaving it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="422.6" dur="5.55">away so that&amp;#39;s another picture of the</text>
  <text start="425.39" dur="4.41">bride sort of fleeing to the safe place</text>
  <text start="428.15" dur="4.2">or heading to the safe place or being</text>
  <text start="429.8" dur="3.99">removed taken out of the way as this</text>
  <text start="432.35" dur="5.91">false anointing starts pouring out</text>
  <text start="433.79" dur="6.3">across the earth so there&amp;#39;s both a</text>
  <text start="438.26" dur="3.99">positive and negative interpretation I</text>
  <text start="440.09" dur="5.19">think again this confirms what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="442.25" dur="4.95">to be happening on March 11th 2014 and</text>
  <text start="445.28" dur="4.29">even in the days prior to that from the</text>
  <text start="447.2" dur="4.8">new moon to March 11th you see that this</text>
  <text start="449.57" dur="4.47">false anointing will be spreading out</text>
  <text start="452" dur="4.26">pouring out as the Sun shoots out from</text>
  <text start="454.04" dur="5.19">the water being poured from the symbol</text>
  <text start="456.26" dur="5.73">of the of the man pouring out the water</text>
  <text start="459.23" dur="4.26">also you know the the pagans even though</text>
  <text start="461.99" dur="2.13">this is not what yah calls that star</text>
  <text start="463.49" dur="2.87">formation</text>
  <text start="464.12" dur="5.16">the pagans call that star formation</text>
  <text start="466.36" dur="4.69">Aquarius and you&amp;#39;ve always heard about</text>
  <text start="469.28" dur="3.9">the New Agers waiting for the Age of</text>
  <text start="471.05" dur="4.71">Aquarius well it&amp;#39;s very interesting that</text>
  <text start="473.18" dur="4.83">that Sun is basically lighting up this</text>
  <text start="475.76" dur="4.17">Age of Aquarius this is false anointing</text>
  <text start="478.01" dur="5.13">in the days leading up to the</text>
  <text start="479.93" dur="5.43">abomination of desolation so what does</text>
  <text start="483.14" dur="4.62">this mean this means that we&amp;#39;ve gotta</text>
  <text start="485.36" dur="3.3">press into Yahshua we&amp;#39;ve got to love him</text>
  <text start="487.76" dur="2.43">with all our heart soul mind and</text>
  <text start="488.66" dur="3.42">strength love our brothers and sisters</text>
