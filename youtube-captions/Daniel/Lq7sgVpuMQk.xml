  <text start="0.77" dur="7">Shalom Shalom Shalom it is the second</text>
  <text start="4.23" dur="7.67">day of the week July the 6th 2015 the</text>
  <text start="7.77" dur="7.289">20th day of the 4th Hebrew month and</text>
  <text start="11.9" dur="5.17">wanted to make a new video about this</text>
  <text start="15.059" dur="4.941">brand new timeline that I&amp;#39;ve just posted</text>
  <text start="17.07" dur="5.699">on the website I will put a link to this</text>
  <text start="20" dur="5.65">to this timeline that&amp;#39;s on my website</text>
  <text start="22.769" dur="5.821">underneath this video this timeline</text>
  <text start="25.65" dur="5.16">complements the Daniels 70 weeks</text>
  <text start="28.59" dur="5.16">timeline that I have and in this</text>
  <text start="30.81" dur="5.79">timeline I go from all the way from Adam</text>
  <text start="33.75" dur="5.87">stration all the way down through until</text>
  <text start="36.6" dur="6.11">the 70th week being fulfilled of 2020 ad</text>
  <text start="39.62" dur="6.22">before I start this there&amp;#39;s three</text>
  <text start="42.71" dur="4.509">scriptural principles that have to be</text>
  <text start="45.84" dur="3.6">observed whenever you&amp;#39;re gonna make a</text>
  <text start="47.219" dur="5.25">timeline into the Bible first of all</text>
  <text start="49.44" dur="7.259">from the time that Jacob enters into</text>
  <text start="52.469" dur="7.201">Egypt there has to be exactly 430 years</text>
  <text start="56.699" dur="6.421">from that time until the Exodus and</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s recorded in Exodus chapter 12 so</text>
  <text start="63.12" dur="4.44">that principle has to be kept in any</text>
  <text start="64.89" dur="5.85">timeline that you create the second</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="3.989">principle is that from the time of the</text>
  <text start="70.74" dur="3.84">Exodus</text>
  <text start="71.549" dur="4.651">until the fourth year of King Solomon&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="74.58" dur="5.52">reign when he starts construction on the</text>
  <text start="76.2" dur="6.48">temple there has to be 480 years between</text>
  <text start="80.1" dur="4.32">those two dates and then the third and</text>
  <text start="82.68" dur="4.56">final principle which is not known by</text>
  <text start="84.42" dur="4.57">many there&amp;#39;s a obscure verse in I</text>
  <text start="87.24" dur="3.92">believe it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="88.99" dur="4.75">first Tings are actually might be in</text>
  <text start="91.16" dur="5.91">judges that there is actually a period</text>
  <text start="93.74" dur="5.34">of 300 years between the time of Joshua</text>
  <text start="97.07" dur="5.48">and the children of Israel entering the</text>
  <text start="99.08" dur="7.01">promised land and the reign of Japheth</text>
  <text start="102.55" dur="6.25">so if those three principles can be</text>
  <text start="106.09" dur="5.47">maintained then you know you have a</text>
  <text start="108.8" dur="5.91">solid timeline that accurately reflects</text>
  <text start="111.56" dur="6.03">the time spans the record in the Bible</text>
  <text start="114.71" dur="6.12">but if any if your timeline violates any</text>
  <text start="117.59" dur="5.43">of those three scriptures which are set</text>
  <text start="120.83" dur="4.53">in stone then you know your timeline has</text>
  <text start="123.02" dur="5.189">some problems so this timeline that I</text>
  <text start="125.36" dur="4.02">have here it actually does abide by all</text>
  <text start="128.209" dur="2.641">three of those scriptures and I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="129.38" dur="2.64">to show that as you go through this</text>
  <text start="130.85" dur="3.99">timeline and I&amp;#39;m really excited about</text>
  <text start="132.02" dur="4.32">this timeline this maps out well you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="134.84" dur="4.08">see what it maps out but it maps out all</text>
  <text start="136.34" dur="4.41">the judges all the kings connects it all</text>
  <text start="138.92" dur="5.34">the way down through the timeline I</text>
  <text start="140.75" dur="7.26">already have up for Daniel 70 weeks okay</text>
  <text start="144.26" dur="5.97">so this is the full timeline here full</text>
  <text start="148.01" dur="6.449">timeline from creation until 2020 ad</text>
  <text start="150.23" dur="6.42">when Daniels 70th week is fulfilled so</text>
  <text start="154.459" dur="7.801">here we go so four thousand one BC we</text>
  <text start="156.65" dur="7.589">have Adam being created and then 1656</text>
  <text start="162.26" dur="4.41">years later which is you can easily find</text>
  <text start="164.239" dur="5.311">this time out just by adding up all the</text>
  <text start="166.67" dur="5.73">years of the you know Adam through Noah</text>
  <text start="169.55" dur="7.59">when they are born when they die and you</text>
  <text start="172.4" dur="6.63">come to the year 2345 BC the flood then</text>
  <text start="177.14" dur="6.24">we come to Abraham&amp;#39;s birth right here in</text>
  <text start="179.03" dur="7.2">21 63 BC and then 75 years later when</text>
  <text start="183.38" dur="5.73">he&amp;#39;s 75 years old Abraham begins his</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="4.41">sojourn west as y&amp;#39;all leads him toward</text>
  <text start="189.11" dur="5.849">Canaan to</text>
  <text start="190.64" dur="9.42">the future Israel then when Abraham is</text>
  <text start="194.959" dur="8.61">99 years old in 2064 Isaac is born when</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="5.25">Isaac is 40 Jacob is born and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.569" dur="4.14">really cool about this timeline as you</text>
  <text start="205.31" dur="5.01">see that you know Jacob was able to meet</text>
  <text start="207.709" dur="4.201">his grandfather Abraham so I think</text>
  <text start="210.32" dur="6.18">that&amp;#39;s really neat</text>
  <text start="211.91" dur="7.26">so anyway Abraham dies and then Jacob</text>
  <text start="216.5" dur="5.34">here in 1894 BC this is a key date right</text>
  <text start="219.17" dur="4.95">here this is one Jacob&amp;#39;s 130 years old</text>
  <text start="221.84" dur="5.1">according to Genesis and this is when</text>
  <text start="224.12" dur="4.38">according to Exodus 12 that the 430</text>
  <text start="226.94" dur="2.97">years sojourn of the children of Israel</text>
  <text start="228.5" dur="4.5">began needed remember Abraham got a</text>
  <text start="229.91" dur="6.29">dream about this when when yah made a</text>
  <text start="233" dur="5.1">covenant with Abraham way back in here</text>
  <text start="236.2" dur="3.46">Abraham was shown that the children of</text>
  <text start="238.1" dur="3.9">Israel would be down in Egypt for about</text>
  <text start="239.66" dur="4.65">four hundred years but it will be</text>
  <text start="242" dur="5.67">exactly 430 years from this date when</text>
  <text start="244.31" dur="6.42">Jacob comes down into Egypt and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.67" dur="6.33">1894 and as you can see in this timeline</text>
  <text start="250.73" dur="5.55">the exodus is 1464 so there&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="254" dur="5.489">from 8 to 94 to 46 before there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.28" dur="7.17">exactly 430 years so the sunlight</text>
  <text start="259.489" dur="7.141">maintains that that scripture then Isaac</text>
  <text start="263.45" dur="5.7">dies just right here and the Jacob dies</text>
  <text start="266.63" dur="3.93">just shortly after Isaac Isaac out of</text>
  <text start="269.15" dur="3.51">all the three patriarchs lives the</text>
  <text start="270.56" dur="5.19">longest which I thought was interesting</text>
  <text start="272.66" dur="7.319">Jacob lives the shortest then after</text>
  <text start="275.75" dur="7.979">Jacob dies you have about a time span of</text>
  <text start="279.979" dur="5.21">about 300 years here and then Moses is</text>
  <text start="283.729" dur="2.93">born</text>
  <text start="285.189" dur="5.431">and then of course you have the Exodus</text>
  <text start="286.659" dur="5.31">right here in 1464 and then about 38</text>
  <text start="290.62" dur="2.97">years later after they wandered the</text>
  <text start="291.969" dur="4.561">wilderness the spies are sent out and</text>
  <text start="293.59" dur="4.829">give the favourable report and then two</text>
  <text start="296.53" dur="3.389">years more so 40 years in wilderness</text>
  <text start="298.419" dur="3.421">this is when they enter the Promised</text>
  <text start="299.919" dur="3.9">Land of course this is when Moses dies</text>
  <text start="301.84" dur="3.139">and they enter the Promised Land</text>
  <text start="303.819" dur="5.4">then there are seven years of conquest</text>
  <text start="304.979" dur="7.09">till fourteen seventeen BC and then here</text>
  <text start="309.219" dur="4.38">I sort of just guess - the Joshua diet</text>
  <text start="312.069" dur="3.391">we don&amp;#39;t know this but Joshua I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="313.599" dur="3.75">guessing ruled for twenty years and</text>
  <text start="315.46" dur="3.87">actually that guess I think proves to be</text>
  <text start="317.349" dur="4.701">right because the rest of the timeline</text>
  <text start="319.33" dur="5.309">seems to fit perfectly with the judges a</text>
  <text start="322.05" dur="5.649">lot of people now get confused with the</text>
  <text start="324.639" dur="4.981">time of the judges because in first</text>
  <text start="327.699" dur="3.301">Kings the book of first kings when you</text>
  <text start="329.62" dur="2.699">get to the fourth year of Solomon&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331" dur="3.419">reign when he begins construction of the</text>
  <text start="332.319" dur="4.71">temple it says there&amp;#39;s been four hundred</text>
  <text start="334.419" dur="4.65">eighty years from that point back toward</text>
  <text start="337.029" dur="4.23">the time of the exodus well when you add</text>
  <text start="339.069" dur="4.081">up all the different judges and then the</text>
  <text start="341.259" dur="4.111">times between the judges when Israel&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.15" dur="3.72">oppressed by your enemies you come up to</text>
  <text start="345.37" dur="3.509">weigh more than four hundred eighty</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="5.07">years between the Exodus and Solomon&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="348.879" dur="4.44">fourth year however what you showed me</text>
  <text start="351.94" dur="4.08">and as I started piecing together</text>
  <text start="353.319" dur="4.111">scriptures is that many of the judges Co</text>
  <text start="356.02" dur="3.269">reigned with each other and this</text>
  <text start="357.43" dur="4.829">principle of different judges and King&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="359.289" dur="4.44">Co reigning with each other happens as</text>
  <text start="362.259" dur="2.731">late as the Roman Empire so it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="363.729" dur="4.351">principle that&amp;#39;s very important</text>
  <text start="364.99" dur="4.59">understand the Scriptures aren&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="368.08" dur="3.059">don&amp;#39;t come out and say it but you can</text>
  <text start="369.58" dur="3.239">kind of piece it together and infer it</text>
  <text start="371.139" dur="4.321">from different scriptures so I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="372.819" dur="4.681">I&amp;#39;m gonna go through this now so Joshua</text>
  <text start="375.46" dur="3.81">dies and for channel 4 is my best guest</text>
  <text start="377.5" dur="3.719">and then you have eight years according</text>
  <text start="379.27" dur="3.929">to the scriptures where Israelite so</text>
  <text start="381.219" dur="4.681">impressed by Kushan for eight years and</text>
  <text start="383.199" dur="4.74">then the first judge after judge after</text>
  <text start="385.9" dur="4.859">Joshua comes on the scene off kneel and</text>
  <text start="387.939" dur="4.95">he kills Kushan drives back Israel&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.759" dur="6.27">enemies and he rules Israel for forty</text>
  <text start="392.889" dur="6.3">years then you have Eglon who&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="397.029" dur="3.971">enemy and he oppresses Israel for</text>
  <text start="399.189" dur="4.271">another eighteen years</text>
  <text start="401" dur="5.7">then a hoot who takes the dagger and</text>
  <text start="403.46" dur="6.54">stabs that one he delivers Israel and</text>
  <text start="406.7" dur="6.54">rules Israel for 80 years that takes us</text>
  <text start="410" dur="6.12">to 1258 BC where Jabin the Canaanite</text>
  <text start="413.24" dur="5.58">oppresses Israel for 20 years and then</text>
  <text start="416.12" dur="5.85">we have Deborah and barrack and she</text>
  <text start="418.82" dur="5.79">rules for 40 years as a judge from 12 38</text>
  <text start="421.97" dur="4.77">BC to 1198 BC then you have the</text>
  <text start="424.61" dur="4.59">Midianites who oppress Israel for seven</text>
  <text start="426.74" dur="5.67">years and then you come to Gideon Gideon</text>
  <text start="429.2" dur="6.719">who rules for 40 years from 1191 BC to</text>
  <text start="432.41" dur="5.31">1151 BC but of course you&amp;#39;ll remember</text>
  <text start="435.919" dur="4.371">the Scriptures of Gideon was kind of</text>
  <text start="437.72" dur="5.37">reluctant just going to scroll down here</text>
  <text start="440.29" dur="4.57">Gideon was kind of reluctant to to rule</text>
  <text start="443.09" dur="5.01">and so what that happened was is when</text>
  <text start="444.86" dur="5.64">Gideon died an evil person named and</text>
  <text start="448.1" dur="5.22">mamela kind of took over as a judge and</text>
  <text start="450.5" dur="7.23">he was there for three years and as a</text>
  <text start="453.32" dur="5.94">consequence of that the Philippines</text>
  <text start="457.73" dur="4.98">seems we get into trouble Israel for the</text>
  <text start="459.26" dur="5.24">next 18 years and so it&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="462.71" dur="4.8">River that that period of 18 years</text>
  <text start="464.5" dur="6.34">happens Coe currently with different</text>
  <text start="467.51" dur="6.6">judge&amp;#39;s ruling then tolet rules for 23</text>
  <text start="470.84" dur="5.55">years during tolas rule the Philistines</text>
  <text start="474.11" dur="5.73">are finally crushed and then here in</text>
  <text start="476.39" dur="5.67">1120 8 BC you have Eli ruling from</text>
  <text start="479.84" dur="3.9">Shiloh and he actually Co rules with</text>
  <text start="482.06" dur="5.7">other judges in fact there&amp;#39;s as many as</text>
  <text start="483.74" dur="5.88">two other judges ruling Israel while Eli</text>
  <text start="487.76" dur="3.75">is ruling from Shiloh and the reason why</text>
  <text start="489.62" dur="3.75">I think that this is a very clear</text>
  <text start="491.51" dur="3.93">scriptural is that Eli is looked at as a</text>
  <text start="493.37" dur="3.27">very weak person remember and his two</text>
  <text start="495.44" dur="3.75">sons were very wicked they were</text>
  <text start="496.64" dur="5.1">fornicating with women at the tabernacle</text>
  <text start="499.19" dur="5.07">and they were taking the the sacrifices</text>
  <text start="501.74" dur="4.14">and polluting them and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="504.26" dur="4.02">did not like Eli they looked at them</text>
  <text start="505.88" dur="5.01">very unfavorably because of the way he</text>
  <text start="508.28" dur="4.559">let his son sort of run things and you</text>
  <text start="510.89" dur="4.56">know yah tried to correct Eli and you</text>
  <text start="512.839" dur="5.221">refused that correction from Samuels</text>
  <text start="515.45" dur="4.17">dream so Eli</text>
  <text start="518.06" dur="4.26">is ruling here but but because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="519.62" dur="6.99">looked at as so weak other rulers also</text>
  <text start="522.32" dur="8.52">Co rule with him and so Tola eventually</text>
  <text start="526.61" dur="6.27">dies and then you have Jair rules for</text>
  <text start="530.84" dur="5.4">the next 20 years and there any gyres</text>
  <text start="532.88" dur="4.86">rule you have Jeff F who Co rules will</text>
  <text start="536.24" dur="4.289">drive for next year is six years now</text>
  <text start="537.74" dur="9.5">notice Jeff AB starts an 1124 BC that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.529" dur="10.441">exactly 1124 is exactly 300 years from</text>
  <text start="547.24" dur="5.289">1424 okay remember the scripture says in</text>
  <text start="550.97" dur="3.809">the book of Judges that there&amp;#39;s 300</text>
  <text start="552.529" dur="4.831">years between the entering into the</text>
  <text start="554.779" dur="6.111">Promised Land to win Japheth rules so</text>
  <text start="557.36" dur="5.61">that harmonizes that scripture perfectly</text>
  <text start="560.89" dur="4.6">so that&amp;#39;s the third principle that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.97" dur="4.98">fulfilled there so Jeff Affco rules with</text>
  <text start="565.49" dur="4.77">Jair while Eli is also ruling from</text>
  <text start="567.95" dur="3.99">Shiloh for the next six years so you</text>
  <text start="570.26" dur="4.59">literally have three judges ruling at</text>
  <text start="571.94" dur="4.04">once now you may say well Daniel I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="574.85" dur="3.72">see anywhere in scripture where it says</text>
  <text start="575.98" dur="5.26">that three judges are ruling at once and</text>
  <text start="578.57" dur="3.98">now it doesn&amp;#39;t say explicitly but you</text>
  <text start="581.24" dur="6">have to kind of read between the lines</text>
  <text start="582.55" dur="6.72">and then Japheth dies here and a nib</text>
  <text start="587.24" dur="4.8">zonko rules with Geyer for seven years</text>
  <text start="589.27" dur="4.569">and then right here in 1113 we see</text>
  <text start="592.04" dur="3.6">Philistine the Philistines once again</text>
  <text start="593.839" dur="5.161">begin oppressing Israel for the next</text>
  <text start="595.64" dur="5.6">forty years probably do that you know</text>
  <text start="599" dur="4.64">Eli&amp;#39;s wickedness and and</text>
  <text start="601.24" dur="4.92">you know just the general sin every man</text>
  <text start="603.64" dur="4.14">doing his own thing if Jean dies and</text>
  <text start="606.16" dur="3.78">Ellen then Co rules with Jerry for eight</text>
  <text start="607.78" dur="3.72">years until then Jair finally dies a</text>
  <text start="609.94" dur="5.31">nylon rules for another two years</text>
  <text start="611.5" dur="5.94">Alan dies and then you got apt on ruling</text>
  <text start="615.25" dur="3.54">and then after abdon rules for just a</text>
  <text start="617.44" dur="6.06">few years you have Samson</text>

  <text start="623.5" dur="3.72">finally dies he breaks his neck the</text>
  <text start="625.33" dur="4.98">Philistines captured the arc and the arc</text>

  <text start="630.31" dur="6.08">this is the twenty year of lamenting and</text>
  <text start="632.23" dur="7.26">Samuel begins to rule because Samson is</text>
  <text start="636.39" dur="4.3">enticed and slayed with his own lusts so</text>
  <text start="639.49" dur="2.91">that&amp;#39;s why I think Samuel takes the</text>
  <text start="640.69" dur="6.63">reins even though Samson still</text>
  <text start="642.4" dur="7.86">technically a judge and then 20 years</text>
  <text start="647.32" dur="5.94">after Samson begins his rulership he</text>
  <text start="650.26" dur="4.32">dies here but also takes down the</text>
  <text start="653.26" dur="3.69">Philistines with them you remember that</text>
  <text start="654.58" dur="4.59">story and so that a Philistine 40-year</text>
  <text start="656.95" dur="4.02">oppression and Samson dies here and then</text>
  <text start="659.17" dur="4.08">disappears later Samson is now ruled</text>
  <text start="660.97" dur="4.71">excuse me Samuels down rule 20 years and</text>
  <text start="663.25" dur="3.84">five years after Samson dies of the</text>
  <text start="665.68" dur="3.18">people demand a king to rule over them</text>
  <text start="667.09" dur="2.97">so the people are just fed up they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="668.86" dur="3.33">had all these different judge&amp;#39;s ruling</text>
  <text start="670.06" dur="3.93">them some of them at the same time Eli</text>
  <text start="672.19" dur="3.66">was a big disappointment Samson was a</text>
  <text start="673.99" dur="6.24">big disappointment and they&amp;#39;re just fed</text>
  <text start="675.85" dur="6.39">up and so and also say Samuels own sons</text>
  <text start="680.23" dur="5.55">were starting to behave very much like</text>
  <text start="682.24" dur="5.13">Eli son so they wanted a king so then we</text>
  <text start="685.78" dur="4.92">have the claim of the Kings that begin</text>
  <text start="687.37" dur="7.38">in 1068 BC so King Saul ruled for 40</text>
  <text start="690.7" dur="7.89">years from 1068 to 1020 a PC and then</text>
  <text start="694.75" dur="6.57">King David ruled from 1028 to 988 BC and</text>
  <text start="698.59" dur="5.49">then solomon ruled from 9 88 to 94 t 8</text>
  <text start="701.32" dur="6.42">now this is perfect because four years</text>
  <text start="704.08" dur="5.4">into solomon&amp;#39;s reign is 984 and of</text>
  <text start="707.74" dur="5.22">course it&amp;#39;s exactly four hundred eighty</text>
  <text start="709.48" dur="6.27">years from 984 all the way back to 464</text>
  <text start="712.96" dur="4.73">when the exodus began so again this</text>
  <text start="715.75" dur="4.58">timeline adheres to that</text>
  <text start="717.69" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;s talked about in first Kings and</text>
  <text start="720.33" dur="3.63">also what&amp;#39;s interesting as 984 would be</text>
  <text start="723.18" dur="3.17">a Jubilee year</text>
  <text start="723.96" dur="6.93">Jubilee years happen every 50 years</text>
  <text start="726.35" dur="7.21">after one AD they happened on every</text>
  <text start="730.89" dur="4.56">seventeen and sixty 77267</text>
  <text start="733.56" dur="3.27">before ad that happened on every eighty</text>
  <text start="735.45" dur="3.93">four and thirty four eighty four and</text>
  <text start="736.83" dur="4.68">thirty for every fifty years so 984</text>
  <text start="739.38" dur="4.2">would have been a Jubilee which i think</text>
  <text start="741.51" dur="5.46">is a very significant because that is</text>
  <text start="743.58" dur="4.92">the year when solid begins destruction</text>
  <text start="746.97" dur="2.94">on the temple up until this point</text>
  <text start="748.5" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re only been a Tabernacle in Shiloh</text>
  <text start="749.91" dur="3.27">and then it was moved to Jerusalem by</text>
  <text start="751.98" dur="3.27">David but it only been a tenth</text>
  <text start="753.18" dur="3.6">Tabernacle now we&amp;#39;re gonna have a temple</text>
  <text start="755.25" dur="3.84">and I think it&amp;#39;s very fitting that that</text>
  <text start="756.78" dur="4.2">temple construction begins this is</text>
  <text start="759.09" dur="5.13">mentioned in first Kings 6:1 on a</text>
  <text start="760.98" dur="5.55">Jubilee year and of course 984 BC is</text>
  <text start="764.22" dur="4.08">also four hundred and eighty years after</text>
  <text start="766.53" dur="4.62">the Exodus thus the exodus happened in</text>
  <text start="768.3" dur="4.71">464 PC which already went over so again</text>
  <text start="771.15" dur="3.69">you can see that my timeline adheres to</text>
  <text start="773.01" dur="3.27">all three of those scriptures there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="774.84" dur="3">four hundred and thirty years of the</text>
  <text start="776.28" dur="4.86">children of Israel sojourning in Egypt</text>
  <text start="777.84" dur="6.09">from the time Jacob enters in 1884 until</text>
  <text start="781.14" dur="4.2">the exes in 1464 there&amp;#39;s 300 years</text>
  <text start="783.93" dur="3.45">between the time of them entering the</text>
  <text start="785.34" dur="4.26">promised land and Japheth ruling and</text>
  <text start="787.38" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s 480 years from the fourth year</text>
  <text start="789.6" dur="3.18">of Solomon when it begins construction</text>
  <text start="791.1" dur="4.71">on the temple all the way back to the</text>
  <text start="792.78" dur="5.73">Exodus so my timeline fulfills all free</text>
  <text start="795.81" dur="4.26">of those scriptures and whenever you</text>
  <text start="798.51" dur="5.43">look at other timelines you have to make</text>
  <text start="800.07" dur="5.43">sure they adhere to that now after of</text>
  <text start="803.94" dur="3.69">course Solomon there&amp;#39;s the civil war</text>
  <text start="805.5" dur="4.98">Israel splits into the northern kingdoms</text>
  <text start="807.63" dur="5.49">and the southern kingdom of Judah and I</text>
  <text start="810.48" dur="5.4">just followed the Judean kings here we</text>
  <text start="813.12" dur="5.73">have Rehoboam Solomon&amp;#39;s son ranks for 17</text>
  <text start="815.88" dur="4.38">years from 1948 to 931 and then we have</text>
  <text start="818.85" dur="3.44">all these Kings ABBA</text>
  <text start="820.26" dur="4.68">three years asset is 41 years</text>
  <text start="822.29" dur="4.78">Jehoshaphat 25 years Joe horn these this</text>
  <text start="824.94" dur="4.949">could all be verified by Scripture</text>
  <text start="827.07" dur="5.43">ah-hah Xia afonya joash was a very</text>
  <text start="829.889" dur="6.06">righteous King ring for 40 years Amaziah</text>
  <text start="832.5" dur="6.449">Uzziah Jotham Ahaz Hezekiah and then</text>
  <text start="835.949" dur="6.481">look at this Manasseh who&amp;#39;s considered</text>
  <text start="838.949" dur="7.56">the most wicked King the most wicked</text>
  <text start="842.43" dur="7.98">King in scripture of Judah he starts in</text>
  <text start="846.509" dur="5.88">6 6 6 BC isn&amp;#39;t that cool to me that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="850.41" dur="2.729">just confirmation that this timeline is</text>
  <text start="852.389" dur="3.961">correct</text>
  <text start="853.139" dur="5.791">so Manasseh rules from 666 to 611</text>
  <text start="856.35" dur="4.799">666 the number of the beast right there</text>
  <text start="858.93" dur="3.959">imbedded in Vanessa&amp;#39;s ring then you got</text>
  <text start="861.149" dur="4.231">his son Amnon ruling for two years and</text>
  <text start="862.889" dur="5.43">then Josiah who&amp;#39;s the last righteous</text>
  <text start="865.38" dur="8.129">king of Judah he rules for 31 years and</text>
  <text start="868.319" dur="6.301">then what I have is in five and by the</text>
  <text start="873.509" dur="3.961">way this is something I don&amp;#39;t have in</text>
  <text start="874.62" dur="5.94">the timeline but the 18th year of your</text>
  <text start="877.47" dur="4.349">size range is 591 BC this is when they</text>
  <text start="880.56" dur="4.68">discovered the book of the law and keep</text>
  <text start="881.819" dur="6.481">a Passover and it&amp;#39;s a Passover discussed</text>
  <text start="885.24" dur="5.13">at the end of the book of Kings where</text>
  <text start="888.3" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s talked about how it&amp;#39;s like the</text>
  <text start="890.37" dur="4.519">greatest Passover that&amp;#39;s ever been</text>
  <text start="891.63" dur="5.85">celebrated since the time of Joshua and</text>
  <text start="894.889" dur="5.111">that happens in 591 which is interesting</text>
  <text start="897.48" dur="6.299">because seven years later would be a</text>
  <text start="900" dur="6.389">jubilee in in 585 84</text>
  <text start="903.779" dur="5.281">anyway in five eighty two years before</text>
  <text start="906.389" dur="6.06">Josiah is killed by the Egyptian king</text>
  <text start="909.06" dur="5.88">I believe Josiah has a son joking begin</text>
  <text start="912.449" dur="7.051">to ko reign with him because Joey came</text>
  <text start="914.94" dur="6.03">actually reigns for 11 years but you had</text>
  <text start="919.5" dur="2.72">he has two Colerain with Josiah in order</text>
  <text start="920.97" dur="3.14">to get that 11 years to fit</text>
