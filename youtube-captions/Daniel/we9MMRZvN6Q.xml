  <text start="8.34" dur="3.78">difficult one for our family we had</text>
  <text start="10.95" dur="2.849">moved into a very expensive</text>
  <text start="12.12" dur="3.45">three-bedroom apartment which was</text>
  <text start="13.799" dur="4.051">perfect for the family but draining on</text>
  <text start="15.57" dur="3.81">the finances it was the only apartment</text>
  <text start="17.85" dur="3.81">that would give us enough space for our</text>
  <text start="19.38" dur="5.069">family and still allow us to move and on</text>
  <text start="21.66" dur="4.619">and on such a short notice I started</text>
  <text start="24.449" dur="3.541">working sundays and going in very early</text>
  <text start="26.279" dur="4.801">during the rest of the week and yet</text>
  <text start="27.99" dur="4.589">still we were just scraping by on top of</text>

  <text start="32.579" dur="3.66">I was doing every day for the delivery</text>
  <text start="34.079" dur="3.66">job had greatly strained my back to the</text>
  <text start="36.239" dur="3.931">point that it became painful to even</text>
  <text start="37.739" dur="3.931">drive in early August the pain had</text>
  <text start="40.17" dur="3.63">become so bad that I was constantly</text>
  <text start="41.67" dur="3.81">dizzy while in the band and finally I</text>
  <text start="43.8" dur="4.439">had to tell my job that he did some time</text>
  <text start="45.48" dur="4.079">off to figure out what was going on for</text>
  <text start="48.239" dur="3">the next two months I went to a</text>
  <text start="49.559" dur="3.66">chiropractor that was covered by my car</text>
  <text start="51.239" dur="3.721">insurance the pain somewhat diminished</text>
  <text start="53.219" dur="4.32">but I still couldn&amp;#39;t shake the intense</text>
  <text start="54.96" dur="4.71">dizziness that I had it became obvious</text>
  <text start="57.539" dur="4.231">to both onic and myself that I would</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="3.42">need to find another line of work even</text>
