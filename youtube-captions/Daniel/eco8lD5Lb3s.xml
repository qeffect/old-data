  <text start="3.48" dur="5.97">the eleventh Hebrew much februari third</text>
  <text start="6.109" dur="6.61">2014 nightly skype fellowship and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="9.45" dur="5.819">now getting into Hebrews chapter 6 so</text>
  <text start="12.719" dur="5.64">Hebrews five ended off with us you know</text>
  <text start="15.269" dur="7.1">the author rebuking his audience for not</text>
  <text start="18.359" dur="6.361">knowing the the milk of or yeah not not</text>
  <text start="22.369" dur="3.58">being fathers and mothers in the faith</text>
  <text start="24.72" dur="2.399">and being able to eat the meat of the</text>
  <text start="25.949" dur="4.32">word instead they were having to</text>
  <text start="27.119" dur="5.19">basically get the milk of the word which</text>
  <text start="30.269" dur="4.891">again that milk is just the basic</text>
  <text start="32.309" dur="5.131">understanding that Yahshua came as a</text>
  <text start="35.16" dur="3.66">flesh-and-blood man and he went through</text>
  <text start="37.44" dur="3.33">all the trials and tribulations and</text>
  <text start="38.82" dur="3.84">temptations that we go through and yet</text>
  <text start="40.77" dur="5.67">he never sinned and that&amp;#39;s how he&amp;#39;s able</text>
  <text start="42.66" dur="5.82">to give us the power to never sinned you</text>
  <text start="46.44" dur="3.599">know what&amp;#39;s so amazing is that just like</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="3.09">here in the first century now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="50.039" dur="3.45">living in the 21st century where so many</text>
  <text start="51.57" dur="4.35">Christians think it&amp;#39;s preposterous that</text>
  <text start="53.489" dur="4.351">we can live without sin and yet that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="55.92" dur="3.659">basic doctrine that&amp;#39;s a basic</text>
  <text start="57.84" dur="4.08">understanding of fun no effect that we</text>
  <text start="59.579" dur="4.41">can live without sin because the whole</text>
  <text start="61.92" dur="4.41">point of what Yahshua gives us his</text>
  <text start="63.989" dur="6.301">spirit to help us resistant to overcome</text>
  <text start="66.33" dur="6.75">sin to walk in his ways so picking up in</text>
  <text start="70.29" dur="5.119">Hebrews 6 verse 1 therefore leaving the</text>
  <text start="73.08" dur="5.94">principles of the doctrine of Messiah</text>
  <text start="75.409" dur="6.85">let us go on unto perfection not laying</text>
  <text start="79.02" dur="6.66">again the foundation of repentance from</text>
  <text start="82.259" dur="5.521">dead works and a faith toward yah he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="85.68" dur="5.1">about the list again some basic basic</text>
  <text start="87.78" dur="5.58">doctrines first he lists repentance from</text>
  <text start="90.78" dur="4.229">dead works that is you&amp;#39;re no longer</text>
  <text start="93.36" dur="4.11">walking in dead work should no longer</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="6">walking in sin you&amp;#39;re no longer doing</text>
  <text start="97.47" dur="6.39">that which is sin of faith toward yah of</text>
  <text start="101.009" dur="5.461">course those two go hand-in-hand you no</text>
  <text start="103.86" dur="4.619">longer do sin instead you&amp;#39;ve now place</text>
  <text start="106.47" dur="3.6">your complete and total faith and trust</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="4.471">in yo you&amp;#39;ve surrendered your entire</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="4.89">will to yah which means his spirit is</text>
  <text start="112.95" dur="4.379">now enabling you to do not dead works</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="5.67">but works that are life that the works</text>
  <text start="117.329" dur="5.43">of the Torah so those two are very very</text>
  <text start="120.63" dur="4.769">basic and go hand in hand of the</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="4.11">doctrine of baptisms the option of</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="5.491">baptism so we know that there are a</text>
  <text start="126.869" dur="5.7">variety of baptisms or mikvahs the two</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="4.019">most important being the mix</text>
  <text start="132.569" dur="5.67">of repentance which was the mikvah that</text>
  <text start="134.909" dur="6.3">John preached and then the mikvah of the</text>
  <text start="138.239" dur="5.64">of a fire which is what Yahshua taught</text>
  <text start="141.209" dur="4.23">the indwelling of the Holy Spirit both</text>
  <text start="143.879" dur="2.911">of those mikvahs now there&amp;#39;s a variety</text>
  <text start="145.439" dur="2.791">of other Mick foots in the Torah you</text>
  <text start="146.79" dur="3.509">know that for cleanliness and things</text>
  <text start="148.23" dur="4.259">like that but those two mikvahs are the</text>
  <text start="150.299" dur="5.64">most important repentance and the</text>
  <text start="152.489" dur="8.071">baptism of fire laying on of hands</text>
  <text start="155.939" dur="7.2">laying on of hands is simply the Holy</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="4.62">Spirit is imparted by the elders placing</text>
  <text start="163.139" dur="3.57">their hands upon you and praying for the</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="3.709">spirit to fill you they did this to paul</text>
  <text start="166.709" dur="4.65">and barnabas when they sent them out</text>
  <text start="168.889" dur="3.97">they did this in the book of Acts on the</text>
  <text start="171.359" dur="4.141">day of Pentecost they did this in many</text>
  <text start="172.859" dur="5.58">different situations where you lay hands</text>
  <text start="175.5" dur="5.04">on you know those were filled the spirit</text>
  <text start="178.439" dur="3.39">would lay hands on on those who desired</text>
  <text start="180.54" dur="3.69">the spirit and pray that the Spirit</text>
  <text start="181.829" dur="4.77">would fill them Simon the sorcerer was</text>
  <text start="184.23" dur="6.239">trying to get this this ability through</text>
  <text start="186.599" dur="6.78">pain which was wicked but just the basic</text>
  <text start="190.469" dur="5.821">laying on of hands as how the spirit is</text>
  <text start="193.379" dur="5.521">prayed for up for others of the</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="4.289">resurrection of the dead resurrection of</text>
  <text start="198.9" dur="2.91">the dead this is another basic doctor</text>
  <text start="200.579" dur="2.49">that most people don&amp;#39;t understand the</text>
  <text start="201.81" dur="3.389">resurrection of the dead of course there</text>
  <text start="203.069" dur="4.56">being three resurrections there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="205.199" dur="4.801">first fruits which is Yahshua then</text>
  <text start="207.629" dur="4.621">there&amp;#39;s the first resurrection which is</text>
  <text start="210" dur="3.72">all the saints from that have ever lived</text>
  <text start="212.25" dur="4.65">are going to be resurrected on yom</text>
  <text start="213.72" dur="5.28">teruah 2017 and then a thousand years</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="3.539">later there&amp;#39;s the second death which is</text>
  <text start="219" dur="4.079">the resurrection of all the wicked and</text>
  <text start="220.439" dur="5.491">all those who are born and died during</text>
  <text start="223.079" dur="5.91">the 1,000 year reign of Christ and of</text>
  <text start="225.93" dur="4.86">eternal judgment which means that it is</text>
  <text start="228.989" dur="4.321">appointed unto man once to die and then</text>
  <text start="230.79" dur="5.58">the judgment when we either we awaken</text>
  <text start="233.31" dur="4.59">unto eternal righteousness are we awaken</text>
  <text start="236.37" dur="5.009">unto eternal death but whatever it is</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="5.25">once we pass from this life to stand</text>
  <text start="241.379" dur="4.44">before yah whether we&amp;#39;re righteous are</text>
  <text start="243.15" dur="5.84">wicked that judgment is set it is</text>
  <text start="245.819" dur="5.751">eternal it is forever</text>
  <text start="248.99" dur="4.47">now what is amazing is that of these</text>
  <text start="251.57" dur="3.9">doctrines which again are very basic</text>
  <text start="253.46" dur="4.32">understanding of the scripture most</text>
  <text start="255.47" dur="4.2">Christians have no clue and messy annex</text>
  <text start="257.78" dur="3.39">for that matter have no clue what those</text>
  <text start="259.67" dur="3.78">options are about but these are</text>
  <text start="261.17" dur="5.28">according to the author basic basic</text>
  <text start="263.45" dur="7.11">doctrines basic fundamental doctrines to</text>
  <text start="266.45" dur="6.69">the faith and verse 3 and this will we</text>
  <text start="270.56" dur="5.22">do if y&amp;#39;all permit what will we do well</text>
  <text start="273.14" dur="4.14">you started saying saying the thought in</text>
  <text start="275.78" dur="2.94">verse 1 we&amp;#39;re going to move beyond this</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="2.88">we&amp;#39;re going to move beyond these basic</text>
  <text start="278.72" dur="9.15">doctrines we&amp;#39;re going to go on to</text>
  <text start="280.16" dur="10.35">perfection hallelujah number 4 verse 44</text>
  <text start="287.87" dur="5.34">it is impossible for those who are once</text>
  <text start="290.51" dur="5.34">enlightened and have tasted of the</text>
  <text start="293.21" dur="6.3">heavenly gift and were made partakers of</text>
  <text start="295.85" dur="6.6">the ruach ha kodesh and have tasted the</text>
  <text start="299.51" dur="7.11">good word of yah and the powers of the</text>
  <text start="302.45" dur="7.5">world to come if they shall fall away to</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="5.01">renew them again in to repentance seeing</text>
  <text start="309.95" dur="5.9">they crucify to themselves the son of</text>
  <text start="311.63" dur="7.53">y&amp;#39;all fresh and put him to an open shame</text>
  <text start="315.85" dur="6.25">okay so here we&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="319.16" dur="4.83">doctrine of reprobation so those were</text>
  <text start="322.1" dur="4.11">filled always spirit walking in yon</text>
  <text start="323.99" dur="4.26">doing his will if they fall away in</text>
  <text start="326.21" dur="5.7">other words they basically choose to</text>
  <text start="328.25" dur="5.91">turn their back on yon to walk away to</text>
  <text start="331.91" dur="3.66">despise what yah had given them it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="334.16" dur="4.71">impossible to renew them under</text>
  <text start="335.57" dur="6.36">repentance now this is not talking about</text>
  <text start="338.87" dur="4.83">someone who maybe falls into sin or who</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="3.27">becomes you know backslidden for time</text>
  <text start="343.7" dur="2.55">but then comes back to yeah this is</text>
  <text start="345.2" dur="2.58">basically talking about someone who</text>
  <text start="346.25" dur="3.21">basically makes the choice to just</text>
  <text start="347.78" dur="8.25">totally walk away from you and never</text>
  <text start="349.46" dur="9.33">come back again okay and that decision</text>
  <text start="356.03" dur="6.42">made in someone&amp;#39;s heart often it&amp;#39;s hard</text>
  <text start="358.79" dur="7.98">for us to know only yon that person can</text>
  <text start="362.45" dur="6.45">know if that decision is final like for</text>
  <text start="366.77" dur="5.64">instance in Judas Iscariot case his</text>
  <text start="368.9" dur="5.91">decision was final he walked away King</text>
  <text start="372.41" dur="4.41">Saul even though he didn&amp;#39;t die for many</text>
  <text start="374.81" dur="4.29">many many years later his decision when</text>
  <text start="376.82" dur="4.23">he walked away from yah after four years</text>
  <text start="379.1" dur="3.18">of reigning over Israel he began to</text>
  <text start="381.05" dur="3.45">walk away from you how that decision was</text>
  <text start="382.28" dur="3.96">a final decision he made turn away from</text>
  <text start="384.5" dur="3.78">you even though he had prophesied in the</text>
  <text start="386.24" dur="5.209">spirit and devote the spirit so there</text>
  <text start="388.28" dur="8.039">are times and that that that can happen</text>
  <text start="391.449" dur="6.34">and it&amp;#39;s a shame because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="396.319" dur="2.701">doing is they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="397.789" dur="9.06">living a life where they&amp;#39;re crucifying</text>
  <text start="399.02" dur="9.239">Yong making him an open shame this also</text>
  <text start="406.849" dur="3.301">harkens back to what we read about</text>
  <text start="408.259" dur="4.951">earlier in Hebrews where it says you</text>
  <text start="410.15" dur="5.25">know if if even mote the Mosaic law</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="4.679">administered by angels if even that was</text>
  <text start="415.4" dur="4.259">terrifying and had such strength of</text>
  <text start="417.889" dur="4.411">weight behind it if you were to</text>
  <text start="419.659" dur="5.07">transgress it how much more should we</text>
  <text start="422.3" dur="4.5">treat the blood of the Covenant a holy</text>
  <text start="424.729" dur="3.93">thing and not trample it not treated as</text>
  <text start="426.8" dur="4.589">a nun only thing because this is a much</text>
  <text start="428.659" dur="6.81">greater manifestation of fullness of who</text>
  <text start="431.389" dur="6.301">ya is so this does prove that someone</text>
  <text start="435.469" dur="5.311">can be told the Holy Spirit can be</text>
  <text start="437.69" dur="7.259">walking in the Ruach can be filled the</text>
  <text start="440.78" dur="6.449">gifts and yet can turn away that that</text>
  <text start="444.949" dur="4.411">can&amp;#39;t happen because yah does not force</text>
  <text start="447.229" dur="4.351">us to continue on with him and again</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="3.72">this is another reason why even if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="451.58" dur="4.139">filled the spirit even if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="453.08" dur="5.61">operating his gifts we don&amp;#39;t kick back</text>
  <text start="455.719" dur="4.911">and rely on that we press in daily to</text>
  <text start="458.69" dur="4.77">him which has been a theme of Hebrews of</text>
  <text start="460.63" dur="8.14">especially in chapters one two and three</text>
  <text start="463.46" dur="7.47">we were pressing in daily verse 7 for</text>
  <text start="468.77" dur="4.32">the earth with which drinketh in the</text>
  <text start="470.93" dur="4.079">rain that cometh oft upon it and bring</text>
  <text start="473.09" dur="3.87">it forth herbs meat for them by whom and</text>
  <text start="475.009" dur="4.5">his dressed receives blessing from yah</text>
  <text start="476.96" dur="5.97">but that which bears thorns and briers</text>
  <text start="479.509" dur="6.241">is rejected and is 92 cursing who&amp;#39;s n is</text>
  <text start="482.93" dur="6.389">to be burned okay so he&amp;#39;s using a very</text>
  <text start="485.75" dur="5.159">very keen picture here the rain the rain</text>
  <text start="489.319" dur="3.301">comes from having falls on the earth and</text>
  <text start="490.909" dur="4.531">what is what is supposed to come when</text>
  <text start="492.62" dur="5.25">rain falls here is herbs his trees is</text>
  <text start="495.44" dur="4.5">plants is beautiful vegetation but if</text>
  <text start="497.87" dur="3.9">this beautiful rain the blessing of rain</text>
  <text start="499.94" dur="3.719">comes upon the earth and all it comes up</text>
  <text start="501.77" dur="4.92">our thistles and briars and that which</text>
  <text start="503.659" dur="5.341">brings death then it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not fit for</text>
  <text start="506.69" dur="4.08">anything ought to just be burned in the</text>
  <text start="509" dur="4.06">same way if the Holy Spirit is falling</text>
  <text start="510.77" dur="4.36">upon you you want what should</text>
  <text start="513.06" dur="3.75">hopin well the Holy Spirit&amp;#39;s following</text>
  <text start="515.13" dur="3.69">upon you telling you you should then</text>
  <text start="516.81" dur="3.81">respond with a love and adoration toward</text>
  <text start="518.82" dur="3.959">yah toward wanting to pour your life out</text>
  <text start="520.62" dur="5.07">toward yon toward wanting to exalt him</text>
  <text start="522.779" dur="5.221">and glorify him and lift him up but if</text>
  <text start="525.69" dur="4.649">he pours his blessings in a spirit upon</text>
  <text start="528" dur="4.68">you and all you do is give evil works</text>
  <text start="530.339" dur="3.721">back briars and thorns and thistles and</text>
  <text start="532.68" dur="4.29">you don&amp;#39;t groan in but instead you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.06" dur="14.1">actually returning his love with evil</text>
  <text start="536.97" dur="13.08">then you&amp;#39;re fit to be burned verse 9 but</text>
  <text start="548.16" dur="3.78">beloved we are persuaded better things</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="5.49">of you and things that accompany</text>
  <text start="551.94" dur="5.58">salvation though we thus speak so he the</text>
  <text start="555.54" dur="3.6">author gives that some encouraging word</text>
  <text start="557.52" dur="4.05">he&amp;#39;s been rebuking them ever since verse</text>
  <text start="559.14" dur="3.78">5 about being these babes that are just</text>
  <text start="561.57" dur="3.3">on the milk and then he goes even bother</text>
  <text start="562.92" dur="5.4">by basically giving a very fearful</text>
  <text start="564.87" dur="5.7">dissertation of saying hey you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="568.32" dur="4.35">possible for you to be pulled the spirit</text>
  <text start="570.57" dur="3.63">to fall away and to bring forth briars</text>
  <text start="572.67" dur="5.28">when y&amp;#39;all was blessing you but</text>
  <text start="574.2" dur="5.61">nevertheless we think we&amp;#39;re convinced it</text>
  <text start="577.95" dur="4.38">that you&amp;#39;re not going to fall in that</text>
  <text start="579.81" dur="5.37">direction and we believe that you are</text>
  <text start="582.33" dur="5.79">going to show and prove the things that</text>
  <text start="585.18" dur="4.59">accompany salvation he&amp;#39;s warning them</text>
  <text start="588.12" dur="3.36">he&amp;#39;s if you will I guess sort of</text>
  <text start="589.77" dur="4.2">threatening them but but he&amp;#39;s warning</text>
  <text start="591.48" dur="4.26">he&amp;#39;s giving a strong warning a strong</text>
  <text start="593.97" dur="4.56">warning and you know so many people in</text>
  <text start="595.74" dur="5.52">our culture they think oh you know it we</text>
  <text start="598.53" dur="4.559">just need to hear edifying or nice word</text>
  <text start="601.26" dur="3.78">from ministers and pastors well know</text>
  <text start="603.089" dur="4.231">sometimes we need to hear words of</text>
  <text start="605.04" dur="5.34">saying you know what we better press in</text>
