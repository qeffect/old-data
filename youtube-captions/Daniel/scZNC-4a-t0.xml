  <text start="17.1" dur="6.24">episode 32 Hebrews eight what is a</text>
  <text start="20.55" dur="3.899">covenant something that&amp;#39;s very important</text>
  <text start="23.34" dur="3.29">to understand and I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="24.449" dur="5.16">people misunderstand what a covenant is</text>
  <text start="26.63" dur="5.559">and this causes a lot of people to</text>
  <text start="29.609" dur="3.961">misunderstand what our obligation is</text>
  <text start="32.189" dur="3.87">toward the Covenant when they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="33.57" dur="3.69">understand what a covenant is so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="36.059" dur="3">going to turn to Hebrews eight where it</text>
  <text start="37.26" dur="5.25">actually talks about the first covenant</text>
  <text start="39.059" dur="7.111">and the renewed covenant which we are</text>
  <text start="42.51" dur="5.7">under now and the entire chapter is very</text>
  <text start="46.17" dur="6.36">good I encourage you to read at all but</text>
  <text start="48.21" dur="6.57">we&amp;#39;re going to start in verse 7 4 if</text>
  <text start="52.53" dur="3.84">that first covenant so we&amp;#39;re referring</text>
  <text start="54.78" dur="3.72">to the covenant that was given on Mount</text>
  <text start="56.37" dur="4.2">Sinai tomb O&amp;#39;Shea and the children of</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="3.899">Israel for that first covenant had been</text>
  <text start="60.57" dur="4.169">faultless then should know place had</text>
  <text start="62.399" dur="6.421">been sought for the second for finding</text>
  <text start="64.739" dur="5.67">fault with them he saith behold the</text>
  <text start="68.82" dur="3.6">day&amp;#39;s come saith Yahweh that i will make</text>
  <text start="70.409" dur="4.861">a renewed covenant with the house of</text>
  <text start="72.42" dur="4.379">Israel and with the house of Yehuda not</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="3.18">according to the covenant that I made</text>
  <text start="76.799" dur="3.36">with their fathers in the day when I</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="4.11">took them by the hand to lead them out</text>
  <text start="80.159" dur="5.761">of the land of Egypt because they</text>
  <text start="82.56" dur="7.169">continued not in my covenant and I</text>
  <text start="85.92" dur="5.339">regarded them not say if Yahweh for this</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="3">is the Covenant that I will make with</text>
  <text start="91.259" dur="4.441">the house of Israel after those days</text>
  <text start="92.729" dur="5.46">saith Yahweh I will put my Torah into</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="4.11">their mind and write my laws into their</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="5.25">hearts and I will be to them an Elohim</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="8.839">and they shall be to me a people verse</text>
  <text start="103.439" dur="7.411">10 so we we find here some very</text>
  <text start="108.649" dur="4.211">incredible statements and one of the</text>
  <text start="110.85" dur="6">ones i want to point out to begin here</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="7.17">is the reason the first covenant was</text>
  <text start="116.85" dur="6.42">done away with and why place was found</text>
  <text start="120.03" dur="4.799">for a second is because first of all in</text>
  <text start="123.27" dur="4.769">verse 8 he says he found fault with them</text>
  <text start="124.829" dur="5.85">that would be the children of israel and</text>
  <text start="128.039" dur="4.381">then he goes on to say in verse 9 they</text>
  <text start="130.679" dur="3.811">continue not in my covenant</text>
  <text start="132.42" dur="3.57">so he found fault with them they</text>
  <text start="134.49" dur="3.3">continue not in the Covenant so because</text>
  <text start="135.99" dur="4.02">of this because he found follow them</text>
  <text start="137.79" dur="4.05">because by and large the children of</text>
  <text start="140.01" dur="4.71">Israel did not continue in the Covenant</text>
  <text start="141.84" dur="7.35">he had to create a new and better</text>
  <text start="144.72" dur="6.87">covenant one in which hopefully the</text>
  <text start="149.19" dur="5.76">other party his people would actually</text>
  <text start="151.59" dur="5.01">walk in the Covenant and this new</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="4.14">covenant this renewed covenant which is</text>
  <text start="156.6" dur="5.219">what was ratified by the by the spilling</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="4.83">of blood from Yahshua is what was</text>
  <text start="161.819" dur="6.361">prophesied in Ezekiel chapter 11 when he</text>
  <text start="163.92" dur="6.09">said I will put my spirits into the</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="5.4">hearts of my people and my spirit will</text>
  <text start="170.01" dur="7.89">cause them to walk in my statutes in my</text>
  <text start="173.58" dur="9.96">Commandments in my judgments and this is</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="8.43">why in verse 10 the renewed covenant the</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="5.16">second and better covenant why is it</text>
  <text start="186.33" dur="4.29">better because because the people his</text>
  <text start="188.7" dur="5.81">people actually walk in it unlike in the</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="7.56">first covenant they did not it says I</text>
  <text start="194.51" dur="4.9">will put my Torah into their mind and</text>
  <text start="198.18" dur="3.21">write them in their hearts just like</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="3.9">Ezekiel 11 prophesied I will put my</text>
  <text start="201.39" dur="3.39">spirit into them and it will cause them</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="6.75">to walk in my statutes and in my</text>
  <text start="204.78" dur="7.65">judgments and in my precepts okay so we</text>
  <text start="210.06" dur="5.1">hear the error amongst Christianity</text>
  <text start="212.43" dur="4.11">today that the Torah has been done away</text>
  <text start="215.16" dur="2.91">with it has been nailed to the cross it</text>
  <text start="216.54" dur="4.47">is no longer a part of the Covenant but</text>
  <text start="218.07" dur="7.05">that is not what this is saying what is</text>
  <text start="221.01" dur="5.61">a covenant a covenant is often I hear a</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="3.149">lot of people misunderstand and say that</text>
  <text start="226.62" dur="4.2">the Covenant is the Torah no that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="228.269" dur="5.94">that&amp;#39;s the tour is not a covenant the</text>
  <text start="230.82" dur="5.4">Torah given to Moses the laws of</text>
  <text start="234.209" dur="3.991">Commandments given in the Torah the</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="5.7">first five books of the Bible is one</text>
  <text start="238.2" dur="5.94">component of a covenant if we look at</text>
  <text start="241.92" dur="4.64">the first covenant there are three</text>
  <text start="244.14" dur="5.999">distinct components there is Yahweh</text>
  <text start="246.56" dur="5.769">there are the people of Israel with whom</text>
  <text start="250.139" dur="4.171">Yahweh&amp;#39;s entering into the covenant and</text>
  <text start="252.329" dur="3.601">there is the Torah these are the</text>
  <text start="254.31" dur="4.709">commandments and the precepts and the</text>
  <text start="255.93" dur="6.059">the statutes that Yahweh&amp;#39;s asking these</text>
  <text start="259.019" dur="4.89">people to walk in if the people fulfill</text>
  <text start="261.989" dur="3.911">their end of the the covenant and they</text>
  <text start="263.909" dur="3.341">walk on these statutes then you</text>
  <text start="265.9" dur="4.2">&amp;#39;we will fulfill his end of the Covenant</text>
  <text start="267.25" dur="4.949">and protect and bless his people so the</text>
  <text start="270.1" dur="4.289">Covenant is formed of three different</text>
  <text start="272.199" dur="4.831">components the two parties that are</text>
  <text start="274.389" dur="4.741">entering into an agreement and then the</text>
  <text start="277.03" dur="4.77">commandments the statues and laws by</text>
  <text start="279.13" dur="4.92">which the two parties will agree that</text>
  <text start="281.8" dur="4.26">they will walk in so we have Yahweh</text>
  <text start="284.05" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s component one we have the people</text>
  <text start="286.06" dur="5.4">of Israel that&amp;#39;s component two and we</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="5.459">have the agreement or the laws that</text>
  <text start="291.46" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re going to enter into by covenant</text>
  <text start="293.259" dur="4.47">and that is the Torah now when we look</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="4.71">at the renewed covenant that is</text>
  <text start="297.729" dur="4.341">established in the renewed Testament in</text>
  <text start="300.52" dur="4.17">the New Testament in the Brit hadashah</text>
  <text start="302.07" dur="4.659">which is ratified by the spilling of the</text>
  <text start="304.69" dur="5.099">blood of Yahshua HaMashiach by Jesus the</text>
  <text start="306.729" dur="6.451">Christ we discovered that the Torah is</text>
  <text start="309.789" dur="6.63">still an active component in the New</text>
  <text start="313.18" dur="6.39">Covenant in the renewed covenant we</text>
  <text start="316.419" dur="4.5">still have Yahweh he is a party in the</text>
  <text start="319.57" dur="3.51">New Covenant just as he was in the first</text>
  <text start="320.919" dur="4.111">covenant we still have the Torah the</text>
  <text start="323.08" dur="4.25">Torah are still the laws and</text>
  <text start="325.03" dur="5.28">Commandments and statutes and precepts</text>
  <text start="327.33" dur="5.26">by which Yahweh will enter into this</text>
  <text start="330.31" dur="4.62">covenant with the second party and who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.59" dur="4.68">anybody again the second party is Israel</text>
  <text start="334.93" dur="5.669">and Judah it&amp;#39;s his people however this</text>
  <text start="337.27" dur="4.889">time this time Israel and Judah will</text>
  <text start="340.599" dur="3.091">walk in these presets because they will</text>
  <text start="342.159" dur="4.561">be filled with the gift of the ruach ha</text>
  <text start="343.69" dur="4.62">kodesh the Holy Spirit which as Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="346.72" dur="5.25">11 prophesied as was prophesied in</text>
  <text start="348.31" dur="5.639">Jeremiah 31 this spirit will cause them</text>
  <text start="351.97" dur="6.54">to walk in his precepts and statutes and</text>
  <text start="353.949" dur="6.481">judgments out of a love for him so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.51" dur="3.87">amazing the similarities between the</text>
  <text start="360.43" dur="3.66">first covenant and the renewed cabinet</text>
  <text start="362.38" dur="3.539">Christian&amp;#39;s try to say that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="364.09" dur="3.93">big difference that things have been</text>
  <text start="365.919" dur="3.81">done away with that that there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="368.02" dur="3.81">now difference between what we see in</text>
  <text start="369.729" dur="3.961">the new and versus the old but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="371.83" dur="4.68">not what Hebrews 8 is saying at all if</text>
  <text start="373.69" dur="5.28">anything we see remarkable similarities</text>
  <text start="376.51" dur="4.379">the only difference between the two</text>
  <text start="378.97" dur="3.6">covenants is number one in the New</text>
  <text start="380.889" dur="2.821">Covenant we now have yahshua&amp;#39;s blood we</text>
  <text start="382.57" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t just have the blood of bulls and</text>
  <text start="383.71" dur="4.139">goats looking forward to the Messiah&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.26" dur="4.32">sacrifice but we have yahshua&amp;#39;s blood</text>
  <text start="387.849" dur="3.841">that ratifies this covenant and we</text>
  <text start="390.58" dur="3.269">understand that Bloods a necessary</text>
  <text start="391.69" dur="5.43">component because even in Mount Sinai</text>
  <text start="393.849" dur="5.261">Moshe took the blood of the animals and</text>
  <text start="397.12" dur="4.57">he sprinkled the book of the Covenant</text>
  <text start="399.11" dur="3.84">the people and himself in the same way</text>
  <text start="401.69" dur="5.91">we have the blood of Yahshua that</text>
  <text start="402.95" dur="7.32">sprinkles us and delivers us but we have</text>
  <text start="407.6" dur="4.47">Yahweh in both covenants we have as</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="5.88">people Israel and Judah in both</text>
  <text start="412.07" dur="6.36">covenants and we have the Torah in both</text>
  <text start="416.15" dur="4.23">covenants we have all three of the same</text>
  <text start="418.43" dur="4.11">components in both of the cabinet&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="420.38" dur="3.87">difference is that the blood of yash was</text>
  <text start="422.54" dur="3.48">in the in the renewed covenant which is</text>
  <text start="424.25" dur="6.48">why it&amp;#39;s better it&amp;#39;s built on better</text>
  <text start="426.02" dur="8.07">promises and the Holy Spirit is given in</text>
  <text start="430.73" dur="6.03">mass to to his people whereas in the</text>
  <text start="434.09" dur="4.41">Tanakh you saw here and there people who</text>
  <text start="436.76" dur="3.27">walked in the spirit such as ma che such</text>
  <text start="438.5" dur="4.14">as David such as your host show son of</text>
  <text start="440.03" dur="4.14">nun but by and large most it were not</text>
  <text start="442.64" dur="4.5">build the spirit and did not continue in</text>
  <text start="444.17" dur="4.23">the Covenant such as those who wandered</text>
  <text start="447.14" dur="3.75">in the wilderness for forty years they</text>
  <text start="448.4" dur="4.74">did not have the Spirit like their</text>
  <text start="450.89" dur="4.53">children would have would have after</text>
  <text start="453.14" dur="4.59">them and so they fell in the desert they</text>
  <text start="455.42" dur="6.51">displeased Yahweh they did not mix the</text>
  <text start="457.73" dur="6.03">hearing of the word with faith so so</text>
  <text start="461.93" dur="4.41">these this new covent has better</text>
  <text start="463.76" dur="4.08">promises and has a better result because</text>
  <text start="466.34" dur="3.96">as people are filled with the spirit</text>
  <text start="467.84" dur="5.37">they do mix the truth that they here</text>
  <text start="470.3" dur="5.88">with faith and thus it produces fruit in</text>
  <text start="473.21" dur="4.5">their lives so really when you examine</text>
  <text start="476.18" dur="4.23">the wording of Hebrews chapter 8 there</text>
  <text start="477.71" dur="5.04">is not a huge difference in terms of the</text>
  <text start="480.41" dur="4.11">components that that form the covenant</text>
  <text start="482.75" dur="4.92">between the first and the second</text>
  <text start="484.52" dur="5.28">covenants the components really are the</text>
  <text start="487.67" dur="4.02">same you still have the same two parties</text>
  <text start="489.8" dur="3.9">you still have Yahweh and Israel and</text>
  <text start="491.69" dur="4.77">Judah just as you had on Mount Sinai you</text>
  <text start="493.7" dur="5.04">still have the Torah and it says this I</text>
  <text start="496.46" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t know how Christians can can can</text>
  <text start="498.74" dur="4.59">overlook this but it&amp;#39;s so clear in verse</text>
  <text start="500.78" dur="4.26">10 it says that this new covenant that i</text>
  <text start="503.33" dur="3.84">will make with the house of Israel after</text>
  <text start="505.04" dur="4.62">those days since Yahweh I will put my</text>
  <text start="507.17" dur="5.52">Torah or if you have a king james bible</text>
  <text start="509.66" dur="5.58">i will put my laws into their mind and</text>
  <text start="512.69" dur="4.44">write them in their hearts so whereas</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="4.65">before the torah was inscribed on</text>
  <text start="517.13" dur="4.26">tablets of stone now he says i&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="519.89" dur="2.97">to describe them in their minds and</text>
  <text start="521.39" dur="4.83">hearts and this is also predicted in</text>
  <text start="522.86" dur="6.12">ezekiel 11 that he will give them hearts</text>
  <text start="526.22" dur="4.41">of flesh I won&amp;#39;t describe his</text>
  <text start="528.98" dur="2.83">commandments app on their tablets of</text>
  <text start="530.63" dur="3.56">flesh</text>
  <text start="531.81" dur="3.76">this was all prophesied the Tanakh it</text>
  <text start="534.19" dur="4.47">all comes to pass in the renewed</text>
  <text start="535.57" dur="6.24">covenant and it it is it boggles the</text>
  <text start="538.66" dur="5.31">mind that Christians can read Hebrews 8</text>
  <text start="541.81" dur="4.14">and say the tour has been done away with</text>
  <text start="543.97" dur="6.989">when it very specifically says in verse</text>
  <text start="545.95" dur="8.1">10 Hebrews 810 that he will write the</text>
  <text start="550.959" dur="6.151">Torah into their minds and into their</text>
  <text start="554.05" dur="4.83">hearts the tour is not done away with if</text>
  <text start="557.11" dur="2.97">anything the tour is made more essential</text>
  <text start="558.88" dur="3.95">and more important because it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="560.08" dur="5.25">longer just put on on tablets of stone</text>
  <text start="562.83" dur="6.24">it&amp;#39;s written on our very hearts and our</text>
  <text start="565.33" dur="6.629">minds it is an essential part of the</text>
  <text start="569.07" dur="6.36">essential component of the Covenant that</text>
  <text start="571.959" dur="6.031">we enter into with Yahshua the King</text>
  <text start="575.43" dur="5.71">because he&amp;#39;s ratified this with his</text>
  <text start="577.99" dur="6.599">blood and dare we trample on this</text>
  <text start="581.14" dur="5.04">covenant no we don&amp;#39;t so let us walk on</text>
  <text start="584.589" dur="3.291">the tour I let us walk in the region</text>
  <text start="586.18" dur="4.05">covenant ratified by his blood</text>
  <text start="587.88" dur="4.6">fulfilling the prophecy in Ezekiel that</text>
