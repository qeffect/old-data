  <text start="166.76" dur="4.71">can&amp;#39;t heal on the Sabbath well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.01" dur="4.56">ridiculous nowhere in the Torah does it</text>
  <text start="171.47" dur="3.69">prohibit you from healing on the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="173.57" dur="4.08">day that&amp;#39;s a good thing and you should</text>

  <text start="177.65" dur="4.98">stupid but Yahshua came to show the true</text>
  <text start="180.17" dur="3.9">meaning of the Sabbath natebain and also</text>
  <text start="182.63" dur="6.17">the true meaning of all the commands</text>
  <text start="184.07" dur="10.86">this is why he says in Matthew chapter 5</text>
  <text start="188.8" dur="7.93">he says verse 15 17 think not that I</text>
  <text start="194.93" dur="4.05">come to destroy the Torah and the</text>
  <text start="196.73" dur="3.81">prophets when I save the Torah I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="198.98" dur="4.65">referring to what the Christians call</text>
  <text start="200.54" dur="5.16">the Old Testament law he says don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="203.63" dur="3.93">let it enter into your mind but I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="205.7" dur="4.5">come to destroy the tour in the prophets</text>
  <text start="207.56" dur="6.66">no no no no I have not come to destroy</text>
  <text start="210.2" dur="5.85">but to fill up to revive I&amp;#39;ve come to</text>
  <text start="214.22" dur="3.57">obey them all to teach you how to obey</text>
  <text start="216.05" dur="5.61">them all because by the first century</text>
  <text start="217.79" dur="6.36">the rabbis had forgotten about love and</text>
  <text start="221.66" dur="5.72">love was at the heart of the Jewish</text>
  <text start="224.15" dur="5.43">Torah when it was first given to Moses</text>
  <text start="227.38" dur="4.27">several thousand years earlier Mount</text>
  <text start="229.58" dur="4.59">Sinai but the Jews of the first century</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="4.74">had completely forgotten about love and</text>
  <text start="234.17" dur="5.55">so now Jesus is going to show how to</text>
  <text start="236.39" dur="5.1">properly obey the Torah this is why</text>
  <text start="239.72" dur="4.2">Jesus war disease eat according to</text>
  <text start="241.49" dur="4.35">Torres covered his head he wore clothing</text>
  <text start="243.92" dur="4.68">lummox fiber he kept the dietary laws</text>
  <text start="245.84" dur="4.59">but he also preached love God loved her</text>
  <text start="248.6" dur="4.11">neighbor now stuck commit adultery he</text>
  <text start="250.43" dur="4.71">kept the entire Torah as it should have</text>
  <text start="252.71" dur="4.37">been bent and if we want to be priced</text>
  <text start="255.14" dur="4.65">like we&amp;#39;re going to do the same thing</text>
  <text start="257.08" dur="4.75">many says for verily I say unto you</text>
  <text start="259.79" dur="5.52">until the heavens and the earth pass</text>
  <text start="261.83" dur="5.61">away not one jot or one tittle from the</text>
  <text start="265.31" dur="5.13">tour of Moses will pass away is what</text>
  <text start="267.44" dur="5.13">Jesus said so that means you know</text>
  <text start="270.44" dur="4.2">wearing this easy that&amp;#39;s a minor law in</text>
  <text start="272.57" dur="3.84">the Old Testament you know cover you as</text>
  <text start="274.64" dur="3.57">a minor law thou shalt not commit</text>
  <text start="276.41" dur="3.81">adultery is a major law keeping the</text>
  <text start="278.21" dur="4.71">Sabbath some major law keeping the feast</text>
  <text start="280.22" dur="5.25">days jesus said look as long as</text>
  <text start="282.92" dur="5.25">see the sky above you and your believe</text>
  <text start="285.47" dur="5.88">you got one jot or tittle from this loss</text>
  <text start="288.17" dur="5.64">is over so why are the Christians not</text>
  <text start="291.35" dur="4.8">keeping the entire law why they say the</text>
  <text start="293.81" dur="4.47">way to the thrust makes no sense it can</text>
  <text start="296.15" dur="4.89">actually pose what Jesus Christ actually</text>
  <text start="298.28" dur="5.88">talked he said whosoever shall break one</text>
  <text start="301.04" dur="5.82">of these please come in and shall teach</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="4.83">men so he shall be called the lease or</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="5.43">be known as trash or dung in my kingdom</text>
  <text start="308.99" dur="4.59">but whosoever shall do and teach even</text>
  <text start="312.29" dur="5.88">the smallest commandments of the Torah</text>
  <text start="313.58" dur="6.65">shall be called great so Jesus tells us</text>
  <text start="318.17" dur="5.43">how you and I can be greatness Kingdom</text>
  <text start="320.23" dur="5.17">we get washed from our sins by his blood</text>
