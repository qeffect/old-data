  <text start="4.41" dur="5.79">15th 2017 it&amp;#39;s also the fourth day of</text>
  <text start="7.74" dur="5.729">unleavened bread it&amp;#39;s Passover week</text>
  <text start="10.2" dur="6.499">unfolds I&amp;#39;m now creating my second part</text>
  <text start="13.469" dur="5.97">of the set the 17 part series exploring</text>
  <text start="16.699" dur="5.711">the teachings of Messiah and Apostle</text>
  <text start="19.439" dur="4.291">Paul and reconciling their teachings the</text>
  <text start="22.41" dur="2.43">first part of course was the</text>
  <text start="23.73" dur="2.4">introduction about the three main</text>
  <text start="24.84" dur="2.46">principles which are three main</text>
  <text start="26.13" dur="3.479">principles that we&amp;#39;re going to keep in</text>
  <text start="27.3" dur="3.93">mind as we go through this series the</text>
  <text start="29.609" dur="5.22">second part is going to be on Acts</text>
  <text start="31.23" dur="6.21">chapter 15 which is known as the</text>
  <text start="34.829" dur="5.131">Jerusalem Council now this is a very</text>
  <text start="37.44" dur="4.23">important passage because oftentimes</text>
  <text start="39.96" dur="3.599">Christians will read this and even</text>
  <text start="41.67" dur="3.54">Messianics will read this and say ah</text>
  <text start="43.559" dur="4.02">look look we don&amp;#39;t need to keep the</text>
  <text start="45.21" dur="5.16">Torah circumcision is bad all these</text>
  <text start="47.579" dur="4.8">things and this just comes from a very</text>
  <text start="50.37" dur="5.73">poor understanding and sometimes a bad</text>
  <text start="52.379" dur="4.921">translation of the passage itself so</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="3.479">let&amp;#39;s just start from the beginning</text>
  <text start="57.3" dur="4.11">it says in certain men which came down</text>
  <text start="59.579" dur="4.14">from Judea taught the bread brethren and</text>
  <text start="61.41" dur="5.51">it said except she be circumcised after</text>
  <text start="63.719" dur="7.171">the manner of Moses you cannot be saved</text>
  <text start="66.92" dur="5.8">okay so there&amp;#39;s two problems here one is</text>
  <text start="70.89" dur="4.14">you need to ask yourself the question</text>
  <text start="72.72" dur="5.67">did circumcision come from Moses or from</text>
  <text start="75.03" dur="4.35">Abraham and then the second one is you</text>
  <text start="78.39" dur="5.1">cannot be saved</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="7.26">okay so salvation of course is</text>
  <text start="83.49" dur="4.86">completely dependent upon us repenting</text>
  <text start="86.64" dur="4.17">of our sin and being washed in the blood</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="4.71">of Messiah his spirit filling us and</text>
  <text start="90.81" dur="4.559">then he leads us into all opt-ins</text>
  <text start="93.06" dur="3.54">okay that that is what salvation is all</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="3.991">about</text>
  <text start="96.6" dur="6.449">and of course we&amp;#39;re supposed to continue</text>
  <text start="99.36" dur="6">to obey continue to grow in his word but</text>
  <text start="103.049" dur="3.631">none of those things Waring is easy</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="2.91">getting circumcised those things don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="106.68" dur="5.219">those don&amp;#39;t save us okay that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="5.01">symptom it&amp;#39;s a wearing the Zizi nor</text>
  <text start="111.899" dur="5.07">keeping Shabbat and getting circumcised</text>
  <text start="113.28" dur="7.83">these are all results of being converted</text>
  <text start="116.969" dur="5.341">of falling in love with Yahshua but the</text>
  <text start="121.11" dur="3.119">major problem is is that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="122.31" dur="4.559">even talking about the circumcision of</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="5.071">Abraham okay yeah commanded Abraham way</text>
  <text start="126.869" dur="3.181">back in Genesis to have his foreskin</text>
  <text start="129.3" dur="3.06">removed and then</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="5.04">Kommandant parents whenever they have a</text>
  <text start="132.36" dur="5.19">male child to circumcise him at the age</text>
  <text start="135.09" dur="5.88">of eight this was a commandment that was</text>
  <text start="137.55" dur="8.22">given to anyone who would follow him</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="6.57">yeah but the circumcision of Moses is</text>
  <text start="145.77" dur="4.41">something completely different this is a</text>
  <text start="147.54" dur="5.57">colloquialism that was used in the first</text>
  <text start="150.18" dur="5.91">century and it was a cloak Lee as</text>
  <text start="153.11" dur="6.13">colloquialism used to describe this</text>
  <text start="156.09" dur="6.12">rabbinic Talmudic oral tradition that</text>
  <text start="159.24" dur="5.04">you had to follow in order to become a</text>
  <text start="162.21" dur="5.82">quote/unquote Pharisee or sagusti or an</text>
  <text start="164.28" dur="6.18">accepted Jew and these involved a lot of</text>
  <text start="168.03" dur="5.49">traditions of men that had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="170.46" dur="4.83">with the Torah a better translation</text>
  <text start="173.52" dur="4.35">would actually be after the manner of</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="5.28">Moses or after the the circumcision</text>
  <text start="177.87" dur="4.47">believed to have come from Moses this</text>
  <text start="180.57" dur="4.98">isn&amp;#39;t anything Moses taught of course</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="7.47">again this was a first century Talmudic</text>
  <text start="185.55" dur="6.27">oral tradition commandments of men that</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="3.84">was known as the circumcision of Moses</text>
  <text start="191.82" dur="3.81">had nothing to do with the actual</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="3.51">commandment that was not even given to</text>
  <text start="195.63" dur="3.42">Moses it was given to Abraham if they</text>
  <text start="197.16" dur="4.079">were really talking about removing the</text>
  <text start="199.05" dur="3.09">foreskin on the eighth day of a baby&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="201.239" dur="2.671">life if they&amp;#39;re really talking about</text>
  <text start="202.14" dur="3.72">that they refer to it as the</text>
  <text start="203.91" dur="3.9">circumcision of Abraham because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="205.86" dur="4.379">that&amp;#39;s to whom that command was given</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="5.64">and then by through him it was given to</text>
  <text start="210.239" dur="4.831">all of us so this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="4.1">that so that&amp;#39;s something to make clear</text>
  <text start="215.07" dur="5.76">from the very very beginning number 2</text>
  <text start="217.55" dur="5.98">verse 2 when therefore Paul and Barnabas</text>
  <text start="220.83" dur="4.77">had no small dissension of disputation</text>
  <text start="223.53" dur="3.84">with them they determined that paul and</text>
  <text start="225.6" dur="4.02">barnabas and certain other of them</text>
  <text start="227.37" dur="3.839">should go up to Jerusalem under the</text>
  <text start="229.62" dur="5.61">apostles and elders about this question</text>
  <text start="231.209" dur="6.121">and being brought on their way by the</text>
  <text start="235.23" dur="4.62">Assembly they passed through penis and</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="5.46">Samaria declaring the conversion of the</text>
  <text start="239.85" dur="5.58">Gentiles and they caused great joy unto</text>
  <text start="242.79" dur="4.77">all the brethren now again this</text>
  <text start="245.43" dur="4.17">shouldn&amp;#39;t you know the fact that</text>
  <text start="247.56" dur="4.44">Gentiles could be converted and built</text>
  <text start="249.6" dur="4.59">the spirit and become part of Israel a</text>
  <text start="252" dur="4.739">part of those who would serve Yahshua it</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="4.049">shouldn&amp;#39;t have been a huge shock but</text>
  <text start="256.739" dur="3.901">because again we&amp;#39;re in the 1st century</text>
  <text start="258.239" dur="2.72">and they had been loads and loads all</text>
  <text start="260.64" dur="3.499">this</text>
  <text start="260.959" dur="5.761">modak oral traditions they thought oh</text>
  <text start="264.139" dur="4.53">wow you know can Gentiles really become</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="3.69">part of us and so it was it was a huge</text>
  <text start="268.669" dur="3.421">shock when it was even to Peter it was a</text>
  <text start="270.41" dur="4.61">huge shock and we&amp;#39;ll talk about that</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="6.24">next part when we go to Acts chapter 10</text>
  <text start="275.02" dur="4.48">but it shouldn&amp;#39;t have been a shot</text>
  <text start="278.33" dur="3.239">because in Torah</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="4.259">in fact we&amp;#39;ll just pick out a scripture</text>
  <text start="281.569" dur="3.931">here in Exodus chapter 12 this is</text>
  <text start="283.759" dur="4.951">specifically referring to the Passover</text>
  <text start="285.5" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s probably appropriate since this is</text>
  <text start="288.71" dur="4.32">the feast of Passover</text>
  <text start="290.9" dur="5.07">it says when it&amp;#39;s talking about keeping</text>
  <text start="293.03" dur="5.58">the Passover says in exodus 12 verse 48</text>
  <text start="295.97" dur="4.5">and when a stranger or a Gentile shall</text>
  <text start="298.61" dur="3.75">sojourn with thee and will keep the</text>
  <text start="300.47" dur="3.66">Passover to Yahweh let all his males be</text>
  <text start="302.36" dur="4.77">circumcised and then let him come near</text>
  <text start="304.13" dur="4.83">and keep it and yea he shall be as one</text>
  <text start="307.13" dur="4.259">that is born inland he shall become an</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="4.739">Israelite basically for no uncircumcised</text>
  <text start="311.389" dur="4.321">Persians shall eat thereof one Torah</text>
  <text start="313.699" dur="4.201">shall be to him that his home borne and</text>
  <text start="315.71" dur="4.56">unto the stranger to the Gentile that</text>
  <text start="317.9" dur="4.44">sojourn is among you so write their tour</text>
  <text start="320.27" dur="4.619">provides a revision for a stranger</text>
  <text start="322.34" dur="4.02">Gentile to become part of Israel and we</text>
  <text start="324.889" dur="3.421">see this all through this now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="6.63">specifically referring to Passover but</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="7.949">we see this with with ruth the moabite</text>
  <text start="332.99" dur="4.35">asst okay she wanted to join unto yah or</text>
  <text start="336.259" dur="3.541">she didn&amp;#39;t have to be circumcised she</text>
  <text start="337.34" dur="4.44">was a woman but she decided to cleave</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="5.549">unto the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob</text>
  <text start="341.78" dur="8.28">and she became an Israelite okay she was</text>
  <text start="345.349" dur="9.06">no longer considered a Moabite us so and</text>
  <text start="350.06" dur="7.289">then we have also the the prostitute</text>
  <text start="354.409" dur="6.75">Rahab the prostitute in the in the city</text>
  <text start="357.349" dur="5.641">of Jericho where she through her faith</text>
  <text start="361.159" dur="3.211">she decided to cleave her she and her</text>
  <text start="362.99" dur="5.31">family decided to cleave on the yacht</text>
  <text start="364.37" dur="7.56">and she became an Israelite as well so</text>
  <text start="368.3" dur="6.239">this is not something that should have</text>
  <text start="371.93" dur="5.519">been foreign to the first century Jews</text>
  <text start="374.539" dur="7.141">because Torah does allow Gentiles to</text>
  <text start="377.449" dur="7.02">become part of Israel and but because of</text>
  <text start="381.68" dur="5.22">all the man-made traditions that it</text>
  <text start="384.469" dur="5.641">seeped into first century Judaism that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.9" dur="4.739">why it was such a shock that Gentiles</text>
  <text start="390.11" dur="2.2">could be converted and become part of</text>
  <text start="391.639" dur="6.031">Israel</text>
  <text start="392.31" dur="11.25">and and join join the Messiah okay so</text>
  <text start="397.67" dur="8.8">continuing on in Acts chapter 15 picking</text>
  <text start="403.56" dur="4.47">up in verse four and when they were come</text>
  <text start="406.47" dur="3">to Jerusalem they were received of the</text>
  <text start="408.03" dur="3.45">church and of the Apostles and elders</text>
  <text start="409.47" dur="4.56">and they declared all the things that</text>
  <text start="411.48" dur="4.26">you had done with them but there rose up</text>
  <text start="414.03" dur="3.78">a certain of the sect of the Pharisees</text>
  <text start="415.74" dur="3.6">which believed saying that it was</text>
  <text start="417.81" dur="3.48">needful to circumcise them and to</text>
  <text start="419.34" dur="3.81">command them to keep the law of Moses</text>
  <text start="421.29" dur="4.55">okay so again this is sort of a poor</text>
  <text start="423.15" dur="4.56">translation basically this is basically</text>
  <text start="425.84" dur="4.48">repeating the very same thing that was</text>
  <text start="427.71" dur="4.71">in verse one what they&amp;#39;re saying is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.32" dur="4.23">the same controversy that they needed to</text>
  <text start="432.42" dur="4.11">become circumsized after the manner of</text>
  <text start="434.55" dur="3.87">Moses is what they&amp;#39;re basically saying</text>
  <text start="436.53" dur="4.05">at this point in other words they need</text>
  <text start="438.42" dur="4.73">to follow all the rabbinic traditions</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="5.04">that had nothing to do with the Torah</text>
  <text start="443.15" dur="4.66">it&amp;#39;s the same problem that&amp;#39;s in verse 1</text>
  <text start="445.62" dur="4.77">but it&amp;#39;s badly translated error in the</text>
  <text start="447.81" dur="4.47">King James and then the Apostle and</text>
  <text start="450.39" dur="4.26">elders came together for to consider of</text>
  <text start="452.28" dur="4.5">this matter and when there had been much</text>
  <text start="454.65" dur="4.62">disputing Peter rose up and said unto</text>
  <text start="456.78" dur="4.5">them men and brethren you know how that</text>
  <text start="459.27" dur="4.29">a good while ago yah made choice among</text>
  <text start="461.28" dur="4.05">us that the Gentiles by my mouth should</text>
  <text start="463.56" dur="5.61">hear the word of the gospel and believe</text>
  <text start="465.33" dur="5.37">and yah which knows the hearts bear them</text>
  <text start="469.17" dur="4.17">witness giving them the Ruach Hakodesh</text>
  <text start="470.7" dur="5.31">the holy spirit even as he did unto us</text>
  <text start="473.34" dur="4.28">and he put no difference between us and</text>
  <text start="476.01" dur="4.41">then purifying their hearts by faith</text>
  <text start="477.62" dur="4.63">amen and again this should not have been</text>
  <text start="480.42" dur="3.87">a shock because this was this was a</text>
  <text start="482.25" dur="4.55">provision allowed even in the days of</text>
  <text start="484.29" dur="5.67">Moses and and before that</text>
  <text start="486.8" dur="5.23">now therefore why Tempe yah to put a</text>
  <text start="489.96" dur="4.08">yoke upon the neck of the disciples</text>
  <text start="492.03" dur="5.85">which neither our fathers nor we were</text>
  <text start="494.04" dur="6.09">able to bear okay so Peters talking</text>
  <text start="497.88" dur="4.14">about this yoke that neither our fathers</text>
  <text start="500.13" dur="3.9">nor we were able to bear now can he</text>
  <text start="502.02" dur="4.23">possibly really be talking about the</text>
  <text start="504.03" dur="6.51">Torah the commandments given from</text>
  <text start="506.25" dur="6.63">Genesis to Deuteronomy well according to</text>
  <text start="510.54" dur="5.37">Peter this was a yoke no one could bear</text>
  <text start="512.88" dur="5.31">yet if we go to Luke we&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="515.91" dur="4.14">go to the first</text>
  <text start="518.19" dur="3.3">and this I actually touched on this in</text>
  <text start="520.05" dur="4.56">my for my first part which I&amp;#39;m glad I</text>
  <text start="521.49" dur="5.159">did but in Luke chapter 1 starting in</text>
  <text start="524.61" dur="4.08">verses 5 &amp;amp; 6 there was in the days of</text>
  <text start="526.649" dur="4.17">Herod the king of Judea a certain priest</text>
  <text start="528.69" dur="4.709">named Zacharias of the course of Abia</text>
  <text start="530.819" dur="4.471">and his wife was of the daughters of</text>
  <text start="533.399" dur="3.901">Aaron and her name was Elizabeth and</text>
  <text start="535.29" dur="4.08">they were both righteous before yah</text>
  <text start="537.3" dur="5.159">walking in all the commandments and the</text>
  <text start="539.37" dur="5.579">ordinances of Yahweh blameless well</text>
  <text start="542.459" dur="4.8">right there we have two examples of</text>
  <text start="544.949" dur="3.271">humans in the New Testament who walked</text>
  <text start="547.259" dur="4.801">in all the commandments and ordinances</text>
  <text start="548.22" dur="7.859">blameless so no I can&amp;#39;t possibly be the</text>
  <text start="552.06" dur="10.139">oak if we go further back into</text>
  <text start="556.079" dur="11.331">Deuteronomy chapter 30 this was after</text>
  <text start="562.199" dur="7.591">all the commandments had been given and</text>
  <text start="567.41" dur="4.96">starting in verse 10 if you hearken unto</text>
  <text start="569.79" dur="4.289">the voice of Yahweh your Elohim to keep</text>
  <text start="572.37" dur="3.509">his commandments and his statutes which</text>
  <text start="574.079" dur="3.75">are written in the book of the law and</text>
  <text start="575.879" dur="3.57">if thou turn into Yahweh your Elohim</text>
  <text start="577.829" dur="4.591">with all your heart and with all your</text>
  <text start="579.449" dur="4.861">soul for this commandment which I</text>
  <text start="582.42" dur="5.219">command you this day it is not hidden</text>
  <text start="584.31" dur="5.339">from me neither is it far off it is not</text>
  <text start="587.639" dur="3.69">in heaven that you should say who shall</text>
  <text start="589.649" dur="4.141">go up for us to heaven and bring it unto</text>
  <text start="591.329" dur="4.231">us that we may hear it and do it neither</text>
  <text start="593.79" dur="3.45">is it beyond the sea that you should say</text>
  <text start="595.56" dur="3.149">who shall go over the sea for us and</text>
  <text start="597.24" dur="4.469">bring it unto us that we may hear it and</text>
  <text start="598.709" dur="5.101">do it but the word is very 9 to thee in</text>
  <text start="601.709" dur="6.12">your mouth and in your heart that you</text>
  <text start="603.81" dur="7.35">may do it see I have set before you this</text>
  <text start="607.829" dur="5.461">day life and good and death and evil and</text>
  <text start="611.16" dur="4.2">that I command thee this day to love</text>
  <text start="613.29" dur="3.57">Yahweh to walk in his ways and to keep</text>
  <text start="615.36" dur="3.329">his commandments and his statutes and</text>
  <text start="616.86" dur="4.26">his judgments that you may live and</text>
  <text start="618.689" dur="4.801">multiply Yahweh your Elohim shall bless</text>
  <text start="621.12" dur="4.709">thee in the land whither thou goest to</text>
  <text start="623.49" dur="5.459">possess it so it&amp;#39;s very clear here that</text>
  <text start="625.829" dur="4.68">yah himself says I&amp;#39;ve given you these</text>
  <text start="628.949" dur="3.39">Commandments I&amp;#39;ve given you this tour</text>
  <text start="630.509" dur="4.741">I&amp;#39;ve given you these laws and you can do</text>
  <text start="632.339" dur="5.461">it in fact Paul later goes on to quote</text>
  <text start="635.25" dur="3.689">this in Romans chapter 10 and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="637.8" dur="3.18">going to go over that in a future part</text>
  <text start="638.939" dur="4.95">and he literally replaces the word tour</text>
  <text start="640.98" dur="3.74">with Messiah because Messiah is the</text>
  <text start="643.889" dur="4.141">living</text>
  <text start="644.72" dur="7.42">so just from these two examples it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="648.03" dur="6.75">very clear that the these Commandments</text>
  <text start="652.14" dur="5.04">the Torah was not a yoke that no one</text>
  <text start="654.78" dur="4.05">could let the kid that are neither our</text>
  <text start="657.18" dur="3.6">fathers or firefighters could keep so</text>
  <text start="658.83" dur="4.29">Peter has to be talking about something</text>
  <text start="660.78" dur="5.88">else he&amp;#39;s got to be talking about</text>
  <text start="663.12" dur="5.31">something else well I&amp;#39;ll tell you what</text>
  <text start="666.66" dur="4.2">he&amp;#39;s talking about the yoke that neither</text>
  <text start="668.43" dur="6.15">they nor their forefathers could bear</text>
  <text start="670.86" dur="5.82">were all the man-made traditions were</text>
  <text start="674.58" dur="4.08">basically the controversy that was first</text>
  <text start="676.68" dur="4.59">stated in verse one and repeated again</text>
  <text start="678.66" dur="5.58">verse five and that is that you have to</text>
  <text start="681.27" dur="4.38">be circumcised after the manner of Moses</text>
  <text start="684.24" dur="2.91">or believed to come from roses which</text>
  <text start="685.65" dur="3.18">again has nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="687.15" dur="4.95">Abrahamic circumcision it has to do with</text>
  <text start="688.83" dur="5.13">all these man-made traditions that not</text>
  <text start="692.1" dur="4.17">even the Pharisees and Sadducees could</text>
  <text start="693.96" dur="5.22">keep okay and many of these traditions</text>
  <text start="696.27" dur="5.55">would violate the Torah one example</text>
  <text start="699.18" dur="5.43">would be you could pay a certain amount</text>
  <text start="701.82" dur="4.53">of money and call it Corbin and then you</text>
  <text start="704.61" dur="4.23">could basically dishonor your father and</text>
  <text start="706.35" dur="4.29">mother okay a tradition that the</text>
  <text start="708.84" dur="4.74">Pharisees and Sadducees had developed</text>
  <text start="710.64" dur="6.3">and directly violated a commandment and</text>
  <text start="713.58" dur="5.52">Torah so that is the yoke that no one</text>
  <text start="716.94" dur="4.56">could bear the yoke that no one could</text>
  <text start="719.1" dur="7.2">bear as all these rabbinic Talmudic</text>
  <text start="721.5" dur="7.2">traditions so Peters saying we shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="726.3" dur="5.01">try to put the Gentiles under these</text>
  <text start="728.7" dur="5.1">things now there were many traditions in</text>
  <text start="731.31" dur="4.47">the first century that were probably</text>
  <text start="733.8" dur="3.45">harmless that we&amp;#39;re probably fine to do</text>
  <text start="735.78" dur="2.91">maybe they weren&amp;#39;t rooted in Scripture</text>
  <text start="737.25" dur="3.18">but they didn&amp;#39;t necessarily violate</text>
  <text start="738.69" dur="3.96">Scripture and those were fine but again</text>
  <text start="740.43" dur="3.96">Peter saying we don&amp;#39;t need to impose</text>
  <text start="742.65" dur="3.9">that upon the Gentiles okay it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="744.39" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re coming in they&amp;#39;re becoming</text>
  <text start="746.55" dur="3.87">Israel and and they need to just obey</text>
  <text start="748.44" dur="3.87">the Torah the problem the first century</text>
  <text start="750.42" dur="4.38">is that the commandments and Torah were</text>
  <text start="752.31" dur="4.47">being mixed up with all these Talmudic</text>
  <text start="754.8" dur="3.41">traditions and that was the that was the</text>
  <text start="756.78" dur="8.97">problem</text>
  <text start="758.21" dur="9.07">okay so picking up from verse 10 but we</text>
  <text start="765.75" dur="3.66">believe that through the grace of our</text>
  <text start="767.28" dur="2.7">Adonai Yahshua HaMashiach we shall be</text>
  <text start="769.41" dur="3.24">saved</text>
  <text start="769.98" dur="4.8">even as they we shall be saved you see</text>
  <text start="772.65" dur="2.79">Peter even shows none of them have been</text>
  <text start="774.78" dur="2.25">saved yet</text>
  <text start="775.44" dur="2.85">remember what Yahshua said he said he</text>
  <text start="777.03" dur="4.83">that endures unto the end</text>
  <text start="778.29" dur="5.52">shall be saved okay the this whole thing</text>
  <text start="781.86" dur="4.919">that Oh were saved Oh we&amp;#39;re continuing</text>
  <text start="783.81" dur="3.719">to work out our salvation now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="786.779" dur="2.011">converted</text>
  <text start="787.529" dur="2.821">we&amp;#39;ve been converted our hearts</text>
  <text start="788.79" dur="5.52">shouldn&amp;#39;t be changed but he&amp;#39;s continuing</text>
  <text start="790.35" dur="6.479">to work in us and work through us and if</text>
  <text start="794.31" dur="3.959">we believe in the grace if we believe</text>
  <text start="796.829" dur="6.99">through that grace we shall be saved</text>
  <text start="798.269" dur="6.781">even as they okay so we&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="803.819" dur="3.21">continue in His grace and what does His</text>
  <text start="805.05" dur="3.599">grace teach us it&amp;#39;s in Titus chapter 2</text>
  <text start="807.029" dur="4.141">and we&amp;#39;ll go over that in a later part</text>
  <text start="808.649" dur="4.651">to Ty grace teaches us to live soberly</text>
  <text start="811.17" dur="7.62">righteously godly to keep the</text>
  <text start="813.3" dur="9.959">commandments to obey Him all right so</text>
  <text start="818.79" dur="5.76">acts 15 continues to go on basically</text>
  <text start="823.259" dur="5.07">describing that they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;ve reached</text>
  <text start="824.55" dur="5.789">this this agreement and here&amp;#39;s the the</text>
  <text start="828.329" dur="4.291">agreements and this is birthed by the</text>
  <text start="830.339" dur="3.661">ruach ha&amp;#39;qodesh the holy spirit it says</text>
  <text start="832.62" dur="3.269">wherefore my sentences that we trouble</text>
  <text start="834" dur="4.259">not then which from among the Gentiles</text>
  <text start="835.889" dur="4.861">our turn to yah but that we write unto</text>
  <text start="838.259" dur="3.361">them that they number one abstain from</text>
  <text start="840.75" dur="2.91">pollutions of idols</text>
  <text start="841.62" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s a commandment in Torah they</text>
  <text start="843.66" dur="4.35">abstain from fornication that is a</text>
  <text start="845.61" dur="5.58">commandment in Torah that they extend</text>
  <text start="848.01" dur="5.579">from meat that is strangled and from</text>
  <text start="851.19" dur="6.839">blood eating blood those are dietary</text>
  <text start="853.589" dur="6.24">laws in the Torah for because Moses of</text>
  <text start="858.029" dur="2.881">old time half in every city them that</text>
  <text start="859.829" dur="5.01">preach them being read in the</text>
  <text start="860.91" dur="6.72">synagogue&amp;#39;s every Sabbath day so as the</text>
  <text start="864.839" dur="4.321">Gentiles continue to go to synagogue and</text>
  <text start="867.63" dur="3.149">continue attend these home fellowships</text>
  <text start="869.16" dur="3.239">on Shabbat they&amp;#39;re gonna learn more and</text>
  <text start="870.779" dur="3.42">more about Torah they&amp;#39;re gonna grow and</text>
  <text start="872.399" dur="3.601">understand but at least they need to</text>
  <text start="874.199" dur="3.69">follow these four basic Commandments</text>
  <text start="876" dur="4.319">which are all again Commandments in the</text>
  <text start="877.889" dur="5.25">Torah so again this shows that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="880.319" dur="5.25">not they&amp;#39;re not saying oh stop doing the</text>
  <text start="883.139" dur="4.351">Torah don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t tell the Gentiles they</text>
  <text start="885.569" dur="3.931">need to do the tourists not the</text>
  <text start="887.49" dur="3.99">controversy here it is they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="889.5" dur="4.38">the Gentiles to be lost in all these</text>
  <text start="891.48" dur="6.51">Talmudic rabbinic traditions that have</text>
  <text start="893.88" dur="9.72">nothing to do with the word of yon</text>
  <text start="897.99" dur="8.31">okay and so then it pleased the Apostles</text>
  <text start="903.6" dur="4.26">and elders this is verse 22 what the</text>
  <text start="906.3" dur="2.849">whole church to send chosen men of their</text>
  <text start="907.86" dur="3.01">own company to Antioch with Paul</text>
  <text start="909.149" dur="6.461">Barnett&amp;#39;s namely Judah</text>
  <text start="910.87" dur="6.63">so then they send them off for as much</text>
  <text start="915.61" dur="4.74">we have heard this is verse 24 that</text>
  <text start="917.5" dur="4.56">certain which went out from from us have</text>
  <text start="920.35" dur="3.84">troubled you with words subverting your</text>
  <text start="922.06" dur="5.219">soul saying you must be circumcised and</text>
  <text start="924.19" dur="5.519">keep the law again this is a reference</text>
  <text start="927.279" dur="5.341">reference to circumcise after the manner</text>
  <text start="929.709" dur="5.221">of Moses and the law again that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="932.62" dur="4.649">referring to the Torah that&amp;#39;s referring</text>
  <text start="934.93" dur="4.649">to this Talmud to these oral traditions</text>
  <text start="937.269" dur="4.651">okay remember that word in Greek is no</text>
  <text start="939.579" dur="8.121">most and Nomos can refer to any body of</text>
  <text start="941.92" dur="9.12">regulations or Commandments and remember</text>
  <text start="947.7" dur="4.96">yas torah does not subvert your soul we</text>
  <text start="951.04" dur="6.479">just read in Deuteronomy 30 the yaws</text>
  <text start="952.66" dur="6.66">Torah brings life it brings life but</text>
  <text start="957.519" dur="8.82">traditions of men they definitely</text>
  <text start="959.32" dur="9.03">subvert your soul so then it continues</text>
  <text start="966.339" dur="3.661">about how they reach this for it seemed</text>
  <text start="968.35" dur="3.33">good to the ruach ha&amp;#39;qodesh to the holy</text>
  <text start="970" dur="4.23">spirit to us to lay upon you no greater</text>
  <text start="971.68" dur="3.99">burden then these necessary things and</text>
  <text start="974.23" dur="3.66">then they repeat it you abstain meats</text>
  <text start="975.67" dur="4.2">offered to idols that&amp;#39;s the commandment</text>
  <text start="977.89" dur="3.66">and Torah you&amp;#39;ve staying from blood</text>
  <text start="979.87" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s coming in and Torah abstain from</text>
  <text start="981.55" dur="3.75">things strangled kommandantur I am from</text>
  <text start="983.8" dur="3.63">fornication that&amp;#39;s the commandment in</text>
  <text start="985.3" dur="6.469">Torah from which if you keep yourselves</text>
  <text start="987.43" dur="4.339">you should do well very well</text>
  <text start="992.56" dur="4.95">so again telling the newly converted</text>
  <text start="995.05" dur="3.81">Gentiles which basically we&amp;#39;re no longer</text>
  <text start="997.51" dur="3.62">Gentiles because now they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="998.86" dur="5.88">grafted in by the blood of Messiah into</text>
  <text start="1001.13" dur="5.92">into true Israel telling them what they</text>
  <text start="1004.74" dur="5.539">needed to start off with would be a</text>
  <text start="1007.05" dur="3.229">launching pad into their faith</text>
  <text start="1010.699" dur="5.471">do-do-do-do-do so continuing now</text>
  <text start="1013.86" dur="4.76">rounding up the last little part of Acts</text>
  <text start="1016.17" dur="2.45">15</text>
  <text start="1020.76" dur="6.37">well that just talks about the the</text>
  <text start="1025.079" dur="5.461">dispute that Paul and Barnabas had so</text>
  <text start="1027.13" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t need to talk about that but so</text>
  <text start="1030.54" dur="6.69">again very clear it should be very clear</text>
  <text start="1032.41" dur="7.94">from Acts chapter 15 that number one</text>
  <text start="1037.23" dur="6.31">you&amp;#39;re not saved by the commandments the</text>
  <text start="1040.35" dur="4.81">your converted through Yahshua and he</text>
  <text start="1043.54" dur="3.68">leads you into obedience and these are</text>
  <text start="1045.16" dur="4.26">results of falling in love with him and</text>
  <text start="1047.22" dur="4.6">furthermore none of us are saved until</text>
  <text start="1049.42" dur="5.81">we endure until the end and until we</text>
  <text start="1051.82" dur="6.3">endure in His grace and then number two</text>
  <text start="1055.23" dur="3.67">and again being saved and converted are</text>
  <text start="1058.12" dur="2.61">two different things</text>
  <text start="1058.9" dur="3.42">okay being converted and falling in love</text>
  <text start="1060.73" dur="3.39">with Yahshua is not the same thing as</text>
  <text start="1062.32" dur="3.9">being saved we&amp;#39;re not ultimately save</text>
  <text start="1064.12" dur="3.87">until we&amp;#39;re standing before him with our</text>
  <text start="1066.22" dur="3.36">new bodies our new resurrected bodies</text>
  <text start="1067.99" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s when our salvation has been</text>
  <text start="1069.58" dur="4.44">complete right now it&amp;#39;s still birthing</text>
  <text start="1071.53" dur="5.4">within us and then number two that this</text>
  <text start="1074.02" dur="5.46">is not talking about the Torah this is</text>
  <text start="1076.93" dur="3.87">talking about the circumcision believed</text>
  <text start="1079.48" dur="2.55">to have come from Moses which is</text>
  <text start="1080.8" dur="4.08">basically a reference to all the</text>
  <text start="1082.03" dur="5.46">Talmudic rabbinic man-made traditions</text>
  <text start="1084.88" dur="5.76">that were truly a yoke that no one could</text>
  <text start="1087.49" dur="4.86">obey the Torah is obviously the Torah</text>
  <text start="1090.64" dur="3.75">that is actually given in the scriptures</text>
  <text start="1092.35" dur="3.99">is obviously something that we can obey</text>
  <text start="1094.39" dur="3.78">because yo said it and there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1096.34" dur="4.56">example of people who do it in the Book</text>
  <text start="1098.17" dur="4.86">of Luke alright I hope this second part</text>
