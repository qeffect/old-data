  <text start="9.179" dur="5.401">to back to working so I got back to</text>
  <text start="12.75" dur="4.35">Portland today and just reflecting and</text>
  <text start="14.58" dur="4.41">meditating on just how beautiful the</text>
  <text start="17.1" dur="5.49">places were that yot took me to I mean I</text>
  <text start="18.99" dur="4.98">really kind of breathed and experienced</text>
  <text start="22.59" dur="4.019">that scripture where it says all</text>
  <text start="23.97" dur="4.71">creation testifies to yaws glory I mean</text>
  <text start="26.609" dur="4.74">it just that Beach and that golden</text>
  <text start="28.68" dur="4.62">sunset and just everything was so so</text>
  <text start="31.349" dur="3.721">beautiful and not only that but I got to</text>
  <text start="33.3" dur="3.57">evangelize to some people as I was</text>
  <text start="35.07" dur="3.45">walking along the beach and and</text>
  <text start="36.87" dur="4.529">elsewhere so it was just it was just a</text>
  <text start="38.52" dur="6">beautiful Shabbat after the the eighth</text>
  <text start="41.399" dur="4.41">day a piece of Sukkot I do want to and I</text>
  <text start="44.52" dur="2.76">know people are saying well Daniel you</text>
  <text start="45.809" dur="3.75">know just let Cornerstone go</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="4.799">the thing is though is that you know</text>
  <text start="49.559" dur="4.89">Cornerstone and and and Rick Cheshire</text>
  <text start="52.079" dur="4.021">and Dale Henson but they need to be held</text>
  <text start="54.449" dur="4.95">accountable because what they&amp;#39;ve done is</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="5.279">is wrong and I just want to real quickly</text>
  <text start="59.399" dur="4.171">outline the facts again about what</text>
  <text start="61.379" dur="4.231">happened here on the fifth day of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="63.57" dur="3.93">the Holy Spirit as literally as I was</text>
  <text start="65.61" dur="4.259">doing laundry in Salem the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="6.06">came upon me and directed me to Isaiah</text>
  <text start="69.869" dur="5.851">29 and Isaiah 8 and then showed me how</text>
  <text start="73.56" dur="4.919">that those passages specifically applied</text>
  <text start="75.72" dur="5.219">to David and Leslie clue who had</text>
  <text start="78.479" dur="5.64">unrighteous ly and unlawfully banned me</text>
  <text start="80.939" dur="5.131">from the Molalla Sukkot and I was also</text>
  <text start="84.119" dur="6.871">how it applied to Micah rude and Monta</text>
  <text start="86.07" dur="7.68">Judah and you know isaiah 58:1 says lift</text>
  <text start="90.99" dur="4.5">up your voice like a trumpet show the</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="4.2">transgressions of my people israel and</text>
  <text start="95.49" dur="6.44">the house of Jacob their sins so what I</text>
  <text start="97.95" dur="7.11">did had biblical precedent and</text>
  <text start="101.93" dur="6.34">furthermore in that video I spoke very</text>
  <text start="105.06" dur="4.47">highly of Rick and Dale and a backhaul</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="2.76">of Cornerstone I was speaking very</text>
  <text start="109.53" dur="1.86">highly of the revival that was going on</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="3.54">there</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="5.339">so for Rick - I guess cave into the</text>
  <text start="114.57" dur="3.54">pressure from David and Leslie Klug and</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="4.021">from other individuals and corners from</text>
  <text start="118.11" dur="5.119">that were offended or whatever is wrong</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="4.979">I mean the Bible says he who loves Torah</text>
  <text start="123.229" dur="4.9">nothing nothing will offend them that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="125.729" dur="4.92">in one of the final verses of psalm 119</text>
  <text start="128.129" dur="4.601">so rather Rick should&amp;#39;ve just said hey</text>
  <text start="130.649" dur="3.971">Daniel did what the spirit of guy</text>
  <text start="132.73" dur="3.929">said and there&amp;#39;s precedent in the</text>
  <text start="134.62" dur="3.839">scripture maybe we may not all agree</text>
  <text start="136.659" dur="3.33">with how harsh she was but you know</text>
  <text start="138.459" dur="2.491">there is a biblical precedent there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="139.989" dur="4.14">nothing wrong that&amp;#39;s what he should have</text>
  <text start="140.95" dur="5.58">done but instead he kicked me off</text>
  <text start="144.129" dur="4.161">cornerstone right on the sixth day of</text>
  <text start="146.53" dur="5.819">Sukkot before the feast was even over</text>
  <text start="148.29" dur="5.71">and then a couple days later he contacts</text>
  <text start="152.349" dur="4.321">me personally and says hey by the way</text>
  <text start="154" dur="5.25">Daniel if you show up on cornerstone</text>
  <text start="156.67" dur="4.92">property I&amp;#39;m calling the police</text>
  <text start="159.25" dur="3.239">we&amp;#39;ve trespassed you off I mean guys</text>
  <text start="161.59" dur="3.479">that is wicked</text>
  <text start="162.489" dur="4.83">that&amp;#39;s just wicked so again a pastor</text>
  <text start="165.069" dur="4.051">Rick and Dale and cornerstone itself</text>
  <text start="167.319" dur="2.67">they need to be held accountable they</text>
  <text start="169.12" dur="3.479">can&amp;#39;t get away with this</text>
  <text start="169.989" dur="4.651">they are basically in a certain sense</text>
  <text start="172.599" dur="3.841">they&amp;#39;re sort of murdering the prophets</text>
  <text start="174.64" dur="3.989">and the preachers and those that are</text>
  <text start="176.44" dur="5.28">sent to them I was definitely sent to</text>
  <text start="178.629" dur="4.44">Cornerstone in fact I&amp;#39;ve never loved a</text>
  <text start="181.72" dur="3.72">congregation more than I like furnished</text>
  <text start="183.069" dur="5.491">I mean that place I loved it but</text>
  <text start="185.44" dur="4.919">nevertheless Rick now is in sin he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="188.56" dur="4.47">he&amp;#39;s in rebellion because 1st</text>
  <text start="190.359" dur="4.801">Corinthians 6 I mean man that passage</text>
  <text start="193.03" dur="4.079">says if you are not allowed to take</text>
  <text start="195.16" dur="3.96">another brother to the civil courts to</text>
  <text start="197.109" dur="4.74">law and for him to threaten me with</text>
  <text start="199.12" dur="5.16">police arrest if I were to show up on</text>
  <text start="201.849" dur="3.211">cornerstone to attend a service that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="204.28" dur="3.9">wickedness</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="4.47">so again Rick you need to repent you</text>
  <text start="208.18" dur="2.97">need to get your life right you are in</text>
  <text start="209.53" dur="3.63">sin I don&amp;#39;t care how much truth you know</text>
