  <text start="6.359" dur="3.721">beginning of the fourth day of the</text>
  <text start="8.37" dur="4.16">eighth Hebrew month the month of new</text>
  <text start="10.08" dur="5.519">beginnings and boy do I have a testimony</text>
  <text start="12.53" dur="6.37">so last week of course I shared that I</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="6.001">met a young Orthodox conservative Jew at</text>
  <text start="18.9" dur="4.5">the gym and after explaining to him the</text>
  <text start="21.6" dur="4.14">prophetic significance of the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="23.4" dur="4.98">feast days he gave his heart to Jesus to</text>
  <text start="25.74" dur="5.64">Yahshua and and he was born again and so</text>
  <text start="28.38" dur="5.699">I wanted to start deciphering him and</text>
  <text start="31.38" dur="4.62">his girlfriend and so I invited him out</text>
  <text start="34.079" dur="4.261">for dinner well tonight I met them for</text>
  <text start="36" dur="3.629">dinner and he and his girlfriend his</text>
  <text start="38.34" dur="3.27">girlfriend where&amp;#39;s the head covering and</text>
  <text start="39.629" dur="3.541">he Anna&amp;#39;s girlfriend or vegan so I</text>
  <text start="41.61" dur="3.24">wanted to accommodate them so we went to</text>
  <text start="43.17" dur="3.54">the place called the virtuous PI which</text>
  <text start="44.85" dur="5.25">is a vegan pizza place here in Portland</text>
  <text start="46.71" dur="5.91">and to be honest you know I&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="50.1" dur="4.049">such an emotional tailspin since my wife</text>
  <text start="52.62" dur="2.91">left me and I don&amp;#39;t even know when she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="54.149" dur="2.91">gonna return I mean it&amp;#39;s been really</text>
  <text start="55.53" dur="3.09">hard to deal with</text>
  <text start="57.059" dur="3.84">because I really love her and I care for</text>
  <text start="58.62" dur="4.739">her but it&amp;#39;s just been so wicked what</text>
  <text start="60.899" dur="7.501">she&amp;#39;s done and I&amp;#39;ve been an emotional</text>
  <text start="63.359" dur="6.541">tailspin and to be honest it was more of</text>
  <text start="68.4" dur="3.87">them ministering to me than me</text>
  <text start="69.9" dur="3.63">ministering to them I know that sounds</text>
  <text start="72.27" dur="3">ironic because I mean the whole reason</text>
  <text start="73.53" dur="3.93">why I asked him dinner was so I can</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="4.38">disciple him especially since he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="4.199">given his heart to the Lord and you know</text>
  <text start="79.65" dur="5.579">she&amp;#39;s sort of following his lead but um</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="5.221">I did share with them some things you</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="3.241">know concerning Yahshua and the</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="4.02">Scriptures and we sort of talked about</text>
  <text start="88.47" dur="3.78">prophecy a little bit too but gosh for</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="3.39">the first hour or so they were just</text>
  <text start="92.25" dur="4.11">asking me about my situation with my</text>
