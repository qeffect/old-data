  <text start="22.32" dur="5.67">teaching under the three types of</text>
  <text start="23.789" dur="7.021">Christians King Saul David and Solomon</text>
  <text start="27.99" dur="6.63">give us a clear model of the three types</text>
  <text start="30.81" dur="5.94">of Christians the salt light Christian</text>
  <text start="34.62" dur="4.02">had a promising beginning much like the</text>
  <text start="36.75" dur="4.469">seed that has planted and springs up</text>
  <text start="38.64" dur="4.65">instantly with joy but because the soul</text>
  <text start="41.219" dur="5.641">is rocky and there is no root the plant</text>
  <text start="43.29" dur="5.16">quickly withers and dies King Saul</text>
  <text start="46.86" dur="4.019">started off flooded with the ruach ha</text>
  <text start="48.45" dur="6.12">kodesh and filled with passion for</text>
  <text start="50.879" dur="5.61">Yahweh but within a very short period of</text>
  <text start="54.57" dur="4.05">time he began to separately disobey the</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="4.261">direct Commandments from yah and tried</text>
  <text start="58.62" dur="3.63">to form his own righteousness instead of</text>
  <text start="60.75" dur="4.739">the righteousness and conforming to the</text>
  <text start="62.25" dur="5.76">Torah his repeated acts of rebellion and</text>
  <text start="65.489" dur="6.901">lack of judgment eventually grieved both</text>
  <text start="68.01" dur="6.12">the Ruach and Samuel away eventually yah</text>
  <text start="72.39" dur="5.19">allowed tormenting spirits to grieve</text>
  <text start="74.13" dur="5.64">Saul when David was sent to plays music</text>
  <text start="77.58" dur="5.1">to melts all stubborn pride saw was</text>
  <text start="79.77" dur="4.86">given another space of repentance yet</text>
  <text start="82.68" dur="4.86">Saul grew jealous over David and sought</text>
  <text start="84.63" dur="4.77">to kill him after years of rebellion and</text>
  <text start="87.54" dur="4.14">torment consumed with jealousy pride</text>
  <text start="89.4" dur="6.3">bitterness and fear Saul took his own</text>
  <text start="91.68" dur="5.549">life and died in his transgressions the</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="3.599">sunlight Christian often finds himself</text>
  <text start="97.229" dur="3.6">in positions of power authority and</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="3.36">leadership they begin their Christian</text>
  <text start="100.829" dur="5.161">walk with much promise power and zeal</text>
  <text start="102.659" dur="5.161">for you however they begin to stubbornly</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="4.32">replace Yas righteousness with their own</text>
  <text start="107.82" dur="4.47">they compromise backslide refuse to</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="4.65">uphold judgment and allow the fear of</text>
  <text start="112.29" dur="4.17">man to consume them though repeatedly</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="3.509">hounded by yah they harden their hearts</text>
  <text start="116.46" dur="4.769">and then our jealous of any yah has</text>
  <text start="118.469" dur="4.44">raised up to replace them these saw</text>
  <text start="121.229" dur="3.691">light Christians often pastors of</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="4.5">congregations caused much damage as they</text>
  <text start="124.92" dur="4.05">seek to scatter the Sheep these are</text>
  <text start="127.409" dur="3.391">agents of the devil used a poison the</text>
  <text start="128.97" dur="4.06">congregation&amp;#39;s of yah and lead the</text>
  <text start="130.8" dur="5.17">cheapest train</text>
  <text start="133.03" dur="4.89">the Solomon Solomon ight Christians are</text>
  <text start="135.97" dur="4.23">those who also begin with much promise</text>
  <text start="137.92" dur="3.539">zeal and compassion for yah there are</text>
  <text start="140.2" dur="3.27">those whose hearts are perfect before</text>
  <text start="141.459" dur="5.791">yah but eventually hardened against job</text>
  <text start="143.47" dur="6.21">these Solomon ight Christians are like</text>
  <text start="147.25" dur="4.17">the seed planted among the thorns now</text>
  <text start="149.68" dur="3.48">while it grows and thrives the thorns</text>
  <text start="151.42" dur="4.649">and worries of life eventually choke the</text>
  <text start="153.16" dur="5.25">plant to death lust for wealth power and</text>
  <text start="156.069" dur="6.181">women drove Solomon into darkness</text>
  <text start="158.41" dur="6.109">sorcery and rebellion these solemn night</text>
  <text start="162.25" dur="6.36">Christians usually have great wealth</text>
  <text start="164.519" dur="5.561">resources skills and talents but as they</text>
  <text start="168.61" dur="3.15">are necessarily blessed by yacht in</text>
  <text start="170.08" dur="3.33">their goal of glorifying their Savior</text>
  <text start="171.76" dur="4.34">that become more in love with their</text>
  <text start="173.41" dur="5.07">success than the author of their success</text>
  <text start="176.1" dur="4.78">they&amp;#39;re lifted up and pride and become</text>
  <text start="178.48" dur="3.93">Laodicean removing the hearts far from</text>
  <text start="180.88" dur="3.84">yah as they bow their knee to the cares</text>
  <text start="182.41" dur="5.579">of this world and the riches yah had</text>
  <text start="184.72" dur="5.22">formerly blessed them with these Solomon</text>
  <text start="187.989" dur="3.511">I Christians may wield much powered</text>
  <text start="189.94" dur="3.299">influence and appear to be blessed of</text>
  <text start="191.5" dur="4.05">yah but their legacy can only lead to</text>
  <text start="193.239" dur="4.59">strife and civil war in the</text>
  <text start="195.55" dur="4.08">congregations of Yahweh as they harden</text>
  <text start="197.829" dur="4.171">their hearts and use their blessings for</text>
  <text start="199.63" dur="6.56">their own lusts their table of blessing</text>
  <text start="202" dur="6.39">is eventually made a snare unto them</text>
  <text start="206.19" dur="4.24">finally we have the Davidic Christians</text>
  <text start="208.39" dur="3.9">the Davidic Christians are those who</text>
  <text start="210.43" dur="4.68">have a heart after yacht and simply want</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="5.07">to place a smile on yo ways face what is</text>
  <text start="215.11" dur="4.56">ironic is that both Saul and Solomon</text>
  <text start="217.36" dur="5.849">began as Davidic Christians with hearts</text>
  <text start="219.67" dur="5.45">sold out to yah but they allowed sin and</text>
  <text start="223.209" dur="4.321">the words of this world to harden them</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="4.959">those who repent and are baptized in the</text>
  <text start="227.53" dur="4.32">Ruach began as Davidic Christians about</text>
  <text start="230.079" dur="3.811">depending on their choices they either</text>
  <text start="231.85" dur="5.55">remain Davidic or fall into a saw light</text>
  <text start="233.89" dur="5.34">or Solomon ight experience we must with</text>
  <text start="237.4" dur="4.08">sobriety understand that any one of us</text>
  <text start="239.23" dur="4.17">can become another saw or Solomon should</text>
  <text start="241.48" dur="5.19">we fail to walk in continual humility</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="4.649">and contract pneus of heart our goal</text>
  <text start="246.67" dur="4.17">each and every day should be the place</text>
  <text start="248.049" dur="4.371">of smile on yahshua&amp;#39;s face that should</text>
  <text start="250.84" dur="3.81">be the only motive of our hearts</text>
  <text start="252.42" dur="8.189">pursuing Yas pleasure will prevent us</text>
  <text start="254.65" dur="7.98">from passing into sin and apostasy I</text>
  <text start="260.609" dur="4.93">think you can tell that from this</text>
  <text start="262.63" dur="3.92">teaching you can relate both Saul and</text>
  <text start="265.539" dur="2.571">Solomon to the</text>
  <text start="266.55" dur="4.5">terrible the oshawa tells of the seed</text>
  <text start="268.11" dur="6.619">that Saul is very much like the seed</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="7.38">which fell among the rocky shallow soil</text>
  <text start="274.729" dur="5.68">and it didn&amp;#39;t last much at all justice</text>
  <text start="278.43" dur="5.88">all was pretty much only king for about</text>
  <text start="280.409" dur="5.491">two years the scripture shows us in the</text>
  <text start="284.31" dur="3.359">book of 1st Samuel he was he was only</text>
  <text start="285.9" dur="5.34">king for about two years before he</text>
  <text start="287.669" dur="8.37">allowed sin to pretty much dominate his</text>
  <text start="291.24" dur="7.35">life and his rule Solomon is very very</text>
  <text start="296.039" dur="4.201">much like the seed that falls among the</text>
  <text start="298.59" dur="3.18">thorns you know as it grows it gets</text>
  <text start="300.24" dur="3.59">choked out by the worries of the world</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="5.04">and by the lust of the flesh because</text>
  <text start="303.83" dur="6.1">Solomon know Solomon had everything he</text>
  <text start="306.81" dur="7.349">was blessed so much by Yahweh and yet he</text>
  <text start="309.93" dur="7.859">allowed his blessings to overcome him he</text>
  <text start="314.159" dur="7.891">shifted his gaze from Yahshua to his</text>
  <text start="317.789" dur="6.75">success and he allowed tons of women</text>
  <text start="322.05" dur="5.01">into his life women who were not pure of</text>
  <text start="324.539" dur="6.331">heart women who led Solomon astray and</text>
  <text start="327.06" dur="7.71">had Solomon erect asteroth poles inside</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="5.909">the very temple complex and so Solomon</text>
  <text start="334.77" dur="5.25">allowed his heart to drift away from</text>
  <text start="336.779" dur="4.44">Yahweh as well the thing that marked</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="3.449">David and I think the thing that</text>
  <text start="341.219" dur="4.26">separated David and the primary quality</text>
  <text start="343.469" dur="4.051">that made David distinct from both</text>
  <text start="345.479" dur="4.821">Solomon and Saul is that David always</text>
  <text start="347.52" dur="6.959">had a humility about him he always had a</text>
  <text start="350.3" dur="6.669">brokenness and a contrition of heart and</text>
  <text start="354.479" dur="4.231">this more than sacrifices more than</text>
  <text start="356.969" dur="3.75">anything else is what pleases Yahweh&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="5.459">to have a humble broken and contrite</text>
  <text start="360.719" dur="4.801">heart and David David went through a lot</text>
  <text start="364.169" dur="4.8">of hardship of course which I think</text>
  <text start="365.52" dur="5.009">helped keep him broken you know he often</text>
  <text start="368.969" dur="4.341">composed Psalms and he&amp;#39;s saying about</text>
  <text start="370.529" dur="5.75">this and and we see through his life</text>
  <text start="373.31" dur="5.5">that that he was a very broken man and</text>
  <text start="376.279" dur="5.621">it&amp;#39;s this contrition is this humility</text>
  <text start="378.81" dur="5.849">that really saved David many many times</text>
  <text start="381.9" dur="6.06">where David was often more prone to look</text>
  <text start="384.659" dur="7.32">at himself and examine himself before he</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="5.609">tried to blame others saw of course was</text>
  <text start="391.979" dur="5.381">obsessed with blaming others you know he</text>
  <text start="393.569" dur="5.38">became obsessed with with David and</text>
  <text start="397.36" dur="3.089">with the knowledge that David would</text>
  <text start="398.949" dur="5.761">replace him and so he was constantly</text>
  <text start="400.449" dur="5.701">trying to project danger upon David even</text>
  <text start="404.71" dur="3.299">when David was trying to be Saul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.15" dur="4.829">friend and was certainly a friend of his</text>
  <text start="408.009" dur="5.521">son Jonathan saw was always trying to</text>
  <text start="410.979" dur="5.43">blame the things that were going wrong</text>
  <text start="413.53" dur="4.919">on David and and and never never</text>
  <text start="416.409" dur="5.521">examined himself which which he should</text>
  <text start="418.449" dur="5.611">have done Solomon of course allowed a</text>
  <text start="421.93" dur="5.269">lot of the the things that surrounded</text>
  <text start="424.06" dur="5.729">him the wealth the blessings to</text>
  <text start="427.199" dur="7.12">captivate him to spell bind him and to</text>
  <text start="429.789" dur="6.211">get his eyes off of Yahweh Solomon of</text>
  <text start="434.319" dur="4.13">course he you know he&amp;#39;s talked about as</text>
  <text start="436" dur="5.52">the wisest king to have ever lived and</text>
  <text start="438.449" dur="4.84">fact when he was made king you know you</text>
  <text start="441.52" dur="4.47">always asked him what what do you desire</text>
  <text start="443.289" dur="5.25">and all Solomon asked of Yahweh was</text>
  <text start="445.99" dur="4.44">wisdom and I was so impressed and so</text>
  <text start="448.539" dur="3.99">happy that Solomon astral isn&amp;#39;t that he</text>
  <text start="450.43" dur="3.57">said not only will i give you wisdom but</text>
  <text start="452.529" dur="3.151">i&amp;#39;ll also give you the things you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="454" dur="3.75">ask for which is long life and and</text>
  <text start="455.68" dur="5.88">wealth and riches and he got all these</text>
  <text start="457.75" dur="6.15">things but even though wisdom is a</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="5.069">wonderful thing and and wisdom is</text>
  <text start="463.9" dur="6">extolled as a prominent virtue</text>
  <text start="466.629" dur="6.051">throughout the book of proverbs wisdom</text>
  <text start="469.9" dur="5.46">was not enough to keep Solomon from</text>
  <text start="472.68" dur="4.03">falling away of course the argument can</text>
  <text start="475.36" dur="4.26">be made that Solomon departed from</text>
  <text start="476.71" dur="5.25">wisdom but more than wisdom because</text>
  <text start="479.62" dur="4.68">David may not have been the wisest King</text>
  <text start="481.96" dur="4.769">to have ever lived but he certainly was</text>
  <text start="484.3" dur="5.429">one of the most humble Kings to have</text>
  <text start="486.729" dur="4.41">ruled over Israel and Jerusalem and so I</text>
  <text start="489.729" dur="3.18">think it&amp;#39;s that humility it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="491.139" dur="6.27">contrition it&amp;#39;s that brokenness of heart</text>
  <text start="492.909" dur="6.06">it&amp;#39;s that daily reminder to keep your</text>
  <text start="497.409" dur="3.391">eyes completely and totally centered on</text>
  <text start="498.969" dur="5.641">Yahshua despite the circumstances around</text>
  <text start="500.8" dur="6.089">you that keeps you from getting in</text>
  <text start="504.61" dur="8.58">trouble and that we need to always</text>
  <text start="506.889" dur="9.21">remember that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very easy to to</text>
  <text start="513.19" dur="5.159">allow the cares of this world will creep</text>
  <text start="516.099" dur="5.761">into our life and to distract us from</text>
  <text start="518.349" dur="5.25">our mission from our goal and we need to</text>
  <text start="521.86" dur="3.539">recognize that you know we have the</text>
  <text start="523.599" dur="4.281">potential to follow in the footsteps of</text>
  <text start="525.399" dur="4.131">Saul or Solomon you know</text>
  <text start="527.88" dur="3.6">often when we think of King Saul we</text>
  <text start="529.53" dur="3.96">forget that you know for the first two</text>
  <text start="531.48" dur="4.23">years of his life he was filled with the</text>
  <text start="533.49" dur="4.02">zeal for Yahweh now he was filled with</text>
  <text start="535.71" dur="4.56">the ruach ha kadosh in he was a mighty</text>
  <text start="537.51" dur="4.53">man of yon he was a tall Benjamin people</text>
  <text start="540.27" dur="4.14">looked up to him and he was he walked</text>
  <text start="542.04" dur="8.12">with Samuel me he he was considered a</text>
  <text start="544.41" dur="8.88">prophet and a king and yet he fell and</text>
  <text start="550.16" dur="4.78">the same thing happened to Solomon so we</text>
  <text start="553.29" dur="5.58">need to remember that no matter what</text>
  <text start="554.94" dur="6.12">kind of beginning place that we start</text>
  <text start="558.87" dur="6.48">from it&amp;#39;s much more important where we</text>
  <text start="561.06" dur="5.7">end and you know Yahshua himself said he</text>
  <text start="565.35" dur="3.21">that indoors until the end she&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="566.76" dur="5.37">saved and we need to keep those words</text>
  <text start="568.56" dur="5.16">take them to heart treasure them because</text>
  <text start="572.13" dur="3.03">it&amp;#39;s very important where we end up much</text>
