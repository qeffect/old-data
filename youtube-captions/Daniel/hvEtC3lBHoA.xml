  <text start="18.09" dur="7.62">on September 30th 1997 I was actually</text>
  <text start="22.769" dur="6.77">sitting underneath a tree at a park</text>
  <text start="25.71" dur="7.56">bench on my lunch break from work and</text>
  <text start="29.539" dur="6.671">for the very first time I met Yahshua I</text>
  <text start="33.27" dur="4.859">met Jesus the Messiah I had actually</text>
  <text start="36.21" dur="4.14">been seeking him for about a month month</text>
  <text start="38.129" dur="6.781">and a half leading up to that day been</text>
  <text start="40.35" dur="6.9">really just trying to cry out to him and</text>
  <text start="44.91" dur="4.559">try to figure out who he was and and</text>
  <text start="47.25" dur="5.07">where where he is and what you know what</text>
  <text start="49.469" dur="4.351">this was all about and I remembered this</text>
  <text start="52.32" dur="4.44">day as I was sitting underneath that</text>
  <text start="53.82" dur="4.86">tree i had my Bible open and I was</text>
  <text start="56.76" dur="4.889">reading in Philippians and it was that</text>
  <text start="58.68" dur="4.98">verse that said to live his Christ but</text>
  <text start="61.649" dur="5.191">the die is gain like when i read that</text>
  <text start="63.66" dur="5.79">verse all of a sudden this unexplainable</text>
  <text start="66.84" dur="5.97"> happened where it was like yeah</text>
  <text start="69.45" dur="5.79">shua christ was in sight I realized that</text>
  <text start="72.81" dur="4.42">trying to do all these things and living</text>
  <text start="75.24" dur="3.91">up to the word of the Bible</text>
  <text start="77.23" dur="3.96">living a good life he had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="79.15" dur="4.98">with me and had to do with allowing him</text>
  <text start="81.19" dur="4.98">to live in the center of homes in the</text>
  <text start="84.13" dur="4.35">depths the very core of who I was in</text>
  <text start="86.17" dur="5.52">letting him live through me and that</text>
  <text start="88.48" dur="5.7">verse caused that shift it was like you</text>
  <text start="91.69" dur="4.47">know my countenance have been so filled</text>
  <text start="94.18" dur="5.16">with despair and hopelessness and just</text>
  <text start="96.16" dur="4.89">crushed in the weeks leading up to that</text>
  <text start="99.34" dur="3.66">day and then all of a sudden my</text>
  <text start="101.05" dur="4.53">continent countenance just changed I</text>
  <text start="103" dur="4.83">mean just dramatically glow just filled</text>
  <text start="105.58" dur="5.43">my face and I knew I had finally met the</text>
  <text start="107.83" dur="5.7">Messiah I&amp;#39;d finally met Jesus and for</text>

  <text start="146" dur="7.41">scriptural study 17 is always a symbolic</text>
  <text start="150.319" dur="5.101">of victory of overcoming of victory and</text>
