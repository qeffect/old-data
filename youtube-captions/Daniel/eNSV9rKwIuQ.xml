  <text start="61.32" dur="3.839">shocking we always thought that South</text>

  <text start="78.81" dur="5.57">it I have here where the South Dakota</text>
  <text start="81.38" dur="3">was</text>
  <text start="86.18" dur="4.53">the second most corrupt state in the</text>
  <text start="88.4" dur="5.67">nation we&amp;#39;ve been the second lowest</text>
  <text start="90.71" dur="7.04">state we&amp;#39;ve been most corrupt the fifth</text>
  <text start="94.07" dur="7.82">was corrupt and even Charles Grassley</text>
  <text start="97.75" dur="7.03">was saying how corrupt South Dakota was</text>
  <text start="101.89" dur="5.14">and yet we have this good Christian</text>
  <text start="104.78" dur="4.8">state and our leaders are actually</text>
  <text start="107.03" dur="3.87">otherwise but what started that the</text>
  <text start="109.58" dur="4.35">people believing that there was</text>
  <text start="110.9" dur="5.88">corruption was the death of a man named</text>
  <text start="113.93" dur="6.299">Richard bender Richard benda was</text>
  <text start="116.78" dur="5.25">involved with the Chinese South Dakota</text>
  <text start="120.229" dur="4.651">by the way is very involved with the</text>
  <text start="122.03" dur="4.62">Chinese there&amp;#39;s a book called the new</text>
  <text start="124.88" dur="4.17">American on magazine called a new</text>
  <text start="126.65" dur="6.45">American that says how America is</text>
  <text start="129.05" dur="6.44">selling ourselves our energy our food</text>
  <text start="133.1" dur="4.95">supplies our water</text>
  <text start="135.49" dur="5.17">we&amp;#39;re selling all our goods and natural</text>
  <text start="138.05" dur="4.5">resources to the Chinese how we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="140.66" dur="3.48">that is through the governor&amp;#39;s in our</text>
  <text start="142.55" dur="4.11">governor has taken several trips to</text>
  <text start="144.14" dur="6.17">China and so had this man his name was</text>
  <text start="146.66" dur="6.72">Richard benda and they were using a</text>
  <text start="150.31" dur="5.02">federal program called the eb-5 program</text>
  <text start="153.38" dur="5.52">what that is is that a foreign national</text>
  <text start="155.33" dur="6.27">can give South Dakota a half a million</text>
  <text start="158.9" dur="4.83">dollars each and that South Dakota can</text>
  <text start="161.6" dur="4.5">use that money than to invest in any</text>
  <text start="163.73" dur="5.88">kind of business and in order to get</text>
  <text start="166.1" dur="5.07">business up in South Dakota well we um I</text>
  <text start="169.61" dur="4.5">took in I think like two hundred and</text>
  <text start="171.17" dur="6.75">thirty two million dollars tons</text>
  <text start="174.11" dur="7.159">evie full yeah um and and nobody really</text>
  <text start="177.92" dur="6.62">knows because it is all quite hidden but</text>
  <text start="181.269" dur="5.651">we had it like I think was like 90</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="3.94">investors in this one project not the</text>
  <text start="186.92" dur="3.03">only the one project is the only one</text>
  <text start="188.48" dur="4.11">that got the attention there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="189.95" dur="5.069">several eb-5 programs but the one was</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="4.459">the northern beef brought in Aberdeen</text>
  <text start="195.019" dur="5.731">very close to her Debbie Debbie lives</text>
  <text start="197.049" dur="5.861">and this man who&amp;#39;d gone over to China</text>
  <text start="200.75" dur="5.58">and had gotten a lot of investors to</text>
  <text start="202.91" dur="5.97">come over was found dead in Howard I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="206.33" dur="5.34">sorry in Leakey Andes South Dakota close</text>
  <text start="208.88" dur="5.86">to where I live and all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="211.67" dur="5.23">found out about this program a b5</text>
  <text start="214.74" dur="4.32">and then we now South Dakota is one of</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="4.68">the two states in the nation who&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="5.1">corrupted the eb-5 program that we are</text>
  <text start="221.58" dur="4.89">not allowed to use it anymore however we</text>
  <text start="224.16" dur="4.44">still have the same context from China</text>
  <text start="226.47" dur="3.48">and other nations that we used and I</text>
  <text start="228.6" dur="4.56">still think that we&amp;#39;re selling our</text>
  <text start="229.95" dur="7.74">national resources to over-broad to to</text>
  <text start="233.16" dur="7.65">our enemies well and here&amp;#39;s the one</text>
  <text start="237.69" dur="4.65">about I&amp;#39;m gonna start it a little bit</text>
  <text start="240.81" dur="3.48">different here I showed you an Ripper</text>
  <text start="242.34" dur="5.82">started talking as there&amp;#39;s a book called</text>
  <text start="244.29" dur="7.83">the deeper state and it&amp;#39;s the deep state</text>
  <text start="248.16" dur="6.42">and Daniel you you probably are more</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="4.53">exposing the play time of the deeper</text>
  <text start="254.58" dur="4.77">state which involves the the children</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="5.58">and how they are using the children for</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="4.53">their their pastime I can&amp;#39;t hardly</text>
  <text start="262.23" dur="3.96">handle that so I don&amp;#39;t go delve into</text>
  <text start="263.88" dur="5.61">that I do delve into how they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="6.15">the finances in taking our resources the</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="4.92">deep state is this book here says</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="5.67">basically it&amp;#39;s a spiritual war that the</text>
  <text start="274.41" dur="6.48">deeper state is very religious in nature</text>
  <text start="278.01" dur="5.67">it has to do with hidden societies the</text>
  <text start="280.89" dur="6.51">some of the symbolism i an&amp;#39;t in here are</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="6.75">the Masonic symbols that that the deep</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="4.62">state uses secret societies and and we</text>
  <text start="290.43" dur="3.54">all know where the upper levels of</text>
  <text start="292.02" dur="5.31">secret societies what they do with</text>
  <text start="293.97" dur="7.26">children and I don&amp;#39;t think South Dakota</text>
  <text start="297.33" dur="5.46">is immune from that either so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="301.23" dur="5.21">actually going to entertain that for a</text>
  <text start="302.79" dur="7.2">little bit South Dakota had um a</text>
  <text start="306.44" dur="6.88">notorious case called the the Metis rape</text>
  <text start="309.99" dur="6.45">case where a man his name was Richard</text>
  <text start="313.32" dur="6.15">and Metis raped Indian children that he</text>
  <text start="316.44" dur="6.66">had foster cared okay and he basically</text>
  <text start="319.47" dur="7.26">got completely by with it he he was able</text>
  <text start="323.1" dur="6.21">to keep the children he went sizing to 6</text>
  <text start="326.73" dur="4.05">months in prison and then that the girls</text>
  <text start="329.31" dur="4.29">who were raped Indian girls who were</text>
  <text start="330.78" dur="5.67">raped went back to his the home where</text>
  <text start="333.6" dur="7.1">where they were being raped the reason</text>
  <text start="336.45" dur="8.03">why South Dakota does this is because</text>
  <text start="340.7" dur="6.69">get about half of our half of our budget</text>
  <text start="344.48" dur="4.68">is from the foster care system we get</text>
  <text start="347.39" dur="5.16">seventy nine thousand dollars per child</text>
  <text start="349.16" dur="6.47">who is put into the foster system okay</text>
  <text start="352.55" dur="5.85">now if they have development</text>
  <text start="355.63" dur="4.69">disabilities we get more money if they</text>
  <text start="358.4" dur="3.54">put them on these massive drugs like</text>
  <text start="360.32" dur="3.63">ritalin and such like that or</text>
  <text start="361.94" dur="4.95">antipsychotic drugs we get even more</text>
  <text start="363.95" dur="5.79">money so there&amp;#39;s an emphasis to to take</text>
  <text start="366.89" dur="4.26">kids label them disabled which of all</text>
  <text start="369.74" dur="4.77">the Indian children are labeled to say</text>
  <text start="371.15" dur="6.2">are disabled per a test that&amp;#39;s given</text>
  <text start="374.51" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s interesting because our governor um</text>
  <text start="377.35" dur="3.28">when he was a lieutenant governor</text>
  <text start="379.37" dur="3.75">governor Dugard</text>
  <text start="380.63" dur="5.76">he was the CEO of Children&amp;#39;s Home</text>
  <text start="383.12" dur="6.24">Society he Children&amp;#39;s Home Society</text>
  <text start="386.39" dur="6.62">is the one who according to hear this</text>
  <text start="389.36" dur="6.71">article here Children&amp;#39;s Home Society</text>
  <text start="393.01" dur="7.9">they are the ones who determine abuse</text>
  <text start="396.07" dur="9.22">they determine who can call abuse they</text>
  <text start="400.91" dur="6.45">train the the workers and he that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="405.29" dur="6.21">he who he worked for now when he became</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="7.1">governor child abuse rose 39 percent</text>
  <text start="411.5" dur="5.97">which means we took yeah which means</text>
  <text start="414.46" dur="5.86">more more children went into Children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="417.47" dur="5.13">Home Society um at first it was just the</text>
  <text start="420.32" dur="7.23">Indian children okay but now it seems to</text>
  <text start="422.6" dur="6.84">be um almost just any child they are</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="4.98">being taken from the families on very</text>
  <text start="429.44" dur="4.44">shaky grounds in my opinion and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="432.53" dur="2.46">going through the foster system going</text>
  <text start="433.88" dur="2.91">through Family Court which is very</text>
  <text start="434.99" dur="4.41">expensive and the state reaps the</text>
  <text start="436.79" dur="6.75">benefits from it um half of our budget</text>
  <text start="439.4" dur="7.29">from that system um so that that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="443.54" dur="7.77">part of the here child abuse how its</text>
  <text start="446.69" dur="6.15">raising in South Dakota and how that</text>
  <text start="451.31" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s an article two on how the</text>
  <text start="452.84" dur="3.93">governor had increased by thirty thirty</text>
  <text start="454.97" dur="4.74">nine percent in his first two years um</text>
  <text start="456.77" dur="6.21">and now he&amp;#39;s going to be go back to work</text>
  <text start="459.71" dur="6.24">for Sanford which is the major player in</text>
  <text start="462.98" dur="5.97">in South Dakota so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="465.95" dur="4.92">problem with with the children&amp;#39;s side of</text>
  <text start="468.95" dur="4.17">it now another part is well I was</text>
  <text start="470.87" dur="3.009">talking about was the benda nono benda</text>

  <text start="492.089" dur="5.82">like three times this in my office here</text>
  <text start="495.449" dur="5.99">he was found by his brother-in-law and</text>
  <text start="497.909" dur="7.26">his brother outlaw said that there was</text>
  <text start="501.439" dur="7.63">no no blood he looked like he had a</text>
  <text start="505.169" dur="8.73">heart attack and then that the coroner</text>
  <text start="509.069" dur="8.4">came and um he said that he died of a</text>
  <text start="513.899" dur="7.88">gunshot wound to his abdomen to the side</text>
  <text start="517.469" dur="7.56">or his liver area and there was no blood</text>
  <text start="521.779" dur="6.071">the first person his brother-in-law said</text>
  <text start="525.029" dur="5">that and then um that article said that</text>
  <text start="527.85" dur="4.65">it was secured well I talked to the</text>
  <text start="530.029" dur="4.3">reporter who was the first on the scene</text>
  <text start="532.5" dur="3.93">he said it wasn&amp;#39;t secured there was no</text>
  <text start="534.329" dur="4.221">tape anywhere he said anybody who come</text>
  <text start="536.43" dur="6.36">and go as they wanted it was not secured</text>
  <text start="538.55" dur="5.5">and I have an email here from a man who</text>
  <text start="542.79" dur="3.84">said that he talked to the county</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="4.589">commissioner that said it was odd</text>
  <text start="546.63" dur="5.189">because he shot himself in the belly</text>
  <text start="548.639" dur="7.471">died two days later and the gun was up</text>
  <text start="551.819" dur="8.341">against the tree so he shot himself from</text>

  <text start="560.16" dur="5.25">them here&amp;#39;s the search I had to get a</text>
  <text start="563.43" dur="3.81">Boyar request to get this this is his</text>
  <text start="565.41" dur="6.859">death certificate and I thought it was</text>
  <text start="567.24" dur="8.3">odd because the official was Chad Peters</text>
  <text start="572.269" dur="5.251">now you look here</text>
  <text start="575.54" dur="4.89">Chad Peters does not have a license</text>

  <text start="587.93" dur="3.3">told me</text>
  <text start="588.71" dur="3.39">deputy coroner&amp;#39;s do not investigate</text>
  <text start="591.23" dur="3.66">crime scenes</text>

  <text start="594.89" dur="5.16">certificates but but that&amp;#39;s the person</text>
  <text start="597.98" dur="3.93">that our Attorney General it says is the</text>
  <text start="600.05" dur="3.78">authority now he also mentioned that</text>
  <text start="601.91" dur="5.04">there was a his name is Ken Snell that</text>
  <text start="603.83" dur="7.29">the state pathologist who also concurred</text>
  <text start="606.95" dur="6.06">with the some reason of suicide and mode</text>
  <text start="611.12" dur="4.74">and ice and thing but it&amp;#39;s called so I</text>
  <text start="613.01" dur="4.68">called him he did not concur on the</text>
  <text start="615.86" dur="4.77">phone to me in fact his voice raised</text>
  <text start="617.69" dur="4.14">about two octaves said he said he had</text>
  <text start="620.63" dur="4.17">nothing to do with that and I was</text>
  <text start="621.83" dur="4.92">supposed to call the sheriff in Gregory</text>
  <text start="624.8" dur="4.23">County I did not get a hold of sheriff</text>
  <text start="626.75" dur="6.18">butt and I just kind of gave up kind of</text>
  <text start="629.03" dur="5.58">trying but so obviously what the what</text>
  <text start="632.93" dur="4.8">the AG is saying and what&amp;#39;s actually</text>

  <text start="640.94" dur="6.33">else about that oh yeah the autopsy was</text>
  <text start="644.63" dur="5.34">performed and we asked a FOIA request</text>
  <text start="647.27" dur="5.88">for the autopsy but of but a state and</text>
  <text start="649.97" dur="5.13">federal autopsy was refused now it says</text>
  <text start="653.15" dur="4.29">on a death certificate that the atop</text>
  <text start="655.1" dur="4.86">autopsy is available but we can&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="657.44" dur="3.78">can&amp;#39;t have it by law he was a public</text>
  <text start="659.96" dur="3.93">official and we&amp;#39;re supposed to be able</text>
  <text start="661.22" dur="6.36">to have that autopsy okay then a little</text>
  <text start="663.89" dur="7.58">bit later there was another death of an</text>

  <text start="789.089" dur="7.11">there&amp;#39;s a lot of holes in this story um</text>
  <text start="793.579" dur="4.6">one was that he didn&amp;#39;t own a gun</text>
  <text start="796.199" dur="4.85">one thing he borrowed the gun from a</text>

  <text start="803.339" dur="4.8">two different loads in my opinion that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="805.529" dur="4.98">possible but it&amp;#39;s also probable that</text>
  <text start="808.139" dur="5.55">there&amp;#39;s two different guns the Attorney</text>
  <text start="810.509" dur="5.19">General said he was found right here in</text>

  <text start="819.179" dur="4.05">received the bodies and he said that the</text>

  <text start="823.229" dur="3.96">Scott West Charles was not found in the</text>
  <text start="825.299" dur="4.19">house he was found a mile away in a</text>
  <text start="827.189" dur="7.38">field okay so why there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="829.489" dur="7.59">discrepancy um and he also said that the</text>
  <text start="834.569" dur="5.1">girls in this horrendous fire which</text>
  <text start="837.079" dur="6.46">collapsed the building the beds what the</text>
  <text start="839.669" dur="6.54">girls were on were destroyed to the</text>
  <text start="843.539" dur="5.43">frame and the the floor were the bed was</text>
  <text start="846.209" dur="4.83">on collapsed do that to the the fire and</text>
  <text start="848.969" dur="5.48">they were found in the basement yet they</text>
  <text start="851.039" dur="5.91">weren&amp;#39;t burned the girls were not burned</text>
  <text start="854.449" dur="4.66">that&amp;#39;s what he said he said I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="856.949" dur="3.93">imagine them coming out where everything</text>
  <text start="859.109" dur="2.22">is burnt to a crisp and they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="860.879" dur="2.94">burned</text>
  <text start="861.329" dur="3.72">they said they were dried out the bodies</text>
  <text start="863.819" dur="6.33">were dried but they weren&amp;#39;t even burned</text>
  <text start="865.049" dur="7.86">um just to just to recap everything that</text>
  <text start="870.149" dur="4.8">you said so far so basically what what</text>
  <text start="872.909" dur="6.27">you&amp;#39;re sort of leading to is that both</text>
  <text start="874.949" dur="7.08">benda and this family of six they were</text>
  <text start="879.179" dur="4.49">murdered I think they weren&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="882.029" dur="3.66">weren&amp;#39;t these victims or a suicide</text>
  <text start="883.669" dur="5.26">murderer or whatever they were actually</text>
  <text start="885.689" dur="5.28">murdered by I guess people higher up in</text>
  <text start="888.929" dur="4.35">in South Dakota that because they were</text>
  <text start="890.969" dur="3.99">in some way trying to uncover how these</text>
  <text start="893.279" dur="4.65">nonprofits and all description was being</text>
  <text start="894.959" dur="4.83">used for the for the human trafficking</text>
  <text start="897.929" dur="5.31">child sex trafficking is that is that</text>
  <text start="899.789" dur="5.52">kind of I I don&amp;#39;t have to do the child</text>
  <text start="903.239" dur="4.05">sex trafficking but I I think that is</text>
  <text start="905.309" dur="5.1">part of South Dakota I think that has to</text>
  <text start="907.289" dur="4.95">do with the children</text>
  <text start="910.409" dur="5.94">Children&amp;#39;s Protective Services I think</text>
  <text start="912.239" dur="5.85">it has to do with we have um the Indian</text>
  <text start="916.349" dur="3.45">that seems to be the Indian Reservation</text>
  <text start="918.089" dur="2.961">seems to be a place to pick up girls</text>
  <text start="919.799" dur="3.681">because a lot</text>
  <text start="921.05" dur="4.68">nobody cares you know what goes on there</text>
  <text start="923.48" dur="3.96">and it&amp;#39;s so remote that you try to get</text>
  <text start="925.73" dur="4.17">the word out and just kind of stops at</text>
  <text start="927.44" dur="4.47">the next road which is like five miles</text>
  <text start="929.9" dur="4.38">away so we don&amp;#39;t get the information</text>
  <text start="931.91" dur="4.83">that we should off the reservations but</text>
  <text start="934.28" dur="6.3">um yeah I think that goes on here in</text>
  <text start="936.74" dur="7.44">fact um you know that who&amp;#39;s the guy I</text>
  <text start="940.58" dur="5.13">got here some place in Tucson he said</text>
  <text start="944.18" dur="2.79">there was a traffic you can ring down</text>

  <text start="954.2" dur="5.4">these he&amp;#39;s ties on the trees at this one</text>
  <text start="956.93" dur="4.38">camp just south of Tucson Arizona yeah</text>
  <text start="959.6" dur="5.37">you&amp;#39;re talking about Louis author from</text>

  <text start="964.97" dur="7.02">huge huge camp down in in Arizona yeah</text>
  <text start="967.58" dur="9.87">um they were found on the land that was</text>

  <text start="977.45" dur="2.76">South Dakota South Dakota sold their</text>
  <text start="979.07" dur="2.52">cement plant which is kind of a</text>
  <text start="980.21" dur="2.88">socialistic thing anyway I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="981.59" dur="5.19">why stuff to go to ever owned a cement</text>
  <text start="983.09" dur="7.02">plant we ended up selling it using we</text>
  <text start="986.78" dur="6.84">under selling it - I think semak&amp;#39;s which</text>
  <text start="990.11" dur="5.22">is part of the CCU so we have a</text>
  <text start="993.62" dur="4.14">connection right there we sold our</text>

  <text start="1183.58" dur="4.32">Guard she was a whistleblower because</text>
  <text start="1185.05" dur="5.37">she uncovered this 2.7 million dollars</text>
  <text start="1187.9" dur="4.59">that she believes was embezzled</text>
  <text start="1190.42" dur="5.1">basically she knows was embezzled she</text>
  <text start="1192.49" dur="5.67">wound up getting discharge it was unfair</text>
  <text start="1195.52" dur="4.41">what they did with the medical discharge</text>
  <text start="1198.16" dur="4.44">she wanted getting discharge moving back</text>
  <text start="1199.93" dur="4.8">up to Minnesota and then she moved over</text>
  <text start="1202.6" dur="5.07">or she went over to the Dakotas and</text>
  <text start="1204.73" dur="5.16">Debbie I want you to kind of explain how</text>
  <text start="1207.67" dur="5.18">you met Laura and what that whole</text>
  <text start="1209.89" dur="5.34">relationship was and and just go ahead</text>

  <text start="1215.23" dur="6.09">was starting to put together some</text>
  <text start="1217.84" dur="4.65">meetings in Aberdeen South Dakota and</text>
  <text start="1221.32" dur="3.33">she would Burton who&amp;#39;s bringing in</text>
  <text start="1222.49" dur="5.82">different whistleblowers to speak at the</text>
  <text start="1224.65" dur="6.48">Civic Center in Aberdeen and I think we</text>
  <text start="1228.31" dur="6.06">kind of I came in contact with her and</text>
  <text start="1231.13" dur="8.16">she put me contact with Laura because</text>
  <text start="1234.37" dur="7.11">Laura had because we had similar stories</text>
  <text start="1239.29" dur="4.2">of trying to uncover things but</text>
  <text start="1241.48" dur="4.53">basically then Laura and I started</text>
  <text start="1243.49" dur="5.16">connecting the dots between Arizona and</text>
  <text start="1246.01" dur="4.86">South Dakota because McCain was good</text>
  <text start="1248.65" dur="6.06">friends apparently with soon--and rounds</text>
  <text start="1250.87" dur="6.57">senator thune and rounds so and I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1254.71" dur="4.53">know this but she&amp;#39;s a she&amp;#39;s the one who</text>
  <text start="1257.44" dur="3.63">told me that there was like a big</text>
  <text start="1259.24" dur="6">connection there between McCain for</text>
  <text start="1261.07" dur="6.33">years and rounds right Laura yes yeah</text>
  <text start="1265.24" dur="3.54">and I didn&amp;#39;t know that so then you know</text>
  <text start="1267.4" dur="4.62">we kind of started connecting certain</text>
  <text start="1268.78" dur="5.16">dots and I believe that McCain was very</text>
  <text start="1272.02" dur="5.07">is very much you know probably a big</text>
  <text start="1273.94" dur="4.2">part of how subsequent corruption that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1277.09" dur="3.48">my personal opinion</text>

  <text start="1776.62" dur="6.71">eb-5 money and you realize that</text>
