  <text start="0.03" dur="4.89">Shalom and good morning this is Daniel</text>
  <text start="3.21" dur="4.92">John Lee with Torah restoration</text>
  <text start="4.92" dur="6.78">ministries it is the third day of the</text>
  <text start="8.13" dur="8.159">eighth Hebrew month it is Monday October</text>
  <text start="11.7" dur="8.4">the 23rd 2017 and just needed to make</text>
  <text start="16.289" dur="4.951">this video just to follow up with last</text>
  <text start="20.1" dur="4.56">night&amp;#39;s video that I made about</text>
  <text start="21.24" dur="4.89">delivering Rick and Sharon and Dale and</text>
  <text start="24.66" dur="6.48">raelynne and anyone else at Cornerstone</text>
  <text start="26.13" dur="6.66">in sin over to Satan hopefully they will</text>
  <text start="31.14" dur="3.89">eventually be brought to repentance</text>
  <text start="32.79" dur="4.56">through this it&amp;#39;s an extreme measure</text>
  <text start="35.03" dur="4.39">Apostle Paul doesn&amp;#39;t use it often I</text>
  <text start="37.35" dur="2.67">think it&amp;#39;s only recorded twice in the</text>
  <text start="39.42" dur="2.79">Brit hadashah</text>
  <text start="40.02" dur="3.57">where he does use this but but it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="42.21" dur="3.029">extreme measure to bring people to</text>
  <text start="43.59" dur="2.94">repentance and hopefully that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="45.239" dur="2.91">will happen I mean that&amp;#39;s my heart</text>
  <text start="46.53" dur="3.959">that&amp;#39;s what I want to see happen for</text>
  <text start="48.149" dur="4.311">Rick and his wife and Dale and his wife</text>
  <text start="50.489" dur="4.5">and those in sin at Cornerstone</text>
  <text start="52.46" dur="4.329">but I was talking to a brother this</text>
  <text start="54.989" dur="4.381">morning and and just really felt</text>
  <text start="56.789" dur="4.86">impressed in my spirit that despite this</text>
  <text start="59.37" dur="4.8">Rick is going to continue to harden his</text>
  <text start="61.649" dur="7.111">heart and continue in his unrepentant</text>
  <text start="64.17" dur="6.69">sin as as Dale and so what yeah I think</text>
  <text start="68.76" dur="8.88">is showing me as I&amp;#39;ve been praying and</text>
  <text start="70.86" dur="11.48">in the spirit excuse me is like King</text>
  <text start="77.64" dur="9.39">Saul basically Pastor Rick is King Saul</text>
  <text start="82.34" dur="7.3">Dale is of King Saul&amp;#39;s family their King</text>
  <text start="87.03" dur="5.4">Saul and yah eventually removed King</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="5.15">Saul now Saul was anointed by Yong who</text>
  <text start="92.43" dur="5.43">was called by yah but but Saul chose to</text>
  <text start="94.79" dur="5.079">rebel and and forsake his first love</text>
  <text start="97.86" dur="4.02">rather than to repent and come back to</text>
  <text start="99.869" dur="4.201">him and so an evil spirit was sent</text>
  <text start="101.88" dur="3.93">against him and eventually saw although</text>
  <text start="104.07" dur="3.93">yah gave him many chances to repent</text>
  <text start="105.81" dur="3.419">eventually solved took his own life and</text>
  <text start="108" dur="3.119">I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s gonna happen to Rick</text>
  <text start="109.229" dur="4.111">I think hopefully Rick and Dale will</text>
  <text start="111.119" dur="3.691">eventually repent but but I do believe</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="3.779">that they are king saw and that they</text>
  <text start="114.81" dur="5.28">will be removed from cornerstone in yaws</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="4.14">timing I am as King David I&amp;#39;m sort of</text>
  <text start="120.09" dur="2.959">out in the wilderness I&amp;#39;ve been put in</text>
  <text start="121.259" dur="5.341">exile and I&amp;#39;m in the wilderness you know</text>
  <text start="123.049" dur="7.33">and I do believe just because Yas puts</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="5.02">such an incredible love inside me for</text>
  <text start="130.379" dur="3.461">Cornerstone</text>
  <text start="131.62" dur="5.79">I mean I have never felt the love like I</text>
  <text start="133.84" dur="6.39">feel for that place for any congregation</text>
  <text start="137.41" dur="4.46">and that has to come from yon I deeply</text>
  <text start="140.23" dur="5.1">love those people so I also believe that</text>
  <text start="141.87" dur="6.31">once he removes Rick and Dale and their</text>
  <text start="145.33" dur="3.96">wives and once she removes every person</text>
  <text start="148.18" dur="4.02">at Cornerstone who has sinned their</text>
  <text start="149.29" dur="4.589">lives and once he breaks off this 501c3</text>
  <text start="152.2" dur="4.59">baptist thing that they still have on</text>
  <text start="153.879" dur="4.711">that building I do believe that like</text>
  <text start="156.79" dur="4.85">King David of old yo is gonna actually</text>
  <text start="158.59" dur="5.6">bring me back to Cornerstone and that I</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="6.76">will become the pastor of that place</text>
  <text start="164.19" dur="6.31">eventually so we&amp;#39;ll wait and see how</text>
  <text start="168.4" dur="4.44">that works out but uh trusting in yah</text>
  <text start="170.5" dur="4.2">and and just believing that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.84" dur="4.709">what&amp;#39;s gonna happen and I I think though</text>
  <text start="174.7" dur="5.28">that even when Rick and his wife and</text>
  <text start="177.549" dur="4.011">Dale and his wife and these sinners at</text>
  <text start="179.98" dur="4.14">Cornerstone even when they get removed</text>
  <text start="181.56" dur="4.03">they still may not repent but I think</text>
  <text start="184.12" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;ll at least start the humbling</text>
  <text start="185.59" dur="3.479">process and eventually bring them back</text>
  <text start="187.87" dur="4.08">to their first love</text>
  <text start="189.069" dur="4.081">so that encourages me hallelujah this is</text>
