  <text start="235.25" dur="9.51">ban me from that fellowship it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.19" dur="8.16">unbelievable it&amp;#39;s unbelievable there are</text>

  <text start="270.74" dur="10.05">all around all around it&amp;#39;s very sad but</text>
  <text start="279.169" dur="6.361">there&amp;#39;s a scripture I think that fits</text>
  <text start="280.79" dur="6.99">this it&amp;#39;s in Isaiah chapter 1 it says</text>
  <text start="285.53" dur="3.36">starting in verse 5 why should you be</text>

  <text start="292.22" dur="4.68">head is sick and the whole heart faint</text>
  <text start="294.19" dur="5.22">from the sole of the foot even unto the</text>
  <text start="296.9" dur="6.3">head there is no soundness in it but</text>
  <text start="299.41" dur="7.66">wounds and bruises and putrefying sores</text>
  <text start="303.2" dur="8.31">they have not been closed neither bound</text>
  <text start="307.07" dur="6.349">up neither mollified with ointment then</text>
  <text start="311.51" dur="4.839">there&amp;#39;s another scripture in Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="313.419" dur="5.24">says</text>
  <text start="316.349" dur="4.77">son of man go get the end of the house</text>
  <text start="318.659" dur="5.611">of Israel and speak with my words unto</text>

  <text start="348.899" dur="4.23">will not hearken unto me for all the</text>
  <text start="351.509" dur="5.19">house of Israel or impotent and</text>
  <text start="353.129" dur="5.49">hard-hearted and that&amp;#39;s what I see at</text>
