  <text start="90.42" dur="4.29">reflects their faith the impeachment of</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="4.11">Donald Trump is a significant event in</text>
  <text start="94.71" dur="4.92">the story about Republic it requires</text>
  <text start="96.78" dur="4.769">comment the typical Christianity today</text>
  <text start="99.63" dur="3.21">approaches to stay above the fray and</text>

  <text start="148.48" dur="3.63">president the Democrats have had it out</text>
  <text start="150.4" dur="3.75">for him from day one and therefore</text>
  <text start="152.11" dur="4.5">nearly everything they do is under a</text>
  <text start="154.15" dur="4.77">cloud of partisan suspicion this has led</text>
  <text start="156.61" dur="3.99">many to suspect not only motives but</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="4.11">facts in these recent impeachment</text>
  <text start="160.6" dur="4.71">hearings and no mr. Trump did not have a</text>
  <text start="163.03" dur="3.78">serious opportunity to offer his side of</text>
  <text start="165.31" dur="3.81">the story and the house hearings on</text>
  <text start="166.81" dur="4.83">Pietschmann but the facts and assistance</text>
  <text start="169.12" dur="4.05">are unambiguous the president United</text>
  <text start="171.64" dur="4.44">States attempted to use his political</text>
  <text start="173.17" dur="4.23">power to coerce a foreign leader to</text>
  <text start="176.08" dur="3.39">harass and discredit one of the</text>
  <text start="177.4" dur="3.72">president&amp;#39;s political opponents that is</text>
  <text start="179.47" dur="3.51">not only a violation of the Constitution</text>
  <text start="181.12" dur="5.07">more importantly it is profoundly</text>
  <text start="182.98" dur="6.86">immoral I&amp;#39;m gonna read this paragraph</text>
  <text start="186.19" dur="6.72">again this is from Christianity today a</text>
  <text start="189.84" dur="6.13">major evangelical Christian magazine</text>
  <text start="192.91" dur="5.52">says this but the facts in the instance</text>
  <text start="195.97" dur="4.829">are unambiguous the President of the</text>
  <text start="198.43" dur="5.07">United States attempted to use his</text>
  <text start="200.799" dur="5.731">political power power to coerce a</text>
  <text start="203.5" dur="5.64">foreign leader no he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="206.53" dur="5.13">both transcripts that President Trump</text>
  <text start="209.14" dur="5.01">released showed that he did not do this</text>
  <text start="211.66" dur="4.71">to harass and discredit one of the</text>
  <text start="214.15" dur="8.28">president&amp;#39;s political opponents you mean</text>
  <text start="216.37" dur="7.86">Joe Biden the Satanic pedophile that is</text>
  <text start="222.43" dur="3.42">not only a violation of the Constitution</text>
  <text start="224.23" dur="4.41">more importantly just profoundly immoral</text>
  <text start="225.85" dur="5.22">so President Trump wants to hold a</text>
  <text start="228.64" dur="5.04">satanic pedophile Joe Biden in a son</text>
  <text start="231.07" dur="5.94">Hunter Biden who are guilty of major</text>
  <text start="233.68" dur="6.179">major money fraud and bribery through</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="4.5">Ukraine and Christianity today is saying</text>
  <text start="239.859" dur="5.69">that President Trump violated the</text>
  <text start="241.51" dur="11.819">Constitution and it&amp;#39;s profoundly immoral</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="9.581">this is this is beyond anything what is</text>
  <text start="253.329" dur="4.321">Christianity today hiding is my question</text>
  <text start="255.13" dur="5.47">what are they hiding</text>
  <text start="257.65" dur="5.92">well I&amp;#39;ve reported that newly Graham is</text>
  <text start="260.6" dur="5.88">a serial pedophile or was assertive</text>
  <text start="263.57" dur="4.35">pedophile he founded this magazine so</text>
  <text start="266.48" dur="3.81">maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised about</text>
  <text start="267.92" dur="4.5">this although I know Franklin Graham is</text>
  <text start="270.29" dur="7.7">out there today defending President</text>
  <text start="272.42" dur="7.71">Trump and defending President Trump and</text>
  <text start="277.99" dur="5.14">you know basically saying that his</text>
  <text start="280.13" dur="4.86">father would never say this but this is</text>
  <text start="283.13" dur="3.93">what we&amp;#39;re seeing from Christianity</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="5.15">today where they&amp;#39;re actually saying that</text>
  <text start="287.06" dur="7.61">what President Trump has done is immoral</text>
  <text start="290.14" dur="7.18">they&amp;#39;ve called evil good and good evil</text>
  <text start="294.67" dur="4.36">this is the state of the church in the</text>
  <text start="297.32" dur="3.63">United States right now I mean this is</text>
  <text start="299.03" dur="4.53">the state of evangelicals right now this</text>
  <text start="300.95" dur="6.09">is how twisted things have gotten or</text>
  <text start="303.56" dur="5.25">they can&amp;#39;t even discern right look I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="307.04" dur="4.47">not defending President Trump&amp;#39;s past</text>
  <text start="308.81" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;ve all had past that the Messiah has</text>
  <text start="311.51" dur="5.01">had to redeem us from and help us to</text>
  <text start="313.88" dur="5.31">overcome we&amp;#39;ve all had that but to say</text>
  <text start="316.52" dur="4.95">that president truck wanting to hold Joe</text>
  <text start="319.19" dur="3.53">and hunter Biden accountable for their</text>
  <text start="321.47" dur="5.07">actions</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="7.03">my goodness obviously Christianity today</text>
  <text start="326.54" dur="4.26">does not follow q actually more to the</text>
  <text start="329.75" dur="4.56">point they don&amp;#39;t even follow the Holy</text>
  <text start="330.8" dur="6.06">Spirit there&amp;#39;s an article that was</text>
  <text start="334.31" dur="4.65">written in response to this flagship</text>
  <text start="336.86" dur="5.04">evangelical magazine Christianity today</text>
  <text start="338.96" dur="4.47">calls for Trump&amp;#39;s removal I&amp;#39;m gonna just</text>

  <text start="347.36" dur="4.35">removal from office Thursday evening</text>
  <text start="349.57" dur="3.97">Christianity today which was founded by</text>
  <text start="351.71" dur="4.02">Reverend Billy Graham published a column</text>

  <text start="359.87" dur="3.45">Democrats have had it out friend from</text>
  <text start="361.37" dur="3.15">day one and therefore nearly everything</text>
  <text start="363.32" dur="4.08">they do is under a cloud of suspicion</text>
  <text start="364.52" dur="4.68">mr. golly speaking for the magazine said</text>
  <text start="367.4" dur="3.69">those clouds and that animus are no</text>
  <text start="369.2" dur="3.42">longer enough to grant mr. Trump the</text>
  <text start="371.09" dur="3.21">benefit of the doubt because of his good</text>
  <text start="372.62" dur="4.16">policies on such matters as abortion</text>
  <text start="374.3" dur="4.86">religious liberty and federal judgeships</text>

  <text start="392.529" dur="7.711">any case I think that it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="396.909" dur="10.19">obvious that the evangelicals that many</text>

  <text start="407.099" dur="5.921">they are I don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re</text>
