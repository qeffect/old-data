  <text start="4.74" dur="7.08">shabbat shalom Twilight is settling now</text>
  <text start="8.22" dur="7.379">on Portland Oregon here on the 21st</text>
  <text start="11.82" dur="8.64">going into the 22nd day of Zen may the</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="7.711">evening of May the 31st 2013 and I have</text>
  <text start="20.46" dur="6">two Psalms that I have written over the</text>
  <text start="23.31" dur="9.21">past 48 hours that I would like to share</text>
  <text start="26.46" dur="9.66">as some of you may know last October</text>
  <text start="32.52" dur="7.25">I had a very painful court date in which</text>
  <text start="36.12" dur="6.63">my ex-wife hired a very crafty lawyer</text>
  <text start="39.77" dur="4.9">that resulted in me losing any</text>
  <text start="42.75" dur="4.53">possibility of having any type of</text>
  <text start="44.67" dur="4.95">contact with my six precious children</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="7.23">who might I love more than life itself</text>
  <text start="49.62" dur="6.93">I&amp;#39;d miss very much and you know I had</text>
  <text start="54.51" dur="6.66">the choice of whether I was gonna become</text>
  <text start="56.55" dur="6.499">bitter against Yahweh allow myself to</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="4.97">become broken and spirit over this</text>
  <text start="63.049" dur="7.301">because it was a very painful thing and</text>
  <text start="66.14" dur="6.549">yet I have written a song it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="4.769">entitled a psalm of Daniel II concerning</text>
  <text start="72.689" dur="9.121">the loss of his children and the time</text>
  <text start="75.119" dur="10.32">from 10 2012 through 5 2013 so from last</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="5.61">October until the present and I want to</text>
  <text start="85.439" dur="3.54">share this song in the hopes that it</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="5.22">will touch some of you out there in</text>
  <text start="88.979" dur="7.041">YouTube world on this precious shabbat</text>
  <text start="92.64" dur="6.659">shalom and the song begins like this</text>
  <text start="96.02" dur="7.08">what is this this breaking of the</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="7.35">darkness this brilliance of yas light</text>
  <text start="103.1" dur="5.769">shining through turning even the gloomy</text>
  <text start="106.649" dur="5.851">rain a golden mist</text>
  <text start="108.869" dur="6.36">how could it be that such pain wracked</text>
  <text start="112.5" dur="6.909">my heart through which such joy now</text>
  <text start="115.229" dur="7.03">flows when sorrows turned to laughter</text>
  <text start="119.409" dur="6.84">leaping into dancing heaven kisses earth</text>
  <text start="122.259" dur="7.021">and for that eternal age we earn yet how</text>
  <text start="126.249" dur="5.731">is it even now while still in this</text>
  <text start="129.28" dur="5.94">fallen world still within a corruptible</text>
  <text start="131.98" dur="5.93">body that elusive joy of an age not yet</text>
  <text start="135.22" dur="7.049">arrived pours through me presently</text>
  <text start="137.91" dur="7.6">happiness uncontained gilding everything</text>
  <text start="142.269" dur="6.091">I see sweetening every moment his</text>
  <text start="145.51" dur="6.63">presence pours through me like liquid</text>
  <text start="148.36" dur="6.9">gold and the more he draws near the more</text>
  <text start="152.14" dur="6.27">I shout an acclamation back to him he</text>
  <text start="155.26" dur="4.71">pours his praise into me and back out as</text>
  <text start="158.41" dur="5.25">praises go from my lips</text>
  <text start="159.97" dur="7.71">and so yea is all in all and I but a</text>
  <text start="163.66" dur="6.87">vessel how is it Those stripped of all I</text>
  <text start="167.68" dur="5.85">hold dear desecrated with pain</text>
  <text start="170.53" dur="7.26">unbearable and anguish too great for my</text>
  <text start="173.53" dur="8.25">soul that in so great a despair this joy</text>
  <text start="177.79" dur="7.71">unquenchable blossomed forth can pain</text>
  <text start="181.78" dur="6.59">and sorrow loss and heartache really</text>
  <text start="185.5" dur="6.599">brings such unfathomable happiness and</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="9.25">then I see it like a single crystal</text>
  <text start="192.099" dur="8">droplet of rain so clear so pure it is</text>
  <text start="197.62" dur="6.119">not the mere pain that brought such joy</text>
  <text start="200.099" dur="6.491">but yahshua who brought me through the</text>
  <text start="203.739" dur="6.271">pain through the shame through the</text>
  <text start="206.59" dur="7.739">blackness and despair to find the crown</text>
  <text start="210.01" dur="9.03">the jeweled with tender love and upon my</text>
  <text start="214.329" dur="7.671">head I wear Thanksgiving now cannot be</text>
  <text start="219.04" dur="6.36">held back like a rushing raging river</text>
  <text start="222" dur="6.43">for everything I now give thanks because</text>
  <text start="225.4" dur="7.8">I see he is everywhere even in the pain</text>
  <text start="228.43" dur="7.679">in the sorrow in the loss so that Satan</text>
  <text start="233.2" dur="7.86">fling his worst because no matter what</text>
  <text start="236.109" dur="7.801">evil comes yas love shines through so</text>
  <text start="241.06" dur="6.269">that even the enemy is only used to</text>
  <text start="243.91" dur="4.57">bring forth yas greater good oh how I</text>
  <text start="247.329" dur="4.33">see it</text>
  <text start="248.48" dur="6.81">now I see it what beautiful paradox is</text>
  <text start="251.659" dur="6.211">this in greater despair in greater</text>
