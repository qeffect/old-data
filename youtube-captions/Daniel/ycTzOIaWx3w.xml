  <text start="2.449" dur="6.881">December the 9th 2019 I&amp;#39;m here at the</text>
  <text start="5.94" dur="7.199">Seattle Airport it&amp;#39;s the 12th or 13th</text>
  <text start="9.33" dur="5.88">day of the 90 per month anyway</text>
  <text start="13.139" dur="3.39">I&amp;#39;m sort of making a impromptu video</text>
  <text start="15.21" dur="3.81">here if you&amp;#39;re new to my channel my name</text>
  <text start="16.529" dur="4.201">is Daniel II live in Juneau Alaska I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="19.02" dur="3.81">just coming back from a Q conference</text>
  <text start="20.73" dur="3.9">that I hosted in New Jersey which was an</text>
  <text start="22.83" dur="4.529">absolute success and I also got to spend</text>
  <text start="24.63" dur="4.92">quite a bit of time with the older man</text>
  <text start="27.359" dur="3.901">who helps me lead my prayer team he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="29.55" dur="2.939">been leaving my prayer team helping me</text>
  <text start="31.26" dur="3.27">lead my prayer team for the last year</text>
  <text start="32.489" dur="3.901">and a half John I got to spend a lot of</text>
  <text start="34.53" dur="3.42">good quality time with him so I&amp;#39;m here</text>
  <text start="36.39" dur="2.849">in a layover and see how I flew from</text>
  <text start="37.95" dur="3.24">field office in Seattle I&amp;#39;m here in</text>
  <text start="39.239" dur="5.611">layover and headed back to Juneau later</text>
  <text start="41.19" dur="5.22">later today but the IG report was just</text>
  <text start="44.85" dur="5.549">released and I wanted to just to</text>
  <text start="46.41" dur="6.36">highlight some some important things</text>
  <text start="50.399" dur="4.711">about this I went to the conclusion of</text>
  <text start="52.77" dur="5.309">the report which is where the real meat</text>
  <text start="55.11" dur="4.62">is and it says nevertheless we have</text>
  <text start="58.079" dur="3.771">found that members of the crossfire</text>
  <text start="59.73" dur="5.219">hurricane team failed to meet the basic</text>
  <text start="61.85" dur="5.32">obligations obligation to ensure that</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="5.091">the Carter page vice&amp;#39; applications were</text>
  <text start="67.17" dur="5.4">scrupulously accurate who identified</text>
  <text start="70.04" dur="4.689">significant and actresses and omissions</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="4.799">in each of the four applications seven</text>
  <text start="74.729" dur="5.791">in the first Feist application and a</text>
  <text start="77.369" dur="5.401">total of 17 by the first renewal</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="4.08">application there&amp;#39;s that number 17 again</text>
  <text start="82.77" dur="4.38">right q is the 17th letter of the</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="5.85">alphabet and 17 in Scripture always</text>
  <text start="87.15" dur="6.27">means victory and prevail it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="90.45" dur="5.129">cool for example the crossfire hurricane</text>
  <text start="93.42" dur="6.089">team obtained information from Steele&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.579" dur="5.61">primary sub source in January 2017 that</text>
  <text start="99.509" dur="3.811">raised significant questions about the</text>
  <text start="101.189" dur="4.411">reliability of the steel reporting that</text>
  <text start="103.32" dur="2.7">was used in the Carter page by SAP Lakai</text>
  <text start="105.6" dur="2.19">shion&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="3.27">but members of the crossfire hurricane</text>
  <text start="107.79" dur="3.21">team failed to share the information</text>
  <text start="109.29" dur="3.6">with the department and it was therefore</text>
  <text start="111" dur="4.17">omitted from the three renewal</text>
  <text start="112.89" dur="4.079">applications all of the applications</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="4.489">also admitted information the FBI too</text>
  <text start="116.969" dur="4.311">had obtained from another US government</text>
  <text start="119.659" dur="3.871">detailing its prior relationship with</text>
  <text start="121.28" dur="4.259">page including that page have been</text>
  <text start="123.53" dur="4.949">approved as an operational contact for</text>
  <text start="125.539" dur="4.83">the other agency from 2008 to 2013 and</text>
  <text start="128.479" dur="4.171">that page had provided information to</text>
  <text start="130.369" dur="3.84">the other agency concerning his prior</text>
  <text start="132.65" dur="3.27">contacts with certain Russian</text>
  <text start="134.209" dur="3.691">intelligence officers one of which</text>
  <text start="135.92" dur="5.069">overlapped with facts asserted in the</text>
  <text start="137.9" dur="5.76">Feist application as a result of the 17</text>
  <text start="140.989" dur="4.89">significant inaccuracies and omissions</text>
  <text start="143.66" dur="4.23">that we identified relevant information</text>
  <text start="145.879" dur="4.531">was not shared with and consequently not</text>
  <text start="147.89" dur="4.59">considered by important Department</text>
  <text start="150.41" dur="4.079">decision-makers and the court and the</text>
  <text start="152.48" dur="3.599">FISA applications made it appear because</text>
  <text start="154.489" dur="3.571">of the evidence supporting probable</text>
  <text start="156.079" dur="2.49">cause was stronger than was actually the</text>
  <text start="158.06" dur="3.149">case</text>
  <text start="158.569" dur="4.92">we also found basic fundamental and</text>
  <text start="161.209" dur="5.131">serious errors during the completion of</text>
  <text start="163.489" dur="4.59">the FBI&amp;#39;s factual accuracy reviews known</text>
  <text start="166.34" dur="2.85">as the woods procedures which are</text>
  <text start="168.079" dur="3.03">designed to ensure that visa</text>
  <text start="169.19" dur="4.59">applications contain a full and accurate</text>
  <text start="171.109" dur="4.561">presentation of the facts we do not</text>
  <text start="173.78" dur="3.66">speculate whether the correction of any</text>
  <text start="175.67" dur="3.75">particular misstatement or omission or</text>
  <text start="177.44" dur="3.299">some combination thereof would have</text>
  <text start="179.42" dur="3.03">resulted that will do an outcome</text>
  <text start="180.739" dur="3.241">nevertheless the department&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.45" dur="3.24">decision-makers and the court should</text>
  <text start="183.98" dur="3.479">have been given complete and accurate</text>
  <text start="185.69" dur="3.419">information so that they could</text>
  <text start="187.459" dur="3.631">meaningfully evaluate probable cause</text>
  <text start="189.109" dur="3.271">before authorizing the surveillance of a</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="3.899">u.s. person associated with a</text>
  <text start="192.38" dur="4.5">presidential campaign that did not occur</text>
  <text start="194.989" dur="4.051">and as a result the surveillance of</text>
  <text start="196.88" dur="4.53">Carter page continued even as the FBI</text>
  <text start="199.04" dur="4.41">gathered information that weekend at the</text>
  <text start="201.41" dur="4.979">assessment probable cause and made the</text>
  <text start="203.45" dur="4.289">visa applications less accurate we</text>
  <text start="206.389" dur="2.94">determined that the inaccuracies and</text>
  <text start="207.739" dur="3.451">emissions we identified in the</text>
  <text start="209.329" dur="3.451">applications resulted from case agents</text>
  <text start="211.19" dur="3.359">providing wrong or incomplete</text>
  <text start="212.78" dur="4.26">information to department attorneys and</text>
  <text start="214.549" dur="4.951">failing to identify important issues or</text>
  <text start="217.04" dur="5.22">discussion moreover we concluded that</text>
  <text start="219.5" dur="4.799">case agents and SSAS did not give</text>
  <text start="222.26" dur="4.14">appropriate attention to facts that cut</text>
  <text start="224.299" dur="3.601">against probable cause and that as the</text>
  <text start="226.4" dur="2.97">investigation progressed and more</text>
  <text start="227.9" dur="2.97">information tended to undermine or</text>
  <text start="229.37" dur="2.28">weaken assertions in the FISA</text>
  <text start="230.87" dur="3.42">applications</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="3.989">the agents and SSAS did not accept we</text>
  <text start="234.29" dur="4.379">assess the information supporting</text>
  <text start="235.639" dur="5.1">probable cause further the agents and</text>
  <text start="238.669" dur="4.29">SSAS did not follow or even appear to</text>
  <text start="240.739" dur="4.351">know certain basic requirements in the</text>
  <text start="242.959" dur="4.5">woods procedures although we did not</text>
  <text start="245.09" dur="4.2">find documentary or testimonial</text>
  <text start="247.459" dur="3.931">of intentional misconduct from the part</text>
  <text start="249.29" dur="3.72">of the case agents who assisted NS DS</text>
  <text start="251.39" dur="3.42">office of intelligence preparing the</text>
  <text start="253.01" dur="3.3">applications or the agents and</text>
  <text start="254.81" dur="3.51">supervisors who performed at the woods</text>
  <text start="256.31" dur="3.899">procedures we also did not receive</text>
  <text start="258.32" dur="4.379">satisfactory explanations for the errors</text>
  <text start="260.209" dur="4.351">or missing information we found that the</text>
  <text start="262.699" dur="3.75">offered explanations for these serious</text>
  <text start="264.56" dur="3.63">errors did not excuse them or the</text>
  <text start="266.449" dur="5">repeated failures to ensure the accuracy</text>
  <text start="268.19" dur="5.699">of information presented by to the FISC</text>
  <text start="271.449" dur="4.421">we are deeply concerned that so many</text>
  <text start="273.889" dur="3.9">basic and fundamental errors were made</text>
  <text start="275.87" dur="4.079">by three separate hand-picked</text>
  <text start="277.789" dur="4.951">investigative teams on one of the most</text>
  <text start="279.949" dur="4.051">sensitive FBI investigations after the</text>
  <text start="282.74" dur="3.69">matter had been briefed to the highest</text>
  <text start="284" dur="4.08">levels within the FBI even though the</text>
  <text start="286.43" dur="3.769">information sought through use of FISA</text>
  <text start="288.08" dur="5.339">authorities relating to an ongoing</text>
  <text start="290.199" dur="5.44">presidential campaign and even though</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="3.601">and even though those involved the</text>
  <text start="295.639" dur="3.06">investigation knew that their actions</text>
  <text start="297.02" dur="3.929">were likely to be subjected to close</text>
  <text start="298.699" dur="4.53">scrutiny we believe this circumstance</text>
  <text start="300.949" dur="4.261">reflects a failure not just by those who</text>
  <text start="303.229" dur="4.351">prepared the FISA applications but also</text>
  <text start="305.21" dur="4.28">by the managers and supervisors in the</text>
  <text start="307.58" dur="5.22">crossfire hurricane chain-of-command</text>
  <text start="309.49" dur="5.97">including FBI senior officials who are</text>
  <text start="312.8" dur="6.92">briefed as the investigation progressed</text>
  <text start="315.46" dur="6.699">senior officials think James Comey</text>
  <text start="319.72" dur="4.09">however especially in the FBI&amp;#39;s most</text>
  <text start="322.159" dur="3.271">sensitive and high-priority matters and</text>
  <text start="323.81" dur="3.9">especially when seeking court permission</text>
  <text start="325.43" dur="4.59">to use an intrusive tool such as a fysop</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="4.41">order it is incumbent upon the entire</text>
  <text start="330.02" dur="4.44">chain of command including senior</text>
  <text start="332.12" dur="3.45">officials to take the necessary steps to</text>
  <text start="334.46" dur="2.19">ensure that they are sufficiently</text>
  <text start="335.57" dur="3.24">familiar with the facts and</text>
  <text start="336.65" dur="4.32">circumstances supporting and potentially</text>
  <text start="338.81" dur="3.419">undermining a FISA application in order</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="2.97">to provide effective oversight</text>
  <text start="342.229" dur="4.051">consistent with their level of</text>
  <text start="343.94" dur="3.84">supervisory responsibilities such</text>
  <text start="346.28" dur="3.509">oversight requires great greater</text>
  <text start="347.78" dur="3.96">familiarity the facts that we saw in</text>
  <text start="349.789" dur="3.931">this review were time and again during</text>
  <text start="351.74" dur="4.64">oh I G interviews FBI managers</text>
  <text start="353.72" dur="4.77">supervisors and senior officials</text>
  <text start="356.38" dur="3.46">displayed a lack of understanding or</text>
  <text start="358.49" dur="2.85">awareness of important information</text>
  <text start="359.84" dur="7.43">concerning many of the problems we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="361.34" dur="8.669">identified so now I&amp;#39;ve said before that</text>
  <text start="367.27" dur="4.3">what my name Intel source said and of</text>
  <text start="370.009" dur="3.421">course he&amp;#39;s been off calm since November</text>
  <text start="371.57" dur="3.2">12th but one of the last things he told</text>
  <text start="373.43" dur="3.829">me as he said that</text>
  <text start="374.77" dur="5.16">this ID report was gonna be released and</text>
  <text start="377.259" dur="6.69">this was only gonna basically talk about</text>
  <text start="379.93" dur="6.44">Spygate and I just read here these</text>
  <text start="383.949" dur="6.271">seventeen errors of these seventeen</text>
  <text start="386.37" dur="6.46">anomalies that the IG report found which</text>
  <text start="390.22" dur="5.069">proves that not only lower-level agents</text>
  <text start="392.83" dur="4.44">but up to up the chain of command it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.289" dur="5.25">actually naming it&amp;#39;s saying senior FBI</text>
  <text start="397.27" dur="5.19">agents were involved in these you know</text>
  <text start="400.539" dur="3.121">basically what Horowitz is saying is</text>
  <text start="402.46" dur="3.269">these are crimes I mean these are</text>
  <text start="403.66" dur="5.909">serious errors that have completely</text>
  <text start="405.729" dur="5.881">misused the FISA Court but that this was</text>
  <text start="409.569" dur="3.6">just gonna be a mouse spy gate of course</text>
  <text start="411.61" dur="3.149">we know Horowitz has no authority he</text>
  <text start="413.169" dur="4.56">doesn&amp;#39;t have a badge not able to arrest</text>
  <text start="414.759" dur="5.041">anyone but what my Navy Intel source</text>
  <text start="417.729" dur="4.141">said was that after this is released now</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="4.98">bar is gonna come with a report directly</text>
  <text start="421.87" dur="4.47">from him and that reports gonna be</text>
  <text start="424.78" dur="4.109">what&amp;#39;s gonna set off a political</text>
  <text start="426.34" dur="7.53">earthquake in DC and start the mass</text>
  <text start="428.889" dur="7.5">arrests I think what this IG report has</text>
  <text start="433.87" dur="5.789">done is it&amp;#39;s certainly provided the</text>
  <text start="436.389" dur="7.731">framework and the launching pad that</text>
  <text start="439.659" dur="7.411">bill bar now has all the public can see</text>
  <text start="444.12" dur="4.51">bill bar now has the ability to not</text>
  <text start="447.07" dur="4.74">release his report which will then say</text>
  <text start="448.63" dur="5.969">okay so Horowitz identified these 17</text>
  <text start="451.81" dur="5.55">things that were done wrong during this</text>
  <text start="454.599" dur="4.261">whole process of illegally invading</text>
  <text start="457.36" dur="3.27">Trump&amp;#39;s campaign and trying to</text>
  <text start="458.86" dur="4.109">investigate him and spy on Hammonds and</text>
  <text start="460.63" dur="4.289">spy on people related in to his campaign</text>
  <text start="462.969" dur="3.48">so now we&amp;#39;re gonna now we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="464.919" dur="2.851">actually go after these people for blood</text>
  <text start="466.449" dur="5.31">now we&amp;#39;re actually go after these people</text>
  <text start="467.77" dur="6.179">with the arrests I knew that nothing</text>
  <text start="471.759" dur="3.69">about satanic pedophilia obviously was</text>
  <text start="473.949" dur="5.97">gonna be in this report this is strictly</text>
  <text start="475.449" dur="5.97">dealing with with Spygate right but the</text>
  <text start="479.919" dur="3.72">report that bill Barr supposed to come</text>
  <text start="481.419" dur="5.671">out with directly from him Durham is</text>
  <text start="483.639" dur="5.25">working on in which a lot of these grand</text>
  <text start="487.09" dur="3.56">juries have been secretly paneled and</text>
  <text start="488.889" dur="3.201">that we don&amp;#39;t know about</text>
  <text start="490.65" dur="3.03">this is where the indictments are</text>
  <text start="492.09" dur="3.09">supposed to be unsealed this is where</text>
  <text start="493.68" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re actually going to start bringing</text>
  <text start="495.18" dur="4.56">in the whole Epstein information to</text>
  <text start="497.46" dur="6.45">collide with the information that was</text>
  <text start="499.74" dur="6.12">provided in this IG report so so it but</text>
  <text start="503.91" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s awesome I mean this this report is</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="4.05">awesome it&amp;#39;s definitely not a nothing</text>
  <text start="508.14" dur="4.02">burger you know to say that there&amp;#39;s 17</text>
  <text start="509.91" dur="7.68">significant inaccuracies and omissions</text>
  <text start="512.16" dur="8.19">and that senior senior people within the</text>
  <text start="517.59" dur="4.17">FBI are responsible for this I mean</text>
  <text start="520.35" dur="3.57">basically you know we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="521.76" dur="4.17">Comey we&amp;#39;re talking about Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="523.92" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re talking about these people who</text>
  <text start="525.93" dur="5.25">were you know senior officials that were</text>
  <text start="528.48" dur="4.35">involved in this stuff and you know they</text>
  <text start="531.18" dur="3.36">start from the bottom and then they work</text>
  <text start="532.83" dur="4.62">their way up they work their way up</text>
  <text start="534.54" dur="4.5">so anyway I&amp;#39;m sort of traveling here so</text>
  <text start="537.45" dur="2.46">this is not the probably my best video</text>
  <text start="539.04" dur="3.72">but I just wanted to get this</text>
  <text start="539.91" dur="4.98">information out here because it&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="542.76" dur="4.89">report I just wanted to go for the most</text>
  <text start="544.89" dur="5.61">important information here to get this</text>
  <text start="547.65" dur="4.11">out so I forgot to do my introduction</text>
  <text start="550.5" dur="3.12">but if you&amp;#39;re new to my channel my name</text>
  <text start="551.76" dur="3.87">is Daniel Lee I again I normally live in</text>
