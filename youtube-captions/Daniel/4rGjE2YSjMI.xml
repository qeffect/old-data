  <text start="30.449" dur="5.401">when you read Ezekiel 40 through the end</text>

  <text start="57.69" dur="4.47">Yahweh Yahshua these are the ordinances</text>
  <text start="60.18" dur="4.019">of the altar in the day when they shall</text>
  <text start="62.16" dur="4.38">make it to offer burnt offerings thereof</text>
  <text start="64.199" dur="3.931">and to sprinkle blood there on and you</text>

  <text start="79.35" dur="3.72">upon the board around about the show you</text>
  <text start="81.42" dur="4.019">cleanse and purge it so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="3.689">cleansing and purging the temple that</text>
  <text start="85.439" dur="2.701">should make you think of Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="86.759" dur="4.801">because Hanukkah is all about cleansing</text>
  <text start="88.14" dur="5.31">the temple now listen to this thou shalt</text>
  <text start="91.56" dur="3.269">take the book also the sin offering and</text>
  <text start="93.45" dur="3.209">you shall burn it in the appointed place</text>
  <text start="94.829" dur="4.08">of the house without the sanctuary and</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="3.991">so that&amp;#39;s the first day then on the</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="3.39">second day you should offer a kid of the</text>
  <text start="100.65" dur="4.469">goats without blemish first an offering</text>
  <text start="102.299" dur="4.231">and then you go and it talks about when</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="3.481">you&amp;#39;ve made an end of cleansing it you</text>
  <text start="106.53" dur="4.08">shall offer a bullock without blemish a</text>
  <text start="108.6" dur="3.75">rama the flock without money you shall</text>
  <text start="110.61" dur="3.36">offer them before Yahweh and the</text>
  <text start="112.35" dur="3.03">pre-show cast salt upon them and they</text>
  <text start="113.97" dur="3.84">shall offer them up for a burnt offering</text>
  <text start="115.38" dur="4.26">unto yahweh then so that was the first</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="3.989">day second day says seven days you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="5.13">going to be doing this seven days you</text>
  <text start="121.799" dur="4.89">shall prepare every day a goat for a sin</text>
  <text start="124.77" dur="3.84">offering they should also prepare a</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="2.691">young Bullock and a ram out of the flock</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="2.99">without blemish</text>
  <text start="129.38" dur="3.96">seven days they shall purge the altar</text>
  <text start="131.6" dur="3.93">and purify it and they shall consecrate</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="3.84">themselves so now we have seven days of</text>
  <text start="135.53" dur="4.74">cleansing and purification I listen to</text>
  <text start="137.18" dur="5.49">this this is the last verse verse 27 and</text>
  <text start="140.27" dur="5.49">when these seven days are expired it</text>
  <text start="142.67" dur="5.34">shall be that upon the eighth day and so</text>
  <text start="145.76" dur="3.72">forward the priest shall make your burnt</text>
  <text start="148.01" dur="3.75">offerings upon the altar and your</text>
  <text start="149.48" dur="5.7">previous offerings and I will accept you</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="4.95">says Yahweh Yahshua so we have seven</text>
  <text start="155.18" dur="4.92">days of cleansing and then the eighth</text>
  <text start="156.71" dur="5.55">day by the eighth day the the temple has</text>
  <text start="160.1" dur="5.04">been fully cleansed and then he says he</text>
  <text start="162.26" dur="5.37">will accept the offerings on the altar</text>
  <text start="165.14" dur="3.9">so this is an eight day feast it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="167.63" dur="3.15">about cleansing the temple I have</text>
  <text start="169.04" dur="4.47">absolutely no doubt in my mind that</text>
  <text start="170.78" dur="5.31">Ezekiel 43 is referencing Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="173.51" dur="4.26">because Hanukkah is is the time we</text>
  <text start="176.09" dur="3.3">celebrate the cleansing of the temple</text>
  <text start="177.77" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s what the Maccabees did it took</text>
  <text start="179.39" dur="3.33">them eight days when you go through the</text>
  <text start="181.43" dur="3.12">book of Maccabees it took them eight</text>
  <text start="182.72" dur="4.17">days to cleanse the temple of course</text>
  <text start="184.55" dur="4.83">Yahshua celebrated this in John 10 22</text>
  <text start="186.89" dur="5.88">and I believe this is referring to the</text>
  <text start="189.38" dur="5.13">Hanukkah in 2017 after Yahshua has</text>
  <text start="192.77" dur="4.2">returned and power and glory from the</text>
  <text start="194.51" dur="6.6">sky he first he took us up to be with</text>
  <text start="196.97" dur="5.58">him on yom teruah 2017 we then go to the</text>
  <text start="201.11" dur="5.13">wedding stuff for the land we come back</text>
  <text start="202.55" dur="5.9">on yom kippur 2017 he and flaming fire</text>
  <text start="206.24" dur="4.56">destroys the son of perdition and then</text>
  <text start="208.45" dur="4.24">for Hanukkah that year a couple months</text>
  <text start="210.8" dur="4.08">later after the fall feasts I think this</text>
  <text start="212.69" dur="4.17">is what occurs yah has his priest</text>
  <text start="214.88" dur="3.78">cleanse this temple that had been</text>
  <text start="216.86" dur="4.65">defiled by the Antichrist that had been</text>
  <text start="218.66" dur="4.44">misused or what not and he cleanses it</text>
  <text start="221.51" dur="4.11">and then on the eighth day these</text>
  <text start="223.1" dur="5.1">sacrifices are now appropriate he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="225.62" dur="4.14">accept them and we know that the</text>
  <text start="228.2" dur="3.18">sacrifices will be done during the</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="3.9">millennial kingdom because in Zechariah</text>
  <text start="231.38" dur="4.11">14 as well as here in Ezekiel it talks</text>
  <text start="233.66" dur="3.84">about these sacrifices being done for</text>
  <text start="235.49" dur="4.71">that thousand years of course they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="237.5" dur="4.74">replace what Yahshua did they just point</text>
  <text start="240.2" dur="4.16">back there a memorial back toward what</text>
  <text start="242.24" dur="4.98">Yahshua has already done on the cross</text>
  <text start="244.36" dur="4.93">just like in Old Testament times the</text>
  <text start="247.22" dur="4.739">sacrifices pointed toward them and this</text>
  <text start="249.29" dur="4.44">again lines up right with Matthew 5 17</text>
  <text start="251.959" dur="4.231">through 20 where Yahshua says until the</text>
  <text start="253.73" dur="6.03">heavens and earth pass away not one jot</text>
  <text start="256.19" dur="5.199">or one tittle will passionate aura so I</text>
  <text start="259.76" dur="4.899">just think this is beautiful I</text>
  <text start="261.389" dur="4.68">seen Hanukkah in Ezekiel 43 and I just</text>
  <text start="264.659" dur="4.53">wanted to share that with everyone i</text>
