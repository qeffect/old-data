  <text start="94.77" dur="4.139">commandments given to Israel now of</text>
  <text start="97.68" dur="3.299">course there are certain Commandments</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="5.67">that cannot be done in our present day</text>
  <text start="100.979" dur="5.401">exile in Babylon and will not be done</text>
  <text start="104.579" dur="4.32">until after the resurrection after we</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="4.05">get caught up to be with Jesus and then</text>
  <text start="108.899" dur="4.08">return to earth to rule and reign with</text>
  <text start="110.43" dur="4.82">him over those who survive the Great</text>
  <text start="112.979" dur="2.271">Tribulation</text>
  <text start="115.93" dur="7.11">but as many of the commandments as we</text>
  <text start="118.72" dur="7.89">can we pursue just like many thousands</text>
  <text start="123.04" dur="5.28">of years ago Daniel and Babylon he you</text>
  <text start="126.61" dur="3.149">know he couldn&amp;#39;t do anything regarding</text>
  <text start="128.32" dur="3.63">like he couldn&amp;#39;t go keep the Feast of</text>
  <text start="129.759" dur="4.011">the temple because well quite frankly</text>
  <text start="131.95" dur="4.11">the temple had been destroyed and</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="4.03">Jerusalem had been ransacked and Daniel</text>
  <text start="136.06" dur="4.98">was in Babel but he did all that he</text>
  <text start="137.8" dur="6.12">could we know for example that he kept</text>
  <text start="141.04" dur="5.55">the Levitical eleven laws he did all</text>
  <text start="143.92" dur="4.319">that he could out of a heart of love for</text>
  <text start="146.59" dur="4.369">yah and that is the true gospel that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.239" dur="7.131">what&amp;#39;s talked about Hebrews eight</text>
  <text start="150.959" dur="7.451">hallelujah Hebrews eight which says that</text>
  <text start="155.37" dur="5.77">through the blood of Messiah and by his</text>
  <text start="158.41" dur="4.38">spirit he writes his Torah his</text>
  <text start="161.14" dur="3.27">instructions his commandments on our</text>
  <text start="162.79" dur="5.84">hearts our minds he gives us an inward</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="6.81">desire to obey the very law that we once</text>
  <text start="168.63" dur="4.359">hated that we once didn&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="171.22" dur="5.94">that we once were apathetic toward that</text>
  <text start="172.989" dur="5.97">we once broke all the time he gives us</text>
  <text start="177.16" dur="4.68">an inward desire and an unction through</text>
  <text start="178.959" dur="5.431">his spirit by his blood to now begin to</text>
  <text start="181.84" dur="6.27">learn and obey those precious</text>
  <text start="184.39" dur="5.28">Commandments and Shabbat is Shabbat is</text>
  <text start="188.11" dur="3.42">one of the most blessed Commandments I</text>
  <text start="189.67" dur="3.45">talked about this last night of course</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="4.92">every single commandment that you do</text>
  <text start="193.12" dur="5.28">brings blessing if you&amp;#39;re doing it out</text>
  <text start="196.45" dur="3.09">of a love for Jesus you&amp;#39;re doing it for</text>
  <text start="198.4" dur="4.11">the right reasons it always brings</text>
  <text start="199.54" dur="5.82">blessing even many wicked people who</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="5.97">pick and choose different laws can get</text>
  <text start="205.36" dur="5.939">blessings although God promises curses</text>
  <text start="208.48" dur="4.41">on those who don&amp;#39;t keep the whole law so</text>
  <text start="211.299" dur="2.94">it&amp;#39;s blessings mixed with curses this is</text>
  <text start="212.89" dur="3.14">why many in the Christian Church are</text>
  <text start="214.239" dur="5.461">smitten with diseases and sicknesses</text>
  <text start="216.03" dur="5.62">remember exodus says that I will not lay</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="5.039">any of these diseases upon you if you</text>
  <text start="221.65" dur="5.1">keep my Commandments see this is why I</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="6.06">used to vomit all the time when I was a</text>
  <text start="226.75" dur="10.19">kid teenager growing up I have not</text>
  <text start="230.799" dur="6.141">vomited since like the age of 18 or 19 I</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="7.98">had the flu once for like three days</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="8.16">back in 2015 I believe</text>
  <text start="245.01" dur="6.6">I think that&amp;#39;s it was a year that was</text>
  <text start="248.19" dur="8.4">the one time I was ever sick in the last</text>
  <text start="251.61" dur="7.379">I mean maybe an occasional cold or</text>
  <text start="256.59" dur="4.26">sniffle but because when you keep the</text>
  <text start="258.989" dur="3.451">Torah like for instance when you wear</text>
  <text start="260.85" dur="3.63">clothing a Vitamix fiber it actually</text>
  <text start="262.44" dur="4.65">strengthens your immunity system that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264.48" dur="4.439">actually not just I mean that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s proven by a guy who doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="268.919" dur="5.911">believe in the Bible when you follow</text>
  <text start="271.59" dur="5.91">that commandment see Jesus has no</text>
  <text start="274.83" dur="3.93">problems with you obeying all these</text>
  <text start="277.5" dur="2.79">Commandments and just wants to make sure</text>
  <text start="278.76" dur="3.84">that you don&amp;#39;t forget the big parts</text>
  <text start="280.29" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s what he said Matthew 20:25</text>
  <text start="282.6" dur="3.289">excuse me that&amp;#39;s what he said Matthew</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="5.67">23:23</text>
  <text start="285.889" dur="5.621">when he rebuked the Pharisees and</text>
  <text start="290.1" dur="2.85">Sadducees because they were they were</text>
  <text start="291.51" dur="2.82">doing the small things in Torah they</text>
  <text start="292.95" dur="3.21">were you know wearing tzitzit and they</text>
  <text start="294.33" dur="4.32">were tithing they were doing the little</text>
  <text start="296.16" dur="7.62">small things but they they weren&amp;#39;t doing</text>
  <text start="298.65" dur="6.48">judgment righteousness or faith they</text>
  <text start="303.78" dur="4.859">were leaving out the big parts of Torah</text>
  <text start="305.13" dur="6.18">they were living out love so he says in</text>
  <text start="308.639" dur="4.021">Matthew 23:23 says very clearly I would</text>
  <text start="311.31" dur="2.82">that you would do these things and not</text>
  <text start="312.66" dur="3.75">leave the others undone in other words</text>
  <text start="314.13" dur="7.23">it&amp;#39;s not that he was criticizing them</text>
  <text start="316.41" dur="6.45">for wearing the Zizi or for tithing but</text>
  <text start="321.36" dur="3.69">he was criticizing them for leaving the</text>
  <text start="322.86" dur="4.47">huge heart and soul out of Torah and</text>
  <text start="325.05" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s what Jesus taught us to do he</text>
  <text start="327.33" dur="3.6">taught us how to obey the Torah every</text>
  <text start="329.52" dur="4.2">jot and tittle of the Torah out of a</text>
  <text start="330.93" dur="5.609">heart of love and that&amp;#39;s what the New</text>
  <text start="333.72" dur="4.5">Covenant all about and furthermore Jesus</text>
  <text start="336.539" dur="3.211">said wherever this New Covenant wherever</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="4.16">this New Testament wherever this gospel</text>
  <text start="339.75" dur="5.66">is preached this story will be told</text>
  <text start="342.38" dur="7.18">about the woman with the alabaster jar</text>
  <text start="345.41" dur="7">the precious oil you&amp;#39;ll see that toward</text>
  <text start="349.56" dur="5.63">the top of my website but it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="355.19" dur="3.97">alabaster jar of oil worth what would be</text>
  <text start="357.6" dur="3.3">you know worth thousands of dollars in</text>
  <text start="359.16" dur="3.569">our modern-day currency and she she</text>
  <text start="360.9" dur="4.05">poured that oil on Yahshua&amp;#39;s feet and</text>
  <text start="362.729" dur="3.781">used your hair to wipe the oil into her</text>
  <text start="364.95" dur="3.66">feet mingled with her tears</text>
  <text start="366.51" dur="5.129">showing her absolute love and adoration</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="4.95">for the Messiah because when you fully</text>
