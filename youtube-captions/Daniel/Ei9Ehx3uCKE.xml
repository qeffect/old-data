  <text start="4.02" dur="5.94">eleventh Hebrew month and tonight we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="7.14" dur="6.24">gonna go over he brews Chapter eight so</text>
  <text start="9.96" dur="5.94">Hebrew seven was all about the Mikkel</text>
  <text start="13.38" dur="4.26">Zadok priesthood being superior to the</text>
  <text start="15.9" dur="3.48">Levitical priesthood not that the Mikkel</text>
  <text start="17.64" dur="3.96">Zadok priesthood cancel out or nullify</text>
  <text start="19.38" dur="3.96">the Levitical priesthood but it is</text>
  <text start="21.6" dur="5.339">superior and that is the priesthood that</text>
  <text start="23.34" dur="5.189">Yahshua comes from and so continuing on</text>
  <text start="26.939" dur="3.811">in Hebrews chapter eight now of the</text>
  <text start="28.529" dur="3.78">things which we have spoken this is the</text>
  <text start="30.75" dur="2.88">sons now we&amp;#39;re gonna get a nice summary</text>
  <text start="32.309" dur="3.691">of everything that we&amp;#39;ve gone over for</text>
  <text start="33.63" dur="4.56">the first seven chapters of Hebrews we</text>
  <text start="36" dur="4.25">have such an high priest to a set on the</text>
  <text start="38.19" dur="6.27">right hand of the throne of the Majesty</text>
  <text start="40.25" dur="7.42">in the heavens a minister of the</text>
  <text start="44.46" dur="6.09">sanctuary and of the true tabernacle or</text>
  <text start="47.67" dur="7.229">the true Sukkot which Yahweh pitched and</text>
  <text start="50.55" dur="6.12">not man hallelujah for every high priest</text>
  <text start="54.899" dur="4.021">is retained to offer gifts and</text>
  <text start="56.67" dur="4.29">sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity</text>
  <text start="58.92" dur="4.56">that this man have somewhat also to</text>
  <text start="60.96" dur="4.26">offer for if he were on earth he should</text>
  <text start="63.48" dur="3.66">not be a priest seeing that there are</text>
  <text start="65.22" dur="5.67">priests that offer gifts according to</text>
  <text start="67.14" dur="6.06">the Torah who serve under the example</text>
  <text start="70.89" dur="4.86">and shadow of heavenly things as Moshe</text>
  <text start="73.2" dur="5.97">was admonished of yah when he was about</text>
  <text start="75.75" dur="5.7">to make the tabernacle for C says he</text>
  <text start="79.17" dur="4.589">that you make all things according to</text>
  <text start="81.45" dur="6.27">the pattern showed to you in the mount</text>
  <text start="83.759" dur="6.451">but now hath he hath Yahshua obtained a</text>
  <text start="87.72" dur="4.77">more excellent ministry by how much also</text>
  <text start="90.21" dur="4.38">he is the mediator of a better covenant</text>
  <text start="92.49" dur="4.919">which was established upon better</text>
  <text start="94.59" dur="5.73">promises so again it&amp;#39;s continuing the</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="4.801">theme from Hebrews 7 that you know</text>
  <text start="100.32" dur="3.689">Yahshua comes from a superior priesthood</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="5.79">he&amp;#39;s in the heavenly tabernacle that was</text>
  <text start="104.009" dur="5.64">pitched by Yahweh himself not like the</text>
  <text start="108" dur="5.22">priests who are making gifts every</text>
  <text start="109.649" dur="6.091">single year down on earth he only had to</text>
  <text start="113.22" dur="6.899">offer offer himself once for the</text>
  <text start="115.74" dur="6.089">sacrifice of sins and he&amp;#39;s and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="120.119" dur="5.901">why it&amp;#39;s a better it&amp;#39;s a better covenant</text>
  <text start="121.829" dur="7.081">because this covenant actually provides</text>
  <text start="126.02" dur="7.46">the atonement that we need for our</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="7.309">Passons and also provides the</text>
  <text start="133.48" dur="4.509">the separation from our past guilt so</text>
  <text start="136.219" dur="4.35">that we have the free conscience and the</text>
  <text start="137.989" dur="5.161">and the spirit to serve yeah</text>
  <text start="140.569" dur="4.411">to serve Him so this is a it&amp;#39;s a better</text>
  <text start="143.15" dur="4.47">covenant because it&amp;#39;s a covenant in</text>
  <text start="144.98" dur="4.379">which both parties are continuing in the</text>
  <text start="147.62" dur="4.92">covenant yah and those who have been</text>
  <text start="149.359" dur="4.47">called into this covenant and it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="152.54" dur="3.96">a better covenant because it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="153.829" dur="5.55">fullness it&amp;#39;s the full completion of</text>
  <text start="156.5" dur="5.4">what the of what many of the sacrifices</text>
  <text start="159.379" dur="4.291">pointed toward in the Torah which is to</text>
  <text start="161.9" dur="3.3">be filled totally with the spirit of</text>
  <text start="163.67" dur="4.769">course there were people who were felt</text>
  <text start="165.2" dur="6.509">the spirit in in the Tanakh throughout</text>
  <text start="168.439" dur="5.101">the throughout ancient Israel but it</text>
  <text start="171.709" dur="4.741">didn&amp;#39;t happen in the fullness like it</text>
  <text start="173.54" dur="4.379">happened when Yahshua died and rose</text>
  <text start="176.45" dur="3.06">again and poured out his Ruach on the</text>
  <text start="177.919" dur="3.811">day of a shower would it didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="179.51" dur="3.42">in mass like it like it does through</text>
  <text start="181.73" dur="5.149">this covenant so it&amp;#39;s definitely a</text>
  <text start="182.93" dur="7.05">better covenant with better promises</text>
  <text start="186.879" dur="5.411">verse 7 for if that first covenant had</text>
  <text start="189.98" dur="4.86">been faultless then should no place have</text>
  <text start="192.29" dur="3.99">been sought for the second so there is</text>
  <text start="194.84" dur="3">there was some faults in this first</text>
  <text start="196.28" dur="5.19">covenant we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re going to find</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="7.59">out what that fault was 8 for finding</text>
  <text start="201.47" dur="6.18">fault with them notice Yad is not find</text>
  <text start="205.43" dur="4.649">fault with the Torah he does not find</text>
  <text start="207.65" dur="4.229">fault with himself the thing the only</text>
  <text start="210.079" dur="6.06">thing that was faulty with this first</text>
  <text start="211.879" dur="6.51">covenant was with them for finding fault</text>
  <text start="216.139" dur="4.53">with them the ancient Israelites he says</text>
  <text start="218.389" dur="5.791">behold the day&amp;#39;s come says Yahweh when I</text>
  <text start="220.669" dur="5.1">will make a new renewed covenant with</text>
  <text start="224.18" dur="4.229">the house of Israel and with the house</text>
  <text start="225.769" dur="4.231">of Judah not according to the Covenant</text>
  <text start="228.409" dur="3.631">that I made with their fathers in the</text>
  <text start="230" dur="4.62">day when I took them by the hand to lead</text>
  <text start="232.04" dur="4.589">them out of the land of Egypt because so</text>
  <text start="234.62" dur="3.899">now he&amp;#39;s gonna repeat again what fault</text>
  <text start="236.629" dur="5.58">he found in the first covenant because</text>
  <text start="238.519" dur="6.541">they continued not in my covenant and i</text>
  <text start="242.209" dur="5.46">regarded them not says Yahweh so they</text>
  <text start="245.06" dur="4.139">had stiff and and uncircumcised hearts</text>
  <text start="247.669" dur="3.06">they didn&amp;#39;t want to continue in the</text>
  <text start="249.199" dur="3.481">promises that were offered to them and</text>
  <text start="250.729" dur="4.44">so then because of their continued</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="3.75">rebellion Yahweh then broke his covenant</text>
  <text start="255.169" dur="3.12">and said I&amp;#39;m not going to continue with</text>
  <text start="256.43" dur="3.419">these people I&amp;#39;m going to divorce them</text>
  <text start="258.289" dur="4.411">which we read about in the prophets that</text>
  <text start="259.849" dur="4.841">he issues a divorce and so this covenant</text>
  <text start="262.7" dur="5.29">is is is it&amp;#39;s broken</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s filled with faults but now</text>
  <text start="267.99" dur="2.97">he&amp;#39;s going to make a new covenant and</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="3.57">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to read about in</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="3.63">verse 10 it says for this is the</text>
  <text start="273.18" dur="4.02">Covenant that I will make with the house</text>
  <text start="274.59" dur="5.58">of Israel after those days says Yahweh I</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="5.76">will put my Torah into their mind and</text>
  <text start="280.17" dur="6.09">write them in the hearts and I will be</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="6.33">to them Allah and they shall be to me a</text>
  <text start="286.26" dur="5.52">people so this is a much superior</text>
  <text start="289.29" dur="4.86">covenant because now the Torah is God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="4.26">going to make sure that this Torah gets</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="3.66">into the hearts and minds of his people</text>
  <text start="296.04" dur="4.35">he wanted the tour to be in the hearts</text>
  <text start="297.81" dur="5.55">of the in minds of of the the children</text>
  <text start="300.39" dur="5.04">of Israel gathered at Sinai but they</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="3.39">were very stiff neck rebellious despite</text>
  <text start="305.43" dur="2.94">all the wonderful miracles that he</text>
  <text start="306.75" dur="3.51">performed they still didn&amp;#39;t have faith</text>
  <text start="308.37" dur="3.6">in Him and so they rebelled against it</text>
  <text start="310.26" dur="3.24">so y&amp;#39;all now had to create a new</text>
  <text start="311.97" dur="4.05">covenant and that&amp;#39;s what he did three</text>
  <text start="313.5" dur="5.34">oshawa he created a covenant that would</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="4.41">ensure that the Torah would be written</text>
  <text start="318.84" dur="3.06">on our hearts and minds and his spirit</text>
  <text start="320.43" dur="4.14">would fill us and how did he do that by</text>
  <text start="321.9" dur="5.25">offering himself as a sacrifice one</text>
  <text start="324.57" dur="5.04">sacrifice for all and now he&amp;#39;s our</text>
  <text start="327.15" dur="5.46">priest up not in the tabernacle made by</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="5.52">man but a tabernacle up in heaven and</text>
  <text start="332.61" dur="5.28">now he as a people he has Israel and</text>
  <text start="335.13" dur="4.32">Judah who are walking in his Torah out</text>
  <text start="337.89" dur="3.63">of a love for him out of an inward</text>
  <text start="339.45" dur="3.33">desire to keep his commandments because</text>
  <text start="341.52" dur="3.6">they love him so much</text>
  <text start="342.78" dur="4.11">this is what he had envisioned in the</text>
  <text start="345.12" dur="4.41">first covenant but it didn&amp;#39;t come to be</text>
  <text start="346.89" dur="4.05">why because he found fault with them</text>
  <text start="349.53" dur="4.91">because they didn&amp;#39;t continue in that</text>
  <text start="350.94" dur="8.22">covenant so now he had to make a new one</text>
  <text start="354.44" dur="6.04">verse 11 and they shall not teach every</text>
  <text start="359.16" dur="4.11">man his neighbour and every man his</text>
  <text start="360.48" dur="5.189">brother saying no Yahweh for all shall</text>
  <text start="363.27" dur="6.3">know me from the least to the greatest</text>
  <text start="365.669" dur="5.731">so the fulfillment that of the total</text>
  <text start="369.57" dur="3.93">fulfillment of the renewed covenant that</text>
  <text start="371.4" dur="4.11">was established 2,000 years ago will</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="4.5">find its complete and total fulfillment</text>
  <text start="375.51" dur="5.07">in the Millennial Kingdom because this</text>
  <text start="378" dur="4.62">is this is what verse 11 is referring to</text>
  <text start="380.58" dur="4.35">no one&amp;#39;s gonna have to teach anyone</text>
  <text start="382.62" dur="3.81">about the scriptures because his</text>
  <text start="384.93" dur="4.89">knowledge is going to flood the entire</text>
  <text start="386.43" dur="5.88">earth so the renewed covenant has not</text>
  <text start="389.82" dur="4.38">reached its fullness yet it&amp;#39;s still it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.31" dur="4.14">still point it&amp;#39;s still going to reach an</text>
  <text start="394.2" dur="3.7">even greater fulfillment just like when</text>
  <text start="396.45" dur="3.88">Yahshua got in the cross</text>
  <text start="397.9" dur="4.71">it caused that first covenant to reach a</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="3.869">greater fullness then when we get to the</text>
  <text start="402.61" dur="2.76">old kingdom this renewed covenant the</text>
  <text start="404.199" dur="3.78">one right now is going to reach a</text>
  <text start="405.37" dur="4.29">greater fullness and I dare say that</text>
  <text start="407.979" dur="4.681">beyond the 1,000 years we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="409.66" dur="8.819">see an even greater a greater fulness of</text>
  <text start="412.66" dur="7.08">this covenant hallelujah verse 12 for I</text>
  <text start="418.479" dur="4.081">will be merciful to their</text>
  <text start="419.74" dur="5.57">unrighteousness and their sins and their</text>
  <text start="422.56" dur="4.32">iniquities will I remember no more</text>
  <text start="425.31" dur="4.69">hallelujah</text>
  <text start="426.88" dur="5.909">why is he able to do that why is he able</text>
  <text start="430" dur="5.25">to not remember their iniquities anymore</text>
  <text start="432.789" dur="5.731">I mean he&amp;#39;s the same as he was back in</text>
  <text start="435.25" dur="4.86">ancient Israel why is he able to no</text>
  <text start="438.52" dur="5.63">longer remember their iniquities because</text>
  <text start="440.11" dur="6.15">he now has a people who are willing to</text>
  <text start="444.15" dur="4.78">completely and totally surrender to him</text>
  <text start="446.26" dur="4.5">and to follow him whereas before he had</text>
  <text start="448.93" dur="4.019">a people who by and large were</text>
  <text start="450.76" dur="4.68">rebellious and constantly going after</text>
  <text start="452.949" dur="4.831">idols and constantly not walking in the</text>
  <text start="455.44" dur="4.56">spirit like he wanted them to and so he</text>
  <text start="457.78" dur="3.78">the the the the iniquities of his people</text>
  <text start="460" dur="4.44">continued to come up in to in front of</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="4.44">his face but now this covenant ensures</text>
  <text start="464.44" dur="3.42">that he&amp;#39;s going to get a remnant he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466" dur="3.81">going to get a group of people from</text>
  <text start="467.86" dur="4.41">Judah and Israel who are gonna totally</text>
  <text start="469.81" dur="3.87">and completely love him hallelujah and</text>
  <text start="472.27" dur="4.889">that is what he&amp;#39;s been forming for the</text>
  <text start="473.68" dur="5.91">last 2,000 years verse 13 in that he</text>
  <text start="477.159" dur="4.98">says a new covenant or a renewed</text>
  <text start="479.59" dur="4.949">covenant he have made the first old now</text>
  <text start="482.139" dur="7.611">that which decays and wax old is ready</text>
  <text start="484.539" dur="8.551">to vanish away is ready to vanish away</text>
  <text start="489.75" dur="5.5">so that first covenant that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="493.09" dur="3.66">renewing in the first century was in the</text>
  <text start="495.25" dur="2.909">process of vanishing away because</text>
  <text start="496.75" dur="4.02">remember they were still coming up to</text>
  <text start="498.159" dur="5.521">Jerusalem for the feasts because the</text>
  <text start="500.77" dur="5.55">temple was there it would be there until</text>
  <text start="503.68" dur="4.2">70 CE II that was still something that</text>
  <text start="506.32" dur="2.909">needed to be done of course we still</text>
  <text start="507.88" dur="3.36">keep the peace but we&amp;#39;re not able to go</text>
  <text start="509.229" dur="3.151">up to Jerusalem because or we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="511.24" dur="3.39">to because there&amp;#39;s no temple there</text>
  <text start="512.38" dur="3.899">there&amp;#39;s no sanctify temple so part of it</text>
  <text start="514.63" dur="3.659">was vanishing away as if there was a</text>
  <text start="516.279" dur="5.07">transition time going between the first</text>
  <text start="518.289" dur="6.3">and second covenant continuing on in</text>
  <text start="521.349" dur="6.421">Hebrews chapter 9 then verily the first</text>
  <text start="524.589" dur="5.881">covenant had also also ordained or had</text>
  <text start="527.77" dur="3.18">also ordinances of divine service and a</text>

  <text start="571.66" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s amazing that at the very heart the</text>

  <text start="1040.41" dur="6.01">well what&amp;#39;s very important to understand</text>
  <text start="1042.82" dur="6.42">from Hebrews chapter 9 is that there is</text>
  <text start="1046.42" dur="5.58">no way there is no way we could</text>
  <text start="1049.24" dur="4.79">understand what Yahshua needed to do or</text>
  <text start="1052" dur="5.81">what he had to go through</text>
  <text start="1054.03" dur="7.89">unless Yahud first set up through angels</text>
  <text start="1057.81" dur="6.39">this Levitical system we had to we had</text>
  <text start="1061.92" dur="5.04">to understand the the purging of the</text>

  <text start="1066.96" dur="3.48">shadows we had to see all this we had to</text>
  <text start="1068.85" dur="2.79">live it we had to read about it we</text>
  <text start="1070.44" dur="4.05">understand it before we could ever</text>
  <text start="1071.64" dur="4.65">understand why Yahshua then had to come</text>
  <text start="1074.49" dur="3.75">and do it himself</text>
  <text start="1076.29" dur="3.66">and and offer that eternal sacrifice</text>
  <text start="1078.24" dur="4.86">that would be made in the heavenly</text>
  <text start="1079.95" dur="4.95">tabernacle so the shadow was absolutely</text>
  <text start="1083.1" dur="4.83">necessary before we could understand and</text>
  <text start="1084.9" dur="4.62">fully grasps the reality we as men had</text>
  <text start="1087.93" dur="4.11">completely and totally fallen away from</text>

  <text start="1092.04" dur="5.76">Adam we had been separated from him as</text>

  <text start="1100.95" dur="4.26">bringing us back to understand the even</text>
  <text start="1103.2" dur="4.2">understanding what needed to be done so</text>
  <text start="1105.21" dur="4.41">that we could be redeemed and so we had</text>

  <text start="1116.55" dur="5.37">understand the true the heavenly</text>
