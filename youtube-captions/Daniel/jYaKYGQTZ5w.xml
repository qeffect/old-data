  <text start="12.99" dur="2.97">day of Aviv getting closer and closer</text>
  <text start="14.4" dur="3.81">toward the end of this first month of</text>
  <text start="15.96" dur="4.11">the year and into the second month I</text>
  <text start="18.21" dur="5.1">just wanted to make a quick video about</text>
  <text start="20.07" dur="4.68">Psalm 109 which was my Scripture of the</text>
  <text start="23.31" dur="4.62">day this morning as I was spending time</text>
  <text start="24.75" dur="5.429">with yacht and you know so often we hear</text>
  <text start="27.93" dur="4.41">that oh you need to love your enemies</text>
  <text start="30.179" dur="4.47">bless those who curse you and that is</text>
  <text start="32.34" dur="4.559">all true that&amp;#39;s all what Yahshua spoke</text>
  <text start="34.649" dur="4.381">in the Gospels and yet we have this</text>
  <text start="36.899" dur="4.98">Psalm if you&amp;#39;ve ever read it it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="39.03" dur="5.34">Psalm 109 and listen to what David says</text>
  <text start="41.879" dur="4.321">he says hold not thy peace o yah my</text>
  <text start="44.37" dur="3.419">praise for the mouth of the wicked and</text>
  <text start="46.2" dur="3.87">the mouth of the deceitful are opened</text>
  <text start="47.789" dur="4.86">against me they have spoken against me</text>
  <text start="50.07" dur="4.86">with a lying tongue they compass me also</text>
  <text start="52.649" dur="3.871">about with words of hatred so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="54.93" dur="3.42">talking about all these wicked people</text>
  <text start="56.52" dur="4.26">who have basically returned his love for</text>
  <text start="58.35" dur="5.459">hatred and have been adversaries and and</text>
  <text start="60.78" dur="7.14">trying to hurt him and listen to what</text>
  <text start="63.809" dur="6.511">David says starting in verse 6 he</text>
  <text start="67.92" dur="4.47">basically asked yah set thou a wicked</text>
  <text start="70.32" dur="3.75">man over my enemies or over him let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="72.39" dur="3.42">Satan stand in his right hand when he</text>
  <text start="74.07" dur="3.6">shall be judged let him be condemned</text>
  <text start="75.81" dur="5.129">whoa David sounds like you&amp;#39;re cursing</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="5.79">here let his prayer become sin Wow</text>
  <text start="80.939" dur="4.231">David also praised this on his enemies</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="3.63">let his days be phew and let another</text>
  <text start="85.17" dur="4.379">take his office let his children be</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="4.349">fatherless and his wife a widow let his</text>
  <text start="89.549" dur="3.721">children be continually vagabonds and</text>
  <text start="91.439" dur="2.761">beg let them seek the bread also out of</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="3.27">their decimal places</text>
  <text start="94.2" dur="4.8">let the extortioner catch all that he</text>
  <text start="96.54" dur="4.92">has and let the stranger spoil his labor</text>
  <text start="99" dur="4.29">let there be none to extend mercy unto</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="3.75">him neither let there be any favor to</text>
  <text start="103.29" dur="5.07">his fatherless children let his</text>
  <text start="105.21" dur="4.949">posterity be cut off Wow and in the</text>
  <text start="108.36" dur="3.06">generation following let their name be</text>
  <text start="110.159" dur="3.331">blotted out</text>
  <text start="111.42" dur="4.08">let the iniquity of his fathers be</text>
  <text start="113.49" dur="4.019">remembered with Yahweh and let not the</text>
  <text start="115.5" dur="3.75">sin of his mother be blotted out let</text>
  <text start="117.509" dur="3.75">them be before Yahweh continually that</text>
  <text start="119.25" dur="7.619">he may cut off their memory from the</text>
  <text start="121.259" dur="7.5">earth skipping down to verse 17 as he</text>
  <text start="126.869" dur="3.06">loved cursing so David&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="3.84">his enemies who have been trying to</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="3.321">curse him as he loved cursing so let it</text>
  <text start="132.599" dur="2.301">come unto Him</text>
  <text start="133.25" dur="4.74">as he delighted not in his blessings so</text>
  <text start="134.9" dur="4.5">let it be far from him as he clothed</text>
  <text start="137.99" dur="3.09">himself with cursing like us with a</text>
  <text start="139.4" dur="3.75">garment so that it come into his own</text>
  <text start="141.08" dur="4.5">bowels like water and like oil into his</text>
  <text start="143.15" dur="3.69">bones let it be unto Him as the garment</text>
  <text start="145.58" dur="3.33">which covers him and for a girdle</text>
  <text start="146.84" dur="4.35">wherewith he girded himself continually</text>
  <text start="148.91" dur="4.74">let this be the reward of all mine</text>
  <text start="151.19" dur="4.11">adversaries of all mine enemies let this</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="3.57">be the reward from Yahweh and I&amp;#39;ve then</text>
  <text start="155.3" dur="4.65">that speak evil against my soul but do</text>
  <text start="157.22" dur="4.23">thou for me oh yah oh yah for your</text>
  <text start="159.95" dur="4.05">name&amp;#39;s sake because your mercy is good</text>
  <text start="161.45" dur="4.65">deliver thou me for I am poor needy and</text>
  <text start="164" dur="4.65">my heart is wounded within me I&amp;#39;m gone</text>
  <text start="166.1" dur="7.109">and so David a nasty ah to help him so</text>
  <text start="168.65" dur="6.15">now David&amp;#39;s not only praying a cursing</text>
  <text start="173.209" dur="3.241">upon his enemy but he&amp;#39;s praying that</text>
  <text start="174.8" dur="3.32">these specific enemies who have been</text>
  <text start="176.45" dur="3.84">cursing David and coming against him and</text>
  <text start="178.12" dur="4.15">returning David&amp;#39;s love with hatred</text>
  <text start="180.29" dur="5.07">David is specifically asking that these</text>
  <text start="182.27" dur="4.469">people are completely blotted out that</text>
  <text start="185.36" dur="3.15">their memories cut off from the earth</text>
  <text start="186.739" dur="3.72">that they are basically sent to the lake</text>
  <text start="188.51" dur="3.72">of fire is what David is praying</text>
  <text start="190.459" dur="3.271">I mean he&amp;#39;s not praying that they</text>
  <text start="192.23" dur="3.03">eventually come to repentance or mercy</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="3.93">he&amp;#39;s praying that they go to the lake of</text>
  <text start="195.26" dur="4.14">fire now wait a minute I thought we</text>
  <text start="197.66" dur="3.93">understood that yah doesn&amp;#39;t want anyone</text>
  <text start="199.4" dur="4.98">to perish we understood that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="201.59" dur="5.52">said love your enemies and bless those</text>
  <text start="204.38" dur="4.95">that curse you and yet we know the Bible</text>
  <text start="207.11" dur="5.04">does not contradict so how do we</text>
  <text start="209.33" dur="4.62">reconcile Psalm 109 with all these other</text>
  <text start="212.15" dur="3.39">statements about how yah doesn&amp;#39;t desire</text>
  <text start="213.95" dur="3">any of the wicked to perish and how</text>
  <text start="215.54" dur="4.919">Yahshua tells us to bless those who</text>
  <text start="216.95" dur="5.64">curse us well you see it we have to</text>
  <text start="220.459" dur="5.851">understand that the concept of love as</text>
  <text start="222.59" dur="5.73">Yahshua taught teaches us is rooted in</text>
  <text start="226.31" dur="4.35">Torah and that concept of love is very</text>
  <text start="228.32" dur="6.06">different from the modern American type</text>
  <text start="230.66" dur="5.4">of love we have today okay obviously we</text>
  <text start="234.38" dur="3.3">see in Psalm 109 and there are other</text>
  <text start="236.06" dur="4.38">Psalms as well that are known as</text>
  <text start="237.68" dur="4.98">imprecatory prayers that the ruach</text>
  <text start="240.44" dur="2.76">ha&amp;#39;qodesh and this comes with a gift of</text>
  <text start="242.66" dur="2.88">discernment</text>
  <text start="243.2" dur="5.819">but the ruach ha&amp;#39;qodesh will show you</text>
  <text start="245.54" dur="6.66">and guide you during specific times with</text>
  <text start="249.019" dur="5.491">specific people to pray this prayer that</text>
  <text start="252.2" dur="4.8">there are people that yah wants you to</text>
  <text start="254.51" dur="4.83">pray will be blotted out and will go to</text>
  <text start="257" dur="4.83">the lake of fire now I know that may</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="5.04">sound hot horrifying to you but you have</text>
  <text start="261.83" dur="4.14">to understand that yah does not strive</text>
  <text start="264.38" dur="2.7">with man forever there is this</text>
  <text start="265.97" dur="3.21">understanding of</text>
  <text start="267.08" dur="3.54">of reprobation say well Daniel there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.18" dur="3.049">no way we can know who&amp;#39;s reprobate and</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="3.57">who&amp;#39;s not well that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="272.229" dur="3.4">obviously David understood that these</text>
  <text start="274.19" dur="2.939">particular people were a reprobate</text>
  <text start="275.629" dur="3.061">because under the unction of the Ruach</text>
  <text start="277.129" dur="3.331">Hakodesh he prayed this and it was</text>
  <text start="278.69" dur="4.53">preserved by yot in his word for</text>
  <text start="280.46" dur="5.13">thousands of years so we can know when</text>
  <text start="283.22" dur="4.14">yah has turned specific people to</text>
  <text start="285.59" dur="3.66">reprobate and we can pray that there are</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="3.869">blotted out but they&amp;#39;re sent to the lake</text>
  <text start="289.25" dur="3.81">of fire so well Daniel he never says</text>
  <text start="291.229" dur="3.18">like a fire look David says they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.06" dur="3.78">blotted out he says that they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="294.409" dur="4.98">receive yaws mercy ever he prays against</text>
  <text start="296.84" dur="4.74">their families I mean he this is about</text>
  <text start="299.389" dur="4.02">as all-encompassing as you can get of a</text>
  <text start="301.58" dur="3.929">person getting cut off and sent to a</text>
  <text start="303.409" dur="3.451">lake of fire this is what it all is</text>
  <text start="305.509" dur="4.741">entailed so you can tell from the</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="4.709">wording now obviously you can&amp;#39;t go to</text>
  <text start="310.25" dur="2.52">the other extreme where you abuse this</text>
  <text start="311.569" dur="2.4">and you pray this all the time for</text>
  <text start="312.77" dur="2.519">everyone no no that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="313.969" dur="4.35">what it&amp;#39;s saying and not every psalm is</text>
  <text start="315.289" dur="6.451">like this but there are specific times</text>
  <text start="318.319" dur="5.761">where this is necessary and it does not</text>
  <text start="321.74" dur="4.38">contradict love nor does it contradict</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="3.57">what Yahshua says when he says pray for</text>
  <text start="326.12" dur="2.609">enemies bless those who persecute you</text>
  <text start="327.65" dur="3.72">and curse you who doesn&amp;#39;t contradict</text>
  <text start="328.729" dur="3.87">that okay even Yahshua on the cross that</text>
  <text start="331.37" dur="2.88">forgive them for they know not what they</text>
  <text start="332.599" dur="3.451">do when they crucified Him and there</text>
  <text start="334.25" dur="4.139">were those who crucified Him who</text>
  <text start="336.05" dur="4.859">repented they were not reprobate but in</text>
  <text start="338.389" dur="4.56">this situation these people were</text>
  <text start="340.909" dur="3.54">reprobate and David knew that from the</text>
  <text start="342.949" dur="4.111">gift of discernment and he prayed this</text>
  <text start="344.449" dur="4.291">prayer so it all comes down to the gift</text>
  <text start="347.06" dur="3.329">of the sermon to the gift of knowledge</text>
  <text start="348.74" dur="3.239">these are gifts of the ruach ha&amp;#39;qodesh</text>
  <text start="350.389" dur="5.551">that you should pray for in your life</text>
  <text start="351.979" dur="5.55">the gifts of these of the spirit of the</text>
  <text start="355.94" dur="4.319">rock will ripen in your life and will</text>
  <text start="357.529" dur="5.341">grow more and more effective in your</text>
  <text start="360.259" dur="4.741">life as you walk in his word his Torah</text>
  <text start="362.87" dur="4.349">keeping his Commandments obeying him out</text>
  <text start="365" dur="4.139">of a love for him and also the fruits of</text>
  <text start="367.219" dur="3.781">the rock love joy peace will also ripen</text>
  <text start="369.139" dur="3.691">as well but none of those fruits of love</text>
  <text start="371" dur="5.039">joy and peace and none of the gifts</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="4.739">Conner Dix what we see here and we have</text>
  <text start="376.039" dur="4.111">to understand that we have to understand</text>
  <text start="377.569" dur="4.71">that the way love is in the scripture is</text>
  <text start="380.15" dur="3.54">not what many in the church and</text>
  <text start="382.279" dur="3.151">Messianic movements think of love is</text>
  <text start="383.69" dur="4.77">today and it&amp;#39;s very important to</text>
