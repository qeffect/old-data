  <text start="67.11" dur="7.77">land grant giving to Abraham 3,000 4,000</text>
  <text start="71.28" dur="6.51">years ago so when Yahshua the Messiah of</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="5.099">Israel comes to rule and reign and on</text>
  <text start="77.79" dur="3.96">his throne in Jerusalem Israel will</text>
  <text start="79.979" dur="3.331">stretch across from the nile river in</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="3.689">egypt all the way to the affray tease</text>
  <text start="83.31" dur="5.25">and it says in the Book of Psalms Psalm</text>

  <text start="88.56" dur="3.75">will stretch from the rising of the Sun</text>
  <text start="90.63" dur="3.21">to the setting of the Sun which</text>
  <text start="92.31" dur="4.28">basically needs is going to control the</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="6.87">whole earth now during that time period</text>
  <text start="96.59" dur="6.01">it says that if any nation does not come</text>
  <text start="100.71" dur="4.47">up to Jerusalem for the feast of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="102.6" dur="5.19">for Tabernacles to honor the King</text>
  <text start="105.18" dur="6.36">Messiah Yahshua upon that nation that</text>
  <text start="107.79" dur="6.57">will receive no rain so at this time in</text>
  <text start="111.54" dur="4.859">the future once the Christians call him</text>
  <text start="114.36" dur="4.5">Jesus Christ the Jews golem Yahshua</text>
  <text start="116.399" dur="4.5">HaMashiach once he returns and he takes</text>
  <text start="118.86" dur="4.439">up his throne all nations will be</text>

  <text start="130.19" dur="3.24">he&amp;#39;s ruling and reigning that these</text>
  <text start="131.3" dur="3.96">living waters are going to gush out so I</text>
  <text start="133.43" dur="4.83">thought it was a beautiful picture where</text>
  <text start="135.26" dur="5.91">you can see these beautiful crystal blue</text>
  <text start="138.26" dur="5.73">waters gushing forth you see the power</text>
  <text start="141.17" dur="6.12">the power of these waters they carve the</text>
  <text start="143.99" dur="5.49">rock and they flow down the river this</text>
  <text start="147.29" dur="4.08">is nothing compared to the Living Waters</text>
  <text start="149.48" dur="4.14">that will gush forth from the throne of</text>
  <text start="151.37" dur="5.88">the Lamb also one thing I was sharing</text>
  <text start="153.62" dur="6.42">yesterday during shabbat is that if you</text>
  <text start="157.25" dur="5.64">think about how tall Mount Everest is</text>

  <text start="162.89" dur="4.08">Mount Zion is just a little hill but it</text>
  <text start="165.38" dur="3.359">says when Yahshua returns there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.97" dur="3.54">going to shake so much that mount sign</text>
  <text start="168.739" dur="4.021">will become the tallest and greatest</text>
  <text start="170.51" dur="4.35">mountain of all the mountains in the</text>
  <text start="172.76" dur="4.44">earth that means that at that time when</text>

  <text start="177.2" dur="4.5">be taller way taller even than Everest</text>
