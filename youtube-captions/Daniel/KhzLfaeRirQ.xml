  <text start="168.12" dur="4.89">later on chapel oh that&amp;#39;s when it</text>
  <text start="169.68" dur="5.97">happened so when we read a Leviticus</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="4.62">chapter 15 it says and you shall count</text>
  <text start="175.65" dur="4.05">on you from the morrow after the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="177.63" dur="3.21">that&amp;#39;s that day of first fruits that</text>
  <text start="179.7" dur="3.42">happens during the week of unleavened</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="3.899">bread from the day that you brought the</text>
  <text start="183.12" dur="4.56">sheaf of the wave offering seven</text>
  <text start="184.739" dur="4.681">sabbaths shall be complete even under</text>

  <text start="191.76" dur="4.44">offer a new meat offering unto yahweh</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="7.12">you shall bring out of your habitations</text>

  <text start="202.62" dur="3.51">baked with lemon they are their first</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="4.47">fruits unto yahweh I here&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s really interesting 11 so we just</text>
  <text start="208.53" dur="6.36">celebrated the feast of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="210.15" dur="8.04">right because oftentimes 11 represents</text>
  <text start="214.89" dur="5.52">sin Joshua even said into the yeast of</text>
  <text start="218.19" dur="4.74">the Pharisees 11 of the Pharisees but</text>
  <text start="220.41" dur="9.63">now we have these two breads with 11 in</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="10.64">them well in was it Luke 13 we have now</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="3.53">a different meaning for love</text>
  <text start="238.7" dur="5.58">Yahshua the Messiah says how shall I</text>
  <text start="241.819" dur="5.041">like in the kingdom of God it is like</text>
  <text start="244.28" dur="4.739">leaven which a woman took and hid in</text>
  <text start="246.86" dur="6.3">three measures of mill till the whole</text>
  <text start="249.019" dur="7.051">was leavened so we have this bad type of</text>
  <text start="253.16" dur="5.43">yeast sin and then we have the good type</text>
  <text start="256.07" dur="4.05">of yeast his spirit which works in us</text>
  <text start="258.59" dur="9.2">and will eventually establish the</text>
  <text start="260.12" dur="7.67">kingdom of God on earth okay</text>
  <text start="267.87" dur="5.22">Deuteronomy 16 is the next reference to</text>
  <text start="270.82" dur="2.27">shadow</text>
  <text start="278.06" dur="4.53">seven weeks Shelf outnumber unto thee</text>
  <text start="280.419" dur="3.881">begin to number the seven weeks from</text>
  <text start="282.59" dur="3.78">such time as thou begin us to put the</text>
  <text start="284.3" dur="3.93">sickle to the corn and now she&amp;#39;ll keep</text>
  <text start="286.37" dur="3.87">the feast of weeks so it&amp;#39;s called shadow</text>
  <text start="288.23" dur="4.05">pentecost and the feast of weeks because</text>
  <text start="290.24" dur="6.14">we&amp;#39;ve counted these fifty days or forty</text>
  <text start="292.28" dur="6.33">nine weeks 49 days seven weeks plus one</text>
  <text start="296.38" dur="3.94">and you shall keep the feasts of weeks</text>
  <text start="298.61" dur="3.71">into yahweh your elohim with the tribute</text>
  <text start="300.32" dur="4.319">of a free will offering of your hand</text>
  <text start="302.32" dur="4.21">what you shall give unto yahweh your</text>
  <text start="304.639" dur="4.291">elohim according as yahweh your elohim</text>
  <text start="306.53" dur="4.59">a--the bless thee and you shall rejoice</text>
  <text start="308.93" dur="3.57">before Yahweh your Elohim you and your</text>
  <text start="311.12" dur="3.48">son and your daughter and your man</text>
  <text start="312.5" dur="3.3">serving your maidservant and the Levite</text>
  <text start="314.6" dur="2.64">that is within your gates and the</text>
  <text start="315.8" dur="3.39">stranger and the fatherless and the</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="3.6">widow and all those that are among you</text>
  <text start="319.19" dur="4.68">in the place which Yahweh your Elohim</text>
  <text start="320.84" dur="4.889">have chosen to places named there you</text>
  <text start="323.87" dur="3.6">should remember the thought was a bond</text>
  <text start="325.729" dur="4.831">man in Egypt than you shall observe and</text>
  <text start="327.47" dur="6.89">do these statutes and I forgot to read</text>
  <text start="330.56" dur="3.8">one verse back of Leviticus 23</text>
  <text start="338.249" dur="3.6">do you need to do</text>
  <text start="343.36" dur="4.679">so after you waive those red says you</text>
  <text start="346.539" dur="3.66">should reclaim on the cell Samia that it</text>
  <text start="348.039" dur="3.9">may be a holy convocation you shall do</text>
  <text start="350.199" dur="3.99">no survive work therein so this is</text>
  <text start="351.939" dur="4.921">considered a Sabbath day a Shabbat and</text>
  <text start="354.189" dur="3.901">it should be a statute forever in all</text>
  <text start="356.86" dur="5.04">your dwellings throughout your</text>
  <text start="358.09" dur="6.06">generations so this is a commandment</text>
  <text start="361.9" dur="3.979">that is still applicable today to</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="4.169">statute that&amp;#39;s supposed to go forever</text>
  <text start="365.879" dur="7.09">throughout your generations let me</text>
  <text start="368.319" dur="7.91">qualify that so there&amp;#39;s a temple right</text>
  <text start="372.969" dur="5.7">and a lot of these feasts can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="376.229" dur="4.271">celebrated in the fullness until we have</text>
  <text start="378.669" dur="5.701">a temple but the temple was destroyed</text>
  <text start="380.5" dur="6.77">let&amp;#39;s destroy way back in 70 AD however</text>
  <text start="384.37" dur="5.849">if you go to Zechariah chapter 14 and</text>
  <text start="387.27" dur="4.929">you go to the last four chapters in</text>
  <text start="390.219" dur="4.95">Ezekiel we read about these sacrifices</text>
  <text start="392.199" dur="8.131">again like wait a minute what&amp;#39;s up with</text>
  <text start="395.169" dur="7.951">that so my understanding is this there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="4.32">going to come a time when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="403.12" dur="3.509">resurrected and we&amp;#39;re going to be with</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="4.62">the Messiah we&amp;#39;re going to be with him</text>
  <text start="406.629" dur="5.641">and it says he&amp;#39;s going to come back down</text>
  <text start="409.27" dur="6.63">to earth and he&amp;#39;s going to basically</text>
  <text start="412.27" dur="5.549">rule and reign hey Shalom guys he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="415.9" dur="4.97">going to basically rule and reign from</text>
  <text start="417.819" dur="5.491">Jerusalem for a thousand years and</text>
  <text start="420.87" dur="4.15">during that thousand years time we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="423.31" dur="5.069">here in our resurrected bodies but there</text>
  <text start="425.02" dur="5.19">are others here too right and so these</text>
  <text start="428.379" dur="4.32">animal sacrifices are going to be done</text>
  <text start="430.21" dur="5.34">again but remember the animal sacrifices</text>
  <text start="432.699" dur="5.011">they were never ever ever able to</text>
  <text start="435.55" dur="4.739">provide atonement never we know that</text>
  <text start="437.71" dur="3.81">from the book of Hebrews back in the Old</text>
  <text start="440.289" dur="4.53">Testament times they were pointing</text>
  <text start="441.52" dur="4.919">forward to the Messiah right well in the</text>
  <text start="444.819" dur="3.361">Millennial Kingdom when the temples</text>
  <text start="446.439" dur="2.94">re-establish that Yahshua is ruling and</text>
  <text start="448.18" dur="2.94">reigning and these the animal sacrifices</text>
  <text start="449.379" dur="3.421">are done again they&amp;#39;re still not going</text>
  <text start="451.12" dur="4.079">to provide atonement they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="452.8" dur="5.339">pointing back toward what Messiah did</text>
  <text start="455.199" dur="5.101">okay the only atonement that can cover</text>
  <text start="458.139" dur="4.59">us is the atonement of Messiah of</text>
  <text start="460.3" dur="4.979">Yahshua that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s always been</text>
  <text start="462.729" dur="3.851">the case always these sacrifices are</text>
  <text start="465.279" dur="3.64">simply done as a shadow</text>
  <text start="466.58" dur="4.109">whether its forward-looking like it was</text>
  <text start="468.919" dur="3.78">for ancient Israel or whether it will be</text>
  <text start="470.689" dur="5.1">backward looking when it is in the</text>
  <text start="472.699" dur="4.321">Millennial Kingdom so I just wanted it I</text>
  <text start="475.789" dur="3.93">wanted to cover that so what we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="477.02" dur="4.679">here today we&amp;#39;re doing all we can we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.719" dur="4.47">doing all we know to do for this feast</text>
  <text start="481.699" dur="6.09">we&amp;#39;re doing all we can in this present</text>
  <text start="484.189" dur="5.431">modern-day Babylonian society which it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="487.789" dur="4.141">dently that&amp;#39;s exactly what Daniel did</text>
  <text start="489.62" dur="3.569">Daniel didn&amp;#39;t have a temple didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="491.93" dur="2.759">all these things but he did what he</text>
  <text start="493.189" dur="3.091">could he called the dietary laws for</text>
  <text start="494.689" dur="4.23">instance and he did what he could the</text>
  <text start="496.28" dur="8.22">follow- and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing so I</text>
  <text start="498.919" dur="7.611">just want to make that clear okay so do</text>
  <text start="504.5" dur="2.03">you</text>
  <text start="510.169" dur="4.04">in Exodus chapter 19</text>
  <text start="515.769" dur="4.26">so the beginning of the year happened</text>
  <text start="517.599" dur="4.74">back in April and Passover happens on</text>
  <text start="520.029" dur="3.87">the fourteenth day of the first month so</text>
  <text start="522.339" dur="4.711">late sort of mid to late april has</text>
  <text start="523.899" dur="5.28">happened this year and now we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="527.05" dur="5.819">third hebrew month that month began a</text>
  <text start="529.179" dur="6.181">few days ago last week and so we breathe</text>
  <text start="532.869" dur="4.26">in Exodus 19 in the third month and the</text>
  <text start="535.36" dur="3.75">children of Israel were gone for out of</text>
  <text start="537.129" dur="4.83">the land of Egypt that same day they</text>
  <text start="539.11" dur="4.139">came the wilderness of Sinai so this is</text>
  <text start="541.959" dur="4.44">where now they come up to that Mount</text>
  <text start="543.249" dur="6.541">Sinai this is where the Torah is given</text>
  <text start="546.399" dur="5.09">to Moses and this is when they got that</text>
  <text start="549.79" dur="4.709">golden calf incident happened where</text>
  <text start="551.489" dur="5.44">3,000 people were killed well here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="554.499" dur="5.041">question have for all of you 3,000</text>
  <text start="556.929" dur="4.38">people were killed on that day how many</text>
  <text start="559.54" dur="5.899">people were converted when Peter</text>
  <text start="561.309" dur="7.62">preached of the day of Pentecost 3,000</text>
  <text start="565.439" dur="5.68">so you see that three thousand died on</text>
  <text start="568.929" dur="4.291">that shovel thousands and thousands of</text>
  <text start="571.119" dur="5.34">years ago and then three thousand were</text>
  <text start="573.22" dur="5.969">added on the day of Pentecost so what we</text>
  <text start="576.459" dur="5.461">see here is that the Torah was given on</text>
  <text start="579.189" dur="5.01">Mount Sinai on that first Shavuot long</text>
  <text start="581.92" dur="4.649">long time ago and then when the shadow</text>
  <text start="584.199" dur="6.271">Pentecost happened began in the first</text>
  <text start="586.569" dur="9.291">century the Spirit was given so we&amp;#39;re</text>
