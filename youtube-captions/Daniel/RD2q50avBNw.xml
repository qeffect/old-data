  <text start="175.889" dur="5.511">block child sex traffickers that should</text>
  <text start="178.379" dur="5.73">be a no-brainer right unless unless</text>
  <text start="181.4" dur="4.419">google has an alternative motive as to</text>
  <text start="184.109" dur="3.451">why they want these sex traffickers to</text>
  <text start="185.819" dur="5.941">flourish because it get brings them</text>
  <text start="187.56" dur="6.539">profits as well but Google and big tech</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="4.53">are diametrically opposed to the bill</text>
  <text start="194.099" dur="3.691">which they ironically claim interferes</text>
