  <text start="296.39" dur="4.44">coming weeks but it&amp;#39;s a beautiful</text>
  <text start="298.25" dur="6.59">picture by a guy named james nesbitt and</text>
  <text start="300.83" dur="7.23">the prophetic slogan for oregon is</text>
  <text start="304.84" dur="5.89">throwing Jezebel from the wall I thought</text>
  <text start="308.06" dur="5.16">that was incredible haha I mean because</text>
  <text start="310.73" dur="4.8">I&amp;#39;ve been talking about how iming since</text>

  <text start="315.53" dur="5.01">overcome the spirit of jezebel and and</text>
  <text start="318.17" dur="4.32">and of course I think we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="320.54" dur="3.54">manifest now through Trump&amp;#39;s candidacy</text>
  <text start="322.49" dur="5.43">and and many other things that are going</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="5.43">on in the nation but yeah throwing</text>
  <text start="327.92" dur="2.97">Jezebel from the wall of course if you</text>
  <text start="329.51" dur="3.99">know the scriptures that&amp;#39;s how Jezebel</text>
  <text start="330.89" dur="5.1">met her death she was thrown out the</text>
  <text start="333.5" dur="5.28">window and splattered across the the</text>
  <text start="335.99" dur="4.83">ground and the dogs looked up her blood</text>
  <text start="338.78" dur="4.53">and that that&amp;#39;s her fate so may the</text>
  <text start="340.82" dur="5.19">Jezebel spirit be broken across this</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="4.47">nation hallelujah and of course now now</text>
  <text start="346.01" dur="2.82">that Trump has overcome the Jezebel</text>
  <text start="347.78" dur="4.11">spirit within the Republican Party</text>
