  <text start="6.41" dur="5.019">tonight begins the final Sabbath before</text>
  <text start="9.3" dur="5.249">Passover week which begins next week and</text>
  <text start="11.429" dur="5.821">we are in the four days between Lamb Day</text>
  <text start="14.549" dur="4.171">and Passover and which we are to remove</text>
  <text start="17.25" dur="4.68">all the leaven from our dwelling place</text>
  <text start="18.72" dur="6.149">and from where we are I just got back</text>
  <text start="21.93" dur="5.28">from unleavened my car I went to the</text>
  <text start="24.869" dur="4.021">local car wash and use the industrial</text>
  <text start="27.21" dur="3.27">vacuums there to get all the bread</text>
  <text start="28.89" dur="4.47">crumbs that had accumulated over the</text>
  <text start="30.48" dur="5.25">year in my car and so now my vehicle is</text>
  <text start="33.36" dur="4.65">completely unleavened and now I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="35.73" dur="4.59">to obey Exodus 12 by unleavened my</text>
  <text start="38.01" dur="4.86">entire dwelling place my house my</text>
  <text start="40.32" dur="6.989">apartment here and getting in getting</text>
  <text start="42.87" dur="6.419">ready for Passover next week so I just</text>
  <text start="47.309" dur="3.601">want to let everyone know that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="49.289" dur="3.381">making this tutorial to kind of help</text>
  <text start="50.91" dur="3.629">people who really don&amp;#39;t know a lot about</text>
  <text start="52.67" dur="4">unleavened bread or how to get the</text>
  <text start="54.539" dur="3.481">leaven out of their house I think some</text>
  <text start="56.67" dur="4.47">people tend to make this more difficult</text>
  <text start="58.02" dur="5.879">than it needs to be remember Deuteronomy</text>
  <text start="61.14" dur="5.07">30 starting in verses 10 and onward it</text>
  <text start="63.899" dur="3.781">says this law is not way up in the</text>
  <text start="66.21" dur="2.909">heavens that you should say who will go</text>
  <text start="67.68" dur="3.119">up into the heavens force and bring this</text>
  <text start="69.119" dur="3.781">law down to us that we may do it and</text>
  <text start="70.799" dur="3.631">it&amp;#39;s not way across the ocean that you</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="2.759">should say who will go across the ocean</text>
  <text start="74.43" dur="3">and bring this law to so we can do it</text>
  <text start="75.659" dur="4.471">but it&amp;#39;s in your mind it&amp;#39;s in your heart</text>
  <text start="77.43" dur="4.92">that you may do it his Commandments are</text>
  <text start="80.13" dur="3.84">easy to do they&amp;#39;re not convoluted</text>
  <text start="82.35" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re not twisted and hard to figure</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="4.289">out he is letting us know in Deuteronomy</text>
  <text start="86.31" dur="4.29">30 and in other scriptures that his</text>
  <text start="88.259" dur="4.621">Commandments are we are able to do them</text>
  <text start="90.6" dur="4.199">and especially now with the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="92.88" dur="4.02">which gives us an inward desire to obey</text>
  <text start="94.799" dur="4.351">Him in his word it makes it even easier</text>
  <text start="96.9" dur="3.929">so this commandment of unleavened in</text>
  <text start="99.15" dur="4.289">your house it&amp;#39;s not difficult it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="100.829" dur="4.591">hard to figure out it can be quite a bit</text>
  <text start="103.439" dur="4.651">of work depending on how much leaven is</text>
  <text start="105.42" dur="4.65">built up in your house but but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="3.599">difficult to do in terms of how to get</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="3.03">the leaven out it&amp;#39;s actually very simple</text>
  <text start="111.689" dur="3.091">so I&amp;#39;m gonna provide this tutorial in</text>
  <text start="113.1" dur="3.78">hopes of helping now I&amp;#39;ve tried to</text>
  <text start="114.78" dur="3.39">record this a couple times and I keep my</text>
  <text start="116.88" dur="3.029">phone keeps Wiggin out on me so</text>
  <text start="118.17" dur="4.35">hopefully I&amp;#39;ll get it recorded this time</text>
  <text start="119.909" dur="3.99">I&amp;#39;ve already sort of gone through my</text>
  <text start="122.52" dur="4.7">food stuff because I did that in my</text>
  <text start="123.899" dur="5.121">previous two videos so but I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="127.22" dur="4.47">kind of go over briefly what I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="129.02" dur="3.99">so far so I&amp;#39;m in my bedroom apologize</text>
  <text start="131.69" dur="2.16">for lighting is not the best lighting in</text>
  <text start="133.01" dur="2.79">the bedroom but I&amp;#39;m in the bedroom</text>
  <text start="133.85" dur="3.6">because I actually didn&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="135.8" dur="3.93">space for the food in the kitchen so we</text>
  <text start="137.45" dur="6.21">actually have shelves in this bedroom</text>
  <text start="139.73" dur="6.06">where I&amp;#39;ve put overflow food and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.66" dur="5.13">the shelves of food and I just kind of</text>
  <text start="145.79" dur="5.37">went through those like for example with</text>
  <text start="148.79" dur="4.43">crackers and chips you always want to</text>
  <text start="151.16" dur="5.04">check those like I had these these</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="5.08">salted caramel rice crepe cake crackers</text>
  <text start="156.2" dur="3.93">but I checked they&amp;#39;re organic and they</text>
  <text start="158.3" dur="3.63">actually do not have any leavening agent</text>
  <text start="160.13" dur="2.94">in there when you&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="161.93" dur="3.33">ingredients you want to look for things</text>
  <text start="163.07" dur="4.11">that say leavening agent sometimes it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="165.26" dur="5.28">say that it&amp;#39;ll also say yeast or yeast</text>
  <text start="167.18" dur="5.4">extract it&amp;#39;ll match safe up potassium</text>
  <text start="170.54" dur="3.36">bicarbonate or baking soda or baking</text>
  <text start="172.58" dur="3.39">powder which are always used as</text>
  <text start="173.9" dur="3.63">leavening agents within foods so if you</text>
  <text start="175.97" dur="4.83">see anything like that you want to get</text>
  <text start="177.53" dur="6.42">rid of those foods so a lot of these</text>
  <text start="180.8" dur="6.57">foods on here are mustards and soups and</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="5.34">vegetables and popcorn and peanut butter</text>
  <text start="187.37" dur="3.27">and Rice&amp;#39;s and things a lot of the</text>
  <text start="189.29" dur="4.65">things are not going to have 11 and then</text>
  <text start="190.64" dur="6.33">leaven is generally in broths or soups</text>
  <text start="193.94" dur="5.519">or crackers and chips or in breads of</text>
  <text start="196.97" dur="4.68">course I&amp;#39;ve made a pile here that you</text>
  <text start="199.459" dur="5.041">can see of the leaven products I found</text>
  <text start="201.65" dur="5.58">out that the the saltine crackers they</text>
  <text start="204.5" dur="4.83">all have yeast in them so you got to get</text>
  <text start="207.23" dur="3.66">rid of that and I have some Hembrough</text>
  <text start="209.33" dur="2.76">Hamburger Helper here actually I should</text>
  <text start="210.89" dur="2.819">I&amp;#39;ve had this because this has a lot of</text>
  <text start="212.09" dur="3.709">bad ingredients in it but that has</text>
  <text start="213.709" dur="6.151">leavening this is some graham cracker</text>
  <text start="215.799" dur="7.361">crust for pies as leavening this was</text>
  <text start="219.86" dur="4.74">some bread some hamburger rolls and hot</text>
  <text start="223.16" dur="3.54">dog rolls that I had on top of the</text>
  <text start="224.6" dur="3.24">refrigerator and some bread that I had</text>
  <text start="226.7" dur="3.39">that I got to get rid of some challah</text>
  <text start="227.84" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s left over a lot of your</text>
  <text start="230.09" dur="4.5">buttermilk cake mixes those was gonna</text>
  <text start="231.95" dur="5.46">have eleven and then of course bread</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="5.64">crumbs these got to get rid of those</text>
  <text start="237.41" dur="6.9">saltines hamburger helpers hamburger</text>
  <text start="240.23" dur="5.4">helpers always tend to have leavening</text>
  <text start="244.31" dur="3.989">agents in them so you want to get rid of</text>
  <text start="245.63" dur="5.669">those so that&amp;#39;s kind of a pile I&amp;#39;ve made</text>
  <text start="248.299" dur="7.321">there and then if you move into the</text>
  <text start="251.299" dur="5.401">kitchen so in your refrigerator you know</text>
  <text start="255.62" dur="3.51">it just kind of depends</text>
  <text start="256.7" dur="3.96">what you have most things probably are</text>
  <text start="259.13" dur="3.51">not gonna have leavening in your freezer</text>
  <text start="260.66" dur="3.78">because I mean I this like eating meats</text>
  <text start="262.64" dur="4.83">and things in here and fish which</text>
  <text start="264.44" dur="5.75">obviously is not going to have leavening</text>
  <text start="267.47" dur="4.98">agents if you look at your ice creams</text>
  <text start="270.19" dur="4.69">they&amp;#39;re not gonna have any leaven in it</text>
  <text start="272.45" dur="3.65">most won&amp;#39;t shouldn&amp;#39;t anyway unless you</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="3.03">have like cookie dough or something</text>
  <text start="276.1" dur="4.03">cookie dough ice cream what you want to</text>
  <text start="277.91" dur="3.81">get rid of tortillas you want to check</text>
  <text start="280.13" dur="3.93">some tortillas do have eleven and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="281.72" dur="4.59">but like these these are corn organic</text>
  <text start="284.06" dur="5.64">kuan tortillas to make little sliders</text>
  <text start="286.31" dur="4.65">and those have no no lemon in them so</text>
  <text start="289.7" dur="4.32">you want to check your tortillas and</text>
  <text start="290.96" dur="4.83">make sure in your refrigerator you know</text>
  <text start="294.02" dur="3.77">again I don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;ve kind of gone through</text>
  <text start="295.79" dur="6.96">all this already I don&amp;#39;t really have any</text>
  <text start="297.79" dur="9.13">leavening agents in things I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="302.75" dur="6.54">there&amp;#39;s any 11 in the ranch no most</text>
  <text start="306.92" dur="4.08">condiments ketchups mustard things like</text>
  <text start="309.29" dur="4.92">that you&amp;#39;re not gonna have any leaven in</text>
  <text start="311" dur="5.07">them you know you want to check and just</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="3.78">make sure on things but but like I said</text>
  <text start="316.07" dur="3.87">most things are not gonna have any any</text>
  <text start="317.99" dur="3.77">leaven in them I did check this barbecue</text>
  <text start="319.94" dur="4.83">sauce there&amp;#39;s no eleven in there</text>
  <text start="321.76" dur="5.44">mayonnaise and things like that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="324.77" dur="3.27">think you&amp;#39;re gonna have any eleven and</text>
  <text start="327.2" dur="2.31">you know I&amp;#39;ve been doing this for a</text>
  <text start="328.04" dur="2.97">while I still have to kind of check but</text>
  <text start="329.51" dur="2.94">now there&amp;#39;s no eleven in there so yeah</text>
  <text start="331.01" dur="3">most condiments things like that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="332.45" dur="3.51">not kind of eleven bacon have some</text>
  <text start="334.01" dur="3.27">turkey bacon no lemon in there and then</text>
  <text start="335.96" dur="2.43">of course your fruits and vegetables</text>
  <text start="337.28" dur="4.83">you&amp;#39;re not gonna have any lemon in there</text>
  <text start="338.39" dur="5.07">I did have these wraps to make like</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="3.24">wontons and things and I actually</text>
  <text start="343.46" dur="4.11">checked that no eleven in those I was</text>
  <text start="345.35" dur="4.82">kind of surprised at figured those would</text>
  <text start="347.57" dur="5.07">have loved them but they don&amp;#39;t so anyway</text>
  <text start="350.17" dur="4.42">that was pretty easy of course your</text>
  <text start="352.64" dur="4.5">spices you&amp;#39;re not gonna really have any</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="5.19">leaven in here as I mentioned earlier if</text>
  <text start="357.14" dur="4.35">you see baking soda or baking powder in</text>
  <text start="359.78" dur="3.21">the ingredients those are used as</text>
  <text start="361.49" dur="2.73">leavening agents within food so you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="362.99" dur="3.93">want to get rid of those food products</text>
  <text start="364.22" dur="5.46">however if you have baking soda or</text>
  <text start="366.92" dur="3.9">baking powder in and of themselves you</text>
  <text start="369.68" dur="2.64">don&amp;#39;t have to get rid of those those are</text>
  <text start="370.82" dur="4.68">not living agents in and of themselves</text>
  <text start="372.32" dur="4.83">unless they&amp;#39;re used to bake and cook for</text>
  <text start="375.5" dur="4.98">instance I have some baking powder</text>
  <text start="377.15" dur="4.71">baking soda excuse me mixed with sea</text>
  <text start="380.48" dur="2.37">salt to brush my teeth I don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="381.86" dur="3">get rid of that because that&amp;#39;s not being</text>
  <text start="382.85" dur="3.589">used for 11:00 so it&amp;#39;s just things it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="384.86" dur="3.579">being used for leaven</text>
  <text start="386.439" dur="4.53">there&amp;#39;s some sugars and things like that</text>
  <text start="388.439" dur="5.171">with your soups and things you do have</text>
  <text start="390.969" dur="5.46">to be careful a lot of soups don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="393.61" dur="4.379">lemon in them however as I hunted</text>
  <text start="396.429" dur="4.26">through all of these things I actually</text>
  <text start="397.989" dur="4.77">came across a chicken broth which does</text>
  <text start="400.689" dur="4.05">have yeast extract in it and I plan to</text>
  <text start="402.759" dur="5.43">actually have this chicken broth with</text>
  <text start="404.739" dur="4.41">some matzo ball soup before Passover so</text>
  <text start="408.189" dur="2.85">if you&amp;#39;re gonna make matzo ball soup</text>
  <text start="409.149" dur="3.72">which is a popular dish for Passover</text>
  <text start="411.039" dur="3.571">make sure you get chicken broth that</text>
  <text start="412.869" dur="2.91">does not have yeast extract in them</text>
  <text start="414.61" dur="2.899">because a lot of chicken broth the</text>
  <text start="415.779" dur="5.16">Doom&amp;#39;s you got to be careful in that</text>
  <text start="417.509" dur="4.69">this I gotta clean out this shelf right</text>
  <text start="420.939" dur="3.48">here but this was filled with a bunch of</text>
  <text start="422.199" dur="3.9">cereals and so I actually checked</text>
  <text start="424.419" dur="3.12">through all these cereals just to make</text>
  <text start="426.099" dur="4.23">sure there was no leaven now the cereals</text>
  <text start="427.539" dur="4.59">I happen to have Cheerios honey bunches</text>
  <text start="430.329" dur="4.95">of oats things like that they do not</text>
  <text start="432.129" dur="5.07">have any leavening products in them your</text>
  <text start="435.279" dur="3.99">oatmeal&amp;#39;s things like that don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="437.199" dur="3.84">have any living products however I came</text>
  <text start="439.269" dur="3.18">across a bunch more saltine crackers</text>
  <text start="441.039" dur="3.48">he&amp;#39;s actually a different brand but they</text>
  <text start="442.449" dur="6.601">still had lemon in them and then also</text>
  <text start="444.519" dur="6.15">any of your bisque wicks and pancake</text>
  <text start="449.05" dur="3.539">mixes those are gonna have leavening in</text>
  <text start="450.669" dur="6.54">them so you want to go to that I have</text>
  <text start="452.589" dur="6.72">these stovetop stuffing and panko bread</text>
  <text start="457.209" dur="4.56">crumbs that has obviously leaven and</text>
  <text start="459.309" dur="4.89">then here&amp;#39;s some more stuffing mix that</text>
  <text start="461.769" dur="4.56">has 11 in them and then you also want to</text>
  <text start="464.199" dur="5.51">check mixes like I was surprised I found</text>
  <text start="466.329" dur="6.87">this fish taco mix or excuse me this</text>
  <text start="469.709" dur="5.53">turkey gravy mix and it&amp;#39;s organic but</text>
  <text start="473.199" dur="4.56">believe it or not it I was reading</text>
  <text start="475.239" dur="3.3">through the ingredients so I couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="477.759" dur="7.02">find it here</text>
  <text start="478.539" dur="9.24">oh I thought it had let me let me check</text>
  <text start="484.779" dur="5.331">you know one of these had one of these</text>
  <text start="487.779" dur="2.331">had</text>
  <text start="493.01" dur="6.04">huh well--that&amp;#39;s I thought one of these</text>
  <text start="496.41" dur="6.78">ads leavening in them but maybe not I</text>
  <text start="499.05" dur="9.39">see her again cornstarch ain&amp;#39;t sugar</text>
  <text start="503.19" dur="7.5">oh yeah organic yeast right there yeah</text>
  <text start="508.44" dur="4.909">so in this turkey gravy mix even though</text>
  <text start="510.69" dur="5.51">it&amp;#39;s organic it has yeast in it and then</text>
  <text start="513.349" dur="6.791">the same brand for this fish taco mix</text>
  <text start="516.2" dur="5.41">this this does not have any yeast in it</text>
  <text start="520.14" dur="4.43">so there there you&amp;#39;re supposed to show</text>
