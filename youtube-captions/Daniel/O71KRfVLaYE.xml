  <text start="248.979" dur="4.111">and modern Christians out there will say</text>
  <text start="250.569" dur="5.19">Oh Daniel that&amp;#39;s Old Testament that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.09" dur="5.73">been nailed to the cross it&amp;#39;s Old</text>

  <text start="258.82" dur="1.87">been nail</text>
  <text start="259.22" dur="4.2">across that&amp;#39;s a misunderstanding of</text>
  <text start="260.69" dur="4.74">Apostle Paul but let&amp;#39;s go to what Jesus</text>
  <text start="263.42" dur="8.75">said all right let&amp;#39;s go to what Yahshua</text>
  <text start="265.43" dur="6.74">said and this is in John chapter 14</text>
  <text start="272.59" dur="9.49">starting in verse 21 he that has my</text>
  <text start="278.33" dur="7.74">Commandments and keepeth them he it is</text>
  <text start="282.08" dur="6.27">that loves me and he that loves me shall</text>
  <text start="286.07" dur="4.89">be loved than my father and I will love</text>
  <text start="288.35" dur="5.76">him and will manifest myself to him</text>
  <text start="290.96" dur="5.49">now what Commandments was Jesus was</text>
  <text start="294.11" dur="4.38">Yasha referring to after all this New</text>
  <text start="296.45" dur="5.37">Testament when he spoke those words had</text>
  <text start="298.49" dur="4.47">not even been written yet I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="301.82" dur="3.03">what Commandments he was talking about</text>
  <text start="302.96" dur="4.29">the very commandments that Moshe</text>
  <text start="304.85" dur="4.68">referred to he&amp;#39;s talking about the Torah</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="5.31">the prophets the things that he said he</text>
  <text start="309.53" dur="5.97">came not to abolish and in fact there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.56" dur="5.04">a second witness to this and just a</text>
  <text start="315.5" dur="4.77">couple verses later starting in verse 23</text>
  <text start="317.6" dur="5.88">again is John 14 I read verse 21 let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="320.27" dur="6.93">let&amp;#39;s go to verse 23 jesus answered and</text>
  <text start="323.48" dur="7.77">said unto him if a man love me he will</text>

  <text start="334.46" dur="5.79">our abode with him he that loves me not</text>
  <text start="337.4" dur="5.16">keeps not my sayings and the word which</text>
  <text start="340.25" dur="5.1">you hear is not mine but the fathers</text>
  <text start="342.56" dur="5.01">which sent me so again Jesus makes it</text>
  <text start="345.35" dur="4.08">very clear you obey me you keep my</text>
  <text start="347.57" dur="4.32">Commandments you obey my words you do</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="4.38">the things I tell you to do then then</text>
  <text start="351.89" dur="4.91">then you&amp;#39;re a part of me you love me and</text>
  <text start="353.81" dur="7.71">my father will love you if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="356.8" dur="7.24">you&amp;#39;re just you have no part of me know</text>
  <text start="361.52" dur="5.67">where it is Jesus does Yahshua imply</text>
  <text start="364.04" dur="5.629">that it&amp;#39;s impossible to keep his</text>
  <text start="367.19" dur="5.88">Commandments or his laws or his words</text>
  <text start="369.669" dur="5.141">nowhere nowhere he doesn&amp;#39;t say that at</text>
  <text start="373.07" dur="6.06">all he doesn&amp;#39;t say well I&amp;#39;ll do the best</text>
  <text start="374.81" dur="6.81">you can doesn&amp;#39;t say try no he says this</text>

  <text start="389" dur="5.04">black-and-white</text>
  <text start="390.59" dur="5.88">now if you still don&amp;#39;t want to take</text>
  <text start="394.04" dur="6.12">Jesus&amp;#39;s own words which hopefully if</text>
  <text start="396.47" dur="5.22">you&amp;#39;re a Christian you do but in Hebrews</text>
  <text start="400.16" dur="5.49">chapter 8 let&amp;#39;s talk about the New</text>
  <text start="401.69" dur="8.31">Covenant Hebrews chapter 8 starting in</text>
  <text start="405.65" dur="6.33">verse 10 for this is the Covenant that I</text>

  <text start="425.12" dur="3.359">and words that Jesus spoke up here we</text>
  <text start="426.919" dur="3.211">talk about the very same thing you know</text>
  <text start="428.479" dur="2.961">modern Christianity tries to say that we</text>
  <text start="430.13" dur="4.8">have all these different sets of laws</text>
  <text start="431.44" dur="5.26">hogwash nonsense this Bible doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="456.229" dur="5.371">the renewed covenant right here right</text>
  <text start="458.69" dur="4.5">here he takes all those Commandments all</text>
  <text start="461.6" dur="4.11">those statutes all those laws and he</text>
  <text start="463.19" dur="5.46">gives us an inward desire to obey Him</text>

  <text start="468.65" dur="4.769">us from all our past transgressions of</text>
  <text start="470.45" dur="5.79">Torah and then his spirit enables us</text>
  <text start="473.419" dur="4.771">that gives us a desire to begin to start</text>

  <text start="534.14" dur="4.77">New Testament first John chapter 3</text>
  <text start="536.66" dur="5.46">starting in verse 6 whosoever abides in</text>
  <text start="538.91" dur="4.89">him sins not to remember what sin is sin</text>
  <text start="542.12" dur="3.3">is transgression of the Torah in fact it</text>
  <text start="543.8" dur="4.05">says that a few verses earlier first</text>
  <text start="545.42" dur="6.06">John 3 for whosoever commits sin</text>
  <text start="547.85" dur="5.84">transgresses also the Torah the law for</text>
  <text start="551.48" dur="4.56">sin is the transgression of the law and</text>

  <text start="558.44" dur="4.64">never broke the Torah not even once and</text>
  <text start="560.62" dur="7.27">what was his purpose to take away our</text>

  <text start="577.16" dur="5.85">don&amp;#39;t have to do that it&amp;#39;s a satanic</text>
  <text start="580" dur="4.33">counterfeit gospel completely</text>
  <text start="583.01" dur="3.26">contradicts the scriptures and</text>
  <text start="584.33" dur="4.11">completely contradicts the New Testament</text>
  <text start="586.27" dur="3.94">because he came to take away our</text>
  <text start="588.44" dur="4.14">transgression of Torah and it teach us</text>
  <text start="590.21" dur="6.12">how to obey the Torah properly out of a</text>
