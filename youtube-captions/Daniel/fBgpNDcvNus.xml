  <text start="0.03" dur="3.03">shabbat shalom and Happy New Year</text>
  <text start="2.159" dur="5.521">everybody</text>
  <text start="3.06" dur="7.86">it is April 6 Saturday 2019 it is the</text>
  <text start="7.68" dur="6.24">first day the very first day of the</text>
  <text start="10.92" dur="5.279">first Hebrew month the month of Eve as</text>
  <text start="13.92" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s talked about in scriptures and I</text>
  <text start="16.199" dur="4.951">thought since we are now entering into</text>
  <text start="18.06" dur="6.84">the season of Passover which will begin</text>
  <text start="21.15" dur="7.5">in two weeks I wanted to do a timeline</text>
  <text start="24.9" dur="7.679">of Passover week the week that Messiah</text>
  <text start="28.65" dur="5.909">was crucified 2,000 years ago just so</text>
  <text start="32.579" dur="3.901">that people can understand how the</text>
  <text start="34.559" dur="7.621">progression works and how we celebrate</text>
  <text start="36.48" dur="9">these feasts each and every year so now</text>
  <text start="42.18" dur="5.55">remember that because the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="45.48" dur="5.61">calendar is both a lunar and solar</text>
  <text start="47.73" dur="4.82">calendar the Passover happens at a</text>
  <text start="51.09" dur="4.83">different time every year it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="52.55" dur="6.939">some time either in early April all the</text>
  <text start="55.92" dur="6.299">way to late April and it can happen on</text>
  <text start="59.489" dur="6.42">any day of the week but on this</text>
  <text start="62.219" dur="6.031">particular year that Messiah was</text>
  <text start="65.909" dur="5.791">crucified 2,000 years ago</text>
  <text start="68.25" dur="7.049">it fell on certain days the only way</text>
  <text start="71.7" dur="5.459">that it could fall in order to make sure</text>
  <text start="75.299" dur="4.68">that there were exactly three days and</text>
  <text start="77.159" dur="6.111">three nights between his crucifixion and</text>
  <text start="79.979" dur="6.121">his resurrection I remember the whole</text>
  <text start="83.27" dur="5.38">pagan template of Good Friday and Easter</text>
  <text start="86.1" dur="4.92">Sunday you could ever get 3 days and 3</text>
  <text start="88.65" dur="5.88">nights between a Friday and a Sunday no</text>
  <text start="91.02" dur="5.82">matter how hard you try and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="94.53" dur="5.519">that whole Ishtar goddess pagan</text>
  <text start="96.84" dur="4.95">symbolism with the easter egg laying</text>
  <text start="100.049" dur="4.131">rabbit all that stuff is complete and</text>
  <text start="101.79" dur="5.85">total paganism has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="104.18" dur="11.46">the death burial and resurrection of the</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="8">Messiah so so Passover week</text>
  <text start="119.17" dur="8.379">so what we started with first of all is</text>
  <text start="122.09" dur="8.009">a v10 the 10th day of the the first</text>
  <text start="127.549" dur="7.651">teamer month and that is lamb day every</text>
  <text start="130.099" dur="8.821">year and that happens four days before</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="6.149">Passover lamb day is the day where they</text>
  <text start="138.92" dur="3.78">select their lambs they inspect them</text>
  <text start="141.349" dur="2.64">they make sure that there&amp;#39;s no fault</text>
  <text start="142.7" dur="3.509">with in these lands they have to be a</text>
  <text start="143.989" dur="4.5">year old without blemish or spot and</text>
  <text start="146.209" dur="4.711">they select them four days before the</text>
  <text start="148.489" dur="6.121">actual Passover where they roast these</text>
  <text start="150.92" dur="7.17">lambs and eat them for the Passover so</text>
  <text start="154.61" dur="5.879">on the year that Messiah was crucified</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="10.95">this Aviv ten lamb day actually happened</text>
  <text start="160.489" dur="12.121">on a Saturday on a Shabbat and this was</text>
  <text start="169.04" dur="5.13">the day that Messiah this would be Palm</text>
  <text start="172.61" dur="3.03">Shabbat I know Christians think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.17" dur="3.78">Palm Sunday wasn&amp;#39;t pomp site was Palm</text>
  <text start="175.64" dur="4.77">Shabbat it happened on a Saturday on</text>
  <text start="177.95" dur="6.32">Sabbath and this was the day that he he</text>
  <text start="180.41" dur="8.73">rode in on the donkey</text>
  <text start="184.27" dur="11.79">[Music]</text>
  <text start="189.14" dur="6.92">and Jerusalem recognized him as the king</text>
  <text start="196.4" dur="7.07">this was prophesied that he would that</text>
  <text start="198.17" dur="11.12">this would occur in the province so then</text>
  <text start="203.47" dur="11.73">you have Sunday which would have been</text>
  <text start="209.29" dur="11.64">Aviv eleven that here and got Monday</text>
  <text start="215.2" dur="11.25">which would have been of Eve twelve and</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="7.68">then Tuesday which would have been a</text>
  <text start="226.45" dur="5.92">vivre</text>
  <text start="228.61" dur="6.19">thirteen and then remember a day begins</text>
  <text start="232.37" dur="4.65">in the evening right so like every week</text>
  <text start="234.8" dur="4.83">Shabbat begins on Friday at sundown and</text>
  <text start="237.02" dur="6.08">goes till Saturday sundown so the</text>
  <text start="239.63" dur="7.74">fourteenth day of Aviv which would be</text>
  <text start="243.1" dur="8.86">Passover the day of the Passover began</text>
  <text start="247.37" dur="7.5">Tuesday night that night and and that</text>
  <text start="251.96" dur="5.459">night Tuesday night was when Yahshua</text>
  <text start="254.87" dur="4.95">gathered with his twelve disciples and</text>
  <text start="257.419" dur="8.071">they had what the Christians called the</text>
  <text start="259.82" dur="7.83">Last Supper and this kicked off the</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="4.98">fourteenth day of a beef the very</text>
  <text start="267.65" dur="5.25">beginning of the Passover now what I do</text>
  <text start="270.47" dur="3.99">and and what Jeff and I will be doing</text>
  <text start="272.9" dur="6.019">when he comes up here in a couple weeks</text>
  <text start="274.46" dur="7.44">is that the night going into Passover I</text>
  <text start="278.919" dur="5.231">believe it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s Thursday night so</text>
  <text start="281.9" dur="8.04">going in 14th of a beef what I do is I</text>
  <text start="284.15" dur="10.1">have four four actually the five pieces</text>
  <text start="289.94" dur="7.97">of unleavened bread and then five</text>
  <text start="294.25" dur="7.15">goblets of juice organic green juice and</text>
  <text start="297.91" dur="7.36">we go through all four Gospel accounts</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="6.8">of this final Passover Memorial meal</text>
  <text start="305.27" dur="6.96">that Messiah shares and says disciples</text>
  <text start="308.2" dur="6.91">go just read through it do the washing</text>
  <text start="312.23" dur="6.12">of the feet all that good stuff um and</text>
  <text start="315.11" dur="5.779">then the fifth one is for we read a</text>
  <text start="318.35" dur="5.089">passage in Revelation revelation 9</text>
  <text start="320.889" dur="6.03">because when you read all the accounts</text>
  <text start="323.439" dur="7.92">of this Passover memorial supper in the</text>
  <text start="326.919" dur="6.48">in the in the Gospels he says Messiah</text>
  <text start="331.359" dur="5.34">says over and over again I will not</text>
  <text start="333.399" dur="4.83">drink this cup again with you until I</text>
  <text start="336.699" dur="3.93">drink it with you and my kingdom and</text>
  <text start="338.229" dur="5.28">that occurs in Revelation 19 at the</text>
  <text start="340.629" dur="5.52">wedding supper of the Lamb where he</text>
  <text start="343.509" dur="4.41">actually finally drinks that that that</text>
  <text start="346.149" dur="5.01">Cup with us once again when we&amp;#39;re with</text>
  <text start="347.919" dur="6.12">him at the wedding supper of the Lamb so</text>
  <text start="351.159" dur="4.38">so so that last supper that moved</text>
  <text start="354.039" dur="3.51">Passover week where Messiah was</text>
  <text start="355.539" dur="3.95">crucified happened that Tuesday night</text>
  <text start="357.549" dur="4.98">and of course this is when Judas</text>
  <text start="359.489" dur="4.57">betrayed Messiah when they after they</text>
  <text start="362.529" dur="5.4">were done with the supper they went and</text>
  <text start="364.059" dur="6.57">to be on mount Olive&amp;#39;s into the garden</text>
  <text start="367.929" dur="6.6">peace M&amp;amp;E where where the Messiah was</text>
  <text start="370.629" dur="5.85">arrested and he was arrested and passed</text>
  <text start="374.529" dur="4.71">back and forth between Pontius Pilate</text>
  <text start="376.479" dur="4.17">and Herod all that throughout that</text>
  <text start="379.239" dur="3.81">Tuesday night into early Wednesday</text>
  <text start="380.649" dur="4.44">morning because what was happening is he</text>
  <text start="383.049" dur="3.93">was he was the perfect Lamb of yah right</text>
  <text start="385.089" dur="8.09">and he was meetings inspected as that</text>
  <text start="386.979" dur="9.84">perfect lamb and so then on Wednesday</text>
  <text start="393.179" dur="5.92">Wednesday afternoon he was well actually</text>
  <text start="396.819" dur="4.92">started in the morning 9:00 a.m. went</text>
  <text start="399.099" dur="5.22">all the way till 3:00 p.m. but on</text>
  <text start="401.739" dur="4.98">Wednesday he was crucified so this is</text>
  <text start="404.319" dur="7.79">when this is when the crucifixion</text>
  <text start="406.719" dur="10.08">occurred and this crucifixion happened</text>
  <text start="412.109" dur="8.35">right as all the people that all the</text>
  <text start="416.799" dur="7.35">Jews who had come up to Jerusalem they</text>
  <text start="420.459" dur="4.89">had brought their lambs and they would</text>
  <text start="424.149" dur="2.97">bring it up to the high priest and the</text>
  <text start="425.349" dur="5.52">high priestess of the temple sacrificing</text>
  <text start="427.119" dur="5.91">these lambs and then the the families</text>
  <text start="430.869" dur="5.07">would bring their sacrifice lambs home</text>
  <text start="433.029" dur="6.42">with them and have the Passover Seder</text>
  <text start="435.939" dur="4.941">that&amp;#39;s commanded in exodus 12 that night</text>
  <text start="439.449" dur="5.931">that evening as the</text>
  <text start="440.88" dur="8.39">the Passover day was ending so so</text>
  <text start="445.38" dur="7.32">Messiah was literally being crucified as</text>
  <text start="449.27" dur="5.86">these lambs were being slaughtered on</text>
  <text start="452.7" dur="4.68">the Temple Mount and he was crucified on</text>
  <text start="455.13" dur="4.41">the Mount of skulls which was a part of</text>
  <text start="457.38" dur="4.65">the Mount of Olives just directly east I</text>
  <text start="459.54" dur="4.26">mean he could literally see the temple</text>
  <text start="462.03" dur="4.35">from where he was when he was when he</text>
  <text start="463.8" dur="7.17">was hanging on the stake on the tree and</text>
  <text start="466.38" dur="6.18">and so when that curtain divided when</text>
  <text start="470.97" dur="3.24">that earthquake happened when that</text>
  <text start="472.56" dur="4.26">temple he could actually literally look</text>
  <text start="474.21" dur="5.1">out and see the temple being shaken to</text>
  <text start="476.82" dur="6.2">its foundations when he gave his last</text>
  <text start="479.31" dur="6.33">gasp and died and said it is finished so</text>
  <text start="483.02" dur="6.22">so it was just amazing how he was</text>
  <text start="485.64" dur="5.52">literally literally crucified right as</text>
  <text start="489.24" dur="4.17">the high priest would have been up on</text>
  <text start="491.16" dur="4.83">the Temple Mount killing all these lambs</text>
  <text start="493.41" dur="4.74">and the families taking these lambs back</text>
  <text start="495.99" dur="4.2">so that evening Wednesday evening of</text>
  <text start="498.15" dur="4.5">course that they would have the Passover</text>
  <text start="500.19" dur="7.86">as the 14th day of Abib ends and goes</text>
  <text start="502.65" dur="9.96">into B 15 which B 15 is the first day of</text>
  <text start="508.05" dur="10.47">unleavened bread and the first day of</text>
  <text start="512.61" dur="9.059">unleavened bread is a high Sabbath right</text>
  <text start="518.52" dur="8.4">and then you have seven days of</text>
  <text start="521.669" dur="8.071">unleavened bread for Passover week so so</text>
  <text start="526.92" dur="5.94">they had to get Messiah off this cross</text>
  <text start="529.74" dur="4.62">and buried before this high Sabbath</text>
  <text start="532.86" dur="3.09">begins so they said the Sabbath is</text>
  <text start="534.36" dur="2.61">coming we&amp;#39;ve got to get him off we got</text>
  <text start="535.95" dur="3.48">to get them off and get him buried</text>
  <text start="536.97" dur="3.81">because we can&amp;#39;t do that on a high</text>
  <text start="539.43" dur="2.66">Shabbat on the first day of unleavened</text>
  <text start="540.78" dur="6.06">bread</text>
  <text start="542.09" dur="7.33">so this is where Joseph of Arimathea was</text>
  <text start="546.84" dur="5.97">allowed to take him off the cross and</text>
  <text start="549.42" dur="4.56">bury him in a tomb before before that</text>
  <text start="552.81" dur="6.36">evening before the first day of</text>
  <text start="553.98" dur="8.04">unleavened bread began right and so now</text>
  <text start="559.17" dur="6.84">we see where these three days and three</text>
  <text start="562.02" dur="5.64">nights come in between his death and</text>
  <text start="566.01" dur="4.199">then his resurrection so he&amp;#39;s literally</text>
  <text start="567.66" dur="5.07">buried as unleavened bread began</text>
  <text start="570.209" dur="6.201">so you have the crucifixion that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="572.73" dur="7.109">painted through Passover and of course</text>
  <text start="576.41" dur="6.76">this evening the 14th going into the</text>
  <text start="579.839" dur="5.85">15th of AB Eve that evening what I do is</text>
  <text start="583.17" dur="4.74">the excess twelve Passover Seder it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="585.689" dur="4.59">not the it&amp;#39;s not the full thing I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="587.91" dur="4.469">get a one year old lamb and I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="590.279" dur="5.54">the means to do that but but I do have</text>
  <text start="592.379" dur="5.76">lamb with eat lamb bitter herbs</text>
  <text start="595.819" dur="5.231">unleavened bread I usually make some</text>
  <text start="598.139" dur="7.29">Karasev as well and we we have the the</text>
  <text start="601.05" dur="7.319">full Passover twelve exited yeah Seder</text>
  <text start="605.429" dur="8.22">pastor over twelve excuse me Exodus 12</text>
  <text start="608.369" dur="7.291">Passover Seder that night so so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="613.649" dur="4.19">what&amp;#39;s occurring on on Wednesday evening</text>
  <text start="615.66" dur="5.13">so they bury him before the Sun sets on</text>
  <text start="617.839" dur="5.141">on Wednesday night before that first day</text>
  <text start="620.79" dur="3.87">of unleavened bread so his first night</text>
  <text start="622.98" dur="3.149">remember he has to be in the the earth</text>
  <text start="624.66" dur="3.69">in the graves three days and three</text>
  <text start="626.129" dur="3.841">nights that&amp;#39;s what he prophesied more</text>
  <text start="628.35" dur="4.26">than once throughout the gospel the four</text>
  <text start="629.97" dur="4.26">Gospel accounts so that first night</text>
  <text start="632.61" dur="5.339">Wednesday night would have been night</text>
  <text start="634.23" dur="11.849">one right and he was in the grave during</text>
  <text start="637.949" dur="18.98">the day on Thursday on Thursday and then</text>
  <text start="646.079" dur="18.99">a beef sixteen women Friday and then a</text>
  <text start="656.929" dur="11.44">beef 17 would have been Shabbat and then</text>
  <text start="665.069" dur="4.95">of Eve 18 would have been the morrow</text>
  <text start="668.369" dur="3.27">after the Sabbath which according to</text>
  <text start="670.019" dur="8.25">Leviticus 23 that is the feast of</text>
  <text start="671.639" dur="9.771">firstfruits feast of firstfruits and so</text>
  <text start="678.269" dur="5.641">what happened was he is in the grave on</text>
  <text start="681.41" dur="3.76">Wednesday night Thursday night and</text>
  <text start="683.91" dur="5.989">Friday night so there&amp;#39;s your three</text>

  <text start="693.6" dur="4.949">Saturday so there&amp;#39;s your three days</text>
  <text start="695.97" dur="5.219">three days and three nights so he</text>
  <text start="698.549" dur="4.571">actually rises from the grave on Sabbath</text>
  <text start="701.189" dur="3.761">on Shabbat a beef 17</text>
  <text start="703.12" dur="5.76">when he actually rises from the grave</text>
  <text start="704.95" dur="5.19">before before the the day ends at night</text>
  <text start="708.88" dur="4.26">because he&amp;#39;s already been in the grave</text>
  <text start="710.14" dur="5.88">three nights and Saturday will fulfill</text>
  <text start="713.14" dur="4.35">the third day and so just as Shabbat is</text>

  <text start="724.45" dur="3.93">left the grave and so early on the first</text>
  <text start="726.55" dur="3.66">day of the week Abbey 18 which would</text>
  <text start="728.38" dur="4.94">have been the feast of firstfruits so I</text>
  <text start="730.21" dur="3.11">would have been early Sunday morning</text>
  <text start="733.65" dur="9.25">back here and so early Sunday morning on</text>
  <text start="737.95" dur="10.8">the feast of firstfruits that&amp;#39;s when the</text>
  <text start="742.9" dur="9.11">women discover the empty tomb and and</text>
  <text start="748.75" dur="5.339">then they actually meet Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="752.01" dur="4.57">firstfruits is really interesting</text>
  <text start="754.089" dur="5.431">because on when that when the high</text>
  <text start="756.58" dur="4.11">priest gathers all the barley from the</text>
  <text start="759.52" dur="2.61">people that have brought their first</text>
