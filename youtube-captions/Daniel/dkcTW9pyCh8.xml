  <text start="8.429" dur="5.67">Sabbath day Saturday morning December</text>
  <text start="10.65" dur="11.91">15th 2018 I love you turn down the music</text>
  <text start="14.099" dur="9.961">here this is a teaching that could be a</text>
  <text start="22.56" dur="3.41">very long one&amp;#39;s extensive one it</text>
  <text start="24.06" dur="5.369">basically comes from a lot of study</text>
  <text start="25.97" dur="6.24">taking the final week of Jesus Christ</text>
  <text start="29.429" dur="5.571">Yahshua the Messiah is life and</text>
  <text start="32.21" dur="5.08">overplaying it prophetically now</text>
  <text start="35" dur="4.45">remember this is all predicated on the</text>
  <text start="37.29" dur="5.94">fact that my theory about the two solar</text>
  <text start="39.45" dur="6.69">eclipses is correct that the one in 2017</text>
  <text start="43.23" dur="6.54">at 2:24 2024 mark the final seven years</text>
  <text start="46.14" dur="4.82">of America and then in 2024 we begin the</text>
  <text start="49.77" dur="4.14">three-and-a-half year Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="50.96" dur="4.689">there are several studies I&amp;#39;ve done to</text>
  <text start="53.91" dur="4.559">lay a foundation for this one and in</text>
  <text start="55.649" dur="5.521">fact I will show the the list of those</text>
  <text start="58.469" dur="5.191">studies from my laptop here and if you</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="7.47">have not watched these studies then you</text>
  <text start="63.66" dur="6.69">probably should go watch them especially</text>
  <text start="68.64" dur="3.99">the first one which is prophecy</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="5.01">pedophiles Trump x marks the spot</text>
  <text start="72.63" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s the you&amp;#39;ve got to absolutely</text>
  <text start="75.36" dur="3.09">watch that one before you consider</text>
  <text start="76.35" dur="5.76">watching this video but then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="5.58">several sequels the one after that is</text>
  <text start="82.11" dur="5.009">called Philadelphia two witnesses</text>
  <text start="84.03" dur="4.949">trumpets and President Trump then the</text>
  <text start="87.119" dur="3.721">next one is who is the real son of</text>
  <text start="88.979" dur="4.68">perdition that was the Shabbat teaching</text>
  <text start="90.84" dur="5.55">I did then the next one is Book of</text>
  <text start="93.659" dur="6.42">Daniel Trump solar eclipse from 2024 to</text>
  <text start="96.39" dur="5.909">2027 the next one I&amp;#39;m for that is 2300</text>
  <text start="100.079" dur="4.981">days in Daniel chapter 8 Trump and</text>
  <text start="102.299" dur="4.021">prophecy the next one after that is the</text>
  <text start="105.06" dur="5.25">beast with 10 horns</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="6.299">2024 to 2027 the next one after that is</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="6.57">called Philadelphia Smyrna and prophecy</text>
  <text start="112.619" dur="6.121">the way of escape then I got a</text>
  <text start="116.88" dur="3.54">two-parter that fits in right after that</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="3.57">which is called seven seals seven</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="4.979">trumpets seven thunders seven bulls</text>
  <text start="122.31" dur="5.159">revelation and then part two which is a</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="4.381">separate video part two seven seals</text>
  <text start="127.469" dur="5.611">seven trumpets seventh of seven thunder</text>
  <text start="129.78" dur="5.4">seven bulls revelation and the final one</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="4.86">the seven mountains the horse sits upon</text>
  <text start="135.18" dur="6.57">multiple layers so those are all</text>
  <text start="137.94" dur="6.09">teachings that I&amp;#39;ve done again even if</text>
  <text start="141.75" dur="5.97">the dates may not be correct the</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="6.38">sequence of events are so I&amp;#39;m gonna put</text>
  <text start="147.72" dur="6.03">this out here hope it will edify you</text>
  <text start="150.41" dur="5.32">again the point of these prophetic</text>
  <text start="153.75" dur="3.45">teachings it&amp;#39;s not to impress you or</text>
  <text start="155.73" dur="2.73">it&amp;#39;s not to be like oh this is so cool</text>
  <text start="157.2" dur="3.96">to talk about even though it is cool to</text>
  <text start="158.46" dur="4.35">talk about but it&amp;#39;s the point is that</text>
  <text start="161.16" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;re to get as close to Messiah as</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="4.35">possible we&amp;#39;re going to if we&amp;#39;re living</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="3.93">in sin we need to repent forsake that</text>
  <text start="167.16" dur="4.2">and get get to the feet of Messiah and</text>
  <text start="169.11" dur="3.9">have his blood washes his spirit Phyllis</text>
  <text start="171.36" dur="3.75">if we are believers that we&amp;#39;re drawing</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="4.32">closer to him because it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="4.38">so key to have as an intimate</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="3.81">relationship with Messiah as possible as</text>
  <text start="179.49" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re going through these next several</text>
  <text start="181.14" dur="4.14">years but you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="3.12">misinformation out there on the internet</text>
  <text start="185.28" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s a lot of false prophets there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.05" dur="3.03">a lot of like thing people saying this</text>
  <text start="188.73" dur="2.67">and that and everything and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="190.08" dur="4.32">try to keep this as scriptural as</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="5.73">possible again as always compare what I</text>
  <text start="194.4" dur="4.47">say to what the scripture says because</text>
  <text start="197.13" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s what the Breen&amp;#39;s did with Apostle</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="4.23">Paul Paul would teach them and expound</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="4.05">to them upon the Torah and how it</text>
  <text start="203.1" dur="3.42">relates to the Messiah and the Bereans</text>
  <text start="204.93" dur="2.85">were very noble it says in the book of</text>
  <text start="206.52" dur="3.99">Acts because they would compare</text>
  <text start="207.78" dur="4.74">diligently anything Paul said with the</text>
  <text start="210.51" dur="3.75">scriptures that they have so that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="212.52" dur="6.39">what we need to be doing okay let me</text>
  <text start="214.26" dur="6.9">grab my marker here and again this is</text>
  <text start="218.91" dur="4.13">gonna be a rather lengthy teaching but I</text>
  <text start="221.16" dur="4.59">saved these types of stuff for a survive</text>
  <text start="223.04" dur="4.449">when I take a break from all the satanic</text>
  <text start="225.75" dur="4.92">cut a file and child sex trafficking</text>

  <text start="240.239" dur="11.421">final week of Joshua&amp;#39;s life on Thursday</text>
  <text start="252.14" dur="8.529">which I&amp;#39;m saying is equal to 2018 the</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="7.2">year were in right now Yahshua visited</text>
  <text start="260.669" dur="5.051">Bethany which is a small town close to</text>
  <text start="264.6" dur="4.45">Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="265.72" dur="7.08">and Bethany the name of Bethany means a</text>
  <text start="269.05" dur="7.68">fig tree for figs pure fix the pure figs</text>
  <text start="272.8" dur="5.01">and he was there at the house of Lazarus</text>
  <text start="276.73" dur="2.64">with the resurrection of Lazarus</text>
  <text start="277.81" dur="4.41">occurred if you don&amp;#39;t know that story</text>
  <text start="279.37" dur="6.27">where Lazarus had been dead even dead</text>
  <text start="282.22" dur="5.76">and Yahshua called him forth and he came</text>
  <text start="285.64" dur="4.28">out of the tomb so this was also about a</text>
  <text start="287.98" dur="7.59">resurrection he was there for two days</text>
  <text start="289.92" dur="9.46">Thursday and Friday which Friday I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="295.57" dur="7.05">saying equals 2019 and so we see a</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="6.18">resurrection of Lazarus we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="302.62" dur="8.55">the true things and the resurrection of</text>
  <text start="305.56" dur="7.26">Lazarus basically a revival a renewal an</text>
  <text start="311.17" dur="4.07">awakening like we&amp;#39;ve already been seen</text>
  <text start="312.82" dur="4.65">and Awakening even more particularly of</text>
  <text start="315.24" dur="4.96">the church although I don&amp;#39;t like to use</text>
  <text start="317.47" dur="5.25">that term true believers who are filled</text>
  <text start="320.2" dur="4.71">the spirit covered his blood walking in</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="4.29">the Torah says in the scriptures those</text>
  <text start="324.91" dur="5.73">who return to the ancient paths will</text>
  <text start="327.01" dur="5.52">find rest for the Souls and Messiah said</text>
  <text start="330.64" dur="3.63">very clearly in Matthew five I had come</text>
  <text start="332.53" dur="3.87">not to abolish the Torah</text>
  <text start="334.27" dur="3.99">I&amp;#39;ve not cut them all in fact Hebrews</text>
  <text start="336.4" dur="3.81">eight in the Christian New Testament</text>
  <text start="338.26" dur="2.76">which is quoting directly from Jeremiah</text>
  <text start="340.21" dur="3.63">31:31</text>
  <text start="341.02" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s all about him writing his Torah his</text>
  <text start="343.84" dur="3.45">laws his instructions on her hearts in</text>
  <text start="345.46" dur="3.51">her minds through his blood by his</text>
  <text start="347.29" dur="4.31">Spirit that&amp;#39;s the new cover so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.97" dur="5.04">seeing a resurrection of an awakening in</text>
  <text start="351.6" dur="4.2">2018-2019 not just of that but if so</text>
  <text start="354.01" dur="5.31">many things that are coming out to light</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="5.43">with 911 with the bush cabal with all</text>
  <text start="359.32" dur="6.27">this stuff it&amp;#39;s all coming out in</text>

  <text start="368.35" dur="4.08">Center on the Illuminati and the evil</text>
  <text start="370.21" dur="6">things but if you go farther back to the</text>
  <text start="372.43" dur="5.82">Puritans and the pilgrims back in the</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="4.83">1600s before the United States was ever</text>
  <text start="378.25" dur="4.74">formed these guys understood the Torah</text>
  <text start="381.04" dur="4.23">the pilgrims actually kept the feast of</text>
  <text start="382.99" dur="6.15">Sukkot with the Native Americans they</text>
  <text start="385.27" dur="6.72">did and George Washington and his men</text>

  <text start="393.85" dur="3.75">celebrating the pagan feast of Christmas</text>
  <text start="395.59" dur="4.71">was it in their culture but the British</text>
  <text start="397.6" dur="6.15">were and because George Washington&amp;#39;s men</text>
  <text start="400.3" dur="5.37">ambushed the British on Christmas Eve it</text>
  <text start="403.75" dur="3.33">was such a design decisive victory for</text>
  <text start="405.67" dur="2.67">the Americans that had literally turned</text>
  <text start="407.08" dur="4.08">the entire tide of the war and</text>
  <text start="408.34" dur="4.56">eventually led to Americans being</text>
  <text start="411.16" dur="4.77">victorious in the American Revolution so</text>
  <text start="412.9" dur="4.92">a lot of stuff speed was stored and</text>

  <text start="436.72" dur="4.35">it was a Shabbat it was a Sabbath day I</text>
  <text start="439.57" dur="3.15">can prove that through Scripture this is</text>
  <text start="441.07" dur="4.5">all by the way taking the four gospel</text>
  <text start="442.72" dur="5.52">counsin but we had Palm Sabbath a</text>

  <text start="475.78" dur="9.09">later next we have a first aid week</text>
  <text start="480.94" dur="6">Sunday and by the way Yahshua actually</text>
  <text start="484.87" dur="5.34">goes into the temple and wrecks the</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="4.44">temple okay on Shabbat they&amp;#39;re violating</text>
  <text start="490.21" dur="2.67">Shabbat with all their buying and</text>
  <text start="491.38" dur="3.15">selling and the temple sitting even be a</text>
  <text start="492.88" dur="2.82">place where they&amp;#39;re doing it anyway but</text>
  <text start="494.53" dur="3.53">he does that but there&amp;#39;s actually two</text>
  <text start="495.7" dur="5.67">different incidences where that happens</text>
  <text start="498.06" dur="6.42">but that&amp;#39;s one of them anyway</text>
  <text start="501.37" dur="9.41">[Music]</text>
  <text start="504.48" dur="6.3">on Sunday Yahshua curses the fig tree</text>
  <text start="511.47" dur="5.62">because it&amp;#39;s not bearing any fruit and</text>
  <text start="514.21" dur="4.56">this is representative of the year 2021</text>
  <text start="517.09" dur="5.03">where if you go back to my video about</text>
  <text start="518.77" dur="8.76">the 2300 days of Daniel if I&amp;#39;m correct</text>
  <text start="522.12" dur="7.39">about his return in 2027 then 2021 would</text>
  <text start="527.53" dur="4.05">be the beginning of those 2300 days has</text>
  <text start="529.51" dur="5.03">talked about in Daniel chapter 8 and so</text>
  <text start="531.58" dur="5.4">this is when we would see the temple</text>
  <text start="534.54" dur="4.18">fully rebuilt in Jerusalem with the</text>
  <text start="536.98" dur="3.32">animal sacrifices and again this is a</text>
  <text start="538.72" dur="5.37">temple we should have nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="540.3" dur="6.13">nothing to do with Isaiah 66 talks about</text>
  <text start="544.09" dur="4.02">this apostate temple there will be a</text>
  <text start="546.43" dur="3.78">real temple of the Millennium but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.11" dur="4.05">after we get caught up to be with Jesus</text>
  <text start="550.21" dur="3.93">with Yahshua in the clouds or our</text>
  <text start="552.16" dur="5.19">resurrected bodies we return with him at</text>
  <text start="554.14" dur="4.98">a later time but when we&amp;#39;re on earth</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="3.21">here on earth we as believers we&amp;#39;re to</text>
  <text start="559.12" dur="6.41">stay away from this temple because it</text>
  <text start="560.56" dur="7.89">will be polluted by the son of perdition</text>
  <text start="565.53" dur="6.31">so just as he also cursed the fig tree</text>
  <text start="568.45" dur="5.07">on that Sunday so this represents 2021</text>
  <text start="571.84" dur="4.47">where we should see the temple</text>
  <text start="573.52" dur="4.56">sacrifices beginning actually begins on</text>
  <text start="576.31" dur="3.57">June 14th which somebody pointed out to</text>
  <text start="578.08" dur="3.48">me who&amp;#39;s president Trump&amp;#39;s birthday but</text>

  <text start="596.98" dur="3.57">rehearsal by the way at this altar</text>
  <text start="598.87" dur="3.51">that&amp;#39;s just our CIL&amp;#39;s not the real</text>
  <text start="600.55" dur="3.9">thing guys don&amp;#39;t get all excited to uh</text>
  <text start="602.38" dur="9.72">say uh look the first I was here no it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="623.44" dur="8.16">trees all dried up on that Monday and</text>
  <text start="626.579" dur="9.281">this represents the Year 2022 by the way</text>
  <text start="631.6" dur="6.66">this is also when Yahshua expounds on</text>
  <text start="635.86" dur="4.7">Matthew 24 which is all about the end</text>
  <text start="638.26" dur="2.3">times</text>

  <text start="767.74" dur="6">you&amp;#39;ve seen my previous studies is the</text>
  <text start="771.64" dur="3.18">year of that solar eclipse in which I</text>
  <text start="773.74" dur="3.72">believe the Great Tribulation begins</text>
  <text start="774.82" dur="5.37">this is where the abomination of</text>
  <text start="777.46" dur="5.22">desolation would happen and the son of</text>
  <text start="780.19" dur="4.44">perdition would basically fill that</text>
  <text start="782.68" dur="4.71">Temple in Jerusalem that&amp;#39;s been starting</text>
  <text start="784.63" dur="4.59">sacrifices waste since 2021 that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="787.39" dur="3.3">the abomination of desolation happens so</text>
  <text start="789.22" dur="3.53">it corresponds with that Wednesday</text>
  <text start="790.69" dur="5.94">Passover where the ash was cut off and</text>
  <text start="792.75" dur="6.4">that&amp;#39;s 2024 that&amp;#39;s when that solar</text>
  <text start="796.63" dur="3.75">eclipse occurs on April 8 2000 24 7</text>
  <text start="799.15" dur="6.63">years after the one that occurred in</text>
  <text start="800.38" dur="7.41">August of 2017 a ring there now Yahshua</text>
  <text start="805.78" dur="3.18">was then buried remember he said he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="807.79" dur="3.63">given here three days and three nights</text>
  <text start="808.96" dur="3.48">so he&amp;#39;s taken off the cross on Wednesday</text>
  <text start="811.42" dur="3.69">they got to get them off the cross</text>
  <text start="812.44" dur="3.84">because that night begins the first day</text>
  <text start="815.11" dur="4.89">of unleavened bread which is a high</text>
  <text start="816.28" dur="4.95">Shabbat so he&amp;#39;s put in the grave on</text>
  <text start="820" dur="3.48">Wednesday night Thursday night Friday</text>
  <text start="821.23" dur="3.87">night all day Thursday all day Friday</text>
  <text start="823.48" dur="4.5">all day Saturday three days and three</text>
  <text start="825.1" dur="8.36">nights so basically for the next three</text>
  <text start="827.98" dur="9.44">years which is going to be 2025 2026 and</text>
  <text start="833.46" dur="9.43">2027 where Yahshua is buried on that</text>
  <text start="837.42" dur="7.21">Thursday Friday and Shabbat when he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="842.89" dur="5.01">buried this is when the three and a half</text>
  <text start="844.63" dur="5.04">year Tribulation is going on those who</text>
  <text start="847.9" dur="3.51">grabbed the whole of the Philadelphian</text>
  <text start="849.67" dur="3.84">revelation 12 promise which I talked</text>
  <text start="851.41" dur="3.75">about in previous videos they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="853.51" dur="3.93">undisclosed safe place in the wilderness</text>
  <text start="855.16" dur="3.9">and those who did not get there the</text>
  <text start="857.44" dur="3.27">center perdition is persecuting and</text>
  <text start="859.06" dur="4.77">cutting off their heads</text>
  <text start="860.71" dur="4.349">the very guillotines used to do public</text>
  <text start="863.83" dur="2.669">executions against these</text>
  <text start="865.059" dur="3.3">Satanic pedophiles if that&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="866.499" dur="3.99">what&amp;#39;s going to happen will then be used</text>
  <text start="868.359" dur="3.78">for nefarious purposes to cut off the</text>
  <text start="870.489" dur="4.22">heads of the Saints those who truly love</text>
  <text start="872.139" dur="6.51">y&amp;#39;all so this is the great tribulation</text>
  <text start="874.709" dur="5.89">the great tribulation which began in the</text>
  <text start="878.649" dur="4.02">spring of 2024 we see it going through</text>
  <text start="880.599" dur="4.62">here for three and a half years 42</text>
  <text start="882.669" dur="6.24">months 1260 days it&amp;#39;s talked about all</text>
  <text start="885.219" dur="6.96">through revelation 11 in the book of</text>
  <text start="888.909" dur="4.92">Revelation and then of course three and</text>
  <text start="892.179" dur="3.45">a half years if you start in the spring</text>
  <text start="893.829" dur="5.3">of twenty four it terminates in the fall</text>
  <text start="895.629" dur="5.58">feasts 2027 remember Jesus fulfilled the</text>
  <text start="899.129" dur="5.08">spring feasts he was murdered on</text>
  <text start="901.209" dur="5.82">Passover he was buried during the Living</text>
  <text start="904.209" dur="4.41">bread he arose resurrection and wave</text>
  <text start="907.029" dur="3.21">himself as the first to shore among the</text>
  <text start="908.619" dur="4.17">dead before the Father on the feast of</text>
  <text start="910.239" dur="4.41">firstfruits which always happens on the</text>
  <text start="912.789" dur="3.78">first day of the week fifty days later</text>
  <text start="914.649" dur="4.77">the Holy Spirit the rock hunger - fell</text>
  <text start="916.569" dur="5.55">upon the 120 gathered in the upper room</text>
  <text start="919.419" dur="4.23">in Jerusalem to fill Shavuot Pentecost</text>
  <text start="922.119" dur="3.84">so those spring feasts were all</text>
  <text start="923.649" dur="5.25">fulfilled 2,000 years ago but the fall</text>
  <text start="925.959" dur="4.38">feasts have not yet been fulfilled so</text>
  <text start="928.899" dur="4.26">the first of the fall feasts that&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="930.339" dur="5.04">the prophetic timeline is trumpets the</text>
  <text start="933.159" dur="4.11">Jews called Rosh Hashanah Yom taurua the</text>
  <text start="935.379" dur="4.08">Peace of shouting the trumpets is the</text>
  <text start="937.269" dur="6.45">next one to be fulfilled so when we get</text>
  <text start="939.459" dur="6.69">to the fall of 2027 that is when again</text>
  <text start="943.719" dur="3.12">if my theory is correct about these two</text>
  <text start="946.149" dur="3.06">solar eclipses</text>
  <text start="946.839" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s in the fall 2027 we should see</text>
  <text start="949.209" dur="3.69">the the seventh trumpet resurrection or</text>
  <text start="951.459" dur="3.27">what the Christians call the raptures of</text>
  <text start="952.899" dur="4.22">course we don&amp;#39;t know the day or the hour</text>
  <text start="954.729" dur="4.68">because it could happen anytime between</text>
  <text start="957.119" dur="4.18">yom teruah Feast of Trumpets and Yom</text>
  <text start="959.409" dur="2.88">Kippur in the days of the seventh</text>
  <text start="961.299" dur="2.49">trumpet as that&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="962.289" dur="3.9">revelation 10 we don&amp;#39;t know they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="963.789" dur="4.02">hour well no the year once the</text>
  <text start="966.189" dur="3.24">abomination of desolation goes down</text>
  <text start="967.809" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;ll know the year but we won&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="969.429" dur="3.36">the day or the hour we&amp;#39;ll never know the</text>
  <text start="971.499" dur="3.03">day or the hour because it could happen</text>
  <text start="972.789" dur="3.3">anytime during that period of time of</text>
  <text start="974.529" dur="1.89">the seventh trumpet the days of seventh</text>
  <text start="976.089" dur="2.79">trumpet</text>
  <text start="976.419" dur="3.8">so that would be 2027 that would be of</text>
  <text start="978.879" dur="3.69">course the resurrection of the Messiah</text>
  <text start="980.219" dur="5.2">that occurred just as the Sun was</text>
  <text start="982.569" dur="4.53">setting on Shabbat Yahshua resurrected</text>
  <text start="985.419" dur="3.57">but it wasn&amp;#39;t discovered until that</text>
  <text start="987.099" dur="4.02">Sunday morning first day of the week</text>
  <text start="988.989" dur="4.59">which was the day of firstfruits that</text>
  <text start="991.119" dur="4.08">year and so then we have the</text>
  <text start="993.579" dur="4.301">resurrection and we have the return of</text>
  <text start="995.199" dur="5.381">Messiah so you see how the entire</text>
  <text start="997.88" dur="4.59">final week starting that previous</text>
  <text start="1000.58" dur="3.75">Thursday Friday Shabbat and going</text>
  <text start="1002.47" dur="7.17">through the next whole week how that all</text>
  <text start="1004.33" dur="7.56">lines up with 2018 2019 2020 21 22 23 24</text>
  <text start="1009.64" dur="5.37">then the three 90 or tribulation from</text>
  <text start="1011.89" dur="4.86">the spring of 2024 to the fall 2027 if</text>
  <text start="1015.01" dur="3.81">those two solar eclipses is the way I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1016.75" dur="5.3">interpreting it is correct so I just</text>
  <text start="1018.82" dur="6.72">wanted to present this as a teaching</text>
  <text start="1022.05" dur="4.63">Leviticus 23 is a really good place to</text>
  <text start="1025.54" dur="3.09">start if you&amp;#39;re wanting to learn about</text>
