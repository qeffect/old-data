  <text start="94.409" dur="6.57">interesting as they did this just</text>

  <text start="100.979" dur="5.161">echoing I did that article our Sue&amp;#39;s me</text>
  <text start="104.579" dur="3.601">I did that video just a few days ago</text>
  <text start="106.14" dur="4.86">last week about president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="108.18" dur="5.85">signing into law the federal government</text>
  <text start="111" dur="5.159">mandating restitution for child</text>

  <text start="120.869" dur="3.061">sex trafficking all through the United</text>
  <text start="122.28" dur="3.24">States and now here we have the</text>
  <text start="123.93" dur="3.96">archdiocese to the Roman Catholic Church</text>
  <text start="125.52" dur="4.2">within the United States trying to</text>
  <text start="127.89" dur="4.92">shield their assets and not allow</text>
  <text start="129.72" dur="5.49">victims to to get those ass</text>
  <text start="132.81" dur="3.66">and so so I think president Trump</text>
  <text start="135.21" dur="3.6">probably knew about this and is</text>
  <text start="136.47" dur="5.46">basically trumping them no pun intended</text>
  <text start="138.81" dur="5.34">okay so in March the archdiocese</text>
  <text start="141.93" dur="4.41">established money real estate holdings a</text>
  <text start="144.15" dur="5.13">501 C 3 corporations solely under the</text>
  <text start="146.34" dur="4.74">ownership of Allan Vig veteran now</text>
  <text start="149.28" dur="4.44">remember there has been a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="151.08" dur="5.01">abuse with these 501 3 C&amp;#39;s C threes in</text>
  <text start="153.72" dur="5.01">fact that&amp;#39;s what that testimony was</text>
  <text start="156.09" dur="4.5">about last week on Capitol Hill where</text>
  <text start="158.73" dur="3.21">there it was a review of the Clinton</text>
  <text start="160.59" dur="3.69">Foundation how they&amp;#39;ve completely</text>
  <text start="161.94" dur="4.11">violated not only the 501 C 3 but</text>
  <text start="164.28" dur="3.63">basically making a hybrid of both a</text>
  <text start="166.05" dur="4.59">private foundation and a public charity</text>
  <text start="167.91" dur="4.29">which is illegal and so these guys are</text>
  <text start="170.64" dur="3.03">doing the same thing the purpose of the</text>
  <text start="172.2" dur="3.63">corporation among other things is to</text>
  <text start="173.67" dur="4.17">acquire owned disposed of and deal with</text>
  <text start="175.83" dur="3.9">real and personal property of the</text>

  <text start="181.59" dur="3.47">major seminary as well as quote other</text>
  <text start="183.51" dur="3.86">religious charitable and educational</text>
  <text start="185.06" dur="4.06">organizations within the archdiocese</text>
  <text start="187.37" dur="3.67">according to the Articles of</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="4.62">Incorporation the sole member of the</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="4.22">corporation is ex officio the archbishop</text>
  <text start="193.74" dur="4.2">of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese</text>
  <text start="195.26" dur="5.44">Diocese of Detroit membership is not</text>
  <text start="197.94" dur="5.43">transferable the rules explicitly</text>
  <text start="200.7" dur="4.59">disallow mooney real estate holdings</text>
  <text start="203.37" dur="4.02">from filing for bankruptcy or giving</text>
  <text start="205.29" dur="5.34">money to creditors without the expressed</text>
  <text start="207.39" dur="5.55">written approval of archbishop ignorant</text>
  <text start="210.63" dur="4.5">in practical terms this means parishes</text>
  <text start="212.94" dur="4.11">schools and all other property</text>
  <text start="215.13" dur="3.36">traditionally owned by the archdiocese</text>
  <text start="217.05" dur="3.27">will no longer be owned by the</text>
  <text start="218.49" dur="3.72">archdiocese but rather by the archbishop</text>
  <text start="220.32" dur="4.17">who has sole authority and power to</text>
  <text start="222.21" dur="3.87">direct the assets as he wills church</text>
  <text start="224.49" dur="3.15">militant has confirmed that the</text>
  <text start="226.08" dur="3.39">archdiocese has already started</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="4.23">transferring millions of dollars in</text>
  <text start="229.47" dur="4.98">assets to mooney real estate holdings</text>
  <text start="231.87" dur="5.46">preventing creditors and others like</text>
  <text start="234.45" dur="5.52">victims of sexual abuse or satanic</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="4.29">pedophile survivors in the archdiocese</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="4.26">from reaching any of the assets and</text>
  <text start="241.62" dur="4.11">legal settlements Church Milton is also</text>
  <text start="244.23" dur="3.9">confirmed that the archdiocese is</text>
  <text start="245.73" dur="3.84">establishing each individual parish as</text>
  <text start="248.13" dur="3.6">its own corporation</text>
  <text start="249.57" dur="4.04">another method of shielding assets from</text>
  <text start="251.73" dur="3.63">the reach of sex abuse lawsuits</text>
  <text start="253.61" dur="3.34">traditionally abuse victims have been</text>
  <text start="255.36" dur="3.93">able to sue the priests as well as the</text>
  <text start="256.95" dur="3.87">archdiocese under the new regime in</text>
  <text start="259.29" dur="2.89">Detroit this will no longer be possible</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="3.43">now this</text>
  <text start="262.18" dur="5.489">not taking to account what Trump signed</text>
  <text start="264.25" dur="5.009">into law last week so remember that the</text>
  <text start="267.669" dur="3.211">abuse victim may only sue the priests in</text>
  <text start="269.259" dur="3.271">the parish where he ministered the</text>
  <text start="270.88" dur="5.159">Detroit archdiocese will be out of reach</text>
  <text start="272.53" dur="5.31">along with its millions in assets</text>
  <text start="276.039" dur="3.481">the Detroit archdiocese is the subject</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="3.27">of a criminal investigation by the state</text>
  <text start="279.52" dur="4.019">attorney general which rated the</text>
  <text start="281.11" dur="6.45">Chancery on October 3rd so this would</text>
  <text start="283.539" dur="6.141">have been due to do five four days</text>
  <text start="287.56" dur="4.44">before Trump signed that bill into law</text>
  <text start="289.68" dur="4.09">gathering documents from the archdiocese</text>
  <text start="292" dur="3.449">secret archives these archives hold</text>
  <text start="293.77" dur="4.709">confidential records of clerical</text>
  <text start="295.449" dur="5.131">misconduct including sex abuse the</text>
  <text start="298.479" dur="4.111">investigation is and will continue to be</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="3.809">independent thorough transparent and</text>
  <text start="302.59" dur="3.96">prompt said Bill Schuette in a statement</text>
  <text start="304.389" dur="3.631">in August my department and this</text>
  <text start="306.55" dur="4.799">investigation will find out who knew</text>
  <text start="308.02" dur="4.86">what and win so unless you continue to</text>
  <text start="311.349" dur="3.451">read this article but basically and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="312.88" dur="3.18">post this right below the video so</text>
  <text start="314.8" dur="3.209">they&amp;#39;re trying to shield their assets</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re trying to not allow this money</text>
  <text start="318.009" dur="6.44">to go to satanic pedophilia ritual abuse</text>
  <text start="321.43" dur="6.54">survivors that have been blatantly</text>
  <text start="324.449" dur="7.181">abused by the archdiocese here in in</text>
  <text start="327.97" dur="5.49">Detroit but again they did all this</text>
  <text start="331.63" dur="4.529">before Trump signed this bill into law</text>
  <text start="333.46" dur="4.56">which by the way that law I believe and</text>
  <text start="336.159" dur="3.391">I don&amp;#39;t quote me on this but I believe</text>
  <text start="338.02" dur="2.99">that law is retroactive I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s gonna basically go back</text>
  <text start="341.01" dur="4.75">backwards in time not just forwards in</text>
  <text start="343.36" dur="4.2">time so I don&amp;#39;t think that they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="345.76" dur="4.379">be able to ultimately shield their</text>
  <text start="347.56" dur="6.78">assets and in fact I know that as far</text>
  <text start="350.139" dur="6.661">back as last spring President Trump</text>
  <text start="354.34" dur="4.56">having learned about a lot of just the</text>
  <text start="356.8" dur="3.869">utter depravity going on within the</text>
  <text start="358.9" dur="3.96">Roman Catholic Church literally starts</text>
  <text start="360.669" dur="4.111">sending a team county-by-county</text>
  <text start="362.86" dur="3.45">throughout the United States doing deep</text>
  <text start="364.78" dur="4.29">investigations and this was all around</text>
  <text start="366.31" dur="4.859">if you remember the story about the the</text>
  <text start="369.07" dur="4.2">300 priests in Pennsylvania that</text>
  <text start="371.169" dur="4.021">basically have indictments on them now</text>
  <text start="373.27" dur="4.2">because of you know how long they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="375.19" dur="4.71">been abusing and sexually molesting</text>
  <text start="377.47" dur="3.689">young boys young girls and in response</text>
  <text start="379.9" dur="2.87">to that President Trump literally</text>
  <text start="381.159" dur="3.901">started going sending his people</text>
  <text start="382.77" dur="5.619">county-by-county again this is not</text>
  <text start="385.06" dur="5.909">reported in the mainstream news but well</text>
  <text start="388.389" dur="4.5">we shouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised by that so I</text>
  <text start="390.969" dur="3.101">will post this article right below the</text>
  <text start="392.889" dur="4.451">video</text>
