  <text start="92.61" dur="3.84">published February 21st it would</text>
  <text start="94.47" dur="5.189">eliminate virtually all common-sense</text>
  <text start="96.45" dur="4.77">regulation of abortion he went on to</text>
  <text start="99.659" dur="3.481">urge the people of Illinois and members</text>
  <text start="101.22" dur="4.16">of the General Assembly to vigorously</text>
  <text start="103.14" dur="4.589">and aggressively oppose the measure</text>
  <text start="105.38" dur="5.5">among the things the bill would allow if</text>

  <text start="431.949" dur="4.951">Vietnam with this summit things seemed</text>
  <text start="434.2" dur="4.83">to be going very well again the the</text>
  <text start="436.9" dur="3.84">whole false narrative is to try to make</text>
  <text start="439.03" dur="3.47">it seem like he&amp;#39;s this war president and</text>
  <text start="440.74" dur="6.179">all he&amp;#39;s been doing actually is</text>
  <text start="442.5" dur="6.1">bolstering peace remember under Obama we</text>
  <text start="446.919" dur="4.47">thought we were gonna go to nuclear war</text>
  <text start="448.6" dur="4.53">with North Korea and under george w bush</text>
  <text start="451.389" dur="3.211">and other other successive presidents</text>
  <text start="453.13" dur="2.94">that the tension is just ratcheted</text>
  <text start="454.6" dur="3.18">higher and higher and higher and when</text>
  <text start="456.07" dur="4.2">President Trump first came to office a</text>
  <text start="457.78" dur="4.199">lot of us even then follow my goodness</text>
  <text start="460.27" dur="3.24">now we&amp;#39;re really gonna go to war but of</text>
  <text start="461.979" dur="4.201">course that&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s happened and</text>
  <text start="463.51" dur="4.71">the distraction by the MSM of course is</text>
  <text start="466.18" dur="3.93">to have Michael Cohen who Michael Cohen</text>
  <text start="468.22" dur="4.68">I&amp;#39;ll just read president Trump&amp;#39;s tweet</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="5.7">Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers</text>
  <text start="472.9" dur="5.22">who represented me unfortunately he had</text>
  <text start="475.81" dur="4.26">other clients also he was just disbarred</text>
  <text start="478.12" dur="4.5">by the state Supreme Court for lying and</text>
  <text start="480.07" dur="4.68">fraud he did bad things unrelated to</text>
  <text start="482.62" dur="4.97">Trump he is lying in order to reduce his</text>
  <text start="484.75" dur="4.979">prison time using crooked lawyers</text>
  <text start="487.59" dur="3.79">remember President Donald Trump I think</text>
  <text start="489.729" dur="4.171">because he has completely submitted</text>
  <text start="491.38" dur="4.74">himself to ya&amp;#39; and he&amp;#39;s doing what Yost</text>
  <text start="493.9" dur="3.93">told him to do he&amp;#39;s known as Teflon Don</text>
  <text start="496.12" dur="2.91">so the things are just bouncing off of</text>
  <text start="497.83" dur="3.42">him so this is not going to affect him</text>
  <text start="499.03" dur="4.23">at all just like with the whole Acosta</text>
