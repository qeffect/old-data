  <text start="4.02" dur="3.69">5th first day of the week day after</text>
  <text start="5.73" dur="4.17">Shabbat this is daniel john lee with</text>
  <text start="7.71" dur="4.469">tour restoration ministries making this</text>
  <text start="9.9" dur="5.9">video the riddle King Cyrus Daniels 70</text>
  <text start="12.179" dur="12.151">weeks and i&amp;#39;m doing a corrected version</text>
  <text start="15.8" dur="11.649">because my changed rather and sub 2 to</text>
  <text start="24.33" dur="5.25">create this new video so originally what</text>
  <text start="27.449" dur="4.141">I believe was that course that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="29.58" dur="7.61">was going to return in 2017 the next</text>
  <text start="31.59" dur="5.6">Jubilee and that that did not happen</text>
  <text start="42.22" dur="9.33">so I eyes my opinion to believe now that</text>
  <text start="48.79" dur="6.12">the Great Tribulation Rebbe 2017 the</text>
  <text start="51.55" dur="4.98">Jubilee actually begins and that the</text>
  <text start="54.91" dur="3.33">final three and a half years or the</text>
  <text start="56.53" dur="4.02">Great Tribulation subscribe revelation</text>
  <text start="58.24" dur="4.86">occurs from the spring of 2017 until the</text>
  <text start="60.55" dur="3.48">fall 2020 not only is that the three and</text>
  <text start="63.1" dur="3.48">a half years of the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="64.03" dur="6.15">but it&amp;#39;s the final half of Daniels</text>
  <text start="66.58" dur="5.25">seventh week the first half I believe</text>
  <text start="70.18" dur="5.16">occurred two thousand years ago during</text>
  <text start="71.83" dur="6.93">yahshua&amp;#39;s ministry from the year 13 ad</text>
  <text start="75.34" dur="7.43">until 1780 now why do I believe that</text>
  <text start="78.76" dur="8.49">well let&amp;#39;s go to Daniel chapter 9 and</text>
  <text start="82.77" dur="6.489">starting in verse 24 so seventy weeks</text>
  <text start="87.25" dur="3.54">are determined upon my people in upon by</text>
  <text start="89.259" dur="3.871">holy city to finish the transgression</text>
  <text start="90.79" dur="4.469">and to make an end of sins and to make</text>
  <text start="93.13" dur="3.81">reconciliation for iniquity and to bring</text>
  <text start="95.259" dur="2.851">in everlasting righteousness into silk</text>
  <text start="96.94" dur="3.84">the vision and prophecy and to anoint</text>
  <text start="98.11" dur="4.98">the most holy that Hebrew word there is</text>
  <text start="100.78" dur="5.46">not literally weeks in Shibuya which</text>
  <text start="103.09" dur="6.03">means 70 weeks of years so literally 490</text>
  <text start="106.24" dur="4.47">years are determined know therefore and</text>
  <text start="109.12" dur="3.75">understand that from the going forth of</text>
  <text start="110.71" dur="5.01">the commandment to restore and to build</text>
  <text start="112.87" dur="4.41">Jerusalem and now again there were two</text>
  <text start="115.72" dur="4.74">different decrees issued by two</text>
  <text start="117.28" dur="7.08">different kings won the first one was</text>
  <text start="120.46" dur="6.66">issued by exert sees the first to</text>
  <text start="124.36" dur="4.259">rebuild the temple that is not the one</text>
  <text start="127.12" dur="4.199">that we want to</text>
  <text start="128.619" dur="6.48">because here it&amp;#39;s a great clip of the</text>
  <text start="131.319" dur="6.59">decree is is issued to rebuild ruse that</text>
  <text start="135.099" dur="7.5">one was not issued for another 20 years</text>
  <text start="137.909" dur="5.681">by his son art exert sees the first so</text>
  <text start="142.599" dur="4.261">that&amp;#39;s the one we want to go by</text>
  <text start="143.59" dur="4.41">sometimes people get confused so know</text>
  <text start="146.86" dur="2.459">therefore and understand that from the</text>
  <text start="148" dur="3.69">going forth of the commandment to</text>
  <text start="149.319" dur="4.441">restore the build ruse ilim unto the</text>
  <text start="151.69" dur="5.43">messiah the prince shall be seven weeks</text>
  <text start="153.76" dur="7.349">or 49 years and threescore in two weeks</text>
  <text start="157.12" dur="5.369">or four hundred thirty-four years the</text>
  <text start="161.109" dur="4.02">street shall be built again on the wall</text>
  <text start="162.489" dur="6.09">even in trouble is time so Daniel right</text>
  <text start="165.129" dur="6.541">here in verse 25 says that there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="168.579" dur="6.151">periods of time between the going forth</text>
  <text start="171.67" dur="5.25">of the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="174.73" dur="4.74">under the Messiah the Prince and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="176.92" dur="4.709">a period of time of seven weeks or 49</text>
  <text start="179.47" dur="4.2">years in a period of sixty-two weeks or</text>
  <text start="181.629" dur="3.601">four and thirty four years so a total of</text>
  <text start="183.67" dur="4.14">four hundred eighty three years from</text>
  <text start="185.23" dur="5.49">this decree that&amp;#39;ll be issued to rebuild</text>
  <text start="187.81" dur="4.62">Jerusalem until the Messiah the Prince</text>
  <text start="190.72" dur="4.199">now notice there&amp;#39;s been no mention of</text>
  <text start="192.43" dur="6.36">Yahshua being cut off Messiah being cut</text>
  <text start="194.919" dur="7.111">off so you cannot possibly end the 69</text>
  <text start="198.79" dur="5.009">weeks when Yahshua is cut off at 70 AD</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="6.889">which is what my timeline originally</text>
  <text start="203.799" dur="5.12">said when I made this a couple years ago</text>
  <text start="209.86" dur="8.31">and so basically what that means is is</text>
  <text start="213.79" dur="6.15">that the 69 weeks has to end in 13 the</text>
  <text start="218.17" dur="3.96">fall of thirteen eighty when he begins</text>
  <text start="219.94" dur="4.41">his ministry because unto messiah the</text>
  <text start="222.13" dur="5.31">prince would mean unto the time when</text>
  <text start="224.35" dur="4.95">people start recognizing Yahshua as the</text>
  <text start="227.44" dur="6.99">Messiah which would be when he starts</text>
  <text start="229.3" dur="7.14">his ministry in the fall of 13 ad well</text>
  <text start="234.43" dur="5.4">my original timeline of course had the</text>
  <text start="236.44" dur="5.58">16 weeks ending in 17 not 13 so that</text>
  <text start="239.83" dur="4.44">violates the text so I have to figure</text>
  <text start="242.02" dur="4.74">out how I can shift the timeline back a</text>
  <text start="244.27" dur="4.98">few years so that that 69 weeks</text>
  <text start="246.76" dur="3.99">terminates in the fall of 13 ad rather</text>
  <text start="249.25" dur="3.45">than spring of 17 because that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="250.75" dur="6.63">only interpretation that will fit this</text>
  <text start="252.7" dur="7.05">text now moving on the next tap is going</text>
  <text start="257.38" dur="4.62">to explain why I believe there is a 2000</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="5.99">year gap between the first half of</text>
  <text start="262" dur="8.01">Daniels 70th week and the last half and</text>
  <text start="265.74" dur="5.59">also keep in mind you have the seven</text>
  <text start="270.01" dur="3.69">year period which I&amp;#39;m about to read</text>
  <text start="271.33" dur="4.2">about the seven year period mentioned in</text>
  <text start="273.7" dur="4.95">the book of Daniel it&amp;#39;s the 70th and</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="5.25">last week of Daniel 70 weeks and you</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="3.42">have it clearly defined in Daniel but</text>
  <text start="280.78" dur="3.59">when you go to the New Testament in</text>
  <text start="282.07" dur="4.89">Revelation there is no seven-year period</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="4.72">go from the beginning of Matthew want</text>
  <text start="286.96" dur="4.44">all at the end of revelation 22 you will</text>
  <text start="289.09" dur="3.69">not find a single mention of a</text>
  <text start="291.4" dur="2.82">seven-year period but you will see</text>
  <text start="292.78" dur="4.139">several mentions of a three and a half</text>
  <text start="294.22" dur="6.35">year period or 42 months or 1260 days</text>
  <text start="296.919" dur="6.031">why is that I believe that because</text>
  <text start="300.57" dur="4.57">between the events of the Book of Daniel</text>
  <text start="302.95" dur="4.17">and the events described in Revelation</text>
  <text start="305.14" dur="4.02">the first half of that seven-year period</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="4.65">was fulfilled in the book in the Gospels</text>
  <text start="309.16" dur="5">by yahshua&amp;#39;s ministry and I believe</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="4.82">that&amp;#39;s the clear answer to that riddle</text>
  <text start="314.16" dur="4.5">so why is there this huge gap well the</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="5.1">gap is talked about right here starting</text>
  <text start="318.66" dur="5.01">in verse 26 and after threescore in two</text>
  <text start="321.69" dur="3.63">weeks so after the 62 weeks which also</text>
  <text start="323.67" dur="4.77">came out to the seven weeks so after</text>
  <text start="325.32" dur="6.03">this 69 week period or four ninety three</text>
  <text start="328.44" dur="4.98">year period Shah Messiah be cut off so</text>
  <text start="331.35" dur="4.44">the 69 weeks clearly have already ended</text>
  <text start="333.42" dur="5.1">when Messiah is cut off its not win it</text>
  <text start="335.79" dur="4.62">ends but it&amp;#39;s after its after it ends so</text>
  <text start="338.52" dur="6.33">that means messiahs cut off sometime in</text>
  <text start="340.41" dur="6.18">the 70th week Messiah is cut off but not</text>
  <text start="344.85" dur="3.45">for himself and the people the prince</text>
  <text start="346.59" dur="3.24">that shall come shall destroy the city</text>
  <text start="348.3" dur="3.36">in the sanctuary and the end thereof</text>
  <text start="349.83" dur="2.82">shall be with flood and under the end of</text>
  <text start="351.66" dur="4.83">the war desolations are determined</text>
  <text start="352.65" dur="5.58">that&amp;#39;s 70 AD so those events clearly</text>
  <text start="356.49" dur="4.08">happened 2,000 years ago it&amp;#39;s describing</text>
  <text start="358.23" dur="4.92">when Yahshua is crucified it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.57" dur="5.15">describing when the general Titus under</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="4.98">the Roman Emperor destroys Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="365.72" dur="4.06">these events all happened 2,000 years</text>
  <text start="368.13" dur="4.41">ago but then if we go to verse 27 it</text>
  <text start="369.78" dur="4.98">says and II Yahshua the Messiah shall</text>
  <text start="372.54" dur="3.66">confirm the covenant with many for one</text>
  <text start="374.76" dur="2.91">week well we know he did that two</text>
  <text start="376.2" dur="3.24">thousand years ago he started confirming</text>
  <text start="377.67" dur="4.35">his covenant when it began his ministry</text>
  <text start="379.44" dur="5.25">in the fall 13 ad he confirmed his</text>
  <text start="382.02" dur="6.24">covenant with his blood when he died on</text>
  <text start="384.69" dur="5.4">the tree in the spring of 1780 but then</text>
  <text start="388.26" dur="3.45">it says and in the midst of the week he</text>
  <text start="390.09" dur="3.2">shall cause the sacrifice and the</text>
  <text start="391.71" dur="6.3">oblation to cease well now wait a minute</text>
  <text start="393.29" dur="6.22">that never happened when Yahshua died or</text>
  <text start="398.01" dur="3.03">when he could burn his covenant he never</text>
  <text start="399.51" dur="3.6">caused the sacrifice and ablation</text>
  <text start="401.04" dur="5.55">disease the sacrifice is continued all</text>
  <text start="403.11" dur="4.65">the way until 70 AD and then it says and</text>
  <text start="406.59" dur="3.78">for the overspreading of abominations</text>
  <text start="407.76" dur="3.93">shall we make a desolate aha here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.37" dur="3.69">talking about the abomination of</text>
  <text start="411.69" dur="3.87">desolation well that hasn&amp;#39;t happened yet</text>
  <text start="414.06" dur="3.859">that&amp;#39;s an event that&amp;#39;s still in the</text>
  <text start="415.56" dur="2.359">future</text>
  <text start="418.42" dur="2.76">and for the overspreading of</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="3.45">abominations he shall make it desolate</text>
  <text start="421.18" dur="3.48">even of the consummation and that</text>
  <text start="423.25" dur="4.35">determined shall be poured upon the</text>
  <text start="424.66" dur="4.8">desolate so verse 26 is clearly talking</text>
  <text start="427.6" dur="4.44">about events that occurred two thousand</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="4.5">years ago the beginning of verse 27</text>
  <text start="432.04" dur="3.96">starts with events that happened 2,000</text>
  <text start="433.96" dur="3.12">years ago but as we continue to read it</text>
  <text start="436" dur="4.2">goes into events that have not yet</text>
  <text start="437.08" dur="5.7">happened so fairly clearly for Daniel 9</text>
  <text start="440.2" dur="5.1">24 to 27 we can establish two things</text>
  <text start="442.78" dur="5.7">number one the first six to nine weeks</text>
  <text start="445.3" dur="5.37">of Daniel 70 weeks go from the decree</text>
  <text start="448.48" dur="4.92">issued to rebuild Jerusalem unto the</text>
  <text start="450.67" dur="6.17">Messiah the Prince which would be unto</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="6.18">when Yahshua begins his ministry and</text>
  <text start="456.84" dur="4.57">number two that there is a time gap</text>
  <text start="459.58" dur="4.11">between the first half of Daniels 70th</text>
  <text start="461.41" dur="5.3">week and the last half of Daniels 70th</text>
  <text start="463.69" dur="6.99">week tipa vided verse 26 at first 27</text>
  <text start="466.71" dur="7.48">okay so without further ado let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.68" dur="6.07">go ahead and try to go through this</text>
  <text start="474.19" dur="5.28">timeline</text>
  <text start="476.75" dur="6.06">the revised timeline so this is from</text>
  <text start="479.47" dur="6.82">what I originally created back in 2013</text>
  <text start="482.81" dur="6.12">but now I&amp;#39;ve updated it alright the</text>
  <text start="486.29" dur="5.07">riddle of King Cyrus Daniel 70 week 17</text>

  <text start="510.65" dur="4.47">just found and this is stuff I did last</text>
  <text start="513.409" dur="3.831">night today I just found evidence that</text>
  <text start="515.12" dur="6.15">he began his reign two years earlier and</text>
  <text start="517.24" dur="6.75">561 bc no scholars dispute that Cyrus</text>

  <text start="523.99" dur="5.05">accepted universally no scholars dispute</text>
  <text start="527.33" dur="4.35">that Darius the first begin is ruling</text>
  <text start="529.04" dur="4.95">522 bc however i just found evidence</text>
  <text start="531.68" dur="4.08">last night today that Darius the first</text>
  <text start="533.99" dur="4.59">may have actually begun two years</text>
  <text start="535.76" dur="5.19">earlier in five 24pc due to the Persian</text>
  <text start="538.58" dur="4.29">army disappearing in five 24pc at giving</text>
  <text start="540.95" dur="3.15">Darius a powerful incentive to move in</text>
  <text start="542.87" dur="3.87">and take power for himself and I&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="544.1" dur="4.08">about that a little later no scholars</text>
  <text start="546.74" dur="3.42">dispute that excerpt sees the first</text>
  <text start="548.18" dur="3.93">began his rule in 46 BC however</text>
  <text start="550.16" dur="4.83">according to evidence I found it is now</text>
  <text start="552.11" dur="5.25">likely begin as Roland 490 BC to make</text>

  <text start="557.36" dur="4.22">his son art exertions the first began</text>
  <text start="559.58" dur="4.2">his reign due to new evidence I found</text>
  <text start="561.58" dur="4.18">scholars found Nebuchadnezzar ruled for</text>
  <text start="563.78" dur="3.21">43 years and died in the 44th year of</text>
  <text start="565.76" dur="3.72">his reign they just have him in the</text>
  <text start="566.99" dur="5.659">wrong 43 years and then I cite all these</text>
  <text start="569.48" dur="5.99">struggle sources for this information</text>
  <text start="572.649" dur="5.711">now here&amp;#39;s what I did last night today</text>
  <text start="575.47" dur="5.17">to correct the timeline and try to shift</text>
  <text start="578.36" dur="5.9">it back a few years so that that 69</text>
  <text start="580.64" dur="7.02">weeks ends in 1380 rather than 1782</text>
  <text start="584.26" dur="6.1">harmonize with Daniel 9 first of all I</text>
  <text start="587.66" dur="4.17">wanted to re-verify Darius the second</text>
  <text start="590.36" dur="3.39">train now dairies the second is the</text>
  <text start="591.83" dur="4.74">character mentioned in has revived and</text>
  <text start="593.75" dur="4.56">Ezra six as are six is where the temple</text>
  <text start="596.57" dur="3.63">is finally finished it&amp;#39;s been built for</text>
  <text start="598.31" dur="3.87">years and it&amp;#39;s finally finished under</text>
  <text start="600.2" dur="3.81">Darius the second that&amp;#39;s the Darius</text>
  <text start="602.18" dur="5.34">mention in Ezra 60 he&amp;#39;s a very important</text>

  <text start="825.68" dur="7.349">darius one sent his persian army to try</text>

  <text start="842.149" dur="5.13">mentally lost i got a little less than</text>
  <text start="844.339" dur="5.161">200 men so as a humiliating defeat and</text>
  <text start="847.279" dur="4.321">what i suspect is in that battle of</text>
  <text start="849.5" dur="5.37">marathon because Darius one has such a</text>
  <text start="851.6" dur="5.549">humiliating defeat that perhaps at that</text>
  <text start="854.87" dur="3.99">point exerts he&amp;#39;s the first who took on</text>
  <text start="857.149" dur="4.321">the title his grandfather Cyrus the</text>

  <text start="861.47" dur="9.8">and and take over in for 90 which again</text>
  <text start="865.88" dur="7.22">this would kind of be Darius the first</text>
  <text start="871.27" dur="3.21">basically reading what he had sown and</text>
  <text start="873.1" dur="3.159">we&amp;#39;re going to read about that just a</text>
  <text start="874.48" dur="3.789">moment</text>
  <text start="876.259" dur="2.97">okay the remainder of the timeline can</text>
  <text start="878.269" dur="4.29">be adjusted by beginning</text>
  <text start="879.229" dur="5.85">Nebuchadnezzar&amp;#39;s rain in 577 bc rather</text>
  <text start="882.559" dur="5.46">than 575 because again we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="885.079" dur="4.56">again we know he reigned for 43 years</text>
  <text start="888.019" dur="4.05">and died in his 44th year we just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="889.639" dur="5.16">know when those years were if we place</text>
  <text start="892.069" dur="5.06">this rain starting in 577 bc than the 69</text>
  <text start="894.799" dur="4.65">weeks of Daniel finishes out 13 ad</text>
  <text start="897.129" dur="5.26">another problem happens if we shift</text>
  <text start="899.449" dur="5.58">things back to certain 577 bc rather</text>

  <text start="907.729" dur="4.26">561 as the timeline would now dictate</text>
  <text start="910.009" dur="3.66">however it looks like Cyrus the Great</text>
  <text start="911.989" dur="4.1">might have indeed begun at his random</text>
  <text start="913.669" dur="4.89">561 you see because of what I found here</text>
  <text start="916.089" dur="5.23">wikipedia says Cyrus&amp;#39;s reign ended in</text>
  <text start="918.559" dur="6.24">December 5 30 BC and his reign was</text>
  <text start="921.319" dur="5.16">between 29 to 31 years long so that</text>
  <text start="924.799" dur="4.5">would mean his reign could have begun in</text>
  <text start="926.479" dur="7.05">561 bc so there we have proof that it</text>
  <text start="929.299" dur="6.54">very likely didn&amp;#39;t begin a 531 one last</text>
  <text start="933.529" dur="5.58">problem arises Darius the first is</text>
  <text start="935.839" dur="4.83">supposed to be gun is rain in 522 bc but</text>
  <text start="939.109" dur="4.741">in my revised timeline this would be</text>
  <text start="940.669" dur="5.25">shifted back to 524 bc all historical</text>
  <text start="943.85" dur="4.979">documents record canvasses the second</text>
  <text start="945.919" dur="4.92">dying in 522 bc and darius 1 beginning</text>
  <text start="948.829" dur="4.29">in fact i am too busy however i would</text>
  <text start="950.839" dur="5.61">like to put forth an alternative if you</text>
  <text start="953.119" dur="5.58">google cam aziz 2 and 5 24 bc you will</text>
  <text start="956.449" dur="5.34">find a host of articles about how his</text>

  <text start="961.789" dur="4.23">bc in the deserts of Egypt is it</text>
  <text start="964.189" dur="4.68">possible due to this overwhelming loss</text>
  <text start="966.019" dur="4.5">of 50,000 Persian troops but Darius the</text>

  <text start="1247.2" dur="5.22">earlier well the reason I believe this</text>
  <text start="1250.2" dur="4.8">is true is because think about it the</text>
  <text start="1252.42" dur="4.74">70-year exile began not when people</text>
  <text start="1255" dur="4.77">first started leaving Jerusalem because</text>
  <text start="1257.16" dur="3.93">Daniel was taken as a captive several</text>
  <text start="1259.77" dur="3.13">years before the temples burned to the</text>
  <text start="1261.09" dur="5.2">ground as we showed the timeline</text>
  <text start="1262.9" dur="5.67">but the 70-year exile began when the</text>
  <text start="1266.29" dur="4.17">temple was burned to the ground so would</text>
  <text start="1268.57" dur="4.47">it not make sense that the 70 years end</text>
  <text start="1270.46" dur="4.83">when the foundation of a new temple is</text>
  <text start="1273.04" dur="5.76">late and so that&amp;#39;s why I think that this</text>
  <text start="1275.29" dur="5.79">is true so the temple construction</text>
  <text start="1278.8" dur="4.35">begins foundations laid then and Ezra</text>
