  <text start="71.25" dur="5.61">yom kippur the prophetic implications of</text>
  <text start="73.35" dur="4.83">Yom Kippur but this year I&amp;#39;m going to do</text>
  <text start="76.86" dur="4.74">something a little different just</text>
  <text start="78.18" dur="6.56">because I feel yas ruach leading me in a</text>
  <text start="81.6" dur="5.55">different direction for Yom Kippur and</text>
  <text start="84.74" dur="4.239">when you go to Leviticus 23 which</text>
  <text start="87.15" dur="4.14">details all the different Sabbath and</text>
  <text start="88.979" dur="4.311">high Sabbath days starting with the</text>
  <text start="91.29" dur="4.649">weekly Sabbath and then going through</text>
  <text start="93.29" dur="5.86">the various feast days of Passover</text>
  <text start="95.939" dur="4.951">unleavened bread firstfruits shavuot yom</text>
  <text start="99.15" dur="4.259">teruah or the Feast of Trumpets which we</text>
  <text start="100.89" dur="7.14">celebrated 10 days ago to begin the fall</text>
  <text start="103.409" dur="9.301">feasts and now tonight today we start</text>
  <text start="108.03" dur="7.019">yom kippur what is interesting is Yom</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="4.35">Kippur is the only fee stay out of all</text>
  <text start="115.049" dur="4.621">these Sabbath&amp;#39;s that are talked about in</text>
  <text start="117.06" dur="4.68">Leviticus 23 it&amp;#39;s the only Sabbath that</text>
  <text start="119.67" dur="5.129">basically says that if you don&amp;#39;t observe</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="7.019">the Sabbath Yahweh is going to destroy</text>
  <text start="124.799" dur="6.69">your soul from among his people</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="4.171">now of course it&amp;#39;s still very important</text>
  <text start="131.489" dur="4.47">to keep the other sabes that are</text>
  <text start="132.93" dur="4.5">detailed in Leviticus 23 but Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="135.959" dur="3.87">is the only one that has this very</text>
  <text start="137.43" dur="4.949">strict penalty that if you don&amp;#39;t observe</text>
  <text start="139.829" dur="4.711">this day and cease from doing work and</text>
  <text start="142.379" dur="3.991">afflict your soul by not eating food not</text>
  <text start="144.54" dur="5.1">drinking water then Yahweh&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="146.37" dur="7.05">destroy your soul for longest people</text>
  <text start="149.64" dur="5.879">that&amp;#39;s what he said so obviously it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.42" dur="5.039">very important that we celebrate yom</text>
  <text start="155.519" dur="5.161">kippur on the correct day because if we</text>
  <text start="158.459" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t yahweh says if you don&amp;#39;t keep yom</text>
  <text start="160.68" dur="5.339">kippur on the right day he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="163.319" dur="4.56">destroy your soul from among his people</text>
  <text start="166.019" dur="3.511">so we need to make sure that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="167.879" dur="3.871">keeping this tenth day of the seventh</text>
  <text start="169.53" dur="5.039">month on the correct day which of course</text>
  <text start="171.75" dur="4.799">falls on a different calendar day every</text>
  <text start="174.569" dur="5.521">year either in september-october</text>
  <text start="176.549" dur="6">depending on the year last year it was</text>
  <text start="180.09" dur="3.869">on October fourth the evening of October</text>
  <text start="182.549" dur="3.211">third of the evening of October for that</text>
  <text start="183.959" dur="4.911">actually thought that Sabbath last year</text>
  <text start="185.76" dur="5.849">this year it falls on a on a Wednesday</text>
  <text start="188.87" dur="5.799">so every year it&amp;#39;s different so I</text>
  <text start="191.609" dur="5.731">thought it would be very good to the</text>
  <text start="194.669" dur="6.93">duaa teaching for Yom Kippur about the</text>
  <text start="197.34" dur="6.03">scriptural calendar now I&amp;#39;ve been on</text>
  <text start="201.599" dur="5.25">facebook and I&amp;#39;ve been getting messages</text>
  <text start="203.37" dur="6.209">through my website YouTube and this</text>
  <text start="206.849" dur="4.741">calendar shoes really keeps coming up</text>
  <text start="209.579" dur="5.791">over and over again I had a debate with</text>
  <text start="211.59" dur="6.84">someone the summer back in July about</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="5.13">what what a new moon actually is and it</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="4.41">just seems like this whole calendar</text>
  <text start="220.5" dur="7.109">debate continues to come up over and</text>
  <text start="222.84" dur="6.09">over again as a very important issue now</text>
  <text start="227.609" dur="3.09">first of all when I make it clear there</text>
  <text start="228.93" dur="4.47">should not be any confusion over what</text>
  <text start="230.699" dur="4.561">the correct calendar is okay just like</text>
  <text start="233.4" dur="4.41">Yahweh makes it very clear what day</text>
  <text start="235.26" dur="4.71">Shabbat is on which coincides with our</text>
  <text start="237.81" dur="4.17">pagan calendar of Friday sundown to</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="4.549">Saturday sundown this is he makes it</text>
  <text start="241.98" dur="5.28">clear you know how to wear the zeit zeit</text>
  <text start="244.519" dur="4.84">how to eat clean foods and to avoid</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="3.75">unclean foods he makes all of his</text>
  <text start="249.359" dur="2.94">Commandments very clear and the calendar</text>
  <text start="251.01" dur="3.719">is no different the calendar is clear</text>
  <text start="252.299" dur="4.68">I&amp;#39;ve heard respected teachers in the</text>
  <text start="254.729" dur="4.591">Messianic Andy roots movement say things</text>
  <text start="256.979" dur="4.081">like well because the calendar issues so</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="2.25">ambiguous and sorry to figure out which</text>
  <text start="261.06" dur="1.68">is the right</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="2.4">Cal endurance there&amp;#39;s so many different</text>
  <text start="262.74" dur="3.54">calendars out there and everyone has</text>
  <text start="263.97" dur="3.45">their arguments for it you know really</text>
  <text start="266.28" dur="3.6">this is something that we just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="267.42" dur="5.49">figure out and I strongly disagree with</text>
  <text start="269.88" dur="5.19">that we can know the true scriptural</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="4.71">calendar Yahweh makes it very clear in</text>
  <text start="275.07" dur="4.47">his scriptures we can know when the new</text>
  <text start="277.62" dur="3.75">year begins scripturally we can know</text>
  <text start="279.54" dur="4.29">when these feasts dates occur and we can</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="5.49">know when yom kippur happens every year</text>
  <text start="283.83" dur="4.41">for sure so that we make sure we observe</text>
  <text start="286.86" dur="4.85">it as Yahweh says so that he does not</text>
  <text start="288.24" dur="7.07">destroy our soul from among the people</text>
  <text start="291.71" dur="7.21">so I&amp;#39;m going to do a short teaching on</text>
  <text start="295.31" dur="7.18">how to follow the correct scriptural</text>
  <text start="298.92" dur="5.76">calendar you may have heard that the</text>
  <text start="302.49" dur="5.37">Jews many of the Messianic says well</text>
  <text start="304.68" dur="5.22">keep the hallel to calendar which is the</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="4.35">calculated calendar denon by a rabbi</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="3.96">named Hallel the second who lived</text>
  <text start="312.21" dur="4.59">hundreds of years ago in the fourth</text>
  <text start="313.86" dur="4.77">century he created this mathematical</text>
  <text start="316.8" dur="4.02">formula to figure out when the feast</text>
  <text start="318.63" dur="4.8">days should be because the Jews were in</text>
  <text start="320.82" dur="4.17">exile that of course is not the</text>
  <text start="323.43" dur="5.64">scriptural calendar it&amp;#39;s a mathematical</text>
  <text start="324.99" dur="6.24">formula that a man invented you may have</text>
  <text start="329.07" dur="3.99">heard of the care right calendar or the</text>
  <text start="331.23" dur="4.95">calendar that macaroon promotes where</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="5.16">they go by the barley as soon as they</text>
  <text start="336.18" dur="4.08">find a vivre barley or ripen barley</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="5.25">anywhere Land of Israel then the next</text>
  <text start="340.26" dur="5.4">new moon is the new year well that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="343.47" dur="3.84">the correct calendar either because</text>
  <text start="345.66" dur="3.6">nowhere in scripture does it say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="347.31" dur="3.99">only to use the barley as an indicator</text>
  <text start="349.26" dur="4.56">for the new year that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="351.3" dur="6.96">it&amp;#39;s a indicator but it&amp;#39;s not the only</text>
  <text start="353.82" dur="6.89">indicator you may have heard of this</text>
  <text start="358.26" dur="4.68">Enochian calendar that goes by a solar</text>
  <text start="360.71" dur="3.97">calendar where they think the day starts</text>
  <text start="362.94" dur="4.11">at the day time which is ridiculous</text>
  <text start="364.68" dur="5.43">because we even read Leviticus 23 about</text>
  <text start="367.05" dur="5.1">Yom Kippur itself Yahweh says keep this</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="3.36">from the ninth date evening until the</text>
  <text start="372.15" dur="3.63">tenth day t weeks showing that a day</text>
  <text start="373.47" dur="4.68">starts at night at the evening at</text>
  <text start="375.78" dur="3.66">sundown just as reading Genesis there</text>
  <text start="378.15" dur="2.85">was evening and there was morning the</text>
  <text start="379.44" dur="3.72">first day there was evening and there</text>
  <text start="381" dur="3.87">was morning the second day all these</text>
  <text start="383.16" dur="3.51">challengers are wrong for various</text>
  <text start="384.87" dur="3.72">reasons but there is one calendar that</text>
  <text start="386.67" dur="4.44">is correct it is scriptural and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="388.59" dur="4.16">what I&amp;#39;m going to teach tonight on this</text>
  <text start="391.11" dur="5">day of Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="6.36">if you go to Genesis chapter one and you</text>
  <text start="396.11" dur="4.47">go to verse 14 so Yahweh in the very</text>
  <text start="399.11" dur="4.26">first chapter wants to make sure we know</text>
  <text start="400.58" dur="4.23">how to keep the current calendar and you</text>
  <text start="403.37" dur="2.94">always said let there be lights in the</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="3.6">firmament of the heaven to divide the</text>
  <text start="406.31" dur="4.17">day from the night and let them be for</text>
  <text start="408.41" dur="5.04">signs and for seasons and four days and</text>
  <text start="410.48" dur="5.25">years and what are these lights that he</text>
  <text start="413.45" dur="5.33">makes he makes the Sun he makes the</text>
  <text start="415.73" dur="5.07">scent moon and he makes the stars and</text>
  <text start="418.78" dur="3.58">these are what we&amp;#39;re supposed to use for</text>
  <text start="420.8" dur="6.119">signs four seasons four days and four</text>
  <text start="422.36" dur="6.54">years so right here we always told us I</text>
  <text start="426.919" dur="3.541">want you to use the Sun the moon and the</text>
  <text start="428.9" dur="2.94">stars i want you need to use these</text>
  <text start="430.46" dur="3.57">lights that I&amp;#39;m creating on the fourth</text>
  <text start="431.84" dur="5.55">day of creation to determine when a year</text>
  <text start="434.03" dur="6.63">begins when the correct seasons are when</text>
  <text start="437.39" dur="4.92">to keep these annual feast days so how</text>
  <text start="440.66" dur="6.36">do we use the Sun the moon and the stars</text>
  <text start="442.31" dur="6.18">well let&amp;#39;s start with the Sun how do we</text>
  <text start="447.02" dur="4.5">use the Sun to determine the new year</text>
  <text start="448.49" dur="4.56">see the care rights and halal to and the</text>
  <text start="451.52" dur="4.53">enochians and all these other calendars</text>
  <text start="453.05" dur="6.57">out there they don&amp;#39;t use the Sun we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.05" dur="7.26">going to use the Sun how to use the Sun</text>
  <text start="459.62" dur="6.09">to determine the new year the only way</text>
  <text start="463.31" dur="4.859">to use the Sun is to go by the spring</text>
  <text start="465.71" dur="4.47">equinox there&amp;#39;s actually Hebrew word</text>
  <text start="468.169" dur="4.051">that means turning of the year it&amp;#39;s tiff</text>
  <text start="470.18" dur="4.65">hookah it&amp;#39;s used in the scriptures to</text>
  <text start="472.22" dur="5.19">describe both the autumn equinox and the</text>
  <text start="474.83" dur="4.29">spring equinox so the only way we can</text>
  <text start="477.41" dur="4.74">use the Sun to determine the new year is</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="7.5">the spring equinox and the equinox is</text>
  <text start="482.15" dur="6.74">very well known to many people we know</text>
  <text start="486.62" dur="4.83">that the month begins on the new moon</text>
  <text start="488.89" dur="5.32">now what is a new moon the new moon is</text>
  <text start="491.45" dur="4.65">not a crescent okay there is a word saw</text>
  <text start="494.21" dur="4.56">her own for Crescent it actually</text>
  <text start="496.1" dur="4.92">describes a moon crescent or jewelry in</text>
  <text start="498.77" dur="4.56">the shape of a moon crescent it&amp;#39;s used</text>
  <text start="501.02" dur="4.26">in the Book of Jeremiah or Isaiah one of</text>
  <text start="503.33" dur="5.31">those two books but it is never once</text>
  <text start="505.28" dur="5.07">used for new moon never once do you see</text>
  <text start="508.64" dur="3.33">anyone going outside and spotting the</text>
  <text start="510.35" dur="3.66">first Crescent to declare new moon</text>
  <text start="511.97" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s not in Scripture it&amp;#39;s in town mud</text>
  <text start="514.01" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s in Babylonian Talmud it is not in</text>
  <text start="516.62" dur="2.96">Scripture so the Crescent is not the new</text>
  <text start="518.93" dur="2.66">moon</text>
  <text start="519.58" dur="4.14">new moon is at conjunction with the Sun</text>
  <text start="521.59" dur="3.87">the earth and the moon are in perfect</text>
  <text start="523.72" dur="4.86">alignment happens only once a month</text>
  <text start="525.46" dur="6.63">every 29 or 30 days and the moment that</text>
  <text start="528.58" dur="5.37">that conjunction happens whatever time</text>
  <text start="532.09" dur="3.87">it is an Israel the following sunset</text>
  <text start="533.95" dur="3.6">that next sunset is the day of the new</text>
  <text start="535.96" dur="4.29">moon because a day of course will only</text>
  <text start="537.55" dur="4.74">begin at night so you&amp;#39;re using the Sun</text>
  <text start="540.25" dur="4.32">and you&amp;#39;re using the moon you start on</text>
  <text start="542.29" dur="4.89">the first new moon on or after the</text>
  <text start="544.57" dur="4.2">spring of guns not the first no moon</text>
  <text start="547.18" dur="3.48">nearest the spring equinox because if</text>
  <text start="548.77" dur="3.63">you started on the new moon just before</text>
  <text start="550.66" dur="3.75">the equinox you&amp;#39;re starting a new year</text>
  <text start="552.4" dur="4.53">in an old year when the winter hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="554.41" dur="4.26">finished yet so it&amp;#39;s the first new moon</text>
  <text start="556.93" dur="5.61">after this for you connection here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="558.67" dur="5.22">deal with the barley if you wait for the</text>
  <text start="562.54" dur="5.46">first new moon after the spring equinox</text>
  <text start="563.89" dur="6.03">every single year no matter what the</text>
  <text start="568" dur="6.32">barley will always be fully Aviv in</text>
  <text start="569.92" dur="7.05">Israel always without fail no question</text>
  <text start="574.32" dur="5.71">when you wait for the first new moon at</text>
  <text start="576.97" dur="5.22">conjunction after the spring of canucks</text>
  <text start="580.03" dur="3.9">the barley from the southern all the way</text>
  <text start="582.19" dur="3.09">to the northern parts of Israel but</text>
  <text start="583.93" dur="4.65">maybe the exception of some mountain</text>
  <text start="585.28" dur="5.67">areas will be of Eve now why is that</text>
  <text start="588.58" dur="7.89">important because if you go to Leviticus</text>
  <text start="590.95" dur="7.17">chapter 23 and verse 10 wait so speak</text>
  <text start="596.47" dur="3.9">under the children of Israel and say to</text>
  <text start="598.12" dur="3.54">them when you come into the land which I</text>

  <text start="659.17" dur="5.94">the barley was right when this plague of</text>
  <text start="661.209" dur="6.93">hail hit so we but here&amp;#39;s the deal the</text>

  <text start="668.139" dur="3.45">second pass rubber was in the wilderness</text>
  <text start="669.37" dur="3.54">and then subsequent past summers of</text>
  <text start="671.589" dur="3.841">course we&amp;#39;re in the land of israel now</text>
  <text start="672.91" dur="4.32">barley ripen six to eight weeks earlier</text>
  <text start="675.43" dur="5.219">in Egypt than it does in Israel because</text>
  <text start="677.23" dur="5.94">Egypt tends to be warmer drier not as</text>
  <text start="680.649" dur="5.101">much rain as Israel gets and so barley</text>
  <text start="683.17" dur="5.399">comes into season earlier in the year so</text>
  <text start="685.75" dur="6.029">in order to avoid having Passover two</text>
  <text start="688.569" dur="5.431">different times in Egypt and in Israel</text>
  <text start="691.779" dur="4.23">you wait for that first new moon after</text>
  <text start="694" dur="4.55">the spring equinox when the barley will</text>
  <text start="696.009" dur="5.551">be Aviv throughout all the Middle East</text>
  <text start="698.55" dur="4.899">Egypt and Israel by the way Egypt will</text>

  <text start="705.67" dur="4.44">River to the Euphrates so this</text>
  <text start="707.889" dur="6.031">reconciles that so really Bart barley</text>
  <text start="710.11" dur="5.37">becomes unintended a tur the main two</text>
  <text start="713.92" dur="3.75">indicator is to wait for that first no</text>
  <text start="715.48" dur="5.729">moon after the spring equinox in order</text>
  <text start="717.67" dur="5.82">to follow Genesis 114 and this ensures</text>
  <text start="721.209" dur="5.101">that your feast days will always be in</text>
  <text start="723.49" dur="4.649">the correct season so what happens like</text>
  <text start="726.31" dur="4.94">what happened in 2013 if you try to</text>
  <text start="728.139" dur="8.041">start the new moon before the equinox</text>
  <text start="731.25" dur="7.3">you wind up having Sukkot in early</text>
  <text start="736.18" dur="4.92">September before any of the fruits of</text>
  <text start="738.55" dur="7.019">men harvested or brought in in Israel</text>

  <text start="750.459" dur="3.721">the only way to keep the feasts in the</text>
  <text start="752.709" dur="3.3">right season and so because of this</text>
  <text start="754.18" dur="4.889">sometimes you do have to add a 13th</text>
  <text start="756.009" dur="5.911">month depending on when that twelfth new</text>
  <text start="759.069" dur="5.611">moon occurs every year there was needed</text>
