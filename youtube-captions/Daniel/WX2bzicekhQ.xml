  <text start="230.69" dur="5.22">were added later chronologically as you</text>
  <text start="234.2" dur="5.369">go throughout the year the next one</text>
  <text start="235.91" dur="6.389">would be Hanukkah that was that during</text>
  <text start="239.569" dur="4.471">the time of the Maccabees that you can</text>
  <text start="242.299" dur="3.871">read about in the historical books first</text>
  <text start="244.04" dur="4.559">and second Maccabees Hanukkah of course</text>
  <text start="246.17" dur="4.59">was even celebrated by Jesus if you go</text>
  <text start="248.599" dur="4.441">to the Gospel of John John chapter 10</text>
  <text start="250.76" dur="4.74">verse 22 that&amp;#39;s about dedicating</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="5.97">rededicating yourself to yah and and</text>
  <text start="255.5" dur="5.12">deliverance and then and then in and</text>

  <text start="260.62" dur="5.2">December to January depending on the</text>
  <text start="262.91" dur="5.24">year and then after Monica you have</text>
  <text start="265.82" dur="5.569">Purim so I&amp;#39;m running out of space here</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="5.62">Purim which was the book of Esther and</text>
  <text start="271.389" dur="4.421">that story of Esther has also struck</text>
  <text start="273.77" dur="4.25">deliverance in that depending on the</text>
  <text start="275.81" dur="6.15">Year happens usually anywhere from</text>
  <text start="278.02" dur="6.03">February to March okay so I&amp;#39;m not really</text>
  <text start="281.96" dur="5.82">going to talk about Hanukkah and Purim</text>
  <text start="284.05" dur="7.48">I&amp;#39;m going to be centering on these these</text>
  <text start="287.78" dur="6.54">seven feasts that are talked about in in</text>
  <text start="291.53" dur="4.83">the scriptures and more importantly I</text>
  <text start="294.32" dur="4.71">want to talk about something the new</text>
  <text start="296.36" dur="4.35">Yashiro showed me while we were in</text>
  <text start="299.03" dur="6.509">prayer group last night about these</text>
  <text start="300.71" dur="8.16">feasts not really new per se but just</text>
  <text start="305.539" dur="5.011">maybe a reminder and this may be just a</text>
  <text start="308.87" dur="6.24">reminder and refresher for all of you as</text>
  <text start="310.55" dur="6.8">well so first Passover which is about</text>
  <text start="315.11" dur="4.67">the blood of the Lamb it&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="317.35" dur="4.77">Joshua was crucified on the day of</text>
  <text start="319.78" dur="4.5">Passover he was buried for three days</text>
  <text start="322.12" dur="3.96">and three nights during that first part</text>
  <text start="324.28" dur="3.66">of unleavened bread and then he</text>
  <text start="326.08" dur="2.73">resurrected in roses the first fruits</text>
  <text start="327.94" dur="6.92">from among the dead</text>
  <text start="328.81" dur="11.31">okay so Passover is all about salvation</text>
  <text start="334.86" dur="7.54">right salvation and what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="340.12" dur="4.35">about this piece it&amp;#39;s the only feast of</text>
  <text start="342.4" dur="4.35">all the feasts that are listed it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="344.47" dur="5.13">only one that if you miss it</text>
  <text start="346.75" dur="5.4">yah allows a provision where you can</text>
  <text start="349.6" dur="5.55">keep it a month later so if when</text>
  <text start="352.15" dur="5.22">Passover first occurs you know in April</text>
  <text start="355.15" dur="3.99">and you&amp;#39;re you know you have to go to a</text>
  <text start="357.37" dur="4.05">funeral or you&amp;#39;re traveling or whatever</text>
  <text start="359.14" dur="5.7">you could actually keep it a month later</text>
  <text start="361.42" dur="4.68">in the second month in May if you miss</text>
  <text start="364.84" dur="2.97">it the first time and the reason for</text>
  <text start="366.1" dur="3.06">that is because Passover which is all</text>
  <text start="367.81" dur="4.26">about the blood of the Covenant the</text>
  <text start="369.16" dur="4.65">blood of Christ without that you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="372.07" dur="3.66">get to the other feasts right you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="373.81" dur="3">move on you have to have salvation in</text>
  <text start="375.73" dur="2.82">maasai you have to have his blood</text>
  <text start="376.81" dur="2.97">atonement best the foundation for</text>
  <text start="378.55" dur="3.96">everything and that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="379.78" dur="5.25">piece that yah specifically says in his</text>
  <text start="382.51" dur="4.35">Torah that if you miss it hey there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="385.03" dur="3">second chance that you can you can still</text>
  <text start="386.86" dur="2.28">celebrate it so I think that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="388.03" dur="4.05">intersting it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="389.14" dur="5.79">highlighting what the basis of salvation</text>
  <text start="392.08" dur="5.64">is the blood atonement of Messiah of</text>
  <text start="394.93" dur="6.3">Jesus Yahshua so salvation is wrapped up</text>
  <text start="397.72" dur="8.81">in this first one here then shadow or</text>
  <text start="401.23" dur="5.3">Pentecost this is sanctification</text>
  <text start="407.45" dur="3.11">[Music]</text>
  <text start="411.43" dur="5.949">sanctification this is about the Holy</text>

  <text start="417.379" dur="4.891">shaping us molding us more into his</text>

  <text start="422.27" dur="3.449">dwelling within us so that we can obey</text>

  <text start="437.21" dur="3.78">that he can he can remove the rough</text>
  <text start="439.129" dur="5.85">edges he can sanctifies it&amp;#39;s an ongoing</text>
  <text start="440.99" dur="6.03">process where he continues to shape us</text>
  <text start="444.979" dur="4.321">and mold us more into his image so that</text>
  <text start="447.02" dur="4.32">eventually when we stand before him on</text>
  <text start="449.3" dur="3.45">that gray day he could say well done my</text>
  <text start="451.34" dur="3.06">good and faithful servant so this Holy</text>
  <text start="452.75" dur="4.259">Spirit is really important in terms of</text>
  <text start="454.4" dur="6.09">sanctification bringing us more in line</text>

  <text start="470.479" dur="4.351">important it&amp;#39;s interesting because the</text>
  <text start="472.34" dur="4.37">Holy Spirit was given on shadow to those</text>
  <text start="474.83" dur="3.509">early disciples in the upper room and</text>
  <text start="476.71" dur="4">thousands of years earlier</text>
  <text start="478.339" dur="3.961">the Torah was given on Mount Sinai so</text>
  <text start="480.71" dur="3.389">the word of the Spirit</text>
  <text start="482.3" dur="3.839">you know the Torah and the spirit it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="489.83" dur="2.25">sanctification that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="491.33" dur="3.48">through right now</text>
  <text start="492.08" dur="5.459">if we&amp;#39;ve if we&amp;#39;ve repented of our sins</text>

  <text start="506.96" dur="3.69">repented of our sins and you know given</text>
  <text start="508.849" dur="3.87">our hearts to him we had that salvation</text>

  <text start="703.77" dur="3.66">happen to believe that it will happen in</text>
  <text start="705.42" dur="3.99">the days of the seventh trumpet as it</text>
  <text start="707.43" dur="4.02">talks about in revelation 10 and 11 and</text>
  <text start="709.41" dur="4.32">those days of the seventh trumpet are</text>
  <text start="711.45" dur="4.35">always those days between yom teruah and</text>
  <text start="713.73" dur="3.81">then every year 10-day liturgy of yom</text>

  <text start="748.86" dur="4.71">standing on that sea of fire and glass</text>
  <text start="751.2" dur="5.31">in heaven as it&amp;#39;s talked about in</text>
  <text start="753.57" dur="5.34">Revelation and this Paul talks about</text>
  <text start="756.51" dur="4.56">this how you know we&amp;#39;re standing before</text>
  <text start="758.91" dur="4.68">the judgment seat of Christ and he gives</text>
  <text start="761.07" dur="6.87">us our rewards based on what we did on</text>
  <text start="763.59" dur="6.54">earth and you know some of us will have</text>
  <text start="767.94" dur="4.59">you know gold and jewels and you know</text>
  <text start="770.13" dur="4.86">depending on what we did what we did</text>
  <text start="772.53" dur="4.68">what how we responded and how we live</text>
  <text start="774.99" dur="4.95">and what kind of good works that he</text>
  <text start="777.21" dur="4.44">worked through us by His Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="779.94" dur="4.59">through his blood how he helped that</text>
  <text start="781.65" dur="4.59">then he&amp;#39;ll reward us for the things we</text>
  <text start="784.53" dur="3.3">did and it says some some will just</text>
  <text start="786.24" dur="3.27">escape as if going through a fire it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="787.83" dur="3">all be burned up like hey wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="789.51" dur="5.31">stubble but they&amp;#39;ll have that foundation</text>
  <text start="790.83" dur="5.85">of Christ so so that&amp;#39;s our rewards is</text>
  <text start="794.82" dur="4.17">the Day of Atonement Yom Kippur we stand</text>
  <text start="796.68" dur="5.159">on that sea of fire and glass and he</text>
  <text start="798.99" dur="5.13">gives us our rewards based on you know</text>
  <text start="801.839" dur="3.611">what we did what we allowed him to do</text>
  <text start="804.12" dur="3.76">through us</text>
  <text start="805.45" dur="5.34">on earth and even you know when he</text>
  <text start="807.88" dur="4.649">rewards us it&amp;#39;s kind of like why should</text>
  <text start="810.79" dur="3.72">we get rewarded because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s him</text>
  <text start="812.529" dur="4.201">right I mean even when we do good works</text>
  <text start="814.51" dur="4.259">we can&amp;#39;t take credit for it because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="816.73" dur="3.96">his holy spirit it&amp;#39;s him working through</text>
  <text start="818.769" dur="3.601">us allowing us to do this stuff without</text>
  <text start="820.69" dur="4.29">him we&amp;#39;d be you know we wouldn&amp;#39;t bill to</text>
  <text start="822.37" dur="5.73">do any of that so still he gets all the</text>
  <text start="824.98" dur="5.07">glory and all the credit so the rewards</text>
  <text start="828.1" dur="2.85">is young is Yom Kippur and then you</text>
  <text start="830.05" dur="3.029">match the coat</text>
  <text start="830.95" dur="5.1">this is sort of a grand jewel of all the</text>
  <text start="833.079" dur="4.741">feasts it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s an eight days or</text>
  <text start="836.05" dur="3.63">seven days you&amp;#39;re in a Sukkah or what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="837.82" dur="3.24">known as a tent or temporary dwelling</text>
  <text start="839.68" dur="3.42">structure and then on the eighth day is</text>
  <text start="841.06" dur="4.86">the last great day where you come out</text>
  <text start="843.1" dur="5.82">and this is all about the new heavens of</text>
  <text start="845.92" dur="5.76">the new earth okay and it&amp;#39;s a wedding</text>
  <text start="848.92" dur="8.28">feast it&amp;#39;s eight days but this is the</text>
  <text start="851.68" dur="8.339">wedding this is the wedding and the</text>
  <text start="857.2" dur="5.579">wedding supper of the Lamb and you know</text>
  <text start="860.019" dur="3.81">the reason why Jesus said that in the</text>
  <text start="862.779" dur="2.881">resurrection after the resurrection</text>
  <text start="863.829" dur="4.831">there will be no more marriage or given</text>
  <text start="865.66" dur="5.039">and marriages because at that point we</text>
  <text start="868.66" dur="4.2">are gonna have such an intimacy with yah</text>
  <text start="870.699" dur="4.95">with the lamb with with Yahshua himself</text>
  <text start="872.86" dur="5.49">that we won&amp;#39;t even the thought of an</text>
  <text start="875.649" dur="3.81">earthly marriage will be sort of old you</text>
  <text start="878.35" dur="3.87">know like why would we want that because</text>
  <text start="879.459" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;ll have set the whole Paul talks</text>
  <text start="882.22" dur="4.619">about this the whole idea of marriage</text>
  <text start="884.949" dur="4.621">between a husband and a wife the</text>
  <text start="886.839" dur="4.771">intimacy that those two people share a</text>
  <text start="889.57" dur="5.37">husband and wife being one flesh that is</text>
  <text start="891.61" dur="5.669">just a small pale shadow for shattering</text>
  <text start="894.94" dur="6.99">what the intimacy will be like between</text>
  <text start="897.279" dur="6.691">his bride and himself in eternity and so</text>
  <text start="901.93" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s you know in you know mind cannot</text>
  <text start="903.97" dur="3.75">even comprehend what that intimacy is</text>
  <text start="905.62" dur="5.07">gonna be like so that&amp;#39;s all about the</text>
  <text start="907.72" dur="6.239">way and just you know the intimacy that</text>
  <text start="910.69" dur="4.589">goes for eternity so I just I just</text>
  <text start="913.959" dur="2.851">wanted to show this but letting it</text>
  <text start="915.279" dur="2.821">really does a good job these Hebrew</text>
  <text start="916.81" dur="2.519">feast days one of the reasons why I</text>
  <text start="918.1" dur="3.33">think it&amp;#39;s so important to be</text>
  <text start="919.329" dur="4.591">celebrating these Hebrew feast days why</text>
  <text start="921.43" dur="5.7">Paul himself talks about in Colossians</text>
  <text start="923.92" dur="5.88">that these feasts are a shadow of things</text>
  <text start="927.13" dur="5.67">to come even you know he wrote this</text>
  <text start="929.8" dur="4.39">letter to the Colossians assembly 3040</text>
  <text start="932.8" dur="3.55">years after the resurrection of</text>
  <text start="934.19" dur="4.35">right and he was still saying that these</text>
  <text start="936.35" dur="3.24">Hebrew feasts are a shadow of things to</text>
  <text start="938.54" dur="2.88">come so he&amp;#39;s still saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="939.59" dur="4.53">relevant to our lives and it just</text>
  <text start="941.42" dur="5.82">because it just so eloquently and</text>
  <text start="944.12" dur="5.94">amazingly describes this process that</text>
  <text start="947.24" dur="6.39">yah yah takes us through when we when we</text>
  <text start="950.06" dur="6.03">choose to to to heed his the conviction</text>
  <text start="953.63" dur="5.7">boy&amp;#39;s spirit repent and follow him you</text>
  <text start="956.09" dur="5.76">know when we choose to allow him to to</text>
  <text start="959.33" dur="4.59">love us and allow him to change our</text>
  <text start="961.85" dur="4.41">lives and to work with us then this is</text>
  <text start="963.92" dur="3.89">the beautiful process that he takes us</text>
  <text start="966.26" dur="5.22">through in our lives salvation</text>
  <text start="967.81" dur="7.72">sanctification ultimately glorification</text>
  <text start="971.48" dur="6.45">the rewards and then the way this is the</text>
  <text start="975.53" dur="4.83">process of Texas and so every year as we</text>
  <text start="977.93" dur="4.83">celebrate these feasts were just being</text>
  <text start="980.36" dur="6.12">reminded more and more about about this</text>
  <text start="982.76" dur="6.84">process this road he takes us on so I</text>
  <text start="986.48" dur="6.36">hope this was I hope this was eloquent</text>
  <text start="989.6" dur="5.76">and articulate enough that it blesses</text>
  <text start="992.84" dur="4.11">you you can read Leviticus 23 yourself</text>
  <text start="995.36" dur="3.09">sort of meditating pray over it and</text>
  <text start="996.95" dur="3.81">y&amp;#39;all will probably show you even more</text>
  <text start="998.45" dur="4.26">this is sort of just a basic cursory</text>
  <text start="1000.76" dur="4.59">overview of that but just wanted to show</text>
  <text start="1002.71" dur="5.16">again how these Hebrew feasts way back</text>
  <text start="1005.35" dur="4.2">in Leviticus 23 how they really stretch</text>
  <text start="1007.87" dur="4.02">out throughout the entire scriptures</text>
  <text start="1009.55" dur="4.38">from Genesis to Revelation and how they</text>
  <text start="1011.89" dur="4.4">they have utter relevance to our lives</text>
  <text start="1013.93" dur="4.71">as we spiritually grow in Christ</text>
  <text start="1016.29" dur="3.97">hallelujah all right shabbat shalom</text>
