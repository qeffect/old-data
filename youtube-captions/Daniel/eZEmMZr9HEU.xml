  <text start="11.3" dur="4.06">yom teruah the piece of trumpets and</text>
  <text start="13.67" dur="3.97">there&amp;#39;s something really really</text>
  <text start="15.36" dur="3.509">interesting related to the piece of</text>
  <text start="17.64" dur="3.42">trumpets and how all the feasts are</text>
  <text start="18.869" dur="3.931">connected that a bunch of us discovered</text>
  <text start="21.06" dur="4.41">yesterday when we were having a</text>
  <text start="22.8" dur="4.95">gathering for yom teruah and since we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="25.47" dur="4.26">so close now just a day after the piece</text>
  <text start="27.75" dur="4.469">of trumpets I wanted to present this</text>
  <text start="29.73" dur="5.7">while that piece is still fresh in our</text>
  <text start="32.219" dur="6.451">mind so I&amp;#39;m going to put the camera down</text>
  <text start="35.43" dur="6.719">here and I want to sort of visually show</text>
  <text start="38.67" dur="6.299">what I&amp;#39;m talking about when Yahshua rose</text>
  <text start="42.149" dur="4.68">from the grave during passover week he</text>
  <text start="44.969" dur="3.451">ascended up to the father as the first</text>
  <text start="46.829" dur="3.031">fruit of the barley harvest like</text>
  <text start="48.42" dur="4.5">presenting himself as the first fruit</text>
  <text start="49.86" dur="5.91">from the dead to the Father and so</text>
  <text start="52.92" dur="5.31">Yahshua you know he was up in heaven but</text>
  <text start="55.77" dur="5.699">then he came back down to earth to spend</text>
  <text start="58.23" dur="5.19">40 days with the disciples and he taught</text>
  <text start="61.469" dur="5.371">the disciples for those 40 days and then</text>
  <text start="63.42" dur="8.22">10 days before shallotte he ascended</text>
  <text start="66.84" dur="7.5">back up into heaven and why he said he</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="4.65">had to send up into heaven so that 10</text>
  <text start="74.34" dur="4.49">days later on Pentecost or shall vote</text>
  <text start="76.29" dur="5.899">the Holy Spirit the ruach ha kodesh</text>
  <text start="78.83" dur="6.09">could come back down the comforter and</text>
  <text start="82.189" dur="5.981">could teach the disciples and lead us</text>
  <text start="84.92" dur="4.72">but then shadow was fulfilled but then</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="3.6">the next feast of you fulfilled is yom</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="4.439">teruah or piece of trumpets and what</text>
  <text start="91.77" dur="4.11">happens on yom teruah all those who are</text>
  <text start="94.079" dur="4.5">filled with the ruach ha kodesh either</text>
  <text start="95.88" dur="5.22">dead in Messiah or those of us who are</text>
  <text start="98.579" dur="5.4">alive and remain we are going to go back</text>
  <text start="101.1" dur="7.769">up and be gathered up to Yahshua in the</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="7.32">clouds so right here we have all the</text>
  <text start="108.869" dur="4.771">feast of the first fruits and Passover</text>
  <text start="111.299" dur="5.221">we have Yahshua teaching the disciples</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="5.07">between the the 40 days after after</text>
  <text start="116.52" dur="4.86">firstfruits we have them ascending back</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="4.71">up into heaven 10 days before shavuot we</text>
  <text start="121.38" dur="4.26">have the ruach ha kodesh falling down on</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="4.26">the disciples at shavuot and then we</text>
  <text start="125.64" dur="5.94">have us rising up to meet Yahshua in the</text>
  <text start="127.68" dur="6.06">air at yom teruah so all the spring</text>
  <text start="131.58" dur="4.56">feasts connected to the first fall feast</text>
  <text start="133.74" dur="5.49">nected now you might say oh that looks</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="4.77">like a dub you well actually what it</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="7.59">actually looks like i&amp;#39;m going to show</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="10.68">you is it looks like a shin a Hebrew</text>
  <text start="146.82" dur="7.59">shin and as you can see that letter shin</text>
  <text start="151.59" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s a Hebrew letter and it has some</text>
  <text start="154.41" dur="6.51">interesting meanings it actually means</text>
  <text start="155.94" dur="6.84">to divide or to shatter to break and it</text>
  <text start="160.92" dur="4.11">also means fire in fact there&amp;#39;s a verse</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="6.33">that encompasses both of those meanings</text>
  <text start="165.03" dur="7.41">that&amp;#39;s in Jeremiah 23 29 it says is not</text>
  <text start="169.11" dur="5.69">my word like as a fire say away and like</text>
  <text start="172.44" dur="5.43">a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces</text>
  <text start="174.8" dur="5.41">so it symbolizes a fire and also like</text>
  <text start="177.87" dur="5.67">the letter of shin actually looks like</text>
  <text start="180.21" dur="5.28">teeth or to divide to break into and</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="3.63">what happens at yom teruah when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="185.49" dur="3.15">fulfilled well there&amp;#39;s a division</text>
  <text start="187.17" dur="2.82">there&amp;#39;s a division between the righteous</text>
  <text start="188.64" dur="3.69">and the wicked because the righteous are</text>
  <text start="189.99" dur="5.19">taken up and gathered to Yahshua in the</text>
  <text start="192.33" dur="5.97">air and of course the wicked are left</text>
  <text start="195.18" dur="4.68">down below and so there&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="198.3" dur="4.38">shattering that breaking and it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="199.86" dur="5.01">the fire of Jana the fire of yah that</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="4.5">fills those who love Him are taken up</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="5.07">into the air so I just thought that was</text>
  <text start="207.18" dur="5.49">really really neat it&amp;#39;s just a really</text>
  <text start="209.94" dur="6">awesome way that that Hebrew letter Shin</text>
  <text start="212.67" dur="6.36">connects those spring feasts to the</text>
  <text start="215.94" dur="5.85">first of the fall feasts so I pray that</text>
