  <text start="80" dur="4.44">and a comfortable low 70s warmth as I</text>
  <text start="83.18" dur="2.85">began to preach on the broom walk</text>

  <text start="137.48" dur="5.04">saw continued blessings on our business</text>
  <text start="139.45" dur="5.44">after two years of toil sometimes barely</text>
  <text start="142.52" dur="5.91">scraping by the business started</text>
  <text start="144.89" dur="6.42">becoming solvent we now had a cluster of</text>
  <text start="148.43" dur="4.35">very loyal and long-term clients because</text>
  <text start="151.31" dur="3.42">we were spending far less on gas and</text>
  <text start="152.78" dur="3.96">other traveling expenses due to living</text>
  <text start="154.73" dur="4.17">much closer to our clients we also had</text>
  <text start="156.74" dur="3.81">much more money for advertising it</text>
  <text start="158.9" dur="3.45">seemed even the new house as we gain</text>
  <text start="160.55" dur="4.98">were special in that a cancellation</text>
  <text start="162.35" dur="5.61">became extremely rare as our income</text>
  <text start="165.53" dur="4.38">steadily grew so did our confidence and</text>
  <text start="167.96" dur="4.11">for the first time since we started the</text>
  <text start="169.91" dur="5.13">business we actually had the luxury to</text>
  <text start="172.07" dur="5.13">turn some potential clients down at one</text>
  <text start="175.04" dur="3.81">point business was so brisk we even had</text>
  <text start="177.2" dur="3">the hire a temporary employee just to</text>
  <text start="178.85" dur="4.08">keep up with what yaad blessed us with</text>
  <text start="180.2" dur="4.41">these financial blessings were a welcome</text>
  <text start="182.93" dur="3.69">sight in light of an even greater</text>
  <text start="184.61" dur="5.19">blessing yah was about to drop into our</text>

  <text start="189.8" dur="6.03">girl in early two thousand six my wife</text>
  <text start="192.739" dur="4.741">had our fourth baby Naomi although once</text>
  <text start="195.83" dur="3.42">again our Midwife did not make it in</text>
  <text start="197.48" dur="4.56">time for the birth her assistant was</text>
  <text start="199.25" dur="4.35">present the entire evening the labor was</text>
  <text start="202.04" dur="3.51">thankfully brief for my wife but I</text>
  <text start="203.6" dur="4.71">remember her freeing feeling weak for</text>
  <text start="205.55" dur="4.8">weeks after the birth because of this I</text>
  <text start="208.31" dur="4.5">often held a little Naomi close to my</text>
  <text start="210.35" dur="4.62">chest cuddling her holding her and</text>
  <text start="212.81" dur="5.04">taking care of her more than any of our</text>

  <text start="220.7" dur="2.36">mine</text>
  <text start="221.26" dur="4.38">we must have carefully studied each</text>
  <text start="223.06" dur="4.89">other&amp;#39;s faces for weeks on end as Annika</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="4.08">slowly regained your strength I think</text>
  <text start="227.95" dur="3.95">because of this Naomi and I formed a</text>
  <text start="229.72" dur="5.04">special bond that I will always cherish</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="4.899">to congratulate us on our newborn baby I</text>
  <text start="234.76" dur="4.17">recall receiving an email from Monica&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.799" dur="4.291">grandfather which simply stated for</text>
  <text start="238.93" dur="4.919">children Daniel you have a well-balanced</text>
  <text start="241.09" dur="5.25">family our grandfather always been a man</text>
  <text start="243.849" dur="5.161">of few words that email deeply warmed my</text>
  <text start="246.34" dur="4.56">heart about six weeks after the birth</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="4.289">our Midwife visited our home for a</text>
  <text start="250.9" dur="3.99">routine final checkup she gazed at our</text>
  <text start="253.299" dur="3.391">living room then barely concealed wonder</text>
  <text start="254.89" dur="4.529">the new carpet the beautiful curtains</text>
  <text start="256.69" dur="5.759">the nice couch a far cry from our poorer</text>
  <text start="259.419" dur="5.191">surroundings back in Mariposa Yas really</text>
  <text start="262.449" dur="4.201">blessed us I explained and we sat down</text>
  <text start="264.61" dur="3.179">to just as we sat down to discuss Naomi</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="2.639">we also shared with her what had</text>
  <text start="267.789" dur="4.861">happened with the business and our lives</text>
  <text start="269.289" dur="4.831">in general wow I can really tell things</text>
  <text start="272.65" dur="3.75">have changed for you guys she said</text>
  <text start="274.12" dur="3.81">smiling at her home I&amp;#39;m so glad to hear</text>
  <text start="276.4" dur="4.47">you&amp;#39;ve recovered from a bankruptcy so</text>
  <text start="277.93" dur="4.769">fast as winter gave way to a brief</text>
  <text start="280.87" dur="3.69">spring and then spring quickly heated</text>
  <text start="282.699" dur="4.53">into a typical central Californian</text>
  <text start="284.56" dur="6.41">summer we were stunned at another piece</text>
  <text start="287.229" dur="6.06">of news Annika was pregnant again</text>
  <text start="290.97" dur="4.33">because we were firm believers in breast</text>
  <text start="293.289" dur="3.481">feeding our children and we knew the</text>
  <text start="295.3" dur="3.33">general science that the female body</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="3.78">normally won&amp;#39;t ovulate while</text>
  <text start="298.63" dur="3.42">breastfeeding we couldn&amp;#39;t believe naomi</text>
  <text start="300.55" dur="3.929">was still far from being weaned when</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="4.23">Annika became pregnant once again the</text>
  <text start="304.479" dur="4.201">house tending business had now grown far</text>
  <text start="306.28" dur="3.96">beyond our expectations not only were we</text>
  <text start="308.68" dur="3.76">cleaning residential houses but we</text>
  <text start="310.24" dur="5.14">gained our first commercial clients</text>
  <text start="312.44" dur="4.62">in a preschool three evenings a week as</text>
  <text start="315.38" dur="3.6">much fun as we had carting our four</text>
  <text start="317.06" dur="3.6">children around with us I began to</text>
  <text start="318.98" dur="3.09">realize that this hospital business was</text>
  <text start="320.66" dur="3.72">not going to be able to work for much</text>
  <text start="322.07" dur="4.11">longer Veronica now pregnant with our</text>
  <text start="324.38" dur="4.08">fifth child it was going to become</text>
  <text start="326.18" dur="4.08">absolutely impossible to bring the</text>
  <text start="328.46" dur="4.38">entire family with us on our jobs and</text>
  <text start="330.26" dur="4.53">the number of clients we now had made it</text>
  <text start="332.84" dur="3.87">impossible for either one of us to</text>
  <text start="334.79" dur="3.21">simply stay home with the children while</text>
  <text start="336.71" dur="3.69">the other worked as we had done for a</text>
  <text start="338" dur="6.06">period of time in Mariposa something had</text>
  <text start="340.4" dur="6.78">to give but we didn&amp;#39;t know what in a</text>
  <text start="344.06" dur="5.91">strange totally unexpected way yah began</text>
  <text start="347.18" dur="4.53">tugging at my heart I started thinking</text>
  <text start="349.97" dur="3.6">about the Torah observant congregation</text>
  <text start="351.71" dur="4.14">of Arkansas that we have visited during</text>
  <text start="353.57" dur="5.04">our preaching tour more than three years</text>
  <text start="355.85" dur="4.38">ago I&amp;#39;d continued to keep in touch over</text>
  <text start="358.61" dur="3.27">the intervening years with the burly</text>
  <text start="360.23" dur="3.96">pastor who had the long bushy black</text>
  <text start="361.88" dur="4.14">beard recently he&amp;#39;d experienced some</text>
  <text start="364.19" dur="3.24">difficulties of his marriage but it</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="4.17">formed us new home fellowship in</text>
  <text start="367.43" dur="4.32">southern Missouri though I had no desire</text>
  <text start="370.19" dur="3.33">to relocate into the humid state of</text>
  <text start="371.75" dur="4.26">Missouri it became an almost impossible</text>
  <text start="373.52" dur="4.98">task to remove the burden from my mind</text>
  <text start="376.01" dur="4.29">for some totally unexplained reason</text>
  <text start="378.5" dur="4.59">y&amp;#39;all wanted me to take the family east</text>
  <text start="380.3" dur="3.99">and start afresh in Missouri I knew we</text>
  <text start="383.09" dur="2.579">couldn&amp;#39;t continue with the present</text>
  <text start="384.29" dur="3.33">logistics of the house cleaning business</text>
  <text start="385.669" dur="5.041">but moving to missouri didn&amp;#39;t seem to</text>
  <text start="387.62" dur="4.65">make a whole lot of sense well there</text>
  <text start="390.71" dur="3.63">would be people who keep Shabbat keep</text>
  <text start="392.27" dur="3.41">the feasts and a like-minded I suggested</text>
  <text start="394.34" dur="3.38">to my wife won&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="395.68" dur="3.75">here we don&amp;#39;t have any fellowship at all</text>
  <text start="397.72" dur="4.289">and I might be able to learn something</text>
  <text start="399.43" dur="4.29">from the pastor the dark bearded burly</text>
  <text start="402.009" dur="3.63">pastor was also highly knowledgeable in</text>
  <text start="403.72" dur="3.6">natural health and supplements and it</text>
  <text start="405.639" dur="3.361">even launched a local radio show along</text>
  <text start="407.32" dur="4.56">with supplying several local health food</text>
  <text start="409" dur="3.99">stores with various nutrients it seemed</text>
  <text start="411.88" dur="4.409">like a great opportunity to learn about</text>
  <text start="412.99" dur="4.83">true Bible based health solutions after</text>
  <text start="416.289" dur="3.541">discussing the possibilities back and</text>
  <text start="417.82" dur="3.42">forth for weeks you finally made the</text>
  <text start="419.83" dur="3.209">decision to end our house cleaning</text>
  <text start="421.24" dur="3.959">business give away most of our furniture</text>
  <text start="423.039" dur="4.861">and take what little we could in our car</text>
  <text start="425.199" dur="4.201">eastward to Missouri the pastor of</text>
  <text start="427.9" dur="4.65">Missouri assured us we were welcome to</text>
  <text start="429.4" dur="5.04">stay with them as long as we wished one</text>
  <text start="432.55" dur="4.08">late summer evening only a few weeks</text>
  <text start="434.44" dur="4.83">before our scheduled departure annika</text>
  <text start="436.63" dur="4.83">voiced a concern I&amp;#39;m just not totally</text>
  <text start="439.27" dur="4.22">sure about this Daniel as something of a</text>
  <text start="441.46" dur="4.889">dark feeling about moving the Missouri I</text>
  <text start="443.49" dur="4.81">nodded somehow although not able to</text>
  <text start="446.349" dur="4.081">express it in concise words I had the</text>
  <text start="448.3" dur="3.57">same feeling on the one hand there was a</text>
  <text start="450.43" dur="3.39">deep peace knowing that we were doing</text>
  <text start="451.87" dur="4.56">exactly what yacht impressed upon us to</text>
  <text start="453.82" dur="5.279">do but on the other it was a brooding</text>
  <text start="456.43" dur="4.169">sense of danger it was as if we were not</text>
  <text start="459.099" dur="3.301">merely being called the move out and</text>
  <text start="460.599" dur="3.451">live with friends but that we were being</text>
  <text start="462.4" dur="4.259">given a serious mission fraught with</text>
  <text start="464.05" dur="3.839">peril try as we might we could not</text>
  <text start="466.659" dur="3.63">figure out why we felt such a</text>
  <text start="467.889" dur="4.621">disturbance after all three years ago</text>
  <text start="470.289" dur="4.141">when we had visited this pastor we had</text>
  <text start="472.51" dur="3.99">joyfully celebrated Passover and</text>
  <text start="474.43" dur="4.28">unleavened bread our sense of impending</text>
  <text start="476.5" dur="5.34">danger didn&amp;#39;t seem to make any sense in</text>
  <text start="478.71" dur="5.26">early August afternoon early three years</text>
  <text start="481.84" dur="4.59">in California we headed east with our</text>

  <text start="505.53" dur="4.83">come back Annika said cheerfully how</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="4.32">true her words were proved to be</text>
  <text start="510.36" dur="3.78">four days later we pulled into a long</text>

  <text start="522.18" dur="4.92">expecting our arrival the house was</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="5.94">completely dark not a single light shone</text>
  <text start="527.1" dur="5.72">for the windows how strange i murmured</text>
  <text start="530.25" dur="4.47">softly just as i was about to drive off</text>
  <text start="532.82" dur="4.329">convinced that we had come to the wrong</text>
  <text start="534.72" dur="4.4">place the burly pastor emerged from the</text>
  <text start="537.149" dur="5.25">home and came to give me a warm embrace</text>
  <text start="539.12" dur="5.11">it had been nearly three years since I</text>
