  <text start="0" dur="4.64">seven was when we had this major revival</text>
  <text start="1.77" dur="4.89">at my non-denominational Christian</text>
  <text start="4.64" dur="3.459">charismatic church and this was before I</text>
  <text start="6.66" dur="4.59">got into the Hebrew roots of the</text>
  <text start="8.099" dur="4.651">Christian faith and this evangelist</text>
  <text start="11.25" dur="3.75">preached on getting the sin out I mean</text>
  <text start="12.75" dur="4.32">get the sin out and it and it was it was</text>
  <text start="15" dur="3.449">it led to genuine repentance on my part</text>
  <text start="17.07" dur="3.209">and many that were going to the church</text>
  <text start="18.449" dur="3.811">that were sort of hypocrites or not</text>
  <text start="20.279" dur="5.401">genuinely converted it was an awesome</text>
  <text start="22.26" dur="5.279">time but what happened was by May of 98</text>
  <text start="25.68" dur="4.019">and this is about the time I left the</text>
  <text start="27.539" dur="4.74">church because I got a scholarship ended</text>
  <text start="29.699" dur="4.351">up to Oregon by about May to September</text>
  <text start="32.279" dur="3.511">of 98 which is when this bridge was</text>
  <text start="34.05" dur="5.96">being renovated and constructed and put</text>
  <text start="35.79" dur="8.28">in place the revival died at my church</text>
  <text start="40.01" dur="7">because the pastor was getting pressure</text>
  <text start="44.07" dur="3.809">from another pastor because we were we</text>
  <text start="47.01" dur="2.67">were doing a lot of street preaching</text>
  <text start="47.879" dur="4.081">down in downtown Austin it&amp;#39;s party</text>
  <text start="49.68" dur="3.69">Street and some of the church members of</text>
  <text start="51.96" dur="2.52">this neighboring church were down there</text>
  <text start="53.37" dur="2.939">at the party Street that we were</text>
  <text start="54.48" dur="4.44">rebuking and so this neighboring pastor</text>
  <text start="56.309" dur="4.23">sort of put pressure on Ron Raida to</text>
  <text start="58.92" dur="4.02">stop the preaching and so the revival</text>
  <text start="60.539" dur="5.19">just died it just died and Ron Rae</text>
  <text start="62.94" dur="4.74">compromised and and so what happened was</text>
  <text start="65.729" dur="3.781">because Ron Rae the pastor of the church</text>
  <text start="67.68" dur="3.93">compromised and then that evangelist</text>
  <text start="69.51" dur="3.78">wound up leaving the revival died and it</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="3.899">turned into this apostate strange fire</text>
  <text start="73.29" dur="3.75">because triggered attrition Center</text>
  <text start="75.509" dur="4.051">turned its name into life spring and</text>
  <text start="77.04" dur="5.66">they they became really apostate because</text>
  <text start="79.56" dur="6.66">they started adopting Dominion theology</text>
  <text start="82.7" dur="5.2">and this sort of third wave charismatic</text>
  <text start="86.22" dur="4.17">Pentecostal stuff that started in the</text>
  <text start="87.9" dur="4.98">late 90s and has really taken over the</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="3.74">Assemblies of God and Pentecostal and</text>
  <text start="92.88" dur="4.349">charismatic movements and it&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="94.13" dur="4.809">Dominion theology Joel&amp;#39;s army third wave</text>
  <text start="97.229" dur="3.151">it comes by a lot of different names the</text>
  <text start="98.939" dur="4.47">Bethel Church town and reading is in to</text>
  <text start="100.38" dur="5.34">this as well but what it says is that</text>
  <text start="103.409" dur="4.35">basically the Christian Church is going</text>
  <text start="105.72" dur="4.829">to take over the world they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="107.759" dur="5.07">take over Hollywood and the media and</text>
  <text start="110.549" dur="4.53">the schools the Christian Church is</text>
  <text start="112.829" dur="3.661">gonna take over the world and then once</text>
  <text start="115.079" dur="4.561">the Christian Church has completely</text>
  <text start="116.49" dur="5.489">taken over the world and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="4.589">mightily filled with the spirit then the</text>
  <text start="121.979" dur="5.131">Christ is gonna appear he&amp;#39;s just gonna</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="4.381">appear pre Duras and partial Frida&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="127.11" dur="2.67">also sort of helped under this because</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="4.82">they believe Jesus already came back</text>
  <text start="129.78" dur="5.73">metaphorically and 70 AD and and now</text>
  <text start="133.43" dur="3.97">you know they&amp;#39;re just waiting for the</text>
  <text start="135.51" dur="3.47">Christ to appear so this is what they</text>
  <text start="137.4" dur="3.51">believe and this is what happened so</text>

  <text start="226.5" dur="6.63">abomination of desolation but that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="229.86" dur="6.69">good shot so here&amp;#39;s something that you</text>
  <text start="233.13" dur="4.65">showed me so I think we all understand a</text>
  <text start="236.55" dur="2.61">lot of us who have been in the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="237.78" dur="3.39">roots messianic movement we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="239.16" dur="3.39">keeping Torah as much of torez possible</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="3.45">out of a love for Jesus out of a love</text>
  <text start="242.55" dur="4.5">for Yahshua trying to be filled with the</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="5.6">spirit walking in a spirit hearing his</text>
  <text start="247.05" dur="6.659">voice cultivating the intimacy with him</text>
  <text start="250.22" dur="5.35">we understand that Christians are the</text>
  <text start="253.709" dur="3.691">Catholic Protestant Eastern Orthodox</text>
  <text start="255.57" dur="3.289">Christians they&amp;#39;re going to be deceived</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="4.41">because they&amp;#39;re not obeying Torah</text>
  <text start="258.859" dur="4.301">they&amp;#39;re following apostate they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="261.81" dur="3.09">Sunday they&amp;#39;re eating pork and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.16" dur="3.06">there they&amp;#39;re not following the true</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="2.28">Jesus Christ of Nazareth so of course</text>
  <text start="266.22" dur="3.09">it&amp;#39;s going to be easy</text>
  <text start="267.18" dur="6.42">for an apostate Jesus to show up because</text>
  <text start="269.31" dur="6.419">they already serve a lawless Jesus Jews</text>
  <text start="273.6" dur="3.96">the Orthodox Jews who are trying to keep</text>
  <text start="275.729" dur="4.171">Torah as much as possible they lack the</text>
  <text start="277.56" dur="3.75">spirit they&amp;#39;ve rejected Messiah even the</text>
  <text start="279.9" dur="3.42">care acts like Nehemia Gordon that</text>
  <text start="281.31" dur="4.5">reject a lot of the Talmud they still</text>
  <text start="283.32" dur="4.74">reject Messiah and they they elevate</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="3.87">their own talent Talmudic beliefs which</text>
  <text start="288.06" dur="3.44">there is a care right Talmud by the way</text>
  <text start="289.68" dur="3.87">oh yes there is</text>
  <text start="291.5" dur="4.15">they may not call it that but there is</text>
  <text start="293.55" dur="5.16">so the Jews they&amp;#39;re gonna be deceived</text>
  <text start="295.65" dur="5.1">because they reject the Messiah as well</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="3.54">and they&amp;#39;re not really obeying Torah</text>
  <text start="300.75" dur="2.52">they&amp;#39;re obeying man-made traditions</text>
  <text start="302.25" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s why they don&amp;#39;t put the blue in</text>
  <text start="303.27" dur="4.38">their ZZ that&amp;#39;s why a lot of them won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="305.94" dur="3.33">even study - are they they study Talmud</text>
  <text start="307.65" dur="3.63">in the mission and Kabbalah but they</text>
  <text start="309.27" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t get into Torah they they will</text>
  <text start="311.28" dur="4.74">deliberately skip over Daniel chapter 9</text>
  <text start="313.47" dur="4.11">because of their the rabbi&amp;#39;s controlling</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="2.73">them it&amp;#39;s very like much like the</text>
  <text start="317.58" dur="2.55">Catholic Church where they go to the</text>
  <text start="318.75" dur="3.09">rabbi right then just like the Catholics</text>
  <text start="320.13" dur="3.3">go to their priests but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="321.84" dur="2.669">really walking in Torah they think they</text>
  <text start="323.43" dur="2.4">are but they&amp;#39;re not it&amp;#39;s very much like</text>
  <text start="324.509" dur="3.361">the first century Pharisees and</text>
  <text start="325.83" dur="3.36">Sadducees who claimed they were obeying</text>
  <text start="327.87" dur="2.549">Torah but actually they were following a</text>
  <text start="329.19" dur="3.449">bunch of manmade traditions that</text>
  <text start="330.419" dur="3.99">violated Torah so they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="332.639" dur="5.4">keeping Torah and so they&amp;#39;ll be deceived</text>
  <text start="334.409" dur="5.13">because they&amp;#39;re looking for a it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="338.039" dur="3.241">2,000 years ago they were looking for a</text>
  <text start="339.539" dur="3.271">warrior to destroy Rome and of course he</text>
  <text start="341.28" dur="3.69">came as a meek lamb to be slaughtered</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="3.419">and that&amp;#39;s why they rejected him because</text>
  <text start="344.97" dur="3.87">they weren&amp;#39;t wanting that now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="346.229" dur="3.72">looking for a meek lamb this new age</text>
  <text start="348.84" dur="2.699">Christ that&amp;#39;s what a lot of these</text>
  <text start="349.949" dur="3.301">Orthodox Jews are looking for well of</text>
  <text start="351.539" dur="3.901">course he&amp;#39;s coming as a warrior but this</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="4.259">son of perdition this false Yeshua he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="355.44" dur="3.599">gonna come with flatteries and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.509" dur="3.331">gonna be initially despised and then</text>
  <text start="359.039" dur="2.88">he&amp;#39;s gonna sort of grow bigger and</text>
  <text start="360.84" dur="3.93">bigger so he&amp;#39;s gonna come as like this</text>
  <text start="361.919" dur="5.22">meek lamb but he&amp;#39;s gonna be a dragon</text>
  <text start="364.77" dur="4.679">that speaks as a lamb was very deceptive</text>
  <text start="367.139" dur="4.201">so both the Jews who reject the true</text>
  <text start="369.449" dur="3.511">Torah in favor of their Talmudic</text>
  <text start="371.34" dur="4.29">traditions and the Christians who reject</text>
  <text start="372.96" dur="4.889">the true Jesus because they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="375.63" dur="3.96">following their Christian traditions</text>
  <text start="377.849" dur="4.861">rather than the Torah they&amp;#39;re both going</text>
  <text start="379.59" dur="6.12">to be deceived but how you might ask</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="4.26">this was just revealed to me today again</text>
  <text start="385.71" dur="2.67">yeah says you have to obey His</text>
  <text start="386.97" dur="2.91">commandments and hearken to his voice so</text>
  <text start="388.38" dur="2.099">I obeyed the commandment of keeping</text>
  <text start="389.88" dur="2.52">Sokoto</text>
  <text start="390.479" dur="3.18">but I obeyed his voice to come here</text>
  <text start="392.4" dur="3.21">because there&amp;#39;s nothing in scripture</text>
  <text start="393.659" dur="5.041">that says to come to the Jordan bridge</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="4.169">in state and Oregon but he told me to</text>
  <text start="398.7" dur="1.93">come here and was only after I obeyed</text>
  <text start="399.779" dur="2.711">him that he</text>
  <text start="400.63" dur="4.17">revealed to me this thing and that is</text>
  <text start="402.49" dur="4.23">how will the Hebrew roots Messianics who</text>
  <text start="404.8" dur="4.53">have not gotten the sin of their lives</text>
  <text start="406.72" dur="5.19">so they they they they accept Yahshua</text>
  <text start="409.33" dur="4.32">right they serve Yahshua they really are</text>
  <text start="411.91" dur="2.91">trying to keep the Torah and and trying</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="3.42">to be fold the spirit but they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="414.82" dur="3.72">gotten Schneider lies and because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="2.61">seen a lot of strange fire over the</text>
  <text start="418.54" dur="2.46">years I&amp;#39;ve been in the movement Hebrew</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="2.46">roots movement for 16 years there was a</text>
  <text start="421" dur="4.44">lot of strange fire out there I mean</text>
  <text start="422.14" dur="5.34">Monta Judah he rejects Hebrews and</text>
  <text start="425.44" dur="3.51">there&amp;#39;s just there&amp;#39;s so many so much</text>
  <text start="427.48" dur="4.41">strange fire out there in the Messianic</text>
  <text start="428.95" dur="5.82">world so how are they going to be</text>
  <text start="431.89" dur="5.04">deceived I mean they know about the</text>
  <text start="434.77" dur="3.96">feast days they know about the true</text>
  <text start="436.93" dur="3.84">Jewish Yahshua of Nazareth they know</text>
  <text start="438.73" dur="3.33">about the Torah and there of course a</text>
  <text start="440.77" dur="3.96">lot of whom do breaked horror because</text>
  <text start="442.06" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re living in sin but how are they</text>
  <text start="444.73" dur="3.84">going to be deceived well yah showed me</text>
  <text start="446.47" dur="6.9">when I got here he literally showed me</text>
  <text start="448.57" dur="6.3">as I was as I was across the sea that</text>
  <text start="453.37" dur="2.61">wooden footbridge I crossed that wooden</text>
  <text start="454.87" dur="3.6">footbridge and there&amp;#39;s a little thing</text>
  <text start="455.98" dur="6.15">place there to stand and right when I</text>
  <text start="458.47" dur="5.37">was there ya showed me so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="462.13" dur="3.39">growing movement within the Messianic</text>
  <text start="463.84" dur="4.62">Hebrew roots about this greater Exodus</text>
  <text start="465.52" dur="4.56">and now I know not everyone who teaches</text>
  <text start="468.46" dur="3.09">the greater Exodus believes this but</text>
  <text start="470.08" dur="3.36">there&amp;#39;s a growing number of people</text>
  <text start="471.55" dur="3.38">especially the leadership of the</text>
  <text start="473.44" dur="3.87">Messianic here roots movements that</text>
  <text start="474.93" dur="4.3">teach about this greater Exodus and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.31" dur="4.38">really a perversion of Revelation 12 is</text>
  <text start="479.23" dur="5.58">what it is it&amp;#39;s a perversion but they</text>
  <text start="481.69" dur="5.28">teach that because the pre-tribulation</text>
  <text start="484.81" dur="3.9">Christian rapture theory is wrong which</text>
  <text start="486.97" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re right the pre-tribulation</text>
  <text start="488.71" dur="3.48">Christian rapture theory is nonsense it</text>
  <text start="490.93" dur="3.96">was invented in the eighteen hundreds</text>
  <text start="492.19" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s a nonsense but they react too</text>
  <text start="494.89" dur="2.64">strongly and they go to the opposite</text>
  <text start="496.42" dur="3.59">stream so they say they&amp;#39;re actually</text>

  <text start="646.87" dur="5.03">perversion of revelation 12 which is</text>
  <text start="648.91" dur="5.97">this greater Exodus teaching is that</text>
  <text start="651.9" dur="6.19">these Hebrew roots and Messianics that</text>

  <text start="669.94" dur="4.98">what&amp;#39;s gonna happen is is that um so the</text>
  <text start="673.57" dur="5.25">Ark of the Covenant gonna be revealed</text>
  <text start="674.92" dur="5.52">and it&amp;#39;s gonna be revealed and this</text>

  <text start="688.36" dur="5.4">literal glory cloud like a Chicana glory</text>
  <text start="691.089" dur="4.141">cloud and the Hebrew roots and</text>

  <text start="705.91" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re going to basically be convinced</text>
  <text start="708.97" dur="4.59">as they go into this glory cloud they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="711.85" dur="2.82">gonna be convinced this is truly Yahshua</text>
  <text start="713.56" dur="2.52">and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re gonna be reprobate</text>
  <text start="714.67" dur="3.66">at that point I mean it&amp;#39;s over they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="716.08" dur="4.14">gone they are they&amp;#39;re convinced he is</text>
  <text start="718.33" dur="4.29">the real Yahshua of Nazareth they are</text>
  <text start="720.22" dur="3.66">convinced and then they&amp;#39;re gonna say</text>
  <text start="722.62" dur="2.969">look we were right about 1st</text>
  <text start="723.88" dur="3.6">Thessalonians 4 we&amp;#39;re not caught up in</text>
  <text start="725.589" dur="3.961">the sky we go into the cloud we meet</text>

  <text start="729.55" dur="5.12">Chicana glory cloud that&amp;#39;s actually this</text>
  <text start="732.01" dur="4.56">delusion that Yahweh himself sends and</text>
  <text start="734.67" dur="3.94">that&amp;#39;s how they&amp;#39;re gonna be deceived so</text>
  <text start="736.57" dur="3.38">it&amp;#39;s very important especially if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="738.61" dur="3.27">been in the Messianic Hebrew roots</text>
  <text start="739.95" dur="4.42">movement for a while or even for a short</text>
  <text start="741.88" dur="5.91">time that you take first Thessalonians</text>
  <text start="744.37" dur="4.68">for literally we are literally gonna be</text>
  <text start="747.79" dur="2.7">caught up our bodies are gonna be</text>
  <text start="749.05" dur="3.21">transformed in a twinkling of an eye</text>
  <text start="750.49" dur="4.71">this is also in 1st Corinthians 15 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="752.26" dur="7.17">in Daniel 12 it&amp;#39;s in Revelation 10 and</text>
  <text start="755.2" dur="6.9">11 we&amp;#39;re literally gonna be caught up so</text>
  <text start="759.43" dur="6.69">any event that happens before that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="762.1" dur="5.489">not the real Yahshua okay those who are</text>
  <text start="766.12" dur="3.9">going to be alive and remain those are</text>
  <text start="767.589" dur="3.75">the philadelphians you&amp;#39;ve got to be in</text>
  <text start="770.02" dur="2.61">Philadelphia before this goes down</text>
  <text start="771.339" dur="2.94">because once the abomination of</text>
  <text start="772.63" dur="3.6">desolation goes down when perm is</text>
  <text start="774.279" dur="5.851">fulfilled it&amp;#39;s just a very short time</text>
  <text start="776.23" dur="6.6">between Purim and Passover unleavened</text>
  <text start="780.13" dur="5.24">bread and these two witnesses they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="782.83" dur="6.27">gonna start their 1260 day ministry on</text>
  <text start="785.37" dur="5.32">lamb day because lambda is always 1260</text>
  <text start="789.1" dur="3.33">days before yom teruah three and a half</text>
  <text start="790.69" dur="4.5">years later and yom teruah of course is</text>
  <text start="792.43" dur="3.69">the fulfillment of the resurrection now</text>
  <text start="795.19" dur="2.34">we still don&amp;#39;t know the day or the hour</text>
  <text start="796.12" dur="2.55">even when they start because we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="797.53" dur="3.15">know if that three and a half days that</text>
  <text start="798.67" dur="3.58">they lay dead is part of the 12600 or</text>
  <text start="800.68" dur="4.21">not so we see we Sylvan</text>
  <text start="802.25" dur="4.68">the our but but by the time the two</text>
  <text start="804.89" dur="4.11">witnesses begin their ministry the woman</text>
  <text start="806.93" dur="3.57">in Revelation 12 was already in the safe</text>
  <text start="809" dur="4.89">place because the woman&amp;#39;s only there for</text>
  <text start="810.5" dur="6.72">1260 days as well so right around Lamm</text>
  <text start="813.89" dur="7.2">day of the year that this Purim decree</text>
  <text start="817.22" dur="5.16">goes down which is only like 30 to 60</text>
  <text start="821.09" dur="5.1">days later depending on if you have an 8</text>
  <text start="822.38" dur="5.46">hour bet or not you&amp;#39;ve already got to be</text>
  <text start="826.19" dur="3">a Philadelphian believer with all the</text>
  <text start="827.84" dur="2.52">sin out and you know learning the word</text>

  <text start="840.59" dur="3.69">very important that you understand this</text>
  <text start="842.24" dur="3.81">before we get to a Purim and remember</text>
  <text start="844.28" dur="4.2">Yahshua even said pray that your flight</text>
  <text start="846.05" dur="4.83">not be in winter or on a Shabbat because</text>
  <text start="848.48" dur="4.92">then we&amp;#39;ll Great Tribulation and what is</text>
  <text start="850.88" dur="4.32">permits a two-day sort of Sabbath rest</text>
  <text start="853.4" dur="2.97">in the winter that&amp;#39;s when the</text>

  <text start="871.339" dur="4.5">salvation you don&amp;#39;t ever gonna die</text>
  <text start="872.33" dur="4.98">tomorrow or tonight so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="875.839" dur="2.851">important that we understand perm and</text>
  <text start="877.31" dur="2.64">how it fits into the abomination of</text>
  <text start="878.69" dur="4.71">desolation because this deception is</text>
  <text start="879.95" dur="5.22">gonna be so incredibly deceptive I mean</text>
  <text start="883.4" dur="3.3">this is when Yahshua says look if they</text>

  <text start="890.96" dur="4.8">people to start looking for Yahshua in a</text>
