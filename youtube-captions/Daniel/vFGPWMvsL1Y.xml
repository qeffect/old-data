  <text start="3.24" dur="6.45">our restoration ministries it is January</text>
  <text start="4.97" dur="6.669">the 4th 2016 evening of January the 24th</text>
  <text start="9.69" dur="6.41">as we&amp;#39;re getting toward the end of the</text>
  <text start="11.639" dur="9.871">tenth hebrew month Gunther really tough</text>
  <text start="16.1" dur="8.439">lasts several days because on Wednesday</text>
  <text start="21.51" dur="6.54">night I suddenly learned from my dad</text>
  <text start="24.539" dur="7.68">that his younger sister one of his</text>
  <text start="28.05" dur="7.79">younger sisters my Aunt Emily she passed</text>
  <text start="32.219" dur="9.721">away rather suddenly on Wednesday night</text>
  <text start="35.84" dur="9.52">and she was only 55 she was very young</text>
  <text start="41.94" dur="5.49">very healthy for most of her life except</text>
  <text start="45.36" dur="5.01">that in May of this year she was</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="4.98">diagnosed with kidney cancer just in one</text>
  <text start="50.37" dur="4.95">of her kidneys so they wound up removing</text>
  <text start="52.41" dur="6.03">her kidney along with some other lymph</text>
  <text start="55.32" dur="5.399">nodes to excise the cancer from her and</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="4.08">you know we thought things were going to</text>
  <text start="60.719" dur="3.781">be good unfortunately by the time they</text>
  <text start="62.52" dur="5.31">removed it she was so advanced that the</text>
  <text start="64.5" dur="6.299">cancer had spread and it spread to her</text>
  <text start="67.83" dur="4.98">lungs but even spreading into her lungs</text>
  <text start="70.799" dur="4.471">you know she still had a 50-50 chance of</text>
  <text start="72.81" dur="6.21">survival but over the course of the</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="6.27">summer the cancer unfortunately spread</text>
  <text start="79.02" dur="4.739">into her bones and once it gets into</text>
  <text start="81.54" dur="4.469">your bones it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text>
  <text start="83.759" dur="4.981">recover although you know I was praying</text>
  <text start="86.009" dur="3.93">for her constantly and I I believe that</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="2.19">she was really going to overcome that</text>
  <text start="89.939" dur="3.331">she was gonna beat this thing just</text>
  <text start="90.93" dur="6.21">because of how young she is and she&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="9.09">very strong bold woman and them but</text>
  <text start="97.14" dur="8.909">unfortunately on Sunday night she she</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="5.939">was rushed to the hospital and over the</text>
  <text start="106.049" dur="5.341">coerced to the next few days her organs</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="7.32">began shutting down her eyes remain</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="6.21">dilated for I think 12 hours and she was</text>
  <text start="115.619" dur="4.32">basically brained at at that point so</text>
  <text start="117.6" dur="5.61">they took her off life support and she</text>
  <text start="119.939" dur="5.501">passed away wednesday night out of all</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="4.51">my brother my dad had</text>
  <text start="125.44" dur="4.32">he&amp;#39;s one of six siblings and out of all</text>
  <text start="127.72" dur="5.67">the aunts and uncles that I that I know</text>
  <text start="129.76" dur="5.58">I was closest to my Aunt Emily just</text>
  <text start="133.39" dur="5.28">because my dad would take us to visit</text>
  <text start="135.34" dur="4.95">her quite a bit because for quite a</text>
  <text start="138.67" dur="3.6">number of years during my childhood she</text>
  <text start="140.29" dur="6.27">was single she didn&amp;#39;t get married till</text>
  <text start="142.27" dur="6.06">later and so she was always free to to</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="3.78">get together with us and I I remember</text>
  <text start="148.33" dur="3.12">visiting her quite often because she</text>
