  <text start="10.349" dur="5.37">the circumcision of the spirit and so we</text>
  <text start="13.71" dur="4.38">belted out the worship song as we drove</text>
  <text start="15.719" dur="5.551">to the forest covered hills of northern</text>
  <text start="18.09" dur="5.4">Alabama annika held a walkie-talkie that</text>
  <text start="21.27" dur="4.08">allowed her a blowout us to hear John</text>
  <text start="23.49" dur="4.14">smart and his wife in the car ahead of</text>
  <text start="25.35" dur="4.679">us as he let out the worship song and we</text>
  <text start="27.63" dur="4.02">followed along our boys laughed and</text>
  <text start="30.029" dur="4.411">giggled in the backseat as our voices</text>
  <text start="31.65" dur="5.22">rose we had met John and his wife just a</text>
  <text start="34.44" dur="4.56">few days ago he pastored a tiny rural</text>
  <text start="36.87" dur="4.259">sabbath-keeping congregation they were</text>
  <text start="39" dur="4.59">not messianic but they were very open to</text>
  <text start="41.129" dur="4.321">new truth what impressed me most about</text>
  <text start="43.59" dur="4.289">John was his tender hearted humility</text>
  <text start="45.45" dur="4.949">though a towering man of over six foot</text>
  <text start="47.879" dur="4.471">two with muscular arms the brokenhearted</text>
  <text start="50.399" dur="3.631">pneus with which he preached was obvious</text>
  <text start="52.35" dur="3.99">to anyone who listened to him for more</text>
  <text start="54.03" dur="4.47">than just a few minutes it was safe to</text>
  <text start="56.34" dur="6.2">say that I instantly like this pastor as</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="6.59">soon as I admit him on Sabbath morning</text>
  <text start="62.54" dur="4.5">we pulled up to the small building the</text>
  <text start="65.09" dur="4.29">thick Alabama forced blotted out the</text>
  <text start="67.04" dur="4.08">spring Sun overhead I remember thinking</text>
  <text start="69.38" dur="4.11">that this place looked more like some</text>
  <text start="71.12" dur="4.83">sort of 19th century cottage than a</text>
  <text start="73.49" dur="4.08">modern-day house of worship inside</text>
  <text start="75.95" dur="4.02">hundreds of drawings cover the walls</text>
  <text start="77.57" dur="4.92">pictures scroll out my toddlers and</text>
  <text start="79.97" dur="4.02">small children family SAT together and I</text>
  <text start="82.49" dur="3.51">was immediately drawn by the way this</text>
  <text start="83.99" dur="4.53">place did not divide the families up</text>
  <text start="86" dur="4.17">like so many churches do it was clear</text>
  <text start="88.52" dur="3.9">the children to not go to some separate</text>
  <text start="90.17" dur="4.589">priestly church but SAT with their</text>
  <text start="92.42" dur="5.37">parents in fact the whole place felt</text>
  <text start="94.759" dur="4.441">more like a home in a church John his</text>
  <text start="97.79" dur="3.829">gray eyes matching his graying hair</text>
  <text start="99.2" dur="4.41">stood behind a simple wooden pulpit</text>
  <text start="101.619" dur="4.781">tonic and I quickly took our seats</text>
  <text start="103.61" dur="4.47">holding our boys on our laps and on this</text>
  <text start="106.4" dur="4.02">Sabbath morning we have special guests</text>
  <text start="108.08" dur="4.56">with us Daniel and his wife all the way</text>
  <text start="110.42" dur="3.48">from Oregon they will be doing some open</text>
  <text start="112.64" dur="3.479">air preaching on the campus here in</text>
  <text start="113.9" dur="4.35">Birmingham next week several people</text>
  <text start="116.119" dur="4.051">smiled at us as babies cried children</text>
  <text start="118.25" dur="4.77">laughed making both of us feel right at</text>
  <text start="120.17" dur="4.91">home and in honor of our guests I&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="123.02" dur="4.95">Daniel to give us a word this morning I</text>
  <text start="125.08" dur="5.77">stared in wide-eyed surprised at Anya I</text>

  <text start="130.85" dur="3.9">smiled at me and took Isaiah out of my</text>
  <text start="132.769" dur="4.711">lap balancing both our boys on each of</text>
  <text start="134.75" dur="4.5">her knees not prepared with a sermon i</text>
  <text start="137.48" dur="3.86">decided to preach him what the i was</text>
  <text start="139.25" dur="4.819">placing on my heart even as</text>
  <text start="141.34" dur="4.41">walking for the open gripping both sides</text>
  <text start="144.069" dur="5.221">of the wooden surface I asked everyone</text>
  <text start="145.75" dur="5.34">to turn to Zechariah 14 I spent the next</text>
  <text start="149.29" dur="4.41">hour painting a vivid picture in the</text>
  <text start="151.09" dur="4.83">minds of my listeners Yahshua ruling and</text>
  <text start="153.7" dur="4.08">reigning from a glittering Jerusalem the</text>

  <text start="163.75" dur="4.799">celebrated by every tribe tongue and</text>
  <text start="165.76" dur="4.53">people my listeners had only been</text>
  <text start="168.549" dur="4.171">keeping the Sabbath day and knew next to</text>
  <text start="170.29" dur="3.9">nothing about the Hebrew feasts I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="172.72" dur="3.69">sure exactly how the congregation would</text>
  <text start="174.19" dur="4.5">receive the message but I had nothing to</text>
  <text start="176.41" dur="3.78">worry about that afternoon as they</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="3.6">walked across the gravely parking lot</text>
  <text start="180.19" dur="3.87">back to our van several people shook our</text>
  <text start="182.29" dur="3.539">hands smiling thanking me for the</text>
  <text start="184.06" dur="4.17">message and asking many questions about</text>
  <text start="185.829" dur="3.75">the Hebrew feast days once again it was</text>
  <text start="188.23" dur="4.38">so thrilling to find the pure-hearted</text>

  <text start="192.61" dur="4.89">day we arrived at the TV station studios</text>

  <text start="259.239" dur="2.701">preaching it seemed that the</text>
  <text start="260.5" dur="3.81">interviewers were getting nervous and</text>
  <text start="261.94" dur="3.9">wanted to end the show afterward as we</text>

  <text start="343.48" dur="4.11">Alabama at Birmingham was situated right</text>
  <text start="345.28" dur="4.83">in the heart of downtown which made</text>
  <text start="347.59" dur="4.08">finding a place to park difficult we</text>
  <text start="350.11" dur="3.24">finally managed to squeeze into a paid</text>

  <text start="401.11" dur="3.63">toward a bench covered area in front of</text>
  <text start="402.61" dur="3.87">the student union this looks like a</text>
  <text start="404.74" dur="4.02">perfect place to preach I said as I</text>
  <text start="406.48" dur="4.05">jumped on top of the bench I began to</text>
  <text start="408.76" dur="5.28">preach on 1st Corinthians 6 9 through 11</text>
  <text start="410.53" dur="6.3">and 1st John 3 6 to 11 within 10 minutes</text>

  <text start="426.76" dur="3.84">either you are right and the scripture</text>
  <text start="429.01" dur="3.63">is wrong or you were wrong and the</text>

  <text start="435.46" dur="4.14">yelled at me for judging as the crowd</text>
  <text start="437.65" dur="4.65">began to grow around us I turned to John</text>
