  <text start="68.34" dur="4.29">the morning from that Sunday morning and</text>
  <text start="70.01" dur="5.83">they began to speak in various tongues</text>

  <text start="75.84" dur="2.069">Roman Empire who spoke different</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="2.551">languages</text>
  <text start="77.909" dur="3.631">they had gathered at the temple for the</text>
  <text start="79.53" dur="3.269">feast of Pentecost as they would do</text>
  <text start="81.54" dur="3.6">every year and they started</text>
  <text start="82.799" dur="5.18">understanding their own language and a</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="5.159">lot of the Jewish leadership were</text>
  <text start="87.979" dur="4.241">astounded because they said wow these</text>
  <text start="90.299" dur="3.481">users are just you know basic fishermen</text>
  <text start="92.22" dur="2.91">how do they they don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="93.78" dur="3.03">education how to take all these</text>
  <text start="95.13" dur="3.239">languages and</text>
  <text start="96.81" dur="8.309">at first they were accused of being</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="8.491">drunk and Peter delivered his famous</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="4.741">sermon in which 3,000 people were</text>
  <text start="106.86" dur="5.369">converted so it was a it was a powerful</text>
  <text start="109.86" dur="5.19">day in which the holy spirit first began</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="4.861">to fill people in mass you know in large</text>
  <text start="115.05" dur="4.62">groups and numbers fulfilling the</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="5.16">prophecies in both Joel Peter actually</text>
  <text start="119.67" dur="4.949">quotes in in the book of Acts on the day</text>
  <text start="122.25" dur="4.979">of Pentecost so what&amp;#39;s interesting is</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="5.551">that you buy two loaves of bread</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="5.551">we bought two loaves of challah to wave</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="5.03">on Sunday our Saturday night as</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="5.4">Chevrolet begins and it&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="5.08">offering in all of the Torah that</text>
  <text start="138.18" dur="6.779">actually allows you to put leaven in the</text>
  <text start="140.28" dur="6.39">bread typically when a bread is given as</text>
  <text start="144.959" dur="3.541">an offering its unleavened bread there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="146.67" dur="3.93">not having eleven in it if you remember</text>
  <text start="148.5" dur="4.5">back and Passover we removed all the</text>
  <text start="150.6" dur="3.66">leaven from our homes and the bread we</text>
  <text start="153" dur="3.08">ate was unleavened because leaven</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="4.89">represents sin but there is actually a</text>
  <text start="156.08" dur="5.68">parable that Jesus that Yahshua tells in</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="4.89">which leaven is likened unto the Holy</text>
  <text start="161.76" dur="3.78">Spirit because he says the kingdom of</text>
  <text start="164.04" dur="2.669">God is like a woman working 11</text>
  <text start="165.54" dur="3.96">throughout the dough until the dough is</text>
  <text start="166.709" dur="4.081">filled with the leaven and so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.5" dur="2.64">showing that eleven actually doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="3.93">always represent sin they can represent</text>
  <text start="172.14" dur="6.3">the Holy Spirit and so we have these two</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="7.17">leavened bread that we wave on Shavuot</text>
  <text start="178.44" dur="5.82">that we eat on Pentecost Shavuot to</text>
  <text start="181.89" dur="6.48">represent that it represents the tour in</text>
  <text start="184.26" dur="6.84">the spirit it represents Judah and</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="4.41">Israel it represents the first covenant</text>
  <text start="191.1" dur="4.8">and the renewed covenant there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="192.78" dur="4.59">of symbology in those two loaves of</text>
  <text start="195.9" dur="3.3">bread that we raise and that we wave</text>
