  <text start="2.73" dur="3.69">restoration ministries it&amp;#39;s a new goal</text>
  <text start="4.859" dur="3.99">of the ministry now that I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="6.42" dur="4.679">have a podcast not just for Shabbat but</text>
  <text start="8.849" dur="7.741">I also want to have a midweek podcast so</text>
  <text start="11.099" dur="9.51">this is my midweek podcast for 11 24</text>
  <text start="16.59" dur="6.09">2010 and the topic today is can women</text>
  <text start="20.609" dur="4.801">teach biblical doctrine I know this is a</text>
  <text start="22.68" dur="3.99">pretty hot topic always very</text>
  <text start="25.41" dur="3.42">controversial especially when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="26.67" dur="4.439">presented and to two men and women</text>
  <text start="28.83" dur="3.9">depending on what perspective you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="31.109" dur="4.47">coming from but I want to make this very</text>
  <text start="32.73" dur="5.489">very clear um and very very to the point</text>
  <text start="35.579" dur="5.401">I want to start off with the passage</text>
  <text start="38.219" dur="5.311">that often causes a lot of controversy</text>
  <text start="40.98" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s found in the the Brit hadashah the</text>
  <text start="43.53" dur="6.39">renewed covenant in first Timothy</text>
  <text start="45.48" dur="6.27">chapter 2 starting in verse 9 in like</text>
  <text start="49.92" dur="4.26">manner also that women adorn themselves</text>
  <text start="51.75" dur="5.699">in modest apparel with shamefacedness</text>
  <text start="54.18" dur="6.51">and sobriety not with braided hair or</text>
  <text start="57.449" dur="5.101">gold or pearls or costly array but which</text>
  <text start="60.69" dur="4.32">becomes women professing godliness with</text>
  <text start="62.55" dur="4.98">good works let the woman learn in</text>
  <text start="65.01" dur="4.679">silence with all subjection but I suffer</text>
  <text start="67.53" dur="3.96">not a woman to teach nor to usurp</text>
  <text start="69.689" dur="4.801">authority over the man but to be in</text>
  <text start="71.49" dur="5.79">silence for Adam was first formed and</text>
  <text start="74.49" dur="4.769">then Eve hava and Adam was not deceived</text>
  <text start="77.28" dur="4.5">but the woman being deceived was in the</text>
  <text start="79.259" dur="4.201">transgression notwithstanding she shall</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="3.629">be saved in childbearing if they</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="5.549">continue in faith and charity and</text>
  <text start="85.409" dur="7.051">holiness with sobriety now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="89.009" dur="5.941">actually quite a lot that rabbi shallow</text>
  <text start="92.46" dur="4.799">Apostle Paul pens here in in first</text>
  <text start="94.95" dur="5.91">Timothy too but I want to deal primarily</text>
  <text start="97.259" dur="6">with verse 12 but I suffer not a woman</text>
  <text start="100.86" dur="4.59">to teach in order usurp authority over</text>
  <text start="103.259" dur="6.061">the man but to be in silence Paul makes</text>
  <text start="105.45" dur="6.779">it very clear that a woman is not given</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="5.4">the role or the authority to teach to</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="5.85">teach biblical doctrine now there are</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="5.009">three examples in Scripture that people</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="3.811">will try to use to say that this</text>
  <text start="119.729" dur="3.03">contradicts what Paul was teaching that</text>
  <text start="121.89" dur="2.519">Paul didn&amp;#39;t really know what he was</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="4.021">talking about but I want to deal with</text>
  <text start="124.409" dur="4.201">each of these three examples the first</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="3.66">example can be found and we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="3.57">going to work backwards from the Brit</text>
  <text start="130.44" dur="3.06">hadashah back the Torah the first</text>
  <text start="132.18" dur="3.66">example would be an ax</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="5.82">18-24 want to just go ahead and turn to</text>
  <text start="135.84" dur="5.7">that acts 18 24 and here we have an</text>
  <text start="139.32" dur="4.95">example where a very young and zealous</text>
  <text start="141.54" dur="4.47">believer Apollo&amp;#39;s is out preaching the</text>
  <text start="144.27" dur="4.47">word and he doesn&amp;#39;t have quite all the</text>
  <text start="146.01" dur="5.37">truth and so a husband-and-wife team run</text>
  <text start="148.74" dur="5.219">into him it&amp;#39;s priscilla and aquila and</text>
  <text start="151.38" dur="4.8">it says here and a certain jew named</text>
  <text start="153.959" dur="4.171">Apollo&amp;#39;s born at Alexandria an eloquent</text>
  <text start="156.18" dur="4.05">man and mighty in the scriptures came to</text>
  <text start="158.13" dur="4.079">Ephesus this man was instructed in the</text>
  <text start="160.23" dur="3.87">way of Yahweh and being fervent in the</text>
  <text start="162.209" dur="4.321">spirit he spoke and taught diligently</text>
  <text start="164.1" dur="4.8">the things of Yahweh knowing only the</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="4.86">immersion of jochen on and he began to</text>
  <text start="168.9" dur="4.86">speak boldly in the synagogue whom when</text>
  <text start="171.39" dur="4.08">Aquila and Priscilla had heard they took</text>
  <text start="173.76" dur="4.71">him unto them and expounded unto Him the</text>
  <text start="175.47" dur="5.37">way of Yahweh more perfectly okay so</text>
  <text start="178.47" dur="5.519">here they say look you know Priscilla</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="5.28">the woman look she&amp;#39;s teaching well again</text>
  <text start="183.989" dur="4.051">this doesn&amp;#39;t take a rocket scientist to</text>
  <text start="186.12" dur="3.869">figure out if you look at the context of</text>
  <text start="188.04" dur="3.87">what&amp;#39;s being presented here it&amp;#39;s clearly</text>
  <text start="189.989" dur="3.661">that the husband and wife are both</text>
  <text start="191.91" dur="4.62">together and they&amp;#39;re ministering to</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="3.99">Apollo&amp;#39;s in other words any expounding</text>
  <text start="196.53" dur="3.03">that the woman might be doing is</text>
  <text start="197.64" dur="4.17">completely under the headship of her</text>
  <text start="199.56" dur="4.83">husband he&amp;#39;s standing right there he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="201.81" dur="4.17">expounding she&amp;#39;s supporting him that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="204.39" dur="4.44">that that&amp;#39;s very clear so that in no way</text>
  <text start="205.98" dur="5.67">contradicts what what Apostles travel</text>
  <text start="208.83" dur="4.62">states and first immunity to the second</text>
  <text start="211.65" dur="5.04">example can be found in both second</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="5.64">chronicles 34 and second Kings 22 those</text>
  <text start="216.69" dur="5.579">are both same passages and talking about</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="4.98">Hulda the prophetess now hold of the</text>
  <text start="222.269" dur="5.101">prophetess what she does is she gives a</text>
  <text start="224.07" dur="5.46">warning a proclamation and it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="227.37" dur="4.23">clear warning to those that she&amp;#39;s giving</text>
  <text start="229.53" dur="5.79">it to she is not anyway teaching</text>
  <text start="231.6" dur="6.69">doctrine she&amp;#39;s not trying to instruct</text>
  <text start="235.32" dur="5.1">people on how the Torah works or how</text>
  <text start="238.29" dur="4.44">were to apply it to our lives she simply</text>
  <text start="240.42" dur="3.72">gives a very black-and-white warning</text>
  <text start="242.73" dur="4.53">says look this is what you&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="244.14" dur="6.06">going to do he&amp;#39;s going to destroy and</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="4.38">he&amp;#39;s going to be tender to to a certain</text>
  <text start="250.2" dur="3.569">king is going to destroy these apostates</text>
  <text start="251.64" dur="3.24">relights she&amp;#39;s just very clear making a</text>
  <text start="253.769" dur="2.641">proclamation there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with</text>
  <text start="254.88" dur="3.09">a woman doing that in fact we see</text>
  <text start="256.41" dur="4.23">examples of prophetess is all through</text>
  <text start="257.97" dur="5.97">Scripture but in no way is she teaching</text>
  <text start="260.64" dur="5.68">doctrine so again that example is in no</text>
  <text start="263.94" dur="5.29">way contradicting what</text>
  <text start="266.32" dur="5.37">apostle shot will penned the third and</text>
  <text start="269.23" dur="4.38">final example which is very popular that</text>
  <text start="271.69" dur="3.21">people try to use as judges four and</text>
  <text start="273.61" dur="4.26">five and this of course is talking about</text>
  <text start="274.9" dur="4.74">Deborah now I don&amp;#39;t need to mention the</text>
  <text start="277.87" dur="3.57">fact that Deborah who was a judge also</text>
  <text start="279.64" dur="4.08">had a husband who she was submitted to</text>
  <text start="281.44" dur="4.23">in fact her husband&amp;#39;s name is listed the</text>
  <text start="283.72" dur="4.32">very first few verses when you read</text>
  <text start="285.67" dur="5.1">judges for but if you actually take into</text>
  <text start="288.04" dur="4.98">account the things that number did and</text>
  <text start="290.77" dur="5.46">said you&amp;#39;ll discover that Deborah</text>
  <text start="293.02" dur="5.58">actually well she encourages Brock to do</text>
  <text start="296.23" dur="3.63">what he already knew to do what he</text>
  <text start="298.6" dur="3.39">already should have been acting upon but</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="4.41">he wasn&amp;#39;t that yah had already spoken to</text>
  <text start="301.99" dur="4.68">him so Deborah encouraging to do what he</text>
  <text start="304.27" dur="4.59">already knew he should be doing and then</text>
  <text start="306.67" dur="4.29">once they they win the victory Deborah</text>
  <text start="308.86" dur="4.14">then gives a loud proclamation of praise</text>
  <text start="310.96" dur="4.83">and worship no different than what</text>
  <text start="313" dur="4.83">Miriam did when they cross the Red Sea</text>
  <text start="315.79" dur="3.75">and Miriam led everyone in praise and</text>
  <text start="317.83" dur="4.56">worship nothing wrong with a woman doing</text>
  <text start="319.54" dur="5.16">that either but when Paul is talking</text>
  <text start="322.39" dur="3.96">about teaching he&amp;#39;s specifically talking</text>
  <text start="324.7" dur="3.78">about women teaching doctrine</text>
  <text start="326.35" dur="4.2">instructing them in and how to keep the</text>
  <text start="328.48" dur="5.16">Torah how to apply it to their lives how</text>
  <text start="330.55" dur="6.42">to to go this this is a responsibility</text>
  <text start="333.64" dur="8.13">in a role that is strictly relegated to</text>
  <text start="336.97" dur="6.87">the elders or two men because of how sin</text>
  <text start="341.77" dur="5.64">affected the different genders men and</text>
  <text start="343.84" dur="5.79">women it&amp;#39;s not to in any way denigrate</text>
  <text start="347.41" dur="4.5">women it doesn&amp;#39;t somehow make them</text>
  <text start="349.63" dur="4.59">inferior it simply shows that there were</text>
  <text start="351.91" dur="5.28">negative effects of sin on both men and</text>
  <text start="354.22" dur="4.89">women and so Yahweh established very</text>
  <text start="357.19" dur="5.34">very clear parameters and roles for both</text>
  <text start="359.11" dur="5.52">of them to fulfill and this was a very</text>
  <text start="362.53" dur="6.24">clear line that that was not only drawn</text>
  <text start="364.63" dur="6.48">in Torah but apostle shot will emphasize</text>
  <text start="368.77" dur="4.41">and repeat it so I hope this makes this</text>
  <text start="371.11" dur="3.87">issue very very clear i know a lot of</text>
  <text start="373.18" dur="4.65">times it gets very very murky i was even</text>
  <text start="374.98" dur="5.16">in a congregation once where the teacher</text>
  <text start="377.83" dur="4.62">had the audacity to say that well</text>
  <text start="380.14" dur="4.59">clearly apostle paul was wrong here this</text>
  <text start="382.45" dur="5.4">was just his opinion well know that this</text>
  <text start="384.73" dur="5.25">isn&amp;#39;t his opinion when Apostle Paul says</text>
  <text start="387.85" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s as his opinion for instance when he</text>
  <text start="389.98" dur="3.66">talks about some of the things involving</text>
  <text start="392.17" dur="4.14">marriage and divorce and he says this is</text>
  <text start="393.64" dur="4.71">from me and not not Yahweh he makes that</text>
  <text start="396.31" dur="3.85">very clear but we know it&amp;#39;s not his</text>
  <text start="398.35" dur="4.81">opinion in first Timothy to be</text>
  <text start="400.16" dur="5.01">as he expounds directly from torah he</text>
  <text start="403.16" dur="4.44">gives the reasoning behind his statement</text>
  <text start="405.17" dur="5.16">going back to the the first few chapters</text>
  <text start="407.6" dur="6.09">of Genesis and what transpired with Adam</text>
  <text start="410.33" dur="4.59">his wife and hast taught so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="413.69" dur="3.87">very clear that this is not Paul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.92" dur="4.47">opinion and of course we know apostle</text>
  <text start="417.56" dur="4.08">shall was very well-versed in the Torah</text>
  <text start="419.39" dur="5.16">and the prophets and he knew what he was</text>
  <text start="421.64" dur="4.5">talking about so we always need to make</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="3.9">sure that before we assume something</text>
  <text start="426.14" dur="3.84">about what Paul is saying that that we</text>
  <text start="428.45" dur="3.41">make sure our thinking is correct and</text>
  <text start="429.98" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re applying things in the right way</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="5.17">up so i hope this i hope this podcast is</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="4.29">edifying to those that this is designed</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="3.93">for and I pray that you all have a very</text>
  <text start="439.1" dur="3.99">wonderful rest of your week we&amp;#39;ll have a</text>
  <text start="440.96" dur="7.01">very special prophetic podcast coming</text>
  <text start="443.09" dur="4.88">out for shabbat yah bless Shalom</text>
