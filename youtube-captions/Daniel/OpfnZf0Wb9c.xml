  <text start="43.68" dur="5.28">September 21st so I wanted to talk</text>
  <text start="46.11" dur="5.039">something that yah has been laying on my</text>

  <text start="54.329" dur="4.171">this in a way that that he wants me to</text>
  <text start="56.43" dur="6.149">because I I really believe this message</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="7.08">is important if you go to the book of</text>
  <text start="62.579" dur="4.741">Revelation 10 and 11 you read about what</text>
  <text start="65.58" dur="4.44">happens in the days of the seventh</text>
  <text start="67.32" dur="4.53">trumpet of course if you&amp;#39;ve read</text>
  <text start="70.02" dur="5.76">Revelation you know that there are seven</text>
  <text start="71.85" dur="5.85">distinct trumpets that blow in fact the</text>
  <text start="75.78" dur="6.81">entire book of Revelation has seven</text>
  <text start="77.7" dur="6.57">seals and seven trumpets there are seven</text>
  <text start="82.59" dur="5.19">thunders which are a mystery and there</text>
  <text start="84.27" dur="6.3">are seven bowls so you have four sevens</text>
  <text start="87.78" dur="6.089">that that occur throughout of the book</text>
  <text start="90.57" dur="6.089">of Revelation but I want a center on the</text>
  <text start="93.869" dur="4.531">seventh and last trumpet because we are</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="4.651">on the Feast of Trumpets this is yom</text>
  <text start="98.4" dur="5.28">teruah the feast of shouting and</text>
  <text start="101.31" dur="5.309">trumpets and i believe that in fact i</text>
  <text start="103.68" dur="4.799">know that the final and last trumpet the</text>
  <text start="106.619" dur="4.29">seventh trumpet that&amp;#39;s described in</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="4.781">Revelation is directly tied to this day</text>
  <text start="110.909" dur="5.201">yom teruah</text>
  <text start="113.26" dur="8.28">because and and it&amp;#39;s that is actually a</text>
  <text start="116.11" dur="7.17">very simple childlike spirit feel way to</text>
  <text start="121.54" dur="3.48">determine that I mean you don&amp;#39;t need a</text>
  <text start="123.28" dur="3.33">lot of head knowledge if you just go to</text>
  <text start="125.02" dur="3.86">first Corinthians chapter 15</text>
  <text start="126.61" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s where Paul is clearly talking about</text>
  <text start="128.88" dur="3.64">the resurrection of the jess the</text>
  <text start="130.84" dur="4.8">resurrection of the righteous you know</text>
  <text start="132.52" dur="5.7">he he makes reference I mean he says you</text>
  <text start="135.64" dur="4.65">know in the twinkling of an eye at the</text>
  <text start="138.22" dur="4.5">last Trump the Trump and he describes</text>
  <text start="140.29" dur="5.49">the resurrection but he preface is that</text>
  <text start="142.72" dur="6.69">by saying behold I show you a mystery he</text>
  <text start="145.78" dur="6.95">says this is a mystery and you know if</text>
  <text start="149.41" dur="6.96">you go to John&amp;#39;s writing in chapter 10</text>
  <text start="152.73" dur="5.17">verse 7 he says but in the days of the</text>
  <text start="156.37" dur="4.59">voice of the seventh angel when he shall</text>
  <text start="157.9" dur="5.22">begin to sound the trumpet the mystery</text>
  <text start="160.96" dur="3.69">of yah should be finished as he is</text>
  <text start="163.12" dur="3.78">declared as servants the prophets so</text>
  <text start="164.65" dur="5.85">Paul refers to a mystery in 1st</text>
  <text start="166.9" dur="6.69">Corinthians 15 and John refers to that</text>
  <text start="170.5" dur="6">same mystery in in revelation 10 so we</text>
  <text start="173.59" dur="4.74">know that this seventh and last trumpet</text>
  <text start="176.5" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s blown by this seventh angel is</text>
  <text start="178.33" dur="4.71">directly tied to what Paul describes in</text>
  <text start="181.48" dur="3.21">first Corinthians 15 as being the</text>
  <text start="183.04" dur="3.63">mystery in a moment in the twinkling of</text>
  <text start="184.69" dur="4.08">an eye at the last Trump the trumpet</text>
  <text start="186.67" dur="3.539">shall sound and the dead shall be raised</text>
  <text start="188.77" dur="3.66">incorruptible and then we shall all be</text>
  <text start="190.209" dur="3.661">changed again it repeats it in 1st</text>
  <text start="192.43" dur="3.059">Thessalonians 4 the dead and Messiah</text>
  <text start="193.87" dur="3.69">rise first and then we who are alive and</text>
  <text start="195.489" dur="5.271">remain are caught up to be with him in</text>
  <text start="197.56" dur="5.76">the clouds so so we know very clearly</text>
  <text start="200.76" dur="5.65">just through using these soot to civil</text>
  <text start="203.32" dur="5.97">passages that yom teruah the Feast of</text>
  <text start="206.41" dur="4.86">Trumpets is all about this seventh and</text>
  <text start="209.29" dur="5.01">last trumpet about being caught up to be</text>
  <text start="211.27" dur="6.33">with Messiah Yahshua in our resurrected</text>
  <text start="214.3" dur="4.56">bodies this is the mystery that all of</text>
  <text start="217.6" dur="3.54">the Saints have been looking forward</text>
  <text start="218.86" dur="3.99">both in ancient Israel and then post</text>
  <text start="221.14" dur="4.41">resurrection we&amp;#39;ve all been looking</text>
  <text start="222.85" dur="5.34">forward to this day and so I do believe</text>
  <text start="225.55" dur="4.65">that at some future yom teruah obviously</text>
  <text start="228.19" dur="4.38">not this year not not this jubilee year</text>
  <text start="230.2" dur="5.13">but in some future yom teruah we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.57" dur="5.04">gonna see this day fulfilled just as we</text>
  <text start="235.33" dur="4.409">saw passover unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="237.61" dur="3.42">firstfruits and shadow all of those have</text>
  <text start="239.739" dur="2.671">been fulfilled and we see that</text>
  <text start="241.03" dur="4.23">throughout the gospels in the book of</text>
  <text start="242.41" dur="4.52">acts so to this next piece giome true is</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="4.069">going to be fulfilled it hasn&amp;#39;t yet</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="5.1">Ben but it&amp;#39;s going to be fulfilled and</text>
  <text start="249.329" dur="4.321">it&amp;#39;s gonna be fulfilled by that seventh</text>
  <text start="252.03" dur="4.5">angel blowing that seventh and final</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="4.98">Trump you know right there in the midst</text>
  <text start="256.53" dur="3.87">of the Great Tribulation and that</text>
  <text start="258.63" dur="4.77">mystery being fulfilled where the dead</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="4.32">of Messiah rise up from the graves were</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="2.88">the two witnesses you know they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="4.8">dead for three half-days and they rise</text>
  <text start="266.28" dur="4.949">up and there&amp;#39;s an earthquake where we</text>
  <text start="269.52" dur="4.41">who are alive and remain follow those</text>
  <text start="271.229" dur="4.261">dead in messiah and we we then also</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="4.59">transform and rise up and this is a very</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="5.459">public huge thing it causes massive</text>
  <text start="278.52" dur="5.28">earthquakes I mean it says I think over</text>
  <text start="280.949" dur="4.171">7,000 are killed in in Jerusalem I mean</text>
  <text start="283.8" dur="3">this is a few this is not some secret</text>
  <text start="285.12" dur="4.229">pre-trib rapture the Christians teach</text>
  <text start="286.8" dur="4.89">this is a very public woe to the earth</text>
  <text start="289.349" dur="3.961">and and and in fact it&amp;#39;s such a violent</text>
  <text start="291.69" dur="3.15">earthquake and rendering of all these</text>
  <text start="293.31" dur="3.389">graves opening across the earth that</text>
  <text start="294.84" dur="3.69">that people are crying out I mean</text>
  <text start="296.699" dur="3.661">they&amp;#39;re they realize this is not good</text>
  <text start="298.53" dur="4.83">this is a woe to them of course it&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="300.36" dur="5.94">us it&amp;#39;s a glorious day so I do believe</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="5.22">that on this day yom teruah the feasts</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="4.41">of trumpets that that is when this is</text>
  <text start="308.58" dur="3.57">going to be fulfilled that that moment</text>
  <text start="310.71" dur="3.3">that twin cleave and i when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="312.15" dur="3.269">transformed to meet Yahshua in the cloud</text>
  <text start="314.01" dur="3.659">that&amp;#39;s what the Feast of Trumpets is all</text>
  <text start="315.419" dur="4.051">about it&amp;#39;s about this last Trump but</text>
  <text start="317.669" dur="4.62">people have said Daniel you know you</text>
  <text start="319.47" dur="4.41">follow this New Moon conjunction and you</text>
  <text start="322.289" dur="2.701">know we think you have to wait for the</text>
  <text start="323.88" dur="3.81">Crescent because you never know when the</text>
  <text start="324.99" dur="4.799">crescents gonna appear you know and and</text>
  <text start="327.69" dur="4.62">Yahshua says no man knows the day or the</text>
  <text start="329.789" dur="3.991">hour well of course if you know and</text>
  <text start="332.31" dur="2.7">you&amp;#39;ve seen my teachings either even</text>
  <text start="333.78" dur="2.879">recently you know I don&amp;#39;t follow</text>
  <text start="335.01" dur="3.24">Crescent I think that&amp;#39;s a pagan</text>
  <text start="336.659" dur="3.211">Babylonian doctrine and it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="338.25" dur="3.78">conjunction that you know when the new</text>
  <text start="339.87" dur="4.85">moons gonna occur and yah wants us to</text>
  <text start="342.03" dur="5.34">know when the new moon is going to incur</text>
  <text start="344.72" dur="5.56">in fact he says that the wicked don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="347.37" dur="5.16">know but you who are living faithful and</text>
  <text start="350.28" dur="4.08">righteously you do know you know and so</text>
  <text start="352.53" dur="3.15">he wants us to know when this new moon</text>
  <text start="354.36" dur="3.75">conjunct she doesn&amp;#39;t want the confusion</text>
  <text start="355.68" dur="4.41">that surrounds the Crescent so what does</text>
  <text start="358.11" dur="4.02">Yahshua mean when he says no man knows</text>
  <text start="360.09" dur="3.449">the day or the hour well in one context</text>
  <text start="362.13" dur="3.42">of course he&amp;#39;s not even talking about</text>
  <text start="363.539" dur="3.541">his return he&amp;#39;s talking about when the</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="3.359">heavens and earth pass away at the end</text>
  <text start="367.08" dur="3.39">of the Millennial Kingdom but there is</text>
  <text start="368.909" dur="3.57">another account where he really is</text>
  <text start="370.47" dur="3.6">referring to his return he&amp;#39;s referring</text>
  <text start="372.479" dur="3.271">to his return there&amp;#39;s no no way around</text>
  <text start="374.07" dur="3.719">it and he says no man will know the day</text>
  <text start="375.75" dur="4.65">or the hour of his return so how do you</text>
  <text start="377.789" dur="2.85">reconcile this well he reconciled us by</text>
  <text start="380.4" dur="1.889">going</text>
  <text start="380.639" dur="4.921">right there in to Revelation chapter 10</text>
  <text start="382.289" dur="6.03">and it says for in the days notice it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.56" dur="4.77">not day its days plural in the days of</text>
  <text start="388.319" dur="3.481">the voice of the seventh angel this is</text>
  <text start="390.33" dur="2.88">describing the seventh angel that blows</text>
  <text start="391.8" dur="5.04">the seventh trumpet the last trumpet</text>
  <text start="393.21" dur="5.069">when he shall begin the sound the</text>
  <text start="396.84" dur="2.549">mystery of yah should be finished as he</text>
  <text start="398.279" dur="4.531">had declared to his servants the</text>
  <text start="399.389" dur="3.9">prophets okay so the days now wait a</text>
  <text start="402.81" dur="3.3">minute</text>
  <text start="403.289" dur="5.1">if you go to Leviticus 23 yom teruah</text>
  <text start="406.11" dur="4.5">piece of trumpets happens on one day</text>
  <text start="408.389" dur="5.701">it&amp;#39;s the it&amp;#39;s the first day of the</text>
  <text start="410.61" dur="5.25">seventh new moon so one day scripturally</text>
  <text start="414.09" dur="4.049">is you know evening and morning evening</text>
  <text start="415.86" dur="4.29">a more to say you start unto the day in</text>
  <text start="418.139" dur="3.99">the evening and you go to the following</text>
  <text start="420.15" dur="4.56">evening until the next day begin so yom</text>
  <text start="422.129" dur="5.04">sure is one day so so how is it that</text>
  <text start="424.71" dur="6.29">that we have the days of the seventh</text>
  <text start="427.169" dur="5.46">trumpet well the reason why is because</text>
  <text start="431" dur="4.36">yom teruah</text>
  <text start="432.629" dur="5.1">okay the day of the new moon the seventh</text>
  <text start="435.36" dur="4.829">new moon this wonderful feast this is</text>
  <text start="437.729" dur="5.25">the beginning of what&amp;#39;s known as the ten</text>
  <text start="440.189" dur="5.551">Days of Awe so it&amp;#39;s it there we start</text>
  <text start="442.979" dur="4.831">today and then you know today&amp;#39;s day one</text>
  <text start="445.74" dur="3.959">and you go day two day three you have</text>
  <text start="447.81" dur="4.65">ten days and on that tenth day is Yom</text>
  <text start="449.699" dur="5.671">Kippur so this year Yom Kippur happens</text>
  <text start="452.46" dur="5.939">to fall on not not this Shabbat but next</text>
  <text start="455.37" dur="5.009">Shabbat on September 30th which that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.399" dur="3.661">also an interesting thing that Yom</text>
  <text start="460.379" dur="3.331">Kippur falls on the Sabbath day a weekly</text>
  <text start="462.06" dur="3.389">Sabbath but we&amp;#39;ll get to that later</text>
  <text start="463.71" dur="4.669">but any case there&amp;#39;s these 10 days of</text>
  <text start="465.449" dur="4.981">off now you&amp;#39;re not gonna find the</text>
  <text start="468.379" dur="3.28">description of ten Days of Awe anywhere</text>
  <text start="470.43" dur="3.539">in scripture that&amp;#39;s something the Jews</text>
  <text start="471.659" dur="4.29">sort of called it but nevertheless in</text>
  <text start="473.969" dur="3.961">Scripture you can prove this to</text>
  <text start="475.949" dur="4.2">Leviticus 23 there are 10 days there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.93" dur="8.15">day 1 yum Torah and on the tenth day</text>
  <text start="480.149" dur="9.42">count from that point you you have now</text>
  <text start="486.08" dur="4.959">the feast of yom kippur or i guess it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.569" dur="5.241">not really a feast not the way we think</text>
  <text start="491.039" dur="5.97">of it anyway Day of Atonement Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="494.81" dur="3.19">actually that brings up another good</text>
  <text start="497.009" dur="3.84">point feast</text>
  <text start="498" dur="4.639">MOA deem does not mean you have a bunch</text>
  <text start="500.849" dur="3.72">of food as we think of in English</text>
  <text start="502.639" dur="3.851">nothing wrong with having a bunch of</text>
  <text start="504.569" dur="4.5">food on yom teruah and Feast of Trumpets</text>
  <text start="506.49" dur="4.38">and Sukkot and the Shabbat definitely no</text>
  <text start="509.069" dur="4.2">food on Yom Kippur though but that</text>
  <text start="510.87" dur="2.72">actual word feast MOA deem actually is</text>
  <text start="513.269" dur="2.511">not</text>
  <text start="513.59" dur="4.5">it doesn&amp;#39;t have the same meaning as what</text>
  <text start="515.78" dur="5.13">we think of as a feast in in our English</text>
  <text start="518.09" dur="5.1">language it&amp;#39;s more of a holy set apart</text>
  <text start="520.91" dur="5.52">time that Yas called for us to gather</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="4.95">with him and his people but anyway you</text>
  <text start="526.43" dur="4.74">have these 10 days so there are</text>
  <text start="528.14" dur="4.65">literally as this seventh angels blowing</text>
  <text start="531.17" dur="5.28">the seventh trumpet at some point in the</text>
  <text start="532.79" dur="5.52">future it begins you know on that hidden</text>
  <text start="536.45" dur="4.17">moon it begins in the conjunction the</text>
  <text start="538.31" dur="5.67">day of the new moon of yom teruah but it</text>
  <text start="540.62" dur="5.97">goes for 10 days between you know yom</text>
  <text start="543.98" dur="4.86">teruah and yom kippur so these are the</text>
  <text start="546.59" dur="6.06">days which in which this seventh angel</text>
  <text start="548.84" dur="5.73">begins to sound so even though we follow</text>
  <text start="552.65" dur="3.36">the conjunction we know when that new</text>
  <text start="554.57" dur="4.89">moon is at least those who are walking</text>
  <text start="556.01" dur="5.64">in the light we still don&amp;#39;t know the day</text>
  <text start="559.46" dur="4.86">or the hour because this seventh trumpet</text>
  <text start="561.65" dur="4.41">begins to blow okay and it says that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="564.32" dur="4.8">when the mystery is finished so you have</text>
  <text start="566.06" dur="5.1">10 days in which the dead of Messiah are</text>
  <text start="569.12" dur="4.53">rising in which these two witnesses rise</text>
  <text start="571.16" dur="3.78">in which us who are alive and reigning</text>
  <text start="573.65" dur="4.05">get caught you have this 10 day period</text>
  <text start="574.94" dur="4.8">in which we&amp;#39;re caught up which by the</text>
  <text start="577.7" dur="3.93">way this this really prophetic lis if</text>
  <text start="579.74" dur="4.67">you look at this really ties in to the</text>
  <text start="581.63" dur="5.19">10 days of tribulation at Smyrna</text>
  <text start="584.41" dur="3.85">underwent and I think also has a future</text>
  <text start="586.82" dur="2.82">prophetic implication but there&amp;#39;s these</text>
  <text start="588.26" dur="4.29">10 days in which they&amp;#39;re cast under</text>
  <text start="589.64" dur="5.22">tribulation but during this 10 days this</text>
  <text start="592.55" dur="4.08">is when Jana is saving his people and in</text>
  <text start="594.86" dur="3.63">fact it says he has to because if he</text>
  <text start="596.63" dur="4.2">doesn&amp;#39;t know no flesh should be saved</text>
  <text start="598.49" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s how bad it gets by the time we</text>
  <text start="600.83" dur="5.1">finally get to this point so it&amp;#39;s during</text>
  <text start="603.71" dur="3.81">the days of the seventh trumpet and if</text>
  <text start="605.93" dur="3.6">you go Ashley into Revelation you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="607.52" dur="5.42">actually see again what happens at the</text>
  <text start="609.53" dur="6.15">seventh trumpet starting in in verse</text>
  <text start="612.94" dur="4.09">seven you come to the end of the</text>
  <text start="615.68" dur="3.63">testimony of the two witnesses they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="617.03" dur="4.29">been prophesying for 1260 days or three</text>
  <text start="619.31" dur="3.39">half years and it says and when they</text>
  <text start="621.32" dur="2.79">shall have finished their testimony the</text>
  <text start="622.7" dur="2.94">Beast that ascendeth out of the</text>
  <text start="624.11" dur="2.61">bottomless pit shall make war against</text>
  <text start="625.64" dur="3.06">them and shall overcome them and kill</text>
  <text start="626.72" dur="3.18">them and their dead bodies shall lie in</text>
  <text start="628.7" dur="2.55">the street of the great city which</text>
  <text start="629.9" dur="3.45">spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt</text>
  <text start="631.25" dur="4.86">which is where also our Lord was</text>
  <text start="633.35" dur="5.19">crucified so this is Jerusalem and they</text>
  <text start="636.11" dur="4.32">are the people and Kindred&amp;#39;s and tongues</text>
  <text start="638.54" dur="3.9">and nations shall see their dead bodies</text>
  <text start="640.43" dur="3.51">three days and a half and shall not</text>
  <text start="642.44" dur="3.12">suffer their dead bodies to be put in</text>
  <text start="643.94" dur="3.119">graves and they that dwell upon the</text>
  <text start="645.56" dur="3.059">earth shall rejoice over them and make</text>
  <text start="647.059" dur="3.57">Marian she&amp;#39;ll send gifts one to another</text>
  <text start="648.619" dur="4.2">because these two prophets tormented</text>
  <text start="650.629" dur="3.72">them that dwelt on the earth but after</text>
  <text start="652.819" dur="3.93">the three days and a half the spirit of</text>
  <text start="654.349" dur="4.53">life from yot entered into them okay</text>
  <text start="656.749" dur="4.56">this is clue describing at resurrection</text>
  <text start="658.879" dur="4.14">just like in Ezekiel 37 38 and they</text>
  <text start="661.309" dur="3.72">stood upon their feet and great fear</text>
  <text start="663.019" dur="4.47">fell upon them which saw them and they</text>
  <text start="665.029" dur="5.34">heard a great voice from heaven like a</text>
  <text start="667.489" dur="5.24">Trump really saying come up hither and</text>
  <text start="670.369" dur="5.19">they ascended up to heaven in a cloud</text>
  <text start="672.729" dur="5.29">okay so these two witnesses who have</text>
  <text start="675.559" dur="3.99">been killed they rise up their bodies</text>
  <text start="678.019" dur="3">are transformed which is why they can</text>
  <text start="679.549" dur="4.47">lift up into the sky they go into the</text>
  <text start="681.019" dur="5.19">cloud they meet Yahshua and their</text>
  <text start="684.019" dur="4.17">enemies beheld them and that same hour</text>
  <text start="686.209" dur="3.96">was a great earthquake and the tenth</text>
  <text start="688.189" dur="3.42">part of Jerusalem fell and in the</text>
  <text start="690.169" dur="3.9">earthquake were slain of men seven</text>
  <text start="691.609" dur="4.95">thousand and the remnant were frightened</text>
  <text start="694.069" dur="5.61">rough righted and gave glory to the yah</text>
  <text start="696.559" dur="5.13">heaven the second woe is past so this is</text>
  <text start="699.679" dur="4.17">described as a woe and the third woe</text>
  <text start="701.689" dur="3.57">comes quickly so this second woe is the</text>
  <text start="703.849" dur="3.96">resurrection of the jeff&amp;#39;s the first</text>
  <text start="705.259" dur="4.35">resurrection he who has part in the</text>
  <text start="707.809" dur="4.5">first direction first resurrection upon</text>
  <text start="709.609" dur="4.68">him the second death hath no power so</text>
  <text start="712.309" dur="4.8">this is the seventh and last Trump this</text>
  <text start="714.289" dur="4.65">is I mean it clearly describes what Paul</text>
  <text start="717.109" dur="4.29">describes in 1st Thessalonians 4 that</text>
  <text start="718.939" dur="3.81">the dead of Messiah rise first these two</text>
  <text start="721.399" dur="3.63">witnesses will be part of the dead in</text>
  <text start="722.749" dur="3.74">messiah the dead in messiah rise first</text>
  <text start="725.029" dur="3.39">and then they who are alive and remain</text>
  <text start="726.489" dur="3.52">will be caught up to be with them so</text>
  <text start="728.419" dur="4.32">this is the resurrection this is the</text>
  <text start="730.009" dur="6.03">seventh Trump in the in toward the end</text>
  <text start="732.739" dur="6.06">of the Great Tribulation so so these</text>
  <text start="736.039" dur="5.13">days of the seventh Trump between</text>
  <text start="738.799" dur="4.23">yom teruah and yom kippur these are the</text>
  <text start="741.169" dur="5.07">days in which the seventh trumpet of the</text>
  <text start="743.029" dur="5.37">sound and which these events occur so we</text>
  <text start="746.239" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t really know the day or the hour we</text>
  <text start="748.399" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t really know now what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="750.499" dur="4.95">is that these two witnesses they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="752.599" dur="6.24">gonna prophesy and testify for 1260 days</text>
  <text start="755.449" dur="5.67">so those who are discerning and and and</text>
  <text start="758.839" dur="4.59">are looking and paying attention the</text>
  <text start="761.119" dur="4.32">moment they start you count 1260 days</text>
  <text start="763.429" dur="4.5">and then you have that three and a half</text>
  <text start="765.439" dur="4.65">day period well the scripture silent on</text>
  <text start="767.929" dur="5.7">is that through an F day period included</text>
  <text start="770.089" dur="5.67">in the 1260 or is it beyond the 1260 C</text>
  <text start="773.629" dur="4.98">you don&amp;#39;t know so again you still don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="775.759" dur="3.811">know the day or the hour you see so yah</text>
  <text start="778.609" dur="4.201">is purposely</text>

  <text start="782.81" dur="3.48">gonna come as a thief and the night upon</text>
  <text start="784.52" dur="4.02">the wicked but the righteous will know</text>

  <text start="908.06" dur="4.17">these rewards</text>
  <text start="909.14" dur="3.3">that&amp;#39;s what Yom Kippur is about and it</text>
  <text start="912.23" dur="1.89">all</text>
  <text start="912.44" dur="3.21">of course points toward the great white</text>

  <text start="962.72" dur="4.62">1000 year reign so you know I think this</text>
  <text start="965.75" dur="3.96">is very important to understand that</text>
