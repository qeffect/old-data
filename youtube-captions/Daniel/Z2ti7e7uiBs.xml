  <text start="0.319" dur="4.96">shabbat shalom and this is Daniel John</text>
  <text start="2.879" dur="7.351">Lee with Torah restoration ministries it</text>
  <text start="5.279" dur="7.381">is the Sabbath day November the 4th 2016</text>
  <text start="10.23" dur="5.54">so shabbat shalom&amp;#39; to everyone out there</text>
  <text start="12.66" dur="5.34">I wanted to talk about the rise or</text>
  <text start="15.77" dur="6.73">dangers of dominionism and how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="18" dur="7.41">connected to Donald Trump I of course</text>
  <text start="22.5" dur="4.8">have talked a lot about trumps potential</text>
  <text start="25.41" dur="3.48">presidency and we&amp;#39;ll see in a few days</text>
  <text start="27.3" dur="5.73">if he winds up getting elected or not</text>
  <text start="28.89" dur="7.02">but if he does I definitely see how his</text>
  <text start="33.03" dur="5.22">election and his presidency is going to</text>
  <text start="35.91" dur="4.26">allow the rise of the Dominion theology</text>
  <text start="38.25" dur="5.55">stand the reason I say that is because</text>
  <text start="40.17" dur="6.45">and this is not a criticism of Donald</text>
  <text start="43.8" dur="4.59">Trump so much as it is more of the type</text>
  <text start="46.62" dur="5.04">of Christians and evangelicals that are</text>
  <text start="48.39" dur="5.97">flocking around Trump I&amp;#39;ve watched this</text>
  <text start="51.66" dur="6.03">guy named Lance wall now he&amp;#39;s written</text>
  <text start="54.36" dur="5.58">this book called Trump Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="57.69" dur="6.6">God&amp;#39;s chaos Canada the unraveling of</text>
  <text start="59.94" dur="7.289">America and Lance wall know is someone</text>
  <text start="64.29" dur="4.829">who like many Pentecostal Christians out</text>
  <text start="67.229" dur="3.691">there and Christians of different</text>
  <text start="69.119" dur="3.451">stripes believes in this Dominion</text>
  <text start="70.92" dur="3.96">theology and what Dominion theology is</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="5.549">basically in a very simplistic nutshell</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="5.46">is the belief that the Christian Church</text>
  <text start="78.119" dur="4.771">is going to take over the world for</text>
  <text start="80.34" dur="5.099">Christ and once the Christian Church</text>
  <text start="82.89" dur="3.96">takes over the world for Christ takes</text>
  <text start="85.439" dur="6.68">over the nation for Christ and all the</text>
  <text start="86.85" dur="8.159">nations then Christ will return I</text>
  <text start="92.119" dur="4.121">actually listened Yod spoke to me and</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="2.79">said I want you to watch this interview</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="3.96">and I listened to this interview that</text>
  <text start="97.799" dur="4.71">Lance wall now had with this lady named</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="4.199">Patricia King listen to this last night</text>
  <text start="102.509" dur="3.871">as he was discussing his book about</text>
  <text start="104.399" dur="3.781">Donald Trump and you know Lance&amp;#39;s were</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="3.39">excited about Donald Trump and him being</text>
  <text start="108.18" dur="3.119">a wrecking ball to political correctness</text>
  <text start="109.77" dur="3.36">like a lot of us are excited you know</text>
  <text start="111.299" dur="4.741">some something that we need in this</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="5.07">nation but what happens is these</text>
  <text start="116.04" dur="4.829">Dominion theology take it in a very</text>
  <text start="118.2" dur="5.129">different direction so what they see is</text>
  <text start="120.869" dur="4.71">they see Trump being this wrecking ball</text>
  <text start="123.329" dur="4.981">to political correctness and paving the</text>
  <text start="125.579" dur="4.68">way for these Dominion theologies to</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="6.33">start taking over the nation</text>
  <text start="130.259" dur="9.511">for Christ&amp;#39;s so in this picture here you</text>
  <text start="134.64" dur="7.05">kind of see what what is a central</text>
  <text start="139.77" dur="4.07">belief to the Dominion theology and that</text>
  <text start="141.69" dur="5.85">is you see these seven mountains here</text>
  <text start="143.84" dur="7.06">and the seven mountains typify seven</text>
  <text start="147.54" dur="5.88">different spheres that these Christians</text>
  <text start="150.9" dur="5.43">believe that they have to take over and</text>
  <text start="153.42" dur="4.35">reclaim from Satan now of course this is</text>
  <text start="156.33" dur="3.6">completely departing from the basic</text>
  <text start="157.77" dur="4.23">gospel message of repent of your sin and</text>
  <text start="159.93" dur="4.44">turn to the Messiah and obey his word</text>
  <text start="162" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the Gospel message right</text>
  <text start="164.37" dur="3.39">repent of your sin be covered by the</text>
  <text start="166.38" dur="4.02">blood of Yahshua be filled with the</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="4.23">spirit and obey his word fear God keep</text>
  <text start="170.4" dur="5.97">his Commandments that&amp;#39;s the basic the</text>
  <text start="171.99" dur="6.27">basic tenets of the gospel is what we</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="4.98">should be teaching others and preaching</text>
  <text start="178.26" dur="4.89">and what we should be living but here we</text>
  <text start="181.35" dur="3.15">see that no no no that&amp;#39;s not enough</text>
  <text start="183.15" dur="3.03">we&amp;#39;ve got to go into all these different</text>
  <text start="184.5" dur="2.61">spheres we&amp;#39;ve got to reclaim these</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="2.82">spheres for Christ</text>
  <text start="187.11" dur="4.34">even though Yahshua very clearly said</text>
  <text start="189" dur="4.5">that his kingdom was not of this world</text>
  <text start="191.45" dur="3.85">it&amp;#39;s interesting that there&amp;#39;s seven</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="3.57">mountains here because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="195.3" dur="4.37">scripture in the book of Revelation</text>
  <text start="197.07" dur="5.1">where it also describes seven mountains</text>
  <text start="199.67" dur="5.26">and in fact it describes the beast</text>
  <text start="202.17" dur="5.52">having seven heads and ten horns and the</text>
  <text start="204.93" dur="5.339">whore is sitting on the Beast and in</text>
  <text start="207.69" dur="5.549">Revelation chapter 17 when it is</text>
  <text start="210.269" dur="4.351">interpreting what these symbols mean it</text>
  <text start="213.239" dur="3.991">says and here is the mind which has</text>
  <text start="214.62" dur="4.47">wisdom ziz revelation 17 verse 9 the</text>
  <text start="217.23" dur="5.07">seven heads are seven mountains on which</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="4.74">the whore sits so it&amp;#39;s interesting that</text>
  <text start="222.3" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re trying to reclaim these seven</text>
  <text start="223.83" dur="3">mountains seven spheres and the</text>
  <text start="225.45" dur="4.069">scripture does talk about seven</text>
  <text start="226.83" dur="7.49">mountains that the whore will sit upon</text>
  <text start="229.519" dur="8.071">so really what Dominion theology is is</text>
  <text start="234.32" dur="6.93">aiming toward is this right here</text>
  <text start="237.59" dur="7.39">complete and total Antichrist</text>
  <text start="241.25" dur="6.7">totalitarianism it&amp;#39;s the vehicle in</text>
  <text start="244.98" dur="7.62">which Satan will use to enthrone his man</text>
  <text start="247.95" dur="9.08">the Antichrist by causing these anti</text>
  <text start="252.6" dur="7.35">Torah Dominion theology Christians to</text>
  <text start="257.03" dur="5.35">take over the world and enthroned</text>
  <text start="259.95" dur="4.29">this New Age Christ that of course will</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="3.87">be completely tore or less and quickly</text>
  <text start="264.24" dur="7.35">divorced from any Jewish Hebrew roots</text>
  <text start="266.25" dur="8.58">whatsoever it&amp;#39;s going to be hell on</text>
  <text start="271.59" dur="5.04">earth and in fact we read when Messiah</text>
  <text start="274.83" dur="2.76">talks about he says you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="276.63" dur="2.79">gonna come a point where they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="4.77">persecute the believers and think that</text>
  <text start="279.42" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re doing God a service Isaiah also</text>
  <text start="282.36" dur="7.23">talks about this in the last chapter of</text>
  <text start="284.34" dur="7.74">Isaiah Isaiah 66 and in verse 5 he says</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="4.86">hear the word of Yahweh you that tremble</text>
  <text start="292.08" dur="4.14">at his word your brethren that hated you</text>
  <text start="294.45" dur="4.26">that cast you out for my name&amp;#39;s sake</text>
  <text start="296.22" dur="4.77">saying let the Lord be glorified but he</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="2.91">shall appear to your joy and they shall</text>
  <text start="300.99" dur="3.66">be ashamed</text>
  <text start="301.62" dur="5.07">so these Dominion theologies truly are</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="5.25">going to believe that they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="306.69" dur="5.16">work of yah that they&amp;#39;re that they are</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="3.99">doing the work of the Lord and that they</text>
  <text start="311.85" dur="4.14">are establishing the kingdom of God on</text>
  <text start="313.89" dur="4.29">earth but in fact they&amp;#39;re actually going</text>
  <text start="315.99" dur="5.79">to be establishing a very oppressive</text>
  <text start="318.18" dur="6.63">regime that will destroy anyone that</text>
  <text start="321.78" dur="4.62">dares just say excuse me this person</text>
  <text start="324.81" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s ruling the world this is not the</text>
  <text start="326.4" dur="4.59">new this is not Messiah this is some</text>
  <text start="329.22" dur="3.66">sort of devil it&amp;#39;s a new age Christ and</text>
  <text start="330.99" dur="3.72">of course then the Dominion of</text>
  <text start="332.88" dur="5.55">Christians will be like you&amp;#39;ll off with</text>
  <text start="334.71" dur="5.67">their heads again this is not anything</text>
  <text start="338.43" dur="3.72">I&amp;#39;m not pointing this toward Donald</text>
  <text start="340.38" dur="4.98">Trump per say I&amp;#39;m just saying that the</text>
  <text start="342.15" dur="6.27">type of Christians that are beginning to</text>
  <text start="345.36" dur="6.54">flock around Trump and beginning to what</text>
  <text start="348.42" dur="5.01">they see what they see prophetically as</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="3.3">the door opening for what they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="353.43" dur="4.68">be able to accomplish under Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="355.2" dur="4.74">administration that&amp;#39;s what this video is</text>
  <text start="358.11" dur="2.91">about in fact I&amp;#39;m hoping I&amp;#39;m gonna be</text>
  <text start="359.94" dur="3.09">over the next few weeks I&amp;#39;m gonna be</text>
  <text start="361.02" dur="4.62">working on this article a much more</text>
  <text start="363.03" dur="4.95">researched well researched article I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="365.64" dur="4.2">talking about all these concepts but I</text>
  <text start="367.98" dur="3.24">just wanted to make a video about this</text>
  <text start="369.84" dur="3.33">especially this were on the brink of the</text>
  <text start="371.22" dur="5.04">election we&amp;#39;re about to find out who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.17" dur="7.83">gonna win this election I could</text>
  <text start="376.26" dur="7.5">definitely see that if Trump does win it</text>
  <text start="381" dur="6.15">would definitely open the door to some</text>
  <text start="383.76" dur="5.64">very serious prophetic things coming</text>
  <text start="387.15" dur="4.17">down the pike things that I&amp;#39;m not scared</text>
  <text start="389.4" dur="3.4">about because quite frankly these are</text>
  <text start="391.32" dur="4.57">things that have to</text>
  <text start="392.8" dur="6.33">you know this delusion has to happen in</text>
  <text start="395.89" dur="5.07">order for the Messiah to return so if</text>
  <text start="399.13" dur="3.84">the Dominion theology star using the</text>
  <text start="400.96" dur="4.02">occasion of the trump presidency to</text>
  <text start="402.97" dur="5.61">bring about what they&amp;#39;re wanting to to</text>
  <text start="404.98" dur="5.49">see on the earth then that must be God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.58" dur="3.93">way of bringing this delusion that will</text>
  <text start="410.47" dur="4.26">eventually cover the earth during the</text>
  <text start="412.51" dur="4.62">Great Tribulation so we&amp;#39;ll see how this</text>
  <text start="414.73" dur="4.29">all pans out but I just wanted to make a</text>
  <text start="417.13" dur="2.61">brief video about this and put my</text>
