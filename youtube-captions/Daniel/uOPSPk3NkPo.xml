  <text start="13.94" dur="6.669">will be 220 feet below the surface and</text>
  <text start="17.94" dur="4.95">this is also a very unique room to our</text>
  <text start="20.609" dur="5.221">cave because it has all three major</text>
  <text start="22.89" dur="4.62">types of rock in it so when you want to</text>
  <text start="25.83" dur="5.75">remember back in maybe fifth-grade</text>
  <text start="27.51" dur="4.07">science what the three types of luck our</text>
  <text start="32.719" dur="6.52">baby is not only work doin up there you</text>
  <text start="36.36" dur="4.199">go so it is man perfect sedimentary all</text>
  <text start="39.239" dur="2.761">three of those rocks you&amp;#39;re found in</text>
  <text start="40.559" dur="3.991">this very room it makes our cave</text>
  <text start="42" dur="6">extremely unique most caves don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="44.55" dur="5.55">all those rocks toppers so um we have</text>
  <text start="48" dur="3.93">metamorphic rocks we&amp;#39;ve already talked</text>
  <text start="50.1" dur="3.66">about it it&amp;#39;s not rocket goes through</text>
  <text start="51.93" dur="4.14">heat and pressure to become what it is</text>
  <text start="53.76" dur="3.689">so our marvelous considered metamorphic</text>
  <text start="56.07" dur="3.75">all of the walls in here would be</text>
  <text start="57.449" dur="4.531">metamorphic and then sedimentary rock is</text>
  <text start="59.82" dur="4.14">anything that forms in layers on top of</text>
  <text start="61.98" dur="4.2">each other so all of the calcite</text>
  <text start="63.96" dur="4.05">formations all of our slag types slag</text>
  <text start="66.18" dur="4.08">mites those are considered sedimentary</text>
  <text start="68.01" dur="4.14">because as they drip they leave behind</text>
  <text start="70.26" dur="4.679">the calcite minerals and layers on top</text>
  <text start="72.15" dur="4.649">of each other and then lastly is igneous</text>
  <text start="74.939" dur="4.47">I haven&amp;#39;t really talked about it yet but</text>
  <text start="76.799" dur="5.401">it does form from the cooling of lapa or</text>
  <text start="79.409" dur="5.041">magma so in this case it was magma about</text>
  <text start="82.2" dur="4.77">two are about 65 million years ago</text>
  <text start="84.45" dur="4.44">beneath our feet was a very large body</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="4.8">of matter called a pluton it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="88.89" dur="4.64">big chamber of magma and it continues to</text>
  <text start="91.77" dur="4.01">be filled by vodka from the</text>
  <text start="93.53" dur="6.269">and so it&amp;#39;ll start to bulge a little bit</text>
  <text start="95.78" dur="6.42">it it hits compact he doesn&amp;#39;t say and it</text>
  <text start="99.799" dur="4.5">starts to bulb push outward it will then</text>
  <text start="102.2" dur="3.72">push up on the rock above it at the time</text>
  <text start="104.299" dur="3.93">the rock above it was made up of our</text>
  <text start="105.92" dur="4.53">marble so it pushed up on the Marvel</text>
  <text start="108.229" dur="4.14">cracked the marble apart and then so</text>
  <text start="110.45" dur="4.35">much pressure was behind that magma that</text>
  <text start="112.369" dur="5.43">the magma pushed up into the cracks and</text>
  <text start="114.8" dur="5.19">cooled in the crack so we have a craft</text>
  <text start="117.799" dur="6.091">that has filled with magma and cooled in</text>
  <text start="119.99" dur="5.7">this very room yeah you can call it all</text>
  <text start="123.89" dur="3.63">the way across around you guys notice</text>
  <text start="125.69" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s a darker color from the marble</text>
  <text start="127.52" dur="4.23">surrounding it it&amp;#39;s also formed</text>
  <text start="129.47" dur="3.69">differently because I just explained so</text>
  <text start="131.75" dur="3.63">it does have very different</text>
  <text start="133.16" dur="3.87">characteristics from the marble the</text>
  <text start="135.38" dur="3.03">marble you&amp;#39;ve seen all over the place</text>
  <text start="137.03" dur="3.239">the water can see right through it</text>
  <text start="138.41" dur="6.38">whereas it doesn&amp;#39;t pass through this</text>
  <text start="140.269" dur="4.521">rock as easily so what we find is that</text>
