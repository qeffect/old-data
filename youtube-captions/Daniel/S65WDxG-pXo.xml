  <text start="2.05" dur="5.16">hallelujah shabbat shalom my Sabbath</text>
  <text start="5.68" dur="4.76">hike has kind of turned into a Sabbath</text>
  <text start="7.21" dur="3.23">Drive because it is</text>
  <text start="12.08" dur="8.82">16:15 is 15 degrees outside</text>
  <text start="16.4" dur="7.4">three cold I like the cold but</text>
  <text start="20.9" dur="2.9">that&amp;#39;s pretty forward</text>
  <text start="24.26" dur="4.04">so I&amp;#39;m taking a Sabbath Drive</text>
  <text start="31" dur="3.96">I wanted to talk about our prayer</text>
  <text start="33.61" dur="3.51">meetings that we&amp;#39;re having every night</text>
  <text start="34.96" dur="5.16">we meet nightly and the reason we meet</text>
  <text start="37.12" dur="4.47">nightly every single day is because in</text>
  <text start="40.12" dur="4.2">the book of Acts it talks about how the</text>
  <text start="41.59" dur="5.37">first century believers they met daily</text>
  <text start="44.32" dur="5.2">in their homes raking bread encouraging</text>
  <text start="46.96" dur="5.44">one another and yeah</text>
  <text start="49.52" dur="5.73">and many of the people who have decided</text>
  <text start="52.4" dur="5.4">to meet every single night they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="55.25" dur="4.65">noticed that their prayer life has</text>
  <text start="57.8" dur="3.96">dramatically improved their</text>
  <text start="59.9" dur="3.48">circumstances and their life has</text>
  <text start="61.76" dur="4.08">dramatically improved they&amp;#39;ve received</text>
  <text start="63.38" dur="3.98">blessings that that they had never</text>
  <text start="65.84" dur="3.92">gotten before</text>
  <text start="67.36" dur="6.56">and and there&amp;#39;s a reason why the first</text>
  <text start="69.76" dur="6.77">century believers met every single day</text>
  <text start="73.92" dur="4.32">now I don&amp;#39;t need I mean yesterday John</text>
  <text start="76.53" dur="3.84">and I noticed we had 20 people that join</text>
  <text start="78.24" dur="4.53">the room I don&amp;#39;t need anymore I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="80.37" dur="5.609">want to have a big group of fact Yahshua</text>
  <text start="82.77" dur="6.06">Jesus you know he had 12 he disciple 12</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="4.951">and and that was the big enough group</text>
  <text start="88.83" dur="3.529">for him there were only 120 in the upper</text>
  <text start="90.93" dur="3.35">room</text>
  <text start="92.359" dur="3.69">and then if you look in the book of Acts</text>
  <text start="94.28" dur="3.21">you know they these were small little</text>
  <text start="96.049" dur="4.5">congregations they would meet in their</text>
  <text start="97.49" dur="5.22">homes even Antioch it was small meeting</text>
  <text start="100.549" dur="3.75">in people&amp;#39;s homes and then you know</text>
  <text start="102.71" dur="2.64">they&amp;#39;d go to synagogue on Shabbat where</text>
  <text start="104.299" dur="2.971">you have a little bit bigger but still</text>
  <text start="105.35" dur="5.189">very small the only really big meetings</text>
  <text start="107.27" dur="6.11">were the annual feast days like Passover</text>
  <text start="110.539" dur="6.211">and Sukkot Hanukah they go to the temple</text>
  <text start="113.38" dur="5.079">but I don&amp;#39;t really need a big prayer</text>
  <text start="116.75" dur="4.02">meeting I think my limit is only a</text>
  <text start="118.459" dur="4.41">hundred people on zoom&amp;#39; anyway but I</text>
  <text start="120.77" dur="4.2">encourage you to start your own little</text>
  <text start="122.869" dur="3.661">small groups whether it&amp;#39;s on zoom&amp;#39;</text>
  <text start="124.97" dur="5.269">whether it&amp;#39;s actually people in your</text>
  <text start="126.53" dur="7.41">home and and start meeting every night</text>
  <text start="130.239" dur="10.11">you know we have a very the police we</text>
  <text start="133.94" dur="6.409">have a very a very</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="4.93">simple way of doing things we just</text>
  <text start="142.77" dur="5.22">basically pray</text>
  <text start="145.63" dur="2.36">and</text>
  <text start="149.26" dur="5.24">we do praise and worship Wow look at</text>
  <text start="151.39" dur="3.11">that look at the glacier today</text>
  <text start="155.55" dur="5.46">and we</text>
  <text start="158.459" dur="4.441">I open it up for people to share if</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="3.209">anyone has a word a prophecy a song</text>
  <text start="162.9" dur="3.839">scripture just like they did in the</text>
  <text start="164.219" dur="4.231">first century it&amp;#39;s very simple to what</text>
  <text start="166.739" dur="3.391">we do we usually mean perfect by a</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="3.93">couple hours</text>
  <text start="170.13" dur="5.25">but you can start your own group you</text>
  <text start="172.38" dur="4.77">know of course anyone can join mine I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="175.38" dur="4.32">not telling people they can&amp;#39;t draw mine</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="5.69">but but I want people to be doing this</text>
  <text start="179.7" dur="3.14">all across the country</text>
  <text start="183.17" dur="5.36">because I better not show that confident</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="3.44">tell me while I&amp;#39;m driving</text>
  <text start="192.16" dur="4.51">Scripture</text>
  <text start="194.069" dur="2.601">but</text>
  <text start="200.079" dur="4.66">but it&amp;#39;s very important I think to be</text>
  <text start="202.489" dur="3.72">meaning every day like this they</text>
  <text start="204.739" dur="3.511">encourage each other especially in the</text>
  <text start="206.209" dur="3.87">days that we&amp;#39;re living in you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.25" dur="3.629">in a spiritual battle a spiritual war</text>
  <text start="210.079" dur="3.231">even though I have a lot of victory in</text>
  <text start="211.879" dur="3.871">my spirit with what&amp;#39;s happening with</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="5.319">President Trump I do believe that all</text>
  <text start="215.75" dur="4.349">these horrible and fantasise abortion</text>
  <text start="218.629" dur="4.411">laws that are being pushed are basically</text>
  <text start="220.099" dur="4.95">to push things through the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="223.04" dur="4.529">to completely overturn roe v wade and</text>
  <text start="225.049" dur="6.06">stop this horrible murdering of our</text>
  <text start="227.569" dur="5.561">babies I was just talking to my friends</text>
  <text start="231.109" dur="3.731">up in Anchorage and</text>
  <text start="233.13" dur="4.41">Tamia was sharing with me she said you</text>
  <text start="234.84" dur="5.16">know even when she was growing up they</text>
  <text start="237.54" dur="4.949">had a horrible thing happened where the</text>
  <text start="240" dur="6.569">grandfather raped a</text>
  <text start="242.489" dur="5.761">a family member of hers but but but they</text>
  <text start="246.569" dur="3.9">are still born the guys they still look</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="4.349">the first to be born and he has a</text>
  <text start="250.469" dur="4.561">wonderful life now now of course it was</text>
  <text start="252.599" dur="4.26">horrible what the grandfather did but</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="3.06">that doesn&amp;#39;t that you know one evil</text>
  <text start="256.859" dur="2.581">doesn&amp;#39;t say that we should then do</text>
  <text start="258.09" dur="2.85">another evil to murder so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="259.44" dur="6.599">believe abortion should ever be</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="6.84">permissible in any case and when they</text>
  <text start="266.039" dur="3.391">say the life of the mother is endangered</text>
  <text start="267.78" dur="3.69">give me a break that&amp;#39;s like less than</text>
  <text start="269.43" dur="4.53">point zero zero zero one percent and</text>
  <text start="271.47" dur="4.83">even then all efforts should be made to</text>
  <text start="273.96" dur="3.72">save the child and the baby side I never</text>
  <text start="276.3" dur="4.23">believe abortion is permissible</text>
  <text start="277.68" dur="3.39">permissible under any circumstances it</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="3.74">is murder</text>
  <text start="281.07" dur="5.099">there is a heartbeat at twenty two days</text>
  <text start="284.27" dur="4.69">twenty two days old</text>
  <text start="286.169" dur="4.711">the baby has a heartbeat so you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="288.96" dur="5.25">ever tell me that this baby doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="290.88" dur="5.13">a life from the very from the moment of</text>
  <text start="294.21" dur="3.21">conception</text>
  <text start="296.01" dur="3.51">when I believe all that&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="297.42" dur="3.06">overturned so we are living in wonderful</text>
  <text start="299.52" dur="2.85">times that we still need to be</text>
  <text start="300.48" dur="3.96">encouraging each other and I was sharing</text>
  <text start="302.37" dur="4.2">with my prayer team this was a couple</text>
  <text start="304.44" dur="4.38">nights ago but I said you know those who</text>
  <text start="306.57" dur="3.63">are pressing in and who are meeting</text>
  <text start="308.82" dur="3.03">every night with other brothers and</text>
  <text start="310.2" dur="3.78">sisters in Christ they&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="311.85" dur="3.45">these blessings and those who are not</text>
  <text start="313.98" dur="2.88">you&amp;#39;re not going to get the blessings</text>
  <text start="315.3" dur="3.69">and that&amp;#39;s going to separate and so</text>
  <text start="316.86" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;ll hopefully wake more people up in</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="2.88">the church to say you know I need to</text>
  <text start="320.28" dur="3.66">find my own fellowship where I&amp;#39;m meeting</text>
  <text start="321.87" dur="3.81">every single day and you can just you</text>
  <text start="323.94" dur="3.69">know form a small little prayer group in</text>
  <text start="325.68" dur="4.56">your local area or you can start your</text>
  <text start="327.63" dur="4.11">own little zoom group I only pay I think</text>
  <text start="330.24" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s like 15 bucks a month and that</text>
  <text start="331.74" dur="4.05">allows me to host up to 100 people so</text>
  <text start="334.32" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s very affordable to host your own</text>
  <text start="335.79" dur="4.5">zoom meeting you have the technology to</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="3.96">do that or just start advertising your</text>
