  <text start="253.8" dur="3.24">of the earth and will come up to keep</text>
  <text start="255.69" dur="4.37">the feasts of suit coat each year and if</text>

  <text start="260.06" dur="5.829">crippled with drought it says the Ox</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="5.13">will eat</text>
  <text start="265.889" dur="5.821">rass like the excuse me the lion will</text>
  <text start="269.34" dur="4.74">eat the grass like the Ox says the lamb</text>
  <text start="271.71" dur="3.989">and the lion and the bear will all lay</text>
  <text start="274.08" dur="3.419">down together and a child would lead</text>
  <text start="275.699" dur="4.231">them says children will be playing in</text>
  <text start="277.499" dur="3.991">the holes of the ASP so snakes will no</text>
  <text start="279.93" dur="4.68">longer be venomous animals will be</text>
  <text start="281.49" dur="6.479">restored back to their kind gentle eden</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="4.919">nature and their vegetarian mode so a</text>
  <text start="287.969" dur="3.42">good deal of eden is going to be</text>
  <text start="289.529" dur="3.241">restored during this time now for my</text>
  <text start="291.389" dur="3">study in scriptures and i could be wrong</text>
  <text start="292.77" dur="3.63">about this but for my study in</text>
  <text start="294.389" dur="3.84">scriptures it seems that the land of</text>
  <text start="296.4" dur="4.769">israel mountains I in the Land of Israel</text>
  <text start="298.229" dur="6.15">from the River Nile to the Euphrates</text>
  <text start="301.169" dur="5.31">will be restored to its Eden Garden</text>
  <text start="304.379" dur="4.56">perfect paradise worm the rest of the</text>
  <text start="306.479" dur="3.87">earth however I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure it</text>
  <text start="308.939" dur="3.51">seems like there still will be summer in</text>
  <text start="310.349" dur="3.66">winter there still will be sin on the</text>
  <text start="312.449" dur="2.911">earth because it says that Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="314.009" dur="4.02">going to rule with a rod of iron to</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="4.169">punish sin quickly and that those</text>
  <text start="318.029" dur="4.23">nations who refuse to come up will</text>
  <text start="319.529" dur="4.021">receive crippling drought but it does</text>
  <text start="322.259" dur="3.451">say that there are living waters that</text>
  <text start="323.55" dur="6.589">will gush forth from Jerusalem to the</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="6.84">Mediterranean and to the Red Sea and</text>
  <text start="330.139" dur="6.4">these waters will be living waters that</text>
  <text start="332.55" dur="6.419">will be for healing and there will still</text>
  <text start="336.539" dur="3.78">be people mortal people who live and die</text>
  <text start="338.969" dur="2.94">although it says they&amp;#39;ll live much</text>
  <text start="340.319" dur="5.491">longer because there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="341.909" dur="5.25">restored to its you know former self so</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="2.849">it says someone who dies that 100 years</text>
  <text start="347.159" dur="4.081">of age will be considered a child or</text>
  <text start="348.659" dur="4.68">young but it&amp;#39;ll be a thousand-year Satan</text>
  <text start="351.24" dur="3.81">will be bound into the abyss the pit so</text>
  <text start="353.339" dur="4.741">he won&amp;#39;t be around to tempting people or</text>
  <text start="355.05" dur="6.209">causing people to sin and so this is</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="4.98">that thousand year period and that</text>
  <text start="361.259" dur="3.93">thousand year period is going to be a</text>
  <text start="363.06" dur="4.65">wonderful time or Messiah will be ruling</text>
  <text start="365.189" dur="4.65">where Torah will be honored and observes</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="3.66">for those of us who love Tim will be</text>
  <text start="369.839" dur="3.901">resurrected and ruling and reigning with</text>
  <text start="371.37" dur="4.319">him and instructing the nations of the</text>
  <text start="373.74" dur="5.28">earth and how to love Yahshua and how to</text>
  <text start="375.689" dur="4.95">obey him keep his precepts and then at</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="5.79">some point after that one thousand years</text>
  <text start="380.639" dur="7.77">is over Satan is released from his pit</text>
  <text start="384.81" dur="5.159">in order to deceive people and those who</text>
  <text start="388.409" dur="3.78">have not truly yielded themselves up to</text>
  <text start="389.969" dur="3.961">Messiah will be deceived by him not us</text>
  <text start="392.189" dur="3.63">not those who are resurrected will be</text>
  <text start="393.93" dur="3.75">with him in the camp of the Saints but</text>
  <text start="395.819" dur="2.571">the mortals who are still alive during</text>
  <text start="397.68" dur="3.98">that time</text>
  <text start="398.39" dur="6.36">there won&amp;#39;t be any war no disease no</text>
  <text start="401.66" dur="7.26">famine there won&amp;#39;t be any again</text>
  <text start="404.75" dur="5.91">temptation to sin from the devil none of</text>
  <text start="408.92" dur="3.24">that will happen and so you realize that</text>
  <text start="410.66" dur="3.29">people the mortals who survived the</text>
  <text start="412.16" dur="4.05">tribulation they&amp;#39;ll be having babies and</text>
  <text start="413.95" dur="3.94">thousand years of no war no disease</text>
  <text start="416.21" dur="3.84">thousand years of peace that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="417.89" dur="4.32">probably lead to a pretty huge global</text>
  <text start="420.05" dur="6.42">population by the end of the thousand</text>
  <text start="422.21" dur="5.76">years and so anyway that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.47" dur="2.64">the description of the 10 canyon from</text>
  <text start="427.97" dur="2.49">scriptures and i&amp;#39;m pulling from a</text>
  <text start="429.11" dur="3.39">variety of different scriptures from</text>
  <text start="430.46" dur="3.87">isaiah and things like that but just</text>
  <text start="432.5" dur="4.2">trying to paint a picture of what the</text>
  <text start="434.33" dur="3.75">millennial kingdom is going to be so i</text>
  <text start="436.7" dur="3.66">hope that kind of gives you a vivid</text>
  <text start="438.08" dur="3.96">sense and encourages you to search the</text>
  <text start="440.36" dur="3.33">Scriptures yourself and to read and</text>
  <text start="442.04" dur="3.9">study more about what this time is going</text>
  <text start="443.69" dur="4.52">to be like when Yahshua rules and reigns</text>
  <text start="445.94" dur="5.18">from Jerusalem for a thousand years</text>
