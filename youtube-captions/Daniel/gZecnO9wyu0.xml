  <text start="283.1" dur="3.54">fields and just talking to the issue ax</text>
  <text start="284.54" dur="5.16">would amount to weeks if you add them up</text>
  <text start="286.64" dur="4.529">I would be pleading begging negotiating</text>
  <text start="289.7" dur="3.99">and sometimes crying to the Lord to</text>
  <text start="291.169" dur="5.971">please bless my path just so I can</text>
  <text start="293.69" dur="5.46">provide for my family and take the</text>

  <text start="304.37" dur="4.26">prayers is he always not listening to me</text>
  <text start="306.14" dur="4.02">now I did not hear an audible voice it</text>
  <text start="308.63" dur="4.44">was more like a voice in my heart saying</text>
  <text start="310.16" dur="5.91">your God is not listening to you why do</text>
  <text start="313.07" dur="4.8">you not ask Satan I was shocked and</text>
  <text start="316.07" dur="3.42">surprised at the same time and did not</text>
  <text start="317.87" dur="3.93">know why that was laid on my heart i</text>
  <text start="319.49" dur="4.71">rebuked that thought and instantly asked</text>

  <text start="340.52" dur="4.14">months now and not a single sales</text>
  <text start="342.2" dur="3.93">materialized sometimes self-harm</text>
  <text start="344.66" dur="4.41">thoughts would cross my mind out of</text>

  <text start="459.529" dur="5.431">in water I was using a teaspoon of water</text>
  <text start="462.4" dur="6.419">every three hours and what this does is</text>
  <text start="464.96" dur="6.419">this sucks poisons out of your system</text>

  <text start="511.219" dur="5.251">you could have gelatin in it and gelatin</text>
  <text start="513.199" dur="6.661">oftentimes comes from pig</text>
  <text start="516.47" dur="5.16">you know I stay away from pork shellfish</text>

  <text start="561.5" dur="4.59">organic castor oil along with I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="564.23" dur="7.35">have it here right here but some organic</text>
  <text start="566.09" dur="6.3">essential oil peppermint oil as well so</text>
  <text start="571.58" dur="2.67">I&amp;#39;ve been taking all that and this</text>
  <text start="572.39" dur="3.24">definitely all might help me feel a lot</text>
  <text start="574.25" dur="3.66">better over the last couple days but</text>
  <text start="575.63" dur="3.78">even today I still woke up and still</text>
  <text start="577.91" dur="4.11">felt this tickle my throat was still</text>
  <text start="579.41" dur="4.47">coughing some too well when I was at the</text>
  <text start="582.02" dur="4.26">store because several people had</text>
  <text start="583.88" dur="3.6">mentioned oregano oil and olive leaf and</text>
  <text start="586.28" dur="3.63">I had known about this as well but I</text>
  <text start="587.48" dur="4.2">couldn&amp;#39;t find it at our local health</text>
  <text start="589.91" dur="3.72">food store so when I was at Fred Meyer</text>
  <text start="591.68" dur="4.68">which is our grocery store I actually</text>
  <text start="593.63" dur="5.91">found this blend of oregano oil and</text>
  <text start="596.36" dur="5.07">olive leaf now this isn&amp;#39;t really gross</text>
  <text start="599.54" dur="3.24">stuff it tastes horrible</text>
  <text start="601.43" dur="4.41">because it&amp;#39;s not like an alcohol</text>
  <text start="602.78" dur="7.97">solution but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s organic and</text>
  <text start="605.84" dur="7.41">you put 30 drops of this in water and</text>
  <text start="610.75" dur="4.87">I&amp;#39;ve done this now three times a day and</text>
  <text start="613.25" dur="4.71">man I actually got through the entire</text>
  <text start="615.62" dur="3.719">prayer meeting tonight because we do</text>
  <text start="617.96" dur="4.47">like praise and worship for an hour</text>
  <text start="619.339" dur="5.701">actually is able to sing all for the</text>
  <text start="622.43" dur="5.07">praise and worship without coughing even</text>
  <text start="625.04" dur="4.47">once so this stuff is really powerful I</text>
  <text start="627.5" dur="3.72">almost think that I might have been able</text>
  <text start="629.51" dur="4.86">to just use this and this might have</text>
  <text start="631.22" dur="5.93">been powerful enough to to combat my</text>
  <text start="634.37" dur="5.7">cough and head cold because I feel I</text>
  <text start="637.15" dur="5.77">feel way way way better I have having</text>
  <text start="640.07" dur="6.99">taken this so oregano oil and olive leaf</text>
