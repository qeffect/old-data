  <text start="75.81" dur="6.78">solar eclipse is marked this out of</text>
  <text start="79.17" dur="6.449">course I want to you know I met many</text>
  <text start="82.59" dur="4.139">years ago I said that Yom true 2017 was</text>
  <text start="85.619" dur="2.82">gonna be the day that Messiah would</text>
  <text start="86.729" dur="3.75">return that we would get resurrected</text>
  <text start="88.439" dur="2.701">caught up to be with him I was wrong on</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="4.171">that</text>
  <text start="91.14" dur="6.36">I still get comments of people who find</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="3.899">my videos from way back in 2011 and 2012</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="2.88">in 2013</text>
  <text start="98.549" dur="3.451">and they&amp;#39;re like oh you really believe</text>
  <text start="100.38" dur="4.769">this but I did post a bunch of videos in</text>
  <text start="102" dur="6.119">2014 showing hey I was wrong I missed it</text>
  <text start="105.149" dur="5.04">on this I do still think 2017 is very</text>
  <text start="108.119" dur="4.79">significant because it&amp;#39;s 50 years from</text>
  <text start="110.189" dur="5.841">1967 I think it&amp;#39;s a jubilee year I</text>
  <text start="112.909" dur="6.131">strongly believe that the Jewish temple</text>
  <text start="116.03" dur="6.43">will be rebuilt at some point later this</text>
  <text start="119.04" dur="5.039">year and I would not be surprised if</text>
  <text start="122.46" dur="3.78">some major events happen during the fall</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="4.35">feast we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see what</text>
  <text start="126.24" dur="3.62">happens but just the fact that this</text>
  <text start="128.429" dur="4.521">total lunar</text>
  <text start="129.86" dur="6.12">stood me total total solar eclipse that</text>
  <text start="132.95" dur="5.94">crossed America started exactly you know</text>
  <text start="135.98" dur="5.52">30 days before Yom true and and 40 days</text>
  <text start="138.89" dur="4.92">before Yom Kippur to me that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="141.5" dur="4.05">significant i I never remember this</text>
  <text start="143.81" dur="5.28">happening I I do remember a couple of</text>
  <text start="145.55" dur="5.67">years ago where a total solar eclipse in</text>
  <text start="149.09" dur="5.73">another part of the world started the</text>
  <text start="151.22" dur="7.29">year started the Hebrew year but never</text>
  <text start="154.82" dur="7.5">right before Yom toru up so what does</text>
  <text start="158.51" dur="7.29">this all mean on the positive side I was</text>
  <text start="162.32" dur="5.61">praying a couple nights ago and as I saw</text>
  <text start="165.8" dur="4.14">the image of the moon in front of the</text>
  <text start="167.93" dur="3.87">Sun and you see this sort of sun&amp;#39;s glory</text>
  <text start="169.94" dur="3.99">around the moon I was thinking how the</text>
  <text start="171.8" dur="4.26">moon represents the bride and the Sun</text>
  <text start="173.93" dur="5.279">represents yah represents the Messiah</text>
  <text start="176.06" dur="5.7">and how when the moon was right in front</text>
  <text start="179.209" dur="5.161">of the Sun how the sun&amp;#39;s halo the glory</text>
  <text start="181.76" dur="4.83">of the Sun was surrounding the moon</text>
  <text start="184.37" dur="5.16">which reminds me it&amp;#39;s a like a prophetic</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="5.7">shadow picture of his glory surrounding</text>
  <text start="189.53" dur="5.04">the bride the purified bride when he</text>
  <text start="192.29" dur="5.34">when he takes us to be with him so it</text>
  <text start="194.57" dur="4.38">was kind of a sign of hope but we also</text>
  <text start="197.63" dur="3.06">know that you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="198.95" dur="3.66">language in the scripture about the Sun</text>
  <text start="200.69" dur="4.7">being turned to sackcloth and the moon</text>
  <text start="202.61" dur="6.03">turning to blood and those being</text>
  <text start="205.39" dur="7.5">warnings tell you what&amp;#39;s on my heart I</text>
  <text start="208.64" dur="6.599">just what I see I keep thinking oh well</text>
  <text start="212.89" dur="3.7">is there gonna be revival is there gonna</text>
  <text start="215.239" dur="3.75">be repentance is there gonna be a</text>
  <text start="216.59" dur="6.03">eternity yawn I just don&amp;#39;t see that I</text>
  <text start="218.989" dur="7.231">just see more and more apostasy more and</text>
  <text start="222.62" dur="6.99">more falling away just a personal</text>
  <text start="226.22" dur="5.79">testimony so they have this love for</text>
  <text start="229.61" dur="5.55">Israel conference here that I could do</text>
  <text start="232.01" dur="6.12">every year just a few weeks ago this</text>
  <text start="235.16" dur="4.799">this summer here in July and you know</text>
  <text start="238.13" dur="3.69">they were saying like oh you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="239.959" dur="2.941">not gonna charge any money this time and</text>
  <text start="241.82" dur="2.4">we&amp;#39;re not going to buy or sell on</text>
  <text start="242.9" dur="3.78">Shabbat and we&amp;#39;re gonna make sure it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.22" dur="4.2">all you know shut down by Shabbat and</text>
  <text start="246.68" dur="2.79">everything and and I prayed about it</text>
  <text start="248.42" dur="2.76">because I had some friends that were</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="4.29">going and and I just still didn&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="251.18" dur="4.71">peace about going and then I found out</text>
  <text start="253.76" dur="6.479">later from someone who went that</text>
  <text start="255.89" dur="5.46">basically the organiz I organizers of</text>
  <text start="260.239" dur="3.151">this event</text>
  <text start="261.35" dur="4.56">they had to go into debt to put this on</text>
  <text start="263.39" dur="4.14">and then on Shabbat they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="265.91" dur="3.84">appealing to the audience for money to</text>
  <text start="267.53" dur="4.92">pay off this debt okay which is a total</text>
  <text start="269.75" dur="5.79">of BA abomination but what was really</text>
  <text start="272.45" dur="5.13">sad is that you know the friends that I</text>
  <text start="275.54" dur="4.77">knew the the wife of this friend she was</text>
  <text start="277.58" dur="5.24">like oh I got so drunk with yah and the</text>
  <text start="280.31" dur="5.49">Holy Spirit and it was so amazing and</text>
  <text start="282.82" dur="5.55">what I see is a complete abomination</text>
  <text start="285.8" dur="4.74">that violates the word violated Shabbat</text>
  <text start="288.37" dur="3.79">asking for money on Shabbat to pay off a</text>
  <text start="290.54" dur="3.51">debt which you should never go into debt</text>
  <text start="292.16" dur="3.63">to hold a conference and you should</text>
  <text start="294.05" dur="3.6">never be asking for money on Shabbat to</text>
  <text start="295.79" dur="3.69">pay off a debt I mean the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="297.65" dur="5.13">just wrong you don&amp;#39;t see this anywhere</text>
  <text start="299.48" dur="4.59">in Scripture and yet the testimonies of</text>
  <text start="302.78" dur="3.39">the people that went were like oh I got</text>
  <text start="304.07" dur="4.17">so drunk by the love of the Spirit and</text>
  <text start="306.17" dur="4.35">and something just rose up in me I</text>
  <text start="308.24" dur="3.6">thought this is such an abomination and</text>
  <text start="310.52" dur="2.97">this is what I see this is like a</text>
  <text start="311.84" dur="4.8">microcosm of what I see is just there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="313.49" dur="4.56">a pasta see all through Hebrew Messianic</text>
  <text start="316.64" dur="3.47">movement the Christian movement it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.05" dur="4.83">just everywhere where people are</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="5.14">violating the word violating the Torah</text>
  <text start="322.88" dur="4.05">violating a scripture and yet saying</text>
  <text start="325.25" dur="3.99">that it&amp;#39;s such a blessing and so</text>
  <text start="326.93" dur="6.51">wonderful in my mind it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="329.24" dur="5.43">Antichrist even the guy that I used to</text>
  <text start="333.44" dur="4.92">preach with you know I was preaching</text>
  <text start="334.67" dur="5.73">with him all last year and he came to a</text>
  <text start="338.36" dur="3.39">point where he did not want to keep the</text>
  <text start="340.4" dur="3.06">Torah he was like no we don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="341.75" dur="2.88">keep the Hebrew feast days those aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="343.46" dur="2.76">important no we don&amp;#39;t need to be</text>
  <text start="344.63" dur="3.39">circumcised and it&amp;#39;s one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="346.22" dur="3.84">why I started making this this video in</text>
  <text start="348.02" dur="4.8">this video series that I&amp;#39;m doing showing</text>
  <text start="350.06" dur="6.21">that Apostle Paul always upheld the tour</text>
  <text start="352.82" dur="5.34">just like Messiah did I just continue to</text>
  <text start="356.27" dur="4.59">see this apostasy coming out and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="358.16" dur="4.41">trying to like embarrass people with</text>
  <text start="360.86" dur="3.9">this video I&amp;#39;m just saying look there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="362.57" dur="5.64">apostasy going on even in home</text>
