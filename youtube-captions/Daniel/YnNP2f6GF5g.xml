  <text start="0.26" dur="4.42">Shalom this is Daniel John Lee with tor</text>
  <text start="2.76" dur="4.829">restoration ministries and this is</text>
  <text start="4.68" dur="4.86">irrefutable proof that evolution is a</text>
  <text start="7.589" dur="4.291">myth</text>
  <text start="9.54" dur="4.11">continuing in my series of providing</text>
  <text start="11.88" dur="5.31">proof - if you&amp;#39;re an atheist and</text>
  <text start="13.65" dur="5.789">agnostic skeptic pagan just an</text>
  <text start="17.19" dur="5.94">unbeliever anyone who does not accept</text>
  <text start="19.439" dur="5.491">Yahshua as king this is another video</text>
  <text start="23.13" dur="3">for that series and also any believers</text>
  <text start="24.93" dur="3.66">who listen to this you can share this</text>
  <text start="26.13" dur="4.17">with friends or family this is dealing</text>
  <text start="28.59" dur="4.29">with the subject of evolution I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="30.3" dur="5.16">talking about microevolution ok so</text>
  <text start="32.88" dur="4.5">slight variations within species but</text>
  <text start="35.46" dur="3.72">macro evolution where you know one</text>
  <text start="37.38" dur="4.41">species transforms into another that we</text>
  <text start="39.18" dur="4.649">go we can go from a fish to a to a</text>
  <text start="41.79" dur="3.81">mammal to a human I mean it&amp;#39;s just you</text>
  <text start="43.829" dur="6.21">know that type of ridiculous nonsense</text>
  <text start="45.6" dur="7.25">and we&amp;#39;re gonna discuss a idea that has</text>
  <text start="50.039" dur="4.381">been brought up within the movement of</text>
  <text start="52.85" dur="4.689">intelligent design and that is</text>
  <text start="54.42" dur="5.22">irreducible complexity so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="57.539" dur="5.16">make this very simple we talk about the</text>
  <text start="59.64" dur="6.479">human eyeball human eyeball has over 200</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="5.551">different intricate components without</text>
  <text start="66.119" dur="4.951">any one of those components the eyeball</text>
  <text start="68.25" dur="4.86">would not function it would not it would</text>
  <text start="71.07" dur="5.1">not allow us to see the way we see and</text>
  <text start="73.11" dur="4.95">perceive things around us so how could</text>
  <text start="76.17" dur="4.35">something like an eyeball evolve because</text>
  <text start="78.06" dur="5.699">it needs its irreducibly complex in</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="5.52">other words it needs all 200 of those or</text>
  <text start="83.759" dur="5.101">200 plus of those individual components</text>
  <text start="86.04" dur="4.17">to make up the eyeball now the only way</text>
  <text start="88.86" dur="3.93">the evolutionist has been able to</text>
  <text start="90.21" dur="5.519">respond to this argument is they say oh</text>
  <text start="92.79" dur="4.2">no no it you know the eyeball could have</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="3.361">evolved it could have started off as</text>
  <text start="96.99" dur="3.78">just like a simple light-sensitive spot</text>
  <text start="99.09" dur="4.29">and then it eventually evolved into what</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="4.02">we have is the human eyeball today but</text>
  <text start="103.38" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s a major problem with that</text>
  <text start="104.79" dur="4.829">argument and this is the only argument</text>
  <text start="106.71" dur="4.53">the evolutionist has for this and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="5.04">the problem for that evolutionist sztyc</text>
  <text start="111.24" dur="6.39">argument even a simple light-sensitive</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="4.621">spot okay like the most simplest form of</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="4.529">an eye you can think of requires a</text>
  <text start="119.28" dur="4.909">dazzling array of biochemicals</text>
  <text start="122.159" dur="4.591">in the right place and time to function</text>
  <text start="124.189" dur="4.421">there&amp;#39;s a biochemist by the name of</text>
  <text start="126.75" dur="4.92">Michael Behe in fact I was able to</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="4.65">actually see this man in person hear him</text>
  <text start="131.67" dur="3.629">lecture when I attended</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="4.199">a university here in Oregon Gutenberg</text>
  <text start="135.299" dur="4.53">University back when I was in college</text>
  <text start="137.459" dur="7.59">and he states this I&amp;#39;m in a quote and he</text>
  <text start="139.829" dur="8.041">states that each of the light sensitive</text>
  <text start="145.049" dur="5.16">spot cells makes the complex makes the</text>
  <text start="147.87" dur="6.899">complexity of a motorcycle or television</text>
  <text start="150.209" dur="6.36">set look paltry in comparison now he</text>
  <text start="154.769" dur="4.381">goes into some sort of technical</text>
  <text start="156.569" dur="4.89">explanation about what what&amp;#39;s involved</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="3.78">when light strikes a retina and a photon</text>
  <text start="161.459" dur="3.181">interacts and all the things that go on</text>
  <text start="162.93" dur="3.75">with an eyeball but basically he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.64" dur="6.39">showing that that even with the most</text>
  <text start="166.68" dur="6.72">basic form of of an eye it requires an</text>
  <text start="171.03" dur="5.609">immense amount of complexity that that</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="5.25">cannot be explained by time chance and</text>
  <text start="176.639" dur="3.63">matter just sort of you know happening</text>
  <text start="178.65" dur="3.33">to form it I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a fairy</text>
  <text start="180.269" dur="3.981">tale at Smith it had to have been</text>
  <text start="181.98" dur="4.83">designed by an intelligent designer a</text>
  <text start="184.25" dur="4.84">transparent layer is also far more</text>
  <text start="186.81" dur="3.899">difficult to obtain than the researchers</text>
  <text start="189.09" dur="4.41">think this is talking about the layer</text>
  <text start="190.709" dur="4.791">that covers the eye the best explanation</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="4.049">for the corneas transparency is</text>
  <text start="195.5" dur="4.629">diffraction theory which shows that</text>
  <text start="197.549" dur="4.891">light is not scattered if the refractive</text>
  <text start="200.129" dur="4.95">index doesn&amp;#39;t vary over distances more</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="4.769">than half the wavelength of light this</text>
  <text start="205.079" dur="3.961">in turn requires a certain very finely</text>
  <text start="207.209" dur="3.801">organized structure of the corneal</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="4.74">fibers which in turn requires</text>
  <text start="211.01" dur="5.199">complicated chemical pumps to make sure</text>
  <text start="213.78" dur="5.88">there is exactly the right water content</text>
  <text start="216.209" dur="6.03">I mean this is obviously this is</text>
  <text start="219.66" dur="5.46">obviously the product of an intelligent</text>
  <text start="222.239" dur="4.53">designer so even the most simplest form</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="4.25">of an eye cannot be explained by the</text>
  <text start="226.769" dur="5.81">random chances of two macro-evolution</text>
  <text start="229.37" dur="5.56">another really good argument that is</text>
  <text start="232.579" dur="5.201">related to the idea of irreducible</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="5.22">complexity is the DNA strand of course</text>
  <text start="237.78" dur="4.26">we know the DNA strand contains a lot of</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="3.809">different genetic information that</text>
  <text start="242.04" dur="4.919">genetic information has to be put just</text>
  <text start="243.959" dur="6.721">in the right sequence in order for it to</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="6.331">produce life and whenever we see</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="4.709">information put in a specific sequence</text>
  <text start="253.29" dur="4.08">we automatically attribute back to</text>
  <text start="255.389" dur="5.07">intelligent design you know if we say</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="4.95">writing you know on a book if when the</text>
  <text start="260.459" dur="4.231">researchers and archeologists when they</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="4.04">discovered the rosetta stone okay and</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="2.96">the rosetta stone of course has those</text>
  <text start="266.36" dur="3">three different types of languages on it</text>
  <text start="267.65" dur="4.079">they didn&amp;#39;t say oh look at how you know</text>
  <text start="269.36" dur="4.38">water and wind erosion just formed these</text>
  <text start="271.729" dur="3.96">these characters oh of course they</text>
  <text start="273.74" dur="5.519">assumed the rosetta stone was chiseled</text>
  <text start="275.689" dur="6.121">and made by people who were recording</text>
  <text start="279.259" dur="5.09">different languages and this is just</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="4.56">sort of intuitive of the intuitive</text>
  <text start="284.349" dur="4.481">assumption that we all make as humans</text>
  <text start="286.37" dur="4.229">when we see information that&amp;#39;s put in a</text>
  <text start="288.83" dur="4.29">specific sequence we know it has an</text>
  <text start="290.599" dur="5.401">intelligent designer behind it and that</text>
  <text start="293.12" dur="6.21">is exactly the case with the DNA strand</text>
  <text start="296" dur="6.27">so these two very very simple arguments</text>
  <text start="299.33" dur="4.92">can easily shatter this idea of macro</text>
  <text start="302.27" dur="4.049">evolution of Darwinian ISM evolution</text>
  <text start="304.25" dur="3.9">that time chance and man are just sort</text>
  <text start="306.319" dur="4.831">of haphazardly put it together there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.15" dur="4.65">no way no way that that that could have</text>
  <text start="311.15" dur="4.229">happened and of course if you want to</text>
  <text start="312.8" dur="4.739">know who the intelligent designer is go</text>
  <text start="315.379" dur="5.76">to my other videos irrefutable proof</text>
  <text start="317.539" dur="5.731">that Yahshua Jesus rose from the grave</text>
  <text start="321.139" dur="4.471">and you&amp;#39;ll see who that intelligent</text>
  <text start="323.27" dur="6.199">designer is this is daniel john lee the</text>
  <text start="325.61" dur="3.859">website is WWF</text>
