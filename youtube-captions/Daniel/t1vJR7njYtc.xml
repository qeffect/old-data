  <text start="17.34" dur="4.82">Ephesians chapter 2 this is a really</text>
  <text start="20.22" dur="5.01">beautiful beautiful little passage here</text>
  <text start="22.16" dur="6.76">where Paul I think very clearly shows</text>
  <text start="25.23" dur="5.879">that there is no Jew or Gentile anymore</text>
  <text start="28.92" dur="5.85">we are all one a messiah and not only</text>
  <text start="31.109" dur="6.36">that but we&amp;#39;re all supposed to obey the</text>
  <text start="34.77" dur="5.039">commandments that we find in Torah so if</text>
  <text start="37.469" dur="7.791">we go to Ephesians chapter 2 starting in</text>
  <text start="39.809" dur="8.101">verse 11 visions 2 verse 11 we read</text>
  <text start="45.26" dur="5.979">wherefore remember that you being in</text>
  <text start="47.91" dur="5.61">times past Gentiles in the flesh who are</text>
  <text start="51.239" dur="3.781">called uncircumcision by that which is</text>
  <text start="53.52" dur="4.289">called the circumcision in the flesh</text>
  <text start="55.02" dur="5.49">made by hands now remember there was</text>
  <text start="57.809" dur="4.91">this division right there is a division</text>
  <text start="60.51" dur="5.31">between the Jews and the Gentiles</text>
  <text start="62.719" dur="5.921">between those of the uncircumcision and</text>
  <text start="65.82" dur="5">those of the circumcision when in fact</text>
  <text start="68.64" dur="5.31">this division had grown so deep and so</text>
  <text start="70.82" dur="5.89">had so permeated first century Judaism</text>
  <text start="73.95" dur="5.76">that even those who were seeking to</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="5.25">become part of Israel were denied that</text>
  <text start="79.71" dur="4.35">that were denied being part of Israel</text>
  <text start="81.96" dur="5.28">and this of course is antithetical to</text>
  <text start="84.06" dur="5.309">what the Torah taught because we see we</text>
  <text start="87.24" dur="4.32">see examples in the scripture where the</text>
  <text start="89.369" dur="4.531">strangers where the Gentiles were</text>
  <text start="91.56" dur="3.96">allowed to become part of Israel as long</text>
  <text start="93.9" dur="3.63">as they decided to walk in covenant with</text>
  <text start="95.52" dur="4.02">yah and we see that with Rahab the</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="2.67">harlot we see that with Rosa Ruth the</text>
  <text start="99.54" dur="2.61">Moabitess</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="5.07">I went through a lot of that in in part</text>
  <text start="102.15" dur="6.179">2 of this series but and now we have a</text>
  <text start="105.27" dur="5.04">solution we have a solution that</text>
  <text start="108.329" dur="4.051">reaffirms what the Torah first</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="4.8">established and that is in verse 12</text>
  <text start="112.38" dur="5.699">where it says that at that time ye were</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="4.399">without Messiah being alien from the</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="4.89">Commonwealth of Israel and strangers</text>
  <text start="119.509" dur="5.68">from the covenants of promise having no</text>
  <text start="122.969" dur="4.531">hope and without yah in the world and</text>
  <text start="125.189" dur="5.701">then in verse 13 here&amp;#39;s the beautiful</text>
  <text start="127.5" dur="5.76">beautiful solution but now in Messiah</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="4.65">Yahshua you</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="7.89">who sometimes were far off are made nigh</text>
  <text start="135.54" dur="7.619">by the blood of Messiah so he says yeah</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="4.53">you were aliens you were strangers to</text>
  <text start="143.159" dur="4.291">the Commonwealth of Israel but now for</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="5.01">the blood of Messiah guess what you are</text>
  <text start="147.45" dur="5.61">now partakers of that Commonwealth you</text>
  <text start="150.69" dur="5.28">are you are in that Commonwealth of</text>
  <text start="153.06" dur="5.58">Israel now what that means of course is</text>
  <text start="155.97" dur="4.739">that you&amp;#39;re no longer consider Gentiles</text>
  <text start="158.64" dur="4.62">you are now considered part of Israel</text>
  <text start="160.709" dur="5.821">you have been grafted in and as an</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="5.94">Israelite as an adoptive Israelite now</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="4.56">those Commandments those instructions</text>
  <text start="169.2" dur="3.83">that were given to a natural-born</text>
  <text start="171.09" dur="4.259">Israelite are now given to you and</text>
  <text start="173.03" dur="4.599">that&amp;#39;s all through the blood of Messiah</text>
  <text start="175.349" dur="5.941">we&amp;#39;ve been grafted by this Jewish</text>
  <text start="177.629" dur="5.28">Messiah into Israel and now these</text>
  <text start="181.29" dur="2.91">Commandments given to Israel are for us</text>
  <text start="182.909" dur="5.371">and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really what Paul is</text>
  <text start="184.2" dur="6.36">saying here now things get kind of</text>
  <text start="188.28" dur="5.129">twisted as we continue on by by</text>
  <text start="190.56" dur="4.23">Christians saying oh no no we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="193.409" dur="3.061">to keep the commandments and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="194.79" dur="6.3">where that comes in so going on into</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="8.129">verse 14 for he Yahshua the Messiah he</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="6">is our peace who hath made both one and</text>
  <text start="204.599" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s broken down the middle wall of</text>
  <text start="207.09" dur="5.609">partition between us this is the middle</text>
  <text start="209.519" dur="5.851">wall of partition also that Yahshua was</text>
  <text start="212.699" dur="4.891">breaking down in Peters mind in Acts</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="7.38">chapter 10 which we went over in part</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="8.22">two of this series that in acts 10 we</text>
  <text start="222.75" dur="5.79">have very clearly Peter being shown a</text>
  <text start="225.81" dur="4.62">vision to show that Gentiles are not to</text>
  <text start="228.54" dur="5.22">be called unclean but they can they can</text>
  <text start="230.43" dur="4.769">become partakers in this move of the</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="5.939">Spirit that they can become part of</text>
  <text start="235.199" dur="6.15">Israel and so Paul&amp;#39;s just repeating this</text>
  <text start="239.699" dur="4.021">this whole concept that that middle wall</text>
  <text start="241.349" dur="4.53">partition has been broken down this this</text>
  <text start="243.72" dur="4.079">idea that somehow even those Gentiles</text>
  <text start="245.879" dur="3.69">who want to walk in couple of yata nope</text>
  <text start="247.799" dur="3.241">we&amp;#39;re not going to let you you know</text>
  <text start="249.569" dur="2.941">we&amp;#39;re going to look at you even you know</text>
  <text start="251.04" dur="3.24">they did have you know what was known as</text>
  <text start="252.51" dur="3.449">cross lights but they were still</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="5.009">considered second-class citizens and</text>
  <text start="255.959" dur="4.95">then again that is not what Torah allows</text>
  <text start="259.289" dur="3.661">the thought what Torah teaches that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.909" dur="4.711">why the first century Jews they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="262.95" dur="3.93">really keeping Torah they said they were</text>
  <text start="265.62" dur="4.26">but they really weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="4.86">they were keeping a man-made traditions</text>
  <text start="269.88" dur="3.87">a form of it but not really</text>
  <text start="271.74" dur="4.59">which is exactly what modern</text>
  <text start="273.75" dur="4.59">Christianity does is they keep parts of</text>
  <text start="276.33" dur="4.23">Torah but they infiltrate with man-made</text>
  <text start="278.34" dur="3.81">traditions and so we&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="280.56" dur="3.3">away from the traditions that come</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="4.35">against the scriptures in both</text>
  <text start="283.86" dur="4.76">Christianity and in Judaism and come</text>
  <text start="286.5" dur="6.84">back to the purity of his word and</text>
  <text start="288.62" dur="6.94">that&amp;#39;s a fault doing here in verse 15</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="3.81">now here&amp;#39;s prayers we have to be careful</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="4.26">I&amp;#39;m just going to read it having</text>
  <text start="297.15" dur="4.35">abolished in his flesh the enmity to the</text>
  <text start="299.82" dur="3.78">law of the commandments contained in</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="5.64">ordinances for to make it himself</text>
  <text start="303.6" dur="6.12">twain one new man so making peace and</text>
  <text start="307.14" dur="6.18">then you might reconcile both of the yah</text>
  <text start="309.72" dur="7.02">in one body by the cross having slain</text>
  <text start="313.32" dur="5.67">the enmity thereby and came in priest</text>
  <text start="316.74" dur="5.61">Shalom and peace to you which were afar</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="5.22">off and to them that were 9 alright so a</text>
  <text start="322.35" dur="4.29">lot of Christians will read this and say</text>
  <text start="324.21" dur="4.95">look he abolished the enmity of the law</text>
  <text start="326.64" dur="4.77">he abolished that now that&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="329.16" dur="4.71">he&amp;#39;s saying what he&amp;#39;s literally saying</text>
  <text start="331.41" dur="4.14">here is he abolished in the flesh so</text>
  <text start="333.87" dur="3.78">when he went to the cross when he went</text>
  <text start="335.55" dur="5.1">to the execution stake and he was</text>
  <text start="337.65" dur="8.22">crucified and then he resurrected three</text>
  <text start="340.65" dur="8.1">days later what happened here he put to</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="5.64">death the enmity that&amp;#39;s what it says the</text>
  <text start="348.75" dur="5.97">enmity that we have toward the Torah so</text>
  <text start="351.51" dur="5.49">I&amp;#39;ve talked about this before and that</text>
  <text start="354.72" dur="5.82">is that these Commandments these</text>
  <text start="357" dur="5.52">instructions this this this Torah before</text>
  <text start="360.54" dur="5.19">we fall in love with Yahshua before were</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="5.22">converted this Torah we have enmity</text>
  <text start="365.73" dur="3.75">toward it we don&amp;#39;t want to obey it we</text>
  <text start="367.74" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t want to serve it we don&amp;#39;t we want</text>
  <text start="369.48" dur="4.2">nothing to do with it it it is it is</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="4.02">enmity toward us it is a curse toward as</text>
  <text start="373.68" dur="4.41">it points just how much how wicked we</text>
  <text start="375.6" dur="4.11">are but once we fall in love with</text>
  <text start="378.09" dur="4.2">Yahshua once we fall in love with the</text>
  <text start="379.71" dur="5.42">Messiah those very same instructions</text>
  <text start="382.29" dur="7.35">that once brought enmity that that were</text>
  <text start="385.13" dur="6.16">accusing us now we want to obey we want</text>
  <text start="389.64" dur="2.88">we want to put in practice on our lives</text>
  <text start="391.29" dur="4.14">so that we can please him</text>
  <text start="392.52" dur="4.5">so our hearts have completely changed</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="3.6">because Yahshua now sits on the throne</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="3.2">of our hearts and so now these</text>
  <text start="399.03" dur="3.08">instructions that</text>
  <text start="400.22" dur="4.71">brought a curse and we&amp;#39;re once enmity</text>
  <text start="402.11" dur="4.17">toward us no longer now we&amp;#39;re at peace</text>
  <text start="404.93" dur="2.49">with the commandments we&amp;#39;re at peace</text>
  <text start="406.28" dur="4.17">with those instructions</text>
  <text start="407.42" dur="5.12">so what yahushua did is he put to death</text>
  <text start="410.45" dur="4.98">that enmity you put to death that curse</text>
  <text start="412.54" dur="4.72">that being quote/unquote under the curse</text>
  <text start="415.43" dur="4.47">of the law we&amp;#39;re not under the curse of</text>
  <text start="417.26" dur="4.86">law because he set us free and given us</text>
  <text start="419.9" dur="4.53">his spirit washer sin as was so that we</text>
  <text start="422.12" dur="4.71">have the freedom to obey his</text>
  <text start="424.43" dur="6.15">commandments and that&amp;#39;s the whole point</text>
  <text start="426.83" dur="7.23">that&amp;#39;s the whole point of his death</text>
  <text start="430.58" dur="6.15">burial and resurrection is that he gives</text>
  <text start="434.06" dur="4.62">us the power through him through him</text>
  <text start="436.73" dur="4.77">dwelling within us he gives us the power</text>
  <text start="438.68" dur="4.64">to walk in his commandments to walk in</text>
  <text start="441.5" dur="4.17">his instructions to do that which we</text>
  <text start="443.32" dur="9.96">wanted nothing to do with before we came</text>
  <text start="445.67" dur="14.88">to him hallelujah and so then he</text>
  <text start="453.28" dur="9.97">continues on in verse 18 for through him</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="5.49">through Yahshua we both have access by</text>
  <text start="463.25" dur="5.51">one spirit unto the father so again</text>
  <text start="466.04" dur="5.34">there is no Jew or Gentile in Messiah</text>
  <text start="468.76" dur="4.75">okay we both have access to the Father</text>
  <text start="471.38" dur="5.49">through Yahshua he&amp;#39;s done it he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.51" dur="6.21">reconciled us together now therefore ye</text>
