  <text start="3.06" dur="5.91">with tor restoration ministries it is</text>
  <text start="5.359" dur="6.101">Monday May the 7th 2018 and this is the</text>
  <text start="8.97" dur="5.61">seventh and final day of the feast of</text>
  <text start="11.46" dur="5.94">unleavened bread the 21st of Aviv</text>
  <text start="14.58" dur="4.35">the scripture says were to have all</text>
  <text start="17.4" dur="4.83">leaven out of our homes and only have</text>
  <text start="18.93" dur="5.4">unleavened bread from the 14th day even</text>
  <text start="22.23" dur="6.42">until the 21st date even less would be</text>
  <text start="24.33" dur="5.73">tonight Monday evening May the 7th so</text>
  <text start="28.65" dur="3.33">these have been the seven days of</text>
  <text start="30.06" dur="6.36">unleavened bread also known as Passover</text>
  <text start="31.98" dur="6.57">week and the 1st and 7th days are high</text>
  <text start="36.42" dur="5.49">shots that&amp;#39;s why celebrating a Shabbat</text>
  <text start="38.55" dur="5.279">on a Monday which is unusual because</text>
  <text start="41.91" dur="3.51">most shots fall of course on Saturday</text>
  <text start="43.829" dur="3.781">but this is a high Sabbath that can fall</text>
  <text start="45.42" dur="3.99">on any day of the week and the seventh</text>
  <text start="47.61" dur="5.31">and last day happened to fall on Monday</text>
  <text start="49.41" dur="8.16">this year May the 7th and a lot of</text>
  <text start="52.92" dur="5.97">people kind of wonder what to do for the</text>
  <text start="57.57" dur="4.669">seventh day of unleavened bread as</text>
  <text start="58.89" dur="7.5">you&amp;#39;re closing out Passover week but</text>
  <text start="62.239" dur="5.95">basically I mean it is a high Sabbath it</text>
  <text start="66.39" dur="3.87">is a day that we&amp;#39;re commanded to have a</text>
  <text start="68.189" dur="6.591">holy gathering like on a regular Shabbat</text>
  <text start="70.26" dur="4.52">or on the first day of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="74.93" dur="5.56">when Joshua crossed over the River</text>
  <text start="77.64" dur="5.85">Jordan we know that he crossed over</text>
  <text start="80.49" dur="6.48">right around the 10th day of Aviv when</text>
  <text start="83.49" dur="6.239">they were getting ready for the Passover</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="4.23">and they got circumcised everyone got</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="2.941">circumcised to prepare themselves for</text>
  <text start="91.2" dur="3.18">the Passover lamb and they actually had</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="4.199">the Passover on the shores of the Jordan</text>
  <text start="94.38" dur="4.349">so because of the timing of that it&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="5.64">belief that the seven days that they</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="5.791">marched around Jericho correspond to the</text>
  <text start="102.509" dur="3.661">seven days of unleavened bread which</text>
  <text start="104.52" dur="3.09">means on this day the seventh day of</text>
  <text start="106.17" dur="3.03">unleavened bread was the Victory Day</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="5.07">this was the day in which the walls of</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="5.099">Jericho came tumbling down and the</text>
  <text start="112.68" dur="5.369">Israelites got their first victory in</text>
  <text start="114.299" dur="9.36">their conquest to recapture the Promised</text>
  <text start="118.049" dur="7.5">Land for Israel so so this is a day of</text>
  <text start="123.659" dur="5.58">huge victory when the walls come</text>
  <text start="125.549" dur="6.241">tumbling down when those walls in</text>
  <text start="129.239" dur="4.501">Jericho came tumbling down and Rahab and</text>
  <text start="131.79" dur="3.93">her family were spared because of</text>
  <text start="133.74" dur="5.31">faith and willingness to protect the to</text>
  <text start="135.72" dur="5.25">spice this is the beginning of entering</text>
  <text start="139.05" dur="4.68">into the Promised Land the seventh day</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="4.35">of unleavened bread we&amp;#39;re on the second</text>
  <text start="143.73" dur="2.97">homer because yesterday of course was</text>
  <text start="145.32" dur="4.59">the feast of firstfruits which begins</text>
  <text start="146.7" dur="5.43">the 50-day Homer countdown to shavo or</text>
  <text start="149.91" dur="4.83">Pentecost which will happen in late June</text>
  <text start="152.13" dur="7.92">this year so we&amp;#39;re in that 50-day</text>
  <text start="154.74" dur="6.93">stretch between now and Shavuot these</text>
  <text start="160.05" dur="3.41">are the days of course where Yahshua was</text>
  <text start="161.67" dur="4.14">on earth after he resurrected and</text>
  <text start="163.46" dur="4.69">instructed and taught his disciples and</text>
  <text start="165.81" dur="4.11">prepared them for their ministry before</text>
  <text start="168.15" dur="4.4">he ascended to heaven for the final time</text>
  <text start="169.92" dur="5.79">ten days prior to Pentecost</text>
  <text start="172.55" dur="5.35">so so this is a very important day of</text>
  <text start="175.71" dur="4.47">course it&amp;#39;s the final day of this seven</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="3.96">day long feast actually technically</text>
  <text start="180.18" dur="3.99">eighth day because if you count the day</text>
  <text start="181.86" dur="3.27">of Passover which kicks off everything</text>
  <text start="184.17" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s sort of an eight-day feasts</text>
  <text start="185.13" dur="6.15">mirror&amp;#39;s Sukkot in the fall but this is</text>
