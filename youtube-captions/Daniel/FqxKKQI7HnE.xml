  <text start="122.34" dur="4.889">generals and 11 throughout scripture</text>

  <text start="127.229" dur="3.121">ten generals</text>
  <text start="128.07" dur="4.919">that he rules over in the demonic</text>
  <text start="130.35" dur="3.359">spiritual double world okay so I wanted</text>
  <text start="132.989" dur="5.941">to make that very clear</text>
  <text start="133.709" dur="9.03">um how where is my where&amp;#39;s my eraser see</text>
  <text start="138.93" dur="6.45">this is why I need a wife I need a woman</text>
  <text start="142.739" dur="6.72">to help me keep my head on straight okay</text>
  <text start="145.38" dur="8.699">I&amp;#39;m just gonna use my um I&amp;#39;m just gonna</text>

  <text start="154.079" dur="3.541">wife is more viable than just finding my</text>
  <text start="156.18" dur="4.02">eraser but she definitely could help me</text>
  <text start="157.62" dur="4.14">out okay</text>
  <text start="160.2" dur="2.94">all right so we&amp;#39;re gonna continue on</text>
  <text start="161.76" dur="4.47">with this hopefully I&amp;#39;m not cuddling up</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="5.64">the speaker here I never know where the</text>
  <text start="166.23" dur="9.21">speaker is on this thing</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="9.36">okay so Pyramid of Giza this was built</text>
  <text start="175.44" dur="4.08">by Enoch as an altar to yacht in Egypt</text>
  <text start="178.14" dur="3.05">and you can read about this in Isaiah I</text>
  <text start="179.52" dur="5.1">think it&amp;#39;s either 16 or 19</text>
  <text start="181.19" dur="5.47">where this is going to be a future altar</text>
  <text start="184.62" dur="5.13">- yah even in the Millennial Kingdom but</text>
  <text start="186.66" dur="4.05">Enoch originally built the pyramid and</text>
  <text start="189.75" dur="3.45">how do I know that</text>
  <text start="190.71" dur="5.67">Enoch built the pyramid well you have to</text>
  <text start="193.2" dur="6.3">go into beyond the Bible you have to go</text>
  <text start="196.38" dur="4.83">into Jubilees and Jasher but Ian often</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="3.47">built the Pyramid of Giza and it</text>
  <text start="201.21" dur="4.2">survived the flood in fact there&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="202.97" dur="5.95">evidence of the erosion of the flood</text>
  <text start="205.41" dur="6.05">noah&amp;#39;s flood waters on this pyramid so</text>
  <text start="208.92" dur="5.85">Enoch built this and then remember Enoch</text>
  <text start="211.46" dur="5.19">he walked with y&amp;#39;all for 365 years and</text>
  <text start="214.77" dur="5.73">then he says he was no more so Enoch</text>
  <text start="216.65" dur="8.8">never died he&amp;#39;s a man in Scripture that</text>
  <text start="220.5" dur="6.99">never died never okay guys Elijah he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="225.45" dur="3.81">died I have a video where I prove</text>
  <text start="227.49" dur="3.84">through Scripture that after he got</text>
  <text start="229.26" dur="4.62">caught up in the chariot of fire he was</text>
  <text start="231.33" dur="4.2">transported to another part of Israel he</text>
  <text start="233.88" dur="3.54">wrote a letter to a wicked king of</text>
  <text start="235.53" dur="4.74">Israel and he died like any other man he</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="3.33">died like Moses so Elijah is dead all</text>
  <text start="240.27" dur="4.5">right</text>
  <text start="240.75" dur="5.88">he&amp;#39;s dead and buried spirit of Elijah</text>
  <text start="244.77" dur="3.45">came on John the Baptist but Elijah</text>
  <text start="246.63" dur="3.14">himself is dead he won&amp;#39;t be resurrected</text>
  <text start="248.22" dur="3.69">until the seventh trumpet resurrection</text>
  <text start="249.77" dur="3.82">unless he was one of the twenty-four</text>
  <text start="251.91" dur="5.13">elders resurrected when Jesus died on</text>
  <text start="253.59" dur="5.91">the cross but I don&amp;#39;t think so anyway so</text>
  <text start="257.04" dur="4.13">Enoch never died now that&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="259.5" dur="6.39">Tanakh if you go to the New Testament</text>
  <text start="261.17" dur="8.83">you remember Jesus said very clearly to</text>
  <text start="265.89" dur="5.73">Apostle John and Jesus said well if I</text>
  <text start="270" dur="3.21">have it John would to live until my</text>
  <text start="271.62" dur="3.18">return what&amp;#39;s that to you and so this</text>
  <text start="273.21" dur="3.87">rumor went abroad amongst the disciples</text>
  <text start="274.8" dur="5.85">that John would never die until Yahshua</text>
  <text start="277.08" dur="5.34">returned and then in Matthew 24 Yahshua</text>
  <text start="280.65" dur="3.33">says there be one among you standing</text>
  <text start="282.42" dur="3">here that will not taste death until I</text>
  <text start="283.98" dur="4.23">return in glory and power from the sky</text>
  <text start="285.42" dur="5.31">and then if you study history you</text>
  <text start="288.21" dur="5.78">actually find all eleven tombs of all</text>
  <text start="290.73" dur="6.09">the eleven apostles Peter was killed in</text>
  <text start="293.99" dur="4.69">Rome and Thomas was killed in India and</text>
  <text start="296.82" dur="3.06">you find all eleven James was killed in</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="2.91">Jerusalem we read about that the book of</text>
  <text start="299.88" dur="3.45">Acts all eleven of them died they tried</text>
  <text start="301.59" dur="4.17">to kill John by boiling him in oil they</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="4.05">couldn&amp;#39;t he wouldn&amp;#39;t die so they exiled</text>
  <text start="305.76" dur="4.02">him to Patmos where he received the book</text>
  <text start="307.38" dur="4.35">of Revelation somehow he must have</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="4.859">gotten off that prison Island because</text>
  <text start="311.73" dur="4.35">the manuscript of Revelation Wow</text>
  <text start="314.639" dur="2.731">up in the hands of the Ephesians and</text>
  <text start="316.08" dur="3.389">Ephesus and gotten to all the seven</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="3.419">Assemblies in Asia Minor Ephesus and</text>
  <text start="319.469" dur="3.871">pretty Moses and Philadelphia and all</text>
  <text start="320.789" dur="5.511">those so John escaped and we have no</text>
  <text start="323.34" dur="5.15">record of his death so John the Apostle</text>
  <text start="326.3" dur="6.489">never died</text>
  <text start="328.49" dur="8.16">okay so Enoch in the Tanakh and John in</text>
  <text start="332.789" dur="6.72">the Brit not a son has never died</text>
  <text start="336.65" dur="5.489">so who do you think are the two</text>
  <text start="339.509" dur="4.951">witnesses talked about in revelation 11</text>
  <text start="342.139" dur="3.821">who are the two men that have never died</text>
  <text start="344.46" dur="5.81">in Scripture that are going to die</text>
  <text start="345.96" dur="7.38">they&amp;#39;re going to preach for 1260 days</text>
  <text start="350.27" dur="6.009">starting on some future lamb day I think</text>
  <text start="353.34" dur="6.09">probably lamb day of 2018 will be on I</text>
  <text start="356.279" dur="4.531">think April 26 they&amp;#39;re gonna preach for</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="4.56">1200 a&amp;#39;s and then they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="4.229">murdered by the son of perdition in the</text>
  <text start="363.99" dur="2.669">streets of jerusalem and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="365.039" dur="3.63">lie dead for three and a half days and</text>
  <text start="366.659" dur="3.991">then they&amp;#39;re gonna rise up on when yom</text>
  <text start="368.669" dur="3.541">teruah is fulfilled at the seventh</text>
  <text start="370.65" dur="3.419">trumpet resurrection as described in</text>
  <text start="372.21" dur="3.209">first thessalonians 4 it will the dead</text>
  <text start="374.069" dur="3.301">and Messiah rise first and then we who</text>
  <text start="375.419" dur="4.11">are alive and remain get caught up to be</text>
  <text start="377.37" dur="4.65">with Yahshua in the cloud so John</text>
  <text start="379.529" dur="3.66">Apostle John and Enoch are the two</text>
  <text start="382.02" dur="3.03">witnesses okay</text>
  <text start="383.189" dur="4.13">they never died but they&amp;#39;re gonna die</text>
  <text start="385.05" dur="6.989">and then they&amp;#39;re gonna rise again</text>
  <text start="387.319" dur="7.44">so Enoch built the pyramid and sometime</text>
  <text start="392.039" dur="6.9">in the 1st or 2nd century John and Enoch</text>
  <text start="394.759" dur="4.81">they met up with each other because they</text>
  <text start="398.939" dur="3.69">never died</text>
  <text start="399.569" dur="5.33">and Enoch now you have to go to acts</text>
  <text start="402.629" dur="5.01">1:25 to read about how Judas Iscariot</text>
  <text start="404.899" dur="4.621">when he murdered himself when he killed</text>
  <text start="407.639" dur="5.37">himself it says he went to his own place</text>
  <text start="409.52" dur="4.989">now no other sinner who kills himself or</text>
  <text start="413.009" dur="3.81">who dies it&amp;#39;s ever written about that</text>
  <text start="414.509" dur="4.65">because when a sinner dies they perish</text>
  <text start="416.819" dur="4.77">in their sins and when a a believer dies</text>
  <text start="419.159" dur="4.26">they they fall asleep in Messiah but it</text>
  <text start="421.589" dur="3.42">says when Judas killed himself and he</text>
  <text start="423.419" dur="4.201">killed himself he was deader than a</text>
  <text start="425.009" dur="5.041">doornail he hung himself with a rope and</text>
  <text start="427.62" dur="4.229">then he his body fell on a spear and his</text>
  <text start="430.05" dur="3.299">guts went all over the field and they</text>
  <text start="431.849" dur="5.761">buried him in the field of blood I mean</text>
  <text start="433.349" dur="6.151">he was dead he was dead so John and</text>
  <text start="437.61" dur="2.4">Enoch at some point they met up with</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="4.35">each other</text>
  <text start="440.01" dur="6.81">and they they took the broken body of</text>
  <text start="443.85" dur="5.79">judas iscariot and they they unburied</text>
  <text start="446.82" dur="4.77">him they took him and Enoch showed John</text>
  <text start="449.64" dur="5.01">the mysteries of the Pyramid of Giza and</text>
  <text start="451.59" dur="5.13">they put the body of Judas Iscariot the</text>
  <text start="454.65" dur="4.59">broken body of Judas Iscariot into the</text>
  <text start="456.72" dur="5.73">pyramid it&amp;#39;s kind of an abomination of</text>
  <text start="459.24" dur="6.36">desolation if you will is this wicked</text>
  <text start="462.45" dur="4.98">man was put into this holy altar but</text>
  <text start="465.6" dur="4.35">they were told to I mean y&amp;#39;all wanted</text>
  <text start="467.43" dur="4.8">him to do this okay so this so so this</text>
  <text start="469.95" dur="3.87">chamber that they found and how could I</text>
  <text start="472.23" dur="2.88">be wrong well I suppose I could be back</text>
  <text start="473.82" dur="2.91">I believe this chamber that they found</text>
  <text start="475.11" dur="5.37">is a burial chamber where Judas Iscariot</text>
  <text start="476.73" dur="6.18">is dead now there&amp;#39;s just one son of</text>
  <text start="480.48" dur="3.9">perdition Jesus identifies the son of</text>
  <text start="482.91" dur="3.78">perdition when he says it&amp;#39;s Judas</text>
  <text start="484.38" dur="3.81">Iscariot and then Paul writes about the</text>
  <text start="486.69" dur="3.33">son of perdition and first and second</text>
  <text start="488.19" dur="4.47">Thessalonians where he says that this</text>
  <text start="490.02" dur="5.07">man the son of perdition will rise up</text>
  <text start="492.66" dur="3.81">from the bottomless pit and he will rule</text>
  <text start="495.09" dur="2.52">and reign for three and a half years and</text>
  <text start="496.47" dur="5.07">John writes about the son of perdition</text>
  <text start="497.61" dur="7.17">okay so Judas Iscariot you know he</text>
  <text start="501.54" dur="6.33">killed himself he thought he thought he</text>
  <text start="504.78" dur="4.68">would force Yahshua to become king and</text>
  <text start="507.87" dur="3">that&amp;#39;s why he betrayed but of course it</text>
  <text start="509.46" dur="3.42">didn&amp;#39;t work out and he was sorry about</text>
  <text start="510.87" dur="3.69">what he did but it was just half of</text>
  <text start="512.88" dur="3.12">repentance he was sorry but he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="514.56" dur="3.45">turn his heart back to Yahshua and so he</text>
  <text start="516" dur="4.59">killed himself in a very selfish act and</text>
  <text start="518.01" dur="4.74">he died in a sense so Jews as Skerritt</text>
  <text start="520.59" dur="3.99">will be awakened in this pyramid when</text>
  <text start="522.75" dur="3.87">they discover his body and they back</text>
  <text start="524.58" dur="3.57">whoa I should have gone to hell I should</text>
  <text start="526.62" dur="4.79">have gone to lick a fire but here I am</text>
  <text start="528.15" dur="6">I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not I must be the Messiah Jesus</text>
  <text start="531.41" dur="4.36">really wasn&amp;#39;t I was the Messiah and you</text>
  <text start="534.15" dur="3.66">even see these blasphemous movies that</text>
  <text start="535.77" dur="3.9">Hollywood put out the Last Temptation of</text>
  <text start="537.81" dur="3.51">Christ and others where they suggest</text>
  <text start="539.67" dur="4.29">that Judas Iscariot was a good guy and</text>
  <text start="541.32" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s even some blasphemous plays</text>
  <text start="543.96" dur="2.1">about how Judas Iscariot was the real</text>
  <text start="545.49" dur="3.18">Messiah</text>
  <text start="546.06" dur="4.38">so he&amp;#39;s the Messiah so you know the New</text>
  <text start="548.67" dur="3.12">World Order will use Project Blue Beam</text>
  <text start="550.44" dur="3.21">and all this stuff to make it look like</text>
  <text start="551.79" dur="4.47">he returns and glory and power from the</text>
  <text start="553.65" dur="3.63">sky and they&amp;#39;re gonna take Ron White</text>
  <text start="556.26" dur="2.31">discovered the Ark of the Covenant</text>
  <text start="557.28" dur="3.41">they&amp;#39;re gonna take the Ark of the</text>
  <text start="558.57" dur="4.77">Covenant out from under Jerusalem and</text>
  <text start="560.69" dur="4.57">remember Ron Wyatt he was pure but he</text>
  <text start="563.34" dur="3.51">because he got so close to the ark he</text>
  <text start="565.26" dur="3.42">got struck with brain tumors because you</text>
  <text start="566.85" dur="3.78">have to be a Levite to touch the Ark or</text>
  <text start="568.68" dur="3.39">they got close or you&amp;#39;re gonna die if</text>
  <text start="570.63" dur="3.629">you touch the Ark and you&amp;#39;re not a</text>
  <text start="572.07" dur="4.019">Levite you die and I think Ron why</text>
  <text start="574.259" dur="4.13">he was the angel told him to stay away</text>

  <text start="693.119" dur="3.39">the end when it talks about the kings of</text>
  <text start="694.499" dur="3.54">the East coming against Jerusalem but</text>
  <text start="696.509" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;re gonna initially bow their knee</text>
  <text start="698.039" dur="4.29">and all seven of these nations are gonna</text>
  <text start="699.449" dur="4.89">submit to Satan who&amp;#39;s now possessed</text>
  <text start="702.329" dur="4.68">Judas Iscariot remember Satan gets cast</text>
  <text start="704.339" dur="3.691">out from the heavenlies at the very</text>
  <text start="707.009" dur="3.331">beginning of the tribulation</text>

  <text start="710.34" dur="4.14">woman flees into the wilderness and the</text>
  <text start="712.41" dur="4.71">two witnesses preach and then this</text>

  <text start="719.88" dur="4.17">who won&amp;#39;t bow their knee to him over the</text>
  <text start="721.77" dur="3.81">next forty two months three and a half</text>
  <text start="724.05" dur="4.38">years which i believe will be from Purim</text>
  <text start="725.58" dur="4.32">of 2018 until the fall feasts of 2021</text>
  <text start="728.43" dur="2.64">although maybe it&amp;#39;ll be held back a few</text>
  <text start="729.9" dur="5.07">years but I don&amp;#39;t think so</text>
  <text start="731.07" dur="5.64">so from turn Purim of 2018 until the</text>
  <text start="734.97" dur="4.02">fall of 2021 that&amp;#39;s three and a half</text>
  <text start="736.71" dur="6.12">years you&amp;#39;re gonna see this go down very</text>
  <text start="738.99" dur="6.69">likely but before we get to Purim you</text>
  <text start="742.83" dur="4.05">have to have a few things in place you</text>
  <text start="745.68" dur="3.66">can&amp;#39;t just start the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="746.88" dur="4.41">you have to first have so we have the</text>
  <text start="749.34" dur="4.53">first seal the white seal which I think</text>
  <text start="751.29" dur="5.1">is the United Nations and Trump and</text>
  <text start="753.87" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s already been broken the first</text>
  <text start="756.39" dur="5.13">seal is like all the apostate religions</text>
  <text start="758.55" dur="4.77">and false religion and even the water</text>
  <text start="761.52" dur="3.36">down lukewarm Christianity and Messianic</text>
  <text start="763.32" dur="4.32">religion that we see in the United</text>
  <text start="764.88" dur="3.39">States right now just why ya so angry at</text>
  <text start="767.64" dur="2.88">the United States</text>
  <text start="768.27" dur="4.44">so the first seals that white horse and</text>
  <text start="770.52" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s already been broken but the</text>
  <text start="772.71" dur="6">second seal is red and it&amp;#39;s red because</text>
  <text start="775.59" dur="5.19">of the communist nations of China Russia</text>
  <text start="778.71" dur="4.29">still communist I mean Putin was a KGB</text>
  <text start="780.78" dur="4.68">he isn&amp;#39;t forsaken that North Korea</text>

  <text start="785.46" dur="3.36">start a war let&amp;#39;s talk about in the</text>
  <text start="787.26" dur="4.44">second seal and when that second seals</text>
  <text start="788.82" dur="5.19">broken at war out of the ashes of that</text>
  <text start="791.7" dur="3.66">war the son of perdition will arise but</text>
  <text start="794.01" dur="2.61">in that war the United States and</text>
  <text start="795.36" dur="2.76">England and the West are gonna lose it</text>
  <text start="796.62" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re gonna lose the war and Russia</text>
  <text start="798.12" dur="4.44">and China again become victorious but</text>
  <text start="799.68" dur="5.76">Israel because its crowned with the the</text>
  <text start="802.56" dur="3.99">the boastful horn the the son of</text>

  <text start="806.55" dur="3.81">he&amp;#39;s gonna initially subdue China and</text>
  <text start="808.83" dur="4.35">Russia and so Israel will be the</text>
  <text start="810.36" dur="4.41">superpower so America will be cast down</text>
  <text start="813.18" dur="3.45">and Israel will become the superpower</text>
  <text start="814.77" dur="5.22">and and will rule over the seven</text>
