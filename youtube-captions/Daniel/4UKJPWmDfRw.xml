  <text start="14.88" dur="5.51">no restrictions entertainment it&amp;#39;s a Los</text>
  <text start="17.73" dur="5.459">Angeles based production company and</text>
  <text start="20.39" dur="4.479">they came out a couple years ago</text>
  <text start="23.189" dur="4.59">actually with a supernatural thriller</text>
  <text start="24.869" dur="6.601">called a child&amp;#39;s voice and and this is</text>
  <text start="27.779" dur="7.141">based on the testimony of former FBI</text>
  <text start="31.47" dur="5.76">agents documented court cases interviews</text>
  <text start="34.92" dur="5.389">from survivors all this type of stuff to</text>
  <text start="37.23" dur="6.27">expose child sex trafficking child</text>
  <text start="40.309" dur="6.311">abduction and and things like that so</text>
  <text start="43.5" dur="5.46">I&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and introduce John to</text>
  <text start="46.62" dur="4.829">you guys and first of all John I&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="48.96" dur="4.439">you to talk to me about your company the</text>
  <text start="51.449" dur="5.34">background of your company and what you</text>
  <text start="53.399" dur="4.861">guys do in film Daniel thanks so much</text>
  <text start="56.789" dur="3.66">for having us on today it&amp;#39;s a real</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="4.65">pleasure to be here with you</text>
  <text start="60.449" dur="4.14">my company no restrictions entertainment</text>
  <text start="62.91" dur="4.68">has been in business for over ten years</text>
  <text start="64.589" dur="6.421">we&amp;#39;ve produced six independent feature</text>
  <text start="67.59" dur="5.88">films all dealing with different social</text>
  <text start="71.01" dur="6.149">issue topics so everything from child</text>
  <text start="73.47" dur="5.82">abuse prostitution homelessness mental</text>
  <text start="77.159" dur="4.551">health vigilante justice and most</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="5.25">recently human trafficking of children</text>
  <text start="81.71" dur="4.839">all of the stories that we do at our</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="4.2">company are done through the narrative</text>
  <text start="86.549" dur="4.561">so that means these are theatrical type</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="5.73">films that you would see in a theater or</text>
  <text start="91.11" dur="6.689">even on the small screen but they delve</text>
  <text start="94.47" dur="5.82">into the world of these topics through</text>
  <text start="97.799" dur="4.981">these characters whose journey that we</text>
  <text start="100.29" dur="4.32">follow so very much different from a</text>
  <text start="102.78" dur="4.86">documentary which is usually fact-based</text>
  <text start="104.61" dur="5.219">it&amp;#39;s kind of recounting of events this</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="5.519">is the combined creative forces of</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="6">fact-based research and the creative</text>
  <text start="113.159" dur="5.28">fictional world that we create in our</text>
  <text start="115.829" dur="4.86">company so that allows it to be more</text>
  <text start="118.439" dur="4.171">expansive more immersive for people and</text>
  <text start="120.689" dur="4.351">that you don&amp;#39;t really have to know</text>
  <text start="122.61" dur="4.049">anything going into these topics to kind</text>
  <text start="125.04" dur="3.96">of learn about them because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="126.659" dur="4.531">you&amp;#39;re kind of lost so much so in the</text>
  <text start="129" dur="4.379">characters that you really are not</text>
  <text start="131.19" dur="2.77">focused on the subject matter until it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="133.379" dur="2.261">presented</text>
  <text start="133.96" dur="5.61">in front of him and that gives it a</text>
  <text start="135.64" dur="7.56">maximum emotional impact absolutely</text>
  <text start="139.57" dur="6.72">so using the method of storytelling to</text>
  <text start="143.2" dur="5.01">to wake people up to this topic that</text>
  <text start="146.29" dur="4.95">quite frankly a lot of people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="148.21" dur="4.98">really want to talk about yeah yeah no</text>
  <text start="151.24" dur="6.6">it was it was it tough it was a tough</text>
  <text start="153.19" dur="8.97">one for us I human trafficking was not</text>
  <text start="157.84" dur="6.75">something that was on my radar until the</text>
  <text start="162.16" dur="5.55">end of the 2016 general election with</text>
  <text start="164.59" dur="6.03">the Podesta emails and I kind of ignored</text>
  <text start="167.71" dur="6.39">most of the pizza gang stuff I I had I</text>
  <text start="170.62" dur="5.34">had checked out because I just I had</text>
  <text start="174.1" dur="5.49">bought into all the mainstream messaging</text>
  <text start="175.96" dur="6.39">that was going on unfortunately and I</text>
  <text start="179.59" dur="5.49">just saw it as a big s show that was</text>
  <text start="182.35" dur="5.07">going down as far as the election but</text>
  <text start="185.08" dur="4.35">because I had paid so closely attention</text>
  <text start="187.42" dur="4.58">to what the media was doing during the</text>
  <text start="189.43" dur="6.15">Democratic primary and how they were</text>
  <text start="192" dur="8.11">pretty much gaslighting everybody</text>
  <text start="195.58" dur="6.93">outside of you know teen Hillary that it</text>
  <text start="200.11" dur="4.41">became very obvious that I could put</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="3.93">these things together after the election</text>
  <text start="204.52" dur="4.44">of Donald Trump I started looking into</text>
  <text start="206.44" dur="5.85">all of these different areas and I went</text>
  <text start="208.96" dur="5.79">on binge watching them YouTube I went to</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="4.56">channels like yours and others who were</text>
  <text start="214.75" dur="3.63">talking about things that were based on</text>
  <text start="216.85" dur="3.99">facts and they were presenting research</text>
  <text start="218.38" dur="5.76">and then there was historical precedent</text>
  <text start="220.84" dur="5.94">so we got into the Franklin scandal</text>
  <text start="224.14" dur="5.94">Ronald Bernhard came into our periphery</text>
  <text start="226.78" dur="7.02">at a certain point he was the ex banker</text>
  <text start="230.08" dur="6.03">who exposed the Cabal and talked about</text>
  <text start="233.8" dur="4.32">the 8,500 people in the world that were</text>
  <text start="236.11" dur="5.1">controlling all of the wars the famine</text>
  <text start="238.12" dur="5.28">the disease the financial crashes and he</text>
  <text start="241.21" dur="6.09">had been a part of that between the</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="6.6">early 80s to mid 90s we looked at other</text>
  <text start="247.3" dur="4.77">people former FBI whistleblowers that</text>
  <text start="250" dur="5.07">were coming forward talking about what</text>
  <text start="252.07" dur="5.58">bush senior had done during his time</text>
  <text start="255.07" dur="5.07">with Reagan and that all of this crap</text>
  <text start="257.65" dur="4.98">has been continuing over decades and</text>
  <text start="260.14" dur="4.68">building not just in human trafficking</text>
  <text start="262.63" dur="2.8">but all of the crap that we see going on</text>
  <text start="264.82" dur="3.64">in the world</text>
  <text start="265.43" dur="5.519">today as an agenda and if you had told</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="4.44">me this three years ago I would have</text>
  <text start="270.949" dur="3.631">thought you were a nut I would have</text>
  <text start="272.9" dur="5.31">thought you were a conspiracy conspiracy</text>
  <text start="274.58" dur="6.78">theorist but it turns out that what</text>
  <text start="278.21" dur="5.429">we&amp;#39;re detecting is a symptoms of a much</text>
  <text start="281.36" dur="5.73">larger and bigger problem that has been</text>
  <text start="283.639" dur="6.721">laid over top of our world and suppress</text>
  <text start="287.09" dur="5.549">our true potential as human beings it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="290.36" dur="6.63">uh you have to I mean at the end of the</text>
  <text start="292.639" dur="6.21">day what I had to reconcile was you</text>
  <text start="296.99" dur="4.41">either believe that a beautiful baby</text>
  <text start="298.849" dur="6.301">child that&amp;#39;s born in front of you with</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="6.44">such love and care in its eyes and its</text>
  <text start="305.15" dur="6.42">heart and its spirit can somehow</text>
  <text start="307.84" dur="6.699">suddenly just turn on a dime when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.57" dur="6.45">loved and cared for by its parents it</text>
  <text start="314.539" dur="7.231">all of a sudden becomes a sociopath or a</text>
  <text start="318.02" dur="7.5">racist or a misogynist or a bigot or or</text>
  <text start="321.77" dur="6.3">a pedophile and what what I learned from</text>
  <text start="325.52" dur="5.61">my research and knowledge was that in</text>
  <text start="328.07" dur="5.58">fact no most all of this is kept within</text>
  <text start="331.13" dur="5.819">families it&amp;#39;s kept it starts with the</text>
  <text start="333.65" dur="6.57">families and then it goes outward so in</text>
  <text start="336.949" dur="6.331">essence it&amp;#39;s a you&amp;#39;d have to be a very</text>
  <text start="340.22" dur="6.09">cynical person to believe that human</text>
  <text start="343.28" dur="5.22">behavior and human nature is inclined to</text>
  <text start="346.31" dur="5.329">do such corrupt and horrific things</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="6.389">especially when involves children and</text>
  <text start="351.639" dur="6.641">the evidence out there is overwhelming</text>
  <text start="354.889" dur="6.631">in terms of our systems of power and our</text>
  <text start="358.28" dur="5.28">democratic institutions in essence just</text>
  <text start="361.52" dur="6">in this country alone but let alone the</text>
  <text start="363.56" dur="6.59">world have been taken over and used as</text>
  <text start="367.52" dur="6">organs for this network of people to</text>
  <text start="370.15" dur="6.13">basically exploit children on such a</text>
  <text start="373.52" dur="6.09">massive level that we currently as we</text>
  <text start="376.28" dur="4.919">know today have 5.5 million children</text>
  <text start="379.61" dur="3.529">every single year</text>
  <text start="381.199" dur="4.741">who are victims of human trafficking</text>
  <text start="383.139" dur="5.951">that&amp;#39;s globally and that&amp;#39;s what we can</text>
  <text start="385.94" dur="5">estimate today we do know that like in</text>
  <text start="389.09" dur="4.319">China they have organ harvesting</text>
  <text start="390.94" dur="5.77">dungeons where they take blood samples</text>
  <text start="393.409" dur="5.491">of people and according to their blood</text>
  <text start="396.71" dur="4.83">type they match them up with an Oregon</text>
  <text start="398.9" dur="5.61">and those people awaiting an organ</text>
  <text start="401.54" dur="5.01">donation are essentially going in and</text>
  <text start="404.51" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re taking out those people to be</text>
  <text start="406.55" dur="4.98">sacrificed and in many cases four or</text>
  <text start="409.16" dur="4.2">five or six times until the till the</text>
  <text start="411.53" dur="4.29">heart or whatever organ that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="413.36" dur="4.17">harvested out of them takes root in</text>
  <text start="415.82" dur="5.25">their body and is stable enough that</text>
  <text start="417.53" dur="6.03">they can continue living so it&amp;#39;s um it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="421.07" dur="4.65">unconscionable I had to check out at a</text>
  <text start="423.56" dur="4.2">certain point as well I mean just kind</text>
  <text start="425.72" dur="4.08">of distance myself because it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="427.76" dur="5.82">emotionally upsetting it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="429.8" dur="5.79">overwhelming and and the final analysis</text>
  <text start="433.58" dur="4.17">though my business partner and I at your</text>
  <text start="435.59" dur="4.95">Bravo decided that we were going to take</text>
  <text start="437.75" dur="5.25">this on in the way that we knew we could</text>
  <text start="440.54" dur="4.29">through film there&amp;#39;s nobody that we know</text>
  <text start="443" dur="3.96">that has been able to do something like</text>
  <text start="444.83" dur="4.23">this that exposes both the satanic</text>
  <text start="446.96" dur="4.89">aspect of this which is the child</text>
  <text start="449.06" dur="5.82">sacrifice and the ritual abuse and the</text>
  <text start="451.85" dur="5.28">human trafficking portion of it and the</text>
  <text start="454.88" dur="4.86">fact that there are very powerful people</text>
  <text start="457.13" dur="5.25">involved for which we were told to stay</text>
  <text start="459.74" dur="4.56">away don&amp;#39;t go that route you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="462.38" dur="4.05">labeled a conspiracy theorist at which</text>
  <text start="464.3" dur="4.35">case I said you know what this is the</text>
  <text start="466.43" dur="4.62">truth talking about this problem as</text>
  <text start="468.65" dur="4.92">being some kind a problem out in space</text>
  <text start="471.05" dur="4.86">or that it&amp;#39;s just something that happens</text>
  <text start="473.57" dur="5.1">and and we need to throw our money</text>
  <text start="475.91" dur="5.58">behind advocacy groups and organizations</text>
  <text start="478.67" dur="4.59">really doesn&amp;#39;t cut it the bottom line is</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="3.51">this every single one of us can do</text>
  <text start="483.26" dur="3.3">something about this starting with what</text>
  <text start="485" dur="3.81">we do in our own homes with our own</text>
  <text start="486.56" dur="3.54">children as well as what we do within</text>
  <text start="488.81" dur="3.99">our community whether it be at our</text>
  <text start="490.1" dur="4.2">church with local law enforcement or</text>
  <text start="492.8" dur="3.09">getting a group two people together to</text>
  <text start="494.3" dur="3.12">decide that we&amp;#39;re going to not only</text>
  <text start="495.89" dur="3.15">bring awareness to this but we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="497.42" dur="3.54">to start to look at how we can</text>
  <text start="499.04" dur="3.62">reconstruct our laws so that they</text>
  <text start="500.96" dur="4.23">protect all life on this planet</text>
  <text start="502.66" dur="5.19">especially our children because in</text>
  <text start="505.19" dur="5.61">today&amp;#39;s society that is not the case</text>
  <text start="507.85" dur="6.61">children are essentially the property of</text>
  <text start="510.8" dur="5.49">adults up until age 18 they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="514.46" dur="4.71">any rights especially when their</text>
  <text start="516.29" dur="5.1">concerns child abuse in the home the way</text>
  <text start="519.17" dur="3.9">that we we should be able to do which is</text>
  <text start="521.39" dur="5.48">to have children be able to come forward</text>
  <text start="523.07" dur="6.63">have complete legal immunity or at least</text>
  <text start="526.87" dur="4.96">representation and protection so until</text>
  <text start="529.7" dur="2.94">the claims that have been filed can be</text>
  <text start="531.83" dur="3.6">complete</text>
  <text start="532.64" dur="4.95">looked into by law enforcement and I do</text>
  <text start="535.43" dur="4.38">know that there is a line and a barrier</text>
  <text start="537.59" dur="4.17">that has been drawn where law</text>
  <text start="539.81" dur="4.35">enforcement can only go so far but I</text>
  <text start="541.76" dur="4.35">would say this if there is any chance</text>
  <text start="544.16" dur="3.96">for it it&amp;#39;s in the executive order that</text>
  <text start="546.11" dur="4.89">President Donald Trump signed after he</text>
  <text start="548.12" dur="5.49">got into office on human trafficking and</text>
  <text start="551" dur="5.36">the freezing of funds and going after</text>
  <text start="553.61" dur="5.43">different entities and groups worldwide</text>
  <text start="556.36" dur="4.51">that we could potentially take down</text>
  <text start="559.04" dur="3.9">because these are all of the people that</text>
  <text start="560.87" dur="5.07">are supplying the money and the funding</text>
  <text start="562.94" dur="6.21">and all of the all of the people in the</text>
  <text start="565.94" dur="5.58">supply lines globally that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="569.15" dur="4.98">this is all about is essentially the rot</text>
  <text start="571.52" dur="7.08">and the filth that has been put through</text>
  <text start="574.13" dur="6.6">our society message to us I mean I I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="578.6" dur="5.15">just I&amp;#39;m a little bit passionate about</text>
  <text start="580.73" dur="5.82">this but today I&amp;#39;m reading in team faux</text>
  <text start="583.75" dur="6.1">talking an article talking about how</text>
  <text start="586.55" dur="5.82">empowering it is for young women to do</text>
  <text start="589.85" dur="4.95">sex work this is the message that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="592.37" dur="6.57">going out to teenage girls in this</text>
  <text start="594.8" dur="7.44">country that sex work is inherent that</text>
  <text start="598.94" dur="5.63">sex work does allow them to have the</text>
  <text start="602.24" dur="5.55">financial freedom that they want and</text>
  <text start="604.57" dur="5.71">somehow it does just completely is</text>
  <text start="607.79" dur="5.43">irrespective of all the facts knowing</text>
  <text start="610.28" dur="6.69">full well what it really is like to have</text>
  <text start="613.22" dur="6.87">a pimp and what it really means in the</text>
  <text start="616.97" dur="4.68">era of me to to say this the young</text>
  <text start="620.09" dur="4.1">little girl is that you should go find</text>
  <text start="621.65" dur="4.68">an older man who can pay for sexual</text>
  <text start="624.19" dur="5.65">treatment of you I mean it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="626.33" dur="5.31">disgusting and and there is a spiritual</text>
  <text start="629.84" dur="3.54">battle in this and there is a cultural</text>
  <text start="631.64" dur="5.01">battle in this but it&amp;#39;s one that we must</text>
  <text start="633.38" dur="5.49">win because this is how the thing about</text>
  <text start="636.65" dur="3.96">this that I have learned over these last</text>
  <text start="638.87" dur="5.469">several years especially living out here</text>
  <text start="640.61" dur="5.709">in LA it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="644.339" dur="5.85">how educated you are how much money you</text>
  <text start="646.319" dur="5.551">have what knowledge or your awareness or</text>
  <text start="650.189" dur="4.59">what good you&amp;#39;re doing in the world you</text>
  <text start="651.87" dur="5.879">can be completely ignorant and in some</text>
  <text start="654.779" dur="5.97">cases you could say bought off but the</text>
  <text start="657.749" dur="6.9">reason why people do this is because</text>
  <text start="660.749" dur="5.82">they actually believe it their reality</text>
  <text start="664.649" dur="4.35">and what they think and feel inside of</text>
  <text start="666.569" dur="5.731">themselves is as real to them as your</text>
  <text start="668.999" dur="5.671">reality and my reality is to us and we</text>
  <text start="672.3" dur="5.67">need to draw a very hard line in society</text>
  <text start="674.67" dur="6.2">that says if you do anything to children</text>
  <text start="677.97" dur="5.58">you take pleasure and arming a child</text>
  <text start="680.87" dur="4.629">robbing them of their childhood and the</text>
  <text start="683.55" dur="6.899">love that they have inside of them there</text>
  <text start="685.499" dur="7.26">is no place for you in society at all so</text>
  <text start="690.449" dur="4.95">whatever that punishment is I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="692.759" dur="5.101">but they cannot be the people running or</text>
  <text start="695.399" dur="3.93">institutions they cannot be the people</text>
  <text start="697.86" dur="3.389">who are in corporate business and</text>
  <text start="699.329" dur="4.411">governance they cannot be the people who</text>
  <text start="701.249" dur="4.83">entertain us in Hollywood no matter what</text>
  <text start="703.74" dur="6.06">we think of their movies because let me</text>
  <text start="706.079" dur="8.721">just tell you James Gunn has no business</text>
  <text start="709.8" dur="8.009">directing movies for children at all and</text>
  <text start="714.8" dur="5.649">James Gunn is not the reason why</text>
  <text start="717.809" dur="4.981">guardians of the galaxy is successful</text>
  <text start="720.449" dur="4.86">there are plenty of other directors that</text>
  <text start="722.79" dur="6.69">are completely capable of directing a</text>
  <text start="725.309" dur="7.231">film so I don&amp;#39;t I have no use for the</text>
  <text start="729.48" dur="7.38">people in Hollywood who defend this crap</text>
  <text start="732.54" dur="6.75">they are amoral at minimum and many of</text>
  <text start="736.86" dur="8.789">the ones who are in the higher echelons</text>
  <text start="739.29" dur="8.909">are people that are completely ill and</text>
  <text start="745.649" dur="4.5">sick they are the ones that are</text>
  <text start="748.199" dur="4.14">messaging to you and I all of the</text>
  <text start="750.149" dur="4.951">progressive messaging or the liberal</text>
  <text start="752.339" dur="4.951">message of you know tolerance and</text>
  <text start="755.1" dur="4.339">diversity and what they really mean by</text>
  <text start="757.29" dur="5.31">all that is that it&amp;#39;s moral relativism</text>
  <text start="759.439" dur="5.62">it&amp;#39;s about it&amp;#39;s about well you are who</text>
  <text start="762.6" dur="4.799">you are and that&amp;#39;s what makes you you</text>
  <text start="765.059" dur="5.58">and you have a right to express that</text>
  <text start="767.399" dur="5.4">they don&amp;#39;t they do not draw any moral</text>
  <text start="770.639" dur="3.771">lines whatsoever and so this is why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="772.799" dur="3.54">so appealing especially the young people</text>
  <text start="774.41" dur="3.04">because their brains haven&amp;#39;t fully</text>

  <text start="787.71" dur="3.21">tolerance do you mean something</text>
  <text start="789.12" dur="3.66">tolerance to mean means something so</text>
  <text start="790.92" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s kind of this ambiguous ambiguous</text>
  <text start="792.78" dur="3.81">words that sound good but in reality</text>
  <text start="795.39" dur="3.69">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="892.65" dur="6.27">insanity so these people really do</text>
  <text start="896.13" dur="5.31">believe it they really believe what</text>
  <text start="898.92" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re telling us so it&amp;#39;s time that we</text>
  <text start="901.44" dur="5.46">step up we use our hurt we use our love</text>
  <text start="905.13" dur="3.9">our care for each other</text>

  <text start="909.03" dur="4.71">it in the most honest and whew</text>
  <text start="910.86" dur="7.11">away that is the love that comes from</text>
  <text start="913.74" dur="8.36">inside you the love that God is in my</text>
  <text start="917.97" dur="8.31">view is the one that is the answer that</text>
  <text start="922.1" dur="6.19">is Ewing of all things in this world it</text>
  <text start="926.28" dur="6.33">is not going to be through violence it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="928.29" dur="8.48">not going to be through what I want to</text>
  <text start="932.61" dur="7.32">say is it it cannot come from a place of</text>
  <text start="936.77" dur="6.91">hatred and anger to defeat the very</text>
  <text start="939.93" dur="6.09">people who have violated the code it has</text>
  <text start="943.68" dur="4.98">to come from what love is it&amp;#39;s far more</text>
  <text start="946.02" dur="6.9">contagious it&amp;#39;s far more powerful it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="948.66" dur="6.75">far more unified and so I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="952.92" dur="5.79">say that my commitment to making this</text>
  <text start="955.41" dur="6.09">film changed me forever the research</text>
  <text start="958.71" dur="5.97">changed me the filming changed me the</text>
  <text start="961.5" dur="7.23">editing of the film changed me because I</text>
  <text start="964.68" dur="6.57">had personal emotional experiences</text>
  <text start="968.73" dur="5.76">through each of those phases and when I</text>
  <text start="971.25" dur="8.19">came out at the premiere here in LA last</text>
  <text start="974.49" dur="7.23">summer at an audience of 400 people who</text>
  <text start="979.44" dur="4.65">had tears in their eyes after seeing</text>
  <text start="981.72" dur="5.91">this film because of the beauty and the</text>
  <text start="984.09" dur="6.18">love that was underlying all of it they</text>
  <text start="987.63" dur="5.22">did not grown adults had no clue that</text>
  <text start="990.27" dur="5.88">this was going on and they came out</text>
  <text start="992.85" dur="5.76">hugging our actors and our actresses for</text>
  <text start="996.15" dur="5.13">the betrayal the honest portrayal of</text>
  <text start="998.61" dur="4.08">their care for these children and the</text>
  <text start="1001.28" dur="3.81">fact that they were willing to risk</text>
  <text start="1002.69" dur="7.23">their own lives in order to save these</text>
  <text start="1005.09" dur="8.81">kids and since that time it awoke in me</text>
  <text start="1009.92" dur="6.42">a very deep spiritual belief of the</text>
  <text start="1013.9" dur="5.2">connectedness that we have in this time</text>
  <text start="1016.34" dur="6.18">and the reality that we live in and that</text>
  <text start="1019.1" dur="8.04">we are here to do and bring heaven on</text>
  <text start="1022.52" dur="6.12">earth bring heaven tours and the way we</text>
  <text start="1027.14" dur="4.98">do that is we live that every day in our</text>
  <text start="1028.64" dur="6.81">lives we try desperately as much as we</text>
  <text start="1032.12" dur="6.66">can in spite of our imperfections to</text>
  <text start="1035.45" dur="5.91">continue forward and learning about the</text>
  <text start="1038.78" dur="4.47">Word of God and love that is within each</text>
  <text start="1041.36" dur="2.16">and every one of us the child that lives</text>
  <text start="1043.25" dur="2.94">in</text>
  <text start="1043.52" dur="4.439">side of our hearts that is the most</text>
  <text start="1046.19" dur="4.26">powerful thing that I&amp;#39;ve come from with</text>
  <text start="1047.959" dur="5.491">all of this through all of it is that</text>
  <text start="1050.45" dur="6.42">the evil has no chance to survive when</text>
  <text start="1053.45" dur="6.03">that rises up and everyone else yeah you</text>
  <text start="1056.87" dur="5.34">you would think that it would be just a</text>
  <text start="1059.48" dur="5.85">no-brainer that we should not live in a</text>
  <text start="1062.21" dur="5.94">world where children are sacrificed and</text>
  <text start="1065.33" dur="6.21">molested and raped and things like that</text>
  <text start="1068.15" dur="5.04">but what I&amp;#39;ve come to learn through all</text>
  <text start="1071.54" dur="3.96">this investigative journalism is this</text>
  <text start="1073.19" dur="4.68">satanic pedophilia is literally the glue</text>
  <text start="1075.5" dur="5.28">that holds this deep state cabal</text>
  <text start="1077.87" dur="6.57">together and that&amp;#39;s what I think the</text>
  <text start="1080.78" dur="5.25">main part of this is all about I like</text>
  <text start="1084.44" dur="3.57">what you&amp;#39;re doing and I wanted to have</text>
  <text start="1086.03" dur="3.81">you on because you know I&amp;#39;m more in the</text>
  <text start="1088.01" dur="3.9">aspect of rage equate raising awareness</text>
  <text start="1089.84" dur="4.29">through investigative journalism and</text>
  <text start="1091.91" dur="5.28">making people aware of this subject but</text>
  <text start="1094.13" dur="6.03">you&amp;#39;re doing a different route which is</text>
  <text start="1097.19" dur="5.97">just as valid if not more so and that is</text>
  <text start="1100.16" dur="5.58">you are actually using the art of</text>
  <text start="1103.16" dur="4.59">storytelling to reach people who again a</text>
  <text start="1105.74" dur="3.36">lot of people don&amp;#39;t either they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1107.75" dur="3.33">aware of it or they don&amp;#39;t want to know</text>
  <text start="1109.1" dur="3.27">about it and I think what you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1111.08" dur="4.44">is very effective because you&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="1112.37" dur="7.14">the the mode of storytelling in film so</text>
  <text start="1115.52" dur="6.63">tell us more about this this this film a</text>
  <text start="1119.51" dur="4.62">child&amp;#39;s voice how it originated and just</text>
  <text start="1122.15" dur="4.62">more details about it sure</text>
  <text start="1124.13" dur="4.89">so my business partner Edgar Bravo he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1126.77" dur="6.24">the writer director and he was over in</text>
  <text start="1129.02" dur="5.37">Melbourne in the summer of 2017 for</text>
  <text start="1133.01" dur="5.43">business meetings with some of our other</text>
  <text start="1134.39" dur="6.78">projects and like I said earlier I did</text>
  <text start="1138.44" dur="4.65">the the YouTube things watching after</text>
  <text start="1141.17" dur="3.36">Donald Trump&amp;#39;s election to learn what</text>
  <text start="1143.09" dur="3.96">was going on and I started putting</text>
  <text start="1144.53" dur="4.22">together some pieces came across some</text>
  <text start="1147.05" dur="6.75">things on human trafficking of children</text>
  <text start="1148.75" dur="7.87">satanic ritual abuse sent that to Edgar</text>
  <text start="1153.8" dur="6.69">while he was over there and he started</text>
  <text start="1156.62" dur="8.16">watching it and within I think a day or</text>
  <text start="1160.49" dur="8.22">two he called me up to say I got next</text>
  <text start="1164.78" dur="8.19">film and we didn&amp;#39;t have a title for it</text>
  <text start="1168.71" dur="6.6">at the time but he said it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1172.97" dur="4.44">he wanted to do was to take these these</text>
  <text start="1175.31" dur="4.89">to people on the outside</text>
  <text start="1177.41" dur="5.879">a boy who&amp;#39;s a homeless heroin addict and</text>
  <text start="1180.2" dur="7.38">a girl who is being beaten by her</text>
  <text start="1183.289" dur="8.01">boyfriend and their their combination</text>
  <text start="1187.58" dur="6.089">and their love together was the nucleus</text>
  <text start="1191.299" dur="7.561">of the whole story because in the final</text>
  <text start="1193.669" dur="9.421">analysis the child is the one that that</text>
  <text start="1198.86" dur="6.9">is the life that comes forward and I</text>
  <text start="1203.09" dur="6.319">would say it gets revenge at the end but</text>
  <text start="1205.76" dur="7.71">it&amp;#39;s really a deeper power of</text>
  <text start="1209.409" dur="7.211">reconciliation and and also the</text>
  <text start="1213.47" dur="6.9">commitment to help other children was</text>
  <text start="1216.62" dur="7.799">the biggest surprise ending for us but</text>
  <text start="1220.37" dur="6.6">the story we wanted to make characters</text>
  <text start="1224.419" dur="4.411">that were essentially that you would</text>
  <text start="1226.97" dur="4.74">call the dregs of society or the people</text>
  <text start="1228.83" dur="6.18">that we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t typically see as</text>
  <text start="1231.71" dur="5.88">heroes and what we wanted to show was in</text>
  <text start="1235.01" dur="5.1">their their their trouble and the</text>
  <text start="1237.59" dur="6.449">selfish in some ways selfish life that</text>
  <text start="1240.11" dur="5.929">they were they were living that once</text>
  <text start="1244.039" dur="6.151">they broke free from those two things</text>
  <text start="1246.039" dur="7.571">once he cured his addiction and once she</text>
  <text start="1250.19" dur="5.01">got away from her boyfriend that the two</text>
  <text start="1253.61" dur="3.809">of them would begin to form this</text>
  <text start="1255.2" dur="5.219">relationship of trust and a bond that</text>
  <text start="1257.419" dur="5.611">would give a deeper sense of love and it</text>
  <text start="1260.419" dur="4.801">was symbolic that it was their love</text>
  <text start="1263.03" dur="6.24">together that brought the child back</text>
  <text start="1265.22" dur="7.709">from death the child at the beginning of</text>
  <text start="1269.27" dur="9.48">the film is sacrificed in a satanic</text>
  <text start="1272.929" dur="8.401">ritual what we did was we used the the</text>
  <text start="1278.75" dur="6.059">genre of the supernatural so that the</text>
  <text start="1281.33" dur="6.959">child&amp;#39;s spirit lived on after and the</text>
  <text start="1284.809" dur="6.391">child calls out to our main character</text>
  <text start="1288.289" dur="4.971">Tim who&amp;#39;s a homeless heroin addict for</text>
  <text start="1291.2" dur="5.52">his hell and he thinks he&amp;#39;s going crazy</text>
  <text start="1293.26" dur="6.64">until he has his heroin withdrawal and</text>
  <text start="1296.72" dur="5.51">the child essentially cures him and then</text>
  <text start="1299.9" dur="5.37">he gives him instructions of where to go</text>
  <text start="1302.23" dur="8.55">to start his journey to track down this</text>
  <text start="1305.27" dur="7.07">woman and save her life and we also</text>
  <text start="1310.78" dur="3.75">the other part of the story the reality</text>
  <text start="1312.34" dur="6.78">- this was the businessman the network</text>
  <text start="1314.53" dur="9.87">this was Rudolph and his cohort who were</text>
  <text start="1319.12" dur="7.98">both on a very tight leash where all of</text>
  <text start="1324.4" dur="5.88">the children that they were kidnapping</text>
  <text start="1327.1" dur="5.34">they were selling to clients and they</text>
  <text start="1330.28" dur="4.43">had to produce results because one of</text>
  <text start="1332.44" dur="5.79">the members within their network</text>
  <text start="1334.71" dur="4.99">potentially was starting to get into his</text>
  <text start="1338.23" dur="3">own business on his own and could</text>
  <text start="1339.7" dur="2.85">potentially crop compromised their</text>
  <text start="1341.23" dur="2.73">network so they had to send someone</text>
  <text start="1342.55" dur="4.11">after him</text>
  <text start="1343.96" dur="7.32">in essence though this this whole thing</text>
  <text start="1346.66" dur="8.7">was put together originally as an</text>
  <text start="1351.28" dur="5.88">episodic series because we thought that</text>
  <text start="1355.36" dur="5.4">we were going to be able to do this on</text>
  <text start="1357.16" dur="6.3">YouTube and we thought that we would be</text>
  <text start="1360.76" dur="5.67">releasing it as a web series on YouTube</text>
  <text start="1363.46" dur="4.8">and doing advertising and donations that</text>
  <text start="1366.43" dur="5.43">kind of thing and poor downloads for the</text>
  <text start="1368.26" dur="5.73">full full-length feature and once we</text>
  <text start="1371.86" dur="4.11">started seeing the censorship going down</text>
  <text start="1373.99" dur="5.04">we we decided that we needed to make</text>
  <text start="1375.97" dur="5.01">this film first and then find other</text>
  <text start="1379.03" dur="4.47">platforms that we could potentially put</text>
  <text start="1380.98" dur="4.44">it on as the webseries but we wrote it</text>
  <text start="1383.5" dur="4.62">it we did it as a feature we ended up</text>
  <text start="1385.42" dur="5.01">shooting it all as a feature and we put</text>
  <text start="1388.12" dur="6.6">it together and we had massive success</text>
  <text start="1390.43" dur="6.45">through YouTube and podcast better than</text>
  <text start="1394.72" dur="7.23">any review that we could ever get from</text>
  <text start="1396.88" dur="6.9">reviewer in film or on a magazine these</text>
  <text start="1401.95" dur="6.09">kinds of interviews that we&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="1403.78" dur="7.92">podcast talking with people about this</text>
  <text start="1408.04" dur="5.73">issue just saw an overwhelming support</text>
  <text start="1411.7" dur="3.81">and majority of people going online and</text>
  <text start="1413.77" dur="3.9">buying the film or renting it or</text>
  <text start="1415.51" dur="4.59">streaming it and we told them to say</text>
  <text start="1417.67" dur="4.86">look anything that you do with this film</text>
  <text start="1420.1" dur="5.82">if anything&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t just watch it for</text>
  <text start="1422.53" dur="4.8">yourself share it with other people we</text>
  <text start="1425.92" dur="3.6">have to get the word out to as many</text>
  <text start="1427.33" dur="5.01">people as possible just to start to</text>
  <text start="1429.52" dur="4.98">begin the dialogue because one film is</text>
  <text start="1432.34" dur="4.2">not going to change someone but it can</text>
  <text start="1434.5" dur="4.56">inspire good things that come forward</text>
  <text start="1436.54" dur="5.25">and then you continue to learn more and</text>
  <text start="1439.06" dur="5.52">what we did was with each and every one</text>
  <text start="1441.79" dur="5.46">of our videos that we did</text>
  <text start="1444.58" dur="4.68">we would always answer the people in the</text>
  <text start="1447.25" dur="4.68">comments because we wanted them to know</text>
  <text start="1449.26" dur="4.32">that this was important to us that you</text>
  <text start="1451.93" dur="4.2">knew what to do when you had a question</text>
  <text start="1453.58" dur="5.22">like where can I go what can I do how do</text>
  <text start="1456.13" dur="5.46">I get involved how can I do something to</text>
  <text start="1458.8" dur="7.37">affect this problem outside of the film</text>
  <text start="1461.59" dur="7.59">and the the the overwhelming response</text>
  <text start="1466.17" dur="6.01">what I mean it was it was just so</text>
  <text start="1469.18" dur="6.18">inspiring to see hundreds and hundreds</text>
  <text start="1472.18" dur="5.49">of hundreds of people you know they were</text>
  <text start="1475.36" dur="5.73">ready to do something after seeing the</text>
  <text start="1477.67" dur="5.88">film they were they won over something</text>
  <text start="1481.09" dur="4.17">in and the resolve through the journey</text>
  <text start="1483.55" dur="4.62">of the characters in the identification</text>
  <text start="1485.26" dur="5.04">of this story and understanding all of</text>
  <text start="1488.17" dur="4.56">what they had seen on the on the outside</text>
  <text start="1490.3" dur="4.14">the news articles everything from</text>
  <text start="1492.73" dur="5.16">Cynthia McKinney taking on Donald</text>
  <text start="1494.44" dur="6.06">Rumsfeld and DynCorp during that and and</text>
  <text start="1497.89" dur="4.26">so it was like it all came together for</text>
  <text start="1500.5" dur="3.54">them and they were ready to go and say</text>
  <text start="1502.15" dur="5.31">all right what can I do</text>
  <text start="1504.04" dur="10.65">here&amp;#39;s the great thing that I think is</text>
  <text start="1507.46" dur="9.57">is missing in some of the I guess in</text>
  <text start="1514.69" dur="4.2">some of the ways that the movie has come</text>
  <text start="1517.03" dur="4.79">across to people because there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="1518.89" dur="2.93">questions about</text>
  <text start="1521.95" dur="4.439">and really what it means is that this is</text>
  <text start="1523.87" dur="4.71">the beginning of the conversation I</text>
  <text start="1526.389" dur="6.181">don&amp;#39;t want to give it away but it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1528.58" dur="6.719">beginning of the start so in essence</text>
  <text start="1532.57" dur="5.609">there are some loose ends it&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="1535.299" dur="5.22">bit open at the end but the reason why</text>
  <text start="1538.179" dur="6.201">is because it&amp;#39;s the journey must</text>
  <text start="1540.519" dur="7.02">continue it must be that all of us</text>
  <text start="1544.38" dur="7.72">decide at a certain point what we want</text>
  <text start="1547.539" dur="7.321">to do in our society because taking the</text>
  <text start="1552.1" dur="5.28">pedophiles down and the networks down is</text>
  <text start="1554.86" dur="4.89">absolutely important and critical but</text>
  <text start="1557.38" dur="3.929">it&amp;#39;s the imagination of the people and</text>
  <text start="1559.75" dur="5.1">where we go from here</text>
  <text start="1561.309" dur="6.421">that is going to secure this never comes</text>
  <text start="1564.85" dur="4.829">back into our society again and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1567.73" dur="4.98">really what what we were trying to say</text>
  <text start="1569.679" dur="5.791">is that the love that you have for each</text>
  <text start="1572.71" dur="4.53">other is what gives you the strength and</text>
  <text start="1575.47" dur="5.1">the courage to go out into the world and</text>
  <text start="1577.24" dur="5.34">do miraculous things do the things that</text>
  <text start="1580.57" dur="5.52">most people don&amp;#39;t believe are even</text>
  <text start="1582.58" dur="5.969">possible and so our our whole goal in</text>
  <text start="1586.09" dur="4.98">all of this is to inspire and excite</text>
  <text start="1588.549" dur="4.681">people as to what they can do in their</text>
  <text start="1591.07" dur="5.25">own lives every single day and how they</text>
  <text start="1593.23" dur="5.15">can affect those around them especially</text>
  <text start="1596.32" dur="5.52">the children</text>
  <text start="1598.38" dur="4.99">absolutely absolutely so I know that</text>
  <text start="1601.84" dur="3.63">this movie a child&amp;#39;s voice it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1603.37" dur="4.83">available on Amazon for people can buy</text>
  <text start="1605.47" dur="6.54">it is it available on any other</text>
  <text start="1608.2" dur="7.349">platforms or yeah so for the people that</text>
  <text start="1612.01" dur="8.19">are you know listening worldwide we have</text>
  <text start="1615.549" dur="8.311">it now in 65 countries mostly on Amazon</text>
  <text start="1620.2" dur="5.579">and we do have also new platforms that</text>
  <text start="1623.86" dur="6.24">are coming online but one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="1625.779" dur="6.78">ones is Vimeo on demand so Vimeo on</text>
  <text start="1630.1" dur="5.13">demand is worldwide you can rent or</text>
  <text start="1632.559" dur="4.59">download it if you have Amazon Prime and</text>
  <text start="1635.23" dur="5.189">you&amp;#39;re on a budget you can watch it for</text>
  <text start="1637.149" dur="5.071">free by the ones that helped us the most</text>
  <text start="1640.419" dur="5.071">are the ones that were you rent or</text>
  <text start="1642.22" dur="5.13">download because we get we get a larger</text>
  <text start="1645.49" dur="4.14">portion of that whereas Amazon throttles</text>
  <text start="1647.35" dur="4.319">our search results and they&amp;#39;ve done all</text>
  <text start="1649.63" dur="3.899">sorts of things to suppress the the</text>
  <text start="1651.669" dur="3.221">amount of money that we get but I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1653.529" dur="3.761">really worried about that</text>
  <text start="1654.89" dur="4.92">I mostly care about is that somebody</text>
  <text start="1657.29" dur="5.25">sees the film shares it tell somebody</text>
  <text start="1659.81" dur="5.16">about it writes writes a review or just</text>
  <text start="1662.54" dur="4.62">or just simply has a watch party if it</text>
  <text start="1664.97" dur="4.62">moves you in a certain way maybe it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1667.16" dur="3.3">move other people too so they can watch</text>
  <text start="1669.59" dur="3.78">it on Amazon</text>
  <text start="1670.46" dur="4.62">then you on-demand sixty other platforms</text>
  <text start="1673.37" dur="3.12">internationally and by the end of this</text>
  <text start="1675.08" dur="5.13">year I would imagine we&amp;#39;ll be on a</text>
  <text start="1676.49" dur="6.39">hundred so just look up a challenge</text>
  <text start="1680.21" dur="5.22">voice and I think any of the videos that</text>
  <text start="1682.88" dur="6.96">are out there will lead you to be able</text>
  <text start="1685.43" dur="7.59">to buy it you know buyer or watch it in</text>
  <text start="1689.84" dur="5.34">your country absolutely wow this is very</text>
  <text start="1693.02" dur="4.98">very encouraging and guys I think this</text>
  <text start="1695.18" dur="4.71">this is very important because again</text>
  <text start="1698" dur="4.5">there are a lot of people out there who</text>
  <text start="1699.89" dur="3.93">either don&amp;#39;t know about this at all</text>
  <text start="1702.5" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re just completely ignorant about</text>
  <text start="1703.82" dur="4.74">this topic or if they do know about it</text>
  <text start="1706.07" dur="4.35">they they&amp;#39;re so uncomfortable about they</text>
  <text start="1708.56" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t want to they don&amp;#39;t really want to</text>
  <text start="1710.42" dur="6.33">explore it and having a movie having a</text>
  <text start="1713" dur="8.04">film is a very non-threatening way to to</text>
  <text start="1716.75" dur="6.15">raise awareness and I I cannot I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1721.04" dur="4.68">think I can emphasize how important it</text>
  <text start="1722.9" dur="4.02">is to raise awareness I know people</text>
  <text start="1725.72" dur="3.06">think what we got to do all these other</text>
  <text start="1726.92" dur="5.88">stuff but raising awareness is such a</text>
  <text start="1728.78" dur="6.63">key key way to bring about the end of</text>
  <text start="1732.8" dur="4.56">the Satanic pedophilia because the way</text>
  <text start="1735.41" dur="3.48">these satanic pedophiles have operated</text>
  <text start="1737.36" dur="3.42">is they operate in the shadows they</text>
  <text start="1738.89" dur="5.13">operate in the darkness they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1740.78" dur="5.01">this stuff to be exposed well by</text>
  <text start="1744.02" dur="3.15">watching a movie like this this is gonna</text>
  <text start="1745.79" dur="3.21">raise awareness people are gonna</text>
  <text start="1747.17" dur="3.75">understand what&amp;#39;s going on they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1749" dur="3.42">see what&amp;#39;s going on like what John has</text>
  <text start="1750.92" dur="3.87">said people then start getting excited</text>
  <text start="1752.42" dur="4.8">about okay what can I practically do to</text>
  <text start="1754.79" dur="5.73">start you know addressing this issue in</text>
  <text start="1757.22" dur="4.92">my local community just it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1760.52" dur="4.89">the way it&amp;#39;s what we really need to do</text>
  <text start="1762.14" dur="5.16">to wake people up because that is gonna</text>
  <text start="1765.41" dur="3.93">bring an end to this this horrible</text>
  <text start="1767.3" dur="4.47">horrible play that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1769.34" dur="3.93">infecting the entire world John before</text>
  <text start="1771.77" dur="4.98">we end the interview is there anything</text>
  <text start="1773.27" dur="6.18">else that you want to address well I</text>
  <text start="1776.75" dur="4.95">wouldn&amp;#39;t say one thing that my good</text>
  <text start="1779.45" dur="4.5">friend Jay Parker told me he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1781.7" dur="4.4">survivor of satanic ritual abuse it</text>

  <text start="1788.63" dur="4.08">and this is the thing that I keep in the</text>
  <text start="1790.43" dur="4.68">back of my mind he said the toothpaste</text>
  <text start="1792.71" dur="5.49">is out of the tube and it ain&amp;#39;t going</text>
