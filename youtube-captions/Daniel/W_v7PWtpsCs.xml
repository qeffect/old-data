  <text start="73.77" dur="5.01">case since that breakup she sort of went</text>
  <text start="76.86" dur="4.259">one way and I went the other of course</text>
  <text start="78.78" dur="4.26">everyone knows I believe that we need to</text>
  <text start="81.119" dur="3.781">keep Torah that we should not be</text>
  <text start="83.04" dur="4.14">involving ourselves and the pagan</text>
  <text start="84.9" dur="4.41">holidays like Christmas and Easter but</text>
  <text start="87.18" dur="4.2">we should be doing the feast days that</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="4.5">Jesus actually did pass over and Secotan</text>
  <text start="91.38" dur="3.809">Hanukkah that we should be eating clean</text>
  <text start="93.81" dur="5.03">foods and we should be obeying the Torah</text>

  <text start="107.189" dur="5.281">then after that after sukkot she was she</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="4.409">seemed to be open to the Torah and and</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="5.91">in fact she had shared with me that</text>
  <text start="114.899" dur="5.58">another individual in her life had</text>
  <text start="118.38" dur="3.72">spoken to her about the Torres she had</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="3.99">taken a class from her church about the</text>
  <text start="122.1" dur="4.71">feast days so she knew about it she&amp;#39;d</text>

  <text start="130.95" dur="2.61">she was familiar with the Torah and she</text>
  <text start="132.3" dur="4.68">seemed to be open to it and</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="6.72">she she was there at the Secotan I went</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="6.24">to she was there and then she came with</text>
  <text start="140.28" dur="5.91">me to various Sabbath meetings and she</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="5.19">seemed to be open to the Torah but in</text>
  <text start="146.19" dur="4.019">any case once we broke up and we went</text>
  <text start="148.41" dur="4.5">our different ways she very quickly went</text>
  <text start="150.209" dur="5.551">into her Christian ways which was to</text>
  <text start="152.91" dur="4.35">violate Torres she started going out on</text>
  <text start="155.76" dur="4.199">Friday nights and Saturdays and</text>
  <text start="157.26" dur="5.04">violating the Torah she started eating</text>
  <text start="159.959" dur="5.011">unclean foods and celebrating Christmas</text>
  <text start="162.3" dur="4.14">and all the things that that I believe</text>
  <text start="164.97" dur="4.38">were not supposed to do according to</text>
  <text start="166.44" dur="5.519">scriptures well through the course of</text>
  <text start="169.35" dur="4.169">after our breakup I was trying to I was</text>
  <text start="171.959" dur="2.971">trying to repair things because I was a</text>
  <text start="173.519" dur="3.901">little confused as to why we broke up</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="4.68">and them any way through the course of</text>
  <text start="177.42" dur="3.66">that she wound up filing a stocking</text>
  <text start="179.61" dur="3.209">order against me through the Clackamas</text>
  <text start="181.08" dur="3.6">County Courthouse now for those of you</text>
  <text start="182.819" dur="3.39">who know my past you know that I really</text>
  <text start="184.68" dur="5.55">do not like the Clackamas County</text>
  <text start="186.209" dur="6.121">Courthouse because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a place</text>
  <text start="190.23" dur="4.35">where I suffered many defeats at the</text>
  <text start="192.33" dur="3.719">hands of my ex-wife and losing contact</text>
  <text start="194.58" dur="3.18">with my children and just just a place</text>
  <text start="196.049" dur="3.391">that I don&amp;#39;t like so I was really</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="4.71">dreading this when the sheriff knocked</text>
  <text start="199.44" dur="7.019">on my door in early December and handed</text>
  <text start="202.47" dur="5.25">me this this stocking order and I really</text>
  <text start="206.459" dur="3.991">was kind of stunned and couldn&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="207.72" dur="4.23">it well initially when I got the stock</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="3.509">in order i was just thinking well i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="211.95" dur="3.99">just going to not contest it just let it</text>
  <text start="213.959" dur="3.481">go through because i have no desire to</text>
  <text start="215.94" dur="3.24">contact her anymore if she&amp;#39;s going to go</text>
  <text start="217.44" dur="3.21">to this lengths of you know going to law</text>
  <text start="219.18" dur="3.51">against me I don&amp;#39;t want anything to do</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="3.72">with her but after praying and after</text>
  <text start="222.69" dur="3.24">talking to my friends I realized I did</text>
  <text start="224.37" dur="4.05">need to fight this I need to object to</text>
  <text start="225.93" dur="5.13">it not because I wanted to to be able to</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="4.59">legally contact her again but because I</text>
  <text start="231.06" dur="3.329">needed to stand for the truth and there</text>
  <text start="233.01" dur="5.4">were several things she&amp;#39;d put in her</text>
  <text start="234.389" dur="6.57">petition that were just lies so I i did</text>
  <text start="238.41" dur="3.9">go and i asked for a hearing to contest</text>
  <text start="240.959" dur="4.11">it and that hearing was set for</text>
  <text start="242.31" dur="7.38">yesterday was set for the 31st of</text>
  <text start="245.069" dur="6.75">december and at this hearing both this</text>
  <text start="249.69" dur="5.31">person and myself had to present</text>
  <text start="251.819" dur="5.491">evidence she had to present evidence as</text>
  <text start="255" dur="5.4">to why she felt that the stocking order</text>
  <text start="257.31" dur="5.55">should be indefinitely put into a</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="3.99">permanent stocking order and then i had</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="3.68">to present evidence that said no that</text>
  <text start="264.39" dur="6.06">this this should be dismissed</text>
  <text start="266.54" dur="5.8">um and as I began to reflect on on that</text>
  <text start="270.45" dur="3.36">court date and on what happened I really</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="5.01">I really believe that this is sort of a</text>
  <text start="273.81" dur="6.42">contest between her God which allows</text>
  <text start="277.35" dur="4.68">eating unclean foods I mean she had just</text>
  <text start="280.23" dur="3.84">posted on her blog about eating this big</text>
  <text start="282.03" dur="3.69">bowl of shrimp celebrating Christmas</text>
  <text start="284.07" dur="3.72">violating the Sabbath all these things</text>
  <text start="285.72" dur="3.69">that I believe were wrong and that you</text>
  <text start="287.79" dur="3.06">know yah had tried to introduce to her</text>
  <text start="289.41" dur="5.61">not just through me but through others</text>
  <text start="290.85" dur="6.15">before me as well and it was a contest</text>
  <text start="295.02" dur="3.93">between her God and then my God my God</text>
  <text start="297" dur="4.32">who is really not my god but the God of</text>
  <text start="298.95" dur="4.77">I mean he is my god but he&amp;#39;s also the</text>
  <text start="301.32" dur="4.98">God of the Bible who requires us to obey</text>
  <text start="303.72" dur="4.949">Torah to put away these unclean foods to</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="4.56">follow the dietary laws to keep the Holy</text>
  <text start="308.669" dur="4.261">feasts and reject the pagan holidays</text>
  <text start="310.86" dur="3.99">like Christmas and Easter and to keep</text>
  <text start="312.93" dur="4.02">the Sabbath holy and to walk in his ways</text>
  <text start="314.85" dur="4.44">the ancient past that gives rest to our</text>
  <text start="316.95" dur="4.35">souls and I believe that this court date</text>
  <text start="319.29" dur="5.189">was a contest between her God and mine</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="6.63">and i won I actually won the judge</text>
  <text start="324.479" dur="6.121">dismissed the stocking order and and did</text>
  <text start="327.93" dur="5.22">not make it permanent he basically told</text>
  <text start="330.6" dur="4.86">this person that she did not prove that</text>
  <text start="333.15" dur="5.55">I was a danger to her or that I had</text>
  <text start="335.46" dur="7.62">committed a stocking act and so it was</text>
  <text start="338.7" dur="7.05">dismissed and I actually won and um so</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="4.98">now I mean now I&amp;#39;m legally able to</text>
  <text start="345.75" dur="4.65">contact her but of course I I won&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="348.06" dur="3.96">I have no intention of doing so because</text>
  <text start="350.4" dur="3.9">that was not the point the point was to</text>
  <text start="352.02" dur="3.899">stand for the truth and and to clear my</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="5.07">name and to stand against the lies that</text>
  <text start="355.919" dur="5.011">this person had had told about me and</text>
  <text start="359.37" dur="2.85">about the nature of our relationship and</text>
  <text start="360.93" dur="6.239">and even the nature of the breakup I</text>
  <text start="362.22" dur="6.78">felt like she was not being honest or at</text>
  <text start="367.169" dur="6.631">least I did not believe her perception</text>
  <text start="369" dur="6">was accurate in any case I&amp;#39;m sharing</text>
  <text start="373.8" dur="3.15">this testimony because i want to</text>
  <text start="375" dur="3.389">encourage those of you out there who if</text>
  <text start="376.95" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;re going through struggles maybe it</text>
  <text start="378.389" dur="3.181">doesn&amp;#39;t involve courts but you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="3.78">through struggles where you&amp;#39;re not sure</text>
  <text start="381.57" dur="5.849">if you can really trust in yah or stand</text>
  <text start="384.33" dur="5.82">for the truth do so because just like in</text>
  <text start="387.419" dur="5.25">my case yah stood for me and he fought</text>
  <text start="390.15" dur="6.12">this battle and he let the truth be</text>
  <text start="392.669" dur="4.951">known and and I was vindicated and I was</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="3.54">able to walk out of that courthouse</text>
  <text start="397.62" dur="4.65">where I had in the past suffered so many</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="5.37">defeats I finally was able to walk out</text>
  <text start="402.27" dur="4.38">of that courthouse in victory and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="405.18" dur="3.66">a huge deal for me because like I said</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="4.74">at the beginning of his podcast I I</text>
  <text start="408.84" dur="4.02">hated Clackamas County Courthouse I mean</text>
  <text start="411.39" dur="4.08">it just it represented everything that</text>
  <text start="412.86" dur="4.71">was wrong in my life and now I finally</text>
  <text start="415.47" dur="5.67">could look at that courthouse and smile</text>
  <text start="417.57" dur="4.95">and an invictre II so yah will stand</text>
  <text start="421.14" dur="2.64">with you if you&amp;#39;re faithful to live holy</text>
  <text start="422.52" dur="3.45">and your faithful to walk in his</text>
  <text start="423.78" dur="3.9">Commandments and obey Him and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="425.97" dur="3.96">standing for his truth he will vindicate</text>
  <text start="427.68" dur="4.5">you he will protect you he will guard</text>
  <text start="429.93" dur="4.979">you and again I&amp;#39;m not making this video</text>
  <text start="432.18" dur="4.14">to make fun of the person who brought</text>
  <text start="434.909" dur="4.201">the stock murder against me in fact I</text>
  <text start="436.32" dur="4.74">still pray for her I hope that that she</text>
  <text start="439.11" dur="5.34">realizes that she&amp;#39;s serving a false god</text>
  <text start="441.06" dur="5.039">she&amp;#39;s serving a Jesus made in in her own</text>
  <text start="444.45" dur="3.899">image and a Jesus that allows her to</text>
  <text start="446.099" dur="5.851">break the scriptures and that she will</text>
  <text start="448.349" dur="5.461">not be able to walk in blessing or in in</text>
  <text start="451.95" dur="3.6">in the things that God has for as long</text>
  <text start="453.81" dur="3.84">as she continues to serve a false god</text>
  <text start="455.55" dur="4.32">which is the God that she&amp;#39;s serving the</text>
  <text start="457.65" dur="3.54">God that her church service serves which</text>
  <text start="459.87" dur="3.06">is a false god oh god that allows</text>
  <text start="461.19" dur="4.37">rebellion and disobedience to the word</text>
  <text start="462.93" dur="4.859">if you&amp;#39;re going to disobey his word and</text>
  <text start="465.56" dur="5.409">especially in her case if you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="467.789" dur="5.521">introduced to the precepts of that word</text>
  <text start="470.969" dur="5.551">which she had been at least through me</text>
  <text start="473.31" dur="6.09">and one other person and you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="476.52" dur="4.86">reject that God is not going to bless</text>
  <text start="479.4" dur="5.639">you he&amp;#39;s not gonna bless you and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.38" dur="5.4">not going to stand with you you can try</text>
  <text start="485.039" dur="3.211">to convince yourself that he&amp;#39;s standing</text>
  <text start="486.78" dur="2.49">with you you can try to lie to yourself</text>
  <text start="488.25" dur="3.24">and lose out but you will be miserable</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="3.6">and you&amp;#39;ll be fighting against him and</text>
  <text start="491.49" dur="3.239">fighting against the plan the dance for</text>
  <text start="492.87" dur="3.479">your life until you align with his</text>
  <text start="494.729" dur="3.481">warden his precepts oh I do pray for her</text>
  <text start="496.349" dur="3.241">and I pray that she will eventually do</text>
  <text start="498.21" dur="4.47">that because right now I think she&amp;#39;s on</text>

  <text start="508.68" dur="5.039">look bad I&amp;#39;m just simply laying out the</text>
