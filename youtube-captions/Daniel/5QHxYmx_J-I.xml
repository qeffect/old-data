  <text start="2.37" dur="5.1">tour restoration ministries it is july</text>
  <text start="4.14" dur="4.62">the six evening going into the we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="7.47" dur="3.209">the twentieth day of the fourth month</text>
  <text start="8.76" dur="3.15">going to the twenty first day second day</text>
  <text start="10.679" dur="3.991">of the week going to the third day the</text>
  <text start="11.91" dur="4.08">week here and I wanted to make it just</text>
  <text start="14.67" dur="3.3">another quick video because I&amp;#39;ve just</text>
  <text start="15.99" dur="4.76">I&amp;#39;ve made just a bunch of videos in the</text>
  <text start="17.97" dur="7.41">last week or two on Daniel seven weeks</text>
  <text start="20.75" dur="5.8">the timelines Daniels 70th week and a</text>
  <text start="25.38" dur="2.309">lot of people been saying Daniel you</text>
  <text start="26.55" dur="3.03">know how can you say all these things</text>
  <text start="27.689" dur="4.351">because we&amp;#39;ve never heard this before</text>
  <text start="29.58" dur="4.83">you know particularly the idea that</text>
  <text start="32.04" dur="4.769">Daniels 70th and final week that</text>
  <text start="34.41" dur="4.35">seven-year period is divided into two</text>
  <text start="36.809" dur="3.66">three and a half periods and those two</text>
  <text start="38.76" dur="6.09">three and a half peers are separated by</text>
  <text start="40.469" dur="6.09">a time gap of 2,000 years well I want to</text>
  <text start="44.85" dur="6.29">just point out some scriptural</text>
  <text start="46.559" dur="6.781">principles about why I think why I think</text>
  <text start="51.14" dur="5.65">you know</text>
  <text start="53.34" dur="5.13">this is this is true there are some</text>
  <text start="56.79" dur="3.75">structural principles for why I think my</text>
  <text start="58.47" dur="4.23">timeline in my theory that Dino 70 the</text>
  <text start="60.54" dur="4.65">final week is divided down the middle by</text>
  <text start="62.7" dur="4.2">two thousand years number one Daniel</text>
  <text start="65.19" dur="4.289">references a seven-year period as the</text>
  <text start="66.9" dur="4.77">final week of Daniels 70 weeks after the</text>
  <text start="69.479" dur="4.441">first 69 weeks are fulfilled everyone</text>
  <text start="71.67" dur="4.35">agrees on that but the book of</text>
  <text start="73.92" dur="4.32">Revelation makes absolutely no reference</text>
  <text start="76.02" dur="4.26">to a seven-year period only a three and</text>
  <text start="78.24" dur="4.08">a half year period over and over again</text>
  <text start="80.28" dur="3.99">and again I challenge you go read the</text>
  <text start="82.32" dur="4.1">book of Revelation you&amp;#39;ll see three and</text>
  <text start="84.27" dur="5.459">a half years 42 months 1260 days</text>
  <text start="86.42" dur="5.11">mentioned over and over again but you</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="4.92">will not see any mention of a seven-year</text>
  <text start="91.53" dur="4.199">period this is because the first three</text>
  <text start="94.649" dur="3.391">and a half years of that seven-year</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="3.871">period had already been completed by</text>
  <text start="98.04" dur="3.63">Yahshua during his three and a half year</text>
  <text start="99.6" dur="4.56">ministry in the Gospels that is the most</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="4.32">logical reason for this so again there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="104.16" dur="2.97">a seven-year printed in Daniel there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="3.39">only a three and a half year period in</text>
  <text start="107.13" dur="3.989">Revelation what happens between Dan and</text>
  <text start="109.38" dur="5.04">revelation is the Gospels where that</text>
  <text start="111.119" dur="5.61">first 39 years are fulfilled so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="7.229">the first principle the second one the</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="7.53">year 17 is a jubilee and the year yosh</text>
  <text start="121.649" dur="4.291">was crucified as evidenced by a major</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="4.14">earthquake in the area recorded by</text>
  <text start="125.94" dur="3.69">planning there is no other earthquake in</text>
  <text start="128.399" dur="3.81">the first half of the first century</text>
  <text start="129.63" dur="5.15">that&amp;#39;s recorded anywhere near the Middle</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="5.041">East except by pliny in the year 17</text>
  <text start="134.78" dur="5.5">Yahshua of course died on the cross and</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="4.92">the major earthquake in suit so a lot of</text>
  <text start="140.28" dur="4.58">strong historical evidence that 17 is</text>
  <text start="142.17" dur="5.52">the year number three this would make</text>
  <text start="144.86" dur="4.78">1967 and Jubilee number jubblies</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="4.14">happened in for 50 years this is when</text>
  <text start="149.64" dur="5.42">the Jews we take Jerusalem and of course</text>
  <text start="151.83" dur="5.96">makes 2017 a jubilant</text>
  <text start="155.06" dur="4.289">number four mirror images are found all</text>
  <text start="157.79" dur="3.33">through Scripture even the menorah is a</text>
  <text start="159.349" dur="3.451">mirror of itself you have three</text>
  <text start="161.12" dur="4.26">candlesticks against three candlesticks</text>
  <text start="162.8" dur="4.439">with a middle servant candle perfect</text>
  <text start="165.38" dur="4.469">mirror is shown in Daniels 70th week</text>
  <text start="167.239" dur="5.461">when a jubilee year ends the first three</text>
  <text start="169.849" dur="4.86">and a half year period in 1780 and a</text>
  <text start="172.7" dur="6.83">jubilee year begins the last we and half</text>
  <text start="174.709" dur="8.341">year period in two thousand 1780</text>
  <text start="179.53" dur="5.56">principle number five Yahshua beginning</text>
  <text start="183.05" dur="3.99">his ministry and thirteen ad and ending</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="3.709">in seventeen eighty fits perfectly with</text>
  <text start="187.04" dur="3.75">several known historical facts</text>
  <text start="188.799" dur="4.031">harmonizing the first six and a half</text>
  <text start="190.79" dur="5.37">weeks of Daniel with a recorded secular</text>
  <text start="192.83" dur="6.31">history and I prove that my Daniel 70</text>
  <text start="196.16" dur="5.26">weeks timeline corrected</text>
  <text start="199.14" dur="4.35">then I have my overall timeline i made a</text>
  <text start="201.42" dur="4.77">video that tonight which is from adam</text>
  <text start="203.49" dur="6.24">till 2020 has several points that make</text>
  <text start="206.19" dur="4.8">it true for instance it has the 430</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="3.6">years of the children of Israel in Egypt</text>
  <text start="210.99" dur="4.14">it has the 300 years from the entrance</text>
  <text start="213.33" dur="4.35">to the promised land till judge Japheth</text>
  <text start="215.13" dur="3.84">and it has 480 years from the 4th care</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="3.87">of Solomon&amp;#39;s reign back toward the</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="5.82">exodus so my timeline fulfills all three</text>
  <text start="221.55" dur="6.09">of those scriptures number 7 my overall</text>
  <text start="224.79" dur="6.24">timeline the one from Adam till 2020 has</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="5.31">earmarks of truth such as Manasseh the</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="6.39">most wicked King ever starting his reign</text>
  <text start="232.95" dur="5.85">in 666 bc such as the 70-year exile</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="3.93">beginning with the temples destruction</text>
  <text start="238.8" dur="5.04">and ending with temple foundation being</text>
  <text start="241.35" dur="4.56">laid such as the fourth year of Solomon</text>
  <text start="243.84" dur="4.56">when he starts building a temple falling</text>
  <text start="245.91" dur="6.09">in a jubilee year so i think these seven</text>
  <text start="248.4" dur="6.45">principles here are very much proof</text>
  <text start="252" dur="5.769">positive evidence that my theory is</text>
  <text start="254.85" dur="6.96">correct and that my timeline is correct</text>
  <text start="257.769" dur="7.041">alright the websites www.scribd.com</text>
