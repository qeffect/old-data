  <text start="70.02" dur="6.27">question are we not supposed to be like</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="5.581">Joshua are we not supposed to emulate</text>
  <text start="76.29" dur="5.07">our Savior what is a disciple of the</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="6.029">Messiah but one who sits at the feet of</text>
  <text start="81.36" dur="9.27">his master and then emulates what that</text>

  <text start="102.63" dur="6.989">one thing you are never ever ever</text>
  <text start="106.46" dur="6.189">supposed to sell the word of Yahweh for</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="6.03">personal gain show me one scripture</text>
  <text start="112.649" dur="5.22">where any of the Apostles received</text>
  <text start="115.649" dur="6.36">revelation from Yahweh and then sold it</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="5.761">to the Sheep sold it to believers show</text>
  <text start="122.009" dur="4.261">me one scripture in the Tanakh where any</text>
  <text start="123.63" dur="7.049">of the prophets received revelation from</text>
  <text start="126.27" dur="7.59">Yahweh and then sold it in fact the only</text>
  <text start="130.679" dur="5.701">example I can think of of someone who</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="5.73">received supposed relation and sold it</text>
  <text start="136.38" dur="5.93">is Simon the sorcerer all of these</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="6.33">teachers Michael roots Scott dryer and</text>
  <text start="142.31" dur="8.59">drew Gabriel Roth all the ones i listed</text>
  <text start="145.92" dur="7.74">nehemia Gordon they sell what supposedly</text>
  <text start="150.9" dur="6.42">they received from Yahweh the revelation</text>
  <text start="153.66" dur="7.5">they got they sell for money its</text>
  <text start="157.32" dur="6.09">wickedness if Yahshua were here today he</text>
  <text start="161.16" dur="5.01">would take his whip and cleanse the</text>
  <text start="163.41" dur="5.43">temple everything on my website</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="5.43">everything I teach everything I create I</text>
  <text start="168.84" dur="4.35">give it away for free if people want to</text>
  <text start="171.6" dur="3.84">send me donations that&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="173.19" dur="4.26">prerogative but I give it for free</text>
  <text start="175.44" dur="4.47">freely I&amp;#39;ve received and freely I give</text>
  <text start="177.45" dur="7.02">and that should be what a true teacher</text>
  <text start="179.91" dur="6.66">does people have also been questioning</text>
  <text start="184.47" dur="5.19">this whole false tree gathering in the</text>
  <text start="186.57" dur="5.04">to house doctrine let it be clear I do</text>
  <text start="189.66" dur="4.71">believe in the to house doctrine there</text>
  <text start="191.61" dur="5.31">is a house of F regime and a house of</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="7.02">Yehuda there is a house of Israel and a</text>
  <text start="196.92" dur="6.93">house of Yehuda but the teachers that</text>
  <text start="201.39" dur="5.159">are teaching what is supposedly the to</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="4.65">aus doctrine is twisted if you want to</text>
  <text start="206.549" dur="3.72">know what the true regathering of the</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="4.5">two houses of Israel will be I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="210.269" dur="4.951">to post a link to this video that will</text>
  <text start="213" dur="5.13">show you what the true regathering is</text>
  <text start="215.22" dur="4.35">all about and it&amp;#39;s very scriptural there</text>
  <text start="218.13" dur="4.609">are so many scriptures that are used</text>
  <text start="219.57" dur="5.01">you&amp;#39;ll be hard pressed to refute it in</text>
  <text start="222.739" dur="3.911">fact there&amp;#39;s a ministry that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.58" dur="4.59">completely unrelated to mine it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="226.65" dur="5.46">followers of yo calm and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="229.17" dur="4.68">also post a link to a very special video</text>
  <text start="232.11" dur="3.93">series they came out with a few years</text>
  <text start="233.85" dur="4.56">ago called the false Armageddon and they</text>
  <text start="236.04" dur="4.259">very clearly talk about what the true</text>
  <text start="238.41" dur="3.54">regathering and the well they mainly</text>
  <text start="240.299" dur="4.621">center on the false regathering what</text>
  <text start="241.95" dur="7.11">that is all about they also make a very</text>
  <text start="244.92" dur="7.26">interesting point it is just as much</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="5.76">Antichrist for a Christian to say he</text>
  <text start="252.18" dur="5.64">loves Yahshua but does not keep Torah as</text>
  <text start="254.82" dur="6.72">it is for a Jew to say that he keeps</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="5.25">Torah but denies Yahshua you see Joshua</text>
  <text start="261.54" dur="2.91">told the Pharisees and Sadducees in the</text>
  <text start="263.07" dur="3.34">first century he said you know because</text>
  <text start="264.45" dur="5.98">you claim that you see</text>
  <text start="266.41" dur="6.87">and yet you still sin you&amp;#39;re truly blind</text>
  <text start="270.43" dur="5.76">you don&amp;#39;t see it all mahan me and Gordon</text>
  <text start="273.28" dur="6.69">claims he sees he claims he sees the</text>
  <text start="276.19" dur="6.42">true Yahshua not this Greek pagan one</text>
  <text start="279.97" dur="9.62">and yet he still refuses to serve the</text>
  <text start="282.61" dur="9.57">master it&amp;#39;s an abomination I visited a</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="5.95">messianic congregation here in the</text>
  <text start="292.18" dur="5.67">Portland area for a few weeks and then</text>
  <text start="295.54" dur="5.16">at one point the wife of the pastor</text>
  <text start="297.85" dur="5.22">approached me and she said Daniel you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.7" dur="6.39">too confident you&amp;#39;re too sure of</text>
  <text start="303.07" dur="6.24">yourself doesn&amp;#39;t the scriptures say</text>
  <text start="307.09" dur="4.32">something about how the spirits of</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="6.9">Darkness will peep and mutter but the</text>
  <text start="311.41" dur="6.9">righteous are as bold as a lion if you</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="5.3">asked me the Messianic movement needs</text>
  <text start="318.31" dur="6.92">more authority and not this Jezebel gray</text>
  <text start="321.51" dur="6.25">misty confusion that seems to cloud it</text>
  <text start="325.23" dur="4.75">now to give you some assurance of what</text>
  <text start="327.76" dur="4.98">I&amp;#39;m teaching and speaking and again</text>
  <text start="329.98" dur="5.31">everything I say you should compare to</text>
  <text start="332.74" dur="6.5">the word of Yahweh I would require no</text>
  <text start="335.29" dur="8.31">less be aburian I wrote an article in</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="8.62">2010 I&amp;#39;m certain that Yahshua is going</text>
  <text start="343.6" dur="7.41">to return on Yom through 2017 and if</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="5.49">that is true than the 2300 days spoken</text>
  <text start="351.01" dur="6.15">of in daniel chapter 8 would have had to</text>
  <text start="353.35" dur="5.7">occur on june fifth 2011 i wrote about</text>
  <text start="357.16" dur="4.86">this in 2010 and i&amp;#39;m on a link to that</text>
  <text start="359.05" dur="5.43">article i&amp;#39;m also going to link to a</text>
  <text start="362.02" dur="6.03">video and article that confirms that</text>
  <text start="364.48" dur="5.46">that prophecy i made came to pass a year</text>
  <text start="368.05" dur="5.91">later after i wrote that article on june</text>
  <text start="369.94" dur="6.27">fifth 2011 the relations between Syria</text>
  <text start="373.96" dur="4.62">and Israel exploded in a way that hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="7.98">happened in 38 years I&amp;#39;m going to post</text>
  <text start="378.58" dur="7.62">all that at the link i also prophesied</text>
  <text start="384.19" dur="6.27">and predicted in 2010 that the dollar</text>
  <text start="386.2" dur="9.63">would collapse in 2011 and what happened</text>
  <text start="390.46" dur="9.54">in 2011 for the first time ever major</text>
  <text start="395.83" dur="6.62">nations Russia China India and Iran</text>
  <text start="400" dur="5.82">all agreed not to use the dollar anymore</text>
  <text start="402.45" dur="5.85">another thing happened in 2011 for the</text>
  <text start="405.82" dur="7.08">first time in our nation&amp;#39;s history our</text>
  <text start="408.3" dur="7.33">debt exceeded our national GDP the</text>
  <text start="412.9" dur="4.89">dollar collapsed now we haven&amp;#39;t seen the</text>
  <text start="415.63" dur="5.07">full manifestations of that yet but it</text>
  <text start="417.79" dur="6.54">did collapse and in fact the white horse</text>
  <text start="420.7" dur="5.73">the black horse and the fifth seal they</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="5.9">all began in 2011 and will continue to</text>
  <text start="426.43" dur="8.94">intest intensify until we reach 2017</text>
  <text start="430.23" dur="7.12">there was a man many years ago name was</text>
  <text start="435.37" dur="4.73">Paul de Perry he was an activist here in</text>
  <text start="437.35" dur="5.46">Portland that protested abortion clinics</text>
  <text start="440.1" dur="5.23">was very pro-life and a good friend of</text>
  <text start="442.81" dur="5.27">mine when I started getting into the</text>
  <text start="445.33" dur="5.82">Hebrew roots and Torah movement in 2001</text>
  <text start="448.08" dur="4.69">unfortunately he opposed me in fact he</text>
  <text start="451.15" dur="3.72">tried to undermine a revival that was</text>
  <text start="452.77" dur="3.57">going on not only in my heart but in the</text>
  <text start="454.87" dur="2.85">hearts of many who were coming to my</text>
  <text start="456.34" dur="4.05">house on a regular basis and we were</text>
  <text start="457.72" dur="4.47">having prayer meetings and preaching and</text>
  <text start="460.39" dur="4.47">with great grief i finally went to him</text>
  <text start="462.19" dur="4.02">and i prophesied to him i used the very</text>
  <text start="464.86" dur="3.66">words that were given to the fifth</text>
  <text start="466.21" dur="4.95">assembly in Revelation Sardis that he</text>
  <text start="468.52" dur="4.86">had a reputation for being alive but he</text>
  <text start="471.16" dur="5.61">was dead and I told him that if he</text>
  <text start="473.38" dur="5.43">didn&amp;#39;t repent but Yahweh would come upon</text>
  <text start="476.77" dur="5.85">him in a day an hour he did not know and</text>
  <text start="478.81" dur="6.27">he would perish five and a half years</text>
  <text start="482.62" dur="5.58">later five and five again for the fifth</text>
  <text start="485.08" dur="6.42">assembly exactly five and a half years</text>
  <text start="488.2" dur="6.21">later in late May 2006 as he was</text>
  <text start="491.5" dur="6.24">violating the Sabbath he suddenly died</text>
  <text start="494.41" dur="5.61">of a heart attack I did not rejoice that</text>
  <text start="497.74" dur="6.63">he died but like David who mourned over</text>
  <text start="500.02" dur="6.72">Saul I was in great grief do you think I</text>
  <text start="504.37" dur="5.67">rejoice that these teachers I&amp;#39;ve listed</text>
  <text start="506.74" dur="6.38">are in wickedness of course not that</text>
  <text start="510.04" dur="7.17">would be so rejoicing if they repented</text>
  <text start="513.12" dur="10.02">and I will mourn if they die in their</text>
  <text start="517.21" dur="9.54">wickedness but the truth must be exalted</text>
  <text start="523.14" dur="4.99">Yahshua said that all that men try to</text>
  <text start="526.75" dur="2.17">hide in darkness will be brought to</text>
  <text start="528.13" dur="3.44">light</text>
