  <text start="2.85" dur="5.13">with tort restoration ministries and</text>
  <text start="4.56" dur="6.45">this podcast is titled irrefutable proof</text>
  <text start="7.98" dur="6.15">that dinosaurs existed thousands of</text>
  <text start="11.01" dur="6.269">years ago and coexisted with man not</text>
  <text start="14.13" dur="5.6">millions of years ago like the modern</text>
  <text start="17.279" dur="4.951">day macro evolutionists want to suggest</text>
  <text start="19.73" dur="5.59">there was a scientist his name is Mark</text>
  <text start="22.23" dur="6.09">Armitage and he was at a dig at Hell</text>
  <text start="25.32" dur="5.85">Creek Formation in Montana and he came</text>
  <text start="28.32" dur="5.579">upon the largest Triceratops horn ever</text>
  <text start="31.17" dur="4.44">unearthed of the site and when he was</text>
  <text start="33.899" dur="5.041">examining the horn under a high-powered</text>
  <text start="35.61" dur="6.719">microscope back at California State</text>
  <text start="38.94" dur="8.22">University Northridge Armitage was</text>
  <text start="42.329" dur="6.57">fascinated to see soft tissue of course</text>
  <text start="47.16" dur="3.149">this discovery stunned members of the</text>
  <text start="48.899" dur="3.09">scientific community because it</text>
  <text start="50.309" dur="3.511">indicates that dinosaurs roamed the</text>
  <text start="51.989" dur="4.59">earth only thousands of years ago in the</text>
  <text start="53.82" dur="8.219">past rather than going extinct 60</text>
  <text start="56.579" dur="8.55">million years ago this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="62.039" dur="5.341">amazing this guy&amp;#39;s that he&amp;#39;s a published</text>
  <text start="65.129" dur="5.251">scientist of over 30 years he was</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="5.61">working at CSU and Northridge of course</text>
  <text start="70.38" dur="5.21">he was recently let go and fired because</text>
  <text start="72.99" dur="4.71">when he presented this evidence</text>
  <text start="75.59" dur="4.779">according to court documents a</text>
  <text start="77.7" dur="4.83">university official challenged the</text>
  <text start="80.369" dur="3.781">motives of Armitage and said we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="82.53" dur="4.46">going to tolerate your religion in this</text>
  <text start="84.15" dur="6.39">department and he was let go and now</text>
  <text start="86.99" dur="5.5">Armitage is suing California State</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="4.02">University Northridge I&amp;#39;m going to put a</text>
  <text start="92.49" dur="5.879">link to that story I&amp;#39;m also going to put</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="7.11">a link to his video that where he shows</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="4.621">the soft tissue he has some some blood</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="4.229">cells actually that he shows under the</text>
  <text start="102.99" dur="5.699">microscope from this fossil of the</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="5.491">triceratops horn folks there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="6.331">soft tissue would exist on this dinosaur</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="5.49">horn if it was 60 million years ago 65</text>
  <text start="115.02" dur="4.05">million years ago this indicates the</text>
  <text start="116.88" dur="4.29">dinosaurs were around only thousands of</text>
  <text start="119.07" dur="3.899">years ago which is exactly what the</text>
  <text start="121.17" dur="3.479">Bible states if you look at the</text>
  <text start="122.969" dur="3.601">genealogical records in the Bible the</text>
  <text start="124.649" dur="3.75">earth is approximately only six thousand</text>
  <text start="126.57" dur="3.749">years old if you read the book of Job</text>
  <text start="128.399" dur="4.021">you&amp;#39;ll find a description of a dinosaur</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="2.711">at the very end of Jobe compares it to</text>
  <text start="132.42" dur="4.33">the</text>
  <text start="133.03" dur="5.46">tributes of Yahweh and dinosaurs</text>
  <text start="136.75" dur="4.26">coexisted with men thousands of years</text>
  <text start="138.49" dur="5.04">ago I remember I would preach this at</text>
  <text start="141.01" dur="4.5">PSU and students would mock me and so</text>
  <text start="143.53" dur="3.9">dinner you&amp;#39;re so silly you&amp;#39;re so crazy</text>
  <text start="145.51" dur="3.96">believing these fairy tales the</text>
  <text start="147.43" dur="4.17">dinosaurs coexisted with men thousands</text>
  <text start="149.47" dur="6.42">of years ago and now we have the</text>
  <text start="151.6" dur="7.05">scientific proof hard clad ironclad</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="4.71">irrefutable proof that dinosaurs existed</text>
  <text start="158.65" dur="4.5">only thousand years ago because they</text>
  <text start="160.6" dur="7.2">discovered this soft tissue in a</text>
  <text start="163.15" dur="7.26">dinosaur horn hallelujah so more</text>
  <text start="167.8" dur="5.28">irrefutable proof that the evolutionists</text>
  <text start="170.41" dur="5.31">they are driven by mythology by a</text>
  <text start="173.08" dur="4.47">selfishness to deny yawn and to not want</text>
  <text start="175.72" dur="3.96">to serve Jesus Christ of Nazareth they</text>
  <text start="177.55" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t want to serve Yahshua they have a</text>
  <text start="179.68" dur="4.529">motive of wanting to live selfishly and</text>
  <text start="181.9" dur="4.919">to live selfishly you have to deny that</text>
  <text start="184.209" dur="3.81">there is a god and to the ninth heirs of</text>
  <text start="186.819" dur="3.241">God they had constructed this whole</text>
  <text start="188.019" dur="4.381">mythology of evolution where they say</text>
  <text start="190.06" dur="4.47">dinosaurs existed 65 million years ago</text>
  <text start="192.4" dur="5.88">and they&amp;#39;ve been extinct since then when</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="5.34">the evidence says just the opposite so</text>
  <text start="198.28" dur="4.679">once more we see that there is</text>
  <text start="199.87" dur="6.3">irrefutable proof that the Bible is in</text>
