  <text start="325.48" dur="9.42">right here on April 24-17 siiii right</text>
  <text start="331.15" dur="10.02">there palm Shabbat it was 10 then we</text>

  <text start="345.13" dur="2.88">night against the fourteenth of Aviv</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="4.14">because here&amp;#39;s the 42 degrees Wednesday</text>
  <text start="348.01" dur="7.05">so tuesday night this is when Yahshua</text>
  <text start="350.77" dur="6.36">and his disciples had their little</text>
  <text start="355.06" dur="5.07">dinner now it wasn&amp;#39;t an actual Passover</text>
  <text start="357.13" dur="4.98">dinner it was the beginning of Passover</text>
  <text start="360.13" dur="3.45">but you know if you notice when you read</text>
  <text start="362.11" dur="2.64">those account they didn&amp;#39;t have a lamb or</text>
  <text start="363.58" dur="3.36">anything they just had the unleavened</text>
  <text start="364.75" dur="3.18">bread and the wine because Yeshua knew</text>
  <text start="366.94" dur="3.6">that he was not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="367.93" dur="4.65">actually keep the Passover Exodus 12</text>
  <text start="370.54" dur="6.26">meal with his disciples because he was</text>
  <text start="372.58" dur="7.44">going to be the Passover lamb sacrificed</text>
  <text start="376.8" dur="4.57">so this is night that that Yasha was</text>
  <text start="380.02" dur="4.98">betrayed they had the Last Supper</text>
  <text start="381.37" dur="7.32">Tuesday night and then we go to</text>
  <text start="385" dur="6.84">wednesday for 28th and this is the day</text>
  <text start="388.69" dur="6.63">that Yahshua was crucified this is the</text>
  <text start="391.84" dur="8">Passover fourteenth of the beef and he</text>
  <text start="395.32" dur="4.52">was crucified on a Wednesday and</text>
  <text start="400.22" dur="4.95">I was severely beaten and scourged and</text>
  <text start="403.19" dur="4.17">he died at three o&amp;#39;clock in the</text>
  <text start="405.17" dur="5.19">afternoon and of course they had to</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="6">quickly take him off the the tree and</text>
  <text start="410.36" dur="5.16">have him buried before this evening</text>
  <text start="413.36" dur="4.35">because this would begin the fifteenth</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="4.14">day of Aviv this would be the first day</text>
  <text start="417.71" dur="4.05">unleavened bread so it&amp;#39;d be a high</text>
  <text start="419.66" dur="4.41">shabbat so they had to get him off and</text>
  <text start="421.76" dur="4.38">bury off the tree and buried before this</text>
  <text start="424.07" dur="3.81">high shabbat begin so he did that now</text>
  <text start="426.14" dur="4.26">remember Yahshua said the Gospels he</text>
  <text start="427.88" dur="4.05">would be in the hearty earth for three</text>
  <text start="430.4" dur="3.06">days and three nights he repeated this</text>
  <text start="431.93" dur="4.26">statement several times throughout the</text>
  <text start="433.46" dur="4.29">Gospels and so do we have three days and</text>
  <text start="436.19" dur="3.78">three nights between when he died and</text>
  <text start="437.75" dur="4.68">rose again well we have wednesday night</text>
  <text start="439.97" dur="4.47">thursday night and friday night so we</text>
  <text start="442.43" dur="4.97">got three nights right there and the</text>
  <text start="444.44" dur="5.55">three days thursday friday and shabbat</text>
  <text start="447.4" dur="4.57">so we got the three nights in the three</text>
  <text start="449.99" dur="4.19">days so that means saturday evening as</text>
  <text start="451.97" dur="5.34">shabbat was ending this is when he rose</text>
  <text start="454.18" dur="5.11">this is when he rose is Shabbat so he</text>
  <text start="457.31" dur="4.88">again it&amp;#39;s not resurrection sunday its</text>
  <text start="459.29" dur="9.39">resurrection Shabbat rose at the end on</text>
  <text start="462.19" dur="10.69">may the first on Shabbat and then on may</text>
  <text start="468.68" dur="6.02">the scent is feast of firstfruits it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.88" dur="4.77">the morrow after the sabbat within the</text>
  <text start="474.7" dur="4.779">seven days of unleavened bread and this</text>
  <text start="477.65" dur="3.69">is the day that the that they discovered</text>
  <text start="479.479" dur="4.141">early in the morning he had been he had</text>
  <text start="481.34" dur="5.07">already risen from the tomb he was out</text>
  <text start="483.62" dur="6.81">of the tomb and this was the the data</text>
  <text start="486.41" dur="6.03">Yahshua rose to the father to pretend</text>
  <text start="490.43" dur="3.93">himself as a first fruit offering his</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="4.82">first food among the dead just as these</text>
  <text start="494.36" dur="6.09">the firstfruits celebrates this is why</text>
  <text start="497.26" dur="6.01">when Miriam found yash or early Sunday</text>
  <text start="500.45" dur="4.29">morning and she wanted to hug him yeah</text>
  <text start="503.27" dur="4.83">sure said don&amp;#39;t touch me for I have not</text>
  <text start="504.74" dur="5.31">yet ascended to my father because in the</text>
  <text start="508.1" dur="4.53">same way the high priest could not be</text>
  <text start="510.05" dur="6.869">touched by anyone until he offered the</text>
  <text start="512.63" dur="9.36">first fruit of the barley harvest before</text>
  <text start="516.919" dur="9.271">the temple so this is the calendar of</text>
  <text start="521.99" dur="6.12">when Yahshua died and rose again this is</text>
  <text start="526.19" dur="7.66">when it actually happened in the year 17</text>
  <text start="528.11" dur="8.9">c e um we use the conjunctive new moon</text>
  <text start="533.85" dur="4.54">okay and the reason we use the</text>
  <text start="537.01" dur="4.62">conjunctive new moon is because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.39" dur="5.16">when the scripture tells us to keep the</text>
  <text start="541.63" dur="4.26">new moon the crescent came from Babylon</text>
  <text start="543.55" dur="4.14">and yes the Jews did start doing the</text>
  <text start="545.89" dur="4.74">crest that when they came out of Babylon</text>
  <text start="547.69" dur="7.38">but bilel not talking about the hall the</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="5.64">4th century but the challah won several</text>
  <text start="555.07" dur="3.12">years before Yahshua&amp;#39;s birth</text>
  <text start="556.27" dur="5.46">reinstituted the conjunctive new moon</text>
  <text start="558.19" dur="5.07">and so the Jewish people were keeping</text>
  <text start="561.73" dur="6.66">the conjunction new moon in the early</text>
  <text start="563.26" dur="10.11">first century so um 1780 is when Yahshua</text>
  <text start="568.39" dur="7.53">died and rose again um and this was a</text>
  <text start="573.37" dur="7.02">jubilee year the year 17 was a doobly</text>
  <text start="575.92" dur="7.08">year Jubilee happens every 50 years so</text>
  <text start="580.39" dur="5.49">if you count forward 15 excuse me 50</text>
  <text start="583" dur="5.64">years you got 17 is the Jubilee than the</text>
  <text start="585.88" dur="6.63">year 67 is a jubilee and then you keep</text>
  <text start="588.64" dur="5.79">going forward 117th of jubilee 167 to 17</text>
  <text start="592.51" dur="4.68">to jubilee 267 you come all the way to</text>
  <text start="594.43" dur="4.86">the 20th century 1967 was a jubilee and</text>
  <text start="597.19" dur="5.25">of course that was the year that the</text>
  <text start="599.29" dur="7.5">Jews retook Jerusalem and of course the</text>
  <text start="602.44" dur="9">next jubilee is 2017 when Yahshua will</text>
  <text start="606.79" dur="7.23">return for his bride hallelujah so this</text>
  <text start="611.44" dur="6.72">is just a short little podcast to show</text>
  <text start="614.02" dur="6.15">everyone when Yahshua died and</text>
