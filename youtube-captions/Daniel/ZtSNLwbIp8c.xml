  <text start="0.469" dur="6.131">hello mrs. Daniel John Lee with Torah</text>
  <text start="3.48" dur="7.05">restoration ministries the website is ww</text>
  <text start="6.6" dur="7.199">spirit and Torah calm and today is my</text>
  <text start="10.53" dur="8.82">midweek podcast and the title today is</text>
  <text start="13.799" dur="8.281">episode 21 the ghost of Marcy on and I</text>
  <text start="19.35" dur="5.97">want to talk about whom RC on was what</text>
  <text start="22.08" dur="6.779">he taught why he was considered a</text>
  <text start="25.32" dur="6.89">heretic in his day and why he&amp;#39;s become</text>
  <text start="28.859" dur="8.521">so influential on the church world today</text>
  <text start="32.21" dur="7.18">Marcy on was a I guess by some</text>
  <text start="37.38" dur="6.78">considered an early church father he</text>
  <text start="39.39" dur="7.77">lived in the 2nd century and in the time</text>
  <text start="44.16" dur="6.66">that he lived most of those identifying</text>
  <text start="47.16" dur="6.289">themselves with belief in Messiah we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="50.82" dur="5.73">still keeping the Torah they were still</text>
  <text start="53.449" dur="7.571">short of what we would think of as messy</text>
  <text start="56.55" dur="8.399">annex or Hebrew Christians Jewish</text>
  <text start="61.02" dur="5.669">Christians they accepted Yahshua Jesus</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="9.111">as the Messiah but they also kept the</text>
  <text start="66.689" dur="12.72">Torah and marcie on was somebody who</text>
  <text start="74.06" dur="8.68">believed that the so-called Old</text>
  <text start="79.409" dur="6.151">Testament God was different from the New</text>
  <text start="82.74" dur="6.6">Testament God in fact prior to Marcy on</text>
  <text start="85.56" dur="5.879">the Old Testament was not called the Old</text>
  <text start="89.34" dur="4.529">Testament that word those words do not</text>
  <text start="91.439" dur="4.381">exist as a label it was simply referred</text>
  <text start="93.869" dur="3.93">to as the Tanakh or as what Yahshua</text>
  <text start="95.82" dur="5.46">referred to it as is the taurah the</text>
  <text start="97.799" dur="8.28">prophets the Psalms or the tour and the</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="7.35">prophets the so-called New Testament was</text>
  <text start="106.079" dur="6.271">called the Brit hadashah which is Hebrew</text>
  <text start="108.63" dur="5.82">for renewed covenant and the reason why</text>
  <text start="112.35" dur="5.25">it was called a renewed covenant is</text>
  <text start="114.45" dur="5.19">because it actually finds its foundation</text>
  <text start="117.6" dur="4.08">in the first covenant so you have the</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="4.619">Mosaic Covenant that was given on Mount</text>
  <text start="121.68" dur="7.59">Sinai and it was this covenant that was</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="6.901">renewed by the blood of Yahshua so the</text>
  <text start="129.27" dur="4.72">Torah was renewed by the blood of</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="4.75">Yahshua which was helpless to understand</text>
  <text start="133.99" dur="4.56">and that the renewed covenant is not</text>
  <text start="135.91" dur="5.76">something that&amp;#39;s brand new but rather</text>
  <text start="138.55" dur="5.3">it&amp;#39;s something that is wholly founded on</text>
  <text start="141.67" dur="4.8">the first covenant and is simply a</text>
  <text start="143.85" dur="8.2">renewal or ratification of that covenant</text>
  <text start="146.47" dur="8.16">by the blood of Yahshua so Marcy on he</text>
  <text start="152.05" dur="4.89">was was very anti-semitic and so he he</text>
  <text start="154.63" dur="4.8">labeled the Tanakh he was the first one</text>
  <text start="156.94" dur="7.41">to label the Tanakh as the Old Testament</text>
  <text start="159.43" dur="7.95">trying to imply that it was old decaying</text>
  <text start="164.35" dur="4.62">and no good and he called the renewed</text>
  <text start="167.38" dur="4.71">covenant the brit had a shot the New</text>
  <text start="168.97" dur="7.05">Testament st. thinking that try to make</text>
  <text start="172.09" dur="5.73">it sound like it was better Marcy I went</text>
  <text start="176.02" dur="5.07">beyond this he taught that the Old</text>
  <text start="177.82" dur="5.4">Testament God was filled with wrath and</text>
  <text start="181.09" dur="6.63">fury but the New Testament God was</text>
  <text start="183.22" dur="8.28">merciful and loving now this can easily</text>
  <text start="187.72" dur="8.37">be refuted just go through Scripture and</text>
  <text start="191.5" dur="6.54">you can find that there are many many</text>
  <text start="196.09" dur="4.53">many hundreds if not thousands of</text>
  <text start="198.04" dur="4.7">examples of ya&amp;#39;s mercy throughout the</text>
  <text start="200.62" dur="4.92">Tanakh particularly in the Psalms and</text>
  <text start="202.74" dur="6.03">you could also find numerous examples of</text>
  <text start="205.54" dur="6.81">Yahshua&amp;#39;s wrath in the renewed covenant</text>
  <text start="208.77" dur="6.22">Yahshua himself in the Gospels he talks</text>
  <text start="212.35" dur="6.69">about and refers to hell Hellfire the</text>
  <text start="214.99" dur="8.28">lake of fire more times than any other</text>
  <text start="219.04" dur="7.95">prophet in the in all the Tanakh so</text>
  <text start="223.27" dur="6.18">clearly his mercy is very evident in the</text>
  <text start="226.99" dur="5.34">so-called Old Testament and his and his</text>
  <text start="229.45" dur="6.15">wrath and judgment is very evident in</text>
  <text start="232.33" dur="4.98">the new so Yahweh does not change he</text>
  <text start="235.6" dur="7.05">says that he is the same yesterday today</text>
  <text start="237.31" dur="7.05">and forever but marcion was not</text>
  <text start="242.65" dur="3.74">interested in the facts but he was</text>
  <text start="244.36" dur="8.12">interested in rejecting the Jewish God</text>
  <text start="246.39" dur="6.09">while promoting his his greco-roman God</text>
  <text start="252.51" dur="5.949">marcion was identified and rejected by</text>
  <text start="255.94" dur="5.669">most believers of his day as a heretic</text>
  <text start="258.459" dur="5.731">so in the second century when he taught</text>
  <text start="261.609" dur="6.391">these things the most assembly is most</text>
  <text start="264.19" dur="6.45">believers did not accept Marcy on as</text>
  <text start="268" dur="7.25">a legitimate teacher and viewed him as a</text>
  <text start="270.64" dur="8.64">as a heretic for his beliefs</text>
  <text start="275.25" dur="8.08">unfortunately the labels old a new</text>
  <text start="279.28" dur="6.21">testament and and his idea that God was</text>
  <text start="283.33" dur="5.31">somehow different from one testament to</text>
  <text start="285.49" dur="6.57">the other that those ideas now flood</text>
  <text start="288.64" dur="5.88">modern-day Christianity um if you pick</text>
  <text start="292.06" dur="4.35">up any Bible they&amp;#39;ve discarded the</text>
  <text start="294.52" dur="4.71">original names of the first to renewed</text>
  <text start="296.41" dur="4.56">covenants you&amp;#39;ll never see it name the</text>
  <text start="299.23" dur="4.59">Tanakh unless you find a Jewish Bible</text>
  <text start="300.97" dur="4.32">and you rarely ever see the New</text>
  <text start="303.82" dur="2.88">Testament called the Brit hadashah or</text>
  <text start="305.29" dur="3.51">the renewed covenant unless you pick up</text>
  <text start="306.7" dur="7.969">a messianic jewish translation like the</text>
  <text start="308.8" dur="8.94">one by by david stern so many people and</text>
  <text start="314.669" dur="5.651">Christians believe God was wrathful in</text>
  <text start="317.74" dur="6.96">the Old Testament but reformed his ways</text>
  <text start="320.32" dur="6.24">into a more merciful better God in the</text>
  <text start="324.7" dur="6.96">New Testament and and this idea pervades</text>
  <text start="326.56" dur="8.669">even the secular world it&amp;#39;s everywhere</text>
  <text start="331.66" dur="7.29">it&amp;#39;s everywhere and it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="335.229" dur="5.431">a lie it&amp;#39;s a complete and total lie and</text>
  <text start="338.95" dur="6.27">actually if you examine the ID on its</text>
  <text start="340.66" dur="8.04">face the the the thesis is is ludicrous</text>
  <text start="345.22" dur="5.22">I mean think about it you read two</text>
  <text start="348.7" dur="5.82">thirds of the Bible which is what the</text>
  <text start="350.44" dur="6.03">Tanakh is and and you read this you read</text>
  <text start="354.52" dur="5.94">this book and you read about this this</text>
  <text start="356.47" dur="6.21">Yahweh and then somehow in the last</text>
  <text start="360.46" dur="4.74">third of the Bible all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="362.68" dur="5.96">Yahweh decides to repent of his nature</text>
  <text start="365.2" dur="6.69">and character and he decides to become a</text>
  <text start="368.64" dur="5.23">different God altogether when that</text>
  <text start="371.89" dur="4.17">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense if that&amp;#39;s who God</text>
  <text start="373.87" dur="4.35">really is if he&amp;#39;s that schizophrenic if</text>
  <text start="376.06" dur="4.01">he changes his character that much I</text>
  <text start="378.22" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t want anything to do with him and</text>
  <text start="380.07" dur="5.29">no thinking individual would want</text>
  <text start="382.66" dur="4.41">anything to do with him it just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="385.36" dur="4.98">make any sense that makes a lot more</text>
  <text start="387.07" dur="5.04">sense that Yahweh is as he said in the</text>
  <text start="390.34" dur="3.93">Tanakh that he is the same yesterday</text>
  <text start="392.11" dur="4.71">today and forever that he does not</text>
  <text start="394.27" dur="7.019">change that his character is steadfast</text>
  <text start="396.82" dur="8.299">and indeed it is that he is merciful he</text>
  <text start="401.289" dur="7.921">is loving but he&amp;#39;s also a consuming fire</text>
  <text start="405.119" dur="7.6">he&amp;#39;s a judge He pours out his wrath on</text>
  <text start="409.21" dur="6.269">the wicked in the center and and this</text>
  <text start="412.719" dur="6.42">has never changed he is the same Yahweh</text>
  <text start="415.479" dur="7.08">that he was over Moses and the tribes of</text>
  <text start="419.139" dur="5.101">Israel as he is today and you know if</text>
  <text start="422.559" dur="3.84">you look at history if you study the</text>
  <text start="424.24" dur="5.099">early church fathers it&amp;#39;s not as if our</text>
  <text start="426.399" dur="4.2">ancestors left us in the dark okay as I</text>
  <text start="429.339" dur="3.6">mentioned earlier the second and third</text>
  <text start="430.599" dur="4.831">century believers roundly rejected</text>
  <text start="432.939" dur="5.19">marcion and those who adopted his</text>
  <text start="435.43" dur="6.269">heresies but what happened is as</text>
  <text start="438.129" dur="7.16">anti-semitism crept into the so-called</text>
  <text start="441.699" dur="7.381">Church world Marci on returned with it</text>
  <text start="445.289" dur="5.92">now today you&amp;#39;ll also find believers who</text>
  <text start="449.08" dur="4.739">do not fall for this common</text>
  <text start="451.209" dur="5.371">misconception okay and they really do</text>
  <text start="453.819" dur="4.921">believe that the God described in the</text>
  <text start="456.58" dur="4.309">so-called Old Testament is the same as</text>
  <text start="458.74" dur="6.81">the God described in the so-called new</text>
  <text start="460.889" dur="6.851">but even amongst those people many of</text>
  <text start="465.55" dur="4.889">them tend to believe that the Old</text>
  <text start="467.74" dur="7.139">Testament has been made obsolete while</text>
  <text start="470.439" dur="7.111">the new one has replaced it that we no</text>
  <text start="474.879" dur="5.34">longer need the commandments and the</text>
  <text start="477.55" dur="5.639">ordinances and the regulations that are</text>
  <text start="480.219" dur="4.74">built into Torah because somehow</text>
  <text start="483.189" dur="4.32">yahshua&amp;#39;s blood has wiped all that away</text>
  <text start="484.959" dur="4.8">he obeyed the commandments so we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="487.509" dur="5.671">have to and that you know that&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="489.759" dur="5.22">strain of marciana heresy and this</text>
  <text start="493.18" dur="4.019">heresy is devastating because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="494.979" dur="7.92">prevented the bride from obeying the</text>
  <text start="497.199" dur="8.96">Torah a shot if we strip away what Marci</text>
  <text start="502.899" dur="6.81">on believed from the church world then</text>
  <text start="506.159" dur="5.86">it becomes very easy to obey the Torah</text>
  <text start="509.709" dur="5.281">as a believer in Messiah that becomes</text>
  <text start="512.019" dur="5.19">very clear because now we have a Bible</text>
  <text start="514.99" dur="4.859">that is unified there&amp;#39;s no dividing</text>
  <text start="517.209" dur="4.98">partition with the title page New</text>
  <text start="519.849" dur="4.651">Testament there is the Tanakh the Torah</text>
  <text start="522.189" dur="4.291">and the prophets and that goes right</text>
  <text start="524.5" dur="4.199">into the renewed covenant we see that</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="6.08">both of these covenants are are tied</text>
  <text start="528.699" dur="6.121">together that they&amp;#39;re inextricably bound</text>
  <text start="532.56" dur="4.18">one to another</text>
  <text start="534.82" dur="4.8">and that the renewed covenant is merely</text>
  <text start="536.74" dur="5.58">a ratification or a renewal of what was</text>
  <text start="539.62" dur="7.05">given on mount sinai by the blood of</text>
  <text start="542.32" dur="6.69">Yahshua the shed blood of Yahshua we</text>
  <text start="546.67" dur="5.55">understand that Yahweh is the same that</text>
  <text start="549.01" dur="6.12">the same demands he placed upon humanity</text>
  <text start="552.22" dur="5.1">in the time of Adam and abra home and</text>
  <text start="555.13" dur="4.8">mow Shey are the same demands that he</text>
  <text start="557.32" dur="5.58">puts upon us today that is the same</text>
  <text start="559.93" dur="6.66">Torah it&amp;#39;s the same commandments it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.9" dur="8.07">the same Yahweh it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="566.59" dur="6.36">a renewed covenant because he wanted to</text>
  <text start="570.97" dur="3.9">have a people in which the spirit would</text>
  <text start="572.95" dur="3.45">be dwelling within them that would teach</text>
  <text start="574.87" dur="5.84">them to walk in His commandments and his</text>
  <text start="576.4" dur="7.05">laws so I hope this short little YouTube</text>
  <text start="580.71" dur="4.09">helped you and do some research on you</text>
  <text start="583.45" dur="3.66">and looked up Marcy on google him and</text>
  <text start="584.8" dur="5.03">you&amp;#39;ll find out more about his heresies</text>
  <text start="587.11" dur="5.72">and why it is important to avoid them</text>
  <text start="589.83" dur="3">shallow</text>
