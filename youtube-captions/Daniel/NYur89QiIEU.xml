  <text start="27.119" dur="9.421">false but this story is true despite the</text>
  <text start="32.88" dur="7.29">assault of trolls I&amp;#39;ve been getting that</text>
  <text start="36.54" dur="5.13">stock photo that was used the tweet</text>
  <text start="40.17" dur="3.45">never said that that was the photo of</text>
  <text start="41.67" dur="5.04">that was the actual photo of Ginsberg&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="43.62" dur="5.43">hearse you need to read the tweet it</text>
  <text start="46.71" dur="3.96">just said that her hearse has been</text>
  <text start="49.05" dur="4.02">spotted and then they used a stock photo</text>
  <text start="50.67" dur="4.35">in the Twitter I&amp;#39;ve gotten several</text>
  <text start="53.07" dur="5.46">verifications of what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="55.02" dur="8.49">not just from while storm is upon us</text>
  <text start="58.53" dur="7.56">posted it as well as this scrub your</text>
  <text start="63.51" dur="4.289">hands a guy but then also there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="6.72">another Twitter guideline of Judah Judah</text>
  <text start="67.799" dur="8.64">strumpet he&amp;#39;s posted several things one</text>
  <text start="72.81" dur="5.43">is from an anon from a marine an ex-army</text>
  <text start="76.439" dur="3.661">relative of mine has a friend who is a</text>

  <text start="82.049" dur="4.261">congressional funeral detail in DC both</text>
  <text start="84.93" dur="3.06">of them have never heard of such a thing</text>
  <text start="86.31" dur="4.769">and are not sure what it means could be</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="5.4">some retired senator has passed or like</text>
  <text start="91.079" dur="5.491">most of us are likely thinking here it</text>
  <text start="93.39" dur="4.68">could be Ruth Bader Ginsburg and then</text>
  <text start="96.57" dur="3.839">somebody reply to that and said I have</text>
  <text start="98.07" dur="4.11">no confirmation of this but I am very</text>
  <text start="100.409" dur="3.57">familiar with procedures of Military</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="3.96">District of Washington DC especially</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="4.111">regarding Marines and funerals this</text>
  <text start="106.14" dur="4.17">would certainly be consistent if one was</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="6.66">imminent they would be receiving advance</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="6.12">notice prior to the public release so if</text>
