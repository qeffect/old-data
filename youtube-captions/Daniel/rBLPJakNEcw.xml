  <text start="5.13" dur="6.66">August the 26 2017 Saturday morning the</text>
  <text start="8.94" dur="6">Sabbath day Shabbat and this is part 15</text>
  <text start="11.79" dur="6.81">of my 17 part series of reconciling the</text>
  <text start="14.94" dur="6.27">teachings of Messiah Yahshua and Apostle</text>
  <text start="18.6" dur="4.47">Paul and this probably will be one of</text>
  <text start="21.21" dur="4.77">the most important teachings of the 17</text>
  <text start="23.07" dur="7.109">parts already the crown jewel of the 17</text>
  <text start="25.98" dur="6.84">parts and this is hebrews chapter 8 what</text>
  <text start="30.179" dur="6.001">is the new covenant what is this new</text>
  <text start="32.82" dur="5.64">covenant so in the last part we saw how</text>
  <text start="36.18" dur="4.74">the mikkel Zadok priesthood is superior</text>
  <text start="38.46" dur="4.009">to the Levitical priesthood doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="40.92" dur="3.869">that that McKell Zadok priesthood</text>
  <text start="42.469" dur="3.551">nullifies or cancels out the Levitical</text>
  <text start="44.789" dur="4.5">priests it just means that it&amp;#39;s superior</text>
  <text start="46.02" dur="5.76">well here we have a new covenant and</text>
  <text start="49.289" dur="5.101">this new covenant is actually a better</text>
  <text start="51.78" dur="5.009">covenant than the first covenant and</text>
  <text start="54.39" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re gonna find out why why is it</text>
  <text start="56.789" dur="5.491">better because that directly ties into</text>
  <text start="58.77" dur="6.9">what this new covenant is alright so</text>
  <text start="62.28" dur="7.65">starting in Hebrews 8 going into verse 7</text>
  <text start="65.67" dur="7.71">for if that first covenant had been</text>
  <text start="69.93" dur="6.24">faultless then should no place have been</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="4.919">sought for the second okay so what was</text>
  <text start="76.17" dur="3.629">there was there was a fault in this</text>
  <text start="78.299" dur="2.911">first covenant what was the fault now</text>
  <text start="79.799" dur="2.64">most Christians will say oh yeah the</text>
  <text start="81.21" dur="3.99">thought was we had to keep all those</text>
  <text start="82.439" dur="4.411">stupid Old Testament laws but that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="3.959">what Hebrews 8 says if you go to the</text>
  <text start="86.85" dur="5.37">next verse it says for finding fault</text>
  <text start="89.159" dur="5.161">with them so he didn&amp;#39;t find fault with</text>
  <text start="92.22" dur="3.06">the commandments he didn&amp;#39;t find fault</text>
  <text start="94.32" dur="3.63">with the tore didn&amp;#39;t find fault with</text>
  <text start="95.28" dur="6.93">himself they found fault with them those</text>
  <text start="97.95" dur="6.66">who were given this covenant he found</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="5.04">fault with them and he says behold the</text>
  <text start="104.61" dur="4.71">days come saith Yahweh when I will make</text>
  <text start="107.25" dur="5.13">a new covenant with the house of Israel</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="5.15">and with the house of Judah so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="112.38" dur="4.11">making it with Israel and Judah not with</text>
  <text start="114.47" dur="4.45">Christians or anything like that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="116.49" dur="3.809">got to be grafted in just like Romans 11</text>
  <text start="118.92" dur="4.47">talks about he&amp;#39;s only making this</text>
  <text start="120.299" dur="5.791">covenant with Israel and Judah and in</text>
  <text start="123.39" dur="3.42">Revelation there&amp;#39;s 12 gates to the New</text>
  <text start="126.09" dur="2.25">Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="126.81" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s no thirteenth gate for</text>
  <text start="128.34" dur="4.86">Christianity or Buddhists or Muslims or</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="4.95">Orthodox Jews there&amp;#39;s 12 gates for the</text>
  <text start="133.2" dur="5.429">Tribes of Israel and we can only be</text>
  <text start="135.45" dur="7.259">grafted in by the blood of Messiah he</text>
  <text start="138.629" dur="6.301">says not according this is verse 9 this</text>
  <text start="142.709" dur="4.11">is also gonna say why he found fault</text>
  <text start="144.93" dur="3.029">with the first covenant not according to</text>
  <text start="146.819" dur="2.971">the Covenant that I made with their</text>
  <text start="147.959" dur="3.571">fathers in the day when I took them by</text>
  <text start="149.79" dur="4.77">the hand to lead them out of the land of</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="5.16">egypt because they continued not in my</text>
  <text start="154.56" dur="4.56">covenant and i regarded them not saith</text>
  <text start="156.69" dur="4.859">yahweh so again he repeats what he says</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="4.229">in verse 8 he finds fault with them why</text>
  <text start="161.549" dur="3.241">because they didn&amp;#39;t obey they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="163.349" dur="3.631">continue in his covenant they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="4.08">continue to walk like he asked them to</text>
  <text start="166.98" dur="3.36">and so he&amp;#39;s like ah this doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="168.87" dur="3.27">again he doesn&amp;#39;t find fault with the</text>
  <text start="170.34" dur="3.03">Torah it doesn&amp;#39;t find fault with the</text>
  <text start="172.14" dur="2.58">commandments that were given he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="3.81">find fault with himself he finds fault</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="7.01">with them because they did not continue</text>
  <text start="177.18" dur="6.75">in his ways now going to verse 10 now</text>
  <text start="181.73" dur="4.93">here&amp;#39;s where we define what the New</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="3.809">Covenant is for this is the Covenant</text>
  <text start="186.66" dur="3.18">that I will make with the house of</text>
  <text start="187.739" dur="5.011">Israel after those days saith Yahweh I</text>
  <text start="189.84" dur="5.22">will put my laws into their mind and</text>
  <text start="192.75" dur="4.29">write them in their hearts and I will be</text>
  <text start="195.06" dur="4.769">to them eh yah and they shall be to me a</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="3.96">people and they shall not teach every</text>
  <text start="199.829" dur="3.481">man his neighbor and every man his</text>
  <text start="201" dur="4.67">brother saying no Yahweh for all shall</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="4.5">know me from the least to the greatest</text>
  <text start="205.67" dur="4.539">for I will be merciful to their</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="5.79">unrighteousness and their sins and their</text>
  <text start="210.209" dur="6.06">iniquities will I remember no more in</text>
  <text start="213.6" dur="4.05">that he saith a new covenant he hath</text>
  <text start="216.269" dur="3.601">made the first old</text>
  <text start="217.65" dur="4.709">now that was decays and waxes old is</text>
  <text start="219.87" dur="5.58">ready to vanish away so this new</text>
  <text start="222.359" dur="5.071">covenant is he takes these laws he takes</text>
  <text start="225.45" dur="3.45">these Commandments and rather than the</text>
  <text start="227.43" dur="4.709">just being written on tablets of stone</text>
  <text start="228.9" dur="4.83">he now puts them within us so this is</text>
  <text start="232.139" dur="3.96">the essence of what the New Covenant is</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="4.47">and by the way all the writer of Hebrews</text>
  <text start="236.099" dur="3.661">8 is doing is quoting directly from</text>
  <text start="238.2" dur="4.619">Jeremiah 31:31</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="6.089">it is it is the exact same verbiage if</text>
  <text start="242.819" dur="5.73">you start reading in Jeremiah 31:31 and</text>
  <text start="245.849" dur="5.76">he&amp;#39;s saying okay so it was written on</text>
  <text start="248.549" dur="4.321">tablets of stone it was given to you are</text>
  <text start="251.609" dur="3.571">these Commandments were given to you</text>
  <text start="252.87" dur="3.929">this Torah was given to you not just the</text>
  <text start="255.18" dur="4.739">Ten Commandments all the commandments</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="4.831">were given to you but I found fault</text>
  <text start="259.919" dur="3.781">because you guys didn&amp;#39;t continue in it</text>
  <text start="261.63" dur="3.84">okay so I&amp;#39;m scratching this and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.7" dur="2.12">gonna do a new and better covenant and</text>

  <text start="286.46" dur="4.2">to steal and not to murder and not to</text>
  <text start="288.89" dur="3.69">not to hate without a cause you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="290.66" dur="4.56">have an inward desire to put on those</text>

  <text start="309.05" dur="5.64">redeem you this is what the New Covenant</text>
  <text start="311.39" dur="6.21">is now I want to point out a few other</text>
  <text start="314.69" dur="6.57">verses because this is directly quoted</text>
  <text start="317.6" dur="5.46">from Ezekiel 31 31 that&amp;#39;s right from</text>
  <text start="321.26" dur="3.06">hesitating here James block just started</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="3.63">his praise and worship and I love</text>
  <text start="324.32" dur="3.51">listening to his live worship if you</text>
  <text start="326.69" dur="3.96">ever get a chance to listen to James</text>
  <text start="327.83" dur="5.22">block he oftentimes will broadcast live</text>
  <text start="330.65" dur="3.63">starting around 10:30 a.m. Pacific time</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="6.63">8:30 p.m.</text>
  <text start="334.28" dur="9">Israel time he just started here okay so</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="5.28">I want to point out a few other verses</text>
  <text start="343.28" dur="3.96">so I said that he quoted directly from</text>
  <text start="344.96" dur="4.71">Jeremiah 31 but also if you go to</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="4.32">Ezekiel he kind of proves what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="349.67" dur="3.92">saying here about what the essence of</text>
  <text start="351.56" dur="6.6">the New Covenant is in Ezekiel chapter</text>
  <text start="353.59" dur="6.43">11 starting in verse 19 he says I will</text>
  <text start="358.16" dur="4.14">give them one heart and I will put a new</text>
  <text start="360.02" dur="3.81">spirit within you and I will take the</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="3">Stoney heart out of their flesh and I</text>
  <text start="363.83" dur="4.56">will give them a heart of flesh that</text>
  <text start="365.3" dur="5.31">they may walk in my statutes and keep</text>
  <text start="368.39" dur="3.57">mine ordinances and do them and they</text>
  <text start="370.61" dur="4.38">shall be my people and I will be their</text>
  <text start="371.96" dur="4.98">yacht so he&amp;#39;s not doing away with the</text>
  <text start="374.99" dur="4.38">Torah folks those statues and those</text>
  <text start="376.94" dur="5.22">organs are still there but now he is</text>
  <text start="379.37" dur="6.03">he&amp;#39;s basically going to cause them to</text>
  <text start="382.16" dur="4.71">walk in those by putting a new spirit</text>
  <text start="385.4" dur="4.74">within them that&amp;#39;s the ruach ha&amp;#39;qodesh</text>
  <text start="386.87" dur="8.08">the holy spirit and if you still don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="390.14" dur="8.65">believe me go to Ezekiel 36</text>
  <text start="394.95" dur="5.61">starting in verse 26 he says a new heart</text>
  <text start="398.79" dur="4.26">also will I give you and a new spirit</text>
  <text start="400.56" dur="4.17">while I put within you and I will take</text>
