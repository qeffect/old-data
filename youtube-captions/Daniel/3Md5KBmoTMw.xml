  <text start="22.38" dur="7.319">during sukkot 2016 because quite frankly</text>
  <text start="25.08" dur="7.38">I was too consumed with fellowship and</text>
  <text start="29.699" dur="5.101">just enjoying the feast so I wasn&amp;#39;t able</text>
  <text start="32.46" dur="4.38">to make any videos which I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="34.8" dur="4.29">to apologize for because I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="36.84" dur="4.44">the way Sukkot should be he should be so</text>
  <text start="39.09" dur="4.68">involved with fellowship and enjoying</text>

  <text start="43.77" dur="6.39">make videos so I didn&amp;#39;t make any videos</text>
  <text start="46.289" dur="7.41">this sukkot but i did want to touch upon</text>
  <text start="50.16" dur="6.329">a teaching that was sent to me during</text>
  <text start="53.699" dur="4.981">sukkot which I it just really really</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="4.921">impacted me quite a bit it was right</text>

  <text start="78.99" dur="3.66">particular lesson right of Sukkot was</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="4.59">ending because I just think it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="82.65" dur="4.55">powerful it&amp;#39;s called the heavenly gaps</text>
  <text start="85.17" dur="4.17">and it says during the feast of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="87.2" dur="4.989">Tabernacles the people dwell in a</text>
  <text start="89.34" dur="5.37">temporary dwelling called a sukkah when</text>
  <text start="92.189" dur="4.351">you build your sukkah you leave gaps so</text>
  <text start="94.71" dur="4.38">that when you sit underneath it you can</text>
  <text start="96.54" dur="5.82">see the sky clouds the moon and stars at</text>
  <text start="99.09" dur="4.739">night in life there are gaps some of</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="3.539">these gaps in your life are actually</text>
  <text start="103.829" dur="6.08">heavenly when you look at what&amp;#39;s missing</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="7.951">money comfort success strength abilities</text>
  <text start="109.909" dur="7.42">friends family marriage health youth</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="5.699">whatever it is it&amp;#39;s not always bad if</text>
  <text start="117.329" dur="3.811">you had everything you wanted if your</text>
  <text start="119.549" dur="3.691">life was a complete dwelling on earth</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="4.86">you wouldn&amp;#39;t need you and you wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="123.24" dur="4.53">see heaven but the very gaps you want</text>
  <text start="126" dur="2.3">clothes are off of there for your own</text>
  <text start="127.77" dur="2.15">good</text>
  <text start="128.3" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re the gaps in the roof of your</text>
  <text start="129.92" dur="4.17">sukkah so you don&amp;#39;t forget the most</text>
  <text start="131.78" dur="3.96">important things they&amp;#39;re there so you</text>
  <text start="134.09" dur="4.68">might see through the earthly things</text>
  <text start="135.74" dur="5.36">which pass away beyond the skies to the</text>
  <text start="138.77" dur="5.07">stars to the heavens to the face of yah</text>
  <text start="141.1" dur="4.93">so rejoice than what you have and</text>

  <text start="152.75" dur="4.02">mission is take time today to reflect on</text>
  <text start="154.7" dur="4.83">how temporary life is in comparison to</text>
  <text start="156.77" dur="5.55">your eternal home in heaven dwell in the</text>
  <text start="159.53" dur="7.35">heavenlies so I to me that&amp;#39;s just really</text>
  <text start="162.32" dur="6.12">really I&amp;#39;d never looked at a sukkah in</text>
  <text start="166.88" dur="3.45">that way before but it&amp;#39;s true you are</text>
  <text start="168.44" dur="3.9">supposed to leave gaps in the roof of</text>
  <text start="170.33" dur="4.11">your sukkah so you can look up and gaze</text>
  <text start="172.34" dur="5.37">at the heavens and see the the stars and</text>
  <text start="174.44" dur="5.55">you know see through the branches it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="177.71" dur="4.5">supposed to be a temporary structure to</text>
  <text start="179.99" dur="5.4">a temporary dwelling place which most</text>
  <text start="182.21" dur="4.77">points back toward when the children of</text>
  <text start="185.39" dur="4.08">Israel wandered through the wilderness</text>
  <text start="186.98" dur="4.92">in temporary shelters pointing even</text>
  <text start="189.47" dur="5.46">further back to how Abraham wandered</text>
  <text start="191.9" dur="5.37">through the land of what would become</text>
  <text start="194.93" dur="4.2">the Land of Israel but this was not his</text>
  <text start="197.27" dur="4.56">permanent dwelling place that he had a</text>
  <text start="199.13" dur="3.84">he was this was a temporary time and</text>
  <text start="201.83" dur="2.52">there would be a permanent dwelling</text>
  <text start="202.97" dur="3.33">place that he would have in the New</text>
  <text start="204.35" dur="4.23">Jerusalem and just like we will we will</text>
  <text start="206.3" dur="5.159">all have when yah and the fullness of</text>
  <text start="208.58" dur="5.22">who he is actually sukas or Tabernacles</text>
  <text start="211.459" dur="4.021">with man in the new heavens and new</text>
  <text start="213.8" dur="5.22">earth which is what sukkot is all</text>
  <text start="215.48" dur="4.979">pointing toward but so it&amp;#39;s pointing</text>
  <text start="219.02" dur="2.7">back toward that it&amp;#39;s also pouring of</text>
  <text start="220.459" dur="3.601">course toward what I just mentioned in</text>
  <text start="221.72" dur="4.38">Revelation 21 and 22 about the new</text>
  <text start="224.06" dur="4.5">heavens and new earth and yeah and the</text>
  <text start="226.1" dur="6.69">fullness of who he is dwelling with with</text>
  <text start="228.56" dur="5.91">us Joshua Joshua the son of yah the King</text>
  <text start="232.79" dur="4.47">of Kings he delivers up his kingdom to</text>
  <text start="234.47" dur="5.64">the father and the fullness of who he is</text>

  <text start="242.39" dur="5.55">he heard nor can our mind even imagine</text>
  <text start="245.06" dur="4.26">what that time is going to be like but I</text>
  <text start="247.94" dur="3.36">just I was really hit by this because</text>
