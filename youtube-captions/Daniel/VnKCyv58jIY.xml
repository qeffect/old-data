  <text start="9.719" dur="7.381">fifth day of Hanukkah has begun as the</text>
  <text start="13.44" dur="4.98">Sun set tonight and Sun this fifth day</text>
  <text start="17.1" dur="4.14">of Hanukkah I just want to talk briefly</text>
  <text start="18.42" dur="6.449">about the true meaning of Hanukkah and</text>
  <text start="21.24" dur="5.94">why why Hanukkah is so important you</text>
  <text start="24.869" dur="4.56">know we all probably know the history</text>
  <text start="27.18" dur="4.05">behind it if you don&amp;#39;t you should read</text>
  <text start="29.429" dur="4.891">the first and second book of Maccabees</text>
  <text start="31.23" dur="4.5">which are historical books that detail</text>
  <text start="34.32" dur="4.829">quite accurately the events surrounding</text>
  <text start="35.73" dur="5.61">the very first Hanukkah but in a</text>
  <text start="39.149" dur="5.101">nutshell Hanukkah was the time in which</text>
  <text start="41.34" dur="5.58">the small band of rebels known as The</text>
  <text start="44.25" dur="4.23">Maccabees had driven back the mightiest</text>
  <text start="46.92" dur="4.799">Empire in the world the Greek Empire at</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="4.95">the time and they liberated Israel</text>
  <text start="51.719" dur="4.23">liberated Jerusalem and liberated the</text>
  <text start="53.43" dur="5.01">temple and it took them eight days to</text>
  <text start="55.949" dur="5.191">fully cleanse the temple to repair it to</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="4.08">restore it to remove all the idolatry</text>
  <text start="61.14" dur="3.51">that the Greek Emperor had put inside</text>
  <text start="62.52" dur="6">and to fully dedicate it and cleanse it</text>
  <text start="64.65" dur="6">and just as Hanukkah was a season of</text>
  <text start="68.52" dur="4.86">cleansing and purifying and restoring</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="5.46">the temple so to this should be a season</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="5.16">in which we examine our lives and we ask</text>
  <text start="76.11" dur="4.98">the Holy Spirit to remove any idols in</text>
  <text start="78.54" dur="4.829">our life any idols in our heart in our</text>
  <text start="81.09" dur="4.98">temple you know the scripture says that</text>
  <text start="83.369" dur="5.07">our body is a temple for the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="86.07" dur="4.35">and so we should during this time also</text>
  <text start="88.439" dur="4.171">see to cleanse out our own temples and</text>
  <text start="90.42" dur="3.78">make sure that there&amp;#39;s no sin no</text>
  <text start="92.61" dur="4.619">idolatry if we&amp;#39;ve been struggling with</text>
  <text start="94.2" dur="6.059">sinful habits or we&amp;#39;ve allowed iniquity</text>
  <text start="97.229" dur="5.1">to to take to take hold in our lives</text>
  <text start="100.259" dur="4.081">anyway we should seek to ask the Holy</text>
  <text start="102.329" dur="3.33">Spirit to remove those things from us</text>
  <text start="104.34" dur="5.97">during this season and to rededicate</text>
  <text start="105.659" dur="8.25">ourselves to Yahshua promising to stay</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="5.28">pure to stay holy to walk in his word to</text>
  <text start="113.909" dur="3.121">walk in his spirit to cleave to his</text>
  <text start="115.59" dur="4.41">Commandments and to listen to his voice</text>
  <text start="117.03" dur="4.47">to be pure because that&amp;#39;s what the true</text>
  <text start="120" dur="3.659">meaning of Chanukah is all about it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="4.049">not about the dreidels or the block</text>
  <text start="123.659" dur="5.341">block T&amp;#39;s or the</text>
  <text start="125.549" dur="4.951">the storytelling it&amp;#39;s about living a</text>
  <text start="129" dur="4.25">life of purity and holiness about</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="5.61">cleansing about repentance about</text>
  <text start="133.25" dur="4.39">restoration and and rededication it is</text>
  <text start="136.11" dur="2.909">after all known as the feast of</text>
  <text start="137.64" dur="4.83">dedication that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s called in</text>
  <text start="139.019" dur="6.03">the book of John 10:22 and so we need to</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="4.59">we need to ask yahushua to help us to</text>
  <text start="145.049" dur="4.351">live wholly to live pure to get our</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="4.62">lives clean before him on this Chanukah</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="5.43">because that is what Chanukah the feast</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="4.889">of dedication is all about rededicating</text>
  <text start="154.83" dur="3.48">our lives to him and just as that temple</text>
  <text start="156.569" dur="3.901">was cleansed on the very first Chanukah</text>
  <text start="158.31" dur="6.45">long ago we should ask him to cleanse</text>
  <text start="160.47" dur="5.609">our temples during this season and I was</text>

  <text start="171.9" dur="4.949">going over John 10:22 and the following</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="3.99">scriptures where Yahshua actually</text>
  <text start="176.849" dur="4.831">celebrates Hanukkah the feast of</text>
  <text start="178.92" dur="5.52">dedication I was sharing how you know</text>
  <text start="181.68" dur="6.63">what better time to rededicate our lives</text>
  <text start="184.44" dur="6.629">to Yahshua to examine our hearts to ask</text>
  <text start="188.31" dur="5.34">the spirit to remove all addictions to</text>
  <text start="191.069" dur="3.961">sin and all bad habits and all sinful</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="3.45">things what better time to get clean</text>
  <text start="195.03" dur="3.989">when the rest of the world is you know</text>
  <text start="197.1" dur="3.75">going to parties and getting drunk and</text>
  <text start="199.019" dur="3.151">getting wrapped up and giving gifts to</text>
  <text start="200.85" dur="3.389">each other and really getting very</text>
  <text start="202.17" dur="4.039">worldly this is one of the most worldly</text>
  <text start="204.239" dur="4.981">times of the year this Christmas season</text>
  <text start="206.209" dur="6.971">so what better way to stand out from the</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="5.79">world and to be set apart than to</text>

  <text start="220.26" dur="4.379">festive time it&amp;#39;s known as the second</text>
  <text start="222.329" dur="3.961">Sukkot because you know the Maccabees</text>
  <text start="224.639" dur="3.96">they were not able to celebrate Sukkot</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="4.919">because they were fighting the Greeks so</text>
  <text start="228.599" dur="3.961">they kept a second Sukkot during</text>
  <text start="231.209" dur="3.511">Hanukkah which is why it&amp;#39;s eight</text>
  <text start="232.56" dur="3.959">another reason why it&amp;#39;s eight days this</text>
  <text start="234.72" dur="4.98">is like a second Sukkot so it&amp;#39;s a time</text>
  <text start="236.519" dur="6.661">of joy and festivity and partying and</text>
