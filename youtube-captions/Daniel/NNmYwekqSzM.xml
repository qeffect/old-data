  <text start="122.379" dur="3.39">interpretations it wasn&amp;#39;t a dream it was</text>
  <text start="123.94" dur="3.72">actually he was literally told to go</text>
  <text start="125.769" dur="4.86">somewhere and he saw things and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="127.66" dur="4.77">like a waking vision he saw things that</text>
  <text start="130.629" dur="3.601">were in reality and then yah sort of</text>
  <text start="132.43" dur="3.69">said this is important and he shared</text>

  <text start="142.12" dur="5.93">comment on this video or correct me so</text>
  <text start="145" dur="6.51">he was walking along this grand avenue</text>
  <text start="148.05" dur="5.95">and he saw all these statues of angels</text>
  <text start="151.51" dur="4.619">like babies and women angels and all</text>
  <text start="154" dur="6.12">these angels and then he saw a statue of</text>
  <text start="156.129" dur="6.451">Mary the Virgin Mary and then basically</text>
  <text start="160.12" dur="5.64">he was told to leave like get out go and</text>
  <text start="162.58" dur="6.57">so he turned around and left and he</text>
  <text start="165.76" dur="5.46">started walking and and then at one</text>
  <text start="169.15" dur="4.46">point he looked up at the Sun was really</text>
  <text start="171.22" dur="4.37">bright and then he left</text>
  <text start="173.61" dur="4.41">and basically what y&amp;#39;all showed me is</text>
  <text start="175.59" dur="4.56">that he is seeing pictures of the</text>
  <text start="178.02" dur="3.63">abomination of desolation you know the</text>
  <text start="180.15" dur="5.34">statues of the angels and Mary</text>
  <text start="181.65" dur="6">represents the paganism and then you</text>
  <text start="185.49" dur="5.91">know yah telling him to just suddenly</text>
  <text start="187.65" dur="5.52">leave walk away go that was very similar</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="3.35">to the words of Yasha when he says when</text>
  <text start="193.17" dur="4.32">you see this abomination of desolation</text>
  <text start="194.75" dur="7.36">don&amp;#39;t even think about anything just get</text>
  <text start="197.49" dur="6.18">out go leave and then when he looks up</text>
  <text start="202.11" dur="3.39">at the Sun you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of a</text>
  <text start="203.67" dur="3.63">lot of paganism that seeped into</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="4.47">religion whether it&amp;#39;s modern-day</text>
  <text start="207.3" dur="4.939">Christianity or Judaism or anything it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.97" dur="4.59">a lot of it has to do with Sun worship</text>
  <text start="212.239" dur="5.561">there&amp;#39;s also moon worship to that&amp;#39;s with</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="5.97">the Muslims but but then there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="217.8" dur="4.62">layer as well because the Sun in</text>
  <text start="220.53" dur="3.75">scriptures the true meaning of the Sun</text>
  <text start="222.42" dur="4.05">that represents yah whereas the moon</text>
  <text start="224.28" dur="4.14">represents the bride because we reflect</text>
  <text start="226.47" dur="5.18">yah to the world just like the moon</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="6.66">reflects yacht reflects the sun to the</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="4.9">sun&amp;#39;s light at night and so another</text>
  <text start="235.08" dur="2.85">layer of him looking up into the Sun was</text>
  <text start="236.55" dur="4.32">sort of yaad trying to cleanse unless</text>
  <text start="237.93" dur="5.46">he&amp;#39;s looking up into Yahshua and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="4.8">the only way we&amp;#39;re going to survive and</text>
  <text start="243.39" dur="5.04">not be deceived is by keeping our focus</text>
  <text start="245.67" dur="4.56">completely on Yahshua you know if you</text>
  <text start="248.43" dur="3.45">look at the timeline that I have on my</text>
  <text start="250.23" dur="3.27">website you&amp;#39;ll see that the abomination</text>
  <text start="251.88" dur="4.47">of desolation happens a full month</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="5.549">before the woman is safely in the safe</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="4.65">place and so this is why in Revelation</text>
  <text start="259.049" dur="3.901">12 you see the woman fleeing and the</text>
  <text start="261" dur="3.99">dragon casts water out of his mouth like</text>
  <text start="262.95" dur="4.44">his armies because waters represent</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="4.679">people to read The Book of Jeremiah when</text>
  <text start="267.39" dur="3.9">it talks about like judgment on Egypt it</text>
  <text start="269.669" dur="5.161">talks about these waters overflowing</text>
  <text start="271.29" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s symbolizing invading armies so be</text>
  <text start="274.83" dur="3.96">sending his armies and agents after us</text>
  <text start="276.54" dur="3.689">and so there will be some physical type</text>
  <text start="278.79" dur="3.12">of fleeing because we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="280.229" dur="4.381">get to the safe place for a full month</text>
  <text start="281.91" dur="4.41">afterward and the reason why is because</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="3.96">of the different times that are given in</text>
  <text start="286.32" dur="3.63">Daniel the 1260 days versus the 1290</text>
  <text start="288.57" dur="5.22">days there&amp;#39;s a difference of a month</text>
  <text start="289.95" dur="5.19">there but but i do want to continue to</text>
  <text start="293.79" dur="2.72">make the point from the podcast from</text>
  <text start="295.14" dur="3.38">last night that</text>
  <text start="296.51" dur="3.45">even though will be fleeing and yah will</text>
  <text start="298.52" dur="3.48">be supernatural protecting us and</text>
  <text start="299.96" dur="3.12">guiding us and stuff there will come a</text>
  <text start="302" dur="2.88">point eventually where he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="303.08" dur="4.98">send his chariots of fire his eagles and</text>
  <text start="304.88" dur="5.91">bring us exactly to that safe place and</text>
  <text start="308.06" dur="6.84">it&amp;#39;s only going to be by his spirit so I</text>
  <text start="310.79" dur="6">just wanted to emphasize that again and</text>
  <text start="314.9" dur="5.84">again I just want to continue to show</text>
  <text start="316.79" dur="8.43">some of these beautiful beautiful trees</text>
  <text start="320.74" dur="6.04">you can see just gorgeous though I love</text>
  <text start="325.22" dur="6.41">the colors and fall I mean yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.78" dur="4.85">handiwork is just so so amazing</text>
  <text start="332.89" dur="6.97">hallelujah all right Shalom and yah</text>
  <text start="337.88" dur="4.02">bless I&amp;#39;m I realize now I&amp;#39;m standing in</text>
  <text start="339.86" dur="3.27">a mega church parking lot so maybe I&amp;#39;ll</text>
