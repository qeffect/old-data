  <text start="88.619" dur="5.61">this season marks a great period of</text>
  <text start="90.78" dur="7.32">destruction but if you go to Zechariah</text>
  <text start="94.229" dur="6.57">chapter eight it details the different</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="4.32">fast days that the Jews were celebrating</text>
  <text start="100.799" dur="5.341">and of course one of them fell in the</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="6.75">fifth month to mark this time but if you</text>
  <text start="106.14" dur="4.71">go to Zechariah chapter 8 starting in</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="5.73">verse</text>
  <text start="110.85" dur="6.659">18 says in the word of Yahweh Savio came</text>
  <text start="114.9" dur="5.55">unto me saying thus saith Yahweh savio</text>
  <text start="117.509" dur="5.071">tree Yahweh of hosts the faster the</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="5.19">fourth month and the faster the fifth</text>
  <text start="122.58" dur="5.7">and the faster the seventh and the fast</text>
  <text start="125.64" dur="5.16">of the tenth shall be to the house of</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="5.7">Judah joy and gladness in cheerful</text>
  <text start="130.8" dur="5.67">feasts therefore love the truth and</text>
  <text start="133.98" dur="5.61">peace there will come a time when</text>
  <text start="136.47" dur="6.45">Yahshua the king of Israel is ruling and</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="5.52">reigning from Jerusalem and these fast</text>
  <text start="142.92" dur="3.69">the Jews have been keeping for thousands</text>
  <text start="145.11" dur="4.44">of years that have been times of morning</text>
  <text start="146.61" dur="6.69">will be transformed into a times of joy</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="6.12">and a cheerful feasts so even this most</text>
  <text start="153.3" dur="4.05">destructive time that the Jews remember</text>
  <text start="155.67" dur="4.59">the odd is going to wipe that away and</text>
  <text start="157.35" dur="5.91">replace it with joy and that reminds me</text>
  <text start="160.26" dur="5.729">a lot about revelation 21 and 22 where</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="5.55">it says he will wipe away all the tears</text>
  <text start="165.989" dur="5.791">from our eyes all the tears from her</text>
  <text start="168.81" dur="7.11">face I think it&amp;#39;s important to remember</text>
  <text start="171.78" dur="6.78">that Yahshua he&amp;#39;s in the business of</text>
  <text start="175.92" dur="5.76">redemption of redeeming that&amp;#39;s what he</text>
  <text start="178.56" dur="6">does and he redeems not only our lives</text>
  <text start="181.68" dur="5.1">by his blood through his spirit but it</text>
  <text start="184.56" dur="5.22">redeems even these destructive times</text>
  <text start="186.78" dur="5.79">such as the temple or when we&amp;#39;ve had our</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="5.1">lives of sin he blots that with his</text>
  <text start="192.57" dur="4.22">blood and replaces it with the</text>
  <text start="194.88" dur="5.22">resurrection power of him and the</text>
  <text start="196.79" dur="5.169">remembrance the memory of him delivering</text>
  <text start="200.1" dur="5.07">us from our sins so that we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="201.959" dur="5">to dwell on her pass anymore and in the</text>
  <text start="205.17" dur="4.05">same way he does this even historically</text>
  <text start="206.959" dur="4.691">as we see that the temple was destroyed</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="5.73">during this time</text>
  <text start="211.65" dur="6.11">and Joshua is going to turn this season</text>
