  <text start="49.23" dur="13.5">you into his image allow him to fill you</text>
  <text start="53.28" dur="12.57">and pardon it is only by his love that</text>

  <text start="79.95" dur="7.98">mock us but but jesus said even if</text>
  <text start="86.22" dur="6.53">people speak evil against you falsely</text>
  <text start="87.93" dur="4.82">for my name&amp;#39;s sake</text>
  <text start="98.11" dur="6.03">great is your reward in heaven for so</text>
  <text start="101.68" dur="4.64">they did to the prophets before you so</text>
  <text start="104.14" dur="4.62">even when you do that which is evil</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="6.45">excuse me when people do that which is</text>
  <text start="108.76" dur="8.64">evil against you God turns that around</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="6.67">where it says in Romans 8:28 it says</text>
  <text start="117.4" dur="8.4">that all things work out for the good of</text>
  <text start="119.44" dur="10.23">those who love according to my purposes</text>
  <text start="125.8" dur="5.88">who keep my Commandments so even the</text>
  <text start="129.67" dur="8.4">evil things that Satan might do against</text>
  <text start="131.68" dur="8.52">you God even hardship of persecution</text>
  <text start="138.07" dur="5.33">that might come against you actually can</text>
  <text start="140.2" dur="3.2">drive you closer to God</text>
  <text start="151.92" dur="5.69">it&amp;#39;s the Torah and the tour is the first</text>
  <text start="154.74" dur="2.87">five books in her</text>
  <text start="160.11" dur="6.11">well I mean if you want to pigeonhole me</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="3.08">I tend to just</text>
  <text start="178" dur="25.83">all those Commandments are good I think</text>
  <text start="180.16" dur="25.88">the problem is we actually the reason</text>
  <text start="203.83" dur="2.21">the</text>
  <text start="241.31" dur="3.539">even Peter said</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="13.73">oh you&amp;#39;re Jewish yeah so I do</text>
  <text start="360.4" dur="4.379">so so it&amp;#39;s on both sides</text>
  <text start="372.96" dur="4.23">I know you&amp;#39;re not a religious Jew but I</text>
  <text start="375.69" dur="4.25">challenge you go to my website it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.19" dur="2.75">called spirit</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="5.61">a little bit</text>
  <text start="432.129" dur="9.57">at your presence the fire causes the</text>
  <text start="438.759" dur="5.011">waters to boil to make your name known</text>
  <text start="441.699" dur="8.21">to your adversaries that the nation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.77" dur="6.139">may tremble at your presence he will</text>
  <text start="451.349" dur="31.99">bounce of years ago God in the form of</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="28.429">the Messiah of Israel not only destroys</text>
  <text start="483.339" dur="5.25">yourself that hurts all those around you</text>
  <text start="485.729" dur="5.201">and so God and His infinite justice and</text>
  <text start="488.589" dur="5.7">mercy he&amp;#39;s got to stop your sin one way</text>
  <text start="490.93" dur="9.359">or the other either or he banishes you</text>
  <text start="494.289" dur="7.38">to a place called the lake of fire we</text>
  <text start="500.289" dur="3.06">designed for the devil and his angels</text>
  <text start="501.669" dur="4.4">but if you&amp;#39;re determined to live like a</text>
  <text start="503.349" dur="7.16">devil that&amp;#39;s where you&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="506.069" dur="4.44">the Messiah talks about the lake of fire</text>
  <text start="513.05" dur="6.219">a place designed to torment the devil in</text>
  <text start="516.75" dur="7.349">his angels for all eternity because of</text>
  <text start="519.269" dur="7.371">their but also where humans will go if</text>
  <text start="524.099" dur="7.381">you want to live like these Devils do</text>
  <text start="526.64" dur="7.15">and unfortunately decide to live that</text>
  <text start="531.48" dur="5.099">way because the Messiah said then the</text>
  <text start="533.79" dur="6.859">road to destruction is broad-minded and</text>
  <text start="536.579" dur="8.061">the road we turn a life is narrow and</text>
  <text start="540.649" dur="3.991">few there be that find it</text>
  <text start="545.54" dur="5.02">and so I lift up my voice because he</text>
  <text start="549.209" dur="4.111">said by the foolishness of preaching</text>
  <text start="550.56" dur="5.13">I&amp;#39;ve ordained to save men and he says he</text>
  <text start="553.32" dur="4.079">confounds the wives but reveals these</text>
  <text start="555.69" dur="4.56">things for the humble so I lift up my</text>
  <text start="557.399" dur="7.25">voice for those few who will hear his</text>
  <text start="560.25" dur="7.62">call and respond to his spirit and</text>
  <text start="564.649" dur="10.331">surrender their lives to him and grab</text>
  <text start="567.87" dur="10.8">ahold of the Messiah&amp;#39;s seat seat there</text>
  <text start="574.98" dur="6.96">is a woman who was very sick for 12</text>
  <text start="578.67" dur="6.21">years she had an issue of blood and it</text>
  <text start="581.94" dur="6.269">says from the gospel that she grabbed a</text>
  <text start="584.88" dur="7.59">hold of the Messiah&amp;#39;s Zizi and when she</text>
  <text start="588.209" dur="6.541">did so she was instantly healed because</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="6.359">she knew the Scriptures where the psalm</text>
  <text start="594.75" dur="5.73">says there&amp;#39;s healing in his wings you</text>
  <text start="598.829" dur="3.661">know the same power that was given to</text>
  <text start="600.48" dur="5.49">the Messiah it&amp;#39;s given the ghost who</text>
  <text start="602.49" dur="5.43">loved him it was many years ago when I</text>
  <text start="605.97" dur="4.14">was on the phone with a friend and his</text>
  <text start="607.92" dur="5.07">three-year-old daughter at a temperature</text>
  <text start="610.11" dur="5.969">of 106 degrees which is very dangerous</text>
  <text start="612.99" dur="6">for an adult especially dangerous for a</text>
  <text start="616.079" dur="5.01">little girl and I began to pray and</text>
  <text start="618.99" dur="6.99">within two minutes her temperature lived</text>
  <text start="621.089" dur="6.93">on 106 and 98 these are the signs and</text>
  <text start="625.98" dur="5.45">wonders that follow those who truly</text>
  <text start="628.019" dur="6.231">submit Messiah of Israel</text>
  <text start="631.43" dur="5.79">but it also says that Jesus was unable</text>
  <text start="634.25" dur="5.55">to do science and wonders of Nazareth</text>
  <text start="637.22" dur="5.369">because they did not believe in him and</text>
  <text start="639.8" dur="5.94">their lack of faith literally prevented</text>
  <text start="642.589" dur="6.271">even the Messiah from doing science and</text>
  <text start="645.74" dur="5.28">wonders in the midst of them because</text>
  <text start="648.86" dur="5.19">their unbelief can limit this Holy One</text>
  <text start="651.02" dur="5.28">because that&amp;#39;s how he set things up it</text>
  <text start="654.05" dur="4.289">says in the song that the chosen of</text>
  <text start="656.3" dur="4.2">Israel because they did not believe in</text>
  <text start="658.339" dur="4.381">him they limited the Holy One of Israel</text>
  <text start="660.5" dur="6.089">and that entire first generation</text>
  <text start="662.72" dur="8.73">perished in the desert perished in the</text>
  <text start="666.589" dur="7.381">wilderness but the second generation who</text>
  <text start="671.45" dur="4.5">mixed faith with the Word of God with</text>
  <text start="673.97" dur="5.49">the Torah today we need to the promised</text>
  <text start="675.95" dur="6.329">land and so it is today when you take</text>
  <text start="679.46" dur="6.6">this word and mix it with faith and put</text>
  <text start="682.279" dur="5.281">your very trust in his Messiah and he</text>
  <text start="686.06" dur="3.44">covers you with his blood</text>
  <text start="687.56" dur="4.86">cleansing me from your guilty conscience</text>
  <text start="689.5" dur="6.76">filling it with his spirit that he might</text>
  <text start="692.42" dur="5.76">empower you to obey His Word YouTube get</text>
  <text start="696.26" dur="5.55">into the Promised Land although it&amp;#39;s not</text>
