  <text start="148.49" dur="7.38">for this first sabbath of shemitah is</text>
  <text start="151.06" dur="6.88">all about how the feast days that yahweh</text>
  <text start="155.87" dur="4.86">commands us to keep throughout the year</text>
  <text start="157.94" dur="5.01">should be a reflection of our lives if</text>
  <text start="160.73" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re living according to his will if</text>
  <text start="162.95" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re not living according to as well if</text>
  <text start="164.93" dur="3.27">we&amp;#39;re walking in sin we have things in</text>
  <text start="166.85" dur="3.81">our life that we shouldn&amp;#39;t have then</text>
  <text start="168.2" dur="3.9">what we&amp;#39;ll see is that our life even if</text>
  <text start="170.66" dur="3.06">we&amp;#39;re attempting to keep the feasts and</text>
  <text start="172.1" dur="3.69">obedience if we still have sinned in our</text>
  <text start="173.72" dur="4.89">life will see that our life is</text>
  <text start="175.79" dur="4.44">incongruent with what should be</text>
  <text start="178.61" dur="6.32">happening during those seasons so let me</text>
  <text start="180.23" dur="7.53">give you an example um when you get into</text>
  <text start="184.93" dur="5.5">late fall early winter and you can start</text>
  <text start="187.76" dur="4.56">going through the the early-mid and in</text>
  <text start="190.43" dur="3.809">the late winter you come into what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.32" dur="4.949">known as the season of Hanukkah and then</text>
  <text start="194.239" dur="4.801">Purim a couple of months later Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="197.269" dur="4.081">depending on the year usually occurs</text>
  <text start="199.04" dur="4.89">anywhere from early December too late</text>
  <text start="201.35" dur="4.05">december early january and then Purim</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="3.45">depending on the year usually occurs</text>
  <text start="205.4" dur="3.57">anywhere from mid-february to sometimes</text>
  <text start="207.38" dur="3.63">as late as mid-march just depending on</text>
  <text start="208.97" dur="5.549">the year the moon cycle and things like</text>
  <text start="211.01" dur="6.39">that so basically the season from what</text>
  <text start="214.519" dur="5.791">we would call early December all the way</text>
  <text start="217.4" dur="5.01">until about middle of March would be a</text>
  <text start="220.31" dur="3.63">season of victory because if you know</text>
  <text start="222.41" dur="3.09">anything about Hanukkah and Purim both</text>
  <text start="223.94" dur="5.01">of those feasts are all about victory</text>
  <text start="225.5" dur="6.32">you know Hanukkah is about yeah helping</text>
  <text start="228.95" dur="5.94">us overcome against impossible odds and</text>
  <text start="231.82" dur="4.75">Purim is about you turning these</text>
  <text start="234.89" dur="4.379">situations that are designed for our</text>
  <text start="236.57" dur="5.43">evil into victory and good so both of</text>
  <text start="239.269" dur="5.78">those fees are all about victory so from</text>
  <text start="242" dur="5.07">early december until the middle of March</text>
  <text start="245.049" dur="4.481">basically throughout the late fall and</text>
  <text start="247.07" dur="3.46">through all of winter this should be a</text>
  <text start="249.53" dur="5.17">season of</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="6.12">victory of overcoming of success in our</text>
  <text start="254.7" dur="6.06">lives if we&amp;#39;re walking according to his</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="6.239">will because our lives should reflect or</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="4.77">correspond with the feast the Yahoo set</text>
  <text start="262.889" dur="3.721">and of course we&amp;#39;re all living different</text>
  <text start="265.53" dur="2.79">lives we&amp;#39;re all living in different</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="3.96">places and we have different friends and</text>
  <text start="268.32" dur="3.36">families and and and you know places of</text>
  <text start="270.57" dur="2.79">worship that we go to so we all have</text>
  <text start="271.68" dur="4.56">different experiences but they should</text>
  <text start="273.36" dur="5.33">all reflect the victory that is</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="5.01">celebrated during Hanukkah and perm so</text>
  <text start="278.69" dur="6.01">I&amp;#39;ll give it just a personal testimony</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="5.58">so this last late fall going into early</text>
  <text start="284.7" dur="6.63">winter and then into mid to late winter</text>
  <text start="286.83" dur="8.85">I had a huge season of success and</text>
  <text start="291.33" dur="7.95">victory I was dragged into court by my</text>
  <text start="295.68" dur="7.14">ex-girlfriend Rachel and got a huge</text>
  <text start="299.28" dur="5.49">victory that last day in court I had</text>
  <text start="302.82" dur="5.099">never had a victory in clackamas court</text>
  <text start="304.77" dur="6.45">before because I always was getting</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="5.22">defeated by my ex-wife Annika and just</text>
  <text start="311.22" dur="3.09">was always it was just a very horrible</text>
  <text start="313.139" dur="2.251">time to the point where I didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="314.31" dur="2.46">want to walk into that courthouse</text>
  <text start="315.39" dur="3.99">because I had so many negative</text>
  <text start="316.77" dur="5.58">experiences and yet on December 31st</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="5.25">2015 I overcame and I was able to win a</text>
  <text start="322.35" dur="5.7">court case that that this girl had put</text>
  <text start="324.63" dur="5.61">against me to put a lifelong stocking</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="4.739">order against me and the judge wound up</text>
  <text start="330.24" dur="3.72">dismissing the case and I 1 and I was</text>
  <text start="332.789" dur="3.151">able to walk through the halls of</text>
  <text start="333.96" dur="3.48">clackamas courthouse and victory and</text>
  <text start="335.94" dur="4.05">actually made a whole podcast about that</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="4.289">earlier this year earlier this pagan</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="3.36">here so that was my first kind of major</text>
  <text start="341.729" dur="4.951">victory success that happened during</text>
  <text start="343.35" dur="5.28">that season of Hanukkah in and Purim and</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="5.28">then as we went forward into</text>
  <text start="348.63" dur="4.95">january-february March so in early</text>
  <text start="351.96" dur="3.69">februari I started reading this book</text>
  <text start="353.58" dur="3.99">called playing got it and this was a</text>
  <text start="355.65" dur="4.769">book that I had written many many years</text>
  <text start="357.57" dur="4.68">ago in my early 20s but i wanted to</text>
  <text start="360.419" dur="3.361">write it again using sort of the seeds</text>
  <text start="362.25" dur="2.94">of the same idea and i actually wanted</text>
  <text start="363.78" dur="3.72">to writing a completely different book</text>
  <text start="365.19" dur="5.43">than the one I had written in my early</text>
  <text start="367.5" dur="6.539">20s it kept some of the same thumb attic</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="5.43">elements but it branched off into many</text>
  <text start="374.039" dur="4.471">different things and so I wrote this</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="4.56">book from I think I started right at the</text>
  <text start="378.51" dur="3.96">beginning of februari and I finished by</text>
  <text start="380.61" dur="3.37">it it was March seventh or eighth but it</text>
  <text start="382.47" dur="3.82">basically took about five weeks</text>
  <text start="383.98" dur="3.99">I&amp;#39;ve never written a book that fast you</text>
  <text start="386.29" dur="3.42">know this book was ninety thousand two</text>
  <text start="387.97" dur="4.11">hundred words which you know that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="389.71" dur="5.16">average length of a average book that</text>
  <text start="392.08" dur="5.04">you would buy at a bookstore but usually</text>
  <text start="394.87" dur="4.47">it takes me about 3-4 months to write a</text>
  <text start="397.12" dur="4.68">book of that length and that&amp;#39;s average</text>
  <text start="399.34" dur="4.17">for any type of author I think Dean</text>
  <text start="401.8" dur="4.41">Koontz says he takes about three or four</text>
  <text start="403.51" dur="4.02">months to write a book and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.21" dur="2.91">pretty much average sometimes it can</text>
  <text start="407.53" dur="2.76">take longer sometimes it can take up to</text>
  <text start="409.12" dur="3.18">six months to write a book just</text>
  <text start="410.29" dur="3.81">depending on on the nature of the book</text>
  <text start="412.3" dur="3.48">but anyway the average is 3 months and</text>
  <text start="414.1" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s how long it usually took me but I</text>
  <text start="415.78" dur="4.38">wrote this thing in five weeks and it</text>
  <text start="418.09" dur="4.32">was amazing because I go to work and I</text>
  <text start="420.16" dur="3.78">work all day I get off at five I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="3.81">usually get home to about 5 30 depending</text>
  <text start="423.94" dur="3.93">on traffic and I just immediately go to</text>
  <text start="426.22" dur="2.91">my computer and start writing and I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="427.87" dur="2.88">write every single night are almost</text>
  <text start="429.13" dur="4.29">every single night other than Shabbat</text>
  <text start="430.75" dur="3.6">and it was amazing because i&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="433.42" dur="2.16">writing and then all of a sudden I</text>
  <text start="434.35" dur="4.08">realized it&amp;#39;s eight nine o&amp;#39;clock at</text>
  <text start="435.58" dur="4.11">night I haven&amp;#39;t even had dinner yet so</text>
  <text start="438.43" dur="4.29">is one of those stories that just floats</text>
  <text start="439.69" dur="4.38">that was a real victorious it&amp;#39;s time for</text>
  <text start="442.72" dur="4.71">me where the creative juices were</text>
  <text start="444.07" dur="4.83">flowing and then in March as you know</text>
  <text start="447.43" dur="4.41">you know of course this year perm</text>
  <text start="448.9" dur="4.29">happened in in late februari mid to late</text>
  <text start="451.84" dur="2.85">februari but then of course we had an</text>
  <text start="453.19" dur="3.39">eight-hour bet so then a lot of people</text>
  <text start="454.69" dur="3.33">were celebrating the second perm so we</text>
  <text start="456.58" dur="3.57">had like two perms you know februari</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="4.92">March so during this season of Purim a</text>
  <text start="460.15" dur="5.22">victory um I start emailing these agents</text>
  <text start="462.94" dur="4.91">and I emailed at least so far I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="465.37" dur="6.06">emailed about 250 literary agents and</text>
  <text start="467.85" dur="5.08">three agents within the first few days</text>
  <text start="471.43" dur="4.32">of me emailing requested the full</text>
  <text start="472.93" dur="4.44">manuscripts now one of them the largest</text>
  <text start="475.75" dur="2.64">of them actually the largest one in New</text>
  <text start="477.37" dur="3.57">York one of the largest ones inner</text>
  <text start="478.39" dur="4.32">cities they rejected me but the point is</text>
  <text start="480.94" dur="3.27">i still have to they&amp;#39;re looking at it</text>
  <text start="482.71" dur="3.69">now you know we might have more agents</text>
  <text start="484.21" dur="3.75">that requested or as i continued email</text>
  <text start="486.4" dur="4.72">but it was a huge victory and success</text>
  <text start="487.96" dur="5.019">also during this season</text>
  <text start="491.12" dur="4.23">especially recently I would say within</text>
  <text start="492.979" dur="4.921">the last oh gosh six to eight weeks last</text>
  <text start="495.35" dur="5.28">two months really started having victory</text>
  <text start="497.9" dur="5.519">at work at my own work in which just</text>
  <text start="500.63" dur="4.47">things are starting to finally gel I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="503.419" dur="3.661">been at this new job for about 10 months</text>
  <text start="505.1" dur="5.22">but only recently have things really</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="5.22">started kind of all all four cylinders</text>
  <text start="510.32" dur="4.86">are sort of firing now so it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="512.3" dur="5.82">victory there so what I&amp;#39;ve seen is is</text>
  <text start="515.18" dur="6.239">that in many parts of my life I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="518.12" dur="5.48">victory and overcoming and success and</text>
  <text start="521.419" dur="4.891">hope and optimism and things that were</text>
  <text start="523.6" dur="5.38">negative or evil turning to good and an</text>
  <text start="526.31" dur="4.969">impossible odds be overcome and that is</text>
  <text start="528.98" dur="4.92">what Hanukkah and Purim are all about so</text>
  <text start="531.279" dur="4.931">my point is is that if you&amp;#39;re walking in</text>
  <text start="533.9" dur="5.31">a way that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s pleasing to yacht</text>
  <text start="536.21" dur="4.92">your personal experiences and your walk</text>
  <text start="539.21" dur="4.47">should reflect the feast that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.13" dur="5.28">celebrating so here we are we just</text>
  <text start="543.68" dur="4.53">celebrated the new year Asha meteor has</text>

  <text start="576.8" dur="5.25">you know as we celebrate Passover as</text>
  <text start="579.7" dur="3.639">Passover is ending that evening and</text>
  <text start="582.05" dur="3.42">turning into the first day of unleavened</text>
  <text start="583.339" dur="3.961">bread which is a high shabbat we keep</text>
  <text start="585.47" dur="4.29">that passover seder that passover meal</text>
  <text start="587.3" dur="4.83">that&amp;#39;s described in Exodus 12 which of</text>
  <text start="589.76" dur="5.37">course is fulfilled by Yahshua when he</text>
  <text start="592.13" dur="4.47">when he dies on the tree so we do that</text>
  <text start="595.13" dur="3.66">and then that kicks off the seven days</text>
  <text start="596.6" dur="3.96">of unleavened bread where the first day</text>
  <text start="598.79" dur="3.63">and then seventh day are high shabbat no</text>

  <text start="605.3" dur="2.77">days of</text>
  <text start="606.51" dur="4.23">eating unleavened bread and making sure</text>
  <text start="608.07" dur="4.8">all 11 is nowhere within your within</text>
  <text start="610.74" dur="4.8">your gates and that you have an</text>
  <text start="612.87" dur="5.09">unleavened life of course a life of free</text>
  <text start="615.54" dur="5.31">of sin just as Yahshua was unleavened</text>
  <text start="617.96" dur="3.88">and we walk as he walked and and then of</text>
  <text start="620.85" dur="3.3">course we have the feast of firstfruits</text>
  <text start="621.84" dur="5.04">right in the midst of that week it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="624.15" dur="6.48">day after the Shabbat so always falls on</text>
  <text start="626.88" dur="4.92">a Saturday night to a Sunday night which</text>
  <text start="630.63" dur="3.15">is the feasts of first reach which is</text>
  <text start="631.8" dur="4.14">Omer number one that begins the 50 day</text>
  <text start="633.78" dur="5.55">countdown to shadow which this year will</text>
  <text start="635.94" dur="5.96">happen in in June so the point is we are</text>
  <text start="639.33" dur="6.12">now transitioning from the season of</text>
  <text start="641.9" dur="6.94">victory and overcoming and success and</text>
  <text start="645.45" dur="4.77">just you know overcoming a paw Paw&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="648.84" dur="2.55">were transitioning from that season and</text>
  <text start="650.22" dur="3.9">now we&amp;#39;re going into the season of</text>
  <text start="651.39" dur="5.13">deliverance the season of salvation the</text>
  <text start="654.12" dur="5.46">season of Passover so what you should</text>
  <text start="656.52" dur="5.28">start recognizing in your life if and</text>
  <text start="659.58" dur="4.41">this is a big if if you&amp;#39;re walking</text>
  <text start="661.8" dur="4.08">according to his word in other words</text>
  <text start="663.99" dur="3.48">you&amp;#39;re walking the light is he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="665.88" dur="3.21">light you&amp;#39;re not living in sin you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="667.47" dur="3.69">not committing sin you&amp;#39;re living holy</text>
  <text start="669.09" dur="3.15">you&amp;#39;re living pure and by the way if</text>
  <text start="671.16" dur="2.64">you&amp;#39;re one of those Christians or</text>
  <text start="672.24" dur="3.51">messianic that think that we always sin</text>
  <text start="673.8" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;re deceived because the scripture</text>
  <text start="675.75" dur="3">clearly says that if we have the blood</text>
  <text start="677.4" dur="3.21">of Yahshua upon us and we have his</text>
  <text start="678.75" dur="4.2">spirit within us and we&amp;#39;re walking</text>
  <text start="680.61" dur="4.89">rightly with him we will not sin okay we</text>
  <text start="682.95" dur="4.83">will overcome habitually and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="685.5" dur="4.23">whole point of why he became our high</text>
  <text start="687.78" dur="3.93">priest in the flesh so that he could be</text>
  <text start="689.73" dur="4.2">tempted by all of our infirmities and</text>
  <text start="691.71" dur="4.38">all all the temptations we go through</text>
  <text start="693.93" dur="3.99">and yet he overcame and so he could help</text>
  <text start="696.09" dur="3.83">us since he was a human being and he</text>
  <text start="697.92" dur="4.71">went through that whole human experience</text>
  <text start="699.92" dur="4.78">he can help us overcome any sense so we</text>
  <text start="702.63" dur="4.38">we should never sinned we should never</text>
  <text start="704.7" dur="4.02">sin if we should happen to sin god</text>
  <text start="707.01" dur="3.18">forbid but if we should happen to send</text>
  <text start="708.72" dur="4.02">we must repent quickly and get right</text>
  <text start="710.19" dur="5.25">with yah we have him there but really if</text>
  <text start="712.74" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re maturely walking in him we should</text>
  <text start="715.44" dur="4.17">not send we should never sin again and</text>
  <text start="717.87" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s why David cried in the psalm 119</text>
  <text start="719.61" dur="5.31">i will not sin i will keep your</text>
  <text start="721.98" dur="3.96">commandments and that&amp;#39;s the declaration</text>
  <text start="724.92" dur="3">we need to make in our heart always</text>
  <text start="725.94" dur="3.56">having a repentant heart of walking</text>
  <text start="727.92" dur="4.13">humbly and</text>
  <text start="729.5" dur="4.38">and and saying yeah I will never sin</text>
  <text start="732.05" dur="3.9">again I&amp;#39;m gonna live holy and love you</text>
  <text start="733.88" dur="4.23">and walk with you in purity and that</text>
  <text start="735.95" dur="3.84">should be our hearts cry so if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="738.11" dur="6.51">truly walking as well then then we</text>
  <text start="739.79" dur="7.34">should see that in this next month we</text>
  <text start="744.62" dur="5.21">should see a time of deliverance</text>
  <text start="747.13" dur="6.28">Passover salvation should mark our lives</text>
  <text start="749.83" dur="5.08">you know and you may be again all of our</text>
  <text start="753.41" dur="2.94">lives are different so you may be in a</text>
  <text start="754.91" dur="3.45">circumstance where you really need some</text>
  <text start="756.35" dur="4.68">deliverance in a certain area you know</text>

  <text start="761.03" dur="4.35">family situation maybe it&amp;#39;s some sort of</text>
  <text start="763.82" dur="3.09">thing that you just really need</text>
  <text start="765.38" dur="3.03">deliverance from and you&amp;#39;ve been crying</text>
  <text start="766.91" dur="3.06">out for deliverance well you should get</text>
  <text start="768.41" dur="5.22">that deliverance because that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="769.97" dur="5.64">season we&amp;#39;re in so so when we get</text>
  <text start="773.63" dur="3.51">through this month of Aviv which you</text>

  <text start="777.14" dur="5.58">the night of April seventh so this goes</text>
  <text start="781.16" dur="4.44">through now for the next month right up</text>

  <text start="804.77" dur="6">the first month basically the new year&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="806.81" dur="7.04">day was the day in which Moses had the</text>
  <text start="810.77" dur="6.66">Levites erect the tabernacle of witness</text>
  <text start="813.85" dur="5.32">which was a big ordeal the tabernacle</text>
