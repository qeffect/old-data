  <text start="35.76" dur="3.959">during finals week without disturbing</text>
  <text start="37.649" dur="4.141">the students and I think we reached a</text>
  <text start="39.719" dur="5.281">good compromise today was the last</text>
  <text start="41.79" dur="6.03">official full day of classes before went</text>

  <text start="56.34" dur="4.44">about 1120 in the morning preached until</text>
  <text start="58.949" dur="4.651">about one thirty in the afternoon so</text>
  <text start="60.78" dur="5.43">good two hours although I was frozen by</text>
  <text start="63.6" dur="4.769">the time i was done my crowd never got</text>
  <text start="66.21" dur="4.74">over maybe 10 or 15 students the whole</text>
  <text start="68.369" dur="4.441">day maybe 20 students at one point when</text>
  <text start="70.95" dur="4.559">i was disputing with some some</text>
  <text start="72.81" dur="3.96">hypocrites but never really got over 10</text>
  <text start="75.509" dur="3.571">or 15 students because it was just so</text>
  <text start="76.77" dur="4.29">frigid but i preached i actually was</text>
  <text start="79.08" dur="5.82">able to preach the entire psalm 119</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="6.9">today all 170 + vs there was a man there</text>
  <text start="84.9" dur="6.27">an older man i think he was homeless his</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="5.28">name&amp;#39;s Marcus and I offered to take him</text>
  <text start="91.17" dur="4.589">out to lunch sometime later after</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="3.93">Shabbat and please pray for him he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.759" dur="4.32">coming under conviction of the spirit he</text>
  <text start="97.17" dur="5.04">knows the Bible but he&amp;#39;s a hypocrite he</text>
  <text start="100.079" dur="4.441">he won&amp;#39;t obey the entire Bible but he</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="4.5">knows it so pray for Marcus I believe</text>
  <text start="104.52" dur="3.87">he&amp;#39;s coming into a conviction even in</text>
  <text start="106.71" dur="2.699">the handful of 10 or 15 students that</text>
  <text start="108.39" dur="3.21">were there the whole day while I was</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="3.871">preaching which is a miracle because I</text>
  <text start="111.6" dur="3.839">mean it is freezing the windchill factor</text>
  <text start="113.28" dur="4.979">today is like it&amp;#39;s got to be below zero</text>
  <text start="115.439" dur="4.441">it is it is I see today very unusual for</text>
  <text start="118.259" dur="5.161">Portland especially when it&amp;#39;s still fall</text>
  <text start="119.88" dur="4.98">but anyway I saw one woman with a you</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="2.58">know head cover hush and have had to</text>
  <text start="124.86" dur="2.91">head covering she was covering her head</text>
  <text start="126" dur="3.929">because it was so cold but I could see</text>
  <text start="127.77" dur="4.24">the spirit of sobriety upon her face she</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="4.341">was coming into a conviction of sin</text>
  <text start="132.01" dur="4.27">there are some other hecklers even</text>
  <text start="134.27" dur="3.81">Andrew came out he was much more sober</text>
  <text start="136.28" dur="3.96">much more sober like his whole attitude</text>
  <text start="138.08" dur="3.81">had changed Andrew and then this other</text>
  <text start="140.24" dur="4.47">arrogant ap is that i&amp;#39;ve contended with</text>
  <text start="141.89" dur="4.65">for you know the last several days weeks</text>
  <text start="144.71" dur="7.2">at psu and he was totally different as</text>
  <text start="146.54" dur="6.75">well it was an amazing day the spirit of</text>
  <text start="151.91" dur="3.12">yacht even though the crowd was only ten</text>
  <text start="153.29" dur="3.6">or fifteen students the crip the Spirit</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="3.3">of God descended and I did have some</text>
  <text start="156.89" dur="3.09">good one-on-one dialogues and</text>
  <text start="158.33" dur="4.89">conversations with various students even</text>
  <text start="159.98" dur="5.1">in the midst of that small crowd just on</text>
  <text start="163.22" dur="4.77">various subjects mostly centering about</text>
  <text start="165.08" dur="4.11">living holy the main topic of the day</text>
  <text start="167.99" dur="3.27">for the two hours was the blood</text>
  <text start="169.19" dur="5.19">atonement of Yahshua and then of course</text>
  <text start="171.26" dur="4.74">this was my last official day at PSU in</text>
  <text start="174.38" dur="3.21">terms of this is the last official day</text>
  <text start="176" dur="3.54">of classes because next week is finals</text>
  <text start="177.59" dur="3.81">I&amp;#39;ll still be going to psu next week but</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="3.63">I think i&amp;#39;m going to be doing more</text>
  <text start="181.4" dur="3.69">one-on-one witnessing and passing out my</text>
  <text start="183.17" dur="3.03">cards and things like that because i</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="3.9">don&amp;#39;t want to disturb the students while</text>
  <text start="186.2" dur="4.41">they take their exams so this was like</text>
  <text start="188.99" dur="3.24">sort of my last official day and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="3.57">you know the 17th day and yash is</text>
  <text start="192.23" dur="5.16">returning in 2017 which is kind of cool</text>
  <text start="194.18" dur="5.1">but I blew my shofar eight times eight</text>
  <text start="197.39" dur="3.06">means the new beginning because there is</text>
  <text start="199.28" dur="4.59">a new beginning that&amp;#39;s about to happen</text>
  <text start="200.45" dur="4.41">when ya cast Satan from heaven down to</text>
  <text start="203.87" dur="2.73">the earth it&amp;#39;s going to be a new</text>
  <text start="204.86" dur="2.97">beginning all right not a new beginning</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="3.45">a lot of people are looking forward to</text>
  <text start="207.83" dur="3.9">but it&amp;#39;ll be a new beginning and so I</text>
  <text start="210.05" dur="3.57">did that and then even after i left i</text>
