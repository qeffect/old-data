  <text start="2.939" dur="4.531">with torah restoration ministries and</text>
  <text start="4.83" dur="7.439">this is my weekly shabbat shalom podcast</text>
  <text start="7.47" dur="7.379">today is episode 29 dispensationalism</text>
  <text start="12.269" dur="4.321">and replacement theology again the</text>
  <text start="14.849" dur="5.491">station can be found on my website at</text>
  <text start="16.59" dur="5.79">wwc spirit and tour com along the upper</text>
  <text start="20.34" dur="4.14">left hand corner you&amp;#39;ll see a link</text>
  <text start="22.38" dur="8.09">called teachings and you could find this</text>
  <text start="24.48" dur="9.48">teaching there so there are two very</text>
  <text start="30.47" dur="6.4">huge deceptions that dominates our</text>
  <text start="33.96" dur="5.009">modern age with regards to Christianity</text>
  <text start="36.87" dur="4.23">and they are dispensationalism and</text>
  <text start="38.969" dur="3.721">replacement theology in case you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="41.1" dur="3.209">know what these two terms mean I will</text>
  <text start="42.69" dur="4.139">briefly define them here at the</text>
  <text start="44.309" dur="4.68">beginning number one dispensationalism</text>
  <text start="46.829" dur="3.931">although there are many flavors of this</text>
  <text start="48.989" dur="3.181">doctrine they&amp;#39;re probably as many</text>
  <text start="50.76" dur="3.84">flavors as this doctrine as there are</text>
  <text start="52.17" dur="4.799">ice cream flavors the basic premise is</text>
  <text start="54.6" dur="4.349">that Yahweh operated through the ages in</text>
  <text start="56.969" dur="5.701">different ways so there was the age of</text>
  <text start="58.949" dur="6">conscience the age of the law the age of</text>
  <text start="62.67" dur="5.34">grace etc depending on the age one lives</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="5.131">in it affects our relation to Yahweh and</text>
  <text start="68.01" dur="3.929">how we are to obey His commandments so</text>
  <text start="70.08" dur="3.78">basically there are different standards</text>
  <text start="71.939" dur="4.141">of righteousness for instance a man</text>
  <text start="73.86" dur="4.35">living in the age of conscience would</text>
  <text start="76.08" dur="3.87">not be as beholden to the law as a man</text>
  <text start="78.21" dur="4.38">living in the age of the law likewise</text>
  <text start="79.95" dur="5.25">the man living in the age of grace does</text>
  <text start="82.59" dur="4.349">not need to do the same things to attain</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="3.33">righteousness as a man living in the age</text>
  <text start="86.939" dur="3.451">of law would so different stances</text>
  <text start="88.53" dur="3.199">standards of righteousness depending on</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="4.019">the time period that you&amp;#39;re living in</text>
  <text start="91.729" dur="5.68">number 2 replacement theology rooted in</text>
  <text start="94.409" dur="4.621">hatred for jews and anti-semitism this</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="3.511">doctor states that yahweh is totally</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="4.769">finished with the Jewish people Israel</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="5.76">and demands for Jews to become filthy</text>
  <text start="103.799" dur="7.021">pagan Gentile pigs in a filthy pagan</text>
  <text start="106.68" dur="7.799">Gentile I know that strong language but</text>
  <text start="110.82" dur="6.36">that&amp;#39;s the truth essentially Jews are</text>
  <text start="114.479" dur="6.121">done with the Covenant it is over and</text>
  <text start="117.18" dur="6.329">now they have to become basically like</text>
  <text start="120.6" dur="4.769">the Christians now both of these</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="3.451">doctrines feed the other they support</text>
  <text start="125.369" dur="3.78">the other and both are totally opposed</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="3.7">to the renewed covenant to the New</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="4.191">Testament</text>
  <text start="130.66" dur="5.02">do we not read in both Malachi and in</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="5.31">Hebrews that Yahweh even Yahshua does</text>
  <text start="135.68" dur="4.35">not change in fact in both books we read</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="6.15">the passage he is the same yesterday</text>
  <text start="140.03" dur="6.9">today and forever well that&amp;#39;s true how</text>
  <text start="144.8" dur="7.35">could ya we changed the way he operates</text>
  <text start="146.93" dur="7.53">with us if he does not change after all</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="5.46">we know from Scripture that yah is not a</text>
  <text start="154.46" dur="5.07">respecter of persons yet if a person</text>
  <text start="157.61" dur="4.17">from the age of law is compared to a</text>
  <text start="159.53" dur="4.35">person from the age of grace they are</text>
  <text start="161.78" dur="5.01">judged by two different standards of</text>
  <text start="163.88" dur="5.25">righteousness the former must keep the</text>
  <text start="166.79" dur="4.83">Torah and the latter does not well how</text>
  <text start="169.13" dur="5.58">absurd how totally unscriptural so</text>
  <text start="171.62" dur="4.5">depending on what year I live in I may</text>
  <text start="174.71" dur="3.54">go to the lake of fire for different</text>
  <text start="176.12" dur="5.85">reasons than someone else this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="178.25" dur="8.13">make any sense why would you all have</text>
  <text start="181.97" dur="5.97">two different standards Exodus 12</text>
  <text start="186.38" dur="3.57">declare is very clearly that there is</text>
  <text start="187.94" dur="4.8">one Torah for the Israelite and the</text>
  <text start="189.95" dur="4.44">Gentile again if we go to the New</text>
  <text start="192.74" dur="4.02">Covenant the New Testament and Ephesians</text>
  <text start="194.39" dur="5.099">2 we read that there is no Jew and</text>
  <text start="196.76" dur="6.9">Gentile but we are all one grafted into</text>
  <text start="199.489" dur="5.941">the Commonwealth of Israel the Torah or</text>
  <text start="203.66" dur="7.2">if we want to call it the Jewish Torah</text>
  <text start="205.43" dur="9.95">is for everyone Messiah himself was a</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="6.66">Jew Joshua came from the tribe of Judah</text>
  <text start="215.38" dur="3.73">replacement theology is laughable but</text>
  <text start="217.52" dur="5.189">helps to undergird the foolish doctrine</text>
  <text start="219.11" dur="7.41">of praetor ism praetor ism of course is</text>
  <text start="222.709" dur="5.491">the eschatology that believes that all</text>
  <text start="226.52" dur="4.439">prophecies in the Book of Daniel</text>
  <text start="228.2" dur="3.99">revelation have been fulfilled and we</text>
  <text start="230.959" dur="4.381">are already living in the new heavens</text>
  <text start="232.19" dur="5.7">and the new earth Romans 11 plainly</text>
  <text start="235.34" dur="4.619">declares that it is Gentiles who must</text>
  <text start="237.89" dur="5.61">humble themselves and be grafted into</text>
  <text start="239.959" dur="6.091">the Jewish olive tree the olive tree</text>
  <text start="243.5" dur="5.37">Romans 11 represents Israel and even</text>
  <text start="246.05" dur="6.18">more specifically Yahshua thus the olive</text>
  <text start="248.87" dur="7.77">tree on both counts is Jewish or</text>
  <text start="252.23" dur="6.09">includes the Jews Paul declares the the</text>
  <text start="256.64" dur="4.17">Oracles of yahwah were delivered to the</text>
  <text start="258.32" dur="4.32">jews and this is why Paul says in the</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="2.91">book of Romans that there is great</text>
  <text start="262.64" dur="5.64">advantage in</text>
  <text start="263.72" dur="6.99">every way to being a Jew now of course</text>
  <text start="268.28" dur="4.29">the Jews who despise Yahshua and follow</text>
  <text start="270.71" dur="3.69">Talmud rather than the Torah are as</text>
  <text start="272.57" dur="5.73">pagan as the Christian Gentile pigs I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="274.4" dur="6.81">not referring to those but the Jews who</text>
  <text start="278.3" dur="6.03">love Messiah and keep every jot and</text>
  <text start="281.21" dur="4.83">tittle of Torah is declared by Paul to</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="5.1">have an advantage over converted</text>
  <text start="286.04" dur="5.13">Gentiles it&amp;#39;s the pagan Christian</text>
  <text start="289.43" dur="3.87">Gentile pigs you need to shut up and</text>
  <text start="291.17" dur="6.87">humble themselves begging to be grafted</text>
  <text start="293.3" dur="6.66">into Israel and her Torah so now with</text>
  <text start="298.04" dur="3.54">the foolishness of dispensationalism and</text>
  <text start="299.96" dur="4.02">replacement theology these two ideas</text>
  <text start="301.58" dur="3.96">which sprang from that heretic Marcy on</text>
  <text start="303.98" dur="4.14">in the second century have birthed more</text>
  <text start="305.54" dur="6.57">strange children reception than I can</text>
  <text start="308.12" dur="6.12">even count both of these theologies are</text>
  <text start="312.11" dur="4.29">very very damaging and they are totally</text>
  <text start="314.24" dur="6">anti scriptural and it&amp;#39;s important to</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="6.12">realize that although dispensationalism</text>
  <text start="320.24" dur="4.53">and replacement theology dominate much</text>
  <text start="322.52" dur="4.38">of modern Christianity both of these</text>
  <text start="324.77" dur="5.82">doctrines are completely antithetical</text>
  <text start="326.9" dur="5.45">and opposed to the new testament to the</text>
  <text start="330.59" dur="5.4">Brit hadashah the renewed covenant</text>
  <text start="332.35" dur="6.819">because on the one hand we have</text>
  <text start="335.99" dur="4.8">dispensationalism which completely flies</text>
  <text start="339.169" dur="3.511">in the face of the scripture in Hebrews</text>
  <text start="340.79" dur="4.35">that says yaad does not change he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="342.68" dur="4.049">same yesterday and today and forever on</text>
  <text start="345.14" dur="3.63">the other hand you have replacement</text>
  <text start="346.729" dur="4.081">theology which completely flies in the</text>
  <text start="348.77" dur="4.56">face of Romans chapter 11 in Ephesians</text>
  <text start="350.81" dur="4.53">chapter 2 especially Ephesians 2 which</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="4.26">has very clearly look there there is no</text>
  <text start="355.34" dur="4.889">Jew and Gentile we&amp;#39;re all one in Messiah</text>
  <text start="357.59" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re all grafted into Israel we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="360.229" dur="3.361">part of a Commonwealth of Israel through</text>
  <text start="362.21" dur="4.35">the blood of Messiah which was in the</text>
  <text start="363.59" dur="5.07">exact case in the tanakh specifically</text>
  <text start="366.56" dur="5.52">Exodus chapter 12 where it says there is</text>
  <text start="368.66" dur="6.18">one law for the Jew and the stranger for</text>
  <text start="372.08" dur="5.399">the Hebrew and the in the foreigner one</text>
  <text start="374.84" dur="6">law we as humans want to complicate</text>
  <text start="377.479" dur="6.591">things and trying to to create these</text>
  <text start="380.84" dur="5.27">doctrines and theologies that that that</text>
  <text start="384.07" dur="4.84">complicate the very very simple truth</text>
  <text start="386.11" dur="4.809">the fact is yah has always dealt the</text>
  <text start="388.91" dur="4.47">same with mankind from from the first</text>
  <text start="390.919" dur="4.21">day of Adam till now he is expected us</text>
  <text start="393.38" dur="3.969">to obey his instruction</text>
  <text start="395.129" dur="4.61">granted in the time of Adam those</text>
  <text start="397.349" dur="5.761">instructions were much more simple</text>
  <text start="399.739" dur="5.29">because we were much more pure and over</text>
  <text start="403.11" dur="4.5">time he&amp;#39;s had to add instructions but</text>
  <text start="405.029" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s always been obeying his</text>
  <text start="407.61" dur="5.009">instructions and if we obey his</text>
  <text start="410.339" dur="4.05">instructions out of a heart of love then</text>
  <text start="412.619" dur="4.47">we will be able to walk with him in</text>
  <text start="414.389" dur="6.63">right relationship this has always been</text>
  <text start="417.089" dur="6.57">the case and yes he selected avrohom and</text>
  <text start="421.019" dur="5.52">he created a people the Hebrews that he</text>
  <text start="423.659" dur="5.07">chose but he he says halter to the</text>
  <text start="426.539" dur="5.071">Tanakh that he wanted the Hebrews the</text>
  <text start="428.729" dur="5.79">Israel to be a a light to the Gentiles a</text>
  <text start="431.61" dur="4.829">light to the nation&amp;#39;s because he wanted</text>
  <text start="434.519" dur="4.05">to bring in the other nations into</text>
  <text start="436.439" dur="3.54">Israel and we see this happening we see</text>
  <text start="438.569" dur="3.78">this with the Egyptians who went with</text>
  <text start="439.979" dur="6.03">the mixed multitude in Exodus 12 we see</text>
  <text start="442.349" dur="6.18">this with with Rahab the harlot who is</text>
  <text start="446.009" dur="5.34">grafted into Israel after helping to</text>
  <text start="448.529" dur="5.37">hide the spice we see this with Ruth the</text>
  <text start="451.349" dur="4.92">Moabite us who marries boas and is</text>
  <text start="453.899" dur="4.44">grafted into Israel and becomes an</text>
  <text start="456.269" dur="4.29">Israelite we see this all through the</text>
  <text start="458.339" dur="3.99">Tanakh where Gentiles and those who are</text>
  <text start="460.559" dur="3.87">born with Gentile blood become</text>
  <text start="462.329" dur="7.38">Israelites and it&amp;#39;s the same thing in</text>
  <text start="464.429" dur="7.5">fees chapter 2 so the idea that that</text>
  <text start="469.709" dur="3.99">there is any sort of replacement</text>
  <text start="471.929" dur="4.26">theology where yah has just totally</text>
  <text start="473.699" dur="3.78">finished with Israel and the Jews and</text>
  <text start="476.189" dur="3.87">now he&amp;#39;s replaced it with the Gentile</text>
  <text start="477.479" dur="4.35">Church at the Gentile Church or somehow</text>
  <text start="480.059" dur="4.23">the new Israel that&amp;#39;s completely opposed</text>
  <text start="481.829" dur="4.62">to Scripture and the idea that yah</text>
  <text start="484.289" dur="5.071">somehow deals differently with people</text>
  <text start="486.449" dur="4.08">depending on what time period a person</text>
  <text start="489.36" dur="5.399">is living in is also completely</text>
  <text start="490.529" dur="7.29">antithetical to scripture God is the</text>
  <text start="494.759" dur="5.19">same he does not change he deals with us</text>
  <text start="497.819" dur="4.02">in the same manner and in the same way</text>
  <text start="499.949" dur="6.63">all through history from the time of</text>
  <text start="501.839" dur="6.78">Adam until now and furthermore there are</text>
  <text start="506.579" dur="4.74">scriptures particularly in Isaiah where</text>
  <text start="508.619" dur="7.08">yo says as long as the Sun and the moon</text>
  <text start="511.319" dur="7.47">are in heaven so will my promise endure</text>
  <text start="515.699" dur="4.921">my covenant will endure with Israel well</text>
  <text start="518.789" dur="4.11">replacement theology completely opposes</text>
  <text start="520.62" dur="4.469">that in fact there&amp;#39;s so much scripture</text>
  <text start="522.899" dur="4.29">that opposes the doctrine of replacement</text>
  <text start="525.089" dur="3.421">theology and dispensationalism it is a</text>
  <text start="527.189" dur="5.071">wonder that any</text>
  <text start="528.51" dur="6.39">in any serious Bible believer who has</text>
  <text start="532.26" dur="6.41">even read a little portion of their</text>
  <text start="534.9" dur="6.57">Bible could believe those two doctrines</text>
  <text start="538.67" dur="4.33">because they just that they fall apart</text>
  <text start="541.47" dur="3.24">whenever you examine scriptures</text>
  <text start="543" dur="4.74">thoroughly whenever you even if you</text>
  <text start="544.71" dur="5.4">don&amp;#39;t examine them and thirdly so I pray</text>
  <text start="547.74" dur="5.43">that this short podcast was enlightening</text>
  <text start="550.11" dur="5.4">and cleared up the deceptions that are</text>
