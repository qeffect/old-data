  <text start="36.87" dur="4.64">the gorge just to the east of Portland</text>

  <text start="41.51" dur="6.61">firecrackers on Shabbat of all days and</text>
  <text start="44.82" dur="5.7">it ignited into a fire and the fire has</text>
  <text start="48.12" dur="4.77">grown so big that a threatening molten</text>

  <text start="64.14" dur="5.37">literally jumped over the river the</text>
  <text start="66.33" dur="6.48">burning embers were flung by the wind</text>
  <text start="69.51" dur="6.179">and the fire started in Washington and</text>
  <text start="72.81" dur="5.82">so there&amp;#39;s been evacuations now in the</text>
  <text start="75.689" dur="6.121">East from both the Oregon side and</text>
  <text start="78.63" dur="6.33">Washington side and just huge I mean you</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="6.39">go outside literally you see ash just</text>
  <text start="84.96" dur="6.57">swirling in the air and the Sun looks</text>
  <text start="88.2" dur="6.39">like this burnt orange the moon is blood</text>
  <text start="91.53" dur="5.61">blood-red and this has been happening</text>
  <text start="94.59" dur="4.83">now for for a few days so literally</text>
  <text start="97.14" dur="4.939">Oregon and Washington the Northwest is</text>
  <text start="99.42" dur="5.909">in sackcloth and ashes and ashes</text>
  <text start="102.079" dur="5.351">during the sixth Hebrew month commonly</text>
  <text start="105.329" dur="3.801">called the month of Elul or the Jews</text>
  <text start="107.43" dur="5.119">have a tradition that it&amp;#39;s a month of</text>
  <text start="109.13" dur="5.769">repentance leading up to the fall feasts</text>
  <text start="112.549" dur="4.151">trumpets which occurs this year on the</text>
  <text start="114.899" dur="4.561">21st and then ten days later yom kippur</text>
  <text start="116.7" dur="5.07">the day of atonement so it&amp;#39;s fascinating</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="5.04">how this sackcloth and ashes has</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="5.879">literally clothed the northwest and then</text>
  <text start="124.5" dur="4.83">of course out in the southeast of the</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="5.001">United States we&amp;#39;re getting slammed by</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="5.12">these mega hurricanes first Harvey</text>
  <text start="132.65" dur="4.169">one of the biggest hurricanes that ever</text>
  <text start="134.45" dur="5.46">hit Texas for I don&amp;#39;t know how long</text>
  <text start="136.819" dur="4.831">since I think the 60s and now this</text>
  <text start="139.91" dur="3.21">hurricane Irma is coming up I mean you</text>
  <text start="141.65" dur="4.86">see this monster they said it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="7.89">biggest hurricane ever recorded outside</text>
  <text start="146.51" dur="6.119">of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico and</text>
  <text start="151.01" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s looks like it&amp;#39;s headed toward</text>
  <text start="152.629" dur="5.341">Florida so you know you got these huge</text>
  <text start="155.84" dur="5.49">fires I mean unprecedented fires really</text>
  <text start="157.97" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;ve lived here for well since 1998 with</text>
  <text start="161.33" dur="2.939">the exception of three years in</text>
  <text start="162.41" dur="3.54">California but I pretty much lived here</text>
  <text start="164.269" dur="5.601">for almost 20 years I&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="165.95" dur="7.289">anything like this in Portland ever and</text>
  <text start="169.87" dur="6.04">they said that the the air quality index</text>
  <text start="173.239" dur="6.181">is as bad as its it&amp;#39;s ever been recorded</text>
  <text start="175.91" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s up to 271 meteorologists who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="179.42" dur="4.709">worked for 30 40 50 years in the area</text>
  <text start="181.31" dur="3.78">I&amp;#39;ve never seen it like this and of</text>
  <text start="184.129" dur="2.67">course now we&amp;#39;re having these huge</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="3.899">hurricanes that we&amp;#39;ve never seen I mean</text>
  <text start="186.799" dur="4.591">this Hermann al is that I think clocked</text>
  <text start="188.989" dur="4.291">at upwards of 185 miles per hour which</text>
  <text start="191.39" dur="4.219">is basically the strongest hurricane</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="6.179">they&amp;#39;ve ever seen through the Atlantic</text>
  <text start="195.609" dur="6.581">so you know yeah is allowing these huge</text>
  <text start="199.459" dur="5.881">fires to consume and burn the Northwest</text>
  <text start="202.19" dur="4.79">and you got these massive storms one on</text>
  <text start="205.34" dur="5.07">top of the other hitting the southeast</text>
  <text start="206.98" dur="6.64">you know it does appear that he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="210.41" dur="5.46">to say something right I mean he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="213.62" dur="4.05">basically I think showing that he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="215.87" dur="4.14">happy with the fruits of this nation I</text>
  <text start="217.67" dur="5.849">mean by and large the Christian Church</text>
  <text start="220.01" dur="7.699">is lukewarm it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no sign of</text>
  <text start="223.519" dur="6.481">revival or repentance evangelism is dead</text>
  <text start="227.709" dur="4.09">people are not keeping his Commandments</text>
  <text start="230" dur="5.13">the Shabbat the Sabbath day people most</text>
  <text start="231.799" dur="4.59">people ignore not to even mention just</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="2.55">the basic commandments of you know</text>
  <text start="236.389" dur="4.021">taking care of the poor and the widow</text>
  <text start="237.68" dur="3.869">and the orphan loving your neighbors</text>
  <text start="240.41" dur="3.659">yourself I mean these things are just</text>
  <text start="241.549" dur="4.261">largely ignored in this nation by and</text>
  <text start="244.069" dur="3.271">large not by everyone but by most people</text>
  <text start="245.81" dur="3.72">and it&amp;#39;s and theirs doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="3.509">any sign of repentance in fact if</text>
  <text start="249.53" dur="4.2">anything people are just sort of</text>
  <text start="250.849" dur="5.64">fascinated by the quote-unquote science</text>
  <text start="253.73" dur="5.7">of the total solar eclipse that happened</text>
  <text start="256.489" dur="4.711">a couple weeks ago and fascinated by</text>
  <text start="259.43" dur="3.5">these hurricanes if they&amp;#39;re not actually</text>
  <text start="261.2" dur="4.74">being affected by it</text>
  <text start="262.93" dur="5.95">fascinated by how the northwest is cloak</text>
  <text start="265.94" dur="6.48">the dust and ash but there&amp;#39;s no real</text>
  <text start="268.88" dur="6.45">repentance there&amp;#39;s no real like rending</text>
  <text start="272.42" dur="6.24">of the heart seeking yon and and saying</text>
  <text start="275.33" dur="4.8">Oh have mercy on us and so I really</text>
  <text start="278.66" dur="3.09">think you know it&amp;#39;s not a coincidence</text>
  <text start="280.13" dur="3.51">that all of these judgments seem to</text>
  <text start="281.75" dur="4.44">start hitting the nation right here in</text>
  <text start="283.64" dur="4.82">the jubilee year as we&amp;#39;re now crossing</text>
  <text start="286.19" dur="5.73">in toward the fall of the Jubilee year</text>
  <text start="288.46" dur="6.15">2017 as if Yash is saying you know what</text>
  <text start="291.92" dur="4.86">time is up time is up</text>
  <text start="294.61" dur="4">so I just thought I&amp;#39;d make this YouTube</text>
  <text start="296.78" dur="4.38">not to just point out the obvious but</text>
  <text start="298.61" dur="4.26">also just to encourage those you know if</text>
  <text start="301.16" dur="3.87">you are backslidden or you know you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="302.87" dur="4.02">lost your first love man seek him get on</text>
  <text start="305.03" dur="4.77">your face and get close to him get</text>
  <text start="306.89" dur="4.53">intimate with them because we&amp;#39;re not in</text>
  <text start="309.8" dur="3.26">the Great Tribulation these are just</text>
  <text start="311.42" dur="4.86">birth pangs that are increasing</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="5.55">increasing with frequency so this is</text>
  <text start="316.28" dur="5.33">nothing compared to what it will become</text>
  <text start="318.61" dur="5.41">so the time to get close to him is now</text>
  <text start="321.61" dur="3.91">this is the angle John Lee with Torah</text>
