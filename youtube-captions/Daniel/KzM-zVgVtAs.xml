  <text start="63.18" dur="3.72">his word framed all the world&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="65.519" dur="4.941">everything that does appear it to be</text>

  <text start="85.53" dur="3.479">there is a there is a there is a</text>
  <text start="87.36" dur="3.06">counterfeit faith there&amp;#39;s a faith of</text>
  <text start="89.009" dur="3.15">Devil&amp;#39;s which is talked about in the</text>
  <text start="90.42" dur="5.04">book of James which is where they</text>
  <text start="92.159" dur="5.1">tremble at yah but they and they believe</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="3.449">that yah is real but they don&amp;#39;t obey Him</text>
  <text start="97.259" dur="5.36">but now we&amp;#39;re going to see what true</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="7.081">faith is this true obedient faith and</text>
  <text start="102.619" dur="6.161">here we going to go ah verse 4 by faith</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="5.64">Abel offered unto yah a more excellent</text>
  <text start="108.78" dur="4.92">sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="5.099">witness that he was righteous yah</text>
  <text start="113.7" dur="6.809">testifying of his gifts and by it he</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="6.39">being dead yet speaks hallelujah so we</text>
  <text start="120.509" dur="4.47">know able you know Abel wanted to give</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="3.661">the best he gave the best he gave the</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="3.961">sacrifice that was not only the best but</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="5.41">the sacrifice that was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="128.94" dur="5.17">offered k enable both knew from</text>
  <text start="132.19" dur="3.6">the sin of their parents that it was a</text>
  <text start="134.11" dur="3.6">blood sacrifice that needed to be</text>
  <text start="135.79" dur="4.29">offered because when Adam and Eve sinned</text>
  <text start="137.71" dur="4.4">of course yah had two slain animal which</text>
  <text start="140.08" dur="4.26">I believe was a lamb and clothed them</text>
  <text start="142.11" dur="4.6">with the lambskins the shedding of blood</text>
  <text start="144.34" dur="4.32">was needed and so Abel offered a blood</text>
  <text start="146.71" dur="3.81">sacrifice and Cain did not can offer</text>
  <text start="148.66" dur="3.54">just what he thought he could do you</text>
  <text start="150.52" dur="3.36">know he decided to go a different way</text>
  <text start="152.2" dur="4.29">and bent his own way which was his</text>
  <text start="153.88" dur="5.04">vegetables but Abel decided to do what</text>
  <text start="156.49" dur="4.86">ya said and that is one of the best</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="4.68">examples of faith that you can possibly</text>
  <text start="161.35" dur="5.67">look at because what is faith other than</text>
  <text start="163.6" dur="4.83">doing what yah tells you to do believing</text>
  <text start="167.02" dur="3.87">in him enough and trusting in him enough</text>
  <text start="168.43" dur="5.58">to do what he says to do and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="170.89" dur="5.58">exactly what Abel did verse 5 by faith</text>
  <text start="174.01" dur="5.58">Enoch was translated that he should not</text>
  <text start="176.47" dur="5.28">see death and was not found because</text>
  <text start="179.59" dur="4.2">yahoo had translated him for before his</text>
  <text start="181.75" dur="6.84">translation he had this testimony that</text>
  <text start="183.79" dur="6.78">he pleased yeah Enoch please John and of</text>
  <text start="188.59" dur="5.1">course without faith it is impossible to</text>
  <text start="190.57" dur="5.22">please yah so we know Enoch had complete</text>
  <text start="193.69" dur="4.68">and total trust in yacht to the point</text>
  <text start="195.79" dur="5.669">where he didn&amp;#39;t even see death he never</text>
  <text start="198.37" dur="4.95">died yeah I did not allow the wages of</text>
  <text start="201.459" dur="8.821">sin to come upon him which is death</text>
  <text start="203.32" dur="8.16">because he pleased yah hallelujah of</text>
  <text start="210.28" dur="2.94">course I believe he&amp;#39;s one of the two</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="4.47">witnesses so I think he will eventually</text>
  <text start="213.22" dur="4.76">see death but it will be in a way that</text>
  <text start="215.95" dur="7.62">just told him completely glorifies yah</text>
  <text start="217.98" dur="7.81">just like Josh was death was verse 6 but</text>
  <text start="223.57" dur="4.83">without faith it is impossible to please</text>
  <text start="225.79" dur="5.94">him hallelujah but he that comes Diaw</text>
  <text start="228.4" dur="5.04">must believe that he is and that he is a</text>
  <text start="231.73" dur="4.41">rewarder of them that diligently seek</text>
  <text start="233.44" dur="4.98">Him so we see here that faith is two</text>
  <text start="236.14" dur="4.83">components number one that you believe</text>
  <text start="238.42" dur="5.19">that he is that you believe that he is</text>
  <text start="240.97" dur="4.68">who he speaks of himself as throughout</text>
  <text start="243.61" dur="4.23">the scriptures that you believe he is</text>
  <text start="245.65" dur="3.9">that he is the great I am and not only</text>
  <text start="247.84" dur="3.48">that you believe that he is but that he</text>
  <text start="249.55" dur="5.64">is rewarded of them that diligently seek</text>
  <text start="251.32" dur="6.36">Him and that&amp;#39;s exactly what he does</text>
  <text start="255.19" dur="5.46">those who set their hearts like like</text>
  <text start="257.68" dur="4.68">flint 22 against the enemy and tenderly</text>
  <text start="260.65" dur="3.45">toward yah in seeking him with</text>
  <text start="262.36" dur="3.51">everything that&amp;#39;s in them those are the</text>
  <text start="264.1" dur="4.83">people that get rewarded by yacht</text>
  <text start="265.87" dur="4.94">he wants to be a god that&amp;#39;s he want he</text>
  <text start="268.93" dur="4.56">is a God that wants to be sought after</text>
  <text start="270.81" dur="7.329">he wants us to seek after him to pursue</text>
  <text start="273.49" dur="6.39">him this is why he wants us to study his</text>
  <text start="278.139" dur="4.201">word this is why he wants us on a daily</text>
  <text start="279.88" dur="5.52">basis to come before him in our private</text>
  <text start="282.34" dur="4.38">prayer times and in our you know I love</text>
  <text start="285.4" dur="3.78">the statement that Keith Green mate</text>
  <text start="286.72" dur="4.169">where he said if you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="289.18" dur="4.83">bother to come to yah every day then</text>
  <text start="290.889" dur="4.621">don&amp;#39;t bother coming to him at all so if</text>
  <text start="294.01" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re not going to bother to believe</text>
  <text start="295.51" dur="4.529">that those who diligently seek Him are</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="5.16">rewarded by him then what&amp;#39;s the point of</text>
  <text start="300.039" dur="5.641">serving him because the whole aspect of</text>
  <text start="302.77" dur="4.47">true saving faith is you are not cold</text>
  <text start="305.68" dur="3.33">but you&amp;#39;re hot you&amp;#39;re not lukewarm but</text>
  <text start="307.24" dur="3.45">you&amp;#39;re hot you&amp;#39;re seeking him with all</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s in you and you&amp;#39;re doing it on a</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="7.56">daily basis and you&amp;#39;re involving him in</text>
  <text start="313.9" dur="6.9">all your life that is true faith verse 7</text>
  <text start="318.25" dur="5.88">by faith Noah being warned of yacht of</text>
  <text start="320.8" dur="4.44">things not seen as yet only didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="324.13" dur="3.569">that there was going to be a flood he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="325.24" dur="4.59">never seen a flood that concept was</text>
  <text start="327.699" dur="3.451">completely alien to his mind and to all</text>
  <text start="329.83" dur="4.62">the minds of those who live under for</text>
  <text start="331.15" dur="5.61">the time yet mood with fear prepared an</text>
  <text start="334.45" dur="3.96">ark to the saving of his house by the</text>
  <text start="336.76" dur="4.26">which he condemned the world and became</text>
  <text start="338.41" dur="6.96">heir of the righteousness which is by</text>
  <text start="341.02" dur="5.82">faith so no I believed in you I even</text>
  <text start="345.37" dur="2.94">though he didn&amp;#39;t see the evidence of any</text>
  <text start="346.84" dur="3.6">type of flood that had ever hit the</text>
  <text start="348.31" dur="5.01">earth before but he believed in yon and</text>
  <text start="350.44" dur="5.009">trusted in him and so that was true</text>
  <text start="353.32" dur="4.17">faith that&amp;#39;s what caused him to again</text>
  <text start="355.449" dur="5.011">obey yacht to do what yacht told him to</text>
  <text start="357.49" dur="6.63">do which is building the boat verse 8 by</text>
  <text start="360.46" dur="5.34">faith Abraham when he was called to go</text>

  <text start="365.8" dur="6.149">after receive for inheritance obeyed</text>
  <text start="369.599" dur="5.231">which he should after receive for</text>
  <text start="371.949" dur="6.601">inheritance obeyed and he went out not</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="6.24">knowing whither he went and by faith he</text>
  <text start="378.55" dur="4.89">sojourned in the land of promise as in a</text>
  <text start="381.07" dur="5.069">strange country dwelling in Tabernacles</text>
  <text start="383.44" dur="5.64">with Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him</text>

  <text start="395.349" dur="4.461">clue where he was going he had never</text>
  <text start="397.35" dur="4.38">been to this land before yah basically</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="3.99">told him to drop everything to leave it</text>
  <text start="401.73" dur="3.54">to uproot his entire family to leave</text>
  <text start="403.8" dur="3.99">everything that was familiar to him and</text>
  <text start="405.27" dur="4.71">everything that he had known and go into</text>
  <text start="407.79" dur="3.84">this land that was very strange a lot of</text>
  <text start="409.98" dur="3.03">strange people were there he had no idea</text>
  <text start="411.63" dur="3.48">where he was going to go and yet he</text>
  <text start="413.01" dur="5.67">obeyed listed the yacht and he did that</text>

  <text start="418.68" dur="5.16">followed yog with us forever yacht let</text>
  <text start="420.81" dur="5.43">him hallelujah because Abraham knew that</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="4.5">this life that he was living was not the</text>
  <text start="426.24" dur="5.64">end-all or be all he was looking toward</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="4.77">that city whose builder and maker is</text>
  <text start="431.88" dur="3.39">yeah which of course is the New</text>
  <text start="433.11" dur="4.2">Jerusalem that&amp;#39;s where his heart and his</text>
  <text start="435.27" dur="4.77">mind was focused on the New Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="437.31" dur="4.56">and so it was no big deal that he</text>
  <text start="440.04" dur="3.09">uprooted his family and no big deal that</text>
  <text start="441.87" dur="3.3">he went into a land that he&amp;#39;d know about</text>
  <text start="443.13" dur="4.62">because that wasn&amp;#39;t what life was about</text>
  <text start="445.17" dur="5.52">anyway it wasn&amp;#39;t about you know getting</text>
  <text start="447.75" dur="4.83">a retirement plan and you know building</text>
  <text start="450.69" dur="5.46">up his own legacy in his own family and</text>
  <text start="452.58" dur="5.28">in the wealthy city of Babylon or an</text>
  <text start="456.15" dur="4.2">earlier which is where he and his family</text>
  <text start="457.86" dur="5.16">were from he was willing to give all</text>
  <text start="460.35" dur="4.89">that up because his heart was in the New</text>
  <text start="463.02" dur="7.01">Jerusalem not in the present life</text>
  <text start="465.24" dur="7.8">hallelujah verse 11 through faith also</text>
  <text start="470.03" dur="6.04">Sara herself received strength to</text>
  <text start="473.04" dur="5.49">conceive seed and was delivered of a</text>
  <text start="476.07" dur="6.23">child when she was past age because she</text>
  <text start="478.53" dur="6.93">judged him faithful who had promised</text>
  <text start="482.3" dur="4.42">there for spring so this is a very</text>
  <text start="485.46" dur="5.36">significant verse because if you</text>
  <text start="486.72" dur="6.42">remember when yah visited Abraham and</text>
  <text start="490.82" dur="4.12">reminded him and his wife again in the</text>
  <text start="493.14" dur="3.84">tent that that they were going to</text>
  <text start="494.94" dur="4.17">conceive in about a year from the point</text>
  <text start="496.98" dur="4.5">that he visited them Sarah at first she</text>
  <text start="499.11" dur="3.9">laughed she laughed because she couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="501.48" dur="4.56">believe if that was what was going to</text>
  <text start="503.01" dur="8.01">happen but we see that Sarah overcame</text>
  <text start="506.04" dur="7.08">that and and she she judged yah faithful</text>
  <text start="511.02" dur="4.29">she she knew at that after that point</text>
  <text start="513.12" dur="3.51">for that visitation that she was going</text>
  <text start="515.31" dur="3.33">to conceive that she was going to have</text>
  <text start="516.63" dur="4.05">that child even though she was 90 years</text>
  <text start="518.64" dur="4.92">old and no woman would ever have a child</text>
  <text start="520.68" dur="4.77">that old but she believed in yah she</text>
  <text start="523.56" dur="3.6">judged him faithful she knew that he was</text>
  <text start="525.45" dur="3.12">going to be again but not only that he</text>
  <text start="527.16" dur="3.42">was but he was going to be a row</text>
  <text start="528.57" dur="3.66">order of those that diligently seek Him</text>
  <text start="530.58" dur="8.78">and so Sarah trust in that and so she</text>

  <text start="549.56" dur="4.51">that&amp;#39;s a referring to Isaac there one as</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="3">good as dead because remember one of the</text>
  <text start="554.07" dur="3.72">greatest acts of faith that Abraham had</text>
  <text start="555.54" dur="4.47">to endure was when y&amp;#39;all called Abraham</text>
  <text start="557.79" dur="4.41">to sacrifice his son Isaac and Abraham</text>
  <text start="560.01" dur="4.74">obeyed trusting and believing that yah</text>
  <text start="562.2" dur="5.76">if y&amp;#39;all had to he would raise Isaac</text>
