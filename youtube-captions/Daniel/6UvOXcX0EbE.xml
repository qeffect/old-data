  <text start="8.13" dur="4.919">about halfway almost halfway through the</text>
  <text start="10.11" dur="5.58">60 per month and you&amp;#39;re looking at a map</text>
  <text start="13.049" dur="5.131">NASA recently published which shows</text>
  <text start="15.69" dur="5.009">where we are in relation to all the</text>
  <text start="18.18" dur="5.189">other galaxies in the universe and all</text>
  <text start="20.699" dur="5.521">the other superclusters of galaxies in</text>
  <text start="23.369" dur="4.441">the in the known universe so the arrow</text>

  <text start="27.81" dur="5.88">pointing to our galaxy the Milky Way</text>
  <text start="30.72" dur="5.67">galaxy it&amp;#39;s on the very tip as you can</text>
  <text start="33.69" dur="4.68">see there on the map and shows its</text>
  <text start="36.39" dur="4.32">relation to all the other galaxies in</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="5.849">what we know of the universe right now</text>
  <text start="40.71" dur="6">and as I looked at this image kind of</text>
  <text start="44.219" dur="4.561">looks like an upside down p or maybe</text>
  <text start="46.71" dur="4.89">Abby I thought oh this looks an awful</text>
  <text start="48.78" dur="6.81">lot like a hebrew letter and if you go</text>
  <text start="51.6" dur="5.7">here this is the alphabet for the paleo</text>
  <text start="55.59" dur="3.57">hebrew alphabet so it&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="57.3" dur="4.38">different from the way modern hebrew</text>
  <text start="59.16" dur="4.98">appears because paleo hebrew is how</text>
  <text start="61.68" dur="4.41">hebrew was written thousands of years</text>
  <text start="64.14" dur="4.53">ago by the children of Israel if you go</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="5.52">to the very top row and up in the upper</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="5.489">right hand corner not Aleph but the</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="5.31">letter next to aleph bet which is the</text>
  <text start="74.159" dur="4.681">second letter in the Hebrew alphabet it</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="3.78">looks an awful lot like a hebrew bet</text>
  <text start="78.84" dur="4.2">maybe it&amp;#39;s sort of kind of turned upside</text>
  <text start="80.7" dur="5.309">down but it very much looks like the way</text>
  <text start="83.04" dur="6.42">a bet was written and what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="86.009" dur="7.231">as you can see is that a bet means house</text>
  <text start="89.46" dur="7.049">or house of so examples in Scripture</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="5.699">that you see are Beth Israel which means</text>
  <text start="96.509" dur="5.011">house of Israel or there&amp;#39;s even a city</text>
  <text start="98.939" dur="4.621">called beth-el which means house of God</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="5.76">house of yeah so it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
