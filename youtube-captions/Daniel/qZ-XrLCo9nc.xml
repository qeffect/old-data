  <text start="2.429" dur="5.191">with Torah restoration ministries it is</text>
  <text start="4.11" dur="5.64">the weekly Sabbath October 7th 2017 and</text>
  <text start="7.62" dur="4.74">it is the third day of Sukkot I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="9.75" dur="5.429">reminded of that verse in the minor</text>
  <text start="12.36" dur="5.73">prophets that says in two days he will</text>
  <text start="15.179" dur="6.36">revive us but on the third day he will</text>
  <text start="18.09" dur="5.16">lift us up and also on Mount Sinai</text>
  <text start="21.539" dur="3.57">just before Shavuot he said sanctify</text>
  <text start="23.25" dur="4.949">yourself today and tomorrow and on the</text>
  <text start="25.109" dur="4.651">third day come before me so I really</text>
  <text start="28.199" dur="3.15">believe that this third day of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="29.76" dur="4.59">that happens to fall on the weekly</text>
  <text start="31.349" dur="5.131">Sabbath this year is gonna be very</text>
  <text start="34.35" dur="4.229">special in terms of his spirit moving on</text>
  <text start="36.48" dur="4.649">his people I wanted to just share</text>
  <text start="38.579" dur="4.41">something really quickly that yah spoke</text>
  <text start="41.129" dur="4.41">to me as I woke up in the early morning</text>
  <text start="42.989" dur="4.98">hours and was just spending time with</text>
  <text start="45.539" dur="10.471">him on this third day of Sukkot this</text>
  <text start="47.969" dur="9.84">shabbat shalom and he he said you</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="5.16">noticed how this year for the feast of</text>
  <text start="57.809" dur="5.221">Sukkot it began on a Thursday started on</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="4.04">a Wednesday night but you know on a</text>
  <text start="63.03" dur="4.89">Thursday on a fifth day of the week and</text>
  <text start="65.21" dur="5.74">and then he says notice how eight days</text>
  <text start="67.92" dur="5.34">later it ends on a Thursday Wednesday</text>
  <text start="70.95" dur="3.8">night into Thursday night on a fifth day</text>
  <text start="73.26" dur="3.99">the weekend and then he said Daniel</text>
  <text start="74.75" dur="3.939">remember the scripture says one days is</text>
  <text start="77.25" dur="3.99">a thousand years and a thousand years is</text>
  <text start="78.689" dur="5.04">one day to Yahweh so what happened in</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="4.169">the fifth millennium and I thought oh</text>
  <text start="83.729" dur="4.5">the fifth millennium that was the</text>
  <text start="85.409" dur="4.471">millennium that started with the acts of</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="5.371">the Jewish apostles with the book of</text>
  <text start="89.88" dur="7.14">Acts and he said there&amp;#39;s a reason why</text>
  <text start="93.6" dur="5.72">the Sukkot and this Jubilee began on the</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="5.73">fifth day and ends on the fifth day</text>
  <text start="99.32" dur="6.339">because the fifth millennium began with</text>
  <text start="102.75" dur="4.86">the book of Acts you know the Jewish</text>
  <text start="105.659" dur="3.841">apostles just mightily filled with the</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="3.06">spirit doing signs and wonders and</text>
  <text start="109.5" dur="3.06">healings and raising people from the</text>
  <text start="110.67" dur="4.29">dead it says even Peter and Paul shadow</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="3.75">it would touch on people and they would</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="3.18">be healed and of course they were</text>
  <text start="116.31" dur="4.019">preaching the fullness of you know</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="4.049">Yahshua crucified and resurrected and</text>
  <text start="120.329" dur="3.631">walking in the fullness of Torah and</text>
  <text start="122.189" dur="3.54">then the gifts and fruit of the Spirit</text>
  <text start="123.96" dur="4.2">it was it was it was the way it should</text>
  <text start="125.729" dur="5.701">be right and he said the reason why</text>
  <text start="128.16" dur="4.54">Sukkot Jubilee is it starts on the fifth</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="3.4">millennium as it were and</text>
  <text start="132.7" dur="4.44">ends on the fifth millennium is because</text>
  <text start="134.83" dur="4.68">the book of Acts is about to be</text>
  <text start="137.14" dur="4.95">rekindled it&amp;#39;s about to be rekindled</text>
  <text start="139.51" dur="4.29">only it&amp;#39;s gonna be greater than the book</text>
  <text start="142.09" dur="5.369">of Acts you know we read in Daniel that</text>
  <text start="143.8" dur="5.07">in the last days that those who stand</text>
  <text start="147.459" dur="4.86">against the son of perdition they will</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="6.089">do mighty exploits Joshua even says you</text>
  <text start="152.319" dur="4.051">know you see my great works but you will</text>
  <text start="154.959" dur="2.671">do even greater than these and the</text>
  <text start="156.37" dur="4.38">reason why is because Yahshua is just</text>
  <text start="157.63" dur="4.889">you know one bodily person on earth and</text>
  <text start="160.75" dur="4.62">and and and the greater would be that</text>
  <text start="162.519" dur="5.671">now his comforter would spread to the</text>
  <text start="165.37" dur="5.339">multitude you know but it&amp;#39;s but this</text>
  <text start="168.19" dur="5.609">latter rain that will that will begin</text>
  <text start="170.709" dur="5.071">here soon the latter rain and the former</text>
  <text start="173.799" dur="5.731">rain I mean it&amp;#39;s gonna dwarf what we saw</text>
  <text start="175.78" dur="6.269">in the first century because now the</text>
  <text start="179.53" dur="5.34">bride is a full-grown woman and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.049" dur="4.231">gonna be where sin abounds grace that</text>
  <text start="184.87" dur="5.07">much more balanced so as you have the</text>
  <text start="186.28" dur="5.429">son of perdition arise and rule for for</text>
  <text start="189.94" dur="3.359">his time and you have these beginning of</text>
  <text start="191.709" dur="2.221">Sorrows that transition into the Great</text>
  <text start="193.299" dur="2.851">Tribulation</text>
  <text start="193.93" dur="4.649">although sin abounds more than we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="196.15" dur="3.63">ever seen it before grace that much more</text>
  <text start="198.579" dur="3.301">will abound so it&amp;#39;s gonna be even</text>
  <text start="199.78" dur="4.59">greater than the book of Acts so the</text>
  <text start="201.88" dur="4.139">book of Acts will be rekindled is what I</text>
  <text start="204.37" dur="3.959">think he&amp;#39;s trying to communicate by</text>
  <text start="206.019" dur="4.681">starting Sukkot the Jubilee Sukkot of</text>
  <text start="208.329" dur="4.771">2017 on the fifth millennium and ending</text>
  <text start="210.7" dur="5.48">eight days later on the fifth millennium</text>
  <text start="213.1" dur="5.789">so that should encourage you seek Him</text>
  <text start="216.18" dur="2.98">get close to him get all sin out of your</text>
  <text start="218.889" dur="3.211">life</text>
  <text start="219.16" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t play games just just pray without</text>
  <text start="222.1" dur="2.759">ceasing and get so intimate with him</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="3.87">join with those believers who are like</text>
  <text start="224.859" dur="5.25">that and and you will you will begin to</text>
  <text start="227.41" dur="4.29">see that his Spirit will pour on you it</text>
  <text start="230.109" dur="4.081">started raining this morning and I was</text>
  <text start="231.7" dur="4.8">reminded of the song of Moses in the</text>
  <text start="234.19" dur="5.04">Torah where it says your doctrine shall</text>
  <text start="236.5" dur="6.75">drop as the rain and and your words</text>
  <text start="239.23" dur="6.509">shall distill as the dew as we learn his</text>
  <text start="243.25" dur="4.44">word and we apply it to our lives and we</text>
  <text start="245.739" dur="5.791">walk in his Torah out of a love for</text>
  <text start="247.69" dur="6.03">Jesus Yahshua then his spirit begins to</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="4.459">just fill us more and more and more and</text>
  <text start="253.72" dur="4.889">the fruits of the Ruach love joy peace</text>
  <text start="255.989" dur="4.541">goodness kindness gentleness patience</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="3.901">self-control meekness faith all these</text>
  <text start="260.53" dur="2.34">fruits begin to ripen more and warn our</text>
  <text start="262.51" dur="2.73">life</text>
  <text start="262.87" dur="5.579">and we start walking more than the gifts</text>
  <text start="265.24" dur="5.28">of the Ruach of the Holy Spirit and then</text>
  <text start="268.449" dur="3.661">that compels us to get closer to Messiah</text>
  <text start="270.52" dur="3.06">the Messiah forms in himself more</text>
  <text start="272.11" dur="4.29">perfectly and that&amp;#39;s an it&amp;#39;s all it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="273.58" dur="5.88">all him but we grow in both the Holy</text>
  <text start="276.4" dur="4.62">Spirit and in obeying his Torah as much</text>
  <text start="279.46" dur="3.63">of the Torah as we can in our modern day</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="4.59">culture and as we do that we&amp;#39;ll start</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="5.1">seeing these signs and wonders to bring</text>
  <text start="285.61" dur="3.6">people to him to edify the body because</text>
  <text start="288.19" dur="3.57">remember when the son of perdition</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="3.81">arises he will have lying signs and</text>
  <text start="291.76" dur="4.35">wonders he&amp;#39;s gonna be able to call down</text>
  <text start="293.02" dur="4.619">fire from the sky like Elijah of old it</text>
  <text start="296.11" dur="4.8">says he&amp;#39;s going to have all sorts of</text>
  <text start="297.639" dur="5.34">miracles lying signs and wonders and</text>
  <text start="300.91" dur="3.36">this is going to be a delusion a great</text>
  <text start="302.979" dur="2.371">delusion that y&amp;#39;all orchestrate so</text>
  <text start="304.27" dur="4.89">before we get to that</text>
  <text start="305.35" dur="5.73">yaws gonna allow his people israel to</text>
  <text start="309.16" dur="3.36">have that one last you know book of Acts</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="3.36">experience but it&amp;#39;s going to be even</text>
  <text start="312.52" dur="4.32">greater than the book of Acts and and</text>
  <text start="314.44" dur="4.92">even after the Great Tribulation starts</text>
  <text start="316.84" dur="4.949">we know that there will be those like in</text>
  <text start="319.36" dur="4.05">Smyrna who in Daniel 11 will instruct</text>
  <text start="321.789" dur="2.88">many and teach and they&amp;#39;ll fall by the</text>
  <text start="323.41" dur="3.03">flame in the sword but they&amp;#39;ll be doing</text>
  <text start="324.669" dur="4.62">mighty exploits even in the midst and we</text>
  <text start="326.44" dur="5.19">see even the two witnesses are you know</text>
  <text start="329.289" dur="3.75">shutting up the sky and and and turning</text>
  <text start="331.63" dur="4.349">water to blood I mean they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="333.039" dur="4.56">these huge like Moses like signs that</text>
  <text start="335.979" dur="3.781">you know you never really see being done</text>
  <text start="337.599" dur="4.531">in the book of Acts so this this</text>
