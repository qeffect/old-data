  <text start="52.32" dur="5">share with you on the Sabbath day it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="54.84" dur="5.82">something that Yahweh revealed to me</text>
  <text start="57.32" dur="5.62">just a couple nights ago as I was just</text>
  <text start="60.66" dur="5.22">meditating on him sitting in this lush</text>

  <text start="72.72" dur="4.85">throughout this week and all over my</text>
  <text start="74.79" dur="5.939">website I do believe that yom teruah</text>
  <text start="77.57" dur="5.95">2017 is the year that Yahshua will</text>
  <text start="80.729" dur="4.441">return for his bride and I&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="83.52" dur="4.43">talked about how Yahweh has his</text>
  <text start="85.17" dur="6.18">thumbprint on everything now I</text>
  <text start="87.95" dur="6.04">understand that the scriptures were not</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="5.64">numbered until much later after they</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="6.93">were written that&amp;#39;s fine Yahweh has this</text>
  <text start="96.99" dur="5.82">thumb print on everything if you look at</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="5.19">the first five books of the Scriptures</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="5.849">the Torah as we call it and if you</text>
  <text start="106.11" dur="4.86">looked at the Gospels in the Brit</text>
  <text start="108.659" dur="4.201">hadashah or the New Covenant the renewed</text>
  <text start="110.97" dur="7.109">covenant there&amp;#39;s something very special</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="7.74">about the number 17 in Genesis 17 you</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="4.68">have the Covenant of circumcision you</text>
  <text start="120.6" dur="6.119">have the promise of Isaac given to</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="6.691">Abraham and Abraham and Sarah get new</text>
  <text start="126.719" dur="5.791">names sir I gets Sarah</text>
  <text start="129.45" dur="6.33">and Avram gets Abraham now what happens</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="6.059">in 2017 when Yahshua comes to redeem us</text>
  <text start="135.78" dur="5.4">he will give us new names that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.569" dur="6.241">according to the book of Revelation the</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="5.85">whole concept of circumcision is a</text>
  <text start="144.81" dur="4.649">shadow picture that points toward the</text>
  <text start="147.03" dur="5.51">resurrection when we become ultimately</text>
  <text start="149.459" dur="7.471">circumcised with our brand new bodies</text>
  <text start="152.54" dur="8.13">Alleluia so Genesis 17 is all about</text>
  <text start="156.93" dur="6.75">yahshua&amp;#39;s return now look at Exodus 17</text>
  <text start="160.67" dur="5.56">this is where Moe Shay strikes the rock</text>
  <text start="163.68" dur="4.43">in obedience to Yahweh and living waters</text>
  <text start="166.23" dur="3.75">gush out from the rock and the</text>
  <text start="168.11" dur="4.18">Israelites are able to drink in the</text>
  <text start="169.98" dur="5.13">desert and what happens when Yahshua</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="4.85">returns in 2017 we read that there will</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="5.07">be living waters that will gush out from</text>
  <text start="177.14" dur="6.819">Jerusalem both to the east and to the</text>
  <text start="180.18" dur="8.55">west so Exodus 17 is all about Yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.959" dur="6.901">return in 2017 look at Leviticus 17 the</text>
  <text start="188.73" dur="4.17">Vegas 17 is all about how all the</text>
  <text start="190.86" dur="4.349">sacrifices need to be brought to the</text>
  <text start="192.9" dur="4.919">tabernacle you see the Israelites were</text>
  <text start="195.209" dur="4.381">sacrificing in different fields and</text>
  <text start="197.819" dur="3.061">different places and Yahweh said no I</text>
  <text start="199.59" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t want this to happen it&amp;#39;s too easy</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="4.77">to get off track and start sacrificing</text>
  <text start="203.22" dur="4.68">to other gods all the sacrifices that</text>
  <text start="205.65" dur="4.919">anyone makes needs to be brought up to</text>
  <text start="207.9" dur="4.86">the priests at the tabernacle well what</text>
  <text start="210.569" dur="5.131">will happen when Yahshua returns he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="4.559">going to restore the temple and all the</text>
  <text start="215.7" dur="3.539">animal sacrifices will be done in</text>
  <text start="217.319" dur="4.531">Jerusalem according to Zechariah chapter</text>
  <text start="219.239" dur="4.261">14 of course these animal sacrifices</text>
  <text start="221.85" dur="3.33">won&amp;#39;t replace the atonement that Yash</text>
  <text start="223.5" dur="3.12">was already made for us they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="225.18" dur="3.48">immediately pointed back toward what</text>
  <text start="226.62" dur="3.69">Yahshua did as a memorial and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="228.66" dur="5.04">also be used to praise yahweh such as</text>
  <text start="230.31" dur="6.45">the evening and morning ablation look at</text>
  <text start="233.7" dur="4.59">numbers 17 this is where the priesthood</text>
  <text start="236.76" dur="3.599">is firmly established there was</text>
  <text start="238.29" dur="5.039">murmuring going on in the nation of</text>
  <text start="240.359" dur="6.511">Israel and Aaron&amp;#39;s rod of all the 12</text>
  <text start="243.329" dur="5.31">rods it alone buds and blossoms what</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="4.979">will Yahshua do according to Malachi 3</text>
  <text start="248.639" dur="6.03">when he returns he&amp;#39;s going to purge and</text>
  <text start="251.849" dur="4.801">restore the Levitical priesthood and in</text>
  <text start="254.669" dur="4.5">fact he will be the high priest not of</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="4.23">the order of Leviticus but of the</text>
  <text start="259.169" dur="2.581">Levitical priesthood but of McHale</text>
  <text start="260.88" dur="2.43">tzadik he</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="2.94">will be the great high priest so the</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="6.24">priesthood will be established from your</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="6.78">insurance and look at Deuteronomy 17 if</text>
  <text start="269.55" dur="3.69">you read in that passage as you get</text>
  <text start="271.47" dur="4.8">toward the end there&amp;#39;s specific</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="5.16">instructions for the king what a king</text>
  <text start="276.27" dur="4.56">should do and one of those instructions</text>
  <text start="278.4" dur="4.56">that a king is supposed to record a book</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="4.23">that contains all the commandments all</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="4.11">the instructions from the Torah and this</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="4.26">King is to meditate upon that Torah all</text>
  <text start="287.07" dur="4.8">the day that he doesn&amp;#39;t turn to the left</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="4.77">or the right and what will Yahshua do</text>
  <text start="291.87" dur="5.52">when he rules and reigns he will cause</text>
  <text start="294.09" dur="5.61">the Torah to go forth from Zion and so</text>
  <text start="297.39" dur="6.54">Deuteronomy 17 is all about yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.7" dur="9.03">return all five books of the Torah point</text>
  <text start="303.93" dur="7.92">toward 2017 and then we have a second</text>
  <text start="308.73" dur="5.64">witness look in the New Testament the</text>
  <text start="311.85" dur="7.52">Brit hadashah the renewed covenant in</text>
  <text start="314.37" dur="7.98">the Gospels Matthew 17 this is Yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="4.24">Transfiguration this completely points</text>
  <text start="322.35" dur="4.65">toward the resurrection when we all</text>
  <text start="323.61" dur="7.65">become like Yahshua where we receive our</text>
  <text start="327" dur="6.72">renewed resurrected bodies now mark</text>
  <text start="331.26" dur="6.3">doesn&amp;#39;t have 17 chapters but look at</text>
  <text start="333.72" dur="5.67">Luke 17 Luke 17 Yahshua specifically</text>
  <text start="337.56" dur="4.68">tells those who are listening to him</text>
  <text start="339.39" dur="5.43">that he will return as lightning flashes</text>
  <text start="342.24" dur="5.7">across the sky he directly points toward</text>
  <text start="344.82" dur="5.58">a second return on Luke 17 in John</text>
  <text start="347.94" dur="4.289">chapter 17 it&amp;#39;s Yahshua sprayer to his</text>
  <text start="350.4" dur="4.26">father where he prays that just as</text>
  <text start="352.229" dur="4.291">Yahshua and his father are one that all</text>
  <text start="354.66" dur="5.1">those who are in Messiah will also be</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="7.8">one what will happen when Yasha returns</text>
  <text start="359.76" dur="6.63">we will be one with him now since mark</text>
  <text start="364.32" dur="4.5">didn&amp;#39;t have 17 chapters I was curious to</text>
  <text start="366.39" dur="4.08">see if there would be another witness to</text>
  <text start="368.82" dur="5.93">the the three Gospels that I mentioned</text>
  <text start="370.47" dur="7.53">and lo and behold in Acts chapter 17</text>
  <text start="374.75" dur="5.41">it&amp;#39;s preached by Paul that Yahshua will</text>
  <text start="378" dur="5.93">come to judge and he preaches</text>
  <text start="380.16" dur="3.77">specifically about the resurrection</text>
  <text start="384.08" dur="10.47">all of these chapters 17 17 17 they all</text>
  <text start="389.93" dur="8.28">point toward 2017 when Yahshua will</text>
  <text start="394.55" dur="6.989">return well I suppose you could call</text>
  <text start="398.21" dur="5.28">that coincidence but as you continue to</text>
  <text start="401.539" dur="3.6">walk in the Rue ack as you continue to</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="3">get closer to Yahweh you start to learn</text>
  <text start="405.139" dur="4.951">that there&amp;#39;s no such thing as</text>
  <text start="406.49" dur="5.479">coincidence in fact even any good</text>
  <text start="410.09" dur="4.259">private detective will tell you that</text>
  <text start="411.969" dur="4.361">Yahweh does have his thumbprint and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.349" dur="3.57">pointing toward a very specific time I</text>
  <text start="416.33" dur="2.67">know there&amp;#39;s been a lot of false</text>
  <text start="417.919" dur="2.791">prophets and there&amp;#39;s been a lot of</text>
  <text start="419" dur="2.819">people saying this and that and pointing</text>
  <text start="420.71" dur="3.03">toward this and that there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="421.819" dur="5.871">distractions and finally people just say</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="6.239">you know what no one knows well in fact</text>
  <text start="427.69" dur="4.449">Yahweh is making it very clear to his</text>
