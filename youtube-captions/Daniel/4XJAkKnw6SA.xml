  <text start="17.97" dur="5.25">do the best I can I have very very busy</text>

  <text start="26.25" dur="4.38">and in ministry but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="29.13" dur="2.729">goal not so i&amp;#39;m going to try to do and</text>
  <text start="30.63" dur="2.76">who knows maybe I&amp;#39;ll even be able to do</text>
  <text start="31.859" dur="4.801">it more frequently than than every</text>
  <text start="33.39" dur="5.579">Shabbat but nevertheless this is the</text>
  <text start="36.66" dur="3.69">first part the introduction to the 17</text>
  <text start="38.969" dur="5.101">part series that I sort of gave a</text>
  <text start="40.35" dur="7.02">preview for a little bit ago and this is</text>
  <text start="44.07" dur="6.69">the series that I&amp;#39;m making that&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="47.37" dur="5.7">Messiah and Paul reconciling their</text>
  <text start="50.76" dur="3.6">teachings something that&amp;#39;s really been</text>
  <text start="53.07" dur="3.419">on my heart that you had spent on my</text>
  <text start="54.36" dur="4.109">heart that I and this is just born out</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="6.12">of love I mean I really just want to see</text>
  <text start="58.469" dur="7.501">the bride of Messiah understand that in</text>
  <text start="62.609" dur="5.151">no way do the do the teachings of</text>
  <text start="65.97" dur="5.06">Messiah and Apostle Paul Kohner dicked</text>
  <text start="67.76" dur="5.679">and they&amp;#39;re all geared toward us</text>
  <text start="71.03" dur="4.96">pursuing that everlasting in very simple</text>
  <text start="73.439" dur="5.691">gospel which is simply just to hearken o</text>
  <text start="75.99" dur="5.55">and obey to just do what His Word says</text>
  <text start="79.13" dur="5.11">it&amp;#39;s so simple that even child can</text>
  <text start="81.54" dur="4.23">understand so I&amp;#39;m breaking this down</text>
  <text start="84.24" dur="3.51">into 17 parts because there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="85.77" dur="4.529">there&amp;#39;s a lot of tricky things when it</text>
  <text start="87.75" dur="5.49">comes to understanding what Apostle Paul</text>
  <text start="90.299" dur="5.371">is writing and saying and I just want to</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="8.25">make sure this is very very clear so</text>
  <text start="95.67" dur="8.54">this first part is called the three main</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="6.18">principles these are principles rooted</text>
  <text start="104.21" dur="6.07">in either massage teachings or what is</text>
  <text start="107.67" dur="5.43">said about Paul&amp;#39;s writings that must be</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="6.03">kept in mind as we go through this</text>
  <text start="113.1" dur="6.57">series and as you personally read the</text>
  <text start="116.31" dur="6.18">letters of Apostle Paul the first</text>
  <text start="119.67" dur="8.96">principle can be found in Matthew</text>
  <text start="122.49" dur="10.86">chapter 5 verses 17 through 20</text>
  <text start="128.63" dur="6.85">sermon on the mount and it says this is</text>
  <text start="133.35" dur="5.28">Joshua of course speaking the Messiah</text>
  <text start="135.48" dur="6.24">and he says think not that I come to</text>
  <text start="138.63" dur="6.48">destroy the Torah or the prophets I come</text>
  <text start="141.72" dur="6.9">not to destroy but to fulfill that word</text>
  <text start="145.11" dur="10.05">fulfill means literally to revive to</text>
  <text start="148.62" dur="8.46">fill up to show how to properly obey so</text>
  <text start="155.16" dur="3.84">remember in that statement is rooted a</text>
  <text start="157.08" dur="5.7">lot of things the Pharisees and</text>
  <text start="159" dur="7.41">Sadducees they had forgotten many of the</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="8.37">main hearts of Torah mercy judgment</text>
  <text start="166.41" dur="7.049">faith love these things and now Yahshua</text>
  <text start="171.15" dur="3.99">Jesus had come to show us how to</text>
  <text start="173.459" dur="4.141">properly obey the tour through a heart</text>
  <text start="175.14" dur="6.63">of love which is what you always what</text>
  <text start="177.6" dur="7.29">the intention was for verily sandy you</text>
  <text start="181.77" dur="6.89">until the heavens and earth pass one jot</text>
  <text start="184.89" dur="8.159">or one tittle shall in no wise pass from</text>
  <text start="188.66" dur="7.63">the Torah so all be fulfilled and</text>
  <text start="193.049" dur="6.241">accomplished now we look at this</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="4.83">statement and again it&amp;#39;s not that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="4.38">being complicated me very very simple</text>
  <text start="201.12" dur="4.11">and straightforward I still see the</text>
  <text start="203.67" dur="4.379">heavens above me I still see the earth</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="5.22">beneath me right we all see that and and</text>
  <text start="208.049" dur="6.601">Messiah said as long as these things are</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="7.2">still here every jot every tittle of the</text>
  <text start="214.65" dur="4.649">Torah is still in place now there will</text>
  <text start="217.65" dur="5.01">come a time when the heavens and earth</text>
  <text start="219.299" dur="7.891">will pass away that will come and then</text>
  <text start="222.66" dur="7.109">you will definitely see certain parts of</text>
  <text start="227.19" dur="8.57">Torah pass away and that&amp;#39;s but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="229.769" dur="8.851">still in the future verses 19 wherefore</text>
  <text start="235.76" dur="5.74">tsutsumi whosoever therefore shall break</text>
  <text start="238.62" dur="6.3">one of these least Commandments in the</text>
  <text start="241.5" dur="5.19">Torah and shall teach men so he shall be</text>
  <text start="244.92" dur="6.569">called least in the kingdom of heaven</text>
  <text start="246.69" dur="6.359">but whosoever shall do and teach even</text>
  <text start="251.489" dur="3.331">the least Commandments even the smallest</text>
  <text start="253.049" dur="5.791">Commandments and tour the same shall be</text>
  <text start="254.82" dur="7.06">called great in the kingdom of heaven</text>
  <text start="258.84" dur="4.48">do you want to be known as least by your</text>
  <text start="261.88" dur="4.11">master or do you want to be known as</text>
  <text start="263.32" dur="4.94">great by your master we want to please</text>
  <text start="265.99" dur="4.8">yeah sure right that&amp;#39;s our whole coal</text>
  <text start="268.26" dur="3.82">for I saying to you that accept your</text>
  <text start="270.79" dur="2.67">righteousness shall exceed the</text>
  <text start="272.08" dur="3.93">righteousness of the scribes and</text>
  <text start="273.46" dur="5.82">Pharisees you shall in no case enter</text>
  <text start="276.01" dur="4.8">into the kingdom of heaven so again the</text>
  <text start="279.28" dur="4.17">scribes and Pharisees in many ways we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.81" dur="4.26">keeping a lot of the smaller or what we</text>
  <text start="283.45" dur="3.42">call the least commandments of Torah but</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="3.15">they were mixing it up with a lot of</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="3.72">their own vain traditions that were</text>
  <text start="288.22" dur="5.15">actually contradicting huge parts of</text>
  <text start="290.59" dur="5.07">Torah so we want to at least</text>
  <text start="293.37" dur="4.45">accomplished what the Pharisees did have</text>
  <text start="295.66" dur="4.59">but of course you want to go beyond that</text>
  <text start="297.82" dur="3.69">we want to have that love and the fruits</text>
  <text start="300.25" dur="4.5">of the spirit and think that they were</text>
  <text start="301.51" dur="7.17">lacking so this is the first principle</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="5.64">to remember in reading Apostle Paul</text>
  <text start="308.68" dur="3.96">letters that remember the same spirit of</text>
  <text start="310.39" dur="3.96">Yaba filled Yahshua also filled Apostle</text>
  <text start="312.64" dur="4.01">Paul so anything II rank is going to</text>
  <text start="314.35" dur="4.35">fall in line with the words of Messiah</text>
  <text start="316.65" dur="5.67">the second principle that goes along</text>
  <text start="318.7" dur="7.62">with this is found in Matthew 23 23</text>
  <text start="322.32" dur="7.24">where Yahshua is rebuking the Sadducees</text>
  <text start="326.32" dur="6.12">and Pharisees he says woe unto you</text>
  <text start="329.56" dur="5.82">scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="5.58">pay tithe of mint and anis and cumin and</text>
  <text start="335.38" dur="6.54">have omitted the weightier matters of</text>
  <text start="338.02" dur="6.42">the Torah judgment mercy and faith these</text>
  <text start="341.92" dur="6.33">aren&amp;#39;t you to have done and not leave</text>
  <text start="344.44" dur="5.52">the other undone you see that he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="348.25" dur="3.72">criticizing the tightening he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="349.96" dur="4.23">criticizing wearing the ZZ he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="351.97" dur="3.27">criticizing circumcision or these what</text>
  <text start="354.19" dur="2.55">we would call may be the least</text>
  <text start="355.24" dur="3.03">commandments and he not criticizing</text>
  <text start="356.74" dur="4.1">those things what he&amp;#39;s telling the first</text>
  <text start="358.27" dur="6.93">is that is you left out the big parts</text>
  <text start="360.84" dur="6.67">the face the mercy the judgment and then</text>
  <text start="365.2" dur="4.14">he very clearly said I would have you</text>
  <text start="367.51" dur="5.31">have done these things and not leave the</text>
  <text start="369.34" dur="7.44">other things undone so he wants he wants</text>
  <text start="372.82" dur="6.81">all or as much as possible to be done in</text>
  <text start="376.78" dur="8.62">like in our culture</text>
  <text start="379.63" dur="9.43">that should be our hearts so simple he</text>
  <text start="385.4" dur="4.98">wants all to be done but the problem in</text>
  <text start="389.06" dur="4.85">the first century was they were leaving</text>
  <text start="390.38" dur="6.18">out these main pillars of Torah that</text>
  <text start="393.91" dur="6.97">really goes along with Matthew 5 17</text>
  <text start="396.56" dur="5.76">through 20 as well Matthew 5 17 to 20 so</text>
  <text start="400.88" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s the principle number to Matthew</text>
  <text start="402.32" dur="5.79">23 23 and then the third principle to</text>
  <text start="405.8" dur="5.16">keep in mind especially as we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="408.11" dur="8.75">through Apostle Paul&amp;#39;s letters can be</text>
  <text start="410.96" dur="8.94">found in second Peter chapter 3 verse 16</text>
  <text start="416.86" dur="5.95">repito Peter he&amp;#39;s commenting about all</text>
  <text start="419.9" dur="5.22">of Paul&amp;#39;s letters and he says as also in</text>
  <text start="422.81" dur="4.859">all of Paul&amp;#39;s epistles speaking in them</text>
  <text start="425.12" dur="6.269">of these things and what some things are</text>
  <text start="427.669" dur="5.761">hard to be understood which they that</text>
  <text start="431.389" dur="4.351">are unlearned and unstable wrest as they</text>
  <text start="433.43" dur="7.23">do also the other scriptures unto their</text>
  <text start="435.74" dur="7.35">own destruction so Peter says they look</text>
  <text start="440.66" dur="5.97">good I mean I&amp;#39;m a pulse Paul writes some</text>
  <text start="443.09" dur="6.259">very long sentences so sometimes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.63" dur="6.96">easy to take things out of context and</text>
  <text start="449.349" dur="6.641">he was a very very intelligent guy very</text>
  <text start="453.59" dur="5.639">a master of Torah he came from a very</text>
  <text start="455.99" dur="4.98">learned background yet once he was</text>
  <text start="459.229" dur="3.81">converted he had a heart just burning</text>
  <text start="460.97" dur="4.47">for Messiah so in love with Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="463.039" dur="4.651">yet Peter says look be careful you</text>
  <text start="465.44" dur="4.89">really gotta be careful because those</text>
  <text start="467.69" dur="4.53">who are unstable those who don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="470.33" dur="4.83">what they&amp;#39;re doing who are unlearned</text>
  <text start="472.22" dur="5.61">they will twist what Paul saying under</text>
  <text start="475.16" dur="4.5">their own destruction so those those</text>
  <text start="477.83" dur="4.86">three principles are very important to</text>
  <text start="479.66" dur="5.91">keep in mind as we&amp;#39;re going forward as</text>
  <text start="482.69" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re reading these scriptures there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.57" dur="7.29">something else that just came into my</text>
  <text start="487.52" dur="7.05">mind too and this is sort of I guess an</text>
  <text start="492.86" dur="3.809">addition that I want to put into this</text>
  <text start="494.57" dur="5.969">thing and and that is there is this myth</text>
  <text start="496.669" dur="6.241">that somehow it&amp;#39;s impossible to obey</text>
  <text start="500.539" dur="5.331">keep the commandments to do the things</text>
  <text start="502.91" dur="5.72">that that yah has laid out in this word</text>
  <text start="505.87" dur="6.42">and I just want to read out in Luke</text>
  <text start="508.63" dur="9.18">chapter 1 verse 6 where it talks about</text>
  <text start="512.29" dur="8.31">John&amp;#39;s John the Baptist parents I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="517.81" dur="4.14">start with verse 5 does there was in the</text>
  <text start="520.6" dur="3.84">days of Herod the king of Judah a</text>
  <text start="521.95" dur="4.26">certain priest named Zechariah of the</text>
  <text start="524.44" dur="3.66">course of abaya and his wife was the</text>
  <text start="526.21" dur="4.05">daughter of Erin and her name was</text>
  <text start="528.1" dur="4.02">Elizabeth and they were both righteous</text>
  <text start="530.26" dur="4.32">before yah walking in all the</text>
  <text start="532.12" dur="6.96">commandments and ordinances of yahweh</text>
  <text start="534.58" dur="8.07">and blameless so when we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="539.08" dur="6.21">about his word his Commandments its</text>
  <text start="542.65" dur="4.98">scriptures they are not impossible to</text>
  <text start="545.29" dur="3.96">obey at all and we got a clear proof</text>
  <text start="547.63" dur="4.47">here right here in the in the New</text>
  <text start="549.25" dur="4.92">Testament so keep that in mind</text>
  <text start="552.1" dur="4.53">especially as we because again the whole</text>
  <text start="554.17" dur="4.26">the whole issue is we&amp;#39;re in this first</text>
  <text start="556.63" dur="4.83">century that the Pharisees and Sadducees</text>
  <text start="558.43" dur="5.97">were putting in all these does yoke that</text>
  <text start="561.46" dur="5.88">Peter talks about is burdensome stuff</text>
  <text start="564.4" dur="5.13">that was completely man-made oftentimes</text>
  <text start="567.34" dur="3.57">would contradict what the word of you i</text>
  <text start="569.53" dur="3.48">would say what the commandments would</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="4.89">say and truly was a burden it was a</text>
  <text start="573.01" dur="4.59">mechanism of control that they would use</text>
  <text start="575.8" dur="4.02">on the people and not even they could</text>
  <text start="577.6" dur="4.35">keep these all these little things that</text>
  <text start="579.82" dur="4.8">they had invented so keep that in mind</text>
  <text start="581.95" dur="4.38">as well alright so this is part one the</text>
  <text start="584.62" dur="3.9">three main principles to keep in mind</text>
  <text start="586.33" dur="5.31">and also the fact that they can obey his</text>
  <text start="588.52" dur="4.47">word and hopefully this you can refer</text>
  <text start="591.64" dur="4.32">back to this video as we&amp;#39;re going</text>
