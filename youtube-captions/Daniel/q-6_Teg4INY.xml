  <text start="169.75" dur="6.75">hike but in lieu of that this is the</text>
  <text start="172.54" dur="7.02">Sabbath Drive so anyway I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="176.5" dur="6.209">give those praise reports and just from</text>
  <text start="179.56" dur="5.399">mine began to everyone about how you</text>
  <text start="182.709" dur="4.141">know oh I know what I wanted to say as</text>
  <text start="184.959" dur="4.141">well and this has just come to me when I</text>
  <text start="186.85" dur="3.57">was driving to pick up Jeff so I you</text>
  <text start="189.1" dur="3.57">know I plugged in the address in my GPS</text>
  <text start="190.42" dur="6.05">to leave my air baby and go pick up Jeff</text>
  <text start="192.67" dur="6.81">he was down in Washington DC and you</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="5.17">know when you see those GPS directions</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s one thing but when you actually</text>
  <text start="201.64" dur="3.87">experience it because especially the</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="3.509">roads here and in and around DC are very</text>
  <text start="205.51" dur="3.15">windy and twisty and there&amp;#39;s all these</text>
  <text start="206.799" dur="3.811">turn offs and stuff that&amp;#39;s another thing</text>
  <text start="208.66" dur="2.79">and and as I was thinking about that was</text>
  <text start="210.61" dur="3.3">like that&amp;#39;s sort of the difference</text>
  <text start="211.45" dur="4.17">between you know when you just read the</text>
  <text start="213.91" dur="3.15">Bible without Boley spirit that&amp;#39;s sort</text>
  <text start="215.62" dur="4.17">of like just having that GPS coordinates</text>
  <text start="217.06" dur="4.59">you know you have the what&amp;#39;s there but</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="3.33">when you actually experience it and you</text>
  <text start="221.65" dur="3.39">realize where you need to go that&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="223.12" dur="4.71">reading the scriptures with the filling</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="4.77">of the Ruach Hakodesh the Holy Spirit so</text>
  <text start="227.83" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s so important that you&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="229.81" dur="3.78">in totally surrendered to Messiah get</text>
  <text start="231.58" dur="3.48">filled with the Holy Spirit so that when</text>
  <text start="233.59" dur="3.6">you aren&amp;#39;t reading the word reading the</text>
  <text start="235.06" dur="4.47">scriptures that comes alive to you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.19" dur="3.24">not just enough to have those GPS</text>
  <text start="239.53" dur="3.87">coordinates it&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="240.43" dur="4.02">experience where how things are and how</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="3.119">things look so you know where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.45" dur="5.129">going in the right way so anyway I just</text>
  <text start="246.519" dur="4.411">thought about analogy and also just the</text>
  <text start="249.579" dur="4.351">other encouragement which is don&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="5.339">ruled by fear anxious fear but be ruled</text>
  <text start="253.93" dur="4.83">by love which is has a different type of</text>
  <text start="256.269" dur="4.081">fear a holy fear where we have a all the</text>
  <text start="258.76" dur="4.56">reverence for God that&amp;#39;s always rooted</text>
  <text start="260.35" dur="5.37">in love being rooted in love will help</text>
  <text start="263.32" dur="4.01">you being rooted in Messiah Yahshua&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="265.72" dur="4.919">love will help you and everything you do</text>
