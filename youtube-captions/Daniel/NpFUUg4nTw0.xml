  <text start="0.5" dur="4.74">shabbat shalom this is daniel john lee</text>
  <text start="2.97" dur="6.48">with toro restoration ministries it is</text>
  <text start="5.24" dur="6.479">June the 27th 2015 Sabbath day were in</text>
  <text start="9.45" dur="7.669">the early days of the four fibra month</text>
  <text start="11.719" dur="8.801">summer begins I wanted to make a video</text>
  <text start="17.119" dur="6.131">about sort of a revised prophetic</text>
  <text start="20.52" dur="4.44">timelines and Daniel revelation as some</text>
  <text start="23.25" dur="3.599">of you may know if you&amp;#39;ve gone to my</text>
  <text start="24.96" dur="3.93">website at spirit or calm or if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="26.849" dur="4.92">followed my ministry for the last few</text>
  <text start="28.89" dur="7.849">years I was convinced that Yahshua was</text>
  <text start="31.769" dur="8.22">going to return in the year 2017 ad</text>
  <text start="36.739" dur="5.021">because that by all accounts and</text>
  <text start="39.989" dur="3.75">measures appears to be the next Jubilee</text>
  <text start="41.76" dur="4.139">year if you go to the tour of course</text>
  <text start="43.739" dur="4.261">Jubilee happens every 50 years it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="45.899" dur="6.18">year of liberty and release the last</text>
  <text start="48" dur="7.41">Jubilee being 1967 when the Jews retook</text>
  <text start="52.079" dur="4.62">Jerusalem so I was convinced 2017 being</text>
  <text start="55.41" dur="3.899">the next Jubilee would be the year</text>
  <text start="56.699" dur="5.371">Yahshua would return of course now here</text>
  <text start="59.309" dur="5.31">in the summer of 2015 obviously I was</text>
  <text start="62.07" dur="4.44">wrong because we all know that if you</text>
  <text start="64.619" dur="3.871">read the scriptures there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="66.51" dur="3.87">three-and-a-half-year Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="68.49" dur="4.35">that occurs leading up to the return of</text>
  <text start="70.38" dur="4.98">Messiah so if Yashiro was in fact going</text>
  <text start="72.84" dur="4.56">to return in the fall of 2017 as I</text>
  <text start="75.36" dur="5.46">thought then the Great Tribulation would</text>
  <text start="77.4" dur="6.539">begin in the spring of 2014 which of</text>
  <text start="80.82" dur="6.72">course did not happen so I want to offer</text>
  <text start="83.939" dur="5.82">up an alternative and you know this is</text>
  <text start="87.54" dur="5.039">not a vest saith yah it&amp;#39;s not you know</text>
  <text start="89.759" dur="4.47">I&amp;#39;m not saying this is you know</text>
  <text start="92.579" dur="3.9">revelation from heaven but it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="94.229" dur="3.991">meditations that I&amp;#39;ve been going over in</text>
  <text start="96.479" dur="4.261">my head has been reading Scripture and</text>
  <text start="98.22" dur="5.399">praying and just kind of thinking about</text>
  <text start="100.74" dur="4.14">where I got it wrong and maybe how I can</text>
  <text start="103.619" dur="4.561">still make sense of all this because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="104.88" dur="5.64">still convinced that 2017 is the next</text>
  <text start="108.18" dur="6.27">Jubilee I&amp;#39;m also still convinced at the</text>
  <text start="110.52" dur="6.57">year 17 ad was the year that Yahshua was</text>
  <text start="114.45" dur="4.11">crucified and resurrected I have a lot</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="2.91">of articles about this on my website I</text>
  <text start="118.56" dur="4.08">don&amp;#39;t want to go into too much about</text>
  <text start="120" dur="6.36">that now but just to make a long story</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="5.31">short in the year 1780 is the only</text>
  <text start="126.36" dur="3.09">a recorded major earthquake that</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="3.57">happened in the Middle East and it was</text>
  <text start="129.45" dur="4.32">so powerful that it over through several</text>
  <text start="131.52" dur="3.93">cities including Sardis up an Asia Minor</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="5.76">of course there was a major earthquake</text>
  <text start="135.45" dur="6.92">when Yahshua died on the cross so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="139.53" dur="5.88">convinced that 17 ad was a jubilee and</text>
  <text start="142.37" dur="5.35">and was the year that Yahshua died and</text>
  <text start="145.41" dur="6.51">rose again and we have historical data</text>
  <text start="147.72" dur="5.58">to back that up so let&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="151.92" dur="4.289">backtrack here now I know it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="153.3" dur="4.59">popular in the Messianic movement Hebrew</text>
  <text start="156.209" dur="3.721">roots movement especially with those who</text>
  <text start="157.89" dur="3.12">might follow Michael route to say that</text>
  <text start="159.93" dur="2.67">Yahshua did not have a</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="7.32">three-and-a-half-year ministry but he</text>
  <text start="162.6" dur="7.77">actually had a 70 week ministry but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="168.33" dur="4.2">gonna throw something out here let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="5.51">just for a minute that Michael Rood is</text>
  <text start="172.53" dur="7.49">wrong and Yahshua did have a</text>
  <text start="175.88" dur="7.06">three-and-a-half-year ministry okay so</text>
  <text start="180.02" dur="5.89">we know that there are 70 weeks in the</text>
  <text start="182.94" dur="4.86">Book of Daniel 69 of those weeks have</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="3.84">been fulfilled we can go back in history</text>
  <text start="187.8" dur="4.82">we can find out where those six to nine</text>
  <text start="189.75" dur="6.75">weeks of years were fulfilled between</text>
  <text start="192.62" dur="5.619">the edict the decree issued to rebuild</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="4.11">the temple all the way until Joshua was</text>
  <text start="198.239" dur="4.801">cut off and crucified two thousand years</text>
  <text start="200.61" dur="4.56">ago but there&amp;#39;s that last final week</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s 70th week of Daniel which would</text>
  <text start="205.17" dur="4.95">be a period of seven years that has not</text>
  <text start="207.33" dur="6.48">yet been fulfilled so my hypothesis is</text>
  <text start="210.12" dur="7.29">what if the final week the final seven</text>
  <text start="213.81" dur="6.42">years was split down the middle by a gap</text>
  <text start="217.41" dur="6.23">of two thousand years or 40 Jubilees and</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="5.4">I&amp;#39;m just going to try to I&amp;#39;m holding my</text>
  <text start="223.64" dur="6.569">iPad in one hand so I&amp;#39;m going to try to</text>
  <text start="225.63" dur="4.579">make a visual of this so</text>
  <text start="234.1" dur="12.59">so here let&amp;#39;s say this little mark here</text>
  <text start="237.52" dur="9.17">is the year 14 okay 14 ad</text>
  <text start="247.77" dur="7.92">and and Yahshua started his ministry in</text>
  <text start="251.01" dur="7.47">the fall of fourteen eighty and he was</text>
  <text start="255.69" dur="8.19">crucified and rose again in the spring</text>
  <text start="258.48" dur="11.25">of 1780 and this is when the earthquake</text>
  <text start="263.88" dur="9.6">is recorded historically and that would</text>
  <text start="269.73" dur="6.21">have been a jubilee a jubilee year that</text>
  <text start="273.48" dur="9.12">happens every 50 years according to the</text>
  <text start="275.94" dur="9.35">Torah then so that this period here of</text>
  <text start="282.6" dur="6.21">course is three and a half years right</text>
  <text start="285.29" dur="5.83">then we still have another three and a</text>
  <text start="288.81" dur="5.22">half years to finish out Daniels final</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="5.34">week seventh week but of course what</text>
  <text start="294.03" dur="9.21">happens now is we have a two thousand</text>
  <text start="296.46" dur="9.29">year gap two thousand years or 40</text>
  <text start="303.24" dur="2.51">Jubilees</text>
  <text start="308.18" dur="4.59">ok</text>
  <text start="309.65" dur="6.26">and so then we pick it up again right</text>
  <text start="312.77" dur="9.709">where the 70th week left off in the year</text>
  <text start="315.91" dur="9.569">2017 ad which also happens to be a</text>
  <text start="322.479" dur="3">jubilee</text>
  <text start="326.77" dur="9.17">now we start in the spring of 2017 80</text>
  <text start="330.009" dur="5.931">and go all the way to the fall of 2020</text>
  <text start="339.169" dur="5.511">and this would be the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="342.02" dur="2.66">right here</text>
  <text start="349.58" dur="7.89">okay and so here in 2020 the fall 2020</text>
  <text start="354.22" dur="5.289">yom teruah or Yom Kippur of twenty20</text>
  <text start="357.47" dur="5.599">somewhere in the fall piece Messiah</text>
  <text start="359.509" dur="3.56">returns the real Messiah</text>
  <text start="370.699" dur="6.01">so it&amp;#39;s kind of cool here because if</text>
  <text start="373.679" dur="5.79">this is correct we have a a mirror image</text>
  <text start="376.709" dur="6.96">that&amp;#39;s embedded in the final week of</text>
  <text start="379.469" dur="8.07">Daniel 70 weeks so we have three and a</text>
  <text start="383.669" dur="6.18">half years ends on a Jubilee 2000 year</text>
  <text start="387.539" dur="4.56">gap and then the last three and a half</text>
  <text start="389.849" dur="5.73">years of the great tribulation begins on</text>
  <text start="392.099" dur="6.36">a Jubilee remember the Bible says that</text>
  <text start="395.579" dur="5.16">if it were possible even the very elect</text>
  <text start="398.459" dur="3.75">would be deceived so I think it would</text>
  <text start="400.739" dur="4.1">really play into the deception if you</text>
  <text start="402.209" dur="5.4">had the false messiah the Antichrist</text>
  <text start="404.839" dur="5.38">emerged in the spring of 2017 because</text>
  <text start="407.609" dur="4.14">that is a Jubilee you would expect the</text>
  <text start="410.219" dur="3.9">real Messiah to come forth in the</text>
  <text start="411.749" dur="5.16">Jubilee but instead we have the false</text>
  <text start="414.119" dur="4.74">messiah and he emerges and so that would</text>
  <text start="416.909" dur="3.96">play into the deception now it will</text>
  <text start="418.859" dur="4.08">still be a Jubilee for the pure in heart</text>
  <text start="420.869" dur="5.85">because if you remember in Revelation</text>
  <text start="422.939" dur="6.48">chapter 12 the woman the pure-hearted</text>
  <text start="426.719" dur="4.26">believers are given wings of an eagle</text>
  <text start="429.419" dur="3.81">and they flee to the wilderness where</text>
  <text start="430.979" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re kept safe for three and a half</text>
  <text start="433.229" dur="4.74">years so that would start here and the</text>
  <text start="436.799" dur="2.4">woman would flee into the wilderness for</text>
  <text start="437.969" dur="3.12">the next three and a half years where</text>
  <text start="439.199" dur="3.661">she&amp;#39;ll be protected and nourished by yah</text>
  <text start="441.089" dur="4.92">so for them it really will be a</text>
  <text start="442.86" dur="5.039">wonderful Jubilee it&amp;#39;ll be finally</text>
  <text start="446.009" dur="4.65">leaving the Society of Babylon and and</text>
  <text start="447.899" dur="4.5">going into the wilderness so it will be</text>
  <text start="450.659" dur="4.23">a Jubilee and the Jubilee is for the</text>
  <text start="452.399" dur="4.5">Saints anyway so the Jubilee would be</text>
  <text start="454.889" dur="3.78">for that woman of course for everyone</text>
  <text start="456.899" dur="4.35">else they&amp;#39;re either going to be deceived</text>
  <text start="458.669" dur="4.95">and follow the false messiah or they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="461.249" dur="4.35">be beheaded and murdered over the next</text>
  <text start="463.619" dur="3.6">three and a half years the deceived to</text>
  <text start="465.599" dur="3.93">take the mark of the beast and follow</text>
  <text start="467.219" dur="4.47">the false messiah they&amp;#39;re going to think</text>
  <text start="469.529" dur="4.8">that the 1000 year millennial reign</text>
  <text start="471.689" dur="5.21">begins here now why would they think</text>
  <text start="474.329" dur="6.92">that well right now we&amp;#39;re in the year</text>
  <text start="476.899" dur="4.35">2015 in the summer and</text>
  <text start="482.849" dur="3.9">if you watch some videos by jonathan</text>
  <text start="484.77" dur="3.81">cahn if you look at some of the major</text>
  <text start="486.749" dur="4.41">economists lot of people are predicting</text>
  <text start="488.58" dur="4.16">that this fall particularly in September</text>
  <text start="491.159" dur="4.74">of 2015 we&amp;#39;re going to see a major</text>
  <text start="492.74" dur="5.199">financial meltdown just as we did seven</text>
  <text start="495.899" dur="3.871">years ago in the fall of two thousand</text>
  <text start="497.939" dur="3.331">eight and then of course seven years</text>
  <text start="499.77" dur="5.97">before that we had a major stock market</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="6.179">collapse days after September 11 2001 so</text>
  <text start="505.74" dur="4.699">there&amp;#39;s been this every seven-year</text>
  <text start="507.449" dur="5.431">pattern which is coming up this fall so</text>
  <text start="510.439" dur="4.78">what seems to be the case is that if</text>
  <text start="512.88" dur="5.31">there is a major financial meltdown this</text>
  <text start="515.219" dur="7.92">September you could have a lot of chaos</text>
  <text start="518.19" dur="8.459">for the following 18 months between 2015</text>
  <text start="523.139" dur="6.961">and the spring of 2017 and it will feel</text>
  <text start="526.649" dur="6.711">like Armageddon because you&amp;#39;ll have this</text>
  <text start="530.1" dur="6.27">major global financial meltdown wars</text>
  <text start="533.36" dur="5.32">chaos maybe even the fall of the United</text>
  <text start="536.37" dur="3.899">States a lot of chaos and so people will</text>
  <text start="538.68" dur="3.45">feel like it&amp;#39;s the Great Tribulation but</text>
  <text start="540.269" dur="4.981">it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s just a false Armageddon</text>
  <text start="542.13" dur="7.129">it&amp;#39;s just a decoy well most people who</text>
  <text start="545.25" dur="6.75">have a rudimentary knowledge of of</text>
  <text start="549.259" dur="4.901">Scripture and a prophecy think whoa Kate</text>
  <text start="552" dur="3.689">there&amp;#39;s the Great Tribulation and then</text>
  <text start="554.16" dur="2.97">after that you have the Messiah so if</text>
  <text start="555.689" dur="3.481">people feel like they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="557.13" dur="4.649">tribulation a great tribulation here in</text>
  <text start="559.17" dur="4.26">this period then by the time that we</text>
  <text start="561.779" dur="4.021">come to the spring of 2017 they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="563.43" dur="3.48">to be waiting for the Messiah and of</text>
  <text start="565.8" dur="4.409">course that&amp;#39;s when the false messiah</text>
  <text start="566.91" dur="5.549">comes so there&amp;#39;s that big deception so I</text>
  <text start="570.209" dur="5.011">think the 18 months between September</text>
  <text start="572.459" dur="5.49">2015 and the spring 2017 could be a</text>
  <text start="575.22" dur="4.679">false a false Great Tribulation which</text>
  <text start="577.949" dur="3.781">would make people believe that we had</text>
  <text start="579.899" dur="5.13">entered the millennion here when in fact</text>
  <text start="581.73" dur="5.33">it won&amp;#39;t begin until here so these are</text>
  <text start="585.029" dur="5.43">just some musings that I&amp;#39;ve been having</text>
  <text start="587.06" dur="5.67">take it or leave it but anyway I guess</text>
  <text start="590.459" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;ll find out soon if this is true</text>
