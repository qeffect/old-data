  <text start="2.399" dur="4.291">to our restoration ministries it is day</text>
  <text start="4.35" dur="4.38">five of Sukkot almost day six of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="6.69" dur="4.02">and I just wanted to kind of show people</text>
  <text start="8.73" dur="3.81">where I&amp;#39;m staying here because it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="10.71" dur="5.099">neat it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s basically literally a</text>
  <text start="12.54" dur="5.55">tree house there&amp;#39;s even a tree in the</text>
  <text start="15.809" dur="4.651">middle of the house that I&amp;#39;m staying in</text>
  <text start="18.09" dur="4.109">and it&amp;#39;s like a little suka you know the</text>
  <text start="20.46" dur="4.77">scripture talks about how we&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="22.199" dur="6.66">to dwell in sukas or temporary dwelling</text>
  <text start="25.23" dur="6.57">places or shelters for seven days in the</text>
  <text start="28.859" dur="6.181">eighth day is a huge celebration and of</text>
  <text start="31.8" dur="5.31">course the reason we do this is well the</text>
  <text start="35.04" dur="5.64">first reason is to remind us of how our</text>
  <text start="37.11" dur="5.46">ancestors the children of Israel we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="40.68" dur="3.449">in booths when they left Egypt so this</text>
  <text start="42.57" dur="4.649">is a temporary dwelling place you know</text>
  <text start="44.129" dur="4.981">we&amp;#39;re looking for an internal city not</text>
  <text start="47.219" dur="4.351">made with hands but one that comes down</text>
  <text start="49.11" dur="4.35">from heaven from yah and as you can see</text>
  <text start="51.57" dur="5.73">that&amp;#39;s the that&amp;#39;s the house I&amp;#39;m staying</text>
  <text start="53.46" dur="5.239">in little treehouse there that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="57.3" dur="3.599">first reason but then more importantly</text>
  <text start="58.699" dur="3.821">it has to do with the Living Waters</text>
  <text start="60.899" dur="4.44">because they would do the water oblation</text>
  <text start="62.52" dur="5.4">during the feast of Sukkot and Yahshua</text>
  <text start="65.339" dur="5.581">if you go to John chapter 7 he talks</text>
  <text start="67.92" dur="5.1">about how he is the Living Waters and he</text>
  <text start="70.92" dur="6">proclaims us out on the last great day</text>
  <text start="73.02" dur="5.58">the eighth day of the feast the eighth</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="3.18">day feast it&amp;#39;s like the most joyous</text>
  <text start="78.6" dur="3.059">celebration of all the feasts I mean</text>
  <text start="80.1" dur="4.22">it&amp;#39;s better than Hanukkah better than</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="5.041">Purim better than Passover better than</text>
  <text start="84.32" dur="5.409">shavuot it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s better than trumpets</text>
  <text start="86.7" dur="5.129">it&amp;#39;s is the ultimate feast because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="3.591">the first seven days of dwelling in</text>
  <text start="91.829" dur="5.821">booths and tents is pointing toward</text>
  <text start="93.32" dur="7.06">Zakaria 14 a revelation 20 when Yahshua</text>
  <text start="97.65" dur="4.109">is ruling and reigning from Jerusalem we</text>
  <text start="100.38" dur="3.059">are resurrected ruling and reigning with</text>
  <text start="101.759" dur="3.631">him and all the nations of the earth are</text>
  <text start="103.439" dur="3.54">coming up to Jerusalem every year to</text>
  <text start="105.39" dur="3.33">keep the feast of Sukkot and those</text>
  <text start="106.979" dur="4.801">nations that do not they will receive no</text>
  <text start="108.72" dur="5.25">rain but then the eighth day the last</text>
  <text start="111.78" dur="5.25">day of sukkot is pointing toward even</text>
  <text start="113.97" dur="4.469">beyond that past the 1000 year reign</text>
  <text start="117.03" dur="4.589">past the great white throne judgment</text>
  <text start="118.439" dur="4.771">where Yom Kippur is fulfilled and you</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="3.481">get to the new heavens in newark and</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s what the last great days about</text>
  <text start="125.1" dur="3.12">well the eighth day it&amp;#39;s going to be the</text>
  <text start="126.54" dur="3.57">eighth millennium now I&amp;#39;m far enough</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="3.57">away that you can sort of see where I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="130.11" dur="2.77">staying so that&amp;#39;s my treehouse that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="131.79" dur="3.43">sukkah</text>
  <text start="132.88" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;ll be four day five and a six of</text>
  <text start="135.22" dur="5.82">the feast of Sukkot so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.37" dur="4.29">a wonderful place and again Yahshua you</text>
  <text start="141.04" dur="3.03">know he got him into this place because</text>
  <text start="142.66" dur="7.07">he wanted to show me some things about</text>
  <text start="144.07" dur="5.66">the Oregon Caves and kind of you know</text>
  <text start="149.79" dur="7.33">I&amp;#39;ve made three podcasts already where I</text>
  <text start="152.26" dur="6.3">sort of talked about you know what yalls</text>
  <text start="157.12" dur="3.69">beginning to show me but there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="158.56" dur="4.29">to be more because you know John speaks</text>
  <text start="160.81" dur="3.33">in many different ways of course he</text>
  <text start="162.85" dur="2.82">speaks through his work we need to be</text>
  <text start="164.14" dur="3.66">rooted in his word and I&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="4.74">that he speaks through his spirit the</text>
  <text start="167.8" dur="5.37">reason he gave the comforter on shab</text>
  <text start="170.41" dur="4.5">eloped Pentecost is he says I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="173.17" dur="5.07">send you the comforter to remind you of</text>
  <text start="174.91" dur="5.88">all things it&amp;#39;s very difficult in fact</text>
  <text start="178.24" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s impossible to understand the word</text>
  <text start="180.79" dur="5.67">the commandments the scripture without</text>
  <text start="183.31" dur="5.19">his spirit helping us otherwise it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.46" dur="5.16">just dry bones so we need both his word</text>
  <text start="188.5" dur="5.91">of the Torah and his commandments and a</text>
  <text start="191.62" dur="4.5">spirit and when I say Torah you know</text>
  <text start="194.41" dur="4.17">Torah is not just the first five books</text>
  <text start="196.12" dur="5.27">of the Bible it&amp;#39;s not just Genesis</text>
  <text start="198.58" dur="6.93">Exodus Leviticus numbers and Deuteronomy</text>
  <text start="201.39" dur="7.51">the Torah is Genesis to Revelation okay</text>
  <text start="205.51" dur="6.33">because in all 66 of those books contain</text>
  <text start="208.9" dur="7.11">instructions for life of course Yahshua</text>
  <text start="211.84" dur="9.59">the Messiah he&amp;#39;s the center of it all so</text>
  <text start="216.01" dur="8.16">we need that but this festival of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="6.01">it is the most joyous time of the year</text>
  <text start="224.17" dur="5.43">because it&amp;#39;s pointing toward the time</text>
  <text start="227.44" dur="6.78">when yah himself will tabernacle or</text>
  <text start="229.6" dur="9">Sukkot with men a time when sin has</text>
  <text start="234.22" dur="5.4">finally been removed from this earth but</text>
  <text start="238.6" dur="2.01">anyway I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of things</text>
  <text start="239.62" dur="3.24">that y&amp;#39;all still going to show me</text>
  <text start="240.61" dur="6.03">involving the caves involving the mount</text>
  <text start="242.86" dur="5.25">Elijah even involving this place I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="246.64" dur="3">been invited to a breakfast at nine</text>
  <text start="248.11" dur="3.78">o&amp;#39;clock tomorrow morning from the</text>
  <text start="249.64" dur="4.71">caretakers who who take care of this</text>
  <text start="251.89" dur="4.83">place and I&amp;#39;m fairly certain they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.35" dur="4.139">Christian so pray for that because I</text>
  <text start="256.72" dur="4.5">think it will be a time of testimony a</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="4.411">time of being able to share with them</text>
  <text start="261.22" dur="2.6">about what yalls been putting on my</text>
  <text start="262.9" dur="3.56">heart</text>
  <text start="263.82" dur="4.89">I&amp;#39;m now on a balcony that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="266.46" dur="4.83">outside the treehouse and as you can see</text>
  <text start="268.71" dur="4.89">the view I mean it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="271.29" dur="3.6">idyllic I&amp;#39;m basically in the middle of</text>
  <text start="273.6" dur="3.21">the mountains I don&amp;#39;t have any cell</text>
  <text start="274.89" dur="3.03">phone service I have internet but I</text>
  <text start="276.81" dur="3.54">don&amp;#39;t have cell phone service because</text>
  <text start="277.92" dur="5.61">I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m deep in the Oregon mountains of</text>
  <text start="280.35" dur="6.93">Southern Oregon so it&amp;#39;s perfect it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.53" dur="6.54">perfect for this festival anyway i also</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="6.48">just wanted to because yas really been</text>
  <text start="290.07" dur="4.83">laying this on my heart i don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="293.76" dur="2.46">this is just happening with tour</text>
  <text start="294.9" dur="3.18">restoration ministries i think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.22" dur="3.86">probably happening within the body of</text>
  <text start="298.08" dur="3.99">Messiah all over the world right now but</text>
  <text start="300.08" dur="4.54">basically I have to tell you guys that</text>
  <text start="302.07" dur="4.83">since the piece of trumpets there has</text>
  <text start="304.62" dur="4.77">been a fresh fire like a revival fire</text>
