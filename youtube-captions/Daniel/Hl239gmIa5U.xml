  <text start="538.64" dur="6.28">so this I just think this is very</text>
  <text start="543.09" dur="4.38">interesting because Pete seems to be</text>
  <text start="544.92" dur="4.71">suggesting that if the deep state tries</text>
  <text start="547.47" dur="4.38">to unleash its bioweapon they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="549.63" dur="5.19">to use something like what&amp;#39;s been going</text>
  <text start="551.85" dur="5.52">on in Congo and then blame it blame it</text>
  <text start="554.82" dur="4.11">on a foreign country so I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="557.37" dur="3.9">this is the way that they would try to</text>
  <text start="558.93" dur="6.27">get this type of virus in I&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="561.27" dur="6.75">about this before you know the wall is</text>
  <text start="565.2" dur="4.38">is about so much involving stopping</text>
  <text start="568.02" dur="3.96">human trafficking child sex trafficking</text>
  <text start="569.58" dur="3.57">but also we don&amp;#39;t want to allow people</text>
  <text start="571.98" dur="5.94">in that are just filled with these</text>
  <text start="573.15" dur="7.98">diseases right we don&amp;#39;t so in any case I</text>
  <text start="577.92" dur="5.91">wanted to just report on that this last</text>
  <text start="581.13" dur="3.75">story very interesting from the hill I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="583.83" dur="2.88">not gonna really read it because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.88" dur="4.5">very unflattering toward President Trump</text>
  <text start="586.71" dur="4.59">but if you read between the lines this</text>
  <text start="589.38" dur="4.38">article talks about Trump ditches his</text>
  <text start="591.3" dur="4.65">one-on-one meetings with Vice President</text>
  <text start="593.76" dur="4.17">Pence President Trump has largely</text>

  <text start="603.12" dur="5.07">to lunch meetings with vice president</text>
  <text start="604.98" dur="4.65">pence so I think it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="608.19" dur="3.21">that he&amp;#39;s no longer having these</text>
  <text start="609.63" dur="3.93">one-on-one meetings with his vice</text>

  <text start="616.5" dur="5.01">can watch my video Michael Flynn versus</text>
  <text start="619.2" dur="3.75">pence I think that Mike Pence had a</text>
