  <text start="28.619" dur="5.701">part series which is entitled first</text>
  <text start="31.199" dur="4.501">Corinthians 7 what does Paul mean by</text>
  <text start="34.32" dur="3.509">circumcision we&amp;#39;re going to get right</text>
  <text start="35.7" dur="4.14">into it because this passage has been</text>
  <text start="37.829" dur="3.66">used to tell people oh yeah the</text>
  <text start="39.84" dur="3.84">commandment the circumcision has passed</text>
  <text start="41.489" dur="5.881">away is that really what Paul saying</text>
  <text start="43.68" dur="5.19">well let&amp;#39;s look at this so the first</text>
  <text start="47.37" dur="4.05">part of this chapter is all about</text>
  <text start="48.87" dur="4.38">marriage and both Paul&amp;#39;s opinion about</text>
  <text start="51.42" dur="4.35">marriage and then Paul also them cites</text>
  <text start="53.25" dur="4.949">yacht&amp;#39;s Commandments about marriage but</text>
  <text start="55.77" dur="5.19">the the scripture about circumcision</text>
  <text start="58.199" dur="5.401">starts it will start in verse 17 to the</text>
  <text start="60.96" dur="5.49">verse before this he says but as yahoo</text>
  <text start="63.6" dur="5.1">distributed to every man as Yahweh has</text>
  <text start="66.45" dur="6.48">called everyone so let him walk and so I</text>
  <text start="68.7" dur="6.87">so ordain I in all the Assemblies is any</text>
  <text start="72.93" dur="5.52">man called being circumcised let him not</text>
  <text start="75.57" dur="4.799">become uncircumcised is any called an</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="4.41">uncircumcision let him not be</text>
  <text start="80.369" dur="4.29">circumcised circumcision is nothing and</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="3.81">uncircumcision is nothing but the</text>
  <text start="84.659" dur="5.011">commandment but but the keeping of the</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="5.25">commandments of yah let every man abide</text>
  <text start="89.67" dur="5.28">in the same calling wherein he was</text>
  <text start="91.92" dur="6.9">called okay so the first thing we need</text>
  <text start="94.95" dur="5.489">to do is so basically people will read</text>
  <text start="98.82" dur="2.939">this and say okay look see all things</text>
  <text start="100.439" dur="5.581">circumcision doesn&amp;#39;t matter we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="101.759" dur="6.15">need to do it it doesn&amp;#39;t matter okay the</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="4.919">first thing we need to understand is if</text>
  <text start="107.909" dur="5.221">you read the scripture literally it says</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="5.341">as any man called being circumcised let</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="5.4">him not become uncircumcised if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="4.11">literally talking about the circumcision</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="4.199">the commandment the yah gave to Abraham</text>
  <text start="120.39" dur="6.93">to remove the foreskin of a baby at</text>
  <text start="122.729" dur="7.321">eight days of age how can you become</text>
  <text start="127.32" dur="4.38">uncircumcised there&amp;#39;s no way to put the</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="4.23">foreskin back on you</text>
  <text start="131.7" dur="4.86">okay so right there we should have a</text>
  <text start="134.28" dur="3.14">clue that Paul&amp;#39;s talking about something</text>
  <text start="136.56" dur="5.67">else</text>
  <text start="137.42" dur="6.819">now if you&amp;#39;re saying look if you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="142.23" dur="3.089">believer and you&amp;#39;re uncircumcised you</text>
  <text start="144.239" dur="3.991">don&amp;#39;t need to worry about circumcision</text>
  <text start="145.319" dur="4.531">this that that understanding of the ship</text>
  <text start="148.23" dur="6.479">sure we&amp;#39;re completely contradicts what</text>
  <text start="149.85" dur="8.37">Paul did in Acts chapter 16 starting in</text>
  <text start="154.709" dur="7.651">verse 3 this is talking about Paul</text>
  <text start="158.22" dur="6.75">taking Timothy with him into Lystra and</text>
  <text start="162.36" dur="4.32">Iconium so the tenth would Paul have to</text>
  <text start="164.97" dur="4.2">go forth with him and took and</text>
  <text start="166.68" dur="4.11">circumcised Timothy because of the Jews</text>
  <text start="169.17" dur="4.05">which are in those quarters for they</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="6.12">knew all that his father was a Greek</text>
  <text start="173.22" dur="6.12">okay so Timothy had a mother who was a</text>
  <text start="176.91" dur="5.7">Jew and a father who was a Greek he was</text>
  <text start="179.34" dur="5.79">not circumcised he was uncircumcised and</text>
  <text start="182.61" dur="3.959">hey Paul says the first Corinthian say</text>
  <text start="185.13" dur="4.05">if you&amp;#39;re uncircumcised that&amp;#39;s how you</text>
  <text start="186.569" dur="4.23">should continue on right mmm well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.18" dur="4.08">not what Paul does here Paul actually</text>
  <text start="190.799" dur="4.201">has Timothy get circumcised as a</text>
  <text start="193.26" dur="5.52">testimony to the Jews so they can</text>
  <text start="195" dur="5.04">minister to them right so and again</text>
  <text start="198.78" dur="3.209">this was a commandment this was a</text>
  <text start="200.04" dur="3.539">commandment given to Abraham your</text>
  <text start="201.989" dur="3.511">parents were supposed to do it to you on</text>
  <text start="203.579" dur="3.391">the eighth day of your life and if they</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="3.48">fail to do something you need to make</text>
  <text start="206.97" dur="4.32">sure it gets done because this is the</text>
  <text start="208.98" dur="4.8">only way you can partake a Passover so</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="3.99">this is a commandment and Paul make sure</text>
  <text start="213.78" dur="4.53">that Timothy has this so that he can</text>
  <text start="215.28" dur="4.95">continue to Minister with Paul to these</text>
  <text start="218.31" dur="6.03">to these Jews and not have a stumbling</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="6.18">block there so what is Paul saying then</text>
  <text start="224.34" dur="5.34">what is Paul saying well the clue we</text>
  <text start="226.41" dur="6.51">have is in verse 20 it says let every</text>
  <text start="229.68" dur="8.04">man abide in the same calling wherein he</text>
  <text start="232.92" dur="6.93">was called so remember how Paul was</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="4.29">called primarily not exclusively but</text>
  <text start="239.85" dur="4.859">primarily to minister today of the</text>
  <text start="242.01" dur="5.819">uncircumcision to the Gentiles okay</text>
  <text start="244.709" dur="6.09">and Peter was primarily not exclusively</text>
  <text start="247.829" dur="5.341">but Peter was primarily called to</text>
  <text start="250.799" dur="5.49">minister today of the circumcision today</text>
  <text start="253.17" dur="4.95">of the Jews right so what Paul&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="256.289" dur="4.021">here and if you read the whole context</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="3.69">of the chapter saying look remain in the</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="4.47">calling that you&amp;#39;re in if you&amp;#39;re called</text>
  <text start="261.81" dur="5.67">to go in Minister today</text>
  <text start="264.78" dur="4.41">circumcision then do so if you&amp;#39;re called</text>
  <text start="267.48" dur="4.92">to minister today those of the</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="4.71">uncircumcision then then do the do so in</text>
  <text start="272.4" dur="4.11">other words remain the calling that</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;re in he goes on to say look if</text>
  <text start="276.51" dur="3.3">you&amp;#39;re a slave or if you&amp;#39;re a servant</text>
  <text start="278.22" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t worry about it that&amp;#39;s ok that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="2.85">fine remain in that calling your I was</text>
  <text start="281.52" dur="2.94">going to use you in other words you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="282.66" dur="3.36">going to use you where you&amp;#39;re at to</text>
  <text start="284.46" dur="3.72">minister to those who are around you</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s what this has to do has nothing</text>
  <text start="288.18" dur="5.7">to do with actually the commandment</text>
  <text start="291.45" dur="4.74">given to Abraham by Yahweh that is a</text>
  <text start="293.88" dur="4.71">commandment it wouldn&amp;#39;t even make sense</text>
  <text start="296.19" dur="4.86">if he was referring to the commandment</text>
  <text start="298.59" dur="4.8">because he says circumcision is nothing</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="4.22">and uncircumcision rushing nothing but</text>
  <text start="303.39" dur="6.72">the keeping of the commandments of yah</text>
  <text start="305.27" dur="7.83">ok so just replace that with any other</text>
  <text start="310.11" dur="5.34">commandment stealing is nothing and and</text>
  <text start="313.1" dur="3.58">not stealing is nothing but keep the</text>
  <text start="315.45" dur="1.82">commandments of yah well that wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="316.68" dur="5.22">make sense</text>
  <text start="317.27" dur="6.82">adultery is nothing and not committing</text>
  <text start="321.9" dur="3.42">adultery is nothing but the keeping it</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="2.36">commandments of yah oh that doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="325.32" dur="5.55">sense</text>
  <text start="326.45" dur="5.95">so Paul is talking about look it people</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="3.42">were getting so concerned about oh maybe</text>
  <text start="332.4" dur="3.12">I should change my calling here and go</text>
  <text start="334.29" dur="3.15">do this or maybe I should do that in</text>
  <text start="335.52" dur="3.77">pulsing no no no no stay where you&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="4.74">stay or yot explained to you and</text>
  <text start="339.29" dur="5.23">minister where you&amp;#39;re at and be used by</text>
  <text start="342.18" dur="3.06">Yahweh or at that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s referring</text>
  <text start="344.52" dur="2.76">to</text>
  <text start="345.24" dur="4.2">saying don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t try it because that</text>
  <text start="347.28" dur="4.11">was the big issue here that we had those</text>
  <text start="349.44" dur="3.42">of the circumcision and then you had</text>
  <text start="351.39" dur="4.47">those of the uncircumcision those are</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="4.74">these were the two groups that that Paul</text>
  <text start="355.86" dur="4.11">and Peter and the Apostles over they</text>
  <text start="357.6" dur="5.76">were trying to show need to be one in</text>
  <text start="359.97" dur="4.56">Messiah and so they were various people</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="3.6">were being called to minister to these</text>
  <text start="364.53" dur="5.16">two people groups and that&amp;#39;s what this</text>
  <text start="366.96" dur="5.22">is referring to has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="369.69" dur="4.44">the actual commandment given to Abraham</text>
  <text start="372.18" dur="3.69">and that&amp;#39;s very very very important to</text>
  <text start="374.13" dur="3.81">understand and that&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="375.87" dur="4.41">interpretation the only interpretation</text>
  <text start="377.94" dur="5.76">that would make sense of what Paul does</text>
  <text start="380.28" dur="5.13">with Timothy and that fits the context</text>
  <text start="383.7" dur="3.77">in verse 20 where it says let every man</text>
  <text start="385.41" dur="6.3">abide in the calling where he was called</text>
  <text start="387.47" dur="5.74">so I hope that clears this up I just</text>
  <text start="391.71" dur="3">wanted to touch on those two verses</text>
  <text start="393.21" dur="4.35">because again this is a</text>
  <text start="394.71" dur="4.65">a passage that Christians will use to</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="4.83">try to say I&amp;#39;ll look you know we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="399.36" dur="4.56">need to keep the Torah you know we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="402.39" dur="4.53">need to worry about it look we need to</text>
  <text start="403.92" dur="4.53">keep the Torah not because we have to</text>
  <text start="406.92" dur="4.02">but because we want to because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.45" dur="4.11">written inside us it&amp;#39;s written inside</text>
  <text start="410.94" dur="4.5">our hearts and so that means we have now</text>
  <text start="412.56" dur="5.7">an inward desire to do that which yah</text>
  <text start="415.44" dur="4.2">has laid down in his word and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="418.26" dur="3.81">just doing those things that are</text>
  <text start="419.64" dur="4.65">convenient or easy to do it&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="422.07" dur="4.41">those things that Yann says to do and</text>
  <text start="424.29" dur="4.35">then we conform our lives around that</text>
  <text start="426.48" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;m winning a testimony half of that is</text>
  <text start="428.64" dur="4.68">Shabbat when I was first introduced to</text>
  <text start="430.59" dur="5.9">Shabbat many years ago I was working I</text>
  <text start="433.32" dur="6.09">had to work to one Saturday a month and</text>
  <text start="436.49" dur="4.26">that was the biggest sales day at the</text>
  <text start="439.41" dur="4.08">place where I was working at the time</text>
  <text start="440.75" dur="4.3">and basically it was a requirement of</text>
  <text start="443.49" dur="4.92">the job and I started this you know</text>
  <text start="445.05" dur="5.04">before I had known about Shabbat and for</text>
  <text start="448.41" dur="3.51">about six or seven months after I</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="3.24">learned about Shabbat I was wrestling</text>
  <text start="451.92" dur="3.63">with this not sure what to do and</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="3.99">finally I went to my boss and I said you</text>
  <text start="455.55" dur="4.44">know what whether you fire me or not I</text>
  <text start="457.32" dur="4.32">can no longer come in one Saturday month</text>
  <text start="459.99" dur="4.77">because this is the Sabbath day this is</text>
  <text start="461.64" dur="4.83">the Shabbat and I need to do it and he</text>
  <text start="464.76" dur="4.07">said that&amp;#39;s fine Daniel that&amp;#39;s fine and</text>
  <text start="466.47" dur="4.59">he let he let me have that off they they</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="4.36">they changed the rules for me so I</text>
  <text start="471.06" dur="4.05">didn&amp;#39;t have to work anymore and my sales</text>
  <text start="473.19" dur="4.47">actually shot up because of that I was</text>
  <text start="475.11" dur="5.76">actually blessed because I was willing</text>
  <text start="477.66" dur="6.63">to change my life in order to fit yeah</text>
  <text start="480.87" dur="5.7">to fit into Yahweh&amp;#39;s Commandments into</text>
  <text start="484.29" dur="3.6">his ways and this is his words and</text>
  <text start="486.57" dur="3.24">that&amp;#39;s what we always need to be making</text>
  <text start="487.89" dur="4.41">sure that we do that we&amp;#39;re doing even</text>
  <text start="489.81" dur="4.77">those things which are inconvenient or</text>
  <text start="492.3" dur="5.4">maybe even scary to make sure that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="494.58" dur="4.83">walking in his ways all right I hope</text>
