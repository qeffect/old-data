  <text start="0.02" dur="5.77">okay greetings a happy first day of the</text>
  <text start="2.939" dur="4.32">week this is daniel here I&amp;#39;ve gotten</text>
  <text start="5.79" dur="5.67">several phone calls now that I&amp;#39;ve put my</text>
  <text start="7.259" dur="7.8">phone number up under my videos of the</text>
  <text start="11.46" dur="6.81">second one of voter fraud substantiated</text>
  <text start="15.059" dur="6.001">New Hampshire and from those calls I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="18.27" dur="4.679">gotten really some good ideas that we</text>
  <text start="21.06" dur="4.379">could do to help with the upcoming</text>
  <text start="22.949" dur="5.521">primary so this is primarily for any Ron</text>
  <text start="25.439" dur="6.18">Paul supporter that is planning to vote</text>
  <text start="28.47" dur="7.71">in the Michigan primary South Carolina</text>
  <text start="31.619" dur="6.03">primary or Nevada Nevada primary and of</text>
  <text start="36.18" dur="2.67">course I hope if you are Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="37.649" dur="2.671">supporter and you&amp;#39;re living in any of</text>
  <text start="38.85" dur="6.51">these two states you plan to be voting</text>
  <text start="40.32" dur="6.69">regardless but all those who are going</text>
  <text start="45.36" dur="3.929">I&amp;#39;m going to make a request of you</text>
  <text start="47.01" dur="4.56">number one if you have a cell phone with</text>
  <text start="49.289" dur="6.301">a with a camera on it or if you have</text>
  <text start="51.57" dur="6.21">some sort of camcorder you know mini</text>
  <text start="55.59" dur="4.35">camcorder or something if you could when</text>
  <text start="57.78" dur="5.22">you go to the polling place for your</text>
  <text start="59.94" dur="4.679">primary Michigan it&amp;#39;s this tuesday and</text>
  <text start="63" dur="3.65">then when you go to South Carolina and</text>
  <text start="64.619" dur="5.641">Nevada which i believe is this upcoming</text>
  <text start="66.65" dur="5.259">saturday if you can bring a camera or</text>
  <text start="70.26" dur="3.6">your cell phone and record yourself</text>
  <text start="71.909" dur="3.481">either now they may not allow you to</text>
  <text start="73.86" dur="2.82">bring it you know to film yourself as</text>
  <text start="75.39" dur="4.44">you actually go into the poll and vote</text>
  <text start="76.68" dur="5.34">but you could document yourself and</text>
  <text start="79.83" dur="3.66">record yourself on video as you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="82.02" dur="3.27">walking into the pole or as you come out</text>
  <text start="83.49" dur="4.23">to say I just voted for Ron Paul and</text>
  <text start="85.29" dur="5.25">then post it as a video response to this</text>
  <text start="87.72" dur="4.74">video I need as many people who hear</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="3.39">this video to help us get viral if you</text>
  <text start="92.46" dur="3.99">can get it to be posted on daily Paul</text>
  <text start="93.93" dur="4.439">com or Ron Paul 2008 to come I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="96.45" dur="3.36">really have time to get this out but if</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="5.07">people out there who have some time can</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="5.73">get this YouTube out there try to but</text>
  <text start="103.439" dur="4.771">but the idea is if you are living in</text>
  <text start="105.54" dur="4.859">Michigan South Carolina and Nevada and</text>
  <text start="108.21" dur="4.47">when you go to your caucus or primary</text>
  <text start="110.399" dur="3.601">whatever you&amp;#39;re having and as you go to</text>
  <text start="112.68" dur="3.42">vote for Ron Paul if you could document</text>
  <text start="114" dur="4.56">that with your video camera on your cell</text>
  <text start="116.1" dur="4.17">phone or camcorder and then post that is</text>
  <text start="118.56" dur="4.47">a video response here at YouTube to this</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="4.11">video that way we can have now I realize</text>
  <text start="123.03" dur="2.49">not everyone who&amp;#39;s going to go vote for</text>
  <text start="124.38" dur="2.669">Ron Paul is going to have a cell phone</text>
  <text start="125.52" dur="4.29">or have the ability to record themselves</text>
  <text start="127.049" dur="5.851">but at the very least we can have some</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="5.19">sort of idea of raw numbers of</text>
  <text start="132.9" dur="3.57">each County you know and and also when</text>
  <text start="135" dur="3.599">you post a video response post your</text>
  <text start="136.47" dur="5.7">county the the precinct that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="138.599" dur="5.191">voting in and you know maybe maybe the</text>
  <text start="142.17" dur="3.78">rough around the time that you voted</text>
  <text start="143.79" dur="3.63">that way we can compare the votes that</text>
  <text start="145.95" dur="4.97">are coming in precinct by precinct and</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="5.519">compare it to to the people that are</text>
  <text start="150.92" dur="4.539">voting so for example if we have a</text>
  <text start="152.939" dur="5.431">precinct in Michigan that says there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.459" dur="6.48">only 25 votes for Ron Paul but we have</text>
  <text start="158.37" dur="5.55">40 40 video responses of people who</text>
  <text start="161.939" dur="3.541">voted for Ron Paul in that precinct then</text>
  <text start="163.92" dur="4.17">we know that there&amp;#39;s something wrong and</text>
  <text start="165.48" dur="4.44">we have verifiable proof so that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="4.049">idea the other idea and this is actually</text>
  <text start="169.92" dur="3.959">an even better idea because it&amp;#39;ll help</text>
  <text start="172.139" dur="4.88">those of you who don&amp;#39;t have cell phones</text>
  <text start="173.879" dur="7.17">or means to record yourself with video</text>
  <text start="177.019" dur="5.711">if you could go ahead and and get a</text>
  <text start="181.049" dur="3.27">legal document an affidavit which is</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="4.589">pretty easy to get at your local County</text>
  <text start="184.319" dur="4.441">Courthouse I realized from Michigan you</text>
  <text start="187.319" dur="3.601">know you only have basically Monday to</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="3.96">do this because you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re voting day</text>
  <text start="190.92" dur="5.01">is Tuesday but if you can try to get an</text>
  <text start="192.72" dur="4.979">affidavit to get it signed when you go</text>
  <text start="195.93" dur="3.029">vote for Ron Paul say stating that you</text>
  <text start="197.699" dur="3.54">voted for Ron Paul and such of such a</text>
  <text start="198.959" dur="4.471">date that way that&amp;#39;s a legal document</text>
  <text start="201.239" dur="5.521">that you can that you that you will have</text>
  <text start="203.43" dur="5.85">and if we can get everyone to do that we</text>
  <text start="206.76" dur="4.83">can actually collect you know signed</text>
  <text start="209.28" dur="4.859">affidavits proving exactly how many</text>
  <text start="211.59" dur="4.019">people voted now I realize in the past</text>
  <text start="214.139" dur="2.791">you know America&amp;#39;s have been like well</text>
  <text start="215.609" dur="3.121">you know voting is a very private thing</text>
  <text start="216.93" dur="3.75">we don&amp;#39;t want to let anyone know but you</text>
  <text start="218.73" dur="4.229">know what if you&amp;#39;re for Ron Paul you</text>
  <text start="220.68" dur="4.29">know just be you should be bold about it</text>
  <text start="222.959" dur="3.96">anyway you shouldn&amp;#39;t be ashamed you know</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="3.15">get a signed affidavit or record</text>
  <text start="226.919" dur="3.391">yourself and post it as a video response</text>
  <text start="228.12" dur="3.229">if you get a signed affidavit we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="230.31" dur="3.419">going to have to figure out a way to</text>
  <text start="231.349" dur="4.39">collect all of these affidavits so we</text>
  <text start="233.729" dur="4.35">can actually count them which I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="235.739" dur="3.691">exactly sure how we can do that maybe if</text>
  <text start="238.079" dur="3.27">somebody has some ideas they can post a</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="4.47">video response to this one we can maybe</text>
  <text start="241.349" dur="5.271">set up some sort of peel box that we</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="5.339">could have all the affidavits mail to or</text>
  <text start="246.62" dur="5.049">or maybe we could have a local meetup</text>
  <text start="249.239" dur="4.83">Ron Paul organizer in the three states</text>
  <text start="251.669" dur="4.261">collect all the affidavits for each</text>
  <text start="254.069" dur="3.45">state but in any case I think that</text>
  <text start="255.93" dur="4.16">through both of these methods we should</text>
  <text start="257.519" dur="5.791">be able to really get a clear</text>
  <text start="260.09" dur="4.18">independent We the People count of how</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="2.88">many people are voting for Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="264.27" dur="3.45">precinct by precinct in</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="3.21">Michigan South Carolina and Nevada and</text>
  <text start="267.72" dur="3.15">then we don&amp;#39;t have to wonder Oh was</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="4.22">their vote fraud or you know do we need</text>
  <text start="270.87" dur="4.59">to do a recount or all this stuff so I</text>
  <text start="273.62" dur="4.69">think that would just be a really good</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="5.34">idea to help ensure that these primaries</text>
  <text start="278.31" dur="6.51">that occur in these three states in this</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="6.15">next week go in a manner that is just</text>
  <text start="284.82" dur="4.95">and is accurately reflecting what people</text>
  <text start="286.95" dur="5.43">voting for so I hope we can get this I</text>
  <text start="289.77" dur="4.14">this video to go viral sorry I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="292.38" dur="2.7">able to be longer but I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="293.91" dur="2.22">pressed for time a lot of things are</text>
  <text start="295.08" dur="4.44">happening right now in my life</text>
  <text start="296.13" dur="6.15">personally and otherwise so anyway yah</text>
  <text start="299.52" dur="6.12">blast shalom and i hope this will hope</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="6.5">this will help avoid voter fraud thank</text>
  <text start="305.64" dur="3.14">you Shalom</text>
