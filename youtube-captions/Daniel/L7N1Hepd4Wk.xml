  <text start="67.17" dur="6.09">Epstein and wexner les Wexner so it</text>
  <text start="70.619" dur="5.101">looks like Epstein was also closely</text>
  <text start="73.26" dur="5.19">involved with mr. Wexner in a</text>
  <text start="75.72" dur="6.06">corporation that oversaw the</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="5.599">transformation of New Albany Ohio</text>

  <text start="112.32" dur="4.829">actually a little less than 90 miles</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="5.881">east of Dayton so I thought that was</text>
  <text start="117.149" dur="4.47">very interesting to actually place one</text>
  <text start="120" dur="3.18">of you know he has all these luxury</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="3.721">resorts right he&amp;#39;s got his Epstein</text>

  <text start="140.69" dur="4.92">to distance himself from FC now because</text>
  <text start="143.09" dur="4.65">of all the fallout trying to say that</text>
  <text start="145.61" dur="3.6">you know Epstein mismanaged his finances</text>
  <text start="147.74" dur="2.91">and all that stuff so anyway I just</text>
  <text start="149.21" dur="3.42">wanted to throw that out there that his</text>
  <text start="150.65" dur="4.41">house was actually less than ninety</text>
  <text start="152.63" dur="4.11">miles east of Dayton Ohio where again</text>
  <text start="155.06" dur="6.42">I&amp;#39;m talking about all these children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="156.74" dur="6.96">hospitals now I got some other</text>
  <text start="161.48" dur="4.56">information from just a variety of</text>
  <text start="163.7" dur="4.95">people first of all some of you may have</text>
  <text start="166.04" dur="4.67">remembered last fall late summer last</text>
  <text start="168.65" dur="4.59">fall I did a series of videos on</text>
  <text start="170.71" dur="4.45">veterans for patrol how they uncovered</text>
  <text start="173.24" dur="3.36">this huge what I think it was a child</text>
  <text start="175.16" dur="3.45">sex trafficking camp because they found</text>
  <text start="176.6" dur="4.8">all this children&amp;#39;s stuff at this camp</text>
  <text start="178.61" dur="5.37">in Arizona they tried to get the police</text>
  <text start="181.4" dur="4.35">to help them and then I wanted up</text>
  <text start="183.98" dur="3.36">getting bulldozed they thought Craig</text>
  <text start="185.75" dur="4.08">Sawyer was gonna help them in Craig soil</text>
  <text start="187.34" dur="4.53">actually willing to train veterans on</text>
  <text start="189.83" dur="4.89">patrol and working with the local police</text>
  <text start="191.87" dur="5.82">and the CIA to cover this whole thing up</text>
  <text start="194.72" dur="6.66">to sort of bulldoze it and I did some</text>
  <text start="197.69" dur="6.45">videos on that well see mix cemex which</text>
  <text start="201.38" dur="4.86">is that cement company that&amp;#39;s tied in to</text>
  <text start="204.14" dur="4.89">the Clinton Foundation tied in to the</text>
  <text start="206.24" dur="4.5">rothschilds that was actually directly</text>
  <text start="209.03" dur="5.16">implicated in that child sex trafficking</text>
  <text start="210.74" dur="4.44">camp down in southwest the United States</text>
  <text start="214.19" dur="4.44">down in Arizona</text>

  <text start="218.63" dur="6.93">least two different plants of cmx</text>
  <text start="220.37" dur="7.77">located in date which I just think is it</text>
  <text start="225.56" dur="4.44">just really really couldn&amp;#39;t be a</text>
  <text start="228.14" dur="3.36">coincidence right I mean this major</text>
  <text start="230" dur="3.84">cemex company that I believe is</text>
  <text start="231.5" dur="4.2">implicated as a front uses a vehicle by</text>
  <text start="233.84" dur="3.33">the Clinton Foundation to do the child</text>
  <text start="235.7" dur="4.31">sex trafficking to help with the money</text>
  <text start="237.17" dur="5.61">laundering and now cemex we see is in is</text>

  <text start="284.33" dur="5.37">Florida I was remembering my dad telling</text>
  <text start="286.79" dur="4.23">me stories of the tunnels in Dayton so I</text>
  <text start="289.7" dur="3.21">asked him if I was remembering correctly</text>
  <text start="291.02" dur="3.81">and he confirmed he said the tunnels</text>
  <text start="292.91" dur="4.229">were used by many manufacturers and</text>
  <text start="294.83" dur="4.5">other large employers especially during</text>
  <text start="297.139" dur="4.471">the winter months when even in the late</text>
  <text start="299.33" dur="5.58">1960s the homeless and transient</text>
  <text start="301.61" dur="5.01">population would gather my dad said it</text>
  <text start="304.91" dur="3.66">was dark and quiet and while finishing</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="4.14">his apprenticeship at Frigidaire as a</text>

  <text start="323.66" dur="4.229">connected to wright-patterson Air Force</text>
  <text start="325.37" dur="4.98">Base even then he says there was weird</text>
  <text start="327.889" dur="5.641">things going on since he was a teen in</text>
  <text start="330.35" dur="5.28">the 1950s there has been several satanic</text>
  <text start="333.53" dur="3.63">cults exposed and when I was a child I</text>
  <text start="335.63" dur="3.66">remember there were a few upper-class</text>
  <text start="337.16" dur="4.47">and political leaders that left town in</text>
  <text start="339.29" dur="4.05">the Dayton area in the middle 70s there</text>
  <text start="341.63" dur="4.44">was a serial killer who would castrate</text>
  <text start="343.34" dur="5.37">young boys in public restrooms and parks</text>
  <text start="346.07" dur="4.469">I&amp;#39;m looking for more on this I also have</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="4.23">a cousin a year younger who was a coach</text>
  <text start="350.539" dur="4.291">at the University of Dayton and was a</text>
  <text start="352.94" dur="5.13">student when the young men went missing</text>
  <text start="354.83" dur="6.05">in about 1983 1994 I&amp;#39;m waiting for him</text>
  <text start="358.07" dur="5.79">to put some memories together for me so</text>
  <text start="360.88" dur="5.17">this again just ties into the satanic</text>
  <text start="363.86" dur="3.869">ritual abuse and satanic cult oh so that</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="3.57">was going on in the Dayton area in the</text>
  <text start="367.729" dur="3.271">tunnels that I reported on last week in</text>
  <text start="369.62" dur="4.32">my first video when I truly started</text>
  <text start="371" dur="4.83">digging in to the connections of child</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="4.05">sex trafficking satanic pedophilia and</text>
  <text start="375.83" dur="5.82">these children&amp;#39;s hospitals in the Dayton</text>
  <text start="377.99" dur="5.7">Cincinnati corridor also I got another</text>

  <text start="385.07" dur="4.469">Australia and she makes a really good</text>
  <text start="386.96" dur="4.17">point she says Daniel in support of your</text>
  <text start="389.539" dur="3.561">theory that there are way too many</text>
  <text start="391.13" dur="5.19">children&amp;#39;s hospitals in the Dayton area</text>
  <text start="393.1" dur="7.1">melbourne australia has a population of</text>
  <text start="396.32" dur="7.33">nearly 5 million people and we only have</text>
  <text start="400.2" dur="6.87">Children&amp;#39;s Hospital so why would Dayton</text>
  <text start="403.65" dur="4.53">and Cincinnati need 14 children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="407.07" dur="2.31">hospitals and I thought that was a</text>
  <text start="408.18" dur="4.29">really really good point so I just</text>
  <text start="409.38" dur="5.79">wanted to I wanted to highlight that now</text>
  <text start="412.47" dur="4.77">I want to talk about the Shriners</text>
