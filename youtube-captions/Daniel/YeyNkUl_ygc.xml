  <text start="14.4" dur="8.459">sukkah which is a large tent and you can</text>
  <text start="17.91" dur="6.51">see that Shannon John&amp;#39;s wife set up a</text>
  <text start="22.859" dur="6.811">really nice to Succoth table I sort of</text>
  <text start="24.42" dur="7.23">added my my shofar to the mix but we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="52.05" dur="4.2">nice setup this is the outside of my</text>
  <text start="53.55" dur="4.649">this is the pack I have for my shofar</text>
  <text start="56.25" dur="6">there&amp;#39;s my shofar there and Shannon just</text>
  <text start="58.199" dur="5.311">did a really nice job of putting</text>
  <text start="62.25" dur="4.229">together this table you see there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="63.51" dur="4.2">scripture from acts 2:46 they broke</text>
  <text start="66.479" dur="2.941">bread in their homes and ate together</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="3.9">with glad and sincere hearts of course</text>
  <text start="69.42" dur="3.3">that&amp;#39;s the context if you read the</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="3.57">scriptures right around that that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="72.72" dur="3.03">context of the meeting every day is what</text>
  <text start="75.18" dur="2.579">our prayer</text>
  <text start="75.75" dur="4.59">zooom groom room does but this is the</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="4.65">feasts of Sukkot and you can see on the</text>
  <text start="80.34" dur="3.45">corners that&amp;#39;s the the lulav that you</text>
  <text start="82.409" dur="4.471">would shake and that comes from</text>
  <text start="83.79" dur="4.439">Leviticus 23 that I read in my earlier</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="4.11">teaching from older in the week in</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="5.311">Sukkot about waving the willow branches</text>
  <text start="90.99" dur="6.12">the palm branches that they would</text>
  <text start="93.54" dur="6.99">actually make their Sukkos out of so</text>
  <text start="97.11" dur="5.28">again the reason we set up the suka you</text>
  <text start="100.53" dur="2.31">actually set up the tent for for seven</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="3.99">days</text>
  <text start="102.84" dur="5.79">all right this year it started on Monday</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="3.87">and for that seven days you&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="108.63" dur="3.72">suka you&amp;#39;re in this temporary dwelling</text>
  <text start="110.25" dur="4.29">structure and you&amp;#39;re eating and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="112.35" dur="3.24">feasting and you&amp;#39;re having Bible studies</text>
  <text start="114.54" dur="3.21">and you&amp;#39;re just having a wonderful time</text>
  <text start="115.59" dur="4.2">and then the eighth day the last great</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="4.409">day that&amp;#39;s when you come out of the suka</text>
  <text start="119.79" dur="4.259">and again this is all about and I went</text>
  <text start="122.159" dur="4.861">into this on Monday on the first day of</text>
  <text start="124.049" dur="6.091">Sukkot which was a high Shabbat but on I</text>
  <text start="127.02" dur="6.33">talked about how this is all pointing</text>
  <text start="130.14" dur="5.79">toward the day when yah will Tabernacle</text>
  <text start="133.35" dur="5.16">man and remember during the Millennial</text>
  <text start="135.93" dur="4.14">Kingdom which is the Sabbath millennium</text>
  <text start="138.51" dur="3.81">that we&amp;#39;re coming up to pretty quickly</text>
  <text start="140.07" dur="4.17">here Yahshua Jesus is ruling and</text>
  <text start="142.32" dur="3.45">reigning with us the resurrected Saints</text>
  <text start="144.24" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;ve been transformed and resurrected</text>
  <text start="145.77" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;re ruling and reigning with him for a</text>
  <text start="147.57" dur="4.41">thousand years in Jerusalem and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="149.76" dur="3.6">a law that goes forth that says every</text>
  <text start="151.98" dur="3.8">nation has to come up to Jerusalem to</text>
  <text start="153.36" dur="5.01">keep this feast the feast of Sukkot and</text>
  <text start="155.78" dur="5.38">any nation that doesn&amp;#39;t will receive no</text>
  <text start="158.37" dur="4.41">rain and at the end of that Millennial</text>
  <text start="161.16" dur="3.45">Kingdom after the thousand-year reign is</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="4.23">over Satan of course is re-released you</text>
  <text start="164.61" dur="4.08">have that final rebellion where Satan is</text>
  <text start="167.01" dur="3">thrown into the lake of fire along with</text>
  <text start="168.69" dur="2.81">all the wicked or resurrected and</text>
  <text start="170.01" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re thrown to the lake of fire and</text>
  <text start="171.5" dur="3.85">and after that you have the new heavens</text>
  <text start="174.27" dur="3.24">and new earth and that&amp;#39;s where it talks</text>
  <text start="175.35" dur="4.02">about Yahshua Jesus delivers up his</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="4.08">kingdom to his father and now you have</text>
  <text start="179.37" dur="4.26">the fullness of yah and you have the new</text>
  <text start="181.59" dur="3.51">heavens and new earth and so when you</text>
  <text start="183.63" dur="3.69">come out of the sukkah on that last</text>
  <text start="185.1" dur="3.75">great day the eighth day that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="187.32" dur="6.54">that symbolizes that new beginning</text>
  <text start="188.85" dur="7.43">the eighth millennium and you were even</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="4.35">John chapter 7 where Jesus actually</text>
  <text start="196.28" dur="5.5">teaches during the feast of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="198.21" dur="5.28">during Tabernacles they talk about</text>
  <text start="201.78" dur="3.3">something he teaches it right in the</text>
  <text start="203.49" dur="2.7">middle the fourth day of Sukkot in the</text>
  <text start="205.08" dur="2.52">midst of the feasts and then they talk</text>
  <text start="206.19" dur="3.12">about what he says on the eighth day the</text>
  <text start="207.6" dur="3.96">last great day where he says you know</text>
  <text start="209.31" dur="4.23">living waters will come through him and</text>
  <text start="211.56" dur="4.08">gush out to others and flow out through</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="5.43">your belly and you know it that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="311.639" dur="4.081">we follow with him and he descends down</text>
  <text start="313.68" dur="3.45">to Jerusalem and with the brightness of</text>
  <text start="315.72" dur="4.169">his glory and the breath of his mouth he</text>
  <text start="317.13" dur="4.59">destroys the the son of perdition the</text>
  <text start="319.889" dur="3.601">false prophet the beast throws them into</text>
  <text start="321.72" dur="4.02">the lake of fire destroys the armies</text>
  <text start="323.49" dur="4.32">that are surrounding Jerusalem and he</text>
  <text start="325.74" dur="3.51">takes over the planet and we rule and</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="3.03">reign with him for a thousand years over</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="4.469">the people who survive the Great</text>
  <text start="330.84" dur="4.109">Tribulation and so for a thousand years</text>
  <text start="333.719" dur="3">we&amp;#39;re ruling and reigning with them in</text>
  <text start="334.949" dur="2.97">our glorified bodies and there&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="336.719" dur="2.521">know the people who survive the</text>
  <text start="337.919" dur="2.761">tribulation they&amp;#39;re having their babies</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="5.25">and multiplying on the earth and Satan&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="340.68" dur="5.489">bound in the abyss and that&amp;#39;s and and</text>
  <text start="344.49" dur="3.419">and again every nation is commanded to</text>
  <text start="346.169" dur="3.12">keep the feast of Sukkot every year and</text>
  <text start="347.909" dur="4.38">if they don&amp;#39;t come up to Jerusalem do it</text>
  <text start="349.289" dur="4.531">they&amp;#39;ll receive no rain and then after</text>
  <text start="352.289" dur="2.85">that thousand years is over at some</text>
  <text start="353.82" dur="3.06">point Satan&amp;#39;s rereleased</text>
  <text start="355.139" dur="4.411">because all those people that have been</text>
  <text start="356.88" dur="3.42">born and now that you got trillions of</text>
  <text start="359.55" dur="3.149">people on the planet Earth because</text>
  <text start="360.3" dur="4.679">there&amp;#39;s been no war no no disease you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="362.699" dur="4.71">had a perfect government for a thousand</text>
  <text start="364.979" dur="3.99">years now Satan deceives them or test</text>
  <text start="367.409" dur="3.991">them just like Adam and Eve was tested</text>
  <text start="368.969" dur="3.931">that&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;ve been tested and it</text>
  <text start="371.4" dur="3">says he deceives quite a few of them but</text>
  <text start="372.9" dur="3.509">that rebellion is pretty short-lived</text>
  <text start="374.4" dur="4.29">because fire from heaven descends down</text>
  <text start="376.409" dur="4.141">and destroy Satan and all those he</text>
  <text start="378.69" dur="2.759">deceived and they&amp;#39;re immediately thrown</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="2.76">into the lake of fire</text>
  <text start="381.449" dur="3.361">you have the great white throne judgment</text>
  <text start="383.31" dur="4.02">which is the final fulfillment of Yom</text>
  <text start="384.81" dur="3.84">Kippur after that thousand years where</text>

  <text start="394.44" dur="3.96">of Life they&amp;#39;re casted a lake of fire</text>
  <text start="395.93" dur="4.15">that&amp;#39;s the second death</text>
  <text start="398.4" dur="3.69">and then after that great white throne</text>
