  <text start="103.259" dur="4.261">and were ruling and reigning for a</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="5.4">thousand years and during this thousand</text>
  <text start="107.52" dur="4.05">year period Satan and all of his fallen</text>
  <text start="110.1" dur="3.839">angels are bound in the heart of the</text>
  <text start="111.57" dur="5.67">earth and there&amp;#39;s a perfect government</text>
  <text start="113.939" dur="4.951">and living waters were flowing from</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="3.9">Jerusalem to the Mediterranean to the</text>

  <text start="122.969" dur="4.381">Edenic form but there&amp;#39;s still sin</text>
  <text start="125.159" dur="4.171">because we read in Zechariah 14 that any</text>

  <text start="129.33" dur="4.65">every year for the feast of Sukkot which</text>

  <text start="138.54" dur="5.1">government even with no satanic</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="5.13">influence there still going to be people</text>
  <text start="143.64" dur="4.59">who choose to reject the Messiah as I</text>
  <text start="146.16" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t know how that&amp;#39;s possible when you</text>
  <text start="148.23" dur="2.67">have Jesus on the earth ruling Rennie</text>
  <text start="149.91" dur="3.78">but you still have people who reject</text>
  <text start="150.9" dur="5.01">them and so for a thousand years there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.69" dur="3.96">no war there&amp;#39;s healing waters there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="155.91" dur="5.64">perfect government and then sometime</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="5.64">after that 1000 years is over it says</text>
  <text start="161.55" dur="4.35">that Satan and his fallen angels are</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="4.35">released from their from their prison</text>

  <text start="169.29" dur="4.53">able to come back we read about this in</text>
  <text start="171.33" dur="5.04">Revelation 20 and it says they deceive</text>
  <text start="173.82" dur="4.35">masses of people remember these mortals</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="3.57">who survived the Great Tribulation that</text>
  <text start="178.17" dur="3.6">did not take the mark of the beast but</text>
  <text start="179.94" dur="4.02">also did not make the rapture or the</text>
  <text start="181.77" dur="3.75">seventh trumpet resurrection they</text>
  <text start="183.96" dur="2.79">entered into the Millennium in their</text>
  <text start="185.52" dur="4.26">regular bodies and they started having</text>
  <text start="186.75" dur="4.5">babies now we&amp;#39;re like the Angels those</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="2.46">of us who are resurrected to a part of</text>
  <text start="191.25" dur="3.15">the first resurrection</text>
  <text start="192.24" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re like the angels we&amp;#39;re ruling a</text>
  <text start="194.4" dur="2.94">reign with Jesus we don&amp;#39;t have babies</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s no marriage or even a marriage</text>
  <text start="197.34" dur="3.33">where we&amp;#39;re like the angels but these</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="2.699">mortals who survived the Great</text>
  <text start="200.67" dur="3.21">Tribulation they&amp;#39;re having babies over</text>
  <text start="201.989" dur="4.351">the thousand year period so if you</text>
  <text start="203.88" dur="4.89">imagine a thousand years with no war you</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="7.17">know living waters healing the earth the</text>
  <text start="208.77" dur="6.45">the it says the the the lion and the</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="2.97">wolf are assuming though the lamb and</text>
  <text start="215.22" dur="3.63">the wolf or whatever that scripture is</text>
  <text start="216.48" dur="3.93">they lay down together and peace it says</text>
  <text start="218.85" dur="2.85">that anyone who dies at a hundred years</text>
  <text start="220.41" dur="3.51">old will be considered like a child</text>
  <text start="221.7" dur="4.8">dying that&amp;#39;ll be a young death if you</text>
  <text start="223.92" dur="4.74">die at 100 so it&amp;#39;s all ously so you have</text>
  <text start="226.5" dur="4.44">now trillions and trillions of people</text>
  <text start="228.66" dur="4.77">down the earth because of the population</text>
  <text start="230.94" dur="4.62">explosion due to just this peace for a</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="3.66">thousand years but some time after a</text>
  <text start="235.56" dur="3.72">thousand years Satan and his fallen</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="4.41">angels are released and they tempt these</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="4.35">people who were born during the</text>
  <text start="241.5" dur="4.5">Millennium you know they were never</text>
  <text start="243.63" dur="4.47">tested and tried like we were here in</text>
  <text start="246" dur="4.17">the earth where we have all this satanic</text>
  <text start="248.1" dur="4.44">influence and the lusts of the flesh and</text>
  <text start="250.17" dur="3.75">the world and our you know our flesh</text>
  <text start="252.54" dur="4.68">that we have to crucify they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="253.92" dur="5.309">tempted by Satan they were never given</text>
  <text start="257.22" dur="3">that choice of the tree of good and evil</text>
  <text start="259.229" dur="2.701">and the tree of life</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="2.88">like Adam and Eve were so because</text>
  <text start="261.93" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;ve been living under this perfect</text>
  <text start="263.1" dur="4.38">government for a thousand years so so</text>
  <text start="265.68" dur="4.62">Satan is able to test them and it says</text>
  <text start="267.48" dur="4.29">Satan deceives so many of these people</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="3.3">that were born during the money in that</text>
  <text start="271.77" dur="4.14">his his army is like the sand of the sea</text>
  <text start="273.6" dur="4.17">and and he gathers them and he deceives</text>
  <text start="275.91" dur="3.33">them and they they basically launch an</text>
  <text start="277.77" dur="4.74">attack on the camp of the Saints on</text>
  <text start="279.24" dur="4.92">Jerusalem which is pretty foolish but</text>
  <text start="282.51" dur="4.11">their rebellion is very short-lived</text>
  <text start="284.16" dur="5.94">because fire from yah from heaven falls</text>
  <text start="286.62" dur="5.43">and consumes them and now yaa sits on</text>
  <text start="290.1" dur="4.23">the great white throne this is the final</text>
  <text start="292.05" dur="4.44">fulfillment of Yom Kippur which is what</text>
  <text start="294.33" dur="4.62">we celebrate every year for a fast day</text>
  <text start="296.49" dur="4.77">and you know a thousand years earlier</text>
  <text start="298.95" dur="4.2">Yom Kippur had been first fulfilled when</text>
  <text start="301.26" dur="3.15">we after we had been resurrected at the</text>
  <text start="303.15" dur="3.51">end of the Great Tribulation we were</text>
  <text start="304.41" dur="4.83">standing on that sea of fire and last we</text>
  <text start="306.66" dur="3.99">got our rewards but now a thousand years</text>
  <text start="309.24" dur="3.87">later now it&amp;#39;s the great white throne</text>
  <text start="310.65" dur="4.14">judgment and yah sits on that throne and</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="4.95">it says the heavens in our flee away</text>
  <text start="314.79" dur="5.34">they flee away from him and now all the</text>
  <text start="318.06" dur="3.81">wicked who&amp;#39;ve ever lived Hitler Stalin</text>
  <text start="320.13" dur="3.57">and any person who died in their sin</text>
  <text start="321.87" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re now resurrected just like we</text>
  <text start="323.7" dur="4.35">were a thousand years earlier they get</text>
  <text start="325.47" dur="4.8">new bodies just like we do the only</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="3.869">difference is they get thrown into the</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="4.14">everlasting lake of fire along with</text>
  <text start="331.919" dur="4.171">Satan and all his fallen angels where</text>
  <text start="334.41" dur="4.92">the son of perdition and the Beast have</text>
  <text start="336.09" dur="4.92">been burning for a thousand years so all</text>
  <text start="339.33" dur="4.8">the wicked that have ever lived all the</text>
  <text start="341.01" dur="4.44">devils they&amp;#39;re all thrown to the lake of</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="2.97">fire with their tormented day and night</text>
  <text start="345.45" dur="3.87">and then and then all the people that</text>
  <text start="347.1" dur="4.8">died who were born and died during the</text>
  <text start="349.32" dur="4.349">Millennium some of them may have put</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="3.42">their faith in Yahshua some of them</text>
  <text start="353.669" dur="4.831">obviously did not because they got to</text>
  <text start="355.32" dur="4.68">see by Satan those who were not and</text>
  <text start="358.5" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re not found lense but life they get</text>
  <text start="360" dur="4.2">thrown like a fire as well but those who</text>
  <text start="362.1" dur="3.96">were born and died in the Millennium and</text>
  <text start="364.2" dur="3.36">they placed their faith in Messiah they</text>
  <text start="366.06" dur="6.54">get resurrected and they now join with</text>
  <text start="367.56" dur="7.43">us so now finally death sin iniquity</text>
  <text start="372.6" dur="5.129">it&amp;#39;s finally put under Joshua&amp;#39;s feet</text>
  <text start="374.99" dur="5.95">this is after the Millennium Kingdom now</text>
  <text start="377.729" dur="7.171">it says Paul talks about how Yahshua now</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="6.06">delivers his kingdom up to the Father so</text>
  <text start="384.9" dur="3.449">as wonderful as the thousand-year reign</text>
  <text start="387" dur="3.6">is going to be and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="388.349" dur="3.451">wonderful especially for those of us</text>
  <text start="390.6" dur="2.85">to make that seventh trumpet</text>
  <text start="391.8" dur="3.51">resurrection at the end of the Great</text>
  <text start="393.45" dur="3.84">Tribulation were ruling and reigning</text>
  <text start="395.31" dur="4.01">with Yahshua for a thousand years in our</text>
  <text start="397.29" dur="4.11">resurrection is gonna be awesome but</text>
  <text start="399.32" dur="4.15">they&amp;#39;ll still be sort of pockets of</text>
  <text start="401.4" dur="3.63">rebellion and sin and and obviously this</text>
  <text start="403.47" dur="3.48">rebellion that happens after the</text>
  <text start="405.03" dur="3.57">thousand years so but now</text>
  <text start="406.95" dur="3.3">Yahshua delivers his kingdom up to the</text>
  <text start="408.6" dur="3.71">Father so now we have the new heavens</text>
  <text start="410.25" dur="4.74">and new earth the eighth millennium</text>

  <text start="748.419" dur="4.65">to be part of Philadelphia I think that</text>
  <text start="750.639" dur="4.771">Yahshua wants everyone to be part of</text>

  <text start="756.97" dur="3.869">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to go through the</text>

  <text start="770.529" dur="4.441">first video to understand this but I</text>
  <text start="772.689" dur="3.731">believe that three and a half year 42</text>
  <text start="774.97" dur="5.44">months 1206 today</text>
  <text start="776.42" dur="6.9">Great Tribulation begins in late winter</text>
  <text start="780.41" dur="5.85">early spring of 2024 and then ends in</text>
  <text start="783.32" dur="5.61">the fall of 2027 now I could be wrong I</text>
  <text start="786.26" dur="6.15">could be wrong but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="788.93" dur="6.36">personal opinion now I want to talk a</text>
  <text start="792.41" dur="4.38">little bit about the 144,000 but we read</text>
  <text start="795.29" dur="2.94">about this in the book of Revelation it</text>
  <text start="796.79" dur="3.33">says that there&amp;#39;s twelve thousand</text>
  <text start="798.23" dur="3.96">selected from every tribe of Israel</text>
  <text start="800.12" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s twelve tribes of Israel the Jews</text>
  <text start="802.19" dur="3.93">are from Judah that&amp;#39;s just one twelfth</text>
  <text start="804.14" dur="3.9">of Israel there&amp;#39;s eleven other tribes</text>
  <text start="806.12" dur="3.33">and it says that there&amp;#39;s twelve thousand</text>
  <text start="808.04" dur="4.16">these are virgins</text>
  <text start="809.45" dur="4.32">I don&amp;#39;t believe virgins is literal I</text>
  <text start="812.2" dur="4.45">believe it means that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="813.77" dur="5.4">defiled by women in other words women or</text>
  <text start="816.65" dur="5.04">the woman the whore is talked about off</text>
  <text start="819.17" dur="4.17">in Scripture and these individuals are</text>
  <text start="821.69" dur="3.78">not defiled by the horror they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="823.34" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;ve repented of the paganism of the</text>
  <text start="825.47" dur="4.35">world and they&amp;#39;re wholly consecrated to</text>
  <text start="827.78" dur="3.84">Yahshua covered by the blood of the</text>
  <text start="829.82" dur="5.04">Spirit they&amp;#39;re obeying the torat of a</text>
  <text start="831.62" dur="6.24">love for Jesus these are the 144,000 and</text>
  <text start="834.86" dur="5.13">I think a lot of 144,000 don&amp;#39;t even know</text>
  <text start="837.86" dur="6.09">who they are they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;ve just</text>
  <text start="839.99" dur="5.7">been raised up they&amp;#39;ve been purified and</text>
  <text start="843.95" dur="3.03">made pure and white because of the</text>
  <text start="845.69" dur="2.76">persecution they&amp;#39;ve gone through their</text>
  <text start="846.98" dur="4.65">lives and they don&amp;#39;t even know who they</text>
  <text start="848.45" dur="4.92">are but it says these 144,000 are raised</text>
  <text start="851.63" dur="3.81">up in the end days and that they have</text>
  <text start="853.37" dur="4.04">the seal of yah on them and that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="855.44" dur="5.73">protected they&amp;#39;re divinely protected</text>
  <text start="857.41" dur="6.85">from these you know horrific things that</text>
  <text start="861.17" dur="4.98">begin to happen on the earth and I</text>
  <text start="864.26" dur="4.86">believe these 144,000 have a specific</text>
  <text start="866.15" dur="5.43">purpose not only to teach people and to</text>
  <text start="869.12" dur="3.9">lead people closer to Christ but says</text>
  <text start="871.58" dur="3.54">they follow the lamb whithersoever he</text>
  <text start="873.02" dur="6.33">goes and I believe that they are raised</text>
  <text start="875.12" dur="7.85">up to help lead the Philadelphian</text>
  <text start="879.35" dur="6.36">remnant into that safe place or at least</text>
  <text start="882.97" dur="4.45">instruct people like you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="885.71" dur="3.72">think anyone&amp;#39;s gonna be able to prepare</text>
  <text start="887.42" dur="3.15">or use the arm of the flesh to get to</text>
  <text start="889.43" dur="2.97">the safe place I think it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="890.57" dur="4.32">more like an axe chapter 8 where you</text>
  <text start="892.4" dur="4.92">know Phillip the Evangelist he&amp;#39;s he</text>
  <text start="894.89" dur="3.93">baptizes that Ethiopian eunuch and as</text>
  <text start="897.32" dur="3.03">soon as he&amp;#39;s done baptizing him it says</text>
  <text start="898.82" dur="3.48">the spirit II I came like a whirlwind it</text>
  <text start="900.35" dur="3.42">took Philip away and then he&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="902.3" dur="3.54">hundreds of miles north of northern</text>
  <text start="903.77" dur="3.66">Israel he starts preaching I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="905.84" dur="2.64">gonna be like that or this you know the</text>
  <text start="907.43" dur="3.11">144,000</text>
  <text start="908.48" dur="4.409">and those that they&amp;#39;re teaching and</text>
  <text start="910.54" dur="3.88">instructing that you know we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="912.889" dur="3.331">doing the working hours we&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="914.42" dur="3.69">about doing the father&amp;#39;s business which</text>
  <text start="916.22" dur="4.859">is what we all should be doing is blood</text>
  <text start="918.11" dur="4.469">blood wash servants of Messiah and then</text>
  <text start="921.079" dur="3.181">all of a sudden that you know right at</text>
  <text start="922.579" dur="3.69">that Great Tribulation beginning the</text>
  <text start="924.26" dur="2.43">spear Diaw just supernaturally takes us</text>
  <text start="926.269" dur="3.51">there</text>
  <text start="926.69" dur="5.73">somehow to that safe place you know not</text>
  <text start="929.779" dur="6.3">by might not by power by my spirit says</text>
  <text start="932.42" dur="5.13">Yahweh so so who are these 144,000 well</text>
  <text start="936.079" dur="3.87">I think there are all types of people</text>
  <text start="937.55" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re janitors they&amp;#39;re journalists</text>
  <text start="939.949" dur="4.981">they&amp;#39;re carpenters they&amp;#39;re businessmen</text>

  <text start="955.639" dur="3.991">of that 144,000 but I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="958.43" dur="4.08">probably spread out across the entire</text>
  <text start="959.63" dur="4.98">world right now and they&amp;#39;re being raised</text>
  <text start="962.51" dur="3.509">up in different vocations and different</text>

  <text start="976.97" dur="3.9">probably help expose the Satanic</text>
  <text start="978.8" dur="3.93">pedophiles and all these things so I do</text>

  <text start="988.85" dur="2.37">beginning of the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="989.93" dur="4.38">because once that Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="991.22" dur="4.65">begins remember Jesus talked about how</text>

  <text start="1225.539" dur="4.651">witnesses these two men that preach for</text>
  <text start="1228.169" dur="3.671">1260 days well it says it is appointed</text>
  <text start="1230.19" dur="3.479">unto man wants to die and then the</text>
  <text start="1231.84" dur="4.5">judgment in fact the only group of</text>
  <text start="1233.669" dur="4.291">people that don&amp;#39;t die are those who make</text>
  <text start="1236.34" dur="3.12">it to the safe place and they are</text>
  <text start="1237.96" dur="4.74">protected during that three and a half</text>
  <text start="1239.46" dur="4.62">year tribulation and Paul talks about he</text>
  <text start="1242.7" dur="2.939">says you know the dead Messiah rise</text>
  <text start="1244.08" dur="4.02">first and then they who are alive and</text>
  <text start="1245.639" dur="4.53">remain at the coming of the Lord they so</text>
  <text start="1248.1" dur="3.569">they never taste death but other than</text>

  <text start="1251.669" dur="3.781">appointed unto man once to die and then</text>
  <text start="1252.869" dur="4.92">the judgment so what two men never died</text>
  <text start="1255.45" dur="3.659">in Scripture well a lot of people say</text>
  <text start="1257.789" dur="3.661">Elijah but that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="1259.109" dur="4.471">Elijah was caught up in a chariot but it</text>
  <text start="1261.45" dur="4.349">did not take him to heaven folks I have</text>
  <text start="1263.58" dur="3.839">a whole study about this on my on my</text>
  <text start="1265.799" dur="4.35">website I could prove this through</text>
  <text start="1267.419" dur="4.801">scripture that Elijah was taken up in a</text>
  <text start="1270.149" dur="4.051">fiery chariot but only taken to another</text>
  <text start="1272.22" dur="4.35">part of Israel because five years after</text>
  <text start="1274.2" dur="4.799">that incident he&amp;#39;s still on earth and he</text>
  <text start="1276.57" dur="3.03">writes a letter to an apostate king of</text>
  <text start="1278.999" dur="3.841">Israel to</text>
  <text start="1279.6" dur="4.949">rebuked him and so Elijah just gets</text>
  <text start="1282.84" dur="4.77">carried from one place to another and</text>
  <text start="1284.549" dur="5.791">then he dies like a normal man so Elijah</text>
  <text start="1287.61" dur="4.11">dies Moses dies he&amp;#39;s all dying but there</text>
  <text start="1290.34" dur="5.459">are two men in Scripture that never die</text>
  <text start="1291.72" dur="6.089">one is Enoch Enoch says he was just</text>
  <text start="1295.799" dur="4.891">walking with yah and then at the age of</text>
  <text start="1297.809" dur="5.101">365 he suddenly is no more he gets</text>
  <text start="1300.69" dur="4.2">translated so he gets take away now I</text>
  <text start="1302.91" dur="3.93">know there&amp;#39;s this book of Enoch that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1304.89" dur="3.419">out there right now it&amp;#39;s completely has</text>
  <text start="1306.84" dur="3.24">nothing to do with the biblical Enoch</text>
  <text start="1308.309" dur="2.701">okay this is this so-called Book of</text>
  <text start="1310.08" dur="3.66">Enoch is a hoax</text>
  <text start="1311.01" dur="5.85">it contradicts the scriptures and should</text>
  <text start="1313.74" dur="4.65">burn that Jude quotes from the biblical</text>
  <text start="1316.86" dur="3.21">Enoch but that&amp;#39;s not the book we have to</text>
  <text start="1318.39" dur="4.019">do it anyway so Enoch is one of them and</text>
  <text start="1320.07" dur="4.859">then Apostle John in the New Testament</text>
  <text start="1322.409" dur="4.89">that the one that says he puts his face</text>
  <text start="1324.929" dur="3.541">on Yahshua&amp;#39;s breast it says the disciple</text>
  <text start="1327.299" dur="4.171">whom Yahshua loved he was the most</text>
  <text start="1328.47" dur="4.8">closest disciple to Jesus was Apostle</text>
  <text start="1331.47" dur="4.47">John John wrote the book of Revelation</text>
  <text start="1333.27" dur="6.32">and he wrote the Gospel of John and he</text>
  <text start="1335.94" dur="6.119">wrote first and second third Jung and</text>
  <text start="1339.59" dur="4.87">it&amp;#39;s interesting I found a book once</text>
  <text start="1342.059" dur="5.071">that showed all the different tombs of</text>
  <text start="1344.46" dur="5.52">the eleven apostles but they never found</text>
  <text start="1347.13" dur="4.14">a tomb for John all the other eleven</text>
  <text start="1349.98" dur="3.569">apostles were persecuted they were</text>
  <text start="1351.27" dur="4.889">murdered and they were murdered and they</text>
  <text start="1353.549" dur="4.291">died they tried to murder John they</text>
  <text start="1356.159" dur="4.5">actually tried to boil him in a pot of</text>
  <text start="1357.84" dur="5.16">oil but he wouldn&amp;#39;t die so in</text>
  <text start="1360.659" dur="3.871">frustration the Roman Empire exiled him</text>
  <text start="1363" dur="3.44">to the island of Patmos where that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1364.53" dur="4.769">where he received the book of Revelation</text>
  <text start="1366.44" dur="5.8">somehow the book of Revelation wound up</text>
  <text start="1369.299" dur="4.711">in Ephesus and even though I mean if you</text>
  <text start="1372.24" dur="3.809">study the Roman Empire during the first</text>
  <text start="1374.01" dur="5.159">century if you get exiled to an island I</text>
  <text start="1376.049" dur="5.37">mean you&amp;#39;re cut off from society those</text>
  <text start="1379.169" dur="3.691">Roman centurions on penalty of death</text>
  <text start="1381.419" dur="2.671">have to make sure you have no</text>
  <text start="1382.86" dur="3.179">communication with the outside world</text>
  <text start="1384.09" dur="4.29">and yet somehow his Scrolls of</text>
  <text start="1386.039" dur="5.761">Revelation get disseminated they never</text>
  <text start="1388.38" dur="7.02">find a tomb for the Apostle John and</text>
  <text start="1391.8" dur="6.15">in Revelation 10 it says when yaws</text>
  <text start="1395.4" dur="5.49">speaking to John it says you will yet</text>
  <text start="1397.95" dur="5.67">testify before kings and princes and</text>
  <text start="1400.89" dur="4.23">governors well John never does that</text>
  <text start="1403.62" dur="3">because when he receives that revelation</text>
  <text start="1405.12" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s toward the end of his life he&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="1406.62" dur="5.04">the island of Patmos he&amp;#39;s been exiled he</text>
  <text start="1408.45" dur="5.97">never does testify and yet it says that</text>
  <text start="1411.66" dur="5.149">he will and and Jesus makes a very</text>
  <text start="1414.42" dur="4.62">interesting statement about John Peter</text>
  <text start="1416.809" dur="4.721">asked Jesus and says what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1419.04" dur="4.47">happen to John and Jesus said what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1421.53" dur="3.36">that to you if he should remain until my</text>
  <text start="1423.51" dur="3.48">return what&amp;#39;s that to you and so this</text>
  <text start="1424.89" dur="4.74">rumor went abroad that John would be</text>
  <text start="1426.99" dur="4.68">their win Messiah return in fact Messiah</text>
  <text start="1429.63" dur="4.11">even said there would be some standing</text>
  <text start="1431.67" dur="3.6">here today that that will not die until</text>
  <text start="1433.74" dur="3.96">they see the Son of man returning in the</text>
  <text start="1435.27" dur="4.23">clouds well how is that possible when</text>
  <text start="1437.7" dur="3.96">Jesus has not yet returned and it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1439.5" dur="4.59">2,000 years well there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="1441.66" dur="4.5">possibilities one I talked about in my</text>
  <text start="1444.09" dur="4.23">first video about Judas Iscariot who did</text>
  <text start="1446.16" dur="4.89">kill himself but he&amp;#39;s brought back as</text>
  <text start="1448.32" dur="4.83">the son of perdition so there&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="1451.05" dur="5.67">person that&amp;#39;s still yet standing when</text>
  <text start="1453.15" dur="7.2">Messiah returns in the clouds but also</text>
  <text start="1456.72" dur="6.63">fossils John he&amp;#39;s preserved like Enoch</text>
  <text start="1460.35" dur="5.13">and he is brought back of a scene like</text>
  <text start="1463.35" dur="4.95">you know and I believe John now I could</text>
  <text start="1465.48" dur="4.53">be wrong I&amp;#39;m not dogmatic about this but</text>
  <text start="1468.3" dur="3.03">I just believe the scriptural record in</text>
  <text start="1470.01" dur="4.35">the historical record seems to indicate</text>
  <text start="1471.33" dur="5.64">that Enoch and Apostle John are the two</text>
  <text start="1474.36" dur="4.02">witnesses and they&amp;#39;ll be slaughtered for</text>
  <text start="1476.97" dur="3.06">three and a half days but at the end of</text>

  <text start="1485.97" dur="2.76">there&amp;#39;ll be some who&amp;#39;s standing here</text>
  <text start="1487.32" dur="3.41">right now that will be standing when I</text>
  <text start="1488.73" dur="4.98">return and when he returns on the clouds</text>
