  <text start="479.73" dur="6.3">seeking after me for some when they had</text>
  <text start="483.81" dur="6">heard did provoke help yet not all that</text>
  <text start="486.03" dur="6.36">came out of Egypt by Moses but with whom</text>
  <text start="489.81" dur="4.44">was he grieved 40 years was it not with</text>
  <text start="492.39" dur="4.77">them that had sinned whose carcasses</text>
  <text start="494.25" dur="4.89">fell in the wilderness and to whom swear</text>
  <text start="497.16" dur="4.86">he that they should not enter into his</text>
  <text start="499.14" dur="5.04">rest but to them that believe not so we</text>
  <text start="502.02" dur="5.37">see that we could not enter in because</text>
  <text start="504.18" dur="6.66">of that we see that they could not enter</text>
  <text start="507.39" dur="5.01">in because of unbelief it all started</text>
  <text start="510.84" dur="3.75">with unbelieving all started with a lack</text>
  <text start="512.4" dur="4.38">of putting their complete trust in yah</text>
  <text start="514.59" dur="4.17">which is actually pretty amazing because</text>
  <text start="516.78" dur="4.05">if you think about what they beheld with</text>
  <text start="518.76" dur="3.48">their own eyes I mean they saw Egypt</text>
  <text start="520.83" dur="4.05">getting destroyed by all these plagues</text>
  <text start="522.24" dur="4.78">and then they saw y&amp;#39;all part the Red Sea</text>
  <text start="524.88" dur="6.15">and they and they saw y&amp;#39;all do all these</text>
  <text start="527.02" dur="7.56">miracles and yet they decided to get</text>
  <text start="531.03" dur="7.84">complain and and bicker and and really</text>
  <text start="534.58" dur="8.13">not continue in yo so but that that is</text>
  <text start="538.87" dur="5.64">an example for us well you know I was</text>
  <text start="542.71" dur="4.17">just talking with everyone last night</text>
  <text start="544.51" dur="4.35">about how we didn&amp;#39;t know who the author</text>
  <text start="546.88" dur="3.81">was and now this you know we&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="548.86" dur="3.72">well it doesn&amp;#39;t sound like Paul but you</text>
  <text start="550.69" dur="4.86">know Hebrews 1 sounds a lot like first</text>
  <text start="552.58" dur="5.19">John chapter 1 but he was three sounds a</text>
  <text start="555.55" dur="6.03">lot like first Corinthians where Paul</text>
  <text start="557.77" dur="6.57">talks about Paul talks about how the</text>
  <text start="561.58" dur="5.19">exodus is a model for us so I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="564.34" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;m gonna go to my theory about how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="566.77" dur="3.42">a combination of Paul and John working</text>
  <text start="568.78" dur="3.63">together that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I keep</text>
  <text start="570.19" dur="4.53">thinking of because right between these</text>
  <text start="572.41" dur="6.87">in these three chapters i see i see john</text>
