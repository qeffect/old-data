  <text start="0.29" dur="8.139">shabbat shalom this is Daniel John Lee</text>
  <text start="3.75" dur="7.94">with Torah restoration ministries sorry</text>
  <text start="8.429" dur="6.66">I have to kind of do this on my own here</text>
  <text start="11.69" dur="6.13">it is the it&amp;#39;s now Friday night December</text>
  <text start="15.089" dur="6.391">the first first day of December 2017 and</text>
  <text start="17.82" dur="4.77">it is the 14th day of the ninth Hueber</text>
  <text start="21.48" dur="2.94">month which means we&amp;#39;re only about</text>
  <text start="22.59" dur="3.75">eleven days out from Hanukkah which is</text>
  <text start="24.42" dur="3.779">pretty amazing how fast the year is</text>
  <text start="26.34" dur="5.519">going it feels like we just finished the</text>
  <text start="28.199" dur="6.871">coat in any case I&amp;#39;ve had a number of</text>
  <text start="31.859" dur="5.461">requests to make a prophetic timeline</text>
  <text start="35.07" dur="4.59">video I&amp;#39;ve done a couple of these before</text>
  <text start="37.32" dur="6.87">but it just seems like people still</text>
  <text start="39.66" dur="6.51">don&amp;#39;t have the prophetic events sort of</text>
  <text start="44.19" dur="3.029">center fright in their head and and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="46.17" dur="3.93">kind of important that we understand</text>
  <text start="47.219" dur="6.691">that because if you if you read the Book</text>
  <text start="50.1" dur="5.279">of Daniel the book of Revelation the</text>
  <text start="53.91" dur="3.919">minor and major prophets The Book of</text>
  <text start="55.379" dur="5.43">Psalms you know yah does provide enough</text>
  <text start="57.829" dur="4.78">understanding and wisdom especially for</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="3.99">obeying the Torah and we&amp;#39;re keeping the</text>
  <text start="62.609" dur="3.751">feast days to be able to put these key</text>
  <text start="64.799" dur="3.721">prophetic events in the right timeline</text>
  <text start="66.36" dur="4.86">this idea that well no one really knows</text>
  <text start="68.52" dur="4.529">is really not true Yahweh wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="71.22" dur="3.84">given this revelation to John and Daniel</text>
  <text start="73.049" dur="5.881">and the major prophets unless he wanted</text>
  <text start="75.06" dur="6.33">us to know so the Bible says in psalm</text>
  <text start="78.93" dur="4.32">119 that if we obey his Torah he will</text>
  <text start="81.39" dur="3.45">make us wiser than the ancients so I</text>
  <text start="83.25" dur="2.67">obey his Torah I do as much of the</text>
  <text start="84.84" dur="3.54">tourists possible out of a love for</text>
  <text start="85.92" dur="4.17">Yahshua I am filled the spirit I&amp;#39;m told</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="4.77">the fruits of the spirit I&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="90.09" dur="7.139">ministry now since 2003 so almost twenty</text>
  <text start="93.15" dur="6.21">years and I this is bathed in a lot of</text>
  <text start="97.229" dur="4.291">prayer and study and actually walking it</text>
  <text start="99.36" dur="6">out so what I&amp;#39;m going to present to you</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="5.489">is it&amp;#39;s from the scripture I&amp;#39;ll provide</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="3">the scripture references for the most</text>
  <text start="107.009" dur="3.511">part but it&amp;#39;s in the scripture you can</text>
  <text start="108.36" dur="5.07">verify it and this is how it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="110.52" dur="5.34">be so there&amp;#39;s not error I don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="113.43" dur="4.799">actual timing but in terms of the cause</text>
  <text start="115.86" dur="4.68">and effect events we can see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="118.229" dur="5.131">going to happen so without further ado</text>
  <text start="120.54" dur="5.88">let&amp;#39;s get into it now I&amp;#39;m gonna use</text>
  <text start="123.36" dur="4.83">actual dates not because I&amp;#39;m saying this</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="2.94">is the dates that this is stuff gonna</text>
  <text start="128.19" dur="3.48">occur but I just think it&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>
  <text start="129.36" dur="4.09">interesting if we can put it on to an</text>
  <text start="131.67" dur="4">actual calendar</text>
  <text start="133.45" dur="5.58">of real-time events here I think this is</text>
  <text start="135.67" dur="7.46">easier I&amp;#39;ll just sit down here um you</text>
  <text start="139.03" dur="10.92">guys can hear me turn that off for now</text>
  <text start="143.13" dur="10.51">in case you can&amp;#39;t hear me so I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="149.95" dur="6.24">I&amp;#39;m gonna structure these events into</text>
  <text start="153.64" dur="4.11">into an actual into actual dates but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="156.19" dur="3.18">not saying best save yah these are the</text>
  <text start="157.75" dur="3.51">days I&amp;#39;m just putting it into these</text>
  <text start="159.37" dur="5.46">dates just so you can get a feel and</text>
  <text start="161.26" dur="5.759">understanding of how theoretically these</text>
  <text start="164.83" dur="3.81">events would go forward so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="167.019" dur="3.03">gonna do is we&amp;#39;re gonna assume that</text>
  <text start="168.64" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re gonna say that the Great</text>
  <text start="170.049" dur="4.801">Tribulation is going to begin this next</text>
  <text start="172.42" dur="3.66">winter and spring now why do I say the</text>
  <text start="174.85" dur="2.969">Great Tribulation will begin in the</text>
  <text start="176.08" dur="4.469">winter and spring well because Jesus</text>
  <text start="177.819" dur="3.901">Yahshua said in the Gospels he might</text>
  <text start="180.549" dur="3.27">have said it in all four but I know he</text>
  <text start="181.72" dur="4.89">said at least two he said very clearly</text>
  <text start="183.819" dur="5.101">and you can look this up pray that your</text>
  <text start="186.61" dur="4.98">flight be not in winter or on the</text>
  <text start="188.92" dur="5.19">Sabbath day because when it is that is</text>
  <text start="191.59" dur="3.899">when Great Tribulation will begin so we</text>
  <text start="194.11" dur="2.939">know from the book of Revelation of the</text>
  <text start="195.489" dur="4.381">Great Tribulation is a three and a half</text>
  <text start="197.049" dur="7.051">year period it is 42 months 1260 days or</text>
  <text start="199.87" dur="6.6">1290 days three and a half years it is a</text>
  <text start="204.1" dur="4.44">time times and half a time it is that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.47" dur="5.37">that is the Great Tribulation and so we</text>
  <text start="208.54" dur="5.669">know that it&amp;#39;s going to begin on some</text>
  <text start="211.84" dur="4.29">Sabbath day in the winter and and I</text>
  <text start="214.209" dur="4.291">believe that is pointing toward Purim</text>
  <text start="216.13" dur="5.13">because all the feast days have key</text>
  <text start="218.5" dur="4.95">prophetic things involving both his</text>
  <text start="221.26" dur="4.83">first return and the second return and</text>
  <text start="223.45" dur="4.86">perm has not yet been fulfilled and perm</text>
  <text start="226.09" dur="3.989">is one of those feasts it&amp;#39;s not one of</text>
  <text start="228.31" dur="3.899">the seven major feasts but it is one of</text>
  <text start="230.079" dur="3.931">the nine feasts that we see in Zephaniah</text>
  <text start="232.209" dur="3.421">when we see the menorah and then the two</text>
  <text start="234.01" dur="4.5">olive trees on either side making nine</text>
  <text start="235.63" dur="6.15">plus we have that nine honey Kia that we</text>
  <text start="238.51" dur="5.039">use every Hanukkah so there is nine not</text>
  <text start="241.78" dur="4.2">just seven and perm is one of those nine</text>
  <text start="243.549" dur="4.231">and so Purim is the only feast II that</text>
  <text start="245.98" dur="5.039">happens in the winter and on a Sabbath</text>
  <text start="247.78" dur="5.549">day and it involves a type of Antichrist</text>
  <text start="251.019" dur="5.011">it involves Haman which is a type of</text>
  <text start="253.329" dur="4.861">Antichrist so and it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="256.03" dur="3.509">slaughtering the Jewish people so this</text>
  <text start="258.19" dur="3.87">is definitely pointing toward the Great</text>
  <text start="259.539" dur="5.851">Tribulation Hanukah also occurs in the</text>
  <text start="262.06" dur="4.12">winter but it&amp;#39;s more toward about the</text>
  <text start="265.39" dur="2.29">temple and dead</text>
  <text start="266.18" dur="3.6">came the temple and rededicated temple</text>
  <text start="267.68" dur="3.209">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pointing toward the</text>
  <text start="269.78" dur="3.479">Millennial Kingdom not the Great</text>
  <text start="270.889" dur="8.641">Tribulation perm is about Great</text>
  <text start="273.259" dur="8.791">Tribulation so so that&amp;#39;s how we know</text>
  <text start="279.53" dur="3.389">it&amp;#39;s gonna begin now some people may say</text>
  <text start="282.05" dur="2.52">well wait a minute three and a half</text>
  <text start="282.919" dur="2.761">years I thought it was seven years what</text>
  <text start="284.57" dur="2.849">about the seven years that they talked</text>
  <text start="285.68" dur="3.18">about Daniel the last the final Daniels</text>
  <text start="287.419" dur="4.021">week how Lindsay and all these prophetic</text>
  <text start="288.86" dur="4.41">gurus say seven years yes there was</text>
  <text start="291.44" dur="3.33">seven years that was laid out in the</text>
  <text start="293.27" dur="3.69">Book of Daniel Daniel chapter nine but</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="5.19">when you go to Revelation which was</text>
  <text start="296.96" dur="4.17">written after Jesus Christ walked the</text>
  <text start="299.96" dur="2.67">earth after Yahshua walked the earth</text>
  <text start="301.13" dur="3.24">there&amp;#39;s only three and a half years</text>
  <text start="302.63" dur="4.379">there is no seven-year mentioned in fact</text>
  <text start="304.37" dur="5.01">I challenge you read revelation 1</text>
  <text start="307.009" dur="5.041">through was it 22 read the entire book</text>
  <text start="309.38" dur="4.92">tell me any place where it says seven</text>
  <text start="312.05" dur="5.19">years they won&amp;#39;t and the reason why is</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="4.86">because if you read Daniel 9 it says he</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="4.26">in the midst of the week will be cut off</text>
  <text start="319.16" dur="4.11">but not for himself that is Yahshua that</text>
  <text start="321.5" dur="4.139">is Jesus Christ who was cut off on the</text>
  <text start="323.27" dur="3.989">cross not for himself but for our sake</text>
  <text start="325.639" dur="4.101">for the sake of Israel for the sake of</text>
  <text start="327.259" dur="4.771">art our sins he was that sacrifice so</text>
  <text start="329.74" dur="4.57">Jesus fulfilled the first three and a</text>
  <text start="332.03" dur="3.66">half years of that seven-year period he</text>
  <text start="334.31" dur="3.18">had a three and a half year ministry to</text>
  <text start="335.69" dur="3.84">that two thousand years ago and just</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="4.29">like the real yash of Nazareth got his</text>
  <text start="339.53" dur="3.449">three and a half years on earth and then</text>
  <text start="341.78" dur="3.6">he was cut off in the midst of the week</text>
  <text start="342.979" dur="4.5">so to the counterfeit Jesus the</text>
  <text start="345.38" dur="3.539">counterfeit Yeshua is gonna get his</text>
  <text start="347.479" dur="3.031">three and a half years and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="348.919" dur="3.421">the Great Tribulation is all about so</text>
  <text start="350.51" dur="4.56">there is a two thousand year time of the</text>
  <text start="352.34" dur="4.889">Gentile between the three and a half</text>
  <text start="355.07" dur="4.05">years that Yahshua of Nazareth fulfilled</text>
  <text start="357.229" dur="4.201">and ended when he died on the cross and</text>
  <text start="359.12" dur="3.87">rose again and then the three-and-a-half</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="4.26">years that the son of perdition is gonna</text>
  <text start="362.99" dur="4.169">fulfill so there&amp;#39;s no more seven-year</text>
  <text start="365.69" dur="3.15">period because three and a half years of</text>
  <text start="367.159" dur="3.811">those were fulfilled in the Gospels and</text>
  <text start="368.84" dur="3.48">so by the time revelation is written you</text>
  <text start="370.97" dur="3.24">only have three and a half years left</text>
  <text start="372.32" dur="4.56">and that has that is still yet in our</text>
  <text start="374.21" dur="4.35">future some people say well Daniel what</text>
  <text start="376.88" dur="3.21">about these pre Duras and these project</text>
  <text start="378.56" dur="3.51">leaders that point out that many of the</text>
  <text start="380.09" dur="4.199">events Jesus describes in Matthew 24</text>
  <text start="382.07" dur="4.86">were fulfilled in the first century well</text>
  <text start="384.289" dur="6.481">that&amp;#39;s true their history ISM is a</text>
  <text start="386.93" dur="6.81">cyclical pattern okay it&amp;#39;s a cyclical</text>
  <text start="390.77" dur="5.67">pattern and it repeats itself over and</text>
  <text start="393.74" dur="5.149">over and over again and and so we do see</text>
  <text start="396.44" dur="4.55">some elements fulfilled in</text>
  <text start="398.889" dur="4.291">6780 the three and a half years that</text>
  <text start="400.99" dur="4.35">occurred between 67 and 70 AD when</text>
  <text start="403.18" dur="3.84">Jerusalem was destroyed but we see that</text>
  <text start="405.34" dur="4.32">same three-and-a-half year pattern</text>
  <text start="407.02" dur="5.28">repeated in the Dark Ages we see it in</text>
  <text start="409.66" dur="4.229">the Reformation we see it repeated many</text>
  <text start="412.3" dur="3.6">times I think there&amp;#39;s even a three and a</text>
  <text start="413.889" dur="3.511">half year period you can you can find in</text>
  <text start="415.9" dur="2.34">world war two toward the end of Adolf</text>
  <text start="417.4" dur="3.51">Hitler&amp;#39;s reign</text>
  <text start="418.24" dur="4.17">so that patterns been repeated but</text>
  <text start="420.91" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;ve never had the fullness of the</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="4.5">events as described in Revelation ever</text>
  <text start="424.51" dur="5.55">to have occurred and that&amp;#39;s still yet in</text>
  <text start="426.91" dur="5.19">our future so that&amp;#39;s what we have to</text>
  <text start="430.06" dur="3.479">understand is that there&amp;#39;s only three</text>
  <text start="432.1" dur="3.539">and a half years left that&amp;#39;s known as</text>
  <text start="433.539" dur="4.951">the Great Tribulation is described in</text>
  <text start="435.639" dur="4.891">the Book of Daniel as 1290 days 1260</text>
  <text start="438.49" dur="4.58">days it&amp;#39;s described in Revelation as</text>
  <text start="440.53" dur="5.009">1260 days three and a half years</text>
  <text start="443.07" dur="4.87">forty-two months a time times and half a</text>
  <text start="445.539" dur="4.981">time that is the period that is facing</text>
  <text start="447.94" dur="5.52">us before we can get to to be with him</text>
  <text start="450.52" dur="4.5">in the clouds okay so it&amp;#39;s a three and a</text>
  <text start="453.46" dur="3.179">half year Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="455.02" dur="4.11">there is no pre-tribulation rapture</text>
  <text start="456.639" dur="3.961">that&amp;#39;s a myth the seventh trumpet</text>
  <text start="459.13" dur="3.39">resurrection has described in 1st</text>
  <text start="460.6" dur="4.41">Thessalonians 4 that will occur on some</text>
  <text start="462.52" dur="4.47">future yom teruah that happens at the</text>
  <text start="465.01" dur="3.24">end of the Great Tribulation since we</text>
  <text start="466.99" dur="2.82">know it&amp;#39;s three-and-a-half years and</text>
  <text start="468.25" dur="3.27">since we know from Jesus&amp;#39;s own words</text>
  <text start="469.81" dur="3.72">that will begin in the late winter early</text>
  <text start="471.52" dur="3.42">spring because he said pray that your</text>
  <text start="473.53" dur="2.43">flight be not on winter on the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="474.94" dur="3.18">day because then will be Great</text>
  <text start="475.96" dur="4.38">Tribulation so we know it begins on some</text>
  <text start="478.12" dur="4.32">future Purim then if you count three and</text>
  <text start="480.34" dur="3.87">a half years later it will end on some</text>
  <text start="482.44" dur="3.57">future fall feast and that makes sense</text>
  <text start="484.21" dur="4.44">because he fulfilled the spring feasts</text>
  <text start="486.01" dur="5.279">He fulfilled Passover unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="488.65" dur="3.9">firstfruits and in Shavuot he is not yet</text>
  <text start="491.289" dur="8.541">fulfilled the fall feast that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="492.55" dur="7.28">coming up okay so we&amp;#39;re gonna start on</text>
  <text start="500.13" dur="9.37">poems of 2018 my dad is gonna be I just</text>
  <text start="507.099" dur="6.69">banged my elbow that&amp;#39;s gonna be that</text>
  <text start="509.5" dur="6.24">next year that&amp;#39;s March 2nd and 3rd which</text>
  <text start="513.789" dur="3.18">happens to be a Friday and Saturday so</text>
  <text start="515.74" dur="3.539">it&amp;#39;s literally gonna be on a weekly</text>
  <text start="516.969" dur="4.62">Sabbath which i think is interesting so</text>
  <text start="519.279" dur="3.991">let&amp;#39;s say that that&amp;#39;s the day when the</text>
  <text start="521.589" dur="2.611">Great Tribulation begins well if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.27" dur="3.87">the day when the Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="524.2" dur="6.56">begins what we&amp;#39;ll see around Purim those</text>
  <text start="527.14" dur="6.38">two days is we will see Satan cast down</text>
  <text start="530.76" dur="6.65">that happens to the earth that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="533.52" dur="6.06">Revelation 12 and when he gets cast down</text>
  <text start="537.41" dur="3.43">whenever when anything something major</text>
  <text start="539.58" dur="3.54">spiritual happens it manifests</text>
  <text start="540.84" dur="3.75">physically so when he gets cast down the</text>
  <text start="543.12" dur="5.67">physical effects that we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="544.59" dur="5.82">are seal six which is a huge earthquake</text>
  <text start="548.79" dur="3.09">and that looks like the stars are</text>
  <text start="550.41" dur="6.84">falling it&amp;#39;s a huge shaking of the earth</text>
  <text start="551.88" dur="6.63">and we also see trumpet five now</text>
  <text start="557.25" dur="2.91">something you may say well wait a minute</text>
  <text start="558.51" dur="3.03">you&amp;#39;re saying this is the very beginning</text>
  <text start="560.16" dur="3.09">of the Great Tribulation yet you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="561.54" dur="4.08">already on seal six and trumbo five how</text>
  <text start="563.25" dur="5.22">is it possible well that&amp;#39;s because the</text>
  <text start="565.62" dur="4.35">first five seals and the first four</text>
  <text start="568.47" dur="3.03">trumpets have already occurred before</text>
  <text start="569.97" dur="3.45">the Great Tribulation even begins that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="571.5" dur="4.11">why there is a what&amp;#39;s known as a false</text>
  <text start="573.42" dur="3.39">Armageddon there&amp;#39;s gonna be a fall storm</text>
  <text start="575.61" dur="3.57">again that occurs and I&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="576.81" dur="4.41">this that for instance if the Great</text>
  <text start="579.18" dur="4.47">Tribulation were to begin next early</text>
  <text start="581.22" dur="4.17">March on Purim there are major events</text>
  <text start="583.65" dur="3.51">that have to occur over these next well</text>
  <text start="585.39" dur="3.72">December generate over these next three</text>
  <text start="587.16" dur="4.2">months the United States would have to</text>
  <text start="589.11" dur="3.45">be removed as a superpower Russia and</text>
  <text start="591.36" dur="2.69">China would have to destroy the United</text>
  <text start="592.56" dur="4.29">States which would be the second seal</text>
  <text start="594.05" dur="4.54">communism then you quickly see the third</text>
  <text start="596.85" dur="4.56">fourth and fifth seal happen total</text>
  <text start="598.59" dur="5.1">global economic collapse famine</text>
  <text start="601.41" dur="4.67">pestilence as a result of this nuclear</text>
  <text start="603.69" dur="4.92">war that would decimate 1/4 the earth</text>
  <text start="606.08" dur="4.69">thus martyrs in heaven crying out and</text>
  <text start="608.61" dur="4.05">God&amp;#39;s saying well they&amp;#39;re still yet more</text>
  <text start="610.77" dur="2.97">martyrs that need to join you because</text>
  <text start="612.66" dur="3.42">that time of the martyrs will come with</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="4.02">the son of perdition and and then the</text>
  <text start="616.08" dur="3.66">first four trumpets which basically</text>
  <text start="617.76" dur="4.62">describe the effects of a global</text>
  <text start="619.74" dur="4.83">thermonuclear war all those things have</text>
  <text start="622.38" dur="4.35">to occur which is basically gonna feel</text>
  <text start="624.57" dur="5.37">like an Armageddon all those things have</text>
  <text start="626.73" dur="4.56">to occur between now and next March if</text>
  <text start="629.94" dur="4.68">the Great Tribulation should begin next</text>
  <text start="631.29" dur="6.33">March also you you&amp;#39;d have Israel emerge</text>
  <text start="634.62" dur="5.25">as a superpower she would defeat her</text>
  <text start="637.62" dur="3.93">enemies or defeat them at least insofar</text>
  <text start="639.87" dur="3.96">that she would be able to have a temple</text>
  <text start="641.55" dur="3.9">or an altar on the Temple Mount and she</text>
  <text start="643.83" dur="3.63">would begin animal sacrifices over these</text>
  <text start="645.45" dur="4.05">next three months so all of that would</text>
  <text start="647.46" dur="3.39">have to occur before you get to the</text>
  <text start="649.5" dur="4.02">beginning of the Great Tribulation so</text>
  <text start="650.85" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s important to understand I believe</text>
  <text start="653.52" dur="3.06">the first seal the white horse has</text>
  <text start="655.38" dur="3.42">already been broken I think it was</text>
  <text start="656.58" dur="2.85">broken back when the United Nations came</text>
  <text start="658.8" dur="2.19">to power</text>
  <text start="659.43" dur="5.16">I think it&amp;#39;s false religion and false</text>
  <text start="660.99" dur="6.27">power a false unity I think Trump really</text>
  <text start="664.59" dur="4.68">fyz the white horse he&amp;#39;s even known as</text>
  <text start="667.26" dur="3.48">like a white nationalist kind of but I</text>
  <text start="669.27" dur="3.72">think that white horse has already been</text>
  <text start="670.74" dur="3.42">gone forth so I think the first seal is</text>
  <text start="672.99" dur="4.11">already broken and I think we&amp;#39;re ready</text>
  <text start="674.16" dur="4.23">for the second seal which is red which</text>
  <text start="677.1" dur="3.69">is the Communist war in which the</text>
  <text start="678.39" dur="3.81">Communists are ordained to destroy the</text>
  <text start="680.79" dur="3">United States which Dimitra do them in</text>
  <text start="682.2" dur="3.36">and Henry Gruver have prophesied about</text>
  <text start="683.79" dur="3.12">so I think we&amp;#39;re on the verge of that</text>
  <text start="685.56" dur="3.69">happening with what we&amp;#39;re seeing with my</text>
  <text start="686.91" dur="5.1">mr North Korea the rumblings in the</text>
  <text start="689.25" dur="5.43">Middle East with the Iranian naval ships</text>
  <text start="692.01" dur="4.74">in our Gulf and with Russian and Chinese</text>
  <text start="694.68" dur="3.21">nuclear submarines along both our coasts</text>
  <text start="696.75" dur="3.24">I think we&amp;#39;re on the verge of that</text>
  <text start="697.89" dur="3.84">second seal and again when that second</text>
  <text start="699.99" dur="3.24">seal happens it will mean the</text>
  <text start="701.73" dur="3.3">destruction the United States that will</text>
  <text start="703.23" dur="3.87">mean Russia and China will win but</text>
  <text start="705.03" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;ll be hit pretty badly it will mean</text>
  <text start="707.1" dur="4.65">a complete disruption of the global way</text>
  <text start="709.47" dur="3.99">as it is when we mean quickly a global</text>
  <text start="711.75" dur="3.69">collapse the third seal the four sealed</text>
  <text start="713.46" dur="5.84">with the seal and basically you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="715.44" dur="6.21">to have seven nations emerge and Israel</text>
  <text start="719.3" dur="3.61">will be the eight that will rule over</text>
  <text start="721.65" dur="3.75">them all with the son of perdition out</text>
  <text start="722.91" dur="4.08">of the ashes of that global war the</text>
  <text start="725.4" dur="4.08">first four trumpets and the first five</text>
  <text start="726.99" dur="3.9">seals the son of perdition comes and the</text>
  <text start="729.48" dur="3.48">son of perdition comes with the sixth</text>
  <text start="730.89" dur="5.94">seal and the fifth trumpet and this is a</text>
  <text start="732.96" dur="7.14">counterfeit return it&amp;#39;s gonna look like</text>
  <text start="736.83" dur="5.31">an actual second coming of Yahshua but</text>
  <text start="740.1" dur="4.65">it will be counterfeit and out of the</text>
  <text start="742.14" dur="4.86">ashes and war of that World War three</text>
  <text start="744.75" dur="3.99">you&amp;#39;re gonna have the counterfeit come</text>
  <text start="747" dur="4.5">back who I believe is gonna be Judas</text>
  <text start="748.74" dur="4.53">Iscariot resurrected but we&amp;#39;ll see but</text>
  <text start="751.5" dur="5.49">Satan will possess that man and so the</text>
  <text start="753.27" dur="5.55">the the 1290 days the 1260 well the 1290</text>
  <text start="756.99" dur="5.19">days basically then begins soon</text>
  <text start="758.82" dur="6.45">thereafter so that&amp;#39;s what happens on on</text>
  <text start="762.18" dur="4.5">perm okay and then if it were to happen</text>
  <text start="765.27" dur="2.67">this next year we&amp;#39;re actually have an</text>
  <text start="766.68" dur="3.81">eight-hour bet which means we have to</text>
  <text start="767.94" dur="4.17">add a thirteenth month into the year to</text>
  <text start="770.49" dur="3.26">make sure that Passover and Sukkot stay</text>
  <text start="772.11" dur="3.66">in their proper seasons and</text>
  <text start="773.75" dur="3.85">unfortunately it doesn&amp;#39;t look like the</text>
  <text start="775.77" dur="2.94">Jews who they follow a pre-calculated</text>
  <text start="777.6" dur="2.37">Hillel counter it doesn&amp;#39;t look like</text>
  <text start="778.71" dur="2.22">they&amp;#39;ve put in an eight-hour bet which</text>
  <text start="779.97" dur="3.66">means they&amp;#39;re gonna be keeping their</text>
  <text start="780.93" dur="8.43">feasts a month too early so while we</text>
  <text start="783.63" dur="8.7">have a 13th month going forth in the</text>
  <text start="789.36" dur="4.23">remainder of March of 2018 the Jews will</text>
  <text start="792.33" dur="3.48">begin to stall break their feasts a</text>
  <text start="793.59" dur="3.619">month too early and so I believe on the</text>
  <text start="795.81" dur="3.499">false lamb day</text>
  <text start="797.209" dur="5.67">which happens in late March I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="799.309" dur="7.47">like March 26 that&amp;#39;s when the 1290 days</text>
  <text start="802.879" dur="8.43">begin okay this is when the abomination</text>
  <text start="806.779" dur="7.081">of desolation happens so it&amp;#39;s been about</text>
  <text start="811.309" dur="4.291">a few weeks since he comes on the scene</text>
  <text start="813.86" dur="3.029">we know he&amp;#39;s gonna come on with</text>
  <text start="815.6" dur="2.669">flatteries at first he&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="816.889" dur="2.94">rejected and he&amp;#39;s gonna come on the</text>
  <text start="818.269" dur="3.81">scene with a small people but he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="819.829" dur="3.54">quickly gain notoriety he&amp;#39;s gonna call</text>
  <text start="822.079" dur="2.79">fire down from the sky he&amp;#39;s gonna do</text>
  <text start="823.369" dur="3.45">miracles signs and wonders the whole</text>
  <text start="824.869" dur="3.15">world is gonna wonder after him and he</text>
  <text start="826.819" dur="2.37">is going to commit the abomination of</text>
  <text start="828.019" dur="2.49">desolation because he&amp;#39;s going to step</text>
  <text start="829.189" dur="3.361">into the temple where there&amp;#39;s animals</text>
  <text start="830.509" dur="3.781">sacrificing to say hey we don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="832.55" dur="4.349">do these animal sacrifices you can just</text>
  <text start="834.29" dur="3.659">worship me okay and then that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="836.899" dur="1.44">people are gonna know we&amp;#39;re in big</text>
  <text start="837.949" dur="2.73">trouble</text>
  <text start="838.339" dur="3.901">so that I believe would happen if it</text>
  <text start="840.679" dur="3.361">were happened this next year it happened</text>
  <text start="842.24" dur="4.019">on landing which i think is the end of</text>
  <text start="844.04" dur="5.099">March the false the counterfeit lamb</text>
