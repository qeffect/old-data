  <text start="122.52" dur="5.67">before we kind of get into what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="125.07" dur="5.159">on how did you just so our audience kind</text>
  <text start="128.19" dur="3.72">of understands how did you first of all</text>
  <text start="130.229" dur="3.361">come to know the Lord and then second of</text>
  <text start="131.91" dur="6.18">all how did you get into doing</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="6.899">this sure yeah so I was raised in a sort</text>
  <text start="138.09" dur="4.979">of a non-denominational charismatic</text>
  <text start="140.489" dur="4.591">Christian Church down in Texas and it</text>
  <text start="143.069" dur="3.871">was kind of a thing where everyone down</text>
  <text start="145.08" dur="3.6">south is a Christian right so it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="146.94" dur="4.59">of like a cultural thing sort of hanging</text>
  <text start="148.68" dur="5.82">on my my parents coattails but when I</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="5.13">was 18 years old shortly after I had</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="4.47">graduated from high school there was</text>
  <text start="156.66" dur="4.98">this fiery evangelist he did open-air</text>
  <text start="158.97" dur="5.129">preaching on on college campuses anyway</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="4.65">he had come to our church and he started</text>
  <text start="164.099" dur="4.47">preaching this message of just get the</text>
  <text start="166.29" dur="4.62">sin out get the sin out of your life and</text>
  <text start="168.569" dur="5.311">and stuff I never really even heard</text>
  <text start="170.91" dur="5.549">before just that really really hit me</text>
  <text start="173.88" dur="4.169">hard showing me that uh yeah maybe I</text>
  <text start="176.459" dur="3.931">went to church maybe I called myself a</text>
  <text start="178.049" dur="4.561">Christian but I wasn&amp;#39;t really living the</text>
  <text start="180.39" dur="4.95">life and so it hit me hard it kind of</text>
  <text start="182.61" dur="4.379">showed me that I wasn&amp;#39;t really truly in</text>
  <text start="185.34" dur="7.02">love with the Messiah like I should be</text>
  <text start="186.989" dur="7.921">and so then on September 30th 1997 I was</text>
  <text start="192.36" dur="4.29">sitting under a tree I was working for a</text>
  <text start="194.91" dur="3.84">job that I&amp;#39;d gotten out of high school</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="4.32">and I was sitting under a tree on my</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="4.799">lunch break and I was reading the verse</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="4.769">in Philippians and it said to live is</text>
  <text start="203.549" dur="5.22">Christ and to die is gain and when I</text>
  <text start="205.739" dur="5.28">read those words to live as Christ that</text>
  <text start="208.769" dur="4.921">part of the scripture just like burn</text>
  <text start="211.019" dur="5.55">like fire in my mind and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="213.69" dur="6.18">I realized it was Messiah living in me</text>
  <text start="216.569" dur="4.92">that enables me to overcome sin it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="219.87" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s not anything within me that I can</text>
  <text start="221.489" dur="4.951">do it on my own and as soon as I had</text>
  <text start="223.23" dur="5.369">this revelation and I he became so real</text>
  <text start="226.44" dur="4.229">to me so real not just something that I</text>
  <text start="228.599" dur="4.95">had been taught growing up and this</text>
  <text start="230.669" dur="4.531">cloud just lifted off of me and so our</text>
  <text start="233.549" dur="2.94">church was having revival meetings at</text>
  <text start="235.2" dur="3.119">this point we were like meeting every</text>
  <text start="236.489" dur="3.421">single night because of this evangelist</text>
  <text start="238.319" dur="3.301">that had come and so when I went that</text>
  <text start="239.91" dur="4.049">night people looked at me who had known</text>
  <text start="241.62" dur="4.08">me for years and they said wow you look</text>
  <text start="243.959" dur="4.231">you look so different your countenance</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="5.399">is so much brighter and it&amp;#39;s yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="248.19" dur="4.74">because I got what I can amen</text>
  <text start="251.099" dur="4.32">yeah man shortly after that about a year</text>
  <text start="252.93" dur="4.95">later I moved up to Oregon for school</text>
  <text start="255.419" dur="4.051">and I lived in Oregon for about twenty</text>
  <text start="257.88" dur="3.69">years but I went up there for school and</text>
  <text start="259.47" dur="3.33">I was actually doing some open-air</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="4.76">street preaching at Portland State</text>
  <text start="262.8" dur="5.75">University a couple years later</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="4.53">and there was a there was a Messianic</text>
  <text start="268.55" dur="4.859">Jew who was a student in the crowd and</text>
  <text start="270.86" dur="4.649">he he came up to me after my preaching</text>
  <text start="273.409" dur="3.391">he said hey I really enjoyed your</text>
  <text start="275.509" dur="3.301">preaching and I&amp;#39;d love to invite you to</text>
  <text start="276.8" dur="5.19">this Messianic Jewish congregation that</text>
  <text start="278.81" dur="4.859">we have and I was like well okay that</text>
  <text start="281.99" dur="4.739">sounds kind of interesting I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="283.669" dur="4.53">Christians meet on Sundays and and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.729" dur="3.481">like well we meet on Saturday but just</text>
  <text start="288.199" dur="4.351">just check it out and I was like okay so</text>
  <text start="290.21" dur="4.59">I go to this congregation and this</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="5.76">messianic congregation and I walk in and</text>
  <text start="294.8" dur="5.13">I see this pastor with this long horn I</text>
  <text start="298.31" dur="3.96">had no idea what it was I later learned</text>
  <text start="299.93" dur="4.949">it was a shofar I saw all these people</text>
  <text start="302.27" dur="4.56">doing this Hebrew dancing the the women</text>
  <text start="304.879" dur="5.371">were wearing these long colorful veils</text>
  <text start="306.83" dur="4.44">the music it wasn&amp;#39;t the major chords</text>
  <text start="310.25" dur="3.449">that you hear in a lot of Christian</text>
  <text start="311.27" dur="5.76">churches it was more of the minor chords</text>
  <text start="313.699" dur="5.52">and there was a violins and it just it</text>
  <text start="317.03" dur="4.319">like pierced my heart and and when I</text>
  <text start="319.219" dur="3.871">walked into this I was like I have never</text>
  <text start="321.349" dur="3.87">seen anything like this in the church</text>
  <text start="323.09" dur="3.569">world even though I was raised in the</text>
  <text start="325.219" dur="3.6">church I mean I went to all different</text>
  <text start="326.659" dur="5.25">types of churches I never saw this and</text>
  <text start="328.819" dur="6.391">it just it just drew me it drew me and</text>
  <text start="331.909" dur="5.671">and when I began to explore the Masonic</text>
  <text start="335.21" dur="3.78">Hebrew roots of the Christian faith it</text>
  <text start="337.58" dur="3.269">was like the Christianity that I had</text>
  <text start="338.99" dur="4.2">known was sort of like a happy meal of</text>
  <text start="340.849" dur="4.171">McDonald&amp;#39;s but the but the Messianic</text>
  <text start="343.19" dur="4.62">Hebrew roots of the Christian faith like</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="5.22">the seven-course meal so it just it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.81" dur="4.62">just so much more drew me closer to</text>
  <text start="350.24" dur="4.919">Messiah I almost felt like I was being</text>
  <text start="352.43" dur="5.789">born again again for the second time</text>
  <text start="355.159" dur="5.76">those are the two points in my life that</text>
  <text start="358.219" dur="5.461">really really brought me to the Messiah</text>
  <text start="360.919" dur="5.06">you know we have a Mike and I have had a</text>
  <text start="363.68" dur="5">similar experience in the sense of</text>
  <text start="365.979" dur="5.171">exploring the Hebrew root side of things</text>
  <text start="368.68" dur="4.87">there is nothing like hearing that</text>
  <text start="371.15" dur="5.37">shofar below for the first time there is</text>
  <text start="373.55" dur="5.25">absolutely nothing like it the way I</text>
  <text start="376.52" dur="5.04">tend to describe it you know I would not</text>
  <text start="378.8" dur="4.229">consider myself like fully how do I put</text>
  <text start="381.56" dur="3.63">this like you know we&amp;#39;re kind of I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="383.029" dur="4.89">kind of exploring things but the way I</text>
  <text start="385.19" dur="5.52">like to describe it is it&amp;#39;s kind of like</text>
  <text start="387.919" dur="6.12">sitting down to a full-on steak when you</text>
  <text start="390.71" dur="6.35">start really examining the roots of the</text>
  <text start="394.039" dur="4.831">faith one example I always like to tell</text>
  <text start="397.06" dur="2.6">Christians who are just sort of maybe</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="3.58">new to this</text>
  <text start="399.66" dur="4.44">say well you know I was raised in my</text>
  <text start="402.45" dur="4.53">nondenominational church doing Easter</text>
  <text start="404.1" dur="5.64">but when I started doing Passover and</text>
  <text start="406.98" dur="4.77">unleavened bread and first fruits those</text>
  <text start="409.74" dur="4.65">Hebrew feasts that are in the scriptures</text>
  <text start="411.75" dur="5.7">that Jesus himself observed they paint</text>
  <text start="414.39" dur="6.06">such a more vivid picture of the death</text>
  <text start="417.45" dur="4.62">burial and resurrection of Messiah then</text>
  <text start="420.45" dur="4.44">you know the Easter sonrise morning</text>
  <text start="422.07" dur="6.42">service ever did and that&amp;#39;s just one</text>
  <text start="424.89" dur="6.12">example of how how returning to the</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="5.61">Torah the Hebrew roots really brings you</text>
  <text start="431.01" dur="5.01">closer to this Messiah how does that</text>
  <text start="434.1" dur="5.67">lead to you suddenly doing a YouTube</text>
  <text start="436.02" dur="6.33">channel and investigating pedophilia and</text>
  <text start="439.77" dur="4.14">satanic ritual abuse when I first got</text>
  <text start="442.35" dur="4.17">into the Hebrew Jewish roots I mean this</text>
  <text start="443.91" dur="5.61">is way back in in 2001 and then I</text>
  <text start="446.52" dur="4.92">started a YouTube channel in 2007 and</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="4.8">pretty much the YouTube channel was</text>
  <text start="451.44" dur="4.11">about that teaching Christians about the</text>
  <text start="454.32" dur="3.72">Hebrew Jewish roots of the Christian</text>
  <text start="455.55" dur="4.44">faith and so for for many many years</text>
  <text start="458.04" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s pretty much all I was doing I</text>
  <text start="459.99" dur="3.81">would do evangelism and preaching and</text>
  <text start="461.82" dur="6.84">Bible studies and things like that and</text>
  <text start="463.8" dur="7.02">so from 2007 all the way until 2018 in</text>
  <text start="468.66" dur="4.23">that time period I had about 20 I built</text>
  <text start="470.82" dur="4.65">up to about 2500 subscribers that was</text>
  <text start="472.89" dur="5.58">about it and was just doing doing what I</text>
  <text start="475.47" dur="6.84">would I just mentioned but in July of</text>
  <text start="478.47" dur="6.92">2018 I had moved up here to Alaska I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="482.31" dur="5.91">been living here for a while and and I</text>
  <text start="485.39" dur="5.74">was working here in Alaska and I started</text>
  <text start="488.22" dur="5.07">listening to people like Isaac Cathy who</text>
  <text start="491.13" dur="5.16">first came out to sort of expose a lot</text>
  <text start="493.29" dur="5.1">of the some big names in Hollywood that</text>
  <text start="496.29" dur="3.9">were satanic pedophiles and through</text>
  <text start="498.39" dur="5.19">Isaac at me I learned about Fiona</text>
  <text start="500.19" dur="5.82">Barnett and Fiona Barnett for those who</text>
  <text start="503.58" dur="5.1">may not know she is someone that is from</text>
  <text start="506.01" dur="6.24">Australia and for many many decades</text>
  <text start="508.68" dur="5.34">she&amp;#39;s come out about her abuse when she</text>
  <text start="512.25" dur="4.229">was a little girl and she was abused by</text>
  <text start="514.02" dur="4.32">a lot of big-name people people like</text>
  <text start="516.479" dur="4.711">that will even shock you like Billy</text>
  <text start="518.34" dur="4.98">Graham Richard Nixon Meryl Streep from</text>
  <text start="521.19" dur="3.84">Hollywood and and she would name these</text>
  <text start="523.32" dur="3.33">people and her testimony was just</text>
  <text start="525.03" dur="4.2">unchanged for decades and I started</text>
  <text start="526.65" dur="5.4">listening to interviews of her and I I</text>
  <text start="529.23" dur="4.359">just knew I knew that she was she was</text>
  <text start="532.05" dur="3.22">telling the truth</text>
  <text start="533.589" dur="5.041">and so as I started listening to her and</text>
  <text start="535.27" dur="4.98">others I was like wow this is this is a</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="3.33">topic that I really didn&amp;#39;t know much</text>
  <text start="540.25" dur="3.45">about I mean of course I&amp;#39;ve always known</text>
  <text start="541.96" dur="4.92">that there was problems name of</text>
  <text start="543.7" dur="5.43">pedophilia but I didn&amp;#39;t fully grasp how</text>
  <text start="546.88" dur="4.95">pervasive it was and and the whole</text>
  <text start="549.13" dur="4.59">satanic ritual aspect that&amp;#39;s connected</text>
  <text start="551.83" dur="4.59">to it the Lord spoke to me and said</text>
  <text start="553.72" dur="5.58">Daniel I want you from this point on</text>
  <text start="556.42" dur="6.18">this was on July 31st of last year I</text>
  <text start="559.3" dur="6.27">want you to use your platform to to</text>
  <text start="562.6" dur="4.26">expose the step to expose this pedophile</text>
  <text start="565.57" dur="3.36">the child sex trafficking human</text>
  <text start="566.86" dur="5.07">trafficking to be a voice for the</text>
  <text start="568.93" dur="4.2">voiceless I want you to do this and when</text>
  <text start="571.93" dur="3.24">when he told me to do it</text>
  <text start="573.13" dur="3.6">I honestly thought okay this will be</text>
  <text start="575.17" dur="3.21">something I&amp;#39;ll do you know for a few</text>
  <text start="576.73" dur="3.6">weeks that I&amp;#39;ll add on to what I</text>
  <text start="578.38" dur="3.3">normally do about you know teaching</text>
  <text start="580.33" dur="2.73">Christians about the Hebrew roots the</text>

  <text start="583.06" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s honestly I thought was</text>
  <text start="584.35" dur="5.4">gonna happen it very quickly grew to</text>
  <text start="586.81" dur="4.46">where you know yah was guiding me to</text>
  <text start="589.75" dur="3.57">people that I was starting to interview</text>

  <text start="610.69" dur="5.04">subscribers and that&amp;#39;s how quickly</text>
  <text start="613.029" dur="6.321">things great I am surprised that YouTube</text>
  <text start="615.73" dur="7.17">has allowed that to happen considering</text>
  <text start="619.35" dur="6.429">they are known for trying to shut down</text>
  <text start="622.9" dur="5.129">anyone that touches this topic so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="625.779" dur="6.451">a very very good point you bring up so</text>
  <text start="628.029" dur="7.831">about 2 or 3 months into doing this so</text>

  <text start="640.63" dur="5.7">prayer group and and we we started it</text>
  <text start="643.029" dur="5.371">off just to pray for the nation pray for</text>
  <text start="646.33" dur="3.93">President Trump but also to pray for my</text>
  <text start="648.4" dur="3.96">YouTube platform and back then I only</text>
  <text start="650.26" dur="4.17">had maybe fifteen twenty thousand</text>
  <text start="652.36" dur="4.02">subscribers at that point but we started</text>
  <text start="654.43" dur="4.83">praying and praying and praying and we</text>
  <text start="656.38" dur="4.98">meet now every single night John</text>
  <text start="659.26" dur="4.53">actually met with me when I traveled out</text>
  <text start="661.36" dur="3.84">to the White House in November where I I</text>
  <text start="663.79" dur="2.29">preached in front of the White House to</text>
  <text start="665.2" dur="3.22">bring awareness</text>
  <text start="666.08" dur="4.319">of the child sex trafficking and satanic</text>
  <text start="668.42" dur="3.81">ritual abuse and also to encourage</text>
  <text start="670.399" dur="5.371">President Trump to continue to go after</text>
  <text start="672.23" dur="5.85">these people but John mint met with me</text>
  <text start="675.77" dur="3.87">there and when we met in person there</text>
  <text start="678.08" dur="3.87">and the week we just started this prayer</text>
  <text start="679.64" dur="4.139">meeting and literally every single night</text>
  <text start="681.95" dur="3.72">we meet two and one of the things we</text>
  <text start="683.779" dur="3.721">specifically pray over is my youtube</text>
  <text start="685.67" dur="4.47">channel and the social media platform</text>
  <text start="687.5" dur="7.2">that it will be protected and so far so</text>
  <text start="690.14" dur="6.6">far has been in general terms what is</text>
  <text start="694.7" dur="4.05">satanic ritual abuse and how is it</text>
  <text start="696.74" dur="4.289">different than different than just</text>
  <text start="698.75" dur="4.74">regular run-of-the-mill child abuse</text>
  <text start="701.029" dur="5.011">which in itself is evil but how is it</text>
  <text start="703.49" dur="4.469">different right yeah and and just so</text>
  <text start="706.04" dur="3.78">before I answer that question just</text>
  <text start="707.959" dur="3.961">preface that by saying I I do believe</text>
  <text start="709.82" dur="4.8">all pedophilia is satanic</text>
  <text start="711.92" dur="5.669">because they do this to a little child</text>
  <text start="714.62" dur="5.52">is completely following Satan&amp;#39;s agenda I</text>
  <text start="717.589" dur="5.611">agree with that completely yeah</text>
  <text start="720.14" dur="5.73">so thus a satanic ritual abuse aspect of</text>
  <text start="723.2" dur="5.25">this is that not only is is the</text>
  <text start="725.87" dur="4.65">pedophilia being done on on the wheat</text>
  <text start="728.45" dur="5.19">the child but they&amp;#39;re actually being</text>
  <text start="730.52" dur="6.45">used in a satanic ritual abuse type of</text>
  <text start="733.64" dur="4.92">situation where these people these evil</text>
  <text start="736.97" dur="3.929">people who are doing this to these small</text>
  <text start="738.56" dur="5.73">children actually believe that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="740.899" dur="4.981">getting a special power I guess you</text>
  <text start="744.29" dur="4.109">would be like a counterfeit anointing</text>
  <text start="745.88" dur="6.03">really because they believe that by</text>
  <text start="748.399" dur="5.731">taking ruining what is most innocent and</text>
  <text start="751.91" dur="4.77">what is most defenseless that that will</text>
  <text start="754.13" dur="5.34">give it&amp;#39;s very sick actually but that</text>
  <text start="756.68" dur="5.55">will give them power and so and so they</text>
  <text start="759.47" dur="4.92">will do this the people who are able to</text>
  <text start="762.23" dur="2.94">survive it they were sexually molested</text>
  <text start="764.39" dur="3.03">those who did not</text>
  <text start="765.17" dur="4.74">these people were sexually molested they</text>
  <text start="767.42" dur="3.93">were in some cases as hard as this</text>
  <text start="769.91" dur="4.71">system believes they were cannibalized</text>
  <text start="771.35" dur="5.94">I&amp;#39;ve actually talked with if people will</text>
  <text start="774.62" dur="5.79">watch my interview with Aaron gola which</text>
  <text start="777.29" dur="7.02">I did last October you know he he saw</text>
  <text start="780.41" dur="6.9">Hillary Clinton cannibalizing babies he</text>
  <text start="784.31" dur="4.5">saw this with his own ax and these were</text>
  <text start="787.31" dur="4.11">we were in tunnels that were beneath</text>
  <text start="788.81" dur="5.37">Washington DC and you can watch those</text>
  <text start="791.42" dur="4.74">interviews and and but but yeah this is</text>
  <text start="794.18" dur="2.84">very horrific stuff it&amp;#39;s almost to the</text>
  <text start="796.16" dur="2.989">point where and</text>
  <text start="797.02" dur="4.98">and Aaron himself makes this point you</text>
  <text start="799.149" dur="4.56">know our brains aren&amp;#39;t designed by God</text>
  <text start="802" dur="5.12">to be able to process this type of stuff</text>
  <text start="803.709" dur="6.69">because it&amp;#39;s so horrific it&amp;#39;s so gross</text>
  <text start="807.12" dur="5.469">but but like you said it&amp;#39;s like we have</text>
  <text start="810.399" dur="4.891">to we have to shine a spotlight on this</text>
  <text start="812.589" dur="5.551">stuff and expose it make people aware so</text>
  <text start="815.29" dur="4.68">that people can be aware enough to say</text>
  <text start="818.14" dur="3.21">this has got to stop we can&amp;#39;t continue</text>
  <text start="819.97" dur="4.59">to live in a nation where we have</text>
  <text start="821.35" dur="5.31">leaders in Hollywood and in politics and</text>
  <text start="824.56" dur="4.5">CEOs and powerful people all across our</text>
  <text start="826.66" dur="4.47">nation that are doing this stuff we</text>
  <text start="829.06" dur="4.74">can&amp;#39;t accept it and so that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="831.13" dur="6.54">primary focuses of my youtube-channel</text>
  <text start="833.8" dur="6.289">laws is to just raise this awareness you</text>
  <text start="837.67" dur="6.09">know you hear something like that and</text>
  <text start="840.089" dur="6.221">most people&amp;#39;s first reaction is okay</text>
  <text start="843.76" dur="4.92">come on you&amp;#39;ve been watching conspiracy</text>
  <text start="846.31" dur="3.719">theory stuff right I mean because this</text>
  <text start="848.68" dur="3.9">is not something that the mainstream</text>
  <text start="850.029" dur="4.231">church will talk about because they</text>
  <text start="852.58" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s real well and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="854.26" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s even worse than that not only do</text>
  <text start="856.36" dur="4.44">they not believe it&amp;#39;s what real but in</text>
  <text start="858.25" dur="5.97">some cases they&amp;#39;re actually part of the</text>
  <text start="860.8" dur="4.77">problem I&amp;#39;ve actually interviewed one</text>
  <text start="864.22" dur="3.239">lady who she didn&amp;#39;t want to come on</text>
  <text start="865.57" dur="3.87">camera but I got the information from</text>
  <text start="867.459" dur="4.041">her and it was substantiated by other</text>
  <text start="869.44" dur="4.29">witnesses as well that implicated</text>
  <text start="871.5" dur="5.5">Kenneth Copeland and the Word of Faith</text>
  <text start="873.73" dur="6.75">Ministries and being involved in satanic</text>
  <text start="877" dur="6.57">pedophilia cannibalism ritual abuse in</text>
  <text start="880.48" dur="4.71">tunnels beneath Oral Roberts itself now</text>
  <text start="883.57" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;re right a lot of people will</text>
  <text start="885.19" dur="4.44">initially react to this stuff and say</text>
  <text start="886.81" dur="5.37">well this cannot be true if you go on my</text>
  <text start="889.63" dur="5.16">youtube channel just since last July and</text>
  <text start="892.18" dur="3.54">you start listening to one interview</text>
  <text start="894.79" dur="4.71">after another</text>
  <text start="895.72" dur="5.46">Aaron Golub Amy Berger David sugar you</text>
  <text start="899.5" dur="3.87">start hearing me report about Fiona</text>
  <text start="901.18" dur="4.23">Barnett you start seeing all these</text>
  <text start="903.37" dur="4.86">people that I&amp;#39;ve interviewed there</text>
  <text start="905.41" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s a term in in our court system</text>
  <text start="908.23" dur="5.099">known as a preponderance of evidence and</text>
  <text start="910.36" dur="4.77">and what you will see is that these</text>
  <text start="913.329" dur="3.721">stories from people from all different</text>
  <text start="915.13" dur="4.199">types of backgrounds all different types</text>
  <text start="917.05" dur="4.74">of ages they don&amp;#39;t even know each other</text>
  <text start="919.329" dur="5.771">in many cases and yet their testimonies</text>
  <text start="921.79" dur="5.38">are very similar and what they undergo</text>
  <text start="925.1" dur="6.57">and their testimonies have remained</text>
  <text start="927.17" dur="6.78">unchanged for years and so if you begin</text>
  <text start="931.67" dur="4.26">to realize gosh this isn&amp;#39;t science</text>
  <text start="933.95" dur="5.73">fiction this isn&amp;#39;t some horror flick</text>
  <text start="935.93" dur="5.7">this is real this is real and and and</text>
  <text start="939.68" dur="4.55">also the other point I want to make is a</text>
  <text start="941.63" dur="5.73">lot of these survivors they have no</text>
  <text start="944.23" dur="4.12">motivation to lie because they they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="947.36" dur="2.94">not getting first of all they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="948.35" dur="3.99">making any money off of it second of all</text>
  <text start="950.3" dur="4.56">they oftentimes get harassed and</text>
  <text start="952.34" dur="4.47">vilified for coming out and speaking out</text>
  <text start="954.86" dur="4.2">about this stuff so if anything they</text>
  <text start="956.81" dur="6.06">have a motivation not to speak out about</text>
  <text start="959.06" dur="5.85">this at all so so you just you take the</text>
  <text start="962.87" dur="5.07">totality of the evidence and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="964.91" dur="5.34">going on and and you begin to realize oh</text>
  <text start="967.94" dur="6.53">my goodness this is a problem it is</text>
  <text start="970.25" dur="7.62">pervasive and it does need to be exposed</text>
  <text start="974.47" dur="5.92">now you also reference and a lot of your</text>
  <text start="977.87" dur="6.48">interviews on the channel of these</text>
  <text start="980.39" dur="5.58">people something called MKULTRA can you</text>
  <text start="984.35" dur="3.3">kind of go into that and explain a</text>
  <text start="985.97" dur="4.08">little bit how that plays into this as</text>
  <text start="987.65" dur="3.93">well yeah so yeah I&amp;#39;m Fiona Barnett by</text>
  <text start="990.05" dur="3.72">the way talks a lot about this on her</text>
  <text start="991.58" dur="4.44">website and then when I interviewed</text>
  <text start="993.77" dur="4.26">especially Aaron Golub and David sugar</text>
  <text start="996.02" dur="4.2">they both talked about this quite</text>
  <text start="998.03" dur="5.52">extensively as well but you know the</text>
  <text start="1000.22" dur="6.15">MKULTRA is the mind control program so</text>
  <text start="1003.55" dur="4.56">this is where and when they start this</text>
  <text start="1006.37" dur="4.02">abuse on these little children it&amp;#39;s at a</text>
  <text start="1008.11" dur="4.32">very very young age it can be as young</text>
  <text start="1010.39" dur="4.5">as two years old in some cases as</text>
  <text start="1012.43" dur="4.5">horrific as that sounds that&amp;#39;s sick it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1014.89" dur="4.23">very sick but the reason they start that</text>
  <text start="1016.93" dur="4.35">young is they literally will try to</text>
  <text start="1019.12" dur="4.23">fragment a personality and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="1021.28" dur="4.86">MKULTRA comes in they literally try to</text>
  <text start="1023.35" dur="4.05">so shatter the personality with through</text>
  <text start="1026.14" dur="3.54">the sexual abuse and through the</text>
  <text start="1027.4" dur="3.9">mind-control that it almost causes them</text>
  <text start="1029.68" dur="4.529">to have you know different types of</text>
  <text start="1031.3" dur="6.36">personalities and and they do that to</text>
  <text start="1034.209" dur="5.071">not only control them and to try to you</text>
  <text start="1037.66" dur="4.86">know make sure they&amp;#39;re not gonna go rat</text>
  <text start="1039.28" dur="5.34">out on the the abusers but but then they</text>
  <text start="1042.52" dur="3.929">also do this because their hope is that</text>
  <text start="1044.62" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re gonna raise a generation of</text>
  <text start="1046.449" dur="5.041">people that will be just like them okay</text>
  <text start="1048.97" dur="4.26">and and in some cases they have been</text>
  <text start="1051.49" dur="3.18">successful and they&amp;#39;ll have these</text>
  <text start="1053.23" dur="3.63">different types of personalities where</text>
  <text start="1054.67" dur="3.78">they can act one way in public but then</text>
  <text start="1056.86" dur="4.35">another way they&amp;#39;re these horrible</text>
  <text start="1058.45" dur="6.39">where they&amp;#39;re out abusing these children</text>
  <text start="1061.21" dur="5.969">now people like Fiona Barnett David</text>
  <text start="1064.84" dur="5.519">sugar and Aaron gold they&amp;#39;ve been able</text>
  <text start="1067.179" dur="4.44">to break out of their NK mind control</text>
  <text start="1070.359" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;ve been able to break out of it a</text>
  <text start="1071.619" dur="2.28">lot and it&amp;#39;s been through the blood of</text>
  <text start="1073.269" dur="2.64">Messiah</text>
  <text start="1073.899" dur="3.931">I mean Fiona will will just tell you</text>
  <text start="1075.909" dur="4.681">that&amp;#39;s how it happened it was through</text>
  <text start="1077.83" dur="4.409">blood of Messiah and from his spirit</text>
  <text start="1080.59" dur="2.909">that brought healing and there were some</text>
  <text start="1082.239" dur="3.27">other things that she did as well but</text>
  <text start="1083.499" dur="3.9">that was the paramount paramount thing</text>
  <text start="1085.509" dur="4.35">that brought her out and David was</text>
  <text start="1087.399" dur="4.681">tested the same thing and in fact I</text>
  <text start="1089.859" dur="3.721">talked to one guy who he never wanted to</text>
  <text start="1092.08" dur="4.14">be interviewed but he talked about how</text>
  <text start="1093.58" dur="4.199">he underwent this mind control and</text>
  <text start="1096.22" dur="4.019">sexual abuse from a little as a little</text>
  <text start="1097.779" dur="4.5">boy but that what healed him was he just</text>
  <text start="1100.239" dur="5.43">kept listening to the Bible on audio</text>
  <text start="1102.279" dur="4.83">tape for months and years and years just</text>
  <text start="1105.669" dur="3.72">every evening he&amp;#39;d listened to it and</text>
  <text start="1107.109" dur="5.221">and it just gradually sort of healed him</text>
  <text start="1109.389" dur="4.701">but but yeah the MKULTRA program is a</text>
  <text start="1112.33" dur="4.559">program that was brought over by</text>
  <text start="1114.09" dur="4.149">Operation Paperclip which if your</text>
  <text start="1116.889" dur="3">audience isn&amp;#39;t familiar with that it</text>
  <text start="1118.239" dur="4.231">basically the you know a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1119.889" dur="4.711">Nazis rather than being charged and</text>
  <text start="1122.47" dur="3.689">executed like they should have been at</text>
  <text start="1124.6" dur="4.079">the Nuremberg trials were actually</text>
  <text start="1126.159" dur="5.671">brought over here to the United States</text>
  <text start="1128.679" dur="6.72">South America things like that and and</text>
  <text start="1131.83" dur="6.059">they worked with our CIA on this</text>
  <text start="1135.399" dur="5.22">Operation Paperclip which which you know</text>
  <text start="1137.889" dur="5.64">basically turning this MK ULTRA was one</text>
  <text start="1140.619" dur="5.821">of their programs to try to control</text>
  <text start="1143.529" dur="6.181">people and and they perpetrated this</text>
  <text start="1146.44" dur="5.189">upon many different individuals in the</text>
  <text start="1149.71" dur="5.01">United States and Australia and whatnot</text>
  <text start="1151.629" dur="4.74">and okay mind control of fragmenting the</text>
  <text start="1154.72" dur="4.11">personalities and controlling and</text>
  <text start="1156.369" dur="4.8">whatnot it was the tool the apparatus</text>
  <text start="1158.83" dur="6.15">they used in conjunction with this</text>

  <text start="1223.059" dur="5.25">of the themes that is actually brought</text>
  <text start="1224.77" dur="5.19">out is the promotion of MKULTRA because</text>
  <text start="1228.309" dur="5.161">one of the characters is literally</text>
  <text start="1229.96" dur="5.37">programmed literally fragmented and they</text>
  <text start="1233.47" dur="4.29">implant a personality on top of the guy</text>
  <text start="1235.33" dur="4.829">and I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s through horrific</text>
  <text start="1237.76" dur="4.95">torture and trauma it is one of the most</text>
  <text start="1240.159" dur="5.611">dark is one of the darker I mean I grew</text>
  <text start="1242.71" dur="5.88">up a Star Trek fan okay but this series</text>
  <text start="1245.77" dur="5.22">was one of the darkest series I had ever</text>
  <text start="1248.59" dur="4.5">seen in my life and I had to sit down</text>
  <text start="1250.99" dur="4.23">and I and I wasn&amp;#39;t even sure if I was</text>
  <text start="1253.09" dur="5.069">gonna finish it but the Lord was like no</text>
  <text start="1255.22" dur="4.589">exposed this and so that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1258.159" dur="4.14">been working on I&amp;#39;ve been working on</text>
  <text start="1259.809" dur="5.131">this article for a while now I&amp;#39;m hoping</text>
  <text start="1262.299" dur="4.38">to have it go live Friday it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1264.94" dur="3.989">interesting you bring up Star Trek and</text>
  <text start="1266.679" dur="3.931">Hollywood because that that is kind of</text>
  <text start="1268.929" dur="4.051">the issue that got me launched last</text>
  <text start="1270.61" dur="5.34">summer and and you know when I started</text>
  <text start="1272.98" dur="5.67">hearing things like Steven Spielberg and</text>
  <text start="1275.95" dur="5.219">Tom Hanks were satanic pedophiles it</text>
  <text start="1278.65" dur="3.99">initially just blew my mind because I</text>
  <text start="1281.169" dur="3.481">loved going to see a Steven Spielberg</text>
  <text start="1282.64" dur="5.49">movie are going to see a Tom Hanks movie</text>
  <text start="1284.65" dur="6.09">but in fact these people are pedophiles</text>
  <text start="1288.13" dur="5.94">and and it&amp;#39;s not just one person saying</text>
  <text start="1290.74" dur="4.71">it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s many many many many</text>
  <text start="1294.07" dur="3.51">different whistleblowers and people</text>
  <text start="1295.45" dur="4.32">saying look the evidence is overwhelming</text>
  <text start="1297.58" dur="4.5">here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1299.77" dur="5.58">that they&amp;#39;re not being held accountable</text>
  <text start="1302.08" dur="5.4">because they&amp;#39;re so wealthy they&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="1305.35" dur="4.53">rich they&amp;#39;re so powerful you can just</text>
  <text start="1307.48" dur="4.35">buy off the courts sure yeah they buy</text>
  <text start="1309.88" dur="4.08">off the courts they do what they want</text>
  <text start="1311.83" dur="4.74">but like in the case with with you know</text>
  <text start="1313.96" dur="4.89">Steven Spielberg the whole little girl</text>
  <text start="1316.57" dur="3.78">Heather O&amp;#39;Rourke who is in the</text>
  <text start="1318.85" dur="4.53">poltergeist movies back in the early</text>
  <text start="1320.35" dur="5.1">1980s she was actually raped and abused</text>
  <text start="1323.38" dur="2.82">by Steven Spielberg and and fellow</text>
  <text start="1325.45" dur="2.21">executives</text>
  <text start="1326.2" dur="4.68">that were working on that film in fact</text>
  <text start="1327.66" dur="6.73">Crispin Glover who is an a-class actor</text>
  <text start="1330.88" dur="6.24">he played the father of Marty McFly in</text>
  <text start="1334.39" dur="5.55">the first Back to the Future movie ever</text>
  <text start="1337.12" dur="6.6">actually wrote an essay and he talks</text>
  <text start="1339.94" dur="5.61">about Steven Spielberg being a pedophile</text>
  <text start="1343.72" dur="4.14">now Crispin Glover is not just gonna</text>
  <text start="1345.55" dur="4.53">make this stuff up okay you know he was</text>
  <text start="1347.86" dur="5.07">an a-class actor I had always wondered</text>
  <text start="1350.08" dur="4.89">why he never continued on in the Back to</text>
  <text start="1352.93" dur="3.51">the Future 2 in 3 movies we always</text>
  <text start="1354.97" dur="3.3">thought I was just he had a dispute with</text>
  <text start="1356.44" dur="3.81">with you know Robert Zemeckis or</text>
  <text start="1358.27" dur="3.81">whatever no it was because Steven</text>
  <text start="1360.25" dur="4.65">Spielberg was the executive producer on</text>
  <text start="1362.08" dur="4.35">those movies and Crispin Glover after</text>
  <text start="1364.9" dur="3.96">making the first fact that you maybe</text>
  <text start="1366.43" dur="5.19">found out about Steven Spielberg&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1368.86" dur="4.2">pedophilia and about how he hurts so</text>
  <text start="1371.62" dur="3.15">many little children including Heather</text>
  <text start="1373.06" dur="3.93">work and so he would have nothing more</text>
  <text start="1374.77" dur="4.2">to do with it so he backed out he he</text>
  <text start="1376.99" dur="5.01">wouldn&amp;#39;t and of course he later really</text>
  <text start="1378.97" dur="5.43">didn&amp;#39;t continue on much in the main</text>
  <text start="1382" dur="4.14">Hollywood stream either but he wrote a</text>
  <text start="1384.4" dur="3.36">very extensive essay that I actually</text>
  <text start="1386.14" dur="4.37">have linked up on one of my earlier</text>
  <text start="1387.76" dur="6.27">videos from all August that he wrote in</text>
  <text start="1390.51" dur="6.43">2003 and he pulls no punches</text>
  <text start="1394.03" dur="5.7">I mean he very clearly says that Steven</text>
  <text start="1396.94" dur="5.61">Spielberg is a is a pedophile if this is</text>
  <text start="1399.73" dur="4.47">true what is the church supposed to do</text>
  <text start="1402.55" dur="3.63">about it because the church doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1404.2" dur="3.72">know about a half of time what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1406.18" dur="4.2">trying to do and what I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="1407.92" dur="4.35">believers need to be doing is bringing</text>
  <text start="1410.38" dur="5.79">awareness of the subject to people</text>
  <text start="1412.27" dur="6.51">because first of all Messiah said very</text>
  <text start="1416.17" dur="7.05">clearly Jesus Yahshua said very clearly</text>
  <text start="1418.78" dur="6.24">in Luke 17 2 he said if anyone causes a</text>
  <text start="1423.22" dur="3.18">little one to stumble it&amp;#39;s better for</text>
  <text start="1425.02" dur="3.33">them to have a millstone tied around</text>
  <text start="1426.4" dur="4.38">their neck and to be cast into the sea</text>
  <text start="1428.35" dur="6.36">that was his solution for Satanic</text>
  <text start="1430.78" dur="6.39">pedophiles so if anyone should be at the</text>
  <text start="1434.71" dur="5.16">forefront of exposing this stuff and</text>
  <text start="1437.17" dur="4.98">bringing people on awareness and saying</text>
  <text start="1439.87" dur="3.69">hey we need to call our leaders to</text>
  <text start="1442.15" dur="4.53">account we need to demand that this</text>
  <text start="1443.56" dur="5.79">stuff is investigated exposed and</text>
  <text start="1446.68" dur="4.47">stopped it should be the church it</text>
  <text start="1449.35" dur="4.59">should be the church the problem is is</text>
  <text start="1451.15" dur="4.29">that either you have whole church</text>
  <text start="1453.94" dur="3.33">organizations that have been actually</text>
  <text start="1455.44" dur="3.07">compromised in this type of stuff as</text>
  <text start="1457.27" dur="4.27">horrible as that sound</text>
  <text start="1458.51" dur="4.68">or you have and I don&amp;#39;t know if you</text>
  <text start="1461.54" dur="4.56">listen to Mark Taylor much but he talks</text>
  <text start="1463.19" dur="5.07">about the 501 C 3 and how a lot of</text>
  <text start="1466.1" dur="4.8">churches that become part of the 501 C 3</text>
  <text start="1468.26" dur="4.02">system we&amp;#39;re forget about satanic</text>
  <text start="1470.9" dur="3">pedophilia ISM they don&amp;#39;t even want to</text>
  <text start="1472.28" dur="3.96">talk about even things about like</text>
  <text start="1473.9" dur="4.89">abortion or homosexuality because they</text>
  <text start="1476.24" dur="4.32">might lose their 501c3 status yeah let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1478.79" dur="5.52">let seems like a like a noose around</text>
  <text start="1480.56" dur="6.33">their neck to me exactly exactly I can</text>
  <text start="1484.31" dur="5.28">say you know distinctively that the</text>
  <text start="1486.89" dur="6.03">church that I attend you know the pastor</text>
  <text start="1489.59" dur="5.97">is very much openly against abortion you</text>
  <text start="1492.92" dur="5.61">know and he has you know backed this</text>
  <text start="1495.56" dur="4.56">work this podcast since it started and I</text>
  <text start="1498.53" dur="6.09">have done my very best to expose that</text>
  <text start="1500.12" dur="6.81">evil you know so I mean but how okay let</text>
  <text start="1504.62" dur="4.32">me let me ask this question how does one</text>
  <text start="1506.93" dur="4.05">get their mind around because you said</text>
  <text start="1508.94" dur="5.55">it clearly our minds are not capable of</text>
  <text start="1510.98" dur="6.63">accepting such trauma and horror I mean</text>
  <text start="1514.49" dur="5.64">the horror of this is just unnerving so</text>
  <text start="1517.61" dur="5.34">how would you even go about going from</text>
  <text start="1520.13" dur="5.28">disbelief perhaps to no way this is</text>
  <text start="1522.95" dur="5.55">impossible this cannot happen how do you</text>
  <text start="1525.41" dur="5.7">even accept that yes it&amp;#39;s happening and</text>
  <text start="1528.5" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s real it&amp;#39;s a tough thing to approach</text>
  <text start="1531.11" dur="4.74">so again it&amp;#39;s you know like if you go to</text>
  <text start="1534.17" dur="4.2">my youth channel and you go back from</text>
  <text start="1535.85" dur="4.46">late July all the way till now just the</text>
  <text start="1538.37" dur="4.02">totality of evidence I think will</text>
  <text start="1540.31" dur="4.24">convince people that this is definitely</text>
  <text start="1542.39" dur="3.75">an issue it&amp;#39;s definitely true the other</text>
  <text start="1544.55" dur="3.09">thing though I want to sort of add into</text>
  <text start="1546.14" dur="3.06">this and I think this is very important</text>
  <text start="1547.64" dur="4.56">and and this is another reason I think</text>
  <text start="1549.2" dur="5.79">why my subscribers have gone up so much</text>
  <text start="1552.2" dur="4.8">is that while it is very important to</text>
  <text start="1554.99" dur="5.01">expose the unfruitful works of darkness</text>
  <text start="1557" dur="5.04">I don&amp;#39;t need people there I always point</text>
  <text start="1560" dur="4.53">them back toward the Messiah I always</text>
  <text start="1562.04" dur="5.22">back toward him and his truth and how</text>
  <text start="1564.53" dur="5.52">his the purity of his gospel and his</text>
  <text start="1567.26" dur="5.16">word is the only way to true healing and</text>
  <text start="1570.05" dur="3.48">not only for an SRE survivor but even</text>
  <text start="1572.42" dur="3.63">people who are learning about this</text>
  <text start="1573.53" dur="4.59">horrific stuff and so I always try to do</text>
  <text start="1576.05" dur="4.38">that and I think that that helps people</text>
  <text start="1578.12" dur="4.53">get through because yeah like you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1580.43" dur="4.2">been saying I mean reporting on this is</text>
  <text start="1582.65" dur="4.56">is very dark this is a very dark</text>
  <text start="1584.63" dur="4.8">material and when I&amp;#39;m having to sort of</text>
  <text start="1587.21" dur="5.01">a way through this stuff it can affect</text>
  <text start="1589.43" dur="4.8">you so I&amp;#39;ll have to go out like even the</text>
  <text start="1592.22" dur="3.75">day after I made one bid I went out I</text>
  <text start="1594.23" dur="4.199">just spent some time I walked outside</text>
  <text start="1595.97" dur="4.38">went out into the to the mountains here</text>
  <text start="1598.429" dur="4.291">in Alaska it&amp;#39;s very easy to get lost in</text>
  <text start="1600.35" dur="4.35">nature here it&amp;#39;s a very good thing but</text>
  <text start="1602.72" dur="4.47">it just helps me refocus myself back</text>
  <text start="1604.7" dur="4.77">lawn on Messiah so I think that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1607.19" dur="5.099">that&amp;#39;s really really crucial really</text>
  <text start="1609.47" dur="4.829">really important it&amp;#39;s important to know</text>
  <text start="1612.289" dur="3.601">this stuff and to make people learn and</text>
  <text start="1614.299" dur="4.561">expose it but it&amp;#39;s also important to</text>
  <text start="1615.89" dur="7.47">keep our focus on him and also I I think</text>
  <text start="1618.86" dur="7.26">that I think that Yahshua Jesus he his</text>
  <text start="1623.36" dur="4.92">whole plan is he wants this stuff to be</text>
  <text start="1626.12" dur="4.14">exposed because when we talk about</text>
  <text start="1628.28" dur="4.649">someone like Billy Graham who is this</text>
  <text start="1630.26" dur="5.61">you know a satanic pedophile who abused</text>
  <text start="1632.929" dur="5.821">Fiona Barnett among other little girls</text>
  <text start="1635.87" dur="5.52">when you look at what he preached it was</text>
  <text start="1638.75" dur="4.89">not it was not the gospel he was</text>
  <text start="1641.39" dur="6.029">preaching a very counterfeit sort of</text>
  <text start="1643.64" dur="6.84">greasy grace you know just believe in</text>
  <text start="1647.419" dur="4.921">Jesus near fine and even his own crusade</text>
  <text start="1650.48" dur="3.21">admits that when people would rush to</text>
  <text start="1652.34" dur="4.56">the altar his Crusades</text>
  <text start="1653.69" dur="4.92">one out of excuse me three out of four</text>
  <text start="1656.9" dur="3.09">of those people within a year we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1658.61" dur="3.439">living in sin again they were just</text>
  <text start="1659.99" dur="5.4">living in sin and really not you know</text>
  <text start="1662.049" dur="5.62">walking in Messiah so I think what what</text>
  <text start="1665.39" dur="4.649">what&amp;#39;s being done here is that all the</text>
  <text start="1667.669" dur="4.441">stuff is being excuse exposed because</text>
  <text start="1670.039" dur="5.221">God has wanted to bring back people back</text>
  <text start="1672.11" dur="6.33">to the purity of his word back to the</text>
  <text start="1675.26" dur="5.31">purity of a spirit back to a gospel that</text>
  <text start="1678.44" dur="4.8">preaches repentance like true repentance</text>
  <text start="1680.57" dur="4.41">where you you you forsake this and you</text>
  <text start="1683.24" dur="3.84">confess and forsake your sin you totally</text>
  <text start="1684.98" dur="4.14">grab a hold of the Messiah and you allow</text>
  <text start="1687.08" dur="3.99">the holiness of a spirit to fill you and</text>
  <text start="1689.12" dur="4.26">and you fill out the the fruits of his</text>
  <text start="1691.07" dur="4.469">spirit and and and the power that is</text>
  <text start="1693.38" dur="5.25">supposed to accompany the gospel not</text>
  <text start="1695.539" dur="6.451">this sort of lukewarm Americana</text>
  <text start="1698.63" dur="4.71">Christianity where well yeah we say we</text>
  <text start="1701.99" dur="3.96">love Jesus but our hearts really aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1703.34" dur="3.81">aren&amp;#39;t in it and I&amp;#39;d that&amp;#39;s kind of part</text>
  <text start="1705.95" dur="5.37">of what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="1707.15" dur="7.56">if someone by hearing this episode maybe</text>
  <text start="1711.32" dur="5.13">they realize man I&amp;#39;ve got some stuff in</text>
  <text start="1714.71" dur="4.469">my past I&amp;#39;ve got some skeletons in my</text>
  <text start="1716.45" dur="5.01">closet maybe they&amp;#39;re an MKULTRA survivor</text>
  <text start="1719.179" dur="4.681">maybe they&amp;#39;re an SRE survivor what would</text>
  <text start="1721.46" dur="4.65">you say to them well first of all if</text>
  <text start="1723.86" dur="5.669">you&amp;#39;re an SRA or an MP</text>
  <text start="1726.11" dur="5.49">for survival survivor just realize and</text>
  <text start="1729.529" dur="3.841">know that only the Messiah only his</text>
  <text start="1731.6" dur="3.27">blood and his spirit can fully heal you</text>
  <text start="1733.37" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s the only way you&amp;#39;re gonna be able</text>
  <text start="1734.87" dur="6.779">to to really get that past resolve for</text>
  <text start="1738.62" dur="5.039">yourself also you don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t um</text>
  <text start="1741.649" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t blame yourself a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1743.659" dur="4.981">will say oh you know something was wrong</text>
  <text start="1745.789" dur="4.471">with me no you you were a little child</text>
  <text start="1748.64" dur="3.779">you were defenseless you couldn&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="1750.26" dur="3.96">what happened to you but I&amp;#39;ve noticed</text>
  <text start="1752.419" dur="2.791">that a lot of sra survivors who haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1754.22" dur="2.22">fully healed they&amp;#39;ll still blame</text>
  <text start="1755.21" dur="2.939">themselves they&amp;#39;ll think that somehow</text>
  <text start="1756.44" dur="3.719">something was wrong with them and it</text>
  <text start="1758.149" dur="3.39">wasn&amp;#39;t they were just being used as</text>
  <text start="1760.159" dur="5.071">little children and they didn&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="1761.539" dur="7.62">voice in the matter and the second thing</text>
  <text start="1765.23" dur="5.789">is is that the more open you are about</text>
  <text start="1769.159" dur="3.571">it whether you want to come on to my</text>
  <text start="1771.019" dur="3.571">each channel or somebody else who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1772.73" dur="2.64">reporting on this the better it is for</text>
  <text start="1774.59" dur="3.089">you</text>
  <text start="1775.37" dur="3.779">I&amp;#39;ve had people who back they just had a</text>
  <text start="1777.679" dur="3.391">lady her name is Tammy and she was very</text>
  <text start="1779.149" dur="4.221">nervous about coming on and talking</text>
  <text start="1781.07" dur="5.069">about what had happened in her past but</text>
  <text start="1783.37" dur="4.149">but the more that she was open and the</text>
  <text start="1786.139" dur="4.201">more that she just sort of declared what</text>
  <text start="1787.519" dur="4.38">happened the safer she became and and</text>
  <text start="1790.34" dur="3.87">I&amp;#39;ve seen this with a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1791.899" dur="4.231">where they&amp;#39;ll come out because the thing</text>
  <text start="1794.21" dur="4.709">is these people who perpetuate the stuff</text>
  <text start="1796.13" dur="4.47">they like to stay in the shadows they</text>
  <text start="1798.919" dur="2.941">don&amp;#39;t want to be exposed they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1800.6" dur="3">to be that&amp;#39;s how they gain power and</text>
  <text start="1801.86" dur="4.77">they want their victims to stay in the</text>
  <text start="1803.6" dur="5.579">shadows that&amp;#39;s how they love darkness</text>
  <text start="1806.63" dur="4.35">rather than light exactly but the more</text>
  <text start="1809.179" dur="3.451">they come out into the open and they</text>
  <text start="1810.98" dur="3.72">share their stories not only is it a</text>
  <text start="1812.63" dur="4.11">blessing and does it encourage those who</text>
  <text start="1814.7" dur="3.599">may have also gone through this as SRA</text>
  <text start="1816.74" dur="4.319">survivors that have been afraid to come</text>
  <text start="1818.299" dur="4.681">out but also it these people who are</text>
  <text start="1821.059" dur="3.48">operating in the CIA or these</text>
  <text start="1822.98" dur="3.72">intelligent agencies or whatever they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1824.539" dur="3.6">perpetuating is there it&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="1826.7" dur="5.069">lot harder for them to take you out</text>
  <text start="1828.139" dur="5.13">because now oh look 70,000 subscribers</text>
  <text start="1831.769" dur="3.51">just watched your testimony they know</text>
  <text start="1833.269" dur="4.26">who you are so if they take you out then</text>
  <text start="1835.279" dur="3.181">then then oh wait a minute</text>
  <text start="1837.529" dur="3.481">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna be starting to ask</text>
  <text start="1838.46" dur="5.069">questions so they want these survivors</text>
  <text start="1841.01" dur="3.72">to hide and and to not come out and to</text>
  <text start="1843.529" dur="2.37">end the media tries to that&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1844.73" dur="3.03">easier for them to deal with them that</text>
  <text start="1845.899" dur="4.081">way but when they start coming out</text>
  <text start="1847.76" dur="5.82">especially as many as we are coming out</text>
  <text start="1849.98" dur="6.419">being vocal it does a lot of good both</text>
  <text start="1853.58" dur="4.47">in ministering to others and forcing the</text>
  <text start="1856.399" dur="4.381">bad guys to</text>
  <text start="1858.05" dur="5.73">into their shadows and to be scared they</text>
  <text start="1860.78" dur="7.95">have to scurry away so amen amen</text>
  <text start="1863.78" dur="7.44">well Daniel thank you thank you for what</text>
  <text start="1868.73" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;re doing I know that this is not an</text>
  <text start="1871.22" dur="6.21">easy topic to swallow I know that this</text>
  <text start="1873.29" dur="7.53">is a rather challenging but thank you</text>
  <text start="1877.43" dur="5.52">for taking up the mantle and offering a</text>
  <text start="1880.82" dur="4.44">platform for those that didn&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="1882.95" dur="4.92">voice to have one well yeah absolutely</text>
  <text start="1885.26" dur="3.75">it was sort of something where I almost</text>
  <text start="1887.87" dur="3.12">didn&amp;#39;t have a choice</text>
  <text start="1889.01" dur="4.02">because you know when God told you to do</text>
  <text start="1890.99" dur="4.35">something you you&amp;#39;ve got to do it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1893.03" dur="4.53">been a blessing I mean you know to see</text>
  <text start="1895.34" dur="4.74">these people be able to come forward and</text>
  <text start="1897.56" dur="4.32">to have a platform to speak out it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1900.08" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s a blessing to me because I see how</text>
  <text start="1901.88" dur="5.16">it administers to them and even some of</text>
  <text start="1905.15" dur="3.51">these SRA survivors who have been very</text>
  <text start="1907.04" dur="3.72">nervous or scared about coming on but</text>
  <text start="1908.66" dur="3.78">once they do they almost always come</text>
  <text start="1910.76" dur="3.24">back to me and say Oh Daniel I&amp;#39;m so glad</text>
  <text start="1912.44" dur="3.42">I did that because I feel so much better</text>
  <text start="1914" dur="3.81">first of all getting this off my chest</text>
  <text start="1915.86" dur="3.42">but second of all so many of my</text>
  <text start="1917.81" dur="3.24">subscribers or other people will start</text>
  <text start="1919.28" dur="3.42">reaching out to them and saying oh thank</text>
  <text start="1921.05" dur="3.15">you for sharing this story because it</text>
  <text start="1922.7" dur="4.32">helped me through this or it helped me</text>
  <text start="1924.2" dur="4.53">through that or even people who are not</text>
  <text start="1927.02" dur="4.05">sre survivors maybe they were just</text>
  <text start="1928.73" dur="5.52">victims of pedophilia in their own</text>
  <text start="1931.07" dur="6.3">families but hearing these stories of</text>
  <text start="1934.25" dur="5.85">how people overcame it blesses them and</text>
  <text start="1937.37" dur="4.56">it touches the ministry to them so so</text>
  <text start="1940.1" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been a huge blessing for</text>
  <text start="1941.93" dur="5.4">for me to be able to facilitate that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1945.11" dur="5.04">reminded in either first or second</text>
  <text start="1947.33" dur="5.28">Corinthians where Paul says we are able</text>
  <text start="1950.15" dur="5.13">to comfort others with the comfort that</text>
  <text start="1952.61" dur="4.65">we have received and so I think that</text>
  <text start="1955.28" dur="5.7">that really speaks to what you were just</text>

  <text start="1967.13" dur="3">there were a lot of statements made</text>

  <text start="1970.13" dur="4.65">hard to believe and I understand that</text>
  <text start="1971.99" dur="4.32">but I can tell you honestly I&amp;#39;ve done my</text>
  <text start="1974.78" dur="3.66">research and I&amp;#39;ve done I listened to a</text>
