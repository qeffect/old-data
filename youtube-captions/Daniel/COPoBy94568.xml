  <text start="7.77" dur="4.77">this afternoon so there&amp;#39;s this issue</text>
  <text start="10.71" dur="5.129">that&amp;#39;s come up and it&amp;#39;s come up twice</text>
  <text start="12.54" dur="6.239">now and this issue is this in the name</text>
  <text start="15.839" dur="5.011">of love unity love wonderful but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="18.779" dur="3.99">forget about the truth the first time it</text>
  <text start="20.85" dur="3.54">came up well it&amp;#39;s come up a lot of times</text>
  <text start="22.769" dur="4.321">in my life but recently when i was at</text>
  <text start="24.39" dur="4.02">this a abortion clinic on shabbat and</text>
  <text start="27.09" dur="3.96">preaching this woman came up and said</text>
  <text start="28.41" dur="4.38">hey you know this is negative energy and</text>

  <text start="40.86" dur="3.57">these murdered babies and then the</text>
  <text start="42.96" dur="4.32">second time it popped up was actually</text>
  <text start="44.43" dur="5.609">within messianic sand that is i was on</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="5.759">this thread on facebook and this guy had</text>
  <text start="50.039" dur="5.04">this very religious spirit and was come</text>
  <text start="53.039" dur="4.77">come to find out he didn&amp;#39;t even believe</text>
  <text start="55.079" dur="4.23">in the writings of Paul which dealt with</text>
  <text start="57.809" dur="3.451">this so many times over the years people</text>
  <text start="59.309" dur="4.081">coming against Apostle Paul folks</text>
  <text start="61.26" dur="3.63">Apostle Paul was a master of Torah he</text>
  <text start="63.39" dur="3.54">knew it backwards and forwards and he</text>
  <text start="64.89" dur="3.979">was faithful and he was made a spectacle</text>
  <text start="66.93" dur="4.799">before angels and Men and went through</text>
  <text start="68.869" dur="6.311">shipwrecks and being beaten many times</text>
  <text start="71.729" dur="5.311">and I mean he I mean next to Messiah</text>
  <text start="75.18" dur="3.03">he&amp;#39;s about the best guy out there that</text>
  <text start="77.04" dur="3.719">went through all the trials and</text>
  <text start="78.21" dur="4.08">tribulations that none of us have even</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="3.691">tasted and yet he was faithful to you</text>
  <text start="82.29" dur="4.59">and he said and he had the right to say</text>
  <text start="84.45" dur="4.47">follow me as I followed Messiah anyway</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="3.989">this guy was rejecting Paul and so when</text>
  <text start="88.92" dur="4.44">I brought this up all of a sudden he</text>
  <text start="90.869" dur="4.081">shifts his tactic and says you know we</text>
  <text start="93.36" dur="3.09">just need to all be unified and loving</text>
  <text start="94.95" dur="4.2">and you know doctrine doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="96.45" dur="4.68">matter keeping the commandments and</text>
  <text start="99.15" dur="3.749">obeying Scripture and believing in</text>
  <text start="101.13" dur="5.309">Scripture these things kind of matter</text>
  <text start="102.899" dur="5.941">they matter a lot truth rejoices in love</text>
  <text start="106.439" dur="4.591">love rejoices in the truth first</text>
  <text start="108.84" dur="4.38">Corinthians 13 you can&amp;#39;t have love</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="4.26">without truth you can&amp;#39;t have love with</text>
  <text start="113.22" dur="4.109">righteous judgment these are aspects of</text>
  <text start="115.29" dur="4.109">love that our American culture wants to</text>
  <text start="117.329" dur="3.841">ignore and even some within the</text>
  <text start="119.399" dur="3.811">Messianic Hebrew roots and Christian</text>
  <text start="121.17" dur="3.809">movements want to ignore trying to bring</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="4.409">unity and love at the expense of truth</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="4.321">can&amp;#39;t do it of course I understand we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="4.051">all at different levels and we&amp;#39;re all at</text>
  <text start="129.3" dur="3.72">different maturities and walks and</text>
  <text start="131.67" dur="1.77">trying to discover the truth and I</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="2.28">understand</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="3.69">we have to be loving and kind toward</text>
  <text start="135.3" dur="3.84">each other but when someone&amp;#39;s rejecting</text>
  <text start="137.13" dur="4.32">all the writings of Paul come on that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="139.14" dur="3.93">a pretty major deal when someone doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="141.45" dur="3.21">want to defend murder babies that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="143.07" dur="5.61">pretty major deal so we need to make</text>
  <text start="144.66" dur="6.66">sure that yes love&amp;#39;s important but love</text>
  <text start="148.68" dur="4.44">always rejoices in the truth this is</text>
