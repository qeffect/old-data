  <text start="2.639" dur="6.451">Torah restoration ministries the website</text>
  <text start="4.65" dur="6.51">is wws and Torah comm so I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="9.09" dur="5.12">getting some very rude emails and</text>
  <text start="11.16" dur="5.25">messages over YouTube from a man who</text>
  <text start="14.21" dur="5.47">wanted to challenge me to a debate I</text>
  <text start="16.41" dur="5.1">decided to just delete his emails and</text>
  <text start="19.68" dur="5.099">ignore him because he&amp;#39;s a he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="21.51" dur="5.37">blowhard but then it occurred to me why</text>
  <text start="24.779" dur="4.231">don&amp;#39;t I use his accusations and his</text>
  <text start="26.88" dur="5.25">attacks because that&amp;#39;s what they are</text>
  <text start="29.01" dur="4.92">they aren&amp;#39;t really questions and aired</text>
  <text start="32.13" dur="4.019">them publicly and responded them</text>
  <text start="33.93" dur="5.129">publicly so that it might benefit some</text>
  <text start="36.149" dur="5.25">of those of you out there who maybe need</text>
  <text start="39.059" dur="4.68">your faith strengthened or benefit those</text>
  <text start="41.399" dur="5.101">of you who need to be convicted so that</text>
  <text start="43.739" dur="8.73">you&amp;#39;ll obey the truth so I thought I</text>
  <text start="46.5" dur="7.32">would use this for good he wants to</text>
  <text start="52.469" dur="4.5">first of all make the basic contention</text>
  <text start="53.82" dur="5.85">that the law of Jesus the commandments</text>
  <text start="56.969" dur="6.031">that Jesus Yahshua taught are different</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="6.239">from the law of Moses okay we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="63" dur="6.81">make this very very simple if you go to</text>
  <text start="65.909" dur="9.811">Exodus chapter 20 Yahweh very clearly</text>
  <text start="69.81" dur="10.68">gives the law to Moses in first Timothy</text>
  <text start="75.72" dur="7.92">chapter 3 verse 16 it says yah was</text>
  <text start="80.49" dur="8.91">manifest in the flesh that would be</text>
  <text start="83.64" dur="10.769">Jesus Yahshua so if Yahweh gave the law</text>
  <text start="89.4" dur="8.609">to Moses and Yahweh is Jesus aka Yahshua</text>
  <text start="94.409" dur="7.17">manifest in the flesh the law of Moses</text>
  <text start="98.009" dur="4.25">is the law of Jesus I&amp;#39;m gonna say it</text>
  <text start="101.579" dur="3.54">again</text>
  <text start="102.259" dur="3.64">Yahweh gave the laws to Moses in Exodus</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="4.411">20</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="5.871">first Timothy 3:16 says God was manifest</text>
  <text start="109.53" dur="6.03">in the flesh that would be Jesus Yahshua</text>
  <text start="111.77" dur="6.94">therefore since yah gave the law to</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="5.76">Moses and yah is Jesus manifest in the</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="6.089">flesh Jesus gave the law to Moses</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="7.139">therefore the law of Moses is the law of</text>
  <text start="124.799" dur="7.381">Jesus it&amp;#39;s very simple the truth always</text>
  <text start="128.459" dur="5.041">is so then the misnomer comes in well</text>
  <text start="132.18" dur="3.75">what about acts 15</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="4.83">where you know the Pharisees were trying</text>
  <text start="135.93" dur="6.5">to impose the quote-unquote circumcision</text>
  <text start="138.33" dur="7.29">of Moses and Paul ardently opposed this</text>
  <text start="142.43" dur="4.87">Yahshua Jesus opposed many of the things</text>
  <text start="145.62" dur="7.61">the Pharisees were teaching as well in</text>
  <text start="147.3" dur="10.1">in the Gospels let me ask you a question</text>
  <text start="153.23" dur="6.45">did circumcision come from Moses no</text>
  <text start="157.4" dur="6.28">where did it come from</text>
  <text start="159.68" dur="6.94">circumcision came from Yahweh to Abraham</text>
  <text start="163.68" dur="6.54">it&amp;#39;s the circumcision of Abraham Genesis</text>
  <text start="166.62" dur="6.36">17 verse 10 circumcision was never given</text>
  <text start="170.22" dur="5.22">to Moses it was given to Abraham this</text>
  <text start="172.98" dur="5.22">so-called circumcision of Moses that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="175.44" dur="4.92">discussed in Acts chapter 15 has nothing</text>
  <text start="178.2" dur="4.59">to do with the commandment the very good</text>
  <text start="180.36" dur="5.04">commandment of circumcision given by</text>
  <text start="182.79" dur="4.29">Yahweh to Abraham the quote unquote</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="4.14">circumcision of Moses was a</text>
  <text start="187.08" dur="5.85">colloquialism used for all the extra</text>
  <text start="189.54" dur="6.33">laws and traditions that the Pharisees</text>
  <text start="192.93" dur="5.339">and Sadducees and rabbis had invented to</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="3.929">put on top of the Torah to be a burden</text>
  <text start="198.269" dur="2.991">to the people and to try to control</text>
  <text start="199.799" dur="5.371">people and put them under their thumb</text>
  <text start="201.26" dur="6.49">this is what Yahshua opposed this is</text>
  <text start="205.17" dur="4.98">what Apostle Paul opposed they opposed</text>
  <text start="207.75" dur="5.13">the traditions and doctrines of men that</text>
  <text start="210.15" dur="5.22">the rabbis had invented that had nothing</text>
  <text start="212.88" dur="6.079">to do with the written Torah this is the</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="5.7">quote-unquote circumcision of Moses</text>
  <text start="218.959" dur="4.75">circumcision itself that was given to</text>
