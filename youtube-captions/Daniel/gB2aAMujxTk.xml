  <text start="245.17" dur="5.59">here&amp;#39;s the deal Daniel this guy runs a</text>
  <text start="247.73" dur="4.77">major news website media website and he</text>
  <text start="250.76" dur="3.78">asked us to pray because they were</text>
  <text start="252.5" dur="4.38">threatening to basically the the big</text>
  <text start="254.54" dur="4.379">tech censors were tending for take him</text>
  <text start="256.88" dur="4.169">down he so here&amp;#39;s the dear Daniel</text>
  <text start="258.919" dur="4.441">there&amp;#39;s still one warning against my</text>
  <text start="261.049" dur="4.471">page for sharing what Facebook deemed to</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="3.45">be partially false news of course that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="265.52" dur="3.57">bogus but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what</text>
  <text start="266.81" dur="3.45">Facebook is is because they claim to be</text>
  <text start="269.09" dur="3.24">judge jury and executioner</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="3.689">I think the warning lasts for two weeks</text>
  <text start="272.33" dur="3.36">so hopefully it will fall off soon they</text>
  <text start="273.949" dur="3.84">say that while your page has a warning</text>
  <text start="275.69" dur="3.599">that you have reduced reach meaning a</text>
  <text start="277.789" dur="3.69">shadow ban your page and don&amp;#39;t show your</text>
  <text start="279.289" dur="5.641">posts to as many people well in light of</text>
  <text start="281.479" dur="4.981">all that my website media news page has</text>
  <text start="284.93" dur="3.299">suddenly started doing really well it</text>
  <text start="286.46" dur="4.17">always adds in flows I started it from</text>
  <text start="288.229" dur="3.901">scratch back in 2015 so I&amp;#39;m familiar</text>
  <text start="290.63" dur="4.25">with the ups and downs and guys this is</text>
  <text start="292.13" dur="5.819">a very pro Trump media website he runs</text>
  <text start="294.88" dur="4.45">but recently it&amp;#39;s been on fire and then</text>
  <text start="297.949" dur="3.15">yesterday I found out that on Sunday I</text>
  <text start="299.33" dur="4.559">had the second most popular post of the</text>
  <text start="301.099" dur="4.711">entire day of all of Facebook of any</text>
  <text start="303.889" dur="3.78">category of any post I had the number</text>
  <text start="305.81" dur="4.68">two most popular of anyone on the entire</text>
  <text start="307.669" dur="6">Facebook platform I beat out Fox News by</text>
  <text start="310.49" dur="5.58">a factor of 1.5 compared to their best</text>
  <text start="313.669" dur="5.401">performing post my page has done well at</text>
  <text start="316.07" dur="4.8">times but never anything like this</text>
  <text start="319.07" dur="3.15">might have had one that went even bigger</text>
  <text start="320.87" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;m still waiting for the dust to settle</text>
  <text start="322.22" dur="4.08">on that totally caught me off guard</text>
  <text start="324.47" dur="3.78">I was literally stunned sitting in my</text>
  <text start="326.3" dur="4.2">chair when I saw my page being covered</text>
  <text start="328.25" dur="3.96">on Twitter for the most popular and keep</text>
  <text start="330.5" dur="3.78">in mind this was as I was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="332.21" dur="5.34">under reduced distribution for the</text>
  <text start="334.28" dur="4.65">warning for facebook anyway I kind of</text>
  <text start="337.55" dur="3.3">had forgotten that I had asked you in</text>
  <text start="338.93" dur="3.78">your prayer team Daniel to add me to</text>
  <text start="340.85" dur="3.3">your prayer list about this issue but</text>
  <text start="342.71" dur="2.76">suddenly today the idea struck me and</text>
  <text start="344.15" dur="3.36">the link could not have been any clearer</text>
  <text start="345.47" dur="4.26">in my mind I had to tell you this praise</text>

  <text start="351.47" dur="3.15">page I was actually very nervous when I</text>
  <text start="353.45" dur="2.79">learned this because there are enough</text>
  <text start="354.62" dur="3.66">people who hate President Trump out</text>
  <text start="356.24" dur="3.42">there they&amp;#39;ll try to report my page or</text>
  <text start="358.28" dur="3.33">take it down for just seeing news like</text>
  <text start="359.66" dur="4.11">this so I&amp;#39;m trying to be wise and not</text>
  <text start="361.61" dur="3.69">draw any extra attention to it but once</text>
  <text start="363.77" dur="3.54">I connected the dots I was super excited</text>
