  <text start="30.619" dur="4.001">complaining about things like why is</text>

  <text start="34.62" dur="5.07">you know some complaints for starting to</text>
  <text start="36.329" dur="5.461">rise up in my spirit and then all of a</text>
  <text start="39.69" dur="4.08">sudden as I was complaining or thinking</text>
  <text start="41.79" dur="6.24">about things that I you know we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="43.77" dur="7.71">pleasing to me um this voice just spoke</text>
  <text start="48.03" dur="6.63">into my mind and it said yes but Daniel</text>
  <text start="51.48" dur="5.28">have I dealt with you according to your</text>
  <text start="54.66" dur="7.44">sins or rewarded you according to your</text>
  <text start="56.76" dur="7.17">iniquities and I realize no no yeah you</text>
  <text start="62.1" dur="5.61">have not dealt with me according to my</text>
  <text start="63.93" dur="7.89">sins or according to my transgressions</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="7.89">if you had I would be dead I would be</text>
  <text start="71.82" dur="7.229">dead and then I was like all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="75.6" dur="5.55">my whole shift my whole focus shifted</text>
  <text start="79.049" dur="3.421">and I realized I shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="81.15" dur="3.66">complaining I should be very very</text>
  <text start="82.47" dur="4.02">grateful and thankful that Yahshua has</text>
  <text start="84.81" dur="4.23">not dealt with me according to my</text>
  <text start="86.49" dur="6.419">transgressions and according to my</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="6.09">iniquities and so then I I was eager to</text>
  <text start="92.909" dur="6.121">find out where that comes from and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.13" dur="5.76">in Psalm 103 since Psalm 103 10 and I</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="4.199">just want to read Psalm 103 here because</text>
  <text start="100.89" dur="3.659">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a really good song I think</text>
  <text start="103.229" dur="4.861">it&amp;#39;s appropriate for the fourth of July</text>
  <text start="104.549" dur="5.731">because joshua has certainly not dealt</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="5.16">with this nation according to our</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="5.28">transgressions I mean if he had this</text>
  <text start="113.25" dur="5.49">nation would cease to exist because of</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="5.46">all the evil that we&amp;#39;ve done this is</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="5.28">bless Yahweh on my soul and all that is</text>
  <text start="121.02" dur="5.459">within me bless His Holy Name bless</text>
  <text start="124.02" dur="5.849">Yahweh on my soul and forget not all his</text>
  <text start="126.479" dur="6.521">benefits who forgives all your</text>
  <text start="129.869" dur="5.141">iniquities who heals all your diseases</text>
  <text start="133" dur="5.01">who redeems your life from destruction</text>
  <text start="135.01" dur="5.7">who crowns you with loving kindness and</text>
  <text start="138.01" dur="4.77">tender mercies who satisfies your mouth</text>
  <text start="140.71" dur="5.1">with good things so that your youth is</text>
  <text start="142.78" dur="5.13">renewed like the Eagles Yahweh executes</text>
  <text start="145.81" dur="4.8">righteousness and judgment for all that</text>
  <text start="147.91" dur="5.13">are oppressed he has made known as ways</text>
  <text start="150.61" dur="5.58">unto Moshe his acts under the children</text>
  <text start="153.04" dur="6.54">of Israel Yahweh is merciful and</text>
  <text start="156.19" dur="6.36">gracious slow to anger and plenteous in</text>
  <text start="159.58" dur="5.52">mercy he will not always chide neither</text>
  <text start="162.55" dur="4.83">will he keep his anger forever he has</text>
  <text start="165.1" dur="4.76">not dealt with us after our sins nor</text>
  <text start="167.38" dur="5.25">rewarded us according to our iniquities</text>
  <text start="169.86" dur="4.33">that&amp;#39;s the verse right there he is not</text>
  <text start="172.63" dur="3.329">dealt with us after our sins nor</text>
  <text start="174.19" dur="3.96">rewarded us according to our iniquities</text>
  <text start="175.959" dur="4.951">for as the heaven is high above the</text>
  <text start="178.15" dur="5.43">earth so great is His mercy toward them</text>
  <text start="180.91" dur="4.98">that fear Him as far as the east is from</text>
  <text start="183.58" dur="5.97">the west so far as he removed our</text>
  <text start="185.89" dur="6.75">transgressions from us like as a father</text>
  <text start="189.55" dur="5.46">pities his children so Yahweh pities</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="5.58">them that fear him brain knows our frame</text>
  <text start="195.01" dur="6.09">he remembers that we are dust as for man</text>
  <text start="198.22" dur="5.46">his days are as grass as a flower of the</text>
  <text start="201.1" dur="5.58">field so he flourishes for the wind</text>
  <text start="203.68" dur="5.52">passes over it and it is gone and the</text>
  <text start="206.68" dur="4.32">place the rug shall know it no more but</text>
  <text start="209.2" dur="5.009">the mercy of Yahweh is from everlasting</text>
  <text start="211" dur="5.549">to everlasting upon them that fear him</text>
  <text start="214.209" dur="5.25">and his righteousness unto children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.549" dur="4.741">children to such as keep his covenant</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="4.651">and to those that remember his</text>
  <text start="221.29" dur="5.52">commandments to do them that&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="224.11" dur="4.62">very important verse right there Yahweh</text>
  <text start="226.81" dur="5.91">has prepared his throne in the heavens</text>
  <text start="228.73" dur="6.75">and his kingdom rules over all bless yo</text>
  <text start="232.72" dur="5.46">way he his angels that excel in strength</text>
