  <text start="19.5" dur="3.93">away in the desert or taking time to go</text>
  <text start="21.81" dur="4.32">up to the mountain to be alone with his</text>

  <text start="59.46" dur="4.47">destination on the opposite side of town</text>
  <text start="61.26" dur="3.99">from where I live the best most logical</text>
  <text start="63.93" dur="4.17">way to get there is to take the major</text>
  <text start="65.25" dur="5.1">freeways that ring Portland Oregon but</text>
  <text start="68.1" dur="4.86">yah had me trace a very unusual route</text>

  <text start="98.46" dur="5.31">frame I went inside and a lady maybe in</text>
  <text start="101.61" dur="5.789">her mid-20s stood at the desk asking how</text>

  <text start="164.95" dur="3.869">route even though I could cut my time in</text>
  <text start="166.69" dur="3.659">half by again just taking the logical</text>
  <text start="168.819" dur="4.621">course of action using the freeways to</text>
  <text start="170.349" dur="5.28">get back home this time I made sure to</text>

  <text start="338.74" dur="4.38">in the spirit spending time with abba</text>
  <text start="341.32" dur="4.23">learning to listen to his voice than</text>
