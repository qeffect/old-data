  <text start="981.29" dur="4.26">in a new hot war really under any</text>
  <text start="983.42" dur="3.9">president so the fact that President</text>
  <text start="985.55" dur="4.59">trot you know it&amp;#39;s so funny cuz the</text>
  <text start="987.32" dur="4.59">media before President Trump entered in</text>
  <text start="990.14" dur="3.99">an op-ed to office the media were just</text>
  <text start="991.91" dur="4.71">panicking saying all President Trump is</text>
  <text start="994.13" dur="4.98">gonna you know lead us into a world war</text>
  <text start="996.62" dur="3.93">and and and then even in the first you</text>
  <text start="999.11" dur="3.659">know six months of president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1000.55" dur="3.75">presidency the media was constantly</text>
  <text start="1002.769" dur="3.211">saying oh he&amp;#39;s got to lead us into a war</text>
  <text start="1004.3" dur="3.81">with North Korea he&amp;#39;s gonna lead us into</text>

  <text start="1011.7" dur="4.75">he&amp;#39;s a president of peace he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1014.44" dur="4.8">president of peace very similar to John</text>
  <text start="1016.45" dur="8.609">F Kennedy so yeah I think that&amp;#39;s awesome</text>
  <text start="1019.24" dur="8.16">awesome to to note that people wanted me</text>
  <text start="1025.059" dur="4.231">to give an update on filled McConnell if</text>
  <text start="1027.4" dur="3.63">you&amp;#39;ve not been watching field</text>
  <text start="1029.29" dur="5.279">McConnell&amp;#39;s channel he still does give</text>
  <text start="1031.03" dur="5.669">updates from his jail cell on the phone</text>
  <text start="1034.569" dur="3.901">they give scriptural updates and then of</text>
  <text start="1036.699" dur="5.431">course Kirk Pendergrass from ich laws</text>
  <text start="1038.47" dur="5.31">also gives updates as well but basically</text>
  <text start="1042.13" dur="4.77">what&amp;#39;s happened is the state of</text>
  <text start="1043.78" dur="5.04">Wisconsin issued a continuance which</text>
  <text start="1046.9" dur="6.72">basically means they tacked on another</text>
  <text start="1048.82" dur="6.87">60 days on to the initial 45 days that</text>
  <text start="1053.62" dur="4.08">they know that Florida originally had to</text>
  <text start="1055.69" dur="5.52">extradite field McConnell down to</text>
  <text start="1057.7" dur="5.79">Florida so basically by them adding on</text>
  <text start="1061.21" dur="4.5">another 60 days on top of the you know</text>
  <text start="1063.49" dur="3.66">45 days they should have released him</text>
  <text start="1065.71" dur="4.2">after 45 days that&amp;#39;s what the law states</text>
  <text start="1067.15" dur="5.85">but Wisconsin tacked on another 60 days</text>
  <text start="1069.91" dur="7.11">so basically he&amp;#39;s in jail at least until</text>
  <text start="1073" dur="6.419">February 2nd 2020 at this point assuming</text>
  <text start="1077.02" dur="4.8">that Florida does not extradite him</text>
  <text start="1079.419" dur="4.711">which we don&amp;#39;t think Florida will</text>
  <text start="1081.82" dur="4.23">extradite him because the governor of</text>
  <text start="1084.13" dur="6.39">Florida seems to be Pro Trump and on our</text>
  <text start="1086.05" dur="6.09">side so you know adding on another 60</text>
  <text start="1090.52" dur="3.72">days it&amp;#39;s just it seems like Wisconsin</text>
  <text start="1092.14" dur="3.39">is just sort of making things up as they</text>
  <text start="1094.24" dur="4.23">go along we shouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="1095.53" dur="5.25">because of the corruption that&amp;#39;s in our</text>
  <text start="1098.47" dur="3.99">court system but we definitely need to</text>
  <text start="1100.78" dur="5.04">continue to keep Phil McConnell in much</text>
  <text start="1102.46" dur="4.94">prayer although Romans 8:28 yeah is</text>
