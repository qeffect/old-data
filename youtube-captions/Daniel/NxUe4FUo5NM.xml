  <text start="15.57" dur="5.52">those who did not take the bart mark of</text>
  <text start="18.539" dur="4.261">the beast but we&amp;#39;re not partakers of the</text>
  <text start="21.09" dur="4.109">first resurrection the few mortals that</text>
  <text start="22.8" dur="3.75">survived all that their mortals going</text>
  <text start="25.199" dur="3.09">two thousand years and they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="26.55" dur="4.739">babies and children and populating the</text>
  <text start="28.289" dur="6.081">earth so we have a thousand years and</text>
  <text start="31.289" dur="8.191">this thousand years is described in</text>
  <text start="34.37" dur="6.7">Zechariah 14 says during this period all</text>
  <text start="39.48" dur="3.48">nations of the earth will come up to</text>
  <text start="41.07" dur="4.1">keep the peace of Sukkot at Jerusalem</text>

  <text start="45.17" dur="5.5">nation that does not will receive a</text>
  <text start="47.969" dur="5.311">plague of drought so there will still be</text>
  <text start="50.67" dur="6.15">sin going on during this thousand years</text>
  <text start="53.28" dur="4.799">it will be limited because what happens</text>
  <text start="56.82" dur="3.6">at the beginning of this thousand years</text>
  <text start="58.079" dur="8.421">is Satan according to Revelation chapter</text>
  <text start="60.42" dur="10.53">20 Satan is bound down in the abyss</text>
  <text start="66.5" dur="6.07">Satan is bound down here and he no</text>
  <text start="70.95" dur="3.39">longer has any influence his fallen</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="4.47">angels no longer have any influence on</text>
  <text start="74.34" dur="4.41">the earth and Yasha was ruling and</text>
  <text start="77.04" dur="4.41">reigning from Jerusalem we&amp;#39;re ruling and</text>
  <text start="78.75" dur="5.85">reigning with him as as kings and</text>
  <text start="81.45" dur="5.73">priests with him and there&amp;#39;s no war</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="5.55">going on Yahshua is ruling with a rod of</text>
  <text start="87.18" dur="5.91">iron any sin that does happen is dealt</text>
  <text start="90.15" dur="7.44">with swiftly and quickly the Torah goes</text>
  <text start="93.09" dur="9.45">forth from Zion and basically this is a</text>
  <text start="97.59" dur="6.69">time in which Jerusalem is established</text>
  <text start="102.54" dur="4.74">as a praise in the earth on Mount Zion</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="6.78">and living waters come out of Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="107.28" dur="7.11">and begin to heal the Earth now there</text>
  <text start="111.06" dur="5.22">are if you go into Ezekiel the last four</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="3.96">chapters of Ezekiel you read about how</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="3.78">there&amp;#39;s still the salt and marshy places</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="3.18">where there is no healing that goes on</text>
  <text start="120.06" dur="4.8">because they&amp;#39;re still pockets of the</text>
  <text start="121.53" dur="5.939">earth veteran rebellion in the Psalms</text>
  <text start="124.86" dur="5.94">you get this picture of people sort of</text>
  <text start="127.469" dur="3.861">being in the outside in the far distant</text>
  <text start="130.8" dur="2.54">places</text>
  <text start="131.33" dur="3.12">are afraid of what&amp;#39;s going on they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="2.76">want anything to do with it and they</text>
  <text start="134.45" dur="4.2">live in the lands that are parched and</text>
  <text start="136.1" dur="5.64">dry so this is during the thousand-year</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="4.65">reign when if someone dies at a hundred</text>
  <text start="141.74" dur="5.64">years old they&amp;#39;re considered a child</text>
  <text start="143.3" dur="6.12">okay so for a thousand years Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="147.38" dur="5.73">ruling and reigning over the peoples of</text>
  <text start="149.42" dur="5.52">the earth and with no war and no disease</text>
  <text start="153.11" dur="3.75">or family going on you can imagine the</text>
  <text start="154.94" dur="3.78">population earth gets to be you know</text>
  <text start="156.86" dur="3.6">huge I mean we&amp;#39;re talking trillions</text>
  <text start="158.72" dur="5.88">trillions trillions and joints people</text>
  <text start="160.46" dur="5.31">over this thousand year period another</text>
  <text start="164.6" dur="5.73">purpose for this thousand years is</text>
  <text start="165.77" dur="7.29">Israel finally becomes what it was</text>
  <text start="170.33" dur="4.95">supposed to be okay sort of the way you</text>
  <text start="173.06" dur="3.99">see under Solomon only this time Solomon</text>
  <text start="175.28" dur="2.88">doesn&amp;#39;t go into apostasy because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="177.05" dur="4.05">not Solomon who&amp;#39;s ruling and reigning</text>
  <text start="178.16" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s joshua and also during this</text>
  <text start="181.1" dur="4.68">thousand years we have a temple that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.05" dur="8.64">built and animal sacrifices that are</text>
  <text start="185.78" dur="8.91">done it&amp;#39;s done from the temple and these</text>
  <text start="191.69" dur="5.43">animal sacrifices they simply point back</text>
  <text start="194.69" dur="4.17">toward what the Messiah did thousands of</text>
  <text start="197.12" dur="3.93">years ago at the cross that&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="198.86" dur="5.58">when Yasha was nailed to the tree two</text>
  <text start="201.05" dur="4.98">thousand years ago he that that blood</text>
  <text start="204.44" dur="3.269">sacrifice is the only atonement that can</text>
  <text start="206.03" dur="3.57">cover our sin and that was true both for</text>
  <text start="207.709" dur="3.601">vanillin and all sacrifices in the past</text>
  <text start="209.6" dur="3.87">in ancient Israel they were pointing</text>
  <text start="211.31" dur="4.2">toward Yahshua and these animal</text>
  <text start="213.47" dur="4.26">sacrifices that are done which are</text>
  <text start="215.51" dur="5.88">described in Zechariah for were also</text>
  <text start="217.73" dur="6.6">described in Ezekiel the last four</text>
  <text start="221.39" dur="6.45">chapters of Ezekiel and it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="224.33" dur="5.1">described in Malachi 3 where it says</text>
  <text start="227.84" dur="4.2">that Yahshua is going to purge the</text>
  <text start="229.43" dur="4.41">litical priesthood Persian Levites and</text>
  <text start="232.04" dur="3.6">restored a little bit of the order the</text>
  <text start="233.84" dur="3.6">mist ma&amp;#39;kelda deck order which has</text>
  <text start="235.64" dur="3.66">always been is still going to be in full</text>
  <text start="237.44" dur="4.35">effect but the Levitical priesthood will</text>
  <text start="239.3" dur="3.659">be back as well and again these animal</text>
  <text start="241.79" dur="2.699">sacrifices will simply pour it back</text>
  <text start="242.959" dur="2.791">toward miss what Messiah did but</text>
  <text start="244.489" dur="2.851">basically Israel is going to be the way</text>
  <text start="245.75" dur="5.01">it was supposed to be where they got</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="6.33">intended it to be and that&amp;#39;s why in Acts</text>
  <text start="250.76" dur="4.74">chapter 1 Peter ass Joshua he said are</text>
  <text start="253.67" dur="4.02">you at this time going to restore the</text>

  <text start="275.48" dur="7.23">years or the millennium now if you</text>
  <text start="278.6" dur="7.11">continue to read in Revelation 20 it</text>
  <text start="282.71" dur="7.08">says some time after a thousand years</text>

  <text start="324.41" dur="4.89">tested you know back in the garden and</text>
  <text start="326.72" dur="5.79">saying is it says that Satan is able to</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="6.81">deceive so many of these people so many</text>
  <text start="332.51" dur="5.64">of these people that it&amp;#39;s the army he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.11" dur="3.57">able to gather from the four quarters of</text>

  <text start="348.11" dur="4.74">to you know attack the camp of the</text>
  <text start="350.06" dur="4.44">Saints Jerusalem basically and of course</text>
  <text start="352.85" dur="5.34">the fire of yaad is going to come down</text>
  <text start="354.5" dur="4.8">from heaven and basically the Satan is</text>
  <text start="358.19" dur="2.55">going to be destroyed he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="359.3" dur="4.38">thrown into the lake of fire where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.74" dur="4.89">going to burn forever ever where the</text>
  <text start="363.68" dur="3.36">false prophet and the Beast art which</text>
  <text start="365.63" dur="5.43">were throwing too late the fire way back</text>
  <text start="367.04" dur="6.81">here and it talks about in Isaiah the</text>
  <text start="371.06" dur="4.859">last chapter of Isaiah Isaiah 66 it</text>
  <text start="373.85" dur="3.27">talks about both during the millennial</text>
  <text start="375.919" dur="2.281">kingdom and even the new heavens and</text>
  <text start="377.12" dur="4.2">earth that we&amp;#39;re going to be able to</text>
  <text start="378.2" dur="4.72">behold the wicked who are burning in the</text>
  <text start="381.32" dur="2.83">lake of fire and they burn for</text>
  <text start="382.92" dur="2.43">ever and ever and ever where the worm</text>
  <text start="384.15" dur="4.17">does not die whether there is weeping</text>
  <text start="385.35" dur="5.58">and wailing and gnashing of teeth so</text>
  <text start="388.32" dur="4.08">that rebellion is very short-lived and</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s destroyed and at that point the</text>
  <text start="392.4" dur="4.95">heavens and earth says flees away</text>
  <text start="394.5" dur="5.43">because now we come to what&amp;#39;s known as</text>
  <text start="397.35" dur="5.67">the great white from judgment will do</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="5.94">this some blue for heaven a great white</text>
  <text start="403.02" dur="6.27">throne judgment now this is what&amp;#39;s known</text>
  <text start="405.87" dur="5.36">as the second death and basically all</text>
  <text start="409.29" dur="4.92">the wicked at this point are now</text>
  <text start="411.23" dur="5.89">resurrected so there&amp;#39;s a second death</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="5.58">and anyone whose names are not written</text>
  <text start="417.12" dur="6.09">in the Lamb&amp;#39;s Book of Life are judged at</text>
  <text start="419.79" dur="4.53">the second death that&amp;#39;s why again bless</text>
  <text start="423.21" dur="3.36">it is huge part of the first</text>
  <text start="424.32" dur="3.57">resurrection okay because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="426.57" dur="3.27">gonna have any part in the second death</text>
  <text start="427.89" dur="4.86">now there are going to be some people</text>
  <text start="429.84" dur="4.89">who you know lived and died during the</text>
  <text start="432.75" dur="4.23">millennium or still alive didn&amp;#39;t Liam</text>
  <text start="434.73" dur="3.81">who did put their faith in Messiah okay</text>
  <text start="436.98" dur="3.12">and they&amp;#39;ll also because they were</text>

  <text start="440.1" dur="3.66">second death and a third names are found</text>
  <text start="442.02" dur="3.81">in the book of life they&amp;#39;ll get to go</text>

  <text start="445.83" dur="3.99">are that happened in the one Ian</text>
  <text start="447.03" dur="3.84">everyone that&amp;#39;s living right now okay</text>
  <text start="449.82" dur="3">either you&amp;#39;re going to be part of the</text>
  <text start="450.87" dur="4.86">first resurrection or it can be part of</text>
  <text start="452.82" dur="4.86">the second death unless you&amp;#39;re one of</text>
  <text start="455.73" dur="6">those few that survived but that&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="457.68" dur="5.73">wouldn&amp;#39;t trust in that at all because it</text>
  <text start="461.73" dur="4.29">says in Isaiah that a man&amp;#39;s gonna be as</text>
  <text start="463.41" dur="5.4">rare as a witch of gold at that point by</text>
  <text start="466.02" dur="3.93">the end of the Great Tribulation so at</text>
