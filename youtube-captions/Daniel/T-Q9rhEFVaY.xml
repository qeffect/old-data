  <text start="24.72" dur="4.92">verse so again if anyone has comments or</text>
  <text start="28.08" dur="4.35">questions just interrupt me while I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="41.55" dur="9.21">get yah who at sundry times and I&amp;#39;m in</text>
  <text start="46.739" dur="7.8">diverse manners spake in times past unto</text>
  <text start="50.76" dur="6.18">the father&amp;#39;s by the prophets half in</text>
  <text start="54.539" dur="5.281">these last days spoken unto us by his</text>
  <text start="56.94" dur="6.56">son whom he hath appointed heir of all</text>
  <text start="59.82" dur="6.63">things by whom also he made the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="63.5" dur="5.729">who being the brightness of his glory in</text>
  <text start="66.45" dur="5.4">the Express image of his person and</text>
  <text start="69.229" dur="5.741">upholding all things by the word of his</text>
  <text start="71.85" dur="6.48">power when he had by himself purged our</text>
  <text start="74.97" dur="8.07">sins sat down on the right hand of the</text>
  <text start="78.33" dur="7.41">Majesty on high hallelujah being made so</text>
  <text start="83.04" dur="4.14">much better than the Angels as he f&amp;#39;d by</text>
  <text start="85.74" dur="6.03">inheritance obtained a more excellent</text>
  <text start="87.18" dur="5.88">name the name so right here at the very</text>
  <text start="91.77" dur="4.559">beginning of Hebrews we just get a</text>
  <text start="93.06" dur="6.18">perfect beautiful picture of who Yahshua</text>
  <text start="96.329" dur="5.43">is I don&amp;#39;t know of a better description</text>
  <text start="99.24" dur="4.409">than what we see even in verse 3 s the</text>
  <text start="101.759" dur="5.851">brightness of the father&amp;#39;s glory he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="103.649" dur="5.701">the expressed image of ya&amp;#39;s person he</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="4.41">upholds all things by the word of his</text>
  <text start="109.35" dur="4.32">power when he and himself purged our</text>
  <text start="112.02" dur="3.84">sins he sat down the right hand of the</text>
  <text start="113.67" dur="4.049">Majesty on high being made so much</text>
  <text start="115.86" dur="3.96">better I mean he is the very expressed</text>
  <text start="117.719" dur="5.461">image of the person father so when</text>
  <text start="119.82" dur="5.009">people try to divide a god into three</text>
  <text start="123.18" dur="3.93">different persons or two tumors or</text>
  <text start="124.829" dur="4.861">whatever that&amp;#39;s not right because he is</text>
  <text start="127.11" dur="5.05">the Express image of the person of the</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="8.13">father the father of course is not</text>
  <text start="132.16" dur="8.73">the father is a spirit a colonel exists</text>
  <text start="137.82" dur="5.89">eternal uncreated spirit and the only</text>
  <text start="140.89" dur="4.77">way we can behold him in this realm is</text>
  <text start="143.71" dur="4.68">through Yahshua Josh was the image of</text>
  <text start="145.66" dur="7.56">him Josh was the very center of the</text>
  <text start="148.39" dur="6.75">Father and when it says he sat on the</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="3.72">right hand of the Majesty on high that</text>
  <text start="155.14" dur="4.35">some well there&amp;#39;s a lot of different</text>
  <text start="156.94" dur="4.77">meanings to that first of all the right</text>
  <text start="159.49" dur="4.74">hand of the Father is his right hand of</text>
  <text start="161.71" dur="6.8">mercy left hand of judgment right hand</text>
  <text start="164.23" dur="6.9">of mercy so Yahshua represents at least</text>
  <text start="168.51" dur="5.23">he has so far represented the mercy of</text>
  <text start="171.13" dur="5.7">the Father because we&amp;#39;ve all deserved to</text>
  <text start="173.74" dur="5.79">come under the wrath of of yah but that</text>
  <text start="176.83" dur="9.21">aspect of yadah manifests as Yahshua</text>
  <text start="179.53" dur="9.51">extends us mercy if we repent but and if</text>
  <text start="186.04" dur="4.5">you think about it yeah also represents</text>
  <text start="189.04" dur="3.63">the left hand of the father as well</text>
  <text start="190.54" dur="5.1">because he will come in judgment again</text>
  <text start="192.67" dur="4.56">so he&amp;#39;s sort of symbolic of that right</text>
  <text start="195.64" dur="3.96">hand of mercy right now but he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="197.23" dur="4.83">to come he&amp;#39;s going to come in judgment</text>
  <text start="199.6" dur="4.29">as well being made so much better than</text>
  <text start="202.06" dur="6.29">the Angels as he had my inheritance</text>
  <text start="203.89" dur="8.85">obtained a more excellent name than they</text>
  <text start="208.35" dur="6.67">so he was made so much better than the</text>
  <text start="212.74" dur="3.719">Angels because he first of all he was</text>
  <text start="215.02" dur="4.17">lowered beneath the Angels because he</text>
  <text start="216.459" dur="4.471">became a human that was the image in</text>
  <text start="219.19" dur="5.01">which we could behold the father was</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="5.58">Yahshua and yet he&amp;#39;s obtained an</text>
  <text start="224.2" dur="6.63">inheritance better than the Angels</text>
  <text start="226.51" dur="8.19">because you know the Angels the angels</text>
  <text start="230.83" dur="5.85">are all before the father and like</text>
  <text start="234.7" dur="4.23">Lucifer and the fallen angels when they</text>
  <text start="236.68" dur="3.93">turned away from the father they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="238.93" dur="3.45">have any chance of redemption there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="240.61" dur="4.17">way for them to repent because they</text>
  <text start="242.38" dur="4.859">beheld the fullness of who you is and</text>
  <text start="244.78" dur="3.66">yet they&amp;#39;ve chosen to reject who ya is</text>
  <text start="247.239" dur="4.021">and they there&amp;#39;s no way from the de</text>
  <text start="248.44" dur="4.08">repente but humans we have the ability</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="5.13">to repent because we haven&amp;#39;t seen the</text>
  <text start="252.52" dur="5.67">fullness of yah and the reason why we</text>
  <text start="256.39" dur="3.81">have that ability to repent is because</text>
  <text start="258.19" dur="5.89">Yahshua he is man he humbled himself</text>
  <text start="260.2" dur="6.489">enough to manifest himself as</text>
  <text start="264.08" dur="4.709">human on earth he of course atone for</text>
  <text start="266.689" dur="4.771">our sins shed his blood but he</text>
  <text start="268.789" dur="6.961">manifested an aspect of Yabut we humans</text>
  <text start="271.46" dur="6.9">had never seen before and that is that</text>
  <text start="275.75" dur="3.93">he became like us just like us tempted</text>
  <text start="278.36" dur="2.97">with everything that we&amp;#39;re tempted with</text>
  <text start="279.68" dur="4.53">put through all the trials that were put</text>
  <text start="281.33" dur="5.549">through and yet he never sinned once he</text>
  <text start="284.21" dur="5.88">always he always always remained</text>
  <text start="286.879" dur="7.53">steadfast in love with with his father</text>
  <text start="290.09" dur="6.96">and he was the perfect example and so he</text>
  <text start="294.409" dur="5.341">was able to help us see a new aspect of</text>
  <text start="297.05" dur="4.29">who he is which enables the which causes</text>
  <text start="299.75" dur="4.86">our hearts to break cause our hearts to</text>
  <text start="301.34" dur="6.449">surrendered in and and were able to to</text>
  <text start="304.61" dur="4.98">repent and so he&amp;#39;s obtained a much</text>
  <text start="307.789" dur="3.331">better inheritance than these angels</text>
  <text start="309.59" dur="3.509">because he has actually done something</text>
  <text start="311.12" dur="3.84">that that really can&amp;#39;t be done in the</text>
  <text start="313.099" dur="6.06">angelic realm he&amp;#39;s come down and He shed</text>
  <text start="314.96" dur="5.91">his blood for us a spirit being became</text>
  <text start="319.159" dur="6.181">flesh and shed his blood for us and that</text>
  <text start="320.87" dur="6.75">is incredibly awesome for under which of</text>
  <text start="325.34" dur="4.949">the angel said he at any time you were</text>
  <text start="327.62" dur="5.669">my son this day have I begotten you and</text>
  <text start="330.289" dur="6.81">again I will be to him a father and he</text>
  <text start="333.289" dur="5.611">shall be to me a son and again when he</text>
  <text start="337.099" dur="3.901">brings in the first begotten under the</text>
  <text start="338.9" dur="6.12">world he says and let all the angels of</text>
  <text start="341" dur="7.259">yah worship Him okay so now we see that</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="4.59">Yahshua is above the Angels why because</text>
  <text start="348.259" dur="3.301">all the angels will worship Him now</text>
  <text start="349.61" dur="4.049">we&amp;#39;re not allowed to worship any angels</text>
  <text start="351.56" dur="5.37">at all in fact there&amp;#39;s many warnings</text>
  <text start="353.659" dur="5.281">against that like in Revelation where</text>
  <text start="356.93" dur="3.72">John pulled on his face angel says no</text>
  <text start="358.94" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t worship me see about do it not I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="360.65" dur="4.889">your fellow servant but we see that</text>
  <text start="362.75" dur="4.71">Yahshua all the angels worship Him why</text>
  <text start="365.539" dur="5.671">because Yahshua is the very person of</text>
  <text start="367.46" dur="5.129">yacht and if the angels he says who</text>
  <text start="371.21" dur="3.959">makes his angels spirits and his</text>
  <text start="372.589" dur="5.841">ministers a flame of fire but under the</text>
  <text start="375.169" dur="7.701">Sun he says your throne oh yah is</text>
  <text start="378.43" dur="7.479">forever a scepter of righteousness is</text>
  <text start="382.87" dur="6.579">the scepter of your kingdom right here</text>
  <text start="385.909" dur="4.861">in verse 8 is the ultimate proof one of</text>
  <text start="389.449" dur="3.59">the ultimate proofs but one of the best</text>
  <text start="390.77" dur="5.67">ultimate groups to prove that the Sun is</text>
  <text start="393.039" dur="4.21">Yahweh because Yahweh is speaking and</text>
  <text start="396.44" dur="5.819">says under this</text>
  <text start="397.249" dur="6.9">Yahweh says your throne o yah is forever</text>
  <text start="402.259" dur="3.81">never accept your righteous is a scepter</text>
  <text start="404.149" dur="6.69">of your kingdom so right there we have</text>
  <text start="406.069" dur="8.04">proof Yahweh calls Yahshua yeah yes he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.839" dur="6.14">talking to himself you have loved</text>
  <text start="414.109" dur="5.4">righteousness and hated iniquity</text>
  <text start="416.979" dur="6.64">therefore yawn Eva daya hath anointed</text>
  <text start="419.509" dur="8.66">thee with the oil of gladness above your</text>
  <text start="423.619" dur="7.5">fellows hallelujah Yahshua as a human</text>
  <text start="428.169" dur="4.81">know it when he was a human we tend to</text>
  <text start="431.119" dur="4.47">think our people tend to think that oh</text>
  <text start="432.979" dur="3.81">he was just it was the superhuman that</text>
  <text start="435.589" dur="4.35">was just greater than all of us and</text>
  <text start="436.789" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s why he didn&amp;#39;t sin no no when it</text>
  <text start="439.939" dur="2.94">means one yet when it says that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="441.319" dur="3.72">humbled himself and became like a man</text>
  <text start="442.879" dur="4.83">that means he had only what was</text>
  <text start="445.039" dur="4.67">available to all of us that&amp;#39;s all he had</text>
  <text start="447.709" dur="7.5">he was stripped of everything else and</text>
  <text start="449.709" dur="11.05">yet he chose never to sin never to sin</text>
  <text start="455.209" dur="7.62">once he chose always a love yah and he</text>
  <text start="460.759" dur="6.39">even went above and beyond living a</text>
  <text start="462.829" dur="8.45">righteous life because he died for</text>
  <text start="467.149" dur="7.83">people who hated him who were selfish</text>
  <text start="471.279" dur="6.581">okay and if you&amp;#39;ll be hard-pressed to</text>
  <text start="474.979" dur="4.381">find even a righteous man who&amp;#39;s falling</text>
  <text start="477.86" dur="4.949">all the commands who will do such a</text>
  <text start="479.36" dur="5.909">thing it almost seems insane again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="482.809" dur="8.4">actually the ultimate act of love and he</text>
  <text start="485.269" dur="8.01">did that hallelujah hallelujah and it</text>
  <text start="491.209" dur="4.11">wasn&amp;#39;t just that one act either when he</text>
  <text start="493.279" dur="4.29">died on the cross because we know in our</text>
  <text start="495.319" dur="3.81">own personal walks that even when we</text>
  <text start="497.569" dur="3.36">were selfish we were wicked we were</text>
  <text start="499.129" dur="3.42">fighting against y&amp;#39;all running off in</text>
  <text start="500.929" dur="4.07">the direction he was divinely</text>
  <text start="502.549" dur="5.3">orchestrating events to bring us to him</text>
  <text start="504.999" dur="6.01">loving us while we still hated him</text>
  <text start="507.849" dur="6.25">hallelujah may we have that love in our</text>
  <text start="511.009" dur="5.25">hearts so because Joshua did that</text>
  <text start="514.099" dur="3.57">because he hated iniquity he hated all</text>
  <text start="516.259" dur="4.981">sin he hated everything that was against</text>
  <text start="517.669" dur="4.77">the Torah and he loved righteousness yah</text>
  <text start="521.24" dur="3.87">has anointed him with the oil of</text>
  <text start="522.439" dur="4.881">gladness above his fellows no angel has</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="5.15">ever done what Yahshua&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="527.32" dur="5.34">and thou Lord in the beginning has laid</text>
  <text start="530.26" dur="4.68">the foundation of the earth and the</text>
  <text start="532.66" dur="5.28">heavens are the works of your hands so</text>
  <text start="534.94" dur="4.47">again this man Yahshua was also the Lord</text>
  <text start="537.94" dur="3.72">for the beginning who laid the</text>
  <text start="539.41" dur="4.23">foundation of the earth who sue who put</text>
  <text start="541.66" dur="3.54">the stars in their place who created the</text>
  <text start="543.64" dur="5.16">heavens in the earth which of course we</text>
  <text start="545.2" dur="5.34">know from john chapter 1 as well they</text>
  <text start="548.8" dur="3.83">shall all perish referring to the</text>
  <text start="550.54" dur="5.01">heavens in the earth but you remain yeah</text>
  <text start="552.63" dur="6.13">and they all shall wax cold as death a</text>
  <text start="555.55" dur="5.34">garment and as a vesture or is a piece</text>
  <text start="558.76" dur="4.35">of clothing shall you fold them up and</text>
  <text start="560.89" dur="5.25">they shall be changed but you are the</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="4.59">same and your years shall not fall so</text>
  <text start="566.14" dur="2.97">even though the heavens and earth will</text>
  <text start="567.7" dur="3.03">pass away and they&amp;#39;ll be changed like a</text>
  <text start="569.11" dur="3.36">garment like if you took off your old</text>
  <text start="570.73" dur="3.81">clothes and put on new clothes and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="572.47" dur="4.32">get the new heavens and new earth these</text>
  <text start="574.54" dur="5.34">things come and go and yet yah will</text>
  <text start="576.79" dur="7.68">never come and go he&amp;#39;s always there he</text>
  <text start="579.88" dur="7.65">was is and is to come but to which of</text>
  <text start="584.47" dur="4.95">the angel said he at any time sit on my</text>
  <text start="587.53" dur="5.49">right hand until I make your enemies</text>
  <text start="589.42" dur="6.06">your footstool and of course he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="593.02" dur="4.59">say that any angel that&amp;#39;s why any</text>
  <text start="595.48" dur="4.41">religion or theology that teaches that</text>
  <text start="597.61" dur="3.78">you know Michael the Archangel is Joshua</text>
  <text start="599.89" dur="3.39">or Gabriel or anything like that in fact</text>
  <text start="601.39" dur="4.35">I just learned a couple of months ago</text>
  <text start="603.28" dur="4.17">from someone that the SDA church teaches</text>
  <text start="605.74" dur="3.84">that that Michael is Yahshua and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="607.45" dur="4.86">utter blasphemy its wickedness and</text>
  <text start="609.58" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s thoroughly disproven here in</text>
  <text start="612.31" dur="3.93">Hebrews 1 there&amp;#39;s not a single angel the</text>
  <text start="614.77" dur="2.7">yah has ever said sit at my right hand</text>
  <text start="616.24" dur="6.03">until I make your enemies your footstool</text>
  <text start="617.47" dur="6.33">except Yahshua Yahshua is young are they</text>
  <text start="622.27" dur="3.33">not all ministering spirits sent forth</text>
  <text start="623.8" dur="3.87">to minister to them who shall be heirs</text>
  <text start="625.6" dur="4.26">of salvation so we see the purpose of</text>
  <text start="627.67" dur="3.75">the angels the angels are ministering</text>
  <text start="629.86" dur="3.6">spirits at least those that have not</text>
  <text start="631.42" dur="5.34">fallen the true angels are sent to</text>
  <text start="633.46" dur="5.34">minister to the heirs of salvation or</text>
  <text start="636.76" dur="4.35">the heirs of salvation all those who</text>

  <text start="732.34" dur="5.97">poured out in mass upon his people which</text>
  <text start="735.37" dur="5.1">hadn&amp;#39;t been seen before in in the tanakh</text>
  <text start="738.31" dur="3.9">and the old so-called Old Testament you</text>

  <text start="746.05" dur="5.07">a large group of people like you do in</text>
  <text start="748" dur="5.28">the renewed covenant and so now we see</text>
  <text start="751.12" dur="4.62">just the greatest the ultimate witness</text>

  <text start="761.65" dur="4.95">that was detailed in first Corinthians</text>
  <text start="763.63" dur="5.46">chapter 9 and and the author here Paul</text>
  <text start="766.6" dur="5.04">is basically saying look if even the</text>
  <text start="769.09" dur="4.53">Torah which you didn&amp;#39;t really see the</text>
  <text start="771.64" dur="4.62">operation of the Spirit in mass a lot of</text>

  <text start="776.26" dur="4.92">how much more does the fullness of the</text>

  <text start="781.18" dur="4.89">poured out on so many people how could</text>
  <text start="783.37" dur="4.5">we ever neglect that because it&amp;#39;s a much</text>
  <text start="786.07" dur="3.18">it&amp;#39;s a much it&amp;#39;s much much more full</text>
  <text start="787.87" dur="4.97">it&amp;#39;s a much more fullness of who he is</text>

  <text start="810.5" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s like when Abraham did not was not</text>

  <text start="829.43" dur="5.25">salvation which are us and that&amp;#39;s why it</text>
  <text start="832.82" dur="3.63">says in first Corinthians 6 where Paul</text>
  <text start="834.68" dur="3.54">says we&amp;#39;re going to even judge the</text>
  <text start="836.45" dur="5.49">angels we&amp;#39;re going to even judge the</text>

  <text start="894.05" dur="4.53">subjection under his feet for that he</text>
  <text start="896.45" dur="5.28">put all the subjection under him he left</text>
  <text start="898.58" dur="5.22">nothing that is not put under him but</text>
  <text start="901.73" dur="5.64">now we see that not yet all things are</text>
  <text start="903.8" dur="5.49">put under him so with purpose one of the</text>
  <text start="907.37" dur="5.67">purposes of Yahshua coming to the earth</text>
  <text start="909.29" dur="5.58">was not to just shed his blood and atone</text>
  <text start="913.04" dur="3.81">for our sins or even just to show us how</text>
  <text start="914.87" dur="3.84">to live although those are very very</text>
  <text start="916.85" dur="4.92">needful things and very important things</text>
  <text start="918.71" dur="5.13">but also that what he&amp;#39;s doing is he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="921.77" dur="4.42">stripping away the power that was given</text>
  <text start="923.84" dur="4.57">to Satan when Adam and he fell</text>
  <text start="926.19" dur="3.48">and he hasn&amp;#39;t quite done all that yet</text>
  <text start="928.41" dur="3.87">because like we&amp;#39;re going to read a</text>
  <text start="929.67" dur="4.02">little later in Hebrews death has still</text>
  <text start="932.28" dur="3.57">not yet been put under his feet because</text>
  <text start="933.69" dur="4.65">we still see people dying there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="935.85" dur="4.47">a curse on this earth but because of</text>
  <text start="938.34" dur="3.84">what Yahshua did all things will</text>
  <text start="940.32" dur="4.71">eventually be put under his feet</text>
  <text start="942.18" dur="7.22">everything and that&amp;#39;s fulfilled in the</text>
  <text start="945.03" dur="7.8">book of Revelation but we see Yahshua</text>
  <text start="949.4" dur="4.72">pig Evan in verse 9 but we see Yahshua</text>
  <text start="952.83" dur="3.41">who is made a little lower than the</text>
  <text start="954.12" dur="6.21">Angels for the suffering of death</text>
  <text start="956.24" dur="6.3">crowned with glory and honor that he by</text>
  <text start="960.33" dur="8.43">the grace of yah should taste death for</text>

  <text start="968.76" dur="7.59">penalty of breaking the Torah is death</text>
  <text start="971.27" dur="7.06">that penalty has to be fulfilled and so</text>
  <text start="976.35" dur="3.6">that yah would not lose everyone to</text>
  <text start="978.33" dur="4.2">death because we all deserve that we all</text>
  <text start="979.95" dur="4.77">deserve eternal death yah himself tasted</text>
  <text start="982.53" dur="5.04">that and we have to understand it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="984.72" dur="5.25">that Yahshua simply tasted death like in</text>
  <text start="987.57" dur="4.41">the physical sense it says he took up on</text>
  <text start="989.97" dur="5.64">sim so when says he tasted death he</text>
  <text start="991.98" dur="5.46">tasted spiritual death which is what we</text>
  <text start="995.61" dur="4.71">all deserve so and this why he cried out</text>
  <text start="997.44" dur="6.05">in brokenness on the street he said</text>
  <text start="1000.32" dur="5.64">father father why have you forsaken me</text>
  <text start="1003.49" dur="6.01">it was literally like a man who&amp;#39;d been</text>
  <text start="1005.96" dur="6.21">totally abandoned by yah and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1009.5" dur="5.66">he went through for us that that that</text>
  <text start="1012.17" dur="2.99">should blow us away</text>
  <text start="1016.88" dur="6.519">verse 10 for it became him for whom are</text>
  <text start="1020.88" dur="5.699">all things and by whom are all things in</text>

  <text start="1033.72" dur="4.92">became perfect through sufferings and as</text>
  <text start="1036.809" dur="4.53">we follow him in his sufferings we</text>
  <text start="1038.64" dur="4.22">become perfect as well and the other</text>
  <text start="1041.339" dur="4.11">thing I want to point out here is that</text>
  <text start="1042.86" dur="4.179">notice how in verse 9 it says he tasted</text>
  <text start="1045.449" dur="4.321">death for every man in other words he</text>
  <text start="1047.039" dur="5.221">took upon the weight of sin so that any</text>
  <text start="1049.77" dur="6.21">man any man on earth that&amp;#39;s ever lived</text>
  <text start="1052.26" dur="5.97">could have the opportunity okay to be</text>
  <text start="1055.98" dur="3.9">absolved with their sins but here in</text>
  <text start="1058.23" dur="2.88">verse 10 we see that even though that</text>
  <text start="1059.88" dur="4.799">opportunity has been given to every man</text>
  <text start="1061.11" dur="5.34">it says in bringing many sons unto glory</text>
  <text start="1064.679" dur="4.11">that means there will be many who will</text>
  <text start="1066.45" dur="8.19">be brought unto him and glorified but</text>
  <text start="1068.789" dur="8.311">not all so the the atonement was made</text>
  <text start="1074.64" dur="7.47">available to everyone but the result is</text>
  <text start="1077.1" dur="7.62">many come not not everyone verse 11 for</text>

  <text start="1253.02" dur="3.68">through much more and it resisted it and</text>
  <text start="1254.88" dur="6.63">so his spirit can enable us to overcome</text>
  <text start="1256.7" dur="7.78">hallelujah for verily he Yahshua took on</text>
  <text start="1261.51" dur="5.13">him the nature took not on him the</text>
  <text start="1264.48" dur="3.39">nature of angels so would continue the</text>
  <text start="1266.64" dur="3.87">same thing he didn&amp;#39;t become like an</text>
  <text start="1267.87" dur="5.28">angel the spirit being but he took on in</text>
  <text start="1270.51" dur="5.73">the seed of Abraham he literally became</text>
  <text start="1273.15" dur="5.34">a man wherefore in all things that</text>
  <text start="1276.24" dur="2.97">behooved him to be made like unto his</text>
  <text start="1278.49" dur="4.059">brother</text>
  <text start="1279.21" dur="5.89">that he might be a merciful and faithful</text>
  <text start="1282.549" dur="5.941">high priest in things pertaining to yaw</text>
  <text start="1285.1" dur="5.76">to make reconciliation for the sins of</text>
  <text start="1288.49" dur="3.99">the people see if he had been an angel</text>
  <text start="1290.86" dur="4.65">he wouldn&amp;#39;t been able to become a high</text>
  <text start="1292.48" dur="4.53">priest the high priests if we look at</text>
  <text start="1295.51" dur="3.09">the tour the high priest was of course</text>
  <text start="1297.01" dur="3.63">from among the people from the tribe of</text>
  <text start="1298.6" dur="3.6">Levi and he would make an atonement for</text>
  <text start="1300.64" dur="4.35">himself and then we make atonement for</text>
  <text start="1302.2" dur="5.43">all the people okay so Yahshua had to</text>
  <text start="1304.99" dur="4.939">become it he had to come in the form of</text>
  <text start="1307.63" dur="5.37">this corruptible man basically an</text>
  <text start="1309.929" dur="5.411">incorruptible human flesh and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1313" dur="4.14">what he did and yet of course he never</text>
  <text start="1315.34" dur="3.87">sent so that he could make that so he</text>
  <text start="1317.14" dur="6.779">could bridge the gap between this holy</text>
  <text start="1319.21" dur="8.61">chicana a ever existing Yahweh and us</text>
  <text start="1323.919" dur="7.111">and this was the way Yahweh realized he</text>
  <text start="1327.82" dur="5.79">could bridge that gap by manifesting</text>
  <text start="1331.03" dur="5.22">himself as a man and making</text>
  <text start="1333.61" dur="3.9">reconciliation for us but he had to</text>
  <text start="1336.25" dur="3.169">become a man in order to become that</text>
  <text start="1337.51" dur="4.26">high priest and to be able to do that</text>
  <text start="1339.419" dur="5.531">foreign that he himself has suffered</text>
  <text start="1341.77" dur="6.3">being tempted he is able to succour or</text>
  <text start="1344.95" dur="6.21">to help them that are tempted verse 18</text>
  <text start="1348.07" dur="4.92">right here is the crown jewel okay the</text>
  <text start="1351.16" dur="5.04">theme thus far in these first few</text>
  <text start="1352.99" dur="4.8">chapters in fact if there&amp;#39;s one more</text>
  <text start="1356.2" dur="3.66">important verse anywhere in all the book</text>
  <text start="1357.79" dur="4.379">of Hebrews it&amp;#39;s right here for that he</text>
  <text start="1359.86" dur="4.68">himself has suffered being tempted he is</text>
  <text start="1362.169" dur="4.921">able to support or to help them better</text>
  <text start="1364.54" dur="4.74">tempted because he was in a flesh and</text>
  <text start="1367.09" dur="4.05">blood body he didn&amp;#39;t have anything more</text>
  <text start="1369.28" dur="4.38">than what we have access today in terms</text>
  <text start="1371.14" dur="4.38">of having a relationship with yah he</text>
  <text start="1373.66" dur="4.259">suffered being tempted he was tempted in</text>
  <text start="1375.52" dur="4.5">every way but we get tempted in every</text>
  <text start="1377.919" dur="4.021">way he was tempted to lust he was</text>
  <text start="1380.02" dur="3.42">tempted to to cheat and lie he was</text>
  <text start="1381.94" dur="3.51">tempted to hate his brother without a</text>
  <text start="1383.44" dur="6.21">cause he was tempted to do all these</text>
  <text start="1385.45" dur="7.17">sins and yet he never did and so because</text>
  <text start="1389.65" dur="6">of that he is able to send his spirit</text>
  <text start="1392.62" dur="5.22">into us and he can say oh yeah I know</text>
  <text start="1395.65" dur="4.2">that temptation guess what I can teach</text>
  <text start="1397.84" dur="5.37">you how to overcome that tissue cuz I</text>
  <text start="1399.85" dur="5.87">did it I did it 2,000 years ago and now</text>
  <text start="1403.21" dur="6.39">I&amp;#39;m gonna help you do it hallelujah</text>
  <text start="1405.72" dur="5.22">hallelujah this is how he was able to</text>
  <text start="1409.6" dur="2.54">bridge the gap</text>
  <text start="1410.94" dur="3.12">we&amp;#39;re going to stop with these first two</text>
  <text start="1412.14" dur="4.04">chapters but i want to emphasize how</text>
  <text start="1414.06" dur="6.51">important it is to understand the</text>
  <text start="1416.18" dur="7.12">yahushua became a total man a man just</text>
  <text start="1420.57" dur="6.24">like you and i and yet he was also the</text>
  <text start="1423.3" dur="5.16">very expressed image of yahweh these two</text>
  <text start="1426.81" dur="4.71">concepts are so important to understand</text>
  <text start="1428.46" dur="6.06">because it&amp;#39;s like some people go either</text>
  <text start="1431.52" dur="5.04">one extreme or the other or they say all</text>
  <text start="1434.52" dur="3.99">he was just a superhuman he was just it</text>
  <text start="1436.56" dur="4.49">was like God incarnate and just he</text>
  <text start="1438.51" dur="4.92">couldn&amp;#39;t send which is just ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1441.05" dur="4.9">because if he couldn&amp;#39;t send there was no</text>
  <text start="1443.43" dur="4.98">hope of him ever sinning and then there</text>
  <text start="1445.95" dur="3.87">was no virtue and resisting sin so yeah</text>
  <text start="1448.41" dur="4.74">he could have he became a man just like</text>
  <text start="1449.82" dur="7.53">it and yet he he was he was Yahweh</text>
  <text start="1453.15" dur="7.61">Yahweh who humbled himself and you know</text>
  <text start="1457.35" dur="9.03">this point is made very beautifully in</text>
  <text start="1460.76" dur="8.71">the book of Genesis when Abraham takes</text>
  <text start="1466.38" dur="5.94">his son Isaac up to Mount Moriah and you</text>
  <text start="1469.47" dur="7.56">read that story and it literally says</text>
  <text start="1472.32" dur="10.23">that Yahweh provided himself a lamb or</text>
  <text start="1477.03" dur="7.92">Ram prided himself a ram and you look at</text>
  <text start="1482.55" dur="5.46">those words in Genesis provided himself</text>
  <text start="1484.95" dur="5.16">a ram and you look at those words when</text>
  <text start="1488.01" dur="3.96">you read it and you read it and you read</text>
  <text start="1490.11" dur="5.07">it and all of a sudden those words take</text>
  <text start="1491.97" dur="8.25">on a new meaning provided himself a ram</text>
  <text start="1495.18" dur="7.71">Yahweh the eternal yah who was is and is</text>
  <text start="1500.22" dur="4.95">to come who&amp;#39;s always existed who&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="1502.89" dur="9.39">sinned who&amp;#39;s been an internal glory he</text>
  <text start="1505.17" dur="9.75">himself he himself became a man he</text>
  <text start="1512.28" dur="5.22">stepped off that throne and came down to</text>
  <text start="1514.92" dur="6.36">earth and became a lowly man like you</text>
  <text start="1517.5" dur="6.27">and me and was tempted and suffered and</text>
  <text start="1521.28" dur="6.09">was persecuted and yet he never once</text>
  <text start="1523.77" dur="6.8">sent ever he&amp;#39;s the only one who&amp;#39;s ever</text>
  <text start="1527.37" dur="6.75">been able to do that hallelujah</text>
  <text start="1530.57" dur="5.23">hallelujah and because of that and</text>
  <text start="1534.12" dur="3.75">because not only did he live righteous</text>
  <text start="1535.8" dur="4.2">but he went even beyond above and beyond</text>
  <text start="1537.87" dur="4.18">living righteous and then he died for</text>
  <text start="1540" dur="7.12">those who hated him</text>
  <text start="1542.05" dur="6.96">them you realize he said Father forgive</text>
  <text start="1547.12" dur="3.09">them for they know not what they do he</text>
  <text start="1549.01" dur="3.84">was extending a heart of love and</text>
  <text start="1550.21" dur="4.52">forgiveness even while he was being cut</text>
  <text start="1552.85" dur="4.38">off from the very presence of the Father</text>
  <text start="1554.73" dur="8.47">so he&amp;#39;s showing love even when he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1557.23" dur="7.97">being abandoned and being made sin only</text>
  <text start="1563.2" dur="6.54">yah could have done such a thing</text>
  <text start="1565.2" dur="6.49">hallelujah hallelujah and he is able to</text>
  <text start="1569.74" dur="4.83">help us resist all sin because he&amp;#39;s gone</text>
  <text start="1571.69" dur="6.54">through it and his spirit can always</text>
  <text start="1574.57" dur="9">always provide us a way out of every</text>
