  <text start="0.03" dur="4.979">shabbat shalom this is Daniel John Lee</text>
  <text start="2.55" dur="6.36">with Torah restoration ministries it is</text>
  <text start="5.009" dur="5.851">April the 30th 2016 the 4th Shabbat of</text>
  <text start="8.91" dur="4.05">the Hebrew Newsham it a year that</text>
  <text start="10.86" dur="4.529">started in early April and I just wanted</text>
  <text start="12.96" dur="6.479">to give a podcast about what I consider</text>
  <text start="15.389" dur="7.021">is the best Jesus or Yahshua movie ever</text>
  <text start="19.439" dur="5.281">made and there are you know some good</text>
  <text start="22.41" dur="3.84">ones out there like that miniseries of</text>
  <text start="24.72" dur="4.5">Jesus of Nazareth that was made back in</text>
  <text start="26.25" dur="6.059">the 70s but in my opinion this one that</text>
  <text start="29.22" dur="6.12">was released this past February in 2016</text>
  <text start="32.309" dur="4.981">is the best in fact it was released just</text>
  <text start="35.34" dur="4.26">in time for Purim for those of you who</text>
  <text start="37.29" dur="3.839">celebrated Purim it was released just</text>
  <text start="39.6" dur="5.31">around that time so it&amp;#39;s pretty awesome</text>
  <text start="41.129" dur="5.761">but this movie with Ralph Fiennes in</text>
  <text start="44.91" dur="4.53">fact they have a lot of big-name actors</text>
  <text start="46.89" dur="5.82">in this movie that are just exceptional</text>
  <text start="49.44" dur="4.529">acting but what&amp;#39;s unique about this</text>
  <text start="52.71" dur="2.82">movie is that rather than really</text>
  <text start="53.969" dur="3.061">charting the life of Yahshua which is</text>
  <text start="55.53" dur="4.799">pretty much what all the Jesus other</text>
  <text start="57.03" dur="6.48">Jesus movies are about this one charts</text>
  <text start="60.329" dur="6.991">it basically starts at his death and</text>
  <text start="63.51" dur="6.42">then goes through the the 40 or so days</text>
  <text start="67.32" dur="5.79">between his resurrection and ascension</text>
  <text start="69.93" dur="5.79">to when he is when he of course ascends</text>
  <text start="73.11" dur="4.649">for the last time up to the heavens 10</text>
  <text start="75.72" dur="4.5">days prior to Shavo or Pentecost when</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="4.29">the Ruach comes down and so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="80.22" dur="3.36">that&amp;#39;s unique in and of itself but the</text>
  <text start="82.049" dur="3.18">main character is not one of the</text>
  <text start="83.58" dur="3.469">disciples or Yahshua himself the main</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="4.89">character of course is this Roman</text>
  <text start="87.049" dur="5.89">centurion or general who basically is in</text>
  <text start="90.119" dur="6.901">charge of the two Roman centurion guards</text>
  <text start="92.939" dur="6.331">that guard the tomb and it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="5.19">incredible film there are scenes in this</text>
  <text start="99.27" dur="4.83">film that just wrench your heart and</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="4.229">break it and you start weeping I mean it</text>
  <text start="104.1" dur="4.74">is incredible and I don&amp;#39;t want to give</text>
  <text start="106.439" dur="4.531">away a lot of what happens but I will</text>
  <text start="108.84" dur="3.809">just highlight one scene which you know</text>
  <text start="110.97" dur="3.509">for any of you who&amp;#39;ve read the Gospels</text>
  <text start="112.649" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;re familiar with the scene where you</text>
  <text start="114.479" dur="3.24">know after Yasha was already resurrected</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="3.991">and the disciples have actual already</text>
  <text start="117.719" dur="4.83">seen him a couple times one of the last</text>
  <text start="120.36" dur="3.75">times they see him is on the Sea of</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="3.301">Galilee when they&amp;#39;re out fishing and</text>
  <text start="124.11" dur="3.78">they can&amp;#39;t catch any fish and then they</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="3.48">see someone on the shore of the Galilee</text>
  <text start="127.89" dur="3.78">that calls out to them and says throw</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="3.44">your net on the other side and of course</text>
  <text start="131.67" dur="3.26">as they do and they</text>
  <text start="132.77" dur="5.16">they catch all this huge amount of fish</text>
  <text start="134.93" dur="4.65">153 fish it instantly reminds Jochen on</text>
  <text start="137.93" dur="5.22">the apostle of what had happened</text>
  <text start="139.58" dur="4.95">previously when Lyn Yahshua done that</text>
  <text start="143.15" dur="3.54">and so immediately yoga Don said it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="146.69" dur="5.94">its Yahshua and in in in the scene of</text>
  <text start="150.05" dur="4.35">the movie Peter he just he jumps out of</text>
  <text start="152.63" dur="4.23">the boat starts running splashing water</text>
  <text start="154.4" dur="4.23">running toward Yahshua he&amp;#39;s yelling yeah</text>
  <text start="156.86" dur="3.27">she won and all the disciples start</text>
  <text start="158.63" dur="3.51">clamoring I was voting right and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.13" dur="3.63">just the scene with the with the with</text>
  <text start="162.14" dur="3.12">the water flying and the disciples</text>

  <text start="179.69" dur="3.21">not you know one problem with some</text>
  <text start="181.58" dur="3.54">Christian movies is they tend to be</text>
  <text start="182.9" dur="4.8">cheesy or low-budget this is neither it</text>
  <text start="185.12" dur="6.18">is high budget it&amp;#39;s definitely an a</text>
  <text start="187.7" dur="6.24">movie with a-list actors very very well</text>

  <text start="196.55" dur="5.31">fascinating look at at this view of this</text>

  <text start="201.86" dur="4.77">as this complete you know hard-nosed</text>
  <text start="204.26" dur="4.38">skeptic and by the end of the movie of</text>
  <text start="206.63" dur="4.86">course he&amp;#39;s as hard as broken and he has</text>
  <text start="208.64" dur="4.71">falls in love with Yahshua but I just</text>
  <text start="211.49" dur="3.39">highly recommend this movie it came out</text>
