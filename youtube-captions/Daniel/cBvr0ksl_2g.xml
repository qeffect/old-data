  <text start="106.34" dur="5.76">giving of the spirit what does the</text>
  <text start="108.68" dur="6.119">spirit do we know from Paul&amp;#39;s books that</text>
  <text start="112.1" dur="5.76">the spirit gives us gifts to edify the</text>
  <text start="114.799" dur="5.82">body right we know also the spirit</text>

  <text start="122.42" dur="4.05">those to try to bring them into the body</text>
  <text start="123.97" dur="4.149">but here&amp;#39;s something that we don&amp;#39;t hear</text>
  <text start="126.47" dur="6.11">a lot about what the Holy Spirit does</text>
  <text start="128.119" dur="7.061">and that is going to be in Ezekiel</text>
  <text start="132.58" dur="6.01">chapter 36</text>
  <text start="135.18" dur="3.41">verse 27</text>
  <text start="142.78" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re so I&amp;#39;ll start in verse 25 Zika</text>
  <text start="146.62" dur="4.38">is prophesying at this point about the</text>
  <text start="148.15" dur="4.68">New Covenant says then why sprinkle</text>
  <text start="151" dur="4.41">clean water upon you and you shall be</text>
  <text start="152.83" dur="3.989">clean from all your filthiness and from</text>
  <text start="155.41" dur="3.78">all your idols and I would cleanse you</text>
  <text start="156.819" dur="4.861">and a new heart also while I give you</text>
  <text start="159.19" dur="4.83">and a new spirit while I put within you</text>
  <text start="161.68" dur="3.99">and I will take the stony heart out of</text>
  <text start="164.02" dur="4.5">your flesh and I will give you a heart</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="5.7">of flesh and I will put my spirit within</text>
  <text start="168.52" dur="5.969">you and cause you to walk in my statutes</text>
  <text start="171.37" dur="6.47">and you shall keep my judgments and do</text>
  <text start="174.489" dur="6.571">them so the purpose of His Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="177.84" dur="5.619">is to help us to live holy it&amp;#39;s to help</text>
  <text start="181.06" dur="5.55">us to guide us to obey the instructions</text>
  <text start="183.459" dur="5.491">in this book to obey His statutes and</text>
  <text start="186.61" dur="4.2">his judgments and its precepts and to do</text>
  <text start="188.95" dur="3.78">these things now that doesn&amp;#39;t mean when</text>
  <text start="190.81" dur="5.25">we get Phil the Holy Spirit all of a</text>
  <text start="192.73" dur="5.61">sudden we know all this stuff no but it</text>
  <text start="196.06" dur="4.14">means that when his spirit fills us we</text>
  <text start="198.34" dur="3.149">start reading his word we start seeing</text>
  <text start="200.2" dur="2.94">these things that we need to start doing</text>
  <text start="201.489" dur="3.75">and we start putting those things in</text>
  <text start="203.14" dur="4.05">place in our life the spirit begins to</text>
  <text start="205.239" dur="4.861">convict us and show us and transform us</text>
  <text start="207.19" dur="6.15">and of course look I&amp;#39;ve been I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="210.1" dur="5.1">walking in the Torah since 2001 and I</text>
  <text start="213.34" dur="3.61">still don&amp;#39;t know all this stuff it just</text>
  <text start="215.2" dur="4.899">goes on and on and on</text>
  <text start="216.95" dur="4.98">on and on and I think that for eternity</text>
  <text start="220.099" dur="3.301">future we&amp;#39;re going to be learning more</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="3.449">and more about who he is and being</text>
  <text start="223.4" dur="3.27">transformed into his image even when I</text>
  <text start="225.379" dur="5.911">resurrect the bodies because he is</text>
  <text start="226.67" dur="6.78">infinite we&amp;#39;re just finite but his</text>
  <text start="231.29" dur="6.51">spirit teaches us his ways his</text>
  <text start="233.45" dur="5.759">commandments is his blessings and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.8" dur="4.11">what shadow it&amp;#39;s all about it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="239.209" dur="5.521">the giving of his word his Commandments</text>
  <text start="241.91" dur="5.159">and it&amp;#39;s about the giving of a spirit if</text>
  <text start="244.73" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re just centered on the spirit then</text>
  <text start="247.069" dur="4.681">we can get lost we can get this we can</text>
  <text start="249.23" dur="3.9">get into all sorts of crazy strange fire</text>
  <text start="251.75" dur="3.9">type stuff because we don&amp;#39;t have his</text>
  <text start="253.13" dur="5.669">word to anger us if we only get into his</text>
  <text start="255.65" dur="6.059">word would become dry dead because</text>
  <text start="258.799" dur="4.501">there&amp;#39;s no spirit there we need both and</text>
  <text start="261.709" dur="4.971">that&amp;#39;s what shadow it&amp;#39;s all about that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.3" dur="3.38">what Pentecost is all about</text>
  <text start="271.83" dur="3.41">the spirit in the Torah</text>
  <text start="275.27" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;re both they&amp;#39;re both essential to</text>
  <text start="277.55" dur="7.11">our lives when we walk in his gifts we</text>
  <text start="282.11" dur="4.86">walk in a spirit we should be praying</text>
  <text start="284.66" dur="4.59">more and more for greater baptisms of</text>
  <text start="286.97" dur="4.47">the Spirit render baptisms of this fire</text>
  <text start="289.25" dur="3.75">but we should also be praying more and</text>
  <text start="291.44" dur="3.3">more that we can understand his word and</text>
