  <text start="16.199" dur="4.681">sexual perversion I mean sex outside of</text>
  <text start="18.539" dur="3.961">marriage and now homosexuality is</text>
  <text start="20.88" dur="5.13">basically leaving all of us to this</text>
  <text start="22.5" dur="6.21">child pedophilia okay and accepting it</text>
  <text start="26.01" dur="6.24">as something that you know is okay or</text>
  <text start="28.71" dur="6.3">fine although I I&amp;#39;m hoping and praying</text>
  <text start="32.25" dur="4.35">that with the child pedophilia finally</text>
  <text start="35.01" dur="4.799">will be enough for the American people</text>
  <text start="36.6" dur="9.42">to say whoa we can&amp;#39;t do this we can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="39.809" dur="8.371">this my question for you is do you see</text>
  <text start="46.02" dur="5.789">from your perspective and here in San</text>
  <text start="48.18" dur="6.96">Diego do you see that there is a rising</text>
  <text start="51.809" dur="5.371">awareness and an outrage or do you see</text>
  <text start="55.14" dur="3.66">that this pedophilia is just being</text>
  <text start="57.18" dur="3.42">accepted and it&amp;#39;s just continuing to get</text>
  <text start="58.8" dur="4.59">worse or what what are your thoughts on</text>
  <text start="60.6" dur="4.86">that well one only has to spend a little</text>
  <text start="63.39" dur="5.78">time on YouTube to realize it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="65.46" dur="6.839">exposed and I think more so with the</text>
  <text start="69.17" dur="5.14">with social media than it is than it has</text>
  <text start="72.299" dur="4.101">been in the past and I think we have</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="5.599">people like yourself out there exposing</text>
  <text start="76.4" dur="5.89">what it really is and now you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="79.909" dur="5.081">Washington DC to thing for a lot of that</text>

  <text start="84.99" dur="4.94">listed as pedophilia you know our</text>
  <text start="86.909" dur="6.931">politicians and there&amp;#39;s been several</text>
  <text start="89.93" dur="5.29">people on social media talking about the</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="3.72">crimes these people have committed you</text>
  <text start="95.22" dur="7.41">know you hear a lot of accusations and</text>
  <text start="97.56" dur="7.86">you see or copies the indictments that</text>
  <text start="102.63" dur="5.73">might be coming down some of their</text>
  <text start="105.42" dur="5.46">crimes in you know when you talk about</text>

  <text start="121.649" dur="4.561">know you&amp;#39;re some individuals like that</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="5.131">being exposed to social media I say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.21" dur="3.579">more of awareness today yeah</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="3.459">Holly I</text>
  <text start="129.789" dur="5.101">I agree with you on that so I want you</text>
  <text start="132.069" dur="4.89">to talk a little bit more about how they</text>
  <text start="134.89" dur="4.62">would try to portray pedophiles as these</text>
  <text start="136.959" dur="4.53">crazy wild haired people blah blah blah</text>
  <text start="139.51" dur="3.089">they&amp;#39;re on the fringes of society but</text>
  <text start="141.489" dur="2.941">when we were speaking earlier before</text>
  <text start="142.599" dur="3.39">this interview you were brought the</text>
  <text start="144.43" dur="4.38">point about how a lot of these</text>
  <text start="145.989" dur="5.131">pedophiles look very very nice you talk</text>
  <text start="148.81" dur="6.599">about a little bit more about that might</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="7.14">I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of sheeps out</text>
  <text start="155.409" dur="4.261">there and there&amp;#39;s all a lot of wolves in</text>
  <text start="158.26" dur="3.509">sheep&amp;#39;s clothing out there and</text>
  <text start="159.67" dur="4.679">Hollywood&amp;#39;s no exception if you look at</text>
  <text start="161.769" dur="6.321">who has recently been indicted in</text>
  <text start="164.349" dur="6.84">Hollywood and some of the crimes that</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="6.16">they&amp;#39;ve been accused of not necessarily</text>
  <text start="171.189" dur="4.741">convicted of yet and and what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.25" dur="5.28">the awareness happening in Hollywood now</text>
  <text start="175.93" dur="5.79">you have long term adults that were</text>
  <text start="179.53" dur="4.709">child actors coming out and pointing the</text>
  <text start="181.72" dur="4.32">fingers at the evildoers and because</text>
  <text start="184.239" dur="3.301">they&amp;#39;re doing that they&amp;#39;re being exposed</text>
  <text start="186.04" dur="3.509">and they&amp;#39;re very uncomfortable up there</text>
  <text start="187.54" dur="4.02">just two hours up the road from us right</text>
  <text start="189.549" dur="4.171">now right very uncomfortable out there</text>
  <text start="191.56" dur="4.679">and I think there&amp;#39;s a cleansing coming</text>
  <text start="193.72" dur="4.29">and I think you shouid has a lot to do</text>
  <text start="196.239" dur="5.67">with that amen amen</text>
  <text start="198.01" dur="6.3">okay yeah yeah so like even with the</text>

  <text start="204.31" dur="4.23">amen praise yah that&amp;#39;s what needs to</text>
  <text start="206.56" dur="3.419">happen so like with the example you</text>
  <text start="208.54" dur="2.939">brought up earlier hum about this guy</text>
  <text start="209.979" dur="3.48">that was in your Bible study group I</text>
  <text start="211.479" dur="3.451">mean he didn&amp;#39;t look like some person on</text>
  <text start="213.459" dur="3.601">the fringes of society he came as a</text>
  <text start="214.93" dur="4.919">well-dressed and I think I&amp;#39;d you know he</text>
  <text start="217.06" dur="4.41">was dressed in a suit right I had a</text>
  <text start="219.849" dur="2.88">jacket on most the time he just come</text>
  <text start="221.47" dur="4.259">from his University where he was</text>
  <text start="222.729" dur="5.281">employed as a technical guy but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="225.729" dur="6.15">Christian University is in the Riverside</text>
  <text start="228.01" dur="6.479">area so he shows up and he&amp;#39;s well</text>
  <text start="231.879" dur="6.36">behaved very articulate in his speech</text>
  <text start="234.489" dur="6.571">knows quite a bit about the word is very</text>
  <text start="238.239" dur="4.89">friendly to people but just the way he</text>
  <text start="241.06" dur="4.769">interacted and looked at that child</text>
  <text start="243.129" dur="4.92">right and to the training guy it stuck</text>
  <text start="245.829" dur="3.84">out as a red flag to me and I respected</text>
  <text start="248.049" dur="4.5">my wife the guy gives me the creeps</text>
  <text start="249.669" dur="4.59">yeah and little did I know we four</text>
  <text start="252.549" dur="3.481">months later I had to take myself off</text>
  <text start="254.259" dur="4.111">that case cuz I actually know all the</text>
  <text start="256.03" dur="4.59">players he was you know an accomplice in</text>

  <text start="260.62" dur="3.579">in Hollywood is that were made</text>
  <text start="262.34" dur="4.35">you make movies about pedophiles they</text>
  <text start="264.199" dur="4.591">portrayed them as these cooks who live</text>
  <text start="266.69" dur="5.22">on the fringes of society and I think</text>
  <text start="268.79" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s the liberabit because really a</text>
  <text start="271.91" dur="3.45">lot of these satanic pedophiles like</text>

  <text start="325.63" dur="5.02">and let me this reminds me of a story</text>
  <text start="328.789" dur="4.621">back in my young days when I was trained</text>
  <text start="330.65" dur="4.53">how to be a sex crimes detective this is</text>
  <text start="333.41" dur="3.84">interesting experiment and although I</text>
  <text start="335.18" dur="4.95">think it&amp;#39;s somewhat dated now they used</text>
  <text start="337.25" dur="5.37">to say okay assuming everybody was</text>
  <text start="340.13" dur="4.38">straight in the room okay keep that in</text>
  <text start="342.62" dur="3.33">mind all the women on this side of the</text>
  <text start="344.51" dur="3.659">room all the men on that side of the</text>
  <text start="345.95" dur="4.41">room and what they did was they had a</text>
  <text start="348.169" dur="3.87">third group and they said here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="350.36" dur="3.3">world we&amp;#39;re gonna rotate everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="352.039" dur="3.331">gonna have their turn at this but the</text>
  <text start="353.66" dur="5.24">guys in the middle and the gals in the</text>
  <text start="355.37" dur="7.65">middle that we want you to observe the</text>
  <text start="358.9" dur="5.739">nonverbal behavior of each group I had</text>
  <text start="363.02" dur="3.6">no idea what I was going to be doing so</text>
  <text start="364.639" dur="4.411">I had my pen and pen pencil out right</text>
  <text start="366.62" dur="4.35">and this illustrates a who illustrated</text>
  <text start="369.05" dur="5.04">at a young age to meet what was going on</text>
  <text start="370.97" dur="4.86">they would take a magazine and they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="374.09" dur="4.049">have the women on that side of the room</text>
  <text start="375.83" dur="4.649">they&amp;#39;d walk up to the first lady and go</text>
  <text start="378.139" dur="4.621">down the row of the magazine not showing</text>
  <text start="380.479" dur="4.351">everybody what what the magazine</text>
  <text start="382.76" dur="4.71">depicted okay they had it covered up</text>
  <text start="384.83" dur="4.08">they walked down about 12 women and he</text>
  <text start="387.47" dur="2.819">saw different reactions were sitting</text>
  <text start="388.91" dur="4.29">here okay I&amp;#39;m gonna write notes when</text>
  <text start="390.289" dur="4.861">number one did oh she she did that</text>
  <text start="393.2" dur="2.689">number two laughed and giggled and</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="2.599">nudged the number</text>
  <text start="395.889" dur="3.721">so he had these different emotions and</text>
  <text start="397.749" dur="3.781">then they did the same thing to the guys</text>
  <text start="399.61" dur="4.559">on the other side of the room they went</text>
  <text start="401.53" dur="4.919">down the wall there okay and the guys</text>
  <text start="404.169" dur="6.09">did the same thing you know basically</text>
  <text start="406.449" dur="6.96">you had the same type of reaction</text>
  <text start="410.259" dur="6.12">reaction so then and I didn&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="413.409" dur="4.801">the the magazine pictures were of and</text>
  <text start="416.379" dur="6.57">then what they did was they showed a</text>
  <text start="418.21" dur="9.389">very offensive pedophile sex scene on a</text>
  <text start="422.949" dur="6.301">magazine they showed a sexual assault on</text>
  <text start="427.599" dur="3.81">a small child and they showed it to all</text>
  <text start="429.25" dur="4.889">the investigators they all had pretty</text>
  <text start="431.409" dur="6">much the same horrific reaction right</text>
  <text start="434.139" dur="5.34">and also with the guys but what I</text>
  <text start="437.409" dur="4.591">learned from that lesson was they</text>
  <text start="439.479" dur="5.49">finally when they said they showed a</text>
  <text start="442" dur="7.77">Playboy to the guys and they showed a</text>
  <text start="444.969" dur="6.75">Playgirl magazine to the females okay</text>
  <text start="449.77" dur="3.869">and so you had different reactions when</text>
  <text start="451.719" dur="5.01">people see that type of thing right but</text>
  <text start="453.639" dur="4.68">one thing that that Illustrated is if</text>
  <text start="456.729" dur="3.271">you&amp;#39;re attracted to the opposite sex you</text>
  <text start="458.319" dur="3.481">might find that offensive you might find</text>
  <text start="460" dur="3.449">that pleasing you might joke about it</text>
  <text start="461.8" dur="5.039">same thing with the guys they joke about</text>
  <text start="463.449" dur="6.541">the the Playboy magazine that they saw</text>
  <text start="466.839" dur="5.161">but one thing that in that room you have</text>
  <text start="469.99" dur="3.299">people passionate about investigating</text>
  <text start="472" dur="5.189">sexual assaults when they saw the</text>
  <text start="473.289" dur="6.78">pedophile pitcher they were shocked and</text>
  <text start="477.189" dur="5.671">there were some were angered by it and I</text>
  <text start="480.069" dur="6.241">realized just then oh my gosh these</text>
  <text start="482.86" dur="7.709">people are attracted sexually to</text>
  <text start="486.31" dur="7.589">children they&amp;#39;re not interested in same</text>
  <text start="490.569" dur="6.03">age ahead alright acceptable so I</text>
  <text start="493.899" dur="4.77">learned that as early age wow that when</text>
  <text start="496.599" dur="4.47">you that&amp;#39;s an experiment that you show</text>
  <text start="498.669" dur="5.011">what hey this is why we do what we do</text>
  <text start="501.069" dur="4.801">this is why you got to know you need to</text>
  <text start="503.68" dur="3.69">learn about these people if you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="505.87" dur="4.049">to be investigating them they are your</text>
  <text start="507.37" dur="5.06">children as an object of sex and because</text>
  <text start="509.919" dur="5.43">they do that some of them are really</text>
  <text start="512.43" dur="5.5">cunning and overt about it and that was</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="5.281">before online predators were even around</text>
  <text start="517.93" dur="5.31">right so you had people cruising arcades</text>
  <text start="520.63" dur="3.07">truth cruising community rec centers</text>
  <text start="523.24" dur="2.86">were</text>
  <text start="523.7" dur="4.38">I used to hang out and they were they be</text>
  <text start="526.1" dur="3.81">kind of like in the shadows like the</text>

  <text start="532.64" dur="5.76">the white man or whatever so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="535.37" dur="6.27">evolved and I&amp;#39;ve stayed with the changes</text>
  <text start="538.4" dur="6.77">and I that goes back to what I was</text>
  <text start="541.64" dur="7.62">telling you I&amp;#39;m fearful that through</text>
  <text start="545.17" dur="6.4">politics they&amp;#39;re gonna have all these</text>
  <text start="549.26" dur="4.68">attempts to socially accept that kind of</text>
  <text start="551.57" dur="4.86">behavior right out of all the ones that</text>
  <text start="553.94" dur="4.98">marijuana that I mentioned before the</text>

  <text start="565.07" dur="3.27">one step too far</text>
  <text start="566.09" dur="5.34">yeah and that spawns into satanical</text>
  <text start="568.34" dur="7.47">worshiping all those taboo things that</text>
  <text start="571.43" dur="6.6">the Satan worshippers do is give some</text>
  <text start="575.81" dur="5.34">more power the more taboo it is you know</text>
