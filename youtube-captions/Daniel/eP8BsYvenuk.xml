  <text start="8.3" dur="7.839">torah while it is true that holy writ is</text>
  <text start="13.469" dur="4.771">a book of progressive revelation and so</text>
  <text start="16.139" dur="3.841">far that as we proceed through its pages</text>
  <text start="18.24" dur="4.799">we discover more and more light and</text>
  <text start="19.98" dur="5.19">understanding of our great Yahshua we</text>
  <text start="23.039" dur="4.711">also find more and more precepts to</text>
  <text start="25.17" dur="6.09">protect us from the rising decay of this</text>
  <text start="27.75" dur="6.42">present godless world where sin abounds</text>
  <text start="31.26" dur="7.08">grace which is the ability to keep the</text>
  <text start="34.17" dur="8.94">law according to Titus to abounds even</text>
  <text start="38.34" dur="8.039">more however the beautiful intricate</text>
  <text start="43.11" dur="6.09">tessellation of Torah is woven through</text>
  <text start="46.379" dur="7.471">the entire Bible from the very beginning</text>
  <text start="49.2" dur="8.07">to the very end have you ever thought</text>
  <text start="53.85" dur="8.07">about the question did the Torah really</text>
  <text start="57.27" dur="9.54">begin at mo Shay after over two thousand</text>
  <text start="61.92" dur="6.96">years of Earth history no we know for</text>
  <text start="66.81" dur="5.19">certain from Scripture that Torah in</text>
  <text start="68.88" dur="6.87">some former fashion was first given to</text>
  <text start="72" dur="5.729">Adam we know for example Adam understood</text>
  <text start="75.75" dur="3.81">that from Friday sundown to Saturday</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="5.541">sundown otherwise known as the seventh</text>
  <text start="79.56" dur="6.419">day of the week he was to rest and relax</text>
  <text start="83.27" dur="4.209">the Shabbat commandment at the very</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="6.21">least was established from the very</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="6.541">beginning according to Genesis this is</text>
  <text start="92.189" dur="7.201">one of the first Commandments Yahweh</text>
  <text start="94.02" dur="8.099">ever gives we also know 16th centuries</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="4.95">later from the story of Noah that the</text>
  <text start="102.119" dur="4.921">dietary laws of Torah were already</text>
  <text start="104.34" dur="6.33">understood how do we know this because</text>
  <text start="107.04" dur="6.469">it says that Noah was told by yah to</text>
  <text start="110.67" dur="6.589">place seven of every clean animal and</text>
  <text start="113.509" dur="6.281">two of every unclean animal in the ark</text>
  <text start="117.259" dur="5.381">now this is really amazing when you</text>
  <text start="119.79" dur="7.2">consider that before the flood mankind</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="6.599">did not even eat meat at all yet they</text>
  <text start="126.99" dur="4.889">still have the dietary laws regarding</text>
  <text start="129.239" dur="3.821">meat that we can now find in Leviticus</text>
  <text start="131.879" dur="4.641">chapter 11</text>
  <text start="133.06" dur="6.1">otherwise how did Noah understand a</text>
  <text start="136.52" dur="8.07">distinguish between clean and unclean</text>
  <text start="139.16" dur="8.04">animals we see even as far back as the</text>
  <text start="144.59" dur="6.78">time of Cain and Abel that there were</text>
  <text start="147.2" dur="6.84">laws and regulations governing animal</text>
  <text start="151.37" dur="8">sacrifices we know that that Abel</text>
  <text start="154.04" dur="9.42">brought an animal sacrifice to Yahweh in</text>
  <text start="159.37" dur="6.73">the days of opera homme the book of</text>
  <text start="163.46" dur="4.83">Genesis declares that he walked in all</text>
  <text start="166.1" dur="4.92">the laws statutes and commandments of</text>
  <text start="168.29" dur="5.43">Yahweh but what law has Commandments and</text>
  <text start="171.02" dur="5.91">statutes was Genesis referring to after</text>
  <text start="173.72" dur="5.37">all Moshe had not yet been born the</text>
  <text start="176.93" dur="4.2">commandments had not been inscribed in</text>
  <text start="179.09" dur="5.73">stone in the Torah at Mount Sinai had</text>
  <text start="181.13" dur="5.25">not yet been given well it is obvious</text>
  <text start="184.82" dur="6.18">from the book of genesis of the torah</text>
  <text start="186.38" dur="6.39">had been revealed to Abraham in fact we</text>
  <text start="191" dur="4.38">know that the law of offerings and</text>
  <text start="192.77" dur="5.939">sacrifices and the law of giving or</text>
  <text start="195.38" dur="5.31">tithing were found and not only the many</text>
  <text start="198.709" dur="4.25">men who killed animals and offered them</text>
  <text start="200.69" dur="6.2">to ya but also in Abraham&amp;#39;s exchange</text>
  <text start="202.959" dur="6.221">with the high priest of shalam and</text>
  <text start="206.89" dur="8.05">shalam of course eventually would become</text>
  <text start="209.18" dur="8.93">the city of Yerushalayim Jerusalem so</text>
  <text start="214.94" dur="6.96">when we finally come to mo Shay and</text>
  <text start="218.11" dur="6.79">Mount Sinai what we really discover is</text>
  <text start="221.9" dur="5.76">that yah had to remind planet Earth of</text>
  <text start="224.9" dur="4.38">all the laws and statutes which they had</text>
  <text start="227.66" dur="4.14">forgotten due to the sin and darkness</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="6.81">that descended upon the earth since the</text>
  <text start="231.8" dur="9.24">time of the flood if you think about it</text>
  <text start="236.09" dur="10.14">if you read in the in the Psalms Psalm</text>
  <text start="241.04" dur="8.88">83 i believe it is told that joseph when</text>
  <text start="246.23" dur="5.19">he was wandering throughout egypt after</text>
  <text start="249.92" dur="4.47">his brothers had sold him into slavery</text>
  <text start="251.42" dur="6.99">it says that this is when israel first</text>
  <text start="254.39" dur="8.029">began to practice the new moon when</text>
  <text start="258.41" dur="7.17">joseph was in Egypt so we can find</text>
  <text start="262.419" dur="4.81">tidbits of Torah</text>
  <text start="265.58" dur="4.859">the statutes and commitments that are</text>
  <text start="267.229" dur="5.31">found in Torah all through the first two</text>
  <text start="270.439" dur="4.29">thousand years of mankind&amp;#39;s history well</text>
  <text start="272.539" dur="6.241">before mo Shay ever walked the earth or</text>
  <text start="274.729" dur="6.15">was given the commandments of Sinai now</text>
  <text start="278.78" dur="7.02">why is this important I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.879" dur="7.621">important because a lot of people i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="285.8" dur="4.32">referring to christians they think of</text>
  <text start="288.5" dur="4.65">Torah as something that was given solely</text>
  <text start="290.12" dur="5.639">to Moses at Mount Sinai for Israel at a</text>
  <text start="293.15" dur="4.53">particular period in time and then that</text>
  <text start="295.759" dur="4.321">time had a beginning and it had an end</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="4.68">but when we really study the scripture</text>
  <text start="300.08" dur="4.35">we see that Toro was actually given to</text>
  <text start="302.36" dur="6.929">Adam from Yahweh at the very beginning</text>
  <text start="304.43" dur="7.41">and we see this Torah emerging in many</text>
  <text start="309.289" dur="5.461">different men&amp;#39;s lives for that first two</text>
  <text start="311.84" dur="6.03">thousand year period of history we see</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="5.34">the fullness of Torah given to mo che at</text>
  <text start="317.87" dur="4.919">Sinai and of course it dominates</text>
  <text start="320.09" dur="5.4">Israel&amp;#39;s history for the next 2,000</text>
  <text start="322.789" dur="5.1">years and then we see Yahshua in the</text>
  <text start="325.49" dur="5.31">brain how to shop and he reaffirms the</text>
  <text start="327.889" dur="5.161">Torah he talking about many aspects of</text>
  <text start="330.8" dur="4.739">the Torah he obeys and practices the</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="3.959">Torah once Yahshua had died and</text>
  <text start="335.539" dur="4.62">resurrected we have the Apostles</text>
  <text start="337.009" dur="5.731">particularly Paul who while very</text>
  <text start="340.159" dur="6.81">misunderstood by most of the Christian</text>
  <text start="342.74" dur="7.649">world does reaffirm Torah over and over</text>
  <text start="346.969" dur="8.281">again for instance in Colossians chapter</text>
  <text start="350.389" dur="8.761">2 he urges and encourages and exhorts</text>
  <text start="355.25" dur="7.55">the believers in class not to allow the</text>
  <text start="359.15" dur="6.479">pagan Colossians to discourage them as</text>
  <text start="362.8" dur="5.53">they&amp;#39;re keeping the new moons and the</text>
  <text start="365.629" dur="6.15">Sabbath days and the feast days which</text>
  <text start="368.33" dur="7.17">all point toward things still yet to</text>
  <text start="371.779" dur="7.801">come this is several years after the</text>
  <text start="375.5" dur="7.56">resurrection in Acts chapter 21 we read</text>
  <text start="379.58" dur="7.649">about Paul and for others who go to the</text>
  <text start="383.06" dur="6.69">temple and in completing their Nazarene</text>
  <text start="387.229" dur="5.49">offering they literally offer animal</text>
  <text start="389.75" dur="8.06">sacrifices within the temple and this is</text>
  <text start="392.719" dur="6.321">furthermore to prove to the leaders</text>
  <text start="397.81" dur="4.62">the Jewish Christian congregation</text>
  <text start="399.04" dur="5.73">assembly in Jerusalem and to the body of</text>
  <text start="402.43" dur="4.17">Messiah large that he had not abandoned</text>
  <text start="404.77" dur="3.29">Torah and that Paul was not teaching</text>
  <text start="406.6" dur="4.55">against or because those rumors were</text>
  <text start="408.06" dur="8.29">alive and well throughout Jerusalem and</text>
  <text start="411.15" dur="8.05">and throughout Asia so we can see that</text>
  <text start="416.35" dur="3.96">Torah dominates all the scriptures from</text>
  <text start="419.2" dur="4.05">the beginning to the end that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="420.31" dur="5.7">literally a tessellation of tour that is</text>
  <text start="423.25" dur="5.639">woven through like a strand through the</text>
  <text start="426.01" dur="5.4">fabric of Scripture even when we come to</text>
  <text start="428.889" dur="4.231">the end the book of Revelation we see</text>
  <text start="431.41" dur="5.61">that it is those who are keeping the</text>
  <text start="433.12" dur="6.06">commandments of Yahweh Yahshua himself</text>
  <text start="437.02" dur="4.95">when he&amp;#39;s speaking of the end times he</text>
  <text start="439.18" dur="6.57">says pray that your flight is not in the</text>
  <text start="441.97" dur="5.64">winter or on the Sabbath no I be Joshua</text>
  <text start="445.75" dur="6.06">warned us about not having to flee on</text>
  <text start="447.61" dur="7.05">the Sabbath unless his people at the end</text>
  <text start="451.81" dur="5.28">of time we&amp;#39;re keeping the Sabbath day</text>
  <text start="454.66" dur="8.879">commandment which is a commandment found</text>
  <text start="457.09" dur="11.79">in Torah so make no mistake about it the</text>
  <text start="463.539" dur="8.731">Torah is as old as Yahweh himself Torah</text>
  <text start="468.88" dur="7.289">has no beginning and has no end his law</text>
  <text start="472.27" dur="6.48">has very word indoors forever in fact in</text>
  <text start="476.169" dur="6.511">the Psalms it says that he magnifies his</text>
  <text start="478.75" dur="7.91">word above his name have you ever really</text>
  <text start="482.68" dur="7.62">thought about what that means Yahweh is</text>
  <text start="486.66" dur="7.21">declaring through the psalmist buying</text>
  <text start="490.3" dur="8.61">the Ruach the Holy Spirit that he exalts</text>
  <text start="493.87" dur="8.39">his word above his very name that means</text>
  <text start="498.91" dur="7.68">he holds his Torah his law his word</text>
  <text start="502.26" dur="8.74">higher than even himself he submits</text>
  <text start="506.59" dur="6.119">himself to his own Torah Yahweh does not</text>
  <text start="511" dur="4.32">demand of us something that he does not</text>
  <text start="512.709" dur="5.311">demand of himself he simply asked us to</text>
  <text start="515.32" dur="6.469">walk as he walks he asked us to live as</text>
  <text start="518.02" dur="6.87">he lives and compliance to the Torah is</text>
  <text start="521.789" dur="5.561">the way that Yahweh himself conducts</text>
  <text start="524.89" dur="5.699">himself this is far different from the</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="4.56">Muslim God Allah who basically is very</text>
  <text start="530.589" dur="2.551">arbitrary</text>
  <text start="531.91" dur="3.12">could decide from one day to another</text>
  <text start="533.14" dur="5.1">what is right and what is wrong he may</text>
  <text start="535.03" dur="7.62">change his mind but not Yahweh not the</text>
  <text start="538.24" dur="7.01">evolver homme Yitzhak and Yaakov he is</text>
  <text start="542.65" dur="5.79">the same yesterday today and forever and</text>
  <text start="545.25" dur="6.7">he gave the Torah not first to Moshe he</text>
  <text start="548.44" dur="7.11">gave the Torah first to Adam and Noah</text>
  <text start="551.95" dur="6.9">fervently observed the Torah in bringing</text>
  <text start="555.55" dur="5.7">the animals onto the ark and Abraham</text>
  <text start="558.85" dur="4.86">fervently observed the Torah and walking</text>
  <text start="561.25" dur="4.38">in all the statutes of commandments and</text>
  <text start="563.71" dur="3.93">his great-grandson Joseph fervently</text>
  <text start="565.63" dur="5.19">obeyed the Torah in observing the new</text>
  <text start="567.64" dur="4.59">moon and finally that Torah was brought</text>
  <text start="570.82" dur="3.27">back in the days of Moses and then</text>
  <text start="572.23" dur="5.48">reaffirmed and ratified by the blood of</text>
  <text start="574.09" dur="5.73">Yahshua HaMashiach and the Brit hadashah</text>
  <text start="577.71" dur="4.57">study the Scriptures yourself and show</text>
  <text start="579.82" dur="4.74">yourself approved I guarantee you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="582.28" dur="5.4">that Torah the tessellation of Torah is</text>
