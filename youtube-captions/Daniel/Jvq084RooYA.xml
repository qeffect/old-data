  <text start="17.81" dur="4.21">don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve been experiencing</text>
  <text start="20.67" dur="2.97">this but I&amp;#39;ve been talking to friends</text>
  <text start="22.02" dur="4.11">who have and I know I&amp;#39;ve been going</text>
  <text start="23.64" dur="4.17">through this as well but lately it seems</text>
  <text start="26.13" dur="3.84">like there&amp;#39;s been a lot of anxieties and</text>
  <text start="27.81" dur="4.499">worries that have been trying to come</text>
  <text start="29.97" dur="4.98">into my mind and the minds of my friends</text>
  <text start="32.309" dur="5.82">and and minds of I think the bride of</text>
  <text start="34.95" dur="6.14">Messiah at large of course we&amp;#39;re living</text>
  <text start="38.129" dur="5.43">in a very dark time of Earth history and</text>
  <text start="41.09" dur="4.27">so it&amp;#39;s easy for these distractions and</text>
  <text start="43.559" dur="4.471">these worries and things as anxieties to</text>
  <text start="45.36" dur="4.199">target our hearts and a Pilatus there is</text>
  <text start="48.03" dur="4.68">a scripture however that&amp;#39;s been burning</text>
  <text start="49.559" dur="6.051">in my mind that I want to read it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="52.71" dur="5.61">Ephesians chapter 5 starting in verse 19</text>
  <text start="55.61" dur="6.699">says speaking to yourselves in Psalms</text>
  <text start="58.32" dur="7.61">and hymns and spiritual songs singing</text>
  <text start="62.309" dur="8.911">and making melody in your heart to</text>
  <text start="65.93" dur="7.42">Yahweh giving thanks always for all</text>
  <text start="71.22" dur="7.02">things unto yah the Father in the name</text>
  <text start="73.35" dur="7.92">of our Adonai Yahshua HaMashiach see</text>
  <text start="78.24" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s not just talking about offering up</text>
  <text start="81.27" dur="4.169">of thanks or singing a little worship</text>
  <text start="83.31" dur="3.51">song during our devotion time or during</text>
  <text start="85.439" dur="3.601">a time when we get together with friends</text>
  <text start="86.82" dur="4.68">to worship you out but it&amp;#39;s saying to do</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="4.14">this always whether we&amp;#39;re at the job</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="2.93">whether we&amp;#39;re at home whether we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="93.18" dur="5.43">the grocery store wherever we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="94.43" dur="5.439">that were singing Psalms under yah i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="98.61" dur="3.36">not saying make a huge dramatic</text>
  <text start="99.869" dur="4.621">performance of it but singing Psalms and</text>
  <text start="101.97" dur="3.87">beyond your heart humming to him loving</text>
  <text start="104.49" dur="3.78">him praising him when you&amp;#39;re driving in</text>
  <text start="105.84" dur="4.83">your car alone praising him and giving</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="4.08">thanks to him always constantly so that</text>
  <text start="110.67" dur="3.6">whenever those anxious thoughts come</text>
  <text start="112.35" dur="4.019">into your mind you just combat it with</text>
  <text start="114.27" dur="4.32">banking yah thanking yah for what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="4.71">given you thinking Yahshua for what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="6.059">done for you and in that way it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="121.079" dur="4.89">provide a shield for you you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="124.649" dur="3.42">going to enter a time in Earth&amp;#39;s history</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="4.111">where Joshua says that things are gonna</text>
  <text start="128.069" dur="4.481">get so bad that men&amp;#39;s hearts are going</text>
  <text start="130.08" dur="3.76">to fail them for the fear</text>
  <text start="132.55" dur="2.25">the fear that&amp;#39;s going to consume them</text>
  <text start="133.84" dur="3.36">because of all the things that are going</text>
  <text start="134.8" dur="4.65">on in the earth I think about that if</text>
  <text start="137.2" dur="3.63">right now where things are still yeah</text>
  <text start="139.45" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re bad but they&amp;#39;re still relatively</text>
  <text start="140.83" dur="4.68">peaceful if we can&amp;#39;t keep our minds on</text>
  <text start="143.08" dur="5.67">yeah how are we going to keep our minds</text>
  <text start="145.51" dur="4.65">on yah during that dark dark period we</text>
  <text start="148.75" dur="3.42">need to learn to do it now we need to</text>
  <text start="150.16" dur="4.41">learn to be thanking him always now we</text>
  <text start="152.17" dur="3.93">need to be learning to having hymns and</text>
  <text start="154.57" dur="4.26">spiritual songs on our lips and in our</text>
  <text start="156.1" dur="4.2">hearts now so that when the really</text>
  <text start="158.83" dur="4.79">really bad things come down the pike</text>
  <text start="160.3" dur="5.49">will be ready it&amp;#39;s like a testing ground</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="4.18">so I think that&amp;#39;s very very important to</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="3.96">remember there&amp;#39;s another verse when I</text>
  <text start="167.8" dur="8.67">just flip to it here real quickly it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.75" dur="10.29">in Isaiah 26 verse 3 and it says you</text>
  <text start="176.47" dur="6.06">will keep him talking to Yahweh Yahweh</text>
  <text start="180.04" dur="6.98">will keep him in perfect peace whose</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="9.9">mind is stayed upon you upon Yahweh</text>
  <text start="187.02" dur="7.87">because he trusts in you Yahshua will</text>
  <text start="192.43" dur="7.309">keep us in perfect peace we just trust</text>
  <text start="194.89" dur="6.96">in him if we stay our mind on him and</text>
  <text start="199.739" dur="5.5">Ephesians talks about a practical way to</text>
  <text start="201.85" dur="5.01">do that so I think that&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="205.239" dur="3.541">important that we remember to keep our</text>
  <text start="206.86" dur="3.69">mind centered on him so that his Shalom</text>
  <text start="208.78" dur="6.39">his joy will continue to fill our lives</text>
  <text start="210.55" dur="6.63">no matter what happens now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="215.17" dur="3.93">another issue I want to talk about this</text>
  <text start="217.18" dur="3.51">is the second one and this might be a</text>
  <text start="219.1" dur="5.76">little more touchy but I think it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="220.69" dur="5.88">important I&amp;#39;m going to start off by</text>
  <text start="224.86" dur="2.97">giving an example of what I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="226.57" dur="3.57">about and then I&amp;#39;ll go more into detail</text>
  <text start="227.83" dur="4.77">about what what this is all about I was</text>
  <text start="230.14" dur="5.25">dealing with a person who had come to my</text>
  <text start="232.6" dur="5.72">website and initially our conversation</text>
  <text start="235.39" dur="5.49">was was really good and then this person</text>
  <text start="238.32" dur="5.139">mentioned that you know they kept the</text>
  <text start="240.88" dur="4.38">lunar Sabbath and as opposed to the</text>
  <text start="243.459" dur="3.361">seventh-day Sabbath the Shabbat</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="3.09">happening on from friday evening to</text>
  <text start="246.82" dur="4.74">saturday evening which is when the</text>
  <text start="248.35" dur="4.77">Shabbat occurs and i presented to this</text>
  <text start="251.56" dur="3.959">person some very very clear evidence</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="3.869">from Scripture that the sabbath day is</text>
  <text start="255.519" dur="4.201">on the seventh day the week which is</text>
  <text start="256.989" dur="5.761">from friday evening to saturday evening</text>
  <text start="259.72" dur="5.49">and instead of really wanting to respond</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="3.02">to that the person just said well you</text>
  <text start="265.21" dur="2.179">know you</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="2.97">do your thing and I&amp;#39;ll do my thing and</text>
  <text start="267.389" dur="2.611">you know everything everything will be</text>
  <text start="268.74" dur="4.429">okay you know let&amp;#39;s just agree to</text>
  <text start="270" dur="6.479">disagree there&amp;#39;s something really wrong</text>
  <text start="273.169" dur="5.47">about that type of thinking I mean</text>
  <text start="276.479" dur="4.831">that&amp;#39;s basically the same relativist</text>
  <text start="278.639" dur="4.201">humanistic nonsense that we get from our</text>
  <text start="281.31" dur="5.9">college universities and from the</text>
  <text start="282.84" dur="4.37">heathen that you know every way is right</text>
  <text start="287.509" dur="9.37">there is one way to interpret scriptures</text>
  <text start="291.949" dur="7.81">one way and that way will always lead us</text>
  <text start="296.879" dur="5.611">to glorify Yahshua to exalt him to love</text>
  <text start="299.759" dur="5.581">him there&amp;#39;s not a bunch of different</text>
  <text start="302.49" dur="4.62">ways now we can have different</text>
  <text start="305.34" dur="3.329">understandings and problems with our</text>
  <text start="307.11" dur="4.38">understanding of Scripture but we should</text>
  <text start="308.669" dur="4.411">if we&amp;#39;re if two people are more than one</text>
  <text start="311.49" dur="3.54">person is filled with the same ruach</text>
  <text start="313.08" dur="3.959">hakodesh the same Holy Spirit they</text>
  <text start="315.03" dur="4.41">should by examining scripters be able to</text>
  <text start="317.039" dur="5.16">come to a unified agreement about what</text>
  <text start="319.44" dur="4.68">that scripture says when in Yahshua said</text>
  <text start="322.199" dur="3.631">he was the only way the truth and the</text>
  <text start="324.12" dur="3.18">life he didn&amp;#39;t say there&amp;#39;s a bunch of</text>
  <text start="325.83" dur="4.619">different roads and paths there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="6.03">one way and in his Commandments they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="330.449" dur="4.351">very very clear I remember once I was</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="3.69">preaching at Portland State University</text>
  <text start="334.8" dur="3.75">and these students were trying to say</text>
  <text start="337.02" dur="3">the same thing well Daniel there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="338.55" dur="3.299">many different ways to interpret the</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="5.429">Bible you can&amp;#39;t claim to know the right</text>
  <text start="341.849" dur="6.511">way well it&amp;#39;s very easy to know what the</text>
  <text start="345.449" dur="5.131">Bible says for example when the</text>
  <text start="348.36" dur="3.54">scripture says you wear blue zeit zeit</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="2.55">on the four corners of your garments</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s not really that many</text>
  <text start="353.13" dur="4.529">ways to interpret that I mean it says</text>
  <text start="356.34" dur="2.819">the same thing in English as it does in</text>
  <text start="357.659" dur="5.551">Spanish as it does in Hebrew as it</text>
  <text start="359.159" dur="5.51">doesn&amp;#39;t it means put four blue zeit zeit</text>
  <text start="363.21" dur="4.889">on the four corners of your garments</text>
  <text start="364.669" dur="6.22">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what it means when it says</text>
  <text start="368.099" dur="4.801">thou shalt not commit adultery that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="370.889" dur="3.481">that&amp;#39;s what it means do not commit</text>
  <text start="372.9" dur="4.23">adultery when it says thou shalt not</text>
  <text start="374.37" dur="8.639">steal not a lot of ways to interpret</text>
  <text start="377.13" dur="8.279">that you shall not still there&amp;#39;s one way</text>
  <text start="383.009" dur="4.38">to interpret the Scriptures Oh Daniel</text>
  <text start="385.409" dur="3.66">you&amp;#39;re saying you&amp;#39;re the you are the</text>
  <text start="387.389" dur="3.721">only one who knows no I&amp;#39;m not the only</text>
  <text start="389.069" dur="3.72">one who knows anyone who&amp;#39;s still with</text>
  <text start="391.11" dur="3.359">the ruach ha kodesh anyone who&amp;#39;s part of</text>
  <text start="392.789" dur="3.271">the bride of Messiah will know how to</text>
  <text start="394.469" dur="3.781">properly read the scriptures that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="396.06" dur="3.069">he gives us His Holy Spirit so we can</text>
  <text start="398.25" dur="2.559">properly</text>
  <text start="399.129" dur="4.141">need the Holy Scriptures and probably</text>
  <text start="400.809" dur="5.551">apply it to our lives now again there</text>
  <text start="403.27" dur="4.53">can be misunderstandings if we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="406.36" dur="4.019">clearly understand something and so we</text>
  <text start="407.8" dur="4.709">have to search a matter out but there</text>
  <text start="410.379" dur="4.44">still should be unity between brothers</text>
  <text start="412.509" dur="5.01">and sisters in Messiah on what the Bible</text>
  <text start="414.819" dur="4.74">says after all Yahshua said unless you</text>
  <text start="417.519" dur="4.281">become like a little child you canna no</text>
  <text start="419.559" dur="4.56">wise enter into the kingdom of heaven</text>
  <text start="421.8" dur="4.299">when I think about that that part of a</text>
  <text start="424.119" dur="4.17">child of just wanting to delight their</text>
  <text start="426.099" dur="6.391">parents wanted to light our Heavenly</text>
  <text start="428.289" dur="5.97">Father Yahweh Yahshua when I think about</text>
  <text start="432.49" dur="4.019">that I think okay well then that means</text>
  <text start="434.259" dur="4.38">that I don&amp;#39;t have to be some huge</text>
  <text start="436.509" dur="3.571">scholar or I don&amp;#39;t have to have all this</text>
  <text start="438.639" dur="3.24">knowledge to understand what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="440.08" dur="3.989">simply put down in the scriptures I</text>
  <text start="441.879" dur="4.65">simply have to read what the Bible says</text>
  <text start="444.069" dur="6.421">and apply it to my life and do what it</text>
  <text start="446.529" dur="7.59">says it&amp;#39;s that simple and Yahshua made</text>
  <text start="450.49" dur="5.25">it made it very clear so I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.119" dur="3.15">important and the reason I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="455.74" dur="2.909">important is because i think the anti</text>
  <text start="457.269" dur="4.14">Messiah and the spirit of the anthem</text>
  <text start="458.649" dur="5.1">assiyah will be all about confusion and</text>
  <text start="461.409" dur="4.68">be all about hey you do your thing I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="463.749" dur="4.26">do my thing everything&amp;#39;s good you go</text>
  <text start="466.089" dur="8.94">your way I&amp;#39;ll go my way hey we can still</text>
  <text start="468.009" dur="8.46">have wonderful unity no not when it</text>
  <text start="475.029" dur="4.831">comes to obeying the commandments of</text>
  <text start="476.469" dur="5.55">Yahweh there&amp;#39;s only one way to go now</text>
  <text start="479.86" dur="4.709">you can have different personalities and</text>
  <text start="482.019" dur="4.92">we can have different likes and you know</text>
  <text start="484.569" dur="5.43">favorite colors and we can have you know</text>
  <text start="486.939" dur="5.1">different things that we enjoy doing but</text>
  <text start="489.999" dur="4.92">when it comes to the scriptures in the</text>
  <text start="492.039" dur="5">Bible when it comes to the Commandments</text>
  <text start="494.919" dur="5.64">in the Bible there&amp;#39;s only one way</text>
  <text start="497.039" dur="5.92">there&amp;#39;s only one way so I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="500.559" dur="4.47">make that very very clear because I I</text>
  <text start="502.959" dur="4.31">sense that spirit of Antichrist just</text>
  <text start="505.029" dur="4.89">sort of seeping through a lot of</text>
  <text start="507.269" dur="3.971">religious people saying that we can just</text>
  <text start="509.919" dur="3.66">kind of do whatever we want and</text>
  <text start="511.24" dur="4.549">everything&amp;#39;s right in our own eyes and</text>
  <text start="513.579" dur="5.281">that&amp;#39;s definitely not the case so</text>
  <text start="515.789" dur="5.141">hallelujah shabbat shalom may you have a</text>
