  <text start="45.78" dur="3.27">if we&amp;#39;re going to move on in the</text>
  <text start="46.8" dur="6.89">weightier matters of the faith and into</text>
  <text start="49.05" dur="7.95">taurog if you go to Hebrews chapter 6</text>
  <text start="53.69" dur="5.29">Apostles shall fossil Paul he says that</text>
  <text start="57" dur="3.809">there are six doctrines that that every</text>
  <text start="58.98" dur="4.2">believer should understand and practice</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="4.92">and believe and know and do if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="5.31">going to be mature in the faith and move</text>
  <text start="65.729" dur="5.101">on says in Hebrews 6 starting in verse 1</text>
  <text start="68.49" dur="4.23">therefore leaving the principles of the</text>
  <text start="70.83" dur="3.93">doctrine of Messiah let us go on unto</text>
  <text start="72.72" dur="4.259">perfection not laying again the</text>
  <text start="74.76" dur="4.85">foundation of repentance of dead works</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="5.341">faith toward yah doctrine of baptisms</text>
  <text start="79.61" dur="5.049">laying on of hands resurrection of the</text>
  <text start="82.32" dur="4.47">Dead and eternal judgment so those six</text>
  <text start="84.659" dur="5.011">doctrines Paul saying look you guys</text>
  <text start="86.79" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s a basic basic basic basic level</text>
  <text start="89.67" dur="3.87">that you should be at so that we can</text>
  <text start="91.14" dur="5.07">move on unto perfection I want to deal</text>
  <text start="93.54" dur="4.86">with the first one and it is repentance</text>
  <text start="96.21" dur="3.659">from dead works what does that mean the</text>
  <text start="98.4" dur="3.96">penance of dead works basically means</text>
  <text start="99.869" dur="4.411">this if you have placed your faith in</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="3.21">the Messiah Yahshua if you&amp;#39;re covered in</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="3.18">his blood atonement if you love him and</text>
  <text start="105.57" dur="5.369">you trust him you&amp;#39;re not going to send</text>
  <text start="107.46" dur="4.71">okay it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s that clear loving yah</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="2.551">with all your heart soul mind and</text>
  <text start="112.17" dur="3.78">strength and loving your neighbors</text>
  <text start="113.49" dur="4.979">yourself is incompatible with sin and</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="6.72">this is very clearly spelled out in 1st</text>
  <text start="118.469" dur="6.391">John chapter 3 verse 6 through 11 also</text>
  <text start="122.67" dur="5.58">you could read Matthew chapter 5 verse</text>
  <text start="124.86" dur="4.53">48 Joshua says be you perfect as my</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="3.93">father in heaven as</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="4.77">perfect now the hebrew word for perfect</text>
  <text start="132.18" dur="4.77">is tommy own which means blameless</text>
  <text start="134.16" dur="5.34">pure-hearted so it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you</text>
  <text start="136.95" dur="6.81">know everything what it does mean is</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="6.24">that the state you&amp;#39;re in is that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="5.25">doing all you know to please yacht and</text>
  <text start="145.74" dur="4.8">and to and to live holy ok so you</text>
  <text start="149.01" dur="2.64">basically you&amp;#39;re loving yah with</text>
  <text start="150.54" dur="2.88">everything in you and your loving your</text>
  <text start="151.65" dur="3.78">neighbors yourself and if you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="153.42" dur="4.319">that through the help of ya&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="155.43" dur="3.99">dwelling Holy Spirit and and by the</text>
  <text start="157.739" dur="3.961">powers blood atonement if you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="159.42" dur="5.28">that then you&amp;#39;re not going to be sinning</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="5.759">ok because those two actions are</text>
  <text start="164.7" dur="4.59">incompatible I had a brother who even</text>
  <text start="167.459" dur="3.03">talked about how you know sin always</text>
  <text start="169.29" dur="3.36">starts with a thought we got a thought</text>
  <text start="170.489" dur="4.621">in her mind and if we dwell on that</text>
  <text start="172.65" dur="4.68">thought and begin to entertain it then</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="4.17">that can lead to sin and so we have to</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="4.8">take captive of that thought and subject</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="4.11">it to obedience to Yahshua because the</text>
  <text start="182.13" dur="3.78">scriptures are clear it says whenever</text>
  <text start="183.39" dur="4.59">you&amp;#39;re tempted yah provides a way out in</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="4.049">fact that&amp;#39;s the whole reason why Yahshua</text>
  <text start="187.98" dur="3.6">manifested himself in the flesh on earth</text>
  <text start="189.959" dur="4.831">was to destroy the works of the devil</text>
  <text start="191.58" dur="5.34">and to basically he went through all the</text>
  <text start="194.79" dur="7.89">temptations we went through and so he is</text>
  <text start="196.92" dur="7.95">able to help us to overcome sin so if we</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="4.71">love Yahshua and for walking in him</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re going to not sin we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="207.39" dur="4.49">live whole day we&amp;#39;re gonna live pure and</text>
  <text start="208.98" dur="5.43">this is a basic basic basic basic</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="4.449">foundational doctrine that every</text>
  <text start="214.41" dur="3.66">believer I don&amp;#39;t care for messianic or</text>
  <text start="216.329" dur="3.781">Christian should understand so that you</text>
  <text start="218.07" dur="3.24">can move on into Torah and into these</text>
  <text start="220.11" dur="4.71">other Commandments and to do the things</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="4.95">that he wants us to do yeah is never</text>
  <text start="224.82" dur="3.81">going to give us a command that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="4.71">impossible to do now he told the woman</text>
  <text start="228.63" dur="3.64">caught in adultery he said go and sin no</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="3.13">more</text>
  <text start="232.27" dur="3.63">well he wouldn&amp;#39;t have told her to do</text>
  <text start="234.1" dur="4.83">that unless it was possible for her to</text>
  <text start="235.9" dur="5.73">do that and indeed it was from that</text>
  <text start="238.93" dur="3.93">point on she could have gone for the</text>
  <text start="241.63" dur="3.6">rest of her life with never sitting</text>
  <text start="242.86" dur="5.85">again by placing her faith in yahushua</text>
  <text start="245.23" dur="7.29">and i believe that she did now let me</text>
  <text start="248.71" dur="5.25">give you a more personal example just</text>
  <text start="252.52" dur="4.62">after i made that video last night I</text>
  <text start="253.96" dur="5.79">went to bed and you know Apostle Paul he</text>
  <text start="257.14" dur="4.98">talks about how it&amp;#39;s better to get</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="4.17">married than to burn and then you know</text>
  <text start="262.12" dur="4.59">what I mean my burning maybe women you</text>
  <text start="263.92" dur="5.34">know too and last night I mean I had</text>
  <text start="266.71" dur="4.98">such a burning I was yearning and</text>
  <text start="269.26" dur="5.4">desiring for basically sexual union with</text>
  <text start="271.69" dur="5.1">a woman with a female and I had to cry</text>
  <text start="274.66" dur="5">out to you I said yeah please you know</text>
  <text start="276.79" dur="5.76">take these feelings and desires away</text>
  <text start="279.66" dur="4.99">because the only time sexuality is</text>
  <text start="282.55" dur="4.5">permitted in scriptures is between a man</text>
  <text start="284.65" dur="4.65">and a woman who have made a lifelong</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="4.05">covenant with each other i eed marriage</text>
  <text start="289.3" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s the only time it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s permitted</text>
  <text start="291.1" dur="5.55">and so I had to cram too yeah and then I</text>
  <text start="294.28" dur="3.9">I contacted a close brother of mine this</text>
  <text start="296.65" dur="4.8">morning and I said look I need you to</text>
  <text start="298.18" dur="7.29">pray for me and pray that that yah will</text>
  <text start="301.45" dur="5.34">give me a godly wife you know if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.47" dur="3.3">his will</text>
  <text start="306.79" dur="5.46">because you know one of the main reasons</text>
  <text start="308.77" dur="4.95">a man is to get married is an outlet for</text>
  <text start="312.25" dur="3.48">sexual feelings I know that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="3.9">popular in today&amp;#39;s politically correct</text>
  <text start="315.73" dur="3.81">world but that&amp;#39;s you know Paul makes</text>
  <text start="317.62" dur="4.56">that very clear and and it&amp;#39;s clear in</text>
  <text start="319.54" dur="5.57">the scriptures of course marriage is</text>
  <text start="322.18" dur="6.72">much deeper than that marriage is a</text>
  <text start="325.11" dur="5.77">symbolic mirror image of the</text>
  <text start="328.9" dur="5.16">relationship between Yahshua and his</text>
  <text start="330.88" dur="7.92">bride Yahshua and the the called out</text>
  <text start="334.06" dur="6.96">ones the the ecclesia and just as</text>
  <text start="338.8" dur="4.26">Yahshua lays his wife life down for the</text>
  <text start="341.02" dur="4.05">bride and the bride submits to Yahshua</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="3.66">so to the husband is to lay his life</text>
  <text start="345.07" dur="4.83">down for his wife and the wife submits</text>
  <text start="346.72" dur="5.16">to her husband and the marriage covenant</text>
  <text start="349.9" dur="3.33">contains a great mystery because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.88" dur="4.86">pointing toward a time and we are going</text>
  <text start="353.23" dur="7.8">to have incredible intimacy with yah</text>
  <text start="356.74" dur="6.24">after the resurrection but nevertheless</text>
  <text start="361.03" dur="3.66">the scripture says that he who finds a</text>
  <text start="362.98" dur="3.45">wife finds a good thing so I told my</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="4.98">brother I said please pray if its jaws</text>
  <text start="366.43" dur="6.33">will that I can quickly find a wife to</text>
  <text start="369.67" dur="4.35">help me through this because that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="372.76" dur="3.54">of the purposes of marriage and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.02" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s hard to live single it is hard</text>
  <text start="376.3" dur="6.09">to live a single life when you&amp;#39;re a man</text>
  <text start="379.75" dur="4.47">and now some people have the gift of</text>
  <text start="382.39" dur="4.11">being able to live single Paul had that</text>
  <text start="384.22" dur="4.8">gift and some people have that gift I</text>
  <text start="386.5" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t seem to have that gift at all but</text>
  <text start="389.02" dur="3.18">the only reason I&amp;#39;m bringing this up is</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="4.68">to show that even though the temptation</text>
  <text start="392.2" dur="7.56">was intense last night Yahshua helped me</text>
  <text start="395.05" dur="6.42">to overcome okay now there&amp;#39;s an issue I</text>
  <text start="399.76" dur="3.42">need to bring up related to this that</text>
  <text start="401.47" dur="3.12">you know if you have children in your in</text>
  <text start="403.18" dur="4.29">the room you should get them out because</text>
  <text start="404.59" dur="5.33">this is a very sensitive and yet serious</text>
  <text start="407.47" dur="2.45">topic</text>
  <text start="411.33" dur="4.77">sexuality is only allowed within</text>
  <text start="413.83" dur="4.8">marriage between a husband and his wife</text>
  <text start="416.1" dur="4.75">there in a lifelong covenant that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="418.63" dur="7.8">it was from the beginning between Adam</text>
  <text start="420.85" dur="8.28">and Eve so anything outside of that is</text>
  <text start="426.43" dur="4.71">sin it&amp;#39;s wrong and you you better not be</text>
  <text start="429.13" dur="5.04">doing it or you&amp;#39;re going to be cast into</text>
  <text start="431.14" dur="5.46">the lake of fire Yahshua said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.17" dur="6.45">better to cut your hand off than to be</text>
  <text start="436.6" dur="6.23">them to fall on the lust and be cast in</text>
  <text start="440.62" dur="4.77">the lake of fire hole and there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="442.83" dur="4.12">deception going around in fact I just</text>
  <text start="445.39" dur="3.96">realized that one of the people that I</text>
  <text start="446.95" dur="4.85">have linked to for a long time guy named</text>
  <text start="449.35" dur="5.22">Chris White teaches a doctrine that I</text>
  <text start="451.8" dur="6.06">now realize is wicked in fact I need to</text>
  <text start="454.57" dur="6.42">remove Chris White from my from my links</text>
  <text start="457.86" dur="5.02">because he was teaching and some others</text>
  <text start="460.99" dur="5.67">have teach thought that that</text>
  <text start="462.88" dur="5.73">masturbation is permitted is okay as</text>
  <text start="466.66" dur="3.36">long as you don&amp;#39;t have you know lustful</text>
  <text start="468.61" dur="3.66">thoughts that if you just masturbate</text>
  <text start="470.02" dur="5.03">without thinking badly that it&amp;#39;s okay oh</text>
  <text start="472.27" dur="5.7">that&amp;#39;s wickedness that is wickedness</text>
  <text start="475.05" dur="4.36">masturbation is wicked of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.97" dur="3.15">definitely wicked if you&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="479.41" dur="3.78">pornography or you&amp;#39;re lusting in your</text>
  <text start="481.12" dur="3.99">mind or heart that&amp;#39;s a no-brainer</text>
  <text start="483.19" dur="3.57">because Yahshua said if you even look</text>
  <text start="485.11" dur="4.29">upon a woman to lust after her you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="486.76" dur="4.62">committed adultery but even if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="489.4" dur="5.82">masturbating and you don&amp;#39;t entertain bad</text>
  <text start="491.38" dur="6.03">thoughts it&amp;#39;s still wicked because</text>
  <text start="495.22" dur="4.17">you&amp;#39;re basically doing that which was</text>
  <text start="497.41" dur="3.72">only intended to do within the confines</text>
  <text start="499.39" dur="4.32">of marriage and you&amp;#39;re taking it out of</text>
  <text start="501.13" dur="5.19">that context and fulfilling it you know</text>
  <text start="503.71" dur="6.48">in a way that&amp;#39;s completely unnatural and</text>
  <text start="506.32" dur="5.58">wicked so men women if you are engaged</text>
  <text start="510.19" dur="4.56">in that practice I&amp;#39;m telling you right</text>
  <text start="511.9" dur="4.65">now you hit better cry out to you and</text>
  <text start="514.75" dur="4.14">start getting on your face and praying</text>
  <text start="516.55" dur="4.53">and fasting and not doing that or you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="518.89" dur="5.25">going to go to the lake of fire thus</text>
  <text start="521.08" dur="5.1">sayeth yacht and and I apologize for</text>
  <text start="524.14" dur="3.75">being so sloppy is to allow teachers</text>
  <text start="526.18" dur="3.39">like Chris White to be linked to my</text>
  <text start="527.89" dur="3.42">website that teaches things like that I</text>
  <text start="529.57" dur="3.53">should have I should have been more</text>
  <text start="531.31" dur="4.91">zealous and careful</text>
  <text start="533.1" dur="4.56">but that&amp;#39;s very important so I want to</text>
  <text start="536.22" dur="3.51">come back to what I originally made this</text>
  <text start="537.66" dur="3.989">video format is yah we&amp;#39;ll always provide</text>
  <text start="539.73" dur="4.109">a way out of temptation he always does</text>
  <text start="541.649" dur="4.771">we just have to keep our eyes on him and</text>
  <text start="543.839" dur="4.291">we have to realize that the reason he</text>
  <text start="546.42" dur="3.359">one of the reasons he manifested in the</text>
  <text start="548.13" dur="3.509">flesh was not just to die for our sins</text>
  <text start="549.779" dur="4.441">of me an atonement was to show us how to</text>
  <text start="551.639" dur="5.07">live holy and through the power of his</text>
  <text start="554.22" dur="4.95">spirit and his blood we can live holy we</text>
  <text start="556.709" dur="5.461">can resist all sin and habitually</text>
  <text start="559.17" dur="5.219">overcome and live holy and as David</text>
