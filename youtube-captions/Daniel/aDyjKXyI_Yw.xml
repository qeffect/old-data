  <text start="366.43" dur="4.35">federal immigration enforcement in the</text>
  <text start="368.02" dur="6.06">sanctuary cities movement I think this</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="5.16">is I think it&amp;#39;s pretty neat that people</text>
  <text start="374.08" dur="3.99">who care about their second Amendment</text>
  <text start="375.94" dur="3.66">rights they&amp;#39;re using what the Democrats</text>
  <text start="378.07" dur="3.24">used against them so the Democrats</text>
  <text start="379.6" dur="3.55">wanted to make these sanctuary cities</text>
  <text start="381.31" dur="4.36">for illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="383.15" dur="4.38">and now people not just in Virginia but</text>
  <text start="385.67" dur="4.08">we see in other states as well including</text>
  <text start="387.53" dur="3.54">Illinois are creating sanctuary counties</text>
  <text start="389.75" dur="2.52">for this saying you&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="391.07" dur="2.94">able to touch our guns you&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="392.27" dur="5.28">to be able to infringe on our Second</text>

  <text start="863.29" dur="2.61">have heard just in my last</text>
  <text start="864.76" dur="2.91">year-and-a-half of doing this</text>
  <text start="865.9" dur="3.57">investigative reporting from so many</text>

  <text start="869.47" dur="2.76">accused</text>
  <text start="870.19" dur="3.84">they didn&amp;#39;t abuse their child but</text>
  <text start="872.23" dur="3.66">because of one physician making a</text>
  <text start="874.03" dur="4.17">comment saying oh yeah I think that this</text>
  <text start="875.89" dur="5.19">child was abused that statement is then</text>
  <text start="878.2" dur="5.79">used in these fraudulent domestic courts</text>
  <text start="881.08" dur="5.61">and the child was taken away and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="883.99" dur="5.04">just absolutely insane and so yeah I</text>
  <text start="886.69" dur="5.7">agree there does need to be laws passed</text>
  <text start="889.03" dur="7.59">to prevent this abuse from happening I</text>
  <text start="892.39" dur="6.3">don&amp;#39;t know if many decades ago when CPS</text>
  <text start="896.62" dur="4.41">was first formed if it was actually</text>
  <text start="898.69" dur="4.47">helping and preventing abuse of children</text>
  <text start="901.03" dur="4.49">I don&amp;#39;t think it really was I think from</text>

  <text start="913.61" dur="2.669">of stuff I started pushing this type of</text>
  <text start="914.87" dur="4.86">stuff and through the power of the</text>
  <text start="916.279" dur="6.81">executive pen basically starting to use</text>
  <text start="919.73" dur="6.93">CPS as a means to snatch children from</text>
  <text start="923.089" dur="6.541">their families so the more we can do to</text>
  <text start="926.66" dur="7.109">unwind this to break this down the</text>
  <text start="929.63" dur="7.53">better the better okay now guys I am not</text>
  <text start="933.769" dur="5.521">in any way promoting Christmas</text>
