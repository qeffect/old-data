  <text start="177.27" dur="3.78">the Senate unbelievable so queue</text>
  <text start="179.58" dur="4.56">reminding us that the Democrat Party</text>

  <text start="185.76" dur="3.39">to do with the woman&amp;#39;s right to choose</text>
  <text start="186.81" dur="4.26">that is the fake false narrative that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.15" dur="4.62">put out so that the masses will accept</text>

  <text start="214.8" dur="4.71">glad that Q is decided to remind us of</text>
  <text start="217.11" dur="4.29">this because it&amp;#39;s very important that we</text>
  <text start="219.51" dur="3.93">understand what the reality is</text>
  <text start="221.4" dur="4.68">rather than this false fake narrative</text>
  <text start="223.44" dur="7.2">that the mainstream media that the big</text>
  <text start="226.08" dur="6.06">tech that the liberal demonstrate to</text>
