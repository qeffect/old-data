  <text start="0.41" dur="9.309">chapter 22 the brightest day for almost</text>
  <text start="6.87" dur="4.68">60 days I waited in jail during that</text>
  <text start="9.719" dur="4.231">time emit various people that I was able</text>
  <text start="11.55" dur="4.559">to share my faith with but by the time I</text>
  <text start="13.95" dur="4.35">emerged from jail after two long months</text>
  <text start="16.109" dur="4.83">of virtual non-stop living in a cement</text>
  <text start="18.3" dur="5.37">block I had never been so grateful for</text>
  <text start="20.939" dur="5.311">freedom I remember that early summer</text>
  <text start="23.67" dur="5.01">evening so well the sky a pink gauze</text>
  <text start="26.25" dur="5.55">painted with just a few threads of wispy</text>
  <text start="28.68" dur="4.62">clouds yawned so wyd above me I walked</text>
  <text start="31.8" dur="3.99">down a quiet street leading away from</text>
  <text start="33.3" dur="5.55">the jail the air seems so still so</text>
  <text start="35.79" dur="5.13">incredibly peaceful a few birds chirped</text>
  <text start="38.85" dur="4.619">and I silently thanked you for pulling</text>
  <text start="40.92" dur="5.7">me through that adversity a half hour</text>
  <text start="43.469" dur="5.82">later my landlord Michael picked me up</text>
  <text start="46.62" dur="7.079">and treated me to a nice dinner I had</text>
  <text start="49.289" dur="6.09">become I had become utterly convinced</text>
  <text start="53.699" dur="3.301">that Annika had blaspheme the Holy</text>
  <text start="55.379" dur="3.871">Spirit there was no chance for her to</text>
  <text start="57" dur="3.78">repent but upon retrospect I think</text>
  <text start="59.25" dur="3.09">perhaps this was just my only way of</text>
  <text start="60.78" dur="3.54">dealing with the incredible pain that</text>
  <text start="62.34" dur="3.87">wracked my heart cut off from my</text>
  <text start="64.32" dur="3.45">children I would now need to go through</text>
  <text start="66.21" dur="3.12">the long process of filing court</text>
  <text start="67.77" dur="4.139">hearings just so that I could be able to</text>
  <text start="69.33" dur="4.02">see them when Annika divorced me I had</text>
  <text start="71.909" dur="3.57">not considered custody to be a high</text>
  <text start="73.35" dur="3.72">priority because I was certain we were</text>
  <text start="75.479" dur="4.111">eventually going to work things out and</text>
  <text start="77.07" dur="4.14">custody would become a moot point I knew</text>
  <text start="79.59" dur="3.24">the task was going to be even harder now</text>
  <text start="81.21" dur="4.11">that I had this arrest on my record for</text>
  <text start="82.83" dur="4.02">violating the restraining order so now I</text>
  <text start="85.32" dur="3.99">entered a period of months in which a</text>
  <text start="86.85" dur="4.199">protective shell grew over my heart all</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="4.14">I knew was I needed to fight for my</text>
  <text start="91.049" dur="4.231">children somehow amazing and</text>
  <text start="93.45" dur="4.5">miraculously yah sustained me through</text>
  <text start="95.28" dur="4.56">this time while I was saddened by not</text>
  <text start="97.95" dur="4.11">seeing the children I was not reduced to</text>
  <text start="99.84" dur="4.65">sob and grief because it was as if yah</text>
  <text start="102.06" dur="4.32">had shut off a part of my heart I think</text>
  <text start="104.49" dur="3.449">this was his way of protecting me along</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="3.36">with this shutting off of my heart i</text>
  <text start="107.939" dur="3.481">nurtured the conviction that Annika had</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="3.96">completely and totally turned away from</text>
  <text start="111.42" dur="5.79">yah and that reconciliation would be</text>
  <text start="113.7" dur="5.15">impossible however little did I know the</text>
  <text start="117.21" dur="4.909">self-protective belief</text>
  <text start="118.85" dur="5.58">in to change during the latter half of</text>
  <text start="122.119" dur="4.591">2009 any form of ministry completely</text>
  <text start="124.43" dur="4.499">ground to a halt I&amp;#39;ve been cut off for</text>
  <text start="126.71" dur="4.35">my children lost my wife had no money to</text>
  <text start="128.929" dur="4.291">hire a lawyer I was certainly not</text>
  <text start="131.06" dur="3.6">depressed in fact I would say yah help</text>
  <text start="133.22" dur="3.72">me keep going with a supernaturally</text>
  <text start="134.66" dur="3.99">driven optimism but to do any form of</text>
  <text start="136.94" dur="4.92">ministry seemed too awesome a job at the</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="6.21">time Tabernacles of 2009 will lay the</text>
  <text start="141.86" dur="5.04">foundation for a coming change I&amp;#39;d spent</text>
  <text start="144.86" dur="3.66">the summer filing a cut no cause order</text>
  <text start="146.9" dur="3.6">to try and get some sort of custody of</text>
  <text start="148.52" dur="3.51">my children only to find out after</text>
  <text start="150.5" dur="3.45">waiting a couple months for the hearing</text>
  <text start="152.03" dur="3.33">that I could not legally seek custody</text>
  <text start="153.95" dur="3.78">while a restraining order was in place</text>
  <text start="155.36" dur="4.379">so now I had to file a new court order</text>
  <text start="157.73" dur="4.56">one to modify the restraining order just</text>
  <text start="159.739" dur="4.621">so I could see the children tabernacles</text>
  <text start="162.29" dur="4.41">of 2009 was a welcome seal off from the</text>
  <text start="164.36" dur="3.75">seemingly never-ending battle Michael</text>
