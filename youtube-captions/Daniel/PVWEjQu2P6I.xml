  <text start="51.899" dur="4.921">means tomorrow is a V of 10 now if you</text>
  <text start="55.23" dur="6.57">read your scriptures read the Torah</text>
  <text start="56.82" dur="7.559">you&amp;#39;ll find that Aviv 10 is a very</text>
  <text start="61.8" dur="5.429">special day it&amp;#39;s called lamb day and</text>
  <text start="64.379" dur="5.191">that is the day that the Torah commands</text>
  <text start="67.229" dur="4.111">the children of Israel commands us we</text>
  <text start="69.57" dur="4.32">are by the way the children of Israel</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="4.59">Ephesians 2 says that even if we were</text>
  <text start="73.89" dur="3.839">born Gentile as long as we&amp;#39;re covered by</text>
  <text start="75.93" dur="3.81">the blood of Yahshua we are grafted into</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="3.241">the Commonwealth of Israel which means</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="3.33">all the commandments that were given to</text>
  <text start="80.97" dur="5.55">Israel back in the tour the Tanakh are</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="7.71">now given to us as followers of Messiah</text>
  <text start="86.52" dur="6.27">Yahshua Jesus in any case the Torah</text>
  <text start="90.78" dur="4.47">talks about how Aviv 10 the tenth day</text>
  <text start="92.79" dur="5.67">Vavi which happens this year happens</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="5.04">tomorrow or starting tonight is lamb day</text>
  <text start="98.46" dur="5.189">and that is the day that you select your</text>
  <text start="100.29" dur="6.719">lamb it has to be a one year old lamb</text>
  <text start="103.649" dur="5.58">without blemish you select that lamb you</text>
  <text start="107.009" dur="6.451">get to know it from a view of 10 through</text>
  <text start="109.229" dur="6.541">a be 14 next four days and on a v14 of</text>
  <text start="113.46" dur="4.38">course which is Passover that is the day</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="3.68">that you slaughter the lamb and you</text>
  <text start="117.84" dur="6.349">slaughter it during the day just as</text>
  <text start="119.45" dur="7.51">Yahshua hung on the tree during a v14</text>
  <text start="124.189" dur="5.141">2,000 years ago you slaughter that lamb</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="4.47">and then as evening comes and Passover</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="3.33">turns into the high shabbat which is the</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="3.78">first day of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="132.66" dur="6.54">you eat the Passover lamb along with</text>
  <text start="135.21" dur="5.61">bitter herbs and matzah and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="139.2" dur="4.47">what&amp;#39;s commanded in Exodus chapter 12</text>
  <text start="140.82" dur="5.07">and Leviticus 23 for the Passover exes</text>
  <text start="143.67" dur="5.58">12 Seder meal we&amp;#39;ll get more into that</text>
  <text start="145.89" dur="5.64">as Passover continues but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s cool</text>
  <text start="149.25" dur="7.26">that tomorrow is a vivre 10 lamb day</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="7.5">because lamb day of course now as I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="5.07">explained earlier because the calendar</text>
  <text start="159.03" dur="5.12">is based on you know the first new moon</text>
  <text start="161.58" dur="4.86">after the spring equinox every year</text>
  <text start="164.15" dur="4.57">these feast days fault differently</text>
  <text start="166.44" dur="4.65">depending on when that new moon happens</text>
  <text start="168.72" dur="5.64">and in relation to the equinox every</text>
  <text start="171.09" dur="5.52">year so you know every year you have</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="4.77">Passover anywhere from you know early</text>
  <text start="176.61" dur="5.22">early April to as late as late April</text>
  <text start="179.13" dur="5.19">going into may just depending on the</text>
  <text start="181.83" dur="5.43">year well in the year that Yahshua was</text>
  <text start="184.32" dur="5.58">crucified Aviv 10 actually fell on a</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="4.41">Sabbath on a weekly Shabbat it actually</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="3.57">fell in like a day like today now it</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="5.19">doesn&amp;#39;t do that this year but but on</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="5.91">that year it did and so that day when he</text>
  <text start="196.86" dur="5.22">rode into Jerusalem on that donkey it</text>
  <text start="199.38" dur="4.41">was Palm Sabbath okay so get out of your</text>
  <text start="202.08" dur="3.54">head Palm Sunday that never happened but</text>
  <text start="203.79" dur="3.81">it was Palm Shabbat and what&amp;#39;s cool</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="3.6">about that is that you know Aviv 10 is</text>
  <text start="207.6" dur="3.03">the day that you pick your lamb you</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="3.33">inspect it you make sure there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="210.63" dur="4.32">blemish you make sure it&amp;#39;s a one year</text>
  <text start="212.55" dur="4.77">old male lamb or it could be a good as</text>
  <text start="214.95" dur="4.53">well but a one year old male lamb that</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="5.61">is without blemish and that was the very</text>
  <text start="219.48" dur="6.18">day that Yahshua road on his donkey into</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="5.34">Jerusalem and he was inspected eeo</text>
  <text start="225.66" dur="5.28">everyone was raving those palm branches</text>
  <text start="228.27" dur="4.58">and you know hoshana rabba oshadi are</text>
  <text start="230.94" dur="4.769">not pushed out a robot Oh Shona yeah</text>
  <text start="232.85" dur="5.17">oceania yahoo shana yayuh they&amp;#39;re crying</text>
  <text start="235.709" dur="5.731">out yeah yeah yeah and declaring that</text>
  <text start="238.02" dur="4.8">yatra was was the king was Yahweh in the</text>
  <text start="241.44" dur="3.299">flesh and that&amp;#39;s what caused the</text>
  <text start="242.82" dur="5.07">Pharisees to grind their teeth and they</text>
  <text start="244.739" dur="4.741">were so angry but he was inspected when</text>
  <text start="247.89" dur="4.38">found to be without blemish of course</text>
  <text start="249.48" dur="4.5">and then after his victorious ride in</text>
  <text start="252.27" dur="3.36">Jerusalem he took that whip and went</text>
  <text start="253.98" dur="3.689">through the temple and also cleanse that</text>
  <text start="255.63" dur="5.31">temple removed the blemishes from the</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="6.87">temple at least for a period of time um</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="3.76">and so so its cool the parallel that you</text>
  <text start="264.539" dur="2.291">know</text>
  <text start="264.7" dur="3.84">joshua is showing that he is the lamb of</text>
  <text start="266.83" dur="3.9">course this year it doesn&amp;#39;t quite work</text>
  <text start="268.54" dur="3.84">that way this year a view 10 falls on</text>
  <text start="270.73" dur="3.87">tomorrow doesn&amp;#39;t fall on Shabbat but</text>
  <text start="272.38" dur="4.05">nevertheless this Shabbat which is the</text>
  <text start="274.6" dur="4.26">last shabbat before Passover which</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="5.61">occurs next week this is what this would</text>
  <text start="278.86" dur="6.33">be palm Sabbath so happy palm Sabbath</text>
  <text start="282.04" dur="6.24">everyone the day Yasha was inspected on</text>
  <text start="285.19" dur="5.01">this second early morning chat with</text>
  <text start="288.28" dur="5.34">Daniel Lee here on the second Sabbath of</text>
  <text start="290.2" dur="5.01">the the new year the shemitah year I</text>
  <text start="293.62" dur="5.64">want to talk about sort of some things</text>
  <text start="295.21" dur="6.78">that happen this week I I think I got</text>
  <text start="299.26" dur="7.26">more even more confirmation that this is</text>
  <text start="301.99" dur="7.56">the shemitah year and that is I I put up</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="6.54">a very controversial video earlier this</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="5.58">week exposing Paul Nissan Zachary Bauer</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="4.74">many other Hebrew roots leaders who held</text>
  <text start="315.13" dur="5.22">this conference in San Diego last</text>
  <text start="317.8" dur="4.74">weekend last shabbat and they had it in</text>
  <text start="320.35" dur="3.87">a hotel now they didn&amp;#39;t do any you know</text>
  <text start="322.54" dur="3.36">they assure me they didn&amp;#39;t do any buying</text>
  <text start="324.22" dur="3.69">or selling during the conference and I</text>
  <text start="325.9" dur="4.35">wasn&amp;#39;t accusing them of that anyway but</text>
  <text start="327.91" dur="4.98">the problem is they held it in a hotel</text>
  <text start="330.25" dur="3.9">number one they charged money now they</text>
  <text start="332.89" dur="2.82">did allow some people to come free but</text>
  <text start="334.15" dur="3.09">they charge money to various ministries</text>
  <text start="335.71" dur="4.55">and this is something Zachary Bauer</text>
  <text start="337.24" dur="5.67">confessed to me I mean he wrote that out</text>
  <text start="340.26" dur="4.6">and so they charge money which you never</text>
  <text start="342.91" dur="4.14">see an example of that in the scriptures</text>
  <text start="344.86" dur="4.17">of apostles or profits or anyone in the</text>
  <text start="347.05" dur="3.42">Brit nada Shah or the Tanakh where they</text>
  <text start="349.03" dur="3.63">hold a conference especially a</text>
  <text start="350.47" dur="3.48">conference for people to come who want</text>
  <text start="352.66" dur="3">to know the truth which is what they</text>
  <text start="353.95" dur="3.65">said this was all about and then they</text>
  <text start="355.66" dur="5.28">charge money to attend that&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="357.6" dur="5.5">and then also you know putting new</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="3.48">people who are just barely into Torah or</text>
  <text start="363.1" dur="3.21">just trying to learn about tore it into</text>
  <text start="364.42" dur="4.14">a hotel where there&amp;#39;s buying and selling</text>
  <text start="366.31" dur="3.66">going all around them and there&amp;#39;s hotel</text>
  <text start="368.56" dur="3.48">workers working stuff you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="369.97" dur="3.27">putting stumbling blocks in people&amp;#39;s way</text>
  <text start="372.04" dur="3.51">you&amp;#39;re putting stomach locks and people</text>
  <text start="373.24" dur="3.57">to break Shabbat as they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="375.55" dur="3.48">learn about shabbat it&amp;#39;s a horrible</text>
  <text start="376.81" dur="3.78">decision it de filed shabbat i rebuked</text>
  <text start="379.03" dur="3.96">paul and zachary and all of these guys</text>
  <text start="380.59" dur="4.65">and told them look you better repent for</text>
  <text start="382.99" dur="4.11">this and make sure next time if you do a</text>
  <text start="385.24" dur="4.53">conference it better be on a sunday or a</text>
  <text start="387.1" dur="5.52">weeknight but not on a shabbat and and</text>
  <text start="389.77" dur="5.91">all i got was just a million and</text>
  <text start="392.62" dur="5.04">and one excuses from Zachary Bauer from</text>
  <text start="395.68" dur="4.41">many many other people basically</text>
  <text start="397.66" dur="5.069">defending why they were able to defile</text>
  <text start="400.09" dur="5.549">Shabbat and it was so horrible so y&amp;#39;all</text>
  <text start="402.729" dur="4.711">rebuked them but what&amp;#39;s amazing is even</text>
  <text start="405.639" dur="3.661">though I was viciously attacked both on</text>
  <text start="407.44" dur="3.99">my Facebook page and on my youtube</text>
  <text start="409.3" dur="4.92">channel and by vicious I mean vicious I</text>
  <text start="411.43" dur="6.03">mean I had 153 comments within 24 hours</text>
  <text start="414.22" dur="5.64">on my on my video as I was trying to</text>
  <text start="417.46" dur="5.04">contend with people and on YouTube and i</text>
  <text start="419.86" dur="4.29">eventually had to ban those comments ida</text>
  <text start="422.5" dur="3.75">ban all comments just because they were</text>
  <text start="424.15" dur="5.04">getting so vicious and so wicked and so</text>
  <text start="426.25" dur="4.59">ugly but what was cool is that like one</text>
  <text start="429.19" dur="3.81">of the guys who is one of the most</text>
  <text start="430.84" dur="4.049">vicious guys of them all on my facebook</text>
  <text start="433" dur="3.6">he wound up turning he wound up</text>
  <text start="434.889" dur="4.111">basically repenting and humbling himself</text>
  <text start="436.6" dur="4.8">and aligning himself with what i was</text>
  <text start="439" dur="3.93">saying and that was amazing again i</text>
  <text start="441.4" dur="4.44">think that&amp;#39;s a proof of the shemitah</text>
  <text start="442.93" dur="4.89">year because i know in years past when</text>
  <text start="445.84" dur="3.24">i&amp;#39;ve been in a similar type of situation</text>
  <text start="447.82" dur="3.03">where I&amp;#39;ve had to fight off especially</text>
  <text start="449.08" dur="3.209">religious hypocrites which tend to be</text>
  <text start="450.85" dur="5.039">the worst by the way that&amp;#39;s why Yasha</text>
  <text start="452.289" dur="5.701">reserved his most searing scathing</text>
  <text start="455.889" dur="3.541">insults and name calling for the</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="3.51">religious hypocrites you know you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="459.43" dur="4.35">see him calling names to the woman</text>
  <text start="461.5" dur="4.62">caught in adultery or to the layman or</text>
  <text start="463.78" dur="4.29">the everyday person but boy if you go to</text>
  <text start="466.12" dur="3.66">Matthew 23 when he&amp;#39;s dealing with the</text>
  <text start="468.07" dur="3.15">religious leaders and the religious</text>
  <text start="469.78" dur="2.79">hardened hypocrites who think they know</text>
  <text start="471.22" dur="3.69">everything and yet they&amp;#39;re breaking</text>
  <text start="472.57" dur="4.92">Torah he lays into them calling them</text>
  <text start="474.91" dur="5.25">fools and vipers and you know just all</text>
  <text start="477.49" dur="4.95">sorts of things which is why I had to</text>
  <text start="480.16" dur="3.72">basically employ those tactics as I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="482.44" dur="3.599">dealing with these religious hypocrites</text>
  <text start="483.88" dur="3.33">and keep in mind we&amp;#39;re not talking about</text>
  <text start="486.039" dur="2.491">people who are new to tour we&amp;#39;re talk</text>
  <text start="487.21" dur="3.66">about people who&amp;#39;ve claimed walking tour</text>
  <text start="488.53" dur="4.05">for years and yet here they are</text>
  <text start="490.87" dur="3.54">flagrantly breaking the fourth</text>
  <text start="492.58" dur="3.57">commandment the Shabbat of all</text>
  <text start="494.41" dur="5.129">commitments and the shabbat is the sign</text>
  <text start="496.15" dur="5.34">of the Covenant in any case one of them</text>
  <text start="499.539" dur="5.94">one of them actually turned on Facebook</text>
  <text start="501.49" dur="5.609">and and and and I did have to block a</text>
  <text start="505.479" dur="3.511">few people but eventually things quite a</text>
  <text start="507.099" dur="4.111">doubt and then like I said on on YouTube</text>
  <text start="508.99" dur="3.96">unfortunately I did have to ban those</text>
  <text start="511.21" dur="3.449">comments and it is unfortunate because</text>
  <text start="512.95" dur="3.69">there were some good comments on there</text>
  <text start="514.659" dur="5.13">but I had to because people were just</text>
  <text start="516.64" dur="6.209">being so wicked and so vicious and just</text>
  <text start="519.789" dur="5.701">I mean for example one guy was saying</text>
  <text start="522.849" dur="3.141">well yo where&amp;#39;s the scripture how do you</text>
  <text start="525.49" dur="2.57">know we</text>
  <text start="525.99" dur="3.57">can&amp;#39;t buy or sell on Shabbat you know</text>
  <text start="528.06" dur="4.08">and I kept bringing up just the last</text>
  <text start="529.56" dur="4.44">chapter in Nehemiah just that one alone</text>
  <text start="532.14" dur="4.319">I mean where Nehemiah tears out the</text>
  <text start="534" dur="4.11">beards of men who are attempting to</text>
  <text start="536.459" dur="5.25">break the sabbath to buy and sell the</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="6">Sabbath and and emi is ripping up their</text>
  <text start="541.709" dur="4.081">beards for doing that and the guy was</text>
  <text start="544.11" dur="3.9">like well come on that&amp;#39;s not Torah I</text>
  <text start="545.79" dur="4.56">mean as if Nehemiah didn&amp;#39;t know Torah I</text>
  <text start="548.01" dur="3.9">mean give me a break and by the way</text>
  <text start="550.35" dur="3.299">there are two are references to not</text>
  <text start="551.91" dur="4.049">buying and selling a Shabbat it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="553.649" dur="4.111">book of Exodus and these people knew</text>
  <text start="555.959" dur="3.721">that but there&amp;#39;s just so they&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="557.76" dur="3.84">puffed up there so puffed up they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="559.68" dur="3.06">even know who yacht is you know and</text>
  <text start="561.6" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s one of the problems in the</text>

  <text start="601.1" dur="5.5">basically make excuses for their sin you</text>
  <text start="604.5" dur="4.68">know the number one they were wanting to</text>
  <text start="606.6" dur="4.92">allow women to teach at in a meal a</text>
  <text start="609.18" dur="5.64">teaching pastoral role which flagrantly</text>
  <text start="611.52" dur="6.15">disobeyed 1st Timothy 2 which Paul bases</text>
  <text start="614.82" dur="4.38">on Genesis 3 which is Torah they wanted</text>
  <text start="617.67" dur="3.69">to do that and making all these excuses</text>
  <text start="619.2" dur="4.259">for why it&amp;#39;s okay and how they feel</text>
  <text start="621.36" dur="3.84">called as a woman to teach and give me a</text>

  <text start="625.2" dur="3.629">it&amp;#39;s against the Torah just like these</text>
  <text start="626.91" dur="4.11">people at the conference oh so many</text>
  <text start="628.829" dur="4.141">people grew and we we baptize people in</text>
  <text start="631.02" dur="4.86">water it doesn&amp;#39;t matter you&amp;#39;re breaking</text>
  <text start="632.97" dur="5.489">Torah so it&amp;#39;s wrong but that was going</text>
  <text start="635.88" dur="5.16">on in the home fellowship and then there</text>
  <text start="638.459" dur="3.781">was this woman who felt like she could</text>
  <text start="641.04" dur="3.45">leave her husband she said that her</text>
  <text start="642.24" dur="4.469">husband had been abusing her which</text>
  <text start="644.49" dur="3.539">obviously abuse is wrong and she had</text>
  <text start="646.709" dur="3.511">every right to leave the home and go</text>
  <text start="648.029" dur="4.171">stay with her friends in Ohio which is</text>
  <text start="650.22" dur="4.619">where she and her husband live but no</text>
  <text start="652.2" dur="5.37">she came 3,000 miles lived with her</text>
  <text start="654.839" dur="4.421">parents and then starts telling me that</text>
  <text start="657.57" dur="4">oh my husband needs to</text>
  <text start="659.26" dur="4.26">humble himself and and and and woo me</text>
  <text start="661.57" dur="3.84">and remarry me and do all jump through</text>
  <text start="663.52" dur="3.86">all these hoops like I mean wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="665.41" dur="4.43">scriptural just this feminist feminazi</text>
  <text start="667.38" dur="4.81">feminism spirit of feminism wasn&amp;#39;t Torah</text>
  <text start="669.84" dur="3.85">first of all Torah says you leave your</text>
  <text start="672.19" dur="4.02">mother and your father to join under</text>
  <text start="673.69" dur="4.23">your spouse a man leaves his mom and dad</text>
  <text start="676.21" dur="4.83">to join into a spouse I assume that</text>
  <text start="677.92" dur="4.65">applies to the woman as well and instead</text>
  <text start="681.04" dur="4.08">we see the reverse happening where this</text>
  <text start="682.57" dur="4.77">particular girl leaves her husband</text>
  <text start="685.12" dur="3.78">travels 3,000 miles from Ohio to Oregon</text>
  <text start="687.34" dur="3.27">to be with her parents and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="688.9" dur="3.69">defending it like oh no this is the best</text>
  <text start="690.61" dur="4.17">thing and that it well the fact is if</text>
  <text start="692.59" dur="3.81">she had just left the house and gone to</text>
  <text start="694.78" dur="4.25">safety right there she had many friends</text>
  <text start="696.4" dur="5.16">in Ohio it would have much more easily</text>
  <text start="699.03" dur="4.39">facilitated reconciliation instead of</text>
  <text start="701.56" dur="3.45">being 3,000 miles away was wrong his</text>
  <text start="703.42" dur="2.88">wickedness and I kept telling this group</text>
  <text start="705.01" dur="3.24">that and they of course they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="706.3" dur="3.93">to listen to that fortunately in praise</text>
  <text start="708.25" dur="3.27">yah I&amp;#39;ve gotten reports that she is</text>
  <text start="710.23" dur="2.91">going to be going back to her husband</text>
  <text start="711.52" dur="3.63">and reconciling so I&amp;#39;m very thankful for</text>
  <text start="713.14" dur="4.23">that but they&amp;#39;re still trying to defend</text>
  <text start="715.15" dur="3.66">this woman staying away from her husband</text>
  <text start="717.37" dur="3.27">this long and it&amp;#39;s wrong I mean this is</text>
  <text start="718.81" dur="4.17">how the world does things it&amp;#39;s not how</text>
  <text start="720.64" dur="6">Torah not how the scripture shows how to</text>
  <text start="722.98" dur="5.94">do things so that was going on and and</text>
  <text start="726.64" dur="3.75">just you know the this type of stuff</text>
  <text start="728.92" dur="2.85">shouldn&amp;#39;t be going on whether it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="730.39" dur="3.21">home fellowship groups whether it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="731.77" dur="3.81">you know conferences that Hebrew roots</text>
  <text start="733.6" dur="4.44">leaders are putting on this is the sin</text>
  <text start="735.58" dur="5.13">that yeah is sick of and we as people</text>
  <text start="738.04" dur="5.76">who follow Torah and love Yahshua you</text>
  <text start="740.71" dur="4.74">know we should be examples especially</text>
  <text start="743.8" dur="4.11">those of us who have been doing this for</text>
  <text start="745.45" dur="3.81">any number a period of time and that was</text>
  <text start="747.91" dur="3.96">the other issue is that especially with</text>
  <text start="749.26" dur="4.26">this home fellowship group I was the one</text>
  <text start="751.87" dur="4.65">who&amp;#39;d been walking in tour the longest</text>
  <text start="753.52" dur="4.47">you know 15 years even the leader the</text>
  <text start="756.52" dur="3.09">so-called leader well not maybe the</text>
  <text start="757.99" dur="3.21">leader but the de facto leader the one</text>
  <text start="759.61" dur="3.15">who does a lot of the teachings he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="761.2" dur="3.36">only been doing tour for eight years and</text>
  <text start="762.76" dur="3.6">the people that I was talking to that</text>
  <text start="764.56" dur="4.38">invited me over to this dinner earlier</text>
  <text start="766.36" dur="5.1">this week at their home they&amp;#39;d only been</text>
  <text start="768.94" dur="3.3">walking into her for a year and yet they</text>
  <text start="771.46" dur="2.64">think they know what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="772.24" dur="3.15">there&amp;#39;s another couple that I used to</text>
  <text start="774.1" dur="2.55">fellowship with and they&amp;#39;ve only been</text>
  <text start="775.39" dur="5.4">walking into her for a little over a</text>
  <text start="776.65" dur="5.7">year and they&amp;#39;re a young couple that I</text>
  <text start="780.79" dur="4.2">really grew close to but they you know</text>
  <text start="782.35" dur="4.47">the the wife got on Facebook and put a</text>
  <text start="784.99" dur="3.93">picture where her whole shoulder and</text>
  <text start="786.82" dur="4.35">breasts were just exposed and this is a</text>
  <text start="788.92" dur="3.78">woman who made it her ministry to teach</text>
  <text start="791.17" dur="3">other women modesty</text>
  <text start="792.7" dur="3.51">when I try to gently correct her she</text>
  <text start="794.17" dur="3.72">just flies off like a Jezebel you know</text>
  <text start="796.21" dur="4.41">and her mom comes in and she starts</text>
  <text start="797.89" dur="5.43">defending her mom and man what a mess</text>
  <text start="800.62" dur="4.67">these are basic things that we as people</text>
  <text start="803.32" dur="4.11">who are walking in Torah should do and</text>
  <text start="805.29" dur="4.06">yet these people who&amp;#39;ve been barely</text>
  <text start="807.43" dur="4.44">walking in Torah they won&amp;#39;t even take</text>
  <text start="809.35" dur="5.46">the correction from someone like me who</text>
  <text start="811.87" dur="4.68">I&amp;#39;ve walked in torah for 15 years I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="814.81" dur="4.05">been street preaching open air preaching</text>
  <text start="816.55" dur="5.07">for 20 years I&amp;#39;ve been arrested seven</text>
  <text start="818.86" dur="5.76">times for the gospel I you know I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="821.62" dur="4.62">a ministry since 2003 so the last 13</text>
  <text start="824.62" dur="3.36">years of a ministry of consistent</text>
  <text start="826.24" dur="3.48">ministry with consistent articles and I</text>
  <text start="827.98" dur="3.66">mean I&amp;#39;ve been through this stuff and</text>
  <text start="829.72" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;m not trying to do boast or exalt</text>
  <text start="831.64" dur="3.72">myself but you know Paul laid out his</text>
  <text start="834.04" dur="3.09">credentials you know he said he was from</text>
  <text start="835.36" dur="3.36">the tribe of Benjamin and listed those</text>
  <text start="837.13" dur="3.27">credentials and he said I counted all is</text>
  <text start="838.72" dur="3.42">nothing and of course I count all my</text>
  <text start="840.4" dur="4.17">stuff has nothing I&amp;#39;m just grateful yah</text>
  <text start="842.14" dur="3.66">sure saved me but the point is I wish</text>
  <text start="844.57" dur="3.18">people would listen to what I have to</text>
