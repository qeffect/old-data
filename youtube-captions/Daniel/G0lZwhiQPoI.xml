  <text start="82.409" dur="4.53">remember any of the prophets like Isaiah</text>

  <text start="108.21" dur="3.659">but for some reason he has me blocked</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="4.32">when I have no idea why he has me block</text>
  <text start="111.869" dur="4.441">that I don&amp;#39;t ever remember interacting</text>
  <text start="113.939" dur="5.401">with Scotty or posting a comment on his</text>
  <text start="116.31" dur="4.23">videos or anything maybe I did a long</text>

  <text start="120.54" dur="7.079">know but anyway he has me blocked so</text>
  <text start="124.85" dur="4.749">there you go but anyway he should not be</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="4.111">making merchandise of the word of yeah</text>
  <text start="129.599" dur="2.491">that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the first thing first</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="4.589">air</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="6.69">that one should see in Scotty now I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="136.319" dur="5.551">watched a few of Scotty&amp;#39;s videos and he</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="4.98">makes it very very clear that he</text>
  <text start="141.87" dur="4.68">believes the rapture happens before the</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="4.41">tribulation and he says specifically</text>
  <text start="146.55" dur="4.11">that the rapture happens in Revelation</text>
  <text start="148.17" dur="4.02">chapter 4 now Scotty loves do you</text>
  <text start="150.66" dur="3.659">sarcasm so I&amp;#39;m just gonna use sarcasm</text>
  <text start="152.19" dur="4.769">right back with him</text>
  <text start="154.319" dur="7.5">geez Scotty you read Revelation chapter</text>
  <text start="156.959" dur="7.171">4 I really don&amp;#39;t see a rapture here it</text>
  <text start="161.819" dur="4.591">says after this I this is the author</text>
  <text start="164.13" dur="4.53">speaking who would be John Paul John I</text>
  <text start="166.41" dur="4.38">looked and behold a door was opened in</text>
  <text start="168.66" dur="4.2">heaven and the first voice which I heard</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="4.38">was as it were of a trumpet talking with</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="4.379">me which said come up hither and I will</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="4.26">show thee things which must be Hereafter</text>
  <text start="177.239" dur="3.72">and immediately I again this is talking</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="4.11">about the author the person who wrote</text>
  <text start="180.959" dur="4.441">this which was John I John was in the</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="4.38">spirit and behold a throne was set in</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="4.08">heaven and one sat on the throne and he</text>
  <text start="187.92" dur="3.929">that sat was to look upon like a Jasper</text>
  <text start="189.48" dur="4.02">and a sardine stone and there was a</text>
  <text start="191.849" dur="4.381">rainbow round about the throne in sight</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="4.98">like unto an emerald and then it goes on</text>
  <text start="196.23" dur="5.31">to describe the throne the throne room</text>
  <text start="198.48" dur="5.069">that John finds himself in this in no</text>
  <text start="201.54" dur="6.93">way describes the rapture Scottie this</text>
  <text start="203.549" dur="7.02">is John the author describing him being</text>
  <text start="208.47" dur="4.349">called up into the heavenly throne room</text>
  <text start="210.569" dur="3.871">to behold a vision of the things that</text>
  <text start="212.819" dur="4.14">are going to happen there hereafter I</text>
  <text start="214.44" dur="4.769">don&amp;#39;t know how you can possibly get the</text>
  <text start="216.959" dur="4.89">rapture from this it doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="219.209" dur="4.381">sense at all I will show you where the</text>
  <text start="221.849" dur="4.92">rapture occurs and look a revelation and</text>
  <text start="223.59" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s very clear Apostle John and Apostle</text>
  <text start="226.769" dur="4.05">Paul were very very close buddies okay</text>
  <text start="229.23" dur="4.92">they knew each other on a very intimate</text>
  <text start="230.819" dur="6.39">basis and they both use the same exact</text>
  <text start="234.15" dur="7.199">wording to describe the resurrection /</text>
  <text start="237.209" dur="7.351">rapture now Scottie agrees that first</text>
  <text start="241.349" dur="5.401">Corinthians chapter 15 is describing the</text>
  <text start="244.56" dur="3.66">rapture the resurrection and I agree</text>
  <text start="246.75" dur="3.72">that it&amp;#39;s definitely describing the</text>
  <text start="248.22" dur="6.06">resurrection in fact we read Paul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.47" dur="8.16">words in first Corinthians 15 starting</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="7.5">in verse 51 behold I show you a mystery</text>
  <text start="258.63" dur="5.219">remember that word mystery behold I show</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="3.78">you a mystery we shall not all sleep but</text>
  <text start="263.849" dur="3.241">we shall all be changed</text>
  <text start="265.56" dur="4.02">in a moment in the twinkling of an eye</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="4.14">at the last Trump for the trumpet shall</text>
  <text start="269.58" dur="5.46">sound and the dead shall be raised</text>
  <text start="271.23" dur="6.18">incorruptible and we shall be changed ok</text>
  <text start="275.04" dur="4.379">so Scotty does acknowledge that this is</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="3.75">describing the resurrection rapture now</text>
  <text start="279.419" dur="4.231">not as Paul says he&amp;#39;s gonna show us a</text>
  <text start="281.16" dur="5.09">mystery and then he describes what</text>
  <text start="283.65" dur="7.26">happens at the resurrection / rapture</text>
  <text start="286.25" dur="7.75">now John uses the same exact wording if</text>
  <text start="290.91" dur="6.03">you go to Revelation chapter 10 now in</text>
  <text start="294" dur="5.25">Revelation 9 8 and 9 you have the first</text>
  <text start="296.94" dur="3.87">six trumpets being blown in the first</text>
  <text start="299.25" dur="3.63">half of Revelation 10 you then have</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="3.84">seven thunders being uttered and then</text>
  <text start="302.88" dur="4.68">you have the seventh angel sounding and</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="6">look what John writes in Revelation 10</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="5.58">verse 7 but in the days of the voice of</text>
  <text start="310.65" dur="5.82">the seventh angel when he shall begin to</text>
  <text start="313.14" dur="5.79">sound the mystery oh there&amp;#39;s that word</text>
  <text start="316.47" dur="4.53">mystery the mystery of yah should be</text>
  <text start="318.93" dur="5.43">finished as he had declared to the</text>
  <text start="321" dur="6.21">servants the prophets hmm</text>
  <text start="324.36" dur="6.059">so John says when the seventh angel</text>
  <text start="327.21" dur="4.56">blows his seventh trumpets the mystery</text>
  <text start="330.419" dur="2.881">of yah have you finished what is the</text>
  <text start="331.77" dur="4.95">mystery of Yahoo we just read about it</text>
  <text start="333.3" dur="5.429">in first Corinthians chapter 15 it says</text>
  <text start="336.72" dur="3.5">behold I show you a mystery we shall not</text>
  <text start="338.729" dur="3.661">all sleep but we shall all be changed</text>
  <text start="340.22" dur="4.18">now we can find further confirmation</text>
  <text start="342.39" dur="3.39">because if we go on in Revelation we can</text>
  <text start="344.4" dur="3.96">read more about what happens at the</text>
  <text start="345.78" dur="4.139">seventh trumpet reading a little later</text>
  <text start="348.36" dur="4.08">in revelation 11 the very next chapter</text>
  <text start="349.919" dur="4.651">starting in verse 15 and the seventh</text>
  <text start="352.44" dur="4.38">angel sounded and there were great</text>
  <text start="354.57" dur="4.5">voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of</text>
  <text start="356.82" dur="4.71">this world are become the kingdoms of</text>
  <text start="359.07" dur="5.55">our outer nine of his Messiah and he</text>
  <text start="361.53" dur="4.74">shall reign forever and ever and the 24</text>
  <text start="364.62" dur="3.06">elders were sat before yah on their</text>
  <text start="366.27" dur="2.28">seats fell upon their faces and</text>
  <text start="367.68" dur="3.06">worshiped yah</text>
  <text start="368.55" dur="4.32">saying we give thanks oh I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="370.74" dur="4.2">Yahweh almighty which are and was and</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="3.54">are to come because you have taken to</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="4.17">the your great power and you have</text>
  <text start="376.41" dur="4.47">reigned and the nations were angry and</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="4.71">your wrath has come and the time of the</text>
  <text start="380.88" dur="4.409">Dead that they should be judged and that</text>
  <text start="383.82" dur="3.84">you should give reward unto your</text>
  <text start="385.289" dur="5.341">servants the prophets and to the Saints</text>
  <text start="387.66" dur="5.31">and them that fear your name small and</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="3.529">great and should destroy them which</text>
  <text start="392.97" dur="3.3">destroy the earth</text>
  <text start="394.159" dur="3.76">okay so we&amp;#39;re reading about what happens</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="2.91">at the seventh trumpet we we hear that</text>
  <text start="397.919" dur="5.571">basically all</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="7.62">leavers okay it says it says in verse 18</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="4.929">it&amp;#39;s the time of the dead and it and</text>
  <text start="406.8" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s the time that yah will give reward</text>
  <text start="408.419" dur="6.021">unto his prophets unto the Saints unto</text>
  <text start="411.96" dur="4.95">them that fear his name small and great</text>
  <text start="414.44" dur="4.03">it&amp;#39;s basically saying look this is the</text>
  <text start="416.91" dur="3.629">time where the believers are going to be</text>
  <text start="418.47" dur="3.569">rewarded well when do we get our rewards</text>
  <text start="420.539" dur="4.44">when were resurrected when were raptured</text>
  <text start="422.039" dur="4.621">when we meet Yahshua in the sky when</text>
  <text start="424.979" dur="3.991">were transformed in a twinkling of an</text>
  <text start="426.66" dur="7.74">eye just as Paul describes in first</text>
  <text start="428.97" dur="7.8">Corinthians 15 so Paul says he talks</text>
  <text start="434.4" dur="4.049">about a mystery Scottie agrees first</text>
  <text start="436.77" dur="3.75">Corinthians 15 is talking about the</text>
  <text start="438.449" dur="4.081">rapture resurrection John very clearly</text>
  <text start="440.52" dur="3.72">says when that mystery occurs it&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="442.53" dur="3.93">the seventh trumpet the set when the</text>
  <text start="444.24" dur="4.98">seventh angel blows and that seventh</text>
  <text start="446.46" dur="6">trumpet will occur at the end of the</text>
  <text start="449.22" dur="4.979">tribulation not before so Scottie and</text>
  <text start="452.46" dur="3.269">all his followers I hate to burst your</text>
  <text start="454.199" dur="4.59">bubble there will be no rapture a</text>
  <text start="455.729" dur="4.41">resurrection in September of 2013 there</text>

  <text start="460.139" dur="5.571">rapture in 2014 there&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="462.84" dur="6.03">a resurrection eruption in 2015 or 2016</text>
  <text start="465.71" dur="6.79">however on the Feast of Trumpets yom</text>
