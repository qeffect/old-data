  <text start="125.61" dur="6.05">have two other feasts that that that</text>
  <text start="128.3" dur="5.64">merge that are very important one was</text>
  <text start="131.66" dur="4.53">the feast of Purim which came about in</text>
  <text start="133.94" dur="3.96">the book of Esther and this was</text>
  <text start="136.19" dur="3.45">something that yah established through</text>
  <text start="137.9" dur="3.54">Mordecai and Esther who were both</text>
  <text start="139.64" dur="4.38">mightily filled with the Holy Spirit and</text>
  <text start="141.44" dur="4.53">who both you know certified this this</text>
  <text start="144.02" dur="5.07">these two days that are actually</text>
  <text start="145.97" dur="4.77">commanded Sabbath days um perm is not an</text>
  <text start="149.09" dur="2.85">option it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a commandment and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="150.74" dur="2.82">in the book of Esther even though it</text>
  <text start="151.94" dur="4.83">wasn&amp;#39;t given in the days of the Torah</text>
  <text start="153.56" dur="5.52">necessarily it was later revelation that</text>
  <text start="156.77" dur="4.2">came through through things and and perm</text>
  <text start="159.08" dur="5.12">does have some key prophetic</text>
  <text start="160.97" dur="6.15">significance that are important for us</text>
  <text start="164.2" dur="5.14">however the other feast is hanukkah now</text>
  <text start="167.12" dur="4.11">when I bring up Hanukkah people say well</text>
  <text start="169.34" dur="3.51">wait a minute Daniel I don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="3.24">Hanukkah anywhere in the scriptures you</text>
  <text start="172.85" dur="3.45">can&amp;#39;t there&amp;#39;s not a book related to it</text>
  <text start="174.47" dur="3.21">you know the only mention of is in first</text>
  <text start="176.3" dur="2.79">and second Maccabees and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="177.68" dur="3.42">those are historical books in the</text>
  <text start="179.09" dur="3.99">Maccabees and that&amp;#39;s not even part of</text>
  <text start="181.1" dur="3.48">our cannon anymore I mean maybe you can</text>
  <text start="183.08" dur="3.12">find some Catholic Bible with the</text>
  <text start="184.58" dur="3.42">person&amp;#39;s technically but come on Daniel</text>
  <text start="186.2" dur="6.539">hanukkah&amp;#39;s nada you can&amp;#39;t impose that</text>
  <text start="188" dur="13.14">well I&amp;#39;ll come threat because in John</text>
  <text start="192.739" dur="10.801">chapter 10 the Gospels in verse 22 we</text>
  <text start="201.14" dur="6.84">see very very clear proof that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="203.54" dur="6.57">himself yash of Nazareth celebrated this</text>
  <text start="207.98" dur="5.52">Hanukkah feast or otherwise known as the</text>
  <text start="210.11" dur="5.849">piece of dedication in John 10 verse 22</text>
  <text start="213.5" dur="4.32">it says and it was at Jerusalem the</text>
  <text start="215.959" dur="6">feast of the dedication and it was</text>
  <text start="217.82" dur="7.169">winter and Yahshua walked in the temple</text>
  <text start="221.959" dur="4.951">in Solomon&amp;#39;s porch okay so we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="224.989" dur="5.071">going to stop right there so right here</text>
  <text start="226.91" dur="5.7">look if Yahshua did not accept the first</text>
  <text start="230.06" dur="4.56">and second Maccabees as accurate</text>
  <text start="232.61" dur="4.65">historical data and by this point it was</text>
  <text start="234.62" dur="3.93">about 180 years old he did not accept</text>
  <text start="237.26" dur="2.699">that if you do not think we should be</text>
  <text start="238.55" dur="3.75">involved in Hanukkah or seller in his</text>
  <text start="239.959" dur="5.191">fees he would not have come to the</text>
  <text start="242.3" dur="4.56">temple in jerusalem right during the</text>
  <text start="245.15" dur="3.119">feast he wouldn&amp;#39;t have done it okay or</text>
  <text start="246.86" dur="3.93">if he did he would have started saying</text>
  <text start="248.269" dur="4.171">hey stop you know stop celebrating this</text>
  <text start="250.79" dur="4.919">pagan feast what no he comes and he</text>
  <text start="252.44" dur="5.88">participates in it and my feeling is</text>
  <text start="255.709" dur="3.871">this if josh was going to go right to</text>
  <text start="258.32" dur="2.49">the heart of where these celebrations</text>
  <text start="259.58" dur="2.85">were occurring</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="2.79">okay and start teaching and preaching</text>
  <text start="262.43" dur="3.84">and we&amp;#39;re going to read about what he</text>
  <text start="263.6" dur="4.86">taught specifically here um then that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.27" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s enough proof for me that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="5.19">wants us to celebrate Hanukkah and</text>
  <text start="271.28" dur="4.859">indeed it is a extremely important feast</text>
  <text start="273.65" dur="4.98">how&amp;#39;s it going to touch on and a little</text>
  <text start="276.139" dur="4.891">bit as after we lay the foundation so</text>
  <text start="278.63" dur="5.25">before we read about what Yahshua did</text>
  <text start="281.03" dur="4.32">when he celebrated Hanukkah in the first</text>
  <text start="283.88" dur="4.259">century let&amp;#39;s talk about the first</text>
  <text start="285.35" dur="5.25">Hanukkah it was in the stipulated in</text>
  <text start="288.139" dur="5.851">first and second Maccabees you have the</text>
  <text start="290.6" dur="5.76">Greek Empire there the superpower of the</text>
  <text start="293.99" dur="6.63">day the mightiest aren&amp;#39;t on planet earth</text>
  <text start="296.36" dur="6.99">at the time and they over ran Israel</text>
  <text start="300.62" dur="5.58">they defile the temple they sacrificed a</text>
  <text start="303.35" dur="5">pig on the altar they forced the Jews to</text>
  <text start="306.2" dur="4.68">stop keeping Shabbat to start eating</text>
  <text start="308.35" dur="4.629">pork and shellfish I mean basically it</text>
  <text start="310.88" dur="4.5">was it was bad it was a complete</text>
  <text start="312.979" dur="4.531">defiling of the temple and then what</text>
  <text start="315.38" dur="3.81">happened is this small group of Jews</text>
  <text start="317.51" dur="4.59">known as The Maccabees they were from</text>
  <text start="319.19" dur="5.61">the tribe of Judah they leave that yah</text>
  <text start="322.1" dur="5.55">would help them overcome impossible odds</text>
  <text start="324.8" dur="4.83">and basically free Israel now much of</text>
  <text start="327.65" dur="4.829">Israel become compromised many of them</text>
  <text start="329.63" dur="5.37">decided just to work with the Greeks and</text>
  <text start="332.479" dur="5.341">just basically give up but the Maccabees</text>
  <text start="335" dur="4.83">refuse to do that and you read that</text>
  <text start="337.82" dur="4.71">through this guerrilla warfare it was</text>
  <text start="339.83" dur="5.28">like almost the original fourth of July</text>
  <text start="342.53" dur="5.46">if you will this small group of</text>
  <text start="345.11" dur="5.91">Maccabees through the power of yah they</text>
  <text start="347.99" dur="5.489">not only defeated the Greek Empire and</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="4.92">drove them out of Israel but they kept</text>
  <text start="353.479" dur="4.201">the Greeks out of Israel for good which</text>
  <text start="355.94" dur="3.53">is a miracle because I mean again we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="357.68" dur="3.75">talk about a superpower of the day and</text>
  <text start="359.47" dur="4.41">these Maccabees were severely</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="5.549">outnumbered and outgunned in any way um</text>
  <text start="363.88" dur="4.96">now Hanukkah itself is there was an</text>
  <text start="366.979" dur="4.351">eight-day period once they had driven</text>
  <text start="368.84" dur="3.69">the Greeks out once they got reset your</text>
  <text start="371.33" dur="3.27">Jerusalem of the temple there was an</text>
  <text start="372.53" dur="3.99">eight-day period that the Maccabees had</text>
  <text start="374.6" dur="3.51">to cleanse this temple which that</text>
  <text start="376.52" dur="3.899">cleanse the altar they got everything</text>
  <text start="378.11" dur="4.679">clean and perfect and pure and they were</text>
  <text start="380.419" dur="4.171">able to rededicate the altar it&amp;#39;s a time</text>
  <text start="382.789" dur="5.13">of purification of rededication of</text>
  <text start="384.59" dur="5.78">purity and so this season is always</text>
  <text start="387.919" dur="4.661">about rededicating yourself to you about</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="4.37">purifying your own temple</text>
  <text start="392.58" dur="3.869">your body or your spirit your soul it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.74" dur="3.54">about saying yeah I&amp;#39;m making my</text>
  <text start="396.449" dur="3.96">commitment again to you because of how</text>
  <text start="398.28" dur="4.199">you have helped me against the</text>
  <text start="400.409" dur="4.021">impossible odds of my sin and helped me</text>
  <text start="402.479" dur="4.291">to overcome and help me to drive back</text>
  <text start="404.43" dur="4.169">the wickedness of my sin through you and</text>
  <text start="406.77" dur="4.139">so it&amp;#39;s a time of Thanksgiving it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="408.599" dur="3.87">time of purity and rededication there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.909" dur="4.35">actually a beautiful song that I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="412.469" dur="6.45">to be sharing on Friday night when we</text>
  <text start="415.259" dur="5.31">start Hanukkah yah willing that by Marty</text>
  <text start="418.919" dur="4.02">Goetz who does this beautiful Hanukkah</text>

  <text start="425.58" dur="5.19">festival of you know you can do</text>
  <text start="427.889" dur="4.83">gift-giving you can you light up your</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="3.269">menorah because they lit up the manure</text>
  <text start="432.719" dur="3.6">for the first time in the temple when</text>
  <text start="434.039" dur="4.861">they rededicated it after I&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="436.319" dur="4.44">disuse for three and a half years so you</text>
  <text start="438.9" dur="3.59">light up your menorah you you do</text>
  <text start="440.759" dur="4.41">gift-giving now there is a lot of</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="5.079">paganism that have had seeped into the</text>
  <text start="445.169" dur="3.81">modern Judaism of Hanukkah where they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="447.569" dur="3.6">started doing the dreidels and they</text>
  <text start="448.979" dur="3.9">start they get into all sorts of stuff</text>
  <text start="451.169" dur="4.201">that you know they almost turn it into a</text>
  <text start="452.879" dur="4.951">Christmas and and so I I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="455.37" dur="3.24">that that&amp;#39;s good at all but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="457.83" dur="2.429">think there&amp;#39;s anything wrong with</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="3.45">gift-giving certainly nothing wrong with</text>
  <text start="460.259" dur="5.851">eight days of festival and rejoicing as</text>
  <text start="462.06" dur="6.21">you&amp;#39;re thinking and meditating about how</text>
  <text start="466.11" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;re to be pure and rededicate our</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="5.16">lives to Yahshua and exalt him so this</text>
  <text start="471.87" dur="4.229">is the basic mahadik at the time of the</text>
  <text start="473.43" dur="4.859">temple is cleansed now let&amp;#39;s go to what</text>
  <text start="476.099" dur="5.551">Yahshua did when he celebrated Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="478.289" dur="5.49">so going back to John 1022 we see that</text>
  <text start="481.65" dur="4.68">he&amp;#39;s at Jerusalem he&amp;#39;s at the feasts of</text>
  <text start="483.779" dur="5.521">the dedication the dedication of the</text>
  <text start="486.33" dur="4.679">temple basically it&amp;#39;s winter and by the</text>
  <text start="489.3" dur="3.6">way when it said that it was winter</text>
  <text start="491.009" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s very key especially this year</text>
  <text start="492.9" dur="4.049">because the rabbi&amp;#39;s decided to not</text>
  <text start="494.789" dur="3.84">follow Torah they started the year too</text>
  <text start="496.949" dur="3.27">early they didn&amp;#39;t wait for all the</text>
  <text start="498.629" dur="3.061">bride-to-be of even Israel they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="500.219" dur="3.42">wait for the first new moon after the</text>
  <text start="501.69" dur="3.479">equinox they didn&amp;#39;t regard Torah they</text>
  <text start="503.639" dur="3.15">could call their traditions and so</text>
  <text start="505.169" dur="3.691">that&amp;#39;s why they kept annika way back and</text>
  <text start="506.789" dur="4.111">Thanksgiving well Thanksgivings in the</text>
  <text start="508.86" dur="4.44">fall and it doesn&amp;#39;t happen in the fall</text>
  <text start="510.9" dur="5.84">according to John this is a feast that</text>
  <text start="513.3" dur="5.09">happens in the winter and so um</text>
  <text start="516.74" dur="3.12">so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="518.39" dur="5.04">celebrating Hanukkah and a couple of</text>
  <text start="519.86" dur="7.77">days here um now Yahshua walked in the</text>
  <text start="523.43" dur="5.61">temple in Solomon&amp;#39;s porch okay so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="527.63" dur="5.07">going to stop there i&amp;#39;m a segue into a</text>

  <text start="697.19" dur="5.2">doing the dimensions of course Kings</text>
  <text start="700.14" dur="6.12">don&amp;#39;t make sure you Slayer um so yeah so</text>

  <text start="706.26" dur="6.12">Kings match the dimensions that are in</text>
  <text start="708.06" dur="8.73">in of Noah&amp;#39;s Ark the 30 in the 50 cubits</text>
  <text start="712.38" dur="6.48">and and this porch is also the port that</text>
  <text start="716.79" dur="3.66">Yahshua stands on during Hanukkah and</text>
  <text start="718.86" dur="3.78">what that showed very clearly was how</text>
  <text start="720.45" dur="3.96">the art or this time of judgment and</text>
  <text start="722.64" dur="4.41">then with us carrying the ark is tied to</text>
  <text start="724.41" dur="5.19">the Solomon&amp;#39;s porch or even more</text>
  <text start="727.05" dur="3.66">importantly Hanukkah if you&amp;#39;ve seen some</text>
  <text start="729.6" dur="3.48">of the videos that I&amp;#39;ve made over the</text>
  <text start="730.71" dur="4.44">last month i firmly believe based off</text>
  <text start="733.08" dur="6.42">stellarium which shows the sign in the</text>
  <text start="735.15" dur="6.93">sky and off the meaning of Hanukkah that</text>
  <text start="739.5" dur="5.31">this Hanukkah December the 28th this</text>
  <text start="742.08" dur="5.79">Hanukkah Yahweh is going to celebrate</text>
  <text start="744.81" dur="5.97">Hanukkah by cleansing his heavenly</text>
  <text start="747.87" dur="5.97">tabernacle and casting Satan out of</text>
  <text start="750.78" dur="5.1">heaven what I mean by it is this for the</text>
  <text start="753.84" dur="4.05">past six thousand years Satan has been</text>
  <text start="755.88" dur="3.87">allowed to defile the heavenly</text>
  <text start="757.89" dur="4.02">Tabernacle by going into the throne room</text>
  <text start="759.75" dur="4.2">and accusing the Brethren day and night</text>
  <text start="761.91" dur="3.99">we know this because he did this in the</text>
  <text start="763.95" dur="4.26">book of joke he came right before the</text>
  <text start="765.9" dur="5.49">front of yacht he did this in the time</text>
  <text start="768.21" dur="4.62">of Yahshua yes Satan does walk to and</text>
  <text start="771.39" dur="3.84">fro across the earth but he also has</text>
  <text start="772.83" dur="4.95">access to the throne room and in second</text>
  <text start="775.23" dur="4.17">Thessalonians 2 Apostle Paul again talks</text>
  <text start="777.78" dur="3.81">about how Satan makes this rebellious</text>
  <text start="779.4" dur="4.47">and in the throne room accusing the</text>
  <text start="781.59" dur="5.07">Brethren day and night but that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="783.87" dur="4.77">is our advocate however in Revelation</text>
  <text start="786.66" dur="3.9">chapter 12 it says that at some point in</text>
  <text start="788.64" dur="3.69">our future riders were getting close to</text>
  <text start="790.56" dur="3.75">the Great Tribulation that last one half</text>
  <text start="792.33" dur="4.02">years that Yas going to give the</text>
  <text start="794.31" dur="4.74">go-ahead to Michael as our angels to</text>
  <text start="796.35" dur="5.13">cast Satan and his angels out of the</text>
  <text start="799.05" dur="3.54">throne room and basically they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="801.48" dur="2.43">going to any they&amp;#39;re not gonna have</text>
  <text start="802.59" dur="2.76">access to that throne room anymore</text>
  <text start="803.91" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re going to be cast down to earth</text>
  <text start="805.35" dur="4.98">and Satan&amp;#39;s gonna be really pissed</text>
  <text start="808.62" dur="3.9">because he&amp;#39;s going to know at that point</text>
  <text start="810.33" dur="3.87">his time is short he doesn&amp;#39;t have access</text>
  <text start="812.52" dur="3.55">to the throne her anymore and he&amp;#39;s told</text>
  <text start="814.2" dur="4.42">hatred now is going to go after</text>
  <text start="816.07" dur="5.13">the believers so I believe that this</text>
  <text start="818.62" dur="4.74">time is coming up this Hanukkah because</text>
  <text start="821.2" dur="3.75">of the and it would take a long time to</text>
  <text start="823.36" dur="4.77">explain all this but if you go to my</text>
  <text start="824.95" dur="4.56">website you&amp;#39;ll see why i believe 2017 is</text>
  <text start="828.13" dur="3.51">the next jubilee and why yash is</text>
  <text start="829.51" dur="3.45">returning so you have to back up three</text>
  <text start="831.64" dur="2.76">and a half years to get that Great</text>
  <text start="832.96" dur="5.21">Tribulation which would start in the</text>
  <text start="834.4" dur="7.35">late winter early spring of 2014 and</text>
  <text start="838.17" dur="5.38">basically at some point before that time</text>
  <text start="841.75" dur="2.85">Satan&amp;#39;s got to get cast down here</text>
  <text start="843.55" dur="3.18">because that&amp;#39;s at that point that he</text>
  <text start="844.6" dur="4.02">fills the son of perdition and I do</text>
  <text start="846.73" dur="4.92">believe on December the 28 because what</text>
  <text start="848.62" dur="4.62">happened was is I Ted another guide sky</text>
  <text start="851.65" dur="3.6">proof he wanted me to look up the NASA</text>
  <text start="853.24" dur="5.76">Stellarium of what the sign is in the</text>
  <text start="855.25" dur="5.67">sky on December 228 and so I did and it</text>
  <text start="859" dur="3.69">basically showed that mercury which is</text>
  <text start="860.92" dur="4.79">the planet of the covenants and the Sun</text>
  <text start="862.69" dur="5.82">is right anointing the forehead of</text>
  <text start="865.71" dur="5.89">Sagittarius which is sine of Satan it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="868.51" dur="5.01">this clovenfooted satire which is known</text>
  <text start="871.6" dur="3.72">as the sign of Satan and basically it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="873.52" dur="4.29">anointing his forehead and it&amp;#39;s making</text>
  <text start="875.32" dur="5.19">it look like Satan is anointed or wholly</text>
  <text start="877.81" dur="4.35">or beautiful and as soon as I saw that</text>
  <text start="880.51" dur="3.36">and I saw that it started right on</text>
  <text start="882.16" dur="4.26">December 228 and it goes like halfway</text>
  <text start="883.87" dur="3.78">through Hanukkah basically I just</text>
  <text start="886.42" dur="3.06">thought of the verse where he always</text>
  <text start="887.65" dur="4.17">says and I will I will send a great</text>
  <text start="889.48" dur="4.83">delusion upon them who have believed a</text>
  <text start="891.82" dur="3.75">lie and this illusion is all about you</text>
  <text start="894.31" dur="3.06">know people basically becoming</text>
  <text start="895.57" dur="4.53">mesmerised with Satan thinking that he</text>
  <text start="897.37" dur="4.38">is Yahweh and so it&amp;#39;s just like it all</text>
  <text start="900.1" dur="3.42">just sort of click together and I do</text>
  <text start="901.75" dur="3.24">believe that that&amp;#39;s going to happen now</text>
  <text start="903.52" dur="3.33">how is that going to manifest physically</text>
  <text start="904.99" dur="5.91">well that&amp;#39;s the big question i I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="906.85" dur="6.15">assumed that you know when anything</text>
  <text start="910.9" dur="4.56">happens spiritually like that that major</text>
  <text start="913" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s going to manifest physically and so</text>
  <text start="915.46" dur="2.52">I&amp;#39;ve assumed that this December</text>
  <text start="916.69" dur="5.15">twentieth something major is going to</text>
  <text start="917.98" dur="6.09">break out like possibly the psalm 83 war</text>
  <text start="921.84" dur="3.97">because I made another YouTube where</text>
  <text start="924.07" dur="4.86">yash only there&amp;#39;s exactly 83 days</text>
  <text start="925.81" dur="5.61">between yom teruah and Hanukkah this</text>
  <text start="928.93" dur="4.71">year in fact I was just on the news and</text>
  <text start="931.42" dur="3.9">i saw that there&amp;#39;s some Israeli Rockets</text>
  <text start="933.64" dur="3.3">being fired right now between Gaza and</text>
  <text start="935.32" dur="3.9">southern Israel and people are fleeing</text>
  <text start="936.94" dur="3.69">into bomb shelters and stuff granted</text>
  <text start="939.22" dur="3.87">that type of thing you know happens</text>
  <text start="940.63" dur="3.99">every once in a while anyway but my ears</text>
  <text start="943.09" dur="3.98">perked up because we&amp;#39;re now only two or</text>
  <text start="944.62" dur="4.75">three days out from from Hanukkah so</text>
  <text start="947.07" dur="5.959">that is my conviction and see</text>
  <text start="949.37" dur="5.909">like by tying the art dimensions to</text>
  <text start="953.029" dur="4.111">solomon&amp;#39;s porch and yacht of being on</text>
  <text start="955.279" dur="4.291">samus course during Hanukkah but it</text>
  <text start="957.14" dur="4.11">might again be another sign that you</text>
  <text start="959.57" dur="3.9">know you got to get on that art</text>
  <text start="961.25" dur="5.31">spiritually speaking and because the</text>
  <text start="963.47" dur="5.91">time of judgments here but in any case</text>
  <text start="966.56" dur="5.64">now I want to continue on with what</text>
  <text start="969.38" dur="10.62">Yahshua actually teaches at Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="972.2" dur="9.69">which is very important um so Jesus is</text>
  <text start="980" dur="4.589">in the temple in saugus verse verse 24</text>
  <text start="981.89" dur="9.72">John 10 verse 24 we&amp;#39;re still recording</text>
  <text start="984.589" dur="8.701">right um then came the roundabout yeah</text>
  <text start="991.61" dur="4.83">okay just making sure we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="993.29" dur="5.549">recording then came the Jews round about</text>
  <text start="996.44" dur="5.28">him and said unto Him how long does that</text>
  <text start="998.839" dur="6.031">make us to doubt if thou be the Messiah</text>
  <text start="1001.72" dur="5.46">the Christ tell us plainly and yash was</text>
  <text start="1004.87" dur="4.71">said unto them I told you and you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1007.18" dur="4.62">believe me and the works that I do in my</text>
  <text start="1009.58" dur="4.5">father&amp;#39;s name they bear witness of me</text>
  <text start="1011.8" dur="5.76">but you believe not because you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1014.08" dur="5.759">of my sheep as I said unto you my sheet</text>
  <text start="1017.56" dur="4.68">they hear my voice and I know them and</text>
  <text start="1019.839" dur="5.24">they follow me and I give unto them</text>
  <text start="1022.24" dur="5.25">eternal life and they shall never perish</text>
  <text start="1025.079" dur="6.071">neither shall any man pluck them out of</text>
  <text start="1027.49" dur="5.67">my hand my father which gave them to me</text>
  <text start="1031.15" dur="3.75">is greater than all and no man is able</text>
  <text start="1033.16" dur="5.73">to pluck them out of my father&amp;#39;s hand I</text>
  <text start="1034.9" dur="5.97">and my father are one then the Jews took</text>
  <text start="1038.89" dur="4.559">up the stones again to stone him and</text>
  <text start="1040.87" dur="4.079">Yahshua answered them said many good</text>
  <text start="1043.449" dur="3.331">works that I showed you for my father</text>
  <text start="1044.949" dur="4.171">for which of those works do you stone me</text>
  <text start="1046.78" dur="4.02">and the Jews answered him said for a</text>
  <text start="1049.12" dur="4.16">good work we stone you not but for</text>
  <text start="1050.8" dur="6.36">blasphemy and because you being a man</text>
  <text start="1053.28" dur="5.5">makest yourself yah and yasho answered</text>
  <text start="1057.16" dur="4.649">them and said is it not written in your</text>
  <text start="1058.78" dur="4.649">own Torah I said you were gods if he</text>
  <text start="1061.809" dur="3.181">called them gods I knew him the word of</text>
  <text start="1063.429" dur="4.141">yeah Kane and the scripture cannot be</text>
  <text start="1064.99" dur="4.86">broken say you a fin when the father is</text>
  <text start="1067.57" dur="4.32">sanctified and sent into the world you</text>
  <text start="1069.85" dur="5.01">blasphemous because i said i am the son</text>
  <text start="1071.89" dur="5.52">of yah if i do not the works of my</text>
  <text start="1074.86" dur="4.5">father&amp;#39;s believe me not my father</text>
  <text start="1077.41" dur="3.81">believed me not but if I do though you</text>
  <text start="1079.36" dur="2.5">believe not me at least believe the</text>
  <text start="1081.22" dur="2.77">works</text>
  <text start="1081.86" dur="5.22">that you may know and believe that the</text>
  <text start="1083.99" dur="5.22">father is in me and I in him therefore</text>
  <text start="1087.08" dur="4.53">they saw again to take him there still</text>
  <text start="1089.21" dur="4.5">wanted to kill him but he escaped out of</text>
  <text start="1091.61" dur="4.08">their hand and went away again beyond</text>
  <text start="1093.71" dur="3.93">the Jordan into the place where John</text>
  <text start="1095.69" dur="5.58">first was immersing and baptizing and</text>
  <text start="1097.64" dur="5.58">there he abode so this is very very</text>
  <text start="1101.27" dur="4.74">important as it relates to Hanukkah goes</text>
  <text start="1103.22" dur="3.78">first yash was saying look here is the</text>
  <text start="1106.01" dur="3.57">difference between the wheat in the</text>
  <text start="1107" dur="4.83">chaff okay and it comes right down to</text>
  <text start="1109.58" dur="4.08">this the Sheep hear me that she</text>

  <text start="1151.46" dur="6.39">to believe that Yahshua is yeah and so</text>
  <text start="1156.41" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s the first thing the difference</text>
  <text start="1157.85" dur="3.569">between is wheat in the chaff and what</text>
  <text start="1159.89" dur="3.84">is hanukkah about tonic is about</text>

  <text start="1163.73" dur="4.92">about yeah I&amp;#39;m purified in your site and</text>
  <text start="1166.04" dur="4.68">I also believe that this Annika is going</text>
  <text start="1168.65" dur="7.08">to be a big separation of the wheat in</text>
  <text start="1170.72" dur="9.75">the chaff as Satan gets cast down um but</text>
  <text start="1175.73" dur="8.189">then he says this he says that you know</text>

  <text start="1222.57" dur="6.69">Messiah the this man would also be yeah</text>

  <text start="1241.44" dur="4.77">that they let they coveted their</text>
  <text start="1242.94" dur="5.13">positions of power more and so they just</text>
  <text start="1246.21" dur="4.02">they remain obstinate steadfast I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1248.07" dur="4.8">convinced the face they did know Yahshua</text>
  <text start="1250.23" dur="4.77">was the Messiah they didn&amp;#39;t know it but</text>
  <text start="1252.87" dur="4.799">because they were so evil and wicked</text>
  <text start="1255" dur="4.02">they they basically they were so</text>
  <text start="1257.669" dur="3.961">coverages of their prison power they</text>
  <text start="1259.02" dur="4.2">they weren&amp;#39;t allowed to happen some of</text>
  <text start="1261.63" dur="3.69">them were honestly deceived you know I</text>
  <text start="1263.22" dur="4.23">mean Nicodemus he came to Yashiro by</text>
  <text start="1265.32" dur="3.599">night and eventually got the courage to</text>
  <text start="1267.45" dur="2.82">stand with Yahshua and there were there</text>
  <text start="1268.919" dur="3.931">are other Pharisees later in the first</text>
  <text start="1270.27" dur="4.769">century who did repent honestly but a</text>
  <text start="1272.85" dur="7.02">lot of these guys were just they were</text>
  <text start="1275.039" dur="6.571">just pure evil and so anyway so so he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1279.87" dur="3.24">eat you know equates himself with Jana</text>
  <text start="1281.61" dur="3.9">of course they want to stone him they</text>
  <text start="1283.11" dur="4.41">want to stone him and again yash reminds</text>
  <text start="1285.51" dur="3.72">them look why you stoning me all I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1287.52" dur="4.23">done is show love I&amp;#39;ve been healing</text>
  <text start="1289.23" dur="5.73">people I&amp;#39;ve been you know doing all this</text>
  <text start="1291.75" dur="4.679">great things to help Israel why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1294.96" dur="2.88">Tony me of course they say well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1296.429" dur="2.791">not saying because that we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1297.84" dur="4.05">telling you because you say you&amp;#39;re yah</text>
  <text start="1299.22" dur="4.709">he then quotes a song to them which this</text>
  <text start="1301.89" dur="4.32">song look of the exact song but the song</text>
  <text start="1303.929" dur="4.35">basically says have I not said you are</text>
  <text start="1306.21" dur="5.069">gods and you or die like men is</text>
  <text start="1308.279" dur="6.181">basically what he says so even proves</text>
  <text start="1311.279" dur="5.161">that in a psalm poetically men are</text>
  <text start="1314.46" dur="4.199">referred to as gods in a certain sense</text>
  <text start="1316.44" dur="5.04">but of course we know that we dies</text>
  <text start="1318.659" dur="6.361">mortals Yahshua does not because he is</text>
  <text start="1321.48" dur="5.64">Yahweh manifest in the flesh but he just</text>
  <text start="1325.02" dur="3.99">makes the point he said look if even the</text>
  <text start="1327.12" dur="3.75">Psalms refer to men who are mortal those</text>
  <text start="1329.01" dur="4.08">guys why why do you think it&amp;#39;s so crazy</text>
  <text start="1330.87" dur="4.59">that I who&amp;#39;ve done all these marvelous</text>
  <text start="1333.09" dur="4.29">works but quit myself with yah what why</text>
  <text start="1335.46" dur="3.39">is that so surprising to you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1337.38" dur="2.909">basically flinging the toilet to knock</text>
  <text start="1338.85" dur="5.4">back in their faces and saying what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1340.289" dur="6.171">wrong with you and then of course they</text>
  <text start="1344.25" dur="10.98">seek to to kill him to murder</text>
  <text start="1346.46" dur="10.45">again so Yasha makes it very clear those</text>
  <text start="1355.23" dur="3.78">who truly love him those who are truly</text>
  <text start="1356.91" dur="4.41">pure in their heart to you know it says</text>
  <text start="1359.01" dur="4.41">in the Beatitudes of Matthew 5 the pure</text>
  <text start="1361.32" dur="5.04">in heart will see yah what is hanukkah</text>
  <text start="1363.42" dur="6.09">all about being pure rededication being</text>
  <text start="1366.36" dur="5.34">pure before him and it is only the pure</text>
  <text start="1369.51" dur="4.65">hearts the sheep that can hear his voice</text>
  <text start="1371.7" dur="4.14">that know him and furthermore it&amp;#39;s those</text>
  <text start="1374.16" dur="3.96">sheep that no one could take out of his</text>
  <text start="1375.84" dur="3.63">hand you know he&amp;#39;s holding them close to</text>
  <text start="1378.12" dur="4.89">know if no one can take them out of his</text>
  <text start="1379.47" dur="7.26">hand but but then he&amp;#39;s facing off with</text>
  <text start="1383.01" dur="6.48">these religious hypocrites and um you</text>
  <text start="1386.73" dur="4.38">know again because of my belief my</text>
  <text start="1389.49" dur="3.36">strong conviction that yah has told me</text>
  <text start="1391.11" dur="5.52">that safe is being cast down this</text>
  <text start="1392.85" dur="5.82">Hanukkah again we&amp;#39;re going to see just</text>
  <text start="1396.63" dur="5.34">as the Pharisees filled with Satan were</text>
  <text start="1398.67" dur="4.89">trying to murder Yahshua so to as Satan</text>
  <text start="1401.97" dur="6.06">gets cats down in these coming months</text>
  <text start="1403.56" dur="6.27">leading up to March 11th 2014 which is</text>
  <text start="1408.03" dur="4.62">when the abomination of desolation does</text>
  <text start="1409.83" dur="5.07">occur that Satan is going to become</text>
  <text start="1412.65" dur="3.81">enraged she&amp;#39;s going to be wanting to</text>
  <text start="1414.9" dur="3.21">murder believers there&amp;#39;s give me a lot</text>
  <text start="1416.46" dur="3.75">of cast that goes on in fact even says</text>
  <text start="1418.11" dur="4.92">in Revelation 12 that is going to chase</text>
  <text start="1420.21" dur="4.56">after the woman that I believe is going</text>
  <text start="1423.03" dur="3.21">to happen between March 11th in April</text>
  <text start="1424.77" dur="3.66">10th is going to be chasing after women</text>
  <text start="1426.24" dur="4.17">trying to kill her of course Revelation</text>
  <text start="1428.43" dur="4.35">12 says the woman is able to escape into</text>
  <text start="1430.41" dur="5.1">the safe place for a period of 12</text>
  <text start="1432.78" dur="4.47">hundred and sixty days and then the</text>
  <text start="1435.51" dur="3.78">woman and then the dragon because he</text>
  <text start="1437.25" dur="3.9">can&amp;#39;t get the woman he then goes after</text>
  <text start="1439.29" dur="5.88">the remnant of her seed and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="1441.15" dur="5.58">we get the martyrs so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="1445.17" dur="5.16">a very similar type of parallel that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1446.73" dur="10.77">going on here inhale Yahshua celebrates</text>
  <text start="1450.33" dur="8.73">hanukkah now just because the Jews over</text>
  <text start="1457.5" dur="3.41">the last 2,000 years have added a lot of</text>
  <text start="1459.06" dur="4.14">sort of pagan twist to the celebration</text>
  <text start="1460.91" dur="4.72">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we shouldn&amp;#39;t keep it</text>
  <text start="1463.2" dur="4.29">because as I&amp;#39;ve demonstrated Yahshua</text>
  <text start="1465.63" dur="4.17">kept it there is a pure way to observe</text>
  <text start="1467.49" dur="4.35">it and it does have some key prophetic</text>
  <text start="1469.8" dur="3.63">insights in fact I believe there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1471.84" dur="4.41">to be another fulfillment of Hanukkah</text>
  <text start="1473.43" dur="4.88">when Yahshua returns that that&amp;#39;ll be the</text>
  <text start="1476.25" dur="4.61">time when he actually read dedicates</text>
  <text start="1478.31" dur="7.8">the Millennial temple the temple that we</text>
  <text start="1480.86" dur="8.79">read about from Ezekiel 4246 where</text>
  <text start="1486.11" dur="5.04">zekiel shown a vision of Israel fact I</text>
  <text start="1489.65" dur="5.19">was just reading his Eagle the other day</text>
  <text start="1491.15" dur="6.06">and there&amp;#39;s this vision where Yahweh</text>
  <text start="1494.84" dur="5.22">puts his eco on this high high high high</text>
  <text start="1497.21" dur="4.35">high mountain in Israel and it&amp;#39;s either</text>
  <text start="1500.06" dur="3.21">struck me well there are no high high</text>
  <text start="1501.56" dur="3.93">high mountains in Israel not right now</text>
  <text start="1503.27" dur="4.68">but remember there&amp;#39;s a prophecy where</text>
  <text start="1505.49" dur="3.96">the earth shakes right toward the end</text>
  <text start="1507.95" dur="2.97">the Great Tribulation and all the</text>
  <text start="1509.45" dur="3.81">mountains of the years sort of cave in</text>
  <text start="1510.92" dur="3.87">and then mount zion has made the highest</text>
  <text start="1513.26" dur="3.96">mountain of them all like taller than</text>
  <text start="1514.79" dur="4.44">Mount Everest and so I realized oh k is</text>
  <text start="1517.22" dur="3.48">equal seeing the future when Israel is</text>
  <text start="1519.23" dur="4.38">under yash from the Millennial Kingdom</text>
  <text start="1520.7" dur="5.28">and he sees this hihihi great mountain</text>
  <text start="1523.61" dur="4.35">he sees Jerusalem atop this mountain and</text>
  <text start="1525.98" dur="4.05">then he starts describing this temple</text>
  <text start="1527.96" dur="4.02">and so I believe yah she was going to</text>
  <text start="1530.03" dur="5.67">rededicate this temple in Hanukkah of</text>
  <text start="1531.98" dur="6.75">2017 so Hanukkah does have some very key</text>
  <text start="1535.7" dur="5.19">prophetic insights there are also a lot</text>
  <text start="1538.73" dur="3.45">of teachings that I have on my website</text>
  <text start="1540.89" dur="2.79">about Hanukkah effect they have a whole</text>
  <text start="1542.18" dur="4.7">section dedicated to Hanukkah at the</text>
  <text start="1543.68" dur="5.76">feast of dedication and and purity um</text>
  <text start="1546.88" dur="5.92">but I do think it&amp;#39;s a very important</text>
  <text start="1549.44" dur="5.01">piece to to observe so that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="1552.8" dur="3.9">much my teaching on a lot of comment I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1554.45" dur="5.85">going to keep the recording going to do</text>
  <text start="1556.7" dur="7.16">any questions and answers so I just I</text>
  <text start="1560.3" dur="6.48">just want to ask you to touch into the</text>
  <text start="1563.86" dur="5.08">clarification each one the third in the</text>
  <text start="1566.78" dur="6.66">seventh day because this ties in with</text>
  <text start="1568.94" dur="7.23">the timeline and yeah okay that is</text>
  <text start="1573.44" dur="4.94">numbers I&amp;#39;m trying to what chapter that</text>
  <text start="1576.17" dur="2.21">is</text>
  <text start="1580.55" dur="5.23">we can&amp;#39;t because it generally give it</text>
  <text start="1583.05" dur="4.2">yeah so there&amp;#39;s a passage I have a</text>
  <text start="1585.78" dur="2.88">podcast about this in fact I have a</text>
  <text start="1587.25" dur="3.45">couple pockets about this because i made</text>
  <text start="1588.66" dur="4.59">this impasse over n on Yom Kippur I</text>
  <text start="1590.7" dur="5.61">believe it&amp;#39;s in the book of numbers I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1593.25" dur="5.15">find it eventually but basically what it</text>
  <text start="1596.31" dur="6.75">is is there&amp;#39;s a commandment in the Torah</text>
  <text start="1598.4" dur="6.61">and when you touched a dead body what</text>
  <text start="1603.06" dur="3.72">happens is that you&amp;#39;re basically unclean</text>
  <text start="1605.01" dur="3.99">for seven days like you can&amp;#39;t get close</text>
  <text start="1606.78" dur="4.14">to the temple and so what they would do</text>
  <text start="1609" dur="4.29">is they would get the ashes of a red</text>
  <text start="1610.92" dur="4.17">heifer okay sacrifices read ever get the</text>
  <text start="1613.29" dur="4.89">Ashford red heifer mix it in water</text>
  <text start="1615.09" dur="5.79">formed basically line and you would have</text>
  <text start="1618.18" dur="5.07">to wash yourself on the third day of</text>
  <text start="1620.88" dur="4.41">your uncleanness okay and then by the</text>
  <text start="1623.25" dur="3.99">seventh day you did another washing and</text>
  <text start="1625.29" dur="4.74">you were fully cleaned however there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1627.24" dur="4.47">very big warning in the Senate said if</text>
  <text start="1630.03" dur="4.29">you do not get cleanse on the third day</text>
  <text start="1631.71" dur="3.63">of the seventh and cleanness doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1634.32" dur="3.27">matter what you do on the seventh day</text>
  <text start="1635.34" dur="4.5">you&amp;#39;re not going to be clean okay and</text>
  <text start="1637.59" dur="3.84">and it&amp;#39;s all in the scripture so you</text>
  <text start="1639.84" dur="3.89">have to be you have to cleanse yourself</text>
  <text start="1641.43" dur="4.98">the third day of the seventh day well</text>
  <text start="1643.73" dur="5.05">when I read this I realized that with</text>
  <text start="1646.41" dur="7.83">the seven last years of Daniels 70th</text>
  <text start="1648.78" dur="7.47">week being from 2010 2017 that 2013 is</text>
  <text start="1654.24" dur="4.92">the third day and yah just like a</text>
  <text start="1656.25" dur="4.56">clearing and Bell spoke very loudly to</text>
  <text start="1659.16" dur="4.11">me as I was meditating on that tour bus</text>
  <text start="1660.81" dur="4.68">and said Daniel you need to tell the</text>
  <text start="1663.27" dur="4.05">people they&amp;#39;ve got to be clean they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1665.49" dur="4.89">got to be clean and pressing into me</text>
  <text start="1667.32" dur="4.95">before the end of 2013 because they</text>
  <text start="1670.38" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re going to be in a world of</text>
  <text start="1672.27" dur="6.96">hurt until 2017 and in fact many of them</text>
  <text start="1676.02" dur="4.35">won&amp;#39;t make it they won&amp;#39;t make it 2017 or</text>
  <text start="1679.23" dur="2.82">if they do they&amp;#39;re going to have to go</text>
  <text start="1680.37" dur="3.72">through the purification of being a</text>
  <text start="1682.05" dur="3.93">martyr or they may not even make it to</text>
  <text start="1684.09" dur="3.72">the first resurrection period so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1685.98" dur="3.69">very very important that those who want</text>

  <text start="1802.5" dur="3.51">some really important information in</text>
  <text start="1804.33" dur="5.88">those videos and I believe that it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1806.01" dur="5.789">scriptural but basically since you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1810.21" dur="4.05">sort of don&amp;#39;t know what what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1811.799" dur="4.681">here with those videos and explains a</text>
  <text start="1814.26" dur="4.14">lot of that there&amp;#39;s three harvests in</text>
  <text start="1816.48" dur="4.41">Israel there&amp;#39;s the barley harvest in the</text>
  <text start="1818.4" dur="4.56">early spring there&amp;#39;s the wheat harvest</text>
  <text start="1820.89" dur="5.46">in the in the summer early summer time</text>
  <text start="1822.96" dur="5.14">and then there&amp;#39;s the fall in the fruit</text>
  <text start="1826.35" dur="3.61">harvest in the fall okay</text>
  <text start="1828.1" dur="5.1">and I believe that those three harvests</text>
  <text start="1829.96" dur="4.709">represent the 144,000 and the woman that</text>
  <text start="1833.2" dur="4.05">go to the safe place there&amp;#39;s a barley</text>
  <text start="1834.669" dur="5.161">there&amp;#39;s the martyrs who are the wheat</text>
  <text start="1837.25" dur="4.2">and then the fall fruits is basically</text>
  <text start="1839.83" dur="2.76">all of us getting resurrected at the end</text>
  <text start="1841.45" dur="3.69">of the tribulation and what the</text>
  <text start="1842.59" dur="6.3">Christians call the rapture and is that</text>
  <text start="1845.14" dur="7.44">what I believe is that you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1848.89" dur="5.25">seven congregations in Revelation only</text>
  <text start="1852.58" dur="3.36">one of them only one of them</text>
  <text start="1854.14" dur="3.419">Philadelphia is the one that gets to</text>
  <text start="1855.94" dur="3.72">escape all these things that come a pass</text>
  <text start="1857.559" dur="3.721">I don&amp;#39;t believe in a pre-tribulation</text>
  <text start="1859.66" dur="2.73">rapture I don&amp;#39;t think we just wrap</text>
  <text start="1861.28" dur="3.75">out of here and we don&amp;#39;t have been I</text>
  <text start="1862.39" dur="4.529">believe we&amp;#39;re here but there is a way</text>
  <text start="1865.03" dur="3.029">and yash himself said pray that your</text>
  <text start="1866.919" dur="3.451">account where you escape all these</text>
  <text start="1868.059" dur="4.381">things and then Philadelphia says</text>
  <text start="1870.37" dur="4.5">because you learn the word of my</text>
  <text start="1872.44" dur="4.859">patients you adored me and you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1874.87" dur="4.02">denied my name I&amp;#39;m gonna let you escape</text>
  <text start="1877.299" dur="4.26">from this our butts come upon the whole</text>
  <text start="1878.89" dur="4.94">to try them so I believe the</text>
  <text start="1881.559" dur="4.681">Philadelphian believers if you will the</text>
  <text start="1883.83" dur="4.39">144,000 along with the woman the bride I</text>
  <text start="1886.24" dur="4.65">believe that they are going to be sealed</text>
  <text start="1888.22" dur="6.93">and protected and basically allowed to</text>
  <text start="1890.89" dur="6.12">get to to get to the safe place and that</text>
  <text start="1895.15" dur="4.23">this is going to happen in this in the</text>
  <text start="1897.01" dur="4.89">early spring in the time of the barley</text>
  <text start="1899.38" dur="5.07">harvest in the days leading up to April</text>
  <text start="1901.9" dur="5.55">10th because that&amp;#39;s 1260 days until</text>
  <text start="1904.45" dur="4.77">piece of trumpets 2017 so I believe</text>
  <text start="1907.45" dur="3.24">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the barley that of course</text>
  <text start="1909.22" dur="2.67">is the group I want to be in and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1910.69" dur="2.79">the group that i&amp;#39;m encouraging all</text>
  <text start="1911.89" dur="3.81">people who watch my youtube&amp;#39;s and go to</text>
  <text start="1913.48" dur="4.29">my website to be in to be the part of</text>
  <text start="1915.7" dur="3.39">that philadelphia and to pray for that</text>
  <text start="1917.77" dur="6.12">so that you&amp;#39;re a kind of worthy to do</text>
  <text start="1919.09" dur="6.51">that then the next was the wheat and of</text>
  <text start="1923.89" dur="3.69">course the summertime was always been</text>
  <text start="1925.6" dur="3.569">Israel the time of persecution because</text>
  <text start="1927.58" dur="3.57">that was the month of off that was the</text>
  <text start="1929.169" dur="4.471">month a month of always happens in the</text>
  <text start="1931.15" dur="3.87">summer and that was the month of the</text>
  <text start="1933.64" dur="2.669">temple was destroyed by King</text>
  <text start="1935.02" dur="3.48">Nebuchadnezzar and it&amp;#39;s always been the</text>
  <text start="1936.309" dur="3.691">time of persecution for the Jews so the</text>
  <text start="1938.5" dur="3.36">weed is like the martyrs these are the</text>
  <text start="1940" dur="3.84">people who didn&amp;#39;t didn&amp;#39;t press in to</text>
  <text start="1941.86" dur="3.27">become Philadelphia maybe they&amp;#39;re part</text>
  <text start="1943.84" dur="3">of the other sis congregations and</text>
  <text start="1945.13" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re the render the woman seen in</text>
  <text start="1946.84" dur="3.69">there they didn&amp;#39;t they didn&amp;#39;t get to the</text>
  <text start="1948.64" dur="3.39">safe place but now they&amp;#39;re confronted</text>
  <text start="1950.53" dur="2.279">with this beastly kingdom that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1952.03" dur="2.85">in and they&amp;#39;re gonna have to make a</text>
  <text start="1952.809" dur="4.35">choice between the mark of the beast and</text>
  <text start="1954.88" dur="3.63">martyrdom and it is through martyrdom</text>
  <text start="1957.159" dur="2.561">that they&amp;#39;re going to be refined and</text>
  <text start="1958.51" dur="2.86">purified and</text>
  <text start="1959.72" dur="4.199">blessed are they who died an aside from</text>
  <text start="1961.37" dur="4.11">this day on average revelation says and</text>
  <text start="1963.919" dur="3.931">that those martyrs are going to</text>
  <text start="1965.48" dur="4.26">basically be slaughtered between 2014</text>
  <text start="1967.85" dur="4.86">and 2017 three and a half year period</text>
  <text start="1969.74" dur="5.37">and then of course the fall fruits is</text>
  <text start="1972.71" dur="3.81">basically on the resurrection yom teruah</text>
  <text start="1975.11" dur="3.75">at the very day that the two witnesses</text>
  <text start="1976.52" dur="4.17">are resurrected which is the very day</text>
  <text start="1978.86" dur="4.049">all the dead of Messiah are resurrected</text>

  <text start="1987.62" dur="3.9">next three and a half years are</text>
  <text start="1989.63" dur="4.11">resurrected and then we went we who are</text>
  <text start="1991.52" dur="4.05">alive and remain which I believe at that</text>
