  <text start="6.859" dur="6.131">februari 8 2014 and now we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="10.019" dur="5.12">continue on with Hebrews chapter 7 so</text>
  <text start="12.99" dur="4.2">Hebrews 6 sort of transitioned us into</text>
  <text start="15.139" dur="3.911">starting to talk about the order of</text>
  <text start="17.19" dur="3.509">mikkel tzedek as opposed to the</text>
  <text start="19.05" dur="3.979">Levitical priesthood and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="20.699" dur="4.801">continue to explore that now in Hebrew 7</text>
  <text start="23.029" dur="4.24">of course we know that McKell Zadok was</text>
  <text start="25.5" dur="3.81">the King of Jerusalem was the king of</text>
  <text start="27.269" dur="5.731">Salem that Abraham paid ties to way back</text>
  <text start="29.31" dur="6.78">in Genesis I believe that this King was</text>
  <text start="33" dur="8.07">Shem the son of Noah that&amp;#39;s who i</text>
  <text start="36.09" dur="8.039">believe it&amp;#39;s referring to for this makel</text>
  <text start="41.07" dur="5.64">Zadok king of Salem which was the name</text>
  <text start="44.129" dur="5.641">of Jerusalem before it became Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="46.71" dur="5.07">priest of the Most High yah who met</text>
  <text start="49.77" dur="6.719">Abraham returning from the slaughter of</text>
  <text start="51.78" dur="6.09">the Kings and blessed him that&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="4.8">of the kings of course is referring to</text>
  <text start="57.87" dur="6.359">when Abraham slaughtered the five kings</text>
  <text start="61.289" dur="4.461">that had taken lot his nephew hostage</text>
  <text start="64.229" dur="4.411">and Abraham went after them and</text>
  <text start="65.75" dur="6.939">slaughtered them and rescued his nephew</text>
  <text start="68.64" dur="7.11">and his family to him also Abraham gave</text>
  <text start="72.689" dur="5.371">a tenth part of all first being by</text>
  <text start="75.75" dur="4.77">interpretation king of righteousness and</text>
  <text start="78.06" dur="5.669">after that also king of Salem witch is</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="5.76">king of peace without father without</text>
  <text start="83.729" dur="4.89">mother without dissent having neither</text>
  <text start="86.28" dur="6.42">beginning of days nor end of life but</text>
  <text start="88.619" dur="6.901">made like unto the Son of yah abides a</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="6.989">priest continually oh the key phrase</text>
  <text start="95.52" dur="5.94">here in verse 3 is made like unto okay</text>
  <text start="99.689" dur="5.04">that means that it wasn&amp;#39;t literally</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="5.43">Yahshua appearing to Abraham it was just</text>
  <text start="104.729" dur="3.511">that Shem was a type in shadow the</text>
  <text start="106.89" dur="6.81">kingdom of kells like was a type and</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="6.96">shadow pointing toward Yahshua and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.7" dur="2.94">going to create this beautiful picture</text>
  <text start="115.2" dur="4.379">that that the author is now going to go</text>
  <text start="116.64" dur="4.95">into in Hebrew 7 now consider how great</text>
  <text start="119.579" dur="4.741">this man was unto whom even the</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="6.029">patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="5.88">spoils and verily they that are of the</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="4.59">sons of Levi who received the office of</text>
  <text start="130.2" dur="3.45">the priesthood have a commandment to</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="3.571">take ties of the people</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="4.649">according to the Torah that is of their</text>
  <text start="135.78" dur="5.4">brethren though they come out of the</text>
  <text start="138.299" dur="4.5">loins of Abraham okay this is referring</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="3.54">to when the people would pay their ties</text>
  <text start="142.799" dur="3.151">to the Levitical priests the little</text>
  <text start="144.72" dur="3.659">caprice would then have a heave offering</text>
  <text start="145.95" dur="3.539">so they would then take ten percent of</text>
  <text start="148.379" dur="6.56">whatever they received of their</text>
  <text start="149.489" dur="8.28">offerings and give it to yah okay but</text>
  <text start="154.939" dur="5.86">we&amp;#39;re realizing that Abraham who was the</text>
  <text start="157.769" dur="6.541">father of the Levites he paid his tithe</text>
  <text start="160.799" dur="5.371">also to somebody else and this is too</text>
  <text start="164.31" dur="7.679">Shem who was a type and shadow of</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="7.98">Yahshua verse 6 but he whose descent is</text>
  <text start="171.989" dur="5.37">not counted from them received tithes of</text>
  <text start="174.15" dur="5.82">Abraham and blessed him that had the</text>
  <text start="177.359" dur="5.97">promises and without all current all</text>
  <text start="179.97" dur="10.62">contradiction the less is blessed of the</text>
  <text start="183.329" dur="10.231">better okay so Abraham paved his ties to</text>
  <text start="190.59" dur="4.319">mikal&amp;#39;s a deck which basically means the</text>
  <text start="193.56" dur="3.66">Levitical priesthood that came from</text>
  <text start="194.909" dur="4.98">Abraham&amp;#39;s loins also paid their ties to</text>
  <text start="197.22" dur="3.9">mikal&amp;#39;s a deck McHale Vedek in the story</text>
  <text start="199.889" dur="3.541">if you go back to Genesis he then</text>
  <text start="201.12" dur="5.04">blessed his Abraham for the ties that</text>
  <text start="203.43" dur="4.529">he&amp;#39;s given and this is why the less is</text>
  <text start="206.16" dur="7.38">blessed of the better Abraham gets</text>
  <text start="207.959" dur="7.53">blessed by mikkel Zadok and here men</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="4.199">verse 8 in here men that died received</text>
  <text start="215.489" dur="5.34">tithes but there he receives them of</text>
  <text start="217.739" dur="5.67">whom it is written that he lives and as</text>
  <text start="220.829" dur="6.87">I may also say Levi also who received</text>
  <text start="223.409" dur="6.211">ties paid ties in Abraham because</text>
  <text start="227.699" dur="3.9">Abraham and not because Levi had not</text>
  <text start="229.62" dur="4.259">been born yet nor Levitical priests had</text>
  <text start="231.599" dur="3.901">been established yet they were still in</text>
  <text start="233.879" dur="4.44">the loins of Abraham but through Abraham</text>
  <text start="235.5" dur="5.37">paying his ties to this to Shem this</text>
  <text start="238.319" dur="6.121">miquel Tzadik priest they paid their</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="6.199">ties to him for he was yet in the loins</text>
  <text start="244.44" dur="5.25">of his father when mikkel Zadok met him</text>
  <text start="247.069" dur="4.271">if there for perfection revived</text>
  <text start="249.69" dur="3.93">Levitical priesthood for under it the</text>
  <text start="251.34" dur="3.959">people received the Torah what further</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="3.149">need was there that another priest</text>
  <text start="255.299" dur="3.69">should arise after the order of</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="5.64">michelle&amp;#39;s neck and not be called after</text>
  <text start="258.989" dur="5.971">the order of aerome for the priesthood</text>
  <text start="262.409" dur="3.361">being changed there is made of necessity</text>
  <text start="264.96" dur="3.78">it chains</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="4.829">also of the Torah for he of whom these</text>
  <text start="268.74" dur="4.679">things are spoken pertains to another</text>
  <text start="270.599" dur="5.04">tribe of which no man gave attendance at</text>
  <text start="273.419" dur="5.22">the altar what is evident that our Lord</text>
  <text start="275.639" dur="6.81">spring out of Judah of which tribe Moses</text>
  <text start="278.639" dur="7.71">spake nothing concerning the priesthood</text>
  <text start="282.449" dur="5.761">okay so let&amp;#39;s start stopping verse 14 so</text>
  <text start="286.349" dur="5.16">what is the change that is made the</text>
  <text start="288.21" dur="5.549">changes made that from this you know for</text>
  <text start="291.509" dur="5.581">thousands of years the only way a priest</text>
  <text start="293.759" dur="4.951">could could come as from the tribe of</text>
  <text start="297.09" dur="4.949">Levi they had to come from the tribe of</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="5.16">Levi but now we see the reason why a</text>
  <text start="302.039" dur="4.741">priest could now come from another tribe</text>
  <text start="303.87" dur="4.859">the tribe of Judah because you take the</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="4.35">entire Levitical priesthood which is in</text>
  <text start="308.729" dur="6.09">the lines of Abraham and they paid their</text>
  <text start="311.13" dur="6.599">ties to this King this makel zanette</text>
  <text start="314.819" dur="7.081">king of salem who was a type in shadow</text>
  <text start="317.729" dur="6.84">of Yahshua so there is a pure Easter</text>
  <text start="321.9" dur="4.59">that was established even before before</text>
  <text start="324.569" dur="4.35">the Levitical priesthood this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="326.49" dur="4.019">nullify the Levitical priesthood it</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="4.8">doesn&amp;#39;t say the Levitical priesthood is</text>
  <text start="330.509" dur="5.25">no good it&amp;#39;s simply just saying that the</text>
  <text start="333.719" dur="4.561">Mikasa decreased it from which Yahshua</text>
  <text start="335.759" dur="4.741">comes is a higher priesthood is a</text>
  <text start="338.28" dur="7.05">superior priesthood to have the little</text>
  <text start="340.5" dur="6.539">priesthood and why do I say that this</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="6.17">doesn&amp;#39;t nullify Levitical priesthood</text>
  <text start="347.039" dur="9.361">because if we go to Malachi chapter 3</text>
  <text start="351.5" dur="8.229">which is talking about the future still</text>
  <text start="356.4" dur="5.48">our future Valek I 3 verse 1 it says</text>
  <text start="359.729" dur="4.59">behold I will send my messenger and he</text>
  <text start="361.88" dur="4.659">shall prepare the way before me and</text>
  <text start="364.319" dur="4.981">Yahweh whom you seek shall suddenly come</text>
  <text start="366.539" dur="4.711">to his temple even the messenger of the</text>
  <text start="369.3" dur="4.5">Covenant whom you delight in behold he</text>
  <text start="371.25" dur="5.4">shall come saith Yahweh of hosts but who</text>
  <text start="373.8" dur="4.5">may abide the day of his coming and who</text>
  <text start="376.65" dur="3.569">shall stand when he appears for he is</text>
  <text start="378.3" dur="4.5">like a refiners fire and like folder</text>
  <text start="380.219" dur="5.551">soap and he shall sit as a refiner and</text>
  <text start="382.8" dur="6.149">purifier of silver and he shall purify</text>
  <text start="385.77" dur="5.19">the sons of Levi and purge them as gold</text>
  <text start="388.949" dur="4.861">and silver that they may offer unto</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="4.819">yahweh an offering in righteousness then</text>
  <text start="393.81" dur="5.609">shall the offering of Judah and</text>
  <text start="395.779" dur="5.741">Jerusalem be pleasant unto yahweh as in</text>
  <text start="399.419" dur="4.411">the days of old and as in former years</text>
  <text start="401.52" dur="4.85">this is obviously talking not about his</text>
  <text start="403.83" dur="5.009">first coming but his second coming and</text>
  <text start="406.37" dur="6.579">it says he&amp;#39;s going to purge the sons of</text>
  <text start="408.839" dur="5.971">Levi and reinstate their priesthood to</text>
  <text start="412.949" dur="4.051">offer sacrifices so that it went once</text>
  <text start="414.81" dur="3.87">again will be righteous and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="417" dur="5.37">instrument it&amp;#39;s interesting that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="418.68" dur="5.31">from the from the line of mikela deck</text>
  <text start="422.37" dur="3.84">from the Mykelti priesthood he is the</text>
  <text start="423.99" dur="4.289">one that has to purify and restore</text>
  <text start="426.21" dur="4.319">Levitical priesthood why because just as</text>
  <text start="428.279" dur="4.17">we read in Hebrews and as we see in</text>
  <text start="430.529" dur="11.07">Genesis mikal&amp;#39;s a deck is of a higher</text>
  <text start="432.449" dur="12.621">more superior priesthood than Levi ok</text>
  <text start="441.599" dur="3.471">back to Hebrews chapter 7</text>
  <text start="446.51" dur="3.45">so that is the only thing that&amp;#39;s changed</text>
  <text start="447.95" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s the only thing that&amp;#39;s changed in</text>
  <text start="449.96" dur="5.19">the Torah is that a priest can now come</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="4.92">from outside of Levi witches from Judah</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s where Yahshua came from and the</text>
  <text start="457.16" dur="4.35">reason being was already embedded in the</text>
  <text start="459.44" dur="4.29">Torah in the book of Genesis because</text>
  <text start="461.51" dur="4.92">Abraham paid ties to someone who was</text>
  <text start="463.73" dur="5.04">greater than him and this was a type and</text>
  <text start="466.43" dur="4.7">picture of Yahshua the Messiah Shem</text>
  <text start="468.77" dur="6.27">being of the mikkel zydeco priesthood</text>
  <text start="471.13" dur="6.76">verse 15 and it is yet far more evident</text>
  <text start="475.04" dur="4.8">that after the simul tude of mchale</text>
  <text start="477.89" dur="3.63">tzadik there rises another priest after</text>
  <text start="479.84" dur="3.93">the simul tooth so again we have another</text>
  <text start="481.52" dur="5.01">keyword here that shows that it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="483.77" dur="5.01">that Yasha was literally the priest that</text>
  <text start="486.53" dur="4.86">Abraham was paying tithes to but it was</text>
  <text start="488.78" dur="6.36">a symbol to it was like unto Shem was a</text>
  <text start="491.39" dur="5.67">shadow picture of what Yahshua pointing</text>
  <text start="495.14" dur="6.63">toward Yahshua from a higher priest</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="7.56">priesthood who is made not after the</text>
  <text start="501.77" dur="7.05">Torah of a colonel commandant but after</text>
  <text start="504.62" dur="6.83">the power of an endless life for he</text>
  <text start="508.82" dur="5.67">testifies you are a priest forever after</text>
  <text start="511.45" dur="5.5">the order of mikkel Zadok this is</text>
  <text start="514.49" dur="3.9">talking about Yahshua for there is</text>
  <text start="516.95" dur="3.21">rarely a dissing alling of the</text>
  <text start="518.39" dur="4.67">commandment going before for the</text>
  <text start="520.16" dur="6.27">weakness and unprofitable pneus thereof</text>
  <text start="523.06" dur="5.77">for the Torah made nothing perfect but</text>
  <text start="526.43" dur="5.16">the bringing in of a better hope did by</text>
  <text start="528.83" dur="6.18">the which we draw nigh unto yah remember</text>
  <text start="531.59" dur="5.16">the Torah and it&amp;#39;s easy furring to the</text>
  <text start="535.01" dur="4.17">particular part of the Torah involving</text>
  <text start="536.75" dur="4.17">the animal sacrifices and the</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="4.64">institution of the Levitical priesthood</text>
  <text start="540.92" dur="6.45">that part of toilet was never designed</text>
  <text start="543.82" dur="5.29">to make anyone perfect it was always</text>
  <text start="547.37" dur="6.33">designed to point toward something</text>
  <text start="549.11" dur="6.27">better this is why Joshua says that you</text>
  <text start="553.7" dur="3.24">know it&amp;#39;s easier for heaven earth to</text>
  <text start="555.38" dur="3.87">pass away then for one stroke of the</text>
  <text start="556.94" dur="4.74">Torah but the one part of the tour that</text>
  <text start="559.25" dur="4.59">will pass away eventually when we get to</text>
  <text start="561.68" dur="4.5">the new heavens and new earth is all the</text>
  <text start="563.84" dur="5.34">ordinances involving animal sacrifices</text>
  <text start="566.18" dur="4.59">and Levitical priesthood that will all</text>
  <text start="569.18" dur="3.39">pass away because eventually we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="570.77" dur="3.33">to get to a point after the Millennial</text>
  <text start="572.57" dur="3.3">Kingdom where there will be no more</text>
  <text start="574.1" dur="4.2">animal sacrifices there will be no more</text>
  <text start="575.87" dur="4.23">death period and there will be no temple</text>
  <text start="578.3" dur="3.42">because Yahshua himself</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="3.919">the order of mikkel so that will be the</text>
  <text start="581.72" dur="4.979">temple of the new heavens and new earth</text>
  <text start="584.019" dur="6.841">so that is one part of the Torah that</text>
  <text start="586.699" dur="6.39">will pass away and we see why right here</text>
  <text start="590.86" dur="4.149">because that part of the Torah was never</text>
  <text start="593.089" dur="3.451">designed to last forever it was carnal</text>
  <text start="595.009" dur="7.5">it was meant to have an end</text>
  <text start="596.54" dur="8.01">determination eventually its</text>
  <text start="602.509" dur="3.81">unprofitable because it&amp;#39;s only designed</text>
  <text start="604.55" dur="3.659">to point toward Yahshua it was never</text>
  <text start="606.319" dur="7.25">designed in and of itself to cause</text>
  <text start="608.209" dur="5.36">Redemption that&amp;#39;s where Yahshua comes in</text>
  <text start="613.99" dur="4.69">so verse 19 for the law again made</text>
  <text start="616.94" dur="4.379">nothing perfect but the bringing of a</text>
  <text start="618.68" dur="5.909">better hope did by the which we draw 92</text>
  <text start="621.319" dur="4.621">yacht and we also know this because the</text>
  <text start="624.589" dur="3.3">blood of bulls and goats was</text>
  <text start="625.94" dur="3.54">insufficient to purge our conscience but</text>
  <text start="627.889" dur="4.081">the blood of Yahshua is sufficient</text>
  <text start="629.48" dur="6.57">sufficient to cleanse us of our past sin</text>
  <text start="631.97" dur="8.64">and to help us to live lives of victory</text>
  <text start="636.05" dur="6.089">over soon see the problem that happens</text>
  <text start="640.61" dur="3.93">here as Christians want to take these</text>
  <text start="642.139" dur="4.351">verses sale look look the Torah is</text>
  <text start="644.54" dur="3.539">carnal it&amp;#39;s been done away with and we</text>

  <text start="661.97" dur="6.869">done away with eventually after the</text>

  <text start="671.149" dur="4.92">a priest for those priests were made</text>
  <text start="673.85" dur="4.65">without an oath but this with an oath by</text>

  <text start="678.5" dur="4.62">will not repent thou art a priest</text>
  <text start="680.18" dur="6.329">forever after the order of mikkel Zadok</text>
  <text start="683.12" dur="7.019">by so much was yoshua made a surety of a</text>
  <text start="686.509" dur="6.301">better testament so this is saying that</text>
  <text start="690.139" dur="4.89">yah swore an oath and said i&amp;#39;m going to</text>

  <text start="700.1" dur="3.719">priesthood was not put in by an oath the</text>
  <text start="702.259" dur="5.31">Levitical priesthood was instituted</text>
  <text start="703.819" dur="5.58">again by put into effect by the angels</text>
  <text start="707.569" dur="2.531">and it was a tour that was given to</text>
  <text start="709.399" dur="2.74">Moses and that</text>
  <text start="710.1" dur="3.87">tickle apart again was simply to point</text>
  <text start="712.139" dur="5.43">toward what Yasha was going to do and</text>
  <text start="713.97" dur="5.179">fulfill verse 23 and they truly were</text>
  <text start="717.569" dur="4.051">many priests because they were not</text>
  <text start="719.149" dur="4.571">suffered to continue by reason of death</text>
  <text start="721.62" dur="3.87">in other words all of these priests</text>
  <text start="723.72" dur="3.63">these high priests up until the writing</text>
  <text start="725.49" dur="6.24">of Hebrews these high priests were all</text>
  <text start="727.35" dur="6.27">men subject to dying to death and so</text>
  <text start="731.73" dur="3.359">that&amp;#39;s why they had to have many many</text>
  <text start="733.62" dur="2.459">many priests because once one priest</text>
  <text start="735.089" dur="2.131">would die they&amp;#39;d have to bring up</text>
  <text start="736.079" dur="2.221">another high priests and once that high</text>
  <text start="737.22" dur="3.57">priesthood I&amp;#39;d have to bring up another</text>
  <text start="738.3" dur="4.92">high priest but this man because he</text>
  <text start="740.79" dur="4.83">continues forever has an unchangeable</text>
  <text start="743.22" dur="3.869">priesthood so yeah sure he broke the</text>
  <text start="745.62" dur="5.219">cycle of death he was the first high</text>
  <text start="747.089" dur="5.701">priest that came forth that that when he</text>
  <text start="750.839" dur="3.99">died he rose again three days and three</text>
  <text start="752.79" dur="4.56">nights later so you don&amp;#39;t need a bunch</text>
  <text start="754.829" dur="7.021">of priests now you just have one because</text>
  <text start="757.35" dur="7.32">he conquered death hallelujah verse 25</text>
  <text start="761.85" dur="5.219">wherefore he is able also to save them</text>
  <text start="764.67" dur="4.2">to the uttermost that come of the by him</text>
  <text start="767.069" dur="3.601">seeing he ever lives to make</text>
  <text start="768.87" dur="3.3">intercession for them so this is so</text>
  <text start="770.67" dur="4.05">beautiful because this is now coming</text>
  <text start="772.17" dur="5.49">back to Hebrews 1 Hebrews 2 and Hebrews</text>
  <text start="774.72" dur="5.28">3 where we talked about the main primary</text>
  <text start="777.66" dur="5.7">reason of Yahshua coming into the flesh</text>
  <text start="780" dur="7.829">and giving up all of his his his power</text>
  <text start="783.36" dur="5.789">as Yahweh Almighty is he came so that he</text>
  <text start="787.829" dur="3.031">could you know he went through all that</text>
  <text start="789.149" dur="4.351">that we go through and yet he never</text>
  <text start="790.86" dur="4.68">sinned and he was touched with all our</text>
  <text start="793.5" dur="5.55">infirmities all our temptations all our</text>
  <text start="795.54" dur="6">frailties he had only access to that</text>
  <text start="799.05" dur="5.399">which we have access to and yet he never</text>
  <text start="801.54" dur="4.56">once Cindy always always always from</text>
  <text start="804.449" dur="4.801">from a little child all the way until</text>
  <text start="806.1" dur="6.15">the day of his resurrection he always</text>
  <text start="809.25" dur="5.339">placed his faith in ya in the father so</text>
  <text start="812.25" dur="4.589">he is qualified now to make intercession</text>
  <text start="814.589" dur="4.711">for us and help us to get to that same</text>
  <text start="816.839" dur="5.791">state where we can live holy and without</text>
  <text start="819.3" dur="4.83">sin by relying on his spirit and asking</text>
  <text start="822.63" dur="3.54">for a spirit and crying out from the</text>
  <text start="824.13" dur="5.1">depths of our heart yah abba father help</text>
  <text start="826.17" dur="4.62">us by your spirit to resist all sin so</text>
  <text start="829.23" dur="3.63">he&amp;#39;s able to save us uttermost which of</text>
  <text start="830.79" dur="4.08">course the high priests and Levitical</text>
  <text start="832.86" dur="4.74">priests could not do they could offer</text>
  <text start="834.87" dur="5.219">sacrifices that would point toward what</text>
  <text start="837.6" dur="4.469">eventually would happen through Yahshua</text>
  <text start="840.089" dur="2.44">but they could not they could not enter</text>
  <text start="842.069" dur="3.25">see</text>
  <text start="842.529" dur="6.961">need for us like Joshua can intercede</text>
  <text start="845.319" dur="7.56">for us for such an High Priest became us</text>
  <text start="849.49" dur="5.31">who is holy harmless undefiled separate</text>
  <text start="852.879" dur="3.69">from sinners and made higher than the</text>
  <text start="854.8" dur="5.61">heavens look at that it&amp;#39;s so beautiful</text>
  <text start="856.569" dur="5.52">he became us he became human okay in</text>
  <text start="860.41" dur="3.929">other words he he had a corruptible body</text>
  <text start="862.089" dur="4.321">he was touched with all our infirmities</text>
  <text start="864.339" dur="4.47">he was given all of the temptations we</text>
  <text start="866.41" dur="5.219">go through he became us and yet how is</text>
  <text start="868.809" dur="5.161">he different from us he was holy he was</text>
  <text start="871.629" dur="4.14">harmless he was undefiled he was</text>
  <text start="873.97" dur="3.51">separate from sinners and he was made</text>
  <text start="875.769" dur="6.031">higher than the heavens he never once</text>
  <text start="877.48" dur="9.539">ever succumbed to sin so he bridged the</text>
  <text start="881.8" dur="9.269">way back he became like Adam except an</text>
  <text start="887.019" dur="6.69">adam who never sinned hallelujah and so</text>
  <text start="891.069" dur="5.43">he was made higher than the heavens who</text>
  <text start="893.709" dur="5.521">needs not daily as those high priests to</text>
  <text start="896.499" dur="4.65">offer up sacrifice first for his own</text>
  <text start="899.23" dur="3.89">sins and then for the people&amp;#39;s for this</text>
  <text start="901.149" dur="4.35">he did once when he offered up himself</text>
  <text start="903.12" dur="4.6">the priests every year on Yom Kippur</text>
  <text start="905.499" dur="4.681">would have to go in and offer first the</text>
  <text start="907.72" dur="4.4">the sacrifice for his own sins and then</text>
  <text start="910.18" dur="3.87">the sacrifice for the people&amp;#39;s sins and</text>
  <text start="912.12" dur="3.43">of course then that high priest</text>
  <text start="914.05" dur="2.61">eventually after so many years would die</text>
  <text start="915.55" dur="2.67">and so and then another high priest</text>
  <text start="916.66" dur="4.679">roughly the same thing but this high</text>
  <text start="918.22" dur="5.07">priest Yahshua he he only had to do it</text>
  <text start="921.339" dur="5.161">once you only had to do it once way back</text>
  <text start="923.29" dur="6.599">in 1780 when he was crucified to the</text>
  <text start="926.5" dur="5.339">tree on the Mount of Olives in the place</text>
  <text start="929.889" dur="4.771">of the skulls he only had to do it once</text>
  <text start="931.839" dur="5.67">he only had to offer himself up for the</text>
  <text start="934.66" dur="6.09">people he offered up himself taking on</text>
  <text start="937.509" dur="5.13">all the sin upon himself for the Torah</text>
  <text start="940.75" dur="3.809">makes men high priests which have</text>
  <text start="942.639" dur="4.591">infirmity but the word of the oath which</text>
  <text start="944.559" dur="7.491">was since the law makes the son who is</text>
  <text start="947.23" dur="7.68">consecrated forevermore so this oath</text>
  <text start="952.05" dur="4.3">that was both established before because</text>
  <text start="954.91" dur="5.489">we have the order of mikela deck before</text>
  <text start="956.35" dur="6.209">Abraham ever gave ever gave birth to his</text>
  <text start="960.399" dur="4.651">grandson Levi and who then became the</text>
  <text start="962.559" dur="4.38">Levitical priesthood and is established</text>
  <text start="965.05" dur="3.779">again because Yahweh promised he was</text>
  <text start="966.939" dur="4.171">going to swear by he said he looked but</text>
  <text start="968.829" dur="3.63">this is an Isaiah I forget which passage</text>
  <text start="971.11" dur="4.829">but he basically says he looks shiny</text>
  <text start="972.459" dur="5.82">says is there not any one to go to</text>
  <text start="975.939" dur="4.11">to offer themselves as an intercession</text>
  <text start="978.279" dur="3.54">from people no one and so he says I will</text>
  <text start="980.049" dur="4.98">raise up my own right hand and I will do</text>
  <text start="981.819" dur="6.29">it I will do it I will offer myself and</text>
  <text start="985.029" dur="6.72">so he offered himself with an oath</text>
  <text start="988.109" dur="7.03">hallelujah he made himself the son who</text>
  <text start="991.749" dur="5.94">is consecrated forevermore so it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="995.139" dur="6.84">beautiful picture showing again how</text>
  <text start="997.689" dur="6.23">Yahshua was the way that Yahweh chose to</text>
  <text start="1001.979" dur="6.21">bridge the gap between his holy</text>
  <text start="1003.919" dur="6.85">undefiled glory and mankind bridging it</text>
  <text start="1008.189" dur="9.2">back to the way it used to be before</text>
  <text start="1010.769" dur="9.03">Satan tempted men to fall into sin and</text>
  <text start="1017.389" dur="4.54">this is this is how he accomplished that</text>
  <text start="1019.799" dur="5.191">so the important thing again to remember</text>
  <text start="1021.929" dur="4.86">from Hebrews 7 is that in no way is</text>
  <text start="1024.99" dur="3.24">Yahshua saying that the Levitical</text>
  <text start="1026.789" dur="3.54">priesthood has been done away with it</text>
  <text start="1028.23" dur="4.25">has not been done away with it is carnal</text>
  <text start="1030.329" dur="4.05">in that it will eventually have an end</text>
  <text start="1032.48" dur="5.349">Levitical priesthood and the animal</text>
  <text start="1034.379" dur="6.63">sacrifices will eventually go away will</text>
  <text start="1037.829" dur="6.12">eventually pass away after the 1000 year</text>
  <text start="1041.009" dur="4.591">kingdom after the Millennial Kingdom but</text>
  <text start="1043.949" dur="4.651">as of the first century of this writing</text>
  <text start="1045.6" dur="4.23">and as of throughout the Millennial</text>
  <text start="1048.6" dur="3.779">Kingdom which is still in our future</text>
  <text start="1049.83" dur="5.67">though that Levitical priesthood and the</text>
  <text start="1052.379" dur="4.561">the the animal sacrifices are all still</text>
  <text start="1055.5" dur="3.84">going to be accomplishing a purpose</text>
  <text start="1056.94" dur="5.189">which is simply to point back toward</text>
  <text start="1059.34" dur="4.49">what Yahshua did to provide a beautiful</text>
  <text start="1062.129" dur="4.201">shadow picture of what Yahshua did and</text>
  <text start="1063.83" dur="4.36">eventually of course that that part of</text>
  <text start="1066.33" dur="3.179">the Torah will pass away that is the</text>
  <text start="1068.19" dur="4.229">only part of the tour that will ever</text>
  <text start="1069.509" dur="4.681">pass away that is the only part of the</text>
  <text start="1072.419" dur="4.38">tour that will ever pass away because it</text>
  <text start="1074.19" dur="6.599">involves death and eventually death will</text>
  <text start="1076.799" dur="5.941">pass away so that&amp;#39;s very very important</text>
  <text start="1080.789" dur="4.98">to understand because many Christians</text>
  <text start="1082.74" dur="5.069">again try to misuse Hebrews 7 to say</text>
  <text start="1085.769" dur="4.471">that all the Torah is carnal and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1087.809" dur="4.59">all going to pass away and it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1090.24" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s ridiculous first of all not even</text>
  <text start="1092.399" dur="3.331">that part has passed away who hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1094.32" dur="2.459">even passed away as of the writing of</text>
  <text start="1095.73" dur="3.179">Hebrews because there were still</text>
  <text start="1096.779" dur="4.561">sacrifices going forth in the temple</text>
  <text start="1098.909" dur="4.89">when the author wrote this book and he</text>
  <text start="1101.34" dur="5.16">was using it as a as a reference point</text>
  <text start="1103.799" dur="5.521">to show how much she Asha was how I</text>
  <text start="1106.5" dur="3.51">Yahshua was superior to this so it</text>
  <text start="1109.32" dur="2.25">hadn&amp;#39;t even passed</text>
  <text start="1110.01" dur="3.96">way as of then it won&amp;#39;t pass away until</text>
  <text start="1111.57" dur="4.68">after the Millennial Kingdom but it will</text>
  <text start="1113.97" dur="4.29">eventually and then this is why Yahshua</text>
  <text start="1116.25" dur="3.78">is that the only one who by the way can</text>
  <text start="1118.26" dur="3.53">restore the Levitical priesthood back to</text>
  <text start="1120.03" dur="6.14">where it needs to be which he will do</text>
  <text start="1121.79" dur="8.88">before the 1000 year reign begins</text>
  <text start="1126.17" dur="9.75">alrighty so this is Hebrews chapter</text>
  <text start="1130.67" dur="5.25">seven hallelujah Shalom</text>
