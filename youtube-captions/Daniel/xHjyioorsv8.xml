  <text start="0.06" dur="4.799">shabbat shalom guys i wanted to get the</text>
  <text start="2.01" dur="5.88">perfect background for this teaching but</text>
  <text start="4.859" dur="4.651">the clouds are sort of you know lifting</text>
  <text start="7.89" dur="2.879">up and then coming down and lifting up</text>
  <text start="9.51" dur="3.48">and so it&amp;#39;s hard to get a good shot of</text>
  <text start="10.769" dur="5.04">the mountains today but i think this</text>
  <text start="12.99" dur="5.43">will work teaching us from john seven</text>
  <text start="15.809" dur="5.39">where Yahshua is actually observing the</text>
  <text start="18.42" dur="4.769">feast of Sukkot the Feast of Tabernacles</text>
  <text start="21.199" dur="4.931">so if you want to open your Bible to</text>
  <text start="23.189" dur="5.791">John seven this is actually a part about</text>
  <text start="26.13" dur="5.79">in the midst of the feast which today is</text>
  <text start="28.98" dur="4.53">day four were four days in and we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="31.92" dur="4.17">four days more to go so we&amp;#39;re literally</text>
  <text start="33.51" dur="4.92">in the midst of the feast so I wanted to</text>
  <text start="36.09" dur="4.129">read this it&amp;#39;s in John 7 if you start in</text>
  <text start="38.43" dur="5.25">verse 1 it says after these things</text>
  <text start="40.219" dur="5.381">Yahshua walked in Galilee for he would</text>
  <text start="43.68" dur="3.96">not walk injury because the Jews sought</text>
  <text start="45.6" dur="3.959">to kill him now the Jews Feast of</text>
  <text start="47.64" dur="4.14">Tabernacles was at hand and a Feast of</text>
  <text start="49.559" dur="3">Tabernacles is just another term for</text>
  <text start="51.78" dur="3.47">feast of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="52.559" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s that temporary dwelling structure</text>
  <text start="55.25" dur="4.93">his brethren therefore said unto Him</text>
  <text start="57.629" dur="4.441">come on depart hence and go into Judea</text>
  <text start="60.18" dur="4.11">Yahshua that you&amp;#39;re disciples also may</text>
  <text start="62.07" dur="3.96">see the works that you do for there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="64.29" dur="4.14">man that does anything in secret and he</text>
  <text start="66.03" dur="4.32">himself seeketh to be known openly if</text>
  <text start="68.43" dur="3.96">thou do these things show yourself to</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="4.86">the world so they were mocking him they</text>
  <text start="72.39" dur="5.7">were egging him on for neither did his</text>
  <text start="75.21" dur="5.64">brethren believe in him verse 5 verse 6</text>
  <text start="78.09" dur="4.709">then Yahshua said unto them my time has</text>
  <text start="80.85" dur="4.62">not yet come but your time is always</text>
  <text start="82.799" dur="4.921">ready the world cannot hate you but me</text>
  <text start="85.47" dur="5.039">it hates because I testify of it that</text>
  <text start="87.72" dur="5.13">the works their ever evil go you up into</text>
  <text start="90.509" dur="4.561">this feast I go not up yet under this</text>
  <text start="92.85" dur="4.35">feast for my time is not yet full come</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="4.08">oh does this mean Jesus is gonna break</text>
  <text start="97.2" dur="3.87">Torah because remember when that temple</text>
  <text start="99.15" dur="4.23">is in existence in Jerusalem the</text>
  <text start="101.07" dur="3.75">sanctified Temple Torah says you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="103.38" dur="4.29">commanded to go up to Jerusalem for the</text>
  <text start="104.82" dur="6.6">feast of Sukkot so as Jesus gonna break</text>
  <text start="107.67" dur="6.089">Torah no because if we keep reading it</text>
  <text start="111.42" dur="5.699">says when he had said these words unto</text>
  <text start="113.759" dur="5.97">them he abode still in Galilee but when</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="5.971">his brethren were gone up then when he</text>
  <text start="119.729" dur="4.471">also up unto the feast not openly but as</text>
  <text start="123.09" dur="2.73">it were in secret so he&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="124.2" dur="3.89">break Torah he&amp;#39;s gonna make sure he goes</text>
  <text start="125.82" dur="5.27">up and observes the feast of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="128.09" dur="3">hallelujah</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="4.65">verse 11 then the Jews sought Yahshua at</text>
  <text start="135.09" dur="4.02">the feast and said where is he of course</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="3.809">they want to murder him and there was</text>
  <text start="139.11" dur="3.989">much murmuring among the people</text>
  <text start="140.489" dur="3.42">concerning him for some said oh yea show</text>
  <text start="143.099" dur="3.661">is a good man</text>
  <text start="143.909" dur="6.211">another said no no he deceives the</text>
  <text start="146.76" dur="6.72">people obviou no man spake openly of him</text>
  <text start="150.12" dur="5.009">for fear of the Jews now about the midst</text>
  <text start="153.48" dur="5.52">of the feast so this would be day four</text>
  <text start="155.129" dur="5.61">right in the middle of Sukkot Yahshua</text>
  <text start="159" dur="4.62">went up into the temple and he taught</text>
  <text start="160.739" dur="5.28">and the Jews marveled saying how knows</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="4.14">this man letters having never learned he</text>
  <text start="166.019" dur="3.661">you know he&amp;#39;s just a was raised by a</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="4.16">carpenter in Nazareth has you know how</text>
  <text start="169.68" dur="4.199">does he have all this education and</text>
  <text start="171.92" dur="5.23">Yahshua answered them and said my</text>
  <text start="173.879" dur="6.061">doctrine is not mine but his that sent</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="4.229">me If any man will do his will he shall</text>
  <text start="179.94" dur="4.68">know of the doctrine whether it be of</text>
  <text start="181.379" dur="4.89">yah or whether I speak of myself he that</text>
  <text start="184.62" dur="3.929">speaketh of himself seeketh his own</text>
  <text start="186.269" dur="5.131">glory but he that seeketh his glory that</text>
  <text start="188.549" dur="5.58">sent him the same is true and no</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="5.309">unrighteousness is in him did not Moshe</text>
  <text start="194.129" dur="5.76">a give you the Torah and yet none of you</text>
  <text start="196.709" dur="6.03">keep the Torah ye go about to murder me</text>
  <text start="199.889" dur="5.041">so again he shows Yahshua who did keep</text>
  <text start="202.739" dur="3.75">the Torah he tells these Pharisees and</text>
  <text start="204.93" dur="3.66">Sadducees you know you&amp;#39;re claiming to</text>
  <text start="206.489" dur="3.421">keep the Torah but you don&amp;#39;t you know</text>
  <text start="208.59" dur="3.539">why cuz these a lot of these leaders</text>
  <text start="209.91" dur="3.479">were keeping the Talmud or old</text>
  <text start="212.129" dur="4.86">traditions that had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="213.389" dur="6.421">the Torah so why you go about to murder</text>
  <text start="216.989" dur="4.741">me and the people answered and said oh</text>
  <text start="219.81" dur="3.84">come on yah sure you&amp;#39;re crazy you have a</text>
  <text start="221.73" dur="4.74">devil who dudes going about trying to</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="4.769">murder you and Yahshua answered and said</text>
  <text start="226.47" dur="4.5">of them I have done one work and you all</text>
  <text start="228.419" dur="5.25">marvel mo che therefore gave unto you</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="4.169">circumcision not because it is of Moses</text>
  <text start="233.669" dur="3.57">but of the father&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="235.139" dur="4.02">circumcision came from Abraham and on</text>
  <text start="237.239" dur="3.991">the eighth day we are to circumcise our</text>
  <text start="239.159" dur="4.89">male child that&amp;#39;s a very good thing not</text>
  <text start="241.23" dur="4.17">only to reflect the interchange of the</text>
  <text start="244.049" dur="3.33">heart that will happen eventually</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="4.079">when that when we raise that young man</text>
  <text start="247.379" dur="4.47">to follow Yahshua but also it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.479" dur="4.531">cleanliness prevents infections so</text>
  <text start="251.849" dur="3.36">circumcision is a very good law that we</text>
  <text start="254.01" dur="3.77">should do on the eighth day of our</text>
  <text start="255.209" dur="2.571">baby&amp;#39;s lives</text>
  <text start="258.75" dur="4.41">and then yatra says even on the Sabbath</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="3.39">day you circumcised a man that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="263.16" dur="3.18">because if it falls on if the eighth day</text>
  <text start="264.57" dur="3.9">happens to fall in a Shabbat which is</text>
  <text start="266.34" dur="4.38">when my second child Elijah he fell his</text>
  <text start="268.47" dur="3.75">his eighth day fell on a Shabbat and we</text>
  <text start="270.72" dur="4.2">went and got him circumcised and yah</text>
  <text start="272.22" dur="5.93">blessed me with a beautiful tallit from</text>
  <text start="274.92" dur="6.3">the guy who circumsized Elijah</text>
  <text start="278.15" dur="4.63">that was my second born if a man on the</text>
  <text start="281.22" dur="3.15">Sabbath day receives circumcision that</text>
  <text start="282.78" dur="3.6">the law of Moses should not be broken</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="4.23">are you angry at me because I have made</text>
  <text start="286.38" dur="4.26">a man every whip hole on the Sabbath day</text>
  <text start="288.6" dur="4.02">so they were trying to accuse Yahshua</text>
  <text start="290.64" dur="4.41">that he was evil for healing people on</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="4.47">the Sabbath which is ridiculous there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="295.05" dur="4.11">nothing in the Torah that says you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="297.09" dur="3.33">heal on Shabbat nothing in fact the</text>
  <text start="299.16" dur="4.23">Torah says you&amp;#39;re supposed to do that</text>
  <text start="300.42" dur="4.53">which is good on Shabbat but again these</text>
  <text start="303.39" dur="2.97">Pharisees and Sadducees although they</text>
  <text start="304.95" dur="3.39">claim to follow - are they were really</text>
  <text start="306.36" dur="4.05">following their own oral traditions the</text>
  <text start="308.34" dur="4.22">Talmud which said you&amp;#39;re not supposed to</text>
  <text start="310.41" dur="4.95">even heal on Shabbat bunch of hypocrites</text>
  <text start="312.56" dur="5.05">and so vinyasa says judge not according</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="5.52">to the appearance but Judge righteous</text>
  <text start="317.61" dur="4.68">judgment so we are to judge but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="320.88" dur="3.03">making sure that judgment is righteous</text>
  <text start="322.29" dur="3.21">which we have to be submitted to Messiah</text>
  <text start="323.91" dur="3.54">and fill with the spirit to make</text>
  <text start="325.5" dur="3.78">righteous judgment that&amp;#39;s why Messiah</text>
  <text start="327.45" dur="3.6">said earlier he said judge not lest ye</text>
  <text start="329.28" dur="4.29">be judged and we go to verse 5 he says</text>
  <text start="331.05" dur="4.23">thou hypocrite first remove the sin out</text>
  <text start="333.57" dur="3.12">of your own life and then you can see</text>
  <text start="335.28" dur="3.93">clearly to judge the sin in someone</text>
  <text start="336.69" dur="3.93">else&amp;#39;s life so if you try to judge when</text>
  <text start="339.21" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s sin in your life guess what</text>
  <text start="340.62" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t judge lest you be judged but if</text>
  <text start="343.95" dur="3.3">you&amp;#39;re filled with the Messiah if you</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="5.04">have a spirit welling within you then he</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="5.64">says judge righteous judgment that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.91" dur="4.53">also confirmed by Apostle Paul rabbi</text>
  <text start="352.89" dur="5.07">shul on 1st Corinthians 2:15 through 16</text>
  <text start="355.44" dur="4.14">where he says a spiritual man judges all</text>
  <text start="357.96" dur="4.86">things but he himself has judged of no</text>
  <text start="359.58" dur="4.32">man for we have the mind of mashiac and</text>
  <text start="362.82" dur="3.09">that&amp;#39;s the privilege that&amp;#39;s the good</text>
  <text start="363.9" dur="4.61">news of the gospel that His Spirit fills</text>
  <text start="365.91" dur="5.85">us so we do have his mind hallelujah</text>
  <text start="368.51" dur="6.25">then said some of them of Jerusalem is</text>
  <text start="371.76" dur="5.58">not is is not this he I show them they</text>
  <text start="374.76" dur="4.08">seek to murder but lo he speaks boldly</text>
  <text start="377.34" dur="3.24">and they say nothing unto Him do the</text>
  <text start="378.84" dur="5.01">rulers know indeed that this is the very</text>
  <text start="380.58" dur="5.13">Messiah howbeit we know this man once he</text>
  <text start="383.85" dur="5.04">is but when Messiah comes no man knows</text>
  <text start="385.71" dur="4.95">once he is and then cried yash when the</text>
  <text start="388.89" dur="3.16">temple is he taught saying you both know</text>
  <text start="390.66" dur="5.259">me and you</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="5.85">whence I am and I am not come of myself</text>
  <text start="395.919" dur="4.65">but he that sent me is true whom you</text>
  <text start="397.9" dur="6.93">know not but I know him for I am from</text>
  <text start="400.569" dur="6.09">him and he has sent me and they sought</text>
  <text start="404.83" dur="3.51">to take him but no man laid hands on him</text>
  <text start="406.659" dur="4.47">because his hour was not yet come and</text>
  <text start="408.34" dur="4.71">many of the people believed on Yahshua</text>
  <text start="411.129" dur="3.811">and said when Messiah comes will he do</text>
  <text start="413.05" dur="4.679">more miracles than these which this man</text>
  <text start="414.94" dur="4.68">have done and the Pharisees hurt and the</text>
  <text start="417.729" dur="3.421">Pharisees heard that the people murmured</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="3.15">such things concerning him and the</text>
  <text start="421.15" dur="4.319">Pharisees and the chief priests sent</text>
  <text start="422.77" dur="4.92">officers to take Joshua then said</text>
  <text start="425.469" dur="3.991">Yahshua unto them yet a little while am</text>
  <text start="427.69" dur="2.279">i with you but then I go unto him that</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="2.759">sent me</text>

  <text start="432.219" dur="4.081">and where I am dither you cannot come</text>
