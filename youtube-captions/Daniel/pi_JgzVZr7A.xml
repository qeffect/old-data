  <text start="2.21" dur="6.429">Shalom and good morning it is the sixth</text>
  <text start="5.759" dur="5.781">day of Sukkot here at Cornerstone</text>
  <text start="8.639" dur="5.25">Baptist this is Daniel John Lee with</text>
  <text start="11.54" dur="4.33">Torah restoration ministries I wanted to</text>
  <text start="13.889" dur="4.681">just make a short video about the</text>
  <text start="15.87" dur="5.249">significance of the feasts since we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="18.57" dur="4.44">on well and what my mind is the</text>
  <text start="21.119" dur="4.351">granddaddy of all feasts a crown jewel</text>
  <text start="23.01" dur="4.14">of these which is the scope but just</text>
  <text start="25.47" dur="3.21">wanted to do this feel quickly just to</text>
  <text start="27.15" dur="3.15">show not only the piece but just the</text>
  <text start="28.68" dur="3.3">prophetic implications of these feasts</text>
  <text start="30.3" dur="3.18">just so that we understand and I also</text>
  <text start="31.98" dur="3.03">you&amp;#39;ll notice I didn&amp;#39;t just put the</text>
  <text start="33.48" dur="4.14">seven feasts stays a little bit against</text>
  <text start="35.01" dur="4.68">23 but I also put Hanukkah and Purim</text>
  <text start="37.62" dur="5.22">because Hanukkah actually you can go to</text>
  <text start="39.69" dur="4.56">John 10 where Jesus Yahshua actually</text>
  <text start="42.84" dur="3.449">observes Hanukkah he goes up to the</text>
  <text start="44.25" dur="3.39">temple to teach and then Purim is in the</text>
  <text start="46.289" dur="2.671">book of Esther so those are also</text>
  <text start="47.64" dur="4.88">scriptural feasts that were added in</text>
  <text start="48.96" dur="6.9">later and they all have very significant</text>
  <text start="52.52" dur="5.309">prophetic things so of course these are</text>
  <text start="55.86" dur="4.109">the ones that have already been done and</text>
  <text start="57.829" dur="4.361">I think everyone pretty much knows what</text>
  <text start="59.969" dur="3.991">happens Passover of course Josh was</text>
  <text start="62.19" dur="2.299">crucified he&amp;#39;s buried when with him</text>
  <text start="63.96" dur="3.63">ready</text>
  <text start="64.489" dur="6.181">he actually rises right before Shabbat</text>
  <text start="67.59" dur="5.639">ends and then by the day of firstfruits</text>
  <text start="70.67" dur="5.589">early Sunday morning they realize he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="4.14">risen and then he tells Mary my</text>
  <text start="76.259" dur="2.911">possession because he still has to</text>
  <text start="77.369" dur="3.18">ascend up to the Father and wave himself</text>
  <text start="79.17" dur="1.879">is the first fruit offering from among</text>
  <text start="80.549" dur="2.941">the dead</text>
  <text start="81.049" dur="4.21">and of course fifty days later we got</text>
  <text start="83.49" dur="3.57">the holy spirit so those are the ones</text>
  <text start="85.259" dur="4.591">that have already been done but we still</text>
  <text start="87.06" dur="4.53">keep them to remind ourselves of this</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="6.449">beautiful pattern plan of salvation</text>
  <text start="91.59" dur="6.84">right here his blood his death his</text>
  <text start="96.299" dur="5.521">resurrection power and filling with this</text>
  <text start="98.43" dur="4.71">spirit right here oh yeah and the fall</text>
  <text start="101.82" dur="2.579">was these are the excited the real</text>
  <text start="103.14" dur="2.58">exciting ones that I&amp;#39;m looking forward</text>
  <text start="104.399" dur="3.621">to because they have not been done yet</text>
  <text start="105.72" dur="4.469">so we got Yom to release the trumpets</text>
  <text start="108.02" dur="3.79">this is going to be filled at the end of</text>
  <text start="110.189" dur="5.79">the Great Tribulation at the seventh</text>

  <text start="128.34" dur="6.84">three and a half year testimony against</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="8.94">the beast and we all meet on the clouds</text>
  <text start="135.18" dur="7.79">first Thessalonians 4 yeah Acts chapter</text>

  <text start="142.97" dur="5.29">and so we go up to me feminine Yom</text>
  <text start="145.95" dur="5.399">Kippur is the CF firing last revelation</text>
  <text start="148.26" dur="6.21">15 that&amp;#39;s where we all get our rewards</text>
  <text start="151.349" dur="5.22">in heaven and while we&amp;#39;re up there the</text>
  <text start="154.47" dur="6.269">armies of the Beast are gathering and</text>
  <text start="156.569" dur="7.17">the valley of Armageddon so coat is of</text>
  <text start="160.739" dur="4.711">course the seven-day waiting period a</text>
  <text start="163.739" dur="3.421">number eight but it&amp;#39;s the marriage</text>

  <text start="167.16" dur="4.47">heaven we&amp;#39;re still in heaven by the way</text>
  <text start="169.019" dur="5.69">during this whole time then we got the</text>
  <text start="171.63" dur="5.609">last great day this is revelation 19</text>
  <text start="174.709" dur="7.901">it&amp;#39;s also talked about in Jude Zechariah</text>
  <text start="177.239" dur="7.59">14 we return with Yahshua that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.61" dur="18.029">interesting and I Christ has destroyed</text>
  <text start="184.829" dur="17.611">looks like the devil didn&amp;#39;t like that so</text>
  <text start="200.639" dur="3.151">this is where Yahshua returns that the</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="3.69">brightness of his coming and the breath</text>
  <text start="203.79" dur="4.59">of his mouth and throws the false</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="3.99">prophet and the beast into the lake of</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="4.68">fire destroys the armies that are</text>
  <text start="210.12" dur="4.949">gathered around Jerusalem and we got the</text>
  <text start="213.06" dur="3.57">1000 year reign in Revelation 20 begins</text>
  <text start="215.069" dur="3.091">and we rule and reign with Yahshua and</text>
  <text start="216.63" dur="4.829">our glorified bodies and that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="218.16" dur="5.609">returned to earth with him and then</text>
  <text start="221.459" dur="4.5">Hanukkah of that year whatever this all</text>
  <text start="223.769" dur="4.56">happens the temple will be rededicated</text>
  <text start="225.959" dur="3.691">for the 1,080 reign of Christ and there</text>
  <text start="228.329" dur="4.41">will be an actual temple you can read</text>
  <text start="229.65" dur="4.83">about that in Zechariah 14 last four</text>
  <text start="232.739" dur="6.72">chapters of Ezekiel I believe in Malachi</text>
  <text start="234.48" dur="6.96">3 that&amp;#39;s 1,000 starts two thousand year</text>
  <text start="239.459" dur="3.93">reign and then Purim is out of order</text>
  <text start="241.44" dur="3.72">because the hidden feast the firm is the</text>
  <text start="243.389" dur="4.081">last feast technically on the calendar</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="3.409">year it happens in late winter just</text>
  <text start="247.47" dur="3.769">about a month or two</text>
  <text start="248.569" dur="5.161">for Passover but Purim is actually about</text>
  <text start="251.239" dur="3.9">the abomination of desolation that</text>
  <text start="253.73" dur="3.719">begins three and a half years prior to</text>
  <text start="255.139" dur="5.31">great jubilation so this kicks off the</text>
  <text start="257.449" dur="4.651">1290 days in Daniel the 1260 days</text>
  <text start="260.449" dur="3.261">happens a little bit after that month</text>
  <text start="262.1" dur="3.96">after that it&amp;#39;s also related to the</text>
  <text start="263.71" dur="3.91">1,335 days but I don&amp;#39;t have time to get</text>
  <text start="266.06" dur="3.75">into all that that&amp;#39;s in the Book of</text>
  <text start="267.62" dur="3.6">Daniel but the abomination desolation</text>
  <text start="269.81" dur="3.3">has tried to burn that&amp;#39;s why Yahshua</text>
  <text start="271.22" dur="3.81">says pray that your flight not be on</text>
  <text start="273.11" dur="3.72">Shabbat or in the winter for when that</text>
  <text start="275.03" dur="3.65">does happen it&amp;#39;ll be Great Tribulation</text>
  <text start="276.83" dur="4.08">and perm is always in the late winter</text>
  <text start="278.68" dur="4.48">those two days are sort of considered</text>
  <text start="280.91" dur="4.08">Sabbath days you know Mordecai&amp;#39;s for you</text>
  <text start="283.16" dur="3.45">to say we&amp;#39;re supposed to rest there or</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="2.1">it might just happen on an actual weekly</text>
  <text start="286.61" dur="2.61">Shabbat</text>
  <text start="287.09" dur="4.71">near perm or it might be a year in which</text>
  <text start="289.22" dur="5.879">perm falls on a Shabbat who knows weekly</text>
  <text start="291.8" dur="5.91">Shabbat but in any case so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="295.099" dur="4.861">interesting because Purim and yom teruah</text>
  <text start="297.71" dur="3.51">are reversed in the timeline so this is</text>
  <text start="299.96" dur="6.12">the end of the three and a half years</text>
  <text start="301.22" dur="6.449">and this is the beginning so I hope</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="5.22">everyone was able to hear me I know that</text>
  <text start="307.669" dur="5.37">when I&amp;#39;m standing behind the iPad it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="3.929">hard to hear so hopefully you guys all</text>
  <text start="313.039" dur="3.62">heard that or easily saw it and you can</text>
  <text start="315.229" dur="3.75">study this out for yourself</text>
