  <text start="148.89" dur="4.89">hallelujah look thing i love about the</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="4.89">Psalms as they go through the wide range</text>
  <text start="153.78" dur="4.26">of emotions you know David and the</text>
  <text start="156.57" dur="6.69">others who wrote these Psalms they were</text>
  <text start="158.04" dur="8.01">never never never afraid to express</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="4.71">their full emotions to Yahshua and yet</text>
  <text start="166.05" dur="6.39">they were always very very thankful to</text>
  <text start="167.97" dur="6.96">him so I I love that I love that the</text>
  <text start="172.44" dur="5.16">last week last shabbat there was just</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="6.18">this huge breakthrough at the</text>
  <text start="177.6" dur="5.16">congregation that i attend khm we all</text>
  <text start="181.11" dur="4.02">had to meet in sort of a smaller room</text>
  <text start="182.76" dur="3.96">because the sanctuary that we normally</text>
  <text start="185.13" dur="5.61">used was was being used for other</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="5.91">purposes and Phillip who goes there was</text>
  <text start="190.74" dur="4.08">able to use his guitar to lead the</text>
  <text start="192.63" dur="5.22">praise and worship and man the spirit</text>
  <text start="194.82" dur="5.639">just came in so powerfully and it was</text>
  <text start="197.85" dur="6.66">just it was just awesome it was just a</text>
  <text start="200.459" dur="6">major major breakthrough at khm and then</text>
  <text start="204.51" dur="3.36">when the pastor was giving his lesson we</text>
  <text start="206.459" dur="4.081">were able to interact with him and it</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="4.05">was more like a kind of like style</text>
  <text start="210.54" dur="2.85">almost like a Jewish synagogue where</text>
  <text start="211.92" dur="3.78">there was actually interaction between</text>
  <text start="213.39" dur="5.46">us and the pasture and it was just a</text>
  <text start="215.7" dur="5.34">really really edifying time so that was</text>
  <text start="218.85" dur="5.28">a that was a huge blessing and then</text>
  <text start="221.04" dur="4.62">Jerry and I we went to a park toward</text>
  <text start="224.13" dur="4.109">sunset toward evening and just had a</text>
  <text start="225.66" dur="6.24">really good time of preaching and</text>
  <text start="228.239" dur="6.301">interacting with people there and just</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="4.64">reaching people that are still still</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="4.77">embracing the message still wanting to</text>
  <text start="236.54" dur="3.669">at least being edified by some of the</text>
  <text start="239.31" dur="2.429">things that we&amp;#39;re saying of course</text>
  <text start="240.209" dur="3.5">obviously we&amp;#39;re always going to have</text>
  <text start="241.739" dur="4.861">people that don&amp;#39;t like what we&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="243.709" dur="4.961">because people general in this culture</text>
  <text start="246.6" dur="6.72">don&amp;#39;t like the truth but we out it was</text>
  <text start="248.67" dur="6.66">it&amp;#39;s always a blessing to have someone</text>
  <text start="253.32" dur="4.44">like I had this one guy named Isaac came</text>
  <text start="255.33" dur="4.5">up and actually shook by hand and was</text>
