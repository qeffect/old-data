  <text start="2.82" dur="7.79">Torah restoration ministries the website</text>
  <text start="5.37" dur="9.54">is WWE tag team and this is episode 45</text>
  <text start="10.61" dur="10.77">another proof 2017 is the year of</text>
  <text start="14.91" dur="9.09">messiahs return and this past Sabbath or</text>
  <text start="21.38" dur="4.93">maybe was the first day of the week but</text>
  <text start="24" dur="5.76">a couple days ago a good friend of mine</text>
  <text start="26.31" dur="7.65">and I we were going over an article that</text>
  <text start="29.76" dur="7.319">she found and it is an article about the</text>
  <text start="33.96" dur="5.7">biblical significance of the number 17</text>
  <text start="37.079" dur="6.121">and we&amp;#39;re actually going to add a link</text>
  <text start="39.66" dur="5.46">to this article as well as to some</text>
  <text start="43.2" dur="5.22">additional articles to supplement this</text>
  <text start="45.12" dur="6.209">on the website so keep your eyes open on</text>
  <text start="48.42" dur="4.889">the recommended links videos page</text>
  <text start="51.329" dur="3.931">because that&amp;#39;s where it will be it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="53.309" dur="6.241">under a special section entitled the</text>
  <text start="55.26" dur="6.09">biblical significance of number 17 but</text>
  <text start="59.55" dur="3.66">as she was showing me this article I</text>
  <text start="61.35" dur="5.37">began to realize that this was just</text>
  <text start="63.21" dur="6.659">another series of very strong proofs</text>
  <text start="66.72" dur="7.52">that 2017 will indeed be the year of</text>
  <text start="69.869" dur="4.371">Messiah she was returned to Planet Earth</text>
  <text start="74.78" dur="7.409">first of all the first half of the</text>
  <text start="78.689" dur="6.781">article shows how the number 17 is a</text>
  <text start="82.189" dur="5.231">significant factor in the number 153 and</text>
  <text start="85.47" dur="4.23">he shows us mathematically but like if</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="5.25">you multiply 17 times 9 you come out to</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="5.16">153 and of course 153 that number is</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="4.44">only used one time in Scripture and that</text>
  <text start="94.86" dur="4.14">is with the fishes 153 fishes that are</text>
  <text start="97.11" dur="9.689">in Yahshua&amp;#39;s net so we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="99" dur="9.689">his redeemed ones his Saints um now the</text>
  <text start="106.799" dur="4.171">first significant thing about the number</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="4.14">17 is we know that Yahshua was crucified</text>
  <text start="110.97" dur="4.289">on the fourteenth day of the first month</text>
  <text start="112.829" dur="4.201">that would have been Passover well he</text>
  <text start="115.259" dur="4.14">was also in the earth for three days and</text>
  <text start="117.03" dur="3.869">three nights so if you go three days and</text>
  <text start="119.399" dur="3.211">three nights into the future what day do</text>
  <text start="120.899" dur="5.01">you come to when he resurrected and that</text>
  <text start="122.61" dur="7.519">would have been the 17th day so the</text>
  <text start="125.909" dur="7.231">number 17 is is strongly linked to</text>
  <text start="130.129" dur="3.821">resurrection that is the day of the</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="3.27">month on which the law</text>
  <text start="133.95" dur="4.5">rose from the dead having been slain as</text>
  <text start="136.41" dur="3.54">the Paschal Lamb on the fourteenth day</text>
  <text start="138.45" dur="5.25">of the month and raised to life on the</text>
  <text start="139.95" dur="5.19">third day the 17th is also the day of</text>
  <text start="143.7" dur="3.21">the month and this would have occurred</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="5.79">in the month of Zen the second the</text>
  <text start="146.91" dur="5.43">second month but the the 17th is the day</text>
  <text start="150.93" dur="4.47">of the month that the flood of Noah&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.34" dur="5.97">day began lifting the ark off the</text>
  <text start="155.4" dur="4.08">surface of the ground it was also the</text>
  <text start="158.31" dur="4.89">day of the month that the ark came to</text>
  <text start="159.48" dur="5.97">rest again upon the ground so we have</text>
  <text start="163.2" dur="4.71">both the ark being lifted up and then</text>
  <text start="165.45" dur="6.629">coming back down just like on yom teruah</text>
  <text start="167.91" dur="6.329">when it&amp;#39;s fulfilled in 2017 we are</text>
  <text start="172.079" dur="3.811">lifted up off the ground we meet Yahshua</text>
  <text start="174.239" dur="3.33">there and then we come back down to rule</text>
  <text start="175.89" dur="4.95">and reign with him for a thousand years</text>
  <text start="177.569" dur="9.931">so 17 the number 17 continues to wrap</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="8.729">around this concept of Resurrection you</text>
  <text start="187.5" dur="3.63">may wonder why it is that if there is</text>
  <text start="189.569" dur="3.181">indeed the resurrection number the Lord</text>
  <text start="191.13" dur="2.79">was not also raised on the third day of</text>
  <text start="192.75" dur="3.569">the month and on the third day of the</text>
  <text start="193.92" dur="4.08">week I have no answer for the wives of</text>
  <text start="196.319" dur="3.57">many kinds but I do believe that many</text>
  <text start="198" dur="3.299">complex legal requirements pretending to</text>
  <text start="199.889" dur="3.961">his death and what he accomplished by it</text>
  <text start="201.299" dur="4.921">were not met with precision he was</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="3.84">raised on the third day of the third set</text>
  <text start="206.22" dur="3.359">of seven days counted from the beginning</text>
  <text start="207.69" dur="3.359">of the month which was the seventeenth</text>
  <text start="209.579" dur="12.181">day of the month so again we have the</text>
  <text start="211.049" dur="14.671">number 17 so just remember that the 17</text>
  <text start="221.76" dur="5.58">is always very much tied in with with</text>
  <text start="225.72" dur="3.239">the resurrection now looking away from</text>
  <text start="227.34" dur="3.36">the Bible if we look at an Italian</text>
  <text start="228.959" dur="5.131">culture the number 17 is considered</text>
  <text start="230.7" dur="5.159">unlucky very much how many in the</text>
  <text start="234.09" dur="3.63">Western culture consider the number 13</text>
  <text start="235.859" dur="3.931">to be unlucky the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="4.62">because the Roman numeral for 17 which</text>
  <text start="239.79" dur="5.22">is the X and then the V and then the 1:1</text>
  <text start="242.34" dur="6.179">which can be changed and a grammatically</text>
  <text start="245.01" dur="5.55">2v1 x1 in Latin V when x1 translates to</text>
  <text start="248.519" dur="4.351">I have lived or in the perfect tense my</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="4.109">life is over this is fascinating because</text>
  <text start="252.87" dur="3.959">this is how it is with resurrection the</text>
  <text start="254.669" dur="3.69">old life is over and the new life begins</text>
  <text start="256.829" dur="4.65">so even when we look at pagan culture</text>
  <text start="258.359" dur="6.361">the number 17 again talks about a new</text>
  <text start="261.479" dur="5.43">beginning and a resurrection now this is</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="2.48">really fascinating the number 17 has</text>
  <text start="266.909" dur="3.831">some</text>
  <text start="267.2" dur="7.97">unique geometrical features a hypercube</text>
  <text start="270.74" dur="8.7">cut along 17 faces unfolds into a</text>
  <text start="275.17" dur="10.09">three-dimensional cross now that&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="8.01">thought that was amazing now I want to</text>
  <text start="285.26" dur="4.38">quote from the King James code and this</text>
  <text start="287.45" dur="5.43">is by a man named Michael Howe guard he</text>
  <text start="289.64" dur="5.16">is a Southern Baptist minister whom I</text>
  <text start="292.88" dur="5.04">greatly respect he comes out with a lot</text>
  <text start="294.8" dur="4.65">of great information but to quote him he</text>
  <text start="297.92" dur="4.68">says as we will see in the following</text>
  <text start="299.45" dur="5.6">analysis the number 17 overwhelmingly</text>
  <text start="302.6" dur="6.93">represents the completion of time and</text>
  <text start="305.05" dur="6.01">change or transformation simply put it</text>
  <text start="309.53" dur="5.91">represents the change that will take</text>
  <text start="311.06" dur="6.15">place at the end of time now what change</text>
  <text start="315.44" dur="3.54">or transformation occurs at the end of</text>
  <text start="317.21" dur="4.14">time well we know this it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="318.98" dur="4.65">yawn through is fulfilled at the end of</text>
  <text start="321.35" dur="3.9">the tribulation and we are transformed</text>
  <text start="323.63" dur="3.36">we are changed in the blink of an eye</text>
  <text start="325.25" dur="4.56">and then right in Revelation it says</text>
  <text start="326.99" dur="4.23">when that happens this angel that has</text>
  <text start="329.81" dur="2.91">one foot in the sea and one from the</text>
  <text start="331.22" dur="5.58">earth declares that there will be time</text>
  <text start="332.72" dur="5.34">no more the article goes on to say now</text>
  <text start="336.8" dur="2.55">I&amp;#39;m not validating that authors</text>
  <text start="338.06" dur="2.88">conclusions but there are some good</text>
  <text start="339.35" dur="4.8">insights and observations made that are</text>
  <text start="340.94" dur="6.39">worth repeating here what I see in 17 is</text>
  <text start="344.15" dur="5.28">the transition from flesh to spirit that</text>
  <text start="347.33" dur="4.26">is exactly what Paul describes in first</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="6.12">Corinthians 15 when he describes our</text>
  <text start="351.59" dur="5.85">future resurrection that the corruptible</text>
  <text start="355.55" dur="4.83">flesh the mortal cannot inherit</text>
  <text start="357.44" dur="8.12">immortality but it is only the</text>
  <text start="360.38" dur="8.49">uncorruptible the the spirit Michael</text>
  <text start="365.56" dur="5.38">references what I know as the infinity</text>
  <text start="368.87" dur="4.23">code as promised by as promoted by Al</text>
  <text start="370.94" dur="4.2">Neil where numbers meeting is able to be</text>
  <text start="373.1" dur="4.55">observed in the Bible in the chapter so</text>
  <text start="375.14" dur="5.34">numbered if you look in Genesis chapter</text>
  <text start="377.65" dur="6.01">17 you will find a very crucial event</text>
  <text start="380.48" dur="6.42">taking place the covenant is made</text>
  <text start="383.66" dur="6.63">between y and Avram with the promise of</text>
  <text start="386.9" dur="5.97">Isaac given the consequent changing of</text>
  <text start="390.29" dur="5.13">his and Sarai&amp;#39;s names and the</text>
  <text start="392.87" dur="3.96">establishing of the circumcision from</text>
  <text start="395.42" dur="3.41">that which is after the flesh to that</text>
  <text start="396.83" dur="4.35">which is after the spirit a transition</text>
  <text start="398.83" dur="4.6">time&amp;#39;s up for the flesh time</text>
  <text start="401.18" dur="4.89">right for the spirit so Genesis 17 is</text>
  <text start="403.43" dur="4.65">all about transitioning from a fleshly</text>
  <text start="406.07" dur="5.069">way of doing things to a spiritual way</text>
  <text start="408.08" dur="4.61">of doing things so because 17 is so</text>
  <text start="411.139" dur="4.771">wrapped up in this concept of</text>
  <text start="412.69" dur="5.5">resurrection of transformation of</text>
  <text start="415.91" dur="6.72">transition of a new beginning in both</text>
  <text start="418.19" dur="6.81">the biblical context and in the pagan</text>
  <text start="422.63" dur="6.03">context and in the mathematical context</text>
  <text start="425" dur="6.69">I think this is just a further proof</text>
  <text start="428.66" dur="5.97">that 2017 will be the year of our</text>
  <text start="431.69" dur="6.42">resurrection it will be the the year</text>
  <text start="434.63" dur="6.42">when yom teruah is fulfilled when we as</text>
  <text start="438.11" dur="5.61">his Saints are resurrected when our old</text>
  <text start="441.05" dur="7.29">life dies our flesh dies and our spirit</text>
  <text start="443.72" dur="9.06">is is revived and we undergo an amazing</text>
  <text start="448.34" dur="6.329">and and thorough transformation and and</text>
  <text start="452.78" dur="3.93">that this is all tied up in that number</text>
  <text start="454.669" dur="4.021">17 and that is why Yahshua and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.71" dur="6.17">why the father has chosen in his divine</text>
  <text start="458.69" dur="7.83">wisdom and foresight that the year 2017</text>
  <text start="462.88" dur="7.509">would be the year in which were drawn up</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="6.72">to meet him so it&amp;#39;s just that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.389" dur="5.221">too many things involving Resurrection</text>
  <text start="473.24" dur="4.08">transformation the transition from flesh</text>
  <text start="475.61" dur="5.67">of spirit that are tied up in this</text>
  <text start="477.32" dur="5.49">number to ignore it so like I said we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.28" dur="5.069">going to we&amp;#39;re going to put these</text>
  <text start="482.81" dur="5.43">articles up on the website very soon and</text>
  <text start="486.349" dur="4.201">in fact when we do I&amp;#39;ll make an</text>
  <text start="488.24" dur="4.049">announcement on a future podcast when</text>
  <text start="490.55" dur="5.85">all that&amp;#39;s been done but keep your up</text>
  <text start="492.289" dur="5.94">keep your eyes on the the tabs and when</text>
  <text start="496.4" dur="4.259">when you see the recommended articles</text>

  <text start="500.659" dur="4.171">things like that just click on there and</text>
  <text start="502.479" dur="5.53">we&amp;#39;ll have this whole section there for</text>
  <text start="504.83" dur="6.149">you under that tab but to me it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="508.009" dur="5.431">very clear that the number 17 is all</text>
  <text start="510.979" dur="4.591">about our resurrection all about</text>
  <text start="513.44" dur="4.589">Yahshua&amp;#39;s resurrection it&amp;#39;s directly</text>
  <text start="515.57" dur="4.829">tied to 153 fish which you know that</text>
  <text start="518.029" dur="5.041">represents the present-day believers and</text>
  <text start="520.399" dur="5.25">Saints or the Saints over the last 2000</text>
  <text start="523.07" dur="3.36">years since Yahshua came and it&amp;#39;s those</text>
  <text start="525.649" dur="5.611">believers they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="526.43" dur="7.37">resurrected on this day so keep your</text>
  <text start="531.26" dur="4.94">eyes on the sky because</text>
  <text start="533.8" dur="5.94">um here we are at the end of 2011 we got</text>
  <text start="536.2" dur="5.91">six years to go and and I firmly believe</text>
  <text start="539.74" dur="6.69">this is just another verification and</text>
  <text start="542.11" dur="6.84">revelation to to confirm that 2017 will</text>
  <text start="546.43" dur="7.26">be the year of Messiah Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="548.95" dur="6.18">returned and in more short a more</text>
  <text start="553.69" dur="3.51">short-term outlook I think that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.13" dur="4.05">looking at a very Swift and rapid</text>
  <text start="557.2" dur="3.12">economic collapse possibly to start in</text>
  <text start="559.18" dur="3.75">Europe and then to spread to the United</text>
  <text start="560.32" dur="4.889">States and worldwide in the coming weeks</text>
