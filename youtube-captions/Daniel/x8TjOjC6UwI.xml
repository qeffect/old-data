  <text start="4.47" dur="6.6">is the Sabbath day April 12 2014 or Aviv</text>
  <text start="8.22" dur="5.669">12 the 12th day of the first Hebrew</text>
  <text start="11.07" dur="4.47">month and this is a very special Sabbath</text>
  <text start="13.889" dur="4.381">because this is the Sabbath the last</text>
  <text start="15.54" dur="4.77">Sabbath right before Passover and then</text>
  <text start="18.27" dur="5.28">the seven-day feast of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="20.31" dur="6.78">which we as followers of Messiah Yahshua</text>
  <text start="23.55" dur="5.16">are commanded to observe and actually</text>
  <text start="27.09" dur="3.9">this feast Passover am the piece of</text>
  <text start="28.71" dur="4.77">unleavened bread brings us very very</text>
  <text start="30.99" dur="5.13">very close to Yahshua much much closer</text>
  <text start="33.48" dur="4.22">than the pagan Ishtar and Good Friday</text>
  <text start="36.12" dur="4.95">that actually have nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="37.7" dur="5.769">Yahshua and what he did I&amp;#39;ve gotten a</text>
  <text start="41.07" dur="4.32">couple of emails through the web and</text>
  <text start="43.469" dur="3.93">through others that friends that I know</text>
  <text start="45.39" dur="4.56">that have been asking me questions</text>
  <text start="47.399" dur="4.471">regarding how I observe Passover how</text>
  <text start="49.95" dur="4.019">exactly do you do it do you do do the</text>
  <text start="51.87" dur="3.63">Seder or do you just do the the bread</text>
  <text start="53.969" dur="3.601">and the juice like what you see in</text>
  <text start="55.5" dur="5.309">Yahshua&amp;#39;s Last Supper or how does that</text>
  <text start="57.57" dur="5.009">all work and so I thought I&amp;#39;d I thought</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="6.271">I would make a podcast addressing that</text>
  <text start="62.579" dur="6.36">that those questions basically the</text>
  <text start="67.08" dur="3.12">simple answer is I do both because I</text>
  <text start="68.939" dur="4.621">think that that&amp;#39;s what fits the</text>
  <text start="70.2" dur="5.489">scriptural model so today is the 12th of</text>
  <text start="73.56" dur="3.629">Aviv tomorrow is the 13th of Eve of</text>
  <text start="75.689" dur="3.18">these next couple of days what we do is</text>
  <text start="77.189" dur="3.271">we clean out all the leaven make sure we</text>
  <text start="78.869" dur="3.591">get all the leaven out of our homes out</text>
  <text start="80.46" dur="4.29">of our cars out of our dwelling places</text>
  <text start="82.46" dur="3.339">anything with leaven products in it get</text>
  <text start="84.75" dur="3.75">it out so that you&amp;#39;re not eating</text>
  <text start="85.799" dur="5.131">anything with leaven and then tomorrow</text>
  <text start="88.5" dur="5.52">night Sunday night which will be the end</text>
  <text start="90.93" dur="5.34">of of Eve 13 because remember a day</text>
  <text start="94.02" dur="3.69">according to Genesis if there&amp;#39;s evening</text>
  <text start="96.27" dur="3.75">in there is morning begins in the</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="3.96">evening and then goes to the next</text>
  <text start="100.02" dur="3.87">evening so that&amp;#39;s how a day is in Hebrew</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="3.12">it begins in the evening or at sunset</text>
  <text start="103.89" dur="2.909">when it gets dark</text>
  <text start="104.79" dur="6.21">not at midnight like the world does it</text>
  <text start="106.799" dur="6.061">so tomorrow evening Sunday night Aviv 13</text>
  <text start="111" dur="3.96">the thirteenth day will be transitioning</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="4.53">into the fourteenth day of Eve and of</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="3.81">course that was the same night the</text>
  <text start="117.39" dur="3.839">beginning of the 14th of you that</text>
  <text start="118.77" dur="5.19">Yahshua had what&amp;#39;s known as the Last</text>
  <text start="121.229" dur="4.74">Supper with his disciples and so</text>
  <text start="123.96" dur="4.1">tomorrow night Sunday night is the night</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="4.531">where I will gather with friends and</text>
  <text start="128.06" dur="5.94">I&amp;#39;ll take out the unleavened bread and</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="5.66">the wine and what we&amp;#39;ll do</text>
  <text start="134" dur="5.18">is will go what I what I like to do is I</text>
  <text start="136.16" dur="6.57">go through all four Gospel accounts of</text>
  <text start="139.18" dur="5.77">the Last Supper of what Yahshua said</text>
  <text start="142.73" dur="5.97">what he did and I read through all of</text>
  <text start="144.95" dur="5.46">those and partake of the unleavened</text>
  <text start="148.7" dur="3.57">bread and juice as we go through all</text>
  <text start="150.41" dur="4.2">four of them and then I also like to do</text>
  <text start="152.27" dur="5.1">the fifth gospel which is the book of</text>
  <text start="154.61" dur="4.23">Revelation reading about how Yahshua</text>
  <text start="157.37" dur="4.02">will not drink of the fruit of the vine</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="6.09">again until we have the wedding supper</text>
  <text start="161.39" dur="5.49">with him hallelujah in the heavenlies so</text>
  <text start="164.93" dur="3.69">I do that on the 13th of a V or what it</text>
  <text start="166.88" dur="4.35">will be this year will be tomorrow night</text>
  <text start="168.62" dur="5.82">Sunday night April 13th going at April</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="6.509">14th and then of course as you read in</text>
  <text start="174.44" dur="4.769">the Gospels Yahshua is then betrayed he</text>
  <text start="177.739" dur="3.781">goes to the garden because cemani where</text>
  <text start="179.209" dur="4.561">he&amp;#39;s betrayed he&amp;#39;s arrested and that</text>
  <text start="181.52" dur="3.66">night into the next day as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="183.77" dur="3.24">continuing through the 14th of Aviv</text>
  <text start="185.18" dur="3.66">which this year of course will be going</text>
  <text start="187.01" dur="4.83">through Sunday night into Monday</text>
  <text start="188.84" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s when Yahshua is put on trial and</text>
  <text start="191.84" dur="4.35">then he&amp;#39;s crucified he&amp;#39;s slaughtered as</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="5.16">the Lamb of yah and of course that&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="196.19" dur="4.89">Monday this year and that is the day</text>
  <text start="198.89" dur="5.19">where the of course the lambs are</text>
  <text start="201.08" dur="5.189">slaughtered and then that evening Monday</text>
  <text start="204.08" dur="4.56">evening the 14th of Eve as you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="206.269" dur="4.201">into the fifteenth day of Eve or the</text>
  <text start="208.64" dur="4.5">first day of unleavened bread which is a</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="5.85">high Sabbath that is when you have the</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="6.599">Passover Seder or the Passover Exodus 12</text>
  <text start="216.32" dur="4.53">meal it&amp;#39;s detailed in Exodus 12 what</text>
  <text start="219.739" dur="3">you&amp;#39;re supposed to do that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="220.85" dur="4.77">supposed to eat a lamb with unleavened</text>
  <text start="222.739" dur="6.361">bread bitter herbs with a staff in your</text>
  <text start="225.62" dur="6">hand with your feet shod and so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="229.1" dur="4.609">what I&amp;#39;ll be doing is that on toward the</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="4.88">end of the day on Monday Monday evening</text>
  <text start="233.709" dur="7.211">late afternoon early evening going into</text>
  <text start="236.5" dur="6.88">Tuesday Monday night that will be when I</text>
  <text start="240.92" dur="4.8">have the full meal with my friends and</text>
  <text start="243.38" dur="5.52">family and we eat of a Passover we eat</text>
  <text start="245.72" dur="4.71">of the the lamb the bitter herbs the the</text>
  <text start="248.9" dur="4.08">unleavened bread and we go through</text>
  <text start="250.43" dur="6.6">Exodus 12 and we read through that and</text>
  <text start="252.98" dur="5.43">and what it symbolizes so so I I do both</text>
  <text start="257.03" dur="3.63">of them and that&amp;#39;s how I kick off</text>
  <text start="258.41" dur="4.95">Passover week and then of course for the</text>
  <text start="260.66" dur="5.129">next seven days from from you know</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="4.559">basically from Monday night or Tuesday</text>
  <text start="265.789" dur="3.69">all the way through next Monday</text>
  <text start="267.919" dur="4.231">for the next seven days as the seven</text>
  <text start="269.479" dur="5.521">days of unleavened bread where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="4.5">supposed to ensure that we don&amp;#39;t eat</text>
  <text start="275" dur="4.59">anything with leaven okay that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="5.609">only if we&amp;#39;re gonna eat any bread</text>
  <text start="279.59" dur="9.06">quote-unquote bread products that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.259" dur="7.831">unleavened and remember that Tuesday</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="3.12">which is the first day of unleavened</text>
  <text start="290.09" dur="3.299">bread so that&amp;#39;s the first day after</text>
  <text start="291.77" dur="3.45">Passover which begins Monday night this</text>
  <text start="293.389" dur="3.87">year going into Tuesday that is a high</text>
  <text start="295.22" dur="3.33">Sabbath Tuesday is the first day of</text>
  <text start="297.259" dur="2.37">unleavened bread and then the seventh</text>
  <text start="298.55" dur="4.92">day of unleavened bread which is the</text>
  <text start="299.629" dur="6.69">following Monday will also be a Sabbath</text>
  <text start="303.47" dur="5.22">so both of those days will be Sabbath&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.319" dur="4.021">they&amp;#39;re considered high Sabbath&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="308.69" dur="3.18">those are days where we don&amp;#39;t work we</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t do any business or anything like</text>
  <text start="311.87" dur="4.139">that but we&amp;#39;re actually commanded to</text>
  <text start="314.12" dur="3.69">join with our brothers and sisters in</text>
  <text start="316.009" dur="3.361">Messiah and to fellowship and and to</text>
  <text start="317.81" dur="4.28">relax and it&amp;#39;s like a regular weekly</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="5.729">Shabbat except it&amp;#39;s not on a Saturday so</text>
  <text start="322.09" dur="7.66">I hope that answers the question I the</text>
  <text start="325.099" dur="6.57">reason I do both the the what Christians</text>
  <text start="329.75" dur="5.46">would call the Last Supper or the the</text>
  <text start="331.669" dur="5.731">New Covenant meal I do both that as the</text>
  <text start="335.21" dur="4.98">14th of Aviv begins and then I do the</text>
  <text start="337.4" dur="6.509">the Passover Exodus 12 meal or what Jews</text>
  <text start="340.19" dur="6.539">call the Seder as b14 ends is because I</text>
  <text start="343.909" dur="4.171">think that just most accurately fits the</text>
  <text start="346.729" dur="4.651">scriptural model of what we&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="348.08" dur="5.01">to do to celebrate the fullness of</text>
  <text start="351.38" dur="4.409">Passover and what it what it actually</text>
  <text start="353.09" dur="5.22">means and again the most important thing</text>
  <text start="355.789" dur="3.66">about Passover and unleavened bread and</text>
  <text start="358.31" dur="3.69">then of course the feast of firstfruits</text>
  <text start="359.449" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;ll be it&amp;#39;s the morrow after the</text>
  <text start="362" dur="5.43">Sabbath within the seven days that will</text>
  <text start="363.529" dur="5.341">be on Sunday April 20th it&amp;#39;s always the</text>
  <text start="367.43" dur="2.13">Sunday that falls within the seven days</text>
  <text start="368.87" dur="4.5">of unleavened bread</text>
  <text start="369.56" dur="5.659">all of these feasts these high holy days</text>
  <text start="373.37" dur="6.15">that were going to be celebrating over</text>
  <text start="375.219" dur="5.531">this next week it all points to Yahshua</text>
  <text start="379.52" dur="7.23">it all paints a very beautiful picture</text>
  <text start="380.75" dur="8.699">of who Yahshua is what he did just you</text>
  <text start="386.75" dur="4.65">know it paints a very vivid picture of</text>
  <text start="389.449" dur="5.28">the death Brown resurrection of Yahshua</text>
  <text start="391.4" dur="5.79">and it does a much better job than the</text>
  <text start="394.729" dur="4.321">pagan Easter Ishtar and Good Friday</text>
  <text start="397.19" dur="3.63">which you know I know that there are</text>
  <text start="399.05" dur="2.55">Christian traditions but they have no</text>
  <text start="400.82" dur="3.12">roots in Scripture</text>
  <text start="401.6" dur="4.62">whatsoever so I encourage you if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="403.94" dur="3.81">never done a Passover to find friends</text>
  <text start="406.22" dur="4.17">and family or find a local Passover</text>
  <text start="407.75" dur="4.2">Seder in your town and go be a part of</text>
  <text start="410.39" dur="3.24">that because it&amp;#39;s not only a commandment</text>
  <text start="411.95" dur="2.73">but it brings us closer to Messiah</text>
  <text start="413.63" dur="3.03">Yahshua which is what all these</text>
