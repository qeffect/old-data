  <text start="6.24" dur="6.269">Toronto Canada Shalom Shalom I wanted to</text>
  <text start="9.42" dur="6.689">talk today just briefly about the</text>
  <text start="12.509" dur="6.151">example where Yahshua HaMashiach the</text>
  <text start="16.109" dur="4.411">Messiah Jesus Christ actually observe</text>
  <text start="18.66" dur="4.08">Sukkot the example of him observing in</text>
  <text start="20.52" dur="5.73">the scriptures if you go to John chapter</text>
  <text start="22.74" dur="5.85">7 and 8 you&amp;#39;re going to read about an</text>
  <text start="26.25" dur="5.64">example where Yahshua himself celebrates</text>
  <text start="28.59" dur="4.35">the coat in fact his brothers sort of</text>
  <text start="31.89" dur="2.28">make fun of him because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="32.94" dur="3.54">believe in them they don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="34.17" dur="4.2">really the Messiah and I say come on</text>
  <text start="36.48" dur="3.21">Josh whoa you&amp;#39;re going to go up to</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="3.54">Jerusalem and show yourself because they</text>
  <text start="39.69" dur="3.72">know that the leadership down in</text>
  <text start="41.91" dur="4.05">Jerusalem basically wants to kill</text>
  <text start="43.41" dur="4.559">Yahshua at this point and you know</text>
  <text start="45.96" dur="3.869">Yahshua says now you know you guys go up</text>
  <text start="47.969" dur="3.241">you know your time is already the world</text>
  <text start="49.829" dur="3.091">loves you because you&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="51.21" dur="3.48">living like the world but the world</text>
  <text start="52.92" dur="4.189">hates me because I testify if it&amp;#39;s worth</text>
  <text start="54.69" dur="5.49">that are evil so they go on up and</text>
  <text start="57.109" dur="4.481">Yahshua stays behind in northern Israel</text>
  <text start="60.18" dur="4.53">but then it says that right before</text>
  <text start="61.59" dur="5.849">Sukkot begins he in secret as it were</text>
  <text start="64.71" dur="5.01">goes up to the feast so y astral always</text>
  <text start="67.439" dur="4.051">obeys Torah and the Torah of course</text>
  <text start="69.72" dur="3.509">required that everyone would go up to</text>
  <text start="71.49" dur="3.09">Jerusalem for the feast of Sukkot</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="3.271">because that&amp;#39;s where Yahweh had placed</text>
  <text start="74.58" dur="4.469">his name the temple was there of course</text>
  <text start="76.5" dur="3.9">today in 2014 when we keep the Torah we</text>
  <text start="79.049" dur="3.18">don&amp;#39;t have to go to Jerusalem because</text>
  <text start="80.4" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s no temple there and there won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="82.229" dur="4.201">be a sanctified temple until yah show</text>
  <text start="84.39" dur="3.839">returns and rules and reigns from his</text>
  <text start="86.43" dur="4.29">throne of Jerusalem for a thousand years</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s a different story in any case</text>
  <text start="90.72" dur="4.35">Yahshua does eventually go up to</text>
  <text start="92.759" dur="4.231">Jerusalem right before Sukkot begins and</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="3.78">he&amp;#39;s there in secret sort of hiding and</text>
  <text start="96.99" dur="3.57">there&amp;#39;s all this murmuring going on</text>
  <text start="98.85" dur="3.089">during the Sukkot feast you know some</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="3.18">people are saying oh you know he is the</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="4.14">Messiah he&amp;#39;s the Messiah he&amp;#39;s the very</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="5.669">Christ others saying oh no he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="106.079" dur="5.07">deceiver he&amp;#39;s a liar and so we start</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="3.301">seeing how yah show begins to teach the</text>
  <text start="111.149" dur="2.97">people during the feast of Sukkot in</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="3.119">fact it says in the midst of the feast</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="3.151">which I assume would be probably day</text>
  <text start="115.829" dur="3.631">four or five you know like where we are</text>
  <text start="117.27" dur="4.529">right now right in the middle of the</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="3.72">eighth day piece of Sukkot he goes up to</text>
  <text start="121.799" dur="4.14">the tumbled out and he starts teaching</text>
  <text start="123.18" dur="4.59">he starts preaching and the amazing</text>
  <text start="125.939" dur="4.02">thing that happens is that there is like</text>
  <text start="127.77" dur="4.56">this division that begins to occur in</text>
  <text start="129.959" dur="3.731">fact by the last day of the feast which</text>
  <text start="132.33" dur="4.33">is called the last great day</text>
  <text start="133.69" dur="5.34">which is sort of like almost a sub feast</text>
  <text start="136.66" dur="4.44">or another feast that&amp;#39;s tacked onto the</text>
  <text start="139.03" dur="5.16">seven days that were in our sukas in our</text>
  <text start="141.1" dur="4.59">tents Yahshua he cries out at the top of</text>
  <text start="144.19" dur="3.24">his voice right in the middle of</text>
  <text start="145.69" dur="4.59">Jerusalem with all the crowds around he</text>
  <text start="147.43" dur="4.71">says I am the source of living waters</text>
  <text start="150.28" dur="3.78">whoever believes on me out of their</text>
  <text start="152.14" dur="3.48">belly will flow living waters and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.06" dur="3.66">you know talking about the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="155.62" dur="4.08">he refers to these waters because if</text>
  <text start="157.72" dur="3.53">you&amp;#39;re reading revelation 22 and like I</text>
  <text start="159.7" dur="5.67">referred yesterday at the Niagara Falls</text>
  <text start="161.25" dur="5.65">Sukkot teaching I did the fulfillment of</text>
  <text start="165.37" dur="3.81">the last great day the fulfillment of</text>
  <text start="166.9" dur="4.17">the feast of Sukkot it happens when</text>
  <text start="169.18" dur="3.6">those crystal waters of life are gushing</text>
  <text start="171.07" dur="3.48">out from the throne room of the Lamb and</text>
  <text start="172.78" dur="4.5">all the nations are able to be healed by</text>
  <text start="174.55" dur="5.49">those by those living waters and by the</text>
  <text start="177.28" dur="6.09">the twelve manner of fruit that&amp;#39;s born</text>
  <text start="180.04" dur="7.29">every month each of the twelve months in</text>
  <text start="183.37" dur="7.41">the new heavens and new earth yasha</text>
  <text start="187.33" dur="5.16">crisis out and the crowd some of them</text>
  <text start="190.78" dur="3.21">say oh you know this is the mushy Ock</text>
  <text start="192.49" dur="2.76">this is the Messiah this is the one</text>
  <text start="193.99" dur="3.27">we&amp;#39;ve been waiting for but than others</text>
  <text start="195.25" dur="3.63">and those who are being influenced by</text>
  <text start="197.26" dur="4.29">the Pharisees and the Sadducees in the</text>
  <text start="198.88" dur="4.8">leadership within jury there say oh no</text>
  <text start="201.55" dur="4.59">no he cannot possibly be the Messiah</text>
  <text start="203.68" dur="5.309">because the prophets and the tourist</text>
  <text start="206.14" dur="5.64">state very clearly that that the Messiah</text>
  <text start="208.989" dur="4.891">will come from Bethlehem now they were</text>
  <text start="211.78" dur="4.5">right I mean they knew their scriptures</text>
  <text start="213.88" dur="4.109">it&amp;#39;s very clear you go into the into the</text>
  <text start="216.28" dur="3.42">prophets and the Tanakh yes it does</text>
  <text start="217.989" dur="3.631">prophesied that the Messiah will come</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="3.6">from Bethlehem and will be from the line</text>
  <text start="221.62" dur="3.39">of David and they said well look he came</text>
  <text start="223.3" dur="3.659">from Nazareth his father was an address</text>
  <text start="225.01" dur="3.69">it was a carpenter of Nazareth his mom</text>
  <text start="226.959" dur="3.931">still lives in Nazareth with his family</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="4.65">he&amp;#39;s from Nazareth so he&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="230.89" dur="3.93">Messiah so they were right about the</text>
  <text start="233.35" dur="3.27">scriptures but they were wrong about</text>
  <text start="234.82" dur="3.27">Yasha because of course they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="236.62" dur="5.58">understand they didn&amp;#39;t know that Yahshua</text>
  <text start="238.09" dur="5.67">was born in Bethlehem many many years</text>
  <text start="242.2" dur="3.69">ago and no one knew about it because</text>
  <text start="243.76" dur="3.87">Joseph the Miriam were having to flee</text>
  <text start="245.89" dur="4.56">and go to Egypt to protect Yahshua from</text>
  <text start="247.63" dur="3.96">Herod so it&amp;#39;s like they had their facts</text>
  <text start="250.45" dur="3.18">right they had their head knowledge</text>
  <text start="251.59" dur="3.3">right they had the knowledge right but</text>
  <text start="253.63" dur="3.329">they totally missed it because their</text>
  <text start="254.89" dur="3.93">hearts were hard we never want to get to</text>
  <text start="256.959" dur="3.15">a point especially as we&amp;#39;re celebrating</text>
  <text start="258.82" dur="2.699">the feast of Sukkot where we have all</text>
  <text start="260.109" dur="3.541">this head not lunch we have all this</text>

  <text start="270.55" dur="3.75">get so head knowledge that our hearts</text>
  <text start="272.38" dur="3.33">have strayed far from him because the</text>
  <text start="274.3" dur="3.21">pharisees and sadducees they had head</text>
  <text start="275.71" dur="3.69">knowledge but their hearts were not in</text>
