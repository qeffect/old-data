  <text start="25.08" dur="3.75">just gradually zooming in on these</text>
  <text start="27.359" dur="3.84">timelines and becoming more more</text>
  <text start="28.83" dur="4.95">detailed in shorter spans of time so</text>
  <text start="31.199" dur="6.091">this next one that I&amp;#39;m doing is just</text>
  <text start="33.78" dur="6.17">centering on daniel&amp;#39;s 70th and final</text>
  <text start="37.29" dur="5.51">week so that final seven year period</text>
  <text start="39.95" dur="7.21">that&amp;#39;s mentioned in Daniel chapter 9</text>
  <text start="42.8" dur="7.509">specifically in verses 26 and 27 so</text>
  <text start="47.16" dur="6.66">Daniels final week which is of course a</text>
  <text start="50.309" dur="6.451">seven-year period so uh and again I will</text>
  <text start="53.82" dur="4.649">have this time line up on my website and</text>
  <text start="56.76" dur="3.24">i&amp;#39;ll provide a link for that below this</text>
  <text start="58.469" dur="5.191">video once i have it up so you can study</text>
  <text start="60" dur="7.17">that you&amp;#39;re at your leisure so after 69</text>
  <text start="63.66" dur="5.639">weeks of years 483 years from 470 bc</text>
  <text start="67.17" dur="3.809">this is the year that art exert sees the</text>
  <text start="69.299" dur="8.301">first issues the decree to rebuild</text>
  <text start="70.979" dur="12.901">jerusalem 213 ad that&amp;#39;s when 483 years</text>
  <text start="77.6" dur="8.29">have been completed you now come to 13</text>
  <text start="83.88" dur="4.23">ad and we&amp;#39;re going to come to the autumn</text>
  <text start="85.89" dur="6.36">the fall and this is when Yahshua is</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="5.76">going to begin begins his ministry</text>
  <text start="92.25" dur="3.87">and of course he has a ministry for</text>
  <text start="93.87" dur="7.05">three and a half years from the autumn</text>
  <text start="96.12" dur="7.97">of 1382 1480 1482 1580 1582 1680 and</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="6.059">then up to the spring Passover of 1780</text>
  <text start="104.09" dur="6.13">this is where Yahshua is cut off but not</text>
  <text start="106.979" dur="5.011">for himself as daniel 9 talks about the</text>
  <text start="110.22" dur="5.61">first three and a half years of Daniels</text>
  <text start="111.99" dur="6.54">70th week are now completed the 1780 is</text>
  <text start="115.83" dur="4.44">also a jubilee year and a major Middle</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="3.24">East earthquake is recorded by pliny</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="5.25">which I believe is the same earthquake</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="7.02">that erupts when Yahshua dies at his</text>
  <text start="125.52" dur="5.099">crucifixion so that&amp;#39;s the first three</text>
  <text start="128.79" dur="4.199">and a half years this is why again the</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="5.641">there seven years mentioned in the book</text>
  <text start="132.989" dur="4.771">of daniel for that last week but in</text>
  <text start="136.26" dur="3.9">Revelation there&amp;#39;s only a three and a</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="4.59">half year period mentioned because the</text>
  <text start="140.16" dur="5.61">first half of that seven years was</text>
  <text start="142.35" dur="6.48">fulfilled by the spring of 1780 so</text>
  <text start="145.77" dur="6.689">that&amp;#39;s the first the first half of</text>
  <text start="148.83" dur="7.2">Daniels 70th week then we have a two</text>
  <text start="152.459" dur="8.371">thousand year gap we have a 40 jubilee</text>
  <text start="156.03" dur="7.23">gap and I explain this why we have a 40</text>
  <text start="160.83" dur="4.83">jubilee gap in my video about Daniel&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="3.72">seventy weeks one thing I want to point</text>
  <text start="165.66" dur="3.45">out which I also point out in that of</text>
  <text start="166.98" dur="5.36">the video but I think it&amp;#39;s worthy of a</text>
  <text start="169.11" dur="6.12">second mention you have 40 Jubilees</text>
  <text start="172.34" dur="6.399">separating the first half of Daniels</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="6.15">70th week and the last half of Daniels</text>
  <text start="178.739" dur="6.271">70th week 40 Jubilees and then in that</text>
  <text start="181.38" dur="6.21">69 and a half weeks that you have from</text>
  <text start="185.01" dur="5.789">470 until 17 you got another ten</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="7.56">Jubilees so you got 10 and 40 so you</text>
  <text start="190.799" dur="5.851">have 50 Jubilees total in this in this</text>
  <text start="195.15" dur="5.13">time period from the beginning of</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="5.04">Daniels 70th week until the end 50</text>
  <text start="200.28" dur="3.36">Jubilees so I think that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="201.69" dur="5.28">significant because a jubilee happens</text>
  <text start="203.64" dur="5.24">every 50 years so 2017 is literally the</text>
  <text start="206.97" dur="4.04">50th jubilee</text>
  <text start="208.88" dur="5.4">annual 70 weeks so I think that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="211.01" dur="6.06">amazing so he goes at this forty Jubilee</text>
  <text start="214.28" dur="5.19">gap that separates the first three and a</text>
  <text start="217.07" dur="4.68">half years of Daniels 70th week and the</text>
  <text start="219.47" dur="5.22">last three and a half years of Daniels</text>
  <text start="221.75" dur="6.96">70th week so now we come to the spring</text>
  <text start="224.69" dur="5.91">of 2017 ad and it&amp;#39;s the great</text>
  <text start="228.71" dur="3.9">tribulation begins and it&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="230.6" dur="4.08">jubilee year again keep in mind the</text>
  <text start="232.61" dur="4.74">mirror image that&amp;#39;s embedded in this</text>
  <text start="234.68" dur="4.47">seventh and final week you&amp;#39;ve got the</text>
  <text start="237.35" dur="4.77">spring here and you&amp;#39;ve got the spring</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="6.81">reflected here you got a jubilee hear</text>
  <text start="242.12" dur="6.33">you got a jubilee here it ends in autumn</text>
  <text start="245.96" dur="5.19">here begins an autumn up here so you</text>
  <text start="248.45" dur="4.67">have a lot of a lot of reflections here</text>
  <text start="251.15" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s a mirror image it&amp;#39;s pretty neat</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="4.089">so now we have the three and a half year</text>
  <text start="255.41" dur="3.99">Great Tribulation Period that is</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="5.281">mentioned in the book of Revelation in</text>
  <text start="259.4" dur="4.91">several different instances mentioned as</text>
  <text start="262.49" dur="5.09">three and a half years as mentioned as</text>
  <text start="264.31" dur="6.67">42 months it&amp;#39;s mentioned as 1260 days</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="4.9">but it all means the same thing and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.98" dur="5.01">a three and a half year period to finish</text>
  <text start="272.48" dur="5.7">out that that seven year seven year</text>
  <text start="275.99" dur="4.58">period of the last week so the Great</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="5.58">Tribulation starts in the spring of 2017</text>
  <text start="280.57" dur="5.86">to the spring of 2018 to the spring of</text>
  <text start="283.76" dur="4.77">2019 and then stretches all the way to</text>
  <text start="286.43" dur="4.08">the autumn of twenty20 to make three and</text>
  <text start="288.53" dur="4.38">a half years this is when Yahshua</text>
  <text start="290.51" dur="5.7">returns the last three and a half years</text>
  <text start="292.91" dur="6.09">of Daniels 70th week are completed one</text>
  <text start="296.21" dur="6.33">thing interesting since 2017 is a</text>
  <text start="299" dur="7.23">jubilee year that means 2018 is a first</text>
  <text start="302.54" dur="6.48">year in the next cycle 2019 as a second</text>
  <text start="306.23" dur="5.01">year in 2020 is a third year of the next</text>
  <text start="309.02" dur="4.5">seven year cycle and what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="311.24" dur="5.19">about that is there&amp;#39;s a scripture in</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="4.65">Hosea where it says were hurt for two</text>
  <text start="316.43" dur="3.99">days and then he binds up our wombs in</text>
  <text start="318.17" dur="3.93">the third day so the fact that he comes</text>
  <text start="320.42" dur="3.93">in the third year of a seven-year cycle</text>
  <text start="322.1" dur="3.78">i think is very significant and i&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="324.35" dur="3.87">if you search the Scriptures you can</text>
  <text start="325.88" dur="5.55">find many references to the third day</text>
  <text start="328.22" dur="6.06">being the day that is very significant</text>
  <text start="331.43" dur="5.07">course yasha was buried in the grave</text>
  <text start="334.28" dur="3.449">just like Jonah&amp;#39;s in the in the belly of</text>
  <text start="336.5" dur="4.56">the well for three nights and three days</text>
  <text start="337.729" dur="4.651">and Rises just after the third day so I</text>
  <text start="341.06" dur="3.09">think you can find probably a lot of</text>
  <text start="342.38" dur="6.03">significance to him coming in the third</text>
  <text start="344.15" dur="10.68">year of a seven-year cycle incidentally</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="7.92">1380 so this is this was a jubilee so if</text>
  <text start="354.83" dur="5.399">we count backwards this was the seventh</text>
  <text start="356.33" dur="6.899">year six year fifth year and this is now</text>
  <text start="360.229" dur="5.791">the fourth year so he starts in the</text>
  <text start="363.229" dur="4.801">fourth year of a seven-year cycle which</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="3.06">is interesting because Yahshua was born</text>
  <text start="368.03" dur="4.139">right at the end of the fourth</text>
  <text start="369.08" dur="5.13">millennium and the number four is all</text>
  <text start="372.169" dur="3.661">often tied to the Israel of course</text>
  <text start="374.21" dur="4.86">Yahshua came to minister to the lost</text>
  <text start="375.83" dur="6.24">sheep of Israel not really to the</text>
  <text start="379.07" dur="4.5">Gentiles but to Israel primarily so</text>
  <text start="382.07" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s a lot of interesting things with</text>
  <text start="383.57" dur="5.31">the numbers that you can kind of glean</text>
  <text start="385.91" dur="5.55">out of this final week of Daniel again</text>
  <text start="388.88" dur="5.34">just to reiterate I do believe that</text>
  <text start="391.46" dur="5.37">Daniels 70th and final week a seven-year</text>
  <text start="394.22" dur="4.56">period is split down the middle by a two</text>
  <text start="396.83" dur="3.66">thousand year for to Jubilee gap and</text>
  <text start="398.78" dur="3.27">that you have the first three and a half</text>
  <text start="400.49" dur="3.84">years fulfilled in his ministry and the</text>
  <text start="402.05" dur="4.51">Gospels and the last year now here&amp;#39;s is</text>
  <text start="404.33" dur="6.73">a filled in the Great Tribulation that</text>
  <text start="406.56" dur="6.06">not yet we got so I hope this is a</text>
  <text start="411.06" dur="3.48">minister&amp;#39;s to you like i said i will put</text>
  <text start="412.62" dur="3.24">this up on the website and then put a</text>
  <text start="414.54" dur="3.21">link below this video when i get that</text>
