  <text start="8.91" dur="4.559">mother because they have gone through</text>
  <text start="11.04" dur="4.62">just an absolutely horrific experience</text>
  <text start="13.469" dur="6.57">over the last several years really over</text>
  <text start="15.66" dur="8.22">the last decade sara has had four of her</text>
  <text start="20.039" dur="6.391">children stolen from her by the arizona</text>

  <text start="26.43" dur="4.2">course I&amp;#39;ve you know I&amp;#39;ve made a big</text>
  <text start="28.26" dur="4.2">deal on my channel particularly over the</text>
  <text start="30.63" dur="5.339">last several months about just the</text>
  <text start="32.46" dur="5.279">horrible abuses that CPS has done not</text>
  <text start="35.969" dur="6.301">just in Arizona but across the United</text>
  <text start="37.739" dur="6.991">States and really Sara&amp;#39;s children you</text>
  <text start="42.27" dur="4.98">know the last three that were taken from</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="4.349">her really were taken because of what</text>
  <text start="47.25" dur="4.649">happened with their first child so Sara</text>
  <text start="49.079" dur="5.611">I&amp;#39;d like you to just sort of start off</text>
  <text start="51.899" dur="5.461">from the very very beginning with your</text>
  <text start="54.69" dur="6.75">first child Isaiah and just tell us</text>
  <text start="57.36" dur="8.63">exactly what happened and how CPS got</text>
  <text start="61.44" dur="8.82">involved okay so the first with Isaiah I</text>
  <text start="65.99" dur="16.09">remember going into labor I think I</text>
  <text start="70.26" dur="16.14">believe I went into labor I went to</text>
  <text start="82.08" dur="7.95">Arrowhead hospital and my OBGYN was dr.</text>
  <text start="86.4" dur="9.21">Jenkins and she was the same OBGYN that</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="8.07">my sister had and I was there for about</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="6.03">three days they were pumping me with</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="6.21">pitocin to increase my labor and at the</text>
  <text start="101.64" dur="6.03">same time they were pumping me with</text>
  <text start="104.31" dur="5.97">another type of medication I&amp;#39;m not sure</text>
  <text start="107.67" dur="5.61">maybe mom knows what it is but to stop</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="7.799">my labor at the same time and I remember</text>
  <text start="113.28" dur="9.93">being on the the the table or the you</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="8.461">know the delivery seat begging and</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="5.749">pleading for a c-section and I was</text>
  <text start="126.54" dur="6.89">blacking out and there were my doctor</text>
  <text start="128.959" dur="7.571">she left while I was in the middle</text>
  <text start="133.43" dur="4.809">giving birth to Isaiah she left and went</text>
  <text start="136.53" dur="8.97">to banner Thunderbird to deliver another</text>
  <text start="138.239" dur="9.691">child so after well actually Sarah was</text>
  <text start="145.5" dur="6.09">admitted to the hospital on March 24th</text>
  <text start="147.93" dur="8.779">of 2008 and the doctor actually induced</text>
  <text start="151.59" dur="9.209">her labor no the doctors her labor and</text>
  <text start="156.709" dur="10.661">in the interim there she was getting her</text>
  <text start="160.799" dur="10.08">Tosun to accelerate her labor after dr.</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="5.929">Don Jenkins left the hospital to go</text>
  <text start="170.879" dur="5.01">deliver another baby at another hospital</text>
  <text start="173.299" dur="6.36">when she was delayed in getting back to</text>
  <text start="175.889" dur="7.291">deliver Isaiah she ordered the the</text>
  <text start="179.659" dur="5.41">medication to Bernie I don&amp;#39;t know to</text>
  <text start="183.18" dur="5.88">Birla teen or something like that to</text>
  <text start="185.069" dur="6.42">stop her labor so I even though Sarah</text>
  <text start="189.06" dur="4.799">wintered the hospital like at 2:30 in</text>
  <text start="191.489" dur="5.101">the afternoon on the 24th of March</text>
  <text start="193.859" dur="7.47">Isaiah wasn&amp;#39;t actually delivered by</text>
  <text start="196.59" dur="7.88">c-section no it was the 20 there was the</text>
  <text start="201.329" dur="5.88">23rd was it was my scheduled date okay</text>
  <text start="204.47" dur="6.31">Isaiah wasn&amp;#39;t actually delivered until</text>
  <text start="207.209" dur="7.201">like almost 3:00 a.m. on the 26th so she</text>
  <text start="210.78" dur="4.47">was in a waiver for really an extended</text>
  <text start="214.41" dur="9.99">period of time</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="11.76">yeah and then when Isaiah came out he</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="7.799">was delivered by c-section and he had</text>
  <text start="227.01" dur="10.68">this extremely distorted head that was</text>
  <text start="232.199" dur="9.57">look like and he was purple blue you</text>
  <text start="237.69" dur="7.919">name it he had the cord wrapped around</text>
  <text start="241.769" dur="6.72">his neck twice so there was lack of</text>
  <text start="245.609" dur="7.921">oxygen to his brain he autumn he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="248.489" dur="7.411">he he was put on a flight right to go to</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="5.609">Phoenix Children&amp;#39;s yeah I think it was a</text>
  <text start="255.9" dur="7.8">flight to Phoenix Children&amp;#39;s Hospital</text>
  <text start="259.139" dur="7.381">and he was put in the the NICU</text>
  <text start="263.7" dur="3.4">I wasn&amp;#39;t able to touch him I wasn&amp;#39;t able</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="3.85">to have</text>
  <text start="267.1" dur="6.66">any physical contact no he went from</text>
  <text start="270.37" dur="7.35">Arrowhead hospital to Danner Thunderbird</text>
  <text start="273.76" dur="7.44">and the man a Thunderbird did not have</text>
  <text start="277.72" dur="5.31">the facilities to take care of him</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="3.96">so he was transferred to Phoenix</text>
  <text start="283.03" dur="4.98">Children&amp;#39;s Hospital but the important</text>
  <text start="285.16" dur="6.6">thing to note is that when dr. Jenkins</text>
  <text start="288.01" dur="6.54">knew yes you know she knew that she had</text>
  <text start="291.76" dur="5.01">committed medical malpractice she did</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="5.94">she immediately within seven hours</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="5.7">called a social worker because all the</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="3.75">hospitals have social workers so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.47" dur="4.05">let&amp;#39;s stop right here so the malpractice</text>
  <text start="304.24" dur="5.67">is because I&amp;#39;ve heard of you know</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="7.14">women&amp;#39;s labor is being induced by what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.91" dur="6.66">what&amp;#39;s it called pitocin Kosan I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="313.66" dur="4.11">heard that which I know is is is not a</text>
  <text start="316.57" dur="3.21">good thing to do but I&amp;#39;ve heard have</text>
  <text start="317.77" dur="5.51">done but then it sounds like then she</text>
  <text start="319.78" dur="6.99">gave gave your daughter</text>
  <text start="323.28" dur="6.94">another medication to then delay the</text>
  <text start="326.77" dur="5.82">labor yes the same exact time to stop</text>
  <text start="330.22" dur="3.63">the labor and why did she do that</text>
  <text start="332.59" dur="4.98">what was her reasoning for doing because</text>
  <text start="333.85" dur="5.88">I&amp;#39;ve never heard that being done well we</text>
  <text start="337.57" dur="6.5">didn&amp;#39;t know about that until we athle</text>
  <text start="339.73" dur="4.34">got the medical records</text>
  <text start="347.82" dur="9.1">yeah it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="350.64" dur="9.16">turbulence sulfates and pitocin is a</text>
  <text start="356.92" dur="5.72">really dangerous drug both to the</text>
  <text start="359.8" dur="5.31">mothers and the unborn child right</text>
  <text start="362.64" dur="5.05">because it has a lot of side effects</text>
  <text start="365.11" dur="5.67">like retinal hemorrhage cerebral</text>
  <text start="367.69" dur="6.66">hemorrhage neonatal jaundice brain</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="7.41">damage including hypoxic ischemic</text>
  <text start="374.35" dur="7.77">encephalopathy it can even cause</text>
  <text start="378.19" dur="8.01">neonatal surgeries seizures and death</text>
  <text start="382.12" dur="7.83">so eventually Isaiah was diagnosed after</text>
  <text start="386.2" dur="6.03">several several doctors and several</text>
  <text start="389.95" dur="7.78">tests eventually he was diagnosed with</text>
  <text start="392.23" dur="8.56">cerebral palsy and and the hypoxic</text>
  <text start="397.73" dur="5.43">well because the doctor decided for</text>
  <text start="400.79" dur="4.47">Hospital and attained maybe rather than</text>
  <text start="403.16" dur="4.02">just stay there for the delivery and so</text>
  <text start="405.26" dur="4.41">she was administering you know these</text>
  <text start="407.18" dur="5.34">medications that obviously complicated</text>
  <text start="409.67" dur="4.65">the birth yeah which now that you</text>
  <text start="412.52" dur="3.42">actually put it that way I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="414.32" dur="4.41">that she was maybe she was probably sign</text>
  <text start="415.94" dur="7.35">trying to delay my labor because she</text>
  <text start="418.73" dur="7.11">left maybe Wow okay so that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="423.29" dur="5.7">that&amp;#39;s where the the medical malpractice</text>
  <text start="425.84" dur="5.85">cover-up started and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="428.99" dur="5.94">actually Arizona Child Protective</text>
  <text start="431.69" dur="12.42">Services started tracking Isaiah and</text>
  <text start="434.93" dur="10.92">Sarah yeah yeah okay so after this</text>
  <text start="444.11" dur="4.44">incident happened where he was born how</text>
  <text start="445.85" dur="7.7">much longer then did it take for CPS to</text>
  <text start="448.55" dur="5">actually take Isaiah from from you sir</text>
  <text start="453.79" dur="10">he was he was 14 months old yeah about a</text>
  <text start="461.21" dur="4.95">year during the sorry mom&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="463.79" dur="5.25">going off of like notes on her computer</text>
  <text start="466.16" dur="8.34">and making me lose focus of what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="469.04" dur="9.81">trying to say but technically since</text>
  <text start="474.5" dur="7.47">Isaiah was Batman or Thunderbird was</text>
  <text start="478.85" dur="4.77">when the CPS technically got involved</text>
  <text start="481.97" dur="4.92">and then at Phoenix Children&amp;#39;s Hospital</text>
  <text start="483.62" dur="5.96">because another soldier came in while I</text>
  <text start="486.89" dur="5.55">was visiting with my son in the room</text>
  <text start="489.58" dur="8.02">okay and what what was the reasoning of</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="10.77">why they got involved initially dr.</text>
  <text start="497.6" dur="7.95">Jenkins it was no dr. Jenkins contacted</text>
  <text start="503.21" dur="6.06">the social worker at the hospital where</text>
  <text start="505.55" dur="6.42">Isaiah was born to provide Sarah with</text>
  <text start="509.27" dur="4.74">what she called emotional support yeah</text>
  <text start="511.97" dur="5.94">but that was such that was just such a</text>
  <text start="514.01" dur="9.71">wide I mean the the original allegation</text>
  <text start="517.91" dur="8.82">that I remember was medical neglect</text>
  <text start="523.72" dur="6.52">yeah they charged Sarah CPS charged</text>
  <text start="526.73" dur="4.35">Sarah with medical neglect when he was</text>
  <text start="530.24" dur="2.94">acting</text>
  <text start="531.08" dur="5.31">it was actually the doctors yeah and the</text>
  <text start="533.18" dur="7.38">hospital that did the medical neglect</text>
  <text start="536.39" dur="5.43">because he was left in in in this room</text>
  <text start="540.56" dur="3.96">for too long</text>
  <text start="541.82" dur="4.55">he went into distress he had oxygen</text>
  <text start="544.52" dur="8.1">deprivation and he was ultimately</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="10.21">diagnosed I remember apologizing I was</text>
  <text start="552.62" dur="8.13">apologizing to the staff and begging for</text>
  <text start="556.58" dur="5.73">a c-section I mean they left me like to</text>
  <text start="560.75" dur="6.18">fend for it felt like they left me to</text>
  <text start="562.31" dur="7.29">fend for myself yeah I mean so they they</text>
  <text start="566.93" dur="5.1">they were being duplicate old you well</text>
  <text start="569.6" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re sending you a social worker for</text>
  <text start="572.03" dur="5.69">for emotional comfort but in fact they</text>
  <text start="574.25" dur="5.85">were trying to argue with with neglect</text>
  <text start="577.72" dur="3.7">when really it was the the medical</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="7.08">malpractice that led to all these</text>
  <text start="581.42" dur="9.27">problems with Isaiah okay all right so</text>
  <text start="587.18" dur="5.91">let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s skip ahead then to the 14</text>
  <text start="590.69" dur="6.57">months later when they took Isaiah from</text>
  <text start="593.09" dur="5.97">you what what what did they say they</text>
  <text start="597.26" dur="4.29">just said well you know we think that</text>
  <text start="599.06" dur="10.5">he&amp;#39;s not safe with you or what what was</text>
  <text start="601.55" dur="11.91">the reasoning well they they touched her</text>
  <text start="609.56" dur="7.62">they made they the allegations were that</text>
  <text start="613.46" dur="5.37">Sarah medically neglected Isaiah she</text>
  <text start="617.18" dur="4.89">wasn&amp;#39;t taking him to the doctor or</text>
  <text start="618.83" dur="7.53">anything but okay so Isaiah had to</text>
  <text start="622.07" dur="5.64">pediatricians twin pediatrics the Jamal</text>
  <text start="626.36" dur="3.33">clan brothers which were my</text>
  <text start="627.71" dur="5.97">pediatricians when I was growing up and</text>
  <text start="629.69" dur="6.66">then he had I&amp;#39;m not sure of the name he</text>
  <text start="633.68" dur="6.45">had another set of pediatrician um you</text>
  <text start="636.35" dur="6.78">know cuz I wanted I wanted another</text>
  <text start="640.13" dur="5.22">opinion a second opinion he also went to</text>
  <text start="643.13" dur="8.76">the countess clinic and then he went to</text>
  <text start="645.35" dur="10.38">see a dr. Spiegel at Cigna and then he</text>
  <text start="651.89" dur="7.62">had two neurologists dr. Tiye Dorie and</text>
  <text start="655.73" dur="6.15">dr. was a Chapman yeah dr. Janet Chidori</text>
  <text start="659.51" dur="5.01">was actually a neurologist at Phoenix</text>
  <text start="661.88" dur="6.3">Children&amp;#39;s Hospital and dr. Kevin</text>
  <text start="664.52" dur="6">man was Isaiah&amp;#39;s neurologist at Barrow</text>
  <text start="668.18" dur="6.93">Neurological Institute which is a really</text>
  <text start="670.52" dur="8.52">renowned Institute and they determined</text>
  <text start="675.11" dur="7.8">that Isaiah only suffered seizures on</text>
  <text start="679.04" dur="8.28">day 1 of life which was probably due to</text>
  <text start="682.91" dur="8.3">the pitocin and the terbutaline or</text>
  <text start="687.32" dur="5.82">whatever they stopped Sarah&amp;#39;s labor</text>
  <text start="691.21" dur="4.87">because he was on anti-seizure</text>
  <text start="693.14" dur="4.59">medication for a while yeah but then</text>
  <text start="696.08" dur="4.47">they realized that he wasn&amp;#39;t having any</text>
  <text start="697.73" dur="5.67">more seizures and so we finally took him</text>
  <text start="700.55" dur="6.02">to a different pediatrician who actually</text>
  <text start="703.4" dur="6.87">diagnosed him with the cerebral palsy</text>
  <text start="706.57" dur="6.07">okay so the point is Sarah is obviously</text>
  <text start="710.27" dur="7.38">being very diligent and making sure that</text>
  <text start="712.64" dur="7.53">Isaiah has plenty of medical care she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="717.65" dur="5.22">not being negligent in any way and yet</text>
  <text start="720.17" dur="5.67">c/s is saying oh she&amp;#39;s being negligent</text>
  <text start="722.87" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;re gonna take him from her well the</text>
  <text start="725.84" dur="3.9">other thing is too is that the doctors</text>
  <text start="727.94" dur="3.36">before they really knew what was wrong</text>
  <text start="729.74" dur="5.28">with him they really they thought he was</text>
  <text start="731.3" dur="6.84">blind right and so as soon as he was</text>
  <text start="735.02" dur="5.76">born and we knew that there was some</text>
  <text start="738.14" dur="5.6">medical issues we enrolled him in the</text>
  <text start="740.78" dur="5.76">Arizona early intervention program and</text>
  <text start="743.74" dur="5.02">immediately got him involved with the</text>
  <text start="746.54" dur="7.23">division of developmental disabilities</text>
  <text start="748.76" dur="7.68">and after he was diagnosed we with</text>
  <text start="753.77" dur="7.47">cerebral palsy we applied for Social</text>
  <text start="756.44" dur="8.37">Security disability for him and so he</text>
  <text start="761.24" dur="5.49">was getting therapy from the Foundation</text>
  <text start="764.81" dur="6.18">for the blind because and this was like</text>
  <text start="766.73" dur="8.58">every week and then we had Healthy</text>
  <text start="770.99" dur="7.08">Families coming in once a week into our</text>
  <text start="775.31" dur="7.23">home to check on him now</text>
  <text start="778.07" dur="7.17">the other thing that is when this</text>
  <text start="782.54" dur="6.57">started and they took Isaiah and said</text>
  <text start="785.24" dur="7.05">that Isaiah wasn&amp;#39;t safe in our home</text>
  <text start="789.11" dur="5.19">my Sarah&amp;#39;s 13 year old brother and her</text>
  <text start="792.29" dur="4.8">brother lived there he was 13 at the</text>
  <text start="794.3" dur="4.01">time am i two three-year-old</text>
  <text start="797.09" dur="3.68">granddaughters</text>
  <text start="798.31" dur="6.15">so live there with their mothers my</text>
  <text start="800.77" dur="6.69">other two daughters so I find it really</text>
  <text start="804.46" dur="5.42">ironic that CPS said that Isaiah was the</text>
  <text start="807.46" dur="11.01">only child that wasn&amp;#39;t safe in the home</text>
  <text start="809.88" dur="13.89">yes you know yeah so in we realized</text>
  <text start="818.47" dur="9.2">after the case was done that we got</text>
  <text start="823.77" dur="9.19">several we requested the CPS records</text>
