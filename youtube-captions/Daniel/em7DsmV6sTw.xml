  <text start="11.19" dur="5.31">where Ruth who was above it√≠s is grafted</text>
  <text start="13.95" dur="6.989">into Israel because she holds on to her</text>
  <text start="16.5" dur="6.269">on goes on to her mother-in-law Naomi</text>

  <text start="108.43" dur="5.5">Samuels who&amp;#39;s the last judge we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="112.49" dur="3.36">introduced to push to David who is</text>
  <text start="113.93" dur="5.07">considered both the king and prophet or</text>

  <text start="122.36" dur="5.88">and will always tell us the truth hmm</text>
  <text start="125.03" dur="7.32">and of course David and Samuel both of</text>
  <text start="128.24" dur="6.09">those characters in many ways reflects</text>
  <text start="132.35" dur="3.84">different aspects of who the Messiah is</text>
  <text start="134.33" dur="9.18">an hour for shadows of who the Messiah</text>
  <text start="136.19" dur="8.73">will be in kings and in chronicles so</text>
