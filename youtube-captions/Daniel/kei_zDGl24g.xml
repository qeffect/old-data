  <text start="0.02" dur="5.71">Shalom Shalom Shalom I&amp;#39;m sitting here in</text>
  <text start="2.85" dur="6.66">my car at PSU because it&amp;#39;s raining</text>
  <text start="5.73" dur="7.92">outside I just finished a a two hour</text>
  <text start="9.51" dur="6.869">stint of street preacher at Portland</text>
  <text start="13.65" dur="5.61">State University God got out there</text>
  <text start="16.379" dur="5.73">little after noon and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure</text>
  <text start="19.26" dur="4.019">for a good good solid two hours more</text>
  <text start="22.109" dur="4.561">than two hours actually because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="23.279" dur="5.551">almost it&amp;#39;s almost two-thirty here so I</text>
  <text start="26.67" dur="3.689">took out my umbrella and actually I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="28.83" dur="6.24">now gonna have to buy a new umbrella</text>
  <text start="30.359" dur="6.331">because my my umbrella got mangled took</text>
  <text start="35.07" dur="3.059">my umbrella has started preaching around</text>
  <text start="36.69" dur="4.02">noon there was hardly anyone out because</text>
  <text start="38.129" dur="5.881">it was raining and yet as i began to</text>
  <text start="40.71" dur="5.369">exalt the torah and Yahshua really</text>
  <text start="44.01" dur="4.11">emphasizing the blood atonement a crowd</text>
  <text start="46.079" dur="4.831">started to form amazingly even in the</text>
  <text start="48.12" dur="5.669">rain and then for there&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="50.91" dur="4.26">of time of the rain stopped but one of</text>
  <text start="53.789" dur="4.471">the reasons why a crowd developed was</text>
  <text start="55.17" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s this man named joshua and he was</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="4.47">a very wicked man he he professed with</text>
  <text start="60.42" dur="4.8">his lips that he loves Christ and yet he</text>
  <text start="62.73" dur="6.03">said that he lied every single day he</text>
  <text start="65.22" dur="6.75">lies and very smug and arrogant attitude</text>
  <text start="68.76" dur="5.85">very wicked and so what happened was is</text>
  <text start="71.97" dur="5.13">that as I was exalting the true Christ</text>
  <text start="74.61" dur="5.13">the true Yahshua one who loves ya xuan</text>
  <text start="77.1" dur="4.62">will not send one who will truly obey</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="3.9">the entire Torah hat of love Rio shua</text>
  <text start="81.72" dur="4.14">what happened was is the spirit of yah</text>
  <text start="83.64" dur="4.47">began to just show this diametric</text>
  <text start="85.86" dur="8.6">difference between me and this very</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="8.64">wicked arrogant smug hypocrite Joshua</text>
  <text start="94.46" dur="4.659">eventually when I was preaching on</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="4.11">Hebrews chapter 8 and the essence of the</text>
  <text start="99.119" dur="2.971">gospel Joshua started saying oh that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="100.86" dur="2.67">not what it says that&amp;#39;s not what it says</text>
  <text start="102.09" dur="3.809">and of course then I actually opened the</text>
  <text start="103.53" dur="3.629">Bible and read it verbatim even at that</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="3.631">point he&amp;#39;s still hardened his heart and</text>
  <text start="107.159" dur="4.051">so at that point I decided to read first</text>
  <text start="109.53" dur="3.81">Corinthians 5 and I delivered him over</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="3.869">to Satan and i prophesied to him I said</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="3.87">that within five months your life will</text>
  <text start="115.079" dur="3.33">be a complete wreck and he said well</text>
  <text start="117.21" dur="3">give me your phone number so that I can</text>
  <text start="118.409" dur="4.261">call you when that happens nice okay so</text>
  <text start="120.21" dur="3.93">I gave him my phone number and then I</text>
  <text start="122.67" dur="3.299">noticed even after I continued to preach</text>
  <text start="124.14" dur="4.05">he would go like a snake to like</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="4.501">different members of my crowd and start</text>
  <text start="128.19" dur="4.74">you know speaking wickedness to them and</text>
  <text start="130.47" dur="4.41">but that was fine so I preached on that</text>
  <text start="132.93" dur="3.81">and then so a lot of it was it was</text>
  <text start="134.88" dur="3.99">dealing with and of course because he</text>
  <text start="136.74" dur="5.4">came out a lot of people were came out</text>
  <text start="138.87" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re hypocrites and then there was also</text>
  <text start="142.14" dur="3.93">this very proud atheist that I was</text>
  <text start="144" dur="3.69">debating the Roche limit you know and</text>
  <text start="146.07" dur="5.58">the age of the earth and evolution and</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="5.28">he was very wicked as well but then the</text>
  <text start="151.65" dur="3.6">Spirit of God just let me to start</text>
  <text start="152.97" dur="6.84">preaching out psalm 119 and I did that</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="6.39">and just continue to emphasize what a</text>
  <text start="159.81" dur="4.53">true believer does that a true believer</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="5.58">the essence of the gospel is that you</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="6">have an inward desire to obey the Torah</text>
  <text start="167.22" dur="6.239">and that really seemed to to quiet these</text>
  <text start="170.34" dur="4.56">hypocrites um there are several times of</text>
  <text start="173.459" dur="2.971">the Spirit I just overwhelmed me and I</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="4.02">was so grieved and I would just yell out</text>
  <text start="176.43" dur="4.35">because of my grief at these people who</text>
  <text start="178.92" dur="3.81">profess to love Christ and quote the</text>
  <text start="180.78" dur="3.65">Bible and yet they don&amp;#39;t have a clue who</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="3.81">Christ is because they still walk in sin</text>
  <text start="184.43" dur="3.94">even in the midst of that though I had</text>
  <text start="186.54" dur="3.21">several people ask for cards I mean</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="4.32">literally who came up to me and wanted a</text>
  <text start="189.75" dur="5.19">card I had one lady young woman who said</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="3.57">look I heard you&amp;#39;re a pastor of a</text>
  <text start="194.94" dur="2.88">congregation I want to be a part of it</text>
  <text start="196.26" dur="3.24">so I gave her my information she&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="197.82" dur="3.15">to join our skype meetings so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="3.38">already gotten a student at PSU who</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="4.26">wants to join our nightly Skype meetings</text>
  <text start="202.88" dur="4.06">and there were a couple of others who</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="4.11">just you don&amp;#39;t ask for a website there</text>
  <text start="206.94" dur="3.99">was another guy I talked to that was</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="3.99">also interested enjoying the skype and</text>
  <text start="210.93" dur="3.96">he grabbed my card so that was really</text>
  <text start="213.33" dur="7.02">neat that&amp;#39;s the first time that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.89" dur="6.75">happened um and um at one point the most</text>
  <text start="220.35" dur="4.5">controversial point was there was a</text>
  <text start="221.64" dur="4.92">woman who was a Jew and she was trying</text>
  <text start="224.85" dur="3.57">to quote the Bible to me and I said</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="4.489">where your zeit zeit where&amp;#39;s your head</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="5.4">covering where you know and and and I</text>
  <text start="231.049" dur="5.051">called her a bitch I called her a bitch</text>
  <text start="233.82" dur="4.02">and people got really upset about that</text>
  <text start="236.1" dur="3.859">but then I said wait a minute do you</text>
  <text start="237.84" dur="5.64">remember when Jesus Christ called um</text>
  <text start="239.959" dur="6.701">that came a night woman a dog you know</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="5.67">she said he said I&amp;#39;ve come not to to</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="4.74">serve the Gentile dogs i&amp;#39;m going to the</text>
  <text start="249.15" dur="5.22">jews and then she rather than getting</text>
  <text start="251.4" dur="5.309">offended she responded in humility and</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="4.14">said yes but jesus even the dogs can eat</text>
  <text start="256.709" dur="4.051">the crumb the crumbs at the master&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="3.59">table so she was not offended that jesus</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="3.11">called her a bitch and</text>
  <text start="262.1" dur="4.05">unfortunately when I called this woman a</text>
  <text start="263.87" dur="3.57">bit she was very offended but if she had</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="6.06">responded in humility she would have</text>
  <text start="267.44" dur="6.21">been blessed um so that that caused a</text>
  <text start="272.21" dur="3.27">lot of controversy but it&amp;#39;s still it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="273.65" dur="3.72">still droopy people&amp;#39;s that the pure</text>
  <text start="275.48" dur="3.69">hearts were not offended and there were</text>
