  <text start="541.32" dur="4.14">sea of fire and glass in which then</text>
  <text start="543.93" dur="2.94">rabbi shul talks about this where we</text>
  <text start="545.46" dur="3.6">stand before the judgment seat of christ</text>
  <text start="546.87" dur="3.78">and he gives us our rewards and some of</text>
  <text start="549.06" dur="3.21">us only have a wooden stubble and some</text>
  <text start="550.65" dur="5.04">of us that I talked about this last</text>

  <text start="555.69" dur="6.48">represented here and Yom Kippur you got</text>
  <text start="558.87" dur="5.46">represented here in the labor okay and</text>
  <text start="562.17" dur="6.24">they always had to go through this in</text>
  <text start="564.33" dur="5.58">order to get into the holy place these</text>
  <text start="568.41" dur="2.64">other items too are really interested to</text>
  <text start="569.91" dur="3.15">talk about I&amp;#39;m not going to really</text>
  <text start="571.05" dur="3.6">highlight them much but you know we have</text>
  <text start="573.06" dur="3.18">the menorah which represents the light</text>
  <text start="574.65" dur="3.84">of the world represents Christ but</text>
  <text start="576.24" dur="3.66">there&amp;#39;s a lot of layers to the menorah I</text>
  <text start="578.49" dur="4.02">mean there&amp;#39;s the seven spirits of yah</text>
  <text start="579.9" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s this a ton of things</text>
  <text start="582.51" dur="4.92">that are related to the menorah the</text>
  <text start="584.82" dur="3.93">seven assemblies in Revelation yeah</text>
  <text start="587.43" dur="3.06">there&amp;#39;s just anyway</text>
  <text start="588.75" dur="3.03">they kept this for petrol it and then</text>
  <text start="590.49" dur="4.02">over here we have the table to show</text>
  <text start="591.78" dur="5.64">bread okay which represented every tribe</text>
  <text start="594.51" dur="5.19">of Israel twelve means apostolic</text>
  <text start="597.42" dur="5.79">authority that was the table of</text>
  <text start="599.7" dur="6.9">showbread they would always be baked and</text>
  <text start="603.21" dur="5.91">hot everyday and then we have the altar</text>
  <text start="606.6" dur="4.77">of incense which would create sort of a</text>
  <text start="609.12" dur="4.23">cloud it was where the drink offerings</text>
  <text start="611.37" dur="3.72">were gone the incense offerings that was</text>
  <text start="613.35" dur="3.71">before this curtain that separated the</text>
  <text start="615.09" dur="4.53">holy place from the most holy place and</text>
  <text start="617.06" dur="5.86">again no blood was put on this altar it</text>
  <text start="619.62" dur="5.76">was all drink offerings and incense and</text>
  <text start="622.92" dur="4.98">this just represents the the perfume and</text>
  <text start="625.38" dur="4.26">the beauty of worship unto yo you know</text>
  <text start="627.9" dur="3.3">what you you got to go through Passover</text>
  <text start="629.64" dur="3.03">and get that blood sacrifice and you got</text>
  <text start="631.2" dur="3.09">to get cleansed by the water of the word</text>
  <text start="632.67" dur="3.27">and then you can get to the holy place</text>
  <text start="634.29" dur="4.05">where you can start worshipping and</text>
  <text start="635.94" dur="5.22">glorifying y&amp;#39;all and then of course you</text>
  <text start="638.34" dur="4.32">have the manifest presence of yah on the</text>
  <text start="641.16" dur="6.06">Ark of the Covenant in the most holy</text>
  <text start="642.66" dur="7.32">place and of course now after Yahshua</text>
  <text start="647.22" dur="4.11">died and resurrected this Ark is no</text>
  <text start="649.98" dur="5.37">longer needed we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="651.33" dur="5.82">that it&amp;#39;s done away with</text>
  <text start="655.35" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t need an arc because we have his</text>
  <text start="657.15" dur="3.75">presence living in silence now this Ark</text>
  <text start="659.79" dur="3.96">of the Covenant will be brought out</text>
  <text start="660.9" dur="5.01">again but it&amp;#39;s going to be used in the</text>
  <text start="663.75" dur="3.81">great delusion because we read in</text>
  <text start="665.91" dur="3.39">Jeremiah I think it&amp;#39;s Jeremiah chapter 3</text>
  <text start="667.56" dur="3.6">where it says in the Millennial Kingdom</text>
  <text start="669.3" dur="3.9">the thousand year reign that happens</text>
  <text start="671.16" dur="3.51">after the Great Tribulation the ark</text>
  <text start="673.2" dur="3.63">won&amp;#39;t even be remembered or mentioned</text>
  <text start="674.67" dur="3.78">will have a Millennial temple but there</text>
  <text start="676.83" dur="3.6">will not be an art because Yahshua</text>
  <text start="678.45" dur="3.81">himself the Messiah who will be ruling</text>
  <text start="680.43" dur="6.39">and reigning from Jerusalem he will be</text>
  <text start="682.26" dur="6">the Ark as he is our Ark right now but</text>
  <text start="686.82" dur="3.75">on my own Kippur that high priest would</text>
  <text start="688.26" dur="5.79">only go into this most holy place just</text>
  <text start="690.57" dur="5.28">one time a year and you can read about</text>
  <text start="694.05" dur="3.57">this more numbers I think it&amp;#39;s numbers</text>
  <text start="695.85" dur="4.44">chapter 16 and I have some studies about</text>
  <text start="697.62" dur="5.37">this on my website in spirit or calm but</text>
  <text start="700.29" dur="4.23">on Yom Kippur they would have two goats</text>
  <text start="702.99" dur="5.19">they would cast lots there with two</text>
  <text start="704.52" dur="5.82">goats and one goat was sacrificed right</text>
  <text start="708.18" dur="5.31">here on the brazen altar blood was</text>
  <text start="710.34" dur="4.44">spilled it was sacrificed okay and then</text>
  <text start="713.49" dur="3.54">that priest the high priest would take</text>
  <text start="714.78" dur="3.96">he would wash but he would still take</text>
  <text start="717.03" dur="3.99">some of that blood his own one time he</text>
  <text start="718.74" dur="3.69">would take some of the blood and he</text>
  <text start="721.02" dur="3.99">would wash but he wouldn&amp;#39;t remove the</text>
  <text start="722.43" dur="4.65">blood from his fingers and he&amp;#39;d go into</text>
  <text start="725.01" dur="3.63">here and then he&amp;#39;d go past the incense</text>
