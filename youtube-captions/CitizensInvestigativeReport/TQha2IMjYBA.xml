  <text start="219.59" dur="7.22">except for for over 30,000 of them were</text>
  <text start="224.42" dur="4.789">going to an address that was not on the</text>
  <text start="226.81" dur="5.23">distribution list it was a</text>
  <text start="229.209" dur="5.5">compartmentalised bit of information</text>
  <text start="232.04" dur="7.25">that was sending it to an unauthorized</text>

  <text start="245.42" dur="8.16">you shook his hand but</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="9.849">the problem was that it was going to an</text>

  <text start="271.91" dur="6.81">about our national integrity of our</text>
  <text start="275.93" dur="3.51">election when it was involving Hillary</text>
  <text start="278.72" dur="9.36">Clinton</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="15.33">so the forensic examination was done by</text>

  <text start="2632.869" dur="4.321">joe&amp;#39;s judge Boasberg has written his</text>
  <text start="2635.42" dur="4.03">ruling the judicial order will soon</text>
  <text start="2637.19" dur="8.89">follow</text>
  <text start="2639.45" dur="9.06">huh from my reading the FBI provided the</text>
  <text start="2646.08" dur="4.8">docs in camera court eyes only</text>
  <text start="2648.51" dur="10.14">thus the FBI will have to produce them</text>
  <text start="2650.88" dur="9.36">to CNN Oh will CNN report them I imagine</text>
  <text start="2658.65" dur="2.85">they will this doesn&amp;#39;t appear to be one</text>
  <text start="2660.24" dur="2.76">of the cases where the documents were</text>
  <text start="2661.5" dur="3.15">filed under seal in the courts docket</text>
  <text start="2663" dur="5.19">and the court can simply order the clerk</text>
  <text start="2664.65" dur="5.43">to unseal if we good if we get to appeal</text>
  <text start="2668.19" dur="3.21">I assume the production of documents</text>
  <text start="2670.08" dur="5.34">will be put on hold pending the outcome</text>
  <text start="2671.4" dur="5.31">of the appeal so yeah you can come in</text>
  <text start="2675.42" dur="2.85">here and read these I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="2676.71" dur="3.33">make this little okay so that was my</text>
  <text start="2678.27" dur="4.02">report from the other day and then</text>
  <text start="2680.04" dur="5.01">yesterday there was an update on the</text>
  <text start="2682.29" dur="5.01">Comey memo FOIA updates CNN files motion</text>
  <text start="2685.05" dur="5.46">demanding immediate production and the</text>
  <text start="2687.3" dur="4.86">DOJ says 60 days so just a quick update</text>
  <text start="2690.51" dur="3.3">in the ongoing court battle for the</text>
  <text start="2692.16" dur="3.12">Comey memos because we think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2693.81" dur="2.19">gonna be a lot more than we were told</text>
  <text start="2695.28" dur="3.12">and the arc</text>
  <text start="2696" dur="4.14">Archy declarations and then this is</text>
  <text start="2698.4" dur="3.9">background here&amp;#39;s what I just read you</text>
  <text start="2700.14" dur="4.26">CNN has filed a motion for immediate</text>
  <text start="2702.3" dur="5.97">production two days ago Judge James</text>
  <text start="2704.4" dur="7.29">Boasberg ruled that the DOJ and FBI must</text>
  <text start="2708.27" dur="5.43">turn over the most mostly unredacted</text>
  <text start="2711.69" dur="5.37">Comey memos and fully unredacted art</text>
  <text start="2713.7" dur="5.34">Archy declarations to CNN and the media</text>
  <text start="2717.06" dur="3.87">groups represented with the FOIA lawsuit</text>
  <text start="2719.04" dur="2.87">it&amp;#39;s weird how CNN is doing this because</text>
  <text start="2720.93" dur="4.71">they might not like what they see</text>
  <text start="2721.91" dur="5.98">however in response to see.and dated</text>
  <text start="2725.64" dur="4.08">yesterday August 13th the DOJ stated</text>
  <text start="2727.89" dur="3.39">they intend to utilize the full 60-day</text>
  <text start="2729.72" dur="4.05">appellate window before producing the</text>
  <text start="2731.28" dur="4.56">memos and declarations and here it is</text>
  <text start="2733.77" dur="3.6">here the government therefore continues</text>
  <text start="2735.84" dur="5.28">to believe that while proceedings in the</text>
  <text start="2737.37" dur="5.04">district court have concluded so what</text>
  <text start="2741.12" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re saying is thank you for it let</text>
  <text start="2742.41" dur="6.03">me read the whole thing Chuck thank you</text>
  <text start="2746.13" dur="4.35">for your letter August 13th 2019 which</text>
  <text start="2748.44" dur="6.6">does not acknowledge the entirety of my</text>
  <text start="2750.48" dur="7.29">July 10th 2019 email as I stated in this</text>
  <text start="2755.04" dur="7.58">email so this is from the Civil Division</text>
  <text start="2757.77" dur="8.19">to the you to CNN people okay all right</text>
  <text start="2762.62" dur="6.16">which does not ignore me as I stated in</text>
  <text start="2765.96" dur="4.53">the email the courts June 7th order did</text>
  <text start="2768.78" dur="3.63">not include a deadline for production on</text>
  <text start="2770.49" dur="2.91">the documents at issue the court was no</text>
  <text start="2772.41" dur="3.36">doubt aware the governor</text>
  <text start="2773.4" dur="4.73">would have 60 days after its decision</text>
  <text start="2775.77" dur="4.26">within which to decide whether to appeal</text>
  <text start="2778.13" dur="4.48">pursuant to federal rule of appellate</text>
  <text start="2780.03" dur="5.13">procedure and yet it declined to enter</text>
  <text start="2782.61" dur="4.98">specific production schedule the courts</text>
  <text start="2785.16" dur="4.77">recent opinion and order denying the</text>
  <text start="2787.59" dur="5.49">government&amp;#39;s motion pursuant to rule 59</text>
  <text start="2789.93" dur="5.19">also does do not contain a specific date</text>
  <text start="2793.08" dur="3.66">for production the government therefore</text>
  <text start="2795.12" dur="3.06">continues to believe that while</text>
  <text start="2796.74" dur="3.84">proceedings in the district court have</text>
  <text start="2798.18" dur="4.53">concluded it does not have an obligation</text>
  <text start="2800.58" dur="4.68">to produce the documents immediately and</text>
  <text start="2802.71" dur="5.1">will not do so until the time for appeal</text>
  <text start="2805.26" dur="4.83">has run or until resolution of any</text>
  <text start="2807.81" dur="5.07">appeal if the government appeals all</text>
  <text start="2810.09" dur="5.85">right so that&amp;#39;s what it says it looks to</text>
  <text start="2812.88" dur="4.89">me like the DOJ FBI is implying they</text>
  <text start="2815.94" dur="4.17">will produce the mirrored material in 60</text>
  <text start="2817.77" dur="4.65">days and not sooner in a response to</text>
  <text start="2820.11" dur="3.93">that email today CNN has filed motion</text>
  <text start="2822.42" dur="3.36">requesting intervention by the judge</text>
  <text start="2824.04" dur="3.96">demanding immediate production in there</text>
  <text start="2825.78" dur="4.05">you can see the letter okay there is a</text>
  <text start="2828" dur="3.12">possibility the DOJ is delaying</text>
  <text start="2829.83" dur="2.73">production because they want to wait</text>
  <text start="2831.12" dur="4.38">till after the Inspector General report</text>
  <text start="2832.56" dur="8.79">is made public strategically that makes</text>
  <text start="2835.5" dur="7.28">sense so yeah it so oh boy he kind of</text>
  <text start="2841.35" dur="4.47">goes through the story a little bit and</text>
  <text start="2842.78" dur="5.44">mice yeah he repeats himself just a tad</text>
  <text start="2845.82" dur="3.84">and he adds some for context there and I</text>
  <text start="2848.22" dur="3.6">already went over all of this so</text>
  <text start="2849.66" dur="4.62">basically they&amp;#39;re waiting for the IG</text>
  <text start="2851.82" dur="5.04">report and if they this is to me was</text>
  <text start="2854.28" dur="4.38">like a little hint like mmm they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2856.86" dur="4.2">waiting for the IG report and they have</text>
  <text start="2858.66" dur="7.02">60 days we should be getting at any time</text>
  <text start="2861.06" dur="6.81">now I look for perhaps some more</text>
  <text start="2865.68" dur="4.44">information coming out about the Clinton</text>
  <text start="2867.87" dur="4.2">email scandal because they want to set</text>
  <text start="2870.12" dur="3.96">the backdrop that makes perfect sense to</text>
  <text start="2872.07" dur="3.96">me so this whole video really can sum it</text>
  <text start="2874.08" dur="4.2">up in this there try people</text>
  <text start="2876.03" dur="5.25">whistleblowers are coming forward past</text>
  <text start="2878.28" dur="5.1">former FBI employee informants you know</text>
  <text start="2881.28" dur="5.07">non official informants like mr. Bern</text>
  <text start="2883.38" dur="5.25">are coming forward a lot of you know a</text>
  <text start="2886.35" dur="4.89">lot of things are happening and I think</text>
  <text start="2888.63" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re going to get an email</text>
  <text start="2891.24" dur="4.89">investigation a determination that that</text>
  <text start="2893.85" dur="4.8">whole thing was sour okay and here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2896.13" dur="5.85">new findings but and that&amp;#39;s being done</text>
  <text start="2898.65" dur="5.22">by the Inspector General remember I read</text>
  <text start="2901.98" dur="5.04">it to you with Bryan Cates doing a new</text>
  <text start="2903.87" dur="5.43">new email investigation that will</text>
  <text start="2907.02" dur="5.25">set the backdrop for why in the world</text>
  <text start="2909.3" dur="6.27">these people went completely retarded on</text>
  <text start="2912.27" dur="7.8">us okay that&amp;#39;s good it makes perfect</text>
  <text start="2915.57" dur="6.3">sense so and then CNN&amp;#39;s pushing for this</text>
  <text start="2920.07" dur="2.76">information but do they really want it</text>
  <text start="2921.87" dur="2.55">oh boy</text>
  <text start="2922.83" dur="5.24">it&amp;#39;s kind of weird that they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="2924.42" dur="6.12">that so it&amp;#39;s just strange that at CNN</text>
  <text start="2928.07" dur="3.97">Sookie I&amp;#39;ll keep my eye on all of this</text>
