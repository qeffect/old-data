  <text start="46.68" dur="8.21">movement that&amp;#39;s happening first let me</text>
  <text start="50.579" dur="8.841">just say that I am a experienced</text>
  <text start="54.89" dur="7.62">conspiracy researcher I say conspiracy</text>
  <text start="59.42" dur="6.51">researcher most people don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="62.51" dur="6.31">I&amp;#39;m not using the term conspiracy theory</text>
  <text start="65.93" dur="7.71">researcher because I don&amp;#39;t like that</text>
  <text start="68.82" dur="8.61">phrase the term conspiracy theory was</text>
  <text start="73.64" dur="7.269">created by the CIA to simply discredit</text>
  <text start="77.43" dur="7.68">those that challenged the the narrative</text>
  <text start="80.909" dur="7.981">and another thing most of these people</text>
  <text start="85.11" dur="7.29">that that follow cue that are on these</text>

  <text start="96.9" dur="12.9">I mean that&amp;#39;s part of why conspiracy</text>
  <text start="105.95" dur="8.29">skeptics exist because we don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="109.8" dur="8.37">accept the the narrative especially when</text>
  <text start="114.24" dur="7.94">there&amp;#39;s just so many suspect things so</text>
  <text start="118.17" dur="8.97">even when when cue started posting on</text>
  <text start="122.18" dur="8.65">the boards you know right there at the</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="7.97">beginning that was I mean I held I held</text>

  <text start="180.95" dur="8.85">everything else we have known for a very</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="8.58">long time that the media is biased we</text>
  <text start="189.8" dur="8.82">have known for a very long time that the</text>
  <text start="193.67" dur="7.349">Mockingbird Project Mockingbird has been</text>
  <text start="198.62" dur="8.64">in effect for probably longer than I&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="207.26" dur="6.66">country is being infiltrated and and</text>
