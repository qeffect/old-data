  <text start="38.92" dur="5.4">about FISA and that the process was</text>
  <text start="42.37" dur="3.509">totally fine in fact here&amp;#39;s James Comey</text>
  <text start="44.32" dur="4.379">cut 15 what they wanted everyone to hear</text>
  <text start="45.879" dur="5.341">this you say that it was handled in a</text>
  <text start="48.699" dur="5.101">thoughtful and appropriate way he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="51.22" dur="4.74">right I was wrong I was overconfident in</text>
  <text start="53.8" dur="4.83">the procedures that the FBI and justice</text>
  <text start="55.96" dur="4.5">had built over 20 years I thought they</text>
  <text start="58.63" dur="4.019">were a bust enough it&amp;#39;s incredibly hard</text>
  <text start="60.46" dur="3.629">to get a FISA I was overconfident in</text>
  <text start="62.649" dur="3.871">those because he&amp;#39;s right there was real</text>
  <text start="64.089" dur="3.661">sloppy 217 things they either should</text>
  <text start="66.52" dur="3.15">have been in the applications or at</text>
  <text start="67.75" dur="4.5">least discussed and characterized</text>
  <text start="69.67" dur="4.08">differently it was not acceptable said</text>
  <text start="72.25" dur="3.74">there was real sloppiness when they were</text>
  <text start="73.75" dur="6.75">surveilling the Trump campaign Jennifer</text>
  <text start="75.99" dur="6.21">on July 5th 2016 at the end of James</text>
  <text start="80.5" dur="4.229">commis news conference where he</text>
  <text start="82.2" dur="5.14">exonerated Hillary Clinton in the email</text>
  <text start="84.729" dur="3.871">server scandal and usurped the functions</text>
  <text start="87.34" dur="5.69">of the Attorney General of the United</text>
  <text start="88.6" dur="7.53">States I declared him to be a dirty cop</text>
  <text start="93.03" dur="5.17">nothing proved it more than his</text>
  <text start="96.13" dur="5.79">interview yesterday with Chris Wallace</text>
  <text start="98.2" dur="6.18">first of all it&amp;#39;s not hard to get a FISA</text>
  <text start="101.92" dur="4.379">warrant it&amp;#39;s very easy to get a FISA</text>
  <text start="104.38" dur="4.68">warrant it&amp;#39;s all done in secret there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="106.299" dur="3.36">nobody around to buck you you get what</text>
  <text start="109.06" dur="4.8">you want</text>
  <text start="109.659" dur="7.89">Comey is an unabashed liar he was fired</text>
  <text start="113.86" dur="6.81">as FBI director for insubordination for</text>
  <text start="117.549" dur="6.061">lying to people and for abusing the</text>
  <text start="120.67" dur="5.339">power of his office the continuing</text>
  <text start="123.61" dur="5.49">interviews of him on television are</text>
  <text start="126.009" dur="5.191">disgraceful Chris Wallace did a credible</text>
  <text start="129.1" dur="5.28">job yesterday but he missed a number of</text>
  <text start="131.2" dur="6.629">very important opportunities to question</text>
  <text start="134.38" dur="7.109">Comey Comey is nothing more than a liar</text>
  <text start="137.829" dur="6.931">it is so sad to see what he has done to</text>
  <text start="141.489" dur="4.861">the FBI these were not minor matters</text>
  <text start="144.76" dur="4.949">first of all they&amp;#39;re worth 17 there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="146.35" dur="5.67">more than 50 major errors when you go</text>
  <text start="149.709" dur="5.431">back and you look at the appendix</text>
  <text start="152.02" dur="5.31">are attached to the Horowitz report this</text>
  <text start="155.14" dur="5.49">was a purposeful effort on the part of</text>
  <text start="157.33" dur="6.72">the FBI to spy on an American citizen</text>
  <text start="160.63" dur="6.03">and in so doing to spy on all the people</text>
  <text start="164.05" dur="5.04">who communicated with Carter page in an</text>
  <text start="166.66" dur="5.88">effort to get information to use against</text>
  <text start="169.09" dur="5.52">Donald Trump and the notion that James</text>
  <text start="172.54" dur="4.14">Comey can sit there with straight face</text>
  <text start="174.61" dur="5.64">and say that the Donald Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="176.68" dur="5.67">was not spied on is truly really</text>
  <text start="180.25" dur="4.92">sickening for all of us who believe</text>
  <text start="182.35" dur="5.79">deeply that federal law enforcement has</text>
  <text start="185.17" dur="5.7">been severely harmed by what he and the</text>
  <text start="188.14" dur="4.38">people up there did by the way he denied</text>
  <text start="190.87" dur="3.9">during the interview that he knew about</text>
  <text start="192.52" dur="4.77">all this stuff because this was handled</text>
  <text start="194.77" dur="4.89">at the lower levels of the bureau no it</text>
  <text start="197.29" dur="4.62">was not this investigation of Carter</text>
  <text start="199.66" dur="4.5">page and the Trump administration and</text>
  <text start="201.91" dur="5.61">the Hillary Clinton email server were</text>
  <text start="204.16" dur="7.17">all handled out of his office on the</text>
  <text start="207.52" dur="5.94">seventh floor of the FBI another big fat</text>
  <text start="211.33" dur="4.8">lie by a guy who should be</text>
  <text start="213.46" dur="5.34">institutionalized for treatment I mean</text>
  <text start="216.13" dur="5.97">this guy is either the best actor in the</text>
  <text start="218.8" dur="4.98">world or he&amp;#39;s mentally ill hi this is</text>
  <text start="222.1" dur="3.72">Jesse I&amp;#39;m so grateful you&amp;#39;re here</text>
  <text start="223.78" dur="4.5">because this has just been the talk all</text>
  <text start="225.82" dur="5.79">morning for us Chuck Ross said what&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="228.28" dur="5.31">disingenuous about Comey suggesting that</text>
  <text start="231.61" dur="3.84">he had no engagement or involvement in</text>
  <text start="233.59" dur="4.02">this is that for two years he was</text>
  <text start="235.45" dur="3.99">confidentially putting out the innuendo</text>
  <text start="237.61" dur="6.15">that Trump and company are Russian</text>
  <text start="239.44" dur="6.36">Russian assets you say what well he was</text>
  <text start="243.76" dur="4.26">part of the conspiracy led by John</text>
  <text start="245.8" dur="4.86">Brennan and others including the</text>
  <text start="248.02" dur="4.98">Secretary of Defense ash Carter who knew</text>
  <text start="250.66" dur="5.49">about the illegal Pfizer spying that was</text>
  <text start="253" dur="4.73">going on by FBI contractors that started</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="7.17">in 2012</text>
  <text start="257.73" dur="8.26">once the FISA Court under the fantastic</text>
  <text start="263.32" dur="5.19">work of Admiral Mike Rogers who was the</text>
  <text start="265.99" dur="5.01">director of NSA once Rogers discovered</text>
  <text start="268.51" dur="5.94">what was going on the illegal spying by</text>
  <text start="271" dur="6.84">FBI contractors he stopped the illegal</text>
  <text start="274.45" dur="6.719">access to American citizens telephone</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="5.1">and email data that&amp;#39;s when the FBI had</text>
  <text start="281.169" dur="4.021">to figure out a way how to continue to</text>
  <text start="282.94" dur="3">spy on Americans and that&amp;#39;s when they</text>
  <text start="285.19" dur="3.15">went after Carr</text>
  <text start="285.94" dur="6.06">Paige to use the FISA warrants to get</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="6.66">information there&amp;#39;s just no doubt that</text>
  <text start="292" dur="5.94">what the FBI did over a number of years</text>
  <text start="295" dur="5.34">under the tutelage of J of James Comey</text>
  <text start="297.94" dur="4.95">was violate the civil rights of an</text>
  <text start="300.34" dur="4.83">innumerable number of Americans and by</text>
  <text start="302.89" dur="4.62">the way all of the unmasking which</text>
  <text start="305.17" dur="5.73">occurred during the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="307.51" dur="7.8">were authorized by President Obama Susan</text>
  <text start="310.9" dur="6.87">Rice clapper Brennan and Comey so I hope</text>
  <text start="315.31" dur="4.71">that Durham amongst his many chores is</text>
  <text start="317.77" dur="5.01">investigating but not only the leaks of</text>
  <text start="320.02" dur="5.34">classified information not only the</text>
  <text start="322.78" dur="6.12">unmasking not only the illegal seeking</text>
  <text start="325.36" dur="8.31">of Lawrence the list goes on and I think</text>
  <text start="328.9" dur="7.68">actually you know commis presence in all</text>
  <text start="333.67" dur="5.64">of its obnoxiousness is actually very</text>
  <text start="336.58" dur="4.61">healthy for a democracy to see what can</text>
  <text start="339.31" dur="6.06">happen when someone with that much power</text>
  <text start="341.19" dur="7.81">becomes so Craven politically so vile so</text>
  <text start="345.37" dur="6.98">vicious so has such an animus toward a</text>
  <text start="349" dur="6.63">person like Trump that he is willing to</text>
  <text start="352.35" dur="5.62">disobey the Constitution and violate the</text>
  <text start="355.63" dur="5.22">rights not only of Carter page but of</text>
  <text start="357.97" dur="4.92">hundreds and hundreds of Americans who</text>
  <text start="360.85" dur="3.24">were covered by those fives attached</text>
  <text start="362.89" dur="2.82">yeah and he only makes that point</text>
  <text start="364.09" dur="3.66">stronger when he tells such bald-faced</text>
  <text start="365.71" dur="4.709">lies is this one that he told to Chris</text>
  <text start="367.75" dur="3.75">Wallace Wallace confronting him about it</text>
  <text start="370.419" dur="3.331">during the interview take a listen</text>
  <text start="371.5" dur="5.58">Specter general did not find misconduct</text>
  <text start="373.75" dur="7.14">by any FBI people he found mistakes and</text>
  <text start="377.08" dur="5.4">negligent and oversupplied Smith he has</text>
  <text start="380.89" dur="3.72">referred it for a criminal investigation</text>
  <text start="382.48" dur="3.63">right but that&amp;#39;s not been resolved this</text>
  <text start="384.61" dur="4.2">business with the lawyer changing some</text>
  <text start="386.11" dur="7.77">email to a partner on the team you make</text>
  <text start="388.81" dur="7.47">it sound like it&amp;#39;s not much not a source</text>
  <text start="393.88" dur="3.75">- not a source is a big beer yeah I mean</text>
  <text start="396.28" dur="3.6">you have James Comey judge Jennifer</text>
  <text start="397.63" dur="6.15">saying there was no misconduct the IG</text>
  <text start="399.88" dur="6.77">found none look look you are listening</text>
  <text start="403.78" dur="7.08">while you are listening to James Comey</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="7.66">to a man remember who had complete</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="4.11">authority over spying on American</text>
  <text start="414.31" dur="3.21">citizens</text>
  <text start="414.97" dur="4.74">you know I gave a speech at Hillsdale</text>
  <text start="417.52" dur="6.12">College where I started off by</text>
  <text start="419.71" dur="6.96">saying it used to be that the FBI spied</text>
  <text start="423.64" dur="3.72">on the Russians this time they spied on</text>
  <text start="426.67" dur="5.49">us</text>
  <text start="427.36" dur="8.76">nothing is truer than that James Comey</text>
  <text start="432.16" dur="6.84">led a cabal he did it under the aegis of</text>
  <text start="436.12" dur="4.11">having lawful authority he did it under</text>
  <text start="439" dur="4.08">the color of law</text>
  <text start="440.23" dur="4.32">he lied repeatedly about it just think</text>
  <text start="443.08" dur="4.17">about what he said in that interview</text>
  <text start="444.55" dur="6.39">about what Kleinschmidt the lawyer did</text>
  <text start="447.25" dur="7.98">Klein Smith changed a document from the</text>
  <text start="450.94" dur="7.02">CIA which said that Carter page was in</text>
  <text start="455.23" dur="5.76">fact an asset of theirs who worked with</text>
  <text start="457.96" dur="7.23">them and he was credible Klein Smith&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.99" dur="8.13">an FBI lawyer mind you lawyer changed</text>
  <text start="465.19" dur="8.07">that email to say that Carter page was</text>
  <text start="469.12" dur="7.35">not an asset of the CIA Comey says</text>
  <text start="473.26" dur="7.92">that&amp;#39;s a nothing Berger James Comey is a</text>
  <text start="476.47" dur="6.06">very sick man sick sick sick all right</text>
  <text start="481.18" dur="2.67">we can spend more time with George enof</text>
  <text start="482.53" dur="2.85">in a minute we want to get his reaction</text>
  <text start="483.85" dur="3.36">to the impeachment news this week and</text>
  <text start="485.38" dur="4.56">more on that inspector general report in</text>
  <text start="487.21" dur="4.23">the abuses it revealed we&amp;#39;re talking to</text>
  <text start="489.94" dur="2.79">former US Attorney Joe - Jenna but we</text>
  <text start="491.44" dur="2.76">haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to speak with him</text>
  <text start="492.73" dur="2.79">since the release of the Inspector</text>
  <text start="494.2" dur="3.3">General&amp;#39;s report so I want to get into</text>
  <text start="495.52" dur="4.35">some of what he found interesting there</text>
  <text start="497.5" dur="5.13">Joe we already talked about Kevin Kline</text>
  <text start="499.87" dur="4.5">Smith the FBI lawyer manipulating emails</text>
  <text start="502.63" dur="4.11">to make them say the opposite of the</text>
  <text start="504.37" dur="3.81">truth that&amp;#39;s a huge deal we also found</text>
  <text start="506.74" dur="5.82">out that the President of the United</text>
  <text start="508.18" dur="6.33">States an FBI agent went into supposedly</text>
  <text start="512.56" dur="3.81">briefed him on general matters related</text>
  <text start="514.51" dur="4.08">to Russia he and general Mike Flynn and</text>
  <text start="516.37" dur="6.15">instead was gathering intelligence on</text>
  <text start="518.59" dur="6.15">both men and we also found out that they</text>
  <text start="522.52" dur="4.23">interviewed Christopher Steele&amp;#39;s sub</text>
  <text start="524.74" dur="4.5">sources primary source for that dossier</text>
  <text start="526.75" dur="4.23">funded by the Hillary campaign found out</text>
  <text start="529.24" dur="4.17">that the source thought that Christopher</text>
  <text start="530.98" dur="4.14">Steele lacked credibility but the FBI</text>
  <text start="533.41" dur="3.48">didn&amp;#39;t tell the FISA Court instead</text>
  <text start="535.12" dur="4.2">referring only to the sub source as</text>
  <text start="536.89" dur="3.99">quote credible and using that to reapply</text>
  <text start="539.32" dur="3.87">yet again for a surveillance warrant</text>
  <text start="540.88" dur="4.38">against against the Trump campaign what</text>
  <text start="543.19" dur="8.79">stood out to you as among the most</text>
  <text start="545.26" dur="8.37">egregious underscore that the horowitz</text>
  <text start="551.98" dur="3.51">report notwithstanding</text>
  <text start="553.63" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s conclusions which are irrelevant</text>
  <text start="555.49" dur="7.77">the raw data in the Horowitz reports is</text>
  <text start="559.39" dur="8.43">a frightening example of 1984 it is</text>
  <text start="563.26" dur="7.98">Orwellian we have the the most powerful</text>
  <text start="567.82" dur="6.75">law-enforcement agency in the world with</text>

  <text start="590.38" dur="6.36">knowing them to be innocent lying about</text>
  <text start="593.8" dur="6.81">those things that they did to federal</text>

  <text start="618.61" dur="6.17">independent counsel and as a person who</text>

  <text start="645.37" dur="5.37">report the Horowitz report is only part</text>
  <text start="648.1" dur="4.35">of it you have to go back and look what</text>
  <text start="650.74" dur="4.59">they did in the Hillary Clinton case</text>
  <text start="652.45" dur="5.67">when the senior Justice Department</text>

  <text start="666.19" dur="5.43">this and the people at the FBI and that</text>
  <text start="668.59" dur="5.13">the CIA got away with this because all</text>
