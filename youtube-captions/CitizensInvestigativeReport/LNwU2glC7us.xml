  <text start="2183.76" dur="2.97">what you see here is a pattern that</text>
  <text start="2185.109" dur="4.591">emerged that during the Obama</text>
  <text start="2186.73" dur="5.43">administration Joe Biden became point</text>

  <text start="2269.56" dur="6.679">candidate yeah I think they would Sean</text>
  <text start="2273.88" dur="4.879">no background in China</text>
  <text start="2276.239" dur="4.92">limited experience in private equity was</text>
