  <text start="220.5" dur="4.739">get this we get this read it&amp;#39;s sequence</text>
  <text start="222.329" dur="7.141">register here and then we get sequence</text>
  <text start="225.239" dur="6.451">complete here and then our t means real</text>
  <text start="229.47" dur="5.879">time so this is in real time this was in</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="5.31">real time night crawl of three you can</text>

  <text start="1642.16" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s something and I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="1643.66" dur="4.11">defend any one individual in this in</text>

  <text start="1651.43" dur="3.78">those are conversations they were having</text>
  <text start="1653.14" dur="4.08">yes and those are based off of the</text>

  <text start="1677.05" dur="3.18">landed it no and I think that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1679.03" dur="3.99">important thing to remember so the</text>
  <text start="1680.23" dur="5.55">system worked the way it was supposed to</text>
  <text start="1683.02" dur="4.92">as it relates to whether and remove the</text>

  <text start="1699.79" dur="5.31">what you&amp;#39;re not allowed to do is try to</text>

  <text start="1711.61" dur="3">that they were considering it because</text>
  <text start="1713.23" dur="2.73">they didn&amp;#39;t like the policies and I</text>
  <text start="1714.61" dur="3.18">don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the case that were</text>
  <text start="1715.96" dur="4.68">they considers a genuine concern about</text>
  <text start="1717.79" dur="3.94">how Russia was involved in this okay but</text>
  <text start="1720.64" dur="3.76">so the amendment was</text>
  <text start="1721.73" dur="5.28">written after Woodrow Wilson suffered a</text>

  <text start="1728.45" dur="4.05">fine president but we didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1730.16" dur="3.54">repeat that so this was specifically</text>
  <text start="1732.5" dur="3.63">written and every lawyer knows this</text>
  <text start="1733.7" dur="4.14">including the ones that the FBI for a</text>

  <text start="1747.23" dur="3.66">thinking about there was big concern</text>
  <text start="1748.79" dur="3.81">again when you look at the timing of</text>
  <text start="1750.89" dur="3.69">mccabe going into office and again he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1752.6" dur="3.69">obviously a flawed messenger in many</text>
  <text start="1754.58" dur="4.53">ways but when you look at the time that</text>
  <text start="1756.29" dur="4.77">that he was elevated to his position was</text>
  <text start="1759.11" dur="4.26">right after james comey was fired and</text>
  <text start="1761.06" dur="3.93">why was james comey fired as the</text>
  <text start="1763.37" dur="3.66">president said himself because he wanted</text>
  <text start="1764.99" dur="3.69">the russia investigation to end okay but</text>
  <text start="1767.03" dur="2.85">clearly there was a concern but the</text>
  <text start="1768.68" dur="2.58">other way well there was a concern</text>
  <text start="1769.88" dur="3.57">because a guy they liked who was their</text>
  <text start="1771.26" dur="4.2">boss got fired which is absolutely the</text>
  <text start="1773.45" dur="3.93">prerogative of this or any president to</text>
  <text start="1775.46" dur="3.21">fire his own employees if he wants for</text>
  <text start="1777.38" dur="3.09">whatever reason he wants it if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1778.67" dur="3.12">like it impeach him her vote against him</text>
  <text start="1780.47" dur="3.9">unless it&amp;#39;s viewed as obstruction of</text>
  <text start="1781.79" dur="4.17">justice okay but I mean but under no</text>
  <text start="1784.37" dur="4.71">plausible scenario could it be I mean</text>
  <text start="1785.96" dur="4.32">because of course the FBI director is</text>
  <text start="1789.08" dur="2.46">free to say whatever he wanted to</text>
  <text start="1790.28" dur="2.31">congressional committees or the Mulliner</text>
  <text start="1791.54" dur="3.21">investigation or write a book which</text>
