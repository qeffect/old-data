  <text start="235.39" dur="3.51">that&amp;#39;s foundational to this so he says a</text>
  <text start="237.16" dur="4.23">lot has happened since that article was</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="4.2">published so in a week first the Gateway</text>
  <text start="241.39" dur="4.14">pundit picked up and amplify the story</text>
  <text start="243.1" dur="4.35">then I was told the story found its way</text>
  <text start="245.53" dur="3.9">to the desks of the Italian prime</text>
  <text start="247.45" dur="3.629">minister as well as the Italian</text>
  <text start="249.43" dur="4.2">president which sounds like panic if he</text>
  <text start="251.079" dur="4.681">asked me and perhaps most tellingly</text>
  <text start="253.63" dur="5.22">former Italian Prime Minister Matteo</text>

  <text start="262.96" dur="4.08">radical Left Party that previously held</text>
  <text start="265.419" dur="4.561">power at the same time as Obama</text>
  <text start="267.04" dur="4.71">and who you&amp;#39;ll recall was implicated as</text>
  <text start="269.98" dur="4.08">someone who was colluding with the Obama</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="3.96">with Obama during this whole framing</text>
  <text start="274.06" dur="4.35">operation so here it is here basically</text>
  <text start="275.71" dur="4.23">he&amp;#39;s going to possibly step down so now</text>
  <text start="278.41" dur="3.9">he says now another writer by the name</text>
