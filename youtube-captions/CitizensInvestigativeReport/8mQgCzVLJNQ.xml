  <text start="153.53" dur="3.96">under the Clinton administration to</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="4.74">provide Iran with a flawed design for</text>
  <text start="157.49" dur="4.71">component of a nuclear weapon ostensibly</text>
  <text start="159.77" dur="5.73">in order to delay the alleged Iranian</text>
  <text start="162.2" dur="5.07">nuclear weapons program or to frame Iran</text>
  <text start="165.5" dur="3.48">so if you want to read more about it you</text>
  <text start="167.27" dur="4.47">can click on this and it&amp;#39;s gonna give</text>
  <text start="168.98" dur="6.27">you the history James Verizon was in New</text>

  <text start="192.98" dur="3.05">you hopefully this will be much easier</text>
  <text start="194.06" dur="5.39">for you to get a hold of my notes</text>
  <text start="196.03" dur="8.13">operation Merlin backfired when CIA</text>
  <text start="199.45" dur="6.22">Russian contact messenger his name was</text>
  <text start="204.16" dur="3.73">it&amp;#39;s crazy</text>
  <text start="205.67" dur="4.11">notice flaws in the schematics and told</text>
  <text start="207.89" dur="4.23">the Iranian nuclear scientists instead</text>
  <text start="209.78" dur="4.679">of crippling Iran&amp;#39;s nuclear program the</text>
  <text start="212.12" dur="3.839">book alleged operation Merlin may have</text>
  <text start="214.459" dur="3.691">accelerated it by providing useful</text>
  <text start="215.959" dur="3.931">information once the flaws were</text>
  <text start="218.15" dur="3.75">identified the plans could be compared</text>
  <text start="219.89" dur="5.58">with other sources such as those who</text>
  <text start="221.9" dur="6.57">have been presumed to have been provided</text>
  <text start="225.47" dur="6.36">by the Iranians by a Hugh Khan okay and</text>
  <text start="228.47" dur="5.1">the CIA guy was Jeffrey sterling I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="231.83" dur="4.11">remember him a couple years ago his</text>
  <text start="233.57" dur="5.43">trial was vaguely in the news where he</text>
  <text start="235.94" dur="5.16">was convicted all right so that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="239" dur="5.7">operation Merlin is and what the post is</text>
  <text start="241.1" dur="6.54">saying here is operation Merlin provided</text>
  <text start="244.7" dur="5.37">the tech to Iran and North Korea past</text>
  <text start="247.64" dur="4.95">from Iran to North Korea so the next</text>
  <text start="250.07" dur="4.08">part um let&amp;#39;s see what when I was I</text>
  <text start="252.59" dur="5.22">don&amp;#39;t even remember what I put was not</text>
  <text start="254.15" dur="5.55">that long ago so then it provided Iran</text>
  <text start="257.81" dur="3.87">with the technology necessary to build</text>
  <text start="259.7" dur="5.46">nuclear weapons and pass on to North</text>
  <text start="261.68" dur="5.01">Korea and this is a an old New York Post</text>
  <text start="265.16" dur="3.15">from back in the day when</text>
  <text start="266.69" dur="4.74">when this was going on it&amp;#39;s time to take</text>
  <text start="268.31" dur="5.16">on the Iran North Korea new clients and</text>
  <text start="271.43" dur="5.73">it just shows you it talks about how</text>
  <text start="273.47" dur="7.1">they provided provided North Korea with</text>
  <text start="277.16" dur="6.78">the technology that they needed okay and</text>
  <text start="280.57" dur="6.1">then Iran deal was provided the funding</text>
  <text start="283.94" dur="6.33">ok provided by US and Barack Obama and</text>
  <text start="286.67" dur="5.88">this talks about us transferred 1.3</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="3.33">billion more in cash to Iran after the</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="5.13">initial payment it talks about the</text>
  <text start="293.6" dur="5.52">funding and then this this is sort of a</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="3.06">piggy back to this one because then you</text>
  <text start="299.12" dur="2.76">can in this article they were written</text>
  <text start="300.74" dur="5.25">right around the same time and you can</text>
  <text start="301.88" dur="7.68">see how money was funded bundled good</text>
  <text start="305.99" dur="5.28">Lord money was funneled from Iran to</text>
  <text start="309.56" dur="4.26">North Korea so read those two articles</text>
  <text start="311.27" dur="4.83">is pretty interesting and then the next</text>
  <text start="313.82" dur="4.65">thing says Iran funds t-cells terror</text>
  <text start="316.1" dur="4.47">cells and then this article backs that</text>
  <text start="318.47" dur="4.65">up inside the ring Obama&amp;#39;s era cash</text>
  <text start="320.57" dur="3.87">traced who I ran back terrorists which</text>
  <text start="323.12" dur="4.41">is exactly what happened</text>
  <text start="324.44" dur="5.1">Iran gives North Korea funding North</text>
  <text start="327.53" dur="4.32">Korea&amp;#39;s deadly partnership with Iran and</text>
  <text start="329.54" dur="5.07">this talks about their funding Iran had</text>
  <text start="331.85" dur="4.92">oil Iran had cash North Korea had</text>
  <text start="334.61" dur="7.44">weapons but no cash and no oil so it was</text>
  <text start="336.77" dur="8.25">an ideal match and then North Korea Iran</text>
  <text start="342.05" dur="7.77">our nuclear pals Iran in North Korea</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="8.16">dangerous partners in an in nuclear so</text>
