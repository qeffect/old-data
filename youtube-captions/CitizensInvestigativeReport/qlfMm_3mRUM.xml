  <text start="8.389" dur="4.101">my name is Mary and I&amp;#39;m from</text>
  <text start="10.01" dur="6.39">Massachusetts and I&amp;#39;m doing this video</text>
  <text start="12.49" dur="5.41">to say that I support the Q team and I</text>
  <text start="16.4" dur="7.17">support the Liberty movement in this</text>
  <text start="17.9" dur="7.56">country and also worldwide because like</text>
  <text start="23.57" dur="3.51">many people I&amp;#39;ve seen that something has</text>
  <text start="25.46" dur="7.049">gone terribly terribly wrong in this</text>
  <text start="27.08" dur="9.3">country and and so I&amp;#39;m very very</text>
  <text start="32.509" dur="8.611">grateful that somebody within within the</text>
  <text start="36.38" dur="6.06">government has come forward and decided</text>
  <text start="41.12" dur="5.25">that they were going to help not only</text>
  <text start="42.44" dur="7.5">help the president but also help the</text>
  <text start="46.37" dur="5.69">citizens of our nation in order to take</text>
  <text start="49.94" dur="5.55">you know help us take our country back</text>
  <text start="52.06" dur="5.98">but to do it through peaceful means and</text>
  <text start="55.49" dur="7.38">I believe that that is what the Q team</text>
  <text start="58.04" dur="8.1">has been doing is giving us and giving</text>
  <text start="62.87" dur="7.2">us information to research and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="66.14" dur="8.64">helping us and it&amp;#39;s helping us to look</text>
  <text start="70.07" dur="6.27">at the truth as it is not as the</text>
  <text start="74.78" dur="8.06">propagandists would have us believe</text>
  <text start="76.34" dur="12.419">anymore and I can&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t say exactly</text>
  <text start="82.84" dur="8.949">what made me what made me follow the Q</text>
  <text start="88.759" dur="9">team I know that it started a while ago</text>
  <text start="91.789" dur="11.4">and the proof and the proofs for me I</text>
  <text start="97.759" dur="11.42">have a couple one of them was the</text>
  <text start="103.189" dur="11">tippy-top but also the timing when Q</text>
  <text start="109.179" dur="9.55">drops a clue and then the president</text>
  <text start="114.189" dur="6.82">would also tweet and they would do it</text>
  <text start="118.729" dur="6.42">within a coordinated amount of time with</text>
  <text start="121.009" dur="6.841">each other to me that&amp;#39;s to me those are</text>
  <text start="125.149" dur="4.89">huge those are huge proofs but also the</text>

  <text start="137.209" dur="8.31">and that just really really spoke</text>
  <text start="140.9" dur="8.009">volumes to me and proved to me that our</text>
  <text start="145.519" dur="7.651">president knows what&amp;#39;s going on he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.909" dur="8.791">aware of her movement and he knows that</text>
