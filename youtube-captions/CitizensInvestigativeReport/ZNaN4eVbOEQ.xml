  <text start="8.77" dur="3.33">Southwest I want to tell you thanks for</text>
  <text start="10.6" dur="3.42">all you do and I think this is a</text>
  <text start="12.1" dur="4.17">brilliant idea to get a bunch of</text>
  <text start="14.02" dur="4.829">Americans out there of different walks</text>
  <text start="16.27" dur="4.5">of life different areas and let us tell</text>
  <text start="18.849" dur="5.941">our little stories and mine&amp;#39;s very short</text>
  <text start="20.77" dur="5.309">I started watching queue late November</text>
  <text start="24.79" dur="3.6">early December sometime around</text>
  <text start="26.079" dur="5.07">Thanksgiving and I believed right off</text>
  <text start="28.39" dur="4.259">because once I was in a Chan and started</text>
  <text start="31.149" dur="3.781">figuring that out and saw some of the</text>
  <text start="32.649" dur="5.221">things that they were figuring out I was</text>
  <text start="34.93" dur="4.859">very on board and so many things have</text>
  <text start="37.87" dur="3.329">come up since then I think probably if</text>
  <text start="39.789" dur="3.27">you had to ask a lot of people one of</text>
  <text start="41.199" dur="4.441">the most important things they saw it</text>
  <text start="43.059" dur="5.191">would probably be the top top tippy top</text>
  <text start="45.64" dur="4.62">comment on Easter and I&amp;#39;m just just so</text>
  <text start="48.25" dur="4.98">not like something our POTUS would say</text>
  <text start="50.26" dur="5.97">and yet he did say that in response to</text>
  <text start="53.23" dur="4.949">being asked to say that by an anon so</text>
  <text start="56.23" dur="3.48">that was really telling there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="58.179" dur="3.75">some pictures inside of Air Force One</text>
  <text start="59.71" dur="4.559">looking out and inside of Air Force one</text>
  <text start="61.929" dur="4.561">with the reflection of an apple phone</text>
  <text start="64.269" dur="4.381">that I thought were very good as well</text>
  <text start="66.49" dur="3.72">but it just goes on and on and on</text>
  <text start="68.65" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s hundreds literally</text>
  <text start="70.21" dur="4.2">hundreds of things that he comes out and</text>
  <text start="72.73" dur="3.69">tells us and it comes out either in the</text>
  <text start="74.41" dur="6.09">news or a tweet from the POTUS or</text>
  <text start="76.42" dur="5.49">something shortly thereafter so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="80.5" dur="2.94">think it takes a lot to convince</text>
  <text start="81.91" dur="4.02">somebody it&amp;#39;s real if you can just get</text>
  <text start="83.44" dur="4.83">them to take a look at it so red pill</text>
  <text start="85.93" dur="5.25">all you can I do live in an area that</text>
  <text start="88.27" dur="5.25">has had rallies here back in the fall</text>
