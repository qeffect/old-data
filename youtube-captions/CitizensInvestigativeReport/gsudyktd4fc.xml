  <text start="134.08" dur="4.11">conflicting reports and speculation</text>
  <text start="136.36" dur="3.14">continue to shroud the classified</text>
  <text start="138.19" dur="4.11">mission</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="5.11">SpaceX kicked off the year with a</text>
  <text start="142.3" dur="3.719">at nine launch of the classified Zuma</text>
  <text start="144.61" dur="4.65">payload a satellite or spacecraft</text>
  <text start="146.019" dur="5.311">supplied by Northrop Grumman for the US</text>
  <text start="149.26" dur="3.69">government the launch on Sunday night</text>
  <text start="151.33" dur="3.84">January 7th at 8 p.m.</text>
  <text start="152.95" dur="4.8">appeared to go off without a hitch to</text>
  <text start="155.17" dur="4.62">those watching the live coverage since</text>
  <text start="157.75" dur="4.26">it was a national security payload</text>
  <text start="159.79" dur="4.979">SpaceX did not broadcast the flight of</text>
  <text start="162.01" dur="4.71">the second stage after it&amp;#39;s separated</text>
  <text start="164.769" dur="3.841">from the first stage or separation of</text>
  <text start="166.72" dur="3.81">the payload from the second stage the</text>
  <text start="168.61" dur="4.62">next morning reports from anonymous</text>
  <text start="170.53" dur="4.56">government an industrial industry</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="5.009">officials suggested that something went</text>
  <text start="175.09" dur="6.59">wrong here&amp;#39;s where you this is this is</text>
  <text start="178.239" dur="9.36">what you call you know if you can&amp;#39;t okay</text>
  <text start="181.68" dur="7.48">they&amp;#39;re anonymous so then the Wall</text>
  <text start="187.599" dur="3.211">Street Journal came out with an article</text>
  <text start="189.16" dur="4.079">then Bloomberg came out saying it was</text>
  <text start="190.81" dur="4.95">anonymous sources again this is where</text>
  <text start="193.239" dur="6.81">you got a P excited as anonymous sources</text>
  <text start="195.76" dur="5.52">I mean really so basically you know this</text>
  <text start="200.049" dur="2.94">is a classified mission we cannot</text>
  <text start="201.28" dur="3.69">comment I mean it&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="202.989" dur="3.541">so then SpaceX gave a statement it said</text>
  <text start="204.97" dur="4.829">for clarity after reviewing all the data</text>
  <text start="206.53" dur="5.549">to date sokka nine did everything</text>
  <text start="209.799" dur="4.05">correctly on Sunday night if we or</text>
  <text start="212.079" dur="3.361">others find otherwise based on future</text>
  <text start="213.849" dur="3.48">further review we will report it</text>
  <text start="215.44" dur="3.15">immediately information published that</text>
  <text start="217.329" dur="3.121">is contrary to the statement is</text>
  <text start="218.59" dur="3.36">categorically false due to the</text>
  <text start="220.45" dur="6.569">classified nature of the payload no</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="7.11">further comment as possible you know so</text>
  <text start="227.019" dur="3.33">you know they could just be skirting</text>
  <text start="229.06" dur="3.299">around the issue saying hey they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="230.349" dur="3.871">their little part of it was successful</text>
  <text start="232.359" dur="4.53">but then you know it crashed into the</text>
  <text start="234.22" dur="5.31">Indian Ocean well I think maybe we</text>
  <text start="236.889" dur="4.71">should get some some pictures of that or</text>
  <text start="239.53" dur="4.38">somebody&amp;#39;s somebody official coming out</text>
  <text start="241.599" dur="3.601">and telling us because we&amp;#39;re you know we</text>
  <text start="243.91" dur="4.59">got to read between the lines here so</text>
  <text start="245.2" dur="7.469">it&amp;#39;s murky right and we got to remember</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="5.79">that this information is necessary okay</text>
  <text start="252.669" dur="6.091">just keep that in mind according to Q</text>
  <text start="254.29" dur="7.41">okay so let me close these out here let</text>

  <text start="642.989" dur="3.361">been looking at this section 702 so in</text>

  <text start="664.54" dur="5.159">of the dossier whether it was whether it</text>

  <text start="671.889" dur="5.55">already been started it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="673.839" dur="5.55">the point is it was used in front of the</text>
  <text start="677.439" dur="4.95">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance at</text>

  <text start="750.249" dur="4.95">knowledge I&amp;#39;ve been getting a lot of</text>
  <text start="753.22" dur="4.169">information from and for example the</text>
  <text start="755.199" dur="5.34">other day I got a letter from 43 former</text>

  <text start="774.699" dur="4.95">have in fact all of this has been</text>
  <text start="776.439" dur="4.98">confirmed by them and it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="779.649" dur="3.21">you know Nunez took a bunch of heat when</text>
  <text start="781.419" dur="3.96">during the true you know when when</text>
  <text start="782.859" dur="4.111">President Trump took office you you will</text>
  <text start="785.379" dur="3.99">recall that Nunez went to the White</text>
  <text start="786.97" dur="4.39">House and reviewed some documents that</text>
  <text start="789.369" dur="4.831">had been provided by the NSA</text>
  <text start="791.36" dur="4.86">read Admiral Rogers and in the NFC</text>
  <text start="794.2" dur="3.46">offices over at the White House and</text>
  <text start="796.22" dur="2.97">that&amp;#39;s when he held his famous press</text>
  <text start="797.66" dur="3.63">conference saying he had seen things</text>
  <text start="799.19" dur="3.93">that had nothing to do with Russian</text>
  <text start="801.29" dur="5.07">collusion these were the illegal</text>
  <text start="803.12" dur="5.58">intercepts that he saw those were the</text>
  <text start="806.36" dur="4.56">dozen what are called these were these</text>
  <text start="808.7" dur="4.889">were these printouts that were viewed by</text>
  <text start="810.92" dur="4.979">Susan Rice and others in the White House</text>
  <text start="813.589" dur="3.631">after they had requested the unmasking</text>
  <text start="815.899" dur="3.69">of Trump associates</text>
  <text start="817.22" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s what Nunez saw and that&amp;#39;s what he</text>
  <text start="819.589" dur="4.171">realized and of course Rogers Admiral</text>
  <text start="821.72" dur="4.29">Rogers was directly responsible for that</text>
  <text start="823.76" dur="3.6">information going to the White House one</text>
  <text start="826.01" dur="3.75">thing that&amp;#39;s very interesting in the</text>
  <text start="827.36" dur="4.83">midst of all this prior to the election</text>
  <text start="829.76" dur="4.35">in October when Admiral Rogers was doing</text>
  <text start="832.19" dur="4.17">his investigation and reporting all of</text>
  <text start="834.11" dur="4.169">this by the way to the FISA Court what</text>
  <text start="836.36" dur="3.63">he was discovering the head of the</text>
  <text start="838.279" dur="3.961">National Security Division at justice</text>
  <text start="839.99" dur="4.26">john carlin resigned in the middle of</text>
  <text start="842.24" dur="4.2">all of this it&amp;#39;s really kind of weird</text>
  <text start="844.25" dur="4.17">that he would have resigned prior to the</text>
  <text start="846.44" dur="3.93">election when it was clear that bunk</text>
  <text start="848.42" dur="4.5">Hillary was going to win and he was in</text>
  <text start="850.37" dur="4.2">line for a bigger job unfortunately what</text>
  <text start="852.92" dur="3.99">he discovered was that Admiral Rogers</text>
  <text start="854.57" dur="4.949">got his number and was reporting his</text>
  <text start="856.91" dur="3.9">name to the FISA Court as one of the</text>
  <text start="859.519" dur="3.481">people who had been involved in</text>
  <text start="860.81" dur="4.44">providing information to the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="863" dur="5.55">which at that point they did not deem</text>
  <text start="865.25" dur="4.68">reliable in addition what happening</text>
  <text start="868.55" dur="5.159">today</text>
  <text start="869.93" dur="7.349">judge Contreras who took Mike Flynn&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="873.709" dur="5.401">guilty plea has recused himself from any</text>
  <text start="877.279" dur="5.221">further proceedings in the fling case</text>
  <text start="879.11" dur="7.589">now ask yourself a question why did</text>
  <text start="882.5" dur="5.67">Judge Contreras recuse himself now after</text>
  <text start="886.699" dur="4.371">he took the guilty plea</text>
  <text start="888.17" dur="5.789">why didn&amp;#39;t he recuse himself during</text>
  <text start="891.07" dur="5.53">before he took the guilty plea how can</text>
  <text start="893.959" dur="4.831">he have a conflict now and not have a</text>
  <text start="896.6" dur="4.679">conflict at the time he took the guilty</text>
  <text start="898.79" dur="4.08">plea and the answer is judge Contreras</text>
  <text start="901.279" dur="4.141">was one of the judges sitting on the</text>
  <text start="902.87" dur="5.52">FISA Court and the question has been</text>
  <text start="905.42" dur="6.359">asked what the FISA warrants was he</text>
  <text start="908.39" dur="4.86">involved in and what did he review that</text>
  <text start="911.779" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s question has not been answered</text>
  <text start="913.25" dur="4.5">either by him the u.s. district court</text>
  <text start="915.769" dur="5.13">the United States Court of Appeals or</text>
  <text start="917.75" dur="5.43">the FISA Court I assume that Nunez and</text>
  <text start="920.899" dur="4.231">his people have the answer and it will</text>
  <text start="923.18" dur="5.4">be part of their report and I think</text>
  <text start="925.13" dur="6.81">and the judge recused himself with it he</text>
  <text start="928.58" dur="4.89">has learned that his his work in this</text>
  <text start="931.94" dur="3.06">which I&amp;#39;m not doubting anything the</text>
  <text start="933.47" dur="3.99">judge Contreras did by the way he</text>
  <text start="935" dur="5.01">probably acted properly got stuff in</text>
  <text start="937.46" dur="5.07">writing in under oath from FBI agents</text>
  <text start="940.01" dur="5.34">and and DOJ lawyers and acted upon it</text>
  <text start="942.53" dur="5.43">the question remains why did he sit in a</text>
  <text start="945.35" dur="5.85">case where me where he may have reviewed</text>
  <text start="947.96" dur="3.87">warrants so it&amp;#39;s a very interesting</text>
  <text start="951.2" dur="3.24">question</text>
  <text start="951.83" dur="6.03">and it simply adds to the pile of</text>
  <text start="954.44" dur="7.32">evidence that&amp;#39;s a real treason that went</text>
  <text start="957.86" dur="6.84">on here was not by the Trump campaign or</text>
  <text start="961.76" dur="6.57">the Trump elect presidency but by people</text>
  <text start="964.7" dur="6.66">at DOJ in the FBI who conspired who</text>
  <text start="968.33" dur="4.92">conspired to frame an incoming president</text>
  <text start="971.36" dur="3.45">of the United States with false fronts</text>
  <text start="973.25" dur="3.72">Joe very quickly the House Intelligence</text>
  <text start="974.81" dur="4.74">Committee has this information how</text>
  <text start="976.97" dur="6.24">quickly does this move pretty fast</text>
  <text start="979.55" dur="5.22">because the old IGS report from the</text>
  <text start="983.21" dur="3.42">Inspector General of the Department of</text>
  <text start="984.77" dur="3.96">Justice will be issuing a report some</text>
  <text start="986.63" dur="4.29">say in the spring I say much sooner in</text>
  <text start="988.73" dur="3.99">which he will make recommendations one</text>
  <text start="990.92" dur="4.86">of which will be to impanel a grand jury</text>
  <text start="992.72" dur="5.49">against the FBI and DOJ officials who</text>
  <text start="995.78" dur="3.93">violated federal law Wow okay well Jenna</text>
  <text start="998.21" dur="3.99">please keep on keeping your ear to the</text>
  <text start="999.71" dur="4.59">ground in your voice okay that&amp;#39;s it guys</text>
  <text start="1002.2" dur="3.57">imagine that I&amp;#39;m not gonna say too much</text>
  <text start="1004.3" dur="4.44">about it he pretty much said it all but</text>
  <text start="1005.77" dur="5.28">this judge Contreras it says here when I</text>
  <text start="1008.74" dur="4.86">read it I remember reading this the</text>
  <text start="1011.05" dur="4.71">court spokeswoman Lisa Clem did not say</text>
  <text start="1013.6" dur="7.29">why Contreras was recused well now we</text>
  <text start="1015.76" dur="9.03">know why I mean so he sat on the FISA</text>
  <text start="1020.89" dur="5.52">Court and again dojo digenova is correct</text>
  <text start="1024.79" dur="3.3">I mean he probably got everything signed</text>
  <text start="1026.41" dur="3.96">and affidavits and everything was sworn</text>
  <text start="1028.09" dur="4.26">and under oath and all that based on</text>
  <text start="1030.37" dur="6.29">those he went ahead and gave the the</text>
  <text start="1032.35" dur="4.31">right to spy on trump at Trump Towers</text>
  <text start="1038.28" dur="5.8">Rogers found out about it went over</text>
  <text start="1040.75" dur="5.22">there told to the Trump Towers told told</text>
  <text start="1044.08" dur="3.92">Trump about it the next day moves out he</text>
  <text start="1045.97" dur="8.64">goes to his headquarters in New Jersey</text>
  <text start="1048" dur="8.35">and the same judge then presided over</text>
  <text start="1054.61" dur="3.42">the December first hearing where Flynn</text>
  <text start="1056.35" dur="2.73">pleaded pled guilty to lying to federal</text>
  <text start="1058.03" dur="3.989">FBI</text>
