  <text start="29.49" dur="4.68">silenced Trump and conservatives</text>
  <text start="31.41" dur="5.7">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if Twitter lifted</text>

  <text start="84.39" dur="4.86">who violate their quote Terms of Use but</text>
  <text start="87.63" dur="3.779">is this just a new method of political</text>

  <text start="96.869" dur="3.96">little bit more about it thank you for</text>
  <text start="98.31" dur="3.96">joining us good morning Heather so as we</text>
  <text start="100.829" dur="3.211">begin let&amp;#39;s take a look at some of the</text>
  <text start="102.27" dur="3.51">topics that will be involved here that</text>
  <text start="104.04" dur="4.14">would lead to this enforcement a</text>

  <text start="113.009" dur="3.75">or promoting self harm and it goes on</text>
  <text start="115.02" dur="4.02">from there but here&amp;#39;s the thing the</text>
  <text start="116.759" dur="4.29">company said you know specifically when</text>
  <text start="119.04" dur="3.689">it comes to world leaders they will not</text>
  <text start="121.049" dur="4.291">be above their policies and that</text>
  <text start="122.729" dur="5.011">Twitter&amp;#39;s global enforcement team will</text>
  <text start="125.34" dur="5.91">be responsible for determining whether</text>
  <text start="127.74" dur="4.32">something is offensive or not who is</text>
  <text start="131.25" dur="3.81">going to be doing the</text>
  <text start="132.06" dur="5.52">who&amp;#39;s gonna be on this team well we know</text>
  <text start="135.06" dur="4.14">that this is a big tech company based in</text>
  <text start="137.58" dur="3.57">California which is typically not</text>
  <text start="139.2" dur="3.24">friendly to conservatives so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="3.36">going to have their team determining</text>
  <text start="142.44" dur="3.9">whether or not they find tweets let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="144.51" dur="3.33">say from President Trump whether or not</text>
  <text start="146.34" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re offensive and even though they</text>
  <text start="147.84" dur="3.78">are saying with world leaders including</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="4.41">our president they&amp;#39;re allowed to tweet</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="5.52">things out in the sake of public</text>
  <text start="153.81" dur="4.98">interest that may be on the gray area of</text>
  <text start="157.14" dur="3.27">what their policies are they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="158.79" dur="3.54">all those followers all the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.41" dur="3.48">followers will not be able to share that</text>
  <text start="162.33" dur="3.989">won&amp;#39;t be able to retweet it so it is</text>
  <text start="163.89" dur="4.89">limiting the free speech that</text>
  <text start="166.319" dur="4.411">individuals are able to share now here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="3.48">what I will say Twitter this is their</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="3.75">platform they can make the rules that</text>
  <text start="172.26" dur="4.47">they want but there has been a history</text>
  <text start="174.48" dur="4.68">of them being very biased towards</text>
  <text start="176.73" dur="4.17">conservative voices on Twitter so that</text>
  <text start="179.16" dur="3.6">is where there is this concern of</text>
  <text start="180.9" dur="4.71">censorship and what this could possibly</text>
  <text start="182.76" dur="5.4">mean for conservative ideology exactly</text>
  <text start="185.61" dur="4.56">you know and rightly so because of the</text>
  <text start="188.16" dur="4.29">presidents have been set in the past by</text>
  <text start="190.17" dur="5.039">some of these people on these social</text>
  <text start="192.45" dur="4.56">media sites by censoring conservatives</text>
  <text start="195.209" dur="4.321">how do we know they won&amp;#39;t do it this</text>
  <text start="197.01" dur="4.74">time around they probably will and</text>
  <text start="199.53" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re allowed to do it now I do find</text>
  <text start="201.75" dur="4.23">it interesting that in many ways Twitter</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="3.87">is not making anybody happy with this</text>
  <text start="205.98" dur="3.87">decision of course conservatives are</text>
  <text start="207.72" dur="3.87">concerned about the censorship aspect</text>
  <text start="209.85" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s a very valid concern</text>
  <text start="211.59" dur="4.5">but Senator Kamala Harris has been</text>
  <text start="213.6" dur="4.56">asking Twitter to ban President Trump</text>
  <text start="216.09" dur="3.959">from their platform for quite a few</text>
  <text start="218.16" dur="4.29">weeks now they are saying no the reason</text>
  <text start="220.049" dur="4.111">why Twitter is saying no is because they</text>
  <text start="222.45" dur="3.659">know President Trump makes them a lot of</text>
  <text start="224.16" dur="3.87">money he has a huge following and of</text>
  <text start="226.109" dur="3.571">course many news outlets including Fox</text>
  <text start="228.03" dur="4.709">News like to follow his Twitter account</text>
  <text start="229.68" dur="5.16">and make news that way so nobody is</text>
  <text start="232.739" dur="4.141">really happy with this decision but in</text>
  <text start="234.84" dur="4.2">talking about how conservatives are</text>
  <text start="236.88" dur="4.05">censored even issues like pro-life</text>
  <text start="239.04" dur="3.9">there&amp;#39;s one pro-life organization called</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="4.38">live action who has been censored by</text>
  <text start="242.94" dur="4.85">Twitter saying that they are not allowed</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="5.009">to buy any ads if they continue to show</text>
  <text start="247.79" dur="4.18">ultrasounds on their Twitter account so</text>
  <text start="250.319" dur="3.39">these are the type of decisions that</text>
  <text start="251.97" dur="2.849">Twitter is making they&amp;#39;re allowed to</text>
  <text start="253.709" dur="3.09">make those decisions</text>
  <text start="254.819" dur="3.811">but as conservatives we do have to ask</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="4.141">ourselves do we want to continue to use</text>
  <text start="258.63" dur="4.05">a platform that may censor us going back</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="3.599">to what Kamala Harris has been asking</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="4.049">that President Trump be banned from the</text>
  <text start="264.539" dur="4.771">platform you know do you think this is</text>
  <text start="266.729" dur="4.711">sort of a go around for Twitter to kind</text>
  <text start="269.31" dur="5.039">of ride both sides of the fence because</text>
  <text start="271.44" dur="4.409">if you ban people or you determine a lot</text>
  <text start="274.349" dur="4.171">of the tweets that President Trump say</text>
  <text start="275.849" dur="5.611">has sent out those are offensive and you</text>
  <text start="278.52" dur="5.76">can&amp;#39;t retweet or like or respond in any</text>
  <text start="281.46" dur="5.82">way I mean that&amp;#39;s basically a form of</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="4.889">banning him absolutely this is limiting</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="3.99">the free speech that world leaders have</text>
  <text start="289.169" dur="4.111">and also those who follow those world</text>
  <text start="291.27" dur="4.709">leaders in Twitter has the right to do</text>
  <text start="293.28" dur="5.73">so but I would ask why do we not then</text>
  <text start="295.979" dur="5.25">see some progressive progressive leaders</text>
  <text start="299.01" dur="3.93">out there who do things that do violate</text>
  <text start="301.229" dur="4.111">the policy-wise them president being</text>
  <text start="302.94" dur="4.53">called out by Senator Harris and not</text>
  <text start="305.34" dur="3.84">other people for example who Leon Castro</text>
  <text start="307.47" dur="4.14">who was called out but Twitter didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="309.18" dur="4.56">anything in reference to him daxing</text>
  <text start="311.61" dur="4.739">individuals information and putting</text>
  <text start="313.74" dur="5.25">their private information out there this</text>
  <text start="316.349" dur="5.551">is where the hypocrisy comes in twitter</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="4.65">apparently they have this global entity</text>
  <text start="321.9" dur="3.24">that is going to be determining what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.64" dur="3.48">allowed and what&amp;#39;s not I just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="325.14" dur="3.75">Twitter trust Twitter to always have the</text>
  <text start="327.12" dur="3.62">right judgment all right thank you so</text>
