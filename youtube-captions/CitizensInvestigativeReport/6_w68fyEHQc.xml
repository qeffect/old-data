  <text start="211.37" dur="6.839">are the key details that you&amp;#39;re breaking</text>
  <text start="213.41" dur="6.77">here in Breitbart news daily NYPD was</text>
  <text start="218.209" dur="4.141">the first one to look at that laptop</text>
  <text start="220.18" dur="5.83">Hillary I&amp;#39;m sorry Peter</text>
  <text start="222.35" dur="5.91">and Huma Abedin his wife the closest</text>
  <text start="226.01" dur="5.4">advisor of Hillary Clinton for 20 years</text>
  <text start="228.26" dur="5.76">has both quipped okay they are</text>
  <text start="231.41" dur="5.76">cooperating with the government they</text>
  <text start="234.02" dur="9.75">both have they see potential jail time</text>
  <text start="237.17" dur="10.08">of many years for their crimes or or</text>
  <text start="243.77" dur="6.33">Huma Abedin sending and receiving and</text>
  <text start="247.25" dur="5.31">you can storing hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="250.1" dur="4.53">messages from the State Department</text>
  <text start="252.56" dur="2.37">server and from Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s own</text>
  <text start="254.63" dur="2.639">home</text>
  <text start="254.93" dur="4.38">server which which contain classified</text>
  <text start="257.269" dur="4.861">information</text>
  <text start="259.31" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re faces all kinds of exposure for</text>
  <text start="262.13" dur="3.96">the inappropriate sexting that was going</text>
  <text start="264.59" dur="5.25">on and some other information they found</text>
  <text start="266.09" dur="5.91">so NYPD first gets that computer they</text>
  <text start="269.84" dur="4.919">see how disgusting it is they keep a</text>
  <text start="272" dur="6">copy of everything and they pass a copy</text>
  <text start="274.759" dur="9.451">on to the FBI which finally pushes the</text>
  <text start="278" dur="8.43">FBI off you know off their chairs making</text>
  <text start="284.21" dur="4.56">call me reopen that investigation which</text>
  <text start="286.43" dur="6.84">was indicated in the letter last week</text>
  <text start="288.77" dur="6.24">the point being NYPD has all the</text>
  <text start="293.27" dur="5.85">information and they won&amp;#39;t they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="295.01" dur="7.68">pursue justice within their rights if</text>
  <text start="299.12" dur="5.94">the FBI doesn&amp;#39;t and there is all kinds</text>
  <text start="302.69" dur="5.909">of criminal culpability through all the</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="8.55">emails they&amp;#39;ve seen of that 650,000</text>
  <text start="308.599" dur="10.651">including money laundering underage sex</text>
  <text start="313.61" dur="8.1">a painful play and of course you know</text>
  <text start="319.25" dur="5.76">plenty of proof of inappropriate</text>
  <text start="321.71" dur="6.209">handling sending receiving of classified</text>
  <text start="325.01" dur="6.51">information up to staff level special</text>
  <text start="327.919" dur="7.801">access programs so the plot thickens</text>
  <text start="331.52" dur="6.959">NYPD was pushing because you know as a</text>
  <text start="335.72" dur="4.68">as an article just reached quoted one of</text>
  <text start="338.479" dur="5.791">the Chiefs gave us the level just below</text>
  <text start="340.4" dur="6.269">commissioner he said as a parent as a</text>
  <text start="344.27" dur="6.63">father with daughters he could not let</text>
  <text start="346.669" dur="7.981">that level of evil continue this is</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="6.06">remarkable let&amp;#39;s discuss the internal</text>
  <text start="354.65" dur="4.38">debate that seems to be happening within</text>
  <text start="356.96" dur="4.709">various law enforcement agencies right</text>
  <text start="359.03" dur="4.77">now it seems like there seems to be</text>
  <text start="361.669" dur="4.56">incredible fractionalization not just in</text>
  <text start="363.8" dur="4.14">the FBI but the NYPD as well on whether</text>
  <text start="366.229" dur="4.711">to pursue these things when to pursue</text>
  <text start="367.94" dur="5.699">them how hard to pursue them even you</text>
  <text start="370.94" dur="4.59">have to wonder about places like the the</text>
  <text start="373.639" dur="4.891">US Attorney&amp;#39;s Office of New York where</text>
  <text start="375.53" dur="4.56">you have which which seems to be a place</text>
  <text start="378.53" dur="3.629">that actually has integrity in the</text>
  <text start="380.09" dur="3.78">American justice system right now and</text>
  <text start="382.159" dur="4.041">they seem to be wanting to pursue this</text>
  <text start="383.87" dur="3.86">quite diligently</text>
  <text start="386.2" dur="2.97">yeah I can&amp;#39;t make heads or tails out of</text>
  <text start="387.73" dur="2.61">it Eric but you you&amp;#39;re much better</text>
  <text start="389.17" dur="3.69">source than I am</text>
  <text start="390.34" dur="6.21">they described some of this to chew us</text>
  <text start="392.86" dur="5.64">well again the FBI can investigate but</text>
  <text start="396.55" dur="5.16">they can&amp;#39;t convene a grand jury</text>
  <text start="398.5" dur="5.22">they can&amp;#39;t file charges okay the</text>
  <text start="401.71" dur="5.1">prosecutors the Justice Department has</text>
  <text start="403.72" dur="6.48">to do that now I understand it Preet</text>
  <text start="406.81" dur="7.08">Bharara the Manhattan prosecutor has</text>
  <text start="410.2" dur="5.58">gotten hold of some of this and what I</text>
  <text start="413.89" dur="3.93">hear he&amp;#39;s a stand-up guy and and</text>
  <text start="415.78" dur="3.81">hopefully he does the right thing yeah</text>
  <text start="417.82" dur="4.25">well and that&amp;#39;s bad news for the</text>
  <text start="419.59" dur="5.19">Clintons because he&amp;#39;s someone who has a</text>
  <text start="422.07" dur="4.12">sterling reputation he&amp;#39;s a Democrat but</text>
  <text start="424.78" dur="3.9">he&amp;#39;s a guy who&amp;#39;s had a sterling</text>
  <text start="426.19" dur="4.35">reputation of calling it like he sees it</text>
  <text start="428.68" dur="5.4">and not being bought and paid for by the</text>
  <text start="430.54" dur="5.79">special interests and he read a very</text>
  <text start="434.08" dur="4.83">tenacious guide so he is not a guy you</text>
  <text start="436.33" dur="8.19">want on on your case let&amp;#39;s put it that</text>
  <text start="438.91" dur="8.91">way certainly but yet if people are</text>
  <text start="444.52" dur="5.64">willing to bend or break the law and</text>
  <text start="447.82" dur="6.63">don&amp;#39;t really care about the Constitution</text>
  <text start="450.16" dur="5.79">or due process if you&amp;#39;re going to use if</text>
  <text start="454.45" dur="4.77">you&amp;#39;re willing to use phallus tactics</text>
  <text start="455.95" dur="4.08">against someone who knows what level of</text>
  <text start="459.22" dur="3.57">pressure</text>
  <text start="460.03" dur="5.31">the point being fortunately it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="462.79" dur="3.87">just the deal it&amp;#39;s not just the FBI five</text>
  <text start="465.34" dur="6.12">different offices that are in the hunt</text>
  <text start="466.66" dur="9.48">for jams but the NYPD has it as well but</text>
  <text start="471.46" dur="8.58">both as as The Wall Street Journal has</text>
  <text start="476.14" dur="5.82">talked about they exposed downdraft back</text>
  <text start="480.04" dur="6.45">pressure from from the Justice</text>
  <text start="481.96" dur="9.08">Department as well as NYPD has trying to</text>
  <text start="486.49" dur="8.12">keep the sunlight and the disinfecting</text>
  <text start="491.04" dur="8.05">effects of the truth and transparency</text>
  <text start="494.61" dur="7.75">from you know shining on this great evil</text>
  <text start="499.09" dur="6.93">that has gone on and is slowly being</text>
  <text start="502.36" dur="6.72">exposed so the Justice Department is</text>
  <text start="506.02" dur="6.18">trying to run out the clock to elect</text>
  <text start="509.08" dur="6.39">Hillary Clinton to prevent any little</text>
  <text start="512.2" dur="4.8">justice from being done so where&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="515.47" dur="3.21">mayor&amp;#39;s office on this we haven&amp;#39;t heard</text>
  <text start="517" dur="5.969">from Bill DeBlasio or</text>
  <text start="518.68" dur="8.909">like that from what I hear de Blasio he</text>
  <text start="522.969" dur="7.651">wants to stay away from this see the</text>
  <text start="527.589" dur="4.921">evidence is still bad the email content</text>
  <text start="530.62" dur="3.81">is so bad that I think either Jean wants</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="6.42">to stay away from it which is really</text>
  <text start="534.43" dur="6.24">telling yeah and who else is involved</text>
  <text start="538.93" dur="4.08">are there any other players that you are</text>
  <text start="540.67" dur="6.359">unexpected or in not being reported in</text>
  <text start="543.01" dur="6.389">the rest of the press not that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="547.029" dur="3.781">heard the other legislators have not</text>
  <text start="549.399" dur="3.961">been named yet</text>
  <text start="550.81" dur="6.029">I wish the NYPD would have a press</text>
  <text start="553.36" dur="6.539">conference I wish they do it today these</text>
  <text start="556.839" dur="5.731">are the these are the unusual sliding</text>
  <text start="559.899" dur="4.231">door moments of history that people can</text>
  <text start="562.57" dur="4.519">stand up and be counted</text>
  <text start="564.13" dur="4.86">and make a real difference and to save</text>
  <text start="567.089" dur="5.141">say for the public today the</text>
  <text start="568.99" dur="5.61">Constitution that we actually need and</text>
  <text start="572.23" dur="5.729">love and that are our full fathers</text>
  <text start="574.6" dur="5.94">fought and died for and for any cop that</text>
  <text start="577.959" dur="4.291">is aware of this level of law dealing</text>
  <text start="580.54" dur="3.72">and they have veterans in their family</text>
  <text start="582.25" dur="4.709">or deceased veterans in their family</text>
  <text start="584.26" dur="5.46">they owe it to them to stand up to stand</text>
  <text start="586.959" dur="5.671">up be counted today and shine the light</text>
  <text start="589.72" dur="4.65">of truth on this great evil yeah but how</text>
  <text start="592.63" dur="3.36">realistic is that gonna be at this point</text>
  <text start="594.37" dur="5.28">I mean that would just be such a a</text>
  <text start="595.99" dur="7.74">monumental bombshell from what I</text>
  <text start="599.65" dur="5.82">understand up to the Commissioner or at</text>
  <text start="603.73" dur="4.16">least the chief level in the NYPD they</text>
  <text start="605.47" dur="4.68">wanted to have a press conference in DOJ</text>
  <text start="607.89" dur="6.43">Washington people political appointees</text>
  <text start="610.15" dur="8.64">have been exerting all kinds of undue</text>
  <text start="614.32" dur="6">pressure on them to back down so and you</text>
  <text start="618.79" dur="2.82">believe this has to do with the fact</text>
  <text start="620.32" dur="2.67">that we&amp;#39;re in the middle of the of the</text>
  <text start="621.61" dur="6.2">election and people don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="622.99" dur="4.82">perceived as overly politicizing it I</text>
  <text start="629.459" dur="7.771">think that&amp;#39;s the argument for it but the</text>
  <text start="634.54" dur="6.91">fact is if</text>
  <text start="637.23" dur="7.08">you know that if the left had emails</text>
  <text start="641.45" dur="6.3">pointed Donald Trump being involved in</text>
  <text start="644.31" dur="6.21">under a visiting multiple times in</text>
  <text start="647.75" dur="5.8">Island with underage sex slaves</text>
  <text start="650.52" dur="4.59">basically emails you know they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="653.55" dur="5.7">talking about it maybe shouting it from</text>
  <text start="655.11" dur="6.27">the rooftops this kind of evil this kind</text>
  <text start="659.25" dur="5.1">of truth dirt on Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="661.38" dur="4.53">you look you don&amp;#39;t have to not to make</text>
  <text start="664.35" dur="3.81">any judgments this release</text>
  <text start="665.91" dur="4.62">emails just dump um let them out there</text>
  <text start="668.16" dur="4.44">let people see the light of truth all</text>
  <text start="670.53" dur="5.04">the noise yeah it&amp;#39;s actually worked in</text>
  <text start="672.6" dur="4.83">the past sometimes you know that tactic</text>
  <text start="675.57" dur="3.27">does work for them because what ends up</text>
  <text start="677.43" dur="4.65">happening is that they will they will</text>
  <text start="678.84" dur="4.59">declare after we&amp;#39;ve had 45 minutes to</text>
  <text start="682.08" dur="2.85">try to read through the emails they will</text>
  <text start="683.43" dur="7.05">declare that we found nothing and</text>
  <text start="684.93" dur="7.65">everyone should move on but for even you</text>
  <text start="690.48" dur="3.59">know even the claims of Podesta or Donna</text>
