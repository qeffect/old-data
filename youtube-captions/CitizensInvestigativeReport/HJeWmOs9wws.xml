  <text start="1044.829" dur="3.36">all they shouldn&amp;#39;t get a special</text>
  <text start="1046.839" dur="2.581">briefing the gang of eight at least</text>
  <text start="1048.189" dur="2.611">that&amp;#39;s we should use the gang of eight</text>
  <text start="1049.42" dur="3.06">that&amp;#39;s what it was set up for blah blah</text>
  <text start="1050.8" dur="4.17">blah okay cuz he wanted to know what was</text>
  <text start="1052.48" dur="3.9">being said okay and this was right</text>
  <text start="1054.97" dur="3.48">around the time of Trump&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="1056.38" dur="5.16">surveillance really coming out and all</text>
  <text start="1058.45" dur="4.92">this stuff really coming out so Adam</text>

  <text start="1067.46" dur="4.44">remember all that going on back then but</text>
  <text start="1069.29" dur="4.55">wasn&amp;#39;t too far long ago right around the</text>
  <text start="1071.9" dur="4.95">time of the inspector general report</text>
  <text start="1073.84" dur="5.56">right before it came out okay so they</text>
  <text start="1076.85" dur="5.37">were they were briefed as well and this</text>
  <text start="1079.4" dur="6">is why Devin Nunez wants this</text>
  <text start="1082.22" dur="4.709">information to come come out because he</text>
  <text start="1085.4" dur="4.68">claimed the Inspector General report</text>
  <text start="1086.929" dur="5.761">completely redo bumped what Adam Schiff</text>
  <text start="1090.08" dur="5.58">said so cuz the gang of eight Adam</text>
  <text start="1092.69" dur="5.369">shifty shifty shift claimed it was</text>
  <text start="1095.66" dur="6.509">nonsense to claim there was a spy in the</text>
  <text start="1098.059" dur="5.821">Trump campaign okay so so definiteness</text>
  <text start="1102.169" dur="4.051">wants all that information to come out</text>
  <text start="1103.88" dur="5.46">to prove what a big fat liar out of</text>
  <text start="1106.22" dur="5.22">shift is I call him shifty shift okay</text>
  <text start="1109.34" dur="3.69">so let&amp;#39;s hear let&amp;#39;s hear what he says so</text>

  <text start="1120.29" dur="7.2">all right here we go ready go good</text>
  <text start="1125.63" dur="3.48">afternoon I won&amp;#39;t be able to take any</text>
  <text start="1127.49" dur="4.23">questions today but I&amp;#39;ve been asked to</text>
  <text start="1129.11" dur="5.069">read a brief statement on behalf of</text>

  <text start="1139.4" dur="5.04">sources and methods noting we heard</text>
  <text start="1141.919" dur="4.89">today has changed our view that there is</text>
  <text start="1144.44" dur="5.369">no evidence to support any allegation</text>
  <text start="1146.809" dur="5.761">that the FBI or any Intelligence Agency</text>
  <text start="1149.809" dur="4.981">placed a spy in the Trump campaign or</text>
  <text start="1152.57" dur="7.25">otherwise failed to follow appropriate</text>
  <text start="1154.79" dur="5.03">procedures and protocols thank you</text>
  <text start="1163.28" dur="4.92">however I think the American people are</text>
  <text start="1165.47" dur="4.709">beginning to see what it is that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1168.2" dur="5.82">been after for a very long time and that</text>
  <text start="1170.179" dur="6.091">is is is it common or does it ever</text>
  <text start="1174.02" dur="4.59">happen that the counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="1176.27" dur="4.47">agencies or capabilities of this country</text>
  <text start="1178.61" dur="4.29">are they used to target political</text>
  <text start="1180.74" dur="3.12">campaigns we need to know that answer</text>
  <text start="1182.9" dur="2.519">now I know the Democrats have been</text>
  <text start="1183.86" dur="4.41">hiding because they&amp;#39;re so married to</text>
  <text start="1185.419" dur="4.201">this to this Russia gate Fiasco that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1188.27" dur="3.899">been going on for so long</text>
  <text start="1189.62" dur="4.98">but I would think most of the American</text>
  <text start="1192.169" dur="5.161">people including most people in politics</text>
  <text start="1194.6" dur="5.55">would be very very worried if the FBI</text>
  <text start="1197.33" dur="5.82">and others are running informants into</text>
  <text start="1200.15" dur="4.71">our campaigns very simple question it</text>
  <text start="1203.15" dur="3.33">deserves a very simple answer we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1204.86" dur="5.13">asking that question for many many</text>
  <text start="1206.48" dur="5.28">months and you know on Friday we thought</text>
  <text start="1209.99" dur="2.88">we had a meeting Friday morning we</text>
  <text start="1211.76" dur="3.69">thought that everything was going to</text>
  <text start="1212.87" dur="4.95">come together but then as you all know</text>
  <text start="1215.45" dur="5.03">we received a letter almost at midnight</text>
  <text start="1217.82" dur="4.53">Friday night which is a textbook swampy</text>
  <text start="1220.48" dur="4.059">example of what they do here in</text>

  <text start="1226.58" dur="4.969">till nearly stroke of midnight well you</text>
  <text start="1229.7" dur="5.28">know congressman that there have been</text>
  <text start="1231.549" dur="6.37">the DOJ has been sending out email you</text>
  <text start="1234.98" dur="4.949">know press blasts we cooperated there</text>
  <text start="1237.919" dur="4.26">are a couple of things we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1239.929" dur="3.841">speeding up document production we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1242.179" dur="5.13">doing everything Congress wants us to do</text>
  <text start="1243.77" dur="5.149">but you say that it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="1247.309" dur="5.041">suspicious that there are just a few</text>
  <text start="1248.919" dur="5.411">documents that could lay bare all of</text>
  <text start="1252.35" dur="4.28">your questions and those are the ones</text>
  <text start="1254.33" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep from you the most</text>
  <text start="1256.63" dur="4.779">yeah and let&amp;#39;s be let&amp;#39;s be clear there</text>
  <text start="1259.94" dur="5.28">were many documents that they provided</text>
  <text start="1261.409" dur="5.701">last week okay now now those should have</text>
  <text start="1265.22" dur="3.48">been provided to us months and months</text>
  <text start="1267.11" dur="3.809">and months ago but we&amp;#39;ll get past that</text>
  <text start="1268.7" dur="3.15">so I would say we cleaned up most of</text>
  <text start="1270.919" dur="2.88">what was on the table</text>
  <text start="1271.85" dur="5.28">except for the most important piece</text>
  <text start="1273.799" dur="5.521">which is where there&amp;#39;s two pieces really</text>
  <text start="1277.13" dur="4.14">but one is you can&amp;#39;t use gang of eight</text>
  <text start="1279.32" dur="3.719">you can&amp;#39;t take information that our</text>
  <text start="1281.27" dur="4.68">investigators and our committee members</text>
  <text start="1283.039" dur="4.531">found and then retroactively lycée no no</text>
  <text start="1285.95" dur="4.26">sorry Congress we&amp;#39;re going to move that</text>
  <text start="1287.57" dur="4.2">so only the leaders in Congress can see</text>
  <text start="1290.21" dur="3">this information when it&amp;#39;s information</text>
  <text start="1291.77" dur="2.85">that we dug up so we&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="1293.21" dur="3.32">handle that today we&amp;#39;re gonna meet with</text>
  <text start="1294.62" dur="3.59">the Director of National Intelligence</text>
  <text start="1296.53" dur="3.78">hopefully we get somewhere on that issue</text>
  <text start="1298.21" dur="4.23">the second and bigger issue goes to the</text>
  <text start="1300.31" dur="4.47">one we were just discussing which is did</text>
  <text start="1302.44" dur="5.76">you or did you not run informants into</text>
  <text start="1304.78" dur="5.37">the Trump campaign especially before the</text>
  <text start="1308.2" dur="3.6">investigation even began so remember</text>
  <text start="1310.15" dur="3.48">just take people back how did this</text>
  <text start="1311.8" dur="3.27">investigation begin according to the New</text>
  <text start="1313.63" dur="3.84">York Times and many others in the</text>
  <text start="1315.07" dur="4.32">mainstream media well you had the the</text>
  <text start="1317.47" dur="4.74">dump of the emails the Democratic</text>
  <text start="1319.39" dur="5.13">National Committee emails in late July</text>
  <text start="1322.21" dur="4.26">and then oh my gosh our great friend</text>
  <text start="1324.52" dur="3.72">from Australia gave us five eyes</text>
  <text start="1326.47" dur="4.35">intelligence so that we could open up</text>
  <text start="1328.24" dur="4.77">this investigation well as you know from</text>
  <text start="1330.82" dur="3.69">a couple months ago that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="1333.01" dur="3.21">there there was no five eyes</text>
  <text start="1334.51" dur="3.42">intelligence product that was used it</text>
  <text start="1336.22" dur="3.39">was it was ran through the State</text>
  <text start="1337.93" dur="3.18">Department we now know that from State</text>
  <text start="1339.61" dur="3.63">Department people who still need to be</text>
  <text start="1341.11" dur="3.24">interviewed who are now out there</text>
  <text start="1343.24" dur="3.21">talking to their friends in the</text>
  <text start="1344.35" dur="4.38">mainstream media they say they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="1346.45" dur="4.68">ones that got that information to the</text>
  <text start="1348.73" dur="4.41">FBI so that would be totally irregular</text>
  <text start="1351.13" dur="3.66">how you open this investigation in the</text>
  <text start="1353.14" dur="3.84">first place but what people are ignoring</text>
  <text start="1354.79" dur="4.98">is well wait a second what if that</text>
  <text start="1356.98" dur="4.2">story&amp;#39;s not true mm-hmm or what if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1359.77" dur="3.06">only half true because I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1361.18" dur="3.24">parts of that story that are true but I</text>
  <text start="1362.83" dur="3.51">think there&amp;#39;s a whole lot that we still</text>
  <text start="1364.42" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t know about and that really gets</text>
  <text start="1366.34" dur="4.05">down to look did you use the</text>
  <text start="1368.77" dur="3.96">counterintelligence capability of this</text>
  <text start="1370.39" dur="5.07">country to run informants or spies or</text>
  <text start="1372.73" dur="6.57">whatever you want to call them into the</text>
  <text start="1375.46" dur="6.24">Trump campaign before that date now</text>
  <text start="1379.3" dur="5.46">and I would say furthermore are you are</text>
  <text start="1381.7" dur="5.37">you running spies into other like Senate</text>
  <text start="1384.76" dur="3.75">campaigns or House members campaigns I</text>
  <text start="1387.07" dur="2.94">mean it&amp;#39;s just a practice that you guys</text>
  <text start="1388.51" dur="3.6">have been using for many years I mean</text>
  <text start="1390.01" dur="4.59">this needs to be cleared up this is this</text>
  <text start="1392.11" dur="5.22">is very the Department of Justice is an</text>
  <text start="1394.6" dur="3.96">FBI are on a very slippery slope because</text>
  <text start="1397.33" dur="3.12">because we need to keep these</text>
  <text start="1398.56" dur="4.59">capabilities to track down terrorists</text>
  <text start="1400.45" dur="4.89">but I will tell you that there are I bet</text>
  <text start="1403.15" dur="4.05">you wouldn&amp;#39;t find one vote on the</text>
  <text start="1405.34" dur="3.93">Republican side today to keep these</text>
  <text start="1407.2" dur="4.17">capabilities in place have you talked to</text>
  <text start="1409.27" dur="4.56">anyone that worked for the FBI at that</text>
  <text start="1411.37" dur="4.32">time or DOJ that does have some</text>
  <text start="1413.83" dur="3.33">information and knows exactly what</text>
  <text start="1415.69" dur="2.9">they&amp;#39;re trying to hide and why they</text>
  <text start="1417.16" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t want to turn over those documents</text>
  <text start="1418.59" dur="4.78">well I think if you look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1420.97" dur="5.49">publicly available for example you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1423.37" dur="5.46">seen that you know that Roger stone</text>
  <text start="1426.46" dur="5.25">and my Caputo both amended their</text>
  <text start="1428.83" dur="4.98">testimony a little over a week ago to</text>
  <text start="1431.71" dur="4.77">our committee where they claimed that</text>
  <text start="1433.81" dur="6.72">they were approached by somebody by some</text>
  <text start="1436.48" dur="6.69">type of FBI informant in the May of 2016</text>
  <text start="1440.53" dur="4.98">timeframe now we have they make that</text>
  <text start="1443.17" dur="3.78">claim they&amp;#39;ve amended their testimony to</text>
  <text start="1445.51" dur="3.09">make that claim so I mean that would be</text>
  <text start="1446.95" dur="3.03">under the penalty of lying to Congress</text>
  <text start="1448.6" dur="3.75">so I assume that they&amp;#39;re they believe</text>
  <text start="1449.98" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re telling the truth so why can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1452.35" dur="2.97">the FBI just tell us if that really</text>
  <text start="1454.03" dur="2.91">happened or not it&amp;#39;s real simple</text>
  <text start="1455.32" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s a congressman what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1456.94" dur="4.56">suggesting is these stories that we have</text>
  <text start="1458.98" dur="4.29">now heard about that Professor these</text>
  <text start="1461.5" dur="3.93">stories as well it sounds like people</text>
  <text start="1463.27" dur="3.84">just kind of out of nowhere present</text>
  <text start="1465.43" dur="3.75">themselves in front of the members of</text>
  <text start="1467.11" dur="5.1">the Trump campaign and try to engage</text>
  <text start="1469.18" dur="6.62">them before we knew any of this stuff</text>
  <text start="1472.21" dur="6.48">was going on and a number of people a</text>
  <text start="1475.8" dur="5.71">number of people in your circles say it</text>
  <text start="1478.69" dur="5.64">looks like they were trying to frame the</text>
  <text start="1481.51" dur="5.13">campaign yeah so so what do we know</text>
  <text start="1484.33" dur="4.77">right let&amp;#39;s go back to a couple of major</text>
  <text start="1486.64" dur="3.96">points Christopher steel was hired by</text>
  <text start="1489.1" dur="4.02">the Democratic Party in the Hillary</text>
  <text start="1490.6" dur="5.64">Clinton campaign to dig up dirt and put</text>
  <text start="1493.12" dur="6">it into a dossier on Donald Trump and</text>
  <text start="1496.24" dur="5.24">his associates that makes its way to the</text>
  <text start="1499.12" dur="7.08">FBI State Department all over the place</text>
  <text start="1501.48" dur="7.18">in in about June right June July August</text>
  <text start="1506.2" dur="4.71">timeframe that&amp;#39;s happening at the same</text>
  <text start="1508.66" dur="4.53">time now it appears you have multiple</text>
  <text start="1510.91" dur="5.01">people in about a six-week period from</text>
  <text start="1513.19" dur="5.49">April to June where you have multiple</text>
  <text start="1515.92" dur="5.34">people that are that are making offers</text>
  <text start="1518.68" dur="6.21">of selling some type of dirt on Hillary</text>
  <text start="1521.26" dur="5.28">Clinton from Russia to to the Trump</text>
  <text start="1524.89" dur="3.03">campaign now look maybe some of those</text>
  <text start="1526.54" dur="2.76">are just people that want to make some</text>
  <text start="1527.92" dur="4.17">money and are really just making things</text>
  <text start="1529.3" dur="5.37">up like Christopher Steele or maybe the</text>
  <text start="1532.09" dur="4.71">FBI was running bringing people in or or</text>
  <text start="1534.67" dur="4.02">some other agency we have no idea but we</text>
  <text start="1536.8" dur="3.84">have a right to know that this is a</text>
  <text start="1538.69" dur="3.48">legitimate investigation those are the</text>
  <text start="1540.64" dur="3.45">questions you want answered we saw a</text>
  <text start="1542.17" dur="3.96">statement caught our mind from a</text>
  <text start="1544.09" dur="4.05">fundraiser recently it was a part of</text>
  <text start="1546.13" dur="3.96">that gang of eight who gets to see more</text>
  <text start="1548.14" dur="2.55">special intelligence is Senator Mark</text>
  <text start="1550.09" dur="3.24">Warner</text>
  <text start="1550.69" dur="3.9">he is purported to have said this at a</text>
  <text start="1553.33" dur="4.08">fundraiser</text>
  <text start="1554.59" dur="5.28">he said if you get me one more glass of</text>
  <text start="1557.41" dur="4.92">wine I&amp;#39;ll tell you stuff only bye</text>
  <text start="1559.87" dur="4.38">Muller and I know if you think we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="1564.25" dur="4.8">so far buckle up it&amp;#39;s going to be a wild</text>
  <text start="1565.96" dur="4.92">couple of months does Senator Mark</text>
  <text start="1569.05" dur="4.17">Warner know something you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1570.88" dur="5.19">is it time to buckle up well you know</text>
  <text start="1573.22" dur="6.03">senator Warner has a very interesting</text>
  <text start="1576.07" dur="4.62">history here including you know coming</text>
  <text start="1579.25" dur="3.09">over to the house side with secret</text>
  <text start="1580.69" dur="2.94">meetings complaining about the House</text>
  <text start="1582.34" dur="3.08">Intelligence Committee and me</text>
  <text start="1583.63" dur="5.19">specifically to the Speaker of the House</text>
  <text start="1585.42" dur="6.01">so yeah he says a lot of wild things</text>
  <text start="1588.82" dur="5.31">I wouldn&amp;#39;t put much stock in it he seems</text>
  <text start="1591.43" dur="4.86">to be one of the guys who who was really</text>
  <text start="1594.13" dur="3.75">dug in deep maybe he knew things from</text>
  <text start="1596.29" dur="2.91">Christopher Steele and others because it</text>
  <text start="1597.88" dur="2.94">appears like you know they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1599.2" dur="3.21">connected right I&amp;#39;m the Democrats and</text>
  <text start="1600.82" dur="3.989">the Hillary Clinton campaign hired</text>
  <text start="1602.41" dur="4.59">Christopher Steele I was I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="1604.809" dur="4.62">and we know that that Harry Reid yeah</text>
  <text start="1607" dur="5.88">seems like he knew about this before he</text>
  <text start="1609.429" dur="5.311">left the Senate back in 2016 so I I</text>
  <text start="1612.88" dur="3.27">don&amp;#39;t know what Warner knows but you</text>
  <text start="1614.74" dur="7.88">know you guys can call him maybe he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1616.15" dur="8.49">interview for one glass of wine yeah</text>
  <text start="1622.62" dur="3.55">hopefully as long as it was good</text>
  <text start="1624.64" dur="5.039">California wine then it would be all</text>
  <text start="1626.17" dur="6.96">right congressman I know I played pretty</text>
  <text start="1629.679" dur="5.011">big piece of that but I think it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1633.13" dur="3.48">important to go back and listen to what</text>
  <text start="1634.69" dur="4.71">they say in retrospect knowing what we</text>
  <text start="1636.61" dur="4.74">know now that there was these gang of</text>
  <text start="1639.4" dur="4.8">eight people who are hiding the</text>
  <text start="1641.35" dur="4.47">information it&amp;#39;s so crazy okay they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1644.2" dur="3.479">all corrupt I&amp;#39;m just telling you I could</text>

  <text start="1647.679" dur="5.071">sure there&amp;#39;s and maybe I will at some</text>
  <text start="1649.21" dur="5.13">point but you know this was fallout from</text>
  <text start="1652.75" dur="4.429">the IG report which came out shortly</text>
  <text start="1654.34" dur="4.17">after that gang of eight meeting okay</text>
  <text start="1657.179" dur="5.831">excuse me</text>

  <text start="1663.01" dur="6">why good lot is asking for all documents</text>
  <text start="1666.429" dur="5.071">and communications shared with the gang</text>
  <text start="1669.01" dur="4.2">of eight in May 2018 related that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1671.5" dur="3.99">the Democrats are freaking out</text>
  <text start="1673.21" dur="3.599">because they know they lied when Adam</text>

  <text start="1685" dur="4.23">classified he can&amp;#39;t share it so when you</text>
  <text start="1687.67" dur="4.08">got to listen to real carefully when he</text>
  <text start="1689.23" dur="4.02">says well maybe the FBI did do this and</text>
  <text start="1691.75" dur="3.87">maybe they had battle of the law</text>
  <text start="1693.25" dur="6.42">he&amp;#39;s telling us without telling us okay</text>

  <text start="2043.07" dur="4.609">specifically where the greatest risk and</text>

  <text start="2077.99" dur="4.49">perspective of leverage Rosenstein is</text>
  <text start="2080.089" dur="5.01">key because he created a special counsel</text>

  <text start="2118.67" dur="4.17">Mueller Mueller will be restrained this</text>
  <text start="2120.98" dur="3.57">may explain why we are now seeing key</text>

  <text start="2124.55" dur="3.48">returning to their old jobs the</text>
  <text start="2126.38" dur="3.87">importance of this is that Muller has</text>
