  <text start="3433.96" dur="6.93">but the legitimacy of that investigation</text>
  <text start="3438.45" dur="4.72">it certainly raises a lot of questions</text>
  <text start="3440.89" dur="3.69">that need to be answered I do not</text>
  <text start="3443.17" dur="3.81">understand how they could have</text>

  <text start="3457.6" dur="4.05">command and Department of Justice to be</text>
  <text start="3459.43" dur="4.95">involved so they were part of some kind</text>
  <text start="3461.65" dur="4.459">of small group that was in on all of it</text>

  <text start="3487.2" dur="6.99">pages of evidence in the case to you I</text>
  <text start="3491.7" dur="4.53">mean it&amp;#39;s unbelievable to me that in</text>
  <text start="3494.19" dur="4.679">just two weeks ago they finally caught</text>
  <text start="3496.23" dur="4.289">this stuff up and yet at the same time</text>
  <text start="3498.869" dur="4.47">they claim it&amp;#39;s not exculpatory</text>

  <text start="3505.97" dur="7.029">distinguish exculpatory from inculpatory</text>
  <text start="3510.589" dur="4.331">well I think as a matter of general</text>
  <text start="3512.999" dur="4.05">principle dealing with prosecutors as</text>
  <text start="3514.92" dur="4.169">long as I have now particularly in the</text>
  <text start="3517.049" dur="4.32">last 20 years when the entire standard</text>

  <text start="3525.96" dur="4.5">to the defense that&amp;#39;s why the Supreme</text>
  <text start="3528.269" dur="3.961">Court in augurs said the prosecutors</text>
  <text start="3530.46" dur="3.48">shouldn&amp;#39;t attack too close to the wind</text>
  <text start="3532.23" dur="4.2">if they do they need to hand it over</text>
  <text start="3533.94" dur="5.639">because only the defense can really</text>

  <text start="3541.349" dur="3.93">what all the defenses are I mean this</text>

  <text start="3545.279" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s wrong with our criminal justice</text>

  <text start="3554.4" dur="3.839">judge Sullivan and he was the judicial</text>
  <text start="3556.019" dur="4.47">hero of my book is because he was</text>

  <text start="3562.559" dur="5.071">favorable to the defense you know all of</text>
  <text start="3564.93" dur="5.399">this arises because Michael Flynn agreed</text>
