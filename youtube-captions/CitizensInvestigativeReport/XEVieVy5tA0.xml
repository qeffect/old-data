  <text start="105.65" dur="4.86">good evening and welcome to tucker</text>
  <text start="107.73" dur="6.84">carlson tonight looking back January of</text>
  <text start="110.51" dur="5.8">2017 seems like another age so much has</text>
  <text start="114.57" dur="3.81">happened in the years since then but in</text>
  <text start="116.31" dur="3.39">other ways not that much has changed at</text>
  <text start="118.38" dur="3.96">all Donald Trump had not even taken the</text>
  <text start="119.7" dur="5.46">oath of office yet but by the first week</text>
  <text start="122.34" dur="4.8">of the new year of 2017 in case you</text>
  <text start="125.16" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t remember permanent Washington had</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="3.92">already committed to destroying his</text>
  <text start="128.82" dur="4.74">presidency and Trump seemed to know it a</text>
  <text start="131.06" dur="5.95">little after 8:00 p.m. on the night of</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="7.08">January 3rd 2017 the president-elect</text>
  <text start="137.01" dur="5.46">wrote a tweet he took a veiled dig at US</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="4.07">intelligence agencies for their handling</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="5.16">of the then newly initiated Russia</text>
  <text start="144.71" dur="5.23">investigation and pretty much the same</text>
  <text start="147.63" dur="5.31">moment Senator Chuck Schumer of New York</text>
  <text start="149.94" dur="5.97">was arriving at MSNBC&amp;#39;s midtown</text>
  <text start="152.94" dur="4.71">Manhattan Studios he went to the set and</text>
  <text start="155.91" dur="3.81">the anchor of the show he was on that</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="5.16">night Rachel Maddow pulled up Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="159.72" dur="4.89">tweet on a screen live on TV and as</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="4.38">Chuck Schumer to comment on that tweet</text>
  <text start="164.61" dur="3.93">now sure hadn&amp;#39;t seen the tweet before of</text>
  <text start="167.19" dur="3.54">course he couldn&amp;#39;t have known it was</text>
  <text start="168.54" dur="4.89">coming for one of the most calculating</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="5.61">politicians in Washington it was a rare</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="5.85">unscripted moment and so for the first</text>
  <text start="176.34" dur="4.98">time in a long time Chuck Schumer just</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="5.04">went with the unvarnished truth watch</text>
  <text start="181.32" dur="4.889">what he said think so in a day you take</text>
  <text start="184.32" dur="4.02">on the intelligence community they have</text>
  <text start="186.209" dur="5.431">six ways from Sunday at getting back at</text>
  <text start="188.34" dur="5.429">you so even for a practical supposedly</text>
  <text start="191.64" dur="5.91">hard-nosed businessman he&amp;#39;s being really</text>
  <text start="193.769" dur="5.821">dumb to do this so Schumer went on to</text>
  <text start="197.55" dur="4.05">say he didn&amp;#39;t know exactly what the spy</text>
  <text start="199.59" dur="4.02">agencies would do to Donald Trump as</text>
  <text start="201.6" dur="4.83">punishment for being dumb enough to</text>
  <text start="203.61" dur="4.92">criticize them in public but he warned</text>
  <text start="206.43" dur="5.339">and this is a verbatim quote from what I</text>
  <text start="208.53" dur="5.37">am told they are very upset about how he</text>
  <text start="211.769" dur="6.151">has treated them and talked about them</text>
  <text start="213.9" dur="6.619">in quote very upset got it there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="217.92" dur="5.25">mistaking what that was that&amp;#39;s a threat</text>
  <text start="220.519" dur="4.901">issued on live television with grave</text>
  <text start="223.17" dur="3.84">seriousness by a politician who&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="225.42" dur="4.44">in Washington long enough to know that</text>
  <text start="227.01" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s absolutely real in the end Donald</text>
  <text start="229.86" dur="4.41">Trump ignored it or more likely he</text>
  <text start="231.54" dur="4.05">decided to defy it day after day he gave</text>
  <text start="234.27" dur="2.85">the finger to the permit</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="3.27">Washington establishment often on</text>
  <text start="237.12" dur="4.71">Twitter sometimes at press conferences</text>
  <text start="238.86" dur="5.25">but always with unmistakable relish</text>
  <text start="241.83" dur="4.68">Trump acted like a man who&amp;#39;d won an</text>
  <text start="244.11" dur="3.93">election in a democratic country he</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="3.75">seemed to feel free to say exactly what</text>
  <text start="248.04" dur="3.839">he really thought he didn&amp;#39;t appear to</text>
  <text start="250.26" dur="4.32">believe that the intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="251.879" dur="3.991">had veto power over his agenda in a</text>
  <text start="254.58" dur="4.92">thousand different ways the new</text>
  <text start="255.87" dur="5.91">president refused to bow and for that</text>
  <text start="259.5" dur="4.08">prime more than any other crime he was</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="4.35">punished most recently by the</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="4.05">manufactured Ukraine scandal the Intel</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="4.02">world meanwhile has become increasingly</text>
  <text start="267.63" dur="4.32">defiant just yesterday former CIA</text>
  <text start="270.15" dur="4.14">director John Brennan expressed outrage</text>
  <text start="271.95" dur="3.96">that anyone would dare impose oversight</text>
  <text start="274.29" dur="4.08">on the intelligence agencies that</text>
  <text start="275.91" dur="4.02">secretly oversee our lives I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="278.37" dur="4.17">supposedly going to be interviewed by</text>
  <text start="279.93" dur="5.22">mr. doar as part of this non</text>
  <text start="282.54" dur="3.93">investigation I member William Barr you</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="3.3">know when he was testify in front of</text>
  <text start="286.47" dur="3.449">Congress he said he he didn&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="288.45" dur="3">the predication of the</text>
  <text start="289.919" dur="3.091">counterintelligence investigation that</text>
  <text start="291.45" dur="4.11">was launched into Russia&amp;#39;s interference</text>
  <text start="293.01" dur="5.49">in 2016 election I don&amp;#39;t understand the</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="5.25">predication of this worldwide effort to</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="4.35">try to uncover dirt either real or</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="5.04">imagined that would discredit that</text>
  <text start="302.85" dur="6.15">investigation in 2016 and into Russian</text>
  <text start="305.85" dur="5.879">interference John Brennan is a naked</text>
  <text start="309" dur="4.229">partisan he&amp;#39;s a liar he&amp;#39;s acted in ways</text>
  <text start="311.729" dur="3.901">that would have shocked and horrified</text>
  <text start="313.229" dur="2.731">previous CI directors and that&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="315.63" dur="2.969">a lot</text>
  <text start="315.96" dur="4.769">but John Brennan is not ashamed far from</text>
  <text start="318.599" dur="4.921">it he&amp;#39;s proud and so are his many</text>
  <text start="320.729" dur="4.62">acolytes in Washington Phil Mudd is a</text>
  <text start="323.52" dur="3.93">former CIA employee like so many</text>
  <text start="325.349" dur="5.25">partisans from intelligence world he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="327.45" dur="5.37">now a contributor at CNN last night Mudd</text>
  <text start="330.599" dur="5.281">said an on-air warning to the president</text>
  <text start="332.82" dur="6.029">and his lawyer back off or prepare to</text>
  <text start="335.88" dur="4.74">get hurt I spent a lot of time in</text>
  <text start="338.849" dur="3.721">government there are State Department</text>
  <text start="340.62" dur="4.769">officials who will testify Intel guys</text>
  <text start="342.57" dur="4.08">DoD Department of Defense people all of</text>
  <text start="345.389" dur="4.141">us are sort of a brotherhood and</text>

  <text start="349.53" dur="4.62">from Mars the people who will testify</text>
  <text start="352.289" dur="3.75">are going to look at him including State</text>
  <text start="354.15" dur="4.11">Department officials and say I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="356.039" dur="4.411">have to protect that guy he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="358.26" dur="3.69">operate by the rules he didn&amp;#39;t do what</text>
  <text start="360.45" dur="4.29">you&amp;#39;re supposed to do in government I</text>
  <text start="361.95" dur="4.8">suspect he&amp;#39;s worried about what the</text>
  <text start="364.74" dur="3.479">Congress will do if I were him I&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="366.75" dur="2.2">worried about whether people in</text>

  <text start="368.95" dur="6.33">Shivan his back he&amp;#39;s in trouble so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.09" dur="3.81">a brotherhood says Phil Mudd this year a</text>
  <text start="375.28" dur="4.41">Brotherhood that will stab you to death</text>
  <text start="376.9" dur="4.89">if you disobey what Phil Mudd is</text>
  <text start="379.69" dur="4.14">describing is not a conventional</text>
  <text start="381.79" dur="3.6">government agency it&amp;#39;s nothing like what</text>
  <text start="383.83" dur="4.44">most of us imagine when we think what</text>
  <text start="385.39" dur="5.25">Washington is doing on our behalf the</text>
  <text start="388.27" dur="4.62">CIA of John Brennan and Phil Mudd does</text>
  <text start="390.64" dur="3.75">not exist for our benefit it exists</text>
  <text start="392.89" dur="3.72">solely for the benefit of the people who</text>
  <text start="394.39" dur="3.93">work there we pay for the whole thing</text>
  <text start="396.61" dur="4.26">but they do what they want and they</text>
  <text start="398.32" dur="5.52">punish anyone who criticizes them they</text>
  <text start="400.87" dur="4.62">brag about that now that&amp;#39;s scary of</text>
  <text start="403.84" dur="3.15">course it&amp;#39;s a perversion of democracy</text>
  <text start="405.49" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s exactly what the people who created</text>
  <text start="406.99" dur="4.01">the CIA feared most but it&amp;#39;s also if</text>
  <text start="409.78" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re gonna be honest it&amp;#39;s annoying</text>
  <text start="411" dur="6.18">because for all of the height the CIA in</text>
  <text start="413.68" dur="6">the end isn&amp;#39;t even very good at its job</text>
  <text start="417.18" dur="6.13">now remember this is an Intelligence</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="7.56">Agency so it&amp;#39;s fair to judge their</text>
  <text start="423.31" dur="7.17">performance against whether or not they</text>
  <text start="427.24" dur="5.04">predicted crucial events over the past</text>
  <text start="430.48" dur="4.11">70 years and again and again</text>
  <text start="432.28" dur="3.93">they didn&amp;#39;t the CIA for example was</text>
  <text start="434.59" dur="3.87">shocked by the Korean War</text>
  <text start="436.21" dur="4.5">it didn&amp;#39;t predict the Soviet atomic bomb</text>
  <text start="438.46" dur="3.99">not a small thing it missed the Cuban</text>
  <text start="440.71" dur="4.86">Missile Crisis in the 1973 arab-israeli</text>
  <text start="442.45" dur="5.43">war it spent decades trying to bring</text>
  <text start="445.57" dur="4.2">down Fidel Castro to kill Fidel Castro</text>
  <text start="447.88" dur="4.32">so naturally his regime never fell</text>
  <text start="449.77" dur="4.44">Castro lived into his 90s meanwhile the</text>
  <text start="452.2" dur="2.7">CIA spent decades propping up the Shah</text>
  <text start="454.21" dur="3.27">of Iran</text>
  <text start="454.9" dur="3.87">so naturally he tumbled from power they</text>
  <text start="457.48" dur="2.82">didn&amp;#39;t even provide a warning before</text>
  <text start="458.77" dur="3.48">that happened because they had no idea</text>
  <text start="460.3" dur="4.26">it was going to happen when the Iron</text>
  <text start="462.25" dur="4.68">Curtain finally fell in 1989 the CIA was</text>
  <text start="464.56" dur="4.17">completely blindsided by it they thought</text>
  <text start="466.93" dur="4.01">they had just predicted it in fact the</text>
  <text start="468.73" dur="4.83">Soviet Union was as strong as ever and</text>
  <text start="470.94" dur="4.36">things didn&amp;#39;t get better after that the</text>
  <text start="473.56" dur="3.84">CIA had no idea that Saddam Hussein</text>
  <text start="475.3" dur="4.38">planned to invade Kuwait the next year</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="4.32">in 1990 they were totally surprised by</text>
  <text start="479.68" dur="5.19">India&amp;#39;s atomic bomb test eight years</text>
  <text start="481.72" dur="4.89">later by 2003 they were totally</text>
  <text start="484.87" dur="4.08">confident that Iraq had weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="486.61" dur="3.69">destruction in fact their biggest</text>
  <text start="488.95" dur="4.08">success in the past 50 years may have</text>
  <text start="490.3" dur="4.02">been creating the Taliban if John</text>
  <text start="493.03" dur="3.66">Brennan had been working for a</text>
  <text start="494.32" dur="4.47">non-profit business there would have</text>
  <text start="496.69" dur="3.96">been a shareholder revolt a long time</text>
  <text start="498.79" dur="3.18">ago and probably criminal charges he</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="3.48">would have been John DeLorean</text>
  <text start="501.97" dur="4.86">but because it&amp;#39;s a secretive government</text>
  <text start="504.13" dur="4.77">agency the CIA has not been restrained</text>
  <text start="506.83" dur="4.71">in fact it&amp;#39;s only become more powerful</text>
  <text start="508.9" dur="5.79">and more autonomous powerful enough to</text>
  <text start="511.54" dur="5.129">take down a president we&amp;#39;ll see one</text>
  <text start="514.69" dur="3.719">reason that permanent Washington is so</text>
  <text start="516.669" dur="3.601">powerful of course so resistant to</text>
  <text start="518.409" dur="3.361">change your oversight is that it makes</text>
  <text start="520.27" dur="3.48">alliances with some of the least</text>
  <text start="521.77" dur="4.35">impressive but most ambitious members of</text>
  <text start="523.75" dur="3.72">Congress just days ago for example House</text>
  <text start="526.12" dur="3.45">Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff</text>
  <text start="527.47" dur="4.37">claimed his office had no content</text>
  <text start="529.57" dur="4.5">whatsoever with the CIA whistleblower</text>
  <text start="531.84" dur="5.2">first off have you heard from the</text>
  <text start="534.07" dur="4.23">whistleblower are you do want to hear</text>
  <text start="537.04" dur="2.85">from the whistleblower we have not</text>
  <text start="538.3" dur="5.88">spoken directly with the whistleblower</text>
  <text start="539.89" dur="5.88">we would like to shift also claims to</text>
  <text start="544.18" dur="3.63">know nothing about what was in the</text>
  <text start="545.77" dur="3.93">whistleblowers complaint before it came</text>
  <text start="547.81" dur="3.45">out but yesterday the New York Times</text>
  <text start="549.7" dur="4.95">revealed that both those claims relies</text>
  <text start="551.26" dur="5.19">Schiff apologized in a way saying that</text>
  <text start="554.65" dur="4.92">he quote should have been much more</text>
  <text start="556.45" dur="4.44">clear write Schiff now admits his office</text>
  <text start="559.57" dur="2.94">spoke to the whistleblower who by the</text>
  <text start="560.89" dur="4.47">way we learned tonight is a registered</text>
  <text start="562.51" dur="4.92">Democrat but insists his office did</text>
  <text start="565.36" dur="3.84">nothing to shape the complaint itself</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="3.33">but why would we believe that at this</text>
