  <text start="6.66" dur="4.89">on mornings on the mall Joe good morning</text>
  <text start="8.67" dur="4.71">good morning so much to talk to you</text>
  <text start="11.55" dur="3.749">about so let&amp;#39;s try to do this timeline</text>
  <text start="13.38" dur="4.2">order let&amp;#39;s start out with the hearings</text>
  <text start="15.299" dur="5.701">the impeachment hearings we now have</text>
  <text start="17.58" dur="5.55">Adam Schiff on with Jake Tapper this</text>
  <text start="21" dur="3.51">weekend saying well we may need to have</text>
  <text start="23.13" dur="3.659">some more hearings there&amp;#39;s more people</text>
  <text start="24.51" dur="5.16">we may need to talk to they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="26.789" dur="5.191">the votes do they I don&amp;#39;t know whether</text>
  <text start="29.67" dur="5.389">they do or not but I do know this that</text>
  <text start="31.98" dur="5.73">the impeachment hearings have been a</text>
  <text start="35.059" dur="5.68">disaster for the Democrats for this</text>
  <text start="37.71" dur="7.49">reason the fate of these hearings is</text>
  <text start="40.739" dur="8.64">Adam Schiff and it is an ugly face</text>
  <text start="45.2" dur="6.879">besides him you have these bureaucrats</text>
  <text start="49.379" dur="5.691">from the Department of State and the</text>
  <text start="52.079" dur="5.851">Department of Defense displaying</text>
  <text start="55.07" dur="5.89">incredible arrogance and condescension</text>
  <text start="57.93" dur="4.71">and disregard for the Constitution of</text>
  <text start="60.96" dur="4.85">the United States and those hearings I</text>
  <text start="62.64" dur="6.6">do not think that all of it looked good</text>
  <text start="65.81" dur="5.559">sounded good and felt good to the</text>
  <text start="69.24" dur="4.739">American people and indeed the polling</text>
  <text start="71.369" dur="5.521">data reveals that the Americans are</text>
  <text start="73.979" dur="5.221">turning on ship turning on Democrats and</text>
  <text start="76.89" dur="3.69">turning on impeachment I mean you really</text>
  <text start="79.2" dur="2.55">touched on it one of the lessons from</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="2.76">last week whatever you think of the</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="3.72">president and the way all of this played</text>
  <text start="83.34" dur="4.29">out it really is amazing to see</text>
  <text start="85.47" dur="4.259">diplomats so so-called career civil</text>
  <text start="87.63" dur="4.26">servants get to Congress and then voice</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="4.231">their disgust that they were aghast that</text>
  <text start="91.89" dur="4.08">the president didn&amp;#39;t use their talking</text>
  <text start="93.96" dur="4.74">points and didn&amp;#39;t abide by their</text>
  <text start="95.97" dur="4.859">recommendations well I think what you</text>
  <text start="98.7" dur="4.169">have here is an example of the</text>
  <text start="100.829" dur="5.271">brilliance of the Constitution under</text>
  <text start="102.869" dur="6.96">Article two it says categorically the</text>
  <text start="106.1" dur="5.83">executive power shall be vested in a</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="3.811">president of the United States of</text>
  <text start="111.93" dur="4.38">America period</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="5.519">there&amp;#39;s nothing about agencies there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.31" dur="5.339">nothing about cabinet members or</text>
  <text start="119.159" dur="6.21">independent regulatory agencies or</text>
  <text start="121.649" dur="7.051">generals or lieutenant Colonel&amp;#39;s you saw</text>
  <text start="125.369" dur="5.61">a stunning display of witnesses who had</text>
  <text start="128.7" dur="4.33">been prepared purposely by the Democrats</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="4.151">and shift to</text>
  <text start="133.03" dur="5.21">makes themselves look like they were</text>
  <text start="135.13" dur="5.85">smarter than more important thing and</text>
  <text start="138.24" dur="4.84">legally more significant than the</text>
  <text start="140.98" dur="4.26">President of the United States all of</text>
  <text start="143.08" dur="4.59">which was designed to turn the</text>
  <text start="145.24" dur="5.1">Constitution on its head every one of</text>
  <text start="147.67" dur="5.94">those witnesses was an arrogant</text>
  <text start="150.34" dur="5.36">condescending constitutional</text>
  <text start="153.61" dur="4.89">abolitionist</text>
  <text start="155.7" dur="4.69">if this where do you see the momentum of</text>
  <text start="158.5" dur="3.39">all of us headed do you think that the</text>
  <text start="160.39" dur="4.2">Democrats are going to vote for</text>
  <text start="161.89" dur="4.02">impeachment oh absolutely I don&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="164.59" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t have any choice by the way they</text>
  <text start="165.91" dur="6.27">set this up they promised their nut base</text>
  <text start="168.88" dur="6.27">that they&amp;#39;re going to do this if they</text>
  <text start="172.18" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t do this I don&amp;#39;t know what they do</text>
  <text start="175.15" dur="2.73">know I know they&amp;#39;re going to take a vote</text>
  <text start="177.04" dur="4.86">on impeachment</text>
  <text start="177.88" dur="7.14">now I do they have the votes after that</text>
  <text start="181.9" dur="5.16">display by Schiff and the idiots on that</text>
  <text start="185.02" dur="5.04">committee the Democratic idiots on that</text>
  <text start="187.06" dur="5.7">committee there are a substantial number</text>
  <text start="190.06" dur="6.06">of moderate Democrats in Trump districts</text>
  <text start="192.76" dur="5.82">who may decide that this is not worth</text>
  <text start="196.12" dur="3.96">party discipline I don&amp;#39;t know that they</text>
  <text start="198.58" dur="4.32">have the votes but they&amp;#39;re certainly</text>
  <text start="200.08" dur="4.5">going to try and you know I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="202.9" dur="3.99">believe she&amp;#39;s ever going to take the</text>
  <text start="204.58" dur="5.01">boat vote Pelosi without having the</text>
  <text start="206.89" dur="4.44">numbers and so if it goes to the Senate</text>
  <text start="209.59" dur="3.27">though if this if they take the votes if</text>
  <text start="211.33" dur="3.51">they have the numbers if it goes to the</text>
  <text start="212.86" dur="4.08">Senate does the Senate do the</text>
  <text start="214.84" dur="5.46">Republicans drag this out and call</text>
  <text start="216.94" dur="5.46">hunter Biden and call out vander chalupa</text>
  <text start="220.3" dur="3.81">and call either the whistle blower do</text>
  <text start="222.4" dur="5.49">they do that or do they get this over</text>
  <text start="224.11" dur="7.68">with quickly well that&amp;#39;s about it that</text>
  <text start="227.89" dur="7.05">to me is the $64 question you could drag</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="5.19">this out for two three four weeks to an</text>
  <text start="234.94" dur="3.299">acquittal which is going exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.98" dur="2.61">going to happen there&amp;#39;s going to be no</text>
  <text start="238.239" dur="4.711">conviction at the president the</text>
  <text start="239.59" dur="5.31">Democrats know that more than 20</text>
  <text start="242.95" dur="4.05">Republican senators are not going to</text>
  <text start="244.9" dur="4.32">switch to remove him from office because</text>
  <text start="247" dur="4.35">if they did it would be the end of the</text>
  <text start="249.22" dur="5.64">Republican Party and the end of those</text>
  <text start="251.35" dur="5.4">Republican senators so if this is not</text>
  <text start="254.86" dur="4.619">even a close call the question is will</text>
  <text start="256.75" dur="5.28">they want to do what the president is</text>
  <text start="259.479" dur="5.31">asking for which is call witnesses who</text>
  <text start="262.03" dur="4.83">will be extremely embarrassing to the</text>
  <text start="264.789" dur="4.801">Democratic Party and make no mistake of</text>
  <text start="266.86" dur="5.429">on it Vice President Biden is engaged in</text>
  <text start="269.59" dur="5.849">bribery and extortion in Ukraine the</text>
  <text start="272.289" dur="5.641">Biden case is a serious case involving</text>
  <text start="275.439" dur="4.921">gross misconduct by the vice president</text>
  <text start="277.93" dur="5.669">of the United States indeed what Biden</text>
  <text start="280.36" dur="5.73">did is impeachable he used his power as</text>
  <text start="283.599" dur="4.62">the vice president to extort a result in</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="5.49">a foreign country on behalf of his son</text>
  <text start="288.219" dur="7.531">who had violated Ukrainian not not</text>
  <text start="291.58" dur="6.6">necessarily Ukrainian law but US law now</text>
  <text start="295.75" dur="4.409">Joe I mean this side this all sounds</text>
  <text start="298.18" dur="4.049">good the idea of subpoenaing all these</text>
  <text start="300.159" dur="3.54">witnesses people related to the Biden&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.229" dur="3.631">and getting them to answer questions</text>
  <text start="303.699" dur="3.481">even Adam Schiff but something we have</text>
  <text start="305.86" dur="3.269">to remember about the Senate is there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.18" dur="4.139">a quite a few squishy Republican</text>
  <text start="309.129" dur="3.871">senators Mitt Romney comes to mind who</text>
  <text start="311.319" dur="3.69">aren&amp;#39;t gonna want to engage on this at</text>
  <text start="313" dur="4.289">all and don&amp;#39;t actually want the</text>
  <text start="315.009" dur="5.071">president&amp;#39;s witness list to be called</text>
  <text start="317.289" dur="4.891">that seems like a big problem well I</text>
  <text start="320.08" dur="3.899">think it&amp;#39;s and actually I think Vince</text>
  <text start="322.18" dur="4.41">you&amp;#39;d really hit on it no matter what</text>
  <text start="323.979" dur="4.74">some of us feel and would like to see</text>
  <text start="326.59" dur="5.669">happen which is the subpoena of these</text>
  <text start="328.719" dur="6.961">witnesses the Republican Senate is quite</text>
  <text start="332.259" dur="6.511">weak I am amazed that they have stayed</text>
  <text start="335.68" dur="4.739">together this far so long and I think</text>
  <text start="338.77" dur="2.85">that this is where they will end it</text>
  <text start="340.419" dur="3.541">they&amp;#39;re going to try and make it as</text>
  <text start="341.62" dur="3.99">short as possible they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="343.96" dur="3.87">want to subpoena the witnesses that the</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="3.72">president once they&amp;#39;re going to get to a</text>
  <text start="347.83" dur="3.53">very fast acquittal</text>
  <text start="349.33" dur="4.17">they might even do a motion to dismiss</text>
  <text start="351.36" dur="4.619">saying that there&amp;#39;s insufficient</text>
  <text start="353.5" dur="5.069">evidence that the House proceeding was</text>
  <text start="355.979" dur="5.56">unconstitutional it did not produce a</text>
  <text start="358.569" dur="4.44">result worthy of a Senate trial there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="361.539" dur="3.63">nothing in the case you have to have the</text>
  <text start="363.009" dur="3.63">trial but you said you have you receive</text>
  <text start="365.169" dur="3.391">it and then what do you do with it</text>
  <text start="366.639" dur="4.14">they could do nothing although I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="368.56" dur="3.75">see McConnell doing that now I&amp;#39;m glad</text>
  <text start="370.779" dur="4.23">you brought a motion to dismiss I wanted</text>
  <text start="372.31" dur="4.71">to ask you about that as well because is</text>
  <text start="375.009" dur="3.66">there a way here that Republicans in the</text>
  <text start="377.02" dur="3.84">Senate can accuse Adam Schiff of</text>
  <text start="378.669" dur="4.141">prosecutorial misconduct and say this</text>
  <text start="380.86" dur="3.929">was just a disaster all the way through</text>
  <text start="382.81" dur="3.779">he was a partisan in this he was</text>
  <text start="384.789" dur="3.87">involved in getting the whistleblower</text>
  <text start="386.589" dur="5.281">report filed in the first place this is</text>
  <text start="388.659" dur="4.98">not a real case let&amp;#39;s throw it out well</text>
  <text start="391.87" dur="3.089">they could do that but here&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="393.639" dur="3">Democrats are going to use they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="394.959" dur="3.811">to take the record that was compiled by</text>
  <text start="396.639" dur="4.231">the House Intelligence Committee they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.77" dur="4.56">going to send it to the House Judiciary</text>
  <text start="400.87" dur="4.44">the House Judiciary Committee is going</text>
  <text start="403.33" dur="4.05">to accept the findings of the House</text>
  <text start="405.31" dur="4.62">Intelligence Committee they will adopt</text>
  <text start="407.38" dur="4.95">them as their own they may even hold</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="6.48">some hearings and then send it to the</text>
  <text start="412.33" dur="5.61">Senate so my guess is that that argument</text>
  <text start="416.41" dur="3.24">may be made but I think what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="417.94" dur="3.39">more likely to do is say that the</text>
  <text start="419.65" dur="4.829">evidence is insufficient and throw it</text>
  <text start="421.33" dur="4.47">out but you know who knows there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="424.479" dur="4.581">going on here there are a lot of moving</text>
  <text start="425.8" dur="7.56">parts and when you have people like</text>
  <text start="429.06" dur="6.76">Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Romney</text>
  <text start="433.36" dur="4.2">and when you need unanimous consent to</text>
  <text start="435.82" dur="3.42">do certain things</text>
  <text start="437.56" dur="3.18">I think McConnell is threading the</text>
  <text start="439.24" dur="3.63">needle and so far McConnell&amp;#39;s done a</text>
  <text start="440.74" dur="4.17">brilliant job of doing that what are we</text>
  <text start="442.87" dur="5.76">to make then of Mitt Romney having lunch</text>
  <text start="444.91" dur="8.46">at the White House last week well you</text>
  <text start="448.63" dur="8.58">know Mitt Romney is a man in search of a</text>
  <text start="453.37" dur="7.68">mission as you as you know he is viewed</text>
  <text start="457.21" dur="6.269">in Utah in a very unflattering light</text>
  <text start="461.05" dur="4.26">these days and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.479" dur="4.261">understandable because of the things</text>
  <text start="465.31" dur="3.54">that he said the remarks that he&amp;#39;s made</text>
  <text start="467.74" dur="3.929">about the president</text>
  <text start="468.85" dur="5.39">he&amp;#39;s been very unused ha like in the</text>
  <text start="471.669" dur="5.071">manner of his speak very ungentlemanly</text>
  <text start="474.24" dur="3.85">but those myths in Romney&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="476.74" dur="3.149">reason he went to the White House to be</text>
  <text start="478.09" dur="5.759">interviewed to be Secretary of State he</text>
  <text start="479.889" dur="8.46">wants to be a big Macher and the truth</text>
  <text start="483.849" dur="6.271">is he&amp;#39;s very disliked among many people</text>
  <text start="488.349" dur="5.04">in the Senate and I think he has a</text>
  <text start="490.12" dur="6.03">constituency of one himself as Parnas</text>
  <text start="493.389" dur="5.581">the allegation is that Nunez met with</text>
  <text start="496.15" dur="5.43">the former a former Ukrainian prosecutor</text>
  <text start="498.97" dur="6.06">last year to discuss the Biden&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="501.58" dur="5.82">this all comes from TLAs live apart as</text>
  <text start="505.03" dur="5.759">this allegation his attorney Joseph</text>

  <text start="829.57" dur="4.889">mainstream media saying that you had</text>
  <text start="831.85" dur="7.2">meetings in Ukraine with the prosecutor</text>
  <text start="834.459" dur="6.031">what do you say about this well I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="839.05" dur="4.2">been used to this for the last three</text>
  <text start="840.49" dur="5.75">years the House Intelligence Committee</text>
  <text start="843.25" dur="5.339">Republicans we continue to expose</text>
  <text start="846.24" dur="6.55">Democrat corruption over and over again</text>
  <text start="848.589" dur="6.541">and what always happens is right when we</text>
  <text start="852.79" dur="4.739">expose them what do they do they go out</text>
  <text start="855.13" dur="6.209">to kill the messenger so this week</text>
  <text start="857.529" dur="6.151">another fake news story the problem with</text>
  <text start="861.339" dur="5.93">this week&amp;#39;s fake news story is we</text>
  <text start="863.68" dur="7.11">actually caught them and we caught them</text>
  <text start="867.269" dur="6.481">badly and it also involves criminal</text>
  <text start="870.79" dur="6.39">activity and so what we&amp;#39;re going to do I</text>
  <text start="873.75" dur="6.91">have a statement out on Friday night we</text>
  <text start="877.18" dur="6.959">are going to take full CNN and The Daily</text>
  <text start="880.66" dur="6.21">Beast likely into federal court right</text>
  <text start="884.139" dur="4.38">after Thanksgiving and we hope they</text>
  <text start="886.87" dur="3.959">cooperate because we&amp;#39;re also going to be</text>
  <text start="888.519" dur="4.861">working with the appropriate law</text>
  <text start="890.829" dur="3.481">enforcement authorities because it is</text>
  <text start="893.38" dur="3.209">not okay</text>
  <text start="894.31" dur="5.94">to work with someone who has been</text>
  <text start="896.589" dur="6.631">indicted on serious federal crime to</text>
  <text start="900.25" dur="6.089">build a media narrative and dirty up a</text>
  <text start="903.22" dur="5.25">member of Congress so look Maria it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="906.339" dur="5.041">you&amp;#39;ve seen it American people seen it</text>
  <text start="908.47" dur="4.65">over over the last three years we out</text>
  <text start="911.38" dur="4.11">them and then they come out out with a</text>
  <text start="913.12" dur="4.35">media narrative to try to dirty up the</text>
  <text start="915.49" dur="4.67">people who are doing the work on behalf</text>
  <text start="917.47" dur="6.03">of the American people so we hope that</text>
  <text start="920.16" dur="7.539">CNN and Daily Beast will cooperate with</text>
  <text start="923.5" dur="6.36">the court so you know they should comply</text>
  <text start="927.699" dur="6.271">with the subpoenas once we file this and</text>
  <text start="929.86" dur="6.33">and go through and sit for deposition so</text>
  <text start="933.97" dur="5.34">on congressman this this is just</text>
  <text start="936.19" dur="6.57">which comes from Lev Parnas who of</text>
  <text start="939.31" dur="5.67">course as you know is an associate</text>
  <text start="942.76" dur="4.32">former associate of Rudy and Giuliani</text>
  <text start="944.98" dur="4.65">who says that you met with the</text>
  <text start="947.08" dur="6.81">prosecutor Shokan in vieta bottom line</text>
  <text start="949.63" dur="7.08">were you in Vienna with shokan yeah so</text>
  <text start="953.89" dur="5.43">look Maria I really want to answer all</text>
  <text start="956.71" dur="4.14">of these questions and I promise you</text>
  <text start="959.32" dur="4.23">absolutely we&amp;#39;ll come back on the show</text>
  <text start="960.85" dur="5.25">and answer these questions but because</text>
  <text start="963.55" dur="4.11">there is criminal activity here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="966.1" dur="3.78">working with the appropriate law</text>
  <text start="967.66" dur="4.62">enforcement agencies we&amp;#39;re gonna file</text>
  <text start="969.88" dur="4.11">all this everyone&amp;#39;s gonna know the truth</text>
  <text start="972.28" dur="4.53">everybody&amp;#39;s going to know all the facts</text>
  <text start="973.99" dur="6.39">but I think you can understand that I</text>
  <text start="976.81" dur="5.76">can&amp;#39;t compete by trying to trying to</text>
  <text start="980.38" dur="4.74">debate this out with the public media</text>
  <text start="982.57" dur="5.7">when 90% of the media are totally</text>
  <text start="985.12" dur="6.03">corrupt and because this is criminal in</text>
  <text start="988.27" dur="5.97">nature and because it&amp;#39;s so bad it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="991.15" dur="5.61">those slanderous we&amp;#39;ve got all the facts</text>
  <text start="994.24" dur="5.1">on our side and we&amp;#39;re gonna file in</text>
  <text start="996.76" dur="4.56">federal court because I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="999.34" dur="3.72">sit here and try to compete against the</text>
  <text start="1001.32" dur="5.4">media that I have no chance of winning</text>
  <text start="1003.06" dur="6.15">with I will win in court and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1006.72" dur="5.19">have a chance to cooperate and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1009.21" dur="5.07">have to do to show how they work with</text>
  <text start="1011.91" dur="5.37">somebody who&amp;#39;s been indicted which is</text>
  <text start="1014.28" dur="5.73">you know likely conspiring to obstruct</text>
  <text start="1017.28" dur="4.38">justice so so I want to just be clear</text>
  <text start="1020.01" dur="3.24">before I move on I gotta get your take</text>
  <text start="1021.66" dur="3.75">on the impeachment hearings but but just</text>
  <text start="1023.25" dur="4.53">to be clear you&amp;#39;re saying you&amp;#39;re suing</text>
  <text start="1025.41" dur="4.23">CNN you&amp;#39;re gonna sue Daily Beast you you</text>
  <text start="1027.78" dur="3.299">I know you you&amp;#39;ve sued Twitter in the</text>
  <text start="1029.64" dur="3.689">past do you think this is going</text>
  <text start="1031.079" dur="6">somewhere you&amp;#39;re telling me that CNN</text>
  <text start="1033.329" dur="6.99">committed criminal activity well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1037.079" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s very likely or their or their an</text>
  <text start="1040.319" dur="4.441">accessory to it right so so none of this</text>
  <text start="1043.079" dur="3.36">is true that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve said my</text>
  <text start="1044.76" dur="3.179">statement is it&amp;#39;s demonstrable e false</text>
  <text start="1046.439" dur="4.291">we&amp;#39;ll get to all the facts when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1047.939" dur="4.621">filed in court so you know but somehow</text>
