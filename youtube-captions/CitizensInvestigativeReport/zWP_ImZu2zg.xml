  <text start="49.86" dur="5.699">achievements of our time which is your</text>
  <text start="52.5" dur="6.899">letter dated September 15th to your</text>
  <text start="55.559" dur="6.18">colleague Adam Schiff the chairman of</text>
  <text start="59.399" dur="5.58">the House Intelligence Committee in</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="7.891">which you discuss many of the errors</text>
  <text start="64.979" dur="8.57">that Schiff made in his discussion of</text>
  <text start="69.63" dur="6.629">the page FISA warrant and dossier all</text>
  <text start="73.549" dur="4.93">issues that were covered in the Horowitz</text>
  <text start="76.259" dur="5.341">report and all which are now have now</text>
  <text start="78.479" dur="7.5">been proved to be false in the Horowitz</text>
  <text start="81.6" dur="6.559">report and you suggest that that your</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="6.21">colleague representative shift needs</text>

  <text start="92.189" dur="5.341">rehabilitation and you write quote as</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="6.72">part of your rehabilitation it&amp;#39;s crucial</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="4.409">that you admit you have a problem you</text>
  <text start="100.71" dur="2.61">were hijacking the Intelligence</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="3.451">Committee for political purposes while</text>
  <text start="103.32" dur="5.82">excusing and covering up intelligence</text>
  <text start="105.39" dur="5.67">agency abuses I understand taking action</text>
  <text start="109.14" dur="4.29">on this issue will be difficult for you</text>
  <text start="111.06" dur="4.919">as it will be an implicit acknowledgment</text>
  <text start="113.43" dur="4.2">that you were wrong to deny these abuses</text>
  <text start="115.979" dur="3.451">and that you were complicit in the</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="5.79">violation of America&amp;#39;s civil liberties</text>
  <text start="119.43" dur="7.289">nevertheless I refuse to believe you are</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="5.6">beyond redemption I invite you to work</text>
  <text start="126.719" dur="5.16">closely with me on your rehabilitation</text>
  <text start="129.02" dur="4.36">program you are trolling the hell out of</text>
  <text start="131.879" dur="4.121">this guy</text>
  <text start="133.38" dur="4.27">well it&amp;#39;s a Christmas season and I</text>
  <text start="136" dur="4.17">thought everybody at one point or</text>
  <text start="137.65" dur="4.26">another makes mistakes and obviously he</text>
  <text start="140.17" dur="3.69">made several mistakes but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.91" dur="4.35">Christmastime new year I thought I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="143.86" dur="4.38">reach out and give him a chance for</text>
  <text start="146.26" dur="4.86">redemption we should all have you know</text>
  <text start="148.24" dur="4.71">forgiveness in our hearts and so it was</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="3.69">from the heart that I sent that letter</text>
  <text start="152.95" dur="3">you you did a good job reading it you</text>
  <text start="154.81" dur="3.66">should get into the business of these</text>
  <text start="155.95" dur="3.9">and read the whole thing though no it</text>
  <text start="158.47" dur="3.36">was it would take quite a while to read</text>
  <text start="159.85" dur="5.1">the whole thing now have you received</text>
  <text start="161.83" dur="4.34">any response from the chairman or anyone</text>
  <text start="164.95" dur="4.8">on his behalf</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="7.09">no the only response that I was that</text>
  <text start="169.75" dur="6.62">I&amp;#39;ve caught is that he&amp;#39;s been this was</text>
  <text start="173.26" dur="6.89">from one of the sunday shows where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="6.7">his excuse is that this was somehow new</text>
  <text start="180.15" dur="4.809">information that he had seen and so</text>
  <text start="183.07" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re going to take it seriously but</text>
  <text start="184.959" dur="5.401">in fact that&amp;#39;s just another lie because</text>
  <text start="188.32" dur="4.83">yeah well we couldn&amp;#39;t have wrote our</text>
  <text start="190.36" dur="5.55">memo if we didn&amp;#39;t have that actual</text>
  <text start="193.15" dur="4.92">information so for him to say that he</text>
  <text start="195.91" dur="5.51">didn&amp;#39;t have it it was only because</text>
  <text start="198.07" dur="6.84">either at the time they couldn&amp;#39;t read or</text>
  <text start="201.42" dur="5.289">they refused to read or they&amp;#39;re lying</text>
  <text start="204.91" dur="3.18">because the fact is they had all that</text>
  <text start="206.709" dur="3.271">information they knew about the</text>
  <text start="208.09" dur="3.33">information and they lied to the</text>
  <text start="209.98" dur="4.11">American public about that information</text>
  <text start="211.42" dur="3.9">we are talking about and the only reason</text>
  <text start="214.09" dur="3.149">we&amp;#39;re talking about all of this of</text>
  <text start="215.32" dur="4.53">course is because the Horowitz report</text>
  <text start="217.239" dur="5.371">has come out and we have an official an</text>
  <text start="219.85" dur="4.74">official view on all of this but you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="222.61" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re talking about a memo that you</text>
  <text start="224.59" dur="7.01">released a short memo it was only I</text>
  <text start="227.17" dur="9.99">think four pages and in February of 2018</text>
  <text start="231.6" dur="8.44">and it really had three points and one</text>
  <text start="237.16" dur="5.04">point was the dossier was bunk and the</text>
  <text start="240.04" dur="3.9">second point was the dossier was paid</text>
  <text start="242.2" dur="3.96">for by the Clinton campaign and the</text>
  <text start="243.94" dur="3.9">Democratic National Committee and the</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="4.16">third point was at the FBI and Justice</text>
  <text start="247.84" dur="7.44">Department used the dossier extensively</text>
  <text start="250.32" dur="10.18">to to get a wiretap warrant on Carter</text>
  <text start="255.28" dur="7.02">page these are all facts and they really</text>
  <text start="260.5" dur="4.229">should have been fairly visible or</text>
  <text start="262.3" dur="3.33">apparent to two people at the time if</text>
  <text start="264.729" dur="2.84">they were covering it closely</text>
  <text start="265.63" dur="5.8">nevertheless</text>
  <text start="267.569" dur="7.35">once this is released your your memo</text>
  <text start="271.43" dur="6.88">ship and the Democrats release a counter</text>
  <text start="274.919" dur="5.851">memo in which they basically deny</text>
  <text start="278.31" dur="3.87">everything you had said and now we</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="3.6">actually have in the form of the</text>
  <text start="282.18" dur="6.57">Horowitz report a judgment on who was</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="6.72">correct and it was you so first of all</text>
  <text start="288.75" dur="4.44">yeah I remember it quite well you had to</text>
  <text start="291.09" dur="4.829">jump through a lot of Hoops even to get</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="4.319">that information out didn&amp;#39;t you yeah</text>
  <text start="295.919" dur="4.351">there&amp;#39;s a lot of thoughts I have on this</text>
  <text start="297.509" dur="6.75">and we can start with the fact that the</text>
  <text start="300.27" dur="7.82">then deputy director of the Attorney</text>
  <text start="304.259" dur="7.891">General Rosen Stein and FBI director Ray</text>
  <text start="308.09" dur="6.37">said some pretty hard nasty things about</text>
  <text start="312.15" dur="3.93">me that it was reckless that we</text>
  <text start="314.46" dur="3.72">shouldn&amp;#39;t be putting this out I think</text>
  <text start="316.08" dur="3.63">that has to be revisited those those</text>
  <text start="318.18" dur="4.5">issues have to be revisited and those</text>
  <text start="319.71" dur="4.709">individuals need to speak there were a</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="3.63">lot of official statements to the effect</text>
  <text start="324.419" dur="3.511">that if you release this information</text>
  <text start="326.31" dur="3.53">people might die it would endanger</text>
  <text start="327.93" dur="4.28">national security and it would endanger</text>
  <text start="329.84" dur="5.02">people who are serving the United States</text>
  <text start="332.21" dur="4.84">that&amp;#39;s right but those two in particular</text>
  <text start="334.86" dur="5.52">concern me quite a bit because once</text>
  <text start="337.05" dur="5.669">again either they didn&amp;#39;t go review the</text>
  <text start="340.38" dur="5.37">FISA like we had been reviewing the FISA</text>
  <text start="342.719" dur="5.25">and well you know or they couldn&amp;#39;t read</text>
  <text start="345.75" dur="3.509">or there was a reason that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="347.969" dur="4.26">do it but but you know they need to</text>
  <text start="349.259" dur="4.291">answer to that I think I mean at least I</text>
  <text start="352.229" dur="3">Roseanne Stein doesn&amp;#39;t because he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="353.55" dur="4.23">of government Ray is still in government</text>
  <text start="355.229" dur="3.84">he needs to answer as to why he would</text>
  <text start="357.78" dur="4.139">have sent that letter which was</text>
  <text start="359.069" dur="5.301">obviously very you know harmful to me as</text>
  <text start="361.919" dur="5.31">someone who has to go before the voters</text>
  <text start="364.37" dur="3.97">next in line let&amp;#39;s just forget all the</text>
  <text start="367.229" dur="3.03">Democrat and all the Democratic</text>
  <text start="368.34" dur="4.229">politicians because we&amp;#39;ll just put them</text>
  <text start="370.259" dur="5.19">to the side I think my letter to shift</text>
  <text start="372.569" dur="5.671">speaks for itself but I would say the</text>
  <text start="375.449" dur="5.22">the next biggest culprits are you know</text>
  <text start="378.24" dur="5.13">ninety percent of the media who</text>
  <text start="380.669" dur="5.3">regurgitated what Ray had said</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="5.4">regurgitated what the Democrats had said</text>
  <text start="385.969" dur="5.29">over and over and over at nauseam</text>
  <text start="388.77" dur="4.079">instead of being real reporters who</text>
  <text start="391.259" dur="3.241">should have asked the question well</text>
  <text start="392.849" dur="3.57">let&amp;#39;s see here we&amp;#39;ve got the chairman of</text>
  <text start="394.5" dur="3.21">the Intelligence Committee with the full</text>
  <text start="396.419" dur="2.86">support of the Speaker of the House Paul</text>
  <text start="397.71" dur="4.149">Ryan at the time</text>
  <text start="399.279" dur="4.68">saying that this happened we have the</text>
  <text start="401.859" dur="4.23">Democrats saying something completely</text>
  <text start="403.959" dur="4.98">opposite and the FBI director saying</text>
  <text start="406.089" dur="4.89">something opposite so who&amp;#39;s telling the</text>
  <text start="408.939" dur="4.38">truth the press should have been out you</text>
  <text start="410.979" dur="4.2">know not you know not calling you know</text>
  <text start="413.319" dur="3.87">just taking someone&amp;#39;s side and saying</text>
  <text start="415.179" dur="4.35">that I was lying I was misleading I was</text>
  <text start="417.189" dur="4.98">endangering national security you know</text>
  <text start="419.529" dur="4.83">that was all nonsense and it was you</text>
  <text start="422.169" dur="8.28">know I just want to reiterate this again</text>
  <text start="424.359" dur="8.16">how harmful that was to myself the</text>
  <text start="430.449" dur="4.35">entire Republican Conference which we</text>
  <text start="432.519" dur="5.88">ended up losing the house you know if</text>
  <text start="434.799" dur="5.16">Ray had not weighed in if the Democrats</text>
  <text start="438.399" dur="3.39">would have told the truth if the media</text>
  <text start="439.959" dur="4.71">would have told the truth thanks very</text>
  <text start="441.789" dur="4.8">possible that we would not have lost the</text>
  <text start="444.669" dur="4.59">House of Representatives so you know</text>
  <text start="446.589" dur="4.59">major consequences here because they</text>
  <text start="449.259" dur="3.24">poison the minds of millions of</text>
  <text start="451.179" dur="3.51">Americans and this was part of their</text>
  <text start="452.499" dur="4.32">plan in order to do two things</text>
  <text start="454.689" dur="3.69">cats doubt that the Republicans were</text>
  <text start="456.819" dur="5.13">running some coverup and that we were</text>
  <text start="458.379" dur="5.61">secretly tied to vitomir Putin and in</text>
  <text start="461.949" dur="4.77">addition to that it was a major</text>
  <text start="463.989" dur="4.53">fundraising scheme I mean they raised</text>
  <text start="466.719" dur="3.99">millions and millions and millions of</text>
  <text start="468.519" dur="4.65">dollars you know saying you know hold</text>
  <text start="470.709" dur="4.44">the Republicans and their you know the</text>
  <text start="473.169" dur="4.2">the Putin puppets hold them accountable</text>
  <text start="475.149" dur="4.711">send us money now we&amp;#39;re gonna knock out</text>
  <text start="477.369" dur="3.9">you know Republicans so and so you know</text>
  <text start="479.86" dur="3.779">and sure enough you know they knocked</text>
  <text start="481.269" dur="5.64">out a lot of our incumbent so you know</text>
  <text start="483.639" dur="5.971">this was this was the politicization of</text>
  <text start="486.909" dur="5.67">intelligence you know that started in</text>
  <text start="489.61" dur="6.509">2016 too dirty at the Trump campaign but</text>
  <text start="492.579" dur="5.52">it culminated in 2018 with really the</text>
  <text start="496.119" dur="5.58">smearing of the Republican Party led by</text>
  <text start="498.099" dur="6.21">the top intelligence officials now and</text>
  <text start="501.699" dur="7.62">former intelligence officials what they</text>
  <text start="504.309" dur="8.34">did was they they denied many of the</text>
  <text start="509.319" dur="5.88">statements in your memo for example</text>
  <text start="512.649" dur="5.61">here&amp;#39;s the fourth paragraph in your memo</text>
  <text start="515.199" dur="4.56">which says the dossier compiled by</text>
  <text start="518.259" dur="3.75">Christopher Steele on behalf of the</text>
  <text start="519.759" dur="4.651">Democratic Democratic National Committee</text>
  <text start="522.009" dur="4.56">and the Hillary Clinton campaign formed</text>
  <text start="524.41" dur="6.119">an essential part of the Carter page</text>
  <text start="526.569" dur="6.721">FISA application now they said this was</text>
  <text start="530.529" dur="7.321">absolutely false that it did not</text>
  <text start="533.29" dur="9.09">form an essential part and now we have</text>
  <text start="537.85" dur="9.24">the Horowitz report which says that the</text>
  <text start="542.38" dur="8.76">dossier formed a central and essential</text>
  <text start="547.09" dur="5.91">part of the FAFSA application so when</text>
  <text start="551.14" dur="3.66">you get this when you see when you</text>
  <text start="553" dur="5.07">finally see the Horowitz report and you</text>
  <text start="554.8" dur="5.37">didn&amp;#39;t have a an advance look at it any</text>
  <text start="558.07" dur="4.98">more than anybody else did you that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.17" dur="4.26">correct okay so you see it you see it</text>
  <text start="563.05" dur="3.72">when the rest of the world sees it and</text>
  <text start="564.43" dur="5.82">here it says the dossier is an essential</text>
  <text start="566.77" dur="6.42">part of the fisa application and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="570.25" dur="4.89">it precisely in the same word what you</text>
  <text start="573.19" dur="5.22">had said in February of last year and</text>
  <text start="575.14" dur="7.92">you know you get really hammered for it</text>
  <text start="578.41" dur="6.81">so what do you think well I would say I</text>
  <text start="583.06" dur="3.69">would say that it wasn&amp;#39;t it was obvious</text>
  <text start="585.22" dur="3.27">that&amp;#39;s what had happened when you when</text>
  <text start="586.75" dur="3.69">you read it and then you know the fact</text>
  <text start="588.49" dur="4.86">that they had they had spun the dossier</text>
  <text start="590.44" dur="5.79">to news outlets which they now we now we</text>
  <text start="593.35" dur="4.74">know they actually knew that steel was</text>
  <text start="596.23" dur="4.98">talking to the media so they knew it was</text>
  <text start="598.09" dur="5.37">a fake news story built off of a fake</text>
  <text start="601.21" dur="4.98">dossier that had already been it was</text>
  <text start="603.46" dur="6.06">also being used in in the FISA warrant</text>
  <text start="606.19" dur="4.89">but but remember there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="609.52" dur="4.26">couple things that are even worse than</text>
  <text start="611.08" dur="4.2">that from my from my point of view one</text>
  <text start="613.78" dur="3.36">of those issues is one that we found</text>
  <text start="615.28" dur="5.07">after the memo or we would have put it</text>
  <text start="617.14" dur="5.67">in because in the in the application and</text>
  <text start="620.35" dur="6.24">the FISA application there is a another</text>
  <text start="622.81" dur="6.81">part that talks about a source you know</text>
  <text start="626.59" dur="5.07">of additional information well that</text>
  <text start="629.62" dur="6.81">additional information we didn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="631.66" dur="7.68">out oh probably mid 2018 that that was</text>
  <text start="636.43" dur="6.15">where they had actually did pre spying</text>
  <text start="639.34" dur="6.3">to the FISA application spine and the</text>
  <text start="642.58" dur="5.61">the warrant spine they had done pre</text>
  <text start="645.64" dur="6.72">spying and that had that occurred in</text>
  <text start="648.19" dur="6.96">August in September of 2018 where they</text>
  <text start="652.36" dur="5.43">wore devices some of their people wore</text>
  <text start="655.15" dur="4.8">devices and secretly recorded trumped</text>
  <text start="657.79" dur="6.33">rim campaign officials okay August</text>
  <text start="659.95" dur="6.77">September 2016 right 2016 yes I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="664.12" dur="5.3">this isn&amp;#39;t this is an August</text>
  <text start="666.72" dur="4.86">and September of 2016 before the first</text>
  <text start="669.42" dur="3.66">warrant they were actually spying</text>
  <text start="671.58" dur="4.02">already recording</text>
  <text start="673.08" dur="5.16">Carter page and Papadopoulos and what we</text>
  <text start="675.6" dur="4.74">found at the time was they they put in a</text>
  <text start="678.24" dur="5.07">few things to pretend it was a source</text>
  <text start="680.34" dur="4.71">that was validating steel and that these</text>
  <text start="683.31" dur="4.43">guys were somehow sneaking around doing</text>
  <text start="685.05" dur="4.83">nefarious things and supported the</text>
  <text start="687.74" dur="4.24">supported the warrant they used it to</text>
  <text start="689.88" dur="4.41">support the warrant the problem with it</text>
  <text start="691.98" dur="5.19">was is that they left all the</text>
  <text start="694.29" dur="5.45">exculpatory evidence on the ground and</text>
  <text start="697.17" dur="5.55">it was very clear scope Ettore evidence</text>
  <text start="699.74" dur="5.44">against both page who the warrant was</text>
  <text start="702.72" dur="4.32">against and also Papadopoulos who they</text>
  <text start="705.18" dur="4.14">claimed you know the the australian who</text>
  <text start="707.04" dur="4.08">heard at a bar that they were you know</text>
  <text start="709.32" dur="3.63">they were drinking and then Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="711.12" dur="3.81">said something about emails or down or</text>
  <text start="712.95" dur="3.3">dirt and of course that made its way to</text>
  <text start="714.93" dur="3.72">the State Department and that was the</text>
  <text start="716.25" dur="3.84">FBI&amp;#39;s reason for starting the whole damn</text>
  <text start="718.65" dur="3.3">thing in the first place so they even</text>
  <text start="720.09" dur="4.04">had they should have questioned</text>
  <text start="721.95" dur="4.05">immediately whether or not the entire</text>
  <text start="724.13" dur="4.3">investigation should have been thrown</text>
  <text start="726" dur="4.32">out when that recording was made and</text>
  <text start="728.43" dur="4.14">then transferred over to the FBI because</text>
  <text start="730.32" dur="4.38">it was clearly the first contact of the</text>
  <text start="732.57" dur="3.78">first verbal information they had from</text>
  <text start="734.7" dur="3.54">an American citizen george papadapolis</text>
  <text start="736.35" dur="4.62">who they had used to start this whole</text>
  <text start="738.24" dur="5.12">thing and then secondly it was</text>
  <text start="740.97" dur="4.95">definitely information about carter page</text>
  <text start="743.36" dur="4.69">we know we also knew that carter page</text>
  <text start="745.92" dur="4.5">had cooperated with other government</text>
  <text start="748.05" dur="4.77">agencies including he had actually</text>
  <text start="750.42" dur="6.33">cooperated with the FBI previously in</text>
  <text start="752.82" dur="7.14">2014 and that was left out of the of the</text>
  <text start="756.75" dur="6.21">FISA application so that to me was</text>
  <text start="759.96" dur="5.94">actually equally as bad or even somewhat</text>
  <text start="762.96" dur="5.07">a little bit worse than using the</text>
  <text start="765.9" dur="4.95">clinton jinda political opposition</text>
  <text start="768.03" dur="5.07">research fake dossier and the fake news</text>
  <text start="770.85" dur="4.47">stories i think leaving exculpatory</text>
  <text start="773.1" dur="4.56">evidence is even worse than that however</text>
  <text start="775.32" dur="5.07">I give Horowitz a lot of credit because</text>
  <text start="777.66" dur="7.14">probably the worst thing of all of it is</text>
  <text start="780.39" dur="7.71">when you actually dr. emails and that</text>
  <text start="784.8" dur="5.67">that we did not have and that&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="788.1" dur="7.41">worse than everything else combined so</text>
  <text start="790.47" dur="7.44">in all this is a dark day for America</text>
  <text start="795.51" dur="3.629">it&amp;#39;s a dark day for our intelligence</text>
  <text start="797.91" dur="4.889">services</text>
  <text start="799.139" dur="6.36">and they in fact have made America much</text>
  <text start="802.799" dur="4.98">less safe because until there are major</text>
  <text start="805.499" dur="4.86">reforms there&amp;#39;s no way in hell</text>
  <text start="807.779" dur="4.71">Republicans are going to support you</text>
  <text start="810.359" dur="4.47">know FISA warrants against American</text>
  <text start="812.489" dur="4.83">citizens I just can&amp;#39;t see us doing that</text>
  <text start="814.829" dur="3.99">the question will be how do we reform it</text>
  <text start="817.319" dur="4.2">and when do we get those reforms because</text>
  <text start="818.819" dur="3.96">I think no one&amp;#39;s going to have any faith</text>
  <text start="821.519" dur="3.48">in at least in the House of</text>
  <text start="822.779" dur="5.16">Representatives I can say have faith in</text>
  <text start="824.999" dur="6.09">the current FBI to to make any changes</text>
  <text start="827.939" dur="6.27">now let me ask you about that pre spying</text>
  <text start="831.089" dur="5.49">you brought up which was the the</text>
  <text start="834.209" dur="7.891">crossfire hurricane investigation has</text>
  <text start="836.579" dur="8.31">begun on July 31 2016 and they</text>
  <text start="842.1" dur="5.039">investigate they target four people</text>
  <text start="844.889" dur="5.75">associated with the Trump campaign page</text>
  <text start="847.139" dur="6.06">Papadopoulos Manta Ford and Flynn and</text>
  <text start="850.639" dur="5.92">certainly the page in Papadopoulos and</text>
  <text start="853.199" dur="5.49">with an unnamed high-ranking Trump</text>
  <text start="856.559" dur="5.87">campaign official who is not named in</text>
  <text start="858.689" dur="6.27">the report they they the FBI send</text>
  <text start="862.429" dur="5.171">informants under false pretenses to meet</text>
  <text start="864.959" dur="5.011">with them and the meetings are all</text>
  <text start="867.6" dur="4.109">recorded they&amp;#39;re secretly recorded and</text>
  <text start="869.97" dur="4.049">by the way for you listeners if you read</text>
  <text start="871.709" dur="4.891">the report it&amp;#39;ll say that this</text>
  <text start="874.019" dur="5.04">conversation was quote consensually</text>
  <text start="876.6" dur="4.979">recorded they do not mean that Carter</text>
  <text start="879.059" dur="5.551">page or George papadopolis agreed to be</text>
  <text start="881.579" dur="7.17">recorded it&amp;#39;s the the informant who</text>
  <text start="884.61" dur="6.75">consented to be recorded it&amp;#39;s a secret</text>
  <text start="888.749" dur="5.55">to the person who&amp;#39;s actually being</text>
  <text start="891.36" dur="5.55">recorded here so the question is took me</text>
  <text start="894.299" dur="4.38">a long time just as an outside reporter</text>
  <text start="896.91" dur="4.769">to kind of figure out what was going on</text>
  <text start="898.679" dur="5.97">we had trey gowdy after he left the</text>
  <text start="901.679" dur="5.16">house making clear references to the</text>
  <text start="904.649" dur="3.99">possibility of transcripts of recorded</text>
  <text start="906.839" dur="4.321">conversations but it was still in</text>
  <text start="908.639" dur="6.211">somebody like my mind it was very fuzzy</text>
  <text start="911.16" dur="5.549">when did you know that that was</text>
  <text start="914.85" dur="3.899">happening that the FBI had targeted</text>
  <text start="916.709" dur="5.13">these figures in the campaign with</text>
  <text start="918.749" dur="5.27">informants and and in conversations were</text>
  <text start="921.839" dur="5.3">secretly recorded</text>
  <text start="924.019" dur="4.8">oh I forget the the dates but it was it</text>
  <text start="927.139" dur="3.81">was the middle of last year around the</text>
  <text start="928.819" dur="4.291">middle of 2018 so that was around the</text>
  <text start="930.949" dur="4.23">time that we were essentially really</text>
  <text start="933.11" dur="4.8">upset at Rosenstein and we were having</text>
  <text start="935.179" dur="5.16">these additional meetings this is where</text>
  <text start="937.91" dur="4.079">if you remember paul ryan and i and trey</text>
  <text start="940.339" dur="4.29">gowdy had to go over to the department</text>
  <text start="941.989" dur="4.47">of justice you know where we had to get</text>
  <text start="944.629" dur="3.481">a lecture about how we were damaging</text>
  <text start="946.459" dur="3.93">national security and that we needed to</text>
  <text start="948.11" dur="4.469">stop looking at this and we had to fight</text>
  <text start="950.389" dur="5.7">every step of the way they fought us I</text>
  <text start="952.579" dur="5.88">mean these guys either wittingly or</text>
  <text start="956.089" dur="4.53">unwittingly were obstructing justice</text>
  <text start="958.459" dur="4.021">they were obstructing a congressional</text>
  <text start="960.619" dur="4.2">investigation that now Horowitz is</text>
  <text start="962.48" dur="5.069">showin we were not only were we on</text>
  <text start="964.819" dur="5.341">target we actually underestimated the</text>
  <text start="967.549" dur="4.77">amount of corruption here so you know I</text>
  <text start="970.16" dur="3.659">don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s too late for Durham</text>
  <text start="972.319" dur="3.45">or anybody to go back and a lot of those</text>
  <text start="973.819" dur="4.11">probably weren&amp;#39;t recorded but you know</text>
  <text start="975.769" dur="4.62">they were trying to I mean it was if</text>
  <text start="977.929" dur="3.481">there&amp;#39;s not a better description of</text>
  <text start="980.389" dur="2.91">obstruction of a congressional</text>
  <text start="981.41" dur="4.32">investigation and what the Department of</text>
  <text start="983.299" dur="5.34">Justice and the FBI did to House</text>
  <text start="985.73" dur="4.74">Republicans in 2018 I mean it was</text>
  <text start="988.639" dur="3.331">meeting after meeting after meeting you</text>
  <text start="990.47" dur="4.049">may remember this Byron letter after</text>
  <text start="991.97" dur="6.809">letter subpoena you know the threatening</text>
  <text start="994.519" dur="5.581">to impeach Trump officials it went on</text>
  <text start="998.779" dur="3.24">and on and that&amp;#39;s when we started</text>
  <text start="1000.1" dur="5.459">demanding for the declassification of</text>
  <text start="1002.019" dur="5.19">all of these documents I mean it was you</text>
  <text start="1005.559" dur="4.77">know it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a dark chapter in</text>
  <text start="1007.209" dur="6.09">American history and I&amp;#39;m not you know</text>
  <text start="1010.329" dur="5.07">you know nobody should be proud to be to</text>
  <text start="1013.299" dur="4.14">be to be part of this at all it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1015.399" dur="3.87">embarrassment to our country it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1017.439" dur="3.75">embarrassment to all these officials I</text>
  <text start="1019.269" dur="4.35">mean you&amp;#39;ve seen you know Comey do these</text>
  <text start="1021.189" dur="4.23">these you know goofy interviews that</text>
  <text start="1023.619" dur="6.751">he&amp;#39;s done you know he wouldn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1025.419" dur="7.62">agree to his to get his clearance back</text>
  <text start="1030.37" dur="4.679">so he could answer the IDS questions and</text>
  <text start="1033.039" dur="5.13">I think it&amp;#39;s all the more reason why we</text>
  <text start="1035.049" dur="5.37">have John Durham the US Attorney out of</text>
  <text start="1038.169" dur="4.711">Connecticut who&amp;#39;s conducting you know a</text>
  <text start="1040.419" dur="4.321">real investigation because you started</text>
  <text start="1042.88" dur="3.72">off with talking about the spine that</text>
  <text start="1044.74" dur="6.63">was occurring the pre spying that was</text>
  <text start="1046.6" dur="6.059">occurring in the fall of 2016 but here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1051.37" dur="5.789">what doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="1052.659" dur="5.571">there was pre pre spying so before July</text>
  <text start="1057.159" dur="4">31st</text>
  <text start="1058.23" dur="7.409">the same spy ring that was operating in</text>
  <text start="1061.159" dur="8.14">2016 and the fall of 2016 was in full</text>
  <text start="1065.639" dur="6.811">motion by late spring early summer doing</text>
  <text start="1069.299" dur="5.96">the same type of spine so those</text>
  <text start="1072.45" dur="5.49">questions have not been answered</text>
  <text start="1075.259" dur="4.66">adequately Horowitz was unable to get to</text>
  <text start="1077.94" dur="3.209">the bottom of it that&amp;#39;s why you know</text>
  <text start="1079.919" dur="3.661">when Horowitz says well there was no</text>
  <text start="1081.149" dur="4.53">bias that he could see you know he was</text>
  <text start="1083.58" dur="3.74">not able to figure out what happened pre</text>
  <text start="1085.679" dur="4.11">July 31</text>
  <text start="1087.32" dur="5.17">we&amp;#39;re back with representative Devin</text>
  <text start="1089.789" dur="5.911">Nunez talking about the Horowitz report</text>
  <text start="1092.49" dur="7.889">and other related matters and one of the</text>
  <text start="1095.7" dur="6.449">things about this February 2018 Nunez</text>
  <text start="1100.379" dur="3.481">memo which is just absolutely critical</text>
  <text start="1102.149" dur="2.91">in this whole thing I don&amp;#39;t think there</text>
  <text start="1103.86" dur="2.97">would have been a Horowitz report</text>
  <text start="1105.059" dur="6.09">without it</text>
  <text start="1106.83" dur="7.079">you had to fight very hard to get some</text>
  <text start="1111.149" dur="5.461">of this information Declassified and it</text>
  <text start="1113.909" dur="4.86">was only I believe in the end if I</text>
  <text start="1116.61" dur="5.029">remember correctly a direct order from</text>
  <text start="1118.769" dur="6.211">President Trump that allowed it to be</text>
  <text start="1121.639" dur="5.38">declassified and one thing that struck</text>
  <text start="1124.98" dur="4.289">me at the time was at the time you were</text>
  <text start="1127.019" dur="4.26">the chairman of the House Intelligence</text>
  <text start="1129.269" dur="4.74">Committee and you mentioned in passing</text>
  <text start="1131.279" dur="4.951">before that you had the support of Paul</text>
  <text start="1134.009" dur="4.11">Ryan at the time and that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1136.23" dur="3.96">important because I think the an</text>
  <text start="1138.119" dur="3.93">administration may feel they can even</text>
  <text start="1140.19" dur="3.3">blow off a chairman of a committee but</text>
  <text start="1142.049" dur="4.32">if the chairman has the speaker of the</text>
  <text start="1143.49" dur="6.539">house behind him that that&amp;#39;s a pretty</text>
  <text start="1146.369" dur="5.28">big thing and yet it was still pulling</text>
  <text start="1150.029" dur="5.821">teeth and took a direct order from the</text>
  <text start="1151.649" dur="8.191">president to get this stuff out and I</text>
  <text start="1155.85" dur="6.39">think it should strike every American is</text>
  <text start="1159.84" dur="6.329">how extraordinarily difficult it is to</text>
  <text start="1162.24" dur="6.12">find out what these intelligence and law</text>
  <text start="1166.169" dur="3.87">enforcement agencies are doing and if</text>
  <text start="1168.36" dur="4.319">you remember Byron it was actually more</text>
  <text start="1170.039" dur="3.901">complicated than that the House and</text>
  <text start="1172.679" dur="4.62">Senate Intelligence Committee were</text>
  <text start="1173.94" dur="5.88">created after Watergate after the church</text>
  <text start="1177.299" dur="4.141">commission you know said that there</text>
  <text start="1179.82" dur="3.209">needed to be better oversight over the</text>
  <text start="1181.44" dur="3.829">intelligence agencies because after</text>
  <text start="1183.029" dur="6">Watergate they figured out that that</text>
  <text start="1185.269" dur="6.431">that Nixon LBJ and even John F Kennedy</text>
  <text start="1189.029" dur="5.4">were weaponizing the intelligence agent</text>
  <text start="1191.7" dur="5.729">he&amp;#39;s for political purposes in the rules</text>
  <text start="1194.429" dur="4.561">when when our committee was created they</text>
  <text start="1197.429" dur="3.291">were smart and they said well if</text>
  <text start="1198.99" dur="4.86">anything ever needs to be declassified</text>
  <text start="1200.72" dur="4.99">let&amp;#39;s create a path to do it so this had</text>
  <text start="1203.85" dur="5.939">never been done before we had to utilize</text>
  <text start="1205.71" dur="5.79">that rule in order to do it and and you</text>
  <text start="1209.789" dur="3.781">know Insano that so finally the</text>
  <text start="1211.5" dur="4.919">president you know it had to go to the</text>
  <text start="1213.57" dur="5.4">president which he could either approve</text>
  <text start="1216.419" dur="5.041">it or not approve it but we could have</text>
  <text start="1218.97" dur="4.29">still forced it out so that really is</text>
  <text start="1221.46" dur="5.459">the only way that we have in our rules</text>
  <text start="1223.26" dur="5.37">to get to declassify information now one</text>
  <text start="1226.919" dur="4.23">would argue we have the constitutional</text>
  <text start="1228.63" dur="3.96">right to take documents down to the</text>
  <text start="1231.149" dur="4.171">floor and read them into the</text>
  <text start="1232.59" dur="4.969">congressional record but you know none</text>
  <text start="1235.32" dur="6.3">of us wanted to take that chance because</text>
  <text start="1237.559" dur="6.191">you know as dirty as the cops were I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1241.62" dur="3.39">sure they would have tried to throw the</text>

  <text start="1245.01" dur="4.139">block us from getting this information</text>
  <text start="1246.36" dur="5.039">this information out and if you review</text>
  <text start="1249.149" dur="4.111">seriously consider doing that reading</text>
  <text start="1251.399" dur="3.481">some of this stuff on the floor oh it</text>
  <text start="1253.26" dur="4.889">was one yeah it was one of our</text>
  <text start="1254.88" dur="5.519">considerations for a long time and then</text>
  <text start="1258.149" dur="5.731">we found we finally got this process to</text>
  <text start="1260.399" dur="5.341">work in retrospect you know what we were</text>
  <text start="1263.88" dur="5.85">trying to do because of the criticism by</text>
  <text start="1265.74" dur="6.51">DOJ and FBI officials we try we actually</text>
  <text start="1269.73" dur="5.819">really slim this down to keep it as</text>
  <text start="1272.25" dur="6.09">narrow as possible and remember the</text>
  <text start="1275.549" dur="5.97">whole thing&amp;#39;s idiotic and I tried to say</text>
  <text start="1278.34" dur="5.73">this at the time but remember if it</text>
  <text start="1281.519" dur="5.311">wasn&amp;#39;t true then how could it be</text>
  <text start="1284.07" dur="5.219">declassified if it was never classified</text>
  <text start="1286.83" dur="3.87">in the first place then and if it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1289.289" dur="3.811">it true it would never would have been</text>
  <text start="1290.7" dur="4.439">classified so it was there it was</text>
  <text start="1293.1" dur="4.97">idiotic arguments all the way around</text>
  <text start="1295.139" dur="5.731">from the media and the the top officials</text>
  <text start="1298.07" dur="5.41">and the Democrats because they could</text>
  <text start="1300.87" dur="3.87">have just said well yeah go ahead and be</text>
  <text start="1303.48" dur="3.12">quiet but you know we don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1304.74" dur="5.279">declassify this because it doesn&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="1306.6" dur="5.309">right it was pretty simple but it</text>
  <text start="1310.019" dur="4.29">clearly existed we wrote it nice and</text>
  <text start="1311.909" dur="6.27">tight and and here&amp;#39;s another thing that</text>
  <text start="1314.309" dur="6.09">people forget the lawyers that the FBI</text>
  <text start="1318.179" dur="4.62">the FBI asked to see it before we went</text>
  <text start="1320.399" dur="4.891">through this process the lawyers did</text>
  <text start="1322.799" dur="3.811">from DOJ and FBI that came over were the</text>
  <text start="1325.29" dur="2.91">saying damn lawyers that were involved</text>
  <text start="1326.61" dur="4.14">in the FISA application process in the</text>
  <text start="1328.2" dur="4.14">first place so it was like it was like</text>

  <text start="1358.92" dur="5.07">busted for obstructing justice and and</text>
  <text start="1361.38" dur="4.5">lying to Congress there&amp;#39;s a lot of FBI</text>

  <text start="1402.15" dur="6.36">sufficient reckoning with the errors</text>

  <text start="1462.96" dur="3.63">is when you look back to all that kind</text>
  <text start="1464.639" dur="4.5">of reporting and commentary do you think</text>
  <text start="1466.59" dur="3.839">there&amp;#39;s been a sufficient reckoning in</text>
  <text start="1469.139" dur="2.9">the days since the release of the</text>
  <text start="1470.429" dur="5.041">horowitz report</text>

  <text start="1475.47" dur="3.659">there won&amp;#39;t be a reckoning but</text>
  <text start="1477.179" dur="2.551">essentially they&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="1479.129" dur="4.02">that</text>

  <text start="2528.019" dur="5.28">we go and thank you for giving us so</text>
  <text start="2529.519" dur="6.421">much time appreciate that and that</text>
  <text start="2533.299" dur="5.191">concerns the interviews that your</text>
  <text start="2535.94" dur="4.53">committee did and the question of the</text>
  <text start="2538.49" dur="7.02">whistleblower I have to say personally</text>
  <text start="2540.47" dur="6.93">if you told me that in mid-december the</text>
  <text start="2545.51" dur="5.37">identity of the whistleblower would</text>
  <text start="2547.4" dur="5.129">still be officially unknown I would have</text>
  <text start="2550.88" dur="3.929">been surprised I thought it would</text>
  <text start="2552.529" dur="6.81">probably come out in some way but it has</text>
  <text start="2554.809" dur="5.911">not now what was interesting is your</text>
  <text start="2559.339" dur="4.621">committee the Intelligence Committee</text>
  <text start="2560.72" dur="4.71">along with I think the the Oversight</text>
  <text start="2563.96" dur="3.42">Committee and the Foreign Relations</text>
  <text start="2565.43" dur="3.919">Committee</text>
  <text start="2567.38" dur="4.979">did a bunch of interviews these are the</text>
  <text start="2569.349" dur="5.68">17 interviews that were done now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2572.359" dur="4.5">done in secret down in this secure room</text>
  <text start="2575.029" dur="3.27">in the basement of the Capitol and all</text>
  <text start="2576.859" dur="4.801">of that we we talked quite a bit about</text>
  <text start="2578.299" dur="6.24">that and they were initially done in</text>
  <text start="2581.66" dur="5.09">secret but weeks later the chairman Adam</text>
  <text start="2584.539" dur="5.851">Schiff did release transcripts of them</text>
  <text start="2586.75" dur="5.259">except for one there&amp;#39;s one transcript</text>
  <text start="2590.39" dur="3.57">and that was of the interview with</text>
  <text start="2592.009" dur="3">Michael Atkinson who&amp;#39;s the inspector</text>
  <text start="2593.96" dur="6.99">general of the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="2595.009" dur="7.921">that remains secret and I just like you</text>
  <text start="2600.95" dur="5.76">to tell us what you know about that and</text>
  <text start="2602.93" dur="6.329">why is that well there&amp;#39;s yeah I alluded</text>
  <text start="2606.71" dur="5.25">to it a little bit ago but but maybe</text>
  <text start="2609.259" dur="5.85">I&amp;#39;ll be I&amp;#39;ll try to speak more more</text>
  <text start="2611.96" dur="7.53">clearly a more precise they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2615.109" dur="5.49">releasing that deposition or it was not</text>
  <text start="2619.49" dur="3.74">actually not a deposition it was a</text>
  <text start="2620.599" dur="6.061">briefing I was on the record briefing</text>
  <text start="2623.23" dur="5.139">because they know that Atkinson has some</text>
  <text start="2626.66" dur="3.149">real problems he will not be able to</text>
  <text start="2628.369" dur="3.21">answer that matter of fact I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="2629.809" dur="4.23">he could even sustain his job because</text>
  <text start="2631.579" dur="5.28">once that gets out he&amp;#39;s good you know</text>
  <text start="2634.039" dur="5.161">he&amp;#39;s going to look so foolish that you</text>
  <text start="2636.859" dur="4.44">know it doesn&amp;#39;t look like anything but</text>
  <text start="2639.2" dur="4.44">he was he was in on the whatever the</text>
  <text start="2641.299" dur="3.661">hell was going on well just so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2643.64" dur="3.389">why there&amp;#39;s not everybody that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="2644.96" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re not releasing just so everybody</text>
  <text start="2647.029" dur="5.851">can understand why can&amp;#39;t you talk about</text>
  <text start="2648.92" dur="6.359">it because it was it&amp;#39;s still it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="2652.88" dur="3.78">classified by rules of the Intelligence</text>
  <text start="2655.279" dur="3.001">Committee but you know but in each of</text>
  <text start="2656.66" dur="3.36">the 17</text>
  <text start="2658.28" dur="5.069">interviews that were originally secret</text>
  <text start="2660.02" dur="5.329">but we later got the transcripts at some</text>
  <text start="2663.349" dur="3.991">point in the beginning the chairman says</text>
  <text start="2665.349" dur="5.5">we&amp;#39;re doing this on an unclassified</text>
  <text start="2667.34" dur="7.2">basis right he&amp;#39;s something all of this</text>
  <text start="2670.849" dur="6.151">stuff was not classified and are you</text>
  <text start="2674.54" dur="3.9">saying that something concerning that</text>
  <text start="2677" dur="4.2">because of the rules of the committee</text>
  <text start="2678.44" dur="6.53">were classified no no because of the</text>
  <text start="2681.2" dur="6.12">rules of the committee it&amp;#39;s classified</text>
  <text start="2684.97" dur="6.28">it&amp;#39;s classified I think it&amp;#39;s a secret</text>
  <text start="2687.32" dur="6.75">level so until we until we you know</text>
  <text start="2691.25" dur="5.58">until we vote or to make them public we</text>
  <text start="2694.07" dur="4.61">can&amp;#39;t we we can&amp;#39;t do it and so you know</text>
  <text start="2696.83" dur="6.12">shifts going to keep those hidden and</text>
  <text start="2698.68" dur="6.97">they shouldn&amp;#39;t be and look at I mean we</text>
  <text start="2702.95" dur="4.53">we have a you know we Republicans you</text>
  <text start="2705.65" dur="4.11">know we are investigating Atkinson we</text>
  <text start="2707.48" dur="4.23">think he&amp;#39;s a he&amp;#39;s got a lot to answer</text>
  <text start="2709.76" dur="6.24">for we we sent him a very detailed</text>
  <text start="2711.71" dur="6.78">letter he sent us a a bogus letter back</text>
  <text start="2716" dur="4.94">didn&amp;#39;t answer any of our questions that</text>
  <text start="2718.49" dur="5.73">letter came from Kevin McCarthy myself</text>
  <text start="2720.94" dur="4.899">who&amp;#39;s the Republican leader McCarthy Jim</text>
  <text start="2724.22" dur="5.639">Jordan who&amp;#39;s the top Republican on</text>
  <text start="2725.839" dur="7.201">Oversight and myself we don&amp;#39;t like his</text>
  <text start="2729.859" dur="4.951">answers to the questions that we asked</text>
  <text start="2733.04" dur="4.319">and we have an active investigation and</text>
  <text start="2734.81" dur="5.82">going on him except that you know we</text>
  <text start="2737.359" dur="5.401">don&amp;#39;t have subpoena power so there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2740.63" dur="4.02">a lot we can we can do with it but you</text>
  <text start="2742.76" dur="4.17">know we we would like to be able to get</text>
  <text start="2744.65" dur="4.8">into position to present information to</text>
  <text start="2746.93" dur="3.84">the Department of Justice but you know</text>
  <text start="2749.45" dur="4.11">we can&amp;#39;t do that until we can interview</text>
  <text start="2750.77" dur="4.47">people do you think this transcript of</text>
  <text start="2753.56" dur="2.58">the Atkinson interview first of all is</text>
  <text start="2755.24" dur="3.18">there anything that&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="2756.14" dur="3.78">classified would it would it be any harm</text>
  <text start="2758.42" dur="1.949">to national security if it were released</text>

  <text start="2767.33" dur="8.7">public should know as the impeachment</text>
  <text start="2770.5" dur="7.93">trial is underway in the Senate yeah</text>
  <text start="2776.03" dur="3.96">definitely I mean not only that but I</text>

  <text start="2779.99" dur="5.43">should have to testify right okay so</text>
  <text start="2783.109" dur="3.931">somewhere somehow I mean it&amp;#39;s because</text>

  <text start="2805.25" dur="6">key is that you that you don&amp;#39;t suffer</text>
  <text start="2807.05" dur="7.11">any retribution right it has nothing to</text>
  <text start="2811.25" dur="5.04">do with that you get to keep your that</text>
  <text start="2814.16" dur="3.09">you get to remain anonymous especially</text>
  <text start="2816.29" dur="4.02">when you&amp;#39;re impeaching the president</text>
  <text start="2817.25" dur="4.71">United States so you know there needs to</text>
  <text start="2820.31" dur="4.5">be a full investigation to all of this</text>
