  <text start="402.39" dur="4.29">or 20 posts and then I make a video but</text>
  <text start="404.97" dur="4.32">in the mean time I do really deep</text>
  <text start="406.68" dur="4.02">research on it as if it needs it some of</text>
  <text start="409.29" dur="3.72">them are self explanatory you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="410.7" dur="5.9">really have to do all that much but I</text>

  <text start="458.25" dur="3.99">and law enforcement background gave me a</text>
  <text start="459.93" dur="3.36">little bit of an edge on it and so he</text>
  <text start="462.24" dur="2.82">said you know you&amp;#39;re really good at this</text>
  <text start="463.29" dur="4.74">you should definitely do this on YouTube</text>

  <text start="904.429" dur="4.111">believe that the depositions that we</text>
  <text start="906.589" dur="4.41">took I think we&amp;#39;re nearly about 70</text>
  <text start="908.54" dur="3.779">people those need to be published and</text>

  <text start="920.72" dur="3.809">were interviewed by us and that their</text>
  <text start="922.579" dur="3.99">answers to those questions I think full</text>
  <text start="924.529" dur="4.5">transparency is in order here so I</text>
  <text start="926.569" dur="4.681">expect to make those available from our</text>
  <text start="929.029" dur="4.441">committee to the American public here in</text>
  <text start="931.25" dur="3.99">the next few weeks so so let me just</text>
  <text start="933.47" dur="4.53">back here this is breaking news right</text>

  <text start="960.38" dur="3.36">Director of National Intelligence to</text>
  <text start="961.94" dur="3.99">declassify but we hope that that would</text>
  <text start="963.74" dur="3.81">only take a matter of days and they</text>
  <text start="965.93" dur="3.24">don&amp;#39;t do their normal foot dragging</text>
  <text start="967.55" dur="3.84">where they slow roll and we don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="969.17" dur="3.87">these before the election but but just</text>
  <text start="971.39" dur="4.68">for the sake of full transparency</text>

  <text start="2441.309" dur="4.8">across it here and so I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2442.66" dur="5.76">important enough to bring up now check</text>
  <text start="2446.109" dur="3.99">this out this gets really crazy so less</text>
  <text start="2448.42" dur="3.839">known but probably a far greater</text>
  <text start="2450.099" dur="5.041">importance is the CIA&amp;#39;s joint agency</text>
  <text start="2452.259" dur="6.871">task force also known as the fusion</text>

  <text start="2474.88" dur="6.449">those provoke proverbial dots would be</text>
  <text start="2477.069" dur="6.75">connected know to subvert the FISA</text>
  <text start="2481.329" dur="5.97">warrant application process and</text>
  <text start="2483.819" dur="8.79">basically do a reverse surveillance yeah</text>
  <text start="2487.299" dur="7.591">sane oh okay and then what Brennan was</text>
  <text start="2492.609" dur="4.771">outlining in the multi-agency task force</text>
  <text start="2494.89" dur="5.939">was referred to in this BBC article and</text>
  <text start="2497.38" dur="5.01">this is a mostly good article so believe</text>
  <text start="2500.829" dur="3.15">it or not from the BBC they tell on</text>
  <text start="2502.39" dur="3.329">themselves these mainstream media people</text>

  <text start="2522.67" dur="2.849">goes by a lot of different names but</text>
  <text start="2523.929" dur="4.29">this has been really kind of overlooked</text>
  <text start="2525.519" dur="3.501">in the media so I want to bring it to</text>
  <text start="2528.219" dur="2.811">your attention</text>

  <text start="2531.03" dur="4.35">get to the BBC article 2017</text>
  <text start="2533.64" dur="3.51">I had unresolved questions in my mind</text>
  <text start="2535.38" dur="5.39">about whether or not any of those u.s.</text>
  <text start="2537.15" dur="6.57">persons were working in support of the</text>
  <text start="2540.77" dur="4.96">Russian efforts and those were referred</text>

  <text start="2545.73" dur="2.85">persons referred to the FBI right we</text>
  <text start="2547.2" dur="4.11">call it incidental collection in terms</text>
  <text start="2548.58" dur="4.74">of CIA&amp;#39;s foreign intelligence collection</text>
  <text start="2551.31" dur="4.05">authorities any time we would</text>
  <text start="2553.32" dur="4.5">incidentally collect information on the</text>
  <text start="2555.36" dur="4.32">u.s. person we would hand that over to</text>
  <text start="2557.82" dur="4.11">the FBI because they have the legal</text>
  <text start="2559.68" dur="5.04">authorities to do it we would not pursue</text>
  <text start="2561.93" dur="5.13">that type of investigative you know so</text>
  <text start="2564.72" dur="5.19">the leads we would give it to the FBI so</text>
  <text start="2567.06" dur="4.98">we were picking things up that was of</text>
  <text start="2569.91" dur="3.39">great relevance to the FBI we want to</text>
  <text start="2572.04" dur="2.49">make sure that they were there so they</text>
  <text start="2573.3" dur="3.23">could piece it together with whatever</text>
  <text start="2574.53" dur="4.37">they were collecting domestically here</text>
  <text start="2576.53" dur="4.9">again it was an intelligence sharing</text>
  <text start="2578.9" dur="4.56">operation right we put together a fusion</text>
  <text start="2581.43" dur="4.38">center at CIA with a brought NSA and FBI</text>
  <text start="2583.46" dur="4">officers together with CIA to make sure</text>
