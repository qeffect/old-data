  <text start="406.23" dur="5.16">last time we saw Q post with the same</text>
  <text start="408.27" dur="4.56">trip code Q and if you look at them</text>

  <text start="422.7" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s the same trip code he&amp;#39;s able to use</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="4.38">but we can&amp;#39;t go by the identifier</text>
  <text start="427.23" dur="4.68">because everybody&amp;#39;s showing up with that</text>

  <text start="440.01" dur="5.64">the DoD thing here this has me like whoa</text>
  <text start="442.53" dur="5.37">okay so they they&amp;#39;re probably routing it</text>
  <text start="445.65" dur="4.74">through some DoD IP addresses I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="447.9" dur="7.02">sure but that&amp;#39;s just my guess I&amp;#39;m not a</text>
  <text start="450.39" dur="8.13">tech person but if you want the Unruh</text>
  <text start="454.92" dur="5.43">vote vote wrote a very nice article that</text>
  <text start="458.52" dur="3.96">goes through all of this stuff and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="460.35" dur="4.17">not gonna read his whole thing but he</text>
  <text start="462.48" dur="3.93">says the DoD route bit is telling</text>
  <text start="464.52" dur="3.75">because when we when the site was</text>
  <text start="466.41" dur="3.99">struggling to come back online in the</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="3.51">previous weeks various trace routes were</text>
  <text start="470.4" dur="5.13">showing the site was being routed</text>
  <text start="471.78" dur="6.47">through DoD own IP addresses and this is</text>
  <text start="475.53" dur="5.43">somebody for this is Frederick Brennan</text>
  <text start="478.25" dur="4.75">from Twitter and it says this might seem</text>
  <text start="480.96" dur="3.239">staying at first glance however I</text>
  <text start="483" dur="2.61">caution people to take it with a grain</text>
  <text start="484.199" dur="3.391">of salt the Department of Defense has a</text>
  <text start="485.61" dur="4.559">lot of IPs way more than they ever need</text>
  <text start="487.59" dur="3.99">a lot of networking providers use them</text>
  <text start="490.169" dur="4.62">in their internal networks which is</text>
  <text start="491.58" dur="5.73">totally legal and he shows where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="494.789" dur="4.85">interesting defense.gov shows up toward</text>
  <text start="497.31" dur="5.639">the end of an 8k Aitken traceroute</text>
  <text start="499.639" dur="6.31">originating from japan and it&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="502.949" dur="5.041">person you know hit hot tip to this</text>
  <text start="505.949" dur="5.671">person okay which I just showed you</text>
  <text start="507.99" dur="10.2">above United States defense Singapore so</text>
  <text start="511.62" dur="9.21">yeah I don&amp;#39;t know where okay so it says</text>
  <text start="518.19" dur="4.86">now this isn&amp;#39;t entirely uncommon ipv4</text>
  <text start="520.83" dur="4.98">has basically run out of addresses and</text>
  <text start="523.05" dur="5.31">the DoD UNH&amp;#39;s owns tons of them</text>
  <text start="525.81" dur="4.77">so networks use numbers ostensibly owned</text>
  <text start="528.36" dur="5.25">by the DoD to their own internal</text>
  <text start="530.58" dur="4.41">networks which they are free to do for</text>
  <text start="533.61" dur="2.13">the non technically in client which</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="3.87">would be me</text>
  <text start="535.74" dur="5.46">basically ipv4 is like phone numbers and</text>
  <text start="538.86" dur="4.62">we ran out of combinations all the phone</text>
  <text start="541.2" dur="4.11">numbers are in use and the government</text>
  <text start="543.48" dur="3.479">owns a bunch but if you were a company</text>
  <text start="545.31" dur="3.33">and only wanted to call people from</text>
  <text start="546.959" dur="3.841">within your own building you might use</text>
  <text start="548.64" dur="3.63">those same numbers owned by the</text>
  <text start="550.8" dur="3.72">government so long as you knew they were</text>
  <text start="552.27" dur="4.92">going to stay inside the building same</text>
  <text start="554.52" dur="5.46">thing roughly however this did plant a</text>
  <text start="557.19" dur="5.1">seed of doubt in the minds of yet people</text>
  <text start="559.98" dur="4.53">the other guy but anyway that&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="562.29" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;re not gonna we&amp;#39;re not gonna go over</text>

  <text start="575.94" dur="6.12">before we we&amp;#39;ve seen things where you</text>

  <text start="1175.53" dur="4.53">all valid because basically it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1178.2" dur="4.35">being able to see in the dark when there</text>
  <text start="1180.06" dur="4.11">is no light and so you can in one way</text>
  <text start="1182.55" dur="4.44">you could take it as though we were in</text>
  <text start="1184.17" dur="4.89">the dark and now we&amp;#39;re rigging for red</text>

  <text start="1189.06" dur="4.38">all gonna get on our battle stations and</text>
  <text start="1191.25" dur="4.17">rig for red which means get ready for</text>
  <text start="1193.44" dur="5.43">certain you know to be on the surface</text>
  <text start="1195.42" dur="4.95">which I&amp;#39;m let&amp;#39;s see I&amp;#39;ll leave this in</text>
  <text start="1198.87" dur="3.72">the link but this was a really good</text>
  <text start="1200.37" dur="5.6">explanation that I found it&amp;#39;s just um</text>
  <text start="1202.59" dur="6.12">what the it&amp;#39;s the USS Casmir Pulaski</text>
  <text start="1205.97" dur="6.13">which had to do with it had to do with</text>
  <text start="1208.71" dur="5.58">the story of a cold war warrior and they</text>
  <text start="1212.1" dur="4.08">have like all of all of the stuff okay</text>
  <text start="1214.29" dur="4.47">all of his like you know things and I</text>
  <text start="1216.18" dur="5.16">found here it says submarine operations</text>
  <text start="1218.76" dur="5.43">are performed with as much frequent sea</text>
  <text start="1221.34" dur="5.58">at night as during the day so some</text>
  <text start="1224.19" dur="4.86">Marines will you know or or naval people</text>
  <text start="1226.92" dur="3.48">will say you know whenever they do night</text>
  <text start="1229.05" dur="3.03">work they&amp;#39;re rigging for read and</text>
  <text start="1230.4" dur="3.48">whenever they do day work they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1232.08" dur="4.11">rigging for light but you know I you</text>
  <text start="1233.88" dur="4.62">know I don&amp;#39;t know how that goes but I</text>
  <text start="1236.19" dur="4.44">this is this is a good explanation so</text>
  <text start="1238.5" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re performed with as much frequency</text>
  <text start="1240.63" dur="4.35">at night as a day therefore it is</text>
  <text start="1242.79" dur="5.07">important to rig the control room and</text>
  <text start="1244.98" dur="5.01">other spaces for read the process of</text>
  <text start="1247.86" dur="4.95">rigging for read is to turn off all</text>
  <text start="1249.99" dur="5.49">lights except red lamps this keeps one</text>
  <text start="1252.81" dur="4.62">eyes accustomed to the dark for time</text>
  <text start="1255.48" dur="4.26">periods when it will be necessary to</text>
  <text start="1257.43" dur="4.26">operate with the lights off the need for</text>
  <text start="1259.74" dur="3.3">a flashlight to carry out tasks is</text>
  <text start="1261.69" dur="4.56">coupled with the need for maintaining</text>
  <text start="1263.04" dur="5.13">rig for red integrity the submarine pen</text>
  <text start="1266.25" dur="4.53">light has a rotating black barrel at the</text>
  <text start="1268.17" dur="4.86">tip which contains a red filter turning</text>
  <text start="1270.78" dur="5.46">the barrel changes the beam from white</text>
  <text start="1273.03" dur="5.85">to red to enable operations during rig</text>
  <text start="1276.24" dur="5.49">for red operations the light itself is</text>
  <text start="1278.88" dur="6.419">constructed out of a brass tube etc okay</text>
  <text start="1281.73" dur="5.699">so basically rigging for red means like</text>
  <text start="1285.299" dur="5.521">you know your rigging in the control</text>
  <text start="1287.429" dur="5.281">room for night work dark light you know</text>
  <text start="1290.82" dur="3.75">for in the dark so when the light comes</text>
  <text start="1292.71" dur="4.14">your eyes don&amp;#39;t have to be as much</text>
  <text start="1294.57" dur="5.459">adjusted it keeps them it keeps one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1296.85" dur="4.679">eyes accustomed to dark for time periods</text>
  <text start="1300.029" dur="5.341">when it will be necessary to operate</text>
  <text start="1301.529" dur="5.851">with the lights off so you know it has a</text>
  <text start="1305.37" dur="3.63">double edge meaning there I think it was</text>
  <text start="1307.38" dur="3.33">meant you know and I&amp;#39;ve heard a lot of</text>
  <text start="1309" dur="3.75">interpretations already it&amp;#39;s all you</text>
  <text start="1310.71" dur="4.469">know everybody has her but I think it</text>
  <text start="1312.75" dur="5.97">was for for us in one way to keep our</text>
  <text start="1315.179" dur="5.761">lights Rhett you know to keep our eyes</text>
  <text start="1318.72" dur="4.29">accustomed to the dark times work he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1320.94" dur="4.05">not posting when it will be necessary</text>
  <text start="1323.01" dur="4.47">for opera us to operate with the lights</text>
  <text start="1324.99" dur="4.47">off we&amp;#39;re rigging for red okay then I</text>
  <text start="1327.48" dur="4.049">also think because there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="1329.46" dur="5.01">definition about how they&amp;#39;ll go rig for</text>
  <text start="1331.529" dur="5.311">red when a submarine is about to make</text>
  <text start="1334.47" dur="5.4">you know come up to surface or periscope</text>
  <text start="1336.84" dur="5.16">level or above the water that would be Q</text>
  <text start="1339.87" dur="6">is coming back I thought this was</text>
  <text start="1342" dur="6.72">interesting right here this is a compass</text>
  <text start="1345.87" dur="4.82">right lensatic compass this is and it</text>
  <text start="1348.72" dur="4.049">says the standard the standard</text>
  <text start="1350.69" dur="5.05">military-issued lensatic engineers</text>
  <text start="1352.769" dur="5.311">compass was a standard issue and it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="1355.74" dur="5.039">the escape kit and came stored in the</text>
  <text start="1358.08" dur="5.699">common olive drab canvas utility pouch</text>
  <text start="1360.779" dur="5.071">the pouch has an ALICE clip on the back</text>
  <text start="1363.779" dur="4.921">just thought that was cool while I was</text>
  <text start="1365.85" dur="6">reading this you know Alice okay anyway</text>
  <text start="1368.7" dur="5.01">um this is this is it here but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1371.85" dur="5.76">really talking about read this rig for</text>
  <text start="1373.71" dur="5.67">red okay so this is another explanation</text>
  <text start="1377.61" dur="3.809">from the UM revolt he says when the USS</text>
  <text start="1379.38" dur="4.44">Dallas submerges to attack the Red</text>
  <text start="1381.419" dur="4.321">October in the Hunt for Red October they</text>
  <text start="1383.82" dur="4.319">rigged the battle stations as well as</text>
  <text start="1385.74" dur="4.2">rig for red rig for red is a common</text>
  <text start="1388.139" dur="3.9">command using the control room it&amp;#39;s used</text>
  <text start="1389.94" dur="4.709">when the boat is going to be servicing</text>
  <text start="1392.039" dur="4.98">or coming to periscope depth at night</text>
  <text start="1394.649" dur="4.53">the purpose is to give the lookouts</text>
  <text start="1397.019" dur="4.591">heads up for their eyes to adjust to the</text>
  <text start="1399.179" dur="6.62">darkness so he says great everyone on</text>
  <text start="1401.61" dur="7.23">cue ion is coming to the surface yeah so</text>
  <text start="1405.799" dur="3.941">I just wanted to read that to you</text>
  <text start="1408.84" dur="3.03">because I thought that was a good</text>
  <text start="1409.74" dur="4.83">explanation too and you can see those</text>
