  <text start="495.759" dur="4.53">involved in a conspiracy meanwhile he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="498.129" dur="4.89">working for Western intelligence miss</text>
  <text start="500.289" dur="5.1">foot is that&amp;#39;s what his lawyer says and</text>
  <text start="503.019" dur="4.35">I know both John Durham and two members</text>
  <text start="505.389" dur="3.84">of two different committees in Congress</text>
  <text start="507.369" dur="3.45">have recently reached out to get this</text>

  <text start="513.459" dur="3.781">gave his lawyer before he went into</text>
  <text start="514.959" dur="3.781">hiding so there&amp;#39;s a lot of evidence that</text>
  <text start="517.24" dur="4.289">can be combed through we can get to the</text>
  <text start="518.74" dur="4.769">bottom of this but the I think the bar</text>
  <text start="521.529" dur="3.3">durum investigation is looking much more</text>
  <text start="523.509" dur="3.211">intensively at a period that hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="524.829" dur="3.331">gotten much scrutiny in the American</text>

  <text start="1058.7" dur="3.48">the Trump campaign that&amp;#39;s right so</text>
  <text start="1059.84" dur="5.04">Mifsud is important because he is the</text>

  <text start="1068.54" dur="7.23">he since denied that but molar and with</text>

  <text start="1080.33" dur="5.19">not the case and in fact we know that he</text>
  <text start="1083.18" dur="4.68">was in the US Capitol just months into</text>
  <text start="1085.52" dur="4.56">the Russia investigation just steps away</text>
  <text start="1087.86" dur="4.62">from the House Intelligence Committee so</text>
  <text start="1090.08" dur="4.08">we sent a letter a few weeks ago I think</text>
  <text start="1092.48" dur="3.18">the heads of these agencies thought that</text>
  <text start="1094.16" dur="3.48">they were that we were just going to be</text>
  <text start="1095.66" dur="4.59">ignored so we sent a follow-up letter on</text>

  <text start="1103.4" dur="5.94">guess which agency is not cooperating I</text>
  <text start="1106.6" dur="5.62">could take a guess that&amp;#39;s the FBI&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1109.34" dur="4.74">cooperating per usual which means</text>
  <text start="1112.22" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;ve got something to hide because it</text>
  <text start="1114.08" dur="4.8">is impossible that Mifsud professor</text>
  <text start="1117.02" dur="4.05">Mifsud is a Russian asset he was a</text>

  <text start="1123.11" dur="4.5">and taught FBI trained FBI officials and</text>
  <text start="1126.29" dur="3.51">worked with FBI officials so your whole</text>
  <text start="1127.61" dur="4.08">point is that there could be very weak</text>
  <text start="1129.8" dur="4.47">if the case was promised upon him it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1131.69" dur="4.02">on it&amp;#39;s on weak ground now I want to</text>

  <text start="1154.97" dur="4.92">ever made public okay do you know what</text>

  <text start="1163.67" dur="3.8">we have had what we call the five</text>
  <text start="1165.5" dur="4.86">buckets of information that we want</text>
  <text start="1167.47" dur="4.96">Declassified one of those buckets which</text>
  <text start="1170.36" dur="4.34">I believe former congressman Gowdy</text>
  <text start="1172.43" dur="5.45">former chairman Gowdy is referring to is</text>
  <text start="1174.7" dur="5.56">exculpatory evidence on Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="1177.88" dur="4.33">that really does need to get out it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1180.26" dur="3.75">one of many things that need to get out</text>
  <text start="1182.21" dur="4.26">but you know as it relates he talks</text>
  <text start="1184.01" dur="4.65">about informants there now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1186.47" dur="5.07">believe that Mifsud is is a Russian</text>
  <text start="1188.66" dur="5.43">agent but I do believe that Mifsud is an</text>
  <text start="1191.54" dur="4.71">agent of someone and you know that we</text>
  <text start="1194.09" dur="3.96">still don&amp;#39;t know you know the origins of</text>
  <text start="1196.25" dur="2.59">that and so I don&amp;#39;t know if Trey&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1198.05" dur="2.38">talking about that</text>
  <text start="1198.84" dur="3.84">but that is one of the questions it</text>
  <text start="1200.43" dur="3.75">wouldn&amp;#39;t matter if these agencies say he</text>
  <text start="1202.68" dur="3.57">was kind of the linchpin to getting this</text>
  <text start="1204.18" dur="4.14">whole thing started well look let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1206.25" dur="3.45">imagine he&amp;#39;s not a Russian asset let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1208.32" dur="3.42">let&amp;#39;s throw that away even though Muller</text>
  <text start="1209.7" dur="3.66">has said that he that he was but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1211.74" dur="3.75">say that he was working for another</text>
  <text start="1213.36" dur="5.13">foreign government or let&amp;#39;s say that he</text>
  <text start="1215.49" dur="7.83">was working for some organization that</text>
  <text start="1218.49" dur="8.16">was hired by an either a spy agency or a</text>
  <text start="1223.32" dur="4.29">contractor or possibly a campaign so</text>
  <text start="1226.65" dur="2.97">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re trying to get to the</text>
  <text start="1227.61" dur="3.63">bottom of is who is this josef Mifsud</text>
  <text start="1229.62" dur="3.57">character because he seems to have a lot</text>
  <text start="1231.24" dur="3.54">of connections with a lot of other</text>
  <text start="1233.19" dur="4.05">people like Christopher Steele and</text>
  <text start="1234.78" dur="5.03">others that were involved in the early</text>
  <text start="1237.24" dur="4.59">stages and wrote of course the infamous</text>
  <text start="1239.81" dur="3.79">are you confident with the three</text>
  <text start="1241.83" dur="3.21">investigations that we know of publicly</text>
  <text start="1243.6" dur="2.58">the two US attorneys who are looking</text>
  <text start="1245.04" dur="2.4">into the origins one of them</text>
  <text start="1246.18" dur="3.09">specifically at the direction of the</text>
  <text start="1247.44" dur="3.06">Attorney General and also the inspector</text>
  <text start="1249.27" dur="3.03">general at the Justice Department are</text>
  <text start="1250.5" dur="3.63">you confident that as those</text>
  <text start="1252.3" dur="3.3">investigations play out two of them of</text>
  <text start="1254.13" dur="3.6">the three we hear we may get within</text>
  <text start="1255.6" dur="4.47">weeks will give us answers about the</text>
  <text start="1257.73" dur="4.56">origin either clear the FBI or raise</text>
  <text start="1260.07" dur="4.83">some questions about what happened so I</text>
  <text start="1262.29" dur="4.05">am confident in our investigation that</text>
  <text start="1264.9" dur="3">we have done so we&amp;#39;ve sent eight</text>
  <text start="1266.34" dur="3.15">criminal referrals to the Department of</text>
  <text start="1267.9" dur="4.77">Justice likely we&amp;#39;re going to have more</text>
  <text start="1269.49" dur="5.4">maybe later this week I do I&amp;#39;m impressed</text>
  <text start="1272.67" dur="4.2">with the new attorney general I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1274.89" dur="3.39">know the US Attorney in Connecticut but</text>
  <text start="1276.87" dur="3.09">everyone says that he&amp;#39;s going to do a</text>
  <text start="1278.28" dur="3.87">good job but you know I can&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1279.96" dur="4.11">answer that question until we meet with</text>
  <text start="1282.15" dur="4.7">him we talk about our concerns but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1284.07" dur="5.22">pretty sure once you tracked down the</text>
  <text start="1286.85" dur="4.96">basically information that we have put</text>
  <text start="1289.29" dur="5.28">together in a nice package it would be</text>
  <text start="1291.81" dur="5.28">impossible not for four people not to be</text>
  <text start="1294.57" dur="3.66">prosecuted well a lot of people a lot of</text>
  <text start="1297.09" dur="2.61">people are talking now and a lot of</text>
  <text start="1298.23" dur="3.42">people seem like they want to get their</text>
  <text start="1299.7" dur="3.18">side of the story out before the rest of</text>
  <text start="1301.65" dur="4.79">these reports come so we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
