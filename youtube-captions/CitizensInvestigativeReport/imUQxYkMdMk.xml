  <text start="1296.65" dur="5.91">exactly did they do that well that is</text>
  <text start="1300.91" dur="4.56">something that&amp;#39;s going to have to wait</text>
  <text start="1302.56" dur="5.64">further discussion - but I think once we</text>
  <text start="1305.47" dur="5.01">outline the timeline of all of it that</text>
  <text start="1308.2" dur="4.35">will become apparent - of Muller&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1320.47" dur="4.83">about this in columns these are two</text>
  <text start="1323.11" dur="6.42">people on the Special Counsel team and</text>
  <text start="1325.3" dur="4.68">yet way back in 2016 they were the part</text>

  <text start="1352.48" dur="7.14">in the Muller witch-hunt but the</text>
  <text start="1355.69" dur="6.09">legitimacy of that investigation it</text>
  <text start="1359.62" dur="4.439">certainly raises a lot of questions that</text>
  <text start="1361.78" dur="4.41">need to be answered I do not understand</text>
  <text start="1364.059" dur="4.351">how they could have participated in the</text>

  <text start="1377.11" dur="3.87">in the chain of command and Department</text>
  <text start="1378.82" dur="4.62">of Justice to be involved so they were</text>
  <text start="1380.98" dur="4.319">part of some kind of small group that</text>
  <text start="1383.44" dur="4.05">was in on all of it and then they wound</text>
  <text start="1385.299" dur="4.971">up on the Special Counsel prosecution</text>
  <text start="1387.49" dur="5.25">and mrs. Ahmad Ahmad particularly is</text>

  <text start="1392.74" dur="4.25">they take it and contaminated the</text>
  <text start="1394.6" dur="4.53">legitimacy of Robert Muller&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1402.09" dur="9.79">prosecutors believe li handed over 330</text>
  <text start="1407.35" dur="6.99">pages of evidence in the case to you I</text>
  <text start="1411.88" dur="4.5">mean it&amp;#39;s unbelievable to me that in</text>
  <text start="1414.34" dur="4.709">just two weeks ago they finally caught</text>
  <text start="1416.38" dur="4.32">this stuff up and yet at the same time</text>
  <text start="1419.049" dur="4.471">they claim it&amp;#39;s not exculpatory</text>
  <text start="1420.7" dur="5.43">information are you of the opinion that</text>
  <text start="1423.52" dur="7.22">they are so biased they can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1426.13" dur="7.02">distinguish exculpatory from inculpatory</text>
  <text start="1430.74" dur="4.36">well I think as a matter of general</text>
  <text start="1433.15" dur="4.05">principle dealing with prosecutors as</text>
  <text start="1435.1" dur="4.41">long as I have now particularly in the</text>
  <text start="1437.2" dur="4.349">last 20 years when the entire standard</text>
  <text start="1439.51" dur="4.26">for conduct a prosecutor seems to have</text>
  <text start="1441.549" dur="4.591">changed it shouldn&amp;#39;t be up to the</text>
  <text start="1443.77" dur="4.77">prosecutor to decide what is exculpatory</text>
  <text start="1446.14" dur="4.47">to the defense that&amp;#39;s why the Supreme</text>
  <text start="1448.54" dur="4.11">Court in auger said the prosecutors</text>
  <text start="1450.61" dur="3.51">shouldn&amp;#39;t tack too close to the wind if</text>
  <text start="1452.65" dur="3.93">they do they need to hand it over</text>
  <text start="1454.12" dur="5.64">because only the defense can really</text>
  <text start="1456.58" dur="4.92">decide what is material and important to</text>
  <text start="1459.76" dur="3.57">the defense the prosecutors don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1461.5" dur="2.4">what all the defenses are I mean this</text>
  <text start="1463.33" dur="2.61">case</text>
  <text start="1463.9" dur="4.89">exemplifies everything that&amp;#39;s wrong with</text>
  <text start="1465.94" dur="5.28">our criminal justice system and how many</text>
  <text start="1468.79" dur="4.53">reforms are needed to make sure that</text>
  <text start="1471.22" dur="4.05">everyone gets a fair trial one of the</text>
  <text start="1473.32" dur="4.11">reasons I so applauded judge Sullivan</text>
  <text start="1475.27" dur="3.96">and he was a judicial hero of my book is</text>
  <text start="1477.43" dur="4.47">because he was willing to hold</text>
  <text start="1479.23" dur="4.35">prosecutors to account to produce all</text>
  <text start="1481.9" dur="4.11">the evidence that&amp;#39;s favorable to the</text>
  <text start="1483.58" dur="4.8">defense you know all of this arises</text>
  <text start="1486.01" dur="5.19">because Michael Flynn agreed to under</text>
  <text start="1488.38" dur="5.67">pressure and he was basically fooled</text>
  <text start="1491.2" dur="6.06">into giving an interview with Peter</text>
  <text start="1494.05" dur="8.19">Strock and another agent which is we all</text>
  <text start="1497.26" dur="8.1">now know as jokey ANCA and what&amp;#39;s a and</text>
  <text start="1502.24" dur="6.57">the special counsel accused Flynn of</text>
  <text start="1505.36" dur="9.45">line in that interview and yet here is</text>
  <text start="1508.81" dur="8.19">the FBI report dated July 19 2017 we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1514.81" dur="4.89">put it on the screen throughout the</text>
  <text start="1517" dur="5.31">interview Flynn had a very sure demeanor</text>
  <text start="1519.7" dur="6.06">and did not give any indicators of</text>
  <text start="1522.31" dur="6.09">deception struck and redacted FBI agent</text>
  <text start="1525.76" dur="5.34">which is Pianka both had the impression</text>
  <text start="1528.4" dur="5.82">at the time that Flynn was not lying or</text>
  <text start="1531.1" dur="5.43">did not think he was lying how is it</text>
  <text start="1534.22" dur="5.61">possible that Flynn can be charged with</text>
  <text start="1536.53" dur="7.67">lying if the two FBI agents who</text>
  <text start="1539.83" dur="7.08">interviewed him concluded he was not I</text>
  <text start="1544.2" dur="5.67">still don&amp;#39;t understand that myself Greg</text>
  <text start="1546.91" dur="6.51">that&amp;#39;s why I need a lot more information</text>
  <text start="1549.87" dur="8.08">are you considering withdrawing the</text>
  <text start="1553.42" dur="7.92">guilty plea that is not what I want to</text>
  <text start="1557.95" dur="5.81">see happen here I&amp;#39;m expecting frankly</text>
  <text start="1561.34" dur="4.71">that we find evidence that warrants</text>
  <text start="1563.76" dur="5.32">dismissal of the case for egregious</text>
  <text start="1566.05" dur="5.07">government misconduct but like I said I</text>
  <text start="1569.08" dur="3.69">want to know the truth that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="1571.12" dur="3.57">want to know first and I can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1572.77" dur="3.66">evaluate the validity of the plea until</text>
  <text start="1574.69" dur="4.02">I have all the evidence in other words</text>
  <text start="1576.43" dur="4.97">you want to lay out all of the evidence</text>
  <text start="1578.71" dur="5.88">and then the judge on his own saying</text>
  <text start="1581.4" dur="4.93">prosecutors on the special counsel team</text>
  <text start="1584.59" dur="4.35">you were unconscionable you were</text>
  <text start="1586.33" dur="5.25">unprincipled you violated the brady</text>
  <text start="1588.94" dur="4.98">rules and because of your egregious</text>
  <text start="1591.58" dur="4.38">misconduct I&amp;#39;m dismissing the case</text>
  <text start="1593.92" dur="3.69">against Flynn would that be the optimal</text>
  <text start="1595.96" dur="4.14">result</text>
  <text start="1597.61" dur="4.65">that would be the optimal result the man</text>
  <text start="1600.1" dur="4.74">I believe from everything I&amp;#39;ve seen now</text>
  <text start="1602.26" dur="5.31">should be completely exonerated all</text>
  <text start="1604.84" dur="6.27">right Sydney pal good luck to you thank</text>
