  <text start="14.639" dur="3.991">former congressman and Fox News</text>

  <text start="18.63" dur="2.899">you so much for joining I served with</text>
  <text start="19.859" dur="3.691">both of you in the Congress a</text>
  <text start="21.529" dur="4.811">congressman Ratcliffe you were a former</text>
  <text start="23.55" dur="4.469">US Attorney trey Gowdy and I served with</text>
  <text start="26.34" dur="2.82">you we both abandoned you and left you</text>
  <text start="28.019" dur="3.811">there to your lonesome</text>
  <text start="29.16" dur="4.14">there on the Judiciary Committee but my</text>
  <text start="31.83" dur="3.389">understanding is that you&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="33.3" dur="3.689">discussion with the Inspector General</text>
  <text start="35.219" dur="5.25">just a few days ago tell us what</text>
  <text start="36.989" dur="5.07">happened and what transpired Jason tried</text>
  <text start="40.469" dur="2.52">good to see both of you yeah I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="42.059" dur="4.291">have the opportunity to meet with</text>
  <text start="42.989" dur="5.311">Inspector General Horowitz last week we</text>
  <text start="46.35" dur="3.63">talked about his report the timing of</text>
  <text start="48.3" dur="4.23">his report not the content and he</text>
  <text start="49.98" dur="4.2">related that his team&amp;#39;s investigative</text>
  <text start="52.53" dur="3.66">work is complete and they&amp;#39;re now in the</text>
  <text start="54.18" dur="4.08">process of drafting that report so I</text>
  <text start="56.19" dur="3.599">would expect that it will be a draft of</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="3.029">that will be completed in short order I</text>
  <text start="59.789" dur="3.65">will tell you though Jason I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="61.289" dur="5.881">expect that any of us are gonna see it</text>
  <text start="63.439" dur="6.491">anytime real soon he did relate that as</text>
  <text start="67.17" dur="5.699">much as 20% of his report is probably</text>
  <text start="69.93" dur="5.28">going to include classified information</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="4.591">so that draft report will have to</text>
  <text start="75.21" dur="4.94">undergo a classification review at the</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="5.22">FBI and at the Department of Justice so</text>
  <text start="80.15" dur="4.63">while I&amp;#39;m you know hopeful that we might</text>
  <text start="82.68" dur="4.95">see it before members of Congress recess</text>
  <text start="84.78" dur="4.979">for the August recess I&amp;#39;m not too</text>
  <text start="87.63" dur="3.629">certain about that this is always the</text>
  <text start="89.759" dur="3.57">frustrating thing it&amp;#39;s happened multiple</text>
  <text start="91.259" dur="3.481">times where we had reports when I was</text>
  <text start="93.329" dur="3.271">the chairman when trey Gowdy was the</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="3.989">chairman the Department of Justice would</text>
  <text start="96.6" dur="4.589">review things for weeks on end if not</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="4.201">months but it is encouraging note of the</text>
  <text start="101.189" dur="3.151">Inspector General is going to be right</text>
  <text start="102.93" dur="4.979">there around the corner</text>
  <text start="104.34" dur="6">congressman Gowdy I got to tell you you</text>
  <text start="107.909" dur="4.411">have a very definitive James Comey who</text>
  <text start="110.34" dur="3.779">thinks he did everything by the book and</text>
  <text start="112.32" dur="3.99">that he did everything that he was</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="3.991">supposed to but you and congressman</text>
  <text start="116.31" dur="3.949">Ratcliffe are the two people that I know</text>
  <text start="118.11" dur="7.109">of that have actually reviewed the FISA</text>
  <text start="120.259" dur="6.911">unredacted the FISA reports is director</text>
  <text start="125.219" dur="3.121">Comey right is this just all for nothing</text>
  <text start="127.17" dur="5.13">because he did everything the way it was</text>
  <text start="128.34" dur="5">supposed to JC I just want to make sure</text>
  <text start="132.3" dur="4.04">that we have the</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="6.57">the the the right James Comey is after</text>
  <text start="136.34" dur="5.91">Comey that road he didn&amp;#39;t leak in a memo</text>
  <text start="139.91" dur="4.23">that he later leaked is that the James</text>
  <text start="142.25" dur="4.14">Comey that said he didn&amp;#39;t do weasel</text>
  <text start="144.14" dur="4.71">things while he was memorializing what</text>
  <text start="146.39" dur="4.23">he said was a private conversation is</text>
  <text start="148.85" dur="3.57">that the same James Comey that said the</text>
  <text start="150.62" dur="4.11">FBI didn&amp;#39;t give a hoot about politics</text>
  <text start="152.42" dur="4.59">while two of his senior aides spent the</text>
  <text start="154.73" dur="3.63">better part of the year discussing two</text>
  <text start="157.01" dur="4.02">political candidates that they were</text>
  <text start="158.36" dur="4.5">supposed to be investigating yeah I</text>
  <text start="161.03" dur="4.26">think the same James Comey the one that</text>
  <text start="162.86" dur="4.68">you just played it it&amp;#39;s just the same</text>
  <text start="165.29" dur="3.479">one yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s the same one that</text>
  <text start="167.54" dur="4.44">took advantage of the Trump</text>
  <text start="168.769" dur="5.22">administration by sending FBI agents to</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="4.41">interview Michael Flynn while I let</text>
  <text start="173.989" dur="4.201">Hillary Clinton have a small law firm</text>
  <text start="176.39" dur="3.81">when she was interviewed I just want to</text>
  <text start="178.19" dur="4.47">make sure it&amp;#39;s the same James Comey I</text>
  <text start="180.2" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t know what Horowitz is gonna find I</text>
  <text start="182.66" dur="4.47">have a lot of confidence enemies the</text>
  <text start="184.64" dur="5.19">straight arrow he&amp;#39;s just looking at the</text>
  <text start="187.13" dur="4.53">FISA abuse United States Attorney John</text>
  <text start="189.83" dur="4.56">Durham is looking at what happened and</text>
  <text start="191.66" dur="4.62">the late winter in spring of 2016 so</text>
  <text start="194.39" dur="3.659">your viewers have to have kind of a line</text>
  <text start="196.28" dur="4.049">of demarcation just remember Peter</text>
  <text start="198.049" dur="5.481">struck if that name sounds familiar and</text>
  <text start="200.329" dur="5.491">late July 2016 initiates a</text>
  <text start="203.53" dur="4.69">counterintelligence investigation into</text>
  <text start="205.82" dur="4.44">the Trump campaign that&amp;#39;s July of 2016</text>
  <text start="208.22" dur="4.47">Horowitz is looking at the faisal</text>
  <text start="210.26" dur="4.38">process after that durum is looking at</text>
  <text start="212.69" dur="4.47">the origins of the russia investigation</text>
  <text start="214.64" dur="4.47">prior to that and i&amp;#39;m hopeful that those</text>
  <text start="217.16" dur="4.919">two investigations together will shed a</text>
  <text start="219.11" dur="5.189">lot of light so America can know what</text>
  <text start="222.079" dur="4.47">happened and then move on because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.299" dur="4.261">been a really divisive two years no it</text>
  <text start="226.549" dur="4.621">has in congressman Ratcliffe again</text>
  <text start="228.56" dur="4.83">you&amp;#39;ve been a US Attorney i you and trey</text>
  <text start="231.17" dur="4.71">gowdy have reviews the reviewed the FISA</text>
  <text start="233.39" dur="4.17">reports it says verified at the top and</text>
  <text start="235.88" dur="3.9">I guess maybe if they want to debate</text>
  <text start="237.56" dur="4.95">what verified means but you&amp;#39;ve actually</text>
  <text start="239.78" dur="4.5">looked at the unredacted reports Comey</text>
  <text start="242.51" dur="2.94">says he did everything right you two</text>
  <text start="244.28" dur="3.78">have looked at it and said it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="245.45" dur="5.28">wrong but that it was potentially done</text>
  <text start="248.06" dur="4.98">poorly and wrong and and deceptively and</text>
  <text start="250.73" dur="4.74">maybe exculpatory information was left</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="4.65">out is Horowitz going to be the</text>
  <text start="255.47" dur="5.819">definitive word what is his role in this</text>
  <text start="257.69" dur="5.49">process I think he&amp;#39;s going to be one of</text>
  <text start="261.289" dur="3.241">the more important voices and a lot of</text>
  <text start="263.18" dur="3.99">folks are looking forward to Bob</text>
  <text start="264.53" dur="3.99">Muller&amp;#39;s testimony on July 17th</text>
  <text start="267.17" dur="2.88">that&amp;#39;s coming up but Bob Muller is going</text>
  <text start="268.52" dur="3.12">to talk about collusion that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="270.05" dur="5.67">exist about obstruction that the</text>
  <text start="271.64" dur="6.54">Attorney General found didn&amp;#39;t exist you</text>
  <text start="275.72" dur="3.63">can ask Bob Muller ten times in ten</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="2.7">different languages and I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="279.35" dur="2.4">there gonna be any new facts I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="280.88" dur="4.8">think they&amp;#39;re gonna be any new</text>
  <text start="281.75" dur="5.7">conclusions but Michael Horowitz and his</text>
  <text start="285.68" dur="3">findings and John Durham and his</text>
  <text start="287.45" dur="3.96">findings those are going to be</text>
  <text start="288.68" dur="5.19">significant those were late not to trump</text>
  <text start="291.41" dur="6.06">misconduct but to potential Obama</text>
  <text start="293.87" dur="5.31">misconduct look you know Jim Comey says</text>
  <text start="297.47" dur="3.3">they did everything right even though as</text>
  <text start="299.18" dur="3.96">tre pointed out you know you&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="7.14">the lead investigator who promised to</text>
  <text start="303.14" dur="7.86">stop Trump wanted to prevent him from</text>
  <text start="307.91" dur="6.48">becoming president he had a deputy</text>
  <text start="311" dur="5.07">director who lied under oath on multiple</text>
  <text start="314.39" dur="4.29">occasions and was criminally referred</text>
  <text start="316.07" dur="5.43">and his trade pointed out director Comey</text>
  <text start="318.68" dur="4.47">himself leaked private conversations</text>
  <text start="321.5" dur="2.79">with the president you know he has a</text>
  <text start="323.15" dur="2.55">different parent Lee a different</text>
  <text start="324.29" dur="2.82">definition of the word proud when he</text>
  <text start="325.7" dur="2.94">says he&amp;#39;s proud of all that work but</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;ll find out Michael Horowitz I do</text>
  <text start="328.64" dur="6.27">think his findings will be significant</text>
  <text start="332.06" dur="4.97">Jason because it potent it presents a</text>
  <text start="334.91" dur="5.13">real potential problem for the Democrats</text>
  <text start="337.03" dur="4.83">right now we already know Bob Muller has</text>
  <text start="340.04" dur="4.8">told us that a Democratic administration</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="5.38">started an investigation into conspiracy</text>
  <text start="344.84" dur="3.39">with Russia that did not exist that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="3.3">bad enough</text>
  <text start="348.23" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;d be a whole lot worse if it turns</text>
  <text start="350.54" dur="3.27">out that that same Democratic</text>
  <text start="352.04" dur="4.29">administration continued that</text>
  <text start="353.81" dur="5.52">investigation by breaking rules at the</text>
  <text start="356.33" dur="5.52">FISA Court if that happens you can</text>
  <text start="359.33" dur="4.35">pretty much put a pin in any impeachment</text>
  <text start="361.85" dur="4.02">balloon because be hard for the</text>
  <text start="363.68" dur="4.05">Democrats to say well we start an</text>
  <text start="365.87" dur="3.63">investigation that we shouldn&amp;#39;t have we</text>
  <text start="367.73" dur="3.84">continued it by breaking the rules but</text>
  <text start="369.5" dur="4.2">we want to impeach a president for</text>
  <text start="371.57" dur="3.57">trying to obstruct that investigation</text>
  <text start="373.7" dur="3.72">that never should have started</text>

  <text start="574.75" dur="3.03">to do okay</text>
  <text start="575.83" dur="3.9">is we gonna give it a couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="577.78" dur="4.23">and if by mid-july we don&amp;#39;t see</text>

  <text start="626.98" dur="4.47">and the FBI to burry their institutional</text>
  <text start="630.25" dur="3.48">corruption has been the use of</text>

  <text start="633.73" dur="5.25">while the information from Radcliffe is</text>
  <text start="635.98" dur="4.83">obviously limited it sounds like the DOJ</text>
  <text start="638.98" dur="4.41">and FBI will have an opportunity to</text>
  <text start="640.81" dur="4.92">consider continue hiding the information</text>

  <text start="793.089" dur="4.86">the troublesome phase the administrative</text>

  <text start="836.73" dur="4.23">principles cannot divulge the details</text>
  <text start="838.64" dur="4.57">the identified participants will make</text>

  <text start="843.21" dur="3.63">publicly begin to position their</text>

  <text start="854.73" dur="5.67">the final report yeah usually if the IG</text>
  <text start="857.16" dur="5.25">adds counter points in the report the IG</text>
  <text start="860.4" dur="3.75">will also note material as to why those</text>
  <text start="862.41" dur="3.9">counter points may or may not hold merit</text>
  <text start="864.15" dur="4.8">and we saw that with the McCabe report</text>
  <text start="866.31" dur="4.17">okay yeah the draft the principal</text>
  <text start="868.95" dur="3.24">responses the counter points and all the</text>
  <text start="870.48" dur="4.02">reference material is then assembled</text>
  <text start="872.19" dur="4.77">into a final report that is submitted to</text>
  <text start="874.5" dur="5.58">the DOJ attorney general and in this</text>
  <text start="876.96" dur="5.79">case likely the FBI director the AG will</text>
  <text start="880.08" dur="4.38">then make the report public depending on</text>

  <text start="884.46" dur="3.72">participating departments a rough</text>
  <text start="885.93" dur="4.41">estimate for final public report would</text>
  <text start="888.18" dur="4.56">be eight weeks plus or minus from the</text>

  <text start="892.74" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;re talking we&amp;#39;re talking September</text>
  <text start="895.86" dur="5.55">right so all of July and all of August</text>
  <text start="898.71" dur="4.32">yeah September dear Lord roughly four</text>
  <text start="901.41" dur="2.76">weeks four draft assembly in reference</text>
  <text start="903.03" dur="2.67">or checks two to four weeks for</text>
  <text start="904.17" dur="2.73">administrative view and another two</text>
  <text start="905.7" dur="3.3">weeks for principal review feedback</text>
  <text start="906.9" dur="3.57">another week or so for the IG</text>
  <text start="909" dur="3.93">counterpoints and additional reference</text>
  <text start="910.47" dur="4.95">citations and then AG we were supposed</text>
  <text start="912.93" dur="4.38">to have this thing in that July June</text>
  <text start="915.42" dur="5.22">really well they were talking as early</text>
  <text start="917.31" dur="4.92">as May May went by June June went by now</text>
  <text start="920.64" dur="3.78">July&amp;#39;s here what we gonna wait another</text>
  <text start="922.23" dur="5.25">eight weeks good lord</text>
  <text start="924.42" dur="4.62">if Ratcliffe is accurate and considering</text>
  <text start="927.48" dur="4.56">we don&amp;#39;t know when the investigative</text>
  <text start="929.04" dur="4.65">phase actually concluded the most likely</text>
  <text start="932.04" dur="2.58">public release date just an estimate</text>
  <text start="933.69" dur="2.43">based on historical</text>
  <text start="934.62" dur="4.73">IG reporting would be the end of August</text>
  <text start="936.12" dur="3.23">or early September Oh</text>
  <text start="939.38" dur="4.99">so if you were interested in the buckets</text>
  <text start="942.81" dur="4.71">of information that needs to be</text>
  <text start="944.37" dur="4.41">declassified that should I mean I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="947.52" dur="2.97">think we&amp;#39;re gonna have to I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="948.78" dur="2.94">it&amp;#39;s gonna take that long but I could be</text>
  <text start="950.49" dur="3.69">wrong</text>
  <text start="951.72" dur="4.35">sounds to me like the way you know</text>
  <text start="954.18" dur="3.45">here&amp;#39;s all the stuff and we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
