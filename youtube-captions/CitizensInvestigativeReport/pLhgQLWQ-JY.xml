  <text start="787.639" dur="3.87">the very first thing says this is faked</text>
  <text start="789.679" dur="5.16">so I went and looked it up</text>
  <text start="791.509" dur="6.93">so the first article I came to was the</text>
  <text start="794.839" dur="6.3">fix is in and we are changed org here it</text>
  <text start="798.439" dur="3.63">is same email and they&amp;#39;re saying in the</text>
  <text start="801.139" dur="2.55">past few days</text>
  <text start="802.069" dur="3.06">numerous tells that they&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="803.689" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re talking about the rigging of the</text>
  <text start="805.129" dur="5.46">election of the election and you can see</text>
  <text start="807.799" dur="5.51">here they&amp;#39;re presenting this as true no</text>
  <text start="810.589" dur="5.04">retraction anywhere no anything at all</text>
  <text start="813.309" dur="4.06">but I do know that we are change was</text>
  <text start="815.629" dur="4.231">heavily focused at that time on like</text>
  <text start="817.369" dur="5.45">election rigging so here it is you know</text>
  <text start="819.86" dur="5.519">if you can&amp;#39;t remember not you know a</text>
  <text start="822.819" dur="4.45">telling exchange clearly mentions the</text>
  <text start="825.379" dur="3.62">present pre setting of the voting</text>
  <text start="827.269" dur="7.13">machines along with the promise that</text>
  <text start="828.999" dur="9.731">they will be humming in November well</text>
  <text start="834.399" dur="9.461">okay so then I look up another one here</text>
  <text start="838.73" dur="8.099">side of media uh Hillary body odor</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="4.8">election rigging and more fake Podesta</text>
  <text start="846.829" dur="5.07">emails expose darker side of media now</text>
  <text start="848.66" dur="5.339">this website is ijr calm don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="851.899" dur="6.03">anything about it but when you go down</text>
  <text start="853.999" dur="7.32">she&amp;#39;s correct it was actually like a</text>
  <text start="857.929" dur="5.1">fake email because there they were okay</text>
  <text start="861.319" dur="4.38">so they were say the claim was it was in</text>
  <text start="863.029" dur="5.28">the WikiLeaks and she&amp;#39;s saying no it</text>
  <text start="865.699" dur="4.68">wasn&amp;#39;t in the WikiLeaks at all so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="868.309" dur="3.661">see a second email and then there was a</text>
  <text start="870.379" dur="4.74">second email saying that Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="871.97" dur="5.099">smelled like boiled boiled cabbage urine</text>
  <text start="875.119" dur="2.731">and farts and rarely bathes and acts</text>
  <text start="877.069" dur="3.45">like a retard</text>
  <text start="877.85" dur="5.31">so okay so these are these are two</text>
  <text start="880.519" dur="4.141">emails Podesta reportedly attributes the</text>
  <text start="883.16" dur="5.429">odor to of the fact that she rarely</text>
  <text start="884.66" dur="6.989">okay and then here here&amp;#39;s from John</text>
  <text start="888.589" dur="8.341">Podesta to somebody and this is a second</text>
  <text start="891.649" dur="6.42">email though Q did not say anything</text>
  <text start="896.93" dur="2.909">about this one</text>
  <text start="898.069" dur="2.671">so between leaked email the fake males</text>
  <text start="899.839" dur="2.581">housing weren&amp;#39;t supposed to get the</text>
  <text start="900.74" dur="3.3">truth is there a way to tell the</text>
  <text start="902.42" dur="3.99">legitimate emails from the fraud simple</text>
  <text start="904.04" dur="5.13">answer is yes on the WikiLeaks page the</text>
  <text start="906.41" dur="4.32">Podesta emails are front and center once</text>
  <text start="909.17" dur="3">inside the Podesta emails how are you</text>
  <text start="910.73" dur="4.2">did okay so I know what they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="912.17" dur="4.32">about and for example a term search</text>
  <text start="914.93" dur="3.779">based on the first email might include</text>
  <text start="916.49" dur="4.649">words such as dogs or loose Soros or</text>
  <text start="918.709" dur="4.74">Mackler the result of that search is</text>
  <text start="921.139" dur="4.56">nothing which I did actually did do it</text>
  <text start="923.449" dur="5.851">and it does come up nothing and again</text>
  <text start="925.699" dur="5.221">for this one so of the four emails one</text>
  <text start="929.3" dur="3.81">was a list of articles that mentions</text>
  <text start="930.92" dur="4.83">Clinton one address a typical Chinese</text>
  <text start="933.11" dur="5.279">diet uh it&amp;#39;s basically saying curried</text>
  <text start="935.75" dur="5.04">cabbage the confusion that such fakes</text>
  <text start="938.389" dur="4.291">have been able to generate ultimately</text>
  <text start="940.79" dur="3.149">due to a very simple conclusion when it</text>
  <text start="942.68" dur="4.019">comes to sifting through any of these</text>
  <text start="943.939" dur="5.25">news reports it&amp;#39;s best to recall Donald</text>
  <text start="946.699" dur="4.771">or Ronald Reagan&amp;#39;s famous words trust</text>
  <text start="949.189" dur="3.811">but verify so she doesn&amp;#39;t really say</text>
  <text start="951.47" dur="2.429">they&amp;#39;re fake but she kind of implies</text>
  <text start="953" dur="3.36">that they&amp;#39;re fake</text>
  <text start="953.899" dur="5.13">so I remember at the time though this</text>
  <text start="956.36" dur="4.68">was count this was pretty much like no</text>
  <text start="959.029" dur="6.721">such town no such company it has been</text>
  <text start="961.04" dur="7.289">proven to be not to be legit and that is</text>
  <text start="965.75" dur="4.589">correct if you look at the actual post</text>
  <text start="968.329" dur="3.81">if you look this guy up</text>
  <text start="970.339" dur="3.901">Todd McClure you&amp;#39;re not gonna find</text>
