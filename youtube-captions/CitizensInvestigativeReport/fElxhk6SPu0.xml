  <text start="523.909" dur="5.16">I saw them but I think history is going</text>
  <text start="526.85" dur="4.65">to be much kinder to Jim Comey in that</text>
  <text start="529.069" dur="4.621">July press conference than the Democrats</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="4.05">were when he had it I think he had</text>
  <text start="533.69" dur="3.36">access to information so all your</text>
  <text start="535.55" dur="4.019">viewers see is this meeting on the</text>

  <text start="539.569" dur="3.991">additional information that I am</text>
  <text start="541.61" dur="3.959">convinced left him with no other choice</text>
  <text start="543.56" dur="3.899">then make the decision he made in July</text>
  <text start="545.569" dur="4.351">so you&amp;#39;re saying he&amp;#39;s got no choice</text>
  <text start="547.459" dur="3.901">there was pressure on him to not in</text>
  <text start="549.92" dur="3.539">prosecute Hillary Clinton is that what</text>
  <text start="551.36" dur="4.74">you&amp;#39;re suggesting no I think he had</text>
  <text start="553.459" dur="4.531">access to information he had access to</text>
  <text start="556.1" dur="4.549">information that your viewers don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="557.99" dur="5.61">and they may not ever have because it is</text>
  <text start="560.649" dur="5.5">fine but trust me when I tell you this</text>
  <text start="563.6" dur="5.13">Martha I know what it was and I had been</text>
  <text start="566.149" dur="4.29">a critic of Jim Comey in the past but he</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="3.78">made the only decision he could have</text>
  <text start="570.439" dur="3.221">made with respect to appropriating that</text>
  <text start="572.51" dur="3.1">decision away from the</text>
  <text start="573.66" dur="4.2">Department of Justice and making the</text>
  <text start="575.61" dur="3.84">decision himself and history will be a</text>
  <text start="577.86" dur="4.23">hell of a lot kinder to him than the</text>
  <text start="579.45" dur="4.17">Democrats were at the time III</text>
  <text start="582.09" dur="2.52">I only take away from that that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="3">suggesting that there were more</text>
  <text start="584.61" dur="3.51">entanglement between the Clintons and</text>
  <text start="586.62" dur="3.96">perhaps the Justice Department than</text>
  <text start="588.12" dur="5.25">everyone understands you&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="590.58" dur="4.11">perceptive I only played little excerpts</text>
  <text start="593.37" dur="3.03">of it because some of the things he says</text>
  <text start="594.69" dur="5.64">just gets right underneath my nails and</text>
  <text start="596.4" dur="5.88">I can&amp;#39;t take it because you know how</text>
  <text start="600.33" dur="4.71">much did these guys know going forward I</text>
  <text start="602.28" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t know but sometimes trey Gowdy some</text>
