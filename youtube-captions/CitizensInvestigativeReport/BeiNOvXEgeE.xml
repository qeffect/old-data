  <text start="118.2" dur="3.14">for you about that</text>
  <text start="122.96" dur="4.71">Washington Justice Department with an</text>
  <text start="125.27" dur="4.53">issue of a memo a moment ago in support</text>
  <text start="127.67" dur="4.5">of Matthew Whitaker to be the acting</text>
  <text start="129.8" dur="5.07">Attorney General is the opinion issued</text>

  <text start="134.87" dur="4.32">to appoint Whitaker acting AG that</text>
  <text start="137.18" dur="4.65">points to the federal vacancies Reform</text>
  <text start="139.19" dur="4.32">Act of 1998 saying that the do J&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.83" dur="3.239">office of legal counsel had advised</text>
  <text start="143.51" dur="4.05">President Trump that he could appoint a</text>
  <text start="145.069" dur="4.471">senior DOJ officials such as mr.</text>

  <text start="153.29" dur="3.87">Sandra to the case that Mercedes schlopp</text>
  <text start="155.36" dur="3.57">was making on our network just yes</text>
  <text start="157.16" dur="4.049">really interesting the way they lay this</text>
  <text start="158.93" dur="5.13">all out the opening line of the opinion</text>
  <text start="161.209" dur="5.25">of the office of the legal counsel says</text>
  <text start="164.06" dur="4.709">the President appointed Whitaker under</text>
  <text start="166.459" dur="4.801">the federal vacancies Reform Act of 1998</text>
  <text start="168.769" dur="4.591">and further reveals and this is the</text>
  <text start="171.26" dur="4.199">quote this office previously had advised</text>
  <text start="173.36" dur="4.379">the president could designate a senior</text>
  <text start="175.459" dur="4.741">Department of Justice officials such as</text>
  <text start="177.739" dur="4.921">mr. Whitaker as a acting Attorney</text>
  <text start="180.2" dur="4.98">General under the plain terms of the</text>
  <text start="182.66" dur="3.78">vacancy Reform Act he had been serving</text>
  <text start="185.18" dur="3.029">in the Department of Justice said is</text>
  <text start="186.44" dur="4.32">sufficiently senior pay level for over a</text>
  <text start="188.209" dur="5.971">year it goes on to very clearly lay out</text>
  <text start="190.76" dur="5.43">its case and one important factor that</text>
  <text start="194.18" dur="3.36">when looking at this the office of legal</text>
  <text start="196.19" dur="4.5">counsel had to go all the way back to</text>
  <text start="197.54" dur="5.61">1866 to find another instance where a</text>
  <text start="200.69" dur="5.16">non senate-confirmed individual sat as</text>
  <text start="203.15" dur="4.35">Acting attorney like there&amp;#39;s this phrase</text>
  <text start="205.85" dur="3.21">principal officer that&amp;#39;s been coming up</text>
  <text start="207.5" dur="3.03">in these legal arguments and essentially</text>
  <text start="209.06" dur="4.08">with it what the lawyers will argue is</text>
  <text start="210.53" dur="4.95">is whether they support that under his</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="4.14">political history or not this is what</text>
  <text start="215.48" dur="4.17">they argue although the Attorney General</text>
  <text start="217.28" dur="4.5">is a principal officer it does not</text>
  <text start="219.65" dur="3.72">follow that an acting Attorney General</text>
  <text start="221.78" dur="3.66">should be understood to be one so</text>
  <text start="223.37" dur="4.32">therein lies your argument this debate</text>
  <text start="225.44" dur="3.75">we had yesterday Sandra with Michael</text>
  <text start="227.69" dur="4.079">McKay&amp;#39;s the former attorney general on</text>
  <text start="229.19" dur="4.019">one side of this argument and Andy</text>
  <text start="231.769" dur="2.821">McCarthy and others on the other side</text>
  <text start="233.209" dur="3.421">throughout our broadcast yesterday so</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="5.61">interesting legal discussion on that</text>
  <text start="236.63" dur="5.97">certainly so apparently the Department</text>
  <text start="240.2" dur="4.34">of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issue</text>
  <text start="242.6" dur="4.199">it&amp;#39;s a pending opinion this morning</text>
  <text start="244.54" dur="3.64">supporting president Trump&amp;#39;s appointment</text>
  <text start="246.799" dur="3.03">of Matthew Whitaker as acting Attorney</text>
  <text start="248.18" dur="2.85">General despite criticisms from</text>
  <text start="249.829" dur="3.66">Democrats who have questioned his</text>
  <text start="251.03" dur="4.769">qualifications to oversee the Russia</text>
  <text start="253.489" dur="3.22">investigation oh my god these they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="255.799" dur="2.891">ever stop</text>
  <text start="256.709" dur="4.441">in its opinion the office of legal</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="4.039">counsel said that the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.15" dur="4.65">appointment of Whittaker to replace</text>
  <text start="262.729" dur="7.06">sessions was consistent with the vacancy</text>
  <text start="265.8" dur="5.22">Reform Act of 1998 the office previously</text>
  <text start="269.789" dur="3.361">had advised the president could</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="4.32">designate a senior department of the of</text>
  <text start="273.15" dur="5.91">Justice officials such as mr. Whittaker</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="5.34">as Acting Attorney General and they said</text>
  <text start="279.06" dur="3">noting that Whittaker had been serving</text>
  <text start="280.68" dur="4.32">at the Department of Justice at a</text>
  <text start="282.06" dur="4.919">sufficiently senior pay level for over a</text>
  <text start="285" dur="5.16">year yeah I got to be over a gs-15 which</text>
  <text start="286.979" dur="5.131">he is so there you go so far they were</text>
  <text start="290.16" dur="3.42">you know this will go to court to</text>
  <text start="292.11" dur="2.88">because you know there&amp;#39;s lawsuits oh</text>
  <text start="293.58" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re so litigious it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="294.99" dur="6.75">ridiculous but anyway so we support him</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="6.78">I support him I think it&amp;#39;s a good idea</text>
  <text start="301.74" dur="5.04">and he hasn&amp;#39;t done anything - like</text>
  <text start="305.16" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s no proof that he&amp;#39;s gonna like</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="4.229">mess with the Muller investigation give</text>
  <text start="308.61" dur="3.869">me a break you know do they have any</text>
  <text start="311.009" dur="3.991">proof of it just things that he said</text>
  <text start="312.479" dur="4.831">when he was a private citizen and when</text>
  <text start="315" dur="4.44">you&amp;#39;re a private citizen you can say</text>
  <text start="317.31" dur="4.65">those things you can&amp;#39;t say him in office</text>
  <text start="319.44" dur="5.64">but you can say although they do don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="321.96" dur="5.79">think all right moving on to an article</text>
  <text start="325.08" dur="5.91">today by Zero Hedge feds investigating</text>
