  <text start="37.98" dur="3.72">the hill right right and in fact you and</text>
  <text start="40.079" dur="3.48">I were discussing a couple of days ago I</text>
  <text start="41.7" dur="6.199">guess that your viewer that the the fara</text>
  <text start="43.559" dur="7.471">the foreign agent Registration Act is</text>
  <text start="47.899" dur="5.291">unconstitutional is it well until Muller</text>
  <text start="51.03" dur="5.099">came along it had been enforced only</text>
  <text start="53.19" dur="5.13">civilly and of course remember that it</text>
  <text start="56.129" dur="4.68">was charged against Manta Ford and I</text>
  <text start="58.32" dur="4.649">think one of the Podesta brothers was</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="4.621">named in the indictment he either got</text>
  <text start="62.969" dur="4.021">immunity or nothing happened to him but</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="3.54">then look what happened to manna fort</text>
  <text start="66.99" dur="6.15">right and then at the last minute right</text>
  <text start="68.97" dur="5.55">before general Flynn was to enter his go</text>
  <text start="73.14" dur="4.47">to his sentencing in front of Judge</text>

  <text start="82.74" dur="4.47">another one I looked at well actually</text>
  <text start="85.259" dur="3.811">not until I got into the case with</text>
  <text start="87.21" dur="3.42">general Flynn but I saw what they were</text>
  <text start="89.07" dur="5.49">trying to do and it made no sense</text>
  <text start="90.63" dur="5.91">whatsoever that brings up a whole nother</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="4.47">issue is this is this unequal</text>
  <text start="96.54" dur="4.56">application of the law you know which</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="5.43">which again it goes to this Banana</text>
  <text start="101.1" dur="6.229">Republic sort of template that we seem</text>
  <text start="104.46" dur="8.089">to be following now in our country which</text>
  <text start="107.329" dur="9.04">to my mind it shock it&amp;#39;s shocking and</text>
  <text start="112.549" dur="6.64">just very depressing I mean to think</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="5.131">that you know in our country you are</text>
  <text start="119.189" dur="4.831">prosecuted based on what political party</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="5.219">you belong to or what act like political</text>
  <text start="124.02" dur="5.75">philosophy you adhere to who you</text>
  <text start="126.719" dur="7.141">associate with you know potentially or</text>
  <text start="129.77" dur="6.31">if you happen to be in the way of simple</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="3.84">Genda that&amp;#39;s you know like in the case</text>
  <text start="136.08" dur="4.53">of all those Arthur Anderson employees</text>
  <text start="137.7" dur="4.65">you just happened to be in a job that in</text>
  <text start="140.61" dur="3.12">which your company suddenly becomes the</text>
  <text start="142.35" dur="6.2">target of the government for whatever</text>
  <text start="143.73" dur="8.01">reason now I what do you think this</text>
  <text start="148.55" dur="5.53">mister Fijians dismissal his dismissal</text>
  <text start="151.74" dur="4.34">of his case portends for general Flynn&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.08" dur="4.98">case I yeah we think it&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="156.08" dur="5.14">it&amp;#39;s good omen for you yes well part of</text>
  <text start="159.06" dur="5.34">the statement of the offense that he</text>
  <text start="161.22" dur="4.83">pled guilty to includes an allegation</text>
  <text start="164.4" dur="4.65">that there were material false</text>
  <text start="166.05" dur="4.44">statements in the faroe filing it blew</text>
  <text start="169.05" dur="3.96">up in the Eastern District of Virginia</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="5.34">when they when the prosecutors there</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="6.09">including mr. van gock who was still</text>
  <text start="175.83" dur="6.39">prosecuting mr. Flinn now was determined</text>
  <text start="179.1" dur="5.82">that mr. Flinn testify that he knowingly</text>
  <text start="182.22" dur="5.76">and intentionally signed a false fair</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="5.1">registration well he didn&amp;#39;t and the</text>
  <text start="187.98" dur="5.04">statement of offense doesn&amp;#39;t say that in</text>
  <text start="190.02" dur="4.77">fact I just recently found the draft of</text>
  <text start="193.02" dur="4.5">the statement of offense that shows that</text>
  <text start="194.79" dur="4.65">that language was taken out so mr. van</text>
  <text start="197.52" dur="4.11">Gregg and I got into a heated exchange</text>
  <text start="199.44" dur="5.43">he was on the speakerphone and I was</text>
  <text start="201.63" dur="5.4">with like six assistant US Attorney&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="4.47">Eastern District of Virginia in which I</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="5">explained to him that general Flynn was</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="6.48">not going to lie and to say that and he</text>
  <text start="212.03" dur="5.739">said be careful what you at what you say</text>
  <text start="215.82" dur="5.31">you don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s on this phone call</text>
  <text start="217.769" dur="5.701">and I said put the world on the phone</text>
  <text start="221.13" dur="5.79">mr. fan Gregg just but the worldand</text>
  <text start="223.47" dur="5.76">right good good for you and and that</text>
  <text start="226.92" dur="4.83">you&amp;#39;re not the type to back at the fact</text>
  <text start="229.23" dur="5.19">that or to be intimidated yeah and then</text>
  <text start="231.75" dur="5.66">I wound up filing in judge tringa and</text>
  <text start="234.42" dur="5.34">judge Sullivan&amp;#39;s court I essentially a</text>
  <text start="237.41" dur="4.87">transcript or at least the notes that</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="6.509">had been taken by our note taker of that</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="6.33">meeting and that whole exchange because</text>
  <text start="246.269" dur="3.271">the judges needed to know exactly what</text>
  <text start="248.61" dur="1.69">was going on</text>
  <text start="249.54" dur="4.99">Wow</text>
  <text start="250.3" dur="6.27">that&amp;#39;s great so I I think that general</text>
  <text start="254.53" dur="3.72">Flynn is probably pretty confident now</text>
  <text start="256.57" dur="3.63">that you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re representing him that</text>
  <text start="258.25" dur="3.87">the future looks brighter</text>
  <text start="260.2" dur="4.41">he feels much better I mean I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="262.12" dur="4.83">identified significant Brady violations</text>
  <text start="264.61" dur="4.8">in the case not the least of which is a</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="4.41">January 30th internal memorandum and</text>
  <text start="269.41" dur="3.72">Department of Justice that clears him of</text>
  <text start="271.36" dur="4.17">being quote an agent of Russia</text>
  <text start="273.13" dur="4.89">end quote which is apparently the first</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="5.1">thing they pre textually investigated</text>
  <text start="278.02" dur="5.43">him for even though he was working with</text>
  <text start="280.63" dur="4.89">the DIA on all his foreign contacts</text>
  <text start="283.45" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;ve suppressed that information from</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="5.7">us there are substantial reports but a</text>
  <text start="288.55" dur="5.19">number of DIA officers about his</text>
  <text start="291.22" dur="4.47">briefings and debriefings and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.74" dur="5.04">classified so they&amp;#39;ve denied me a</text>
  <text start="295.69" dur="4.95">security clearance and any access to</text>
  <text start="298.78" dur="5.76">that information I&amp;#39;m like the last</text>
  <text start="300.64" dur="5.94">person in the world ever I know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.54" dur="4.23">really going on right right well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.58" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re using all the the</text>
  <text start="308.77" dur="2.55">tools at their disposal and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="310.18" dur="2.82">wholly how many of you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.32" dur="3.72">holding all the lot of the cards oh not</text>
  <text start="313" dur="4.17">all of them but but they certainly have</text>
  <text start="315.04" dur="4.2">advantages that you know as the</text>
  <text start="317.17" dur="3.45">government with control over the</text>
  <text start="319.24" dur="4.02">issuance of security clearances and</text>
  <text start="320.62" dur="4.77">everything else to make your your job</text>
  <text start="323.26" dur="4.62">that much more much more difficult but</text>
  <text start="325.39" dur="5.37">what really infuriates me is they are</text>
  <text start="327.88" dur="4.95">hiding the truth absolutely i we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="330.76" dur="4.44">solve any problem in this country until</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="3.42">we know what the actual problem is and</text>
  <text start="335.2" dur="3.57">what the truth is</text>
  <text start="336.25" dur="3.54">right is an objective truth there well</text>
  <text start="338.77" dur="3.3">your it seems to me you&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="339.79" dur="4.59">fortunate to have Joe Sullivan on the</text>
  <text start="342.07" dur="6.12">case any heyguys ktg citizens</text>

  <text start="376.87" dur="4.95">investigations by Durham are so</text>
  <text start="379.21" dur="4.95">important there&amp;#39;s a reason why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="381.82" dur="4.05">doing that all right so</text>
  <text start="384.16" dur="3.48">you saw that you saw the little</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="4.5">interview there from yesterday with uh</text>
  <text start="387.64" dur="4.2">Sidney Powell and judicial watch so that</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="6.72">gives you a little idea of what she&amp;#39;s</text>
