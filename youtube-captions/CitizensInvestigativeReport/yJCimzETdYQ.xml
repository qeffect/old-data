  <text start="1111.68" dur="5.82">bring you a message of hope not fear a</text>
  <text start="1114.37" dur="9.64">message that I hope will galvanize us</text>
  <text start="1117.5" dur="11.6">all into much-needed action the problem</text>
  <text start="1124.01" dur="9.39">is quite simple anarchy and chaos</text>
  <text start="1129.1" dur="8.26">prevalence in Washington DC because the</text>
  <text start="1133.4" dur="6.9">federal government has seized powers to</text>
  <text start="1137.36" dur="7.77">which it is not entitled to and is</text>
  <text start="1140.3" dur="8.31">passing masses of laws that are 100</text>
  <text start="1145.13" dur="7.8">percent unconstitutional and when you</text>

  <text start="1159.49" dur="8.95">tyranny now I&amp;#39;m paranoid I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="1165.05" dur="5.55">admit to you right up front but let me</text>
  <text start="1168.44" dur="8.28">tell you what the real meaning of the</text>
  <text start="1170.6" dur="11.49">word paranoid is it is a man or a person</text>
  <text start="1176.72" dur="8.79">who has the ability to link events that</text>
  <text start="1182.09" dur="5.76">seemingly are not connected that is the</text>
  <text start="1185.51" dur="3.15">true meaning of paranoid or being</text>
  <text start="1187.85" dur="3.3">paranoid</text>
  <text start="1188.66" dur="5.31">of course it been used by our enemies</text>
  <text start="1191.15" dur="4.83">the Socialists the Marxist the dubrow&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1193.97" dur="6.209">the so-called</text>
  <text start="1195.98" dur="5.85">aggressives to smear us how many times</text>
  <text start="1200.179" dur="3.961">haven&amp;#39;t I heard it said of me that</text>
  <text start="1201.83" dur="5.69">fellow&amp;#39;s paranoid yes I&amp;#39;m glad to admit</text>
  <text start="1204.14" dur="6.21">it because I have the ability to connect</text>
  <text start="1207.52" dur="6.34">events that are seemingly unconnected</text>
  <text start="1210.35" dur="10.62">and when you do that you begin to arrive</text>
  <text start="1213.86" dur="9.059">at the truth it&amp;#39;s taken me 25 years to</text>
  <text start="1220.97" dur="5.579">come to the conclusion that I have come</text>
  <text start="1222.919" dur="6.061">too and I want to tell you that one of</text>
  <text start="1226.549" dur="3.841">the biggest things I discovered in my</text>
  <text start="1228.98" dur="4.5">work was the existence of a</text>
  <text start="1230.39" dur="7.32">supranational committee composed of</text>
  <text start="1233.48" dur="6.27">three hundred men I came across as quite</text>
  <text start="1237.71" dur="4.86">by accident when I was serving in Africa</text>
  <text start="1239.75" dur="6">in Angola and I was given a series of</text>
  <text start="1242.57" dur="5.67">documents which were only supposed to be</text>
  <text start="1245.75" dur="6.9">handed in to top-level people they were</text>
  <text start="1248.24" dur="7.35">what we call about the top level of</text>
  <text start="1252.65" dur="5.46">classification of intelligence documents</text>
  <text start="1255.59" dur="5.07">and there I discovered that what I</text>
  <text start="1258.11" dur="6.39">thought I was in Africa fighting against</text>
  <text start="1260.66" dur="7.41">the invasion of the Communists I was in</text>
  <text start="1264.5" dur="6.45">fact fighting to introduce socialist</text>
  <text start="1268.07" dur="6.09">regimes in the black African countries</text>
  <text start="1270.95" dur="4.77">and that I was actually working for a</text>
  <text start="1274.16" dur="4.23">committee called the committee of 300</text>
  <text start="1275.72" dur="6.15">also known in intelligence circles as</text>

  <text start="1281.87" dur="4.35">I want to digress for a moment and tell</text>
  <text start="1283.76" dur="4.38">you the word intelligence has been</text>
  <text start="1286.22" dur="3.54">bandied around a great deal in the</text>

  <text start="2911.96" dur="3.24">incoming presidential administration</text>
