  <text start="424.15" dur="4.17">like well that&amp;#39;s not true well that was</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="3.9">not for a legitimate purpose well this</text>
  <text start="428.32" dur="5.34">is they did not like for example the FBI</text>
  <text start="430.51" dur="5.19">and the DOJ officials did not abuse oh</text>
  <text start="433.66" dur="6.54">okay well we&amp;#39;re gonna take that because</text>
  <text start="435.7" dur="6.72">you know um because you said so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.2" dur="3">no proof in it so Nunez came out with a</text>
  <text start="442.42" dur="2.37">statement and said the House</text>
  <text start="443.2" dur="3.33">Intelligence Committee chairman Devin</text>
  <text start="444.79" dur="3.69">Nunez issued the following statement</text>
  <text start="446.53" dur="4.5">today on the release of the committee&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="448.48" dur="5.4">minority memo quote the American people</text>
  <text start="451.03" dur="5.28">now clearly understand that the FBI used</text>
  <text start="453.88" dur="4.74">political dirt paid for by the</text>
  <text start="456.31" dur="4.58">Democratic Party to spy on an American</text>
  <text start="458.62" dur="5.13">citizen from the Republican Party</text>
  <text start="460.89" dur="5.74">furthermore the FISA Court was misled</text>
  <text start="463.75" dur="4.83">about mr. pages past interactions with</text>
  <text start="466.63" dur="4.11">the FBI in which he helped build a case</text>
  <text start="468.58" dur="2.85">against a rush against Russian</text>
  <text start="470.74" dur="3.15">operatives</text>
  <text start="471.43" dur="4.53">in America who were brought to justice</text>
  <text start="473.89" dur="3.63">it defies belief</text>
  <text start="475.96" dur="5.34">that the Department of Justice and the</text>
  <text start="477.52" dur="6.48">FBI failed to provide information to a</text>
  <text start="481.3" dur="5.82">secret court that they had provided to</text>
  <text start="484" dur="6.21">an open federal court regarding their</text>
  <text start="487.12" dur="5.07">past interactions with mr. page and then</text>
  <text start="490.21" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s and then I&amp;#39;ll put this link in the</text>
  <text start="492.19" dur="3.81">description it&amp;#39;s got the four it&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="494.14" dur="3.45">the counterpoint counterpoint</text>

  <text start="498.85" dur="9.48">documents you need from right here okay</text>
  <text start="500.77" dur="9.27">all right so this is the key points and</text>
  <text start="508.33" dur="3.99">I&amp;#39;ll put this in the description but</text>
  <text start="510.04" dur="5.28">they just don&amp;#39;t for instance it says the</text>
  <text start="512.32" dur="6.3">Democratic memo represents a lengthy but</text>
  <text start="515.32" dur="5.13">wholly unpersuasive attempt to distract</text>
  <text start="518.62" dur="4.35">from the committee&amp;#39;s key findings on</text>
  <text start="520.45" dur="4.17">FISA abuse which were confirmed by</text>
  <text start="522.97" dur="3.9">Senator Grassley and Graham&amp;#39;s criminal</text>
  <text start="524.62" dur="5.64">referral to the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="526.87" dur="5.51">the Democratic memo and I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="530.26" dur="4.53">reading this for a lot of my viewers who</text>
