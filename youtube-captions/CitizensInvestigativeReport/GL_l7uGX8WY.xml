  <text start="183.03" dur="4.74">to attend hearings depositions and</text>
  <text start="185.04" dur="4.95">interviews these are basic standards</text>
  <text start="187.77" dur="4.26">that every American should expect</text>
  <text start="189.99" dur="4.83">including the President of the United</text>

  <text start="194.82" dur="4.62">of an angry mob a willing media machine</text>
  <text start="196.98" dur="4.8">and a twisted version of an impeachment</text>
  <text start="199.44" dur="4.14">process that didn&amp;#39;t begin two months ago</text>
  <text start="201.78" dur="3.9">that began day one of this</text>
  <text start="203.58" dur="4.31">administration it is a sham and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="205.68" dur="6.17">time for it to end</text>

  <text start="216.63" dur="4.65">you something you should be outraged if</text>
  <text start="219.39" dur="4.02">you&amp;#39;re an American at what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="221.28" dur="4.83">here you should be allowed to confront</text>
  <text start="223.41" dur="5.52">your accusers this is being held behind</text>
  <text start="226.11" dur="4.92">closed doors for a reason because they</text>
  <text start="228.93" dur="3.27">don&amp;#39;t want you to see what the witnesses</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="3.54">are like let me give you an example</text>
  <text start="232.2" dur="4.41">recently we had the Muller mr. Muller</text>
  <text start="234.57" dur="4.41">came in to give a report in judiciary</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="4.56">you were there you saw the American</text>
  <text start="238.98" dur="4.5">people saw it you know why mr. molars</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="4.08">report fell apart and why we knew that</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="4.02">there was nothing there because we got</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="4.739">to observe mr. Muller himself testify</text>
  <text start="247.5" dur="5.28">because when he was asked questions you</text>
  <text start="249.989" dur="4.381">could see he didn&amp;#39;t understand what had</text>
  <text start="252.78" dur="4.829">happened in his own investigation you</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="6.48">saw him flipping through pages you get</text>
  <text start="257.609" dur="5.461">to see who is accusing you when you</text>
  <text start="260.85" dur="4.65">denied that you might as well be living</text>
  <text start="263.07" dur="4.04">in the former Soviet Union this is a</text>
  <text start="265.5" dur="4.8">Soviet style</text>
  <text start="267.11" dur="5.8">impeachment process this is closed doors</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="4.35">it is unfair in every way and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="4.83">care whether you are the President of</text>
  <text start="274.65" dur="4.68">the United States or any other citizens</text>
  <text start="277.74" dur="4.79">of this country you should be allowed to</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="7.02">confront your witnesses absent that</text>
  <text start="282.53" dur="5.02">absent that you get nothing but tyranny</text>
  <text start="286.35" dur="2.76">and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on with mr.</text>
  <text start="287.55" dur="3.57">Schiff we&amp;#39;re gonna go in there today and</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="5.97">demand we get our rights as members of</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="10.08">Congress and with that Zeldin mr. billet</text>

  <text start="325.17" dur="6.06">happening behind closed doors is</text>
  <text start="327.59" dur="5.14">unclassified there&amp;#39;s no reason why the</text>
  <text start="331.23" dur="4.83">American public shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="332.73" dur="6.6">watch this in real-time live this is a</text>
  <text start="336.06" dur="6.42">process lacking legitimacy credibility</text>
  <text start="339.33" dur="5.97">and fairness and we have a huge problem</text>
  <text start="342.48" dur="4.74">with that one fun fact from yesterday I</text>
  <text start="345.3" dur="3.69">saw that the opening statement leaked</text>
