  <text start="127.74" dur="4.77">two Ford&amp;#39;s accusations added this is</text>
  <text start="130.2" dur="3.6">shameful and it&amp;#39;s the height of response</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="3.54">and responsibility</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re so like the projection is so</text>

  <text start="156.14" dur="5.79">this is getting like into the you know</text>
  <text start="158.88" dur="5.73">into the Wild West here okay</text>
  <text start="161.93" dur="4.39">Ford first brought her allegations to</text>
  <text start="164.61" dur="4.98">the attention of Dianne Feinstein in</text>
  <text start="166.32" dur="5.58">July but Feinstein didn&amp;#39;t disclose the</text>
  <text start="169.59" dur="4.38">allegations to her Senate colleagues or</text>
  <text start="171.9" dur="3.78">federal authorities until days before</text>

  <text start="179.91" dur="3.87">office of compromising forts anonymity</text>
  <text start="181.92" dur="4.5">by sitting on the allegations until she</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="6">could deploy them for maximum political</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="5.52">gain and then here&amp;#39;s and then in the</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="5.06">article that I&amp;#39;ll include in the note in</text>
  <text start="191.94" dur="6.63">the show notes senator Hatch&amp;#39;s tweet</text>
  <text start="194.84" dur="5.83">which I thought was just like sweet some</text>
  <text start="198.57" dur="4.52">might find it exceedingly difficult to</text>
  <text start="200.67" dur="4.2">imagine Judiciary Committee Democrats</text>
  <text start="203.09" dur="4.81">expressing this complaint with a</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="5.06">straight face I mean it&amp;#39;s true that they</text>
  <text start="207.9" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t care they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="209.93" dur="3.79">they&amp;#39;re evil</text>
  <text start="211.65" dur="4.23">like like President Trump said yesterday</text>
  <text start="213.72" dur="5.87">they&amp;#39;re pure evil it&amp;#39;s just pure evil</text>
  <text start="215.88" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;re fighting so 10 a.m. this morning</text>
  <text start="219.59" dur="5.92">is supposed to be the hearing I will be</text>
  <text start="222.72" dur="4.83">I am wondering if she&amp;#39;s even gonna go</text>
  <text start="225.51" dur="3.51">through with it you guys I&amp;#39;m sure she at</text>
  <text start="227.55" dur="3.15">this point I would think we would have</text>
  <text start="229.02" dur="6.36">news that she wasn&amp;#39;t gonna go through</text>
  <text start="230.7" dur="6.6">with it but like come on you know it</text>
  <text start="235.38" dur="4.079">says the hearing which in which for days</text>
  <text start="237.3" dur="3.05">had been in doubt will be a public</text>
  <text start="239.459" dur="2.821">chance</text>
  <text start="240.35" dur="4.57">excuse me will be a chance for the</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="4.35">public to see Ford in person explain in</text>
  <text start="244.92" dur="4.11">detail what she claims happen at the</text>
  <text start="246.63" dur="4.26">Maryland house party in 1982 where</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="4.02">Cavanaugh allegedly jumped on top of her</text>
  <text start="250.89" dur="3.69">and tried to muffle her screams and why</text>
  <text start="253.05" dur="4.77">she didn&amp;#39;t tell anyone about the episode</text>
  <text start="254.58" dur="5.37">until 2012 and I&amp;#39;m real curious to know</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="4.86">like if she actually named Kavanaugh in</text>
  <text start="259.95" dur="5.31">2012 what did she the they don&amp;#39;t release</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="4.83">those records of course you know and</text>
  <text start="265.26" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s if you have a weak stomach for the</text>
  <text start="267.51" dur="3.51">kind of stuff yeah I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="3.54">watch the hearings because it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="4.59">gonna be nothing but a show sorry</text>
  <text start="272.82" dur="5.72">but that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s gonna be basically</text>
  <text start="275.61" dur="5.49">the Judiciary Committee chuck Grassley</text>
  <text start="278.54" dur="4.36">from Iowa and the ranking committee</text>
  <text start="281.1" dur="3.78">member Feinstein will have opening</text>
  <text start="282.9" dur="5.61">statements and after they deliver Ford</text>

  <text start="288.51" dur="3.75">know provide her public statement which</text>
  <text start="290.31" dur="3.21">has already been released and then each</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="3">senator on the committee will be</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="3.87">afforded a single five minute round of</text>
  <text start="295.26" dur="4.23">questions with the opportunity to ask</text>
  <text start="297.39" dur="3.78">questions alternating between Democrats</text>
  <text start="299.49" dur="6.03">and Republicans and Republicans have</text>
  <text start="301.17" dur="7.32">retained Rachel Mitchell an experienced</text>
  <text start="305.52" dur="5.46">sex crimes prosecutor I wish that she</text>
  <text start="308.49" dur="4.17">was a defender but okay to handle some</text>
  <text start="310.98" dur="4.38">of their questioning saying it will help</text>
  <text start="312.66" dur="4.59">avoid an overtly political atmosphere</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="4.44">right because then it&amp;#39;ll be like aw look</text>

  <text start="1052.8" dur="3.6">this is what they do they did they they</text>
  <text start="1054.809" dur="3.87">tried to do this with Gorsuch but it</text>

  <text start="1079.41" dur="5.85">plenty and Republicans to blame here for</text>
  <text start="1082.98" dur="4.47">what&amp;#39;s going on so I&amp;#39;m not by any means</text>
  <text start="1085.26" dur="6.06">like you know touting the Republican</text>

  <text start="1098.16" dur="7.86">when President Obama I hate to even call</text>
  <text start="1102.03" dur="8.75">him that Hussein when he we had we had</text>
  <text start="1106.02" dur="8.58">Sotomayor and Kagan and they were passed</text>
  <text start="1110.78" dur="6.01">mostly I mean we didn&amp;#39;t do this we could</text>
  <text start="1114.6" dur="4.02">have done this stretch that out and ask</text>
  <text start="1116.79" dur="4.71">for FBI investigations and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1118.62" dur="5.64">the next thing but we didn&amp;#39;t do it you</text>
  <text start="1121.5" dur="4.62">know so it&amp;#39;s just they&amp;#39;re disgusting</text>
  <text start="1124.26" dur="4.65">okay so anyway let&amp;#39;s leave that topic</text>
  <text start="1126.12" dur="5.189">for now go back to the rot Rosenstein so</text>
  <text start="1128.91" dur="10.95">there was an article in conservative</text>
  <text start="1131.309" dur="10.62">treehouse yesterday morning and it was</text>
  <text start="1139.86" dur="4.319">about Rosenstein versus mccabe and how</text>
  <text start="1141.929" dur="4.651">the two there were two camps warring</text>
  <text start="1144.179" dur="6.181">inside you know of this whole</text>
  <text start="1146.58" dur="5.4">mess with invest with the Russia team</text>
  <text start="1150.36" dur="4.02">Rosenstein and team McCabe team</text>
  <text start="1151.98" dur="5.07">Rosenstein consisted of current</text>
  <text start="1154.38" dur="5.49">officials jeff sessions dana buente and</text>
  <text start="1157.05" dur="5.79">team mccabe has former officials Lisa</text>

  <text start="1162.84" dur="5.58">remember Lisa Paige and James Baker you</text>
  <text start="1165.6" dur="4.53">know they&amp;#39;re turning I and we don&amp;#39;t hear</text>
  <text start="1168.42" dur="4.23">much about Mike Court and he probably is</text>
  <text start="1170.13" dur="4.14">too so you got to put this all in</text>
  <text start="1172.65" dur="4.11">perspective each camp has a media outlet</text>
  <text start="1174.27" dur="4.8">to push their narrative team Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="1176.76" dur="4.32">has the washington post team mccabe is</text>

  <text start="1187.08" dur="4.59">understand this and the reporting</text>
  <text start="1188.82" dur="5.37">narrative context make context makes</text>
  <text start="1191.67" dur="4.26">more sense both Andrew McCabe and rod</text>
  <text start="1194.19" dur="4.05">Rosenstein took corrupt and and legal</text>
  <text start="1195.93" dur="3.78">action to try to take down the president</text>
  <text start="1198.24" dur="2.91">in the United States however generally</text>
  <text start="1199.71" dur="4.05">speaking McCabe&amp;#39;s actions were</text>
  <text start="1201.15" dur="5.13">specifically intended to facilitate a</text>
  <text start="1203.76" dur="5.07">soft cue whereas Rosen&amp;#39;s scene was more</text>
  <text start="1206.28" dur="4.98">of a willing ly facilitating useful</text>
  <text start="1208.83" dur="3.72">idiot in the grand scheme um this is</text>
  <text start="1211.26" dur="3.36">just a theory that they have and they</text>
  <text start="1212.55" dur="5.79">give examples you know of who did what</text>
  <text start="1214.62" dur="7.5">and it&amp;#39;s a good article I&amp;#39;m gonna put it</text>
  <text start="1218.34" dur="5.88">in the show notes but basically I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1222.12" dur="4.4">going to play a little clip from damp on</text>
  <text start="1224.22" dur="5.28">jeana&amp;#39;s podcast from yesterday cuz he</text>
  <text start="1226.52" dur="5.95">has a beautiful way of putting these</text>
  <text start="1229.5" dur="5.76">things in perspective because he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1232.47" dur="5.79">involved with investigations you know so</text>
  <text start="1235.26" dur="4.92">as a Secret Service guy and so let me</text>
  <text start="1238.26" dur="4.17">play this clip and it sums it up</text>
  <text start="1240.18" dur="4.8">perfectly there&amp;#39;s you know something</text>
  <text start="1242.43" dur="5.31">that was said in this article that you</text>
  <text start="1244.98" dur="4.08">know I didn&amp;#39;t think about and he says he</text>
  <text start="1247.74" dur="4.2">didn&amp;#39;t think about so it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="1249.06" dur="6.03">interesting let me let me play it for</text>
  <text start="1251.94" dur="4.89">you he had an interesting theory on the</text>
  <text start="1255.09" dur="3.24">delay that the classification and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1256.83" dur="4.49">going on with Rosenstein I&amp;#39;m gonna I</text>
  <text start="1258.33" dur="6.59">want to point out two things he makes</text>
  <text start="1261.32" dur="6.97">two points he makes number one that the</text>
  <text start="1264.92" dur="5.41">delay in firing Rosenstein at this point</text>
  <text start="1268.29" dur="3.75">may be a tactically efficient maneuver I</text>
  <text start="1270.33" dur="2.82">mean this isn&amp;#39;t really groundbreaking</text>
  <text start="1272.04" dur="2.49">but I&amp;#39;ll put it out there before we get</text>
  <text start="1273.15" dur="3.27">to the second one which is really good</text>
  <text start="1274.53" dur="3.99">because it can be used as an obvious</text>
  <text start="1276.42" dur="4.5">cudgel at this point against Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="1278.52" dur="4.69">why Joe</text>
  <text start="1280.92" dur="4.03">it&amp;#39;s gonna be obvious once the</text>
  <text start="1283.21" dur="4.349">declassification comes out of the fourth</text>

  <text start="1287.559" dur="4.591">between McCabe war and others that there</text>
  <text start="1289.48" dur="3.81">was very very serious FISA abuse I mean</text>
  <text start="1292.15" dur="3.45">none of this is new</text>
  <text start="1293.29" dur="4.32">clearly the dossier was used the fake</text>
  <text start="1295.6" dur="3.87">dossier to target American citizens and</text>
  <text start="1297.61" dur="4.74">the problem and the reason Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="1299.47" dur="5.01">has serious liability here is Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="1302.35" dur="4.32">signed the fourth FISA the last one the</text>
  <text start="1304.48" dur="4.079">third renewal right so I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1306.67" dur="3.54">you know fairly obvious that it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1308.559" dur="3.991">it can be used right now as a cudgel</text>

  <text start="1609.24" dur="7.38">sent that to me that is a great great</text>
  <text start="1612.78" dur="5.94">point that if there&amp;#39;s still loose ends</text>
  <text start="1616.62" dur="3.51">that are by the way I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="1618.72" dur="4.41">about loose ends that are actually loose</text>

  <text start="1630.99" dur="6.72">it wasn&amp;#39;t that bad we&amp;#39;ll see kind of</text>
  <text start="1634.38" dur="5.97">sort of maybe the Trump team now has</text>
  <text start="1637.71" dur="3.57">this potent weapon that says really guys</text>
  <text start="1640.35" dur="3.27">how did you come to that conclusion</text>
  <text start="1641.28" dur="5.85">because remember Trump&amp;#39;s tweet</text>
  <text start="1643.62" dur="8.13">I sent the documents over to the IG for</text>
  <text start="1647.13" dur="7.62">review brilliant right yeah that&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="1651.75" dur="4.32">that I&amp;#39;m kind of you know listen you</text>

  <text start="1661.74" dur="3.27">these matters we do a lot of research</text>
  <text start="1663.36" dur="3.48">but sometimes we I miss that I was</text>
  <text start="1665.01" dur="4.32">really upset that that didn&amp;#39;t occur to</text>
  <text start="1666.84" dur="5.64">me why and I remember thinking why the</text>
  <text start="1669.33" dur="6.06">IG why the IG why the IG first now it</text>
  <text start="1672.48" dur="4.31">makes a world a sense the Inspector</text>
  <text start="1675.39" dur="3.78">General is gonna put out this report</text>
