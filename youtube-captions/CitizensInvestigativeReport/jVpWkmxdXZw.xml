  <text start="13.889" dur="3.81">just walk folks at home through a</text>
  <text start="15.509" dur="5.251">tick-tock of events this call took place</text>
  <text start="17.699" dur="6.181">on July 25th it was a half-hour call</text>
  <text start="20.76" dur="5.82">between 1903 and 933 a.m. and the</text>
  <text start="23.88" dur="4.739">transcript is approximately five pages</text>
  <text start="26.58" dur="4.289">in length it begins with the president</text>
  <text start="28.619" dur="4.62">congratulating the Ukrainian President</text>
  <text start="30.869" dur="5.401">on his election victory then they have a</text>
  <text start="33.239" dur="5.041">very specific discussion about foreign</text>
  <text start="36.27" dur="4.35">aid the president says the u.s. is a</text>
  <text start="38.28" dur="4.11">strong supporter of Ukraine and then he</text>
  <text start="40.62" dur="4.47">complains that the Europeans are not</text>
  <text start="42.39" dur="4.59">doing enough to support that country and</text>
  <text start="45.09" dur="4.289">then this is the key part of the</text>
  <text start="46.98" dur="4.71">transcript there is an ask for the</text>
  <text start="49.379" dur="4.981">president to the Ukrainian counterpart</text>
  <text start="51.69" dur="4.29">and it reads I would like you to do us a</text>
  <text start="54.36" dur="3.21">favor though because our country has</text>
  <text start="55.98" dur="3.45">been through a lot in Ukraine knows a</text>
  <text start="57.57" dur="3.27">lot about it I would like you to find</text>
  <text start="59.43" dur="3.75">out what happened with this whole</text>
  <text start="60.84" dur="3.179">situation with Ukraine they say</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="3.06">CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="64.019" dur="5.041">that appears to be a reference to the</text>
  <text start="66.24" dur="4.41">hacking of the Clinton emails in 2016 I</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="4.32">guess you have one of your wealthy</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="5.52">people the server they say Ukraine has</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="5.4">it and then he continues this is the</text>
  <text start="76.17" dur="5.16">most fulsome discussion of Joe Biden and</text>
  <text start="78.78" dur="4.199">his son hunter Biden there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="81.33" dur="3.75">talk about Biden&amp;#39;s son that Biden</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="3.871">stopped the prosecution and a lot of</text>
  <text start="85.08" dur="3.6">people want to find out about that so</text>
  <text start="86.85" dur="3.69">whatever you can do with the attorney</text>
  <text start="88.68" dur="4.11">general would be great that&amp;#39;s Attorney</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="4.23">General William bar Biden went about</text>
  <text start="92.79" dur="3.99">bragging that he stopped the prosecution</text>
  <text start="94.77" dur="4.26">so if you can look into it it sounds</text>
  <text start="96.78" dur="4.5">horrible to me then the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="4.56">president responds talking about the</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="4.14">prosecutor he will have in place to look</text>
  <text start="103.59" dur="4.29">specifically at this issue that relates</text>
  <text start="105.42" dur="4.71">to the natural gas company charisma he</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="4.349">states he or she will look into the</text>
  <text start="110.13" dur="4.05">situation specifically to the company</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="3.6">that you mentioned in this issue the</text>
  <text start="114.18" dur="4.439">issue of the investigation of the case</text>
  <text start="115.829" dur="4.741">is actually the issue to restore the</text>
  <text start="118.619" dur="4.5">honesty seems to be a reference to</text>
  <text start="120.57" dur="4.17">integrity sort of anti-corruption so we</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="4.29">will take care of that and we will work</text>
  <text start="124.74" dur="4.889">on the investigation of the case mr.</text>
  <text start="127.409" dur="4.41">Trump then responds I will have mr.</text>
  <text start="129.629" dur="3.961">Giuliani give you a call and I&amp;#39;m always</text>
  <text start="131.819" dur="3.571">going to have Attorney General bar call</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="3.509">and we will get to the bottom of it I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="135.39" dur="3.629">sure you will figure it out</text>
  <text start="137.099" dur="3.75">the key thing from the initial reading</text>
  <text start="139.019" dur="3.901">of this transcript bill is that there</text>
  <text start="140.849" dur="4.11">are not multiple references as widely</text>
  <text start="142.92" dur="4.56">reported to the former vice president</text>
  <text start="144.959" dur="4.741">and his son based on our count there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="147.48" dur="4.319">key reference and then some follow-on</text>
  <text start="149.7" dur="4.489">references so a handful approximately</text>
  <text start="151.799" dur="4.86">three and then I would also emphasize</text>
  <text start="154.189" dur="5.05">that there is no clear link in the</text>
  <text start="156.659" dur="5.01">transcript between this withheld aid and</text>
  <text start="159.239" dur="5.34">the promise of a prosecution in this</text>
  <text start="161.669" dur="5.25">particular case bill okay so what do we</text>
  <text start="164.579" dur="6.421">know about how all this unfolded there</text>
  <text start="166.919" dur="8.25">you you go to DOJ this morning and what</text>
  <text start="171" dur="5.909">what happened after that Katherine well</text>
  <text start="175.169" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;ve learned more from Justice</text>
  <text start="176.909" dur="4.8">Department officials about the the</text>
  <text start="178.709" dur="4.98">tick-tock of events so what we now know</text>
  <text start="181.709" dur="4.59">through our briefing is that it was</text>
  <text start="183.689" dur="5.071">White House officials who told the</text>
  <text start="186.299" dur="4.86">whistleblower about this call between</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="4.589">the president and the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="191.159" dur="4.351">president they also confirmed that the</text>
  <text start="193.349" dur="4.56">whistleblower did not have first-hand or</text>
  <text start="195.51" dur="4.86">direct knowledge of the complaint and</text>
  <text start="197.909" dur="4.2">the phone call and then there&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="200.37" dur="3.479">important quote I hope you can bring up</text>
  <text start="202.109" dur="3.96">from what&amp;#39;s called an office of legal</text>
  <text start="203.849" dur="4.59">counsel opinion this is a legal opinion</text>
  <text start="206.069" dur="5.04">from the Justice Department on the</text>
  <text start="208.439" dur="4.83">whistleblower it says although the IC IG</text>
  <text start="211.109" dur="4.681">so that&amp;#39;s the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="213.269" dur="5.851">Inspector General&amp;#39;s preliminary review</text>
  <text start="215.79" dur="6.24">found quote some indicia that means</text>
  <text start="219.12" dur="5.13">indications of an arguable political</text>
  <text start="222.03" dur="4.199">bias on the part of the complainant</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="5.37">complainant is the whistleblower in</text>
  <text start="226.229" dur="6.48">favor of a rival political candidate the</text>
  <text start="229.62" dur="5.149">IC IG the watchdog concluded that the</text>
  <text start="232.709" dur="4.351">whistleblowers allegations nonetheless</text>
  <text start="234.769" dur="3.97">appeared to be credible so what we</text>
  <text start="237.06" dur="4.169">learned is that White House officials</text>
  <text start="238.739" dur="4.291">were familiar with the call they passed</text>
  <text start="241.229" dur="3.54">that information to the whistleblower</text>
  <text start="243.03" dur="3.87">the Inspector General for the</text>
  <text start="244.769" dur="3.87">intelligence community recognized that</text>
  <text start="246.9" dur="3.299">this was hearsay or secondhand</text>
  <text start="248.639" dur="3.541">information and that also the</text>
  <text start="250.199" dur="4.26">whistleblower had some kind of political</text>
  <text start="252.18" dur="4.14">bias but he still felt that the</text>
  <text start="254.459" dur="4.89">allegations were credible enough to</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="6.12">investigate that set into motion a</text>
  <text start="259.349" dur="4.651">series of events over the last month</text>
  <text start="262.44" dur="2.19">there was a referral to the Justice</text>
  <text start="264" dur="3.9">Department</text>
  <text start="264.63" dur="5.79">also a referral to the FBI over whether</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="5.52">the president&amp;#39;s asked on that phone call</text>
  <text start="270.42" dur="5.85">amounted to a campaign finance violation</text>
  <text start="273.42" dur="5.55">so what they had to show legally is that</text>
  <text start="276.27" dur="6">the president asked for information</text>
  <text start="278.97" dur="5.22">related to the Biden&amp;#39;s was a quote thing</text>
  <text start="282.27" dur="4.71">of value and what Justice Department</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="5.43">officials have told us is that this ask</text>
  <text start="286.98" dur="6.12">did not reach that threshold so a</text>
  <text start="289.62" dur="5.64">criminal investigation was not opened</text>
  <text start="293.1" dur="4.5">and they consider the campaign finance</text>
  <text start="295.26" dur="6.14">violation of this to be closed</text>

  <text start="569.899" dur="4.351">and then he goes into the email how cute</text>
  <text start="572.6" dur="4.82">do it by the book and it would normally</text>
  <text start="574.25" dur="6.319">proceed by the book so what happened was</text>
  <text start="577.42" dur="5.979">basically a counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="580.569" dur="4.45">operation was ordered against the</text>
  <text start="583.399" dur="4.13">president that&amp;#39;s different than an</text>
  <text start="585.019" dur="6.601">investigation it&amp;#39;s a counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="587.529" dur="5.591">investigation so by by the book they</text>
  <text start="591.62" dur="4.17">didn&amp;#39;t have to tell the president about</text>
  <text start="593.12" dur="5.25">it and they didn&amp;#39;t have they could lie</text>
  <text start="595.79" dur="6.06">to him and they this is why Jim Comey</text>
  <text start="598.37" dur="5.159">and in Rob Rosenstein and Andy McCabe</text>
  <text start="601.85" dur="3.599">and all those guys lied and said oh</text>

  <text start="941.25" dur="4.99">Germany does almost nothing for you all</text>
  <text start="944.35" dur="3.33">they do is talk and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="946.24" dur="3.36">something that you should really ask</text>
  <text start="947.68" dur="4.11">them about when I was speaking with</text>

  <text start="953.8" dur="4.31">European countries are the same way so I</text>
  <text start="956.11" dur="4.35">think it&amp;#39;s something you want to look</text>
  <text start="958.11" dur="4.72">look at but the United States has been</text>
  <text start="960.46" dur="4.23">very good to the Ukraine I wouldn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="962.83" dur="3.36">that it&amp;#39;s reciprocal necessarily because</text>
  <text start="964.69" dur="4.59">things are happening that are not good</text>
  <text start="966.19" dur="5.55">but the United States has been very very</text>

  <text start="977.98" dur="3.15">not reciprocal yet because what</text>
  <text start="979.45" dur="4.04">President Trump knows is that a lot of</text>
  <text start="981.13" dur="5.49">the origins of the Marussia</text>
  <text start="983.49" dur="7.15">investigation has to do with the Ukraine</text>
  <text start="986.62" dur="6.9">and he says yes you&amp;#39;re absolutely right</text>
  <text start="990.64" dur="5.4">not what not only 100% but actually</text>
  <text start="993.52" dur="5.04">1,000% and I can tell you the following</text>
  <text start="996.04" dur="5.64">I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did</text>
  <text start="998.56" dur="5.01">meet with her I also met with Makran and</text>
  <text start="1001.68" dur="3.63">told I told them that they are not doing</text>
  <text start="1003.57" dur="4.62">quite as much as they need to be doing</text>
  <text start="1005.31" dur="4.62">on the issue with the sanctions they are</text>
  <text start="1008.19" dur="3.21">not enforcing the sanctions they are not</text>
  <text start="1009.93" dur="3.72">working as much as they should work for</text>
  <text start="1011.4" dur="4.53">the Ukraine it turns out though even</text>
  <text start="1013.65" dur="3.96">though logically the European Union</text>
  <text start="1015.93" dur="3.51">should be our biggest partner but</text>
  <text start="1017.61" dur="3.6">technically the United States is a much</text>
  <text start="1019.44" dur="4.29">bigger partner than the European Union</text>
  <text start="1021.21" dur="4.14">and I&amp;#39;m very grateful to you for that</text>
  <text start="1023.73" dur="3.99">because the United States is doing quite</text>
  <text start="1025.35" dur="3.87">a lot for the Ukraine much more than the</text>

  <text start="1029.22" dur="5.37">you&amp;#39;ve already done so you&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="1031.62" dur="4.98">done so much for us more much more than</text>
  <text start="1034.59" dur="3.6">the European Union especially when we</text>
  <text start="1036.6" dur="6.21">are talking about sanctions against the</text>
  <text start="1038.19" dur="6.12">Russian Federation we&amp;#39;re doing more than</text>

  <text start="1068.67" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s so true</text>
  <text start="1070.05" dur="4.2">can you see President Trump going for</text>

  <text start="1104.7" dur="4.92">how to go about it he&amp;#39;s going straight</text>
  <text start="1106.46" dur="4.99">for the origins how did this whole thing</text>
  <text start="1109.62" dur="4.14">get started before there ever was a</text>
  <text start="1111.45" dur="6.87">counterintelligence because if you can</text>
  <text start="1113.76" dur="7.14">prove that the whole thing began with</text>

  <text start="1120.9" dur="6.24">before the counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="1123.32" dur="5.41">investigation started then then you can</text>

  <text start="1128.73" dur="3.39">been a counterintelligence okay so</text>
  <text start="1130.89" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s dealing with and he</text>
