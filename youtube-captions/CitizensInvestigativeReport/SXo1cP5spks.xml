  <text start="2073.359" dur="7.971">Hillary Clinton maybe even Bill Clinton</text>

  <text start="2089.8" dur="3.72">we know everything about you we know</text>
  <text start="2091.51" dur="4.74">everything about your wife we know you</text>
  <text start="2093.52" dur="4.2">know and you want to be safe so we have</text>
  <text start="2096.25" dur="4.23">a task for you we want you to wear a</text>
  <text start="2097.72" dur="6.03">wire when you meet with Trump and then</text>
  <text start="2100.48" dur="5.639">we want to utilize that information in</text>
  <text start="2103.75" dur="2.88">in ways in which that we can remove him</text>
  <text start="2106.119" dur="2.851">okay</text>
  <text start="2106.63" dur="4.29">so you&amp;#39;ve got to wear a wire and if you</text>
  <text start="2108.97" dur="5.76">don&amp;#39;t well there&amp;#39;s all kinds of</text>
  <text start="2110.92" dur="7.16">ramifications to that and from what I</text>
  <text start="2114.73" dur="6.21">understand Rosenstein at that point</text>
  <text start="2118.08" dur="5.92">agreed to wear a wire this wasn&amp;#39;t his</text>
  <text start="2120.94" dur="5.34">idea okay it speak and understand</text>
  <text start="2124" dur="3.36">something I&amp;#39;m not trying to make excuses</text>
  <text start="2126.28" dur="5.7">for rose</text>
  <text start="2127.36" dur="6.33">Steen III I have I look at that guy and</text>
  <text start="2131.98" dur="4.31">he reminds me some other people I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2133.69" dur="6.21">dealt with in Washington and frankly</text>
  <text start="2136.29" dur="5.8">I&amp;#39;ll be diplomatic the guy&amp;#39;s creepy I</text>
  <text start="2139.9" dur="6.33">won&amp;#39;t tell you how I really feel</text>
  <text start="2142.09" dur="6.09">I&amp;#39;ll just say he seems creepy okay I you</text>
  <text start="2146.23" dur="4.77">wouldn&amp;#39;t catch me having a beer with</text>
  <text start="2148.18" dur="5.19">this guy did he ever wear the wire so</text>
  <text start="2151" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s my understanding he did wear a wire</text>
  <text start="2153.37" dur="4.83">not when he met with Trump he&amp;#39;s wearing</text>
  <text start="2155.2" dur="5.22">a wire in his office because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2158.2" dur="3.39">staying well you know I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="2160.42" dur="3">nervous about this whole thing and I</text>
  <text start="2161.59" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t want to seem unnatural because he</text>
  <text start="2163.42" dur="3.75">can&amp;#39;t wear a wire into the White House</text>
  <text start="2165.79" dur="4.77">because they would have picked it up on</text>
  <text start="2167.17" dur="4.68">his on a screen so the I get they think</text>
  <text start="2170.56" dur="4.05">the plan might have been he was gonna</text>
  <text start="2171.85" dur="5.25">meet Trump at some event and then try to</text>
  <text start="2174.61" dur="3.93">ask him some questions to kind of you</text>
  <text start="2177.1" dur="2.28">know wound up on something and then</text>
  <text start="2178.54" dur="4.32">right</text>
  <text start="2179.38" dur="6.36">so he&amp;#39;s wearing the wire is kind of like</text>
  <text start="2182.86" dur="7.44">a practice situation and as I understand</text>
  <text start="2185.74" dur="15.63">it some people walk into his office call</text>
  <text start="2190.3" dur="16.37">me McCabe Strock and Paige and he</text>
  <text start="2201.37" dur="8.04">doesn&amp;#39;t say this he does not say hey I</text>
  <text start="2206.67" dur="4.92">I&amp;#39;m gonna wear a white because the New</text>
  <text start="2209.41" dur="5.01">York Times story is according to McCabe</text>
  <text start="2211.59" dur="4.78">Rosenstein said I&amp;#39;m gonna wear a wire to</text>
  <text start="2214.42" dur="5.16">monitor Trump so we can get him thrown</text>
  <text start="2216.37" dur="6.54">out of office as I understand it</text>
  <text start="2219.58" dur="6.27">Rosenstein did not say that in fact one</text>
  <text start="2222.91" dur="4.89">of the other four and as best as I can</text>
  <text start="2225.85" dur="2.52">kind of determine based on what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2227.8" dur="2.37">been told</text>
  <text start="2228.37" dur="6.12">it could well have come out of Kobe&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2230.17" dur="6.29">mouth hey Rosenstein you should start</text>
  <text start="2234.49" dur="6">wearing you should wear a wire in</text>
  <text start="2236.46" dur="8.49">talking to Trump and that can be used to</text>
  <text start="2240.49" dur="6.54">get rid of him okay okay Vicki told</text>
  <text start="2244.95" dur="3.88">let&amp;#39;s go back to let&amp;#39;s go back to</text>
  <text start="2247.03" dur="5.96">Giuliani in that picture so this was</text>
  <text start="2248.83" dur="7.92">long before July 10th okay Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="2252.99" dur="6.1">had an affiliation with Giuliani because</text>
  <text start="2256.75" dur="4.599">of Giuliani&amp;#39;s work in the Justice</text>
  <text start="2259.09" dur="9.159">Department over many decades time</text>
  <text start="2261.349" dur="10.16">and I truly believe that Giuliani based</text>
  <text start="2268.249" dur="6.83">on what I&amp;#39;ve been told has enormous ties</text>
  <text start="2271.509" dur="6.79">at all levels of the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="2275.079" dur="6.13">right I mean from people who wash the</text>
  <text start="2278.299" dur="8.96">floors we&amp;#39;ve known him for years two</text>
  <text start="2281.209" dur="14.06">secretaries two attorneys two officials</text>
  <text start="2287.259" dur="14.31">and Giuliani got wind about the wire and</text>
  <text start="2295.269" dur="11.55">I believe the Giuliani approached</text>
  <text start="2301.569" dur="9.7">Rosenstein instead look I understand</text>
  <text start="2306.819" dur="7.72">that you&amp;#39;ve been asked to do something</text>
  <text start="2311.269" dur="10.1">and we both know that that&amp;#39;s a bad thing</text>
  <text start="2314.539" dur="13.82">to do and an illegal thing to do so</text>
  <text start="2321.369" dur="10.21">let&amp;#39;s talk about you playing for us and</text>
  <text start="2328.359" dur="6.19">in playing for us we can lend some</text>
  <text start="2331.579" dur="6.96">protection to you so that the</text>
  <text start="2334.549" dur="6.93">individuals that wanted you to do this</text>
  <text start="2338.539" dur="10.861">cannot inflict harm on you your family</text>
  <text start="2341.479" dur="12.09">or your career that&amp;#39;s what that occurred</text>
  <text start="2349.4" dur="7.26">and that&amp;#39;s why posted steam never ever</text>
  <text start="2353.569" dur="7.88">wore a wire around Trump but what he</text>
  <text start="2356.66" dur="7.109">might have done is kept that wire on and</text>
  <text start="2361.449" dur="3.31">monitored some other deep State players</text>
  <text start="2363.769" dur="4.29">oh boy</text>
  <text start="2364.759" dur="7.5">and I believe I believe when the deep</text>
  <text start="2368.059" dur="8.73">state saw Rosenstein an Air Force One</text>
  <text start="2372.259" dur="6.36">with Trump in that skiff they thought</text>
  <text start="2376.789" dur="5.31">and they couldn&amp;#39;t monitor what was going</text>
  <text start="2378.619" dur="7.71">on because it was a SCIF facility they</text>
  <text start="2382.099" dur="5.97">were like oh my gosh oh my gosh this guy</text>
  <text start="2386.329" dur="5.76">was part and parcel of a number of our</text>
  <text start="2388.069" dur="7.071">discussions this guy he didn&amp;#39;t wear the</text>
  <text start="2392.089" dur="3.051">wire on Trump and</text>
  <text start="2395.529" dur="7">he they got all this information they</text>
  <text start="2398.72" dur="5.579">ward on him he word on them right so but</text>
  <text start="2402.529" dur="6.54">but remember and you mentioned this</text>
  <text start="2404.299" dur="7.5">before with with Powell right could</text>
  <text start="2409.069" dur="5.94">could there be almost this professional</text>
  <text start="2411.799" dur="6.3">wrestling relationship where they are in</text>
  <text start="2415.009" dur="5.671">the ring in the public and pounding on</text>
  <text start="2418.099" dur="4.02">each other I&amp;#39;ll be a kind of fake</text>
  <text start="2420.68" dur="4.079">that&amp;#39;s the chips and Clara thinks and</text>
  <text start="2422.119" dur="6.571">then they go into the locker room and</text>
  <text start="2424.759" dur="5.671">they have dinner together yeah well well</text>
  <text start="2428.69" dur="4.919">there&amp;#39;s a I think there&amp;#39;s a fair amount</text>
  <text start="2430.43" dur="5.73">of that going on here yeah and it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2433.609" dur="6.031">just and I don&amp;#39;t think it just stays</text>
  <text start="2436.16" dur="4.889">with Powell III think that actually and</text>
  <text start="2439.64" dur="5.27">I know a lot of people will disagree</text>
  <text start="2441.049" dur="6.181">with me and please save your emails I</text>
  <text start="2444.91" dur="5.74">understand your opinion and you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2447.23" dur="5.7">disagree with me but I truly believe</text>
  <text start="2450.65" dur="5.81">that that same type of relationship</text>
  <text start="2452.93" dur="8.849">could well be the case with sessions</text>
  <text start="2456.46" dur="8.95">yeah yeah I&amp;#39;ll tell you why and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2461.779" dur="6.451">because sessions are appointed many</text>

  <text start="2661.67" dur="2.76">was the text my</text>
  <text start="2662.63" dur="4.02">it was the Pfizer document information</text>
  <text start="2664.43" dur="7.53">and it was so remember the woods</text>
  <text start="2666.65" dur="6.659">procedure file that&amp;#39;s the file that if</text>
  <text start="2671.96" dur="3.319">you don&amp;#39;t know you know go back and</text>
  <text start="2673.309" dur="4.47">listen to my it&amp;#39;s I think it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="2675.279" dur="5.921">it&amp;#39;s about sessions it&amp;#39;s got sessions in</text>
  <text start="2677.779" dur="7.141">the title podcast that I made couple</text>
  <text start="2681.2" dur="6.419">weeks ago but it comes all full circle</text>
  <text start="2684.92" dur="5.849">and then on that same right afterwards</text>
  <text start="2687.619" dur="5.94">like all these people were just tweeting</text>
  <text start="2690.769" dur="4.59">this crazy stuff I mean well anyway let</text>
  <text start="2693.559" dur="4.71">me not jump all over the place the woods</text>
  <text start="2695.359" dur="5.581">file the woods procedure is a prison</text>
  <text start="2698.269" dur="7.441">like really crazy procedure that has to</text>
  <text start="2700.94" dur="7.679">go on in order to verify information in</text>
  <text start="2705.71" dur="4.859">an application to the FISA Court and and</text>
  <text start="2708.619" dur="7.021">I&amp;#39;ve explained it in full in past videos</text>
  <text start="2710.569" dur="6.18">on YouTube and also on my podcast I went</text>
  <text start="2715.64" dur="3.419">right through what the whole woods</text>
  <text start="2716.749" dur="4.77">procedure is so it&amp;#39;s very complicated</text>
  <text start="2719.059" dur="4.71">and I don&amp;#39;t think it was done here and</text>
  <text start="2721.519" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re requesting like hey</text>
  <text start="2723.769" dur="3.871">how did you guys vet this uh what kind</text>
  <text start="2726.319" dur="2.91">of woods procedure and not only did they</text>
  <text start="2727.64" dur="3.719">not do it once they didn&amp;#39;t do it four</text>
  <text start="2729.229" dur="4.14">times because it was renewed for you</text>
  <text start="2731.359" dur="3.71">know it was submitted once and then</text>
  <text start="2733.369" dur="4.261">renewed three more times after that so</text>
  <text start="2735.069" dur="4.96">that&amp;#39;s what he was required to turn over</text>
  <text start="2737.63" dur="3.209">and because we didn&amp;#39;t hear how that</text>
  <text start="2740.029" dur="2.79">turned out</text>
  <text start="2740.839" dur="5.76">he must have turned it over I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2742.819" dur="7.081">ridiculous alright so then so then Trump</text>
  <text start="2746.599" dur="6.27">pulled back his declassification of the</text>
  <text start="2749.9" dur="4.949">FBI documents because it&amp;#39;s not time yet</text>
  <text start="2752.869" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s not time he doesn&amp;#39;t want to be a</text>
  <text start="2754.849" dur="5.791">charged with like violation of the Hatch</text>
  <text start="2756.619" dur="5.67">Act which basically you can&amp;#39;t do any</text>
  <text start="2760.64" dur="4.409">kind of there&amp;#39;s all kinds of rules to it</text>
  <text start="2762.289" dur="4.411">but you can&amp;#39;t do anything prior thirty</text>
  <text start="2765.049" dur="4.5">days prior to the election and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2766.7" dur="4.44">why for those of you who follow q and on</text>
  <text start="2769.549" dur="3.27">that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re not hearing from q I</text>
  <text start="2771.14" dur="4.199">fully believe that and I&amp;#39;ll be making a</text>
  <text start="2772.819" dur="5.641">youtube video going over neon revolts</text>

  <text start="2794.719" dur="4.251">talking about here</text>
  <text start="2796.15" dur="6.12">I just think it&amp;#39;s interesting that they</text>
  <text start="2798.97" dur="6.149">never bring any of you know sessions</text>
  <text start="2802.27" dur="4.86">going to see Huber the word is that</text>
  <text start="2805.119" dur="5.071">sessions has also met with some supreme</text>
  <text start="2807.13" dur="5.1">some some of the Supreme Court justices</text>
  <text start="2810.19" dur="4.53">and all like he said the domino effect</text>
  <text start="2812.23" dur="6.329">and he met with the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="2814.72" dur="6.74">justices to kind of be advised on</text>
  <text start="2818.559" dur="5.191">whether he can Unruh cues himself and</text>
  <text start="2821.46" dur="3.609">that&amp;#39;s a cue and on that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="2823.75" dur="3.48">cueing on his told us there&amp;#39;s been no</text>
  <text start="2825.069" dur="4.381">articles about it but it&amp;#39;s weird how</text>
  <text start="2827.23" dur="4.77">they don&amp;#39;t report on stuff like that but</text>
  <text start="2829.45" dur="5.07">even Fox News doesn&amp;#39;t report that Fox</text>
  <text start="2832" dur="3.96">News doesn&amp;#39;t report on Hueber everybody</text>
  <text start="2834.52" dur="3.539">you hear on there&amp;#39;s like oh we need a</text>
  <text start="2835.96" dur="5.76">second special counsel we need a special</text>
  <text start="2838.059" dur="6.151">counsel we need well we have one because</text>
  <text start="2841.72" dur="4.05">John Huber according to dr. Turley an</text>
  <text start="2844.21" dur="3.96">article written by Breitbart back</text>
  <text start="2845.77" dur="4.71">November of last year well let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="2848.17" dur="5.189">woman&amp;#39;s an April of last year April or</text>
  <text start="2850.48" dur="5.67">May when sessions came out and said told</text>
  <text start="2853.359" dur="5.581">us about Huber he&amp;#39;s been he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="2856.15" dur="6.149">working since November of 2017 so full</text>
  <text start="2858.94" dur="5.099">year coming up he&amp;#39;s been working on</text>
  <text start="2862.299" dur="5.701">grand juries and he has a team of</text>
  <text start="2864.039" dur="6.211">prosecutors it&amp;#39;s not just him basically</text>
  <text start="2868" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;ve had to bypass the FBI and the</text>
  <text start="2870.25" dur="5.069">DOJ right and so we&amp;#39;ve had the IG</text>
  <text start="2873.43" dur="4.26">working on the investigative side and</text>
  <text start="2875.319" dur="4.53">referring things to Huber on the</text>
  <text start="2877.69" dur="6.57">prosecute prosecutorial side working in</text>
  <text start="2879.849" dur="6.69">lieu of the DOJ because when they first</text>
  <text start="2884.26" dur="3.72">started everything was completely</text>
  <text start="2886.539" dur="2.941">corrupt it&amp;#39;s getting cleaned out we have</text>
  <text start="2887.98" dur="2.67">some smaller players to get out of there</text>
  <text start="2889.48" dur="3.45">now but they&amp;#39;ve got to get out because</text>
  <text start="2890.65" dur="3.33">he&amp;#39;s Lee as you&amp;#39;ve seen lately little</text>
  <text start="2892.93" dur="2.52">players can make a big difference</text>
  <text start="2893.98" dur="4.17">somebody can leak something and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2895.45" dur="5.099">just a nobody and it you know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2898.15" dur="4.56">problem so until this is completely</text>
