  <text start="902.28" dur="5.04">out corruption and what happens mostly</text>
  <text start="904.74" dur="4.53">in the 2016 election because there was</text>
  <text start="907.32" dur="3.27">tremendous corruption in the 2016</text>
  <text start="909.27" dur="4.47">election I think even you would admit</text>
  <text start="910.59" dur="5.46">that the election was it was disgraceful</text>
  <text start="913.74" dur="4.41">what happened and what happened to me</text>
  <text start="916.05" dur="4.62">and what happened to the Republicans and</text>
  <text start="918.15" dur="5.01">that continues with Nancy Pelosi and</text>
  <text start="920.67" dur="3.96">wish if Adam Schiff got caught making up</text>
  <text start="923.16" dur="3.51">statements that he said I said that I</text>
  <text start="924.63" dur="5.49">didn&amp;#39;t say which is fraud I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="926.67" dur="5.34">purely fraudulent so it continues so</text>
  <text start="930.12" dur="3.33">Rudy was a great prosecutor he was the</text>
  <text start="932.01" dur="3.12">best mayor in the history of the city of</text>
  <text start="933.45" dur="3.54">New York as far as I couldn&amp;#39;t see I</text>
  <text start="935.13" dur="3.3">think he&amp;#39;s pretty much acknowledged what</text>
  <text start="936.99" dur="3.81">he did with her crime and everything</text>
  <text start="938.43" dur="5.46">else and when he saw what was going on</text>
  <text start="940.8" dur="5.73">with our election of 2016 the election I</text>
  <text start="943.89" dur="5.43">won in the election that was absolutely</text>
  <text start="946.53" dur="4.29">corrupted by things that took place in</text>
  <text start="949.32" dur="3.77">government now we&amp;#39;ll see what happens</text>
  <text start="950.82" dur="4.86">the IG reports gonna come out soon and</text>
  <text start="953.09" dur="5.23">we&amp;#39;ll see what happens I think people I</text>
  <text start="955.68" dur="4.35">know nothing about it in terms of the</text>
  <text start="958.32" dur="4.08">report I&amp;#39;m waiting for the report like</text>
  <text start="960.03" dur="3.78">everybody else but I predict you will</text>
  <text start="962.4" dur="4.23">see things that you don&amp;#39;t even believe</text>
  <text start="963.81" dur="6.6">the level of corruption whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="966.63" dur="6.99">combing whether it&amp;#39;s struck in his lover</text>
  <text start="970.41" dur="5.64">page whether it&amp;#39;s so many other people</text>
  <text start="973.62" dur="4.14">McCain whether it&amp;#39;s President Obama</text>
  <text start="976.05" dur="3.66">himself let&amp;#39;s see whether or not it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="977.76" dur="3.96">President Obama let&amp;#39;s see whether or not</text>
  <text start="979.71" dur="5.28">they put that in wait a minute let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="981.72" dur="5.04">whether or not so Rudy saw that and I</text>
  <text start="984.99" dur="6.18">can tell you Rudy Giuliani because he</text>
  <text start="986.76" dur="6.35">was very very incensed at the horrible</text>
  <text start="991.17" dur="4.59">things that he saw as are many people</text>
  <text start="993.11" dur="3.91">okay and many Republicans and the</text>
  <text start="995.76" dur="3.44">Republicans have been treated very</text>
  <text start="997.02" dur="4.98">unfairly by the Democrats I&amp;#39;ll say this</text>
  <text start="999.2" dur="4.51">Paul Ryan would never issue a subpoena I</text>
  <text start="1002" dur="3.45">don&amp;#39;t say right or wrong he wouldn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1003.71" dur="4.53">it he had too much respect for our</text>
  <text start="1005.45" dur="4.86">country Nancy Pelosi hands about like</text>
  <text start="1008.24" dur="4.89">cookies what the Democrats are doing to</text>
  <text start="1010.31" dur="5.1">this nation is a disgrace what they have</text>
  <text start="1013.13" dur="4.14">done the disrespect that they&amp;#39;ve shown</text>
  <text start="1015.41" dur="4.739">to the presidency</text>
  <text start="1017.27" dur="5.759">and it&amp;#39;ll happen to them because if the</text>
  <text start="1020.149" dur="4.92">Republicans have the house which I think</text>
  <text start="1023.029" dur="3.771">they will because of impeachment I think</text>
  <text start="1025.069" dur="4.471">that because it does nonsense</text>
  <text start="1026.8" dur="3.7">impeachment now all of a sudden shift</text>
  <text start="1029.54" dur="3.45">doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk to the</text>
  <text start="1030.5" dur="4.47">whistleblower now all of a sudden quid</text>
  <text start="1032.99" dur="4.079">pro quo doesn&amp;#39;t matter because now they</text>
  <text start="1034.97" dur="5.099">see in the call there was no quid pro</text>
  <text start="1037.069" dur="4.86">quo so with Rudy Rudy was thinking that</text>
  <text start="1040.069" dur="4.221">corruption and I think there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="1041.929" dur="5.191">wrong with seeking that corruption pure</text>
  <text start="1044.29" dur="6.67">corruption for instance I still ask the</text>
  <text start="1047.12" dur="7.26">FBI where is the server how come the FBI</text>
  <text start="1050.96" dur="4.98">never got the server from the DNC where</text>
  <text start="1054.38" dur="4.95">is the server I want to see the server</text>
  <text start="1055.94" dur="7.17">let&amp;#39;s see what&amp;#39;s on the server so the</text>
  <text start="1059.33" dur="7.11">server they say is held by a company</text>
  <text start="1063.11" dur="7.14">whose primary ownership individual is</text>
  <text start="1066.44" dur="5.64">from Ukraine I&amp;#39;d like to see the server</text>
  <text start="1070.25" dur="5.52">I think it&amp;#39;s very important for this</text>

  <text start="1075.77" dur="4.11">to see it the media never wants to see</text>
  <text start="1078.23" dur="3.84">it but I&amp;#39;ll tell you Republicans want to</text>

  <text start="1082.07" dur="5.67">what here&amp;#39;s the problem I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1084.62" dur="4.89">going to take the house based on what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1087.74" dur="5.64">happening with the impeachment stuff and</text>
  <text start="1089.51" dur="6.57">the Republicans can do the same thing in</text>
  <text start="1093.38" dur="4.26">Reverse if they ever happen I hope it&amp;#39;s</text>
