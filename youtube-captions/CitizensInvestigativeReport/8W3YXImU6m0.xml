  <text start="67.57" dur="2.97">know there&amp;#39;s an old saying in Washington</text>
  <text start="68.92" dur="4.559">that the cover-up is worse than the</text>
  <text start="70.54" dur="4.53">crime but in this case both parts of it</text>
  <text start="73.479" dur="3.841">are disturbing allegations of</text>
  <text start="75.07" dur="4.59">prostitution and pedophilia and</text>
  <text start="77.32" dur="4.68">allegations that those crimes were</text>
  <text start="79.66" dur="3.599">somehow covered up or not looked into so</text>
  <text start="82" dur="2.88">the State Department this morning is</text>
  <text start="83.259" dur="4.47">having to respond to those claims and</text>
  <text start="84.88" dur="4.29">those investigations in love misconduct</text>
  <text start="87.729" dur="4.591">by State Department officials including</text>
  <text start="89.17" dur="5.13">by an ambassador and security agents</text>
  <text start="92.32" dur="4.14">attached to then Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="94.3" dur="3.45">Hillary Clinton and the allegations are</text>
  <text start="96.46" dur="3.96">that these investigations were</text>
  <text start="97.75" dur="7.17">whitewashed quashed altogether and that</text>
  <text start="100.42" dur="6.06">those orders came from high up NBC News</text>

  <text start="145.33" dur="4.74">talk about specific cases but I can say</text>
  <text start="148.209" dur="4.201">broadly that the notion that we would</text>
  <text start="150.07" dur="5.76">not vigorously pursue criminal</text>
  <text start="152.41" dur="5.85">misconduct in a case in any case is</text>
  <text start="155.83" dur="4.02">preposterous a former investigator for</text>
  <text start="158.26" dur="3.509">the department&amp;#39;s Inspector General has</text>
  <text start="159.85" dur="4.08">complained to Congress and the media</text>
  <text start="161.769" dur="3.961">that the investigations have not been</text>
  <text start="163.93" dur="3.72">thorough because of the pressure from</text>
  <text start="165.73" dur="4.2">those high-level officials</text>
  <text start="167.65" dur="4.38">every allegation of misconduct seriously</text>
  <text start="169.93" dur="3.869">and we look into it it was less than six</text>
  <text start="172.03" dur="3.48">months ago that another major internal</text>
  <text start="173.799" dur="3.211">investigation painted Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="175.51" dur="4.35">State Department in a negative light</text>
  <text start="177.01" dur="5.16">that scathing report on the failed</text>
  <text start="179.86" dur="4.68">Diplomatic Security procedures in the</text>
  <text start="182.17" dur="4.92">aftermath of the Benghazi attack what</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="5.4">difference at this point does it make it</text>
  <text start="187.09" dur="6.3">is our job to figure out what happened</text>
  <text start="189.94" dur="5.76">as we noted the whistleblower in this</text>
  <text start="193.39" dur="3.75">case a member of the inspector general</text>
  <text start="195.7" dur="3.24">investigative team at the State</text>
  <text start="197.14" dur="4.17">Department she&amp;#39;s gone to Congress</text>
  <text start="198.94" dur="3.93">demanding an investigation and it&amp;#39;s our</text>

  <text start="202.87" dur="3.899">the leading Republican and House Foreign</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="4.44">Relations says he does plan on having an</text>
  <text start="206.769" dur="3.661">investigation and no doubt hearings are</text>
  <text start="208.78" dur="3.39">probably going to come soon as well</text>
  <text start="210.43" dur="3.479">Savannah but Chuck where are we on this</text>
  <text start="212.17" dur="3.179">is at this point just allegations from</text>
  <text start="213.909" dur="4.591">one whistleblower have they been</text>
  <text start="215.349" dur="5.071">substantiated in any way well here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.5" dur="3.75">what it is the the whistleblower says</text>
  <text start="220.42" dur="3.62">that this report that the internal</text>
  <text start="222.25" dur="4.65">investigation having to do with how</text>
  <text start="224.04" dur="4.779">Diplomatic Security even investigated</text>
  <text start="226.9" dur="3.98">these allegations that&amp;#39;s where this</text>
  <text start="228.819" dur="4.681">scathing report came from it&amp;#39;s how the</text>
  <text start="230.88" dur="4.18">investigators somehow dropped the</text>
  <text start="233.5" dur="3.69">investigations including into this</text>
  <text start="235.06" dur="3.57">ambassador and on to some other deal</text>
  <text start="237.19" dur="2.4">including on folks that were part of</text>
  <text start="238.63" dur="3.09">security detail</text>
  <text start="239.59" dur="4.53">so the allegations himself haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="241.72" dur="4.379">fully substantiated by by us but this</text>
  <text start="244.12" dur="4.11">inspector general whistleblower believes</text>
  <text start="246.099" dur="4.11">that the evidence was clear but the</text>
  <text start="248.23" dur="4.95">problem was the investigation wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="4.59">done in time to find out for sure if</text>
  <text start="253.18" dur="4.26">this misconduct was happening I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="254.799" dur="6.861">organized that this is a very famous</text>

  <text start="439.35" dur="6.15">what the finders hide what I wanted to</text>
  <text start="442.02" dur="7.5">note though is how interesting it was</text>
  <text start="445.5" dur="7.02">that on page 40 and 49 we have a</text>

  <text start="456.6" dur="5.55">note that it was included within the</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="7.8">same documents as the finders as backup</text>
  <text start="462.15" dur="6.6">support so that&amp;#39;s page 48 and 49 of the</text>
  <text start="466.41" dur="4.89">finders report the link to that will be</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="4.47">in the description of this video what</text>
  <text start="471.3" dur="3.81">follows again is a video is a</text>
  <text start="473.22" dur="3.63">documentary part one</text>
  <text start="475.11" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s an hour documentary but I&amp;#39;m only</text>
  <text start="476.85" dur="5.76">going to be putting clips in since they</text>
