  <text start="249.709" dur="3.211">hey Anderson we had a great interview</text>
  <text start="251.569" dur="4.431">last time I was wondering if you get a</text>
  <text start="252.92" dur="5.999">chance to look into operation mocking</text>
  <text start="256" dur="4.63">you know what that is you turn up</text>
  <text start="258.919" dur="4.231">somewhere for the 1950s dude</text>

  <text start="263.15" dur="6.269">the CIA infiltrated the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="264.919" dur="5.791">from the higher up classified I read</text>

  <text start="270.71" dur="5.79">thanks do you think it&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="273.229" dur="4.771">could possibly be happening today I have</text>
  <text start="276.5" dur="5.94">no comment for you thanks dude</text>
  <text start="278" dur="5.88">why not I mean you didn&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="282.44" dur="10.92">journalistic training except CIA</text>
  <text start="283.88" dur="11.73">training do you feel it&amp;#39;s an issue of</text>
  <text start="293.36" dur="4.08">concern when it comes to kind of</text>
  <text start="295.61" dur="4.559">domestic American coverage of the world</text>
  <text start="297.44" dur="5.22">events we see a lot of coverage of</text>
  <text start="300.169" dur="5.43">Russia and a lot of coverage of Iran but</text>
  <text start="302.66" dur="4.5">not Saudi Arabia why do you think human</text>
  <text start="305.599" dur="3.301">rights violations in Saudi Arabia are</text>
  <text start="307.16" dur="5.28">not covered as extensively as they</text>
  <text start="308.9" dur="5.85">should be have you been sorry right no</text>
  <text start="312.44" dur="8.039">not yet</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="7.139">I will probably now I don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="320.479" dur="3.301">considered rude or mean when I told</text>
  <text start="321.889" dur="3.571">Anderson Cooper to his face that he</text>
  <text start="323.78" dur="3.78">received no journalism training at all</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="3.42">except for training by the CIA but</text>
  <text start="327.56" dur="3.479">that&amp;#39;s actually stated on his own</text>
  <text start="328.88" dur="4.58">Wikipedia and he admittedly was trained</text>
  <text start="331.039" dur="6.841">to be in the CIA when he was in college</text>
  <text start="333.46" dur="6.13">and received no journalism training all</text>
  <text start="337.88" dur="3.539">right so that shows you a little bit</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="3.359">about we are change and how they</text>
  <text start="341.419" dur="4.771">literally asked him I thought that was</text>
  <text start="342.949" dur="12.53">pretty funny let&amp;#39;s go to Anderson</text>
  <text start="346.19" dur="13.17">Cooper&amp;#39;s Wikipedia page here&amp;#39;s his</text>
  <text start="355.479" dur="4.93">education here so Cooper was educated at</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="2.64">the Dalton School a private</text>
  <text start="360.409" dur="4.711">co-educational University preparatory</text>
  <text start="362" dur="5.55">day school in New York City he traveled</text>
  <text start="365.12" dur="2.97">around Africa on a survival trip okay</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="4.14">wait a minute</text>
  <text start="368.09" dur="7.02">and then Cooper went on to attend Yale</text>
  <text start="371.69" dur="4.89">University okay it&amp;#39;s a private Ivy</text>
  <text start="375.11" dur="4.109">League research University in New Haven</text>
  <text start="376.58" dur="4.769">Connecticut which is home of the Skull</text>
  <text start="379.219" dur="4.141">and Bones all right and then it says</text>
  <text start="381.349" dur="5.011">during college Cooper spent suit</text>
  <text start="383.36" dur="4.709">two summers as an intern at the Central</text>
  <text start="386.36" dur="7.109">Intelligence Agency while studying</text>
  <text start="388.069" dur="8.791">political science hmm he pursued</text>
  <text start="393.469" dur="5.521">journalism with no formal journalistic</text>
  <text start="396.86" dur="8.01">education and is a self-proclaimed news</text>

  <text start="415.879" dur="8.22">on to to where we know he is now CNN ABC</text>
  <text start="419.96" dur="6.54">CNN all right now just it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="424.099" dur="4.861">interesting though to note that the Yale</text>
  <text start="426.5" dur="5.34">University and the CIA usually go</text>
  <text start="428.96" dur="5.759">hand-in-hand and if you look here let&amp;#39;s</text>
