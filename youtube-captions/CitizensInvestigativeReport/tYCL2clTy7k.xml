  <text start="1435.15" dur="5.04">ager as a prop you are functionally here</text>
  <text start="1437.67" dur="5.4">as a prop because they can&amp;#39;t impeach</text>

  <text start="1460.11" dur="5.01">so here&amp;#39;s the deal right we we have a</text>
  <text start="1462.69" dur="4.17">false accusation against the president</text>

  <text start="1468.87" dur="5.55">side made that accusation and so where</text>
  <text start="1472.05" dur="5.1">do we go from here either we look into</text>
  <text start="1474.42" dur="5.61">how the president reacted to a false</text>
  <text start="1477.15" dur="6.72">allegation against him or we look into</text>
  <text start="1480.03" dur="5.91">why for 22 months we allowed a false</text>
  <text start="1483.87" dur="3.09">accusation to tear this country apart</text>
  <text start="1485.94" dur="2.64">now to me</text>
  <text start="1486.96" dur="4.47">it seems like a far more relevant</text>
  <text start="1488.58" dur="4.95">inquiry to figure out why the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="1491.43" dur="4.14">was lied to something that you have</text>

  <text start="1503.46" dur="4.44">before the FISA Court none of that we</text>
  <text start="1505.59" dur="4.17">also would love to know why the FBI</text>
  <text start="1507.9" dur="3.39">turned from an organization that was</text>

  <text start="1518.28" dur="2.64">and the reason they were doing it is</text>
  <text start="1519.66" dur="3.36">because they didn&amp;#39;t really think that</text>
  <text start="1520.92" dur="4.11">the job of the FBI was to investigate</text>
  <text start="1523.02" dur="3.72">and proud and bring cases for</text>

  <text start="1530.58" dur="3.51">that&amp;#39;s what I really think all Americans</text>
  <text start="1532.08" dur="3.96">ought to have an interest in stopping</text>

  <text start="1537.9" dur="4.11">was one of the worst things that we</text>

  <text start="1833.16" dur="6.09">that took place and he used two terms</text>
  <text start="1837.09" dur="3.69">that again I think this committee should</text>
  <text start="1839.25" dur="4.65">find frightening is should be looking</text>
  <text start="1840.78" dur="7.11">into unauthorized surveillance and</text>

  <text start="1849.12" dur="4.14">Congress has memorandums of</text>
  <text start="1851.25" dur="3.179">understanding between the key committee</text>

  <text start="1873.56" dur="5.22">Durham&amp;#39;s doing that but this is this is</text>
  <text start="1877.19" dur="3.63">the part I think that frustrates so many</text>

  <text start="1881.96" dur="4.05">has for protecting fundamental liberties</text>
  <text start="1884.24" dur="4.14">would begin to look into those key</text>

  <text start="2389.11" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s all going to come out actually</text>
  <text start="2391.33" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;ve reviewed some additional documents</text>

  <text start="2415.3" dur="4.29">him that will come out because there&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="2419.59" dur="3.51">realms at the FBI and that&amp;#39;s gonna come</text>
  <text start="2421.51" dur="3.45">out sooner rather than later we are</text>
  <text start="2423.1" dur="4.11">facing a big week in terms of the</text>
  <text start="2424.96" dur="5.13">revelation of some of this stuff I know</text>
  <text start="2427.21" dur="4.41">that the president has announced or said</text>
  <text start="2430.09" dur="3.57">that he will declassify certain</text>
  <text start="2431.62" dur="5.37">documents he has given the authority to</text>
  <text start="2433.66" dur="4.86">the AG bill Barr to declassify some of</text>
  <text start="2436.99" dur="4.47">those documents will be revealed this</text>
  <text start="2438.52" dur="4.98">upcoming week correct well as we start</text>
  <text start="2441.46" dur="4.44">to look at some of these documents maria</text>
  <text start="2443.5" dur="4.64">bill Barr the Attorney General has been</text>
  <text start="2445.9" dur="4.21">dead set about making sure that</text>
  <text start="2448.14" dur="3.77">transparency is</text>
  <text start="2450.11" dur="3.81">therefore all Americans to view you know</text>
  <text start="2451.91" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;ve had one narrative the Democrats</text>
  <text start="2453.92" dur="4.38">had their best day when Bob Muller</text>
  <text start="2455.84" dur="4.29">actually did his press conference as he</text>
  <text start="2458.3" dur="4.65">was leaving the Department of Justice I</text>
  <text start="2460.13" dur="4.89">can tell you that the more evidence that</text>
  <text start="2462.95" dur="4.23">we see the more that the American people</text>
  <text start="2465.02" dur="4.05">can judge from the selves they&amp;#39;ll start</text>
  <text start="2467.18" dur="4.68">to understand why this president has</text>
  <text start="2469.07" dur="5.34">been so upset and why he&amp;#39;s called it you</text>
  <text start="2471.86" dur="4.71">know a hoax because indeed in many ways</text>
  <text start="2474.41" dur="4.02">it was so we&amp;#39;ll start to see some</text>
  <text start="2476.57" dur="3.39">additional documents come out this week</text>
  <text start="2478.43" dur="4.38">whether it&amp;#39;s the declassified documents</text>
  <text start="2479.96" dur="5.19">or not I&amp;#39;m not sure but I can tell you</text>
  <text start="2482.81" dur="5.58">that I have looked at documents at the</text>
  <text start="2485.15" dur="5.76">Department of Justice as has Jim Jordan</text>
  <text start="2488.39" dur="5.49">and what we saw was a very clear</text>
  <text start="2490.91" dur="4.95">indication of severe credibility issues</text>
  <text start="2493.88" dur="3.45">as it relates to the dossier and</text>
  <text start="2495.86" dur="2.94">Christopher Steele&amp;#39;s credibility and</text>
  <text start="2497.33" dur="3.03">John Radcliffe has been on this program</text>
  <text start="2498.8" dur="3.84">trey Gowdy has been on this program</text>
  <text start="2500.36" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;ve also seen certain documents that</text>
  <text start="2502.64" dur="4.59">seem to indicate the same here&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="2505.43" dur="3.78">trey Gowdy told us about certain</text>
  <text start="2507.23" dur="4.38">documents that we have not seen so far</text>
  <text start="2509.21" dur="7.34">but they will be released soon he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2511.61" dur="7.29">zeroed in on one such watch this the FBI</text>
  <text start="2516.55" dur="5.59">agents conversations with george</text>
  <text start="2518.9" dur="5.31">papadapolis is because when an FBI agent</text>
  <text start="2522.14" dur="4.71">sends in informants to someone they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2524.21" dur="4.08">looking at typically those conversations</text>
  <text start="2526.85" dur="5.13">are recorded right those people are</text>
  <text start="2528.29" dur="5.28">wired yeah I mean if the bureau&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2531.98" dur="3.03">send an informant and the informants</text>
  <text start="2533.57" dur="3.15">going to be wired and if the bureau is</text>
  <text start="2535.01" dur="5.67">monitoring telephone calls there&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2536.72" dur="5.7">be a transcript of that and some of us</text>
  <text start="2540.68" dur="3.69">have been fortunate enough to know</text>
  <text start="2542.42" dur="4.11">whether or not those transcripts exist</text>
  <text start="2544.37" dur="4.77">but they haven&amp;#39;t been made public and I</text>
  <text start="2546.53" dur="4.71">think one in particular is going it has</text>
  <text start="2549.14" dur="4.11">the potential to actually persuade</text>
  <text start="2551.24" dur="4.26">people very little on this Russia probe</text>
  <text start="2553.25" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;m afraid is gonna persuade people who</text>
  <text start="2555.5" dur="3.87">hate Trump or who love Trump but there</text>
  <text start="2557.54" dur="3.57">is some information in these transcripts</text>
  <text start="2559.37" dur="4.25">that I think has the potential to be a</text>
  <text start="2561.11" dur="5.13">game-changer if it&amp;#39;s ever made public</text>
  <text start="2563.62" dur="5.47">are we gonna see those transcripts next</text>
  <text start="2566.24" dur="6.24">week well I don&amp;#39;t know that we will but</text>
  <text start="2569.09" dur="4.86">I do agree with mr. Gowdy that what he</text>
  <text start="2572.48" dur="3.03">has been able to see and I want to</text>
  <text start="2573.95" dur="3.6">stress that I haven&amp;#39;t seen it that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2575.51" dur="4.02">classified document and I&amp;#39;ve tried to</text>
  <text start="2577.55" dur="4.29">put the pieces of the puzzle together</text>
  <text start="2579.53" dur="4.47">without that but what he&amp;#39;s referring to</text>
  <text start="2581.84" dur="4.38">is actually transfer</text>
  <text start="2584" dur="3.81">I believe of George papadopolis that</text>
  <text start="2586.22" dur="4.65">would show that he was innocent and yet</text>
  <text start="2587.81" dur="5.6">we somehow have convicted and indicted</text>
  <text start="2590.87" dur="3.72">him as being this guilty Russian</text>
  <text start="2593.41" dur="2.29">cleaners</text>
  <text start="2594.59" dur="2.64">stay right there I want to talk just</text>
  <text start="2595.7" dur="4.77">about that when we come right back stay</text>
  <text start="2597.23" dur="5.01">with us welcome back and we are back</text>
  <text start="2600.47" dur="3.78">with house freedom caucus chairman mark</text>
  <text start="2602.24" dur="4.2">meadows and mr. chairman you just said a</text>
  <text start="2604.25" dur="4.56">minute ago that one of the documents</text>
  <text start="2606.44" dur="4.59">that we that trey Gowdy perhaps was</text>
  <text start="2608.81" dur="4.53">referring to was a document where George</text>
  <text start="2611.03" dur="6.39">papadopolis who was surveilled by the</text>
  <text start="2613.34" dur="6.18">FBI was talking with one of the Intel</text>
  <text start="2617.42" dur="5.03">sources and I think it&amp;#39;s an informant</text>
  <text start="2619.52" dur="7.32">that came out him and that was of course</text>
  <text start="2622.45" dur="7.03">halper in the UK yeah when we look at</text>
  <text start="2626.84" dur="5.36">all of this the fine work that actually</text>
  <text start="2629.48" dur="5.7">Devon Nunez John Ratcliffe Jim Jordan</text>
  <text start="2632.2" dur="5.98">Matt Gaetz and trey Gowdy have done on</text>
  <text start="2635.18" dur="5.85">this particular issue actually will only</text>
  <text start="2638.18" dur="5.07">be authenticated when we declassify some</text>
  <text start="2641.03" dur="5.07">of these documents in in if indeed there</text>
  <text start="2643.25" dur="4.44">are transcripts of George papadopolis</text>
  <text start="2646.1" dur="4.65">indicating that not only was he not</text>
  <text start="2647.69" dur="4.62">colluding with Russia but that indeed he</text>
  <text start="2650.75" dur="2.94">was being surveilled at the time you</text>
  <text start="2652.31" dur="5.61">know here&amp;#39;s the interesting thing Maria</text>
  <text start="2653.69" dur="6.24">we have mr. clapper John Brennan all of</text>
  <text start="2657.92" dur="4.47">them saying well we can&amp;#39;t get rid of</text>
  <text start="2659.93" dur="4.02">sources and methods and they&amp;#39;re right we</text>
  <text start="2662.39" dur="3.66">need to protect those but at the same</text>
  <text start="2663.95" dur="3.96">time they&amp;#39;re saying people weren&amp;#39;t spied</text>
  <text start="2666.05" dur="4.56">on well you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to protect</text>
  <text start="2667.91" dur="4.89">sources and methods if indeed Trump</text>
  <text start="2670.61" dur="4.83">Associates weren&amp;#39;t spied on by our</text>
  <text start="2672.8" dur="6.03">government and others and so I can think</text>
  <text start="2675.44" dur="5.37">as we start to put this forward what the</text>
  <text start="2678.83" dur="5.31">American people will hopefully see is</text>
  <text start="2680.81" dur="4.98">indeed a lot of bias on behalf of just a</text>
  <text start="2684.14" dur="3.48">few at the FBI well especially since</text>
  <text start="2685.79" dur="4.56">what we&amp;#39;re reading in the Muller report</text>
  <text start="2687.62" dur="4.56">are names like Killam Nick was supposed</text>
  <text start="2690.35" dur="3.6">to be a Russian a Russian source now we</text>
  <text start="2692.18" dur="4.41">find out that that was an agent of the</text>
  <text start="2693.95" dur="3.87">state department or Halper who has</text>
  <text start="2696.59" dur="4.23">worked at the State Department of the</text>
  <text start="2697.82" dur="5.72">FBI for years or Alexander Downer the</text>
  <text start="2700.82" dur="5.82">Australian all of these people</text>
  <text start="2703.54" dur="5.86">coincidentally not reached out to George</text>
  <text start="2706.64" dur="5.46">papadopolis as well as Carter Paige way</text>
  <text start="2709.4" dur="5.55">before the July 16th official</text>
  <text start="2712.1" dur="4.29">quote-unquote start of the investigation</text>
  <text start="2714.95" dur="1.879">into Donald Trump so here&amp;#39;s George</text>
  <text start="2716.39" dur="2.479">puppets</text>
  <text start="2716.829" dur="4.47">with me a couple of weeks ago when he</text>
  <text start="2718.869" dur="4.89">told the firm that he was working for he</text>
  <text start="2721.299" dur="4.44">wanted to go quit and work for the Trump</text>
  <text start="2723.759" dur="3.931">campaign they said wait before you quit</text>
  <text start="2725.739" dur="4.441">we want to send you to Rome so you could</text>
  <text start="2727.69" dur="5.639">meet this individual Joseph mislead and</text>
  <text start="2730.18" dur="5.25">mislead actually told him in secrecy</text>
  <text start="2733.329" dur="4.13">that the Russians had Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="2735.43" dur="3.149">emails so the question is was that</text>
  <text start="2737.459" dur="3.28">entrapment</text>
  <text start="2738.579" dur="5.91">was he an actual FBI source he&amp;#39;s george</text>
  <text start="2740.739" dur="6.03">papadapolis watch this so he tells you</text>
  <text start="2744.489" dur="5.52">Russia has emails of Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2746.769" dur="5.19">and this is the bomb that you feel was</text>
  <text start="2750.009" dur="6.72">the whole reason that they wanted you to</text>
  <text start="2751.959" dur="6.63">go to Rome to meet him because he they</text>
  <text start="2756.729" dur="3.421">wanted him to tell you about these</text>
  <text start="2758.589" dur="4.831">emails that Russia had of Hillary</text>
  <text start="2760.15" dur="5.099">Clinton is that right that&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="2763.42" dur="2.639">correct I think this person was some</text>
  <text start="2765.249" dur="3.21">sort of plans</text>
  <text start="2766.059" dur="4.831">he&amp;#39;s been outed recently living openly</text>
  <text start="2768.459" dur="4.5">next to the US Embassy in Rome</text>
  <text start="2770.89" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s been praised being protected</text>
  <text start="2772.959" dur="3.691">actually by Italian intelligence right</text>
  <text start="2774.64" dur="4.469">now and he&amp;#39;s done nursing for two years</text>
  <text start="2776.65" dur="4.619">you to go back and tell Trump about</text>
  <text start="2779.109" dur="6.331">Russia having Hillary Clinton emails did</text>
  <text start="2781.269" dur="7.5">you do that absolutely not that wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2785.44" dur="4.98">my job so all of these misconceptions</text>

  <text start="2805.449" dur="4.77">will we see accountability well it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2808.329" dur="3.78">number one question I get asked back</text>
  <text start="2810.219" dur="2.4">home in North Carolina and across the</text>
  <text start="2812.109" dur="2.49">country</text>
  <text start="2812.619" dur="3.84">will there be accountability and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2814.599" dur="5.49">here to tell you this morning the answer</text>
  <text start="2816.459" dur="5.88">is yes bill Barr is serious about making</text>
  <text start="2820.089" dur="4.95">sure that we reset and reestablish the</text>
  <text start="2822.339" dur="4.591">reputation of the FBI and the Department</text>
  <text start="2825.039" dur="4.41">of Justice and I can tell you that</text>
  <text start="2826.93" dur="4.74">unless someone actually goes to jail</text>
  <text start="2829.449" dur="4.35">most of the people will think that</text>
  <text start="2831.67" dur="4.559">accountability didn&amp;#39;t happen but I I</text>
  <text start="2833.799" dur="4.74">believe based on the documents I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="2836.229" dur="4.681">that crimes were committed and people</text>
  <text start="2838.539" dur="4.74">need to go to jail and what about the IG</text>
  <text start="2840.91" dur="4.26">report a word on that because we&amp;#39;ve all</text>
  <text start="2843.279" dur="3.201">been waiting for this a couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="2845.17" dur="3.29">ago you were</text>
  <text start="2846.48" dur="3.66">with me and you said to expect you</text>
  <text start="2848.46" dur="3.69">within the month now we&amp;#39;re being told</text>
  <text start="2850.14" dur="3.6">maybe it&amp;#39;s a little longer than that</text>
  <text start="2852.15" dur="4.38">what can you tell us Michael Horowitz</text>
  <text start="2853.74" dur="5.19">report you will only Michael Horowitz</text>
  <text start="2856.53" dur="4.05">knows the exact timeframe of when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2858.93" dur="3.9">coming out obviously the Attorney</text>
  <text start="2860.58" dur="4.83">General had indicated that he hoped to</text>
  <text start="2862.83" dur="4.76">see it in June I&amp;#39;m not as optimistic now</text>
  <text start="2865.41" dur="5.04">and one of the reasons for that is</text>
  <text start="2867.59" dur="5.44">additional information has been given to</text>
  <text start="2870.45" dur="4.44">the Inspector General for them to</text>
  <text start="2873.03" dur="4.02">investigate I would rather them get it</text>
  <text start="2874.89" dur="3.9">right then get it fast and I believe</text>
  <text start="2877.05" dur="4.23">their whole team is doing a very good</text>
  <text start="2878.79" dur="4.079">job and making sure that they hold those</text>
  <text start="2881.28" dur="3.18">people accountable like you just spoke</text>
  <text start="2882.869" dur="3.871">about so just to be clear we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2884.46" dur="4.11">gonna get the IG reports unlikely that</text>
  <text start="2886.74" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re gonna get the ID you put in June</text>
  <text start="2888.57" dur="4.14">what about you now that that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="2890.88" dur="3.84">opinion I can tell you inspector George</text>
  <text start="2892.71" dur="3.84">her wits you know obviously hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2894.72" dur="3.899">communicated that to my knowledge to</text>
  <text start="2896.55" dur="3.78">anybody on Capitol Hill but based on</text>
  <text start="2898.619" dur="3.601">what I&amp;#39;m seeing in terms of additional</text>
  <text start="2900.33" dur="4.289">information being shared with him I</text>
  <text start="2902.22" dur="4.44">think it&amp;#39;ll be a while okay so it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="2904.619" dur="4.651">a while because he&amp;#39;s gathering more</text>
  <text start="2906.66" dur="4.35">information and and and in terms of</text>
  <text start="2909.27" dur="3.15">Muller do you want him to come down and</text>
  <text start="2911.01" dur="3.57">testify you saw him in his press</text>
  <text start="2912.42" dur="4.46">conference last week he said I&amp;#39;m done</text>
  <text start="2914.58" dur="4.95">the report speaks for itself</text>
  <text start="2916.88" dur="4.39">well if the Democrats are smart they</text>
  <text start="2919.53" dur="3.78">will let him be done with it because I</text>
  <text start="2921.27" dur="4.53">can tell you Jim Jordan and I are very</text>
  <text start="2923.31" dur="5.1">prepared to ask a series of at least</text>
  <text start="2925.8" dur="5.16">eight different questions that would</text>
  <text start="2928.41" dur="5.37">indicate perhaps a lack of thoroughness</text>
  <text start="2930.96" dur="5.07">on behalf of Bob Muller and his team in</text>
  <text start="2933.78" dur="5.55">the Muller report so in other words why</text>
  <text start="2936.03" dur="8.19">did he have all democratic donors on his</text>
  <text start="2939.33" dur="7.44">team of reporters of investigators well</text>
  <text start="2944.22" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s not even just that I believe that</text>
  <text start="2946.77" dur="6.18">Andrew Weisman who was actually involved</text>
  <text start="2949.56" dur="5.64">in some of the early work at the FBI and</text>
  <text start="2952.95" dur="4.8">DOJ when they were first starting with</text>
  <text start="2955.2" dur="5.1">Peter struck and Bruce or in them you</text>
  <text start="2957.75" dur="5.07">know he came on I think his fingerprint</text>
  <text start="2960.3" dur="5.7">is all over this particular Muller</text>
  <text start="2962.82" dur="5.789">report and and from my perspective it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2966" dur="5.31">a one-sided report that doesn&amp;#39;t give the</text>
  <text start="2968.609" dur="4.711">privilege of a cross-examination so if</text>
  <text start="2971.31" dur="4.41">they come they need to be prepared to</text>
  <text start="2973.32" dur="4.289">cry be cross-examined with the facts</text>
  <text start="2975.72" dur="4.56">which would paint a very different</text>
  <text start="2977.609" dur="5.161">picture on behalf of this president</text>
  <text start="2980.28" dur="4.74">and give credence to why he has been so</text>
  <text start="2982.77" dur="3.93">upset with the ongoing investigation</text>
  <text start="2985.02" dur="4.05">he&amp;#39;s not gonna come unless he subpoenaed</text>
  <text start="2986.7" dur="4.53">is a subpoena in the cards well I think</text>
  <text start="2989.07" dur="3.99">it is according to chairman Nadler</text>
  <text start="2991.23" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re talking about potentially</text>
  <text start="2993.06" dur="4.98">issuing a subpoena to to Bob Muller I</text>
  <text start="2995.73" dur="4.05">think it would not be a prudent move on</text>
  <text start="2998.04" dur="4.26">his part but I&amp;#39;m all for transparency</text>
  <text start="2999.78" dur="4.71">let&amp;#39;s get everything out there and I</text>
  <text start="3002.3" dur="4.68">believe at the end of the day when</text>
  <text start="3004.49" dur="4.23">transparency happens a number of people</text>
  <text start="3006.98" dur="3.84">will start to understand that this</text>
  <text start="3008.72" dur="5.73">president was not only innocent but he</text>
  <text start="3010.82" dur="6.54">was right and being able to elevate this</text>
  <text start="3014.45" dur="5.16">to the the position he has been just an</text>
  <text start="3017.36" dur="3.42">extraordinary situation sir congressman</text>
  <text start="3019.61" dur="2.28">thanks very much for all the work you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3020.78" dur="1.53">doing and thanks for joining us this</text>
