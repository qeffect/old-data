  <text start="1949.999" dur="5.67">disgusting as the dossier let me say in</text>
  <text start="1953.389" dur="5.52">kind of - two tranches of what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1955.669" dur="6.181">looking for number one there&amp;#39;s what we</text>
  <text start="1958.909" dur="4.74">call information on Papadopoulos that we</text>
  <text start="1961.85" dur="3.809">believe is exculpatory that should have</text>

  <text start="1965.659" dur="3.84">aside on the FISA application remember</text>
  <text start="1968.509" dur="4.26">you have Comey</text>
  <text start="1969.499" dur="5.101">who has called this a mosaic so commis</text>
  <text start="1972.769" dur="4.681">mosaic he remember when we came out with</text>
  <text start="1974.6" dur="5.399">our memo that brought forward the fact</text>
  <text start="1977.45" dur="5.099">that they had used the Clinton paid-for</text>
  <text start="1979.999" dur="4.77">dossier the the dirt opposition research</text>
  <text start="1982.549" dur="3.51">and then they had leaked that to press</text>
  <text start="1984.769" dur="4.081">outlets and then they picked up those</text>
  <text start="1986.059" dur="5.37">press reports and used it in the FISA</text>
  <text start="1988.85" dur="3.72">application Comey said oh no as it was a</text>
  <text start="1991.429" dur="1.821">mosaic there was so much more</text>
  <text start="1992.57" dur="3.14">information</text>
  <text start="1993.25" dur="5.76">well there is more information there</text>
  <text start="1995.71" dur="6.66">that we think is equally as bad as using</text>
  <text start="1999.01" dur="6.39">opposition research let me ask you this</text>
  <text start="2002.37" dur="5.189">is it true let&amp;#39;s start with the first</text>
  <text start="2005.4" dur="7.56">Pfizer application that the bulk of</text>
  <text start="2007.559" dur="8.431">information was the steel dossier bought</text>
  <text start="2012.96" dur="5.37">and paid for by Hillary Clinton full of</text>
  <text start="2015.99" dur="6.03">Russian lies was that the bulk of the</text>
  <text start="2018.33" dur="6.63">FISA application yeah so it is the bulk</text>
  <text start="2022.02" dur="4.769">but remember what we believe the rest of</text>
  <text start="2024.96" dur="4.26">it is to fill that fills out commis</text>
  <text start="2026.789" dur="5.071">mosaic is actually the true definition</text>
  <text start="2029.22" dur="5.37">of the insurance policy so remember the</text>
  <text start="2031.86" dur="5.28">talk of the insurance policy by struck</text>
  <text start="2034.59" dur="4.62">and page on the text messages we believe</text>
  <text start="2037.14" dur="4.409">that insurance policy is not just about</text>
  <text start="2039.21" dur="4.05">investigating the Trump campaign we</text>
  <text start="2041.549" dur="5.61">believe it is to ensure that they were</text>

  <text start="2051.54" dur="4.5">rest of it is to fill that fills out</text>
  <text start="2053.399" dur="4.77">commis mosaic is actually the true</text>

  <text start="2069.389" dur="6">ensure that they were able to get the</text>
  <text start="2072.21" dur="4.919">the FISA warrant on Carter page so that</text>
  <text start="2075.389" dur="5.191">they go in and look at all the emails in</text>
  <text start="2077.129" dur="6.54">the campaign so the Carter page is being</text>
  <text start="2080.58" dur="5.88">used his Constitution it&amp;#39;s not a it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2083.669" dur="5.281">no small deal but they violated his</text>
  <text start="2086.46" dur="4.889">constitutional rights to get a backdoor</text>
  <text start="2088.95" dur="4.5">into all things Trump campaign that</text>
  <text start="2091.349" dur="4.111">would be the Trump transition and that</text>
  <text start="2093.45" dur="5.22">would be even the Trump presidency</text>
  <text start="2095.46" dur="5.67">correct sir it&amp;#39;s horrible what they have</text>
  <text start="2098.67" dur="4.65">done to many Americans but but let me</text>
  <text start="2101.13" dur="4.35">let me just say this about this shine so</text>
  <text start="2103.32" dur="5.779">this is we&amp;#39;ve been living for three</text>
  <text start="2105.48" dur="6.72">years with the perverted fantasies of</text>
  <text start="2109.099" dur="5.921">Glenn Simpson and the Clinton campaign</text>
  <text start="2112.2" dur="4.71">talking about P tapes and you know</text>
  <text start="2115.02" dur="3.66">supposedly you know reporters were all</text>
  <text start="2116.91" dur="4.26">over Europe looking for these P tapes</text>
  <text start="2118.68" dur="5.01">and this is really gross stuff and and</text>
  <text start="2121.17" dur="4.949">you showed that clip of Biden out on the</text>
  <text start="2123.69" dur="4.05">campaign trail when you have Americans</text>
  <text start="2126.119" dur="4.111">that are out there saying</text>
  <text start="2127.74" dur="4.349">I think that Vladimir is controlling</text>
  <text start="2130.23" dur="4.889">president Trump we can&amp;#39;t live for six</text>
  <text start="2132.089" dur="6.721">six more years of this those people have</text>
  <text start="2135.119" dur="7.591">been poisoned by these by this by just</text>
  <text start="2138.81" dur="6.029">the the the fantasies of Glenn Simpson</text>
  <text start="2142.71" dur="5.58">and the Clinton campaign so at some</text>
  <text start="2144.839" dur="6.901">point the FBI and the fusion this fusion</text>
  <text start="2148.29" dur="5.43">network they intertwined okay and they</text>
  <text start="2151.74" dur="4.2">were working in conjunction together on</text>
  <text start="2153.72" dur="3.629">this and I think that&amp;#39;s what the US</text>
  <text start="2155.94" dur="4.32">Attorney Durham is supposed to get to</text>
  <text start="2157.349" dur="4.801">the bottom of we know from the State</text>
  <text start="2160.26" dur="4.62">Department official Cadillac that and</text>
  <text start="2162.15" dur="5.25">she rightly warned everybody that this</text>
  <text start="2164.88" dur="4.29">was political because he had a he had a</text>
  <text start="2167.4" dur="4.32">due date he needed us out before</text>
  <text start="2169.17" dur="5.06">Election Day sounded desperate but</text>
  <text start="2171.72" dur="6.119">doesn&amp;#39;t that render that document</text>
  <text start="2174.23" dur="6.46">unverifiable if he won&amp;#39;t stand by it and</text>
  <text start="2177.839" dur="6.331">he&amp;#39;s not and I don&amp;#39;t know if any of its</text>
  <text start="2180.69" dur="4.74">true 50/50 raw intelligence so and</text>
  <text start="2184.17" dur="3.27">there&amp;#39;s a that sign defies a--</text>
  <text start="2185.43" dur="3.81">application was signing on or something</text>
  <text start="2187.44" dur="4.35">that they couldn&amp;#39;t possibly have</text>
  <text start="2189.24" dur="4.05">verified correct there&amp;#39;s a whole lot of</text>
  <text start="2191.79" dur="3.24">things that don&amp;#39;t make sense about this</text>
  <text start="2193.29" dur="3.87">but one thing that we do know now for</text>
  <text start="2195.03" dur="5.61">sure because of this this revelation is</text>
  <text start="2197.16" dur="5.699">is that the FBI did in fact know that</text>
  <text start="2200.64" dur="3.87">that christopher still was talking to</text>
  <text start="2202.859" dur="3.541">people within the State Department they</text>
  <text start="2204.51" dur="3.329">knew that at least one big part of it</text>
  <text start="2206.4" dur="3.449">because it&amp;#39;s supposedly that money was</text>
  <text start="2207.839" dur="4.801">being funneled through this Russian</text>
  <text start="2209.849" dur="5.551">consulate in Miami which doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="2212.64" dur="5.34">exist so the FBI knew knew good and well</text>
  <text start="2215.4" dur="4.02">that still had a lot of problems and all</text>
  <text start="2217.98" dur="2.91">and I&amp;#39;ll say something else about the</text>
  <text start="2219.42" dur="3.48">about about steal so you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2220.89" dur="4.26">called the steal dossier it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2222.9" dur="4.56">just Clinton opposition research I think</text>
  <text start="2225.15" dur="4.65">once we get to the bottom of this what</text>
  <text start="2227.46" dur="5.399">we&amp;#39;re gonna find is is that Steele had a</text>
  <text start="2229.8" dur="4.83">very small role and actually crafting</text>
  <text start="2232.859" dur="4.171">this and I&amp;#39;ll go back to what I started</text>
  <text start="2234.63" dur="5.04">with these really were the perverted</text>
  <text start="2237.03" dur="5.069">fantasies of Glenn Simpson working with</text>
  <text start="2239.67" dur="5.01">the Clinton campaign to say what can we</text>
  <text start="2242.099" dur="4.381">draw up here that we can spread out lies</text>
  <text start="2244.68" dur="4.47">to the American people that we can feed</text>
  <text start="2246.48" dur="4.26">into the FBI and lo and behold let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="2249.15" dur="3.75">an investigation going on the Trump</text>
  <text start="2250.74" dur="5.55">campaign that&amp;#39;s really what happened</text>
  <text start="2252.9" dur="6.39">here and the people behind that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2256.29" dur="4.89">building those FISA applications had to</text>
  <text start="2259.29" dur="4.019">have known the problems with steel</text>
  <text start="2261.18" dur="3.96">okay and now we know we actually have</text>
  <text start="2263.309" dur="3.901">now evidence right we have a smoking gun</text>
  <text start="2265.14" dur="4.56">because we have emails now according to</text>
  <text start="2267.21" dur="5.22">John Solomon&amp;#39;s report when you when you</text>
  <text start="2269.7" dur="4.95">move past that for sure by the second</text>
  <text start="2272.43" dur="4.649">third and fourth renewal of this FISA I</text>
  <text start="2274.65" dur="3.209">mean that is a totally project one they</text>
  <text start="2277.079" dur="2.79">were warned twice</text>
  <text start="2277.859" dur="3.331">Bruce or vandamm and the State</text>
  <text start="2279.869" dur="2.881">Department official warned them but</text>
  <text start="2281.19" dur="3.599">believe me they knew in the first one</text>
  <text start="2282.75" dur="3.68">yes but it&amp;#39;s but what&amp;#39;s even worse is I</text>
  <text start="2284.789" dur="3.901">think more people become contaminated</text>
  <text start="2286.43" dur="3.76">when you look at the second third and</text>
  <text start="2288.69" dur="3.21">fourth this went on for the full year</text>
  <text start="2290.19" dur="4.29">imagine that as an American citizen out</text>
  <text start="2291.9" dur="4.379">there the government was listening to</text>
  <text start="2294.48" dur="2.25">your calls and reading your emails for a</text>
  <text start="2296.279" dur="3.661">year</text>
  <text start="2296.73" dur="5.099">scary stuff finality to everyone who</text>
  <text start="2299.94" dur="4.76">wants to know exactly what their</text>
  <text start="2301.829" dur="5.671">government did to a political campaign</text>
  <text start="2304.7" dur="4.419">that&amp;#39;s why we want this FISA out there I</text>
  <text start="2307.5" dur="3.9">always talked about this last FISA</text>
  <text start="2309.119" dur="4.531">because people will learn about the</text>
  <text start="2311.4" dur="4.949">insurance policy they&amp;#39;ll finally learn</text>
  <text start="2313.65" dur="4.59">the insurance policy that the bit struck</text>
  <text start="2316.349" dur="5.071">and what was the insurer I learn what it</text>
  <text start="2318.24" dur="6.629">is the Russian has negation so if you</text>
  <text start="2321.42" dur="6">were well I actually don&amp;#39;t think so I</text>
  <text start="2324.869" dur="4.71">think the insurance policy was a lot of</text>
  <text start="2327.42" dur="3.6">people thought that but what we believe</text>
  <text start="2329.579" dur="3.54">the insurance policy is is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2331.02" dur="4.019">remaining in the in the last file that</text>
  <text start="2333.119" dur="3.96">no one knows yet so it&amp;#39;s what James</text>
  <text start="2335.039" dur="4.8">Comey called a mosaic it&amp;#39;s the other</text>
  <text start="2337.079" dur="8.671">facts that they that they had to go</text>
  <text start="2339.839" dur="7.891">before the FISA Court no no this is the</text>
  <text start="2345.75" dur="3.72">same the the Carter page FISA so</text>
  <text start="2347.73" dur="3.98">remember when we when we came out and</text>
  <text start="2349.47" dur="5.46">said the bulk of the FISA was made up of</text>
  <text start="2351.71" dur="4.629">the phony dossier and the fake news and</text>
  <text start="2354.93" dur="3.419">then you had all of these people</text>
  <text start="2356.339" dur="4.23">scramble around and say no no there was</text>
  <text start="2358.349" dur="3.421">all this other information well we went</text>
  <text start="2360.569" dur="3.901">in and we began to look at other</text>
  <text start="2361.77" dur="5.279">information we found out that it too was</text>
  <text start="2364.47" dur="5.28">not only phony but I think also as</text>
  <text start="2367.049" dur="4.591">concerning if not more concerning than</text>
  <text start="2369.75" dur="6.2">the original information that was used</text>
  <text start="2371.64" dur="7.59">in the Christopher so he said it&amp;#39;s worse</text>
  <text start="2375.95" dur="5.829">than the fake phony dossier that was</text>
  <text start="2379.23" dur="5.67">that used fake news in a circular way to</text>
  <text start="2381.779" dur="5.401">prove it remember they leaked they use</text>
  <text start="2384.9" dur="4.77">the leaks and the FISA that happened in</text>
  <text start="2387.18" dur="3.96">FISA one two and three when they say</text>
  <text start="2389.67" dur="4.679">when they get to the third renewal which</text>
  <text start="2391.14" dur="5.28">was the fourth FISA application what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2394.349" dur="4.891">in</text>
  <text start="2396.42" dur="5.34">because Comey said oh no no it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2399.24" dur="4.68">mosaic of information and it&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="2401.76" dur="5.099">stuff besides to feel the the steel</text>
  <text start="2403.92" dur="4.98">dossier so they Nunez and his crew went</text>
  <text start="2406.859" dur="5.541">back and they digged and they did they</text>
  <text start="2408.9" dur="6.179">did some digging and they found out that</text>
  <text start="2412.4" dur="4.6">what&amp;#39;s in it which was redacted which is</text>
  <text start="2415.079" dur="3.301">what&amp;#39;s in those buckets of D Class C</text>
  <text start="2417" dur="3.21">this is what they&amp;#39;re this is what</text>
  <text start="2418.38" dur="5.459">they&amp;#39;re trying to get ahead of this guys</text>
  <text start="2420.21" dur="7.02">by that spy report okay this information</text>
  <text start="2423.839" dur="5.571">a regarding that spy is probably the</text>
  <text start="2427.23" dur="6.27">information they use which was also</text>
  <text start="2429.41" dur="6.76">Russian dirty Russian lies okay lies and</text>
  <text start="2433.5" dur="4.829">disinformation I think Russia kind of</text>
