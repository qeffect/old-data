  <text start="351.12" dur="3.049">weeks right</text>
  <text start="351.84" dur="7.11">what statements have been made regarding</text>
  <text start="354.169" dur="7.361">timing a lot a lot of statements think</text>
  <text start="358.95" dur="4.77">fast-tracking what statements have been</text>
  <text start="361.53" dur="4.29">made by chairman graham regarding senate</text>
  <text start="363.72" dur="4.77">FISA hearings and witnesses he wants to</text>
  <text start="365.82" dur="5.67">do it quick in and out get him done okay</text>
  <text start="368.49" dur="5.07">why is Pelosi holding the two articles</text>
  <text start="371.49" dur="5.4">of impeachment I have a live a couple</text>
  <text start="373.56" dur="7.859">things sauce on this one is the not so</text>
  <text start="376.89" dur="6.3">popular view that Nancy Pelosi is</text>
  <text start="381.419" dur="4.531">actually on Team Trump she&amp;#39;s playing a</text>
  <text start="383.19" dur="4.68">part she&amp;#39;s an actor okay it&amp;#39;s causing</text>
  <text start="385.95" dur="4.92">the demise of the Democratic Party it</text>
  <text start="387.87" dur="5.37">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense right the second is</text>
  <text start="390.87" dur="4.02">that he asks the question about the</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="4.26">Senate you know can they work on</text>
  <text start="394.89" dur="5.339">anything else you know to while this is</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="3.45">going on and that perhaps she is doing</text>
  <text start="400.229" dur="3.151">this so that</text>
  <text start="400.95" dur="5.64">like so in other words what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="403.38" dur="4.47">pushing for is her her reasoning is she</text>
  <text start="406.59" dur="5.19">wants to ensure that there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="407.85" dur="6.75">a fair trial in the Senate well the</text>
  <text start="411.78" dur="5.13">problem is that they Chuck Schumer wants</text>
  <text start="414.6" dur="6.57">to call certain people certain witnesses</text>
  <text start="416.91" dur="6.51">mo mike mo kini mo kV and Pompeyo and</text>
  <text start="421.17" dur="5.64">Bolton and the was you know sick people</text>
  <text start="423.42" dur="5.97">like that okay and they tried this in</text>
  <text start="426.81" dur="4.32">this in their own investigation so that</text>
  <text start="429.39" dur="4.05">so the House of Representatives does the</text>
  <text start="431.13" dur="5.82">investigation the Senate holds the trial</text>
  <text start="433.44" dur="7.2">it&amp;#39;s like very similar to a grand jury</text>
  <text start="436.95" dur="6.24">investigation and then indictment and</text>
  <text start="440.64" dur="4.56">then going to a real trial okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.19" dur="4.29">kind of the whole process when it</text>
  <text start="445.2" dur="5.85">mirrors only the rules are different so</text>
  <text start="447.48" dur="5.01">if she holds these articles of</text>
  <text start="451.05" dur="4.41">impeachment and doesn&amp;#39;t take them over</text>
  <text start="452.49" dur="4.92">to the Senate because they want to call</text>
  <text start="455.46" dur="3.96">certain witnesses that they should have</text>
  <text start="457.41" dur="4.77">called when they were investigating it</text>
  <text start="459.42" dur="4.74">in the house the reason that it was like</text>
  <text start="462.18" dur="4.02">oh it&amp;#39;s the matter of national security</text>
  <text start="464.16" dur="3.78">Trump&amp;#39;s gonna bring the whole country</text>
  <text start="466.2" dur="4.05">down it we got our ariari when it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="467.94" dur="3.57">wait till after Christmas well when they</text>
  <text start="470.25" dur="3.09">realized that president Trump would</text>
  <text start="471.51" dur="7.71">claim his constitutional right to</text>
  <text start="473.34" dur="7.05">executive privilege that made them know</text>
  <text start="479.22" dur="2.82">that they would have to take him to</text>
  <text start="480.39" dur="4.8">court over this and it could get tied up</text>
  <text start="482.04" dur="4.62">they don&amp;#39;t want the house tied up so now</text>
  <text start="485.19" dur="2.85">they&amp;#39;re saying Chuck Schumer&amp;#39;s like oh</text>
  <text start="486.66" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re on our witnesses we want a fair</text>
  <text start="488.04" dur="4.52">trial we want due process and we want to</text>
  <text start="490.26" dur="6.06">call these witnesses and and basically</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="5.5">Mitch McConnell is saying well yes</text>
  <text start="496.32" dur="3.63">should have called open when you had the</text>
  <text start="498.06" dur="3.69">chance because we&amp;#39;re not gonna basically</text>
  <text start="499.95" dur="4.08">Senate Mitch McConnell&amp;#39;s not gonna allow</text>
  <text start="501.75" dur="3.93">the Senate to be hijacked while they</text>
  <text start="504.03" dur="3.9">decide to call these witnesses he</text>
  <text start="505.68" dur="4.14">inserts his executive privilege and then</text>
  <text start="507.93" dur="3.87">it goes to court through the Senate and</text>
  <text start="509.82" dur="4.38">the Senate cannot work on anything else</text>
  <text start="511.8" dur="4.679">while this is going on ties up judge</text>
  <text start="514.2" dur="4.17">appointments it ties up you know</text>
  <text start="516.479" dur="3.961">anything major the president wants to</text>
  <text start="518.37" dur="3.6">get done can&amp;#39;t get done so what Mitch</text>
  <text start="520.44" dur="3.42">McConnell is saying we&amp;#39;re not gonna do</text>
  <text start="521.97" dur="4.14">your investigation for you if you want</text>
  <text start="523.86" dur="4.65">to call these witnesses then you go open</text>
  <text start="526.11" dur="4.95">you take back take out the vote for the</text>
  <text start="528.51" dur="4.77">impeachment reopen your own grand jury</text>
  <text start="531.06" dur="2.7">type investigation and you call your own</text>
  <text start="533.28" dur="3.09">witness</text>
  <text start="533.76" dur="4.17">and then they&amp;#39;ll go to court and you can</text>
  <text start="536.37" dur="3.69">tie up the house and not the Senate</text>
  <text start="537.93" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on so I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.06" dur="6.95">the realistic look of it but the fact</text>
