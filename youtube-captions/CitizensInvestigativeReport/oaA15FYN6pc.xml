  <text start="10.32" dur="4.68">and I hope you&amp;#39;ll forgive I have a few</text>
  <text start="12.36" dur="7.05">notes so if it looks like I&amp;#39;m looking at</text>
  <text start="15" dur="7.739">notes I am why do I believe in the</text>
  <text start="19.41" dur="6.09">movement known as Q well because I first</text>
  <text start="22.739" dur="5.281">believed in the reality between good and</text>
  <text start="25.5" dur="5.369">evil that has plagued humanity since the</text>
  <text start="28.02" dur="5.52">very beginning now my faith informs and</text>
  <text start="30.869" dur="5.551">confirms the reality of that battle but</text>
  <text start="33.54" dur="5.04">even if you&amp;#39;re not a person of faith all</text>
  <text start="36.42" dur="5.25">you have to do is look around you and</text>
  <text start="38.58" dur="6.21">see that that battle is indeed raging</text>
  <text start="41.67" dur="6.78">and although I have been aware of that</text>
  <text start="44.79" dur="6.36">reality for decades it was taken the</text>
  <text start="48.45" dur="5.129">time to objectively look into the</text>
  <text start="51.15" dur="5.73">incredible deception that is the</text>
  <text start="53.579" dur="5.011">official account of 9/11 that really</text>
  <text start="56.88" dur="3.33">woke me up to the deaths of the</text>
  <text start="58.59" dur="4.95">depravity and the corruption that</text>
  <text start="60.21" dur="4.83">pervades our country in the world and</text>
  <text start="63.54" dur="4.109">once I understood the utter</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="6.27">impossibility of the official account</text>
  <text start="67.649" dur="6.391">being true and faced a realization that</text>
  <text start="71.31" dur="6.72">I and a majority of Americans have been</text>
  <text start="74.04" dur="6.18">purposely deceived in so many ways it</text>
  <text start="78.03" dur="5.79">became crystal clear to me that I could</text>
  <text start="80.22" dur="6.15">no longer accept what the so called</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="4.71">authorities or the mainstream media had</text>
  <text start="86.37" dur="6.75">to say because they just because they</text>
  <text start="88.53" dur="6.96">say it newsflash they lie I learned that</text>
  <text start="93.12" dur="5.52">the media was completely willing and</text>
  <text start="95.49" dur="5.76">capable of being fully complicit in</text>
  <text start="98.64" dur="6.659">pulling the wool over the eyes of the</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="7.35">American people I observed that the very</text>
  <text start="105.299" dur="7.68">top levels of our leadership our</text>
  <text start="108.6" dur="7.29">so-called leadership both Republican and</text>
  <text start="112.979" dur="5.851">Democrat were capable of looking right</text>
  <text start="115.89" dur="7.019">into that camera and outright lying to</text>
  <text start="118.83" dur="7.02">us why do we need cue because we need</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="6.66">someone we can trust to tell us the</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="7.41">truth I also learned that there is a</text>
  <text start="129.569" dur="5.37">cost to sincerely seeking the truth this</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="3.1">is particularly true if you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="134.939" dur="3.971">self-identified</text>
  <text start="136.36" dur="5.21">Rolle who wants to objectively seek</text>
  <text start="138.91" dur="6.95">truth outside of the echo chamber</text>
  <text start="141.57" dur="8.07">however it also happens to conservatives</text>
  <text start="145.86" dur="7.33">entering in to the 9/11 truth movement I</text>
  <text start="149.64" dur="6.19">personally saw how sincere people who</text>
  <text start="153.19" dur="5.28">were only seeking truthful answers to</text>
  <text start="155.83" dur="4.98">legitimate questions were ridiculed and</text>
  <text start="158.47" dur="4.65">worse and don&amp;#39;t even get me started</text>
  <text start="160.81" dur="4.95">about what happens to someone who</text>
  <text start="163.12" dur="7.01">sincerely and objectively dares to</text>
  <text start="165.76" dur="9.05">broach the questions such as abortion or</text>
  <text start="170.13" dur="7.93">transgenderism or heaven forbid our</text>
  <text start="174.81" dur="6.429">black brothers and sisters who dared</text>
  <text start="178.06" dur="6.42">across the line in support a</text>
  <text start="181.239" dur="6.031">conservative perspective or for that</text>
  <text start="184.48" dur="5.58">matter what happens to a president who</text>
  <text start="187.27" dur="6.81">finally has the courage to call out the</text>
  <text start="190.06" dur="8.34">media for their decades-old incredible</text>
  <text start="194.08" dur="7.86">bias in their reporting I&amp;#39;m using the</text>
  <text start="198.4" dur="6.66">9/11 deception as an example which has</text>
  <text start="201.94" dur="6.06">extremely valid correlations to current</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="5.28">day deceptive narratives that are being</text>
  <text start="208" dur="7.049">foisted upon the American people about</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="7.679">cue and about President Trump like many</text>
  <text start="215.049" dur="6.121">Americans I was simply too busy and too</text>
  <text start="218.019" dur="6.091">lazy to challenge the narrative that was</text>
  <text start="221.17" dur="5.76">being spoon-fed to me by our politicians</text>
  <text start="224.11" dur="6.81">the mainstream median the Hollywood</text>
  <text start="226.93" dur="6.96">elite however once I made the time to do</text>
  <text start="230.92" dur="5.52">the research what I have learned has</text>
  <text start="233.89" dur="6.21">truly been the most eye-opening and</text>
  <text start="236.44" dur="7.109">freeing experience of my life outside of</text>
  <text start="240.1" dur="6">my relationship with my creator so many</text>
  <text start="243.549" dur="4.861">questions started falling into place and</text>
  <text start="246.1" dur="6.69">the answers to those questions started</text>
  <text start="248.41" dur="7.38">falling into place at the point of my</text>
  <text start="252.79" dur="5.12">awakening I was no longer a slave to</text>
  <text start="255.79" dur="4.919">political correctness and I am</text>
  <text start="257.91" dur="6.509">unapologetic about my lack of respect</text>
  <text start="260.709" dur="7.201">for people who hold to the political</text>
  <text start="264.419" dur="5.291">correct crowd I have found that most</text>
  <text start="267.91" dur="3.99">people who align themselves</text>
  <text start="269.71" dur="5.52">with the left in particular have a</text>
  <text start="271.9" dur="6.39">miserable time explaining or defending</text>
  <text start="275.23" dur="5.1">their positions very few liberals can</text>
  <text start="278.29" dur="4.77">carry on a thoughtful and rational</text>
  <text start="280.33" dur="6.09">debate without devoting into some kind</text>
  <text start="283.06" dur="7.44">of name-calling or emotionally charged</text>
  <text start="286.42" dur="7.38">rant or they simply pull a Scarlett</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="7.59">O&amp;#39;Hara and say diddly deee and walk away</text>
  <text start="293.8" dur="6.48">when the questions get too tough outside</text>
  <text start="298.09" dur="5.72">of their echo chamber they really are</text>
  <text start="300.28" dur="6.51">very weak and shallow and inseparably</text>
  <text start="303.81" dur="6.64">self-righteous it&amp;#39;s wonderful to see</text>
  <text start="306.79" dur="6.24">that just because one has been sucked</text>
  <text start="310.45" dur="4.83">into the liberal cesspool doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="6.33">they have to stay there and I encourage</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="8.31">everyone to check out the great hashtag</text>
  <text start="319.36" dur="8.37">walkaway movement videos because they</text>
  <text start="323.59" dur="7.05">have rallied on their politicians or</text>
  <text start="327.73" dur="6.66">relied rather on their politicians the</text>
  <text start="330.64" dur="6.99">complicit leftist views entertainment</text>
  <text start="334.39" dur="6.45">and social media and the celebrity crowd</text>
  <text start="337.63" dur="5.49">to dictate their positions to them they</text>
  <text start="340.84" dur="5.19">are too lazy to check out things for</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="4.86">themselves and why should they most of</text>
  <text start="346.03" dur="4.74">the people they hang with and their</text>
  <text start="347.98" dur="5.88">college professors hold the same views</text>
  <text start="350.77" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s much easier to just fall in line</text>
  <text start="353.86" dur="5.34">and pay no attention to that man behind</text>
  <text start="356.11" dur="6.75">the curtain that&amp;#39;s what I love about the</text>
  <text start="359.2" dur="7.11">Q &amp;amp; R movement Q doesn&amp;#39;t tell us what to</text>
  <text start="362.86" dur="7.8">think they challenge us to think and do</text>
  <text start="366.31" dur="7.17">some of our own research if you are not</text>
  <text start="370.66" dur="4.62">already one of us I challenge you to</text>
  <text start="373.48" dur="5.67">challenge yourself to take an objective</text>
  <text start="375.28" dur="6.87">look at the Q movement and compare what</text>
  <text start="379.15" dur="4.62">you find to what you are being fed by</text>
  <text start="382.15" dur="5.79">your politicians and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="383.77" dur="7.26">media get to get started ask yourself</text>
  <text start="387.94" dur="6.48">some of these things where exactly did</text>
  <text start="391.03" dur="5.31">President Trump come from the President</text>
  <text start="394.42" dur="4.68">of the United States never ran before</text>
  <text start="396.34" dur="6.149">for a political office not even dog</text>

  <text start="402.489" dur="7.69">successful businessmen with an</text>
  <text start="404.539" dur="8.31">incredible the gifted wife and family he</text>
  <text start="410.179" dur="6.51">didn&amp;#39;t want for much in terms of comfort</text>
  <text start="412.849" dur="6.99">or fulfilling lifestyle do you really</text>
  <text start="416.689" dur="5.671">believe that he would sacrifice all that</text>
  <text start="419.839" dur="6.63">to get into the middle of the cesspool</text>
  <text start="422.36" dur="7.019">that is American politics just for the</text>
  <text start="426.469" dur="6">fun of it or for ego gratification come</text>

  <text start="432.469" dur="6.78">the brainwashing the media has attempted</text>
  <text start="434.779" dur="8.581">to effect on you really now what is is</text>
  <text start="439.249" dur="6.99">it what is it that Donald Trump has done</text>
  <text start="443.36" dur="6.75">to earn such hatred and vitriol from the</text>
  <text start="446.239" dur="6.93">left that they spent so much time and</text>
  <text start="450.11" dur="5.159">energy to express try to resist the</text>
  <text start="453.169" dur="6.84">temptation to say that he brought this</text>
  <text start="455.269" dur="7.14">animus on upon himself they hated him</text>
  <text start="460.009" dur="5.46">from the minute he captured the</text>
  <text start="462.409" dur="8.13">Republican nomination after all how dare</text>

  <text start="470.539" dur="6.81">challenged their precious princess of</text>
  <text start="473.089" dur="6.99">Darkness Hillary Clinton he has been one</text>
  <text start="477.349" dur="5.49">of the few leaders in a very long time</text>
  <text start="480.079" dur="4.86">with the courage to express the</text>
  <text start="482.839" dur="5.16">righteous indignation that the</text>
  <text start="484.939" dur="7.05">mainstream media so richly has deserved</text>
  <text start="487.999" dur="6.68">for years just ask yourself and remember</text>
  <text start="491.989" dur="7.17">you&amp;#39;re doing your best to be objective</text>
  <text start="494.679" dur="6.371">if even after eight years Obama would</text>
  <text start="499.159" dur="4.11">have accomplished even half of what</text>
  <text start="501.05" dur="4.919">President Trump has accomplished in a</text>
  <text start="503.269" dur="4.5">year and a half what do you think the</text>
  <text start="505.969" dur="4.56">media and the rest of the chattering</text>
  <text start="507.769" dur="4.83">classes would be saying they would</text>
  <text start="510.529" dur="4.62">likely be pushing for an amendment to</text>
  <text start="512.599" dur="5.16">the Constitution extending the number of</text>
  <text start="515.149" dur="5.01">terms the president can survive that can</text>
  <text start="517.759" dur="5.3">serve hell they probably do away with</text>
  <text start="520.159" dur="6.12">elections altogether and crown him King</text>
  <text start="523.059" dur="5.921">you have to admit what President Trump</text>
  <text start="526.279" dur="5.43">has accomplished so far with not one</text>
  <text start="528.98" dur="5.43">ounce of help from the obstructionist in</text>
  <text start="531.709" dur="6.891">Congress or support</text>
  <text start="534.41" dur="7.71">at all just just a support of being</text>
  <text start="538.6" dur="6.79">even-handed from the feckless mainstream</text>
  <text start="542.12" dur="5.22">media is pretty impressive not to</text>
  <text start="545.39" dur="5.13">mention the distraction that this</text>
  <text start="547.34" dur="6.75">ridiculous witch-hunt known as the</text>
  <text start="550.52" dur="6.87">russian collusion case has been can you</text>
  <text start="554.09" dur="5.94">imagine what could be accomplished with</text>
  <text start="557.39" dur="4.77">an opposition party that cared more</text>
  <text start="560.03" dur="5.03">about doing well for the american people</text>
  <text start="562.16" dur="6.3">than trying to destroy president Trump</text>
  <text start="565.06" dur="6.55">why do i follow q because the</text>
  <text start="568.46" dur="5.49">information that q and his magnificent</text>
  <text start="571.61" dur="5.94">team of supporters are getting now is</text>
  <text start="573.95" dur="7.29">the roadmap for restoring america to the</text>
  <text start="577.55" dur="5.69">country that we can and should be it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="581.24" dur="5.78">not a conspiracy theory that our</text>
  <text start="583.24" dur="8.38">government has become almost irreparably</text>
  <text start="587.02" dur="7.71">corrupt it is fact if you can&amp;#39;t see that</text>
  <text start="591.62" dur="6.69">you simply have not done your homework</text>
  <text start="594.73" dur="6.88">to weed out this level of corruption</text>
  <text start="598.31" dur="7.17">that our country has become involved in</text>
  <text start="601.61" dur="6.33">is extremely difficult it&amp;#39;s like trying</text>
  <text start="605.48" dur="4.91">to rip fresh meat from a lion&amp;#39;s mouth</text>
  <text start="607.94" dur="5.91">that lion isn&amp;#39;t going to make it easy</text>
  <text start="610.39" dur="6.73">that&amp;#39;s why we need a well-conceived plan</text>

  <text start="617.12" dur="8.82">q communicates that plan to the real</text>
  <text start="620.78" dur="7.8">power in this country the people if you</text>
  <text start="625.94" dur="5.55">refuse to accept the narrative that the</text>
  <text start="628.58" dur="5.73">corrupt establishment is trying so very</text>
  <text start="631.49" dur="5.85">hard to sell you and instead make a</text>
