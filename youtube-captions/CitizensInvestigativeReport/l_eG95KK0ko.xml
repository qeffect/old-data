  <text start="70.67" dur="4.5">yet but I&amp;#39;m looking do you know of any</text>
  <text start="73.64" dur="3.39">evidence that she may have used</text>
  <text start="75.17" dur="4.44">government resources to monitor</text>
  <text start="77.03" dur="5.16">communications of American citizens and</text>
  <text start="79.61" dur="7.2">you know of any of these citizens might</text>
  <text start="82.19" dur="6.75">have been journalists well what I can</text>
  <text start="86.81" dur="4.26">tell you is is that we know what what</text>

  <text start="93.68" dur="5.79">know that there are people within that</text>
  <text start="96.65" dur="4.32">were that were not only Ukrainians but</text>
  <text start="99.47" dur="3.149">also Americans that worked at the State</text>
  <text start="100.97" dur="3.54">Department who have raised concerns</text>
  <text start="102.619" dur="4.621">about this ambassador that&amp;#39;s why she was</text>
  <text start="104.51" dur="6.32">ultimately removed we also have concerns</text>
  <text start="107.24" dur="6.33">that possibly they were monitoring press</text>
  <text start="110.83" dur="5.469">from different journalists and others</text>
  <text start="113.57" dur="3.78">that we don&amp;#39;t know but you know we have</text>
  <text start="116.299" dur="3.061">people who are giving us this</text>
  <text start="117.35" dur="4.53">information and we&amp;#39;re gonna ask these</text>
  <text start="119.36" dur="4.799">questions to the State Department and</text>
  <text start="121.88" dur="4.14">hopefully they&amp;#39;ll get the answers before</text>
  <text start="124.159" dur="6.481">she comes in on Friday but we will give</text>
  <text start="126.02" dur="7.35">her an opportunity to shows up okay</text>
  <text start="130.64" dur="5.22">because now what you&amp;#39;re saying is very</text>
  <text start="133.37" dur="4.92">alarming to me I have three people now</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="4.65">that have told me that they believe</text>
  <text start="138.29" dur="3.63">there is evidence that shows government</text>
  <text start="140.51" dur="4.89">resources were used to monitor</text>
  <text start="141.92" dur="5.55">communications in one case a journalist</text>
  <text start="145.4" dur="4.47">that is a regular on this program with</text>
  <text start="147.47" dur="4.46">the name John Solomon have you heard</text>
  <text start="149.87" dur="5.28">that congressman</text>
  <text start="151.93" dur="4.449">well what I&amp;#39;ve heard and I want to be</text>
  <text start="155.15" dur="3.39">clear there&amp;#39;s that I think there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="156.379" dur="4.53">there&amp;#39;s a difference what I&amp;#39;ve heard is</text>
  <text start="158.54" dur="4.979">that there were strange requests</text>
  <text start="160.909" dur="5.25">irregular requests to monitor not just</text>
  <text start="163.519" dur="5.101">one journalist but multiple journalists</text>
  <text start="166.159" dur="4.621">now perhaps that was okay perhaps there</text>
  <text start="168.62" dur="4.979">was some reason for that that it can be</text>
  <text start="170.78" dur="4.2">explained away but that&amp;#39;s what we that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="173.599" dur="4.561">what we know and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
