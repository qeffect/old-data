  <text start="81.24" dur="4.11">suckered into wasting their time okay</text>
  <text start="83.299" dur="4.721">and it tells you just some things to</text>
  <text start="85.35" dur="5.55">look for especially the big one I want</text>
  <text start="88.02" dur="5.22">to point out right here is concern</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="3.75">trolling and copy I think it should say</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="5.01">it says pasta but it should say copy</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="6.27">paste spam shilling that contradicts</text>
  <text start="98.25" dur="6.299">confirmed findings okay so what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="5.64">finding and I&amp;#39;m not calling anybody out</text>
  <text start="104.549" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s just that it&amp;#39;s ignorance I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="3.48">think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="4.291">willful ignorance it&amp;#39;s just the fact</text>
  <text start="110.04" dur="5.399">that some people don&amp;#39;t really realize</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="4.47">this is going on and so sometimes you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="115.439" dur="3.57">getting read answers from a nons that</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="3">people want to you know focus on they</text>
  <text start="119.009" dur="6.451">sound really good but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re not real and so this</text>
  <text start="125.46" dur="5.49">is how misinformation is getting out and</text>
  <text start="127.02" dur="5.67">this is also to knock down the concern</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="2.32">that a lot of you have been leaving in</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="2.92">my comment</text>
  <text start="133.27" dur="4.83">that we shouldn&amp;#39;t be directing people to</text>
  <text start="135.61" dur="6.54">8chan yes I should they have numerous</text>
  <text start="138.1" dur="6.12">posts for new people they try to help</text>
  <text start="142.15" dur="4.2">new people as far as like how to lurk</text>
  <text start="144.22" dur="4.38">and not necessarily don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="146.35" dur="3.63">comment what they don&amp;#39;t want is people</text>
  <text start="148.6" dur="2.97">going over to 8chan and posting</text>
  <text start="149.98" dur="3.69">questions because they don&amp;#39;t have time</text>
  <text start="151.57" dur="3.9">with things are starting to move fast</text>
  <text start="153.67" dur="4.38">now and they want to be able to research</text>
  <text start="155.47" dur="4.94">and you just need to look through all</text>
  <text start="158.05" dur="4.95">the resources to get your answers and</text>
  <text start="160.41" dur="5.14">make sure that people who are telling</text>
  <text start="163" dur="4.05">you stuff are showing you the right</text>
  <text start="165.55" dur="3.72">stuff and how they&amp;#39;re getting there okay</text>
  <text start="167.05" dur="3.72">that they&amp;#39;re not just telling you you</text>
  <text start="169.27" dur="4.95">have to actually see it for yourself</text>
  <text start="170.77" dur="5.55">okay that doesn&amp;#39;t mean we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="174.22" dur="3.66">reference things or or but I&amp;#39;ll always</text>
  <text start="176.32" dur="3.96">tell you you know that it&amp;#39;s where to</text>
  <text start="177.88" dur="4.17">find it okay so I just want you to be</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="5.31">aware the biggest thing they do is</text>
  <text start="182.05" dur="6.42">contradict confirmed findings they&amp;#39;ll go</text>
  <text start="185.59" dur="4.86">over and say oh this you know Hugh said</text>
  <text start="188.47" dur="5.27">blah blah blah when actually it wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="190.45" dur="5.7">non that set it but was never a</text>
  <text start="193.74" dur="4.33">confirmed finding by queue and they</text>
  <text start="196.15" dur="4.53">ain&amp;#39;t on team over there so you just</text>
  <text start="198.07" dur="5.01">have to be and - how do you know when</text>
  <text start="200.68" dur="4.38">something is confirmed when an a non</text>
  <text start="203.08" dur="6">pose this is just an example this is one</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="5.22">from today on a non post and Q comes</text>

  <text start="210.28" dur="5.37">okay this is a this is a very good</text>
  <text start="212.86" dur="5.67">example of sometimes what he does where</text>
  <text start="215.65" dur="4.8">it will say you know say something and</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="4.2">then he comes back and simply puts the</text>
  <text start="220.45" dur="4.59">number five six to eight eight three</text>
