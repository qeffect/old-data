  <text start="690.39" dur="5.3">but listen to what he says about Rey and</text>
  <text start="693.09" dur="4.83">then listen to what he says about</text>
  <text start="695.69" dur="5.26">Rosenstein at the very end okay</text>

  <text start="733.26" dur="3.39">people need to go to jail for what they</text>
  <text start="734.91" dur="4.11">did because the FBI and the Department</text>

  <text start="739.02" dur="5.09">hands they defrauded the FISA Court they</text>

  <text start="816.87" dur="4.649">I thought they were powerful and they</text>
  <text start="818.61" dur="5.659">added clarity to his report he also was</text>
  <text start="821.519" dur="4.891">working within a bubble both both</text>
  <text start="824.269" dur="5.38">prosecutor Durham and the Attorney</text>
  <text start="826.41" dur="5.91">General bar their comments I do not</text>
  <text start="829.649" dur="4.38">believe senator would be made but for</text>
  <text start="832.32" dur="4.199">knowledge that they have that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="834.029" dur="5.041">have that this is far deeper and more</text>

  <text start="841.86" dur="4.08">Britain and other places where do you</text>
  <text start="843.81" dur="4.019">imagine this ends up because I can&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="845.94" dur="4.019">this ending up any other way but people</text>
  <text start="847.829" dur="3.601">being indicted and going to jail well</text>
  <text start="849.959" dur="2.581">all I can tell you is that Durham is</text>
  <text start="851.43" dur="2.969">looking at whether or not there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="852.54" dur="5.01">criminality here we know that Klein</text>
  <text start="854.399" dur="6.331">Smith the FBI lawyer in charge of the</text>
  <text start="857.55" dur="6.599">Pfizer process altered it email from the</text>
  <text start="860.73" dur="6.39">CIA saying that basically Carter Page</text>
  <text start="864.149" dur="4.921">was a source he altered the email to say</text>
  <text start="867.12" dur="3.779">he was not and that was a very big deal</text>
  <text start="869.07" dur="3.63">I don&amp;#39;t know what Durham&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="870.899" dur="4.471">eventually do but based on his statement</text>
  <text start="872.7" dur="4.11">Monday I would be worried if I were a</text>
  <text start="875.37" dur="3.48">lot of the people who involved in</text>
  <text start="876.81" dur="4.41">crossfire hurricane if you&amp;#39;re involved</text>
  <text start="878.85" dur="4.32">in crossfire hurricane your day of</text>
  <text start="881.22" dur="4.71">reckoning may be coming I trust Durham</text>
  <text start="883.17" dur="5.13">but as to Horowitz what did we learn</text>
  <text start="885.93" dur="4.62">today you can have a newspaper article</text>
  <text start="888.3" dur="4.289">and that can be the basis to open up a</text>
  <text start="890.55" dur="4.47">counterintelligence investigation the</text>
  <text start="892.589" dur="4.591">standard is incredibly low but we also</text>
  <text start="895.02" dur="4.41">learn from mr. Horowitz once this</text>
  <text start="897.18" dur="4.83">investigation was opened it became a</text>
  <text start="899.43" dur="4.59">criminal enterprise and conspiracy to</text>
  <text start="902.01" dur="4.26">defraud the FISA Court to trample on the</text>
  <text start="904.02" dur="4.59">rights of quarter-page and to basically</text>
  <text start="906.27" dur="3.48">illegally surveil Donald Trump the</text>
  <text start="908.61" dur="3.75">reason they never briefed President</text>
  <text start="909.75" dur="4.949">Trump defensively about the threats</text>
  <text start="912.36" dur="4.74">coming from Russia is they did not want</text>
  <text start="914.699" dur="4.861">to protect Trump they wanted to destroy</text>
  <text start="917.1" dur="5.19">Trump from the day he got elected until</text>
  <text start="919.56" dur="5.219">this thing was over the people in charge</text>
  <text start="922.29" dur="4.62">at the highest levels were out to get</text>
  <text start="924.779" dur="2.521">this guy to protect us from President</text>
  <text start="926.91" dur="2.16">Trump</text>
  <text start="927.3" dur="3.42">they didn&amp;#39;t believe he was legitimate</text>
  <text start="929.07" dur="4.079">and they were doing everything they</text>
  <text start="930.72" dur="3.7">could at every opportunity to keep it</text>
  <text start="933.149" dur="4.781">going to try to</text>
  <text start="934.42" dur="5.64">and finally they sent an FBI agent in an</text>
  <text start="937.93" dur="4.62">interview that was supposed to be an</text>
  <text start="940.06" dur="4.709">intelligence interview and intelligence</text>
  <text start="942.55" dur="4.92">assessment and intelligence briefing and</text>
  <text start="944.769" dur="6.12">the FBI agent there was there to</text>
  <text start="947.47" dur="4.799">basically spy on general Flynn and the</text>
  <text start="950.889" dur="3.45">president that should scare everybody</text>
  <text start="952.269" dur="4.38">the way he set up general Flynn meeting</text>
  <text start="954.339" dur="4.381">Comey was despicable repulsive over a</text>
  <text start="956.649" dur="4.261">33-year veteran and bragging about it I</text>
  <text start="958.72" dur="4.049">will say this we end up losing FISA as a</text>
  <text start="960.91" dur="3.929">result of this we will be less safe and</text>
  <text start="962.769" dur="4.081">when you man Devin Nunez say the same</text>
  <text start="964.839" dur="4.021">thing that concerns me in the safety of</text>
  <text start="966.85" dur="4.859">this country great job senator I know</text>

  <text start="995.74" dur="5.37">the bulk of my emails lately have been</text>
  <text start="997.899" dur="4.921">about Ray so I&amp;#39;m going to do a little</text>
  <text start="1001.11" dur="4.979">deep dive through the Q post on</text>

  <text start="1012.18" dur="4.349">what I&amp;#39;ve been seeing either and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1014.85" dur="3.929">two ways we can go on that but</text>
  <text start="1016.529" dur="4.411">Christopher Ray says in this interview</text>
  <text start="1018.779" dur="6.9">which I&amp;#39;m not going to play with ABC</text>
  <text start="1020.94" dur="6.78">okay I&amp;#39;ll just mute it here he just he</text>
  <text start="1025.679" dur="5.28">goes on to say that there&amp;#39;s no evidence</text>
  <text start="1027.72" dur="4.89">of a witch-hunt and that you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1030.959" dur="6.331">an affront to all the men and women in</text>
  <text start="1032.61" dur="6.809">the in the FBI to call what a deep state</text>
  <text start="1037.29" dur="3.629">existing I mean it&amp;#39;s just ridiculous</text>

  <text start="1040.919" dur="4.14">me sick but I will leave it in the notes</text>
  <text start="1042.72" dur="4.38">so you can see the interview so he says</text>
  <text start="1045.059" dur="4.201">the agency had not unfairly targeted</text>
  <text start="1047.1" dur="3.66">President Donald Trump&amp;#39;s campaign but he</text>
  <text start="1049.26" dur="3.33">acknowledged that mistakes had been made</text>
  <text start="1050.76" dur="4.289">and that he&amp;#39;s made over 400 corrective</text>
  <text start="1052.59" dur="5.64">actions to take care of that right so</text>
