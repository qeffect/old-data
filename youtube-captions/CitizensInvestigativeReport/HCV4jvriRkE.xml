  <text start="234.209" dur="5.371">marks the fourth robust piece of</text>
  <text start="237.299" dur="3.991">bipartisan legislation and it is</text>
  <text start="239.58" dur="3.379">bipartisan I have to tell you the</text>
  <text start="241.29" dur="5.39">Democrats have been great</text>
  <text start="242.959" dur="5.551">that I&amp;#39;ve signed in just the last few</text>
  <text start="246.68" dur="4.05">weeks we have a couple of others here</text>
  <text start="248.51" dur="4.53">that are already signed having to do</text>
  <text start="250.73" dur="6.84">with the same situation a little</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="6.06">different but all related and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="257.57" dur="3.33">over the last couple of weeks that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="259.1" dur="3.45">signed this it&amp;#39;s been a very strong</text>
  <text start="260.9" dur="4.53">priority but it&amp;#39;s not easy getting</text>
  <text start="262.55" dur="4.14">everyone together but this was Chris I</text>
  <text start="265.43" dur="4.92">would say about as easy as it gets</text>
  <text start="266.69" dur="5.819">because this is a problem that there is</text>
  <text start="270.35" dur="4.23">no definition of the other side there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="272.509" dur="3.961">only one son so I want to thank</text>
  <text start="274.58" dur="4.8">Democrats for helping us out with this</text>
  <text start="276.47" dur="4.85">one but still much work remains we</text>
  <text start="279.38" dur="4.379">cannot defeat the Menace of</text>
  <text start="281.32" dur="6.159">international human trafficking if we do</text>
  <text start="283.759" dur="4.891">not secure our border they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="287.479" dur="2.94">them through the border that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re coming from in this part of the</text>
  <text start="290.419" dur="3.961">world all over the world but in this</text>
  <text start="293.12" dur="2.7">part of the world they&amp;#39;re bringing them</text>
  <text start="294.38" dur="2.909">through the border they&amp;#39;re driving in</text>
  <text start="295.82" dur="3">and they&amp;#39;re not going through</text>
  <text start="297.289" dur="3.091">checkpoints because you can&amp;#39;t have four</text>
  <text start="298.82" dur="3.689">or five people sitting in the back of a</text>
  <text start="300.38" dur="4.92">car with tape over your mouth and your</text>
  <text start="302.509" dur="5.481">hands tied and go through somebody</text>
  <text start="305.3" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s checking out your car or your van</text>
  <text start="307.99" dur="5.38">unsecured borders allow traffickers</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="5.85">clear passage to transport their victims</text>
  <text start="313.37" dur="6.03">and into the United States is very easy</text>
  <text start="316.28" dur="4.71">to come all you do is drive 20 miles one</text>
  <text start="319.4" dur="3.66">way the other and you&amp;#39;ll find an open</text>
  <text start="320.99" dur="4.23">spot where there&amp;#39;s no protection and</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="5.31">then you go hundreds of miles where</text>
  <text start="325.22" dur="7.169">you&amp;#39;ll see pure open spots in fiscal</text>
  <text start="328.37" dur="6.81">year 2018 ice made more than 1,500 human</text>

  <text start="385.749" dur="4.35">offenses wherever we encounter them and</text>
  <text start="387.969" dur="5.611">we will bring justice to the victims of</text>

  <text start="401.949" dur="4.74">porous and unsecured southern border we</text>
  <text start="405.009" dur="5.3">need to be able to control those who are</text>
  <text start="406.689" dur="6.74">entering and leaving our country and a</text>
  <text start="410.309" dur="5.41">southern border that is not secured</text>
  <text start="413.429" dur="5.26">exacerbates the incidents of human</text>
  <text start="415.719" dur="4.92">trafficking there is a broad bipartisan</text>
  <text start="418.689" dur="3.18">support as we see here today to end</text>
  <text start="420.639" dur="3.95">human trafficking</text>
  <text start="421.869" dur="6.69">there should be broad bipartisan support</text>
  <text start="424.589" dur="5.8">to secure the southern border so that we</text>
  <text start="428.559" dur="4.56">can more effectively combat human</text>
  <text start="430.389" dur="4.95">trafficking we need a secure southern</text>

  <text start="506.28" dur="4.71">very much Aaron rich also because rich</text>
  <text start="508.77" dur="4.199">has done an incredible job of not only</text>
  <text start="510.99" dur="5.88">prosecution but other things that are</text>
  <text start="512.969" dur="5.25">coming up and maybe it&amp;#39;s a new work you</text>
  <text start="516.87" dur="3.089">know we have a tremendous team in</text>
  <text start="518.219" dur="3.271">Brooklyn and across the Eastern District</text>
  <text start="519.959" dur="3.721">of New York but every day we go to work</text>
  <text start="521.49" dur="3.06">we see the results of having a border</text>
  <text start="523.68" dur="2.79">that&amp;#39;s not secure</text>
  <text start="524.55" dur="3.15">whether it&amp;#39;s ms-13 drug trafficking or</text>
  <text start="526.47" dur="3.78">human trafficking that we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="527.7" dur="3.81">about today our folks get up every day</text>
  <text start="530.25" dur="3.54">work with our law enforcement partners</text>
  <text start="531.51" dur="4.47">diligently and protect the victims to</text>
  <text start="533.79" dur="3.66">protect our country but the reality is</text>
  <text start="535.98" dur="3.33">as long as we have a board that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="537.45" dur="4.74">secure we guard we&amp;#39;re going to suffer</text>
  <text start="539.31" dur="5.37">the consequences of that and so stepping</text>
  <text start="542.19" dur="4.8">forward we think that it would be a</text>
  <text start="544.68" dur="3.99">tremendous advantage to us in law</text>
  <text start="546.99" dur="3.45">enforcement in New York and across the</text>
  <text start="548.67" dur="3.33">country to have a border that&amp;#39;s secured</text>
  <text start="550.44" dur="2.43">us that we can protect our people and</text>
  <text start="552" dur="4.589">protect our country</text>
  <text start="552.87" dur="6.6">thank you Jeff thank you the fact is</text>
  <text start="556.589" dur="4.771">that if we don&amp;#39;t have barriers walls</text>
  <text start="559.47" dur="4.92">call them what you want but if we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="561.36" dur="6.95">have very strong barriers where people</text>
  <text start="564.39" dur="6.03">can not any longer drive right across it</text>
  <text start="568.31" dur="3.55">unbelievable vehicles they make a lot of</text>
  <text start="570.42" dur="4.56">money they have the best vehicles you</text>
  <text start="571.86" dur="5.43">can buy them stronger bigger and faster</text>
  <text start="574.98" dur="5.43">vehicles that our Police happen then ice</text>
  <text start="577.29" dur="4.62">has and then Border Patrol has so</text>
  <text start="580.41" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re pretty good effect they have</text>
  <text start="581.91" dur="4.65">areas that they go to it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="583.41" dur="4.44">highway and we have to close them up and</text>
  <text start="586.56" dur="3.84">we don&amp;#39;t close them up you&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="587.85" dur="8.13">kidding yourself look we can all play</text>
  <text start="590.4" dur="7.71">games but a wall is a necessity all of</text>
  <text start="595.98" dur="4.049">the other things the sensors and the</text>
  <text start="598.11" dur="3.36">drones it&amp;#39;s all wonderful to have and it</text>
  <text start="600.029" dur="2.521">works well but only if you have the wall</text>
  <text start="601.47" dur="4.77">you don&amp;#39;t have the wall it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="602.55" dur="5.4">matter a drone isn&amp;#39;t stopping a thousand</text>
  <text start="606.24" dur="4.409">people from running through</text>
