  <text start="264.9" dur="5.1">be a vote yes or no for him in committee</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="3.51">and to the floor and the Democrats are</text>
  <text start="270" dur="3.39">going to scream and yell you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="271.53" dur="4.14">have all kinds of problems but the</text>
  <text start="273.39" dur="4.59">bottom line is very simple if Brett</text>

  <text start="277.98" dur="4.68">United States Supreme Court the</text>

  <text start="282.66" dur="5.01">base will stay home this is a test</text>
  <text start="285.36" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;ve already failed the test on the</text>
  <text start="287.67" dur="2.79">president</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;ve been remarkably incompetent</text>
  <text start="290.46" dur="4.82">about defending the president against</text>
  <text start="292.53" dur="6.21">what was obviously a criminal conspiracy</text>
  <text start="295.28" dur="6.34">to falsely accuse him of crimes both</text>
  <text start="298.74" dur="4.44">before during and after the campaign in</text>
  <text start="301.62" dur="4.17">light of the latest Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="303.18" dur="6">revelation it&amp;#39;s fairly obvious how</text>
  <text start="305.79" dur="6.57">incompetent by the way that said if they</text>
  <text start="309.18" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t confirm Kavanaugh it&amp;#39;s over they</text>
  <text start="312.36" dur="3.72">lose the Senate that&amp;#39;s what this is</text>
  <text start="314.55" dur="3.9">about it&amp;#39;s about getting him on the</text>
  <text start="316.08" dur="5.52">Supreme Court and keeping the Senate the</text>
  <text start="318.45" dur="4.83">base is furious with the management of</text>
  <text start="321.6" dur="4.08">the house in the Senate by the</text>
  <text start="323.28" dur="4.71">Republicans they are lucky they are all</text>
  <text start="325.68" dur="2.97">still standing and can get to their</text>
  <text start="327.99" dur="2.31">offices</text>
  <text start="328.65" dur="3.21">you mentioned the seeds of this Russia</text>
  <text start="330.3" dur="2.64">hon I want to ask you this Russian</text>
  <text start="331.86" dur="3.03">investigation I want to ask you about</text>
  <text start="332.94" dur="3.33">this declassification shift by the</text>
  <text start="334.89" dur="3.39">President of the United States in the</text>

  <text start="343.71" dur="4.14">all of the characters who were involved</text>
  <text start="345.66" dur="4.53">here and all of a sudden now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.85" dur="4.11">decided to reverse course a bit giving</text>
  <text start="350.19" dur="3.6">the inspector general some time to</text>
  <text start="351.96" dur="3.57">review that documentation what do you</text>
  <text start="353.79" dur="3.27">make of the shift by the president and</text>
  <text start="355.53" dur="2.82">you mentioned trey gowdy as a part of</text>
  <text start="357.06" dur="4.29">this I imagine that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons</text>

  <text start="361.35" dur="4.77">giving them rope to hang themselves</text>
  <text start="363.81" dur="5.12">the person who briefed him on the</text>
  <text start="366.12" dur="5.73">declassification included Rosen Stein</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="7.12">that was before the New York Times</text>
  <text start="371.85" dur="7.05">article it is safe to say the Jeff</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="4.65">Sessions has to fire Rosen Stein it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="378.9" dur="3.9">not the president&amp;#39;s job by the way this</text>
  <text start="380.7" dur="4.23">all relates to declassification so just</text>
  <text start="382.8" dur="4.38">bear with me okay there is a game being</text>
  <text start="384.93" dur="5.28">played right now it&amp;#39;s called survival</text>
  <text start="387.18" dur="4.989">and the question for Rosen Stein and</text>
  <text start="390.21" dur="3.429">declassification was</text>
  <text start="392.169" dur="3.15">we already know what&amp;#39;s in these</text>

  <text start="397.03" dur="2.789">that they want to protect their sources</text>
  <text start="398.469" dur="4.41">is nonsense</text>
  <text start="399.819" dur="5.37">that&amp;#39;s all Rosen Stein&amp;#39;s game to prevent</text>
  <text start="402.879" dur="4.171">disclosure because what has happened is</text>
  <text start="405.189" dur="3.78">we now know from the New York Times</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="4.709">article notwithstanding that it was</text>
  <text start="408.969" dur="5.88">printed to help rod Rosen Stein the</text>

  <text start="1577.53" dur="3.69">of the top investigators we now know</text>
  <text start="1578.91" dur="4.71">that from text messages this is really</text>
  <text start="1581.22" dur="4.08">an investigation in search of a crime so</text>
  <text start="1583.62" dur="3.39">we haven&amp;#39;t seen the scope memo the</text>

  <text start="1837.89" dur="4.59">short you know again and finalise it</text>
  <text start="1839.21" dur="4.77">with an explanation point why is it</text>
  <text start="1842.48" dur="3.36">possible that the Brits in the</text>
