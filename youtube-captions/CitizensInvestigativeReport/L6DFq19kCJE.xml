  <text start="9.99" dur="7.17">2:38 p.m. on the east coast for your</text>
  <text start="12.99" dur="6.18">October 22nd 2019 okay we&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="17.16" dur="5.879">off with chuck grassley &amp;#39;he&amp;#39;s twitter</text>
  <text start="19.17" dur="7.14">feed he says all of the delays all of</text>
  <text start="23.039" dur="5.25">the delays excuses why the Horowitz IG</text>
  <text start="26.31" dur="5.07">Pfizer report isn&amp;#39;t public yet after</text>
  <text start="28.289" dur="5.821">several months of anticipation of its</text>
  <text start="31.38" dur="5.22">issues leads me to the suspicion it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="34.11" dur="5.01">going to be deep six by the deep state</text>
  <text start="36.6" dur="3.869">and then all the you know people like</text>
  <text start="39.12" dur="4.17">well who put Lindsay in charge of</text>
  <text start="40.469" dur="5.491">judiciary I agree I agree with this</text>
  <text start="43.29" dur="7.23">person right here all right</text>
  <text start="45.96" dur="7.68">I just think Lindsey Graham is failing</text>
  <text start="50.52" dur="5.699">us okay in a big way he&amp;#39;s failing us</text>
  <text start="53.64" dur="4.469">unless there&amp;#39;s a reason that we will see</text>
  <text start="56.219" dur="4.5">later I&amp;#39;ll take that back but as far as</text>
  <text start="58.109" dur="5.731">I&amp;#39;m concerned Lindsey Graham should be</text>
  <text start="60.719" dur="5.94">countering what the House Republican or</text>
  <text start="63.84" dur="4.59">yeah the Republicans but that so first</text>
  <text start="66.659" dur="5.221">of all I got two issues that I want to</text>
  <text start="68.43" dur="6.479">talk about I want to talk about the</text>
  <text start="71.88" dur="7.529">failure of Lindsey Graham in my opinion</text>
  <text start="74.909" dur="5.971">to counteract the impeachment stuff he</text>
  <text start="79.409" dur="5.311">could be calling all these same people</text>
  <text start="80.88" dur="6.3">over to ed to testify in the judiciary</text>
  <text start="84.72" dur="3.689">okay that it&amp;#39;s only certain people can</text>
  <text start="87.18" dur="4.92">call things so that&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="88.409" dur="6.541">complicated thing but Lindsey Graham has</text>
  <text start="92.1" dur="6">the power to subpoena these feet same</text>
  <text start="94.95" dur="4.8">people that atom shift is doing he can</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="3.809">subpoena them as well and get it out and</text>
  <text start="99.75" dur="3.99">open okay sorry you guys have to do this</text>
  <text start="101.909" dur="3.811">twice but since they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="3.96">secretive over there we&amp;#39;re gonna call</text>
  <text start="105.72" dur="3.03">him over here in the judiciary in the</text>
  <text start="107.7" dur="2.849">Senate and we&amp;#39;re gonna get their</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="5.509">testimony he should be doing this</text>
  <text start="110.549" dur="6.261">especially since what is going on is so</text>
  <text start="114.259" dur="4.421">unconstitutional the judiciary is</text>
  <text start="116.81" dur="4.839">absolutely the place that should be</text>
  <text start="118.68" dur="4.5">being aired why is that not happening we</text>
  <text start="121.649" dur="5.97">need to be loud about this now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="123.18" dur="5.939">telling you it&amp;#39;s to me it&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="4.441">not digging it okay</text>
  <text start="129.119" dur="4.591">I think Lindsey Graham needs to decide</text>
  <text start="132.06" dur="3.36">what side he&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="133.71" dur="4.05">and stop playing this flip-flop I know</text>
  <text start="135.42" dur="4.77">Syria will expose him big time and</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="6.96">that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s so dead set against it</text>
  <text start="140.19" dur="6.69">but the point is all Syrian talk aside</text>
  <text start="144.72" dur="3.98">with Syria issue which I&amp;#39;ll get to at</text>
  <text start="146.88" dur="4.5">the end of this video</text>
  <text start="148.7" dur="4.33">Lindsey Graham needs to step it up all</text>
  <text start="151.38" dur="3.57">right and he needs to start calling</text>
  <text start="153.03" dur="4.71">these people who are giving closed-door</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="5.7">behind secret testimony sometimes atom</text>
  <text start="157.74" dur="4.71">shift isn&amp;#39;t even there okay so I&amp;#39;ll play</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="5.04">a couple videos to show you that but</text>
  <text start="162.45" dur="6.99">here&amp;#39;s the other thing the other thing</text>
  <text start="165.69" dur="5.67">is that there is a there is an element</text>
  <text start="169.44" dur="4.65">to the IG Pfizer report and there is</text>
  <text start="171.36" dur="5.13">reasons why it&amp;#39;s taking so long</text>
  <text start="174.09" dur="4.53">Durham has expanded his scope and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="176.49" dur="4.49">talked about that on previous videos so</text>
  <text start="178.62" dur="4.56">what I want to do today is go through</text>
  <text start="180.98" dur="4.39">something that was talked about in the</text>
  <text start="183.18" dur="6.78">New York Times right where Sundance on</text>
  <text start="185.37" dur="6.87">October 19th responded to it okay and he</text>
  <text start="189.96" dur="4.68">talks about the small group the DOJ</text>
  <text start="192.24" dur="4.53">small group promote defensive Spygate</text>
  <text start="194.64" dur="5.28">operations former FBI DOJ officials</text>
  <text start="196.77" dur="6.51">nervous hiring lawyers okay this is on</text>
  <text start="199.92" dur="5.37">October 19th now the main thing I want</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="4.8">to get to is not so much the alley</text>
  <text start="205.29" dur="5.1">Watkins thing but Durham&amp;#39;s trail leading</text>
  <text start="208.08" dur="5.76">to the Senate Select Committee on</text>
  <text start="210.39" dur="7.32">Intelligence okay this is what is being</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="5.67">expanded so there&amp;#39;s a reason why and I</text>
  <text start="217.71" dur="3.63">know Chuck Grassley probably knows this</text>
  <text start="219.51" dur="5.91">but he&amp;#39;s playing his part he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="6.54">get the base riled up and and and enough</text>
  <text start="225.42" dur="4.83">to start like demanding Senator Graham</text>
  <text start="227.88" dur="5.34">does something it&amp;#39;s ridiculous that</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="4.2">because remember you know chuck Grassley</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="3.09">was head of the Senate committee he</text>
  <text start="234.45" dur="3.81">would have been calling these people so</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="5.55">I think he&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s his way of sort of</text>
  <text start="238.26" dur="5.7">like like needling Lindsey Graham just a</text>
  <text start="241.86" dur="3.6">little bit because it&amp;#39;s like uh Lindsey</text>
  <text start="243.96" dur="3.42">what are you doing bro</text>
  <text start="245.46" dur="4.17">yeah you can do all the FISA stuff and</text>
  <text start="247.38" dur="4.71">call Inspector Horwitz inspector general</text>
  <text start="249.63" dur="4.59">Horowitz when once the FISA report comes</text>
  <text start="252.09" dur="4.709">out we get that but like where the hell</text>
  <text start="254.22" dur="6.63">are the Republicans standing up behind</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="6.301">this president - the freedom caucus</text>
  <text start="260.85" dur="4.039">besides those guys they&amp;#39;re like running</text>
  <text start="263.1" dur="5.27">for the hills and of</text>
  <text start="264.889" dur="5.791">you know hiding under the rug etc so</text>
  <text start="268.37" dur="5.609">he&amp;#39;s right and calling them out okay so</text>
  <text start="270.68" dur="6.359">before we start you may want to go back</text>
  <text start="273.979" dur="6.18">and look at my videos where I cover the</text>
  <text start="277.039" dur="8.541">james wolf ali watkins story where james</text>
  <text start="280.159" dur="5.421">wolf leaked the carter page</text>
  <text start="286.509" dur="6.22">Faiza when it came when it was delivered</text>
  <text start="289.49" dur="5.399">to the SSC I the Select Senate Committee</text>
  <text start="292.729" dur="5.791">on Intelligence that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s Adam</text>

  <text start="302.96" dur="5.79">day and and and how he basically got off</text>
  <text start="306.199" dur="8.611">with a slap on the wrist okay how can</text>
  <text start="308.75" dur="8.699">you leak a FISA under classification and</text>
  <text start="314.81" dur="4.469">you leaked it to Ali Watkins who then</text>
  <text start="317.449" dur="5.161">writes a story for BuzzFeed and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="319.279" dur="4.831">big part of what happened okay anyway</text>

  <text start="4207.9" dur="5.73">the FISA okay honor about March 17th</text>
  <text start="4211.11" dur="5.01">Wolfe exchanged 82 text messages with</text>

  <text start="4228.51" dur="6">male 1 honor about which is Carter page</text>
  <text start="4231.69" dur="4.95">ok so basically again and you can look</text>
  <text start="4234.51" dur="3.93">at the wolf indictment here you can tell</text>
  <text start="4236.64" dur="4.17">from the description within the</text>
  <text start="4238.44" dur="5.22">indictment the FBI and investigators are</text>
  <text start="4240.81" dur="4.83">describing the FISA application and then</text>
  <text start="4243.66" dur="3.33">it goes and and I like I said to love</text>
  <text start="4245.64" dur="2.64">you don&amp;#39;t know this whole story click</text>
  <text start="4246.99" dur="5.82">that I&amp;#39;m not gonna go through this whole</text>
  <text start="4248.28" dur="8.67">story but he leaks that wolf leaks the</text>
  <text start="4252.81" dur="6.45">classified information right - to Olly</text>
  <text start="4256.95" dur="5.43">Watkins all right so the logical reasons</text>
  <text start="4259.26" dur="4.71">for the Rosenstein DOJ not to charge</text>
  <text start="4262.38" dur="3.15">wolf because he was not charged he was</text>
  <text start="4263.97" dur="3.99">charged with one little stupid thing</text>
  <text start="4265.53" dur="4.26">okay he was charged with lying three</text>
  <text start="4267.96" dur="3.33">times to federal authorities and he pled</text>
  <text start="4269.79" dur="3.66">down to one count of lying to the FBI</text>
  <text start="4271.29" dur="4.41">why well you&amp;#39;re about to see he</text>
  <text start="4273.45" dur="4.2">threatened like Dix put expose all of</text>
  <text start="4275.7" dur="3.66">them and I don&amp;#39;t know if you go back and</text>
  <text start="4277.65" dur="3.39">watch my videos I go into in detail I</text>
  <text start="4279.36" dur="4.04">don&amp;#39;t want to carry this out - - it - a</text>
  <text start="4281.04" dur="4.59">three-hour video here okay</text>
  <text start="4283.4" dur="4.42">conservative tree house made the case in</text>
  <text start="4285.63" dur="3.66">mid 2018 so you can click there and</text>
  <text start="4287.82" dur="3.18">that&amp;#39;s if you don&amp;#39;t want to watch my</text>
  <text start="4289.29" dur="3.96">video but I will attach it to the bottom</text>
  <text start="4291" dur="2.64">the logical Rio case oh we did that</text>
  <text start="4293.25" dur="4.89">already</text>
  <text start="4293.64" dur="6.42">so the logical reason for him to not</text>
  <text start="4298.14" dur="4.29">charge wolf with FISA leak was because</text>
  <text start="4300.06" dur="5.22">that charge would ensnare powerful</text>
  <text start="4302.43" dur="6.12">senators on the powerful committee were</text>
  <text start="4305.28" dur="5.31">still in hindsight we now see that</text>
  <text start="4308.55" dur="5.34">committee was working to aid the</text>
  <text start="4310.59" dur="4.74">purposes intents of the correct DOJ FBI</text>
  <text start="4313.89" dur="2.79">officials as they built their</text>
  <text start="4315.33" dur="5.22">impeachment agenda</text>
  <text start="4316.68" dur="6.63">remember the Select Senate Committee on</text>
  <text start="4320.55" dur="7.08">Intelligence has intelligence oversight</text>

  <text start="5902.48" dur="3.659">there is nothing to worry about</text>
  <text start="5904.01" dur="3.54">what do you expect well I expect one is</text>
  <text start="5906.139" dur="3.691">that John Durham is part of an</text>
  <text start="5907.55" dur="3.96">exceptional cast of US attorneys that</text>
  <text start="5909.83" dur="4.17">this administration has put in place I</text>

  <text start="5914" dur="4.29">expanded not only in the timeline but</text>
  <text start="5916.429" dur="4.02">also his staff has increased and that</text>
  <text start="5918.29" dur="4.139">tells me really one thing and that is</text>
  <text start="5920.449" dur="3.841">they have found something that is gonna</text>
  <text start="5922.429" dur="3.81">take more time and attention than they</text>
  <text start="5924.29" dur="3.929">thought maybe more documents more</text>
  <text start="5926.239" dur="3.63">witnesses or just you know sort of a</text>
  <text start="5928.219" dur="3.781">bigger case and it originally been</text>
  <text start="5929.869" dur="4.77">expected so I think you know this Durham</text>
  <text start="5932" dur="3.75">investigation really they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="5934.639" dur="2.491">to talk about it they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="5935.75" dur="2.52">leak they&amp;#39;re just gonna do their work</text>
  <text start="5937.13" dur="2.94">and I think it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="5938.27" dur="3.36">interesting once we get a full report</text>
  <text start="5940.07" dur="4.08">because I know that bill Barr who is</text>
  <text start="5941.63" dur="5.25">also really working on this probe by all</text>
  <text start="5944.15" dur="4.17">by all accounts is determined to get to</text>
  <text start="5946.88" dur="4.02">the bottom of this as to how this</text>

  <text start="5957.83" dur="3">Attorney General and his involvement</text>
  <text start="5959.06" dur="6.31">this kind of thing this is a few days</text>
  <text start="5960.83" dur="7.39">ago let me ask you about</text>

  <text start="5968.22" dur="4.44">think where they&amp;#39;re going is a cover-up</text>
  <text start="5969.93" dur="5.58">of the cover-up and that&amp;#39;s really very</text>
  <text start="5972.66" dur="5.31">sad for them and that to have a Justice</text>

  <text start="5991.23" dur="4.68">questions need to be answered there was</text>
  <text start="5992.49" dur="5.58">a lot of unusual activities that appear</text>
  <text start="5995.91" dur="4.35">to need to be revealed and you know I</text>
  <text start="5998.07" dur="4.62">think it&amp;#39;s fascinating that Nancy Pelosi</text>
  <text start="6000.26" dur="4.5">somehow is really just running a</text>
  <text start="6002.69" dur="4.11">communications operation right now and</text>

  <text start="6010.01" dur="2.88">this is right now out of the house and</text>
  <text start="6011.45" dur="3.51">Nancy Pelosi is leading and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6012.89" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s really disciplining to call to say</text>
