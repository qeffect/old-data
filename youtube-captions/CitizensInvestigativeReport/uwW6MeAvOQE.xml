  <text start="133.86" dur="4.71">caucus chairman mark Meadows I gotta say</text>
  <text start="135.3" dur="5.58">this about mark Jim Jordan Devin Nunez</text>
  <text start="138.57" dur="4.11">will add Doug Collins to the mix and</text>
  <text start="140.88" dur="4.53">maybe Matt Gaetz the freshman he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="142.68" dur="4.05">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s overly ambitious but a good</text>
  <text start="145.41" dur="4.11">guy and he&amp;#39;s really done a great job</text>
  <text start="146.73" dur="4.44">without you guys behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="149.52" dur="3.3">because I&amp;#39;ve now we&amp;#39;ve now seen these</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="3.99">closed-door testimony without your</text>
  <text start="152.82" dur="4.68">efforts we would not be here and this</text>
  <text start="155.16" dur="4.23">would have got likely all have gotten up</text>
  <text start="157.5" dur="3.69">and gotten away with and Congressman</text>
  <text start="159.39" dur="4.19">Nunez especial applause to you tonight</text>
  <text start="161.19" dur="4.26">for that speech which I think probably</text>
  <text start="163.58" dur="3.37">you&amp;#39;re right up there with Lindsey</text>
  <text start="165.45" dur="3.75">Graham&amp;#39;s speech on the day of the</text>
  <text start="166.95" dur="4.23">Kavanagh Eric well thank you thank you</text>
  <text start="169.2" dur="2.97">Sean and what was amazing to me that I</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="3.36">think a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="172.17" dur="4.74">attention to is there were two retired</text>
  <text start="174.54" dur="4.56">FBI agents on the stand there on the</text>
  <text start="176.91" dur="4.35">witness stand along with Andy McCarthy</text>
  <text start="179.1" dur="4.65">who&amp;#39;s appears a lot on your show and</text>
  <text start="181.26" dur="4.949">others what I was amazed at is the the</text>
  <text start="183.75" dur="4.8">lack of concern by these former FBI</text>
  <text start="186.209" dur="4.681">agents one of whom Peters Strock used to</text>
  <text start="188.55" dur="3.659">work for and look they serve their</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="3.84">country and I&amp;#39;m sure they did a great</text>
  <text start="192.209" dur="4.341">job but when I brought up the fact that</text>
  <text start="194.73" dur="3.9">we probably shouldn&amp;#39;t be using</text>
  <text start="196.55" dur="4.499">counterintelligence capabilities in this</text>
  <text start="198.63" dur="4.77">country to target a political campaign</text>
  <text start="201.049" dur="4.181">they just sat there it was almost like</text>
  <text start="203.4" dur="4.44">they had been coached by the Democrats</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="4.289">to not say anything bad about the</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="3.81">counterintelligence investigation that</text>
  <text start="209.519" dur="3.631">occurred and I&amp;#39;ll tell you if that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="211.65" dur="3.45">attitude I know we always say oh this</text>
  <text start="213.15" dur="4.35">happened at the very top of the FBI but</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="3.87">I will tell you that&amp;#39;s if that attitude</text>
  <text start="217.5" dur="3.69">permeated throughout the</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="4.35">counterintelligence capabilities and if</text>
  <text start="221.19" dur="3.93">retired FBI agents think it&amp;#39;s okay to</text>
  <text start="223.32" dur="4.29">use counterintelligence against</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="4.14">political campaigns I think we have</text>
  <text start="227.61" dur="2.76">we&amp;#39;ve gone a long way in this country</text>
  <text start="229.26" dur="2.22">because they used to be the Democrats</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="2.55">who didn&amp;#39;t support the</text>
  <text start="231.48" dur="2.85">counterintelligence capabilities because</text>
  <text start="232.92" dur="3.69">they thought that they were spying on</text>
  <text start="234.33" dur="5.1">their campaigns and on political enemies</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="5.159">it ends up in fact they took them over</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="3.57">they corrupted the whole thing and it</text>
  <text start="241.769" dur="3.241">seems like that&amp;#39;s the attitude</text>
  <text start="243" dur="3.959">throughout the FBI at least for the</text>
  <text start="245.01" dur="4.53">former and former most of the former</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="4.471">officials really it was a powerful</text>
  <text start="249.54" dur="3.9">moving speech he gave today and I will</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="3.45">say this and I mean this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="253.44" dur="2.88">compliment to congressman meadows I</text>
  <text start="254.88" dur="2.82">don&amp;#39;t want everybody to understand as</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="3.12">the chairman of the freedom caucus what</text>
  <text start="257.7" dur="3.39">you and Jim Jordan in particular did</text>
  <text start="259.44" dur="3.81">behind closed doors now that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="261.09" dur="4.41">getting those transcripts you are asking</text>
  <text start="263.25" dur="3.34">the right questions the hardest</text>
  <text start="265.5" dur="3.73">questions</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="5.01">inform questions and forward-thinking</text>
  <text start="269.23" dur="5.76">questions knowing what the truth would</text>
  <text start="271.6" dur="6.06">eventually be and come out as your</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="4.86">reaction to all of these events well</text>
  <text start="277.66" dur="4.47">thank you Sean I can tell you Devon</text>
  <text start="279.85" dur="5.069">Nunez has done an unbelievable job and</text>
  <text start="282.13" dur="5.37">actually we&amp;#39;ve had two different camps</text>
  <text start="284.919" dur="4.861">he&amp;#39;s seen much of the classified Jim</text>
  <text start="287.5" dur="4.139">Jordan and I have not and so we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="289.78" dur="5.04">able to work together in a way that</text>
  <text start="291.639" dur="4.861">honestly is transparency for the</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="3.9">American people here&amp;#39;s the thing that</text>
  <text start="296.5" dur="6.03">that dawned on me today</text>
  <text start="298.72" dur="6.48">you had another Muller hearing here and</text>
  <text start="302.53" dur="4.77">in hip C an open hearing why was it open</text>
  <text start="305.2" dur="4.56">because they want to try to resurrect</text>
  <text start="307.3" dur="4.05">the whole mulher narrative and try to do</text>
  <text start="309.76" dur="3.84">their best to make sure that the</text>
  <text start="311.35" dur="4.05">American people are engaged but the</text>
  <text start="313.6" dur="3.78">truth of the matter is they didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="315.4" dur="4.29">the result they wanted you know there</text>
  <text start="317.38" dur="4.56">was the Oh Adam you know if at first you</text>
  <text start="319.69" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t succeed try try again well they</text>
  <text start="321.94" dur="4.71">tried tried tried and try it again and</text>
  <text start="324.37" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;ll continue to try but the problem</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="5.4">is is they know the truth many even some</text>
  <text start="330.4" dur="3.66">of the witnesses today here on Capitol</text>
  <text start="332.05" dur="3.78">Hill they&amp;#39;re supposed to be experts they</text>
  <text start="334.06" dur="5.04">hadn&amp;#39;t even read the steel dossier</text>
  <text start="335.83" dur="6">that&amp;#39;s how not credible that was that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.1" dur="4.56">pretty amazing too so how are we to</text>
  <text start="341.83" dur="4.62">interpret this New York Times news</text>
  <text start="343.66" dur="5.49">tonight it do both of you believe as I</text>
  <text start="346.45" dur="4.17">think I&amp;#39;m reading and interpreting I</text>
  <text start="349.15" dur="2.88">always asked both of you one question</text>
  <text start="350.62" dur="3.27">because neither one of you would leak to</text>
  <text start="352.03" dur="2.699">me the way I wanted you to I would ask</text>
  <text start="353.89" dur="3.029">you one question</text>
  <text start="354.729" dur="5.25">you&amp;#39;re laughing what&amp;#39;s the question am i</text>
  <text start="356.919" dur="5.461">over the target am i over the target in</text>
  <text start="359.979" dur="4.831">thinking countries like Italy ally</text>
  <text start="362.38" dur="4.98">countries and Great Britain and</text>
  <text start="364.81" dur="4.74">Australia maybe were out sourced</text>
  <text start="367.36" dur="3.95">intelligence a gathering by our</text>
  <text start="369.55" dur="5.25">intelligence people to circumvent</text>
  <text start="371.31" dur="5.35">American laws Devin Nunez so I think</text>
  <text start="374.8" dur="4.8">what we don&amp;#39;t know yet is we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="376.66" dur="4.379">who Joseph Mifsud was working for he</text>
  <text start="379.6" dur="3.78">could have been he&amp;#39;s been described as a</text>
  <text start="381.039" dur="4.531">Western intelligence asset he was in</text>
  <text start="383.38" dur="3.81">Italy so that for sure brings up he</text>
  <text start="385.57" dur="3.18">could be a part of the Italian</text>
  <text start="387.19" dur="3.539">government of some kind of asset there</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="5.039">he could be a British asset because he</text>
  <text start="390.729" dur="5.401">also lived in London so but there&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="393.789" dur="5.641">it could be possible quite frankly that</text>
  <text start="396.13" dur="4.5">he was working for fusion GPS or an</text>
  <text start="399.43" dur="3.66">operation like whew</text>
  <text start="400.63" dur="4.08">GPS through Christopher steel and what</text>
  <text start="403.09" dur="3.9">we what we still don&amp;#39;t know at the heart</text>
  <text start="404.71" dur="4.2">of this is where did the Clinton</text>
  <text start="406.99" dur="4.44">campaign dirty operation that was run by</text>
  <text start="408.91" dur="5.55">fusion GPS and the FBI they were on</text>
  <text start="411.43" dur="5.07">parallel tracks when did those merge and</text>
  <text start="414.46" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s really what I think myself and</text>
  <text start="416.5" dur="4.14">Mark Meadows are have been trying to</text>
  <text start="418.42" dur="3.72">figure out for a long time and hopefully</text>
  <text start="420.64" dur="2.52">that&amp;#39;s what the US Attorney out of</text>
  <text start="422.14" dur="2.82">Connecticut is going to get to the</text>
  <text start="423.16" dur="4.28">bottom of we have a right to know what</text>
  <text start="424.96" dur="5.1">countries were involved in this well</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="4.45">mark yeah Sean we&amp;#39;re getting a lot of</text>
  <text start="430.06" dur="3.39">whistleblowers primarily the</text>
  <text start="431.89" dur="3.39">whistleblowers are coming forward</text>
  <text start="433.45" dur="4.32">because they believe Attorney General</text>
  <text start="435.28" dur="3.96">Bill Barr and John Durham are willing to</text>
  <text start="437.77" dur="4.44">get to the bottom of it so people that</text>
  <text start="439.24" dur="5.52">perhaps were afraid under previous</text>
  <text start="442.21" dur="4.56">leadership to actually say well we knew</text>
  <text start="444.76" dur="3.75">this was wrong they&amp;#39;re coming forward</text>
  <text start="446.77" dur="3.36">now and you know when we look at</text>
  <text start="448.51" dur="3.57">intelligence we know that the</text>
  <text start="450.13" dur="4.8">intelligence community shares a lot of</text>
  <text start="452.08" dur="5.19">information what we also know what Devon</text>
  <text start="454.93" dur="4.05">unas knows Jim Jordan Mark meadows and</text>
  <text start="457.27" dur="4.05">others that have been involved is that</text>
  <text start="458.98" dur="5.91">the Steele dossier Christopher Steele</text>
  <text start="461.32" dur="6.51">his dossier not only doesn&amp;#39;t have its</text>
  <text start="464.89" dur="5.46">origins with fusion GPS and the Democrat</text>
  <text start="467.83" dur="4.17">National Committee but other other</text>
  <text start="470.35" dur="4.05">players that are connected Sidney</text>
  <text start="472" dur="4.47">Blumenthal and they were shopping it to</text>
  <text start="474.4" dur="4.71">every media outlet that they possibly</text>
  <text start="476.47" dur="4.86">could and the FBI knew it that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="479.11" dur="5.13">problem the FBI knew it prior to that</text>
  <text start="481.33" dur="5.3">first FISA and here here they are using</text>
  <text start="484.24" dur="4.32">it as credible information for a FISA</text>
  <text start="486.63" dur="4.18">application I just think that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="488.56" dur="6.15">totally wrong let me ask you about the</text>
  <text start="490.81" dur="7.14">same exit question most people are</text>
  <text start="494.71" dur="5.19">asking me when when are they gonna be</text>
  <text start="497.95" dur="5.01">held accountable what do you see in the</text>
  <text start="499.9" dur="4.29">future Devon newness and you know you</text>
  <text start="502.96" dur="3.45">know a lot more than I do</text>
  <text start="504.19" dur="3.81">where do you see that going and who</text>
  <text start="506.41" dur="2.82">would you not want to be tonight in</text>
  <text start="508" dur="3.05">terms of the playing your head down on</text>
  <text start="509.23" dur="4.14">one pillow for a peaceful night&amp;#39;s sleep</text>
  <text start="511.05" dur="4.63">well look if you&amp;#39;re any of the former</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="4.62">people at the FBI that were in in those</text>
  <text start="515.68" dur="3.799">famous text messages that marca did such</text>
  <text start="517.99" dur="3.63">a good job of getting to the bottom of</text>
  <text start="519.479" dur="4.69">those people I think all have to be</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="4.71">concerned if you look at any of the</text>
  <text start="524.169" dur="3.781">dirty operations arms of the Clinton</text>
  <text start="526.33" dur="3.39">campaign and there&amp;#39;s a lot of people</text>
  <text start="527.95" dur="3.69">that were both at the DOJ involved in</text>
  <text start="529.72" dur="3.93">that spouses of people of the DOJ that</text>
  <text start="531.64" dur="2.81">were involved because ultimately that</text>
  <text start="533.65" dur="2.89">still does</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="4.29">yay permeated down all the way through</text>
  <text start="536.54" dur="4.63">ultimately to the special counsel and</text>
  <text start="538.74" dur="3.96">I&amp;#39;ll disclose with this tonight that is</text>
  <text start="541.17" dur="3.18">that I was finally able to see the scope</text>
  <text start="542.7" dur="3.75">memo and remember I had these concerns</text>
  <text start="544.35" dur="3.99">that it was based upon the steel dossier</text>
  <text start="546.45" dur="3.3">and look I can&amp;#39;t talk about what those</text>
  <text start="548.34" dur="4.41">in there but we know from the Moller</text>
  <text start="549.75" dur="5.04">report or from the what Judge Sullivan</text>
  <text start="552.75" dur="4.95">put out we know that it was probably</text>

  <text start="1193.27" dur="5.52">in operation crossfire hurricane so I</text>
  <text start="1196.48" dur="5.18">went and then and then the FBI track</text>
  <text start="1198.79" dur="5.91">right we also have several other tracks</text>
  <text start="1201.66" dur="5.77">within these so - they have funneling</text>
  <text start="1204.7" dur="6.45">things to the FBI and later would be you</text>
  <text start="1207.43" dur="6.39">know it&amp;#39;s gonna be the State Department</text>
  <text start="1211.15" dur="5.22">but the FBI track was a domestic centric</text>
  <text start="1213.82" dur="4.83">albeit subcontracted to fusion GPS and</text>
  <text start="1216.37" dur="4.32">later to a former British intelligence</text>

  <text start="1231.97" dur="5.52">the FBI track continued with the Muller</text>

  <text start="1237.49" dur="4.02">this is we you know this is was uh this</text>
  <text start="1241.21" dur="2.67">was</text>
  <text start="1241.51" dur="4.08">a quote from Devon Nunez so it took us a</text>
  <text start="1243.88" dur="3.36">long time to actually get this what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1245.59" dur="3.78">called the electronic communication as</text>
  <text start="1247.24" dur="3.96">we know for now for your viewers what it</text>
  <text start="1249.37" dur="3.6">is the original intelligence original</text>
  <text start="1251.2" dur="3.93">reasons that the counterintelligence was</text>
  <text start="1252.97" dur="4.079">started now this was really important to</text>
  <text start="1255.13" dur="3.72">us because the counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="1257.049" dur="3.211">investigation uses tools of our</text>
  <text start="1258.85" dur="2.88">intelligence services that are not</text>
  <text start="1260.26" dur="4.11">supposed to be used on American citizens</text>
  <text start="1261.73" dur="4.68">and we&amp;#39;ve long wanted to know what</text>
  <text start="1264.37" dur="4.799">intelligence did you have that actually</text>
  <text start="1266.41" dur="5.31">led to this investigation so what we</text>
  <text start="1269.169" dur="4.951">found now after the investigators have</text>
  <text start="1271.72" dur="6.39">reviewed it is that in fact there was no</text>
  <text start="1274.12" dur="5.79">intelligence so we haven&amp;#39;t turned it not</text>
  <text start="1278.11" dur="3.87">there was no official intelligence so we</text>
  <text start="1279.91" dur="3.84">have a traditional partnership with</text>
  <text start="1281.98" dur="3.36">what&amp;#39;s called the five eyes agreement</text>
  <text start="1283.75" dur="3.059">five eyes agreement involves our friends</text>
  <text start="1285.34" dur="4.079">in Australia New Zealand the United</text>
  <text start="1286.809" dur="4.921">Kingdom Canada and of course us so</text>
  <text start="1289.419" dur="5.041">longtime processes and procedures in</text>
  <text start="1291.73" dur="4.56">place where we moved intelligence across</text>
  <text start="1294.46" dur="4.86">we were not supposed to spy on each</text>
  <text start="1296.29" dur="5.07">other citizens and it worked well and it</text>
  <text start="1299.32" dur="3.45">continues to work well and we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1301.36" dur="3.36">working well because there was no</text>
  <text start="1302.77" dur="3.96">intelligence that passed the five eyes</text>
  <text start="1304.72" dur="3.449">channels to our government and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1306.73" dur="3.72">why we had to see the original</text>
  <text start="1308.169" dur="4.411">communication so now we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1310.45" dur="4.29">figure out as you know we were</text>
  <text start="1312.58" dur="3.78">investigating the State Department we</text>
  <text start="1314.74" dur="3.78">think there&amp;#39;s some major irregularities</text>
  <text start="1316.36" dur="3.77">in the State Department oh boy are there</text>
  <text start="1318.52" dur="4.409">oh yeah</text>
  <text start="1320.13" dur="4.9">and we&amp;#39;re trying to figure out how this</text>
  <text start="1322.929" dur="4.38">information about mr. Papadopoulos of</text>
  <text start="1325.03" dur="4.35">all people who was supposedly meeting</text>
  <text start="1327.309" dur="4.291">with some folks in London how that made</text>
  <text start="1329.38" dur="5.549">it over across into the FBI hands and</text>
  <text start="1331.6" dur="4.68">the video is here okay the direct</text>
  <text start="1334.929" dur="3.061">evidence for what Devon Nunez is</text>
  <text start="1336.28" dur="4.41">describing is found in two specific</text>
  <text start="1337.99" dur="4.74">documents each document is unique to</text>
  <text start="1340.69" dur="4.68">their track one track is the CIA the</text>
  <text start="1342.73" dur="4.319">other track is the FBI the merging point</text>
  <text start="1345.37" dur="4.59">that binds them is the US State</text>
  <text start="1347.049" dur="6.241">Department first we review the CIA track</text>
  <text start="1349.96" dur="5.19">okay all right so they&amp;#39;re saying here</text>
  <text start="1353.29" dur="4.62">the evidence for the CIA track is found</text>
  <text start="1355.15" dur="5.37">in the Weissman Mueller report otherwise</text>
  <text start="1357.91" dur="5.1">known as the Mueller dossier okay so</text>
  <text start="1360.52" dur="5.58">there&amp;#39;s two dossiers more specifically</text>
  <text start="1363.01" dur="4.89">if found the if it is found in the</text>
  <text start="1366.1" dur="4.68">intentional way the report tries to</text>
  <text start="1367.9" dur="6.39">conflate two contact points this track</text>
  <text start="1370.78" dur="4.47">is CIA director John Brennan&amp;#39;s work with</text>
  <text start="1374.29" dur="3.03">the enlisted help</text>
  <text start="1375.25" dur="3.9">from the FBI counterintelligence unit</text>
  <text start="1377.32" dur="4.26">Peter struck him bill precept as they</text>
  <text start="1379.15" dur="4.83">travel to the UK in Rome hate to tell</text>
  <text start="1381.58" dur="5.94">you that but after Western intelligence</text>
  <text start="1383.98" dur="5.43">asset Josef Massoud posed as a Russian</text>
  <text start="1387.52" dur="3.9">plants a story on John George</text>
  <text start="1389.41" dur="4.08">papadopolis about Russia having Clinton</text>
  <text start="1391.42" dur="3.62">emails the operation that needs</text>
  <text start="1393.49" dur="4.08">Papadopoulos to share the information</text>
  <text start="1395.04" dur="4.96">that&amp;#39;s where a joint network comes in</text>
  <text start="1397.57" dur="4.95">the network is the US Embassy in London</text>
  <text start="1400" dur="4.46">the Australian Embassy in London the</text>
  <text start="1402.52" dur="4.8">Australian ambassador to the UK</text>

  <text start="1407.32" dur="5.64">Thompson notice on page 89 of the report</text>
  <text start="1410.59" dur="4.05">but read very carefully and specifically</text>
  <text start="1412.96" dur="3.17">to note the date Wiseman and Mueller</text>
  <text start="1414.64" dur="6.3">used to frame the Russia story</text>
  <text start="1416.13" dur="6.85">extraction from Papadopoulos so during</text>
  <text start="1420.94" dur="3.33">that meeting mister told Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="1422.98" dur="2.64">that he met with high-level Russian</text>
  <text start="1424.27" dur="4.68">government officials during his recent</text>
  <text start="1425.62" dur="4.83">trip to Moscow Massoud also said that on</text>
  <text start="1428.95" dur="3.68">the trip he learned the Russians had</text>
  <text start="1430.45" dur="4.5">dirt on candidate Hillary Clinton as</text>
  <text start="1432.63" dur="4.24">Papadopoulos later stated to the FBI</text>
  <text start="1434.95" dur="4.38">Mifsud said the dirt was in the form of</text>
  <text start="1436.87" dur="6.66">emails of Clinton and that they have</text>
  <text start="1439.33" dur="5.73">thousands of emails on May 6 2016 10</text>
  <text start="1443.53" dur="3.06">days after that meeting with mr.</text>
  <text start="1445.06" dur="3.96">Papadopoulos suggested to a</text>
  <text start="1446.59" dur="5.07">representative of a foreign government</text>
  <text start="1449.02" dur="4.32">that the Trump campaign had received</text>
  <text start="1451.66" dur="3.75">indications from Russian government that</text>
  <text start="1453.34" dur="3.78">it could assist the campaign through the</text>
  <text start="1455.41" dur="3.75">anonymous release of information that</text>
  <text start="1457.12" dur="3.75">would be damaging the hillary and then</text>
  <text start="1459.16" dur="3.42">we dropped down here the information</text>
  <text start="1460.87" dur="3.24">contained in the FBI case opening</text>
  <text start="1462.58" dur="4.77">related materials and then they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1464.11" dur="4.8">this crossed out the foreign government</text>
  <text start="1467.35" dur="4.56">conveyed this information to the US</text>
  <text start="1468.91" dur="5.37">government on july 26 2016 a few days</text>
  <text start="1471.91" dur="4.83">after WikiLeaks release of the Clinton</text>
  <text start="1474.28" dur="4.11">related emails the FBI opened at the</text>
  <text start="1476.74" dur="3.21">investigation of potential coordination</text>
  <text start="1478.39" dur="4.62">between Russian the Trump campaign a few</text>
  <text start="1479.95" dur="4.47">days later based on the information so</text>
  <text start="1483.01" dur="3.69">he&amp;#39;s saying the meeting on the 6th was</text>
  <text start="1484.42" dur="4.62">not a meeting with Australian ambassador</text>
  <text start="1486.7" dur="4.8">downer that meeting didn&amp;#39;t happen until</text>
  <text start="1489.04" dur="4.35">May 10th the recent release of documents</text>
  <text start="1491.5" dur="4.44">from Australia confirmed this timeline</text>
  <text start="1493.39" dur="4.86">the meeting on May 6 was between George</text>
  <text start="1495.94" dur="7.65">papadopolis and Downer&amp;#39;s aide Erica</text>
  <text start="1498.25" dur="9.48">Thompson so if the u.s. used the</text>
  <text start="1503.59" dur="5.7">information from May 6 meeting so</text>
  <text start="1507.73" dur="3">I&amp;#39;m sorry I skipped over the little</text>
  <text start="1509.29" dur="3.18">thing here it says that what they met</text>
  <text start="1510.73" dur="3.18">about was that the Trump campaign had</text>
  <text start="1512.47" dur="3.24">received information from Russian</text>
  <text start="1513.91" dur="3.3">government that it could assist the</text>
  <text start="1515.71" dur="3.09">campaign through the anonymous release</text>
  <text start="1517.21" dur="3.24">of information that would be damaging to</text>
  <text start="1518.8" dur="4.83">Hillary Clinton that came from Erika</text>
  <text start="1520.45" dur="5.63">Thompson so if you if the u.s. used the</text>
  <text start="1523.63" dur="6.15">information for May 6 2016 meeting as</text>
  <text start="1526.08" dur="5.65">conveyed on July 26 2016 it was the</text>
  <text start="1529.78" dur="3.9">conversation with Erika Thompson that</text>
  <text start="1531.73" dur="4.23">opened crossfire hurricane not the</text>
  <text start="1533.68" dur="4.95">meeting with downer on the 10th he could</text>
  <text start="1535.96" dur="5.06">go deeper here if you want to the subtle</text>
  <text start="1538.63" dur="4.74">but important distinction in contact and</text>
  <text start="1541.02" dur="5.44">communication reconciles the statement</text>
  <text start="1543.37" dur="5.52">by Devon Nunez because Thomson is also a</text>
  <text start="1546.46" dur="4.92">reported intelligence operative or spy</text>
  <text start="1548.89" dur="4.05">and information from her would not be</text>
  <text start="1551.38" dur="3.78">passing through five eyes official</text>
  <text start="1552.94" dur="4.38">channels however their intent for in</text>
  <text start="1555.16" dur="3.72">their intents and purposes the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1557.32" dur="3.87">operation needed to give the appearance</text>
  <text start="1558.88" dur="4.08">of official channels so the in for</text>
  <text start="1561.19" dur="4.71">inference between the claim and the</text>
  <text start="1562.96" dur="5.04">footnote implies ambassador downer but</text>
  <text start="1565.9" dur="6.33">now but you can see that&amp;#39;s not actually</text>
  <text start="1568" dur="6.48">what happened this is an example of wise</text>
  <text start="1572.23" dur="4.74">Mueller disguising the actual origin in</text>
  <text start="1574.48" dur="4.38">their report they are giving cover to</text>
  <text start="1576.97" dur="3.39">the reality that unofficial intelligence</text>
  <text start="1578.86" dur="5.04">was actually the basis for the</text>
  <text start="1580.36" dur="5.7">originating electronic communication or</text>
  <text start="1583.9" dur="4.68">two-page electronic communication from</text>
  <text start="1586.06" dur="5.22">CIA director John Brennan to FBI</text>
  <text start="1588.58" dur="4.86">director James Comey it was the two-page</text>
  <text start="1591.28" dur="4.38">electronic communication likely written</text>
  <text start="1593.44" dur="4.62">by FBI counterintelligence agent Peter</text>
  <text start="1595.66" dur="4.92">struck that initiated crossfire</text>
  <text start="1598.06" dur="4.38">hurricane the page in Weissman Mueller</text>
  <text start="1600.58" dur="5.22">report is factually true because the</text>
  <text start="1602.44" dur="5.49">inference but but the inference is false</text>
  <text start="1605.8" dur="4.05">it is written in a way that they</text>
  <text start="1607.93" dur="4.98">intended to give a false impression it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1609.85" dur="4.77">quite subtle and sneaky all right so</text>
  <text start="1612.91" dur="3.39">they so they keep going and then they</text>
  <text start="1614.62" dur="3.75">talk about where the you know the FBI</text>
  <text start="1616.3" dur="4.71">track was the steel dossier and the FISA</text>
  <text start="1618.37" dur="5.22">warrant they basically said that he is a</text>
  <text start="1621.01" dur="5.85">carter page he is a u.s. person and an</text>
  <text start="1623.59" dur="5.88">agent of a foreign power it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1626.86" dur="5.88">unbelievable right so he was already</text>
  <text start="1629.47" dur="6.9">known we know now that quarter-page was</text>
  <text start="1632.74" dur="6.57">not only an informant for the FBI but</text>
  <text start="1636.37" dur="5.04">also to the CIA all right so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1639.31" dur="5.7">that&amp;#39;s a little iffy there to me but</text>
  <text start="1641.41" dur="5.85">okay anyway the FBI knew Carter page</text>
  <text start="1645.01" dur="3.96">essentially Carter page was irrelevant</text>
  <text start="1647.26" dur="3.99">what they needed was a FISA warrant and</text>
  <text start="1648.97" dur="5.52">the dossier in the system as their</text>
  <text start="1651.25" dur="5.61">insurance policy so we see two parallel</text>
  <text start="1654.49" dur="4.59">tracks one from the CIA one from the FBI</text>
  <text start="1656.86" dur="4.2">both intended to provide a cover story</text>
  <text start="1659.08" dur="3.48">for political surveillance and spy</text>
  <text start="1661.06" dur="2.94">operations that person they both have</text>
  <text start="1662.56" dur="4.32">the same source isn&amp;#39;t that awful</text>
  <text start="1664" dur="5.82">the CIA track created crossfire</text>
  <text start="1666.88" dur="5.13">hurricane the FBI the FBI track created</text>
  <text start="1669.82" dur="8.4">the steel dossier but both have the same</text>
  <text start="1672.01" dur="9.45">purpose it&amp;#39;s ridiculous you guys oh so</text>
  <text start="1678.22" dur="6.09">and then here is the 99 page where they</text>
  <text start="1681.46" dur="6.39">actually broke the law and judge Collier</text>
  <text start="1684.31" dur="8.07">said so all right so that is the tooth</text>
  <text start="1687.85" dur="6.93">that is unbelievable but I just wanted</text>
  <text start="1692.38" dur="4.5">you to see how he&amp;#39;s discussing the</text>
  <text start="1694.78" dur="4.05">corruption and that new whistleblowers</text>

  <text start="2420.57" dur="4.23">know what does but with that I want to</text>
  <text start="2423.57" dur="2.28">thank the witnesses for appearing today</text>
  <text start="2424.8" dur="3.93">and I yield back</text>

  <text start="2428.73" dur="3.75">choppy it was from Twitter I have all</text>
  <text start="2430.26" dur="5.28">the I have the tweets listed in the show</text>
  <text start="2432.48" dur="5.37">notes so it says Mueller report steel</text>

  <text start="2450.36" dur="4.86">exposed as yet another Democrat created</text>
  <text start="2452.91" dur="4.23">hoax I mean he says this and then it</text>
  <text start="2455.22" dur="5.97">refers to an epoch Times article where</text>
  <text start="2457.14" dur="6.45">they pointed out some of the crafty</text>
