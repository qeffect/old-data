  <text start="471.33" dur="3.559">impeachment role for the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="475.46" dur="4.62">so this long article kind of goes</text>
  <text start="477.93" dur="3.9">through why they think that since the</text>
  <text start="480.08" dur="4.059">articles of impeachment were</text>
  <text start="481.83" dur="4.559">unconstitutional then it should go to</text>
  <text start="484.139" dur="5.071">the Supreme Court to be worked out first</text>
  <text start="486.389" dur="4.891">right do the charges against Trump pass</text>

  <text start="3075.66" dur="2.61">put in place we told the court we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3077.1" dur="3.06">gonna need some period of time to work</text>
  <text start="3078.27" dur="5.25">our way through that the court granted</text>
  <text start="3080.16" dur="5.61">us that time in return the court also</text>
  <text start="3083.52" dur="4.89">said we will allow you to continue 702</text>
  <text start="3085.77" dur="5.91">under the 16 authorizations but we will</text>
  <text start="3088.41" dur="5.37">not will not reauthorize 17 until you</text>
  <text start="3091.68" dur="4.02">show us that you have addressed this we</text>
  <text start="3093.78" dur="3.33">then went through an internal process</text>
  <text start="3095.7" dur="3.93">interacted with the Department of</text>
  <text start="3097.11" dur="4.53">Justice as well as the court and by</text>
  <text start="3099.63" dur="3.48">March we had come to a solution that the</text>
  <text start="3101.64" dur="3.45">FISA Court was comfortable with the</text>
  <text start="3103.11" dur="4.26">court then authorized us to execute that</text>
  <text start="3105.09" dur="4.8">solution and also then granted us</text>
  <text start="3107.37" dur="4.53">authority for the 17 702 effort so you</text>
  <text start="3109.89" dur="3.78">reported initially to the court this is</text>
  <text start="3111.9" dur="3.15">an issue or the court initially came to</text>
  <text start="3113.67" dur="2.76">you and said we have an issue I went to</text>
  <text start="3115.05" dur="2.82">the court and said we have an issue and</text>
  <text start="3116.43" dur="4.11">the court said it we agree we have a</text>
  <text start="3117.87" dur="4.2">problem as well jack and then it got</text>
  <text start="3120.54" dur="4.11">held up went through the process of</text>
  <text start="3122.07" dur="5.25">review then the court is now signed off</text>
  <text start="3124.65" dur="4.53">on the other 16 that is correct so how</text>
  <text start="3127.32" dur="3.81">does this harm your collection</text>
  <text start="3129.18" dur="4.44">capabilities to be able to not do the</text>
  <text start="3131.13" dur="4.56">about collections so I I acknowledge</text>
  <text start="3133.62" dur="4.59">that in doing this we were gonna lose</text>
  <text start="3135.69" dur="5.19">some intelligence value but my concern</text>
  <text start="3138.21" dur="4.77">was I just felt it was important we</text>
  <text start="3140.88" dur="5.16">needed to be able to show that we were</text>
  <text start="3142.98" dur="4.44">fully compliant with the law so</text>
  <text start="3146.04" dur="2.88">basically I just played you this little</text>
