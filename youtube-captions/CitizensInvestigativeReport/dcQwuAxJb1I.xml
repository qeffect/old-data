  <text start="348.43" dur="4.32">know I told Andy and you know bother</text>
  <text start="350.35" dur="4.14">arguing about it okay the OIG also found</text>
  <text start="352.75" dur="4.23">that the dad engaged in misconduct when</text>
  <text start="354.49" dur="4.95">he accepted a ticket approximately</text>

  <text start="364.12" dur="7.56">federal regulations and FBI policy</text>
  <text start="367.08" dur="7.06">prosecution of the dad was declined so</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="7.26">he&amp;#39;s not going to be um he&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="374.14" dur="7.44">to be prosecuted for that probably</text>
  <text start="378.94" dur="7.62">because he&amp;#39;s in big much more big</text>
  <text start="381.58" dur="7.29">trouble for his other actions are way</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="4.02">more worse than this right so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="388.87" dur="3.99">probably cooperating the OIG has</text>
  <text start="390.58" dur="3.84">completed this investigation and is</text>
  <text start="392.86" dur="4.17">providing this front report to the FBI</text>
  <text start="394.42" dur="4.35">for appropriate action well Peters</text>
  <text start="397.03" dur="2.01">trucks already been fired so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="398.77" dur="4.98">know</text>
  <text start="399.04" dur="6.54">more they can really do if the FBI now</text>
  <text start="403.75" dur="4.98">wants to refer it it&amp;#39;s already been</text>
  <text start="405.58" dur="4.8">declined so prosecution was declined so</text>
  <text start="408.73" dur="4.56">we know that all right that&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="410.38" dur="6.72">that came out today and what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="413.29" dur="6.69">thinking is seems to me like the any any</text>

  <text start="432.37" dur="4.56">what Mueller did today and how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.41" dur="5.13">basically being handed now to the</text>

  <text start="449.31" dur="5.23">other people need to take can hold him</text>
  <text start="452.41" dur="3.57">accountable for that not him and he</text>
  <text start="454.54" dur="3.24">talks about the standards of evidence</text>

  <text start="613.42" dur="3.149">there was not enough evidence to prove</text>
  <text start="614.769" dur="3.87">conspiracy but prosecutors could not</text>
  <text start="616.569" dur="3.99">exonerate President Trump on obstruction</text>
  <text start="618.639" dur="3.39">let&amp;#39;s bring in trey Gowdy former House</text>
  <text start="620.559" dur="3.78">Oversight Committee chairman and Fox</text>
  <text start="622.029" dur="5.37">News contributor I wanted to talk a</text>
  <text start="624.339" dur="5.24">couple of angles with you one it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="627.399" dur="5.851">interesting in a special councils report</text>
  <text start="629.579" dur="6.041">to have insufficient evidence versus no</text>
  <text start="633.25" dur="4.679">evidence right so but but if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="635.62" dur="6.809">have a case you as prosecutors sometimes</text>
  <text start="637.929" dur="6.39">you have to let it go yeah they made a</text>
  <text start="642.429" dur="3.63">couple of evidentiary thresholds may</text>
  <text start="644.319" dur="3.481">takes probable calls to indict someone</text>
  <text start="646.059" dur="3.601">or arrest them but it takes beyond a</text>
  <text start="647.8" dur="3.979">reasonable doubt to get a conviction and</text>
  <text start="649.66" dur="4.56">most prosecutors if you don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="651.779" dur="4.87">realistic likelihood of a successful</text>
  <text start="654.22" dur="4.65">outcome you&amp;#39;re not going to try the case</text>
  <text start="656.649" dur="3.99">so you can have probable cause you could</text>
  <text start="658.87" dur="3.48">get an indictment you could get an</text>
  <text start="660.639" dur="4.74">arrest warrant but you got no chance of</text>
  <text start="662.35" dur="4.35">winning I don&amp;#39;t know where this falls in</text>
  <text start="665.379" dur="4.171">the evidentiary I</text>
  <text start="666.7" dur="5.07">think it&amp;#39;s above no evidence but whether</text>
  <text start="669.55" dur="3.78">or not it&amp;#39;s enough to have indicted look</text>
  <text start="671.77" dur="3.45">I listen to every warmest press</text>
  <text start="673.33" dur="3.63">conference I still don&amp;#39;t know whether or</text>
  <text start="675.22" dur="3.99">not he would have indicted but for that</text>
  <text start="676.96" dur="4.56">OLC opinion I don&amp;#39;t what do you think of</text>
  <text start="679.21" dur="5.16">that discrepancy people are pointing to</text>
  <text start="681.52" dur="4.62">between what bill Barr had said Muller</text>
  <text start="684.37" dur="4.47">told him and what Muller said today that</text>
  <text start="686.14" dur="7.11">that was the stumbling block walk for</text>
  <text start="688.84" dur="7.05">him on obstruction I&amp;#39;m still not clear</text>
  <text start="693.25" dur="4.26">whether that I don&amp;#39;t know what this is</text>
  <text start="695.89" dur="4.05">one of the president&amp;#39;s options and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="697.51" dur="4.53">not his lawyer I&amp;#39;m not ever gonna be his</text>
  <text start="699.94" dur="3.75">lawyer but you know you can waive any</text>
  <text start="702.04" dur="3.21">right you have Dana you have the right</text>
  <text start="703.69" dur="2.97">to remain silent but you can talk to the</text>
  <text start="705.25" dur="3.36">police if you want to you have a right</text>
  <text start="706.66" dur="4.29">to a jury trial but you can plead guilty</text>
  <text start="708.61" dur="4.92">if you want to I&amp;#39;ll bet the president</text>
  <text start="710.95" dur="5.34">has the right to say go ahead indict me</text>
  <text start="713.53" dur="4.65">if you have enough the Supreme Court&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="716.29" dur="5.16">never said that I can&amp;#39;t be indicted this</text>
  <text start="718.18" dur="5.07">is DOJ I&amp;#39;m the head of DOJ I run the</text>
  <text start="721.45" dur="4.23">executive branch if you have enough to</text>
  <text start="723.25" dur="3.9">indict me go ahead and do it at least</text>
  <text start="725.68" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;ll have some clarity what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="727.15" dur="5.04">gonna have now for the next 14 months is</text>
  <text start="729.55" dur="4.17">an impeachment investigation by folks</text>
  <text start="732.19" dur="3.3">who have already made up their mind I</text>
  <text start="733.72" dur="4.23">mean 60 of them wanted to impeach him</text>
  <text start="735.49" dur="4.47">before Muller wrote a single-syllable of</text>
  <text start="737.95" dur="4.5">his report the jury is never going to</text>
  <text start="739.96" dur="5.42">convict him so we&amp;#39;re gonna be in this</text>
  <text start="742.45" dur="5.28">state of chaos for the next 14 months</text>
  <text start="745.38" dur="4.18">look I don&amp;#39;t think that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="747.73" dur="3.6">prosecutable case for obstruction I</text>
  <text start="749.56" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t know everything but for what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="751.33" dur="5.55">seen firing Jim Comey is not obstruction</text>
  <text start="754.03" dur="4.62">of justice so if the president has the</text>
  <text start="756.88" dur="3.75">right to waive his right to remain</text>
  <text start="758.65" dur="4.08">silent does he also have the right to</text>
  <text start="760.63" dur="5.04">waive his right to not be indicted while</text>
  <text start="762.73" dur="5.22">president I take my chances with 12</text>
  <text start="765.67" dur="3.75">reasonable minded fellow citizens before</text>
  <text start="767.95" dur="4.02">I would in the House Democrat take a</text>
  <text start="769.42" dur="4.08">listen to chairman Jerry Nadler of the</text>
  <text start="771.97" dur="4.59">House Judiciary Committee earlier just</text>
  <text start="773.5" dur="5.13">in this hour with respect to impeachment</text>
  <text start="776.56" dur="4.26">question at this point all options are</text>
  <text start="778.63" dur="4.41">on the table and nothing should be ruled</text>
  <text start="780.82" dur="4.47">out the president so the president is</text>
  <text start="783.04" dur="4.68">lying about the special counsels</text>
  <text start="785.29" dur="4.17">findings lying and saying that the</text>
  <text start="787.72" dur="3.45">special counsel found no obstruction and</text>
  <text start="789.46" dur="3.18">no conclusion and I should add the</text>
  <text start="791.17" dur="4.08">Attorney General is lying about that too</text>
  <text start="792.64" dur="4.17">that is serious and we will take action</text>
  <text start="795.25" dur="4.26">to hold the president accountable for</text>
  <text start="796.81" dur="3.66">his misconduct again I&amp;#39;ll repeat no one</text>
  <text start="799.51" dur="5.01">not even the</text>
  <text start="800.47" dur="5.52">is above the law a a lot very strong</text>
  <text start="804.52" dur="3.3">language and the president and the</text>
  <text start="805.99" dur="4.83">Attorney General are lying about the</text>
  <text start="807.82" dur="4.8">report yeah I noticed I would also</text>
  <text start="810.82" dur="3.09">noticed the word misconduct and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="812.62" dur="2.94">beginning to wonder if we live in a</text>
  <text start="813.91" dur="4.08">country were there any presumptions of</text>
  <text start="815.56" dur="2.97">innocence I mean I mean chef has him in</text>
  <text start="817.99" dur="2.67">jail</text>
  <text start="818.53" dur="5.01">never has already concluded a misconduct</text>
  <text start="820.66" dur="5.13">Dana remember 60 House Democrats voted</text>
  <text start="823.54" dur="4.77">to move forward with impeachment before</text>
  <text start="825.79" dur="4.56">Muller released a single syllable of his</text>
  <text start="828.31" dur="4.95">report so the notion that there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="830.35" dur="5.07">dispassionate objective open-minded</text>
  <text start="833.26" dur="4.23">group on the Democrats on House</text>
  <text start="835.42" dur="3.9">Judiciary they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="837.49" dur="3.45">the politics of going forward with</text>
  <text start="839.32" dur="4.05">impeachment when you know you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="840.94" dur="4.5">going to get a conviction what this may</text>
  <text start="843.37" dur="3.63">result in is twenty-twenty being a</text>
  <text start="845.44" dur="3.39">referendum on whether or not you want to</text>
  <text start="847" dur="4.11">see Donald Trump indicted that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="848.83" dur="3.75">this is like and I know one of the</text>
  <text start="851.11" dur="3.24">frustrations you had when you were in</text>
  <text start="852.58" dur="3.36">Congress is there&amp;#39;s this disconnect from</text>
  <text start="854.35" dur="3.15">what your constituents and the voters</text>
  <text start="855.94" dur="3.72">are wanting people to work on in</text>
  <text start="857.5" dur="3.57">Washington and what actually ends up</text>
  <text start="859.66" dur="3.69">happening and if we end up in an</text>
  <text start="861.07" dur="5.25">impeachment situation then nothing is</text>
  <text start="863.35" dur="4.56">going to get done well you could argue</text>
  <text start="866.32" dur="3.15">not a whole I was getting done right now</text>
  <text start="867.91" dur="4.44">but you&amp;#39;re right nothing&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="869.47" dur="4.83">done it&amp;#39;s all about 2020 I was actually</text>
  <text start="872.35" dur="3.33">heartened I&amp;#39;m a cynic but I was</text>
  <text start="874.3" dur="3.84">heartened by the fact that Muller</text>
  <text start="875.68" dur="4.83">started with Russia he ended with Russia</text>
  <text start="878.14" dur="7.32">and he was most passionate about Russia</text>
  <text start="880.51" dur="6.63">the problem is no one in the house or</text>
  <text start="885.46" dur="4.02">very few in the house fear with that</text>
  <text start="887.14" dur="7.92">same passion about attacking Russia as</text>
  <text start="889.48" dur="8.1">the enemy but Muller began and ended his</text>
  <text start="895.06" dur="5.01">statement specifically looking at Russia</text>
  <text start="897.58" dur="3.96">so there is that all right drei Gowdy</text>
