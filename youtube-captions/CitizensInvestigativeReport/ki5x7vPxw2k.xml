  <text start="5.69" dur="4">our country had to live through this two</text>
  <text start="7.799" dur="4.201">and a half years saga because of one guy</text>
  <text start="9.69" dur="4.29">Jim Comey Jim Comey&amp;#39;s the guy opens the</text>
  <text start="12" dur="3.42">investigation in July of 2016 Jim</text>
  <text start="13.98" dur="3.18">Comey&amp;#39;s a guy puts Peter struck in</text>
  <text start="15.42" dur="2.939">charge of it the same guy who ran the</text>
  <text start="17.16" dur="2.85">Clinton investigation the same guy who</text>
  <text start="18.359" dur="3.901">said Trump should lose a hundred million</text>
  <text start="20.01" dur="3.81">to zero that&amp;#39;s a guy puts in charge Jim</text>
  <text start="22.26" dur="3.09">Comey&amp;#39;s the guy who allows the dossier</text>
  <text start="23.82" dur="3.75">to be used to get a warrant to spawn a</text>
  <text start="25.35" dur="4.47">fellow American citizen and Jim Comey&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="27.57" dur="4.56">the guy who leaks sensitive information</text>
  <text start="29.82" dur="4.05">broke the rules of the FBI leaked</text>
  <text start="32.13" dur="3.48">sensitive information to the New York</text>
  <text start="33.87" dur="2.61">Times through his friend Daniel Richmond</text>
  <text start="35.61" dur="3.3">for what reason</text>
  <text start="36.48" dur="4.5">to get a special counsel who put the</text>
  <text start="38.91" dur="4.079">country through this entire saga that</text>
  <text start="40.98" dur="3.66">was based on a false accusation so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="42.989" dur="3.57">not gonna apologize Jim Comey owes the</text>
  <text start="44.64" dur="2.939">country an apology because he put us</text>
  <text start="46.559" dur="3.781">through this for two-and-a-half years</text>
  <text start="47.579" dur="4.14">and we know he did it we know he did it</text>
  <text start="50.34" dur="3.42">because he was out to get the president</text>
  <text start="51.719" dur="3.57">based on what happened in that January</text>
  <text start="53.76" dur="3.51">sixth meeting that you talked about at</text>
  <text start="55.289" dur="3.45">the Trump Tower where he used the news</text>
  <text start="57.27" dur="3.179">hook about the dossier talking to the</text>
  <text start="58.739" dur="4.351">president about the dossier and it says</text>
  <text start="60.449" dur="4.201">on page 17 of the report they did it to</text>
  <text start="63.09" dur="3.42">try to get information trapped the</text>
  <text start="64.65" dur="3.36">president all the while he was telling</text>
  <text start="66.51" dur="4.41">the president you&amp;#39;re not under</text>
  <text start="68.01" dur="5.429">investigation go bad as it gets that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.92" dur="3.96">as bad as it gets it commis responsible</text>
  <text start="73.439" dur="3.511">for the whole darn two-and-a-half year</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="3.72">thing that&amp;#39;s an extremely important</text>
  <text start="76.95" dur="5.059">point Molly at the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="78.6" dur="5.67">angle you were nodding about something</text>
  <text start="82.009" dur="4.421">that you thought was important that</text>
  <text start="84.27" dur="4.11">probably hasn&amp;#39;t got as much attention I</text>
  <text start="86.43" dur="5.22">believe it was about the fact that they</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="5.79">were ready to move on this before the</text>
  <text start="91.65" dur="4.41">Trump Tower meeting that his cohorts</text>
  <text start="94.17" dur="4.71">told him immortalize these things and</text>
  <text start="96.06" dur="4.44">memos get this down on paper that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="98.88" dur="3.09">I mean there&amp;#39;s so much in this IG report</text>
  <text start="100.5" dur="2.759">I don&amp;#39;t think people realize usually IG</text>
  <text start="101.97" dur="3.329">reports aren&amp;#39;t full of this type of</text>
  <text start="103.259" dur="3.93">information and this type of strong</text>
  <text start="105.299" dur="4.411">language we had already known about that</text>
  <text start="107.189" dur="4.261">briefing of the dossier or that just one</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="3.72">portion of the dossier to trump because</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="3.15">it immediately leaked to CNN and I think</text>
  <text start="113.43" dur="3.119">a lot of people thought that was the</text>
  <text start="114.6" dur="3.24">purpose of the briefing was so that it</text>
  <text start="116.549" dur="4.081">could be immediately leaked to CNN</text>
  <text start="117.84" dur="4.29">creating this Russia hoax hysteria but</text>
  <text start="120.63" dur="2.79">what we also learned in the IG report</text>
  <text start="122.13" dur="2.849">today is that they were using that</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="3.629">information as they were using that</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="4.021">meeting as a way to get information</text>
  <text start="127.049" dur="4.501">about a Russia hoax that they apparently</text>
  <text start="129" dur="3.599">really believed which is deeply alarming</text>
  <text start="131.55" dur="2.4">that they fell for something that</text>
  <text start="132.599" dur="2.581">preposterous</text>
  <text start="133.95" dur="2.7">they briefed him in the hopes that he</text>
  <text start="135.18" dur="2.76">would give them information that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="136.65" dur="3.39">he immediately goes to the car and</text>
  <text start="137.94" dur="5.15">starts starts typing a memo and there</text>
  <text start="140.04" dur="5.91">was already a secure hookup back when he</text>
  <text start="143.09" dur="4.119">caught fire hurricane team because they</text>
  <text start="145.95" dur="3.569">anticipated that they were going to get</text>
  <text start="147.209" dur="4.171">information for this Russia story it</text>
  <text start="149.519" dur="4.351">does leak then the next day shockingly</text>
  <text start="151.38" dur="4.17">CNN was looking for a hook to be able to</text>
  <text start="153.87" dur="4.35">talk about this dossier which has been</text>
  <text start="155.55" dur="3.15">shown to be just complete and see hey</text>

  <text start="228.18" dur="7.05">you post 3569 was given on August the</text>
  <text start="232.859" dur="4.321">1st and it was the fox news article that</text>
  <text start="235.23" dur="4.379">said the DOJ will not prosecute Comey</text>
  <text start="237.18" dur="6.66">for leaking memos after the IG referral</text>
  <text start="239.609" dur="6.541">source okay so we knew this was not we</text>
  <text start="243.84" dur="6.179">knew he was not going to be prosecuted</text>
  <text start="246.15" dur="6.39">we knew this the IG report it came out</text>
  <text start="250.019" dur="4.321">separately for a separate reason anyway</text>
  <text start="252.54" dur="5.099">he they&amp;#39;re saying bigger he says big</text>
  <text start="254.34" dur="5.61">bigger slam dunk charges coming public</text>
  <text start="257.639" dur="4.44">understanding of events just around the</text>
  <text start="259.95" dur="4.89">corner just around the corner</text>
  <text start="262.079" dur="5.041">okay so I mean Tim oh is it tomorrow no</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="3.15">it&amp;#39;s not we have to get the IG report on</text>
  <text start="267.12" dur="3.51">the</text>
  <text start="267.99" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s the next big thing so although</text>
  <text start="270.63" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re not gonna get any you know I know</text>
  <text start="272.85" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s frustrating just to watch him act</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="7.98">like he does but he&amp;#39;s not out of the</text>
  <text start="278.67" dur="6.75">woods alright and so I just want to make</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="3.72">sure that you know everybody understands</text>
  <text start="285.42" dur="4.17">we were told this ahead of time it was</text>
  <text start="287.22" dur="5.7">printed you know from Fox News ahead of</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="4.89">time that we are not going to get there</text>
  <text start="292.92" dur="4.08">not going to be prosecuted for leaking</text>
  <text start="294.48" dur="4.2">the memos alright even after that</text>
  <text start="297" dur="4.22">because the IG refer to but now the</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="5.01">reports out so just kind of you know</text>
  <text start="301.22" dur="4.93">this was not a surprise for us but</text>
  <text start="303.69" dur="8.46">however let me show you what is coming</text>
  <text start="306.15" dur="7.77">up all right so it says the Department</text>
  <text start="312.15" dur="4.44">of Justice Inspector General just fired</text>
  <text start="313.92" dur="4.98">the first of three cruise missiles trade</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="4.74">none Comey with devastating impact</text>
  <text start="318.9" dur="7.23">Kobe&amp;#39;s reaction feel free to apologize</text>
  <text start="321.33" dur="6.48">to me so smug rushing into victim land</text>
  <text start="326.13" dur="5.58">is common strategy for the corner</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="6.48">another is striking out an imagined</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="5.43">notable excuse me noble duty to a</text>
  <text start="334.29" dur="5.04">contrived higher authority yeah Lucifer</text>
  <text start="337.14" dur="4.07">one that looks strikingly similar to the</text>
  <text start="339.33" dur="5.46">image he sees in the mirror each morning</text>
  <text start="341.21" dur="5.38">this is John Solomon but here in the</text>
  <text start="344.79" dur="4.38">real world this is what the IG</text>
  <text start="346.59" dur="5.46">investigation has confirmed and this is</text>
  <text start="349.17" dur="4.53">important okay James Comey as FBI</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="4.41">director created and maintained a</text>
  <text start="353.7" dur="5.55">separate record of system records system</text>
  <text start="356.46" dur="4.98">that he kept in his desk drawer he then</text>
  <text start="359.25" dur="3.99">also took most of these those official</text>
  <text start="361.44" dur="5.01">records home if that wasn&amp;#39;t enough</text>
  <text start="363.24" dur="5.01">reckless this he leaked some of these</text>
  <text start="366.45" dur="4.65">records to the press after he was fired</text>
  <text start="368.25" dur="5.01">to Comey all this is justified because</text>
  <text start="371.1" dur="4.8">some hero has to rise up and stand in</text>
  <text start="373.26" dur="4.62">the breach but the IG methodically lists</text>
  <text start="375.9" dur="4.56">the numerous policies come evaluated</text>
  <text start="377.88" dur="4.65">policies carefully designed over time to</text>
  <text start="380.46" dur="4.32">prevent the abuse of authority by those</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="4.56">who self craft a higher loyalty in their</text>
  <text start="384.78" dur="4.5">minds their by exempting themselves from</text>
  <text start="387.09" dur="4.41">the rules come he was no hero he was</text>
  <text start="389.28" dur="4.23">nothing more than an executive vigilante</text>
  <text start="391.5" dur="4.04">creating a separate record system the</text>
  <text start="393.51" dur="4.8">FBI is a mortal sin and with good reason</text>
  <text start="395.54" dur="5.47">every newly minted agent at Quantico</text>
  <text start="398.31" dur="5.13">learns this as part of the FBI 101</text>
  <text start="401.01" dur="4.47">anytime an agent to include the director</text>
  <text start="403.44" dur="4.59">of all people good lord collects</text>
  <text start="405.48" dur="3.99">information in an official capacity that</text>
  <text start="408.03" dur="3.45">information must be documented</text>
  <text start="409.47" dur="3.84">associated with the case file number and</text>
  <text start="411.48" dur="4.35">entered into the FBI&amp;#39;s case management</text>
  <text start="413.31" dur="5.07">system Cobie never did that in fact he</text>
  <text start="415.83" dur="4.41">is now in his now infamous memos weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="418.38" dur="4.23">entered into the official FBI system</text>
  <text start="420.24" dur="4.32">until after he was fired having one</text>
  <text start="422.61" dur="4.59">system of record ensures that all</text>
  <text start="424.56" dur="6.81">information collected is searchable okay</text>
  <text start="427.2" dur="6.21">so you know and then he&amp;#39;s John Solomon</text>
  <text start="431.37" dur="4.47">says he&amp;#39;s quoted extensively in the IG</text>
  <text start="433.41" dur="5.55">report and appears nonchalant in his</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="5.7">disregard for such rules his he asserts</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="5.01">a theory of personal property over the</text>
  <text start="441.54" dur="5.49">memos he wrote that the IG could easily</text>
  <text start="443.97" dur="5.31">swats aside in a shallow absurdity but</text>
  <text start="447.03" dur="4.14">his obsession of his assertion of</text>
  <text start="449.28" dur="3.45">personal ownership of the menno&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.17" dur="3.21">documenting his encounters with the</text>
  <text start="452.73" dur="4.92">president does give off a whiff of</text>
  <text start="454.38" dur="5.52">self-interest that a future memoir was</text>
  <text start="457.65" dur="4.71">his true motivator less than a year</text>
  <text start="459.9" dur="4.26">after his firing wah-wah his book a</text>
  <text start="462.36" dur="4.5">higher loyalty was published</text>
  <text start="464.16" dur="6.27">yeah higher loyalty to Lucifer once</text>
  <text start="466.86" dur="5.64">again we know this okay so it&amp;#39;s not so</text>
  <text start="470.43" dur="4.44">he&amp;#39;s saying even though Comey may try to</text>
  <text start="472.5" dur="4.38">deflect with some celebratory comments</text>
  <text start="474.87" dur="4.92">that he wasn&amp;#39;t charged with mishandling</text>
  <text start="476.88" dur="5.49">classified information he remains in a</text>
  <text start="479.79" dur="5.37">precarious position and trend lines</text>
  <text start="482.37" dur="5.16">aren&amp;#39;t good next up this is what he was</text>
  <text start="485.16" dur="4.5">talking about will be the IDS findings</text>
  <text start="487.53" dur="4.13">regarding Soames truthfulness before the</text>
  <text start="489.66" dur="6.03">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</text>
  <text start="491.66" dur="5.83">Court and whether he attested to false</text>
  <text start="495.69" dur="3.63">or misleading statements in order to</text>
  <text start="497.49" dur="7.8">electronically monitor a presidential</text>
  <text start="499.32" dur="7.89">campaign and I think this is a reason it</text>
  <text start="505.29" dur="5.28">was brought up was all that came out in</text>
  <text start="507.21" dur="6.99">there in there of how he you know he</text>
  <text start="510.57" dur="6.36">went there pronounced and you know he</text>
  <text start="514.2" dur="5.31">was basically he set the president up</text>
  <text start="516.93" dur="4.32">health is salacious and unverified</text>
  <text start="519.51" dur="3.719">information over the president&amp;#39;s head</text>
  <text start="521.25" dur="3.54">like hey this is gonna leak out into the</text>
  <text start="523.229" dur="3.301">media so I&amp;#39;m just gonna tell you about</text>
  <text start="524.79" dur="2.94">it now to say you know you&amp;#39;re not under</text>
  <text start="526.53" dur="3.54">investigation though don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="527.73" dur="4.549">it even though in his own notes he said</text>
  <text start="530.07" dur="3.65">he says you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.279" dur="3.031">to see if he incriminate himself</text>
  <text start="533.72" dur="2.82">basically if he says gets any</text>
  <text start="535.31" dur="2.939">information he can gather the</text>
  <text start="536.54" dur="4.95">information and how do we know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.249" dur="5.28">true he got into his car he starts</text>
  <text start="541.49" dur="4.529">making the notes the minute he gets back</text>
  <text start="543.529" dur="4.651">to the FBI and probably on the way they</text>
  <text start="546.019" dur="4.86">have a you know they have like a</text>
  <text start="548.18" dur="5.339">closed-circuit TV conference with the</text>
  <text start="550.879" dur="4.111">crossfire hurricane team to you so he</text>
  <text start="553.519" dur="2.701">could say oh this is what he said this</text>
  <text start="554.99" dur="3.569">is what he said this is what he said</text>
  <text start="556.22" dur="3.69">basically they were investigating him</text>
  <text start="558.559" dur="4.621">but they lied to him and told him they</text>
  <text start="559.91" dur="5.82">weren&amp;#39;t okay so and cute talks about</text>
  <text start="563.18" dur="4.469">this how it came out that you know Trump</text>
  <text start="565.73" dur="4.019">really wasn&amp;#39;t under investigation well</text>
  <text start="567.649" dur="3.841">yeah you know it&amp;#39;s one of those let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="569.749" dur="4.59">add that to the pile of one plus one</text>

  <text start="722.24" dur="4.909">it&amp;#39;s their bill it&amp;#39;s a building block</text>
  <text start="723.86" dur="5.76">one block after another</text>
  <text start="727.149" dur="7.06">okay so then I&amp;#39;m gonna go to this piece</text>

  <text start="757.16" dur="5.19">investigation addressed them he did the</text>
  <text start="760.43" dur="6.99">upshot of that was nailed by Byron York</text>
  <text start="762.35" dur="8.219">and his Washington Examiner report what</text>
  <text start="767.42" dur="7.74">we learn is that Comey and his top FBI</text>
  <text start="770.569" dur="8.671">advisers prepared extensively for the</text>
  <text start="775.16" dur="6.15">then directors January 6 2017 briefing</text>

  <text start="785.72" dur="5.19">detailed preparation excuse me</text>
  <text start="788.18" dur="4.92">ode to the fact that the FBI regarded</text>
  <text start="790.91" dur="5.039">this session at Trump Tower in New York</text>
  <text start="793.1" dur="5.7">not as a mere briefing but as an</text>
  <text start="795.949" dur="4.081">evidence gathering opportunity that was</text>
  <text start="798.8" dur="3.51">because they were investigating</text>
  <text start="800.03" dur="4.98">Trump which they hope to continue to</text>
  <text start="802.31" dur="4.29">doing when he took office which called</text>
  <text start="805.01" dur="3.51">for putting him at ease which meant</text>
  <text start="806.6" dur="5.34">telling him they were not investigating</text>
