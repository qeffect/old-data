  <text start="133.75" dur="5.22">about a llevaba a cleansing of the FBI</text>

  <text start="184.33" dur="5.519">that&amp;#39;s why connecting the dots is</text>
  <text start="186.099" dur="5.791">important because the FBI now has to be</text>

  <text start="191.89" dur="3.75">up the men and women at the bureau are</text>

  <text start="219.19" dur="5.549">evidence this this is what people have</text>
  <text start="221.29" dur="6.15">to understand what the bureau did was by</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="5.58">working with fusion gps and giving</text>
  <text start="227.44" dur="4.95">contractors access to highly classified</text>
  <text start="230.319" dur="5.221">information which they had no legal</text>
  <text start="232.39" dur="5.159">right to see they needed to create</text>
  <text start="235.54" dur="4.229">something they could give to the court</text>
  <text start="237.549" dur="4.401">the Foreign Intelligence Court so that</text>

  <text start="251.079" dur="4.261">course there was nothing there was there</text>
  <text start="253.39" dur="4.409">never was anything and they created</text>
  <text start="255.34" dur="5.13">false facts so that they could get</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="5.821">surveillance warrants those are all</text>
  <text start="260.47" dur="5.58">crimes every single one of those acts</text>
  <text start="263.62" dur="4.049">constitutes a crime because it was done</text>
  <text start="266.05" dur="4.35">not for a legitimate law enforcement</text>
  <text start="267.669" dur="6.151">reason not for national security reasons</text>
  <text start="270.4" dur="6.99">but to create a false case against a</text>

  <text start="295.479" dur="6.301">were Fuzion GPS and CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="300.539" dur="4">CrowdStrike</text>

  <text start="311.89" dur="3.85">is being reported is true and I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="314.68" dur="3.82">two reports about</text>

  <text start="328.55" dur="6.769">that is true they have committed crimes</text>
  <text start="332.53" dur="7.03">the Bureau who gave them information</text>

  <text start="354.71" dur="6.269">the payment of fusion GPS diffusion GPS</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="6.179">has been sued I expect if these facts</text>
  <text start="360.979" dur="4.68">come out from the FISA Court showing</text>
  <text start="364.039" dur="4.321">that these contractors got this</text>
  <text start="365.659" dur="4.831">information they will all be sued now</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="6.36">they may declare bankruptcy and not be</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="5.85">able to pay but the people don&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="374.72" dur="4.289">that this is already on the public</text>
  <text start="376.34" dur="5.1">record that these things happen the</text>
  <text start="379.009" dur="4.44">question which has been blanked out from</text>
  <text start="381.44" dur="3.509">this opinion as you can see this is all</text>
  <text start="383.449" dur="3">dark all through the opinion what</text>
  <text start="384.949" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;ve done is they&amp;#39;ve blanked out the</text>
  <text start="386.449" dur="5.22">names of the contractors and the names</text>
  <text start="388.789" dur="5.43">of the FBI and DOJ officials who broke</text>
  <text start="391.669" dur="4.921">the law that is going to come out</text>
  <text start="394.219" dur="4.351">that&amp;#39;s what Nunez has he has all that</text>
  <text start="396.59" dur="4.199">information now he knows what&amp;#39;s in these</text>
  <text start="398.57" dur="3.24">blanks that the court blanked out the</text>
  <text start="400.789" dur="3.06">court did the right thing it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="401.81" dur="3.87">supposed to reveal that but once you</text>
  <text start="403.849" dur="4.111">start doing oversight constitutional</text>
  <text start="405.68" dur="5.13">oversight those blanks go away to</text>
  <text start="407.96" dur="5.07">Congress and we will know shortly who</text>
  <text start="410.81" dur="4.43">the private contractors were that were</text>
  <text start="413.03" dur="5.939">allowed to break the law by the FBI when</text>
  <text start="415.24" dur="6.22">Comey goes to visit President Trump at</text>
  <text start="418.969" dur="4.141">the White House about the Flynn case and</text>
  <text start="421.46" dur="4.709">all that remember the president is</text>
  <text start="423.11" dur="6.119">president at that point there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="426.169" dur="4.861">reason for Comey to be doing anything if</text>
  <text start="429.229" dur="4.53">the president wanted to meet with him he</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="4.379">didn&amp;#39;t have to go he went and he told</text>
  <text start="433.759" dur="2.13">the president for example about the</text>
  <text start="435.409" dur="3.271">dossier</text>
  <text start="435.889" dur="5.34">now why would an FBI director tell a</text>
  <text start="438.68" dur="4.5">president about this salacious document</text>
  <text start="441.229" dur="4.651">which Comey admitted under oath there</text>
  <text start="443.18" dur="4.32">was no proof for no validity he was</text>
  <text start="445.88" dur="3.759">playing J Edgar Hoover he was</text>
  <text start="447.5" dur="3.789">blackmailing the president United States</text>
  <text start="449.639" dur="3.391">he was saying I know all about this now</text>
  <text start="451.289" dur="3.541">I&amp;#39;m not gonna say anything about it of</text>
  <text start="453.03" dur="3.78">course of course if it ever gets out</text>
  <text start="454.83" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s just gonna be awful do you want me</text>
  <text start="456.81" dur="7.109">to stay in my job I mean this Comey is a</text>
  <text start="460.11" dur="5.97">person so devoid of a moral compass he</text>
  <text start="463.919" dur="3.93">describes himself as Thomas Becket I</text>
  <text start="466.08" dur="3.809">said somebody the other day he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="467.849" dur="4.5">Thomas Becket he&amp;#39;s the assassin Henry</text>
  <text start="469.889" dur="4.62">the second who killed Thomas Becket that</text>
  <text start="472.349" dur="4.861">tsukkomi is he&amp;#39;s an assassin he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="474.509" dur="6.72">political assassin so when you follow</text>
  <text start="477.21" dur="6.509">the money of fusion GPS if the DNC in</text>
  <text start="481.229" dur="6.06">the Hillary Clinton campaign paid fusion</text>
  <text start="483.719" dur="5.551">GPS and that was part of the dossier</text>
  <text start="487.289" dur="4.081">that went to the FISA Court and it also</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="5.19">was marketed through the journalistic</text>
  <text start="491.37" dur="5.639">community some people think that fusion</text>
  <text start="494.46" dur="5.669">GPS was paying a lot of left-wing</text>
  <text start="497.009" dur="5.34">journalists who became propagandist to</text>
  <text start="500.129" dur="5.75">add these things to their stories have</text>
  <text start="502.349" dur="6.57">you heard that yeah well I think the the</text>
  <text start="505.879" dur="5.71">understandable storyline that fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="508.919" dur="5.401">paid journalists to then go out and tell</text>
  <text start="511.589" dur="4.08">a story is the complete antithesis of</text>
  <text start="514.32" dur="3.18">American journalism in the First</text>
  <text start="515.669" dur="4.41">Amendment we don&amp;#39;t do that in this</text>
  <text start="517.5" dur="4.05">country but if they did and it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="520.079" dur="3.181">clear that they paid a lot of money to a</text>
  <text start="521.55" dur="2.849">lot of people among whom were some</text>
  <text start="523.26" dur="3.63">journalists there&amp;#39;s just no doubt about</text>
  <text start="524.399" dur="4.231">that that&amp;#39;s a scandal of immense</text>
  <text start="526.89" dur="3.689">proportion for the American journalism</text>
  <text start="528.63" dur="3.81">community who seem to care little about</text>
  <text start="530.579" dur="3.361">that the only thing the American</text>
  <text start="532.44" dur="3.81">journalism community seems to care about</text>
  <text start="533.94" dur="4.38">is destroying Jeff Donald Trump it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="536.25" dur="3.99">fascinating to me that the people cared</text>
  <text start="538.32" dur="3.93">so deeply about governmental</text>
  <text start="540.24" dur="4.5">institutions in Watergate could care</text>
  <text start="542.25" dur="5.22">less about them now because it&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="544.74" dur="5.49">Republican who&amp;#39;s being destroyed</text>
  <text start="547.47" dur="4.92">this is this is this is as bad as it</text>
  <text start="550.23" dur="4.41">gets when you have the government the</text>
  <text start="552.39" dur="4.5">FBI and the DOJ being absolutely</text>
  <text start="554.64" dur="3.569">corrupted because of their motivations</text>
  <text start="556.89" dur="3.99">and when you have the journalistic</text>
  <text start="558.209" dur="4.201">community being bought it seems to me</text>
  <text start="560.88" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s pretty bad for all the</text>
  <text start="562.41" dur="7.109">institutions involved and journalism is</text>
  <text start="565.56" dur="5.969">now below Congress in terms of approval</text>
  <text start="569.519" dur="5.76">ratings this is not going to help them</text>
  <text start="571.529" dur="5.971">there have been rumors about the reason</text>
  <text start="575.279" dur="5.911">GPS fought the House Intelligence</text>
  <text start="577.5" dur="5.46">Committee subpoena was to prevent not</text>
  <text start="581.19" dur="4.08">who their clients were that</text>
  <text start="582.96" dur="5.04">nonsense they were protecting the people</text>
  <text start="585.27" dur="6">that they paid and it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious</text>
  <text start="588" dur="4.83">that fusion GPS they can pay anybody</text>
  <text start="591.27" dur="3.18">they want for information they&amp;#39;re not a</text>
  <text start="592.83" dur="3.06">government agency they&amp;#39;re not buying if</text>
  <text start="594.45" dur="3.03">they want to pay for information and</text>
  <text start="595.89" dur="3.42">they think it&amp;#39;s truthful or not truthful</text>
  <text start="597.48" dur="4.74">but they want it they can do that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599.31" dur="5.13">clear that the reason they tried to</text>
  <text start="602.22" dur="3.84">protect and they went to court to try</text>
  <text start="604.44" dur="4.47">and stop the house subpoena but they</text>
  <text start="606.06" dur="5.22">lost in front of Judge Richard Leon was</text>
  <text start="608.91" dur="5.34">to protect to whom they were paying</text>
  <text start="611.28" dur="4.41">money to get information I have read</text>
  <text start="614.25" dur="3.03">reports I don&amp;#39;t know whether they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="615.69" dur="4.8">true or not that they paid a number of</text>
  <text start="617.28" dur="5.61">journalists to spread information about</text>
  <text start="620.49" dur="4.05">the dossier it&amp;#39;s not going to be long</text>
  <text start="622.89" dur="2.43">though because the house now has all of</text>
  <text start="624.54" dur="3.75">those records</text>
  <text start="625.32" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;ve been reviewed and Devon Nunez</text>
  <text start="628.29" dur="3.3">the chairman of the House Intelligence</text>
  <text start="629.31" dur="4.8">Committee has now and will start next</text>
  <text start="631.59" dur="5.43">week briefing individual members of the</text>
  <text start="634.11" dur="4.68">house in closed sessions about what</text>
  <text start="637.02" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;ve discovered and I&amp;#39;m sure that</text>
  <text start="638.79" dur="5.85">what will leak out is who Fuzion GPS</text>
  <text start="641.49" dur="5.43">paid fusion gps by the way is really a</text>
  <text start="644.64" dur="3.68">joke they wrote an op-ed piece in The</text>
  <text start="646.92" dur="3.27">New York Times about a week ago</text>
  <text start="648.32" dur="4.27">criticizing the house committee and</text>
  <text start="650.19" dur="3.66">saying release all the transcripts and</text>
  <text start="652.59" dur="2.76">everything of course everything that was</text>
  <text start="653.85" dur="4.71">released was blanked out because it had</text>
  <text start="655.35" dur="6.6">information that they wanted protected I</text>
  <text start="658.56" dur="5.79">think that that what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s quite</text>
  <text start="661.95" dur="4.74">clear is that they were a private</text>
  <text start="664.35" dur="3.93">intelligence service they sold their</text>

  <text start="780.06" dur="8.79">what they did which was part of a scheme</text>
  <text start="783.17" dur="7.33">which began in the year 2016 was to try</text>

  <text start="835.65" dur="6.18">people there are some real heroes in</text>
  <text start="838.35" dur="5.55">this story and part of it is how you</text>
  <text start="841.83" dur="4.74">defeat these competing narratives you</text>
  <text start="843.9" dur="4.679">will recall that first there&amp;#39;s the story</text>
  <text start="846.57" dur="4.29">about the dossier the so-called Jeep</text>

  <text start="868.77" dur="5.64">of a sudden became something that people</text>
  <text start="872.19" dur="5.58">got worried about on the Democratic side</text>
  <text start="874.41" dur="5.7">and on the protect the Clinton side then</text>
  <text start="877.77" dur="4.47">all of a sudden when the when they do</text>
  <text start="880.11" dur="3.96">the dossier got even stronger and</text>
  <text start="882.24" dur="4.74">stronger as a result of the knowledge</text>
  <text start="884.07" dur="5.37">about Bruce or its involvement the</text>
  <text start="886.98" dur="4.56">dialogue shifted and then it became that</text>
  <text start="889.44" dur="5.01">the dossier really wasn&amp;#39;t important</text>

  <text start="912.12" dur="6.48">told mi6 in London these narratives have</text>
  <text start="915.75" dur="7.14">developed because the facts are now so</text>
  <text start="918.6" dur="6.66">strong that there was a brazen plot to</text>
  <text start="922.89" dur="4.56">exonerate Hillary Clinton and then if</text>

  <text start="930.84" dur="6.39">this is what they had been forced to do</text>
  <text start="934.34" dur="6.04">one of the heroes in this entire story</text>
  <text start="937.23" dur="6.06">is Admiral Mike Rogers the head of the</text>

  <text start="984.72" dur="5.88">which is supposed to be kept secret but</text>
  <text start="987.72" dur="4.86">wasn&amp;#39;t in this case because of the</text>

  <text start="1045.62" dur="3.63">them which are not true he said I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1047.42" dur="8.16">going to the court I&amp;#39;m going to tell the</text>
  <text start="1049.25" dur="10.26">court Rogers goes to the court on his</text>
  <text start="1055.58" dur="6.57">own and informs the court about these</text>
  <text start="1059.51" dur="5.01">problems now prior to him being able to</text>
  <text start="1062.15" dur="4.44">do that the Justice Department and the</text>
  <text start="1064.52" dur="3.75">FBI learned about what he&amp;#39;s done about</text>
  <text start="1066.59" dur="5.55">the audit and what he&amp;#39;s discovered and</text>
  <text start="1068.27" dur="5.73">so they go to the court first to inform</text>
  <text start="1072.14" dur="4.7">the court that they have discovered</text>
  <text start="1074" dur="4.86">these problems with illegal activity</text>
  <text start="1076.84" dur="4.21">doesn&amp;#39;t make any difference it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="1078.86" dur="5.85">late the court now knows what has</text>
  <text start="1081.05" dur="7.47">happened so he goes to the court they go</text>
  <text start="1084.71" dur="6.6">to the court and then in April of 2016</text>
  <text start="1088.52" dur="5.13">the FISA Court issues this 99 page</text>
  <text start="1091.31" dur="4.17">opinion which I&amp;#39;ll bet you didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1093.65" dur="2.69">know about until I talked about it this</text>
  <text start="1095.48" dur="5.1">morning</text>
  <text start="1096.34" dur="6.94">this opinion describes illegal activity</text>
  <text start="1100.58" dur="6.63">by the FBI illegal activity by</text>
  <text start="1103.28" dur="6.36">contractors and it calls it the improper</text>
  <text start="1107.21" dur="4.83">disclosure of raw intelligence about</text>
  <text start="1109.64" dur="5.31">Americans to unauthorized individuals</text>
  <text start="1112.04" dur="5.78">all of those things that the bureau did</text>
  <text start="1114.95" dur="5.599">and the contractors were crimes</text>
  <text start="1117.82" dur="4.709">now you wouldn&amp;#39;t think this is a public</text>
  <text start="1120.549" dur="3.781">document now it&amp;#39;s been Declassified</text>
  <text start="1122.529" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;ve not seen a single story about</text>

  <text start="1130.169" dur="9.31">remember Rodgers knows all about this</text>
  <text start="1136.139" dur="8.41">before the election so as soon as the</text>
  <text start="1139.479" dur="6.63">election is held Rogers determined to</text>
  <text start="1144.549" dur="3.901">determines that since there is now a</text>
  <text start="1146.109" dur="5.94">president-elect who has been spied upon</text>
  <text start="1148.45" dur="7.49">he knows that Trump was the subject of a</text>
  <text start="1152.049" dur="7.771">plot so Admiral Rogers goes to visit</text>
  <text start="1155.94" dur="10.15">President Trump president elect Trump in</text>
  <text start="1159.82" dur="9.539">New York in November of 2016 on the 17th</text>

  <text start="1172.21" dur="4.38">that briefing the very next day that</text>
  <text start="1175.269" dur="3.931">president-elect Trump</text>
  <text start="1176.59" dur="5.85">moves his entire staff out of Trump</text>

  <text start="1182.44" dur="4.53">Golf Club is and that&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="1184.239" dur="6.39">transition team stays until Trump Tower</text>
  <text start="1186.97" dur="5.73">is debugged what Admiral Rogers did was</text>
  <text start="1190.629" dur="3.99">and this is why the president said that</text>
  <text start="1192.7" dur="5.37">President Obama had wiretapped him</text>
  <text start="1194.619" dur="5.461">Rogers on that day November 17th briefed</text>

  <text start="1204.399" dur="6.99">Court court earlier in the year and the</text>
  <text start="1208.359" dur="7.91">president knew what had happened at that</text>
  <text start="1211.389" dur="7.321">point now interestingly enough when the</text>
  <text start="1216.269" dur="6.431">outgoing administration found that</text>
  <text start="1218.71" dur="5.61">Admiral Rogers had gone to New York the</text>

  <text start="1240.46" dur="4.98">late I&amp;#39;m not gonna fire Admiral Rogers</text>
  <text start="1242.559" dur="6.18">because if I do that&amp;#39;ll be the only</text>
  <text start="1245.44" dur="6.119">story about my last days in office so</text>
  <text start="1248.739" dur="4.861">you can forget it and Rogers is there</text>
  <text start="1251.559" dur="4.531">to this day and when this story is</text>
  <text start="1253.6" dur="5.13">written when it&amp;#39;s all over the great</text>

  <text start="1799.8" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re left with is this nagging</text>
  <text start="1802.2" dur="5.37">sensation that all of a sudden these</text>
  <text start="1804.66" dur="5.67">really great investigators lose all of</text>
  <text start="1807.57" dur="5.52">their skills and nobody talks to anybody</text>
  <text start="1810.33" dur="4.59">about uranium one the other thing is</text>
  <text start="1813.09" dur="3.45">this everybody always says in defense of</text>
  <text start="1814.92" dur="4.23">Hillary well she was only one of nine</text>
  <text start="1816.54" dur="4.17">there were nine agencies but they forget</text>
  <text start="1819.15" dur="3.45">the one month the most important fact of</text>

  <text start="1825.6" dur="4.17">bought she wasn&amp;#39;t gonna vote no she</text>
  <text start="1828" dur="3.99">wasn&amp;#39;t she knew about the bribery that</text>
  <text start="1829.77" dur="4.38">was going on her husband was involved in</text>
  <text start="1831.99" dur="4.41">it she could have stopped the uranium</text>
  <text start="1834.15" dur="4.8">one sale with one vote that&amp;#39;s all it</text>
  <text start="1836.4" dur="5.37">takes in Sophia&amp;#39;s if one member of</text>

  <text start="1846.78" dur="4.73">that she was one of nine it&amp;#39;s that she</text>
  <text start="1848.85" dur="5.94">was one of nine and she didn&amp;#39;t stop it</text>
