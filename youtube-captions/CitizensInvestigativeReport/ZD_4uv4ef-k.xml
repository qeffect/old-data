  <text start="757.66" dur="4.38">no obstruction and that&amp;#39;s the way it is</text>
  <text start="760.75" dur="2.91">and I know a lot of people were very</text>
  <text start="762.04" dur="3.33">disappointed but they knew the real</text>
  <text start="763.66" dur="3.9">answer you know when the Democrats go</text>
  <text start="765.37" dur="4.2">behind the scenes and they go into a</text>

  <text start="769.57" dur="6.33">talk they laugh because they know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="771.82" dur="6.24">all a big scam a big hoax and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="775.9" dur="4.11">called politics but this is dirty</text>
  <text start="778.06" dur="4.5">politics and this is actually treason</text>
  <text start="780.01" dur="6.48">it&amp;#39;s a very bad thing that people have</text>
  <text start="782.56" dur="6.66">done back to the origins of exactly</text>
  <text start="786.49" dur="5.64">where this all started because this was</text>
  <text start="789.22" dur="4.38">an illegal witch-hunt and everybody knew</text>
  <text start="792.13" dur="3.81">it and they knew it too</text>
  <text start="793.6" dur="4.77">and they got caught and what they did</text>
  <text start="795.94" dur="5.06">was treason what they did was terrible</text>
  <text start="798.37" dur="5.31">what they did was against our</text>
  <text start="801" dur="6.1">Constitution and everything we stand for</text>
  <text start="803.68" dur="6.54">so hopefully that will happen there is a</text>
