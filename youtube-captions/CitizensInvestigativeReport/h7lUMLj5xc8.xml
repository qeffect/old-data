  <text start="356.2" dur="4.68">affair with Peter Strock yeah and they</text>
  <text start="359.26" dur="3.24">saw a bunch of text messages back and</text>
  <text start="360.88" dur="3.87">forth about how much they hated Trump</text>
  <text start="362.5" dur="4.26">and I&amp;#39;ll go into all that but basically</text>
  <text start="364.75" dur="5.16">these people are just absolutely up to</text>
  <text start="366.76" dur="6.06">no good they all conspire the collusion</text>
  <text start="369.91" dur="4.62">is with Russia well obviously it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="372.82" dur="3.36">be through uranium one deal and I&amp;#39;ll go</text>

  <text start="376.18" dur="8.22">maybe it&amp;#39;s if you guys want me to but</text>
  <text start="378.96" dur="7.9">basically it&amp;#39;s just so convoluted these</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="6.21">people have conspired and it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="386.86" dur="6.69">shown in their text messages so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.61" dur="4.95">see try to go back here so basically</text>
  <text start="393.55" dur="6.03">this guy was dismissed this struck I was</text>
  <text start="395.56" dur="5.25">dismissed because because of his anti</text>
  <text start="399.58" dur="2.4">Trump sentiment in his</text>
  <text start="400.81" dur="3.359">messages well they were more than</text>
  <text start="401.98" dur="5.01">anti-trump sentiments they were like f</text>
  <text start="404.169" dur="5.071">him and I mean I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing here</text>
  <text start="406.99" dur="3.99">what else you know that they were gonna</text>
  <text start="409.24" dur="3.45">have an inch it like he was worried you</text>
  <text start="410.98" dur="4.47">know before because you know you know</text>
  <text start="412.69" dur="4.71">the bottom line is they didn&amp;#39;t expect</text>
  <text start="415.45" dur="2.939">Hillary Clinton to win they didn&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="417.4" dur="2.97">they were gonna have to be cover in</text>
  <text start="418.389" dur="4.411">there but so basically they paid forth</text>
  <text start="420.37" dur="4.98">and you&amp;#39;re gonna find how it&amp;#39;s even more</text>
  <text start="422.8" dur="7.619">awful that Hillary Clinton paid a lawyer</text>
  <text start="425.35" dur="7.08">who paid fusion GPS with DNC money the</text>
  <text start="430.419" dur="5.161">DNC&amp;#39;s involved the Democratic National</text>

  <text start="435.58" dur="5.309">to create this dossier and it turns out</text>
  <text start="438.79" dur="5.25">to be completely fake okay it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="440.889" dur="5.761">didn&amp;#39;t happen nothing so this is why</text>
  <text start="444.04" dur="4.14">people are calling for the Special</text>

  <text start="685.12" dur="4.47">developing news today and this week</text>
  <text start="687.25" dur="5.4">Congressman Jim Jordan and congressman</text>
  <text start="689.59" dur="3.54">Ron De Santis all right gentlemen good</text>
  <text start="692.65" dur="3.06">evening</text>
  <text start="693.13" dur="6.33">now you guys have been front and center</text>
  <text start="695.71" dur="6.9">in this effort to find out what is going</text>
  <text start="699.46" dur="6.42">on in Congress and here we are almost a</text>
  <text start="702.61" dur="5.07">year into Muller&amp;#39;s investigation and the</text>
  <text start="705.88" dur="3.48">only thing we&amp;#39;re finding out about is</text>
  <text start="707.68" dur="6.21">that if there was a criminal conspiracy</text>
  <text start="709.36" dur="6.48">or a cabal of any sort it is on the part</text>
  <text start="713.89" dur="4.41">of people within justice and the FBI and</text>
  <text start="715.84" dur="4.2">my viewers guys we&amp;#39;ve been watching you</text>
  <text start="718.3" dur="4.89">for months and you are very aggressive</text>
  <text start="720.04" dur="7.23">but my viewers want to know what now</text>
  <text start="723.19" dur="6.84">what are the next steps Jim tell me well</text>
  <text start="727.27" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re going to subpoena Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="730.03" dur="3.96">subpoena Peter struck and first of all</text>
  <text start="732.13" dur="4.11">judge your opening was was perfect that</text>
  <text start="733.99" dur="3.99">lays out the entire story Bruce or Peter</text>
  <text start="736.24" dur="4.86">struck are central to this so subpoena</text>
  <text start="737.98" dur="5.55">and Remicade Bruce struck Bruce or his</text>
  <text start="741.1" dur="3.87">wife and Lisa Paige and I also think the</text>
  <text start="743.53" dur="2.52">chief of staff to the FBI needs to be</text>
  <text start="744.97" dur="2.67">brought in so let&amp;#39;s get all the</text>
  <text start="746.05" dur="3.66">documents let&amp;#39;s bring him in for</text>
  <text start="747.64" dur="3.51">depositions and let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s put them on</text>
  <text start="749.71" dur="3.71">the same witness stand that Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="751.15" dur="4.59">said on last week and McCann and and</text>
  <text start="753.42" dur="4.09">session said on a few weeks ago and</text>
  <text start="755.74" dur="2.97">asked them the same tough questions so</text>
  <text start="757.51" dur="2.97">the American people can get the answers</text>
  <text start="758.71" dur="3.51">but they we need the documents and we</text>
  <text start="760.48" dur="3.39">needed to depose them and then we can</text>
  <text start="762.22" dur="3.42">subpoena all those individuals all right</text>
  <text start="763.87" dur="3.33">congressman DeSantis how long is that</text>
  <text start="765.64" dur="2.28">going to take with my viewers are</text>
  <text start="767.2" dur="2.88">listening</text>
  <text start="767.92" dur="4.56">look they hear you guys they know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="770.08" dur="5.22">both very aggressive what is going to</text>
  <text start="772.48" dur="4.29">happen well Jimmy and I are ready right</text>
  <text start="775.3" dur="4.29">now so we want to get it done very</text>
  <text start="776.77" dur="5.76">quickly because judge this is only these</text>
  <text start="779.59" dur="5.28">people are kept get it done we we should</text>
  <text start="782.53" dur="4.11">look I&amp;#39;m there if we can do that we need</text>
  <text start="784.87" dur="3.06">to we need to get support from the</text>
  <text start="786.64" dur="3.06">chairman of the committees in the</text>
  <text start="787.93" dur="4.44">leadership I think we actually are gonna</text>
  <text start="789.7" dur="4.23">get that but unfortunately Jimmy and I</text>
  <text start="792.37" dur="3.33">can&amp;#39;t just do depositions on our own so</text>
  <text start="793.93" dur="2.88">we&amp;#39;re working that and I think we can do</text>
  <text start="795.7" dur="2.55">it but here&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="796.81" dur="3.18">all those guys need to be held</text>
  <text start="798.25" dur="4.05">accountable for it they did but it needs</text>
  <text start="799.99" dur="4.05">to be exposed because this goes to the</text>
  <text start="802.3" dur="4.11">heart of whether this whole</text>
  <text start="804.04" dur="4.5">investigation was legitimate from the</text>
  <text start="806.41" dur="3.929">start we still don&amp;#39;t know that the</text>
  <text start="808.54" dur="4.02">government won&amp;#39;t admit whether they paid</text>
  <text start="810.339" dur="3.901">Christopher steel for the dossier how</text>
  <text start="812.56" dur="4.26">the Russia things started whether they</text>
  <text start="814.24" dur="4.56">used it to surveil Trump Associates and</text>
  <text start="816.82" dur="4.53">so yeah this stuff needs to be brought</text>
  <text start="818.8" dur="4.77">to light with all due respect but the</text>
  <text start="821.35" dur="4.049">Deputy Attorney General rod Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="823.57" dur="3.69">looks like a deer in the headlights</text>
  <text start="825.399" dur="3.511">right when he&amp;#39;s trying to give an answer</text>
  <text start="827.26" dur="4.07">as to why he&amp;#39;s not giving you anything</text>
  <text start="828.91" dur="5.82">he&amp;#39;s not giving you anything</text>
  <text start="831.33" dur="5.59">well we actually haven&amp;#39;t shown as to his</text>
  <text start="834.73" dur="4.31">credit is going to pursue and I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="836.92" dur="5.22">very supportive of this as Jimmy will be</text>
  <text start="839.04" dur="5.38">contempt of Congress on Rosenstein and</text>
  <text start="842.14" dur="4.259">on the FBI director if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="844.42" dur="3.66">produce the answers to those very simple</text>
  <text start="846.399" dur="3.211">questions you send them a letter you say</text>
  <text start="848.08" dur="3.509">show up they don&amp;#39;t show up then you</text>
  <text start="849.61" dur="4.71">subpoena them all right and then they</text>
  <text start="851.589" dur="3.631">they come in do they take the fifth what</text>
  <text start="854.32" dur="3.329">happens then</text>
  <text start="855.22" dur="4.83">well I think we can vote online you know</text>
  <text start="857.649" dur="4.351">before we go for the arrest at the end</text>
  <text start="860.05" dur="3.21">of the year and we should do that and I</text>
  <text start="862" dur="5.01">think that it would pass overwhelmingly</text>
  <text start="863.26" dur="5.49">what do you think Jim Congress I think I</text>
  <text start="867.01" dur="3.48">think we bring him in and check chairman</text>
  <text start="868.75" dur="3.3">now you&amp;#39;re fine chairman Goodlatte has</text>
  <text start="870.49" dur="3.15">told us he is going to subpoena those</text>
  <text start="872.05" dur="3.24">individuals bring him in with the</text>
  <text start="873.64" dur="2.79">documents to pose them and put them on</text>
  <text start="875.29" dur="2.07">the witness stand if they take the fifth</text>
  <text start="876.43" dur="2.7">they take the fifth</text>
  <text start="877.36" dur="3.87">but Ron is exactly right there are two</text>
  <text start="879.13" dur="3.3">fundamental questions did the FBI pay</text>
  <text start="881.23" dur="3.51">Christopher Steele the author of the</text>
  <text start="882.43" dur="3.45">dossier and was the dossier the basis</text>
  <text start="884.74" dur="2.64">for getting warrants to spy on people</text>
  <text start="885.88" dur="3.72">associated with President Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="887.38" dur="4.17">campaign if the answer is yes to either</text>
  <text start="889.6" dur="3.72">of those questions then this is as</text>
  <text start="891.55" dur="3.84">terrible as it gets as long as it gets</text>
  <text start="893.32" dur="3.93">this is and should never happen in the</text>
  <text start="895.39" dur="3.99">United States of America that&amp;#39;s why this</text>
  <text start="897.25" dur="3.45">is so fundamental it is fundamental I</text>
  <text start="899.38" dur="2.94">can&amp;#39;t agree with you more both these</text>
  <text start="900.7" dur="3.66">people are still getting a check from us</text>
  <text start="902.32" dur="3.66">not only should they not be working for</text>
  <text start="904.36" dur="3.03">us in getting a check I mean they should</text>
  <text start="905.98" dur="4.349">be as far as I&amp;#39;m concerned</text>
  <text start="907.39" dur="4.41">indicted if Jim Comey and Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="910.329" dur="3.661">couldn&amp;#39;t put together a grand jury and</text>
  <text start="911.8" dur="4.56">Hillary Clinton then you know at least</text>
  <text start="913.99" dur="4.469">at this point Jeff Sessions should start</text>
  <text start="916.36" dur="3.479">putting together a grand jury on this</text>
  <text start="918.459" dur="3.841">stuff let me ask you a question in</text>
