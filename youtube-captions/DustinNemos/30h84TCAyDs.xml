  <text start="0.17" dur="5.2">good afternoon guys this is Sydney aka</text>
  <text start="3.3" dur="3.209">the bass southern belle and there have</text>
  <text start="5.37" dur="3.12">been quite a few interesting updates</text>
  <text start="6.509" dur="4.081">pertaining to the very large and</text>
  <text start="8.49" dur="4.319">prominent topic of free speech that I</text>
  <text start="10.59" dur="4.35">want to discuss today of course we</text>
  <text start="12.809" dur="5.071">understand as Americans that free speech</text>
  <text start="14.94" dur="5.339">is the predominant and foundational</text>
  <text start="17.88" dur="4.59">philosophy on which our country&amp;#39;s ideas</text>
  <text start="20.279" dur="5.221">are established we understand how</text>
  <text start="22.47" dur="4.92">integral it has to be to preserve free</text>
  <text start="25.5" dur="3.779">expression of discourse whether or not</text>
  <text start="27.39" dur="2.549">those ideas are disagreed with or</text>
  <text start="29.279" dur="2.91">anything else</text>
  <text start="29.939" dur="4.291">the ability to freely exchange ideas is</text>
  <text start="32.189" dur="3.811">a foundational cornerstone of American</text>
  <text start="34.23" dur="4.14">philosophy so much so that George</text>
  <text start="36" dur="4.739">Washington himself stated that if free</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="3.99">speech is taken away dumb and silent we</text>
  <text start="40.739" dur="3.66">may be led like sheep to the slaughter</text>
  <text start="42.36" dur="3.87">this was understood by the foundational</text>
  <text start="44.399" dur="3.66">thinkers during the American Revolution</text>
  <text start="46.23" dur="3.54">and throughout American history we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="48.059" dur="3.89">understood the significance of free</text>
  <text start="49.77" dur="5.4">speech and why that is such a</text>
  <text start="51.949" dur="4.991">significant tenant in our own culture</text>
  <text start="55.17" dur="4.139">that we have to preserve and we also</text>
  <text start="56.94" dur="4.23">know of course that that is an idea that</text>
  <text start="59.309" dur="4.02">being free speech and the free</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="3.72">expression of ideas is something that is</text>
  <text start="63.329" dur="3.661">of course under vehement and</text>
  <text start="64.89" dur="3.479">antagonistic attack by the left by the</text>
  <text start="66.99" dur="3.419">Democratic Party and by those who</text>
  <text start="68.369" dur="4.141">attempt to systematically silence sensor</text>
  <text start="70.409" dur="3.361">and oppress anyone who disagrees with</text>
  <text start="72.51" dur="3.359">them and we know that this has been a</text>
  <text start="73.77" dur="4.68">continual problem especially throughout</text>
  <text start="75.869" dur="3.961">the last two or three years so the</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="2.76">interesting thing about this is that I</text>
  <text start="79.83" dur="3.78">see frequently presented the argument</text>
  <text start="81.21" dur="4.76">that social media sites predominantly</text>
  <text start="83.61" dur="5.45">those being Facebook YouTube Twitter and</text>
  <text start="85.97" dur="5.62">similar sites have the capacity to</text>
  <text start="89.06" dur="4.66">systematically censor those who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="91.59" dur="4.099">follow a politically correct agenda up</text>
  <text start="93.72" dur="4.38">on the basis of those corporations being</text>
  <text start="95.689" dur="4.331">private corporations or private</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="3.839">companies a lot of people say that they</text>
  <text start="100.02" dur="4.26">are s essentially immune to the same</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="4.68">constitutional restraints that they</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="4.08">should be restrained by under the</text>
  <text start="106.619" dur="3.331">argument that they&amp;#39;re merely a private</text>
  <text start="108.36" dur="4.11">corporation and therefore they possess</text>
  <text start="109.95" dur="4.65">the right to run that corporation how</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="5.07">they will now the problem with this is</text>
  <text start="114.6" dur="4.619">that illegally releasing private</text>
  <text start="117.54" dur="3.719">information on behalf of the users</text>
  <text start="119.219" dur="3.72">without their consent is not within the</text>
  <text start="121.259" dur="4.64">jurisdiction of a private company and we</text>
  <text start="122.939" dur="5.19">understand this because just recently</text>
  <text start="125.899" dur="4.301">interestingly enough the Federal Trade</text>
  <text start="128.129" dur="4.391">Commission charged Facebook a five</text>
  <text start="130.2" dur="5.05">billion dollar fine do</text>
  <text start="132.52" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s association and consent for the</text>
  <text start="135.25" dur="3.6">Cambridge analytical scandal which was</text>
  <text start="136.96" dur="5">of course an instance in which that</text>
  <text start="138.85" dur="6.72">corporation was monitoring and</text>
  <text start="141.96" dur="5.83">essentially using Facebook users</text>
  <text start="145.57" dur="3.84">information without their awareness or</text>
  <text start="147.79" dur="3.27">their consent so we should of course</text>
  <text start="149.41" dur="3.81">understand how significant this is in</text>
  <text start="151.06" dur="4.23">terms of a travesty of justice and a</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="3.03">free speech and the First Amendment this</text>
  <text start="155.29" dur="3.27">is not something we should consider</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="4.5">acceptable under any way shape or form</text>
  <text start="158.56" dur="3.36">and it is of course not something that</text>
  <text start="160.75" dur="2.73">should be excused under the guise of</text>
  <text start="161.92" dur="4.71">Facebook being considered a private</text>
  <text start="163.48" dur="5.48">corporation because Facebook YouTube and</text>
  <text start="166.63" dur="6">Twitter are not only in possession of</text>
  <text start="168.96" dur="5.95">the primary methods by which billions of</text>
  <text start="172.63" dur="4.74">people communicate but they have been</text>
  <text start="174.91" dur="5.01">known to demonstrate a significant bias</text>
  <text start="177.37" dur="4.17">politically and since they&amp;#39;re someone</text>
  <text start="179.92" dur="2.88">simply upon the basis of a political</text>
  <text start="181.54" dur="2.37">disagreement and this is not something</text>
  <text start="182.8" dur="2.58">that should ever be considered</text>
  <text start="183.91" dur="3.18">acceptable but especially here in the</text>
  <text start="185.38" dur="3.18">United States in which free speech is</text>
  <text start="187.09" dur="3.63">such an important tenet to our</text>
  <text start="188.56" dur="4.32">philosophy but in addition to that</text>
  <text start="190.72" dur="3.9">another very interesting occurrence that</text>
  <text start="192.88" dur="3.51">has just happened over the last few days</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="3.66">is that the Justice Department has</text>
  <text start="196.39" dur="4.74">actually announced an investigation into</text>
  <text start="198.28" dur="4.26">social media sites due to the suspicion</text>
  <text start="201.13" dur="3.21">that those particular sites have</text>
  <text start="202.54" dur="3.69">essentially strangled economic</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="3.72">competition and the free market by</text>
  <text start="206.23" dur="4.17">establishing a monopoly upon free speech</text>
  <text start="208.06" dur="4.5">and upon communication in general so</text>
  <text start="210.4" dur="3.57">this is absolutely huge to think that we</text>
  <text start="212.56" dur="2.73">have now reached a point in which the</text>
  <text start="213.97" dur="3.18">federal government itself is</text>
  <text start="215.29" dur="3.51">acknowledging the fact that this is a</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="3.33">significant enough problem that these</text>
  <text start="218.8" dur="3.9">corporations and social media engines</text>
  <text start="220.48" dur="3.96">and sites have actually established such</text>
  <text start="222.7" dur="7.05">a significant monopoly that they are</text>
  <text start="224.44" dur="7.79">systematically censoring billions of</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="4.32">people potentially simply for</text>
  <text start="232.23" dur="3.55">disagreeing with their political</text>
  <text start="234.07" dur="3.48">ideology and upon the basis of wrong</text>
  <text start="235.78" dur="3.45">think so this is of course something</text>
  <text start="237.55" dur="2.88">that we have to discuss and have to</text>
  <text start="239.23" dur="2.61">acknowledge and it&amp;#39;s gotten to the</text>
  <text start="240.43" dur="3.15">degree of severity that the federal</text>
  <text start="241.84" dur="4.32">government itself is suggesting here</text>
  <text start="243.58" dur="4.14">that these corporations must be held</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="3.72">accountable for what they have done in</text>
  <text start="247.72" dur="3.54">terms of the censorship especially of</text>
  <text start="249.88" dur="2.79">those on the right weighing those that</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="3.69">are moderately conservative and others</text>
  <text start="252.67" dur="5.01">who have done nothing to be censored or</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="4.28">banned myself included so many people</text>
  <text start="257.68" dur="4.08">have been subject to this and of course</text>
  <text start="259.23" dur="4.18">the problem has now become severe enough</text>
  <text start="261.76" dur="3.17">that there are many people that have</text>
  <text start="263.41" dur="4.099">actually had their entire bank</text>
  <text start="264.93" dur="4.799">shut down as a result of wrong think as</text>
  <text start="267.509" dur="4.641">a result of possessing a politically</text>
  <text start="269.729" dur="5.371">incorrect opinion those being of course</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="5.44">oftentimes many moderate right-wingers</text>
  <text start="275.1" dur="4.11">such as the leader of the proud boys the</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="3.78">leader of the American guard and several</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="4.56">other individuals who simply were found</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="5.07">guilty of possessing an opinion that the</text>
  <text start="283.77" dur="5.25">establishment does not like however I</text>
  <text start="286.44" dur="4.41">like to think here that President Trump</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="4.32">is establishing something significant in</text>
  <text start="290.85" dur="4.74">terms of fighting back against the</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="4.02">totalitarian censorship that so many</text>
  <text start="295.59" dur="3.99">people are currently being subject to</text>
  <text start="297.36" dur="4.38">and I&amp;#39;ve had this in mind since he</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="4.05">himself actually launched a website with</text>
  <text start="301.74" dur="4.08">the White House in which they allowed</text>
  <text start="303.63" dur="4.5">people to go to that website and express</text>
  <text start="305.82" dur="4.71">their experiences being censored and</text>
  <text start="308.13" dur="4.44">describe exactly what occurred what they</text>
  <text start="310.53" dur="3.569">were allegedly censored for and to</text>
  <text start="312.57" dur="3.33">provide evidence as to how they were</text>
  <text start="314.099" dur="4.29">unjustifiably censored without any</text>
  <text start="315.9" dur="4.44">actual logical cause or for any reason</text>
  <text start="318.389" dur="5.4">that was actually logical in any way</text>
  <text start="320.34" dur="5.13">shape or form so I like to think that we</text>
  <text start="323.789" dur="3.871">are headed in a direction right now in</text>
  <text start="325.47" dur="5.4">which this will be a pivotal point in</text>
  <text start="327.66" dur="5.16">American history in which it will be the</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="3.72">people of the United States and a</text>
  <text start="332.82" dur="3.599">citizenry against these major</text>
  <text start="334.59" dur="4.23">corporations that are attempting to</text>
  <text start="336.419" dur="4.47">systematically oppress others for simply</text>
  <text start="338.82" dur="3.839">possessing a wrong opinion and to</text>
  <text start="340.889" dur="3.571">essentially put free speech in general</text>
  <text start="342.659" dur="3.181">and the First Amendment as well as the</text>
  <text start="344.46" dur="3.449">rest of the Constitution into a</text>
  <text start="345.84" dur="3.72">stranglehold so I&amp;#39;m very interested to</text>
  <text start="347.909" dur="3.931">see what comes of this but as of now</text>
  <text start="349.56" dur="4.26">this is quite an interesting update that</text>
  <text start="351.84" dur="3.84">the Justice Department has launched this</text>
  <text start="353.82" dur="3.719">investigation and I&amp;#39;m very much looking</text>
  <text start="355.68" dur="3.81">forward to seeing what comes of that and</text>
  <text start="357.539" dur="4.081">as the story progresses we will also</text>
  <text start="359.49" dur="3.72">update regarding this issue but this</text>
  <text start="361.62" dur="3.63">will of course be very significant and</text>
  <text start="363.21" dur="3.9">this is precisely why we launched to</text>
  <text start="365.25" dur="4.229">stop it burning in the first place was</text>
  <text start="367.11" dur="3.96">to address the systemic censorship</text>
  <text start="369.479" dur="4.981">against conservatives in the right-wing</text>
  <text start="371.07" dur="5.67">to understand how significant it is to</text>
  <text start="374.46" dur="5.34">call out this problem before it reaches</text>
  <text start="376.74" dur="7.049">any further severe point before we get</text>
  <text start="379.8" dur="5.97">to the point in which we see a greater</text>
  <text start="383.789" dur="4.051">oppression of conservatives and others</text>
  <text start="385.77" dur="3.78">on the right wing it&amp;#39;s necessary for us</text>
  <text start="387.84" dur="3.24">to address this problem and this is why</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;re doing what we&amp;#39;re doing on stop</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="3.6">burning to address this so we would</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="3.5">appreciate it if you guys would help</text>
  <text start="394.68" dur="3.889">circulate our content on stop it burn</text>
  <text start="396.8" dur="4.019">to other social media sites so that we</text>
  <text start="398.569" dur="4.831">can spread the message that we simply</text>
  <text start="400.819" dur="4.44">refuse to be censored and no longer will</text>
  <text start="403.4" dur="3.769">we tolerate or allow our rights to be</text>
  <text start="405.259" dur="4.59">rescinded within the hands of</text>
  <text start="407.169" dur="4.601">totalitarian leftists of an overbearing</text>
  <text start="409.849" dur="5.31">government or within the hands of those</text>
  <text start="411.77" dur="5.73">who express interests and sympathies</text>
  <text start="415.159" dur="4.681">with communism no longer will we</text>
  <text start="417.5" dur="4.409">tolerate our rights being unjustifiably</text>
  <text start="419.84" dur="4.169">stolen away from us and for that reason</text>
  <text start="421.909" dur="4.531">we do precisely what we&amp;#39;re doing right</text>
  <text start="424.009" dur="3.75">now in the creation of this video and</text>
  <text start="426.44" dur="3.229">these topics so that we can make</text>
  <text start="427.759" dur="4.41">everyone else more educated about this</text>
  <text start="429.669" dur="5.951">so the question fundamentally comes down</text>
  <text start="432.169" dur="5.28">to one issue regarding this topic while</text>
  <text start="435.62" dur="3.18">it is wonderful that the President of</text>
  <text start="437.449" dur="3.09">the United States and then even the</text>
  <text start="438.8" dur="3.149">Justice Department in other areas of the</text>
  <text start="440.539" dur="4.021">federal government are interesting this</text>
  <text start="441.949" dur="4.351">is a problem we understand fundamentally</text>
  <text start="444.56" dur="4.8">that their primary goal should always be</text>
  <text start="446.3" dur="5.76">to serve us and in the event that that</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="4.609">right is not being protected in the</text>
  <text start="452.06" dur="5.25">event that we are not being protected</text>
  <text start="453.969" dur="4.75">constitutionally as we should be and the</text>
  <text start="457.31" dur="3.659">entity that is meant to be established</text>
  <text start="458.719" dur="5.67">as a method of protecting us rather</text>
  <text start="460.969" dur="6.38">adopts a role of totalitarianism we must</text>
  <text start="464.389" dur="5.731">ask ourselves as Americans one question</text>
  <text start="467.349" dur="5.32">in response to how we&amp;#39;re going to oppose</text>
  <text start="470.12" dur="7.26">this and confront this as a travesty of</text>
  <text start="472.669" dur="8.911">American justice if not us who if not</text>
  <text start="477.38" dur="6.48">now when and this is why we must stop</text>
  <text start="481.58" dur="5.66">the modern book-burning and that is</text>
  <text start="483.86" dur="3.38">stopped bit burning</text>
