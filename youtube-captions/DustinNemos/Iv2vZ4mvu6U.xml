  <text start="197.22" dur="4.68">if I says Declassified holy SH is</text>
  <text start="199.25" dur="5.05">absolutely but at the same point we have</text>
  <text start="201.9" dur="4.08">to set the game first so that we can</text>
  <text start="204.3" dur="3.15">maximize that and get the word out about</text>
  <text start="205.98" dur="3.33">it when it happens and everything else</text>
  <text start="207.45" dur="4.319">which means the alt media and the</text>
  <text start="209.31" dur="4.649">censorship issue that&amp;#39;s key before</text>
  <text start="211.769" dur="4.44">midterms Trump has already basically</text>
  <text start="213.959" dur="5.911">promised that he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="216.209" dur="7.071">addressing it that means that YouTube is</text>
  <text start="219.87" dur="3.41">gonna get off my back</text>
  <text start="225.739" dur="6.25">flat Creek I I generally do cover his</text>
  <text start="229.019" dur="5.22">tweets kind of on a certificate or</text>
  <text start="231.989" dur="4.111">lately I&amp;#39;ve not been covering each</text>
  <text start="234.239" dur="4.891">individual tweet and and I&amp;#39;ve been kind</text>
  <text start="236.1" dur="4.5">of glossing into the vagaries and going</text>
  <text start="239.13" dur="4.26">into the kind of the 40,000 foot</text>
  <text start="240.6" dur="5.46">overview and that&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;m you know</text>
  <text start="243.39" dur="5.34">I&amp;#39;m jumping around here moving in and</text>
  <text start="246.06" dur="5.88">laptop on the floor office things and</text>
  <text start="248.73" dur="4.8">things like that so my apologies I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="251.94" dur="4.62">usually much better at this stuff and</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="4.59">sourcing everything else some of my</text>
  <text start="256.56" dur="3.35">videos lately haven&amp;#39;t even had all the</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="3.75">links and the sources and that is</text>
  <text start="259.91" dur="4.33">generally not acceptable</text>
  <text start="261.87" dur="4.64">so I really appreciate people bearing</text>
  <text start="264.24" dur="2.27">with me</text>
  <text start="268.26" dur="4.08">midterms are I think it&amp;#39;s in September</text>

  <text start="272.34" dur="3.84">three months out now we&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="274.53" dur="3.3">within the three month range I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="276.18" dur="3.33">all of the things that are gonna lead up</text>
  <text start="277.83" dur="3.21">to that are gonna start here so we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="279.51" dur="3.42">already seen it III and I called it too</text>
  <text start="281.04" dur="4.11">right like I called it they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="4.35">start moving towards censorship and then</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;re gonna see them hold off for a</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="4.65">while and then it&amp;#39;s gonna seem quiet and</text>
  <text start="290.07" dur="3.51">then BOOM</text>
  <text start="291.93" dur="3">things are gonna hit right before</text>
  <text start="293.58" dur="3.27">midterms and then they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="294.93" dur="3.33">vie for the best opportunity to use</text>
  <text start="296.85" dur="3.69">whatever it is that they have stored up</text>
  <text start="298.26" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re gonna bring out the big guns so</text>
  <text start="300.54" dur="5.04">to speak which means they&amp;#39;re just gonna</text>
  <text start="303.15" dur="3.51">lie some more and the rest of us are</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="4.62">gonna actually have a victory after</text>
  <text start="306.66" dur="8.46">victory that&amp;#39;s kind of how it just seems</text>

  <text start="470.47" dur="7.169">c60 is then we will be in the know see</text>
  <text start="473.62" dur="7.08">60 is basically a carbon molecule with</text>
  <text start="477.639" dur="5.701">all of these I think 60 different oxygen</text>
  <text start="480.7" dur="4.73">atoms attached to it and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.34" dur="4.68">made headlines primarily because of the</text>
  <text start="485.43" dur="4.209">longevity research in rat studies and</text>
  <text start="488.02" dur="3.42">this is gonna be kind of interesting</text>
  <text start="489.639" dur="3.691">because I&amp;#39;m actually interested in doing</text>
  <text start="491.44" dur="3.15">a rat study myself behind me in the</text>
  <text start="493.33" dur="4.53">YouTube channel this is what I want to</text>
  <text start="494.59" dur="5.04">get to when the rat studies they</text>
  <text start="497.86" dur="5.52">actually extended the maximum lifespan</text>
  <text start="499.63" dur="7.17">of the rats by about 90% so that is</text>
  <text start="503.38" dur="5.49">really fascinating for a product that</text>
  <text start="506.8" dur="4.25">the head researcher called safe even in</text>
  <text start="508.87" dur="6.299">large doses over long periods of time</text>
  <text start="511.05" dur="6.28">you would consider it to be a substance</text>
  <text start="515.169" dur="4.05">similar to finally like tiny tiny tiny</text>
  <text start="517.33" dur="3.839">granules or something very similar to</text>
  <text start="519.219" dur="6.151">charcoal or something like that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="521.169" dur="7.29">just carbon but it has this effect where</text>
  <text start="525.37" dur="4.17">it just pulls in and binds toxins but it</text>
  <text start="528.459" dur="3.681">doesn&amp;#39;t get used up</text>
  <text start="529.54" dur="7.02">like most antioxidants it just keeps</text>
  <text start="532.14" dur="5.08">doing it for days it is incredibly</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="3.6">powerful</text>
  <text start="537.22" dur="4.47">not just for longevity effects you know</text>
  <text start="540.16" dur="3.33">not making any claims or medical advice</text>
  <text start="541.69" dur="3.27">or anything like that but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.49" dur="2.52">incredibly powerful for some of the</text>
  <text start="544.96" dur="4.83">health effects some of the cancer</text>
  <text start="546.01" dur="4.95">effects there&amp;#39;s just so many different</text>
  <text start="549.79" dur="3.63">things that are coming out about this</text>
  <text start="550.96" dur="5.43">relatively new and unknown product it</text>

  <text start="2954.02" dur="3.81">know they haven&amp;#39;t changed the way that</text>
  <text start="2955.76" dur="2.43">they report on these numbers in an odd</text>
  <text start="2957.83" dur="2.4">way</text>
  <text start="2958.19" dur="3.96">so like inflation numbers which are</text>
  <text start="2960.23" dur="4.38">actually helpful are way higher than</text>
  <text start="2962.15" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re realistically supposed to be</text>
  <text start="2964.61" dur="4.17">like how they&amp;#39;re officially reported and</text>

  <text start="2988.799" dur="5.641">sell them on the website to fund this</text>
  <text start="2991.049" dur="5.73">show that are like custom-made widgets</text>

  <text start="2996.779" dur="3.171">download basically like there&amp;#39;s a ton of</text>
  <text start="2998.609" dur="4.71">things you could print they&amp;#39;re useful</text>
  <text start="2999.95" dur="4.51">with a 3d printer I was thinking about I</text>
  <text start="3003.319" dur="2.28">was talking about it with the wife and</text>

  <text start="3060.38" dur="6.599">part of and just my opinion we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="3065.329" dur="4.95">situation very similar to right before</text>
  <text start="3066.979" dur="6.39">o8 when it crashed and we&amp;#39;re in a a bond</text>

  <text start="3180.07" dur="4.83">my opinion Venezuela proved that there</text>
  <text start="3183.46" dur="3.36">is still a lot more faith in gold</text>
  <text start="3184.9" dur="4.02">because when they read about when they</text>
  <text start="3186.82" dur="2.79">revalued versus gold they actually go to</text>
  <text start="3188.92" dur="2.55">better than silver</text>
  <text start="3189.61" dur="3.84">but generally speaking silver has been</text>
  <text start="3191.47" dur="3.66">better fundamentals than gold so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3193.45" dur="4.73">really just a belief system thing there</text>
