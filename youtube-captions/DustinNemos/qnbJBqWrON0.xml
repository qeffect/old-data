  <text start="33.239" dur="3.631">I&amp;#39;ll show you guys this and more right</text>
  <text start="34.98" dur="4.41">after a short word from our sponsors</text>
  <text start="36.87" dur="5.13">there was a time when I had my head in</text>
  <text start="39.39" dur="5.31">the sand then I found out that powered</text>
  <text start="42" dur="5.46">players pass lies for truth and truth</text>
  <text start="44.7" dur="5.49">for the lies especially in areas of life</text>

  <text start="77.22" dur="5.83">all right so first of all in the UK and</text>
  <text start="81.43" dur="3.39">this affects the whole world because</text>
  <text start="83.05" dur="3.57">this is a pretty major move it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="84.82" dur="5.58">almost as though Trump just won in the</text>
  <text start="86.62" dur="7.34">UK basically brexit should in theory now</text>
  <text start="90.4" dur="6.6">happen for sure Boris Johnson gets a</text>
  <text start="93.96" dur="6.73">massive landslide victory and he</text>
  <text start="97" dur="6.03">basically ran on get brexit done as his</text>
  <text start="100.69" dur="4.32">campaign slogan so he&amp;#39;s ready to pull</text>
  <text start="103.03" dur="3.96">out of the EU which is of course a a</text>
  <text start="105.01" dur="4.73">fast sinking ship that&amp;#39;s falling apart</text>
  <text start="106.99" dur="5.4">and the cracks are starting to show and</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="4.54">you know multiculturalism and and a</text>
  <text start="112.39" dur="4.86">block of different countries with us a</text>
  <text start="114.28" dur="6.39">superpower parasitical class in Brussels</text>
  <text start="117.25" dur="5.13">is not the way to go clearly now hide</text>
  <text start="120.67" dur="3.27">your children because this next one is a</text>
  <text start="122.38" dur="2.25">little bit graphic and if you have a</text>
  <text start="123.94" dur="2.1">soft heart</text>
  <text start="124.63" dur="3.36">I&amp;#39;ll go ahead and tell you what it is</text>
  <text start="126.04" dur="5.1">before I show you just in case it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="127.99" dur="5.61">child being beaten by other kids at a</text>
  <text start="131.14" dur="7.59">school pretty graphic let me show you</text>
  <text start="133.6" dur="9.38">what I&amp;#39;m talking about here this poor</text>
  <text start="138.73" dur="7.259">kid is getting beaten 8 on one this</text>
  <text start="142.98" dur="5.62">young kid in a I think it&amp;#39;s a middle</text>
  <text start="145.989" dur="4.381">school pretty sure he gets beaten in the</text>
  <text start="148.6" dur="4.26">back of a school bus eight on one you</text>
  <text start="150.37" dur="4.23">see him try to fight back and he just he</text>
  <text start="152.86" dur="5.28">just keeps getting being this poor kid</text>
  <text start="154.6" dur="5.46">ends up in a hospital because he wore a</text>
  <text start="158.14" dur="4.92">trump hat to school he also had milk</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="7.77">dumped on his head that day and look</text>
  <text start="163.06" dur="6.42">this is this is this is a hate crime is</text>
  <text start="167.83" dur="3.99">a hate crime against conservatives I</text>
  <text start="169.48" dur="4.02">mean certainly eight black kids beat up</text>
  <text start="171.82" dur="4.41">one white kid could be considered a hate</text>
  <text start="173.5" dur="4.26">crime under reverse situations if this</text>
  <text start="176.23" dur="3.33">were eight white kids beat up a black</text>
  <text start="177.76" dur="5.009">kid I think the whole country would be</text>
  <text start="179.56" dur="5.58">screaming hate crime hate crime KKK Nazi</text>
  <text start="182.769" dur="4.351">but if they wear a trump hat and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="185.14" dur="4.26">black kids beating up a poor white kid</text>
  <text start="187.12" dur="5.49">and the back of the bus who tries to put</text>
  <text start="189.4" dur="5.339">up a fight and you know you see that the</text>
  <text start="192.61" dur="5.909">hammer the hammer hits just again and</text>
  <text start="194.739" dur="6.331">again land on his poor body and then of</text>
  <text start="198.519" dur="4.351">course that&amp;#39;s exactly what you would</text>
  <text start="201.07" dur="4.77">expect from the sort of hate mongering</text>
  <text start="202.87" dur="4.949">that the left constantly does I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="205.84" dur="3.82">thought long and hard about showing that</text>
  <text start="207.819" dur="3.641">to you guys because I didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="209.66" dur="3.48">but I also wanted to make sure that you</text>
  <text start="211.46" dur="5.88">guys have seen and everyone out there</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="6.63">does see the kind of the kind of people</text>
  <text start="217.34" dur="4.35">that are truly on the sides of you know</text>
  <text start="219.77" dur="4.29">Republican or Democrat in this kind of</text>
  <text start="221.69" dur="4.23">2020 lineup because it really does seem</text>
  <text start="224.06" dur="5.01">that the party of the Democrats has</text>
  <text start="225.92" dur="6.72">devolved into hatred and overt hostility</text>
  <text start="229.07" dur="4.95">of any sort of any opinion that strays</text>
  <text start="232.64" dur="6.29">from the narrative that they&amp;#39;re used to</text>
  <text start="234.02" dur="7.26">or any any free think or wrong think and</text>
  <text start="238.93" dur="3.67">anyone that&amp;#39;s Pro Trump or anything that</text>
  <text start="241.28" dur="3.75">doesn&amp;#39;t agree with exactly what they</text>
  <text start="242.6" dur="3.99">believe is considered the enemy and that</text>
  <text start="245.03" dur="3.36">sort of tribalism and that groupthink</text>
  <text start="246.59" dur="3.87">makes them very hostile to others</text>
  <text start="248.39" dur="3.45">especially when you know you have the</text>
  <text start="250.46" dur="4.32">fake news with their hashtag on</text>
  <text start="251.84" dur="5.85">Republicans and then glorifying antiva</text>
  <text start="254.78" dur="4.62">and nonsense like that downplaying all</text>
  <text start="257.69" dur="3.45">the acts of violence making it seem as</text>
  <text start="259.4" dur="2.97">though in fact that Trump supporters</text>
  <text start="261.14" dur="3.54">were the violent ones even though we</text>
  <text start="262.37" dur="6.45">know Hillary actually hired people to go</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="6.54">to both Bernie and Trump campaigns and</text>
  <text start="268.82" dur="4.59">probably others to cause violence and</text>
  <text start="271.22" dur="4.89">try to stir the pot and try to create</text>
  <text start="273.41" dur="4.95">you know violent scenes and clashing</text>
  <text start="276.11" dur="4.05">scenes for the media to use against them</text>
  <text start="278.36" dur="3.15">in the narrative I mean it&amp;#39;s not even</text>
  <text start="280.16" dur="3.48">frankly it&amp;#39;s not even that expensive</text>
  <text start="281.51" dur="3.99">right anyone could pull off something</text>
  <text start="283.64" dur="2.49">like that if they had the balls to go do</text>
  <text start="285.5" dur="3.86">it</text>
  <text start="286.13" dur="5.43">Hillary seems to to certainly have that</text>
  <text start="289.36" dur="6.13">she&amp;#39;s right up there with Michael Obama</text>
  <text start="291.56" dur="6.57">in that regard I&amp;#39;m bad at humor I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="4.29">know what do you think anyway so here we</text>
  <text start="298.13" dur="3.96">have another piece of humor Bernie</text>
  <text start="299.78" dur="4.2">Sanders saying what would canceling all</text>
  <text start="302.09" dur="5.13">student debt mean for you and your</text>
  <text start="303.98" dur="5.13">family and you know I&amp;#39;m gonna take this</text>
  <text start="307.22" dur="4.95">at face value and not assume that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="5.4">pandering to a parasitical class of</text>
  <text start="312.17" dur="4.5">commie kids that were talking socialism</text>
  <text start="314.51" dur="4.41">communism is the answer while also</text>
  <text start="316.67" dur="4.2">racking up unpayable and unsustainable</text>
  <text start="318.92" dur="3.9">student debt for a system that screwed</text>
  <text start="320.87" dur="3.99">them and didn&amp;#39;t teach them much so</text>
  <text start="322.82" dur="6.57">there&amp;#39;s a whole lot of angry and</text>
  <text start="324.86" dur="6.99">resentful indentured servant leftists</text>
  <text start="329.39" dur="5.55">for the most part communists kids out</text>
  <text start="331.85" dur="4.5">there who think that they deserve a free</text>
  <text start="334.94" dur="3.81">ticket and we should pay for their</text>
  <text start="336.35" dur="4.319">mistakes now I will answer that question</text>
  <text start="338.75" dur="3.499">assuming that that&amp;#39;s not the case and</text>
  <text start="340.669" dur="4.58">assuming he&amp;#39;s not pandering and he acts</text>
  <text start="342.249" dur="4.32">minted intentionally and earnestly what</text>
  <text start="345.249" dur="3.21">that would mean if you were to take a</text>
  <text start="346.569" dur="4.2">large chunk of the population and</text>
  <text start="348.459" dur="4.47">forgive a a massive piece of debt for</text>
  <text start="350.769" dur="4.17">them what that would mean is that me is</text>
  <text start="352.929" dur="3.54">the taxpayer and others as the taxpayers</text>
  <text start="354.939" dur="3.15">would then have to foot the additional</text>
  <text start="356.469" dur="4.17">cost and burden of whatever</text>
  <text start="358.089" dur="5.55">redistribution that you just did right</text>
  <text start="360.639" dur="4.44">so if you were to pay off in the</text>
  <text start="363.639" dur="3.72">colleges or something for all this</text>
  <text start="365.079" dur="4.83">massive student debt not only would it</text>
  <text start="367.359" dur="5.07">create a bad isn&amp;#39;t if structure for kids</text>
  <text start="369.909" dur="4.77">and and future expectations of handouts</text>
  <text start="372.429" dur="4.38">and and bailouts and such</text>
  <text start="374.679" dur="3.931">it would also Jack the prices of college</text>
  <text start="376.809" dur="3.54">education for other kids like my</text>
  <text start="378.61" dur="3.119">children in the future if I even want to</text>
  <text start="380.349" dur="3.84">send them to a college because of the</text>
  <text start="381.729" dur="4.89">propaganda and indoctrination hopefully</text>
  <text start="384.189" dur="4.08">won&amp;#39;t be as bad you know fifteen or</text>
  <text start="386.619" dur="3.991">twenty years down the road from Trump</text>
  <text start="388.269" dur="4.56">era after we&amp;#39;ve already made the country</text>
  <text start="390.61" dur="3.779">great again but you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="392.829" dur="3.33">basically just shifting the burden for</text>
  <text start="394.389" dur="3.36">the mistake on to other people and</text>
  <text start="396.159" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;re sort of masking it in the tax</text>
  <text start="397.749" dur="3.27">system but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the</text>
  <text start="399.399" dur="3.81">burden doesn&amp;#39;t carry on you&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="401.019" dur="3.96">hurting other people with that in fact I</text>
  <text start="403.209" dur="4.17">liked this one post here that it was</text>
  <text start="404.979" dur="4.35">very simply it was succinct he says it</text>
  <text start="407.379" dur="4.11">would mean taking on those students debt</text>
  <text start="409.329" dur="4.35">and literally that&amp;#39;s exactly what it</text>
  <text start="411.489" dur="7.35">would equate to that is what it would</text>
  <text start="413.679" dur="6.75">mean so we also have I guess a report of</text>
  <text start="418.839" dur="3.36">the poor kid and he can kind of see him</text>
  <text start="420.429" dur="4.17">afterwards in hospital he was pretty</text>
  <text start="422.199" dur="5.19">beat up his dad took a picture of him</text>
  <text start="424.599" dur="4.71">but hit his face and now they are of</text>
  <text start="427.389" dur="4.77">course hiring an attorney and and</text>
  <text start="429.309" dur="4.551">hopefully that will will pay out big and</text>
  <text start="432.159" dur="4.59">this poor kid deserves every bit of it</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="4.119">and look if anyone knows this child or</text>
  <text start="436.749" dur="3.57">his family I would like to interview</text>
  <text start="437.979" dur="4.26">this kid I think he&amp;#39;s a champ for for</text>
  <text start="440.319" dur="4.26">taking the courage to wear that Magga</text>
  <text start="442.239" dur="5.76">hat to school in the first place and</text>
  <text start="444.579" dur="6.98">here&amp;#39;s a quote I am sitting in my in the</text>
  <text start="447.999" dur="6.39">hospital with my 14 year old kid my gosh</text>
  <text start="451.559" dur="4.63">and continuing on because he was jumped</text>
  <text start="454.389" dur="3.45">by II blind kids on the school bus I</text>
  <text start="456.189" dur="4.02">guess that&amp;#39;s what happens when a kid</text>
  <text start="457.839" dur="4.86">wears a trump hat to school and who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.209" dur="5.61">the violent ones again earlier today</text>
  <text start="462.699" dur="4.71">they poured milk all over his head the</text>
  <text start="465.819" dur="4.7">parent who uses the Twitter handle</text>
  <text start="467.409" dur="4.4">American Diaries tweeted this out today</text>
  <text start="470.519" dur="5.621">Wow</text>
  <text start="471.809" dur="7.301">so we also have this guy actor Patton</text>
  <text start="476.14" dur="6.41">Oswalt who thinks that if you voted for</text>
  <text start="479.11" dur="6.18">Trump hole you&amp;#39;re a stupid asshole and</text>
  <text start="482.55" dur="4.36">of course that doesn&amp;#39;t win any friends</text>
  <text start="485.29" dur="4.5">and basically is the reason that</text>
  <text start="486.91" dur="4.89">Hollywood is falling apart and you know</text>
  <text start="489.79" dur="5.16">their ratings are as down as CNN&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.8" dur="5.01">basically and I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="494.95" dur="3.21">particularly care about actors or their</text>
  <text start="496.81" dur="2.7">opinions but I just wanted you to know</text>
  <text start="498.16" dur="2.91">that when you&amp;#39;re watching television</text>
  <text start="499.51" dur="3.15">you&amp;#39;re watching entertainment and</text>
  <text start="501.07" dur="3.95">watching the movies during the holidays</text>
  <text start="502.66" dur="4.29">if you see this guy turn the channel</text>
  <text start="505.02" dur="4.03">there&amp;#39;s quite a few of them out there</text>
  <text start="506.95" dur="4.17">who have already been exposed exposed</text>
  <text start="509.05" dur="4.38">for sexual crimes like Weinstein</text>
  <text start="511.12" dur="4.62">Hollywood is replete with those but for</text>
  <text start="513.43" dur="4.11">the most part let&amp;#39;s be honest here</text>
  <text start="515.74" dur="3.92">Weinstein took advantage of women that</text>
  <text start="517.54" dur="4.62">wanted the job right and they</text>
  <text start="519.66" dur="3.91">consensually had sex with him no I I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="522.16" dur="3.9">suspect he may have been involved with</text>
  <text start="523.57" dur="4.44">children as well but that&amp;#39;s not what was</text>
  <text start="526.06" dur="5.04">exposed with Weinstein for the most part</text>
  <text start="528.01" dur="6.12">that was just sort of a casting couch</text>
  <text start="531.1" dur="4.71">where prostitutes for a better word for</text>
  <text start="534.13" dur="4.47">lack of a better word in this case</text>
  <text start="535.81" dur="7.17">become actresses by impressing the right</text>
  <text start="538.6" dur="6.27">people with the right moves but there</text>
  <text start="542.98" dur="4.23">are also an undercurrent in Hollywood</text>
  <text start="544.87" dur="5.01">and the entertainment industry and big</text>
  <text start="547.21" dur="5.28">media and and also of course the swamp</text>
  <text start="549.88" dur="6.45">DC and just in the halls of power</text>
  <text start="552.49" dur="6.33">worldwide that that trades and children</text>
  <text start="556.33" dur="6.18">and traffic&amp;#39;s and the flesh of children</text>
  <text start="558.82" dur="5.31">and our pedophilia and you know maybe</text>
  <text start="562.51" dur="3.3">some of that is blackmail like what we</text>
  <text start="564.13" dur="3.96">saw with F Steen where Hugh certainly</text>
  <text start="565.81" dur="5.25">was engaging with you know underage</text>
  <text start="568.09" dur="5.88">children and had a 3-story maybe more</text>
  <text start="571.06" dur="6.12">temple dungeon underneath his uh island</text>
  <text start="573.97" dur="6.42">temple which is all sorts of scary and</text>
  <text start="577.18" dur="5.61">creepy anyway but my point is that the</text>
  <text start="580.39" dur="4.17">reason that this culture is lashing out</text>
  <text start="582.79" dur="4.44">at President Trump is because many of</text>
  <text start="584.56" dur="4.41">the leaders are exposed for their</text>
