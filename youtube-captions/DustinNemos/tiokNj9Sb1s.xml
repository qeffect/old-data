  <text start="13.43" dur="5.71">welcome back my friends we are going to</text>
  <text start="16.379" dur="5.551">discuss two important things</text>
  <text start="19.14" dur="6.75">Trump related now the first of these</text>
  <text start="21.93" dur="7.43">things is it seems that Trump is going</text>
  <text start="25.89" dur="8.099">right along with the gun grabber base</text>
  <text start="29.36" dur="7.03">the left the Democrats the the the deep</text>
  <text start="33.989" dur="6.84">state people that want to get rid of gun</text>
  <text start="36.39" dur="9.81">rights let me let me qualify that and</text>
  <text start="40.829" dur="7.111">explain so we all know Steve Scalise the</text>
  <text start="46.2" dur="5.879">the Republican lawmaker that was shot</text>
  <text start="47.94" dur="7.08">and survived he suggested the</text>
  <text start="52.079" dur="11.761">reciprocity law which would require all</text>
  <text start="55.02" dur="10.499">states to to allow concealed carry Trump</text>
  <text start="63.84" dur="3.15">kind of rejected that I mean was polite</text>
  <text start="65.519" dur="3.691">about it but he sort of rejected that he</text>
  <text start="66.99" dur="4.2">said that&amp;#39;s not gonna pass and this bill</text>
  <text start="69.21" dur="4.53">we should do that separately another</text>
  <text start="71.19" dur="6.59">time I don&amp;#39;t want that one but he did</text>
  <text start="73.74" dur="6.66">allow this Democrats gun control bill</text>
  <text start="77.78" dur="5.5">and he said that would be like a base we</text>
  <text start="80.4" dur="5.52">can build on that and it it&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="83.28" dur="3.81">code for I mean it talks about</text>
  <text start="85.92" dur="3.53">strengthening the reporting of</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="4.319">information the background check system</text>
  <text start="89.45" dur="4.06">requires background checks on all</text>
  <text start="91.409" dur="6">commercial sells but that&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="93.51" dur="9.39">code for private gun sale background</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="7.171">checks all right this is one of those</text>
  <text start="102.9" dur="4.259">big things that people have been</text>
  <text start="104.58" dur="5.13">resisting in the past you know they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="107.159" dur="7.081">already tried this bill basically after</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="12.18">Sandy Hook and it was rejected April</text>
  <text start="114.24" dur="11.19">17th to 2013 so this is a move backwards</text>
  <text start="121.89" dur="5.839">for us if Trump is supporting this then</text>
  <text start="125.43" dur="4.91">it&amp;#39;s probably gonna get passed folks and</text>
  <text start="127.729" dur="5.441">we know that left will be all for it and</text>
  <text start="130.34" dur="5.229">a lot of the right will do it just</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="4.28">because it&amp;#39;s Trump and I think this is a</text>
  <text start="135.569" dur="4.131">mistake we should not</text>
  <text start="137.45" dur="3.81">support things just because it comes</text>
  <text start="139.7" dur="3.06">from Trump we should support the things</text>
  <text start="141.26" dur="5.04">that we agree with because Trump agrees</text>
  <text start="142.76" dur="7.05">with them remember that he is he is not</text>
  <text start="146.3" dur="7.26">Jesus folks now this is this is scary</text>
  <text start="149.81" dur="5.1">because Trump is kind of kind of bowing</text>
  <text start="153.56" dur="3.42">his head a little bit to the gun</text>
  <text start="154.91" dur="6.27">grabbers you know he&amp;#39;s already talked</text>
  <text start="156.98" dur="5.82">about bump stocks and I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="161.18" dur="3.69">care about bump stocks but they have no</text>
  <text start="162.8" dur="3.42">right to take them from us all right</text>
  <text start="164.87" dur="2.94">they don&amp;#39;t have a right to take a tank</text>
  <text start="166.22" dur="4.83">from us I mean we have to have the same</text>
  <text start="167.81" dur="5.67">mill the same level of weaponry and</text>
  <text start="171.05" dur="5.1">power and firepower as the military has</text>
  <text start="173.48" dur="4.61">in order to resist the government that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="176.15" dur="5.16">the whole point of the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="178.09" dur="4.93">not for hunting and not even really just</text>
  <text start="181.31" dur="6.93">for protection and self-defense</text>
  <text start="183.02" dur="9.11">it was designed to counter corruption</text>
  <text start="188.24" dur="6.21">and abuse of power and in government</text>
  <text start="192.13" dur="3.67">anyway that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s very concerning I</text>
  <text start="194.45" dur="2.67">wanted to mention it</text>
  <text start="195.8" dur="3.65">we should definitely pay attention to</text>
  <text start="197.12" dur="4.71">how that develops now another thing</text>
  <text start="199.45" dur="4.39">Facebook is basically shadow banning</text>
  <text start="201.83" dur="3.45">Trump this is this is I was gonna do a</text>
  <text start="203.84" dur="5.01">video just for this and then I added the</text>
  <text start="205.28" dur="9.24">gun thing in you can see by this chart</text>
  <text start="208.85" dur="9.54">right here that his engagement on</text>
  <text start="214.52" dur="5.91">Facebook is actually down 45% no you</text>
  <text start="218.39" dur="3.93">know we all know him for Twitter but</text>
  <text start="220.43" dur="4.62">basically because of social media in his</text>
  <text start="222.32" dur="6.18">mastery of it he&amp;#39;s been able to reach</text>
  <text start="225.05" dur="5.7">the people that is going to be more and</text>
  <text start="228.5" dur="4.14">more difficult when they start changing</text>
  <text start="230.75" dur="4.2">the algorithms and toying with things</text>
  <text start="232.64" dur="6.03">and messing with the code on the back</text>
  <text start="234.95" dur="5.509">end so that we unbeknownst to us are</text>
  <text start="238.67" dur="6.66">having a harder time getting to Trump</text>
  <text start="240.459" dur="6.161">okay this is just Facebook but I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="245.33" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re all gonna be working on it okay</text>
  <text start="246.62" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;ve already seen YouTube censoring in</text>
  <text start="249.17" dur="4.71">mass and then up up basically trying to</text>
  <text start="252.44" dur="4.62">blame it on their new employees now</text>
  <text start="253.88" dur="8.42">because they&amp;#39;re backtracking but this is</text>
  <text start="257.06" dur="7.62">not good so this is the response</text>
  <text start="262.3" dur="4.9">remember the other day that Q had told</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="3.989">us that at Jack was kind of scared</text>
  <text start="267.2" dur="3.06">that&amp;#39;s Jack Dorsey of Twitter he was</text>
  <text start="268.669" dur="1.981">having trouble sleeping he was nervous</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="3.03">he</text>
  <text start="270.65" dur="5.13">he was protected well guess what now</text>
  <text start="273.29" dur="4.56">since that happened we&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="275.78" dur="4.29">launch of massive censorship on YouTube</text>
  <text start="277.85" dur="7.31">bans of the conservative youtubers we</text>
  <text start="280.07" dur="8.61">have seen many people on Twitter being</text>
  <text start="285.16" dur="5.68">suspended or or outright closed many of</text>
  <text start="288.68" dur="4.109">the messages in my own Twitter inbox</text>
  <text start="290.84" dur="3.09">have little locks on them now I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="292.789" dur="4.321">even reply to those people anymore</text>
  <text start="293.93" dur="5.489">because they&amp;#39;re banned people lost many</text>
  <text start="297.11" dur="5.399">of their followers on Twitter you know</text>
  <text start="299.419" dur="5.22">and YouTube influencers so stuffs going</text>
  <text start="302.509" dur="4.44">on on all three platforms and it all</text>
  <text start="304.639" dur="4.441">happened since that Q post I think</text>
  <text start="306.949" dur="5.511">they&amp;#39;re related because we know at least</text>
  <text start="309.08" dur="6.78">Jack was scared and we&amp;#39;ve also seen</text>
  <text start="312.46" dur="6.85">Zuckerberg selling millions and millions</text>
  <text start="315.86" dur="7.02">of dollars worth of Facebook shares so</text>
  <text start="319.31" dur="5.729">we have panic across all three platforms</text>
