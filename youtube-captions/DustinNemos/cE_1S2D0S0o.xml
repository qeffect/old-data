  <text start="45.78" dur="5.49">going to get caught up on all of these</text>
  <text start="47.309" dur="7.14">cue posts I am filling in for Dustin</text>
  <text start="51.27" dur="5.88">because he has been rather busy in the</text>
  <text start="54.449" dur="5.61">background with the Free Speech Movement</text>
  <text start="57.15" dur="4.29">and stop it burning calm and making</text>
  <text start="60.059" dur="5.011">alliances with some pretty powerful</text>
  <text start="61.44" dur="5.52">people so do give him a little pass for</text>
  <text start="65.07" dur="4.829">that cuz he has been working rather hard</text>
  <text start="66.96" dur="5.519">so I am filling in for him so let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="69.899" dur="4.381">started alright the first one we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="72.479" dur="5.64">gonna go over is from the 29th of July</text>
  <text start="74.28" dur="5.759">35 33 and it says reminder regarding</text>
  <text start="78.119" dur="4.92">impeachment two-thirds of the Senate</text>
  <text start="80.039" dur="5.161">vote required to impeach POTUS 53 to 47</text>
  <text start="83.039" dur="4.921">logical thinking you&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="4.83">Democrats con liberal base using hope</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="3.45">tactics while maintaining POTUS</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="4.8">obstruction of justice fake news</text>
  <text start="91.41" dur="6.659">narrative think 2020 so the mullah</text>
  <text start="94.83" dur="6.33">testimony was really about optics the</text>
  <text start="98.069" dur="4.591">Democrats didn&amp;#39;t really think that they</text>
  <text start="101.16" dur="4.17">were going to find out any new</text>
  <text start="102.66" dur="6.09">information by questioning Moeller in</text>
  <text start="105.33" dur="7.289">front of the public all that was was a</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="6">way to get people to continue to think</text>
  <text start="112.619" dur="6.691">that President Trump has done something</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="7.77">wrong so then they can justify calls for</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="4.77">impeachment even though they also know</text>
  <text start="122.52" dur="3.45">that they can&amp;#39;t really impeach him</text>
  <text start="124.08" dur="4.83">number one because they don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="125.97" dur="5.72">real grounds to impeach him also number</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="5.12">two has to go through the Senate and</text>
  <text start="131.69" dur="6.82">they know the Senate will never approve</text>
  <text start="134.03" dur="10.209">impeachment so really all it is is a way</text>
  <text start="138.51" dur="8.309">to keep their base satisfied by thinking</text>
  <text start="144.239" dur="5.191">that they are going to somehow unseat</text>
  <text start="146.819" dur="3.241">president Trump which will not happen</text>
  <text start="149.43" dur="3.24">this way</text>
  <text start="150.06" dur="6.3">they know it&amp;#39;s not but that&amp;#39;s all that</text>
  <text start="152.67" dur="6.599">this was also on the flip side I do want</text>
  <text start="156.36" dur="5.489">to say that the questioning that came</text>
  <text start="159.269" dur="3.121">from the Republican side was also about</text>
  <text start="161.849" dur="2.191">Optive</text>
  <text start="162.39" dur="4.35">because the questions that they were</text>
  <text start="164.04" dur="5.85">asking regarding the origins of this</text>
  <text start="166.74" dur="5.31">investigation it was about optics</text>
  <text start="169.89" dur="3.96">because they knew they weren&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="172.05" dur="4.08">have those questions answered because it</text>
  <text start="173.85" dur="6.87">was a part of ongoing investigation so</text>
  <text start="176.13" dur="6.77">really it was a way to number one remind</text>
  <text start="180.72" dur="4.98">those of us who already know about this</text>
  <text start="182.9" dur="5.55">remind us that yes there is an</text>
  <text start="185.7" dur="5.25">investigation that is going on there is</text>
  <text start="188.45" dur="7.6">something happening in the background</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="7.89">that we can&amp;#39;t see also it was to reach</text>
  <text start="196.05" dur="5.43">out to those who maybe are on the fence</text>
  <text start="198.84" dur="5.94">and get them to question themselves</text>
  <text start="201.48" dur="5.82">about these facts so really it was all</text>
  <text start="204.78" dur="6.15">about optics that&amp;#39;s all the Muller</text>
  <text start="207.3" dur="6.18">testimony was and of course like</text>
  <text start="210.93" dur="4.44">clockwork they immediately right after</text>
  <text start="213.48" dur="3.69">the testimony the Democrats did come out</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="3.39">at a press conference saying that they</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="3.42">were going to think about maybe</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="6.18">investigating whether or not they should</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="7.92">impeach which basically means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="224.94" dur="5.7">not gonna do anything all right so the</text>
  <text start="228.51" dur="5.46">next one thirty five thirty four there</text>
  <text start="230.64" dur="5.67">is a link to a report on human</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="4.2">trafficking says Maryland has second</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="4.38">most defendants charged in federal human</text>
  <text start="238.17" dur="5.61">trafficking cases who represents</text>
  <text start="240.69" dur="6.48">Maryland in the House Senate the more</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="5.22">you know so I will say this I did look</text>
  <text start="247.17" dur="5.67">at the report in Maryland is actually</text>
  <text start="249" dur="6.81">not the the second most in convictions</text>
  <text start="252.84" dur="5.28">worried those charts it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="4.47">California that is the second most and</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="4.7">Florida my home state is actually number</text>
  <text start="260.28" dur="6.81">three which does not surprise me at all</text>
  <text start="262.82" dur="7.03">especially after this whole craft case</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="4.44">that really went nowhere I&amp;#39;m hoping that</text>
  <text start="269.85" dur="5.49">at some point they might reopen that</text>
  <text start="271.53" dur="6.3">investigation because really it started</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="6.12">out as an international human</text>
  <text start="277.83" dur="6.63">trafficking case but then they watered</text>
  <text start="281.46" dur="7.709">it down to a prostitution sting which</text>
  <text start="284.46" dur="8.85">was wrong but anyway so but Maryland is</text>
  <text start="289.169" dur="6.361">one of the higher states as far as being</text>
  <text start="293.31" dur="2.91">ranked in human trafficking but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="295.53" dur="3.57">the second</text>
  <text start="296.22" dur="5.49">horn is second so who represents</text>
  <text start="299.1" dur="5.82">Maryland well that would be Cummings</text>
  <text start="301.71" dur="5.85">okay who&amp;#39;s come out as rather vocal</text>
  <text start="304.92" dur="5">after president Trump has you know</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="6.6">basically come out and criticized</text>
  <text start="309.92" dur="8.41">Baltimore which you know is completely</text>
  <text start="314.16" dur="7.86">justified and you know it&amp;#39;s not anything</text>
  <text start="318.33" dur="6.6">new that Baltimore is not necessarily</text>
  <text start="322.02" dur="4.53">the nicest place in the country but</text>
  <text start="324.93" dur="4.05">let&amp;#39;s check out this Twitter status from</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="3.9">Charlie Kirk so Charlie Kirk says did</text>
  <text start="328.98" dur="3.27">you know the last three mayors of</text>
  <text start="330.45" dur="3.75">Baltimore have all stepped down or been</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="8.4">forced out of office for corruption all</text>
  <text start="334.2" dur="9.69">three were Democrats see a pattern so at</text>
  <text start="340.65" dur="8.91">this point it&amp;#39;s becoming rather apparent</text>
  <text start="343.89" dur="7.2">that several Democrats are corrupt now</text>
  <text start="349.56" dur="3.84">that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that Republicans</text>
  <text start="351.09" dur="6.51">aren&amp;#39;t corrupt either but there seems to</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="8.82">be more of a pattern with Democrats so</text>
  <text start="357.6" dur="9.18">he&amp;#39;s calling them out all right the next</text>
  <text start="362.22" dur="8.55">one there is a Twitter status that is</text>
  <text start="366.78" dur="5.639">being posted and it is a picture of it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="370.77" dur="3.899">a screen capture actually a president</text>
  <text start="372.419" dur="4.171">Trump and it&amp;#39;s from Fox News it says</text>
  <text start="374.669" dur="5.341">President Trump on national security we</text>
  <text start="376.59" dur="4.95">are calling for great awakening of us so</text>
  <text start="380.01" dur="7.26">of course we know that great awakening</text>
  <text start="381.54" dur="6.93">is what we call the current era that</text>
  <text start="387.27" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re in right now</text>
  <text start="388.47" dur="6.54">that was really facilitated by the Q</text>
  <text start="391.74" dur="5.489">post because really whether or not you</text>
  <text start="395.01" dur="4.17">believe in q and on and who they are</text>
  <text start="397.229" dur="4.141">whether you believe their military or</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="4.2">some guy in his basement it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="401.37" dur="5.76">information that&amp;#39;s being put out and</text>
  <text start="403.38" dur="6.75">it&amp;#39;s really following the Socratic</text>
  <text start="407.13" dur="5.07">method where it presents a question and</text>
  <text start="410.13" dur="4.47">then we have to ask ourselves the</text>
  <text start="412.2" dur="5.93">question and then we answer it by doing</text>
  <text start="414.6" dur="8.689">our own research it&amp;#39;s really about</text>
  <text start="418.13" dur="8.95">waking up to what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="423.289" dur="6.481">that&amp;#39;s what the Great Awakening is so it</text>
  <text start="427.08" dur="6.049">used to be several years ago</text>
  <text start="429.77" dur="5.34">that people who actually knew what was</text>
  <text start="433.129" dur="3.811">going on in the government it was a very</text>
  <text start="435.11" dur="4.89">select few and they were called</text>
  <text start="436.94" dur="7.199">conspiracy theorists now that number is</text>
  <text start="440" dur="5.669">increasing significantly and that is why</text>
  <text start="444.139" dur="6.391">it&amp;#39;s called the Great Awakening because</text>
  <text start="445.669" dur="10.111">people are waking up the gig is up we no</text>
  <text start="450.53" dur="10.56">longer believe that these people who are</text>
  <text start="455.78" dur="10.59">corrupt are actually acting on behalf of</text>
  <text start="461.09" dur="7.79">the American people they&amp;#39;re not and that</text>
  <text start="466.37" dur="5.34">most of the time they are lying to us</text>
  <text start="468.88" dur="7.18">everything that they tell us is a lie</text>
  <text start="471.71" dur="7.679">in fact they change history books time</text>
  <text start="476.06" dur="10.409">and time again in order to shape the</text>
  <text start="479.389" dur="9.71">narrative that they want us to know but</text>
  <text start="486.469" dur="8.88">we&amp;#39;re not falling for that anymore now</text>
  <text start="489.099" dur="8.44">we can see through their lives so this</text>
  <text start="495.349" dur="4.201">an an on had said the web link won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="497.539" dur="3.81">open and then Q would respond to that</text>
  <text start="499.55" dur="4.76">and said anton&amp;#39;s crash the site</text>
  <text start="501.349" dur="7.79">high-volume traffic the Great Awakening</text>
  <text start="504.31" dur="8.979">exactly so so many people had tried to</text>
  <text start="509.139" dur="6.491">activate that link that it crashed that</text>
  <text start="513.289" dur="6.601">should tell you how many people were</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="7.769">actually looking at that it was no small</text>
  <text start="519.89" dur="5.79">potatoes alright so the next one there</text>
  <text start="523.399" dur="5.19">is a Twitter status from John Brennan</text>
  <text start="525.68" dur="4.38">who&amp;#39;s constantly screaming at this point</text>
  <text start="528.589" dur="4.351">and we know those who yell the loudest</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="5.31">and so then Q says thank you for</text>
  <text start="532.94" dur="4.95">confirming Coates bad Ratcliffe good</text>
  <text start="535.37" dur="5.67">sleepers present problems regarding</text>
  <text start="537.89" dur="6">staff Bills more coming so in this</text>
  <text start="541.04" dur="4.859">Twitter status John Brennan had said Dan</text>
  <text start="543.89" dur="4.56">Coates served ably and with deep</text>
  <text start="545.899" dur="4.861">integrity Ratcliffe showed abject</text>
  <text start="548.45" dur="4.32">subservience to trump in miller hearings</text>
  <text start="550.76" dur="3.75">the women and men in the intelligence</text>
  <text start="552.77" dur="3.78">community deserve a leader like Coates</text>
  <text start="554.51" dur="5.47">who puts nation first not a servile</text>
  <text start="556.55" dur="7.52">Trump loyalists like Ratcliffe now</text>
  <text start="559.98" dur="7.75">John Brennan is afraid of coats being</text>
  <text start="564.07" dur="6.63">replaced by anyone else because coats</text>
  <text start="567.73" dur="4.86">was one of them he was corrupt too and</text>
  <text start="570.7" dur="6.84">we&amp;#39;ve known for a while that coats was</text>
  <text start="572.59" dur="6.3">going to be leaving John Brennan knows</text>
  <text start="577.54" dur="2.94">he&amp;#39;s going to be on the under the</text>
  <text start="578.89" dur="3.12">microscope especially with John</text>
  <text start="580.48" dur="4.56">Ratcliffe coming in now I mentioned</text>
  <text start="582.01" dur="9.63">earlier that Ratcliffe had made some</text>
  <text start="585.04" dur="9.8">very good points in the molar hearing so</text>
  <text start="591.64" dur="6.42">while John Brennan here is saying that</text>
  <text start="594.84" dur="5.68">Ratcliffe had showed subservience to</text>
  <text start="598.06" dur="5.49">Trump no he didn&amp;#39;t everything that he</text>
  <text start="600.52" dur="6.69">said during his questioning had to do</text>
  <text start="603.55" dur="5.64">with telling Muller and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="607.21" dur="9.06">American people what the law actually</text>
  <text start="609.19" dur="9.63">says you cannot you do not have to</text>
  <text start="616.27" dur="5.01">exonerate someone because there is a</text>
  <text start="618.82" dur="7.8">presumption of innocence this is the</text>
  <text start="621.28" dur="7.95">constitutional law basic law innocent</text>
  <text start="626.62" dur="6.09">until proven guilty burden of proof is</text>
  <text start="629.23" dur="8.43">on the prosecution and so John Radcliffe</text>
  <text start="632.71" dur="7.2">had to spell that out for everyone so he</text>
  <text start="637.66" dur="4.56">wasn&amp;#39;t acting like a trump loyalist he</text>
  <text start="639.91" dur="4.02">was acting like someone who wants to</text>
  <text start="642.22" dur="6.21">preserve the integrity of what the law</text>
  <text start="643.93" dur="10.59">actually is and that&amp;#39;s why John Brennan</text>
  <text start="648.43" dur="9.12">is so opposed to Ratcliffe alright the</text>
  <text start="654.52" dur="7.74">next one and Anan says ray is a sleeper</text>
  <text start="657.55" dur="8.31">and then Q says future marker now some</text>
  <text start="662.26" dur="5.85">people say that Ray is a bad guy that</text>
  <text start="665.86" dur="4.71">he&amp;#39;s not doing anything he&amp;#39;s not doing</text>
  <text start="668.11" dur="5.22">anything to clean out the FBI he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="670.57" dur="5.82">dodging questions and all of this but</text>
  <text start="673.33" dur="6.15">Hugh had mentioned a long time ago that</text>
  <text start="676.39" dur="5.76">we should trust ray trust ray trust</text>
  <text start="679.48" dur="7.32">sessions trust Huber trusts all these</text>
  <text start="682.15" dur="7.32">people I have thought from the very</text>
  <text start="686.8" dur="4.92">beginning that Huber was a good guy in</text>
  <text start="689.47" dur="5.14">sessions was a good guy</text>
  <text start="691.72" dur="4.81">even though they&amp;#39;re not acting as</text>
  <text start="694.61" dur="5.4">quickly and openly as some people would</text>
  <text start="696.53" dur="6.18">like so same thing you know if there is</text>
  <text start="700.01" dur="6.09">a trust in Huber in sessions and there</text>
  <text start="702.71" dur="4.97">supposed to be a trust in Rey I think</text>
  <text start="706.1" dur="5.88">Rey is a good guy</text>
  <text start="707.68" dur="7.56">now this anon says that Rey is a sleeper</text>
  <text start="711.98" dur="8.39">and Q is basically confirming that and</text>
  <text start="715.24" dur="7.9">marking this a sleeper cell a sleeper is</text>
  <text start="720.37" dur="6.04">someone who is not activated yet</text>
  <text start="723.14" dur="4.95">someone who&amp;#39;s laying dormant basically</text>
  <text start="726.41" dur="3.54">not doing anything so they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="728.09" dur="4.5">anything because they&amp;#39;re not supposed to</text>
  <text start="729.95" dur="6.6">be then they&amp;#39;re activated so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="732.59" dur="5.07">waiting for an activation point so</text>
  <text start="736.55" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s doing he&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="737.66" dur="4.65">floundering around really stalling not</text>
  <text start="739.94" dur="4.07">doing much because he&amp;#39;s not supposed to</text>
  <text start="742.31" dur="5.3">do anything it&amp;#39;s not his time yet</text>
  <text start="744.01" dur="7.45">everything is about timing in this game</text>
  <text start="747.61" dur="9.94">all right the next one there&amp;#39;s a picture</text>
  <text start="751.46" dur="10.01">of three different men from the US Naval</text>

  <text start="1731.349" dur="5.21">really difficult to choke yourself I</text>
  <text start="1733.769" dur="5.23">mean I guess you could do it to a point</text>
  <text start="1736.559" dur="4.72">you know so that I&amp;#39;m really still on the</text>
  <text start="1738.999" dur="4.591">fence about because I think it&amp;#39;s highly</text>
  <text start="1741.279" dur="3.9">unlikely that you&amp;#39;re going to choke</text>
  <text start="1743.59" dur="3.6">yourself to death where you kill</text>

  <text start="1765.409" dur="4.321">inside if they wanted to so that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1767.75" dur="2.88">Jeffrey Epstein has to be under 24-hour</text>

  <text start="1770.63" dur="6.149">and from not doing it already I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1773.21" dur="8.719">know why they wouldn&amp;#39;t because he&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="1898.82" dur="4.05">Justice don&amp;#39;t get me wrong I think one</text>
  <text start="1900.44" dur="4.59">of the challenges is we had several acts</text>
  <text start="1902.87" dur="4.68">that appeared to be politically</text>
  <text start="1905.03" dur="3.9">motivated and I think I think the</text>
  <text start="1907.55" dur="3.57">Attorney General Barnes gonna figure</text>
  <text start="1908.93" dur="4.2">this out and he&amp;#39;s going to do look at</text>
  <text start="1911.12" dur="3.36">the genesis of this investigation</text>
  <text start="1913.13" dur="2.79">he&amp;#39;s got John Durham looking at that</text>
  <text start="1914.48" dur="3.72">who&amp;#39;s a US Attorney out of Connecticut</text>
  <text start="1915.92" dur="3.81">he&amp;#39;s going to prosecute anybody that</text>

  <text start="1919.73" dur="3.18">have Huber out there looking at some of</text>
  <text start="1921.11" dur="3.36">these things regarding commis memos and</text>
  <text start="1922.91" dur="3.39">the like and so I just think there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1924.47" dur="3.96">lot of things that bill Barr is gonna be</text>
  <text start="1926.3" dur="4.2">bringing to a conclusion here and since</text>
  <text start="1928.43" dur="4.23">the Molen investigation is over now and</text>
  <text start="1930.5" dur="3.48">now we can focus on some of these</text>
  <text start="1932.66" dur="2.79">questions and I think the American</text>
  <text start="1933.98" dur="3.21">people have a right to know as to how</text>
  <text start="1935.45" dur="3.41">these investigation started and whether</text>
  <text start="1937.19" dur="3.51">any of them were politically motivated</text>
  <text start="1938.86" dur="4.66">on rackleff he will not have</text>
  <text start="1940.7" dur="5.1">prosecutorial powers but if it is found</text>
  <text start="1943.52" dur="4.77">that laws were broken bill bar will</text>
  <text start="1945.8" dur="5.85">prosecute bill bars the person now what</text>
  <text start="1948.29" dur="5.13">what Ratcliffe can do it the DNI is he</text>
  <text start="1951.65" dur="4.47">can look at sort of the entire</text>
  <text start="1953.42" dur="6">intelligence community and see and see</text>
  <text start="1956.12" dur="5.13">if there were systemic failures for how</text>
  <text start="1959.42" dur="4.41">these investigations were kicked off and</text>
  <text start="1961.25" dur="5.37">some of the issues with Papadopoulos and</text>
  <text start="1963.83" dur="4.08">others and and how other countries were</text>
  <text start="1966.62" dur="3.48">interacted with so I think it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="1967.91" dur="4.62">very interesting but with barn rackleff</text>
  <text start="1970.1" dur="4.26">both working these angles they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="1972.53" dur="3.39">perfect and of course Democrats dismiss</text>
  <text start="1974.36" dur="3.93">this investigation imagine that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1975.92" dur="4.35">gotten political but I mean the politics</text>

  <text start="2011.65" dur="2.87">we don&amp;#39;t know and I think this is very</text>
  <text start="2013.27" dur="3.14">important this is where the</text>

  <text start="2143.69" dur="11.399">rather neutrally so that the facts are</text>

  <text start="2155.089" dur="6.99">not public opinion which again is really</text>
  <text start="2159.47" dur="7.23">what the molar investigation was it was</text>
