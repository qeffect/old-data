  <text start="190.38" dur="5.13">beginning to have progress on this and</text>
  <text start="192.87" dur="6.27">the plan is in motion</text>
  <text start="195.51" dur="6.839">3702 so we have the Senate must be</text>
  <text start="199.14" dur="5.97">unrestricted to conduct other important</text>
  <text start="202.349" dur="5.581">business now that could be like</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="6.09">impeachment or it could be other things</text>
  <text start="207.93" dur="7.47">like the FBI being brought to justice</text>
  <text start="211.2" dur="6.95">that the deep state crimes coup d&amp;#39;etat</text>
  <text start="215.4" dur="5.49">the FISA abuses these things could be</text>
  <text start="218.15" dur="4.26">dealt with in a Senate trial but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="220.89" dur="4.26">stuck on impeachment right now because</text>
  <text start="222.41" dur="5.439">what they&amp;#39;re doing so he says if</text>
  <text start="225.15" dur="4.919">Democrats knew Senate would not vote to</text>
  <text start="227.849" dur="3.991">convict why proceed because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.069" dur="3.901">another reason they want to proceed with</text>
  <text start="231.84" dur="3.179">impeachment it&amp;#39;s not just to try to you</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="3.69">know get votes because they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="235.019" dur="4.5">votes and it&amp;#39;s not just to try to</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="3.449">impeach Trump because they can&amp;#39;t win</text>
  <text start="239.519" dur="3.81">they know that they can&amp;#39;t win in fact</text>
  <text start="241.109" dur="4.35">the the odds of their getting an</text>
  <text start="243.329" dur="5.431">impeachment through go down every day as</text>
  <text start="245.459" dur="5.101">more Democrats abandon ship and the more</text>
  <text start="248.76" dur="3.96">independents Adar definitely abandoning</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="6.75">they&amp;#39;re just pushing them right into</text>
  <text start="252.72" dur="6.84">Trump&amp;#39;s arms but he says how does it how</text>
  <text start="257.31" dur="5.52">long does a typical Senate impeachment</text>
  <text start="259.56" dur="4.5">trial take and I I don&amp;#39;t know the answer</text>
  <text start="262.83" dur="3.809">to that but it could take quite a while</text>
  <text start="264.06" dur="5.78">I&amp;#39;m sure at least months can the Senate</text>
  <text start="266.639" dur="4.471">conduct other business during this time</text>
  <text start="269.84" dur="3.28">No</text>
  <text start="271.11" dur="4.59">so this would tell you right there that</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="4.08">if they can if they can stall the queue</text>
  <text start="275.7" dur="3.899">if they can kind of hold up the line</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="3.87">with impeachment impeachment then no one</text>
  <text start="279.599" dur="4.081">gets in the building no one gets to go</text>
  <text start="281.07" dur="4.5">see this movie and this is a dead</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="4.2">non-starter because you can&amp;#39;t even get</text>
  <text start="285.57" dur="5.159">it to a Senate trial so they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="287.88" dur="5.009">to block their own investigations coming</text>
  <text start="290.729" dur="6.931">out by looking into Trump with this</text>
  <text start="292.889" dur="6.75">impeachment Fiasco clown show so q says</text>
  <text start="297.66" dur="3.42">what value might this have for Democrats</text>
  <text start="299.639" dur="2.761">well like I just said they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="301.08" dur="4.23">stay out of jail they&amp;#39;re trying to stay</text>
  <text start="302.4" dur="5.55">out of Gitmo which has been upgraded</text>
  <text start="305.31" dur="4.829">ready for them for their treasonous coup</text>
  <text start="307.95" dur="5.61">d&amp;#39;etat crimes against Americans</text>
  <text start="310.139" dur="5.761">so Barr and Durham working in secret the</text>
  <text start="313.56" dur="4.079">answer to that is yes until very</text>
  <text start="315.9" dur="3.12">recently some of its come out you know</text>
  <text start="317.639" dur="3.96">Barr is now making more public</text>
  <text start="319.02" dur="4.769">statements but yeah for the most part</text>
  <text start="321.599" dur="6.301">they&amp;#39;re still working in secret Senate</text>
  <text start="323.789" dur="5.701">working openly I would say that for the</text>
  <text start="327.9" dur="3.269">most part yeah</text>
  <text start="329.49" dur="4.14">you&amp;#39;ve got a pretty good Grassley&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.169" dur="6.47">being pretty blunt with the media about</text>
  <text start="333.63" dur="7.64">this and with the Democrats we also have</text>
  <text start="337.639" dur="9.581">value of public learning the truth prior</text>
  <text start="341.27" dur="9.19">to I understood seal propaganda push</text>
  <text start="347.22" dur="4.44">failing so you know we know that there</text>
  <text start="350.46" dur="3.389">are different things that will be</text>
  <text start="351.66" dur="6.379">unsealed including some of these</text>
  <text start="353.849" dur="6.841">possibly classified file things but the</text>
  <text start="358.039" dur="5.56">the unsealing is going to be I guess</text>
  <text start="360.69" dur="5.55">whatever Trump decides to to push that</text>
  <text start="363.599" dur="5.641">but the value of people learning about</text>
  <text start="366.24" dur="5.85">it prior to the unsealing would make it</text>
  <text start="369.24" dur="5.79">seem as though it was confirmation of</text>
  <text start="372.09" dur="5.1">their own beliefs rather than something</text>
  <text start="375.03" dur="4.169">being pushed on them by others and you</text>
  <text start="377.19" dur="3.39">know we&amp;#39;ve talked about how to read pill</text>
  <text start="379.199" dur="3.631">people and things like that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="380.58" dur="4.29">better using the for example the</text>
  <text start="382.83" dur="4.5">Socratic method like you does to let</text>
  <text start="384.87" dur="4.47">them come to it on their own you&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="387.33" dur="4.11">better retention you&amp;#39;ll get better</text>
  <text start="389.34" dur="3.509">interest you&amp;#39;ll get people that are not</text>
  <text start="391.44" dur="3.87">as threatened because they were wrong</text>
  <text start="392.849" dur="3.991">about something they can find out that</text>
  <text start="395.31" dur="2.94">they were wrong on their own and then</text>
  <text start="396.84" dur="3.84">they can change their own mind without</text>
  <text start="398.25" dur="5.25">having any you know defensiveness about</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="7.489">it or E or any hurt egos or or any you</text>
  <text start="403.5" dur="8.55">know offended natures so we also have</text>
  <text start="408.169" dur="6.131">propaganda push failing transparency and</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="3.839">accountability is the only way and I</text>
  <text start="414.3" dur="3.989">love that that this is something that</text>
  <text start="415.889" dur="4.201">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;ve been promoting pretty</text>
  <text start="418.289" dur="3.66">much the entire Q movement clean the</text>
  <text start="420.09" dur="4.049">house we need transparency it&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="421.949" dur="4.291">way things like that and I&amp;#39;ve been a big</text>
  <text start="424.139" dur="4.411">fan of that as well I kind of want to</text>
  <text start="426.24" dur="5.519">create a website that tracks all of the</text>
  <text start="428.55" dur="5.28">deception among not just the magum</text>
  <text start="431.759" dur="4.951">movement but you know the idea is to</text>
  <text start="433.83" dur="4.619">expose the fake Magga as liars but kind</text>
  <text start="436.71" dur="3.959">of like all public figures you know any</text>
  <text start="438.449" dur="5.431">public figure in the media or politics</text>
  <text start="440.669" dur="5.671">that is out there trying to lead people</text>
  <text start="443.88" dur="4.379">well maybe all of their dirt and and</text>
  <text start="446.34" dur="4.799">their you know all of that all the</text>
  <text start="448.259" dur="4.59">allegations can be you know listed in</text>
  <text start="451.139" dur="3.391">one place where everyone can see and</text>
  <text start="452.849" dur="3.75">kind of get to know this person and</text>
  <text start="454.53" dur="5.1">what&amp;#39;s being said about them and then</text>
  <text start="456.599" dur="5.011">they can reply in rebut or confirm you</text>
  <text start="459.63" dur="3.09">know either way if it&amp;#39;s not true then</text>
  <text start="461.61" dur="3.54">rebutted if it&amp;#39;s if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.72" dur="3.75">true then ignore it or confirm it and</text>
  <text start="465.15" dur="5.1">then we will have sort of a public</text>
  <text start="466.47" dur="6.93">dossier on everyone and at that point it</text>
  <text start="470.25" dur="4.23">won&amp;#39;t be about just what the you know</text>
  <text start="473.4" dur="3.15">the deep state you want to bring out</text>
  <text start="474.48" dur="4.26">about people will know the truth about</text>
  <text start="476.55" dur="4.62">people at least as much as we can with</text>
  <text start="478.74" dur="4.32">public information down to their very</text>
  <text start="481.17" dur="3.9">character and I think that would be very</text>
  <text start="483.06" dur="3.78">good for the queue movement for the</text>
  <text start="485.07" dur="4.02">magum movement for the political</text>
  <text start="486.84" dur="4.68">transparency movement for the for the</text>
  <text start="489.09" dur="5.94">open media movement I think transparency</text>
  <text start="491.52" dur="7.74">and accountability is the only way askew</text>
  <text start="495.03" dur="6.24">does so forward to save the Republic Wow</text>
  <text start="499.26" dur="3.66">so I guess that&amp;#39;s one tenet so</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="3.6">transparency and accountability is the</text>
  <text start="502.92" dur="4.91">only way forward to save the Republic</text>

  <text start="620.93" dur="5.969">gap are in very close to em but</text>
  <text start="624.769" dur="4.62">completely different as the kerning oh</text>
  <text start="626.899" dur="5.221">that&amp;#39;s the word kerning only in the name</text>
  <text start="629.389" dur="7.86">call me or corny as the kerning reduced</text>
  <text start="632.12" dur="7.139">to look like M so I think she&amp;#39;s got iPod</text>
  <text start="637.249" dur="7.5">here has images of it let&amp;#39;s check this</text>
  <text start="639.259" dur="7.711">out so since it&amp;#39;s so big I can kind of</text>
  <text start="644.749" dur="3.78">make it very easy and I don&amp;#39;t know I</text>
  <text start="646.97" dur="2.309">don&amp;#39;t think the kerning here has been</text>
  <text start="648.529" dur="4.56">changed</text>
  <text start="649.279" dur="6.78">I don&amp;#39;t yeah so basically you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="653.089" dur="6.661">seeing that the space had been moved</text>
  <text start="656.059" dur="5.28">right here between the R in the end and</text>
  <text start="659.75" dur="4.019">this is in the document maybe not in</text>
  <text start="661.339" dur="4.68">this particular file but in the document</text>
  <text start="663.769" dur="4.981">the space had been almost completely</text>
  <text start="666.019" dur="4.11">gapped and removed now the kerning is</text>
  <text start="668.75" dur="2.879">the word for the I think the space</text>
  <text start="670.129" dur="4.56">between the letters and there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="671.629" dur="5.88">word I think called spread or track or</text>
  <text start="674.689" dur="4.291">something where it actually controls</text>
  <text start="677.509" dur="3.27">sort of the space between all the</text>
  <text start="678.98" dur="3.919">different letters so like the whole</text>
  <text start="680.779" dur="4.43">sentence would be kind of equally spaced</text>
  <text start="682.899" dur="5.29">so what you&amp;#39;re seeing here is a specific</text>
  <text start="685.209" dur="4.781">kerning just inserted into the middle of</text>
  <text start="688.189" dur="4.26">the sentence not the whole sentence not</text>
  <text start="689.99" dur="4.8">every space was affected but just that</text>
  <text start="692.449" dur="6.36">one that&amp;#39;s what they did in the document</text>
  <text start="694.79" dur="6.87">so it&amp;#39;s very interesting to see that</text>
  <text start="698.809" dur="5.431">they are tinkering with this in a way</text>
  <text start="701.66" dur="4.44">that only reinforces the cue movement</text>
  <text start="704.24" dur="4.56">whether intentionally or not cue knew</text>
  <text start="706.1" dur="6.02">about this a year ago or more so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="708.8" dur="7.68">the hell of a thing right there so</text>
  <text start="712.12" dur="5.889">continuing on to 3704 or the I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="716.48" dur="6.71">already there remember misspellings</text>
  <text start="718.009" dur="8.671">matter and he said Durham 5-3 1-9</text>
  <text start="723.19" dur="4.66">so we&amp;#39;ve had in the past a lot of kuma</text>
  <text start="726.68" dur="2.82">Spelling&amp;#39;s and sometimes he&amp;#39;ll correct</text>
  <text start="727.85" dur="4.32">himself and say oh that was just an</text>
  <text start="729.5" dur="5.91">actual typo or an accident but sometimes</text>
  <text start="732.17" dur="4.859">he won&amp;#39;t and like for example a year ago</text>
  <text start="735.41" dur="4.109">when he said corny</text>
  <text start="737.029" dur="5.31">James 8 corny instead of James be</text>
  <text start="739.519" dur="6.891">calming he knew about this he knew about</text>
  <text start="742.339" dur="6.87">all of this so we also have 3705</text>
  <text start="746.41" dur="6.549">national presidential alert system and</text>
  <text start="749.209" dur="6.901">this is a two in a kill box why was this</text>
  <text start="752.959" dur="5.851">created and tested political warfare and</text>
  <text start="756.11" dur="5.159">information warfare what this means is</text>
  <text start="758.81" dur="4.98">we needed a way to get around fake news</text>
  <text start="761.269" dur="4.401">and big tech if they pull the kill</text>
  <text start="763.79" dur="5.729">switch they could just shut down</text>
  <text start="765.67" dur="4.99">Facebook Twitter and YouTube because</text>
  <text start="769.519" dur="3.031">that&amp;#39;s probably what they would prefer</text>
  <text start="770.66" dur="4.53">to do rather than us having an open</text>
  <text start="772.55" dur="4.589">platform to spread the truth media right</text>
  <text start="775.19" dur="3.75">like if they can&amp;#39;t have it no one will</text>
  <text start="777.139" dur="2.911">they would rather just shut down the</text>
  <text start="778.94" dur="3">whole damn company</text>
  <text start="780.05" dur="3.599">or at least make changes so that it</text>
  <text start="781.94" dur="3.959">would ruin that aspect of the company</text>
  <text start="783.649" dur="3.81">like YouTube is doing destroying the</text>
  <text start="785.899" dur="3.361">independent media aspect hurting their</text>
  <text start="787.459" dur="3.81">own business losing seventy billion</text>
  <text start="789.26" dur="3.389">dollars market cap to alphabet hurting</text>
  <text start="791.269" dur="4.701">their own stockholders they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="792.649" dur="5.851">they want to win politically so</text>
  <text start="795.97" dur="5.32">companies doing that could easily just</text>
  <text start="798.5" dur="4.529">pull the plug and then make it up for it</text>
  <text start="801.29" dur="3.18">be like killing our communication system</text>
  <text start="803.029" dur="3.961">you&amp;#39;d be like destroying our coms</text>
  <text start="804.47" dur="4.919">it would throw the magma movement into</text>
  <text start="806.99" dur="5.339">disarray for a short time and that might</text>
  <text start="809.389" dur="4.981">be enough for them so if that happens I</text>
  <text start="812.329" dur="4.981">think President Trump is going to text</text>
  <text start="814.37" dur="4.829">us and you know the left is not a big</text>
  <text start="817.31" dur="3.63">fan of that they were not happy about</text>
  <text start="819.199" dur="3.361">that they they fought against it when</text>
  <text start="820.94" dur="3.75">this presidential alert system was</text>
  <text start="822.56" dur="4.74">inning tested I think it was almost a</text>
  <text start="824.69" dur="4.649">year ago now maybe more but I look</text>
  <text start="827.3" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s necessary and if that</text>
  <text start="829.339" dur="3.961">happens and it&amp;#39;s not gonna be a good</text>
  <text start="831.17" dur="3.84">thing and destroy many youtube channels</text>
  <text start="833.3" dur="4.8">for example at least president Trump can</text>
  <text start="835.01" dur="7.62">still tell us what&amp;#39;s happening so we</text>
  <text start="838.1" dur="8.729">have here Cornie 480 times call me zero</text>
  <text start="842.63" dur="6.09">times now that&amp;#39;s a hell of a coincidence</text>
  <text start="846.829" dur="5.221">right there mathematically speaking if</text>
  <text start="848.72" dur="6.739">they were to make the accident 480 times</text>
  <text start="852.05" dur="5.629">so what is going on here and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="855.459" dur="4.92">all he says it&amp;#39;s just a funny picture</text>
  <text start="857.679" dur="5.52">and in this picture is of course meant I</text>
  <text start="860.379" dur="5.49">know the left tries to make the Pepe the</text>
  <text start="863.199" dur="4.95">Frog thing a look racist it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="865.869" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s green for a reason because it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="869.679" dur="5.27">kind of relate to in a sense it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="872.29" dur="6.149">like the the avatar of the independent</text>

  <text start="897.1" dur="5.31">going through it and you guys know that</text>

  <text start="1494.919" dur="4.411">correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong about that and</text>
  <text start="1496.6" dur="5.819">the call me report was was not as big</text>

  <text start="1761.3" dur="4.44">here maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong but as I understand</text>

  <text start="1896.09" dur="4.38">possible and we need you now more than</text>
  <text start="1898.309" dur="4.74">ever because our voices are being cut</text>
  <text start="1900.47" dur="4.73">off so this is where we we stand</text>
  <text start="1903.049" dur="6.391">together or fall apart you know this is</text>
  <text start="1905.2" dur="6.91">your fall one by one and stop it burning</text>
  <text start="1909.44" dur="4.26">calm is where we can kind of do</text>
  <text start="1912.11" dur="4.199">something about that and make a stand</text>
  <text start="1913.7" dur="5.459">where free speech makes a stand and we</text>
  <text start="1916.309" dur="5.701">have a super lawyer we have you know</text>
  <text start="1919.159" dur="6.15">possibly even a whistleblower on the ins</text>
  <text start="1922.01" dur="5.58">I mean we have what we need to take them</text>
  <text start="1925.309" dur="5.401">to court and win we even have the</text>
  <text start="1927.59" dur="6">numbers quite possibly soon to start the</text>
  <text start="1930.71" dur="4.349">fundraising and to actually to do this I</text>
  <text start="1933.59" dur="3.839">mean this is going to be incredibly</text>
  <text start="1935.059" dur="4.971">expensive but with millions of people</text>
  <text start="1937.429" dur="4.771">behind it we can do that and we can win</text>
  <text start="1940.03" dur="4.81">anyway so many hands make light work</text>
  <text start="1942.2" dur="4.38">moving on to the next Q post here</text>
  <text start="1944.84" dur="3.6">general Flynn might just be freed soon</text>
  <text start="1946.58" dur="4.65">although we do know and I recorded on</text>
  <text start="1948.44" dur="6.54">this that the judge there Sullivan</text>
  <text start="1951.23" dur="6.18">Emmett Sullivan rejected general Flynn</text>

  <text start="1962.62" dur="5.559">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an unfortunate to see that</text>
  <text start="1965.299" dur="5.971">happen however we also heard recent</text>
  <text start="1968.179" dur="6.12">rumor that some of that information is</text>
  <text start="1971.27" dur="6.72">still being used in a grand jury</text>
  <text start="1974.299" dur="7.141">so maybe the FISA stuff for Flynn is not</text>
  <text start="1977.99" dur="5.25">ready to be undone maybe they still I</text>
  <text start="1981.44" dur="4.109">don&amp;#39;t know and I don&amp;#39;t know what the</text>
  <text start="1983.24" dur="4.92">investigation is covering but perhaps</text>
  <text start="1985.549" dur="4.291">there is a reason for it so maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1988.16" dur="4.83">not worth being as discouraged over and</text>
  <text start="1989.84" dur="5.55">I generally I genuinely do not believe</text>
  <text start="1992.99" dur="7.14">that general Flynn will end up in jail</text>

  <text start="2525.22" dur="5.46">the way but when this happens it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2528.82" dur="3.93">prove the cube movement was right all</text>
  <text start="2530.68" dur="4.14">along and that&amp;#39;s the point I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="2532.75" dur="7.55">make it&amp;#39;s gonna prove that the queue</text>
  <text start="2534.82" dur="8.49">movement is going to end up with arrests</text>
  <text start="2540.3" dur="4.809">you know in that video I made asking if</text>
  <text start="2543.31" dur="4.38">Alex Jones was gonna end up in Gitmo</text>
  <text start="2545.109" dur="4.441">because Hugh said nobody who plays the</text>

  <text start="2549.55" dur="3.84">triggered him by the way that&amp;#39;s when he</text>
  <text start="2550.78" dur="4.86">got mad at me and spent 45 minutes the</text>
  <text start="2553.39" dur="4.969">next day on Owen shroyer talking about</text>
  <text start="2555.64" dur="5.88">how I made him cry in front of his kids</text>
  <text start="2558.359" dur="4.811">that chapter is I wrote about that story</text>
  <text start="2561.52" dur="6.54">in the Q book by the way on the book of</text>
  <text start="2563.17" dur="7.38">Q on calm but uh anyway kind of</text>
  <text start="2568.06" dur="4.77">continuing on this will prove the Q</text>
  <text start="2570.55" dur="4.65">movement to so many people that are in</text>
  <text start="2572.83" dur="4.71">that limbo space of knowing about it but</text>
  <text start="2575.2" dur="4.47">not truly believing in it they will get</text>
  <text start="2577.54" dur="5.61">energetic like we are they will get</text>
  <text start="2579.67" dur="5.73">excited like I am will have so many new</text>
  <text start="2583.15" dur="3.06">voices join independent media that we</text>
  <text start="2585.4" dur="3.99">will</text>
  <text start="2586.21" dur="6.26">overwhelm the dying fake media corporate</text>
  <text start="2589.39" dur="8.31">you know establishment globalist</text>
  <text start="2592.47" dur="7.24">Democrat sellout media and it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="2597.7" dur="4.649">biblical especially when censorship</text>
  <text start="2599.71" dur="4.26">itself is beaten we that&amp;#39;s the big thing</text>
  <text start="2602.349" dur="9.031">now that&amp;#39;s the big threat the only</text>
  <text start="2603.97" dur="12.41">threat left is censorship now continuing</text>
  <text start="2611.38" dur="7.53">on they will fight but you are ready</text>
  <text start="2616.38" dur="6.25">well I mean look at the recent polls</text>
  <text start="2618.91" dur="6.48">coming out most of the country does not</text>
  <text start="2622.63" dur="5.34">agree with impeachment most of the</text>
  <text start="2625.39" dur="4.77">independents now and even about thirty</text>
  <text start="2627.97" dur="4.889">percent and growing of the Democrats are</text>
  <text start="2630.16" dur="6.26">against impeachment being pushed further</text>
  <text start="2632.859" dur="7.411">and further to the right and to Tromp</text>
  <text start="2636.42" dur="6.79">because the left the the shree ever</text>
  <text start="2640.27" dur="4.62">shrinking radical left is in their tiny</text>
  <text start="2643.21" dur="5.129">little echo chamber which is getting</text>
  <text start="2644.89" dur="5.07">smaller every day are just going too far</text>
  <text start="2648.339" dur="6.061">they&amp;#39;re running full speed to the left</text>
  <text start="2649.96" dur="7.379">and to impeachment and to deep state re</text>
  <text start="2654.4" dur="6.48">and that&amp;#39;s the problem here so Q says</text>
  <text start="2657.339" dur="5.52">marker nine so we&amp;#39;re ready because we</text>
  <text start="2660.88" dur="5.37">have the majority of the population the</text>
  <text start="2662.859" dur="5.341">optics are finally there and and frankly</text>
  <text start="2666.25" dur="5.16">I think you know that has always been</text>
  <text start="2668.2" dur="6.45">our burden to get it to that point Hugh</text>
  <text start="2671.41" dur="4.679">did his part prompted his part but or Q</text>
  <text start="2674.65" dur="4.53">team did their part and Trump did his</text>
  <text start="2676.089" dur="6.121">part but we the independent media had to</text>
  <text start="2679.18" dur="5.879">get it to the point where people were</text>
  <text start="2682.21" dur="5.7">ready for the truth they were ready the</text>
  <text start="2685.059" dur="6.27">Overton Window has shifted enough that</text>
  <text start="2687.91" dur="5.76">people were ready to have these arrests</text>
  <text start="2691.329" dur="3.96">couldn&amp;#39;t have done this early on even if</text>
  <text start="2693.67" dur="2.75">you had the court stacked people weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2695.289" dur="4.351">ready for it</text>
  <text start="2696.42" dur="9.03">so that was why we had to be patient</text>
  <text start="2699.64" dur="5.81">part of it so continuing to 3717</text>
  <text start="2705.869" dur="3.011">somebody told me a funny thing in chat</text>

  <text start="2755.33" dur="4.62">what we&amp;#39;re doing here as independent</text>
  <text start="2757.1" dur="4.5">media as pro-q independent media which</text>
  <text start="2759.95" dur="4.38">is a totally different thing and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2761.6" dur="4.17">not easy to pull off by the way you take</text>
  <text start="2764.33" dur="5.34">a lot of flack for being in the queue</text>
  <text start="2765.77" dur="6.54">movement from a large group of sort of</text>
  <text start="2769.67" dur="4.56">mainstream people but at the same point</text>
  <text start="2772.31" dur="5.16">I think I bring reason and evidence and</text>
  <text start="2774.23" dur="5.1">and kind of a logical factor to at least</text>
  <text start="2777.47" dur="4.41">my interpretations of the queue post</text>
  <text start="2779.33" dur="5.82">that that don&amp;#39;t kind of go out into the</text>

  <text start="2804.92" dur="5.34">and I&amp;#39;ve shown that in the past but you</text>
  <text start="2808.34" dur="3.09">know maybe that maybe he&amp;#39;s a decoy and</text>
  <text start="2810.26" dur="3.18">there really is another one out there I</text>

  <text start="2821.36" dur="6.18">they they ridicule it into making normal</text>
