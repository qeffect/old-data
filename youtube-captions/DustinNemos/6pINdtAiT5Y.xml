  <text start="0.86" dur="6.85">welcome my friends to my home away from</text>
  <text start="3.72" dur="6.629">home this is my family castle where you</text>
  <text start="7.71" dur="4.71">better know but this this actually is a</text>
  <text start="10.349" dur="4.561">house my grandfather built and he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="12.42" dur="3.779">all kinds of things some of them he</text>
  <text start="14.91" dur="2.61">built some of them he didn&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;ll show</text>
  <text start="16.199" dur="3.691">you guys some of that stuff on my trip</text>
  <text start="17.52" dur="4.71">but anyway I wanted to wish everyone a</text>
  <text start="19.89" dur="4.44">happy 4th of July in my goofy blue light</text>
  <text start="22.23" dur="4.53">yeah glasses these are actually protect</text>
  <text start="24.33" dur="4.23">protect you from the screen I try not to</text>
  <text start="26.76" dur="6.42">wear them all the time but on this</text>
  <text start="28.56" dur="6.06">laptop is bad so happy 4th of July where</text>
  <text start="33.18" dur="3.09">we go on we go all that&amp;#39;s the biggest</text>
  <text start="34.62" dur="3.93">part of what I want to talk about and I</text>
  <text start="36.27" dur="4.59">also want to discuss this debate just</text>
  <text start="38.55" dur="4.11">briefly a lot of my viewers think this</text>
  <text start="40.86" dur="3.87">is some kind of petty drama and you know</text>
  <text start="42.66" dur="4.14">guys I&amp;#39;m not doing this for the petty I</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t have the time to do things for</text>
  <text start="46.8" dur="3.779">pettiness I don&amp;#39;t particularly care</text>
  <text start="49.17" dur="3.33">about the drama I&amp;#39;m actually already</text>
  <text start="50.579" dur="5.281">over I kind of already almost forgot</text>
  <text start="52.5" dur="4.77">about it it&amp;#39;s not the drama originally</text>
  <text start="55.86" dur="2.73">it&amp;#39;s not blankly attacks or anything</text>
  <text start="57.27" dur="3.87">like that a personal attacks that</text>
  <text start="58.59" dur="4.41">bothers me it&amp;#39;s the fact that people are</text>
  <text start="61.14" dur="3.809">spreading lies about the Q stuff and and</text>
  <text start="63" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s having some impact it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="3.301">slowing us down a little bit you know</text>
  <text start="66.36" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s causing a lot of confusion among</text>
  <text start="68.25" dur="3.6">people who in the truth or community who</text>
  <text start="70.2" dur="4.59">mean well it may not be that smart or</text>
  <text start="71.85" dur="5.07">may have maybe they have been just</text>
  <text start="74.79" dur="3.84">trusting the wrong people right and this</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="3.6">happens to everyone at some point I</text>
  <text start="78.63" dur="4.94">trusted Alex Jones and look where that</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="7.26">got me when it comes to queueing on so</text>
  <text start="83.57" dur="5.95">my reasons for this are one any practice</text>
  <text start="87.78" dur="5.22">at debating ok I&amp;#39;m kind of rusty and I</text>
  <text start="89.52" dur="5.459">like to stay sharp to to improve the</text>
  <text start="93" dur="4.29">queuing on community as a whole I think</text>
  <text start="94.979" dur="4.051">that having a debate video like this on</text>
  <text start="97.29" dur="4.17">the record where you can link it to</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="4.5">people who have some of the same doubts</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="4.56">that some of these people may be saying</text>
  <text start="103.53" dur="4.74">I think this will help I think I hope</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="6.059">that this can help the community I think</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="5.309">at the very least you know my opponents</text>
  <text start="112.079" dur="3.481">are hopefully gonna have to go and get a</text>
  <text start="113.579" dur="5.131">new argument right because I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="4.199">hopefully leave it so that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="2.43">gonna keep trying to use the same</text>
  <text start="119.759" dur="5.79">arguments over and over that&amp;#39;s my goal</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="6.45">and yeah I think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really it</text>
  <text start="125.549" dur="4.201">it&amp;#39;s more about you know the ultimate</text>
  <text start="127.59" dur="3.72">goal I want to win you know this is a</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="3.99">war and I want victory all I can think</text>
  <text start="131.31" dur="4.05">about is the bad guys doing the bad</text>
  <text start="133.74" dur="6.39">you know I don&amp;#39;t really particularly</text>
  <text start="135.36" dur="6.36">care about the I won&amp;#39;t say that like the</text>
  <text start="140.13" dur="2.46">true through community aspect of it</text>
  <text start="141.72" dur="2.31">because I obviously don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="142.59" dur="4.98">that that&amp;#39;s not the right way to say it</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="5.46">I don&amp;#39;t particularly care about the</text>
  <text start="147.57" dur="3.87">chaotic dissenting voices who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="149.49" dur="3.87">agree on what is self-evident</text>
  <text start="151.44" dur="3.3">you know like people who are out there</text>
  <text start="153.36" dur="2.7">at the fringe is trying to just draw</text>
  <text start="154.74" dur="2.67">people back from the crowd because</text>
  <text start="156.06" dur="3.21">you&amp;#39;re starting to focus on what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="157.41" dur="3.09">important and they&amp;#39;re in the back kind</text>
  <text start="159.27" dur="6.54">of like shouting no come over here</text>
  <text start="160.5" dur="8.76">listen to this it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a cacophony of</text>
  <text start="165.81" dur="4.92">chaotic voices out there and you know</text>
  <text start="169.26" dur="3.75">the best defense is to listen to many</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="4.08">people but who has the time that&amp;#39;s why I</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="4.65">try all my show to bring you guys as</text>
  <text start="174.81" dur="6.75">much information as I can and leave the</text>
  <text start="177.66" dur="6.12">ego out of it that said I think this</text>
  <text start="181.56" dur="4.65">debate will will do some good I hope it</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="3.63">will do some good and I&amp;#39;m looking</text>
  <text start="186.21" dur="2.88">forward to it</text>
  <text start="187.41" dur="3.45">now they&amp;#39;ve already did a debate without</text>
  <text start="189.09" dur="4.38">me apparently I guess I&amp;#39;m gonna call</text>
  <text start="190.86" dur="3.72">this politely at practice debate but you</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="2.64">know then they took to Twitter and</text>
  <text start="194.58" dur="2.97">Facebook and he didn&amp;#39;t show he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="196.11" dur="3.36">show everything else we&amp;#39;ll to explain</text>
  <text start="197.55" dur="3.39">that for those who may be doubting me I</text>
  <text start="199.47" dur="3.63">was on the road</text>
  <text start="200.94" dur="5.55">like I said 24-hour trip I had no idea</text>
  <text start="203.1" dur="6.9">they were even doing a debate like an</text>
  <text start="206.49" dur="5.07">instant without any kind of notice they</text>
  <text start="210" dur="3">sent me messages apparently I still</text>
  <text start="211.56" dur="2.67">haven&amp;#39;t checked them to even verify that</text>
  <text start="213" dur="4.62">but I&amp;#39;m sure that they tried to send me</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="4.38">some messages so obviously I couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="3.03">show up something I didn&amp;#39;t know about</text>
  <text start="218.61" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s not a legitimate debate when you</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="5.13">just throw up at which channel and then</text>
  <text start="223.26" dur="5.01">wait for someone to show up that is not</text>
  <text start="225.78" dur="4.32">how it works and to be honest to my</text>
  <text start="228.27" dur="4.89">opponents who I&amp;#39;m sure will watch this</text>
  <text start="230.1" dur="4.83">in the debate we need to find a</text>
  <text start="233.16" dur="3.45">moderator for one somebody who&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="5.97">basically keep the peace so there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="7.17">crosstalk and and and you know any kind</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="4.86">of drama it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be somebody</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="3.06">who is pro or against Q I think Jordan</text>
  <text start="245.76" dur="4.02">would be great I don&amp;#39;t know if he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="4.05">willing to do it I&amp;#39;ll check with him but</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="4.8">basically just somebody that we can</text>
  <text start="250.89" dur="6.69">trust not to uh to play sides or be</text>
  <text start="254.58" dur="4.14">immature and to keep keep a debate you</text>
  <text start="257.58" dur="2.25">know there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s rules to a debate</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="2.67">you have to kind of keep that like</text>
  <text start="259.83" dur="4.08">everybody has so long to say their part</text>
  <text start="261.39" dur="4.02">the other team gets to rebut this is how</text>
  <text start="263.91" dur="5.52">debate works</text>
  <text start="265.41" dur="6.66">I would really encourage Isaac and uni</text>
  <text start="269.43" dur="4.38">Rock to prepare because I am going to</text>
  <text start="272.07" dur="4.26">prepare and I&amp;#39;m not gonna do this</text>
  <text start="273.81" dur="5.13">without my note I&amp;#39;m gonna be competent</text>
  <text start="276.33" dur="5.55">at this debate I&amp;#39;m going to hopefully</text>
  <text start="278.94" dur="6.18">demolish and I hope that these guys will</text>
  <text start="281.88" dur="5.58">will prepare themselves accordingly</text>
  <text start="285.12" dur="4.23">because if you&amp;#39;re coming against me in a</text>
  <text start="287.46" dur="3">debate and you haven&amp;#39;t even prepared and</text>
  <text start="289.35" dur="2.88">you&amp;#39;re just basically like throwing up a</text>
  <text start="290.46" dur="5.34">channeling you&amp;#39;re like let&amp;#39;s go it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="292.23" dur="5.79">gonna go well however I&amp;#39;m also not gonna</text>
  <text start="295.8" dur="3.6">just do it I&amp;#39;m not I don&amp;#39;t debate like</text>
  <text start="298.02" dur="3.99">that you know I debate with information</text>
  <text start="299.4" dur="3.6">facts data and and frankly with queueing</text>
  <text start="302.01" dur="2.97">on there&amp;#39;s way more than I can remember</text>
  <text start="303" dur="3.36">there&amp;#39;s like a hundred plus points of</text>
  <text start="304.98" dur="3.09">evidence guys it&amp;#39;s gonna take me at</text>
  <text start="306.36" dur="4.23">least a week and a half to gather my</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="5.01">notes in addition to my fourth of July</text>

  <text start="319.5" dur="5.61">get that scheduled assuming that no one</text>
  <text start="321.69" dur="5.4">backs out I don&amp;#39;t think anyone will that</text>
  <text start="325.11" dur="6.45">is not among their character flaws right</text>

  <text start="340.59" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s a lot of challenge of ideas in</text>
  <text start="342.72" dur="3.449">the air and this kind of helps to settle</text>
  <text start="344.31" dur="3.75">some of that down so I think that that</text>
