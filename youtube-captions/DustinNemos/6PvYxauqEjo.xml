  <text start="11.219" dur="5.521">based on quality and so we&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="13.799" dur="5.4">that same notion and approach to YouTube</text>
  <text start="16.74" dur="6.42">so that we can rank higher quality stuff</text>
  <text start="19.199" dur="5.611">better and really prevent borderline</text>
  <text start="23.16" dur="3.33">content content which doesn&amp;#39;t exactly</text>
  <text start="24.81" dur="3.75">violate policies which need to be</text>
  <text start="26.49" dur="5.43">removed thing we are trying to do is to</text>
  <text start="28.56" dur="5.64">bring more authoritative sources and</text>
  <text start="31.92" dur="4.08">fact checks on videos which may be</text>
  <text start="34.2" dur="3.39">controversial it&amp;#39;s a case where we got</text>
  <text start="36" dur="3.079">it wrong but that&amp;#39;s what we are trying</text>
  <text start="37.59" dur="5.399">to do and we are working hard to improve</text>

  <text start="67.14" dur="4.68">evolve them because we see changes and</text>
  <text start="69.36" dur="4.38">how the platform is getting used just</text>
  <text start="71.82" dur="5.159">last week we had significant revisions</text>
  <text start="73.74" dur="5.97">to our hate speech policy at YouTube we</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="4.951">are very focused on removing harmful</text>
  <text start="79.71" dur="4.62">content and reducing the spread of what</text>
  <text start="81.93" dur="3.93">we think of us bought bind content just</text>
  <text start="84.33" dur="3.929">last quarter we removed over nine</text>
  <text start="85.86" dur="4.68">million videos and and so it&amp;#39;s an</text>

  <text start="160.03" dur="4.5">yeah just to basically sum it up for</text>
  <text start="162.64" dur="3.42">people it&amp;#39;s digital book burning for</text>
  <text start="164.53" dur="3.27">being erased from the internet for</text>
  <text start="166.06" dur="4.38">supporting the President Trump or for</text>
  <text start="167.8" dur="5.37">having a dissident view to fake news and</text>
  <text start="170.44" dur="4.65">big tank yeah thank you for explaining</text>
  <text start="173.17" dur="4.71">it because that was what I wanted to</text>
  <text start="175.09" dur="5.58">start with explaining to the audience</text>
  <text start="177.88" dur="5.7">what stop bit birding is and what it</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="5.03">means the reason I&amp;#39;m having you out here</text>
  <text start="183.58" dur="4.29">is because we&amp;#39;ve been having some great</text>
  <text start="185.7" dur="5.98">dialogues with a lot of different</text>
  <text start="187.87" dur="6.69">creators across the spectrum and the one</text>
  <text start="191.68" dur="6.35">common thing that we all share is this</text>
  <text start="194.56" dur="6.48">experience with big tech where we are</text>
  <text start="198.03" dur="6.1">under attack for a lack of a better term</text>
  <text start="201.04" dur="5.28">we are constantly under attack for</text>
  <text start="204.13" dur="5.25">trying to get our message out there and</text>
  <text start="206.32" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s one of those things that makes you</text>
  <text start="209.38" dur="4.859">really stop and think and once you start</text>
  <text start="211.81" dur="3.959">looking at the facts that&amp;#39;s when it gets</text>
  <text start="214.239" dur="3.931">even more disturbing and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="215.769" dur="4.081">stopped it burning has been able to do</text>
  <text start="218.17" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s been able to bring together</text>
  <text start="219.85" dur="5.19">legal experts with content creators with</text>
  <text start="222.82" dur="5.1">you know social media other social media</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="6">influencers with just other people in</text>
  <text start="227.92" dur="5.33">general that are out there who are</text>
  <text start="231.04" dur="5.19">experiencing this kind of tech</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="6.97">technocratic fascistic censorship on a</text>
  <text start="236.23" dur="7.39">regular basis and they really have no</text>
  <text start="240.22" dur="4.99">you know recourse except to kind of come</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="4.2">together and start fleshing out these</text>
  <text start="245.21" dur="4.53">ideas of you know how do we fight this</text>
  <text start="247.82" dur="3.75">how do we address what the problem is</text>
  <text start="249.74" dur="5.1">and then how do we move forward so I</text>
  <text start="251.57" dur="6.24">want to start by asking you what you can</text>
  <text start="254.84" dur="4.679">tell us about stop bit burning what you</text>
  <text start="257.81" dur="4.98">can tell us about the movement who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.519" dur="4.681">involved so far and you know kind of</text>
  <text start="262.79" dur="2.73">let&amp;#39;s start there because this is gonna</text>
  <text start="264.2" dur="4.26">kind of lay the groundwork for what</text>
  <text start="265.52" dur="3.39">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about here sure thank</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="3.36">you Frank</text>
  <text start="268.91" dur="5.13">um so obviously if bit burning itself as</text>
  <text start="271.82" dur="5.88">digital censorship stop that burning is</text>
  <text start="274.04" dur="5.46">a campaign to bring together a coalition</text>
  <text start="277.7" dur="3.93">of people who for the most part</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="3.51">themselves have suffered censorship or</text>
  <text start="281.63" dur="4.2">you know even if they just care about</text>
  <text start="283.01" dur="5.22">free speech come together because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="285.83" dur="4.56">stronger together and individually we</text>
  <text start="288.23" dur="5.22">are sort of being slowed boiled like a</text>
  <text start="290.39" dur="5.58">frog and we&amp;#39;re sort of losing reach</text>
  <text start="293.45" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;re losing certainly income being</text>
  <text start="295.97" dur="6.75">demonetized we&amp;#39;re being drained out</text>
  <text start="298.91" dur="5.7">fleshed out driven out and just erased</text>
  <text start="302.72" dur="4.89">from the internet so by coming together</text>
  <text start="304.61" dur="5.1">we can actually possibly even back</text>
  <text start="307.61" dur="5.13">illegal action back in campaign raise</text>
  <text start="309.71" dur="5.1">awareness and and that&amp;#39;s kind of the</text>
  <text start="312.74" dur="3.27">goal so far I don&amp;#39;t want to say who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.81" dur="4.5">involved just yet because they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="316.01" dur="5.94">told me I can but a number of people are</text>
  <text start="319.31" dur="4.89">very interested the first meeting we had</text>
  <text start="321.95" dur="5.88">roughly a month ago I don&amp;#39;t remember the</text>
  <text start="324.2" dur="6.12">exact date now but they had about a</text>
  <text start="327.83" dur="6.06">dozen or about 1314 people showed up</text>
  <text start="330.32" dur="4.92">this time it was around 30 or more so it</text>
  <text start="333.89" dur="3.42">was just a short time and we&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="335.24" dur="3.84">tripled the momentum is clearly there I</text>
  <text start="337.31" dur="2.94">mean everyone&amp;#39;s mad about it we have</text>
  <text start="339.08" dur="3.27">President Trump tweeting about</text>
  <text start="340.25" dur="3.6">censorship we have Congress people</text>
  <text start="342.35" dur="3.569">asking them questions about it and then</text>
  <text start="343.85" dur="4.14">we have Zuckerberg and others lying</text>
  <text start="345.919" dur="4.711">about it so you know it&amp;#39;s clearly an</text>
  <text start="347.99" dur="4.35">issue whose time has come and I feel</text>
  <text start="350.63" dur="4.44">like there&amp;#39;s some there&amp;#39;s some definite</text>
  <text start="352.34" dur="4.29">power and unity here you know I know</text>
  <text start="355.07" dur="3.18">you&amp;#39;ve been censored I&amp;#39;ve been censored</text>
  <text start="356.63" dur="5.22">you were recently demonetized</text>
  <text start="358.25" dur="5.04">you know welcome to the club and you</text>
  <text start="361.85" dur="3.78">know to say that on behalf of all of us</text>
  <text start="363.29" dur="5.61">because a while back they got most of us</text>
  <text start="365.63" dur="6.339">with the Vox ad pocalypse so you know</text>
  <text start="368.9" dur="4.839">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s it is a big club now</text>
  <text start="371.969" dur="3.391">and you know that&amp;#39;s kind of the goal</text>
  <text start="373.739" dur="4.02">with bit burning is just to bring us all</text>
  <text start="375.36" dur="3.539">together see what we can do if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.759" dur="3.09">millions of us</text>
  <text start="378.899" dur="4.49">sorry millions of us backing it then we</text>
  <text start="380.849" dur="5.661">can even possibly do a class-action</text>
  <text start="383.389" dur="5.191">antitrust lawsuit</text>
  <text start="386.51" dur="5.22">yeah I think it&amp;#39;s interesting because</text>
  <text start="388.58" dur="6.15">you know everything you you highlighted</text>
  <text start="391.73" dur="5.04">there&amp;#39;s is really important about what</text>
  <text start="394.73" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re going up against and I know that</text>
  <text start="396.77" dur="4.23">the the meaning the group itself grew</text>
  <text start="399.56" dur="3.39">exponentially I mean like you said we</text>
  <text start="401" dur="5.07">started off with like like the first</text>
  <text start="402.95" dur="4.86">call like you said 1215 people and now</text>
  <text start="406.07" dur="3.84">what we have 30-plus or something like</text>
  <text start="407.81" dur="3.21">that and ladies and gentlemen me just</text>
  <text start="409.91" dur="5.04">say even then we&amp;#39;re not naming names</text>
  <text start="411.02" dur="6.66">here the people involved on the backend</text>
  <text start="414.95" dur="6.06">are some of the biggest youtubers out</text>
  <text start="417.68" dur="5.16">there social media people out there from</text>
  <text start="421.01" dur="4.29">all the different social media platforms</text>
  <text start="422.84" dur="4.02">and I can I can tell you that because</text>
  <text start="425.3" dur="3">I&amp;#39;ve been in these calls and I know</text>
  <text start="426.86" dur="3.48">who&amp;#39;s there</text>
  <text start="428.3" dur="4.89">so that and of itself is really</text>
  <text start="430.34" dur="5.07">important to remember and then like you</text>
  <text start="433.19" dur="6.06">said about figuring out this whole class</text>
  <text start="435.41" dur="5.46">action idea or even just what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="439.25" dur="2.82">gotten from these phone calls which I</text>
  <text start="440.87" dur="4.59">think&amp;#39;s really important is</text>
  <text start="442.07" dur="6.42">understanding legally what kind of</text>
  <text start="445.46" dur="5.34">recourse there is for us just in general</text>
  <text start="448.49" dur="4.38">whether it is in class action or whether</text>
  <text start="450.8" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s just in a form in the form of</text>
  <text start="452.87" dur="4.59">understanding you know how they are</text>
  <text start="454.94" dur="4.47">manipulating the system how the the big</text>
  <text start="457.46" dur="5.19">tech companies are breaking the law when</text>
  <text start="459.41" dur="5.79">they do these these practices which</text>
  <text start="462.65" dur="5.4">undermine and undercut our ability to</text>
  <text start="465.2" dur="5.76">grow undercut our ability to earn a</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="6.18">living and then also you know go to help</text>
  <text start="470.96" dur="5.7">the fake news you know media complex as</text>
  <text start="474.23" dur="6.35">a whole and then how it&amp;#39;s all this kind</text>
  <text start="476.66" dur="8.34">of cycle that we&amp;#39;re in right now and I</text>
  <text start="480.58" dur="5.53">really think that we&amp;#39;re in the middle of</text>
  <text start="485" dur="4.29">something that&amp;#39;s going to be really</text>
  <text start="486.11" dur="5.63">important in the midst of a collection</text>
  <text start="489.29" dur="5.88">of individuals are gonna come together</text>
  <text start="491.74" dur="5.68">you know to really solve this problem by</text>
  <text start="495.17" dur="4.38">examining it and then taking it on</text>
  <text start="497.42" dur="6.36">headfirst what are your thoughts on</text>
  <text start="499.55" dur="5.67">where this goes from here well Craig</text>
  <text start="503.78" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;ve always been a champion of free</text>
  <text start="505.22" dur="4.65">speech and I like that about you I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="507.71" dur="4.68">hoping that by bringing all these guys</text>
  <text start="509.87" dur="4.2">together and and sort of at least</text>
  <text start="512.39" dur="4.11">raising awareness and bringing this to</text>
  <text start="514.07" dur="3.899">the national level of being censored</text>
  <text start="516.5" dur="3.979">right before obviously this is just</text>
  <text start="517.969" dur="5.031">another form of totality</text>
  <text start="520.479" dur="4.381">from the left and it&amp;#39;s a form of you</text>
  <text start="523" dur="4.019">know trying to impeach president Trump</text>
  <text start="524.86" dur="3.93">and you&amp;#39;re fair in the 2020 election</text>
  <text start="527.019" dur="4.021">because they&amp;#39;re trying to stop the</text>
  <text start="528.79" dur="5.4">competition for the for the dying fake</text>
  <text start="531.04" dur="4.56">news and you know we&amp;#39;re winning leaps</text>
  <text start="534.19" dur="2.82">and bounds were growing without</text>
  <text start="535.6" dur="3.9">shrinking they&amp;#39;re having mass layoffs</text>
  <text start="537.01" dur="4.86">but the problem is the way the law is</text>
  <text start="539.5" dur="4.41">set up it&amp;#39;s really rigged in their favor</text>
  <text start="541.87" dur="5.149">it really protects them on a lot of</text>
  <text start="543.91" dur="6.66">levels but there is kind of a no and</text>
  <text start="547.019" dur="5.111">that would be that you know from the</text>
  <text start="550.57" dur="3.3">free-speech angle it&amp;#39;s hard to attack</text>
  <text start="552.13" dur="3.389">but from the business angle it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="553.87" dur="3.93">more open and what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="555.519" dur="3.721">clearly also a business attack on our</text>
  <text start="557.8" dur="3.029">you know as you said it&amp;#39;s attack on our</text>
  <text start="559.24" dur="3.959">businesses it&amp;#39;s an attack on our</text>
  <text start="560.829" dur="4.5">livelihoods so from a business angle</text>
  <text start="563.199" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re trying to drown us out that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="565.329" dur="4.26">also illegal</text>
  <text start="566.769" dur="4.801">so this is a big attack angle for us</text>
  <text start="569.589" dur="3.69">through a class-action antitrust which</text>
  <text start="571.57" dur="4.53">you know I commissioned with Todd</text>
  <text start="573.279" dur="6.211">McMurtry who&amp;#39;s one of the super lawyers</text>
  <text start="576.1" dur="4.77">behind defending some of the salmon are</text>
  <text start="579.49" dur="3.69">some of the covington students and</text>
  <text start="580.87" dur="4.44">Bigelow salmon against the big news</text>
  <text start="583.18" dur="3.99">media you know the fake news Giants that</text>
  <text start="585.31" dur="4.649">came against him and smeared the kids</text>
  <text start="587.17" dur="4.409">and it was a big debacle and he was one</text>
  <text start="589.959" dur="4.771">of the champion lawyers that stood up to</text>
  <text start="591.579" dur="6.331">to sort of stand against Goliath in that</text>
  <text start="594.73" dur="5.43">situation so he&amp;#39;s the first guy I went</text>
  <text start="597.91" dur="3.989">to to talk to about this idea and I</text>
  <text start="600.16" dur="3.84">commissioned through him some research</text>
  <text start="601.899" dur="4.021">and you know is very expensive but you</text>
  <text start="604" dur="4.41">know he and his team were able to pull</text>
  <text start="605.92" dur="4.8">together kind of a couple different</text>

  <text start="676.14" dur="3.93">has always looked at like you said in a</text>
  <text start="677.399" dur="4.411">free speech in a sense I think the key</text>
  <text start="680.07" dur="3.6">point that we&amp;#39;re starting to realize as</text>
  <text start="681.81" dur="4.35">we come together and have more of these</text>
  <text start="683.67" dur="4.53">conversations is that it is the business</text>
  <text start="686.16" dur="4.5">side and that the business side may be</text>
  <text start="688.2" dur="4.17">where they are the most vulnerable it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="690.66" dur="2.76">where they think that they&amp;#39;re the the</text>
  <text start="692.37" dur="2.37">least vulnerable</text>
  <text start="693.42" dur="4.409">it really is where they are the most</text>
  <text start="694.74" dur="4.17">vulnerable because like we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="697.829" dur="3.51">about I&amp;#39;m not going to get into the</text>
  <text start="698.91" dur="4.41">details of you know the CDA in different</text>
  <text start="701.339" dur="3.631">sections because that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s getting a</text>
  <text start="703.32" dur="4.68">little too deep and the legalese of it</text>
  <text start="704.97" dur="5.429">but there&amp;#39;s an argument to be made that</text>
  <text start="708" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;re all kind of coming together and</text>
  <text start="710.399" dur="6.38">seeing that when YouTube for example</text>
  <text start="713.07" dur="7.56">takes a video such as yours Truly&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="716.779" dur="5.471">you know takes away all of my suggested</text>
  <text start="720.63" dur="5.64">videos that&amp;#39;s fine right</text>
  <text start="722.25" dur="6.87">but then if I&amp;#39;m doing an editorial on</text>
  <text start="726.27" dur="5.1">the news right and you&amp;#39;re replacing all</text>
  <text start="729.12" dur="4.709">of my content out of your suggestive</text>
  <text start="731.37" dur="5.459">video with somebody who basically you</text>
  <text start="733.829" dur="5.191">could say is a competitor of mine such</text>
  <text start="736.829" dur="6.271">as Fox News and you&amp;#39;re showing that</text>
  <text start="739.02" dur="5.939">favor to them then and at the same time</text>
  <text start="743.1" dur="4.92">denying me the access to things like</text>
  <text start="744.959" dur="4.891">monetization and like you said suggested</text>
  <text start="748.02" dur="3.78">videos there&amp;#39;s an argument to be made</text>
  <text start="749.85" dur="4.04">that they&amp;#39;re engaging in what would be</text>
  <text start="751.8" dur="5.46">called tortious interference against my</text>
  <text start="753.89" dur="5.41">individual right to have a contract with</text>
  <text start="757.26" dur="6.09">a third party being that advertiser and</text>
  <text start="759.3" dur="6.27">the audience right so your timing option</text>
  <text start="763.35" dur="4.53">as well yeah and diving deeper into all</text>
  <text start="765.57" dur="4.94">of these different avenues I think is</text>
  <text start="767.88" dur="7.17">the most important part of understanding</text>
  <text start="770.51" dur="6.01">you know where this can go as far as you</text>
  <text start="775.05" dur="2.729">know we&amp;#39;re fighting for free speech but</text>
  <text start="776.52" dur="3.369">we&amp;#39;re also fighting for the right to</text>
  <text start="777.779" dur="4.09">compete in a fair</text>
  <text start="779.889" dur="4.95">market you know to not have the the</text>
  <text start="781.869" dur="4.68">system gamed against us and the the the</text>
  <text start="784.839" dur="5.881">decks rigged by the time we get to the</text>
  <text start="786.549" dur="6.871">table and that&amp;#39;s what we see now for</text>
  <text start="790.72" dur="5.099">instance today if somebody tried to</text>
  <text start="793.42" dur="4.56">start a channel doing kind of similar</text>
  <text start="795.819" dur="3.721">content to what I&amp;#39;m doing I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="797.98" dur="4.169">they would stand a chance and you know</text>
  <text start="799.54" dur="4.5">what and that is what we have to fix I</text>
  <text start="802.149" dur="3.9">think is that they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re slowly</text>
  <text start="804.04" dur="4.229">like you said where the the frog in</text>
  <text start="806.049" dur="3.75">boiling water they&amp;#39;re turning up the</text>
  <text start="808.269" dur="3.6">heat and they&amp;#39;re slowly trying to</text>
  <text start="809.799" dur="5.09">basically get rid of us so they can</text>
  <text start="811.869" dur="7.171">replace us with the corporate approved</text>
  <text start="814.889" dur="7.3">you know next or fake dues or whatever</text>
  <text start="819.04" dur="4.649">it is right and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="822.189" dur="3.781">think the big problems but what do you</text>
  <text start="823.689" dur="4.5">think yeah I mean they&amp;#39;re clearly</text>
  <text start="825.97" dur="4.049">setting the the rules against us they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="828.189" dur="5.4">creating an unfair and rigged</text>
  <text start="830.019" dur="4.98">marketplace and it has to stop I mean I</text>
  <text start="833.589" dur="3.511">think the energy is there people are</text>
  <text start="834.999" dur="4.2">ready for it we just needed a way we</text>
  <text start="837.1" dur="4.469">could have stood against Google and</text>
  <text start="839.199" dur="4.38">YouTube or any of these big giants alone</text>
  <text start="841.569" dur="3.33">but you know they can&amp;#39;t stop all of us</text>
  <text start="843.579" dur="3.42">they certainly can&amp;#39;t stop all of us</text>
  <text start="844.899" dur="3.99">together and that&amp;#39;s kind of the goal now</text>
  <text start="846.999" dur="3.99">I think people see a way forward they</text>
  <text start="848.889" dur="3.87">see a path now they see something that</text>
  <text start="850.989" dur="4.83">we can actually do that that could make</text>
  <text start="852.759" dur="5.211">a difference and possibly even set a</text>
  <text start="855.819" dur="4.08">precedent or change the game and</text>
  <text start="857.97" dur="4.059">certainly we could we could bring</text>
  <text start="859.899" dur="5.27">attention to this issue and it burning</text>
  <text start="862.029" dur="5.73">is a new word for us to do just that</text>
  <text start="865.169" dur="4.72">it&amp;#39;s a new word to define and grant</text>
  <text start="867.759" dur="4.8">Wayne explain bit burning in the sense</text>
  <text start="869.889" dur="4.44">of I mean obviously it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s modern</text>
  <text start="872.559" dur="4.171">book burning is that that what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="874.329" dur="4.32">getting out there it is yeah bits are</text>
  <text start="876.73" dur="4.529">just you know digital information like a</text>
  <text start="878.649" dur="4.68">bite you know and bit burning is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="881.259" dur="4.5">happening when they instead of burning a</text>
  <text start="883.329" dur="4.021">book for example they burn our digital</text>
  <text start="885.759" dur="3.42">videos off the internet where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="887.35" dur="4.529">trying to spread the news so it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="889.179" dur="4.35">book burning in a new era and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="891.879" dur="3.54">clearly the same thing is what happens</text>
  <text start="893.529" dur="3.84">when totalitarians don&amp;#39;t like what</text>
  <text start="895.419" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re leaving or thinking or saying or</text>
  <text start="897.369" dur="4.14">writing and they want to get rid of what</text>
  <text start="899.319" dur="4.35">you think because you have wrong thing</text>
  <text start="901.509" dur="5.07">whether it may you know whether it be</text>
  <text start="903.669" dur="5.73">you&amp;#39;re pro-life views or you know your</text>
  <text start="906.579" dur="4.62">backwater hick you know religion as they</text>
  <text start="909.399" dur="3.74">would see it you know just spreading the</text>
  <text start="911.199" dur="3.711">word of God or anything like that</text>
  <text start="913.139" dur="2.94">just want to burn you off the internet</text>
  <text start="914.91" dur="3.69">because they don&amp;#39;t want to have to</text>
  <text start="916.079" dur="4.92">compete with your message so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="918.6" dur="5.489">not good enough then that&amp;#39;s their view</text>
  <text start="920.999" dur="6.3">so it basically sets the tone for what</text>
  <text start="924.089" dur="5.79">big tech wants it to be and there there</text>
  <text start="927.299" dur="5.19">are no other opinions alone yeah I mean</text>
  <text start="929.879" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s competing for like you said they</text>
  <text start="932.489" dur="5.551">don&amp;#39;t want to compete against us in the</text>
  <text start="934.739" dur="5.31">open market and because they know in the</text>
  <text start="938.04" dur="4.949">open market we win right when</text>
  <text start="940.049" dur="6.15">everything&amp;#39;s set to even we win and</text>
  <text start="942.989" dur="6.421">that&amp;#39;s the biggest you know problem I</text>
  <text start="946.199" dur="5.25">see with it is that you know it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="949.41" dur="3.57">same things that we cover here on the</text>
  <text start="951.449" dur="4.08">channel that I talked about over on just</text>
  <text start="952.98" dur="4.74">talk all the time you know is that you</text>
  <text start="955.529" dur="5.64">have people who are in positions of</text>
  <text start="957.72" dur="5.519">power who use their power in order to</text>
  <text start="961.169" dur="4.41">silence others to silence dissent to</text>
  <text start="963.239" dur="6.18">silence conversation debate you name it</text>
  <text start="965.579" dur="5.55">just that simply asking questions and we</text>
  <text start="969.419" dur="3.991">have to continue to be loud about this</text>
  <text start="971.129" dur="4.95">we have to organize we have to come</text>
  <text start="973.41" dur="5.099">together and and really show them that</text>
  <text start="976.079" dur="4.44">they can&amp;#39;t do this to us they can&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="978.509" dur="4.38">shut us down throw us in the memory hole</text>
  <text start="980.519" dur="4.41">never to be heard again and I think</text>
  <text start="982.889" dur="5.1">that&amp;#39;s why I really am drawn to the</text>
  <text start="984.929" dur="5.01">movement that you founded and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="987.989" dur="4.71">talking about this thing for a long time</text>
  <text start="989.939" dur="6.11">and the more people get involved the</text>
  <text start="992.699" dur="5.7">more it seems that if anything</text>
  <text start="996.049" dur="6.07">regardless of what happens legally or</text>
  <text start="998.399" dur="7.05">not if we get enough people involved in</text>
  <text start="1002.119" dur="5.91">this idea of changing the system and the</text>
  <text start="1005.449" dur="5.06">way it is that&amp;#39;s how we change society</text>
  <text start="1008.029" dur="5.4">that&amp;#39;s how we get rid of these these</text>
  <text start="1010.509" dur="5.17">unaccountable unelected fascists in</text>
  <text start="1013.429" dur="4.65">Silicon Valley who are telling me and</text>
  <text start="1015.679" dur="4.681">you what to say what we can do and then</text>
  <text start="1018.079" dur="4.92">if we don&amp;#39;t tow the line they take away</text>
  <text start="1020.36" dur="4.469">your social media accounts they take</text>
  <text start="1022.999" dur="4.29">away your bank account and then they</text>
  <text start="1024.829" dur="4.95">take away your right to you know call an</text>
  <text start="1027.289" dur="4.831">uber I mean it what point does it stop</text>
  <text start="1029.779" dur="3.81">till you&amp;#39;re just sitting in a field in</text>
  <text start="1032.12" dur="2.85">the middle of nowhere you know with a</text>
  <text start="1033.589" dur="3.33">fire like a caveman</text>
  <text start="1034.97" dur="3.809">you know stoking it going I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1036.919" dur="2.88">what happened I was I was so good you</text>
  <text start="1038.779" dur="4.56">know I thought I was doing all right</text>
  <text start="1039.799" dur="5.25">yeah I hear you and I can I can</text>
  <text start="1043.339" dur="2.87">visualize exactly what you&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1045.049" dur="2.421">here because that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="1046.209" dur="3.661">what they would like to see us happen</text>
  <text start="1047.47" dur="4.199">they want us criminalized for thinking</text>
  <text start="1049.87" dur="3.51">but they can&amp;#39;t so they have to do</text>
  <text start="1051.669" dur="3.661">everything that they can to punish us</text>
  <text start="1053.38" dur="3.99">and you know what I don&amp;#39;t want to say</text>
  <text start="1055.33" dur="3.719">any names but at that meeting that and</text>
  <text start="1057.37" dur="3.48">the last one if we total that up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1059.049" dur="4.051">around five million people that we could</text>
  <text start="1060.85" dur="4.11">reach so we&amp;#39;re already there we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1063.1" dur="3.299">already too big to stop it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="1064.96" dur="3">matter now of sort of getting the</text>
  <text start="1066.399" dur="3.63">awareness up and getting people to know</text>
  <text start="1067.96" dur="4.8">kind of what that burning really is</text>
  <text start="1070.029" dur="4.321">about and in campaigning on that and</text>
  <text start="1072.76" dur="4.11">letting people know and then we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1074.35" dur="7.049">win first they try to silence you and</text>
  <text start="1076.87" dur="7.9">then they attack you and then UN I mean</text>
  <text start="1081.399" dur="5.471">and at the end of the day you know</text>
  <text start="1084.77" dur="4.289">every time they take a little bit a</text>
  <text start="1086.87" dur="4.65">little piece away it is death by a</text>
  <text start="1089.059" dur="4.711">thousand cuts and the the sooner that</text>
  <text start="1091.52" dur="4.31">people get that the sooner people honor</text>
  <text start="1093.77" dur="5.7">the sooner that people understand that</text>
  <text start="1095.83" dur="6.04">what they&amp;#39;re doing is organized and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1099.47" dur="4.83">methodical and it&amp;#39;s been it&amp;#39;s been well</text>
  <text start="1101.87" dur="4.68">planned in advance I mean the Google</text>

  <text start="1213.89" dur="3.3">the end of the day there&amp;#39;s also two</text>
  <text start="1215.929" dur="2.561">other options there&amp;#39;s one for</text>
  <text start="1217.19" dur="3.13">influencers who</text>
  <text start="1218.49" dur="4.35">our folks like uh social media guys</text>

  <text start="1226.95" dur="5.61">the conversation as you said they can</text>
  <text start="1229.44" dur="4.68">join as influencers and that&amp;#39;s a short</text>
  <text start="1232.56" dur="3.81">form they fill out and then they get</text>
  <text start="1234.12" dur="4.89">plugged into our emails and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1236.37" dur="4.35">contact them and reach out and then</text>
  <text start="1239.01" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s a third option as a sponsor just</text>
  <text start="1240.72" dur="4.53">someone who wants to maybe contribute to</text>
  <text start="1242.73" dur="4.61">the expenses that are you know already</text>
  <text start="1245.25" dur="4.92">in the five figures as far as legal</text>
  <text start="1247.34" dur="5.74">research that got us to this point</text>
  <text start="1250.17" dur="4.26">and then soon hopefully if things go</text>
