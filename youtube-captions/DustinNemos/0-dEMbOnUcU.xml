  <text start="21.09" dur="5.73">down I kind of expected this to be more</text>
  <text start="23.49" dur="5.369">about obviously what you&amp;#39;re doing you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="26.82" dur="3.33">you&amp;#39;re innovating and in a very unique</text>
  <text start="28.859" dur="3.181">way with what you&amp;#39;re doing with the</text>
  <text start="30.15" dur="3.27">urban farming in the backyards and</text>
  <text start="32.04" dur="3.09">teaching people to make money and</text>
  <text start="33.42" dur="3.479">everything else but I had read before</text>
  <text start="35.13" dur="5.01">you would make some comments that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="36.899" dur="5.371">also you know an anarchist like are you</text>
  <text start="40.14" dur="3.78">a - you know I don&amp;#39;t know specifically</text>

  <text start="51.69" dur="3.24">honest I don&amp;#39;t know too much the</text>
  <text start="53.07" dur="3.57">difference between a voluntarist and a</text>
  <text start="54.93" dur="4.05">anarchist to me it just seems like</text>
  <text start="56.64" dur="5.16">cement semantics</text>
  <text start="58.98" dur="5.49">I guess philosophically I&amp;#39;m an anarchist</text>
  <text start="61.8" dur="6.9">practically on the libertarian okay okay</text>
  <text start="64.47" dur="6.45">like I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m with you know I&amp;#39;m with</text>
  <text start="68.7" dur="3.63">a lot of the anarchist thinkers in the</text>
  <text start="70.92" dur="3.66">sense that you know the state is</text>
  <text start="72.33" dur="4.8">coercion and like we should do</text>
  <text start="74.58" dur="5.88">everything to not violate people and</text>
  <text start="77.13" dur="4.86">coerce people however we&amp;#39;re let me live</text>
  <text start="80.46" dur="4.56">in a world where live in a world where</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="5.25">most people aren&amp;#39;t ready to hear that</text>
  <text start="85.02" dur="4.83">and and most people would not get behind</text>
  <text start="87.24" dur="6.239">anybody who wanted to do that because</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re cattle like we&amp;#39;re where</text>
  <text start="93.479" dur="4.021">she yeah pretty I mean we&amp;#39;re farmed you</text>
  <text start="96" dur="3.689">know and so people aren&amp;#39;t ready to leave</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="4.979">the the cage or the animal farm you know</text>
  <text start="99.689" dur="4.261">as Orwell put it so I think I think I</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="5.491">got a practical sense I&amp;#39;m a libertarian</text>
  <text start="103.95" dur="6.029">and and I yeah yeah your it sounds like</text>
  <text start="107.97" dur="4.38">you you would probably fit with the</text>
  <text start="109.979" dur="3.661">voluntary basis that all human</text>
  <text start="112.35" dur="4.019">interaction should be voluntary no</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="4.079">coercion exactly and I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="4.381">so different about that than a Newark</text>
  <text start="117.719" dur="6.18">ISM well it was the it was the name you</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="5.1">know how like yeah I you have taken the</text>
  <text start="123.899" dur="4.351">name and yes and they&amp;#39;ve done it with so</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="3.659">many other words but now Anarchy the</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="4.02">first thing that comes to mind are these</text>
  <text start="129.509" dur="4.021">black-clad anti fights they&amp;#39;re anti</text>
  <text start="132.27" dur="4.17">yeah these</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="4.83">idiots yeah yeah totally so voluntary</text>
  <text start="136.44" dur="5.43">ISM is another it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a synergist</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="6.51">with or must the word it means the same</text>
  <text start="141.87" dur="5.61">thing as anarcho-capitalists but yeah</text>
  <text start="144.87" dur="5.94">and I I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m full on there like I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="161.88" dur="7.2">gonna be good friends so yeah I mean I</text>
  <text start="167.13" dur="4.29">would love to talk just briefly about</text>
  <text start="169.08" dur="3.99">that as far as like what it can offer to</text>
  <text start="171.42" dur="2.85">people how difficult it is to get into</text>
  <text start="173.07" dur="3.3">the urban farming and stuff I mean</text>
  <text start="174.27" dur="3.78">obviously we can talk about the state we</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="3.089">can talk about you know you said you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="178.05" dur="3.57">aware of queueing on and you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="179.459" dur="4.261">down some rabbit up big-time</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="3.54">yeah that&amp;#39;s really I mean why would you</text>
  <text start="183.72" dur="2.76">like to go with it first well you know</text>
  <text start="185.16" dur="5.01">what one thing I&amp;#39;d like to start with</text>
  <text start="186.48" dur="5.85">saying is um you know a big a big thing</text>
  <text start="190.17" dur="3.69">for me I I found</text>
  <text start="192.33" dur="3.51">let me go back a little bit I sometimes</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="6.71">have a tendency to like keep splintering</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="9.09">off my 32 material list for my list yeah</text>
  <text start="200.57" dur="8.889">you know I I have found different</text>
  <text start="204.93" dur="5.58">reasons to justify what I do over the</text>
  <text start="209.459" dur="3.631">years like I&amp;#39;ve been doing this almost</text>
  <text start="210.51" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;ve been doing this this is what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="213.09" dur="4.47">9 this is my ninth year of doing this</text>
  <text start="214.95" dur="5.73">and when I first got into this dude I</text>
  <text start="217.56" dur="4.649">was totally I wouldn&amp;#39;t say a social I</text>
  <text start="220.68" dur="3.21">wouldn&amp;#39;t I would definitely wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="222.209" dur="6.271">social justice where I&amp;#39;ve always hated</text>
  <text start="223.89" dur="6.33">political correctness but I was very and</text>
  <text start="228.48" dur="6.12">I still consider myself liberal liberal</text>
  <text start="230.22" dur="6.18">but but I was very lefty and when I</text>
  <text start="234.6" dur="4.26">first got into this I was like</text>
  <text start="236.4" dur="4.83">anti-capitalist and stuff and I think I</text>
  <text start="238.86" dur="5.719">have found like but I&amp;#39;ve always been a</text>
  <text start="241.23" dur="5.759">person that has this sought the truth</text>
  <text start="244.579" dur="4.66">and at any cost</text>
  <text start="246.989" dur="4.861">I&amp;#39;m willing to confront the truth even</text>
  <text start="249.239" dur="4.021">if it you know causes me major levels of</text>
  <text start="251.85" dur="3.84">cognitive dissonance which I think I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="4.83">lived with for most of my life but so</text>
  <text start="255.69" dur="4.68">the reason I&amp;#39;m doing this now I think on</text>
  <text start="258.09" dur="3.69">a personal level is different than what</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="3.09">it was when I first started like when</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="3.6">when I first started it was like yeah</text>
  <text start="263.46" dur="4.16">screw the system kind of thing and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="265.38" dur="5.7">I&amp;#39;m still I still kind of have that</text>
  <text start="267.62" dur="5.38">but for me it&amp;#39;s about empowering other</text>
  <text start="271.08" dur="3.66">individuals to take control of their</text>
  <text start="273" dur="3.96">lives take control the food they eat</text>
  <text start="274.74" dur="4.89">potentially make a living from it and</text>
  <text start="276.96" dur="5.9">and and and create I want to create</text>
  <text start="279.63" dur="8.76">strong individuals I want to help people</text>
  <text start="282.86" dur="7.06">become anti fragile individuals and I</text>
  <text start="288.39" dur="2.85">use that term anti fragile over</text>
  <text start="289.92" dur="4.38">resilience because I think it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="291.24" dur="5.25">important and and I and I and I&amp;#39;m that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.3" dur="3.93">what motivates me to do this now it</text>
  <text start="296.49" dur="3.36">wasn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s not where I was before I</text>
  <text start="298.23" dur="4.38">used to really buy the climate change</text>
  <text start="299.85" dur="5.36">you know I don&amp;#39;t really anymore I used</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="4.32">to you know really tote this sort of</text>
  <text start="305.21" dur="4.96">environmentalist which was very</text>
  <text start="306.93" dur="5.91">left-wing narrative I don&amp;#39;t anymore I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="310.17" dur="5.85">seen things that have caused me to</text>
  <text start="312.84" dur="6.32">question them and and and see things</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="5.49">differently but I want I want to help</text>
  <text start="319.16" dur="4.15">people become better individuals and</text>
  <text start="321.51" dur="4.44">take take take charge of their lives and</text>
  <text start="323.31" dur="6.36">that&amp;#39;s the anarchist in me yes it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="325.95" dur="7.14">take control of your life stop blaming</text>
  <text start="329.67" dur="5.31">everything on on other people and take</text>
  <text start="333.09" dur="3.36">care of yourself you know I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="334.98" dur="4.71">really influenced by Jordan Peterson</text>
  <text start="336.45" dur="4.74">actually me too yeah yeah I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="339.69" dur="4.23">following Jordan Peterson for a long</text>
  <text start="341.19" dur="5.01">time well not a long time but well</text>
  <text start="343.92" dur="6.93">before he got popular I was I was really</text>
  <text start="346.2" dur="6.27">interested in his stuff and but you know</text>
  <text start="350.85" dur="4.71">it wasn&amp;#39;t just Jordan Peterson that got</text>
  <text start="352.47" dur="6.03">me on that that track of thinking he</text>
  <text start="355.56" dur="5.91">really helped me understand some things</text>
  <text start="358.5" dur="5.49">but I&amp;#39;ve been really on that track of</text>
  <text start="361.47" dur="4.53">like fostering the strong individual and</text>
  <text start="363.99" dur="4.41">giving and giving them the tools that</text>
  <text start="366" dur="3.78">they need to be that and and for me it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.4" dur="2.85">farming and there&amp;#39;s other things that I</text>
  <text start="369.78" dur="4.32">know I can share and help people with</text>
  <text start="371.25" dur="5.07">and inspire them to do but but I do</text>
  <text start="374.1" dur="4.08">consider myself an expert in small-scale</text>
  <text start="376.32" dur="4.2">agriculture and so if I could if I can</text>
  <text start="378.18" dur="5.07">help be part of the change in that</text>
  <text start="380.52" dur="4.35">regard then then that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="383.25" dur="3.12">vehicle to do that and that&amp;#39;s where my</text>
  <text start="384.87" dur="3.42">channel my youtube channel comes in my</text>
  <text start="386.37" dur="4.56">book because I&amp;#39;m not out talking about</text>
  <text start="388.29" dur="4.86">queueing on or you know the banking</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="3.48">system or the state and all that just</text>
  <text start="393.15" dur="2.79">because it&amp;#39;s like what&amp;#39;s the point</text>
  <text start="394.41" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s already great people out there</text>
  <text start="395.94" dur="4.16">talking about those things that I know</text>
  <text start="398.25" dur="3.5">that my voice would be more</text>
  <text start="400.1" dur="3.57">more effective in agriculture because</text>
  <text start="401.75" dur="3.27">that&amp;#39;s what I consider myself at experts</text>
  <text start="403.67" dur="2.82">important I mean we have to take back</text>
  <text start="405.02" dur="5.46">the food in the health supplies that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.49" dur="5.79">just it yeah that&amp;#39;s it so I mean I&amp;#39;m you</text>
  <text start="410.48" dur="3.99">know I&amp;#39;ve always been fascinated by</text>
  <text start="412.28" dur="4.26">growing things but I&amp;#39;m more of an animal</text>
  <text start="414.47" dur="3.21">guy like I&amp;#39;ve got into you know</text>
  <text start="416.54" dur="3.36">different kinds of livestock and</text>
  <text start="417.68" dur="3.6">different points in my life and I love</text>
  <text start="419.9" dur="2.94">having animals around and that&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="421.28" dur="4.08">been my thing I never really got the</text>
  <text start="422.84" dur="4.62">time in the space to do a lot of</text>
  <text start="425.36" dur="4.77">Agriculture lean microgreens and stuff</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="4.29">like that but what-what just for people</text>
  <text start="430.13" dur="3.48">who haven&amp;#39;t if they haven&amp;#39;t heard of</text>
  <text start="431.75" dur="3.36">your channel for some reason they</text>
  <text start="433.61" dur="3.42">haven&amp;#39;t heard about you like what are</text>
  <text start="435.11" dur="3.66">the things that you you teach people I</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="3.3">mean you teach them to be not only</text>
  <text start="438.77" dur="4.11">self-sufficient but to make them like</text>
  <text start="440.33" dur="5.31">good money doing it and yeah without</text>
  <text start="442.88" dur="6.32">having to go buy land or any of the</text>
  <text start="445.64" dur="6.45">house that&amp;#39;s it I think you know and I</text>
  <text start="449.2" dur="5.98">do a lot of work with other farmers and</text>
  <text start="452.09" dur="5.1">on other farms now too and so my my my</text>
  <text start="455.18" dur="5.91">scope of agriculture has broadened quite</text>
  <text start="457.19" dur="6.87">a bit and it&amp;#39;s actually helped me define</text>
  <text start="461.09" dur="6">what I do better I think I&amp;#39;m what I</text>
  <text start="464.06" dur="6.39">really offer as far as agriculture goes</text>
  <text start="467.09" dur="6.75">is how do boots drop something on a</text>
  <text start="470.45" dur="6">really DIY level like basically how to</text>
  <text start="473.84" dur="5.79">start a farm on a few thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="476.45" dur="7.13">and and get some cash flow happening I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="479.63" dur="6.9">not the expert on if you want to scale</text>
  <text start="483.58" dur="4.72">to a larger like size farm there&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="486.53" dur="6.09">people out there like my good friend</text>
  <text start="488.3" dur="6.3">John Martin 48 he&amp;#39;s probably more if</text>
  <text start="492.62" dur="5.04">somebody want to scale up to multi acre</text>
  <text start="494.6" dur="4.95">you know they might go to him but for</text>
  <text start="497.66" dur="4.11">for people who want to start a farm in</text>
  <text start="499.55" dur="3.87">the suburbs I&amp;#39;m the guy like I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="501.77" dur="3.15">it and I and I have thousands of</text>
  <text start="503.42" dur="4.38">protegees now around the world that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="504.92" dur="5.64">also done so I think that&amp;#39;s really not</text>
  <text start="507.8" dur="4.56">where I&amp;#39;m at is I can help people start</text>
  <text start="510.56" dur="4.08">a farm in their backyard or their own</text>
  <text start="512.36" dur="3.929">garage and whether that be doing</text>
  <text start="514.64" dur="4.829">microgreens in their apartment or</text>
  <text start="516.289" dur="5.911">basement and scaling that into you know</text>
  <text start="519.469" dur="5.041">a 1-1 acre market garden that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="522.2" dur="3.54">my niche and and and where I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="524.51" dur="3.6">help people I&amp;#39;m trying to help people</text>
  <text start="525.74" dur="4.74">get started in it and then there&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="528.11" dur="4.5">experts out there who can help them get</text>
  <text start="530.48" dur="3.6">further down the road but I mean I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="532.61" dur="3.84">made a living for nine</text>
  <text start="534.08" dur="4.74">on this tiny little farm and so I think</text>
  <text start="536.45" dur="4.65">I think for for many people that&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="538.82" dur="4.949">enough it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a it can provide a</text>
  <text start="541.1" dur="5.34">great quality of life and also can the</text>
  <text start="543.769" dur="5.041">one advantage I see in my farming</text>
  <text start="546.44" dur="4.709">opposed to other other people out there</text>
  <text start="548.81" dur="4.92">is that because I show people how to</text>
  <text start="551.149" dur="5.011">operate so small and lean is that you</text>
  <text start="553.73" dur="3.99">can actually take vacations with my kind</text>

  <text start="751.64" dur="5.91">when I started that was my first</text>
  <text start="753.56" dur="8.04">exposure to libertarianism and even then</text>
  <text start="757.55" dur="6.27">like I I was still a left-leaning</text>
  <text start="761.6" dur="5.1">liberal now I would consider myself like</text>

  <text start="783.92" dur="4.65">he talked about cuz he quoted a lot of</text>
  <text start="785.69" dur="5.91">these great libertarians like Hayek and</text>

  <text start="863.61" dur="5.92">you know post Jim Crow all of these</text>
  <text start="867.19" dur="4.26">liberal policies turned out to be</text>
  <text start="869.53" dur="3.9">repressive of blocks because it created</text>
  <text start="871.45" dur="5.79">a glass ceiling and created incentives</text>
  <text start="873.43" dur="5.64">to break up the family and it&amp;#39;s a pretty</text>
  <text start="877.24" dur="5.1">shocking documentaries made in the 70s</text>

  <text start="884.5" dur="4.32">opened up a can of worms to me and then</text>

  <text start="897.22" dur="4.83">you know and I just thought that kind of</text>
  <text start="899.38" dur="6.08">opened it opened it up to me and I think</text>
  <text start="902.05" dur="6.539">once I started to understand the</text>
  <text start="905.46" dur="4.54">incentive structure in human society is</text>
  <text start="908.589" dur="4.111">everything else started to make more</text>
  <text start="910" dur="3.81">sense to me mm-hm and then I would you</text>
  <text start="912.7" dur="3.06">know cuz I&amp;#39;ve always been a person</text>

  <text start="922.75" dur="5.01">listen to you never know I could be</text>
  <text start="924.82" dur="4.59">wrong I could be wrong and ever since I</text>

  <text start="929.41" dur="4.41">been aware of my biases my confirmation</text>
  <text start="931.57" dur="3.42">biases and so I&amp;#39;ve always been willing</text>
  <text start="933.82" dur="3.15">to go down a rabbit hole</text>
  <text start="934.99" dur="4.44">but then I&amp;#39;m like I don&amp;#39;t know and I</text>

  <text start="1249.37" dur="4.33">this is you know something that might be</text>
  <text start="1251.54" dur="5.31">have more utility to people listening is</text>
  <text start="1253.7" dur="4.92">like what I have learned is you got to</text>
  <text start="1256.85" dur="4.71">look at all the things you do that you</text>
  <text start="1258.62" dur="4.14">can do and if you can line up the things</text>

  <text start="1275.99" dur="5.7">effective at me and if effective I mean</text>
  <text start="1278.42" dur="4.92">in a in an objective sense that because</text>
  <text start="1281.69" dur="3.06">to say that you&amp;#39;re good at is somewhat</text>
  <text start="1283.34" dur="3.54">subjective to you like yeah I think I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1284.75" dur="4.08">pretty good at this but I&amp;#39;m when I say</text>
  <text start="1286.88" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;re effective at it what I mean is</text>

  <text start="1301.07" dur="3.54">thinking us off my head but I&amp;#39;ve really</text>
  <text start="1302.69" dur="4.52">just doubled down on those things and so</text>
  <text start="1304.61" dur="6.99">for me these kinds of conversations</text>
  <text start="1307.21" dur="6.61">aren&amp;#39;t something that I&amp;#39;m super good at</text>
  <text start="1311.6" dur="5.13">like I know I&amp;#39;ve changed some people&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1753.64" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;ve ever done and I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="1756.34" dur="4.56">the stuff that&amp;#39;s coming at him is just</text>
  <text start="1758.32" dur="5.46">because people are so fearful of the</text>
  <text start="1760.9" dur="6.57">fact that he will destroy your ideology</text>
  <text start="1763.78" dur="5.58">yeah yeah he does so nicely and he</text>
  <text start="1767.47" dur="3.35">doesn&amp;#39;t so nicely like met the debate he</text>

  <text start="1861.61" dur="4.11">let it fraction ate them and so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1863.59" dur="4.5">like sort of this four-fold plan so</text>
  <text start="1865.72" dur="4.2">yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s a weapon because the</text>
  <text start="1868.09" dur="3.54">Soviets were really smart they were like</text>
  <text start="1869.92" dur="3.66">well instead of fighting wars with</text>
  <text start="1871.63" dur="3.63">casualties let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s create</text>
  <text start="1873.58" dur="4.76">ideological war and let them fight it</text>
  <text start="1875.26" dur="7.4">out themselves and so is like it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1878.34" dur="7.42">what is it it&amp;#39;s demoralize destabilize</text>
  <text start="1882.66" dur="5.62">crisis normalization so it&amp;#39;s a four fold</text>
  <text start="1885.76" dur="5.01">plan they would demoralize people by</text>
  <text start="1888.28" dur="4.65">basically subjecting them to identity</text>
  <text start="1890.77" dur="4.74">politics mm-hmm and then everybody</text>
  <text start="1892.93" dur="4.95">starts fighting which is today and then</text>
  <text start="1895.51" dur="4.8">that leads to destabilization which is</text>
  <text start="1897.88" dur="4.47">also today then that leads to a crisis</text>
  <text start="1900.31" dur="4.5">which maybe we haven&amp;#39;t seen yet and then</text>
  <text start="1902.35" dur="5.88">that crisis is that is when they assure</text>
  <text start="1904.81" dur="6.72">in their solution yeah the solution</text>
  <text start="1908.23" dur="5.4">problem reaction solution yeah yeah and</text>

  <text start="1954.16" dur="6.3">accept it it&amp;#39;s I know a lot of Marxists</text>
  <text start="1957.01" dur="4.83">I know a lot of people that are so that</text>
  <text start="1960.46" dur="2.94">wasn&amp;#39;t real Marxism you know that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1968.08" dur="4.38">be happy and they don&amp;#39;t think too deeply</text>
  <text start="1969.76" dur="4.32">about what the actual like solutions are</text>
  <text start="1972.46" dur="4.23">so they just want to give people free</text>
  <text start="1974.08" dur="4.56">stuff and yeah you know and that just</text>

  <text start="1982.3" dur="7.05">that yeah I think I know a decent amount</text>
  <text start="1985.75" dur="5.73">about Marx and like he was right in some</text>
  <text start="1989.35" dur="3.51">ways and I think that&amp;#39;s the thing the</text>
  <text start="1991.48" dur="2.67">thing that he was right about is the</text>
  <text start="1992.86" dur="3.87">thing that strikes a chord with most</text>
  <text start="1994.15" dur="4.26">people and I I see that in my space like</text>
  <text start="1996.73" dur="2.68">in the permaculture space and</text>
  <text start="1998.41" dur="3.73">sustainable agriculture space</text>
  <text start="1999.41" dur="4.2">lotta Marxists you know they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2002.14" dur="3.39">necessarily call themselves Marxist but</text>
  <text start="2003.61" dur="3.6">they are its they&amp;#39;re like that whole</text>
  <text start="2005.53" dur="4.11">ideology and permaculture it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2007.21" dur="7.29">almost all of them are it&amp;#39;s crazy I mean</text>
  <text start="2009.64" dur="8.79">they recognize things like you know how</text>
  <text start="2014.5" dur="6.12">hierarchy is can be corrupt and how you</text>
  <text start="2018.43" dur="3.6">know Marx is right about capital it does</text>
  <text start="2020.62" dur="2.73">it does concentrate upwards but</text>
  <text start="2022.03" dur="4.86">everything else does - that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2023.35" dur="4.98">problem it&amp;#39;s like yeah it&amp;#39;s like and</text>
  <text start="2026.89" dur="3.06">Pete and Peterson did a really good job</text>
  <text start="2028.33" dur="3.24">at articulating it like that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="2029.95" dur="3.27">I&amp;#39;ve been switched onto for a long time</text>

  <text start="2445.06" dur="4.56">can&amp;#39;t even comprehend and I think with</text>
  <text start="2447.28" dur="5.01">that stuff that might be what it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2449.62" dur="4.2">like people like you you when I first</text>

  <text start="3386.19" dur="6.36">yeah and it&amp;#39;s like any but the problem</text>
  <text start="3388.95" dur="4.83">is is it&amp;#39;s hard to convey things like</text>

  <text start="3427.17" dur="5.399">turn their lives around and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3429.299" dur="5.82">horrible that like in Hollywood all like</text>
  <text start="3432.569" dur="5.01">all the black actors are like horrible</text>
  <text start="3435.119" dur="3.901">role models like I I actually the one</text>
  <text start="3437.579" dur="4.201">thing I do agree with some of the social</text>
  <text start="3439.02" dur="4.68">justice warriors is that I agree that</text>
  <text start="3441.78" dur="3.69">there is some serious racism in society</text>
  <text start="3443.7" dur="5.01">I just don&amp;#39;t think it comes from the</text>
  <text start="3445.47" dur="5.49">place they think yeah no absolutely I</text>
  <text start="3448.71" dur="5.55">think it comes totally from the liberal</text>
  <text start="3450.96" dur="6.149">left and it&amp;#39;s all about perpetuating the</text>
  <text start="3454.26" dur="5.46">welfare state perpetuating this image of</text>

  <text start="3467.91" dur="2.51">you&amp;#39;re gonna find</text>
  <text start="3468.71" dur="4.08">quickly that they&amp;#39;re not the stereotypes</text>
  <text start="3470.42" dur="4.41">that are on television but Hollywood</text>
  <text start="3472.79" dur="4.079">perpetuates these stereotypes and I</text>
  <text start="3474.83" dur="3.69">think they&amp;#39;re absolutely racist and I</text>
  <text start="3476.869" dur="4.381">think that&amp;#39;s where the racism comes from</text>
  <text start="3478.52" dur="4.65">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the ones out there</text>
  <text start="3481.25" dur="2.88">screaming racist are usually the racist</text>
  <text start="3483.17" dur="3.419">like anti five</text>

  <text start="3492.92" dur="5.52">it is a you know it&amp;#39;s finally that</text>
  <text start="3497.27" dur="2.43">people have gotten to the point where</text>
  <text start="3498.44" dur="3.51">enough was enough and people have woken</text>
  <text start="3499.7" dur="4.11">up now you know we&amp;#39;ve been down the the</text>
  <text start="3501.95" dur="3.419">dark part of it but there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="3503.81" dur="4.2">reason to be positive there really is</text>
  <text start="3505.369" dur="5.151">like there is and I think this is a</text>
  <text start="3508.01" dur="5.7">cultural war it&amp;#39;s not a political war I</text>
  <text start="3510.52" dur="4.93">really really do believe I know Andrew</text>
  <text start="3513.71" dur="3.21">Breitbart said it he made the statement</text>
  <text start="3515.45" dur="2.94">famous but he wasn&amp;#39;t the first one to</text>
  <text start="3516.92" dur="3.57">say it that politics is downstream from</text>
  <text start="3518.39" dur="4.44">culture I really truly do believe that I</text>
  <text start="3520.49" dur="4.14">think that&amp;#39;s why Peterson is becoming so</text>
  <text start="3522.83" dur="4.47">world famous is because he understands</text>
  <text start="3524.63" dur="6.42">go after the culture mm-hmm don&amp;#39;t waste</text>

  <text start="3531.05" dur="4.309">mean I&amp;#39;m seeing in Canada it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="3533.06" dur="6.72">exciting like the Liberals have made</text>
  <text start="3535.359" dur="5.98">such a mess of things that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3539.78" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;ve been really exposed to</text>
  <text start="3541.339" dur="5.611">charlatans because Trudeau is just this</text>

  <text start="3546.95" dur="5.13">an aristocrat you know like you grew up</text>
  <text start="3549.05" dur="4.559">yeah yeah you know as a Marxist but it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="3553.609" dur="3.871">to do anything and so but he just runs</text>
  <text start="3555.32" dur="4.049">that he just runs the ideology it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="3557.48" dur="4.47">a it&amp;#39;s like a broken tape recorder with</text>
  <text start="3559.369" dur="4.851">him and I think more and more people are</text>
  <text start="3561.95" dur="5.639">seeing that and they&amp;#39;re going like this</text>
  <text start="3564.22" dur="6.19">people who rant off about this ideology</text>
  <text start="3567.589" dur="4.231">are probably charlatans and so my hope</text>
  <text start="3570.41" dur="3.63">is that that&amp;#39;s gonna make some changes</text>
  <text start="3571.82" dur="4.89">here as far as making real changes in</text>
  <text start="3574.04" dur="5.19">like why you know I&amp;#39;m really into the</text>

  <text start="4187.25" dur="2.94">in our world has been created as a</text>
  <text start="4188.96" dur="3.45">result of credit</text>
  <text start="4190.19" dur="4.59">now that credit has been provided by the</text>
  <text start="4192.41" dur="4.59">elites the bankers right the Fiat system</text>
  <text start="4194.78" dur="4.35">the fractional reserve lending and so</text>
  <text start="4197" dur="3.36">that&amp;#39;s the thing that I wonder like I</text>
  <text start="4199.13" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t know is there something we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="4200.36" dur="5.16">understanding on it I mean I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="4202.43" dur="6.27">I think I think it&amp;#39;s the technology and</text>
  <text start="4205.52" dur="5.58">the you know like capitalism increase</text>
  <text start="4208.7" dur="4.05">the quality of life like 70 times or the</text>
  <text start="4211.1" dur="4.92">efficiency the productivity like 70</text>
  <text start="4212.75" dur="5.73">times and then have the workweek yeah I</text>
  <text start="4216.02" dur="4.11">think that kind of system and plus all</text>
  <text start="4218.48" dur="3.27">the new technology that we have access</text>
  <text start="4220.13" dur="3.93">to making us so much more productive</text>
  <text start="4221.75" dur="3.9">would have freed us by now only we would</text>
  <text start="4224.06" dur="2.82">be we would even have to barely work</text>
  <text start="4225.65" dur="5.4">anymore by now if we didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="4226.88" dur="6.15">accept parasites totally makes me think</text>
  <text start="4231.05" dur="4.74">of that meme that was popular for a</text>
  <text start="4233.03" dur="5.37">while it was like this futuristic shot</text>
  <text start="4235.79" dur="4.35">of like spaceships in these like cloud</text>
  <text start="4238.4" dur="4.68">cities like out of Star Wars it was like</text>
  <text start="4240.14" dur="4.89">yeah stage one suppose well it was it</text>
  <text start="4243.08" dur="5.34">was like if Nick this is what the world</text>
  <text start="4245.03" dur="3.99">would look like if Nikola Tesla family</text>
  <text start="4248.42" dur="2.28">line</text>
  <text start="4249.02" dur="3.39">lived on and instead of the Rothschilds</text>
  <text start="4250.7" dur="4.65">or something like that you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4252.41" dur="4.5">yeah you know it&amp;#39;s interesting I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4255.35" dur="2.88">talk about it often because it&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="4256.91" dur="3.45">doesn&amp;#39;t seem relevant anymore but</text>
  <text start="4258.23" dur="3.6">Trump&amp;#39;s like uncle or somebody was the</text>
  <text start="4260.36" dur="3.3">guy who helped declassify or not</text>
  <text start="4261.83" dur="5.55">declassify but I guess classify those</text>
  <text start="4263.66" dur="6.57">papers so Trump&amp;#39;s late relative was</text>
  <text start="4267.38" dur="6.51">involved with the Tesla stuff said that</text>
  <text start="4270.23" dur="5.19">who knows what he interesting it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="4273.89" dur="6.42">maze I&amp;#39;m een the thing the thing is with</text>
  <text start="4275.42" dur="7.02">all that stuff that helps me see the</text>
  <text start="4280.31" dur="4.35">reality at least how I perceiving it now</text>
  <text start="4282.44" dur="3.3">is that everything in this world is on a</text>
  <text start="4284.66" dur="3.36">need-to-know basis</text>
  <text start="4285.74" dur="4.92">now everything whether you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="4288.02" dur="4.2">dishwasher at a restaurant or you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4290.66" dur="4.98">working in the government or you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="4292.22" dur="4.83">the top level of the CIA you everything</text>
  <text start="4295.64" dur="3.12">is on a need-to-know basis there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="4297.05" dur="3.42">need for the dishwasher at a restaurant</text>
  <text start="4298.76" dur="3.57">to know all the inner workings of the</text>
  <text start="4300.47" dur="3.57">business so if you understand that as</text>
  <text start="4302.33" dur="3.96">sort of a universal principle it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4304.04" dur="5.85">really easy to see how some of this</text>
  <text start="4306.29" dur="5.55">stuff would could be you know and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4309.89" dur="4.14">really easy to understand conspiracies</text>
  <text start="4311.84" dur="4.11">in general in that way it&amp;#39;s like why</text>
  <text start="4314.03" dur="3.63">would in what louder</text>
  <text start="4315.95" dur="4.5">why would have voted in politician need</text>
  <text start="4317.66" dur="5.1">to know all the inner workings of the</text>
  <text start="4320.45" dur="3.84">CIA they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t need to know</text>
  <text start="4322.76" dur="4.47">therefore they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t even get</text>
  <text start="4324.29" dur="4.47">to I mean there&amp;#39;s so many like secret</text>
  <text start="4327.23" dur="4.59">rules and laws and everything else but</text>
  <text start="4328.76" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ve basically cordoned off a lot of</text>
  <text start="4331.82" dur="6.18">the intelligence community from even</text>
  <text start="4333.08" dur="6.72">presidents and everything else well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4338" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s interesting to see Trump kind of</text>
  <text start="4339.8" dur="4.05">revoked the clearance level of some of</text>
  <text start="4342.02" dur="5.85">these people in the CIA he&amp;#39;s going after</text>
  <text start="4343.85" dur="6.18">them he&amp;#39;s interesting yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4347.87" dur="4.17">interesting because I mean is it even</text>
  <text start="4350.03" dur="4.26">controversial to say that the CIA is</text>
  <text start="4352.04" dur="3.81">like the main drug running operation in</text>
  <text start="4354.29" dur="2.79">the world like you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4355.85" dur="3.3">controversial it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="4357.08" dur="3.9">everybody accepts it and then if the</text>
  <text start="4359.15" dur="5.1">child trafficking thing can come out and</text>
  <text start="4360.98" dur="6.12">that can be known then I think that&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="4364.25" dur="5.25">mentioned this something called the</text>
  <text start="4367.1" dur="4.95">Overton Window like two years ago no one</text>
  <text start="4369.5" dur="5.16">knew fake news no one knew deep state</text>
  <text start="4372.05" dur="4.02">except yeah Luther&amp;#39;s like hardcore truth</text>
  <text start="4374.66" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s like people been around for a</text>
  <text start="4376.07" dur="4.89">while how now fake news and deep state</text>
  <text start="4379.22" dur="3.81">or just household terms and the traffic</text>
  <text start="4380.96" dur="4.11">absolutely annually getting more and</text>
  <text start="4383.03" dur="3.39">more and more ingrained in the psyche</text>
  <text start="4385.07" dur="3.18">it&amp;#39;s out there people are starting to</text>
  <text start="4386.42" dur="3.84">hear about that&amp;#39;s right it&amp;#39;s a cultural</text>
  <text start="4388.25" dur="4.29">zeitgeist that&amp;#39;s what I call it changing</text>
  <text start="4390.26" dur="3.87">everything it was it was interesting</text>
  <text start="4392.54" dur="3.9">actually I&amp;#39;ve been I&amp;#39;ve been I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
