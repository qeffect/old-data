  <text start="36.41" dur="7.38">and become permanent or not basically</text>
  <text start="39.739" dur="5.971">this is the response she gets for losing</text>
  <text start="43.79" dur="3.69">all of these sponsors for Fox which has</text>
  <text start="45.71" dur="5.99">always been a controlled opposition kind</text>
  <text start="47.48" dur="8.94">of lefty version of conservative news</text>
  <text start="51.7" dur="7.27">and she she stood up to David Hogg said</text>
  <text start="56.42" dur="4.89">he was whining and that alone was able</text>
  <text start="58.97" dur="4.609">to get one of the most popular news</text>
  <text start="61.31" dur="5.879">hosts on the right in the world</text>

  <text start="75.29" dur="4.2">phone call last week after Putin&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="77.06" dur="4.229">re-election quote if you want to have an</text>
  <text start="79.49" dur="7.35">arms race we can do that but I&amp;#39;ll win</text>
  <text start="81.289" dur="8.25">and quote this is from NBC News quote</text>
  <text start="86.84" dur="4.589">again Trump added that he hoped that</text>
  <text start="89.539" dur="3.661">Putin&amp;#39;s comments were just election</text>
  <text start="91.429" dur="4.32">rhetoric and bragged that he just</text>
  <text start="93.2" dur="5.76">secured a $700 I&amp;#39;m sorry 700 billion</text>
  <text start="95.749" dur="5.66">dollar defense budget the largest the US</text>
  <text start="98.96" dur="4.589">has ever had</text>
  <text start="101.409" dur="4.721">he said according to one of the</text>
  <text start="103.549" dur="4.68">officials and afterward the president</text>
  <text start="106.13" dur="3.72">gave no hint of tensions when he told</text>
  <text start="108.229" dur="4.23">reporters that the two leaders had a</text>
  <text start="109.85" dur="4.799">very good call and that he plans to meet</text>
  <text start="112.459" dur="2.671">with Putin soon to discuss curtailing an</text>
  <text start="114.649" dur="3.15">arms race</text>
  <text start="115.13" dur="8.399">end quote this is quad rememba see that</text>
  <text start="117.799" dur="8.1">time so that&amp;#39;s interesting I I take</text>
  <text start="123.529" dur="4.171">everything that the official media says</text>
  <text start="125.899" dur="4.11">between Russia and Trump and all of that</text>
  <text start="127.7" dur="4.71">with a big grain of salt because I</text>
  <text start="130.009" dur="4.021">really don&amp;#39;t think that these two guys</text>
  <text start="132.41" dur="5.67">who are pretty brilliant both of them</text>
  <text start="134.03" dur="5.46">are going to be overtly going to war I</text>
  <text start="138.08" dur="2.7">think these are just political</text>
  <text start="139.49" dur="3.36">showmanship</text>
  <text start="140.78" dur="3.96">kind of distracting the media or</text>
  <text start="142.85" dur="3">something I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t I think that</text>
  <text start="144.74" dur="2.49">they have some back-channel</text>
  <text start="145.85" dur="6">open and they&amp;#39;re gonna actually be able</text>
  <text start="147.23" dur="6.63">to prevent a real war so but of course</text>
  <text start="151.85" dur="4.08">Trump is doing some pretty strong moves</text>
  <text start="153.86" dur="3.96">with you know sanctions and kicking out</text>
  <text start="155.93" dur="3.36">diplomats things like that and the UK</text>
  <text start="157.82" dur="3.84">are kicking out the diplomats they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="159.29" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;ve got this mysterious rifles case</text>
  <text start="161.66" dur="4.2">where these two were poisoned to death</text>
  <text start="163.67" dur="4.29">and and even though the Russian citizens</text>
  <text start="165.86" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re not a Russia&amp;#39;s basically kicked</text>
  <text start="167.96" dur="3.96">out of the investigation and then all of</text>
  <text start="170.6" dur="4.2">these things were happening as this</text>
  <text start="171.92" dur="5.51">excuse of you know Russia poisoning</text>
  <text start="174.8" dur="8.28">these people and this is just all BS</text>
  <text start="177.43" dur="9.07">it&amp;#39;s all psyops at this point which is a</text>
  <text start="183.08" dur="6.03">word that&amp;#39;s been much overused lately if</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="5.46">you&amp;#39;ve watched my video yesterday in</text>
  <text start="189.11" dur="6.6">addressing rebutting some of the points</text>
  <text start="191.96" dur="6.98">from a I am about Q SIOP is just a word</text>
  <text start="195.71" dur="3.23">getting thrown around a lot lately</text>
  <text start="200.02" dur="9.25">high heels are a PSYOP anyway Fox News</text>
  <text start="204.38" dur="7.5">is saying that Trump is freezing more</text>
  <text start="209.27" dur="6.09">than 200 million in funds for the</text>

  <text start="215.36" dur="4.05">reassessment of the role the US should</text>
  <text start="217.31" dur="3.6">play in the drawn-out conflict there</text>
  <text start="219.41" dur="3.99">actually that&amp;#39;s from The Wall Street</text>
  <text start="220.91" dur="4.47">Journal but Fox is reporting on that so</text>
  <text start="223.4" dur="4.02">Trump has already said he wants to pull</text>
  <text start="225.38" dur="3.87">out of Syria and now he&amp;#39;s pulling funds</text>
  <text start="227.42" dur="3.45">away from the rebuilding effort and all</text>
  <text start="229.25" dur="2.97">of that so he&amp;#39;s pretty serious about it</text>
  <text start="230.87" dur="2.85">and he wants to get out of there and</text>
  <text start="232.22" dur="4.02">hoisted money and time</text>
