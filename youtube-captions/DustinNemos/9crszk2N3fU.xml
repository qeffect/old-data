  <text start="27.51" dur="7.95">Mary yeah it is it is an honor and a</text>
  <text start="32.91" dur="3.72">pleasure to meet you we chatted you up a</text>
  <text start="35.46" dur="3.39">little bit and I&amp;#39;ve already probably</text>
  <text start="36.63" dur="6.9">inflated your ego before the fourth of</text>
  <text start="38.85" dur="6.299">video but so you know I I talked about</text>
  <text start="43.53" dur="3.24">economics on my show I talk about a lot</text>
  <text start="45.149" dur="3.811">of things on my show health economics</text>
  <text start="46.77" dur="3.78">politics but you know there&amp;#39;s big stuff</text>
  <text start="48.96" dur="3.93">in the market the reset is coming I</text>
  <text start="50.55" dur="4.47">think everybody fear you know they feel</text>
  <text start="52.89" dur="3.48">something people may not know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="55.02" dur="4.559">going to happen they may not know how to</text>
  <text start="56.37" dur="6">how to to follow these things now I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="59.579" dur="4.351">got some questions for you but if you</text>
  <text start="62.37" dur="5.97">don&amp;#39;t mind I&amp;#39;m just gonna jump into the</text>
  <text start="63.93" dur="6.479">list all right all right okay so first</text>
  <text start="68.34" dur="3.63">of all the physical markets and people</text>
  <text start="70.409" dur="3.541">have been buying gold and silver for so</text>
  <text start="71.97" dur="4.11">long I&amp;#39;m one of them waiting on things</text>
  <text start="73.95" dur="4.739">to turn always promising that things are</text>
  <text start="76.08" dur="4.77">about to happen and it never does and we</text>
  <text start="78.689" dur="3.991">know who are in the market that the big</text>
  <text start="80.85" dur="4.019">guys are playing with the ETFs and the</text>
  <text start="82.68" dur="5.25">paper markets and they&amp;#39;re just squashing</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="4.71">the price with manipulation right one of</text>
  <text start="87.93" dur="3.81">the things I want to ask you know on a</text>
  <text start="89.579" dur="4.711">personal note and for others is how long</text>
  <text start="91.74" dur="5.91">that can hold and are there any signs of</text>
  <text start="94.29" dur="5.31">it cracking well you know it can</text>
  <text start="97.65" dur="5.759">definitely last a lot longer than</text>
  <text start="99.6" dur="6.269">anybody would anticipate that it could</text>
  <text start="103.409" dur="4.471">because after all when they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="4.051">the way the rules are working they</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="5.64">simply change how they account for</text>
  <text start="109.92" dur="7.53">things so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really hard to say</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="6.599">exactly when that part of the</text>
  <text start="117.45" dur="5.64">manipulation will stop because you can</text>
  <text start="120.119" dur="6.591">even look down in Venezuela and on the</text>
  <text start="123.09" dur="7.88">normal market the price of gold was</text>
  <text start="126.71" dur="7.21">exploding and has been really since 2013</text>
  <text start="130.97" dur="6.58">but the official price of</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="6.36">Gold was held down until February 7th</text>
  <text start="137.55" dur="5.13">and then and this is the piece that</text>
  <text start="140.28" dur="5.13">people need to remember okay number one</text>
  <text start="142.68" dur="7.889">all in due time just not necessarily</text>
  <text start="145.41" dur="8.78">mine but at some point that is actually</text>
  <text start="150.569" dur="9">how the reset is performed is by</text>
  <text start="154.19" dur="10.99">revaluing the fiat currency against gold</text>
  <text start="159.569" dur="10.861">money so bullion or monetary gold so it</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="7.529">will last until they either lose control</text>
  <text start="170.43" dur="5.88">of it because we&amp;#39;ve certainly witnessed</text>
  <text start="172.709" dur="7.011">that in 2008 when you saw the paper</text>
  <text start="176.31" dur="6.3">markets you know plunging in both the</text>
  <text start="179.72" dur="7.03">spot gold market went down like 32</text>
  <text start="182.61" dur="6.93">percent during the crisis and the the</text>
  <text start="186.75" dur="6.15">mining stocks also plunged but in the</text>
  <text start="189.54" dur="5.37">physical only market which is not</text>
  <text start="192.9" dur="5.459">visible if all you&amp;#39;re watching is the</text>
  <text start="194.91" dur="6.09">computer or the TV then we saw those</text>
  <text start="198.359" dur="4.561">actually the physical markets there was</text>
  <text start="201" dur="4.14">scarcity so you couldn&amp;#39;t get your hands</text>
  <text start="202.92" dur="6.36">on stuff I mean I remember having to</text>
  <text start="205.14" dur="5.7">wait three months for delivery this time</text>
  <text start="209.28" dur="3.9">I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re going to have that</text>
  <text start="210.84" dur="5.73">option to wait three months for delivery</text>
  <text start="213.18" dur="5.79">frankly because so much of that so much</text>
  <text start="216.57" dur="4.41">of the physical gold and silver has</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="5.43">already been pulled off the market and</text>
  <text start="220.98" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s not coming back on by anybody that</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="5.459">really understands what&amp;#39;s happening but</text>
  <text start="227.34" dur="5.1">I can tell you for the collectible</text>
  <text start="229.859" dur="6.931">market that&amp;#39;s when those coins made</text>
  <text start="232.44" dur="8.07">there this trend high was as those paper</text>
  <text start="236.79" dur="7.43">markets were plunging so you know</text>
  <text start="240.51" dur="8.61">they&amp;#39;ll continue to do that as long as</text>
  <text start="244.22" dur="7.96">it serves their purpose to keep you away</text>
  <text start="249.12" dur="5.55">from participating in the gold and</text>
  <text start="252.18" dur="5.369">silver market paper they don&amp;#39;t care so</text>
  <text start="254.67" dur="6.659">much of you do ETFs because that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="257.549" dur="6.211">a contract to a trust it&amp;#39;s not actually</text>
  <text start="261.329" dur="5.071">the physical metal you know it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="263.76" dur="3.71">the guys at the top of that food chain</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="3.65">like aji</text>
  <text start="267.47" dur="6.51">P Morgan that can take physical delivery</text>
  <text start="270.05" dur="6.72">of the gold or the silver that&amp;#39;s inside</text>
  <text start="273.98" dur="6.36">of ETSU or I could not do that we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="276.77" dur="6.84">authorized so they can manipulate the</text>
  <text start="280.34" dur="7.5">market in so many different ways so</text>
  <text start="283.61" dur="6.51">cheaply that yeah they they can keep</text>
  <text start="287.84" dur="4.35">this up for a while it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="290.12" dur="5.97">on the physical market you&amp;#39;d actually be</text>
  <text start="292.19" dur="7.02">able to buy it though because it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="296.09" dur="5.55">scarcity piece in the physical market if</text>
  <text start="299.21" dur="4.79">the wholesalers have a hard time getting</text>
  <text start="301.64" dur="5.1">it they&amp;#39;re gonna charge you a premium</text>
  <text start="304" dur="7.03">regardless of what the spot price says</text>
  <text start="306.74" dur="7.59">and we know that even just from 2008 and</text>
  <text start="311.03" dur="6.96">even more recently we had some we had</text>
  <text start="314.33" dur="3.84">some delays in delivery so everyone have</text>
  <text start="317.99" dur="2.31">it</text>
  <text start="318.17" dur="4.2">I remember the premiums I remember the</text>
  <text start="320.3" dur="4.23">long wait times I&amp;#39;m hearing now from</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="5.13">people in the industry that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.53" dur="5.04">getting a little bit more scarce and you</text>
  <text start="327.5" dur="4.77">know we all we&amp;#39;ve heard the statistics</text>
  <text start="329.57" dur="5.97">that silver is running out what&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="332.27" dur="7.11">take on that well it is because it</text>
  <text start="335.54" dur="7.74">actually gets used up in industry and</text>
  <text start="339.38" dur="5.91">silver is also a byproduct you know so</text>
  <text start="343.28" dur="4.59">they don&amp;#39;t actually go and and mine</text>
  <text start="345.29" dur="4.53">specifically for silver silvers more of</text>
  <text start="347.87" dur="5.25">a byproduct so yeah it is getting used</text>
  <text start="349.82" dur="8.55">up and it&amp;#39;s used across the entire</text>
  <text start="353.12" dur="7.98">global economic spectrum as is gold but</text>
  <text start="358.37" dur="4.74">the difference between the two is gold</text>
  <text start="361.1" dur="4.89">while it&amp;#39;s used across the economic</text>
  <text start="363.11" dur="5.07">spectrum that doesn&amp;#39;t get used up so</text>
  <text start="365.99" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s a better tool for accounting which</text>
  <text start="368.18" dur="5.549">is why they revalue the currency against</text>
  <text start="370.43" dur="6.989">gold and not silver but both of them are</text>
  <text start="373.729" dur="7.831">monetary metals and both of them there</text>
  <text start="377.419" dur="4.801">is a finite amount of it period end of</text>
  <text start="381.56" dur="5.25">discussion</text>
  <text start="382.22" dur="7.71">even with new find of some you know gold</text>
  <text start="386.81" dur="6">horn somewhere there&amp;#39;s only so much of</text>
  <text start="389.93" dur="5.73">it as compared to any of these digital</text>
  <text start="392.81" dur="5.4">or fiat money products which are frankly</text>
  <text start="395.66" dur="5.82">unlimited because that&amp;#39;s a button push</text>
  <text start="398.21" dur="5.91">on a computer so you mentioned</text>
  <text start="401.48" dur="5.4">waylynn and i know that i&amp;#39;m a silver guy</text>
  <text start="404.12" dur="5.61">more than a gold guy but i like i like</text>
  <text start="406.88" dur="4.77">the you know the ratio yeah I was gonna</text>
  <text start="409.73" dur="3.12">ask but I like the ratio you know I</text>
  <text start="411.65" dur="2.73">think it&amp;#39;s like eighty to one or</text>
  <text start="412.85" dur="3.71">something right now historically it was</text>
  <text start="414.38" dur="4.47">I think it&amp;#39;s 16 to one right so</text>
  <text start="416.56" dur="5.65">Venezuela gold actually did better</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="6.03">during the reset at least when I heard a</text>
  <text start="422.21" dur="4.23">while back and and I kind of expected</text>
  <text start="424.88" dur="4.95">silver would do better and I guess that</text>
  <text start="426.44" dur="6.03">was more Gold&amp;#39;s reputation as money than</text>
  <text start="429.83" dur="4.5">anything but what do you think obviously</text>
  <text start="432.47" dur="3.96">the the physical markets are shrinking</text>
  <text start="434.33" dur="3.75">but what do you think is gonna happen in</text>
  <text start="436.43" dur="5.94">the US will it be gold that benefits the</text>
  <text start="438.08" dur="6.51">most well I mean historically that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.37" dur="6.18">what&amp;#39;s supported not just in Venezuela</text>
  <text start="444.59" dur="7.62">but I recently did a piece and we saw</text>
  <text start="448.55" dur="6.45">the same kind of behavior in in</text>
  <text start="452.21" dur="6">Germany&amp;#39;s hyperinflation in the 20s so</text>
  <text start="455" dur="4.64">and that&amp;#39;s because the reset occurs</text>
  <text start="458.21" dur="6.26">against gold</text>
  <text start="459.64" dur="10.06">having said that keep in mind for me I</text>
  <text start="464.47" dur="8.94">don&amp;#39;t really care so much about that you</text>
  <text start="469.7" dur="6.51">know gold to silver ratio because</text>
  <text start="473.41" dur="4.69">mentally you&amp;#39;re people are thinking</text>
  <text start="476.21" dur="4.32">about it like a trade oh well Silver&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.1" dur="6.21">going to go up a whole lot more in terms</text>
  <text start="480.53" dur="6.72">of fiat but the reality is is when this</text>
  <text start="484.31" dur="4.88">happens when it becomes visible to</text>
  <text start="487.25" dur="5.55">everybody that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="489.19" dur="6.22">hyperinflationary event both gold and</text>
  <text start="492.8" dur="7.77">silver will hold your purchasing power</text>
  <text start="495.41" dur="8.24">so for me it&amp;#39;s about functionality what</text>
  <text start="500.57" dur="7.43">is it that I want to accomplish and</text>
  <text start="503.65" dur="8.17">silver is for me about bar durability</text>
  <text start="508" dur="5.89">simply because if I want to buy a pint</text>
  <text start="511.82" dur="4.38">of strawberries I don&amp;#39;t want to take a</text>
  <text start="513.89" dur="5.13">gold Queen in there you can carry a lot</text>
  <text start="516.2" dur="6.45">more wealth in a small package with gold</text>
  <text start="519.02" dur="7.56">but change becomes irrelevant so I want</text>
  <text start="522.65" dur="6.66">to go in with a pre 64 dime which is you</text>
  <text start="526.58" dur="5.15">know roughly not quite but tenth of an</text>
  <text start="529.31" dur="5.12">ounce or a quarter or</text>
  <text start="531.73" dur="6.57">half an ounce or an ounce depending upon</text>
  <text start="534.43" dur="8.19">what I want to purchase or convert that</text>
  <text start="538.3" dur="8.039">silver into I that for me is the</text>
  <text start="542.62" dur="8.37">function of silver and speaking about</text>
  <text start="546.339" dur="6.271">what happened with Venezuela or Germany</text>
  <text start="550.99" dur="3.93">or any of those other places</text>
  <text start="552.61" dur="5.25">where during the reset and</text>
  <text start="554.92" dur="5.13">hyperinflation at some point there is a</text>
  <text start="557.86" dur="5.58">division between the performance of gold</text>
  <text start="560.05" dur="6.86">or silver if you have enough bar durable</text>
  <text start="563.44" dur="5.85">gold where if you have any gold you will</text>
  <text start="566.91" dur="4.869">chances are and they can guarantee this</text>
  <text start="569.29" dur="4.89">but chances are because this has been</text>
  <text start="571.779" dur="6.151">true 100 percent of the time you can</text>
  <text start="574.18" dur="8.219">always convert your gold into silver at</text>
  <text start="577.93" dur="6.87">that time so that you have more of it so</text>
  <text start="582.399" dur="5.341">you want a certain level of silver going</text>
  <text start="584.8" dur="5.42">into it because for for a while it</text>
  <text start="587.74" dur="8.099">maintains and probably shrinks that</text>
  <text start="590.22" dur="8.229">ratio but and part of the strategy that</text>
  <text start="595.839" dur="8.041">I developed just based upon repeatable</text>
  <text start="598.449" dur="8.25">patterns that we execute here really if</text>
  <text start="603.88" dur="5.43">you have your bar durable gold then when</text>
  <text start="606.699" dur="5.241">that division happens and gold starts to</text>
  <text start="609.31" dur="5.31">outperform in terms of fiat anyway</text>
  <text start="611.94" dur="5.829">silver well you can always just convert</text>
  <text start="614.62" dur="5.82">small pieces of gold into the silver so</text>
  <text start="617.769" dur="6.57">that in reality you are now getting the</text>
  <text start="620.44" dur="7.05">same level of purchasing power</text>
  <text start="624.339" dur="6.06">you&amp;#39;re not losing it with the silver but</text>
  <text start="627.49" dur="6.48">but understand this two part and part of</text>
  <text start="630.399" dur="5.761">the strategy you want cash as well that</text>
  <text start="633.97" dur="4.549">is completely outside of the system</text>
  <text start="636.16" dur="4.71">because for people that&amp;#39;s the most</text>
  <text start="638.519" dur="4.151">recognizable money at this point</text>
  <text start="640.87" dur="4.949">so even though we know it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="642.67" dur="8.06">lose all value you still have to have a</text>
  <text start="645.819" dur="8.041">certain level of that for the initial</text>
  <text start="650.73" dur="7.24">hyperinflationary push then you want the</text>
  <text start="653.86" dur="7.26">silver for that next push and then you</text>
  <text start="657.97" dur="5.4">want some of the martyr Abul gold that</text>
  <text start="661.12" dur="6.3">you can convert it to the silver which</text>
  <text start="663.37" dur="7.11">is more easily usable for your</text>
  <text start="667.42" dur="5.669">day-to-day purchases and and then you</text>
  <text start="670.48" dur="4.08">won&amp;#39;t experience that big discrepancy</text>
  <text start="673.089" dur="4.141">did that make sense it was a little</text>
  <text start="674.56" dur="3.63">complicated no yeah it did okay</text>
  <text start="677.23" dur="2.7">as you were talking about it a</text>
  <text start="678.19" dur="3.57">hyperinflation and such I want to get</text>
  <text start="679.93" dur="4.02">into that I remember seeing the images</text>
  <text start="681.76" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s circled really widely from</text>
  <text start="683.95" dur="4.829">Venezuela it&amp;#39;s like a plate of chicken</text>
  <text start="686.14" dur="4.83">or a pizza you know a loaf of bread and</text>
  <text start="688.779" dur="7.041">it&amp;#39;s a stack of cash on a table to be</text>
  <text start="690.97" dur="8.369">able to buy it and that pretty wild yeah</text>
  <text start="695.82" dur="4.87">so how do you compare this is a big one</text>
  <text start="699.339" dur="3.511">for me because there&amp;#39;s two narratives</text>
  <text start="700.69" dur="3.57">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s the Trump is is kicking</text>
  <text start="702.85" dur="2.88">butt in the economy and everything is</text>
  <text start="704.26" dur="3.84">great and then there&amp;#39;s the everything</text>
  <text start="705.73" dur="4.83">bubble fiscal cliff about the pop now I</text>
  <text start="708.1" dur="5.1">love Trump but I don&amp;#39;t believe that the</text>
  <text start="710.56" dur="5.76">economy is doing all that well I think</text>
  <text start="713.2" dur="7.05">we&amp;#39;re facing the end somehow what do you</text>
  <text start="716.32" dur="6.48">think well a hundred percent but you</text>
  <text start="720.25" dur="5.04">know part of what everybody needs to</text>
  <text start="722.8" dur="4.53">understand is if a government official</text>
  <text start="725.29" dur="6.77">or a central banker actually came out</text>
  <text start="727.33" dur="8.46">and and openly told you the truth then</text>
  <text start="732.06" dur="6.37">behavior would change like that and they</text>
  <text start="735.79" dur="5.85">don&amp;#39;t want the behavior to change so</text>
  <text start="738.43" dur="7.59">their job is to be a cheerleader to your</text>
  <text start="741.64" dur="8.389">face while they are ie to your back if</text>
  <text start="746.02" dur="6.6">you know what I&amp;#39;m talking about actually</text>
  <text start="750.029" dur="6.041">this is a report that I&amp;#39;m that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="752.62" dur="6.93">running later today or had just run</text>
  <text start="756.07" dur="5.88">depending upon when this airs and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="759.55" dur="5.13">really all on the fate of the consumer</text>
  <text start="761.95" dur="3.9">and it is definitely in everything but</text>
  <text start="764.68" dur="5.31">well that&amp;#39;s all where all that money</text>
  <text start="765.85" dur="7.37">printing went it hyper-inflated re hyper</text>
  <text start="769.99" dur="6.27">inflated real estate stocks bonds</text>
  <text start="773.22" dur="5.92">derivatives okay so there&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="776.26" dur="6.87">everything bubble but at the same time</text>
  <text start="779.14" dur="7.56">consumer spending is almost 70 percent</text>
  <text start="783.13" dur="5.73">of the global GDP and the balance of the</text>
  <text start="786.7" dur="5.82">spending comes from the government which</text>
  <text start="788.86" dur="6.15">taxpayers are responsible and all of</text>
  <text start="792.52" dur="6.33">that spending or not all of it but a</text>
  <text start="795.01" dur="7.5">most by a very wide margin most of that</text>
  <text start="798.85" dur="7.86">spending is done by taking on debt me</text>
  <text start="802.51" dur="8.1">prior to 89 income plus savings was</text>
  <text start="806.71" dur="7.95">enough to spend to to accommodate your</text>
  <text start="810.61" dur="6.99">spending but after 89 that&amp;#39;s when that</text>
  <text start="814.66" dur="6.11">shifted and inflation because wages</text>
  <text start="817.6" dur="5.64">never keep pace with inflation by design</text>
  <text start="820.77" dur="3.61">people in order to maintain their</text>
  <text start="823.24" dur="4.08">standard of living</text>
  <text start="824.38" dur="5.52">started on started taking on more and</text>
  <text start="827.32" dur="8.25">more and more and more and more and more</text>
  <text start="829.9" dur="9.18">debt now the key in here is that that</text>
  <text start="835.57" dur="9.3">debt has been turned into derivative</text>
  <text start="839.08" dur="8.06">securities by Wall Street and turned</text>
  <text start="844.87" dur="6">into products that are now fully</text>
  <text start="847.14" dur="6.72">embedded in retirement plans because</text>
  <text start="850.87" dur="7.47">they are in mutual funds they are in</text>
  <text start="853.86" dur="10.54">ETFs that means variable annuities 401ks</text>
  <text start="858.34" dur="9.33">IRAs 403 B&amp;#39;s you name it has these</text>
  <text start="864.4" dur="7.22">derivative time bombs embedded deeply</text>
  <text start="867.67" dur="8.67">within the system so if the consumer</text>
  <text start="871.62" dur="11.16">stops repaying stop spending stops</text>
  <text start="876.34" dur="8.61">taking on debt that could easily be</text>
  <text start="882.78" dur="7.69">overwhelming to the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="884.95" dur="9.81">ability to hide the next catastrophe so</text>
  <text start="890.47" dur="6.63">that brings to mind of course retirement</text>
  <text start="894.76" dur="4.8">Social Security Medicare all of these</text>
  <text start="897.1" dur="3.84">things that they can&amp;#39;t afford as it is</text>
  <text start="899.56" dur="3.39">anyway those things are going bankrupt</text>
  <text start="900.94" dur="5.28">but do those things just die overnight</text>
  <text start="902.95" dur="6.06">during the reset well they don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="906.22" dur="5.19">die overnight and you know I think part</text>
  <text start="909.01" dur="5.79">of it is they will use the crisis to</text>
  <text start="911.41" dur="7.26">pull back some benefits that they pay</text>
  <text start="914.8" dur="6.18">but even if they index and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="918.67" dur="7.43">started in this country president Trump</text>
  <text start="920.98" dur="7.56">is now proposing to index some gains</text>
  <text start="926.1" dur="4.51">against inflation</text>
  <text start="928.54" dur="5.13">right now they&amp;#39;ve indexed Social</text>
  <text start="930.61" dur="5.13">Security against inflation and of course</text>
  <text start="933.67" dur="3.36">it never really keeps up because they</text>
  <text start="935.74" dur="5.46">just change how they account for</text>
  <text start="937.03" dur="5.19">inflation but that is proposing the</text>
  <text start="941.2" dur="6.65">indexation</text>
  <text start="942.22" dur="8.73">of capital gains is definitely a way to</text>
  <text start="947.85" dur="6.19">let you know that high high high</text>
  <text start="950.95" dur="5.16">inflation is coming because that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="954.04" dur="4.77">they did in Israel Israel was running</text>
  <text start="956.11" dur="4.65">huge inflation&amp;#39;s as they were becoming a</text>
  <text start="958.81" dur="5.01">new country and they still are</text>
  <text start="960.76" dur="4.8">and they indexed everything to the</text>
  <text start="963.82" dur="4.56">inflation so that people wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="965.56" dur="4.68">complain about it so now this is a</text>
  <text start="968.38" dur="5.76">recent thing for them to talk about</text>
  <text start="970.24" dur="6.24">indexing gains to inflation and that</text>
  <text start="974.14" dur="5.31">sends up for me that sends up a big red</text>
  <text start="976.48" dur="6.2">flag because they know darn well that</text>
  <text start="979.45" dur="9.21">they are going to push prices higher</text>
  <text start="982.68" dur="8.53">faster okay you know so even if they</text>
  <text start="988.66" dur="6.15">index say Social Security payments and</text>
  <text start="991.21" dur="6.3">you get more it doesn&amp;#39;t matter as you</text>
  <text start="994.81" dur="5.49">said in Venezuela you know if it takes a</text>
  <text start="997.51" dur="5.55">stack of bills like this they can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1000.3" dur="4.37">see the top of my hand to buy a loaf of</text>
  <text start="1003.06" dur="6.12">bread it&amp;#39;s because those bills have no</text>
  <text start="1004.67" dur="7.33">malleus so Social Security even if they</text>
  <text start="1009.18" dur="7.11">don&amp;#39;t stop it because I think there&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="1012" dur="6.15">too big an outcry over it it&amp;#39;s frankly</text>
  <text start="1016.29" dur="4.94">irrelevant because they&amp;#39;re giving you</text>
  <text start="1018.15" dur="6.059">dollars that have no value big deal</text>
  <text start="1021.23" dur="5.979">so with inflation you bring up an</text>
  <text start="1024.209" dur="4.891">interesting thing there we&amp;#39;ve seen just</text>
  <text start="1027.209" dur="3.87">years and years of money printing just</text>
  <text start="1029.1" dur="3.81">massive money printing and and we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1031.079" dur="3.061">good inflation I mean there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1032.91" dur="2.94">official rate then there&amp;#39;s the shadow</text>
  <text start="1034.14" dur="5.58">stats rate where they track it the old</text>
  <text start="1035.85" dur="6.84">way and it&amp;#39;s much much higher and I yeah</text>
  <text start="1039.72" dur="4.65">and I tell people you know go look at</text>
  <text start="1042.69" dur="3">your personal dig top ten items that you</text>
  <text start="1044.37" dur="3.54">buy and compare it to ten years ago</text>
  <text start="1045.69" dur="5.61">that&amp;#39;s like your kind of your personal</text>
  <text start="1047.91" dur="5.88">inflation rate but where where is all</text>
  <text start="1051.3" dur="4.11">that money that they&amp;#39;ve been printing is</text>
  <text start="1053.79" dur="3.45">it just the big guys they&amp;#39;re just buying</text>
  <text start="1055.41" dur="4.2">up stocks and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s leading to</text>
  <text start="1057.24" dur="4.23">this everything bubble well you know</text>
  <text start="1059.61" dur="2.66">that that&amp;#39;s a really interesting point</text>
  <text start="1061.47" dur="3.5">because</text>
  <text start="1062.27" dur="4.86">number one it&amp;#39;s easier for us to say</text>
  <text start="1064.97" dur="4.44">that they&amp;#39;re just printing money but it</text>
  <text start="1067.13" dur="4.02">really is much more than that because in</text>
  <text start="1069.41" dur="2.97">order to print that money they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1071.15" dur="4.14">creating debt</text>
  <text start="1072.38" dur="5.64">so remember taxpayers are responsible</text>
  <text start="1075.29" dur="5.22">for any government debt that they take</text>
  <text start="1078.02" dur="5.37">on and we&amp;#39;re running massive deficits</text>
  <text start="1080.51" dur="5.31">and this will happen now as far you know</text>
  <text start="1083.39" dur="4.32">as the eye can see and the biggest part</text>
  <text start="1085.82" dur="7.59">of that happened when the crisis began</text>
  <text start="1087.71" dur="8.79">in 2007 2008 so but what happens when</text>
  <text start="1093.41" dur="6.3">they do that is the value of the</text>
  <text start="1096.5" dur="6.06">currency goes down and down and down and</text>
  <text start="1099.71" dur="5.94">so whoever gets to use that currency</text>
  <text start="1102.56" dur="4.56">first which would be corporations</text>
  <text start="1105.65" dur="3.78">because you have the central banks that</text>
  <text start="1107.12" dur="4.56">create that currency if you think of it</text>
  <text start="1109.43" dur="4.5">like a wheel and the central banks are</text>
  <text start="1111.68" dur="4.53">in the center of the wheel and then the</text>
  <text start="1113.93" dur="4.59">first thing you have are the banks</text>
  <text start="1116.21" dur="4.23">around it the government does not go</text>
  <text start="1118.52" dur="3.72">directly the central bank to borrow that</text>
  <text start="1120.44" dur="4.74">money they have to go do to the</text>
  <text start="1122.24" dur="5.7">commercial banks to borrow that money</text>
  <text start="1125.18" dur="5.6">that the central bank creates that puts</text>
  <text start="1127.94" dur="6.12">the commercial banks at a huge advantage</text>
  <text start="1130.78" dur="6.34">then it goes to the government and other</text>
  <text start="1134.06" dur="4.74">corporations by the time it trickles</text>
  <text start="1137.12" dur="4.95">through to you and me we&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="1138.8" dur="7.74">furthest side of the spoke it has lost a</text>
  <text start="1142.07" dur="6.9">tremendous amount of value and all of</text>
  <text start="1146.54" dur="4.35">this new money I mean you know you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1148.97" dur="3.57">been following my work I always look at</text>
  <text start="1150.89" dur="3.12">what are the insiders doing for</text>
  <text start="1152.54" dur="5.85">themselves right</text>
  <text start="1154.01" dur="6.72">and so in in you know theory and even in</text>
  <text start="1158.39" dur="5.73">reality because of the way the system is</text>
  <text start="1160.73" dur="8.04">set up the stock markets are supposed to</text>
  <text start="1164.12" dur="8.16">inflate at or near or above the true</text>
  <text start="1168.77" dur="7.8">rate of inflation and who really owns</text>
  <text start="1172.28" dur="6.81">most of the stocks but it&amp;#39;s the insiders</text>
  <text start="1176.57" dur="6.63">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the one-percenters that do and</text>
  <text start="1179.09" dur="7.17">even for those of us that that believe</text>
  <text start="1183.2" dur="5.85">that we own it through 401ks or other</text>
  <text start="1186.26" dur="6.72">retirement plans or pension plans well</text>
  <text start="1189.05" dur="6.75">in reality what you have is a contract</text>
  <text start="1192.98" dur="6.6">with those that that</text>
  <text start="1195.8" dur="6.9">manage other people&amp;#39;s money and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1199.58" dur="4.8">another way to generate hidden fees that</text>
  <text start="1202.7" dur="5.9">you don&amp;#39;t even realize that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1204.38" dur="7.67">paying so really a wealth transfer</text>
  <text start="1208.6" dur="6.91">mechanism from the many from the masses</text>
  <text start="1212.05" dur="6.22">to the few to those at the top the one</text>
  <text start="1215.51" dur="4.86">percenters the bankers the corporations</text>
  <text start="1218.27" dur="2.91">and look at corporate profits I mean</text>
  <text start="1220.37" dur="5.37">good God</text>
  <text start="1221.18" dur="7.86">they are exploding exploding the highest</text>
  <text start="1225.74" dur="6.12">levels ever and and understand this</text>
  <text start="1229.04" dur="5.07">about those corporate profits well those</text>
  <text start="1231.86" dur="5.34">are coming from sales right the sales of</text>
  <text start="1234.11" dur="4.68">their goods and their services and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1237.2" dur="5.16">the sales of those goods and those</text>
  <text start="1238.79" dur="8.3">services that defined what the inflation</text>
  <text start="1242.36" dur="7.56">rate is but wages don&amp;#39;t keep pace with</text>
  <text start="1247.09" dur="6.31">those goods and the services and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1249.92" dur="5.28">what enables that income inequality so</text>
  <text start="1253.4" dur="4.56">that the guys at the top of the food</text>
  <text start="1255.2" dur="5.01">chain the insiders that are managing</text>
  <text start="1257.96" dur="5.25">this Corp these corporations the boards</text>
  <text start="1260.21" dur="6.54">of directors etc that&amp;#39;s where that money</text>
  <text start="1263.21" dur="6.54">is going the John Q public heads not</text>
  <text start="1266.75" dur="7.14">going there and that&amp;#39;s really the big</text>
  <text start="1269.75" dur="7.98">problem because the question is how much</text>
  <text start="1273.89" dur="6.81">more debt can the consumer absorb now</text>
  <text start="1277.73" dur="5.76">they did just change the way that the</text>
  <text start="1280.7" dur="5.6">credit ratings were calculated and that</text>
  <text start="1283.49" dur="6.54">did that went into effect the end of</text>
  <text start="1286.3" dur="6.37">2017 and then of course we know we had</text>
  <text start="1290.03" dur="5.79">the tax breaks and the repatriation that</text>
  <text start="1292.67" dur="6.66">came in early eighteen right but that</text>
  <text start="1295.82" dur="6.54">whole point eighteen percent of people</text>
  <text start="1299.33" dur="6.33">with a credit history and this is like</text>
  <text start="1302.36" dur="6.39">the lower end of the credit scale their</text>
  <text start="1305.66" dur="6.96">scores were raised by up to thirty</text>
  <text start="1308.75" dur="9.89">points or more which enables those that</text>
  <text start="1312.62" dur="10.68">can least afford it to take on credit oh</text>
  <text start="1318.64" dur="6.73">my god this is like don&amp;#39;t change</text>
  <text start="1323.3" dur="4.99">behavior because we need you to keep</text>
  <text start="1325.37" dur="4.99">borrowing it&amp;#39;s a product it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1328.29" dur="4.14">everything and this is how we make our</text>
  <text start="1330.36" dur="6.2">money so we don&amp;#39;t care if you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1332.43" dur="6.84">repay it just keep borrowing</text>
  <text start="1336.56" dur="5.17">unbelievable these guys these guys</text>
  <text start="1339.27" dur="5.49">benefit it doesn&amp;#39;t matter they can they</text>
  <text start="1341.73" dur="5.55">can withstand a big crash but I assume</text>
  <text start="1344.76" dur="5.43">that this is going to be about I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="1347.28" dur="6.42">what happened everybody&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="1350.19" dur="6.48">what happened in 2008 the big guys got</text>
  <text start="1353.7" dur="5.4">bailed out mm-hmm and it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="1356.67" dur="4.71">worse this time right Oh much worse</text>
  <text start="1359.1" dur="5.01">because they don&amp;#39;t have the same depth</text>
  <text start="1361.38" dur="5.36">of tools that they had been in and</text>
  <text start="1364.11" dur="4.89">what&amp;#39;s been really interesting for me is</text>
  <text start="1366.74" dur="4.54">listening like this morning I was</text>
  <text start="1369" dur="6.71">listening to Bernanke Geithner and</text>
  <text start="1371.28" dur="11.85">Paulson at the Brookings Institute</text>
  <text start="1375.71" dur="13.23">justifying their behavior and I wonder</text>
  <text start="1383.13" dur="9.72">when I listen to them I wonder about</text>
  <text start="1388.94" dur="6.46">their the truth and what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1392.85" dur="5.67">because Neil Barofsky if you guys have</text>
  <text start="1395.4" dur="6.15">not read his book bailout makes you I</text>
  <text start="1398.52" dur="5.22">think it&amp;#39;s over there you might want to</text>
  <text start="1401.55" dur="3.69">read this I&amp;#39;m gonna reach out to him I</text>
  <text start="1403.74" dur="3.74">don&amp;#39;t know if I didn&amp;#39;t get him to come</text>
  <text start="1405.24" dur="5.94">on I&amp;#39;ve tried before and he said no but</text>
  <text start="1407.48" dur="6.37">he should be talking about it because he</text>
  <text start="1411.18" dur="5.7">was there thank you and I you know I</text>

  <text start="1426.72" dur="6.42">they came up with the bail you know</text>
  <text start="1428.88" dur="6.84">everybody big out and what he says in</text>
  <text start="1433.14" dur="5.91">his book and his experience is very</text>
  <text start="1435.72" dur="5.88">different to what I hear these guys who</text>
  <text start="1439.05" dur="5.46">want to create this legacy in this image</text>
  <text start="1441.6" dur="6.42">of we were only trying to help and and</text>
  <text start="1444.51" dur="5.82">all of that well come on you know when</text>
  <text start="1448.02" dur="4.35">you when you as an individual look at</text>
  <text start="1450.33" dur="5.22">what&amp;#39;s happening on Main Street</text>
  <text start="1452.37" dur="5.55">you know because memories are short we</text>
  <text start="1455.55" dur="6.24">don&amp;#39;t really remember it but we&amp;#39;re still</text>

  <text start="1467.19" dur="7.68">bailed out not the individuals we we eat</text>
  <text start="1472.29" dur="3.81">it I think if I recalled Bernanke&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1474.87" dur="5.54">same guy that said the internet would</text>
  <text start="1476.1" dur="8.94">never take off he said a lot of things I</text>
  <text start="1480.41" dur="6.91">see this in a while but years ago I saw</text>
  <text start="1485.04" dur="6.54">somebody put together a little montage</text>
  <text start="1487.32" dur="5.25">of everything he said and he was wrong</text>
  <text start="1491.58" dur="4.41">wrong wrong wrong wrong</text>
  <text start="1492.57" dur="6.66">because again his job was to be a</text>
  <text start="1495.99" dur="6.87">cheerleader not tell you the truth his</text>
  <text start="1499.23" dur="5.97">job is to make you feel confident that</text>
  <text start="1502.86" dur="5.069">they know what they&amp;#39;re doing and they</text>
  <text start="1505.2" dur="6.06">have they have it under control</text>
  <text start="1507.929" dur="8.821">fair enough and you know you mentioned</text>
  <text start="1511.26" dur="8.669">about this next crisis hmm well I</text>
  <text start="1516.75" dur="6.21">recently read a piece by Larry Summers</text>
  <text start="1519.929" dur="6.361">and it was at the I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it was</text>
  <text start="1522.96" dur="5.43">for the Peter G Peterson foundation and</text>
  <text start="1526.29" dur="5.43">he put together this whole little</text>
  <text start="1528.39" dur="6.06">PowerPoint on how wonderful and</text>
  <text start="1531.72" dur="5.22">successful quantitative easing was</text>
  <text start="1534.45" dur="5.88">because really the central bank&amp;#39;s made</text>
  <text start="1536.94" dur="6.36">an awful lot of profit off of this QE</text>
  <text start="1540.33" dur="6.96">and all of these bail outs which that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1543.3" dur="7.59">not really their job but what he also</text>
  <text start="1547.29" dur="6.06">was talking about was this next crisis</text>
  <text start="1550.89" dur="5.1">and the tools that he sees and his an</text>
  <text start="1553.35" dur="5.09">extra Sheree secretary instrumental and</text>
  <text start="1555.99" dur="6.12">blocking oversight of derivatives</text>
  <text start="1558.44" dur="5.53">destroyed the division between deposit</text>
  <text start="1562.11" dur="3.69">taking a risk taking banks so he is</text>
  <text start="1563.97" dur="4.86">definitely not my favorite person on</text>
  <text start="1565.8" dur="5.97">this planet however he did have this</text>
  <text start="1568.83" dur="5.31">sweet little list of the tools that they</text>
  <text start="1571.77" dur="5.78">would use and the helicopter money is</text>
  <text start="1574.14" dur="7.02">one of those big tools more QE for sure</text>
  <text start="1577.55" dur="5.29">but helicopter money so people think</text>
  <text start="1581.16" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re getting something for free but</text>
  <text start="1582.84" dur="5.37">it has no value already starting</text>
  <text start="1585.24" dur="6.84">California I think yeah they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1588.21" dur="5.79">testing it yeah yeah so I&amp;#39;ve heard this</text>
  <text start="1592.08" dur="4.089">theory and I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s worth</text>
  <text start="1594" dur="4.509">anything but I&amp;#39;ve heard this theory</text>
  <text start="1596.169" dur="4.32">Trump can kind of foresee he knows this</text>
  <text start="1598.509" dur="4.05">is coming and he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s actually kind of</text>
  <text start="1600.489" dur="4.55">pushing us toward an economic reset do</text>
  <text start="1602.559" dur="7.83">you think that there&amp;#39;s any value to that</text>
  <text start="1605.039" dur="10.33">well I think that President Trump is as</text>
  <text start="1610.389" dur="9.211">smart as a fox so I think that he was</text>
  <text start="1615.369" dur="7.41">aware of what his role was to be inside</text>
  <text start="1619.6" dur="6.509">of this transition he didn&amp;#39;t start it he</text>
  <text start="1622.779" dur="8.911">very well may see it through at least to</text>
  <text start="1626.109" dur="8.971">the crisis but I think that I think that</text>
  <text start="1631.69" dur="8.819">he was aware of what his role was to be</text>
  <text start="1635.08" dur="6.929">and that he&amp;#39;s playing it I know you know</text>
  <text start="1640.509" dur="4.431">I want to talk about the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="1642.009" dur="5.16">and and the death of the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="1644.94" dur="4.179">obviously a lot of countries are now</text>
  <text start="1647.169" dur="5.07">moving outside of using the dollar to</text>
  <text start="1649.119" dur="6">trade oil and that effectively ends our</text>
  <text start="1652.239" dur="4.65">reserve currency status which happens so</text>
  <text start="1655.119" dur="4.62">often it you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not anything</text>
  <text start="1656.889" dur="4.62">to be you know surprised about but what</text>
  <text start="1659.739" dur="3.841">is that going to do combined with all of</text>
  <text start="1661.509" dur="6.66">the other hyperinflation that you see</text>
  <text start="1663.58" dur="7.65">coming well you know so if your viewers</text>
  <text start="1668.169" dur="5.58">understand that to be the world reserve</text>
  <text start="1671.23" dur="4.799">currency means that if you are any</text>
  <text start="1673.749" dur="5.52">government or corporation going outside</text>
  <text start="1676.029" dur="5.701">of your borders to buy you know oil or</text>
  <text start="1679.269" dur="5.61">anything else you know lumber steel</text>
  <text start="1681.73" dur="7.019">medicine but oil was what may helped us</text>
  <text start="1684.879" dur="7.441">retain that status well we&amp;#39;ve actually</text>
  <text start="1688.749" dur="6.721">been losing that we should have lost it</text>
  <text start="1692.32" dur="5.66">in you know in the early 70s and we in</text>
  <text start="1695.47" dur="5.639">fact went to the IMF and gave it back</text>
  <text start="1697.98" dur="7.6">but then Kissinger created the petro</text>
  <text start="1701.109" dur="7.32">dollar so we got to create to keep that</text>
  <text start="1705.58" dur="5.699">advantage because at that point anyway</text>
  <text start="1708.429" dur="7.43">we were the only country that could</text>
  <text start="1711.279" dur="7.441">print or create debt and pay our bills</text>
  <text start="1715.859" dur="6.3">outside of her borders with that debt</text>
  <text start="1718.72" dur="6.149">nobody else could but it was already in</text>
  <text start="1722.159" dur="5.681">2002 and people don&amp;#39;t realize this but</text>
  <text start="1724.869" dur="5.55">the end of 2002 was</text>
  <text start="1727.84" dur="6.42">the first time that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="1730.419" dur="9.921">was forced to buy our government debt</text>
  <text start="1734.26" dur="9.69">and in 2005 I believe it was May of 2005</text>
  <text start="1740.34" dur="7.6">Russia came out and said you will no</text>
  <text start="1743.95" dur="7.109">longer value any of our assets in terms</text>
  <text start="1747.94" dur="6.78">of US dollars from here forward they</text>
  <text start="1751.059" dur="7.891">will be valued in terms of rubles euros</text>
  <text start="1754.72" dur="6.589">or gold so that was actually a very big</text>
  <text start="1758.95" dur="5.699">deal and then of course in the crisis</text>
  <text start="1761.309" dur="8.261">China came out and said what about the</text>
  <text start="1764.649" dur="7.591">SDR which is the internal fiat currency</text>
  <text start="1769.57" dur="6.92">that was created back in 69 to take over</text>
  <text start="1772.24" dur="8.52">as the world reserve currency by the IMF</text>
  <text start="1776.49" dur="6.429">so they tested all of that and one of</text>
  <text start="1780.76" dur="6.409">the mechanisms that they put in place</text>
  <text start="1782.919" dur="7.771">then and tested recently was the</text>
  <text start="1787.169" dur="5.591">substitution fund where if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1790.69" dur="5.099">sitting anywhere in the world and you</text>
  <text start="1792.76" dur="6.09">have u.s. dollar denominated products so</text>
  <text start="1795.789" dur="6.99">bonds or loans or whatever you could</text>
  <text start="1798.85" dur="8.209">deposit them into the IMF substitution</text>
  <text start="1802.779" dur="9.27">fund and the IMF will convert them into</text>
  <text start="1807.059" dur="8.5">SDR denominated that or loans or or</text>
  <text start="1812.049" dur="6.36">whatever this is really critical because</text>
  <text start="1815.559" dur="6.6">it means that all of those dollars that</text>
  <text start="1818.409" dur="7.201">are out there right now being used to</text>
  <text start="1822.159" dur="6.99">buy oil lumber steel whatever they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1825.61" dur="5.929">be useful for that anymore so all of</text>
  <text start="1829.149" dur="6.15">those dollars have to come back here and</text>
  <text start="1831.539" dur="6.431">even though this is a global reset my</text>
  <text start="1835.299" dur="4.681">bet is although everybody&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1837.97" dur="5.429">feel this I mean everybody&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1839.98" dur="6.75">venezuela however i think it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1843.399" dur="5.701">be worse here simply because we have a</text>
  <text start="1846.73" dur="4.53">whole lot more we have to pay the piper</text>
  <text start="1849.1" dur="4.949">we have a whole lot more that garbage</text>
  <text start="1851.26" dur="6.93">that&amp;#39;s out there that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="1854.049" dur="7.291">home to roost and then that will create</text>
  <text start="1858.19" dur="6.15">the opportunity fully</text>
  <text start="1861.34" dur="6.33">for the IMF that really started</text>
  <text start="1864.34" dur="6.69">positioning China as the global economic</text>
  <text start="1867.67" dur="6.87">leader when they included them their</text>
  <text start="1871.03" dur="8.09">currency in the SDR basket and allowed</text>
  <text start="1874.54" dur="8.01">them to issue and crew the first SDR</text>
  <text start="1879.12" dur="8.5">denominated bond and actually tasked</text>
  <text start="1882.55" dur="8.73">them with developing a market for the</text>
  <text start="1887.62" dur="8.1">SDR and there was a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="1891.28" dur="8.13">brouhaha when one of my viewers sent me</text>
  <text start="1895.72" dur="10.13">a link that showed how a Chinese company</text>
  <text start="1899.41" dur="10.71">AC chain created a coin that when</text>
  <text start="1905.85" dur="9.79">purchased with Bitcoin or cerium became</text>
  <text start="1910.12" dur="9.54">and as they are no and and the whole</text>
  <text start="1915.64" dur="10.74">function of that claim is to hold title</text>
  <text start="1919.66" dur="8.94">to physical assets the goal of the IMF</text>
  <text start="1926.38" dur="5.63">is to have is to be world reserve</text>
  <text start="1928.6" dur="7.02">currency and to have all global assets</text>
  <text start="1932.01" dur="6.94">valued in terms of SDR now it&amp;#39;s under</text>
  <text start="1935.62" dur="9.6">the control of the IMF which are all</text>
  <text start="1938.95" dur="8.7">unelected officials and bankers so you</text>
  <text start="1945.22" dur="4.29">know I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m a fan of Kryptos if</text>
  <text start="1947.65" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re decentralized and no one can</text>
  <text start="1949.51" dur="4.35">control them but yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="1952.39" dur="3.21">and that&amp;#39;s the difficulty because they</text>
  <text start="1953.86" dur="6.42">become more and more centralizing it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1955.6" dur="7.32">problem but the West as a whole largely</text>
  <text start="1960.28" dur="4.17">we don&amp;#39;t we see you know mark dice did a</text>
  <text start="1962.92" dur="3.21">video where he offered people a 10 ounce</text>
  <text start="1964.45" dur="3.72">gold bar or a bar of chocolate and</text>
  <text start="1966.13" dur="3.78">nobody wanted the silver or sorry silver</text>

  <text start="1969.91" dur="4.41">to chop me I would have taken the silver</text>
  <text start="1972.01" dur="4.17">exactly like people here don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1974.32" dur="3.93">understand that it&amp;#39;s money the West as a</text>

  <text start="1981.73" dur="5.96">to buy it what happens to us when fiat</text>
  <text start="1984.94" dur="6.33">currencies die compared to other nations</text>
  <text start="1987.69" dur="7.16">well you know years ago I did a study on</text>
  <text start="1991.27" dur="6.24">what happens to all socio-economic</text>
  <text start="1994.85" dur="5.7">classes during these transitions and</text>
  <text start="1997.51" dur="5.26">what I discovered is number one there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2000.55" dur="4.83">a tremendous amount of depopulation</text>
  <text start="2002.77" dur="7.35">through the very young and the very old</text>
  <text start="2005.38" dur="7.98">and infirm but if you are already dirt</text>
  <text start="2010.12" dur="6.72">poor let&amp;#39;s face it there&amp;#39;s only so far</text>
  <text start="2013.36" dur="6.96">down that you can go and if you are</text>
  <text start="2016.84" dur="6.84">wealthy and not leverage leverage is a</text>
  <text start="2020.32" dur="7.23">real key in this whole piece but but</text>
  <text start="2023.68" dur="7.32">usually you know the very wealthy have</text>
  <text start="2027.55" dur="6.24">tangible wealth that&amp;#39;s part of dynastic</text>
  <text start="2031" dur="5.07">wealth so they have the unencumbered</text>
  <text start="2033.79" dur="4.83">real estate they have you know maybe</text>
  <text start="2036.07" dur="7.02">they have canary diamonds and really</text>
  <text start="2038.62" dur="7.94">fine art angle and silver we&amp;#39;re finding</text>
  <text start="2043.09" dur="6.69">that the elite the 1% have been</text>
  <text start="2046.56" dur="5.8">voraciously accumulating collectible</text>
  <text start="2049.78" dur="5.22">coins that you know starting hundreds of</text>
  <text start="2052.36" dur="5.04">thousands and millions of dollars so</text>
  <text start="2055" dur="5.16">they have a lot of wealth and during</text>
  <text start="2057.4" dur="10.67">these transitions they have the ability</text>
  <text start="2060.16" dur="10.71">to buy those assets that decline vastly</text>
  <text start="2068.07" dur="5.5">particularly in terms of fiat during</text>
  <text start="2070.87" dur="5.97">these transitions it is typically the</text>
  <text start="2073.57" dur="5.91">middle class that really has the</text>
  <text start="2076.84" dur="5.19">greatest shift in standard of living</text>
  <text start="2079.48" dur="6.66">because like you just indicated they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2082.03" dur="9.98">not prepared so that&amp;#39;s why my personal</text>
  <text start="2086.14" dur="9.71">motto is food water energy security</text>
  <text start="2092.01" dur="6.94">barter ability wealth preservation and</text>
  <text start="2095.85" dur="6.4">community because these are the things</text>
  <text start="2098.95" dur="6.99">that we need to be able to survive this</text>
  <text start="2102.25" dur="7.59">when the computers say no and there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="2105.94" dur="7.29">value left if you depend on fiat money</text>
  <text start="2109.84" dur="7.11">and fiat money products you then become</text>
  <text start="2113.23" dur="7.22">at the mercy of the government and so</text>
  <text start="2116.95" dur="7.05">food becomes the tippy-top issue and</text>
  <text start="2120.45" dur="6.61">medicine becomes a secondary issue you</text>
  <text start="2124" dur="4.77">need meds and you can&amp;#39;t get them but in</text>
  <text start="2127.06" dur="4.29">your barnable purse</text>
  <text start="2128.77" dur="5.55">that&amp;#39;s where we go back to silver right</text>
  <text start="2131.35" dur="7.7">because an n/bar durable gold which are</text>
  <text start="2134.32" dur="7.26">smaller pieces of gold because silver</text>
  <text start="2139.05" dur="4.569">ensures since it&amp;#39;s used across the</text>

  <text start="2169.24" dur="6.84">or that where that prescription or</text>
  <text start="2173.02" dur="6.09">something like that your bar durable</text>
  <text start="2176.08" dur="4.83">gold you know real estates vulnerable</text>
  <text start="2179.11" dur="4.62">one of the reasons is because the</text>
  <text start="2180.91" dur="4.62">property taxes because you can on the</text>
  <text start="2183.73" dur="4.53">property outright but if you can&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="2185.53" dur="5.61">those property taxes you lose the</text>
  <text start="2188.26" dur="4.5">property and property taxes explode</text>
  <text start="2191.14" dur="3.57">during hyperinflation</text>
  <text start="2192.76" dur="3.69">cuz governments that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how they</text>
  <text start="2194.71" dur="6.3">get the the money to pay their bills</text>
  <text start="2196.45" dur="7.26">it&amp;#39;s the taxpayers and so by having</text>
  <text start="2201.01" dur="4.95">small fractional pieces of gold</text>
  <text start="2203.71" dur="5.07">number one you know and we have</text>
  <text start="2205.96" dur="5.49">everything is formulated based upon</text>
  <text start="2208.78" dur="6.329">historic norms and current true values</text>
  <text start="2211.45" dur="7.11">not Wall Street&amp;#39;s values but true values</text>
  <text start="2215.109" dur="7.051">so you want to make sure that you have</text>
  <text start="2218.56" dur="6.15">enough of those physical metals to be</text>
  <text start="2222.16" dur="5.34">able to pay those property taxes and</text>
  <text start="2224.71" dur="5.22">then as we spoke about earlier even</text>
  <text start="2227.5" dur="5.67">converted into some of those smaller</text>
  <text start="2229.93" dur="6.78">pieces into gold or into silver so that</text>
  <text start="2233.17" dur="6.93">you&amp;#39;re not wasting any of your wealth</text>
  <text start="2236.71" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s the larger pieces and this is what</text>
  <text start="2240.1" dur="6.42">though 1% know that they will then have</text>
  <text start="2243.52" dur="4.86">the ability to convert into income</text>
  <text start="2246.52" dur="5.31">producing assets like for example</text>
  <text start="2248.38" dur="5.82">commercial real estate globally on</text>
  <text start="2251.83" dur="4.68">average and inside of this study I</text>
  <text start="2254.2" dur="4.34">looked at at what happens to the</text>
  <text start="2256.51" dur="4.65">different asset classes as well and</text>
  <text start="2258.54" dur="7.09">globally on average Homer</text>
  <text start="2261.16" dur="6.87">real-estate drops 75% in Japan in the</text>
  <text start="2265.63" dur="4.229">early 90s which is what I personally</text>
  <text start="2268.03" dur="6.059">think it&amp;#39;s gonna look more like that</text>
  <text start="2269.859" dur="6.391">number is 95% so the wealthy those that</text>
  <text start="2274.089" dur="4.02">hold you know that&amp;#39;s why you gotta have</text>
  <text start="2276.25" dur="3.839">gold because it&amp;#39;s hard to do that with</text>
  <text start="2278.109" dur="4.921">with you know a room full of silver</text>
  <text start="2280.089" dur="6.811">where you can do it with you know on</text>
  <text start="2283.03" dur="7.44">seriously on average 25 ounces of gold</text>
  <text start="2286.9" dur="7.469">or the equivalent would buy an entire</text>
  <text start="2290.47" dur="6">city block buildings at all so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2294.369" dur="4.771">what I know people think that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2296.47" dur="5.369">like I love silver I own both of them I</text>
  <text start="2299.14" dur="6">bought more today or yesterday afternoon</text>
  <text start="2301.839" dur="6.24">whenever I bought more and I bought two</text>
  <text start="2305.14" dur="5">collectible midstate 64 coins and I</text>
  <text start="2308.079" dur="7.53">bought a bunch of our durable silver I</text>
  <text start="2310.14" dur="9.33">buy both I own both but I look at what</text>
  <text start="2315.609" dur="7.43">I&amp;#39;m trying to accomplish and then what I</text>
  <text start="2319.47" dur="8.05">convert those fiat pieces of paper into</text>
  <text start="2323.039" dur="6.25">supports a specific goal I mean and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2327.52" dur="5.16">not rocket science just based upon</text>
  <text start="2329.289" dur="5.25">repeatable patterns okay so I was gonna</text>
  <text start="2332.68" dur="4.05">ask is it fair to say basically that</text>
  <text start="2334.539" dur="4.861">everything goes on Black Friday sell</text>
  <text start="2336.73" dur="4.619">during this and if you&amp;#39;ve got gold</text>
  <text start="2339.4" dur="3.959">silver something that&amp;#39;s worth tangible</text>
  <text start="2341.349" dur="4.95">value you can buy up things and become</text>
  <text start="2343.359" dur="6.17">wealthy yes indeed well what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2346.299" dur="6.901">gonna look for is it&amp;#39;s called a cup</text>
  <text start="2349.529" dur="7.441">formation and which is we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="2353.2" dur="6.389">in both the spot gold market and the</text>
  <text start="2356.97" dur="4.78">collectible gold market we&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="2359.589" dur="5.28">double cup so there was one at the start</text>
  <text start="2361.75" dur="5.46">of the trend from I think it varies a</text>
  <text start="2364.869" dur="8.25">little bit between those two areas but</text>
  <text start="2367.21" dur="9.48">from basically 97 ish until 2004 ish and</text>
  <text start="2373.119" dur="6.511">then again it started in 2008 and it</text>
  <text start="2376.69" dur="5.19">continues on in my entire career and</text>
  <text start="2379.63" dur="4.5">I&amp;#39;ve been in these markets you know well</text>
  <text start="2381.88" dur="3.78">I became a stock broker in 86 so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2384.13" dur="3.3">when I would have started to pay</text>
  <text start="2385.66" dur="5.189">attention to that I&amp;#39;ve never seen a</text>
  <text start="2387.43" dur="6.76">double cup before ever never so that</text>
  <text start="2390.849" dur="5.771">tells me what that cup tells me is</text>
  <text start="2394.19" dur="4.5">that the smart money the guys in the</text>
  <text start="2396.62" dur="5.33">know the guys are at the top of this</text>
  <text start="2398.69" dur="5.88">food chain have recognized an</text>
  <text start="2401.95" dur="5.77">undervalued circumstance and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2404.57" dur="5.25">quietly accumulating while they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="2407.72" dur="7.44">everything in their power hence the</text>
  <text start="2409.82" dur="7.56">manipulation to keep you away but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2415.16" dur="5.67">really when you want to buy that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="2417.38" dur="6.96">you want to do it so so yes you&amp;#39;re right</text>
  <text start="2420.83" dur="7.5">it becomes a black fart Friday it is a</text>
  <text start="2424.34" dur="6.9">huge bargain but you want to wait to see</text>
  <text start="2428.33" dur="4.56">that cup formation and that that&amp;#39;s part</text>
  <text start="2431.24" dur="4.74">of the strategy and what we do it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2432.89" dur="5.91">just buying gold and silver I mean you</text>
  <text start="2435.98" dur="5.31">know frankly if you do that in physical</text>
  <text start="2438.8" dur="7.11">form in your possession you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2441.29" dur="7.02">be fine it&amp;#39;s just that the strategy that</text>
  <text start="2445.91" dur="5.67">I develop is based upon the repeatable</text>
  <text start="2448.31" dur="5.49">patterns and our job it&amp;#39;s a relationship</text>
  <text start="2451.58" dur="5.4">through this trend because we want you</text>
  <text start="2453.8" dur="6.15">to know you know what&amp;#39;s going to support</text>
  <text start="2456.98" dur="8.07">your goals when to use it where to use</text>
  <text start="2459.95" dur="7.82">it and when to shift enough I forgot</text>
  <text start="2465.05" dur="5.46">just a few questions left um</text>
  <text start="2467.77" dur="4.63">one briefly how do people pick gold</text>
  <text start="2470.51" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s not you know you get rumors of</text>
  <text start="2472.4" dur="3.66">fake gold tungsten filled with gold all</text>
  <text start="2474.83" dur="3.39">of this stuff that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="2476.06" dur="4.29">I like Silver&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="2478.22" dur="4.34">the smaller denominations of silver it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2480.35" dur="5.43">not worth faking usually but how do you</text>
  <text start="2482.56" dur="4.33">determine that for people that&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="2485.78" dur="4.32">question</text>
  <text start="2486.89" dur="8.76">number one only work with a reputable</text>
  <text start="2490.1" dur="9.11">dealer that uses only mint direct</text>
  <text start="2495.65" dur="9.6">dealers and has absolutely everything</text>
  <text start="2499.21" dur="7.96">certified so that&amp;#39;s one big way I mean I</text>
  <text start="2505.25" dur="3.63">I think that you need to do that anyway</text>
  <text start="2507.17" dur="5.25">because you need to have that to a</text>
  <text start="2508.88" dur="6.99">market but a gold and silver have</text>
  <text start="2512.42" dur="7.05">properties that tungsten and different</text>
  <text start="2515.87" dur="5.94">metals do not have so even if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2519.47" dur="4.53">like out and about and an estate sale or</text>
  <text start="2521.81" dur="4.56">a yard sale or flea market or something</text>
  <text start="2524" dur="4.5">like that and you come across something</text>
  <text start="2526.37" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="2528.5" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s not magnetic so keep a strong</text>
  <text start="2531.62" dur="4.11">magnet in your pocket and you can test</text>
  <text start="2534.08" dur="4.59">it and that&amp;#39;s true for silver and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2535.73" dur="6.18">true for gold and in fact we have a</text>
  <text start="2538.67" dur="6.36">whole checklist of things that you the</text>
  <text start="2541.91" dur="7.25">individual can do on your own to</text>
  <text start="2545.03" dur="7.14">determine is this real or is this fake</text>
  <text start="2549.16" dur="5.56">so if if anybody wants it they and call</text>
  <text start="2552.17" dur="4.98">us at 888 six nine six four six five</text>
  <text start="2554.72" dur="4.14">three and you know talked to one of our</text>
  <text start="2557.15" dur="3.51">precious metals consultant we&amp;#39;ll shoot</text>
  <text start="2558.86" dur="4.5">it out to you so that you can keep it</text>
  <text start="2560.66" dur="6.6">with you and see how you determine these</text>
  <text start="2563.36" dur="5.88">things job which is you know and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2567.26" dur="5.25">simple checklist you know and then</text>
  <text start="2569.24" dur="5.1">there&amp;#39;s equipment I think the piece that</text>
  <text start="2572.51" dur="3.51">we bought mighta cost is eight or nine</text>
  <text start="2574.34" dur="4.71">hundred bucks and there&amp;#39;s all different</text>
  <text start="2576.02" dur="7.08">sized kits so they can go from like you</text>
  <text start="2579.05" dur="7.29">know probably 25 or 30 bucks on up but</text>
  <text start="2583.1" dur="6.54">we got a fantastic one that you put it</text>
  <text start="2586.34" dur="5.97">you put it on this machine and it tells</text>
  <text start="2589.64" dur="7.28">you the purity level of what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2592.31" dur="8.28">looking at and so if it doesn&amp;#39;t register</text>
  <text start="2596.92" dur="6.37">it&amp;#39;s not real in a long ways I remember</text>
  <text start="2600.59" dur="6.09">like I know they have acid test kits and</text>
  <text start="2603.29" dur="6.69">things like that but that&amp;#39;s trouble you</text>
  <text start="2606.68" dur="4.98">know you know it can work as long as you</text>
  <text start="2609.98" dur="3.48">go deep enough so you&amp;#39;re not just if</text>
  <text start="2611.66" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s coated you know you&amp;#39;re not just</text>
  <text start="2613.46" dur="5.07">getting the coating but yeah these</text>
  <text start="2615.98" dur="5.67">little machines are fantastic they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2618.53" dur="5.37">fantastic but if you buy from a</text>
  <text start="2621.65" dur="5.97">reputable dealer who&amp;#39;s working with</text>
  <text start="2623.9" dur="5.85">reputable wholesalers and only using</text>
  <text start="2627.62" dur="4.35">certified products that means they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2629.75" dur="5.01">been tested they&amp;#39;re real and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2631.97" dur="5.43">where you&amp;#39;re gonna buy it and that may</text>
  <text start="2634.76" dur="4.83">be because it depends we have to see</text>
  <text start="2637.4" dur="3.75">when we get there but that is highly</text>
  <text start="2639.59" dur="1.86">likely where you&amp;#39;re going to sell it</text>
  <text start="2641.15" dur="3.75">through</text>
  <text start="2641.45" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s that know your customer kind of</text>
  <text start="2644.9" dur="3.3">thing</text>
  <text start="2645.32" dur="6.78">so then it&amp;#39;s not questioned fair enough</text>
  <text start="2648.2" dur="6.69">so down a rabbit hole a little bit you</text>
  <text start="2652.1" dur="4.95">mentioned one percenters there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="2654.89" dur="4.11">idea that there are these like</text>
  <text start="2657.05" dur="3.99">Illuminati families that run the world</text>
  <text start="2659" dur="4.71">and it&amp;#39;s like you know the</text>
  <text start="2661.04" dur="5.01">fellers the the Rothschilds the Morgans</text>
  <text start="2663.71" dur="4.77">and all of those names is their merit to</text>
  <text start="2666.05" dur="4.68">that is it is it is it Illuminati</text>
  <text start="2668.48" dur="6.57">families or is it just you know a big</text>
  <text start="2670.73" dur="8.04">banker you know free-for-all well you</text>
  <text start="2675.05" dur="6.63">know my nickname is daddy gal which</text>
  <text start="2678.77" dur="6.72">basically means if I can&amp;#39;t prove it I</text>
  <text start="2681.68" dur="7.23">don&amp;#39;t say it but having said that there</text>
  <text start="2685.49" dur="7.92">is certainly a lot of historic and</text>
  <text start="2688.91" dur="6.72">ongoing pieces to this puzzle that would</text>
  <text start="2693.41" dur="5.91">make me believe that yeah they still</text>
  <text start="2695.63" dur="6.3">control a lot of these markets but they</text>
  <text start="2699.32" dur="5.82">have removed themselves and then you</text>
  <text start="2701.93" dur="7.2">have that next layer of this global</text>
  <text start="2705.14" dur="6.93">central banks that are moving all of</text>
  <text start="2709.13" dur="5.52">these strings in in perception</text>
  <text start="2712.07" dur="5.7">management terms that&amp;#39;s nudging but</text>
  <text start="2714.65" dur="5.82">again they want distance so whoever is</text>
  <text start="2717.77" dur="5.91">in charge in layers is always looking</text>
  <text start="2720.47" dur="6.26">for distance so that you do not equate</text>
  <text start="2723.68" dur="6.09">the outcome with the original</text>
  <text start="2726.73" dur="6.49">perpetrator so you avoid the pitchforks</text>
  <text start="2729.77" dur="6.48">and torches exactly exactly</text>
  <text start="2733.22" dur="6.84">but you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s interesting too</text>
  <text start="2736.25" dur="6.84">because what a JP Morgan say only gold</text>
  <text start="2740.06" dur="7.65">is money everything else is credit so</text>
  <text start="2743.09" dur="7.26">yeah he knew it but because he knew it</text>
  <text start="2747.71" dur="5.4">and understood it he also knew how to</text>
  <text start="2750.35" dur="4.74">take advantage of the system and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2753.11" dur="4.2">what bankers know how to do cuz they</text>
  <text start="2755.09" dur="4.89">write the rules and they write the way</text>
  <text start="2757.31" dur="4.74">the rules are accounted for just like</text>
  <text start="2759.98" dur="6.15">people think everything&amp;#39;s hunky-dory and</text>
  <text start="2762.05" dur="6.63">back to normal from 2008 Peck Noah the</text>
  <text start="2766.13" dur="5.82">system died I can prove that I proved it</text>
  <text start="2768.68" dur="5.67">all the time the system died that we</text>
  <text start="2771.95" dur="5.55">knew that we grew up with it died in</text>

  <text start="2787.76" dur="6.69">include you know crypto currencies of</text>
  <text start="2791.5" dur="4.39">course because the</text>
  <text start="2794.45" dur="5.34">problem that they&amp;#39;re having right now</text>
  <text start="2795.89" dur="6.15">with with physical cash resembles the</text>
  <text start="2799.79" dur="5.7">problem that they had with physical gold</text>
  <text start="2802.04" dur="5.61">in the beginning of this grand a central</text>
  <text start="2805.49" dur="4.92">bank experiment they had to take the</text>

  <text start="2812.63" dur="7.709">government in 71 Nixon took the gold</text>
  <text start="2816.65" dur="6.689">basically took the the gold away from</text>

  <text start="2843.56" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t get political because those are</text>
  <text start="2846.079" dur="4.02">not the guys that are driving this bus</text>
  <text start="2848.03" dur="5.61">those are just the guys that are</text>
  <text start="2850.099" dur="5.691">legalizing the theft it is the central</text>
  <text start="2853.64" dur="6.66">banks and the bankers and the</text>
  <text start="2855.79" dur="7.059">corporations that are driving this bus</text>
  <text start="2860.3" dur="4.74">period end of discussion and what a</text>
  <text start="2862.849" dur="4.47">bankers know they know debt and leverage</text>
  <text start="2865.04" dur="6.51">and that goes all the way back to the</text>
  <text start="2867.319" dur="6.391">consumer that have grown everybody has</text>
  <text start="2871.55" dur="3.809">the government&amp;#39;s have but the taxpayers</text>
  <text start="2873.71" dur="5.28">are responsible for that the</text>
  <text start="2875.359" dur="6.091">corporations have but the inside mean</text>
  <text start="2878.99" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s kind of complicated and convoluted</text>
  <text start="2881.45" dur="5.73">but they know debt and the whole</text>
  <text start="2883.94" dur="7.62">foundation of this entire global economy</text>
  <text start="2887.18" dur="8.46">is one based on constantly compounding</text>
  <text start="2891.56" dur="11.25">debt and interest which goes to the</text>
  <text start="2895.64" dur="8.729">flippin banks so you mentioned Nixon are</text>
  <text start="2902.81" dur="3.39">we gonna have another confiscation I</text>
  <text start="2904.369" dur="3.601">mean it sounds like that would be a very</text>
  <text start="2906.2" dur="4.53">tempting thing for them to do when this</text>
  <text start="2907.97" dur="4.8">all goes down I think so I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2910.73" dur="4.589">what even you know what happened in</text>
  <text start="2912.77" dur="4.68">India what happened in Venezuela you</text>
  <text start="2915.319" dur="3.721">know what happened and it&amp;#39;s happened</text>
  <text start="2917.45" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="2919.04" dur="8.029">different parts of the world you know as</text>
  <text start="2920.99" dur="7.27">you and I speak so I think that an overt</text>
  <text start="2927.069" dur="3.051">confiscation</text>
  <text start="2928.26" dur="7.29">is inevitable because it&amp;#39;s a market</text>
  <text start="2930.12" dur="10.34">manipulation a form of confiscation it</text>
  <text start="2935.55" dur="7.89">is thinking a form of confiscation</text>
  <text start="2940.46" dur="4.54">that&amp;#39;s true I was always kind of meaning</text>
  <text start="2943.44" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;re like precious metals are they</text>
  <text start="2945" dur="4.11">gonna come for those again and how can</text>
  <text start="2947.04" dur="5.91">we protect ourselves from that I mean</text>
  <text start="2949.11" dur="7.14">you could buy jewelry but well and then</text>
  <text start="2952.95" dur="5.52">jewelry is certainly one way you know to</text>
  <text start="2956.25" dur="5.43">do it which is why you always see me</text>
  <text start="2958.47" dur="5.37">with a lot of jewelry and even costume</text>
  <text start="2961.68" dur="6.45">jewelry cuz it&amp;#39;s physical it&amp;#39;s tangible</text>
  <text start="2963.84" dur="6.69">you know but for me personally because I</text>
  <text start="2968.13" dur="4.62">want the monetary metals and it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2970.53" dur="5.82">a much cheaper way to approach it</text>
  <text start="2972.75" dur="6.21">frankly that&amp;#39;s why I only do the</text>
  <text start="2976.35" dur="5.7">collectibles that doesn&amp;#39;t mean super</text>
  <text start="2978.96" dur="4.89">high-end collectibles because with all</text>
  <text start="2982.05" dur="4.86">of the market manipulation and the</text>
  <text start="2983.85" dur="5.55">visible market the spot market that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2986.91" dur="5.49">really driven a lot of people away from</text>
  <text start="2989.4" dur="6">the physical market so even the</text>
  <text start="2992.4" dur="6.75">collectibles I&amp;#39;m able to buy those for</text>
  <text start="2995.4" dur="7.62">what twenty-five thirty percent fifty</text>
  <text start="2999.15" dur="6.18">percent below the current true value of</text>
  <text start="3003.02" dur="4.35">an ounce of gold and even more than that</text>
  <text start="3005.33" dur="7.02">from the ounce of silver</text>
  <text start="3007.37" dur="8.22">so all flippin day long because the IRS</text>
  <text start="3012.35" dur="5.97">puts them in a different category the</text>
  <text start="3015.59" dur="6.03">one percenters that buy you can see this</text>
  <text start="3018.32" dur="4.98">in the ultra rarities index you know</text>
  <text start="3021.62" dur="3.33">these coins start at hundreds of</text>
  <text start="3023.3" dur="5.91">thousands and millions of dollars for</text>
  <text start="3024.95" dur="7.86">one ounce of gold well I kind of think</text>
  <text start="3029.21" dur="6.81">that anybody that can afford that for</text>
  <text start="3032.81" dur="7.2">one ounce of gold either I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="3036.02" dur="7.44">write the laws or hmm could influence</text>
  <text start="3040.01" dur="6.21">those that write the laws so that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="3043.46" dur="5.19">category that I want to be in and I can</text>
  <text start="3046.22" dur="4.29">do it a whole lot cheaper than a million</text>
  <text start="3048.65" dur="7.05">bucks on a coin I can do it for a couple</text>
  <text start="3050.51" dur="7.46">thousand on a coin that&amp;#39;s that I believe</text>
  <text start="3055.7" dur="4.14">that that gives me a layer of protection</text>
  <text start="3057.97" dur="3.92">that&amp;#39;s a great idea actually</text>
  <text start="3059.84" dur="5.05">um so Lynette let</text>
  <text start="3061.89" dur="5.43">what is it that says you know you and I</text>
  <text start="3064.89" dur="4.08">team trading apart from everyone else</text>
  <text start="3067.32" dur="5.52">what what makes you special what can you</text>
  <text start="3068.97" dur="7.08">offer people well I think it really is</text>
  <text start="3072.84" dur="5.88">our approach because it really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3076.05" dur="5.61">take rocket science to throw you you</text>
  <text start="3078.72" dur="6.87">know into metals but the strategy that</text>
  <text start="3081.66" dur="5.31">we utilize even though it varies from</text>
  <text start="3085.59" dur="5.93">person to person</text>
  <text start="3086.97" dur="7.11">is based upon historically repeating</text>
  <text start="3091.52" dur="5.02">patterns because even though we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3094.08" dur="7.49">guarantee the future that&amp;#39;s our best</text>
  <text start="3096.54" dur="5.03">shot I don&amp;#39;t know of anybody else that</text>
  <text start="3101.63" dur="4.93">you know certainly there are people that</text>
  <text start="3103.95" dur="4.77">understand currencies and the market is</text>
  <text start="3106.56" dur="6.95">better than I do but I don&amp;#39;t personally</text>
  <text start="3108.72" dur="9.18">know them and here we are super keen on</text>
  <text start="3113.51" dur="6.55">educated choices so when we position and</text>
  <text start="3117.9" dur="5.04">help people position into a strategy</text>
  <text start="3120.06" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s like a marriage with us you become</text>
  <text start="3122.94" dur="4.47">part of the family it&amp;#39;s not just for</text>
  <text start="3125.04" dur="4.38">buying the silver and the gold it&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="3127.41" dur="3.72">give you the ultimate tools I mean</text>
  <text start="3129.42" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s what the YouTube videos are all</text>
  <text start="3131.13" dur="6.23">about it&amp;#39;s to give you the tools to help</text>
  <text start="3134.13" dur="6.21">you be able to identify the patterns and</text>
  <text start="3137.36" dur="6.7">identify the true value the fundamental</text>
  <text start="3140.34" dur="7.47">value of any asset or instrument so that</text>
  <text start="3144.06" dur="6.03">you are clear on do I want to buy it do</text>
  <text start="3147.81" dur="4.38">I want to hold it do I want to liquidate</text>
  <text start="3150.09" dur="4.62">it what should I do now</text>
  <text start="3152.19" dur="4.62">where are we in the cycle I&amp;#39;m never</text>

  <text start="3160.62" dur="5.37">recognize that then nobody can ever pull</text>
  <text start="3164.07" dur="4.95">the wool over your eyes and I don&amp;#39;t know</text>

  <text start="3272.86" dur="6.33">have it and not need it than need it and</text>
  <text start="3274.72" dur="6.93">not have it exactly exactly because</text>
  <text start="3279.19" dur="5.07">really if you&amp;#39;re sitting on gold and</text>
  <text start="3281.65" dur="5.76">silver and you understand its true value</text>
  <text start="3284.26" dur="6.18">not the Wall Street manipulated price</text>
  <text start="3287.41" dur="4.98">what you know I always like to ask you</text>
  <text start="3290.44" dur="5.01">know what if I write and what if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3292.39" dur="5.79">wrong if you&amp;#39;re right and you&amp;#39;re sitting</text>
  <text start="3295.45" dur="6.51">in fiat money products then they will</text>
  <text start="3298.18" dur="7.62">lose their value the goal is two percent</text>
  <text start="3301.96" dur="8.1">a year okay that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3305.8" dur="8.1">right wrong they lose value BAM just</text>
  <text start="3310.06" dur="7.17">like that into hyperinflation with gold</text>
  <text start="3313.9" dur="6.99">it&amp;#39;s most important function and silver</text>
  <text start="3317.23" dur="8.13">as well is to hold your value of your</text>
  <text start="3320.89" dur="7.13">work and your labor over time so if</text>
  <text start="3325.36" dur="4.82">today they manipulated death hook</text>
  <text start="3328.02" dur="4.77">because you always have something that</text>
  <text start="3330.18" dur="5.55">has value period end of discussion</text>
  <text start="3332.79" dur="4.41">so frankly your timing could be off but</text>
  <text start="3335.73" dur="3.27">it really doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re right</text>
  <text start="3337.2" dur="3.9">or you&amp;#39;re wrong if you&amp;#39;re holding the</text>
  <text start="3339" dur="6.93">physical metals you now have something</text>
  <text start="3341.1" dur="8.42">of real value that is not predicated on</text>
  <text start="3345.93" dur="5.04">a government saying it does or does not</text>
  <text start="3349.52" dur="2.98">fair enough</text>

  <text start="3356.24" dur="4.72">halfway through this thing and we</text>
  <text start="3358.26" dur="4.29">couldn&amp;#39;t do another one absolutely this</text>
  <text start="3360.96" dur="4.409">was really fun and you ask great</text>

  <text start="3368.19" dur="3.15">found out about the Federal Reserve and</text>
  <text start="3369.93" dur="2.7">how corrupt everything was and I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="3371.34" dur="2.94">you know what I&amp;#39;m not following the</text>
  <text start="3372.63" dur="4.56">traditional path I&amp;#39;m going to go my own</text>
  <text start="3374.28" dur="5.52">route that&amp;#39;s really wonderful I wish</text>
  <text start="3377.19" dur="4.65">more people would do that that&amp;#39;s what my</text>
  <text start="3379.8" dur="3.81">work is all about should be taught in</text>
  <text start="3381.84" dur="4.23">schools but then people would make</text>
  <text start="3383.61" dur="4.62">different choices and not go along with</text>
  <text start="3386.07" dur="4.14">her plan but yeah great questions this</text>
