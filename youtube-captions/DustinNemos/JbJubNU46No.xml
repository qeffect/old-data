  <text start="1.07" dur="3.97">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="3.389" dur="4.441">most and I have some pretty exciting</text>
  <text start="5.04" dur="7.86">news for you today so I&amp;#39;ve actually got</text>
  <text start="7.83" dur="8.13">my first batch of C 60 carbon 60 coconut</text>
  <text start="12.9" dur="4.83">oil ready to go and I&amp;#39;m pretty excited</text>
  <text start="15.96" dur="4.409">it looks great I&amp;#39;ve got some really nice</text>
  <text start="17.73" dur="5.76">glass bottles some great looking labels</text>
  <text start="20.369" dur="6.061">and I think I&amp;#39;ve covered all the bases</text>
  <text start="23.49" dur="5.16">so I&amp;#39;m actually going to take this</text>
  <text start="26.43" dur="5.16">opportunity and kind of celebrate this</text>
  <text start="28.65" dur="5.76">with just a whole video about c60 so</text>
  <text start="31.59" dur="7.59">please enjoy we go welcome to the</text>
  <text start="34.41" dur="6.57">tutorial introduction overview primer or</text>
  <text start="39.18" dur="4.8">whatever you want to call it of carbon</text>
  <text start="40.98" dur="6.27">60 what is possibly one of the most</text>
  <text start="43.98" dur="6.72">interesting and dare I say miraculous</text>
  <text start="47.25" dur="5.07">products out there the the hype behind</text>
  <text start="50.7" dur="3.089">this product is that it can make you</text>
  <text start="52.32" dur="4.169">live twice as long and all of that other</text>
  <text start="53.789" dur="4.711">stuff we&amp;#39;ve all heard well let&amp;#39;s figure</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="4.05">out what the truth is and let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="4.35">through the actual science together so</text>
  <text start="60.539" dur="4.8">this is a little video I put together on</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="5.04">a program called powtoon so completely</text>
  <text start="65.339" dur="3.901">new to it not very good with it yet but</text>
  <text start="67.89" dur="2.549">let me know anything I might be able to</text>
  <text start="69.24" dur="4.739">start doing some of these kind of</text>
  <text start="70.439" dur="6.271">slideshows with that said let&amp;#39;s dive</text>
  <text start="73.979" dur="6.691">right into all of the juicy details so</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="6.449">the introduction on april 10th 2012 a</text>
  <text start="80.67" dur="5.309">study entitled the prolongation of the</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="5.761">lifespan of rats by repeated oral</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="5.28">administration of 60 fullerene was</text>
  <text start="88.92" dur="4.67">published in the highly reputed and</text>
  <text start="91.259" dur="4.741">peer-reviewed journal biomaterials</text>
  <text start="93.59" dur="5.44">according to the study by feeding rats</text>
  <text start="96" dur="5.04">carbon 60 dissolved in olive oil the</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="5.58">average life span of the subject may be</text>
  <text start="101.04" dur="6.42">increased by up to 90% in its conclusion</text>
  <text start="104.61" dur="4.619">the study states that quote C 60 should</text>
  <text start="107.46" dur="2.67">be the most efficient ever material for</text>
  <text start="109.229" dur="3.241">extending lifespan</text>
  <text start="110.13" dur="3.75">end quote in an interview the lead</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="4.8">researcher professor</text>
  <text start="113.88" dur="6.69">Fathima awsome or Moussa shraddha sada</text>
  <text start="117.27" dur="6.169">said that C 60 is quote absolutely not</text>
  <text start="120.57" dur="5.85">toxic even taking long term end quote</text>
  <text start="123.439" dur="5.141">okay no claims no medical claims this is</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="3.99">not a medical advice or anything like</text>
  <text start="128.58" dur="3.15">that just letting you know what the</text>
  <text start="130.41" dur="3.42">scientists that hit the study on the</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="4.48">rats himself is saying</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="4.69">obviously I cannot make claims about</text>
  <text start="136.21" dur="3.72">this stuff I&amp;#39;m you know all the FDA and</text>
  <text start="138.52" dur="3.42">all the regulations and all the rules I</text>
  <text start="139.93" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t want to deal with that so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="141.94" dur="2.97">gonna even try I&amp;#39;m just gonna give you</text>
  <text start="143.71" dur="2.94">the evidence and let you make up your</text>
  <text start="144.91" dur="4.2">own mind which is the best way to do it</text>
  <text start="146.65" dur="6.45">anyway so let&amp;#39;s go through a couple of</text>
  <text start="149.11" dur="6.03">quick facts about it 1 carbon atoms 60</text>
  <text start="153.1" dur="3.9">carbon atoms arranged in a spherical</text>
  <text start="155.14" dur="4.47">shape like a soccer ball it actually</text>
  <text start="157" dur="5.73">looks just like a soccer ball almost 2</text>
  <text start="159.61" dur="6.65">discovered in 1985 by a Robert curl</text>
  <text start="162.73" dur="6.09">Harold kroto and Richard Smalley 3</text>
  <text start="166.26" dur="6.49">awarded Nobel Prize for chemistry in</text>
  <text start="168.82" dur="6.33">1996 for c60 scientific study on rats to</text>
  <text start="172.75" dur="6.99">find what toxicity levels would be in</text>
  <text start="175.15" dur="6.48">humans by Abbate at AU using c 60 and</text>
  <text start="179.74" dur="4.65">olive oil resulted in some very</text>
  <text start="181.63" dur="5.88">interesting results such as no toxicity</text>
  <text start="184.39" dur="6.96">was detected increased lifespan by 2 to</text>
  <text start="187.51" dur="6.45">3 times rat livers were healthy despite</text>
  <text start="191.35" dur="6.6">being exposed to lethal doses of highly</text>
  <text start="193.96" dur="6.39">toxic and chemicals as well as after</text>
  <text start="197.95" dur="5.52">this the study kind of became well-known</text>
  <text start="200.35" dur="5.55">humans have been self testing c60 olive</text>
  <text start="203.47" dur="8.97">oil and other oils on themselves</text>
  <text start="205.9" dur="12.86">since 2012 with fascinating results next</text>
  <text start="212.44" dur="11.25">slide what theoretically can c62</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="8.17">anti aging rats 200 to 25 hundred</text>
  <text start="223.69" dur="4.44">percent increased lifespan now</text>
  <text start="226.93" dur="3.98">this isn&amp;#39;t this is important because</text>
  <text start="228.13" dur="5.4">generally speaking the study says about</text>
  <text start="230.91" dur="4.78">90% increased lifespan so people take it</text>
  <text start="233.53" dur="3.84">to me and it doubles your life however</text>
  <text start="235.69" dur="4.49">it is important to remember that they</text>
  <text start="237.37" dur="6.089">did not give this as far as I know to</text>
  <text start="240.18" dur="5.08">two baby mice and feed it to them</text>
  <text start="243.459" dur="3.661">throughout their entire lifetime</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="5.67">I think the gate already gave it to</text>
  <text start="247.12" dur="5.61">adult mice so if theoretically they had</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="4.02">done that from birth how much longer</text>
  <text start="252.73" dur="4.65">might the same rat have lived if they</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="5.849">had benefitted from that same effect for</text>
  <text start="257.38" dur="4.5">a much longer period of time and yes of</text>
  <text start="260.799" dur="2.701">course there was all of the organ</text>
  <text start="261.88" dur="3.06">rejuvenation and stuff in these older</text>
  <text start="263.5" dur="2.97">animals but would they have decayed in</text>
  <text start="264.94" dur="4.05">the first place nearly as bad</text>
  <text start="266.47" dur="4.71">right maybe it&amp;#39;s better and more</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="4.17">effective if you can get it at a younger</text>
  <text start="271.18" dur="5.16">age and preserve rather than try to</text>
  <text start="273.16" dur="7.02">repair prevention is worth an ounce of</text>
  <text start="276.34" dur="6.06">cure as they say so this is just a</text>
  <text start="280.18" dur="3.78">little bit of conjecture on my part and</text>
  <text start="282.4" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;ve read some things from other people</text>
  <text start="283.96" dur="5.67">that suggest it as much as well it could</text>
  <text start="287.14" dur="4.98">also go up to 25 times maybe not just</text>
  <text start="289.63" dur="5.31">two times just in theory completely</text>
  <text start="292.12" dur="4.92">conjecture the rest of this is hard</text>
  <text start="294.94" dur="4.32">science that we&amp;#39;ve that we&amp;#39;ve got but</text>
  <text start="297.04" dur="5.1">this is just conjecture based on kind of</text>
  <text start="299.26" dur="6.06">what we know mm-hmm it wouldn&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="302.14" dur="6.18">be tested for sure maintains in the</text>
  <text start="305.32" dur="6.48">lipid bilayers and the mitochondria of</text>
  <text start="308.32" dur="6.29">cells so it stays in the cells possibly</text>
  <text start="311.8" dur="5.25">for months giving protective shielding</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="4.96">rejuvenation of organisms on a cellular</text>
  <text start="317.05" dur="6.21">level protection against methyl groups</text>
  <text start="319.57" dur="6">that degrade and neutralize DNA stopped</text>
  <text start="323.26" dur="3.87">telomeres shortening okay this</text>
  <text start="325.57" dur="3.63">potentially stops or slows the aging</text>
  <text start="327.13" dur="3.539">process your telomeres are you&amp;#39;re aging</text>
  <text start="329.2" dur="3.69">all right and the shorter they get the</text>
  <text start="330.669" dur="4.021">older you get or the older you get the</text>
  <text start="332.89" dur="3.99">shorter they get there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="334.69" dur="3.87">still to be known and studied and</text>
  <text start="336.88" dur="3.12">learned about telomeres but anything</text>
  <text start="338.56" dur="5.45">that can lengthen them or stop the</text>
  <text start="340" dur="6.99">shortening process could freeze aging</text>
  <text start="344.01" dur="6.07">buckminsterfullerene or buckyballs or</text>
  <text start="346.99" dur="4.8">just commonly known as c60 is a powerful</text>
  <text start="350.08" dur="3.08">antioxidant that has effects on</text>
  <text start="351.79" dur="5.07">unsaturated fats</text>
  <text start="353.16" dur="6.24">c16 removes superoxide which is a toxic</text>
  <text start="356.86" dur="4.71">byproduct of cellular metabolism that</text>
  <text start="359.4" dur="3.67">contributes to tissue injury in many</text>
  <text start="361.57" dur="3.42">human diseases now cellular metabolism</text>
  <text start="363.07" dur="3.72">that means your cells just breathing and</text>
  <text start="364.99" dur="3.54">eating and living and doing their normal</text>
  <text start="366.79" dur="9.48">everyday thing so this stuff is</text>
  <text start="368.53" dur="10.4">everywhere and where was I Rosa a review</text>
  <text start="376.27" dur="5.76">of scientific research has shown that</text>
  <text start="378.93" dur="5.29">c60 has longevity and antioxidant</text>
  <text start="382.03" dur="4.35">effects given as scavenging capacity for</text>
  <text start="384.22" dur="3.48">reactive oxygen species and yeah this</text>
  <text start="386.38" dur="3.27">stuff&amp;#39;s like 300 times stronger than</text>
  <text start="387.7" dur="4.89">vitamin C as an antioxidant so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="389.65" dur="5.88">very good at that</text>
  <text start="392.59" dur="4.919">and continuing on some think that by</text>
  <text start="395.53" dur="3.81">absorbing their by acid c60 is then</text>
  <text start="397.509" dur="5.13">attracted to the mitochondria and</text>
  <text start="399.34" dur="5.46">carries the protons superoxide acceptors</text>
  <text start="402.639" dur="4.191">to prevent the very source of damage</text>
  <text start="404.8" dur="4.83">from the electron transport chain</text>
  <text start="406.83" dur="5.679">basically there&amp;#39;s a lot of little</text>
  <text start="409.63" dur="4.62">electrical electrochemical reactions</text>
  <text start="412.509" dur="3.421">going on in your body at all times and</text>
  <text start="414.25" dur="3.27">some of them are pretty bad some things</text>
  <text start="415.93" dur="3.69">that get in there to start pulling</text>
  <text start="417.52" dur="4.38">things from other other places that it</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="4.049">shouldn&amp;#39;t or start depositing things and</text>
  <text start="421.9" dur="3.66">other places that it shouldn&amp;#39;t and that</text>
  <text start="423.669" dur="4.53">might just be an electron here or a</text>
  <text start="425.56" dur="4.77">proton there but it really can I can</text>
  <text start="428.199" dur="4.051">mess things up you know a one extra</text>
  <text start="430.33" dur="4.05">Neutron here or there could turn</text>
  <text start="432.25" dur="3.99">something that&amp;#39;s like a vitamin into</text>
  <text start="434.38" dur="4.71">something that&amp;#39;s more like a poison so</text>
  <text start="436.24" dur="4.98">you never know exactly what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="439.09" dur="4.799">in there that&amp;#39;s why you really really</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="5.55">should focus on you know just my thought</text>
  <text start="443.889" dur="4.291">and opinion on the homeopathic side of</text>
  <text start="446.77" dur="4.8">things because it really treats your</text>
  <text start="448.18" dur="5.37">body a plant as a medicine treat your</text>
  <text start="451.57" dur="5.61">body in a thousand ways whereas a</text>
  <text start="453.55" dur="6.36">isolated drug of some sort that is</text>
  <text start="457.18" dur="5.13">focused on one thing is gonna have a</text>
  <text start="459.91" dur="5.759">thousand unknown reactions or side</text>
  <text start="462.31" dur="5.46">effects or unpredicted results because</text>
  <text start="465.669" dur="5.131">it&amp;#39;s not natural and we&amp;#39;re not designed</text>
  <text start="467.77" dur="3.75">to handle that but that&amp;#39;s a video for</text>
  <text start="470.8" dur="5.31">another day</text>
  <text start="471.52" dur="7.079">and the let&amp;#39;s see the proposed mechanism</text>
  <text start="476.11" dur="4.799">indicates that c60 has the ability to</text>
  <text start="478.599" dur="4.471">acquire positive charge by absorbing</text>
  <text start="480.909" dur="4.771">protons which positively charged</text>
  <text start="483.07" dur="4.71">hydrogen atoms and this complex should</text>
  <text start="485.68" dur="4.35">enter into the mitochondria leading to a</text>
  <text start="487.78" dur="6.59">decrease in reactive oxygen species</text>
  <text start="490.03" dur="8.25">production lots of big words in there</text>
  <text start="494.37" dur="5.59">computer simulations have shown that c60</text>
  <text start="498.28" dur="3.93">has the ability to pass through lipid</text>
  <text start="499.96" dur="5.63">membranes enter the cell and then alter</text>
  <text start="502.21" dur="6.959">its functions in a good way obviously</text>
  <text start="505.59" dur="5.74">super antioxidant like I mentioned far</text>
  <text start="509.169" dur="5.55">far far more powerful than you know kind</text>
  <text start="511.33" dur="6.149">of your standard in that if you&amp;#39;re into</text>
  <text start="514.719" dur="5.82">anything other than allopathic you know</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="4.35">drugs and poisons and cut burned and</text>
  <text start="520.539" dur="2.701">poison which is basically what</text>
  <text start="521.829" dur="3.371">allopathic medicine is about these days</text>
  <text start="523.24" dur="4.27">if you&amp;#39;re in anything</text>
  <text start="525.2" dur="4.56">a natural homeopathic kind of a standard</text>
  <text start="527.51" dur="4.41">product is vitamin C right it&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="529.76" dur="5.19">the most commonly known and accepted</text>
  <text start="531.92" dur="5.25">ones as well and then has tons of</text>
  <text start="534.95" dur="4.38">research on it I think you can even</text>
  <text start="537.17" dur="3.36">legally make claims about vitamin C I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="539.33" dur="3.33">not sure because there&amp;#39;s just so much</text>
  <text start="540.53" dur="4.56">research about how and it however that</text>
  <text start="542.66" dur="5.16">said this stuff is like I said over 300</text>
  <text start="545.09" dur="5.16">times stronger so just keep that in mind</text>
  <text start="547.82" dur="4.74">and as I&amp;#39;m about to say here it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="550.25" dur="4.86">catalytic radical scavenger it can</text>
  <text start="552.56" dur="4.77">recycle and repeat its activity over and</text>
  <text start="555.11" dur="4.83">over so it is not used up in the process</text>
  <text start="557.33" dur="4.02">of its cleaning action just you know and</text>
  <text start="559.94" dur="3.78">I think like a vitamin C or something</text>
  <text start="561.35" dur="4.65">would go through some sort of chemical</text>
  <text start="563.72" dur="4.29">reaction where you know it would it</text>
  <text start="566" dur="4.56">would it would be used up in the process</text>
  <text start="568.01" dur="4.26">of the healing and even if it didn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="570.56" dur="3.99">won&amp;#39;t stay in your body but for so long</text>
  <text start="572.27" dur="3.78">and then that will you know get kicked</text>
  <text start="574.55" dur="3.63">out whereas this stuff can stay in your</text>
  <text start="576.05" dur="4.23">cells for months like I said it gets</text>
  <text start="578.18" dur="4.23">kind of it&amp;#39;s just the right size to get</text>
  <text start="580.28" dur="5.25">in all the best places that it can do</text>
  <text start="582.41" dur="5.52">the best good and accepting and donating</text>
  <text start="585.53" dur="5.13">an electron it can protect your liver</text>
  <text start="587.93" dur="3.87">from harmful toxins it can cross the</text>
  <text start="590.66" dur="3.3">blood-brain barrier</text>
  <text start="591.8" dur="4.35">it has anti-cancer properties positive</text>
  <text start="593.96" dur="4.35">outcomes in memory and aging and its</text>
  <text start="596.15" dur="4.98">antiviral inhibits the build-up of</text>
  <text start="598.31" dur="4.71">arterial plaque prevents amyloid peptide</text>
  <text start="601.13" dur="5.19">induced cytotoxicity which is</text>
  <text start="603.02" dur="6">Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease and it extends the</text>
  <text start="606.32" dur="5.64">life of rats by 90% some claim it would</text>
  <text start="609.02" dur="4.8">be twenty five hundred percent or twenty</text>
  <text start="611.96" dur="4.44">five times if the rats have been fed</text>
  <text start="613.82" dur="4.53">from birth you know I&amp;#39;m not making this</text>
  <text start="616.4" dur="3.36">up I&amp;#39;ve read this when I was going</text>
  <text start="618.35" dur="4.53">through all the different research and</text>

  <text start="1914.1" dur="5.49">looking at this okay so C 60 is an</text>

  <text start="1921.3" dur="5.31">you can take a lot of it so how much do</text>
  <text start="1925.41" dur="2.94">you need to get the health effects</text>
  <text start="1926.61" dur="4.68">probably a lot less than it would take</text>
