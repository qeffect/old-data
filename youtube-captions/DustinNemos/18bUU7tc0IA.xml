  <text start="110.659" dur="4.771">your support for them because they show</text>
  <text start="112.789" dur="4.951">their support for us our first story</text>
  <text start="115.43" dur="4.439">comes out of Sunshine State news gun law</text>
  <text start="117.74" dur="3.449">struck down judge sides with local</text>
  <text start="119.869" dur="4.29">governments so this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="121.189" dur="5.371">Florida a Leon County Circuit Judge late</text>
  <text start="124.159" dur="4.801">on Friday struck down a state law that</text>
  <text start="126.56" dur="3.75">threatend tough penalties if city and</text>
  <text start="128.96" dur="4.89">county officials approved gun</text>
  <text start="130.31" dur="5.4">regulations so since 1987 Florida has</text>
  <text start="133.85" dur="4.08">barred cities from passing regulations</text>
  <text start="135.71" dur="5.13">that are stricter than state regulations</text>
  <text start="137.93" dur="6.45">known as the preemption law however in</text>
  <text start="140.84" dur="7.2">2011 lawmakers approved penalties</text>
  <text start="144.38" dur="6.84">against officials who passed regulations</text>
  <text start="148.04" dur="6.199">that were stricter so for example they</text>
  <text start="151.22" dur="4.59">could be fine anywhere from $5,000 to</text>
  <text start="154.239" dur="3.911">$100,000 and</text>
  <text start="155.81" dur="6.06">they could be removed from office so</text>
  <text start="158.15" dur="6.78">this law has deterred anyone from</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="6.93">violating the original 1987 preemption</text>
  <text start="164.93" dur="5.97">law however local governments had</text>
  <text start="168.8" dur="3.48">challenged this law after the mass</text>
  <text start="170.9" dur="4.83">shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas</text>
  <text start="172.28" dur="5.64">high in parkland now three lawsuits and</text>
  <text start="175.73" dur="4.95">30 cities were involved in this ruling</text>
  <text start="177.92" dur="4.74">and so of course it&amp;#39;s likely that Judge</text>
  <text start="180.68" dur="4.47">Charles Dawson was under oath</text>
  <text start="182.66" dur="5.22">considerable amount of pressure from</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="6.45">these local law makers in order to</text>
  <text start="187.88" dur="6.21">declare the 2011 law unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="191.6" dur="4.38">now state representative Dan Daly who is</text>
  <text start="194.09" dur="4.59">a coral springs Democrat he had</text>
  <text start="195.98" dur="5.55">originally challenged this 2011 law back</text>
  <text start="198.68" dur="4.86">when he was a city official so he has</text>
  <text start="201.53" dur="4.23">come out making a statement that this is</text>
  <text start="203.54" dur="4.559">a major step in the right direction of</text>
  <text start="205.76" dur="4.92">course for what he calls safer</text>
  <text start="208.099" dur="5.731">communities now I would argue that</text>
  <text start="210.68" dur="6.3">stricter gun laws do not make safer</text>
  <text start="213.83" dur="5.82">communities and if they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="216.98" dur="6.74">the parkland shooting as justification</text>
  <text start="219.65" dur="7.11">for stricter gun laws it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="223.72" dur="5.29">mass shootings at schools actually does</text>
  <text start="226.76" dur="5.22">the opposite because it demonstrates</text>
  <text start="229.01" dur="6.059">that a law because again it is against</text>
  <text start="231.98" dur="6">the law to carry a gun in a gun-free</text>
  <text start="235.069" dur="4.681">zone schools are gun-free zones so if</text>
  <text start="237.98" dur="4.08">you have a law that says you can&amp;#39;t carry</text>
  <text start="239.75" dur="4.14">a gun and it doesn&amp;#39;t prevent mass</text>
  <text start="242.06" dur="7.95">shootings then there is something wrong</text>
  <text start="243.89" dur="10.56">with this logic stricter gun laws are</text>
  <text start="250.01" dur="8.129">not the solution it&amp;#39;s not going to help</text>
  <text start="254.45" dur="5.52">all that it does is make those who are</text>
  <text start="258.139" dur="5.9">at these gun-free zones innocent</text>
  <text start="259.97" dur="7.169">bystanders they now become sitting ducks</text>
  <text start="264.039" dur="5.311">because the only people who will have</text>
  <text start="267.139" dur="4.171">guns in these gun-free zones are</text>
  <text start="269.35" dur="4.39">criminals people who don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="271.31" dur="5.25">the law so no matter how many gun laws</text>
  <text start="273.74" dur="6.06">you make the criminals those who are</text>
  <text start="276.56" dur="6.419">mostly responsible for violent gun</text>
  <text start="279.8" dur="4.739">crimes they are going to totally</text>
  <text start="282.979" dur="2.761">disregard the law because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="284.539" dur="2.141">care about it that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="285.74" dur="8.62">criminals</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="10.62">criminals don&amp;#39;t care about laws so using</text>
  <text start="294.36" dur="7.8">mass shootings at schools and churches</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="8.6">as a justification makes no sense now of</text>
  <text start="302.16" dur="7.47">course governor Ron de santis he opposes</text>
  <text start="305.9" dur="5.41">the overturn of this law and his lawyers</text>
  <text start="309.63" dur="2.099">who were there as well as Attorney</text>
  <text start="311.31" dur="3.63">General</text>
  <text start="311.729" dur="5.901">Ashley Mooney and the NRA had argued</text>
  <text start="314.94" dur="5.52">that the 2011 law should be upheld</text>
  <text start="317.63" dur="7.45">because the reason why it was in place</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="9.329">was to prevent the abuse of the</text>
  <text start="325.08" dur="8.04">preemption law the 1987 law because</text>
  <text start="329.789" dur="6.721">here&amp;#39;s the thing the preemption law was</text>
  <text start="333.12" dur="6">there and it stated that you local</text>
  <text start="336.51" dur="7.11">officials cities and counties were not</text>
  <text start="339.12" dur="9.57">allowed to enforce gun regulations that</text>
  <text start="343.62" dur="8.43">were stricter than the state but there</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="6.509">were no penalties if they violated it so</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="11.07">if there&amp;#39;s no penalties for violating a</text>
  <text start="355.199" dur="11.611">law then there&amp;#39;s no deterrent there so</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="8.03">the 2011 law is necessary to prevent</text>
  <text start="366.81" dur="9.169">people from overstepping because really</text>
  <text start="371.15" dur="8.53">the state should have authority over</text>
  <text start="375.979" dur="5.41">local governments that&amp;#39;s the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="4.769">supposed to work just like the federal</text>
  <text start="381.389" dur="5.551">government has authority over state</text>
  <text start="384.449" dur="8.551">governments state governments has the</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="9.42">authority over local so then and also</text>
  <text start="393" dur="6.24">here&amp;#39;s the thing you can&amp;#39;t have cities</text>
  <text start="396.36" dur="6">and counties making up their own rules</text>
  <text start="399.24" dur="8.34">as far as gun regulations because then</text>
  <text start="402.36" dur="8.339">it causes patchwork laws so then</text>
  <text start="407.58" dur="5.22">somebody who has a gun moves from one</text>
  <text start="410.699" dur="4.051">County to the next all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="412.8" dur="5.609">they&amp;#39;re breaking the law and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="414.75" dur="4.169">even know it this is not right it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="418.409" dur="0.991">okay</text>
  <text start="418.919" dur="4.051">you</text>
  <text start="419.4" dur="5.43">not have different regulations between</text>
  <text start="422.97" dur="8.13">cities and counties like that especially</text>
  <text start="424.83" dur="10.14">when it comes to gun ownership so you</text>
  <text start="431.1" dur="9.569">know they somehow they need to move this</text>
  <text start="434.97" dur="8.729">to the Supreme Court to challenge it we</text>
  <text start="440.669" dur="6.571">need to have the penalties in place so</text>
  <text start="443.699" dur="9.351">that people don&amp;#39;t abuse the 1987</text>
  <text start="447.24" dur="8.28">preemption law all right in other news</text>
  <text start="453.05" dur="4.3">Georgia election officials accused of</text>
  <text start="455.52" dur="4.44">destroying evidence so there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="457.35" dur="4.98">lot of talk about you know whether or</text>
  <text start="459.96" dur="4.26">not we&amp;#39;re addressing the voter fraud</text>
  <text start="462.33" dur="4.35">that had happened during the midterms it</text>
  <text start="464.22" dur="5.34">was so blatantly obvious there was a lot</text>
  <text start="466.68" dur="4.89">of evidence that was even on mainstream</text>
  <text start="469.56" dur="7.71">media where they were talking about this</text>
  <text start="471.57" dur="7.319">where there was election fraud so it was</text>
  <text start="477.27" dur="3.239">briefly in the news and then it went</text>
  <text start="478.889" dur="3.541">away and so a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="480.509" dur="4.44">complaining that they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="482.43" dur="5.25">anything about holding those who</text>
  <text start="484.949" dur="4.171">violated the election laws those who</text>
  <text start="487.68" dur="4.739">violated the law they&amp;#39;re not being held</text>
  <text start="489.12" dur="9.32">accountable and so the concern here is</text>
  <text start="492.419" dur="10.951">that this will make the 2020 election</text>
  <text start="498.44" dur="8.469">vulnerable to the same frauds well it</text>
  <text start="503.37" dur="7.229">appears that there are things being done</text>
  <text start="506.909" dur="7.981">in the background so right now there is</text>
  <text start="510.599" dur="8.161">an investigation going on into whether</text>
  <text start="514.89" dur="8.1">or not Georgia officials had destroyed</text>
  <text start="518.76" dur="8.22">evidence and this resulted from a</text>
  <text start="522.99" dur="7.41">lawsuit that was initiated by local</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="5.91">election integrity advocates as well as</text>
  <text start="530.4" dur="3.75">Georgia voters themselves so they had</text>
  <text start="532.89" dur="3.81">brought a lawsuit and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.15" dur="4.29">looking into whether or not Georgia</text>
  <text start="536.7" dur="4.2">state officials destroyed evidence</text>
  <text start="538.44" dur="4.46">because the original complaint had said</text>
  <text start="540.9" dur="4.77">that you know they needed to get rid of</text>
  <text start="542.9" dur="4.98">the outdated machines that they were</text>
  <text start="545.67" dur="5.69">using and they needed to go</text>
  <text start="547.88" dur="7.079">paper ballots well as soon as they final</text>
  <text start="551.36" dur="6.74">this lawsuit then state officials</text>
  <text start="554.959" dur="5.25">started destroying evidence and</text>
  <text start="558.1" dur="7.359">continued to do so throughout the</text>
  <text start="560.209" dur="8.721">lawsuit so and they had even said that</text>
  <text start="565.459" dur="6.781">when it came to the computer servers</text>
  <text start="568.93" dur="6.06">they were destroying the servers they</text>
  <text start="572.24" dur="2.75">were wiping them clean</text>
  <text start="575.38" dur="5.11">so they also accused state officials and</text>
  <text start="579.259" dur="3.63">their lawyers of deleting and</text>
  <text start="580.49" dur="4.26">overwriting data preserved on voting</text>
  <text start="582.889" dur="3.601">machine memories and on memory Karns</text>
  <text start="584.75" dur="4.41">used to program the voting machine and</text>
  <text start="586.49" dur="3.899">they said quote after abundant notice of</text>
  <text start="589.16" dur="3.03">their well-known duty to preserve</text>
  <text start="590.389" dur="4.38">evidence the state defendants did not</text>
  <text start="592.19" dur="4.25">simply neglect to disable some automated</text>
  <text start="594.769" dur="4.201">purge function in their IT systems</text>
  <text start="596.44" dur="4.42">rather they intentionally and</text>
  <text start="598.97" dur="5.07">calculatingly destroyed evidence and</text>
  <text start="600.86" dur="5.94">quote then they continued surely to</text>
  <text start="604.04" dur="4.71">engage in conduct so obvious that any</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="3.57">junior lawyer would know it would expose</text>
  <text start="608.75" dur="3.72">them to sanctions the evidence so</text>
  <text start="610.37" dur="5.639">disposed of must have been damning in</text>
  <text start="612.47" dur="5.4">the extreme and of course secretary of</text>
  <text start="616.009" dur="4.56">state officials spokeswoman Tess hammock</text>
  <text start="617.87" dur="4.56">has denied these allegations and said</text>
  <text start="620.569" dur="3.781">quote we look forward to vigorously</text>
  <text start="622.43" dur="3.93">defending ourselves from these spurious</text>
  <text start="624.35" dur="3.63">allegations meant to distract the court</text>
  <text start="626.36" dur="3.719">from the fact that there is no evidence</text>
  <text start="627.98" dur="5.58">that supports plaintiffs outlandish</text>
  <text start="630.079" dur="6.421">theories and quote of course allegations</text>
  <text start="633.56" dur="4.949">of destruction of evidence doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="636.5" dur="3.6">really come as a surprise especially</text>
  <text start="638.509" dur="4.341">since Georgia had made national</text>
  <text start="640.1" dur="5.789">headlines when Stacey Abrams was</text>
  <text start="642.85" dur="6.159">narrowly defeated by Brian Kemp in last</text>
  <text start="645.889" dur="5.851">year&amp;#39;s midterms and of course at this</text>
  <text start="649.009" dur="5.281">point Stacey Abrams is still screaming</text>
  <text start="651.74" dur="4.949">that the election was stolen from her</text>
  <text start="654.29" dur="4.89">even to this day which is no surprise</text>
  <text start="656.689" dur="4.801">scenes out just like Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="659.18" dur="7.44">she&amp;#39;s mad and confused over the fact</text>
  <text start="661.49" dur="7.74">that she lost a rigged election now of</text>
  <text start="666.62" dur="5.069">course George is saying now that a new</text>
  <text start="669.23" dur="3.959">system should be in place by 2020 so</text>
  <text start="671.689" dur="4.861">let&amp;#39;s hope that that&amp;#39;s the case because</text>
  <text start="673.189" dur="4.59">we cannot afford for any election to be</text>

  <text start="677.779" dur="3.801">in other news Trump says he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1147.9" dur="3.51">of course this was done very quietly</text>
  <text start="1149.67" dur="5.57">because it did not make headlines</text>
  <text start="1151.41" dur="7.5">whatsoever so last month Andrew Cuomo</text>
  <text start="1155.24" dur="8.38">had killed the religious exemption in</text>
  <text start="1158.91" dur="7.07">New York State for vaccinations and also</text>
  <text start="1163.62" dur="4.92">not only did he get rid of this</text>
  <text start="1165.98" dur="5.11">religious exemption because there are</text>
  <text start="1168.54" dur="3">families that you know they don&amp;#39;t get a</text>
  <text start="1171.09" dur="2.64">VAX</text>
  <text start="1171.54" dur="5.58">vaccines because it goes against their</text>
  <text start="1173.73" dur="6.18">religious beliefs and practices there</text>
  <text start="1177.12" dur="5.07">was a protection for that because again</text>
  <text start="1179.91" dur="5.22">this is a right granted by the</text>
  <text start="1182.19" dur="6.63">Constitution also it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s an issue</text>
  <text start="1185.13" dur="5.61">of separation of church and state but</text>
  <text start="1188.82" dur="6.36">now Andrew Cuomo has killed that</text>
  <text start="1190.74" dur="7.2">exemption and it not only applies to</text>
  <text start="1195.18" dur="4.77">public schools but now he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="1197.94" dur="3.99">a child who&amp;#39;s not vaccinated cannot</text>
  <text start="1199.95" dur="5.24">attend either a public school or a</text>
  <text start="1201.93" dur="3.26">private school</text>
  <text start="1205.29" dur="6.82">which is unheard of his public schools</text>
  <text start="1210.19" dur="3.42">are those that are sanctioned by the</text>
  <text start="1212.11" dur="5.7">government whereas private schools are</text>
  <text start="1213.61" dur="6.6">not and yet this law is saying that a</text>

  <text start="1220.21" dur="7.08">unless they are vaccinated</text>
  <text start="1222.36" dur="6.46">so now 23,000 families are affected by</text>
  <text start="1227.29" dur="4.32">this and their children are not able to</text>
  <text start="1228.82" dur="5.4">go to school so 55 of those families are</text>
  <text start="1231.61" dur="8.12">taking the state to court and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1234.22" dur="5.51">suing because this violates their rights</text>
  <text start="1241.38" dur="7.78">so whatever side of the vaccination</text>
  <text start="1246.01" dur="4.92">argument you&amp;#39;re on this is a violation</text>
  <text start="1249.16" dur="4.47">of constitutional rights when it comes</text>
  <text start="1250.93" dur="4.92">to religious exemptions in other news</text>
  <text start="1253.63" dur="6.24">now I don&amp;#39;t want to cover these two</text>
  <text start="1255.85" dur="9.78">stories too much because here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1259.87" dur="8.13">thing these two events these shootings</text>
  <text start="1265.63" dur="6.81">that happened one in New York one in</text>
  <text start="1268" dur="10.1">California I&amp;#39;m of the opinion that these</text>
  <text start="1272.44" dur="8.52">are part of an agenda a gun control push</text>
  <text start="1278.1" dur="4.84">by creating fear now you can tell me</text>
  <text start="1280.96" dur="5.19">what you think in the comments below but</text>
  <text start="1282.94" dur="8.31">I&amp;#39;m just going to say that that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="1286.15" dur="9.72">think this is because the timing is</text>
  <text start="1291.25" dur="6.87">quite coincidental and also there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1295.87" dur="4.68">no rhyme or reason to either of these</text>
  <text start="1298.12" dur="4.71">shootings so the first one happened in</text>

  <text start="1325.3" dur="4.29">they have an arrest and anybody there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1326.92" dur="7.19">no motive as to why someone would come</text>

  <text start="1345.049" dur="10.411">somebody had jumped the fence and went</text>

  <text start="1355.58" dur="6.9">no rhyme or reason and of course mind</text>
  <text start="1359.34" dur="6.059">you this is an event where weapons are</text>
  <text start="1362.48" dur="6.399">not allowed so this is a gun-free zone</text>

  <text start="1572.34" dur="4.83">make it seem like the only way that we</text>
  <text start="1575.4" dur="4.98">are going to be safe from these types of</text>
  <text start="1577.17" dur="6.54">shootings is to disarm us for us to give</text>
  <text start="1580.38" dur="6.09">up our guns just like in other places</text>
  <text start="1583.71" dur="4.74">like New Zealand for example where there</text>
  <text start="1586.47" dur="3.75">were a significant number of people who</text>
  <text start="1588.45" dur="7.65">decided to hand over their guns because</text>
  <text start="1590.22" dur="9.57">of a shooting at Churchill so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1596.1" dur="5.79">just my analysis of the situation but</text>
  <text start="1599.79" dur="5.04">you know our hearts and prayers go out</text>
  <text start="1601.89" dur="8.07">to the people California and New York</text>
  <text start="1604.83" dur="8.04">and their families because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1609.96" dur="6.06">tragedy okay</text>
  <text start="1612.87" dur="5.82">other news Trump announces John</text>
  <text start="1616.02" dur="4.67">Ratcliffe as the nominee for the new</text>
  <text start="1618.69" dur="5.27">Director of National Intelligence</text>
  <text start="1620.69" dur="7.24">because of course dan coates is leaving</text>
  <text start="1623.96" dur="4.75">now I think that this is a perfect</text>
  <text start="1627.93" dur="5.13">replacement</text>
  <text start="1628.71" dur="5.849">so John Ratcliffe he is going to clean</text>
  <text start="1633.06" dur="5.729">house</text>
  <text start="1634.559" dur="7.771">if he is the director of intelligence he</text>
  <text start="1638.789" dur="7.171">is going to clean house now of course he</text>
  <text start="1642.33" dur="5.16">demonstrated his knowledge not only his</text>
  <text start="1645.96" dur="5.37">knowledge of the law but his dedication</text>
  <text start="1647.49" dur="10.649">to it most recently at the Muller</text>
  <text start="1651.33" dur="12.709">testimony where he had explained the law</text>
  <text start="1658.139" dur="10.071">and how obstruction of justice their</text>
  <text start="1664.039" dur="9.301">inclusion of it in the report was</text>
  <text start="1668.21" dur="7.299">unnecessary unethical and likely illegal</text>
  <text start="1673.34" dur="7.059">because that&amp;#39;s not the law there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1675.509" dur="8.28">presumption of innocence he also is very</text>
  <text start="1680.399" dur="4.77">aware that there are those within the</text>

  <text start="1690.36" dur="8.61">coup attempt to overthrow Trump and he</text>
  <text start="1697.409" dur="5.61">had actually recently made a statement</text>
  <text start="1698.97" dur="7.439">where he said that Attorney General</text>
  <text start="1703.019" dur="6.841">William bar will definitely see to those</text>
  <text start="1706.409" dur="7.26">who were guilty of this they are going</text>
  <text start="1709.86" dur="7.5">to be held accountable and it&amp;#39;s likely</text>
  <text start="1713.669" dur="6.75">that Obama administration is going to</text>
  <text start="1717.36" dur="5.429">include Obama himself because Obama was</text>
  <text start="1720.419" dur="6.09">the one who gave the orders and the</text>
  <text start="1722.789" dur="8.73">go-ahead in the first place but even</text>
  <text start="1726.509" dur="12.951">beyond just the roundup of those who are</text>
  <text start="1731.519" dur="11.1">guilty in the attempted q rackleff is an</text>
  <text start="1739.46" dur="6.039">excellent pick for the Director of</text>
