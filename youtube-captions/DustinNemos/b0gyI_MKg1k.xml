  <text start="110.899" dur="5.521">your support for them because they show</text>
  <text start="113.03" dur="6.93">their support for us so yesterday</text>
  <text start="116.42" dur="9.33">Moeller was pulled before the Judiciary</text>
  <text start="119.96" dur="7.92">Committee to testify on something that</text>
  <text start="125.75" dur="4.77">he has already written a full report on</text>
  <text start="127.88" dur="6.09">the report that was made largely public</text>
  <text start="130.52" dur="6.17">with the exception of material that has</text>
  <text start="133.97" dur="5.19">to do with grand jury proceedings as</text>
  <text start="136.69" dur="4.15">well as other material that needs to be</text>
  <text start="139.16" dur="6.24">kept confidential</text>
  <text start="140.84" dur="9.27">now also prior to this testimony</text>
  <text start="145.4" dur="7.11">yesterday certain House members the ones</text>
  <text start="150.11" dur="4.6">of course who were complaining so much</text>
  <text start="152.51" dur="5.32">about this report</text>
  <text start="154.71" dur="5.97">had not even read the report and they</text>
  <text start="157.83" dur="6.66">admitted this not long before the</text>
  <text start="160.68" dur="6.87">testimony so what this really was was</text>
  <text start="164.49" dur="6">that the Democrats were not satisfied</text>
  <text start="167.55" dur="5.34">with the outcome of the report because</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="5.7">really this was supposed to be the basis</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="7.98">for the initiation of impeachment</text>
  <text start="176.19" dur="6.84">proceedings so because the report</text>
  <text start="180.87" dur="5.43">obviously did not result in that then</text>
  <text start="183.03" dur="6.24">they needed to have further testimony</text>
  <text start="186.3" dur="5.61">from Muller in order to try to persuade</text>
  <text start="189.27" dur="4.56">the public opinion because then if they</text>
  <text start="191.91" dur="4.65">can persuade the public opinion towards</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="7.62">impeachment then they can really push</text>
  <text start="196.56" dur="9.81">for impeachment however once again that</text>
  <text start="201.45" dur="7.92">did not occur now there were a couple of</text>
  <text start="206.37" dur="5.85">really important takeaways from the</text>
  <text start="209.37" dur="5.22">Moller testimony that some people</text>
  <text start="212.22" dur="7.71">actually most are not talking about</text>
  <text start="214.59" dur="7.95">right now so largely what the narrative</text>
  <text start="219.93" dur="4.56">is right now regarding that testimony is</text>
  <text start="222.54" dur="5.16">of course on the mainstream media side</text>
  <text start="224.49" dur="5.88">that wants to push the whole anti-trump</text>
  <text start="227.7" dur="4.53">you know Russia collusion narrative</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re really focusing on the</text>
  <text start="232.23" dur="5.01">obstruction of justice and whether or</text>
  <text start="235.35" dur="6.24">not obstruction of justice had occurred</text>
  <text start="237.24" dur="8.82">and whether or not that then should lead</text>
  <text start="241.59" dur="8.49">to impeachment proceedings or an</text>
  <text start="246.06" dur="6.66">indictment later on the other thing</text>
  <text start="250.08" dur="7.5">that&amp;#39;s being pushed out right now is the</text>
  <text start="252.72" dur="7.17">focus on Muller and his presentation how</text>
  <text start="257.58" dur="4.37">he was fumbling his words how he</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="4.44">couldn&amp;#39;t remember things how he</text>
  <text start="261.95" dur="5.26">continually had to refer back to his</text>
  <text start="264.33" dur="5.52">notes how he refused to answer questions</text>
  <text start="267.21" dur="5.91">how he was visibly shaking he was</text>
  <text start="269.85" dur="5.85">obviously very nervous now of course you</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="5.96">know if I were molar I would be nervous</text>
  <text start="275.7" dur="5.07">too because he had just received</text>
  <text start="279.08" dur="3.82">notification from the Department of</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="4.11">Justice that said he needed to make sure</text>
  <text start="282.9" dur="4.56">that he stayed within his boundaries</text>
  <text start="284.88" dur="3.27">that there were specific boundaries that</text>
  <text start="287.46" dur="2.73">he needed a</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="4.17">- and that had to do with whatever was</text>
  <text start="290.19" dur="4.59">made public in that report and he could</text>
  <text start="292.32" dur="5.64">not answer or give answers that implied</text>
  <text start="294.78" dur="4.82">anything otherwise so we had to be</text>
  <text start="297.96" dur="4.38">careful with the words that he chose</text>
  <text start="299.6" dur="4.9">also you know he was under oath so he</text>
  <text start="302.34" dur="4.02">obviously had to be careful about making</text>
  <text start="304.5" dur="2.61">any statements that could incriminate</text>
  <text start="306.36" dur="2.87">himself</text>
  <text start="307.11" dur="5.73">or you know make it seem that he was</text>
  <text start="309.23" dur="8.08">involved in perjury or something so he</text>
  <text start="312.84" dur="7.8">was very nervous here&amp;#39;s the thing that</text>
  <text start="317.31" dur="6.03">they were not focusing on in the very</text>
  <text start="320.64" dur="5.67">beginning of the testimony he gave a</text>
  <text start="323.34" dur="7.17">five minute long opening statement and</text>
  <text start="326.31" dur="6.48">in that statement he had said that there</text>
  <text start="330.51" dur="5.94">were certain things that he was not</text>
  <text start="332.79" dur="8.76">going to respond to because they have to</text>
  <text start="336.45" dur="8.04">do with on-going investigations this is</text>
  <text start="341.55" dur="4.53">so critically important this point is so</text>
  <text start="344.49" dur="4.02">critically important that I am not even</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="9.71">sure why no one is even really talking</text>
  <text start="348.51" dur="12.27">about this so really the extent that</text>
  <text start="355.79" dur="7.51">it&amp;#39;s being talked about is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.78" dur="4.14">saying Republicans had asked questions</text>
  <text start="363.3" dur="3.63">regarding the origins of the</text>
  <text start="364.92" dur="3.69">investigation and it wasn&amp;#39;t answered</text>
  <text start="366.93" dur="3.93">that these questions were not answered</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="6.48">and so they&amp;#39;re criticizing that fact</text>
  <text start="370.86" dur="8.91">however they&amp;#39;re not focusing on the fact</text>
  <text start="375.09" dur="9.65">that it&amp;#39;s because these are ongoing that</text>
  <text start="379.77" dur="10.19">means that those who were involved in</text>
  <text start="384.74" dur="11.52">the initiation of this investigation are</text>
  <text start="389.96" dur="9.76">under investigation and if you</text>
  <text start="396.26" dur="6.12">understand what this investigation</text>
  <text start="399.72" dur="5.19">really was that it was a coup d&amp;#39;etat</text>
  <text start="402.38" dur="5.8">initially of course it was meant to it</text>
  <text start="404.91" dur="5.43">was designed to sway the election in</text>
  <text start="408.18" dur="5.37">favor of Hillary Clinton to ensure that</text>
  <text start="410.34" dur="5.79">President Trump or candidate Trump at</text>
  <text start="413.55" dur="4.47">that time did not gain the presidency</text>
  <text start="416.13" dur="5.09">but then after that it became a coup</text>
  <text start="418.02" dur="9.32">d&amp;#39;etat the implications of this</text>
  <text start="421.22" dur="9.3">Hevy because this is treason so the most</text>
  <text start="427.34" dur="5.88">important point here was totally and</text>
  <text start="430.52" dur="4.88">completely glossed over by everyone</text>
  <text start="433.22" dur="4.92">who&amp;#39;s covering it right now they are</text>
  <text start="435.4" dur="5.77">completely forgetting to mention that</text>
  <text start="438.14" dur="7.52">the reason why he did not answer those</text>
  <text start="441.17" dur="12.11">questions is because they are ongoing</text>
  <text start="445.66" dur="10.15">investigations of treason high crimes so</text>
  <text start="453.28" dur="6.43">that&amp;#39;s the first thing the second thing</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="7.04">also is that when it comes to</text>
  <text start="459.71" dur="3.14">obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="463.12" dur="6.31">representative John Ratcliffe probably</text>
  <text start="465.92" dur="6.749">made the most important statements</text>
  <text start="469.43" dur="8.94">regarding this entire thing so he</text>
  <text start="472.669" dur="8.611">reminded Muller about the law and so</text>
  <text start="478.37" dur="6.71">really what the law says is that when it</text>
  <text start="481.28" dur="7.26">comes to crimes criminal activity the</text>
  <text start="485.08" dur="5.5">burden of proof is on the prosecution it</text>
  <text start="488.54" dur="4.44">is not on the defense it never has been</text>
  <text start="490.58" dur="5.79">and that is why people tend to get off</text>
  <text start="492.98" dur="6.27">on technicalities for example OJ Simpson</text>
  <text start="496.37" dur="5.46">you know if the glove does not fit you</text>
  <text start="499.25" dur="4.29">must acquit right so the burden of proof</text>
  <text start="501.83" dur="6.39">is on the prosecution not the defense</text>
  <text start="503.54" dur="7.02">you were assumed innocent every single</text>
  <text start="508.22" dur="6.96">citizen of the United States is presumed</text>
  <text start="510.56" dur="8.22">innocent you do not have to prove your</text>
  <text start="515.18" dur="6.83">innocence the prosecution has to prove</text>
  <text start="518.78" dur="6.45">you are guilty right so as far as this</text>
  <text start="522.01" dur="5.86">exoneration goes that is really just a</text>
  <text start="525.23" dur="7.83">it&amp;#39;s just a play on words really it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="527.87" dur="7.89">just it&amp;#39;s not actually real legally</text>
  <text start="533.06" dur="4.77">right because a person does not have to</text>
  <text start="535.76" dur="4.74">be exonerated because they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="537.83" dur="6.09">assumed innocent there&amp;#39;s no such thing</text>
  <text start="540.5" dur="5.79">so of course the report didn&amp;#39;t say that</text>
  <text start="543.92" dur="7.13">he was exonerated okay they could not</text>
  <text start="546.29" dur="7.88">prove that he obstructed justice</text>
  <text start="551.05" dur="6.81">so really volume two</text>
  <text start="554.17" dur="7.92">was more or less for optics it was to</text>
  <text start="557.86" dur="6.93">sway the public opinion to think that</text>
  <text start="562.09" dur="6.69">President Trump was guilty this is not</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="7.2">really legal because if someone is not</text>
  <text start="568.78" dur="7.35">prosecuted then you&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="571.99" dur="8.67">supposed to talk about that possible</text>
  <text start="576.13" dur="8.43">crime right because then that harms an</text>
  <text start="580.66" dur="8.1">individual now you&amp;#39;re smearing that</text>
  <text start="584.56" dur="5.52">individual if you do not find them</text>
  <text start="588.76" dur="6.86">guilty you&amp;#39;re not supposed to talk about</text>
  <text start="590.08" dur="9.78">the case so what John Ratcliffe had said</text>
  <text start="595.62" dur="9.19">was that the responsibility of Muller</text>
  <text start="599.86" dur="7.98">was to either prosecute or talk about it</text>
  <text start="604.81" dur="5.37">this or explain a decision but in volume</text>
  <text start="607.84" dur="6.75">2 there was no explanation of a decision</text>
  <text start="610.18" dur="11.49">in fact it was really a hundred and</text>
  <text start="614.59" dur="10.23">eighty pages of nothing no decision so</text>
  <text start="621.67" dur="8.7">let&amp;#39;s take a look at what Radcliffe had</text>
  <text start="624.82" dur="7.08">said summarize your opening statement</text>
  <text start="630.37" dur="3.24">this morning you said in volume one on</text>
  <text start="631.9" dur="3.27">the issue of conspiracy the special</text>
  <text start="633.61" dur="3.48">counsel determined that the</text>
  <text start="635.17" dur="3.57">investigation did not establish that</text>
  <text start="637.09" dur="3.12">members of the Trump campaign conspired</text>
  <text start="638.74" dur="3.54">or coordinated with the Russian</text>
  <text start="640.21" dur="4.35">government in its election interference</text>
  <text start="642.28" dur="3.78">activities and then in by YouTube for</text>
  <text start="644.56" dur="3.39">reasons that you explained the special</text>
  <text start="646.06" dur="3.18">counsel did not make a determination on</text>
  <text start="647.95" dur="3.51">whether there was an obstruction of</text>
  <text start="649.24" dur="5.01">justice crime committed by the president</text>
  <text start="651.46" dur="4.47">is that fair all right now in explaining</text>
  <text start="654.25" dur="3.45">the special counsel did not make what</text>
  <text start="655.93" dur="4.23">you called a traditional prosecution or</text>
  <text start="657.7" dur="5.85">declination decision the report on the</text>
  <text start="660.16" dur="5.73">bottom of page two of volume 2 reads as</text>
  <text start="663.55" dur="3.99">follows the evidence we obtained about</text>
  <text start="665.89" dur="3.81">the president&amp;#39;s actions and intent</text>
  <text start="667.54" dur="4.89">presents difficult issues that prevent</text>
  <text start="669.7" dur="4.2">us from conclusively determining that no</text>
  <text start="672.43" dur="3.87">criminal conduct occurred accordingly</text>
  <text start="673.9" dur="4.29">while this report does not conclude that</text>
  <text start="676.3" dur="5.22">the president committed a crime it also</text>
  <text start="678.19" dur="6.15">does not exonerate him how I read that</text>
  <text start="681.52" dur="4.98">correctly yes all right now your report</text>
  <text start="684.34" dur="2.96">and today you said at all times</text>
  <text start="686.5" dur="2.69">especially</text>
  <text start="687.3" dur="3.42">council team operated under was guided</text>
  <text start="689.19" dur="4.26">by and followed Justice Department</text>
  <text start="690.72" dur="5.4">policies and principles so which DOJ</text>
  <text start="693.45" dur="4.59">policy or principle sets forth a legal</text>
  <text start="696.12" dur="3.99">standard that an investigated person is</text>
  <text start="698.04" dur="3.859">not exonerated if their innocence from</text>
  <text start="700.11" dur="5.219">criminal criminal conduct is not</text>
  <text start="701.899" dur="5.081">conclusively determined can you repeat</text>
  <text start="705.329" dur="4.38">the last part of that question yeah</text>
  <text start="706.98" dur="4.95">which DOJ policy or principle set forth</text>
  <text start="709.709" dur="4.471">a legal standard that an investigated</text>
  <text start="711.93" dur="3.899">person is not exonerated if their</text>
  <text start="714.18" dur="5.7">innocence from criminal criminal conduct</text>
  <text start="715.829" dur="6.241">is not conclusively determined or does</text>
  <text start="719.88" dur="6.63">that language come from director where</text>
  <text start="722.07" dur="7.68">is the DOJ policy that says that can you</text>
  <text start="726.51" dur="5.069">let me make it easier there usually go</text>
  <text start="729.75" dur="3.36">ahead it can you give me the example</text>
  <text start="731.579" dur="3.091">other than Donald Trump where the</text>
  <text start="733.11" dur="3.69">Justice Department determined that an</text>
  <text start="734.67" dur="3.659">investigated person was not exonerated</text>
  <text start="736.8" dur="4.59">because their innocence was not</text>
  <text start="738.329" dur="4.651">conclusively determined I cannot</text>
  <text start="741.39" dur="3.81">participate</text>
  <text start="742.98" dur="3.84">you can&amp;#39;t time is short I&amp;#39;ve got five</text>
  <text start="745.2" dur="3.509">minutes let&amp;#39;s just leave it you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="746.82" dur="4.889">find it because I&amp;#39;ll tell you why it</text>
  <text start="748.709" dur="4.531">doesn&amp;#39;t exist the special counsels job</text>
  <text start="751.709" dur="3.421">nowhere does it say that you were to</text>

  <text start="899.99" dur="6.15">side of the aisle as they do dramatic</text>
  <text start="901.79" dur="6.57">readings from this report that volume 2</text>
  <text start="906.14" dur="5.43">of this report was not authorized under</text>
  <text start="908.36" dur="5.13">the law to be written it was written to</text>
  <text start="911.57" dur="3.54">a legal standard that does not exist at</text>
  <text start="913.49" dur="3.72">the Justice Department and it was</text>
  <text start="915.11" dur="4.44">written in violation of every DOJ</text>
  <text start="917.21" dur="4.65">principle about extra prosecutorial</text>
  <text start="919.55" dur="3.75">commentary I agree with the chairman</text>
  <text start="921.86" dur="3.75">this morning when he said Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="923.3" dur="4.14">is not above the law he&amp;#39;s not but he</text>
  <text start="925.61" dur="3.81">damn sure shouldn&amp;#39;t be below the law</text>
  <text start="927.44" dur="6.45">which is where volume 2 of this report</text>
  <text start="929.42" dur="8.34">puts him so the point here is that</text>
  <text start="933.89" dur="7.77">volume 1 determined that President Trump</text>
  <text start="937.76" dur="8.46">and his campaign did not commit</text>
  <text start="941.66" dur="8.61">conspiracy with the Russians also volume</text>
  <text start="946.22" dur="5.92">2 is completely unnecessary and the</text>
  <text start="950.27" dur="8.23">publication of it</text>
  <text start="952.14" dur="9.03">is likely illegal and unethical also the</text>
  <text start="958.5" dur="5.57">final point here that is really a major</text>
  <text start="961.17" dur="6.27">takeaway is that there is currently an</text>
  <text start="964.07" dur="5.68">investigation ongoing that has to do</text>
  <text start="967.44" dur="7.23">with the origins of this investigation</text>
  <text start="969.75" dur="6.24">which really boils down to treason those</text>
  <text start="974.67" dur="4.89">are the major points of the Moller</text>
  <text start="975.99" dur="5.34">testimony all right so related to that</text>
  <text start="979.56" dur="5.73">of course you know the Democrats they</text>
  <text start="981.33" dur="6.18">absolutely will not give up on trying to</text>
  <text start="985.29" dur="5.07">push for impeachment no matter what even</text>
  <text start="987.51" dur="4.65">though they know that there are no</text>
  <text start="990.36" dur="3.69">grounds for impeachment they will dig</text>
  <text start="992.16" dur="5.25">and dig and grasp at straws until they</text>
  <text start="994.05" dur="9.15">find one so now they are going to try to</text>
  <text start="997.41" dur="7.47">enforce magan to testify now really why</text>
  <text start="1003.2" dur="4.71">they want him to testify is because they</text>
  <text start="1004.88" dur="5.67">want to show that President Trump was</text>
  <text start="1007.91" dur="8.3">obstructing justice because he had</text>
  <text start="1010.55" dur="5.66">wanted to fire Robert Miller early on</text>
  <text start="1016.66" dur="6.64">but here&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="1019.45" dur="8.29">Moeller was not fired and he was able to</text>
  <text start="1023.3" dur="6.51">finish his investigation so if I say to</text>
  <text start="1027.74" dur="4.53">someone wow I really want to rob a bank</text>
  <text start="1029.81" dur="4.17">right now that does not make me guilty</text>
  <text start="1032.27" dur="6.63">of robbing a bank because I have not</text>
  <text start="1033.98" dur="6.54">committed bank robbery I have had a</text>
  <text start="1038.9" dur="3.36">thought about it or I made a statement</text>
  <text start="1040.52" dur="4.05">about it does it even mean that that was</text>
  <text start="1042.26" dur="5.85">a sincere thought or a sincere intention</text>
  <text start="1044.57" dur="6.48">no I made a statement but I did not</text>
  <text start="1048.11" dur="4.53">commit a crime you cannot find someone</text>
  <text start="1051.05" dur="8.58">guilty of a crime that they have not</text>
  <text start="1052.64" dur="9.6">committed so really making McGann</text>
  <text start="1059.63" dur="6.09">testify is completely meaningless</text>
  <text start="1062.24" dur="5.61">just like the Moller testimony yesterday</text>
  <text start="1065.72" dur="4.46">was completely meaningless the whole</text>
  <text start="1067.85" dur="5.78">report is already public the Moller</text>
  <text start="1070.18" dur="3.45">investigation is over</text>
  <text start="1073.84" dur="7.75">Moeller was never fired so there is</text>
  <text start="1077.81" dur="5.49">nothing for McGann to testify on but</text>
  <text start="1081.59" dur="3.84">again they are so desperate at this</text>
  <text start="1083.3" dur="5.1">point they are grasping at anything</text>
  <text start="1085.43" dur="4.29">in an update on tensions with Iran this</text>
  <text start="1088.4" dur="4.17">is coming out of the Associated Press</text>
  <text start="1089.72" dur="6.84">Iran&amp;#39;s president hints at quid pro quo</text>
  <text start="1092.57" dur="5.97">for seized UK ship so the Iranian</text>
  <text start="1096.56" dur="5.34">president has said that they would</text>
  <text start="1098.54" dur="5.49">release the UK oil tanker if Britain</text>
  <text start="1101.9" dur="4.82">agreed to do the same now there is</text>
  <text start="1104.03" dur="7.53">speculation that this most recent</text>
  <text start="1106.72" dur="7.15">de-escalation of tensions may be because</text>
  <text start="1111.56" dur="5.37">the Iraqi Prime Minister who recently</text>
  <text start="1113.87" dur="5.73">visited Iran may have negotiated these</text>
  <text start="1116.93" dur="6.33">terms so this is a good thing because</text>
  <text start="1119.6" dur="6.36">that brings us steps further away from a</text>
  <text start="1123.26" dur="4.92">war scenario which is a good thing in</text>
  <text start="1125.96" dur="4.14">other news president Donald Trump has</text>
  <text start="1128.18" dur="5.43">just expanded Isis powers for</text>
  <text start="1130.1" dur="6.99">deportation by really just expanding an</text>
  <text start="1133.61" dur="6.96">existing law that had differentiated</text>
  <text start="1137.09" dur="8.37">between illegals who arrived by sea and</text>
  <text start="1140.57" dur="7.71">those who arrived on land so previously</text>
  <text start="1145.46" dur="4.68">the difference was that those who came</text>
  <text start="1148.28" dur="4.65">here and were apprehended who had</text>
  <text start="1150.14" dur="5.37">arrived by sea they were deported</text>
  <text start="1152.93" dur="4.26">without court oversight they were not</text>
  <text start="1155.51" dur="4.17">entitled to an immigration hearing</text>
  <text start="1157.19" dur="4.4">unless of course they could prove that</text>
  <text start="1159.68" dur="6.66">they had been here for two years or more</text>
  <text start="1161.59" dur="8.95">on the other hand those who were</text>
  <text start="1166.34" dur="7.14">apprehended on land within 14 days of</text>
  <text start="1170.54" dur="5.4">crossing the border and within a hundred</text>
  <text start="1173.48" dur="5.67">miles of the border were entitled to an</text>
  <text start="1175.94" dur="5.4">immigration hearing of course that meant</text>
  <text start="1179.15" dur="6.39">that they were detained sometimes for</text>
  <text start="1181.34" dur="7.53">upwards to 51 days or longer and then</text>
  <text start="1185.54" dur="5.49">also even after they were released a lot</text>
  <text start="1188.87" dur="3.51">of them didn&amp;#39;t even return for their</text>
  <text start="1191.03" dur="4.56">court hearing and they just remained</text>
  <text start="1192.38" dur="5.76">here so a lot of money is being spent on</text>
  <text start="1195.59" dur="5.15">detentions and also you know besides</text>
  <text start="1198.14" dur="6.54">just the money that is expended on</text>
  <text start="1200.74" dur="6.25">detentions but also we don&amp;#39;t have room</text>
  <text start="1204.68" dur="4.83">there are too many people there is a</text>
  <text start="1206.99" dur="8.4">backlog of almost a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="1209.51" dur="8.549">individuals so what this new expansion</text>
  <text start="1215.39" dur="6.539">does is it takes away</text>
  <text start="1218.059" dur="7.98">the limitations regarding geographical</text>
  <text start="1221.929" dur="8.1">locations so now everyone is classified</text>
  <text start="1226.039" dur="8.85">as the same so now anyone who crosses</text>
  <text start="1230.029" dur="9.24">the border illegally they are going to</text>
  <text start="1234.889" dur="6.62">be deported unless they can prove that</text>
  <text start="1239.269" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;ve been here for two years or more</text>
  <text start="1241.509" dur="8.23">so this completely skips over the whole</text>
  <text start="1245.299" dur="6.75">core oversight and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1249.739" dur="6.331">criticizing it because you know they say</text>
  <text start="1252.049" dur="6.12">that these individuals are deported that</text>
  <text start="1256.07" dur="3.719">they you know don&amp;#39;t have a hearing and</text>
  <text start="1258.169" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re not even represented by a lawyer</text>
  <text start="1259.789" dur="4.5">they are not American citizens they just</text>
  <text start="1262.759" dur="3.87">cross the border illegally they broke</text>
  <text start="1264.289" dur="4.46">the law they need to go back that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1266.629" dur="5.73">point</text>
  <text start="1268.749" dur="6.37">so now this is going to be a good thing</text>
  <text start="1272.359" dur="4.5">we have expedited deportations you cross</text>
  <text start="1275.119" dur="5.85">illegally you&amp;#39;re apprehended you&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="1276.859" dur="6.18">of here you&amp;#39;re done in other news this</text>

  <text start="1437.09" dur="5.64">ultimate result was that Hillary who is</text>

  <text start="1450.86" dur="5.22">then so he took those emails and he</text>
  <text start="1454.64" dur="5.07">released it to WikiLeaks so that</text>
  <text start="1456.08" dur="5.37">WikiLeaks could expose it now the</text>
  <text start="1459.71" dur="3.72">narrative that the mainstream media has</text>
  <text start="1461.45" dur="4.62">been trying to push is that it was the</text>
  <text start="1463.43" dur="4.86">Russians that hacked the DNC server and</text>
  <text start="1466.07" dur="4.29">then that&amp;#39;s how WikiLeaks obtained that</text>
  <text start="1468.29" dur="4.23">information of course that&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="1470.36" dur="4.7">their go-to it&amp;#39;s always the Russians the</text>
  <text start="1472.52" dur="4.71">Russians are responsible for everything</text>
  <text start="1475.06" dur="8.349">so</text>
  <text start="1477.23" dur="8.549">that is their alibi so they want to make</text>
  <text start="1483.409" dur="4.561">sure that Seth rich has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="1485.779" dur="3.601">with the email case whatsoever they want</text>
  <text start="1487.97" dur="4.919">to distance themselves as much as</text>
  <text start="1489.38" dur="6.96">possible however a recent analysis of</text>
  <text start="1492.889" dur="8.28">those emails had all but definitively</text>
  <text start="1496.34" dur="6.569">proven that it was impossible for the</text>
  <text start="1501.169" dur="4.171">Russians to have hacked into the DNC</text>
  <text start="1502.909" dur="4.351">server because when they analyzed the</text>
  <text start="1505.34" dur="4.469">speed at which was downloaded it was</text>
  <text start="1507.26" dur="6.86">much too fast for it to be and across</text>
  <text start="1509.809" dur="7.11">the pond hack it just didn&amp;#39;t match up so</text>
  <text start="1514.12" dur="5.429">really what it looked like was that it</text>
  <text start="1516.919" dur="4.86">was downloaded probably to a local Drive</text>
  <text start="1519.549" dur="5.531">which makes sense so if you think about</text>
  <text start="1521.779" dur="5.37">it in terms of Seth rich taking the</text>
  <text start="1525.08" dur="3.93">email so he probably downloaded it to a</text>
  <text start="1527.149" dur="4.671">thumb drive and then handed it off to</text>
  <text start="1529.01" dur="7.529">WikiLeaks that&amp;#39;s what happened</text>
  <text start="1531.82" dur="7.06">so but if they determine that that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1536.539" dur="4.921">possibility then his murder looks rather</text>
  <text start="1538.88" dur="5.49">suspicious even though it already looked</text>
  <text start="1541.46" dur="5.25">suspicious enough so Seth rich was</text>
  <text start="1544.37" dur="5.159">murdered outside very close to his</text>
  <text start="1546.71" dur="5.099">apartment very close to his apartment</text>
  <text start="1549.529" dur="5.671">and they claimed that it was a botched</text>
  <text start="1551.809" dur="8.521">robbery however he had all of his</text>
  <text start="1555.2" dur="8.699">valuables still on him he wasn&amp;#39;t dead on</text>
  <text start="1560.33" dur="6.66">the scene at the scene he was still</text>
  <text start="1563.899" dur="6.201">alive when he went to the hospital then</text>
  <text start="1566.99" dur="5.789">he died shortly thereafter some point</text>
  <text start="1570.1" dur="5.289">during his very brief stay at the</text>
  <text start="1572.779" dur="6.301">hospital Donna Brazile was at that</text>
  <text start="1575.389" dur="5.91">hospital even though she claims that she</text>
  <text start="1579.08" dur="5.43">was nowhere near the hospital and was</text>
  <text start="1581.299" dur="5.85">not even in DC but her phone records</text>
  <text start="1584.51" dur="5.07">indicate that she was in Washington DC</text>
  <text start="1587.149" dur="5.691">so why would she lie about that maybe</text>
  <text start="1589.58" dur="6.51">it&amp;#39;s because she&amp;#39;s guilty of something</text>
  <text start="1592.84" dur="5.14">so now there&amp;#39;s this lawsuit and this</text>
  <text start="1596.09" dur="4.38">lawsuit was filed by Ed bouton see a</text>
  <text start="1597.98" dur="4.14">Buttowski was a contributor for Fox and</text>
  <text start="1600.47" dur="4.11">he&amp;#39;s the one who came out with that</text>
  <text start="1602.12" dur="5.97">story about Seth rich being the source</text>
  <text start="1604.58" dur="5.579">well then other contributors and other</text>
  <text start="1608.09" dur="2.97">reporters and a slew of other folks had</text>
  <text start="1610.159" dur="3.781">come out saying the</text>
  <text start="1611.06" dur="4.68">that information was inaccurate so he</text>
  <text start="1613.94" dur="4.47">filed a lawsuit saying was defamation</text>
  <text start="1615.74" dur="5.79">now there&amp;#39;s been an amendment to that</text>
  <text start="1618.41" dur="6.48">lawsuit bringing in ellen ratner who is</text>
  <text start="1621.53" dur="6.03">a well-known media figure so now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1624.89" dur="6.48">saying that he got his information about</text>
  <text start="1627.56" dur="5.25">seth rich being the source from her so</text>
  <text start="1631.37" dur="2.88">this of course lends credence to his</text>
  <text start="1632.81" dur="5.1">story because she has more credibility</text>
  <text start="1634.25" dur="5.19">than he does so this is gonna get</text>
  <text start="1637.91" dur="3.63">interesting and I&amp;#39;m gonna follow this to</text>
  <text start="1639.44" dur="6.05">see where it goes because I&amp;#39;m really</text>
  <text start="1641.54" dur="9.45">hoping that they rehash this story</text>
  <text start="1645.49" dur="7.5">because they need to find justice for</text>
  <text start="1650.99" dur="6.06">this young man</text>
  <text start="1652.99" dur="7.39">these people at the top have to know</text>

  <text start="1689.3" dur="4.23">early 90s now this is coming out of The</text>
  <text start="1691.82" dur="3.57">Daily Beast and could spell big trouble</text>
  <text start="1693.53" dur="3.78">for Bill Clinton who wasted no time</text>
  <text start="1695.39" dur="4.62">coming out and saying that he had</text>
  <text start="1697.31" dur="4.65">nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein or</text>
  <text start="1700.01" dur="5.49">his crimes that he had actually had no</text>
  <text start="1701.96" dur="5.91">idea that they were going on so his</text>
  <text start="1705.5" dur="5.55">official statement had made claims that</text>
  <text start="1707.87" dur="5.04">he only was on the plane six times even</text>
  <text start="1711.05" dur="6.45">though the log says that he was on the</text>
  <text start="1712.91" dur="6.06">plane 27 times also he claims that he</text>
  <text start="1717.5" dur="3.48">didn&amp;#39;t really establish a relationship</text>
  <text start="1718.97" dur="3.03">with Epstein until after he left the</text>
  <text start="1720.98" dur="3.96">presidential office</text>
  <text start="1722" dur="7.77">however records show that Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="1724.94" dur="6.84">Epstein had donated as early as 1993</text>
  <text start="1729.77" dur="4.74">which was the very first year that Bill</text>
  <text start="1731.78" dur="4.98">Clinton was president and he had</text>
  <text start="1734.51" dur="5.52">attended a donors reception hosted by</text>
  <text start="1736.76" dur="5.28">the Clintons Bill Clinton had also</text>
  <text start="1740.03" dur="3.91">attended an intimate fundraising dinner</text>
  <text start="1742.04" dur="4.479">in Palm Beach in 1995</text>
  <text start="1743.94" dur="4.38">home of Revlon mogul with Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="1746.519" dur="4.321">Epstein and of course this was steps</text>
  <text start="1748.32" dur="4.949">away from Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s own home</text>
  <text start="1750.84" dur="6.059">where at this point we know that sex</text>
  <text start="1753.269" dur="5.941">trafficking of minors had occurred also</text>
  <text start="1756.899" dur="4.711">Chelsea Clinton had a rather cozy</text>
  <text start="1759.21" dur="5.099">relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell who</text>
  <text start="1761.61" dur="5.88">now at this point we understand is the</text>
  <text start="1764.309" dur="6.061">madam for Jeffrey Epstein so they had</text>
  <text start="1767.49" dur="4.47">vacation together and also Maxwell had</text>
  <text start="1770.37" dur="5.039">attended Chelsea Clinton&amp;#39;s wedding in</text>
  <text start="1771.96" dur="6.689">2010 which mind you was after Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="1775.409" dur="4.62">Epstein was convicted so they must have</text>
  <text start="1778.649" dur="4.11">known then that at least there was some</text>
  <text start="1780.029" dur="7.321">suspicion that he was involved in some</text>
  <text start="1782.759" dur="8.101">pretty sketchy activity also Epstein had</text>
  <text start="1787.35" dur="5.97">met with Mark Middleton at least three</text>
  <text start="1790.86" dur="4.89">times and of course Mark Middleton is</text>
  <text start="1793.32" dur="4.65">another friend he&amp;#39;s a friend of Bill</text>
  <text start="1795.75" dur="4.44">Clinton&amp;#39;s from Arkansas so when Bill</text>
  <text start="1797.97" dur="4.38">Clinton took the presidency he brought</text>
  <text start="1800.19" dur="4.229">with him several of his buddies from</text>
  <text start="1802.35" dur="5.88">Arkansas so this was one of those folks</text>
  <text start="1804.419" dur="6.36">and so the details of those meetings</text>
  <text start="1808.23" dur="4.38">were not actually revealed and no one</text>
  <text start="1810.779" dur="3.841">could reach Middleton for comment</text>
  <text start="1812.61" dur="4.289">whatsoever so we don&amp;#39;t know what they</text>
  <text start="1814.62" dur="4.23">talked about so one of the more</text>
  <text start="1816.899" dur="4.02">interesting folks that I find in this</text>
  <text start="1818.85" dur="5.64">article is actually a man by the name of</text>
  <text start="1820.919" dur="7.86">Paul Prosperi pauperis parry was an</text>
  <text start="1824.49" dur="6.029">attorney who had a very close friendship</text>
  <text start="1828.779" dur="5.331">with Bill Clinton and had once since</text>
  <text start="1830.519" dur="7.231">their college days in Arkansas and then</text>
  <text start="1834.11" dur="5.62">they continued that friendship all the</text>
  <text start="1837.75" dur="5.58">way through Bill Clinton&amp;#39;s presidency</text>
  <text start="1839.73" dur="5.34">and it seems as though Paul Prosperi was</text>
  <text start="1843.33" dur="4.319">actually acting as sort of a middleman</text>
  <text start="1845.07" dur="7.17">for all of these donations including the</text>
  <text start="1847.649" dur="6.9">one from Jeffrey Epstein now there were</text>
  <text start="1852.24" dur="4.889">some more interesting things about that</text>
  <text start="1854.549" dur="6">during this time soap-opera Sperry was</text>
  <text start="1857.129" dur="7.971">found guilty of embezzlement in the 90s</text>
  <text start="1860.549" dur="6.981">and then he decided to appeal that in</text>
  <text start="1865.1" dur="5.31">1997</text>
  <text start="1867.53" dur="6.27">and also conveniently at the time when</text>
  <text start="1870.41" dur="7.32">he was appealing this conviction he was</text>
  <text start="1873.8" dur="6.21">diagnosed of a disease called miss my</text>
  <text start="1877.73" dur="4.77">Athenian Grievous sorry myasthenia</text>
  <text start="1880.01" dur="6.69">gravis and what that is is an autoimmune</text>
  <text start="1882.5" dur="6.42">disorder that attacks the nervous system</text>
  <text start="1886.7" dur="5.52">and so it makes it difficult for people</text>
  <text start="1888.92" dur="5.88">to walk and talk and even swallow but</text>
  <text start="1892.22" dur="5.82">with treatment of course this disorder</text>
  <text start="1894.8" dur="5.46">can really be managed to the point where</text>
  <text start="1898.04" dur="7.5">a person who has this diagnosis can live</text>
  <text start="1900.26" dur="7.23">a full life and also symptoms for this</text>
  <text start="1905.54" dur="3.81">disorder can even go into remission so</text>
  <text start="1907.49" dur="3.69">how convenient you&amp;#39;re diagnosed with a</text>
  <text start="1909.35" dur="7.53">disorder that you know can go away any</text>
  <text start="1911.18" dur="9.15">point in time so this guy who was trying</text>
  <text start="1916.88" dur="6.96">to appeal this conviction he ends up</text>
  <text start="1920.33" dur="6.42">getting his sentence commuted in 2001 by</text>
  <text start="1923.84" dur="7.2">Bill Clinton in the last days of his</text>
  <text start="1926.75" dur="6.36">presidency and so instead of serving</text>
  <text start="1931.04" dur="6.48">five years in jail he ended up serving</text>
  <text start="1933.11" dur="7.26">three years of house arrest now this was</text>
  <text start="1937.52" dur="5.91">done the very last days of Bill</text>
  <text start="1940.37" dur="4.92">Clinton&amp;#39;s presidency and this guy</text>
  <text start="1943.43" dur="5.25">Prosperi he was not the only one who</text>
  <text start="1945.29" dur="5.22">benefited at this time in fact over a</text>
  <text start="1948.68" dur="5.88">hundred and forty individuals were</text>
  <text start="1950.51" dur="9.18">pardoned in the final days of his tongue</text>
  <text start="1954.56" dur="9.42">and some of those included people who</text>
  <text start="1959.69" dur="8.67">were guilty of cocaine running and also</text>
  <text start="1963.98" dur="6.48">another guy who was pardoned literally</text>
  <text start="1968.36" dur="4.11">on the last day of Bill Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1970.46" dur="5.33">presidency in the midnight hours the</text>
  <text start="1972.47" dur="6.57">final hours so it completely went around</text>
  <text start="1975.79" dur="5.38">Justice Department review it wasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1979.04" dur="6.63">reviewed by the Justice Department it</text>
  <text start="1981.17" dur="7.65">slipped quietly through Marc Rich who</text>
  <text start="1985.67" dur="9.39">was a wealthy financier who is guilty of</text>
  <text start="1988.82" dur="10.22">trading with Iran during the embargo so</text>
  <text start="1995.06" dur="3.98">we&amp;#39;re talking iran-contra</text>
  <text start="1999.64" dur="8.67">okay the iran-contra scandal now the</text>
  <text start="2003.9" dur="7.05">article that was talking about this was</text>
  <text start="2008.31" dur="4.29">saying how curious it was that all of</text>
  <text start="2010.95" dur="5.31">these individuals were pardoned and how</text>
  <text start="2012.6" dur="6.09">mostly they weren&amp;#39;t related none of them</text>
  <text start="2016.26" dur="6.92">were related I beg to differ</text>
  <text start="2018.69" dur="4.49">because when you look at it as I hope</text>
  <text start="2025.07" dur="7.3">Marc Rich financier found guilty of</text>
