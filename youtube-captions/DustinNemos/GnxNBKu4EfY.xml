  <text start="298.7" dur="3.81">know not as ahead of the curve they</text>
  <text start="300.11" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t pay as much attention so I think</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="5.19">that he is he&amp;#39;s panicking we already</text>
  <text start="304.91" dur="4.56">know jack doors he&amp;#39;s panicking you know</text>

  <text start="309.47" dur="4.02">gonna be destroyed it&amp;#39;s you know you</text>
  <text start="311.75" dur="4.89">think about MySpace and it&amp;#39;s just like a</text>
  <text start="313.49" dur="5.1">graveyard yeah that&amp;#39;s what Facebook is</text>
  <text start="316.64" dur="3.6">gonna turn into in the future and really</text>
  <text start="318.59" dur="3.72">they self-destructed which is sad</text>
  <text start="320.24" dur="4.2">because they colluded with the Democrats</text>
  <text start="322.31" dur="4.17">during 2016 election</text>
  <text start="324.44" dur="4.979">Mark Zuckerberg met personally with</text>
  <text start="326.48" dur="5.64">Hillary Clinton and John Podesta via the</text>
  <text start="329.419" dur="4.5">WikiLeaks emails came out so obviously</text>
  <text start="332.12" dur="3.36">we know who these people are</text>
  <text start="333.919" dur="5.911">you know it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re brought out just</text>
  <text start="335.48" dur="5.64">like politicians yeah I know we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="339.83" dur="4.02">talk about some other stuff real fast</text>
  <text start="341.12" dur="8.07">have you on the legal and have you heard</text>
  <text start="343.85" dur="7.319">about the comparison between the lawsuit</text>
  <text start="349.19" dur="3.63">with the the bakery the famous lawsuit</text>
  <text start="351.169" dur="4.111">with the bakery and the gay wedding cake</text>
  <text start="352.82" dur="3.99">and the comparisons to what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="355.28" dur="3.6">with with what they&amp;#39;re doing with the</text>
  <text start="356.81" dur="5.25">censorship here yes so my understanding</text>
  <text start="358.88" dur="6.42">is in that case they consider the bakery</text>
  <text start="362.06" dur="4.8">to be part of a public square and you</text>
  <text start="365.3" dur="5.73">know they&amp;#39;re providing a service to the</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="6.119">square cakes okay and what was it a gay</text>
  <text start="371.03" dur="3.66">couple came in wanting to get a cake</text>
  <text start="372.979" dur="3.721">right yeah</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="3.57">and they were I think it went to the</text>
  <text start="376.7" dur="3.029">Supreme Court and they were forced to</text>
  <text start="378.26" dur="3.54">bake them the cake</text>
  <text start="379.729" dur="4.681">is that correct Lia&amp;#39;s Sotomayor somebody</text>
  <text start="381.8" dur="5.22">yeah yeah so you know they take them to</text>
  <text start="384.41" dur="5.58">court and they basically say well just</text>
  <text start="387.02" dur="4.74">because they are a certain way you know</text>
  <text start="389.99" dur="3.78">whether it&amp;#39;s color their skin their</text>
  <text start="391.76" dur="2.79">sexual preference you know their</text>
  <text start="393.77" dur="3.709">political</text>
  <text start="394.55" dur="6.6">you know the politics you cannot refuse</text>
  <text start="397.479" dur="6.011">service just because of you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="401.15" dur="4.62">a certain way whatever their preferences</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="3.72">and so that was the ruling and now</text>
  <text start="405.77" dur="3.57">whenever you base</text>
  <text start="407.21" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s anti-discrimination which is how it</text>
  <text start="409.34" dur="4.949">should be you know you shouldn&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="410.96" dur="5.4">shouldn&amp;#39;t have to there shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="414.289" dur="3.301">people going around you know not selling</text>
  <text start="416.36" dur="2.52">things for certain reasons at</text>
  <text start="417.59" dur="4.32">discriminating against people obviously</text>
  <text start="418.88" dur="5.039">that&amp;#39;s anti-american but like you said</text>
  <text start="421.91" dur="3.599">it does relate to what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="423.919" dur="4.321">think about the internet like a public</text>
  <text start="425.509" dur="5.401">square that Facebook over here it&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="428.24" dur="4.079">Twitter of air YouTube and really all</text>
  <text start="430.91" dur="3.09">that&amp;#39;s happening here is for spreading</text>
  <text start="432.319" dur="4.35">information all right so they have a</text>
  <text start="434" dur="4.74">monopoly on information we don&amp;#39;t listen</text>
  <text start="436.669" dur="4.201">to the newspapers and if we get the news</text>
  <text start="438.74" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s online or spreading it through</text>
  <text start="440.87" dur="5.88">Twitter you know and here&amp;#39;s the argument</text>
  <text start="443.84" dur="4.139">all right they&amp;#39;re banning me from using</text>
  <text start="446.75" dur="3.15">the public square and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="447.979" dur="4.5">letting me use your service for instance</text>
  <text start="449.9" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re not giving me the cake just</text>
  <text start="452.479" dur="3.931">because I have a maggot head on just</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="4.53">because I&amp;#39;m a trump supporter you know</text>
  <text start="456.41" dur="3.99">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s crazy it&amp;#39;s not gonna hold</text>
  <text start="458.96" dur="1.98">up in court they know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.4" dur="3.21">screwed</text>
  <text start="460.94" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;d be surprised if they even want to</text>
  <text start="463.61" dur="4.38">take me to court but I welcome the</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="5.009">challenge you know I have all this</text>
  <text start="467.99" dur="5">evidence I have these PDFs 40 pages long</text>
  <text start="470.539" dur="5.25">the whole timeline from the 90s on</text>
  <text start="472.99" dur="4.84">started in the Clinton White House you</text>
  <text start="475.789" dur="4.111">know legal documents that are just out</text>
  <text start="477.83" dur="4.709">there did you hear about the patent</text>
  <text start="479.9" dur="4.23">thing yeah of course what that is is</text>
  <text start="482.539" dur="4.051">Michael McKibben he&amp;#39;s from leader</text>
  <text start="484.13" dur="5.759">technologies and he patented social</text>
  <text start="486.59" dur="5.49">media and the rule is the rule you know</text>
  <text start="489.889" dur="4.471">the federal government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="492.08" dur="5.67">apparently allowed to steal your patent</text>
  <text start="494.36" dur="5.58">if they can weaponize it so think about</text>
  <text start="497.75" dur="4.65">that they stole the social media patent</text>
  <text start="499.94" dur="5.49">why so weaponize it and there you know</text>
  <text start="502.4" dur="5.73">they form Facebook they form Google they</text>
  <text start="505.43" dur="4.049">do all this that and it&amp;#39;s really gonna</text>
  <text start="508.13" dur="4.019">come back to hurt them because the</text>
  <text start="509.479" dur="4.771">problem is now I can argue that Facebook</text>
  <text start="512.149" dur="4.621">and Google are the customers and not</text>
  <text start="514.25" dur="5.82">only that Facebook and Google combined</text>
  <text start="516.77" dur="8.37">only them because Google owns YouTube</text>
  <text start="520.07" dur="7.53">and a whole sort of sites they host 70%</text>
  <text start="525.14" dur="3.96">of all Internet traffic on the Internet</text>
  <text start="527.6" dur="4.89">and if you look at the Sherman Antitrust</text>
  <text start="529.1" dur="6.72">Act of 1890 it states clearly that if a</text>
  <text start="532.49" dur="6.12">company brings in two-thirds of the</text>
  <text start="535.82" dur="5.23">revenue and a market or if there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="538.61" dur="5.02">sort of deal between two businesses</text>
  <text start="541.05" dur="4.349">they can be broken up and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="543.63" dur="4.53">it comes up because you have these new</text>
  <text start="545.399" dur="4.56">guys that are gonna be appointed to</text>
  <text start="548.16" dur="5.73">Trump&amp;#39;s Federal Trade Commission it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="549.959" dur="5.281">the FTC not the FCC the FTC which is</text>
  <text start="553.89" dur="3.09">important because what we&amp;#39;re trading</text>
  <text start="555.24" dur="4.23">here is a service and information</text>
  <text start="556.98" dur="5.58">essentially but what they said is these</text>
  <text start="559.47" dur="6.179">guys are gonna be confirmed soon by</text>
  <text start="562.56" dur="5.219">Trump and they said on February 14 2018</text>
  <text start="565.649" dur="5.221">they would be open to considering</text>
  <text start="567.779" dur="6.841">antitrust action against big tap firms</text>
  <text start="570.87" dur="5.64">Google and Facebook interesting that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="574.62" dur="4.589">exciting man I&amp;#39;m feeling more and more</text>
  <text start="576.51" dur="5.22">optimistic about this our chances with</text>

  <text start="581.73" dur="4.349">and what people are I mean there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="583.74" dur="4.56">of misinformation just people trying to</text>
  <text start="586.079" dur="4.411">make sense of all this stuff and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="588.3" dur="4.14">saying well you know Isaac you should</text>
  <text start="590.49" dur="3.36">band together with Alex and you know you</text>
  <text start="592.44" dur="3.42">guys should do it together and that way</text>
  <text start="593.85" dur="6">you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to or you should do a</text>
  <text start="595.86" dur="6.32">cloud these issues are related and so</text>
  <text start="599.85" dur="4.77">once they all get filed in federal court</text>
  <text start="602.18" dur="4.18">they&amp;#39;re not gonna want to try us all</text>
  <text start="604.62" dur="3.24">over the United States all over the</text>
  <text start="606.36" dur="3.09">place a whole bunch of different trials</text>
  <text start="607.86" dur="3.18">a whole bunch of different chords whole</text>
  <text start="609.45" dur="5.94">bunch of different judges it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="611.04" dur="6.81">gonna end up into one big issue it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="615.39" dur="4.38">hard to explain legally because I</text>
  <text start="617.85" dur="4.02">obviously I&amp;#39;m new to this stuff I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="619.77" dur="4.5">you know I didn&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d be involved</text>
  <text start="621.87" dur="6.3">in this type of case even a few months</text>
  <text start="624.27" dur="5.819">ago but you know that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="628.17" dur="4.08">about is the antitrust and I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="630.089" dur="3.781">all going to I mean I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="632.25" dur="4.64">we&amp;#39;ll all be in the same court but all</text>
  <text start="633.87" dur="7.11">the issues will basically combine and</text>
  <text start="636.89" dur="6.52">it&amp;#39;s gonna make a ton of evidence that</text>
  <text start="640.98" dur="4.44">this is actually going on and I think</text>
  <text start="643.41" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s no way they get out of there in</text>
  <text start="645.42" dur="4.169">court because I mean it&amp;#39;s obvious that</text>
  <text start="647.64" dur="5.93">they&amp;#39;re targeting us now why not any of</text>
  <text start="649.589" dur="7.74">the Liberals why not CNN like you know</text>
  <text start="653.57" dur="6.329">yeah young turks are those guys my only</text>
  <text start="657.329" dur="5.801">fear is that the courts are so rigged</text>
  <text start="659.899" dur="6.321">yeah oh</text>
  <text start="663.13" dur="6.99">New Hampshire is actually nice according</text>
  <text start="666.22" dur="5.49">to Natasha so what can we do man at this</text>
  <text start="670.12" dur="2.88">point it&amp;#39;s like you know well you can</text>
  <text start="671.71" dur="3.6">say well the courts are rigged you</text>
  <text start="673" dur="4.17">shouldn&amp;#39;t do it well I I think we should</text>
  <text start="675.31" dur="5.06">try for sure and because public opinion</text>
  <text start="677.17" dur="5.79">is still gonna hopefully give us like a</text>
  <text start="680.37" dur="4.87">boost in this and we&amp;#39;re gonna draw a lot</text>
  <text start="682.96" dur="4.23">of attention to the issues and then of</text>
  <text start="685.24" dur="3.59">course you&amp;#39;ve got the FCC which is the</text>
  <text start="687.19" dur="5.49">Federal Trade Commission that could</text>
  <text start="688.83" dur="5.83">essentially act for us and just because</text>
  <text start="692.68" dur="4.16">what&amp;#39;s great about it is I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="694.66" dur="4.65">end up paying this bigshot lawyer and</text>
  <text start="696.84" dur="4.78">wasting a million bucks or something off</text>
  <text start="699.31" dur="4.53">of crowdfunding I mean I don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="701.62" dur="3.66">money for that who has a million bucks</text>
  <text start="703.84" dur="3.63">other than the people that have been</text>
  <text start="705.28" dur="5.37">selling out this country pretty mom</text>
  <text start="707.47" dur="6.47">saying yeah so it&amp;#39;s good that I can just</text>
  <text start="710.65" dur="5.46">I think was around 700 to file the case</text>
  <text start="713.94" dur="4.99">because I have to try six different</text>
  <text start="716.11" dur="4.53">companies um but you know it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="718.93" dur="4.5">honestly at this point it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="720.64" dur="6.12">gonna shoot my shot I&amp;#39;m not backing down</text>
  <text start="723.43" dur="4.8">and it&amp;#39;s like I can&amp;#39;t wait for and the</text>
  <text start="726.76" dur="3.42">problem is with other people too is like</text>
  <text start="728.23" dur="3.12">you cannot wait for Trump to just do</text>
  <text start="730.18" dur="3.78">everything for you</text>
  <text start="731.35" dur="4.53">you know you know I understand some</text>
  <text start="733.96" dur="3.57">people have jobs and that&amp;#39;s why I can</text>
  <text start="735.88" dur="4.62">actually do something where like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="737.53" dur="5.04">freed up now especially now that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="740.5" dur="3.57">have a platform but you know it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="742.57" dur="3.18">take matters into your own hands like</text>
  <text start="744.07" dur="4.38">you and on said the people have the</text>
  <text start="745.75" dur="4.2">power you know whether it&amp;#39;s social media</text>
  <text start="748.45" dur="5.31">campaigns spreading information like</text>
  <text start="749.95" dur="5.67">that or a bigger issue like this all</text>
  <text start="753.76" dur="4.86">right well you&amp;#39;ve got me sold let&amp;#39;s do</text>
  <text start="755.62" dur="5.46">this take him down yeah man and you know</text>
  <text start="758.62" dur="4.86">the worst thing that can happen like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="761.08" dur="4.71">talking about the crazy scenario ever</text>
  <text start="763.48" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s you know them trying to dismiss our</text>
  <text start="765.79" dur="3.45">case and then they would appeal us and</text>
  <text start="768.1" dur="4.29">then we would go to the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="769.24" dur="4.8">and at that point it&amp;#39;s like I could hire</text>
  <text start="772.39" dur="3.63">a lawyer but it&amp;#39;s like why wouldn&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="774.04" dur="3.72">just go with Natasha and represent</text>
  <text start="776.02" dur="3.99">myself and appear myself in court</text>
  <text start="777.76" dur="4.32">because once they see me there it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="780.01" dur="3.78">really guys like really Google and</text>
  <text start="782.08" dur="3.96">YouTube like you were seriously doing</text>
  <text start="783.79" dur="4.44">this to this kid like he was starting a</text>
  <text start="786.04" dur="4.77">business and you destroyed him he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="788.23" dur="4.95">for the president and it you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="790.81" dur="4.529">just not they don&amp;#39;t want that it&amp;#39;s a bad</text>
  <text start="793.18" dur="2.42">look for Google and that&amp;#39;s gonna it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="795.339" dur="1.641">going</text>
  <text start="795.6" dur="2.729">and up a political battle and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="796.98" dur="3.45">gonna lose that in the court of public</text>
  <text start="798.329" dur="3.75">opinion well it&amp;#39;s just like the rest of</text>
  <text start="800.43" dur="4.139">the stuff the Democrats are leeching on</text>
  <text start="802.079" dur="4.411">to I mean they were all about daca and</text>
  <text start="804.569" dur="4.26">then once the shooting happen oh let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="806.49" dur="4.5">take the guns you think that&amp;#39;s a popular</text>
  <text start="808.829" dur="4.49">issue what I mean what is the game plan</text>
  <text start="810.99" dur="4.26">here you guys are self-destructing I</text>
  <text start="813.319" dur="3.911">think it was about changing the</text>
  <text start="815.25" dur="3.69">narrative it really seems to be getting</text>
  <text start="817.23" dur="3.99">it out of the corruption issue and on to</text>
  <text start="818.94" dur="4.259">the the gun issue but then oh yeah of</text>
  <text start="821.22" dur="4.14">course I mean forget about forget about</text>
  <text start="823.199" dur="4.291">us forget about our net worth Nancy</text>
  <text start="825.36" dur="4.289">Pelosi what what are you worth we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="827.49" dur="5.55">talking about that yeah because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="829.649" dur="5.93">what I heard that is yeah this moment is</text>
  <text start="833.04" dur="6.18">like literally the zombie from they live</text>
  <text start="835.579" dur="5.111">is a front herself</text>
  <text start="839.22" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s I can&amp;#39;t even keep up with</text>
  <text start="840.69" dur="5.16">everything anymore there&amp;#39;s so much you</text>
  <text start="843.93" dur="3.99">know and that&amp;#39;s why we have to focus on</text>
  <text start="845.85" dur="4.52">our own issues and I would tell the</text>
  <text start="847.92" dur="5.25">folks out there just forget about</text>
  <text start="850.37" dur="4.81">Florida okay forget about it it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="853.17" dur="3.719">not to say that you won&amp;#39;t have it</text>
  <text start="855.18" dur="3.959">resolved I&amp;#39;m just saying</text>
  <text start="856.889" dur="3.781">Trump knows what&amp;#39;s going on and the</text>
  <text start="859.139" dur="2.94">grand scheme of things the truth is</text>
  <text start="860.67" dur="3.71">gonna come out they&amp;#39;re not gonna be able</text>
  <text start="862.079" dur="6.091">to pave over it like they did with Vegas</text>
  <text start="864.38" dur="6.49">you know people die you know people died</text>
  <text start="868.17" dur="5.19">and you should let those people just</text>
  <text start="870.87" dur="6.209">relax all right just relax for a few</text>
  <text start="873.36" dur="4.979">days you know let it let it settle and I</text>
  <text start="877.079" dur="3.541">don&amp;#39;t know if some new evidence comes</text>
  <text start="878.339" dur="3.75">out short but I think what we need to do</text>
  <text start="880.62" dur="4.26">is focus on things like this for</text>
  <text start="882.089" dur="4.891">instance that I&amp;#39;ve see you know the FCC</text>
  <text start="884.88" dur="4.019">might be looking at an antitrust with</text>
  <text start="886.98" dur="3.06">Google and Facebook that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="888.899" dur="3.721">saying why would we waste our time</text>
  <text start="890.04" dur="4.409">talking about this I mean spilt milk</text>
  <text start="892.62" dur="4.079">essentially when we have these real</text>
  <text start="894.449" dur="4.5">issues now that could make a huge</text>
  <text start="896.699" dur="3.87">difference for our free speech free</text>
  <text start="898.949" dur="4.56">speech is the issue especially with</text>
  <text start="900.569" dur="5.221">those do laws we&amp;#39;re trying to pass but I</text>
  <text start="903.509" dur="4.651">will say that I think just like with</text>
  <text start="905.79" dur="3.75">Vegas just like with 9/11 every time</text>
  <text start="908.16" dur="3.21">they use something bad it creates</text>
  <text start="909.54" dur="4.469">distortions and those distortions wake</text>
  <text start="911.37" dur="4.8">people up in mass so oh yeah it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="914.009" dur="4.111">be another illness they can&amp;#39;t keep doing</text>
  <text start="916.17" dur="4.229">this they just can&amp;#39;t they can&amp;#39;t keep</text>
  <text start="918.12" dur="5.159">doing this we find out faster and faster</text>
  <text start="920.399" dur="4.29">that it&amp;#39;s all bs each time and like you</text>
  <text start="923.279" dur="3.651">really think that you know like the</text>
  <text start="924.689" dur="6.151">counter</text>
  <text start="926.93" dur="6.37">hold on glad the you know the</text>
  <text start="930.84" dur="4.53">counter-narrative to us essentially it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="933.3" dur="4.02">like well they&amp;#39;re a bunch of conspiracy</text>
  <text start="935.37" dur="4.59">theories considered like this is</text>
  <text start="937.32" dur="4.53">literally like Anderson Cooper this is</text>
  <text start="939.96" dur="6.33">this is my summer at Anderson Cooper</text>
  <text start="941.85" dur="7.2">conspiracy conspiracy theory bubble it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="946.29" dur="4.56">like dude yeah yeah you know I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="949.05" dur="4.08">like okay if you&amp;#39;re brainwashed you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="950.85" dur="4.56">probably on his side wow these people</text>
  <text start="953.13" dur="4.41">are horrible but if you&amp;#39;re a normal</text>
  <text start="955.41" dur="4.32">person you&amp;#39;re like what&amp;#39;s going on with</text>
  <text start="957.54" dur="4.98">Anderson Cooper like why is he you know</text>
  <text start="959.73" dur="5.37">being so sus like what well what is up</text>
  <text start="962.52" dur="4.68">with this I don&amp;#39;t know if you follow</text>
  <text start="965.1" dur="4.65">Molyneux but one of my favorite quotes</text>
  <text start="967.2" dur="4.94">or expressions is from stefan molyneux</text>
  <text start="969.75" dur="4.41">and it&amp;#39;s basically not an argument and</text>
  <text start="972.14" dur="3.82">conspiracy theory is just not an</text>
  <text start="974.16" dur="4.74">argument it&amp;#39;s oh of course</text>
  <text start="975.96" dur="4.56">and you know like they try to that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="978.9" dur="3.48">what the allocation was essentially</text>
  <text start="980.52" dur="3.78">fighting the war by himself for a year</text>
  <text start="982.38" dur="3.57">all right angry what they tried to do</text>
  <text start="984.3" dur="2.43">even back in the day is oh he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="985.95" dur="2.61">conspiracy</text>
  <text start="986.73" dur="4.2">did that stop him from doing what he was</text>
  <text start="988.56" dur="4.17">doing no it actually it&amp;#39;s strengthened</text>
  <text start="990.93" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s it yeah it strengthened his base</text>
  <text start="992.73" dur="4.26">and it created a Streisand effect which</text>
  <text start="994.68" dur="4.11">is I know it&amp;#39;s probably happening to you</text>
  <text start="996.99" dur="3.78">I see it happening to me it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="998.79" dur="3.93">actually bananas what&amp;#39;s happened because</text>
  <text start="1000.77" dur="3.21">if the pan yeah</text>
  <text start="1002.72" dur="2.73">well I&amp;#39;ve still got all these people</text>
  <text start="1003.98" dur="3.33">that don&amp;#39;t know where to find me but</text>
  <text start="1005.45" dur="5.01">other than that I think the people that</text>
  <text start="1007.31" dur="6.36">have found me are concerned at least</text>
  <text start="1010.46" dur="5.46">about what happened and only it only</text>
  <text start="1013.67" dur="4.08">makes us look more credible I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1015.92" dur="3.15">obviously telling the truth but people</text>
  <text start="1017.75" dur="2.94">that are on the fence are gonna be</text>
  <text start="1019.07" dur="4.62">looking at this and thinking wow this</text>
  <text start="1020.69" dur="4.89">this might actually be legit yeah of</text>
  <text start="1023.69" dur="4.2">course and if we take legal action like</text>
  <text start="1025.58" dur="4.08">like I said the worst that can happen is</text>
  <text start="1027.89" dur="4.38">I mean they can&amp;#39;t really do anything to</text>
  <text start="1029.66" dur="3.93">us bro it&amp;#39;s not like they can uh you</text>
  <text start="1032.27" dur="4.29">know what are they gonna do arrest me</text>

  <text start="1042.59" dur="4.71">documented evidence it&amp;#39;s public record</text>
  <text start="1044.66" dur="4.14">about all these patents I can show that</text>
  <text start="1047.3" dur="3.48">Google is working with the government</text>
  <text start="1048.8" dur="3.66">that essentially makes my case for free</text>
  <text start="1050.78" dur="4.11">speech because the government is</text>
  <text start="1052.46" dur="3.99">supposed to provide you free speech so</text>
  <text start="1054.89" dur="3.39">the government goes and creates these</text>

  <text start="1487.47" dur="4.29">this back and and with cue waking up so</text>
  <text start="1489.99" dur="4.53">many more people and and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1491.76" dur="4.38">starting to learn and they&amp;#39;re learning a</text>
  <text start="1494.52" dur="3.24">lot faster than I did it took me years</text>
  <text start="1496.14" dur="3.66">to get ahold of some of this stuff and</text>
  <text start="1497.76" dur="4.77">now they&amp;#39;re just like on the fast track</text>
  <text start="1499.8" dur="4.47">with cue and on so well that&amp;#39;s why cue</text>
  <text start="1502.53" dur="3.27">is great because you know if you wanted</text>
  <text start="1504.27" dur="3.21">to learn how the world really worked</text>
  <text start="1505.8" dur="4.29">looking to cue and on because he&amp;#39;s got</text>

  <text start="1510.09" dur="4.02">about or you know if you were curious</text>
  <text start="1511.92" dur="4.02">about a certain thing or it you know is</text>
  <text start="1514.11" dur="3.69">the government really watching us well I</text>
  <text start="1515.94" dur="4.62">would say research cueing on and you</text>
  <text start="1517.8" dur="4.92">might find out yeah and and every</text>
  <text start="1520.56" dur="5.16">private company basically out there is</text>
  <text start="1522.72" dur="4.98">watching us as well they are all doing</text>
  <text start="1525.72" dur="4.32">the back door programs and selling our</text>
  <text start="1527.7" dur="4.23">information left and right but you know</text>
  <text start="1530.04" dur="4.08">Trump is in charge we got the white hats</text>
  <text start="1531.93" dur="4.65">behind us obviously you see the FTC is</text>
  <text start="1534.12" dur="4.32">making moves for antitrust I would be</text>
  <text start="1536.58" dur="4.5">you know it&amp;#39;d be surprising to see</text>
  <text start="1538.44" dur="4.43">Google and Facebook not being broken up</text>
  <text start="1541.08" dur="4.74">because as I explained in the beginning</text>
  <text start="1542.87" dur="4.9">seventy percent of web traffic the US</text>
  <text start="1545.82" dur="5.61">government only owns 20 percent of the</text>
  <text start="1547.77" dur="6.72">land which is way too much I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1551.43" dur="5.79">all I&amp;#39;m saying man you know they they</text>
  <text start="1554.49" dur="5.73">own practically all of the internet it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1557.22" dur="4.83">not it comes back in in sort of a</text>
  <text start="1560.22" dur="4.17">surreal way it comes back to the greater</text>
  <text start="1562.05" dur="4.98">the greater story of this whole economic</text>
  <text start="1564.39" dur="5.97">war between communism and capitalism and</text>
  <text start="1567.03" dur="5.85">this whole concept of competition which</text>
  <text start="1570.36" dur="5.31">bad people hate they really hate that</text>
  <text start="1572.88" dur="4.59">word and that&amp;#39;s the most beautiful thing</text>
  <text start="1575.67" dur="3.48">for mankind as a whole because it gives</text>
  <text start="1577.47" dur="4.65">us options it gives us better prices</text>
  <text start="1579.15" dur="5.07">better quality it just competitions a</text>
  <text start="1582.12" dur="5.43">wonderful thing and and monopolies are</text>
  <text start="1584.22" dur="5.79">not good you know it&amp;#39;s well said Justin</text>
  <text start="1587.55" dur="4.35">and what really competition does is it</text>
  <text start="1590.01" dur="4.29">brings excellence and it brings the</text>
  <text start="1591.9" dur="4.32">cream of the crop to the top and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1594.3" dur="4.2">and that&amp;#39;s what America has always been</text>
  <text start="1596.22" dur="4.17">about is competition and trying to be</text>
  <text start="1598.5" dur="3.84">you know back in the day back in</text>
  <text start="1600.39" dur="4.26">America&amp;#39;s heyday we were number one man</text>
  <text start="1602.34" dur="4.11">and we were being stomped on by the</text>
