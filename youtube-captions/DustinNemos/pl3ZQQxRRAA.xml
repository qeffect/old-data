  <text start="10.45" dur="8.3">back by the most powerful force that is</text>
  <text start="29.45" dur="5.11">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="31.95" dur="5.24">most of the Nemo&amp;#39;s news network and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="34.56" dur="5.76">joined once again by David Steffen a</text>
  <text start="37.19" dur="5.049">Canadian father and parent who lost a</text>
  <text start="40.32" dur="4.65">child and then was attacked by the</text>
  <text start="42.239" dur="3.931">system for maliciousness where he was</text>
  <text start="44.97" dur="3.81">only trying to do the right thing</text>
  <text start="46.17" dur="5.19">finally vindicated at the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="48.78" dur="4.05">level if I&amp;#39;m not mistaken and then now</text>
  <text start="51.36" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re trying to appeal it and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="52.83" dur="4.08">usually an usual leftist tactics and</text>
  <text start="54.57" dur="4.8">sort of big pharma esque tactics of</text>
  <text start="56.91" dur="4.71">intimidation and bullying and that so</text>
  <text start="59.37" dur="4.32">David I think I got all of that right</text>
  <text start="61.62" dur="3.749">please correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="63.69" dur="3.3">gonna let you have the floor to tell us</text>
  <text start="65.369" dur="3.271">what&amp;#39;s happening because you know you</text>
  <text start="66.99" dur="3.15">you guys are neighbors to the north we</text>
  <text start="68.64" dur="4.14">have a lot of Canadians in our audience</text>
  <text start="70.14" dur="5.479">this is very scary even if you know</text>
  <text start="72.78" dur="4.89">you&amp;#39;re not necessarily in Canada</text>
  <text start="75.619" dur="4.631">absolutely and thank you very much for</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="6.18">having me on Dustin yeah just one one</text>
  <text start="80.25" dur="5.57">point of correction just that people see</text>
  <text start="83.85" dur="5.129">everything clearly is we were vindicated</text>
  <text start="85.82" dur="4.81">at the Supreme Court level of Canada but</text>
  <text start="88.979" dur="3.391">what they did is they turned it back for</text>
  <text start="90.63" dur="4.05">a retrial because they said the initial</text>
  <text start="92.37" dur="5.67">trial that sent me to jail was wrong and</text>
  <text start="94.68" dur="5.85">so we just went through that retrial in</text>
  <text start="98.04" dur="4.65">the Superior Court of Alberta or</text>
  <text start="100.53" dur="5.339">otherwise known as Alberta Queen&amp;#39;s Bench</text>
  <text start="102.69" dur="5.82">Court of Queen&amp;#39;s Bench and we we just</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="5.761">won that case on the 19th of September</text>
  <text start="108.51" dur="5.429">and that that was a huge victory because</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="4.23">our case was a massive precedent-setting</text>
  <text start="113.939" dur="4.411">case here in Canada is actually the</text>
  <text start="115.86" dur="4.38">first of its kind yeah where what they</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="3.269">were doing was applying these charges of</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="3.989">failing to provide the necessaries of</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="4.261">life to parents that are loving caring</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="3">and attentive and that&amp;#39;s evidence I came</text>
  <text start="125.88" dur="2.73">out in the in the court that I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="3.39">trying to puff myself up that was</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="3.2">actually what one of the judges stated</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="4.171">actually to the different judges</text>
  <text start="131.81" dur="6.79">deliberation of six and half years had</text>
  <text start="134.79" dur="6.36">stated and so what was identified it was</text>
  <text start="138.6" dur="4.41">a matter of choice of care and so what</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="4.53">they were using this case for was an</text>
  <text start="143.01" dur="4.77">attack on natural medicine as well as to</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="4.83">try to push through a vaccine precedent</text>
  <text start="147.78" dur="6.27">here in Canada and so it was a major</text>
  <text start="150.51" dur="7.559">victory that we just had here in Canada</text>
  <text start="154.05" dur="4.87">and I can tell you the the powers that</text>
  <text start="158.069" dur="3.881">be are</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="5.91">not happy at all with what took place</text>
  <text start="161.95" dur="4.32">you know and then I&amp;#39;m so glad that you</text>
  <text start="164.83" dur="4.11">guys were able to pull this off at least</text>
  <text start="166.27" dur="4.5">to date I mean and good luck continuing</text>
  <text start="168.94" dur="4.47">on congratulations on what you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="170.77" dur="4.8">accomplished this is a hero&amp;#39;s journey I</text>
  <text start="173.41" dur="4.08">guess but you know you&amp;#39;re standing up to</text>
  <text start="175.57" dur="3.63">a very powerful system and there are</text>
  <text start="177.49" dur="3.96">people that are clearly you know my</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="4.17">opinion bought off that are sort of you</text>
  <text start="181.45" dur="4.2">know championing their cause and and</text>
  <text start="183.37" dur="4.19">always seeming to just go after people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="185.65" dur="4.53">rights to try to push things on people</text>
  <text start="187.56" dur="3.97">and and I think you could speak to that</text>
  <text start="190.18" dur="3.54">in your own case and your own personal</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="5.22">experience as well but you know what</text>
  <text start="193.72" dur="5.04">what what is going on with the pushback</text>
  <text start="196.75" dur="4.98">against this what kind of forces are or</text>
  <text start="198.76" dur="5.49">railed against you from the I guess the</text>
  <text start="201.73" dur="4.41">governmental side the health you know</text>
  <text start="204.25" dur="4.86">whatever your health canada i think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.14" dur="5.34">called you know your officials and also</text>
  <text start="209.11" dur="4.129">the the big pharma industry and others</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="4.44">like you know maybe medical</text>
  <text start="213.239" dur="4.081">professionals that may be coming against</text>
  <text start="215.92" dur="3.18">you tell us about that</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="5.74">absolutely yeah we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="219.1" dur="5.91">pushback since the the victory in regard</text>
  <text start="223.06" dur="4.41">to health canada the only thing that</text>
  <text start="225.01" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;ve seen with them getting involved in</text>
  <text start="227.47" dur="4.049">this case was during the investigation</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="4.14">seven years ago just over seven years</text>
  <text start="231.519" dur="5.551">ago they had their fingerprints on it</text>
  <text start="233.89" dur="5.58">the police hadn&amp;#39;t received an inquiry</text>
  <text start="237.07" dur="3.72">from a health canada agent surrounding</text>
  <text start="239.47" dur="4.89">the investigation of the death of my son</text>
  <text start="240.79" dur="5.4">and so that&amp;#39;s the only thing that the</text>
  <text start="244.36" dur="4.409">only fingerprint that we have of them</text>
  <text start="246.19" dur="4.38">thus far but in regard to the whole</text>
  <text start="248.769" dur="3.391">vaccine precedent trying to be push to</text>
  <text start="250.57" dur="3.389">the courts we can only suspect that that</text>
  <text start="252.16" dur="4.859">came from the federal level through that</text>
  <text start="253.959" dur="5.701">governing body but what took place to</text>
  <text start="257.019" dur="5.181">this victory just to give context as to</text>
  <text start="259.66" dur="5.46">what what opposition we&amp;#39;re seeing now is</text>
  <text start="262.2" dur="6.48">it was deem that my son died due to</text>
  <text start="265.12" dur="6">hypoxic injury from oxygen deprivation</text>
  <text start="268.68" dur="5.02">because the ambulance had been</text>
  <text start="271.12" dur="5.01">proactively d stocked of the the</text>
  <text start="273.7" dur="6.42">necessary equipment and our ambulance</text>
  <text start="276.13" dur="7.77">services are governed by the provinces</text>
  <text start="280.12" dur="5.16">so it&amp;#39;s a state agency and so there was</text>
  <text start="283.9" dur="4.019">a major cover-up around that and then</text>
  <text start="285.28" dur="4.62">there was a whole narrative that was</text>
  <text start="287.919" dur="3.271">developed about bacterial meningitis and</text>
  <text start="289.9" dur="2.7">he would have had these symptoms and</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="3.45">were negligent as parents and</text>
  <text start="292.6" dur="4.83">to paint this picture so all of that was</text>
  <text start="294.64" dur="4.14">wiped away and it was identified that</text>
  <text start="297.43" dur="3.81">our son never had bacterial meningitis</text>
  <text start="298.78" dur="3.96">he didn&amp;#39;t die from meningitis meningitis</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="4.37">didn&amp;#39;t cause him to need an ambulance</text>
  <text start="302.74" dur="5.28">but he ends up in this ambulance</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="3.55">requiring intubation equipment and they</text>
  <text start="308.02" dur="3.69">didn&amp;#39;t have it so he went eight and a</text>
  <text start="309.16" dur="4.41">half minutes without oxygen so that was</text>
  <text start="311.71" dur="5.27">deemed the cause of death through this</text>
  <text start="313.57" dur="6.66">last trial and so what&amp;#39;s of interest is</text>
  <text start="316.98" dur="5.65">the parties that are involved being</text>
  <text start="320.23" dur="3.6">Alberta Health Services they&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="322.63" dur="3.87">lot of skin in the game and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.83" dur="4.56">concerned about the ramifications of</text>
  <text start="326.5" dur="3.42">this and in fact with any one of their</text>
  <text start="328.39" dur="2.85">witnesses that came forward or almost</text>
  <text start="329.92" dur="4.68">any one of their witnesses I think there</text>
  <text start="331.24" dur="4.71">was one one or two possibly Alberta</text>
  <text start="334.6" dur="3.87">Health Services employees that showed up</text>
  <text start="335.95" dur="4.77">to the case that didn&amp;#39;t have a lawyer in</text>
  <text start="338.47" dur="4.74">attendance with them but all the rest of</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="4.74">their witnesses had a civil lawyer</text>
  <text start="343.21" dur="3.66">present to try to help guide them</text>
  <text start="345.46" dur="3.27">through the process so they didn&amp;#39;t open</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="5.43">themselves up to a massive lawsuit that</text>
  <text start="348.73" dur="6.45">they know what&amp;#39;s coming and so since the</text>
  <text start="352.3" dur="4.71">victory out of the University of Calgary</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="3.9">which is attached to Alberta Children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.01" dur="5.64">Hospital which is where a lot of this</text>
  <text start="359.08" dur="7.05">untoward stuff took place regarding the</text>
  <text start="362.65" dur="5.88">death of my son there&amp;#39;s a professor by</text>
  <text start="366.13" dur="4.71">the name of Julia Keshawn now she&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="368.53" dur="4.59">major major player in fact someone</text>
  <text start="370.84" dur="4.65">deemed her to be a professional activist</text>
  <text start="373.12" dur="6.12">that&amp;#39;s exactly what she is a paid</text>
  <text start="375.49" dur="6.75">activist to push certain certain</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="6.63">corporate agendas through so currently</text>
  <text start="382.24" dur="6.45">she&amp;#39;s pushing fluoride backing to the</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="5.27">water she&amp;#39;s on that agenda in Calgary</text>
  <text start="388.69" dur="5.94">because they removed it she is</text>
  <text start="391.14" dur="8.05">attempting to to get vaping removed so</text>
  <text start="394.63" dur="7.14">in favor of big tobacco and she also has</text>
  <text start="399.19" dur="5.43">a history in the vaccine world in</text>
  <text start="401.77" dur="5.97">ramming the vaccine agenda through so</text>
  <text start="404.62" dur="5.67">back and I believe it&amp;#39;s 2011 she pushed</text>
  <text start="407.74" dur="4.59">the vaccine the HPV vaccine into</text>
  <text start="410.29" dur="4.53">thirteen different school boards that</text>
  <text start="412.33" dur="4.38">didn&amp;#39;t want to carry it for moral</text>
  <text start="414.82" dur="4.53">reasons it was a Catholic the Catholic</text>
  <text start="416.71" dur="4.11">school boards and so she was successful</text>
  <text start="419.35" dur="3.42">in doing that and she she ended up</text>
  <text start="420.82" dur="4.23">winning the public health hero award of</text>
  <text start="422.77" dur="3.58">Canada for doing so so what&amp;#39;s of</text>
  <text start="425.05" dur="4.42">interest is</text>
  <text start="426.35" dur="5.34">after this victory she&amp;#39;s seen on</text>
  <text start="429.47" dur="3.75">numerous news articles saying the judge</text>
  <text start="431.69" dur="3.99">was wrong the judge is wrong the judge</text>
  <text start="433.22" dur="4.92">is wrong so she&amp;#39;s fuming about it well a</text>
  <text start="435.68" dur="5.64">couple days later all of a sudden there</text>
  <text start="438.14" dur="6.3">is this document that&amp;#39;s submitted to the</text>
  <text start="441.32" dur="7.2">Canadian Judicial Council making claims</text>
  <text start="444.44" dur="7.68">that the judge was racist and the reason</text>
  <text start="448.52" dur="5.01">why is because the first medical</text>
  <text start="452.12" dur="4.08">examiner that took a look at my son who</text>
  <text start="453.53" dur="4.68">said it was bacterial meningitis vaccine</text>
  <text start="456.2" dur="4.11">preventible who really laid the</text>
  <text start="458.21" dur="5.25">foundations for this whole agenda to</text>
  <text start="460.31" dur="6.78">move forward his evidence had no</text>
  <text start="463.46" dur="5.61">scientific backing to it and so he it</text>
  <text start="467.09" dur="4.35">was of Nigerian descent so he&amp;#39;s black</text>
  <text start="469.07" dur="5.31">and he speaks in a very strong Nigerian</text>
  <text start="471.44" dur="5.55">accent and so he was hard to understand</text>
  <text start="474.38" dur="5.31">and so we had brought that forward as a</text>
  <text start="476.99" dur="4.02">defense saying you need to take this</text>
  <text start="479.69" dur="2.55">into consideration as to the weight of</text>
  <text start="481.01" dur="3.3">his evidence that we can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="482.24" dur="4.11">understand his evidence so how can this</text>
  <text start="484.31" dur="6.45">be used in court against us or for us</text>
  <text start="486.35" dur="5.82">and so he addressed those concerns as to</text>
  <text start="490.76" dur="3.87">whether or not he&amp;#39;d be qualified as an</text>
  <text start="492.17" dur="4.02">expert witness and he qualified him</text>
  <text start="494.63" dur="3.15">ultimately as an expert witness but said</text>
  <text start="496.19" dur="3.57">it would just merely go to the weight of</text>
  <text start="497.78" dur="3.78">his evidence and so he addressed our</text>
  <text start="499.76" dur="5.16">concerns in his decision which was his</text>
  <text start="501.56" dur="5.94">duty to do so but because he identified</text>
  <text start="504.92" dur="5.01">that it was in fact hard to understand</text>
  <text start="507.5" dur="5.28">his evidence and that that went to the</text>
  <text start="509.93" dur="4.98">weight who now what the this party was</text>
  <text start="512.78" dur="4.77">claiming 42 different people signed this</text>
  <text start="514.91" dur="6.33">document they were claiming that he was</text>
  <text start="517.55" dur="6.27">racist now of interest there was three</text>
  <text start="521.24" dur="5.61">listed authors of the document the main</text>
  <text start="523.82" dur="5.13">one was Juliet Keshawn the same</text>
  <text start="526.85" dur="4.95">individual who&amp;#39;s been chasing this this</text>
  <text start="528.95" dur="5.73">agenda down all along and so it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="531.8" dur="6.27">really really interesting to see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.68" dur="5.13">been taking place subsequently the crown</text>
  <text start="538.07" dur="4.86">is now appealed and they really</text>
  <text start="539.81" dur="5.49">springboarded off of those racist claims</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="4.62">that that went to national news all over</text>
  <text start="545.3" dur="5.4">Canada is judged absolutely just getting</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="4.68">hammered over it and so now the the</text>
  <text start="550.7" dur="3.51">Crown&amp;#39;s taking advantage of that they</text>
  <text start="552.23" dur="6.15">kind of laid the foundation for the</text>
  <text start="554.21" dur="5.67">public being acceptant of an appeal even</text>
  <text start="558.38" dur="4.59">though we&amp;#39;re now looking at</text>
  <text start="559.88" dur="5.31">seven plus years of investigation and</text>
  <text start="562.97" dur="6.54">court proceedings taking place taxpayers</text>
  <text start="565.19" dur="6.71">money funding this whole ordeal and just</text>
  <text start="569.51" dur="6.33">really really just a waste of resources</text>
  <text start="571.9" dur="7.3">and yet they are pushing forward still</text>
  <text start="575.84" dur="5.16">to try to have us convicted and to have</text>
  <text start="579.2" dur="3.9">the precedent that was set during this</text>
  <text start="581" dur="4.35">case overturned which was actually</text>
  <text start="583.1" dur="4.86">really fantastic precedent if you want</text>
  <text start="585.35" dur="4.14">me to go into that I would love to and</text>
  <text start="587.96" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;m sorry that you guys have to go</text>
  <text start="589.49" dur="5.88">through so much of this BS from these</text>
  <text start="592.4" dur="4.38">powers you know what else could they be</text>
  <text start="595.37" dur="3.18">called they&amp;#39;re just coming out of the</text>
  <text start="596.78" dur="3.36">shadows to attack you for for no</text>
  <text start="598.55" dur="3.33">apparent reason I mean what how did</text>
  <text start="600.14" dur="3.96">racism even enter into this conversation</text>
  <text start="601.88" dur="4.35">this was a an entirely different issue</text>
  <text start="604.1" dur="4.14">and then suddenly oh we don&amp;#39;t like what</text>
  <text start="606.23" dur="4.44">your your verdict was so you&amp;#39;re a racist</text>
  <text start="608.24" dur="4.35">I mean I would laugh but I also feel</text>
  <text start="610.67" dur="4.2">really badly for you you know so please</text>
  <text start="612.59" dur="4.02">go into the precedent yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="614.87" dur="3.03">disturbing it&amp;#39;s disturbing that we live</text>
  <text start="616.61" dur="3.9">in a society that that would actually</text>
  <text start="617.9" dur="3.87">have traction you didn&amp;#39;t I just want to</text>
  <text start="620.51" dur="2.7">say I have great respect for what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="621.77" dur="3.06">doing I really do it takes people like</text>
  <text start="623.21" dur="3.54">you standing up to the system to make</text>
  <text start="624.83" dur="5.07">things like this happen so so thank you</text>
  <text start="626.75" dur="4.59">and I know it&amp;#39;s not much well you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="629.9" dur="2.97">welcome and to be honest with you I</text>
  <text start="631.34" dur="3.26">would I would have rather just rolled</text>
  <text start="632.87" dur="4.35">over a long time ago and just you know</text>
  <text start="634.6" dur="4.36">taken the the plea bargain or whatever</text>
  <text start="637.22" dur="3.66">that they you know back in the day and</text>
  <text start="638.96" dur="3.12">it would have been a lot easier but</text>
  <text start="640.88" dur="4.62">knowing that this was a</text>
  <text start="642.08" dur="5.88">precedent-setting case I felt yeah the</text>
  <text start="645.5" dur="5.64">need to have to move forward so nothing</text>
  <text start="647.96" dur="5.4">heroic here just doing what I felt</text>
  <text start="651.14" dur="3.87">needed to be done rather than taking the</text>
  <text start="653.36" dur="4.86">easy road out and so and my wife&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="655.01" dur="4.77">the same mindset and so I yeah I&amp;#39;m glad</text>
  <text start="658.22" dur="3.6">I have a strong wife that stands behind</text>
  <text start="659.78" dur="3.42">me on my staff heroic you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="661.82" dur="3.3">not many people that do that most people</text>
  <text start="663.2" dur="3.75">take the easy way out so this this</text>
  <text start="665.12" dur="3.54">precedent though if it stands I mean</text>
  <text start="666.95" dur="3.27">what this this kind of messes up their</text>
  <text start="668.66" dur="5.13">system a little bit for tax people that</text>
  <text start="670.22" dur="6">don&amp;#39;t want to plug in right hugely and</text>
  <text start="673.79" dur="5.04">so what they were attempting to do the</text>
  <text start="676.22" dur="4.86">first case and they were they were able</text>
  <text start="678.83" dur="5.31">to actually achieve it is to basically</text>
  <text start="681.08" dur="5.58">establish that if you don&amp;#39;t utilize the</text>
  <text start="684.14" dur="3.87">medical system you know I will politic</text>
  <text start="686.66" dur="5.58">medicine if that&amp;#39;s not your first choice</text>
  <text start="688.01" dur="5.35">then you are in risk of criminal</text>
  <text start="692.24" dur="4.45">liability</text>
  <text start="693.36" dur="4.669">if something happens and so you know</text>
  <text start="696.69" dur="4.47">just to put it out there you know</text>
  <text start="698.029" dur="4.99">medicine does have a place in in some</text>
  <text start="701.16" dur="3.78">instances right emergency medicine right</text>
  <text start="703.019" dur="4.5">so if I if I broke my leg and you know</text>
  <text start="704.94" dur="4.23">shattered it I wouldn&amp;#39;t be going out to</text>
  <text start="707.519" dur="3.781">the forest here and grabbing a bunch of</text>
  <text start="709.17" dur="3.659">leaves to wrap it up right I would be</text>
  <text start="711.3" dur="3.75">going getting probably a surgery as</text>
  <text start="712.829" dur="3.811">necessary at that moment and then I</text>
  <text start="715.05" dur="3.33">would then go get some comfrey leaves or</text>
  <text start="716.64" dur="3.15">whatever you know you utilize whatever</text>
  <text start="718.38" dur="2.94">natural treatments to help rebuild the</text>
  <text start="719.79" dur="6.38">connective tissue roll out so whatever</text>
  <text start="721.32" dur="6.6">so medicine does have a place but</text>
  <text start="726.17" dur="5.08">basically the precedent that they were</text>
  <text start="727.92" dur="5.159">attempting to set is that look if if</text>
  <text start="731.25" dur="4.29">doctors are not your first choice of</text>
  <text start="733.079" dur="4.111">care then you&amp;#39;re negligent as a parent</text>
  <text start="735.54" dur="3.72">and we&amp;#39;re gonna hold you liable for it</text>
  <text start="737.19" dur="3.72">and so what they were able to achieve in</text>
  <text start="739.26" dur="4.74">the first case that the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="740.91" dur="5.85">overturned is that if you if they deem</text>
  <text start="744" dur="6.24">that you have endangered your child&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="746.76" dur="6.18">life at a time that medical intervention</text>
  <text start="750.24" dur="4.71">could have not would have that was</text>
  <text start="752.94" dur="4.98">actually the specific wording could have</text>
  <text start="754.95" dur="5.879">not would have made a difference then</text>
  <text start="757.92" dur="5.52">you should be held firmly liable and so</text>
  <text start="760.829" dur="4.32">they found us guilty on that and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="763.44" dur="3.3">what the Supreme Court overturned was</text>
  <text start="765.149" dur="3.69">saying this whole charge that was given</text>
  <text start="766.74" dur="4.589">to the jury left the jury with no choice</text>
  <text start="768.839" dur="4.141">but to find us guilty right they had no</text>
  <text start="771.329" dur="3.601">choice and it&amp;#39;s not because we were</text>
  <text start="772.98" dur="4.02">guilty it&amp;#39;s because there was no</text>
  <text start="774.93" dur="5.07">alternative option in weighing the</text>
  <text start="777" dur="5.459">evidence it&amp;#39;s and so it was overturned</text>
  <text start="780" dur="4.38">and what came out of this case</text>
  <text start="782.459" dur="5.011">was really good because we argued the</text>
  <text start="784.38" dur="4.98">elements of the crown had to prove for</text>
  <text start="787.47" dur="4.53">them to be able to convict other parents</text>
  <text start="789.36" dur="4.95">and so rather than these charges being</text>
  <text start="792" dur="5.699">really ambiguous they were particular</text>
  <text start="794.31" dur="5.639">eyes and and the crown now has to in</text>
  <text start="797.699" dur="3.33">detail make sure that they cover off</text>
  <text start="799.949" dur="2.851">these certain elements so it went</text>
  <text start="801.029" dur="4.68">through four elements to nine elements</text>
  <text start="802.8" dur="4.89">that the crown had to prove that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="805.709" dur="4.921">this case set forth and one of those</text>
  <text start="807.69" dur="7.56">elements elements X is that they have to</text>
  <text start="810.63" dur="6.899">prove the crown that by taking a child</text>
  <text start="815.25" dur="4.98">in that it would have actually made a</text>
  <text start="817.529" dur="4.891">difference hence I&amp;#39;m substantiating it</text>
  <text start="820.23" dur="3.419">being a necessary of life because if it</text>
  <text start="822.42" dur="4.08">doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="823.649" dur="3.68">necessary right it has to be something</text>
  <text start="826.5" dur="2.149">that you know</text>
  <text start="827.329" dur="2.94">have done it not just like something</text>
  <text start="828.649" dur="4.56">they could have maybe she had a fever</text>
  <text start="830.269" dur="4.44">maybe and it was a freak thing and it</text>
  <text start="833.209" dur="3.57">was bad and then you could have taken</text>
  <text start="834.709" dur="4.261">some hardcore drug that would have</text>
  <text start="836.779" dur="4.92">helped but you didn&amp;#39;t you chose to take</text>
  <text start="838.97" dur="4.5">something that was natural and and and</text>
  <text start="841.699" dur="3.93">suddenly you&amp;#39;re like a criminal parent</text>
  <text start="843.47" dur="5.519">which murdered your child and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="845.629" dur="4.89">insane exactly yeah and that&amp;#39;s that the</text>
  <text start="848.989" dur="3.6">place that it was putting parents in</text>
  <text start="850.519" dur="3.151">right and and it didn&amp;#39;t your child</text>
  <text start="852.589" dur="3.03">doesn&amp;#39;t have to die either</text>
  <text start="853.67" dur="3.87">lots of think that it&amp;#39;s endangerment</text>
  <text start="855.619" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s not even death and so they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="857.54" dur="3.18">approve causation of death and they did</text>
  <text start="859.309" dur="3.99">that for a reason with our case because</text>
  <text start="860.72" dur="3.119">the others do it then they steal your</text>
  <text start="863.299" dur="2.97">child</text>
  <text start="863.839" dur="3.93">next if you have a child that is just a</text>
  <text start="866.269" dur="2.641">danger then they just use it against you</text>
  <text start="867.769" dur="4.23">and then they take your child into a</text>
  <text start="868.91" dur="5.909">system that abuses them so exactly whole</text>
  <text start="871.999" dur="4.8">nother conversation but yeah yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="874.819" dur="4.02">exactly a whole nother conversation but</text>
  <text start="876.799" dur="4.02">very very relevant in highlighting the</text>
  <text start="878.839" dur="3.42">double standard that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing a</text>
  <text start="880.819" dur="3.27">lot of that here in Canada and all you</text>
  <text start="882.259" dur="4.62">guys have going on in the states where</text>
  <text start="884.089" dur="4.891">the foster care system is is a system of</text>
  <text start="886.879" dur="4.17">endangerment and yes there&amp;#39;s good foster</text>
  <text start="888.98" dur="4.56">foster parents out there but the system</text>
  <text start="891.049" dur="4.89">as a whole is extremely broken and and</text>
  <text start="893.54" dur="4.799">there&amp;#39;s a lot of harm you&amp;#39;re in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="895.939" dur="4.44">at least we&amp;#39;re having it almost</text>
  <text start="898.339" dur="4.11">industrial level child trafficking being</text>
  <text start="900.379" dur="4.351">enabled by the child protective services</text>
  <text start="902.449" dur="4.38">and you know we&amp;#39;ve had GOP people come</text>
  <text start="904.73" dur="4.859">out and say similar statements recently</text>
  <text start="906.829" dur="4.021">we&amp;#39;ve had some people die even you know</text>
  <text start="909.589" dur="3.48">former senators and things in that</text>
  <text start="910.85" dur="4.529">nature looking into this issue and I</text>
  <text start="913.069" dur="4.471">know that recently there was a big bust</text>
  <text start="915.379" dur="4.62">in Canada as well of like human</text>
  <text start="917.54" dur="4.979">traffickers and stocks that were no just</text>
  <text start="919.999" dur="4.65">large numbers of children so things like</text>
  <text start="922.519" dur="4.5">that you know it starts with a supply</text>
  <text start="924.649" dur="4.92">system and when you get kids except for</text>
  <text start="927.019" dur="4.5">you know those who&amp;#39;ve run away or been</text>
  <text start="929.569" dur="5.43">abandoned by the system or just another</text>
  <text start="931.519" dur="5.141">statistic so it&amp;#39;s an unfortunate Society</text>
  <text start="934.999" dur="3.46">but</text>
  <text start="936.66" dur="3.239">absolutely and actually just to</text>
  <text start="938.459" dur="3.661">highlight I&amp;#39;m gonna be sharing my</text>
  <text start="939.899" dur="4.231">Facebook the situation pretty soon here</text>
  <text start="942.12" dur="3.63">but you know to really highlight the</text>
  <text start="944.13" dur="3.629">double standard there because you know</text>
  <text start="945.75" dur="4.199">some people be watching this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="947.759" dur="3.75">like well you know surely you couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="949.949" dur="3.841">done more for your child or this is that</text>
  <text start="951.509" dur="4.5">well hindsight you can always look back</text>
  <text start="953.79" dur="4.2">and say that right that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a given</text>
  <text start="956.009" dur="3.45">but but even in our situation it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="957.99" dur="3">quite hazy because the amount of cover</text>
  <text start="959.459" dur="3.601">abuts taking place with the evidence</text>
  <text start="960.99" dur="3.81">that we still don&amp;#39;t know what caused my</text>
  <text start="963.06" dur="3.089">son to go into cardiac arrest or</text>
  <text start="964.8" dur="4.56">respiratory arrest and need that</text>
  <text start="966.149" dur="5.521">ambulance we&amp;#39;re pretty pretty sure what</text>
  <text start="969.36" dur="3.419">it is but we haven&amp;#39;t been able to get</text>
  <text start="971.67" dur="2.43">all the evidence there&amp;#39;s still a lot of</text>
  <text start="972.779" dur="5.761">missing evidence in the case</text>
  <text start="974.1" dur="7.799">but what&amp;#39;s of interest is you know some</text>
  <text start="978.54" dur="5.88">people still operate under this illusion</text>
  <text start="981.899" dur="6.781">that the crown is there to ensure</text>
  <text start="984.42" dur="6.24">justice to make sure that people you</text>
  <text start="988.68" dur="3.779">know that are criminals go to jail too</text>
  <text start="990.66" dur="4.02">as a deterrent to prevent more crimes</text>
  <text start="992.459" dur="4.171">from occurring and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="994.68" dur="3.63">because I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of people that</text>
  <text start="996.63" dur="4.23">have had issues with the foster care</text>
  <text start="998.31" dur="4.74">system reach out who have had deaths</text>
  <text start="1000.86" dur="4.74">occur with their children from the</text>
  <text start="1003.05" dur="5.039">foster care system and yet the crown and</text>
  <text start="1005.6" dur="4.5">the RCMP the police a federal police are</text>
  <text start="1008.089" dur="4.98">turning a blind eye to it and so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1010.1" dur="6.03">one particular case that I&amp;#39;m quite well</text>
  <text start="1013.069" dur="8.431">aware of no the mom and the grandmother</text>
  <text start="1016.13" dur="7.319">fairly good and what it is where the</text>
  <text start="1021.5" dur="6.179">Child Protective Services came in and</text>
  <text start="1023.449" dur="6.24">they came into this home for this this</text>
  <text start="1027.679" dur="3.691">mother with her other children so</text>
  <text start="1029.689" dur="3.9">there&amp;#39;s two mothers living in the home</text>
  <text start="1031.37" dur="3.9">and the one mother has multiple children</text>
  <text start="1033.589" dur="5.34">and they come in to take her children</text>
  <text start="1035.27" dur="5.76">and the other mother whose house it was</text>
  <text start="1038.929" dur="3.39">they decided to take her child as well</text>
  <text start="1041.03" dur="3.299">even though they didn&amp;#39;t have an amp with</text>
  <text start="1042.319" dur="3.99">apprehension order for for that child so</text>
  <text start="1044.329" dur="7.261">they illegally apprehended this this</text>
  <text start="1046.309" dur="7.771">young baby right and she&amp;#39;s 19 pounds at</text>
  <text start="1051.59" dur="6.329">the time that that she&amp;#39;s taken into</text>
  <text start="1054.08" dur="6.75">custody six days later she&amp;#39;s weighing 13</text>
  <text start="1057.919" dur="7.38">pounds and is found dead in a car seat</text>
  <text start="1060.83" dur="6.96">both 3 in the afternoon and after being</text>
  <text start="1065.299" dur="5.301">in foster care so six days foster care</text>
  <text start="1067.79" dur="5.32">has lost her five to eight five eight</text>
  <text start="1070.6" dur="4.92">which lost six pounds was extremely ill</text>
  <text start="1073.11" dur="5.02">was told by the parents because I got to</text>
  <text start="1075.52" dur="4.649">visit her about three days previous told</text>
  <text start="1078.13" dur="4.26">by the mom and the grandmother you need</text>
  <text start="1080.169" dur="5.041">to take this baby in right away to the</text>
  <text start="1082.39" dur="4.74">hospital the foster parent didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1085.21" dur="6.57">anything about it other than administer</text>
  <text start="1087.13" dur="6.72">some drugs that she had on hand and it</text>
  <text start="1091.78" dur="3.42">was found in her blood and what they</text>
  <text start="1093.85" dur="3.18">discovered is that the baby had been</text>
  <text start="1095.2" dur="4.29">dead in the in the car seat for both</text>
  <text start="1097.03" dur="5.31">three hours before she was discovered</text>
  <text start="1099.49" dur="5.569">and so here you have a clear case of</text>
  <text start="1102.34" dur="5.85">criminal negligence resulting in death</text>
  <text start="1105.059" dur="5.561">and you have an illegal apprehension</text>
  <text start="1108.19" dur="4.32">from the RCMP and Child Family Services</text>
  <text start="1110.62" dur="4.289">and so what does the crown do about it</text>
  <text start="1112.51" dur="4.68">nothing what does it media do about it</text>
  <text start="1114.909" dur="5.4">we see both I think there&amp;#39;s one article</text>
  <text start="1117.19" dur="4.469">that was done on it that they did a</text>
  <text start="1120.309" dur="3.291">short video and so I&amp;#39;ll be showing that</text>
  <text start="1121.659" dur="5.88">on my Facebook but it&amp;#39;s just crickets</text>
  <text start="1123.6" dur="6.49">silence nobody is willing to do anything</text>
  <text start="1127.539" dur="4.441">and about it it&amp;#39;s no surprise that a</text>
  <text start="1130.09" dur="4.05">baby that age he&amp;#39;s probably still in the</text>
  <text start="1131.98" dur="4.38">breast would stop eating and and have a</text>
  <text start="1134.14" dur="5.01">poor appetite after being kidnapped from</text>
  <text start="1136.36" dur="6.36">its mother and its home I mean that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1139.15" dur="5.04">horrible story yeah absolutely so just</text>
  <text start="1142.72" dur="3.12">it highlights a double standard but you</text>
  <text start="1144.19" dur="3.03">know it would be one thing if this was</text>
  <text start="1145.84" dur="4.38">an isolated incident but this is</text>
  <text start="1147.22" dur="6.93">happening so often and so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1150.22" dur="6.329">crystal clear that the crown has no care</text>
  <text start="1154.15" dur="4.019">for human life whatsoever this is all</text>

  <text start="1223.13" dur="3.78">that that&amp;#39;s exactly what we&amp;#39;re what</text>
  <text start="1224.39" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re seeing now is with the whole</text>
  <text start="1226.91" dur="4.26">speaking I don&amp;#39;t want to highlight too</text>
  <text start="1229.19" dur="4.02">much of this and and put people into</text>
  <text start="1231.17" dur="3.21">fear both speaking out and not want to</text>
  <text start="1233.21" dur="2.73">speak out in fact the only thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1234.38" dur="3">gonna gonna slow this down or or</text>
  <text start="1235.94" dur="3.81">completely turn everything on its head</text>
  <text start="1237.38" dur="4.71">is if everybody stood up and spoke out</text>
  <text start="1239.75" dur="3.6">right now now stuff everybody yeah we</text>
  <text start="1242.09" dur="3.21">everyone is there&amp;#39;s a Great Awakening</text>
  <text start="1243.35" dur="3.45">going on in people are across the world</text>
  <text start="1245.3" dur="4.26">are standing up to corruption this is</text>
  <text start="1246.8" dur="4.68">the time yep and just be aware that</text>
  <text start="1249.56" dur="4.53">there&amp;#39;s gonna be a price to pay for it</text>
  <text start="1251.48" dur="6.36">but it&amp;#39;s a far smaller price than if you</text>
  <text start="1254.09" dur="5.88">remain silent absolutely I mean we get</text>
  <text start="1257.84" dur="3.51">we got to stand up now and protect our</text>
  <text start="1259.97" dur="2.49">children our grandchildren make sure</text>
  <text start="1261.35" dur="3.84">that they live in a much better world</text>
  <text start="1262.46" dur="4.62">but in regard to speaking out that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="1265.19" dur="3.93">of the reasons why I went in jail in in</text>
  <text start="1267.08" dur="3.9">the first place was because I didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="1269.12" dur="3.15">down quietly and so they put me in jail</text>
  <text start="1270.98" dur="2.79">and did in for my wife in jail because</text>
  <text start="1272.27" dur="3.21">she wasn&amp;#39;t speaking out I was the one</text>
  <text start="1273.77" dur="3.39">that was the mall piece and I was</text>
  <text start="1275.48" dur="3.6">highlighting the hypocrisy of the whole</text>
  <text start="1277.16" dur="3.84">issue saying look you&amp;#39;ve got criminal</text>
  <text start="1279.08" dur="3.3">negligence resulting in death because</text>
  <text start="1281" dur="2.46">the ambulance didn&amp;#39;t have the equipment</text>
  <text start="1282.38" dur="2.49">they knew they didn&amp;#39;t have the equipment</text>
  <text start="1283.46" dur="4.2">they didn&amp;#39;t do anything about it until</text>
  <text start="1284.87" dur="4.56">one week after my son passed away they</text>
  <text start="1287.66" dur="3.51">knew about it for over a year before and</text>
  <text start="1289.43" dur="3.81">didn&amp;#39;t act that&amp;#39;s criminal negligence</text>
  <text start="1291.17" dur="3.66">and it resulted in death and yet you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1293.24" dur="2.64">not willing to charge them on a side</text>
  <text start="1294.83" dur="5.58">question what do you think about</text>
  <text start="1295.88" dur="6.9">socialist health care it&amp;#39;s not a good</text>
  <text start="1300.41" dur="5.07">idea at all just want to check and</text>
  <text start="1302.78" dur="3.15">remind everyone that communism socialism</text>
  <text start="1305.48" dur="2.64">sucks</text>
  <text start="1305.93" dur="4.62">all right call me yes socialism is the</text>
  <text start="1308.12" dur="4.38">soft plate communism is not a good thing</text>
  <text start="1310.55" dur="4.14">and the problem is is if you have</text>
  <text start="1312.5" dur="4.14">socialized medicine socialized</text>
  <text start="1314.69" dur="6.09">healthcare at some point it becomes</text>
  <text start="1316.64" dur="6.54">compulsory because you have to for it to</text>
  <text start="1320.78" dur="4.23">be sustainable you have to opt in you</text>
  <text start="1323.18" dur="4.38">have to be a part of it you have to play</text>
  <text start="1325.01" dur="4.95">into it it becomes an integral part of</text>
  <text start="1327.56" dur="4.02">the system that if people decide that</text>
  <text start="1329.96" dur="3.45">they don&amp;#39;t want to be part of it well</text>
  <text start="1331.58" dur="3.15">then it starts to crumble so at some</text>
  <text start="1333.41" dur="3.38">point it&amp;#39;s going to become compulsory</text>
  <text start="1334.73" dur="3.439">and that&amp;#39;s exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="1336.79" dur="4.05">yeah</text>
  <text start="1338.169" dur="6.301">just from that standpoint from a liberty</text>
  <text start="1340.84" dur="5.76">standpoint it&amp;#39;s a horrible idea so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1344.47" dur="3.75">too much hinges on it I want to I want</text>
  <text start="1346.6" dur="3.509">to ask kind of what message you&amp;#39;d have</text>
  <text start="1348.22" dur="3.75">for Americans that are you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1350.109" dur="5.64">facing a very similar sort of precedent</text>
  <text start="1351.97" dur="6.36">seeking monstrous FDA and big pharma</text>
  <text start="1355.749" dur="3.93">combination here and also you know I</text>
  <text start="1358.33" dur="2.52">guess for a fellow Canadians because we</text>
  <text start="1359.679" dur="4.411">do have quite a bit of an audience</text>
  <text start="1360.85" dur="4.799">believe it or not so I you know I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="1364.09" dur="3.839">curious as to what your message for them</text>
  <text start="1365.649" dur="3.84">would be other than to stand up and also</text>
  <text start="1367.929" dur="3.81">where you see this going in the future I</text>
  <text start="1369.489" dur="4.53">mean seem pretty optimistic you&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="1371.739" dur="4.38">some victories so far you&amp;#39;ve got public</text>
  <text start="1374.019" dur="4.62">attention and in terms of speaking out</text>
  <text start="1376.119" dur="3.66">the risk that people take we have the</text>
  <text start="1378.639" dur="2.701">internet now you know we have</text>
  <text start="1379.779" dur="3.181">independent media more than ever now so</text>
  <text start="1381.34" dur="3.929">if you do reach you know if you do speak</text>
  <text start="1382.96" dur="4.049">out and if they do try to attack or lash</text>
  <text start="1385.269" dur="3.331">out at you for that there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s ways</text>
  <text start="1387.009" dur="2.971">to fight back in the most ways to get</text>
  <text start="1388.6" dur="3.929">the word out and to use it against them</text>
  <text start="1389.98" dur="6.259">so there are a lot of people out there</text>
  <text start="1392.529" dur="6.15">hungry to support those who do stand up</text>
  <text start="1396.239" dur="4.57">absolutely yeah and in regard to</text>
  <text start="1398.679" dur="4.95">standing up but in many instances even</text>
  <text start="1400.809" dur="5.791">though it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been it&amp;#39;s taken a toll</text>
  <text start="1403.629" dur="5.88">on us it&amp;#39;s also served as a sense of</text>
  <text start="1406.6" dur="4.799">protection for us because had we not</text>
  <text start="1409.509" dur="3.961">been speaking out while the narrative</text>
  <text start="1411.399" dur="4.561">would have been fully dictated by the</text>
  <text start="1413.47" dur="6.209">media which is so false it&amp;#39;s so far off</text>
  <text start="1415.96" dur="5.88">and we might you know be in jail right</text>
  <text start="1419.679" dur="4.83">now if we weren&amp;#39;t willing to speak up</text>
  <text start="1421.84" dur="5.459">and be the alternative media and so I</text>
  <text start="1424.509" dur="4.591">guess a message that I have to fellow</text>
  <text start="1427.299" dur="6.99">Canadians and to fellow</text>
  <text start="1429.1" dur="6.689">Liberty loving Americans is is to really</text>
  <text start="1434.289" dur="5.671">you know when you&amp;#39;re moving into this</text>
  <text start="1435.789" dur="5.97">and I&amp;#39;ve been in this for the awakening</text>
  <text start="1439.96" dur="4.529">I guess for about 15 years now at first</text>
  <text start="1441.759" dur="4.201">I went pretty angry when I saw the</text>
  <text start="1444.489" dur="4.831">corruption that was taking place the</text>
  <text start="1445.96" dur="5.699">whole 9/11 issues everything it it was</text>
  <text start="1449.32" dur="4.289">it was it was appalling to me and there</text>
  <text start="1451.659" dur="4.561">was a sense of resentment and and I</text>
  <text start="1453.609" dur="4.5">became kind of bitter and cynical and I</text>
  <text start="1456.22" dur="3.87">had to kind of you know for the sake of</text>
  <text start="1458.109" dur="4.26">my family the sake of my well-being and</text>
  <text start="1460.09" dur="4.679">everything going to a state of love were</text>
  <text start="1462.369" dur="5.03">rather than focusing on that which I</text>
  <text start="1464.769" dur="6.931">despised which I disdain which I hate</text>
  <text start="1467.399" dur="7.361">focus on that which I love and by nature</text>
  <text start="1471.7" dur="5.88">you end up exposing the corruption but</text>
  <text start="1474.76" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s not what your focus is in its so</text>
  <text start="1477.58" dur="4.23">example the reason why I&amp;#39;m moving</text>
  <text start="1479.5" dur="3.84">forward in this it&amp;#39;s not because I hate</text>
  <text start="1481.81" dur="3.24">the corruption of the crown and of the</text>
  <text start="1483.34" dur="3.87">medical system and what they did to my</text>
  <text start="1485.05" dur="4.14">family and I want I want blood that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1487.21" dur="4.08">not at all what the motivating factor is</text>
  <text start="1489.19" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s a fact that I love my children and</text>
  <text start="1491.29" dur="5.31">that that you know one they need their</text>
  <text start="1494.5" dur="3.93">parents with them or it would be a much</text>
  <text start="1496.6" dur="3.27">much more beneficial for them to have</text>
  <text start="1498.43" dur="4.4">their parents with them rather than in</text>
  <text start="1499.87" dur="7.23">jail so that&amp;#39;s one reason to stand up</text>
  <text start="1502.83" dur="7.78">second reason is because so much hinges</text>
  <text start="1507.1" dur="5.61">on this case in regard to the freedoms</text>
  <text start="1510.61" dur="4.56">of every other parent out there the</text>
  <text start="1512.71" dur="6">whole attack on the family is is is</text>
  <text start="1515.17" dur="5.58">found within within this case and I love</text>
  <text start="1518.71" dur="4.2">the sanctity of family if you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1520.75" dur="4.17">strong families you don&amp;#39;t have strong</text>
  <text start="1522.91" dur="4.77">communities on strong nations right in</text>
  <text start="1524.92" dur="6.45">essence and so and actually the greatest</text>
  <text start="1527.68" dur="6.18">threat to government tyranny is strong</text>
  <text start="1531.37" dur="3.63">value-based families and so that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1533.86" dur="3.87">we see the attack on the family but I</text>
  <text start="1535" dur="4.62">love family and so in order to maintain</text>
  <text start="1537.73" dur="3.99">the same to be of that family I need two</text>
  <text start="1539.62" dur="4.71">of the family within the system I have</text>
  <text start="1541.72" dur="5.55">to continue to fight to prevent that</text>
  <text start="1544.33" dur="5.81">erosion of parental rights and then also</text>
  <text start="1547.27" dur="4.86">the fact that people have a choice to um</text>
  <text start="1550.14" dur="3.91">medicine whether it be natural or</text>
  <text start="1552.13" dur="4.95">allopathic homeopathic whatever whatever</text>
  <text start="1554.05" dur="5.13">it is they have that right to choose to</text>
  <text start="1557.08" dur="4.8">educate themselves on to do the research</text>
  <text start="1559.18" dur="5.55">and to make one choice or or to not</text>
  <text start="1561.88" dur="4.98">decide to do something and so that also</text>
  <text start="1564.73" dur="3.99">was hinging on our case and so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1566.86" dur="5.37">what propelled me forward and just by</text>
  <text start="1568.72" dur="5.82">nature of moving forward in this you</text>
  <text start="1572.23" dur="5.43">expose the corruption but it&amp;#39;s not your</text>
  <text start="1574.54" dur="5.07">focus so I&amp;#39;m focusing I guess I&amp;#39;ve kind</text>
  <text start="1577.66" dur="5.49">of taken it from a place of resentment</text>
  <text start="1579.61" dur="6.77">and hatred for that which is is just</text>
  <text start="1583.15" dur="5.91">evil really in essence to a place of</text>
  <text start="1586.38" dur="5.08">making sure that I&amp;#39;m protecting and and</text>
  <text start="1589.06" dur="4.53">propagating that which I love and so I</text>
  <text start="1591.46" dur="3.72">guess that would be probably the the</text>
  <text start="1593.59" dur="4.86">greatest message that I could share is</text>
  <text start="1595.18" dur="5.1">to get into that place of love get into</text>
  <text start="1598.45" dur="3.6">that place of love where you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1600.28" dur="5.14">actually part of the solution rather</text>
  <text start="1602.05" dur="4.87">than just identifying the issues at hand</text>
  <text start="1605.42" dur="4.259">you know that&amp;#39;s a very powerful</text>
  <text start="1606.92" dur="4.62">statement and love is the most powerful</text>
  <text start="1609.679" dur="3.181">thing of all sometimes they say in like</text>
  <text start="1611.54" dur="2.91">all the movies in the books and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1612.86" dur="3.84">kind of the essence of it right there</text>
  <text start="1614.45" dur="4.44">that you&amp;#39;ve just described it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="1616.7" dur="4.109">love is a super thing in and of itself</text>
  <text start="1618.89" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s that you&amp;#39;re willing to do anything</text>
  <text start="1620.809" dur="5.281">it takes no matter what the sacrifice</text>
  <text start="1622.61" dur="5.31">for the people that you know so David</text>
  <text start="1626.09" dur="3.69">thank you so much for being that guy and</text>
  <text start="1627.92" dur="3.629">you know I&amp;#39;d like to have you back on</text>
  <text start="1629.78" dur="2.91">keep us updated with the case and such</text>
  <text start="1631.549" dur="5.341">is there anything that we missed that</text>
  <text start="1632.69" dur="5.64">you want to cover before we go not not</text>
  <text start="1636.89" dur="4.71">that I can think of other than that this</text>
  <text start="1638.33" dur="5.7">is gonna be a continuing saga with the</text>
  <text start="1641.6" dur="4.26">whole they&amp;#39;ve appealed it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1644.03" dur="3.62">they&amp;#39;re pushing forward quickly so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1645.86" dur="4.77">gonna continue to remain in the news</text>

  <text start="1650.63" dur="5.39">eight years out from the passing my son</text>
  <text start="1653.179" dur="5.37">and yet they&amp;#39;re still beating on this so</text>
  <text start="1656.02" dur="5.56">it&amp;#39;ll be a relevant topic that that</text>
  <text start="1658.549" dur="6.061">continues on and hopefully we have this</text>
  <text start="1661.58" dur="5.339">this case law solidified in the higher</text>
  <text start="1664.61" dur="5.61">courts as well so that it stands across</text>
  <text start="1666.919" dur="6.301">Canada to further protect parents and in</text>
  <text start="1670.22" dur="4.92">the family so I wish you the best of</text>
