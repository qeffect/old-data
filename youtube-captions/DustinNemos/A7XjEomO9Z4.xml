  <text start="155.989" dur="4.381">Q rally so that way he can focus on</text>
  <text start="158.6" dur="2.59">what&amp;#39;s going on there as opposed to</text>
  <text start="160.37" dur="3.49">worrying</text>
  <text start="161.19" dur="4.92">about making sure that we keep a good</text>
  <text start="163.86" dur="4.44">flow on what&amp;#39;s going on in the news so</text>

  <text start="174.75" dur="5.06">say about that let&amp;#39;s get into it so the</text>
  <text start="177.18" dur="5.31">first thing I want to talk about is</text>
  <text start="179.81" dur="5.59">president Trump and how he presented the</text>
  <text start="182.49" dur="5.82">Medal of Valor to eleven individuals six</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="5.64">of those were police officers who had</text>
  <text start="188.31" dur="7.11">responded very quickly to the Dayton</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="7.38">shooter 32 seconds 32 seconds they had</text>
  <text start="195.42" dur="6.45">stopped this shooting which was really</text>
  <text start="198.42" dur="6.33">incredible and really likely saved</text>
  <text start="201.87" dur="5.1">hundreds of lives this is a good thing</text>
  <text start="204.75" dur="4.8">they deserve this medal they deserve</text>
  <text start="206.97" dur="4.59">this honor and of course you won&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="209.55" dur="3.3">this plastered all over mainstream media</text>
  <text start="211.56" dur="3.27">because of course they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="212.85" dur="4.83">highlight the fact that President Trump</text>
  <text start="214.83" dur="5.33">is recognizing these folks not only did</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="5.31">he recognize the police officers in</text>
  <text start="220.16" dur="6.61">Dayton but he also recognized five</text>
  <text start="222.99" dur="7.23">individuals from the El Paso shooting so</text>
  <text start="226.77" dur="6.33">five everyday citizens had risked their</text>
  <text start="230.22" dur="6.78">lives to save the lives of others likely</text>
  <text start="233.1" dur="6.51">people they didn&amp;#39;t even know so when the</text>
  <text start="237" dur="4.38">Walmart shooter went in there was</text>
  <text start="239.61" dur="4.26">another man his name is Robert who was</text>
  <text start="241.38" dur="5.1">outside in the parking lot he saw the</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="5.16">shooter go in he instead of running away</text>
  <text start="246.48" dur="4.8">fleeing away in his car or even standing</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="5.429">outside and calling the police he runs</text>
  <text start="251.28" dur="5.489">inside towards danger and makes sure</text>
  <text start="254.459" dur="4.56">that he guides people to the nearest</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="4.021">emergency exits because he wanted to</text>
  <text start="259.019" dur="3.631">make sure that those people weren&amp;#39;t hurt</text>
  <text start="260.79" dur="5.07">and then there were several others who</text>
  <text start="262.65" dur="4.95">took immediate action without thinking</text>
  <text start="265.86" dur="3.99">about what was going to happen to them</text>
  <text start="267.6" dur="4.68">including a man who was there with his</text>
  <text start="269.85" dur="4.44">children when the shooter came in and he</text>
  <text start="272.28" dur="4.05">started hurling anything who could get</text>
  <text start="274.29" dur="4.41">his hands on at the shooter which</text>
  <text start="276.33" dur="4.44">distracted the shooter and of course he</text>
  <text start="278.7" dur="4.92">got hurt seriously injured in the</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="5.25">process of that he is alive he survived</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="5.07">and he&amp;#39;s recovering well so that is good</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="5.31">news but this is a good thing so</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="4.5">President Trump had responded to this he</text>
  <text start="291.33" dur="3.07">went and visited these cities he talked</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="4.33">to the people who were there</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="5.16">and now he is recognizing those who</text>
  <text start="297.52" dur="5.04">deserve the honor because they saved</text>
  <text start="299.56" dur="6.69">lives so that&amp;#39;s good news I&amp;#39;m always</text>
  <text start="302.56" dur="7.02">glad to start off with good news okay in</text>
  <text start="306.25" dur="5.07">other news speaking of guns and mass</text>
  <text start="309.58" dur="4.04">shootings of course the Democrat</text>
  <text start="311.32" dur="5.7">response was to immediately call for</text>
  <text start="313.62" dur="5.89">stricter gun control this is straight</text>
  <text start="317.02" dur="6.899">out of the liberal playbook we already</text>
  <text start="319.51" dur="7.65">expected this now of course what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.919" dur="6.541">proposing will not address the issue it</text>
  <text start="327.16" dur="7.05">will not solve the problem because</text>
  <text start="330.46" dur="5.91">criminals will always be able to get a</text>
  <text start="334.21" dur="4.56">hold of a weapon no matter what they</text>
  <text start="336.37" dur="4.59">will not obey laws because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="338.77" dur="4.38">criminals that&amp;#39;s what makes them</text>
  <text start="340.96" dur="5.34">criminals they don&amp;#39;t care about laws</text>
  <text start="343.15" dur="5.76">they don&amp;#39;t care about right and wrong so</text>
  <text start="346.3" dur="4.71">this whole idea that if we enact</text>
  <text start="348.91" dur="3.39">stricter gun control it will all of a</text>
  <text start="351.01" dur="4.05">sudden make all these mass shootings</text>
  <text start="352.3" dur="5.67">disappear it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="355.06" dur="6.63">and in fact Walmart is a perfect example</text>
  <text start="357.97" dur="6.419">so now they&amp;#39;re requesting that patrons</text>
  <text start="361.69" dur="5.039">do not open carry in their Walmart&amp;#39;s of</text>
  <text start="364.389" dur="4.321">course it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a request not like a</text>
  <text start="366.729" dur="4.081">strict rule or anything but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="368.71" dur="6.269">requesting that but the thing is is they</text>
  <text start="370.81" dur="7.77">forgot that a year ago a person who was</text>
  <text start="374.979" dur="6.091">there at the Walmart who had his gun he</text>
  <text start="378.58" dur="4.92">had a license to carry he had his weapon</text>
  <text start="381.07" dur="5.129">and when a shooter decided that they</text>
  <text start="383.5" dur="5.52">were going to attack the Walmart then</text>
  <text start="386.199" dur="6.571">that guy was able to stop that shooter</text>
  <text start="389.02" dur="5.79">because he had a gun so a good guy with</text>
  <text start="392.77" dur="3.57">a gun stops a bad guy with the gun but</text>
  <text start="394.81" dur="3.96">of course Walmart has a very short</text>
  <text start="396.34" dur="7.68">memory and so they&amp;#39;re falling right in</text>
  <text start="398.77" dur="7.22">line with this whole push to make the</text>
  <text start="404.02" dur="4.11">Second Amendment basically just go away</text>
  <text start="405.99" dur="4.51">that&amp;#39;s what they want to do they want to</text>
  <text start="408.13" dur="6.18">chip away at it until it&amp;#39;s no longer in</text>
  <text start="410.5" dur="6.63">existence so bit of work has said that</text>
  <text start="414.31" dur="5.22">gun owners will willingly hand over</text>
  <text start="417.13" dur="4.409">their firearms he stopped short of</text>
  <text start="419.53" dur="4.56">saying that he would send police</text>
  <text start="421.539" dur="4.691">officers door-to-door but how on earth</text>
  <text start="424.09" dur="4.75">does he even expect to an</text>
  <text start="426.23" dur="5.96">force this rule that he&amp;#39;s said that he</text>
  <text start="428.84" dur="7.05">will enact if he takes office he will</text>
  <text start="432.19" dur="7.72">make sure that there is a buyback</text>
  <text start="435.89" dur="5.97">program a mandatory buyback program but</text>
  <text start="439.91" dur="3.99">how is he going to enforce that well he</text>
  <text start="441.86" dur="6.29">thinks that law-abiding citizens will</text>
  <text start="443.9" dur="8.34">just turn over their weapons willingly</text>
  <text start="448.15" dur="7.2">I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that most people would</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="6.14">not feel too happy about that policy</text>
  <text start="455.35" dur="11.86">having to turn over their guns without</text>
  <text start="458.38" dur="11.29">committing any crime this is not OK and</text>
  <text start="467.21" dur="6.84">this is not going to be a policy that</text>
  <text start="469.67" dur="7.17">people accept but of course again this</text>
  <text start="474.05" dur="5.07">is what a lot of them are proposing not</text>
  <text start="476.84" dur="4.86">just beta or work but a lot of them are</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="5.39">proposing this mandatory buyback program</text>
  <text start="481.7" dur="6.54">and even Joe Biden had suggested that</text>
  <text start="484.51" dur="6.73">all weapons with magazines that hold</text>
  <text start="488.24" dur="9.96">multiple rounds should be done away with</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="8.88">which virtually includes every gun so</text>
  <text start="498.2" dur="4.62">this is not going to be acceptable to</text>
  <text start="500.12" dur="5.07">the American people good luck with that</text>
  <text start="502.82" dur="4.68">better work good thing you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="505.19" dur="5.7">actually going to be president don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="507.5" dur="3.78">have a shot in the dark at that so all</text>
  <text start="510.89" dur="5.339">right</text>
  <text start="511.28" dur="9.27">in other news McCabe Andrew McCabe they</text>
  <text start="516.229" dur="6.961">are seeking his text messages in the spy</text>
  <text start="520.55" dur="6.21">gate probe that is still ongoing</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="6.36">so of course the FBI has stonewalled</text>
  <text start="526.76" dur="5.01">every request for all of these text</text>
  <text start="529.55" dur="5.16">messages and really any evidence related</text>
  <text start="531.77" dur="7.07">to the spy gate probe and the Hillary</text>
  <text start="534.71" dur="7.17">email scandal but judicial watch is</text>
  <text start="538.84" dur="6.34">continuing to push this issue they are</text>
  <text start="541.88" dur="5.07">continuing to push the FOIA request for</text>
  <text start="545.18" dur="4.56">all of these pieces of evidence that are</text>
  <text start="546.95" dur="5.1">extremely relevant this would be</text>
  <text start="549.74" dur="4.59">relevant not only to the spy me the spy</text>
  <text start="552.05" dur="5.09">gate probe but also to the Hillary email</text>
  <text start="554.33" dur="5.629">case that was</text>
  <text start="557.14" dur="4.77">essentially closed for no reason other</text>
  <text start="559.959" dur="5.94">than the fact that they expected her to</text>
  <text start="561.91" dur="6">win the presidency but he is not out of</text>
  <text start="565.899" dur="3.75">the woods yet and neither is Comey and</text>
  <text start="567.91" dur="7.83">neither is struck and neither is anyone</text>
  <text start="569.649" dur="13.141">else that has had any hand in the Russia</text>
  <text start="575.74" dur="8.969">hoax in the FISA abuse scandal and yet</text>
  <text start="582.79" dur="4.08">another player who seems to be acting</text>
  <text start="584.709" dur="6">like he has something to hide is Jerry</text>
  <text start="586.87" dur="8.209">Nadler he just cannot let go of this</text>
  <text start="590.709" dur="11.12">whole Russia collusion hoax he is still</text>
  <text start="595.079" dur="9.551">trying to keep it alive barely alive by</text>
  <text start="601.829" dur="5.771">pushing the fact that President Trump</text>
  <text start="604.63" dur="5.78">somehow has committed crimes and</text>
  <text start="607.6" dur="5.66">corruption that he doesn&amp;#39;t even name</text>
  <text start="610.41" dur="9.64">although he claims that they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="613.26" dur="9.55">serious crimes clear crimes but yet</text>
  <text start="620.05" dur="7.099">these clear crimes can&amp;#39;t be named to the</text>
  <text start="622.81" dur="7.2">public he hasn&amp;#39;t mentioned one thing</text>
  <text start="627.149" dur="5.321">that President Trump has done the only</text>
  <text start="630.01" dur="4.98">thing he does is continue to claim that</text>
  <text start="632.47" dur="8.51">somehow President Trump is corrupt</text>
  <text start="634.99" dur="8.67">and that he&amp;#39;s a criminal quote and that</text>
  <text start="640.98" dur="5.76">he needs to determine whether or not</text>
  <text start="643.66" dur="6.09">they can move forward with impeachment</text>
  <text start="646.74" dur="5.8">how long are we going to be asking this</text>
  <text start="649.75" dur="6.74">question how many hearings do we need to</text>
  <text start="652.54" dur="6.81">have on this issue so yet again he is</text>
  <text start="656.49" dur="5.8">scheduling another vote on whether or</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="6.179">not they can move forward with</text>
  <text start="662.29" dur="6.15">impeachment this vote is to determine</text>
  <text start="665.529" dur="8.281">whether or not they have anything on</text>
  <text start="668.44" dur="10.53">President Trump this is such a waste of</text>
  <text start="673.81" dur="6.51">time a waste of tax dollars there are so</text>
  <text start="678.97" dur="4.32">many things that they could be working</text>
  <text start="680.32" dur="5.43">on no wonder they&amp;#39;re having a crisis in</text>
  <text start="683.29" dur="4.859">California with homelessness they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="685.75" dur="4.56">have time to address those issues they</text>
  <text start="688.149" dur="3.601">have to sit around and vote on</text>
  <text start="690.31" dur="3.27">whether or not they can move forward</text>
  <text start="691.75" dur="4.68">with impeachment when they already know</text>
  <text start="693.58" dur="5.1">the answer to that they just want to</text>
  <text start="696.43" dur="8.07">keep beating a dead horse they want to</text>
  <text start="698.68" dur="10.23">keep the idea alive in the mind of the</text>
  <text start="704.5" dur="6.54">public they want the public to think</text>
  <text start="708.91" dur="4.35">that there&amp;#39;s something there because</text>
  <text start="711.04" dur="4.049">again somebody said it best the other</text>
  <text start="713.26" dur="5.22">day I forget who it was but they said</text>

  <text start="734.38" dur="4.05">a significant portion of the public will</text>
  <text start="736.57" dur="3.75">sit there and think that oh well</text>
  <text start="738.43" dur="5.57">president Trump must have done something</text>

  <text start="755.7" dur="4.74">seriously why are they even still there</text>

  <text start="764.17" dur="5.99">news we have George Soros and no</text>
  <text start="766.9" dur="7.41">surprise he had actually dumped over</text>
  <text start="770.16" dur="6.52">$400,000 into Kim Fox so three hundred</text>

  <text start="787.15" dur="6.6">that totaled four hundred eight thousand</text>

  <text start="793.75" dur="6.66">same prosecutor that took nearly half a</text>
  <text start="796.6" dur="10.47">million dollars from George Soros is the</text>

  <text start="818.73" dur="9">somehow racist and dangerous no surprise</text>
  <text start="825.66" dur="8.76">that George Soros would be behind this</text>
  <text start="827.73" dur="8.849">lady now right now they&amp;#39;re reopening</text>
  <text start="834.42" dur="4.169">this case they&amp;#39;re looking at Kim Fox</text>
  <text start="836.579" dur="4.141">again and they&amp;#39;re looking at how she</text>
  <text start="838.589" dur="4.23">handled this case and the likely what</text>
  <text start="840.72" dur="5.549">will happen is if they end up</text>
  <text start="842.819" dur="5.731">prosecuting her over this then Jesse</text>
  <text start="846.269" dur="8.13">Smollett is not out of the woods yet</text>
  <text start="848.55" dur="12.329">either he can be retried over this they</text>

  <text start="863.999" dur="4.02">to be seen</text>
  <text start="864.569" dur="5.161">hopefully so because as the law</text>
  <text start="868.019" dur="3.721">enforcement officials who are working on</text>
  <text start="869.73" dur="4.109">this diligently for three weeks before</text>
  <text start="871.74" dur="6.539">they even arrested him they had said</text>
  <text start="873.839" dur="6.211">that it was a rock-solid case they had</text>
  <text start="878.279" dur="5.79">all the evidence that they needed to</text>
  <text start="880.05" dur="8.07">show that Jesse Smollett had set this</text>

  <text start="888.12" dur="6.3">attack him to make it look a certain</text>
  <text start="890.129" dur="6.9">type of way they had all the evidence</text>
  <text start="894.42" dur="9.889">and of course Kim Fox had ordered that</text>
  <text start="897.029" dur="11.55">evidence to be sealed that whole</text>
  <text start="904.309" dur="7.72">situation was corrupt so we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="908.579" dur="10.11">what happens with that all right</text>
  <text start="912.029" dur="9.99">in other news so more corruption we have</text>
  <text start="918.689" dur="6.06">a judge in the Ninth Circuit of course</text>
  <text start="922.019" dur="4.86">present Trump always has issues with the</text>
  <text start="924.749" dur="5.25">Ninth Circuit and so this Obama</text>
  <text start="926.879" dur="6.93">appointed judge has reinstated the block</text>
  <text start="929.999" dur="6.601">on Trump&amp;#39;s Asylum ban so with the asylum</text>
  <text start="933.809" dur="7.791">ban it has to do with the third country</text>
  <text start="936.6" dur="8.39">rule so it says that individuals who</text>
  <text start="941.6" dur="8.159">are coming from Central America for</text>
  <text start="944.99" dur="9.24">example they cannot travel through</text>
  <text start="949.759" dur="6.81">Mexico and then try to claim asylum here</text>
  <text start="954.23" dur="4.89">at our southern border in the United</text>
  <text start="956.569" dur="5.58">States they cannot do that they have to</text>
  <text start="959.12" dur="7.019">claim asylum in the first safe country</text>
  <text start="962.149" dur="8.49">that they reach that is the rule so US</text>
  <text start="966.139" dur="6.781">District Judge John Tigger arteaga I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="970.639" dur="3.89">not sure how to pronounce it so somebody</text>
  <text start="972.92" dur="6.649">knows they can correct me I don&amp;#39;t mind</text>
  <text start="974.529" dur="7.99">but this federal judge had initially</text>
  <text start="979.569" dur="6.851">placed an injunction on the asylum ban</text>
  <text start="982.519" dur="6.93">the third country rule but then his</text>
  <text start="986.42" dur="4.409">ruling was limited to California and</text>
  <text start="989.449" dur="4.741">Arizona because that&amp;#39;s where his</text>
  <text start="990.829" dur="5.731">district was that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s his district</text>
  <text start="994.19" dur="5.48">so his authority should be limited to</text>
  <text start="996.56" dur="6.089">that area however now all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="999.67" dur="5.589">that&amp;#39;s changed and he was able to</text>
  <text start="1002.649" dur="8.75">reinstate the block across the entire</text>
  <text start="1005.259" dur="9.661">border how on earth was that possible if</text>
  <text start="1011.399" dur="8.401">he has extended his authority beyond his</text>
  <text start="1014.92" dur="4.88">district this should not be allowed</text>
  <text start="1021.24" dur="8.589">really and I think when it comes to the</text>
  <text start="1025.329" dur="6.451">protection of our borders the commander</text>
  <text start="1029.829" dur="8.071">in chief President Trump should have</text>
  <text start="1031.78" dur="13.769">authority over this judge this district</text>
  <text start="1037.9" dur="10.32">judge especially since there has already</text>
  <text start="1045.549" dur="4.701">been a national emergency that was</text>
  <text start="1048.22" dur="5.22">declared</text>
  <text start="1050.25" dur="5.47">so really the national emergency should</text>
  <text start="1053.44" dur="4.32">allow President Trump to take whatever</text>
  <text start="1055.72" dur="7.709">measure is necessary in order to address</text>
  <text start="1057.76" dur="8.18">that emergency so why all of this</text>
  <text start="1063.429" dur="9.531">pushback is allowed</text>
  <text start="1065.94" dur="10.74">is beyond me so hopefully we&amp;#39;ll see that</text>
  <text start="1072.96" dur="7.17">this block is lifted once more because</text>
  <text start="1076.68" dur="7.35">this should not be allowed okay other</text>

  <text start="1198.779" dur="6.451">so they actually flew out there rather</text>
  <text start="1201.36" dur="6.48">than just not follow up on the case</text>
  <text start="1205.23" dur="4.529">because it&amp;#39;s out of state they decided</text>

  <text start="1217.08" dur="5.729">after in New York is apparently really</text>
  <text start="1219.899" dur="5.22">either a really high up person in the</text>

  <text start="1225.119" dur="6.331">I&amp;#39;m assuming that it&amp;#39;s not the boss that</text>
  <text start="1227.999" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s just a guy who is high-ranking in</text>
  <text start="1231.45" dur="6">the network and I&amp;#39;ll explain why here in</text>
  <text start="1233.549" dur="6.781">a minute but in this case they were able</text>
  <text start="1237.45" dur="5.49">to track this individual to New York</text>
  <text start="1240.33" dur="7.349">because of one of the victims and one of</text>
  <text start="1242.94" dur="8.339">the victims was a Chinese immigrant so</text>
  <text start="1247.679" dur="7.261">this is a common theme now I talked</text>
  <text start="1251.279" dur="5.39">about this oh and just to mention just</text>
  <text start="1254.94" dur="5.459">for a second here talking about this</text>
  <text start="1256.669" dur="6.73">Chinese victim this Chinese victim was</text>
  <text start="1260.399" dur="5.551">apparently trafficked through several</text>
  <text start="1263.399" dur="4.681">states not that she was trafficked from</text>
  <text start="1265.95" dur="6.859">New York straight to Texas she was</text>
  <text start="1268.08" dur="12.449">trafficked all over the country all over</text>
  <text start="1272.809" dur="15.33">the country so and at least seven states</text>
  <text start="1280.529" dur="9.9">they say so this is a common theme and</text>
  <text start="1288.139" dur="6.49">initially I had started talking about</text>
  <text start="1290.429" dur="6.6">this back in January February with the</text>
  <text start="1294.629" dur="4.111">crafts case right they call it the</text>
  <text start="1297.029" dur="3.831">crafts case but it&amp;#39;s not really the</text>
  <text start="1298.74" dur="9.139">Caprica crafts case they called it that</text>
  <text start="1300.86" dur="10.72">because he was the face of that case</text>
  <text start="1307.879" dur="6">there were several states involved in</text>
  <text start="1311.58" dur="7.729">that Network and they had mentioned that</text>
  <text start="1313.879" dur="9.49">that network was connected to China and</text>
  <text start="1319.309" dur="6.521">so initially the craft case was</text>
  <text start="1323.369" dur="4.41">classified as an international sex</text>
  <text start="1325.83" dur="4.179">trafficking net</text>
  <text start="1327.779" dur="5.08">that&amp;#39;s how they were investigating it</text>
  <text start="1330.009" dur="6.6">and they had evidence initially but then</text>
  <text start="1332.859" dur="7.17">eventually that case got watered down</text>
  <text start="1336.609" dur="7.56">and all I&amp;#39;ll say that it&amp;#39;s my opinion</text>
  <text start="1340.029" dur="5.821">that the reason why about it as national</text>
  <text start="1344.169" dur="4.32">sex trafficking case in the beginning</text>
  <text start="1345.85" dur="4.85">was because they were hoping the</text>
  <text start="1348.489" dur="7.32">connected to President Trump</text>
  <text start="1350.7" dur="8.53">anything to make him look bad and so</text>
  <text start="1355.809" dur="6.18">Kraft had loosely been connected with</text>
  <text start="1359.23" dur="4.11">President Trump so they tried to make</text>
  <text start="1361.989" dur="3.81">the connect there and then there were a</text>
  <text start="1363.34" dur="5.059">couple of others who were involved in</text>
  <text start="1365.799" dur="7.801">that case who were connected to</text>
  <text start="1368.399" dur="10.061">high-ranking Republicans so they named</text>
  <text start="1373.6" dur="6.389">those individuals as well but they</text>
  <text start="1378.46" dur="3.089">didn&amp;#39;t name anyone else even though</text>
  <text start="1379.989" dur="4.53">there were other prominent individuals</text>
  <text start="1381.549" dur="5.88">they didn&amp;#39;t name anyone else only three</text>
  <text start="1384.519" dur="8.25">out of the nearly 200 that they said</text>
  <text start="1387.429" dur="7.051">were involved then the case got watered</text>
  <text start="1392.769" dur="4.38">down when it didn&amp;#39;t accomplish what they</text>
  <text start="1394.48" dur="4.71">wanted to accomplish they wanted to snag</text>
  <text start="1397.149" dur="5.16">President Trump in this network but it</text>
  <text start="1399.19" dur="7.709">didn&amp;#39;t happen so when that didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="1402.309" dur="10.08">the case completely fell apart now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1406.899" dur="8.46">just a prostitution sting even though</text>
  <text start="1412.389" dur="6.39">they had evidence that it was a human</text>
  <text start="1415.359" dur="5.841">sex trafficking operation and during</text>
  <text start="1418.779" dur="6.33">that case they had talked about how</text>
  <text start="1421.2" dur="8.53">Asian Southeast Asian individuals</text>
  <text start="1425.109" dur="11.371">migrants were brought in to various</text>

  <text start="1443.259" dur="5.581">Southeast Asia through Flushing New York</text>

  <text start="1454.28" dur="9.15">so I find it very interesting that this</text>
  <text start="1458.94" dur="4.49">case has also led them to New York I</text>
  <text start="1464.24" dur="7.36">also found this other article so in this</text>
  <text start="1468.75" dur="4.98">article there&amp;#39;s a woman by the name of</text>

  <text start="1521.1" dur="5.7">so that particular Network spanned</text>
  <text start="1524.67" dur="5.85">across four states Florida Virginia</text>
  <text start="1526.8" dur="6.89">Pennsylvania and Massachusetts so we</text>
  <text start="1530.52" dur="6.24">have a common link here but that is not</text>
  <text start="1533.69" dur="5.62">the only similarity between these cases</text>
  <text start="1536.76" dur="3.72">the other similarity besides of course</text>
  <text start="1539.31" dur="4.68">the fact that they&amp;#39;re based out of</text>
  <text start="1540.48" dur="6.72">massage parlors is the fact that oh and</text>
  <text start="1543.99" dur="4.68">not only are their victimized women the</text>
  <text start="1547.2" dur="4.98">ones who they&amp;#39;re trafficking they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1548.67" dur="10.55">Asian descent they&amp;#39;re Asian immigrants</text>
  <text start="1552.18" dur="7.04">right they recruited them from New York</text>
  <text start="1559.28" dur="4.63">now I&amp;#39;m gonna bring it back to the case</text>
  <text start="1561.78" dur="5.58">that I was just talking about out of</text>
  <text start="1563.91" dur="5.37">Waco Texas where now they&amp;#39;re sending</text>
  <text start="1567.36" dur="3.33">their officers they&amp;#39;re flying them to</text>
  <text start="1569.28" dur="5.37">New York because that&amp;#39;s where they</text>
  <text start="1570.69" dur="8.94">followed the case why because a Chinese</text>
  <text start="1574.65" dur="6.39">immigrant undocumented it that these are</text>
  <text start="1579.63" dur="3.21">women who&amp;#39;ve been trafficked here with</text>
  <text start="1581.04" dur="4.019">no papers for the purposes of</text>
  <text start="1582.84" dur="6.16">trafficking</text>
  <text start="1585.059" dur="7.181">that woman had been passed around across</text>
  <text start="1589" dur="10.26">several different states and originated</text>
  <text start="1592.24" dur="9.12">in New York and of course let me remind</text>
  <text start="1599.26" dur="4.11">you what I just talked about a few</text>
  <text start="1601.36" dur="5.88">minutes ago with the Kraft case from</text>
  <text start="1603.37" dur="7.82">back in January February they were also</text>
  <text start="1607.24" dur="3.95">recruiting out of Flushing New York</text>
  <text start="1612.87" dur="7.86">Asian migrants no papers trafficked from</text>
  <text start="1617.26" dur="8.779">China Southeast Asia through New York</text>
  <text start="1620.73" dur="5.309">for the purposes of sex trafficking are</text>
  <text start="1626.46" dur="5.92">we seeing the pattern here because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1631" dur="3.12">been trying to follow this for a little</text>
  <text start="1632.38" dur="4.23">while now trying to piece this all</text>
  <text start="1634.12" dur="6.21">together trying to follow it as closely</text>
  <text start="1636.61" dur="7.65">as possible all right so I also want to</text>
  <text start="1640.33" dur="6.99">briefly mention there was a an academic</text>
  <text start="1644.26" dur="4.049">article that was written on this back in</text>
  <text start="1647.32" dur="5.339">2016</text>
  <text start="1648.309" dur="9.681">and they talked about how trafficking</text>
  <text start="1652.659" dur="9.331">victims a lot of them were Chinese</text>
  <text start="1657.99" dur="7.47">individuals who were trafficked into the</text>
  <text start="1661.99" dur="6.929">United States a lot of them through</text>
  <text start="1665.46" dur="6.339">Flushing New York over the past two</text>
  <text start="1668.919" dur="6.39">decades witnessed a spike in the Asian</text>
  <text start="1671.799" dur="9.12">population in Flushing which increased</text>
  <text start="1675.309" dur="7.891">from 22.1% in 1992 52.4% in 2000 and</text>
  <text start="1680.919" dur="5.061">eventually almost seventy percent in</text>
  <text start="1683.2" dur="2.78">2010</text>
  <text start="1687.529" dur="9.311">now why is this happening also I want to</text>
  <text start="1695.309" dur="3.181">show this so I&amp;#39;ve been looking for this</text>
  <text start="1696.84" dur="3.48">for a while been trying to dig it back</text>
  <text start="1698.49" dur="4.679">up and I finally found it because I</text>
  <text start="1700.32" dur="4.95">found this a while back when I was</text>
  <text start="1703.169" dur="3.571">originally looking into this into human</text>
  <text start="1705.27" dur="4.59">trafficking I was following a little</text>
  <text start="1706.74" dur="6.09">lead there so this is an old WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="1709.86" dur="4.89">document but I find it fairly relevant</text>
  <text start="1712.83" dur="5.87">when we&amp;#39;re looking at it through the</text>
  <text start="1714.75" dur="3.95">lens of what&amp;#39;s going on right now so</text>
  <text start="1718.789" dur="7.39">again it&amp;#39;s a bit old but relevant so</text>
  <text start="1721.559" dur="7.801">it&amp;#39;s from 1975 and it&amp;#39;s to the Secretary</text>
  <text start="1726.179" dur="7.11">of State in Thailand and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1729.36" dur="7.58">talking about here is there is a group</text>
  <text start="1733.289" dur="6.661">of refugees Vietnamese refugees and</text>
  <text start="1736.94" dur="6.58">they&amp;#39;re trying to get them some of them</text>
  <text start="1739.95" dur="6.42">sent to Norway as well as the United</text>
  <text start="1743.52" dur="5.61">States so there&amp;#39;s a particular group of</text>
  <text start="1746.37" dur="4.38">about 29 where they&amp;#39;re saying that this</text>
  <text start="1749.13" dur="5.669">group needs to go to the United States</text>
  <text start="1750.75" dur="9.899">now they are saying in this</text>
  <text start="1754.799" dur="8.311">correspondence that there is a religious</text>
  <text start="1760.649" dur="5.091">philosophical organization called Cebu</text>
  <text start="1763.11" dur="8.059">that&amp;#39;s what they call it of course</text>
  <text start="1765.74" dur="9.309">really it&amp;#39;s more like a cult so subdued</text>
  <text start="1771.169" dur="9.071">is the organization that is going to</text>
  <text start="1775.049" dur="7.951">fund the transfer of these refugees so</text>
  <text start="1780.24" dur="4.59">they want to send them to the United</text>
  <text start="1783" dur="6.659">States and they&amp;#39;re also saying at the</text>
  <text start="1784.83" dur="8.37">bottom of this that they say right here</text>
  <text start="1789.659" dur="7.231">they said a subdued representative in</text>
  <text start="1793.2" dur="5.64">New York has been in contact with a</text>
  <text start="1796.89" dur="3.779">State Department official who said that</text>
  <text start="1798.84" dur="2.969">any requests by members of this group to</text>
  <text start="1800.669" dur="8.63">come to the United States would be</text>
  <text start="1801.809" dur="10.921">favorably considered New York Vietnamese</text>
  <text start="1809.299" dur="7.961">refugees now we&amp;#39;ve talked about refugees</text>
  <text start="1812.73" dur="8.73">before and how refugees really be</text>
  <text start="1817.26" dur="7.54">like human inventory for sex traffickers</text>
  <text start="1821.46" dur="5.83">they&amp;#39;re easy targets and that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="1824.8" dur="4.14">love these areas that are either ripe</text>
  <text start="1827.29" dur="3.96">with conflict or there&amp;#39;s a natural</text>
  <text start="1828.94" dur="7.32">disaster or really anything that makes</text>
  <text start="1831.25" dur="13.92">them vulnerable so also when we think</text>
  <text start="1836.26" dur="12.51">about where Vietnam is Vietnam is on the</text>
  <text start="1845.17" dur="5.61">outskirts of the Golden Triangle here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1848.77" dur="4.65">like a little map that shows the golden</text>
  <text start="1850.78" dur="4.17">triangle and here&amp;#39;s Vietnam Laos is in</text>
  <text start="1853.42" dur="4.23">the center and you have Thailand and</text>
  <text start="1854.95" dur="5.55">Burma over here and oh yeah by the way</text>
  <text start="1857.65" dur="4.44">Burma has a huge refugee problem right</text>
  <text start="1860.5" dur="4.35">now as well and they&amp;#39;re under scrutiny</text>
  <text start="1862.09" dur="7.17">for human trafficking at this point the</text>
  <text start="1864.85" dur="6.84">Golden Triangle and let it be known that</text>
  <text start="1869.26" dur="6.24">it was actually the CIA that gave this</text>
  <text start="1871.69" dur="10.26">area that name I wonder why they called</text>
  <text start="1875.5" dur="9.23">it that so the Golden Triangle is not</text>
  <text start="1881.95" dur="7.23">China but it&amp;#39;s more or less a de-facto</text>
  <text start="1884.73" dur="7.03">Chinese territory all of those who run</text>
  <text start="1889.18" dur="6.27">businesses there they are Chinese they</text>
  <text start="1891.76" dur="6.54">deal in Chinese money there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1895.45" dur="4.74">heavy Chinese influence there now the</text>
  <text start="1898.3" dur="5.79">reason why the Golden Triangle is so</text>
  <text start="1900.19" dur="6.78">important is because that is where the</text>
  <text start="1904.09" dur="8.64">Chinese crime syndicate is and has been</text>
  <text start="1906.97" dur="9.9">for decades because that area is more or</text>
  <text start="1912.73" dur="7.62">less outside of the law so they can</text>
  <text start="1916.87" dur="9.57">operate their criminal activities</text>
  <text start="1920.35" dur="9.3">pretty much under the radar that area is</text>
  <text start="1926.44" dur="5.88">known for human trafficking drug</text>
  <text start="1929.65" dur="7.59">trafficking for example during the</text>
  <text start="1932.32" dur="8.76">period of Iran Contra animal trafficking</text>
  <text start="1937.24" dur="8.46">and organ trafficking and so in this</text>
  <text start="1941.08" dur="7.32">document we have this organization cebu</text>
  <text start="1945.7" dur="3.66">this religious organization funding the</text>
  <text start="1948.4" dur="6.749">transfer</text>
  <text start="1949.36" dur="8.22">of Vietnamese refugees to New York fast</text>
  <text start="1955.149" dur="5.211">forward to present day and we have a</text>
  <text start="1957.58" dur="6.719">problem with a significant number of</text>
  <text start="1960.36" dur="6.25">Asian Southeast Asian immigrants who are</text>
  <text start="1964.299" dur="4.291">being trafficked sex trafficked through</text>
  <text start="1966.61" dur="10.559">massage parlors all across the country</text>
  <text start="1968.59" dur="10.919">through New York another thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1977.169" dur="5.161">interesting about subdued is it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1979.509" dur="6.6">parent CIA connection and in fact it has</text>
  <text start="1982.33" dur="5.4">been accused of being a CIA front which</text>
  <text start="1986.109" dur="7.591">would a surprise me scenes how it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1987.73" dur="8.819">religious cult but it&amp;#39;s said that the</text>
  <text start="1993.7" dur="4.74">CIA relied on subdued cultists as well</text>
  <text start="1996.549" dur="4.32">as Muslims to gain popular support for</text>
  <text start="1998.44" dur="5.03">its cute against sukarno a leftist</text>
  <text start="2000.869" dur="5.9">nationalist and the officially a</text>
  <text start="2003.47" dur="11.439">theistic communist leader of Indonesia</text>
  <text start="2006.769" dur="15.461">so it essentially was used during this</text>
  <text start="2014.909" dur="12.781">coup in order to install the CIA&amp;#39;s pick</text>
  <text start="2022.23" dur="7.35">for a dictator puppet that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="2027.69" dur="5.579">wanted to do so they use this cult to do</text>
  <text start="2029.58" dur="7.469">that on top of that in this memo</text>
  <text start="2033.269" dur="5.821">apparently the CIA memo appears to have</text>
  <text start="2037.049" dur="4.11">had the interest of top-level officials</text>
  <text start="2039.09" dur="4.439">of the State Department Treasury and</text>
  <text start="2041.159" dur="6.98">Pentagon so there we go again we have a</text>
  <text start="2043.529" dur="4.61">State Department and subdued connection</text>
  <text start="2048.649" dur="5.41">so according to this is that on the</text>
  <text start="2051.51" dur="5.94">distribution list of this particular</text>
  <text start="2054.059" dur="4.74">memo was Paul Wolfowitz the Assistant</text>

  <text start="2100.819" dur="7.29">Secretary of State Richard Armitage and</text>
  <text start="2105.579" dur="6.821">we should recognize that name from</text>
  <text start="2108.109" dur="7.201">iran-contra right and I mentioned a</text>
  <text start="2112.4" dur="5.88">minute ago that the Golden Triangle was</text>
  <text start="2115.31" dur="4.71">connected to iran-contra and I&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="2118.28" dur="3.92">about that in a later video it would</text>
  <text start="2120.02" dur="7.29">make this one too long to get into that</text>
  <text start="2122.2" dur="8.29">but that is a deep dive in itself there</text>
  <text start="2127.31" dur="7.11">is a huge u.s. deep State and Chinese</text>
  <text start="2130.49" dur="16.53">connection huge now what also should be</text>
  <text start="2134.42" dur="16.919">noted here is that Obama&amp;#39;s mom was</text>
  <text start="2147.02" dur="8.339">actually a member of subdued as well as</text>
  <text start="2151.339" dur="8.371">an employee of the World Bank and a</text>
  <text start="2155.359" dur="6.871">member of the Ford Foundation oh and</text>
  <text start="2159.71" dur="4.77">also by the way Ford Foundation was also</text>
  <text start="2162.23" dur="4.95">involved in sex trafficking but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2164.48" dur="6.03">get into that in another time but</text>
  <text start="2167.18" dur="9.02">there&amp;#39;s a common pattern here so I think</text>
  <text start="2170.51" dur="9.99">what is interesting is that and satura</text>
  <text start="2176.2" dur="6.19">Obama&amp;#39;s mom was involved in subdued this</text>
  <text start="2180.5" dur="3.39">cult organization that was apparently</text>
  <text start="2182.39" dur="3.87">connected to the CIA and the State</text>
  <text start="2183.89" dur="5.969">Department and apparently had</text>
  <text start="2186.26" dur="5.43">facilitated the transport of refugees to</text>
  <text start="2189.859" dur="3.781">the United States through New York which</text>
  <text start="2191.69" dur="11.909">likely led to human trafficking of those</text>
  <text start="2193.64" dur="13.439">individuals now also so Obama&amp;#39;s mom</text>
  <text start="2203.599" dur="4.951">involved in subdued who else was a</text>
  <text start="2207.079" dur="7.111">member of subdued</text>
  <text start="2208.55" dur="10.08">the woman who changed the birth</text>
  <text start="2214.19" dur="10.32">certificate of Obama and later died in a</text>
  <text start="2218.63" dur="10.17">plane crash not long after that it is</text>
  <text start="2224.51" dur="8.91">also noteworthy that subdued apparently</text>
  <text start="2228.8" dur="8.66">was first brought here to Hawaii then it</text>
  <text start="2233.42" dur="7.23">had a headquarters in Chicago in 2001</text>
  <text start="2237.46" dur="4">then in 2012 during the Obama</text>
  <text start="2240.65" dur="7.44">administration</text>
  <text start="2241.46" dur="11.25">it had a headquarters in DC I find all</text>
  <text start="2248.09" dur="6.87">those facts rather coincidental but at</text>
  <text start="2252.71" dur="7.23">this point I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say that</text>
  <text start="2254.96" dur="7.17">there&amp;#39;s not many coincidences now of</text>
  <text start="2259.94" dur="5.04">course Obama is not the only person who</text>
  <text start="2262.13" dur="10.56">has a connection to the Golden Triangle</text>
  <text start="2264.98" dur="9.27">in fact the Clintons have a pretty tight</text>
  <text start="2272.69" dur="9.71">connection with the Golden Triangle as</text>
  <text start="2274.25" dur="10.68">well now Bill Clinton way back when had</text>
  <text start="2282.4" dur="8.37">set up a visit to the Golden Triangle</text>
  <text start="2284.93" dur="5.84">for the purposes of doing AIDS research</text>
  <text start="2291.04" dur="6.43">philanthropy related to aids the AIDS</text>
  <text start="2294.41" dur="7.89">epidemic that was apparently over</text>
  <text start="2297.47" dur="9">running the Golden Triangle and at this</text>
  <text start="2302.3" dur="7.02">point we understand what it means when</text>
  <text start="2306.47" dur="7.11">the Clinton Foundation decides to go to</text>
  <text start="2309.32" dur="7.83">philanthropy Kirk and it also should be</text>
  <text start="2313.58" dur="8.9">noted that during this trip when they</text>
  <text start="2317.15" dur="12.36">had went to the Golden Triangle to do</text>
  <text start="2322.48" dur="11.32">research and work in AIDS he had took in</text>
  <text start="2329.51" dur="7.88">a private plane there now it never</text>
  <text start="2333.8" dur="6.979">specified whose plane he flew on</text>
  <text start="2337.39" dur="7.669">for that particular trip however at a</text>
  <text start="2340.779" dur="9.3">similar trip when he went to Africa to</text>

  <text start="2350.079" dur="8.551">plane they specified at that time so</text>
  <text start="2355.269" dur="5.911">would it be far-fetched to say that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2358.63" dur="5.85">likely he also used the epstein plane to</text>
  <text start="2361.18" dur="6.089">go to the Golden Triangle and we know</text>
  <text start="2364.48" dur="10.41">that Epstein is a part of this sex</text>
  <text start="2367.269" dur="10.77">trafficking network now the Clintons</text>
  <text start="2374.89" dur="3.8">have dealt with the Chinese for a long</text>
  <text start="2378.039" dur="5.31">time</text>
  <text start="2378.69" dur="9.579">they sold our military technology to the</text>
  <text start="2383.349" dur="9.121">Chinese while he was president he never</text>
  <text start="2388.269" dur="5.79">was held accountable for that now we</text>
  <text start="2392.47" dur="3.629">have the Chinese sailing around with</text>
  <text start="2394.059" dur="8.341">rail guns on their ships they got that</text>
  <text start="2396.099" dur="9.99">from us but also Bill Clinton had a</text>
  <text start="2402.4" dur="10.349">rather tight relationship with some</text>
  <text start="2406.089" dur="12.591">folks over in Taiwan and this lady who</text>
  <text start="2412.749" dur="5.931">was the head of a spiritual organization</text>
  <text start="2419.069" dur="8.7">her name was Ching hai and Ching hai had</text>
  <text start="2423.22" dur="8.19">donated a considerable amount of money</text>
  <text start="2427.769" dur="5.171">to Bill Clinton during the time when he</text>
  <text start="2431.41" dur="7.47">was fighting that whole white water</text>
  <text start="2432.94" dur="8.909">scandal more than $600,000 in donations</text>
  <text start="2438.88" dur="5.939">personally and then she urged others to</text>
  <text start="2441.849" dur="6.031">donate to his cause as well why would a</text>
  <text start="2444.819" dur="6.29">religious organization donate to someone</text>
  <text start="2447.88" dur="3.229">else&amp;#39;s legal problems</text>
  <text start="2453.49" dur="6.76">well not long after she did that she up</text>
  <text start="2457.94" dur="3.63">and disappeared and what I find is</text>
  <text start="2460.25" dur="3.66">interesting in this particular article</text>
  <text start="2461.57" dur="5.46">is that when they&amp;#39;re talking about how</text>
  <text start="2463.91" dur="8.459">they can find this woman and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2467.03" dur="7.89">unable to find her one person who is</text>
  <text start="2472.369" dur="4.74">asked about her whereabouts said this he</text>
  <text start="2474.92" dur="4.38">said he doesn&amp;#39;t even know where she is</text>
  <text start="2477.109" dur="3.99">and they can&amp;#39;t locate any of the members</text>
  <text start="2479.3" dur="4.11">because they don&amp;#39;t know how many members</text>
  <text start="2481.099" dur="4.5">of the group has they&amp;#39;re hard to locate</text>
  <text start="2483.41" dur="4.32">and he says that they could probably</text>
  <text start="2485.599" dur="4.861">have about a hundred thousand worldwide</text>
  <text start="2487.73" dur="5.609">we don&amp;#39;t keep track and then he also</text>
  <text start="2490.46" dur="5.97">said that the Southern California</text>
  <text start="2493.339" dur="8.301">membership was about 3,000 and most of</text>
  <text start="2496.43" dur="8.75">them were refugees from Vietnam so</text>
  <text start="2501.64" dur="6.189">members of a religious organization are</text>
  <text start="2505.18" dur="4.99">in a similar organization to Cebu</text>
  <text start="2507.829" dur="4.321">because this because this religious</text>
  <text start="2510.17" dur="6.03">organization apparently had a connection</text>
  <text start="2512.15" dur="6.77">to Cebu as well so that particular</text>
  <text start="2516.2" dur="8.25">organization had members that were</text>
  <text start="2518.92" dur="9.04">refugees from Vietnam I wonder if they</text>
  <text start="2524.45" dur="8.21">were being trafficked as well so going</text>
  <text start="2527.96" dur="8.82">back to my original point which was this</text>
  <text start="2532.66" dur="7.62">network that is being investigated right</text>
  <text start="2536.78" dur="11.61">now but it&amp;#39;s being investigated as</text>
  <text start="2540.28" dur="12.069">separate networks really it looks like</text>
  <text start="2548.39" dur="7.32">these networks the one coming out of</text>
  <text start="2552.349" dur="6.661">Waco Texas the one here in Florida with</text>
  <text start="2555.71" dur="7.17">the man from Pensacola the network that</text>
  <text start="2559.01" dur="7.44">had crafts as the face of it even though</text>
  <text start="2562.88" dur="7.409">he was not the head of it all of those</text>
  <text start="2566.45" dur="9.18">networks are part of the same thing</text>
  <text start="2570.289" dur="9.091">and it&amp;#39;s an international operation this</text>
  <text start="2575.63" dur="6.829">is not a national issue</text>
  <text start="2579.38" dur="11.599">it&amp;#39;s an international sex trafficking</text>
  <text start="2582.459" dur="11.941">operation that is likely being operated</text>
  <text start="2590.979" dur="6.88">with cooperate with cooperation between</text>
  <text start="2594.4" dur="6.789">folks here in the States very high-level</text>
  <text start="2597.859" dur="9.12">prominent officials if they dig hard</text>
  <text start="2601.189" dur="10.701">enough and the crime syndicate in the</text>
  <text start="2606.979" dur="4.911">Golden Triangle which is linked to China</text>
  <text start="2615.189" dur="7.53">this needs to be investigated much</text>
  <text start="2620.029" dur="6.99">further than it is already</text>
  <text start="2622.719" dur="5.95">and the thing is is I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="2627.019" dur="4.2">people have been talking about Epstein</text>
  <text start="2628.669" dur="7.17">and and he is important that he is a</text>
  <text start="2631.219" dur="10.431">significant figure in the global sex</text>
  <text start="2635.839" dur="9.99">trafficking network among the elites and</text>
  <text start="2641.65" dur="6.699">I&amp;#39;m working on that Network as well but</text>
  <text start="2645.829" dur="8.52">I really believe it&amp;#39;s all part of the</text>
  <text start="2648.349" dur="11.72">same thing that&amp;#39;s possible there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2654.349" dur="5.72">different branches of the same network</text>
  <text start="2661.9" dur="6.069">so while everyone is looking at Epstein</text>
  <text start="2665.659" dur="3.96">and Harvey Weinstein because they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="2667.969" dur="2.79">big names and everybody wants to talk</text>
  <text start="2669.619" dur="5.46">about them and not that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2670.759" dur="6.99">important because they are but there is</text>
  <text start="2675.079" dur="7.68">also this other network that has a</text>
  <text start="2677.749" dur="8.93">history of decades connected to the</text>
  <text start="2682.759" dur="6.54">Golden Triangle China is the real enemy</text>
  <text start="2686.679" dur="4.12">not Russia like the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="2689.299" dur="3.091">wants us to think everything is about</text>
  <text start="2690.799" dur="4.11">Russia to them Russia Russia Russia</text>
  <text start="2692.39" dur="6.269">don&amp;#39;t look over here at China please</text>
  <text start="2694.909" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t look over here at Russia we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2698.659" dur="3.96">gonna scream about Russia on the</text>
  <text start="2700.519" dur="4.881">rooftops but we&amp;#39;re not even gonna look</text>
  <text start="2702.619" dur="2.781">at China at all</text>
  <text start="2706.309" dur="6.49">and the thing about these smaller</text>
  <text start="2710.599" dur="4.42">networks when you look at these</text>
  <text start="2712.799" dur="5.25">individuals like the man from Pensacola</text>
  <text start="2715.019" dur="5.49">who really has a name that has no fame</text>
  <text start="2718.049" dur="7.29">whatsoever other than the fact that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2720.509" dur="8.85">in the news now even alternative media</text>
  <text start="2725.339" dur="6.121">doesn&amp;#39;t care about that why because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2729.359" dur="9.781">not famous nobody knows about him nobody</text>
  <text start="2731.46" dur="9.569">knows who he is at all but see that does</text>
  <text start="2739.14" dur="4.56">not diminish the importance of that</text>
  <text start="2741.029" dur="5.07">network because how it&amp;#39;s supposed to</text>
  <text start="2743.7" dur="4.559">work if you want to catch bigger fish</text>
  <text start="2746.099" dur="8.13">you have to use the smaller fish to get</text>
  <text start="2748.259" dur="12">them that man in Pensacola is not the</text>
  <text start="2754.229" dur="10.681">head of that Network I guarantee it he</text>
  <text start="2760.259" dur="7.98">is just a small fish we need to use him</text>
  <text start="2764.91" dur="6.24">to get to the bigger fish they need to</text>
  <text start="2768.239" dur="4.59">look at that Network beyond that man</text>
  <text start="2771.15" dur="3.329">because it&amp;#39;s much bigger than that</text>
  <text start="2772.829" dur="5.071">especially when you take all of these</text>
  <text start="2774.479" dur="6.211">networks together like I just said it is</text>
  <text start="2777.9" dur="6.389">not a coincidence that we have officers</text>
  <text start="2780.69" dur="5.609">going from Waco to New York because they</text>
  <text start="2784.289" dur="4.351">followed a lead there it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="2786.299" dur="4.92">coincidence that also when you look at</text>
  <text start="2788.64" dur="5.849">this network from this guy in Pensacola</text>
  <text start="2791.219" dur="5.01">that he was getting his inventory</text>
  <text start="2794.489" dur="5.641">because that&amp;#39;s really what these sex</text>
  <text start="2796.229" dur="11.01">trafficking victims were to them from</text>
  <text start="2800.13" dur="11.719">New York and from there they had been</text>
  <text start="2807.239" dur="4.61">coming from China in Southeast Asia</text>
  <text start="2812.45" dur="9.909">these are not coincidences and it</text>
  <text start="2816.96" dur="8.22">deserves our attention ok so anyway</text>
  <text start="2822.359" dur="4.531">that&amp;#39;s all I have for today I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="2825.18" dur="4.649">to make this video too long but I wanted</text>
  <text start="2826.89" dur="5.25">to really try to present this in a way</text>
  <text start="2829.829" dur="5.421">that you can see where the pattern is</text>
  <text start="2832.14" dur="5.75">where that network is going</text>
