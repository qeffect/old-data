  <text start="0.829" dur="5.53">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="3.659" dur="5.52">most of destiny most calm there is a</text>
  <text start="6.359" dur="5.91">plot afoot to cause division within the</text>
  <text start="9.179" dur="5.191">QED community and I think I&amp;#39;ve nailed it</text>
  <text start="12.269" dur="5.401">I want to tell you guys kind of what I</text>
  <text start="14.37" dur="5.37">found in the last few days now as many</text>
  <text start="17.67" dur="3.6">of you may know I&amp;#39;ve been around the Q</text>
  <text start="19.74" dur="5.19">community since the very beginning and</text>
  <text start="21.27" dur="7.05">I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve been here royally working for</text>
  <text start="24.93" dur="5.999">POTUS and Q so to speak directly taking</text>
  <text start="28.32" dur="4.47">my directives from from the post more or</text>
  <text start="30.929" dur="3.931">less as far as what areas I focused on</text>
  <text start="32.79" dur="4.14">for quite a while and you know we felt</text>
  <text start="34.86" dur="4.23">this Q movement into something major I</text>
  <text start="36.93" dur="3.899">take no credit for that but my audience</text>
  <text start="39.09" dur="3.57">deserves a good portion of the credit</text>
  <text start="40.829" dur="3.841">for what has happened within the key</text>
  <text start="42.66" dur="3.78">moment because we were there in the</text>
  <text start="44.67" dur="4.38">beginning and these folks have spread</text>
  <text start="46.44" dur="5.04">that news quite a bit not me I just show</text>
  <text start="49.05" dur="6.689">up to talk on YouTube but you know we we</text>
  <text start="51.48" dur="6.21">brought a large impact to this cause and</text>
  <text start="55.739" dur="4.05">you know the cause of that we have a</text>
  <text start="57.69" dur="3.84">voice at the table when it comes to</text>
  <text start="59.789" dur="3.511">these matters of queuing on and and</text>
  <text start="61.53" dur="4.409">that&amp;#39;s before the book and all this</text>
  <text start="63.3" dur="4.109">other stuff about whatever we had</text>
  <text start="65.939" dur="5.701">already earned that place at the table</text>
  <text start="67.409" dur="6.661">now my strength and my one of my focuses</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="6.18">after Q started talking about fake manga</text>
  <text start="74.07" dur="6.45">was that I was not afraid to you know</text>
  <text start="77.82" dur="4.2">punch right if that was the case that</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="3.69">these people were deceiving now I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="82.02" dur="4.56">exposed numerous fake manga I&amp;#39;ve shown</text>
  <text start="84.21" dur="4.589">in real-time videos how their tactics</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="3.96">work I&amp;#39;ve talked about people like some</text>
  <text start="88.799" dur="4.11">of the more prominent examples like the</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="5.009">sobic and and I would even contend Alex</text>
  <text start="92.909" dur="3.96">Jones but and we&amp;#39;ll see where he&amp;#39;s at on</text>
  <text start="95.549" dur="3.061">this now because he seems to be coming</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="3.601">back around or not I don&amp;#39;t know write</text>
  <text start="98.61" dur="2.16">threats and then and then please I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="100.47" dur="2.82">know</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="4.5">but basically Poe sobic and his fake</text>
  <text start="103.29" dur="4.289">chat logs was sort of the epitome of the</text>
  <text start="105.27" dur="4.919">anti Q propaganda right they supposedly</text>
  <text start="107.579" dur="5.491">debunked Q with these made-up chat logs</text>
  <text start="110.189" dur="5.581">and then of course I&amp;#39;ve debunked a sobic</text>
  <text start="113.07" dur="5.22">and Q shared my work and I kind of took</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="4.47">that as a pat on the head and and a good</text>
  <text start="118.29" dur="4.079">work and keep up what you&amp;#39;re doing so</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="3.36">you know so to some degree even though</text>
  <text start="122.369" dur="4.981">that sounds kind of stupid and childish</text>
  <text start="123.6" dur="5.79">I I was I felt like you had appreciated</text>
  <text start="127.35" dur="3.48">this aspect of what I was doing and</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="2.91">that&amp;#39;s why he called attention to it</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="1.71">because it was a terrible video let&amp;#39;s be</text>
  <text start="132.3" dur="2.279">on</text>
  <text start="132.54" dur="3.63">my work was I&amp;#39;m really bad with the</text>
  <text start="134.579" dur="4.591">technology I&amp;#39;m learning right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.17" dur="4.53">what we have all this stuff here but at</text>
  <text start="139.17" dur="5.189">the time I was really bad and this was a</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="6.45">very poorly made video but Hugh still</text>
  <text start="144.359" dur="5.52">mentioned it now for me that was a quest</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="5.729">and I started going after the fake</text>
  <text start="149.879" dur="5.131">market even more than ever and because</text>
  <text start="152.879" dur="4.17">of that I have a whole bunch of pages on</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="4.44">destiny most calm dedicated to what I</text>
  <text start="157.049" dur="4.53">found and it&amp;#39;s not you know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="3.81">lot more to go there&amp;#39;s extensively other</text>
  <text start="161.579" dur="6.541">areas we could dig into I even have a</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="6.27">fake news section but but because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="168.12" dur="3.119">been watching them and because I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="169.53" dur="4.26">learning their ways and exposing the</text>
  <text start="171.239" dur="5.071">fake Magga I&amp;#39;ve gotten a reputation for</text>
  <text start="173.79" dur="4.77">being a bit of a drama queen because I</text>
  <text start="176.31" dur="4.079">will pick fights with these guys I will</text>
  <text start="178.56" dur="4.14">expose them as liars now I&amp;#39;ll do it as</text>
  <text start="180.389" dur="3.901">you know politely and I do it from a</text>
  <text start="182.7" dur="3.45">debate and from a reason from an</text>
  <text start="184.29" dur="4.319">evidence and from a kindness and</text>
  <text start="186.15" dur="5.16">compassion perspective but I will pick</text>
  <text start="188.609" dur="4.5">the fight for example I asked Pacific</text>
  <text start="191.31" dur="3.239">for a debate on the queue and on thing</text>
  <text start="193.109" dur="2.671">and this is before his big chat log</text>
  <text start="194.549" dur="3.72">reveal back when he was still saying</text>
  <text start="195.78" dur="4.049">McCain was queuing on right and I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="198.269" dur="3">it all on the website and I asked him</text>
  <text start="199.829" dur="3.81">politely I still respected him at the</text>
  <text start="201.269" dur="6">time for a for a debate and he doxed me</text>
  <text start="203.639" dur="6.06">all right so hey Pacific I&amp;#39;ve gotten a</text>
  <text start="207.269" dur="4.71">year of great use out of your story</text>

  <text start="217.739" dur="5.4">Breitbart said to walk through that fire</text>
  <text start="219.319" dur="5.5">now that said especially in today&amp;#39;s era</text>
  <text start="223.139" dur="3.06">because this is just like trophies I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="224.819" dur="3.871">collecting these things actually they&amp;#39;d</text>

  <text start="1265.99" dur="4.05">and until he starts talking and</text>
  <text start="1267.669" dur="3.961">attacking and that kind of thing and and</text>
  <text start="1270.04" dur="3.629">generally speaking I feel like she&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1271.63" dur="3.72">disturbed person and I wouldn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1273.669" dur="4.5">bring attention to this except that she</text>
  <text start="1275.35" dur="4.98">spends about at the time at least eight</text>

  <text start="1280.33" dur="3.27">through this in the video I show you</text>
  <text start="1281.74" dur="5.01">what she&amp;#39;s doing in a tactics as she</text>
  <text start="1283.6" dur="8.55">does it&amp;#39;s mental really it is it seems</text>
  <text start="1286.75" dur="8.04">to be and and by that I mean it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="1292.15" dur="4.44">like the cut the cry bully stuff it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1294.79" dur="4.019">built into the character of the nature</text>
  <text start="1296.59" dur="3.36">like the leftist but then they start to</text>
  <text start="1298.809" dur="2.851">pretend to be Trump people and they</text>
  <text start="1299.95" dur="3.719">start to pretend to be this and that and</text>
  <text start="1301.66" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re not really Q people and then</text>
  <text start="1303.669" dur="3.541">that you start to see that that sort of</text>
  <text start="1305.11" dur="3.87">mental focus</text>
  <text start="1307.21" dur="3.54">being a victim of being tribal to come</text>
  <text start="1308.98" dur="3.75">out in the way that they act men behave</text>
  <text start="1310.75" dur="4.919">so there was a lot of that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1312.73" dur="4.65">veterans for truth you know they come up</text>
  <text start="1315.669" dur="4.411">with these great names like Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1317.38" dur="9.33">right there&amp;#39;s the Federalist and I say</text>
  <text start="1320.08" dur="12.42">this because there was quite a bit of</text>
  <text start="1326.71" dur="14.91">this linking them to attacking people on</text>
  <text start="1332.5" dur="11.669">our side and what was that last one</text>
  <text start="1341.62" dur="3.09">there Judge Napolitano and WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="1344.169" dur="2.851">Twitter</text>
  <text start="1344.71" dur="4.02">so yeah judge now remember he&amp;#39;s turned</text>
  <text start="1347.02" dur="6.24">anti Trump or maybe he&amp;#39;s coming back</text>
  <text start="1348.73" dur="6.21">around but uh he was a hero of mine too</text>
  <text start="1353.26" dur="3.75">I wanted him to be the next Supreme</text>
  <text start="1354.94" dur="3.719">Court guy and then the WikiLeaks Twitter</text>
  <text start="1357.01" dur="3.84">account right because WikiLeaks was</text>
  <text start="1358.659" dur="4.851">compromised and I it&amp;#39;s my assessment it</text>
  <text start="1360.85" dur="5.97">was in cohesion and and it coincide with</text>
  <text start="1363.51" dur="5.08">as they silenced Assange why do I say</text>
  <text start="1366.82" dur="3.75">that remember the guy that worked</text>
  <text start="1368.59" dur="4.13">high-level with WikiLeaks as a tech guy</text>
  <text start="1370.57" dur="4.29">they found his laptop and stuff like it</text>
  <text start="1372.72" dur="3.939">floating around in the water or</text>
  <text start="1374.86" dur="5.039">something like that and they they were</text>
  <text start="1376.659" dur="4.74">not able to find the body so we know</text>
  <text start="1379.899" dur="4.081">what happened to him he was disappeared</text>
  <text start="1381.399" dur="4.321">in the ocean probably and then WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="1383.98" dur="3.27">account started going back on things</text>
  <text start="1385.72" dur="4.589">that they had previously said that were</text>
  <text start="1387.25" dur="5.039">true like they had made pizza gate</text>
  <text start="1390.309" dur="3.301">statements and in favor that it you know</text>
  <text start="1392.289" dur="3.661">some of the pedophilia stuff was really</text>
  <text start="1393.61" dur="3.6">legitimately going on before and then</text>
  <text start="1395.95" dur="4.76">afterwards they backtracked on these</text>
  <text start="1397.21" dur="6.589">statements so that was very strange so</text>
  <text start="1400.71" dur="6.04">and then this question like trying to</text>
  <text start="1403.799" dur="4.811">request a poll of whether or not the</text>
  <text start="1406.75" dur="5.25">rest of the world should declare a Nancy</text>
  <text start="1408.61" dur="5.39">Pelosi the interim president I mean this</text>
  <text start="1412" dur="4.74">is the kind of stuff that we we saw</text>
  <text start="1414" dur="4.96">shift in WikiLeaks ESA&amp;#39;s the patterns</text>
  <text start="1416.74" dur="4.5">that I look for when I try to spot fake</text>
  <text start="1418.96" dur="2.49">manga and I try to bring that to you</text>
  <text start="1421.24" dur="5.159">guys</text>
  <text start="1421.45" dur="6.81">so that&amp;#39;s kind of where we are now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1426.399" dur="3.211">gonna get back to shift in my office in</text>
  <text start="1428.26" dur="2.519">studio back in the other room because</text>
  <text start="1429.61" dur="3.449">this is just not working</text>
  <text start="1430.779" dur="3.63">no wasting audio and the baby crying and</text>
  <text start="1433.059" dur="5.071">everything it doesn&amp;#39;t work very well out</text>
  <text start="1434.409" dur="6.301">here but you guys be well and</text>
  <text start="1438.13" dur="4.62">this is this is not a fun topic to go</text>
  <text start="1440.71" dur="3.48">into right because this involves picking</text>
  <text start="1442.75" dur="2.22">fights and people that are supposed to</text>
  <text start="1444.19" dur="3.66">be on our team</text>
  <text start="1444.97" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s controversial it&amp;#39;s uncomfortable it</text>
  <text start="1447.85" dur="4.68">feels combative and and no one likes</text>
  <text start="1450.7" dur="3.51">that like we all prefer to go after the</text>
  <text start="1452.53" dur="3.09">easy targets the Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="1454.21" dur="3.57">corrupt the people that are obviously</text>
  <text start="1455.62" dur="3.69">black and we are obviously white and I</text>
  <text start="1457.78" dur="4.23">mean that in terms of black versus white</text>
  <text start="1459.31" dur="3.84">as an evil good not in terms of race or</text>
  <text start="1462.01" dur="4.14">anything else which is more of a round</text>
  <text start="1463.15" dur="5.61">thing anyway so we have a black hat and</text>
  <text start="1466.15" dur="4.83">a white hat world and then we also have</text>
  <text start="1468.76" dur="4.35">these ambiguous figures that are</text>
  <text start="1470.98" dur="4.17">supposed to be line hats but are in fact</text>
  <text start="1473.11" dur="4.11">not I think they call them black eyes or</text>
  <text start="1475.15" dur="3.6">something right like like you you have</text>
  <text start="1477.22" dur="3.54">your black eye but your white hat or</text>
  <text start="1478.75" dur="4.92">something I don&amp;#39;t know or maybe that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1480.76" dur="4.71">the one that&amp;#39;s like really the guy who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1483.67" dur="3.36">on the bad guys team is actually a good</text>
  <text start="1485.47" dur="3.75">guy I don&amp;#39;t remember right there&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="1487.03" dur="3.72">many of these freaking terms but there</text>
  <text start="1489.22" dur="4.59">is a good and evil but then there are</text>
  <text start="1490.75" dur="5.19">also I would say the most evil of all</text>
  <text start="1493.81" dur="4.35">which of the people pretending to be</text>
  <text start="1495.94" dur="4.85">good and those are the people I</text>
  <text start="1498.16" dur="4.95">unfortunately have been called to fight</text>
  <text start="1500.79" dur="5.53">those are the people unfortunately that</text>
  <text start="1503.11" dur="5.67">cue has tasked me to deal with at least</text>
  <text start="1506.32" dur="4.2">that&amp;#39;s how I felt right and that is</text>
  <text start="1508.78" dur="3.9">unfortunately something I&amp;#39;m good at</text>
  <text start="1510.52" dur="5.88">because I will walk through the fire and</text>
  <text start="1512.68" dur="5.28">I am Not Afraid of the fight so if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1516.4" dur="4.2">starting some drama with people that you</text>
  <text start="1517.96" dur="4.17">like please get both sides of it because</text>
  <text start="1520.6" dur="4.91">I would not start that drama otherwise</text>
  <text start="1522.13" dur="7.29">and not without great cause and</text>
  <text start="1525.51" dur="6.49">generally speaking it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1529.42" dur="3.81">bad going if it&amp;#39;s in the case of Joanne</text>

  <text start="1851.11" dur="3.9">what he&amp;#39;s saying because basically</text>
  <text start="1852.49" dur="5.61">cereal companies do the exact same thing</text>
  <text start="1855.01" dur="4.38">all the time any like cereal boxes will</text>

  <text start="1859.39" dur="3.81">information passwords and stuff in there</text>
  <text start="1861.19" dur="4.23">and you pay for that it&amp;#39;s part of the</text>

  <text start="1865.42" dur="3.39">something</text>

  <text start="1868.81" dur="4.08">every McDonald&amp;#39;s has ever served a</text>
  <text start="1870.22" dur="4.35">secret decoder ring then then that would</text>
  <text start="1872.89" dur="3.78">make sense but obviously these people</text>
  <text start="1874.57" dur="3.87">operate on fear and threats and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1876.67" dur="8.07">all I got and might dude you&amp;#39;re a joke</text>
  <text start="1878.44" dur="7.47">we don&amp;#39;t really care anyway anyone</text>
  <text start="1884.74" dur="2.82">anybody that takes that guy seriously</text>
  <text start="1885.91" dur="6.14">remember but he&amp;#39;s one of the big six</text>
  <text start="1887.56" dur="4.49">right anti Q six whatever that means</text>
  <text start="1892.68" dur="9.7">duh and then yeah for example someone</text>

  <text start="1902.38" dur="5.37">isn&amp;#39;t paid for doing their job because</text>
  <text start="1905.8" dur="3.18">this guy I mean this guy was attacking</text>
  <text start="1907.75" dur="3.03">me a lot earlier too but he says you</text>
  <text start="1908.98" dur="3">mean making money off you and on he was</text>
  <text start="1910.78" dur="2.88">the real Patriot he doesn&amp;#39;t get a penny</text>
  <text start="1911.98" dur="3.33">looks like the bottom feeders came out</text>
  <text start="1913.66" dur="3.87">to collect and Q&amp;#39;s name if this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1915.31" dur="3.72">stop work you&amp;#39;ll probably come out with</text>
  <text start="1917.53" dur="5.73">an American flag a bikini and start</text>
  <text start="1919.03" dur="5.58">stripping yeah I want to share this one</text>
  <text start="1923.26" dur="2.49">because why do you assume the Q&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="1924.61" dur="2.4">pay for doing her job they work for the</text>
  <text start="1925.75" dur="3.36">military clearly that would mean that</text>
  <text start="1927.01" dur="4.59">they get whatever their military rank</text>
  <text start="1929.11" dur="3.99">and pay is it&amp;#39;s probably just like a</text>
  <text start="1931.6" dur="5.07">standard pay I think you should get a</text>
  <text start="1933.1" dur="5.04">bonus personally Q if you&amp;#39;re ready to go</text>
  <text start="1936.67" dur="3.72">into the private sector buddy I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1938.14" dur="4.95">willing to help make you wealthy let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1940.39" dur="4.2">talk and I not because of me but because</text>
  <text start="1943.09" dur="4.53">of all the connections and people that</text>
  <text start="1944.59" dur="5.33">love what Q has done right so after that</text>
  <text start="1947.62" dur="4.35">the story is done these people deserve</text>
  <text start="1949.92" dur="3.13">wealth and the protection that would</text>
  <text start="1951.97" dur="2.55">come with it because it&amp;#39;s about the only</text>
  <text start="1953.05" dur="5.81">way that they&amp;#39;ll stay alive afterwards</text>
  <text start="1954.52" dur="4.34">anyway if we miss even one back</text>
  <text start="1959.62" dur="8.62">anyway did Tom see people actually think</text>
  <text start="1965.81" dur="4.34">that that I was stalking Joe because of</text>
  <text start="1968.24" dur="3.96">the impression that he&amp;#39;s given people</text>
  <text start="1970.15" dur="3.85">and that&amp;#39;s not true at all</text>
  <text start="1972.2" dur="3.51">basically the quick version would happen</text>
  <text start="1974" dur="4.17">with the Joe Situationists is it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1975.71" dur="3.09">business misconception we created a book</text>
  <text start="1978.17" dur="2.67">together</text>
  <text start="1978.8" dur="4.11">he owns a part of that book and then</text>
  <text start="1980.84" dur="4.35">also exercises his right to it because</text>
  <text start="1982.91" dur="4.47">he won&amp;#39;t let us do the audiobook and and</text>
  <text start="1985.19" dur="4.98">then he receives a part of that</text>
  <text start="1987.38" dur="4.95">percentage now I think he&amp;#39;s got it</text>
  <text start="1990.17" dur="4.05">figured out now what with the publisher</text>
  <text start="1992.33" dur="4.65">but at the time the big argument right</text>
  <text start="1994.22" dur="4.17">that they&amp;#39;re referring to was me trying</text>
  <text start="1996.98" dur="3.39">to convince him that he it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="1998.39" dur="4.77">publishers place to do his taxes for him</text>
  <text start="2000.37" dur="4.41">and him being a dick to me about it and</text>
  <text start="2003.16" dur="3.33">in fact I&amp;#39;ve already shared that email</text>
  <text start="2004.78" dur="4.29">in that video because this was months</text>
  <text start="2006.49" dur="4.05">back and frankly I&amp;#39;m tired of waiting</text>
  <text start="2009.07" dur="3.6">for an apology and I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="2010.54" dur="4.62">anymore like I still love Joe for what</text>
  <text start="2012.67" dur="3.93">he does but on the back end he&amp;#39;s treated</text>
  <text start="2015.16" dur="3.05">me very poorly and I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="2016.6" dur="4.44">associate with him unless he apologizes</text>
  <text start="2018.21" dur="4.36">and that&amp;#39;s fine but this conversation is</text>
  <text start="2021.04" dur="2.97">way bigger than that it&amp;#39;s way bigger</text>
  <text start="2022.57" dur="3.66">than that because this is something that</text>
  <text start="2024.01" dur="3.99">my crush child and others are into</text>
  <text start="2026.23" dur="10.35">they&amp;#39;re pushing it&amp;#39;s a PSYOP it&amp;#39;s an</text>
