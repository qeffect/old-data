  <text start="16.57" dur="4.89">to put President Trump in jail for</text>
  <text start="19.18" dur="4.259">20-plus years probably the remainder of</text>
  <text start="21.46" dur="4.68">his natural life I mean he&amp;#39;s an older</text>

  <text start="30.22" dur="5.91">Patriot sponsors don&amp;#39;t miss this one</text>
  <text start="33.54" dur="5.17">there was a time when I had my head in</text>
  <text start="36.13" dur="5.25">the sand then I found out that powered</text>
  <text start="38.71" dur="5.49">players passed lies for truth and truth</text>
  <text start="41.38" dur="5.55">for lies especially in areas of life and</text>

  <text start="77.26" dur="5.04">Democrats are making up charges now</text>
  <text start="79.81" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re trying to trump up some fake</text>
  <text start="82.3" dur="3.51">wire fraud charges because they had</text>
  <text start="84.01" dur="4.02">nothing right they had to have some sort</text>
  <text start="85.81" dur="3.93">of a crime to go after president Trump</text>
  <text start="88.03" dur="3.69">so this is what they&amp;#39;re doing and of</text>
  <text start="89.74" dur="5.34">course they have nothing they&amp;#39;ve got no</text>
  <text start="91.72" dur="5.25">evidence it&amp;#39;s just another malicious lie</text>
  <text start="95.08" dur="4.41">coming from folks that have been telling</text>
  <text start="96.97" dur="4.44">malicious lies for years trying to find</text>
  <text start="99.49" dur="4.35">dirt for years and still couldn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="101.41" dur="4.11">anything otherwise as we all know it</text>
  <text start="103.84" dur="3.89">would have leaked out someone like Comey</text>
  <text start="105.52" dur="4.8">would have leaked it out that</text>
  <text start="107.73" dur="4.51">self-righteous holier-than-thou lying</text>
  <text start="110.32" dur="4.5">bastard that he is I mean he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="112.24" dur="4.23">psychopath I think it&amp;#39;s my belief and</text>
  <text start="114.82" dur="3.27">I&amp;#39;m always careful about you know</text>
  <text start="116.47" dur="3.36">playing armchair psychiatrist or</text>
  <text start="118.09" dur="4.14">anything but you can tell with some</text>
  <text start="119.83" dur="4.14">people because they they lie and then</text>
  <text start="122.23" dur="3.42">they keep lying and then they get caught</text>
  <text start="123.97" dur="3.18">lying and they still continue lying and</text>
  <text start="125.65" dur="2.91">then they still pretend to be the victim</text>
  <text start="127.15" dur="3.9">after they&amp;#39;ve been caught lying and</text>
  <text start="128.56" dur="4.11">you&amp;#39;re like I can see it happening I can</text>
  <text start="131.05" dur="3.36">watch the lies I can actually go back</text>
  <text start="132.67" dur="3.63">and sequentially see all the lies you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="134.41" dur="4.98">told and then you&amp;#39;re still giving me</text>
  <text start="136.3" dur="4.89">these puppy-dog eyes as though you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="139.39" dur="3.36">this innocent victim who&amp;#39;s been bullied</text>
  <text start="141.19" dur="3.09">around by President Trump even though</text>
  <text start="142.75" dur="3.66">you&amp;#39;re trying to put the man in jail</text>
  <text start="144.28" dur="4.14">looks like now 420 the rest of his life</text>
  <text start="146.41" dur="4.35">for 20 plus years</text>
  <text start="148.42" dur="4.35">it just it&amp;#39;s insane these kind of</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="4.949">crocodile tears from these Psychopaths</text>
  <text start="152.77" dur="4.77">can ruin the world that is exactly the</text>
  <text start="155.709" dur="4.5">weapons the Communists have always used</text>
  <text start="157.54" dur="6.27">you know they they show you a starving</text>
  <text start="160.209" dur="6.181">child in Zimbabwe or something and then</text>
  <text start="163.81" dur="4.679">they say we need to end capitalism we</text>
  <text start="166.39" dur="3.72">need to end starvation of hunger we need</text>
  <text start="168.489" dur="3.961">to help these children and things like</text>
  <text start="170.11" dur="3.96">that then they probably ignore the fact</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="3.42">that this picture is probably from</text>
  <text start="174.07" dur="3.389">communist control to Ethiopia and this</text>
  <text start="175.87" dur="3.42">is probably why the child is starving</text>
  <text start="177.459" dur="3.931">and it has nothing to do with with</text>
  <text start="179.29" dur="5.97">capitalism it&amp;#39;s actually communism fault</text>
  <text start="181.39" dur="5.67">so that&amp;#39;s called an appeal to emotion</text>
  <text start="185.26" dur="3.09">for those who&amp;#39;ve been around the channel</text>
  <text start="187.06" dur="3.63">a while you know I&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="188.35" dur="6.27">debate terms and logical fallacies and</text>
  <text start="190.69" dur="5.88">how to be logical and debate and and of</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="4.05">course the most common things from the</text>
  <text start="196.57" dur="4.38">left is an ad hominem that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="4.17">instead of saying president Trump you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="200.95" dur="3.599">wrong about this they say he&amp;#39;s a racist</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="3.34">hateful bigoted because they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="204.549" dur="3.881">going after the man instead</text>
  <text start="206.18" dur="5.309">of the argument that&amp;#39;s ad hominem or</text>
  <text start="208.43" dur="4.8">against the man as it means and then</text>
  <text start="211.489" dur="3.931">there&amp;#39;s other things like appeal to</text>
  <text start="213.23" dur="3.929">ridicule and this is where they say all</text>
  <text start="215.42" dur="3.36">that queuing on movement they&amp;#39;re just a</text>
  <text start="217.159" dur="2.791">bunch of crazy cult ease there&amp;#39;s no one</text>
  <text start="218.78" dur="3.599">in there there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a fringe movement</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s not any energy behind it</text>
  <text start="222.379" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s fake you know they don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="224.81" dur="4.92">arguments right those are all subjective</text>
  <text start="227.269" dur="5.761">opinions you know fringe whatever on fox</text>
  <text start="229.73" dur="6.479">news recently on Jesse Watters an anti</text>
  <text start="233.03" dur="5.429">cube expert right the supposed expert</text>
  <text start="236.209" dur="5.191">professor from Miami whose name I keep</text>
  <text start="238.459" dur="4.89">forgetting was saying that 10% of the</text>
  <text start="241.4" dur="4.5">country thought that Q Anan was a</text>
  <text start="243.349" dur="4.23">positive thing and that&amp;#39;s not even the</text>
  <text start="245.9" dur="3.899">total numbers that are aware of it and</text>
  <text start="247.579" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s the Fox News kind of skewed</text>
  <text start="249.799" dur="3.12">numbers that barely you know they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="251.659" dur="3.151">really telling you the truth I mean</text>
  <text start="252.919" dur="5.13">according to Fox News most of the</text>
  <text start="254.81" dur="5.609">country wants impeachment so just an</text>
  <text start="258.049" dur="5.12">example of how logical fallacies work</text>
  <text start="260.419" dur="5.521">and how powerful they can be especially</text>
  <text start="263.169" dur="5.201">against the man ad homonyms because it</text>
  <text start="265.94" dur="5.009">scares people out of standing up to you</text>
  <text start="268.37" dur="4.35">for one and that&amp;#39;s the bully tactic and</text>
  <text start="270.949" dur="4.201">intimidation</text>
  <text start="272.72" dur="4.56">especially the kind of arguments of a</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="5.009">pill to ridicule because no one wants to</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="5.04">be ridiculed it&amp;#39;s worse in some ways</text>
  <text start="280.159" dur="4.44">than being the target of the hatred</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="4.5">because if they&amp;#39;re going against the man</text>
  <text start="284.599" dur="3.991">you know maybe people see that this is</text>
  <text start="286.82" dur="3.48">just some guy who hates you maybe</text>
  <text start="288.59" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s a chance that they see that and</text>
  <text start="290.3" dur="3.75">then they consider that but with appeal</text>
  <text start="292.43" dur="3.12">to ridicule you get people into the</text>
  <text start="294.05" dur="3.51">habit of thinking that&amp;#39;s ridiculous and</text>
  <text start="295.55" dur="4.619">if I&amp;#39;m near it I&amp;#39;ll be ridiculous and</text>
  <text start="297.56" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s not true at all because the real</text>
  <text start="300.169" dur="3.84">ridicule as you&amp;#39;ve seen kind of goes</text>
  <text start="302.33" dur="3.54">both ways now we actually have the</text>
  <text start="304.009" dur="4.231">arguments we have the memes we have the</text>
  <text start="305.87" dur="4.799">art and all they have is the hatred so</text>
  <text start="308.24" dur="4.709">we&amp;#39;re ridiculing justly in this case</text>
  <text start="310.669" dur="5.101">because it is an effective alternative</text>
  <text start="312.949" dur="4.261">to violence is shame and ridicule we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="315.77" dur="4.26">using this weapon that they&amp;#39;ve used</text>
  <text start="317.21" dur="5.16">against us for so long on the emotional</text>
  <text start="320.03" dur="5.79">spectrum taking back our culture it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="4.62">really amazing to see this but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.82" dur="3.3">the kind of stuff that they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="326.99" dur="3.989">there you know I&amp;#39;ve covered some of the</text>
  <text start="329.12" dur="4.049">logical fallacies here there&amp;#39;s dozens of</text>
  <text start="330.979" dur="5.641">them so if you guys want to check out</text>
  <text start="333.169" dur="5.191">your logical fallacy is dot-com I think</text>
  <text start="336.62" dur="2.94">that&amp;#39;s the website it has them all</text>
  <text start="338.36" dur="2.58">listed with little car</text>
  <text start="339.56" dur="3.99">you can download the picture with the</text>
  <text start="340.94" dur="5.1">definition and the meme on it you could</text>
  <text start="343.55" dur="4.85">what I did is I made a folder for all of</text>
  <text start="346.04" dur="6.69">my different topics of debate different</text>
  <text start="348.4" dur="5.65">memes pictures links data things I</text>
  <text start="352.73" dur="3.42">didn&amp;#39;t want to disappear from the</text>
  <text start="354.05" dur="3.57">internet when half of them have already</text>
  <text start="356.15" dur="3.93">disappeared from the internet especially</text>
  <text start="357.62" dur="3.84">my anti vaccines I took all of those</text>
  <text start="360.08" dur="4.32">things I put them into a folder on a</text>
  <text start="361.46" dur="4.23">hard drive which is like lines pretty</text>
  <text start="364.4" dur="3.18">big but you don&amp;#39;t need a big one for</text>
  <text start="365.69" dur="4.59">this because it&amp;#39;s small stuff and then I</text>
  <text start="367.58" dur="4.32">always have a backup just in case if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="370.28" dur="5.28">in a conversation with someone on the</text>
  <text start="371.9" dur="7.38">internet I can go to this topic this</text>
  <text start="375.56" dur="5.46">argument and pull up my my data or my</text>
  <text start="379.28" dur="3.27">memes or my arguments in case I</text>
  <text start="381.02" dur="2.76">forgotten them and I can reference it</text>
  <text start="382.55" dur="3.81">even in the middle of a conversation</text>
  <text start="383.78" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s how fast I&amp;#39;ve gotten at this so</text>
  <text start="386.36" dur="3.51">this is the kind of thing that you can</text>
  <text start="387.77" dur="3.3">do from home you put it on a little</text>
  <text start="389.87" dur="3.03">thumb drive or something and carry it</text>
  <text start="391.07" dur="3.96">with you if you need that way even if</text>
  <text start="392.9" dur="4.11">you can&amp;#39;t remember every topic every</text>
  <text start="395.03" dur="4.59">argument which I forget stuff all the</text>
  <text start="397.01" dur="3.42">time you can bring that back up at a</text>
  <text start="399.62" dur="2.58">moment&amp;#39;s notice</text>
  <text start="400.43" dur="3.72">and when the arguments you can win the</text>
  <text start="402.2" dur="3.839">debates I&amp;#39;m not gonna say you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="404.15" dur="3.42">convince anyone that rarely happens</text>
  <text start="406.039" dur="3.991">but maybe you can convince everyone</text>
  <text start="407.57" dur="4.56">who&amp;#39;s watching that that person&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s called a useful debate versus a</text>
  <text start="412.13" dur="3.48">useless debate anyway I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="414.38" dur="2.76">get into the topic because it&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="415.61" dur="4.71">while since I&amp;#39;ve covered that and I feel</text>
  <text start="417.14" dur="5.31">like that could help people to maybe to</text>
  <text start="420.32" dur="4.95">fight fake news in their own lives you</text>
  <text start="422.45" dur="4.8">know and if someone if someone is making</text>
  <text start="425.27" dur="4.05">fun of you point it out that&amp;#39;s not an</text>
  <text start="427.25" dur="3.66">argument brother that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a non</text>
  <text start="429.32" dur="3.21">argument that&amp;#39;s an appeal to ridicule</text>
  <text start="430.91" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re just trying to make fun of me</text>
  <text start="432.53" dur="4.65">because you got no argument if you do</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="4.2">this the appeal to ridicule stops having</text>
  <text start="437.18" dur="4.709">its power it&amp;#39;s very effective</text>
  <text start="439.01" dur="4.29">same thing with ad hominem you can make</text>
  <text start="441.889" dur="3.09">fun of someone you can say that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="443.3" dur="3.869">a bad person that there are all these</text>
  <text start="444.979" dur="3.961">terrible things but if you can&amp;#39;t prove</text>
  <text start="447.169" dur="3.541">their argument wrong shut up because</text>
  <text start="448.94" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s just ad hominem you know why are</text>
  <text start="450.71" dur="5.7">you focused on the messenger instead of</text>
  <text start="452.69" dur="6.42">the message anyway so continuing on this</text>
  <text start="456.41" dur="3.81">is a big headline but it&amp;#39;s not actually</text>
  <text start="459.11" dur="2.88">going to happen of course they have no</text>
  <text start="460.22" dur="4.949">power to do this they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="461.99" dur="5.01">to they&amp;#39;re trying to push it through and</text>
  <text start="465.169" dur="4.011">some of these Democrat especially these</text>
  <text start="467" dur="3.63">freshmen and Democrats that are in</text>
  <text start="469.18" dur="2.67">positions where they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="470.63" dur="4.22">probably lose because</text>
  <text start="471.85" dur="4.14">in Trump districts 30-plus of them some</text>
  <text start="474.85" dur="3.21">of them have already came out and said</text>
  <text start="475.99" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re gonna go ahead and walk that plank</text>
  <text start="478.06" dur="3.93">for Pelosi we&amp;#39;re gonna go ahead and dive</text>
  <text start="480.04" dur="3.81">into the shark-infested waters and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.99" dur="4.32">gonna impeach but it&amp;#39;s still just the</text>
  <text start="483.85" dur="3.78">house and in fact the Democrats are</text>
  <text start="486.31" dur="5.43">losing people that some of those folks</text>
  <text start="487.63" dur="5.61">are now van drew I think he&amp;#39;d switched</text>
  <text start="491.74" dur="3.15">over to the Republican Party or he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="493.24" dur="3.18">the process of that and he&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="494.89" dur="3.81">called a rat and a traitor and all this</text>
  <text start="496.42" dur="3.48">other stuff and then other Democrats are</text>
  <text start="498.7" dur="4.5">saying we&amp;#39;re not going to vote for this</text>
  <text start="499.9" dur="6.87">we&amp;#39;re leaving this impeachment sinking</text>
  <text start="503.2" dur="6.48">ship things like that so continuing on</text>

  <text start="1058.94" dur="4.2">percentage of togetherness and that</text>
  <text start="1061.52" dur="4.32">means the family is one unit father</text>
  <text start="1063.14" dur="5.42">mother same home two-parent households</text>
  <text start="1065.84" dur="5.76">and it gave them a higher divorce rate</text>
  <text start="1068.56" dur="4.33">than even white people and at the time</text>
  <text start="1071.6" dur="3.27">it was funny because White&amp;#39;s had a</text>
  <text start="1072.89" dur="5.22">higher divorce rate and and blacks had a</text>
  <text start="1074.87" dur="5.19">lower divorce rate and they were raising</text>
  <text start="1078.11" dur="5.04">the IQ gap so you know there there is a</text>
  <text start="1080.06" dur="5.58">genetic IQ gap it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very much</text>
  <text start="1083.15" dur="4.32">a controversial topic and I get that but</text>
  <text start="1085.64" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t believe that it&amp;#39;s based</text>
  <text start="1087.47" dur="6.6">purely on on race that you know we for</text>
  <text start="1090.41" dur="6.42">example real fast context pale people</text>
  <text start="1094.07" dur="4.859">you know northern white Europeans had to</text>
  <text start="1096.83" dur="4.11">survive in winters where they needed a</text>
  <text start="1098.929" dur="3.931">lot of extra thinking power in order to</text>
  <text start="1100.94" dur="4.26">survive you know to set food aside and</text>
  <text start="1102.86" dur="4.47">stuff whereas dark people evolved in</text>
  <text start="1105.2" dur="4.53">different ways there&amp;#39;s no way I can ever</text>
  <text start="1107.33" dur="4.17">run or jump like a Kenyan or outrun a</text>
  <text start="1109.73" dur="3.15">leopard or something there&amp;#39;s no way I</text>
  <text start="1111.5" dur="3.63">would very you know be very good at</text>
  <text start="1112.88" dur="4.71">basketball or something but we evolved</text>
  <text start="1115.13" dur="3.84">in different ways however the important</text>
  <text start="1117.59" dur="3.33">thing here people get offended by it</text>
  <text start="1118.97" dur="3.75">because they think race equals you know</text>
  <text start="1120.92" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s smarts and that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1122.72" dur="5.82">set in stone Japanese and Jewish people</text>
  <text start="1125.78" dur="4.53">have super high IQs but Jewish people</text>
  <text start="1128.54" dur="4.26">got there by breeding it you know they</text>
  <text start="1130.31" dur="4.26">started to really focus on teaching</text>
  <text start="1132.8" dur="3.78">their children to go after the business</text>
  <text start="1134.57" dur="2.58">people right so Jewish people are very</text>
  <text start="1136.58" dur="3.03">good about</text>
  <text start="1137.15" dur="4.77">being selective with their their kind of</text>
  <text start="1139.61" dur="4.8">in-house genetics of their families so</text>
  <text start="1141.92" dur="5.4">they just gotten so many IQ points very</text>
  <text start="1144.41" dur="4.38">quickly and that was happening for the</text>
  <text start="1147.32" dur="3.66">black family in the u.s. they were</text>
  <text start="1148.79" dur="3.54">closing the IQ gap between blacks and</text>
  <text start="1150.98" dur="3.69">whites whites are still lower than</text>
  <text start="1152.33" dur="4.56">Chinese and Jewish of Japanese anyway</text>
  <text start="1154.67" dur="5.1">but they were closing the IQ gap in the</text>
  <text start="1156.89" dur="5.79">nel BJ&amp;#39;s Great Society came in destroyed</text>
  <text start="1159.77" dur="4.95">all of that right and then destroyed the</text>
  <text start="1162.68" dur="5.49">family the black family which is the</text>
  <text start="1164.72" dur="5.4">cause of so much of the violence in the</text>
  <text start="1168.17" dur="4.74">game culture and stuff they replaced the</text>
  <text start="1170.12" dur="5.61">father with the state they replaced a</text>
  <text start="1172.91" dur="4.71">two-parent household with incentives</text>
  <text start="1175.73" dur="4.92">financial incentives to kick the father</text>
  <text start="1177.62" dur="6.18">out of the family and and to live off of</text>
  <text start="1180.65" dur="4.68">welfare as you get paid more and they</text>
  <text start="1183.8" dur="4.77">destroyed the whole incentive structure</text>
  <text start="1185.33" dur="5.25">so rather than strong families generally</text>
  <text start="1188.57" dur="4.08">probably Christian families you&amp;#39;re now</text>
  <text start="1190.58" dur="3.84">getting a lot of single parents a lot of</text>
  <text start="1192.65" dur="4.11">single moms a lot of interaction would</text>
  <text start="1194.42" dur="5.1">like the family court situation a lot of</text>
  <text start="1196.76" dur="5.25">abuse a lot of people stuck on the</text>
  <text start="1199.52" dur="6.75">system dependent on this system rather</text>
  <text start="1202.01" dur="5.88">than facing an opportunity of of like a</text>
  <text start="1206.27" dur="3.12">capitalist sort of system where and</text>
  <text start="1207.89" dur="2.789">that&amp;#39;s really the decision that they</text>
  <text start="1209.39" dur="3.96">come down to do you want to be poor of</text>
  <text start="1210.679" dur="4.38">the Democrats independent and kept you</text>
  <text start="1213.35" dur="4.47">know like like a slave or like like a</text>
  <text start="1215.059" dur="4.741">pet or do you want to be you know free</text>
  <text start="1217.82" dur="3.9">and have opportunity and change your</text>
  <text start="1219.8" dur="3.33">family&amp;#39;s future by busting your ass</text>
  <text start="1221.72" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s the American dream</text>
  <text start="1223.13" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s the capitalist way and everyone</text>
  <text start="1226.28" dur="3.6">in a capitalist system is paid</text>
  <text start="1228.05" dur="4.44">equivalent to the value that they give</text>
  <text start="1229.88" dur="4.89">others right so that&amp;#39;s the two options</text>
  <text start="1232.49" dur="4.47">and I know I kind of went off on a</text>
  <text start="1234.77" dur="3.96">tangent here but that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1236.96" dur="4.17">in the in the black community they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1238.73" dur="5.25">choosing the American Way rather than</text>
  <text start="1241.13" dur="6.36">the the Democrat plantation that has</text>
  <text start="1243.98" dur="5.61">destroyed them right now the I forgot to</text>
  <text start="1247.49" dur="5.04">mention the absence of fatherhood in the</text>
  <text start="1249.59" dur="4.89">black family now it&amp;#39;s like 80 percent or</text>
  <text start="1252.53" dur="4.41">something it&amp;#39;s very high it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1254.48" dur="4.92">ridiculously high very few fathers kept</text>
  <text start="1256.94" dur="3.03">around this causes problems for these</text>
  <text start="1259.4" dur="2.67">children</text>
  <text start="1259.97" dur="4.23">so they grow up angry without strong</text>
  <text start="1262.07" dur="3.45">father figures that&amp;#39;s if you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1264.2" dur="3.63">a strong father figure to hone your</text>
  <text start="1265.52" dur="4.2">toxic masculinity as they call it then</text>
  <text start="1267.83" dur="2.56">you will actually get toxic masculinity</text>
  <text start="1269.72" dur="2.32">and</text>
  <text start="1270.39" dur="3.78">gang violence and thuggery and things</text>
  <text start="1272.04" dur="4.59">like that especially if you then teach</text>
  <text start="1274.17" dur="8.16">kids to grow up on violent music that</text>
  <text start="1276.63" dur="10.17">that elevates drugs and violence and</text>
  <text start="1282.33" dur="7.05">gang culture and things like that so a</text>
  <text start="1286.8" dur="4.68">little bit of a tangent a little bit of</text>
  <text start="1289.38" dur="4.29">a rant but I hope that it gives some</text>
  <text start="1291.48" dur="4.5">context as to you know the decision that</text>
  <text start="1293.67" dur="3.99">is facing all Americans today you know</text>
  <text start="1295.98" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s not just kind of a black-white</text>
  <text start="1297.66" dur="4.44">thing but it makes sense because the</text>
  <text start="1299.94" dur="3.99">Democrats feel like they own people who</text>
  <text start="1302.1" dur="4.71">are minorities and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1303.93" dur="4.62">fair at all and I think I think from the</text>
  <text start="1306.81" dur="4.02">polls I think from the Trump movement</text>
  <text start="1308.55" dur="5.46">that the black population especially the</text>
  <text start="1310.83" dur="5.58">men have decided that this is a rigged</text>
  <text start="1314.01" dur="4.47">game they&amp;#39;re scamming us they&amp;#39;re keeping</text>
  <text start="1316.41" dur="4.89">us down they have their foot on our neck</text>
  <text start="1318.48" dur="4.59">and we want our own life we want our own</text>
  <text start="1321.3" dur="5.7">opportunity we want to be free we want</text>
  <text start="1323.07" dur="5.37">to be Americans not black white or red</text>
  <text start="1327" dur="4.44">or gray or green or whatever it may be</text>
  <text start="1328.44" dur="6.51">we want to be Americans we bleed red</text>
  <text start="1331.44" dur="6.6">white and blue so continuing on we also</text>
  <text start="1334.95" dur="6.57">have this amazing video here where Adam</text>

  <text start="1395.04" dur="4.52">American citizen he&amp;#39;s tired of watching</text>
  <text start="1396.66" dur="5.22">our president who he clearly voted for</text>
  <text start="1399.56" dur="4.03">being railroaded in this way and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1401.88" dur="3.69">gonna try to put President Trump who is</text>
  <text start="1403.59" dur="4.17">who was stood up for us who has lost</text>

  <text start="1407.76" dur="3.9">Julian Assange and that&amp;#39;s a two-year-old</text>
  <text start="1409.5" dur="3.96">number now probably a lot more probably</text>
  <text start="1411.66" dur="4.02">lost half of his billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="1413.46" dur="4.2">standing up for us he didn&amp;#39;t have to do</text>
  <text start="1415.68" dur="5.1">that could have just lived his life and</text>
  <text start="1417.66" dur="5.49">and had a great golden era for this for</text>
  <text start="1420.78" dur="4.77">his golden years but instead he chose to</text>
  <text start="1423.15" dur="4.11">take risk to risk his life now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1425.55" dur="3.63">trying to kill him they&amp;#39;re trying to put</text>
  <text start="1427.26" dur="3.66">him in jail for the rest of his life he</text>
  <text start="1429.18" dur="2.97">chose to risk his family you know</text>
  <text start="1430.92" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re targeting his family with</text>
  <text start="1432.15" dur="5.01">threats with harassment with with</text>
  <text start="1434.46" dur="4.77">targeting things like that targeting the</text>
  <text start="1437.16" dur="3.63">targeting you know so they&amp;#39;re doing all</text>
  <text start="1439.23" dur="3.36">of these things and President Trump is</text>
  <text start="1440.79" dur="3.39">sitting there just in the middle of the</text>
  <text start="1442.59" dur="3.3">road and they&amp;#39;re trying to get to us</text>
  <text start="1444.18" dur="3.06">he&amp;#39;s like that Tiananmen Square tank guy</text>
  <text start="1445.89" dur="3.87">just kind of stood in the middle of the</text>
  <text start="1447.24" dur="4.47">way and blocked all those tanks they</text>
  <text start="1449.76" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t really hate him they hate us he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1451.71" dur="3.99">just in the way and that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="1454.32" dur="2.97">people are seeing they love this</text>
  <text start="1455.7" dur="3.81">president and they will fight for him</text>
  <text start="1457.29" dur="4.32">and that includes if they try to impeach</text>
  <text start="1459.51" dur="3.75">him civil war I&amp;#39;m sure of it I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1461.61" dur="3.81">encourage violence I&amp;#39;m just saying</text>
  <text start="1463.26" dur="5.64">that&amp;#39;s what would happen and they know</text>
  <text start="1465.42" dur="5.61">it they know it too so we also have in</text>
  <text start="1468.9" dur="4.14">New York illegal immigrants lining up</text>
  <text start="1471.03" dur="4.2">around the block throughout New York to</text>
  <text start="1473.04" dur="5.1">apply for driver&amp;#39;s licenses under new</text>
  <text start="1475.23" dur="4.32">law so hey you&amp;#39;re gonna start seeing a</text>
  <text start="1478.14" dur="3.32">whole lot of illegals driving around the</text>
  <text start="1479.55" dur="5.25">country with New York licenses soon</text>
  <text start="1481.46" dur="6.46">great we also have last but not least</text>
  <text start="1484.8" dur="5.49">the Democrat IT scandal with the Awan</text>
  <text start="1487.92" dur="4.08">brothers which was kind of swept under</text>
  <text start="1490.29" dur="3.27">the rug as nothing but it was probably</text>
  <text start="1492" dur="5.31">more like a foreign intelligence</text>
  <text start="1493.56" dur="6.06">gathering operation or spying which had</text>
  <text start="1497.31" dur="3.93">access to all the dnc computers and</text>
  <text start="1499.62" dur="3.24">servers and everything else and had some</text>
  <text start="1501.24" dur="3.96">very mysterious situations with like a</text>
  <text start="1502.86" dur="4.17">laptop and anyway I don&amp;#39;t want to go</text>
  <text start="1505.2" dur="3.42">through the whole story again but and</text>
  <text start="1507.03" dur="2.94">I&amp;#39;ve covered it in the past and you can</text>
  <text start="1508.62" dur="2.23">probably find this video still on my</text>
  <text start="1509.97" dur="4.72">channel if they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1510.85" dur="5.22">removed but the Awan situation is still</text>
  <text start="1514.69" dur="4.1">going on with a secret investigation</text>
  <text start="1516.07" dur="5.46">that&amp;#39;s the important thing here so as</text>
  <text start="1518.79" dur="4.69">Judicial Watch was trying to find more</text>
  <text start="1521.53" dur="5.79">Freedom of Information Act request</text>
  <text start="1523.48" dur="6.21">information they basically at first told</text>
  <text start="1527.32" dur="4.77">them that it was lost kind of a fib and</text>
  <text start="1529.69" dur="4.38">then later they or they said technical</text>
  <text start="1532.09" dur="3.6">difficulties and then later they said</text>
  <text start="1534.07" dur="4.5">that it was actually in regard to a</text>
  <text start="1535.69" dur="4.86">secret trial so there is our secret</text>
  <text start="1538.57" dur="3.99">investigation that is going so that</text>
  <text start="1540.55" dur="4.32">tells you right there that the Awan</text>
  <text start="1542.56" dur="4.68">scandal is not over some of this stuff</text>
  <text start="1544.87" dur="4.29">was just snapped up probably by Barr and</text>
  <text start="1547.24" dur="3.9">others doing the investigations and and</text>
  <text start="1549.16" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s just a quiet hush going on</text>
  <text start="1551.14" dur="2.19">because these investigations are still</text>
  <text start="1552.91" dur="3.09">pending</text>
  <text start="1553.33" dur="4.98">I think the Awan brothers and debbie</text>
  <text start="1556" dur="4.56">Wasserman Schultz is there in trouble</text>
  <text start="1558.31" dur="5.04">debbie Wasserman Schultz is one of the</text>
  <text start="1560.56" dur="4.53">most evil characters within the DNC she</text>

  <text start="1570.43" dur="3.78">another state but didn&amp;#39;t leave the state</text>
  <text start="1572.17" dur="4.08">until after the hospital visited four or</text>
  <text start="1574.21" dur="3.78">five in the morning where her and the</text>
