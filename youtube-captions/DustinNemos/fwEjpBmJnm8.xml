  <text start="123.74" dur="5.189">Scott had actually brought to my</text>
  <text start="126.709" dur="4.741">attention the story of Ecuador now</text>
  <text start="128.929" dur="4.981">here&amp;#39;s the thing anytime you guys make</text>
  <text start="131.45" dur="3.93">comments I read every single one and if</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s an issue there that I have not</text>
  <text start="135.38" dur="4.17">seen and you want me to bring up then</text>
  <text start="137.66" dur="4.23">I&amp;#39;ll definitely look into it so this is</text>
  <text start="139.55" dur="4.799">one of those cases I had not heard of</text>
  <text start="141.89" dur="4.319">these protests because at the time they</text>
  <text start="144.349" dur="4.291">really weren&amp;#39;t in the news that much</text>
  <text start="146.209" dur="4.471">until actually that very day even though</text>
  <text start="148.64" dur="4.77">these protests have been going on since</text>
  <text start="150.68" dur="6.389">the 3rd and actually it&amp;#39;s been building</text>
  <text start="153.41" dur="7.23">up since before that but again they</text>
  <text start="157.069" dur="4.771">don&amp;#39;t want you to see it now I will say</text>
  <text start="160.64" dur="6.67">this</text>
  <text start="161.84" dur="6.79">now that the protests are set to end or</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="4.55">at least that&amp;#39;s how it looks because</text>
  <text start="168.63" dur="7.14">they have now reached a deal the media</text>
  <text start="171.86" dur="8.14">the last couple of days has had to write</text>
  <text start="175.77" dur="6.54">about this story I have looked at a lot</text>
  <text start="180" dur="7.44">of the articles on this story I&amp;#39;ve read</text>
  <text start="182.31" dur="9.42">a lot of things on this story and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="187.44" dur="6.75">actually read articles on the mainstream</text>
  <text start="191.73" dur="4.44">media as well as alternative media like</text>
  <text start="194.19" dur="6.019">more conservative sites and I will say</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="8.34">this that they&amp;#39;re not being entirely</text>
  <text start="200.209" dur="6.791">forthcoming or truthful about the real</text>
  <text start="204.51" dur="5.49">reason why these protests were happening</text>
  <text start="207" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re giving a very shallow overview</text>
  <text start="210" dur="4.47">of what these protests were exactly what</text>
  <text start="212.4" dur="5.82">they did with the yellow vest protesters</text>
  <text start="214.47" dur="6.36">where they said oh it was a gas tax it</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="7.049">was the gas prices that&amp;#39;s not what it</text>
  <text start="220.83" dur="8.07">was so I&amp;#39;m going to talk about what this</text>
  <text start="225.269" dur="6.121">actually was and I&amp;#39;m going to explain</text>
  <text start="228.9" dur="5.76">how what this has to do with the United</text>
  <text start="231.39" dur="7.05">Nations but first I want to touch on</text>
  <text start="234.66" dur="4.829">some other stories for today so the</text>
  <text start="238.44" dur="3.74">first one I didn&amp;#39;t want to talk about</text>
  <text start="239.489" dur="5.161">here is of course Reseda to leave so</text>
  <text start="242.18" dur="4.63">recently she was at a town hall meeting</text>
  <text start="244.65" dur="4.98">and she was joking about how they would</text>
  <text start="246.81" dur="4.32">round up those who were part of the</text>
  <text start="249.63" dur="4.56">Trump administration who weren&amp;#39;t willing</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="6.24">to quote cooperates well apparently that</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="5.669">was not really a joke and so in a recent</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="4.589">interview after that Town Hall she had</text>
  <text start="259.859" dur="4.321">doubled down on that statement saying</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="4.531">that yes they were talking about the</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="4.56">logistics of how it would go down and</text>
  <text start="266.49" dur="3.84">where they would hold them and of course</text>
  <text start="268.74" dur="4.35">she&amp;#39;s not the only one who is saying</text>
  <text start="270.33" dur="5.01">that and in fact another representative</text>
  <text start="273.09" dur="3.75">had said that they would put them in a</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="6.09">little jail so that they could quote</text>
  <text start="276.84" dur="6.389">cool off like their children or</text>
  <text start="281.43" dur="4.71">something just because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="283.229" dur="5.791">to cooperate in your fake investigation</text>
  <text start="286.14" dur="5.03">and your fake impeachment inquiry which</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="4.47">is really a coup</text>
  <text start="291.17" dur="6.7">because you have no grounds for</text>
  <text start="293.49" dur="7.17">impeachment they are digging digging</text>
  <text start="297.87" dur="4.74">digging for a way to get President Trump</text>
  <text start="300.66" dur="9.03">out of office and it&amp;#39;s not going to work</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="11.31">so this woman means to be out of office</text>
  <text start="309.69" dur="7.65">the only thing that she has done is try</text>
  <text start="313.92" dur="5.91">to push this impeachment issue she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.34" dur="4.74">done nothing productive whatsoever same</text>
  <text start="319.83" dur="4.47">thing can be said for so many others in</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="5.82">that party especially part of the squat</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="6.57">the only thing that we really know about</text>
  <text start="327.9" dur="6.12">the squad is that they are engaged in</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="5.07">criminal activity for example</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="6">Ilhan Omar and her immigration and</text>
  <text start="335.94" dur="7.35">marriage fraud as well as rashida the</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="5.25">Lieb and her committing fraud in order</text>
  <text start="343.29" dur="3.96">for her to run for election in her</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="7.23">district which really wasn&amp;#39;t her</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="7.23">district at all and opposition those are</text>
  <text start="352.5" dur="6.87">the only things so these are the people</text>
  <text start="354.48" dur="7.56">we need to vote out now while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.37" dur="5.07">screaming about a fake impeachment</text>
  <text start="362.04" dur="5.91">inquiry and how the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="364.44" dur="6.39">needs to cooperate with them in the</text>
  <text start="367.95" dur="6.99">meantime we have a real investigation</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="5.7">that is ongoing right now we have the IG</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="5.01">report that is set to come out</text>
  <text start="376.53" dur="4.77">apparently on Friday so Maria Bartiromo</text>
  <text start="379.95" dur="5.49">I think I pronounced her name right</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="6.93">Maria Bartiromo has said that Friday</text>
  <text start="385.44" dur="5.4">this Friday upcoming October 18th is</text>
  <text start="388.23" dur="4.53">when the IG report on the FISA abuse</text>
  <text start="390.84" dur="4.98">will be released and she says that</text>
  <text start="392.76" dur="5.07">there&amp;#39;s so much more beyond it justifies</text>
  <text start="395.82" dur="5.61">abuse that&amp;#39;s in that report and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="397.83" dur="6.42">actually as thick as a telephone book</text>
  <text start="401.43" dur="5.04">imagine the pages and managing the</text>
  <text start="404.25" dur="5.31">information that is within that report</text>
  <text start="406.47" dur="6.6">now obviously that report does not</text>
  <text start="409.56" dur="7.08">result in charges or indictments it can</text>
  <text start="413.07" dur="6.21">however make recommendations but it</text>
  <text start="416.64" dur="6.029">really is just an internal review now</text>
  <text start="419.28" dur="4.8">what it does do is it demonstrates the</text>
  <text start="422.669" dur="3.96">fact that yes there</text>
  <text start="424.08" dur="5.28">or FISA abuses so it shows that but it</text>
  <text start="426.629" dur="4.801">cannot bring charges now what can bring</text>
  <text start="429.36" dur="4.35">charges is the investigation that</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="4.41">William bar and John Durham are involved</text>
  <text start="433.71" dur="5.25">in right now and of course we know that</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="5.4">the scope has been widened and that</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;ve been globe-trotting all over</text>
  <text start="441.24" dur="6.389">speaking with other intelligence from</text>
  <text start="445.11" dur="4.739">other countries gathering up information</text>
  <text start="447.629" dur="5.01">so that they can really make this</text>
  <text start="449.849" dur="5.79">investigation airtight so that they can</text>
  <text start="452.639" dur="5.4">actually bring charges that will stick</text>
  <text start="455.639" dur="4.261">because we cannot let these people get</text>
  <text start="458.039" dur="4.171">away with it and if they can weasel out</text>
  <text start="459.9" dur="4.919">of it they will so we have to make sure</text>
  <text start="462.21" dur="4.44">that the eyes eyes are dotted and that</text>
  <text start="464.819" dur="3.72">the T&amp;#39;s are crossed and that is exactly</text>
  <text start="466.65" dur="4.199">what William bar and Durham are doing</text>
  <text start="468.539" dur="5.581">also in addition to that we cannot</text>
  <text start="470.849" dur="4.711">forget that we have who Burr who is also</text>
  <text start="474.12" dur="3.599">doing an investigation but his</text>
  <text start="475.56" dur="4.38">investigation is centered on the Clinton</text>
  <text start="477.719" dur="3.901">Foundation and their crimes so there are</text>
  <text start="479.94" dur="3.719">several things going on right now and</text>
  <text start="481.62" dur="3.87">those are real investigations not fake</text>
  <text start="483.659" dur="3.931">investigations like this impeachment</text>
  <text start="485.49" dur="4.32">inquiry that now the White House has</text>
  <text start="487.59" dur="4.919">said that it will not cooperate with and</text>
  <text start="489.81" dur="6.359">he has every right not to cooperate with</text>
  <text start="492.509" dur="6">it because it is a fake investigation so</text>
  <text start="496.169" dur="4.5">I will be looking forward to the release</text>
  <text start="498.509" dur="5.011">of this IG report hopefully it&amp;#39;s not as</text>
  <text start="500.669" dur="5.43">redacted as the FISA report from before</text>
  <text start="503.52" dur="8.429">which was heavily heavily heavily</text>
  <text start="506.099" dur="7.68">redacted okay and other news I just want</text>
  <text start="511.949" dur="4.941">to highlight this really quick of course</text>
  <text start="513.779" dur="6.421">so we had Trump rally in Minneapolis</text>
  <text start="516.89" dur="6.37">several days ago and at the same time</text>
  <text start="520.2" dur="6.509">because that rally was there first</text>
  <text start="523.26" dur="6">Avenue decided to protest the rally by</text>
  <text start="526.709" dur="6.391">donating 18 thousand dollars to Planned</text>
  <text start="529.26" dur="7.769">Parenthood how is that protesting</text>
  <text start="533.1" dur="9.979">president Trump donating specifically to</text>
  <text start="537.029" dur="6.05">Planned Parenthood are you kidding me</text>
  <text start="543.829" dur="7.411">this just shows the Democratic agenda</text>
  <text start="547.05" dur="6.51">because really if you want to protest</text>
  <text start="551.24" dur="4.959">President Trump if that is your real</text>
  <text start="553.56" dur="4.12">goal and you know they&amp;#39;re putting up a</text>
  <text start="556.199" dur="4.74">sign that says vote 2020</text>
  <text start="557.68" dur="6.959">okay then donate that money to a</text>
  <text start="560.939" dur="5.5">Democratic campaign oh wait</text>
  <text start="564.639" dur="5.25">Planned Parenthood is a democratic</text>
  <text start="566.439" dur="11.07">campaign and they&amp;#39;re also throwing 46</text>
  <text start="569.889" dur="13.17">million dollars at 20:20 elections this</text>
  <text start="577.509" dur="7.231">is just more evidence to the Thais that</text>
  <text start="583.059" dur="5.7">Planned Parenthood and the Democrats</text>
  <text start="584.74" dur="13.949">have Planned Parenthood is a political</text>
  <text start="588.759" dur="12.51">organization they are lobbyists pure and</text>
  <text start="598.689" dur="6.57">simple they are not a health care</text>
  <text start="601.269" dur="7.29">organization centered on women&amp;#39;s rights</text>
  <text start="605.259" dur="5.64">and access to reproductive health care</text>
  <text start="608.559" dur="5.041">it&amp;#39;s not about that they want to</text>
  <text start="610.899" dur="6.92">continue their activities so that they</text>
  <text start="613.6" dur="8.7">can profit off of the sale of baby parts</text>
  <text start="617.819" dur="8.981">that&amp;#39;s what they want to do and the</text>
  <text start="622.3" dur="8.19">public is so indoctrinated into this</text>
  <text start="626.8" dur="6.36">idea that Planned Parenthood is a</text>
  <text start="630.49" dur="8.519">benevolent human rights organization</text>
  <text start="633.16" dur="8.729">that they don&amp;#39;t see that really it is</text>
  <text start="639.009" dur="8.55">just in the business of exploitation for</text>
  <text start="641.889" dur="9.24">profit they cannot see it they cannot</text>
  <text start="647.559" dur="7.921">see the matrix and here&amp;#39;s the thing when</text>
  <text start="651.129" dur="7.221">it comes to individuals who are on the</text>
  <text start="655.48" dur="2.87">other side of the aisle</text>
  <text start="659.279" dur="7.87">some of them do understand what the real</text>
  <text start="664.809" dur="6.57">purpose of Planned Parenthood is they do</text>
  <text start="667.149" dur="6.511">understand the real agenda of the</text>
  <text start="671.379" dur="5.18">Democrats of the globalists cuz it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="673.66" dur="5.099">just a Democrat thing there are</text>
  <text start="676.559" dur="3.431">Republicans who are in on the agenda</text>
  <text start="678.759" dur="3.711">that&amp;#39;s why we have something called</text>
  <text start="679.99" dur="2.48">Rhino&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="683.62" dur="4.18">but there are those who understand the</text>
  <text start="686.24" dur="4.079">agenda and then there are those who</text>
  <text start="687.8" dur="5.64">really don&amp;#39;t understand they truly</text>
  <text start="690.319" dur="5.07">believe the propaganda they believe that</text>
  <text start="693.44" dur="3.72">President Trump is bad they believe that</text>
  <text start="695.389" dur="5.611">Planned Parenthood is good they believe</text>
  <text start="697.16" dur="6.539">that Obama and Hillary Clinton are the</text>
  <text start="701" dur="8.99">greatest saviors of humanity they truly</text>
  <text start="703.699" dur="10.801">believe this they truly believe in</text>
  <text start="709.99" dur="7.81">socialism and how it really will help</text>
  <text start="714.5" dur="9.54">uplift humanity into some sort of utopia</text>
  <text start="717.8" dur="11.49">they believe it they don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="724.04" dur="7.71">they cannot see the matrix I can</text>
  <text start="729.29" dur="5.159">understand this because I was once one</text>
  <text start="731.75" dur="5.879">of those people I&amp;#39;m not anymore thank</text>
  <text start="734.449" dur="6.57">God but I was there and you have to be</text>
  <text start="737.629" dur="6.601">willing to step outside of your comfort</text>
  <text start="741.019" dur="5.731">zone and learn about things to the</text>
  <text start="744.23" dur="8.82">extent that it may really disrupt your</text>
  <text start="746.75" dur="10.41">whole paradigm what you perceive to be</text>
  <text start="753.05" dur="9.57">reality may not be true and some people</text>
  <text start="757.16" dur="7.979">are not willing to accept that no when</text>
  <text start="762.62" dur="4.68">it comes to Planned Parenthood their</text>
  <text start="765.139" dur="3.781">agenda is quite clear especially to</text>
  <text start="767.3" dur="4.649">those of us who understand and that is</text>
  <text start="768.92" dur="5.969">why they have to go now interestingly</text>
  <text start="771.949" dur="5.431">there is an upcoming Democrat to be on</text>
  <text start="774.889" dur="4.231">Tuesday of course now of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="777.38" dur="5.25">saying there&amp;#39;s going to be 12 instead of</text>
  <text start="779.12" dur="6.51">10 because Tulsi Gabbard did barely just</text>
  <text start="782.63" dur="5.55">qualify although she is threatened to</text>
  <text start="785.63" dur="4.649">boycott the debate but the biggest thing</text>
  <text start="788.18" dur="4.5">I want to talk about here that I really</text>
  <text start="790.279" dur="6.841">want you to note is that Elizabeth</text>
  <text start="792.68" dur="7.11">Warren here she is now currently in the</text>
  <text start="797.12" dur="5.279">news a lot they&amp;#39;re talking about her a</text>
  <text start="799.79" dur="4.859">lot now she is not the front-runner Joe</text>
  <text start="802.399" dur="4.151">Biden currently is or Lisa treu they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="804.649" dur="4.361">saying the polls are saying</text>
  <text start="806.55" dur="4.56">of course I don&amp;#39;t really know if I</text>
  <text start="809.01" dur="4.83">should really pay attention to these</text>
  <text start="811.11" dur="4.32">polls as being legitimate because these</text>
  <text start="813.84" dur="4.85">are the same polls that of course said</text>
  <text start="815.43" dur="6.75">that Hillary Clinton would win by a</text>
  <text start="818.69" dur="4.87">significant landslide 99% chances she</text>
  <text start="822.18" dur="3.36">would win and of course it was shown</text>
  <text start="823.56" dur="4.58">that she did not win because she is</text>
  <text start="825.54" dur="6.45">obviously not sitting in the White House</text>
  <text start="828.14" dur="7.27">but nonetheless Elizabeth Warren is</text>
  <text start="831.99" dur="7.8">trailing behind Joe Biden by one percent</text>
  <text start="835.41" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;re focusing on her and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="839.79" dur="6.09">think it&amp;#39;s just because Joe Biden is</text>
  <text start="842.22" dur="6.66">entangled in a corruption scandal right</text>
  <text start="845.88" dur="4.91">now I really think it has to do with her</text>
  <text start="848.88" dur="6.69">affiliation with Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="850.79" dur="7.81">so Elizabeth Warren here in Florida her</text>
  <text start="855.57" dur="6.48">campaign manager the new campaign</text>
  <text start="858.6" dur="7.56">manager for Florida is a former policy</text>
  <text start="862.05" dur="6.92">director for Planned Parenthood so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="866.16" dur="6.66">no surprise that all of a sudden she is</text>
  <text start="868.97" dur="5.37">really looked at as the shining star in</text>
  <text start="872.82" dur="4.92">the Democrat Party</text>
  <text start="874.34" dur="5.88">likewise Kamala Harris a while ago not</text>
  <text start="877.74" dur="5.01">that long ago was also a front-runner</text>
  <text start="880.22" dur="6.52">now of course she&amp;#39;s trailing and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="882.75" dur="6.83">even trailing in her own states but not</text>
  <text start="886.74" dur="6.54">that long ago she was looked at as a</text>
  <text start="889.58" dur="6.1">very possible frontrunner to take on</text>
  <text start="893.28" dur="5.31">president Trump she&amp;#39;s also affiliated</text>
  <text start="895.68" dur="6.33">with Planned Parenthood in fact she had</text>
  <text start="898.59" dur="5.49">received $15,000 or more from Planned</text>
  <text start="902.01" dur="4.41">Parenthood for her Senate campaign and</text>
  <text start="904.08" dur="4.14">this of course was right after she had</text>
  <text start="906.42" dur="5.31">ordered a raid on David daleiden</text>
  <text start="908.22" dur="6.99">apartment to gather up all of his</text>
  <text start="911.73" dur="6.48">equipment and videos at the request of</text>
  <text start="915.21" dur="6.21">Planned Parenthood as evidenced by email</text>
  <text start="918.21" dur="5.46">exchanges now held by the defense</text>
  <text start="921.42" dur="7.29">attorney for David daleiden in Sandra</text>
  <text start="923.67" dur="9.45">Merritt I think that Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="928.71" dur="7.75">at this point has perhaps tried to</text>
  <text start="933.12" dur="8.529">distance itself from Kamala Harris</text>
  <text start="936.46" dur="10.26">because of the fact that there is</text>
  <text start="941.649" dur="9.121">evidence that there is a link so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="946.72" dur="7.32">likely as a part of our strategy to pull</text>
  <text start="950.77" dur="5.28">away from Kamala Harris to really water</text>
  <text start="954.04" dur="5.01">down that link and then attach</text>
  <text start="956.05" dur="8.039">themselves under the radar so to speak</text>
  <text start="959.05" dur="8.49">to Elizabeth Warren there was only a</text>
  <text start="964.089" dur="5.461">very brief mention in the news that</text>
  <text start="967.54" dur="4.739">Elizabeth Warren had hired this new</text>
  <text start="969.55" dur="5.22">campaign campaign manager who was a</text>
  <text start="972.279" dur="4.551">policy director formerly for Planned</text>
  <text start="974.77" dur="2.06">Parenthood</text>
  <text start="976.86" dur="3.669">so this is a strategy of their so we</text>
  <text start="979.45" dur="3.72">think we should watch this very</text>
  <text start="980.529" dur="6.271">carefully now also when we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="983.17" dur="5.91">about this debate they&amp;#39;re looking at Joe</text>
  <text start="986.8" dur="4.349">Biden and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth</text>
  <text start="989.08" dur="4.23">Warren mainly now for Bernie Sanders</text>
  <text start="991.149" dur="4.88">they said that as a part of his strategy</text>
  <text start="993.31" dur="5.279">he really needs to come out very</text>
  <text start="996.029" dur="4.93">powerfully that he needs to present</text>
  <text start="998.589" dur="3.721">himself in a way that makes it look like</text>
  <text start="1000.959" dur="4.051">he&amp;#39;s still got it</text>
  <text start="1002.31" dur="4.62">that he hasn&amp;#39;t missed a beat so to speak</text>
  <text start="1005.01" dur="4.019">now of course this is in reference to</text>
  <text start="1006.93" dur="3.06">the fact that he just had a heart attack</text>
  <text start="1009.029" dur="3.571">not that long ago</text>
  <text start="1009.99" dur="3.78">now here&amp;#39;s the thing a while back there</text>
  <text start="1012.6" dur="3.33">were people who were criticizing</text>
  <text start="1013.77" dur="4.02">President Trump demanding his health</text>
  <text start="1015.93" dur="3.84">record saying that he was too old saying</text>
  <text start="1017.79" dur="3.84">that he wasn&amp;#39;t well saying that he</text>
  <text start="1019.77" dur="5.25">needed be removed from office because he</text>
  <text start="1021.63" dur="7.799">couldn&amp;#39;t handle it and yet here we have</text>
  <text start="1025.02" dur="7.2">Bernie Sanders an older guy who really</text>
  <text start="1029.429" dur="5.16">just had a heart attack everyone knows</text>
  <text start="1032.22" dur="5.099">about it and yet they&amp;#39;re saying oh well</text>
  <text start="1034.589" dur="4.921">he can just show up to this debate and</text>
  <text start="1037.319" dur="7.101">prove himself and then he hit back in</text>
  <text start="1039.51" dur="7.23">the game no this is a double standard</text>
  <text start="1044.42" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with President</text>
  <text start="1046.74" dur="3.14">Trump he didn&amp;#39;t just have a heart attack</text>
  <text start="1050.54" dur="6.24">but see this only applies to Donald</text>
  <text start="1053.94" dur="6.42">Trump this doesn&amp;#39;t apply to their side</text>
  <text start="1056.78" dur="5.56">the same thing with Joe Biden they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1060.36" dur="5.069">saying for his strategy he needs to come</text>
  <text start="1062.34" dur="5.13">out and show that he can really battle</text>
  <text start="1065.429" dur="4.111">against Donald Trump but he has what it</text>
  <text start="1067.47" dur="4.05">takes and stand up for his fan</text>
  <text start="1069.54" dur="4.8">which of course is in the middle of a</text>
  <text start="1071.52" dur="5.73">corruption scandal they&amp;#39;re the ones at</text>
  <text start="1074.34" dur="5.91">the center of this Ukrainian impeachment</text>
  <text start="1077.25" dur="4.86">inquiry of course they&amp;#39;re not the ones</text>
  <text start="1080.25" dur="6.26">who are being looked at as being guilty</text>
  <text start="1082.11" dur="7.86">but they are entangled it they should be</text>
  <text start="1086.51" dur="6.37">investigated but the Democrats are not</text>
  <text start="1089.97" dur="4.35">talking about that they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="1092.88" dur="4.32">he needs to come out and double down</text>
  <text start="1094.32" dur="7.16">instead stick up for himself and his</text>
  <text start="1097.2" dur="9.57">family even though they&amp;#39;re obviously</text>
  <text start="1101.48" dur="8.11">corrupt and this whole Ukraine scandal</text>
  <text start="1106.77" dur="10.29">should showcase that but again these</text>
  <text start="1109.59" dur="14.67">people really cannot see reality okay in</text>
  <text start="1117.06" dur="12.6">other news the Kurds have now aligned</text>
  <text start="1124.26" dur="6.9">themselves with Syrian forces and of</text>
  <text start="1129.66" dur="7.08">course Syrian forces are backed by</text>
  <text start="1131.16" dur="8.73">Russia and Iran now I&amp;#39;m not super</text>
  <text start="1136.74" dur="5.31">proponents of Bashar al-assad or Putin</text>
  <text start="1139.89" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re not perfect individuals they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1142.05" dur="5.99">not perfect leaders but they are the</text>
  <text start="1144.57" dur="9.86">leaders of their countries respectively</text>
  <text start="1148.04" dur="11.2">the Kurds live in Syria they are</text>
  <text start="1154.43" dur="7.9">technically Syrians so if they are now</text>
  <text start="1159.24" dur="7.5">making an alliance they are forging an</text>
  <text start="1162.33" dur="5.16">alliance with their presidents then so</text>
  <text start="1166.74" dur="5.99">be it</text>
  <text start="1167.49" dur="11.46">I think that&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="1172.73" dur="7.9">for them that way they can work together</text>
  <text start="1178.95" dur="4.68">and fight their own battles they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1180.63" dur="7.26">need us so yeah they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="1183.63" dur="7.23">instead of the US forces backing the</text>
  <text start="1187.89" dur="7.32">Kurds now the SDF is going to back the</text>
  <text start="1190.86" dur="7.23">Kurds that&amp;#39;s their own people okay great</text>
  <text start="1195.21" dur="5.54">let them band together unite and fight</text>
  <text start="1198.09" dur="2.66">their own battle</text>
  <text start="1201.15" dur="7.45">and let us stay out of it okay in other</text>
  <text start="1207.79" dur="5.22">news</text>
  <text start="1208.6" dur="7.35">so CNN had a town hall and so a town</text>
  <text start="1213.01" dur="6.6">hall is really supposed to be able to</text>
  <text start="1215.95" dur="6.9">differentiate candidates by setting them</text>
  <text start="1219.61" dur="6.3">apart according to very pronounced</text>
  <text start="1222.85" dur="4.35">differences but apparently that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1225.91" dur="4.37">what was accomplished here at this</text>
  <text start="1227.2" dur="6.06">quote-unquote Town Hall so of course</text>
  <text start="1230.28" dur="6.31">really all of the candidates just</text>
  <text start="1233.26" dur="6.63">parroted the same thing they all agreed</text>
  <text start="1236.59" dur="8.69">on the same fronts and it really just</text>
  <text start="1239.89" dur="11.09">centered on LGBTQ agendas about</text>
  <text start="1245.28" dur="9.73">transgender rights they didn&amp;#39;t focus on</text>
  <text start="1250.98" dur="7.45">anything that really challenged the</text>
  <text start="1255.01" dur="5.04">candidates whatsoever all they were</text>
  <text start="1258.43" dur="3.96">doing was pushing the narrative that</text>
  <text start="1260.05" dur="8.34">they want to push which is exactly what</text>
  <text start="1262.39" dur="9.48">CNN does all the time the most trusted</text>
  <text start="1268.39" dur="6.69">name in news is not real news it is</text>
  <text start="1271.87" dur="6.48">about pushing a narrative shaping the</text>
  <text start="1275.08" dur="5.58">public opinion shaping the public&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1278.35" dur="4.65">perception on reality because of course</text>
  <text start="1280.66" dur="9.78">when we think of the news the news is</text>
  <text start="1283" dur="11.46">supposed to give us reality the facts so</text>
  <text start="1290.44" dur="9.75">the public trusts them to tell them</text>
  <text start="1294.46" dur="8.69">what&amp;#39;s really going on and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1300.19" dur="5.43">a propaganda machine since the 1950s</text>
  <text start="1303.15" dur="7.3">operation Mockingbird where the CIA</text>
  <text start="1305.62" dur="7.07">infiltrated news outlets broadcasters so</text>
  <text start="1310.45" dur="5.25">that they could disseminate information</text>
  <text start="1312.69" dur="9.34">not real information but the information</text>
  <text start="1315.7" dur="9.5">that they want you to think they want to</text>
  <text start="1322.03" dur="3.17">tell you what to think</text>
  <text start="1326.9" dur="4.14">and of course news outlets aren&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="1329.33" dur="3.69">only ones involved in this and I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="1331.04" dur="4.61">this before but Hollywood also shares</text>
  <text start="1333.02" dur="5.03">that responsibility they are part of</text>
  <text start="1335.65" dur="11.32">pushing the narrative through culture</text>
  <text start="1338.05" dur="12.55">which is also very important now CNN</text>
  <text start="1346.97" dur="7.58">should be quite worried today because</text>
  <text start="1350.6" dur="7.98">apparently it has been announced that</text>
  <text start="1354.55" dur="4.8">there was an insider who became a</text>
  <text start="1358.58" dur="5.13">whistleblower</text>
  <text start="1359.35" dur="6.49">after meeting James O&amp;#39;Keefe from Project</text>
  <text start="1363.71" dur="5.13">Veritas and of course Project Veritas</text>
  <text start="1365.84" dur="7.11">has become very infamous by now they</text>
  <text start="1368.84" dur="7.11">have been sending in their journalists</text>
  <text start="1372.95" dur="9.24">undercover to expose politicians for a</text>
  <text start="1375.95" dur="10.05">while now and now they have an insider</text>
  <text start="1382.19" dur="10.29">or they&amp;#39;ve had an insider in the CNN for</text>
  <text start="1386" dur="12.27">a while recording everything and they</text>
  <text start="1392.48" dur="10.01">are set to expose that today at noon so</text>
  <text start="1398.27" dur="9.38">this should get very interesting and</text>
  <text start="1402.49" dur="5.16">when they do release these videos</text>
  <text start="1408.13" dur="6.49">exposing CNN we need to spread these</text>
  <text start="1411.95" dur="6.3">videos far and wide plaster them</text>
  <text start="1414.62" dur="6.3">wherever anyone you know who is trapped</text>
  <text start="1418.25" dur="4.43">in this matrix plaster them where they</text>
  <text start="1420.92" dur="4.92">can see it</text>
  <text start="1422.68" dur="5.92">make them see it of course we can&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="1425.84" dur="5.22">them see it because some people will see</text>
  <text start="1428.6" dur="7.65">it and they&amp;#39;ll still not believe it but</text>
  <text start="1431.06" dur="13.14">a lot of people will this could break</text>
  <text start="1436.25" dur="14.42">the CNN for good so this is a little</text>
  <text start="1444.2" dur="6.47">preview of what&amp;#39;s to come</text>
  <text start="1451.2" dur="8.91">I decided we&amp;#39;re in camera and recorded</text>
  <text start="1457.53" dur="3.96">basically anyone on that hood I&amp;#39;d say</text>
  <text start="1460.11" dur="4.55">expose the bodice to us all running</text>
  <text start="1461.49" dur="3.17">rampant throughout the puffy</text>
  <text start="1482.049" dur="4.901">so this should get interesting and I</text>
  <text start="1485.33" dur="3.99">really think that they should do the</text>
  <text start="1486.95" dur="4.17">same thing with other news outlets as</text>
  <text start="1489.32" dur="6.09">well because this is not just limited to</text>
  <text start="1491.12" dur="7.439">CNN not by a long shot so I&amp;#39;m sure this</text>
  <text start="1495.41" dur="4.98">is not the end of the exposure of the</text>
  <text start="1498.559" dur="5.041">mainstream media I&amp;#39;m sure they will</text>
  <text start="1500.39" dur="6.57">infiltrate others and I think this is a</text>
  <text start="1503.6" dur="10.35">good thing this is a good thing we need</text>
  <text start="1506.96" dur="10.53">to break the MSM okay now finally I want</text>
  <text start="1513.95" dur="9.27">to talk about the protests in Ecuador</text>
  <text start="1517.49" dur="7.2">and they got intense so in this video</text>
  <text start="1523.22" dur="4.35">there was a couple of tweets that I</text>
  <text start="1524.69" dur="6.979">found this one here shows you how</text>
  <text start="1527.57" dur="4.099">massive it is look at all these people</text>
  <text start="1531.73" dur="8.14">huge this is really comparable to the</text>
  <text start="1535.79" dur="8.4">Hong Kong protests to be honest now this</text>
  <text start="1539.87" dur="6.84">one I found and so I translated this it</text>
  <text start="1544.19" dur="5.31">says strong images indigenous movement</text>
  <text start="1546.71" dur="5.55">coming to Quito Ecuador the message to</text>
  <text start="1549.5" dur="5.46">linin Moreno the president is either</text>
  <text start="1552.26" dur="4.35">repeal the IMF measures or quit the</text>
  <text start="1554.96" dur="3.78">people took the capital and a true</text>
  <text start="1556.61" dur="4.5">rebellion against neoliberal measures</text>
  <text start="1558.74" dur="8.16">all support for the Ecuadorian struggle</text>
  <text start="1561.11" dur="10.41">and so shows here where they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="1566.9" dur="8.07">against the police force they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="1571.52" dur="8.01">them back I mean that that is a huge</text>
  <text start="1574.97" dur="7.05">amount of people and then of course I</text>
  <text start="1579.53" dur="4.17">found the update later on down here</text>
  <text start="1582.02" dur="3.12">where he said that they have reached an</text>
  <text start="1583.7" dur="3.69">agreement I&amp;#39;ll talk about that in just a</text>
  <text start="1585.14" dur="4.02">second but this is actually the first</text>
  <text start="1587.39" dur="5.27">time that I&amp;#39;ve ever really heard the</text>
  <text start="1589.16" dur="5.79">term neoliberal so we&amp;#39;ve heard of neocon</text>
  <text start="1592.66" dur="5.71">neoconservative but I haven&amp;#39;t heard of</text>
  <text start="1594.95" dur="7.09">neoliberal before now as soon as I saw</text>
  <text start="1598.37" dur="7.69">neoliberal and I am</text>
  <text start="1602.04" dur="6.78">I really thought that this must have</text>
  <text start="1606.06" dur="6.15">something to do with globalism the</text>
  <text start="1608.82" dur="4.71">globalist push so similar to the yellow</text>
  <text start="1612.21" dur="6.69">vests protest so the yellow vests</text>
  <text start="1613.53" dur="7.2">protest was not just about a gas tax it</text>
  <text start="1618.9" dur="4.53">was not about that even though that was</text>
  <text start="1620.73" dur="4.65">a component of their grievances that was</text>
  <text start="1623.43" dur="5.52">not the entire thing and in fact it</text>
  <text start="1625.38" dur="7.2">really boiled down to the push of the</text>
  <text start="1628.95" dur="6.63">globalist policies that really was over</text>
  <text start="1632.58" dur="5.19">running the people there that is what</text>
  <text start="1635.58" dur="4.67">they were angry about and of course that</text>
  <text start="1637.77" dur="4.98">is why you saw yellow vests protests</text>
  <text start="1640.25" dur="6.85">popping up in other places not just in</text>
  <text start="1642.75" dur="9.03">France but also in Canada and lots of</text>
  <text start="1647.1" dur="6.81">other places Ireland and in Canada</text>
  <text start="1651.78" dur="3.36">specifically I remember seeing a video</text>
  <text start="1653.91" dur="3.17">and this is actually where I found out</text>
  <text start="1655.14" dur="6.44">about the global pact for migration</text>
  <text start="1657.08" dur="8.74">ratified by the United Nations where</text>
  <text start="1661.58" dur="6.52">most nations had signed on to this of</text>
  <text start="1665.82" dur="4.02">course I president did not but most</text>
  <text start="1668.1" dur="3.84">nations signed on to this global pact</text>
  <text start="1669.84" dur="6.18">for migration behind the backs of its</text>
  <text start="1671.94" dur="6.45">people stating that migration was a</text>
  <text start="1676.02" dur="6.81">human right and that immigration should</text>
  <text start="1678.39" dur="8">be not regulated whatsoever more or less</text>
  <text start="1682.83" dur="6.03">eliminating the needs for borders and</text>
  <text start="1686.39" dur="5.94">the Canadians were talking about this</text>
  <text start="1688.86" dur="6.09">during their own yellow vests protests</text>
  <text start="1692.33" dur="7">so it was not about a gas tax it was</text>
  <text start="1694.95" dur="6.15">about globalism similarly that is</text>
  <text start="1699.33" dur="7.08">exactly what was happening here in</text>
  <text start="1701.1" dur="6.9">Ecuador so when it came to the IMF what</text>
  <text start="1706.41" dur="6.84">had happened before was that their</text>
  <text start="1708" dur="10.65">former President had very socialist</text>
  <text start="1713.25" dur="12.33">policies and was overspending driving</text>
  <text start="1718.65" dur="9.24">its economy down the drains it was</text>
  <text start="1725.58" dur="5.18">destroying their economy because of how</text>
  <text start="1727.89" dur="6.18">much money they were spending so then</text>
  <text start="1730.76" dur="4.71">the new president who came in Lenin</text>
  <text start="1734.07" dur="7.16">Moreno</text>
  <text start="1735.47" dur="9.43">although he had initially come in really</text>
  <text start="1741.23" dur="4.87">touting those same policies and got the</text>
  <text start="1744.9" dur="3.96">green light from the previous</text>
  <text start="1746.1" dur="5.52">administration months after that he</text>
  <text start="1748.86" dur="8.97">decided to revert to more populist</text>
  <text start="1751.62" dur="13.26">policies however it was too little too</text>
  <text start="1757.83" dur="9.9">late because imagine that the previous</text>
  <text start="1764.88" dur="5.07">administration had been engaged in</text>
  <text start="1767.73" dur="8">overspending and socialist policies for</text>
  <text start="1769.95" dur="7.8">so long and put them in a hole so then</text>
  <text start="1775.73" dur="4.6">the administration the new</text>
  <text start="1777.75" dur="6.09">administration was forced or at least</text>
  <text start="1780.33" dur="8.25">they thought they were forced to turn to</text>
  <text start="1783.84" dur="6.21">the IMF the IMF is an international</text>
  <text start="1788.58" dur="8.46">lending company but I&amp;#39;m going to talk</text>
  <text start="1790.05" dur="10.14">about them in just a minute so they went</text>
  <text start="1797.04" dur="7.44">to the IMF and they requested assistance</text>
  <text start="1800.19" dur="9.06">and so the IMF decided to give them 4.2</text>
  <text start="1804.48" dur="7.52">billion dollars except there were</text>
  <text start="1809.25" dur="7.08">stipulations to this there was a catch</text>
  <text start="1812" dur="7.66">so in exchange for the 4.2 billion</text>
  <text start="1816.33" dur="9.21">dollars in assistance they had to abide</text>
  <text start="1819.66" dur="12.24">by IMF recommendations as part of an</text>
  <text start="1825.54" dur="8.79">austerity package while a gas tax the</text>
  <text start="1831.9" dur="6.02">hike in those gas prices was a part of</text>
  <text start="1834.33" dur="3.59">that there was only a small part of that</text>
  <text start="1837.95" dur="5.83">other recommendations included and of</text>
  <text start="1842.22" dur="5.04">course these are not recommendations</text>
  <text start="1843.78" dur="6.47">these are actually requirements as a</text>
  <text start="1847.26" dur="9.36">part of this 4.2 billion dollar package</text>
  <text start="1850.25" dur="10.81">they agreed to hike taxes overall they</text>
  <text start="1856.62" dur="6.03">also agreed that the wages of public</text>
  <text start="1861.06" dur="5.55">workers new public workers would be</text>
  <text start="1862.65" dur="6.36">reduced by 20 percent 20 percent that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1866.61" dur="5.059">a lot in addition to that</text>
  <text start="1869.01" dur="5.63">labor regulations would be rolled back</text>
  <text start="1871.669" dur="8.5">huge human rights violation there in</text>
  <text start="1874.64" dur="10.18">addition to that every single Ecuadorian</text>
  <text start="1880.169" dur="7.351">citizen would be required to donate one</text>
  <text start="1884.82" dur="8.19">day&amp;#39;s worth of pay to the government</text>
  <text start="1887.52" dur="8.67">each month in addition to that vacation</text>
  <text start="1893.01" dur="6.659">days would be reduced from 30 days a</text>
  <text start="1896.19" dur="5.609">year to 15 days a year and these are</text>
  <text start="1899.669" dur="4.38">only just a few of the recommendations</text>
  <text start="1901.799" dur="7.651">or requirements as part of this</text>
  <text start="1904.049" dur="7.591">austerity package now a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1909.45" dur="8.91">articles that I&amp;#39;ve seen even Breitbart</text>
  <text start="1911.64" dur="9.93">so Breitbart was even saying that the</text>
  <text start="1918.36" dur="5.67">Vice President was saying that</text>
  <text start="1921.57" dur="6.21">foreigners were being paid to</text>
  <text start="1924.03" dur="9.269">participate in this protest now I really</text>
  <text start="1927.78" dur="9.12">don&amp;#39;t trust the vice-president because</text>
  <text start="1933.299" dur="9.151">he had the endorsement of the previous</text>
  <text start="1936.9" dur="7.89">administration now Breitbart is saying</text>
  <text start="1942.45" dur="4.14">that the vice president has said that</text>
  <text start="1944.79" dur="3.87">they have evidence that there were</text>
  <text start="1946.59" dur="4.2">foreigners that were paid forty to fifty</text>
  <text start="1948.66" dur="7.71">dollars to participate in riots against</text>
  <text start="1950.79" dur="10.35">the current president now they have</text>
  <text start="1956.37" dur="9.14">rounded up foreigners however a lot of</text>
  <text start="1961.14" dur="7.65">those people are actually migrated from</text>
  <text start="1965.51" dur="7.98">Venezuela because of Venezuela is also</text>
  <text start="1968.79" dur="7.17">experiencing a lot of chaos</text>
  <text start="1973.49" dur="4.27">uber policies that have been in place</text>
  <text start="1975.96" dur="5.79">there for years because it&amp;#39;s a socialist</text>
  <text start="1977.76" dur="7.47">country this is what socialism does it</text>
  <text start="1981.75" dur="6.419">destroys societies so there were</text>
  <text start="1985.23" dur="4.92">foreigners mostly from Venezuela who</text>
  <text start="1988.169" dur="4.14">were there and that of course they were</text>
  <text start="1990.15" dur="4.47">rounded up as part of these protests as</text>
  <text start="1992.309" dur="3.421">well but does that mean that this was</text>
  <text start="1994.62" dur="3.87">some</text>
  <text start="1995.73" dur="5.46">leftist group conspiracy no now here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1998.49" dur="7.86">the thing is I think this is very clever</text>
  <text start="2001.19" dur="9.54">propaganda because they have this</text>
  <text start="2006.35" dur="9.57">country so divided that in order to</text>
  <text start="2010.73" dur="7.23">clickbait liberals they will title</text>
  <text start="2015.92" dur="6.75">things and make stories up to where it</text>
  <text start="2017.96" dur="6.95">makes conservatives look bad right the</text>
  <text start="2022.67" dur="4.83">right wing is the white nationalists</text>
  <text start="2024.91" dur="7.63">well they do the same thing for</text>
  <text start="2027.5" dur="11.33">conservatives they change up stories to</text>
  <text start="2032.54" dur="10.29">make it believable by labeling it as the</text>
  <text start="2038.83" dur="7.24">mastermind action of a liberal leftist</text>
  <text start="2042.83" dur="6.33">group oh the leftist groups are behind</text>
  <text start="2046.07" dur="6.9">this it&amp;#39;s evil so then we don&amp;#39;t look at</text>
  <text start="2049.16" dur="6.15">the real story that is why they want us</text>
  <text start="2052.97" dur="5.46">divide it so much because we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2055.31" dur="5.04">looking at the real story even Breitbart</text>
  <text start="2058.43" dur="5.28">and I consistently look at Breitbart</text>
  <text start="2060.35" dur="8.49">Breitbart here is spitting out a story</text>
  <text start="2063.71" dur="7.41">that is largely untrue when you look at</text>
  <text start="2068.84" dur="3.78">the real cause of this but nobody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2071.12" dur="3.15">gonna look at the real cause of this</text>
  <text start="2072.62" dur="3.03">because all the news agencies are</text>
  <text start="2074.27" dur="5.04">telling you what to think about this</text>
  <text start="2075.65" dur="5.85">story I&amp;#39;m telling you I&amp;#39;ve looked at a</text>
  <text start="2079.31" dur="7.94">lot of this and I&amp;#39;ve even looked at the</text>
  <text start="2081.5" dur="8.42">IMF leftist groups aren&amp;#39;t propelling</text>
  <text start="2087.25" dur="5.85">this riot</text>
  <text start="2089.92" dur="9.4">they weren&amp;#39;t raha it wasn&amp;#39;t a conspiracy</text>
  <text start="2093.1" dur="8.38">to overthrow the new president it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2099.32" dur="5.31">just because of a gas tax none of these</text>
  <text start="2101.48" dur="6.15">narratives are true it&amp;#39;s not the real</text>
  <text start="2104.63" dur="11.24">story if you want to get to the real</text>
  <text start="2107.63" dur="8.24">meat of it you look at the IMF because</text>
  <text start="2115.9" dur="4.27">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="2118.1" dur="8.04">these protesters they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="2120.17" dur="8.1">the IMF okay so what really is the IMF</text>
  <text start="2126.14" dur="2.93">and its goals so the IMF like I said</text>
  <text start="2128.27" dur="6.8">before is an</text>
  <text start="2129.07" dur="9.33">International Monetary Fund and then</text>
  <text start="2135.07" dur="5.01">when I was looking around at what IMF</text>
  <text start="2138.4" dur="3.39">was they had mentioned sustainable</text>
  <text start="2140.08" dur="3.03">development goals and anytime I see</text>
  <text start="2141.79" dur="2.91">sustainable development goals I</text>
  <text start="2143.11" dur="4.82">immediately thinking the United Nations</text>
  <text start="2144.7" dur="5.37">however maybe they just call it that</text>
  <text start="2147.93" dur="5.26">maybe they have sustainable development</text>
  <text start="2150.07" dur="3.72">goals of their own but then I dug around</text>
  <text start="2153.19" dur="5.13">some more</text>
  <text start="2153.79" dur="8.1">and my gut instinct was right they are</text>
  <text start="2158.32" dur="6.03">related to the United Nations so this</text>
  <text start="2161.89" dur="3.9">here says the sustainable development</text>
  <text start="2164.35" dur="3.78">goals are a set of global development</text>
  <text start="2165.79" dur="4.47">targets adopted by the member countries</text>
  <text start="2168.13" dur="4.14">of the United Nations in September 2015</text>
  <text start="2170.26" dur="5.42">this is when they talked about agenda</text>
  <text start="2172.27" dur="6.93">2030 and they focused a lot on</text>
  <text start="2175.68" dur="7.39">redistribution of wealth and climate</text>
  <text start="2179.2" dur="7.8">change course right now we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="2183.07" dur="5.64">huge uptick in climate hysteria this is</text>
  <text start="2187" dur="3.75">their agenda being rolled out and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2188.71" dur="4.98">not paying attention no one&amp;#39;s paying</text>
  <text start="2190.75" dur="4.77">attention global pact for migration</text>
  <text start="2193.69" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s why there were uh there was</text>
  <text start="2195.52" dur="4.26">unrest in France with the yellow vest</text>
  <text start="2197.44" dur="5.49">protesters not just in France but also</text>
  <text start="2199.78" dur="5.7">in Canada and other places they were</text>
  <text start="2202.93" dur="5.61">protesting these globalist policies but</text>
  <text start="2205.48" dur="5.64">they don&amp;#39;t want you to see that they</text>
  <text start="2208.54" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t want you to know about that they</text>
  <text start="2211.12" dur="4.1">only want you to think that oh it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2213.04" dur="5.49">a gas they&amp;#39;re mad about gas prices</text>
  <text start="2215.22" dur="7.98">that&amp;#39;s not it that is not it</text>
  <text start="2218.53" dur="7.17">so when it comes to the IMF they have</text>
  <text start="2223.2" dur="4.72">sustainable development goals that are</text>
  <text start="2225.7" dur="4.92">linked to the United Nations the United</text>
  <text start="2227.92" dur="11.49">Nations is at the head of all of this</text>
  <text start="2230.62" dur="10.65">and as part of this they have to they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2239.41" dur="4.14">part of the financial side of things</text>
  <text start="2241.27" dur="4.05">right and so they&amp;#39;re gonna go around to</text>
  <text start="2243.55" dur="5.58">different countries who sign on with</text>
  <text start="2245.32" dur="10.23">them and teach them about how to run</text>
  <text start="2249.13" dur="8.16">their economy so one thing I want to</text>
  <text start="2255.55" dur="3.75">highlight here I want to show you really</text>
  <text start="2257.29" dur="3.54">quick is the platform for collaboration</text>
  <text start="2259.3" dur="3.72">on tax</text>
  <text start="2260.83" dur="4.5">so of course it says the IMF provides</text>
  <text start="2263.02" dur="3.84">technical assistance on tax policy and</text>
  <text start="2265.33" dur="3.99">administration to over a hundred</text>
  <text start="2266.86" dur="4.65">countries every year and is scaling up</text>
  <text start="2269.32" dur="6.57">its support so let&amp;#39;s take a look at this</text>
  <text start="2271.51" dur="6.84">it is a joint effort launched in April</text>
  <text start="2275.89" dur="3.87">2016 by the International Monetary Fund</text>
  <text start="2278.35" dur="4.14">the Organisation for Economic</text>
  <text start="2279.76" dur="6.62">Cooperation and Development the United</text>
  <text start="2282.49" dur="6.66">Nations and the World Bank Group Wow</text>
  <text start="2286.38" dur="4.93">these are all the usual suspects for the</text>
  <text start="2289.15" dur="5.19">new world order which is something I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2291.31" dur="9.47">talked about before this is not some</text>
  <text start="2294.34" dur="11.49">made-up myths this is reality this is</text>
  <text start="2300.78" dur="12.97">something that is in the works in very</text>
  <text start="2305.83" dur="14.25">concrete ways so as a part of this they</text>
  <text start="2313.75" dur="8.13">say that when it comes to taxation the</text>
  <text start="2320.08" dur="3.6">four PCT members support and their</text>
  <text start="2321.88" dur="4.41">different capacities country efforts on</text>
  <text start="2323.68" dur="4.98">tax issues such as policy dialogue</text>

  <text start="2444.859" dur="8.61">comes to save the day the same</text>
  <text start="2448.809" dur="8.081">organizations that made the problem</text>
  <text start="2453.469" dur="5.55">occur in the first place the same ones</text>
  <text start="2456.89" dur="5.429">who created the problem are now coming</text>
  <text start="2459.019" dur="7.08">forward with a so-called solution why</text>
  <text start="2462.319" dur="10.02">because now they they have control that</text>
  <text start="2466.099" dur="8.97">is the goal as soon as they signed that</text>
  <text start="2472.339" dur="6.89">agreement with the IMF they signed away</text>
  <text start="2475.069" dur="8.27">their country and the people know it</text>
  <text start="2479.229" dur="7.451">that is why the people are uprising that</text>
  <text start="2483.339" dur="6.94">is why they were fighting not over a gas</text>
  <text start="2486.68" dur="8.519">tax not over a leftist agenda conspiracy</text>
  <text start="2490.279" dur="11.84">it was because they needed to make sure</text>
  <text start="2495.199" dur="6.92">that that agreement was dissolved</text>
  <text start="2503.079" dur="4.141">because it meant disaster for their</text>
  <text start="2505.88" dur="6.199">country</text>
  <text start="2507.22" dur="11.879">and for their sovereignty now the good</text>
  <text start="2512.079" dur="10.5">news is is that these people have now</text>
  <text start="2519.099" dur="6.99">been largely successful so as of late</text>
  <text start="2522.579" dur="6.661">last night around 10:00 p.m. the new</text>
  <text start="2526.089" dur="10.351">president has finally agreed to withdraw</text>
  <text start="2529.24" dur="10.32">from the IMF agreement they&amp;#39;ve agreed to</text>
  <text start="2536.44" dur="5.22">withdraw from the IMF agreement and come</text>
  <text start="2539.56" dur="6.18">to the table and come up with a solution</text>
  <text start="2541.66" dur="8.669">to tighten government spending now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2545.74" dur="9.21">hoping that this means that the</text>
  <text start="2550.329" dur="8.851">administration and the people will come</text>
  <text start="2554.95" dur="5.659">to the table together to come up with a</text>
  <text start="2559.18" dur="5.34">solution to tighten spending because</text>
  <text start="2560.609" dur="6.521">that is necessary because they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="2564.52" dur="5.01">that situation because of the</text>
  <text start="2567.13" dur="6.59">overspending practices of the previous</text>
  <text start="2569.53" dur="7.17">administration the socialist policies</text>
  <text start="2573.72" dur="5.44">that facilitated overspending so they do</text>
  <text start="2576.7" dur="4.11">need to tighten their belts but they</text>
  <text start="2579.16" dur="6.63">need to come into an agreement on how</text>
  <text start="2580.81" dur="7.559">that is going to work so this is good</text>
  <text start="2585.79" dur="6.09">news for now so I&amp;#39;ll be following this</text>
  <text start="2588.369" dur="4.831">story to see what happens with it but</text>
  <text start="2591.88" dur="5.219">I&amp;#39;m hoping that they can work it out</text>
  <text start="2593.2" dur="8.07">themselves and not resort to signing on</text>
  <text start="2597.099" dur="9.681">to the IMF they cannot sign on to the</text>
  <text start="2601.27" dur="8.76">IMF because the IMF is an associate of</text>
  <text start="2606.78" dur="9.549">the United Nations they&amp;#39;re all working</text>
  <text start="2610.03" dur="9.74">towards the same goal and as far as the</text>
  <text start="2616.329" dur="6.75">u.s. goes we need to distance ourselves</text>
  <text start="2619.77" dur="11.47">from the United Nations and from the IMF</text>
  <text start="2623.079" dur="14.631">as far as possible their agenda is not</text>
  <text start="2631.24" dur="6.47">the agenda of the people they do not</text>
  <text start="2637.83" dur="4.61">champion the idea of sovereign nations</text>
  <text start="2643.34" dur="9.82">they want control if you haven&amp;#39;t seen it</text>
  <text start="2650.67" dur="4.17">before I hope you can see it now I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2653.16" dur="3.99">been talking about this for a little</text>
