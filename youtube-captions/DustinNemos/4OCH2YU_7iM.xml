  <text start="539.62" dur="4.35">the border or they don&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s gonna get</text>
  <text start="541.27" dur="7.17">climactic I think it&amp;#39;s an opportunity</text>

  <text start="556.03" dur="3.81">working against them right now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="557.98" dur="5.94">why they had to change the narrative and</text>
  <text start="559.84" dur="5.97">go to the mega bomber and you know</text>
  <text start="563.92" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re not even concentrating so much</text>
  <text start="565.81" dur="4.62">on this shooter in in Pennsylvania</text>
  <text start="568.57" dur="4.95">because he was a Trump hater the</text>
  <text start="570.43" dur="7.05">concentrating on the mega bomber and you</text>
  <text start="573.52" dur="8.01">know that guy had 32 he followed 32</text>
  <text start="577.48" dur="6.15">people on Twitter and I have like 15,000</text>

  <text start="586.24" dur="4.02">supporters he didn&amp;#39;t follow a1 trends</text>
  <text start="588.7" dur="3.15">Trump supporters they were all liberals</text>
  <text start="590.26" dur="3.93">that he was following so they switched</text>
  <text start="591.85" dur="4.71">him from Democrat to Republican really</text>
  <text start="594.19" dur="4.89">quickly and he was you know he looks</text>

  <text start="624.01" dur="5.34">now people are getting distracted by</text>
  <text start="627.04" dur="5.64">other news cycles and stuff and he</text>
  <text start="629.35" dur="5.94">reminded people to go vote but you know</text>

  <text start="893.51" dur="4.41">on me but that happens to me</text>
  <text start="895.52" dur="4.02">occasionally it was back to the</text>
  <text start="897.92" dur="4.26">immigrant issue a little bit and in</text>
  <text start="899.54" dur="4.74">terms of the how to get rid of them you</text>
  <text start="902.18" dur="4.14">know how to be effectively about it and</text>
  <text start="904.28" dur="5.01">I was basically around the the welfare</text>
  <text start="906.32" dur="5.75">state that was the kind of the start of</text>
  <text start="909.29" dur="4.83">my thought you have made a comment</text>
  <text start="912.07" dur="4.3">basically the best thing to do would be</text>
  <text start="914.12" dur="4.2">instead of the wall which is it is</text>
  <text start="916.37" dur="6.36">problematic and expensive in some cases</text>
  <text start="918.32" dur="9.18">just cut the welfare state you know cut</text>
  <text start="922.73" dur="6.99">the reason that they come no soft I mean</text>
  <text start="927.5" dur="4.53">I think we should do the wall - I think</text>
  <text start="929.72" dur="4.92">it should be a double whammy but there</text>
  <text start="932.03" dur="3.48">are areas that there cap there&amp;#39;s no wall</text>
  <text start="934.64" dur="4.5">so you</text>
  <text start="935.51" dur="7.05">no I think we should do as China if you</text>
  <text start="939.14" dur="5.43">know we&amp;#39;re Chinese I mean I we work 24/7</text>
  <text start="942.56" dur="4.14">all the money in Asia is from the</text>
  <text start="944.57" dur="5.64">Chinese all those places like Indonesia</text>
  <text start="946.7" dur="5.4">where they have palm oil Malaysia would</text>
  <text start="950.21" dur="6.12">have the rubber plantations guess who</text>
  <text start="952.1" dur="6.6">owns all of it it&amp;#39;s the Chinese the 10%</text>
  <text start="956.33" dur="5.58">and they&amp;#39;re in Muslim countries so we</text>
  <text start="958.7" dur="6.54">are cut the cash and also build a wall</text>
  <text start="961.91" dur="6.72">so you know we work 24/7 or hard workers</text>
  <text start="965.24" dur="7.44">and we don&amp;#39;t want anyone to parasite and</text>
  <text start="968.63" dur="6.6">and get a free ride yeah go ahead go</text>
  <text start="972.68" dur="6.56">ahead you can&amp;#39;t call me racist because</text>
  <text start="975.23" dur="5.67">I&amp;#39;m an Asian and I&amp;#39;m a woman so yeah</text>
  <text start="979.24" dur="6.25">yeah that&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="980.9" dur="6.21">in the victim Olympics so you know it I</text>
  <text start="985.49" dur="2.85">use this as an example often because</text>
  <text start="987.11" dur="3.18">there are certain cultures that are just</text>
  <text start="988.34" dur="5.19">more prone to violence and crime and and</text>
  <text start="990.29" dur="5.94">just problems and we&amp;#39;ve seen many</text>

  <text start="1453.11" dur="3.51">facts not feelings which sometimes we</text>
  <text start="1455.179" dur="3.811">just have to deal with reality as it is</text>
  <text start="1456.62" dur="6.03">and you know when people get mad about</text>
  <text start="1458.99" dur="6.96">that I like to point out at one point in</text>
  <text start="1462.65" dur="5.19">in US history the black American</text>
  <text start="1465.95" dur="3.599">population was actually closing the IQ</text>

  <text start="1469.549" dur="3.801">smart</text>
  <text start="1470.08" dur="6.87">right so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a lot of this has to</text>
  <text start="1473.35" dur="5.64">do with having a stable fair kind of an</text>
  <text start="1476.95" dur="3.5">equal playing ground you know ideally</text>
  <text start="1478.99" dur="4.65">like a very limited government</text>
  <text start="1480.45" dur="4.99">constitutional republic the way we used</text>
  <text start="1483.64" dur="3.66">to have it where people had an</text>
  <text start="1485.44" dur="3.51">opportunity and stuff you give people</text>
  <text start="1487.3" dur="4.23">that and some stability and then over</text>

  <text start="1493.78" dur="5.34">healthier skills go up across the whole</text>
  <text start="1497.53" dur="6.12">population kind of the rising tide</text>
  <text start="1499.12" dur="5.91">raises all boats so you know some people</text>
  <text start="1503.65" dur="3.57">just call you a racist for pointed out</text>
  <text start="1505.03" dur="3.84">but there&amp;#39;s a lot to it you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1507.22" dur="5.16">a lot of information that goes into that</text>
  <text start="1508.87" dur="5.19">you situation because I&amp;#39;ve dealt with</text>
  <text start="1512.38" dur="5.4">that myself because I sometimes I talked</text>
  <text start="1514.06" dur="5.31">about the IQ issue but yeah so you know</text>
  <text start="1517.78" dur="5.94">you&amp;#39;ve helped us kind of understand</text>
  <text start="1519.37" dur="6.03">things from a you know a legal immigrant</text>

  <text start="1527.8" dur="4.56">as a term either I like to say cultural</text>
  <text start="1530.8" dur="4.29">invaders but sometimes that&amp;#39;s too much</text>
  <text start="1532.36" dur="5.25">for people you can call them illegals</text>
  <text start="1535.09" dur="3.09">for sure they&amp;#39;re illegal it&amp;#39;s against</text>
  <text start="1537.61" dur="2.66">the law</text>
  <text start="1538.18" dur="5.85">illegals means against the law and</text>
  <text start="1540.27" dur="5.71">that&amp;#39;s what it means it&amp;#39;s not a migrant</text>
  <text start="1544.03" dur="3.87">if you&amp;#39;re a migrant you&amp;#39;re not your</text>
  <text start="1545.98" dur="4.29">peaceful you don&amp;#39;t break down the fences</text>
