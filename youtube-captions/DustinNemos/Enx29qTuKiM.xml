  <text start="265.919" dur="4.25">cascaded into an avalanche</text>
  <text start="267.68" dur="5.07">I&amp;#39;m awakening and it was traumatic to</text>
  <text start="270.169" dur="4.441">experience but you know God sort of lets</text>
  <text start="272.75" dur="5.28">you discover these things in the quiet</text>
  <text start="274.61" dur="6.36">solitude of prison or at home or</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="5.22">wherever you are where the busyness of</text>
  <text start="280.97" dur="3.99">life is silenced and there&amp;#39;s no place</text>
  <text start="283.25" dur="4.669">better to silence the busyness of life</text>
  <text start="284.96" dur="5.31">then in in a prison environment so I</text>
  <text start="287.919" dur="4.241">describe that in the book and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="5.85">personal transformation and a revelation</text>
  <text start="292.16" dur="5.46">and Awakening and a fury that comes out</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="3.9">when you discover all of these things</text>
  <text start="297.62" dur="5.85">because it also makes me flashback to</text>
  <text start="300.02" dur="6.39">days of military service and the young</text>
  <text start="303.47" dur="4.83">kids I saw your age and younger who had</text>

  <text start="308.3" dur="5.22">beyond belief and were killed and turned</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="6.03">into vegetables and horrific horrors</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="7.32">that were done all out of a lie out of a</text>
  <text start="316.46" dur="6.84">false flag war - to artificially create</text>
  <text start="320.84" dur="5.1">this juggernaut of military full</text>
  <text start="323.3" dur="4.95">spectrum dominance of a neocon empire</text>
  <text start="325.94" dur="5.67">that they were trying to build in the</text>
  <text start="328.25" dur="5.159">late 1990s and use 9/11 trigger so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.61" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s a variety of things coming together</text>
  <text start="333.409" dur="4.951">and it scares the hell out of the deep</text>
  <text start="336.83" dur="3.3">state it scares the hell out of members</text>
  <text start="338.36" dur="4.17">of Congress I&amp;#39;ve met with members of</text>
  <text start="340.13" dur="4.23">Congress I&amp;#39;ve videotaped phone calls</text>

  <text start="344.36" dur="3.45">levels in the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="345.44" dur="3.9">including Michael Cohen his lawyer which</text>
  <text start="347.81" dur="5.639">is one of the reasons they&amp;#39;ve come after</text>
  <text start="349.34" dur="6.6">him about this full deep state crime and</text>
  <text start="353.449" dur="4.621">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s something most people</text>
  <text start="355.94" dur="4.5">won&amp;#39;t know about except if they listen</text>
  <text start="358.07" dur="4.349">to the alternative media so I mean I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="360.44" dur="4.729">been on a lot of different programs I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="362.419" dur="5.161">been on Russia Today Sputnik Press TV</text>

  <text start="374.539" dur="3.75">never changes because it&amp;#39;s true and</text>
  <text start="376.099" dur="4.771">everything&amp;#39;s documented so I can stand</text>
  <text start="378.289" dur="4.711">in front of the Senate gearing and talk</text>
  <text start="380.87" dur="4.59">and tell about this and it&amp;#39;s all</text>

  <text start="385.46" dur="2.85">all of this came to be through</text>
  <text start="386.509" dur="3.03">unclassified channels and that&amp;#39;s why it</text>
  <text start="388.31" dur="4.32">scares the hell out of the deep State</text>
  <text start="389.539" dur="5.671">because all of this that I know I report</text>
  <text start="392.63" dur="4.469">to people to the American public to say</text>

  <text start="440.07" dur="4.319">covered up the aiding and abetting of</text>
  <text start="441.63" dur="6.45">terrorist financing and anyone who fails</text>
  <text start="444.389" dur="6.09">to act chooses not to act is acting and</text>
  <text start="448.08" dur="5.1">is violating the law and committing a</text>
  <text start="450.479" dur="5.881">felony if not treason by their refusal</text>
  <text start="453.18" dur="4.769">to act so it is through reports like</text>
  <text start="456.36" dur="4.17">this whistleblowing reports that the</text>

  <text start="475.56" dur="4.47">deal of affection and sympathy and</text>
  <text start="477.57" dur="4.529">desire to communicate this issue because</text>
  <text start="480.03" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s not partisan Dustin it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="482.099" dur="3.661">nonpartisan issue and I would be</text>
  <text start="483.72" dur="4.199">comfortable talking to any liberal</text>
  <text start="485.76" dur="5.25">leftist Democrat as I would conservative</text>
  <text start="487.919" dur="5.341">Republican libertarian to say look you</text>

  <text start="496.889" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;ll answer any question but this is</text>
  <text start="499.349" dur="4.951">such a trauma to our nation we cannot</text>
  <text start="501.449" dur="5.701">survive it we need people shedding the</text>
  <text start="504.3" dur="4.589">badge of partisanship and going in and</text>
  <text start="507.15" dur="2.97">yes you you know there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="508.889" dur="3.511">things on the plate that we want to</text>
  <text start="510.12" dur="5.849">create and political life in America</text>
  <text start="512.4" dur="6.809">whether it&amp;#39;s from you know taxes and and</text>
  <text start="515.969" dur="6.091">you know civil rights or environment</text>
  <text start="519.209" dur="4.591">stuff but this is this is something we</text>
  <text start="522.06" dur="3.719">cannot survive if we don&amp;#39;t correct it</text>
  <text start="523.8" dur="3.69">because it is the proof that the</text>
  <text start="525.779" dur="3.451">American government has a deep state</text>
  <text start="527.49" dur="3.719">operation that is engaged in military</text>
  <text start="529.23" dur="3.96">industrial activities all across the</text>
  <text start="531.209" dur="3.481">globe it is responsible for the</text>
  <text start="533.19" dur="3.54">resurgence of another coal</text>
  <text start="534.69" dur="4.41">or its responsible for the regime change</text>
  <text start="536.73" dur="5.88">operations against Libya Ukraine Syria</text>
  <text start="539.1" dur="5.94">and now Venezuela and this is something</text>
  <text start="542.61" dur="4.95">that is going counter to the to the</text>
  <text start="545.04" dur="4.14">desires of the American people Americans</text>
  <text start="547.56" dur="4.55">and I&amp;#39;ll end it here Americans want</text>

  <text start="552.11" dur="5.53">opportunities for Prosperity and mutual</text>
  <text start="554.91" dur="5.76">collaboration and harmony with the world</text>
  <text start="557.64" dur="4.26">and for that reason they they stood</text>
  <text start="560.67" dur="3.03">against the world</text>
  <text start="561.9" dur="3.78">when Hillary Clinton was running for</text>
  <text start="563.7" dur="3.63">office and promising all sorts of</text>

  <text start="1470.97" dur="5.97">Trump into is once they lure him into</text>
  <text start="1473.64" dur="6.75">this tar pit it&amp;#39;s very hard to disengage</text>

  <text start="1948.659" dur="3.24">curious about is your opinion on what</text>
  <text start="1950.19" dur="3.539">happened with Pelosi and all of her</text>

  <text start="1957.72" dur="4.11">I don&amp;#39;t know many people think that</text>
  <text start="1959.249" dur="4.23">something was planned and Trump grounded</text>

  <text start="1966.119" dur="6.3">and disappear with her family and months</text>
  <text start="1968.279" dur="6.2">worth of luggage well I first of all I</text>
  <text start="1972.419" dur="4.68">think Nancy Pelosi and some of these</text>
  <text start="1974.479" dur="4.33">people at the high levels of government</text>
  <text start="1977.099" dur="4.16">both Republican and Democrat but</text>
  <text start="1978.809" dur="5.281">especially in the Democrat are really</text>
  <text start="1981.259" dur="4.98">traitors but more importantly medically</text>
  <text start="1984.09" dur="5.639">compromised I think they have taken</text>

  <text start="1996.779" dur="4.581">when you study it scientifically</text>
  <text start="1998.159" dur="4.641">so they are medically afflicted</text>
  <text start="2001.36" dur="3.3">to the point where they are losing their</text>

  <text start="2008.89" dur="4.41">fade into a dream state and I think</text>
  <text start="2011.56" dur="3.5">we&amp;#39;re witnessing that in many of the</text>
  <text start="2013.3" dur="4.44">older crowd in the American government</text>
  <text start="2015.06" dur="4.84">fading into a dream state so it&amp;#39;s easy</text>
  <text start="2017.74" dur="3.48">for them to think they&amp;#39;re living in an</text>

  <text start="2034.12" dur="4.11">it happens by medical pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="2036.37" dur="3.6">altering of the mind and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2038.23" dur="4.02">a very real explanation for a lot of</text>
  <text start="2039.97" dur="6.42">these choices and of course the the</text>
