  <text start="120.619" dur="3.901">you know I&amp;#39;ll be friends with not</text>
  <text start="121.79" dur="4.53">Americans anyway you get my point that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="124.52" dur="4.739">the movement largely but it is a</text>
  <text start="126.32" dur="5.4">worldwide movement but diving into the</text>
  <text start="129.259" dur="4.651">news itself and we&amp;#39;ve had we had the</text>
  <text start="131.72" dur="5.46">Democrat debates again which was just a</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="4.799">crazy fest it&amp;#39;s like they they had to</text>
  <text start="137.18" dur="5">compete to see who could you know</text>
  <text start="138.709" dur="10.021">demonize guns and in President Trump and</text>
  <text start="142.18" dur="8.619">order control the worst I guess and in</text>
  <text start="148.73" dur="3.33">Spanish also because it seems like most</text>
  <text start="150.799" dur="2.311">of them we&amp;#39;re trying to also speak</text>
  <text start="152.06" dur="3.84">Spanish I don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="153.11" dur="3.87">trying to get Americans votes anymore it</text>
  <text start="155.9" dur="1.65">may just be that they&amp;#39;re trying to cater</text>
  <text start="156.98" dur="2.7">to the</text>
  <text start="157.55" dur="4.59">which is why they&amp;#39;re talking about I</text>
  <text start="159.68" dur="5.01">think already asked one of them would</text>
  <text start="162.14" dur="5.43">you raise the legal quota from 1 million</text>
  <text start="164.69" dur="4.71">to 2 million per year it&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="167.57" dur="3.75">and we know what they really want we</text>
  <text start="169.4" dur="3.51">know that they want to just get more</text>
  <text start="171.32" dur="4.56">votes they want to flood the country</text>
  <text start="172.91" dur="4.86">with people that largely vote the left</text>
  <text start="175.88" dur="2.25">why because they just don&amp;#39;t know any</text>
  <text start="177.77" dur="1.92">better</text>
  <text start="178.13" dur="4.77">they actually believe the left&amp;#39;s lies</text>
  <text start="179.69" dur="5.67">they get here and they say hey white</text>
  <text start="182.9" dur="4.86">people and Magga hats and Trump are</text>
  <text start="185.36" dur="4.35">racist and we love you and we want to</text>
  <text start="187.76" dur="3.15">give you free things and by the way they</text>
  <text start="189.71" dur="3.45">hate you and they want to kick you out</text>
  <text start="190.91" dur="6.69">and all this other stuff so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="193.16" dur="7.17">basically trying to emotionally appeal</text>
  <text start="197.6" dur="5.49">to many people who don&amp;#39;t know any better</text>
  <text start="200.33" dur="7.59">it&amp;#39;s almost it&amp;#39;s almost as though it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.09" dur="6.51">like it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s always like different</text>
  <text start="207.92" dur="4.8">power differentials in the world right</text>
  <text start="209.6" dur="4.83">like obviously it&amp;#39;s you wouldn&amp;#39;t be in</text>
  <text start="212.72" dur="3.33">the right position if you were an adult</text>
  <text start="214.43" dur="3.03">you beat up a kid right he&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;re way</text>
  <text start="216.05" dur="3.09">more powerful and even if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.46" dur="3.18">attacking you or something like it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="219.14" dur="3.39">even a self-defense thing like if a kid</text>
  <text start="220.64" dur="3.72">punches you and I&amp;#39;m like 5 years old or</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="2.82">something it doesn&amp;#39;t really hurt or</text>
  <text start="224.36" dur="3.47">maybe it hurts a little bit or something</text>
  <text start="225.35" dur="4.8">you don&amp;#39;t go beat them up karate style</text>
  <text start="227.83" dur="4.78">that kind of power differential is</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="3.99">exactly what we&amp;#39;re dealing with here you</text>
  <text start="232.61" dur="3.3">have some fairly intelligent and</text>
  <text start="234.14" dur="4.17">sometimes not always like we have AOC</text>
  <text start="235.91" dur="3.51">and those types just very corrupt and</text>
  <text start="238.31" dur="3.21">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s enough in this system</text>
  <text start="239.42" dur="3.72">sometimes but you have some people who</text>
  <text start="241.52" dur="3.99">are very intelligent very manipulative</text>
  <text start="243.14" dur="4.38">and those people are taking advantage of</text>
  <text start="245.51" dur="4.01">others they&amp;#39;re using words they using</text>
  <text start="247.52" dur="5.73">sophistry they&amp;#39;re using deception lies</text>
  <text start="249.52" dur="6.13">manipulations ploys stratagems to</text>
  <text start="253.25" dur="4.2">manipulate folks but at the end of the</text>
  <text start="255.65" dur="3.87">day that&amp;#39;s all it really is these folks</text>
  <text start="257.45" dur="4.08">are bullies I really don&amp;#39;t like bullies</text>
  <text start="259.52" dur="3.87">and they&amp;#39;re taking advantage of people</text>
  <text start="261.53" dur="4.139">not only even just American citizens for</text>
  <text start="263.39" dur="4.26">their I mean these illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="265.669" dur="4.321">you know visa some of them are actually</text>
  <text start="267.65" dur="4.92">you know good-hearted people they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="269.99" dur="4.14">all like rapey and criminals and</text>
  <text start="272.57" dur="4.44">murderers and gang members and and drug</text>
  <text start="274.13" dur="4.44">dealers and ms-13 and Isis and all the</text>
  <text start="277.01" dur="3.59">other things that we absolutely have</text>
  <text start="278.57" dur="4.32">coming into our country from the border</text>
  <text start="280.6" dur="4.75">you know they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re not all</text>
  <text start="282.89" dur="4.01">carrying bombs and guns and massive</text>
  <text start="285.35" dur="3.289">drugs and showing up with chill</text>
  <text start="286.9" dur="3.84">that are not their own and being allowed</text>
  <text start="288.639" dur="4.37">to just leave and go into our country</text>
  <text start="290.74" dur="7.38">with those children can&amp;#39;t help us</text>
  <text start="293.009" dur="7.03">however the people among that group are</text>
  <text start="298.12" dur="3.84">also suffering greatly because of what</text>
  <text start="300.039" dur="3.69">these people are doing now the Democrats</text>
  <text start="301.96" dur="3.81">are luring them here with all of these</text>
  <text start="303.729" dur="4.051">promises and they&amp;#39;re not going to happen</text>
  <text start="305.77" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re not going to yield the results</text>
  <text start="307.78" dur="3.509">that they thought that they were to come</text>
  <text start="309.49" dur="5.19">and come to America it&amp;#39;s all great it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.289" dur="5.401">all free and then and then you get here</text>
  <text start="314.68" dur="3.54">and it&amp;#39;s not and we do want to send you</text>
  <text start="316.69" dur="3.21">home because you came illegally and now</text>
  <text start="318.22" dur="4.5">you&amp;#39;re stuck you probably can&amp;#39;t get a</text>
  <text start="319.9" dur="4.2">job if you do is it&amp;#39;s at risk at all</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="3.36">times you&amp;#39;re always gonna have to watch</text>
  <text start="324.1" dur="4.05">your back it&amp;#39;s not the kind of thing you</text>
  <text start="326.08" dur="4.95">want to actually live in that kind of</text>
  <text start="328.15" dur="4.35">condition now many people would</text>
  <text start="331.03" dur="3.84">definitely come to America to escape</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="3.78">whatever hellhole that they&amp;#39;re in or you</text>
  <text start="334.87" dur="4.38">know just to try to get some opportunity</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="5.609">the problem is that that&amp;#39;s not our</text>
  <text start="339.25" dur="5.789">problem and I don&amp;#39;t mean that to be in a</text>
  <text start="341.889" dur="7.291">bad sense or a bad a bad way or to be</text>
  <text start="345.039" dur="6.301">mean or unkind the problem is that your</text>
  <text start="349.18" dur="4.019">house is falling apart and you want to</text>
  <text start="351.34" dur="3.57">bring your problems to our house which</text>
