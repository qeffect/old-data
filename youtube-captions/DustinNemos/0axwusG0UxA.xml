  <text start="181.63" dur="3.93">currency something like gold something</text>
  <text start="183.91" dur="4.74">like a gold and silver currency would</text>
  <text start="185.56" dur="5.64">alleviate most human corruption in the</text>
  <text start="188.65" dur="4.559">world because heck if you&amp;#39;re corrupting</text>
  <text start="191.2" dur="4.05">money you&amp;#39;re corrupting half of every</text>

  <text start="210.579" dur="7.071">back to sticks but these things actually</text>
  <text start="213.69" dur="7.75">kept a very strong hold on corruption</text>
  <text start="217.65" dur="6.04">now we can borrow and we can spend the</text>
  <text start="221.44" dur="4.38">chattel you know the slave chattel the</text>

  <text start="228.28" dur="4.77">does not pair well with corruption and</text>
  <text start="230.68" dur="4.18">evil people who seek power and tyranny</text>

  <text start="436.28" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re trying to get out there in the</text>
  <text start="437.78" dur="3.54">public perception and control some</text>
  <text start="439.4" dur="5.37">narrative themselves because they have a</text>
  <text start="441.32" dur="7.89">lot to risk ask you says those who</text>
  <text start="444.77" dur="6.96">scream the loudest now continuing on we</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="5.37">also have the g7 climate meeting as I</text>
  <text start="451.73" dur="6.98">said it was snubbed Trump didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="454.58" dur="6.57">show up here is his empty chair and I</text>
  <text start="458.71" dur="7.21">love how they&amp;#39;ve got it Donald Trump and</text>
  <text start="461.15" dur="8">the last names all caps there they are</text>
  <text start="465.92" dur="5.73">out there talking about you know these</text>
  <text start="469.15" dur="5.56">wildfires for example in the Amazon</text>
  <text start="471.65" dur="4.89">which you know not as bad as it&amp;#39;s as</text>
  <text start="474.71" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s been made to sound by the way and</text>
  <text start="476.54" dur="5.76">then secondly and usually forest fires</text>
  <text start="479.69" dur="4.35">aren&amp;#39;t unless people are harmed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="482.3" dur="3.57">actually kind of a natural reset for the</text>
  <text start="484.04" dur="3.27">planet and it&amp;#39;s actually good for the</text>
  <text start="485.87" dur="3.45">forests every once in a while too it</text>
  <text start="487.31" dur="4.74">prevents a lot of the bacterial mold</text>
  <text start="489.32" dur="4.31">growth kind of stuff that destroys the</text>
  <text start="492.05" dur="4.23">underbrush and then eventually the trees</text>
  <text start="493.63" dur="5.05">you know I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not a tree</text>
  <text start="496.28" dur="3.83">agricultural guy and my experience and</text>
  <text start="498.68" dur="2.87">knowledge with trees are kind of limited</text>
  <text start="500.11" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="4.23">maple syrup stuff before in the maple in</text>
  <text start="504.13" dur="2.73">the sugar bush but uh that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="505.78" dur="4.02">about it</text>
  <text start="506.86" dur="4.98">more than animals and you know in</text>
  <text start="509.8" dur="5.31">Green&amp;#39;s kind of thing when I&amp;#39;m farming</text>
  <text start="511.84" dur="6.03">but anyway just to kind of get the point</text>
  <text start="515.11" dur="6.33">though there goes my phone the point is</text>
  <text start="517.87" dur="5.01">that these different countries are still</text>
  <text start="521.44" dur="3.6">getting together to push this to this</text>
  <text start="522.88" dur="4.02">weird deception that that the climate is</text>
  <text start="525.04" dur="3.36">in danger we&amp;#39;re the reason for it and we</text>
  <text start="526.9" dur="4.02">have to then give up all of our freedoms</text>
  <text start="528.4" dur="4.44">and money and probably you know starve</text>
  <text start="530.92" dur="3.51">to death the third world which is</text>
  <text start="532.84" dur="3.69">exactly what would happen in the kind of</text>
  <text start="534.43" dur="4.65">policies if we really allowed these</text>
  <text start="536.53" dur="5.12">policies to go forward the third world</text>
  <text start="539.08" dur="5.82">would experience a massive starvation</text>
  <text start="541.65" dur="5.2">but basically that goes right along with</text>
  <text start="544.9" dur="4.68">what they want right royalty population</text>
  <text start="546.85" dur="4.89">and stuff this is a culture among the</text>
  <text start="549.58" dur="4.11">world&amp;#39;s powerful and elite Trump does</text>
  <text start="551.74" dur="4.11">not share that belief in that culture</text>
  <text start="553.69" dur="5.04">and that is why he didn&amp;#39;t show up he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.85" dur="5.31">not gonna use these scams to carbon tax</text>
  <text start="558.73" dur="4.17">and trade us and manipulate the markets</text>
  <text start="561.16" dur="3.87">even more and destroy all legitimate</text>
  <text start="562.9" dur="4.23">business and basically enrich the chrony</text>
  <text start="565.03" dur="4.41">for you and rape some more kids until</text>
  <text start="567.13" dur="4.95">eventually that system falls apart to</text>
  <text start="569.44" dur="5.52">he&amp;#39;s saying no more we&amp;#39;ve had enough of</text>
  <text start="572.08" dur="4.85">this BS remember some context for those</text>
  <text start="574.96" dur="5.34">who are kind of new to the issue of</text>
  <text start="576.93" dur="5.71">global warming debating you know it&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="580.3" dur="4.8">was it was global cooling back in the</text>
  <text start="582.64" dur="4.5">80s we were gonna freeze to death and</text>
  <text start="585.1" dur="4.17">nothing&amp;#39;s gonna grow then it was global</text>
  <text start="587.14" dur="4.02">warming and then all of those</text>
  <text start="589.27" dur="3.33">predictions failed to pan out all of the</text>
  <text start="591.16" dur="2.85">science behind it became you know</text>
  <text start="592.6" dur="2.7">exposed for being corrupt like</text>
  <text start="594.01" dur="3.69">Climategate emails where they were</text>
  <text start="595.3" dur="3.96">faking the data and then it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="597.7" dur="3.03">change to climate change because well</text>
  <text start="599.26" dur="2.76">it&amp;#39;s not really actually getting any</text>
  <text start="600.73" dur="3.48">warmer it&amp;#39;s actually getting colder</text>
  <text start="602.02" dur="4.5">because you know being based on the sun</text>
  <text start="604.21" dur="4.31">cycle the world just does that every so</text>
  <text start="606.52" dur="4.26">often we go through hot and cold periods</text>

  <text start="610.78" dur="4.35">mostly based on the Sun not humans so</text>
  <text start="613.54" dur="3.72">kind of the short version is that they</text>
  <text start="615.13" dur="4.71">were faking it all so that they could</text>
  <text start="617.26" dur="4.38">and of course tax us and control us more</text>
  <text start="619.84" dur="3.66">something all the government&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="621.64" dur="4.56">agree on because hey why not more power</text>
  <text start="623.5" dur="5.22">this is just a pretext and excuse to</text>
  <text start="626.2" dur="5.04">steal from you and to rob you of your</text>
  <text start="628.72" dur="3.96">hard-earned labor and freedoms so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="631.24" dur="2.57">what governments do and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="632.68" dur="2.99">they&amp;#39;ve always do</text>
  <text start="633.81" dur="3.779">so you know Trump being the rare</text>
  <text start="635.67" dur="4.579">exception the good King kind of figure</text>
  <text start="637.589" dur="6.151">which he&amp;#39;s not a king but you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="640.249" dur="5.83">theoretically it&amp;#39;s the the benevolent</text>

  <text start="653.759" dur="4.95">insane or crazy and then evil or the</text>
  <text start="656.069" dur="5.101">next one after right so it&amp;#39;s not a good</text>
  <text start="658.709" dur="4.081">form of government long term so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="661.17" dur="3.99">kind of a long way of getting back to</text>
  <text start="662.79" dur="4.169">the point here Trump is making a</text>
  <text start="665.16" dur="4.56">difference in this and it only really</text>
  <text start="666.959" dur="4.591">takes one it only really takes one</text>
  <text start="669.72" dur="5.549">leader to stand out and make an example</text>
  <text start="671.55" dur="5.399">and to say this is BS this is a lie or I</text>
  <text start="675.269" dur="4.591">think he called it dreams or whatever</text>
  <text start="676.949" dur="6.211">kind of in a little bit of a sideways</text>
  <text start="679.86" dur="6.029">snob but um yeah he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="683.16" dur="5.31">focusing on on American wealth he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="685.889" dur="4.74">talking about focusing on American</text>
  <text start="688.47" dur="3.69">prosperity and he says I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="690.629" dur="3.661">lose that wealth I&amp;#39;m not going to lose</text>
  <text start="692.16" dur="5.07">it on dreams on windmills which frankly</text>
  <text start="694.29" dur="5.01">aren&amp;#39;t working too well and he&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="697.23" dur="4.2">now I&amp;#39;m a big fan of alternative energy</text>
  <text start="699.3" dur="3.63">and I think that you should incorporate</text>
  <text start="701.43" dur="4.949">some of that into your life for freedom</text>
  <text start="702.93" dur="5.579">purposes but I do not think that we</text>
  <text start="706.379" dur="5.101">should destroy things like clean coal in</text>
  <text start="708.509" dur="4.921">the name of alternative energy and then</text>
  <text start="711.48" dur="4.62">give all the you know all of the</text>
  <text start="713.43" dur="6.149">contracts and profit to companies like</text>
  <text start="716.1" dur="5.219">Tesla for example who are then being</text>
  <text start="719.579" dur="3.24">sued by companies like Amazon and</text>
  <text start="721.319" dur="2.911">Walmart because all of their solar</text>
  <text start="722.819" dur="2.88">panels are falling apart at SolarCity</text>
  <text start="724.23" dur="4.349">and breaking down and then starting</text>
  <text start="725.699" dur="4.74">fires and everything else so now</text>
  <text start="728.579" dur="3.3">Walmart&amp;#39;s across the country have these</text>
  <text start="730.439" dur="3.02">solar panels on their roof that are</text>
  <text start="731.879" dur="4.411">starting fires they had to turn them off</text>
  <text start="733.459" dur="3.461">crazy that is the kind of quality you</text>
  <text start="736.29" dur="5.06">get shopping</text>
  <text start="736.92" dur="6.56">Elon Musk but this climate change agenda</text>
  <text start="741.35" dur="4.27">it&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="743.48" dur="4.24">remember even in this country we have</text>
  <text start="745.62" dur="3.6">also and I don&amp;#39;t remember that the</text>
  <text start="747.72" dur="4.83">official title of the group or whatever</text>
  <text start="749.22" dur="5.279">but Trump convened a group to look into</text>
  <text start="752.55" dur="4.349">the science behind climate change to</text>
  <text start="754.499" dur="4.59">kind of reassess it we need that for</text>
  <text start="756.899" dur="2.73">vaccines too by the way but it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="759.089" dur="4.35">sign</text>
  <text start="759.629" dur="5.791">so as the g7 leaders discuss this false</text>
  <text start="763.439" dur="4.121">problem so that they can give you their</text>
  <text start="765.42" dur="5.98">you know real solutions that</text>
  <text start="767.56" dur="6.81">bad for you and good for them Trump was</text>
  <text start="771.4" dur="7.08">focusing on America and that says it all</text>
  <text start="774.37" dur="7.05">so we also have Vanity Fair interviewing</text>
  <text start="778.48" dur="4.77">and Epstein accuser back in the day but</text>
  <text start="781.42" dur="4.8">they never published their report after</text>
  <text start="783.25" dur="4.589">Epstein visited the offices why</text>
  <text start="786.22" dur="5.43">maybe it&amp;#39;s because a severed cat head</text>
  <text start="787.839" dur="7.471">was found in the yard yeah right so this</text>
  <text start="791.65" dur="4.92">is the kind of stuff that happens you</text>
  <text start="795.31" dur="3.33">start to look into it</text>
  <text start="796.57" dur="4.8">so former Vanity Fair editor-in-chief</text>
  <text start="798.64" dur="5.01">Graydon Carter made a disto disturbing</text>
  <text start="801.37" dur="5.73">discovery on his front lawn the severed</text>
  <text start="803.65" dur="4.98">head of a cat just after a report had</text>
  <text start="807.1" dur="3.42">started digging started digging into</text>
  <text start="808.63" dur="4.89">Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s alleged Mis sexual</text>
  <text start="810.52" dur="4.53">misconduct so basically this is the kind</text>
  <text start="813.52" dur="3.69">of stuff that they&amp;#39;ll use to intimidate</text>
  <text start="815.05" dur="4.47">you you know it might even be your cat</text>
  <text start="817.21" dur="4.08">okay so that&amp;#39;s the kind of stuff that</text>
  <text start="819.52" dur="5.19">they do and then it ramps up from there</text>
  <text start="821.29" dur="5.85">they try to get you quietly if they can</text>
  <text start="824.71" dur="4.11">with with maybe the legal system or or</text>
  <text start="827.14" dur="3.08">maybe something of that nature they try</text>
  <text start="828.82" dur="4.44">to make it look like a suicide</text>
  <text start="830.22" dur="6.07">if they have to but you know it always</text>
  <text start="833.26" dur="5.85">starts with with the low risk you know</text>
  <text start="836.29" dur="4.68">high ROI kind of things I mean I imagine</text>
  <text start="839.11" dur="3.99">if you leave it like a severed cat head</text>
  <text start="840.97" dur="3.96">on most people&amp;#39;s doorsteps they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="843.1" dur="4.26">probably going to get the message and</text>
  <text start="844.93" dur="4.05">quit right that&amp;#39;s pretty low risk what</text>
  <text start="847.36" dur="3.93">if you get caught when you killed a cat</text>
  <text start="848.98" dur="3.84">I think it&amp;#39;s a terrible thing to do but</text>
  <text start="851.29" dur="4.47">criminally speaking you&amp;#39;re not gonna go</text>
  <text start="852.82" dur="6.06">away for it not forever</text>
  <text start="855.76" dur="5.13">and then what happens in that well maybe</text>
  <text start="858.88" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;ve taken out their dog we&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="860.89" dur="4.1">lot of truthers whose dogs were poisoned</text>
  <text start="862.63" dur="5.459">or killed in mysterious circumstances</text>
  <text start="864.99" dur="7.03">and then they ramp up from there and as</text>
  <text start="868.089" dur="5.071">the the logical thing that a psychopath</text>
  <text start="872.02" dur="4.17">like Epstein would do</text>
  <text start="873.16" dur="5.07">he&amp;#39;d ramp up but this guy got the</text>
  <text start="876.19" dur="3.99">message he was quiet and he didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="878.23" dur="3.359">to be disappeared now other people have</text>
  <text start="880.18" dur="3.87">disappeared people that are looking into</text>
  <text start="881.589" dur="3.62">the clintons even government agents just</text>
  <text start="884.05" dur="3.6">died</text>
  <text start="885.209" dur="3.971">suicides you know bullets to the back of</text>
  <text start="887.65" dur="5.1">the head suicides that kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="889.18" dur="5.31">even the day before testifying sometimes</text>
  <text start="892.75" dur="4.74">even multiple agents in the same year</text>
  <text start="894.49" dur="4.35">the day before testifying geez how much</text>
  <text start="897.49" dur="4.44">more obvious does it need to be</text>
  <text start="898.84" dur="5.16">now conveniently the camera footage</text>
  <text start="901.93" dur="8.45">outside of Epstein&amp;#39;s prison cell was</text>
  <text start="904" dur="9.3">deemed unusable yeah right</text>
  <text start="910.38" dur="5.17">Yeah right it&amp;#39;s all you can say who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="913.3" dur="3.66">buying this anymore and I did want to</text>
  <text start="915.55" dur="3.99">kind of give an honorable mention to</text>
  <text start="916.96" dur="5.1">this article why are we funding PBS</text>
  <text start="919.54" dur="4.23">unhinged PBS crank who called President</text>
  <text start="922.06" dur="3.66">Trump a white nationalist is now also</text>
  <text start="923.77" dur="4.5">calling him a liar at the g7 press</text>

  <text start="931.3" dur="3.81">outfits you know I hear him on the radio</text>
  <text start="932.77" dur="3.99">all the time it was about the only thing</text>
  <text start="935.11" dur="3.14">I could get that spoke English when I</text>

  <text start="940.72" dur="4.59">radio shows are in French there&amp;#39;s only a</text>
  <text start="943.21" dur="4.53">few there and PBS is one of them so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="945.31" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;ve gotten plenty of an earful about</text>
  <text start="947.74" dur="3.3">how they just sit there and bash Trump</text>
  <text start="949.42" dur="4.02">the entire time they&amp;#39;re on air basically</text>
  <text start="951.04" dur="4.59">and they just push that mainstream</text>
  <text start="953.44" dur="5.07">narrative it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not public</text>
  <text start="955.63" dur="4.41">broadcasts by any means no it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="958.51" dur="6.17">more like the union&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s corrupted</text>
  <text start="960.04" dur="8.25">it&amp;#39;s taken over anyway just another</text>
  <text start="964.68" dur="6.76">terrible fake news reporter trying to</text>
  <text start="968.29" dur="4.53">attack our president no surprise there</text>
  <text start="971.44" dur="2.58">but the point though is that we should</text>
  <text start="972.82" dur="2.19">not be funding it and that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="974.02" dur="2.64">what I was talking about earlier we</text>
  <text start="975.01" dur="4.14">shouldn&amp;#39;t be funding Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="976.66" dur="5.76">we shouldn&amp;#39;t be funding propaganda lying</text>
  <text start="979.15" dur="4.95">to us we shouldn&amp;#39;t be funding 99.99% of</text>
  <text start="982.42" dur="4.23">the things the government does which by</text>
  <text start="984.1" dur="4.02">the way are done through force because</text>
  <text start="986.65" dur="3.78">if you don&amp;#39;t fund it they&amp;#39;re gonna shoot</text>
  <text start="988.12" dur="5.25">you if you try to resist them taking you</text>
  <text start="990.43" dur="4.53">to a cage okay and that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="993.37" dur="3.39">going back to the argument everybody</text>
  <text start="994.96" dur="3.81">doesn&amp;#39;t like to talk about it because it</text>
  <text start="996.76" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s an uncomfortable argument but</text>
  <text start="998.77" dur="6.12">taxation is theft and remember our</text>
  <text start="1001.5" dur="6.69">country was founded largely after things</text>
  <text start="1004.89" dur="7.14">like was it a 2% or 1% tax on tea I</text>
  <text start="1008.19" dur="6.18">think he was 2% and and they got mad</text>
  <text start="1012.03" dur="8.3">they dumped it in the ocean and then</text>
  <text start="1014.37" dur="9.089">what so nowadays you give up a half</text>
  <text start="1020.33" dur="6.52">probably more with all the fees and</text>
  <text start="1023.459" dur="4.051">regulations and then taxes on top we are</text>
  <text start="1026.85" dur="2.849">slaves</text>
  <text start="1027.51" dur="4.24">it&amp;#39;s the it&amp;#39;s the new form of slavery</text>
  <text start="1029.699" dur="3.521">where you think that you&amp;#39;re free</text>
  <text start="1031.75" dur="3.18">and the bankers wrote about it in their</text>
  <text start="1033.22" dur="3.96">letters I don&amp;#39;t remember the right one</text>
  <text start="1034.93" dur="4.529">and the exact quote but basically the</text>
  <text start="1037.18" dur="4.17">old form of slavery was when the slave</text>
  <text start="1039.459" dur="3.961">owner had to take care of the slaves and</text>
  <text start="1041.35" dur="4.41">feed and house them give the medical</text>
  <text start="1043.42" dur="4.38">care the new form is the slave takes</text>
  <text start="1045.76" dur="4.11">care of themselves and feed and houses</text>
  <text start="1047.8" dur="6.69">themselves because they&amp;#39;re the wage</text>

  <text start="1255.94" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s it for now guys I just kind of</text>
  <text start="1258.46" dur="4.89">wanted to to go through a few of those</text>
  <text start="1260.35" dur="6.51">things with you powerful things at least</text>
  <text start="1263.35" dur="5.1">in my opinion and I wanted to make sure</text>
  <text start="1266.86" dur="3.21">that you were aware you know these are</text>
  <text start="1268.45" dur="3.75">trends in the news so to speak and these</text>
  <text start="1270.07" dur="4.71">are portents of things to come</text>
  <text start="1272.2" dur="5.07">now 2020 is of course still ramping up</text>
  <text start="1274.78" dur="3.99">and in kind of a little side note is</text>
  <text start="1277.27" dur="3.54">that Biden&amp;#39;s falling in the third even</text>
  <text start="1278.77" dur="3.99">in his own party that&amp;#39;s supposed to make</text>
  <text start="1280.81" dur="3.42">him the favorite or whatever so it</text>
  <text start="1282.76" dur="3.54">doesn&amp;#39;t look like he&amp;#39;s gonna make it</text>
  <text start="1284.23" dur="4.05">he&amp;#39;s already kind of apologizing for his</text>
  <text start="1286.3" dur="3.78">own gaffe saying it&amp;#39;s not what was it he</text>
  <text start="1288.28" dur="4.35">said he&amp;#39;s not crazy he&amp;#39;s not going crazy</text>
  <text start="1290.08" dur="4.11">something like that anyway the point is</text>
  <text start="1292.63" dur="5.06">that Biden just can&amp;#39;t keep up</text>
  <text start="1294.19" dur="5.88">intellectually energetically or you know</text>
  <text start="1297.69" dur="3.97">also all the baggage dragging him down</text>
  <text start="1300.07" dur="4.68">like all the kids he&amp;#39;s molested on</text>
  <text start="1301.66" dur="5.16">camera basically you know and by</text>
  <text start="1304.75" dur="4.68">molesting it means basically groping</text>
  <text start="1306.82" dur="4.47">them without consent and in making them</text>
  <text start="1309.43" dur="5.16">uncomfortable on camera numerous times</text>
  <text start="1311.29" dur="6.06">women children it&amp;#39;s weird if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1314.59" dur="5.25">seen that check it out so you know Biden</text>
  <text start="1317.35" dur="6.48">is a bit of a predator it seems so</text>
  <text start="1319.84" dur="6.03">anyway kind of I guess closing out if</text>
  <text start="1323.83" dur="3.42">you value this work if you think this is</text>
  <text start="1325.87" dur="3.87">important if you want to keep getting</text>

  <text start="1346.69" dur="6.06">for a video and it actually got me to</text>
  <text start="1350.14" dur="3.96">30,000 subscribers that month because it</text>
  <text start="1352.75" dur="2.52">switched off whatever they were doing</text>
  <text start="1354.1" dur="2.67">they thought I was some kind of paying</text>
  <text start="1355.27" dur="4.14">customer and then they found it and they</text>
  <text start="1356.77" dur="5.22">caught it and in January when they made</text>
  <text start="1359.41" dur="4.65">the algorithm changes I was frozen at 96</text>
