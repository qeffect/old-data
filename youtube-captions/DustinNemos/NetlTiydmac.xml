  <text start="98.56" dur="3.48">time call me and McCabe are basically</text>
  <text start="100.54" dur="4.35">just trashing each other in the media</text>

  <text start="121.1" dur="8.23">ex-convicts so you know high high high</text>
  <text start="125.13" dur="6.9">rate of criminality their message is in</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="5.489">the background sorry about that Infowars</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="5.16">is reporting that mexico is agreeing to</text>
  <text start="134.819" dur="4.441">pay for the wall that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="137.19" dur="5.25">clickbait t kind of true it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="139.26" dur="5.85">more about the nafta deal and if mexico</text>
  <text start="142.44" dur="4.14">closes this massive loophole in nafta</text>
  <text start="145.11" dur="4.14">that lets other countries pour things</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="6.06">through mexico to get to us and bypass</text>
  <text start="149.25" dur="5.569">any kind of tariffs or anything which</text>
  <text start="152.64" dur="5.58">has basically helped to hollow out our</text>
  <text start="154.819" dur="4.571">manufacturing if we were able to get rid</text>
  <text start="158.22" dur="3.96">of that it would more than pay for the</text>
  <text start="159.39" dur="4.349">wall so in a way mexico is conceding to</text>
  <text start="162.18" dur="5.07">a point that would create a lot of</text>
  <text start="163.739" dur="6.241">profit for the US or los you know we get</text>
  <text start="167.25" dur="4.17">rid of losses at least and that would</text>
  <text start="169.98" dur="2.58">more than pay for the wall i don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="171.42" dur="2.94">they actually came out and said we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="172.56" dur="4.29">gonna pay for the wall though so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="3.629">kind of click Beatty kind of not if</text>
  <text start="176.85" dur="3.449">you&amp;#39;re willing to accept that it was</text>
  <text start="177.989" dur="4.171">hyperbolic in metaphor and whenever</text>
  <text start="180.299" dur="4.111">Trump said that he was gonna have Mexico</text>
  <text start="182.16" dur="4.5">pay for the wall maybe he didn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="184.41" dur="7.5">like straight cash maybe he meant and</text>
  <text start="186.66" dur="7.07">improve budget or deficit and after you</text>
  <text start="191.91" dur="5.12">do it</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="5.22">and here&amp;#39;s something really troubling an</text>

  <text start="204.02" dur="3.32">positioned for an attack okay I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="206.15" dur="3.09">read a little bit of this article</text>
  <text start="207.34" dur="4.66">Iranian backed militants are operating</text>

  <text start="242.12" dur="4.71">Tuesday that such an attack is not only</text>
  <text start="244.1" dur="4.35">plausible but relatively easy for Iran</text>
  <text start="246.83" dur="4.14">to carry out at a time when the Trump</text>
  <text start="248.45" dur="4.8">administration is considering abandoning</text>
  <text start="250.97" dur="5.82">the landmark nuclear deal and reapplying</text>

  <text start="262.27" dur="3.82">it&amp;#39;s not hard to believe you know</text>
  <text start="264.2" dur="5.64">Muslims using terrorist attacks and I</text>
  <text start="266.09" dur="6.48">would have thought it right but combine</text>
  <text start="269.84" dur="5.46">that with this so the feds are searching</text>
  <text start="272.57" dur="6.87">for six hundred plus pounds of stolen</text>
  <text start="275.3" dur="6.75">dynamite in rural Pennsylvania this is</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="5.57">enough blasting power to take out three</text>
  <text start="282.05" dur="5.13">of the owl&amp;#39;s or car.we bunkers okay so</text>
  <text start="285.01" dur="4.47">if you&amp;#39;ve been paying attention kind of</text>
  <text start="287.18" dur="4.53">what&amp;#39;s going on in certain parts of this</text>
  <text start="289.48" dur="4.72">Isis war on everyone else and this</text>
  <text start="291.71" dur="4.29">terrorist want everyone else terrorists</text>
  <text start="294.2" dur="3.3">like to dig tunnels under bunkers and</text>
  <text start="296" dur="3.69">then fill them up with explosives and</text>
  <text start="297.5" dur="4.83">blow the whole bunker that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="299.69" dur="5.37">their way of getting around armored</text>
  <text start="302.33" dur="5.31">fortifications and they can spend a long</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="4.41">time digging these tunnels one of them</text>
  <text start="307.64" dur="3.39">just recently one of the bigger ones</text>
  <text start="309.47" dur="3.15">that we&amp;#39;ve ever seen just recently went</text>
  <text start="311.03" dur="6.24">often took out an entire base on a</text>
  <text start="312.62" dur="6.84">hilltop pretty amazing stuff so 600</text>
  <text start="317.27" dur="4.38">pounds of dynamite stolen in the US</text>
  <text start="319.46" dur="5.55">could be used for all sorts of mischief</text>
  <text start="321.65" dur="7.98">in the US is my concern especially when</text>
  <text start="325.01" dur="7.47">we already have extensive jihadi you</text>
  <text start="329.63" dur="5.58">know sleeper cells definitely no</text>
  <text start="332.48" dur="8.13">surprise of course Obama was basically</text>
  <text start="335.21" dur="7.74">the Muslim mentorian candidate for Saudi</text>
  <text start="340.61" dur="5.79">Arabia in the deep State and you know</text>
  <text start="342.95" dur="5.76">full-on communist full-on Muslim he even</text>
  <text start="346.4" dur="4.23">slipped up twice and said his his mother</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="3.24">at least once and said his Muslim faith</text>
  <text start="350.63" dur="3.81">when he meant to say his Christian faith</text>
  <text start="351.95" dur="5.48">and twice when he talked about his wife</text>
  <text start="354.44" dur="5.34">Michael anyway</text>
  <text start="357.43" dur="5.02">interestingly Trump confirmed that Mike</text>
  <text start="359.78" dur="5.04">Pompeo actually went to meet Kim Jong on</text>
  <text start="362.45" dur="3.779">in North Korea and at the same point we</text>
  <text start="364.82" dur="4.08">know that North Korea and South Korea</text>
  <text start="366.229" dur="4.321">are about to announce the end the</text>
  <text start="368.9" dur="5.41">official end of the war that never</text>
  <text start="370.55" dur="6.34">really ended it&amp;#39;s been going for decades</text>
  <text start="374.31" dur="4.68">a quiet war because we had overwhelming</text>
  <text start="376.89" dur="4.86">firepower ready to crush them if they</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="6.69">ever across the that imaginary line</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="5.4">between the Koreas there but this is</text>
  <text start="385.68" dur="2.91">pretty massive I mean you&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="387.15" dur="4.17">lot of new things out of North Korea</text>
  <text start="388.59" dur="4.77">including the throwing the idea of de</text>
  <text start="391.32" dur="3.78">nuclear you know deep nuclearization out</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="4.62">there Trump hasn&amp;#39;t really been talking</text>
  <text start="395.1" dur="5.61">about it much but you know kim jung-han</text>
  <text start="397.98" dur="6.3">is bringing it up now please please take</text>
  <text start="400.71" dur="7.08">my nukes it&amp;#39;s definitely a change in the</text>
  <text start="404.28" dur="5.91">right direction and even Putin is saying</text>
  <text start="407.79" dur="7.53">that he&amp;#39;s ready to make deep concessions</text>
  <text start="410.19" dur="8.13">give a lot up and orders the ease of</text>
  <text start="415.32" dur="4.97">anti-us rhetoric so he wants to make a</text>
  <text start="418.32" dur="4.98">deal</text>
  <text start="420.29" dur="5.8">and Trump did back off of sanctions by</text>
  <text start="423.3" dur="4.11">the way nikki Haley was all about we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="426.09" dur="4.08">gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna have more sanctions</text>
  <text start="427.41" dur="4.59">and Trump sling they&amp;#39;re not really and</text>
  <text start="430.17" dur="3.15">now she&amp;#39;s having a spat with Trump and</text>
  <text start="432" dur="5.19">she might be the next to go they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.32" dur="6.3">saying and this is really I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="437.19" dur="4.02">show you the video clip but you could</text>
  <text start="439.62" dur="4.38">definitely imagine eight it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="441.21" dur="4.8">stupid video footage shows a CNN</text>
  <text start="444" dur="3.96">reporter visiting visiting victims of</text>
  <text start="446.01" dur="5.1">the numa chemical weapons attack and</text>
  <text start="447.96" dur="6.48">then this is just gonna play right into</text>
  <text start="451.11" dur="5.1">that hole it&amp;#39;s fake narrative and then</text>
  <text start="454.44" dur="5.82">they were sniffing the backpacks like</text>
  <text start="456.21" dur="7.56">she actually leaned over and sniffed the</text>
  <text start="460.26" dur="8.13">backpack of a child victim that</text>
  <text start="463.77" dur="6.84">supposedly had been doused in sarin gas</text>
  <text start="468.39" dur="3">she says there&amp;#39;s definitely something</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="5.31">that stings</text>
  <text start="471.39" dur="6.87">and it&amp;#39;s Arwa Damon is the reporter and</text>
  <text start="475.92" dur="4.44">she also says the smell is still quite</text>
  <text start="478.26" dur="5.07">strong maybe these were the things they</text>
  <text start="480.36" dur="5.61">weren&amp;#39;t able to wash so here&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="4.38">sarin gas which CNN itself reported was</text>
  <text start="485.97" dur="4.2">used in the chemical weapons attack has</text>
  <text start="487.71" dur="5.4">no order and cannot be detected by</text>
  <text start="490.17" dur="4.68">smelling objects also it could kill you</text>
  <text start="493.11" dur="5.97">if you stuff a backpack covered in Sarah</text>
  <text start="494.85" dur="7.11">so CNN once again claims that much</text>
  <text start="499.08" dur="5.72">desired form of being the dumbest and a</text>
  <text start="501.96" dur="2.84">crowd of idiots</text>
  <text start="506.27" dur="8.699">and China is blinking I think so China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.2" dur="3.209">in international trade representative</text>
  <text start="514.969" dur="4.531">held a series of meetings with the</text>
  <text start="516.409" dur="5.82">ambassadors from major European nations</text>
  <text start="519.5" dur="5.37">last week to ask them to stand together</text>
  <text start="522.229" dur="4.561">with Beijing against the US</text>
  <text start="524.87" dur="3.3">protectionism this is the trade war the</text>
  <text start="526.79" dur="3.96">tariffs and everything coming out of</text>
  <text start="528.17" dur="4.71">Trump according to four sources familiar</text>
  <text start="530.75" dur="4.77">with the discussions assistant Reuters</text>
  <text start="532.88" dur="5.49">so basically China is trying to find</text>
  <text start="535.52" dur="4.89">help to stop Trump from whipping China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.37" dur="4.529">but in the trade war and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.41" dur="3.929">basically what&amp;#39;s going on China does</text>
  <text start="542.899" dur="2.221">have some big things I&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="544.339" dur="2.701">it in the past</text>
  <text start="545.12" dur="3.69">they have many options that they could</text>
  <text start="547.04" dur="3.96">do to completely tanked our economy to</text>
  <text start="548.81" dur="4.529">but we still have a lot more to gain</text>
  <text start="551" dur="3.93">than they do from this and by destroying</text>
  <text start="553.339" dur="4.141">the old system we can build something</text>
  <text start="554.93" dur="4.92">better a lot of people are thinking that</text>
  <text start="557.48" dur="5.76">this really is a plan for a currency</text>
  <text start="559.85" dur="6.15">reset to bring down the central banking</text>
  <text start="563.24" dur="4.98">corrupt rigged system behind all of the</text>
  <text start="566" dur="5.13">money printing and you know political</text>
  <text start="568.22" dur="5.79">corruption and loss of 99 percent of our</text>
  <text start="571.13" dur="5.55">value and everything else so I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="574.01" dur="6.93">it said that Trump has Andrew Jackson in</text>
  <text start="576.68" dur="5.88">his office on his wall Andrew Jackson is</text>
  <text start="580.94" dur="4.8">I killed the bank Jackson one of my</text>
  <text start="582.56" dur="4.74">heroes he actually campaigned on getting</text>
  <text start="585.74" dur="4.2">rid of the central bank the original</text>
  <text start="587.3" dur="6.479">central bank before the Fed got back in</text>
  <text start="589.94" dur="5.43">and they tried to kill the man beat him</text>
  <text start="593.779" dur="5.071">with a cane it was just a really cool</text>
  <text start="595.37" dur="5.7">story but if we have another one of</text>
  <text start="598.85" dur="4.53">those in office a real president who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="601.07" dur="4.53">gonna actually take down the Fed what</text>
  <text start="603.38" dur="6.57">better way to do it than to force a</text>
  <text start="605.6" dur="6.91">currency reset by just tainting their</text>
  <text start="609.95" dur="5.56">system on purpose</text>
  <text start="612.51" dur="4.46">interesting we&amp;#39;ll see what happens it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="615.51" dur="3.65">gonna cause a lot of chaos and</text>
  <text start="616.97" dur="6.55">discomfort for the average people though</text>
  <text start="619.16" dur="6.19">so I think a my opinion those who have</text>
  <text start="623.52" dur="3.66">hedges like gold silver or crypto</text>
  <text start="625.35" dur="3.66">currencies wool will do better than</text>
  <text start="627.18" dur="5.28">others and in fact if you have enough</text>
  <text start="629.01" dur="5.1">you&amp;#39;ll probably if there&amp;#39;s a reset look</text>
  <text start="632.46" dur="4.08">at what happened in Venezuela like gold</text>
  <text start="634.11" dur="4.7">went up like through tons of he was</text>
  <text start="636.54" dur="6.15">around 3,000 percent overnight basically</text>
  <text start="638.81" dur="5.92">against the bulbar the Venezuelan</text>
  <text start="642.69" dur="4.98">Bulevar their dollar I think it&amp;#39;s a ball</text>
  <text start="644.73" dur="4.34">of arm so just overnight and it actually</text>
  <text start="647.67" dur="3.69">did better than silver which surprised</text>
  <text start="649.07" dur="4.24">myself and a lot of other people because</text>
  <text start="651.36" dur="4.2">Silver&amp;#39;s far undervalued compared to</text>
  <text start="653.31" dur="4.17">gold but there&amp;#39;s that first thought that</text>
  <text start="655.56" dur="4.02">gold is the currency so silver is</text>
