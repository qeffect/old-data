  <text start="645.5" dur="4.2">to put Cavanaugh&amp;#39;s name in there and</text>
  <text start="646.94" dur="5.22">then they put this out this Oh funny but</text>
  <text start="649.7" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s not a one-off it&amp;#39;s a trend and let</text>
  <text start="652.16" dur="3.33">me let me qualify that Nightline says</text>

  <text start="668.42" dur="3.72">probably the only two that are out there</text>
  <text start="670.28" dur="3.96">this is a trend this is the this is the</text>
  <text start="672.14" dur="3.51">left okay we have to deal with the left</text>
  <text start="674.24" dur="3.41">in their sophistry and we have to deal</text>
  <text start="675.65" dur="5.31">with sophistry on our side too folks</text>
  <text start="677.65" dur="5.62">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people who are you know</text>
  <text start="680.96" dur="4.5">maybe pro Trump and anti Q who then use</text>
  <text start="683.27" dur="4.53">office tree right I would encourage</text>
  <text start="685.46" dur="6.99">anyone on either side of this argument</text>
  <text start="687.8" dur="6.75">to to unify on polite debate an all</text>

  <text start="703.07" dur="3.18">and that kind of stuff because the one</text>
  <text start="704.84" dur="3.51">thing that we should all agree on is</text>
  <text start="706.25" dur="5.48">that well two things is that we support</text>
