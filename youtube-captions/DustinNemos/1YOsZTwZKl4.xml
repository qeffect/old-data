  <text start="405.74" dur="4.62">even heard of before this is I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="408.38" dur="4.47">really good advisors that have got</text>
  <text start="410.36" dur="5.9">plenty of experience in in both local</text>
  <text start="412.85" dur="7.41">and national and even DC level politics</text>
  <text start="416.26" dur="7.51">decades of experience one of my advisors</text>
  <text start="420.26" dur="5.76">nearly was a governor himself and also</text>
  <text start="423.77" dur="3.72">was nearly a senator himself he was a</text>
  <text start="426.02" dur="4.56">heartache he was stopped by a heart</text>

  <text start="438.92" dur="4.5">quarter million dollars to win and that</text>
  <text start="441.95" dur="3.24">seems like a lot of money I don&amp;#39;t maybe</text>
  <text start="443.42" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s not in politics I don&amp;#39;t really know</text>
  <text start="445.19" dur="4.02">much about fundraising and politics I</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="4.11">just know that if I get in I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="3.24">basically vote 100 percent Trump and</text>
  <text start="451.22" dur="4.38">then I&amp;#39;m gonna YouTube about it later</text>
  <text start="452.45" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;m gonna bring transparency to the</text>
  <text start="455.6" dur="10.92">halls of Congress and they&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="457.7" dur="10.92">gonna like me there I did not see the</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="3.66">livestream of Laura Loomer on red pill I</text>
  <text start="468.62" dur="7.23">heard something about it though that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.18" dur="11.48">cool yeah I do believe that Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="475.85" dur="5.81">is fake Magra Trojan Magra honestly</text>
  <text start="484.68" dur="6.519">hmm so what do you guys think of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.759" dur="2.31">happening right now with the impeachment</text>
  <text start="491.199" dur="4.71">nonsense</text>
  <text start="492.069" dur="6.301">and as for Cummings being McCain I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="495.909" dur="4.44">know but I certainly saw that comment</text>
  <text start="498.37" dur="4.919">from McCain&amp;#39;s daughter where she said</text>
  <text start="500.349" dur="5.551">you can&amp;#39;t kill my father again right</text>
  <text start="503.289" dur="4.47">that was very interesting right so</text>
  <text start="505.9" dur="4.019">that&amp;#39;s the second slip up or Freudian</text>
  <text start="507.759" dur="6.421">slip that we&amp;#39;ve had in the mainstream we</text>
  <text start="509.919" dur="6.3">of course we had Kasich Kasich basically</text>
  <text start="514.18" dur="4.469">slip up on live CNN and say that they</text>
  <text start="516.219" dur="9.06">had put McCain to death so that was a</text>
  <text start="518.649" dur="8.55">very strange coincidence as well Alex</text>
  <text start="525.279" dur="5.521">Jones is the reason I became a truther</text>
  <text start="527.199" dur="6.51">as well Roberto honestly it&amp;#39;s very sad</text>
  <text start="530.8" dur="5.58">that that we&amp;#39;ve seen him fall from sort</text>
  <text start="533.709" dur="5.341">of the leadership position to being this</text>
  <text start="536.38" dur="6.03">sort of a known troll shill under the</text>
  <text start="539.05" dur="5.64">bridge and to end to be on the receiving</text>
  <text start="542.41" dur="5.729">end of the kind of like vitriol that</text>
  <text start="544.69" dur="6.06">he&amp;#39;s capable of like I woke up and he</text>
  <text start="548.139" dur="4.26">had attacked me the way he did said some</text>
  <text start="550.75" dur="6.24">vile things about me called me a bunch</text>
  <text start="552.399" dur="5.94">of names like just stupid things it gave</text>
  <text start="556.99" dur="2.76">me some good material too you know I got</text>
  <text start="558.339" dur="3.211">a best-selling book out of it but gave</text>
  <text start="559.75" dur="3.389">me some good material saying he cried in</text>
  <text start="561.55" dur="4.17">front of his kids over breakfast things</text>
  <text start="563.139" dur="4.5">like that after watching my video but</text>
  <text start="565.72" dur="4.59">you&amp;#39;re just things like that it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="567.639" dur="4.921">it&amp;#39;s just kind of immature it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="570.31" dur="4.95">more attacking my person my character</text>
  <text start="572.56" dur="4.649">rather than attacking my argument it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.26" dur="4.35">the sort of actions of someone who was</text>
  <text start="577.209" dur="4.471">triggered and it was lashing out in fear</text>
  <text start="579.61" dur="4.11">and I don&amp;#39;t know if you guys have all</text>
  <text start="581.68" dur="4.529">been around since I I did that initial</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="5.22">video where Alex Jones sort of responded</text>
  <text start="586.209" dur="4.411">to it but who would have thought Alex</text>
  <text start="588.94" dur="5.25">Jones would have ever responded to</text>
  <text start="590.62" dur="5.76">someone like me right I would have just</text>
  <text start="594.19" dur="4.05">thought I was just a no one but when he</text>
  <text start="596.38" dur="4.29">did I saw fear and I realized we can</text>
  <text start="598.24" dur="4.74">take him down to you know we can expose</text>
  <text start="600.67" dur="4.26">him for being just another Fox News just</text>
  <text start="602.98" dur="3.69">another controlled opposition he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="604.93" dur="4.38">the next layer deep once you stop</text>
  <text start="606.67" dur="5.55">trusting Fox you go to oen or you go to</text>
  <text start="609.31" dur="4.44">Fox News or something like that you know</text>
  <text start="612.22" dur="3.92">they have different levels set up to</text>
  <text start="613.75" dur="4.41">capture like 90% of people</text>
  <text start="616.14" dur="3.55">eventually you get through to someone</text>
  <text start="618.16" dur="4.32">who&amp;#39;s truly independent that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="619.69" dur="4.5">censored out the wazoo truly and I know</text>
  <text start="622.48" dur="4.2">they say alex is the most censored guy</text>
  <text start="624.19" dur="4.41">on the internet and stuff but he&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="626.68" dur="5.19">tripled his audience basically since</text>
  <text start="628.6" dur="5.88">then right so we have to say that as</text>
  <text start="631.87" dur="5.13">well he he didn&amp;#39;t really get censored he</text>
  <text start="634.48" dur="4.41">got sort of a Streisand effect from the</text>
  <text start="637" dur="5.7">mainstream media controlled tries and</text>
  <text start="638.89" dur="5.13">effect whereas at least I&amp;#39;m probably the</text>
  <text start="642.7" dur="4.17">most censored man that&amp;#39;s still on</text>
  <text start="644.02" dur="6.71">YouTube because I&amp;#39;ve been frozen hard</text>
  <text start="646.87" dur="6.24">for a year straight so I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="650.73" dur="4.81">the difference is that they banned him</text>

  <text start="834.94" dur="4.56">very much sort of stubborn so I found</text>
  <text start="837.64" dur="3.75">you have to definitely have to ask her</text>
  <text start="839.5" dur="3.3">to do anything because if you&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="841.39" dur="4.89">take something away from her for example</text>
  <text start="842.8" dur="4.83">she gets mad so you have to ask her</text>
  <text start="846.28" dur="3.6">nicely and then she&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="847.63" dur="3.54">cooperative she knows how to say please</text>
  <text start="849.88" dur="2.58">things like that</text>
  <text start="851.17" dur="3.57">maybe I&amp;#39;ll get her in here in a little</text>
  <text start="852.46" dur="4.89">bit is she&amp;#39;s just really learning</text>
  <text start="854.74" dur="5.04">quickly too now she has shoes that</text>

  <text start="862.6" dur="6.17">she just runs in circles in squeak</text>
  <text start="864.37" dur="7.05">squeak-squeak it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s good to be a dad</text>
  <text start="868.77" dur="4.99">though Clinton is probably looking</text>
  <text start="871.42" dur="4.86">forward to dying versus what&amp;#39;s facing</text>

  <text start="876.28" dur="5.76">he&amp;#39;s committed the acts of child rape</text>
  <text start="878.73" dur="3.82">things like that so I imagine that Bill</text>

  <text start="890.92" dur="4.65">that the justice phase takes we may not</text>

  <text start="1053.6" dur="3.14">Sparrow was looking rough these days</text>
  <text start="1057.22" dur="5.23">Johnny Depp and he&amp;#39;s been around for a</text>
  <text start="1060.799" dur="4.531">long time you ever think like he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1062.45" dur="4.92">in DC or not DC I in Hollywood for a</text>
  <text start="1065.33" dur="5.67">long time I remember seeing him in like</text>
  <text start="1067.37" dur="5.429">the early Freddy Krueger movies so you</text>
  <text start="1071" dur="4.559">know he&amp;#39;s been around for a long time</text>
  <text start="1072.799" dur="4.771">and it&amp;#39;s almost as though any movie or</text>
  <text start="1075.559" dur="4.62">TV show that I try to watch these days</text>
  <text start="1077.57" dur="5.719">and I don&amp;#39;t watch a lot but anything</text>
  <text start="1080.179" dur="5.761">that I do try to watch seems to be about</text>
  <text start="1083.289" dur="6.071">like exploiting or destroying children</text>
  <text start="1085.94" dur="5.459">like watch a TV show called stranger</text>
  <text start="1089.36" dur="5.46">things it was about impaled for stuff it</text>
  <text start="1091.399" dur="5.25">was about exploiting children monsters</text>
  <text start="1094.82" dur="4.469">metaphor you know all that other stuff</text>
  <text start="1096.649" dur="4.65">and then all of these different TV shows</text>
  <text start="1099.289" dur="3.721">even back if I go to like the eighties</text>
  <text start="1101.299" dur="3.931">and stuff I tried to watch that show</text>
  <text start="1103.01" dur="4.529">little monsters I think it was called</text>
  <text start="1105.23" dur="4.59">and it&amp;#39;s basically monsters Inc it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1107.539" dur="4.561">about exploiting children and they they</text>
  <text start="1109.82" dur="4.02">the monster takes the child under the</text>
  <text start="1112.1" dur="3.93">bed into the monster world and then</text>
  <text start="1113.84" dur="4.05">eventually they end up with a room of</text>
  <text start="1116.03" dur="3.6">monsters trying to torture a small baby</text>
  <text start="1117.89" dur="4.169">and convincing the child that it&amp;#39;s fun</text>
  <text start="1119.63" dur="4.019">to do it and join in and the child</text>
  <text start="1122.059" dur="5.581">rebels and doesn&amp;#39;t want to hurt the baby</text>
  <text start="1123.649" dur="5.371">so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a weird sort of trend in</text>
  <text start="1127.64" dur="3.11">Hollywood if you really look for the</text>
  <text start="1129.02" dur="4.62">metaphor if you look for the symbolism</text>
  <text start="1130.75" dur="4.33">there&amp;#39;s a lot of that it&amp;#39;s almost as</text>
  <text start="1133.64" dur="4.8">though you can&amp;#39;t watch anything anymore</text>
  <text start="1135.08" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s the symbolism is everywhere and s.q</text>
  <text start="1138.44" dur="3.349">said the symbolism will be their</text>
  <text start="1139.76" dur="2.029">downfall</text>
  <text start="1144.69" dur="5.14">my great regret is that these folks will</text>
  <text start="1147.49" dur="3.93">who were already very very very old as</text>
  <text start="1149.83" dur="3.36">that they probably will die before they</text>

  <text start="1157.57" dur="7.47">jail for like the 6 to 12 months she has</text>
  <text start="1159.88" dur="7.59">left I mean probably not and she&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="3658.85" dur="4.95">think that could change the game in a</text>
  <text start="3661.34" dur="6.48">way because no one&amp;#39;s doing that no one</text>
  <text start="3663.8" dur="6.15">has that level of transparency I think</text>
