  <text start="29.669" dur="5.011">responsible for ground operations in</text>
  <text start="32.04" dur="5.13">Baghdad which is sort of a symbolic</text>
  <text start="34.68" dur="4.83">ending of major combat operations in</text>

  <text start="45.66" dur="5.219">Moore is suing all of his accusers okay</text>
  <text start="48.78" dur="5.34">this is a big league politics article</text>
  <text start="50.879" dur="5.131">and it says last year special election</text>
  <text start="54.12" dur="4.919">to find a replacement for Alabama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="5.189">junior senator was rocked when judge Roy</text>
  <text start="59.039" dur="4.29">Moore who was poised to win the seat was</text>
  <text start="61.199" dur="5.251">hounded by rumors of sexual assault from</text>
  <text start="63.329" dur="5.011">three women those claims were so</text>
  <text start="66.45" dur="4.17">damaging to his reputation that Doug</text>
  <text start="68.34" dur="4.26">Jones and unknown Democrat candidate was</text>
  <text start="70.62" dur="4.17">able to beat more on election night and</text>
  <text start="72.6" dur="4.589">it was definitely a lot of if he stuff</text>
  <text start="74.79" dur="6.41">going on there and some of us in the Q</text>
  <text start="77.189" dur="6.39">community kind of wondered if maybe</text>
  <text start="81.2" dur="5.11">Trump had allowed that election to be</text>
  <text start="83.579" dur="5.07">cheated in order to gain evidence on how</text>
  <text start="86.31" dur="7.05">the Democrats were rigging elections and</text>
  <text start="88.649" dur="6.93">stuff that said everybody had kind of</text>
  <text start="93.36" dur="3.96">heard it was like 10 women or some large</text>
  <text start="95.579" dur="5.4">number of women apparently it was only</text>
  <text start="97.32" dur="5.43">three and I remember some of the</text>
  <text start="100.979" dur="3.451">inconsistencies in those stories like</text>
  <text start="102.75" dur="3.24">the woman that says she worked at the</text>
  <text start="104.43" dur="4.11">restaurant that didn&amp;#39;t really work in</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="4.26">that restaurant says he raped her behind</text>
  <text start="108.54" dur="3.42">the restaurant but it was actually on</text>
  <text start="110.25" dur="4.409">the side of the dumpsters were just all</text>
  <text start="111.96" dur="5.28">of these you know she kind of smudged</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="4.46">the yearbook as well the signature the</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="5.1">yearbook woman you&amp;#39;ll remember her</text>
  <text start="119.119" dur="5.92">anyway that that&amp;#39;s sorry about the noise</text>
  <text start="122.34" dur="5.279">in the background I live in the downtown</text>
  <text start="125.039" dur="6.741">of a small town so sometimes there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="8.221">noise but not always and also breaking</text>
  <text start="131.78" dur="8.41">Mueller warns he may subpoena drop which</text>
  <text start="135.84" dur="8.31">is this is a kind of more hostile turn</text>
  <text start="140.19" dur="5.67">move of desperation I guess it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="144.15" dur="4.05">seem like he really has much to go on</text>
  <text start="145.86" dur="4.62">he&amp;#39;s just kind of grasping at straws and</text>
  <text start="148.2" dur="4.86">it seems like their best bet is to try</text>
  <text start="150.48" dur="4.339">to process crime and catch Trump and</text>
  <text start="153.06" dur="4.55">something when he slipped up and said</text>
  <text start="154.819" dur="5.021">the wrong thing the FBI and therefore</text>
  <text start="157.61" dur="4.87">lied to the FBI and something like that</text>
  <text start="159.84" dur="4.59">I mean if you ask people the same thing</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="3.18">twice over a period of months or three</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="3.24">or four times over a period of months</text>
  <text start="165.66" dur="3.78">sometimes a story might change because</text>
  <text start="167.67" dur="6.12">it&amp;#39;s just how people work I mean our</text>
  <text start="169.44" dur="6.18">brains just this is why eyewitnesses are</text>
  <text start="173.79" dur="4.62">extremely unreliable like they can</text>
  <text start="175.62" dur="6.69">completely remember things later on in</text>
  <text start="178.41" dur="7.14">court and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s actually a problem</text>
  <text start="182.31" dur="5.58">Kanye again Kanye&amp;#39;s back in the news he</text>
  <text start="185.55" dur="5.519">tells his fans how Republicans freed the</text>
  <text start="187.89" dur="4.679">slaves liberals are going crazy and</text>
  <text start="191.069" dur="3.601">since then he&amp;#39;s done even more stuff</text>
  <text start="192.569" dur="5.101">there&amp;#39;s a lot of excitement coming out</text>
  <text start="194.67" dur="6.66">with Kanye he&amp;#39;s been seen again with</text>
  <text start="197.67" dur="7.44">Candace Owens and other conservatives he</text>
  <text start="201.33" dur="5.61">is he is just sort of directly going</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="7.83">into the Deathstar to blow it out sort</text>
  <text start="206.94" dur="7.44">of in a Star Wars example right like</text>
  <text start="212.94" dur="2.91">right at the end when Luke in the</text>
  <text start="214.38" dur="4.29">original Star Wars when Luke goes into</text>
  <text start="215.85" dur="4.53">the Death Star and blows it up or hits</text>
  <text start="218.67" dur="4.56">the hits the right sweet spot I think</text>
  <text start="220.38" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s exactly what um what is happening</text>
  <text start="223.23" dur="4.77">here with Kanye in the Democrat</text>
  <text start="225.51" dur="4.47">thought-control he&amp;#39;s just kind of</text>
  <text start="228" dur="5.37">setting off nukes from the inside it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="229.98" dur="8.28">it&amp;#39;s great I can&amp;#39;t even express how</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="7.41">bright that is for the long-term game US</text>
  <text start="238.26" dur="4.849">officials say that Israel is preparing</text>
  <text start="240.78" dur="5.4">for war with Iran and basically</text>
  <text start="243.109" dur="4.991">Netanyahu is laying it out to try to</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="6.089">bring us into this war he even did his</text>
  <text start="248.1" dur="6.09">little presentation in English I saw</text>
  <text start="252.269" dur="5.371">some funny remakes of his presentation</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="5.549">where it showed that the amount of land</text>
  <text start="257.64" dur="3.93">Palestine controlled versus Israel in</text>
  <text start="259.739" dur="4.201">four separate slides and it just gets</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="4.71">way way way bigger for Israel and just</text>
  <text start="263.94" dur="5.07">like no Palestinian side left I know</text>
  <text start="266.28" dur="4.58">that there is some immorality on the</text>
  <text start="269.01" dur="3.83">Israeli side</text>
  <text start="270.86" dur="3.619">of the Palestinian verses or anything I</text>
  <text start="272.84" dur="5.069">think you can accept that and still be</text>
  <text start="274.479" dur="7.331">more for Israel than 3 billion Muslims</text>
  <text start="277.909" dur="5.1">that want to kill us all that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="5.819">my position on it like I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="283.009" dur="8.97">pro-israel I&amp;#39;m just anti Islam from a</text>
  <text start="287.629" dur="8.871">sense of self-preservation it&amp;#39;s just my</text>
  <text start="291.979" dur="7.981">healthy culture so congressman is</text>
  <text start="296.5" dur="5.919">introducing a make sanctuary cities pay</text>
  <text start="299.96" dur="4.109">for the wall act this is pretty exciting</text>
  <text start="302.419" dur="3.661">I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s gonna actually get</text>
  <text start="304.069" dur="4.141">anywhere but basically he wants to</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="4.709">defund sanctuary cities he says there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.21" dur="5.549">over 300 of them and then put that money</text>
  <text start="310.789" dur="4.53">into the wall and solve major issues all</text>
  <text start="313.759" dur="4.831">over the place it&amp;#39;s a really smart idea</text>
  <text start="315.319" dur="7.38">very pragmatic and businesslike I doubt</text>
  <text start="318.59" dur="8.49">it will actually pass President Trump</text>
  <text start="322.699" dur="6.511">reportedly promised Rand Paul Senator</text>
  <text start="327.08" dur="3.54">Rand Paul in a private conversation that</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="4.139">he was planning on pulling troops out of</text>
  <text start="330.62" dur="6.719">Afghanistan and this is from the</text>
  <text start="333.349" dur="5.43">Washington Post and getting the hell out</text>
  <text start="337.339" dur="5.94">of Afghanistan is kind of how they</text>
  <text start="338.779" dur="9.661">titled it so that that&amp;#39;s more toward the</text>
  <text start="343.279" dur="8.04">the benefit of having two wonderful dogs</text>
  <text start="348.44" dur="5.25">that I absolutely love and adore is that</text>

  <text start="353.69" dur="6.689">they sound the alarms hell is here all</text>
  <text start="358.039" dur="5.16">things are ending we have to to mount</text>
  <text start="360.379" dur="5.22">the defense he they&amp;#39;re all over it so</text>
  <text start="363.199" dur="4.201">that&amp;#39;s what that was and I&amp;#39;m just gonna</text>
  <text start="365.599" dur="6.81">combine these videos together so you</text>
  <text start="367.4" dur="7.319">guys can skip all the loud noises I was</text>
  <text start="372.409" dur="5.19">kind of saying how that&amp;#39;s Trump pulling</text>
  <text start="374.719" dur="6.271">out that&amp;#39;s a clear pattern you know Iran</text>
  <text start="377.599" dur="5.641">Afghanistan attempted Syria pulling</text>
  <text start="380.99" dur="4.829">troops home that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s great great</text>
  <text start="383.24" dur="4.649">news it&amp;#39;s sort of oh I&amp;#39;m hoping that his</text>
  <text start="385.819" dur="4.141">thought on this is the walk softly carry</text>
  <text start="387.889" dur="3.99">a big stick approach and avoid foreign</text>
  <text start="389.96" dur="4.199">entanglements that&amp;#39;s kind of how we used</text>
  <text start="391.879" dur="4.111">to be here in the u.s. we didn&amp;#39;t start</text>
  <text start="394.159" dur="4.931">problems we didn&amp;#39;t try to police the</text>
  <text start="395.99" dur="5.42">world we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="399.09" dur="4.66">we didn&amp;#39;t go looking for issues</text>
  <text start="401.41" dur="4.62">elsewhere we sort of just kept to</text>
  <text start="403.75" dur="6.15">ourselves kept a strong perimeter fence</text>
  <text start="406.03" dur="6.45">against a danger and you just kind of</text>
  <text start="409.9" dur="4.47">dominated the world economy that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="412.48" dur="4.92">power of the gold standard and a little</text>
  <text start="414.37" dur="5.49">bit of freedom and you know in the</text>
  <text start="417.4" dur="4.86">beginning as a small government I like</text>
  <text start="419.86" dur="4.08">to tell this a lot but you used to be</text>
  <text start="422.26" dur="4.08">that you could go your entire life and</text>

  <text start="460.2" dur="6.93">don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s a citizen but he was</text>
  <text start="464.02" dur="5.91">sowing heroin into puppies bellies</text>

  <text start="483.79" dur="3.23">think I need to make comment on that</text>
