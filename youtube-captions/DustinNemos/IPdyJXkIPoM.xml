  <text start="13.549" dur="5.771">welcome back my friends this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="16.32" dur="7.41">Deimos and I&amp;#39;m going to recap the daily</text>
  <text start="19.32" dur="5.939">Magga update for you guys so real</text>
  <text start="23.73" dur="3.029">briefly for those who may not be aware</text>
  <text start="25.259" dur="3.66">you know I&amp;#39;m getting some new people on</text>
  <text start="26.759" dur="4.831">the channel I&amp;#39;m still trying to get back</text>
  <text start="28.919" dur="6.421">all of the people that lost me when they</text>
  <text start="31.59" dur="6.78">deleted my channel the other day I tried</text>
  <text start="35.34" dur="5.25">to recap in condense many hours of</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="4.14">research a day because I&amp;#39;m already doing</text>
  <text start="40.59" dur="3.66">this stuff anyway I&amp;#39;m already kind of</text>
  <text start="42.51" dur="3.68">hyper obsessed with what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="44.25" dur="5.61">the world politics and behind-the-scenes</text>
  <text start="46.19" dur="6.13">culture philosophy economics all of that</text>
  <text start="49.86" dur="3.87">in history these are my interests in</text>
  <text start="52.32" dur="2.19">there I&amp;#39;m kind of obsessed with them</text>
  <text start="53.73" dur="3.81">honestly</text>
  <text start="54.51" dur="4.62">and after the qa9 stuff started</text>
  <text start="57.54" dur="5.85">happening I decided to get into YouTube</text>
  <text start="59.13" dur="6.72">and I wanted to find a way to share what</text>
  <text start="63.39" dur="5.67">I do with others and this was my way to</text>
  <text start="65.85" dur="6.72">contribute so I go through many hours a</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="5.69">day every day almost every day so</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="5.58">there&amp;#39;s occasionally I miss a video but</text>
  <text start="74.75" dur="5.44">every day I try to condense all of that</text>
  <text start="78.15" dur="4.5">research down into a 10-15 minute video</text>
  <text start="80.19" dur="4.38">for you guys and when the qyn on stuff</text>
  <text start="82.65" dur="3.36">comes out which you know there&amp;#39;s weeks</text>
  <text start="84.57" dur="3.18">where he doesn&amp;#39;t say anything and then</text>
  <text start="86.01" dur="5.52">like the last couple days he starts</text>
  <text start="87.75" dur="8.549">dropping 40 posts so when that comes out</text>
  <text start="91.53" dur="6.54">I also try to do short primers as to</text>
  <text start="96.299" dur="3.871">what he&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s talking about what</text>
  <text start="98.07" dur="5.25">content he&amp;#39;s trying to direct us to look</text>
  <text start="100.17" dur="5.989">into or what the narrative is what what</text>
  <text start="103.32" dur="5.76">is the focus that we need to try to push</text>
  <text start="106.159" dur="4.75">and we&amp;#39;re gonna get into a queue video a</text>
  <text start="109.08" dur="3.48">little bit later as well he still seems</text>
  <text start="110.909" dur="5.07">to be dropping so I&amp;#39;m waiting and so I</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="4.89">can try to get them all at once every</text>
  <text start="115.979" dur="3.78">couple every 20 minutes I look and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="117.45" dur="5.88">got another one out so let&amp;#39;s jump in for</text>
  <text start="119.759" dur="5.821">what&amp;#39;s going on today there is a</text>
  <text start="123.33" dur="3.899">Breitbart article and this is very</text>
  <text start="125.58" dur="3.03">interesting very exciting okay if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="4.411">been following what&amp;#39;s going on you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="5.099">been seeing be censorship all across the</text>
  <text start="131.64" dur="6.2">Big Tex social media websites Facebook</text>
  <text start="133.709" dur="7.051">Twitter YouTube primarily but also</text>
  <text start="137.84" dur="4.75">YouTube&amp;#39;s parent company Google we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="140.76" dur="3.41">seen it across other platforms as well</text>
  <text start="142.59" dur="3.42">some of the little line</text>
  <text start="144.17" dur="4.24">little apps and things of that nature</text>
  <text start="146.01" dur="4.14">have started censoring as well there are</text>
  <text start="148.41" dur="7.29">dating sites that won&amp;#39;t let you show</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="7.89">guns it&amp;#39;s crazy so there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="155.7" dur="5.97">widespread concerted effort to censor</text>
  <text start="158.04" dur="6.54">and Trump has picked his twenty</text>
  <text start="161.67" dur="5.79">twenty-one of his campaign managers and</text>
  <text start="164.58" dur="6.24">the name is Brad parce qu&amp;#39;elle who</text>
  <text start="167.46" dur="8.55">interestingly put out a tweet saying two</text>
  <text start="170.82" dur="8.22">big tech that we are watching now Hugh</text>
  <text start="176.01" dur="5.67">also mentioned this in one of the post</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="5.19">today where he he referenced what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="181.68" dur="5.279">going on with the censorship and how</text>
  <text start="184.23" dur="4.47">they they were waiting on us to move and</text>
  <text start="186.959" dur="4.371">as soon as we push that into the the</text>
  <text start="188.7" dur="7.68">narrative Trump was able to act on it</text>
  <text start="191.33" dur="7.15">okay so it&amp;#39;s kind of hard to keep up and</text>
  <text start="196.38" dur="3.51">and and go back and forth from the</text>
  <text start="198.48" dur="3.42">mainstream narrative to the</text>
  <text start="199.89" dur="4.53">behind-the-scenes Q andand stuff but I</text>
  <text start="201.9" dur="4.89">try my best so this is a big deal this</text>
  <text start="204.42" dur="4.05">is very exciting because it means that</text>
  <text start="206.79" dur="4.05">we do actually have allies in the</text>
  <text start="208.47" dur="5.19">highest levels that are going to be</text>
  <text start="210.84" dur="5.67">pushing back against the censorship okay</text>
  <text start="213.66" dur="5.94">antitrust violations and lawsuits and</text>
  <text start="216.51" dur="5.43">breaking down these big companies it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="219.6" dur="6.33">just around the corner folks I really</text>
  <text start="221.94" dur="5.97">believe that interestingly in related</text>
  <text start="225.93" dur="3.72">news the petition for the internet Bill</text>
  <text start="227.91" dur="7.44">of Rights which I and others have been</text>
  <text start="229.65" dur="7.35">circulating all over social media it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.35" dur="2.82">been having issues with the website this</text>
  <text start="237" dur="5.84">is that this is the whitehouse.gov</text>
  <text start="238.17" dur="5.849">website names have been getting deleted</text>
  <text start="242.84" dur="5.59">okay</text>
  <text start="244.019" dur="6.931">very strange suspicious behavior so you</text>
  <text start="248.43" dur="4.98">may want to you know continue trying but</text>
  <text start="250.95" dur="4.2">you know basically we want to inject</text>
  <text start="253.41" dur="6.419">this into the conversation it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="6.329">have to be a whitehouse.gov petition but</text>
  <text start="259.829" dur="4.501">it does have to be a narrative focus</text>
  <text start="261.479" dur="4.231">like a talking point that is widespread</text>
  <text start="264.33" dur="3.06">through the country we have to get a lot</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="3.42">of people and generate a lot of buzz</text>
  <text start="267.39" dur="3.18">around this Internet Bill of Rights or</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="5.62">hashtag internet Bill of Rights if</text>
  <text start="270.57" dur="7.09">you&amp;#39;re on Twitter this is a big deal</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="4.83">obviously I warned about the potential</text>
  <text start="277.66" dur="3.87">for abuse when you&amp;#39;re creating a new law</text>
  <text start="279.58" dur="3.99">because obviously the government has a</text>
  <text start="281.53" dur="4.2">history of creating a law calling it the</text>
  <text start="283.57" dur="3.6">fluffy tear teddy bear we love puppies</text>
  <text start="285.73" dur="2.79">act and then in reality it kills</text>
  <text start="287.17" dur="3.51">children or somebody it&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="288.52" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s basically an example of what they</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="5.07">do you know that&amp;#39;s that that&amp;#39;s made-up</text>
  <text start="293.14" dur="4.53">hyperbole but it&amp;#39;s very realistic</text>
  <text start="295.75" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ll create something called like</text>
  <text start="297.67" dur="4.71">Obamacare or the Affordable Health Care</text>
  <text start="300.07" dur="5.7">Act and then it destroys health care and</text>
  <text start="302.38" dur="5.76">makes it unaffordable that is the the</text>
  <text start="305.77" dur="3.81">norm folks that is that is just a way</text>
  <text start="308.14" dur="3.36">that they would do it because they</text>
  <text start="309.58" dur="3.66">understand that most people will not</text>
  <text start="311.5" dur="5.22">look past the headline past the title</text>
  <text start="313.24" dur="5.91">and then they can they can push the fake</text>
  <text start="316.72" dur="4.17">lie instead of the truth if you actually</text>
  <text start="319.15" dur="6.06">read the bills you wouldn&amp;#39;t vote for</text>
  <text start="320.89" dur="8.55">many of them at all trust me now true</text>
  <text start="325.21" dur="7.11">pundit put it out that John McCain was</text>
  <text start="329.44" dur="4.2">expected to step down from the US Senate</text>
  <text start="332.32" dur="4.71">they actually said Senate officials</text>
  <text start="333.64" dur="4.86">confirm this but McCain&amp;#39;s wife tweeted</text>
  <text start="337.03" dur="2.88">out that he was not so I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="338.5" dur="5.04">what&amp;#39;s going on there there&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="339.91" dur="5.25">the rumor spreading around I have a hard</text>
  <text start="343.54" dur="4.26">time imagining that if he was going to</text>
  <text start="345.16" dur="4.68">do it she would she would still come out</text>
  <text start="347.8" dur="4.44">and like say that on Twitter that&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="349.84" dur="3.99">pretty stupid of her so I imagine that</text>
  <text start="352.24" dur="6.78">he did is just a rumor but we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="353.83" dur="7.23">time will tell now the NYPD and this is</text>
  <text start="359.02" dur="4.34">more culture than politics it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="361.06" dur="5.37">really a big deal politically but</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="5.38">culturally this is a really big deal the</text>
  <text start="366.43" dur="4.29">NYPD is basically prepared to arrest</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="4.35">Harvey Weinstein</text>
  <text start="370.72" dur="4.56">they are pending a decision from the</text>
  <text start="373.09" dur="5.64">Manhattan district attorney but they</text>
  <text start="375.28" dur="7.02">have enough evidence now for an arrests</text>
  <text start="378.73" dur="5.94">and prosecution on a felony sexual</text>
  <text start="382.3" dur="4.86">assault that&amp;#39;s great that&amp;#39;s wonderful</text>
  <text start="384.67" dur="5.67">news so maybe he won&amp;#39;t just get to go to</text>
  <text start="387.16" dur="4.74">a rehab right when these bad people do</text>
  <text start="390.34" dur="3.78">bad things and they get caught it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="391.9" dur="4.89">big scandal they go to rehab they drinks</text>
  <text start="394.12" dur="4.26">drink some some drinks they they relax</text>
  <text start="396.79" dur="2.25">by the pool for a few days and then</text>
  <text start="398.38" dur="3.98">everything below</text>
  <text start="399.04" dur="6">/ and then go back to doing bad things</text>
  <text start="402.36" dur="5.32">there is such a thing in this world as</text>
  <text start="405.04" dur="5.46">incentive and it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a pretty big</text>
  <text start="407.68" dur="5.16">motivator for people like hunger is a</text>
  <text start="410.5" dur="7.74">great motivator for getting off your ass</text>
  <text start="412.84" dur="8.58">and food stamps for example will destroy</text>
  <text start="418.24" dur="5.6">motivation to get off your ass now</text>
  <text start="421.42" dur="5.28">obviously it&amp;#39;s necessary in some cases</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="5.56">that&amp;#39;s just one example so in the case</text>
  <text start="426.7" dur="8.12">of powerful people abusing their power</text>
  <text start="429.4" dur="8.79">and forcing themselves on women well</text>
  <text start="434.82" dur="5.62">incentives they they can do it they can</text>
  <text start="438.19" dur="4.23">get away with it and no punishment but</text>
  <text start="440.44" dur="3.9">why not right what&amp;#39;s the incentive not</text>
  <text start="442.42" dur="4.62">to mean morality doesn&amp;#39;t come into it</text>
  <text start="444.34" dur="5.61">for most people morality is is an</text>
  <text start="447.04" dur="6.57">abstract you know second thought at best</text>
  <text start="449.95" dur="5.84">for most people so they&amp;#39;re not you know</text>
  <text start="453.61" dur="6.18">most of these sexual predators are not</text>
  <text start="455.79" dur="6.28">asking myself is this right while</text>
  <text start="459.79" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re doing it they&amp;#39;re not asking</text>
  <text start="462.07" dur="3.99">themselves they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="463.96" dur="2.7">into this thinking am I gonna hurt</text>
  <text start="466.06" dur="2.7">someone</text>
  <text start="466.66" dur="3.93">am i they&amp;#39;re not going at it from the</text>
  <text start="468.76" dur="4.88">empathetic approach they&amp;#39;re going at it</text>
  <text start="470.59" dur="6.24">from the can I get away with it approach</text>
  <text start="473.64" dur="4.84">so talking about incentives which is</text>
  <text start="476.83" dur="5.22">pretty relevant to pretty much every</text>
  <text start="478.48" dur="7.47">topic this could potentially if he goes</text>
  <text start="482.05" dur="5.94">down for it goes to prison would would</text>
  <text start="485.95" dur="4.08">send an incentive a negative incentive</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="3.84">for all of the other people in power</text>
  <text start="490.03" dur="4.1">that are doing negative and terrible</text>
  <text start="491.83" dur="4.62">things to women and children as well</text>
  <text start="494.13" dur="5.26">basically this says that you can be</text>
  <text start="496.45" dur="5.27">punished you should be afraid and fear</text>
  <text start="499.39" dur="4.53">is you know one of the greatest</text>
  <text start="501.72" dur="4.39">motivators and control mechanisms for</text>
  <text start="503.92" dur="4.29">people you know obviously those in power</text>
  <text start="506.11" dur="4.68">use it for evil all the time but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.21" dur="5.7">also necessary use it for good the</text>
  <text start="510.79" dur="5.46">problem as I see it is that evil people</text>
  <text start="513.91" dur="4.319">will use fear to control others but good</text>
  <text start="516.25" dur="4.25">people won&amp;#39;t use fear to control others</text>
  <text start="518.229" dur="4.981">and that&amp;#39;s not necessarily a good thing</text>
  <text start="520.5" dur="5.38">good people need to make bad people</text>
  <text start="523.21" dur="3.72">afraid or bad people will always be bad</text>
  <text start="525.88" dur="4.56">and they will</text>
  <text start="526.93" dur="7.86">they will keep doing bad things and that</text>
  <text start="530.44" dur="5.73">is the that is the incentive idea while</text>
  <text start="534.79" dur="4.59">good people have the attitude of</text>
  <text start="536.17" dur="5.78">turn-the-other-cheek bad people are</text>
  <text start="539.38" dur="5.34">gonna keep taking advantage of them</text>
  <text start="541.95" dur="3.37">while good people will get the idea of</text>
  <text start="544.72" dur="2.79">eye-for-an-eye</text>
  <text start="545.32" dur="6.57">if we can if we can kind of put that</text>
  <text start="547.51" dur="5.519">perspective on then quickly bad people</text>
  <text start="551.89" dur="6">start being afraid of doing bad things</text>
  <text start="553.029" dur="10.231">to them wolves don&amp;#39;t go after dogs they</text>
  <text start="557.89" dur="7.35">go after sheep dogs can fight back and</text>
  <text start="563.26" dur="3.63">whenever I&amp;#39;m talking about complicated</text>
  <text start="565.24" dur="5.789">psychology I like to boil it down and</text>
  <text start="566.89" dur="5.91">the amaz reductionist as possible I even</text>
  <text start="571.029" dur="3.451">like to to borrow from nature as much as</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="4.02">I can I&amp;#39;m definitely not a psychologist</text>
  <text start="574.48" dur="4.169">or anything but it helps me to</text>
  <text start="576.82" dur="5.97">understand things when I look at it from</text>
  <text start="578.649" dur="7.141">an animal perspective and the the wolves</text>
  <text start="582.79" dur="4.62">as the predator and the sheep as the the</text>
  <text start="585.79" dur="3.63">docile prey that won&amp;#39;t stand up for</text>
  <text start="587.41" dur="5.58">themselves and maybe not even aware of</text>
  <text start="589.42" dur="6.27">the predator being there and the dog</text>
  <text start="592.99" dur="4.349">that may not be as powerful as the wolf</text>
  <text start="595.69" dur="4.38">but definitely can fight back and is</text>
  <text start="597.339" dur="4.471">willing to fight back and you know at</text>
  <text start="600.07" dur="4.95">the very least will sound an alarm and</text>
  <text start="601.81" dur="5.61">bark really loud and try to fight well</text>
  <text start="605.02" dur="5.31">the wolf can probably take the dog out</text>
  <text start="607.42" dur="5.7">but the dog is gonna leave a mark</text>
  <text start="610.33" dur="4.56">hopefully and if the wolf keeps going</text>
  <text start="613.12" dur="3.36">and fighting dogs that wolf is</text>
  <text start="614.89" dur="3.75">eventually gonna run up against a dog</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="4.71">that manages to get a good hit and a</text>
  <text start="618.64" dur="4.29">good bite in whatever you want to say so</text>
  <text start="621.19" dur="3.36">that is what we have to consider when</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re dealing with bad people we have to</text>
  <text start="624.55" dur="3.9">we have to give the consequences for</text>
  <text start="626.89" dur="4.439">evil and if there are no consequences</text>

  <text start="1290.409" dur="5.311">was actually a possible thing sessions</text>
  <text start="1292.48" dur="5.64">kind of summed it up for you he said</text>
  <text start="1295.72" dur="5.42">it&amp;#39;s a settled matter because you can go</text>
  <text start="1298.12" dur="6.57">visit the graves of Jhansi Calhoun and</text>
  <text start="1301.14" dur="6.039">Abraham Lincoln major figures in the</text>

  <text start="1312.4" dur="3.99">the federal government kicked everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1313.96" dur="4.079">ass so now you have to listen to us this</text>
  <text start="1316.39" dur="3.149">is a settled matter it&amp;#39;s not like a</text>
  <text start="1318.039" dur="3.361">court case or anything it&amp;#39;s not like a</text>
  <text start="1319.539" dur="4.89">legal precedent or anything of that</text>

  <text start="1326.02" dur="7.71">basically what he&amp;#39;s saying here this is</text>
  <text start="1327.73" dur="7.8">a a power statement from a federal</text>
  <text start="1333.73" dur="2.52">government figure that the states have</text>
  <text start="1335.53" dur="3.42">no rights</text>
  <text start="1336.25" dur="4.169">basically federal federal law is the law</text>
  <text start="1338.95" dur="4.58">of the land it&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re saying and</text>
  <text start="1340.419" dur="5.49">even though it&amp;#39;s not the Constitution</text>
  <text start="1343.53" dur="3.73">balanced the state rights versus the</text>
  <text start="1345.909" dur="3.451">federal rights actually the states have</text>
  <text start="1347.26" dur="4.049">more authority within the state and the</text>
  <text start="1349.36" dur="3.84">federal government did and that was part</text>
  <text start="1351.309" dur="3.031">of that whole balance of power so that</text>
  <text start="1353.2" dur="3.63">the federal government didn&amp;#39;t become</text>
  <text start="1354.34" dur="6.99">this monster of abuse and and</text>
  <text start="1356.83" dur="8.52">bureaucracy and everything else that we</text>
  <text start="1361.33" dur="5.88">see from the federal government so but</text>
  <text start="1365.35" dur="3.9">it is a settled matter he&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="1367.21" dur="4.29">right in the fact that they just will</text>
  <text start="1369.25" dur="3.6">take it you know they may not be legally</text>
  <text start="1371.5" dur="2.52">in the right to do so but the</text>
  <text start="1372.85" dur="3.15">Constitution has been dead for a long</text>
  <text start="1374.02" dur="4.2">time so what do they care</text>
  <text start="1376" dur="3.45">federal laws whatever they say it is and</text>
  <text start="1378.22" dur="5.15">you&amp;#39;re gonna do whatever they tell you</text>

  <text start="1388.15" dur="5.759">kind of this kind of power statement</text>
  <text start="1391.63" dur="6">about state rights I believe state</text>
  <text start="1393.909" dur="8.341">rights are a major counterbalance to</text>
  <text start="1397.63" dur="6.63">federal power and also this is</text>
  <text start="1402.25" dur="4.47">interesting in the wider world of</text>

  <text start="1551.94" dur="3.33">things that Trump has done and my</text>

  <text start="1595.45" dur="3.87">worth mentioning it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1597.059" dur="6.221">for those who have following the climate</text>
  <text start="1599.32" dur="5.25">change debate and you know if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1603.28" dur="2.79">already caught up on climate change</text>
  <text start="1604.57" dur="4.02">debate a couple things to look into</text>
  <text start="1606.07" dur="5.04">would be like the Climategate emails</text>
  <text start="1608.59" dur="7.17">where the they were caught manufacturing</text>
  <text start="1611.11" dur="6.21">data in order to push that agenda hiding</text>
  <text start="1615.76" dur="2.61">the decline because the world was</text>
  <text start="1617.32" dur="2.82">actually getting cooler and they were</text>
  <text start="1618.37" dur="5.55">trying to hide that we just had a record</text>
  <text start="1620.14" dur="5.73">cold here if you actually look at the</text>
  <text start="1623.92" dur="4.11">record heat levels for the various</text>
  <text start="1625.87" dur="5.16">states and such you can go back like</text>
  <text start="1628.03" dur="4.61">decades and most of the the record heat</text>
  <text start="1631.03" dur="4.22">levels are in like the 50s or something</text>
  <text start="1632.64" dur="5.289">so we&amp;#39;re not actually getting any warmer</text>
  <text start="1635.25" dur="5.86">they&amp;#39;ll pick like one island that the</text>
  <text start="1637.929" dur="4.591">water levels going down or up or I guess</text>
  <text start="1641.11" dur="3.24">down</text>
  <text start="1642.52" dur="4.77">I don&amp;#39;t remember up or down whichever</text>
  <text start="1644.35" dur="4.709">and then they will use that to prove</text>
  <text start="1647.29" dur="5">their theory that the climate is</text>
  <text start="1649.059" dur="6.181">changing or something when in reality</text>
  <text start="1652.29" dur="6.13">things like Florida for example are</text>
  <text start="1655.24" dur="6">basically on a sandbar just barely above</text>
  <text start="1658.42" dur="5.31">water level most of the state and sand</text>
  <text start="1661.24" dur="7.8">washes away so you&amp;#39;re gonna lose land</text>
  <text start="1663.73" dur="7.14">mass for sandbars or for certain islands</text>
  <text start="1669.04" dur="4.26">things like that but they&amp;#39;ll use that as</text>
  <text start="1670.87" dur="5.309">global warming proof right we have</text>
  <text start="1673.3" dur="5.55">record ice caps and well one of the ice</text>
  <text start="1676.179" dur="4.201">caps actually has a lot of active</text>
  <text start="1678.85" dur="4.74">volcanoes under I think that&amp;#39;s causing</text>
  <text start="1680.38" dur="4.95">it to melt a lot but they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll use</text>
  <text start="1683.59" dur="4.86">storms they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll take the</text>
  <text start="1685.33" dur="4.77">hurricane from Houston and and Florida</text>
  <text start="1688.45" dur="6.03">and they&amp;#39;ll say that&amp;#39;s because of global</text>
  <text start="1690.1" dur="7.92">warming and basically just fear tactics</text>
  <text start="1694.48" dur="5.79">to push this fear alarmism and that is</text>
  <text start="1698.02" dur="4.89">kind of what the left us they play on</text>
  <text start="1700.27" dur="4.95">the emotions fear</text>
  <text start="1702.91" dur="4.23">and love they will take advantage of</text>
  <text start="1705.22" dur="6.39">people&amp;#39;s empathy they will show you</text>
  <text start="1707.14" dur="6.78">these stories of poor women and children</text>
  <text start="1711.61" dur="5.25">who are trying to flee from war-torn</text>

  <text start="1716.86" dur="3">in America what they won&amp;#39;t show you is</text>
  <text start="1718.63" dur="2.88">that most of the people that are coming</text>
  <text start="1719.86" dur="3.69">from these countries are not even coming</text>
  <text start="1721.51" dur="3.42">from a war-torn area and very few of</text>
  <text start="1723.55" dur="3.87">them are actually women or children most</text>

  <text start="1734.14" dur="3.2">have any problem saying that and they</text>
  <text start="1735.43" dur="5.46">can judge me if they want I don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1737.34" dur="6.64">we have a huge statistical difference in</text>
