  <text start="19.789" dur="3.371">welcome back this is testing with the</text>
  <text start="22.05" dur="3.96">Nemo&amp;#39;s news network</text>
  <text start="23.16" dur="5.129">today I have with me the founder and</text>
  <text start="26.01" dur="5.7">chairman of the Liberty Council mat</text>
  <text start="28.289" dur="5.7">Staver and he is working on the defense</text>
  <text start="31.71" dur="4.529">team of Sandra merits against Planned</text>
  <text start="33.989" dur="7.621">Parenthood Thank You mat Staver for</text>
  <text start="36.239" dur="6.66">being with us today so I know that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="41.61" dur="4.26">been covering the story for a little</text>
  <text start="42.899" dur="4.951">while but for those of us those of our</text>
  <text start="45.87" dur="4.59">viewers who haven&amp;#39;t heard of the story</text>
  <text start="47.85" dur="20.339">what can you tell them about this case</text>
  <text start="50.46" dur="20.4">and how you got involved with it and</text>
  <text start="68.189" dur="6.301">when those videos became public</text>
  <text start="70.86" dur="6.06">obviously there was a lot of there was a</text>
  <text start="74.49" dur="4.41">lot of stir around the country and even</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="4.47">around the world to see what was</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="4.259">happening in these abortion clinics and</text>
  <text start="81.39" dur="3.63">how Planned Parenthood was harvesting</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="4.14">and then selling baby body parts some of</text>
  <text start="85.02" dur="4.2">them were being sold on the open market</text>
  <text start="87.299" dur="5.551">through different organ procurement</text>
  <text start="89.22" dur="6.48">companies for up to $17,000 it was</text>
  <text start="92.85" dur="6.449">absolutely stunning and as a result</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="5.459">there was a legal action taken against</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="5.341">her by the Attorney General in</text>
  <text start="101.159" dur="5.28">California and also Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="104.64" dur="5.13">and so we were contacted by Sandra we</text>
  <text start="106.439" dur="8.401">read the case and we agreed to represent</text>
  <text start="109.77" dur="8.16">her if you go back the beginning we were</text>
  <text start="114.84" dur="6.15">recently able to show in the civil court</text>
  <text start="117.93" dur="5.16">a video and this judge has not allowed</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="4.05">hardly any videos only two videos have</text>
  <text start="123.09" dur="3.87">been shown so far in civil case in the</text>
  <text start="125.04" dur="5.76">criminal case it&amp;#39;s tradition</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="8.4">but back in 2000 that&amp;#39;s nineteen years</text>
  <text start="130.8" dur="6.39">ago ABC News 20/20 did a documentary and</text>
  <text start="135.36" dur="3.54">Chris Wallace was the main reporter and</text>
  <text start="137.19" dur="4.44">they had undercover reporters back then</text>
  <text start="138.9" dur="4.65">that did the same kind of thing that</text>
  <text start="141.63" dur="4.59">Sandra David did and that is in public</text>
  <text start="143.55" dur="5.13">places they had conversations in</text>
  <text start="146.22" dur="5.4">restaurants and other places but the one</text>
  <text start="148.68" dur="6.72">in 2020 was in a restaurant with a</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="6.83">doctor who admitted and was very proud</text>
  <text start="155.4" dur="5.46">of it that they were intentionally</text>
  <text start="158.45" dur="5.68">altering the abortion procedures to</text>
  <text start="160.86" dur="5.01">abort babies to harvest intact organs</text>
  <text start="164.13" dur="4.23">and then sell them on the open market</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="4.71">for high profit they were expecting that</text>
  <text start="168.36" dur="3.96">they might be able to bring in several</text>
  <text start="170.58" dur="4.07">million a year up to fifty thousand</text>
  <text start="172.32" dur="4.44">dollars a week and they could get to</text>
  <text start="174.65" dur="4.089">$2,500 nearly twenty years ago</text>
  <text start="176.76" dur="6.33">for different organs that they could</text>
  <text start="178.739" dur="6.171">sell and the documentary ended with the</text>
  <text start="183.09" dur="5.19">question this is happening it&amp;#39;s illegal</text>
  <text start="184.91" dur="5.92">and why is no one doing anything about</text>
  <text start="188.28" dur="4.709">this even Planned Parenthood CEO back</text>
  <text start="190.83" dur="4.74">then ended the video by saying whoever</text>
  <text start="192.989" dur="4.981">is involved in this ought to be</text>
  <text start="195.57" dur="4.139">prosecuted Louis plan apparently that</text>
  <text start="197.97" dur="3.84">was actually involved in it and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="199.709" dur="4.831">still involved in it that was one of the</text>
  <text start="201.81" dur="4.41">reasons why when they saw that video and</text>
  <text start="204.54" dur="4.89">they did their own research after</text>
  <text start="206.22" dur="5.34">several years concluded that this was</text>
  <text start="209.43" dur="5.16">still happening and that someone had to</text>
  <text start="211.56" dur="5.64">speak up and so David and Sandra after</text>
  <text start="214.59" dur="5.25">doing a lot of research begin these</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="7.61">undercover videos and those videos have</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="4.97">had a huge impact on this issue</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="4.15">so essentially what had happened back</text>
  <text start="227.58" dur="4.02">then was that Planned Parenthood had</text>
  <text start="229.38" dur="3.96">separated themselves seemingly from</text>
  <text start="231.6" dur="3.479">responsibility by claiming that they</text>
  <text start="233.34" dur="4.29">weren&amp;#39;t a part of that that they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="235.079" dur="10.861">guilty of it that it wasn&amp;#39;t them who was</text>
  <text start="237.63" dur="11.19">condoning it we&amp;#39;re actually doing this</text>
  <text start="245.94" dur="4.4">so what we found in these videos back in</text>
  <text start="248.82" dur="4.66">2013</text>
  <text start="250.34" dur="5.67">2015 is that Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="253.48" dur="4.409">affiliate these were medical directors</text>
  <text start="256.01" dur="4.14">and others who are working with</text>
  <text start="257.889" dur="5.351">organizations Mexican Express and other</text>
  <text start="260.15" dur="5.46">organ procurement companies and they</text>
  <text start="263.24" dur="5.31">would get an order list a regular basis</text>
  <text start="265.61" dur="5.04">from these stem or these organ</text>
  <text start="268.55" dur="3.81">procurement companies and the order</text>
  <text start="270.65" dur="4.23">would come from entities such as</text>
  <text start="272.36" dur="5.49">Stanford University and other research</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="5.4">facilities and you can go back then not</text>
  <text start="277.85" dur="4.59">long ago they&amp;#39;ve modified the website</text>
  <text start="280.28" dur="3.99">now since the lawsuit started but you</text>
  <text start="282.44" dur="4.35">can go back then on the stem Express</text>
  <text start="284.27" dur="4.92">website and you could order a specific</text>
  <text start="286.79" dur="5.73">body part you could order the</text>
  <text start="289.19" dur="5.07">gestational age of the baby the size of</text>
  <text start="292.52" dur="5.22">the heart kidneys lungs whatever it</text>
  <text start="294.26" dur="5.46">might be and that would then give you a</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="4.95">price list some of those were being sold</text>
  <text start="299.72" dur="4.74">for up to $17,000 then organizations</text>
  <text start="302.69" dur="4.229">like stem express would take that order</text>
  <text start="304.46" dur="3.9">form to these planned parent abortion</text>
  <text start="306.919" dur="3.81">clinics and they would presented to them</text>
  <text start="308.36" dur="3.839">and these abortionist would then alter</text>
  <text start="310.729" dur="4.531">the abortion procedure so that they</text>
  <text start="312.199" dur="6.381">could harvest intact lungs livers thymus</text>
  <text start="315.26" dur="7.05">kidneys brains and other body parts</text>
  <text start="318.58" dur="6.309">meaning that they also were told by the</text>
  <text start="322.31" dur="4.77">researches they don&amp;#39;t want any poison</text>
  <text start="324.889" dur="5.491">toward oxen or anything else injected</text>
  <text start="327.08" dur="5.97">into the baby because that would affect</text>
  <text start="330.38" dur="5.219">their research so consequently these</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="4.11">babies were literally tortured pulled</text>
  <text start="335.599" dur="4.051">apart alive in the womb some of those</text>
  <text start="337.16" dur="4.439">were breech births only the head was</text>
  <text start="339.65" dur="4.139">still in the womb while they were</text>
  <text start="341.599" dur="5.161">crushing above and below the four acts</text>
  <text start="343.789" dur="5.641">to take out impact body parts mothers</text>
  <text start="346.76" dur="5.31">were delivered alive are still beating</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="4.109">while they remove the hearts and kept</text>
  <text start="352.07" dur="3.9">those beating until they reached the</text>
  <text start="353.539" dur="5.94">research lab such as places like</text>
  <text start="355.97" dur="4.8">Stanford University and others while the</text>
  <text start="359.479" dur="4.111">baby was still alive they would</text>
  <text start="360.77" dur="6.72">literally slice down the middle of their</text>
  <text start="363.59" dur="6.93">face and extract an intact brain this is</text>
  <text start="367.49" dur="5.46">absolutely unbelievable if you were to</text>
  <text start="370.52" dur="4.619">hear the description of what was</text>
  <text start="372.95" dur="4.17">happening and I didn&amp;#39;t tell you the age</text>
  <text start="375.139" dur="4.59">of the person you would think that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.12" dur="4.47">the Holocaust in Nazi Germany but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="379.729" dur="2.321">in America and it&amp;#39;s still happening and</text>
  <text start="381.59" dur="2.829">it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="5.339">to these helpless defenseless children</text>
  <text start="384.419" dur="4.62">and so this is really what they wanted</text>
  <text start="387.389" dur="4.441">to show the world and that&amp;#39;s what these</text>
  <text start="389.039" dur="5.97">videos are about and as a result that a</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="5.309">Planned Parenthood has come after them</text>
  <text start="395.009" dur="3.78">with a multi-million dollar lawsuit to</text>
  <text start="397.139" dur="4.231">punish them and silence them to stop</text>
  <text start="398.789" dur="4.41">these videos and to try to send the</text>
  <text start="401.37" dur="5.039">message that no one else should do</text>
  <text start="403.199" dur="7.171">something like this information and the</text>
  <text start="406.409" dur="5.76">plan Planned Parenthood Attorney General</text>
  <text start="410.37" dur="3.269">in California did something on President</text>
  <text start="412.169" dur="3.15">never before in the history of</text>
  <text start="413.639" dur="4.051">California and that is indict</text>
  <text start="415.319" dur="5.011">journalists and even the Los Angeles</text>
  <text start="417.69" dur="4.5">Times editorial board blasted the</text>
  <text start="420.33" dur="4.589">Attorney General because they realize</text>
  <text start="422.19" dur="4.49">how this could actually seriously</text>
  <text start="424.919" dur="4.53">undermine journalistic efforts</text>
  <text start="426.68" dur="5.079">investigations and free speech that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.449" dur="8.37">what&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s over this trying</text>
  <text start="431.759" dur="9.861">to silence them and punish them wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="437.819" dur="6">it true that the law that enabled these</text>
  <text start="441.62" dur="4.419">investigative journalists to be indicted</text>
  <text start="443.819" dur="6.09">by the current Attorney General</text>
  <text start="446.039" dur="6.571">California wasn&amp;#39;t that law drawn up by</text>
  <text start="449.909" dur="11.79">Kamala Harris with the help of Planned</text>
  <text start="452.61" dur="11.94">Parenthood started all of this</text>
  <text start="461.699" dur="5.28">investigation and actually suppressed</text>
  <text start="464.55" dur="6.179">evidence in order to get a search</text>
  <text start="466.979" dur="6.06">warrant to seize the computers and the</text>
  <text start="470.729" dur="4.831">videos in David Clayton&amp;#39;s home and now</text>
  <text start="473.039" dur="4.641">we know that these search warrants with</text>
  <text start="475.56" dur="4.32">the affidavits were absolutely</text>
  <text start="477.68" dur="4.69">fraudulent because they didn&amp;#39;t contain</text>
  <text start="479.88" dur="4.409">the full information she didn&amp;#39;t create</text>
  <text start="482.37" dur="4.229">the law of the law was there and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="484.289" dur="4.35">what the law says in California in order</text>
  <text start="486.599" dur="5.401">to record someone you have both parties</text>
  <text start="488.639" dur="4.981">consent but there&amp;#39;s been significant</text>
  <text start="492" dur="4.319">exceptions to that and it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="493.62" dur="5.669">statute and one exception is if the</text>
  <text start="496.319" dur="5.09">conversation is within earshot of</text>
  <text start="499.289" dur="5.22">someone else it&amp;#39;s not a confidential</text>
  <text start="501.409" dur="4.781">communication if you&amp;#39;re in a room just</text>
  <text start="504.509" dur="3.81">you and someone else and it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="506.19" dur="3.93">privacy of your home or the privacy of</text>
  <text start="508.319" dur="3.531">your opposite no one else&amp;#39;s around all</text>
  <text start="510.12" dur="3.32">the doors are closed</text>
  <text start="511.85" dur="2.97">and you&amp;#39;re talking about sensitive</text>
  <text start="513.44" dur="3.599">information that&amp;#39;s our confidential</text>
  <text start="514.82" dur="4.29">communication you need both parties</text>
  <text start="517.039" dur="3.451">consent so if you&amp;#39;re at a restaurant and</text>
  <text start="519.11" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s people coming up to your table</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="4.17">and you&amp;#39;re in a conference and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522.95" dur="4.26">people all around and you carry on this</text>
  <text start="524.66" dur="4.32">conversation or even in one case you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="527.21" dur="3.18">in an elevator and the third party that</text>
  <text start="528.98" dur="3.12">you don&amp;#39;t know gets in the elevator and</text>
  <text start="530.39" dur="3.48">you continue talking about sensitive</text>
  <text start="532.1" dur="4.95">information that&amp;#39;s not confidential</text>
  <text start="533.87" dur="6.06">that&amp;#39;s within earshot have other people</text>
  <text start="537.05" dur="4.71">and so that exception applies because</text>
  <text start="539.93" dur="4.29">all of these recordings were in those</text>
  <text start="541.76" dur="5.64">kinds of places the other thing that</text>
  <text start="544.22" dur="5.85">applies is if you assume or have</text>
  <text start="547.4" dur="5.91">reasonable belief that the person</text>
  <text start="550.07" dur="6.33">recorded is engaging in or has engaged</text>
  <text start="553.31" dur="5.85">in the illegal conduct you have the</text>
  <text start="556.4" dur="5.37">ability to record without two-party</text>
  <text start="559.16" dur="4.85">consent that certainly applies here in</text>
  <text start="561.77" dur="4.95">fact if you go back to the 2000</text>
  <text start="564.01" dur="4.39">documentary by ABC News they even said</text>
  <text start="566.72" dur="3.66">what was happening back then which is</text>
  <text start="568.4" dur="4.74">the same thing is happening now and</text>
  <text start="570.38" dur="5.58">during the time of these recordings it</text>
  <text start="573.14" dur="4.44">is illegal and it is and in fact we</text>
  <text start="575.96" dur="4.2">actually have a video of one person</text>
  <text start="577.58" dur="7.11">saying that she would this is a Planned</text>
  <text start="580.16" dur="7.17">Parenthood doctor director that she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.69" dur="5.43">done about 30,000 abortions up to 200 in</text>
  <text start="587.33" dur="5.31">a week and she said she would take her</text>
  <text start="590.12" dur="6.39">forceps grab the baby in the womb pull</text>
  <text start="592.64" dur="9.21">the legs out breech and then as the late</text>
  <text start="596.51" dur="7.23">babies perfectly out then take forceps</text>
  <text start="601.85" dur="4.53">and crush above and crush below the</text>
  <text start="603.74" dur="6.42">thorax so she could take out intact</text>
  <text start="606.38" dur="6.9">hearts livers lungs kidneys and then</text>
  <text start="610.16" dur="5.07">eventually now the woman has been</text>
  <text start="613.28" dur="4.44">dilated that she pulled the baby up</text>
  <text start="615.23" dur="3.23">breech this baby&amp;#39;s alive with other kind</text>
  <text start="617.72" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s crushed</text>
  <text start="618.46" dur="4.81">then take out the what she calls the</text>
  <text start="621.32" dur="4.95">calvarium of the skull and then remove</text>
  <text start="623.27" dur="5.78">an intact brain all those one parts are</text>
  <text start="626.27" dur="6.45">then whisked off and Joe pack packages</text>
  <text start="629.05" dur="5.5">with FedEx trucks and other overnight</text>
  <text start="632.72" dur="5.84">delivery trucks and day delivery trucks</text>
  <text start="634.55" dur="4.01">while the woman is still</text>
  <text start="639.58" dur="54.19">- well it&amp;#39;s likely they hold almost as</text>
  <text start="691.52" dur="4.53">much power as Planned Parenthood and it</text>
  <text start="693.77" dur="5.93">seems that you know when it comes to the</text>
  <text start="696.05" dur="8.13">abortion industry it seems to be a large</text>
  <text start="699.7" dur="7.57">network and that is why they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="704.18" dur="6.15">really continue this illegal activity</text>
  <text start="707.27" dur="4.89">and pretty much without being held</text>
  <text start="710.33" dur="4.29">accountable at all and going back to</text>
  <text start="712.16" dur="3.92">when you were talking about the Stanford</text>
  <text start="714.62" dur="3.57">University and how are they were</text>
  <text start="716.08" dur="3.79">conducting research and all of that they</text>
  <text start="718.19" dur="4.56">were not the only ones they were I</text>
  <text start="719.87" dur="4.86">believe hundreds of universities</text>
  <text start="722.75" dur="7.65">hundreds of studies being done across</text>
  <text start="724.73" dur="9.06">the country I think I saw a article on</text>
  <text start="730.4" dur="5.25">this put out not that long ago but there</text>
  <text start="733.79" dur="5.16">was a lot of them but here&amp;#39;s the thing -</text>
  <text start="735.65" dur="6.72">is that when it comes to the</text>
  <text start="738.95" dur="4.74">universities one of those videos that</text>
  <text start="742.37" dur="4.26">was produced in the human capital</text>
  <text start="743.69" dur="5.19">project I watched all of them and in one</text>
  <text start="746.63" dur="4.47">of those videos the medical director who</text>
  <text start="748.88" dur="5.28">was from Arizona for Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="751.1" dur="7.64">she had said that she was also she also</text>
  <text start="754.16" dur="7.58">held a teaching position at USC a</text>

  <text start="769.75" dur="5.37">disease or baldness for example and in</text>
  <text start="773.26" dur="5.67">some cases they were taking scalps of</text>
  <text start="775.12" dur="8.31">babies and placing them on immunized</text>
  <text start="778.93" dur="7.08">nice to see if the hair follicles would</text>
  <text start="783.43" dur="4.8">grow so they could research both but</text>
  <text start="786.01" dur="5.94">they were being literally taken from</text>
  <text start="788.23" dur="6.06">these babies so it&amp;#39;s a lot of entities</text>
  <text start="791.95" dur="3.6">that were involved there&amp;#39;s universities</text>
  <text start="794.29" dur="3.03">that were involved they&amp;#39;re people that</text>
  <text start="795.55" dur="5.1">are wearing two hats they&amp;#39;re people that</text>
  <text start="797.32" dur="5.7">were working as medical directors for</text>
  <text start="800.65" dur="4.44">Planned Parenthood and they also were</text>
  <text start="803.02" dur="4.38">employed by the stem procurement</text>
  <text start="805.09" dur="4.11">companies there&amp;#39;s people that work for</text>
  <text start="807.4" dur="3.35">Planned Parenthood understand</text>
  <text start="809.2" dur="4.26">procurement companies they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="810.75" dur="4.72">teaching at universities and doing the</text>
  <text start="813.46" dur="4.8">research so one hand was actually</text>
  <text start="815.47" dur="5.1">helping the other hand and it was an</text>
  <text start="818.26" dur="4.56">incestuous is an incestuous relationship</text>
  <text start="820.57" dur="4.25">some of which was actually being funded</text>
  <text start="822.82" dur="5.09">by the federal government up until</text>
  <text start="824.82" dur="5.68">recently during the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="827.91" dur="5.1">of the Department of Health and Human</text>
  <text start="830.5" dur="6.18">Services has put a moratorium on new</text>
  <text start="833.01" dur="5.62">research funding that would be using</text>
  <text start="836.68" dur="4.17">these aborted babies but up until</text>
  <text start="838.63" dur="4.98">recently up until within the last year</text>
  <text start="840.85" dur="5.42">her federal government was funding this</text>
  <text start="843.61" dur="7.95">and these babies were literally being</text>
  <text start="846.27" dur="7.39">harvested so you can imagine here&amp;#39;s a 20</text>
  <text start="851.56" dur="3.75">or 30 women coming into an abortion</text>
  <text start="853.66" dur="3.33">clinic on a particular day and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="855.31" dur="3.06">this medical director or multiple</text>
  <text start="856.99" dur="4.68">different medical directors and they get</text>
  <text start="858.37" dur="6.11">the order form from say stem express</text>
  <text start="861.67" dur="6.27">that order form says that they want to</text>
  <text start="864.48" dur="7.84">lung them heart or kidney whatever it</text>
  <text start="867.94" dur="7.41">might be intact brain for this purchaser</text>
  <text start="872.32" dur="5.4">the end users of the research and so</text>
  <text start="875.35" dur="5.13">they look at the orders one for that day</text>
  <text start="877.72" dur="5.04">and they&amp;#39;re not trying to convince these</text>
  <text start="880.48" dur="4.41">women that there&amp;#39;s an alternative men</text>
  <text start="882.76" dur="5.55">wanting to process them through this</text>
  <text start="884.89" dur="5.88">assembly line and they give them a form</text>
  <text start="888.31" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s filled with legal mumbo-jumbo and</text>

  <text start="1109.05" dur="6.15">that Planned Parenthood is a benevolent</text>

  <text start="1115.2" dur="6.33">of planned parent when it comes to this</text>
  <text start="1117.72" dur="5.37">case though a judge is not supposed to</text>

  <text start="1230.54" dur="6.33">that is plantera had twice as opened up</text>

  <text start="1236.87" dur="4.32">weeks into the hearing we were able to</text>

  <text start="1256.429" dur="4.411">eventually getting the intact brain that</text>
  <text start="1259.34" dur="4.469">was able to be shown because Planned</text>

  <text start="1263.809" dur="4.281">but once they did we were able to show</text>
  <text start="1265.64" dur="6.36">that video and then also the 20/20</text>
  <text start="1268.09" dur="7.3">documentary back in 2000 by ABC News</text>
  <text start="1272" dur="4.79">that also was able to be shown and</text>
  <text start="1275.39" dur="5.4">that&amp;#39;s about an eight-minute video</text>
  <text start="1276.79" dur="8.47">showing the same exact thing 19 years</text>
  <text start="1280.79" dur="7.59">ago uncovered by ABC News doing the</text>

  <text start="1292.94" dur="6.089">the videos and believe there are 15 of</text>
  <text start="1295.669" dur="5.97">them when they be considered exculpatory</text>
  <text start="1299.029" dur="5.1">evidence and there is a law that would</text>
  <text start="1301.639" dur="5.25">require them if they are exculpatory</text>
  <text start="1304.129" dur="13.321">evidence then they would be required to</text>
  <text start="1306.889" dur="14.191">be brought forth right because you know</text>

  <text start="1333.08" dur="5.399">they had no basis for that and then we</text>
  <text start="1336.289" dur="4.11">can&amp;#39;t show the videos and we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1338.479" dur="6.361">actually bring in the experts that they</text>

  <text start="1344.84" dur="6.959">why it was why they believed it was</text>
  <text start="1347.96" dur="8.789">illegal and so all of it you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1351.799" dur="8.24">like being tried on trial for these</text>
  <text start="1356.749" dur="3.29">videos but you can&amp;#39;t show the videos</text>

  <text start="1393.229" dur="3.75">all these videos that could be shown</text>
  <text start="1394.879" dur="6.24">we&amp;#39;ve been able to show one that was</text>

  <text start="1401.119" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;ve mentioned earlier and then the</text>
  <text start="1402.59" dur="6.24">other one the 2000 documentary by ABC</text>
  <text start="1405.619" dur="5.25">News both of them are startling and I</text>
  <text start="1408.83" dur="3.87">think they&amp;#39;re very disturbing for</text>
  <text start="1410.869" dur="3.78">anybody who watches them to just realize</text>
  <text start="1412.7" dur="3.51">what is going on in these abortion</text>
  <text start="1414.649" dur="3.311">clinics and what&amp;#39;s happening to these</text>
  <text start="1416.21" dur="4.15">innocent children</text>
  <text start="1417.96" dur="4.77">and I think it would be important for</text>
  <text start="1420.36" dur="5.669">people to actually see what is happening</text>
  <text start="1422.73" dur="5.699">because at this point Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="1426.029" dur="5.461">has really pulled the veil over</text>
  <text start="1428.429" dur="6.781">everyone&amp;#39;s eyes making it seem that they</text>
  <text start="1431.49" dur="6.059">are an organization that is really</text>
  <text start="1435.21" dur="4.11">focused on women&amp;#39;s rights reproductive</text>
  <text start="1437.549" dur="4.26">rights but that&amp;#39;s not really what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1439.32" dur="6.229">about in these videos evidence that</text>
  <text start="1441.809" dur="10.86">clearly now would it be fair to say that</text>
  <text start="1445.549" dur="9.37">the reason why the videos weren&amp;#39;t wat</text>
  <text start="1452.669" dur="3.84">why the preliminary hearing the videos</text>
  <text start="1454.919" dur="4.35">could be shown in the preliminary</text>
  <text start="1456.509" dur="6.15">hearing in the criminal case is because</text>
  <text start="1459.269" dur="60.061">there wasn&amp;#39;t a jury because then the</text>
  <text start="1462.659" dur="59.581">jury would beam the influence and power</text>
  <text start="1519.33" dur="5.52">of Planned Parenthood what do you think</text>
  <text start="1522.24" dur="4.529">is the likelihood that a proper criminal</text>
  <text start="1524.85" dur="3.48">investigation against them will occur</text>
  <text start="1526.769" dur="4.311">outside of this case and what would be</text>
  <text start="1528.33" dur="2.75">the next step for that</text>
  <text start="1544.46" dur="80.23">to the videos the organ procurement</text>
  <text start="1615.929" dur="10.921">companies were prosecuted so then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1624.69" dur="4.739">likely because of their employment power</text>
  <text start="1626.85" dur="4.89">that even local prosecutors even if</text>
  <text start="1629.429" dur="4.95">there is a viable case they&amp;#39;re not most</text>
  <text start="1631.74" dur="5.569">will likely not pick it up because of</text>
  <text start="1634.379" dur="2.93">how dangerous that would be</text>
  <text start="1654.409" dur="7.781">yeah it&amp;#39;s really disheartening and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1658.95" dur="7.079">hoping too that maybe with this case if</text>
  <text start="1662.19" dur="6.57">it can be seen by enough people then the</text>
  <text start="1666.029" dur="5.311">public can be aware and then the more</text>
  <text start="1668.76" dur="4.7">the public becomes aware of it then I</text>
  <text start="1671.34" dur="4.5">it would be more likely that a</text>
  <text start="1673.46" dur="4.24">prosecutor someone can pick up this case</text>
  <text start="1675.84" dur="3.72">and say I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m going to go after them</text>
  <text start="1677.7" dur="20.07">I&amp;#39;m going to prosecute them for these</text>
  <text start="1679.56" dur="20.88">crimes that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s my hope - now the</text>

  <text start="1700.44" dur="4.35">and David daleiden had got involved in</text>
  <text start="1703.02" dur="3.42">this project because they wanted to</text>
  <text start="1704.79" dur="5.58">investigate these very serious</text>
  <text start="1706.44" dur="6.03">allegations of criminal activity and so</text>
  <text start="1710.37" dur="4.49">that&amp;#39;s why they started this project but</text>
  <text start="1712.47" dur="5.21">now they&amp;#39;re the ones who were on trial</text>
  <text start="1714.86" dur="5.86">now here&amp;#39;s the thing undercover</text>
  <text start="1717.68" dur="5.74">journalism going undercover is very</text>
  <text start="1720.72" dur="4.56">important in these situations because a</text>
  <text start="1723.42" dur="3.66">criminal especially a criminal that is</text>
  <text start="1725.28" dur="3.45">out in the public eye they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="1727.08" dur="4.65">to be very forthcoming about their</text>
  <text start="1728.73" dur="6.45">activities so that is why these tactics</text>
  <text start="1731.73" dur="7.89">are necessary if the jury rules against</text>
  <text start="1735.18" dur="8.51">Marren daleiden what does that say about</text>
  <text start="1739.62" dur="4.07">the future of investigative journalism</text>
  <text start="1765.17" dur="5.95">right and I think that&amp;#39;s a good point</text>
  <text start="1767.28" dur="7.17">too is that you know I think even if</text>
  <text start="1771.12" dur="5.31">someone is not pro life per se they can</text>
  <text start="1774.45" dur="5.19">still get behind this case because this</text>
  <text start="1776.43" dur="6.57">is about free speech because this is a</text>
  <text start="1779.64" dur="15.31">real threat you know - the first a</text>
  <text start="1783" dur="14.139">minute okay yes I understand</text>
  <text start="1794.95" dur="4.679">this yeah this is one of the most</text>
  <text start="1797.139" dur="3.78">important abortion cases in our history</text>
  <text start="1799.629" dur="4.05">and certainly and well being planned</text>
  <text start="1800.919" dur="5.19">parent but it&amp;#39;s also a huge implication</text>
  <text start="1803.679" dur="5.34">regarding free speech as well yes it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1806.109" dur="4.981">probably the biggest case going on right</text>
  <text start="1809.019" dur="4.77">now and I&amp;#39;m going to be covering this as</text>
  <text start="1811.09" dur="5.13">much as I possibly can and hopefully</text>
  <text start="1813.789" dur="4.35">more people will see this so because</text>
  <text start="1816.22" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s being completely covered right now</text>
  <text start="1818.139" dur="8.16">no one not a lot of people know about</text>
  <text start="1821.08" dur="7.26">this case unfortunately so thank you so</text>
  <text start="1826.299" dur="3.48">thank you so much mat Staver really</text>
