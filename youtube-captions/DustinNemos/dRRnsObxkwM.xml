  <text start="46.68" dur="4.879">discrimination goes in trying to find a</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="7.469">legal way to combat what is an</text>
  <text start="51.559" dur="7.421">incredible attempt to basically shut</text>

  <text start="110.1" dur="4.65">before I realized that there was a piece</text>
  <text start="112.829" dur="5.15">actually put out here by The Huffington</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="6.36">Post which I&amp;#39;ll show you right here</text>
  <text start="117.979" dur="5.111">which features yours truly as the main</text>
  <text start="121.11" dur="4.109">villain it&amp;#39;s talking about YouTube&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.09" dur="4.559">plan to rein in conspiracy theories is</text>
  <text start="125.219" dur="5.1">failing and of course this is the</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="4.441">Huffington Post and it&amp;#39;s by this person</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="4.051">jessalyn cook and I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="3.479">it for one minute before we get into the</text>
  <text start="134.37" dur="2.91">rest of the episode because it&amp;#39;ll give</text>
  <text start="135.569" dur="3.301">you a lot more context</text>
  <text start="137.28" dur="3.96">what I&amp;#39;m talking about when I say that</text>
  <text start="138.87" dur="4.82">we&amp;#39;re under attack but they wrote this</text>
  <text start="141.24" dur="7.32">piece and apparently I&amp;#39;m the main</text>
  <text start="143.69" dur="6.97">attraction here you can read it for</text>
  <text start="148.56" dur="3.72">yourself I&amp;#39;ll leave a link to it but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="150.66" dur="3.09">going to read the first part of it and</text>
  <text start="152.28" dur="3.69">let you kind of decide for yourself this</text>
  <text start="153.75" dur="3.93">six months ago under tremendous public</text>
  <text start="155.97" dur="4.32">pressure YouTube announced that it would</text>
  <text start="157.68" dur="5.25">tweak its algorithm to recommend fewer</text>
  <text start="160.29" dur="5.01">videos that could miss inform users in</text>
  <text start="162.93" dur="4.35">harmful ways it was a major step for a</text>
  <text start="165.3" dur="3.09">company that has spent years driving</text>
  <text start="167.28" dur="3.24">people toward increasingly</text>
  <text start="168.39" dur="4.23">sensationalist content including</text>
  <text start="170.52" dur="3.84">dangerous disinformation that would keep</text>
  <text start="172.62" dur="4.339">viewers glued to their screens for as</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="4.92">long as possible to maximize advertised</text>
  <text start="176.959" dur="4.691">advertising revenue so I&amp;#39;m gonna stop</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="4.53">right there first of all to the person</text>
  <text start="181.65" dur="5.88">who wrote this article you know good you</text>
  <text start="183.81" dur="6.66">know good luck you&amp;#39;re gonna be very much</text>
  <text start="187.53" dur="6.09">in on the losing side of this battle</text>
  <text start="190.47" dur="5.16">every time jessalyn and what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="193.62" dur="4.589">trying to say is is an argument for</text>
  <text start="195.63" dur="5.31">censorship and because you&amp;#39;re in one of</text>
  <text start="198.209" dur="4.831">the protected mainstream media positions</text>
  <text start="200.94" dur="4.23">you are the one who can be the arbiter</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="4.53">of what&amp;#39;s true and what&amp;#39;s good inside of</text>
  <text start="205.17" dur="5.629">our society even though I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="207.57" dur="6.18">speculate as to your religious you know</text>
  <text start="210.799" dur="5.171">identity but let me just say it would be</text>
  <text start="213.75" dur="5.85">hard-pressed for me to believe that</text>
  <text start="215.97" dur="4.92">there is a true woman of God or man or</text>
  <text start="219.6" dur="4.02">whatever you want to call yourself who</text>
  <text start="220.89" dur="4.68">knows these days right but a person of</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="4.17">God who could go out there and and</text>
  <text start="225.57" dur="5.22">really rail against the right for us to</text>
  <text start="227.79" dur="5.46">have the freedom of speech right it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="230.79" dur="3.6">hard sell for me but you guys let me</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="3.78">know what you think down in the comments</text>
  <text start="234.39" dur="4.65">that says the announcement in late</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="3.57">January triggered panic within YouTube</text>
  <text start="239.04" dur="3.09">sprawling network of conspiracy</text>
  <text start="240.6" dur="3.27">theorists so I guess I&amp;#39;m a conspiracy</text>
  <text start="242.13" dur="3.389">theorists this is the host of just</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="3.51">informed talk a channel with nearly a</text>
  <text start="245.519" dur="4.021">quarter million subscribers well thank</text>
  <text start="247.38" dur="4.169">you that is true we&amp;#39;re almost there</text>
  <text start="249.54" dur="3.9">you know hit subscribe if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="251.549" dur="3.991">already over on the main channel and hit</text>
  <text start="253.44" dur="5.88">subscribe here why not this is that</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="5.37">spreads cute on theories which are very</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="3.15">much validated through the QED proofs</text>
  <text start="260.91" dur="3.87">and all the other examples that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="262.47" dur="5.16">given where we&amp;#39;ve we basically been able</text>
  <text start="264.78" dur="4.53">to verify the fact that this is a high</text>
  <text start="267.63" dur="3.57">level of intelligence that&amp;#39;s being fed</text>
  <text start="269.31" dur="4.86">to us to disseminate around the fake</text>
  <text start="271.2" dur="5.4">news media which apparently as we all</text>
  <text start="274.17" dur="5.64">know the Huffington Post is a part of it</text>
  <text start="276.6" dur="5.97">says in baseless claims please give me</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="5.28">one example of a basis claims of her</text>
  <text start="282.57" dur="4.77">excuse me of a baseless claim please</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="4.89">one example jessalyn because in this</text>
  <text start="287.34" dur="4.32">whole article I don&amp;#39;t see one example of</text>
  <text start="289.98" dur="3.12">a baseless claim that I&amp;#39;ve made but</text>
  <text start="291.66" dur="5.49">apparently I make them all the time</text>
  <text start="293.1" dur="6.39">about Democratic politicians weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="297.15" dur="4.68">into February video the new measure was</text>
  <text start="299.49" dur="4.98">sure to instantly destroy the ability of</text>
  <text start="301.83" dur="4.35">pages like his to get traffic yes I did</text>
  <text start="304.47" dur="3.69">make a video back in February talking</text>
  <text start="306.18" dur="3.69">about the way that this algorithm was</text>
  <text start="308.16" dur="4.08">going to discriminate against my channel</text>
  <text start="309.87" dur="4.35">and guess what thanks to you guys they</text>
  <text start="312.24" dur="5.13">did finally follow through on that</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="5.97">promise and they were already doing it</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="5.04">anyway but I finally have figured out</text>
  <text start="320.19" dur="4.65">the reason why my channel I woke up one</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="3.54">morning and it was fully demonetized so</text>
  <text start="324.84" dur="3.6">you guys will remember on the main</text>
  <text start="325.95" dur="6.3">channel I posted a video talking about</text>
  <text start="328.44" dur="5.67">that exact thing and I was kind of like</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="5.88">why did this happen and now I know why</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="6.12">it&amp;#39;s because jessalyn over at Huffington</text>
  <text start="338.13" dur="4.94">Post decided to write an article where</text>
  <text start="340.23" dur="6.63">she made baseless accusations against me</text>
  <text start="343.07" dur="6.7">and decided to bring me to the attention</text>
  <text start="346.86" dur="4.62">of whoever it is at YouTube who can just</text>
  <text start="349.77" dur="4.59">go into the backend and go into my</text>
  <text start="351.48" dur="5.13">channel and D monetize every video on my</text>
  <text start="354.36" dur="3.69">channel even the ones that had already</text>
  <text start="356.61" dur="5.1">been reviewed and cleared for</text>
  <text start="358.05" dur="6.12">monetization somehow so somehow The</text>
  <text start="361.71" dur="4.02">Huffington Post called YouTube and they</text>
  <text start="364.17" dur="5.01">came together and decided that they</text>
  <text start="365.73" dur="5.43">would attack my channel and this is just</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="5.82">I don&amp;#39;t even know what to say to this</text>
  <text start="371.16" dur="6.63">kind of obvious discriminatory practice</text>
  <text start="375" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s going on the obvious collusion</text>
  <text start="377.79" dur="3.63">between the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="378.96" dur="5.01">Democrats and the sensationalist media</text>
  <text start="381.42" dur="6.63">organizations in YouTube who are coming</text>
  <text start="383.97" dur="6.06">after me and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really the it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="388.05" dur="4.65">quite amusing if it weren&amp;#39;t my career in</text>
  <text start="390.03" dur="7.17">my livelihood but and how I support my</text>
  <text start="392.7" dur="8.73">family who depend on me but you know</text>
  <text start="397.2" dur="6.48">this is what we&amp;#39;re up against right so</text>
  <text start="401.43" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s where at the next thing he was</text>
  <text start="403.68" dur="4.739">wrong the audience for YouTube&amp;#39;s top</text>
  <text start="405.81" dur="4.59">conspiracy theory channels is still</text>
  <text start="408.419" dur="3.81">growing a health post investigation</text>
  <text start="410.4" dur="3.9">found well thank you have posts for your</text>
  <text start="412.229" dur="4.381">investigation to show that my channel is</text>
  <text start="414.3" dur="5.01">growing even in the face of all of the</text>
  <text start="416.61" dur="4.589">censorship that&amp;#39;s been thrown up against</text>
  <text start="419.31" dur="3.96">it that&amp;#39;s the funny thing this article</text>
  <text start="421.199" dur="5.611">basically verifies the fact that YouTube</text>
  <text start="423.27" dur="6.209">has actually enacted policies to try to</text>
  <text start="426.81" dur="4.38">discriminate against my content for no</text>
  <text start="429.479" dur="3.241">other reason I guess that my religious</text>
  <text start="431.19" dur="4.97">affiliation and my political affiliation</text>
  <text start="432.72" dur="5.759">and they failed at doing that and now</text>
  <text start="436.16" dur="5.65">this is an article from The Huffington</text>
  <text start="438.479" dur="5.97">Post encouraging YouTube to I guess up</text>
  <text start="441.81" dur="4.52">the the stakes and start coming after me</text>
  <text start="444.449" dur="6.391">even more which they&amp;#39;ve obviously</text>
  <text start="446.33" dur="6.73">completely you know bow down to they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="450.84" dur="4.53">bent the knee to the the Huffington Post</text>
  <text start="453.06" dur="5.43">and decide to go through my channel and</text>
  <text start="455.37" dur="4.68">D monetize every single video so this is</text>
  <text start="458.49" dur="3.45">where it gets really fascinating it says</text>
  <text start="460.05" dur="3.78">using web by analytic tools such as</text>
  <text start="461.94" dur="3.36">social blade and in consultation with</text>
  <text start="463.83" dur="3.99">experts this is the most hilarious</text>
  <text start="465.3" dur="4.649">statement I&amp;#39;ve ever heard this person</text>
  <text start="467.82" dur="4.05">what they did was they went to social</text>
  <text start="469.949" dur="3.631">blade they looked at my page which is</text>
  <text start="471.87" dur="3.479">publicly available anybody may look at</text>
  <text start="473.58" dur="4.709">and then they say they consulted experts</text>
  <text start="475.349" dur="4.771">yeah I&amp;#39;m sure you consulted a lot of</text>
  <text start="478.289" dur="3.721">different experts on this did you get</text>
  <text start="480.12" dur="4.38">the the greatest minds from Harvard</text>
  <text start="482.01" dur="4.77">together to figure out that that I being</text>
  <text start="484.5" dur="4.86">discriminated against by YouTube or was</text>
  <text start="486.78" dur="4.56">it just like a few of your buddies that</text>
  <text start="489.36" dur="4.17">you know I had a youtube channel so I</text>
  <text start="491.34" dur="4.17">guess I&amp;#39;m a YouTube expert I had like 50</text>

  <text start="507.24" dur="5.969">could you imagine the research that it</text>
  <text start="508.8" dur="7.59">takes to look at over 12 things Wow</text>
  <text start="513.209" dur="6.651">Huffington Post your game is top notch</text>
  <text start="516.39" dur="6.329">over 12 the channels you looked at</text>
  <text start="519.86" dur="4.99">conspiracy theory videos channels good</text>
  <text start="522.719" dur="3.511">job and how they&amp;#39;re set subscriber</text>

  <text start="528.42" dur="3.539">and slower rates than before others at</text>
  <text start="530.52" dur="4.79">around the same rates or a bit more</text>
  <text start="531.959" dur="5.211">rapidly changes to video production</text>
  <text start="535.31" dur="3.33">can affect growth but as these YouTube</text>

  <text start="557.15" dur="4.5">commentary on news but I guess that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="559.55" dur="4.71">too much for the Huffington Post to</text>
  <text start="561.65" dur="4.62">accept then they have some random quote</text>

  <text start="1229.07" dur="6.09">platforms Facebook Twitter YouTube</text>
  <text start="1231.17" dur="5.88">Google and what we all know has happened</text>
  <text start="1235.16" dur="4.86">is is that conservative voices have been</text>
  <text start="1237.05" dur="5.31">squelched on those on those platforms</text>
  <text start="1240.02" dur="5.28">and are not able to get have their</text>

  <text start="1245.3" dur="4.86">negative for people who believe in free</text>
  <text start="1248.3" dur="5.76">speech in our Constitution so what</text>
  <text start="1250.16" dur="5.88">Dustin asked me to do was to undertake</text>
  <text start="1254.06" dur="4.05">the research because both as we</text>
  <text start="1256.04" dur="3.9">discussed at the outset you know</text>
  <text start="1258.11" dur="3.24">initially what happened is people would</text>
  <text start="1259.94" dur="4.08">bring these lawsuits and they would lose</text>
  <text start="1261.35" dur="5.1">when confronted by the Communications</text>

  <text start="1332.149" dur="3.63">sent around an issue I just had happen</text>
  <text start="1334.1" dur="5.1">to me recently and I&amp;#39;m sure Dustin&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1335.779" dur="6.15">gone through this as well I woke up</text>
  <text start="1339.2" dur="4.859">yesterday and I&amp;#39;ve had this problem with</text>
  <text start="1341.929" dur="3.931">YouTube going in and there D monetizing</text>
  <text start="1344.059" dur="3.87">my content which is fine you know their</text>
  <text start="1345.86" dur="5.039">monetization program runs in a certain</text>
  <text start="1347.929" dur="5.581">way that they can decide what is you</text>
  <text start="1350.899" dur="5.941">know suitable for all advertisers I get</text>
  <text start="1353.51" dur="5.279">that but what they did is originally I</text>
  <text start="1356.84" dur="5.01">had about 80% of my library believe it</text>
  <text start="1358.789" dur="4.62">or not completely categorized as not</text>
  <text start="1361.85" dur="3.209">suitable for most advertisers but a lot</text>
  <text start="1363.409" dur="3.691">of other videos were monetized meaning</text>
  <text start="1365.059" dur="5.34">like a video that I did at Christmas</text>
  <text start="1367.1" dur="5.549">where I gave $1,000 to you know a bunch</text>
  <text start="1370.399" dur="3.78">of different charities and that was the</text>
  <text start="1372.649" dur="3.27">whole videos like 10 minute video of me</text>
  <text start="1374.179" dur="3.421">saying here I&amp;#39;m donating to all these</text>
  <text start="1375.919" dur="4.74">charities for Christmas I encourage you</text>
  <text start="1377.6" dur="5.22">guys to do the same and I woke up and I</text>
  <text start="1380.659" dur="4.051">realized every video in my library that</text>
  <text start="1382.82" dur="6.06">I&amp;#39;ve done over the last two years has</text>
  <text start="1384.71" dur="6.9">been switched from being suitable for</text>
  <text start="1388.88" dur="4.56">monetization in some cases where it had</text>
  <text start="1391.61" dur="5.01">gone through the manual review process</text>
  <text start="1393.44" dur="5.82">now the whole library&amp;#39;s been D monetized</text>
  <text start="1396.62" dur="4.559">and this is just one example of many but</text>
  <text start="1399.26" dur="5.279">I mean are you looking into the</text>
  <text start="1401.179" dur="4.951">monetization at Google and YouTube and</text>
  <text start="1404.539" dur="3.031">how that that&amp;#39;s a discriminatory</text>
  <text start="1406.13" dur="2.94">practice and then I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="1407.57" dur="3.93">religious discrimination which I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1409.07" dur="3.66">experiencing on this platform more than</text>
  <text start="1411.5" dur="2.64">anything else and I want to talk to you</text>
  <text start="1412.73" dur="3.449">about a very specific example of that</text>
  <text start="1414.14" dur="4.28">but what are your thoughts Todd I&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="1416.179" dur="5.211">to hear your opinion</text>
  <text start="1418.42" dur="5.1">well that what what dust and I have been</text>
  <text start="1421.39" dur="4.8">working on is as I mentioned earlier</text>
  <text start="1423.52" dur="4.79">finding the the side door you know past</text>
  <text start="1426.19" dur="4.05">the the walls and the mode of the castle</text>
  <text start="1428.31" dur="4.48">once you&amp;#39;re able to breach the</text>
  <text start="1430.24" dur="4.23">fortification so to speak then you talk</text>
  <text start="1432.79" dur="4.02">about what are the damages that people</text>
  <text start="1434.47" dur="5.04">have suffered now the whole monetization</text>
  <text start="1436.81" dur="4.62">issue creates you know some challenges</text>
  <text start="1439.51" dur="3.33">because advertisers certainly have a</text>
  <text start="1441.43" dur="4.2">right to determine where their money</text>
  <text start="1442.84" dur="5.33">goes but to the extent that a social</text>
  <text start="1445.63" dur="6.27">media platforms such as YouTube is</text>
  <text start="1448.17" dur="5.92">picking and choosing based upon politics</text>
  <text start="1451.9" dur="4.98">or those views saying well you you have</text>
  <text start="1454.09" dur="4.71">a conservative viewpoint I think that</text>
  <text start="1456.88" dur="3.87">creates a problem but but these are very</text>
  <text start="1458.8" dur="5.1">difficult problems to overcome because</text>
  <text start="1460.75" dur="5.19">if you were a business and you you know</text>
  <text start="1463.9" dur="3.42">and you wanted to to advertise you would</text>
  <text start="1465.94" dur="3.39">be able to choose I&amp;#39;m going to advertise</text>
  <text start="1467.32" dur="3.72">with this voice or with that voice I</text>
  <text start="1469.33" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t want my advertising associated</text>
  <text start="1471.04" dur="4.44">with say a Christian perspective and in</text>
  <text start="1473.86" dur="4.77">the advertiser gets to make that choice</text>
  <text start="1475.48" dur="5.7">so that the monetization issue is a big</text>
  <text start="1478.63" dur="5.04">deal but it is closely intertwined with</text>
  <text start="1481.18" dur="4.32">the freedom of speech issue in other</text>
  <text start="1483.67" dur="4.34">words can you use monetization to</text>
  <text start="1485.5" dur="5.22">squelch speech that you don&amp;#39;t like and</text>
  <text start="1488.01" dur="5.05">that would be something that that once</text>
  <text start="1490.72" dur="4.44">we filed a lawsuit we would go in and</text>
  <text start="1493.06" dur="5.07">look it through what they call discovery</text>
  <text start="1495.16" dur="4.59">through discovering what the defendant</text>
  <text start="1498.13" dur="3.78">in the case let&amp;#39;s say it&amp;#39;s YouTube has</text>
  <text start="1499.75" dur="3.93">what their practices are what their</text>
  <text start="1501.91" dur="3.78">people say about how they did it and you</text>
  <text start="1503.68" dur="3.9">might be able to find a religious</text>
  <text start="1505.69" dur="4.77">discriminatory intent or something like</text>
  <text start="1507.58" dur="5.49">that behind your D monetization and I</text>
  <text start="1510.46" dur="4.47">think that would that would create you</text>
  <text start="1513.07" dur="3.96">know potentially actionable conduct and</text>
  <text start="1514.93" dur="5.79">you know real quick when you look at I</text>
  <text start="1517.03" dur="7.56">wrote an article on my on my website</text>
  <text start="1520.72" dur="6.21">about the Laura Loomer lawsuit and you</text>
  <text start="1524.59" dur="4.71">know she basically made some comments</text>
  <text start="1526.93" dur="5.82">about enol Elan Omar representative of</text>
  <text start="1529.3" dur="6.21">Omar being an adherent to Sharia law it</text>
  <text start="1532.75" dur="4.59">stated the truth in her comments yet she</text>
  <text start="1535.51" dur="3.96">was I think I think the right word is</text>
  <text start="1537.34" dur="4.29">the platform banned from social media</text>
  <text start="1539.47" dur="4.71">for making these comments that were true</text>
  <text start="1541.63" dur="5.28">and really came from a religious</text>
  <text start="1544.18" dur="5.01">perspective you know saying this is what</text>
  <text start="1546.91" dur="4.869">this religion says and we want you to</text>
  <text start="1549.19" dur="5.429">know that so you know that does the</text>
  <text start="1551.779" dur="5.52">religious issues present an issue and</text>
  <text start="1554.619" dur="4.6">and you know banning people based upon</text>
  <text start="1557.299" dur="4.291">religious statements and police are</text>
  <text start="1559.219" dur="4.59">certainly completely violative of the</text>
  <text start="1561.59" dur="3.439">Constitution and a denial of First</text>
  <text start="1563.809" dur="4.07">Amendment rights to freedom of speech</text>
  <text start="1565.029" dur="5.23">but one real quick to your point there</text>
  <text start="1567.879" dur="5.77">everything you just said I couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1570.259" dur="5.28">agree with more and also one of the</text>
  <text start="1573.649" dur="3.57">things that has been a big issue for me</text>
  <text start="1575.539" dur="3.99">as an evangelist I&amp;#39;m a Christian</text>
  <text start="1577.219" dur="5.88">evangelist and and every video I post</text>
  <text start="1579.529" dur="6.181">has a message from you know from from me</text>
  <text start="1583.099" dur="4.14">you know about God and God&amp;#39;s grace and</text>
  <text start="1585.71" dur="4.11">God&amp;#39;s glory and I&amp;#39;ve actually</text>
  <text start="1587.239" dur="4.92">encountered this complete discrimination</text>
  <text start="1589.82" dur="4.439">in the sense that when you go on YouTube</text>
  <text start="1592.159" dur="4.26">right and the back end there are</text>
  <text start="1594.259" dur="3.9">categories with which you can label your</text>
  <text start="1596.419" dur="3.42">content and what I&amp;#39;ve always found</text>
  <text start="1598.159" dur="3.75">interesting is that they don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="1599.839" dur="4.08">religious or spiritual category which</text>
  <text start="1601.909" dur="5.281">you can put yourself into which I found</text>
  <text start="1603.919" dur="4.61">that to be slightly discriminatory in</text>
  <text start="1607.19" dur="3.299">the fact they wouldn&amp;#39;t provide that</text>
  <text start="1608.529" dur="3.97">given that they know a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1610.489" dur="3.75">contents on their platform is spiritual</text>
  <text start="1612.499" dur="3.15">or religious in nature but that is a</text>
  <text start="1614.239" dur="2.88">whole other thing</text>
  <text start="1615.649" dur="3.33">Dustin what do you think about</text>

  <text start="1724.12" dur="4.409">do we how do we calculate that I mean is</text>
  <text start="1726.85" dur="3.51">that gonna just have two comments in the</text>
  <text start="1728.529" dur="4.02">form of a suit like you said where we</text>
  <text start="1730.36" dur="4.26">find that side door and then we start</text>
  <text start="1732.549" dur="4.081">having discovery and we say we need</text>
  <text start="1734.62" dur="4.769">transparency on how you&amp;#39;re making these</text>

  <text start="1759.88" dur="4.2">and I&amp;#39;m thinking to myself you know me</text>
  <text start="1762.309" dur="4.11">as a Christian evangelist who just gets</text>
  <text start="1764.08" dur="4.11">up and talks about you know God and</text>

  <text start="1774.88" dur="5.31">be these days right I do make clear I do</text>
  <text start="1777.519" dur="5.4">have an opinion and it&amp;#39;s not exactly the</text>
  <text start="1780.19" dur="4.709">news it&amp;#39;s an editorial but look I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1782.919" dur="4.651">asking you what are your thoughts on</text>
  <text start="1784.899" dur="5.91">that kind of discrepancy in patan in the</text>
  <text start="1787.57" dur="9.42">in how they effectively implement the</text>
  <text start="1790.809" dur="8.701">rules yeah I mean to me to allow a you</text>
  <text start="1796.99" dur="3.99">know video I haven&amp;#39;t seen the video you</text>
  <text start="1799.51" dur="4.11">described but to allow something like</text>
  <text start="1800.98" dur="5.579">that to be monetized and then to D</text>
  <text start="1803.62" dur="6.659">monetize someone who professors of faith</text>

  <text start="1824.88" dur="5.159">can you know get in the side door unless</text>
  <text start="1827.13" dur="5.22">we can find out exactly how they are</text>
  <text start="1830.039" dur="4.651">programming their algorithms what types</text>
  <text start="1832.35" dur="6.14">of decisions they&amp;#39;re making to show that</text>
  <text start="1834.69" dur="6.63">they are discriminating against groups</text>
  <text start="1838.49" dur="4.779">whom they do not favor</text>
  <text start="1841.32" dur="3.209">you know until we can do that we&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="1849.63" dur="4.289">able to mount an effort to do that but</text>
  <text start="1852.24" dur="3.419">you can imagine what that what that</text>
  <text start="1853.919" dur="3.571">fight would be like to go against these</text>
  <text start="1855.659" dur="3.541">you know the largest most valuable</text>
  <text start="1857.49" dur="4.23">countries in the world are companies in</text>
  <text start="1859.2" dur="3.089">the world and get them to reveal their</text>

  <text start="1862.289" dur="4.921">all we know are the results of what they</text>
  <text start="1864.69" dur="5.13">do and the results are that people like</text>
  <text start="1867.21" dur="3.99">you who believe in the First Amendment</text>
  <text start="1869.82" dur="3.359">and want to have your right to profess</text>
  <text start="1871.2" dur="6.359">your faith openly and publicly on these</text>
  <text start="1873.179" dur="8.13">huge platforms are disfavored and people</text>
  <text start="1877.559" dur="6">who have videos that show graphic</text>
  <text start="1881.309" dur="5.07">violence and destruction are favored and</text>
  <text start="1883.559" dur="5.911">if we don&amp;#39;t change that conversation our</text>
  <text start="1886.379" dur="5.701">countries and serious jeopardy of not</text>
  <text start="1889.47" dur="5.669">getting back away from all that best and</text>
  <text start="1892.08" dur="7.92">going down the wrong path way here Wow</text>
  <text start="1895.139" dur="7.29">yeah truer words have never been said so</text>
  <text start="1900" dur="4.86">I mean to me exactly what you said is</text>
  <text start="1902.429" dur="4.771">exactly where we are at at this moment</text>
  <text start="1904.86" dur="4.98">in time and I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m fully planning on</text>
  <text start="1907.2" dur="4.8">helping to support this action moving</text>
  <text start="1909.84" dur="5.01">forward I look forward to working with</text>
  <text start="1912" dur="5.34">you and Dustin with regard to just</text>
  <text start="1914.85" dur="5.579">continuing to figure out how we can</text>
  <text start="1917.34" dur="6.51">approach this situation and resolve it</text>
  <text start="1920.429" dur="5.791">like you said and I do believe that</text>
  <text start="1923.85" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s much broader and</text>
  <text start="1926.22" dur="5.669">huge larger implications to all this and</text>
  <text start="1928.59" dur="4.89">I I&amp;#39;m gonna start crowd sourcing some</text>
  <text start="1931.889" dur="3.571">funding for this because we got to get</text>
  <text start="1933.48" dur="4.319">the funding to make it happen</text>
  <text start="1935.46" dur="4.38">but um with that being said dust and you</text>
  <text start="1937.799" dur="5.46">have any other thoughts on this I&amp;#39;d love</text>
  <text start="1939.84" dur="5.61">to hear your side too well yeah you know</text>
  <text start="1943.259" dur="5.821">it&amp;#39;s basically as I see it it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1945.45" dur="5.819">roundtable called free speech and eyes</text>
  <text start="1949.08" dur="3.57">that as a roundtable because I want to</text>
  <text start="1951.269" dur="3.091">see all of the influence</text>
  <text start="1952.65" dur="4.47">from every movement from every leaf</text>
  <text start="1954.36" dur="4.56">whatever it is you know even people who</text>
  <text start="1957.12" dur="4.41">disagree with with us politically are</text>
  <text start="1958.92" dur="4.59">welcome if they considered who care</text>
  <text start="1961.53" dur="4.23">about free speech and care about the the</text>
  <text start="1963.51" dur="4.59">battleground of ideas and it&amp;#39;d be kind</text>
  <text start="1965.76" dur="4.53">of the free market of ideas and living</text>
  <text start="1968.1" dur="4.89">in a society governed on on logic truth</text>
  <text start="1970.29" dur="6.09">reason compassion evidence rather than</text>
  <text start="1972.99" dur="7.08">Authority and and you know coercion and</text>
  <text start="1976.38" dur="5.49">censorship and and you know intimidation</text>
  <text start="1980.07" dur="4.47">through through these various tactics</text>
  <text start="1981.87" dur="4.38">like an Tifa and then others and then de</text>
  <text start="1984.54" dur="4.56">platforming and all of this nonsense</text>
  <text start="1986.25" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;re going through well that in the you</text>
  <text start="1989.1" dur="3.05">know that brings me into one more</text>
  <text start="1990.09" dur="4.83">question I have specifically for Todd</text>
  <text start="1992.15" dur="4">have you and then we can kind of pivot</text>
  <text start="1994.92" dur="3.24">over to you Dustin if you have any</text>
  <text start="1996.15" dur="5.19">thoughts on as well but Todd have you</text>
  <text start="1998.16" dur="5.73">seen this latest video from Project</text>
  <text start="2001.34" dur="6.21">Veritas with the latest whistleblower</text>
  <text start="2003.89" dur="5.58">senior Google engineer who is basically</text>
  <text start="2007.55" dur="4.43">obviously you know saying that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2009.47" dur="5.18">working on a different project but</text>
  <text start="2011.98" dur="5.26">basically saying that the the the</text>
  <text start="2014.65" dur="5.56">environment inside of Google is one</text>
  <text start="2017.24" dur="5.79">where if you are not a leftist and</text>
  <text start="2020.21" dur="4.56">extreme leftist Democrat you are</text>
  <text start="2023.03" dur="5.25">discriminated against and this is being</text>
  <text start="2024.77" dur="4.98">implemented it like across the globe as</text>
  <text start="2028.28" dur="3.029">far as their algorithms going that they</text>
  <text start="2029.75" dur="4.08">are manipulating their algorithms</text>
  <text start="2031.309" dur="5.311">against our content because this brings</text>
  <text start="2033.83" dur="4.65">me to my channel and where I know that</text>
  <text start="2036.62" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;ve stopped suggesting my videos I</text>
  <text start="2038.48" dur="4.59">know that they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;ve taken my</text>
  <text start="2041.09" dur="3.78">content and classified as whatever you</text>
  <text start="2043.07" dur="4.109">would say on the border which has no</text>
  <text start="2044.87" dur="5.34">legal definition obviously it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="2047.179" dur="4.921">internal term that they use at Google to</text>
  <text start="2050.21" dur="4.11">discriminate unfairly and this this</text>
  <text start="2052.1" dur="3.6">exact this engineers coming forward and</text>
  <text start="2054.32" dur="4.26">saying that so what are your thoughts on</text>
  <text start="2055.7" dur="4.92">that Todd well I I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I saw</text>
  <text start="2058.58" dur="3.78">that I&amp;#39;d followed those what Project</text>
  <text start="2060.62" dur="3.059">Veritas has been doing about some of the</text>
  <text start="2062.36" dur="4.319">interviews with these people who make it</text>
  <text start="2063.679" dur="5.041">pretty clear that there is you know</text>
  <text start="2066.679" dur="4.111">discrimination against conservatives and</text>
  <text start="2068.72" dur="3.81">probably even most importantly against</text>
  <text start="2070.79" dur="3.72">religious conservatives I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2072.53" dur="3.99">necessarily know if you were an adherent</text>
  <text start="2074.51" dur="3.51">to a religion other than Christianity</text>
  <text start="2076.52" dur="3.75">that you would suffer the same</text>
  <text start="2078.02" dur="5.55">discrimination but you know in my view</text>
  <text start="2080.27" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s almost like we&amp;#39;re in the Roman</text>
  <text start="2083.57" dur="3.04">times where the the early Christians</text>
  <text start="2085.28" dur="5.26">were discriminated against by</text>
  <text start="2086.61" dur="5.37">by the Roman society and they just had</text>
  <text start="2090.54" dur="4.35">to persevere so I think to a great</text>
  <text start="2091.98" dur="4.98">extent we just have to persevere but I</text>
  <text start="2094.89" dur="5.34">would suspect that if we can get in the</text>
  <text start="2096.96" dur="5.85">side door we will find lots of good</text>
  <text start="2100.23" dur="6.06">information that will be so compelling</text>
  <text start="2102.81" dur="5.88">that it might force change and and</text>
  <text start="2106.29" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s why I think freedom of speech as</text>
  <text start="2108.69" dur="3.78">Dustin says the round table that that no</text>
  <text start="2110.88" dur="2.94">matter your and that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2112.47" dur="2.97">supporting you know no matter your</text>
  <text start="2113.82" dur="3.96">particular political view you have a</text>
  <text start="2115.44" dur="3.78">right to express it and you can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="2117.78" dur="2.94">discriminated against you shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="2119.22" dur="5.1">discriminated against so if we have that</text>
  <text start="2120.72" dur="5.61">round table of free speech then then you</text>
  <text start="2124.32" dur="4.8">know Christians and other conservatives</text>
  <text start="2126.33" dur="4.38">and other voices will have have the</text>
  <text start="2129.12" dur="5.01">ability to get their message out there</text>
  <text start="2130.71" dur="4.89">and I think that getting inside of what</text>
  <text start="2134.13" dur="4.17">these large organizations are doing</text>
  <text start="2135.6" dur="6.54">would reveal a ton of good information</text>
  <text start="2138.3" dur="5.64">and allow us to move away from decisions</text>
  <text start="2142.14" dur="4.41">made by the kind of people that work at</text>
  <text start="2143.94" dur="4.62">these organizations and towards the</text>
  <text start="2146.55" dur="3.81">parameters on free speech established by</text>
  <text start="2148.56" dur="4.75">our own Supreme Court in the laws of the</text>
  <text start="2150.36" dur="4.93">United States so that&amp;#39;s the goal</text>
  <text start="2153.31" dur="4.38">I mean I couldn&amp;#39;t agree more that is the</text>
  <text start="2155.29" dur="4.71">goal I truly want that personally that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2157.69" dur="4.679">all I want is it to be fair and for the</text>
  <text start="2160" dur="4.68">Constitution to apply equally and for</text>
  <text start="2162.369" dur="4.021">this to stop is this just in my opinion</text>
  <text start="2164.68" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s a discrimination it&amp;#39;s a violation</text>
  <text start="2166.39" dur="4.83">of my civil rights it&amp;#39;s a violation of</text>
  <text start="2168.07" dur="6.93">me as a Christian trying to compete in</text>
  <text start="2171.22" dur="6.06">the free and open fair market so that</text>
