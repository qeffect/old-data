  <text start="129.06" dur="4.78">all right so we&amp;#39;re gonna start with</text>
  <text start="131.92" dur="3.87">Julian Assange you guys know that this</text>
  <text start="133.84" dur="5.16">is a man that I consider to be a hero</text>
  <text start="135.79" dur="6.3">who has sacrificed most of his life now</text>
  <text start="139" dur="4.92">in the last decade for us he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="142.09" dur="3.9">trapped in a room with a cat now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.92" dur="3.87">trapped in a prison with no cat I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="145.99" dur="3.87">he misses the cat and he still probably</text>
  <text start="147.79" dur="3.75">misses his family that he hasn&amp;#39;t seen in</text>
  <text start="149.86" dur="4.47">like eight plus years really</text>
  <text start="151.54" dur="5.19">so he&amp;#39;s been trapped behind this cubicle</text>
  <text start="154.33" dur="4.86">sort of existence with a cat in a room</text>
  <text start="156.73" dur="4.32">bland austere basically a prison an</text>
  <text start="159.19" dur="3.57">embassy room so that they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="161.05" dur="3.36">extradite him people would try to get</text>
  <text start="162.76" dur="3.51">him through the windows people would try</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="3.72">to nab him if he left the grounds or the</text>
  <text start="166.27" dur="4.2">property so he was stuck in this room</text>
  <text start="168.13" dur="4.77">for a long time now the powers that be</text>
  <text start="170.47" dur="4.8">obviously are not a fan of Julian</text>
  <text start="172.9" dur="5.7">Assange and they have decided to come</text>
  <text start="175.27" dur="5.58">down on him and make an example so they</text>
  <text start="178.6" dur="4.77">have locked him up with no real charges</text>
  <text start="180.85" dur="4.23">and he&amp;#39;s beaten his his supposed charges</text>
  <text start="183.37" dur="4.68">repeatedly that there was no evidence</text>
  <text start="185.08" dur="5.19">even the woman that supposedly said he</text>
  <text start="188.05" dur="4.38">raped her has backtracked and and said</text>
  <text start="190.27" dur="4.02">this didn&amp;#39;t happen now so all of these</text>
  <text start="192.43" dur="3.18">in the governments of the world still</text>
  <text start="194.29" dur="5.07">want to try to use it against him of</text>
  <text start="195.61" dur="6.27">course the big granddaddy of them all</text>
  <text start="199.36" dur="4.83">being the US and our extradition request</text>
  <text start="201.88" dur="4.5">for him so that we can throw him and get</text>
  <text start="204.19" dur="3.6">no and treat him like a terrorist for</text>
  <text start="206.38" dur="4.29">telling us the truth about our own</text>
  <text start="207.79" dur="5.37">government anyway so Pamela Anderson is</text>
  <text start="210.67" dur="6.54">now seeing that she was threatened by</text>
  <text start="213.16" dur="5.22">the Belmarsh prison warden during her</text>
  <text start="217.21" dur="3.27">visit with Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="218.38" dur="5.19">he threatened to make things harder on</text>
  <text start="220.48" dur="4.62">Assange if she told now this is Pamela</text>
  <text start="223.57" dur="4.47">Anderson she has a voice you know she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="225.1" dur="5.25">really really famous men everywhere will</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="7.29">remember her from the what was it like</text>
  <text start="230.35" dur="7.71">that the beach show Baywatch I think I</text>
  <text start="235.33" dur="4.13">should watch problem say I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="3.9">watched a single episode of Baywatch</text>
  <text start="239.46" dur="4.12">however I think I remember that like</text>
  <text start="241.96" dur="4.14">picture of her running along the beach</text>
  <text start="243.58" dur="5.22">with the lifeguard thingy right its</text>
  <text start="246.1" dur="4.65">iconic and most men in America remember</text>
  <text start="248.8" dur="2.85">this millions tens of millions of people</text>
  <text start="250.75" dur="2.55">know who she is</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="3.9">you can&amp;#39;t escape that and you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="253.3" dur="5.04">threaten the person like that so easily</text>
  <text start="255.55" dur="4.38">however since she was untouchable for</text>
  <text start="258.34" dur="2.36">this prison warden they threatened to</text>
  <text start="259.93" dur="2.84">make things harder</text>
  <text start="260.7" dur="3.18">messange and she admits this and she</text>
  <text start="262.77" dur="2.76">didn&amp;#39;t even know if it was the right</text>
  <text start="263.88" dur="3.63">thing to do to come out and tell this so</text>
  <text start="265.53" dur="3.59">hopefully that prison ward will be</text>
  <text start="267.51" dur="4.35">reprimand or Dan will be reprimanded</text>
  <text start="269.12" dur="5.11">hopefully some justice will be done and</text>
  <text start="271.86" dur="3.72">the signs will protected I can only</text>
  <text start="274.23" dur="3.84">imagine what they&amp;#39;re doing to him right</text>
  <text start="275.58" dur="5.22">now and punishment that&amp;#39;s what they do</text>
  <text start="278.07" dur="4.86">they they&amp;#39;ll punish the prisoner to hurt</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="3.09">the family because they like power and</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="3.15">they know that they can&amp;#39;t just go</text>
  <text start="283.89" dur="2.97">beating up civilians that come visit</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="2.25">them all the time</text>
  <text start="286.86" dur="5.34">because that wouldn&amp;#39;t end well for them</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="6.39">right so we also have fake news Newsweek</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="5.46">slamming President Trump again for</text>
  <text start="294.72" dur="5.25">golfing tweeting and more while he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="297.66" dur="6.39">landing in Afghanistan to visit our</text>
  <text start="299.97" dur="5.97">troops and let&amp;#39;s ignore the old Obama</text>
  <text start="304.05" dur="3.99">era where he would golf for weeks at a</text>
  <text start="305.94" dur="5.58">time on the taxpayers dime at the cost</text>
  <text start="308.04" dur="5.01">of millions of dollars not a shock at</text>
  <text start="311.52" dur="3.99">all and of course</text>
  <text start="313.05" dur="4.59">Jessica Quang from Newsweek is over</text>
  <text start="315.51" dur="4.47">there spreading these lies and she did</text>
  <text start="317.64" dur="5.25">correct later and change it to basically</text>
  <text start="319.98" dur="5.19">an apology something non-committal like</text>
  <text start="322.89" dur="3.96">oh I&amp;#39;ve deleted the other note yeah or</text>
  <text start="325.17" dur="3.24">the other tweet because I didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="326.85" dur="4.41">the full information at the time and now</text>
  <text start="328.41" dur="4.77">I&amp;#39;m issuing a correction but you know no</text>
  <text start="331.26" dur="4.38">real apology in there and and this is a</text>
  <text start="333.18" dur="4.74">trend with Newsweek personally I think</text>
  <text start="335.64" dur="5.31">we should boycott Newsweek and Jessica</text>
  <text start="337.92" dur="4.71">Kwang and we should go to sources of</text>
  <text start="340.95" dur="4.68">news that we trust that don&amp;#39;t lie to us</text>
  <text start="342.63" dur="5.85">repeatedly so you know let them at</text>
  <text start="345.63" dur="4.92">Newsweek just go the way of fake news</text>
  <text start="348.48" dur="5.55">let that company died the same way</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="5.28">BuzzFeed and CNN are dying they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="354.03" dur="4.02">having mass layoffs anyway they are</text>
  <text start="355.83" dur="4.29">shutting down departments and branches</text>
  <text start="358.05" dur="5.37">and hey if you&amp;#39;re still working at those</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="5.55">places people like you Jessica Kwang may</text>
  <text start="363.42" dur="4.62">not be within a job much longer because</text>
  <text start="365.67" dur="4.44">you&amp;#39;re non-stop propaganda and deception</text>
  <text start="368.04" dur="4.89">has nearly destroyed the companies that</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="4.71">you work for I know I know many of you</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="3.93">would say that it was an order but you</text>
  <text start="374.82" dur="4.56">continued to do that job and follow</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="4.02">those orders despite knowing how wrong</text>
  <text start="379.38" dur="3.42">it was despite knowing the damage that</text>
  <text start="380.88" dur="4.02">was being done not only to your career</text>
  <text start="382.8" dur="5.1">but to the country and the fabric of our</text>
  <text start="384.9" dur="5.31">society so I have no sympathy for anyone</text>
  <text start="387.9" dur="4.47">from fake news that loses their job and</text>
  <text start="390.21" dur="4.98">I say this as a journalist whose cost</text>
  <text start="392.37" dur="4.89">a threat of losing mine from censorship</text>
  <text start="395.19" dur="4.44">and I exactly know how it is and I</text>
  <text start="397.26" dur="4.02">understand exactly so people who are</text>
  <text start="399.63" dur="3.509">lying should not be financially</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="4.1">rewarding while people were trying to</text>
  <text start="403.139" dur="5.641">tell the truth and struggling to do so</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="5.41">should try to you know they should be</text>
  <text start="408.78" dur="4.98">the ones that at least have some kind of</text>
  <text start="410.79" dur="5.189">support and funding mechanisms being a</text>
  <text start="413.76" dur="3.77">truth teller being a journalist that or</text>
  <text start="415.979" dur="4.681">citizen journalist that goes out and</text>
  <text start="417.53" dur="4.72">opposes fake news should be rewarding</text>
  <text start="420.66" dur="4.5">for people because you take a risk right</text>
  <text start="422.25" dur="4.88">in generally the more risk you take the</text>
  <text start="425.16" dur="5.759">higher your reward profile if you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="427.13" dur="5.259">Alaskan shrimper and you&amp;#39;re out it you</text>
  <text start="430.919" dur="4.47">know in the ocean for six months at a</text>
  <text start="432.389" dur="5.191">time and choppy icy waters and in rough</text>
  <text start="435.389" dur="4.53">currents and you&amp;#39;re out there collecting</text>
  <text start="437.58" dur="4.02">link boo coos and loads of fish but</text>
  <text start="439.919" dur="3.361">thirty or something percent of that you</text>
  <text start="441.6" dur="3.21">know I don&amp;#39;t what it is exactly but a</text>
  <text start="443.28" dur="3.509">really high number of those people died</text>
  <text start="444.81" dur="5.19">in the jump you should expect to get</text>
  <text start="446.789" dur="4.711">paid for your risk if you get death</text>
  <text start="450" dur="3.63">threats from the deep state all the time</text>
  <text start="451.5" dur="4.139">like I do you don&amp;#39;t get paid anything</text>
  <text start="453.63" dur="3.36">for that you don&amp;#39;t get hazard pay or any</text>
  <text start="455.639" dur="3.661">of that other stuff you don&amp;#39;t get to sit</text>
  <text start="456.99" dur="4.2">in a comfortable office most of us I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="459.3" dur="3.839">fortunate that I do actually get to sit</text>
  <text start="461.19" dur="4.41">in a comfortable office but most of us</text>
  <text start="463.139" dur="4.4">at home most of us don&amp;#39;t get that luxury</text>
  <text start="465.6" dur="4.53">when we&amp;#39;re out there fighting fake news</text>
  <text start="467.539" dur="4.181">you know even sitting at a comfortable</text>
  <text start="470.13" dur="3.06">office at home I still get death threats</text>

  <text start="476.97" dur="4.23">platforms when I go speak at places by</text>
  <text start="479.25" dur="2.599">people like Jack Pacific at American</text>
  <text start="481.2" dur="3.3">priority</text>

  <text start="490.5" dur="3.93">band band out right you guys know what</text>
  <text start="492.599" dur="3.901">we&amp;#39;ve had to go through here to spread</text>
  <text start="494.43" dur="3.63">the truth and you know many of you are</text>
  <text start="496.5" dur="3.99">still donating a dollar or five dollars</text>
  <text start="498.06" dur="4.8">a month just to help us get through why</text>
  <text start="500.49" dur="4.17">is it that Jessica Quan gets to sit</text>
  <text start="502.86" dur="4.14">there probably with a six-figure income</text>
  <text start="504.66" dur="4.41">and make mistakes all the time lying</text>
  <text start="507" dur="4.26">about President Trump issuing really</text>
  <text start="509.07" dur="4.349">loud mistakes and really quiet apologies</text>
  <text start="511.26" dur="4.529">and retractions which is exactly what</text>
  <text start="513.419" dur="4.68">they always do even if they have that</text>
  <text start="515.789" dur="4.771">the wrong information they know it they</text>
  <text start="518.099" dur="4.711">will put out a headline that caters to</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="4.26">their audience that caters to the law</text>
  <text start="522.81" dur="3.03">and then immediately they&amp;#39;ll retract it</text>
  <text start="524.82" dur="3.6">an issue the correct</text>
  <text start="525.84" dur="4.38">but one-fourth or less of the people</text>
  <text start="528.42" dur="3.9">will see it so you know they&amp;#39;ll shout</text>
  <text start="530.22" dur="6.99">lies and whisper apologies and it does</text>
  <text start="532.32" dur="6.68">it&amp;#39;s not fair so anyway I mean to go off</text>
  <text start="537.21" dur="4.17">into fake news that much but just</text>
  <text start="539" dur="4.93">another example and if you guys haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="541.38" dur="4.8">seen any of the recent queue posts or</text>
  <text start="543.93" dur="3.99">cute videos I&amp;#39;ve done go check those out</text>
  <text start="546.18" dur="4.38">and one of those talked about a</text>
  <text start="547.92" dur="4.35">particular tweet thread like 90</text>

  <text start="557.1" dur="3.81">and I set them into three videos with</text>
  <text start="559.32" dur="3.99">the help of my producer David who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.91" dur="4.71">amazing and he said them so that we</text>

  <text start="571.17" dur="4.77">puts you know from newsweek for example</text>
  <text start="573.45" dur="4.079">to different articles that contradict</text>
  <text start="575.94" dur="3.45">each other to different headlines from</text>
  <text start="577.529" dur="4.051">the same year from the same company and</text>

  <text start="1326.47" dur="3.72">stefan molyneux goes through this as</text>
  <text start="1328.45" dur="4.5">well with a myth of the noble savage</text>
  <text start="1330.19" dur="4.709">because look I&amp;#39;m not bashing Native</text>
  <text start="1332.95" dur="3.93">Americans that they were beheading and</text>
  <text start="1334.899" dur="3.51">sacrificing and raping and pillaging and</text>
  <text start="1336.88" dur="3.69">killing a lot of people before we came</text>
  <text start="1338.409" dur="4.591">and we got here that included us and</text>
  <text start="1340.57" dur="4.079">then a lot of the stuff that happened</text>
  <text start="1343" dur="3.62">around Thanksgiving itself was actually</text>
  <text start="1344.649" dur="4.41">very peaceful and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1346.62" dur="4.899">atrocities can you know contributed to</text>
  <text start="1349.059" dur="4.651">the white man are actually the diseases</text>
  <text start="1351.519" dur="3.9">that we accidentally brought over so</text>
  <text start="1353.71" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s not like you know we were here to</text>
  <text start="1355.419" dur="3.691">just mass murder yes they were worse</text>
  <text start="1356.95" dur="5.849">that happened on both sides and horrific</text>
  <text start="1359.11" dur="5.97">acts of rape violence scalping oh you</text>
  <text start="1362.799" dur="4.201">know that only happened on one side and</text>
  <text start="1365.08" dur="3.089">and slavery and things like that and of</text>
  <text start="1367" dur="2.94">course they already had things like</text>
  <text start="1368.169" dur="3.96">slavery and violence and death and war</text>
  <text start="1369.94" dur="2.81">before we came it was not the peaceful</text>
  <text start="1372.129" dur="3.53">Utah</text>
  <text start="1372.75" dur="4.409">it was made to be and in some cases more</text>
  <text start="1375.659" dur="3.481">like South American and stuff they were</text>
  <text start="1377.159" dur="2.971">they were still human sacrifices going</text>
  <text start="1379.14" dur="2.399">on I don&amp;#39;t know if that was still</text>
  <text start="1380.13" dur="3.45">happening in North America when we got</text>
  <text start="1381.539" dur="4.14">here so it&amp;#39;s not all that it was made</text>
  <text start="1383.58" dur="4.229">out to be that the white man came and</text>
  <text start="1385.679" dur="4.86">destroyed the world and and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1387.809" dur="4.321">problem of everyone else and you know</text>
  <text start="1390.539" dur="3.711">this is why everyone else failed to</text>
  <text start="1392.13" dur="5.82">thrive and why their cultures were</text>
  <text start="1394.25" dur="6.97">largely abandoned I mean in Hawaii they</text>
  <text start="1397.95" dur="5.849">used to commit sacrifice of children in</text>
  <text start="1401.22" dur="4.949">the volcanoes and stuff so it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="1403.799" dur="4.651">it was all bad I think that it was as</text>
  <text start="1406.169" dur="5.401">crowd or even made the point this was a</text>
  <text start="1408.45" dur="5.459">positive change for people and even if</text>
  <text start="1411.57" dur="4.41">there were instances where they were you</text>
  <text start="1413.909" dur="4.77">know like worldwide our culture one</text>
  <text start="1415.98" dur="4.679">maybe whatever you may say good or bad</text>
  <text start="1418.679" dur="5.73">or violent or nonviolent peaceful trade</text>
  <text start="1420.659" dur="6.361">or violent conquest our Western society</text>
  <text start="1424.409" dur="5.161">our Western culture dominated these</text>
  <text start="1427.02" dur="4.289">other cultures eventually replacing them</text>
  <text start="1429.57" dur="5.7">for the most part because it was</text>
  <text start="1431.309" dur="6.36">superior not perfect but superior you</text>
  <text start="1435.27" dur="4.23">know a lot of modern inventions we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1437.669" dur="4.081">revolutionized a lot of the things that</text>
  <text start="1439.5" dur="4.14">they thought about nature so they had to</text>
  <text start="1441.75" dur="3.809">stop the sacrifices and stuff of their</text>
  <text start="1443.64" dur="4.47">children things like that you know we</text>
  <text start="1445.559" dur="5.431">changed the world for the better</text>
  <text start="1448.11" dur="4.47">so you get a lot of pushback especially</text>
  <text start="1450.99" dur="4.01">from your kids over the holidays if</text>
  <text start="1452.58" dur="4.829">you&amp;#39;ve got college-age kids or or</text>
  <text start="1455" dur="4">grandkids maybe coming in they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1457.409" dur="4.051">start pushing back against the</text>
  <text start="1459" dur="4.08">colonialism of white oppression and and</text>
  <text start="1461.46" dur="4.17">all this crazy stuff that they were</text>
  <text start="1463.08" dur="6.959">taught in school and it&amp;#39;s all based on</text>
  <text start="1465.63" dur="6.57">bogus lies and race-based hate which is</text>
  <text start="1470.039" dur="4.111">being pumped out of the colleges and the</text>
  <text start="1472.2" dur="3.719">high schools I mean that&amp;#39;s what happens</text>
  <text start="1474.15" dur="5.149">when Marxism takes over the education</text>
  <text start="1475.919" dur="6.721">system so I just wanted to address this</text>
  <text start="1479.299" dur="6.01">with a little context and just give</text>
  <text start="1482.64" dur="5.31">people an example now Rand Paul reminds</text>
  <text start="1485.309" dur="4.651">people that he says don&amp;#39;t forget the</text>
  <text start="1487.95" dur="4.469">first Thanksgiving only happens when the</text>
  <text start="1489.96" dur="4.199">pilgrims rejected socialism which is a</text>
  <text start="1492.419" dur="6.24">much faster way of saying what I just</text>
  <text start="1494.159" dur="6.781">said we also have Angela Merkel in</text>

  <text start="1890.89" dur="5.01">that you have it necessarily so there is</text>
  <text start="1892.96" dur="4.86">an appeal to to use these currencies</text>
  <text start="1895.9" dur="4.32">because they are a free currency to some</text>

  <text start="1921.34" dur="5.34">tend to have a finite amount of coins</text>
  <text start="1923.89" dur="4.8">that can be produced you know like the</text>

  <text start="1928.69" dur="3.51">total and some of those have been lost</text>

  <text start="1974.5" dur="5.49">little bit about cryptos here because</text>
  <text start="1976.59" dur="5.68">some of the BRICS nations are and have</text>

  <text start="1984.55" dur="4.37">more of a digital currency I want to</text>
  <text start="1986.5" dur="4.679">differentiate because a crypto graphic</text>
  <text start="1988.92" dur="4.84">security token or something that has a</text>

  <text start="1993.76" dur="6.27">designed to be generally speaking</text>
  <text start="1996.48" dur="5.949">decentralized maybe Anonymous maybe not</text>
  <text start="2000.03" dur="4.74">bitcoins not anonymous Manero is things</text>
  <text start="2002.429" dur="4.681">like that and certainly it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="2004.77" dur="5.13">have a lot of those different factors</text>
  <text start="2007.11" dur="5.67">whereas a digital currency is going to</text>
  <text start="2009.9" dur="4.44">be centralized one good example being a</text>
  <text start="2012.78" dur="2.42">ripple which is one of the top five most</text>

  <text start="2017.429" dur="4.291">crypto and that&amp;#39;s going to be something</text>
  <text start="2019.65" dur="3.48">closer to a digital dollar like we</text>
