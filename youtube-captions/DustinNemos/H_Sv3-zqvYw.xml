  <text start="339.39" dur="5.12">back to the child trafficking issue</text>
  <text start="341.79" dur="6.09">remember the wiki leaked emails</text>
  <text start="344.51" dur="5.95">undeniable 100 percent accuracy rate</text>
  <text start="347.88" dur="4.32">WikiLeaks this is why they&amp;#39;re hated this</text>
  <text start="350.46" dur="4.62">is why Assange is being tortured right</text>
  <text start="352.2" dur="4.89">now the the physicians and the</text>
  <text start="355.08" dur="4.14">psychiatrist that that checked in on him</text>
  <text start="357.09" dur="4.61">with the attorney said that he showed</text>
  <text start="359.22" dur="4.04">all of these symptoms of being</text>
  <text start="361.7" dur="4.02">psychologically tortured</text>
  <text start="363.26" dur="4.68">can&amp;#39;t relax he&amp;#39;s on edge all the time he</text>
  <text start="365.72" dur="4.29">can never shut down his his nervous</text>
  <text start="367.94" dur="4.44">system is in flight or fight all the</text>
  <text start="370.01" dur="6.09">time this is killing him and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.38" dur="7.44">starting to show now that also plays</text>
  <text start="376.1" dur="5.07">very difficult mind games with one all</text>
  <text start="379.82" dur="4.86">right now</text>
  <text start="381.17" dur="6.78">this poor guy deserves our support but</text>
  <text start="384.68" dur="5.58">for having done such a terrible crime to</text>
  <text start="387.95" dur="4.89">uncover these child trafficking types</text>
  <text start="390.26" dur="4.68">and I do believe that Podesta is a child</text>
  <text start="392.84" dur="4.26">trafficker and I do believe that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.94" dur="4.68">exactly what the Wikileak D mails most</text>
  <text start="397.1" dur="5.15">logically consist of when you actually</text>
  <text start="399.62" dur="2.63">think about it</text>
  <text start="402.73" dur="5.89">that is why Seth rich was murdered that</text>
  <text start="405.47" dur="7.41">is why they accused it all of Russian</text>
  <text start="408.62" dur="8.25">hacking to distract from the truth of</text>
  <text start="412.88" dur="5.43">the WikiLeaks and now the people behind</text>
  <text start="416.87" dur="4.14">that the people tied to the human</text>
  <text start="418.31" dur="5.52">trafficking look the potential pedophile</text>
  <text start="421.01" dur="6.24">predators are going after POTUS with</text>
  <text start="423.83" dur="7.53">lawsuits from dark money how much more</text>
  <text start="427.25" dur="6.15">obvious needed be we also have 2020</text>
  <text start="431.36" dur="3.99">Democrats wall well warning if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.4" dur="3.87">Hispanic Trump will deport you because</text>
  <text start="435.35" dur="4.5">apparently if you are Hispanic you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="437.27" dur="6.42">not from here so this is the the race</text>
  <text start="439.85" dur="5.73">over law kind of thing like this is a</text>
  <text start="443.69" dur="4.26">framing perspective this is seeing the</text>
  <text start="445.58" dur="5.73">world through the lens of race rather</text>
  <text start="447.95" dur="5.01">than the lens of moral because someone</text>
  <text start="451.31" dur="3.75">who is Hispanic did something illegal</text>
  <text start="452.96" dur="4.77">and was in trouble and was therefore</text>
  <text start="455.06" dur="4.71">deported if you are Hispanic therefore</text>
  <text start="457.73" dur="4.89">you have a connection to them even if</text>
  <text start="459.77" dur="4.23">you&amp;#39;re born here and and you know Latino</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="3.69">origin or whatever and you&amp;#39;re born here</text>
  <text start="464" dur="4.05">in your US citizen and you&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="466.31" dur="3.18">you know US culture and you respect the</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="3.15">flag in the nation and whatever</text>
  <text start="469.49" dur="3.87">well apparently you should still be</text>
  <text start="471.2" dur="6.18">afraid because you guys have the same</text>
  <text start="473.36" dur="6.06">race so it doesn&amp;#39;t make a lot of sense</text>
  <text start="477.38" dur="5.28">you know clearly if you break the law</text>
  <text start="479.42" dur="6.21">shouldn&amp;#39;t matter what your race is but</text>
  <text start="482.66" dur="4.62">apparently it does and that is I think</text>
  <text start="485.63" dur="3.93">what they&amp;#39;re hoping to count they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="487.28" dur="5.34">counting on that to win them elections</text>
  <text start="489.56" dur="5.05">and it just doesn&amp;#39;t work anymore I did</text>
  <text start="492.62" dur="3.88">for a long time we have had a lot of</text>
  <text start="494.61" dur="5.549">to our culture in our society from this</text>
  <text start="496.5" dur="4.8">problem but you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s turning</text>

  <text start="858.05" dur="3.12">well if you don&amp;#39;t like it start your own</text>
  <text start="859.279" dur="3.601">Google right and the problem with that</text>
  <text start="861.17" dur="3.539">is is that when you have a monopoly as</text>
  <text start="862.88" dur="3.36">Google really does I mean good luck with</text>
  <text start="864.709" dur="3.151">that I mean companies have tried to</text>
  <text start="866.24" dur="2.94">start up Google buys them Google</text>
  <text start="867.86" dur="3.719">suppresses them engages in</text>
  <text start="869.18" dur="4.769">anti-competitive conduct you know some</text>
  <text start="871.579" dur="4.591">people say oh this is this is for speech</text>
  <text start="873.949" dur="3.841">my approach is forcing the companies to</text>
  <text start="876.17" dur="3.39">engage me that&amp;#39;s just nonsense this</text>
  <text start="877.79" dur="4.44">isn&amp;#39;t forced speech at all it is</text>
  <text start="879.56" dur="4.38">stopping discrimination against speech</text>
  <text start="882.23" dur="3.539">by these companies I know I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="883.94" dur="3.92">the companies to speak in any particular</text>
  <text start="885.769" dur="4.68">way my point is just this stop</text>
  <text start="887.86" dur="4.959">discriminating against conservatives</text>
  <text start="890.449" dur="4.44">stop suppressing other viewpoints that</text>
  <text start="892.819" dur="4.351">you don&amp;#39;t agree with I mean it&amp;#39;s just as</text>
  <text start="894.889" dur="2.731">simple as that unless I&amp;#39;m missing</text>
  <text start="897.17" dur="2.52">something</text>
  <text start="897.62" dur="4.769">what your bill would do would just</text>
  <text start="899.69" dur="4.8">remove the special protections that they</text>
  <text start="902.389" dur="4.44">have that for example I do not enjoy as</text>
  <text start="904.49" dur="3.959">a broadcaster Fox News as a news company</text>
  <text start="906.829" dur="3.63">we don&amp;#39;t enjoy we can be sued if we</text>

  <text start="910.459" dur="4.32">be sued we don&amp;#39;t have this immunity we</text>
  <text start="913.01" dur="3.569">do is just put them into my category</text>
  <text start="914.779" dur="3.511">that&amp;#39;s exactly right I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="916.579" dur="3.69">exactly right I mean to be clear these</text>
  <text start="918.29" dur="3.779">big tech companies Facebook and Google</text>
  <text start="920.269" dur="3.961">and YouTube Twitter they have a deal</text>

  <text start="924.23" dur="4.44">has this deal no other publisher has</text>
  <text start="926.269" dur="4.741">this deal they have this special carve</text>
  <text start="928.67" dur="4.89">out this special handout from government</text>
  <text start="931.01" dur="4.47">and if they want to keep it my view is</text>
  <text start="933.56" dur="2.94">they should quit discriminating on the</text>
  <text start="935.48" dur="2.52">other hand if they want to discriminate</text>
  <text start="936.5" dur="3.24">against conservatives if they want to</text>
  <text start="938" dur="3.6">push a liberal agenda that&amp;#39;s fine but</text>
  <text start="939.74" dur="3.959">you shouldn&amp;#39;t get they shouldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
