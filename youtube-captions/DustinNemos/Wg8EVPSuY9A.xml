  <text start="82.68" dur="3.72">right because they&amp;#39;re like 1,200 bucks</text>
  <text start="84.17" dur="3.61">for a treasure which is not unhackable</text>
  <text start="86.4" dur="3.359">and there&amp;#39;s a ledger and things like</text>

  <text start="113.28" dur="3.96">classy this is a well-made product I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="2.04">been waiting on this thing for a long</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="4.739">time</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="5.76">McAfee has has basically been talking</text>
  <text start="121.979" dur="3.93">about it and he&amp;#39;s finally got it up he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.57" dur="4.079">got a two hundred and fifty thousand</text>
  <text start="125.909" dur="3.63">dollar reward for anyone that can hack</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="3.03">this thing now of course there&amp;#39;s a bunch</text>
  <text start="129.539" dur="3.241">of people saying it&amp;#39;s been hacked it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.679" dur="3.091">been hacked but you can get root access</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="3.27">to the device but</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="4.56">I mean you can get the points anyone can</text>
  <text start="136.05" dur="3.33">get rid access a device it doesn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.33" dur="3.18">not the same thing and technically</text>
  <text start="139.38" dur="4.44">speaking it doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything no one</text>
  <text start="141.51" dur="3.87">has gotten a single like even little</text>
  <text start="143.82" dur="3.48">Satoshi out of this thing which is like</text>
  <text start="145.38" dur="5.21">the point zero zero zero Bitcoin stuff</text>
  <text start="147.3" dur="6.75">that&amp;#39;s a Satoshi named after the creator</text>
  <text start="150.59" dur="5.41">Satoshi he also sends this little thing</text>
  <text start="154.05" dur="4.02">here which comes with it you know set up</text>
  <text start="156" dur="3.81">your secret phrase but but let&amp;#39;s open</text>
  <text start="158.07" dur="3.63">the device this is exciting</text>
  <text start="159.81" dur="4.26">alright now I don&amp;#39;t get to do too many</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="4.92">cool product reviews like this so I am</text>
  <text start="164.07" dur="5.52">interested that is nice isn&amp;#39;t it like</text>
  <text start="166.62" dur="4.62">man even if you like even if they get</text>
  <text start="169.59" dur="4.98">the device you can still save your your</text>
  <text start="171.24" dur="5.28">stuff so in theory I think it could be</text>
  <text start="174.57" dur="3.21">hacked if they can get the device and if</text>
  <text start="176.52" dur="2.88">they can do the thing that they need to</text>
  <text start="177.78" dur="3.48">do in and give it back to you before you</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="4.32">realize it&amp;#39;s gone I think that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="181.26" dur="6.12">only third oh my gosh are you kidding me</text>
  <text start="183.72" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s like a cell phone oh man I cannot</text>
  <text start="187.38" dur="4.59">wait to set this thing if I wish I had a</text>
  <text start="189.09" dur="5.04">lot of Bitcoin actually put on it but</text>
  <text start="191.97" dur="4.35">anyway this is so cool this is the</text>
  <text start="194.13" dur="3.63">unhackable wallet no one can take your</text>
  <text start="196.32" dur="3">money from you alright even the</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="3.09">government and you could put a billion</text>
  <text start="199.32" dur="4.86">dollars on this thing and no one could</text>
  <text start="200.85" dur="5.609">take it from you without you agreeing to</text>
  <text start="204.18" dur="4.08">it voluntarily and you should know there</text>
  <text start="206.459" dur="3.481">are things where you owe money and you</text>
  <text start="208.26" dur="4.83">should pay like if you owe a legitimate</text>
  <text start="209.94" dur="5.1">debt pay it but you should have the</text>
  <text start="213.09" dur="3.9">choice right you should always be able</text>
  <text start="215.04" dur="3.78">to have the choice and that is one of</text>
  <text start="216.99" dur="3.78">the things that I love most about crypto</text>
  <text start="218.82" dur="3.57">not to mention that it you know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="220.77" dur="3.63">deflationary currency it&amp;#39;s worth more in</text>
  <text start="222.39" dur="4.14">ten years than it is today and the</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="3.54">dollar will pay for about ten percent as</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="4.2">much in ten years as it will today you</text>
  <text start="227.94" dur="5.7">know so you ever heard the double the</text>
  <text start="230.73" dur="4.95">money money buys half you know half as</text>
  <text start="233.64" dur="3.42">much or so every ten years or something</text>
  <text start="235.68" dur="3.9">like that I don&amp;#39;t know the expression</text>
  <text start="237.06" dur="4.77">but because I don&amp;#39;t talk to people but I</text>
  <text start="239.58" dur="5.64">have heard them you know something like</text>
  <text start="241.83" dur="5.7">that I spent years though so this is</text>
  <text start="245.22" dur="5.79">really neat I like it it runs off of a</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="7.32">five volt max battery see this is so</text>
  <text start="251.01" dur="5.67">cool yeah this is very more charge him</text>
  <text start="254.85" dur="4.109">so I just wanted to mention this thing</text>
  <text start="256.68" dur="4.89">this is so cool these things by the way</text>
  <text start="258.959" dur="5.101">John McAfee is I talk good stuff about</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="4.83">him because he is a techno guru</text>
  <text start="264.06" dur="5.13">maverick you know he joked realm called</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="5.58">himself like was it the god of of</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="5.19">computer security or something and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.98" dur="4.08">not involved in the McAfee Antivirus</text>
  <text start="274.38" dur="5.43">anymore he says it&amp;#39;s now by the way</text>
  <text start="276.06" dur="5.52">but he&amp;#39;s letting these things go which</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="4.62">are the unhackable this is the best of</text>
  <text start="281.58" dur="4.23">the of the industry right now as far as</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="3.09">wallets go I&amp;#39;m sure other people will</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="3.21">make them now but the other ones that</text>
  <text start="287.52" dur="5.28">are out there like 1200 bucks</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="5.13">these things are like 130 alright so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="292.8" dur="2.7">always bringing you guys useful</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="2.82">information I know many of you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="295.5" dur="2.82">care about Bitcoin I know many of you</text>
  <text start="296.97" dur="4.259">don&amp;#39;t care about Kryptos I think you</text>
  <text start="298.32" dur="4.89">will in the future because I think with</text>
  <text start="301.229" dur="4.41">with the with the manipulation with gold</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="5.75">and silver you know I&amp;#39;m a silver guy</text>
  <text start="305.639" dur="6.09">I&amp;#39;ve gotten my silver bar right there</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="5.92">but you know I have I have some silver</text>
  <text start="311.729" dur="5.221">bars in a barter situation or a you know</text>
  <text start="314.88" dur="4.349">a grid down situation god forbid we have</text>
  <text start="316.95" dur="4.56">like a solar flare or an EMP weapon go</text>
  <text start="319.229" dur="4.561">off we&amp;#39;re very susceptible to that but</text>
  <text start="321.51" dur="4.35">my thoughts on that really like if we</text>
  <text start="323.79" dur="4.32">have an EMP go off I do have some barter</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="4.44">stuff but at the same point you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="328.11" dur="4.14">to be trying to survive like the whole</text>
  <text start="330.3" dur="5.54">system will fall apart we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="5.43">facing like like very fragile</text>
  <text start="335.84" dur="4.06">transportation and food distribution</text>
  <text start="337.68" dur="4.41">systems so you know there will be mass</text>
  <text start="339.9" dur="4.86">starvation and in that situation you</text>
  <text start="342.09" dur="4.199">won&amp;#39;t need to worry about stuff so much</text>
  <text start="344.76" dur="3.57">you will need to worry about survival</text>
  <text start="346.289" dur="4.351">while everyone else is trying to is</text>
  <text start="348.33" dur="3.36">hungry all right and then after they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.64" dur="2.49">all starving to death</text>
  <text start="351.69" dur="2.789">stuff will be laying everywhere that no</text>
  <text start="353.13" dur="3.9">one owns so you don&amp;#39;t really have to</text>
  <text start="354.479" dur="3.991">worry about stuff you need to have the</text>
  <text start="357.03" dur="3.12">things that you need to survive for a</text>
  <text start="358.47" dur="4.38">couple months while you just kind of</text>
  <text start="360.15" dur="4.23">holed up somewhere and wait until the</text>
  <text start="362.85" dur="3.03">Internet is reestablished so that is</text>
  <text start="364.38" dur="2.61">yeah that&amp;#39;s the biggest thing that I get</text>
  <text start="365.88" dur="3.24">from people like what do you do if the</text>
  <text start="366.99" dur="4.11">internet goes down well I first of all I</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="3.45">don&amp;#39;t live my life under the assumption</text>
  <text start="371.1" dur="2.64">and I don&amp;#39;t make my investment decisions</text>
  <text start="372.57" dur="2.34">under the assumption that the Internet</text>
  <text start="373.74" dur="3.149">is gonna go down because I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="374.91" dur="4.04">it&amp;#39;s gonna happen in the unlikely event</text>
  <text start="376.889" dur="4.261">that we go to some sort of an EMP war</text>
  <text start="378.95" dur="3.339">then you know there are things that you</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="3">could do to protect yourself there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.289" dur="4.021">Faridah Faraday cages or whatever that</text>
  <text start="384.15" dur="5.16">could probably protect your your wallet</text>
  <text start="386.31" dur="4.41">here from an EMP however you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="389.31" dur="3.18">you if you lose the wallet you can</text>
  <text start="390.72" dur="5.25">actually reclaim your money and store it</text>
  <text start="392.49" dur="5.46">in your brain so you know one can take</text>
  <text start="395.97" dur="6.99">it from you like I said</text>
  <text start="397.95" dur="8.22">now that said a couple of other points</text>
  <text start="402.96" dur="4.74">that I want to make about Kryptos some</text>
  <text start="406.17" dur="3.33">of the other arguments that I hear like</text>
  <text start="407.7" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s backed by nothing but faith Oh blah</text>
  <text start="409.5" dur="6.09">blah well that same statement can be</text>
  <text start="411.99" dur="6.96">said of the dollar or gold right it is</text>
  <text start="415.59" dur="5.94">it is the it is the it is not being</text>
  <text start="418.95" dur="4.56">backed by trust that&amp;#39;s the weakness it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="421.53" dur="3.78">the trustworthiness</text>
  <text start="423.51" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s the weakness okay the dollar has</text>
  <text start="425.31" dur="4.35">no trustworthiness because it&amp;#39;s backed</text>
  <text start="427.17" dur="4.38">by confidence and faith in the</text>
  <text start="429.66" dur="4.23">government and who has faith in the</text>
  <text start="431.55" dur="3.42">government right if you trust the</text>
  <text start="433.89" dur="4.35">government you</text>
  <text start="434.97" dur="7.08">well fool and his money or are not gonna</text>
  <text start="438.24" dur="7.62">be together for very long right and as</text>
  <text start="442.05" dur="5.34">far as trust systems go you know many</text>
  <text start="445.86" dur="4.29">people trust gold and silver that will</text>
  <text start="447.39" dur="4.92">always have some value but I like crypto</text>
  <text start="450.15" dur="4.47">because it&amp;#39;s a trustless system all</text>
  <text start="452.31" dur="4.59">right it&amp;#39;s based on mathematics it yes</text>
  <text start="454.62" dur="4.98">Bitcoin has the same kind of scarcity in</text>
  <text start="456.9" dur="4.29">fact more scarce than gold there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="459.6" dur="4.35">even enough that coin for every</text>
  <text start="461.19" dur="4.02">millionaire in the planet to have one do</text>
  <text start="463.95" dur="4.23">you understand what that means</text>
  <text start="465.21" dur="5.04">and the cost to to actually mine and</text>
  <text start="468.18" dur="3.63">create these things it&amp;#39;s thousands of</text>
  <text start="470.25" dur="5.67">dollars of electricity so there is a</text>
  <text start="471.81" dur="6.33">cost and you know that is a small price</text>
  <text start="475.92" dur="3.48">to pay we&amp;#39;re already using like 3% of</text>
  <text start="478.14" dur="2.67">the world&amp;#39;s electricity to mine these</text>
  <text start="479.4" dur="3.81">things but that is a small price to pay</text>
  <text start="480.81" dur="6.24">for an honest money system which will</text>
  <text start="483.21" dur="7.08">set set us free economically and create</text>
  <text start="487.05" dur="5.07">such prosperity and and you know rising</text>
  <text start="490.29" dur="3.12">tide lifts all boats the poorest among</text>
  <text start="492.12" dur="6.57">us will benefit the most</text>
  <text start="493.41" dur="7.38">so bitcoin is is the Internet of money</text>
  <text start="498.69" dur="3.48">you know the internet of the way</text>
  <text start="500.79" dur="2.22">internet changed the information you</text>
  <text start="502.17" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t have to go to the local library</text>
  <text start="503.01" dur="5.13">anymore travel around the country</text>
  <text start="505.89" dur="5.1">you know scroll through old newspapers</text>
  <text start="508.14" dur="4.589">well Bitcoin or other crypto is I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="510.99" dur="3.06">know which one will win bitcoins the</text>
  <text start="512.729" dur="2.911">biggest for now but it&amp;#39;s losing market</text>
  <text start="514.05" dur="2.94">share and I talk about some of the other</text>
  <text start="515.64" dur="2.67">ones as well and you know if you guys</text>
  <text start="516.99" dur="4.79">want me to do more of that I would love</text>
  <text start="518.31" dur="5.79">to do so however</text>
  <text start="521.78" dur="4.54">kryptos are not going anywhere they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.1" dur="4.86">in their infancy I mean imagine compare</text>
  <text start="526.32" dur="4.59">the internet back you guys remember back</text>

  <text start="760.24" dur="3.48">beautiful thing about this is is if they</text>
  <text start="762.01" dur="3.93">can bash it if they can break Bitcoin if</text>
  <text start="763.72" dur="4.11">they could bash down Bitcoin a thousand</text>

  <text start="781.15" dur="5.76">are competing do you see how beautiful</text>
  <text start="783.64" dur="5.94">that is like imagine the DMV no</text>
  <text start="786.91" dur="5.01">competition alright imagine the local PD</text>
  <text start="789.58" dur="3.81">no competition now look at the</text>
  <text start="791.92" dur="3.15">corruption look at the service look at</text>
  <text start="793.39" dur="2.699">the lack of service the lack of quality</text>
  <text start="795.07" dur="2.8">the expense</text>
  <text start="796.089" dur="4.031">now imagine fast</text>
  <text start="797.87" dur="3.96">food or cellphones look at the</text>
  <text start="800.12" dur="4.26">competition factor that competition</text>
  <text start="801.83" dur="5.28">factor lowers the price it&amp;#39;s super cheap</text>
  <text start="804.38" dur="5.04">all right and raises equality like</text>
  <text start="807.11" dur="4.46">doubles it every every well not in case</text>
  <text start="809.42" dur="4.26">of fast food but it they try right</text>
  <text start="811.57" dur="5.37">compared to each other at least it</text>
  <text start="813.68" dur="5.88">raises the quality look at cell phones</text>
  <text start="816.94" dur="7.03">exponentially right like they get faster</text>
  <text start="819.56" dur="6.42">smaller better more invasive but you</text>
  <text start="823.97" dur="3.27">know we have you know just like just</text>
  <text start="825.98" dur="3.45">like Mac if he gave us the bit fee</text>

  <text start="904.22" dur="2.85">currencies not all of them are good all</text>
  <text start="905.9" dur="3.75">right you have to you have to be</text>
  <text start="907.07" dur="4.65">discerning all right and we talked about</text>
  <text start="909.65" dur="3.75">this but I wish I could talk about</text>
  <text start="911.72" dur="3.18">crypto is more my audience you know</text>
  <text start="913.4" dur="2.879">they&amp;#39;re mostly older and they they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="914.9" dur="2.73">they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t care too much for</text>
  <text start="916.279" dur="2.731">cryptos and that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="917.63" dur="3.329">gold and silver are still good options</text>

  <text start="922.37" dur="4.07">that&amp;#39;s stuff ain&amp;#39;t going anywhere</text>
  <text start="923.93" dur="4.89">right that price Inc going up until</text>
  <text start="926.44" dur="4.06">until the system collapses alright</text>
  <text start="928.82" dur="2.879">because every time look at the price of</text>
  <text start="930.5" dur="3.029">silver it went up - back</text>
  <text start="931.699" dur="4.531">50 bucks one time and I was so excited</text>
  <text start="933.529" dur="5.31">and then it crashed back down to its</text>
  <text start="936.23" dur="4.949">1913 prices just like now basically</text>
  <text start="938.839" dur="5.46">where it&amp;#39;s it stays there 16 bucks an</text>
  <text start="941.179" dur="5.94">ounce or so why well it&amp;#39;s very simple</text>
  <text start="944.299" dur="4.89">they have ETFs these ETFs hold like 1%</text>
  <text start="947.119" dur="4.32">or less if the physical silver and gold</text>
  <text start="949.189" dur="5.07">for the actual amount that they sell you</text>
  <text start="951.439" dur="5.851">on paper so if you have paper gold and</text>
  <text start="954.259" dur="5.31">silver and you expect to ever get it you</text>
  <text start="957.29" dur="3.659">are screwed like only the 1% of people</text>
  <text start="959.569" dur="3.56">that first try to get it will actually</text>
  <text start="960.949" dur="4.591">get anything okay it will just disappear</text>
  <text start="963.129" dur="4.06">overnight and the people that will</text>
  <text start="965.54" dur="3.509">benefit from that disappearing wealth</text>
  <text start="967.189" dur="4.77">all of those people that lost out all of</text>

  <text start="971.959" dur="4.021">that&amp;#39;s gonna just shrink back down into</text>
  <text start="973.669" dur="5.61">that 1% of actual gold and we will have</text>
  <text start="975.98" dur="4.769">a currency revaluation versus gold and</text>
  <text start="979.279" dur="3.571">silver just like in Venezuela when they</text>
