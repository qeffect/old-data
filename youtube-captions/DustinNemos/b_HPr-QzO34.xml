  <text start="357.249" dur="3.181">dinner</text>
  <text start="357.55" dur="5.009">a republic is what protects a minority</text>
  <text start="360.43" dur="4.739">even a minority of one the individual</text>
  <text start="362.559" dur="5.7">which is a free person a sovereign</text>
  <text start="365.169" dur="5.04">citizen that&amp;#39;s exactly what the minority</text>
  <text start="368.259" dur="3.541">heads at the end of the day and the</text>
  <text start="370.209" dur="3.871">Republic was designed to protect the</text>
  <text start="371.8" dur="5.849">greatest minority of all as Aymond</text>
  <text start="374.08" dur="5.399">said and that was the individual so if</text>
  <text start="377.649" dur="4.56">you want to have your rights protected</text>
  <text start="379.479" dur="6.06">you need a republic if you want to have</text>
  <text start="382.209" dur="5.01">your rights voted on by a large group of</text>
  <text start="385.539" dur="3.12">people whose interests are their own or</text>
  <text start="387.219" dur="3.69">their own groups and not yours</text>
  <text start="388.659" dur="3.72">necessarily then you have to engage in</text>
  <text start="390.909" dur="4.021">the world in a different way you have to</text>
  <text start="392.379" dur="4.68">start organizing groups and you have to</text>
  <text start="394.93" dur="3.599">get your own mob to compete with the</text>
  <text start="397.059" dur="3.9">other mobs and if you fail to do that</text>
  <text start="398.529" dur="4.14">the other mobs will be now we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="400.959" dur="3.75">this and how organized the left and the</text>
  <text start="402.669" dur="3.72">Marxist were and how they never punch</text>
  <text start="404.709" dur="3.721">left for a long time now they aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="406.389" dur="5.041">they&amp;#39;re turning on each other but they</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="5.039">would always sort of kind of coalesced</text>
  <text start="411.43" dur="5.609">against the common enemy which is the</text>
  <text start="413.469" dur="7.26">right and capitalism itself things like</text>
  <text start="417.039" dur="4.591">that sort of our way of life so you know</text>
  <text start="420.729" dur="3.301">they&amp;#39;re very good at that</text>
  <text start="421.63" dur="6.3">it&amp;#39;s gang warfare on a political sense</text>
  <text start="424.03" dur="7.68">with voting being the weapon voting and</text>
  <text start="427.93" dur="6.54">policies and you know instead of guns</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="4.8">for the most part and you know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="434.47" dur="3.9">a pleasant world to live in because a</text>
  <text start="436.51" dur="3.03">government is basically a hammer and</text>
  <text start="438.37" dur="3.54">then you have all these different groups</text>
  <text start="439.54" dur="4.17">competing for the government hammer to</text>
  <text start="441.91" dur="3.27">smash each other down you know the left</text>
  <text start="443.71" dur="3.9">is trying to get that hammer to hurt us</text>
  <text start="445.18" dur="4.92">right now and we are we are wielding the</text>
  <text start="447.61" dur="4.05">hammer with President Trump more ways</text>
  <text start="450.1" dur="3.36">than one for those who get the inside</text>
  <text start="451.66" dur="4.77">joke there of the cue movement stuff and</text>
  <text start="453.46" dur="6.42">the hammer but we&amp;#39;re wielding that that</text>
  <text start="456.43" dur="6.27">political hammer now to smash down some</text>
  <text start="459.88" dur="5.13">pretty gross and unfair and evil</text>
  <text start="462.7" dur="4.68">practices I would say from the left and</text>
  <text start="465.01" dur="4.08">how far they had gotten in using the</text>
  <text start="467.38" dur="3.21">hammer against us right they had been</text>
  <text start="469.09" dur="3.72">using government power and state power</text>
  <text start="470.59" dur="5.28">against us the free people like the IRS</text>
  <text start="472.81" dur="5.94">like the FBI like the FISA courts spying</text>
  <text start="475.87" dur="5.13">on us whose non-stop even our presidents</text>
  <text start="478.75" dur="4.98">so of course we know that it&amp;#39;s a hammer</text>
  <text start="481" dur="4.89">and I think President Trump is in a</text>
  <text start="483.73" dur="3.9">sense weakening the hammer overall long</text>
  <text start="485.89" dur="3.12">term because you know one trust the</text>
  <text start="487.63" dur="3.87">media anymore that&amp;#39;s part of it no one</text>
  <text start="489.01" dur="4.35">trusts the intelligence deep state</text>
  <text start="491.5" dur="3.96">anymore that&amp;#39;s certainly part of it no</text>
  <text start="493.36" dur="5.31">one trusted justice system anymore</text>
  <text start="495.46" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s a clue clearly a part of it and</text>
  <text start="498.67" dur="4.32">who entrust the left-knee more or most</text>
  <text start="500.53" dur="4.2">of the old Republican so you know it for</text>
  <text start="502.99" dur="5.07">the most part he&amp;#39;s broken down the</text>
  <text start="504.73" dur="6.33">institutions of power and you most</text>
  <text start="508.06" dur="6.03">clearly see that in the fake news they</text>
  <text start="511.06" dur="7.56">are ridiculed scorned and distrusted by</text>
  <text start="514.09" dur="7.17">almost everyone now so continuing on we</text>
  <text start="518.62" dur="5.34">also have impeachment the speech Nancy</text>
  <text start="521.26" dur="6.72">Pelosi wished she never gave this is a</text>
  <text start="523.96" dur="6.66">really good clip it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very much on</text>
  <text start="527.98" dur="4.68">spot I guess I don&amp;#39;t have a weighted</text>
  <text start="530.62" dur="4.47">this is the best way all right here we</text>
  <text start="532.66" dur="4.47">go I want you guys to see this because</text>
  <text start="535.09" dur="3.6">you can totally use her own words</text>
  <text start="537.13" dur="4.38">against her in this instance of course</text>
  <text start="538.69" dur="4.92">there we go see thank you today the</text>
  <text start="541.51" dur="4.86">Republican majority is not judging the</text>
  <text start="543.61" dur="5.55">present with president with fairness but</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="4.23">impeaching him with a vengeance and the</text>
  <text start="549.16" dur="3.39">investigation of the president</text>
  <text start="550.6" dur="3.27">fundamental principles which Americans</text>
  <text start="552.55" dur="4.5">hold dear</text>
  <text start="553.87" dur="6.35">privacy fairness checks and balances</text>
  <text start="557.05" dur="6.51">have been seriously violated and why</text>
  <text start="560.22" dur="5.8">because we are here as we are here today</text>
  <text start="563.56" dur="5.25">because the Republicans in the House are</text>
  <text start="566.02" dur="4.98">paralyzed with hatred of President</text>
  <text start="568.81" dur="4.35">Clinton and until the Republicans free</text>
  <text start="571" dur="2.94">themselves of this hatred our country</text>
  <text start="573.16" dur="3.6">will suffer</text>
  <text start="573.94" dur="5.19">I rise to want to oppose these unfair</text>

  <text start="579.13" dur="3.72">the President of the United States from</text>
  <text start="580.51" dur="4.11">office and in doing so wish to point out</text>
  <text start="582.85" dur="3.72">some differences between the</text>

  <text start="1710.42" dur="6.87">know sanctions were war sanctions or an</text>
  <text start="1713.75" dur="5.73">act of war sanctions are someone putting</text>

  <text start="2045.32" dur="4.319">know and maybe you maybe you remember</text>
  <text start="2046.88" dur="5.94">the white hat movement came from a guy</text>

  <text start="2052.82" dur="3.93">admit this fine he&amp;#39;s nobody not on</text>

  <text start="2058.399" dur="5.611">a patriot but you know no one knows him</text>
  <text start="2061.49" dur="4.429">and he had this great idea to create a</text>
  <text start="2064.01" dur="4.68">movement of white hats of good guys and</text>
  <text start="2065.919" dur="4.681">he he kind of passed that torch to mean</text>
  <text start="2068.69" dur="3.41">to continue that sense</text>
  <text start="2070.6" dur="3.42">you know I have somewhat of a public</text>
  <text start="2072.1" dur="4.23">image and I&amp;#39;m not there getting the word</text>
  <text start="2074.02" dur="4.32">out about things and the way that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2076.33" dur="3.81">taken that that white hat movement and I</text>
  <text start="2078.34" dur="5.73">that I see they could do the best in the</text>
  <text start="2080.14" dur="6.27">world in terms of doing good is to come</text>
  <text start="2084.07" dur="5.01">behind all of the white hats into a new</text>
  <text start="2086.41" dur="5.52">sort of system and that means we could</text>
  <text start="2089.08" dur="5.52">have a marketplace or like apps to</text>
  <text start="2091.93" dur="4.26">support white hat owned companies and</text>
  <text start="2094.6" dur="3.51">you know why hat is a good guys that</text>
  <text start="2096.19" dur="3.87">support free speech so you could have</text>
  <text start="2098.11" dur="4.41">good guy companies that support free</text>
  <text start="2100.06" dur="4.41">speech and are good guy audiences that</text>
  <text start="2102.52" dur="4.38">support free speech going through the</text>
  <text start="2104.47" dur="4.2">good guy media that desperately need</text>
  <text start="2106.9" dur="3.9">funding because we&amp;#39;ve been D monetized</text>
  <text start="2108.67" dur="4.56">and caught off so this is a way for us</text>
  <text start="2110.8" dur="4.47">to advertise on our channels again after</text>
  <text start="2113.23" dur="4.41">YouTube has cut us off and eliminated us</text>
  <text start="2115.27" dur="3.84">from all of the other options and after</text>
  <text start="2117.64" dur="3.39">the others in some cases that even</text>
  <text start="2119.11" dur="3.84">eliminate bank accounts all right I</text>
  <text start="2121.03" dur="3.72">forgot got a call Laura Loomer and ask</text>
  <text start="2122.95" dur="3.12">her about this as well because I told</text>
  <text start="2124.75" dur="3.21">her I would and I told her about the bit</text>
  <text start="2126.07" dur="3.48">burning concept after I get off the</text>
  <text start="2127.96" dur="4.02">phone or after get off the video with</text>
  <text start="2129.55" dur="5.28">you guys but you know this is important</text>
  <text start="2131.98" dur="3.66">and and we have an opportunity to do</text>
  <text start="2134.83" dur="3.69">something about it</text>
  <text start="2135.64" dur="4.11">so yes it&amp;#39;s not that for anything is</text>
  <text start="2138.52" dur="2.55">very important but the white hat</text>
  <text start="2139.75" dur="3.42">movement is equally important because</text>
  <text start="2141.07" dur="5.01">one is an attack on censorship itself</text>
  <text start="2143.17" dur="4.53">and one is a reinforcements supply lines</text>
  <text start="2146.08" dur="3.48">to the people that are out there</text>
  <text start="2147.7" dur="4.65">fighting on the front lines and in many</text>
  <text start="2149.56" dur="4.47">cases taking risks in a laurel Oster</text>
  <text start="2152.35" dur="3.84">bank account and of course she&amp;#39;s been</text>

  <text start="2158.35" dur="4.92">entire MSM media at this point myself</text>
  <text start="2160.44" dur="5.2">things like that so of course these</text>
  <text start="2163.27" dur="4.26">people also take the risk of maybe never</text>
  <text start="2165.64" dur="3.78">being able to get jobs again in the</text>
  <text start="2167.53" dur="3.48">leftist world if we lose this fight I</text>
  <text start="2169.42" dur="5.07">mean there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of going into</text>
