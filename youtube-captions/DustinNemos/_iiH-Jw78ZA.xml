  <text start="218.31" dur="6.14">a cool guy he works really hard to put</text>
  <text start="221.97" dur="2.48">the truth out</text>
  <text start="228.65" dur="6">yes it is hominid I mean technically in</text>
  <text start="232.489" dur="5.041">theory if you run a political campaign</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="4.35">you should not have to pay for it</text>
  <text start="237.53" dur="3.45">yourself right you should do fundraising</text>
  <text start="239" dur="3.66">and then that should it&amp;#39;s all part of</text>
  <text start="240.98" dur="3">the process like starting a business you</text>
  <text start="242.66" dur="6.87">know you take out a loan</text>
  <text start="243.98" dur="9.06">but since the opponent I guess in this</text>
  <text start="249.53" dur="6.84">case has a much stronger local ground</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="5.819">game himself and I have a stronger</text>
  <text start="256.37" dur="4.53">internet ground game it would be really</text>
  <text start="258.859" dur="3.661">kind of interesting race honestly</text>
  <text start="260.9" dur="3.45">especially given that he&amp;#39;s kind of the</text>
  <text start="262.52" dur="11.28">old-style Republican and I&amp;#39;m sort of the</text>
  <text start="264.35" dur="11.7">new Trump era Republican okay well</text>

  <text start="276.05" dur="5.25">people keep getting unsubscribed I know</text>
  <text start="277.7" dur="5.18">that happens a lot too and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="281.3" dur="4.14">irritating</text>
  <text start="282.88" dur="4.45">yeah Greggy I could win right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.44" dur="4.199">that&amp;#39;s crazy and Laura Loomer actually</text>
  <text start="287.33" dur="4.89">is doing it down here in Florida and</text>
  <text start="289.639" dur="7.321">she&amp;#39;s raised a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="292.22" dur="6.75">thousand dollars so but I just want to</text>
  <text start="296.96" dur="4.17">drain the swamp you know I think I could</text>
  <text start="298.97" dur="3.9">I could go in there and and YouTube</text>
  <text start="301.13" dur="3.87">about my experiences in Congress</text>
  <text start="302.87" dur="7.5">afterwards and bring some light to the</text>
  <text start="305" dur="9.68">darkness a little bit yeah I asked Laura</text>
  <text start="310.37" dur="4.31">about it I need to I need to call back</text>
  <text start="316" dur="6.07">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people to followup with</text>
  <text start="318.26" dur="5.85">right now actually because of the stop</text>
  <text start="322.07" dur="5.13">bit burning campaign if you guys have</text>
  <text start="324.11" dur="5.73">been paying attention to that trying to</text>
  <text start="327.2" dur="4.68">end censorship Katie Hill was able to</text>
  <text start="329.84" dur="2.87">get into Congress you could yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.88" dur="8.61">funny</text>
  <text start="332.71" dur="10.179">true Jason the Great Awakening asks her</text>
  <text start="340.49" dur="4.859">good question how can subs have dropped</text>
  <text start="342.889" dur="6.75">just a couple F a couple thousand when Q</text>
  <text start="345.349" dur="6.661">is back doesn&amp;#39;t make sense are you</text>
  <text start="349.639" dur="4.081">talking about my subs specifically Jason</text>
  <text start="352.01" dur="4.83">because I&amp;#39;ve been frozen for nearly a</text>
  <text start="353.72" dur="6.12">year man so</text>
  <text start="356.84" dur="5.46">thing is I joke I&amp;#39;m the most censored</text>
  <text start="359.84" dur="3.78">channel on YouTube because I&amp;#39;m still on</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="3.78">YouTube so I haven&amp;#39;t been completely</text>
  <text start="363.62" dur="6.57">wiped out that on this channel I was on</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="7.13">my first channel but I&amp;#39;m frozen solid</text>
  <text start="370.19" dur="5.82">like negative even on my subscriptions</text>
  <text start="373.21" dur="5.41">for almost a year now I&amp;#39;ve been at 96</text>
  <text start="376.01" dur="5.37">thousand and losing every month so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="378.62" dur="9.079">down to 94 or maybe 93 by now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="381.38" dur="9.15">know vise ask what&amp;#39;s up with Q so Q is</text>
  <text start="387.699" dur="6.161">supposedly back and I&amp;#39;ll explain</text>
  <text start="390.53" dur="3.75">supposedly in a minute the trip code</text>
  <text start="393.86" dur="3.18">looks like</text>
  <text start="394.28" dur="5.25">it matches and it&amp;#39;s sort of carried over</text>
  <text start="397.04" dur="4.2">it looks like from the old website where</text>
  <text start="399.53" dur="4.98">the records sort of brought over to so</text>
  <text start="401.24" dur="5.81">you get see the old post I think so if</text>
  <text start="404.51" dur="5.159">that&amp;#39;s the case then in theory that is Q</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="4.42">however because it&amp;#39;s a new website who</text>
  <text start="409.669" dur="3.451">knows what happened halfway through here</text>
  <text start="411.47" dur="3.96">we still have to get the typical</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="5.79">traditional sort of proof from Trump</text>
  <text start="415.43" dur="5.489">himself so that&amp;#39;s how it works with Q so</text>
  <text start="418.91" dur="3.99">whenever there&amp;#39;s been a doubt or some</text>
  <text start="420.919" dur="5.281">sort of a break in the ownership of the</text>
  <text start="422.9" dur="5.25">chain you can say well we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="426.2" dur="4.77">that you&amp;#39;re really Q can you ask Trump</text>
  <text start="428.15" dur="5.19">to say something like tippy-top and then</text>
  <text start="430.97" dur="5.85">he will actually go and say it and prove</text>
  <text start="433.34" dur="6.03">it to us but yes 93 days of dark he came</text>
  <text start="436.82" dur="5.55">within about five minutes of that so he</text>
  <text start="439.37" dur="6.479">he was in the 93 days of dark so that</text>
  <text start="442.37" dur="5.49">made a lot of sense in retrospect so yes</text>
  <text start="445.849" dur="5.311">I do believe that that is Qi just wanted</text>
  <text start="447.86" dur="5.19">to make sure people are aware of the new</text>
  <text start="451.16" dur="11.43">wants there because technically it could</text>
  <text start="453.05" dur="11.85">still not be q d lemon says a layman and</text>
  <text start="462.59" dur="4.35">i could be butchering your name sorry</text>
  <text start="464.9" dur="4.38">name of us what do you think would</text>
  <text start="466.94" dur="4.83">happen if impeachment were to actualize</text>
  <text start="469.28" dur="4.02">I don&amp;#39;t think it would happen but in</text>
  <text start="471.77" dur="5.369">your perspective how would Patriots</text>
  <text start="473.3" dur="11.04">respond I genuinely believe it would be</text>
  <text start="477.139" dur="9.411">a civil war I really do absolutely this</text>
  <text start="484.34" dur="4.85">is clearly the the final straw and</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re clearly cheating</text>
  <text start="489.19" dur="3.93">out to get him the country would rally</text>
  <text start="490.84" dur="5.19">around him I think the country you&amp;#39;d see</text>
  <text start="493.12" dur="5.25">of a sea of bodies between him and them</text>
  <text start="496.03" dur="8.43">we would not let them get our president</text>
  <text start="498.37" dur="7.68">period and that may be what he comes to</text>
  <text start="504.46" dur="10.17">help do I doubt it though I really do</text>
  <text start="506.05" dur="11.31">doubt it and yeah you could say that</text>
  <text start="514.63" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;re sort of in a civil war technically</text>
  <text start="517.36" dur="3.51">now I mean it certainly there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="518.65" dur="6.48">lot of violence a political war</text>
  <text start="520.87" dur="7.44">certainly and the world itself is in a</text>
  <text start="525.13" dur="5.37">tense place you know we&amp;#39;re in a virtual</text>
  <text start="528.31" dur="3.84">hot war with China almost I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.5" dur="3.78">certainly an economic war it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.15" dur="4.26">turning into a currency war and the next</text>
  <text start="534.28" dur="4.11">thing on that slide is an actual hot war</text>
  <text start="536.41" dur="4.38">you know physical violence but hopefully</text>
  <text start="538.39" dur="3.93">that doesn&amp;#39;t happen either we really do</text>
  <text start="540.79" dur="3.84">need to solve the problems at home</text>
  <text start="542.32" dur="11.22">though because our greatest threat is</text>
  <text start="544.63" dur="10.98">not the Democrats it&amp;#39;s China I guy says</text>
  <text start="553.54" dur="4.08">and I appreciate you typing it in caps</text>
  <text start="555.61" dur="4.17">makes it easier for me to see do you</text>
  <text start="557.62" dur="4.5">think impeachment will be the black swan</text>
  <text start="559.78" dur="6.12">that finally kills the economy I like I</text>
  <text start="562.12" dur="8.94">use the Black Swan term um I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="565.9" dur="6.95">think that they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re playing a</text>
  <text start="571.06" dur="4.29">game now they want to kill the economy</text>
  <text start="572.85" dur="5.44">but they can&amp;#39;t because they know Trump</text>
  <text start="575.35" dur="5.07">is blaming it on the Fed so every time</text>
  <text start="578.29" dur="3.78">they do anything he sort of says the Fed</text>
  <text start="580.42" dur="3.9">the Fed he&amp;#39;s even made statement saying</text>
  <text start="582.07" dur="4.76">that the Fed are the real enemy not</text>
  <text start="584.32" dur="4.92">China and maybe that is the truth</text>
  <text start="586.83" dur="4.6">because you know the Fed the central</text>
  <text start="589.24" dur="5.52">bank the concept of the central bank is</text>
  <text start="591.43" dur="5.04">is more dangerous even than China but if</text>
  <text start="594.76" dur="4.71">we could get an honest currency system</text>
  <text start="596.47" dur="6.26">which q has also said gold standard or</text>
  <text start="599.47" dur="6.12">he said gold will kill the the Fed so</text>
  <text start="602.73" dur="5.23">you know I do also believe that as the</text>
  <text start="605.59" dur="4.8">currency there dies and we go to a gold</text>
  <text start="607.96" dur="4.29">standard there&amp;#39;s gonna be a war between</text>
  <text start="610.39" dur="3.75">sort of Trump and the Fed at some point</text>
  <text start="612.25" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s going to be blamed on the Fed we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="614.14" dur="6.02">gonna use that to pivot to something</text>
  <text start="616.33" dur="5.84">just unimaginable now the gold standard</text>
  <text start="620.16" dur="3.9">because the paper dollar is dying and</text>
  <text start="622.17" dur="3.99">you can&amp;#39;t go from fiat to fiat currency</text>
  <text start="624.06" dur="5.55">anyway it just doesn&amp;#39;t work so I do</text>
  <text start="626.16" dur="4.98">believe gold is coming I think that all</text>
  <text start="629.61" dur="2.97">of that is gonna happen on the second</text>
  <text start="631.14" dur="3.09">term I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="632.58" dur="3.96">allowed by Trump I think he has the</text>
  <text start="634.23" dur="5.97">power they&amp;#39;re not going to be allowed to</text>
  <text start="636.54" dur="5.67">tank the economy in the mean time and if</text>
  <text start="640.2" dur="6.9">they did it would probably just help him</text>
  <text start="642.21" dur="8.72">in some way because that&amp;#39;s our truck and</text>
  <text start="647.1" dur="6.42">yeah fortunately China is is</text>
  <text start="650.93" dur="4.27">economically teetering like they&amp;#39;re sort</text>
  <text start="653.52" dur="2.82">of they were used to a rigged game they</text>
  <text start="655.2" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t know how to do this on their own</text>
  <text start="656.34" dur="5.46">and and now economically speaking it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="658.8" dur="5.88">like really bad for them so what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="661.8" dur="5.4">seeing is the red dragon sort of rearing</text>
  <text start="664.68" dur="4.92">its its true form now instead of this</text>
  <text start="667.2" dur="4.2">panda bear and they&amp;#39;re starting to show</text>
  <text start="669.6" dur="4.5">up with a lot more violence on their own</text>
  <text start="671.4" dur="4.65">people there&amp;#39;s that whole thing from Xi</text>
  <text start="674.1" dur="4.77">Jinping about inheriting the red gene of</text>
  <text start="676.05" dur="4.8">communism which is nonsense they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="678.87" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re really enacting sort of full</text>
  <text start="680.85" dur="4.53">social and psychological controls over</text>
  <text start="683.19" dur="3.81">their people which is going to be</text>
  <text start="685.38" dur="2.43">necessary because their economy is going</text>
  <text start="687" dur="2.1">to go to crap</text>
  <text start="687.81" dur="5.34">and people are gonna be really unhappy</text>
  <text start="689.1" dur="6.24">with them but um people over there not</text>

  <text start="1736.4" dur="5.22">course you know at these exchanges where</text>

  <text start="1769.659" dur="5.161">that is having decentralized exchanges</text>

  <text start="1774.82" dur="7.709">are doing that now I guy says do you</text>
  <text start="1781" dur="7.11">think we will see gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1782.529" dur="7.89">confiscation I don&amp;#39;t want to say yes</text>
  <text start="1788.11" dur="4.26">because we have president Trump but</text>
  <text start="1790.419" dur="3.541">let&amp;#39;s be real here we&amp;#39;re going into a</text>
  <text start="1792.37" dur="4.35">situation where the government will be</text>

  <text start="1798.059" dur="7.09">because what else will government&amp;#39;s do</text>
  <text start="1800.35" dur="6.39">right so in theory absolutely we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1805.149" dur="5.601">gonna see confiscation especially of</text>
  <text start="1806.74" dur="7.319">gold because it&amp;#39;s difficult with silver</text>
  <text start="1810.75" dur="5.649">however there are ways around that -</text>
  <text start="1814.059" dur="6.211">Lynette saying as a friend of mine she</text>
  <text start="1816.399" dur="6.091">talks about using numismatic coins or</text>
  <text start="1820.27" dur="5.22">kind of like the low margin collectible</text>
  <text start="1822.49" dur="5.61">coins there is a bigger markup than just</text>
  <text start="1825.49" dur="4.26">a bullion coin but that&amp;#39;s how a lot of</text>
  <text start="1828.1" dur="4.38">the very wealthy people will hold their</text>
  <text start="1829.75" dur="4.32">their own money their own coins to hold</text>
  <text start="1832.48" dur="4.65">it in these sort of collectible so if</text>
  <text start="1834.07" dur="5.07">things are confiscated later or just</text>
  <text start="1837.13" dur="3.539">like if you&amp;#39;re trying to hide your money</text>
  <text start="1839.14" dur="2.759">or you&amp;#39;re trying to hide your gold and</text>
  <text start="1840.669" dur="3.181">silver because people are being</text>
  <text start="1841.899" dur="3.721">confiscated this is something that you</text>
  <text start="1843.85" dur="3.179">could still use openly this is something</text>
  <text start="1845.62" dur="3.96">that would have been legal to keep at</text>
  <text start="1847.029" dur="5.311">least through the last confiscation so</text>
  <text start="1849.58" dur="4.44">there are strategies right that do what</text>
  <text start="1852.34" dur="4.069">the smart people are doing is how she</text>

  <text start="2052.609" dur="5.76">still I can&amp;#39;t say that there is for sure</text>
  <text start="2055.46" dur="4.98">more silver available or more gold</text>
  <text start="2058.369" dur="5.49">available in silver but we know the</text>
  <text start="2060.44" dur="5.489">trends you you stack gold you use and</text>
  <text start="2063.859" dur="5.07">consume silver for industrial purposes</text>
  <text start="2065.929" dur="6.361">far faster so we&amp;#39;re actually using</text>
  <text start="2068.929" dur="4.68">silver faster than we can mine it and we</text>
  <text start="2072.29" dur="3.089">are hitting a point where there may</text>
  <text start="2073.609" dur="3.451">actually be more physical gold available</text>
  <text start="2075.379" dur="4.171">than there is silver it may actually be</text>
  <text start="2077.06" dur="4.17">that silver is more precious now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2079.55" dur="4.65">still far more available in the ground</text>
  <text start="2081.23" dur="3.99">right so it&amp;#39;s still like a 16 to 1 or so</text>
  <text start="2084.2" dur="4.189">ratio in the ground</text>
  <text start="2085.22" dur="7.13">so technically gold is more valuable but</text>
  <text start="2088.389" dur="8.941">that could change because of usage</text>
  <text start="2092.35" dur="4.98">silver has you know even medical usage</text>

  <text start="2691.55" dur="4.99">you know they just sort of make it up as</text>
  <text start="2694.05" dur="4.17">they go along sometimes when Trump has</text>
  <text start="2696.54" dur="6.18">the power to overturn something like</text>
  <text start="2698.22" dur="7.71">that he could do it then he will but he</text>
  <text start="2702.72" dur="5.869">has to choose his area to strike very</text>

  <text start="2887.76" dur="4.08">cue thing but it&amp;#39;s where we go when we</text>
  <text start="2889.35" dur="5.49">go all versus censorship right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2891.84" dur="5.67">what stopped it burning is about we have</text>
  <text start="2894.84" dur="6.69">the cue book which was a best seller on</text>
  <text start="2897.51" dur="5.61">Amazon like overnight because we did it</text>
  <text start="2901.53" dur="6.42">together where we go one who you all</text>
  <text start="2903.12" dur="6.6">pissed off Amazon in the media - and the</text>
  <text start="2907.95" dur="3.78">white hat movement for example for those</text>
  <text start="2909.72" dur="4.23">you know entrepreneurial types out there</text>
  <text start="2911.73" dur="4.11">like business owners and such if you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="2915.84" dur="4.59">freedom of speech and you want to sell</text>
  <text start="2917.52" dur="4.41">to our audiences online there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="2920.43" dur="4.17">us that are getting into this system now</text>
  <text start="2921.93" dur="4.32">as well so we&amp;#39;ll have a huge network in</text>

  <text start="2926.76" dur="4.32">we will then again have something to</text>
  <text start="2929.4" dur="4.98">advertise because YouTube took it away</text>
  <text start="2931.08" dur="5.88">from us and Patriots went where we go</text>

  <text start="2947.93" dur="5.65">that&amp;#39;s called the white hat movement so</text>
  <text start="2951.51" dur="3.87">synergistically like the the bit burning</text>
  <text start="2953.58" dur="3.57">thing is to take on censorship and the</text>
  <text start="2955.38" dur="4.05">white hat movement is to take on D</text>
  <text start="2957.15" dur="4.74">monetization because I&amp;#39;m tired of seeing</text>
