  <text start="7.34" dur="5.16">I survived the national security state</text>
  <text start="10.25" dur="3.809">due to my possession of critical</text>
  <text start="12.5" dur="2.94">evidence from the White House that would</text>
  <text start="14.059" dur="3.271">have exposed the truth one of the</text>
  <text start="15.44" dur="3.69">darkest moments of American history I</text>
  <text start="17.33" dur="4.35">was declared a national security threat</text>
  <text start="19.13" dur="4.889">and suffered years in federal prison</text>
  <text start="21.68" dur="4.95">although supported by certain presidents</text>
  <text start="24.019" dur="4.32">I was condemned by others terrible</text>
  <text start="26.63" dur="3.899">forces in the United States destroyed my</text>
  <text start="28.339" dur="3.811">life my friends and members of my family</text>

  <text start="51.89" dur="3.96">modern Patriots to find out what went</text>
  <text start="53.51" dur="7.7">wrong why our foundations are crumbling</text>
  <text start="55.85" dur="5.36">welcome to 1776 welcome to the fight</text>
  <text start="62.2" dur="6.489">even in the most remote places in</text>
  <text start="64.61" dur="6.27">America patriotism is alive its spirit</text>
  <text start="68.689" dur="5.161">is embodied by my next guest retired</text>
  <text start="70.88" dur="5.339">news anchor Don Clark Don ran for</text>
  <text start="73.85" dur="4.409">Secretary of State in 1984 and has</text>
  <text start="76.219" dur="4.83">interviewed individuals like Henry Cabot</text>
  <text start="78.259" dur="4.601">Lodge Ted Kennedy and President Gerald</text>
  <text start="81.049" dur="3.951">Ford</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="4.72">first of all I have to tell you Chris</text>
  <text start="85" dur="4.89">I&amp;#39;ve reported in settings all over the</text>
  <text start="87.58" dur="4.5">world that not in a setting like this</text>
  <text start="89.89" dur="4.86">this is unique here we are in the middle</text>
  <text start="92.08" dur="4.71">of the Mojave Desert and this is where</text>
  <text start="94.75" dur="4.38">just down the road at Edwards Air Force</text>
  <text start="96.79" dur="5.25">Base test pilots took us to the edge of</text>
  <text start="99.13" dur="5.19">our space and kept us at the lead in our</text>
  <text start="102.04" dur="4.65">military capability what a setting you</text>
  <text start="104.32" dur="5.13">chose and I know Chris that the flag</text>
  <text start="106.69" dur="5.46">you&amp;#39;ve planted behind us is the colonial</text>
  <text start="109.45" dur="5.25">flag taking us back to our origins and I</text>
  <text start="112.15" dur="4.32">think the spirit that founded this</text>
  <text start="114.7" dur="3.54">country is the spirit that can save this</text>
  <text start="116.47" dur="3.929">country I agree with you what can you</text>
  <text start="118.24" dur="3.87">tell us about your experience in the and</text>
  <text start="120.399" dur="4.261">the broadcasting fuel</text>
  <text start="122.11" dur="5.97">well you you&amp;#39;re asking about censorship</text>
  <text start="124.66" dur="5.849">and I think one of the greatest problems</text>
  <text start="128.08" dur="5.34">in that area in our media it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.509" dur="6.031">really Chris it&amp;#39;s self-censorship I mean</text>
  <text start="133.42" dur="7.8">you just a reporter just kind of gets to</text>
  <text start="136.54" dur="7.59">know what the producer will accept or</text>
  <text start="141.22" dur="4.62">not accept as one reporter says you know</text>
  <text start="144.13" dur="4.26">you just kind of figure out what sells</text>
  <text start="145.84" dur="7.17">and that&amp;#39;s what you report on and you</text>
  <text start="148.39" dur="7.68">ignore all the rest and so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.01" dur="5.699">one aspect that that you just don&amp;#39;t risk</text>
  <text start="156.07" dur="5.4">your standing in the newsroom by</text>
  <text start="158.709" dur="4.62">venturing into fields that you know the</text>
  <text start="161.47" dur="3.42">the news director doesn&amp;#39;t want so</text>
  <text start="163.329" dur="4.051">there&amp;#39;s a political correctness to all</text>
  <text start="164.89" dur="5.31">of that exactly right exactly right and</text>
  <text start="167.38" dur="5.94">I worked at for a time at the Boston</text>
  <text start="170.2" dur="6.03">Globe it was just a field of egos</text>
  <text start="173.32" dur="5.639">competing with one another and and a</text>
  <text start="176.23" dur="6.87">kind of a groupthink and you just know</text>
  <text start="178.959" dur="8.461">what&amp;#39;s off limits and so it&amp;#39;s that kind</text>
  <text start="183.1" dur="6.419">of cultural censorship I find that in my</text>
  <text start="187.42" dur="4.95">experience it&amp;#39;s been ego and greed and</text>
  <text start="189.519" dur="5.461">so many of these up endeavors that it</text>
  <text start="192.37" dur="4.14">really inhibits our greatest efforts</text>
  <text start="194.98" dur="3.72">effort from mankind and for the</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="5.16">betterment of all of us egos for sure</text>
  <text start="198.7" dur="5.97">and then we have to keep in mind what</text>
  <text start="201.67" dur="5.22">Bob Woodward and Bernstein discovered</text>
  <text start="204.67" dur="5.69">and reported on and you can find on</text>
  <text start="206.89" dur="5.16">Google is operation Mockingbird an</text>
  <text start="210.36" dur="4.51">operation Mockingbird</text>
  <text start="212.05" dur="6.26">was back during the post</text>
  <text start="214.87" dur="6.81">or Mira in which four hundred top</text>
  <text start="218.31" dur="6.28">American journalists were peddling the</text>
  <text start="221.68" dur="6.6">CIA line I mean they they were all</text>
  <text start="224.59" dur="5.34">because in the war it was patriotic to</text>
  <text start="228.28" dur="6">be with the government and they</text>
  <text start="229.93" dur="7.86">continued that afterward and and so they</text>
  <text start="234.28" dur="5.429">were peddling you know what the CIA one</text>
  <text start="237.79" dur="5.22">in the nation to here almost like</text>
  <text start="239.709" dur="4.92">Providence uh right exactly what well</text>
  <text start="243.01" dur="3.24">speaking of the CIA let&amp;#39;s talk a little</text>
  <text start="244.629" dur="4.08">bit about the the cabal that works</text>
  <text start="246.25" dur="3.81">within the CIA specifically that they</text>
  <text start="248.709" dur="3.691">have no allegiance to the United States</text>
  <text start="250.06" dur="4.17">that they are protectors of the global</text>
  <text start="252.4" dur="4.17">structure and as somebody in the CIA is</text>
  <text start="254.23" dur="4.68">actually defined it to me are called</text>
  <text start="256.57" dur="3.93">protectors of the realm currently in the</text>
  <text start="258.91" dur="3.72">United States we are not acting as a</text>
  <text start="260.5" dur="4.08">free democracy we are operating as a</text>
  <text start="262.63" dur="4.02">system of great for great wealth and</text>
  <text start="264.58" dur="3.78">power to a handful and an ever greater</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="5.16">poverty and slavery for the citizens of</text>
  <text start="268.36" dur="5.82">the world and they attack with our</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="3.87">foundations are because they need a weak</text>
  <text start="274.18" dur="3.45">America to hold power they attack our</text>
  <text start="275.68" dur="3.42">family our culture and then attacked us</text>
  <text start="277.63" dur="4.53">through media in Hollywood and they</text>
  <text start="279.1" dur="5.129">divide us against each other and to push</text>
  <text start="282.16" dur="3.99">us to a substance abuse and literally</text>
  <text start="284.229" dur="3.871">blame the American people on the people</text>
  <text start="286.15" dur="5.25">of the world for the problems that</text>
  <text start="288.1" dur="7.83">they&amp;#39;ve created to breed and empower and</text>
  <text start="291.4" dur="7.05">Annie&amp;#39;s elite ideas fake Wars false Wars</text>
  <text start="295.93" dur="5.22">false agendas and the President Kennedy</text>
  <text start="298.45" dur="4.74">and President Reagan wanted the</text>
  <text start="301.15" dur="4.079">well-being of the American people in the</text>
  <text start="303.19" dur="4.67">world but both of them were were given</text>
  <text start="305.229" dur="5.551">as examples President Kennedy was killed</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="4.6">publicly and every president that came</text>
  <text start="310.78" dur="3.27">after him was told to follow suit you</text>
  <text start="312.46" dur="3.179">can see what happens that when you get</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="3.089">out of hand and go against the structure</text>
  <text start="315.639" dur="3.511">and then of course President Reagan</text>
  <text start="317.139" dur="4.681">would had been shot at it early in his</text>
  <text start="319.15" dur="5.639">presidency to get him in line go back in</text>
  <text start="321.82" dur="5.43">our history and you see the creation of</text>
  <text start="324.789" dur="4.411">the Central Intelligence Agency right</text>
  <text start="327.25" dur="4.139">after the war and a National Security</text>
  <text start="329.2" dur="4.38">Act the Train Truman put together</text>
  <text start="331.389" dur="4.681">Truman later repented</text>
  <text start="333.58" dur="5.37">creating the CIA because it began to do</text>
  <text start="336.07" dur="5.22">what he called strange things rather</text>
  <text start="338.95" dur="6.14">than being a source of information it</text>
  <text start="341.29" dur="6.36">became a dark operational force</text>
  <text start="345.09" dur="5.47">operating outside the limits of the</text>
  <text start="347.65" dur="5.61">Constitution the the vision of the media</text>
  <text start="350.56" dur="5.4">and the oversight of the Congress it</text>
  <text start="353.26" dur="5.07">became just a rogue agency and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="355.96" dur="3.84">operated much that way ever since and my</text>
  <text start="358.33" dur="3.33">personal experience is listening to the</text>
  <text start="359.8" dur="3.78">White House recordings that the</text>
  <text start="361.66" dur="4.38">president Kelly had made in 62 and 63</text>
  <text start="363.58" dur="3.69">specifically to try to get it to or keep</text>
  <text start="366.04" dur="4.47">people on record because it was so out</text>
  <text start="367.27" dur="4.97">of hand he was trying to gain control of</text>
  <text start="370.51" dur="5.16">the Central Intelligence Agency and</text>
  <text start="372.24" dur="5.32">replaced the head of the snake and they</text>
  <text start="375.67" dur="3.78">could not gain control over this agency</text>
  <text start="377.56" dur="3.42">he was trying to figure out who was the</text>
  <text start="379.45" dur="4.14">rogue elements what they were doing and</text>
  <text start="380.98" dur="4.38">he was so worried that these guys were</text>
  <text start="383.59" dur="3.84">going to take us on the agenda war and</text>
  <text start="385.36" dur="4.5">take us into an agenda World War three</text>
  <text start="387.43" dur="5.72">in turn I elation and that is the most</text>
  <text start="389.86" dur="7.5">important topic on earth peace</text>
  <text start="393.15" dur="5.44">the idea was simply that what do we do</text>
  <text start="397.36" dur="2.94">how do we defend ourselves against</text>
  <text start="398.59" dur="3.48">missiles that could come over here in 26</text>
  <text start="400.3" dur="3.11">minutes and if we can&amp;#39;t defend herself</text>
  <text start="402.07" dur="3.06">then we obviously have to strike first</text>
  <text start="403.41" dur="3.46">President Kennedy did everything he</text>
  <text start="405.13" dur="3.96">could to stop that from happening and it</text>
  <text start="406.87" dur="4.74">made us a peaceful world and he he gave</text>
  <text start="409.09" dur="5.1">his life for that but evil is not in</text>
  <text start="411.61" dur="4.59">most human nature it is not the majority</text>
  <text start="414.19" dur="4.56">of the world that is evil</text>
  <text start="416.2" dur="4.47">it is these specific individuals some</text>
  <text start="418.75" dur="3.66">individuals their nature is evil but but</text>
  <text start="420.67" dur="3.72">these evil people have have gained power</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="3.27">and wealth and through news and</text>
  <text start="424.39" dur="3.9">entertainment and banking in the White</text>
  <text start="425.68" dur="4.95">House and an audit goes they are now</text>
  <text start="428.29" dur="2.83">controlling the systems of the world and</text>
  <text start="430.63" dur="2.47">we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="431.12" dur="5.34">but I think there&amp;#39;s a great awakening</text>
  <text start="433.1" dur="4.92">happening through the social media and I</text>
  <text start="436.46" dur="3.48">think that people are starting to become</text>
  <text start="438.02" dur="3.899">aware and of course the NSA is keeping</text>
  <text start="439.94" dur="4.259">track of all of this information so they</text>
  <text start="441.919" dur="4.111">are able to see the covert actions of</text>
  <text start="444.199" dur="3.931">everyone including these criminals that</text>
  <text start="446.03" dur="4.77">are in power and so as this becomes</text>
  <text start="448.13" dur="5.27">public knowledge people are becoming</text>
  <text start="450.8" dur="6">awake to this idea but at the same time</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re desperately trying to control</text>
  <text start="456.8" dur="4.8">the Internet we have these algorithms</text>
  <text start="458.74" dur="5.95">within Facebook and Google and all the</text>
  <text start="461.6" dur="6.48">social we did well you you mentioned the</text>
  <text start="464.69" dur="5.07">internet and and the great service to</text>
  <text start="468.08" dur="4.74">democracy of the Internet as you</text>
  <text start="469.76" dur="5.129">bypassed the gatekeepers in my reporting</text>
  <text start="472.82" dur="4.08">years as I would actually produce</text>
  <text start="474.889" dur="4.201">television shows that I I would just</text>
  <text start="476.9" dur="5.04">scratch my head and puzzlement that</text>
  <text start="479.09" dur="5.25">there were so many topics that were not</text>
  <text start="481.94" dur="5.039">coming down the pipe but we&amp;#39;re not being</text>
  <text start="484.34" dur="6.03">sent down to the local stations and I I</text>
  <text start="486.979" dur="5.19">just I ain&amp;#39;t wished over again my first</text>
  <text start="490.37" dur="2.419">conclusion was they&amp;#39;re asleep at the</text>
  <text start="492.169" dur="2.731">switch</text>
  <text start="492.789" dur="3.761">they&amp;#39;re asleep at the switch up there</text>
  <text start="494.9" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re not reading they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="496.55" dur="4.2">paying attention to what&amp;#39;s happened in</text>
  <text start="498.5" dur="4.26">our country and then I finally realize</text>
  <text start="500.75" dur="4.74">no they&amp;#39;re not asleep at the switch</text>
  <text start="502.76" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re guarding the switch they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="505.49" dur="3.48">making sure that nothing comes down to</text>
  <text start="507.38" dur="4.23">the American people it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="508.97" dur="4.619">trouble that structure of power you</text>
  <text start="511.61" dur="4.169">talked about when somebody gains that</text>
  <text start="513.589" dur="4.561">power above the law and they are not</text>
  <text start="515.779" dur="3.841">there they&amp;#39;re above the law in ways that</text>
  <text start="518.15" dur="2.809">they can&amp;#39;t be prosecuted and they could</text>
  <text start="519.62" dur="4.049">do what they will and they have this a</text>
  <text start="520.959" dur="4.451">great addiction to it and the thing that</text>
  <text start="523.669" dur="3.961">scares and the most is losing that and</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;ll do anything they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="527.63" dur="3.959">operate in any way including killing</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="5.07">individuals or they get away with it to</text>
  <text start="531.589" dur="5.971">keep that power I do think that well</text>
  <text start="535.13" dur="5.459">people may not be inherently evil I</text>
  <text start="537.56" dur="6.27">think we all have a fallen nature and I</text>
  <text start="540.589" dur="6.451">think our founders people that started</text>
  <text start="543.83" dur="6.12">this country they were brutal realists</text>
  <text start="547.04" dur="6.78">they understood the fallen nature of man</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="6.81">and and for that reason the government</text>
  <text start="553.82" dur="6.36">that they created deliberately was to</text>
  <text start="556.76" dur="5.73">check that fallen nature that that they</text>
  <text start="560.18" dur="4.26">knew any structure of government they</text>
  <text start="562.49" dur="4.649">created no matter how perfect</text>
  <text start="564.44" dur="5.04">no matter how noble could be corrupted</text>
  <text start="567.139" dur="4.831">and turned instead of serving the people</text>
  <text start="569.48" dur="3.719">could be turned against the people so</text>
  <text start="571.97" dur="3.359">they built all these layers of</text>
  <text start="573.199" dur="3.541">government to check and balance one</text>
  <text start="575.329" dur="3.901">another not because they thought that</text>
  <text start="576.74" dur="6.269">was smart is because each one was a dam</text>
  <text start="579.23" dur="5.43">a bridge a barrier against the abuse</text>
  <text start="583.009" dur="3.901">that they know would happen and and</text>
  <text start="584.66" dur="4.38">what&amp;#39;s so interesting is you read the</text>
  <text start="586.91" dur="4.859">Declaration of Independence and within</text>
  <text start="589.04" dur="6.57">the first few paragraphs they are</text>
  <text start="591.769" dur="6.661">stating almost anticipating what has</text>
  <text start="595.61" dur="5.64">happened today and they&amp;#39;re saying when</text>
  <text start="598.43" dur="5.699">that happens when when government begins</text>
  <text start="601.25" dur="5.339">to abuse and usurp the rights of the</text>
  <text start="604.129" dur="5.7">people and begins to turn against those</text>
