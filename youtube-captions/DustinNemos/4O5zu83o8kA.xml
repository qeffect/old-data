  <text start="320.58" dur="3.96">that if Trump is out there saying good</text>
  <text start="322.95" dur="5.91">things about 5g it&amp;#39;s probably cuz he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.54" dur="6.63">about to destroy it honestly I know that</text>
  <text start="328.86" dur="4.01">there&amp;#39;s a lot of like abandon all hope</text>
  <text start="331.17" dur="3.45">Trump has betrayed us right now but</text>
  <text start="332.87" dur="3.76">seriously he&amp;#39;s just bringing attention</text>
  <text start="334.62" dur="4.08">to it so that probably so that the</text>
  <text start="336.63" dur="3.81">leftist left us can attack him for it so</text>
  <text start="338.7" dur="3.81">that he can then go back and then get</text>

  <text start="346.98" dur="4.77">only way to right now to get things</text>
  <text start="348.96" dur="4.89">through is to pretend he likes it make</text>
  <text start="351.75" dur="4.11">them hate it because it&amp;#39;s him and then</text>
  <text start="353.85" dur="4.68">decide that he doesn&amp;#39;t like as much and</text>
  <text start="355.86" dur="5.04">then everybody hates it so it makes</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="4.26">sense we&amp;#39;re playing a different game</text>
  <text start="360.9" dur="3.87">here it&amp;#39;s not just as simple as</text>
  <text start="362.79" dur="6.72">everything Trump says should be read at</text>
  <text start="364.77" dur="8.97">face value there are messages within</text>
