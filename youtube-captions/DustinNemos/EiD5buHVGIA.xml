  <text start="118.52" dur="4.44">gonna start off with Elizabeth Warren</text>
  <text start="120.289" dur="4.83">Pocahontas as you may remember caught in</text>
  <text start="122.96" dur="4.259">yet another lie I think this is like our</text>
  <text start="125.119" dur="4.351">third big public lie this time she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="127.219" dur="2.971">saying that her son went to public</text>
  <text start="129.47" dur="3.329">school</text>
  <text start="130.19" dur="5.909">and this is even caught on video as well</text>
  <text start="132.799" dur="6.151">because she clearly was trying to cater</text>
  <text start="136.099" dur="4.95">to or pander to a voter and just try to</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="3.96">to say whatever it was that would make</text>
  <text start="141.049" dur="3.961">this person like you at the time she&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="142.91" dur="5.37">psychopath and this is clear evidence of</text>
  <text start="145.01" dur="5.91">it I would as an on-site psychiatrist or</text>
  <text start="148.28" dur="4.679">psychologist I would posit my opinion</text>
  <text start="150.92" dur="4.95">that this is clear evidence but you know</text>
  <text start="152.959" dur="4.92">just to be safe look I think my opinion</text>
  <text start="155.87" dur="4.35">is that she may be a psychopath because</text>
  <text start="157.879" dur="5.551">of the the propensity and the the trend</text>
  <text start="160.22" dur="6.45">with her lies the fact that she does it</text>
  <text start="163.43" dur="4.169">so just Stone Cold Steve Austin style I</text>
  <text start="166.67" dur="2.819">mean she&amp;#39;ll just sit there and lie</text>
  <text start="167.599" dur="5.121">directly to your face without batting an</text>
  <text start="169.489" dur="3.231">eye let me show you</text>
  <text start="175.02" dur="3.93">we won&amp;#39;t we did we&amp;#39;d only have to find</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="4.52">choice that you make Bo kids because I</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="2.72">read the joke</text>
  <text start="183.05" dur="7.82">[Music]</text>
  <text start="188.709" dur="3.951">you hear that no my children went to</text>
  <text start="190.87" dur="4.979">public school she lied</text>
  <text start="192.66" dur="4.48">so continuing on and of course she lied</text>
  <text start="195.849" dur="3.931">our kids are not gonna go to a public</text>
  <text start="197.14" dur="5.099">school and get beaten like our children</text>
  <text start="199.78" dur="5.849">would which is what happens I mean most</text>
  <text start="202.239" dur="5.22">children in fact most people that will I</text>
  <text start="205.629" dur="3.301">think it was a statistic I read it</text>
  <text start="207.459" dur="4.89">recently a camera roll the details look</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="5.279">this up to vet me but most people do not</text>
  <text start="212.349" dur="3.39">experience the kind of violence that</text>
  <text start="214.209" dur="3.451">they would experience in high school in</text>
  <text start="215.739" dur="3.961">any other portion of their lives so some</text>
  <text start="217.66" dur="3.63">people yes in like the lower fringes of</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="3.36">society violence is gonna be with them</text>
  <text start="221.29" dur="3.9">their whole lives but for the most part</text>
  <text start="223.06" dur="5.28">people don&amp;#39;t have a lot of violent</text>
  <text start="225.19" dur="4.95">interactions outside of school because</text>
  <text start="228.34" dur="4.47">of course a lot of these children are</text>
  <text start="230.14" dur="4.86">already brain damaged and neglected</text>
  <text start="232.81" dur="3.84">because the society has brought us to</text>
  <text start="235" dur="4.41">that point where both parents have to be</text>
  <text start="236.65" dur="4.83">gone if they have enough luck to have</text>
  <text start="239.41" dur="3.45">two parents in the first place both</text>
  <text start="241.48" dur="2.759">parents have to be gone to earn money</text>
  <text start="242.86" dur="3.719">and then they go to the school and the</text>
  <text start="244.239" dur="5.491">school is a mark Marxist indoctrination</text>
  <text start="246.579" dur="7.13">camp of of sex Edie and fifty gingers</text>
  <text start="249.73" dur="6.659">and you know they get angry they get</text>
  <text start="253.709" dur="5.741">malnourished they because of today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.389" dur="4.711">farming and today&amp;#39;s standard American</text>
  <text start="259.45" dur="5.58">diet the sad diet that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.1" dur="5.85">called sad and it is a sad diet so they</text>
  <text start="265.03" dur="4.65">all of these different things coalesce</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="5.55">into this perfect storm of just terrible</text>
  <text start="269.68" dur="4.109">teenagers right doesn&amp;#39;t have to be that</text>
  <text start="272.5" dur="3.12">way there are schools where they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="273.789" dur="4.531">taken and they&amp;#39;ve switched to an organic</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="4.89">diet and the rate of these incidents</text>
  <text start="278.32" dur="4.77">goes to almost zero in fact the rate of</text>
  <text start="280.51" dur="5.82">all of the disciplinary incidents goes</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="4.77">to almost zero so it&amp;#39;s very closely tied</text>
  <text start="286.33" dur="3.75">to the food it&amp;#39;s very closely tied</text>
  <text start="287.86" dur="5.429">obviously to the culture to the parental</text>
  <text start="290.08" dur="5.309">bonds to the everything that&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="293.289" dur="4.171">and of course it&amp;#39;s not a surprise any</text>
  <text start="295.389" dur="3.9">and I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m bashing the school system</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="5.55">based on something else I&amp;#39;m going off on</text>
  <text start="299.289" dur="5.071">a bit of a rant here anyway but suffice</text>
  <text start="303.01" dur="3.839">to say they also won&amp;#39;t get the same</text>
  <text start="304.36" dur="4.02">level of education and that&amp;#39;s why you</text>
  <text start="306.849" dur="3.511">will never find someone like Elizabeth</text>
  <text start="308.38" dur="4.259">Warren putting her children in a public</text>
  <text start="310.36" dur="4.71">school now</text>
  <text start="312.639" dur="4.921">socialist crackpot that&amp;#39;s a good name</text>
  <text start="315.07" dur="4.529">for him Bernie Sanders is saying that he</text>
  <text start="317.56" dur="3.78">admitting that he will tax the poor and</text>
  <text start="319.599" dur="1.931">the middle class to fund Medicare for</text>
  <text start="321.34" dur="2.47">all</text>
  <text start="321.53" dur="4.05">and that includes illegal aliens so they</text>
  <text start="323.81" dur="4.38">want you to pay for Obamacare and they</text>
  <text start="325.58" dur="4.98">want you to pay for it for basically all</text>
  <text start="328.19" dur="4.02">of the world including all of the people</text>
  <text start="330.56" dur="4.2">that decide to come here and mooch off</text>
  <text start="332.21" dur="5.46">of us so this is for poor people even</text>
  <text start="334.76" dur="6.9">and he even talks about it another 4%</text>
  <text start="337.67" dur="6.06">tax on anyone over $29,000 look that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.66" dur="3.87">lower than the federal poverty rate for</text>
  <text start="343.73" dur="3.72">people that have a family so that</text>
  <text start="345.53" dur="3.54">already means that certain people who</text>
  <text start="347.45" dur="5.61">are barely making it are going to</text>
  <text start="349.07" dur="6.21">basically end up paying what they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="353.06" dur="4.47">afford probably going into debt if</text>
  <text start="355.28" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re you able to get that debt to</text>
  <text start="357.53" dur="4.05">support illegal aliens that are not</text>
  <text start="359.48" dur="3.81">paying into the system and should not</text>
  <text start="361.58" dur="3.75">benefit from the system and there should</text>
  <text start="363.29" dur="3.44">not be this system in fact because</text>
  <text start="365.33" dur="3.51">obviously it&amp;#39;s just being exploited</text>
  <text start="366.73" dur="3.67">anytime the government says we should do</text>
  <text start="368.84" dur="3.48">this for these people and help them out</text>
  <text start="370.4" dur="3.9">what they&amp;#39;re gonna really mean is that</text>
  <text start="372.32" dur="3.599">they&amp;#39;re gonna keep 80% of the money and</text>
  <text start="374.3" dur="3.33">then they&amp;#39;re going probably cause the</text>
  <text start="375.919" dur="3.781">problem in the first place you know is</text>
  <text start="377.63" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s basically what governments are it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="379.7" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s a big it&amp;#39;s a big crap fest of lies</text>
  <text start="383.18" dur="3.6">and deception and corruption and then</text>
  <text start="385.34" dur="3.12">they keep the money and then they give</text>
  <text start="386.78" dur="3.81">maybe 20 percent of it back they break</text>
  <text start="388.46" dur="4.2">your legs they sell you a wheelchair and</text>
  <text start="390.59" dur="3.9">then they tell you aren&amp;#39;t you fortunate</text>
  <text start="392.66" dur="4.91">enough that the government was here to</text>
  <text start="394.49" dur="6.57">protect you from being an able to walk</text>
  <text start="397.57" dur="5.98">man now we also have a Navy secretary</text>
  <text start="401.06" dur="4.32">Spencer okay so he was uh he was</text>
  <text start="403.55" dur="4.98">complaining he was he was allowed to</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="4.59">leave the Navy with full honors and</text>
  <text start="408.53" dur="4.68">everything and just kind of walk away</text>
  <text start="409.97" dur="5.31">after what he tried to do with Navy so</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="3.75">Gallagher I think it was so basically</text>
  <text start="415.28" dur="5.43">Eddie Gallagher Yap so what he tried to</text>
  <text start="416.96" dur="5.85">do was undermine Trump in direct</text>
  <text start="420.71" dur="4.68">opposition to his orders and tried to</text>
  <text start="422.81" dur="4.14">take away this seals rank despite</text>
  <text start="425.39" dur="3.839">everything that just happened and then</text>
  <text start="426.95" dur="4.68">he got caught lying about it and was</text>
  <text start="429.229" dur="4.311">actually at least allegedly here</text>
  <text start="431.63" dur="6.78">according to the source that&amp;#39;s in this</text>
  <text start="433.54" dur="6.939">from Jim Hoff here he says he was</text>
  <text start="438.41" dur="3.9">removed for quote dishonesty and</text>
  <text start="440.479" dur="5.281">undermining the military justice system</text>
  <text start="442.31" dur="6.72">and also quote lack of candor that means</text>
  <text start="445.76" dur="6.39">he lied now that means he was in a lot</text>
  <text start="449.03" dur="5.22">of trouble for lying and he was allowed</text>
  <text start="452.15" dur="2.65">to leave because if I guess his position</text>
  <text start="454.25" dur="2.47">and rank</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="4.019">he was allowed to keep his Trident pen</text>
  <text start="456.72" dur="5.909">as well which something he tried to deny</text>
  <text start="458.819" dur="6.991">to Navy SEAL Gallagher so this guy is</text>
  <text start="462.629" dur="6.481">now being exposed even more as I guess</text>
  <text start="465.81" dur="4.65">people look into him for his anti-trump</text>
  <text start="469.11" dur="3.39">rhetoric I mean this is what happens</text>
  <text start="470.46" dur="4.32">people start to dig into Trump&amp;#39;s enemies</text>
  <text start="472.5" dur="4.11">and they start to expose why they are</text>
  <text start="474.78" dur="4.859">Trump&amp;#39;s enemies and why they have it out</text>
  <text start="476.61" dur="5.01">to get them so in this case the guy was</text>
  <text start="479.639" dur="3.601">trying to undermine Trump in the</text>
  <text start="481.62" dur="6.09">military and was removed for it</text>
  <text start="483.24" dur="7.35">absolutely I mean when does it start to</text>
  <text start="487.71" dur="6.6">become treason right now he was</text>
  <text start="490.59" dur="6.24">graciously allowed to leave and resign</text>
  <text start="494.31" dur="5.13">now undercover female FBI agent</text>
  <text start="496.83" dur="5.1">apparently infiltrated al-qaeda and then</text>
  <text start="499.44" dur="4.62">FBI bosses terminated the top-secret</text>
  <text start="501.93" dur="4.68">operation and buried the key Intel</text>
  <text start="504.06" dur="5.159">before 9/11 terror strikes now this is a</text>
  <text start="506.61" dur="5.849">big topic that we could go into for</text>
  <text start="509.219" dur="5.971">hours however this tells the story of an</text>
  <text start="512.459" dur="5.341">insider that got into and found all</text>
  <text start="515.19" dur="4.94">sorts of information about the money</text>
  <text start="517.8" dur="5.13">trafficking operations behind al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="520.13" dur="7.329">directly dealing with Osama bin Laden</text>
  <text start="522.93" dur="6.12">and his propaganda and and money</text>
  <text start="527.459" dur="4.111">laundering operations which also</text>
  <text start="529.05" dur="5.789">included apparently a high-level player</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="5.22">in I believe it was Goldman Sachs so</text>
  <text start="534.839" dur="3.421">that tells you right there and and by</text>
  <text start="536.79" dur="4.35">the way the high level player at Goldman</text>
  <text start="538.26" dur="4.949">Sachs was never it was never</text>
  <text start="541.14" dur="3.449">investigated was never fired for</text>
  <text start="543.209" dur="3.391">actually they may have been fired for it</text>
  <text start="544.589" dur="4.111">later but then they was they never had</text>
  <text start="546.6" dur="3.81">an FBI investigation into them nothing</text>
  <text start="548.7" dur="3.509">ever came of it and they they probably</text>
  <text start="550.41" dur="3.299">are still doing it and they went to a</text>
  <text start="552.209" dur="2.82">different large firms so now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="553.709" dur="4.62">probably just doing it at a different</text>
  <text start="555.029" dur="6.691">Bank anyway so I mean make sure I was</text>
  <text start="558.329" dur="10.141">saying that right : sex or one of the</text>

  <text start="1525.21" dur="3.84">Joe Biden just did what you really want</text>
  <text start="1527.19" dur="3.63">to do is is be really nice and flowery</text>

  <text start="1535.02" dur="3.69">you&amp;#39;re showing open anger that means</text>
  <text start="1536.82" dur="3.3">that you&amp;#39;re weak so the Chinese have</text>
  <text start="1538.71" dur="3.72">been doing a lot of that lately and</text>
  <text start="1540.12" dur="5.19">president Trump&amp;#39;s pressure has got their</text>
  <text start="1542.43" dur="4.74">whole system ready to buckle they have</text>
  <text start="1545.31" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;ve had multiple bank runs they have</text>

  <text start="1556.98" dur="5.22">tests so what you&amp;#39;re looking at el and</text>
  <text start="1559.92" dur="4.95">of course their their industrial profits</text>
  <text start="1562.2" dur="4.08">are down more than ever before so what</text>
  <text start="1564.87" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re looking at is the worst ever</text>
  <text start="1566.28" dur="5.31">perfect storm of economy in China and</text>
  <text start="1568.77" dur="5.73">they have to still maintain power not go</text>
  <text start="1571.59" dur="4.89">down not have all of this anger from</text>
  <text start="1574.5" dur="4.29">their own people build up to to threaten</text>
  <text start="1576.48" dur="4.17">their power base and manage with</text>
  <text start="1578.79" dur="4.08">President Trump at the same time so</text>
  <text start="1580.65" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re in a very delicate situation all</text>
  <text start="1582.87" dur="5.13">those you Jinping has solidified his</text>
  <text start="1584.76" dur="6.33">power as emperor in China that power</text>
  <text start="1588" dur="5.46">still lies on people accepting it so if</text>
  <text start="1591.09" dur="4.77">things get bad enough in China maybe</text>
  <text start="1593.46" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;ll see a return to something other</text>
  <text start="1595.86" dur="3.84">than communism you know maybe it will be</text>
  <text start="1598.17" dur="3.66">an imperial dynasty or maybe it will be</text>
  <text start="1599.7" dur="4.98">a republic maybe something like Taiwan</text>
  <text start="1601.83" dur="4.8">did where they escaped from China during</text>
  <text start="1604.68" dur="3.63">those 20 plus million people being</text>
  <text start="1606.63" dur="3.45">murdered probably way plus being</text>
  <text start="1608.31" dur="4.17">murdered by the communist regime and</text>
  <text start="1610.08" dur="4.8">Chairman Mao so you know this is a</text>
  <text start="1612.48" dur="5.34">there&amp;#39;s a lot of context that goes into</text>
  <text start="1614.88" dur="5.88">this situation now all of that I also</text>
  <text start="1617.82" dur="6.18">want to talk about Ted Cruz&amp;#39;s bear</text>
  <text start="1620.76" dur="5.49">provocation and in Taiwan act threatens</text>
  <text start="1624" dur="5.22">disastrous war so again China</text>
  <text start="1626.25" dur="5.58">threatening war with us over Taiwan and</text>
  <text start="1629.22" dur="4.62">what Ted Cruz is doing in his support</text>
  <text start="1631.83" dur="5.1">for the quote Taiwan symbols of</text>
  <text start="1633.84" dur="5.25">sovereignty act so this act will display</text>
  <text start="1636.93" dur="4.47">legalize the display of the Taiwanese</text>
  <text start="1639.09" dur="5.82">flag at u.s. government agencies and</text>
  <text start="1641.4" dur="7.24">such so basically we are sending a lot</text>
  <text start="1644.91" dur="5.83">of public sentiment toward Taiwan</text>
  <text start="1648.64" dur="5.88">and protecting them in a sense from</text>
  <text start="1650.74" dur="5.49">China invading them so you know with</text>
  <text start="1654.52" dur="2.82">with Taiwan there it&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="1656.23" dur="2.91">different because they actually have a</text>
  <text start="1657.34" dur="4.98">defense treaty with the US if China</text>
  <text start="1659.14" dur="6.15">invades Taiwan we are obliged to go to</text>
  <text start="1662.32" dur="4.77">war with China now most governments are</text>
  <text start="1665.29" dur="3.48">most presidents in the past like Obama</text>
  <text start="1667.09" dur="3.84">probably would not have even honored it</text>
  <text start="1668.77" dur="5.94">and of course Taiwan situation was</text>
  <text start="1670.93" dur="5.73">looking increasingly bleak but now</text>
  <text start="1674.71" dur="3.72">thanks to people like Ted Cruz it looks</text>
  <text start="1676.66" dur="3.57">like in of course President Trump and</text>
  <text start="1678.43" dur="4.38">others bringing attention to this and</text>
  <text start="1680.23" dur="4.08">the internet China is being threatened</text>
  <text start="1682.81" dur="3.51">in ways that has never threatened them</text>
  <text start="1684.31" dur="3.15">before this is incredibly interesting to</text>
  <text start="1686.32" dur="4.59">see and the fact that they would</text>
  <text start="1687.46" dur="6.93">threaten war for this that alone tells</text>
  <text start="1690.91" dur="5.43">you right there just how weak they are</text>
  <text start="1694.39" dur="3.48">in this situation and just how desperate</text>
  <text start="1696.34" dur="3.87">they are because they have the one-china</text>
  <text start="1697.87" dur="4.68">policy and if you break the one-china</text>
  <text start="1700.21" dur="3.48">policy like if you talk to Taiwan as the</text>
