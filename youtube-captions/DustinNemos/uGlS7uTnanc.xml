  <text start="126.409" dur="4.711">comes at a Forbes calm US authorities</text>
  <text start="128.539" dur="5.431">seized 20 tons of cocaine from ship</text>
  <text start="131.12" dur="4.74">owned by JP Morgan now if you remember I</text>
  <text start="133.97" dur="7.26">actually covered the story back in the</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="7.68">middle of June and the this was one of</text>
  <text start="141.23" dur="5.79">the largest drug bust in US history</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="5.43">where they had found 20 tons of cocaine</text>
  <text start="147.02" dur="4.68">on the ship in</text>
  <text start="148.97" dur="6.81">the port of Philadelphia now the ship</text>
  <text start="151.7" dur="7.77">MSE McCain is now identified as a ship</text>
  <text start="155.78" dur="5.85">is owned by JP Morgan now this isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="159.47" dur="5.16">first time that this particular port has</text>
  <text start="161.63" dur="5.37">come under scrutiny for drug trafficking</text>
  <text start="164.63" dur="5.43">so back in March it was also busted for</text>
  <text start="167" dur="6.66">cocaine large amounts of cocaine and as</text>
  <text start="170.06" dur="6.69">well as fentanyl back in January now</text>
  <text start="173.66" dur="5.58">these aren&amp;#39;t the only busts but these</text>
  <text start="176.75" dur="7.32">are among the largest that have happened</text>
  <text start="179.24" dur="7.02">now it appears that JP Morgan is funding</text>
  <text start="184.07" dur="4.74">this drug trafficking operation of</text>
  <text start="186.26" dur="6.26">course this is drug trafficking on a</text>
  <text start="188.81" dur="6.54">global scale so we have a lot of these</text>
  <text start="192.52" dur="5.74">shipments are coming through places like</text>
  <text start="195.35" dur="6.3">Panama and Colombia and the fentanyl</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="6.47">shipment had originated in China so</text>
  <text start="201.65" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re all coming through this port and</text>
  <text start="204.73" dur="6.43">there are a few others but it seems to</text>
  <text start="207.92" dur="7.11">be a pattern that the port of</text>
  <text start="211.16" dur="7.14">Philadelphia is a major hub for this</text>
  <text start="215.03" dur="5.459">drug trafficking operation so it seems</text>
  <text start="218.3" dur="4.98">very likely that they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="220.489" dur="5.461">close in on the link that JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="223.28" dur="4.65">actually has with this drug trafficking</text>
  <text start="225.95" dur="4.59">operation especially based on the fact</text>
  <text start="227.93" dur="5.82">that a lot of these headlines now are</text>
  <text start="230.54" dur="5.09">mentioning JP Morgan even though in the</text>
  <text start="233.75" dur="5.58">past JP Morgan has really tried to</text>
  <text start="235.63" dur="5.59">distance itself from the actual drug</text>
  <text start="239.33" dur="5.7">trafficking and you know they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="8.43">even been mentioned really but now that</text>
  <text start="245.03" dur="7.38">they are being tied to this operation</text>
  <text start="249.65" dur="6.3">being named I think it&amp;#39;s very likely</text>
  <text start="252.41" dur="5.579">that they are going to be held</text>
  <text start="255.95" dur="4.68">accountable for their role it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="6.151">be finally revealed that these big Baker</text>
  <text start="260.63" dur="5.97">corporations are the ones behind a lot</text>
  <text start="264.14" dur="4.17">of these criminal operations so I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="266.6" dur="6.36">following this very closely and I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="268.31" dur="7.62">giving updates as it comes up in other</text>
  <text start="272.96" dur="4.179">news Elizabeth Warren says that she will</text>
  <text start="275.93" dur="6.069">increase admission of</text>
  <text start="277.139" dur="7.08">immigrants by 800% issue wins in 2020</text>
  <text start="281.999" dur="7.41">this is coming out of Sarah Carter calm</text>
  <text start="284.219" dur="8.16">so she obviously opposes president</text>
  <text start="289.409" dur="5.31">Trump&amp;#39;s policies on immigration and she</text>
  <text start="292.379" dur="6.021">is really a proponent for open borders</text>
  <text start="294.719" dur="7.651">so what she is proposing is called the</text>
  <text start="298.4" dur="7.21">fair and welcoming immigration act which</text>
  <text start="302.37" dur="5.25">you know essentially will increase the</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="7.44">admissions by eight hundred percent</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="8.849">admitting about 175,000 immigrants per</text>
  <text start="313.05" dur="7.29">year the problem with this is though of</text>
  <text start="316.469" dur="9.121">course is that while they&amp;#39;re wanting to</text>
  <text start="320.34" dur="8.609">pull more people in from other places we</text>
  <text start="325.59" dur="5.639">still don&amp;#39;t have apparently the</text>
  <text start="328.949" dur="8.43">resources to help those who are already</text>
  <text start="331.229" dur="9.18">here if they admit a hundred and seventy</text>
  <text start="337.379" dur="5.94">five thousand people per year from other</text>
  <text start="340.409" dur="5.25">places then the problems that we see in</text>
  <text start="343.319" dur="5.91">places like San Francisco and Los</text>
  <text start="345.659" dur="6.54">Angeles and like Skid Row those problems</text>
  <text start="349.229" dur="6.891">are only going to be exasperated because</text>
  <text start="352.199" dur="6.9">we don&amp;#39;t have the capacity to</text>
  <text start="356.12" dur="5.769">accommodate for this number of people</text>
  <text start="359.099" dur="7.761">especially since we apparently don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="361.889" dur="8.43">have the resources to help our own and</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="5.89">that&amp;#39;s why you see this epidemic growing</text>
  <text start="370.319" dur="4.56">of you know homeless people who are on</text>
  <text start="372.75" dur="4.349">the streets and people who are in</text>
  <text start="374.879" dur="7.741">poverty because you&amp;#39;re stretching the</text>
  <text start="377.099" dur="8.16">resources too thin in these areas but</text>
  <text start="382.62" dur="5.009">yet you know they want these people to</text>
  <text start="385.259" dur="6.9">come here because they want to gain</text>
  <text start="387.629" dur="6.56">their votes and of course among the</text>
  <text start="392.159" dur="7.021">other reasons why they wants it you know</text>
  <text start="394.189" dur="11.08">have open board borders but you know one</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="8.969">of the main reasons is for votes this is</text>
  <text start="405.269" dur="5.341">a huge problem but you know President</text>
  <text start="408.149" dur="5.281">Trump has been working very hard to</text>
  <text start="410.61" dur="4.739">try to limit the number of people who</text>
  <text start="413.43" dur="5.28">are coming into this country even though</text>
  <text start="415.349" dur="7.051">he&amp;#39;s faced a lot of resistance from the</text>
  <text start="418.71" dur="5.489">Democratic side in related news Trump</text>
  <text start="422.4" dur="3.63">gives ice the green lanten start date</text>
  <text start="424.199" dur="4.381">massive raids to begin in these four</text>
  <text start="426.03" dur="5.189">cities now President Trump does say that</text>
  <text start="428.58" dur="5.01">this isn&amp;#39;t necessarily a raid per se</text>
  <text start="431.219" dur="4.621">it&amp;#39;s more or less just a removal of</text>
  <text start="433.59" dur="4.289">illegal immigrants who don&amp;#39;t belong here</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="4.56">in the first place so this is going to</text>
  <text start="437.879" dur="5.79">begin in Miami at Los Angeles New York</text>
  <text start="440.4" dur="5.699">and Chicago on Sunday and of course</text>
  <text start="443.669" dur="4.731">there are other cities too but these are</text>
  <text start="446.099" dur="6.151">the major ones and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that</text>
  <text start="448.4" dur="5.919">they&amp;#39;re also going to take place in even</text>
  <text start="452.25" dur="4.439">smaller cities across the nation I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="454.319" dur="4.56">sure there are many more places this is</text>
  <text start="456.689" dur="3.78">going to take place but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="458.879" dur="3.78">necessarily want to give away that</text>
  <text start="460.469" dur="5.431">information and they shouldn&amp;#39;t because</text>
  <text start="462.659" dur="5.611">if they say oh we&amp;#39;re going here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="465.9" dur="3.96">going to you know remove illegals and</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="4.5">these are all of the places that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="469.86" dur="6">going to be that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="472.77" dur="6.019">because then the illegals who are there</text>
  <text start="475.86" dur="6.149">they are going to make themselves</text>
  <text start="478.789" dur="5.321">disappear for a while to hide because</text>
  <text start="482.009" dur="6.421">they don&amp;#39;t want to be removed right</text>
  <text start="484.11" dur="6.239">they&amp;#39;re not dumb so I think that even</text>
  <text start="488.43" dur="5.669">though he has named these four cities</text>
  <text start="490.349" dur="6.391">this is not it&amp;#39;s not limited to these</text>
  <text start="494.099" dur="4.981">four cities and I also don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="496.74" dur="4.349">it&amp;#39;s going to be limited to Sunday and</text>
  <text start="499.08" dur="5.369">of course this does come after a</text>
  <text start="501.089" dur="4.86">two-week delay when President Trump did</text>
  <text start="504.449" dur="3.9">hold off and he said that he was going</text>
  <text start="505.949" dur="4.53">to allow Democrats more time to</text>
  <text start="508.349" dur="6">negotiate better immigration reform</text>
  <text start="510.479" dur="6.44">however they did not budge whatsoever</text>
  <text start="514.349" dur="5.971">but of course this was not a surprise</text>
  <text start="516.919" dur="5.53">additionally even though he said that</text>
  <text start="520.32" dur="5.37">the delay was because he wanted to</text>
  <text start="522.449" dur="5.64">negotiate with the Democrats it is very</text>
  <text start="525.69" dur="5.73">possible that the that the delay was</text>
  <text start="528.089" dur="7.141">also because the information about the</text>
  <text start="531.42" dur="6.3">rain was leaked to the public and so you</text>
  <text start="535.23" dur="4.62">know of course it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="537.72" dur="3.929">to make an announcement that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="539.85" dur="5.219">going to go around</text>
  <text start="541.649" dur="5.761">and pickup illegals you know when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.069" dur="3.75">very likely that that is going to hinder</text>
  <text start="547.41" dur="3.839">the process because they&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="548.819" dur="4.89">to end up going into hiding so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="551.249" dur="4.56">likely that you know to preserve the</text>
  <text start="553.709" dur="4.11">integrity of the operation they then</text>
  <text start="555.809" dur="4.801">delayed it which is why I also think</text>
  <text start="557.819" dur="4.74">even now even though they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="560.61" dur="4.229">they&amp;#39;re gonna start this on Sunday and</text>
  <text start="562.559" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s you know they&amp;#39;re gonna be doing it</text>
  <text start="564.839" dur="6.3">in these four major cities I really</text>
  <text start="568.499" dur="5.34">doubt that it&amp;#39;s limited to Sunday and</text>
  <text start="571.139" dur="5.07">limited to those four cities and it also</text>
  <text start="573.839" dur="5.85">should be noted that this particular</text>
  <text start="576.209" dur="5.67">operation is really limited to illegals</text>
  <text start="579.689" dur="6">who have already went through the court</text>
  <text start="581.879" dur="6.721">process and it has been determined that</text>
  <text start="585.689" dur="5.161">they should go back to their country so</text>
  <text start="588.6" dur="4.529">these are people who you know the</text>
  <text start="590.85" dur="7.76">process has finished up and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="593.129" dur="8.58">belong here so they need to leave also</text>
  <text start="598.61" dur="6.12">finally present Trump issues an</text>
  <text start="601.709" dur="7.651">executive order in order to determine</text>
  <text start="604.73" dur="9.039">who is here as a citizen and who is not</text>
  <text start="609.36" dur="8.159">a citizen it&amp;#39;s trying to get around this</text>
  <text start="613.769" dur="5.851">whole citizenship question on the census</text>
  <text start="617.519" dur="4.471">so of course again like I said before</text>
  <text start="619.62" dur="5.73">the reason why the question really was</text>
  <text start="621.99" dur="6.24">supposed to be on the census was to</text>
  <text start="625.35" dur="7.709">determine who is a citizen and therefore</text>
  <text start="628.23" dur="7.859">eligible for these services such as you</text>
  <text start="633.059" dur="5.101">know the the funds that are supposed to</text>
  <text start="636.089" dur="4.94">be distributed for different districts</text>
  <text start="638.16" dur="6.929">also you know how many representatives</text>
  <text start="641.029" dur="8.53">each district has so it&amp;#39;s a closely</text>
  <text start="645.089" dur="7.021">based on the number of American citizens</text>
  <text start="649.559" dur="5.49">who are there not everyone which of</text>
  <text start="652.11" dur="4.349">course which would mean that illegals</text>
  <text start="655.049" dur="5.611">would be lumped into that because</text>
  <text start="656.459" dur="6.711">illegals should not benefit from those</text>
  <text start="660.66" dur="4.889">services they are not supposed to be</text>
  <text start="663.17" dur="6.82">represented by our elected officials</text>
  <text start="665.549" dur="6.811">right so the reason for the question was</text>
  <text start="669.99" dur="4.32">to determine who is the citizen and who</text>
  <text start="672.36" dur="5.159">is not so because</text>
  <text start="674.31" dur="5.67">there is so much resistance in adding</text>
  <text start="677.519" dur="4.43">this question on the census which is</text>
  <text start="679.98" dur="7.469">really unbelievable since only one</text>
  <text start="681.949" dur="9.24">president ever has not included it he</text>
  <text start="687.449" dur="8.19">has now issued an executive order that</text>
  <text start="691.189" dur="8.551">requires every government agency to hand</text>
  <text start="695.639" dur="7.851">over documents that will reveal citizens</text>
  <text start="699.74" dur="6.13">citizenship status of every individual</text>
  <text start="703.49" dur="5.05">because of course you know all of these</text>
  <text start="705.87" dur="5">agencies they do have records of you</text>
  <text start="708.54" dur="6.229">know it&amp;#39;s reported that they could</text>
  <text start="710.87" dur="7.269">determine about 90% of the population</text>
  <text start="714.769" dur="5.471">just based on these records alone so you</text>
  <text start="718.139" dur="3.961">know all of the illegals who are</text>
  <text start="720.24" dur="4.8">receiving welfare benefits and things</text>
  <text start="722.1" dur="4.89">like that that is going to be used</text>
  <text start="725.04" dur="5.64">citizen Herman how many people are</text>
  <text start="726.99" dur="6.81">citizens and how many are not in other</text>
  <text start="730.68" dur="5.73">news Alan Dershowitz who completely</text>
  <text start="733.8" dur="5.909">denies allegations that he had forced a</text>

  <text start="790.199" dur="4.26">with a group of lawyers that would</text>

  <text start="794.459" dur="3.271">have notes I&amp;#39;m sure it would confirm I</text>
  <text start="796.019" dur="2.831">never said anything like that what we</text>
  <text start="797.73" dur="3.7">did say</text>
  <text start="798.85" dur="6.989">that there was no credible evidence that</text>
  <text start="801.43" dur="7.139">Epstein at that time had transported any</text>
  <text start="805.839" dur="5.25">underage the woman in interstate</text>
  <text start="808.569" dur="4.171">commerce and that was required by the</text>
  <text start="811.089" dur="4.201">way the junior Arbus was not underage</text>
  <text start="812.74" dur="4.529">her own lawyer and she have all admitted</text>
  <text start="815.29" dur="5.789">now that she didn&amp;#39;t start working for</text>
  <text start="817.269" dur="6.601">Epstein until she was 17 years old and</text>
  <text start="821.079" dur="4.891">that she doesn&amp;#39;t even claim that she had</text>
  <text start="823.87" dur="4.019">sex with them numerous people she claims</text>
  <text start="825.97" dur="5.039">she have sex with former American</text>
  <text start="827.889" dur="6.57">congressmen until she was well well over</text>
  <text start="831.009" dur="4.711">age so she&amp;#39;s like just about everything</text>
  <text start="834.459" dur="11.091">and of course it&amp;#39;s the job of the</text>
  <text start="835.72" dur="12.45">defense attorney do you still represent</text>
  <text start="845.55" dur="5.38">him and when did you stop representing</text>
  <text start="848.17" dur="5.37">him Epstein no I stopped representing</text>
  <text start="850.93" dur="4.829">him when the deal was made and I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="853.54" dur="3.659">seen him in years and you know if his</text>
  <text start="855.759" dur="3.39">lawyers call me and asked me a question</text>
  <text start="857.199" dur="4.531">about the deal of course as a lawyer I</text>
  <text start="859.149" dur="5.151">have to answer that question look I was</text>
  <text start="861.73" dur="4.799">introduced to him by the lady Rothchild</text>
  <text start="864.3" dur="4.389">the people he hung out with at the time</text>
  <text start="866.529" dur="5.31">were the president of Harvard the</text>
  <text start="868.689" dur="5.731">Provost of Harvard my relationship was</text>
  <text start="871.839" dur="5.43">academic was academic we went to</text>
  <text start="874.42" dur="4.89">conferences we had seminars in his</text>
  <text start="877.269" dur="4.591">office none of us had any inkling that</text>
  <text start="879.31" dur="4.74">he had this other life and as soon as we</text>
  <text start="881.86" dur="4.529">learned about it obviously all of us</text>
  <text start="884.05" dur="4.649">ended any kind of a social relationship</text>
  <text start="886.389" dur="6.241">I then became his lawyer I&amp;#39;m proud of</text>
  <text start="888.699" dur="7.101">the fact that I represented so the</text>
  <text start="892.63" dur="6.959">reason why this is important is because</text>
  <text start="895.8" dur="7.75">the Rothschilds are also connected to</text>
  <text start="899.589" dur="6.331">the Brahmins because they have joint</text>
  <text start="903.55" dur="6.42">ownership over several companies</text>
  <text start="905.92" dur="7.039">including a financier a financial firm</text>
  <text start="909.97" dur="7.71">called Bronfman and Rothschild now also</text>
  <text start="912.959" dur="7.091">it came out that Claire Brockman who of</text>
  <text start="917.68" dur="7.07">course was indicted on racketeering</text>
  <text start="920.05" dur="7.979">charges she was she and others actually</text>
  <text start="924.75" dur="5.899">everyone who was involved being accused</text>
  <text start="928.029" dur="7.84">of being involved in the net</text>
  <text start="930.649" dur="8.19">in case they were relying on a very deep</text>
  <text start="935.869" dur="7.02">pocketed Defense Fund that was very</text>
  <text start="938.839" dur="10.17">likely funded through the Bronfman and</text>
  <text start="942.889" dur="9.87">Rothschild company so this here his</text>
  <text start="949.009" dur="7.38">statement that he said he met Epstein</text>
  <text start="952.759" dur="6.06">through lady Rothschild showed and</text>
  <text start="956.389" dur="5.88">especially the the nature of both of</text>
  <text start="958.819" dur="6.93">these cases separately so nexium was a</text>
  <text start="962.269" dur="6.081">sex trafficking operation they were also</text>
  <text start="965.749" dur="5.76">indictments of child sex trafficking</text>
  <text start="968.35" dur="5.829">Jeffrey Epstein case is a sex</text>
  <text start="971.509" dur="7.44">trafficking operation involving minors</text>
  <text start="974.179" dur="7.681">so these cases are very similar and in</text>
  <text start="978.949" dur="9">fact very likely part of the same</text>
  <text start="981.86" dur="9.599">network because in reality this sex</text>
  <text start="987.949" dur="6.87">trafficking operation of children is</text>
  <text start="991.459" dur="11.04">actually operating on a massive and</text>
  <text start="994.819" dur="10.26">global scale so this connection should</text>
  <text start="1002.499" dur="8.301">be looked at very closely and I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="1005.079" dur="10.38">sure that it is at this point and</text>
  <text start="1010.8" dur="5.889">related to this at least in my opinion</text>
  <text start="1015.459" dur="1.98">you can tell me what you think in the</text>
  <text start="1016.689" dur="2.81">comments below</text>
  <text start="1017.439" dur="6.39">related to this in my opinion is the</text>
  <text start="1019.499" dur="9.31">arrest of our Kelly so he has been</text>
  <text start="1023.829" dur="6.661">arrested by the NYPD in Chicago so</text>
  <text start="1028.809" dur="6.39">interestingly he was arrested in Chicago</text>
  <text start="1030.49" dur="7.62">but by NYPD and he was brought to New</text>
  <text start="1035.199" dur="5.61">York so he has federal charges in</text>
  <text start="1038.11" dur="4.469">Chicago as well as Brooklyn but they</text>
  <text start="1040.809" dur="2.311">brought him to the Eastern District of</text>
  <text start="1042.579" dur="4.921">New York</text>
  <text start="1043.12" dur="7.14">and so his charges include that of child</text>
  <text start="1047.5" dur="6.57">pornography and enticement of a minor</text>
  <text start="1050.26" dur="6.22">and also it&amp;#39;s likely that he is going to</text>
  <text start="1054.07" dur="8.109">be charged with trafficking</text>
  <text start="1056.48" dur="9.449">now back in 2008 when he was in trouble</text>
  <text start="1062.179" dur="7.021">for the raping of a minor he was on</text>
  <text start="1065.929" dur="9.901">videotape with a 13 year old girl that</text>
  <text start="1069.2" dur="9.859">case was completely destroyed by the</text>
  <text start="1075.83" dur="7.17">fact that the girl who was in that video</text>
  <text start="1079.059" dur="7.33">she denied that she was the one in that</text>
  <text start="1083" dur="6.09">video and also failed to testify it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1086.389" dur="4.861">likely that that&amp;#39;s because you know of</text>
  <text start="1089.09" dur="5.069">witness tampering where they intimidated</text>
  <text start="1091.25" dur="5.49">this young girl and so he was completely</text>
  <text start="1094.159" dur="6.031">acquitted of those charges and even now</text>
  <text start="1096.74" dur="6.84">it seems that he thinks that he is going</text>
  <text start="1100.19" dur="7.109">to get off he completely denies he</text>
  <text start="1103.58" dur="6.839">continues to deny all charges he claims</text>
  <text start="1107.299" dur="9.171">to be innocent and he was reportedly in</text>
  <text start="1110.419" dur="6.051">good spirits when he was arrested so he</text>
  <text start="1116.649" dur="5.26">probably thinks that because of the</text>
  <text start="1119.36" dur="5.64">connections that he has or that he has</text>
  <text start="1121.909" dur="6.11">had that he is untouchable that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1125" dur="7.5">these people think so</text>
  <text start="1128.019" dur="6.991">people like Epstein people like the</text>
  <text start="1132.5" dur="8.19">Brockman&amp;#39;s all of these people who had</text>
  <text start="1135.01" dur="8.259">escaped accountability before so Epstein</text>
  <text start="1140.69" dur="8.43">had got off basically with a slap on the</text>
  <text start="1143.269" dur="10.441">wrist ten years ago he likely thinks</text>
  <text start="1149.12" dur="5.97">that he is still untouchable now and I</text>
  <text start="1153.71" dur="4.11">mentioned in my last video in</text>
  <text start="1155.09" dur="5.13">yesterday&amp;#39;s news brief that you know it</text>
  <text start="1157.82" dur="4.859">has come out now that he is like he was</text>
  <text start="1160.22" dur="5.13">likely an intelligence asset that does</text>
  <text start="1162.679" dur="8.041">not mean he was a good guy the</text>
  <text start="1165.35" dur="8.1">intelligence agencies were the ones for</text>
  <text start="1170.72" dur="7.49">years who have perpetuated these</text>
  <text start="1173.45" dur="7.76">criminal operations for example</text>
  <text start="1178.21" dur="3">iran-contra</text>
  <text start="1182.28" dur="5.22">there are so many difficult and project</text>
  <text start="1185.64" dur="5.55">monarch let&amp;#39;s not forget about project</text>
  <text start="1187.5" dur="9.74">monarch okay these are operations that</text>
  <text start="1191.19" dur="9.99">were headed by intelligence agencies and</text>
  <text start="1197.24" dur="9.4">the more focus that is placed on the</text>
  <text start="1201.18" dur="10.71">fact that Epstein was an intelligence</text>
  <text start="1206.64" dur="7.53">asset and it&amp;#39;s that all of these</text>
  <text start="1211.89" dur="4.71">networks are not separate they&amp;#39;re part</text>
  <text start="1214.17" dur="5.31">of the same thing then the real story</text>
  <text start="1216.6" dur="6.6">can come out and real accountability can</text>
  <text start="1219.48" dur="5.91">happen so I&amp;#39;ll be following all of these</text>
  <text start="1223.2" dur="3.96">stories very very closely and will be</text>
  <text start="1225.39" dur="6.14">giving you updates of course as they</text>
  <text start="1227.16" dur="8.6">come up alright so in good news a</text>
  <text start="1231.53" dur="6.73">federal appeals court has stated that</text>
  <text start="1235.76" dur="4.84">President Trump can defund Planned</text>
  <text start="1238.26" dur="4.98">Parenthood and that will cut almost 60</text>
  <text start="1240.6" dur="8.43">million dollars in taxpayer money per</text>
  <text start="1243.24" dur="10.62">year this is annually right so this is a</text>
  <text start="1249.03" dur="8.1">partial defund now opponents to this</text>
  <text start="1253.86" dur="4.89">have said oh you can&amp;#39;t defund Planned</text>
  <text start="1257.13" dur="3.45">Parenthood because they offer all of</text>
  <text start="1258.75" dur="4.11">these different services like cancer</text>
  <text start="1260.58" dur="4.47">screenings and like gynecological</text>
  <text start="1262.86" dur="3.81">checkups and all of these things women&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1265.05" dur="5.4">health services at birth control that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1266.67" dur="6.57">so important okay well what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1270.45" dur="7.92">doing here is they&amp;#39;re going to separate</text>
  <text start="1273.24" dur="7.95">the services because this sixty million</text>
  <text start="1278.37" dur="6.45">dollars in tax Crippen this is title 10</text>
  <text start="1281.19" dur="5.85">funds and title 10 funds say then it</text>
  <text start="1284.82" dur="4.68">cannot be used for abortions it can be</text>
  <text start="1287.04" dur="4.95">used for services like birth control</text>
  <text start="1289.5" dur="5.58">family planning and all of that but it</text>
  <text start="1291.99" dur="7.02">cannot be used for abortions however</text>
  <text start="1295.08" dur="10.8">because these services were offered in</text>
  <text start="1299.01" dur="9.96">the same building then ultimately it was</text>
  <text start="1305.88" dur="5.1">funding abortions because they&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="1308.97" dur="5.86">same building so whether or not it was</text>
  <text start="1310.98" dur="8.35">directly funding it it was still benefit</text>
  <text start="1314.83" dur="9.06">from that money it was still funding it</text>
  <text start="1319.33" dur="7.82">so now they&amp;#39;re talking about forcing the</text>
  <text start="1323.89" dur="4.38">separation of the services where</text>
  <text start="1327.15" dur="4.47">abortion</text>
  <text start="1328.27" dur="6.62">we&amp;#39;re basically clinics that offer</text>
  <text start="1331.62" dur="6.97">abortions cannot receive these funds</text>
  <text start="1334.89" dur="6.43">however clinics that do not offer</text>
  <text start="1338.59" dur="5.73">abortions but offer those other services</text>
  <text start="1341.32" dur="7.79">they can receive the funds so that will</text>
  <text start="1344.32" dur="7.98">separate the operations right so then</text>
  <text start="1349.11" dur="5.74">Planned Parenthood if they want to still</text>
  <text start="1352.3" dur="4.56">receive or any clinic that wants to</text>
  <text start="1354.85" dur="5.22">receive these funds they have to make</text>
  <text start="1356.86" dur="7.52">sure that you know abortions are not</text>
  <text start="1360.07" dur="9.12">offered in that building whatsoever so</text>
  <text start="1364.38" dur="8.14">you know then that means those clinics</text>
  <text start="1369.19" dur="5.4">that offer abortions will have to pay</text>
  <text start="1372.52" dur="3.66">for their overhead in some other way</text>
  <text start="1374.59" dur="6.03">because they&amp;#39;re not going to be funded</text>
  <text start="1376.18" dur="5.97">by tax payers so this is good news and</text>
  <text start="1380.62" dur="4.68">of course you know they&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="1382.15" dur="5.9">going to appeal this again but I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="1385.3" dur="5.34">it will still stand because you know</text>
  <text start="1388.05" dur="4.54">because they&amp;#39;re separating it now they</text>
  <text start="1390.64" dur="4.08">can&amp;#39;t make the claim that you know</text>
  <text start="1392.59" dur="4.86">you&amp;#39;re defunding these very important</text>
  <text start="1394.72" dur="6.84">women&amp;#39;s health services they can&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="1397.45" dur="6.21">that argument anymore okay so that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1401.56" dur="5.07">I have for today thank you so much guys</text>
