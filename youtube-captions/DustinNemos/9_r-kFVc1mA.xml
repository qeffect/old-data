  <text start="11.45" dur="5.02">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="14.16" dur="4.35">most of the Nemo&amp;#39;s news network and I am</text>
  <text start="16.47" dur="4.08">joined today by Micah Volpe who&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="18.51" dur="4.62">investigative journalist who among other</text>
  <text start="20.55" dur="5.37">topics has been diving into the abuses</text>
  <text start="23.13" dur="4.95">of the Child Protective Services sector</text>
  <text start="25.92" dur="4.38">of our government and it has turned into</text>
  <text start="28.08" dur="4.56">a bit of a mafia in my personal opinion</text>
  <text start="30.3" dur="5.579">that engages in things like medical</text>
  <text start="32.64" dur="4.349">kidnapping kids for cash but in a</text>
  <text start="35.879" dur="3.18">different way you&amp;#39;ve heard that term</text>
  <text start="36.989" dur="3.721">applied to prisons and such anyway so</text>
  <text start="39.059" dur="2.82">I&amp;#39;m going to let Mike here who&amp;#39;s more of</text>
  <text start="40.71" dur="3.27">an expert on this than I am</text>
  <text start="41.879" dur="4.02">dive into these topics with us today so</text>
  <text start="43.98" dur="4.019">Mike thank you for joining us and I</text>
  <text start="45.899" dur="5.701">appreciate your time and I appreciate</text>
  <text start="47.999" dur="5.97">you covering a hard topic to cover right</text>
  <text start="51.6" dur="4.86">and I agree with you that it&amp;#39;s my feel</text>
  <text start="53.969" dur="6.39">like the the the legal term for it is</text>
  <text start="56.46" dur="6.84">rackets hearing what happens is these</text>
  <text start="60.359" dur="5.251">cases aren&amp;#39;t done fairly some of the</text>
  <text start="63.3" dur="4.98">participants know ahead of time what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="65.61" dur="4.23">about to happen essentially and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="68.28" dur="5.339">going through the motions and it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="69.84" dur="8.04">of Records hearing and it&amp;#39;s really it</text>
  <text start="73.619" dur="7.651">should be prosecuted that way but you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="77.88" dur="5.64">absolutely right that CPS has turned</text>
  <text start="81.27" dur="4.349">into an organized criminal enterprise</text>
  <text start="83.52" dur="5.97">that said I think you mean by mafia like</text>
  <text start="85.619" dur="6.481">that it the the snatching of kids is</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="4.409">done in an illegal way and organized</text>
  <text start="92.1" dur="4.14">criminal enterprise meaning it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="93.899" dur="4.29">like a one-off that somebody hears</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="4.83">somebody there that this is the way</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="5.731">business is done and and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="101.07" dur="5.64">absolutely right and in my opinion the</text>
  <text start="103.92" dur="5.22">main reason for that is that there have</text>
  <text start="106.71" dur="4.409">been there are federal programs based on</text>
  <text start="109.14" dur="5.339">laws passed by Congress signed by</text>
  <text start="111.119" dur="6.511">presidents which incentivize taking kids</text>
  <text start="114.479" dur="5.341">and the more kids who are taken and</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="5.79">first placed in the foster care and if</text>
  <text start="119.82" dur="7.679">possible also adopted out the more money</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="7.32">that the state makes so these social</text>
  <text start="127.499" dur="5.161">workers and CPS are given all sorts of</text>
  <text start="130.74" dur="5.4">latitude by the people above them and by</text>
  <text start="132.66" dur="8.04">law enforcement because they are padding</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="6.72">the coffers so the original law was</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="6.3">which is the child abuse prevention and</text>
  <text start="142.86" dur="8.73">treatment 1974 and that introduced these</text>
  <text start="147" dur="7.02">incentives anytime a child is taken from</text>
  <text start="151.59" dur="6.26">their parents and placed in the foster</text>
  <text start="154.02" dur="6.62">care system the state gets money</text>
  <text start="157.85" dur="5.6">and so the original thought was oh</text>
  <text start="160.64" dur="5.61">there&amp;#39;s so many kids who are vulnerable</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="5.77">and we want to make sure that the states</text>
  <text start="166.25" dur="6.93">have resources so we&amp;#39;ll create these</text>
  <text start="169.22" dur="7.14">grants so turned out there weren&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="173.18" dur="6.48">many vulnerable kids but the grant</text>
  <text start="176.36" dur="7.68">seemed like like a pot of gold to each</text>
  <text start="179.66" dur="7.02">of the states and and essentially like a</text>
  <text start="184.04" dur="4.23">like a kid in a candy store how much you</text>
  <text start="186.68" dur="4.62">know is a bowling for dollars how many</text>
  <text start="188.27" dur="6.63">of these can we get so they started</text>
  <text start="191.3" dur="8.31">taking more and more kids and if you are</text>
  <text start="194.9" dur="7.86">taking them from good fit homes the only</text>
  <text start="199.61" dur="5.55">way to do it is to manipulate the court</text>
  <text start="202.76" dur="5.52">system in an illegal unfair and</text>
  <text start="205.16" dur="5.46">racketeering sort of away the the next</text>
  <text start="208.28" dur="6.78">law was the adoption and Safe Families</text>
  <text start="210.62" dur="8.19">Act in 1997 I don&amp;#39;t want to say it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="215.06" dur="6.3">brainchild of Hillary Clinton it&amp;#39;s it it</text>
  <text start="218.81" dur="5.07">was a part of her idea that it takes a</text>
  <text start="221.36" dur="5.46">village to raise a child and so this</text>
  <text start="223.88" dur="5.46">introduced all sections of Social</text>
  <text start="226.82" dur="4.95">Security tweedle for which the entirety</text>
  <text start="229.34" dur="5.82">is a complete disaster and should just</text>
  <text start="231.77" dur="7.59">be eliminated so B and E were two</text>
  <text start="235.16" dur="7.29">sections which gave money for if CPS</text>
  <text start="239.36" dur="6.33">takes a child B is if they ultimately</text>
  <text start="242.45" dur="6.39">are reunited with the family e is</text>
  <text start="245.69" dur="6.75">through foster care and the problem was</text>
  <text start="248.84" dur="5.49">e has a much bigger pot that B so the</text>
  <text start="252.44" dur="4.74">incentive was that take the kid and then</text>
  <text start="254.33" dur="5.82">a spa on top of it gave an extra</text>
  <text start="257.18" dur="5.34">incentive if the kid is in foster care</text>
  <text start="260.15" dur="7.14">and that runs out and then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.52" dur="7.35">adopted out so the what happens is the</text>
  <text start="267.29" dur="5.34">whole purpose of CPS is to get your kid</text>
  <text start="269.87" dur="4.56">place them into foster care get as much</text>
  <text start="272.63" dur="3.84">money from there as possible and then</text>
  <text start="274.43" dur="5.16">once that money runs out let&amp;#39;s see if we</text>
  <text start="276.47" dur="6.45">can get them adopted up and and then the</text>
  <text start="279.59" dur="6.69">medical stuff I can&amp;#39;t prove it but I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="282.92" dur="8.18">seen some evidence that there&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="286.28" dur="7.67">more on that and that if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.1" dur="6.15">medical testing there&amp;#39;s money involved</text>
  <text start="293.95" dur="5.97">and so I think one of the reasons you</text>
  <text start="297.25" dur="4.17">see these medical kidnappings is wonder</text>
  <text start="299.92" dur="4.41">if some of these kids are guinea pigs</text>
  <text start="301.42" dur="5.97">and that I believe is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="304.33" dur="4.56">with a with Justina Pelletier and for</text>
  <text start="307.39" dur="3.18">those people who aren&amp;#39;t familiar that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.89" dur="3.9">probably one of the if not the most</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="5.82">notorious case certainly right there I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="312.79" dur="6.81">on the shortlist 2014 where she had a</text>
  <text start="316.39" dur="5.25">mitochondrial disorder in some Hospital</text>
  <text start="319.6" dur="3.78">that didn&amp;#39;t even treat her regularly</text>
  <text start="321.64" dur="4.71">they only went there because the regular</text>
  <text start="323.38" dur="5.37">house doctor wasn&amp;#39;t sick or just wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="326.35" dur="3.93">there that day the regular hospital was</text>
  <text start="328.75" dur="4.05">tossed they went to Boston Children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.28" dur="4.32">Hospital in this particular day decided</text>
  <text start="332.8" dur="4.08">that all of it was in her head that she</text>
  <text start="334.6" dur="5.25">doesn&amp;#39;t have this mitochondrial disorder</text>
  <text start="336.88" dur="6.24">I think it was decided she does at least</text>
  <text start="339.85" dur="4.92">possible and we want to get her into</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="4.71">this medical testing and that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="344.77" dur="5.43">probably the boilerplate example of</text>
  <text start="347.83" dur="4.89">medical kidnapping but all of this in</text>
  <text start="350.2" dur="6.63">general it&amp;#39;s hard to know why they do</text>
  <text start="352.72" dur="5.76">any individual case but I&amp;#39;m the hold of</text>
  <text start="356.83" dur="3.45">thousands tens of thousands hundreds of</text>
  <text start="358.48" dur="4.56">thousands of millions of cases that are</text>
  <text start="360.28" dur="5.37">out there generally because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="363.04" dur="4.32">getting money to do this thing whether</text>
  <text start="365.65" dur="3.05">that happened in Justina&amp;#39;s case who</text>
  <text start="367.36" dur="5.88">knows I don&amp;#39;t to have this specific</text>
  <text start="368.7" dur="8.41">checks or wire transfers to attach her</text>
  <text start="373.24" dur="5.52">to her case still in general you see CPS</text>
  <text start="377.11" dur="4.2">talking about all these funding streams</text>
  <text start="378.76" dur="5.13">a lot if you you know you see their raw</text>
  <text start="381.31" dur="5.04">video and their training sessions so in</text>
  <text start="383.89" dur="4.41">general they talking about it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="386.35" dur="5.46">certainly aware of it they know how it</text>
  <text start="388.3" dur="8.34">works and kids kids snatched you know I</text>
  <text start="391.81" dur="8.01">it yeah it becomes a it&amp;#39;s a challenge</text>
  <text start="396.64" dur="7.29">who does equal for you know what why and</text>
  <text start="399.82" dur="5.43">I quoted it wrong originally before all</text>
  <text start="403.93" dur="3.03">of this got started there&amp;#39;s about a</text>
  <text start="405.25" dur="4.47">hundred fifty one hundred and sixty</text>
  <text start="406.96" dur="5.76">thousand kids in foster care in the 60s</text>
  <text start="409.72" dur="5.55">it topped out at like five hundred and</text>
  <text start="412.72" dur="4.71">fifty thousand in like the early 2000s</text>
  <text start="415.27" dur="3.899">so what I think happened was ask for</text>
  <text start="417.43" dur="3.72">head like that initial explosion it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="419.169" dur="3.81">settled at about four hundred fifty</text>
  <text start="421.15" dur="3.63">thousand even where the population</text>
  <text start="422.979" dur="3.871">growth that&amp;#39;s a pretty</text>
  <text start="424.78" dur="3.87">growth in the number of kids in foster</text>
  <text start="426.85" dur="3.539">care and when you think about it there</text>
  <text start="428.65" dur="3.69">shouldn&amp;#39;t be any reason for more than a</text>
  <text start="430.389" dur="4.981">handful of kids to the in foster care</text>
  <text start="432.34" dur="6.09">there&amp;#39;s grandparents aunts uncles</text>
  <text start="435.37" dur="5.97">neighbors everyone why why do they need</text>
  <text start="438.43" dur="6.57">to be in a foster system there</text>
  <text start="441.34" dur="5.61">how many kids really have no one how</text>
  <text start="445" dur="3.48">many kids have terrible parents that</text>
  <text start="446.95" dur="5.04">have no business being anywhere near the</text>
  <text start="448.48" dur="5.28">kid and no one around them none zero and</text>
  <text start="451.99" dur="3.99">why do they all have to go through the</text>
  <text start="453.76" dur="7.98">foster system and I think that is</text>
  <text start="455.98" dur="7.29">absolutely tied to to the to the funding</text>
  <text start="461.74" dur="5.04">and more than one person has told me</text>
  <text start="463.27" dur="6.57">that CPS will ignore the grandparent the</text>
  <text start="466.78" dur="5.88">aunts the uncles and the neighbors in in</text>
  <text start="469.84" dur="5.01">in any given case but in several that</text>
  <text start="472.66" dur="3.569">I&amp;#39;ve heard and they believe it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="474.85" dur="2.43">you get more money if you get them into</text>
  <text start="476.229" dur="4.681">the foster system</text>
  <text start="477.28" dur="6.33">sure and so the funding creates this</text>
  <text start="480.91" dur="4.44">perverse six in this perverse incentive</text>
  <text start="483.61" dur="4.86">and the way to fix is to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="485.35" dur="5.01">funding look in my opinion CPS is itself</text>
  <text start="488.47" dur="4.32">unconstitutional illegal you should just</text>
  <text start="490.36" dur="2.67">get rid of CPS it does more harm than</text>
  <text start="492.79" dur="2.58">good</text>
  <text start="493.03" dur="5.699">anyway even without this funding stream</text>
  <text start="495.37" dur="6.75">I don&amp;#39;t if there is a crime committed we</text>
  <text start="498.729" dur="7.411">have law enforcement and what CPS does I</text>
  <text start="502.12" dur="6.18">think is is nonsense if there&amp;#39;s no crime</text>
  <text start="506.14" dur="3.57">committed don&amp;#39;t even get involved they</text>
  <text start="508.3" dur="3.179">operate with a different set of rules</text>
  <text start="509.71" dur="4.05">than the usual courts they have all</text>
  <text start="511.479" dur="5.211">sorts of advantages that that typically</text>
  <text start="513.76" dur="5.31">the state would not have and</text>
  <text start="516.69" dur="4.149">constitutional rights are limited and of</text>
  <text start="519.07" dur="3.659">course they sometimes they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="520.839" dur="4.381">need a warrant and they&amp;#39;re very pushing</text>
  <text start="522.729" dur="5.191">and we&amp;#39;ve talked about incentive side of</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="4.68">things is this why you think that often</text>
  <text start="527.92" dur="3.51">times you hear about maybe the judges or</text>
  <text start="529.9" dur="3.51">even the local police station being</text>
  <text start="531.43" dur="3.99">involved with it may not always of</text>
  <text start="533.41" dur="3.9">course but oftentimes that&amp;#39;s why I have</text>
  <text start="535.42" dur="4.71">mentioned the word mafia because they</text>
  <text start="537.31" dur="5.61">seem to to work sort of right right yeah</text>
  <text start="540.13" dur="5.94">because the dirty little secret is I</text>
  <text start="542.92" dur="8.25">think that but budgets are balanced in</text>
  <text start="546.07" dur="7.769">part by by getting these funds so if you</text>
  <text start="551.17" dur="5.39">do the right thing you have to tighten</text>
  <text start="553.839" dur="4.31">your belt a lot as a governor</text>
  <text start="556.56" dur="3.449">and there&amp;#39;s all sorts of goodies</text>
  <text start="558.149" dur="4.591">programs that you&amp;#39;re giving out but you</text>
  <text start="560.009" dur="5.25">now have to say no to ice that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="562.74" dur="6.3">dirty little secret yeah I think I think</text>
  <text start="565.259" dur="9.08">it&amp;#39;s structured in a way to maximize the</text>
  <text start="569.04" dur="8.459">amount of kids taken and yeah look</text>
  <text start="574.339" dur="5.771">police often show up with CPS to make</text>
  <text start="577.499" dur="4.911">sure that their orders are executed not</text>
  <text start="580.11" dur="6.329">to make sure that they follow the law</text>
  <text start="582.41" dur="8.38">and so you wonder no I agree with you</text>
  <text start="586.439" dur="6.63">look it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s hard to have the proof of</text>
  <text start="590.79" dur="4.14">the direct connection because it would</text>
  <text start="593.069" dur="4.95">remember one it would require resources</text>
  <text start="594.93" dur="5.009">I don&amp;#39;t have subpoenas and your bank</text>
  <text start="598.019" dur="4.68">records and you know a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="599.939" dur="5.281">other things that I as a journalist</text>
  <text start="602.699" dur="4.591">couldn&amp;#39;t but I&amp;#39;ve actually told FBI</text>
  <text start="605.22" dur="4.739">agents to look into this whether or not</text>
  <text start="607.29" dur="4.919">they will I can&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;ve told people with</text>
  <text start="609.959" dur="3.721">the resources where I think you should</text>
  <text start="612.209" dur="5.25">look whether or not they look I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="613.68" dur="5.699">know but as far as the the pattern what</text>
  <text start="617.459" dur="4.591">this is called a circumstantial evidence</text>
  <text start="619.379" dur="4.471">I think you and I can provide compelling</text>
  <text start="622.05" dur="4.139">circumstantial evidence that this is</text>
  <text start="623.85" dur="3.599">happening on a mass scale and that the</text>
  <text start="626.189" dur="4.65">reason that&amp;#39;s happening is because these</text>
  <text start="627.449" dur="6.481">federal funds incentivize it you know I</text>
  <text start="630.839" dur="6.271">often report on a different sort of</text>
  <text start="633.93" dur="4.56">human trafficking but it overlaps a lot</text>
  <text start="637.11" dur="3.539">of times it seems like a lot of these</text>
  <text start="638.49" dur="4.26">sexual predators take children from the</text>
  <text start="640.649" dur="3.63">system or even abuse them within the</text>
  <text start="642.75" dur="3.66">Child Protective Services system it</text>
  <text start="644.279" dur="3.87">seems like and I could be wrong here the</text>
  <text start="646.41" dur="3.899">the sexual molestation rate is over a</text>
  <text start="648.149" dur="4.62">third of these children and then that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="650.309" dur="4.38">nine clean I don&amp;#39;t know that number</text>
  <text start="652.769" dur="3.99">however there&amp;#39;s a State Department</text>
  <text start="654.689" dur="4.531">report from earlier this year which</text>
  <text start="656.759" dur="5.82">found that the foster care system is the</text>
  <text start="659.22" dur="7.89">number one feed like a like almost like</text>
  <text start="662.579" dur="7.95">a minor league for sexual transfer or</text>
  <text start="667.11" dur="6.959">sexual trafficking specifically but if</text>
  <text start="670.529" dur="5.22">you are taking a child to get a federal</text>
  <text start="674.069" dur="3.45">incentive if that&amp;#39;s the reason you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.749" dur="3.27">doing it that is human trafficking</text>
  <text start="677.519" dur="4.56">because human trafficking is the</text>
  <text start="679.019" dur="5.01">movement of people for money so all of</text>
  <text start="682.079" dur="4.44">this is in a variety of ways human</text>
  <text start="684.029" dur="5.28">trafficking and then and I think we can</text>
  <text start="686.519" dur="3.491">move on to the next topic I see it in</text>
  <text start="689.309" dur="4.181">family</text>
  <text start="690.01" dur="6.27">in general whether CPS is involved or</text>
  <text start="693.49" dur="5.55">not so one of the things that I see in</text>
  <text start="696.28" dur="6.14">Family Court and this is backed up by a</text>
  <text start="699.04" dur="7.29">survey and and other anecdotal evidence</text>
  <text start="702.42" dur="6.76">abusive mostly men often get custody of</text>
  <text start="706.33" dur="4.98">their kids and so the survey that I</text>
  <text start="709.18" dur="4.77">thought that I found the survey the</text>
  <text start="711.31" dur="4.62">definitive survey on this was in 2007 by</text>
  <text start="713.95" dur="4.26">the Leadership Council for interpersonal</text>
  <text start="715.93" dur="5.25">violence which concluded that roughly</text>
  <text start="718.21" dur="7.8">58,000 children per year are placed with</text>
  <text start="721.18" dur="7.2">an abuser and the reason that happens is</text>
  <text start="726.01" dur="5.52">a different set of money there is</text>
  <text start="728.38" dur="6.17">something called fatherhood gov and exit</text>
  <text start="731.53" dur="6.12">and access I&amp;#39;m sorry and visitation</text>
  <text start="734.55" dur="5.65">grants and then combined with that is</text>
  <text start="737.65" dur="4.77">Social Security title 4d and what that</text>
  <text start="740.2" dur="4.56">is that&amp;#39;s for child support because what</text>
  <text start="742.42" dur="5.55">these abusive men do is first they get</text>
  <text start="744.76" dur="4.8">custody and then since their exes no</text>
  <text start="747.97" dur="3.3">longer have physical custody they can</text>
  <text start="749.56" dur="3.93">then go after them for child support and</text>
  <text start="751.27" dur="4.05">they make the child support an amount</text>
  <text start="753.49" dur="5.25">they can&amp;#39;t pay and it becomes another</text>
  <text start="755.32" dur="6.03">form of abuse and so these fatherhood</text>
  <text start="758.74" dur="6.11">grants also under Clinton and that was</text>
  <text start="761.35" dur="7.4">actually part of the welfare reform TANF</text>
  <text start="764.85" dur="7.51">and the thought process behind it was</text>
  <text start="768.75" dur="6.4">one reason why we have so many women on</text>
  <text start="772.36" dur="4.44">welfare is their single mothers and so</text>
  <text start="775.15" dur="3.63">since they have to take care of their</text>
  <text start="776.8" dur="4.77">kids it&amp;#39;s hard for them to find a job so</text>
  <text start="778.78" dur="5.31">maybe if we can introduce man into the</text>
  <text start="781.57" dur="6">lives of these children will reduce some</text>
  <text start="784.09" dur="5.4">of the welfare and what it turned out is</text>
  <text start="787.57" dur="4.11">most of the men who try to take</text>
  <text start="789.49" dur="4.53">advantage of the program are abusive so</text>
  <text start="791.68" dur="6.27">the two best examples are John Allen</text>
  <text start="794.02" dur="5.94">Muhammad the Beltway sniper he got money</text>
  <text start="797.95" dur="4.02">under this program tried to get custody</text>
  <text start="799.96" dur="3.48">of his kid they still said no and then</text>
  <text start="801.97" dur="4.44">he became the Beltway sniper with all</text>
  <text start="803.44" dur="4.83">within six months Josh Ozersky what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="806.41" dur="3.45">sure I&amp;#39;m mispronouncing his name he</text>
  <text start="808.27" dur="3.54">along with stephen hayes were the</text>
  <text start="809.86" dur="5.4">murderers of the penet family he was</text>
  <text start="811.81" dur="5.34">actually in jail and started the process</text>
  <text start="815.26" dur="4.38">to try to get custody of his daughter</text>
  <text start="817.15" dur="5.04">and he did get custody after he got out</text>
  <text start="819.64" dur="4.02">of jail but the process a human he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="822.19" dur="4.47">going to like</text>
  <text start="823.66" dur="5.37">hearings while he&amp;#39;s in jail and the</text>
  <text start="826.66" dur="5.1">court for whatever reason catered to</text>
  <text start="829.03" dur="5.34">this guy the obviously his ex had</text>
  <text start="831.76" dur="4.2">physical custody is in jail so the the</text>
  <text start="834.37" dur="3.27">coordination catered to him and then</text>
  <text start="835.96" dur="4.41">surely after he got custody of his</text>
  <text start="837.64" dur="5.55">daughter he killed the penet family that</text>
  <text start="840.37" dur="4.41">was a a very notorious I think 2011 a</text>
  <text start="843.19" dur="3.45">home invasion probably the most</text>
  <text start="844.78" dur="5.07">notorious home invasion ever I think by</text>
  <text start="846.64" dur="5.55">everyone by but mr. Pettit died I think</text>
  <text start="849.85" dur="5.52">his four kids and his wife all were</text>
  <text start="852.19" dur="5.73">murdered and but it it&amp;#39;s a feeding</text>
  <text start="855.37" dur="4.71">ground to these abusive men and one of</text>
  <text start="857.92" dur="6.17">the things they do is it&amp;#39;s all these</text>
  <text start="860.08" dur="7.68">father&amp;#39;s rights people which it&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="864.09" dur="5.89">to stand up for fathers but that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="867.76" dur="4.89">not most of these groups aren&amp;#39;t simply</text>
  <text start="869.98" dur="7.11">standing up for fathers they propagate</text>
  <text start="872.65" dur="7.74">really bogus theories they they make it</text>
  <text start="877.09" dur="5.58">appear as though men are get the short</text>
  <text start="880.39" dur="4.47">end of the stick in Family Court which</text>
  <text start="882.67" dur="4.53">they may or may not do but their</text>
  <text start="884.86" dur="5.82">solutions are basically like this</text>
  <text start="887.2" dur="7.05">swinging it the other way and part of</text>
  <text start="890.68" dur="5.76">their theories is that allegations of</text>
  <text start="894.25" dur="6.21">abuse you should be extremely skeptical</text>
  <text start="896.44" dur="7.83">and it&amp;#39;s the parent coaching and lots</text>
  <text start="900.46" dur="6.48">and lots of mothers coach their kids to</text>
  <text start="904.27" dur="5.03">make allegations of abuse which is not</text>
  <text start="906.94" dur="5.13">backed up by any science or psychology</text>
  <text start="909.3" dur="5.8">the term is parental alienation which is</text>
  <text start="912.07" dur="5.88">an oppression all term I in parental</text>
  <text start="915.1" dur="4.59">alienation is not recognized by the DSM</text>

  <text start="940.9" dur="5.46">what will happen is a woman and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="944.05" dur="4.74">often not her the child comes forward</text>
  <text start="946.36" dur="7.08">with an allegation of abuse and sexual</text>

  <text start="962.08" dur="5.82">nominated but a point one two there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="965.64" dur="4.69">notorious case out of Connecticut sunny</text>
  <text start="967.9" dur="6.36">Kelley they appointed twelve court</text>
  <text start="970.33" dur="6.63">professionals to basically analyze the</text>
  <text start="974.26" dur="4.95">allegation and they all concluded it was</text>
  <text start="976.96" dur="5.31">a bogus allegation and she and her</text>
  <text start="979.21" dur="5.55">family spent over a million dollars so</text>
  <text start="982.27" dur="4.35">why does this happen because the minute</text>
  <text start="984.76" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s an allegation and then the</text>
  <text start="986.62" dur="5.34">responses they&amp;#39;re being coached you can</text>
  <text start="988.93" dur="5.13">bring in one to twelve core</text>
  <text start="991.96" dur="4.32">professionals let them charge two to</text>
  <text start="994.06" dur="4.65">four hundred dollars an hour in the case</text>
  <text start="996.28" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;ll talk about the rookie case there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="998.71" dur="4.26">one court professionals name is Paul</text>
  <text start="1001.02" dur="4.38">reitman was on the case for three weeks</text>
  <text start="1002.97" dur="3.09">and he told me that he made a hundred</text>
  <text start="1005.4" dur="3.12">grand</text>
  <text start="1006.06" dur="4.14">for three weeks worth of work and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1008.52" dur="3.75">just one case can you imagine how much</text>
  <text start="1010.2" dur="4.71">money the only thing is I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="1012.27" dur="4.53">him I think he was like trying to brag</text>
  <text start="1014.91" dur="3.99">and probably didn&amp;#39;t make a hundred grand</text>
  <text start="1016.8" dur="5.43">but same a twenty five grand in three</text>
  <text start="1018.9" dur="6.63">weeks how many cases a 25 grand do you</text>
  <text start="1022.23" dur="6.75">need I hate devil&amp;#39;s advocate for just a</text>
  <text start="1025.53" dur="4.77">second because while I think that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1028.98" dur="3.18">right that this is an issue that these</text>
  <text start="1030.3" dur="5.039">groups are giving the wrong solutions</text>
  <text start="1032.16" dur="5.1">you know groups out there where the</text>
  <text start="1035.339" dur="3.571">fathers have had maybe lost custody</text>
  <text start="1037.26" dur="3.51">wrongly two women that were abusive of</text>
  <text start="1038.91" dur="4.32">the system so I don&amp;#39;t want to give those</text>
  <text start="1040.77" dur="4.26">folks a little bit of an ear let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="1043.23" dur="3.089">about the next topic those are real</text>
  <text start="1045.03" dur="3.78">issues I just want to say that</text>
  <text start="1046.319" dur="4.591">oftentimes this is a good example the</text>
  <text start="1048.81" dur="4.04">the group solution for something or the</text>
  <text start="1050.91" dur="4.38">government solution for something The</text>
  <text start="1052.85" dur="5.2">Cure&amp;#39;s worse than the poison in some</text>
  <text start="1055.29" dur="6.21">cases I just want to get that right</text>
  <text start="1058.05" dur="6.36">that&amp;#39;s absolutely right be what I found</text>
  <text start="1061.5" dur="6.39">what&amp;#39;s really ironic and this is how how</text>
  <text start="1064.41" dur="6.93">corrupt the system is it&amp;#39;s as easy to</text>
  <text start="1067.89" dur="6.54">hide real abuse as it is to falsely</text>
  <text start="1071.34" dur="4.92">accuse someone and the victim of a false</text>
  <text start="1074.43" dur="4.14">allegation is primarily the man though I</text>
  <text start="1076.26" dur="4.67">do find a lot of women get falsely</text>
  <text start="1078.57" dur="4.71">accused of abuse in and variety of ways</text>
  <text start="1080.93" dur="5.23">it&amp;#39;s usually like she won&amp;#39;t leave me</text>
  <text start="1083.28" dur="4.89">alone she calls morning day night it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1086.16" dur="4.46">not necessarily the physical abuse I</text>
  <text start="1088.17" dur="5.57">mean minutes often times the</text>
  <text start="1090.62" dur="4.86">the new men that are mystically more</text>
  <text start="1093.74" dur="3.419">abusive than even a biological father</text>
  <text start="1095.48" dur="4.86">would be so a lot of times the child</text>
  <text start="1097.159" dur="5.821">abuse enters from like a boyfriend</text>
  <text start="1100.34" dur="5.819">boyfriend correct that can happen as</text>
  <text start="1102.98" dur="5.309">well and one of the reasons that false</text>
  <text start="1106.159" dur="4.23">allegations of abuse especially against</text>
  <text start="1108.289" dur="5.46">men as easy as there&amp;#39;s a law called the</text>
  <text start="1110.389" dur="5.701">Violence Against Women Act which was the</text>
  <text start="1113.749" dur="5.611">brainchild of Jill Biden you may have</text>
  <text start="1116.09" dur="5.549">heard of him and he won&amp;#39;t he I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1119.36" dur="4.139">not gonna overdo it he&amp;#39;s not gonna make</text>
  <text start="1121.639" dur="4.591">this the centerpiece of his campaign but</text>
  <text start="1123.499" dur="6.12">you will hear him because on the surface</text>
  <text start="1126.23" dur="5.73">he claims that it protects abused women</text>
  <text start="1129.619" dur="5.31">so to get the women bowed he&amp;#39;s gonna say</text>
  <text start="1131.96" dur="3.839">I promote help promote the Violence</text>
  <text start="1134.929" dur="3.63">Against Women Act</text>
  <text start="1135.799" dur="4.801">what it did was it nationalized the</text>
  <text start="1138.559" dur="4.921">mastic violence which is a local issue</text>
  <text start="1140.6" dur="5.909">if you&amp;#39;re beating up your wife the local</text>
  <text start="1143.48" dur="5.939">cops in your house so if you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1146.509" dur="5.25">savior&amp;#39; Ohio well</text>
  <text start="1149.419" dur="5.281">Xavier police are probably the best</text>
  <text start="1151.759" dur="4.321">situated to investigate your domestic</text>
  <text start="1154.7" dur="3.599">violence if you&amp;#39;re hitting a wife and a</text>
  <text start="1156.08" dur="4.62">house and Xavier it nationalized that</text>
  <text start="1158.299" dur="4.411">but once again what would happen is the</text>
  <text start="1160.7" dur="4.62">states would get money for each of these</text>
  <text start="1162.71" dur="4.5">cases so all of these and it was not the</text>
  <text start="1165.32" dur="3.719">states this time there&amp;#39;s all these</text>
  <text start="1167.21" dur="4.919">groups like domestic violence shelters</text>
  <text start="1169.039" dur="4.71">popped up everywhere they so woman a</text>
  <text start="1172.129" dur="5.221">comes into a domestic violence shelter</text>
  <text start="1173.749" dur="5.37">and she tells a story they will get more</text>
  <text start="1177.35" dur="5.309">money if they believe her because now</text>
  <text start="1179.119" dur="5.43">number one she needs a search she needs</text>
  <text start="1182.659" dur="4.921">housing you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re a victim of them</text>
  <text start="1184.549" dur="4.411">obviously can&amp;#39;t stay there well they get</text>
  <text start="1187.58" dur="3.419">grants for the housing if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1188.96" dur="3.27">believe her you don&amp;#39;t house her and then</text>
  <text start="1190.999" dur="3.481">you don&amp;#39;t get the grant you need a</text>
  <text start="1192.23" dur="4.23">lawyer and they usually farm that out</text>
  <text start="1194.48" dur="4.97">and the lawyer gets paid through babba</text>
  <text start="1196.46" dur="6.24">there&amp;#39;s you can get them then they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1199.45" dur="6.099">often the solution is a protective order</text>
  <text start="1202.7" dur="5.219">and then the protective order with it</text>
  <text start="1205.549" dur="5.85">there are classes the man has to go to</text>
  <text start="1207.919" dur="5.941">like like a B and C in order to get rid</text>
  <text start="1211.399" dur="5.581">of the protective order and all of those</text>
  <text start="1213.86" dur="6.269">get money so like the class that you as</text>
  <text start="1216.98" dur="4.74">the man go to they have a pays for them</text>
  <text start="1220.129" dur="3.841">to put the class on you can just imagine</text>
  <text start="1221.72" dur="4.71">the</text>
  <text start="1223.97" dur="6">blowing information you&amp;#39;re gonna learn</text>
  <text start="1226.43" dur="6.36">these classes so all of these people are</text>
  <text start="1229.97" dur="5.82">making money so the whole incentive is</text>
  <text start="1232.79" dur="6.42">to come up with a false allegation of</text>

  <text start="1245.77" dur="6.1">how much of the money do you think is</text>
  <text start="1248.47" dur="6.88">going toward for female victims and</text>
  <text start="1251.87" dur="4.62">there is currently a lawsuit out there</text>

  <text start="1328.55" dur="6.21">one interesting thing about both of the</text>
  <text start="1330.86" dur="6.75">LA and fatherhood gov is the same groups</text>
  <text start="1334.76" dur="5.58">who pushed for the legislation now</text>
  <text start="1337.61" dur="5.82">benefit from it so with their WA it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1340.34" dur="5.13">all the feminists it&amp;#39;s it is now</text>
  <text start="1343.43" dur="4.71">National Organization for Women guess</text>
  <text start="1345.47" dur="6.72">money but it&amp;#39;s mostly more like local</text>
  <text start="1348.14" dur="6.51">versions of now but feminists said we</text>
  <text start="1352.19" dur="4.82">need this law and then suddenly feminist</text>
  <text start="1354.65" dur="4.43">groups get</text>
  <text start="1357.01" dur="4.56">get all the grant funding and with</text>
  <text start="1359.08" dur="4.83">fatherhood.gov was the father&amp;#39;s rights</text>
  <text start="1361.57" dur="3.81">group who said they need the law and it</text>
  <text start="1363.91" dur="4.259">just so happens to be like father</text>
  <text start="1365.38" dur="5.01">father&amp;#39;s rights people and there&amp;#39;s a guy</text>
  <text start="1368.169" dur="5.541">named Jeffrey lemming who&amp;#39;s in Illinois</text>
  <text start="1370.39" dur="6.81">here in Chicago in fact a well-known</text>
  <text start="1373.71" dur="5.589">father&amp;#39;s rights lawyer who depending on</text>
  <text start="1377.2" dur="5.91">who you talk to or what his what his</text>
  <text start="1379.299" dur="7.921">reputation is but he gets some some of</text>
  <text start="1383.11" dur="5.819">this fatherhood funds so that and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1387.22" dur="4.17">not just loving living is one example</text>
  <text start="1388.929" dur="4.081">but it&amp;#39;s loving and and like ten guys</text>
  <text start="1391.39" dur="3.75">not as well-known as loving but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1393.01" dur="3.78">all so the father&amp;#39;s rights people say we</text>
  <text start="1395.14" dur="2.76">needed and then the father&amp;#39;s rights</text>
  <text start="1396.79" dur="2.7">people are the ones who are the grant</text>
  <text start="1397.9" dur="3.42">funds consent</text>
  <text start="1399.49" dur="5.13">yeah like that&amp;#39;s not a conflict of</text>
  <text start="1401.32" dur="5.25">interest and you have incentives to take</text>
  <text start="1404.62" dur="3.9">kids put them into foster care and adopt</text>
  <text start="1406.57" dur="4.32">them out you have other incentives to</text>
  <text start="1408.52" dur="4.92">place kids with abusive men you have</text>
  <text start="1410.89" dur="5.159">still other incentives to believe</text>
  <text start="1413.44" dur="4.89">completely bogus allegations of abuse</text>
  <text start="1416.049" dur="4.951">because you&amp;#39;ll get money for believing</text>
  <text start="1418.33" dur="5.64">that that is the the ultimate conflict</text>
  <text start="1421" dur="5.58">of interest is you are paid to believe</text>
  <text start="1423.97" dur="5.55">this just like with fatherhood.gov you</text>
  <text start="1426.58" dur="5.58">are essentially paid to believe that</text>
  <text start="1429.52" dur="4.17">that they were being coached because if</text>
  <text start="1432.16" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re not being coached and the court</text>
  <text start="1433.69" dur="5.01">professionals don&amp;#39;t need to be involved</text>
  <text start="1435.34" dur="7.079">so they they get more money the more</text>
  <text start="1438.7" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re involved yes so uh all of these</text>
  <text start="1442.419" dur="4.89">are perverse incentives and the answer</text>
  <text start="1444.61" dur="4.8">is simple but not easy you eliminate</text>
  <text start="1447.309" dur="5.551">Social Security title for you eliminate</text>
  <text start="1449.41" dur="5.519">CAPTA you eliminate s for you sunset</text>

  <text start="1461.559" dur="5.311">during Trump that&amp;#39;s been that&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="1465.19" dur="4.59">opportunity to at least remind people</text>
  <text start="1466.87" dur="4.77">that before these things for these like</text>
  <text start="1469.78" dur="3.66">government programs to take care of kids</text>
  <text start="1471.64" dur="4.26">or battered women or any de sóller stuff</text>
  <text start="1473.44" dur="3.72">charity groups mostly religious groups</text>
  <text start="1475.9" dur="3">would take care of that and they did a</text>
  <text start="1477.16" dur="4.35">better job in ninety percent of these</text>
  <text start="1478.9" dur="6.149">cases then because they think the gross</text>
  <text start="1481.51" dur="7.11">incentives family and friends as well</text>
  <text start="1485.049" dur="6.711">you&amp;#39;re right you&amp;#39;re absolutely right</text>
  <text start="1488.62" dur="7.38">this government solves every problem</text>
  <text start="1491.76" dur="7.27">badly you get rid of all of that but it</text>
  <text start="1496" dur="7.89">is it&amp;#39;s simple because the solutions are</text>
  <text start="1499.03" dur="8.37">simple but you&amp;#39;ll be attacked as you</text>
  <text start="1503.89" dur="6.54">like abusers you want kids to stay in</text>
  <text start="1507.4" dur="5.85">dangerous situations you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1510.43" dur="4.35">fathers to be in the kids lives this is</text>
  <text start="1513.25" dur="6.54">the kind of stuff you&amp;#39;ll be attacked</text>
  <text start="1514.78" dur="9">with so it&amp;#39;s not easy simple but not</text>
  <text start="1519.79" dur="7.769">easy and so those are those are I&amp;#39;d say</text>
  <text start="1523.78" dur="5.75">the solutions yeah can you hear me yeah</text>
  <text start="1527.559" dur="4.411">I think we&amp;#39;re having a delay maybe</text>
  <text start="1529.53" dur="4.63">there&amp;#39;s a real fast there&amp;#39;s a good quote</text>
  <text start="1531.97" dur="4.38">I don&amp;#39;t know exactly how it goes but the</text>
  <text start="1534.16" dur="3.78">Socialists basically would want everyone</text>
  <text start="1536.35" dur="2.97">to starve if we did not want the</text>
  <text start="1537.94" dur="4.41">government to grow the food something</text>
  <text start="1539.32" dur="8.28">like that and kind of exactly what</text>
  <text start="1542.35" dur="8.579">you&amp;#39;re saying so I continue right all of</text>
  <text start="1547.6" dur="6.57">this the Nexus is based on this idea</text>
  <text start="1550.929" dur="7.581">that government can solve every problem</text>
  <text start="1554.17" dur="8.37">that especially in federal government</text>
  <text start="1558.51" dur="6.7">and the other party is that domestic</text>
  <text start="1562.54" dur="6.18">violence became a public hazard that</text>
  <text start="1565.21" dur="7.26">there was so much of it that we needed a</text>
  <text start="1568.72" dur="6.02">federal solution so it&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="1572.47" dur="6.03">based on that philosophy and if you</text>
  <text start="1574.74" dur="5.41">recall in San Juan &amp;#39;td what esfir did</text>
  <text start="1578.5" dur="3.3">because he thought too many of these</text>
  <text start="1580.15" dur="4.71">kids were in foster care</text>
  <text start="1581.8" dur="5.49">so we need to get him adopted out so he</text>
  <text start="1584.86" dur="3.84">he may not have seen the problem from</text>
  <text start="1587.29" dur="5.94">his beginning but he wanted more</text>
  <text start="1588.7" dur="7.41">adoptions from foster care right so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1593.23" dur="4.89">to be trafficked right well he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1596.11" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;m sure he didn&amp;#39;t see it that way his</text>
  <text start="1598.12" dur="4.26">thought was well they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1600.4" dur="4.08">always in foster care so much better to</text>
  <text start="1602.38" dur="4.79">get him adopted out no one thinks that</text>
  <text start="1604.48" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re being taken out of their parents</text>
  <text start="1607.17" dur="5.2">because unnecessarily shouldn&amp;#39;t has</text>
  <text start="1611.17" dur="4.139">actually been linked to numerous</text>
  <text start="1612.37" dur="4.38">incidences of alleged at least human</text>
  <text start="1615.309" dur="4.501">trafficking especially that of children</text>
  <text start="1616.75" dur="4.99">examples being like in China and others</text>
  <text start="1619.81" dur="3.64">so that this could have gone</text>
  <text start="1621.74" dur="3.689">back who knows how long and maybe these</text>
  <text start="1623.45" dur="4.56">laws are actually set up for this</text>
  <text start="1625.429" dur="7.191">purpose right it almost doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="1628.01" dur="7.83">because that&amp;#39;s the outcome is that you</text>

  <text start="1635.84" dur="3.99">happening so the last thing that I</text>
  <text start="1638.059" dur="4.561">wanted to talk about was the rookie case</text>

  <text start="2231.08" dur="8.25">can give you know number one I the</text>
  <text start="2234.74" dur="6.18">judges the the judge the the only the</text>
  <text start="2239.33" dur="3.6">only conclusion I can come up with based</text>
  <text start="2240.92" dur="5.19">on their rulings is that they&amp;#39;ve all</text>
  <text start="2242.93" dur="4.2">been bought off so there are two appeals</text>
  <text start="2246.11" dur="3.45">judge here I&amp;#39;ll give you the evidence</text>
  <text start="2247.13" dur="4.2">there&amp;#39;s two appeals judges one is named</text>

  <text start="2261.8" dur="4.53">rucky every single time every single</text>
  <text start="2264.47" dur="4.7">time now I&amp;#39;m supposed to believe what</text>
  <text start="2266.33" dur="5.25">that she every single time had the worst</text>
  <text start="2269.17" dur="6.97">argument and that&amp;#39;s where they ruled</text>
  <text start="2271.58" dur="7.65">against the the judge as I said he gave</text>
  <text start="2276.14" dur="5.01">David rocky everything and he ordered</text>

  <text start="2281.15" dur="4.63">let her see her kids so what what is the</text>
  <text start="2284.39" dur="4.96">conclusion they</text>
  <text start="2285.78" dur="6.27">manipulated the way she was arrested all</text>
  <text start="2289.35" dur="6.87">sorts of things it&amp;#39;s all a part of this</text>
  <text start="2292.05" dur="6.33">racketeering enterprise but I it&amp;#39;s it it</text>
  <text start="2296.22" dur="3.68">requires federal prosecutors to think</text>
  <text start="2298.38" dur="4.47">outside the box because they&amp;#39;ve never</text>

  <text start="2324.63" dur="5.34">this is my opinion we&amp;#39;ve seen a lot more</text>

  <text start="2410.31" dur="3.51">way you think they will the other thing</text>
  <text start="2412.08" dur="4.89">is it was supposed to go into effect in</text>
  <text start="2413.82" dur="5.19">October of 2020 so last month only one</text>
  <text start="2416.97" dur="2.67">in four states have actually implemented</text>
  <text start="2419.01" dur="3.3">the</text>
  <text start="2419.64" dur="5.16">the ones have received these waivers so</text>
  <text start="2422.31" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s a question of if and when any of</text>
  <text start="2424.8" dur="4.08">these states will actually implement it</text>
  <text start="2426.42" dur="4.77">anyway but he is that was one of the</text>
  <text start="2428.88" dur="5.04">first things he actually did though it I</text>
  <text start="2431.19" dur="4.64">don&amp;#39;t know if it fixes the problem it</text>
  <text start="2433.92" dur="4.02">fixes it probably at the margins however</text>
  <text start="2435.83" dur="5.11">really because it only got implemented</text>
  <text start="2437.94" dur="4.32">in October of 2020 it remains to be seen</text>
  <text start="2440.94" dur="3.84">and it&amp;#39;s something that you and others</text>
  <text start="2442.26" dur="4.05">should cover how does the family first</text>
  <text start="2444.78" dur="4.38">act get implemented because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2446.31" dur="4.65">exactly what he passed and what he</text>
  <text start="2449.16" dur="3.99">signed into law which is supposed to</text>
  <text start="2450.96" dur="5.4">help some of these things I did not</text>
  <text start="2453.15" dur="5.58">however get rid of fatherhood.gov he has</text>
  <text start="2456.36" dur="4.14">not resigned that ISO on that level he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2458.73" dur="3.69">doing well and in my opinion he should</text>
  <text start="2460.5" dur="4.68">sunset all of Social Security I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2462.42" dur="4.95">four and I should mention David rucky</text>
  <text start="2465.18" dur="4.05">gets money through Social Security title</text>
  <text start="2467.37" dur="4.44">for two right now chase after his</text>
  <text start="2469.23" dur="5.1">ex-wife it actually says it in the child</text>
  <text start="2471.81" dur="4.32">support order david rocky gets money</text>
  <text start="2474.33" dur="4.35">through Social Security title 40 this is</text>
  <text start="2476.13" dur="4.41">a guy with multiple homes multiple cars</text>
  <text start="2478.68" dur="4.5">and a multi-million dollar business and</text>
  <text start="2480.54" dur="4.77">somehow he qualifies for money under</text>
  <text start="2483.18" dur="4.17">Social Security title 40 I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2485.31" dur="5.64">wise where if you know the judge or</text>
  <text start="2487.35" dur="6.81">something explained it is it&amp;#39;s not means</text>
  <text start="2490.95" dur="5.67">us take me almost i got an explanation</text>
  <text start="2494.16" dur="4.53">if the i said in front of me but at one</text>
  <text start="2496.62" dur="5.1">point they sort of explained it if you</text>
  <text start="2498.69" dur="4.92">can prove you need help getting the</text>
  <text start="2501.72" dur="3.87">money it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much money</text>
  <text start="2503.61" dur="8.84">you make you just need help getting the</text>
  <text start="2505.59" dur="9.63">money but obviously stocks and i can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2512.45" dur="4.84">right but but you would think the guy</text>
  <text start="2515.22" dur="4.32">with four homes is not the one who would</text>
  <text start="2517.29" dur="3.33">get the money under the program it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2519.54" dur="4.5">guy who is living in a one-bedroom</text>
  <text start="2520.62" dur="5.61">apartment who needs you know the $400 a</text>
  <text start="2524.04" dur="8.13">month is really going to help to keep</text>
  <text start="2526.23" dur="8.31">the kid here right and by the way he has</text>
  <text start="2532.17" dur="5.19">a lawyer for the last eight years her</text>
  <text start="2534.54" dur="6.06">name is Lisa Elliot who litigates these</text>
  <text start="2537.36" dur="5.55">things so if you have a lawyer how is it</text>
  <text start="2540.6" dur="4.34">that you need the child support money</text>
  <text start="2542.91" dur="4.41">the amount of child support is</text>
  <text start="2544.94" dur="3.88">significantly less than what he pays the</text>
  <text start="2547.32" dur="4.02">lawyer every month none of it actually</text>
  <text start="2548.82" dur="4.8">makes sense and by the way he&amp;#39;s suing</text>
  <text start="2551.34" dur="4.95">people because now that he</text>
  <text start="2553.62" dur="4.83">one everything anyone who ever claimed</text>
  <text start="2556.29" dur="5.55">he was abusive is getting a lawsuit so</text>
  <text start="2558.45" dur="5.58">he&amp;#39;s trying to get over 400,000 from an</text>
  <text start="2561.84" dur="4.11">insurance company at the same time he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2564.03" dur="4.32">saying he needs $200 that&amp;#39;s how much it</text>
  <text start="2565.95" dur="5.82">is it&amp;#39;s like children $15 a month in</text>
  <text start="2568.35" dur="5.73">child support the the problem is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2571.77" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;ve tracked her back for so long</text>
  <text start="2574.08" dur="4.68">that she&amp;#39;s over ten grand in arrears so</text>
  <text start="2576.75" dur="3.6">even if she were to pay the monthly it</text>
  <text start="2578.76" dur="3.21">gets still put her in jail I think the</text>
  <text start="2580.35" dur="4.59">whole thing is done just to put her in</text>
  <text start="2581.97" dur="5.9">jail but he the the amount each he pays</text>
  <text start="2584.94" dur="6">his lawyer per month is more than the</text>
  <text start="2587.87" dur="4.54">$215 he would collect anyway so how much</text>
  <text start="2590.94" dur="3.57">does he need it if there&amp;#39;s enough money</text>
  <text start="2592.41" dur="3.75">for the lawyer you think the modern</text>
  <text start="2594.51" dur="3">debtors prison something that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2596.16" dur="3.09">supposed to have gotten rid of now and</text>
  <text start="2597.51" dur="4.17">you can go to jail for money that you</text>
  <text start="2599.25" dur="5.55">don&amp;#39;t really owe in many cases like this</text>
  <text start="2601.68" dur="5.67">one so Mikey thank you so much I really</text>
  <text start="2604.8" dur="4.86">appreciate your time and I you know I</text>
  <text start="2607.35" dur="3.75">this has been very enlightening and a</text>
  <text start="2609.66" dur="3.15">lot of people care about this issue very</text>
  <text start="2611.1" dur="4.47">deeply many of them know someone who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2612.81" dur="5.04">been impacted I I recently did an</text>
  <text start="2615.57" dur="3.81">interview with a Rachel Bruno who&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="2617.85" dur="3.72">through this herself and she&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="2619.38" dur="4.29">beat the system and versus one of hope</text>
  <text start="2621.57" dur="4.38">but you know there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s many others</text>
  <text start="2623.67" dur="4.44">out there who are just in the darkest</text>
  <text start="2625.95" dur="4.98">place imagine you know what&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="2628.11" dur="6.11">about Rachel&amp;#39;s story is it&amp;#39;s so similar</text>
  <text start="2630.93" dur="6.21">to others and she has complete victory</text>
  <text start="2634.22" dur="5.14">others who are who tell the same story</text>
  <text start="2637.14" dur="3.63">but I&amp;#39;m still fighting for my kids in</text>
  <text start="2639.36" dur="1.95">the back here mine what are you not</text>
  <text start="2640.77" dur="3.3">telling me</text>
  <text start="2641.31" dur="4.35">well Rachel told you the exact same</text>
  <text start="2644.07" dur="3.57">story and it turned out there was</text>
  <text start="2645.66" dur="3.48">nothing she wasn&amp;#39;t telling you and she</text>
  <text start="2647.64" dur="3.09">won and not only did she win</text>
  <text start="2649.14" dur="3.75">she won from three different entities</text>
  <text start="2650.73" dur="4.83">the cops did wrong the hospital did</text>
  <text start="2652.89" dur="4.38">wrong and CPS they all did wrong and her</text>
  <text start="2655.56" dur="4.89">story is very similar you&amp;#39;re right it is</text>
  <text start="2657.27" dur="6.03">hope but also very similar except for</text>
  <text start="2660.45" dur="5.46">the ending so they&amp;#39;re not making it up</text>
  <text start="2663.3" dur="6.75">it absolutely happens it happens a lot</text>
  <text start="2665.91" dur="6.42">and she is one of the lucky ones and and</text>
  <text start="2670.05" dur="2.61">and she&amp;#39;s been able to expose it to some</text>
  <text start="2672.33" dur="2.94">degree</text>
  <text start="2672.66" dur="4.05">and by the way her attorney is one of</text>
  <text start="2675.27" dur="6.06">the best attorneys in the country and</text>
  <text start="2676.71" dur="6.81">she put his depositions online so if</text>
  <text start="2681.33" dur="6.2">you&amp;#39;re into that stuff it&amp;#39;s amazing</text>
  <text start="2683.52" dur="4.01">watching him work them over and</text>
  <text start="2687.56" dur="6.4">the best was he had text messages that</text>
  <text start="2691.47" dur="5.49">proved that the social worker from CPS</text>
  <text start="2693.96" dur="5.61">having done absolutely no work was</text>
  <text start="2696.96" dur="4.23">already suspecting the mom Rachel and</text>
  <text start="2699.57" dur="3.299">that was one of the reasons why they</text>
  <text start="2701.19" dur="2.64">took the kid because before she had</text>
  <text start="2702.869" dur="2.701">talked to anyone</text>
  <text start="2703.83" dur="4.47">she was already suspecting that Rachel</text>
  <text start="2705.57" dur="4.32">did it and he asked her the question and</text>
  <text start="2708.3" dur="4.47">she tried to deny it she was like no I</text>
  <text start="2709.89" dur="4.92">didn&amp;#39;t he&amp;#39;s like you didn&amp;#39;t but and he</text>
  <text start="2712.77" dur="4.11">went through number one he asked her the</text>
  <text start="2714.81" dur="4.89">question three times just to like stick</text>
  <text start="2716.88" dur="6.09">the knife in her and then goes but you</text>
  <text start="2719.7" dur="7.08">said at this time in this text message</text>
  <text start="2722.97" dur="6.33">so in fact you did think at the time of</text>
  <text start="2726.78" dur="4.65">the text message cuz she in her text</text>
  <text start="2729.3" dur="3.96">message I think she said think mom so</text>
  <text start="2731.43" dur="3.45">after he got her to deny that she</text>
  <text start="2733.26" dur="4.32">thought the mom was doing it at that</text>
  <text start="2734.88" dur="5.82">moment he he then asked her three times</text>
  <text start="2737.58" dur="4.74">and then went through the text and he</text>
  <text start="2740.7" dur="4.2">works them over really well and you can</text>
  <text start="2742.32" dur="6.09">see there the corruption and competence</text>
  <text start="2744.9" dur="5.79">just come out during the questioning but</text>
  <text start="2748.41" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s a very important case because she</text>
  <text start="2750.69" dur="4.29">did win and it&amp;#39;s very similar to others</text>
  <text start="2753.3" dur="4.68">and that&amp;#39;s one reason why you should</text>
  <text start="2754.98" dur="6.99">believe the others because her facts are</text>
  <text start="2757.98" dur="4.98">very similar others microfi I really</text>
