  <text start="144.89" dur="5.22">the Nestle situation here now I on this</text>
  <text start="148.4" dur="2.62">channel I try to bring you trends I try</text>
  <text start="150.11" dur="2.68">to bring you</text>
  <text start="151.02" dur="4.62">kind of what&amp;#39;s happening overall with</text>
  <text start="152.79" dur="4.83">the big picture the war of good and evil</text>
  <text start="155.64" dur="4.05">sometimes it feels like but you know</text>
  <text start="157.62" dur="3.57">economics health and and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="159.69" dur="3.36">happening kind of with the great</text>
  <text start="161.19" dur="4.44">financial reset or the everything bubble</text>
  <text start="163.05" dur="5.55">and of course corruption politics where</text>
  <text start="165.63" dur="5.46">I spend a lot of my time now this is a</text>
  <text start="168.6" dur="5.88">bit of everything all rolled into one it</text>
  <text start="171.09" dur="5.67">involves the courts involves corruption</text>
  <text start="174.48" dur="5.19">it involves hism decades of corruption</text>
  <text start="176.76" dur="6.14">it involves Monsanto&amp;#39;s glyphosate or</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="5.7">glyphosate and it involves you know</text>
  <text start="182.9" dur="5.59">economics I mean this is uh Nestle here</text>
  <text start="185.37" dur="5.67">so and Monsanto owned by Bayer now are</text>
  <text start="188.49" dur="4.83">also fairly big players in the you know</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="5.19">the economic space now my point in</text>
  <text start="193.32" dur="4.65">bringing all this together is you may or</text>
  <text start="196.23" dur="4.77">may not have heard I reported on this</text>
  <text start="197.97" dur="4.74">channel that Monsanto is finally getting</text>
  <text start="201" dur="4.47">hit for hundreds of millions of dollars</text>
  <text start="202.71" dur="4.47">for the cancer and disease that they are</text>
  <text start="205.47" dur="4.44">spreading with their product everywhere</text>
  <text start="207.18" dur="5.1">now finally it&amp;#39;s getting through the</text>
  <text start="209.91" dur="3.78">courts now I I am NOT shocked that</text>
  <text start="212.28" dur="3.02">that&amp;#39;s happening under Trump&amp;#39;s watch I</text>
  <text start="213.69" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t know if he&amp;#39;s directly involved but</text>
  <text start="215.3" dur="4.93">it&amp;#39;s amazing to see real consequences</text>
  <text start="218.52" dur="3.72">for some of these evil actors within the</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="4.35">marketplace I mean that gives me hope</text>
  <text start="222.24" dur="4.17">for things like vaccines and and in</text>
  <text start="224.58" dur="4.17">actual safety studies and and and</text>
  <text start="226.41" dur="4.14">holding those accountable who have moved</text>
  <text start="228.75" dur="4.8">done what they have already done to</text>
  <text start="230.55" dur="5.37">children and and our whole planet with</text>
  <text start="233.55" dur="5.37">these terrible terrible vaccines</text>
  <text start="235.92" dur="5.13">however it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s interesting to see</text>
  <text start="238.92" dur="4.95">what the big guys are doing now Nestle</text>
  <text start="241.05" dur="5.19">is another big player now Nestle is</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="5.1">paying attention to what&amp;#39;s happening to</text>
  <text start="246.24" dur="4.29">Monsanto at least I think because they</text>
  <text start="248.97" dur="4.11">are now starting to step up their</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="5.79">testing after they found high levels of</text>
  <text start="253.08" dur="5.37">the dangerous glyphosate weed killer so</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="4.08">they see the writing on the wall and I</text>
  <text start="258.45" dur="4.56">suspect that we will start to see other</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="4.98">companies following suit now you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="263.01" dur="4.47">put this in people you can&amp;#39;t just turn a</text>
  <text start="265.38" dur="4.53">blind eye while you&amp;#39;re poisoning people</text>
  <text start="267.48" dur="5.01">and it&amp;#39;s not just this it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="269.91" dur="4.02">glyphosate it&amp;#39;s all of the different</text>
  <text start="272.49" dur="2.85">things that they&amp;#39;re putting into the</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="3.48">food products you know from the</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="3.98">radiation of the products themselves to</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="3.41">the fluoride and</text>
  <text start="279.32" dur="5.1">heavy metals and all the other</text>
  <text start="280.82" dur="6.36">contaminants so this is a good strong</text>
  <text start="284.42" dur="4.02">trend this is a strong trend I think in</text>
  <text start="287.18" dur="2.61">the right direction because once you</text>
  <text start="288.44" dur="2.55">start bringing in hundreds of millions</text>
  <text start="289.79" dur="3.78">of dollars of losses</text>
  <text start="290.99" dur="6.57">I guess you start getting some level of</text>
  <text start="293.57" dur="5.79">reaction and leverage is you know a very</text>
  <text start="297.56" dur="4.32">powerful tool in this world I would I</text>
  <text start="299.36" dur="5.79">would I would argue that President Trump</text>
  <text start="301.88" dur="6.47">has used that in the art of war you know</text>
  <text start="305.15" dur="5.76">the art of the deal quite a bit himself</text>
  <text start="308.35" dur="4.42">example with Mexico where there there</text>
  <text start="310.91" dur="3.51">finally and South American countries are</text>
  <text start="312.77" dur="4.08">finally coming around after he&amp;#39;s cutting</text>
  <text start="314.42" dur="4.44">off funds and and using leverage and</text>
  <text start="316.85" dur="4.59">threatening them economically if they</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="4.43">don&amp;#39;t secure their borders against these</text>
  <text start="321.44" dur="3.96">folks coming in with you know all the</text>
  <text start="323.29" dur="4.96">millions of illegal immigrants we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="325.4" dur="6.18">gonna get to that as well but you know</text>
  <text start="328.25" dur="6.3">an example of leverage leverages power</text>
  <text start="331.58" dur="5.4">leverage gets things done now I also</text>
  <text start="334.55" dur="5.1">want to jump over to Trump talking about</text>
  <text start="336.98" dur="6.06">little with DS you know little not</text>
  <text start="339.65" dur="4.92">little but little it&amp;#39;s hard to say and</text>
  <text start="343.04" dur="3.03">it&amp;#39;s probably hard to to hear the</text>
  <text start="344.57" dur="4.65">difference as well with my southern</text>
  <text start="346.07" dur="6.15">accent so Adam Schiff little Adam Schiff</text>
  <text start="349.22" dur="5.31">is on the hot seat for unsuccessfully</text>
  <text start="352.22" dur="4.11">working to hurt the GOP and of course</text>
  <text start="354.53" dur="2.6">President Trump for the past three years</text>
  <text start="356.33" dur="4.32">smell</text>
  <text start="357.13" dur="5.02">we know from you know the queuing</text>
  <text start="360.65" dur="3">movement and the the research that has</text>
  <text start="362.15" dur="3.42">come out of that the citizen journalists</text>
  <text start="363.65" dur="3.63">research that has come out of that that</text>
  <text start="365.57" dur="4.65">there are unanswered questions around</text>
  <text start="367.28" dur="5.81">the standard hotel and a murder and Adam</text>
  <text start="370.22" dur="5.28">Schiff and we also have some you know</text>
  <text start="373.09" dur="5.16">allegations of pedophilic behavior in</text>
  <text start="375.5" dur="5.28">his own background so we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="378.25" dur="4.99">everything that we don&amp;#39;t know about this</text>
  <text start="380.78" dur="4.56">character yet but we do know as q is</text>
  <text start="383.24" dur="5.64">often said those who scream the loudest</text>
  <text start="385.34" dur="5.07">are often the dirtiest so they have the</text>
  <text start="388.88" dur="3.09">most high that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="390.41" dur="4.71">leading the charge against President</text>
  <text start="391.97" dur="6.66">Trump with nothing but lies and this is</text>
  <text start="395.12" dur="6.21">one of the frontrunners he is barreling</text>
  <text start="398.63" dur="5.67">through trying to you know you&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="401.33" dur="5.1">his his recent phony conversation that</text>
  <text start="404.3" dur="4.29">he made up just to try to make Trump</text>
  <text start="406.43" dur="3.25">look bad right in the halls of Congress</text>
  <text start="408.59" dur="4.09">it I mean it was</text>
  <text start="409.68" dur="5.37">it was brazen and it was and it was</text>
  <text start="412.68" dur="5.16">ridiculous honestly and people laughed</text>
  <text start="415.05" dur="4.44">at him and I think so here we go</text>
  <text start="417.84" dur="5.31">continuing on</text>
  <text start="419.49" dur="5.91">you know this I&amp;#39;m not saying anything is</text>
  <text start="423.15" dur="4.079">a facts I&amp;#39;m saying we have questions</text>
  <text start="425.4" dur="4.53">that we need answered about the standard</text>
  <text start="427.229" dur="5.671">hotel atom shifts involvement and the</text>
  <text start="429.93" dur="5.489">cover-up of death so you know beyond</text>
  <text start="432.9" dur="4.079">that I just wanted to to kind of let you</text>
  <text start="435.419" dur="4.171">know that Trump is turning the heat on</text>
  <text start="436.979" dur="4.681">him finally and the fact that he would</text>
  <text start="439.59" dur="5.31">use this word little you know this is</text>
  <text start="441.66" dur="5.22">also a hat tip to the qa9 community we</text>
  <text start="444.9" dur="3.87">know what that means we know what little</text>
  <text start="446.88" dur="4.95">means and we know what the allegations</text>
  <text start="448.77" dur="4.95">against him and children are so you know</text>
  <text start="451.83" dur="4.41">for those who who don&amp;#39;t necessarily want</text>
  <text start="453.72" dur="5.55">to go down every rabbit hole that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="456.24" dur="5.7">just know that there are folks out there</text>
  <text start="459.27" dur="6.209">who hurt kids and there is a dedicated</text>
  <text start="461.94" dur="5.97">community out there looking up every</text>
  <text start="465.479" dur="4.5">rock under every stone to try to find</text>
  <text start="467.91" dur="5.999">them and to find evidence against them</text>
  <text start="469.979" dur="7.921">so there is a case being built for</text>
  <text start="473.909" dur="6.661">example in this case so continuing on we</text>
  <text start="477.9" dur="4.44">have Democrats actually giving us and in</text>
  <text start="480.57" dur="3.659">fact Bill Clinton but he&amp;#39;s really mad</text>
  <text start="482.34" dur="4.49">about this Hillary&amp;#39;s probably fuming and</text>
  <text start="484.229" dur="5.521">she&amp;#39;s coming back for a busy week of</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="4.019">speaking engagements apparently so be</text>
  <text start="489.75" dur="3.57">ready for anything</text>
  <text start="490.849" dur="4.391">pushing that the impeachment push</text>
  <text start="493.32" dur="4.29">probably I doubt she&amp;#39;ll try to run but</text>
  <text start="495.24" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="497.61" dur="4.649">so anyway Bill Clinton signed a treaty</text>
  <text start="499.8" dur="4.08">that actually allows for the kind of</text>
  <text start="502.259" dur="3.541">request that President Trump just did</text>
  <text start="503.88" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s completely legal it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="505.8" dur="4.02">lawful it involves the mutual</text>
  <text start="507.81" dur="5.37">cooperation of our law enforcement</text>
  <text start="509.82" dur="7.17">agencies and availability and you know</text>
  <text start="513.18" dur="4.739">that&amp;#39;s basically hilarious and it seems</text>
  <text start="516.99" dur="2.82">like President Trump</text>
  <text start="517.919" dur="3.93">always probably knows these things ahead</text>
  <text start="519.81" dur="3.84">of schedule I would imagine because he</text>
  <text start="521.849" dur="3.571">always has something that comes out</text>
  <text start="523.65" dur="4.11">within a few days right it&amp;#39;s always some</text>
  <text start="525.42" dur="4.32">other law or some past precedent or</text>
  <text start="527.76" dur="4.62">example with the Democrats did exactly</text>
  <text start="529.74" dur="4.11">what they&amp;#39;re accusing him of doing just</text>
  <text start="532.38" dur="3.36">like with Biden I mean immediately it</text>
  <text start="533.85" dur="4.17">came out that actually no it was the</text>
  <text start="535.74" dur="3.81">Democrats that had threatened Ukraine to</text>
  <text start="538.02" dur="4.6">withhold support if they didn&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="539.55" dur="4.84">investigate Trump so this is this is</text>
  <text start="542.62" dur="3.57">you get with their kind of ridiculous</text>
  <text start="544.39" dur="3.39">projection it&amp;#39;s always projection</text>
  <text start="546.19" dur="3.27">everything that they are doing they</text>
  <text start="547.78" dur="4.83">accuse their opponent of doing</text>
  <text start="549.46" dur="4.86">now speaking of hurting children Prince</text>
  <text start="552.61" dur="4.08">Andrew&amp;#39;s role in Geoffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="592.65" dur="4.81">that could absolutely include Andrews</text>
  <text start="595.51" dur="4.05">role or it could be that senior FBI</text>

  <text start="860.75" dur="5.61">this is bad this is bad for culture this</text>
  <text start="863.75" dur="4.11">is bad for society the crime rate that</text>

  <text start="867.86" dur="2.93">here illegally</text>
  <text start="868.67" dur="4.92">of course becoming criminals immediately</text>
  <text start="870.79" dur="6.1">but then also the crime that they bring</text>
  <text start="873.59" dur="4.92">statistically specifically illegal</text>
  <text start="876.89" dur="3.14">immigrants it&amp;#39;s not to be confused with</text>

  <text start="884.36" dur="4.38">guess just a different different mindset</text>
  <text start="887.03" dur="3.81">overall they they came the right way and</text>
  <text start="888.74" dur="5.76">they did it legally my wife is one of</text>
  <text start="890.84" dur="6.06">those from Taiwan so Taiwan hates China</text>
  <text start="894.5" dur="4.11">by the way just so you guys know China</text>
  <text start="896.9" dur="3.84">hates Taiwan - it&amp;#39;s actually kind of</text>

  <text start="905" dur="3.36">the map basically and take it over and</text>
  <text start="906.77" dur="3.75">the only thing stopping them is this</text>
  <text start="908.36" dur="4.32">president Trump&amp;#39;s friendship with Taiwan</text>
  <text start="910.52" dur="4.14">now you know we have defense treaties</text>

  <text start="924.23" dur="3.45">there are other countries now that are</text>
  <text start="925.85" dur="3.21">looking to trumpets as a leader of the</text>

  <text start="932.78" dur="4.14">another one of those potential</text>
  <text start="934.37" dur="4.77">candidates and you know just kind of a</text>
  <text start="936.92" dur="3.66">side topic from what we&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>
  <text start="939.14" dur="2.67">here with the illegal immigration and</text>
