  <text start="44.85" dur="3.18">adhesive deep divisions that are</text>
  <text start="46.41" dur="3.03">continuous in fighting between the</text>
  <text start="48.03" dur="3.15">Democrats and Republicans what do you</text>
  <text start="49.44" dur="4.549">think of all that we have to understand</text>
  <text start="51.18" dur="5.699">I think that for that generation</text>
  <text start="53.989" dur="5.531">capitalism hasn&amp;#39;t worked they&amp;#39;re in debt</text>
  <text start="56.879" dur="4.5">up to their ears with student loans the</text>
  <text start="59.52" dur="3.6">jobs aren&amp;#39;t there for them to use their</text>
  <text start="61.379" dur="4.621">talents and so they&amp;#39;re casting about</text>
  <text start="63.12" dur="5.4">searching for some alternative but of</text>

  <text start="73.83" dur="4.95">in technology and living standards that</text>
  <text start="76.32" dur="4.71">free capitalism but they don&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="78.78" dur="3.87">there was plans to enslave every</text>
  <text start="81.03" dur="3.36">American citizen that&amp;#39;s exactly where I</text>
  <text start="82.65" dur="3.36">think we&amp;#39;re coming to it just seems that</text>
  <text start="84.39" dur="3.96">the wealth is be going further and</text>
  <text start="86.01" dur="4.68">further into a finite point the rest of</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="4.199">us is getting sweeper and struggling</text>
  <text start="90.69" dur="3.9">harder and of course that that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="92.549" dur="4.921">to turn people&amp;#39;s minds to a a</text>
  <text start="94.59" dur="6.09">socialistic type of idea if you want</text>
  <text start="97.47" dur="4.5">blunt truth about Washington there</text>
  <text start="100.68" dur="3.38">aren&amp;#39;t any Republicans in Washington</text>
  <text start="101.97" dur="4.38">there aren&amp;#39;t any Democrats in Washington</text>
  <text start="104.06" dur="4.06">there&amp;#39;s just a bunch of people who have</text>
  <text start="106.35" dur="3.78">learned how to get rich off of politics</text>
  <text start="108.12" dur="4.32">people need to look beyond these a party</text>
  <text start="110.13" dur="3.84">lines is a smokescreen they no longer</text>
  <text start="112.44" dur="3.93">really exist I think it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="113.97" dur="4.86">shameful to be in a position like that</text>
  <text start="116.37" dur="5.97">to be elected to hold a position of</text>
  <text start="118.83" dur="5.37">power and have people rely on that fact</text>
  <text start="122.34" dur="3.27">and then to take those type of stances</text>
  <text start="124.2" dur="2.73">of in fighting and bickering back before</text>
  <text start="125.61" dur="2.64">and if you can&amp;#39;t do good for the world</text>
  <text start="126.93" dur="3.719">you can&amp;#39;t do go to the country</text>

  <text start="130.649" dur="4.711">and let&amp;#39;s talk about the school</text>
  <text start="133.379" dur="4.44">shootings that&amp;#39;s been a heartbreak</text>
  <text start="135.36" dur="5.459">you&amp;#39;ve had them more and more of them as</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="5.31">a reporter of what I always find missing</text>
  <text start="140.819" dur="4.471">in the coverage the coverage is all</text>
  <text start="143.129" dur="4.83">about the tragedy and then it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="145.29" dur="4.199">guns and it&amp;#39;s about everything else that</text>
  <text start="147.959" dur="3.75">has to do with that the sorrow the</text>
  <text start="149.489" dur="2.72">parents and anniversaries marking the</text>
  <text start="151.709" dur="3.59">occasion</text>
  <text start="152.209" dur="6.9">when it happened but we never get enough</text>
  <text start="155.299" dur="6.931">of why why did you do this and often</text>
  <text start="159.109" dur="5.821">they&amp;#39;re dead so we can&amp;#39;t ask them but</text>
  <text start="162.23" dur="4.319">I&amp;#39;ve got my own hunches about the why we</text>
  <text start="164.93" dur="3.869">teach our kids in school that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.549" dur="4.47">just evolutionary accidents is there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="168.799" dur="5.731">no really final meaning of their lives</text>
  <text start="171.019" dur="6.271">there&amp;#39;s no destiny for their souls this</text>
  <text start="174.53" dur="6.239">is it and if you want to grab attention</text>
  <text start="177.29" dur="6.509">why not if there is no God there is no</text>
  <text start="180.769" dur="4.741">accountability then there is no barrier</text>
  <text start="183.799" dur="6.151">from doing these things that just</text>
  <text start="185.51" dur="7.5">happens and so I I just like there was</text>
  <text start="189.95" dur="6.09">some way to just ask these young people</text>
  <text start="193.01" dur="7.429">and discern why why are you doing this</text>
  <text start="196.04" dur="8.789">and then address that rather than guns</text>
  <text start="200.439" dur="7.39">firing CS Lewis says we are raising men</text>
  <text start="204.829" dur="5.401">without chests we&amp;#39;ve taught them that</text>
  <text start="207.829" dur="4.261">there is no absolute truth that all</text>
  <text start="210.23" dur="4.2">things are relative there is no fixed</text>
  <text start="212.09" dur="4.739">morality and then when they act on those</text>
  <text start="214.43" dur="4.08">principles we seem surprised you put</text>
  <text start="216.829" dur="3.181">your child in school you want the best</text>
  <text start="218.51" dur="3.24">for them and you love them and now then</text>
  <text start="220.01" dur="3.99">they come home - ah dad or have been</text>
  <text start="221.75" dur="4.139">killed in one of these incidents my god</text>
  <text start="224" dur="3.689">everything we fought for is being</text>
  <text start="225.889" dur="3.75">undermined now that&amp;#39;s the second</text>
  <text start="227.689" dur="4.681">scenario could be if this has an agenda</text>
  <text start="229.639" dur="4.53">either one of those things is a terrible</text>
  <text start="232.37" dur="3.869">thing to think about there was a young</text>
  <text start="234.169" dur="4.171">man that we took many rounds multiple</text>
  <text start="236.239" dur="3.24">rounds keeping this shooter from harming</text>
  <text start="238.34" dur="3.81">the rest of the students and then died</text>
  <text start="239.479" dur="4.771">one of the kids told me that like a</text>
  <text start="242.15" dur="3.66">flash he jumped up she said you know</text>
  <text start="244.25" dur="3.84">he&amp;#39;s a hero he saved me</text>
  <text start="245.81" dur="3.299">he said he choked up me gran said you</text>
  <text start="248.09" dur="3.869">couldn&amp;#39;t even see how fast he was</text>
  <text start="249.109" dur="7.74">running you know out the door and after</text>
  <text start="251.959" dur="7.08">this person it&amp;#39;s attack oh no no no no</text>
  <text start="256.849" dur="5.85">you know because we were used in that</text>
  <text start="259.039" dur="4.891">way we raised him to be good till you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.699" dur="2.701">a parent you have something like this</text>
  <text start="263.93" dur="4.2">happen to you struggle with that you</text>
  <text start="265.4" dur="5.31">know I know that because of what he did</text>
  <text start="268.13" dur="5.49">others are alive and I thank God for</text>
  <text start="270.71" dur="5.25">that I love him and he&amp;#39;s a hero he</text>
  <text start="273.62" dur="5.19">always will be that was such a heartfelt</text>
  <text start="275.96" dur="5.13">thing for me to look to watch them speak</text>
  <text start="278.81" dur="4.079">about their son and how proud they were</text>
  <text start="281.09" dur="3.81">the way they raised him and</text>
  <text start="282.889" dur="5.131">he had done what he did under those</text>
  <text start="284.9" dur="4.859">conditions and as a young man taking it</text>
  <text start="288.02" dur="4.259">upon himself to give his life and love</text>
  <text start="289.759" dur="3.571">people more than himself in that moment</text>
  <text start="292.279" dur="3.39">in time nobody knows what they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="293.33" dur="5.13">do in that moment of life or death but</text>
  <text start="295.669" dur="4.411">that young man did the most heroic thing</text>
  <text start="298.46" dur="4.169">that you can do and gave his life</text>
  <text start="300.08" dur="5.549">in Chernobyl there&amp;#39;s an equal amount of</text>
  <text start="302.629" dur="5.91">terrorism in those men who fought the</text>
  <text start="305.629" dur="5.76">fires and tried to prevent an even more</text>
  <text start="308.539" dur="4.951">catastrophic explosion of that facility</text>
  <text start="311.389" dur="4.951">in Russia that could have literally</text>
  <text start="313.49" dur="5.22">poisoned half of Europe and the men who</text>
  <text start="316.34" dur="4.65">volunteered to walk into that</text>
  <text start="318.71" dur="3.66">radioactive water and drain it I mean</text>
  <text start="320.99" dur="2.97">they knew what they were doing they knew</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="3.659">the cost that they were playing they</text>
  <text start="323.96" dur="5.549">knew in two weeks they&amp;#39;d be dead no</text>
  <text start="326.029" dur="4.651">terrorism that&amp;#39;s across the board Chris</text>
  <text start="329.509" dur="4.801">you started this about</text>
  <text start="330.68" dur="5.28">we are not inherently evil my last</text>
  <text start="334.31" dur="3.629">interview before I left the East Coast</text>
  <text start="335.96" dur="4.829">for the West Coast was with Elie Wiesel</text>
  <text start="337.939" dur="5.34">a great survivor of the Holocaust who</text>
  <text start="340.789" dur="4.35">has written such heart-wrenching books</text>
  <text start="343.279" dur="5.521">about that experience whose father died</text>
  <text start="345.139" dur="5.761">there and I remember he told me from his</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="4.919">apartment looking down on Central Park</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="5.939">there in New York he said what he found</text>
  <text start="353.719" dur="4.92">in the camps was that the mistreatment</text>
  <text start="356.839" dur="5.251">of good</text>
  <text start="358.639" dur="6.601">is as deep as the mystery of people that</text>
  <text start="362.09" dur="8.23">both exist side by side if you saw most</text>
  <text start="365.24" dur="7.84">evil acts being perpetrated and the most</text>
  <text start="370.32" dur="5.22">incredible goodness in response to that</text>
  <text start="373.08" dur="5.31">in dealing with that so we are very</text>
  <text start="375.54" dur="4.89">complex beings are we not federal prison</text>
  <text start="378.39" dur="5.01">and maximum security I&amp;#39;ve seen the best</text>
  <text start="380.43" dur="4.47">and worst of people these things come</text>
  <text start="383.4" dur="5.19">out and you get to know who people</text>
  <text start="384.9" dur="5.88">really are in those moments and it</text>
  <text start="388.59" dur="4.2">really is i opening the majority of us</text>
  <text start="390.78" dur="4.8">just want to live a life raise our</text>
  <text start="392.79" dur="3.81">children be decent human beings treat</text>
  <text start="395.58" dur="3.93">people as we would want to be treated</text>
  <text start="396.6" dur="5.13">and we believe inter demand process by</text>
  <text start="399.51" dur="4.14">very psychotic evil individuals that</text>
  <text start="401.73" dur="4.41">have gained criminals that have gained</text>
  <text start="403.65" dur="4.8">power and we&amp;#39;ve allowed these people to</text>
  <text start="406.14" dur="4.11">raise to these levels and then to</text>
  <text start="408.45" dur="3.33">operate these levels and under secrecy</text>
  <text start="410.25" dur="6">that&amp;#39;s really the undermining of our</text>
  <text start="411.78" dur="8.7">world I think it was Lincoln who said it</text>
  <text start="416.25" dur="7.29">is impossible to enslave a Bible reading</text>
  <text start="420.48" dur="6.15">people because in the scriptures we</text>
  <text start="423.54" dur="8.13">learn who we really are are our dignity</text>
  <text start="426.63" dur="7.59">and our souls and and now the Bible is</text>
  <text start="431.67" dur="6.6">to speak the grace of our culture</text>
  <text start="434.22" dur="8.54">ignored and so if we if we take away the</text>
  <text start="438.27" dur="4.49">foundation the building collapses on top</text>
