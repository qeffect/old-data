  <text start="473.73" dur="6.99">crackdown on that so that is very good</text>
  <text start="476.96" dur="7.51">okay so now also we have to think about</text>
  <text start="480.72" dur="5.28">the Mexican border so for quite some</text>
  <text start="484.47" dur="4.29">time now we have said over and over</text>
  <text start="486" dur="6">again and including president Trump has</text>
  <text start="488.76" dur="7.5">also addressed this he said that when it</text>
  <text start="492" dur="7.11">comes to the border crisis yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.26" dur="7.409">concerned with illegal immigration but</text>
  <text start="499.11" dur="8.76">there&amp;#39;s also this aspect of trafficking</text>

  <text start="509.52" dur="4.47">trafficking and also human trafficking</text>
  <text start="511.38" dur="6.9">this occurs over a porous border and</text>
  <text start="513.99" dur="6.66">that&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s a fight to seal this</text>
  <text start="518.28" dur="6.45">because we have to put a stop to it now</text>
  <text start="520.65" dur="7.98">most mainstream media outlets have said</text>
  <text start="524.73" dur="6.45">that there is no grounds for a president</text>
  <text start="528.63" dur="4.54">Trump to be claiming that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="531.18" dur="4.149">problem with human trafficking across</text>
  <text start="533.17" dur="4.409">the border and all that but now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.329" dur="4.081">seeing Fox News is actually going to</text>
  <text start="537.579" dur="4.491">address this and they&amp;#39;re actually going</text>
  <text start="539.41" dur="6.03">to talk about it which is a good thing</text>
  <text start="542.07" dur="6.959">this needs to be something that&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="545.44" dur="7.92">out there where you know people realize</text>
  <text start="549.029" dur="7.211">that this is a real occurrence okay this</text>
  <text start="553.36" dur="4.349">is not some fringe idea this is</text>
  <text start="556.24" dur="4.8">happening all the time it has been</text>
  <text start="557.709" dur="6.361">happening for a long time so this one is</text>
  <text start="561.04" dur="4.919">from Fox News says children being bought</text>

  <text start="581.529" dur="5.461">find the public fight over u.s.</text>
  <text start="582.94" dur="6.57">immigration policy for months yeah so as</text>
  <text start="586.99" dur="4.02">soon as I read this immediately that</text>
  <text start="589.51" dur="4.11">picture of that child came in my mind</text>
  <text start="591.01" dur="7.67">because they had that picture of that</text>
  <text start="593.62" dur="8.64">little girl plastered over every single</text>
  <text start="598.68" dur="6.909">magazine cover across you know the front</text>
  <text start="602.26" dur="4.92">page of every newspaper so we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="605.589" dur="3.961">familiar with this photo and they even</text>
  <text start="607.18" dur="4.589">made memes with this photo you know</text>
  <text start="609.55" dur="3.21">where I remember the one where they had</text>
  <text start="611.769" dur="3.331">this little girl</text>
  <text start="612.76" dur="4.17">pictured in front of President Trump and</text>
  <text start="615.1" dur="5.609">she was looking up towards a president</text>
  <text start="616.93" dur="8.13">Trump so you know this has been used as</text>
  <text start="620.709" dur="6.841">their argument for an open border like</text>
  <text start="625.06" dur="5.37">oh we have to you know let these people</text>
  <text start="627.55" dur="4.529">over here and look they&amp;#39;re just coming</text>
  <text start="630.43" dur="3.029">here for a better life and we need to</text>
  <text start="632.079" dur="6">treat the better and we can&amp;#39;t separate</text>
  <text start="633.459" dur="6.961">them and all this so but really the real</text>
  <text start="638.079" dur="4.44">issue here is that there are people</text>
  <text start="640.42" dur="4.349">being trafficked and a lot of these</text>
  <text start="642.519" dur="5.281">children that are being separated by</text>
  <text start="644.769" dur="7.231">their quote parents these people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="647.8" dur="7.56">their parents these people are using</text>
  <text start="652" dur="5.43">them to get across the border or they</text>
  <text start="655.36" dur="5.25">are bringing them here to traffic that</text>
  <text start="657.43" dur="6.089">for that purpose right so a lot of times</text>
  <text start="660.61" dur="5.58">these children who are being separated</text>
  <text start="663.519" dur="3.601">those are not their parents and so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="666.19" dur="4.769">actually better</text>
  <text start="667.12" dur="5.219">to separate so the gut-wrenching stories</text>

  <text start="1353.509" dur="7.681">this author she&amp;#39;s saying that you know</text>
  <text start="1357.429" dur="8.71">things that are immoral like for example</text>
  <text start="1361.19" dur="8.459">killing babies especially full term</text>
  <text start="1366.139" dur="6.301">abortions right or even after a baby is</text>
  <text start="1369.649" dur="5.01">born they&amp;#39;re arguing whether or not this</text>
  <text start="1372.44" dur="4.639">baby can be killed if a mother just you</text>
  <text start="1374.659" dur="8.67">know doesn&amp;#39;t want the child or whatever</text>
  <text start="1377.079" dur="8.98">so a way to you know make it sound</text>
  <text start="1383.329" dur="8.25">better to where it&amp;#39;s easier to swallow</text>
  <text start="1386.059" dur="8.04">for you know the the public is to wrap</text>
  <text start="1391.579" dur="7.47">it up in packaging called human rights</text>
  <text start="1394.099" dur="6.57">so oh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the right of a woman to</text>
  <text start="1399.049" dur="4.5">decide what she wants to do with her</text>
  <text start="1400.669" dur="4.56">body it&amp;#39;s the right of a woman to decide</text>
  <text start="1403.549" dur="6.18">whether or not she wants to have a baby</text>
  <text start="1405.229" dur="7.8">so also likewise we have this you know</text>
  <text start="1409.729" dur="9.03">sexual identity it&amp;#39;s someone&amp;#39;s right to</text>
  <text start="1413.029" dur="8.34">have you know their own sexual</text>
  <text start="1418.759" dur="5.88">preference and it&amp;#39;s their right not to</text>
  <text start="1421.369" dur="7.1">be discriminated against so there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="1424.639" dur="6.75">push where you know these profiles are</text>
  <text start="1428.469" dur="6.04">trying to break into the LGBTQ community</text>
  <text start="1431.389" dur="6.02">and gain that sexual orientation</text>
  <text start="1434.509" dur="5.67">identity because then they can be</text>
  <text start="1437.409" dur="7.17">protected because it&amp;#39;s a civil rights</text>
  <text start="1440.179" dur="7.41">issue it&amp;#39;s a human rights issue right so</text>
  <text start="1444.579" dur="8.01">that&amp;#39;s what this is about and they are</text>
  <text start="1447.589" dur="7.77">trying to push towards that and also I</text>
  <text start="1452.589" dur="5.231">think I mentioned this a little while</text>
  <text start="1455.359" dur="4.561">ago and I know it&amp;#39;s been in the news and</text>
  <text start="1457.82" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s been talked about by a few others</text>
  <text start="1459.92" dur="7.68">but in California they are including</text>
  <text start="1463.97" dur="7.05">pedophilia as a sexual orientation in</text>
  <text start="1467.6" dur="8.46">sexual health education that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1471.02" dur="7.41">teaching to school children so again</text>
  <text start="1476.06" dur="5.79">this should be something that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1478.43" dur="6.44">considered far-fetched you know where oh</text>
  <text start="1481.85" dur="5.16">you know we shouldn&amp;#39;t be afraid of</text>
  <text start="1484.87" dur="4.54">pedophilia being normalized that will</text>
  <text start="1487.01" dur="6.86">never happen because it&amp;#39;s happening I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1489.41" dur="6.75">sure you know 20 years ago people</text>
  <text start="1493.87" dur="7.57">wouldn&amp;#39;t have thought at that time that</text>
  <text start="1496.16" dur="10.17">you know it would be acceptable to have</text>
  <text start="1501.44" dur="7.65">children change their genders you know</text>
  <text start="1506.33" dur="7.76">now that is so normal that in some</text>
  <text start="1509.09" dur="9.12">states they&amp;#39;re not even required to give</text>
  <text start="1514.09" dur="7.21">their baby a gender listed on their</text>
  <text start="1518.21" dur="6.03">birth certificate when they&amp;#39;re born they</text>
  <text start="1521.3" dur="5.07">just leave it open because they want</text>
  <text start="1524.24" dur="6.21">their child to have the opportunity to</text>
  <text start="1526.37" dur="6.27">choose that is something that no one</text>
  <text start="1530.45" dur="4.92">probably would have thought about 20</text>
  <text start="1532.64" dur="5.64">years ago but this is how things change</text>
  <text start="1535.37" dur="4.94">this is how things happen where you know</text>
  <text start="1538.28" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s just a little bit it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="1540.31" dur="6.25">little thing here in there where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1543.29" dur="7.17">slowly changing it&amp;#39;s slowly being pushed</text>
  <text start="1546.56" dur="6.36">towards being normal being accepted it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1550.46" dur="4.8">not going to be this huge overnight</text>
  <text start="1552.92" dur="4.26">thing where one day pedophilia is</text>
  <text start="1555.26" dur="4.98">abhorrent and then the next day it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1557.18" dur="8.01">celebrated that&amp;#39;s not how it happens</text>
  <text start="1560.24" dur="7.07">okay it happens so incrementally that we</text>
  <text start="1565.19" dur="7.26">don&amp;#39;t even realize what is happening</text>
  <text start="1567.31" dur="6.91">until one day it&amp;#39;s just normal and we</text>
  <text start="1572.45" dur="3.6">wonder how we got there well this is how</text>
  <text start="1574.22" dur="5.49">we get there you know we get there</text>
  <text start="1576.05" dur="7.56">through these things like hash tag love</text>
  <text start="1579.71" dur="7.95">hip has no age and by you know things</text>
  <text start="1583.61" dur="5.58">like pedophilia being labeled a sexual</text>
  <text start="1587.66" dur="3.78">orientation</text>
  <text start="1589.19" dur="4.29">public education this is how these</text>
  <text start="1591.44" dur="4.89">things happen little by little so we</text>
  <text start="1593.48" dur="4.65">need to be aware of this and really</text>
  <text start="1596.33" dur="4.89">start to push back they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="1598.13" dur="4.92">towards it and we need to push back okay</text>
  <text start="1601.22" dur="4.62">so the next thing I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="1603.05" dur="5.46">really quickly here I did find this</text>
  <text start="1605.84" dur="4.65">little gem here this is really</text>
  <text start="1608.51" dur="4.76">interesting and I&amp;#39;m going to be</text>
  <text start="1610.49" dur="6.21">following up on this very closely</text>
  <text start="1613.27" dur="6.76">because I think there&amp;#39;s more to it</text>
  <text start="1616.7" dur="6.75">really than what is being said here on</text>
  <text start="1620.03" dur="6.45">their surface in this article all right</text>

  <text start="1730.81" dur="4.8">that I include here I&amp;#39;m definitely going</text>
  <text start="1733.63" dur="3.36">to also include this in the description</text>
  <text start="1735.61" dur="5.28">below and you should take the time to</text>
  <text start="1736.99" dur="6.78">read it because there&amp;#39;s a lot of really</text>
  <text start="1740.89" dur="5.28">interesting points of information in</text>
  <text start="1743.77" dur="5.04">this article but basically I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="1746.17" dur="7.32">give an overview of this where this</text>
  <text start="1748.81" dur="7.74">sheriff is being held accountable for</text>
  <text start="1753.49" dur="6.62">this shooting now what&amp;#39;s unusual about</text>
  <text start="1756.55" dur="6.15">this is because you know typically you</text>
  <text start="1760.11" dur="5.41">wouldn&amp;#39;t see criminal charges like this</text>
  <text start="1762.7" dur="5.97">being held against an officer who is</text>
  <text start="1765.52" dur="5.85">just trying to do his job right because</text>
  <text start="1768.67" dur="4.65">sometimes you&amp;#39;re gonna make mistakes and</text>
  <text start="1771.37" dur="4.74">that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily lead to</text>
  <text start="1773.32" dur="5.76">criminal charges maybe perhaps you might</text>
  <text start="1776.11" dur="5.22">be suspended or taken off field and put</text>
  <text start="1779.08" dur="4.53">behind a desk or whatever the case may</text>
  <text start="1781.33" dur="4.95">be but there are criminal charges here</text>
  <text start="1783.61" dur="7.41">and the thing that we have to realize is</text>
  <text start="1786.28" dur="8.73">that also Scott Israel was also fired</text>
  <text start="1791.02" dur="7.67">over this whole ordeal and this shooting</text>
  <text start="1795.01" dur="8.22">this particular one here in Florida was</text>
  <text start="1798.69" dur="8.2">very similar to Las Vegas and the fact</text>
  <text start="1803.23" dur="6.78">that it was Barry there was very</text>
  <text start="1806.89" dur="7.74">obviously something suspicious going on</text>
  <text start="1810.01" dur="9.12">with this whole thing okay now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1814.63" dur="7.23">want to say but I want to say right now</text>
  <text start="1819.13" dur="6.15">because I don&amp;#39;t want to get this video</text>
  <text start="1821.86" dur="8.73">flagged but you know what I&amp;#39;m saying I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1825.28" dur="9.69">saying that this shooting was not what</text>
  <text start="1830.59" dur="6.57">it was supposed to appear like it was it</text>
  <text start="1834.97" dur="3.54">was supposed to appear to be some kid</text>
  <text start="1837.16" dur="4.2">just went off the rails</text>
  <text start="1838.51" dur="4.74">and came in with a gun and shot everyone</text>
  <text start="1841.36" dur="3.84">and that&amp;#39;s why we need to push for gun</text>
  <text start="1843.25" dur="4.14">laws okay same thing with the Las Vegas</text>
  <text start="1845.2" dur="6.24">shooting Las Vegas shooting was the same</text>
  <text start="1847.39" dur="7.38">thing however that&amp;#39;s not really what it</text>
  <text start="1851.44" dur="10.109">was it was more of an organized</text>
  <text start="1854.77" dur="11.34">you bent intended to push for gun</text>
  <text start="1861.549" dur="6.62">legislation that&amp;#39;s what this was there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1866.11" dur="5.85">a name for it I&amp;#39;m not gonna say it but</text>
  <text start="1868.169" dur="6.431">but you know what I mean so and it was</text>
  <text start="1871.96" dur="5.28">botched it was completely botched and it</text>
  <text start="1874.6" dur="5.64">was botched because everything about it</text>
  <text start="1877.24" dur="8.28">was obvious there were holes in the</text>
  <text start="1880.24" dur="8.789">story from the very first moment that it</text>
  <text start="1885.52" dur="6.99">broke okay so they spent a lot of time</text>
  <text start="1889.029" dur="8.161">trying to organize their story because</text>
  <text start="1892.51" dur="8.82">nothing lined up now this particular</text>
  <text start="1897.19" dur="6.06">officer is not the only one who is being</text>
  <text start="1901.33" dur="5.25">incriminating right now there are others</text>
  <text start="1903.25" dur="5.58">right so and in this article you&amp;#39;ll find</text>
  <text start="1906.58" dur="4.979">that of course they were saying that you</text>
  <text start="1908.83" dur="6.36">know there were officers who were just</text>
  <text start="1911.559" dur="4.98">sitting outside they weren&amp;#39;t moving into</text>
  <text start="1915.19" dur="4.53">the building where they were supposed to</text>
  <text start="1916.539" dur="8.52">be in all this and this is because they</text>
  <text start="1919.72" dur="7.98">weren&amp;#39;t supposed to be they were not</text>
  <text start="1925.059" dur="7.051">supposed to go in they were supposed to</text>
  <text start="1927.7" dur="7.829">allow it to happen because the whole</text>
  <text start="1932.11" dur="5.46">point of this was to push for gun laws</text>
  <text start="1935.529" dur="6.361">that&amp;#39;s what this was about</text>
  <text start="1937.57" dur="10.05">and so anytime something like this</text>
  <text start="1941.89" dur="10.32">happens this is criminal because people</text>
  <text start="1947.62" dur="7.049">died in this you cannot harm others and</text>
  <text start="1952.21" dur="3.87">expect to get away with it so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1954.669" dur="3.63">what this was and you know I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="1956.08" dur="7.199">this before where these people and power</text>
  <text start="1958.299" dur="7.711">they are so corrupt and so void of any</text>
  <text start="1963.279" dur="6.87">kind of soul or morality that they are</text>
  <text start="1966.01" dur="5.22">willing to harm people in order to get</text>
  <text start="1970.149" dur="3.091">what they want</text>
  <text start="1971.23" dur="5.16">right so in order to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="1973.24" dur="5.4">in order to accomplish their goals they</text>
  <text start="1976.39" dur="4.529">will run over whoever they need to in</text>
  <text start="1978.64" dur="4.98">order to do it and so this is one of</text>
  <text start="1980.919" dur="6">those times when that happened and</text>
  <text start="1983.62" dur="7.62">these people need to be held accountable</text>
  <text start="1986.919" dur="6.481">and so now we are seeing a major turn of</text>
  <text start="1991.24" dur="5.819">events right the tables are turning</text>
  <text start="1993.4" dur="6.72">right now because now finally for this</text>
  <text start="1997.059" dur="5.701">type of event these people are going to</text>
  <text start="2000.12" dur="5.46">be held accountable and I&amp;#39;m sure that</text>
  <text start="2002.76" dur="5.159">this guy who is facing a lot of time in</text>
  <text start="2005.58" dur="4.5">prison he&amp;#39;s not going to be the only one</text>
  <text start="2007.919" dur="6.721">and I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;re going to also see</text>
  <text start="2010.08" dur="6.54">Scott Israel behind bars as well so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2014.64" dur="4.019">going to be following this very closely</text>
  <text start="2016.62" dur="6.23">because I think this is very important</text>
  <text start="2018.659" dur="7.981">because there has been so many other</text>
  <text start="2022.85" dur="5.439">events like this where the people who</text>
  <text start="2026.64" dur="5.94">should have been held accountable just</text>
  <text start="2028.289" dur="6.87">were not they weren&amp;#39;t and so this is a</text>
  <text start="2032.58" dur="5.24">big deal so anyway that&amp;#39;s all I have for</text>
