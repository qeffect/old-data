  <text start="1.159" dur="5.95">welcome back my friends this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="3.78" dur="5.34">demos of Apex health club and I want to</text>
  <text start="7.109" dur="3.691">talk a little bit about the c60 market</text>
  <text start="9.12" dur="3.689">I&amp;#39;ve come to you guys before and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="10.8" dur="4.289">I&amp;#39;ve talked about some of these scams</text>
  <text start="12.809" dur="3.691">they&amp;#39;re going on out there and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="15.089" dur="3.69">talked about some of the products people</text>
  <text start="16.5" dur="4.05">are marketing in weird ways like super</text>
  <text start="18.779" dur="5.221">fullerenes whatever that&amp;#39;s meant to be</text>
  <text start="20.55" dur="4.68">for three times the price just people</text>
  <text start="24" dur="3.93">are taking advantage of people out there</text>
  <text start="25.23" dur="4.86">and in some cases people may simply be</text>
  <text start="27.93" dur="4.739">ignorant of the facts of the case</text>
  <text start="30.09" dur="4.469">because there is a strain of people</text>
  <text start="32.669" dur="3.211">within the c60 community that believe</text>
  <text start="34.559" dur="3.481">that you can actually get fullerenes</text>
  <text start="35.88" dur="2.609">naturally-occurring from something like</text>
  <text start="38.04" dur="3.089">jean-guy</text>
  <text start="38.489" dur="4.89">i used to think that but I can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="41.129" dur="5.041">any research to support it for something</text>
  <text start="43.379" dur="5.041">like wood ash or soot just burnt wood</text>
  <text start="46.17" dur="4.409">and I can&amp;#39;t find any evidence to support</text>
  <text start="48.42" dur="3.9">that that could be useful in other ways</text>
  <text start="50.579" dur="4.651">you know activated charcoal that kind of</text>
  <text start="52.32" dur="5.899">thing but I want to give you guys</text>
  <text start="55.23" dur="8.19">actually a really good visual example</text>
  <text start="58.219" dur="7.571">this is activated charcoal this I got on</text>
  <text start="63.42" dur="6.21">Amazon and I think it was like 50 bucks</text>
  <text start="65.79" dur="5.97">or less puppies kittens stop it</text>
  <text start="69.63" dur="4.59">whatever&amp;#39;s going on so you can imagine</text>
  <text start="71.76" dur="9.48">this is a three hundred and forty gram</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="8.88">12 ounce tub where whereas this is let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="6.48">see how much is this I don&amp;#39;t think it</text>
  <text start="83.1" dur="7.309">has a that&amp;#39;s a this line is a hundred</text>
  <text start="87.72" dur="6.84">grams right here and this was almost</text>
  <text start="90.409" dur="7.78">$19,000 so I want you to compare what</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="6.12">you&amp;#39;re getting when you buy activated</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="4.11">charcoal versus c60 all right and this</text>
  <text start="100.68" dur="3.63">is the powdered form you don&amp;#39;t eat the</text>
  <text start="102.299" dur="7.021">powder like you do with this you</text>
  <text start="104.31" dur="10.23">actually take 1.8 gram per 1 litre of</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="7.2">oil and then you take the oil I have one</text>
  <text start="114.54" dur="4.079">on my desk because I always have one I</text>
  <text start="116.52" dur="5.099">take it every day you take the oil in</text>
  <text start="118.619" dur="6.121">this form and real c60 of course will</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="4.89">turn something like a coconut to a pink</text>
  <text start="124.74" dur="3.379">or purple it&amp;#39;s kind of an ugly color</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="4.47">right now because if the temperature</text>
  <text start="128.119" dur="4.331">generally is sort of a brilliant pink if</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="2.921">you guys look at the shopping cart on my</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="3.88">website you&amp;#39;ll see that</text>
  <text start="133.9" dur="4.32">one of the model pictures I took was one</text>
  <text start="136.33" dur="3.51">of these bottles with the lid off and</text>
  <text start="138.22" dur="3.57">you can see the inside is in the</text>
  <text start="139.84" dur="4.259">sunlight and it&amp;#39;s in brilliant hot pink</text>
  <text start="141.79" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s kind of a weird thing kids will</text>
  <text start="144.099" dur="3.571">probably think it&amp;#39;s weird I want to play</text>
  <text start="146.17" dur="3.51">with it but anyway you&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="147.67" dur="5.25">difference this is the concentrated form</text>
  <text start="149.68" dur="5.49">you don&amp;#39;t consume for 19 grand this is</text>
  <text start="152.92" dur="4.77">the bulk charcoal form that you would</text>
  <text start="155.17" dur="4.679">get for general detoxification purposes</text>
  <text start="157.69" dur="3.72">or it&amp;#39;s useful it&amp;#39;s one of those things</text>
  <text start="159.849" dur="3.441">that you would take if you just take you</text>
  <text start="161.41" dur="4.38">know took poison you take spoons of that</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="4.81">to try to soak up the poison from your</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="3.24">stomach it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s one of those things</text>
  <text start="168.1" dur="2.43">that everyone should have in their</text>
  <text start="169.03" dur="4.95">probably have in their household</text>
  <text start="170.53" dur="5.37">emergency kit first aid and it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="173.98" dur="4.71">go-to thing for most poisons by the way</text>
  <text start="175.9" dur="6.48">now the point that I&amp;#39;m making with all</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="5.64">of this is of is not to just bash</text>
  <text start="182.38" dur="4.109">activated charcoal it&amp;#39;s the fact that</text>
  <text start="184.33" dur="4.17">people are making a lot of money on this</text>
  <text start="186.489" dur="3.931">I was just looking at some different</text>
  <text start="188.5" dur="3.18">things online and I&amp;#39;ve noticed this</text>
  <text start="190.42" dur="2.73">before and I didn&amp;#39;t say anything about</text>
  <text start="191.68" dur="3.63">it at the time because you know he may</text>
  <text start="193.15" dur="4.199">believe they have c60 in it but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.31" dur="3.149">a really famous guy out there who I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="197.349" dur="3.271">always thought was pretty cool I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="198.459" dur="4.681">bashing him in any way but David avocado</text>
  <text start="200.62" dur="5.42">Wolfe okay this guy is a very famous in</text>
  <text start="203.14" dur="6.27">sort of the the holistic health or</text>
  <text start="206.04" dur="5.8">nutrition field right always making</text>
  <text start="209.41" dur="4.409">videos about I mean organic food</text>
  <text start="211.84" dur="6.869">appearing in documentaries that kind of</text>
  <text start="213.819" dur="7.441">thing and he is selling c60 but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.709" dur="7.261">selling c60 in the form of a super</text>
  <text start="221.26" dur="7.379">charcoal and here the aware show calm I</text>
  <text start="225.97" dur="4.62">think that&amp;#39;s his website and it says the</text>
  <text start="228.639" dur="4.771">aware show calm slash wolf so it&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="230.59" dur="3.959">to be his website or at least he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.41" dur="3.18">featuring on and they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="234.549" dur="4.651">his product here and I wanted to scroll</text>
  <text start="236.59" dur="6.45">down so you guys can see this with me so</text>
  <text start="239.2" dur="6.06">what makes C 60 charcoal so special he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.04" dur="6.029">this is their website here so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="6.09">describing it C 60 charcoal is different</text>
  <text start="249.069" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s made from sustainably sourced</text>
  <text start="251.35" dur="5.639">hardwoods and is fat soluble which makes</text>
  <text start="254.829" dur="3.66">it highly absorbent in the body the</text>
  <text start="256.989" dur="3.271">poorest surface of the charcoal has a</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="4.711">negative electric charge that attracts</text>
  <text start="260.26" dur="5.219">positive positively charged toxins and</text>
  <text start="263.2" dur="3.64">poisons in your body the charcoal binds</text>
  <text start="265.479" dur="3.131">with toxins and</text>
  <text start="266.84" dur="4.829">dates them from the body through the</text>
  <text start="268.61" dur="4.71">intestines okay so he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="271.669" dur="3.111">charcoal let&amp;#39;s talk about a few</text>
  <text start="273.32" dur="4.11">differences here real fast because</text>
  <text start="274.78" dur="4.72">you&amp;#39;re not getting the same results now</text>
  <text start="277.43" dur="4.769">they are going to be kinda similar in</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="4.41">terms of what they do to toxins within</text>
  <text start="282.199" dur="5.731">your intestinal tract okay</text>
  <text start="283.91" dur="6.12">the difference is that c60 is actually</text>
  <text start="287.93" dur="3.81">so tiny you can&amp;#39;t even see it like one</text>
  <text start="290.03" dur="5.639">molecule of this like you I think you</text>
  <text start="291.74" dur="7.32">can fit around almost 300,000 molecules</text>
  <text start="295.669" dur="6.841">of single individual c60 in a row across</text>
  <text start="299.06" dur="4.89">the grain of ass and so it&amp;#39;s very tiny</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="3">and it&amp;#39;s actually tiny enough to slip</text>
  <text start="303.95" dur="3.21">out of their digestive tract and into</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="3.45">the rest of your body actually can go</text>
  <text start="307.16" dur="3.78">even into your brain and then you get</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="3.78">some of those those regenerative</text>
  <text start="310.94" dur="5.85">benefits even in your brain right some</text>
  <text start="312.74" dur="6.09">of those antioxidants which are linked</text>
  <text start="316.79" dur="6.27">to the longevity effects that people</text>
  <text start="318.83" dur="5.94">keep talking about with c60 so what</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="4.26">happens if you take his product nothing</text>
  <text start="324.77" dur="3.869">bad if it&amp;#39;s if it&amp;#39;s actually activated</text>
  <text start="327.32" dur="3.719">charcoal and I have no reason to doubt</text>
  <text start="328.639" dur="4.381">it because it&amp;#39;s quite cheap and it will</text>
  <text start="331.039" dur="4.531">turn everything that you put it in black</text>
  <text start="333.02" dur="5.88">by the way and black is not real c60 no</text>
  <text start="335.57" dur="5.3">matter what they tell you there are a</text>
  <text start="338.9" dur="4.11">lot of people just under this</text>
  <text start="340.87" dur="3.669">misconception and they&amp;#39;re giving out</text>
  <text start="343.01" dur="3.36">free information you know like that kind</text>
  <text start="344.539" dur="3.121">of thing about this not even just trying</text>
  <text start="346.37" dur="3.45">to sell the product but in some cases</text>
  <text start="347.66" dur="4.08">just sharing information they genuinely</text>
  <text start="349.82" dur="2.909">think will help people but not the real</text>
  <text start="351.74" dur="3.33">deal</text>
  <text start="352.729" dur="4.741">so the real deal it&amp;#39;s very hard to get I</text>
  <text start="355.07" dur="4.8">finally was able to get this because I</text>
  <text start="357.47" dur="4.47">had to save up and borrow and spend so</text>
  <text start="359.87" dur="3.63">much to get such a large minimum and</text>
  <text start="361.94" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s only a few people in the world</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="5.31">that make it and finally i&amp;#39;m restocked</text>
  <text start="367.31" dur="3">more people are beginning to make it the</text>
  <text start="368.81" dur="3.78">right way but you don&amp;#39;t make it my</text>
  <text start="370.31" dur="5.55">burning wood you make it by bouncing</text>
  <text start="372.59" dur="6.18">electric bolts or lightening between two</text>
  <text start="375.86" dur="5.1">graphite rods in a sealed gas chamber</text>
  <text start="378.77" dur="3.75">it gets hot as hot as the Sun and it</text>
  <text start="380.96" dur="3.15">just go hotter and it continues to</text>
  <text start="382.52" dur="6.54">bounce around and flake off little</text>
  <text start="384.11" dur="6.66">pieces of of graphite which as they</text>
  <text start="389.06" dur="4.47">break down into tiny tiny tiny tiny</text>
  <text start="390.77" dur="6.12">pieces that become c60 or other forms of</text>
  <text start="393.53" dur="6.22">carbons like c70 or or lower carbons or</text>
  <text start="396.89" dur="4.48">even higher forms of like there&amp;#39;s a c4</text>
  <text start="399.75" dur="3.51">50 or something like that right and I</text>
  <text start="401.37" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t even I don&amp;#39;t think anyone&amp;#39;s ever</text>
  <text start="403.26" dur="3.06">used it I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s been tested</text>
  <text start="404.67" dur="3.69">or anything like that it&amp;#39;s so hard to</text>
  <text start="406.32" dur="4.35">refine because you have to keep reducing</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="4.83">what you have and you get diminishing</text>
  <text start="410.67" dur="6.06">returns and you get like a tiny bit for</text>
  <text start="413.19" dur="6.33">for a 99.99% purity where you would have</text>
  <text start="416.73" dur="7.32">gotten maybe a handful for a 99.95 so it</text>
  <text start="419.52" dur="7.1">gets increasingly more time diminishing</text>
  <text start="424.05" dur="5.28">returns as you try to refine the purity</text>
  <text start="426.62" dur="4.72">so and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s things that you</text>
  <text start="429.33" dur="3.6">can go into on this topic like c70 is a</text>
  <text start="431.34" dur="3.36">completely different effect it has a</text>
  <text start="432.93" dur="5.55">stronger effect and it has a more</text>
  <text start="434.7" dur="5.88">energetic effect or I think people I</text>
  <text start="438.48" dur="4.53">think people suggest taking that one</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="3.96">like when you&amp;#39;re meditating or or just</text>
  <text start="443.01" dur="3.45">need an energy boost or something I</text>
  <text start="444.54" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t know but I I&amp;#39;m not as familiar</text>
  <text start="446.46" dur="3.92">with c70 and but it does have some very</text>
  <text start="448.89" dur="4.14">interesting and potentially promising</text>
  <text start="450.38" dur="3.76">things I had stronger than c60 so I</text>
  <text start="453.03" dur="3.63">can&amp;#39;t wait till they can eventually</text>
  <text start="454.14" dur="4.77">experiment with the higher forms but I</text>
  <text start="456.66" dur="4.83">just want people to be aware of this I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="458.91" dur="4.38">not going after him in particular he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="461.49" dur="4.41">just a good example because he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.29" dur="3.99">well known and his product sells out I</text>
  <text start="465.9" dur="4.579">mean I just looked at his shopping cart</text>
  <text start="467.28" dur="6.33">some of his stuff is sold out and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.479" dur="4.451">let&amp;#39;s face it as popular as c60 is a lot</text>
  <text start="473.61" dur="3.6">of people are making a lot of money</text>
  <text start="474.93" dur="8.34">right now by selling fake stuff at full</text>
  <text start="477.21" dur="8.85">price you know the real deal you know it</text>
  <text start="483.27" dur="6.709">has a lot of material cost goes into it</text>
  <text start="486.06" dur="6.99">now where is his shopping darkman I</text>
  <text start="489.979" dur="7.631">don&amp;#39;t know maybe he&amp;#39;s on her show I</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="7.5">don&amp;#39;t know but I just saw it on his</text>
  <text start="497.61" dur="6.45">shopping cart let&amp;#39;s go check it out here</text>
  <text start="500.55" dur="7.05">shop David Wolfe Co apologies okay so</text>
  <text start="504.06" dur="4.89">this is one of his and he had a few</text>
  <text start="507.6" dur="3.06">others that were sold out like I think</text>
  <text start="508.95" dur="6.36">he was the payer version of the two</text>
  <text start="510.66" dur="8.069">different oils for a hundred bucks yeah</text>
  <text start="515.31" dur="4.95">it was the paired version so you guys</text>
  <text start="518.729" dur="4.171">can kind of see what I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="520.26" dur="4.5">like I just don&amp;#39;t want people to go into</text>
  <text start="522.9" dur="3.81">this and maybe you&amp;#39;ll get some placebo</text>
  <text start="524.76" dur="3">effect but you won&amp;#39;t get c60 effect and</text>
  <text start="526.71" dur="3.39">I don&amp;#39;t want people to waste their money</text>
  <text start="527.76" dur="4.17">getting the wrong thing I heard I</text>
  <text start="530.1" dur="2.64">encourage the use of activated charcoal</text>
  <text start="531.93" dur="2.94">I just</text>
  <text start="532.74" dur="3.36">want you to think it&amp;#39;s e60 I hope this</text>
  <text start="534.87" dur="4.86">video has helped please let me know II</text>
  <text start="536.1" dur="6.39">think in the comments yes I do sell c60</text>
  <text start="539.73" dur="4.95">myself at Apex health dock club so you</text>
  <text start="542.49" dur="3.69">know full disclosure there you know</text>
  <text start="544.68" dur="2.7">technically I&amp;#39;m a competitor here so I</text>
  <text start="546.18" dur="3.06">could just be bad-mouthing the</text>
  <text start="547.38" dur="3.209">competition but I think I&amp;#39;ve made my</text>
  <text start="549.24" dur="3.3">case and I think I&amp;#39;ve made it in a</text>
  <text start="550.589" dur="3">strong way so you guys can sort of just</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="3.39">make up your own decision at that point</text>
  <text start="553.589" dur="4.381">and do some more research either way I</text>
  <text start="555.93" dur="3.36">think this is it for now and I hope you</text>
  <text start="557.97" dur="2.55">guys will stay tuned and maybe consider</text>
  <text start="559.29" dur="3.27">subscribing to the channel</text>
