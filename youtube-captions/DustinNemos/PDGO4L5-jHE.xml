  <text start="181.44" dur="2.48">today&amp;#39;s America</text>
  <text start="184.47" dur="4.62">there was a time when I had my head in</text>
  <text start="186.63" dur="5.28">the sand then I found out that power</text>
  <text start="189.09" dur="5.73">platers past lies for truth and truth</text>
  <text start="191.91" dur="5.55">for lies especially in areas of life and</text>

  <text start="214.23" dur="9.9">pill living calm wake up stand up speak</text>
  <text start="218.55" dur="9.69">up so Israel itself may be drawn into a</text>
  <text start="224.13" dur="6.33">violent conflict more violent conflict I</text>
  <text start="228.24" dur="4.53">should say with the local jihadi</text>
  <text start="230.46" dur="4.62">fundamentalist types that are basically</text>
  <text start="232.77" dur="3.86">raining down rockets on Israel even Tel</text>
  <text start="235.08" dur="4.17">Aviv at this point</text>
  <text start="236.63" dur="6.31">non-stop more recently of course this</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="5.88">this we are going to war quote it was in</text>
  <text start="242.94" dur="5.91">response to one of their leaders being</text>
  <text start="245.13" dur="5.76">taken out so on Tuesday terrorists in</text>
  <text start="248.85" dur="4.109">the Gaza Strip fired hundreds of rockets</text>
  <text start="250.89" dur="4.05">at Israel in retaliation for Israel&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.959" dur="4.381">targeted killing of the senior commander</text>
  <text start="254.94" dur="5.19">of Islamic Jihad in Gaza</text>
  <text start="257.34" dur="5.25">so they got him they were able to stop</text>
  <text start="260.13" dur="4.32">about a third of maybe a fourth of the</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="5.04">Rockets that were sent back into Israel</text>
  <text start="264.45" dur="5.28">in retaliation so that Iron Dome defense</text>
  <text start="267.63" dur="4.32">system isn&amp;#39;t working as well as they had</text>
  <text start="269.73" dur="6.06">hoped I guess and then this quote from</text>
  <text start="271.95" dur="5.54">another the pIJ secretary-general so the</text>
  <text start="275.79" dur="5.28">I guess the Palestinian Islamic Jihad</text>
  <text start="277.49" dur="7.51">secretary-general zi dal and nacala he</text>
  <text start="281.07" dur="8.22">told a Arabic language new sights dar Al</text>
  <text start="285" dur="5.58">Hayat we are going to war Netanyahu has</text>
  <text start="289.29" dur="2.97">crossed all the red lines and</text>
  <text start="290.58" dur="5.4">assassinating outcodes brigades</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="6.09">commander Baha abu allah we will respond</text>
  <text start="295.98" dur="5.16">forcefully so this is a quote I mean</text>
  <text start="298.35" dur="6.39">basically a declaration of jihad from a</text>
  <text start="301.14" dur="5.58">group that specializes in Jihad now of</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="3.21">course you know Israel is the power in</text>
  <text start="306.72" dur="2.88">that area and because they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="307.95" dur="3.719">backed by billions of US dollars and</text>
  <text start="309.6" dur="4.02">weapons and everything else so we every</text>
  <text start="311.669" dur="4.411">little rocket that gets sent in Israel</text>
  <text start="313.62" dur="4.15">is probably responded to with a missile</text>
  <text start="316.08" dur="4.33">sent back so this</text>
  <text start="317.77" dur="5.07">and well probably for either side</text>
  <text start="320.41" dur="3.99">unfortunately violence is a part of the</text>
  <text start="322.84" dur="4.65">Middle East it seems it&amp;#39;s built into the</text>
  <text start="324.4" dur="6.75">makeup now continuing on we also have</text>
  <text start="327.49" dur="5.459">senator what&amp;#39;s-her-name Hirono mazie</text>
  <text start="331.15" dur="5.84">Hirono right from democrat-controlled</text>
  <text start="332.949" dur="7.141">Hawaii she is telling people to look at</text>
  <text start="336.99" dur="5.829">climate change global warming like a</text>
  <text start="340.09" dur="4.199">religion now people on the right of</text>
  <text start="342.819" dur="3.75">often accused those on the left of being</text>
  <text start="344.289" dur="3.271">kind of religious about the climate</text>
  <text start="346.569" dur="3.03">change stuff but she&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="347.56" dur="3.96">encouraging it now because of course</text>
  <text start="349.599" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;ve lost all the arguments</text>
  <text start="351.52" dur="4.47">and and climate change is pretty much</text>
  <text start="353.919" dur="3.571">falling apart their cap-and-trade system</text>
  <text start="355.99" dur="4.019">is gonna be falling apart afterwards</text>
  <text start="357.49" dur="4.079">what what little they managed implement</text>
  <text start="360.009" dur="3.301">they didn&amp;#39;t get it too far in this</text>
  <text start="361.569" dur="3.511">country fortunately but you know some</text>
  <text start="363.31" dur="3.509">people like Al Gore have been made</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="3.869">billionaires off of this big lie that</text>
  <text start="366.819" dur="3.811">they&amp;#39;ve told us in order to nothing</text>
  <text start="368.949" dur="3.75">other than unite us against a common</text>
  <text start="370.63" dur="4.2">enemy that they could then tax us to</text>
  <text start="372.699" dur="3.451">death live basically that&amp;#39;s what global</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="4.17">warming was really about it was about</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="4.53">control and it was about having the</text>
  <text start="379" dur="3.33">government infiltrate every aspect of</text>
  <text start="380.68" dur="4.229">our lives in order to save us from a</text>
  <text start="382.33" dur="4.709">common enemy and control us including</text>
  <text start="384.909" dur="4.35">the capitalist system what&amp;#39;s left of it</text>
  <text start="387.039" dur="3.75">our free market what&amp;#39;s left of it so</text>
  <text start="389.259" dur="3.451">that they could go in pick winners and</text>
  <text start="390.789" dur="4.171">losers and business so that they could</text>
  <text start="392.71" dur="4.35">enrich themselves and have the greatest</text>
  <text start="394.96" dur="4.17">monopoly of all monopolies over every</text>
  <text start="397.06" dur="3.539">industry ever that&amp;#39;s basically what</text>
  <text start="399.13" dur="4.2">global warming was really about just</text>
  <text start="400.599" dur="5.521">like in the 80s I believe it was maybe a</text>
  <text start="403.33" dur="4.709">little early 7 no I think it wasn&amp;#39;t 80s</text>
  <text start="406.12" dur="4.949">they were talking about global cooling I</text>
  <text start="408.039" dur="4.56">know that&amp;#39;s happening now we&amp;#39;ve switched</text>
  <text start="411.069" dur="3.15">a global warming global cooling and now</text>
  <text start="412.599" dur="3.81">it seems to be going back in some ways</text>
  <text start="414.219" dur="3.241">to global cooling again you may hear my</text>
  <text start="416.409" dur="2.79">little one over there where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="417.46" dur="3.6">actually looking at some potential signs</text>
  <text start="419.199" dur="3.571">that not only are temperatures falling</text>
  <text start="421.06" dur="3.389">each year but there may be some</text>
  <text start="422.77" dur="4.139">potential ice age in the future or a</text>
  <text start="424.449" dur="4.321">global minimum solar minimum if you guys</text>
  <text start="426.909" dur="3.841">haven&amp;#39;t heard about that one yet please</text>
  <text start="428.77" dur="3.449">check out the global solar minimum</text>
  <text start="430.75" dur="3.659">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people out there that</text>
  <text start="432.219" dur="4.471">break down what that means but it means</text>
  <text start="434.409" dur="4.021">a colder world less solar radiation less</text>
  <text start="436.69" dur="4.56">sunlight coming to the planet and that</text>
  <text start="438.43" dur="5.039">means less food lower temperatures a</text>
  <text start="441.25" dur="3.69">period more of kind of a winter period</text>
  <text start="443.469" dur="3.81">because all things in nature go through</text>
  <text start="444.94" dur="4.11">cycles it can be great all the time so</text>
  <text start="447.279" dur="2.471">we&amp;#39;re going to more of a winter period</text>
  <text start="449.05" dur="2.5">for planet Earth</text>
  <text start="449.75" dur="3">and that could mean a lot of different</text>
  <text start="451.55" dur="2.85">things I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s gonna mean</text>
  <text start="452.75" dur="3.48">that we&amp;#39;re all gonna go extinct or</text>
  <text start="454.4" dur="4.05">anything but yeah it&amp;#39;s gonna be a little</text>
  <text start="456.23" dur="4.17">harder than typical so it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="458.45" dur="4.59">interesting that we&amp;#39;ve uncovered all</text>
  <text start="460.4" dur="5.13">these vast reserves of oil and coal</text>
  <text start="463.04" dur="5.58">right in time for that even so grand</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="4.56">solar minimum and maybe perhaps the</text>
  <text start="468.62" dur="3.36">average population we have to move a</text>
  <text start="470.09" dur="4.23">little out of the coldest areas of Earth</text>
  <text start="471.98" dur="4.38">for 30 years or something I don&amp;#39;t know I</text>
  <text start="474.32" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll even get that bad but</text>
  <text start="476.36" dur="3.51">there is something to this there is</text>
  <text start="477.83" dur="4.23">something to the sunlight and the</text>
  <text start="479.87" dur="3.6">planets temperature and that seems to me</text>
  <text start="482.06" dur="3.66">what&amp;#39;s really controlling global</text>
  <text start="483.47" dur="4.77">temperature swings in a cyclical nature</text>
  <text start="485.72" dur="4.47">now when you start trying to say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="488.24" dur="4.32">mankind&amp;#39;s fault and we need to tax</text>
  <text start="490.19" dur="4.02">everyone as the solution and of course a</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="2.91">lot of the the third world would be</text>
  <text start="494.21" dur="3.18">starved to death over some of the</text>
  <text start="495.47" dur="4.08">policies that these climate change</text>
  <text start="497.39" dur="3.87">fanatics are trying and I say that as a</text>
  <text start="499.55" dur="3.54">religious fanatic they&amp;#39;re there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.26" dur="3.63">what they sound like now especially with</text>
  <text start="503.09" dur="4.05">her saying things like this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="504.89" dur="4.23">trying to then starve the third world</text>
  <text start="507.14" dur="3.81">with their policies in order to save the</text>
  <text start="509.12" dur="3.96">world from this boogeyman that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="510.95" dur="4.58">actually hurt anything if you in fact</text>
  <text start="513.08" dur="5.19">had more carbon in the world and more</text>
  <text start="515.53" dur="5.949">co2 you would have a greater plant</text>
  <text start="518.27" dur="5.01">growth people buy co2 to put into their</text>
  <text start="521.479" dur="4.921">greenhouse to make their plants grow</text>
  <text start="523.28" dur="5.76">much faster much bigger much stronger so</text>
  <text start="526.4" dur="5.58">the more co2 the better actually</text>
  <text start="529.04" dur="5.49">so anyway I&amp;#39;m continuing on from that we</text>
  <text start="531.98" dur="6.42">also have and this guy&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="534.53" dur="6.33">be gross so if you got kids it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="538.4" dur="2.97">for earmuffs if you&amp;#39;re you know in mixed</text>
  <text start="540.86" dur="2.64">company</text>
  <text start="541.37" dur="5.82">look this is news this is unfortunately</text>
  <text start="543.5" dur="6.63">cultural commentary in LA now if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.19" dur="5.19">in I guess in lots of California because</text>
  <text start="550.13" dur="4.11">this is not just in LA but this woman</text>
  <text start="552.38" dur="3.9">was getting into her car to go out I</text>

  <text start="635.48" dur="3.69">are there that now they&amp;#39;re forcing</text>
  <text start="636.65" dur="5.129">vaccines on children too it&amp;#39;s a terrible</text>
  <text start="639.17" dur="4.71">place to be they&amp;#39;ve taken it over of</text>
  <text start="641.779" dur="3.391">course we also have daca protesters and</text>
  <text start="643.88" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s actually different groups of</text>
  <text start="645.17" dur="4.109">them out there which is kind of funny</text>
  <text start="647.57" dur="3.9">because for example National Immigration</text>
  <text start="649.279" dur="4.471">Law Center and then there&amp;#39;s some groups</text>
  <text start="651.47" dur="4.05">that are exclusively made up of people</text>
  <text start="653.75" dur="3.72">that are illegally here I wish ice had</text>
  <text start="655.52" dur="4.23">their member roster lists and locations</text>
  <text start="657.47" dur="3.54">and make this a lot faster especially</text>
  <text start="659.75" dur="3.209">because these are some of the ones</text>
  <text start="661.01" dur="4.26">organizing protests saying things like</text>
  <text start="662.959" dur="3.601">we&amp;#39;re gonna stay no matter what happens</text>
  <text start="665.27" dur="3.93">we should stay no matter what the</text>
  <text start="666.56" dur="5.82">Supreme Court says and guys the issue</text>
  <text start="669.2" dur="5.34">here is that clearly they&amp;#39;re it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="672.38" dur="3.57">complicated issue but parents brought</text>
  <text start="674.54" dur="3.21">kids here illegally</text>
  <text start="675.95" dur="4.8">those kids were born or raised here</text>
  <text start="677.75" dur="4.62">illegally they don&amp;#39;t belong here and</text>
  <text start="680.75" dur="3.959">there&amp;#39;s no place for them here</text>
  <text start="682.37" dur="5.07">necessarily unless there&amp;#39;s appropriate</text>
  <text start="684.709" dur="4.411">laws change now I don&amp;#39;t want them to</text>
  <text start="687.44" dur="3.75">stay I think that we have a lot of</text>
  <text start="689.12" dur="3.75">cultural invasion and my response to</text>
  <text start="691.19" dur="2.91">that is let&amp;#39;s close the doors let&amp;#39;s fix</text>
  <text start="692.87" dur="3.45">the problem and then we&amp;#39;ll talk about</text>
  <text start="694.1" dur="5.79">legal immigration from a merit-based</text>
  <text start="696.32" dur="5.76">perspective but I&amp;#39;m follow a tough-love</text>
  <text start="699.89" dur="3.69">sort of policy in my life because of my</text>
  <text start="702.08" dur="2.85">own personal experiences and I get the</text>
  <text start="703.58" dur="2.699">other side of it too that these are</text>
  <text start="704.93" dur="3.54">people who don&amp;#39;t necessarily even</text>
  <text start="706.279" dur="3.241">recognize that home country and they</text>
  <text start="708.47" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t really know what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="709.52" dur="4.2">into look blame your parents but on the</text>
  <text start="712.31" dur="3.12">other side of this</text>
  <text start="713.72" dur="3.78">Trump&amp;#39;s not trying to just kick them out</text>
  <text start="715.43" dur="3.36">he&amp;#39;s trying to do this a constitutional</text>
  <text start="717.5" dur="2.88">way what he&amp;#39;s trying to do is actually</text>
  <text start="718.79" dur="3.3">better for dhaka</text>
  <text start="720.38" dur="4.14">in fact he probably is leaning toward</text>
  <text start="722.09" dur="4.38">letting them stay let&amp;#39;s be honest but he</text>
  <text start="724.52" dur="3.99">wants to do it through Congress making</text>
  <text start="726.47" dur="4.44">actual laws that do this the right way</text>
  <text start="728.51" dur="3.78">rather than Obama&amp;#39;s executive order the</text>
  <text start="730.91" dur="3.18">way he did it which leaves a lot of</text>
  <text start="732.29" dur="3.75">things in limbo it creates a lot of</text>
  <text start="734.09" dur="3.87">problems it was not the right way to do</text>
  <text start="736.04" dur="3.63">it now the Democrats are trying to</text>
  <text start="737.96" dur="3.06">weaponize it emotionally of course and</text>
  <text start="739.67" dur="3.39">say that oh you&amp;#39;re trying to kick out</text>
  <text start="741.02" dur="4.41">all these poor kids and everything else</text>
  <text start="743.06" dur="4.29">but no not necessarily and if that were</text>
  <text start="745.43" dur="3.41">the case then great no I would support</text>
  <text start="747.35" dur="4.74">Trump even more if that were the case</text>
  <text start="748.84" dur="4.81">however he is just trying to do this to</text>
  <text start="752.09" dur="4.44">a constitutional way and let Congress</text>
  <text start="753.65" dur="7.14">make the decision whereas it was not</text>
  <text start="756.53" dur="6.57">Obama s decision to make so we also have</text>
  <text start="760.79" dur="3.72">I guess one last thing before we get</text>
  <text start="763.1" dur="3.63">into the stuff that I can&amp;#39;t touch on</text>
  <text start="764.51" dur="4.04">YouTube then we&amp;#39;re gonna go to another</text>

  <text start="792.5" dur="4.59">be in so rather than give YouTube and</text>
  <text start="794.45" dur="4.38">Google that power over us it&amp;#39;s better to</text>

  <text start="908.35" dur="4.109">that data guys it&amp;#39;s a bad idea because</text>
