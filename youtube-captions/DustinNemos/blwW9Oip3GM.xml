  <text start="65.07" dur="2.97">that level yet I mean if Don junior</text>
  <text start="66.6" dur="4.05">where to start flirting with Q it&amp;#39;d be a</text>
  <text start="68.04" dur="4.71">big deal so I understand that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="4.859">want to do that however I do want to</text>
  <text start="72.75" dur="6.63">bring you guys in the Q movement some</text>
  <text start="75.509" dur="6.511">very interesting and encouraging news in</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="4.02">this conference of a thousand people and</text>
  <text start="82.02" dur="2.73">this is where you would probably</text>
  <text start="83.4" dur="3.06">consider to be some of your more</text>
  <text start="84.75" dur="3.99">influential people within the magna</text>
  <text start="86.46" dur="5.25">movement right like Wayne Allyn root was</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="6.31">there many other people were there</text>
  <text start="91.71" dur="7.3">there were probably about four dozen</text>
  <text start="95.05" dur="5.7">queue people there that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="99.01" dur="3.81">difference for most of these conferences</text>
  <text start="100.75" dur="5.49">I&amp;#39;ve seen guys we are really starting to</text>
  <text start="102.82" dur="4.92">grow we are taking over the queue</text>
  <text start="106.24" dur="2.76">movement and I and I don&amp;#39;t mean that in</text>
  <text start="107.74" dur="2.93">a hostile way I mean that the queue</text>
  <text start="109" dur="4.14">movement is just growing so fast</text>
  <text start="110.67" dur="6.61">exponentially that more and more people</text>
  <text start="113.14" dur="5.82">are aware every day despite what the</text>
  <text start="117.28" dur="3.75">fake news would tell you despite them</text>
  <text start="118.96" dur="4.17">saying that we&amp;#39;re you know we&amp;#39;re just a</text>
  <text start="121.03" dur="4.949">fringe conspiracy cold too violent crazy</text>
  <text start="123.13" dur="6.81">Nazi rapists massages homophobic</text>
  <text start="125.979" dur="5.73">transphobic I don&amp;#39;t know but we are</text>
  <text start="129.94" dur="3.33">growing exponentially there were a lot</text>
  <text start="131.709" dur="3.571">of really good people Patriots that</text>
  <text start="133.27" dur="5.39">showed up to this thing and many of</text>
  <text start="135.28" dur="5.79">those Patriots were also cute people now</text>
  <text start="138.66" dur="4.69">you know they some of them are like</text>
  <text start="141.07" dur="4.11">where their cue hat and their cue stuff</text>
  <text start="143.35" dur="4.92">all out in front and that&amp;#39;s great and</text>
  <text start="145.18" dur="5.01">I&amp;#39;ve done that and I support that some</text>
  <text start="148.27" dur="4.29">of them are like subtle about it like</text>
  <text start="150.19" dur="6.18">Craig over there with his cue lapel pen</text>
  <text start="152.56" dur="5.64">you know Jim Watkins style hey and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="156.37" dur="4.29">and I&amp;#39;ve got me a cue lapel pen now too</text>
  <text start="158.2" dur="6.09">so it&amp;#39;s just a thing I guess we I had to</text>
  <text start="160.66" dur="5.1">get money but I just wanted to give you</text>
  <text start="164.29" dur="2.97">guys as encouraging news I mean if</text>
  <text start="165.76" dur="2.97">you&amp;#39;re really watching the trends and</text>
  <text start="167.26" dur="3.06">you&amp;#39;re going to for example if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="3.21">going to these events and these rallies</text>
  <text start="170.32" dur="3.21">and like the Trump rallies or some of</text>
  <text start="171.94" dur="3.93">the political conferences like I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="173.53" dur="4.56">doing and thank you guys for making that</text>
  <text start="175.87" dur="4.5">possible because it&amp;#39;s a lot of work but</text>
  <text start="178.09" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s very important work and that kind</text>
  <text start="180.37" dur="4.35">of networking is what really kind of</text>
  <text start="182.38" dur="5.09">makes other things possible that we do</text>
  <text start="184.72" dur="2.75">so</text>
  <text start="187.86" dur="5.25">would you see that many new cue faces or</text>
  <text start="190.41" dur="5.51">you see that many number changes in the</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="5.49">overall I mean you&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="195.92" dur="5.23">the growth not just in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="198.6" dur="4.14">movement of the magma normies and people</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="3.69">that are out there watching from their</text>
  <text start="202.74" dur="4.71">home but people who are at politically</text>
  <text start="204.84" dur="4.89">active people that are political</text>
  <text start="207.45" dur="3.75">activists even you could say but people</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="3.6">who are actually in positions of power</text>
  <text start="211.2" dur="5.04">and influence and reach and networking</text>
  <text start="213.33" dur="4.11">and and maybe have a lot of audience as</text>
  <text start="216.24" dur="3.84">you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of people there</text>
  <text start="217.44" dur="5.25">that are very influential and have no</text>
  <text start="220.08" dur="5.25">idea about you yet so we are getting to</text>
  <text start="222.69" dur="4.29">that point where you know it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="225.33" dur="3.96">not have heard about it and we&amp;#39;re almost</text>
  <text start="226.98" dur="4.14">to that point where you know how have</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="3.06">you not heard about you yet and how do</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="2.55">you not believe it you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.35" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s kind of where we&amp;#39;re getting to</text>
  <text start="233.67" dur="7.53">not yet but it&amp;#39;s coming with many of</text>
  <text start="238.02" dur="5.49">them and I will tell you this as well</text>
  <text start="241.2" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s a whole lot of people there that</text>
  <text start="243.51" dur="4.26">are pro-q that don&amp;#39;t necessarily want to</text>
  <text start="245.58" dur="3.81">openly come out and say it and I you</text>
  <text start="247.77" dur="3.689">know whatever your opinion on that is I</text>
  <text start="249.39" dur="5.25">understand that because some people have</text>
  <text start="251.459" dur="5.971">a lot to risk but you know see me to be</text>
  <text start="254.64" dur="5.19">pro-q and maybe they work for leftist</text>
  <text start="257.43" dur="4.02">company or maybe you know maybe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="259.83" dur="3.24">like on our side but they work for</text>
  <text start="261.45" dur="3.12">leftist company like a potential</text>
  <text start="263.07" dur="3.72">whistleblower right because we know that</text>
  <text start="264.57" dur="3.96">these companies are not all evil we know</text>
  <text start="266.79" dur="3.69">that there are pro-lifers like Eric</text>
  <text start="268.53" dur="3.99">Cochran from Pinterest we know that</text>
  <text start="270.48" dur="4.65">there are honest people like Zach for</text>
  <text start="272.52" dur="4.11">east from Google but both were there at</text>
  <text start="275.13" dur="2.76">the conference by the way Zach it was</text>
  <text start="276.63" dur="5.07">good to meet you Eric was good to see</text>
  <text start="277.89" dur="6.89">you again you know so we know that there</text>
  <text start="281.7" dur="3.08">are good people within these companies</text>
  <text start="285.19" dur="4.14">and just kind of an aside there really</text>
  <text start="287.19" dur="3.73">but not everyone can come out and be</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="4.38">pro-q Don jr. can&amp;#39;t come out and be</text>
  <text start="290.92" dur="4.86">pro-q right now like it would probably</text>
  <text start="293.71" dur="5.19">be bad optics if the conference had a</text>
  <text start="295.78" dur="5.58">cue and on breakout or or speaker or I</text>
  <text start="298.9" dur="4.38">mean I get that you know I have I have a</text>
  <text start="301.36" dur="3.45">larger audience than some of the people</text>
  <text start="303.28" dur="4.41">that do some of the speaking at these</text>
  <text start="304.81" dur="5.97">events which you know it it tells you</text>
  <text start="307.69" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s not just about audience or reach or</text>
  <text start="310.78" dur="4.62">size or anything like that it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="312.55" dur="4.02">optics as well and you know I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="315.4" dur="3.51">to give him too much crap I&amp;#39;ve teased</text>
  <text start="316.57" dur="4.68">them a lot about the whole D platforming</text>
  <text start="318.91" dur="5.55">and Jack the sobic and stuff and you</text>
  <text start="321.25" dur="4.59">know it&amp;#39;s not a big deal but I basically</text>

  <text start="408.11" dur="5.7">it was really startling it&amp;#39;s amazing to</text>
  <text start="412.13" dur="3.39">see that usually there&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="583.569" dur="4.2">that you can do from home you know</text>
  <text start="585.85" dur="4.019">sharing links that&amp;#39;s what I started</text>
  <text start="587.769" dur="4.47">doing when I was like 60 and I started</text>
  <text start="589.869" dur="4.291">sharing leaks I started doing some deep</text>
  <text start="592.239" dur="4.801">dives and research into things actually</text>
  <text start="594.16" dur="4.709">for those who don&amp;#39;t know I probably</text>
  <text start="597.04" dur="4.62">started the whole thing from video games</text>
  <text start="598.869" dur="5.37">I probably did if I think back really</text>
  <text start="601.66" dur="4.889">far back like Legend of Zelda video</text>
  <text start="604.239" dur="4.65">games like that like I started to learn</text>
  <text start="606.549" dur="3.991">as a child about symbolism and I started</text>
  <text start="608.889" dur="4.021">to research mythology things like that</text>
  <text start="610.54" dur="3.779">so when it came to Moloch and ball and</text>
  <text start="612.91" dur="3.149">all this other stuff that you guys are</text>
  <text start="614.319" dur="3.471">starting to learn about how those guys</text>
  <text start="616.059" dur="5.07">are in my video games when I was a kid</text>
  <text start="617.79" dur="4.719">you know they have Baal and Moloch all</text>
  <text start="621.129" dur="5.01">that stuff in some of these video games</text>
  <text start="622.509" dur="5.07">so you know and not in like a satanic</text>
  <text start="626.139" dur="3.63">way they just put it in as like the bad</text>
  <text start="627.579" dur="4.23">guy at the end of the game they sort of</text>
  <text start="629.769" dur="3.271">make it part of the story or something</text>
  <text start="631.809" dur="4.631">you don&amp;#39;t even necessarily know that</text>
  <text start="633.04" dur="5.2">these things are that but</text>
  <text start="636.44" dur="3.3">yeah so you know you&amp;#39;ve learned a lot</text>
  <text start="638.24" dur="3.18">about that and then it got me sort of</text>
  <text start="639.74" dur="3.18">interested in history and philosophy and</text>
  <text start="641.42" dur="3.42">some of the other things I&amp;#39;ve talked to</text>
  <text start="642.92" dur="7.11">you guys about how I got down the rabbit</text>
  <text start="644.84" dur="8.25">hole a bit but you know he it is</text>
  <text start="650.03" dur="4.38">interesting now I guess that kind of</text>
  <text start="653.09" dur="2.88">lost where I was going with that anyway</text>
  <text start="654.41" dur="6.18">since I&amp;#39;m driving but it is at least</text>
  <text start="655.97" dur="7.35">interesting now to see that all of those</text>
  <text start="660.59" dur="5.85">things that I learned in that time I can</text>
  <text start="663.32" dur="4.71">apply as a youtuber but this you know</text>
  <text start="666.44" dur="2.76">like I said earlier I started just</text>
  <text start="668.03" dur="3.45">sharing stuff I didn&amp;#39;t know what I was</text>
  <text start="669.2" dur="4.35">talking about it was 15 16 years old and</text>
  <text start="671.48" dur="4.02">there was no Trump there was no queue</text>
  <text start="673.55" dur="3.63">right there was just the everyone</text>
  <text start="675.5" dur="5.94">calling you a conspiracy theorist if you</text>
  <text start="677.18" dur="6.84">stepped out of line everyone and and you</text>
  <text start="681.44" dur="5.64">guys remember what that was like most of</text>
  <text start="684.02" dur="5.7">you have been around this this war for</text>
  <text start="687.08" dur="4.5">the truth I guess so so long now like</text>
  <text start="689.72" dur="5.72">myself many of you were new faces but I</text>
  <text start="691.58" dur="3.86">kind of call that like</text>
  <text start="695.91" dur="7.02">the lonely period or or where we were</text>
  <text start="700.889" dur="4.2">all ostracized we were all cut off from</text>
  <text start="702.93" dur="4.8">each other and and being a truth focused</text>
  <text start="705.089" dur="4.17">person was a very lonely thing you know</text>
  <text start="707.73" dur="3.24">most of you guys who&amp;#39;ve been around for</text>
  <text start="709.259" dur="3.361">a long time like maybe some of the 9/11</text>
  <text start="710.97" dur="5.01">truthers or something like that</text>
  <text start="712.62" dur="7.29">you guys know because you would be</text>
  <text start="715.98" dur="5.37">ridiculed and attacked and maybe lose</text>
  <text start="719.91" dur="2.94">opportunities and things like that for</text>
  <text start="721.35" dur="3.81">talking about truth like that because it</text>
  <text start="722.85" dur="4.469">was uncomfortable hell nowadays like</text>
  <text start="725.16" dur="4.14">everyone knows something&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="727.319" dur="3.601">everyone knows that that wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="729.3" dur="3">truth everyone knows that the</text>
  <text start="730.92" dur="3.33">government&amp;#39;s lying to them and the fake</text>
  <text start="732.3" dur="3.479">news is lying to them and there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="734.25" dur="3.69">some details we got to work out together</text>
  <text start="735.779" dur="4.74">but for the most part people are really</text>
  <text start="737.94" dur="6.54">awake to that being sick Trump and Q we</text>
  <text start="740.519" dur="6.781">have a team galvanized organized you</text>
  <text start="744.48" dur="4.38">know decentralized in a sense you know</text>

  <text start="782.02" dur="3.75">though they&amp;#39;re censoring us we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="783.52" dur="5.52">winning it on the back end like this is</text>

  <text start="789.04" dur="3.69">the build up the momentum then you get</text>
  <text start="791.17" dur="4.56">them the belief then you get the</text>
  <text start="792.73" dur="5.37">movement and then you get the</text>
  <text start="795.73" dur="4.02">counter-attacks and the results and by</text>
  <text start="798.1" dur="2.88">that I don&amp;#39;t mean physical violence of</text>
  <text start="799.75" dur="3.54">course I always have to clarify because</text>
  <text start="800.98" dur="4.32">you know that other jobs are someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="803.29" dur="4.59">gonna take my words out of context and</text>
  <text start="805.3" dur="4.68">try to call me violent but that means</text>
  <text start="807.88" dur="4.29">like political positions and</text>
  <text start="809.98" dur="4.98">appointments and influence a clouds and</text>
  <text start="812.17" dur="4.59">end in networking right that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="814.96" dur="3.3">we&amp;#39;ve been trying to develop like what</text>
  <text start="816.76" dur="3.69">if a bunch of queue people ran for</text>
  <text start="818.26" dur="4.95">office one day because of this movement</text>
