  <text start="82.619" dur="3.331">periscope I actually shared it on my</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="4.32">Twitter you guys could see her arguing</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="5.07">for yourself she shares her her five</text>

  <text start="117.21" dur="7.11">on numerous occasions as well what do</text>
  <text start="121.86" dur="4.049">you have rightly what can you do I guess</text>

  <text start="125.909" dur="4.951">just kind of have fun with them a little</text>
  <text start="128.819" dur="4.14">bit and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what this video is</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="2.91">about so I just wanted to put this out</text>

  <text start="141" dur="3.24">even know do we even need to worry about</text>
  <text start="142.14" dur="3.96">debates anymore like the reasoning</text>
  <text start="144.24" dur="4.68">people are on board the non reasoning</text>
  <text start="146.1" dur="5.01">people they you know if they have an</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="3.99">audience and and I feel like there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="151.11" dur="4.17">chance to have a useful debate where the</text>
  <text start="152.91" dur="3.69">audience can then be educated and I can</text>
  <text start="155.28" dur="2.82">get through to some of them then I will</text>
  <text start="156.6" dur="5.85">do a debate because I feel like it would</text>
  <text start="158.1" dur="6.69">be useful but at this point it&amp;#39;s like 5</text>
  <text start="162.45" dur="4.29">or 6 them you know they all say no they</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="3.18">don&amp;#39;t want to debate me Alex Jones that</text>

  <text start="172.5" dur="2.79">notice me they&amp;#39;ve reply to me and</text>
  <text start="173.91" dur="4.14">sometimes within I don&amp;#39;t want it to face</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="4.2">so we&amp;#39;ll see what happens down the road</text>
  <text start="178.05" dur="3.09">maybe she&amp;#39;ll change your mind after this</text>
  <text start="179.49" dur="5.82">but hey I just don&amp;#39;t see it happening</text>
