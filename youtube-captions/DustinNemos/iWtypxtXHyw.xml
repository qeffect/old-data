  <text start="18.02" dur="4.86">Nemo&amp;#39;s we are still trying to rebuild</text>
  <text start="20.54" dur="5.399">the channel from when we were band I did</text>
  <text start="22.88" dur="5.55">try to appeal the ban a second time with</text>
  <text start="25.939" dur="4.351">YouTube after all that news went around</text>
  <text start="28.43" dur="3.66">about how they were basically regretting</text>
  <text start="30.29" dur="3.75">what they did and and wanted to</text>
  <text start="32.09" dur="4.23">backtrack but it seems that they are</text>
  <text start="34.04" dur="5.43">still gonna keep me banned so the ban</text>
  <text start="36.32" dur="5.97">holds what can you do right we&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="39.47" dur="5.04">keep on keeping on now I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="42.29" dur="5.73">start today&amp;#39;s mega update with a quote</text>
  <text start="44.51" dur="7.62">from Andrew Breitbart who died six years</text>
  <text start="48.02" dur="6.33">ago today&amp;#39;s man was a hero and he was</text>
  <text start="52.13" dur="3.99">well known for many things but one of my</text>
  <text start="54.35" dur="3.84">favorite other quotes not this one was</text>
  <text start="56.12" dur="3.84">when he called out John Podesta asking</text>
  <text start="58.19" dur="3.75">how he was not a household name for</text>
  <text start="59.96" dur="5.01">being a pedophile that was pretty</text>
  <text start="61.94" dur="4.92">powerful but here&amp;#39;s a one that I here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="64.97" dur="4.68">one that I really like from him and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="66.86" dur="4.98">this walk toward the fire don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="69.65" dur="3.719">about what they call you all those</text>
  <text start="71.84" dur="3.75">things are set against you because they</text>
  <text start="73.369" dur="3.78">want to stop you in your tracks but if</text>
  <text start="75.59" dur="3.18">you keep going you&amp;#39;re sending a message</text>
  <text start="77.149" dur="3.661">to people who are rooting for you who</text>
  <text start="78.77" dur="6.629">are agreeing with you the message is</text>
  <text start="80.81" dur="5.61">that they can do it too powerful I think</text>
  <text start="85.399" dur="5.841">that man is going to go down in history</text>
  <text start="86.42" dur="7.559">as a hero let&amp;#39;s get into the news so</text>
  <text start="91.24" dur="5.29">Nunez is now going to have a slew of</text>
  <text start="93.979" dur="5.46">subpoenas coming for State Department</text>
  <text start="96.53" dur="6.179">officials for ignoring questions now</text>
  <text start="99.439" dur="7.981">that&amp;#39;s the next step in this whole memo</text>
  <text start="102.709" dur="6.891">corruption thing going on couple studies</text>
  <text start="107.42" dur="6.6">came out with medicinal marijuana</text>
  <text start="109.6" dur="7">cannabis was able to drastically reduce</text>
  <text start="114.02" dur="4.589">opioid usage in one study it was 63</text>
  <text start="116.6" dur="3.99">percent of patients were able to reduce</text>
  <text start="118.609" dur="4.08">or eliminate their opioid usage after</text>
  <text start="120.59" dur="4.47">six months and a second study showed</text>
  <text start="122.689" dur="4.5">that 96% of patients reported an</text>
  <text start="125.06" dur="4.589">improvement in their condition and half</text>
  <text start="127.189" dur="4.88">of them reported decreasing or</text>
  <text start="129.649" dur="5.851">eliminating their opioid usage so</text>
  <text start="132.069" dur="5.921">dramatic results against the major major</text>
  <text start="135.5" dur="3.75">opioid crisis in this country now I</text>
  <text start="137.99" dur="2.52">don&amp;#39;t like to talk about it but if</text>
  <text start="139.25" dur="3.48">you&amp;#39;ve been in the show a while I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="140.51" dur="4.32">mentioned you know I have family that</text>
  <text start="142.73" dur="2.98">were impacted by heroin and pills you</text>
  <text start="144.83" dur="2.76">know they got there</text>
  <text start="145.71" dur="4.68">pihl&amp;#39;s folks I got there from just</text>
  <text start="147.59" dur="5.05">buying pills from people you know for</text>
  <text start="150.39" dur="5.72">funsies I guess for for recreational</text>
  <text start="152.64" dur="6.69">usage or whatever they got there for</text>
  <text start="156.11" dur="4.63">with just basic I don&amp;#39;t know which ones</text>
  <text start="159.33" dur="3.3">you start with but the lower level</text>
  <text start="160.74" dur="3.99">weaker ones they got there with that and</text>
  <text start="162.63" dur="3.81">then before long it was getting</text>
  <text start="164.73" dur="3.27">expensive they had to up the the</text>
  <text start="166.44" dur="3.51">strength to get stronger ones more</text>
  <text start="168" dur="4.86">expensive than they go to street heroin</text>
  <text start="169.95" dur="4.41">and after that it&amp;#39;s game over I mean the</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="4.47">soul is like gone from the body</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="4.29">basically they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re not there</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="3.12">anymore they&amp;#39;re not people anymore I</text>
  <text start="178.65" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve had any personal</text>
  <text start="180.45" dur="3.9">experience with heroin addicts but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.49" dur="3.84">no good I mean what can you do except</text>
  <text start="184.35" dur="4.05">for just get away from them and cut them</text>
  <text start="186.33" dur="3.39">out of your life completely you know but</text>
  <text start="188.4" dur="5.43">not a day goes by where I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="5.73">about my little baby brother and when he</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="5.46">was cute you know when he was a kid he</text>
  <text start="195.45" dur="6.5">was really cute and my sister so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="5.7">why I&amp;#39;m care anyway</text>
  <text start="201.95" dur="5.32">so this is a big deal you know opioids</text>
  <text start="204.99" dur="5.9">are a legitimate issue and even Trump is</text>
  <text start="207.27" dur="6.57">talking about the crisis that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="210.89" dur="4.57">you know it doesn&amp;#39;t matter I&amp;#39;ve been a</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="4.38">couple places in the country everywhere</text>
  <text start="215.46" dur="5.01">I go I&amp;#39;m a small town person I prefer to</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="4.29">avoid the cities anyway but even in the</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="3.84">small towns there are major opioid</text>
  <text start="222.51" dur="3.45">crisis problems I mean the one I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="4.86">living in now actually has pretty high</text>
  <text start="225.96" dur="7.5">levels of hospitalizations for heroin</text>
  <text start="229.17" dur="5.91">overdose things like that it&amp;#39;s no fun</text>
  <text start="233.46" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s not good and it&amp;#39;s just showing</text>
  <text start="235.08" dur="3.81">society and I know a lot of people think</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="3.24">that marijuana is right up there with</text>
  <text start="238.89" dur="3.48">heroin and such but it&amp;#39;s really not if</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="3.15">you look into the science and the</text>
  <text start="242.37" dur="3.27">studies and the argument I like to talk</text>
  <text start="244.05" dur="5.31">about the argument and the facts and the</text>
  <text start="245.64" dur="4.23">reason marijuana it doesn&amp;#39;t really hurt</text>
  <text start="249.36" dur="2.76">anyone</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="4.86">and it may make people lazy that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="4.739">I understand that that is legitimate</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="6.48">argument some people do get lazy on</text>
  <text start="256.859" dur="6.331">marijuana but I think at least you know</text>
  <text start="261.21" dur="3.24">most of us already understand and most</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="4.08">of the country already agrees that</text>
  <text start="264.45" dur="4.83">medical marijuana which is legal in like</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="5.01">I think 49 states now it&amp;#39;s pretty much</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="5.16">everywhere already and it&amp;#39;s helping a</text>
  <text start="272.28" dur="4.47">lot you know this is this is a potent</text>
  <text start="274.44" dur="5.08">medicine against a legitimate crisis</text>
  <text start="276.75" dur="5.289">that ends lives and destroys people and</text>
  <text start="279.52" dur="5.609">it eats away at their soul I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.039" dur="4.5">really I don&amp;#39;t want to I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="285.129" dur="3.931">rant about marijuana cuz that&amp;#39;s this is</text>
  <text start="286.539" dur="4.201">the mag Update and this is just one</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="3.359">small part of it but I haven&amp;#39;t done any</text>
  <text start="290.74" dur="5.13">updates on the topic in a while so I</text>
  <text start="292.419" dur="5.49">just wrapped it all in together but this</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="3.63">is uh this is a big deal so if you&amp;#39;re if</text>
  <text start="297.909" dur="4.051">you&amp;#39;re still one of those people that is</text>
  <text start="299.5" dur="4.5">staunchly against it then please look</text>
  <text start="301.96" dur="6.29">into the effects look into the actual</text>
  <text start="304" dur="8.099">research go check out Oh what is the</text>
  <text start="308.25" dur="5.65">normal n OU r ml dot org I think it is</text>
  <text start="312.099" dur="6.361">they have a lot of great studies and</text>
  <text start="313.9" dur="6.9">science behind it and and and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="318.46" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s not a devil weed you know it is a</text>
  <text start="320.8" dur="5.369">plant and like anything else that can be</text>
  <text start="323.11" dur="4.92">misused and overused and isn&amp;#39;t good for</text>
  <text start="326.169" dur="5.041">you in too much quantity obviously</text>
  <text start="328.03" dur="4.59">everything in moderation but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="331.21" dur="4.16">one of those drugs that leads to more</text>
  <text start="332.62" dur="5.16">drugs right it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a plant that</text>
  <text start="335.37" dur="4.06">largely is not a gateway drug people</text>
  <text start="337.78" dur="3.569">often think that it&amp;#39;s a gateway drug and</text>
  <text start="339.43" dur="3.389">that&amp;#39;s kind of their big problem with it</text>
  <text start="341.349" dur="3.781">they think well first they&amp;#39;re smoking</text>
  <text start="342.819" dur="4.32">the pot and then they&amp;#39;re shooting up the</text>
  <text start="345.13" dur="4.379">drugs right that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not how it</text>
  <text start="347.139" dur="4.381">goes usually it&amp;#39;s the alcohol and pills</text>
  <text start="349.509" dur="7.02">that lead people to other harder</text>
  <text start="351.52" dur="8.91">substances anyway so the slew of</text>
  <text start="356.529" dur="5.851">subpoenas from the the Nunez group for</text>
  <text start="360.43" dur="5.039">the State Department officials is very</text>
  <text start="362.38" dur="5.039">exciting the cannabis thing may not may</text>
  <text start="365.469" dur="5.151">not excite you but as somebody who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.419" dur="7.5">seen the damages of opioid usage</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="6.12">firsthand in their own family I I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="374.919" dur="3.99">wait for them to just recreational</text>
  <text start="376.74" dur="6.37">medicinal everything legalize it across</text>
  <text start="378.909" dur="7.891">the board now we have something going on</text>
  <text start="383.11" dur="7.23">that is strange this is Q Anan stuff</text>
  <text start="386.8" dur="6.929">this is more hm but the administrator</text>
  <text start="390.34" dur="6.03">over there code monkey is discussing</text>
  <text start="393.729" dur="5.25">there that there is a DDoS attack on the</text>
  <text start="396.37" dur="5.729">board for those who are not aware DDoS</text>
  <text start="398.979" dur="5.581">is a denial of service dedicated denial</text>
  <text start="402.099" dur="4.47">of service basically someone&amp;#39;s using a</text>
  <text start="404.56" dur="4.26">lot of computers to attack your network</text>
  <text start="406.569" dur="5.641">and try to lag you up with the idea</text>
  <text start="408.82" dur="4.38">maybe of of costing you more resources</text>
  <text start="412.21" dur="4.47">wait</text>
  <text start="413.2" dur="6.33">senior time shutting down your website</text>
  <text start="416.68" dur="4.62">lagging you up or even maybe getting</text>
  <text start="419.53" dur="5.16">your ISP to kick you off from too much</text>
  <text start="421.3" dur="6.42">bandwidth or something so DDoS are a</text>
  <text start="424.69" dur="5.85">form of cyber attack and you can do that</text>
  <text start="427.72" dur="4.26">by having a virus that&amp;#39;s on millions of</text>
  <text start="430.54" dur="3.66">computers and then suddenly those</text>
  <text start="431.98" dur="3.96">computers unbeknownst to their owners</text>
  <text start="434.2" dur="4.11">start launching an attack against a</text>
  <text start="435.94" dur="3.84">website which is generally how it goes</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="2.85">it&amp;#39;s not generally just you know you</text>
  <text start="439.78" dur="3.57">have your own computers doing it</text>
  <text start="441.16" dur="4.62">generally it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a viral or</text>
  <text start="443.35" dur="4.08">something like that but here&amp;#39;s a quote</text>
  <text start="445.78" dur="3.87">from him on this and this is interesting</text>
  <text start="447.43" dur="4.28">he says never heard of a fuzz attack on</text>
  <text start="449.65" dur="4.35">a public service in such large numbers</text>
  <text start="451.71" dur="4.3">means whoever is attacking is either</text>
  <text start="454" dur="4.05">desperate or a child who doesn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="456.01" dur="4.73">better and children don&amp;#39;t normally have</text>
  <text start="458.05" dur="6.51">access to thousands of botnet computers</text>
  <text start="460.74" dur="6.4">so basically what we know is that</text>
  <text start="464.56" dur="5.36">someone is trying to silence not only</text>
  <text start="467.14" dur="6.3">the people on YouTube and free speech</text>
  <text start="469.92" dur="6.43">conservative influencers and and news</text>
  <text start="473.44" dur="5.28">people like myself if you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="476.35" dur="5.37">following you know that I was banned and</text>
  <text start="478.72" dur="5.52">and the people that were following me</text>
  <text start="481.72" dur="4.8">before we were up to 42,000 subscribers</text>
  <text start="484.24" dur="8.19">and they&amp;#39;re still haven&amp;#39;t found me you</text>
  <text start="486.52" dur="9.51">know that&amp;#39;s very troubling in this case</text>
  <text start="492.43" dur="5.7">I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say that someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.03" dur="4.26">trying to shut down talk of a queue and</text>
  <text start="498.13" dur="4.61">on many of the people that were banned</text>
  <text start="500.29" dur="4.89">on YouTube were were people like myself</text>
  <text start="502.74" dur="6.13">small youtubers who discussed the queue</text>
  <text start="505.18" dur="6.93">and on issue III I know that Lionel I</text>
  <text start="508.87" dur="4.65">think is still up and Infowars is still</text>
  <text start="512.11" dur="4.83">up barely I mean even they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="513.52" dur="4.92">threatened two strikes already and now</text>
  <text start="516.94" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re coming after Alex Jones with</text>
  <text start="518.44" dur="3.96">false allegations and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="520.39" dur="3.42">basically create manufactured case</text>
  <text start="522.4" dur="4.62">against him even Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.81" dur="4.71">former attorney basically trying to get</text>
  <text start="527.02" dur="4.09">him with some sort of trumped-up fake</text>
  <text start="528.52" dur="5.83">sexual assault charges</text>
  <text start="531.11" dur="6.18">so they are launching their</text>
  <text start="534.35" dur="6.27">counter-attacks there they are</text>
  <text start="537.29" dur="5.7">propaganda and their takedowns of their</text>
  <text start="540.62" dur="4.98">political opponents they&amp;#39;re using every</text>
  <text start="542.99" dur="6.03">little slimy trick in the swamp playbook</text>
  <text start="545.6" dur="7.44">and it&amp;#39;s interesting that they are</text>
  <text start="549.02" dur="7.86">they&amp;#39;re moving it seems primarily</text>
  <text start="553.04" dur="5.64">against cue non-related stuff now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="556.88" dur="3.03">already convinced that cue is legitimate</text>
  <text start="558.68" dur="3.9">and real I&amp;#39;ve done an hour-long</text>
  <text start="559.91" dur="4.41">presentation on just the evidence that</text>
  <text start="562.58" dur="3.39">he&amp;#39;s linked to Trump not even all of the</text>
  <text start="564.32" dur="5.73">things that he&amp;#39;s predicted but just the</text>
  <text start="565.97" dur="9.75">stuff where he is linked to Trump</text>
  <text start="570.05" dur="8.16">himself okay q is is most likely real</text>
  <text start="575.72" dur="3.57">the whole qa9 thing if you haven&amp;#39;t heard</text>
  <text start="578.21" dur="5.28">about it check out my video who is</text>
  <text start="579.29" dur="6.39">queueing on and the things that he leads</text>
  <text start="583.49" dur="4.17">us to discover and he doesn&amp;#39;t tell us</text>
  <text start="585.68" dur="4.8">the truth necessarily he gives us hints</text>
  <text start="587.66" dur="4.95">and we go find it for ourselves and that</text>
  <text start="590.48" dur="4.26">stuff is very disturbing if you&amp;#39;re an</text>
  <text start="592.61" dur="4.74">elite swamp creature like Hillary</text>
  <text start="594.74" dur="4.29">Clinton so the people that are trying to</text>
  <text start="597.35" dur="3.87">shut us down are likely the same people</text>
  <text start="599.03" dur="6.38">trying to shut down 8chan which is where</text>
  <text start="601.22" dur="8.49">q does his work does his information</text>

  <text start="823.12" dur="4.56">of talks about where things are going</text>
  <text start="824.47" dur="5.13">and I will also want to touch on</text>
  <text start="827.68" dur="3.27">centralized versus decentralized when</text>
  <text start="829.6" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re talking about crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="830.95" dur="6.68">because a lot of people especially among</text>
  <text start="834.61" dur="6.15">the faithful are of the opinion that</text>
  <text start="837.63" dur="6.649">digital currency equals bad or digital</text>
  <text start="840.76" dur="5.769">currency equals mark of the beast now</text>
  <text start="844.279" dur="4.201">as I understand it and I&amp;#39;m no religious</text>
  <text start="846.529" dur="3.36">scholar but as I understand it the mark</text>
  <text start="848.48" dur="3.87">of the beast is something that&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="849.889" dur="7.2">into you that is then used to control</text>
  <text start="852.35" dur="7.049">you so an RFID chip tied to a government</text>
  <text start="857.089" dur="4.381">currency like a digital dollar would</text>
  <text start="859.399" dur="3.44">basically fit the bill that would be the</text>
  <text start="861.47" dur="3.989">mark of the beast and they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="862.839" dur="4.3">yearly enough talked about putting RFID</text>
  <text start="865.459" dur="3.511">chips in people&amp;#39;s hands and and</text>
  <text start="867.139" dur="4.351">everything else and they have actually</text>
  <text start="868.97" dur="4.169">done it in some cases they even sell it</text>
  <text start="871.49" dur="3.12">as a good thing you know like put it in</text>
  <text start="873.139" dur="3.841">your kids so you can find them put it in</text>
  <text start="874.61" dur="3.599">your dog so you can find them my dog has</text>
  <text start="876.98" dur="4.109">a chip in between the shoulder blades</text>
  <text start="878.209" dur="5.67">that came with him as a puppy I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="881.089" dur="8.151">even want it there he was just a tiny</text>
  <text start="883.879" dur="5.361">little puppy when I got him at the pound</text>
  <text start="889.449" dur="5.05">that could be considered the mark of the</text>
  <text start="892.189" dur="5.27">beast RFID chips they&amp;#39;re so tiny they</text>
  <text start="894.499" dur="8.371">could hide in your skin you never know</text>
  <text start="897.459" dur="8.891">and I am definitely not for a government</text>
  <text start="902.87" dur="5.04">currency especially a government digital</text>
  <text start="906.35" dur="4.099">currency because at least with cash you</text>
  <text start="907.91" dur="6.179">still have a little bit of anonymity and</text>
  <text start="910.449" dur="5.411">on emiti is freedom folks when they can</text>
  <text start="914.089" dur="3.87">track you trace everything you do you</text>
  <text start="915.86" dur="3.419">lose your freedom they&amp;#39;ll use it against</text>
  <text start="917.959" dur="3.42">you every time because that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="919.279" dur="3.691">governments do they&amp;#39;re always always</text>
  <text start="921.379" dur="3.601">immoral always corrupt there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="922.97" dur="3.659">there&amp;#39;s no fixing government making it</text>
  <text start="924.98" dur="3.419">good again because it was never good in</text>
  <text start="926.629" dur="3.871">the first place and it never can be good</text>
  <text start="928.399" dur="6.271">it&amp;#39;s actually fundamentally based on</text>
  <text start="930.5" dur="7.86">violence and theft because all taxation</text>
  <text start="934.67" dur="7.92">is theft and all enforcement that is not</text>
  <text start="938.36" dur="9.15">self-defense is violence anyway</text>
  <text start="942.59" dur="6.78">so that is a centralized system on the</text>
  <text start="947.51" dur="4.86">other hand there is decentralized</text>
  <text start="949.37" dur="5.52">options now not to be confused with a</text>
  <text start="952.37" dur="5.76">digital dollar that&amp;#39;s controlled by the</text>
  <text start="954.89" dur="4.86">same central bank and manipulated in the</text>
  <text start="958.13" dur="4.08">same ways where they expand or shrink</text>
  <text start="959.75" dur="4.85">the money supply mess with interest</text>
  <text start="962.21" dur="8.03">rates create boom and bust cycles</text>
  <text start="964.6" dur="7.39">depressions and everything else a</text>
  <text start="970.24" dur="5.14">decentralized currency</text>
  <text start="971.99" dur="4.59">no one can mass print no one can set</text>
  <text start="975.38" dur="3.66">inflation rates</text>
  <text start="976.58" dur="5.34">no one can create boom bust cycles</text>
  <text start="979.04" dur="5.58">artificially no one can tinker with</text>
  <text start="981.92" dur="4.5">things like that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s peer to peer</text>
  <text start="984.62" dur="7.11">it functions like a round table of</text>
  <text start="986.42" dur="7.1">equals rather than a pyramid where the</text>
  <text start="991.73" dur="5.4">people at the top have all the power</text>
  <text start="993.52" dur="8.62">so a decentralized cryptocurrency for</text>
  <text start="997.13" dur="7.68">example bitcoin is not the mark of the</text>
  <text start="1002.14" dur="4.08">beast it is not a evil thing it is not a</text>

  <text start="1009.67" dur="8.19">go too far into it but if you were to</text>
  <text start="1014.98" dur="6.63">compare the two centralized currency is</text>
  <text start="1017.86" dur="5.07">corrupt and evil actually causes 90% of</text>
  <text start="1021.61" dur="2.76">our problems in the world it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1033.13" dur="6.14">poverty that we face which is</text>
  <text start="1034.569" dur="4.701">responsible for most of the crime so</text>
  <text start="1039.39" dur="5.61">a decentralized currency takes all that</text>

  <text start="1335.48" dur="5.85">do very well and they&amp;#39;re going to have a</text>
  <text start="1337.82" dur="6.9">huge explosion in their purchasing power</text>
  <text start="1341.33" dur="5.64">as the the real price of things</text>
  <text start="1344.72" dur="5.82">re-evaluate so silver for example is</text>
  <text start="1346.97" dur="5.43">that it&amp;#39;s 1913 prices roughly okay which</text>

  <text start="1362.15" dur="4.92">purchasing power and the dollar since</text>
  <text start="1364.34" dur="3.96">1913 because of all the crap that they</text>
  <text start="1367.07" dur="1.92">do with the money printing and</text>
  <text start="1368.3" dur="3.33">everything else</text>
  <text start="1368.99" dur="4.62">for example there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="1373.61" dur="4.83">I mean a couple years ago an economist</text>

  <text start="1378.44" dur="5.84">that&amp;#39;s stupid that&amp;#39;s know that would</text>
  <text start="1380.33" dur="7.61">never work that&amp;#39;s common now okay</text>
  <text start="1384.28" dur="7.21">they&amp;#39;re actually punishing savers so</text>
  <text start="1387.94" dur="5.26">this is all signs of a breakdown of the</text>
  <text start="1391.49" dur="4.61">system and everything that they try to</text>
  <text start="1393.2" dur="5.97">do to patch the holes in this leaky boat</text>
  <text start="1396.1" dur="3.76">create more holes it is not going to</text>
  <text start="1399.17" dur="2.4">last</text>
  <text start="1399.86" dur="4.9">okay</text>
  <text start="1401.57" dur="4.96">so I want you to be prepared and I want</text>
  <text start="1404.76" dur="4.23">people to understand that when this</text>
  <text start="1406.53" dur="4.77">happens if you have money in a 401k or</text>
  <text start="1408.99" dur="5.13">an IRA which is already screwing you</text>
  <text start="1411.3" dur="3.95">over anyway the government&amp;#39;s just gonna</text>
  <text start="1414.12" dur="3.42">take it folks</text>
  <text start="1415.25" dur="3.97">they&amp;#39;re just gonna take it just like</text>
  <text start="1417.54" dur="4.53">Obama did when he stole money from</text>
  <text start="1419.22" dur="7.26">private investors and and Fannie and</text>
  <text start="1422.07" dur="6.33">Freddie to take for Obama care it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1426.48" dur="3.42">gonna take it they did it in Greece they</text>
  <text start="1428.4" dur="2.73">do bail ends where they just go into</text>
  <text start="1429.9" dur="3.81">your bank account they take the money</text>
  <text start="1431.13" dur="4.41">they lock you out you can only take a</text>
  <text start="1433.71" dur="3.9">little bit out of your ATM a day all of</text>
  <text start="1435.54" dur="6.03">these systems that they control they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1437.61" dur="6.99">going to take from so what can you do to</text>
  <text start="1441.57" dur="4.77">prevent that well this is why we get</text>
  <text start="1444.6" dur="3.12">back to some of those crazy gold-bug</text>
  <text start="1446.34" dur="3.18">saying the gold and silver are</text>
  <text start="1447.72" dur="3.36">historically the only sure thing the</text>
  <text start="1449.52" dur="4.23">only safe store value and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1451.08" dur="3.93">entirely true but it&amp;#39;s a great it does</text>
  <text start="1453.75" dur="4.8">have a lot of truth in it gold and</text>
  <text start="1455.01" dur="5.43">silver are wonderful I was a silver bug</text>
  <text start="1458.55" dur="4.08">because silver is even better than gold</text>
  <text start="1460.44" dur="5.85">in terms of valuation historically gold</text>
  <text start="1462.63" dur="5.39">and silver was a 1 to 16 ratio 16 ounces</text>
  <text start="1466.29" dur="3.93">of silver would buy one ounce of gold</text>
  <text start="1468.02" dur="3.85">nowadays when we use more silver than</text>
  <text start="1470.22" dur="3.54">ever we&amp;#39;re actually facing a supply</text>
  <text start="1471.87" dur="3.69">crisis we&amp;#39;re using it faster than we can</text>
  <text start="1473.76" dur="4.77">mine it because of all the little things</text>
  <text start="1475.56" dur="6.87">that we put it in nowadays it&amp;#39;s at like</text>
  <text start="1478.53" dur="6.9">eighty to one okay so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1482.43" dur="9.12">there&amp;#39;s distortions in the value in that</text>
  <text start="1485.43" dur="8.49">little bug that is because of the ETFs</text>
  <text start="1491.55" dur="4.11">and and the ability of the big banks to</text>
  <text start="1493.92" dur="3.09">suppress things okay this wasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1495.66" dur="3.72">meant to be an economic video I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1497.01" dur="6.66">I&amp;#39;m trying to get it all out there kind</text>
  <text start="1499.38" dur="6.81">of an idea for you people so when you</text>
  <text start="1503.67" dur="3.81">have for example the price of silver</text>
  <text start="1506.19" dur="4.26">going higher and the banks are getting</text>
  <text start="1507.48" dur="5.64">nervous well they will the big players</text>
  <text start="1510.45" dur="4.92">will print more paper silver paper</text>
  <text start="1513.12" dur="3.93">silver contracts on the ETFs which trade</text>
  <text start="1515.37" dur="3.87">in the hundreds of the multiples of the</text>
  <text start="1517.05" dur="4.38">one which means that for every actual</text>
  <text start="1519.24" dur="6.36">physical silver ounce that they own they</text>
  <text start="1521.43" dur="6.24">will sell hundreds of ounces on paper so</text>
  <text start="1525.6" dur="3.54">it keeps going as a pie the legitimate</text>
  <text start="1527.67" dur="4.62">Ponzi scheme and say it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="1529.14" dur="5.72">legal it keeps going because no one</text>
  <text start="1532.29" dur="5.24">takes their physical silver</text>
  <text start="1534.86" dur="4.949">the day that it becomes apparent that</text>
  <text start="1537.53" dur="5.48">there&amp;#39;s a problem to the average person</text>
  <text start="1539.809" dur="7.801">and they begin to take physical silver</text>
  <text start="1543.01" dur="6.43">within a week I think very quickly there</text>
  <text start="1547.61" dur="4.86">will be no physical silver for sale</text>
  <text start="1549.44" dur="4.95">anywhere okay it will be be on sale no</text>
  <text start="1552.47" dur="4.32">one will even be offering it for sale in</text>
  <text start="1554.39" dur="4.32">any a price of dollars because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1556.79" dur="3.75">gonna be thinking I&amp;#39;ll get more in a</text>
  <text start="1558.71" dur="7.61">week than I will now I should just sit</text>
  <text start="1560.54" dur="9.3">on it okay the ETF thing will crash</text>
  <text start="1566.32" dur="6.07">there will be a sharp revaluation I mean</text>
  <text start="1569.84" dur="4.829">15 to 300 is definitely not beyond the</text>
  <text start="1572.39" dur="5.49">realm of possibility the same thing with</text>
  <text start="1574.669" dur="4.801">gold silver is just better so that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1577.88" dur="6.69">I&amp;#39;m a silver bug rather than a gold bug</text>
  <text start="1579.47" dur="8.31">poor man silver our poor man&amp;#39;s gold all</text>
  <text start="1584.57" dur="4.5">of this is going to happen because it is</text>
  <text start="1587.78" dur="4.08">mathematically inevitable it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1589.07" dur="5.63">mathematically certain all you have to</text>
  <text start="1591.86" dur="5.069">do to verify that is to compare the</text>
  <text start="1594.7" dur="3.82">unfunded liabilities you have to include</text>
  <text start="1596.929" dur="2.761">unfunded liabilities like Social</text>

  <text start="1599.69" dur="4.38">things that we owe that we do not have</text>
