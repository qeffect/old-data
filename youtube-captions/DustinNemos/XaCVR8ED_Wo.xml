  <text start="64.46" dur="5.1">is a video from sorry Posse Khan the</text>
  <text start="66.979" dur="5.28">powerful opioid painkiller basically</text>
  <text start="69.56" dur="4.349">just oxycontin when the company released</text>
  <text start="72.259" dur="3.511">that drug they claimed that it would be</text>
  <text start="73.909" dur="3.871">less addictive than other opioid</text>
  <text start="75.77" dur="3.9">medications that was a lie</text>
  <text start="77.78" dur="4.08">at some point introdu Department knew it</text>
  <text start="79.67" dur="4.23">was a lie but they kept telling it and</text>
  <text start="81.86" dur="4.32">multitudes died as a result</text>
  <text start="83.9" dur="4.23">oxycontin turns out to be terrifyingly</text>
  <text start="86.18" dur="3.929">addictive it has helped drive a drug</text>
  <text start="88.13" dur="4.11">epidemic in this country that has killed</text>
  <text start="90.109" dur="3.12">more Americans than any conflict since</text>
  <text start="92.24" dur="3">the Second World War</text>
  <text start="93.229" dur="4.14">we now know that Purdue Pharma</text>
  <text start="95.24" dur="3.93">understood exactly what they were doing</text>
  <text start="97.369" dur="3.24">recent legal filings have exposed</text>
  <text start="99.17" dur="2.969">internal communications within the</text>
  <text start="100.609" dur="3.241">company and they showed that the</text>
  <text start="102.139" dur="3.991">company&amp;#39;s sales staff were pressured to</text>
  <text start="103.85" dur="5.159">sell as many pills as they could without</text>
  <text start="106.13" dur="5.07">regard to the risk physicians were urged</text>
  <text start="109.009" dur="4.411">prescribed the highest possible doses of</text>
  <text start="111.2" dur="4.349">the drug in order to maximize profits</text>
  <text start="113.42" dur="4.71">when evidence emerged that people were</text>
  <text start="115.549" dur="4.5">becoming junkies as a result Purdue</text>
  <text start="118.13" dur="3.72">Pharma responded by shaming the</text>
  <text start="120.049" dur="4.051">patient&amp;#39;s they had hooked on their drug</text>
  <text start="121.85" dur="4.079">they called them degenerate criminals</text>
  <text start="124.1" dur="3.539">essentially well refusing to take any</text>
  <text start="125.929" dur="4.47">responsibility at all for the human</text>
  <text start="127.639" dur="5.971">carnage they caused it&amp;#39;s hard to imagine</text>
  <text start="130.399" dur="5.31">an uglier story throughout all of it we</text>
  <text start="133.61" dur="4.14">should know produce Pharma Purdue Pharma</text>
  <text start="135.709" dur="4.101">Zoners the Sackler family grew</text>
  <text start="137.75" dur="4.77">spectacularly rich looking back</text>
  <text start="139.81" dur="4.66">repulsively rich earlier this year the</text>
  <text start="142.52" dur="4.17">Sackler estimated to have more than 12</text>
  <text start="144.47" dur="4.26">billion dollars in the bank thanks to</text>
  <text start="146.69" dur="3.78">the opioid epidemic the Sackler family</text>
  <text start="148.73" dur="4.74">is now one of the 20 richest families in</text>
  <text start="150.47" dur="5.13">this country in the last few years proof</text>
  <text start="153.47" dur="4.4">Pharma has faced a wave of lawsuits from</text>
  <text start="155.6" dur="4.4">the people in places devastated by its</text>
  <text start="157.87" dur="4.199">now apparently the company has made a</text>
  <text start="160" dur="3.989">settlement offer to resolve all of these</text>
  <text start="162.069" dur="3.711">outstanding lawsuits Purdue Pharma is</text>
  <text start="163.989" dur="3.841">willing to pay twelve billion dollars</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="3.76">three billion of that would come from</text>
  <text start="167.83" dur="4.739">the Sackler family which would then give</text>
  <text start="169.54" dur="4.35">up control of Purdue Pharma that sounds</text>
  <text start="172.569" dur="3.301">like a lot of money well let&amp;#39;s put it</text>
  <text start="173.89" dur="4.59">into some perspective the massive</text>
  <text start="175.87" dur="5.399">tobacco settlement of 1998 totaled about</text>
  <text start="178.48" dur="4.38">two hundred and six billion dollars now</text>
  <text start="181.269" dur="4.351">no one would defend cigarette smoking</text>
  <text start="182.86" dur="4.5">over time it will kill you but marbles</text>
  <text start="185.62" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t cut down young people in their</text>
  <text start="187.36" dur="5.22">prime smoking doesn&amp;#39;t turn teenagers</text>
  <text start="189.91" dur="4.32">into zombies it hasn&amp;#39;t destroyed entire</text>
  <text start="192.58" dur="3.75">towns throughout the Midwest in New</text>
  <text start="194.23" dur="4.589">England the sackler czar hoping to get</text>
  <text start="196.33" dur="4.85">off with just 6% of what the tobacco</text>
  <text start="198.819" dur="5.371">companies paid more than 20 years ago</text>
  <text start="201.18" dur="4.75">that feels wrong but it&amp;#39;s easy to see</text>
  <text start="204.19" dur="3.54">what the Sackler czar for it according</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="3.839">to Bloomberg the Sackler would retain at</text>
  <text start="207.73" dur="5.729">least a billion and a half dollars after</text>
  <text start="209.769" dur="5.761">the settlement is that justice no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="213.459" dur="3.931">not but unfortunately it&amp;#39;s a now</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="4.08">familiar pattern in American life a</text>
  <text start="217.39" dur="4.469">ruling class gets incredibly rich by</text>
  <text start="219.61" dur="3.87">wrecking our country in this case by</text>
  <text start="221.859" dur="4.231">killing many thousands of young people</text>
  <text start="223.48" dur="4.56">they get caught doing it details emerge</text>
  <text start="226.09" dur="4.019">everyone in Washington New York and Los</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="5.009">Angeles spends a week pretending to be</text>
  <text start="230.109" dur="5.19">horrified and concerned and then nothing</text>
  <text start="233.049" dur="4.801">happens not a single one of the</text>
  <text start="235.299" dur="4.591">perpetrators ever goes to jail nobody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.85" dur="4.05">ever really punished we&amp;#39;ve seen it again</text>
  <text start="239.89" dur="5.069">and again including in the financial</text>
  <text start="241.9" dur="4.919">crisis of 2008 in the end and in this</text>
  <text start="244.959" dur="3.541">case they take their blood money and</text>
  <text start="246.819" dur="4.021">they head to st. Bart&amp;#39;s for Thanksgiving</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="5.579">and they laugh they get away with it</text>
  <text start="250.84" dur="4.799">every single time for once would be nice</text>
  <text start="254.079" dur="3.331">if people like the Sackler got what they</text>
  <text start="255.639" dur="4.731">deserve it might make the rest of us a</text>
  <text start="257.41" dur="2.96">little less cynical</text>
  <text start="264.96" dur="3.57">have it so that was what I wanted to</text>
  <text start="266.55" dur="3.45">share with you guys this morning it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="268.53" dur="4.56">not like a full news video or anything</text>
  <text start="270" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s just just some information that</text>
  <text start="273.09" dur="4.23">everyone should hear in regards to the</text>
  <text start="275.28" dur="4.08">way our Big Pharma system works people</text>
  <text start="277.32" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t want to believe it people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="279.36" dur="6.72">want to believe that doctors are killing</text>
  <text start="282.6" dur="5.789">us and they are and it&amp;#39;s people like</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="4.619">this that created that situation by</text>
  <text start="288.389" dur="4.081">pushing them to do so people like this</text>
  <text start="290.699" dur="3.391">that rigged the education system to</text>
  <text start="292.47" dur="5.819">teach them that that was the only way</text>
  <text start="294.09" dur="6.63">and that&amp;#39;s unfortunately the way it</text>
  <text start="298.289" dur="4.321">works these days so that&amp;#39;s pretty much</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="3.93">what I wanted to cover I I&amp;#39;ll dive into</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="4.71">a few other quick things real fast</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="6.449">because they&amp;#39;re also very important we</text>
  <text start="307.32" dur="5.849">also have another equally important</text>
  <text start="311.099" dur="3.931">issue I mean this Big Pharma thing is</text>

  <text start="390.949" dur="6.311">there&amp;#39;s also another pattern emerging</text>
