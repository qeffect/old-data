  <text start="131.22" dur="2.84">they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="132.44" dur="4.44">have a definition because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="134.06" dur="5.4">such thing as an assault weapon in the</text>
  <text start="136.88" dur="4.71">sense of your rifle or any of the other</text>
