  <text start="38.25" dur="5.01">word from our sponsors please hang</text>
  <text start="40.05" dur="5.25">around there was a time when I had my</text>
  <text start="43.26" dur="4.95">head in the sand then I found out that</text>
  <text start="45.3" dur="5.82">Howard platters pass lies for truth and</text>

  <text start="73.619" dur="4.25">stand up speak up</text>
  <text start="81.369" dur="4.14">all right so first we&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text>
  <text start="83.74" dur="3.839">about the international scene this</text>
  <text start="85.509" dur="3.121">little thing that just happened is kind</text>
  <text start="87.579" dur="3.811">of a big deal</text>
  <text start="88.63" dur="5.879">basically the u.s. just threatened to</text>
  <text start="91.39" dur="6.47">place sanctions on even allies if they</text>
  <text start="94.509" dur="6.39">go along with the Nord Stream pipeline</text>
  <text start="97.86" dur="5.74">now basically what&amp;#39;s happening over in</text>
  <text start="100.899" dur="5.25">Europe is that there are some competing</text>
  <text start="103.6" dur="5.79">pipelines that will be pumping oil from</text>
  <text start="106.149" dur="5.371">example Russia to example Germany and it</text>
  <text start="109.39" dur="5.069">will spread all across Europe it&amp;#39;ll it</text>
  <text start="111.52" dur="6.709">will it&amp;#39;ll do damage to the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="114.459" dur="6.511">supremacy over energy and it will also</text>
  <text start="118.229" dur="5.261">pull allies that are sort of dependent</text>
  <text start="120.97" dur="4.53">on the u.s. more towards this sort of</text>
  <text start="123.49" dur="4.559">Eastern Bloc with Russia and China and</text>
  <text start="125.5" dur="4.14">the Chinese silk road and of course all</text>
  <text start="128.049" dur="3.331">of these nations are already bailing out</text>
  <text start="129.64" dur="3.51">of the dollar as fast as they can</text>
  <text start="131.38" dur="3.84">especially the central banks that are</text>
  <text start="133.15" dur="4.02">buying gold so you&amp;#39;re seeing some some</text>
  <text start="135.22" dur="4.2">very interesting things happen and this</text>
  <text start="137.17" dur="5.28">is not a good thing this this particular</text>
  <text start="139.42" dur="5.64">move basically says to our allies we</text>
  <text start="142.45" dur="5.069">will punish you for peacefully engaging</text>
  <text start="145.06" dur="3.929">in commerce with your neighbors and our</text>
  <text start="147.519" dur="3.75">allies are not in a position where they</text>
  <text start="148.989" dur="4.5">necessarily need to stick with us you</text>
  <text start="151.269" dur="4.831">know most of them are deep stack deep</text>
  <text start="153.489" dur="5.791">state type globalist controlled nations</text>
  <text start="156.1" dur="6.78">example Germany with Angela Merkel or</text>
  <text start="159.28" dur="6">Merkel and then we also have you know a</text>
  <text start="162.88" dur="4.199">Krong situations like that so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="165.28" dur="3.57">looking for any excuse that they can to</text>
  <text start="167.079" dur="4.831">pull further away from president Trump</text>
  <text start="168.85" dur="5.789">into week in the US now it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="171.91" dur="4.29">that these sanctions which sanctions are</text>
  <text start="174.639" dur="3.541">basically inactive or if you think about</text>
  <text start="176.2" dur="3.84">it is economic war at the very least in</text>
  <text start="178.18" dur="4.559">it that has real consequences for real</text>
  <text start="180.04" dur="4.8">people especially the the poorest but</text>
  <text start="182.739" dur="3.9">you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a non violent form</text>
  <text start="184.84" dur="5.22">possibly if you think of it you know not</text>
  <text start="186.639" dur="5.581">overt violence at least of war and you</text>
  <text start="190.06" dur="4.11">know while I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not passing</text>
  <text start="192.22" dur="4.079">judgment on this and maybe there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="194.17" dur="5.399">to it than I know I just wanted to point</text>
  <text start="196.299" dur="5.22">out that this is basically pushing our</text>
  <text start="199.569" dur="4.111">allies away from us and right into the</text>
  <text start="201.519" dur="3.481">open arms of Russia and China and</text>
  <text start="203.68" dur="4.02">everything else happening so this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="205" dur="4.439">a good thing we don&amp;#39;t really have the</text>
  <text start="207.7" dur="3.63">leverage that we need and it seems more</text>
  <text start="209.439" dur="5.491">like we&amp;#39;re trying to bully people as a</text>
  <text start="211.33" dur="6.18">country in this instance rather than</text>
  <text start="214.93" dur="4.529">work with others or be leaders it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="217.51" dur="3.089">like you can&amp;#39;t do business with them</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="3.39">because it hurts us so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="220.599" dur="4.95">punish you if you even try and that</text>
  <text start="222.849" dur="4.381">doesn&amp;#39;t that doesn&amp;#39;t look well on us it</text>
  <text start="225.549" dur="3.27">doesn&amp;#39;t bode well for the future and</text>
  <text start="227.23" dur="3.899">certainly with everything going on right</text>
  <text start="228.819" dur="6.12">now with this great awakening globally</text>
  <text start="231.129" dur="6.53">of corruption versus globalism or I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="234.939" dur="5.461">sorry of the truth versus globalism and</text>
  <text start="237.659" dur="4.89">corruption then you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="4.32">some very serious and interesting</text>
  <text start="242.549" dur="5.291">international moves from all the power</text>
  <text start="244.72" dur="5.34">players mostly away from the United</text>
  <text start="247.84" dur="3.959">States so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s looking like it</text>
  <text start="250.06" dur="4.14">could be us and the UK and in Poland</text>
  <text start="251.799" dur="3.601">versus like and maybe Brazil versus a</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="4.05">lot of other people economically</text>
  <text start="255.4" dur="4.95">speaking and that&amp;#39;s not good so you know</text>
  <text start="258.25" dur="4.56">by silver if you get a chance</text>
  <text start="260.35" dur="4.5">stock up on whatever necessities you may</text>
  <text start="262.81" dur="5.37">need in case we have hard times or</text>
  <text start="264.85" dur="5.34">there&amp;#39;s you know low quantities or maybe</text>
  <text start="268.18" dur="5.28">some shortages in the food aisle at the</text>
  <text start="270.19" dur="4.65">store things like that not because of</text>
  <text start="273.46" dur="3.48">this this is not going to trigger that</text>
  <text start="274.84" dur="4.65">I&amp;#39;m just saying that overall this</text>
  <text start="276.94" dur="5.58">economic trend of which this is one tiny</text>
  <text start="279.49" dur="6.39">point of many other points is pointing</text>
  <text start="282.52" dur="5.48">toward the collapse and I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="285.88" dur="4.92">about a RIA</text>
  <text start="288" dur="5.08">depression okay I&amp;#39;m not talking about a</text>
  <text start="290.8" dur="5.16">recession I&amp;#39;m talking about a collapse</text>
  <text start="293.08" dur="4.8">of a lot of the economic activity of the</text>
  <text start="295.96" dur="3.959">world something is coming that&amp;#39;s big and</text>
  <text start="297.88" dur="5.219">I think it has to do with the popping of</text>
  <text start="299.919" dur="5.131">the everything bubble and the massive</text>
  <text start="303.099" dur="3.06">amount of money spending and debt that</text>
  <text start="305.05" dur="3.54">the Federal Reserve and other central</text>
  <text start="306.159" dur="4.801">banks are doing just printing god knows</text>
  <text start="308.59" dur="6.12">how much money and and of course that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="310.96" dur="6.179">being corrupt corruptly used as well so</text>
  <text start="314.71" dur="4.019">with all of that liquidity out there</text>
  <text start="317.139" dur="3.15">with all of that just free money</text>
  <text start="318.729" dur="3.511">printing imagine what&amp;#39;s happening to</text>
  <text start="320.289" dur="3.841">your savings in the bank right because</text>
  <text start="322.24" dur="3.48">now there&amp;#39;s twice as many dollars as</text>
  <text start="324.13" dur="2.969">there were before or or whatever the</text>
  <text start="325.72" dur="3.3">number is you know trillions of new</text>
  <text start="327.099" dur="3.901">dollars being printed and if that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="329.02" dur="5.16">case that means that your dollar has</text>
  <text start="331" dur="5.31">less value however we&amp;#39;re still the</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="4.56">strongest currency out there for now</text>
  <text start="336.31" dur="3.78">although we&amp;#39;re losing that market share</text>
  <text start="338.74" dur="4.289">especially if you look at central bank</text>
  <text start="340.09" dur="5.79">reserves of gold going up central bank</text>
  <text start="343.029" dur="4.701">reserves of dollars going down so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345.88" dur="3.29">seeing the overall trend it looks</text>
  <text start="347.73" dur="3.36">that now I&amp;#39;m not saying we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="349.17" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re gonna starve to death or anything</text>
  <text start="351.09" dur="3.18">Trump is great with the economy and I</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="3.72">think he&amp;#39;s a strong leader and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="354.27" dur="3.63">gonna come through this but you have to</text>
  <text start="356.58" dur="3.36">understand that over a hundred years of</text>
  <text start="357.9" dur="4.47">economic distortion from the central</text>
  <text start="359.94" dur="4.23">bank since 1913 when they snuck that</text>
  <text start="362.37" dur="3">monster in on us for the second time</text>
  <text start="364.17" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;ve had to deal with the central bank</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="4.74">in this country the first one was beaten</text>
  <text start="367.41" dur="5.52">by Andrew Jackson when he says I killed</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="4.98">the bank right so that and they tried to</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="3.54">kill him as well for that so you know we</text>
  <text start="375.09" dur="3.42">have a president now I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.47" dur="3.81">gonna go after the Federal Reserve but</text>
  <text start="378.51" dur="3.87">you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t escape a hundred</text>
  <text start="380.28" dur="4.19">years of economic corruption and</text>
  <text start="382.38" dur="4.26">distortion and looting and theft and</text>
  <text start="384.47" dur="4.45">treason like we&amp;#39;ve been dealing with</text>
  <text start="386.64" dur="4.08">without some pain and and some</text>
  <text start="388.92" dur="3.69">consequences economically speaking to</text>
  <text start="390.72" dur="4.35">that and you know I like to look at it</text>
  <text start="392.61" dur="5.13">from a positive angle I hope we will get</text>
  <text start="395.07" dur="4.8">through it as low pain as possible and I</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="4.58">expect that we will learn some hard</text>
  <text start="399.87" dur="5.28">lessons about being fiscally responsible</text>
  <text start="402.32" dur="4.33">being frugal you know people that live</text>
  <text start="405.15" dur="3.75">through the Great Depression they have</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="4.23">money stocked in US and a bed mattress</text>
  <text start="408.9" dur="4.14">or a pillowcase or a sock or something</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="3.6">you may see people do that again</text>
  <text start="413.04" dur="3.78">you know people started to learn about</text>
  <text start="414.48" dur="4.26">the value of real money again like gold</text>
  <text start="416.82" dur="3.57">and silver things like that you may see</text>
  <text start="418.74" dur="3.03">that again people in the u.s. don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="420.39" dur="3.18">know what gold and silver is half the</text>
  <text start="421.77" dur="3.96">time maybe it&amp;#39;s just like a shiny</text>
  <text start="423.57" dur="5.13">jewelry or a wrapper for candy that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.73" dur="5.7">about it so continuing on talking about</text>
  <text start="428.7" dur="6.42">waste and corruption Rand Paul releases</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="7.08">his annual wasteful spending report or</text>
  <text start="435.12" dur="5.1">Festivus the Seinfeld thing and he says</text>
  <text start="438.51" dur="7.08">there was ten million dollars granted</text>
  <text start="440.22" dur="7.26">for a green new deal in Peru what we</text>
  <text start="445.59" dur="3.45">don&amp;#39;t even have any support for a green</text>
  <text start="447.48" dur="2.94">new deal here in the United States why</text>
  <text start="449.04" dur="3.12">would we be paying ten million dollars</text>
  <text start="450.42" dur="3.9">for some other country to develop a</text>
  <text start="452.16" dur="3.6">green new deal folks we are being looted</text>
  <text start="454.32" dur="4.26">everything the government takes from us</text>
  <text start="455.76" dur="4.47">is to basically break our legs and sell</text>
  <text start="458.58" dur="4.53">us a wheelchair and say aren&amp;#39;t you so</text>
  <text start="460.23" dur="6.93">lucky to have the government continuing</text>
  <text start="463.11" dur="6.33">on big news ignored by fake news media</text>
  <text start="467.16" dur="4.65">income fake news media income equality</text>
  <text start="469.44" dur="5.52">is narrowing under President Trump so</text>
  <text start="471.81" dur="5.34">income equality is actually going down</text>
  <text start="474.96" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s very cool to see and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="477.15" dur="4.05">something that you&amp;#39;re going to expect to</text>
  <text start="478.5" dur="3.06">see from the leftist media which of</text>
  <text start="481.2" dur="2.73">course</text>
  <text start="481.56" dur="4.44">trying to paint Trampas you know as the</text>
  <text start="483.93" dur="3.75">rich bad guy whereas Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="486" dur="4.23">things that are actually helping the</text>
  <text start="487.68" dur="4.98">poorest among us to to close that gap</text>
  <text start="490.23" dur="4.439">and be more competitive deregulations</text>
  <text start="492.66" dur="3.96">lowering taxes getting the government</text>
  <text start="494.669" dur="3.541">off our backs before they break our legs</text>
  <text start="496.62" dur="2.94">and sell us a wheelchair and tell us to</text>
  <text start="498.21" dur="5.22">say thank you for it</text>
  <text start="499.56" dur="7.14">now also continuing on Trump has quietly</text>
  <text start="503.43" dur="6.6">appointed 25 percent okay of Circuit</text>
  <text start="506.7" dur="5.67">Court judges that&amp;#39;s a big deal folks and</text>
  <text start="510.03" dur="5.069">there was just a little spree of the</text>
  <text start="512.37" dur="5.609">Senate confirming more judges recently</text>
  <text start="515.099" dur="4.581">so you know we&amp;#39;re stacking the deck long</text>
  <text start="517.979" dur="4.56">term I mean these are long term</text>
  <text start="519.68" dur="4.78">appointments even lifelong appointments</text>
  <text start="522.539" dur="4.261">we&amp;#39;re stacking the deck for the next 50</text>
  <text start="524.46" dur="4.89">years with young conservative rule of</text>
  <text start="526.8" dur="4.46">law judges that&amp;#39;s a big deal even if</text>
  <text start="529.35" dur="5.04">they took him out today with impeachment</text>
  <text start="531.26" dur="5.079">assassination or boredom right because</text>

  <text start="538.29" dur="3.87">got nothing so all they can do is just</text>
  <text start="540.3" dur="3.69">keep repeating the same junk over and</text>
  <text start="542.16" dur="4.86">over which are lies and insults and</text>
  <text start="543.99" dur="6.39">slurs and of course the censorship</text>
  <text start="547.02" dur="6.65">that&amp;#39;s the real threat so just to see</text>
  <text start="550.38" dur="6.18">the change in our judicial branch is</text>
  <text start="553.67" dur="6.52">massive not to mention the Supreme Court</text>

  <text start="632.29" dur="3.6">reading of this article it has to do</text>
  <text start="633.58" dur="6.48">with the Dillion rule which is not a law</text>
  <text start="635.89" dur="6.15">it is a standard or policy that has been</text>
  <text start="640.06" dur="4.05">enacted or embraced by 39 different</text>

  <text start="644.11" dur="3.27">the rule of law that doesn&amp;#39;t mean it has</text>
  <text start="645.46" dur="5.22">the power of law so it&amp;#39;d be good to see</text>
  <text start="647.38" dur="5.43">something - to challenge that here so</text>
  <text start="650.68" dur="4.53">four genius set a precedent with the</text>
  <text start="652.81" dur="4.02">dillons rule back in 1896 and is</text>
  <text start="655.21" dur="4.08">considered one of the strictest rule</text>

  <text start="659.29" dur="4.65">applied consistently ever since</text>
  <text start="661.33" dur="4.37">so taking power from local governments</text>
  <text start="663.94" dur="4.65">and centralizing it at the state level</text>
  <text start="665.7" dur="5.53">but it&amp;#39;s important to note that Dillon&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="668.59" dur="4.83">rule is no more a law than second</text>
  <text start="671.23" dur="5.37">amendment sanctuary resolutions it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="673.42" dur="5.25">philosophy and it can also be federally</text>
  <text start="676.6" dur="4.2">preempted too because the federal when</text>
  <text start="678.67" dur="3.03">it whenever state and federal law are at</text>
  <text start="680.8" dur="3.15">odds</text>
  <text start="681.7" dur="3.81">the position of the government not the</text>

  <text start="687.07" dur="4.35">Constitution but the the actual reality</text>
  <text start="689.41" dur="4.5">that we live in because the Constitution</text>
  <text start="691.42" dur="4.29">has been gutted is that the federal law</text>
  <text start="693.91" dur="3.87">will supersede state law where they</text>
  <text start="695.71" dur="5.55">disagree so that&amp;#39;s the potential option</text>
  <text start="697.78" dur="5.43">as well and let&amp;#39;s see I want to give you</text>
  <text start="701.26" dur="7.35">guys a good definition of what the</text>
  <text start="703.21" dur="6.96">Dillion rule is and it is if there is a</text>
  <text start="708.61" dur="4.26">reasonable doubt whether legislative</text>
  <text start="710.17" dur="5.91">power exists the doubt must be resolved</text>
  <text start="712.87" dur="5.55">against the local governing body thus</text>
  <text start="716.08" dur="4.38">when a Virginia locality seeks to take</text>
  <text start="718.42" dur="4.32">any action the Dillion rule applies</text>
  <text start="720.46" dur="4.92">quote to determine in the first instance</text>
  <text start="722.74" dur="5.79">from express words or by implication</text>
  <text start="725.38" dur="5.34">whether a power exists at all if a</text>

  <text start="732.82" dur="7.23">the inquiry inquiry is at an end and the</text>
  <text start="737.47" dur="6.78">act in question is unauthorized so</text>
  <text start="740.05" dur="6.87">that&amp;#39;s a short version anyway so</text>
  <text start="744.25" dur="3.13">continuing on we are also going to talk</text>
  <text start="746.92" dur="2.86">about</text>
  <text start="747.38" dur="4.68">the Virginia Attorney General as I said</text>
  <text start="749.78" dur="4.38">earlier in the intro he says that these</text>
  <text start="752.06" dur="6.81">new gun control laws will be enforced</text>
  <text start="754.16" dur="6.81">now he is a Democrat but folks 86 of</text>
  <text start="758.87" dur="3.45">Virginia&amp;#39;s 95 counties have declared</text>
  <text start="760.97" dur="3.84">themselves a Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="762.32" dur="4.92">sanctuary that is a red state and these</text>
  <text start="764.81" dur="5.82">Democrats do not have the power to force</text>
  <text start="767.24" dur="4.38">this all they have is the state branches</text>
  <text start="770.63" dur="4.43">because of course they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="771.62" dur="7.97">cheated all the elections and such so</text>
  <text start="775.06" dur="7.14">here&amp;#39;s what would happen if in theory</text>
  <text start="779.59" dur="5.83">his threat to use the National Guard</text>
  <text start="782.2" dur="5.32">were enacted and the National Guard were</text>
  <text start="785.42" dur="5.04">to show up at these towns or cities or</text>
  <text start="787.52" dur="8.52">whatever it may be and find you know and</text>
  <text start="790.46" dur="6.93">use these these traffic stops and</text>
  <text start="796.04" dur="3.74">roadblocks and things that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="797.39" dur="4.2">trying to do to steal people&amp;#39;s guns</text>
  <text start="799.78" dur="4.63">individually because that&amp;#39;s how they do</text>
  <text start="801.59" dur="4.59">it 10 on 1 otherwise they won&amp;#39;t do it my</text>
  <text start="804.41" dur="3.51">point being and I don&amp;#39;t want violence</text>
  <text start="806.18" dur="3.9">but my point being if there is a group</text>
  <text start="807.92" dur="5.73">of Patriots with guns they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="810.08" dur="6.33">mess with you a hundred or a thousand</text>
  <text start="813.65" dur="4.5">armed reserves Minh first of all are not</text>
  <text start="816.41" dur="5.52">gonna start firing on American citizens</text>
  <text start="818.15" dur="6.84">anyway but if they did if they got a</text>
  <text start="821.93" dur="5.07">thousand Democrat gun hating national</text>
  <text start="824.99" dur="5.61">guardsmen with with automatic weapons</text>
  <text start="827" dur="5.7">and ready to fight and kill gun owners</text>
  <text start="830.6" dur="4.38">do you think trump would stand by and</text>
  <text start="832.7" dur="3.75">let that happen also do you think the</text>
  <text start="834.98" dur="2.73">rest of the country would stand by and</text>
  <text start="836.45" dur="2.76">let that happen I mean I&amp;#39;ve got people</text>
  <text start="837.71" dur="3.51">writing me saying they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="839.21" dur="4.08">Virginia from other states to stand with</text>
  <text start="841.22" dur="2.88">these Patriots folks I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="843.29" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>
  <text start="844.1" dur="4.77">and if they did it would be a atrocity</text>
  <text start="847.61" dur="2.64">that would turn the entire country</text>
  <text start="848.87" dur="2.66">against the Democrats because everyone</text>
  <text start="850.25" dur="3.42">knows they&amp;#39;re out to get the guns</text>
  <text start="851.53" dur="4.6">unconstitutionally that it&amp;#39;s unpopular</text>
  <text start="853.67" dur="4.86">and that the country&amp;#39;s unifying against</text>
  <text start="856.13" dur="5.04">them if they force the issue now they</text>
  <text start="858.53" dur="4.5">will if they spill blood they will unify</text>
  <text start="861.17" dur="7.49">this country against them and we will we</text>
  <text start="863.03" dur="8.97">will not have civil war but we will have</text>
  <text start="868.66" dur="5.83">understood the level of evil and threat</text>
  <text start="872" dur="3.66">the Democrat Party really is and holds</text>
  <text start="874.49" dur="3.39">for us they will have murdered an</text>
  <text start="875.66" dur="3.81">American citizens in their lust for</text>
  <text start="877.88" dur="2.69">power and they would have done it right</text>
  <text start="879.47" dur="2.9">out in public forever</text>
  <text start="880.57" dur="3.18">to see and I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="882.37" dur="3.93">happen I don&amp;#39;t think they have the power</text>
  <text start="883.75" dur="3.87">and certainly they have the intention</text>
  <text start="886.3" dur="3.12">and the will to do it but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="887.62" dur="4.29">have the power they don&amp;#39;t have the the</text>

  <text start="942.52" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;ve invested in stocks I did okay I</text>
  <text start="944.86" dur="4.32">didn&amp;#39;t like it I got out of stocks I was</text>

  <text start="958.54" dur="4.98">years old and I&amp;#39;m so proud of myself and</text>
  <text start="960.79" dur="4.89">I lost it all because my my mentor and</text>
  <text start="963.52" dur="3.72">my partner embezzled and stole</text>
  <text start="965.68" dur="4.38">everything and actually recently went to</text>
  <text start="967.24" dur="5.79">jail for fraud and pled guilty to this</text>
  <text start="970.06" dur="5.85">something like 36 pages have indictments</text>
  <text start="973.03" dur="4.89">or something but um you know I you know</text>
  <text start="975.91" dur="5.36">I&amp;#39;m happy that it happened I&amp;#39;m glad I</text>
  <text start="977.92" dur="5.88">lost all that money it it made me less</text>
  <text start="981.27" dur="4.39">focused on being ambitious because I</text>
  <text start="983.8" dur="4.68">wanted to escape vaccines I wanted to</text>
  <text start="985.66" dur="5.01">escape corruption and tyranny instead it</text>
  <text start="988.48" dur="3.93">made me think what do I need I just need</text>
  <text start="990.67" dur="3.21">some land and grow my own food be</text>
  <text start="992.41" dur="4.14">self-sufficient be independent that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1003.36" dur="4.98">and I ended up being a youtuber from all</text>
  <text start="1005.64" dur="4.68">of this it was a terrible experience</text>
  <text start="1008.34" dur="5.28">kind of traumatic but it ended up okay</text>
  <text start="1010.32" dur="3.91">right but my point is to kind of bring</text>
  <text start="1013.62" dur="3.52">it back I know</text>
  <text start="1014.23" dur="4.98">ranting a little bit here gold or if you</text>
  <text start="1017.14" dur="2.52">can&amp;#39;t afford gold and I sure can&amp;#39;t not</text>
  <text start="1019.21" dur="1.95">anymore</text>

  <text start="1031.03" dur="5.49">even though it doesn&amp;#39;t yield anything so</text>
  <text start="1033.1" dur="6">today it&amp;#39;s actually up over 16% for the</text>
