  <text start="4.589" dur="5.071">Mouse of Destiny most calm this is just</text>
  <text start="7.619" dur="4.711">kind of a social catch-up video I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="9.66" dur="5.219">been obviously on sort of a work</text>
  <text start="12.33" dur="4.049">vacation in North Carolina visiting</text>
  <text start="14.879" dur="4.021">family and introducing them to my new</text>
  <text start="16.379" dur="5.371">baby and then ever since I got back it</text>
  <text start="18.9" dur="5.58">was basically just moving hustle and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="21.75" dur="4.56">pretty beat but all of the heavy things</text>

  <text start="42.45" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s not really like an improvement I</text>
  <text start="46.08" dur="3.78">would say it&amp;#39;s about the same price</text>
  <text start="47.58" dur="3.66">point but it but it is an improvement in</text>
  <text start="49.86" dur="5.61">the sense it&amp;#39;s about 20 degrees cooler</text>
  <text start="51.24" dur="5.88">without AC and it&amp;#39;s downstairs so</text>
