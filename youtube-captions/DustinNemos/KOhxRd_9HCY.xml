  <text start="67.619" dur="7.921">about doing this and finally found some</text>
  <text start="69.869" dur="7.411">time so when it comes to Khashoggi what</text>
  <text start="75.54" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re portraying is it&amp;#39;s the end of</text>
  <text start="77.28" dur="5.43">the world this guy was done I guess that</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="3.78">the story has changed a few times now it</text>
  <text start="82.71" dur="5.43">looks like but this guy was killed by</text>
  <text start="84.96" dur="4.799">the Saudis and then now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="88.14" dur="3.42">screaming bloody murder the way the left</text>
  <text start="89.759" dur="4.381">does when something that they want to</text>
  <text start="91.56" dur="3.69">focus on happens whereas you know Julian</text>
  <text start="94.14" dur="4.86">Assange and hundreds of other</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="5.52">journalists they are mistreated or put</text>
  <text start="99" dur="3.39">in jail or killed and nothing really</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="5.099">ever happens no one makes a big fuss</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="4.83">about that but you know it was a little</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="4.261">suspect that they all started running</text>
  <text start="107.22" dur="5.37">with that topic but what what has gone</text>
  <text start="110.13" dur="6.449">on in your opinion from that foundation</text>
  <text start="112.59" dur="7.23">of the story to to now and the stories</text>
  <text start="116.579" dur="5.25">are changing and the your kind of</text>
  <text start="119.82" dur="3.39">thoughts on what it means like who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="121.829" dur="4.381">behind and who benefits</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="5.07">well the difference here with Khashoggi</text>
  <text start="126.21" dur="4.26">is that khashoggi is one of those and</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="4.08">when i say one of thirds he is part of</text>
  <text start="130.47" dur="3.06">the intelligence community and he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="132.36" dur="4.41">part of the intelligence</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="7.41">for a very long time and he was on the</text>
  <text start="136.77" dur="6.39">side that was prior to president Chunkin</text>
  <text start="140.94" dur="4.74">him in the office taking over the world</text>
  <text start="143.16" dur="5.07">you know kind of doing their planned of</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="4.62">jihad across you know across the world</text>
  <text start="148.23" dur="4.68">and he was one of the head contributors</text>
  <text start="150.3" dur="4.38">to making sure that that got done and a</text>
  <text start="152.91" dur="3.54">lot of what we&amp;#39;re going to find out is</text>
  <text start="154.68" dur="3.39">there are a lot of journalists that are</text>
  <text start="156.45" dur="4.89">here in the United States under that</text>
  <text start="158.07" dur="5.55">guise of journalism that are doing that</text>
  <text start="161.34" dur="5.399">exact same thing because what better way</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="4.95">to create a narrative or create what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.739" dur="4.081">going to happen in the culture but to be</text>
  <text start="168.57" dur="3.78">the person that is creating the news and</text>
  <text start="170.82" dur="4.47">putting it out there for people to</text>
  <text start="172.35" dur="5.58">believe so that was one of his main jobs</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="4.02">that he does he&amp;#39;s done ever since he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="3.3">worked with the royal family</text>
  <text start="179.31" dur="4.679">and he&amp;#39;s been there from the beginning</text>
  <text start="181.23" dur="4.02">so he knows a lot of information so he</text>
  <text start="183.989" dur="3.271">knows about 9/11</text>
  <text start="185.25" dur="3.6">he knows what really happens and what</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="3.72">he&amp;#39;s been recently doing is he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="188.85" dur="6.09">writing a lot of articles calling up</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="6.479">Israel for 9/11 and yes so that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="194.94" dur="4.35">motivation right there yeah he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.459" dur="3.901">starting to call things out and he was</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="4.59">starting to leak them in his writings</text>
  <text start="201.36" dur="5.909">and people were like oh we can&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="203.88" dur="5.73">this happening so I&amp;#39;m sure that caused</text>
  <text start="207.269" dur="4.321">them to say come visit us and then after</text>
  <text start="209.61" dur="4.05">I start thinking about it at first I</text>
  <text start="211.59" dur="4.95">thought well why is he going to Turkey</text>
  <text start="213.66" dur="5.4">when he could just go to the the embassy</text>
  <text start="216.54" dur="4.56">in Washington this is this is ridiculous</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="4.14">you know that made no sense but then I</text>
  <text start="221.1" dur="5.37">started thinking why is he even getting</text>
  <text start="223.2" dur="4.83">divorced if he&amp;#39;s Muslim yeah they can</text>
  <text start="226.47" dur="4.98">have four or five wives</text>
  <text start="228.03" dur="6.12">right you have up to four wives and um</text>
  <text start="231.45" dur="3.96">so I you know I kind of talk about these</text>
  <text start="234.15" dur="3.21">things with my husband or my daughter</text>
  <text start="235.41" dur="3.63">because they like to they do the</text>
  <text start="237.36" dur="3.75">argument thing with me like well how do</text>
  <text start="239.04" dur="4.86">you know you don&amp;#39;t know and I said well</text>
  <text start="241.11" dur="4.34">she&amp;#39;s wearing the hijab you only wear</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="3.72">that if you&amp;#39;re practicing Sharia law</text>
  <text start="245.45" dur="4">there&amp;#39;s no other reason for you to if</text>
  <text start="247.62" dur="3.27">you if you are a Muslim that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="249.45" dur="4.8">practice Sharia law you don&amp;#39;t wear these</text>
  <text start="250.89" dur="5.129">jobs so if she&amp;#39;s if she&amp;#39;s practicing</text>
  <text start="254.25" dur="6.479">that he has to practice it in order to</text>
  <text start="256.019" dur="6.291">marry her so the whole story from the</text>
  <text start="260.729" dur="4.471">very beginning when you break it down</text>
  <text start="262.31" dur="5.09">does it make sense and then I even had</text>
  <text start="265.2" dur="4.99">people say well he he&amp;#39;s just sympathetic</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="3.75">towards the Muslim Brotherhood oh come</text>
  <text start="270.19" dur="3.03">on you</text>
  <text start="271.15" dur="3.63">you&amp;#39;re not sympathetic towards them you</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="4.83">either are a part of them or you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="274.78" dur="5.43">I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s similar to I mean</text>
  <text start="278.05" dur="4.649">because it&amp;#39;s not just a religion it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="3.66">law so if you&amp;#39;re gonna be a part of the</text>
  <text start="282.699" dur="3.411">group you got to be a part of the group</text>
  <text start="283.87" dur="3.45">you can&amp;#39;t just visit yeah they&amp;#39;re safe</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="2.98">yeah</text>
  <text start="287.32" dur="7.86">they&amp;#39;ll kill you if you leave Sharia</text>
  <text start="289.09" dur="8.16">exactly and so so so his his wife was</text>
  <text start="295.18" dur="4.35">Sharia therefore he is Sharia therefore</text>
  <text start="297.25" dur="5.55">the divorce scenario becomes kind of</text>
  <text start="299.53" dur="5.72">stupid anyway doesn&amp;#39;t make sense he can</text>
  <text start="302.8" dur="6.3">just get multiple wives why I leave one</text>
  <text start="305.25" dur="7.21">so where did it go from there what have</text>
  <text start="309.1" dur="6.09">you seen sense so what I see since then</text>
  <text start="312.46" dur="6.15">is that I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think that he</text>
  <text start="315.19" dur="4.949">was kind of to thoughts on it one I</text>
  <text start="318.61" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t think he was supposed to die I</text>
  <text start="320.139" dur="3.661">think that they were just supposed to</text>
  <text start="322.27" dur="4.769">get information out of him try to make</text>
  <text start="323.8" dur="5.459">him turn to work with the new prints but</text>
  <text start="327.039" dur="5.31">he had his allegiance to the old friends</text>
  <text start="329.259" dur="5.311">and he and I think in a way because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="332.349" dur="5.581">read a couple of his writings he&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="334.57" dur="5.279">angry with United States for not calling</text>
  <text start="337.93" dur="4.59">out all of the other people that are</text>
  <text start="339.849" dur="6.211">responsible for 9/11 I mean he goes into</text>
  <text start="342.52" dur="5.49">it he he he explains why is Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="346.06" dur="3.84">taking all of the the blood for this</text>
  <text start="348.01" dur="3.39">this isn&amp;#39;t right you know I need to let</text>
  <text start="349.9" dur="4.829">everybody know we weren&amp;#39;t the only ones</text>
  <text start="351.4" dur="4.53">responsible for this and you know they</text>
  <text start="354.729" dur="5.671">then they start talking about bringing</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="9">these papers out again so with some with</text>
  <text start="360.4" dur="6.329">this his name that uh Blumenthal human</text>
  <text start="364.93" dur="4.35">thought that requested the the other</text>
  <text start="366.729" dur="3.93">thousands of documents from 9/11 that</text>
  <text start="369.28" dur="3">were supposed to come they&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="370.659" dur="4.591">to come out to him yeah I&amp;#39;m supposed to</text>
  <text start="372.28" dur="4.379">be a big release so I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="375.25" dur="4.409">they wanted him around when this when</text>
  <text start="376.659" dur="5.341">those papers were released okay so this</text>
  <text start="379.659" dur="4.38">is getting even deeper now uh-huh</text>
  <text start="382" dur="4.56">I think it&amp;#39;s right him with my story</text>
  <text start="384.039" dur="4.861">that I start it was 9/11 it was almost</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="5.099">and I didn&amp;#39;t know I was letting plan</text>
  <text start="388.9" dur="5.04">that but when I saw that&amp;#39;s what made me</text>
  <text start="391.659" dur="3.961">so interested in the case because I had</text>
  <text start="393.94" dur="3.719">already read it they out his uncle</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="4.349">because that&amp;#39;s my next phase of the</text>
  <text start="397.659" dur="3.451">story because that&amp;#39;s where his uncle</text>
  <text start="399.969" dur="3.781">comes in that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="401.11" dur="5.16">our codes and that&amp;#39;s where his his uncle</text>
  <text start="403.75" dur="4.89">did the UM the money laundering for them</text>
  <text start="406.27" dur="5.76">he had a bank contacts for them he you</text>
  <text start="408.64" dur="4.59">know he actually he did probably helped</text>
  <text start="412.03" dur="2.52">with some of the recruiting with making</text>
  <text start="413.23" dur="3.87">bombs and doing that type of thing</text>
  <text start="414.55" dur="5.4">because he was a two-pilot biological</text>
  <text start="417.1" dur="5.1">weapon warfare so I was like I knew that</text>
  <text start="419.95" dur="3.87">name I know that name and then I was</text>
  <text start="422.2" dur="3.63">like and then I realized it wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="423.82" dur="4.38">same person but that it was he was</text>
  <text start="425.83" dur="6.12">related to him and it is kind of he is</text>
  <text start="428.2" dur="7.5">he knows about it he&amp;#39;s well versed in</text>
  <text start="431.95" dur="5.34">what what happened okay birds of a</text>
  <text start="435.7" dur="5.4">feather flock together mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="437.29" dur="5.07">okay so definitely you know we knew that</text>
  <text start="441.1" dur="3.93">appearances we&amp;#39;re not going to be as</text>
  <text start="442.36" dur="4.89">simple as the official story the MSM ran</text>
  <text start="445.03" dur="6.06">with it like it was an agenda for am</text>
  <text start="447.25" dur="5.82">talking point what else have we left out</text>
  <text start="451.09" dur="7.32">is there more for the you know evidence</text>
  <text start="453.07" dur="7.98">so far I guess the only evidence here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.41" dur="5.52">the other thing I kind of was wondering</text>
  <text start="461.05" dur="5.46">why the pastors all of a sudden released</text>
  <text start="463.93" dur="4.86">so where did that come into play so I</text>
  <text start="466.51" dur="5.85">started thinking about this and I</text>
  <text start="468.79" dur="6.24">thought hmm well I know that Bernie Bois</text>
  <text start="472.36" dur="5.73">and he has just I mean he has his god</text>
  <text start="475.03" dur="5.37">complex but he wants to be the leader of</text>
  <text start="478.09" dur="4.26">the Middle East like he wants to be</text>
  <text start="480.4" dur="5.73">respected he wants to to be the leader</text>
  <text start="482.35" dur="5.34">and so this would be his way to shame</text>
  <text start="486.13" dur="2.79">the new Prince because the new Prince</text>
  <text start="487.69" dur="3.75">isn&amp;#39;t going along with the program</text>
  <text start="488.92" dur="4.74">because he wants to try the Western the</text>
  <text start="491.44" dur="4.53">ice Saudi Arabia a little bit he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="493.66" dur="4.26">interested in doing the project I think</text>
  <text start="495.97" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s called known the new city that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.92" dur="4.77">the the city with the artificial</text>
  <text start="500.62" dur="4.77">intelligence and the smart city and he</text>
  <text start="502.69" dur="3.72">wants to do all that that that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="505.39" dur="3.03">what they want to do they want to</text>
  <text start="506.41" dur="3.93">continue with the domination they want</text>
  <text start="508.42" dur="3.24">to continue with you know keeping people</text>
  <text start="510.34" dur="4.26">under their thumb they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="511.66" dur="4.17">give people independence and so so the</text>
  <text start="514.6" dur="4.56">new prince is ruining their plans</text>
  <text start="515.83" dur="6.24">there&amp;#39;s a problem so he is so I I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="519.16" dur="4.68">he&amp;#39;s saying this is great we can put</text>
  <text start="522.07" dur="3.9">something on him make him looking</text>
  <text start="523.84" dur="4.68">confident because he doesn&amp;#39;t even even</text>
  <text start="525.97" dur="5.37">if he didn&amp;#39;t call for whatever to happen</text>
  <text start="528.52" dur="4.71">happen he&amp;#39;s the prince why didn&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="531.34" dur="3.24">know it was would have happened so that</text>
  <text start="533.23" dur="5.4">makes it look what makes him</text>
  <text start="534.58" dur="7.02">the poor leader either way with if um if</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="4.38">I want him if he wants me to shut up</text>
  <text start="541.6" dur="6.179">he&amp;#39;s enough to give me some money and</text>
  <text start="543.01" dur="7.259">see turkey needs money right now so I</text>
  <text start="547.779" dur="3.99">think the motivation comes in I&amp;#39;ll shut</text>
  <text start="550.269" dur="4.171">up and I&amp;#39;ll let this case go away</text>
  <text start="551.769" dur="4.201">you need to give me some money so that</text>
  <text start="554.44" dur="2.55">we can sustain yourself for a little</text>
  <text start="555.97" dur="3.39">while to get on our feet</text>
  <text start="556.99" dur="5.51">I know that the lira has suffered pretty</text>
  <text start="559.36" dur="5.789">heavily wait Trump is doing with Turkey</text>
  <text start="562.5" dur="3.19">probably a great thing though and then</text>
  <text start="565.149" dur="2.701">in return</text>
  <text start="565.69" dur="6.18">the pastor get sent home so America</text>
  <text start="567.85" dur="7.53">satified is satisfied and that could all</text>
  <text start="571.87" dur="5.76">be together okay so on the other hand of</text>
  <text start="575.38" dur="3.899">this why is Saudi Arabia seemingly from</text>
  <text start="577.63" dur="6.019">government officials why are they kind</text>
  <text start="579.279" dur="7.591">of admitting guilt because it goes away</text>
  <text start="583.649" dur="6.101">because that didn&amp;#39;t happen to after he</text>
  <text start="586.87" dur="4.709">talked to Ergon because at first it was</text>
  <text start="589.75" dur="4.11">no we didn&amp;#39;t do it no we didn&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="591.579" dur="4.681">but then after there you know he came</text>
  <text start="593.86" dur="5.58">out into to the public that they talked</text>
  <text start="596.26" dur="6.36">all of a sudden they compromised on what</text>
  <text start="599.44" dur="4.44">he would agree to accept now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="602.62" dur="3.6">know that they actually killed him they</text>
  <text start="603.88" dur="4.35">may not have and I think that we may</text>
  <text start="606.22" dur="5.16">never know that because that will mess</text>
  <text start="608.23" dur="5.34">up the entire scenario for them but</text>
  <text start="611.38" dur="3.42">either way they&amp;#39;re gonna make it working</text>
  <text start="613.57" dur="5.28">out so that everybody gets something</text>
  <text start="614.8" dur="6">from it and then here even though that</text>
  <text start="618.85" dur="4.02">was one of theirs they they&amp;#39;re gonna use</text>
  <text start="620.8" dur="4.83">it to make Trump look like he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="622.87" dur="4.44">care about journalists which has nothing</text>
  <text start="625.63" dur="3.42">to do with that and they know that but</text>
  <text start="627.31" dur="3.99">they thought that people because they</text>
  <text start="629.05" dur="4.409">rely on when the publican to not pay</text>
  <text start="631.3" dur="4.229">attention and we don&amp;#39;t pay attention and</text>
  <text start="633.459" dur="3.901">they actually even said it on their that</text>
  <text start="635.529" dur="4.981">that&amp;#39;s why they call it the drip drip</text>
  <text start="637.36" dur="5.219">method that&amp;#39;s why they drag every all</text>
  <text start="640.51" dur="3.24">the information out so that don&amp;#39;t give</text>
  <text start="642.579" dur="2.76">you a little bit of information this</text>
  <text start="643.75" dur="4.709">week wait two weeks</text>
  <text start="645.339" dur="4.711">change the story a little bit and then</text>
  <text start="648.459" dur="4.111">two weeks more change it because people</text>
  <text start="650.05" dur="6.27">don&amp;#39;t pay attention and so by the time</text>
  <text start="652.57" dur="6.24">that they finally after they drawing it</text>
  <text start="656.32" dur="4.199">out come you know forever whatever the</text>
  <text start="658.81" dur="3.149">story is is a story but it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="660.519" dur="4.171">sense if you actually look if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="661.959" dur="4.261">been following it the whole time you</text>

  <text start="666.22" dur="3.55">doing this trip trip not</text>
  <text start="668.27" dur="3.87">that is pretty insidious too because</text>
  <text start="669.77" dur="5.12">people really do want the EZ you just</text>
  <text start="672.14" dur="5.28">like with everything else we have a easy</text>
  <text start="674.89" dur="3.7">culture fix and people just they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="677.42" dur="2.61">want to think about it too hard they</text>
  <text start="678.59" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t want to try too hard they want to</text>
  <text start="680.03" dur="5.1">get the quick fix pill or the quick fix</text>
  <text start="683.48" dur="3.48">you know synopsis or whatever the story</text>
  <text start="685.13" dur="3.99">is so I&amp;#39;m glad you&amp;#39;re able to come on</text>
  <text start="686.96" dur="3.39">and help me out with that because</text>
  <text start="689.12" dur="3.75">khashoggi you know I&amp;#39;ve been so busy</text>
  <text start="690.35" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;ve been kind of wondering what bag is</text>
  <text start="692.87" dur="4.59">going on there behind the scenes you</text>
  <text start="695.6" dur="4.14">know my instinct tells me obviously it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="697.46" dur="3.45">BS but I didn&amp;#39;t know all the details and</text>
  <text start="699.74" dur="4.35">I&amp;#39;m really glad that you were able to</text>
  <text start="700.91" dur="4.65">come on help what else do people need to</text>
  <text start="704.09" dur="3.96">know about this situation and what do</text>
  <text start="705.56" dur="4.77">you think me elite are gonna try to do</text>
  <text start="708.05" dur="4.32">with it here like you said just try to</text>
  <text start="710.33" dur="4.23">bash Trump with it but what do you think</text>
  <text start="712.37" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re gonna get out of this well I</text>
  <text start="714.56" dur="5.34">think initially they thought that they</text>
  <text start="717.53" dur="4.98">had they were going to be able to use</text>
  <text start="719.9" dur="5.34">this to their advantage to get people to</text>
  <text start="722.51" dur="6.15">sympathize with them but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="725.24" dur="5.25">they realize how long people I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="728.66" dur="4.71">think they realized the influence of</text>
  <text start="730.49" dur="4.71">this movement and that&amp;#39;s what I call it</text>
  <text start="733.37" dur="3.9">a movement because it is people that are</text>
  <text start="735.2" dur="4.28">realizing that their country has been</text>
  <text start="737.27" dur="5.25">taken over from it from the inside and</text>
  <text start="739.48" dur="5.11">now that people who are awake to it and</text>
  <text start="742.52" dur="5.67">they can see it and there&amp;#39;s no way to</text>
  <text start="744.59" dur="5.1">deny it you justyou can see it people</text>
  <text start="748.19" dur="3.81">aren&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t want to do that you</text>
  <text start="749.69" dur="4.19">know they&amp;#39;re there now more people are</text>
  <text start="752" dur="5.3">aware that I think that aren&amp;#39;t aware</text>
  <text start="753.88" dur="5.86">especially when the Trump team anyway</text>
  <text start="757.3" dur="4.54">the emperor has no clothes anymore I</text>
  <text start="759.74" dur="5.82">think right so it&amp;#39;s harder for them to</text>
  <text start="761.84" dur="5.61">get away with it yeah well I it&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="765.56" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s been my opinion the whole time the</text>
  <text start="767.45" dur="3.93">whole cute project basically the at</text>
  <text start="769.64" dur="4.47">least in the beginning was to form a</text>
  <text start="771.38" dur="6.06">group effort against an organized group</text>
  <text start="774.11" dur="4.8">effort against MSM narrative which I</text>
  <text start="777.44" dur="3.51">think we did a pretty good job of and</text>
  <text start="778.91" dur="4.11">you know meme days and you know me more</text>
  <text start="780.95" dur="5.16">everything else it it seems to be</text>
  <text start="783.02" dur="4.76">working that&amp;#39;s what forced him to move</text>
  <text start="786.11" dur="5.25">in to all of the censorship and stuff</text>
  <text start="787.78" dur="5.83">but you know what else do we need to</text>
  <text start="791.36" dur="4.62">know about khashoggi did we leave any</text>
  <text start="793.61" dur="3.63">major points out I know at one point he</text>
  <text start="795.98" dur="3.93">was supposed to be like buddies with</text>
  <text start="797.24" dur="4.219">Osama or something he was he was he was</text>
  <text start="799.91" dur="3.529">buddies with him</text>
  <text start="801.459" dur="4.591">and he was very much into all of that</text>
  <text start="803.439" dur="6.93">but instead of doing the actual fighting</text>
  <text start="806.05" dur="6.959">he took the the other way about he would</text>
  <text start="810.369" dur="4.77">report on it mm-hmm but he still was a</text>
  <text start="813.009" dur="4.86">part of it and he still was very much</text>
  <text start="815.139" dur="5.521">involved in it and he he surrounded</text>
  <text start="817.869" dur="5.07">himself around all of the princes that</text>
  <text start="820.66" dur="3.959">were in high positions and to a point</text>
  <text start="822.939" dur="4.83">where he is one of the top Saudi</text>
  <text start="824.619" dur="8.431">officials that are here to relay that</text>
  <text start="827.769" dur="7.35">information to not the he he I saw one</text>
  <text start="833.05" dur="5.069">title where it said he took the side of</text>
  <text start="835.119" dur="4.351">the wrong Prince because his allegiance</text>
  <text start="838.119" dur="3.57">is to UM</text>
  <text start="839.47" dur="4.89">I believe that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s who his</text>
  <text start="841.689" dur="4.4">allegiances to and I really want to be</text>
  <text start="844.36" dur="4.289">back in power</text>
  <text start="846.089" dur="5.47">supporting once all that money back</text>
  <text start="848.649" dur="4.081">right right yeah and I guess if he got</text>
  <text start="851.559" dur="4.171">back in power that would be one way to</text>
  <text start="852.73" dur="5.609">do it yeah I still don&amp;#39;t know why they</text>
  <text start="855.73" dur="4.769">let him out he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s like a Muslim</text>
  <text start="858.339" dur="5.071">George Soros at this and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="860.499" dur="4.981">only because of his position because</text>
  <text start="863.41" dur="4.529">he&amp;#39;s one of the hot you know the in</text>
  <text start="865.48" dur="5.639">higher order of the princes so out of</text>
  <text start="867.939" dur="5.49">out of the strange respect because they</text>
  <text start="871.119" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t have respect for many things but I</text>
  <text start="873.429" dur="5.25">think when you get to that level they</text>
  <text start="876.129" dur="5.13">tolerate a little bit more because you</text>
  <text start="878.679" dur="4.47">know too much and they don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="881.259" dur="3.33">white things you have out there what</text>
  <text start="883.149" dur="3.391">what what does they call it what</text>
  <text start="884.589" dur="5.61">insurance policies you&amp;#39;ve left behind if</text>
  <text start="886.54" dur="6.44">someone takes you out yeah okay you want</text>
  <text start="890.199" dur="6.3">to switch over to the other topic sure</text>
  <text start="892.98" dur="5.949">basically we had talked about kind of a</text>
  <text start="896.499" dur="4.68">very quick overview of some of the map</text>
  <text start="898.929" dur="4.71">which I&amp;#39;m gonna figure out a way to put</text>
  <text start="901.179" dur="3.931">that image two different images over the</text>
  <text start="903.639" dur="5.67">screen as we talk here so you guys will</text>
  <text start="905.11" dur="10.649">see that pop up but go ahead and break</text>
  <text start="909.309" dur="9.69">it down for us Sarah I have lots of</text>
  <text start="915.759" dur="6.481">books that is a big one I have probably</text>
  <text start="918.999" dur="5.13">about 10 or 12 of these um you&amp;#39;re ahead</text>
  <text start="922.24" dur="5.009">of me cuz you can see most of mine right</text>
  <text start="924.129" dur="5.76">here so yeah yeah and that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="927.249" dur="5.94">the map all of it is information on the</text>
  <text start="929.889" dur="4.131">map so what I have done with the map and</text>
  <text start="933.189" dur="2.331">I know</text>
  <text start="934.02" dur="4.89">there&amp;#39;s a little bit of controversy on</text>
  <text start="935.52" dur="6.78">what map to use I used the original map</text>
  <text start="938.91" dur="5.46">that came out very first map I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="942.3" dur="5.099">know who created it I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="944.37" dur="4.98">been recreated this is the map that I</text>
  <text start="947.399" dur="4.201">use and there are specific reasons for</text>
  <text start="949.35" dur="4.08">why I use it and I&amp;#39;m not interested in</text>
  <text start="951.6" dur="3.39">looking at the updates and not to say</text>
  <text start="953.43" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s what I want to do that they can do</text>
  <text start="954.99" dur="5.15">that this map has just worked for me and</text>
  <text start="957.81" dur="5.16">I&amp;#39;ve been able to get a lot from it and</text>
  <text start="960.14" dur="5.5">I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of work on it so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="962.97" dur="4.95">no need to keep adding to it I have</text>
  <text start="965.64" dur="4.139">enough information that when you drop</text>
  <text start="967.92" dur="3.87">something if I can&amp;#39;t find the</text>
  <text start="969.779" dur="4.201">information from an earlier post I can</text>
  <text start="971.79" dur="5.46">go to the map and I can figure out the</text>
  <text start="973.98" dur="5.46">answers from what he&amp;#39;s dropped because I</text>
  <text start="977.25" dur="9.45">have all this information yeah that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="979.44" dur="9.209">thick stack of papers where come down in</text>
  <text start="986.7" dur="4.02">the four quadrants and then I can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="988.649" dur="3.81">the summary one the third cards I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="990.72" dur="3.63">kind of give you a little breakdown of</text>
  <text start="992.459" dur="3.481">what I&amp;#39;ve done and then when you look at</text>
  <text start="994.35" dur="3.81">the map you&amp;#39;ll be able to follow what</text>
  <text start="995.94" dur="3.87">I&amp;#39;m saying exactly with it</text>
  <text start="998.16" dur="4.65">and when I say third quadrant I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="999.81" dur="4.71">know in trigonometry you have your first</text>
  <text start="1002.81" dur="3.45">quadrant your sucky quadrant your third</text>
  <text start="1004.52" dur="3.75">quadrant your fourth quadrant so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1006.26" dur="3.9">how I broke it down and then I have a</text>
  <text start="1008.27" dur="3.84">broken down in the quarters but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1010.16" dur="3.9">mainly the big reason the big waste I</text>
  <text start="1012.11" dur="4.95">have it broken down because that breaks</text>
  <text start="1014.06" dur="4.98">it down by years and kind of keeps it</text>
  <text start="1017.06" dur="4.2">together with subjects they cross over</text>
  <text start="1019.04" dur="3.989">because they&amp;#39;re gonna cross over but it</text>
  <text start="1021.26" dur="6.24">keeps it separated for me to keep it</text>
  <text start="1023.029" dur="6.3">organized yeah the third quadrant when</text>
  <text start="1027.5" dur="3.51">the map I&amp;#39;ll just go into what I have</text>
  <text start="1029.329" dur="3.781">written here because it&amp;#39;s a lot too much</text>

  <text start="1212.929" dur="4.951">asked by Q so I just use one topic I</text>
  <text start="1215.99" dur="4.11">will use illegal weapons and depleted</text>
  <text start="1217.88" dur="5.01">uranium for this example and then I go</text>
  <text start="1220.1" dur="5.34">into hell what I do Q drops do a search</text>
  <text start="1222.89" dur="3.779">on the word uranium one or you won the</text>
  <text start="1225.44" dur="3.479">search will return all the posts that</text>

  <text start="1245.24" dur="3.659">right or wrong when I&amp;#39;m collecting the</text>
  <text start="1246.679" dur="4.141">information it&amp;#39;s after I collected</text>
  <text start="1248.899" dur="6.78">because I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1250.82" dur="6.27">important when future crews yes so</text>
  <text start="1255.679" dur="2.88">something I may think that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1257.09" dur="3.75">relevant I&amp;#39;ve learned not to do that</text>
  <text start="1258.559" dur="4.261">yeah because it ends up being relevant</text>
  <text start="1260.84" dur="4.319">so I include everything even though even</text>
  <text start="1262.82" dur="3.03">if I don&amp;#39;t think it totally right I keep</text>
  <text start="1265.159" dur="2.64">it anyway</text>
  <text start="1265.85" dur="5.04">and then see what happens with it um</text>
  <text start="1267.799" dur="5.671">you&amp;#39;re an archiver like me right because</text>
  <text start="1270.89" dur="3.57">I find more than 9 maybe it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1273.47" dur="3.689">exactly right</text>
  <text start="1274.46" dur="6.81">but it was in the right direction yeah</text>
  <text start="1277.159" dur="5.851">so so it&amp;#39;s still a clue the answers from</text>
  <text start="1281.27" dur="3.509">earlier poster now play it&amp;#39;s part of the</text>
  <text start="1283.01" dur="3.299">plan to achieve our goal and so here are</text>
  <text start="1284.779" dur="4.89">the questions and answers and then I go</text>
  <text start="1286.309" dur="6.75">into every post that had anything about</text>
  <text start="1289.669" dur="5.13">uranium 1 or you want in there and so I</text>
  <text start="1293.059" dur="5.24">and then and then what you see what it</text>
  <text start="1294.799" dur="7.821">does is it gives you the entire story of</text>
  <text start="1298.299" dur="6.941">who was involved what it was who</text>
  <text start="1302.62" dur="4.15">profited from me because all of the</text>
  <text start="1305.24" dur="4.95">posts I thought they all lead it up to</text>
  <text start="1306.77" dur="6.3">they lead up to the story about how this</text>
  <text start="1310.19" dur="5.7">was happy and I&amp;#39;ll just sum it up</text>
  <text start="1313.07" dur="7.38">because it&amp;#39;s pages long but what it</text>
  <text start="1315.89" dur="7.98">shows us is that while the Russians felt</text>
  <text start="1320.45" dur="5.49">that they were manipulating us by using</text>
  <text start="1323.87" dur="5.7">taking our resources and making they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1325.94" dur="6">making themselves rich and we were more</text>
  <text start="1329.57" dur="4.95">than happy to give it to them but at the</text>
  <text start="1331.94" dur="3.68">same time there was a backdoor plan</text>
  <text start="1334.52" dur="4.44">where we were giving</text>
  <text start="1335.62" dur="5.59">uranium to Iran we were given a rhenium</text>
  <text start="1338.96" dur="5.37">to North Korea and then what we were</text>
  <text start="1341.21" dur="4.92">doing with Russia is that it was</text>
  <text start="1344.33" dur="5.49">documented what they were getting it was</text>
  <text start="1346.13" dur="7.08">documented the type of of uranium at</text>
  <text start="1349.82" dur="5.19">they were getting so in the background</text>
  <text start="1353.21" dur="3.72">Iran was said oh they&amp;#39;re never to do</text>
  <text start="1355.01" dur="3.39">anything for eight years they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1356.93" dur="3.51">doing they&amp;#39;re not developing anything</text>
  <text start="1358.4" dur="4.65">they were developing they are developing</text>
  <text start="1360.44" dur="4.35">things but in everyone&amp;#39;s mind no no</text>
  <text start="1363.05" dur="3.57">their peaceful nothing&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1364.79" dur="2.4">everything&amp;#39;s good there they would never</text>
  <text start="1366.62" dur="5.28">do that</text>
  <text start="1367.19" dur="7.44">and so what then what the plan was was</text>
  <text start="1371.9" dur="5.4">to nuke the United States once they</text>
  <text start="1374.63" dur="4.71">nuked the United States Russia gets</text>
  <text start="1377.3" dur="3.93">blamed Russia wouldn&amp;#39;t be the one that</text>
  <text start="1379.34" dur="3.39">did it but they&amp;#39;ll get blamed for it</text>
  <text start="1381.23" dur="3.48">because all the proofs will go back to</text>
  <text start="1382.73" dur="4.2">them that they were the ones that were</text>
  <text start="1384.71" dur="5.91">sold to and then we&amp;#39;re in World War 3</text>
  <text start="1386.93" dur="7.41">yeah so then they&amp;#39;re there chaos gets to</text>
  <text start="1390.62" dur="6">begin what would happen to Hillary in</text>
  <text start="1394.34" dur="3.96">that scenario well she made a lot of</text>
  <text start="1396.62" dur="4.08">money and she wasn&amp;#39;t planning on</text>
  <text start="1398.3" dur="4.71">sticking around yeah of course she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1400.7" dur="3.21">somewhere underground probably right</text>
  <text start="1403.01" dur="3.96">okay</text>
  <text start="1403.91" dur="5.25">so weak we could go for days literally</text>
  <text start="1406.97" dur="4.56">breath yeah that was just a surface that</text>
  <text start="1409.16" dur="5.04">was just a I mean there&amp;#39;s already big</text>
  <text start="1411.53" dur="6.42">nuclear attempts that has been thwarted</text>
  <text start="1414.2" dur="6.84">so and I think that&amp;#39;s what caused the</text>
  <text start="1417.95" dur="6.06">military to really wake up because after</text>
  <text start="1421.04" dur="6.54">Obama got rid of almost 200 generals and</text>
  <text start="1424.01" dur="6.3">then one 2013 when he tried to nuke</text>
  <text start="1427.58" dur="4.2">South Carolina and they wouldn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="1430.31" dur="4.35">along with it and they sent the new key</text>
  <text start="1431.78" dur="7.26">to the ocean instead of letting South</text>
  <text start="1434.66" dur="7.11">Carolina blow up he fired them and</text>
  <text start="1439.04" dur="4.82">they&amp;#39;re like no whoa whoa whoa these</text>
  <text start="1441.77" dur="4.95">guys are not playing they really want to</text>
  <text start="1443.86" dur="4.81">destroy the United States we can&amp;#39;t allow</text>
  <text start="1446.72" dur="4.38">this to happen and I think that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="1448.67" dur="5.61">they must have went to President Trump</text>
  <text start="1451.1" dur="6.03">and said we got a problem yeah okay well</text>
