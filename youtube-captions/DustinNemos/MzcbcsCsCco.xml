  <text start="116.7" dur="4.86">your support for them because they show</text>
  <text start="118.829" dur="5.881">their support for us in our first story</text>
  <text start="121.56" dur="5.519">el Han Omar had went to Africa with</text>
  <text start="124.71" dur="5.4">Nancy Pelosi and others as part of a US</text>
  <text start="127.079" dur="5.19">delegation to Ghana in order to</text>
  <text start="130.11" dur="4.53">commemorate the 400th anniversary of</text>
  <text start="132.269" dur="5.641">those who were brought here to America</text>
  <text start="134.64" dur="6.599">from Africa as slaves now of course no</text>
  <text start="137.91" dur="5.4">surprise Sheila jackson-lee was also in</text>
  <text start="141.239" dur="3.321">tow as part of this delegation of course</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="4.5">she is</text>
  <text start="144.56" dur="6.519">the one who has really been behind the</text>
  <text start="147.81" dur="5.7">push for the bill of reparations for</text>
  <text start="151.079" dur="5.431">slavery of course which at this point</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="5.13">would be very difficult to determine who</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="6.449">would actually benefit from reparations</text>
  <text start="158.64" dur="7.849">seeing how no one right now is a lie</text>
  <text start="162.959" dur="6.661">that was ever a slave or a slave owner</text>
  <text start="166.489" dur="7.72">because slavery ended a long time ago</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="9.17">so rather than address the issues that</text>
  <text start="174.209" dur="8.071">are facing Americans here right now</text>
  <text start="178.79" dur="8.91">especially regarding black Americans in</text>
  <text start="182.28" dur="9.539">inner cities they instead went to Ghana</text>
  <text start="187.7" dur="9.159">for a photo op and to talk about</text>
  <text start="191.819" dur="8.161">sustainability in that country what are</text>
  <text start="196.859" dur="9.391">you doing here for the American people</text>
  <text start="199.98" dur="9.689">nothing virtually nothing so you are</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="8.909">going to go to another country on our</text>
  <text start="209.669" dur="7.94">dime in order to number one pose for a</text>
  <text start="215.159" dur="5.36">photo op so you can look benevolent and</text>
  <text start="217.609" dur="8.08">also to talk about how you can improve</text>
  <text start="220.519" dur="7.18">another country once again showing that</text>
  <text start="225.689" dur="4.821">your loyalty is not to the American</text>
  <text start="227.699" dur="6.811">people and you do not belong in office</text>
  <text start="230.51" dur="7.18">well not just Ilhan Omar but also Nancy</text>
  <text start="234.51" dur="6.179">Pelosi constantly wasting taxpayer</text>
  <text start="237.69" dur="5.969">dollars on things that don&amp;#39;t benefit the</text>
  <text start="240.689" dur="5.13">American people for example this</text>
  <text start="243.659" dur="4.621">statement that she recently released on</text>
  <text start="245.819" dur="4.861">the 1st of August having to do with the</text>
  <text start="248.28" dur="4.62">ongoing investigations course this</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="4.32">includes all of the investigations that</text>
  <text start="252.9" dur="7.429">they had said they were going to do in</text>
  <text start="255" dur="9.57">addition to the Moller investigation</text>
  <text start="260.329" dur="6.971">which was a complete flop as far as</text>
  <text start="264.57" dur="6.719">they&amp;#39;re concerned so they are so</text>
  <text start="267.3" dur="6.959">desperate to link President Trump to</text>
  <text start="271.289" dur="4.35">some kind of crime that that is really</text>
  <text start="274.259" dur="4.44">what they&amp;#39;re focused on they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="275.639" dur="5.911">time to do anything else they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="278.699" dur="5.4">time to address the real issues in their</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="4.5">communities Nancy Pelosi and San</text>
  <text start="284.099" dur="6.81">Francisco having the highest rate of</text>
  <text start="286.05" dur="7.2">homelessness in the country they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="290.909" dur="4.361">have time for that because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="8.38">focused on</text>
  <text start="295.27" dur="9.6">trying to find president Trump guilty of</text>
  <text start="301.63" dur="5.58">anything so if we want to look at some</text>
  <text start="304.87" dur="4.41">of the updates on what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="307.21" dur="5.85">doing and what they&amp;#39;re really focused on</text>
  <text start="309.28" dur="6.3">she gives some highlights here so as far</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="7.259">as litigation she says that Jerry Nadler</text>
  <text start="315.58" dur="6.66">has taken a significant step when he</text>
  <text start="320.319" dur="4.711">filed a petition to obtain the grand</text>
  <text start="322.24" dur="7.049">jury material now this grand jury</text>
  <text start="325.03" dur="6">material really has a dual purpose one</text>
  <text start="329.289" dur="5.431">they want to get their hands on it they</text>
  <text start="331.03" dur="6">want to continue to try to keep that</text>
  <text start="334.72" dur="4.71">Russia investigation alive by claiming</text>
  <text start="337.03" dur="3.75">that there&amp;#39;s something that is hidden so</text>
  <text start="339.43" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re saying that they need to see</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="5.85">this material because something is in</text>
  <text start="343.21" dur="5.449">there that could incriminate President</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="7.83">Trump and then they could proceed with</text>
  <text start="348.659" dur="15.241">impeachment also they want to see it</text>
  <text start="354.46" dur="12.09">because there is likely some of them are</text>
  <text start="363.9" dur="6.96">implicated in that grand jury material</text>
  <text start="366.55" dur="9.6">they will likely find one of their names</text>
  <text start="370.86" dur="7.899">or more they will likely find themselves</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="5.34">within that grand jury material so</text>
  <text start="378.759" dur="6.72">they&amp;#39;re desperate to get this grand jury</text>
  <text start="381.49" dur="6.269">material has a dual purpose also in this</text>
  <text start="385.479" dur="4.891">little update she says that Elijah</text>
  <text start="387.759" dur="5.34">Cummings he is apparently quote winning</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="5.099">in court in the mizar&amp;#39;s case because</text>
  <text start="393.099" dur="4.62">he&amp;#39;s seeking the president&amp;#39;s financial</text>
  <text start="395.469" dur="4.04">statements and reports to determine if</text>
  <text start="397.719" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s financial conflicts or</text>
  <text start="399.509" dur="5.051">violations of the moments call clause</text>
  <text start="401.889" dur="5.491">which at this point we already know that</text>
  <text start="404.56" dur="5.729">he hasn&amp;#39;t violated the emoluments clause</text>
  <text start="407.38" dur="5.37">and they already stated that but they</text>
  <text start="410.289" dur="4.141">continue to try to dig and of course you</text>
  <text start="412.75" dur="6.479">know his financials has been under</text>
  <text start="414.43" dur="7.139">scrutiny for decades now because he is a</text>
  <text start="419.229" dur="4.8">successful businessman with a lot of</text>
  <text start="421.569" dur="4.38">money to audit so of course he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="424.029" dur="3.121">under audit for a long time they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="425.949" dur="2.331">found anything yet</text>
  <text start="427.15" dur="2.72">so they&amp;#39;re just trying</text>
  <text start="428.28" dur="6.17">they&amp;#39;re trying to make it look like</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="4.58">they&amp;#39;re doing something number one also</text>
  <text start="434.99" dur="8.17">they hope that they can find something</text>
  <text start="437.88" dur="7.89">in there they&amp;#39;re hoping but even so even</text>
  <text start="443.16" dur="4.229">just they know that even if they just</text>
  <text start="445.77" dur="5.88">say that they&amp;#39;re looking for these</text>
  <text start="447.389" dur="7.171">things then it gives the appearance to</text>
  <text start="451.65" dur="4.44">their followers or to the public in</text>
  <text start="454.56" dur="6.06">general that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re hoping if</text>
  <text start="456.09" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re investigating then it looks to</text>
  <text start="460.62" dur="5.52">the American people like president Trump</text>
  <text start="462.72" dur="5.64">is guilty of something think about it</text>
  <text start="466.14" dur="4.62">any time you hear about somebody who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.36" dur="4.59">under investigation immediately your</text>
  <text start="470.76" dur="4.59">mind kind of goes to the idea that this</text>
  <text start="472.95" dur="4.35">person is guilty otherwise why would</text>
  <text start="475.35" dur="3.569">they be under investigation that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="477.3" dur="5.369">they&amp;#39;re trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="478.919" dur="5.791">make it appear that he is guilty even</text>
  <text start="482.669" dur="4.831">though logical thinking would say that</text>
  <text start="484.71" dur="5.28">he&amp;#39;s not because his financials have</text>
  <text start="487.5" dur="6.419">been under scrutiny for decades and they</text>
  <text start="489.99" dur="5.79">have not found anything all right</text>
  <text start="493.919" dur="4.051">then of course she continues to run down</text>
  <text start="495.78" dur="4.44">some of the other highlights of course</text>
  <text start="497.97" dur="4.86">then they have eliot engel who is the</text>
  <text start="500.22" dur="7.009">chair of foreign affairs he&amp;#39;s continuing</text>
  <text start="502.83" dur="8.269">to investigate possible russia collusion</text>
  <text start="507.229" dur="7.81">by looking into the Trump Putin meetings</text>
  <text start="511.099" dur="5.981">they&amp;#39;re beating a dead horse and of</text>
  <text start="515.039" dur="6.69">course then she also makes a statement</text>
  <text start="517.08" dur="6.57">that if President Trump hasn&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="521.729" dur="3.571">anything that he should cooperate with</text>
  <text start="523.65" dur="5.91">all the subpoenas in order to have the</text>
  <text start="525.3" dur="7.86">opportunity to exonerate himself we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="529.56" dur="6.87">already discussed that the idea of</text>
  <text start="533.16" dur="7.02">exoneration it does not exist in real</text>
  <text start="536.43" dur="7.11">law because there&amp;#39;s a presumption of</text>
  <text start="540.18" dur="6.53">innocence the burden of proof is on the</text>
  <text start="543.54" dur="5.79">prosecution so there&amp;#39;s no such thing as</text>
  <text start="546.71" dur="6.22">exoneration it&amp;#39;s it doesn&amp;#39;t exist in</text>
  <text start="549.33" dur="6.72">real law but again they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="552.93" dur="6.24">create an illusion of guilt they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="556.05" dur="5.909">trying to fool the American people</text>
  <text start="559.17" dur="4.32">and they&amp;#39;re also wasting tax dollars so</text>
  <text start="561.959" dur="7.791">this is what they&amp;#39;re doing with their</text>
  <text start="563.49" dur="8.339">time and our money okay in other news</text>
  <text start="569.75" dur="4.18">Hollywood director Michael Moore has</text>
  <text start="571.829" dur="4.231">come out and said that America needs</text>
  <text start="573.93" dur="4.17">Michelle Obama to run for president</text>
  <text start="576.06" dur="5.25">because she is the only one apparently</text>
  <text start="578.1" dur="6.57">who can be President Trump now while I</text>
  <text start="581.31" dur="6.38">really dislike Michelle Obama he does</text>
  <text start="584.67" dur="5.49">have a point here Michelle Obama</text>
  <text start="587.69" dur="5.23">probably would have more of a chance</text>
  <text start="590.16" dur="5.19">than anyone who is running right now</text>
  <text start="592.92" dur="4.05">do I want Michelle Obama to run no if</text>
  <text start="595.35" dur="3.599">she did run would it matter</text>
  <text start="596.97" dur="4.19">no because president Trump would beat</text>
  <text start="598.949" dur="8.371">her as well</text>
  <text start="601.16" dur="8.89">we don&amp;#39;t want Obama 2.0 Obama ran this</text>
  <text start="607.32" dur="6.05">country into the ground and Hillary was</text>
  <text start="610.05" dur="7.11">going to give the nation a final blow</text>
  <text start="613.37" dur="7.3">but we the American people said no and</text>
  <text start="617.16" dur="6.72">we voted for Trump back in 2016 he won</text>
  <text start="620.67" dur="6.95">by a landslide and we are going to do it</text>
  <text start="623.88" dur="9.12">again in 2020 so even Michelle Obama</text>
  <text start="627.62" dur="8.649">would not even stand a chance because we</text>
  <text start="633" dur="5.6">refuse to let these people who hate this</text>
  <text start="636.269" dur="2.331">country</text>
  <text start="639.17" dur="9.58">into the Oval Office they will not they</text>
  <text start="644.13" dur="7.53">will not win we will not let them take</text>
  <text start="648.75" dur="6.75">this country because we are in the</text>
  <text start="651.66" dur="6.539">process of taking it back now Michael</text>
  <text start="655.5" dur="4.709">Moore also says that Michelle Obama the</text>
  <text start="658.199" dur="5.07">reason why she&amp;#39;s a better pick is</text>
  <text start="660.209" dur="5.761">because she&amp;#39;s more bold than anyone who</text>
  <text start="663.269" dur="3.841">is running right now he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="665.97" dur="4.859">they&amp;#39;re all too moderate</text>
  <text start="667.11" dur="6.539">I would have to disagree on that because</text>
  <text start="670.829" dur="4.921">for the most part with a few exceptions</text>
  <text start="673.649" dur="4.201">of course maybe Tulsi Gabbard is a</text>
  <text start="675.75" dur="5.79">little bit more centered but for the</text>
  <text start="677.85" dur="8.91">most part just about everyone who is</text>
  <text start="681.54" dur="9.37">running or really left-leaning talking</text>
  <text start="686.76" dur="7">about socialist ideals</text>

  <text start="728.65" dur="10.59">fighting your neighbor over that bread</text>
  <text start="731.05" dur="12.02">because that is how bad it is so all of</text>
  <text start="739.24" dur="5.94">these people are very left there is</text>
  <text start="743.07" dur="7.21">hardly any of them that can be</text>
  <text start="745.18" dur="8.25">classified as a moderate they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="750.28" dur="4.98">all socialists without calling</text>
  <text start="753.43" dur="4.14">themselves at the only one who is being</text>
  <text start="755.26" dur="6.17">straight up is Bernie Sanders who</text>
  <text start="757.57" dur="6.3">declares himself openly as a socialist</text>
  <text start="761.43" dur="5.32">so none of these people have a chance</text>

  <text start="774.46" dur="5.61">that is Palm Beach County of course very</text>
  <text start="777.28" dur="5.67">heavily Democratic but in desperate need</text>
  <text start="780.07" dur="6.33">of a conservative leader there for sure</text>
  <text start="782.95" dur="6.3">so the current representative Lois</text>
  <text start="786.4" dur="6.21">Frankel did not face a challenger at all</text>
  <text start="789.25" dur="6.21">in 2018 but now faces Laura Loomer as a</text>
  <text start="792.61" dur="4.8">challenger this upcoming election so</text>
  <text start="795.46" dur="4.05">hopefully we can all get behind her</text>
  <text start="797.41" dur="4.32">because I would love to see Laura Loomer</text>
  <text start="799.51" dur="8.7">take the place of Lois rankle any day</text>
  <text start="801.73" dur="8.97">now she is most noted for her work as an</text>
  <text start="808.21" dur="6.45">independent journalist and of course one</text>
  <text start="810.7" dur="6.69">of her more notable stories was when she</text>
  <text start="814.66" dur="6.27">was really hammering into the loss of</text>
  <text start="817.39" dur="6.06">Vegas story she was one of the few who</text>
  <text start="820.93" dur="3.66">was challenging the narrative and so</text>
  <text start="823.45" dur="2.64">it&amp;#39;s likely that there</text>
  <text start="824.59" dur="3.57">going to try to label her as a</text>
  <text start="826.09" dur="3.99">conspiracy theorist because of that but</text>
  <text start="828.16" dur="4.62">really that&amp;#39;s the label they give anyone</text>
  <text start="830.08" dur="6.09">who doesn&amp;#39;t push the official narrative</text>
  <text start="832.78" dur="6.72">now in addition to her work that she did</text>
  <text start="836.17" dur="6.18">on the Las Vegas shooting she also did a</text>
  <text start="839.5" dur="5.13">lot of really groundbreaking work on</text>
  <text start="842.35" dur="6.84">exposing election fraud even down here</text>
  <text start="844.63" dur="7.92">in Florida also on top of that she broke</text>
  <text start="849.19" dur="6.33">a lot of stories regarding Ilhan Omar</text>
  <text start="852.55" dur="7.47">and Rasheeda Talib and has worked</text>
  <text start="855.52" dur="8.13">tirelessly to expose Linda Sarsour who</text>
  <text start="860.02" dur="5.64">is a staunch anti-semitic and terrorist</text>
  <text start="863.65" dur="4.25">sympathizer now hopefully this will</text>
  <text start="865.66" dur="5.51">start a trend where we see more</text>
  <text start="867.9" dur="6.55">conservatives running for office</text>
  <text start="871.17" dur="7.56">challenging the incumbents challenging</text>
  <text start="874.45" dur="4.28">those who do not belong in those seats</text>
  <text start="879.09" dur="7.3">because we need more people in the</text>

  <text start="886.39" dur="8.82">going to work for us not themselves not</text>

  <text start="907.81" dur="4.77">Ratcliffe has decided to withdraw from</text>
  <text start="909.88" dur="3.9">the nomination for the Director of</text>
  <text start="912.58" dur="3.36">National Intelligence</text>
  <text start="913.78" dur="4.14">of course he says it&amp;#39;s quote to avoid</text>
  <text start="915.94" dur="5.43">months of slander and libel from fake</text>
  <text start="917.92" dur="6.09">news media and quote which is rather</text>
  <text start="921.37" dur="8.22">unfortunate but it makes sense so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="924.01" dur="9.89">likely that they were going to make that</text>
  <text start="929.59" dur="7.68">in make this into some kind of political</text>
  <text start="933.9" dur="8.32">issue where they were going to make it</text>
  <text start="937.27" dur="7.98">appear that John Ratcliffe was Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="942.22" dur="5.4">puppet so to speak and that they would</text>
  <text start="945.25" dur="8.36">say that any decision that Ratcliffe</text>
  <text start="947.62" dur="9.089">made was biased in favor of truck so</text>
  <text start="953.61" dur="5.919">President Trump is going to need to</text>
  <text start="956.709" dur="6.601">really be strategic about who he chooses</text>
  <text start="959.529" dur="5.93">for the nomination so just like he had</text>
  <text start="963.31" dur="6.6">been strategic and choosing Barr and</text>
  <text start="965.459" dur="9.25">Whitaker before him this really needs to</text>
  <text start="969.91" dur="9.59">be strategic because if the Democrats</text>
  <text start="974.709" dur="7.291">have an opportunity to make it seem like</text>
  <text start="979.5" dur="5.139">anything the Director of National</text>
  <text start="982" dur="5.99">Intelligence is illegitimate especially</text>
  <text start="984.639" dur="5.88">if it exposes them for their crimes if</text>
  <text start="987.99" dur="5.17">they can see if they can make it seem</text>
  <text start="990.519" dur="4.68">like those allegations of criminal</text>
  <text start="993.16" dur="5.69">activity is illegitimate because of a</text>
  <text start="995.199" dur="7.741">political bias they will do it</text>
  <text start="998.85" dur="4.75">so although John Ratcliffe was a good</text>
  <text start="1002.94" dur="4.28">choice</text>
  <text start="1003.6" dur="6.479">he is very qualified for the position I</text>
  <text start="1007.22" dur="5.26">think that John Ratcliffe is making a</text>
  <text start="1010.079" dur="5.76">good move by stepping back and they need</text>
  <text start="1012.48" dur="5.81">to figure out who they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="1015.839" dur="7.141">able to nominate for this position that</text>
  <text start="1018.29" dur="8.529">is not necessarily going to be assumed</text>
  <text start="1022.98" dur="7.02">to be some kind of Trump loyalist as</text>
  <text start="1026.819" dur="4.441">they like to call them because here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1030" dur="4.199">the thing the Director of National</text>
  <text start="1031.26" dur="4.949">Intelligence has oversight over all of</text>
  <text start="1034.199" dur="10.801">the intelligence agencies including FBI</text>
  <text start="1036.209" dur="13.95">and the CIA they are guilty of being</text>
  <text start="1045" dur="9.299">criminally involved in the origins of</text>
  <text start="1050.159" dur="8.551">this Russia hoax which at this point was</text>
  <text start="1054.299" dur="6.351">an attempted coup which is treason and</text>
  <text start="1058.71" dur="8.099">we&amp;#39;ve talked about this before so</text>
  <text start="1060.65" dur="8.98">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to avoid being held</text>
  <text start="1066.809" dur="4.441">accountable at whatever cost necessary</text>
  <text start="1069.63" dur="4.32">and they will find whatever angle they</text>
  <text start="1071.25" dur="6.969">can to avoid that</text>
  <text start="1073.95" dur="6.789">so I&amp;#39;ll be interested to see who will be</text>
  <text start="1078.219" dur="5.91">next for the nomination and I will be</text>
  <text start="1080.739" dur="5.851">giving updates as that comes up in other</text>
  <text start="1084.129" dur="4.65">news CBP shares an image of a child</text>
  <text start="1086.59" dur="6.389">being used by imposter parent to cross</text>
  <text start="1088.779" dur="6.75">border so they have been saying for a</text>
  <text start="1092.979" dur="4.111">while now that a significant number of</text>
  <text start="1095.529" dur="7.171">children who are coming across the</text>
  <text start="1097.09" dur="9.659">border are actually being trafficked so</text>
  <text start="1102.7" dur="6.599">they&amp;#39;re either being trafficked for the</text>
  <text start="1106.749" dur="6">intent purposes of labor and sex</text>
  <text start="1109.299" dur="7.49">trafficking or they&amp;#39;re being recycled so</text>
  <text start="1112.749" dur="7.59">recycled children are children that are</text>
  <text start="1116.789" dur="5.38">used for the purpose of enabling the</text>
  <text start="1120.339" dur="3.96">adult that&amp;#39;s escorting them to get</text>
  <text start="1122.169" dur="7.22">across the border easier that they will</text>
  <text start="1124.299" dur="7.44">be released so there is a common belief</text>
  <text start="1129.389" dur="4.48">within the countries where these people</text>
  <text start="1131.739" dur="4.711">are coming from that if you have a child</text>
  <text start="1133.869" dur="6.06">with you you&amp;#39;re not going to be detained</text>
  <text start="1136.45" dur="8.01">you will be released into the country so</text>
  <text start="1139.929" dur="6.36">what they do is they purchase these</text>
  <text start="1144.46" dur="5.339">children or you know these children are</text>
  <text start="1146.289" dur="5.34">rented out so they&amp;#39;re paid for and they</text>
  <text start="1149.799" dur="3.96">use them to cross the border and then</text>
  <text start="1151.629" dur="3.96">that child ends up being used by someone</text>
  <text start="1153.759" dur="4.59">else to do the same thing so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1155.589" dur="5.58">recycled through that system so the CBP</text>
  <text start="1158.349" dur="5.49">officers often see the same child over</text>
  <text start="1161.169" dur="7.771">and over again so now they&amp;#39;ve started</text>
  <text start="1163.839" dur="7.741">doing DNA tests on certain people so for</text>
  <text start="1168.94" dur="6.029">example this particular child the man</text>
  <text start="1171.58" dur="6.959">who had brought this child over he had</text>
  <text start="1174.969" dur="6.57">already crossed the border before and</text>
  <text start="1178.539" dur="4.8">had been sent back and so now he was</text>
  <text start="1181.539" dur="5.55">showing up again so that he was flagged</text>
  <text start="1183.339" dur="6.15">so they decided to do a DNA test on this</text>
  <text start="1187.089" dur="4.981">guy to see if he was in fact the parent</text>
  <text start="1189.489" dur="7.471">of the child and he was not so they</text>
  <text start="1192.07" dur="7.799">posted the picture and really explained</text>
  <text start="1196.96" dur="5.819">that a DNA test had determined that this</text>
  <text start="1199.869" dur="4.62">child did not belong to this adult which</text>
  <text start="1202.779" dur="4.491">is something that we have been saying</text>
  <text start="1204.489" dur="6.661">this whole time so while</text>
  <text start="1207.27" dur="6.01">Democrats love to talk about how</text>
  <text start="1211.15" dur="5.279">President Trump likes to separate</text>
  <text start="1213.28" dur="6.69">families a lot of these children in fact</text>
  <text start="1216.429" dur="7.441">the CBP says it&amp;#39;s about one in five so</text>
  <text start="1219.97" dur="6.42">20% of the children at least do not</text>
  <text start="1223.87" dur="4.62">actually belong to the adults who</text>
  <text start="1226.39" dur="7.61">they&amp;#39;re with they&amp;#39;re not related in any</text>
  <text start="1228.49" dur="5.51">kind of way so they&amp;#39;re being trafficked</text>
  <text start="1234.6" dur="9.54">so this picture was posted in order to</text>
  <text start="1238.75" dur="10.89">make that clear because it&amp;#39;s not about</text>
  <text start="1244.14" dur="8.8">separating families in fact really most</text>
  <text start="1249.64" dur="6.81">of these kids do not belong to these</text>
  <text start="1252.94" dur="8.15">Fant they are not family they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1256.45" dur="8.07">trafficking victims the border is used</text>
  <text start="1261.09" dur="7.51">for human trafficking drug trafficking</text>
  <text start="1264.52" dur="7.409">and gun trafficking it is a pipeline of</text>
  <text start="1268.6" dur="9.63">crime so these children really are</text>
  <text start="1271.929" dur="10.471">victims a lot of them so hopefully at</text>
  <text start="1278.23" dur="6.99">some point those who still believe that</text>
  <text start="1282.4" dur="4.86">President Trump is being inhumane by</text>
  <text start="1285.22" dur="5.94">separating families hopefully at some</text>
  <text start="1287.26" dur="8.22">point they will understand that there is</text>
  <text start="1291.16" dur="9.68">a crisis at the border there is a crisis</text>
  <text start="1295.48" dur="9.21">because this border has been used to</text>
  <text start="1300.84" dur="9.28">violates human rights and not on the</text>
  <text start="1304.69" dur="9.63">part of President Trump all right in</text>
  <text start="1310.12" dur="6.21">other news Trump says North Korea&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1314.32" dur="4.979">three short-range missile tests are not</text>
  <text start="1316.33" dur="4.61">a violation of Singapore agreement so of</text>
  <text start="1319.299" dur="4.951">course they have had some recent</text>
  <text start="1320.94" dur="5.65">short-range missile tests and the</text>
  <text start="1324.25" dur="5.79">mainstream news is all over it saying</text>

  <text start="1330.04" dur="7.08">that they are becoming more of a threat</text>
  <text start="1332.59" dur="6.87">now now President Trump has said that</text>
  <text start="1337.12" dur="4.8">the goal of course is denuclearization</text>
  <text start="1339.46" dur="3.99">of North Korea which of course is going</text>
  <text start="1341.92" dur="4.23">to take a while it&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="1343.45" dur="5.37">overnight at the same time he said that</text>
  <text start="1346.15" dur="8.25">when it comes to short-range missile</text>
  <text start="1348.82" dur="10.41">tests it&amp;#39;s pretty standard which is very</text>
  <text start="1354.4" dur="10.13">likely the case because overall in</text>
  <text start="1359.23" dur="11.1">general countries do have to maintain</text>
  <text start="1364.53" dur="8.02">some type of military defence system so</text>
  <text start="1370.33" dur="7.08">that&amp;#39;s why we do drills that&amp;#39;s why we do</text>

  <text start="1377.41" dur="7.77">the event that there is a threats we are</text>
  <text start="1380.38" dur="6.75">ready so it&amp;#39;s likely that the</text>

  <text start="1387.13" dur="7.95">standard procedure regarding military</text>
  <text start="1391.42" dur="6.86">readiness now of course</text>
  <text start="1395.08" dur="5.78">North Korea had recently come out and</text>
  <text start="1398.28" dur="6.55">made it clear that they were not happy</text>
  <text start="1400.86" dur="8.26">with the fact that we are set to have</text>
  <text start="1404.83" dur="5.97">drills with South Korea and it&amp;#39;s likely</text>
  <text start="1409.12" dur="4.98">that they came out and made those</text>
  <text start="1410.8" dur="6">statements because they could have China</text>
  <text start="1414.1" dur="7.65">in their ear at this point because of</text>
  <text start="1416.8" dur="10.95">course China and North Korea have a very</text>
  <text start="1421.75" dur="8.58">tight trade relationship and at this</text>
  <text start="1427.75" dur="5.55">point China is definitely feeling the</text>
  <text start="1430.33" dur="6.57">squeeze when it comes to the tariffs</text>
  <text start="1433.3" dur="6.12">that we have slapped on them and of</text>
  <text start="1436.9" dur="5.55">course President Trump has recently come</text>
  <text start="1439.42" dur="7.55">out and said that now there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1442.45" dur="8.31">be an increase of about 300 billion so</text>
  <text start="1446.97" dur="5.56">China now is likely going to try to</text>

  <text start="1454.48" dur="6.81">to but they&amp;#39;ve been unsuccessful so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1458.74" dur="5.88">possible that now they&amp;#39;re going to try</text>
  <text start="1461.29" dur="6.21">to counter this indirectly by trying to</text>
