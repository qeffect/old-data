  <text start="123.469" dur="4.231">their support for us our first story</text>
  <text start="125.689" dur="4.29">comes out at the gateway pendant a labor</text>
  <text start="127.7" dur="5.22">secretary cost the resigning amid</text>
  <text start="129.979" dur="5.401">Epstein field blowback so of course</text>
  <text start="132.92" dur="6.3">there have been calls recently for labor</text>
  <text start="135.38" dur="7.47">secretary Alex Acosta to resign because</text>
  <text start="139.22" dur="5.61">of his involvement in the plea deal the</text>
  <text start="142.85" dur="5.16">controversial plea deal that was struck</text>
  <text start="144.83" dur="4.57">back in 2008 in the original epstein</text>
  <text start="148.01" dur="5.149">case</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="4.66">now President Trump did not call for his</text>
  <text start="153.159" dur="3.901">resignation</text>
  <text start="154.06" dur="5.299">however Alex Acosta did decide that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="157.06" dur="6.42">probably best for him to step down</text>
  <text start="159.359" dur="7.571">because he doesn&amp;#39;t want to be distracted</text>
  <text start="163.48" dur="5.67">from what his job actually is as the</text>
  <text start="166.93" dur="4.47">Labor Secretary he doesn&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="169.15" dur="4.259">Epstein case to be a distraction from</text>
  <text start="171.4" dur="4.11">that so he has decided that it&amp;#39;s better</text>
  <text start="173.409" dur="6.3">for him to just step aside at this time</text>
  <text start="175.51" dur="7.229">now I will say that it&amp;#39;s probably a good</text>
  <text start="179.709" dur="5.191">idea that he resigns just because if</text>
  <text start="182.739" dur="7.771">they&amp;#39;re gonna try and really hash out</text>
  <text start="184.9" dur="10.979">this case in a way that is clean than</text>
  <text start="190.51" dur="7.83">they needed to have him not be in a</text>
  <text start="195.879" dur="5.31">political position he did not need to be</text>
  <text start="198.34" dur="5.819">part of the administration because then</text>
  <text start="201.189" dur="6.45">they can turn this case into a political</text>
  <text start="204.159" dur="7.41">ordeal and so to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="207.639" dur="7.59">political aspect of it then Alex Acosta</text>
  <text start="211.569" dur="6.57">needed to step aside not because he was</text>
  <text start="215.229" dur="5.75">the one who made the original plea</text>
  <text start="218.139" dur="5.22">bargain because he was not that is a</text>
  <text start="220.979" dur="3.85">misconception at this point and of</text>
  <text start="223.359" dur="5.22">course he did make a public statement</text>
  <text start="224.829" dur="10.731">recently and he did say that while he</text>
  <text start="228.579" dur="12.24">was fighting to get a more stricter</text>
  <text start="235.56" dur="7.929">sentence the state prosecutors who had</text>
  <text start="240.819" dur="6.75">been working on the case prior to him</text>
  <text start="243.489" dur="7.86">him being involved had actually wanted</text>
  <text start="247.569" dur="5.971">to let him off entirely where Epstein</text>
  <text start="251.349" dur="5.04">would have walked he would not have</text>
  <text start="253.54" dur="5.55">served prison time at all he would not</text>
  <text start="256.389" dur="4.59">have even had to register as a sex</text>
  <text start="259.09" dur="4.949">offender at all there would have been no</text>
  <text start="260.979" dur="5.041">consequences so then Alex Acosta had</text>
  <text start="264.039" dur="4.981">come in and he had been working on the</text>
  <text start="266.02" dur="9.78">case for two years and even had a 58</text>
  <text start="269.02" dur="10.949">page indictment however at that point</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="6.32">then others were brought in and they</text>
  <text start="279.969" dur="8.351">were the ones who came down on him in</text>
  <text start="282.12" dur="8.519">said to back off they were the ones who</text>
  <text start="288.32" dur="5.8">negotiated the deal that Epstein had</text>
  <text start="290.639" dur="6.421">gone it was not Alex Acosta Alex Acosta</text>
  <text start="294.12" dur="5.88">was one of several members who were</text>
  <text start="297.06" dur="5.579">involved in this case but there again</text>
  <text start="300" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re focusing on him because of his</text>
  <text start="302.639" dur="4.471">ties with President Trump cuz obviously</text>
  <text start="304.38" dur="5.37">he was appointed by President Donald</text>
  <text start="307.11" dur="4.619">Trump so any way that they can try to</text>
  <text start="309.75" dur="4.08">link President Trump to this case</text>
  <text start="311.729" dur="4.801">they&amp;#39;re going to do it same thing with</text>
  <text start="313.83" dur="4.44">the little black book they tried to link</text>
  <text start="316.53" dur="3.84">President Trump just because you know</text>
  <text start="318.27" dur="2.79">his contact information was in this</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="4.26">black book</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="6.24">well you know I would like in that black</text>
  <text start="324.63" dur="5.34">book to you know today&amp;#39;s Facebook so</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="5.13">Facebook you may have several people who</text>
  <text start="329.97" dur="5.04">are you know quote-unquote friends on</text>
  <text start="332.43" dur="5.13">your facebook however that does not mean</text>
  <text start="335.01" dur="4.35">necessarily that you are the closest of</text>
  <text start="337.56" dur="4.229">friends with them and that you associate</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="4.679">with them all the time it means that</text>
  <text start="341.789" dur="6.44">maybe perhaps you might have brushed</text>
  <text start="344.039" dur="9.181">elbows with them a few times maybe on a</text>
  <text start="348.229" dur="7.241">very superficial social level so they</text>
  <text start="353.22" dur="5.22">have not been able to link President</text>
  <text start="355.47" dur="5.069">Trump to Epstein on more than a</text>
  <text start="358.44" dur="5.67">superficial social level and that is</text>
  <text start="360.539" dur="5.791">what so Alex Acosta was someone who they</text>
  <text start="364.11" dur="5.48">were going to try to use to get Trump</text>
  <text start="366.33" dur="6.57">roped into this but it is not working</text>
  <text start="369.59" dur="5.5">but regardless he needs to step aside in</text>
  <text start="372.9" dur="4.5">order to take out that political</text>
  <text start="375.09" dur="8.609">component so that they can just focus on</text>
  <text start="377.4" dur="8.82">this case okay also related to this</text>
  <text start="383.699" dur="4.761">Chris Cuomo has come out and made a</text>
  <text start="386.22" dur="4.86">statement that he says we should not</text>
  <text start="388.46" dur="6.22">necessarily focus on who Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="5.91">friends are because apparently he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.68" dur="4.35">saying that it&amp;#39;s not that important so</text>
  <text start="396.99" dur="3.6">let&amp;#39;s take a look at what he said is it</text>
  <text start="399.03" dur="3.48">quote when we&amp;#39;re talking about Epstein</text>
  <text start="400.59" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;ve got to stick to what is common</text>
  <text start="402.51" dur="3.96">sense on these things all right don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="404.19" dur="3.84">get buried in legalese don&amp;#39;t follow the</text>
  <text start="406.47" dur="3.449">finger-pointing and please don&amp;#39;t get up</text>
  <text start="408.03" dur="4.379">on the intrigue of who is better friends</text>
  <text start="409.919" dur="4.171">with this guy who cares let&amp;#39;s take a</text>
  <text start="412.409" dur="2.991">look at the facts of what we know about</text>
  <text start="414.09" dur="3.35">how it was handled</text>
  <text start="415.4" dur="3.72">okay we are going to dissect them with</text>
  <text start="417.44" dur="4.05">one of the best investigators around</text>
  <text start="419.12" dur="3.98">what was done that seems fine and what</text>
  <text start="421.49" dur="7.41">was Fugazi end quote</text>
  <text start="423.1" dur="9.76">alright so the problem with this is is</text>
  <text start="428.9" dur="7.53">that the original case did involve</text>
  <text start="432.86" dur="6.179">others who were connected with Epstein</text>
  <text start="436.43" dur="5.579">and who were involved in this sex truck</text>
  <text start="439.039" dur="5.88">trafficking operation it was not just</text>
  <text start="442.009" dur="5.22">Epstein even from the very beginning so</text>
  <text start="444.919" dur="4.921">the fact that he&amp;#39;s trying to discount</text>
  <text start="447.229" dur="5.19">you know the importance of finding out</text>
  <text start="449.84" dur="5.76">who these associates are really raises a</text>
  <text start="452.419" dur="4.141">red flag as to why he would say</text>
  <text start="455.6" dur="3.06">something like this</text>
  <text start="456.56" dur="4.139">I don&amp;#39;t know Chris Cole are you afraid</text>
  <text start="458.66" dur="4.74">that maybe your name might come up on</text>
  <text start="460.699" dur="6">this are you related to this somehow</text>
  <text start="463.4" dur="5.91">were you benefiting from some kind of</text>
  <text start="466.699" dur="5.9">relationship with Epstein in regards to</text>
  <text start="469.31" dur="6.479">underage girls maybe I don&amp;#39;t know but</text>
  <text start="472.599" dur="8.591">the fact of the matter is is if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="475.789" dur="7.711">going to really bring justice regarding</text>
  <text start="481.19" dur="4.59">this case then we need to look at</text>
  <text start="483.5" dur="4.44">everything because it was not just</text>
  <text start="485.78" dur="6.69">Epstein and that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="487.94" dur="7.979">charged with sex trafficking he was</text>
  <text start="492.47" dur="7.29">involved in an international sex</text>
  <text start="495.919" dur="8.28">trafficking operation that involved</text>
  <text start="499.76" dur="8.27">minors so everyone who is involved in</text>
  <text start="504.199" dur="6.96">this needs to be held accountable</text>
  <text start="508.03" dur="6.04">therefore it is important to know who</text>
  <text start="511.159" dur="7.25">his close associates were and who was</text>
  <text start="514.07" dur="7.38">benefiting from this for example</text>
  <text start="518.409" dur="8.501">President Bill Clinton former President</text>
  <text start="521.45" dur="7.889">Bill Clinton and apparently according to</text>
  <text start="526.91" dur="4.53">court documents when Jeffrey Epstein was</text>
  <text start="529.339" dur="4.231">recently asked if he personally knew</text>
  <text start="531.44" dur="4.73">President Bill Clinton he decided to</text>
  <text start="533.57" dur="2.6">plead the fifth</text>
  <text start="536.83" dur="5.59">which is likely because he&amp;#39;s afraid of</text>
  <text start="539.959" dur="4.291">something happening to him if he does</text>
  <text start="542.42" dur="5.4">give up that information</text>
  <text start="544.25" dur="6.78">in other news yesterday there was a</text>
  <text start="547.82" dur="7.08">hearing on migrant children and the</text>
  <text start="551.03" dur="6.45">border and representative Alexandria</text>
  <text start="554.9" dur="6.45">Cascio Cortez decided that she was going</text>
  <text start="557.48" dur="7.44">to try to make for our ice director</text>
  <text start="561.35" dur="5.91">common look bad but it didn&amp;#39;t exactly</text>
  <text start="564.92" dur="6.21">turn out the way that she wanted let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.26" dur="7.77">take a look at this it&amp;#39;s a source of it</text>
  <text start="571.13" dur="6.02">and it seems as though mr. Holman that</text>
  <text start="575.03" dur="7.49">you are the author</text>
  <text start="577.15" dur="9.52">it says here from yourself</text>
  <text start="582.52" dur="7.98">Kevin McHale Eamonn and Francis Cissna</text>
  <text start="586.67" dur="3.83">is this correct did you sign the memo</text>
  <text start="592.15" dur="9.49">I&amp;#39;d be happy to provide it but I would</text>
  <text start="599.6" dur="4.65">like to note that here it says the</text>
  <text start="601.64" dur="5.18">official recommendation there were three</text>
  <text start="604.25" dur="4.62">different options presented the third</text>
  <text start="606.82" dur="4.48">included the option for family</text>
  <text start="608.87" dur="4.68">separation this initiative would pursue</text>
  <text start="611.3" dur="3.81">prosecution of all amenable adults</text>
  <text start="613.55" dur="5.91">including those presenting with the</text>
  <text start="615.11" dur="8.22">family unit mr. Holman your name is on</text>
  <text start="619.46" dur="5.88">this as is correct yes I am oh so you</text>
  <text start="623.33" dur="4.71">are the author of the family separation</text>
  <text start="625.34" dur="6.27">policy although you&amp;#39;re not the author</text>
  <text start="628.04" dur="4.11">but you signed the memo yes tolerance</text>
  <text start="631.61" dur="3.45">memo</text>
  <text start="632.15" dur="5.1">so you provided the official</text>
  <text start="635.06" dur="4.08">recommendation to secretary Nielsen on</text>

  <text start="642.38" dur="4.2">recommendations on how to secure the</text>
  <text start="644.36" dur="3.78">border and save lives but it says here</text>
  <text start="646.58" dur="3.63">that you ret you gave her numerous</text>
  <text start="648.14" dur="4.17">options but the recommendation was</text>
  <text start="650.21" dur="4.56">option three family separation I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="652.31" dur="4.65">saying this is not the only paper where</text>

  <text start="662.51" dur="3.83">you recommended you recommended family</text>
  <text start="664.37" dur="4.59">separation I recommend a zero tolerance</text>

  <text start="676.449" dur="5.351">zero tolerance was interpreted as the</text>

  <text start="739.699" dur="12.351">an American citizen is caught driving</text>
  <text start="744.97" dur="9.969">under the influence then they are not</text>
  <text start="752.05" dur="4.75">exempt from being arrested on the spot</text>
  <text start="754.939" dur="3.75">just because they may have children in</text>
  <text start="756.8" dur="4.44">the backseat of the car no they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="758.689" dur="5.371">actually going to still arrest that</text>

  <text start="764.06" dur="6.12">someone else to come and get the kids</text>
  <text start="765.97" dur="6.729">family separation because of a crime</text>

  <text start="772.699" dur="5.7">you does not make you immune from these</text>
  <text start="776.18" dur="4.29">consequences and so that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="778.399" dur="4.141">he&amp;#39;s saying here and you know if someone</text>
  <text start="780.47" dur="3.929">is coming here and they&amp;#39;re wanting to</text>
  <text start="782.54" dur="3.87">claim asylum then they have to go</text>
  <text start="784.399" dur="7.321">through the ports of entry so that they</text>
  <text start="786.41" dur="7.409">can be processed for that claim but you</text>
  <text start="791.72" dur="4.5">cannot just cross into this country</text>
  <text start="793.819" dur="6.27">illegally and think that you can just</text>
  <text start="796.22" dur="6.469">get away with it that is not a secure</text>

  <text start="802.689" dur="7.33">zero-tolerance policy means that yes</text>
  <text start="806.63" dur="4.709">if a family units is crossing the border</text>
  <text start="810.019" dur="3.541">illegally then they will be separated</text>

  <text start="815.42" dur="11.46">to be processed as such okay</text>
  <text start="823.509" dur="6.491">also in related news this is coming from</text>
  <text start="826.88" dur="5.3">the gateway pendant so there were</text>

  <text start="845.959" dur="5.07">a lot of them are run by private prisons</text>
  <text start="849.139" dur="4.471">and we talked about this before and the</text>

  <text start="881.389" dur="2.911">painted on it abolish ice and then they</text>
  <text start="883.67" dur="3.019">raised it again</text>
  <text start="884.3" dur="5.519">upside down and then some other</text>
  <text start="886.689" dur="6.731">unrecognizable flag but it&amp;#39;s very</text>

  <text start="896.66" dur="6.299">all you know is it&amp;#39;s very reminiscent of</text>
  <text start="899.48" dur="11.159">when you know migrants who were trying</text>
  <text start="902.959" dur="10.671">to cross the border they were coming in</text>

  <text start="944.68" dur="4.56">Mexico is so terrible where these people</text>
  <text start="947.11" dur="3.78">are coming from Mexico also if it&amp;#39;s so</text>

  <text start="950.89" dur="3.27">so much that you have to leave there in</text>
  <text start="952.3" dur="9.06">order to come here why are you raising</text>
  <text start="954.16" dur="9.9">the Mexican flag so this is where their</text>
  <text start="961.36" dur="5.07">loyalties lie with these countries that</text>
  <text start="964.06" dur="4.23">they say they&amp;#39;re supposedly fleeing and</text>

  <text start="970.51" dur="6.99">facilities they hate this country</text>
  <text start="974.41" dur="8.85">and that is why they&amp;#39;re also proponents</text>
  <text start="977.5" dur="9.51">for open borders most of the people who</text>
  <text start="983.26" dur="6.75">are advocates for open borders are</text>
  <text start="987.01" dur="6.18">people who hate this country and this is</text>
  <text start="990.01" dur="8.15">just another incident that totally</text>
  <text start="993.19" dur="7.74">demonstrates that fact in related news</text>

  <text start="1049.05" dur="7.2">adults at some point that is the goal</text>
  <text start="1051.27" dur="9.24">for them so while they have again while</text>
  <text start="1056.25" dur="8.55">they have so many California residents</text>
  <text start="1060.51" dur="5.23">citizens who are in poverty who are</text>
  <text start="1064.8" dur="4.27">homeless</text>

  <text start="1072.46" dur="8.01">at San Francisco look at Los Angeles so</text>
  <text start="1076.36" dur="9.06">they don&amp;#39;t have the resources to address</text>

  <text start="1091.6" dur="9.06">immigrants this is not okay</text>
  <text start="1097.41" dur="4.96">this should be an outrage to people who</text>
  <text start="1100.66" dur="4.98">live in California because you know</text>
  <text start="1102.37" dur="6.93">they&amp;#39;re making people outside of this</text>
  <text start="1105.64" dur="6.15">country a priority American citizens</text>
  <text start="1109.3" dur="7.08">should be a priority if you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1111.79" dur="8.34">money to assist with the growing crisis</text>
  <text start="1116.38" dur="6.42">of homeless Americans then you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1120.13" dur="6.179">have money to pay for healthcare for</text>
  <text start="1122.8" dur="7.2">illegals point-blank that is my opinion</text>
  <text start="1126.309" dur="5.701">on that so but again California has</text>
  <text start="1130" dur="6.62">proven time and time again they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1132.01" dur="12.2">care about Americans they care about</text>
  <text start="1136.62" dur="11.559">these Eagles more now I know when</text>
  <text start="1144.21" dur="6.13">President Trump had said a while while</text>
  <text start="1148.179" dur="5.641">back that he was going to cut funding</text>
  <text start="1150.34" dur="4.86">for sanctuary cities sanctuary cities</text>
  <text start="1153.82" dur="4.32">were not going to be eligible for</text>
  <text start="1155.2" dur="6.9">federal funding now that was shot down</text>
  <text start="1158.14" dur="6.89">however there is a small portion of</text>
  <text start="1162.1" dur="5.52">funding that will not be available to</text>
  <text start="1165.03" dur="6.19">sanctuary cities and that has to do with</text>
  <text start="1167.62" dur="8.22">community policing so a federal appeals</text>
  <text start="1171.22" dur="6.9">court has upheld the decision that there</text>
  <text start="1175.84" dur="4.11">can be front preferential treatment</text>
  <text start="1178.12" dur="8.18">given to</text>
  <text start="1179.95" dur="9.69">cities that are abiding by federal laws</text>
  <text start="1186.3" dur="6">when it comes to ice and things like</text>
  <text start="1189.64" dur="6.15">that so this has to do only with</text>
  <text start="1192.3" dur="7.27">community policing grants and so those</text>
  <text start="1195.79" dur="6.09">who are cooperating with ice those are</text>
  <text start="1199.57" dur="4.41">the cities that can benefit from these</text>
  <text start="1201.88" dur="4.95">grants which you know makes sense</text>
  <text start="1203.98" dur="6.09">because if you&amp;#39;re not following the law</text>
  <text start="1206.83" dur="6.54">then you should not be able to benefit</text>
  <text start="1210.07" dur="5.85">from a law enforcement grant because a</text>
  <text start="1213.37" dur="6.33">law enforcement grant is is meant to</text>
  <text start="1215.92" dur="6.21">boost your ability to follow those laws</text>
  <text start="1219.7" dur="5.01">to enforce those laws right so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1222.13" dur="5.91">not if you&amp;#39;re blatantly saying hey I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1224.71" dur="6.96">not gonna enforce any of these laws then</text>
  <text start="1228.04" dur="7.25">you you&amp;#39;re not entitled to federal</text>
  <text start="1231.67" dur="9.99">grants that focus on law enforcement</text>
  <text start="1235.29" dur="9.52">right so this is a good thing all right</text>
  <text start="1241.66" dur="5.43">in other news the Moller testimony has</text>
  <text start="1244.81" dur="5.04">been delayed it was originally set for</text>
  <text start="1247.09" dur="5.64">July 17th now he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>

  <text start="1252.73" dur="3.99">he&amp;#39;s going to be testifying before the</text>

  <text start="1271.24" dur="6.24">lawmakers get to question Moeller for a</text>
  <text start="1274.84" dur="5.55">longer period of time which really</text>
  <text start="1277.48" dur="5.19">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense because now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1280.39" dur="6.69">known that most of these lawmakers have</text>
  <text start="1282.67" dur="7.41">not even read the Muller report how can</text>
  <text start="1287.08" dur="5.7">you question someone about something you</text>
  <text start="1290.08" dur="4.71">know nothing about where are you going</text>
  <text start="1292.78" dur="3.87">to get your questions if you have not</text>
  <text start="1294.79" dur="3.87">even read this document because the</text>

  <text start="1298.66" dur="5.61">document that you have not even read so</text>
  <text start="1301.59" dur="4.81">to me it would seem as though you know</text>
  <text start="1304.27" dur="3.84">they need this expansion so that what</text>
  <text start="1306.4" dur="3.78">they can sit there during the hearing</text>
  <text start="1308.11" dur="4.2">and read the reports</text>
  <text start="1310.18" dur="5.55">during the hearing before they asked the</text>
  <text start="1312.31" dur="5.82">questions really that&amp;#39;s what they should</text>
  <text start="1315.73" dur="4.62">be doing they should read the report but</text>
  <text start="1318.13" dur="5.67">they don&amp;#39;t want to because they already</text>
  <text start="1320.35" dur="9.54">know what&amp;#39;s in the report they know that</text>
  <text start="1323.8" dur="10.11">this whole thing was a sham so really</text>
  <text start="1329.89" dur="7.56">this lengthened testimony this dragging</text>
  <text start="1333.91" dur="6.15">out of this whole thing is then just</text>
  <text start="1337.45" dur="4.74">digging their hole deeper and deeper and</text>
  <text start="1340.06" dur="4.2">deeper so you know again at this point</text>
  <text start="1342.19" dur="4.02">we never want to interfere with the</text>
  <text start="1344.26" dur="4.23">enemy when they&amp;#39;re destroying themselves</text>
  <text start="1346.21" dur="9.26">and of course this is going to be public</text>
  <text start="1348.49" dur="10.2">so this should be very interesting in</text>
  <text start="1355.47" dur="6.06">other good news so this has to do with</text>

  <text start="1403.96" dur="5.97">disaster aid was handled by the people</text>
  <text start="1407.53" dur="5.01">at the top was very inappropriate</text>
  <text start="1409.93" dur="5.1">they misappropriated these funds they</text>
  <text start="1412.54" dur="4.95">abused these funds and then they turned</text>
  <text start="1415.03" dur="4.26">it into a political stint where they</text>
  <text start="1417.49" dur="5.73">tried to make President Trump look bad</text>

  <text start="1605.9" dur="4.05">that they were racist to the world they</text>

  <text start="1609.95" dur="6.45">store where they could announce that</text>
  <text start="1611.78" dur="8.7">they&amp;#39;re stupid too so apparently this</text>
  <text start="1616.4" dur="8.46">event was about safe spaces for trans</text>

  <text start="1635.11" dur="6.07">what&amp;#39;s the majority in there like</text>
  <text start="1637.46" dur="6.93">implying that because whites are the</text>

  <text start="1644.39" dur="3.86">that&amp;#39;s a bad thing and that&amp;#39;s oppressive</text>
  <text start="1648.34" dur="7.84">now here&amp;#39;s the thing they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1652.4" dur="8.94">about safe spaces they want safe spaces</text>
  <text start="1656.18" dur="8.76">this is a hostile environment in general</text>
  <text start="1661.34" dur="5.4">so they&amp;#39;re wanting to push for safe</text>
  <text start="1664.94" dur="4.71">spaces but they&amp;#39;re making a hostile</text>
  <text start="1666.74" dur="4.86">environment for everyone else so that</text>
  <text start="1669.65" dur="4.08">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense also they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1671.6" dur="4.05">talking they&amp;#39;re chanting about you know</text>

  <text start="1684.71" dur="6.06">to make it okay to exclude whites and of</text>
  <text start="1688.1" dur="5.85">course in you know recent years there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1690.77" dur="6.659">been this idea that you know racism</text>
  <text start="1693.95" dur="5.099">against White&amp;#39;s does not exist you know</text>
  <text start="1697.429" dur="3.361">some people would even call it reverse</text>
  <text start="1699.049" dur="3.301">racism you know if they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1700.79" dur="4.35">talk about racism against White&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="1702.35" dur="5.13">call it reverse racism even that is a</text>
  <text start="1705.14" dur="6.63">misconception because the definition of</text>
  <text start="1707.48" dur="8.1">racism is discrimination against a</text>
  <text start="1711.77" dur="5.97">person based on their rates that is the</text>
  <text start="1715.58" dur="5.01">definition so if they are discriminated</text>
  <text start="1717.74" dur="6.15">against a group because that they are</text>
  <text start="1720.59" dur="5.579">white then that is racism there that is</text>
  <text start="1723.89" dur="6">not reverse racism and of course you</text>
  <text start="1726.169" dur="6.301">know then there are those that say it</text>
  <text start="1729.89" dur="6.5">can&amp;#39;t exist racism against White&amp;#39;s does</text>
  <text start="1732.47" dur="8.04">not exist that is a complete fabrication</text>
  <text start="1736.39" dur="7.3">they demonstrate day after day at events</text>
  <text start="1740.51" dur="7.44">like this that racism against White&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1743.69" dur="8.479">exist and of course also you know sexism</text>
  <text start="1747.95" dur="9.15">against males you know they they want to</text>
  <text start="1752.169" dur="5.831">promote this idea that being white is</text>
  <text start="1757.1" dur="5.16">shameful</text>
  <text start="1758" dur="6.72">being male is shameful that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1762.26" dur="6.18">supposed to feel guilty somehow because</text>
  <text start="1764.72" dur="5.88">you&amp;#39;re white or male and you know heaven</text>
  <text start="1768.44" dur="6.66">forbid if you&amp;#39;re both then you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1770.6" dur="9.75">screwed all around but this is not okay</text>
  <text start="1775.1" dur="6.87">so you know essentially they&amp;#39;re calling</text>
  <text start="1780.35" dur="3.24">for safe spaces while making an</text>
  <text start="1781.97" dur="3.42">environment hostile they wouldn&amp;#39;t even</text>

  <text start="1796.49" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re making this big scene because</text>
  <text start="1798.5" dur="6.09">they want safe spaces well you can make</text>

  <text start="1844.77" dur="9.78">pushing the issue it&amp;#39;s becoming like a</text>
  <text start="1847.59" dur="8.7">manifest reality in other news this is</text>
  <text start="1854.55" dur="4.08">coming out of the associative Free Press</text>
  <text start="1856.29" dur="4.98">New Zealanders give up weapons after</text>
  <text start="1858.63" dur="4.68">mass killings now this is something that</text>
  <text start="1861.27" dur="5.03">was hinted at before that was going to</text>
  <text start="1863.31" dur="6.15">happen and now it is coming to pass so</text>
  <text start="1866.3" dur="7.38">New Zealanders are handing over their</text>
  <text start="1869.46" dur="7.5">weapons because they think that it will</text>
  <text start="1873.68" dur="6.16">prevent future occurrences of mass</text>
  <text start="1876.96" dur="5.76">shootings now recently there was the</text>
  <text start="1879.84" dur="5.67">Christchurch mosque attack and you know</text>
  <text start="1882.72" dur="7.95">several several people had died in that</text>
  <text start="1885.51" dur="9.18">it was very graphic grotesque attack</text>
  <text start="1890.67" dur="6.6">that was aired live out as it was</text>
  <text start="1894.69" dur="5.76">happening it was very if you&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="1897.27" dur="7.16">video I&amp;#39;ve seen it it is disturbing the</text>
  <text start="1900.45" dur="7.08">person who did the shooting was just</text>
  <text start="1904.43" dur="7.3">they were not that it was almost like a</text>
  <text start="1907.53" dur="6.59">game to that right now I do think that</text>
  <text start="1911.73" dur="6.3">there are some oddities about that whole</text>
  <text start="1914.12" dur="7.96">event namely you know the state of mind</text>
  <text start="1918.03" dur="5.79">of the person who was doing that but you</text>
  <text start="1922.08" dur="5.01">know I&amp;#39;m not gonna get into that in this</text>
  <text start="1923.82" dur="5.55">video I will think I will say though</text>
  <text start="1927.09" dur="4.35">that you know as far as that goes I</text>
  <text start="1929.37" dur="6">believe that he was a patsy</text>
  <text start="1931.44" dur="6.76">but anyway besides that the agenda was</text>
  <text start="1935.37" dur="9.37">and always is with these things</text>
  <text start="1938.2" dur="9.63">is to promote gun control right so the</text>
  <text start="1944.74" dur="9.29">goal of this always after these events</text>
  <text start="1947.83" dur="10.83">happen is to enforce stricter gun laws</text>
  <text start="1954.03" dur="6.22">well in this case now New Zealanders</text>
  <text start="1958.66" dur="4.47">have decided they&amp;#39;re going to give over</text>
  <text start="1960.25" dur="5.01">their guns so this happened on Saturday</text>
  <text start="1963.13" dur="6.18">where you know they bought back several</text>
  <text start="1965.26" dur="6.09">several guns in an effort to get rid of</text>
  <text start="1969.31" dur="3.75">the guns off of the street because they</text>
  <text start="1971.35" dur="5.96">think that it&amp;#39;s going to prevent mass</text>
  <text start="1973.06" dur="7.59">shootings well this is not the case if</text>
  <text start="1977.31" dur="6.33">people give up their guns the only</text>
  <text start="1980.65" dur="4.74">people who will have them are criminals</text>
  <text start="1983.64" dur="3.97">that is a fact</text>
  <text start="1985.39" dur="5.22">because criminals don&amp;#39;t care about laws</text>
  <text start="1987.61" dur="4.77">right they don&amp;#39;t care about following</text>
  <text start="1990.61" dur="4.98">laws they don&amp;#39;t care about preserving</text>
  <text start="1992.38" dur="4.89">life most of the time so the only people</text>
  <text start="1995.59" dur="4.19">will have them are criminals and the</text>
  <text start="1997.27" dur="6.48">government and that is not OK</text>
  <text start="1999.78" dur="5.98">so even though this is happening in New</text>
  <text start="2003.75" dur="5.34">Zealand this is something we should be</text>
  <text start="2005.76" dur="5.25">looking out for right because I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="2009.09" dur="8.13">this before where you know when it comes</text>
  <text start="2011.01" dur="9">to taking the guns I have said that it</text>
  <text start="2017.22" dur="5.37">will come down to them convincing the</text>
  <text start="2020.01" dur="6.84">people that they are giving up the guns</text>
  <text start="2022.59" dur="6.66">because they want to right so obviously</text>
  <text start="2026.85" dur="5.1">the government can&amp;#39;t come to your door</text>
  <text start="2029.25" dur="5.13">banging on your door and demand your gun</text>
  <text start="2031.95" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s not gonna work because gun owners</text>
  <text start="2034.38" dur="3.51">are gonna be like take it from my cold</text>
  <text start="2036.48" dur="3.39">dead fingers because you&amp;#39;re not taking</text>
  <text start="2037.89" dur="3.93">it right now I&amp;#39;m not giving it to you</text>
  <text start="2039.87" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s what would happen and they know</text>
  <text start="2041.82" dur="5.79">that so they have to trick the people</text>
  <text start="2044.34" dur="5.58">into thinking that it&amp;#39;s their idea to</text>
  <text start="2047.61" dur="6.45">give up the guns and how to do that well</text>
  <text start="2049.92" dur="5.76">you can do that by making the people</text>
  <text start="2054.06" dur="5.31">believe that guns are so dangerous that</text>
  <text start="2055.68" dur="5.64">we cannot own them and they do that</text>
  <text start="2059.37" dur="3.57">through mass shootings so I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2061.32" dur="4.77">how many of you are familiar with</text>
  <text start="2062.94" dur="6.39">William Cooper but bill Cooper had</text>
  <text start="2066.09" dur="4.44">actually talked about this a long time</text>
  <text start="2069.33" dur="3.51">ago</text>
  <text start="2070.53" dur="4.859">where he had said that the plan of the</text>
  <text start="2072.84" dur="4.17">government why there was you know school</text>
  <text start="2075.389" dur="6.03">shooting school shootings were going to</text>
  <text start="2077.01" dur="7.44">be used as a method to take the guns</text>
  <text start="2081.419" dur="4.921">because then you know of course you have</text>
  <text start="2084.45" dur="3.959">you know kids involved and then that</text>
  <text start="2086.34" dur="4.14">really pulls at the heartstrings so it</text>
  <text start="2088.409" dur="3.331">becomes an emotional motivation now for</text>
  <text start="2090.48" dur="3.36">people to give up the guns because they</text>
  <text start="2091.74" dur="3.45">want to preserve the lives of kids you</text>
  <text start="2093.84" dur="3.27">know if you have so many mass shootings</text>
  <text start="2095.19" dur="4.26">in schools and of course that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="2097.11" dur="4.74">make them gun-free zones they&amp;#39;re sitting</text>
  <text start="2099.45" dur="5.4">ducks for a reason they&amp;#39;re targets for a</text>
  <text start="2101.85" dur="6.33">reason so you know they have these mass</text>
  <text start="2104.85" dur="6.54">shootings at schools and then people are</text>
  <text start="2108.18" dur="4.98">so outraged over all of the mass</text>
  <text start="2111.39" dur="3.51">shootings that they decide guns are too</text>
  <text start="2113.16" dur="4.11">dangerous for people to own and so then</text>
  <text start="2114.9" dur="7.86">we must give them up that is the</text>
  <text start="2117.27" dur="10.11">ultimate goal and so we have to also</text>
  <text start="2122.76" dur="7.79">remember that the reason why the Second</text>
  <text start="2127.38" dur="9">Amendment is even there originally was</text>
  <text start="2130.55" dur="9.82">really to preserve our freedom it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2136.38" dur="5.4">really about hunting or you know</text>
  <text start="2140.37" dur="2.91">protecting ourselves from a home</text>
  <text start="2141.78" dur="4.62">invasion although you know those are</text>
  <text start="2143.28" dur="5.45">good reasons to keep in bear arms it</text>
  <text start="2146.4" dur="9.32">originally was to preserve our freedom</text>
  <text start="2148.73" dur="11.16">to enable us to protect ourselves from a</text>
  <text start="2155.72" dur="6.79">government that becomes too powerful and</text>
  <text start="2159.89" dur="7.75">because of this that is why the</text>
  <text start="2162.51" dur="9.62">government the deep state people who are</text>
  <text start="2167.64" dur="7.17">not acting on behalf of the Americans</text>
  <text start="2172.13" dur="6.19">they are acting on behalf of themselves</text>
  <text start="2174.81" dur="10.1">the people who have been in power for so</text>
  <text start="2178.32" dur="6.59">long they know this is the real reason</text>
  <text start="2185.63" dur="6.31">the First Amendment and the Second</text>
  <text start="2188.46" dur="9.17">Amendment are cornerstone to our</text>
  <text start="2191.94" dur="9.05">freedoms freedom of speech</text>
  <text start="2197.63" dur="6.899">and right to keep in their arms they</text>
  <text start="2200.99" dur="8.869">must be protected at all costs because</text>
  <text start="2204.529" dur="8.851">that is really where our freedom lies</text>
  <text start="2209.859" dur="8.23">without those things then it becomes</text>
  <text start="2213.38" dur="8.449">easy to oppress the people if the people</text>
  <text start="2218.089" dur="9.051">cannot defend themselves against a</text>
  <text start="2221.829" dur="10.871">government that is you know oppressive</text>
  <text start="2227.14" dur="8.05">that is overreaching in its power if the</text>
  <text start="2232.7" dur="4.68">people cannot defend themselves because</text>
