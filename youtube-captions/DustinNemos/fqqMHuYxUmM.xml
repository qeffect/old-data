  <text start="87.89" dur="5.1">which is why I decided to speak out I</text>
  <text start="90.41" dur="5.28">will claim ignorance I was one of those</text>
  <text start="92.99" dur="4.439">who had no idea the system existed and I</text>
  <text start="95.69" dur="4.83">would not have believed it had it not</text>
  <text start="97.429" dur="5.791">happened to me so I think it happened to</text>
  <text start="100.52" dur="5.159">me it could happen to you and I want</text>
  <text start="103.22" dur="5.64">everybody to know their rights to think</text>
  <text start="105.679" dur="4.951">twice before calling CPS and to really</text>
  <text start="108.86" dur="3.42">understand the corruption in the foster</text>
  <text start="110.63" dur="5.04">care system in the family court system</text>
  <text start="112.28" dur="4.92">and as usual follow the money right</text>
  <text start="115.67" dur="4.319">there&amp;#39;s nothing new under this land and</text>
  <text start="117.2" dur="6.539">that&amp;#39;s what all started but my story in</text>
  <text start="119.989" dur="6.41">particular began back in 2015 when my</text>
  <text start="123.739" dur="5.011">son my second son was seven weeks old</text>
  <text start="126.399" dur="4.45">just a little background on myself I</text>
  <text start="128.75" dur="4.2">have seizures I have epilepsy and one of</text>
  <text start="130.849" dur="5.131">the main triggers of my seizures are</text>
  <text start="132.95" dur="4.2">sleep deprivation or lack of sleep so if</text>
  <text start="135.98" dur="4.2">you&amp;#39;re taking care of a newborn you</text>
  <text start="137.15" dur="5.25">ain&amp;#39;t sleeping and my doctor advised me</text>
  <text start="140.18" dur="3.87">to get a nanny or some kind of help for</text>
  <text start="142.4" dur="3.21">at least the nighttime shifts so that I</text>
  <text start="144.05" dur="4.799">could have those eight hours of sleep so</text>
  <text start="145.61" dur="6.84">I hired a nanny and she washed my son</text>
  <text start="148.849" dur="6.301">from 10:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. that was</text>
  <text start="152.45" dur="4.26">her nighttime shift so she started</text>
  <text start="155.15" dur="2.68">watching him when he was about 7 days</text>
  <text start="156.71" dur="3.85">old</text>
  <text start="157.83" dur="4.71">and when he was seven weeks old I woke</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="4.29">up to him screaming at about four</text>
  <text start="162.54" dur="6.63">o&amp;#39;clock in the morning this was July 8</text>
  <text start="164.85" dur="6.87">2015 and I looked at my clock is 406</text>
  <text start="169.17" dur="5.34">like okay either feeding him changing</text>
  <text start="171.72" dur="4.5">him and the crying stopped so I tried to</text>
  <text start="174.51" dur="3.84">go back to sleep a few minutes later he</text>
  <text start="176.22" dur="4.41">starts screaming again and he stops</text>
  <text start="178.35" dur="4.92">screaming stops no this pattern went on</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="4.83">for a few minutes so I finally get up I</text>
  <text start="183.27" dur="5.34">go to his room and she had the door</text>
  <text start="185.46" dur="5.22">propped open he was in his crib swaddled</text>
  <text start="188.61" dur="3.72">and she was rocking him back and forth</text>
  <text start="190.68" dur="4.02">trying to comfort him and like shushing</text>
  <text start="192.33" dur="3.69">in his ear she didn&amp;#39;t really look at me</text>
  <text start="194.7" dur="3.57">or make any eye contact with me I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="196.02" dur="4.53">think she noticed that was there and she</text>
  <text start="198.27" dur="5.16">finally picked him up and put him over</text>
  <text start="200.55" dur="5.22">her shoulder like a burp position and he</text>
  <text start="203.43" dur="3.87">stopped screaming and then she turned</text>
  <text start="205.77" dur="4.71">around and she saw I was at the door and</text>
  <text start="207.3" dur="4.98">I asked her what happened she said I</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="4.86">just fed him no he took the bottle and</text>
  <text start="212.28" dur="3.66">he&amp;#39;s really nasty and I said okay I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="1660.12" dur="3.33">another thing you know the hospital gets</text>
  <text start="1661.47" dur="5.67">federal grants for having this person on</text>
  <text start="1663.45" dur="5.61">staff and she is a pediatrician right</text>
  <text start="1667.14" dur="4.29">she&amp;#39;s not a forensic pathologist she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1669.06" dur="4.32">not a radiologist she&amp;#39;s not any</text>
  <text start="1671.43" dur="4.68">specialty that would give her the</text>
  <text start="1673.38" dur="3.87">authority to make such a diagnosis but</text>
  <text start="1676.11" dur="3.36">she&amp;#39;s the one who writes the court</text>
  <text start="1677.25" dur="4.38">report and she said my son&amp;#39;s injury was</text>
  <text start="1679.47" dur="4.56">caused by non accidental blunt force</text>
  <text start="1681.63" dur="5.25">trauma and it had to have occurred</text>
  <text start="1684.03" dur="5.52">between the hours of 4:00 a.m. and 7:00</text>
  <text start="1686.88" dur="4.83">a.m. which conveniently put both myself</text>
  <text start="1689.55" dur="5.76">and the nanny at home during that time</text>
  <text start="1691.71" dur="5.43">tree so they kept questioning me why it</text>
  <text start="1695.31" dur="5.28">took me so long to take my son to the</text>
  <text start="1697.14" dur="5.52">hospital and because I didn&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="1700.59" dur="4.26">was going on with my son she told me he</text>
  <text start="1702.66" dur="5.4">was gassy I wasn&amp;#39;t there there was no</text>
  <text start="1704.85" dur="6.21">external sign of anything I never would</text>
  <text start="1708.06" dur="5.82">have imagined a head injury based on his</text>
  <text start="1711.06" dur="4.71">symptoms right so that&amp;#39;s what they kept</text>
  <text start="1713.88" dur="4.8">badgering me on they told me I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1715.77" dur="4.44">emotional enough and that I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1718.68" dur="4.2">exhibiting the normal behaviors of a</text>
  <text start="1720.21" dur="4.469">grieving mother and I&amp;#39;m like yeah I was</text>
  <text start="1722.88" dur="3.96">trying to hold myself together you know</text>
  <text start="1724.679" dur="4.5">I wasn&amp;#39;t shocked at what was going on</text>
  <text start="1726.84" dur="4.29">and they told me they were there to help</text>
  <text start="1729.179" dur="4.531">me I&amp;#39;m like what good would it be for me</text>
  <text start="1731.13" dur="4.71">to be crying hysterically with these</text>
  <text start="1733.71" dur="4.35">people that are trying to help me help</text>
  <text start="1735.84" dur="5.49">Stewie logical yeah right</text>
  <text start="1738.06" dur="4.95">so but anyway we sued them and we did</text>
  <text start="1741.33" dur="3.36">all the depositions they admitted that</text>
  <text start="1743.01" dur="3.15">they took my son without a warrant they</text>
  <text start="1744.69" dur="4.11">admitted that there was no exigent</text>
  <text start="1746.16" dur="4.17">circumstance they admitted that they did</text>
  <text start="1748.8" dur="4.32">not follow policy I mean it&amp;#39;s amazing</text>
  <text start="1750.33" dur="5.88">there&amp;#39;s like 28 hours of video than just</text>
  <text start="1753.12" dur="6.02">admitting everything and like like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1756.21" dur="9.15">nothing to them really nothing to them</text>
  <text start="1759.14" dur="9.01">so yeah in December of 2018 we were</text>
  <text start="1765.36" dur="5.97">scheduled to go to trial on June of 2019</text>
  <text start="1768.15" dur="5.4">and Shawn you know advised me he&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1771.33" dur="4.41">I don&amp;#39;t think he will lose at trial okay</text>
  <text start="1773.55" dur="5.31">you will probably win the question is</text>
  <text start="1775.74" dur="5.49">just how much and even if we do win at</text>
  <text start="1778.86" dur="3.48">trial they were going to appeal which</text>
  <text start="1781.23" dur="1.62">means we&amp;#39;re gonna have to start all over</text>
  <text start="1782.34" dur="1.47">again</text>
  <text start="1782.85" dur="3.57">which means they&amp;#39;re gonna have to spend</text>
  <text start="1783.81" dur="4.11">them more money and all the emotional</text>
  <text start="1786.42" dur="2.73">stuff that you&amp;#39;re gonna have to go</text>
  <text start="1787.92" dur="5.37">through you know this will be another</text>
  <text start="1789.15" dur="7.17">three to five years ongoing so my advice</text>
  <text start="1793.29" dur="5.79">would be to to take the money and move</text>
  <text start="1796.32" dur="4.74">on with your life and it was really hard</text>
  <text start="1799.08" dur="3.72">for me Mike you know just on principle</text>
  <text start="1801.06" dur="3.45">alone I&amp;#39;m like I don&amp;#39;t care if I the one</text>
  <text start="1802.8" dur="4.52">one dollar at trial this isn&amp;#39;t about the</text>
  <text start="1804.51" dur="4.8">money now you want to stop on my testing</text>
  <text start="1807.32" dur="6.07">at the same time you don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="1809.31" dur="6.6">stupid so you know a lot of going back</text>
  <text start="1813.39" dur="4.65">and forth and we did settle the final</text>
  <text start="1815.91" dur="3.48">global offer between all the defendants</text>
  <text start="1818.04" dur="4.35">which basically was just the counties</text>
  <text start="1819.39" dur="6.99">and the police department well as 1.49</text>
  <text start="1822.39" dur="6.69">million so it was a good amount of money</text>
  <text start="1826.38" dur="4.5">and you know we had encouraged quite a</text>
  <text start="1829.08" dur="3.24">significant amount of debt during those</text>
  <text start="1830.88" dur="3.66">three years you know fighting for our</text>
  <text start="1832.32" dur="3.87">children and during the lawsuit lost</text>
  <text start="1834.54" dur="4.17">wages I mean a lot of different stuff</text>
  <text start="1836.19" dur="5.39">happening so it gave us a clean slate</text>
  <text start="1838.71" dur="5.04">alright to pay off all our debts to</text>
  <text start="1841.58" dur="3.67">maybe put a down payment on the house</text>
  <text start="1843.75" dur="3.66">which is what we were going to do back</text>
  <text start="1845.25" dur="4.38">in 2015 we were gonna just buy a house</text>
  <text start="1847.41" dur="4.29">and then all this happened of course so</text>
  <text start="1849.63" dur="5.13">it was you know a gift from God I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1851.7" dur="6">thankful for it but I&amp;#39;m not done right</text>
  <text start="1854.76" dur="4.19">now I want these people to be held</text>
  <text start="1857.7" dur="4.01">accountable</text>
  <text start="1858.95" dur="6.36">and this family court system is</text>
  <text start="1861.71" dur="4.59">ridiculous it&amp;#39;s like like my attorney</text>
  <text start="1865.31" dur="2.94">told me all the time they don&amp;#39;t follow</text>
  <text start="1866.3" dur="5.22">the Constitution and that is literally</text>
  <text start="1868.25" dur="6.12">what they do they are a separate piece</text>
  <text start="1871.52" dur="5.07">of law they have their own law and here</text>
  <text start="1874.37" dur="5.91">in California it&amp;#39;s called WIC just a</text>
  <text start="1876.59" dur="5.37">wellness institution code and each state</text>
  <text start="1880.28" dur="4.53">had to come up with its own set of laws</text>
  <text start="1881.96" dur="5.88">in order to qualify for the federal</text>
  <text start="1884.81" dur="4.77">funding which is supplied through ass</text>
  <text start="1887.84" dur="3.06">but through that bill that that Bill</text>
  <text start="1889.58" dur="4.14">Clinton signed through the law that he</text>
  <text start="1890.9" dur="4.5">signed which we should go to yeah so if</text>
  <text start="1893.72" dur="3.06">you want to receive this money you have</text>
  <text start="1895.4" dur="4.71">to come up with your separate set of</text>
  <text start="1896.78" dur="6">laws to qualify and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1900.11" dur="5.76">constitutional law it&amp;#39;s their own</text>
  <text start="1902.78" dur="5.25">separate law and again the log can say</text>
  <text start="1905.87" dur="4.41">anything it wants really it&amp;#39;s all on</text>
  <text start="1908.03" dur="3.45">paper right it&amp;#39;s on paper that you</text>
  <text start="1910.28" dur="2.7">cannot take the child without a warrant</text>
  <text start="1911.48" dur="3.18">it&amp;#39;s on paper that you need to give</text>
  <text start="1912.98" dur="4.71">parental consent for the medical</text>
  <text start="1914.66" dur="4.94">examination that&amp;#39;s on paper but who is</text>
  <text start="1917.69" dur="7.68">holding these people accountable only</text>
  <text start="1919.6" dur="9.76">people like you would blossom they know</text>
  <text start="1925.37" dur="6.12">nobody&amp;#39;s watching so I don&amp;#39;t know I just</text>
  <text start="1929.36" dur="4.17">think it needs to be either completely</text>
  <text start="1931.49" dur="4.32">abolished honestly if I had a magic wand</text>
  <text start="1933.53" dur="5.58">I would you know wave that wand and</text>
  <text start="1935.81" dur="5.61">Family Court is over with because child</text>
  <text start="1939.11" dur="4.2">abuse is already a criminal offense</text>
  <text start="1941.42" dur="3.33">exactly it&amp;#39;s already illegal you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1943.31" dur="3.78">need a special right you don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="1944.75" dur="3.54">go to Family Court the problem is they</text>
  <text start="1947.09" dur="2.82">would have to go through the process</text>
  <text start="1948.29" dur="3.06">right they would have to actually have</text>
  <text start="1949.91" dur="3.21">proof they would have to go through a</text>
  <text start="1951.35" dur="3.3">trial they would have to have a jury and</text>
  <text start="1953.12" dur="2.76">all that stuff which means would delay</text>
  <text start="1954.65" dur="4.53">their funding they wouldn&amp;#39;t get these</text>
  <text start="1955.88" dur="7.08">findings chortles so that&amp;#39;s why they go</text>
  <text start="1959.18" dur="6.75">through Family Court and no due process</text>
  <text start="1962.96" dur="6.12">no I know I grew up in the church I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1965.93" dur="5.7">heard of foster care my whole life has a</text>
  <text start="1969.08" dur="4.89">wonderful thing right that we&amp;#39;re helping</text>
  <text start="1971.63" dur="5.28">these children that they&amp;#39;re in these</text>
  <text start="1973.97" dur="4.89">abusive situations and I don&amp;#39;t blame the</text>
  <text start="1976.91" dur="4.53">foster parents I know a lot of them most</text>
  <text start="1978.86" dur="4.38">of them have good intentions but you</text>
  <text start="1981.44" dur="3.66">really don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on behind</text>
  <text start="1983.24" dur="4.38">the scenes you really don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="1985.1" dur="4.59">social workers will tell you whatever it</text>
  <text start="1987.62" dur="3.74">is you want to hear so that they can get</text>
  <text start="1989.69" dur="3.53">their way</text>
  <text start="1991.36" dur="3.99">and I just imagine the story like mine</text>
  <text start="1993.22" dur="5.189">you know what would a potential foster</text>
  <text start="1995.35" dur="6.36">parent here that this baby the seven</text>
  <text start="1998.409" dur="5.691">week old baby had a cranial fracture</text>
  <text start="2001.71" dur="4.589">while in the care of his abusive mother</text>
  <text start="2004.1" dur="5.169">that&amp;#39;s what a foster parent would here</text>
  <text start="2006.299" dur="4.74">and of course you as a foster parent oh</text>
  <text start="2009.269" dur="4.171">my gosh who is this monster who could do</text>
  <text start="2011.039" dur="5.281">this to a baby right of course we will</text>
  <text start="2013.44" dur="4.92">help this baby but behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="2016.32" dur="3.989">they don&amp;#39;t know that there is no proof</text>
  <text start="2018.36" dur="4.71">there is no investigation there is no</text>
  <text start="2020.309" dur="3.99">due process there is nothing and you</text>
  <text start="2023.07" dur="3.419">know there have been a lot of incidents</text>
  <text start="2024.299" dur="4.35">and allegations that for example in</text>
  <text start="2026.489" dur="4.68">Arizona even by high-level politicians</text>
  <text start="2028.649" dur="4.98">that the CPS system is if not outright</text>
  <text start="2031.169" dur="4.89">helping at least through its negligence</text>
  <text start="2033.629" dur="5.13">aiding in child trafficking absolutely</text>
  <text start="2036.059" dur="4.11">yes even secretary Pompeo right came out</text>
  <text start="2038.759" dur="5.1">with the human trafficking report and I</text>
  <text start="2040.169" dur="7.74">believe it was 67% of child trafficking</text>
  <text start="2043.859" dur="6.78">comes from foster care yeah and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2047.909" dur="4.71">domino effect you know you take a child</text>
  <text start="2050.639" dur="3.93">away from their parents even if they are</text>
  <text start="2052.619" dur="4.111">abusive unit they are alcoholics Earths</text>
  <text start="2054.569" dur="5.01">they are drug addicts so those parents</text>
  <text start="2056.73" dur="4.53">need help right and ripping a child away</text>
  <text start="2059.579" dur="4.111">from them is not helping them or the</text>
  <text start="2061.26" dur="4.26">child right why not take all this money</text>
  <text start="2063.69" dur="4.08">the six hundred and seventy dollars that</text>
  <text start="2065.52" dur="5.549">my mom was offered why not offer it to a</text>
  <text start="2067.77" dur="5.49">parent to get into rehab to you know</text>
  <text start="2071.069" dur="4.8">provide child care whatever it is that</text>
  <text start="2073.26" dur="4.53">this parent needs help in ripping the</text>
  <text start="2075.869" dur="4.02">family apart is not helping anybody and</text>
  <text start="2077.79" dur="5.129">it&amp;#39;s creating the society where children</text>
  <text start="2079.889" dur="5.16">are ultimately vulnerable very</text>
  <text start="2082.919" dur="5.101">vulnerable grow up into adolescents who</text>
  <text start="2085.049" dur="4.29">are insecure who don&amp;#39;t know who to trust</text>
  <text start="2088.02" dur="2.49">right who are you supposed to trust the</text>
  <text start="2089.339" dur="3.421">one people you&amp;#39;re supposed to trust are</text>
  <text start="2090.51" dur="4.559">your parents and they get ripped away</text>
  <text start="2092.76" dur="4.589">from you you grow up with that void for</text>
  <text start="2095.069" dur="5.851">the rest of your life you know I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2097.349" dur="5.881">imagine what that must be like it builds</text>
  <text start="2100.92" dur="4.409">broken people broken people totally</text>
  <text start="2103.23" dur="3.3">broken people you know and I myself I</text>
  <text start="2105.329" dur="3.121">didn&amp;#39;t really connect the dots mean I</text>
  <text start="2106.53" dur="5.519">lost my dad when I was nine months old</text>
  <text start="2108.45" dur="5.69">my dad died in a car accident in Brazil</text>
  <text start="2112.049" dur="4.591">drunk driver when I was nine months old</text>

  <text start="2144.23" dur="6.82">completely cut off from their biological</text>
  <text start="2147.51" dur="6.6">family I can&amp;#39;t imagine the void that you</text>
  <text start="2151.05" dur="6.5">have in your heart and why they do grow</text>
  <text start="2154.11" dur="6.84">up to become prostitutes drug addicts</text>
