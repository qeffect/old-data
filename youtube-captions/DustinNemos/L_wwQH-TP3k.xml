  <text start="31.579" dur="4.561">most of the Nemo&amp;#39;s news network and</text>
  <text start="33.829" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s a few headlines that you need to</text>
  <text start="36.14" dur="3.84">be aware of that you need to know about</text>
  <text start="38.059" dur="4.411">there&amp;#39;s a couple of things going on and</text>
  <text start="39.98" dur="4.829">I&amp;#39;m gonna bring those to you now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="42.47" dur="4.08">gonna also talk about a couple of crazy</text>
  <text start="44.809" dur="5.491">things that you would never expect to</text>
  <text start="46.55" dur="6.66">hear about in modern-day America except</text>
  <text start="50.3" dur="5.64">that the left has gone just kind of full</text>
  <text start="53.21" dur="6.51">full wacky then they&amp;#39;ve lost their minds</text>
  <text start="55.94" dur="6.09">we have daddy Biden basically you know</text>

  <text start="62.03" dur="5.82">just right in front of everyone I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="65.479" dur="3.901">I don&amp;#39;t know how better to call that and</text>
  <text start="67.85" dur="3.6">I don&amp;#39;t mean to be disrespectful to</text>
  <text start="69.38" dur="3.87">those who have you know kind of</text>

  <text start="76.159" dur="4.441">they call it gaps but it&amp;#39;s so bad that</text>
  <text start="79.1" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;ve had actually removed him from</text>
  <text start="80.6" dur="6.57">from doing as many events and and public</text>
  <text start="83.84" dur="7.139">appearances because he&amp;#39;s so inept lately</text>
  <text start="87.17" dur="5.25">now we also have you know and that</text>
  <text start="90.979" dur="2.371">doesn&amp;#39;t that doesn&amp;#39;t bode well for him</text>
  <text start="92.42" dur="4.199">being the front-runner</text>
  <text start="93.35" dur="4.909">you know 2020 clearly and I if some</text>
  <text start="96.619" dur="4.401">people think that there&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="98.259" dur="5.53">sort of a swoop in from the outside</text>
  <text start="101.02" dur="5.049">contender like maybe a Michelle Obama or</text>
  <text start="103.789" dur="5.28">something like that but whatever they</text>
  <text start="106.069" dur="4.891">try it&amp;#39;s not gonna be Biden anyway so we</text>

  <text start="118.729" dur="3.93">elected remember that and least they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="121.399" dur="2.941">being honest about it now but remember</text>

  <text start="124.34" dur="4.29">about running over children so this</text>
  <text start="127.009" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s not take him too seriously he is</text>
  <text start="128.63" dur="6.47">not gonna win but the fact that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.759" dur="9.391">even given a place at the table</text>
  <text start="135.1" dur="6.999">my gosh how far have we come so I want</text>
  <text start="140.15" dur="7.44">to show you guys that real fast as well</text>
  <text start="142.099" dur="8.25">I was watching and reading the reactions</text>
  <text start="147.59" dur="4.68">of my fellow Americans to this tragedy</text>
  <text start="150.349" dur="3.521">in the Permian Basin in West Texas a</text>

  <text start="165.75" dur="3.66">shot in the face</text>
  <text start="167.099" dur="3.691">what is profane is losing the life of a</text>
  <text start="169.41" dur="2.67">high school student in that shooting</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="2.61">yesterday he will not be returning to</text>
  <text start="172.08" dur="4.53">school tomorrow</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="5.339">what is profane is 40,000 gun violence</text>

  <text start="183.09" dur="5.369">this country has not been as urgent as</text>
  <text start="186.239" dur="4.951">not enough as needed it doesn&amp;#39;t meet</text>
  <text start="188.459" dur="4.461">this crisis so let&amp;#39;s be clearly and and</text>
  <text start="191.19" dur="3.93">bluntly and then take decisive action</text>
  <text start="192.92" dur="4.45">universal background checks red flag</text>
  <text start="195.12" dur="4.35">laws ending the sales of weapons of war</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="4.11">but also importantly and politically</text>
  <text start="199.47" dur="4.379">difficult to say buy those weapons of</text>
  <text start="201.48" dur="3.839">war back mandate that not voluntarily</text>
  <text start="203.849" dur="4.291">let&amp;#39;s be really clear with our fellow</text>
  <text start="205.319" dur="6.081">Americans no place for an ak-47 or an</text>
  <text start="208.14" dur="8.34">ar-15 on the streets of our communities</text>
  <text start="211.4" dur="6.94">yeah so he&amp;#39;s really trying hard to mask</text>
  <text start="216.48" dur="4.11">his psychopathy here where he actually</text>
  <text start="218.34" dur="4.229">pretends to care about you but no hit</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="3.6">hit when he when he&amp;#39;s in his deeper</text>
  <text start="222.569" dur="4.14">thoughts he fantasizes about running</text>
  <text start="224.19" dur="4.799">over children he is not a sane</text>
  <text start="226.709" dur="4.021">individual and really what he&amp;#39;s doing is</text>
  <text start="228.989" dur="5.041">being paid to to go after your guns</text>
  <text start="230.73" dur="6.659">because you know no no actual moral</text>
  <text start="234.03" dur="5.7">foundation so he&amp;#39;s just like a puppet</text>
  <text start="237.389" dur="4.111">for hire to whatever you know highest</text>
  <text start="239.73" dur="4.409">bidder he&amp;#39;s just an evil person that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.5" dur="4.47">what they do and frankly he seems to be</text>
  <text start="244.139" dur="4.831">on the in club with some of the the</text>
  <text start="245.97" dur="4.56">weirdos to talk to he&amp;#39;s got the the the</text>
  <text start="248.97" dur="4.079">musician background you know if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="5.97">looked into that where he&amp;#39;s worn some of</text>
  <text start="253.049" dur="5.761">these costumes that would be</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="3.9">questionable from some sort of a pedo</text>
  <text start="258.81" dur="3.81">gate perspective and things of that</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="4.32">nature so you know not to mention his</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="6.06">fantasies who knows what&amp;#39;s going on with</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="6.03">Beto but pray that he does not become a</text>
  <text start="268.68" dur="4.02">serious presidential candidate obviously</text>
  <text start="270.75" dur="4.979">he&amp;#39;s not going to can&amp;#39;t even seem to</text>
  <text start="272.7" dur="4.98">become he can&amp;#39;t even seem to fill up a</text>
  <text start="275.729" dur="3.961">room he&amp;#39;s sort of a Larry Clinton type</text>
  <text start="277.68" dur="4.799">they just keep taking him seriously in</text>
  <text start="279.69" dur="4.86">the media for some reason and we also</text>
  <text start="282.479" dur="4.501">have a former FBI assistant director</text>
  <text start="284.55" dur="6.21">saying that the worst is still to come</text>
  <text start="286.98" dur="6.24">four fired FBI director james comey no</text>
  <text start="290.76" dur="5.43">surprise guys I mean I we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="293.22" dur="6">about this guy so much now for the last</text>
  <text start="296.19" dur="4.98">couple years I&amp;#39;m frankly tired of</text>
  <text start="299.22" dur="3.87">talking about call me I&amp;#39;m ready for him</text>
  <text start="301.17" dur="3.63">to go to Gitmo and for us to not have to</text>
  <text start="303.09" dur="4.41">talk to him about him anymore except</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="5.91">ofcourse as a example for others of what</text>
  <text start="307.5" dur="5.22">not to do but you know he thinks that</text>
  <text start="310.71" dur="4.2">he&amp;#39;s off scot-free but you know he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="312.72" dur="3.6">really and we even have a statements</text>
  <text start="314.91" dur="3.45">like I&amp;#39;ve reported already that you know</text>
  <text start="316.32" dur="4.11">Giuliani was talking about how you know</text>
  <text start="318.36" dur="6.08">in criminal charges are probably gonna</text>
  <text start="320.43" dur="7.32">come so not even just that we also have</text>
  <text start="324.44" dur="5.17">to kind of jump over your old fast Nunez</text>
  <text start="327.75" dur="3.63">even warning about the technology arc</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="4.41">censorship and bias against</text>
  <text start="331.38" dur="5.01">conservatives he&amp;#39;s very concerned so you</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="5.19">know all that kind of just it goes</text>
  <text start="336.39" dur="6.48">together it shows this collusion between</text>
  <text start="339.21" dur="5.43">the MSM and the deep state FBI and</text>
  <text start="342.87" dur="4.14">member Comey was leaking to the media</text>
  <text start="344.64" dur="4.11">and directly of course but still leaking</text>
  <text start="347.01" dur="6.21">to the media whether it was in director</text>
  <text start="348.75" dur="6.9">9 we also have an Islamist mass killer</text>
  <text start="353.22" dur="6.06">and terrorists who went on a mass</text>
  <text start="355.65" dur="6.06">stabbing free spree he stopped his</text>
  <text start="359.28" dur="3.57">stabbing free to high-five a fellow</text>
  <text start="361.71" dur="4.71">Islamist buddy</text>
  <text start="362.85" dur="6.09">and I guess that&amp;#39;s how it works so of</text>
  <text start="366.42" dur="4.95">course it&amp;#39;s not really just a mass</text>
  <text start="368.94" dur="4.2">murder spree they would of course I</text>
  <text start="371.37" dur="4.43">think they the police said that it was</text>
  <text start="373.14" dur="4.44">not a terror crime or a hate crime but</text>
  <text start="375.8" dur="5.08">seems like he was only going after</text>
  <text start="377.58" dur="4.71">non-muslims so in that little weird but</text>
  <text start="380.88" dur="5.52">you won&amp;#39;t hear that through the</text>
  <text start="382.29" dur="6.96">mainstream media generally speaking they</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="7.47">gloss over the facts like that now we</text>
  <text start="389.25" dur="9.87">also have a supposedly Republican board</text>
  <text start="393.87" dur="7.59">or guess talking hat over at MSNBC and</text>
  <text start="399.12" dur="4.14">this is not really a Republican let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.46" dur="4.56">give a little context she&amp;#39;s I think her</text>
  <text start="403.26" dur="5.97">last job was Andrew Cuomo as a political</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="5.22">adviser so she&amp;#39;s definitely not an</text>
  <text start="409.23" dur="4.83">actual Republican but supposedly a</text>
  <text start="411.24" dur="6.27">Republican strategist Susan Dell / CEO</text>
  <text start="414.06" dur="5.03">here and she&amp;#39;s basically saying go after</text>
  <text start="417.51" dur="3.62">the NRA board members</text>
  <text start="419.09" dur="3.6">I go after their businesses and you know</text>
  <text start="421.13" dur="3.45">of course she&amp;#39;s not overtly saying</text>
  <text start="422.69" dur="3.66">violence or anything but this is the</text>
  <text start="424.58" dur="3.51">kind of mentality to go after and punish</text>
  <text start="426.35" dur="5.61">to go after and hurt to go after it and</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="7.17">and and in sort of a press and and</text>
  <text start="431.96" dur="5.07">punish for for daring wrong think in the</text>
  <text start="435.26" dur="3.84">modern liberal world they want to they</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="4.65">want to punish you and this is not a</text>
  <text start="439.1" dur="4.14">Republican I just want to make that very</text>
  <text start="441.68" dur="5.1">clear they they lie about things like</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="6.57">that sometimes now we also have Biden</text>
  <text start="446.78" dur="5.58">you know baddie Biden over here wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="449.81" dur="4.59">be funny if that stuck calling for</text>
  <text start="452.36" dur="6.36">banning magazines that can hold multiple</text>
  <text start="454.4" dur="6.72">bullets and them yeah that&amp;#39;s right he</text>
  <text start="458.72" dur="4.8">actually actually said that okay so</text>
  <text start="461.12" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s crazy right</text>
  <text start="463.52" dur="4.709">you know of course I don&amp;#39;t know what we</text>
  <text start="465.38" dur="4.349">would do with a a single-shot gun I mean</text>
  <text start="468.229" dur="4.651">I guess we could go back to sort of</text>
  <text start="469.729" dur="4.41">black powder guns but first of all that</text>
  <text start="472.88" dur="3.45">would be ridiculous</text>
  <text start="474.139" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;d be like going back to starting our</text>
  <text start="476.33" dur="4.98">fires with sticks and and string and it</text>
  <text start="479.479" dur="4.5">just doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense not to</text>
  <text start="481.31" dur="4.47">mention the fact that the almost</text>
  <text start="483.979" dur="4.201">universally tyrants come for the guns</text>
  <text start="485.78" dur="5.21">before they try to do worse things and</text>
  <text start="488.18" dur="5.01">the Liberals have shown their tyrannical</text>
  <text start="490.99" dur="5.17">intentions not only their nature but</text>
  <text start="493.19" dur="4.5">their intentions they are okay with</text>
  <text start="496.16" dur="3.42">violence and they are okay with hurting</text>
  <text start="497.69" dur="5.61">you and using the state power against</text>
  <text start="499.58" dur="5.43">you no matter what it takes from sois</text>
  <text start="503.3" dur="4.8">well talking about bringing out the</text>
  <text start="505.01" dur="5.49">noose to stop gun owners to you know</text>
  <text start="508.1" dur="4.14">folks like daddy Biden and o&amp;#39;rourke</text>
  <text start="510.5" dur="4.95">talking about taking the guns just</text>
  <text start="512.24" dur="4.56">overtly like this is you know this is</text>
  <text start="515.45" dur="2.43">not a country you want to be unarmed in</text>
  <text start="516.8" dur="2.88">anymore</text>
  <text start="517.88" dur="4.5">the Second Amendment is more important</text>
  <text start="519.68" dur="4.65">now than ever because if Democrats did</text>
  <text start="522.38" dur="4.26">get power it could come to a civil war</text>
  <text start="524.33" dur="3.87">pray it doesn&amp;#39;t I hope it doesn&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="526.64" dur="3.48">certainly don&amp;#39;t call for violence or</text>
  <text start="528.2" dur="5.9">anything like that of course but you</text>
  <text start="530.12" dur="6.75">know that&amp;#39;s why we have it we had to be</text>
  <text start="534.1" dur="6.04">the second amendment was to make it so</text>
  <text start="536.87" dur="4.83">that everyone was on equal footing so</text>
  <text start="540.14" dur="3.18">that you were a threat to you government</text>
  <text start="541.7" dur="4.35">so that they feared you rather than you</text>
  <text start="543.32" dur="5.31">fearing them and that was kind of a</text>
  <text start="546.05" dur="5.58">natural equilibrium and not that served</text>
  <text start="548.63" dur="5.37">a great point for society in that</text>
  <text start="551.63" dur="4.019">an armed society is a polite society and</text>
  <text start="554" dur="3.18">then that kind of goes the same way with</text>
  <text start="555.649" dur="3.961">the government when they have too much</text>
  <text start="557.18" dur="3.899">power then they start not needing to be</text>
  <text start="559.61" dur="4.88">polite and then they stop being polite</text>
  <text start="561.079" dur="6.63">and you know tyranny is a slippery slope</text>
  <text start="564.49" dur="5.519">we also have Dorian the strongest ever</text>
  <text start="567.709" dur="6.12">storm to threaten Florida&amp;#39;s east coast</text>
  <text start="570.009" dur="6.181">hitting the Bahamas and it seems to be</text>
  <text start="573.829" dur="5.401">so far that Florida is going to avoid a</text>
  <text start="576.19" dur="4.48">lot of it I&amp;#39;m on the west coast over</text>
  <text start="579.23" dur="4.38">near the Gulf so I think I&amp;#39;m gonna avoid</text>
  <text start="580.67" dur="4.68">this one for the most part we got some</text>
  <text start="583.61" dur="5">of the rain actually lost power briefly</text>
  <text start="585.35" dur="6.09">but I missed Sunday Night Live gent but</text>
  <text start="588.61" dur="4.75">it wasn&amp;#39;t super bad here for the most</text>
  <text start="591.44" dur="3.87">part actually sunny days and I&amp;#39;m really</text>
  <text start="593.36" dur="4.669">fortunate about that for us but I know</text>
  <text start="595.31" dur="5.07">many people were not I saw footage where</text>
  <text start="598.029" dur="5.23">families even with babies were we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="600.38" dur="5.129">sheltering and ruins of buildings you</text>
  <text start="603.259" dur="5.401">know when floodwaters outside this halls</text>
  <text start="605.509" dur="6.51">the car so um you know prayers out for</text>
  <text start="608.66" dur="5.669">those folks as well and hope that they</text>
  <text start="612.019" dur="4.231">make it through this terrible storm is</text>
  <text start="614.329" dur="3.721">sort of parked on the Bahamas for a</text>
  <text start="616.25" dur="3.81">couple of hours it seems and just it</text>
  <text start="618.05" dur="4.289">stopped moving it&amp;#39;s still moving really</text>
  <text start="620.06" dur="3.959">fast in terms of wind and circulation</text>
  <text start="622.339" dur="5.071">and rotation and all that but it just</text>
  <text start="624.019" dur="7.651">quit quick moving it&amp;#39;s like one mile an</text>
  <text start="627.41" dur="7.71">hour of actual you know move so it it</text>
  <text start="631.67" dur="6.3">just did damage now continuing on we we</text>
  <text start="635.12" dur="5.43">also have briefly this was funny because</text>
  <text start="637.97" dur="4.32">you know the climate alarmists will tell</text>
  <text start="640.55" dur="3.899">you that the end of the world is nigh in</text>
  <text start="642.29" dur="3.659">11 years we&amp;#39;re gonna all you know burn</text>
  <text start="644.449" dur="3.351">to death because of global warming or</text>
  <text start="645.949" dur="6.81">something of that nature</text>
  <text start="647.8" dur="7.87">AOC logic anyway more evidence that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="652.759" dur="6.901">not true deforestation is not actually</text>
  <text start="655.67" dur="7.859">up it&amp;#39;s down about 25 percent in the</text>
  <text start="659.66" dur="7.739">area burned from 2003 to 20,000 to 2019</text>
  <text start="663.529" dur="6.99">so 2019 from 2003 that&amp;#39;s 16 year period</text>
  <text start="667.399" dur="6.031">and that means that over a 16 year</text>
  <text start="670.519" dur="7.291">period we have a 25% decrease in the</text>
  <text start="673.43" dur="6.18">area burned it doesn&amp;#39;t coincide with a</text>
  <text start="677.81" dur="3.749">drier hotter planet like they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="679.61" dur="3.51">to tell you in fact you know if you guys</text>
  <text start="681.559" dur="3.361">have been around for a while you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="683.12" dur="2.32">heard me talk not lately but you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="684.92" dur="2.82">heard me talk</text>
  <text start="685.44" dur="5.43">about the grand solar minimum and and</text>
  <text start="687.74" dur="7.99">things like that and even to the point</text>
  <text start="690.87" dur="7.77">of talking about kind of a the impact</text>
  <text start="695.73" dur="4.38">that that could have on the planet you</text>
  <text start="698.64" dur="4.23">know even in terms of food production</text>
  <text start="700.11" dur="5.55">and such so grand solar minimum is a</text>
  <text start="702.87" dur="5.43">little bit more frightening for me than</text>
  <text start="705.66" dur="4.11">global warming we chew if the planet was</text>
  <text start="708.3" dur="4.61">a degree or two warmer it would probably</text>
  <text start="709.77" dur="6">benefit mankind in in so many ways</text>
  <text start="712.91" dur="4.45">anyway continuing on I don&amp;#39;t want to go</text>
  <text start="715.77" dur="3.6">into too many rants about global warming</text>
  <text start="717.36" dur="4.05">for me it&amp;#39;s a dead topic yeah obviously</text>
  <text start="719.37" dur="4.77">few people still will leave it out there</text>
  <text start="721.41" dur="4.68">but no one really buys into the</text>
  <text start="724.14" dur="4.05">mainstream media it seems to be dying</text>
  <text start="726.09" dur="4.44">here in America so it&amp;#39;s just a matter of</text>
  <text start="728.19" dur="3.9">time and then you see that beautiful</text>
  <text start="730.53" dur="4.98">picture recently where Trump didn&amp;#39;t show</text>
  <text start="732.09" dur="5.37">up to the g7 climate you know wine fest</text>
  <text start="735.51" dur="4.17">and he said we don&amp;#39;t want to waste this</text>
  <text start="737.46" dur="5.49">time on it basically and chase dreams</text>
  <text start="739.68" dur="4.83">and ruin America&amp;#39;s wealth so I love it</text>
  <text start="742.95" dur="2.16">and that&amp;#39;s all you really need to say</text>
  <text start="744.51" dur="4.59">about it right now</text>
  <text start="745.11" dur="6.24">and this one was a funny I thought I</text>
  <text start="749.1" dur="4.53">should mention it because AOC is now</text>
  <text start="751.35" dur="5.16">coming up against apparently the same I</text>
  <text start="753.63" dur="5.16">guess law team that that sued Trump and</text>
  <text start="756.51" dur="4.01">won over him blocking people on Twitter</text>
  <text start="758.79" dur="5.22">saying it&amp;#39;s a First Amendment violation</text>
  <text start="760.52" dur="5.17">so they beat him and now she&amp;#39;s blocking</text>
  <text start="764.01" dur="3.69">people and even though attorneys are</text>
  <text start="765.69" dur="5.04">saying hey you can&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="767.7" dur="5.16">she&amp;#39;s doing it anyway so we&amp;#39;ll see how</text>
  <text start="770.73" dur="5.34">it goes hopefully someone will sue her</text>
  <text start="772.86" dur="4.95">too anyway just kind of funny to let</text>
  <text start="776.07" dur="5.91">them see a taste of their own you know</text>
  <text start="777.81" dur="5.75">blowback now we also have protests and</text>
  <text start="781.98" dur="3.03">near arrests and in assembly</text>
  <text start="783.56" dur="5.74">appropriations</text>
  <text start="785.01" dur="6.39">I guess meeting for SB 276 and it was</text>
  <text start="789.3" dur="5.039">passed on party lines ahead of the</text>
  <text start="791.4" dur="5.31">hearing and the right to choose does not</text>
  <text start="794.339" dur="5.121">apply to childhood vaccinations</text>
  <text start="796.71" dur="7.41">vaccination schedules in California so</text>
  <text start="799.46" dur="6.4">basically Senator Richard pan was a</text>
  <text start="804.12" dur="5.94">Democrat of course was able to show</text>
  <text start="805.86" dur="5.42">through his his bill and a lot of folks</text>
  <text start="810.06" dur="4.26">are gonna have to leave California</text>
  <text start="811.28" dur="5.86">frankly I&amp;#39;ve been talking about how that</text>
  <text start="814.32" dur="3.17">was kind of a necessity anyway for a</text>
  <text start="817.14" dur="2.799">while</text>
  <text start="817.49" dur="7.709">but if you have children don&amp;#39;t stay</text>
  <text start="819.939" dur="7.93">don&amp;#39;t do not take the choice of the easy</text>
  <text start="825.199" dur="5.82">way out of doing permanent lifelong harm</text>
  <text start="827.869" dur="5.31">to your children to just stay in</text>
  <text start="831.019" dur="5.701">California it&amp;#39;s not worth it whatever it</text>
  <text start="833.179" dur="7.111">is the job the friends family you know</text>
  <text start="836.72" dur="4.289">the sunny weather whatever it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="840.29" dur="2.549">not worth it</text>
  <text start="841.009" dur="4.981">share these articles with your friends</text>
  <text start="842.839" dur="5.31">talk to the folks at for example the</text>
  <text start="845.99" dur="3.24">autism one conference you know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="848.149" dur="2.79">bunch of folks that go to those</text>
  <text start="849.23" dur="3.719">conferences and there&amp;#39;s many different</text>
  <text start="850.939" dur="3.84">groups like the backs to the team at vac</text>
  <text start="852.949" dur="3.57">stand in Dell big tree at the high wire</text>
  <text start="854.779" dur="4.05">and other folks out there like Andy</text>

  <text start="858.829" dur="6.12">who who will get you informed on this</text>
  <text start="861.619" dur="8.22">issue but don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t buy into the fear</text>
  <text start="864.949" dur="7.911">just find a way to avoid this and we</text>
  <text start="869.839" dur="6.18">also have last but certainly not least a</text>
