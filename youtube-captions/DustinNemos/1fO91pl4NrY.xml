  <text start="60.48" dur="5.819">someone actually uploaded this document</text>
  <text start="62.489" dur="8.071">afterwards to try to imply guilt where</text>
  <text start="66.299" dur="6.481">it wasn&amp;#39;t now he also are we also have</text>
  <text start="70.56" dur="3.78">to report a lot of angry ma remember</text>
  <text start="72.78" dur="3.21">would the mob surrounded Tucker</text>
  <text start="74.34" dur="3.81">Carlson&amp;#39;s home when his wife was home</text>
  <text start="75.99" dur="2.37">alone and she was in great fear for her</text>
  <text start="78.15" dur="2.67">life</text>
  <text start="78.36" dur="5.1">well another mob has formed this time at</text>

  <text start="87.45" dur="4.38">stabbing him in the heart or you know</text>
  <text start="89.97" dur="3.84">correctly speaking they were talking</text>
  <text start="91.83" dur="4.41">about Abu dude all but it&amp;#39;s not too much</text>
  <text start="93.81" dur="5.28">further to take it you know from an</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="4.71">actual threat to your life between them</text>
  <text start="99.09" dur="3.3">a mob of people outside your home</text>
  <text start="100.95" dur="3.81">threatening to stab the voodoo doll</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="3.93">versus the threatening to staff use it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="104.76" dur="3.48">pretty much still a direct implied</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="3.54">threat to their life so I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="3.36">the voodoo doll thing really matters at</text>
  <text start="109.86" dur="3.079">this point they were pretty much just</text>
  <text start="111.6" dur="3.48">threatening to stab him in the heart</text>
  <text start="112.939" dur="4.601">especially when they&amp;#39;re being that vocal</text>
  <text start="115.08" dur="4.109">and loud about it now we also have a</text>
  <text start="117.54" dur="3.689">nutcase Vito a Roark</text>

  <text start="122.909" dur="4.171">guy that fantasized and it&amp;#39;s proven he</text>
  <text start="125.58" dur="3.899">had its documents come out a fantasized</text>
  <text start="127.08" dur="5.699">he was writing he was actually writing</text>
  <text start="129.479" dur="6.18">about his fantasy to run over children</text>
  <text start="132.779" dur="4.141">so the sky&amp;#39;s deranged not to mention</text>
  <text start="135.659" dur="5.091">that weird music and</text>
  <text start="136.92" dur="6.84">and it is very hard to think about this</text>
  <text start="140.75" dur="6.13">and then he smiles and laughs must be</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="3.75">really hard to think about it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="146.88" dur="2.939">liars</text>
  <text start="147.51" dur="4.1">give likeness a tell is he&amp;#39;s telling you</text>
  <text start="149.819" dur="5.311">that he&amp;#39;s actually calling you as a liar</text>
  <text start="151.61" dur="5.41">it&amp;#39;s a tell now I think I don&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="155.13" dur="5.39">the exact phrase that they call that</text>
  <text start="157.02" dur="6.87">though something Liars tale or something</text>
  <text start="160.52" dur="5.32">Tiananmen Square 2.0 and this is</text>
  <text start="163.89" dur="5.19">question so if you have into paying</text>
  <text start="165.84" dur="6.119">attention attentions are not only rising</text>
  <text start="169.08" dur="4.68">on our side of the economic war but</text>
  <text start="171.959" dur="3.661">China is having some pretty big issues</text>
  <text start="173.76" dur="4.41">as well in fact Hong Kong which is sort</text>
  <text start="175.62" dur="4.38">of a separate country within China two</text>
  <text start="178.17" dur="4.2">different governmental systems but one</text>
  <text start="180" dur="3.989">nation they are having millions of</text>
  <text start="182.37" dur="4.83">people turn out for these protests in</text>
  <text start="183.989" dur="5.041">fact they&amp;#39;re starting to get assimilated</text>
  <text start="187.2" dur="3.99">into the greater power structure of</text>
  <text start="189.03" dur="3.66">China which you know there used to a</text>
  <text start="191.19" dur="3.03">little bit more freedom in Hong Kong and</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="4.859">they&amp;#39;re not liking it at all</text>
  <text start="194.22" dur="5.22">but they&amp;#39;re you know China the</text>
  <text start="197.549" dur="3.56">government there of course is gonna use</text>
  <text start="199.44" dur="4.62">force and violence and just sort of</text>
  <text start="201.109" dur="5.321">violate its side of the agreements but</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="4.11">we also have the very real risk this</text>
  <text start="206.43" dur="3.99">will turn into bloodshed they&amp;#39;re even</text>
  <text start="208.17" dur="4.74">threatening on TV and they&amp;#39;re using you</text>
  <text start="210.42" dur="5.039">know propaganda videos of soldiers</text>
  <text start="212.91" dur="4.41">training about shooting citizens and</text>
  <text start="215.459" dur="3.12">protests or some such like that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="2.699">just putting it on TV they&amp;#39;re blatantly</text>
  <text start="218.579" dur="5.041">saying look this this is about to happen</text>
  <text start="220.019" dur="6.991">you better not push us and of course</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="7.16">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not going to work</text>
  <text start="227.01" dur="6.33">hopefully we will not see further</text>
  <text start="230.78" dur="4.929">violence in the streets but I I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="233.34" dur="4.38">optimistic about that on either side</text>
  <text start="235.709" dur="5.011">backing down of course and then these</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="4.889">people are rightly protesting and they</text>
  <text start="240.72" dur="5.43">will of course be punished for it they</text>
  <text start="242.609" dur="6.841">don&amp;#39;t have the Constitution and they do</text>
  <text start="246.15" dur="6.119">have a pretty powerful communist</text>
  <text start="249.45" dur="4.08">dictatorship government we also have</text>
  <text start="252.269" dur="3">some of the opioid distributors</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="5.009">proposing ten billion dollar settlement</text>
  <text start="255.269" dur="5.041">to make a flood of lawsuits go away so I</text>
  <text start="258.539" dur="4.311">hope that they do not get their way</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="5.64">because this pennies on the dollar</text>
  <text start="262.85" dur="4.13">agreements for just making it go away</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="4.24">and not</text>
  <text start="266.98" dur="5.79">having to suffer the the real cost of</text>
  <text start="270.19" dur="4.98">justice and and you know basically these</text>
  <text start="272.77" dur="4.92">are fines to just make it go away while</text>
  <text start="275.17" dur="4.32">they maintain a profit margin you know</text>
  <text start="277.69" dur="3.33">ten percent of your costs and a fine</text>
  <text start="279.49" dur="4.5">every year who cares if you break the</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="4.53">rules this is why nothing gets better so</text>
  <text start="283.99" dur="4.41">I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think that this should</text>
  <text start="285.55" dur="5.76">be done but we&amp;#39;ll see how it goes</text>
  <text start="288.4" dur="5.46">they are of course suffering massive</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="4.29">massive massive liability for the damage</text>
  <text start="293.86" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;ve done including to my own family</text>
  <text start="295.6" dur="6.9">I have no sympathy for Big Pharma now we</text>
  <text start="299.35" dur="5.7">also have vice-president pence signaling</text>
  <text start="302.5" dur="5.58">us plans to sanction top China officials</text>
  <text start="305.05" dur="5.28">over the human rights abuse look we</text>
  <text start="308.08" dur="4.62">could go through a ton of human rights</text>
  <text start="310.33" dur="4.08">abuses in China I think in this</text>
  <text start="312.7" dur="3.87">particular articles are talking about</text>
  <text start="314.41" dur="3.72">the eager Muslims being held in</text>
  <text start="316.57" dur="4.02">internment camps more than a million of</text>

  <text start="320.59" dur="4.53">harvested for organ harvesting things</text>
  <text start="322.18" dur="4.52">like that and sold on the market for</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="4.56">people that want to get new organs of</text>
  <text start="326.7" dur="6.13">terrible things going on over there and</text>
