  <text start="101.79" dur="5.88">more holistic things but also from the</text>
  <text start="105.21" dur="4.65">perspective of you know we need teachers</text>
  <text start="107.67" dur="5.04">out there we need people that will take</text>
  <text start="109.86" dur="4.59">this information keep you know be</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="3.06">interested in it keep digging and learn</text>
  <text start="114.45" dur="3.809">more there&amp;#39;s always more to learn even</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="5.19">you know I&amp;#39;ve been learning 15 16 years</text>
  <text start="118.259" dur="4.32">and I don&amp;#39;t know a third of it but take</text>
  <text start="120.96" dur="3.72">that to their communities and help</text>
  <text start="122.579" dur="3.561">people they do free classes not kind of</text>
  <text start="124.68" dur="4.74">stuff show people some of these things</text>
  <text start="126.14" dur="7.42">because you know a lot of these things</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="7.039">people have today can be helped from</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="9.72">either a nutrition perspective or a</text>
  <text start="136.459" dur="8.591">detox perspective it can be very simple</text>
  <text start="143.28" dur="3.959">like people are very short on minerals</text>
  <text start="145.05" dur="4.29">if you want minerals get some celtic</text>
  <text start="147.239" dur="3.981">salt it&amp;#39;s basically free if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="149.34" dur="4.71">taking 1/4 spoon of celtic salt a day</text>
  <text start="151.22" dur="4.96">salt is great for you they convince</text>
  <text start="154.05" dur="3.57">people that it&amp;#39;s bad for you but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="156.18" dur="3.029">really not it&amp;#39;s great for you and then</text>
  <text start="157.62" dur="4.68">celtic salt is almost every mineral that</text>
  <text start="159.209" dur="5.131">you need you know there&amp;#39;s organic</text>
  <text start="162.3" dur="6.12">eggshells from chickens a great source</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="5.61">of calcium and trace minerals you can if</text>
  <text start="168.42" dur="3.12">you if you have the stomach for because</text>
  <text start="169.95" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s really acidic you can take mustard</text>
  <text start="171.54" dur="8.729">seed and then you can get selenium</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="14.76">through mustard seed I just borax err</text>
  <text start="180.269" dur="11.101">yeah I know about borax that you can</text>
  <text start="188.13" dur="5.7">neutralize a lot of the chemical bad</text>
  <text start="191.37" dur="6.089">chemicals in water like your bath water</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="9.24">and stuff some borax in your bath water</text>
  <text start="197.459" dur="6.891">won&amp;#39;t have that you know you know what</text>
  <text start="203.07" dur="4.229">they put in the water</text>
  <text start="204.35" dur="4.66">laureen&amp;#39;s and things like that those</text>
  <text start="207.299" dur="5.791">chemicals and stuff that they put in the</text>
  <text start="209.01" dur="6.78">water it neutralizes it but then I read</text>
  <text start="213.09" dur="4.26">where you could actually drink yeah</text>
  <text start="215.79" dur="4.979">that&amp;#39;s what the one of the things I</text>
  <text start="217.35" dur="5.009">talked about so you know there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="220.769" dur="3.451">things either you get too much of the</text>
  <text start="222.359" dur="3.121">bad stuff and you&amp;#39;re toxic or you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="224.22" dur="3.78">get enough for the good stuff and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="225.48" dur="5.909">deficient the deficiencies are very easy</text>
  <text start="228" dur="5.43">to solve because you can do smoothies</text>
  <text start="231.389" dur="3.391">for example and get you know you need to</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="3.42">be eating probably two-thirds of your</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="4.049">diet is raw leafy green veggies</text>
  <text start="236.85" dur="3.6">smoothies are great you can&amp;#39;t even chew</text>
  <text start="238.829" dur="3.901">that many vegetables a day like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.45" dur="4.74">just not able to do that anymore you</text>
  <text start="242.73" dur="6.089">need to do the smoothies everyone should</text>
  <text start="245.19" dur="5.31">be doing these smoothies yeah I use a</text>
  <text start="248.819" dur="3.901">Vitamix and make smoothie you can do</text>
  <text start="250.5" dur="3.45">juicing I have a juicer but it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="252.72" dur="5.63">expensive because you need a lot more</text>
  <text start="253.95" dur="4.4">vegetables to get the juice and you know</text>
  <text start="260.45" dur="4.839">yeah it&amp;#39;s a very powerful especially</text>
  <text start="263.22" dur="3.72">like if you have cancer or something and</text>
  <text start="265.289" dur="3.391">you do the Gerson thing they</text>
  <text start="266.94" dur="3">just use vegetables all day organic</text>
  <text start="268.68" dur="2.79">vegetables you should always be doing</text>
  <text start="269.94" dur="12.69">organic or you&amp;#39;re destroying your gut</text>
  <text start="271.47" dur="15.63">bacteria but there&amp;#39;s a code on the</text>
  <text start="282.63" dur="7.95">organic produce yeah because a lot of</text>
  <text start="287.1" dur="6.83">the organ it says organic but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="290.58" dur="6.15">our organic it&amp;#39;s just in an organic</text>
  <text start="293.93" dur="4.24">section with a label that says are gay</text>
  <text start="296.73" dur="3.48">but when you look at the code you can</text>
  <text start="298.17" dur="6.15">tell whether it&amp;#39;s really organic or</text>
  <text start="300.21" dur="5.79">anything no I don&amp;#39;t know the code and if</text>
  <text start="304.32" dur="3.27">you go to look at this stuff from China</text>
  <text start="306" dur="4.98">or something I wouldn&amp;#39;t trust it to be</text>
  <text start="307.59" dur="9.27">organic at all so you have to look into</text>
  <text start="310.98" dur="8.34">that there is a code for it yeah organic</text>
  <text start="316.86" dur="5.97">and if it starts with a nine it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="319.32" dur="5.52">organic so it has a lot of number if it</text>
  <text start="322.83" dur="4.08">starts with an eight it&amp;#39;s organic or if</text>
  <text start="324.84" dur="4.53">it starts with a nine it&amp;#39;s not organic</text>
  <text start="326.91" dur="5.55">and I&amp;#39;ve caught a lot of things in the</text>
  <text start="329.37" dur="7.35">organic bin that&amp;#39;s not a fraud yeah</text>
  <text start="332.46" dur="5.97">there&amp;#39;s a lot of fraud there so you know</text>
  <text start="336.72" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;ll talk about toxicity but that&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="338.43" dur="4.11">complicated so let me run down a few of</text>
  <text start="341.01" dur="3.659">the deficiencies that a lot of people</text>
  <text start="342.54" dur="4.23">have and this is not to be all-inclusive</text>
  <text start="344.669" dur="4.441">and sometimes if you have specific</text>
  <text start="346.77" dur="5.67">conditions you need to to look into the</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="4.95">you know how to deal this to do these</text>
  <text start="352.44" dur="3.18">things with your condition obviously</text>
  <text start="354.06" dur="3.359">some things are contraindicated because</text>
  <text start="355.62" dur="5.28">some of this stuff&amp;#39;s very powerful like</text>
  <text start="357.419" dur="5.671">iodine everyone basically is deficient</text>
  <text start="360.9" dur="3.99">in iodine unless you&amp;#39;re one of those</text>
  <text start="363.09" dur="3.54">weird people that are you know juicing</text>
  <text start="364.89" dur="5.19">sea vegetables every day it&amp;#39;s unlikely</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="5.82">you&amp;#39;re not gonna get enough and you know</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="6.57">it it&amp;#39;s an easy cheap thing to solve</text>
  <text start="372.45" dur="5.79">with a bottle of you know I use I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="376.65" dur="3.21">know if you could see it this little</text>
  <text start="378.24" dur="3.12">bottle right here it&amp;#39;s actually the same</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="3.39">bottle from the Infowars version of</text>
  <text start="381.36" dur="6.36">iodine but I started making my own I</text>
  <text start="383.25" dur="7.53">just use the same bottle lugol&amp;#39;s lugol&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="387.72" dur="4.32">iodine that say every nutrient has like</text>
  <text start="390.78" dur="3.5">a thousand different things that does in</text>
  <text start="392.04" dur="2.24">your body</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="3.31">yeah notice more energy and stuff like</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="1.9">that</text>
  <text start="398.46" dur="3.22">it</text>
  <text start="399.46" dur="4.32">for example if you&amp;#39;re pregnant you</text>
  <text start="401.68" dur="3.959">double how much of this you take and you</text>
  <text start="403.78" dur="4.35">get a smarter baby you have a higher IQ</text>
  <text start="405.639" dur="3.84">baby because this is one of those things</text>
  <text start="408.13" dur="3.659">that&amp;#39;s really essential for the</text>
  <text start="409.479" dur="3.69">development of the brain even when</text>
  <text start="411.789" dur="3.331">you&amp;#39;re nursing you want to double this</text>
  <text start="413.169" dur="3.991">up like my wife doubles up how much of</text>
  <text start="415.12" dur="4.47">this she takes and you can this is a</text>
  <text start="417.16" dur="6.03">very simple DIY recipe at home to make</text>
  <text start="419.59" dur="5.19">lugol&amp;#39;s iodine and you can make that</text>
  <text start="423.19" dur="3.72">take a couple drops a day goes a long</text>
  <text start="424.78" dur="6.72">ways very cheap if you do it that way</text>
  <text start="426.91" dur="6.12">and then that and then magnesium again</text>
  <text start="431.5" dur="8.51">90 plus percent of people are deficient</text>
  <text start="433.03" dur="6.98">in magnesium almost everyone is it</text>
  <text start="442.08" dur="5.32">that&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;re probably thinking a</text>
  <text start="444.28" dur="5.94">potassium but yeah you can it well</text>
  <text start="447.4" dur="3.93">people are short of potassium too but if</text>
  <text start="450.22" dur="2.46">you go through with the bananas you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="451.33" dur="4.74">gonna get way too much sugar another</text>
  <text start="452.68" dur="5.07">option for potassium is one of you can</text>
  <text start="456.07" dur="3.24">see all my bottles think I have tons of</text>
  <text start="457.75" dur="3.449">different things everywhere these are</text>
  <text start="459.31" dur="3.78">some of the things that I just bought in</text>
  <text start="461.199" dur="3.631">powder form and I just kind of put in my</text>
  <text start="463.09" dur="4.32">own jars because I have my own jars now</text>
  <text start="464.83" dur="4.95">and then I&amp;#39;ve got like old recycled wine</text>
  <text start="467.41" dur="3.81">bottles my borax is in the other room</text>
  <text start="469.78" dur="9.629">but it&amp;#39;s in a big liquor bottle I mean</text>
  <text start="471.22" dur="12.06">that just I like to recycle bottles no</text>
  <text start="479.409" dur="5.79">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s fine in people 20 Mule</text>
  <text start="483.28" dur="6.53">Team borax from the laundry detergent</text>
  <text start="485.199" dur="7.621">section yeah yeah people use it as that</text>
  <text start="489.81" dur="6.07">so I&amp;#39;ll get to borax in a second because</text>
  <text start="492.82" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s exciting magnesium and iodine those</text>
  <text start="495.88" dur="4.529">two things and magnesium is responses</text>
  <text start="498.22" dur="3.569">it&amp;#39;s I think the number four mineral in</text>
  <text start="500.409" dur="2.82">your body minerals are very very</text>
  <text start="501.789" dur="3.901">important probably more important than</text>
  <text start="503.229" dur="8.611">vitamins but people don&amp;#39;t pay a lot of</text>
  <text start="505.69" dur="8.159">attention to that what helps you sleep</text>
  <text start="511.84" dur="3.36">it relaxes the muscles that&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="513.849" dur="9.721">it&amp;#39;s hundreds of things that it does</text>
  <text start="515.2" dur="10.74">yeah but it has trying to think of what</text>
  <text start="523.57" dur="7.65">you take the magnesium with in order to</text>
  <text start="525.94" dur="6.96">get sleep but but there are several</text>
  <text start="531.22" dur="4.56">things you can take magnesium</text>
  <text start="532.9" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s to help calm me nerves relax you</text>
  <text start="535.78" dur="4.05">and help you get a good night&amp;#39;s sleep</text>
  <text start="538" dur="3.6">well a lot of people like to take their</text>
  <text start="539.83" dur="3.24">magnesium right before bed because it</text>
  <text start="541.6" dur="3.72">helps with the relaxation that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="543.07" dur="4.8">magnesium that wine bottle right there I</text>
  <text start="545.32" dur="3.87">like to use dark color glasses just a</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="3.63">lot of these things are light sensitive</text>
  <text start="549.19" dur="4.5">some of them are magnesium I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="551.5" dur="5.19">is but I just use dark colored glass in</text>
  <text start="553.69" dur="7.02">case so those two things between iodine</text>
  <text start="556.69" dur="7.05">and magnesium will actually cure for TR</text>
  <text start="560.71" dur="6.18">yeah 40% of the deficiency disease in</text>
  <text start="563.74" dur="4.41">the world so of all the diseases that</text>
  <text start="566.89" dur="3.48">people get because they&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="568.15" dur="4.2">enough nutrition that&amp;#39;s almost half of</text>
  <text start="570.37" dur="4.98">it and you can do those for pennies a</text>
  <text start="572.35" dur="6.63">day at home no one almost anyone in the</text>
  <text start="575.35" dur="6.42">world can afford that so those two</text>
  <text start="578.98" dur="5.28">things are massive in their impact on</text>
  <text start="581.77" dur="4.77">the body and there are very cheap very</text>
  <text start="584.26" dur="5.94">absorbing ways of doing it I use</text>
  <text start="586.54" dur="5.72">magnesium chloride USP and I use lugol&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="590.2" dur="4.43">iodine which is a combination of</text>
  <text start="592.26" dur="4.99">elemental iodine</text>
  <text start="594.63" dur="6.91">they&amp;#39;re called prill drills that you can</text>
  <text start="597.25" dur="5.58">buy and potassium iodide which is the</text>
  <text start="601.54" dur="3.39">stuff that they pass out for like</text>
  <text start="602.83" dur="4.13">nuclear fallout or radiation pills or</text>
  <text start="604.93" dur="5.34">something like that</text>
  <text start="606.96" dur="4.9">and those two things are everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="610.27" dur="3.06">deficient then basically safe to assume</text>
  <text start="611.86" dur="2.76">you&amp;#39;re deficient in it the soil is</text>
  <text start="613.33" dur="2.61">depleted so you&amp;#39;re not going to get a</text>
  <text start="614.62" dur="3.15">lot of that from the soil and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="615.94" dur="3.87">lot of nutrition&amp;#39;s a lot of nutrients</text>
  <text start="617.77" dur="4.41">now some other things that people are</text>
  <text start="619.81" dur="4.83">generally deficient in you know</text>
  <text start="622.18" dur="6.09">potassium and we talked about the banana</text>
  <text start="624.64" dur="7.44">thing you can get the little jars of</text>
  <text start="628.27" dur="5.49">cream of tartar that is like a huge</text>
  <text start="632.08" dur="3.96">amount of potassium and a small serving</text>
  <text start="633.76" dur="4.08">without all the sugar yeah it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="636.04" dur="4.26">get enough potassium through bananas and</text>
  <text start="637.84" dur="4.32">food is you have to eat a lot but you</text>
  <text start="640.3" dur="3.96">can do like a I think it&amp;#39;s about half a</text>
  <text start="642.16" dur="3.96">spoon in a day of that stuff and you get</text>
  <text start="644.26" dur="10.08">a lot of the potassium right there and</text>
  <text start="646.12" dur="11.69">that&amp;#39;s pennies a day itself helps about</text>
  <text start="654.34" dur="9.03">yeah and I used to get him really bad</text>
  <text start="657.81" dur="7.24">when I was working you know we would go</text>
  <text start="663.37" dur="3.529">out and have like a glass of wine or</text>
  <text start="665.05" dur="3.319">something after work working</text>
  <text start="666.899" dur="4.141">television you&amp;#39;re all stressed out and</text>
  <text start="668.369" dur="4.59">after a while I just would get leg</text>
  <text start="671.04" dur="6.75">cramps I think from drinking the wine</text>
  <text start="672.959" dur="5.701">cuz if I didn&amp;#39;t go have the line they</text>
  <text start="677.79" dur="6.12">would ease up</text>
  <text start="678.66" dur="5.7">but I&amp;#39;m true to those and maybe try some</text>
  <text start="683.91" dur="1.83">of that</text>
  <text start="684.36" dur="3.419">you know cream of tartar it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="685.74" dur="4.439">from the winemaking process that they</text>
  <text start="687.779" dur="5.701">get that so that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="690.179" dur="4.47">yeah another one is the selenium you</text>
  <text start="693.48" dur="3.539">know the best way I found to get</text>
  <text start="694.649" dur="4.62">selenium without you know I try to do my</text>
  <text start="697.019" dur="3.93">own DIY versions from a food based</text>
  <text start="699.269" dur="5.401">source or a raw source as much as I can</text>
  <text start="700.949" dur="5.19">rather yeah if you&amp;#39;re buying pills all</text>
  <text start="704.67" dur="4.169">the time even if they&amp;#39;re good pills it</text>
  <text start="706.139" dur="5.341">gets to be I do like 40 supplements you</text>
  <text start="708.839" dur="3.451">know I would be $500 a month to do that</text>
  <text start="711.48" dur="4.709">much gonna be crazy</text>
  <text start="712.29" dur="6.659">or more another one is selenium and</text>
  <text start="716.189" dur="4.71">selenium cheap source of doing that is</text>
  <text start="718.949" dur="4.411">mustard seed some people say Brazil nuts</text>
  <text start="720.899" dur="4.92">but maybe the soil didn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="723.36" dur="5.93">selenium to give it so you never know</text>
  <text start="725.819" dur="5.58">with Brazil nuts and they&amp;#39;re expensive</text>
  <text start="729.29" dur="3.88">selenium is kind of one of those trace</text>
  <text start="731.399" dur="3.391">elements that you need you don&amp;#39;t need a</text>
  <text start="733.17" dur="3.149">lot of it but you need some of it and it</text>
  <text start="734.79" dur="3.75">has a lot of different effects in the</text>
  <text start="736.319" dur="3.69">body you know it&amp;#39;s hard to narrow it</text>
  <text start="738.54" dur="3.539">down on one thing because everything</text>
  <text start="740.009" dur="3.601">there&amp;#39;s only like 20-something vitamins</text>
  <text start="742.079" dur="4.5">and then there&amp;#39;s thousands of functions</text>
  <text start="743.61" dur="9.63">in the body so each one has all these</text>
  <text start="746.579" dur="9.93">effects they&amp;#39;ve got these agitators paid</text>
  <text start="753.24" dur="4.409">agitators on television all these things</text>
  <text start="756.509" dur="4.411">that they&amp;#39;re saying and doing her</text>
  <text start="757.649" dur="5.31">designed to agitate us and while I was</text>
  <text start="760.92" dur="9.509">subjected to those frequencies because I</text>
  <text start="762.959" dur="10.59">pulled the cord noticed everything but I</text>
  <text start="770.429" dur="5.34">had stress I had anxiety I had panic</text>
  <text start="773.549" dur="5.431">attacks I had migraine headaches I had</text>
  <text start="775.769" dur="6.721">so many bad effects from just the</text>
  <text start="778.98" dur="6.659">frequencies mm-hmm and also probably</text>
  <text start="782.49" dur="5.789">chemicals and stuff sugar you know</text>
  <text start="785.639" dur="4.401">things like that very is it whole body</text>
  <text start="788.279" dur="4.53">toxin that destroys your health</text>
  <text start="790.04" dur="5.08">yeah and then plus you&amp;#39;re producing with</text>
  <text start="792.809" dur="4.62">the stretch of producing more chemicals</text>
  <text start="795.12" dur="5.28">inside your body that&amp;#39;s exacerbating it</text>
  <text start="797.429" dur="4.891">so anything that calmed me down</text>
  <text start="800.4" dur="3.99">but selenium it seems like I&amp;#39;ve read</text>
  <text start="802.32" dur="3.48">something about that being good for</text>
  <text start="804.39" dur="3">nerve and I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="805.8" dur="6.39">people like me that have panic attacks</text>
  <text start="807.39" dur="7.74">that are fear have a lot of fear I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="812.19" dur="4.8">so much afraid anymore or have my panic</text>
  <text start="815.13" dur="7.35">attacks anymore since I got rid of my</text>
  <text start="816.99" dur="8.13">cable mmm-hmm what I still you know less</text>
  <text start="822.48" dur="5.76">caffeine makes me feel calm you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="825.12" dur="6.21">still paying attention yeah well people</text>
  <text start="828.24" dur="4.65">want to you know get you some recycled</text>
  <text start="831.33" dur="3.57">wine jars get you some dark-coloured</text>
  <text start="832.89" dur="5.4">bottles you can buy little bottles like</text>
  <text start="834.9" dur="5.64">this very cheap they&amp;#39;re nice set your</text>
  <text start="838.29" dur="4.08">own home pharmacy up of things that you</text>
  <text start="840.54" dur="3.21">are probably going to be deficient in</text>
  <text start="842.37" dur="3.86">and take those every day like you would</text>
  <text start="843.75" dur="2.48">a supplement</text>
  <text start="852.95" dur="4.36">well first I&amp;#39;m gonna run through things</text>
  <text start="855.09" dur="5.16">that the things that everybody needs</text>
  <text start="857.31" dur="4.35">here so everybody needs more selenium</text>
  <text start="860.25" dur="4.97">because you&amp;#39;re not getting enough in</text>
  <text start="861.66" dur="6.12">your food and the soil is too depleted</text>
  <text start="865.22" dur="4">everybody needs iodine and magnesium</text>
  <text start="867.78" dur="4.56">because 90 plus percent of people are</text>
  <text start="869.22" dur="5.49">deficient in those everybody is if</text>
  <text start="872.34" dur="3.87">almost everybody&amp;#39;s deficient in zinc the</text>
  <text start="874.71" dur="4.23">best form of zinc is a cheap powder</text>
  <text start="876.21" dur="4.44">called zinc orotate and you know these</text>
  <text start="878.94" dur="3.57">kind of things you have to do your do a</text>
  <text start="880.65" dur="3.39">little bit of research on it every you</text>
  <text start="882.51" dur="3.99">know before you get into each one</text>
  <text start="884.04" dur="4.71">because zinc can hurt you if you take</text>
  <text start="886.5" dur="4.68">too much this is like a tiny little</text>
  <text start="888.75" dur="3.81">little quarter spoon a day not even</text>
  <text start="891.18" dur="3.03">really it like more like an eighth of a</text>
  <text start="892.56" dur="3.39">teaspoon a day of zinc is sufficient</text>
  <text start="894.21" dur="3.45">maybe a little bit extra if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="895.95" dur="3.09">pregnant and there&amp;#39;s some of these</text>
  <text start="897.66" dur="3.33">things have rules of with them like if</text>
  <text start="899.04" dur="3.66">you if you take zinc you block copper</text>
  <text start="900.99" dur="3.45">and you don&amp;#39;t need a lot of copper but</text>
  <text start="902.7" dur="3.87">if you take it every single day and you</text>
  <text start="904.44" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t have copper coming and you can be</text>
  <text start="906.57" dur="3.78">deficient in copper but too much copper</text>
  <text start="908.82" dur="3.12">can make you literally insane they</text>
  <text start="910.35" dur="4.44">actually creates insanity is one of the</text>
  <text start="911.94" dur="4.77">side effects so it&amp;#39;s not difficult to</text>
  <text start="914.79" dur="4.26">know these things you just have to do a</text>
  <text start="916.71" dur="5.13">little research on each one but people</text>
  <text start="919.05" dur="4.35">will experience generally good things in</text>
  <text start="921.84" dur="3.72">their life if they get rid of these</text>
  <text start="923.4" dur="4.88">deficiencies and then they&amp;#39;ll in many</text>
  <text start="925.56" dur="5.67">cases they&amp;#39;ll eliminate disease boron</text>
  <text start="928.28" dur="4.27">which is what we&amp;#39;re using borax for I</text>
  <text start="931.23" dur="2.85">mean you can buy little cheap boron</text>
  <text start="932.55" dur="3">pills they&amp;#39;re not expensive</text>
  <text start="934.08" dur="4.53">you know if you would rather not buy</text>
  <text start="935.55" dur="5.1">laundry detergent it boron is one of</text>
  <text start="938.61" dur="3.69">those things that people in the in the</text>
  <text start="940.65" dur="3.96">mainstream medical industry have really</text>
  <text start="942.3" dur="3.93">attacked and demonized there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="944.61" dur="3.12">people out there saying it&amp;#39;s poison it</text>
  <text start="946.23" dur="3.69">you know everything else because it is</text>
  <text start="947.73" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s a poison to certain insects like</text>
  <text start="949.92" dur="5.13">roaches and stuff but we&amp;#39;re not roaches</text>
  <text start="952.38" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;re actually we need boron when you</text>
  <text start="955.05" dur="4.53">look into the history of boron there was</text>
  <text start="957.75" dur="4.2">a guy in Australia named dr. noon ham</text>
  <text start="959.58" dur="3.78">and he was and I&amp;#39;m gonna use his words</text>
  <text start="961.95" dur="3.18">here not mine because I don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="963.36" dur="3.36">claims or or give advice or any of that</text>
  <text start="965.13" dur="5.01">any of my disclaimers I don&amp;#39;t wanna get</text>
  <text start="966.72" dur="6.89">my door kickin he was curing arthritis</text>
  <text start="970.14" dur="6">and osteoporosis and basically</text>
  <text start="973.61" dur="4.36">eliminating a lot of the bone problems</text>
  <text start="976.14" dur="3.57">especially older women get like hip</text>
  <text start="977.97" dur="3.96">fractures that kind of thing which is</text>
  <text start="979.71" dur="4.26">like a third of the value that the the</text>
  <text start="981.93" dur="3.93">profit of the big pharma industry comes</text>
  <text start="983.97" dur="4.74">from these hospitalizations and these</text>
  <text start="985.86" dur="7.23">pills and-and-and bone problems like</text>
  <text start="988.71" dur="6.9">that that&amp;#39;s one one thing from boron is</text>
  <text start="993.09" dur="4.44">the bone aspect I got into it because I</text>
  <text start="995.61" dur="3.42">was having some dental issues cuz my</text>
  <text start="997.53" dur="3.69">parents gave me a bunch of candy as a</text>
  <text start="999.03" dur="6.09">kid and I&amp;#39;m trying to heal my dental</text>
  <text start="1001.22" dur="5.34">enamel and there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="1005.12" dur="3.02">things to do with that as well including</text>
  <text start="1006.56" dur="5.49">magnesium because that&amp;#39;s good for bones</text>
  <text start="1008.14" dur="7.81">but boron is powerful in many ways it</text>
  <text start="1012.05" dur="7.26">also has kind of a a neuro protective</text>
  <text start="1015.95" dur="5.22">effect it&amp;#39;s good for the brain you know</text>
  <text start="1019.31" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s good for the stress and stuff like</text>
  <text start="1021.17" dur="5.19">that it has many different great things</text>
  <text start="1022.88" dur="5.459">about it or acts is just a cheap way to</text>
  <text start="1026.36" dur="7.2">get boron it&amp;#39;s considered to be safer</text>
  <text start="1028.339" dur="9.451">than salt on the toxicity chart there</text>
  <text start="1033.56" dur="5.43">are you know with borax you can take a</text>
  <text start="1037.79" dur="3.299">little bit and put it in a glass of</text>
  <text start="1038.99" dur="4.44">water drink that or whatever I you just</text>
  <text start="1041.089" dur="4.471">make a big you know I use a big liquor</text>
  <text start="1043.43" dur="4.5">bottle and I just make us a big solution</text>
  <text start="1045.56" dur="4.86">strength of it and then I take a shot of</text>
  <text start="1047.93" dur="5.31">that every day doesn&amp;#39;t taste great but</text>
  <text start="1050.42" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;ll mix that end with a glass of water</text>
  <text start="1053.24" dur="2.94">so those things right there you&amp;#39;ve just</text>
  <text start="1054.83" dur="3.45">gotten rid of so many deficiencies</text>
  <text start="1056.18" dur="4.26">you&amp;#39;ve gotten you&amp;#39;ve just helped with</text>
  <text start="1058.28" dur="4.47">bone problems like arthritis and and</text>
  <text start="1060.44" dur="5.31">osteoporosis you&amp;#39;ve you&amp;#39;ve helped maybe</text>
  <text start="1062.75" dur="5.85">to prevent hip fractures and things like</text>
  <text start="1065.75" dur="5.07">that broken bones possibly</text>
  <text start="1068.6" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;ve balanced a lot of your systems</text>
  <text start="1070.82" dur="5.36">iodine is really important for thyroid</text>

  <text start="1083.48" dur="17.85">deals there and that&amp;#39;s just talking</text>
  <text start="1087.44" dur="16.26">deficiencies you know I really I hole my</text>
  <text start="1101.33" dur="7.37">conception of what the human body</text>
  <text start="1103.7" dur="5">actually was when I started fasting I</text>
  <text start="1109.12" dur="7.87">began to realize it&amp;#39;s more like a gas to</text>
  <text start="1112.96" dur="7.03">system when we breathe in air it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1116.99" dur="6.12">a tube system when we&amp;#39;re eating all this</text>
  <text start="1119.99" dur="6.45">crap that they&amp;#39;re putting out there you</text>
  <text start="1123.11" dur="4.89">know when I after I started fasting the</text>
  <text start="1126.44" dur="3.3">only thing that looked like food when I</text>
  <text start="1128" dur="4.65">walked into the grocery store was the</text>
  <text start="1129.74" dur="11.19">produce section I fit this all this food</text>
  <text start="1132.65" dur="9.33">nothing not even like just not really</text>
  <text start="1140.93" dur="3.24">meant to eat</text>
  <text start="1141.98" dur="8.7">oh it&amp;#39;s kibble like dog kibble it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1144.17" dur="7.92">really fit for food aesthetically was</text>
  <text start="1150.68" dur="4.68">repulsed by it</text>
  <text start="1152.09" dur="4.38">I no longer looked at it as food and of</text>
  <text start="1155.36" dur="3.06">course when you get back in the</text>
  <text start="1156.47" dur="3.66">workforce and you start working and then</text>
  <text start="1158.42" dur="3.84">you got a take you know some Quaker</text>
  <text start="1160.13" dur="4.05">Oatmeal or something and then it grows</text>
  <text start="1162.26" dur="4.2">from there you start to integrate these</text>
  <text start="1164.18" dur="4.71">some of these things back in but even at</text>
  <text start="1166.46" dur="5.91">my worst I&amp;#39;m not as bad as most people</text>
  <text start="1168.89" dur="5.85">are because I see people going down</text>
  <text start="1172.37" dur="5.01">these aisles and doing all their</text>
  <text start="1174.74" dur="4.83">shopping they barely go into the produce</text>
  <text start="1177.38" dur="3.78">section and even if you go into the</text>
  <text start="1179.57" dur="4.22">produce section of some of these stores</text>
  <text start="1181.16" dur="4.38">like winn-dixie and these big chains</text>
  <text start="1183.79" dur="3.82">everything shrink-wrapped</text>
  <text start="1185.54" dur="4.47">you know it&amp;#39;s got plastic all over it</text>
  <text start="1187.61" dur="3.99">how much of that is being absorbed we</text>
  <text start="1190.01" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t know what chemicals were sprayed</text>
  <text start="1191.6" dur="5.34">on these produce so they&amp;#39;ve really</text>
  <text start="1193.7" dur="7.08">created a world where it&amp;#39;s very hard for</text>

  <text start="1201.85" dur="7.89">of our systems crap our whole digestive</text>
  <text start="1207.22" dur="4.29">system I think that&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="1209.74" dur="3.57">deficiencies come first of all we&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="1228.16" dur="6.51">there&amp;#39;s a battle raging inside of our</text>
  <text start="1230.74" dur="5.94">bodies chemically and I kind of when I</text>
  <text start="1234.67" dur="7.4">started fasting I started visioning the</text>

  <text start="2112.03" dur="8.54">I mean I was jacked up on sugar 24/7</text>
  <text start="2116.85" dur="6.31">when I was growing up kool-aid my</text>
  <text start="2120.57" dur="4.48">grandparents used it to spoil me and my</text>
  <text start="2123.16" dur="5.07">parents used it to shut me up because I</text>
  <text start="2125.05" dur="5.55">was a hyperactive kid so I mean I I had</text>
  <text start="2128.23" dur="3.96">eight fillings with the mercury amalgams</text>
  <text start="2130.6" dur="4.77">in there and just spilling mercury into</text>
  <text start="2132.19" dur="5.01">my body by the time I was a adult you</text>
  <text start="2135.37" dur="3.27">know and that&amp;#39;s plagued me my whole life</text>
  <text start="2137.2" dur="3.78">now I got rid of all</text>
  <text start="2138.64" dur="4.59">the fillings I got the ceramic put in I</text>
  <text start="2140.98" dur="3.569">lost a tooth over it like it died so I</text>
  <text start="2143.23" dur="3.359">had it root come out and then I realized</text>
  <text start="2144.549" dur="4.081">that root canal teeth are rotting organ</text>
  <text start="2146.589" dur="3.27">in your body just dumping bacteria and</text>
  <text start="2148.63" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re linked to heart attacks and</text>
  <text start="2149.859" dur="3.66">stuff so I got that pulled and then I</text>
  <text start="2152.2" dur="3.419">couldn&amp;#39;t afford to get the bridge so I</text>
  <text start="2153.519" dur="3.361">had my teeth start shifting and then now</text>
  <text start="2155.619" dur="2.791">they&amp;#39;re kind of chipping on each other</text>
  <text start="2156.88" dur="3.989">so then I started to learn about how to</text>
  <text start="2158.41" dur="4.439">heal your enamel which is it works for</text>
  <text start="2160.869" dur="4.261">me because of my dog practice tooth you</text>
  <text start="2162.849" dur="3.27">can see a fracture up the whole thing he</text>
  <text start="2165.13" dur="4.739">kind of bought me in the head were</text>
  <text start="2166.119" dur="5.67">roughhousing he didn&amp;#39;t mean to but it</text>
  <text start="2169.869" dur="3.96">hurt for a while and then doing the</text>
  <text start="2171.789" dur="4.471">things I&amp;#39;m doing with the vitamin k2 the</text>
  <text start="2173.829" dur="4.921">magnesium the calcium the vitamin D</text>
  <text start="2176.26" dur="4.049">those are all important for each other</text>
  <text start="2178.75" dur="3.75">but you can&amp;#39;t take them at the same time</text>
  <text start="2180.309" dur="4.141">because they blocked each other so</text>
  <text start="2182.5" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s synergists and antagonists which</text>
  <text start="2184.45" dur="4.069">is very confusing yeah but you take all</text>
  <text start="2186.67" dur="3.899">of those in the right amounts together I</text>
  <text start="2188.519" dur="5.77">just spaced them out throughout the day</text>
  <text start="2190.569" dur="6.121">or you know stagger them plus the boron</text>
  <text start="2194.289" dur="6.06">helps I think a lot with the dental and</text>
  <text start="2196.69" dur="5.55">the bone stuff and I was able to heal</text>
  <text start="2200.349" dur="4.141">the enamel the pain went away the the</text>
  <text start="2202.24" dur="4.98">fracture is gone I can&amp;#39;t see it anymore</text>
  <text start="2204.49" dur="4.14">so some people anything that&amp;#39;s possible</text>
  <text start="2207.22" dur="17.28">at first I didn&amp;#39;t even realize that you</text>
  <text start="2208.63" dur="27.12">could heal dental enamel gotta stop</text>
  <text start="2224.5" dur="13.559">sugar that&amp;#39;s the biggie I mean they</text>
  <text start="2235.75" dur="5.94">really are trying to kill us any way</text>
  <text start="2238.059" dur="7.55">they can and generate businesses you</text>
  <text start="2241.69" dur="6.99">know it&amp;#39;s big money to make you sick and</text>
  <text start="2245.609" dur="5.7">you know every single drug that they</text>

  <text start="2259.66" dur="5.58">pop up the side effects are always worse</text>
  <text start="2262.15" dur="4.469">than the natural foods and in every case</text>
  <text start="2265.24" dur="2.91">that I&amp;#39;ve ever seen there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="2266.619" dur="4.351">something natural that works better or</text>
  <text start="2268.15" dur="3.87">will work in place without the side</text>
  <text start="2270.97" dur="3">effects</text>
  <text start="2272.02" dur="3.75">you just have to do more research and</text>
  <text start="2273.97" dur="4.35">people want that fast instant</text>
  <text start="2275.77" dur="4.32">gratification pill for every ill Society</text>

  <text start="2281.5" dur="5.19">evil system to make you sicker and then</text>
  <text start="2284.86" dur="3.54">those doctors are never going to change</text>

  <text start="2288.4" dur="2.91">years of researching this crap and they</text>
  <text start="2289.87" dur="3.33">actually believe it</text>
  <text start="2291.31" dur="5.21">trust me I&amp;#39;ve debated quite a few of</text>
  <text start="2293.2" dur="3.32">them and they won&amp;#39;t change their mind</text>
  <text start="2298.77" dur="7.75">and I&amp;#39;ll have to admit that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2300.64" dur="8.04">hurting thousands of people they&amp;#39;ve gone</text>

  <text start="2414.849" dur="7.081">mucus was clogging up our systems and it</text>
  <text start="2419.109" dur="4.531">was based the basis of all disease now</text>
  <text start="2421.93" dur="3.3">we probably have more than that now</text>
  <text start="2423.64" dur="6.06">because of all the technology and</text>

  <text start="3291.81" dur="7.68">oh I can&amp;#39;t you too much protein is bad</text>
  <text start="3297" dur="4.95">for you meat is either good or bad</text>
  <text start="3299.49" dur="4.35">because most meats are processed full of</text>
  <text start="3301.95" dur="3.57">chemicals full of hormones and they fed</text>
  <text start="3303.84" dur="3.12">them complete crap that they&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="3336.42" dur="7.83">but also tobacco you know and that kind</text>
  <text start="3339.45" dur="7.95">of thing but meat even he said that the</text>

  <text start="3374.16" dur="5.699">in 57 or something they killed him</text>
  <text start="3377.88" dur="7.35">I continue to believe that they killed</text>
  <text start="3379.859" dur="8.341">him but all of his experience was during</text>
  <text start="3385.23" dur="4.8">the 30s and the 20s he did all this</text>
  <text start="3388.2" dur="7.95">stuff which was kind of unheard of</text>
  <text start="3390.03" dur="9.99">mm-hmm putting as much in the food they</text>
  <text start="3396.15" dur="6.51">it wasn&amp;#39;t as gross as it is now as fake</text>

  <text start="3420.93" dur="6.45">yep what we&amp;#39;ve been eating well I I</text>
  <text start="3425.31" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t even know fill that it all out as</text>
  <text start="3427.38" dur="3.36">a public thing because it would just set</text>
  <text start="3429.18" dur="2.669">the government up for so much liability</text>
  <text start="3430.74" dur="2.52">that it would it would break the</text>

  <text start="3465.96" dur="6.87">against the law and listening about to</text>
  <text start="3471.3" dur="4.74">this nun talk about this nanotechnology</text>
  <text start="3472.83" dur="5.43">that they&amp;#39;re putting in our food so they</text>
  <text start="3476.04" dur="4.19">can turn us into a eyes she says they</text>
  <text start="3478.26" dur="5.46">don&amp;#39;t have to put that on the label that</text>
  <text start="3480.23" dur="5.53">it&amp;#39;s not these you know technologies and</text>
  <text start="3483.72" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re trying to pass a law right now</text>
  <text start="3485.76" dur="4.11">where they have to at least show us</text>

  <text start="3489.87" dur="5.16">two of the big ones that are using this</text>
  <text start="3491.94" dur="9.21">nanotechnology she was reading from a</text>
  <text start="3495.03" dur="8.28">report that said that the success of the</text>
  <text start="3501.15" dur="4.08">nanotechnology meaning how many people</text>
  <text start="3503.31" dur="4.29">were infested with this stuff was</text>
  <text start="3505.23" dur="3.99">ninety-seven percent of the food or</text>
  <text start="3507.6" dur="7.29">something that the Americans are eating</text>
  <text start="3509.22" dur="9.03">and they felt like they needed to up it</text>
  <text start="3514.89" dur="6.03">you know to be more successful in with a</text>
  <text start="3518.25" dur="4.59">vaccine they did that tear yeah they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3520.92" dur="8">actively trying to kill us</text>
  <text start="3522.84" dur="8.4">yeah and all this comes from a law</text>
  <text start="3528.92" dur="5.14">something that happened Franklin Delano</text>
  <text start="3531.24" dur="3.69">Roosevelt did this she explains it</text>
  <text start="3534.06" dur="10.56">better than I can</text>
  <text start="3534.93" dur="14.67">but in effect in 1933 we became bounty</text>
  <text start="3544.62" dur="6.78">for more I&amp;#39;ll send you the link and you</text>
  <text start="3549.6" dur="4.05">can watch this video what she says</text>

  <text start="3553.65" dur="4.59">interesting she gets technically into it</text>
  <text start="3556.47" dur="5.16">she&amp;#39;s got the government papers that</text>
  <text start="3558.24" dur="4.83">describe what they&amp;#39;re doing and you</text>
  <text start="3561.63" dur="2.94">probably would understand it a little</text>
  <text start="3563.07" dur="4.46">bit better than I do all I know is</text>
  <text start="3564.57" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re raining down these this this</text>
  <text start="3567.53" dur="5.95">bacteria that gets into our body and</text>
  <text start="3570.69" dur="6">then grows and multiplies and it helps</text>
  <text start="3573.48" dur="5.58">with this nanotechnology community it</text>
  <text start="3576.69" dur="4.65">helps them with it interacts with the</text>
  <text start="3579.06" dur="4.98">satellites and interacts with a lot of</text>
  <text start="3581.34" dur="4.8">things but one of the things is these</text>
  <text start="3584.04" dur="5.43">drones and satellites and things that</text>
  <text start="3586.14" dur="7.53">they want to put up there to control us</text>
  <text start="3589.47" dur="6.69">like robots I know a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="3593.67" dur="4.95">saying yeah</text>
  <text start="3596.16" dur="11.64">there&amp;#39;s Morgellons there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="3598.62" dur="10.68">Nano things I saw today there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="3607.8" dur="3.36">disinfo out there about some of that</text>
  <text start="3609.3" dur="3.6">seat like nano stuff though because some</text>
  <text start="3611.16" dur="2.4">people say c60 is one of those things</text>
  <text start="3612.9" dur="4.2">that they&amp;#39;re going to use to</text>
  <text start="3613.56" dur="6.86">mind-control you and in it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3617.1" dur="5.4">a machine it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a molecule but</text>
  <text start="3620.42" dur="4.09">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people out there who</text>
  <text start="3622.5" dur="3.81">come at it from that perspective of</text>
  <text start="3624.51" dur="3.45">everything they&amp;#39;re putting in you some</text>
  <text start="3626.31" dur="3.84">people even say colloidal silver for</text>
  <text start="3627.96" dur="3.18">example is gonna be used to mind-control</text>
  <text start="3630.15" dur="3.9">you and things like that</text>
  <text start="3631.14" dur="4.08">meaning metal so there&amp;#39;s some people who</text>
  <text start="3634.05" dur="4.46">just have no idea what they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="3635.22" dur="3.29">about when it comes to that and stuff</text>
  <text start="3640.46" dur="5.59">yeah all days the technology is there</text>
  <text start="3644.73" dur="2.67">they&amp;#39;re trying to put they they put it</text>
  <text start="3646.05" dur="3.09">in some of the pills now where they can</text>
  <text start="3647.4" dur="5.07">tell you when to take the next one</text>
  <text start="3649.14" dur="4.83">things like that so yeah they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3652.47" dur="2.94">definitely putting that stuff out there</text>
  <text start="3653.97" dur="4.44">but there&amp;#39;s a lot of disinfo out there</text>
  <text start="3655.41" dur="4.59">about that one I did a whole a whole</text>
  <text start="3658.41" dur="3.06">video we don&amp;#39;t have to go through it all</text>
  <text start="3660" dur="4.29">again but I did a whole video about all</text>
  <text start="3661.47" dur="4.65">the supplements I take so I hit the the</text>
  <text start="3664.29" dur="4.28">deficiency stuff today and I gave a</text>
  <text start="3666.12" dur="5.42">couple like cacao and things like that</text>
  <text start="3668.57" dur="5.32">there&amp;#39;s also the detox side of things</text>
  <text start="3671.54" dur="4.57">there&amp;#39;s the chelation side of things</text>
  <text start="3673.89" dur="3.54">like chelating on heavy metals I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="3676.11" dur="3.9">a lot of things to talk them out there</text>
  <text start="3677.43" dur="4.49">but it is dangerous to do too fast or if</text>
  <text start="3680.01" dur="4.23">you don&amp;#39;t support the body the right way</text>
  <text start="3681.92" dur="4.09">so I always I send people to the</text>
  <text start="3684.24" dur="3.54">research and tell them to look at</text>
  <text start="3686.01" dur="3.18">everything first like read the whole</text>
  <text start="3687.78" dur="3.06">page watch every video listen every</text>
  <text start="3689.19" dur="5.58">interview first before you start doing</text>
  <text start="3690.84" dur="6.57">like chelation because we all have heavy</text>
  <text start="3694.77" dur="5.21">metal toxicity led or or I have a lot of</text>
  <text start="3697.41" dur="5.88">mercury from the dental amalgams I had</text>
  <text start="3699.98" dur="5.38">and then there&amp;#39;s also the herbalism side</text>
  <text start="3703.29" dur="5.37">of things different herbs that you can</text>
  <text start="3705.36" dur="7.83">take that are natural medicines or deal</text>
  <text start="3708.66" dur="6.96">with certain conditions like camu camu</text>
  <text start="3713.19" dur="5.94">say 50 to 60 times more vitamin C than</text>

  <text start="3735.24" dur="4.74">in babies otherwise there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="3738.599" dur="3.45">other things to talk about it I want to</text>
  <text start="3739.98" dur="4.529">do a video on my microgreen setup at one</text>

  <text start="4047.06" dur="5.52">then they did a rat studies of GMO foods</text>
  <text start="4050.51" dur="4.02">and animals won&amp;#39;t eat GMO if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4052.58" dur="4.56">given another choice there was a study</text>
  <text start="4054.53" dur="5.7">where somebody left a big bag of corn</text>

  <text start="4060.23" dur="4.2">corn was not even touched but rats a</text>

  <text start="4064.43" dur="4.38">control studies where they had nothing</text>
  <text start="4066.08" dur="4.47">else to eat the first generation of rats</text>
  <text start="4068.81" dur="3.54">would get sick in cancer the second</text>
  <text start="4070.55" dur="4.26">generation of rats would be low</text>
  <text start="4072.35" dur="4.55">birthweight have two massive tumors like</text>
  <text start="4074.81" dur="4.53">bigger than their body they would get</text>
  <text start="4076.9" dur="5.11">you know various symptoms and diseases</text>

  <text start="4089.39" dur="3.66">growing inside of their mouths things</text>
  <text start="4090.83" dur="5.73">like that so these things are causing</text>
  <text start="4093.05" dur="4.86">some massive mutation and fasting is</text>
  <text start="4096.56" dur="3.68">actually pretty strong for that because</text>
  <text start="4097.91" dur="5.22">your it&amp;#39;ll tell your body to start</text>
  <text start="4100.24" dur="5.17">taking all of those sick cells and it</text>
  <text start="4103.13" dur="4.02">will eat them and create healthy new</text>
  <text start="4105.41" dur="3.8">cells and that&amp;#39;s a hard thing to get</text>
  <text start="4107.15" dur="6.27">into apoptosis I think it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="4109.21" dur="10.33">before you actually go on a fast it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4113.42" dur="9.3">difficult to get that reaction that</text>
  <text start="4119.54" dur="6.39">scare people about fasting is that you</text>
  <text start="4122.72" dur="5.53">start to feel sick you know and what you</text>
  <text start="4125.93" dur="4.57">have to remember is</text>
  <text start="4128.25" dur="4.77">a lot of these foods are addictive and</text>
  <text start="4130.5" dur="4.7">you can compare it to a drug addiction</text>
  <text start="4133.02" dur="5.46">you know where heroin addict stops</text>
  <text start="4135.2" dur="6.28">taking heroin well they have to get sick</text>
  <text start="4138.48" dur="6.27">to get all the residues of that drug</text>
  <text start="4141.48" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s all that is bad it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4144.75" dur="4.049">uncomfortable it doesn&amp;#39;t feel good you</text>
  <text start="4146.91" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t feel good you have to pamper</text>
  <text start="4148.799" dur="4.5">yourself all different kinds of ways</text>
  <text start="4150.96" dur="5.43">when you&amp;#39;re fasting but that you give</text>
  <text start="4153.299" dur="4.951">yourself permission to do that</text>
  <text start="4156.39" dur="3.27">you know do whatever you have to do to</text>
  <text start="4158.25" dur="3.66">make yourself feel better go to sleep</text>
  <text start="4159.66" dur="4.409">take a nap sit in the bed don&amp;#39;t you know</text>
  <text start="4161.91" dur="5.34">do whatever you want to do pamper</text>
  <text start="4164.069" dur="6.841">yourself but just realize once that</text>
  <text start="4167.25" dur="5.94">passes once you get that goes through</text>
  <text start="4170.91" dur="4.5">your bloodstream and through your</text>
  <text start="4173.19" dur="5.37">intestines and your kidneys and wherever</text>
  <text start="4175.41" dur="5.97">it has to go that you are gonna start to</text>
  <text start="4178.56" dur="7.5">feel so much better after that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4181.38" dur="6.3">worth it to go through withdrawal before</text>
  <text start="4186.06" dur="3.84">they start feeling better and it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="4187.68" dur="7.26">same exact principle when you&amp;#39;re fasting</text>
  <text start="4189.9" dur="7.92">you&amp;#39;re not dying or anything yeah you</text>
  <text start="4194.94" dur="4.68">know with fasting is funny because after</text>
  <text start="4197.82" dur="6.21">day 3 the hunger goes away for most</text>
  <text start="4199.62" dur="6.18">people yeah and the sickness you know</text>
  <text start="4204.03" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s probably gone at that point as well</text>
  <text start="4205.8" dur="12.69">but those first 3 days are pretty</text>
  <text start="4207.69" dur="14.1">miserable willing to this is about</text>
  <text start="4218.49" dur="5.85">scientific as I get but yeah no you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4221.79" dur="4.86">not you know to aid that process with</text>
  <text start="4224.34" dur="5.55">the things that you know work you know</text>
  <text start="4226.65" dur="6.33">such as you got a little bit of citrus</text>
  <text start="4229.89" dur="5.49">something in your water because that</text>
  <text start="4232.98" dur="4.68">acts as a cleansing agent you know helps</text>
  <text start="4235.38" dur="4.47">loosen up all that stuff you can drink a</text>
  <text start="4237.66" dur="5.07">whole bunch of water and not get as much</text>
  <text start="4239.85" dur="5.34">flush your body out if you just put a</text>
  <text start="4242.73" dur="4.53">little bit of lemon juice in there you</text>
  <text start="4245.19" dur="9.05">know so all that stuff becomes super</text>
  <text start="4247.26" dur="9.63">important that there&amp;#39;s a vinegar 1/2 age</text>
  <text start="4254.24" dur="4.63">yeah you want to avoid calories if you</text>
  <text start="4256.89" dur="5.07">can and there&amp;#39;s also something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4258.87" dur="4.26">probably easier for people to</text>
  <text start="4261.96" dur="4.47">some of the benefits call it</text>
  <text start="4263.13" dur="5.7">intermittent fasting where you eat for</text>
  <text start="4266.43" dur="4.53">only within like ideally a six to eight</text>
  <text start="4268.83" dur="3.57">hour window but at most a ten hour</text>
  <text start="4270.96" dur="2.759">window a day you can still have three</text>
  <text start="4272.4" dur="3.9">meals but it has to be within that</text>
  <text start="4273.719" dur="4.531">window so that you actually go longer</text>
  <text start="4276.3" dur="3.48">and get out of the the insulin</text>
  <text start="4278.25" dur="3.93">everything else that your body&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="4279.78" dur="3.54">through during those other hours and</text>
  <text start="4282.18" dur="12.9">then you start to get some of the</text>
  <text start="4283.32" dur="15.06">fasting effects before you eat again is</text>
  <text start="4295.08" dur="10.28">fast because they call breakfast it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4298.38" dur="11.81">break shops yeah you haven&amp;#39;t really been</text>
  <text start="4305.36" dur="7.96">tempted by anything when you wake up</text>
  <text start="4310.19" dur="6.279">it&amp;#39;s already small and it starts to</text>
  <text start="4313.32" dur="5.01">squeeze and like you say the first day</text>
  <text start="4316.469" dur="4.111">you really feel that but towards about</text>
  <text start="4318.33" dur="4.53">the end of the second day you don&amp;#39;t feel</text>
  <text start="4320.58" dur="5.67">it anymore you&amp;#39;re not even really hungry</text>
  <text start="4322.86" dur="7.05">I will even add to this we didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="4326.25" dur="6.84">touch on liposomal which are amazing but</text>
  <text start="4329.91" dur="6">pets dogs for example benefit greatly</text>
  <text start="4333.09" dur="5.58">from reduced caloric intake because in</text>
  <text start="4335.91" dur="3.329">the wild wolves go for periods of time</text>
  <text start="4338.67" dur="2.819">without eating</text>
  <text start="4339.239" dur="3.601">they actually have fasting so you can</text>
  <text start="4341.489" dur="3.991">actually help your dog a lot by feeding</text>
  <text start="4342.84" dur="5.52">them a lot less they&amp;#39;re not a fan of it</text>
  <text start="4345.48" dur="8.37">but they&amp;#39;re their health will get much</text>
  <text start="4348.36" dur="6.21">better and I also get my dogs iodine and</text>
  <text start="4353.85" dur="2.94">magnesium</text>
  <text start="4354.57" dur="3.8">because most mammals need that and</text>
  <text start="4356.79" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re deficient I give my rabbits</text>
  <text start="4358.37" dur="4.96">iodine I put it in their water as a</text>
  <text start="4361.02" dur="4.41">disinfectant but even my rabbits get</text>
  <text start="4363.33" dur="4.35">iodine and pretty much every mammal</text>
  <text start="4365.43" dur="9.539">needs it and it&amp;#39;s so cheap</text>
  <text start="4367.68" dur="9.24">the DIY yeah yeah you would only want</text>
  <text start="4374.969" dur="5.221">like a little one drop it and a whole</text>
  <text start="4376.92" dur="13.799">thing of water for a tiny dog but I mean</text>
  <text start="4380.19" dur="12.69">a minor 30 all dogs are as deficient if</text>
  <text start="4390.719" dur="4.981">not more in iodine and magnesium as</text>
  <text start="4392.88" dur="5.339">their humans well</text>
  <text start="4395.7" dur="5.16">if they put all that garbage in our food</text>
  <text start="4398.219" dur="5.161">and we have taste buds and we have more</text>
  <text start="4400.86" dur="4.14">discernment than dogs they get the crap</text>
  <text start="4403.38" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re putting into the dog</text>
  <text start="4405" dur="3.69">seriously dogs only eat that stuff</text>
  <text start="4406.89" dur="3.72">because they&amp;#39;re starving they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4408.69" dur="5.34">touch that stuff otherwise all of those</text>

  <text start="4924.59" dur="4.47">have a lot of emotion on this topic but</text>
  <text start="4927.14" dur="2.83">they&amp;#39;ve shown that if you if you it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="4929.06" dur="2.38">lot more work but if you</text>
