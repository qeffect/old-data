  <text start="9.75" dur="7.999">by the most powerful force that is</text>
  <text start="28.78" dur="4.93">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="31.28" dur="4.14">most of the Nemo&amp;#39;s news network and I am</text>
  <text start="33.71" dur="4.44">joined by a very special guest</text>
  <text start="35.42" dur="4.86">Gregory Mannarino of traders choice net</text>
  <text start="38.15" dur="4.8">and he&amp;#39;s known as kind of the Robin Hood</text>
  <text start="40.28" dur="4.5">of Wall Street and I want to bring him</text>
  <text start="42.95" dur="3.179">on to sort of and I&amp;#39;ll let him introduce</text>
  <text start="44.78" dur="2.94">himself in a minute and he has an</text>
  <text start="46.129" dur="4.201">extensive history he&amp;#39;s got a really good</text>
  <text start="47.72" dur="4.65">track record as well of kind of call in</text>
  <text start="50.33" dur="4.26">the markets but I&amp;#39;m here to have him</text>
  <text start="52.37" dur="4.11">warn you what&amp;#39;s coming in the markets so</text>
  <text start="54.59" dur="3.359">Greg thank you so much for taking the</text>
  <text start="56.48" dur="3.6">time we&amp;#39;re gonna keep it short I just</text>
  <text start="57.949" dur="3.631">want you to give everyone kind of a</text>
  <text start="60.08" dur="4.92">heads up so they don&amp;#39;t get surprised by</text>
  <text start="61.58" dur="5.97">this exactly the first of me here I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="65" dur="5.34">glad to be here thank you for the</text>
  <text start="67.55" dur="5.19">opportunity to I guess enlighten people</text>
  <text start="70.34" dur="4.65">as to what&amp;#39;s coming down the pike but I</text>
  <text start="72.74" dur="4.53">really believe that for the most part I</text>
  <text start="74.99" dur="5.6">think people are waking up to the</text>
  <text start="77.27" dur="7.65">situation around them to put this very</text>
  <text start="80.59" dur="5.83">basically and simple is we have I mean</text>
  <text start="84.92" dur="4.53">I&amp;#39;m a trader I&amp;#39;m a stock market guide</text>
  <text start="86.42" dur="6.299">this is all I do we have a stock market</text>
  <text start="89.45" dur="4.62">that has no bearing on reality at all we</text>
  <text start="92.719" dur="3.51">are in la-la land</text>
  <text start="94.07" dur="4.229">we&amp;#39;ve never been here before these</text>
  <text start="96.229" dur="6.541">distortions are greater than we have</text>
  <text start="98.299" dur="7.35">ever seen in in history and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="102.77" dur="5.279">going to be a moment of reckoning coming</text>
  <text start="105.649" dur="6.9">down the pike here and what I urge</text>
  <text start="108.049" dur="6.78">people to do is simply follow the action</text>
  <text start="112.549" dur="5.191">not the stock market okay I&amp;#39;m a stock</text>
  <text start="114.829" dur="5.22">market guy yes but where does the stock</text>
  <text start="117.74" dur="4.68">market or every single asset get its</text>
  <text start="120.049" dur="4.71">value from well it&amp;#39;s very simple it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.42" dur="4.439">from the bond market or the debt market</text>
  <text start="124.759" dur="4.351">which eclipses the stock market by</text>
  <text start="126.859" dur="6.661">exponents by following the bond market</text>
  <text start="129.11" dur="5.97">you can have a very good idea of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="133.52" dur="3.81">coming down the pike now we&amp;#39;ve had an</text>
  <text start="135.08" dur="4.62">inverted yield curve for quite a long</text>
  <text start="137.33" dur="6.239">time we&amp;#39;re about to see or we&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="139.7" dur="8.369">threshold of a major two-year ten-year</text>
  <text start="143.569" dur="6.091">inversion now this is a big deal because</text>
  <text start="148.069" dur="5.221">every time it has happened in the past</text>
  <text start="149.66" dur="7.32">we&amp;#39;ve seen market crashes meltdowns</text>
  <text start="153.29" dur="4.88">depressions occur we have a spread</text>
  <text start="156.98" dur="4.46">between the two</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="5.31">here and the tenure of about 12 basis</text>
  <text start="161.44" dur="4.08">points what people need to understand is</text>
  <text start="163.48" dur="4.02">this this can happen in a matter of days</text>
  <text start="165.52" dur="4.02">now that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean that</text>
  <text start="167.5" dur="3.78">stocks are gonna sell off when we get</text>
  <text start="169.54" dur="5.4">the inversion if history is a guide</text>
  <text start="171.28" dur="4.92">there was a lag time however we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="174.94" dur="3.33">been here before</text>
  <text start="176.2" dur="5.49">this is where no man a woman has gone</text>
  <text start="178.27" dur="6.45">before and these discussions are greater</text>
  <text start="181.69" dur="6.03">than we&amp;#39;ve ever seen so I mean it sucks</text>
  <text start="184.72" dur="5.31">to watch what&amp;#39;s going on here sorry I</text>
  <text start="187.72" dur="6.18">would say kind of worse than oh wait</text>
  <text start="190.03" dur="5.55">probably fair to say well let me put a</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="4.68">perspective on that so if you were to</text>
  <text start="195.58" dur="6.18">take every single meltdown from 2008</text>
  <text start="198.58" dur="7.26">going back to the 1929 crash put them</text>
  <text start="201.76" dur="5.4">together one as in one craft and look at</text>
  <text start="205.84" dur="4.26">the next one coming this is gonna</text>
  <text start="207.16" dur="5.31">eclipse all of them combined because we</text>
  <text start="210.1" dur="5.79">have never seen what we&amp;#39;re witnessing</text>
  <text start="212.47" dur="7.349">now in the markets before we are caught</text>
  <text start="215.89" dur="5.76">in a global debt vortex like we have</text>
  <text start="219.819" dur="4.2">never seen before in the history of the</text>
  <text start="221.65" dur="4.619">world in every single world leader every</text>
  <text start="224.019" dur="5.271">president every leader of their country</text>
  <text start="226.269" dur="5.071">is playing the game the debt game of</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="5.14">asking for their central banks to</text>
  <text start="231.34" dur="5.79">continue to flood the markets with easy</text>
  <text start="234.43" dur="6.899">money to suppress interest rates this is</text>
  <text start="237.13" dur="6.21">a theft mechanism on a grand scale it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.329" dur="4.111">forcing the middle class to subsidize</text>
  <text start="243.34" dur="4.44">the entire stock market now we&amp;#39;re about</text>
  <text start="245.44" dur="5.419">to see there&amp;#39;s a new phase coming up the</text>
  <text start="247.78" dur="5.79">new phase is massive dollar devaluation</text>
  <text start="250.859" dur="5.081">trying to just just devalue their</text>
  <text start="253.57" dur="5.61">currency the president&amp;#39;s point for the</text>
  <text start="255.94" dur="6.15">Fed to watch what the Fed what the China</text>
  <text start="259.18" dur="6.06">central bank is doing meaning humans the</text>
  <text start="262.09" dur="4.38">current our currency to be devalued as</text>
  <text start="265.24" dur="2.52">well it&amp;#39;s something he&amp;#39;s been talking</text>
  <text start="266.47" dur="3.96">about for the longest time he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="267.76" dur="4.83">like the strong dollar and he believes</text>
  <text start="270.43" dur="4.65">the way out of this I guess it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="272.59" dur="5.19">lower interest rates oldest is doing is</text>
  <text start="275.08" dur="4.44">fueling the debt monster the more debt</text>
  <text start="277.78" dur="3.48">introduced into the system the stronger</text>
  <text start="279.52" dur="4.05">the federal reserve becomes people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="281.26" dur="4.89">understand this but debt is the Federal</text>
  <text start="283.57" dur="4.26">Reserve&amp;#39;s only product period the more</text>
  <text start="286.15" dur="4.59">debt they issue the stronger they become</text>
  <text start="287.83" dur="4.049">and this is all being borne on the back</text>
  <text start="290.74" dur="2.669">of the middle</text>
  <text start="291.879" dur="3.72">class again who&amp;#39;s been forced to</text>
  <text start="293.409" dur="4.05">subsidize this stock market for an</text>
  <text start="295.599" dur="5.31">entire decade right now being robbed</text>
  <text start="297.459" dur="5.82">blind by not having a there interesting</text>
  <text start="300.909" dur="3.421">accounts earn a rate of interest that</text>
  <text start="303.279" dur="3.69">would keep up with the rate of inflation</text>
  <text start="304.33" dur="5.099">again we&amp;#39;re getting more calls for tilt</text>
  <text start="306.969" dur="6.84">to lower rates here and I&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="309.429" dur="7.621">this the first guy to do this to stop</text>
  <text start="313.809" dur="5.85">playing that game wins and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.05" dur="4.019">nobody at this present time no one is</text>
  <text start="319.659" dur="3">looking to do it they&amp;#39;re all playing did</text>
  <text start="321.069" dur="3.24">that game they don&amp;#39;t know another way</text>
  <text start="322.659" dur="4.38">out of it the middle class is being</text>
  <text start="324.309" dur="4.771">decimated one in four people borrowing</text>
  <text start="327.039" dur="5.4">for the credit cards just to get by</text>
  <text start="329.08" dur="5.91">today we have a personal debt household</text>
  <text start="332.439" dur="4.77">debt at record highs I mean it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="334.99" dur="5.069">terrible situation then again we got the</text>
  <text start="337.209" dur="4.92">the yield curve which is screaming at us</text>
  <text start="340.059" dur="3.75">I mean it&amp;#39;s bright red I used to tell</text>
  <text start="342.129" dur="4.02">people with flashing red it is now</text>
  <text start="343.809" dur="4.95">bright red and it&amp;#39;s a steady red we got</text>
  <text start="346.149" dur="5.7">this 210 diversion it&amp;#39;s just imminent in</text>
  <text start="348.759" dur="5.34">my view we have a global slowdown our</text>
  <text start="351.849" dur="3.66">economy is in freefall here in the</text>
  <text start="354.099" dur="3.84">United States you&amp;#39;re not supposed to</text>
  <text start="355.509" dur="5.101">know that but if you were gonna look at</text>
  <text start="357.939" dur="4.2">manufacturing exports imports we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="360.61" dur="3.299">want to look at pre metric is pointing</text>
  <text start="362.139" dur="3.12">in the negative but we&amp;#39;re not supposed</text>
  <text start="363.909" dur="3.15">to know that either we&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="365.259" dur="3.99">look at the stock market near all-time</text>
  <text start="367.059" dur="3.871">highs ignore everything else we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="369.249" dur="3.54">supposed to believe that the</text>
  <text start="370.93" dur="3.989">unemployment numbers to give us our real</text>
  <text start="372.789" dur="5.641">they feed us the u3 which is the fake</text>
  <text start="374.919" dur="5.22">number the u6 is closer to the real</text>
  <text start="378.43" dur="4.439">number the actual one is about twice</text>
  <text start="380.139" dur="4.95">that so again we have we&amp;#39;re an</text>
  <text start="382.869" dur="4.59">environment of lies across the spectrum</text>
  <text start="385.089" dur="5.34">if we can cut through the nonsense and</text>
  <text start="387.459" dur="6.6">take the blinders off you can see very</text>
  <text start="390.429" dur="5.19">clearly as to where we are and and also</text>
  <text start="394.059" dur="3.36">put yourself in a position to protect</text>
  <text start="395.619" dur="4.08">yourself at least from a financial</text>
  <text start="397.419" dur="4.11">standpoint to a certain degree as this</text>
  <text start="399.699" dur="4.5">the next meltdown approaches and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.529" dur="4.56">coming do you think that gold and silver</text>
  <text start="404.199" dur="4.2">standard are gonna be the next thing</text>
  <text start="406.089" dur="4.98">that comes do you think these systems</text>
  <text start="408.399" dur="4.74">can even transfer from fiat to whatever</text>
  <text start="411.069" dur="3.27">it is that they have planned next well</text>
  <text start="413.139" dur="4.02">let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s put that into perspective</text>
  <text start="414.339" dur="4.95">real quick the power of world central</text>
  <text start="417.159" dur="4.831">banks exists in their ability to issue</text>
  <text start="419.289" dur="5.19">debt and I said that if one world leader</text>
  <text start="421.99" dur="3.68">had the guts and it could be done now in</text>
  <text start="424.479" dur="4.101">the United States by exactly</text>
  <text start="425.67" dur="4.74">order to revalue the price of gold ten</text>
  <text start="428.58" dur="4.05">times higher than it is right now and</text>
  <text start="430.41" dur="5.25">then back the dollar with a fraction of</text>
  <text start="432.63" dur="5.64">that goal today not tomorrow if the</text>
  <text start="435.66" dur="6">president were to do this we win now</text>
  <text start="438.27" dur="5.19">period it stops China in its tracks it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="441.66" dur="4.2">like hitting a wall a thousand miles an</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="5.88">hour but the stock market would take a</text>
  <text start="445.86" dur="5.52">substantial hit if this would happen I</text>
  <text start="449.34" dur="4.02">mean the moment this would be announced</text>
  <text start="451.38" dur="3.6">we would watch the Jones Industrial</text>
  <text start="453.36" dur="4.11">Average get cut in half if not worked</text>
  <text start="454.98" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s how that&amp;#39;s how it would play out</text>
  <text start="457.47" dur="4.8">at that point I do believe a new system</text>
  <text start="460.41" dur="4.35">is in the works but it will not in our</text>
  <text start="462.27" dur="4.38">favor it never is again the world</text>
  <text start="464.76" dur="4.71">central banks are running the entire</text>
  <text start="466.65" dur="4.67">show they&amp;#39;ve been running this for a</text>
  <text start="469.47" dur="5.13">very long time their plan is very simple</text>
  <text start="471.32" dur="5.92">they want to be the the a want to be</text>
  <text start="474.6" dur="5.4">blenders and buyers of last resort this</text>
  <text start="477.24" dur="4.62">whole good cop eh cop charade between</text>
  <text start="480" dur="3.33">the president and the Fed is as well</text>
  <text start="481.86" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s been it&amp;#39;s a good cop bad cop</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="5.39">charade the Federal Reserve wants to</text>
  <text start="485.88" dur="5.16">lower rates the Federal Reserve wants to</text>
  <text start="488.72" dur="4.21">devalue the currency want they get</text>
  <text start="491.04" dur="3.6">stronger they get to own everything</text>
  <text start="492.93" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re witnessing around the</text>
  <text start="494.64" dur="4.02">world people are too blind to see it</text>
  <text start="497.37" dur="4.26">sounds like a science fiction movie</text>
  <text start="498.66" dur="4.44">again take the blinders off look at look</text>
  <text start="501.63" dur="3.66">at what&amp;#39;s in front of you you can see</text>
  <text start="503.1" dur="4.98">what&amp;#39;s happening I definitely know that</text>
  <text start="505.29" dur="5.1">me economy is is heading in a bad way</text>
  <text start="508.08" dur="5.22">and the everything bubble is coming to a</text>
  <text start="510.39" dur="4.23">startling conclusion very soon and what</text>
  <text start="513.3" dur="3.45">would you suggest before I let you go</text>
  <text start="514.62" dur="4.65">that people can do to prepare themselves</text>
  <text start="516.75" dur="3.93">for this well I mean there there are a</text>
  <text start="519.27" dur="4.68">myriad of things that people can do</text>
  <text start="520.68" dur="5.37">number one number one and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="523.95" dur="3.81">sitting in this since day one bet</text>
  <text start="526.05" dur="3.48">against the debt and become your own</text>
  <text start="527.76" dur="4.11">central link that means hold a hard</text>
  <text start="529.53" dur="2.97">asset we understand the situation is</text>
  <text start="531.87" dur="2.43">very simple</text>
  <text start="532.5" dur="4.32">well central banks have to inflate and</text>
  <text start="534.3" dur="4.53">we haven&amp;#39;t seen anything yet we are</text>
  <text start="536.82" dur="5.76">going to get a new round of capital</text>
  <text start="538.83" dur="5.55">injections capital purchases like you</text>
  <text start="542.58" dur="3.48">can&amp;#39;t believe so this is a new part of</text>
  <text start="544.38" dur="4.53">easing you want to bed begin is that</text>
  <text start="546.06" dur="5.07">will central banks are very very I</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="3.6">wouldn&amp;#39;t say you know they&amp;#39;re desperate</text>
  <text start="551.13" dur="3.33">a little bit in that they got to keep</text>
  <text start="552.51" dur="4.05">inflating but again all this is gonna do</text>
  <text start="554.46" dur="3.69">is flush the wealth transfer that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="556.56" dur="2.82">this is all about every world central</text>
  <text start="558.15" dur="3.27">bank isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="3.9">bubble blower and we have risk on</text>
  <text start="561.42" dur="3.75">environments and risk off right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="563.28" dur="5.28">risk on cash keeps moving into that</text>
  <text start="565.17" dur="4.59">stock market as rates be stay suppressed</text>
  <text start="568.56" dur="3.6">and they&amp;#39;re gonna get suppressed even</text>
  <text start="569.76" dur="2.85">worse middle class is gonna force to own</text>
  <text start="572.16" dur="3.66">that</text>
  <text start="572.61" dur="5.19">so hold a hard asset physical gold</text>
  <text start="575.82" dur="4.86">physical silver more specifically</text>
  <text start="577.8" dur="5.16">physical silver now those out here who</text>
  <text start="580.68" dur="5.28">are locked in or believe they are locked</text>
  <text start="582.96" dur="5.52">into a 401k plan or some investment that</text>
  <text start="585.96" dur="4.89">only makes money when stocks go up well</text>
