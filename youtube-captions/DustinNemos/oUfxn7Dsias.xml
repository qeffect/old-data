  <text start="35.489" dur="2.851">recent ones because the first ones I</text>
  <text start="37.02" dur="3.51">never even recorded them all people</text>

  <text start="55.5" dur="4.44">more aggressive but I am treating issues</text>
  <text start="57.719" dur="4.14">not just maintaining healthiness I am</text>
  <text start="59.94" dur="4.619">noticing improved mental clarity more</text>
  <text start="61.859" dur="5.041">vivid dreams and less abdomen bloat I</text>
  <text start="64.559" dur="4.861">also have decreased joint inflammation</text>
  <text start="66.9" dur="5.55">not debilitating but was quite annoying</text>
  <text start="69.42" dur="5.94">I anticipated possibly excruciating with</text>
  <text start="72.45" dur="4.709">her flow but not feeling any better I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="75.36" dur="3.66">not sure what that one is even my foot</text>
  <text start="77.159" dur="3.661">feels better to reconstructive surgeries</text>
  <text start="79.02" dur="4.5">after trauma which is amazing as I had</text>
  <text start="80.82" dur="4.65">given up on giving up everything I loved</text>
  <text start="83.52" dur="4.98">due to it and now have hoped to return</text>
  <text start="85.47" dur="5.579">to long hikes and living as I really</text>
  <text start="88.5" dur="5.159">don&amp;#39;t care which is doing wit what I</text>

  <text start="101.34" dur="6.93">printer cartridge issue hacked - what a</text>
  <text start="103.829" dur="5.911">scam printer ink is yep here&amp;#39;s one I</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="3.45">actually did a video about this recently</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="4.05">but alright here a few health</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="5.009">observations I&amp;#39;m a national level tennis</text>
  <text start="113.79" dur="5.369">player and my age in the last 15 years I</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="4.261">was only able to play with contacts for</text>
  <text start="119.159" dur="4.14">movies I had to wear glasses none of</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="4.169">this is needed anymore in addition my</text>
  <text start="123.299" dur="4.14">recovery time after tennis matches or</text>
  <text start="125.159" dur="4.35">rough yoga sessions for that matter has</text>
  <text start="127.439" dur="4.531">improved so significantly it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="129.509" dur="4.141">not describable just four weeks ago I</text>
  <text start="131.97" dur="3.719">got diagnosed with Lyme disease</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="4.289">which was found two point five months</text>
  <text start="135.689" dur="3.991">after the line closing event that is</text>
  <text start="137.939" dur="3.991">typically too late to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="139.68" dur="2.88">disease I had to take antibiotics for</text>
  <text start="141.93" dur="2.79">three weeks</text>
  <text start="142.56" dur="4.86">I usually never take any antibiotics or</text>
  <text start="144.72" dur="4.89">Western medicine drugs however in this</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="4.289">case it was the right thing to do doctor</text>
  <text start="149.61" dur="4.799">told me that I would feel our told me I</text>
  <text start="151.709" dur="4.11">would feel really sick and likely throw</text>
  <text start="154.409" dur="4.53">up and deal with stomachache be</text>
  <text start="155.819" dur="5.28">extremely fatigued etc guess what I</text>
  <text start="158.939" dur="4.321">continued to play three hour-long tennis</text>
  <text start="161.099" dur="4.051">matches in 95 degrees I felt great the</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="4.02">whole time despite the heavy antibiotics</text>
  <text start="165.15" dur="5.489">and now I got rid of the Lyme disease</text>
  <text start="167.28" dur="6.09">the very obvious observation is that the</text>
  <text start="170.639" dur="4.201">antibiotics did their job while the c60</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="3.78">was preventing any noticeable side</text>
  <text start="174.84" dur="5.19">effects yes I live a healthy life so</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="4.52">that helps too but and I had the full</text>
  <text start="180.03" dur="3.659">reserves to push through this time</text>
  <text start="181.67" dur="4.599">nicely and be done with this pretty</text>
  <text start="183.689" dur="4.741">horrific disease in no time c60 is</text>
  <text start="186.269" dur="4.771">absolutely amazing I plan to do a video</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="4.709">on that at some point we also have a</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="4.949">friend who almost died after many years</text>
  <text start="193.139" dur="5.46">of heavy MS and from that resulting</text>
  <text start="195.989" dur="5.101">other issues guess where she ended out</text>
  <text start="198.599" dur="4.2">three months after taking c60 before</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="4.44">almost dead in a wheelchair not even</text>
  <text start="202.799" dur="5.491">able to hold a coffee cup she is all up</text>
  <text start="205.53" dur="5.16">again and even treats patients again as</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="4.74">a physical and massage therapist miracle</text>
  <text start="210.69" dur="3.96">yeah indeed I will add I went to school</text>
  <text start="213.03" dur="3.03">for massage therapy that is rough work</text>
  <text start="214.65" dur="4.53">on the body it&amp;#39;s actually very difficult</text>
  <text start="216.06" dur="5.639">like I can&amp;#39;t do it because I got ran</text>
  <text start="219.18" dur="4.019">over a week from the course being</text>
  <text start="221.699" dur="3.361">finished I couldn&amp;#39;t take the final test</text>
  <text start="223.199" dur="5.491">but it&amp;#39;s pretty hard on the back to do a</text>
  <text start="225.06" dur="6.299">real like good massage I do know that</text>
  <text start="228.69" dur="4.65">c60 also works on energetic levels which</text>
  <text start="231.359" dur="3.421">most of you may not relate to but it</text>
  <text start="233.34" dur="3.239">does most certainly increase the ability</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="4.23">to sense to see and to connect with</text>
  <text start="236.579" dur="3.87">spirit I can&amp;#39;t prove that but I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="239.01" dur="3.649">on a spiritual journey for two decades</text>
  <text start="240.449" dur="5.1">it accelerates development in that sense</text>
  <text start="242.659" dur="4.51">here&amp;#39;s another and this is one of the</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="3.81">people for those who&amp;#39;ve been around a</text>
  <text start="247.169" dur="4.591">while I sent out a couple of like small</text>
  <text start="249.359" dur="4.05">bottles for pets kind of at cost just to</text>
  <text start="251.76" dur="3.629">help out some people had some really</text>
  <text start="253.409" dur="4.401">sick animals and I wanted to get some</text>
  <text start="255.389" dur="5.52">some video reviews and stuff back in</text>
  <text start="257.81" dur="4.599">none of them gave me video reviews but</text>
  <text start="260.909" dur="3.151">they didn&amp;#39;t some of them write me some</text>
  <text start="262.409" dur="4.471">comments back and I&amp;#39;m not going to hold</text>
  <text start="264.06" dur="6.87">it against them in this case</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="6.15">this is six days an on on a 27:18 Riley</text>
  <text start="270.93" dur="5.22">is 15 years old been blind this is a dog</text>
  <text start="273.03" dur="5.4">been blind since October 2016 even</text>
  <text start="276.15" dur="2.76">though he&amp;#39;s had two eye surgeries poor</text>
  <text start="278.43" dur="2.61">dog</text>
  <text start="278.91" dur="4.38">I knew his eyesight would gradually go</text>
  <text start="281.04" dur="5.22">some complications were remedied with</text>
  <text start="283.29" dur="4.29">surgery but not all I started c60 on 821</text>
  <text start="286.26" dur="3.36">and I can tell he is feeling better</text>
  <text start="287.58" dur="3.96">already his walk is longer he&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="289.62" dur="3.99">active in a better mood and sleeping</text>
  <text start="291.54" dur="4.26">well this morning he walked around a</text>
  <text start="293.61" dur="5.07">garbage bin shocked me because normally</text>
  <text start="295.8" dur="5.28">he walks right around oh he will walk</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="4.47">right into a parked car he was able to</text>
  <text start="301.08" dur="5.43">stay on the sidewalk - he falls off</text>
  <text start="303.15" dur="5.34">constantly maybe carbon 60 word she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.51" dur="4.5">saying he falls off constantly typically</text>
  <text start="308.49" dur="5.55">maybe carbon 60 reduced inflammation in</text>
  <text start="311.01" dur="5.85">his joints and around his eyes she</text>
  <text start="314.04" dur="6.75">actually did send me a video this one</text>
  <text start="316.86" dur="6">did Minnie didn&amp;#39;t and I have it in the</text>
  <text start="320.79" dur="3.27">folder Asst Karen&amp;#39;s Riley so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="322.86" dur="2.94">even aligned with that on there I</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="5.04">shouldn&amp;#39;t have even included that part</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="5.07">but there&amp;#39;s the video link as well hi</text>
  <text start="329.1" dur="3.18">Dustin I did not make a video of right</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="3.09">list of the follow up I did not make a</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="3.12">video of Riley the changes I am seeing</text>
  <text start="333.96" dur="2.82">are only apparent through knowing him</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="3.42">good things are happening with his</text>
  <text start="336.78" dur="4.89">health Riley&amp;#39;s walk has extended from</text>
  <text start="338.82" dur="5.49">one and a half blocks to nine blocks and</text>
  <text start="341.67" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s fast pace walking</text>
  <text start="344.31" dur="4.68">he&amp;#39;s more laid-back relaxed and in a</text>
  <text start="346.35" dur="4.77">better mood - before I had to catch the</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="4.29">right day and moment to groom him or he</text>
  <text start="351.12" dur="4.89">would growl and snap at me his body must</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="4.47">be easing up from aches and pains I will</text>
  <text start="356.01" dur="3.3">get back to you to let you know of any</text>
  <text start="357.75" dur="4.74">significant improvements with Riley</text>
  <text start="359.31" dur="4.74">please be well best Karen and Riley it</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="4.17">warms my heart to see animals that are</text>
  <text start="364.05" dur="4.56">suffering like that get better and of</text>
  <text start="366.66" dur="3.45">course I&amp;#39;m not gonna say that I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="3.51">making any kinds of claims I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="3.48">giving any kind of medical advice you</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="3.3">know do your own research this is</text>
  <text start="373.59" dur="3.54">experimental you know even though the</text>
  <text start="375.42" dur="4.35">head researcher in the rat study which</text>
  <text start="377.13" dur="5.01">was a toxicity study said safe at high</text>
  <text start="379.77" dur="3.51">levels over long periods of time you</text>
  <text start="382.14" dur="3.66">know I still have to put out those</text>
  <text start="383.28" dur="3.99">disclaimers I&amp;#39;m not gonna even say that</text>
  <text start="385.8" dur="3.45">these are going to be typical results</text>
  <text start="387.27" dur="3.93">for people I can&amp;#39;t even do that but</text>
  <text start="389.25" dur="7.32">these are what people have said to me</text>
  <text start="391.2" dur="7.32">honestly let&amp;#39;s see this one is from a</text>
  <text start="396.57" dur="2.55">person I&amp;#39;ve been taking c60 for about</text>
  <text start="398.52" dur="2.07">three months</text>
  <text start="399.12" dur="3.6">initially started with c6</text>
  <text start="400.59" dur="4.41">in olive oil but switched to c16 coconut</text>
  <text start="402.72" dur="4.29">oil for the last two months taken orally</text>
  <text start="405" dur="4.98">usually directly about one to two</text>
  <text start="407.01" dur="4.56">tablespoons per day that&amp;#39;s a lot which I</text>
  <text start="409.98" dur="4.59">found more effective and better tasting</text>
  <text start="411.57" dur="5.73">prior to taking c60 I have to say I&amp;#39;m in</text>
  <text start="414.57" dur="5.64">pretty good health and pretty athletic</text>
  <text start="417.3" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;m quite an avid runner having run</text>
  <text start="420.21" dur="4.14">marathons last year although now I have</text>
  <text start="422.61" dur="3.83">relatively minor chronic injury and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="424.35" dur="4.41">switching over to biking for a while</text>
  <text start="426.44" dur="5.35">after take about three to four weeks on</text>
  <text start="428.76" dur="4.98">c60 I did notice improved stamina and</text>
  <text start="431.79" dur="4.2">energy with better more restful sleeping</text>
  <text start="433.74" dur="4.41">since I had to back off my running</text>
  <text start="435.99" dur="4.02">schedule it&amp;#39;s hard to correlate c60 to</text>
  <text start="438.15" dur="3.99">better recovery times or improve stamina</text>
  <text start="440.01" dur="5.07">too much but I would say that overall</text>
  <text start="442.14" dur="5.46">energy levels were higher simultaneous</text>
  <text start="445.08" dur="5.4">with the c60 I also started a program of</text>
  <text start="447.6" dur="4.74">intermittent fasting for about six weeks</text>
  <text start="450.48" dur="5.37">combined the results were really</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="4.8">phenomenal there are plenty of videos</text>
  <text start="455.85" dur="3.21">out there but intermittent fasting</text>
  <text start="457.14" dur="3.99">generally requires you to restrict any</text>
  <text start="459.06" dur="4.92">caloric intake even supplements and</text>
  <text start="461.13" dur="5.22">coffee only water to a window in a 24</text>
  <text start="463.98" dur="4.59">hour day if somewhere between 4 to 9</text>
  <text start="466.35" dur="4.83">hours for is really aggressive really</text>
  <text start="468.57" dur="4.73">for high-performance athletes but from 6</text>
  <text start="471.18" dur="4.86">to 9 hours is relatively comfortable</text>
  <text start="473.3" dur="4.24">whatever you can work up to this reduces</text>
  <text start="476.04" dur="3.3">the amount of time you have insulin in</text>
  <text start="477.54" dur="4.14">your system forcing your body to burn</text>
  <text start="479.34" dur="4.68">more body fat during the day you can</text>
  <text start="481.68" dur="4.26">still eat a full day&amp;#39;s calories in the</text>
  <text start="484.02" dur="3.3">four to nine hour window and you should</text>
  <text start="485.94" dur="3.27">drink a lot of water throughout the</text>
  <text start="487.32" dur="3.96">whole day without limiting calories I</text>
  <text start="489.21" dur="4.17">burned a lot of weight and had a lot</text>
  <text start="491.28" dur="3.51">more energy and coupled with the c60</text>
  <text start="493.38" dur="3.96">increased overall strength and energy</text>
  <text start="494.79" dur="4.35">even though I had to I had backed off</text>
  <text start="497.34" dur="3.72">the real rigorous training due to the</text>
  <text start="499.14" dur="3.72">running injury I did spend more time</text>
  <text start="501.06" dur="3.69">lifting weights and now biking and</text>
  <text start="502.86" dur="2.78">probably feel leaner and stronger than</text>
  <text start="504.75" dur="4.47">when I was running long distances</text>
  <text start="505.64" dur="5.59">regularly I will add to the the</text>
  <text start="509.22" dur="3.78">intermittent fasting thing that that is</text>
  <text start="511.23" dur="3.75">a really great thing to do it&amp;#39;s easier</text>
  <text start="513" dur="4.17">than typical fasting and I in my</text>
  <text start="514.98" dur="4.65">experience at least and you should not</text>
  <text start="517.17" dur="4.41">do that probably if you are pregnant or</text>
  <text start="519.63" dur="3.78">nursing of course because that your body</text>
  <text start="521.58" dur="4.85">has different needs and that fasting is</text>
  <text start="523.41" dur="5.28">not necessarily the best thing for that</text>
  <text start="526.43" dur="4.27">he continues the only other real</text>
  <text start="528.69" dur="5.19">supplement and food intake I&amp;#39;m a huge</text>
  <text start="530.7" dur="3.81">fan of its branch chain amino acids BCAA</text>
  <text start="533.88" dur="2.73">which are</text>
  <text start="534.51" dur="3.45">a highly enriched protein powder that</text>
  <text start="536.61" dur="3.93">really aids in muscle building and</text>
  <text start="537.96" dur="4.88">athletic recovery after a workout taking</text>
  <text start="540.54" dur="4.62">BCA can really help build a leaner</text>
