  <text start="101.64" dur="4.38">they think Bitcoin or something but you</text>

  <text start="108.63" dur="3.84">read nearly the way they used to be now</text>
  <text start="110.37" dur="4.41">information has transferred to the</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="4.62">Internet so the modern form of</text>
  <text start="114.78" dur="4.59">book-burning censorship has really</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="3.84">become bit burning and that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="119.37" dur="4.11">the point we wanted to drive home with</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="4.26">this campaign and of course you know we</text>

  <text start="196.05" dur="5.939">online to try to find it if the thank</text>
  <text start="198.33" dur="7.08">you um yeah you know circling back to</text>
  <text start="201.989" dur="5.641">what you said a moment ago about act the</text>
  <text start="205.41" dur="6.6">movie being censored from the Tribeca</text>
  <text start="207.63" dur="7.859">Film Festival in 20 it was 2016 if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="212.01" dur="6.33">not mistaken and you know it was all</text>
  <text start="215.489" dur="7.261">over the headlines in mainstream media</text>
  <text start="218.34" dur="8.16">that Robert De Niro had to pull back the</text>
  <text start="222.75" dur="5.7">movie from the Tribeca Film Festival due</text>
  <text start="226.5" dur="4.5">to pressure from some of the sponsors of</text>
  <text start="228.45" dur="5.52">the Tribeca Film Festival and what was</text>
  <text start="231" dur="4.37">brilliant is that had this sort of I</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="5.519">think it&amp;#39;s called the Streisand effect</text>
  <text start="235.37" dur="6.16">where suddenly the film became that much</text>
  <text start="239.489" dur="6.991">more interesting because it got kicked</text>
  <text start="241.53" dur="8.79">out you know Lori Gregory&amp;#39;s down now</text>
  <text start="246.48" dur="7.31">she&amp;#39;s down in Florida she managed to</text>
  <text start="250.32" dur="6.69">bring that to his first major film</text>
  <text start="253.79" dur="6.939">festival on her Springs Film Festival in</text>
  <text start="257.01" dur="6.33">Ocala Florida and that really you know</text>
  <text start="260.729" dur="5.281">kicked off the movement I like to say</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="4.829">because soon after that of course Polly</text>
  <text start="266.01" dur="4.32">Tommy was doing her interviews of</text>
  <text start="268.169" dur="4.681">vaccine injured families and of course</text>
  <text start="270.33" dur="4.709">now she&amp;#39;s working on including</text>
  <text start="272.85" dur="7.319">unvaccinated you know never vaccinated</text>
  <text start="275.039" dur="7.5">families and sorry but usually that the</text>
  <text start="280.169" dur="3.87">oldest child was actually injured and so</text>
  <text start="282.539" dur="4.771">the younger children are not vaccinated</text>
  <text start="284.039" dur="6.861">and therefore families are now sharing</text>
  <text start="287.31" dur="6.15">their own in-home scientific studies</text>
  <text start="290.9" dur="3.61">based on observation of what happened</text>
  <text start="293.46" dur="3.99">within their own</text>
  <text start="294.51" dur="4.05">and the testimonies of these families is</text>
  <text start="297.45" dur="5.85">staggering</text>
  <text start="298.56" dur="7.95">but I predict much like Tribeca you know</text>
  <text start="303.3" dur="5.54">the film being kicked out of Tribeca</text>
  <text start="306.51" dur="5.64">that that would probably happen again</text>
  <text start="308.84" dur="6.19">because we&amp;#39;re seeing you know shadow</text>
  <text start="312.15" dur="6.3">banning we&amp;#39;re seeing low distribution</text>
  <text start="315.03" dur="5.37">numbers we&amp;#39;re seeing you know sometimes</text>
  <text start="318.45" dur="4.43">something as simple as trying to like a</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="5.1">video or share a video is becoming</text>
  <text start="322.88" dur="6.16">increasingly more difficult to get the</text>
  <text start="325.5" dur="6.18">word out so the powers that be including</text>
  <text start="329.04" dur="5.58">Google including YouTube you know</text>
  <text start="331.68" dur="5.34">including mainstream media they really</text>
  <text start="334.62" dur="4.95">only have one narrative and it is not</text>
  <text start="337.02" dur="5.7">the truth so I think it&amp;#39;s perfect that</text>
  <text start="339.57" dur="6.51">you&amp;#39;re having some of my session on with</text>
  <text start="342.72" dur="4.8">us today because he is a leader in what</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="3.72">I love to call the truth movement</text>
  <text start="347.52" dur="4.26">because you know you guys are out there</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="5.01">sharing about not only the censorship</text>
  <text start="351.78" dur="6.48">that you&amp;#39;re experiencing but also ways</text>
  <text start="354.81" dur="5.52">in which means your media are spreading</text>
  <text start="358.26" dur="6.15">lies and disinformation twisting the</text>
  <text start="360.33" dur="6">truth taping things in the dark and you</text>
  <text start="364.41" dur="4.53">know I could go on and on so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="366.33" dur="5.31">mean to take it yeah shell line after</text>
  <text start="368.94" dur="4.92">hashtag CDC whistleblower you know a lot</text>

  <text start="377.36" dur="6.7">Washington University to come after us</text>
  <text start="380.25" dur="6.63">and to hijack our hashtag and they felt</text>
  <text start="384.06" dur="4.86">it was still early in that tech game</text>
  <text start="386.88" dur="5.67">where they were trying to send box after</text>

  <text start="445.08" dur="4.739">in autism one it was difficult for me</text>
  <text start="447.09" dur="4.829">because there were so many parents there</text>

  <text start="451.919" dur="5.401">experiences to hear him out and you know</text>
  <text start="454.44" dur="4.8">in my experience as probably the most</text>
  <text start="457.32" dur="4.469">censored person who&amp;#39;s still on YouTube I</text>

  <text start="465.78" dur="5.43">thousand the vaccine issue itself has</text>
  <text start="469.32" dur="6.81">been the most censored thing I&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="471.21" dur="6.69">seen period and I was invited to autism</text>

  <text start="480.27" dur="7.139">voice yeah and and just that the</text>
  <text start="484.199" dur="4.801">censorship to this issue compared to</text>
  <text start="487.409" dur="3.721">other issues I mean the only thing I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="489" dur="3.99">seen even remotely like that lately is</text>
  <text start="491.13" dur="3.12">if you try to talk about the</text>

  <text start="745.65" dur="5.52">to do in order to break censorship and I</text>
  <text start="748.68" dur="4.17">told him about my story briefly I just</text>
  <text start="751.17" dur="4.74">started my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="752.85" dur="7.77">Christmas Eve 2017 I think it was around</text>
  <text start="755.91" dur="7.77">February I I got banned that year and</text>
  <text start="760.62" dur="4.23">then I had a baby do one month later had</text>
  <text start="763.68" dur="3.24">just lost my business on YouTube</text>
  <text start="764.85" dur="3.89">everything taken from me because I poked</text>
  <text start="766.92" dur="4.05">about about the truth on YouTube and</text>
  <text start="768.74" dur="4.72">they called it hate speech or some</text>
  <text start="770.97" dur="5.31">nonsense no real answer I told him about</text>
  <text start="773.46" dur="5.76">that and he he gave me a price tag to do</text>
  <text start="776.28" dur="5.34">some research a basic research package</text>
  <text start="779.22" dur="4.62">that will give us hopefully what we to</text>
  <text start="781.62" dur="4.53">get past a dismissal that&amp;#39;s what usually</text>
  <text start="783.84" dur="4.26">happens no they just get a dismissal and</text>
  <text start="786.15" dur="3.99">then no one gets anywhere we want</text>
  <text start="788.1" dur="3.81">discovery we want to get into their</text>
  <text start="790.14" dur="4.23">files and their records we want to prove</text>
  <text start="791.91" dur="4.41">what they&amp;#39;re doing to us so we did a</text>
  <text start="794.37" dur="4.17">search package and of the four options</text>
  <text start="796.32" dur="5.64">that he found that might be a viable way</text>
  <text start="798.54" dur="7.14">forward the best thing he said are oddly</text>
  <text start="801.96" dur="5.7">with is a class-action antitrust so a</text>
  <text start="805.68" dur="4.17">class is any group of people as I</text>
  <text start="807.66" dur="4.32">understand it that are very similar like</text>
  <text start="809.85" dur="4.23">a bunch of youtubers and independent</text>
  <text start="811.98" dur="4.08">media folks who just had our our entire</text>
  <text start="814.08" dur="4.8">businesses ripped away from us and sent</text>
  <text start="816.06" dur="5.04">to Fox News and and CNN and all of the</text>
  <text start="818.88" dur="5.09">big corporate media types the the fake</text>
  <text start="821.1" dur="5.16">news types rather than being sent to</text>
  <text start="823.97" dur="4.24">where they were going which is us where</text>
  <text start="826.26" dur="4.13">we had earned massive audiences and huge</text>
  <text start="828.21" dur="5.01">followings and now we&amp;#39;re down about 90%</text>
  <text start="830.39" dur="4.54">so there&amp;#39;s a lot of energy behind that</text>
  <text start="833.22" dur="3.6">there&amp;#39;s a lot of angry influencers out</text>
  <text start="834.93" dur="4.47">there who have been through things like</text>
  <text start="836.82" dur="4.02">that who have lost a lot they sacrificed</text>
  <text start="839.4" dur="3.3">a lot to get to this point</text>
  <text start="840.84" dur="4.74">and now they&amp;#39;re being snuffed out and</text>
  <text start="842.7" dur="6.78">they erased and bit burned from the</text>
  <text start="845.58" dur="5.55">internet so that&amp;#39;s a class you know</text>
  <text start="849.48" dur="3.45">there may even be multiple classes in</text>
  <text start="851.13" dur="3.63">there and there may be even multiple</text>
  <text start="852.93" dur="4.23">classes against multiple big tech</text>
  <text start="854.76" dur="6.57">companies I imagine that there will</text>
  <text start="857.16" dur="6.3">eventually be however right now we need</text>
  <text start="861.33" dur="5.4">the moment and we need the moment</text>
  <text start="863.46" dur="5.91">we need 50 to 100 influencers on the</text>
  <text start="866.73" dur="4.53">same page talking the same message about</text>
  <text start="869.37" dur="4.23">censorship so that we can drive enough</text>
  <text start="871.26" dur="3.96">people I can take them on in the courts</text>
  <text start="873.6" dur="3.09">because there&amp;#39;s no one there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="875.22" dur="3.75">independent media figure that can take</text>
  <text start="876.69" dur="4.44">on at Google or Twitter or Facebook or</text>
  <text start="878.97" dur="4.38">YouTube alone but together we could do</text>
  <text start="881.13" dur="3.87">that and that&amp;#39;s kind of you know what</text>
  <text start="883.35" dur="4.2">what we&amp;#39;re doing here and what we hope</text>
  <text start="885" dur="6.29">to achieve and class action just seems</text>
  <text start="887.55" dur="6.42">to be the best attack that we have</text>
  <text start="891.29" dur="5.47">testing can you stick to YouTube&amp;#39;s new</text>
  <text start="893.97" dur="5.82">rules on going into effect on December</text>

  <text start="912.75" dur="4.32">basically just attacked independent</text>
  <text start="914.85" dur="4.14">media and tried to call it dangerous and</text>
  <text start="917.07" dur="3.81">hateful and racist and then who knows</text>

  <text start="934.589" dur="4.981">expect blatant bans the same day they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="941.37" dur="3.12">youtuber</text>
  <text start="941.97" dur="4.05">and and that&amp;#39;s a problem because me</text>

  <text start="968.579" dur="3.991">same day it&amp;#39;s too obvious but I do think</text>
  <text start="971.04" dur="3.03">that the fake news is trying to get</text>
  <text start="972.57" dur="3.36">ahead of it and they&amp;#39;re preparing for</text>

  <text start="1052.94" dur="5.02">nice pick will speak to that a little</text>
  <text start="1055.05" dur="6.75">bit I was starting to write like I was a</text>
  <text start="1057.96" dur="6.36">youtuber Christmas Eve 2017 and then</text>
  <text start="1061.8" dur="6.42">very quickly almost 50,000 subscribers</text>
  <text start="1064.32" dur="5.61">and you know by I around 30,000 I was</text>
  <text start="1068.22" dur="2.88">starting to think hey I might be able to</text>
  <text start="1069.93" dur="3.33">make the career out of telling the truth</text>
  <text start="1071.1" dur="5.76">and fighting fake news I was getting</text>
  <text start="1073.26" dur="6.3">really really pumped up about this by</text>
  <text start="1076.86" dur="5.46">the time I got banned I had just enough</text>
  <text start="1079.56" dur="5.82">donations to to get through that and</text>
  <text start="1082.32" dur="5.94">rebuild another channel before basically</text>
  <text start="1085.38" dur="4.32">you know we had to go back to it to the</text>
  <text start="1088.26" dur="3.84">normal day job and quit doing what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1089.7" dur="4.89">doing with this media business but</text>
  <text start="1092.1" dur="4.62">fortunately you know we overcame all of</text>
  <text start="1094.59" dur="4.71">that and we were really got a lot of</text>
  <text start="1096.72" dur="5.82">monetization from YouTube because they</text>
  <text start="1099.3" dur="6.03">would rather than like if your</text>
  <text start="1102.54" dur="4.41">monetization is technically on sure we</text>
  <text start="1105.33" dur="3.78">had that for a long time so that we</text>
  <text start="1106.95" dur="4.02">could get better view of placements and</text>
  <text start="1109.11" dur="4.2">rankings and such because that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="1110.97" dur="3.84">how it used to work but what they would</text>
  <text start="1113.31" dur="3.3">do is take and I&amp;#39;m sure this is happen</text>
  <text start="1114.81" dur="4.23">to you got it would take your video lag</text>
  <text start="1116.61" dur="4.26">it D monetize it and then you have to</text>
  <text start="1119.04" dur="4.2">appeal that video before you get it</text>
  <text start="1120.87" dur="3.9">turned back on and by then all of</text>
  <text start="1123.24" dur="2.91">watches all the views have been done</text>
  <text start="1124.77" dur="4.17">you&amp;#39;re not going to get paid for any ads</text>
  <text start="1126.15" dur="4.26">so really you know I would get pennies</text>
  <text start="1128.94" dur="2.64">where I should have been making tens of</text>
  <text start="1130.41" dur="2.999">thousands of dollars</text>
  <text start="1131.58" dur="5.01">you know is a big YouTube channel or</text>
  <text start="1133.409" dur="6.33">something right and never happens but a</text>
  <text start="1136.59" dur="4.529">lot of a lot of people like myself were</text>
  <text start="1139.739" dur="3">in a position where they could have made</text>
  <text start="1141.119" dur="3.81">a career out of tell truth and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1142.739" dur="4.14">gone under because of things like this</text>
  <text start="1144.929" dur="4.261">they&amp;#39;ve had to close up their channels</text>
  <text start="1146.879" dur="3.93">and these are voices that were effective</text>
  <text start="1149.19" dur="4.5">at speaking out against the fake news</text>
  <text start="1150.809" dur="4.74">right so we&amp;#39;re having attrition we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1412.85" dur="10.02">we need to have our voices heard we need</text>
  <text start="1415.82" dur="10.68">to save the kids and we need to</text>
  <text start="1422.87" dur="8.01">a broader audience then stop - singing</text>
  <text start="1426.5" dur="6.39">bar own choir jump if I may speak to</text>
  <text start="1430.88" dur="4.02">that what you said kind of triggered a</text>
  <text start="1432.89" dur="4.77">thought and this is something I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="1434.9" dur="4.56">in the past but for the for the</text>
  <text start="1437.66" dur="4.23">listening audience out there whose core</text>
  <text start="1439.46" dur="4.65">issue with vaccines and I&amp;#39;m with you</text>
  <text start="1441.89" dur="3.87">because damaging the children damages</text>
  <text start="1444.11" dur="3.33">everything else that happens right it</text>
  <text start="1445.76" dur="3.87">says the whole world up for failure on</text>
  <text start="1447.44" dur="4.56">every other issue and I totally get it I</text>
  <text start="1449.63" dur="5.549">want to take serious how connected it is</text>
  <text start="1452" dur="5.55">and I want people to consider that most</text>
  <text start="1455.179" dur="4.321">people who have not had the damage or</text>
  <text start="1457.55" dur="3.96">they haven&amp;#39;t seen the victimization in</text>
  <text start="1459.5" dur="3.84">their own family or seen it firsthand a</text>
  <text start="1461.51" dur="3.18">lot of them don&amp;#39;t want to believe it</text>
  <text start="1463.34" dur="4.589">until it&amp;#39;s too late</text>
  <text start="1464.69" dur="5.25">but while they haven&amp;#39;t felt the damage</text>
  <text start="1467.929" dur="4.231">of the vaccines themselves maybe they</text>
  <text start="1469.94" dur="4.17">have it and been impacted by that yet</text>
  <text start="1472.16" dur="4.41">many of them will care about freedom of</text>
  <text start="1474.11" dur="5.22">speech so it&amp;#39;s an issue that you could</text>
  <text start="1476.57" dur="5.46">get a really broad base of support on</text>
  <text start="1479.33" dur="5.01">from every other issue and I would also</text>
  <text start="1482.03" dur="4.68">add to that if we lose on the free</text>
  <text start="1484.34" dur="4.589">speech issue every other issue is lost</text>
  <text start="1486.71" dur="4.29">doesn&amp;#39;t matter what it is or hurt so</text>
  <text start="1488.929" dur="3.901">this is really where we have to make our</text>
  <text start="1491" dur="3.9">stand and this is an opportunity for</text>
  <text start="1492.83" dur="4.14">everyone to be involved and and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1494.9" dur="3.75">consider myself a leader at all and this</text>
  <text start="1496.97" dur="3.839">is just sort of a roundtable</text>
  <text start="1498.65" dur="4.38">conversation between a lot of different</text>

  <text start="1622.14" dur="3.87">I wanted to do first is to get the word</text>

  <text start="1626.01" dur="4.529">that maybe sharing that load wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1627.899" dur="4.861">as bad millions of Patriots millions of</text>
  <text start="1630.539" dur="4.471">free features involved then I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1632.76" dur="4.889">appropriate to create like a non-profit</text>
  <text start="1635.01" dur="4.83">or legal advocate advocacy group and</text>
  <text start="1637.649" dur="4.26">then maybe set up a board or something</text>
  <text start="1639.84" dur="3.93">of censer journalists to help you run it</text>
  <text start="1641.909" dur="3.75">and then we&amp;#39;ll fundraise but right now I</text>
  <text start="1643.77" dur="3.899">just want help to get the word out and</text>
  <text start="1645.659" dur="4.051">especially for big YouTube channels that</text>

  <text start="1653.429" dur="2.911">they don&amp;#39;t have any hope yeah and I want</text>
  <text start="1654.929" dur="3.75">to be able to give them some help I want</text>

  <text start="1933.12" dur="3.21">who have been around on YouTube for a</text>
  <text start="1934.559" dur="4.531">while independent media we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
