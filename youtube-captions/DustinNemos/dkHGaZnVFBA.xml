  <text start="24.3" dur="2.94">other day and I was actually really</text>
  <text start="25.23" dur="5.039">coming after like quote you on that on</text>
  <text start="27.24" dur="5.88">my website or something you can but uh</text>
  <text start="30.269" dur="4.501">okay so things are bad obviously in the</text>
  <text start="33.12" dur="2.939">economy right now and I want to talk</text>
  <text start="34.77" dur="3.15">about a couple of like little funny</text>
  <text start="36.059" dur="4.141">oddities like I wanted to get your</text>
  <text start="37.92" dur="4.139">opinion on like the 2019 Economist</text>
  <text start="40.2" dur="3.39">magazine and kind of you know people are</text>
  <text start="42.059" dur="3.301">joking about how that means things are</text>
  <text start="43.59" dur="2.64">gonna really get bad and there&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="45.36" dur="3.15">foretelling</text>
  <text start="46.23" dur="3.54">from years ago and and they&amp;#39;re in on and</text>
  <text start="48.51" dur="2.67">everything I don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s truth</text>
  <text start="49.77" dur="3.6">to that but it&amp;#39;s certainly kind of a</text>
  <text start="51.18" dur="4.44">funny thing to mention and I also wanted</text>
  <text start="53.37" dur="3.689">to before we get into the topics Zero</text>
  <text start="55.62" dur="4.619">Hedge has been really putting out a lot</text>
  <text start="57.059" dur="4.831">of kind of lefty like anti Trump sort of</text>
  <text start="60.239" dur="3.09">messages lately I don&amp;#39;t know if he</text>
  <text start="61.89" dur="4.979">follows Zero Hedge that was one of my</text>
  <text start="63.329" dur="5.911">favorite sources until recently well you</text>
  <text start="66.869" dur="4.561">know I follow I follow everybody based</text>
  <text start="69.24" dur="4.02">upon the topics that I&amp;#39;m looking to</text>
  <text start="71.43" dur="4.59">research because I just think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="73.26" dur="5.789">good idea in general to read a lot of</text>
  <text start="76.02" dur="6.63">opinions and then begin to and look at</text>
  <text start="79.049" dur="5.64">the facts and see what makes sense so I</text>
  <text start="82.65" dur="3.93">can&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m religious about it but</text>
  <text start="84.689" dur="4.14">yeah I just pulled some information from</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="5.34">them for tomorrow&amp;#39;s video so I</text>
  <text start="88.829" dur="7.411">definitely do pay attention to them but</text>
  <text start="91.92" dur="7.26">I never really get too deeply into</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="6.269">politics because I really do think that</text>
  <text start="99.18" dur="5.549">it&amp;#39;s just really a distraction and I</text>
  <text start="102.509" dur="5.07">feel like their main job is to legalize</text>
  <text start="104.729" dur="4.651">the theft of the bankers who are really</text>
  <text start="107.579" dur="3.811">the ones and the corporations that are</text>
  <text start="109.38" dur="3.66">really the ones that are in control yeah</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="3.6">I can relate like I kind of cover</text>
  <text start="113.04" dur="3.39">politics like I feel like I have to but</text>
  <text start="114.99" dur="3.449">I&amp;#39;m really more interested in sort of</text>
  <text start="116.43" dur="3.719">the economics and the cultural stuff I</text>
  <text start="118.439" dur="2.851">feel like that has impact anyway I mean</text>
  <text start="120.149" dur="5.07">just everybody everything else is just</text>
  <text start="121.29" dur="5.34">words and corruption but so let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="125.219" dur="2.971">about the market like things have gotten</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="4.079">really bad last couple months</text>
  <text start="128.19" dur="4.409">the feds been incrementally or anything</text>
  <text start="130.709" dur="4.26">up Trump is now going after</text>
  <text start="132.599" dur="4.86">the Fed pretty loudly Powell Singh he</text>
  <text start="134.969" dur="6.211">will not resign if asked to ministy is</text>
  <text start="137.459" dur="6.991">escalating yes well I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="6.869">really happening is there was no good</text>
  <text start="144.45" dur="5.97">price discovery in these markets because</text>
  <text start="148.049" dur="5.401">of the policies of the global central</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="8.01">banks so now what the markets are</text>
  <text start="153.45" dur="7.2">attempting to do is properly value the</text>
  <text start="158.43" dur="5.22">stocks and the bond</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="4.86">well not the bonds yet not the buns yeah</text>
  <text start="163.65" dur="7.08">that&amp;#39;s another story come out we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="9.39">going from Central Bank led valuations</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="5.789">to market valuations you know so yeah</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s really what&amp;#39;s happening I mean</text>
  <text start="176.519" dur="5.31">with what has really changed we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="5.089">talked about the global slowdown for a</text>
  <text start="181.829" dur="6.81">really long time so what&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="184.519" dur="5.67">changed is the central bank&amp;#39;s attempting</text>
  <text start="188.639" dur="6.18">to quote-unquote</text>
  <text start="190.189" dur="6.851">normalize their policies by reducing</text>
  <text start="194.819" dur="5.67">their balance sheet therefore taking</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="6.479">money out of the system and raising</text>
  <text start="200.489" dur="4.65">interest rates which is kind of like a</text>
  <text start="203.519" dur="3.99">double whammy in them well that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="205.139" dur="4.081">the markets are reacting to they</text>
  <text start="207.509" dur="5.94">basically cut off the free monopoly</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="8.009">money at a key moment and now things off</text>
  <text start="213.449" dur="5.88">but yeah slowed it down okay well it</text>
  <text start="217.229" dur="2.88">what their next step is gonna be what to</text>
  <text start="219.329" dur="4.65">turn you back on</text>
  <text start="220.109" dur="6">full-speed yeah yeah they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="223.979" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re going to be forced to because</text>
  <text start="226.109" dur="5.761">now what&amp;#39;s really also happening at the</text>
  <text start="228.959" dur="5.73">same time is that the global slowdown</text>
  <text start="231.87" dur="5.22">where all we heard was yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="234.689" dur="5.16">everybody else over there but the u.s.</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="6.69">is just charging forward it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="239.849" dur="6.331">based upon the consumers so the level of</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="5.87">credit card debt and the level of debt</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="7.259">that the consumers have taken on to</text>
  <text start="249.65" dur="7.989">really help things look like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="253.439" dur="6.36">normal well you know I mean consumers</text>
  <text start="257.639" dur="4.951">are not like central banks that can</text>
  <text start="259.799" dur="6.721">print this money at will they have to go</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="5.669">out and they have to earn it so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="4.109">coming to a point where I think you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="268.259" dur="4.681">gonna see the consumer is not going to</text>
  <text start="270.629" dur="5.22">be able to keep taking on more debt to</text>
  <text start="272.94" dur="4.74">buy stuff and the experience actually</text>
  <text start="275.849" dur="4.44">not stuff they don&amp;#39;t even want you to</text>
  <text start="277.68" dur="3.84">buy stuff they want you to buy and</text>
  <text start="280.289" dur="3.481">experience</text>
  <text start="281.52" dur="4.32">smiles instead of specs when you have a</text>
  <text start="283.77" dur="5.63">car commercial things like that yeah</text>
  <text start="285.84" dur="5.579">happy people picnics for drugs yeah</text>
  <text start="289.4" dur="4.66">they&amp;#39;re always trying to sell us on</text>
  <text start="291.419" dur="4.771">emotion good and bad but you know in</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="3.78">ancient Rome when they felt it was</text>
  <text start="296.19" dur="3">largely because they devalued their</text>
  <text start="297.84" dur="2.91">currency I don&amp;#39;t know what percentage</text>
  <text start="299.19" dur="4.11">but I think it&amp;#39;s about where we are and</text>
  <text start="300.75" dur="4.349">the military eventually took over and</text>
  <text start="303.3" dur="3.299">they lasted for a long time very warlike</text>
  <text start="305.099" dur="3.781">people I feel like we&amp;#39;ve already gone</text>
  <text start="306.599" dur="3.6">through a lot of that like we have a</text>
  <text start="308.88" dur="3.629">very powerful military industrial</text>
  <text start="310.199" dur="5.011">complex we&amp;#39;ve been very warlike in</text>
  <text start="312.509" dur="5.16">recent decades and we&amp;#39;ve devalued most</text>
  <text start="315.21" dur="5.25">of our currency so we&amp;#39;re sort of at that</text>
  <text start="317.669" dur="4.05">collapse of Rome scenario and it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="3.179">be big and evening you&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="321.719" dur="5.67">it no wait was just like a precursor and</text>
  <text start="323.639" dur="4.981">this is like Oh 8 times whatever yeah is</text>
  <text start="327.389" dur="4.321">there any sort of timeline that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.62" dur="5.37">shaping up for you yeah well you know</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="5.28">timelines are hard because we&amp;#39;ll the</text>
  <text start="333.99" dur="5.85">wild card just like in 2008</text>
  <text start="336.99" dur="3.63">nobody really foresaw quantitative</text>
  <text start="339.84" dur="3.27">easing</text>
  <text start="340.62" dur="6.18">you know helicopter money you know just</text>
  <text start="343.11" dur="8.459">money for free and at the magnitude and</text>
  <text start="346.8" dur="7.229">you know actually the other part is is</text>
  <text start="351.569" dur="7.701">in what they&amp;#39;re actually trying to</text>
  <text start="354.029" dur="8.971">support so in 2008 you know you had the</text>
  <text start="359.27" dur="6.13">corporations and the elite that really</text>
  <text start="363" dur="5.069">weren&amp;#39;t putting out the loans and doing</text>
  <text start="365.4" dur="5.97">and owning a lot of debt and a lot of</text>
  <text start="368.069" dur="6.69">garbage so and all of those derivatives</text>
  <text start="371.37" dur="7.949">of course which were huge that grew from</text>
  <text start="374.759" dur="6.571">2000 to 2008 so those were inside of the</text>
  <text start="379.319" dur="4.741">banking system and inside of the</text>
  <text start="381.33" dur="5.459">corporations so the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="384.06" dur="7.109">realize that they had to support those</text>
  <text start="386.789" dur="7.771">guys but what they&amp;#39;ve used from 2008 to</text>
  <text start="391.169" dur="6.06">today to do is to transfer the risk from</text>
  <text start="394.56" dur="4.83">those guys to the many so from the few</text>
  <text start="397.229" dur="5.311">to the many from the corporation</text>
  <text start="399.39" dur="6.72">and the elite to the public by either</text>
  <text start="402.54" dur="5.67">putting it on the balance sheets of the</text>
  <text start="406.11" dur="4.85">government in the central banks which</text>
  <text start="408.21" dur="8.01">taxpayers are responsible for visualiser</text>
  <text start="410.96" dur="7.42">losses yeah well yes but even you know</text>
  <text start="416.22" dur="4.83">what did they pay for it okay they pay</text>
  <text start="418.38" dur="5.4">it had no value so anything that they</text>
  <text start="421.05" dur="5.81">paid for it was too much but those are</text>
  <text start="423.78" dur="6.3">still sitting on the on the books plus</text>
  <text start="426.86" dur="6.16">what you&amp;#39;re looking at at the moment is</text>
  <text start="430.08" dur="6.33">when you look at the risk are the tools</text>
  <text start="433.02" dur="6.66">that the pension plans the mutual funds</text>
  <text start="436.41" dur="7.05">the ETFs that go into retirement plans</text>
  <text start="439.68" dur="7.14">or the people are trying to hold wealth</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="6.12">or grow wealth in what are those guys</text>
  <text start="446.82" dur="6.47">doing well the pension plans and the</text>
  <text start="449.58" dur="5.79">mutual funds the institutional investors</text>
  <text start="453.29" dur="5.35">who work with other people&amp;#39;s money</text>
  <text start="455.37" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re buying when the corporations and</text>
  <text start="458.64" dur="5.4">the insiders and they&amp;#39;re catching a</text>
  <text start="460.14" dur="6.54">falling knife in these markets yeah</text>
  <text start="464.04" dur="6.51">people don&amp;#39;t realize that well I have a</text>
  <text start="466.68" dur="5.34">pension plan I have a 401k plan well</text>
  <text start="470.55" dur="7.8">what are they gonna look like when the</text>
  <text start="472.02" dur="8.61">markets are decimated and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="478.35" dur="5.67">be quite a change and I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="480.63" dur="6.09">that&amp;#39;s going to shake out but you used</text>
  <text start="484.02" dur="5.55">to justify the shift it&amp;#39;s gonna be used</text>
  <text start="486.72" dur="5.49">to cut back benefits even though it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.57" dur="5.07">even though it&amp;#39;s a joke it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="492.21" dur="5.25">used to cut back benefits for Social</text>
  <text start="494.64" dur="4.38">Security for Medicare for those people</text>
  <text start="497.46" dur="5.45">that need it the most</text>
  <text start="499.02" dur="5.85">which is typically what happens between</text>
  <text start="502.91" dur="3.79">as we say this is really a situation</text>
  <text start="504.87" dur="3.06">where they like steal ten bucks from you</text>
  <text start="506.7" dur="3.54">and give you back a couple pennies I</text>
  <text start="507.93" dur="4.5">mean really it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a bad bad bad deal</text>
  <text start="510.24" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;re getting and now there&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="512.43" dur="3.66">examples where like certain places are</text>
  <text start="514.11" dur="3.39">not able to honor the food stamp card</text>
  <text start="516.09" dur="3.15">like the system is shutting down in</text>
  <text start="517.5" dur="3.33">Indiana and certain places like where</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re getting really close I think next</text>
  <text start="520.83" dur="5.22">month - most of them shutting down that</text>
  <text start="523.92" dur="4.11">would be an incredible situation right</text>
  <text start="526.05" dur="3.39">there that could just disrupt the supply</text>
  <text start="528.03" dur="6.84">chain</text>
  <text start="529.44" dur="8.64">I would be surprised if they allowed</text>
  <text start="534.87" dur="6.57">that to happen this early in the</text>
  <text start="538.08" dur="5.64">breakdown simply because what they know</text>
  <text start="541.44" dur="5.01">is that people that are hungry and</text>
  <text start="543.72" dur="5.55">hopeless make choices it would not</text>
  <text start="546.45" dur="5.22">otherwise make you know just you saw in</text>
  <text start="549.27" dur="4.86">the Arab Spring where the public was</text>
  <text start="551.67" dur="5.79">starving and what they do they threw</text>
  <text start="554.13" dur="8.07">food at them so that they stopped</text>
  <text start="557.46" dur="7.2">rioting so I know that&amp;#39;s coming and</text>
  <text start="562.2" dur="5.76">maybe they&amp;#39;re ready for it it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="564.66" dur="4.65">tell you know joining I I do know that</text>
  <text start="567.96" dur="2.61">you know we&amp;#39;re kind of in the early</text>
  <text start="569.31" dur="3.81">stages of that and they&amp;#39;ll do something</text>
  <text start="570.57" dur="4.68">to put it off for a while you know I</text>
  <text start="573.12" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m not a supporter by any means</text>
  <text start="575.25" dur="5.43">of the welfare system but now becomes</text>
  <text start="577.41" dur="5.82">sudden like that you know it starts to</text>
  <text start="580.68" dur="3.81">set off my warning bells I start to get</text>
  <text start="583.23" dur="4.56">a little scared of what what could</text>
  <text start="584.49" dur="4.65">happen in a worst-case scenario with</text>
  <text start="587.79" dur="3.15">mass rioting it&amp;#39;s just like back to Rome</text>
  <text start="589.14" dur="3.2">like the bread and circuses as long as</text>
  <text start="590.94" dur="5.64">you have those you&amp;#39;re good to go</text>
  <text start="592.34" dur="7.27">well you know what that&amp;#39;s why I we can</text>
  <text start="596.58" dur="6.78">look at time after time after time food</text>
  <text start="599.61" dur="6.09">becomes the biggest single issue for</text>
  <text start="603.36" dur="4.5">people that&amp;#39;s why you need more</text>
  <text start="605.7" dur="5.04">durability and it can be with your</text>
  <text start="607.86" dur="5.85">skills I mean anything physical or any</text>
  <text start="610.74" dur="6.45">talent where ability that you have is</text>
  <text start="613.71" dur="6.72">bar durable I could lay an irrigation</text>

  <text start="744.24" dur="7.57">yeah so I&amp;#39;ve heard of it yeah so if we</text>
  <text start="750.01" dur="3.9">could if you don&amp;#39;t mind would you give a</text>
  <text start="751.81" dur="3.87">quick recap of what&amp;#39;s happened in the</text>
  <text start="753.91" dur="4.29">last couple months like in stocks in</text>
  <text start="755.68" dur="4.53">bonds and in real estate like just as</text>
  <text start="758.2" dur="3.39">brief as you want but let people know</text>
  <text start="760.21" dur="4.74">where we are in the everything bubble</text>
  <text start="761.59" dur="7.17">popping and well we&amp;#39;re happy</text>
  <text start="764.95" dur="6.39">yeah the everything popped and it was</text>
  <text start="768.76" dur="6.27">like a couple months ago when even</text>
  <text start="771.34" dur="6.06">though they keep saying on CNBC that you</text>
  <text start="775.03" dur="5.97">know they have not in the yields has not</text>
  <text start="777.4" dur="6.51">inverted but the yield curve between the</text>
  <text start="781" dur="6.3">twos and the v inverted meaning that the</text>
  <text start="783.91" dur="5.46">two-year yield is higher than the</text>
  <text start="787.3" dur="4.2">five-year yield and that happened about</text>
  <text start="789.37" dur="4.98">two months ago and as of this morning</text>
  <text start="791.5" dur="4.86">that is still intact and</text>
  <text start="794.35" dur="6.72">the yield curve even though yields have</text>
  <text start="796.36" dur="7.14">come down continues to flatten and</text>
  <text start="801.07" dur="5.28">remain inverted flatten as far as the</text>
  <text start="803.5" dur="6.93">tens of the twos are concerned but what</text>
  <text start="806.35" dur="8.16">that indicates is a major slowdown and</text>
  <text start="810.43" dur="7.34">it usually happens somewhere within 18</text>
  <text start="814.51" dur="7.05">months it happened in China in May of</text>
  <text start="817.77" dur="6.7">2017 and usually about that period of</text>
  <text start="821.56" dur="7.8">time roughly 18 months somewhere in</text>
  <text start="824.47" dur="8.13">there then you come into a recession so</text>
  <text start="829.36" dur="5.46">that was the first big trigger and I I</text>
  <text start="832.6" dur="6.33">did a piece on it the economy just</text>
  <text start="834.82" dur="7.11">cracked when that happened and I would</text>
  <text start="838.93" dur="4.86">say that&amp;#39;s probably the big significant</text>
  <text start="841.93" dur="4.71">piece and then what happened afterwards</text>
  <text start="843.79" dur="6.77">the markets have started falling down I</text>
  <text start="846.64" dur="7.56">mean obviously and you&amp;#39;ve got massive</text>
  <text start="850.56" dur="7.24">volatility with actually I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="854.2" dur="5.85">watching the volume start to creep up so</text>
  <text start="857.8" dur="4.86">even as the markets have been this</text>
  <text start="860.05" dur="6.36">volatile again going back to the pension</text>
  <text start="862.66" dur="7.53">plan specifically they&amp;#39;ve been basically</text>
  <text start="866.41" dur="7.08">giving some level of cover to the</text>
  <text start="870.19" dur="6.06">insiders and to the corporation&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="873.49" dur="5.04">the buybacks were they pulled back a</text>
  <text start="876.25" dur="4.08">little bit and then they zoom they</text>
  <text start="878.53" dur="4.14">zoomed up with her buybacks and that</text>
  <text start="880.33" dur="5.25">third quarter trying to support the</text>
  <text start="882.67" dur="4.8">markets but it doesn&amp;#39;t look like even</text>
  <text start="885.58" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s enough so there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="887.47" dur="6.9">tremendous amount of technical damage in</text>
  <text start="890.5" dur="6.99">all really in all of the global markets</text>
  <text start="894.37" dur="5.46">and now we&amp;#39;re even hearing like Larry</text>
  <text start="897.49" dur="4.83">Summers and anybody that listens to me</text>
  <text start="899.83" dur="4.37">at all knows that he is not my favorite</text>
  <text start="902.32" dur="5.07">ex Treasury secretary</text>
  <text start="904.2" dur="6.52">having you know blocked oversight of the</text>
  <text start="907.39" dur="5.61">OTC derivative market</text>
  <text start="910.72" dur="6.9">he&amp;#39;s coming out and saying be prepared</text>
  <text start="913" dur="7.98">for a recession the problem is is we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="917.62" dur="5.49">now entered a period in the debt markets</text>
  <text start="920.98" dur="4.99">and everything does always go back to</text>
  <text start="923.11" dur="6.189">the debt markets which are a lot bigger</text>
  <text start="925.97" dur="5.549">than the stock markets when money was</text>
  <text start="929.299" dur="3.3">cheap you had a lot of debt that was</text>
  <text start="931.519" dur="4.62">taken out</text>
  <text start="932.599" dur="7.83">you have covenants or rules in those</text>
  <text start="936.139" dur="8.28">bonds that have gotten that have given</text>
  <text start="940.429" dur="7.13">the investor a lot less protection going</text>
  <text start="944.419" dur="5.49">back to that risk transfer piece so</text>
  <text start="947.559" dur="6.43">we&amp;#39;ve got a lot of debt that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="949.909" dur="7.92">due between now and 2021 which is when</text>
  <text start="953.989" dur="7.17">the I boars go away that debt has to be</text>
  <text start="957.829" dur="5.641">rolled over or it has to be paid and</text>
  <text start="961.159" dur="4.05">when you have a slowing economy that all</text>
  <text start="963.47" dur="4.379">have the corporation&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="965.209" dur="4.74">money to do it and you&amp;#39;ve got a lot of</text>
  <text start="967.849" dur="4.71">dollar denominated I mean it all goes to</text>
  <text start="969.949" dur="5.46">the debt market and credit freezing up</text>
  <text start="972.559" dur="5.52">and and it definitely does appear that</text>
  <text start="975.409" dur="6">on the fringes the riskiest of the debt</text>
  <text start="978.079" dur="5.79">which has the less amount the least</text>
  <text start="981.409" dur="7.5">amount of protections for the investors</text>
  <text start="983.869" dur="8.76">all of that that they are starting to</text>
  <text start="988.909" dur="5.67">lose access to the debt markets so what</text>
  <text start="992.629" dur="4.61">are they gonna do we&amp;#39;re entering a</text>
  <text start="994.579" dur="5.13">period of massive defaults this year</text>
  <text start="997.239" dur="3.97">massive defaults and I want to you know</text>
  <text start="999.709" dur="2.49">what I followed the real estate market a</text>
  <text start="1001.209" dur="2.46">little bit better than I do the stock</text>
  <text start="1002.199" dur="2.73">market because I have a little bit more</text>
  <text start="1003.669" dur="3.06">background there and more experience</text>
  <text start="1004.929" dur="3.63">with it but I know prices are kind of</text>
  <text start="1006.729" dur="3.18">dropping now across the the nation I</text>
  <text start="1008.559" dur="4.25">know what&amp;#39;s happening to China pretty</text>
  <text start="1009.909" dur="5.73">bad too and I know that mortgages are</text>
  <text start="1012.809" dur="5.92">just dropping off the map I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1015.639" dur="4.53">seeing the cost the ratio of cost to</text>
  <text start="1018.729" dur="3.45">actually buy a home like young people</text>
  <text start="1020.169" dur="3.96">aren&amp;#39;t buying homes and there&amp;#39;s too many</text>
  <text start="1022.179" dur="3.75">homes even on the market out there just</text>
  <text start="1024.129" dur="4.08">kind of dilapidated and rotting anyway</text>
  <text start="1025.929" dur="3.541">so I want people to understand like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1028.209" dur="3.42">not good there it&amp;#39;s not good in the</text>
  <text start="1029.47" dur="4.409">stock market the bond market is going to</text>
  <text start="1031.629" dur="3.871">get really rough eventually but what</text>
  <text start="1033.879" dur="4.621">about counterparty risk can you make</text>
  <text start="1035.5" dur="5.73">sure it&amp;#39;s hot real fast okay yeah</text>
  <text start="1038.5" dur="5.279">because all of this fiat money wealth</text>
  <text start="1041.23" dur="5.339">whatever it is if it&amp;#39;s a piece of paper</text>
  <text start="1043.779" dur="5.221">what it is is a contract and any</text>
  <text start="1046.569" dur="5.251">contract is only as good as the</text>
  <text start="1049" dur="5.309">counterparty to that contract so when</text>
  <text start="1051.82" dur="4.89">credit dries up I mean as long as you</text>
  <text start="1054.309" dur="5.011">can go out and get it for an individual</text>
  <text start="1056.71" dur="7.02">let&amp;#39;s say you can keep borrowing money</text>
  <text start="1059.32" dur="6.359">to pay your bills okay it&amp;#39;s bad but at</text>
  <text start="1063.73" dur="5.61">least you can keep the appearance of</text>
  <text start="1065.679" dur="6.48">being successful when you can&amp;#39;t borrow</text>
  <text start="1069.34" dur="5.459">money anymore that&amp;#39;s when the defaults</text>
  <text start="1072.159" dur="5.64">happen and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening so it</text>
  <text start="1074.799" dur="6.391">doesn&amp;#39;t really matter where the defaults</text>
  <text start="1077.799" dur="6.12">start whether it&amp;#39;s in the shadow bank so</text>
  <text start="1081.19" dur="7.05">the private corporations or private</text>
  <text start="1083.919" dur="8.671">money that has taken over in lending to</text>
  <text start="1088.24" dur="6.75">these riskiest of all corporations the</text>
  <text start="1092.59" dur="5.929">ones that are frankly not likely to be</text>
  <text start="1094.99" dur="7.409">able to pay you back in a downturn -</text>
  <text start="1098.519" dur="6.431">even JP Morgan was downgraded okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1102.399" dur="5.341">throughout the whole system and since</text>
  <text start="1104.95" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;re all so connected</text>
  <text start="1107.74" dur="3.659">doesn&amp;#39;t matter where it starts if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1109.99" dur="3.389">in a shadow bank it&amp;#39;s going to the</text>
  <text start="1111.399" dur="4.41">banking system where do you hold your</text>
  <text start="1113.379" dur="5.101">cash if you hold it in the banking</text>
  <text start="1115.809" dur="5.07">system it&amp;#39;s going to get bailed in they</text>
  <text start="1118.48" dur="4.649">didn&amp;#39;t put those laws in place because</text>
  <text start="1120.879" dur="3.66">they didn&amp;#39;t intend to use them where</text>
  <text start="1123.129" dur="5.311">they didn&amp;#39;t think they were going to</text>
  <text start="1124.539" dur="5.821">need them and once it&amp;#39;s gone it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1128.44" dur="4.589">really matter you can pound on the doors</text>
  <text start="1130.36" dur="4.47">you can send any emails you can make any</text>
  <text start="1133.029" dur="3.471">phone calls you&amp;#39;re not getting through</text>
  <text start="1134.83" dur="5.61">and you&amp;#39;re not getting your wealth back</text>
  <text start="1136.5" dur="6.82">so it&amp;#39;s really bad and real estate is</text>
  <text start="1140.44" dur="4.739">20% of the economy we have we have</text>
  <text start="1143.32" dur="3.42">counterparty risk basically systemic</text>
  <text start="1145.179" dur="3.421">throughout everything that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1146.74" dur="4.139">involved in any paper assets anything</text>
  <text start="1148.6" dur="4.169">anyone owes you anything that anyone has</text>
  <text start="1150.879" dur="3.121">to do to fulfill their contract to you</text>
  <text start="1152.769" dur="3.54">so that you can get the money out of</text>
  <text start="1154" dur="4.889">this thing that you have all of that is</text>
  <text start="1156.309" dur="3.75">at risk and in the stock market I</text>
  <text start="1158.889" dur="2.731">understand there&amp;#39;s a lot of like rehab</text>
  <text start="1160.059" dur="4.23">rehypothecation and things of that</text>
  <text start="1161.62" dur="5.1">nature going on as well so many levels</text>
  <text start="1164.289" dur="6.87">of rehypothecation which is using the</text>
  <text start="1166.72" dur="6.089">same asset to borrow what does that mean</text>
  <text start="1171.159" dur="3.63">for someone who maybe has a stock in</text>
  <text start="1172.809" dur="3.72">just a big company or something and and</text>
  <text start="1174.789" dur="3.691">does this mean that if things get really</text>
  <text start="1176.529" dur="3.451">bad they can still take their stock and</text>
  <text start="1178.48" dur="3.929">or does it mean that that&amp;#39;s owed to</text>
  <text start="1179.98" dur="5.37">multiple people in many cases they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1182.409" dur="5.52">never gonna actually get it exactly if</text>
  <text start="1185.35" dur="4.36">you hold it in street name if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1187.929" dur="5.261">hold the certificate in</text>
  <text start="1189.71" dur="5.88">your possession is weird moment street</text>
  <text start="1193.19" dur="6">name that&amp;#39;s the contract you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1195.59" dur="6">really the legal registered owner so I</text>
  <text start="1199.19" dur="4.83">mean we saw what happened in 2008 with</text>
  <text start="1201.59" dur="5.43">all those contracts and nobody went to</text>
  <text start="1204.02" dur="6.6">jail because even though it was evil and</text>
  <text start="1207.02" dur="6.87">horrible and unethical and all of that</text>
  <text start="1210.62" dur="5.039">it wasn&amp;#39;t illegal and so what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1213.89" dur="5.159">also done during this period of time</text>
  <text start="1215.659" dur="5.13">with those contracts to the counterparty</text>
  <text start="1219.049" dur="6.571">issue that you&amp;#39;re talking about is</text>
  <text start="1220.789" dur="9.24">they&amp;#39;ve given even more power to the</text>
  <text start="1225.62" dur="6.51">counterparties but you the individual</text>
  <text start="1230.029" dur="6.27">you have no idea what you&amp;#39;ve what you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1232.13" dur="7.08">agreed to create things second small</text>
  <text start="1236.299" dur="5.311">print so that you don&amp;#39;t but that</text>
  <text start="1239.21" dur="5.13">systemic piece where they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1241.61" dur="5.64">interconnected counterparties are not</text>

  <text start="1250.039" dur="4.291">those derivatives and not certainly not</text>
  <text start="1252.559" dur="4.881">all of them but a chunk of those</text>
  <text start="1254.33" dur="6.66">derivatives now going through central</text>
  <text start="1257.44" dur="6.099">counterparties it actually even makes</text>
  <text start="1260.99" dur="5.49">the system that much more vulnerable</text>
  <text start="1263.539" dur="6.12">because this is where they&amp;#39;re holding</text>
  <text start="1266.48" dur="6.15">all of these big bets which is just a</text>
  <text start="1269.659" dur="5.88">leverage bet is what is what a</text>
  <text start="1272.63" dur="5.49">derivative is inside of the system and</text>
  <text start="1275.539" dur="5.461">now they go through there&amp;#39;s only six of</text>
  <text start="1278.12" dur="4.799">them six central counterparties globally</text>
  <text start="1281" dur="5.309">and then they&amp;#39;re tied to every single</text>
  <text start="1282.919" dur="6.271">bank so that counterparty risk is</text>
  <text start="1286.309" dur="5.25">systemic and it is there&amp;#39;s no way around</text>
  <text start="1289.19" dur="5.19">that now it&amp;#39;s the way they set up the</text>
  <text start="1291.559" dur="5.551">system you know there was a book and I</text>
  <text start="1294.38" dur="4.86">think a movie based on a famous con</text>

  <text start="1345.74" dur="5.85">reporting on that you know this week is</text>
  <text start="1348.29" dur="6.78">that it looks like on the fringe so</text>
  <text start="1351.59" dur="6.3">again the riskiest borrowers are being</text>
  <text start="1355.07" dur="4.86">cut off from the credit markets now</text>
  <text start="1357.89" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s really the scary part that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1359.93" dur="4.23">really a partier you get up and make it</text>
  <text start="1361.67" dur="4.74">easier for them right right and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1364.16" dur="7.44">what Larry Summers were saying is that</text>
  <text start="1366.41" dur="7.77">austerity is more risky than you know</text>
  <text start="1371.6" dur="4.41">just printing endless money well I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1374.18" dur="4.68">know I think they&amp;#39;re both pretty risky</text>
  <text start="1376.01" dur="5.16">but when you cut off their ability to</text>
  <text start="1378.86" dur="5.48">borrow how are they going to pay that</text>
  <text start="1381.17" dur="5.73">back especially since as the</text>
  <text start="1384.34" dur="5.26">corporation&amp;#39;s has have levered up in</text>
  <text start="1386.9" dur="4.89">other words taken on more and more and</text>
  <text start="1389.6" dur="5.46">more debt they&amp;#39;re holding less and less</text>
  <text start="1391.79" dur="6.84">and less cash so you know if you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1395.06" dur="5.73">trouble and you get into trouble and you</text>
  <text start="1398.63" dur="3.9">have savings you can pull from maybe you</text>
  <text start="1400.79" dur="3.66">can make it through if you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1402.53" dur="4.08">any savings to pull from how are you</text>
  <text start="1404.45" dur="3.78">going to make it through if nobody will</text>
  <text start="1406.61" dur="3.84">give you money and these people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1408.23" dur="3.39">have savings and there&amp;#39;s nobody that has</text>
  <text start="1410.45" dur="2.67">savings out there except for a few</text>
  <text start="1411.62" dur="3.03">people I mean if you have savings over</text>
  <text start="1413.12" dur="3.69">five hundred bucks you&amp;#39;re probably top</text>
  <text start="1414.65" dur="3.33">10 percent yeah but I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="1416.81" dur="6.06">the corporations</text>
  <text start="1417.98" dur="9.18">yeah but I&amp;#39;m actually also talking about</text>
  <text start="1422.87" dur="8.19">corporations the IMF the BIS the ECB</text>
  <text start="1427.16" dur="7.92">everybody has done Studies on what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1431.06" dur="7.55">happened since 2008 and the corporations</text>
  <text start="1435.08" dur="6.9">are at you know near or at the highest</text>
  <text start="1438.61" dur="6.55">levels of leverage meaning if they earn</text>
  <text start="1441.98" dur="6.78">a buck they have borrowed ten bucks</text>
  <text start="1445.16" dur="6.27">against it so for every dollars worth of</text>
  <text start="1448.76" dur="4.92">income and they have no savings</text>
  <text start="1451.43" dur="5.33">so as they&amp;#39;ve taken on more and more</text>
  <text start="1453.68" dur="5.51">leverage their cash reserves have</text>
  <text start="1456.76" dur="5.28">down and down and down and a lot of</text>
  <text start="1459.19" dur="6.93">these corporations since 2008 have</text>
  <text start="1462.04" dur="5.97">borrowed to buy back stock and and</text>
  <text start="1466.12" dur="4.2">there&amp;#39;s a thing about debt that people</text>
  <text start="1468.01" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t understand there&amp;#39;s basically two</text>
  <text start="1470.32" dur="4.53">types of debt they&amp;#39;re self liquidating</text>
  <text start="1472.39" dur="6.54">debt and there&amp;#39;s non self liquidating</text>
  <text start="1474.85" dur="7.95">debt self liquidating debt would be like</text>
  <text start="1478.93" dur="7.11">I borrowed some money to to expand my</text>
  <text start="1482.8" dur="6.39">business so I can handle more customers</text>
  <text start="1486.04" dur="5.31">more customers means that I&amp;#39;ve got more</text>
  <text start="1489.19" dur="5.58">income and that income is repaying that</text>
  <text start="1491.35" dur="5.13">debt until that debt goes to zero so not</text>
  <text start="1494.77" dur="4.68">all debt is bad</text>
  <text start="1496.48" dur="6.06">self liquidating debt can be good but</text>
  <text start="1499.45" dur="5.85">when these corporations borrowed for the</text>
  <text start="1502.54" dur="6.18">benefit of the shareholders which are</text>
  <text start="1505.3" dur="6.15">you know a lot of the insiders etc to</text>
  <text start="1508.72" dur="6.48">buy back stocks or pay out dividends</text>
  <text start="1511.45" dur="6.24">that is non self liquidating debt which</text>
  <text start="1515.2" dur="6.6">means that they have to earn the money</text>
  <text start="1517.69" dur="7.86">to repay that debt and pull it from</text>
  <text start="1521.8" dur="6.93">other sources so if you&amp;#39;ve got a global</text>
  <text start="1525.55" dur="6.87">slowdown know how many savings to carry</text>
  <text start="1528.73" dur="9.6">them or to make these debt payments for</text>
  <text start="1532.42" dur="7.62">very long you&amp;#39;ve got a huge problem so</text>
  <text start="1538.33" dur="3.63">that reaches beyond just the poor that</text>
  <text start="1540.04" dur="3.57">reaches into everyone&amp;#39;s problems I mean</text>
  <text start="1541.96" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s gonna create issues for everyone</text>
  <text start="1543.61" dur="4.95">right it&amp;#39;s not gonna matter you know</text>
  <text start="1546.76" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s not going to matter where you are</text>
  <text start="1548.56" dur="7.59">in this cycle absolutely everybody will</text>
  <text start="1552.13" dur="9.18">be impacted the choice that we have as</text>
  <text start="1556.15" dur="8.07">individuals is how will we be impacted</text>
  <text start="1561.31" dur="5.22">and what can we do that&amp;#39;s part of the</text>
  <text start="1564.22" dur="4.77">strategy because there were all of these</text>
  <text start="1566.53" dur="5.07">repeatable patterns and you know the</text>
  <text start="1568.99" dur="4.53">strategy that I created from having</text>
  <text start="1571.6" dur="4.8">studied currencies in Athens</text>
  <text start="1573.52" dur="6.39">eighty-seven is just about repeatable</text>
  <text start="1576.4" dur="6.24">patterns and we want to do number one we</text>
  <text start="1579.91" dur="5.94">want to sustain as much as possible our</text>
  <text start="1582.64" dur="6.18">current standard of living and then</text>
  <text start="1585.85" dur="3.9">number two we want to be able to take</text>
  <text start="1588.82" dur="3.63">advantage</text>
  <text start="1589.75" dur="7.31">of what happens when all of these</text>
  <text start="1592.45" dur="7.35">inflated prices burn out of these assets</text>
  <text start="1597.06" dur="9.99">so I don&amp;#39;t know what would you rather do</text>
  <text start="1599.8" dur="9.9">on Apple at you know 250 or maybe 40 if</text>
  <text start="1607.05" dur="5.32">it&amp;#39;s still a viable company which</text>
  <text start="1609.7" dur="6.09">probably it will be I mean I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="1612.37" dur="5.97">it will be I&amp;#39;d rather buy a 40 so that</text>
  <text start="1615.79" dur="4.98">means I got to hold my powder dry and</text>
  <text start="1618.34" dur="6.93">not in cash because they&amp;#39;re constantly</text>
  <text start="1620.77" dur="8.79">we need more inflation and and we&amp;#39;ve now</text>
  <text start="1625.27" dur="7.5">had the specter of stagflation raised by</text>
  <text start="1629.56" dur="6.39">two central bankers so and if you look</text>
  <text start="1632.77" dur="5.58">at the PM eyes in different countries</text>
  <text start="1635.95" dur="5.61">and they compared to the CPI so</text>
  <text start="1638.35" dur="6.5">inflation compared to the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="1641.56" dur="7.11">that&amp;#39;s what you see you see inflation</text>
  <text start="1644.85" dur="6.7">expanding and you see income declining</text>
  <text start="1648.67" dur="5.79">you&amp;#39;ve got stagflation prices rather</text>
  <text start="1651.55" dur="6.51">prices declining to try to get people to</text>
  <text start="1654.46" dur="5.22">buy more so this is not good and we</text>
  <text start="1658.06" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;ve been getting warnings from the</text>
  <text start="1659.68" dur="6.99">central banks and the markets of course</text>
  <text start="1663.43" dur="4.8">but and people like yourself but the big</text>
  <text start="1666.67" dur="3.63">three you know stocks bonds real estate</text>
  <text start="1668.23" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re not a good place to be</text>
  <text start="1670.3" dur="3.53">right now am I correct in assuming and</text>
  <text start="1672.64" dur="4.5">this is kind of what I&amp;#39;m preparing for</text>
  <text start="1673.83" dur="6.16">with any savings on yet silver is going</text>
  <text start="1677.14" dur="5.04">to receive this massive revaluation when</text>
  <text start="1679.99" dur="4.17">once we get an actual price mechanism in</text>
  <text start="1682.18" dur="3.87">there other than this manipulated market</text>
  <text start="1684.16" dur="4.17">which still has to officially come to an</text>
  <text start="1686.05" dur="4.47">end at some point but it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1688.33" dur="4.29">receive a lot of the money and the value</text>
  <text start="1690.52" dur="3.33">that was in these inflated stocks and</text>
  <text start="1692.62" dur="3.15">such you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of money</text>
  <text start="1693.85" dur="5.34">come to these small group of folks</text>
  <text start="1695.77" dur="7.56">who&amp;#39;ve been hoarding certain things well</text>
  <text start="1699.19" dur="6.57">yes and we&amp;#39;re seeing some off of the the</text>
  <text start="1703.33" dur="5.37">bottoms where you have where do you see</text>
  <text start="1705.76" dur="4.94">my hesitancy as long as Wall Street is</text>
  <text start="1708.7" dur="3.21">telling you how much something is worth</text>
  <text start="1710.7" dur="6.34">personally</text>
  <text start="1711.91" dur="7.44">I don&amp;#39;t trust it silver and gold you</text>
  <text start="1717.04" dur="6.15">know in the physical form</text>
  <text start="1719.35" dur="6.54">it&amp;#39;s got absolute use so if I am</text>
  <text start="1723.19" dur="8.51">counting on Wall Street to tell me when</text>
  <text start="1725.89" dur="9.09">silver is valued or gold is valued yeah</text>
  <text start="1731.7" dur="8.53">what&amp;#39;s really gonna happen is during the</text>
  <text start="1734.98" dur="10.01">reset that&amp;#39;s how a reset is accomplished</text>
  <text start="1740.23" dur="9.33">by taking fiat money that has zero value</text>
  <text start="1744.99" dur="8.32">and revaluing it against gold money that</text>
  <text start="1749.56" dur="6.44">is all value and then that&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="1753.31" dur="5.07">silver gets it as well it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1756" dur="5.98">revaluation I&amp;#39;m not waiting for Wall</text>
  <text start="1758.38" dur="8.07">Street this not a trade for me at all</text>
  <text start="1761.98" dur="6.87">this is the foundation of a strategy the</text>
  <text start="1766.45" dur="4.83">silver for me I always look at function</text>
  <text start="1768.85" dur="5.46">what am I trying to accomplish what are</text>
  <text start="1771.28" dur="5.82">the best tools for the job so I do love</text>
  <text start="1774.31" dur="6.69">silver I own a lot of silver I intend to</text>
  <text start="1777.1" dur="6.27">own a lot more silver but but I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1781" dur="5.06">looking for Wall Street&amp;#39;s for evaluation</text>
  <text start="1783.37" dur="7.83">I&amp;#39;m looking for the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1786.06" dur="7.66">revaluation inside Arisa and then the</text>
  <text start="1791.2" dur="7.77">markets will properly revalue just like</text>
  <text start="1793.72" dur="6.36">we&amp;#39;re seeing in Argentina so now you</text>
  <text start="1798.97" dur="2.7">know I&amp;#39;ve heard it said that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1800.08" dur="2.88">fates basically a guarantee that the</text>
  <text start="1801.67" dur="2.85">government in the Fed are gonna keep</text>
  <text start="1802.96" dur="3.21">making the dollar worse you know keep</text>
  <text start="1804.52" dur="2.88">printing keep causing problems and stuff</text>
  <text start="1806.17" dur="4.92">like that so it&amp;#39;s a good you know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1807.4" dur="5.55">good kind of additional note to add on</text>
  <text start="1811.09" dur="4.56">to the footnote of gold and silver you</text>
  <text start="1812.95" dur="4.53">know there&amp;#39;s no counterparty risk as</text>
  <text start="1815.65" dur="3.63">well so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s also kind of nice</text>
  <text start="1817.48" dur="3.51">but I have a kind of a question I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1819.28" dur="4.98">wondered for a long time Lincoln just</text>
  <text start="1820.99" dur="4.98">how much or what are the odds that we as</text>
  <text start="1824.26" dur="3.57">like the little people out there not the</text>
  <text start="1825.97" dur="4.35">big players but the little folks could</text>
  <text start="1827.83" dur="5.73">really corner that market and run them</text>
  <text start="1830.32" dur="6.12">out of silver physical well I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1833.56" dur="6.24">about running them out of silver because</text>
  <text start="1836.44" dur="5.58">I mean after all JPMorgan has the</text>
  <text start="1839.8" dur="5.64">largest physical hoard and they also</text>
  <text start="1842.02" dur="6.75">control the digital markets so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1845.44" dur="6.24">know that you that the the individual</text>
  <text start="1848.77" dur="6.15">could actually run them over why nobody</text>
  <text start="1851.68" dur="3.81">tried but despite hopes maybe as as a</text>
  <text start="1854.92" dur="2.009">massive</text>
  <text start="1855.49" dur="2.73">grupe if enough people started buying up</text>
  <text start="1856.929" dur="5.88">silver and they ran out of the physical</text>
  <text start="1858.22" dur="9.36">like they yeah I actually do think that</text>
  <text start="1862.809" dur="8.791">we will get to a point you know you know</text>
  <text start="1867.58" dur="6.66">there&amp;#39;s there is likely always to be a</text>
  <text start="1871.6" dur="4.61">kind of a price but I can tell you</text>
  <text start="1874.24" dur="5.76">because I just got this one in today</text>
  <text start="1876.21" dur="4.54">okay that a Megan&amp;#39;s opening what else</text>
  <text start="1880" dur="2.46">did I get</text>
  <text start="1880.75" dur="4.8">I can&amp;#39;t remember I try and buy all the</text>
  <text start="1882.46" dur="6.93">time okay but and these are some Swiss</text>
  <text start="1885.55" dur="6.27">francs okay what I can tell you is I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1889.39" dur="4.05">not selling this so it&amp;#39;s not coming back</text>
  <text start="1891.82" dur="4.2">on the market are you selling your</text>

  <text start="2005.47" dur="4.9">used to do that as a child yeah you go</text>
  <text start="2008.659" dur="2.941">and imagine like having a treasure map</text>
  <text start="2010.37" dur="2.7">you kids could find it later or</text>
  <text start="2011.6" dur="4.199">something or even just doing that as a</text>
  <text start="2013.07" dur="5.16">game but well because a couple in</text>
  <text start="2015.799" dur="4.081">California actually did find they had</text>
  <text start="2018.23" dur="3.6">bought a new piece of property and this</text>
  <text start="2019.88" dur="5.7">happened a few years ago and they were</text>
  <text start="2021.83" dur="7.68">out walking this property and they saw</text>
  <text start="2025.58" dur="6.89">this can dirty old coffee can and when</text>
  <text start="2029.51" dur="6.51">they opened up it had something like the</text>
  <text start="2032.47" dur="6.1">Fiat value at that time was something</text>
  <text start="2036.02" dur="3.51">like ten million dollars or something</text>
  <text start="2038.57" dur="4.17">like that</text>
  <text start="2039.53" dur="7.44">that was that was just the minimum Fiat</text>
  <text start="2042.74" dur="6.149">value so yeah it&amp;#39;s incredible well</text>
  <text start="2046.97" dur="3.959">listen you know in terms of you know we</text>
  <text start="2048.889" dur="3.631">I think we&amp;#39;ve done a good job making a</text>
  <text start="2050.929" dur="3.48">case for gold and silver in terms of</text>
  <text start="2052.52" dur="3.359">getting Sun in terms of maybe even I</text>
  <text start="2054.409" dur="3.361">don&amp;#39;t know converting some of these</text>
  <text start="2055.879" dur="3.99">useless instruments before they go bad</text>
  <text start="2057.77" dur="3.839">maybe through a self-directed IRA or</text>
  <text start="2059.869" dur="4.02">something or working through you know an</text>
  <text start="2061.609" dur="4.711">agency like yours I am trading what can</text>
  <text start="2063.889" dur="4.441">people do to get out as it is it is it a</text>
  <text start="2066.32" dur="5.609">good time is it too late</text>
  <text start="2068.33" dur="6.089">I know it&amp;#39;s always as long as you can</text>
  <text start="2071.929" dur="4.2">liquidate your fit my concern is that</text>
  <text start="2074.419" dur="4.95">you&amp;#39;re not going to be able to liquidate</text>
  <text start="2076.129" dur="5.73">your fiat assets honestly that is a huge</text>
  <text start="2079.369" dur="6.81">concern because when credit dries up</text>
  <text start="2081.859" dur="8.73">think back to 2008 BAM all those bars</text>
  <text start="2086.179" dur="10.261">are closed so so while you can still</text>
  <text start="2090.589" dur="9.421">liquidate get out and then you convert</text>
  <text start="2096.44" dur="7.23">it into something that is real that has</text>
  <text start="2100.01" dur="8.49">constant demand on a global basis and is</text>
  <text start="2103.67" dur="7.919">always always always liquid but I really</text>
  <text start="2108.5" dur="6.869">think too that you need to have a plan</text>
  <text start="2111.589" dur="7.53">and so I&amp;#39;m actually doing a workshop in</text>
  <text start="2115.369" dur="6.271">about a month for just a small group of</text>
  <text start="2119.119" dur="3.291">accredited investors and we&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="2121.64" dur="3.64">going to</text>
  <text start="2122.41" dur="6.959">I&amp;#39;m gonna actually teach them how to</text>
  <text start="2125.28" dur="6.279">develop their own strategy so by the</text>
  <text start="2129.369" dur="4.411">time they leave that workshop they</text>
  <text start="2131.559" dur="4.591">should be in a position to be prepared</text>
  <text start="2133.78" dur="5.85">so and that&amp;#39;s what we do here we help</text>
  <text start="2136.15" dur="6.719">everyone into a position but yeah</text>
  <text start="2139.63" dur="6.689">definitely know now it&amp;#39;s dirt cheap I</text>
  <text start="2142.869" dur="6.45">mean we&amp;#39;ve got spot still under thirteen</text>
  <text start="2146.319" dur="5.28">hundred bucks an ounce when it should be</text>
  <text start="2149.319" dur="4.921">probably haven&amp;#39;t done the calculation</text>
  <text start="2151.599" dur="5.94">just lately but probably well over ten</text>
  <text start="2154.24" dur="6.75">thousand an ounce it&amp;#39;s a bargain you</text>
  <text start="2157.539" dur="5.881">know Alan Greenspan come out like two</text>
  <text start="2160.99" dur="5.42">days ago something like that and say the</text>
  <text start="2163.42" dur="4.32">stock markets still overvalued uh-huh</text>
  <text start="2166.41" dur="3.31">mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="2167.74" dur="4.92">yeah well yeah I mean it is it is</text>
  <text start="2169.72" dur="5.639">absolutely overvalued I and over at</text>
  <text start="2172.66" dur="5.28">fifteen sixteen bucks even if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2175.359" dur="6.121">have a lot of money you know you can</text>
  <text start="2177.94" dur="6.179">still position into real money that is</text>
  <text start="2181.48" dur="4.319">outside of the system that&amp;#39;s a beauty</text>
  <text start="2184.119" dur="3.871">part about silver too</text>
  <text start="2185.799" dur="5.07">I mean come on I mean gold and silver</text>
  <text start="2187.99" dur="4.559">preserves you&amp;#39;re not only your your like</text>
  <text start="2190.869" dur="3.541">your purchasing power in your your</text>

  <text start="2204.7" dur="4.5">be able to function in society without</text>
  <text start="2206.68" dur="5.369">being reliant on anyone else it it</text>
  <text start="2209.2" dur="6.389">protects you in that sense exactly and</text>
  <text start="2212.049" dur="7.411">something like this well I like a better</text>
  <text start="2215.589" dur="6.45">quality than this one actually for this</text>
  <text start="2219.46" dur="6.24">function but this is what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="2222.039" dur="6.421">enable me to convert into severely</text>
  <text start="2225.7" dur="7.02">undervalued I don&amp;#39;t know commercial real</text>
  <text start="2228.46" dur="6.389">estate like I don&amp;#39;t know maybe anything</text>
  <text start="2232.72" dur="4.079">that&amp;#39;s bought on a lot of leverage so</text>
  <text start="2234.849" dur="3.99">all those buildings that you see going</text>
  <text start="2236.799" dur="4.441">up where all that debt has been</text>
  <text start="2238.839" dur="4.321">securitized I&amp;#39;m going to tell you</text>
  <text start="2241.24" dur="4.289">there&amp;#39;s going to be some huge bargains</text>
  <text start="2243.16" dur="6.33">and this is going to hold your will so</text>
  <text start="2245.529" dur="6.721">you can actually buy that when we see</text>
  <text start="2249.49" dur="4.559">that confirmation we know that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2252.25" dur="3.75">somewhere near a bottom it&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="2254.049" dur="4.441">shopping spree and it&amp;#39;ll be in</text>
  <text start="2256" dur="6.45">great for those who had kind of waited</text>
  <text start="2258.49" dur="5.63">and decided to put off and delay</text>
  <text start="2262.45" dur="4.23">gratification for a little while longer</text>
  <text start="2264.12" dur="5.2">and I think it&amp;#39;s great that people can</text>
  <text start="2266.68" dur="5.25">can plug right into what you&amp;#39;re doing at</text>
  <text start="2269.32" dur="4.56">ITM trading and get some help with that</text>
  <text start="2271.93" dur="4.62">I definitely you know I hope people will</text>
  <text start="2273.88" dur="4.65">I&amp;#39;m very concerned about you know what</text>
  <text start="2276.55" dur="4.74">could potentially happen to folks</text>
  <text start="2278.53" dur="3.96">especially in what&amp;#39;s coming especially</text>
  <text start="2281.29" dur="3.06">if they&amp;#39;re in like the city or things</text>
  <text start="2282.49" dur="3.24">did really get bad and like something</text>
  <text start="2284.35" dur="2.91">like food stamps or something and I</text>
  <text start="2285.73" dur="2.91">don&amp;#39;t want people even in best-case</text>

  <text start="2288.64" dur="4.83">coffin apartments with nothing but a</text>
  <text start="2290.53" dur="5.37">microwave so yeah well that&amp;#39;s why I</text>
  <text start="2293.47" dur="5.91">converted my property to a to an urban</text>
  <text start="2295.9" dur="5.91">farm and I love farming I love space and</text>

  <text start="2350.38" dur="3">things happen for the world and then</text>
  <text start="2352.09" dur="3.3">they never really get the appreciation</text>
  <text start="2353.38" dur="4.08">they get a lot of the scorn and the</text>
  <text start="2355.39" dur="4.02">resentment but even in ancient Sparta</text>
  <text start="2357.46" dur="4.59">like there was a situation where a</text>
  <text start="2359.41" dur="7.47">visitor asked the king you know why do</text>
  <text start="2362.05" dur="9.39">you guys something along the lines of</text>

  <text start="2373.21" dur="4.2">workers or whatever back in those days</text>
  <text start="2374.92" dur="4.86">run the farm and the idea and the answer</text>
  <text start="2377.41" dur="4.74">was well as by working on our mind and</text>
  <text start="2379.78" dur="3.99">not the farm that we acquired that farm</text>
  <text start="2382.15" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s just one of those really famous</text>

  <text start="2413.8" dur="5.16">story and this is not one I mean I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2416.5" dur="4.44">shared it with some people but I am</text>
  <text start="2418.96" dur="4.2">going to share it with you because this</text>
  <text start="2420.94" dur="5.73">is really I know that I have been</text>
  <text start="2423.16" dur="6.93">groomed for this moment in time and you</text>
  <text start="2426.67" dur="6.21">know nobody lives a life unscathed and I</text>
  <text start="2430.09" dur="5.55">don&amp;#39;t didn&amp;#39;t either and being an</text>
  <text start="2432.88" dur="5.16">entrepreneur which I absolutely am I had</text>
  <text start="2435.64" dur="5.16">a major crash and burn I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="2438.04" dur="4.74">through the whole story but I actually</text>
  <text start="2440.8" dur="3.75">went to France that&amp;#39;s why I love France</text>
  <text start="2442.78" dur="4.14">I know they&amp;#39;re going through some issues</text>
  <text start="2444.55" dur="4.98">but I love the people of France because</text>
  <text start="2446.92" dur="4.68">they they helped me but I was wondering</text>
  <text start="2449.53" dur="6.51">why I was here why was even on the</text>
  <text start="2451.6" dur="7.23">planet and so I went to France and I had</text>
  <text start="2456.04" dur="4.8">a bike and a backpack and I camped and I</text>
  <text start="2458.83" dur="4.14">bathed in the stream so probably didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2460.84" dur="4.59">look very pretty and might not have even</text>
  <text start="2462.97" dur="4.26">smelled very pretty and it was toward</text>
  <text start="2465.43" dur="4.11">the end of my trip and there was</text>
  <text start="2467.23" dur="3.72">something that I needed without going</text>
  <text start="2469.54" dur="3.42">into detail there was something that I</text>
  <text start="2470.95" dur="3.84">needed and I had I think like three</text>
  <text start="2472.96" dur="4.26">francs left or five francs left</text>
  <text start="2474.79" dur="4.71">something like that and I went into this</text>
  <text start="2477.22" dur="4.649">little village and it was a female</text>
  <text start="2479.5" dur="4.109">proprietress and and by that point I</text>
  <text start="2481.869" dur="4.801">could speak French at least to be</text>
  <text start="2483.609" dur="5.461">understood and she refused it was just a</text>
