  <text start="1.19" dur="4.12">hey guys all right hang on there we go</text>
  <text start="4.14" dur="3.449">now we&amp;#39;re life all right</text>
  <text start="5.31" dur="4.32">hey guys this is destiny most destiny</text>
  <text start="7.589" dur="3.691">most calm and I am joined today by four</text>
  <text start="9.63" dur="3.929">twelve and nine or four one two and on</text>
  <text start="11.28" dur="4.59">if you prefer and we are gonna talk</text>
  <text start="13.559" dur="5.041">about all of the the state of you know</text>
  <text start="15.87" dur="4.29">the censorship what that means and why</text>
  <text start="18.6" dur="4.11">we think that it&amp;#39;s being coordinated</text>
  <text start="20.16" dur="5.58">kind of behind the scenes to distract</text>
  <text start="22.71" dur="5.85">from Q and on itself and you know all of</text>
  <text start="25.74" dur="5.279">these supposed debunks of Q and then the</text>
  <text start="28.56" dur="4.44">the tripped the trip code being you know</text>
  <text start="31.019" dur="5.941">cracked everything else and why that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="33" dur="5.37">not disproving to you but you know that</text>
  <text start="36.96" dur="2.939">let&amp;#39;s just start off right there because</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="3.99">that is the big thing right now people</text>
  <text start="39.899" dur="5.16">like oh my gosh Q is his trip was</text>
  <text start="42.36" dur="4.83">cracked and and people are posting</text>
  <text start="45.059" dur="4.111">things like even Jack Pacific is posting</text>
  <text start="47.19" dur="4.98">some stuff he got from some trolls</text>
  <text start="49.17" dur="4.86">basically let explain this stuff like at</text>
  <text start="52.17" dur="4.229">the technical aspect of these things</text>
  <text start="54.03" dur="6.419">kind of alludes a lot of people like</text>
  <text start="56.399" dur="5.011">what do you think yeah so huge trip code</text>
  <text start="60.449" dur="2.281">was cracked</text>
  <text start="61.41" dur="3.389">meaning someone&amp;#39;s able to hack the</text>
  <text start="62.73" dur="6.3">password and post under that idea</text>
  <text start="64.799" dur="7.5">essentially but the big thing is is they</text>
  <text start="69.03" dur="6.06">did that on cue research the hew</text>
  <text start="72.299" dur="6.091">Research Board now Q also posts on</text>
  <text start="75.09" dur="5.43">Patriots fight which only he has access</text>
  <text start="78.39" dur="3.56">to or only the Q team has access to</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="4.26">which has a completely different</text>
  <text start="81.95" dur="4.9">encryption so just because you get the</text>
  <text start="84.78" dur="6.299">trip code doesn&amp;#39;t mean you can post on</text>
  <text start="86.85" dur="6.93">that board and once the trip code was</text>
  <text start="91.079" dur="5.22">hacked the frauds you know they never</text>
  <text start="93.78" dur="6.06">posted on Patriots fight they really</text>
  <text start="96.299" dur="5.191">wanted to disprove Q or really debunk</text>
  <text start="99.84" dur="3.36">you they would have needed to get on the</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="3.78">Patriots fight and start posting there</text>
  <text start="103.2" dur="4.14">and even then I mean just because the</text>
  <text start="105.27" dur="6.05">board&amp;#39;s compromised doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="6.209">mean Q is but because Patriots fight</text>
  <text start="111.32" dur="4.78">wasn&amp;#39;t compromised I&amp;#39;m not worried about</text>
  <text start="113.549" dur="4.561">this even a little bit yeah and I agree</text>
  <text start="116.1" dur="7.19">with you there but so for people who</text>
  <text start="118.11" dur="7.38">want to have you know a logical rational</text>
  <text start="123.29" dur="4.63">point to begin like if we were gonna</text>
  <text start="125.49" dur="4.56">actually disprove Q in theory you would</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="4.86">want to see somebody with like a live</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="3.54">stream or you know an unedited video</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="4.83">that</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="7.05">logs in ask you on Patriot&amp;#39;s fight and</text>
  <text start="137.61" dur="4.47">then posts on Patriots fight and admits</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="3.48">that it&amp;#39;s all alar base achill e and</text>
  <text start="142.08" dur="5.04">that that&amp;#39;s at this point that would be</text>
  <text start="144.12" dur="4.979">fairly compelling like you know maybe</text>
  <text start="147.12" dur="3.57">somebody had gotten ahold of that you</text>
  <text start="149.099" dur="3.931">know that access from behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="150.69" dur="3.42">but you know that would be more that</text>
  <text start="153.03" dur="4.01">would be more compelling than what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="154.11" dur="5.34">seeing which is people trying to to just</text>
  <text start="157.04" dur="4.089">take things that are not proof and then</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="2.819">make it like proof to people who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="161.129" dur="2.67">understand the difference or the</text>
  <text start="162.269" dur="4.711">technical side of things like I even saw</text>
  <text start="163.799" dur="5.341">them posting like chat logs and and</text>
  <text start="166.98" dur="3.69">back-end files of some of the archiving</text>
  <text start="169.14" dur="3.06">sites and things like that acting like</text>
  <text start="170.67" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s proof that&amp;#39;s really like a fan</text>
  <text start="172.2" dur="6.539">site you know yeah that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s this is a</text>
  <text start="175.98" dur="4.86">certain people on YouTube and various</text>
  <text start="178.739" dur="4.56">other platforms I don&amp;#39;t know what their</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="6.75">motivation for is for doing this okay I</text>
  <text start="183.299" dur="7.591">won&amp;#39;t speculate but they they they do</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="5.31">these long convoluted videos that are</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="3.989">just confusing and full of like the you</text>
  <text start="192.9" dur="3.119">know like that last one you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="194.879" dur="2.73">referencing is a bunch of technical</text>
  <text start="196.019" dur="3.481">jargon that just there to muddy the</text>
  <text start="197.609" dur="3.811">waters and confuse someone that&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="2.549">know new to H and doesn&amp;#39;t understand how</text>
  <text start="201.42" dur="2.64">it works</text>
  <text start="202.049" dur="3.451">new to the movement doesn&amp;#39;t quite know</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="5.28">who to trust yet that&amp;#39;s their target</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="5.549">right there um so with speculation you</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="3.39">know maybe I&amp;#39;ll speculate just a little</text>
  <text start="211.049" dur="4.891">bit here so we have people who are</text>
  <text start="212.73" dur="6.539">taking hours of their day every day and</text>
  <text start="215.94" dur="7.26">they are taking these hour long videos</text>
  <text start="219.269" dur="6.391">and going through this elaborate you</text>
  <text start="223.2" dur="4.02">know debunking or whatever and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="225.66" dur="3.99">trying to Gaslight people about</text>
  <text start="227.22" dur="5.629">something using deception using this</text>
  <text start="229.65" dur="6.059">sort of MSM tricks and things like that</text>
  <text start="232.849" dur="4.271">you know like when CNN puts a panel of</text>
  <text start="235.709" dur="4.321">Trump supporters and they put their own</text>
  <text start="237.12" dur="4.53">guy I saw that earlier put their own non</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="3.5">Trump supporter who&amp;#39;s like a history of</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="4.26">socialism and anti guns and everything</text>
  <text start="243.53" dur="4.69">and then they try to make it look like</text>
  <text start="245.91" dur="4.56">he used to be a trump supporter and then</text>
  <text start="248.22" dur="3.599">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re trying to debunk Trump</text>
  <text start="250.47" dur="2.91">support and they make it look like his</text>
  <text start="251.819" dur="4.47">supporters are abandoning him things</text>
  <text start="253.38" dur="4.56">like that these kind of like gaslighting</text>
  <text start="256.289" dur="4.5">tricks if you say money the water just</text>
  <text start="257.94" dur="5.46">confuses the whole issue for people and</text>
  <text start="260.789" dur="4.201">I think that you know that level of</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="3.3">deception in that level of effort into</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="2.31">deception like I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="266.7" dur="1.619">for views</text>
  <text start="267.3" dur="3.769">don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re getting some of</text>
  <text start="268.319" dur="5.371">that 20 million or what&amp;#39;s going on but</text>
  <text start="271.069" dur="4.481">you know we thought 160 but some people</text>
  <text start="273.69" dur="4.409">are saying only 20 million of it was</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="5.94">really verified so yeah I still plenty</text>
  <text start="278.099" dur="5.79">to pay off some people yeah I agree 100</text>
  <text start="281.49" dur="4.44">percent you know I I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="283.889" dur="4.68">anyone&amp;#39;s been paid I can&amp;#39;t prove but it</text>
  <text start="285.93" dur="4.56">is a lot of effort to going into</text>
  <text start="288.569" dur="4.081">debunking something I mean if if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="290.49" dur="4.139">if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re truly on the on the</text>
  <text start="292.65" dur="6.06">maggot train right if you&amp;#39;re truly Pro</text>
  <text start="294.629" dur="5.78">trumped and Q is very clearly pro-trump</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="3.829">I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="300.409" dur="4.57">complimentary that the president Trump</text>
  <text start="302.539" dur="3.94">you wouldn&amp;#39;t have a you even if you</text>
  <text start="304.979" dur="3.301">didn&amp;#39;t believe that was real you</text>
  <text start="306.479" dur="2.551">wouldn&amp;#39;t have is this big of a problem</text>
  <text start="308.28" dur="2.58">with it</text>
  <text start="309.03" dur="4.56">right it&amp;#39;s not subverting Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="310.86" dur="5.73">message or his agenda in any way I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="313.59" dur="4.62">feel so I just don&amp;#39;t understand the</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="4.669">hostility that&amp;#39;s where it gets kind of</text>
  <text start="318.21" dur="5.85">suspicious there&amp;#39;s this seriously</text>
  <text start="321.259" dur="5.291">hostility to towards the cube movement</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="5.639">and and it&amp;#39;s the worst from some of</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="4.739">these all media people you know and if I</text>
  <text start="329.699" dur="4.681">just think about it logically and think</text>
  <text start="331.289" dur="5.28">logically if if the establishment wanted</text>
  <text start="334.38" dur="4.23">to debunk you you know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="336.569" dur="3.21">that follow Q or might look the follow Q</text>
  <text start="338.61" dur="4.2">aren&amp;#39;t gonna do it in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="339.779" dur="4.44">media they&amp;#39;re gonna do it on YouTube so</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="3.81">the establishments gotta fight that</text>
  <text start="344.219" dur="3.961">battle on both fronts you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="346.62" dur="4.139">gonna discredit on the mainstream and</text>
  <text start="348.18" dur="5.91">through YouTube so to think that there</text>
  <text start="350.759" dur="5.791">aren&amp;#39;t people out there maybe getting a</text>
  <text start="354.09" dur="4.799">paycheck to do this would I feel almost</text>
  <text start="356.55" dur="4.019">be naive but again I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="358.889" dur="3.27">speculate about anyone individually well</text>
  <text start="360.569" dur="4.44">if they like you&amp;#39;re saying if they only</text>
  <text start="362.159" dur="5.581">entire MSM basically it stands to reason</text>
  <text start="365.009" dur="4.65">that they own some of the the fake alt</text>
  <text start="367.74" dur="5.039">media you know we still have we have</text>
  <text start="369.659" dur="4.951">fakes there as well and we&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="372.779" dur="3.75">in all media you know we&amp;#39;re a lot poorer</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="4.619">so we&amp;#39;re probably a lot cheaper to buy</text>
  <text start="376.529" dur="4.23">off right so you know it stands to</text>
  <text start="379.229" dur="4.5">reason that they could get a high impact</text>
  <text start="380.759" dur="4.71">there where the credibility is and it to</text>
  <text start="383.729" dur="3.93">me like the most telling thing was the</text>
  <text start="385.469" dur="5.82">Unison the coordination like right as</text>
  <text start="387.659" dur="5.04">the censorship hit right as the MSM did</text>
  <text start="391.289" dur="3.78">their full onslaught every one of them</text>
  <text start="392.699" dur="4.08">all the main outlets hitting Q at the</text>
  <text start="395.069" dur="4.71">same time with their same conspiracy</text>
  <text start="396.779" dur="4.35">this and cult that at the same time we</text>
  <text start="399.779" dur="3.45">have people like you know these all</text>
  <text start="401.129" dur="5.01">figures that are that are spending more</text>
  <text start="403.229" dur="4.95">hours a day on cue than they are on real</text>
  <text start="406.139" dur="3.84">Magga issues or debunking you know the</text>
  <text start="408.179" dur="4.53">left or or fake news or anything that</text>
  <text start="409.979" dur="5.04">why are they punching right so hard why</text>
  <text start="412.709" dur="4.53">now why coordinated why is it team</text>
  <text start="415.019" dur="3.65">effort and why don&amp;#39;t they have real</text>
  <text start="417.239" dur="3.9">arguments why are they using these</text>
  <text start="418.669" dur="4.33">sophistication DS tricks of logic and</text>
  <text start="421.139" dur="4.23">gas lighting and muddying the waters and</text>
  <text start="422.999" dur="4.41">just insults you generally speaking like</text>
  <text start="425.369" dur="4.11">I have I was talking about on Twitter I</text>
  <text start="427.409" dur="4.62">have four pictures that I can use like</text>
  <text start="429.479" dur="4.351">just memes like appeal to ridicule is</text>
  <text start="432.029" dur="3.78">one of them that&amp;#39;s like the top one and</text>
  <text start="433.83" dur="4.109">if someone I can debunk almost every</text>
  <text start="435.809" dur="4.89">single anti Hugh ever seen with one of</text>
  <text start="437.939" dur="5.52">these four pictures so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="440.699" dur="5.61">understand I I think it&amp;#39;s the twenty</text>
  <text start="443.459" dur="4.531">pieces of silver a scenario obviously we</text>
  <text start="446.309" dur="3.6">can&amp;#39;t prove that but I do have a theory</text>
  <text start="447.99" dur="3.419">that maybe you know government keeps a</text>
  <text start="449.909" dur="3.12">list of everything if we can get a folio</text>
  <text start="451.409" dur="3.78">and figure out who&amp;#39;s getting paid off by</text>
  <text start="453.029" dur="4.26">that money that&amp;#39;d be interesting I think</text>
  <text start="455.189" dur="4.89">that that may come out in time you know</text>
  <text start="457.289" dur="4.89">I think we&amp;#39;re a little ways away from</text>
  <text start="460.079" dur="5.911">that still but maybe not too far you</text>
  <text start="462.179" dur="8.19">know if if Sarah if Sarah Huckabee</text>
  <text start="465.99" dur="6.239">Sanders got asked about Q I don&amp;#39;t feel</text>
  <text start="470.369" dur="5.25">like it&amp;#39;s too far away before you know</text>
  <text start="472.229" dur="5.94">Trump gets asked about Q as well and at</text>
  <text start="475.619" dur="4.741">that point I feel like he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="478.169" dur="4.56">legitimize it it&amp;#39;s instant fame either</text>
  <text start="480.36" dur="5.069">way for whoever asks right I I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="482.729" dur="4.56">surprised it&amp;#39;s taken this long but I</text>
  <text start="485.429" dur="4.47">mean we can even get into the Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="487.289" dur="4.59">thing I I think the reason maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.899" dur="3.66">the the some of I think that&amp;#39;s taken the</text>
  <text start="491.879" dur="4.26">heat off of the queue thing and I think</text>
  <text start="493.559" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s by design I mean I agree and I</text>
  <text start="496.139" dur="3.75">didn&amp;#39;t even think that at first until</text>
  <text start="497.459" dur="5.16">jordan saylor mentioned it but yeah I</text>
  <text start="499.889" dur="3.87">mean if the impact what is the fruit of</text>
  <text start="502.619" dur="2.491">the tree the fruit of the tree is that</text>
  <text start="503.759" dur="4.44">everyone&amp;#39;s defending him for wars no</text>
  <text start="505.11" dur="4.679">one&amp;#39;s focusing on Q right and and you</text>
  <text start="508.199" dur="4.62">were you were saying something earlier</text>
  <text start="509.789" dur="5.701">you saw in the chance basically you know</text>
  <text start="512.819" dur="5.52">it was it was a breakdown of group a</text>
  <text start="515.49" dur="5.909">being I go through it again for me like</text>
  <text start="518.339" dur="5.971">yeah right back yeah I try to find it</text>
  <text start="521.399" dur="6.06">like yeah it well the gist of it was</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="6.209">basically like group a which would be Q</text>
  <text start="527.459" dur="5.43">spreading truth in Group B which would</text>
  <text start="530.519" dur="3.901">be like Infowars taking all the</text>
  <text start="532.889" dur="2.911">attention but their bow</text>
  <text start="534.42" dur="3.45">being censored I mean we have queue</text>
  <text start="535.8" dur="3.81">people being censored as well yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="537.87" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;re thinking that they&amp;#39;re gonna back</text>
  <text start="539.61" dur="3.419">off of Infowars and then act like</text>
  <text start="541.44" dur="3.78">everything&amp;#39;s okay try to co-op the</text>
  <text start="543.029" dur="4.05">movement and the narrative and then keep</text>
  <text start="545.22" dur="4.2">the censorship on the queue folks at the</text>
  <text start="547.079" dur="5.82">same time try to then just basically</text>
  <text start="549.42" dur="4.859">make it go away yeah I mean anything</text>
  <text start="552.899" dur="3.481">works is over six million new</text>
  <text start="554.279" dur="5.701">subscribers to their newsletter</text>
  <text start="556.38" dur="6.509">since being banned you know so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="559.98" dur="4.2">the idea is to put all the focus on them</text>
  <text start="562.889" dur="3.181">and then tie him in with what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="564.18" dur="3.75">doing you know and being that he&amp;#39;s such</text>
  <text start="566.07" dur="4.65">a big personality and has such a big</text>
  <text start="567.93" dur="5.61">following kind of turned him into the</text>
  <text start="570.72" dur="4.14">new mainstream you know truther so to</text>
  <text start="573.54" dur="3.09">speak if you want to say that and then</text>
  <text start="574.86" dur="3.24">they can kind of push the narrative</text>
  <text start="576.63" dur="3.81">again they can kind of control the</text>
  <text start="578.1" dur="4.47">narrative from the establishment point</text>
  <text start="580.44" dur="4.05">of view and I gotta say I got it this</text>
  <text start="582.57" dur="4.5">this was a really smart move on their</text>
  <text start="584.49" dur="4.62">part because look at it from you know</text>
  <text start="587.07" dur="3.69">our perspective I mean we have been</text>
  <text start="589.11" dur="3.779">fighting so hard against the censorship</text>
  <text start="590.76" dur="4.439">and you know for our free speech on</text>
  <text start="592.889" dur="3.931">these digital platforms so a lot of us</text>
  <text start="595.199" dur="3.95">don&amp;#39;t necessarily agree with Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="596.82" dur="6.15">and you know the way he fear mongers and</text>
  <text start="599.149" dur="5.861">just his overall his lies about Q I mean</text>
  <text start="602.97" dur="5.01">I yeah well that too I mean yeah I mean</text>
  <text start="605.01" dur="6.389">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s discredited himself a great</text>
  <text start="607.98" dur="6.479">deal but still when we see someone gets</text>
  <text start="611.399" dur="4.741">censored and and taken off you know we</text>
  <text start="614.459" dur="4.32">have to stick up and fight for them and</text>
  <text start="616.14" dur="4.949">they know that so they knew that we are</text>
  <text start="618.779" dur="5.37">to divide our energy to defend the First</text>
  <text start="621.089" dur="4.531">Amendment even even if it was someone</text>
  <text start="624.149" dur="3.421">that we don&amp;#39;t necessarily agree with it</text>
  <text start="625.62" dur="3.779">was it was a good chess move a good a</text>
  <text start="627.57" dur="3.209">good strategic move on their part I</text>
  <text start="629.399" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s gonna ultimately make a</text>
  <text start="630.779" dur="5.521">difference I think they have to activate</text>
  <text start="633.209" dur="5.971">every last no one&amp;#39;s buying it yeah that</text>
  <text start="636.3" dur="4.769">they have to activate every last asset</text>
  <text start="639.18" dur="4.469">they have at this point because they are</text>
  <text start="641.069" dur="4.95">on the ropes and hurting badly yeah and</text>
  <text start="643.649" dur="5.041">and my theory here is that this is going</text>
  <text start="646.019" dur="4.021">to purify the alt media movement like</text>
  <text start="648.69" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re gonna know who the shills here are</text>
  <text start="650.04" dur="3.989">as well now and then just like with the</text>
  <text start="652.5" dur="2.94">fake news those people are gonna be part</text>
  <text start="654.029" dur="4.021">of this group that no one ever trusts</text>
  <text start="655.44" dur="4.949">again and that&amp;#39;s just a matter of time I</text>
  <text start="658.05" dur="4.5">mean especially now where we have faster</text>
  <text start="660.389" dur="6.121">and harder or you know evidences than</text>
  <text start="662.55" dur="8.61">ever so you know just queue watch right</text>
  <text start="666.51" dur="6.18">absolutely man so you know this as you</text>
  <text start="671.16" dur="4.41">said it&amp;#39;s kind of a brilliant strategy</text>
  <text start="672.69" dur="4.53">to if they can&amp;#39;t stop the train they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.57" dur="3.81">gonna try to change the conductor and</text>
  <text start="677.22" dur="4.919">that I think with Alex Jones is</text>
  <text start="679.38" dur="4.38">basically what&amp;#39;s going on I mean none of</text>
  <text start="682.139" dur="3.271">these alt media figures want a debate</text>
  <text start="683.76" dur="3.72">I&amp;#39;ve challenged them to it none of them</text>
  <text start="685.41" dur="4.41">want to let me want to respond to me at</text>
  <text start="687.48" dur="3.69">this point because when I when I point</text>
  <text start="689.82" dur="4.379">out how all they&amp;#39;re doing is insulting</text>
  <text start="691.17" dur="5.07">and they don&amp;#39;t have arguments it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="694.199" dur="5.221">it&amp;#39;s real obvious and I feel like people</text>
  <text start="696.24" dur="5.31">can just see that for themselves so at</text>
  <text start="699.42" dur="4.32">this point you know I don&amp;#39;t know what to</text>
  <text start="701.55" dur="4.56">do I try to expose fake news and that</text>
  <text start="703.74" dur="3.87">includes fake alt media news and I do a</text>
  <text start="706.11" dur="4.08">little bit blowback from that from from</text>
  <text start="707.61" dur="4.26">our own side but you know that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="710.19" dur="2.94">what Q told us to do is expose the fake</text>
  <text start="711.87" dur="2.909">news we don&amp;#39;t have to worry about MSM</text>
  <text start="713.13" dur="6.69">anymore or like they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;re dead</text>

  <text start="1148.179" dur="3.841">point but I think I think the obvious is</text>
  <text start="1150.7" dur="3.27">gonna get through the emotions people</text>
  <text start="1152.02" dur="4.11">are gonna have to just realize look yeah</text>

  <text start="1163.33" dur="3.81">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna have to come to that at</text>
  <text start="1165.16" dur="6.54">their own pace you know it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="1167.14" dur="7.74">point and we&amp;#39;ve got a it it&amp;#39;s funny cuz</text>
  <text start="1171.7" dur="4.979">we we oftentimes blame the left for</text>
  <text start="1174.88" dur="5.82">being huge hypocrites and all their</text>
  <text start="1176.679" dur="5.491">logic right yet we expect them to come</text>

  <text start="1182.17" dur="5.25">hussein&amp;#39;s their HRC&amp;#39;s hero but yeah you</text>
  <text start="1185.559" dur="4.441">know we expect them to come to terms</text>
  <text start="1187.42" dur="4.98">with they&amp;#39;re criminals and traitors</text>
  <text start="1190" dur="4.95">but then you know Alex Jones there&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1192.4" dur="5.31">this division amongst us because people</text>
  <text start="1194.95" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t want to give up on that you know</text>
  <text start="1197.71" dur="1.92">they they like them they liked watching</text>
  <text start="1198.88" dur="2.1">they</text>
  <text start="1199.63" dur="4.56">they thought that he was a beacon of</text>
  <text start="1200.98" dur="5.67">light you know but it&amp;#39;s hard it&amp;#39;s hard</text>
  <text start="1204.19" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s hard to like turn that off or</text>
  <text start="1206.65" dur="4.05">realize what he really is or admit to</text>
  <text start="1208.69" dur="5.27">yourself what he really is but if you</text>
  <text start="1210.7" dur="5.82">want if you want the left to you know to</text>
  <text start="1213.96" dur="4.12">admit what their people are you have to</text>
  <text start="1216.52" dur="4.38">be willing to follow the information and</text>
  <text start="1218.08" dur="5.34">the evidence yourself and and you know</text>
  <text start="1220.9" dur="5.1">put your ego aside and admit that you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1223.42" dur="4.17">been misled as well I mean I I was an</text>
  <text start="1226" dur="3.27">info war subscriber I was a daily</text>
  <text start="1227.59" dur="4.2">watcher that was how I got my news for</text>
  <text start="1229.27" dur="4.56">quite a while actually it wasn&amp;#39;t easy</text>
  <text start="1231.79" dur="3.33">for me either but you know it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1233.83" dur="3.48">take me more than a few days after</text>
  <text start="1235.12" dur="4.41">seeing him turn on this movement to</text>
  <text start="1237.31" dur="4.4">realize okay you know he is what he is</text>
  <text start="1239.53" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s time to you know find new sources</text>
  <text start="1241.71" dur="3.7">it&amp;#39;s that simple</text>
  <text start="1243.31" dur="5.01">you know move on and I think that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1245.41" dur="4.59">we you know overall I mean some of us</text>
  <text start="1248.32" dur="2.73">have had become public faces but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1250" dur="3.63">why this had to be an anonymous</text>
  <text start="1251.05" dur="5.12">anonymous movement because it really is</text>
  <text start="1253.63" dur="4.92">about the message not the messenger and</text>
  <text start="1256.17" dur="4.39">people get tied up in the messenger and</text>
  <text start="1258.55" dur="5.28">then you know they attack the messenger</text>
  <text start="1260.56" dur="5.13">or they get invested in the messenger</text>
  <text start="1263.83" dur="4.92">and that is it&amp;#39;s about the argument it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1265.69" dur="6.42">about the words it&amp;#39;s about what is being</text>
  <text start="1268.75" dur="5.64">said and not who is saying it and they</text>
  <text start="1272.11" dur="3.81">have no argument it&amp;#39;s you know it maybe</text>
  <text start="1274.39" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re saying maybe they have the right</text>
  <text start="1275.92" dur="2.16">people saying it but they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="1277.42" dur="3.84">right thing to say</text>
  <text start="1278.08" dur="4.74">so I think it will backfire and I think</text>
  <text start="1281.26" dur="2.94">honestly I think it was a terrible</text>
  <text start="1282.82" dur="4.05">decision on their part because while it</text>
  <text start="1284.2" dur="4.38">may seem like a good 40 move like the</text>
  <text start="1286.87" dur="3.6">timing with everything that&amp;#39;s about to</text>
  <text start="1288.58" dur="3.39">happen with Q&amp;amp;N Trump it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="1290.47" dur="2.37">they&amp;#39;re gonna just sit idly this is</text>
  <text start="1291.97" dur="2.31">they&amp;#39;re gonna turn up the pressure</text>
  <text start="1292.84" dur="2.58">they&amp;#39;re gonna punch back ten times</text>
  <text start="1294.28" dur="5.25">harder and they&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="1295.42" dur="7.02">disclosing even harder did you hear</text>
  <text start="1299.53" dur="4.89">about that 747 and the arc Little Rock</text>
  <text start="1302.44" dur="4.05">Arkansas yeah we were tracking the plane</text>
  <text start="1304.42" dur="3.45">live on on the soapbox while it was in</text>
  <text start="1306.49" dur="3.09">the air we were actually bringing it up</text>
  <text start="1307.87" dur="4.68">on the screen and stuff that&amp;#39;s a message</text>

  <text start="1326.65" dur="4.5">at the cusp I mean we&amp;#39;ve already hit the</text>
  <text start="1328.84" dur="4.47">mainstream I think that was a huge huge</text>
  <text start="1331.15" dur="4.44">point in the you know a huge miles</text>
  <text start="1333.31" dur="3.75">and the movement was to have that the</text>
  <text start="1335.59" dur="3.09">mainstream media go full-on attack</text>
  <text start="1337.06" dur="3.93">because he baits</text>
  <text start="1338.68" dur="7.08">yeah it&amp;#39;s we are too big to be ignored</text>

  <text start="1832.92" dur="7.23">movement man people the the more</text>
  <text start="1837.27" dur="4.62">moderate liberals they still want</text>
  <text start="1840.15" dur="4.14">freedom of speech they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1841.89" dur="5.43">pedophilia you know I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="1844.29" dur="4.68">them would honestly if you ask them</text>
  <text start="1847.32" dur="2.88">would say there&amp;#39;s only two genders you</text>

  <text start="1850.2" dur="4.38">honestly I don&amp;#39;t you know I I just think</text>
  <text start="1852.33" dur="4.2">that there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that would</text>
  <text start="1854.58" dur="3.75">call themselves liberals and at this</text>
  <text start="1856.53" dur="3.66">point what&amp;#39;s keeping them liberal is the</text>
  <text start="1858.33" dur="3.09">media&amp;#39;s like you should hate Trump you</text>
  <text start="1860.19" dur="2.73">should hate Trump you should hate Trump</text>
  <text start="1861.42" dur="5.46">and really the only platform that keeps</text>
  <text start="1862.92" dur="5.61">them liberal is is the hatred of Donald</text>
  <text start="1866.88" dur="3.57">and the emotional stuff you know like</text>
  <text start="1868.53" dur="3.27">maybe is separating kids at the borders</text>
  <text start="1870.45" dur="3.35">they don&amp;#39;t agree with that so they just</text>
  <text start="1871.8" dur="4.11">kind of demonize Trump and which in turn</text>
  <text start="1873.8" dur="5.08">kind of keeps them on that but I think</text>
  <text start="1875.91" dur="4.41">the walk away movement is it&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1878.88" dur="2.94">because you&amp;#39;re seeing that&amp;#39;s outlash</text>
  <text start="1880.32" dur="3.33">against free speech and a lot of</text>
  <text start="1881.82" dur="3.24">moderate liberals have nothing against</text>

  <text start="1922.77" dur="2.94">something wrong with me in school</text>
  <text start="1924.57" dur="3.03">because I didn&amp;#39;t want to pay attention</text>
  <text start="1925.71" dur="4.95">and just none of it felt like it had any</text>
  <text start="1927.6" dur="5.25">value and even through college like C&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1930.66" dur="4.95">get degrees like I I showed up just</text>
  <text start="1932.85" dur="5.31">often enough as I had to to get a 75% in</text>
  <text start="1935.61" dur="5.13">my classes and just move on with my life</text>

  <text start="1942.96" dur="4.05">messed up in the head for some reason</text>
  <text start="1944.79" dur="3.74">because you know I didn&amp;#39;t want to study</text>
  <text start="1947.01" dur="4.98">and I didn&amp;#39;t want to focus on this</text>

  <text start="1951.99" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;ve read and learned since then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1954.27" dur="3.66">like there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with me</text>
  <text start="1955.56" dur="3.84">I just wasn&amp;#39;t as programmable as some of</text>
  <text start="1957.93" dur="3.45">these other people that just are happy</text>

  <text start="1967.77" dur="3.3">nothing wrong with me at all it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2113.36" dur="7.05">the most part I I&amp;#39;m 100% behind pretty</text>
  <text start="2116.75" dur="6">much everything he&amp;#39;s done and I I think</text>
  <text start="2120.41" dur="3.69">that he is going to do all the things</text>
  <text start="2122.75" dur="2.52">that we&amp;#39;ve been desperately waiting for</text>

  <text start="2136.96" dur="4.359">hopefully throughout the world you know</text>
  <text start="2140.15" dur="3.81">and the things that you know what</text>
  <text start="2141.319" dur="4.861">initially got me into supporting a lot</text>
  <text start="2143.96" dur="3.96">of what he was doing was you know</text>
  <text start="2146.18" dur="4.05">lowering taxes lowing regulations things</text>
  <text start="2147.92" dur="4.35">that as a voluntary and less and less</text>
  <text start="2150.23" dur="3.69">government like I got I was originally</text>
  <text start="2152.27" dur="3.779">like a Ron Paul limited government</text>
  <text start="2153.92" dur="3.449">constitutionalist guy and I just wanted</text>
  <text start="2156.049" dur="2.79">a little bit of government as possible</text>
  <text start="2157.369" dur="3.331">like you know you guys basically just</text>
  <text start="2158.839" dur="4.891">need like one guy with a button for the</text>
  <text start="2160.7" dur="5.94">nukes that&amp;#39;s it you know at that point</text>
  <text start="2163.73" dur="6.03">you know I realize Trump is getting us</text>
  <text start="2166.64" dur="5.55">back to you know there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2169.76" dur="3.839">communism collectivism stuff and then I</text>
  <text start="2172.19" dur="4.08">did any politics and then there&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2173.599" dur="4.561">the individual individualist free-market</text>
  <text start="2176.27" dur="3.299">capitalist stuff and it&amp;#39;s a spectrum</text>
  <text start="2178.16" dur="2.82">it&amp;#39;s not on earth on or off you know</text>
  <text start="2179.569" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re mostly down the socialist</text>
  <text start="2180.98" dur="5.579">communist path but he&amp;#39;s pushing us back</text>
  <text start="2183.859" dur="3.99">you know that&amp;#39;s gonna like that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2186.559" dur="2.221">get people more interested in freedom</text>
  <text start="2187.849" dur="3.091">they&amp;#39;re gonna start seeing the benefits</text>
  <text start="2188.78" dur="4.92">of freedom again like it&amp;#39;s gonna let the</text>
  <text start="2190.94" dur="4.109">slaves taste the sunlight and people are</text>
  <text start="2193.7" dur="4.53">gonna peek their head out the Plato&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2195.049" dur="4.56">cave and once that&amp;#39;s once that scene it</text>
  <text start="2198.23" dur="3.089">can be unseen and then people are gonna</text>
  <text start="2199.609" dur="3.631">start to really appreciate things like</text>
  <text start="2201.319" dur="4.141">limited government again and then maybe</text>
  <text start="2203.24" dur="4.349">we can put this thing back in the box my</text>
  <text start="2205.46" dur="3.77">big worry here is that is not that we</text>
  <text start="2207.589" dur="3.96">lose this it&amp;#39;s that we win this thing</text>
  <text start="2209.23" dur="4.3">but and we have this like Good King</text>
  <text start="2211.549" dur="3.931">figure and then we have a bad King as</text>
  <text start="2213.53" dur="3.809">the next one like we don&amp;#39;t want to have</text>
  <text start="2215.48" dur="4.77">this monster and then Trump goes and</text>
  <text start="2217.339" dur="4.74">then we have another another bad guy</text>
  <text start="2220.25" dur="3.48">control this monster and use it against</text>
  <text start="2222.079" dur="4.441">us again like we just want to lower the</text>
  <text start="2223.73" dur="4.349">government but that one I&amp;#39;m still trying</text>
  <text start="2226.52" dur="4.77">to like get out there to people the</text>
  <text start="2228.079" dur="4.53">philosophy and the limited stuff limited</text>
  <text start="2231.29" dur="2.91">government benefits because it&amp;#39;s all the</text>
  <text start="2232.609" dur="3.541">same things that were enshrined in the</text>
  <text start="2234.2" dur="3.75">Constitution natural rights and small</text>
  <text start="2236.15" dur="6.33">government but you know it&amp;#39;s just like</text>
  <text start="2237.95" dur="6.09">1% further and I hear you you know Trump</text>
  <text start="2242.48" dur="3.9">could only be there for eight years</text>
  <text start="2244.04" dur="5.91">total and there&amp;#39;s got to be someone to</text>
  <text start="2246.38" dur="4.919">come after him in there for thousands of</text>
  <text start="2249.95" dur="3.75">years in the background they&amp;#39;ll be there</text>
  <text start="2251.299" dur="4.56">after they&amp;#39;ll be waiting for time yeah</text>
  <text start="2253.7" dur="4.02">well that&amp;#39;s why I hope that the he ends</text>
  <text start="2255.859" dur="3.96">some bloodlines well he&amp;#39;s there you know</text>
  <text start="2257.72" dur="4.74">for the love of God I mean that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2259.819" dur="4.561">honestly if he doesn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s all for</text>
  <text start="2262.46" dur="4.559">naught really it will come back it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2264.38" dur="5.189">gonna sit you know they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="2267.019" dur="4.681">evil evil is relentless and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2269.569" dur="4.621">persistent and if you just if he opened</text>
  <text start="2271.7" dur="4.139">the door I saw I saw a sign outside of a</text>
  <text start="2274.19" dur="4.23">church once years ago that made me laugh</text>
  <text start="2275.839" dur="5.19">it says you give Satan an inch he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2278.42" dur="5.28">become a ruler you know I thought that</text>
  <text start="2281.029" dur="4.5">was a really clever uh pretty much yeah</text>
  <text start="2283.7" dur="4.349">a really clever a little play on words</text>
  <text start="2285.529" dur="4.621">there and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s true you know</text>
  <text start="2288.049" dur="4.861">yeah if you don&amp;#39;t completely remove</text>
  <text start="2290.15" dur="3.81">these people you know won&amp;#39;t take long</text>
  <text start="2292.91" dur="4.77">before they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re manipulating</text>
  <text start="2293.96" dur="5.49">again so I like to use the term like</text>
  <text start="2297.68" dur="3.359">salt the earth and like wipe out every</text>
  <text start="2299.45" dur="4.169">single one of their bloodline yeah</text>
  <text start="2301.039" dur="6.421">illegal you know military tribunal way</text>
  <text start="2303.619" dur="6.511">yeah someone else will rise if they if</text>
  <text start="2307.46" dur="4.95">there is that power structure to abuse</text>
  <text start="2310.13" dur="4.469">someone will become corrupt and abuse</text>
  <text start="2312.41" dur="3.51">that power structure get to that level</text>
  <text start="2314.599" dur="3.151">of power and wealth again when people</text>
  <text start="2315.92" dur="3.96">stop paying attention and then we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2317.75" dur="6.45">have some new blood line it&amp;#39;ll all start</text>
  <text start="2319.88" dur="8.52">over so so I think root of the evil not</text>
  <text start="2324.2" dur="7.74">just the branches well I think the evil</text>
  <text start="2328.4" dur="7.32">was able to take hold because previously</text>
  <text start="2331.94" dur="5.879">you know the the establishment cabal had</text>
  <text start="2335.72" dur="4.2">full control over the flow of</text>
  <text start="2337.819" dur="3.72">information you know it was TV radio and</text>
  <text start="2339.92" dur="3.54">newspaper all three of which have a</text>
  <text start="2341.539" dur="3.211">fairly high barrier for entry for</text>
  <text start="2343.46" dur="3.899">someone like you or I that wanted to</text>
  <text start="2344.75" dur="4.47">preach a different message right so now</text>
  <text start="2347.359" dur="4.41">we have the Internet which threatens all</text>
  <text start="2349.22" dur="5.399">of that big time but that there&amp;#39;s big</text>
  <text start="2351.769" dur="5.07">media outlets are still in place and</text>
  <text start="2354.619" dur="5.22">they still like my parents so I love the</text>
  <text start="2356.839" dur="5.01">death they still watch CNN you know they</text>
  <text start="2359.839" dur="3.541">think MSNBC is more down the middle I</text>
  <text start="2361.849" dur="3.591">mean that&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re in there they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2363.38" dur="4.05">dumb people they&amp;#39;re actually very smart</text>
  <text start="2365.44" dur="3.819">wonderful people it&amp;#39;s just that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2367.43" dur="3.179">what they know and it&amp;#39;s hard to convince</text>
  <text start="2369.259" dur="5.04">them like you and I sitting here with</text>
  <text start="2370.609" dur="6.031">our webcam can be real news you know so</text>
  <text start="2374.299" dur="4.77">but that&amp;#39;s still in place and I think</text>
  <text start="2376.64" dur="5.129">ultimately what what President Trump has</text>
  <text start="2379.069" dur="4.05">been doing is when he said in queue has</text>
  <text start="2381.769" dur="3.32">been doing when he says set the stage</text>
  <text start="2383.119" dur="4.74">what they&amp;#39;re saying is we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="2385.089" dur="4.21">removing this legacy media we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2387.859" dur="3.121">removing the propaganda arm of the</text>
  <text start="2389.299" dur="3.661">government which is going to</text>
  <text start="2390.98" dur="3.96">decentralize the media and return it</text>
  <text start="2392.96" dur="3.869">back to every everyday people like us</text>
  <text start="2394.94" dur="4.679">you know and it&amp;#39;s going to be honest</text>
  <text start="2396.829" dur="3.571">again and I think that&amp;#39;s our best weapon</text>
  <text start="2399.619" dur="3.361">is if we kill</text>
  <text start="2400.4" dur="4.11">the TV media that that expensive media</text>
  <text start="2402.98" dur="4.47">the one that me and you can&amp;#39;t really get</text>
  <text start="2404.51" dur="4.71">to and we get we get the the country and</text>
  <text start="2407.45" dur="3.51">in the population getting their media</text>
  <text start="2409.22" dur="4.109">through online sources of free and open</text>
  <text start="2410.96" dur="4.889">Internet then then we have a chance of</text>
  <text start="2413.329" dur="4.411">keeping people informed and you know</text>
  <text start="2415.849" dur="3.811">being more informed voters and maybe</text>
  <text start="2417.74" dur="4.71">getting somebody through you know to</text>
  <text start="2419.66" dur="5.939">lead us or to represent us that actually</text>
  <text start="2422.45" dur="5.55">represents our needs and we can maybe</text>
  <text start="2425.599" dur="3.871">keep a stranglehold on our freedom the</text>
  <text start="2428" dur="3.089">way they used to keep a stranglehold on</text>
  <text start="2429.47" dur="4.079">information back when they had those</text>
  <text start="2431.089" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s a few avenues of it locked up so</text>
  <text start="2433.549" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s my thought a free flow of</text>
  <text start="2435.079" dur="4.171">information on a free internet would be</text>
  <text start="2437.029" dur="3.691">very difficult to overcome for them to</text>
  <text start="2439.25" dur="3.51">try to do even if they were to go back</text>
  <text start="2440.72" dur="3.809">and set up an entirely controlled like</text>
  <text start="2442.76" dur="3.15">television system again like that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2444.529" dur="3.991">demographic thing they&amp;#39;re dying off</text>
  <text start="2445.91" dur="7.59">right the average viewer for these these</text>
  <text start="2448.52" dur="6.42">stations are like 60 70 plus but you</text>
  <text start="2453.5" dur="4.349">know have you been following any of the</text>
  <text start="2454.94" dur="5.79">crypto stuff I have a small crypto</text>
  <text start="2457.849" dur="4.5">portfolio but I&amp;#39;m not an expert or</text>
  <text start="2460.73" dur="3.99">anything yeah there&amp;#39;s a few projects I</text>
  <text start="2462.349" dur="4.2">like and hold on to you know host even</text>
  <text start="2464.72" dur="3.72">even not from necessarily like the</text>
  <text start="2466.549" dur="3.901">individual like Bitcoin versus aetherium</text>
  <text start="2468.44" dur="4.919">or whatever but right perspective of</text>
  <text start="2470.45" dur="4.829">like crypto decentralized money and what</text>
  <text start="2473.359" dur="4.411">that means to the centralized like</text>
  <text start="2475.279" dur="4.171">system the banking system the system</text>
  <text start="2477.77" dur="3.18">that lets these Congress people go in</text>
  <text start="2479.45" dur="2.94">penniless to come out two years later</text>
  <text start="2480.95" dur="5.46">four years later as billionaires or</text>
  <text start="2482.39" dur="5.699">millionaires that system is it seems to</text>
  <text start="2486.41" dur="3.57">be that there&amp;#39;s nothing that they can do</text>
  <text start="2488.089" dur="4.5">to stop it like we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re right away</text>
  <text start="2489.98" dur="4.53">from these centralized exchanges you</text>
  <text start="2492.589" dur="2.49">know we have unhackable wallets now for</text>
  <text start="2494.51" dur="4.62">Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="2495.079" dur="6.27">thanks to McAfee McAfee and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2499.13" dur="3.899">there&amp;#39;s another exciting one I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2501.349" dur="3.24">talking about lately it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2503.029" dur="3.78">prototype it&amp;#39;s not even out there yet</text>
  <text start="2504.589" dur="3.45">but it&amp;#39;s called Sky coin and you know</text>
  <text start="2506.809" dur="2.31">I&amp;#39;m not paid to say this or anything I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2508.039" dur="3.691">just really excited about it</text>
  <text start="2509.119" dur="3.901">these guys are innovating a new system</text>
  <text start="2511.73" dur="4.17">for a decentralized internet like</text>
  <text start="2513.02" dur="4.2">everyone will be their own ISP well tell</text>
  <text start="2515.9" dur="3.24">it to your neighbors if you want like</text>
  <text start="2517.22" dur="4.26">that eliminates all of the control</text>
  <text start="2519.14" dur="3.75">system like all of the the choke points</text>
  <text start="2521.48" dur="2.4">where they can go in and like cut you</text>
  <text start="2522.89" dur="2.639">off</text>

  <text start="2689.68" dur="4.56">could talk about those but I wanted to</text>
  <text start="2692.23" dur="4.02">talk about just the whole Muller</text>
  <text start="2694.24" dur="5.01">investigation and Rob Rosenstein a</text>
  <text start="2696.25" dur="4.56">little bit because one thing that just</text>
  <text start="2699.25" dur="4.29">kind of came out organically when I was</text>
  <text start="2700.81" dur="5.16">talking to Brendan dilly was you know</text>
  <text start="2703.54" dur="6.39">what we what are these guys just actors</text>
  <text start="2705.97" dur="6.39">playing their part or you know are they</text>
  <text start="2709.93" dur="4.56">are they really trying to impeach or get</text>
  <text start="2712.36" dur="3.87">rid of Donald Trump you know what what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2714.49" dur="3.39">what what are what role are they playing</text>
  <text start="2716.23" dur="4.86">because there&amp;#39;s definitely seems to be</text>
  <text start="2717.88" dur="5.46">some political theater and what I found</text>
  <text start="2721.09" dur="5.43">interesting or we found interesting was</text>
  <text start="2723.34" dur="5.82">when you look at the confirmation votes</text>
  <text start="2726.52" dur="5.13">you know Robert Muller barely passed the</text>
  <text start="2729.16" dur="3.81">Senate confirmation so there&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="2731.65" dur="3.3">there&amp;#39;s plenty of people in the Senate</text>
  <text start="2732.97" dur="6.09">for whatever reason that are very afraid</text>
  <text start="2734.95" dur="5.79">of robert muller now rod Rosenstein was</text>
  <text start="2739.06" dur="5.99">a different story his confirmation vote</text>
  <text start="2740.74" dur="6.9">was 94 to 6 for him so almost everybody</text>
  <text start="2745.05" dur="9.01">supported his appointment but you know</text>
  <text start="2747.64" dur="8.79">who didn&amp;#39;t John McCain which yeah I</text>
  <text start="2754.06" dur="4.95">don&amp;#39;t know what he&amp;#39;s doing but the but</text>
  <text start="2756.43" dur="5.01">the point is if John McCain is tied to</text>
  <text start="2759.01" dur="6.45">the very top of Spygate and this whole</text>
  <text start="2761.44" dur="6.81">this whole Russia collusion delusion</text>
  <text start="2765.46" dur="6.27">narrative he has a big role of that and</text>
  <text start="2768.25" dur="5.55">if he&amp;#39;s one of the six senators that</text>
  <text start="2771.73" dur="3.99">didn&amp;#39;t vote I don&amp;#39;t think he voted</text>
  <text start="2773.8" dur="4.14">against but he didn&amp;#39;t vote for Rod</text>
  <text start="2775.72" dur="5.1">Rosenstein I think that&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="2777.94" dur="4.8">telling because if anyone knows what</text>
  <text start="2780.82" dur="4.26">Rosenstein might really be doing or what</text>
  <text start="2782.74" dur="3.57">his real role might be I think John</text>
  <text start="2785.08" dur="3.12">McCain might and if you look at the</text>
  <text start="2786.31" dur="3.87">other senators that didn&amp;#39;t vote they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2788.2" dur="3.54">all Democrats or didn&amp;#39;t vote for or</text>
  <text start="2790.18" dur="3.12">voted against they&amp;#39;re all Democrats</text>
  <text start="2791.74" dur="3.99">I think Menendez was one and that one</text>
  <text start="2793.3" dur="4.47">said Cory Booker was another but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2795.73" dur="4.59">all people that you would assume have</text>
  <text start="2797.77" dur="5.16">some skeletons in their closet so</text>
  <text start="2800.32" dur="4.5">when you look at it from that angle it</text>
  <text start="2802.93" dur="4.44">almost seems to me that rod Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="2804.82" dur="4.62">is playing a part for president for</text>
  <text start="2807.37" dur="4.38">president Trump and and running a</text>
  <text start="2809.44" dur="4.65">smokescreen you know yeah I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2811.75" dur="4.02">pretty much against Bueller and Rosen</text>
  <text start="2814.09" dur="3.81">scene and I&amp;#39;m not even a big fan of</text>
  <text start="2815.77" dur="3.72">sessions to be honest but Mueller and</text>
  <text start="2817.9" dur="3.18">Rosen scene were corrupt and crooked and</text>
  <text start="2819.49" dur="5.28">we know that and I don&amp;#39;t trust anyone</text>
  <text start="2821.08" dur="7.29">who ever was but if the theory that they</text>
  <text start="2824.77" dur="5.31">are you know kind of taken you know</text>
  <text start="2828.37" dur="3.42">taken in our side now or they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2830.08" dur="3.6">forced to do so</text>
  <text start="2831.79" dur="5.73">it does explain some of the stuff Rosen</text>
  <text start="2833.68" dur="5.91">Cena&amp;#39;s done so he seems to have you know</text>
  <text start="2837.52" dur="3.81">done the right thing at certain points</text>
  <text start="2839.59" dur="3.21">and maybe someone has that delaying he</text>
  <text start="2841.33" dur="2.67">was doing was helping Hugh Burrell you</text>
  <text start="2842.8" dur="4.44">know with this investigation I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2844" dur="4.47">know but it is it is very interesting</text>
  <text start="2847.24" dur="3.21">and I&amp;#39;m very interested to see how it</text>
  <text start="2848.47" dur="3.87">unfolds for sure do you know anything</text>
  <text start="2850.45" dur="4.44">else about it though I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2852.34" dur="3.99">anything else about it other than just</text>
  <text start="2854.89" dur="3.69">look at what&amp;#39;s happened since that</text>
  <text start="2856.33" dur="4.52">investigation has started is it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="2858.58" dur="4.95">nothing but a clearing out of the</text>
  <text start="2860.85" dur="4.3">Justice Department the FBI and the State</text>
  <text start="2863.53" dur="4.14">Department has just been getting gutted</text>
  <text start="2865.15" dur="5.58">ever since that investigation started</text>
  <text start="2867.67" dur="6.09">the other thing I would say is it came</text>
  <text start="2870.73" dur="5.22">out that President Trump had asked rod</text>
  <text start="2873.76" dur="5.58">Rosenstein to make do that press</text>
  <text start="2875.95" dur="5.25">conference about the 12 indictments of</text>
  <text start="2879.34" dur="4.59">the Russian hackers or whatever right</text>
  <text start="2881.2" dur="5.19">before Trump&amp;#39;s meeting with Putin so he</text>
  <text start="2883.93" dur="5.07">could gain leverage on Putin in their</text>
  <text start="2886.39" dur="4.41">talks and negotiation now first of all</text>
  <text start="2889" dur="3.81">if he was in Putin&amp;#39;s pocket he wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2890.8" dur="3.12">be making moves like that you know</text>
  <text start="2892.81" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s not something you do when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2893.92" dur="4.89">a puppet second of all and I&amp;#39;ll use</text>
  <text start="2896.65" dur="5.64">dillies words exactly to have that level</text>
  <text start="2898.81" dur="5.43">of obedience for the President to go out</text>
  <text start="2902.29" dur="4.02">there and do that on his at his wishes</text>
  <text start="2904.24" dur="4.35">shows me that this isn&amp;#39;t a guy working</text>
  <text start="2906.31" dur="4.26">against the president now for your point</text>
  <text start="2908.59" dur="5.4">I think that these guys both are had a</text>
  <text start="2910.57" dur="7.44">lot of corruption in their past but you</text>
  <text start="2913.99" dur="6.39">need some people to turn and and work</text>
  <text start="2918.01" dur="4.08">with you from over there so you know</text>
  <text start="2920.38" dur="3.06">that Muller met with Trump the day</text>
  <text start="2922.09" dur="3.66">before he was appointed a special</text>
  <text start="2923.44" dur="4.59">counsel I think you know I&amp;#39;m really</text>
  <text start="2925.75" dur="3.99">starting to believe it took me a while</text>
  <text start="2928.03" dur="3.3">to get to this point that President</text>
  <text start="2929.74" dur="4.47">Trump laid out everything they had on</text>
  <text start="2931.33" dur="6.779">him and said look you could play ball</text>
  <text start="2934.21" dur="6.81">and all this goes away or we do it the</text>
  <text start="2938.109" dur="4.951">hard way and I think I think Muller is</text>
  <text start="2941.02" dur="4.65">just doing a job right now the job that</text>
  <text start="2943.06" dur="4.289">he was hired to do I think probably so</text>
  <text start="2945.67" dur="3.06">him do the investigation down the middle</text>
  <text start="2947.349" dur="2.941">if he knows they&amp;#39;re not going to find</text>
  <text start="2948.73" dur="2.369">anything on him and when they look at</text>
  <text start="2950.29" dur="3.72">the other side</text>
  <text start="2951.099" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re gonna find plenty same with</text>
  <text start="2954.01" dur="3.599">Rosenstein I really think that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2956.619" dur="3.391">really starting think that these guys</text>
  <text start="2957.609" dur="4.021">are just buying time for uber there</text>
  <text start="2960.01" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re a shiny object for the</text>
  <text start="2961.63" dur="3.81">mainstream media the chase around I mean</text>
  <text start="2964.06" dur="3.93">think about how many times these</text>
  <text start="2965.44" dur="5.1">mainstream media outlets have Marussia</text>
  <text start="2967.99" dur="3.69">of my Russian Marussia you know when it</text>
  <text start="2970.54" dur="3.89">all comes out that there was nothing</text>
  <text start="2971.68" dur="5.73">there that whole thing was just a</text>
  <text start="2974.43" dur="5.71">Democrat a DNC you know hack job</text>
  <text start="2977.41" dur="4.8">basically trying to frame the president</text>
  <text start="2980.14" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s gonna kill the mainstream media&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2982.21" dur="2.52">credibility if we&amp;#39;re lying about it for</text>
  <text start="2984.28" dur="2.91">so long</text>
  <text start="2984.73" dur="3.99">and it&amp;#39;s gonna destroy the Democrats I</text>
  <text start="2987.19" dur="3.12">think the Democratic Party is done I</text>
  <text start="2988.72" dur="3.48">think is the last election where there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2990.31" dur="3.99">a Democratic Party I really believe that</text>
  <text start="2992.2" dur="3.389">God willing the two-party system I mean</text>
  <text start="2994.3" dur="2.94">that&amp;#39;s happened you know that&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="2995.589" dur="3.361">happening in Europe as well like in some</text>
  <text start="2997.24" dur="4.23">places they don&amp;#39;t even they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="2998.95" dur="6.18">barely able to say Valley well how do</text>
  <text start="3001.47" dur="4.95">you think that all of this like how does</text>
  <text start="3005.13" dur="3">this go into the no deals</text>
  <text start="3006.42" dur="3.75">like he was said no deals many times</text>
  <text start="3008.13" dur="4.2">like this this would mean he&amp;#39;s given</text>
  <text start="3010.17" dur="4.98">roses seen a mule or some kind of deal</text>
  <text start="3012.33" dur="5.13">so is is that disinformation is</text>
  <text start="3015.15" dur="5.07">necessary or what&amp;#39;s up there because</text>
  <text start="3017.46" dur="6.48">that&amp;#39;s what I can never reconcile it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3020.22" dur="6.21">that&amp;#39;s tough I think the the key players</text>
  <text start="3023.94" dur="5.28">like Muller and Rosenstein yes they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3026.43" dur="5.55">been corrupt in the past but were they</text>
  <text start="3029.22" dur="5.19">were they orchestrating or they lackeys</text>
  <text start="3031.98" dur="4.109">you know you can you can you can give a</text>
  <text start="3034.41" dur="4.23">few lackeys a deal what if it means</text>
  <text start="3036.089" dur="4.591">getting the big dogs I think anyone that</text>
  <text start="3038.64" dur="4.89">was orchestrating and given orders and</text>
  <text start="3040.68" dur="5.01">and really conducting this all this</text>
  <text start="3043.53" dur="5.069">nonsense in the background I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="3045.69" dur="7.14">they&amp;#39;re gonna see any mercy but I do</text>
  <text start="3048.599" dur="5.851">think that some of I mean you saw there</text>
  <text start="3052.83" dur="3.06">that they talked about cutting the</text>
  <text start="3054.45" dur="3.54">strings you know he talks about cutting</text>
  <text start="3055.89" dur="3.57">the strings and they talked about at the</text>
  <text start="3057.99" dur="4.5">the State of the Union</text>
  <text start="3059.46" dur="5.159">those those chanting USA had been freed</text>
  <text start="3062.49" dur="3.49">of their blackmail and whatever else</text>
  <text start="3064.619" dur="3.521">that well that was that they had</text>
  <text start="3065.98" dur="5.46">for them I think there&amp;#39;s a number of</text>
  <text start="3068.14" dur="4.77">people that were forced to do things</text>
  <text start="3071.44" dur="2.94">were put in a tough spot might have had</text>
  <text start="3072.91" dur="2.94">good intentions coming into their</text>
  <text start="3074.38" dur="3.9">positions and just got kind of</text>
  <text start="3075.85" dur="6.6">compromised one way or another and I</text>
  <text start="3078.28" dur="7.11">think those people are you know they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3082.45" dur="5.01">had their strings cut and can now act</text>
  <text start="3085.39" dur="3.87">more freely and make better decisions I</text>
  <text start="3087.46" dur="4.17">think those people will maybe get a</text>
  <text start="3089.26" dur="4.44">little bit less you know they maybe all</text>
  <text start="3091.63" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;ll just disappear quietly over time</text>
  <text start="3093.7" dur="4.71">I make sites but I think that I think</text>
  <text start="3096.88" dur="3.42">the big names they&amp;#39;re gonna they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3098.41" dur="5.61">gonna get the full book thrown at them</text>
  <text start="3100.3" dur="5.55">and it&amp;#39;ll be very public and you know I</text>
  <text start="3104.02" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t know when I know it&amp;#39;ll be after</text>
  <text start="3105.85" dur="4.14">January because that&amp;#39;s when I that&amp;#39;s me</text>
  <text start="3108.28" dur="4.56">yeah I have a theory about this actually</text>
  <text start="3109.99" dur="4.41">because it logically speaking like if</text>
  <text start="3112.84" dur="2.7">they if he does a bunch of mass arrests</text>
  <text start="3114.4" dur="2.969">right before midterms they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="3115.54" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re gonna call Civil War tyranny</text>
  <text start="3117.369" dur="3.571">mm-hmm all of these arrests you have to</text>
  <text start="3119.44" dur="2.97">have in after midterms probably</text>
  <text start="3120.94" dur="5.21">immediately after I suspect we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="3122.41" dur="6.66">see arrests I would almost bet on it but</text>
  <text start="3126.15" dur="3.91">there&amp;#39;s a so many unprecedent of people</text>
  <text start="3129.07" dur="4.049">that are saying I&amp;#39;m gonna run for</text>
  <text start="3130.06" dur="4.559">president in 2020 those people are doing</text>
  <text start="3133.119" dur="3.211">that stat of prison and I think that</text>
  <text start="3134.619" dur="3.24">they will have to be arrested after 2020</text>
  <text start="3136.33" dur="2.46">for the same reason because they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="3137.859" dur="4.231">gonna be like he&amp;#39;s arresting his</text>
  <text start="3138.79" dur="5.91">opposition on medicine and that excuse</text>
  <text start="3142.09" dur="5.01">will disappear after 2020 that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3144.7" dur="4.05">interesting well I know that the</text>
  <text start="3147.1" dur="4.41">executive order that allows him to</text>
  <text start="3148.75" dur="6.9">prosecute through military tribunal</text>
  <text start="3151.51" dur="9.53">doesn&amp;#39;t go into effect until the January</text>
  <text start="3155.65" dur="7.68">1st of 2019 yeah so I so I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="3161.04" dur="4.18">while we might see arrests I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="3163.33" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;re gonna see any I don&amp;#39;t think we</text>
  <text start="3165.22" dur="3.899">receive like that the trials until after</text>
  <text start="3167.68" dur="2.81">the new year I think it&amp;#39;s good easily</text>
  <text start="3169.119" dur="3.451">anyway especially when there&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="3170.49" dur="6.04">45,000 indictments I mean it could take</text>
  <text start="3172.57" dur="5.22">years to process yeah so but so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3176.53" dur="4.62">know when we&amp;#39;re gonna see the public</text>
  <text start="3177.79" dur="5.37">arrest the perp walks I the only thing</text>
  <text start="3181.15" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;ll say is I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m I was positive</text>
  <text start="3183.16" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re gonna happen during his first</text>
  <text start="3185.05" dur="3.059">term so I think a lot of people will see</text>
  <text start="3186.64" dur="4.229">his first term as a failure if he</text>
  <text start="3188.109" dur="4.561">doesn&amp;#39;t at least get a few maybe not the</text>

  <text start="3216.109" dur="3.571">barely made the mainstream media you</text>
  <text start="3218.539" dur="2.93">know they made it sound like we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="3219.68" dur="4.5">wake up and in the news there&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="3221.469" dur="6.3">you know mainstream ate their headlines</text>

  <text start="3243.009" dur="4.151">Argentine thing was interesting yeah</text>
  <text start="3245.39" dur="3.839">well this was after that even this was</text>
  <text start="3247.16" dur="5.069">another another drop and and basically</text>
  <text start="3249.229" dur="4.29">the the big thing that we saw and I did</text>
  <text start="3252.229" dur="2.88">not go through this thoroughly so I</text>
  <text start="3253.519" dur="3.381">could be missing something but the big</text>
  <text start="3255.109" dur="3.69">thing that we saw was the coroner report</text>
  <text start="3256.9" dur="3.79">pretty much said that there was two</text>
  <text start="3258.799" dur="3.42">shooters like when you write read the</text>
  <text start="3260.69" dur="4.309">report it pretty much confirms that</text>
  <text start="3262.219" dur="5.37">there could not have been one shooter so</text>
  <text start="3264.999" dur="4.48">at the bunks at the bunks the the</text>
  <text start="3267.589" dur="3.69">mainstream narrative but it didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="3269.479" dur="3.6">any press you know it&amp;#39;s not like and</text>
  <text start="3271.279" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s getting to the point with</text>
  <text start="3273.079" dur="5.28">JFK that the people that that really</text>
  <text start="3275.989" dur="3.931">liked that hit them hard they&amp;#39;re getting</text>

  <text start="3282.199" dur="4.77">interested to see some 9/11 truth rather</text>
  <text start="3284.749" dur="3.78">than you know sense that would be a big</text>
  <text start="3286.969" dur="4.65">one right there especially for the</text>
  <text start="3288.529" dur="4.92">people who are who are still watching</text>
  <text start="3291.619" dur="5.61">the MSM the older generation and stuff</text>
  <text start="3293.449" dur="5.85">you know I almost think that one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3297.229" dur="3.78">almost past its prime in terms of like</text>
  <text start="3299.299" dur="4.5">the Millennials and the younger because</text>
  <text start="3301.009" dur="4.47">they may not even care about 9/11 as</text>

  <text start="3305.479" dur="4.23">where I was when 9/11 happened but you</text>
  <text start="3308.18" dur="3.599">know I was in high school like freshman</text>
  <text start="3309.709" dur="5.58">year or something like that I see the</text>
  <text start="3311.779" dur="4.92">same age as I am yeah oh yeah because I</text>
  <text start="3315.289" dur="3.06">was if I was I was literally sitting my</text>

  <text start="3326.749" dur="4.471">after like the first one hit all yeah</text>
  <text start="3329.42" dur="5.22">there was a crazy day</text>
  <text start="3331.22" dur="5.01">it IRA but that&amp;#39;s what kind of started</text>
  <text start="3334.64" dur="3.66">to wake me up was I saw a loose change I</text>
  <text start="3336.23" dur="3.57">think my senior year of high school or</text>
  <text start="3338.3" dur="3.27">maybe my freshman year of college and</text>
  <text start="3339.8" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s when I just completely like well</text>
  <text start="3341.57" dur="3.96">no point in voting or getting involved</text>
  <text start="3344.21" dur="3.27">in the government because this is just</text>
  <text start="3345.53" dur="5.49">and I just kind of turned off from it</text>
  <text start="3347.48" dur="5.34">for a long time but man yeah that would</text>
  <text start="3351.02" dur="3.06">be great to see some 9/11 truth oh I</text>
  <text start="3352.82" dur="3">would love that some closure on that</text>
  <text start="3354.08" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s a lot of unanswered questions I</text>
  <text start="3355.82" dur="4.95">will I will say this basically like this</text>
  <text start="3359" dur="3.18">cue and I&amp;#39;m thing is basically like</text>
  <text start="3360.77" dur="6.57">caffeine it&amp;#39;s gonna get people Pumped</text>
  <text start="3362.18" dur="7.919">until it stops working and you know we</text>
  <text start="3367.34" dur="4.41">have a couple years and there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="3370.099" dur="3.75">lot of good things but we haven&amp;#39;t had a</text>
  <text start="3371.75" dur="5.369">lot of hardcore concrete things it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3373.849" dur="6.481">been mostly rah-rah and and illusion you</text>
  <text start="3377.119" dur="6.75">know or illusion you know but we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="3380.33" dur="5.22">and and I fairly predict you know I</text>
  <text start="3383.869" dur="4.23">think that logically speaking we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3385.55" dur="7.38">gonna have some kind of arrests by</text>
  <text start="3388.099" dur="7.441">year&amp;#39;s end or or beginning before 2020</text>
  <text start="3392.93" dur="4.919">at least for sure yeah I completely</text>
  <text start="3395.54" dur="4.079">agree with you there now and and even</text>
  <text start="3397.849" dur="3">even if we don&amp;#39;t have a rest this year</text>
  <text start="3399.619" dur="4.23">or early next year we will have</text>
  <text start="3400.849" dur="4.591">something that will have us waiting for</text>
  <text start="3403.849" dur="3.211">them again a little bit longer if this</text>
  <text start="3405.44" dur="3.75">will have some kind of new breakthrough</text>
  <text start="3407.06" dur="3.779">or or they will be you know they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="3409.19" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;ll be getting tried in the public</text>
  <text start="3410.839" dur="4.561">opinion you know it&amp;#39;ll switch from Trump</text>
  <text start="3412.79" dur="3.87">Russia to all of the people that were</text>
  <text start="3415.4" dur="3">involved in this will then be getting</text>
  <text start="3416.66" dur="3.209">hunted that they will no longer be safe</text>
  <text start="3418.4" dur="4.86">to walk in the streets kind of thing you</text>
  <text start="3419.869" dur="6.061">know so I would say keep it out in the</text>
  <text start="3423.26" dur="4.89">mainstream media when you see that can</text>
  <text start="3425.93" dur="4.05">flake completely dead that&amp;#39;s when you</text>
  <text start="3428.15" dur="4.05">can expect the arrests because I think</text>
  <text start="3429.98" dur="4.5">the whole what they&amp;#39;re doing now is just</text>
  <text start="3432.2" dur="4.139">trying to kill the propaganda arm kill</text>
  <text start="3434.48" dur="3.21">the mainstream media so that when they</text>
  <text start="3436.339" dur="5.25">go for the arrest they don&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="3437.69" dur="6.48">this huge machine trying to raise public</text>
  <text start="3441.589" dur="4.741">outcry I think the whole this whole part</text>
  <text start="3444.17" dur="4.35">of the plan that we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="3446.33" dur="4.38">has just been the slow destruction of</text>
  <text start="3448.52" dur="3.78">the mainstream media once that&amp;#39;s out of</text>
  <text start="3450.71" dur="3.72">the way they can do what they want</text>
  <text start="3452.3" dur="5.069">without people without the spin you know</text>
  <text start="3454.43" dur="6.48">and people can be forced to kind of look</text>
  <text start="3457.369" dur="7.301">for their information elsewhere and I</text>
  <text start="3460.91" dur="6.65">think that this whole Spygate this whole</text>
  <text start="3464.67" dur="6.58">the ending the Muller investigation</text>
  <text start="3467.56" dur="6.11">exposing it for what it really was you</text>
  <text start="3471.25" dur="4.62">know and just exposing the trees and I</text>
  <text start="3473.67" dur="4.18">think that&amp;#39;s gonna that&amp;#39;s gonna be the</text>
  <text start="3475.87" dur="4.68">first big nail in the MSM coffin and</text>
  <text start="3477.85" dur="4.8">then from there they can go into you</text>
  <text start="3480.55" dur="3.3">know maybe some of the satanic ritual</text>
  <text start="3482.65" dur="3.24">abuse or something that&amp;#39;s really gonna</text>
  <text start="3483.85" dur="4.44">strike a chord with people I hope that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3485.89" dur="7.35">not part of the sixty hidden 60% hidden</text>
  <text start="3488.29" dur="7.47">it can&amp;#39;t be it can&amp;#39;t be it&amp;#39;s the way I</text>
  <text start="3493.24" dur="3.87">see it like likely would be what&amp;#39;s worse</text>
  <text start="3495.76" dur="2.64">than that I mean I understand like</text>
  <text start="3497.11" dur="2.97">foreign leaders being involved could</text>
  <text start="3498.4" dur="4.59">start wars that kind of thing but other</text>
  <text start="3500.08" dur="6.21">than that that could lead to war like</text>
  <text start="3502.99" dur="4.77">the Satanism stuff and the child torture</text>
  <text start="3506.29" dur="3">and rape and murder stuff and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3507.76" dur="4.74">seeing a lot of pedophilia stuff come</text>
  <text start="3509.29" dur="5.1">out how do they have it what else is</text>
  <text start="3512.5" dur="4.05">that sixty percent right how bad is the</text>

  <text start="3516.55" dur="5.64">including the SRA stuff and the forty</text>
  <text start="3518.65" dur="6.45">you have to write and here&amp;#39;s why I say</text>
  <text start="3522.19" dur="4.8">that is I I&amp;#39;m not like religious or</text>
  <text start="3525.1" dur="6.6">anything like that but I do believe in</text>
  <text start="3526.99" dur="6.45">karma I do believe in like you like what</text>
  <text start="3531.7" dur="4.8">you put out there is what comes back to</text>
  <text start="3533.44" dur="4.59">you and they say you know they say that</text>
  <text start="3536.5" dur="3.63">the public it&amp;#39;s gonna be hard on the</text>
  <text start="3538.03" dur="3.36">public to put that stuff out there maybe</text>
  <text start="3540.13" dur="4.59">we shouldn&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s maybe that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3541.39" dur="5.85">debate look we&amp;#39;ve allowed ourselves to</text>
  <text start="3544.72" dur="5.46">go to sleep and not us like you and I</text>
  <text start="3547.24" dur="5.67">are people watching but but the maple</text>
  <text start="3550.18" dur="5.73">the point is is the public has largely</text>
  <text start="3552.91" dur="5.88">consented to this satanic ritual abuse</text>
  <text start="3555.91" dur="5.07">by not questioning their news by not</text>

  <text start="3738.89" dur="5.25">harshly to the point where well people</text>
  <text start="3741.86" dur="3.96">yeah the example needs to be made and I</text>
  <text start="3744.14" dur="3.48">don&amp;#39;t take any pleasure in that being</text>
  <text start="3745.82" dur="3.81">the case I just think that&amp;#39;s the reality</text>
  <text start="3747.62" dur="4.17">we live in is it needs to be so bad that</text>
  <text start="3749.63" dur="4.05">they talk about it for a thousand years</text>
  <text start="3751.79" dur="3.93">exactly otherwise where&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="3753.68" dur="4.02">disincentive I mean crime that crime</text>
  <text start="3755.72" dur="3.87">that pays is crime that stays and if you</text>
  <text start="3757.7" dur="3.42">have nothing to be afraid of there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="3759.59" dur="2.49">punishment for you then you&amp;#39;re just</text>
