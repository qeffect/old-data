  <text start="53.72" dur="3.18">emotions calm where we write each week</text>
  <text start="55.55" dur="3.12">or least try to write each week about</text>
  <text start="56.9" dur="4.14">the things we feel matter the most to</text>
  <text start="58.67" dur="4.62">our investors and traders last week we</text>
  <text start="61.04" dur="4.229">wrote about the MV equals PQ is it</text>
  <text start="63.29" dur="3.3">really this simple basically trying to</text>
  <text start="65.269" dur="2.821">break down the Federal Reserve and the</text>
  <text start="66.59" dur="3.63">global central banks are trying to do</text>
  <text start="68.09" dur="3.78">with their quantitative easing monetary</text>
  <text start="70.22" dur="3.93">negative interest rate environment and</text>
  <text start="71.87" dur="4.05">this equation although it scares a lot</text>
  <text start="74.15" dur="3.87">of people is really pretty</text>
  <text start="75.92" dur="3.87">straightforward the M is for the money</text>
  <text start="78.02" dur="4.47">supply which is our money based money</text>
  <text start="79.79" dur="5.82">supply in the economy V is the velocity</text>
  <text start="82.49" dur="6.419">of the circulation of the money i dot e</text>
  <text start="85.61" dur="5.67">how much $1 changes hands at a given</text>
  <text start="88.909" dur="4.231">point in time he is the price level in</text>
  <text start="91.28" dur="4.65">the economy and Q is the output produced</text>
  <text start="93.14" dur="5.88">by the economy or GDP so we put this</text>
  <text start="95.93" dur="4.71">chart out last week and basically this</text>
  <text start="99.02" dur="3.18">is the velocity of money for central</text>
  <text start="100.64" dur="3.84">bank assets so you can see here the</text>
  <text start="102.2" dur="4.53">white line is the velocity of money it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="104.48" dur="4.88">been declining for close to two decades</text>
  <text start="106.73" dur="2.63">here now</text>
  <text start="110.25" dur="6.03">from 220 to 1.4 or and then here we call</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="3.63">this the singularity movement where the</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="3.96">central bank Federal Reserve assets on</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="4.05">their balance sheet surpass this</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="5.489">philosophy of money and it&amp;#39;s now dipped</text>
  <text start="122.4" dur="5.73">a little bit over here dip down a little</text>
  <text start="125.729" dur="4.441">bit this isn&amp;#39;t just the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="128.13" dur="6.6">by the way this is the global central</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="7.41">banks the Federal Reserve the ECB PBOC</text>
  <text start="134.73" dur="4.38">and the Bank of Japan so this is all of</text>
  <text start="137.58" dur="3.03">them combined so they&amp;#39;re all doing the</text>
  <text start="139.11" dur="3.54">same thing in a coordinated unified</text>
  <text start="140.61" dur="4.349">fashion you see this little dip here and</text>
  <text start="142.65" dur="4.02">you can see that the Federal Reserve had</text>
  <text start="144.959" dur="2.671">to stop their interest rate hikes and</text>
  <text start="146.67" dur="2.91">now we&amp;#39;re going to go back to</text>
  <text start="147.63" dur="3.78">quantitative easing buying bonds and</text>
  <text start="149.58" dur="4.35">putting assets on their balance sheets</text>
  <text start="151.41" dur="4.44">and giving money out to the investment</text>
  <text start="153.93" dur="3.84">banks in the global corporations which</text>
  <text start="155.85" dur="3.59">just recycle the money back into buying</text>
  <text start="157.77" dur="4.23">back their shares which is why the</text>
  <text start="159.44" dur="4.87">equity markets basically never go down</text>
  <text start="162" dur="3.72">because they&amp;#39;re being subsidized so we</text>
  <text start="164.31" dur="3.09">wrote here negative rates will lead to</text>
  <text start="165.72" dur="3.78">massive central bank asset expansion</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="2.58">then the Minsky moment brings the house</text>
  <text start="169.5" dur="2.58">down</text>
  <text start="169.98" dur="3.66">so basically Hyman Minsky talked about</text>
  <text start="172.08" dur="2.79">debt cycles and how on deck gets out of</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="2.79">hand and out of control it becomes</text>
  <text start="174.87" dur="3.03">almost like a Ponzi finance and you</text>
  <text start="176.43" dur="3.39">can&amp;#39;t pay off the debt any longer and</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="3.54">then everything collapses so this is</text>
  <text start="179.82" dur="2.94">where we&amp;#39;re going here the quantity vdz</text>
  <text start="181.44" dur="2.94">will raise the assets of the balance</text>
  <text start="182.76" dur="3.63">sheet up even higher than 21 trillion</text>
  <text start="184.38" dur="5.3">and the velocity of money will continue</text>
  <text start="186.39" dur="5.129">to drag slower interact lower then</text>
  <text start="189.68" dur="4.029">inflation will be nowhere to be found</text>
  <text start="191.519" dur="4.771">because as we see from Bank of Japan</text>
  <text start="193.709" dur="3.991">who&amp;#39;s had negative or zero rates four to</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="4.199">two over two decades now and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.7" dur="4.289">zero and very low inflation in Japan so</text>
  <text start="200.489" dur="3.361">that&amp;#39;s our proxy that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="201.989" dur="3.871">going shouldn&amp;#39;t catch anyone by surprise</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="4.38">so that&amp;#39;s what we wrote about last week</text>
  <text start="205.86" dur="4.32">so check us out there a little bit</text>
  <text start="208.23" dur="4.14">background on me if you want back here</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="6">underneath and you go and read more</text>
  <text start="212.37" dur="6.06">there about my background and most of my</text>
  <text start="216.18" dur="4.77">career was spent at a Chicago prep firm</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="4.2">here doing fixed income arbitrage so</text>
  <text start="220.95" dur="4.59">anyways let&amp;#39;s get to it here let&amp;#39;s do we</text>
  <text start="222.63" dur="4.62">have g7 was last week we thought this</text>
  <text start="225.54" dur="2.88">headline was pretty funny macron tries</text>
  <text start="227.25" dur="3.329">to arrange a Trump meeting with the</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="3.93">Iranian leader we love this picture</text>
  <text start="230.579" dur="3.601">because yeah that&amp;#39;s basically macron</text>
  <text start="232.35" dur="3.479">fits a behind Trump in his shadow</text>
  <text start="234.18" dur="3.089">because Trump doesn&amp;#39;t listen to anybody</text>
  <text start="235.829" dur="4.38">he does what he wants he&amp;#39;s 10 steps</text>
  <text start="237.269" dur="5.371">ahead as we all know and we&amp;#39;ve we think</text>
  <text start="240.209" dur="4.601">that this statement down here</text>
  <text start="242.64" dur="3.43">lends a lot of credence do we think that</text>
  <text start="244.81" dur="4.71">that Trump wants to make an agreement</text>
  <text start="246.07" dur="5.58">with with Iran as opposed to any</text>
  <text start="249.52" dur="3.81">military action and he says if the</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="3.63">circumstances were correct or right I</text>
  <text start="253.33" dur="3.27">would certainly agree to a meeting but</text>
  <text start="255.28" dur="2.55">in the meantime they have to be good</text>
  <text start="256.6" dur="3.51">players you understand what that means</text>
  <text start="257.83" dur="3.629">Trump said of the Iranians he added</text>
  <text start="260.11" dur="3.44">later that at a given point in time that</text>
  <text start="261.459" dur="4.471">will have to be a meeting between US and</text>
  <text start="263.55" dur="4.09">Trump even went on suggesting offering</text>
  <text start="265.93" dur="3.12">lines of credit to Iran give it access</text>
  <text start="267.64" dur="3.57">to much new to her currency amid</text>
  <text start="269.05" dur="4.08">reimpose US sanctions crippling its</text>
  <text start="271.21" dur="4.59">economy moments later he repeated his</text>
  <text start="273.13" dur="4.35">criticism of former President Obama of</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="4.08">his agreement to release large sums of</text>
  <text start="277.48" dur="4.17">cash to Iran to partially settle a claim</text>
  <text start="279.88" dur="3.3">over the 1970s military equipment order</text>
  <text start="281.65" dur="3.87">and we all seen the pictures of the</text>
  <text start="283.18" dur="6.36">pallet full of hundred-dollar bills all</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="5.37">stacked and shrink wrapped nicely so we</text>
  <text start="289.54" dur="4.56">thought this was interesting that Makran</text>
  <text start="290.89" dur="6.39">we got a little bread crumb there for</text>
  <text start="294.1" dur="4.44">him to pretend that he&amp;#39;s actually doing</text>
  <text start="297.28" dur="3.48">something when we all know Trump already</text>
  <text start="298.54" dur="4.53">has everything planned out so that was</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="3.69">the g7 last week we also read earlier</text>
  <text start="303.07" dur="4.65">this week how Chinese companies have</text>
  <text start="304.45" dur="5.28">unsafe unseen foreign debt that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.72" dur="5.61">maturing fast so these tariffs are</text>
  <text start="309.73" dur="4.8">eating into the economic expansion of</text>
  <text start="313.33" dur="3.72">China even though they think they can</text>
  <text start="314.53" dur="5.16">fight it and fight it with a devaluation</text>
  <text start="317.05" dur="4.05">of the yuan their currency they really</text>
  <text start="319.69" dur="4.17">can&amp;#39;t because they really need the</text>
  <text start="321.1" dur="5.34">exports to be picked up in the end these</text>
  <text start="323.86" dur="4.74">terrorists are gonna hurt start to hurt</text>
  <text start="326.44" dur="4.14">more long term structural issues for</text>
  <text start="328.6" dur="4.89">China and they&amp;#39;ve got a lot of debt</text>
  <text start="330.58" dur="4.29">maturing and as this article points out</text>
  <text start="333.49" dur="2.79">on top of the two trillion and</text>
  <text start="334.87" dur="3.66">liabilities of foreigners captured in</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="4.05">the official data by mainland China</text>
  <text start="338.53" dur="5.61">mainland Chinese firms have around</text>
  <text start="340.33" dur="6.48">another 650 billion in debts built up so</text>
  <text start="344.14" dur="4.02">650 extra that they&amp;#39;re not reporting and</text>
  <text start="346.81" dur="3.12">who knows they could be much more than</text>
  <text start="348.16" dur="5.85">that we really can&amp;#39;t trust the numbers</text>
  <text start="349.93" dur="6.33">coming out of China and they can claim</text>
  <text start="354.01" dur="6.06">to think that that they can withstand</text>
  <text start="356.26" dur="6.6">these tariffs for indefinitely but we</text>
  <text start="360.07" dur="5.16">know that&amp;#39;s not the case our economy it</text>
  <text start="362.86" dur="5.01">cannot withstand a weaker you want and</text>
  <text start="365.23" dur="3.66">it cannot withstand these tariffs and</text>
  <text start="367.87" dur="3.66">though have to come to an agreement</text>
  <text start="368.89" dur="4.22">sooner rather than later and we thought</text>
  <text start="371.53" dur="3.6">this was an excellent you guys don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="373.11" dur="2.77">haven&amp;#39;t heard of real vision they put</text>

  <text start="397.47" dur="5.14">CCP doesn&amp;#39;t like it very much the</text>
  <text start="400.06" dur="4.71">Communist Party of China doesn&amp;#39;t like it</text>

  <text start="414.7" dur="3.06">America saying this instead of helping</text>
  <text start="416.41" dur="2.82">the economy the result will be a</text>
  <text start="417.76" dur="3.03">disaster yeah go figure</text>
  <text start="419.23" dur="2.91">cuz when you print money and you give it</text>
  <text start="420.79" dur="2.67">to the investment banks who do they</text>
  <text start="422.14" dur="3.27">think give it to it they give it to the</text>
  <text start="423.46" dur="3.66">elites doesn&amp;#39;t trickle down the economy</text>
  <text start="425.41" dur="6">they just get more and more I mean I saw</text>
  <text start="427.12" dur="6.69">a Lamborghini SUV driving around Chicago</text>
  <text start="431.41" dur="4.17">I&amp;#39;m like what what who&amp;#39;s buying this why</text>
  <text start="433.81" dur="3.99">why is Lamborghini getting into the</text>
  <text start="435.58" dur="4.02">SUV&amp;#39;s but you know what they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>

  <text start="444.67" dur="5.34">that kind of stuff as well and you know</text>
  <text start="447.28" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s just this is rinse recycle repeat</text>
  <text start="450.01" dur="4.56">you know so be of a basically says we</text>
  <text start="452.41" dur="4.05">fear this dynamic could ultimately two</text>
  <text start="454.57" dur="3.75">quantitative failure under which markets</text>
  <text start="456.46" dur="3.9">we focus on those elevated liabilities</text>
  <text start="458.32" dur="3.48">and lack of global growth which would in</text>
  <text start="460.36" dur="4.2">all likelihood lead to a material</text>
  <text start="461.8" dur="4.86">increase in volatility G go figure well</text>
  <text start="464.56" dur="3.21">an investment bank saying this but you</text>
  <text start="466.66" dur="3.72">know this is just common knowledge for</text>
  <text start="467.77" dur="4.29">any of my listeners readers and</text>
  <text start="470.38" dur="4.73">hopefully now bring it to you you guys</text>
  <text start="472.06" dur="7.05">as well that the printing money does not</text>
  <text start="475.11" dur="7.47">raise organic economic vitality what it</text>
  <text start="479.11" dur="7.41">does is it diminishes the long term</text>
  <text start="482.58" dur="6.16">growth trajectory by bringing earnings</text>
  <text start="486.52" dur="5.31">forward and so you&amp;#39;re stealing from the</text>
  <text start="488.74" dur="4.83">future and all of this theft is causing</text>
  <text start="491.83" dur="3.21">a huge wide disparity and income where</text>
  <text start="493.57" dur="2.82">the elites are taking it all and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="495.04" dur="4.47">nothing left for anyone else and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.39" dur="5.25">why you hear a lot of this mmt theory</text>
  <text start="499.51" dur="3.24">and universal basic income is because</text>
  <text start="501.64" dur="3.779">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to do something to</text>
  <text start="502.75" dur="4.08">appease the plebeians and you know are</text>
  <text start="505.419" dur="2.851">we gonna let it get that far who knows</text>
  <text start="506.83" dur="2.89">we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="508.27" dur="2.77">but as zero hedges to</text>
  <text start="509.72" dur="2.91">pointed out here there has never been so</text>
  <text start="511.04" dur="2.999">much I still began central banks even</text>
  <text start="512.63" dur="3.12">among other central banks in the past</text>
  <text start="514.039" dur="3.75">decade is over the past month something</text>
  <text start="515.75" dur="3.57">is about to snap and we agree if the</text>
  <text start="517.789" dur="4.231">central banks don&amp;#39;t act in unison and a</text>
  <text start="519.32" dur="3.99">coordination one of them box then things</text>
  <text start="522.02" dur="3.03">don&amp;#39;t work the way that they&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="523.31" dur="3.81">to it you know negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="525.05" dur="4.53">as we see around the globe those aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="527.12" dur="4.47">normal contracts of a healthy financial</text>
  <text start="529.58" dur="4.53">environment those are an artificial</text>
  <text start="531.59" dur="4.59">contract of central bank fiat fractional</text>
  <text start="534.11" dur="4.35">reserve systems that wouldn&amp;#39;t exist in a</text>
  <text start="536.18" dur="4.68">normal world we just allow it because we</text>
  <text start="538.46" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t have the power right now</text>
  <text start="540.86" dur="6">but hopefully that will change sometime</text>
  <text start="542.84" dur="5.43">soon and in terms of if you guys have</text>
  <text start="546.86" dur="2.73">never seen a Federal Reserve dot plot</text>
  <text start="548.27" dur="3.21">this is something that they put out in</text>
  <text start="549.59" dur="4.38">terms of the when they have their FOMC</text>
  <text start="551.48" dur="4.65">meetings they try to paint us a picture</text>
  <text start="553.97" dur="3.18">of the future of where they think the</text>
  <text start="556.13" dur="4.35">short-term interest rates should be</text>
  <text start="557.15" dur="4.74">which is the federal funds rate and what</text>
  <text start="560.48" dur="3.45">I wanted to point out in this chart was</text>

  <text start="1073.42" dur="3.48">look at how let&amp;#39;s look at how far this</text>
  <text start="1075.01" dur="4.17">is falling this is yields falling which</text>
  <text start="1076.9" dur="6.69">means the price went this way prices</text>

  <text start="1083.59" dur="5.6">October look at this long term Treasury</text>
  <text start="1086.1" dur="6.13">bonds have risen more than 40 percent</text>
  <text start="1089.19" dur="5.46">while the SP is dramatically lagged</text>
  <text start="1092.23" dur="6.36">behind and leaning only increasing by 7%</text>
  <text start="1094.65" dur="5.59">so this long-term Treasury give you a 40</text>
  <text start="1098.59" dur="3.78">percent return in the same nine months</text>
  <text start="1100.24" dur="3.66">is this stock did some that&amp;#39;s the SP</text>
  <text start="1102.37" dur="3.84">Varner did 7.1%</text>
  <text start="1103.9" dur="4.47">so you and the most news network</text>
  <text start="1106.21" dur="5.46">listeners should should take take that</text>
  <text start="1108.37" dur="5.39">and really try to hone in on when people</text>
  <text start="1111.67" dur="4.53">try to say who would buy bonds at 1.9%</text>
  <text start="1113.76" dur="4.15">now you have the fuel to tell them well</text>
  <text start="1116.2" dur="4.28">I can get capital appreciation when they</text>
  <text start="1117.91" dur="2.57">price right</text>
  <text start="1120.669" dur="4.99">and we&amp;#39;ve also heard this week a little</text>
  <text start="1123.23" dur="5.1">bit more talk about the dollar and you</text>
  <text start="1125.659" dur="4.171">know the one the tariff and the fighting</text>
  <text start="1128.33" dur="3.66">and how the dollars gonna eventually not</text>
  <text start="1129.83" dur="4.89">be the reserve currency well you can see</text>
  <text start="1131.99" dur="4.439">here that the u.s. dollar dominates</text>
  <text start="1134.72" dur="4.11">global trade in China where it accounts</text>
  <text start="1136.429" dur="4.921">for settlement of over eighty seven</text>
  <text start="1138.83" dur="4.979">percent votes over eighty five percent</text>
  <text start="1141.35" dur="4.23">in between 85 and 88 percent is settled</text>
  <text start="1143.809" dur="4.47">in US dollars still in the Chinese trade</text>
  <text start="1145.58" dur="4.11">so this is stagnated here we all thought</text>
  <text start="1148.279" dur="3.571">China would take more that you want</text>
  <text start="1149.69" dur="5.219">would take more and that hasn&amp;#39;t has not</text>
  <text start="1151.85" dur="7.169">happened and if we look here the shares</text>
  <text start="1154.909" dur="6.75">of a total global trade the US dollar is</text>
  <text start="1159.019" dur="4.591">still 60 nearly sixty two percent of</text>
  <text start="1161.659" dur="3.421">total global trade you&amp;#39;ve got China less</text>
  <text start="1163.61" dur="4.01">than two percent but what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="1165.08" dur="5.819">to note here is the Japanese yen is</text>
  <text start="1167.62" dur="4.84">risen 47 percent in four years so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1170.899" dur="3.561">pretty interesting we&amp;#39;d like to know of</text>
  <text start="1172.46" dur="4.559">what kind of exports are picking up</text>
  <text start="1174.46" dur="6.599">what&amp;#39;s causing the the increase in yen</text>
  <text start="1177.019" dur="6.03">usage might be a carry trade as well so</text>
  <text start="1181.059" dur="3.1">it&amp;#39;s a little bit more advanced we&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1183.049" dur="4.59">have to get into that but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1184.159" dur="5.49">interesting to note that this near two</text>
  <text start="1187.639" dur="4.951">percent is because the Chinese renminbi</text>
  <text start="1189.649" dur="5.101">was entered into the SDR s strategic</text>
  <text start="1192.59" dur="3.539">drawing rights and that&amp;#39;s why they got</text>
  <text start="1194.75" dur="2.61">this two percent but while also</text>
  <text start="1196.129" dur="3.39">interesting to note these unallocated</text>
  <text start="1197.36" dur="6.899">reserves used to be 36% now it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="1199.519" dur="6.51">five so global trade is still dominated</text>
  <text start="1204.259" dur="3.27">by the US dollar sixty two percent and</text>
  <text start="1206.029" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s not going anywhere anytime soon</text>
  <text start="1207.529" dur="5.88">but the US debt is rising and you know</text>
  <text start="1210.889" dur="4.53">it this could cause some havoc here in</text>
  <text start="1213.409" dur="5.1">the US domestic economy we&amp;#39;re not near</text>

  <text start="1259.21" dur="3.27">guys should check it out and one thing</text>
  <text start="1261.13" dur="3.41">we want to touch on that they touched on</text>
  <text start="1262.48" dur="4.23">there was this two-year tenure spread I</text>
  <text start="1264.54" dur="3.67">personally like to watch the 2-year Fed</text>
  <text start="1266.71" dur="3.57">Funds I really think that&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="1268.21" dur="5.25">indicator with Fed Funds at two and a</text>
  <text start="1270.28" dur="5.94">quarter percent right now on tenure down</text>
  <text start="1273.46" dur="4.41">at 1.5 that&amp;#39;s a negative 75 basis point</text>
  <text start="1276.22" dur="4.38">inverted curve where this one&amp;#39;s barely</text>
  <text start="1277.87" dur="6.75">inverted the twos tense but this will</text>
  <text start="1280.6" dur="5.22">this this will you know really steep an</text>
  <text start="1284.62" dur="2.79">out once the photo service starts</text>
  <text start="1285.82" dur="4.29">cutting interest rates which they will</text>
  <text start="1287.41" dur="4.26">they do a 50 basis point cut then this</text>
  <text start="1290.11" dur="3.24">thing&amp;#39;s going to start to steep and back</text>
  <text start="1291.67" dur="3.9">up here but this is a good indicator of</text>
  <text start="1293.35" dur="4.2">that the the tide of the business cycle</text>
  <text start="1295.57" dur="3.51">has turned as you can see back here</text>
  <text start="1297.55" dur="3.93">before the housing crisis really took</text>
  <text start="1299.08" dur="4.53">effect in 2008 this recession indicator</text>
  <text start="1301.48" dur="2.43">was well a year and a half in advance of</text>
  <text start="1303.61" dur="3.12">it</text>
  <text start="1303.91" dur="4.11">so this is coming up in 2020 we got the</text>
  <text start="1306.73" dur="3.81">other year-and-a-half before we really</text>
  <text start="1308.02" dur="3.539">get into trouble probably we got a rest</text>

  <text start="1312.91" dur="4.92">until the next year&amp;#39;s election so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1315.73" dur="3.57">not call stock market top yet but we do</text>
  <text start="1317.83" dur="2.91">feel things are starting to roll over in</text>
  <text start="1319.3" dur="2.61">volatilities ahead of us but this is</text>
  <text start="1320.74" dur="4.439">what they mean by inverted yield curve</text>
  <text start="1321.91" dur="5.16">where the yields on the two-year shorter</text>
  <text start="1325.179" dur="4.111">term money is higher than the yield on a</text>
  <text start="1327.07" dur="3.42">longer-term ten-year money which doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1329.29" dur="2.49">make much sense considering if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1330.49" dur="2.79">loaning out money for a longer term</text>
  <text start="1331.78" dur="3.149">you&amp;#39;d want to higher interest rate and</text>
  <text start="1333.28" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s all that means there but this is</text>
  <text start="1334.929" dur="4.561">a good business cycle indicator that a</text>
  <text start="1336.76" dur="5.07">recession is is imminent or actually we</text>
  <text start="1339.49" dur="6.9">might already be in it and this is kind</text>
  <text start="1341.83" dur="5.729">of a good leading indicator and once</text>
  <text start="1346.39" dur="2.58">again here let&amp;#39;s just take a look at the</text>
  <text start="1347.559" dur="2.761">percent of world stock market cap by</text>
  <text start="1348.97" dur="3.12">country who&amp;#39;s been the beneficiary</text>

  <text start="1352.09" dur="3.87">US by seven point six seven percent over</text>
  <text start="1354.28" dur="3.93">the rest look at everyone else almost</text>
  <text start="1355.96" dur="4.2">negative in red except for China up</text>
  <text start="1358.21" dur="3.719">three point four seven percent but you</text>
  <text start="1360.16" dur="3.06">can tell where&amp;#39;s the safety go where&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1361.929" dur="3.511">all the money go and things hit the fan</text>
  <text start="1363.22" dur="5.74">the United States and why because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1365.44" dur="5.47">got three transmitter parent markets</text>
  <text start="1368.96" dur="3.81">rules regulations while you would think</text>
  <text start="1370.91" dur="5.25">we got rules and regulations but this is</text>
  <text start="1372.77" dur="5.31">where the money flows people trust our</text>
  <text start="1376.16" dur="3.18">markets they&amp;#39;ve got integrity and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1378.08" dur="5.19">why they come here and that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="1379.34" dur="4.98">dollar is so strong but all is it rosy</text>
  <text start="1383.27" dur="2.7">guys and we don&amp;#39;t want to paint this</text>
  <text start="1384.32" dur="2.55">picture look at flat corporate profits</text>
  <text start="1385.97" dur="3.03">even with some of the lowest effective</text>
  <text start="1386.87" dur="3.78">tax rates in history so if you look back</text>
  <text start="1389" dur="4.47">here 2013 - now</text>
  <text start="1390.65" dur="5.94">corporate profits have been flat which</text>
  <text start="1393.47" dur="5.64">is crazy considering that their total</text>
  <text start="1396.59" dur="4.38">2018 gross profits for us course was two</text>
  <text start="1399.11" dur="3.72">trillion dollars but the taxes they paid</text>
  <text start="1400.97" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re only two hundred billion that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1402.83" dur="4.83">mere nine point nine percent effective</text>
  <text start="1404.93" dur="4.83">tax rate that&amp;#39;s crazy that&amp;#39;s that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1407.66" dur="4.14">the corporation will say they&amp;#39;re over</text>
  <text start="1409.76" dur="3.81">paying taxes now now the real rate is</text>
  <text start="1411.8" dur="3.57">twenty one percent but the effect the</text>
  <text start="1413.57" dur="3.11">real stated nominal rate is twenty one</text>
  <text start="1415.37" dur="2.91">percent but as we can see here</text>
  <text start="1416.68" dur="3.88">corporations don&amp;#39;t pay anywhere near</text>
  <text start="1418.28" dur="3.9">that they pay less than 50 percent of</text>
  <text start="1420.56" dur="3.09">that nine point nine percent is their</text>
  <text start="1422.18" dur="3.62">effective tax rate where if it was</text>
  <text start="1423.65" dur="6.15">higher these profits would be down here</text>
  <text start="1425.8" dur="6.55">they had to pay real taxes so just an</text>
  <text start="1429.8" dur="4.32">interesting chart there and we can see</text>
  <text start="1432.35" dur="3.42">as QE has ended and interest rates are</text>
  <text start="1434.12" dur="3.6">gonna start to go lower again the Fed</text>
  <text start="1435.77" dur="3.9">will start to add US Fed adds eight</text>
  <text start="1437.72" dur="5.58">billion and the skew is back so they</text>
  <text start="1439.67" dur="6">bought their net change in their bond</text>
  <text start="1443.3" dur="4.11">portfolio was up eight billion so as is</text>
  <text start="1445.67" dur="5.55">the start of a new QE and more bond</text>
  <text start="1447.41" dur="6.21">buying could be okay couple technical</text>
  <text start="1451.22" dur="5.58">charts here we think this winter&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1453.62" dur="5.46">come with some colds prolonged cold</text>
  <text start="1456.8" dur="3.69">snaps here and there and natural gas has</text>
  <text start="1459.08" dur="3.33">been under priced for a long not under</text>
  <text start="1460.49" dur="4.86">price but in a downtrend for a long time</text>
  <text start="1462.41" dur="4.47">here this year and it broke above here</text>
  <text start="1465.35" dur="3.78">today actually it&amp;#39;s up here now where</text>
  <text start="1466.88" dur="4.23">the yellow arrow is but we&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="1469.13" dur="4.02">look at this trendline here as a break</text>
  <text start="1471.11" dur="4.23">really want to get about two to two</text>
  <text start="1473.15" dur="4.38">point three zero but looks like that gas</text>
  <text start="1475.34" dur="3.59">might be in play here guys above 225 so</text>
  <text start="1477.53" dur="4.5">just keep to keep an eye on that for</text>
  <text start="1478.93" dur="6.1">more us to trading and investing players</text>

  <text start="1490.94" dur="5.16">strategies also the sp500 you can see</text>
  <text start="1493.76" dur="3.9">the August systemic bots have had this</text>
  <text start="1496.1" dur="3.99">in quite a tight range here this month</text>
  <text start="1497.66" dur="4.8">between twenty nine forty and twenty</text>
  <text start="1500.09" dur="4.74">eight twenty the highs and lows very</text>
  <text start="1502.46" dur="3.87">systematic this is this is all done on a</text>
  <text start="1504.83" dur="5.07">programmatic basis and we&amp;#39;re coming up</text>
  <text start="1506.33" dur="5.43">here again obviously first shots gonna</text>
  <text start="1509.9" dur="3.72">be here to sell it as what all goes will</text>
  <text start="1511.76" dur="3.03">do but if we get to break above this 29</text>
  <text start="1513.62" dur="3.27">40 lookout we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1514.79" dur="4.02">get a run to this new house most likely</text>
  <text start="1516.89" dur="3.24">or at least get a lot of players out</text>
  <text start="1518.81" dur="3.75">that I just tried to short it up here</text>
  <text start="1520.13" dur="4.26">again but is the risk back down to here</text>
  <text start="1522.56" dur="3.78">of course does this is our range so</text>
  <text start="1524.39" dur="3.02">until we get out of this range we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1526.34" dur="3.75">know if we&amp;#39;re gonna go lower or higher</text>
  <text start="1527.41" dur="4.48">but it&amp;#39;ll dictate this nice horizontal</text>
  <text start="1530.09" dur="7.5">box will dictate us where our next move</text>

  <text start="1592.11" dur="6">90 100 you&amp;#39;re gonna risk it down to here</text>
  <text start="1594.24" dur="6.179">this is the Fibonacci 786 level retraced</text>
  <text start="1598.11" dur="3.96">back here down at 70 100 we would look</text>
