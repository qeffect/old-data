  <text start="24.539" dur="7.111">wiping up to I am just nobody youtuber</text>
  <text start="29.279" dur="5.161">who started covering Q very early on</text>
  <text start="31.65" dur="6.6">Christmas Eve of last year actually yes</text>
  <text start="34.44" dur="6.029">and it&amp;#39;s it the you know I talked about</text>
  <text start="38.25" dur="3.899">how the growth was just kind of amazing</text>
  <text start="40.469" dur="5.07">at first I had about 1200 new</text>
  <text start="42.149" dur="5.791">subscribers a day yes and then on day 11</text>
  <text start="45.539" dur="3.901">the algorithm caught me but I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="47.94" dur="2.88">don&amp;#39;t take credit for that I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="49.44" dur="3.599">just that there&amp;#39;s a lot of demand out</text>
  <text start="50.82" dur="4.559">there for this kind of truth where we be</text>
  <text start="53.039" dur="4.381">without the algorithm blimey I could</text>
  <text start="55.379" dur="4.711">just do my we&amp;#39;d buy we&amp;#39;d won a long</text>
  <text start="57.42" dur="5.549">time ago wouldn&amp;#39;t we you know without</text>
  <text start="60.09" dur="5.13">the back that so I mean what about the I</text>
  <text start="62.969" dur="4.771">completely relate to your story I mean</text>
  <text start="65.22" dur="4.649">odd we called ourselves and nuns these</text>
  <text start="67.74" dur="4.47">days and that&amp;#39;s partly because of a</text>
  <text start="69.869" dur="4.141">queue culture but you know for few years</text>
  <text start="72.21" dur="4.4">I would have called myself a truth</text>
  <text start="74.01" dur="5.58">seeker or something of that nature</text>
  <text start="76.61" dur="6.16">but what I what I&amp;#39;ve loved about what</text>
  <text start="79.59" dur="5.4">I&amp;#39;ve heard about your work is your your</text>
  <text start="82.77" dur="4.889">rationality you know your your</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="4.41">objectivity that you you get you get</text>
  <text start="87.659" dur="4.32">your emotions out of it you look at the</text>
  <text start="89.4" dur="4.92">facts and you using reason and deduction</text>
  <text start="91.979" dur="3.75">and I I&amp;#39;m prepared to bet that&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="94.32" dur="4.409">good reason why you&amp;#39;ve got so many</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="5.011">subscribers so so you started off in</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="5.64">December and how are things gone since</text>
  <text start="100.74" dur="5.489">then well I&amp;#39;m you know I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="104.369" dur="3.601">building up and it was growing really</text>
  <text start="106.229" dur="3.061">quickly and then I covered something</text>
  <text start="107.97" dur="3.8">they didn&amp;#39;t want me to cover and they</text>
  <text start="109.29" dur="6.02">they banned in my entire account and</text>
  <text start="111.77" dur="6.489">just started over at this point yes and</text>
  <text start="115.31" dur="5.199">you know it&amp;#39;s been an uphill battle it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="118.259" dur="5.341">not been necessarily fun all along the</text>
  <text start="120.509" dur="4.981">way but I I would do this for free I</text>
  <text start="123.6" dur="3.54">don&amp;#39;t even care I would do it if no one</text>
  <text start="125.49" dur="5.159">was there to listen I&amp;#39;m pretty much</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="4.48">can&amp;#39;t stop well I&amp;#39;d like you to know how</text>
  <text start="130.649" dur="4.571">much</text>
  <text start="131.62" dur="7.05">I mean our group members as lanzar me</text>
  <text start="135.22" dur="4.82">over on Facebook how much they empathize</text>
  <text start="138.67" dur="4.98">with you</text>
  <text start="140.04" dur="6.64">you more recent videos and seeing how</text>
  <text start="143.65" dur="6.509">you&amp;#39;ve been struggling with hard hard</text>
  <text start="146.68" dur="5.309">information facing hard truths facing</text>
  <text start="150.159" dur="4.531">things that you didn&amp;#39;t want to have to</text>
  <text start="151.989" dur="4.981">face and as part of a challenge but we</text>
  <text start="154.69" dur="4.829">all have coming to terms of the import</text>
  <text start="156.97" dur="6.57">of queuing ins information isn&amp;#39;t it you</text>
  <text start="159.519" dur="5.701">know it&amp;#39;s very challenging at times you</text>
  <text start="163.54" dur="3.63">know Hugh actually talks about this</text>
  <text start="165.22" dur="4.56">sometimes you know those you trusted</text>
  <text start="167.17" dur="4.17">those in positions of authority you know</text>
  <text start="169.78" dur="3.45">the truth is gonna be pretty hard to</text>
  <text start="171.34" dur="4.019">handle and I always kind of assumed that</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="5.49">he meant you know specifically you know</text>
  <text start="175.359" dur="4.71">politicians and and maybe people at some</text>
  <text start="178.72" dur="3.54">of the higher levels of the Vatican</text>
  <text start="180.069" dur="3.691">things like that I didn&amp;#39;t realize that</text>
  <text start="182.26" dur="3.42">it was gonna hit me with some of the</text>
  <text start="183.76" dur="4.89">people that I used to respect and used</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="4.589">to follow myself and and I&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="188.65" dur="3.419">pretty good reaction from people because</text>
  <text start="190.269" dur="4.05">I am willing to change my position when</text>
  <text start="192.069" dur="4.621">somebody is proven to be you know</text>
  <text start="194.319" dur="5.07">misinformation but it wasn&amp;#39;t easy</text>
  <text start="196.69" dur="4.109">because they you know one guy I followed</text>
  <text start="199.389" dur="4.791">for a long time everybody probably knows</text>
  <text start="200.799" dur="8.491">who it is but he was like my number one</text>
  <text start="204.18" dur="7.899">role model for like 16 17 years and it</text>
  <text start="209.29" dur="4.919">what happe you&amp;#39;re quite welcome to name</text>
  <text start="212.079" dur="3.84">that person here because we all we all</text>
  <text start="214.209" dur="6.12">already know who that is</text>
  <text start="215.919" dur="7.68">so we don&amp;#39;t mind yeah that was that was</text>
  <text start="220.329" dur="6.27">wild that was to see to see him exposed</text>
  <text start="223.599" dur="6.631">and then to see him attack me with the</text>
  <text start="226.599" dur="6.301">way he did with deception and and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="230.23" dur="4.5">been really extraordinary I mean that</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="4.53">when we started this conversation you</text>
  <text start="234.73" dur="5.25">described yourself as a nobody you know</text>
  <text start="237.43" dur="4.86">which I mean I was you not a nobody but</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="4.439">but you know you&amp;#39;re an ordinary person</text>
  <text start="242.29" dur="5.25">just being involved in doing your bit</text>
  <text start="244.419" dur="6.121">you know I mean you could never imagined</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="5.37">in your wildest dreams that a curing on</text>
  <text start="250.54" dur="4.71">would quote one of your videos which I</text>
  <text start="252.91" dur="4.079">think was the short video where you were</text>
  <text start="255.25" dur="5.789">sharing how chat-los could be altered</text>
  <text start="256.989" dur="6.051">wasn&amp;#39;t it yeah yes to do with him to do</text>
  <text start="261.039" dur="5.601">what Q and micro</text>
  <text start="263.04" dur="4.86">there is you know there are other people</text>
  <text start="266.64" dur="4.89">out there he could have done that with</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="5.79">yes I think that it was sort of this is</text>
  <text start="271.53" dur="2.7">just my interpretation but I&amp;#39;m not a</text>
  <text start="273.69" dur="2.82">mind reader</text>
  <text start="274.23" dur="5.22">I think that it was kind of a tip of the</text>
  <text start="276.51" dur="5.04">hat to me for my work lately I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="279.45" dur="3.84">really focusing on exposing kind of the</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="4.23">people within the truth movement that</text>
  <text start="283.29" dur="4.53">are misleading others on purpose you</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="4.4">know the disinformation that we call</text>
  <text start="287.82" dur="4.77">them the fake magaz things like that</text>
  <text start="290.18" dur="4.42">it&amp;#39;s something Hugh has been encouraging</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="4.62">us to do for a while just like we had to</text>
  <text start="294.6" dur="6.27">expose the fake news and we did so very</text>
  <text start="297.21" dur="6.27">well very successfully the people having</text>
  <text start="300.87" dur="4.5">a lot more hesitancy when it&amp;#39;s coming to</text>
  <text start="303.48" dur="5.28">people that they used to trust people on</text>
  <text start="305.37" dur="6.48">our side there&amp;#39;s a lot of a lot of hate</text>
  <text start="308.76" dur="5.01">and a lot of anger coming out of even</text>
  <text start="311.85" dur="4.32">from my own viewers for when I do these</text>
  <text start="313.77" dur="4.77">things it&amp;#39;s gotten better now that key</text>
  <text start="316.17" dur="4.56">was kind of you know I guess shared it</text>
  <text start="318.54" dur="3.9">but I think that he was just kind of</text>
  <text start="320.73" dur="3.75">telling me this is the right path to go</text>
  <text start="322.44" dur="3.75">we have to expose these people you know</text>
  <text start="324.48" dur="4.68">he&amp;#39;s made comments about purifying the</text>
  <text start="326.19" dur="5.46">movement and and exposing fake magaz and</text>
  <text start="329.16" dur="4.71">how they&amp;#39;re gonna come in waves and and</text>
  <text start="331.65" dur="4.98">I see it because I&amp;#39;m so involved with</text>
  <text start="333.87" dur="4.8">the Internet I see when they when they</text>
  <text start="336.63" dur="4.26">activate they activating groups and then</text>
  <text start="338.67" dur="4.17">they activate like Jack Paar sobic for</text>
  <text start="340.89" dur="4.89">example the same day the the mainstream</text>
  <text start="342.84" dur="4.77">media the fake news media when they</text>
  <text start="345.78" dur="3.99">switched from ignoring cue and on to</text>
  <text start="347.61" dur="3.66">attacking cue and on that&amp;#39;s the same day</text>
  <text start="349.77" dur="3.51">that Jack Rizzo Vic activated when he</text>
  <text start="351.27" dur="3.84">started bashing cue all day well I mean</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="4.47">this is perfect isn&amp;#39;t it but cue has</text>
  <text start="355.11" dur="4.59">been predicting all of this hew has said</text>
  <text start="357.75" dur="4.26">watch out this will happen you know and</text>
  <text start="359.7" dur="3.75">all these attacks will start an opening</text>
  <text start="362.01" dur="3.48">of course for 4 o&amp;#39;clock in the morning</text>
  <text start="363.45" dur="3.39">update which is now notorious is when</text>
  <text start="365.49" dur="3.21">everybody gets their orders from the</text>
  <text start="366.84" dur="4.89">deep state as to what they&amp;#39;re supposed</text>

  <text start="416.41" dur="3.99">want one of the reasons I really wanted</text>
  <text start="417.82" dur="5.31">to interview you was we we&amp;#39;ve got a very</text>
  <text start="420.4" dur="5.28">similar situation here in Britain where</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;ve got a truth movement which is</text>
  <text start="425.68" dur="6.03">pretty rotten you know and a lot of</text>
  <text start="428.26" dur="6.45">people who&amp;#39;ve got bent motives and been</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="7.05">taking money on the back hand and we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="445.539" dur="6.301">of being exposed for not being quite</text>
  <text start="448.63" dur="5.94">what they should be and I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="451.84" dur="5.37">interested in your advice in how to</text>

  <text start="467.139" dur="6.15">might be the signs that would first but</text>
  <text start="469.419" dur="7.051">first make somebody ask questions well</text>
  <text start="473.289" dur="5.521">you know when I start to suspect someone</text>
  <text start="476.47" dur="5.58">I start taking notes of everything that</text>
  <text start="478.81" dur="4.68">I see that&amp;#39;s suspicious including you</text>

  <text start="496.15" dur="5.46">who has at this point been proven to be</text>
  <text start="498.13" dur="6.599">a hypocrite and a liar yes and and Mike</text>
  <text start="501.61" dur="4.8">was basically just all day for a whole</text>
  <text start="504.729" dur="3.451">day at least and I didn&amp;#39;t go back beyond</text>
  <text start="506.41" dur="3.81">a day but all day and I found more than</text>

  <text start="930.18" dur="4.65">trustworthy in any sense at all ever</text>
  <text start="932.49" dur="4.14">and don&amp;#39;t met you know false events</text>

  <text start="936.63" dur="4.769">expedience that&amp;#39;s completely a</text>
  <text start="938.91" dur="4.32">historical I mean that it&amp;#39;s really most</text>
  <text start="941.399" dur="3.511">the time when these wars are started</text>
  <text start="943.23" dur="3.39">when these events happen most of the</text>
  <text start="944.91" dur="3.39">time they&amp;#39;re there there something going</text>

  <text start="948.3" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re real victims and then a false</text>

  <text start="951.99" dur="5.01">the victims were made up entirely we had</text>
  <text start="954.63" dur="5.03">war started you know in many countries</text>
  <text start="957" dur="5.13">but in this country one famous example</text>
  <text start="959.66" dur="5.59">over in Germany was of course when</text>
  <text start="962.13" dur="6.03">Hitler burned down the rice tag so we we</text>
  <text start="965.25" dur="7.56">have this kind of a part of the playbook</text>
  <text start="968.16" dur="6.45">of the elite and in a sense and you need</text>
  <text start="972.81" dur="5.91">to have a war apart from the reason how</text>
  <text start="974.61" dur="6.51">do I solve this pretext exactly yes but</text>
  <text start="978.72" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s also the case that perhaps people</text>
  <text start="981.12" dur="5.25">misunderstand but there can be a</text>
  <text start="983.91" dur="5.19">subtlety towards something being in a</text>
  <text start="986.37" dur="4.86">box a false flag you know an event could</text>
  <text start="989.1" dur="4.59">have aspects which really aspects which</text>
  <text start="991.23" dur="5.79">are fake and that it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="993.69" dur="5.58">complicated event like for example 9/11</text>
  <text start="997.02" dur="5.069">picking out which bits true and which</text>
  <text start="999.27" dur="5.79">bits are fake just it&amp;#39;s supposed to be</text>
  <text start="1002.089" dur="5.041">hard because I always like to think that</text>
  <text start="1005.06" dur="4.95">if you can make the truth irrational and</text>
  <text start="1007.13" dur="4.709">the lie rational it&amp;#39;s very hard for the</text>
  <text start="1010.01" dur="3.9">truth to overcome the lie because you go</text>
  <text start="1011.839" dur="5.94">why do we do that then because it makes</text>
  <text start="1013.91" dur="6.33">no sense I don&amp;#39;t know might think about</text>
  <text start="1017.779" dur="4.68">that but well a lot of it&amp;#39;s just gas</text>
  <text start="1020.24" dur="4.11">lighting yeah they make obvious mistakes</text>
  <text start="1022.459" dur="3.451">but then they keep you from being able</text>
  <text start="1024.35" dur="3.42">to spread the arguments against those</text>
  <text start="1025.91" dur="3.48">mistakes and to reveal them so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1027.77" dur="4.289">sort of a suppression in a censorship</text>
  <text start="1029.39" dur="4.41">sense and then they also make the whole</text>
  <text start="1032.059" dur="4.051">darn thing so complicated that most</text>
  <text start="1033.8" dur="4.2">people just give up on it when really</text>
  <text start="1036.11" dur="3.569">just all you needs a few hours of a good</text>
  <text start="1038" dur="4.77">debate and you could have the truth out</text>
  <text start="1039.679" dur="4.441">there in a strong way move on to some</text>

  <text start="1314.33" dur="3.45">know they&amp;#39;re getting exposed these are</text>
  <text start="1315.74" dur="3.93">the mid-level guys these are the the</text>
  <text start="1317.78" dur="3.72">bureaucrats that were in positions of</text>
  <text start="1319.67" dur="4.47">authority to help those who are really</text>
  <text start="1321.5" dur="3.78">in charge and then after midterms I</text>
  <text start="1324.14" dur="3.899">think will actually start to see the</text>

  <text start="1348.169" dur="5.73">yeah I mean it seems to me but expose it</text>
  <text start="1351.979" dur="4.56">all this stuff up with dirty smelly</text>
  <text start="1353.899" dur="5.701">rotten stuff coming too out into the</text>
  <text start="1356.539" dur="5.31">public before the midterms make them</text>
  <text start="1359.6" dur="4.35">effectively really stinky and attractive</text>
  <text start="1361.849" dur="4.02">to vote for make sure that you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1363.95" dur="3.959">control of the house and Vividh their</text>
  <text start="1365.869" dur="4.44">hopes of impeaching Trump are dashed and</text>
  <text start="1367.909" dur="5.46">doomed and then there comes the hammer</text>
  <text start="1370.309" dur="5.161">but you know we may be wrong me of his</text>
  <text start="1373.369" dur="4.201">schedule might suddenly go zoom and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1375.47" dur="3.419">all happening and and you can&amp;#39;t vote for</text>

  <text start="1381.529" dur="4.98">as well wouldn&amp;#39;t it so it is my thinking</text>
  <text start="1384.649" dur="4.321">is that if he arrests a bunch of people</text>
  <text start="1386.509" dur="5.1">before midterms it especially if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1388.97" dur="4.679">running for office or something then</text>
  <text start="1391.609" dur="4.351">it&amp;#39;s gonna seem like it&amp;#39;s gonna give</text>

  <text start="1399.559" dur="3.69">trying to arrest his opposition so I</text>
  <text start="1401.629" dur="3.93">think it&amp;#39;s healthier to wait until after</text>
  <text start="1403.249" dur="4.441">plus we were just now getting the the</text>
  <text start="1405.559" dur="11.61">court systems cleaned up where it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="1418.669" dur="8.64">forward as world patriots you know learn</text>
  <text start="1424.399" dur="5.37">the logical fallacies and then as much</text>

  <text start="1837.21" dur="4.11">that the deep state cabal has had a</text>

  <text start="1843.9" dur="4.2">you know Jordan say there talks about</text>
  <text start="1846.18" dur="5.43">this it&amp;#39;s some sort of technology that</text>
  <text start="1848.1" dur="5.16">can effectively go incredibly fast and</text>
  <text start="1851.61" dur="3.6">then take a sharp left angle or</text>

  <text start="1858.78" dur="2.85">expert about these things and I try to I</text>
  <text start="1861.09" dur="2.87">try to</text>
  <text start="1861.63" dur="5.37">focus on the evil on the ground because</text>
  <text start="1863.96" dur="4.96">100% of you brother hundred something</text>
  <text start="1867" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s something before we start exploring</text>
  <text start="1868.92" dur="3.24">space and everything else I mean yeah</text>
  <text start="1870.42" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s the military aspect of it but</text>
  <text start="1872.16" dur="4.38">like I just want to I want to focus on</text>
  <text start="1874.35" dur="4.89">these these this army of evil that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1876.54" dur="4.44">facing and then and then I would love to</text>
  <text start="1879.24" dur="5.4">be part of you know exploring space and</text>

  <text start="1884.64" dur="4.68">if I thought it was young and fit enough</text>
  <text start="1886.71" dur="4.71">to go out there you know I mean I agree</text>
  <text start="1889.32" dur="5.22">with you completely that you keep it</text>
  <text start="1891.42" dur="5.25">real and I&amp;#39;m not really into the idea is</text>
  <text start="1894.54" dur="4.44">speculating about aliens for the sake of</text>
  <text start="1896.67" dur="3.72">speculating about aliens but it is</text>
  <text start="1898.98" dur="3.42">extraordinary what&amp;#39;s happening of these</text>
  <text start="1900.39" dur="3.69">observatories and it&amp;#39;s like the plot of</text>
  <text start="1902.4" dur="4.02">any science fiction film isn&amp;#39;t it if you</text>
  <text start="1904.08" dur="3.51">have a signal with you from space it</text>
  <text start="1906.42" dur="3.87">might be something happening when you</text>
  <text start="1907.59" dur="4.5">you shut it down and go all secrecy and</text>
  <text start="1910.29" dur="4.32">you deny anything&amp;#39;s happening and all</text>
  <text start="1912.09" dur="5.13">very mysterious and intriguing very</text>
  <text start="1914.61" dur="7.35">suspect yeah okay a last question for</text>
  <text start="1917.22" dur="10.8">you is there a way for Alex Jones to</text>
  <text start="1921.96" dur="11.46">redeem himself and I saved I saved a</text>
  <text start="1928.02" dur="7.38">heavy it you know I think that everyone</text>
  <text start="1933.42" dur="3.54">well and maybe not everyone I mean</text>
  <text start="1935.4" dur="3.56">there&amp;#39;s always the Hillary types but I</text>
  <text start="1936.96" dur="4.14">think that Alex has done a lot of</text>
  <text start="1938.96" dur="2.86">incidental good I don&amp;#39;t know if it was</text>
  <text start="1941.1" dur="4.47">his intention</text>
  <text start="1941.82" dur="5.82">he&amp;#39;s definitely delayed truth coming out</text>
  <text start="1945.57" dur="6.18">and and derailed a lot of big truth</text>
  <text start="1947.64" dur="6.78">topics which seems to be on purpose you</text>
  <text start="1951.75" dur="4.5">know if he were to come out and admit to</text>
  <text start="1954.42" dur="3.12">what he had done I mean it would implode</text>
  <text start="1956.25" dur="4.56">him right it would destroy his</text>
  <text start="1957.54" dur="7.38">credibility I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s likely</text>
  <text start="1960.81" dur="7.67">to ever happen he faces that anyway</text>
  <text start="1964.92" dur="6.48">doesn&amp;#39;t he yeah so I mean a man of honor</text>
  <text start="1968.48" dur="5.86">might step up and go you know I had</text>
  <text start="1971.4" dur="4.47">sinned and I&amp;#39;ve got no Americans quite</text>
  <text start="1974.34" dur="4.11">well over the last couple of years</text>
  <text start="1975.87" dur="5.04">especially and I it does need to be in</text>
  <text start="1978.45" dur="5.49">your national character but if a man</text>
  <text start="1980.91" dur="5.1">who&amp;#39;s done wrong steps up and says I</text>
  <text start="1983.94" dur="4.26">have done wrong and makes it makes a</text>
  <text start="1986.01" dur="6.02">clean breast of it it is respected by</text>
  <text start="1988.2" dur="6.12">people so what one must hope that</text>
  <text start="1992.03" dur="4.19">perhaps various about shred of</text>
  <text start="1994.32" dur="4.09">conscience in</text>
  <text start="1996.22" dur="4.41">but believe you me I mean I&amp;#39;ve done a</text>
  <text start="1998.41" dur="5.07">lot of work myself for the Peter gate</text>
  <text start="2000.63" dur="5.28">campaigning around the world so you know</text>
  <text start="2003.48" dur="5.55">he&amp;#39;s his trolley lapiz shilling around</text>
  <text start="2005.91" dur="5.31">Pizza gate was bad enough and and at the</text>
  <text start="2009.03" dur="5.04">time I sort of thought well maybe</text>
  <text start="2011.22" dur="5.51">benefit of the doubt but when when him</text>
  <text start="2014.07" dur="6.51">and course he got their arses done for</text>
  <text start="2016.73" dur="6.73">for faking cue posts and trying to steer</text>
  <text start="2020.58" dur="4.89">Patriots in the wrong direction then</text>
  <text start="2023.46" dur="5.19">that was just outrageous but then</text>
  <text start="2025.47" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;ve treated you just the same way as</text>
  <text start="2028.65" dur="5.25">they treated cue Aunt May and a lot of</text>

  <text start="2078.06" dur="4.74">redeeming himself because like from a</text>
  <text start="2080.31" dur="7.859">Machiavellian sense I think his best bet</text>
  <text start="2082.8" dur="8.43">to do that would be to betray the people</text>
