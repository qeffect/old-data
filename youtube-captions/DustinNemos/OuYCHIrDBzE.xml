  <text start="140.31" dur="2.85">the original archive queue proofs which</text>
  <text start="142.11" dur="2.58">are trying they&amp;#39;re trying to take these</text>
  <text start="143.16" dur="3">down and make sure that you actually</text>

  <text start="169.89" dur="4.08">you go decentralized folks people on the</text>
  <text start="171.96" dur="4.17">the decentralized end of things like we</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="5.79">we get it okay we understand generally</text>
  <text start="176.13" dur="6.3">speaking there is a law in France that</text>

  <text start="1276.55" dur="2.49">right now and I mentioned this in an</text>
  <text start="1277.72" dur="3.66">interview I just did with them with</text>

  <text start="1308.26" dur="3.99">of like he was he controlled opposition</text>
  <text start="1310.39" dur="5.43">on that because he seems to be when it</text>
  <text start="1312.25" dur="5.46">comes to Q and on so you know I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1315.82" dur="3.69">say that if he just disagreed with Q and</text>
  <text start="1317.71" dur="3.66">on and hadley and it was skeptical of it</text>
  <text start="1319.51" dur="2.55">or just didn&amp;#39;t cover it I would be fine</text>
  <text start="1321.37" dur="3.24">with that</text>
  <text start="1322.06" dur="4.14">but the Winnie lies about it that&amp;#39;s</text>
