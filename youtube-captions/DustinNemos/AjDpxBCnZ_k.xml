  <text start="154.34" dur="3.479">door open if they choose one day to</text>
  <text start="155.9" dur="3.18">change their mind because the more you</text>
  <text start="157.819" dur="3.03">insult them the more you&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="159.08" dur="3.48">their ego into in there just go further</text>
  <text start="160.849" dur="3.151">down their road they get cognitive</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="4.2">dissonance they get worse you know</text>
  <text start="164" dur="4.44">you&amp;#39;re making them worse and on the</text>
  <text start="166.76" dur="3.539">other hand I want to win the damn war</text>
  <text start="168.44" dur="3.75">okay I&amp;#39;m not talking about pulling</text>
  <text start="170.299" dur="3.601">punches here okay I&amp;#39;m not that is not</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="3.329">I&amp;#39;m not being weak about this and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="173.9" dur="4.32">not talking about pulling punches and</text>
  <text start="175.519" dur="5.22">I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m effectively winning the war let</text>
  <text start="178.22" dur="5.519">me explain what that means okay so there</text>
  <text start="180.739" dur="4.981">is a reason that the fake news will will</text>
  <text start="183.739" dur="5.181">plaster people like Richard Spencer the</text>
  <text start="185.72" dur="5.549">fake Republican fake Nazi guy all over</text>
  <text start="188.92" dur="3.64">you know when the guys behind like you</text>
  <text start="191.269" dur="2.791">know at the right and Charles feel and</text>
  <text start="192.56" dur="3.299">all that stuff there&amp;#39;s a reason he</text>
  <text start="194.06" dur="3.179">hasn&amp;#39;t he has no viewers he has no fan</text>
  <text start="195.859" dur="3.361">he has no audience or anything these</text>
  <text start="197.239" dur="4.681">guys can&amp;#39;t even fill up a bus to go go</text>
  <text start="199.22" dur="4.62">somewhere but there&amp;#39;s a reason that he</text>
  <text start="201.92" dur="3.93">gets so much attention from fake news</text>
  <text start="203.84" dur="3.69">they plaster him everywhere and they</text>
  <text start="205.85" dur="4.5">they try to paint him into this big dude</text>
  <text start="207.53" dur="5.1">and there&amp;#39;s a reason that they kill</text>
  <text start="210.35" dur="3.539">people like Bob Marley let me tell you a</text>
  <text start="212.63" dur="2.759">little about a little bit about Bob</text>

  <text start="215.389" dur="3.511">stuff I&amp;#39;m not alright you may not be</text>
  <text start="217.489" dur="3.06">into the pop culture</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="5.16">oh yeah I like to use it for pain you</text>
  <text start="220.549" dur="5.581">know in the past I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m a big fan of</text>
  <text start="224.06" dur="3.989">legalization I think he can help people</text>
  <text start="226.13" dur="4.829">with with addictions to opioids and</text>
  <text start="228.049" dur="4.44">stuff but I&amp;#39;m not like pop culture you</text>
  <text start="230.959" dur="2.941">know I don&amp;#39;t sit around with with reggae</text>
  <text start="232.489" dur="4.58">music playing all the time and</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="6.48">multicolored hats and and pot shirts and</text>
  <text start="237.069" dur="8.021">all that 4/20 culture I guess you call</text>
  <text start="240.38" dur="6.24">it but Bob Marley was doing a a I guess</text>
  <text start="245.09" dur="5.01">a tour but he was doing a concert one</text>
  <text start="246.62" dur="6.06">time and he was shot like numerous times</text>

  <text start="254.599" dur="6.241">and he still decided to go play no one</text>
  <text start="258.35" dur="4.11">would have no wouldn&amp;#39;t no sane</text>
  <text start="260.84" dur="2.91">individual none of his viewers none of</text>
  <text start="262.46" dur="3.329">his fans none of his audience would have</text>
  <text start="263.75" dur="5.88">blamed him for holding out because I</text>
  <text start="265.789" dur="5.821">mean he was on death&amp;#39;s bed but when he</text>
  <text start="269.63" dur="3.569">did this concert and they asked him why</text>
