  <text start="12.4" dur="3.84">hi guys welcome back this is testing</text>
  <text start="14.92" dur="2.73">with the Nemo&amp;#39;s news network</text>
  <text start="16.24" dur="3.51">if you&amp;#39;re not subscribed yet please go</text>
  <text start="17.65" dur="3.539">ahead and subscribe the little bell so</text>
  <text start="19.75" dur="4.86">you always know when new things pop up</text>
  <text start="21.189" dur="6.211">today is Wednesday July 31st 2019 and</text>
  <text start="24.61" dur="4.59">today we&amp;#39;re going to briefly go over the</text>
  <text start="27.4" dur="3.929">highlights from the Democrat debates</text>
  <text start="29.2" dur="5.1">from last night of course that was round</text>
  <text start="31.329" dur="5.761">one tonight is round two from 8:00 to</text>
  <text start="34.3" dur="4.29">10:00 p.m. Eastern and of course it may</text>
  <text start="37.09" dur="4.67">go a little bit long because last</text>
  <text start="38.59" dur="5.64">night&amp;#39;s definitely did so this one is</text>
  <text start="41.76" dur="4.419">from the New York Post they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="44.23" dur="4.219">that the winners from the democratic</text>
  <text start="46.179" dur="4.921">debate were Sanders and Warren and</text>
  <text start="48.449" dur="4.48">they&amp;#39;re saying that moderates struggled</text>
  <text start="51.1" dur="4.079">to keep the limelight now of course</text>
  <text start="52.929" dur="5.121">going into the debate Elizabeth Warren</text>
  <text start="55.179" dur="5.641">and Bernie Sanders were known as the</text>
  <text start="58.05" dur="7.54">frontrunners for this particular round</text>
  <text start="60.82" dur="6.69">and of course they avoided really going</text>
  <text start="65.59" dur="6">head to head and focused instead on</text>
  <text start="67.51" dur="5.82">attacking the moderates so healthcare</text>
  <text start="71.59" dur="3.21">took center stage at the beginning of</text>
  <text start="73.33" dur="3.57">the debate last night with Bernie</text>
  <text start="74.8" dur="4.65">Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both</text>
  <text start="76.9" dur="4.38">supporting universal health care and of</text>
  <text start="79.45" dur="4.59">course the more moderates like Tim Ryan</text>
  <text start="81.28" dur="4.77">and Hickenlooper as well as Delaney took</text>
  <text start="84.04" dur="5.48">the position that universal health care</text>
  <text start="86.05" dur="5.82">may be more of an extreme position and</text>
  <text start="89.52" dur="5.05">possibly should be avoided because it</text>
  <text start="91.87" dur="4.95">may be quote dead on arrival so Bernie</text>
  <text start="94.57" dur="4.77">Sanders did double down on his support</text>
  <text start="96.82" dur="5.16">for universal health care saying that</text>
  <text start="99.34" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s a basic human right and even going</text>
  <text start="101.98" dur="4.98">so far as to once again say that even</text>
  <text start="104.77" dur="4.08">illegal immigrants would be entitled to</text>
  <text start="106.96" dur="4.44">universal health care paid for by the</text>
  <text start="108.85" dur="5.97">American taxpayer and of course he also</text>
  <text start="111.4" dur="6.45">said that there would be no cap on how</text>
  <text start="114.82" dur="5.55">many people this would cover as if you</text>
  <text start="117.85" dur="4.98">know our pockets are bottomless or maybe</text>
  <text start="120.37" dur="5.46">he knows of a money tree somewhere that</text>
  <text start="122.83" dur="5.189">we just don&amp;#39;t know about because as it</text>
  <text start="125.83" dur="4.92">stands we don&amp;#39;t have the resources to</text>
  <text start="128.019" dur="4.11">fund universal health care coverage for</text>
  <text start="130.75" dur="4.8">every single American</text>
  <text start="132.129" dur="6.291">Plus illegal immigrants who want to</text>
  <text start="135.55" dur="4.64">cross the border in order to gain</text>
  <text start="138.42" dur="5.19">the free health care that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="140.19" dur="6.69">advertised so it&amp;#39;s more of an incentive</text>
  <text start="143.61" dur="7.76">to cross the border they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="146.88" dur="7.89">getting a lot more welfare benefits than</text>
  <text start="151.37" dur="5.589">most Americans at this point which is</text>
  <text start="154.77" dur="5.34">another reason why they&amp;#39;re flooding the</text>
  <text start="156.959" dur="5.671">borders in troves now Elizabeth Warren</text>
  <text start="160.11" dur="4.89">also supports Bernie Sanders plan and</text>
  <text start="162.63" dur="4.829">when she was asked about whether or not</text>
  <text start="165" dur="4.89">she agreed with the tax hike that would</text>
  <text start="167.459" dur="4.141">be necessary in order to pay for it she</text>
  <text start="169.89" dur="3.599">really just dodged the question and</text>
  <text start="171.6" dur="4.41">instead gave it to narak response saying</text>
  <text start="173.489" dur="4.141">that billionaires would pay for it they</text>
  <text start="176.01" dur="4.35">would pay more and that middle-class</text>
  <text start="177.63" dur="4.02">Americans would pay less well I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="180.36" dur="4.29">you must not have looked at Bernie</text>
  <text start="181.65" dur="7.35">Sanders plan because in his plan there</text>
  <text start="184.65" dur="7.05">is a four percent tax hike on families</text>
  <text start="189" dur="5.37">that make more than twenty nine thousand</text>
  <text start="191.7" dur="5.069">dollars a year twenty nine thousand</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="6.11">dollars a year is nothing it&amp;#39;s barely</text>
  <text start="196.769" dur="8.461">enough to pay for housing and food and</text>
  <text start="200.48" dur="6.12">that would be subpar housing and food so</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re not just talking about</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="4.62">middle-class Americans you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="208.65" dur="6.23">about this being the burden on the</text>
  <text start="211.22" dur="5.95">lowest level of middle-class Americans</text>
  <text start="214.88" dur="3.76">so that refutes the claim that</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="6.629">billionaires would actually be the ones</text>
  <text start="218.64" dur="7.409">paying for it also when it comes to</text>
  <text start="223.799" dur="6.03">immigration elizabeth warren had said</text>
  <text start="226.049" dur="6.951">that the criminalization of border</text>
  <text start="229.829" dur="6.181">crossing really just facilitates</text>
  <text start="233" dur="6.45">president Trump separating families at</text>
  <text start="236.01" dur="7.259">the border this of course was the go-to</text>
  <text start="239.45" dur="7.89">statement of anyone on the debate stage</text>
  <text start="243.269" dur="4.071">who is asked about immigration policies</text>
  <text start="247.4" dur="5.919">because they don&amp;#39;t really have any</text>
  <text start="249.75" dur="6.66">immigration plan none of them have a</text>
  <text start="253.319" dur="5.07">concrete plan to reform immigration they</text>
  <text start="256.41" dur="4.229">all just want to say oh we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="258.389" dur="8.571">overturn everything that Trump has done</text>
  <text start="260.639" dur="9.751">oh and he separates families well</text>
  <text start="266.96" dur="5.3">actually he&amp;#39;s just following the law</text>
  <text start="270.39" dur="5.86">that the Obama and a ministry</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="6.66">had passed so if you don&amp;#39;t like it then</text>
  <text start="276.25" dur="6.72">change it work with them to come up with</text>
  <text start="278.92" dur="10.2">common-sense immigration reform instead</text>
  <text start="282.97" dur="14.28">of just opposing him in every turn so</text>
  <text start="289.12" dur="12.15">also Bullock had said that denial of</text>
  <text start="297.25" dur="5.52">climate change is about money now of</text>
  <text start="301.27" dur="3.6">course they barely talked about the</text>
  <text start="302.77" dur="3.81">green New Deal they mentioned it for a</text>
  <text start="304.87" dur="3.69">second but no one wanted to touch it</text>
  <text start="306.58" dur="6.09">with a ten-foot pole because of course</text>
  <text start="308.56" dur="7.22">it&amp;#39;s a garbage deal so when Bullock had</text>
  <text start="312.67" dur="5.88">made this statement that opposing</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="8.11">climate change - denying climate change</text>
  <text start="318.55" dur="9.41">is about money it&amp;#39;s actually the</text>
  <text start="323.89" dur="6.36">opposite because those who are</text>
  <text start="327.96" dur="4.27">perpetuating the idea that there is</text>
  <text start="330.25" dur="7.83">man-made climate change that is a</text>
  <text start="332.23" dur="9.15">complete crisis they are funded by those</text>
  <text start="338.08" dur="9.54">who want to perpetuate this idea so if</text>
  <text start="341.38" dur="9.93">you&amp;#39;re a researcher then you want to</text>
  <text start="347.62" dur="8.03">secure your funding by making sure that</text>
  <text start="351.31" dur="10.08">your results is in line with your</text>
  <text start="355.65" dur="8.23">funders position otherwise if you</text>
  <text start="361.39" dur="4.76">somehow produce data that refutes their</text>
  <text start="363.88" dur="5.43">position then you won&amp;#39;t get the funding</text>
  <text start="366.15" dur="6.04">so that is why those who do this</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="6">research a lot of them are actually</text>
  <text start="372.19" dur="6.84">shaping their data skewing the data so</text>
  <text start="375.31" dur="7.41">that it appears that it supports the</text>
  <text start="379.03" dur="6.9">position of the funders which is that</text>
  <text start="382.72" dur="7.8">climate change is a current existential</text>
  <text start="385.93" dur="5.94">crisis but currently we have some</text>
  <text start="390.52" dur="4.08">scientists that are coming out now</text>
  <text start="391.87" dur="6.81">saying that it&amp;#39;s a complete farce which</text>
  <text start="394.6" dur="5.97">is true so you&amp;#39;re right Bullock it is</text>
  <text start="398.68" dur="6.599">about money but not in the way that</text>
  <text start="400.57" dur="6.899">you&amp;#39;re trying to present it now</text>
  <text start="405.279" dur="4.14">also when it comes to reparations bed 2</text>
  <text start="407.469" dur="3.36">or ork had said he was all about</text>
  <text start="409.419" dur="4.83">reparations now another thing about</text>
  <text start="410.829" dur="6.09">better work this article as well as some</text>
  <text start="414.249" dur="5.46">others have said that better or ork had</text>
  <text start="416.919" dur="4.86">a stronger position in this debate than</text>
  <text start="419.709" dur="4.2">in the first and then it came out</text>
  <text start="421.779" dur="4.77">stronger I would beg to differ because</text>
  <text start="423.909" dur="6.42">the whole entire time he was talking it</text>
  <text start="426.549" dur="6.99">sounded as if he was about to cry the</text>
  <text start="430.329" dur="4.86">same thing that had happened before so</text>
  <text start="433.539" dur="3.48">he sounded like he was gonna cry the</text>
  <text start="435.189" dur="5.04">whole entire time as if he was trying to</text>
  <text start="437.019" dur="9.48">evoke some kind of emotional connection</text>
  <text start="440.229" dur="8.61">with the viewers so he had said that</text>
  <text start="446.499" dur="5.7">reparations he supports them because</text>
  <text start="448.839" dur="7.26">currently the legacy of slavery is alive</text>
  <text start="452.199" dur="6.51">and well where are you coming up with</text>
  <text start="456.099" dur="5.91">this idea that the legacy of slavery is</text>
  <text start="458.709" dur="7.44">alive and well the opportunity that is</text>
  <text start="462.009" dur="7.29">available for black Americans and urban</text>
  <text start="466.149" dur="4.83">communities in this country is better</text>
  <text start="469.299" dur="5.03">than it has ever been before</text>
  <text start="470.979" dur="3.35">under the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="474.749" dur="3.79">especially when you look at what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="477.069" dur="6.18">doing with affordable housing and</text>
  <text start="478.539" dur="9.81">criminal justice reform that was</text>
  <text start="483.249" dur="6.81">President Trump prison reform that for</text>
  <text start="488.349" dur="4.97">25 years they said was never going to</text>
  <text start="490.059" dur="3.26">happen that it was impossible</text>
  <text start="493.979" dur="8.52">also Williamson had said that she</text>
  <text start="498.579" dur="10.8">proposes five hundred billion dollars in</text>
  <text start="502.499" dur="10.27">reparations as debt payment for workers</text>
  <text start="509.379" dur="8.64">wages wages that were never paid during</text>
  <text start="512.769" dur="7.82">slavery who are you gonna pay who are</text>
  <text start="518.019" dur="7.771">you gonna pay no one is alive right now</text>
  <text start="520.589" dur="7.271">that is entitled to that money so how do</text>
  <text start="525.79" dur="7.08">you determine who is entitled to that</text>
  <text start="527.86" dur="9.209">money really what reparations is about</text>
  <text start="532.87" dur="6.21">is just another avenue to offer the</text>
  <text start="537.069" dur="4.411">American people free stuff</text>
  <text start="539.08" dur="3.66">to try to gain votes same thing with</text>
  <text start="541.48" dur="3.27">universal healthcare</text>
  <text start="542.74" dur="5.43">same thing with oh let&amp;#39;s wipe away the</text>
  <text start="544.75" dur="7.56">student debt as if we can get something</text>
  <text start="548.17" dur="6.96">for nothing as if we&amp;#39;re not gonna have</text>
  <text start="552.31" dur="4.56">to pay for that somehow oh we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="555.13" dur="3.54">going to tell you that your taxes are</text>
  <text start="556.87" dur="3.54">going to be increased increase through</text>
  <text start="558.67" dur="4.62">the roof and that you&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="560.41" dur="4.53">to give away more than half of your pay</text>
  <text start="563.29" dur="3.81">in order to pay for all this</text>
  <text start="564.94" dur="3.87">quote-unquote free stuff we&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="567.1" dur="4.62">to tell you that we&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="568.81" dur="5.18">tell you that we offer you everything in</text>
  <text start="571.72" dur="5.609">the world so that you can vote for us</text>
  <text start="573.99" dur="6.27">and we also don&amp;#39;t have a concrete plan</text>
  <text start="577.329" dur="5.791">on how we&amp;#39;re going to implement anything</text>
  <text start="580.26" dur="4.93">okay the last thing I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="583.12" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s a highlight from last night was</text>
  <text start="585.19" dur="5.94">actually no I have two more things the</text>
  <text start="587.68" dur="5.61">first is that for some reason no one</text>
  <text start="591.13" dur="6.17">challenged Bernie Sanders when he said</text>
  <text start="593.29" dur="8.12">that no one is more Pro worker than him</text>
  <text start="597.3" dur="7.21">that was such an easy thing to counter</text>
  <text start="601.41" dur="6.01">why no one countered him on that I have</text>
  <text start="604.51" dur="5.87">no idea as soon as he made that</text>
  <text start="607.42" dur="9.6">statement all I could think about were</text>
  <text start="610.38" dur="9.519">the staffers that he cut their hours so</text>
  <text start="617.02" dur="6.66">he is the face of socialism he has been</text>
  <text start="619.899" dur="9.121">touting the $15 minimum wage for quite a</text>
  <text start="623.68" dur="6.87">long time now and really the $15 minimum</text>
  <text start="629.02" dur="4.68">wage it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="630.55" dur="5.15">economically because employers will</text>
  <text start="633.7" dur="3.81">always look for a way to save money</text>
  <text start="635.7" dur="4.3">because of course you want to produce</text>
  <text start="637.51" dur="6.569">the most profit and pay out the least</text>
  <text start="640" dur="5.61">amount of overhead and when it comes to</text>
  <text start="644.079" dur="5.401">these entry-level jobs because really</text>
  <text start="645.61" dur="6.39">that&amp;#39;s who is really pushing for this</text>
  <text start="649.48" dur="4.43">$15 minimum wage or those who are in</text>
  <text start="652" dur="5.31">entry-level positions</text>
  <text start="653.91" dur="6.63">cashiers fast food all of these lower</text>
  <text start="657.31" dur="6.33">level positions those are supposed to be</text>
  <text start="660.54" dur="5.62">transitory positions transitional level</text>
  <text start="663.64" dur="6.27">entry-level where if you want to make</text>
  <text start="666.16" dur="6.63">more work harder move up the ladder gain</text>
  <text start="669.91" dur="7.26">more skills so that you</text>
  <text start="672.79" dur="10.47">are worth more we don&amp;#39;t just pay you</text>
  <text start="677.17" dur="8.64">more because you&amp;#39;re working right so his</text>
  <text start="683.26" dur="5.25">staffers had unionized and demanded a</text>
  <text start="685.81" dur="4.29">$15 minimum wage and his response was to</text>
  <text start="688.51" dur="3.54">cut their hours so that he didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="690.1" dur="4.07">to pay them more so that it a verge</text>
  <text start="692.05" dur="4.44">doubt - about $15 an hour</text>
  <text start="694.17" dur="6.4">so Stanford didn&amp;#39;t make any more they</text>
  <text start="696.49" dur="6.72">just got to work less so he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="700.57" dur="4.62">that no one is more Pro worker than him</text>
  <text start="703.21" dur="2.73">really because you just got the hours of</text>
  <text start="705.19" dur="5.22">all of your people</text>
  <text start="705.94" dur="9.03">proving that opponents to the $15</text>
  <text start="710.41" dur="8.58">minimum wage are right now the last</text>
  <text start="714.97" dur="7.2">thing Tim Ryan had said that leaders</text>
  <text start="718.99" dur="5.4">presidents should not meet with</text>
  <text start="722.17" dur="4.56">dictators and he was of course referring</text>
  <text start="724.39" dur="6.27">to how President Trump had met with Kim</text>
  <text start="726.73" dur="6.86">Jung hoon you don&amp;#39;t belong in the</text>
  <text start="730.66" dur="6.18">presidential seat then if you cannot</text>
  <text start="733.59" dur="5.62">come to the table with your adversaries</text>
  <text start="736.84" dur="5.04">or potential adversaries then you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="739.21" dur="7.41">belong in the presidential seat because</text>
  <text start="741.88" dur="7.14">you have to be able to work with other</text>
  <text start="746.62" dur="4.62">foreign leaders even those who you may</text>
