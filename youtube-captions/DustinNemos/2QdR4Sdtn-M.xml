  <text start="187.81" dur="3.45">technology with without electricity</text>
  <text start="189.58" dur="4.14">basically is what they want to do to us</text>
  <text start="191.26" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s part of their agenda 2030 stuff</text>
  <text start="193.72" dur="4.62">or move us into coffin apartments in the</text>

  <text start="228.07" dur="5.76">delete Martinez they what happened there</text>
  <text start="230.92" dur="5.31">I hit the button Philippe Philippe</text>

  <text start="238.21" dur="4.17">force micron to back down quote I</text>
  <text start="240.49" dur="4.5">understand these workers anger the</text>

  <text start="244.99" dur="3.39">targeted cuts you&amp;#39;ll understand that</text>
  <text start="246.49" dur="5.07">spitting on the public service can make</text>
  <text start="248.38" dur="4.5">some of us angry and following a meeting</text>
  <text start="251.56" dur="3.36">with government officials he hinted at</text>
  <text start="252.88" dur="3.87">further cut saying quote we may amplify</text>
  <text start="254.92" dur="3.42">these kinds of methods so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="256.75" dur="2.7">actually getting and it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="258.34" dur="2.579">this I was thinking about this when I</text>
  <text start="259.45" dur="3.81">saw it but they&amp;#39;re actually getting</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="4.081">different aspects you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.26" dur="3.12">getting like the energy sector the the</text>
  <text start="265" dur="3.45">blue-collar workers are beginning to</text>
  <text start="266.38" dur="3.93">push back using their skill their trade</text>
  <text start="268.45" dur="3.63">their talent against the government</text>
  <text start="270.31" dur="4.94">which at the end of the day if you if</text>
  <text start="272.08" dur="6.36">you imagine like a doctor a teacher a</text>
  <text start="275.25" dur="4.96">plumber an electrician a you know a</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="2.94">janitor or somebody that owns a</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="3.15">restaurant a couple of different people</text>
  <text start="281.38" dur="4.23">that typically you could relate to</text>
  <text start="283.36" dur="3.66">there&amp;#39;s also that politician and he</text>
  <text start="285.61" dur="3.24">makes the rules for the other group and</text>
  <text start="287.02" dur="3.27">they bring all the value to society they</text>
  <text start="288.85" dur="3">heal the people they cook the food they</text>
  <text start="290.29" dur="4.62">do the work they build the things and</text>
  <text start="291.85" dur="6.06">they teach the kids soon arguably these</text>
  <text start="294.91" dur="4.74">days and then the politician says well</text>
  <text start="297.91" dur="3.09">all of that that stuff that you guys</text>
  <text start="299.65" dur="4.14">just did that brought value to each</text>
  <text start="301" dur="5.16">other half of its mine and it&amp;#39;s for your</text>
  <text start="303.79" dur="4.53">own good that&amp;#39;s exactly what politicians</text>
  <text start="306.16" dur="4.89">have always been doing so this is an</text>
  <text start="308.32" dur="4.2">interesting part of the whole global</text>
  <text start="311.05" dur="3.24">scheme of what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="312.52" dur="3.69">with the worldwide Great Awakening and</text>
  <text start="314.29" dur="4.85">push back against corruption that has</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="6.78">been launched largely by President Trump</text>
  <text start="319.14" dur="6.37">brexit and the Q movement now Horowitz</text>
  <text start="322.99" dur="4.98">vows a deep dive on the potential FBI</text>
  <text start="325.51" dur="4.23">surveillance abuses so this is going to</text>
  <text start="327.97" dur="4.74">get very interesting he says quote we</text>
  <text start="329.74" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t know what we don&amp;#39;t know and this</text>
  <text start="332.71" dur="5.06">is after they found the 17 errors or</text>
  <text start="335.11" dur="5.28">omissions that basically were either</text>
  <text start="337.77" dur="4.6">politically motivated lies or just</text>
  <text start="340.39" dur="4.2">really really really stupid mistakes now</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="3.84">Horowitz didn&amp;#39;t make that call but he</text>
  <text start="344.59" dur="3.42">should have and he probably could have</text>
  <text start="346.21" dur="3.959">already just owned the evidence he has</text>
  <text start="348.01" dur="4.62">but he doesn&amp;#39;t even have it all Durham</text>
  <text start="350.169" dur="4.261">and Barr have the full picture really</text>
  <text start="352.63" dur="2.42">sparked us I mean everybody&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="354.43" dur="2.209">compartment</text>
  <text start="355.05" dur="5.369">in their own investigation but we know</text>
  <text start="356.639" dur="7.31">Durham&amp;#39;s investigation is massive so we</text>
  <text start="360.419" dur="5.551">also have a bar on commis seven layers</text>
  <text start="363.949" dur="3.851">comments about how it&amp;#39;s really just</text>
  <text start="365.97" dur="3.81">seven layers beneath him and it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="367.8" dur="4.38">small stuff and high level officials</text>
  <text start="369.78" dur="3.33">wouldn&amp;#39;t mess with this and of course</text>
  <text start="372.18" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s not his fault</text>
  <text start="373.11" dur="4.2">well bar says except that you pulled it</text>
  <text start="375.78" dur="3.419">over the top and everything was done</text>
  <text start="377.31" dur="4.139">hush-hush from top down on this</text>
  <text start="379.199" dur="4.5">particular case right so let&amp;#39;s check out</text>
  <text start="381.449" dur="5.59">what he says</text>
  <text start="383.699" dur="5.35">he said I was seven steps removed from</text>
  <text start="387.039" dur="4.65">what was going on the director doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="389.049" dur="4.11">get involved in in these kinds of things</text>
  <text start="391.689" dur="5.43">the actual investigation do you believe</text>
  <text start="393.159" dur="5.67">that no I think that the one of the</text>
  <text start="397.119" dur="3.84">problems with what happened was</text>
  <text start="398.829" dur="4.68">precisely that they pulled the</text>
  <text start="400.959" dur="6.18">investigation up to the executive floors</text>
  <text start="403.509" dur="6.69">and it was run and bird dogged by a very</text>
  <text start="407.139" dur="5.16">small group of very high-level officials</text>
  <text start="410.199" dur="6.47">and the idea that this was seven layers</text>
  <text start="412.299" dur="4.37">below him is simply not true</text>
  <text start="417.24" dur="6.899">and there you have it not true</text>
  <text start="421.199" dur="4.56">so Sinnott can&amp;#39;t quit even if house with</text>
  <text start="424.139" dur="3.241">holds articles of impeachment sand</text>
  <text start="425.759" dur="3.601">Pelosi sees as she just said she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="427.38" dur="5.129">trying to withhold the articles of</text>
  <text start="429.36" dur="4.559">impeachment so she can avoid actually</text>
  <text start="432.509" dur="3.06">going in there and getting beaten until</text>
  <text start="433.919" dur="4.291">she can figure out how to cheat and when</text>
  <text start="435.569" dur="4.591">in the Senate so this is not legal it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.21" dur="3.63">not constitutional this is just dirty</text>
  <text start="440.16" dur="3.03">politics and they don&amp;#39;t have the power</text>
  <text start="441.84" dur="4.259">to pull it off that&amp;#39;s really what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.19" dur="6.18">all about at the end so we have the</text>
  <text start="446.099" dur="5.82">Senate about to acquit anyway so we also</text>
  <text start="449.37" dur="4.71">have bar saying Comey is lying over an</text>
  <text start="451.919" dur="5.041">attempt to distance himself from the FBI</text>
  <text start="454.08" dur="4.38">this is a pretty big deal and he says</text>
  <text start="456.96" dur="3.389">that that&amp;#39;s simply not true</text>
  <text start="458.46" dur="6.06">quote the idea that this was seven</text>
  <text start="460.349" dur="5.401">layers below him is simply not true and</text>
  <text start="464.52" dur="5.13">of course we just kind of covered that a</text>
  <text start="465.75" dur="6.09">bit ago as well and we have bill Binney</text>
  <text start="469.65" dur="3.6">for those who are familiar with him I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="471.84" dur="4.259">interviewed him on the channel as well</text>
  <text start="473.25" dur="6.509">former NSA technical director one of the</text>
  <text start="476.099" dur="5.37">top you know cyber spy types in the</text>
  <text start="479.759" dur="3.991">world I mean he can understand that code</text>
  <text start="481.469" dur="4.021">right and he was on over the NSA</text>
  <text start="483.75" dur="4.65">technical area for a while so he</text>
  <text start="485.49" dur="6.33">understands data he understands files he</text>
  <text start="488.4" dur="5.4">understands hacks he understands you</text>
  <text start="491.82" dur="3.659">know encryption and protection of data</text>
  <text start="493.8" dur="4.23">and things like that and he understands</text>
  <text start="495.479" dur="4.44">the situation around the DNC server that</text>
  <text start="498.03" dur="3.6">was supposedly hacked by Russia which</text>
  <text start="499.919" dur="3.331">wasn&amp;#39;t which he has already proven</text>
  <text start="501.63" dur="3.779">numerous times and then Seth rich was</text>
  <text start="503.25" dur="4.199">murdered in my opinion to cover it up</text>
  <text start="505.409" dur="4.081">and I think Donna Brazile had something</text>
  <text start="507.449" dur="3.661">to do with that as well with the lies</text>
  <text start="509.49" dur="5.039">around where she was that morning she</text>
  <text start="511.11" dur="7.109">was at the hospital now with Seth rich</text>
  <text start="514.529" dur="5.19">at like 4:00 a.m. anyway so we have him</text>

  <text start="519.719" dur="4.081">other things as well he&amp;#39;d already proven</text>
  <text start="522.479" dur="3.451">that the speed with which those files</text>
  <text start="523.8" dur="4.409">had transferred from the DNC to</text>

  <text start="529.62" dur="4.35">the past just a little thumb drive</text>
  <text start="531.56" dur="4.45">otherwise it would not have been able to</text>

  <text start="540.24" dur="4.89">no matter what you think but now</text>
  <text start="542.22" dur="5.43">speaking about the Russians he says</text>
  <text start="545.13" dur="4.53">quote I basically have always been</text>
  <text start="547.65" dur="2.9">saying that all of this Russian hack</text>

  <text start="552.35" dur="5.07">recently we haven&amp;#39;t published it yet but</text>
  <text start="554.839" dur="4.23">what we have seen is that there are at</text>
