  <text start="241.63" dur="6.69">been pushed since the beginning logical</text>

  <text start="248.32" dur="4.77">appoint a second Special Counsel in DC</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="4.351">aka the corrupt swamp but sessions</text>
  <text start="253.09" dur="4.019">should appoint a second special counsel</text>
  <text start="254.56" dur="4.26">in DC e aka the corrupt swamp which</text>
  <text start="257.109" dur="3.961">would generally be a team of less than</text>
  <text start="258.82" dur="3.99">twenty typically and wait two to four</text>
  <text start="261.07" dur="3.96">years and take a gamble that they might</text>
  <text start="262.81" dur="4.14">actually get anything accomplished but</text>
  <text start="265.03" dur="4.62">session should appoint a second special</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="4.71">counsel because unlike the Clinton email</text>

  <text start="273.88" dur="3.86">this will this one would be conducted</text>
  <text start="275.89" dur="4.71">faithfully and honestly like Mueller</text>
  <text start="277.74" dur="4.5">kind of makes me think but we should try</text>

  <text start="282.24" dur="5.47">they never understand it&amp;#39;s been tried</text>

  <text start="287.71" dur="6.57">really mess dem aside death by</text>
  <text start="290.62" dur="5.25">government but huber has not directly</text>
  <text start="294.28" dur="3.42">interviewed several witnesses and</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="3.66">therefore the appointee by appointment</text>
  <text start="297.7" dur="3.77">of huber by sessions and therefore the</text>
  <text start="299.53" dur="4.889">IG is not genuine</text>
  <text start="301.47" dur="5.59">but the sessions in Huber are following</text>
  <text start="304.419" dur="4.531">standard DOJ open ongoing investigation</text>
  <text start="307.06" dur="3.6">policy by not discussing and making</text>
  <text start="308.95" dur="4.8">public so therefore nothing must be</text>
  <text start="310.66" dur="6.03">happening so we should fire sessions but</text>
  <text start="313.75" dur="5.46">Huber ability to prosecute plus impanel</text>
  <text start="316.69" dur="4.68">a grand jury outside of DC 90 plus</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="4.86">percent voted for Hillary in DC remember</text>
  <text start="321.37" dur="4.23">that in 2016 who already began the</text>
  <text start="324.07" dur="5.73">investigations late last year with a</text>
  <text start="325.6" dur="8.25">sign team of 470 compare that to the you</text>

  <text start="336.099" dur="3.75">legal jurisdiction across all 50 states</text>
  <text start="337.87" dur="2.32">is not a Special Counsel so therefore</text>
  <text start="339.849" dur="2.621">nothing</text>
  <text start="340.19" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s being done this is way better this</text>
  <text start="342.47" dur="6.32">is way better than a Special Counsel 50</text>
  <text start="345.8" dur="5.67">times better than a Special Counsel but</text>
  <text start="348.79" dur="4.33">POTUS is attacking sessions via Twitter</text>
  <text start="351.47" dur="3.62">so therefore he is not working on behalf</text>
  <text start="353.12" dur="4.2">of the people&amp;#39;s interest or POTUS &amp;#39;as</text>
  <text start="355.09" dur="4.36">democrats and left love and trust</text>

  <text start="361.16" dur="6.15">checkers 4d chess okay they have now</text>
  <text start="364.04" dur="4.56">positioned jeff Sessions who is really</text>
  <text start="367.31" dur="2.91">working behind the scenes to make</text>
  <text start="368.6" dur="3.54">everything happen the way it needs to</text>
  <text start="370.22" dur="4.11">happen and bring justice to these guys</text>
  <text start="372.14" dur="5.97">and ongoing investigations and fifty</text>
  <text start="374.33" dur="5.61">thousand plus sealed indictments but the</text>
  <text start="378.11" dur="3.48">Democrats have been played they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="379.94" dur="3.33">tricked into supporting Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="381.59" dur="3.75">and defending him because Trump said</text>
  <text start="383.27" dur="4.59">some bad things about him possibly on</text>
  <text start="385.34" dur="4.47">Twitter you know some encouragement for</text>
  <text start="387.86" dur="5.58">him to do his job everything else you</text>
  <text start="389.81" dur="6.9">know so they&amp;#39;ve just fell right into the</text>
  <text start="393.44" dur="4.83">trap but interestingly if nothing is</text>
  <text start="396.71" dur="3.42">being done behind the scenes why are so</text>
  <text start="398.27" dur="3.63">many FBI and DOJ senior officials being</text>

  <text start="409.49" dur="5.82">anyway DOJ in charge of FBI but</text>
  <text start="413.48" dur="4.23">interestingly if nothing is being done</text>
  <text start="415.31" dur="4.58">behind the scenes why are there 50,000</text>
  <text start="417.71" dur="8.1">plus sealed indictments across the u.s.</text>
  <text start="419.89" dur="7.33">what percent of equals USA v X that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="431.36" dur="3.559">through these sealed indictments that</text>
  <text start="432.5" dur="6.96">would be interesting to note and track</text>
  <text start="434.919" dur="6.281">coincidence versus Huber start but</text>
  <text start="439.46" dur="3.45">interestingly if nothing is being done</text>
  <text start="441.2" dur="4.32">behind the scenes why are so many</text>
  <text start="442.91" dur="5.37">powerful CEOs members of Congress and</text>

  <text start="809.86" dur="3.149">just too many people in the board now</text>
  <text start="811.24" dur="8.42">there&amp;#39;s just so much activity in traffic</text>

  <text start="865.82" dur="5.5">Roswell obviously a reference to aliens</text>
  <text start="868.89" dur="4.08">here I don&amp;#39;t really go for the whole</text>
  <text start="871.32" dur="3.69">alien stuff because I&amp;#39;m so focused on</text>
  <text start="872.97" dur="3.21">evil on the ground I mean obviously if</text>
  <text start="875.01" dur="2.55">you think about the mathematical</text>

  <text start="881.79" dur="6.27">stupidity of you know your average sjw</text>
  <text start="884.91" dur="6.51">but Einstein I think it was that said</text>
  <text start="888.06" dur="5.399">the only two things are infinite the</text>
  <text start="891.42" dur="3.87">universe and was it human I think he</text>
  <text start="893.459" dur="5.101">said human stupidity and I&amp;#39;m not sure</text>
  <text start="895.29" dur="7.88">about the former he said but yeah</text>
  <text start="898.56" dur="8.57">absolutely so Q says no we&amp;#39;re not alone</text>
  <text start="903.17" dur="7.539">he says no highest classification</text>
  <text start="907.13" dur="5.32">consider the vastness of space so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="910.709" dur="5.011">saying exactly basically what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="912.45" dur="6.06">here mathematically the odds of us being</text>

  <text start="926.85" dur="5.22">proof that there is some life out in the</text>
  <text start="928.65" dur="5.07">universe but a question is is there</text>
  <text start="932.07" dur="3.209">intelligent life in the universe and and</text>
  <text start="933.72" dur="4.559">even then the mathematical odds of it</text>
  <text start="935.279" dur="5.31">are pretty high question is are we even</text>
  <text start="938.279" dur="4.951">on the same wavelength as they are I</text>
  <text start="940.589" dur="4.471">mean are they even interested in talking</text>
  <text start="943.23" dur="4.47">to us at all are they so far advanced</text>
