  <text start="0.74" dur="5.41">hey guys welcome back destiny most here</text>
  <text start="3.78" dur="3.78">and I&amp;#39;m just had a thought I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="6.15" dur="4.08">leave my mind so I wanted to share it</text>
  <text start="7.56" dur="5.22">real briefly I&amp;#39;ve talked a little bit</text>
  <text start="10.23" dur="5.43">about the power of ostracism in the past</text>
  <text start="12.78" dur="5.91">and more recently I&amp;#39;ve talked about the</text>
  <text start="15.66" dur="7.68">power of using shaming for a positive</text>
  <text start="18.69" dur="6.78">influence on society and this this this</text>
  <text start="23.34" dur="3.84">idea is very counterintuitive to a lot</text>
  <text start="25.47" dur="3.059">of people because good moral people</text>
  <text start="27.18" dur="2.939">don&amp;#39;t want to get in arguments good</text>
  <text start="28.529" dur="3.181">moral people don&amp;#39;t want to start fights</text>
  <text start="30.119" dur="5.971">good moral people don&amp;#39;t want to be mean</text>
  <text start="31.71" dur="7.95">to people unfortunately the effect all</text>
  <text start="36.09" dur="6.629">too often of being turned the other</text>
  <text start="39.66" dur="5.01">cheek or look the other way or or the</text>
  <text start="42.719" dur="4.741">idea of being accepting of all</text>
  <text start="44.67" dur="4.65">differences it leads us into moral decay</text>
  <text start="47.46" dur="4.11">it leads us into a place in the world</text>
  <text start="49.32" dur="3.899">where everything goes and evil is</text>
  <text start="51.57" dur="3.69">considered to be normal and it&amp;#39;s become</text>
  <text start="53.219" dur="4.261">mainstream and now if you speak against</text>
  <text start="55.26" dur="3.959">it and you have morals and you actually</text>
  <text start="57.48" dur="2.879">stand up for your morals you&amp;#39;re the bad</text>
  <text start="59.219" dur="4.861">person because you&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="60.359" dur="5.701">closed-minded okay an open mind is a</text>
  <text start="64.08" dur="6.329">good thing a mind it&amp;#39;s so open that</text>
  <text start="66.06" dur="6.809">anything can get in is a bad thing and I</text>
  <text start="70.409" dur="4.771">want to touch on the topic of social</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="6.39">ostracism and the power of shaming for</text>
  <text start="75.18" dur="7.259">for seeking virtue and seeking a more</text>
  <text start="79.259" dur="6.451">balanced and mortal world and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="82.439" dur="6.031">do this in light and context of the</text>
  <text start="85.71" dur="4.71">culture war that&amp;#39;s going on so you have</text>
  <text start="88.47" dur="5.789">my mic a little closer just in case you</text>
  <text start="90.42" dur="5.82">can&amp;#39;t hear me so you have the left which</text>
  <text start="94.259" dur="4.021">which you have to be open-minded about</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="3.9">everything that they like all the sexual</text>
  <text start="98.28" dur="4.199">depravity you know pedophilia being</text>
  <text start="100.14" dur="5.22">normalized all it transgenderism</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="5.42">abortion all of the immoral things that</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="7.77">they do the things that have victims or</text>
  <text start="107.899" dur="8.171">create problems in society okay and if</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="5.82">you&amp;#39;re not you&amp;#39;re not being politically</text>
  <text start="116.07" dur="6.089">correct okay and the reason that the</text>
  <text start="118.95" dur="4.709">left has in the past won the culture war</text>
  <text start="122.159" dur="3.39">which we&amp;#39;ve talked about you&amp;#39;ve heard it</text>
  <text start="123.659" dur="3.691">before the culture war right and</text>
  <text start="125.549" dur="3.841">politics is downstream from cultures so</text>
  <text start="127.35" dur="2.689">the culture war is really where the war</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="3.83">is</text>
  <text start="130.039" dur="4.711">the reason that the left is so good at</text>
  <text start="133.22" dur="3.45">winning the culture war and has been</text>
  <text start="134.75" dur="4.2">kicking Conservatives ass until Trump</text>
  <text start="136.67" dur="5.099">just left and right they&amp;#39;ve been really</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="5.069">dominating is because they understand</text>
  <text start="141.769" dur="5.491">the power of shame okay they understand</text>
  <text start="144.019" dur="5.701">the power of ostracism in fact it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.26" dur="6">their primary weapon aside from</text>
  <text start="149.72" dur="5.849">victimhood which it goes together of</text>
  <text start="153.26" dur="5.58">course I&amp;#39;m the victim therefore lash out</text>
  <text start="155.569" dur="6.181">I&amp;#39;m a victim therefore shame you that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="5.28">that&amp;#39;s kind of how the left works and</text>
  <text start="161.75" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so effective because the</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="5.72">number one thing people fear more than</text>
  <text start="165.56" dur="7.41">death or anything else as a herd animal</text>
  <text start="169.84" dur="9.819">sorry it&amp;#39;s being kicked out of the herd</text>
  <text start="172.97" dur="8.01">right Savior stop it crazy dogs so the</text>
  <text start="179.659" dur="3.75">number one thing that you fear as a herd</text>
  <text start="180.98" dur="4.649">animal is being ostracized and kicked</text>
  <text start="183.409" dur="4.98">out of the herd it&amp;#39;s more powerful than</text>
  <text start="185.629" dur="5.071">any other punishment possibly even fear</text>
  <text start="188.389" dur="4.111">of death fear violence fear of pain or</text>
  <text start="190.7" dur="5.21">fear of imprisonment which are the kind</text>
  <text start="192.5" dur="7.109">of things that we currently use to</text>
  <text start="195.91" dur="6.52">disincentivize bad behavior okay so</text>
  <text start="199.609" dur="4.47">shame is a tool it could be used by</text>
  <text start="202.43" dur="3.779">bullies you know it could be used by</text>
  <text start="204.079" dur="4.981">people that are immoral like the left</text>
  <text start="206.209" dur="4.771">pushing their view on us and shaming us</text>
  <text start="209.06" dur="3.149">for not agreeing with them okay because</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="2.339">anytime you don&amp;#39;t agree with them you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.209" dur="4.051">not being politically correct what do</text>
  <text start="213.319" dur="4.26">they do they but we caught you they try</text>
  <text start="216.26" dur="3.629">to get you fired from your job</text>
  <text start="217.579" dur="4.081">they they they insult you to your face</text>
  <text start="219.889" dur="4.051">they try to make you feel guilty</text>
  <text start="221.66" dur="5.88">shame shame shame shame shame it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="223.94" dur="4.829">it is and the right doesn&amp;#39;t do that the</text>
  <text start="227.54" dur="2.789">rights like well I don&amp;#39;t agree with you</text>
  <text start="228.769" dur="3.09">about understand I&amp;#39;m just gonna I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="230.329" dur="3.181">gonna hold my peace I&amp;#39;m not gonna say</text>
  <text start="231.859" dur="4.47">anything about it okay that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="233.51" dur="5.939">lose that&amp;#39;s why we always lose so why we</text>
  <text start="236.329" dur="4.861">always give ground that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re here</text>
  <text start="239.449" dur="3.72">and they&amp;#39;re here and then we have to</text>
  <text start="241.19" dur="3.329">compromise and then we have to</text>
  <text start="243.169" dur="2.94">compromise again then we have to</text>
  <text start="244.519" dur="4.5">compromise again until we&amp;#39;re right where</text>
  <text start="246.109" dur="5.09">they wanted us gun rights or any other</text>
  <text start="249.019" dur="2.18">issue</text>
  <text start="252.36" dur="8.45">so the power of shame is sort of the</text>
  <text start="257.34" dur="6.39">only way to disincentivize bad behavior</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="4.54">which is it&amp;#39;s always gonna happen there</text>
  <text start="263.73" dur="2.04">evils out there there&amp;#39;s psychopaths out</text>
  <text start="265.35" dur="2.28">there</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="3.93">I feel no emotion or anything like that</text>
  <text start="267.63" dur="4.89">they have the lizard brain with no</text>
  <text start="269.7" dur="4.16">emotion no empathy no sympathy about</text>
  <text start="272.52" dur="3.69">four to six percent of the population</text>
  <text start="273.86" dur="7.6">you&amp;#39;ve met them in your life don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="276.21" dur="7.47">it in many cases so evil is there but</text>
  <text start="281.46" dur="4.32">the power of shame when used</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="6.21">appropriately is the one thing that we</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="7.08">can do to correct or try to correct bad</text>
  <text start="289.89" dur="6.69">behavior that does not involve any sort</text>
  <text start="292.86" dur="5.19">of aggression okay because you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="296.58" dur="4.05">expressing your opinion you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="4.71">expressing your your right to speak and</text>
  <text start="300.63" dur="3.15">your right to associate or not associate</text>
  <text start="302.76" dur="4.29">with people that you don&amp;#39;t agree with</text>
  <text start="303.78" dur="4.89">okay so you don&amp;#39;t have to send the</text>
  <text start="307.05" dur="3.54">police after someone like if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="308.67" dur="3.05">smoking pot or they&amp;#39;re smoking dope or</text>
  <text start="310.59" dur="3.63">whatever it is that you don&amp;#39;t agree with</text>
  <text start="311.72" dur="4.48">don&amp;#39;t be around them okay that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="4.23">power of ostracism or say it look that</text>
  <text start="316.2" dur="4.26">stupid don&amp;#39;t do it that&amp;#39;s the power of</text>
  <text start="318.45" dur="3.75">shame and if they continue to do it</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="4.95">don&amp;#39;t be around then that&amp;#39;s the power of</text>
  <text start="322.2" dur="5.79">ostracism okay that speaks louder than</text>
  <text start="325.41" dur="3.99">sending the police to their home to</text>
  <text start="327.99" dur="4.65">kidnap them or take their money or</text>
  <text start="329.4" dur="5.31">extort them with violence it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="332.64" dur="3.84">powerful than the turning the other</text>
  <text start="334.71" dur="3.3">cheek and acceptance approach because</text>
  <text start="336.48" dur="3.81">you accept a drug addict they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="338.01" dur="5.18">gonna stay a drug addict obviously you</text>
  <text start="340.29" dur="9.21">don&amp;#39;t correct bad behavior by acceptance</text>
  <text start="343.19" dur="8.62">you you are able to push back in a</text>
  <text start="349.5" dur="6.27">peaceful way that&amp;#39;s the power of shame</text>
  <text start="351.81" dur="6.33">and ostracism so the idea and this is a</text>
  <text start="355.77" dur="7.41">problem with with the Conservatives</text>
  <text start="358.14" dur="7.44">Christians the right more intelligent</text>
  <text start="363.18" dur="3.93">people because we tend to be less</text>
  <text start="365.58" dur="3.33">confrontational we don&amp;#39;t tend to be as</text>
  <text start="367.11" dur="6.119">aggressive you know lower IQs tend to be</text>
  <text start="368.91" dur="6.54">more aggressive we need to utilize this</text>
  <text start="373.229" dur="3.931">tool and we need to use it to push back</text>
  <text start="375.45" dur="3.39">against the politically correct nature</text>
  <text start="377.16" dur="3.569">we need to use those tools against the</text>
  <text start="378.84" dur="3.47">enemy that they&amp;#39;ve been using against us</text>
  <text start="380.729" dur="4.321">because those are the tools that work</text>
  <text start="382.31" dur="3.249">shame and ostracism are very potent</text>
  <text start="385.05" dur="2.879">weapon</text>
  <text start="385.559" dur="6.27">and their vote they&amp;#39;re potent nonviolent</text>
  <text start="387.929" dur="6.03">weapons okay in the culture war so for</text>
  <text start="391.829" dur="5.34">the people that think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="393.959" dur="6.08">distasteful at best or or outright</text>
  <text start="397.169" dur="7.5">malicious and mean and bullying at worst</text>
  <text start="400.039" dur="5.83">you know I I all I can do is you know I</text>
  <text start="404.669" dur="2.49">want to point out a couple things for</text>
  <text start="405.869" dur="2.43">you to consider you know obviously</text>
  <text start="407.159" dur="2.91">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people out there that</text>
  <text start="408.299" dur="4.05">think this is immoral or wrong or or</text>
  <text start="410.069" dur="4.7">don&amp;#39;t judge others that kind of attitude</text>
  <text start="412.349" dur="2.42">I get that a lot</text>
  <text start="416.329" dur="6.55">what do you think that attitude will</text>
  <text start="420.089" dur="5.54">have as this culture war plays out on</text>
  <text start="422.879" dur="6.27">the behaviors that you see as</text>
  <text start="425.629" dur="6.07">unacceptably immoral if you see like for</text>
  <text start="429.149" dur="4.11">example abortion if you think the idea</text>
  <text start="431.699" dur="3.78">of not judging people for getting</text>
  <text start="433.259" dur="6.66">abortions do you think that will create</text>
  <text start="435.479" dur="6.51">more or less abortions you know we have</text>
  <text start="439.919" dur="5.52">a little historical context for this way</text>
  <text start="441.989" dur="5.34">back when okay when nobody got abortions</text>
  <text start="445.439" dur="4.08">and if you did or you got pregnant out</text>
  <text start="447.329" dur="3.69">of wedlock or any of that stuff you you</text>
  <text start="449.519" dur="2.94">would be ostracized from society like</text>
  <text start="451.019" dur="2.49">your parents would hide you they would</text>
  <text start="452.459" dur="2.22">probably have to take care of you rest</text>
  <text start="453.509" dur="4.02">your life because no man is gonna want</text>
  <text start="454.679" dur="4.71">you that was the power of social</text>
  <text start="457.529" dur="4.41">ostracism and women tried really hard</text>
  <text start="459.389" dur="3.99">not to get pregnant might affect out of</text>
  <text start="461.939" dur="5.19">wedlock and they tried really hard not</text>
  <text start="463.379" dur="6.6">to get an abortion okay same thing with</text>
  <text start="467.129" dur="5.15">with single motherhood and raising</text>
  <text start="469.979" dur="4.77">children in a single-parent home</text>
  <text start="472.279" dur="4.36">obviously if you&amp;#39;re a widow or someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="474.749" dur="4.56">died that&amp;#39;s not your fault there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="476.639" dur="5.34">shame attached but but doing so because</text>
  <text start="479.309" dur="4.05">you made bad choices in a mate and a</text>
  <text start="481.979" dur="2.97">partner and then they became a bad</text>
  <text start="483.359" dur="4.26">person</text>
  <text start="484.949" dur="4.53">my dad chose a terrible mom right like</text>
  <text start="487.619" dur="3.72">it for me she became a drug addict she</text>
  <text start="489.479" dur="4.59">became a prostitute I was basically</text>
  <text start="491.339" dur="7.41">raised by my dad and my grandparents</text>
  <text start="494.069" dur="6.72">okay so I never got to have a two-parent</text>
  <text start="498.749" dur="3.72">household until I was already looking my</text>
  <text start="500.789" dur="3.06">teenagers and had my grandparents thank</text>
  <text start="502.469" dur="3.18">God</text>
  <text start="503.849" dur="4.02">very thankful for that because it kind</text>
  <text start="505.649" dur="4.071">of gave me that perspective a little bit</text>
  <text start="507.869" dur="3.781">but</text>
  <text start="509.72" dur="3.309">generally speaking single-parent</text>
  <text start="511.65" dur="4.86">household household will destroy</text>
  <text start="513.029" dur="5.611">children and you can see this in the the</text>
  <text start="516.51" dur="5.719">rising rates of criminality among young</text>
  <text start="518.64" dur="6.21">people the rising rates of stupidity and</text>
  <text start="522.229" dur="4.841">selfishness and all of the bad all the</text>
  <text start="524.85" dur="5.16">bad traits are just everywhere they</text>
  <text start="527.07" dur="4.88">don&amp;#39;t get that balance of masculine and</text>
  <text start="530.01" dur="3.96">feminine they know they don&amp;#39;t get that</text>
  <text start="531.95" dur="5.98">generally the father is missing they</text>
  <text start="533.97" dur="8.1">don&amp;#39;t get that discipline a father would</text>
  <text start="537.93" dur="6.779">instill on them so all of these bad</text>
  <text start="542.07" dur="5.7">behaviors we could correct but we&amp;#39;re too</text>
  <text start="544.709" dur="4.44">afraid to do so because we don&amp;#39;t wanna</text>
  <text start="547.77" dur="2.49">be confrontational or we don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="549.149" dur="5.041">be considered mean or we don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="550.26" dur="5.55">judge people you know there there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="554.19" dur="3.839">virtue in the idea of not judging others</text>
  <text start="555.81" dur="4.339">okay no one&amp;#39;s perfect I&amp;#39;m not perfect</text>
  <text start="558.029" dur="6.241">either</text>
  <text start="560.149" dur="5.801">but I think in striving to be better we</text>
  <text start="564.27" dur="5.009">have to also oppose worse</text>
  <text start="565.95" dur="7.34">I think part of the path of being a good</text>
  <text start="569.279" dur="6.87">person is to stop and oppose bad things</text>
  <text start="573.29" dur="4.96">and I&amp;#39;ve kind of dedicated my life even</text>
  <text start="576.149" dur="3.81">before youtubing this is this is my</text>
  <text start="578.25" dur="4.11">hobby I mean this is what I do for fun</text>
  <text start="579.959" dur="3.841">this is this is what I do because I</text>

  <text start="766.71" dur="3.6">take care of them</text>
  <text start="767.58" dur="4.08">and turn turn her cheek and ignore all</text>
  <text start="770.31" dur="3.06">the bad behavior not that she&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="771.66" dur="3.99">role model though she would ignore the</text>
  <text start="773.37" dur="5.16">bad behavior because she loved them and</text>
  <text start="775.65" dur="7.11">in so doing she destroyed them she made</text>
  <text start="778.53" dur="7.11">them into what they are she she failed</text>
  <text start="782.76" dur="5.33">to instill any virtues at all and she</text>
  <text start="785.64" dur="4.59">enabled all of the bad behavior that</text>
  <text start="788.09" dur="5.35">continued into their adult life and are</text>
  <text start="790.23" dur="4.92">now part of who they are so now my</text>
  <text start="793.44" dur="3.24">brother he won&amp;#39;t hold a job he just</text>
  <text start="795.15" dur="5.21">finds girls to mooch off of because</text>
  <text start="796.68" dur="7.68">that&amp;#39;s what my mother taught him so as</text>
  <text start="800.36" dur="6.07">much of an individualist as I am we are</text>
  <text start="804.36" dur="5.94">a collective species we are herd animal</text>
  <text start="806.43" dur="8.1">species we are not an island no man is</text>
  <text start="810.3" dur="11.22">an island so to that extent we have to</text>
  <text start="814.53" dur="9.45">do some some sort of civil service - to</text>
  <text start="821.52" dur="6.17">the race to the species to the future to</text>
  <text start="823.98" dur="6.87">our to our next generations by trying to</text>
  <text start="827.69" dur="4.78">correct bad behavior just when we see it</text>
  <text start="830.85" dur="3.93">with a nudge here and a hint there and</text>
  <text start="832.47" dur="4.92">you know nonviolent approach that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="834.78" dur="6.65">I see social ostracism and shame as</text>
  <text start="837.39" dur="7.29">being the best approach okay</text>
  <text start="841.43" dur="5.68">the way it&amp;#39;ll eventually go if everybody</text>
  <text start="844.68" dur="3.12">started doing this some people would be</text>
  <text start="847.11" dur="2.82">saved</text>
  <text start="847.8" dur="3.87">okay the ones that have strong ties to</text>
  <text start="849.93" dur="3.69">moral people they would be brought back</text>
  <text start="851.67" dur="3.68">into the fold because they would not</text>
  <text start="853.62" dur="4.26">want to be kicked out of the fold and</text>
  <text start="855.35" dur="4.3">some people that that have no morals</text>
  <text start="857.88" dur="4.08">whatsoever would be well they would be</text>
  <text start="859.65" dur="4.2">pushed into their own group you would</text>
  <text start="861.96" dur="4.68">see the divide which is already kind of</text>
  <text start="863.85" dur="4.62">happening between moral and immoral kind</text>
  <text start="866.64" dur="4.32">of how you see conservative and liberal</text>
  <text start="868.47" dur="6">a little bit different but very similar</text>
  <text start="870.96" dur="6.17">overlaps and they would go together and</text>
  <text start="874.47" dur="5.43">they they would be destroyed just like</text>
  <text start="877.13" dur="5.26">Sodom and Gomorrah for example for the</text>
  <text start="879.9" dur="4.23">religious folks or any society that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="882.39" dur="4.62">faced them you know moral decay</text>
  <text start="884.13" dur="5.85">later-stage decadence they always end up</text>
  <text start="887.01" dur="4.41">imploding and they would implode whereas</text>
  <text start="889.98" dur="5.81">the people that have the morals would</text>
  <text start="891.42" dur="9.93">last longer and manage to to keep going</text>
  <text start="895.79" dur="7.18">so beyond that any problem that would</text>
  <text start="901.35" dur="3.39">come up since you&amp;#39;re not associating</text>
  <text start="902.97" dur="2.73">with those bad people any problem that</text>
  <text start="904.74" dur="2.94">would come up would be one of</text>
  <text start="905.7" dur="3.48">self-defense so if they attack you and</text>
  <text start="907.68" dur="2.7">like they&amp;#39;re starving because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="909.18" dur="2.13">figure out how to grow food because</text>
  <text start="910.38" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re too stupid they&amp;#39;re doing drugs</text>
  <text start="911.31" dur="3.86">all the time and they attack you you can</text>
  <text start="913.47" dur="4.86">just kill them completely moral</text>
  <text start="915.17" dur="5.169">self-defense that&amp;#39;s how problem would</text>
  <text start="918.33" dur="6.05">sort itself out all the way down the</text>
  <text start="920.339" dur="7.681">road if we don&amp;#39;t what will happen</text>
  <text start="924.38" dur="6.85">inevitably eventually is that the</text>
  <text start="928.02" dur="5.22">constant compromise compromise</text>
  <text start="931.23" dur="4.71">compromise compromise until we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="933.24" dur="8.76">as immoral as they are and everything is</text>
  <text start="935.94" dur="7.86">just you know moral decay so it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="942" dur="5.94">of that it&amp;#39;s kind of how the spiritual</text>
  <text start="943.8" dur="5.37">warfare works if you&amp;#39;re not you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="947.94" dur="2.73">gonna be able to do this by quoting</text>
  <text start="949.17" dur="3.51">scripture folks you&amp;#39;re not gonna be able</text>
  <text start="950.67" dur="4.05">to change the world for the better by</text>
  <text start="952.68" dur="7.29">talking about what Jesus said or or</text>
  <text start="954.72" dur="8.25">reading Bible verses or or being nice to</text>
  <text start="959.97" dur="6.48">people or turning the other cheek okay</text>
  <text start="962.97" dur="7.41">you you the only way to to really impact</text>
