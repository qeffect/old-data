  <text start="29.699" dur="4.29">up for them I&amp;#39;ve got the wire on the</text>
  <text start="31.71" dur="3.689">ground obviously for for digging out</text>

  <text start="178.98" dur="5.46">like facing myself so I&amp;#39;ve got a pallet</text>
  <text start="181.77" dur="4.77">up on rocks right now just kind of a way</text>
  <text start="184.44" dur="3.3">for them to go under and have babies and</text>
  <text start="186.54" dur="4.98">make little nests and stuff without</text>
  <text start="187.74" dur="6.03">digging these kind of giant holes that</text>
  <text start="191.52" dur="4.62">you&amp;#39;ll see thank you I fill them in with</text>
  <text start="193.77" dur="5.37">the rocks but you can kind of tell under</text>
  <text start="196.14" dur="4.68">they they&amp;#39;ve started to dig it&amp;#39;s love to</text>
  <text start="199.14" dur="4.8">dig there there are holes</text>
  <text start="200.82" dur="6.87">zavier it&amp;#39;s okay puppy and you can see</text>
  <text start="203.94" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;m gonna I mean I like you can kind of</text>
  <text start="207.69" dur="6.99">tell there&amp;#39;s a bunch of little ones</text>
  <text start="209.19" dur="8.88">under there and they&amp;#39;re happy guys they</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="6.33">are and these pallets are perfect</text>
  <text start="218.07" dur="7.02">because I can you know I can throw some</text>
  <text start="221.01" dur="6.18">grass on top of these pallets and they</text>
  <text start="225.09" dur="3.21">can in their own time and still feel</text>
  <text start="227.19" dur="3.6">really safe they can just poke their</text>
  <text start="228.3" dur="7.77">heads up and eat it it&amp;#39;s really nice for</text>
  <text start="230.79" dur="8.85">them yeah it&amp;#39;s not really too bad I</text>
  <text start="236.07" dur="5.1">built my own cages so it&amp;#39;s a lot cheaper</text>
  <text start="239.64" dur="2.849">that way and I feel like you get a lot</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="3.15">better deal than these some of these</text>
  <text start="242.489" dur="5.191">like Craigslist scrappy cages</text>
  <text start="244.32" dur="4.919">I used American steel galvanized after</text>
  <text start="247.68" dur="5.58">welding so it doesn&amp;#39;t rust at the joints</text>
  <text start="249.239" dur="5.25">I followed the directions of another</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="5.34">rabbit tree that&amp;#39;s like a professional</text>
  <text start="254.489" dur="7.711">camera of the name but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s nice if</text>
  <text start="258.6" dur="5.4">I remember it&amp;#39;s 14 gauge steel some of</text>
  <text start="262.2" dur="3.57">them you know I obviously put my my</text>
  <text start="264" dur="3.36">feeder boxes in there metal ones and I</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="2.82">got a mistake to chew</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="2.549">because rabbits need to chew or you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="268.59" dur="4.44">have to clip their teeth down and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.909" dur="5.16">enough fun I have these little breed</text>
  <text start="273.03" dur="4.379">boxes underneath built into the cage</text>
  <text start="275.069" dur="3.991">so rabbits instinct which is to kind of</text>
  <text start="277.409" dur="3.091">go underground well they just go down</text>
  <text start="279.06" dur="3.659">here and have their babies nests that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.5" dur="4.409">perfect and you know babies won&amp;#39;t hurt</text>
  <text start="282.719" dur="3.991">their legs up here on the on the metal</text>
  <text start="284.909" dur="6.111">at first they can be injured you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="286.71" dur="6.57">careful it&amp;#39;s a bit of a mess right now I</text>
  <text start="291.02" dur="4.179">was waiting until the outdoor area got</text>
  <text start="293.28" dur="4.949">got finished so that I could start</text>
  <text start="295.199" dur="6.571">scraping up and cleaning but yeah I mean</text>
  <text start="298.229" dur="5.34">right now it&amp;#39;s it is uh it is still it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="3.48">very effective I mean they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="303.569" dur="4.921">great life they are getting all the</text>
  <text start="305.25" dur="4.59">nutrition of the grass and stuff I you</text>
  <text start="308.49" dur="3.179">know I have all these crock pots full of</text>
  <text start="309.84" dur="3.15">food and water for them but a lot of</text>
  <text start="311.669" dur="4.891">that they just get from the grasses and</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="6.51">stuff now I add iodine to the water a</text>
  <text start="316.56" dur="4.65">little bit for for their health for my</text>
  <text start="319.5" dur="5.52">health and for my dog&amp;#39;s health so we can</text>
  <text start="321.21" dur="6.179">get some iodine in our diet and I and</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="3.78">also for disinfecting the water</text>
  <text start="327.389" dur="5">sometimes they poop in their water you</text>
  <text start="328.8" dur="7.589">know that&amp;#39;s as part of animals sometimes</text>
  <text start="332.389" dur="7.171">let&amp;#39;s see did I cover everything I&amp;#39;m I</text>
  <text start="336.389" dur="5.37">feed them pellets but at the same point</text>
  <text start="339.56" dur="3.789">they kind of pick and choose what they</text>
  <text start="341.759" dur="2.97">want so sometimes they prefer the grass</text>
  <text start="343.349" dur="3.06">and that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="344.729" dur="5.101">they get their water and food mostly</text>
  <text start="346.409" dur="4.62">from the grass I think that&amp;#39;s all of it</text>
  <text start="349.83" dur="2.459">I&amp;#39;ve got I&amp;#39;ve got a number of these</text>
  <text start="351.029" dur="5.73">cages this is my favorite cuz it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="352.289" dur="6.481">labeled about 15 feet long it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="356.759" dur="3.601">five cage setup which is really nice if</text>
  <text start="358.77" dur="3.239">you have the space to do that cuz it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="3.39">lot easier to build one of those these</text>
  <text start="362.009" dur="3.21">things can go together really quickly by</text>
  <text start="363.75" dur="3.3">the way if you mean the cutting sucks</text>
  <text start="365.219" dur="3.63">unless you have a like a really nice</text>
  <text start="367.05" dur="4.049">tool for cutting the metal you&amp;#39;ll wear</text>
  <text start="368.849" dur="6.451">your hands out on that part but really</text>
  <text start="371.099" dur="6.211">nice I like these kind of just push in</text>
  <text start="375.3" dur="6.06">and fall down doors these are really</text>
  <text start="377.31" dur="5.34">neat you know III did my homework before</text>
  <text start="381.36" dur="4.619">I built these cages so I got all the</text>
  <text start="382.65" dur="6.18">nice features the appropriate space for</text>
  <text start="385.979" dur="3.87">an adult rabbit you may make it a little</text>
  <text start="388.83" dur="7.649">larger if you&amp;#39;re gonna leave them in</text>

  <text start="408.66" dur="2.73">like to let kids come play over here</text>
