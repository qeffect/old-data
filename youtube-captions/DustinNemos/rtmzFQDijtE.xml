  <text start="15.839" dur="3.901">hours a day and I don&amp;#39;t know why I</text>
  <text start="17.64" dur="4.82">didn&amp;#39;t just move in here I have a super</text>
  <text start="19.74" dur="5.1">long internet cord soon hey why not</text>
  <text start="22.46" dur="3.76">there is a lot of different things I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="24.84" dur="2.939">going to run through as quickly as I can</text>
  <text start="26.22" dur="4.74">and there was some queueing on at the</text>
  <text start="27.779" dur="5.611">end of this so let&amp;#39;s just jump right in</text>
  <text start="30.96" dur="4.5">first there&amp;#39;s the politics okay we have</text>
  <text start="33.39" dur="4.95">the Trump administration working to set</text>
  <text start="35.46" dur="4.83">up a kind of an Arab NATO to oppose Iran</text>
  <text start="38.34" dur="3">that&amp;#39;s interesting and exciting there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="40.29" dur="2.81">a lot of those little countries and</text>
  <text start="41.34" dur="4.379">together they may form some sort of</text>
  <text start="43.1" dur="4.72">actual like unit that could get some</text>
  <text start="45.719" dur="4.741">stuff done so that&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="47.82" dur="5.879">he&amp;#39;s kind of using the Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="50.46" dur="4.71">Arab States again to solve the problem</text>
  <text start="53.699" dur="3.45">of the Middle Eastern Arab states you</text>
  <text start="55.17" dur="4.139">know let them deal with it because you</text>
  <text start="57.149" dur="3.93">know historically traditionally that is</text>
  <text start="59.309" dur="3">where empires go to die you know you</text>
  <text start="61.079" dur="6.301">don&amp;#39;t really want to be in the Middle</text>
  <text start="62.309" dur="10.221">East it&amp;#39;s kind of a a a headache to put</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="7.559">it lightly a swamp a nightmare a</text>
  <text start="72.53" dur="4.089">disaster scenario I mean it&amp;#39;s not a good</text>
  <text start="74.939" dur="4.141">place to try to control it&amp;#39;s not a good</text>
  <text start="76.619" dur="3.721">place to try to to try to rule it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="79.08" dur="3.75">better to let them deal with their own</text>
  <text start="80.34" dur="3.569">problems and just get away from it and</text>
  <text start="82.83" dur="3.45">that seems to be what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="83.909" dur="6.091">he&amp;#39;s just pulling back every chance he</text>
  <text start="86.28" dur="4.62">gets like he&amp;#39;s letting other people you</text>
  <text start="90" dur="3.39">know he&amp;#39;s kind of moving toward other</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="4.35">people controlling Syria and and and</text>
  <text start="93.39" dur="4.17">policing that area and everything else</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="3.21">just pull the troops home quit wasting</text>
  <text start="97.56" dur="3.69">so much money</text>
  <text start="98.46" dur="4.89">quit playing you know head police of the</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="5.07">world which we have absolutely no right</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="5.339">to do at all and we just cause more</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="5.18">problems an example being you know you</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="5.311">killed Gadhafi now we have millions of</text>
  <text start="111.5" dur="4.81">Muslims flooding the world an example</text>
  <text start="114" dur="4.89">being you try to help African children</text>
  <text start="116.31" dur="4.349">who are starving boom now you fed them</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="3.329">and now they&amp;#39;ve reproduced three times</text>
  <text start="120.659" dur="3.361">as many and now you have three times as</text>
  <text start="122.219" dur="3.991">many African children starving because</text>
  <text start="124.02" dur="4.409">you did not solve the root cause you</text>
  <text start="126.21" dur="5.16">gave them food you didn&amp;#39;t teach them to</text>
  <text start="128.429" dur="5.071">grow food you gave them fish you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="131.37" dur="3.69">teach them to raise the or catch their</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="4.11">fish or to grow their own fish or</text>
  <text start="135.06" dur="3.81">whatever in today&amp;#39;s terms so when you do</text>
  <text start="137.61" dur="3.12">this you don&amp;#39;t solve the root cause a</text>
  <text start="138.87" dur="4.71">problem you just exacerbate the problem</text>
  <text start="140.73" dur="4.95">and in fact the same people who fed the</text>
  <text start="143.58" dur="4.11">starving children I don&amp;#39;t know 20 30</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="5.1">years ago or whatever are now to blame</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="5.31">for you know the larger quantities of</text>
  <text start="150.78" dur="4.92">starving children like it they directly</text>
  <text start="153" dur="5.73">cost this they fed the animals at the</text>
  <text start="155.7" dur="4.92">zoo and you know and ruin the animals so</text>
  <text start="158.73" dur="3.3">to speak and that&amp;#39;s kind of why they</text>
  <text start="160.62" dur="2.85">tell you don&amp;#39;t feed the Bears they will</text>
  <text start="162.03" dur="2.85">become dependent don&amp;#39;t feed the animals</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="3.06">of the zoo they will become dependent</text>
  <text start="164.88" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t feed the wild animals they will</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="5.19">become dependent but feed the starving</text>
  <text start="168.81" dur="4.92">third world errs because whatever right</text>
  <text start="171.72" dur="3.36">because of emotions now I&amp;#39;m a very</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="3.78">empathetic person and very sympathetic</text>
  <text start="175.08" dur="4.08">to the situation no one will looks at</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="4.59">those pictures of those kids starving</text>
  <text start="179.16" dur="6.84">and does not feel sympathy but how we</text>
  <text start="182.1" dur="5.67">get there is not often necessarily the</text>
  <text start="186" dur="3.27">feel-good approach sometimes you got to</text>
  <text start="187.77" dur="3.3">do what works not what feels good right</text>
  <text start="189.27" dur="4.77">you have to take the hard decision</text>
  <text start="191.07" dur="4.92">sometimes and that is not exacerbating</text>
  <text start="194.04" dur="4.86">the problem by like just kicking the can</text>
  <text start="195.99" dur="4.38">down the road which is politicians they</text>
  <text start="198.9" dur="2.79">love to do this why not because they</text>
  <text start="200.37" dur="2.52">won&amp;#39;t have to pay the consequences they</text>
  <text start="201.69" dur="2.549">don&amp;#39;t care about the consequences</text>
  <text start="202.89" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re insulated from all the decisions</text>
  <text start="204.239" dur="4.051">they make because they&amp;#39;re so wealthy via</text>
  <text start="206.4" dur="3.93">corruption so what do they care right</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="4.41">they just marked us off a cliff man who</text>
  <text start="210.33" dur="6.18">cares for them it&amp;#39;s at most an</text>
  <text start="212.7" dur="6.66">intellectual exercise and at worst it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.51" dur="5.61">really just more you know ruling the</text>
  <text start="219.36" dur="4.909">world and being evil in many cases you</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="4.86">know corruption that kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="224.269" dur="4.061">selling out to make profit you know</text>
  <text start="226.98" dur="2.91">selling out the people look at the big</text>
  <text start="228.33" dur="6.51">pharma companies is murdering us from</text>
  <text start="229.89" dur="7.74">for-profit Italy strangely backs brexit</text>
  <text start="234.84" dur="4.41">so salvini actually came out and accuses</text>
  <text start="237.63" dur="4.41">the EU of swindling he&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="5.01">saying like yeah my experience with the</text>
  <text start="242.04" dur="3.99">EU if you don&amp;#39;t hold your own they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.26" dur="4.05">gonna swindle you right and he&amp;#39;s backing</text>
  <text start="246.03" dur="4.11">brexit and and kind of Trump as well so</text>
  <text start="248.31" dur="3.3">he&amp;#39;s this is very interesting brexit for</text>
  <text start="250.14" dur="3.87">those who aren&amp;#39;t followings kind of like</text>
  <text start="251.61" dur="4.379">the UK&amp;#39;s Trump but without the actual</text>
  <text start="254.01" dur="4.68">person it&amp;#39;s sort of their referendum on</text>
  <text start="255.989" dur="5.851">evil and corruption and and the invasion</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="5.789">of immigrants into their culture but</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="3.5">it&amp;#39;s doing badly because obviously they</text>
  <text start="264.479" dur="2.811">don&amp;#39;t have Trump</text>
  <text start="265.34" dur="3.24">ahead to try to move this thing they</text>
  <text start="267.29" dur="4.95">have Nigel Faraj but he doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="268.58" dur="5.61">that political power so you know Breck&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="272.24" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s in danger and i it&amp;#39;s good to see</text>
  <text start="274.19" dur="3.66">other countries now backing it because</text>
  <text start="275.84" dur="3.48">honestly the EU only can be here in ten</text>
  <text start="277.85" dur="4.73">more years anyway at least not in its</text>
  <text start="279.32" dur="6.12">current state speaking of the UK</text>
  <text start="282.58" dur="4.96">journalist from the UK robert fisk says</text>

  <text start="289.61" dur="5.67">okay in the US and other places in the</text>
  <text start="291.8" dur="5.67">west so this guy&amp;#39;s is tracing like the</text>
  <text start="295.28" dur="4.949">words on the side of the of the used</text>
  <text start="297.47" dur="4.41">bomb shell casings to the companies and</text>
  <text start="300.229" dur="2.881">he&amp;#39;s showing up he&amp;#39;s asking hey why are</text>
  <text start="301.88" dur="2.28">these why are these showing up the</text>
  <text start="303.11" dur="3.39">terrorist sites like how did the</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="4.05">terrorists buy these from you and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.5" dur="2.88">that&amp;#39;s hopefully he won&amp;#39;t get killed</text>
  <text start="308.21" dur="4.709">that&amp;#39;s the kind of thing that you get</text>
  <text start="309.38" dur="6.87">killed doing furled keep an eye on it</text>
  <text start="312.919" dur="6.631">Assange is fate is now being basically</text>
  <text start="316.25" dur="5.669">decided or you know brokered or bartered</text>
  <text start="319.55" dur="4.32">on by greedy politicians in ecuador the</text>
  <text start="321.919" dur="3.87">the new president there you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.87" dur="3.72">called him a stone in the shoe and kind</text>
  <text start="325.789" dur="3.63">of someone else&amp;#39;s headache and all of</text>
  <text start="327.59" dur="3.84">these things and he just he wants to get</text>
  <text start="329.419" dur="3.691">rid of it and he wants also to get some</text>
  <text start="331.43" dur="4.799">sort of Perkin and just basically</text>
  <text start="333.11" dur="6.33">negotiate the sell of julian assange to</text>
  <text start="336.229" dur="4.921">the UK or cross possibly the u.s. this</text>
  <text start="339.44" dur="3.96">is terrible especially since Assange is</text>
  <text start="341.15" dur="4.5">now an Ecuadorian citizen so I guess</text>
  <text start="343.4" dur="4.47">that doesn&amp;#39;t mean much in today&amp;#39;s world</text>
  <text start="345.65" dur="3.78">with that particular president I kind of</text>
  <text start="347.87" dur="4.859">miss the old guy he really seemed to</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="4.98">have a thing against the Western powers</text>
  <text start="352.729" dur="4.401">and he kind of stood his ground for</text>
  <text start="354.41" dur="5.52">Assange and and it&amp;#39;s sad to see him gone</text>
  <text start="357.13" dur="4.99">now president Trump fires a shot at</text>
  <text start="359.93" dur="6.209">Democrats okay the GOP leaders are</text>
  <text start="362.12" dur="4.89">willing to shut down the government if</text>
  <text start="366.139" dur="2.941">they don&amp;#39;t get there</text>
  <text start="367.01" dur="3.48">their border wall funding now remember</text>
  <text start="369.08" dur="3.209">we talked a while like he has all of</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="3.39">this potential funding he could use from</text>
  <text start="372.289" dur="3.931">that big military budget that he could</text>
  <text start="373.88" dur="6.15">use to just find the wall but at the</text>
  <text start="376.22" dur="5.61">same point using this as a leverage</text>
  <text start="380.03" dur="3.389">point to shut down the government could</text>
  <text start="381.83" dur="3.899">be just what Trump wants I mean he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.419" dur="5.521">really trying to push his seems to</text>
  <text start="385.729" dur="5.341">shrink government to lower the the</text>
  <text start="388.94" dur="4.469">actual expense operating costs of such a</text>
  <text start="391.07" dur="6.149">large bureaucracy rewriting nightmare</text>
  <text start="393.409" dur="5.031">and this would be a good way just blame</text>
  <text start="397.219" dur="2.721">it on the Democrats</text>
  <text start="398.44" dur="2.49">I&amp;#39;m an get shut down you know the kind</text>
  <text start="399.94" dur="2.55">of games are gonna play they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="400.93" dur="2.91">close down like all the public parks</text>
  <text start="402.49" dur="2.97">that don&amp;#39;t really require a lot of</text>
  <text start="403.84" dur="3.57">funding to keep them open anyway they</text>
  <text start="405.46" dur="4.04">they just shut the gate and it&amp;#39;s costing</text>
  <text start="407.41" dur="4.56">them the same they&amp;#39;re not firing anybody</text>
  <text start="409.5" dur="4.27">they try to like me they&amp;#39;ve done this</text>
  <text start="411.97" dur="3.21">before they made it inconvenient for</text>
  <text start="413.77" dur="3.15">people and they try to take away all the</text>
  <text start="415.18" dur="3.15">easy things that they give you to sort</text>
  <text start="416.92" dur="3.09">of make you think that the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="418.33" dur="3.63">helping you out like public parks and</text>
  <text start="420.01" dur="3.93">things like that which are terrible and</text>
  <text start="421.96" dur="4.44">trashy in most cases anyway so really</text>
  <text start="423.94" dur="4.05">private parks are far better but you</text>
  <text start="426.4" dur="3.66">know that they try to play these kind of</text>
  <text start="427.99" dur="5.01">games like you need us or else you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="430.06" dur="7.11">lose your access to the parks okay well</text>
  <text start="433" dur="7.32">I personally don&amp;#39;t care right I&amp;#39;ll go in</text>
  <text start="437.17" dur="4.8">the backyard before I bend and take it</text>
  <text start="440.32" dur="3.08">because they shut down the parks like I</text>
  <text start="441.97" dur="3.81">want them to shut down the government</text>
  <text start="443.4" dur="4.57">can&amp;#39;t happen soon enough and the fact</text>
  <text start="445.78" dur="4.11">that Trump could do it and then blame</text>
  <text start="447.97" dur="3.96">them for it could give him just what he</text>
  <text start="449.89" dur="3.3">needs to kind of shrink that government</text>
  <text start="451.93" dur="4.59">in the long term because people would</text>
  <text start="453.19" dur="6.32">just get used to it after about a month</text>
  <text start="456.52" dur="5.19">or two of things being shut down and and</text>
  <text start="459.51" dur="3.55">not a big deals not the end of the world</text>
  <text start="461.71" dur="2.73">now we can just lists to save all this</text>
  <text start="463.06" dur="3">money and then Trump will be like look</text>
  <text start="464.44" dur="3.15">hey by the way we can save this much</text>
  <text start="466.06" dur="3.33">more and to give it to you in taxes</text>
  <text start="467.59" dur="5.67">people are gonna he&amp;#39;s gonna bribe people</text>
  <text start="469.39" dur="6.18">maybe so this is all speculation at this</text>
  <text start="473.26" dur="3.78">point but it does seem the trends you</text>
  <text start="475.57" dur="3.39">know he&amp;#39;s lowering taxes he&amp;#39;s cutting</text>
  <text start="477.04" dur="3.39">regulations he respects Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="478.96" dur="3.27">he&amp;#39;s kind of going after the banks and</text>
  <text start="480.43" dur="3.72">corruption in general and he&amp;#39;s helping</text>
  <text start="482.23" dur="3.87">us out even at his own personal expense</text>
  <text start="484.15" dur="4.11">because as a song to tweeted out before</text>
  <text start="486.1" dur="4.47">he was in prison and Trump has lost like</text>
  <text start="488.26" dur="5.45">a quarter of his of his wealth fighting</text>
  <text start="490.57" dur="5.79">for us doing this okay he&amp;#39;s losing money</text>
  <text start="493.71" dur="5.95">doing this substantial chunk of his</text>
  <text start="496.36" dur="8.43">wealth to do this for us okay that has</text>
  <text start="499.66" dur="9.6">to be said often anyway so it does seem</text>
  <text start="504.79" dur="5.67">that he has the the understanding to get</text>
  <text start="509.26" dur="2.58">to that point get rid of the Federal</text>
  <text start="510.46" dur="3.75">Reserve or shrink the government or</text>
  <text start="511.84" dur="3.9">whatever very introduction like and he</text>
  <text start="514.21" dur="4.98">does seem to have that sort of goal in</text>
  <text start="515.74" dur="9.27">mind to just give power back to the</text>
  <text start="519.19" dur="7.649">people now continuing on Devin Nunez has</text>
  <text start="525.01" dur="3.6">a boom he is saying that we are looking</text>
  <text start="526.839" dur="3.941">at legal remedies to deal with Twitter</text>
  <text start="528.61" dur="3.97">censoring conservatives</text>
  <text start="530.78" dur="3.09">boom I mean that is a huge deal</text>
  <text start="532.58" dur="3.3">especially right after all this other</text>

  <text start="699.2" dur="5.64">MMS to give people a quick example it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="702.56" dur="3.84">a very cheap weaker version of hydrogen</text>
  <text start="704.84" dur="3.6">peroxide basically it&amp;#39;s similar to a</text>

  <text start="708.44" dur="3.57">tried to outlaw it there&amp;#39;s a church</text>

  <text start="713.54" dur="4.02">and they have done amazing things with</text>
  <text start="716.51" dur="3.18">the stuff there&amp;#39;s the documentary out</text>
  <text start="717.56" dur="3.84">about it called quantum leap at one</text>
  <text start="719.69" dur="3.42">point the Red Cross like the lower-level</text>
  <text start="721.4" dur="4.17">good people that actually like show up</text>
  <text start="723.11" dur="4.35">and donate their time to help they cured</text>
  <text start="725.57" dur="3.72">like 150 cases of malaria now to be</text>
  <text start="727.46" dur="3.41">clear mosquitoes are like the second</text>

  <text start="730.87" dur="4.3">third-world countries often with things</text>
  <text start="733.22" dur="4.8">like malaria so for this stuff to just</text>
  <text start="735.17" dur="5.52">cheaply like a couple drops a day cure</text>
  <text start="738.02" dur="4.86">malaria I&amp;#39;m not making claim some</text>
  <text start="740.69" dur="5.1">medical claims or anything this is just</text>
  <text start="742.88" dur="5.52">from what we&amp;#39;ve seen 150k 156 I think</text>
  <text start="745.79" dur="3.87">cases the Red Cross did this and then</text>
  <text start="748.4" dur="2.52">the higher-ups at the Red Cross found</text>
  <text start="749.66" dur="2.61">out about it and they covered the whole</text>
  <text start="750.92" dur="2.88">thing out pretended it never happened</text>
  <text start="752.27" dur="4.04">even though the interviews and</text>
  <text start="753.8" dur="4.92">everything you&amp;#39;re still out there so</text>
  <text start="756.31" dur="4.15">this is a very interesting one of those</text>
  <text start="758.72" dur="3.15">things is so cheap no one will ever</text>
  <text start="760.46" dur="2.49">bother to turn it into some sort of</text>
  <text start="761.87" dur="3.81">patented medicine anything like that</text>
  <text start="762.95" dur="5.04">basically like hydrogen peroxide in fact</text>
  <text start="765.68" dur="3.96">the way it works and I didn&amp;#39;t even mean</text>
  <text start="767.99" dur="3.24">to get into a health spiel the way it</text>
  <text start="769.64" dur="4.56">works is a much like hydrogen peroxide</text>
  <text start="771.23" dur="4.95">it just sort of oxidizes things using</text>
  <text start="774.2" dur="4.95">that extra oxygen molecule in hydrogen</text>
  <text start="776.18" dur="5.61">peroxide which is h2o to instead of like</text>
  <text start="779.15" dur="4.65">water h2o has an extra oxygen molecule</text>
  <text start="781.79" dur="3.84">it just quarter oxidizes you know</text>
  <text start="783.8" dur="3.84">exercises everything inside and kind of</text>
  <text start="785.63" dur="4.77">scrubs and cleans and it&amp;#39;s bad for the</text>
  <text start="787.64" dur="4.17">bad stuff and it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="790.4" dur="3.42">little bit rougher on the good stuff</text>
  <text start="791.81" dur="3.81">when you&amp;#39;re doing doing hydrogen</text>
  <text start="793.82" dur="3.75">peroxide if you&amp;#39;ve ever drank like food</text>
  <text start="795.62" dur="3.6">grade hydrogen peroxide you put like one</text>
  <text start="797.57" dur="3.329">in a glass of water and burns your</text>
  <text start="799.22" dur="2.46">throat going down it&amp;#39;s good for you but</text>
  <text start="800.899" dur="2.911">it&amp;#39;s not fun</text>
  <text start="801.68" dur="4.5">you really have to dilute it and it goes</text>
  <text start="803.81" dur="4.139">a long way and it expires fairly quickly</text>
  <text start="806.18" dur="3.029">and that&amp;#39;s kind of a bad thing but you</text>
  <text start="807.949" dur="3.271">know you can use that for animals and</text>
  <text start="809.209" dur="3.93">and livestock and everything else it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="811.22" dur="5.669">really good for pets it&amp;#39;s just more</text>
  <text start="813.139" dur="5.911">oxygen but this stuff works a little bit</text>
  <text start="816.889" dur="3.721">weaker and therefore far more tolerable</text>
  <text start="819.05" dur="4.14">and just basically you just kind of</text>
  <text start="820.61" dur="5.49">build up a saturation and just kind of</text>
  <text start="823.19" dur="5.879">keep increasing like slowly shocks</text>
  <text start="826.1" dur="6.45">Thunder and then you have this this</text>
  <text start="829.069" dur="5.82">slightly increasing level of toxicity</text>
  <text start="832.55" dur="3.779">and hostility to all the bad stuff in</text>
  <text start="834.889" dur="3.661">your body and this stuff just kind of</text>
  <text start="836.329" dur="4.651">slowly just eats it away with the</text>
  <text start="838.55" dur="4.05">oxidizing and can kill you know bacteria</text>
  <text start="840.98" dur="3.779">it can kill the parasites in some cases</text>
  <text start="842.6" dur="3.659">I mean they talked about some some</text>
  <text start="844.759" dur="2.7">pretty raunchy stuff coming out of your</text>
  <text start="846.259" dur="2.52">body when you take some of this stuff</text>
  <text start="847.459" dur="3.901">you know long-term and you&amp;#39;ve really</text>
  <text start="848.779" dur="3.901">moved up the protocols so I&amp;#39;m starting</text>
  <text start="851.36" dur="2.49">out this is just my first thing the</text>
  <text start="852.68" dur="2.969">research I&amp;#39;ve done is very interesting</text>
  <text start="853.85" dur="6.9">it&amp;#39;s kind of another one of those like</text>
  <text start="855.649" dur="6.361">c60 style big game-changer style</text>
  <text start="860.75" dur="2.699">products I mean there&amp;#39;s a lot of things</text>
  <text start="862.01" dur="1.74">out there they&amp;#39;re very powerful for your</text>
  <text start="863.449" dur="3.271">health</text>
  <text start="863.75" dur="5.01">few things are these are as powerful as</text>
  <text start="866.72" dur="3.54">these products for four pennies a day so</text>
  <text start="868.76" dur="3.54">this is the kind of stuff that you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="870.26" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll hear about occasionally on</text>
  <text start="872.3" dur="3.269">my channel when I get him to the old</text>
  <text start="873.86" dur="5.849">media and or the old health and things</text>
  <text start="875.569" dur="6.57">like that moving back to the news mana</text>
  <text start="879.709" dur="3.901">force readying for his trial on Tuesday</text>
  <text start="882.139" dur="2.731">he could be facing like life in prison</text>

  <text start="884.87" dur="4.5">Podesta who conveniently signed up for</text>
  <text start="887.6" dur="5.789">being a foreign agent after the fact</text>
  <text start="889.37" dur="5.61">right before Podesta basically got out</text>
  <text start="893.389" dur="3.93">of this and then manna fort was going to</text>
  <text start="894.98" dur="5.339">jail for it possibly so there is also</text>
  <text start="897.319" dur="4.07">that America and Trump is constantly</text>
  <text start="900.319" dur="3.421">calling that out by the way just</text>
  <text start="901.389" dur="3.82">especially recently like why are you</text>
  <text start="903.74" dur="6.089">focusing on the Podesta stuff what&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="905.209" dur="6.661">what&amp;#39;s up and I think it was Nunez that</text>
  <text start="909.829" dur="4.32">said the American public will be shocked</text>
  <text start="911.87" dur="4.56">at the redacted portions of the Carter</text>
  <text start="914.149" dur="3.63">page visa application so this might be</text>
  <text start="916.43" dur="3.12">that stuff where they were talking about</text>
  <text start="917.779" dur="4.831">killing a president as a back-up plan or</text>
  <text start="919.55" dur="5.13">secret societies or whatever Jim Jordan</text>

  <text start="929.12" dur="2.77">a director I mean</text>
  <text start="930.18" dur="3.33">you don&amp;#39;t make statements like this and</text>
  <text start="931.89" dur="2.97">then back down from that in public</text>
  <text start="933.51" dur="2.55">you&amp;#39;ll be considered a coward and weak</text>
  <text start="934.86" dur="3.78">and no one will ever take you seriously</text>
  <text start="936.06" dur="5.31">again when Trump says things like I will</text>
  <text start="938.64" dur="5.1">let the government be shut down he means</text>
  <text start="941.37" dur="3.9">it okay and really what that means</text>
  <text start="943.74" dur="2.82">effectively they may try to take it a</text>
  <text start="945.27" dur="2.85">little further this time to try to like</text>
  <text start="946.56" dur="3.39">fight Trump and make it hard on the</text>
  <text start="948.12" dur="4.29">people but really what that means</text>
  <text start="949.95" dur="5.28">effectively is a lot of that useless</text>
  <text start="952.41" dur="3.989">spending is gonna get shut down some</text>
  <text start="955.23" dur="2.22">people in the government are gonna have</text>

  <text start="965.91" dur="3.78">get their paycheck although all of that</text>
  <text start="967.98" dur="3.51">money is stolen from us in taxes so</text>
  <text start="969.69" dur="3.78">there is some argument to be made there</text>
  <text start="971.49" dur="4.8">but there are good people in government</text>
  <text start="973.47" dur="4.53">and we will still need to find some way</text>
  <text start="976.29" dur="4.59">to fund those people as we hopefully</text>
  <text start="978" dur="4.23">shrink the government but I have I have</text>

  <text start="3201.87" dur="3.45">have even heard about that until I</text>
  <text start="3203.31" dur="3.36">started mentioning it because it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="3205.32" dur="2.88">new and there&amp;#39;s only a few people out</text>
  <text start="3206.67" dur="2.92">there even talking about it and at the</text>
  <text start="3208.2" dur="2.89">same point</text>

  <text start="3211.09" dur="4.02">double your life possibly I would really</text>
  <text start="3213.1" dur="3.24">like as part of the the things that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3215.11" dur="3.21">going to do in the future one of the</text>
  <text start="3216.34" dur="5.07">projects I&amp;#39;d like to behind me on my</text>
  <text start="3218.32" dur="6.84">bookshelf somewhere make a section for</text>
  <text start="3221.41" dur="6.9">two small rat cages and do a c60 and</text>
  <text start="3225.16" dur="5.43">then a non c60 oil same oil you know</text>
  <text start="3228.31" dur="3.69">coconut or olive oil or whatever I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="3230.59" dur="2.64">like to actually do coconut if possible</text>
  <text start="3232" dur="3.66">because olive oil we&amp;#39;ve already had</text>
  <text start="3233.23" dur="4.47">those studies right but I would like to</text>
  <text start="3235.66" dur="3.54">show you guys like seeing is believing</text>
  <text start="3237.7" dur="2.94">so I&amp;#39;d like to show you guys in the</text>
  <text start="3239.2" dur="3.54">background over the course of a year or</text>
  <text start="3240.64" dur="3.87">two which I think some of their asks can</text>
  <text start="3242.74" dur="3.72">only have a lifespan of of a year so you</text>
  <text start="3244.51" dur="3.48">can get the ones that are shorter they</text>
  <text start="3246.46" dur="3.9">breed them like to be consistently</text>
  <text start="3247.99" dur="4.98">perfect genetic went twins basically for</text>
  <text start="3250.36" dur="4.47">lab studies so if I get a couple of</text>
  <text start="3252.97" dur="4.02">those like I think they&amp;#39;re like 30 $40</text>
  <text start="3254.83" dur="3.63">lab mice but if I could get a couple of</text>
  <text start="3256.99" dur="2.73">those and like a small setup I would</text>
  <text start="3258.46" dur="4.41">love to do that for you guys and you can</text>
  <text start="3259.72" dur="5.52">see for yourself over the course of like</text>
  <text start="3262.87" dur="4.5">a year or two or just you know a</text>
  <text start="3265.24" dur="4.86">compilation video or something exactly</text>
  <text start="3267.37" dur="4.08">what c60 does to these rats which are</text>
  <text start="3270.1" dur="5.01">very genetically close to us</text>
  <text start="3271.45" dur="5.28">that&amp;#39;s something I want to do MMS is is</text>
  <text start="3275.11" dur="4.05">something I could possibly be interested</text>
  <text start="3276.73" dur="4.17">in setting up a similar or study for I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3279.16" dur="3.87">not ever probably gonna sell MMS because</text>
  <text start="3280.9" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s incredibly cheap to buy I think</text>
  <text start="3283.03" dur="3.63">twenty thirty dollars for your supply</text>
  <text start="3284.32" dur="5.22">there&amp;#39;s really no you know there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="3286.66" dur="4.89">point to trying to sell it as a profit</text>
  <text start="3289.54" dur="3.18">item and there are some great products</text>
  <text start="3291.55" dur="3.93">out there that you guys can get already</text>

  <text start="3295.48" dur="5.22">convenience but I doubt I get into it</text>
  <text start="3297.19" dur="4.62">too much just like iodine there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="3300.7" dur="3.81">point selling that you can make it</text>
  <text start="3301.81" dur="4.77">yourself so cheaply magnesium like it</text>
  <text start="3304.51" dur="3.93">would be dishonest if they sell you my</text>
  <text start="3306.58" dur="4.41">museum because you can make it so</text>
  <text start="3308.44" dur="3.75">cheaply yourself and these these kind of</text>
