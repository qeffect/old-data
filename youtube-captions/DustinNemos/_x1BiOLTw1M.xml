  <text start="323.85" dur="3.36">up and killed my daughter yeah there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="325.77" dur="5.42">culture of these people they dream about</text>
  <text start="327.21" dur="3.98">these things they talk about Columbine</text>
  <text start="334.34" dur="6.04">you know I&amp;#39;m saying put them in programs</text>

  <text start="356.76" dur="4.11">who knows what to get them in that sort</text>
  <text start="358.83" dur="3.75">of a mindset in the first place without</text>
  <text start="360.87" dur="4.29">having to expose other children to</text>
  <text start="362.58" dur="4.14">danger I mean this is sort of a I would</text>
  <text start="365.16" dur="3.3">blame I would just blame it on a public</text>
  <text start="366.72" dur="3.87">school problem because they just seem to</text>
  <text start="368.46" dur="4.86">always mess up the education system but</text>
  <text start="370.59" dur="6.12">you know what would you say why do you</text>
  <text start="373.32" dur="5.7">think Democrats are so on this issue the</text>
  <text start="376.71" dur="9.72">wrong side I mean they&amp;#39;re always so</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="8.58">antagonizing to take in really the facts</text>
