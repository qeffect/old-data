  <text start="27.06" dur="5.429">into whether the FBI investigation was</text>
  <text start="29.58" dur="4.92">corrupted by political influence in</text>
  <text start="32.489" dur="2.581">their determination of the Clinton</text>
  <text start="34.5" dur="2.67">outcome</text>
  <text start="35.07" dur="4.62">now remember many of these people have</text>
  <text start="37.17" dur="6.6">already been fired or demoted or some</text>
  <text start="39.69" dur="7.38">cases demoted twice it&amp;#39;s looking pretty</text>

  <text start="75.75" dur="3.509">the things that I hate most about this</text>
  <text start="77.13" dur="5.04">cultural war stuff is the constant left</text>
  <text start="79.259" dur="5.491">lies that they make up like every single</text>

  <text start="93" dur="6.32">deal and it&amp;#39;s just a smear campaign you</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="6.361">know and seeing that kind of thing</text>
  <text start="99.32" dur="6.07">actually have an impact on the world</text>
  <text start="102.09" dur="4.919">actually work for some people a large</text>
  <text start="105.39" dur="6.06">minority of people a bunch of stupid</text>
  <text start="107.009" dur="6.691">people seeing that happen is such a</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="4.529">frustration and seeing something like</text>
  <text start="113.7" dur="6.48">this which is gonna cost or McDaniels</text>
  <text start="115.979" dur="7.381">a lot of money is a beautiful thing just</text>
  <text start="120.18" dur="5.549">as a personal note I and it sets a great</text>
  <text start="123.36" dur="4.289">precedent it sets a good example if you</text>
  <text start="125.729" dur="5.2">keep this fake stuff up we&amp;#39;re gonna just</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="5.021">see you and take money from you so</text>
  <text start="130.929" dur="6.42">you know she&amp;#39;s basically been milking</text>
  <text start="132.67" dur="6.239">you know this somewhat connection to</text>
  <text start="137.349" dur="4.59">Tromp not even really a good connection</text>
  <text start="138.909" dur="4.231">to Trump to try to accuse him of stuff</text>
  <text start="141.939" dur="3.33">that he never did even though I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="143.14" dur="4.469">showed the quote where she on Facebook</text>
  <text start="145.269" dur="3.39">to a friend admitted that she never did</text>
  <text start="147.609" dur="5.011">anything with him and things like that</text>
  <text start="148.659" dur="7.47">so I think it&amp;#39;s wonderful I hope he gets</text>
  <text start="152.62" dur="11.459">a billion dollars out of her out of her</text>
  <text start="156.129" dur="9.45">lying famed whoring self and you know</text>
  <text start="164.079" dur="4.56">that Blue Wave they keep talking about</text>
  <text start="165.579" dur="6">the idea that Democrats are gonna just</text>
  <text start="168.639" dur="4.13">take over in a big way when it comes the</text>
  <text start="171.579" dur="4.61">midterms</text>
  <text start="172.769" dur="7.33">apparently Senate polls are showing</text>
  <text start="176.189" dur="6.401">generic GOP sweeping Democrat incumbents</text>
  <text start="180.099" dur="5.01">from office for all the media hype about</text>
  <text start="182.59" dur="4.619">a blue wave sweeping Republicans from</text>
  <text start="185.109" dur="4.71">power in this November&amp;#39;s house incident</text>
  <text start="187.209" dur="5.491">midterm elections a comprehensive</text>
  <text start="189.819" dur="4.861">morning consult poll shows a Republican</text>
  <text start="192.7" dur="4.439">wave in the making in US Senate</text>
  <text start="194.68" dur="4.889">elections across the country with five</text>
  <text start="197.139" dur="5.13">Democrat incumbents decisively losing by</text>
  <text start="199.569" dur="5.09">at least five percent and four other</text>
  <text start="202.269" dur="4.951">Democrat incumbents in statistical ties</text>
  <text start="204.659" dur="5.23">naturally the poll has been ignored by</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="6.629">most of the MSM and that&amp;#39;s from the</text>
  <text start="209.889" dur="5.94">gateway ponder and Giuliani actually</text>
  <text start="213.849" dur="4.38">called for call me to be prosecuted</text>
  <text start="215.829" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s a big step</text>
  <text start="218.229" dur="3.9">and one of the major players who&amp;#39;s got a</text>
  <text start="220.209" dur="5.67">spotlight on him is shifting the</text>
  <text start="222.129" dur="5.341">narrative you know you know Trump has a</text>
  <text start="225.879" dur="3.06">team in place not all of them are</text>
  <text start="227.47" dur="4.289">trustworthy or anything yet but he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="228.939" dur="6.51">he&amp;#39;ll he&amp;#39;ll pitch the ball to another</text>
  <text start="231.759" dur="5.671">player the light is is you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="235.449" dur="4.44">sorry I&amp;#39;ve got state on my hands the</text>
  <text start="237.43" dur="4.649">light is completely and utterly on</text>
  <text start="239.889" dur="6.35">Giuliani right now he&amp;#39;s got all of these</text>
  <text start="242.079" dur="7.05">engine and then Giuliani will mirror a</text>
  <text start="246.239" dur="4.18">Trump move which I mean he&amp;#39;s working for</text>
  <text start="249.129" dur="1.681">Trump that&amp;#39;s completely normal that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.419" dur="2.28">fine</text>
  <text start="250.81" dur="4.769">so he&amp;#39;ll he&amp;#39;ll mirror something that</text>
  <text start="252.699" dur="5.85">Trump would want in this case going</text>
  <text start="255.579" dur="5.961">after combing so they play off of each</text>
  <text start="258.549" dur="7.221">other and then that effect is just</text>
  <text start="261.54" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s wonderful to see in a world where</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="4.29">generally we used to like all of the</text>
  <text start="267.12" dur="5.49">people power being bad guys and you know</text>
  <text start="270.06" dur="10.26">it&amp;#39;s good to see some of that influence</text>
  <text start="272.61" dur="13.8">be used for for good and the the feds</text>
  <text start="280.32" dur="7.56">had tapped Trump&amp;#39;s lawyers a phone what</text>
  <text start="286.41" dur="2.67">could I say I mean everybody&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="287.88" dur="3.39">about that today it&amp;#39;s no big surprise</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="6.21">they backtracked and said it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="291.27" dur="9.24">really a tap a wiretap that was just a a</text>
  <text start="295.29" dur="6.99">list of the calls in and out numbers</text>
  <text start="300.51" dur="5.04">that kind of thing not the content of</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="6.3">the message but still who&amp;#39;s surprised by</text>
  <text start="305.55" dur="4.23">this and economically there&amp;#39;s a couple</text>
  <text start="308.58" dur="3.24">things I want to mention and then</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="3.57">there&amp;#39;s a few others out there I just</text>
  <text start="311.82" dur="5.22">have a category other because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.35" dur="6.03">just random stuff one Goldman Sachs is</text>
  <text start="317.04" dur="3.33">now getting into Bitcoin basically</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;ve been they&amp;#39;ve been of the</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="3.78">position that bitcoin is a fraud and now</text>
  <text start="322.86" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re planning to trade it within</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="4.29">weeks so they&amp;#39;re getting into the</text>
  <text start="325.98" dur="4.26">exchange business or maybe not the</text>
  <text start="328.44" dur="4.61">exchange business but they&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="330.24" dur="5.55">into Bitcoin trading in some way and</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="5.98">this is just Goldman succumbing to the</text>
  <text start="335.79" dur="6.36">the pressure of this future technology I</text>
  <text start="339.03" dur="4.92">mean this is what it is all of the</text>
  <text start="342.15" dur="5.01">people that have a lot vested in the</text>
  <text start="343.95" dur="5.88">controlled manipulated dollar system are</text>
  <text start="347.16" dur="5.16">going to think or at least publicly call</text>
  <text start="349.83" dur="4.47">Bitcoin a fraud and a scam while they</text>
  <text start="352.32" dur="5.22">privately buy it up because they know</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s true they know it&amp;#39;s good that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="357.54" dur="4.02">you see so many of the elite getting</text>
  <text start="358.95" dur="6.54">into it now and so many of the elite</text>
  <text start="361.56" dur="6.33">still attacking it including the central</text>
  <text start="365.49" dur="5.07">banks by the way and in the other</text>
  <text start="367.89" dur="5.85">category so scientists are seeing that</text>
  <text start="370.56" dur="5.79">the Earth&amp;#39;s magnetic field is acting</text>
  <text start="373.74" dur="5.4">weird and that it could experience a</text>
  <text start="376.35" dur="5.09">shudder I mean technically we&amp;#39;re overdue</text>
  <text start="379.14" dur="4.2">and it could experience a flip of</text>
  <text start="381.44" dur="8.89">polarities or whatever that&amp;#39;s supposed</text>
  <text start="383.34" dur="8.67">to be and it won&amp;#39;t necessary attuned but</text>
  <text start="390.33" dur="4.39">it won&amp;#39;t necessarily hurt our bodies</text>
  <text start="392.01" dur="6.73">what it will possibly do is</text>
  <text start="394.72" dur="7.98">shift global weather patterns shift</text>
  <text start="398.74" dur="5.64">climate possibly destroy electronic</text>
  <text start="402.7" dur="5.58">equipment I could do it could do a lot</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="7.56">of harm kind of lesser than a solar</text>
  <text start="408.28" dur="5.49">flare but still pretty bad so I doubt</text>
  <text start="411.94" dur="3.69">this is gonna happen I&amp;#39;m not one to like</text>
  <text start="413.77" dur="3.84">put a lot of attention into things I</text>
  <text start="415.63" dur="3.96">can&amp;#39;t control like that but you know</text>
  <text start="417.61" dur="3.54">worth the if everything goes out</text>
  <text start="419.59" dur="3.47">suddenly and there&amp;#39;s no power maybe you</text>
  <text start="421.15" dur="7.53">weren&amp;#39;t iam peed maybe it was just a</text>
  <text start="423.06" dur="8.2">magnetic shift and that plane company</text>
  <text start="428.68" dur="5.52">that JetBlue that flies pizzas around</text>
  <text start="431.26" dur="5.04">and just a few hundreds around the</text>
  <text start="434.2" dur="4.5">country you know buy your get your New</text>
  <text start="436.3" dur="3.9">York Pizza and LA and Leo DiCaprio is</text>
  <text start="438.7" dur="4.11">using the service things like that</text>
  <text start="440.2" dur="4.35">well queue showed us a couple images of</text>
  <text start="442.81" dur="5.73">that plane in that those mysterious</text>
  <text start="444.55" dur="5.31">boxes it turns out Soros is one of the</text>
  <text start="448.54" dur="7.1">largest owners of JetBlue</text>
  <text start="449.86" dur="5.78">the airline delivering the visa so I</text>
  <text start="456.419" dur="7.211">want to say shocking but no not really</text>
  <text start="459.55" dur="8.04">I think the connections between Soros</text>
  <text start="463.63" dur="7.44">and Pizza Gate are largely unexplored</text>
  <text start="467.59" dur="5.85">but I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s some out there but</text>
  <text start="471.07" dur="5.01">I know I&amp;#39;m you know he&amp;#39;s a power player</text>
  <text start="473.44" dur="4.53">he&amp;#39;s a control figure he&amp;#39;s the one that</text>
  <text start="476.08" dur="5.19">would be behind a lot of that dirt</text>
  <text start="477.97" dur="8.1">collecting and manipulation of you know</text>
  <text start="481.27" dur="6.18">people influence so I think there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="486.07" dur="6.09">lot of trails that are gonna lead back</text>
  <text start="487.45" dur="6.779">to him with with pizza anyway that is it</text>
  <text start="492.16" dur="4.29">for the day there&amp;#39;s no queue post as if</text>
