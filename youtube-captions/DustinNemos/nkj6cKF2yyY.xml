  <text start="8.309" dur="4.261">takes a stand and of course we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="11.099" dur="3.96">to go into that we&amp;#39;re gonna go into</text>
  <text start="12.57" dur="4.56">censorship and digital book burning or</text>
  <text start="15.059" dur="3.681">bit burning as we call it stuff bit</text>
  <text start="17.13" dur="3.51">burning stop a digital book burning</text>
  <text start="18.74" dur="3.73">basically the essence of what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="20.64" dur="3.42">talking about here but this video is</text>
  <text start="22.47" dur="4.649">going to go into one of the strategies</text>
  <text start="24.06" dur="5.4">that we can utilize both as influencers</text>
  <text start="27.119" dur="5.431">and those who are subscribed to us to</text>
  <text start="29.46" dur="5.07">start to push back legally ethically and</text>
  <text start="32.55" dur="5.099">and kind of walk away from these</text>
  <text start="34.53" dur="4.439">platforms in essence so basically you</text>
  <text start="37.649" dur="3.451">guys have known for quite a while</text>
  <text start="38.969" dur="4.381">censorship has been going on I can show</text>
  <text start="41.1" dur="6.75">you what recently has started to ramp up</text>
  <text start="43.35" dur="7.74">here let&amp;#39;s see we had where they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="47.85" dur="4.439">start to turn videos private if you say</text>
  <text start="51.09" dur="3.059">something they don&amp;#39;t like this video</text>
  <text start="52.289" dur="3.721">here was called Trump&amp;#39;s Trump</text>
  <text start="54.149" dur="4.561">whistleblowers lawyer is traitor and</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="4.349">fake news pedophile defenders now you</text>
  <text start="58.71" dur="3.329">guys may have been following the videos</text>
  <text start="60.359" dur="4.321">I&amp;#39;ve done lately on that but either way</text>
  <text start="62.039" dur="4.741">this particular video was too much for</text>
  <text start="64.68" dur="4.17">YouTube too hot to handle so they turned</text>
  <text start="66.78" dur="4.83">it private you can&amp;#39;t even see it and if</text>
  <text start="68.85" dur="5.07">I try to set it to public here&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="5.7">happens I get a message that says sorry</text>
  <text start="73.92" dur="5.67">we were not able to save your video now</text>
  <text start="77.31" dur="4.59">there&amp;#39;s an appeal process but basically</text>
  <text start="79.59" dur="5.4">what that in essence means is you have</text>
  <text start="81.9" dur="5.46">to wait a few days if you get a flag on</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="4.08">this video that we don&amp;#39;t like before we</text>
  <text start="87.36" dur="3.24">will even look at it to determine if</text>
  <text start="89.07" dur="4.02">you&amp;#39;re gonna be allowed to show it to</text>
  <text start="90.6" dur="4.949">people it&amp;#39;s not a D monetization it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="93.09" dur="4.62">the next step they&amp;#39;re actively blocking</text>
  <text start="95.549" dur="4.411">you the viewer from seeing these videos</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="4.11">from channels that you subscribe to and</text>
  <text start="99.96" dur="3.39">Trust to tell you a different</text>
  <text start="101.82" dur="3.54">perspective and give you facts that</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="4.799">maybe don&amp;#39;t necessarily sync or</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="5.13">coordinate with fake news so here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="108.149" dur="3.93">what&amp;#39;s happening what do we do about it</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="3.36">alright so you guys know I have a</text>
  <text start="112.079" dur="4.441">hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="4.199">but some of the other platforms out</text>
  <text start="116.52" dur="3.209">there that aren&amp;#39;t as big and have as</text>
  <text start="118.049" dur="4.5">much money as Google which is owned by</text>
  <text start="119.729" dur="4.68">our YouTube is owned by Google they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="3.451">they&amp;#39;re up-and-coming they&amp;#39;re not quite</text>
  <text start="124.409" dur="3.63">there yet many of them have been</text>
  <text start="126" dur="3.36">struggling to handle the load the</text>
  <text start="128.039" dur="3.661">expense things of that nature</text>
  <text start="129.36" dur="5.97">one of the best ones out there is</text>
  <text start="131.7" dur="5.94">bitch shoot now bi TCH ute you see that</text>
  <text start="135.33" dur="4.83">up here in the corner in this case I</text>
  <text start="137.64" dur="5.31">want to bring you guys to the idea that</text>
  <text start="140.16" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s just one of many it&amp;#39;s not the go-to</text>
  <text start="142.95" dur="4.05">website for all of us it&amp;#39;s where many</text>
  <text start="145.02" dur="5.13">youtubers are going to I could name a</text>
  <text start="147" dur="4.86">few but you know you just saw one in</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="3.96">pursuit of truth is making his jump over</text>
  <text start="151.86" dur="6.06">as well it seems but the idea is not to</text>
  <text start="154.11" dur="5.34">go there and not stay on YouTube I want</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="3.27">to be very clear about this I have a</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="5.16">hundred thousand subscribers over here</text>
  <text start="161.19" dur="5.519">on bitch shoot I am 46 hundred that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="164.61" dur="3.54">big difference so if I want to continue</text>
  <text start="166.709" dur="3.09">being effective and trying to get the</text>
  <text start="168.15" dur="3.99">truth out I&amp;#39;ll be in both places</text>
  <text start="169.799" dur="4.261">however because of what&amp;#39;s going on with</text>
  <text start="172.14" dur="4.02">censorship and some things being too</text>
  <text start="174.06" dur="4.53">much for YouTube we have to be</text>
  <text start="176.16" dur="4.859">two-tiered about things from now on so</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="3.69">if it&amp;#39;s really really controversial and</text>
  <text start="181.019" dur="3.571">I know that YouTube is gonna ban it</text>
  <text start="182.28" dur="3.81">anyway I&amp;#39;m gonna make a video on YouTube</text>
  <text start="184.59" dur="4.229">to tell you about what&amp;#39;s happening and</text>
  <text start="186.09" dur="4.47">then I&amp;#39;m going to link a video on bitch</text>
  <text start="188.819" dur="3.811">shoot that goes into the details because</text>
  <text start="190.56" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s the only way that we&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="192.63" dur="4.47">to continue having this conversation now</text>
  <text start="194.61" dur="4.23">the benefit of that for us and the</text>
  <text start="197.1" dur="5.04">detriment for YouTube is that it forces</text>
  <text start="198.84" dur="5.55">us to siphon their customers and our</text>
  <text start="202.14" dur="4.65">audiences away from their platform and</text>
  <text start="204.39" dur="3.81">their control grid into a platform that</text>
  <text start="206.79" dur="3.63">doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily care about</text>
  <text start="208.2" dur="3.72">censorship and such you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="210.42" dur="4.02">know that much about vid shoot but there</text>
  <text start="211.92" dur="4.14">certainly know Google and we need to be</text>
  <text start="214.44" dur="3.21">in all of the different websites so</text>
  <text start="216.06" dur="3.45">every influencer may have a different</text>
  <text start="217.65" dur="4.559">favorite there are different websites</text>
  <text start="219.51" dur="5.52">out there like bright Aeon or huge tube</text>
  <text start="222.209" dur="5.491">with Utah gun exchange or or bit tubers</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="4.799">is out there&amp;#39;s minds.com there&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="227.7" dur="4.56">these different ones so for us we now</text>
  <text start="229.829" dur="4.41">have to grow in the face of censorship</text>
  <text start="232.26" dur="4.41">once again and we have to now be</text>
  <text start="234.239" dur="3.931">everywhere some something where they</text>
  <text start="236.67" dur="3.21">can&amp;#39;t delete us from the internet they</text>
  <text start="238.17" dur="3.78">can&amp;#39;t erase us from the internet and</text>
  <text start="239.88" dur="3.87">also many of these different programs</text>
  <text start="241.95" dur="3.84">are blocked by different technologies</text>
  <text start="243.75" dur="4.92">some of them are blocked are not blocked</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="4.919">but brought on by different technologies</text>
  <text start="248.67" dur="3.78">including like cryptocurrency technology</text>
  <text start="250.709" dur="3.481">or blockchain technology that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="252.45" dur="4.2">thinking block so there&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="4.349">things that are going on in behind the</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="4.47">scenes to get these platforms to the</text>
  <text start="258.539" dur="6.241">level where they can replace YouTube or</text>
  <text start="261.12" dur="4.32">Facebook or Twitter or Google or any of</text>
  <text start="264.78" dur="2.88">these bitcoins</text>
  <text start="265.44" dur="4.38">so of course it&amp;#39;s always an uphill</text>
  <text start="267.66" dur="3.78">battle David and Goliath but I think</text>
  <text start="269.82" dur="3.09">bitch shoot is almost there some days</text>
  <text start="271.44" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;re a little slow still sometimes</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;re a little slow to upload videos</text>
  <text start="274.17" dur="4.35">but listen if YouTube wasn&amp;#39;t around</text>
  <text start="276.33" dur="4.65">bitch shoot would be a hot website right</text>
  <text start="278.52" dur="4.65">now and it&amp;#39;s growing so if you want to</text>
  <text start="280.98" dur="3.75">you know continue to see the videos that</text>
  <text start="283.17" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;re seeing from your favorite</text>
  <text start="284.73" dur="4.65">influencers tell them make a transition</text>
  <text start="287.7" dur="3.54">you don&amp;#39;t have to quit YouTube you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="289.38" dur="3.45">have to abandon what you&amp;#39;re doing but</text>
  <text start="291.24" dur="4.11">you can really set up a bitch shoot</text>
  <text start="292.83" dur="4.53">pretty quickly you can also set it up on</text>
  <text start="295.35" dur="4.47">bitch you to automatically pull your</text>
  <text start="297.36" dur="4.44">YouTube videos this is a big deal let me</text>
  <text start="299.82" dur="4.32">be clear two youtubers we&amp;#39;re very much</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="4.26">out of time all of us are working at</text>
  <text start="304.14" dur="3.57">least all the ones I know are working</text>
  <text start="306.06" dur="3.6">our butts off to bring you the truth and</text>
  <text start="307.71" dur="5.13">to be effective agents for truth in this</text>
  <text start="309.66" dur="5.46">whole fake news versus everyone else a</text>
  <text start="312.84" dur="5.34">fight for the narrative and the future</text>
  <text start="315.12" dur="5.31">of our world and our country so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.18" dur="5.01">all very busy people what that means for</text>
  <text start="320.43" dur="4.41">us is we can set it and forget it too in</text>
  <text start="323.19" dur="2.94">essence for a while we can talk about</text>
  <text start="324.84" dur="3.78">our pitch shoot account but we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="326.13" dur="4.35">have to go make a double upload on every</text>
  <text start="328.62" dur="4.41">different video we make some of us do a</text>
  <text start="330.48" dur="4.47">video every day like I myself do often</text>
  <text start="333.03" dur="2.97">so what we can do is we&amp;#39;ll seek it to</text>
  <text start="334.95" dur="3.24">our YouTube account</text>
  <text start="336" dur="5.21">it automatically ports and pulls those</text>
  <text start="338.19" dur="5.91">videos and then it just uploads them at</text>
  <text start="341.21" dur="4.57">4,700 subscribers on bit shoot I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="344.1" dur="3.24">have to work very hard for that because</text>
  <text start="345.78" dur="3.69">bitch you automatically pulled the</text>
  <text start="347.34" dur="3.78">videos over from YouTube where I was</text>
  <text start="349.47" dur="5.85">working my butt off to get these things</text>
  <text start="351.12" dur="7.47">done so it&amp;#39;s one more item in our</text>
  <text start="355.32" dur="5.25">toolkit our arsenal to resist against</text>
  <text start="358.59" dur="4.56">the censorship from big tech so I</text>
  <text start="360.57" dur="4.86">encourage everyone to go out share the</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="4.5">word share the the phrase bit burning or</text>
  <text start="365.43" dur="5.46">stop get burning or hash tag stop bit</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="5.61">burning or www stop bit burning com</text>
  <text start="370.89" dur="6.18">helped us to resist censorship and this</text>
  <text start="373.26" dur="5.31">is a coalition movement a roundtable</text>
  <text start="377.07" dur="3.09">conversation to bring all of the</text>
  <text start="378.57" dur="3.51">influencers together so that we can be</text>
  <text start="380.16" dur="3.93">effective with these moves and other</text>
  <text start="382.08" dur="4.17">moves like potentially suing them with a</text>
  <text start="384.09" dur="3.84">class-action lawsuit for what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="386.25" dur="3.09">doing to us of course I&amp;#39;ve been super</text>

  <text start="391.77" dur="3.12">subscribers move from 96,000 in almost a</text>
  <text start="394.56" dur="2.94">year</text>
  <text start="394.89" dur="4.23">so we all know what&amp;#39;s going on now we</text>
