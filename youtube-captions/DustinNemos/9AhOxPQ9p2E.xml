  <text start="160.8" dur="3.24">that</text>
  <text start="161.61" dur="4.86">because Durham is progressing very very</text>
  <text start="164.04" dur="4.65">quickly in his criminal investigations</text>
  <text start="166.47" dur="3.87">this is not a review quote/unquote of</text>
  <text start="168.69" dur="4.86">what went on this is a criminal</text>
  <text start="170.34" dur="5.52">investigation of senior DOJ and FBI</text>
  <text start="173.55" dur="4.14">officials from the Obama administration</text>

  <text start="180.33" dur="4.97">grand jury this is not a review this is</text>
  <text start="182.67" dur="4.98">not an IG audit this is not some</text>
  <text start="185.3" dur="3.9">Congressional Research Service of look</text>
  <text start="187.65" dur="4.08">at history this is a criminal</text>
  <text start="189.2" dur="5.14">investigation of a bunch of people who</text>
  <text start="191.73" dur="5.19">tried to suspiciously overthrow the</text>
  <text start="194.34" dur="3.93">President of the United States so the</text>
  <text start="196.92" dur="8.55">stuff that&amp;#39;s going to start coming out</text>
  <text start="198.27" dur="10.95">this week we&amp;#39;ll be able to see document</text>
  <text start="205.47" dur="5.4">Wednesday I understand okay and then</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="3.15">unleashes Devon Nunez what were the</text>
  <text start="210.87" dur="3.39">document Devon Nunez was seeking was it</text>
  <text start="212.37" dur="4.11">related to unmasking or wiretapping what</text>
  <text start="214.26" dur="4.74">they were all the things related to he</text>
  <text start="216.48" dur="5.78">made a female several requests by letter</text>
  <text start="219" dur="6.75">as you know of various items</text>
  <text start="222.26" dur="5.68">302 the applications for the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="225.75" dur="4.32">maybe Devon nudists had made has made</text>
  <text start="227.94" dur="3.99">many many requests yet declassification</text>
  <text start="230.07" dur="3.69">I&amp;#39;m not sure which ones they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="231.93" dur="8.43">come out first but they&amp;#39;re coming there</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="9">oh boy so while a lot of people have</text>
  <text start="240.36" dur="6.17">been waiting for the IG report from</text>
  <text start="242.76" dur="8.19">Michael Horowitz in the background</text>
  <text start="246.53" dur="8.579">Durham and others including bar and</text>
  <text start="250.95" dur="6.93">Huber have been conducting criminal</text>
  <text start="255.109" dur="6.821">investigations in the background very</text>
  <text start="257.88" dur="8.33">quietly so the IG report is more of an</text>
  <text start="261.93" dur="7.29">internal review that may make</text>
  <text start="266.21" dur="6.04">recommendations for criminal referrals</text>
  <text start="269.22" dur="5.04">but it is not the same as a criminal</text>
  <text start="272.25" dur="5.669">investigation a criminal investigation</text>
  <text start="274.26" dur="6.84">is actively investigating crimes and has</text>
  <text start="277.919" dur="4.921">the power to prosecute those crimes this</text>
  <text start="281.1" dur="4.319">is a big deal and also if you caught</text>
  <text start="282.84" dur="7.139">that he mentioned that you know these</text>
  <text start="285.419" dur="7.921">documents had to do with also a grand</text>
  <text start="289.979" dur="6.871">jury this</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="7.35">is the same grand jury that prevented</text>
  <text start="296.85" dur="10.23">Muller from answering questions at his</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="9.24">testimony recently this is a big deal</text>
  <text start="307.08" dur="5.04">because some people have said that</text>
  <text start="309.93" dur="3.87">nothing is happening but these people</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="5.04">aren&amp;#39;t going to be held accountable well</text>
  <text start="313.8" dur="5.429">here&amp;#39;s the thing when it comes to a real</text>
  <text start="317.16" dur="4.14">criminal investigation especially one of</text>
  <text start="319.229" dur="4.5">this caliber you&amp;#39;re not going to see it</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="6.72">out in the open until they are ready to</text>
  <text start="323.729" dur="8.461">prosecute so this is big news because</text>
  <text start="328.02" dur="6.36">this means that they are very close to</text>
  <text start="332.19" dur="5.94">closing in on these people including</text>
  <text start="334.38" dur="6.84">John Brennan and that&amp;#39;s why John Brennan</text>
  <text start="338.13" dur="5.46">has been so vocal and also that is</text>
  <text start="341.22" dur="5.75">another reason why John Brennan is so</text>
  <text start="343.59" dur="7.56">against Ratcliffe replacing coats</text>
  <text start="346.97" dur="5.8">because coats is one of them he does not</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="3.57">want to see someone come in and have</text>
  <text start="352.77" dur="6.149">oversight over the intelligence</text>
  <text start="354.72" dur="9.15">community and clean them out this is a</text>
  <text start="358.919" dur="6.541">really big deal so not all of the</text>
  <text start="363.87" dur="4.109">material is going to be coming out by</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="5.73">Wednesday but a good portion of it is so</text>
  <text start="367.979" dur="6.12">now we&amp;#39;re going to see the unraveling of</text>
  <text start="371.19" dur="5.37">this material the rolling out of this</text>
  <text start="374.099" dur="5.431">material and the public is going to see</text>
  <text start="376.56" dur="5.22">exactly what this Russian investigation</text>
  <text start="379.53" dur="3.6">really was which was a coup attempt the</text>
  <text start="381.78" dur="4.05">whole thing was a hoax from the</text>
  <text start="383.13" dur="5.52">beginning they were digging around</text>
  <text start="385.83" dur="4.89">trying to find something anything that</text>
  <text start="388.65" dur="5.269">they could hold against Trump then</text>
  <text start="390.72" dur="4.65">candidate Trump and then eventually</text>
  <text start="393.919" dur="3.821">President Trump</text>
  <text start="395.37" dur="6.03">just so they could prevent him from</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="6.27">being in that presidential seat treason</text>
  <text start="401.4" dur="9.48">this is treason people don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="404.01" dur="8.4">the gravity of that crime or maybe they</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="6.17">do but really they don&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="412.41" dur="4.64">thinking about it treason is a big deal</text>
  <text start="417.44" dur="5.789">so these people are under investigation</text>
  <text start="421.68" dur="5.5">right now</text>
  <text start="423.229" dur="5.781">Hoover Barr and Durham</text>
  <text start="427.18" dur="6.87">have been investigating this while</text>
  <text start="429.01" dur="6.93">everyone&amp;#39;s been looking to Horowitz it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.05" dur="6.45">like look over here but don&amp;#39;t look over</text>
  <text start="435.94" dur="8.13">here I&amp;#39;ve known since day one that they</text>
  <text start="440.5" dur="9.36">even mentioned Hoover&amp;#39;s name that they</text>
  <text start="444.07" dur="9.69">were investigating these crimes Hoover</text>
  <text start="449.86" dur="5.82">and Durham working quietly in the</text>
  <text start="453.76" dur="3.54">background well pretty soon it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="455.68" dur="3.69">going to be in the background and these</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="4.88">crimes are going to come to light so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="459.37" dur="8.07">very excited about that actually</text>
  <text start="462.18" dur="10.33">all right in other news the yellow vest</text>
  <text start="467.44" dur="6.63">protests continue for this 37th week 37</text>
  <text start="472.51" dur="4.17">weeks this has been going on this is a</text>
  <text start="474.07" dur="7.879">long time this is like nearly three</text>
  <text start="476.68" dur="7.98">quarters of a year with no end in sight</text>
  <text start="481.949" dur="5.801">because really what will end up</text>
  <text start="484.66" dur="6.259">happening in order to stop these</text>
  <text start="487.75" dur="5.97">protests is that McCrone must step down</text>
  <text start="490.919" dur="5.171">he is the reason why these protests</text>
  <text start="493.72" dur="8.61">continue because it was never really</text>
  <text start="496.09" dur="7.71">about the gas tax in the very beginning</text>
  <text start="502.33" dur="3.99">when they were covering this in the</text>
  <text start="503.8" dur="4.29">mainstream media they claimed that I had</text>
  <text start="506.32" dur="3.569">to do with the gas tax but really that</text>
  <text start="508.09" dur="3.509">was more or less just the straw that</text>
  <text start="509.889" dur="4.46">broke the camel&amp;#39;s back and had nothing</text>
  <text start="511.599" dur="6.421">to do with the real underlying cause of</text>
  <text start="514.349" dur="9.971">these protests they&amp;#39;re angry with the</text>
  <text start="518.02" dur="7.86">globalist policies that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.32" dur="4.11">really mad about that&amp;#39;s what this is</text>
  <text start="525.88" dur="4.35">about this is about the government that</text>
  <text start="528.43" dur="4.08">is in place going against the will of</text>
  <text start="530.23" dur="7.65">the people so the will of the people is</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="10.38">now manifesting in these protests so</text>
  <text start="537.88" dur="8.18">there was a twitter by david vance where</text>
  <text start="542.89" dur="7.56">it shows how mcrawlins police force is</text>
  <text start="546.06" dur="9.73">really pulverizing these people the</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="7.889">citizens of this country using force so</text>
  <text start="555.79" dur="4.74">while the media is covering quite</text>
  <text start="558.339" dur="4.561">extensively the protests in Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="560.53" dur="4.56">where you won&amp;#39;t see this type of</text>
  <text start="562.9" dur="4.47">response against the people you know the</text>
  <text start="565.09" dur="6.18">police there are not using this type of</text>
  <text start="567.37" dur="7.05">force here in this example with the</text>
  <text start="571.27" dur="5.81">yellow vest errs and they&amp;#39;re using brute</text>
  <text start="574.42" dur="6.15">force against them by order of McCrone</text>
  <text start="577.08" dur="6.09">this isn&amp;#39;t being covered because they</text>
  <text start="580.57" dur="5.67">don&amp;#39;t want you to see this</text>
  <text start="583.17" dur="5.5">now also farmers recently have joined</text>
  <text start="586.24" dur="5.4">the yellow vest errs in protesting the</text>
  <text start="588.67" dur="5.01">government so two days after the yellow</text>
  <text start="591.64" dur="4.26">vest protesters set an office used by</text>
  <text start="593.68" dur="4.59">the unmarked party they set it on fire</text>
  <text start="595.9" dur="4.26">farmers ransacked a government office</text>
  <text start="598.27" dur="7.95">with eggs and green goofy tea and even</text>
  <text start="600.16" dur="9.54">hay so they&amp;#39;re Pro that what they were</text>
  <text start="606.22" dur="6.75">protesting was the approval of an EU</text>
  <text start="609.7" dur="5.13">Canada trade deal called cita and so</text>
  <text start="612.97" dur="4.08">opponents to this trade deal had said</text>
  <text start="614.83" dur="5.88">that undermines regulation so in</text>
  <text start="617.05" dur="6.48">imported products they are produced</text>
  <text start="620.71" dur="4.77">under conditions that are not allowed in</text>
  <text start="623.53" dur="5.04">Europe and so it was opposed by the</text>
  <text start="625.48" dur="5.28">people however the government decided to</text>
  <text start="628.57" dur="4.8">go ahead with the trade deal even though</text>
  <text start="630.76" dur="5.22">the people opposed it a big majority of</text>
  <text start="633.37" dur="5.13">the people opposed and again this is</text>
  <text start="635.98" dur="5.58">what these vote these protests really</text>
  <text start="638.5" dur="4.68">are about it&amp;#39;s really about the</text>
  <text start="641.56" dur="3.48">government going against the will of the</text>
  <text start="643.18" dur="3.6">people so the people want to overthrow</text>
  <text start="645.04" dur="5.58">this government because they&amp;#39;re no</text>
  <text start="646.78" dur="6.03">longer serving them and that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="650.62" dur="8.73">what this is about with immigration with</text>
  <text start="652.81" dur="8.85">globalism the tree everything everything</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="6">so that&amp;#39;s really what this is about and</text>
  <text start="661.66" dur="7.62">it will not stop until McCrone steps</text>
  <text start="665.35" dur="8.58">down okay</text>
  <text start="669.28" dur="6.57">other news nasty Trump heating lunatic</text>

  <text start="692.14" dur="4.59">screams about opposition</text>
  <text start="694.3" dur="5.04">all day long that&amp;#39;s all she has done I</text>
  <text start="696.73" dur="4.95">haven&amp;#39;t heard of her doing anything of</text>
  <text start="699.34" dur="4.59">substance since she has been in office</text>
  <text start="701.68" dur="4.32">and you know the very first memory that</text>
  <text start="703.93" dur="4.71">I have of her seeing her was being</text>
  <text start="706" dur="6">kicked out as a heckler and I knew then</text>

  <text start="742.83" dur="6.58">representing the people and all she has</text>

  <text start="749.41" dur="6.45">language I&amp;#39;m sorry the way I feel about</text>
  <text start="753.43" dur="5.64">vulgar language really and I hope nobody</text>
  <text start="755.86" dur="5.82">is offended by this but and this is</text>
  <text start="759.07" dur="6.45">especially true of people who are</text>
  <text start="761.68" dur="8.91">supposed to be in positions of honor and</text>
  <text start="765.52" dur="9">respect using vulgar language in my</text>
  <text start="770.59" dur="6.03">opinion is a cop-out and it just</text>
  <text start="774.52" dur="6.33">demonstrates that she has nothing of</text>
  <text start="776.62" dur="6.83">value to say and she doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="780.85" dur="7.31">anything of value to do she has no</text>
  <text start="783.45" dur="8.32">policy platform other than opposition so</text>
  <text start="788.16" dur="7.69">apparently when she was voted in she won</text>
  <text start="791.77" dur="7.32">her district by a very narrow margin of</text>
  <text start="795.85" dur="7.32">about 30% but this was against five</text>
  <text start="799.09" dur="6.48">other opponents now going into the next</text>
  <text start="803.17" dur="5.85">election there&amp;#39;s only one other opponent</text>
  <text start="805.57" dur="6.93">so mathematically how are you going to</text>
  <text start="809.02" dur="5.52">win with only 30% you&amp;#39;re not so she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="812.5" dur="4.83">gonna be voted out also at the same time</text>
  <text start="814.54" dur="5.64">a lot of her constituents in that area</text>
  <text start="817.33" dur="5.4">are very displeased with her lack of</text>
  <text start="820.18" dur="3">work she&amp;#39;s not doing anything for her</text>
  <text start="822.73" dur="2.34">people</text>
  <text start="823.18" dur="5.07">all that she&amp;#39;s doing is going around</text>
  <text start="825.07" dur="5.97">trying to gain popularity by screaming</text>
  <text start="828.25" dur="6.42">about the president that&amp;#39;s all she has</text>
  <text start="831.04" dur="8.22">so see you later Rasheeda Talib you are</text>
  <text start="834.67" dur="6.78">out of here in other news Joe Biden two</text>
  <text start="839.26" dur="4.26">opponents if you come at me I will hit</text>
  <text start="841.45" dur="3.93">back so it looks like things are</text>
  <text start="843.52" dur="3.3">starting to heat up between all of the</text>
  <text start="845.38" dur="3.9">Democratic frontrunner and of course</text>
  <text start="846.82" dur="5.4">this is a head of the Democratic debates</text>
  <text start="849.28" dur="7.97">starting tonight going into tomorrow and</text>
  <text start="852.22" dur="7.86">so right now Joe Biden has been</text>
  <text start="857.25" dur="5.35">challenged by other contenders over his</text>
  <text start="860.08" dur="5.04">civil rights record they&amp;#39;re going all</text>
  <text start="862.6" dur="5.91">the way back to when they were talking</text>
  <text start="865.12" dur="7.08">about segregation and busing Americans</text>
  <text start="868.51" dur="5.85">and Harris Kamala Harris had actually</text>
  <text start="872.2" dur="4.56">questioned him about this at the last</text>
  <text start="874.36" dur="4.47">debate and now Joe Biden had been a</text>
  <text start="876.76" dur="4.35">major front-runner before the debate and</text>
  <text start="878.83" dur="7.5">his popularity had dropped a little bit</text>
  <text start="881.11" dur="7.95">after he failed to really respond to her</text>
  <text start="886.33" dur="5.58">challenge at that debate and of course</text>
  <text start="889.06" dur="5.88">also Booker has come out making a</text>
  <text start="891.91" dur="6.78">statement that you know Joe Biden was</text>
  <text start="894.94" dur="5.91">also an accomplice to the creation of</text>
  <text start="898.69" dur="4.56">mass incarceration during the Obama</text>
  <text start="900.85" dur="3.96">administration and then of course Biden</text>
  <text start="903.25" dur="3.66">hit back on that and said well you know</text>
  <text start="904.81" dur="4.44">if he wants to talk about past records</text>
  <text start="906.91" dur="5.97">then I would ask him about while he was</text>
  <text start="909.25" dur="6.08">mayor and his police force were frisking</text>
  <text start="912.88" dur="6.63">individuals and really targeting</text>
  <text start="915.33" dur="6.94">african-americans so there seems to be a</text>
  <text start="919.51" dur="6.54">major spanic going on between the three</text>
  <text start="922.27" dur="6.89">frontrunner Booker Harris and Biden over</text>
  <text start="926.05" dur="5.13">race now recently all of the Democrat</text>
  <text start="929.16" dur="3.91">candidates they did show up at</text>
  <text start="931.18" dur="4.25">conferences that were hosted by civil</text>
  <text start="933.07" dur="6.45">rights groups on criminal justice reform</text>
  <text start="935.43" dur="5.44">now none of them really have anything to</text>
  <text start="939.52" dur="6.81">say about criminal justice reform</text>
  <text start="940.87" dur="7.99">especially Biden because Biden was vice</text>
  <text start="946.33" dur="5.74">president to Obama</text>
  <text start="948.86" dur="6">and again they have a record for mass</text>
  <text start="952.07" dur="7.17">incarceration that largely targeted</text>
  <text start="954.86" dur="7.02">black Americans now President Trump has</text>
  <text start="959.24" dur="8.25">done a lot for criminal justice reform</text>
  <text start="961.88" dur="8.16">and of course you know that has been one</text>
  <text start="967.49" dur="5.67">of those things where people have said</text>
  <text start="970.04" dur="8.4">that it was impossible that prison</text>
  <text start="973.16" dur="8.31">reform was impossible so after 25 years</text>
  <text start="978.44" dur="4.59">of the issue being on the table and no</text>
  <text start="981.47" dur="5.04">one being able to do anything about it</text>
  <text start="983.03" dur="8">president Trump comes in and does major</text>
  <text start="986.51" dur="8.61">work on the criminal justice system</text>
  <text start="991.03" dur="6.31">including the first-step Act which the</text>
  <text start="995.12" dur="5.85">first beneficiary of that was a black</text>
  <text start="997.34" dur="8.07">American woman and of course you know</text>
  <text start="1000.97" dur="7.95">this act really does a lot to make sure</text>
  <text start="1005.41" dur="5.16">that those who were incarcerated when</text>
  <text start="1008.92" dur="4.17">they get out they can be productive</text>
  <text start="1010.57" dur="4.05">members of society it helps prevent them</text>
  <text start="1013.09" dur="6.03">from returning to the criminal justice</text>
  <text start="1014.62" dur="7.02">system which often happens there is this</text>
  <text start="1019.12" dur="5.49">cycle where when people end up going to</text>
  <text start="1021.64" dur="3.75">jail they end up going back time and</text>
  <text start="1024.61" dur="3.14">time again</text>
  <text start="1025.39" dur="5.84">so the first step act is really a</text>
  <text start="1027.75" dur="6.55">program that&amp;#39;s meant to prevent that and</text>
  <text start="1031.23" dur="6.54">to really help people get back in to</text>
  <text start="1034.3" dur="6.72">society which is a good thing</text>
  <text start="1037.77" dur="5.41">President Trump has done so much for the</text>
  <text start="1041.02" dur="4.35">criminal justice system that I would</text>
  <text start="1043.18" dur="4.86">really like to see what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1045.37" dur="4.23">bring to the table in that regard which</text>
  <text start="1048.04" dur="2.28">at this point they don&amp;#39;t really have a</text>
  <text start="1049.6" dur="2.67">plan</text>
  <text start="1050.32" dur="3.33">they just make statements about how</text>
  <text start="1052.27" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;re going to reform the criminal</text>
  <text start="1053.65" dur="4.29">justice system just like immigration</text>
  <text start="1055.18" dur="4.92">they they say that they&amp;#39;re about</text>
  <text start="1057.94" dur="5.46">immigration reform but none of them have</text>
  <text start="1060.1" dur="5.43">a plan there&amp;#39;s no plan the only plan is</text>
  <text start="1063.4" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re going to overturn everything that</text>
  <text start="1065.53" dur="5.52">President Trump has done which makes no</text>
  <text start="1068.59" dur="5.78">sense because the country is in a much</text>
  <text start="1071.05" dur="3.32">better position than it was before</text>
  <text start="1075.27" dur="5.74">all right so related to that we have the</text>
  <text start="1078.52" dur="3.9">Democrat debates starting tonight and</text>
  <text start="1081.01" dur="5.16">going into tomorrow</text>
  <text start="1082.42" dur="7.35">so to qualify for the debates each</text>
  <text start="1086.17" dur="5.73">candidate must have had one at least 1%</text>
  <text start="1089.77" dur="4.26">in the polls in three different polls</text>
  <text start="1091.9" dur="6.3">that were of course you know deemed as</text>
  <text start="1094.03" dur="8.01">legitimate and on top of that they also</text>
  <text start="1098.2" dur="6.24">had have had six hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="1102.04" dur="6.86">thousand donors two hundred of which</text>
  <text start="1104.44" dur="4.46">must have been in 20 different states so</text>
  <text start="1109.35" dur="5.8">showing up in Detroit for round two of</text>
  <text start="1112.51" dur="5.72">these Democratic debates and tonight&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1115.15" dur="6.45">round up we have Tim Ryan Amy Klobuchar</text>
  <text start="1118.23" dur="6.61">Pete Buddha gag Bernie Sanders Elizabeth</text>
  <text start="1121.6" dur="5.7">Warren bets it will work in John Delaney</text>
  <text start="1124.84" dur="5.67">and then tomorrow night we have Kirsten</text>
  <text start="1127.3" dur="5.82">Gillibrand Julian Castro Cory Booker Joe</text>
  <text start="1130.51" dur="5.43">Biden Kamala Harris Tulsi Gabbard Bill</text>
  <text start="1133.12" dur="5.19">DeBlasio and of course Tom Styer did not</text>
  <text start="1135.94" dur="4.29">qualify so they each will have 60</text>
  <text start="1138.31" dur="3.75">seconds to answer moderators questions</text>
  <text start="1140.23" dur="3.6">and 30 seconds for rebuttal</text>
  <text start="1142.06" dur="4.53">now it will be interesting to see even</text>
  <text start="1143.83" dur="5.1">though you know this lineup was made at</text>
  <text start="1146.59" dur="4.47">random so they picked candidates at</text>
  <text start="1148.93" dur="4.67">random however on night 2 that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1151.06" dur="6.51">tomorrow we have the three top runners</text>
  <text start="1153.6" dur="6.31">Kamala Harris Joe Biden and Cory Booker</text>
  <text start="1157.57" dur="3.84">are going to be facing off so this</text>
  <text start="1159.91" dur="7.41">should be interesting scenes how there</text>
  <text start="1161.41" dur="9.12">is a current spat over race okay and</text>
  <text start="1167.32" dur="7.56">other news Kamala Harris has a health</text>
  <text start="1170.53" dur="7.95">plan that is supposed to roll out over a</text>
  <text start="1174.88" dur="5.31">period of ten years now this is rivaling</text>
  <text start="1178.48" dur="4.22">Bernie Sanders health plan of course</text>
  <text start="1180.19" dur="4.62">this is the Medicare for all this is the</text>
  <text start="1182.7" dur="7.75">government-sanctioned health care plan</text>
  <text start="1184.81" dur="9.21">single pair so they differ in a few key</text>
  <text start="1190.45" dur="5.82">ways so one Bernie Sanders and his plan</text>
  <text start="1194.02" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s supposed to roll out in four years</text>
  <text start="1196.27" dur="4.17">whereas hers is rolling out on ten now</text>
  <text start="1198.37" dur="5.22">the thing that&amp;#39;s kind of confusing here</text>
  <text start="1200.44" dur="6.72">is that really this is almost like</text>
  <text start="1203.59" dur="5.46">dangling a carrot to those who would</text>
  <text start="1207.16" dur="4.7">maybe buy into the Medicare for all</text>
  <text start="1209.05" dur="4.91">because 10 years</text>
  <text start="1211.86" dur="4.169">ten years you&amp;#39;re not even gonna be in</text>
  <text start="1213.96" dur="4.829">office for ten years you&amp;#39;re gonna be in</text>
  <text start="1216.029" dur="6.921">office maybe for eight if you&amp;#39;re lucky</text>
  <text start="1218.789" dur="6.811">to me to be even voted in so really if</text>
  <text start="1222.95" dur="4.959">you&amp;#39;re going to be making a plan like</text>
  <text start="1225.6" dur="7.26">this it should be something that you can</text>
  <text start="1227.909" dur="9.421">fully roll out within your term right</text>
  <text start="1232.86" dur="6.48">but at any rate so the other key</text>
  <text start="1237.33" dur="2.25">difference is how it&amp;#39;s going to be paid</text>
  <text start="1239.34" dur="3.929">for</text>
  <text start="1239.58" dur="8.3">so this medicare-for-all is supposed to</text>
  <text start="1243.269" dur="7.591">cost about 40 trillion dollars now</text>
  <text start="1247.88" dur="4.87">currently healthcare for everyone</text>
  <text start="1250.86" dur="3.539">cost the government about 60 trillion</text>
  <text start="1252.75" dur="3.87">dollars so how are they going to make up</text>
  <text start="1254.399" dur="3.091">the difference anyway because it really</text>
  <text start="1256.62" dur="4.32">comes up short</text>
  <text start="1257.49" dur="5.669">well the way that they&amp;#39;re going to raise</text>
  <text start="1260.94" dur="4.68">all of this money the 40 trillion</text>
  <text start="1263.159" dur="6.061">dollars is that Bernie Sanders says</text>
  <text start="1265.62" dur="9.74">there&amp;#39;s going to be a 4% tax hike on</text>
  <text start="1269.22" dur="10.35">families who make more than $29,000 are</text>
  <text start="1275.36" dur="7.24">you kidding me Bernie Sanders where did</text>
  <text start="1279.57" dur="4.62">you go to school for economics and you</text>
  <text start="1282.6" dur="4.89">know what&amp;#39;s really funny about this is</text>
  <text start="1284.19" dur="7.14">that this is the face of the Socialist</text>
  <text start="1287.49" dur="6.39">Party Bernie Sanders and so all of the</text>
  <text start="1291.33" dur="4.229">little social justice warriors when they</text>
  <text start="1293.88" dur="5.13">think about socialism they think that it</text>
  <text start="1295.559" dur="5.791">helps the poor people first of all his</text>
  <text start="1299.01" dur="5.25">misstep recently was where he</text>
  <text start="1301.35" dur="5.189">demonstrated to everyone that the $15</text>
  <text start="1304.26" dur="5.43">minimum wage will not work so of course</text>
  <text start="1306.539" dur="5.821">you know his campaign staffers had</text>
  <text start="1309.69" dur="5.19">unionized and then they demanded the $15</text>
  <text start="1312.36" dur="4.799">minimum wage they got it however their</text>
  <text start="1314.88" dur="4.49">hours were cut so much so that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1317.159" dur="5.701">still getting the same amount of money</text>
  <text start="1319.37" dur="6.399">proving why an increase in wage will not</text>
  <text start="1322.86" dur="6.21">work because the employer will always</text>
  <text start="1325.769" dur="5.16">look for a way to save money so even</text>
  <text start="1329.07" dur="3.989">Bernie Sanders the face of the Socialist</text>
  <text start="1330.929" dur="4.801">Party proved that so now he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="1333.059" dur="4.381">that the cost of the Medicare for all is</text>
  <text start="1335.73" dur="4.11">going to be on the backs of the middle</text>
  <text start="1337.44" dur="6.599">class and the lower middle class at that</text>
  <text start="1339.84" dur="4.92">because I can tell you that $30,000 a</text>
  <text start="1344.039" dur="7.401">year</text>
  <text start="1344.76" dur="7.97">family is nothing nothing in today&amp;#39;s age</text>
  <text start="1351.44" dur="4.87">seriously</text>
  <text start="1352.73" dur="7.03">$30,000 will barely allow you to pay for</text>
  <text start="1356.31" dur="6.36">your house maybe your car and maybe the</text>
  <text start="1359.76" dur="7.68">minimum amount of food $30,000 for a</text>
  <text start="1362.67" dur="8.19">family is not sufficient living so now</text>
  <text start="1367.44" dur="8.37">you&amp;#39;re going to increase taxes on the</text>
  <text start="1370.86" dur="9.36">poorest of people just so you can pay</text>
  <text start="1375.81" dur="7.41">for Medicare for all like I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="1380.22" dur="5.04">before this money for this health care</text>
  <text start="1383.22" dur="3.9">the Medicare for all health care system</text>
  <text start="1385.26" dur="4.77">that you&amp;#39;re trying to tout around is the</text>
  <text start="1387.12" dur="5.01">greatest thing since sliced bread it has</text>
  <text start="1390.03" dur="4.02">to come from somewhere someone&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1392.13" dur="6.6">to pay for that because nothing is for</text>
  <text start="1394.05" dur="6.42">free so the American people are going to</text>
  <text start="1398.73" dur="6.66">pay for that they&amp;#39;re going to be forced</text>
  <text start="1400.47" dur="8.13">to pay for it through taxes right which</text>
  <text start="1405.39" dur="6.24">is exactly what opponents to Medicare</text>
  <text start="1408.6" dur="6.27">for all have said this whole time now of</text>
  <text start="1411.63" dur="5.28">course Kamala Harris has said that she</text>
  <text start="1414.87" dur="6.99">is going to raise the 40 trillion</text>
  <text start="1416.91" dur="7.89">dollars by taxing trade stocks but she</text>
  <text start="1421.86" dur="5.42">doesn&amp;#39;t clarify how she&amp;#39;s going to make</text>
  <text start="1424.8" dur="2.48">up the difference</text>
  <text start="1427.52" dur="8.05">now also of note is that Kamala Harris</text>
  <text start="1431.97" dur="5.61">had actually co-sponsored the original</text>
  <text start="1435.57" dur="5.87">bill that Bernie Sanders had put forth</text>
  <text start="1437.58" dur="7.32">for Medicare for all and of course at</text>
  <text start="1441.44" dur="4.84">when she was asked about this because of</text>
  <text start="1444.9" dur="4.11">course you know she&amp;#39;s co-sponsoring</text>
  <text start="1446.28" dur="4.89">Bernie Sanders original bill she is</text>
  <text start="1449.01" dur="6.78">essentially signing on to everything</text>
  <text start="1451.17" dur="8.57">that he had put forth in that bill</text>
  <text start="1455.79" dur="8.49">including taxing middle-class Americans</text>
  <text start="1459.74" dur="8.71">now she says that at the time she had a</text>
  <text start="1464.28" dur="9.84">vision but she really didn&amp;#39;t know how to</text>
  <text start="1468.45" dur="8.31">express that vision um if you are going</text>
  <text start="1474.12" dur="4.35">to be leader of this country you need to</text>
  <text start="1476.76" dur="6.27">be able to think for your</text>

  <text start="1485.549" dur="10.141">to others what you want done so that</text>
  <text start="1493.049" dur="4.921">statement to me really disqualifies you</text>
  <text start="1495.69" dur="4.89">from being a leader because you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1497.97" dur="4.74">know how to lead if you cannot stand on</text>

  <text start="1518.82" dur="5.88">yesterday president Trump signed the 911</text>
  <text start="1522.69" dur="4.83">bill which of course gives compensation</text>
  <text start="1524.7" dur="5.609">to families for those who were affected</text>
  <text start="1527.52" dur="5.25">by you know the 9/11 terrorist attack he</text>
  <text start="1530.309" dur="5.401">invited everyone every member of</text>
  <text start="1532.77" dur="7.289">Congress was invited and no Democrats</text>
  <text start="1535.71" dur="7.4">showed up not a single one of them they</text>
  <text start="1540.059" dur="5.971">continued to show that they hate Trump</text>
  <text start="1543.11" dur="4.33">more than they love this country more</text>
  <text start="1546.03" dur="6.93">than they love the people of this</text>
  <text start="1547.44" dur="7.29">country they continually show that they</text>
  <text start="1552.96" dur="6.57">are willing to cut off their nose to</text>
  <text start="1554.73" dur="7.05">spite their face so they didn&amp;#39;t show up</text>
  <text start="1559.53" dur="4.23">not a single one and also only a few</text>
  <text start="1561.78" dur="3.99">Republicans showed up to this event as</text>
  <text start="1563.76" dur="5.43">well which is a little bit concerning</text>
  <text start="1565.77" dur="5.61">and of course Andrew Cuomo who&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1569.19" dur="5.07">governor of New York was not present at</text>
  <text start="1571.38" dur="8.61">this event nor was mayor of New York</text>
  <text start="1574.26" dur="7.47">City Bill DeBlasio so these are people</text>
  <text start="1579.99" dur="5.79">who you would expect to be at this event</text>
  <text start="1581.73" dur="6.36">because New York City was where this</text>
  <text start="1585.78" dur="5.94">event happened why wouldn&amp;#39;t the mayor of</text>
  <text start="1588.09" dur="6.56">New York City be at this event for his</text>
  <text start="1591.72" dur="7.26">constituents also governor of New York</text>
  <text start="1594.65" dur="6.519">why because they hate Trump so much that</text>
  <text start="1598.98" dur="7.71">they&amp;#39;re not even willing to come and</text>
  <text start="1601.169" dur="7.711">support their own people now I will say</text>
  <text start="1606.69" dur="3.57">something interesting about this and you</text>
  <text start="1608.88" dur="2.909">guys can tell me what you think in the</text>
  <text start="1610.26" dur="5.09">comments below</text>
  <text start="1611.789" dur="3.561">but when it comes to compensation</text>
  <text start="1615.649" dur="9.13">compensation is something that is given</text>
  <text start="1621.139" dur="7.5">from someone who has done something</text>
  <text start="1624.779" dur="3.86">wrong to the person who is wronged</text>
  <text start="1630.889" dur="6.64">compensation is a very interesting</text>
  <text start="1633.179" dur="6.541">language to use in this bill because the</text>
  <text start="1637.529" dur="7.65">narrative that has always been pushed is</text>
  <text start="1639.72" dur="9.539">that this was a terrorist attack however</text>
  <text start="1645.179" dur="6.57">there has been a canoe an extensive</text>
  <text start="1649.259" dur="4.29">amount of evidence that points to the</text>
  <text start="1651.749" dur="5.691">fact that there was at least some</text>
  <text start="1653.549" dur="3.891">involvement from the inside</text>
  <text start="1658.369" dur="8.711">for example the analysis that the way</text>
  <text start="1663.899" dur="8.78">the building went down could only have</text>
  <text start="1667.08" dur="8.219">been done from demolition not a plane</text>
  <text start="1672.679" dur="7.031">there&amp;#39;s been so many things that kind of</text>
  <text start="1675.299" dur="6.81">bring to question whether or not this</text>
  <text start="1679.71" dur="7.849">was partially at least partially an</text>
  <text start="1682.109" dur="10.14">inside job so the language that is used</text>
  <text start="1687.559" dur="7.45">compensation is very interesting and of</text>
  <text start="1692.249" dur="7.35">course President Trump has also been</text>
  <text start="1695.009" dur="6.99">quoted as saying that he thought that</text>
  <text start="1699.599" dur="5.04">the way the building came down had to</text>
  <text start="1701.999" dur="5.221">have been done as a demolition and this</text>
  <text start="1704.639" dur="6.9">was way back when when it originally</text>
  <text start="1707.22" dur="8.36">happened so he&amp;#39;s expressed his</text>
  <text start="1711.539" dur="7.791">skepticism of the mainstream narrative</text>
  <text start="1715.58" dur="9.13">also going on in the background is an</text>
  <text start="1719.33" dur="8.709">investigation into this whole event so</text>
  <text start="1724.71" dur="7.019">it&amp;#39;s interesting that they call this</text>
  <text start="1728.039" dur="6.57">bill compensation because what it</text>
  <text start="1731.729" dur="4.05">implies because the government is the</text>
  <text start="1734.609" dur="4.861">one that&amp;#39;s compensating these</text>
  <text start="1735.779" dur="7.411">individuals what it implies is that the</text>
  <text start="1739.47" dur="5.44">government had wronged these people how</text>
  <text start="1743.19" dur="7.44">do they wronged these people</text>
  <text start="1744.91" dur="8.46">they wronged them by taking part in it</text>
  <text start="1750.63" dur="5.08">maybe I don&amp;#39;t know tell me what you guys</text>
  <text start="1753.37" dur="4.53">think about that because that&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="1755.71" dur="5.91">thought that I have in my mind over this</text>
  <text start="1757.9" dur="5.73">whole this whole in other news this is</text>
  <text start="1761.62" dur="3.84">coming out of the hill McConnell blasts</text>
  <text start="1763.63" dur="4.11">modern-day McCarthyism and defends</text>
  <text start="1765.46" dur="4.2">blocking election bills so Mitch</text>
  <text start="1767.74" dur="4.65">McConnell&amp;#39;s currently under fire for</text>
  <text start="1769.66" dur="4.74">allegedly blocking election security</text>
  <text start="1772.39" dur="4.86">bills but he&amp;#39;s saying that&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="1774.4" dur="7.32">the case so two bills have been put</text>
  <text start="1777.25" dur="7.65">forth one was requiring the usage of</text>
  <text start="1781.72" dur="5.07">paper ballots also the second one had to</text>
  <text start="1784.9" dur="4.14">do with requiring candidates and</text>
  <text start="1786.79" dur="4.59">campaign staffers as well as even family</text>
  <text start="1789.04" dur="5.25">members to report to the FBI if they</text>
  <text start="1791.38" dur="6.08">suspected any foreign assistance now</text>
  <text start="1794.29" dur="5.7">both of these Chuck Schumer and</text>
  <text start="1797.46" dur="5.47">Blumenthal had wanted a unanimous</text>
  <text start="1799.99" dur="6.78">consent and that is why Mitch McConnell</text>
  <text start="1802.93" dur="7.05">had opposed it because requiring a</text>
  <text start="1806.77" dur="6">unanimous consent is not really the way</text>
  <text start="1809.98" dur="7.29">it&amp;#39;s supposed to be so when it comes to</text>
  <text start="1812.77" dur="9.09">voting for bills in passing bills those</text>
  <text start="1817.27" dur="7.56">who vote should have the ability to vote</text>
  <text start="1821.86" dur="4.62">for it or against it any member can vote</text>
  <text start="1824.83" dur="6">for something and any member can vote</text>
  <text start="1826.48" dur="7.2">against it and so that is why you know</text>
  <text start="1830.83" dur="5.43">when you pass a bill you have the</text>
  <text start="1833.68" dur="4.56">majority so the majority if the majority</text>
  <text start="1836.26" dur="3.98">votes yes then it&amp;#39;s passed if the</text>
  <text start="1838.24" dur="6.06">majority votes no then it&amp;#39;s not passed</text>
  <text start="1840.24" dur="6.93">but you know then others have the choice</text>
  <text start="1844.3" dur="5.39">to vote for or against it</text>
  <text start="1847.17" dur="5.91">but this the way that they were trying</text>
  <text start="1849.69" dur="6.45">to put this out there was that in order</text>
  <text start="1853.08" dur="6.21">to pass it it had to have unanimous now</text>
  <text start="1856.14" dur="6.02">I&amp;#39;m thinking especially since Schumer</text>
  <text start="1859.29" dur="6.39">and Blumenthal were behind this is that</text>
  <text start="1862.16" dur="6.37">they knew that there was no way that</text>
  <text start="1865.68" dur="5.34">they were going to get unanimous consent</text>
  <text start="1868.53" dur="6.15">on these bills because everybody has a</text>
  <text start="1871.02" dur="8.85">different opinion so really what that</text>
  <text start="1874.68" dur="8.34">does is that ensures that neither of</text>
  <text start="1879.87" dur="5.19">these bills will pass at all because</text>
  <text start="1883.02" dur="6.84">you&amp;#39;re not going to get unit a unanimous</text>
  <text start="1885.06" dur="7.89">vote so really it&amp;#39;s not Mitch McConnell</text>
  <text start="1889.86" dur="7.74">who was opposing these bills he was</text>
  <text start="1892.95" dur="6.18">Chuck Schumer and Blumenthal but they</text>
  <text start="1897.6" dur="4.77">want people to think that it was Mitch</text>
  <text start="1899.13" dur="5.52">McConnell and of course he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="1902.37" dur="4.68">the Republicans have done quite a bit</text>
  <text start="1904.65" dur="7.08">for election security in fact they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1907.05" dur="7.02">even set aside 380 million three hundred</text>
  <text start="1911.73" dur="6.36">eighty million dollars was offered the</text>
  <text start="1914.07" dur="6.42">states for election security efforts so</text>
  <text start="1918.09" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;ve done quite a bit but the</text>
  <text start="1920.49" dur="4.26">unanimous vote that&amp;#39;s not the way to go</text>
  <text start="1922.29" dur="5.37">and in fact that&amp;#39;s a surefire way to</text>
  <text start="1924.75" dur="5.58">kill a bill which is likely what Chuck</text>
  <text start="1927.66" dur="5.73">Schumer and Blumenthal wanted to do all</text>
  <text start="1930.33" dur="6.6">right and finally in my last bit of news</text>
  <text start="1933.39" dur="5.64">for the day so an update on the Garlic</text>
  <text start="1936.93" dur="4.74">Festival shooting of course I knew there</text>
  <text start="1939.03" dur="5.31">was going to be some kind of narrative</text>
  <text start="1941.67" dur="5.61">that went along with this so apparently</text>
  <text start="1944.34" dur="4.95">the shooter they&amp;#39;re saying who is</text>
  <text start="1947.28" dur="5.61">identified as Santino Williams Leegin</text>
  <text start="1949.29" dur="6.17">who is 19 years old they say that he was</text>
  <text start="1952.89" dur="6.42">posting about white supremacy and</text>
  <text start="1955.46" dur="9.82">massage and miss Augen ISM so it&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="1959.31" dur="9.16">idea that those who are racist and you</text>
  <text start="1965.28" dur="6.91">know misogynist they&amp;#39;re dangerous</text>
  <text start="1968.47" dur="6.18">so this tweet is from an Amanda Duarte</text>
  <text start="1972.19" dur="4.26">and she says the girl Royce shooter has</text>
  <text start="1974.65" dur="3.78">been identified as Santina William</text>
  <text start="1976.45" dur="4.32">league in nineteen his Instagram has</text>
  <text start="1978.43" dur="4.11">just taken down but before it was I saw</text>
  <text start="1980.77" dur="3.78">a post from the festival right before</text>
  <text start="1982.54" dur="4.26">the shooting that said read might is</text>
  <text start="1984.55" dur="4.11">right by ragnar red beard which is a</text>
  <text start="1986.8" dur="5.82">misogynist white power</text>
  <text start="1988.66" dur="5.43">manifesto so of course again they have</text>
  <text start="1992.62" dur="5.43">been saying this whole time that</text>
  <text start="1994.09" dur="8.57">President Trump he really ignites the</text>
  <text start="1998.05" dur="10.1">fire for racism and white supremacy and</text>
  <text start="2002.66" dur="8.38">Miss Augen ISM and xenophobic tendencies</text>
  <text start="2008.15" dur="7.02">even though really if you look at his</text>
  <text start="2011.04" dur="11.07">actions that really doesn&amp;#39;t line up</text>
  <text start="2015.17" dur="9.46">because if he was really racist and was</text>
  <text start="2022.11" dur="6.6">really a white supremacist there is no</text>
  <text start="2024.63" dur="6.39">way that he would ensure that black</text>
  <text start="2028.71" dur="5.58">Americans would benefit in any kind of</text>
  <text start="2031.02" dur="6.06">way from him also he&amp;#39;s supposedly a</text>
  <text start="2034.29" dur="8.37">misogynist yet he has several women in</text>
  <text start="2037.08" dur="9.48">top positions also back in the 80s when</text>
  <text start="2042.66" dur="5.73">he was building Trump Tower the project</text>
  <text start="2046.56" dur="4.53">manager of that was a woman which was</text>
  <text start="2048.39" dur="5.37">unheard of women didn&amp;#39;t hold that</text>
  <text start="2051.09" dur="4.47">position but he gave that job to her</text>
  <text start="2053.76" dur="4.61">because he saw that she had the right</text>
  <text start="2055.56" dur="2.81">amount of skills</text>
  <text start="2059.159" dur="5.291">that does not fit the narrative that</text>
  <text start="2061.419" dur="6">he&amp;#39;s Miss Agnes and also xenophobic he</text>
  <text start="2064.45" dur="5.82">just signed a deal with Guatemala and as</text>
  <text start="2067.419" dur="5.041">a part of that deal more work visas are</text>
  <text start="2070.27" dur="6.27">going to be given to the citizens of</text>
  <text start="2072.46" dur="6.57">that country doesn&amp;#39;t line up with the</text>
  <text start="2076.54" dur="4.579">narrative so they&amp;#39;re trying to push this</text>
  <text start="2079.03" dur="7.7">narrative that President Trump</text>
  <text start="2081.119" dur="9.131">facilitates racism and misogyny and</text>
  <text start="2086.73" dur="5.339">xenophobia and all of this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2090.25" dur="4.169">trying to push the narrative that</text>
  <text start="2092.069" dur="5.651">supporters of Trump are dangerous that</text>
  <text start="2094.419" dur="5.521">they&amp;#39;re all racist and so now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2097.72" dur="5.07">probably what they&amp;#39;re gonna do here is</text>
  <text start="2099.94" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re going to say that those who hold</text>
  <text start="2102.79" dur="5.039">these ideologies are super dangerous and</text>
  <text start="2106.03" dur="4.769">I&amp;#39;ll show you why in just a second oh</text>
  <text start="2107.829" dur="6.691">and archaic by the way oh there are</text>
  <text start="2110.799" dur="5.941">themes of white supremacy and misogyny</text>
  <text start="2114.52" dur="3.23">in this book but they aren&amp;#39;t the central</text>
  <text start="2116.74" dur="4.589">themes</text>
  <text start="2117.75" dur="5.2">although those are the themes that are</text>
  <text start="2121.329" dur="4.051">being focused on in the media when they</text>
  <text start="2122.95" dur="7.05">talk about how this book was associated</text>
  <text start="2125.38" dur="6.27">with the shooter but really the only</text>
  <text start="2130" dur="3.96">reason why those aren&amp;#39;t even mentioned</text>
  <text start="2131.65" dur="4.909">in this book is because the central</text>
  <text start="2133.96" dur="5.119">theme is really superiority over others</text>
  <text start="2136.559" dur="4.421">so of course they express the</text>
  <text start="2139.079" dur="4.51">anglo-saxon race and how it has</text>
  <text start="2140.98" dur="4.879">superiority over other races and how men</text>
  <text start="2143.589" dur="7.411">are superior over women and women are</text>
  <text start="2145.859" dur="8.23">property now the reason why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2151" dur="7.29">pushing those two themes is because they</text>
  <text start="2154.089" dur="5.73">can then ultimately associate that with</text>
  <text start="2158.29" dur="4.22">President Trump and his supporters</text>
  <text start="2159.819" dur="5.79">because of course they&amp;#39;re consistently</text>
  <text start="2162.51" dur="9.03">claiming that President Trump and his</text>
  <text start="2165.609" dur="8.96">supporters are racist and misogynistic</text>
  <text start="2171.54" dur="6">so they&amp;#39;re going to try to claim that</text>
  <text start="2174.569" dur="5.74">those who carry these ideologies are</text>
  <text start="2177.54" dur="7.15">dangerous to the point where they will</text>
  <text start="2180.309" dur="9.121">exact violence in order to demonstrate</text>
  <text start="2184.69" dur="6.25">their superiority over others but really</text>
  <text start="2189.43" dur="8.26">the central theme of this book</text>
  <text start="2190.94" dur="9.599">is an antithesis to morality so is an</text>
  <text start="2197.69" dur="10.44">amoral book it focuses on hedonism and</text>
  <text start="2200.539" dur="11.461">anarchy and really how you have to use</text>
  <text start="2208.13" dur="5.82">physical strength in order to show your</text>
  <text start="2212" dur="5.7">superiority over others to use physical</text>
  <text start="2213.95" dur="6.839">oppression and it&amp;#39;s also cited as being</text>
  <text start="2217.7" dur="6.75">very similar to the book of Satan by</text>
  <text start="2220.789" dur="7.79">Anton LaVey and really that branch of</text>
  <text start="2224.45" dur="6.69">Satanism not necessarily is focused on</text>
  <text start="2228.579" dur="6.25">the worship of Satan but really the</text>
  <text start="2231.14" dur="6.06">worship of themselves so self-service</text>
  <text start="2234.829" dur="8.341">ood doing whatever you want to please</text>
