  <text start="19.94" dur="5.249">have been interested in what I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="21.68" dur="6.78">with my my cryptocurrency stuff my icos</text>
  <text start="25.189" dur="7.021">which just as a recap are basically the</text>
  <text start="28.46" dur="5.49">crypto version of IPOs with the stock</text>
  <text start="32.21" dur="4.59">market like initial public offerings</text>
  <text start="33.95" dur="5.12">very you know the pink slips the very</text>
  <text start="36.8" dur="4.95">high-risk high-reward</text>
  <text start="39.07" dur="4.54">it&amp;#39;s basically a tech startup company</text>
  <text start="41.75" dur="2.94">and with crypto it&amp;#39;s very easy for some</text>
  <text start="43.61" dur="3.69">of them to just run away with your money</text>
  <text start="44.69" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s happened many times so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="47.3" dur="3.9">recommend people do this I just you know</text>
  <text start="49.25" dur="3.3">I let people know what I&amp;#39;m doing because</text>
  <text start="51.2" dur="5.94">there are people out there that are kind</text>
  <text start="52.55" dur="7.59">of following that and curious so about a</text>
  <text start="57.14" dur="7.589">month ago I don&amp;#39;t remember the date they</text>
  <text start="60.14" dur="6.06">deleted all my videos remember I put out</text>
  <text start="64.729" dur="4.89">some videos about some of the moves I</text>
  <text start="66.2" dur="5.64">was making now I made two moves one of</text>
  <text start="69.619" dur="4.561">them was Chrissie OHS and one of those</text>
  <text start="71.84" dur="4.979">was thorn coin now I felt pretty good</text>
  <text start="74.18" dur="5.34">about both of them however since then</text>
  <text start="76.819" dur="4.321">you may have heard you may not have</text>
  <text start="79.52" dur="4.32">heard if you&amp;#39;re in crypto at all or in</text>
  <text start="81.14" dur="6.96">Bitcoin you&amp;#39;ve heard the Bitcoin price</text>
  <text start="83.84" dur="6.15">basically dropped over half now over</text>
  <text start="88.1" dur="7.71">over that long period it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="89.99" dur="8.879">still up many many times right but for a</text>
  <text start="95.81" dur="6.47">new tech startup company that had just</text>
  <text start="98.869" dur="6.721">pulled in all this money in Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="102.28" dur="6.85">because you you buy Bitcoin and then you</text>
  <text start="105.59" dur="6.33">buy into their their IP ICO coin like</text>
  <text start="109.13" dur="5.759">Chrissie OHS coin or thorne coin with</text>
  <text start="111.92" dur="4.979">the Bitcoin and then the the market</text>
  <text start="114.889" dur="3.48">crashed on you know the stock market</text>
  <text start="116.899" dur="3.481">crashed and the Bitcoin price crash</text>
  <text start="118.369" dur="3.81">which with Bitcoin that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s new</text>
  <text start="120.38" dur="3.299">its erratic it happens it goes up and</text>
  <text start="122.179" dur="5.55">down all the time but generally it goes</text>
  <text start="123.679" dur="5.58">up more so and of course every time it</text>
  <text start="127.729" dur="3.181">crashes everybody&amp;#39;s all doom and gloom</text>
  <text start="129.259" dur="4.051">about it but really it&amp;#39;s just part of</text>
  <text start="130.91" dur="4.2">the process i mean i-i i see it as a</text>
  <text start="133.31" dur="4.17">buying opportunity when bitcoin crashes</text>
  <text start="135.11" dur="5.099">but it left these companies in a bad</text>
  <text start="137.48" dur="4.29">place they had just brought in all this</text>
  <text start="140.209" dur="3.901">money and then suddenly they have less</text>
  <text start="141.77" dur="3.28">than half of what they expected to need</text>
  <text start="144.11" dur="9.07">for the</text>
  <text start="145.05" dur="9.42">our startup so it&amp;#39;s amazing I&amp;#39;m just</text>

  <text start="198.63" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s something anyway you can go down</text>
  <text start="202.53" dur="4.4">here to the beds and look at what people</text>
  <text start="203.97" dur="7.41">want to buy this is offers basically and</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="8.8">then over here asks are what people are</text>
  <text start="211.38" dur="6.81">asking for to sell and then last prices</text>
  <text start="215.73" dur="4.47">you know recent transactions so it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="218.19" dur="4.019">Bitcoin notice it&amp;#39;s in vinkle Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="220.2" dur="3.18">you have all these ones and zeros and</text>
  <text start="222.209" dur="4.471">what the hell does that even mean right</text>
  <text start="223.38" dur="8.6">well you can go to Google or anywhere</text>
  <text start="226.68" dur="9.809">else dollar to BTC which is Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="231.98" dur="7.56">you can actually put it in right there</text>
  <text start="236.489" dur="7.201">so we copy paste it over there and the</text>
  <text start="239.54" dur="7.72">the offers the the request to purchase</text>
  <text start="243.69" dur="5.1">are about a dollar 23 now remember they</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="3.27">ended up with less than half of what</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="4.8">they expected now it&amp;#39;s of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="6.329">going back up but that was a kind of a</text>
  <text start="253.59" dur="4.92">major blow for them so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="256.859" dur="3.5">incredible that they are actually still</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="5.46">like I&amp;#39;m profiting like I&amp;#39;m making</text>
  <text start="260.359" dur="5.56">profit I could sell right now at like a</text>
  <text start="263.97" dur="4.05">26 percent or more game you know I</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="3.75">bought in at the the one dollar price</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="3.27">and at the 80 cent price because I</text>
  <text start="269.669" dur="3.631">missed the 50 cent price because if</text>
  <text start="271.29" dur="4.65">those things sold out within like a</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="5.49">second okay you were you were done you</text>
  <text start="275.94" dur="4.59">could not buy in I tried</text>
  <text start="278.79" dur="4.08">was there like it with my coffee early</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="4.02">in the morning ready to go every day and</text>
  <text start="282.87" dur="5.37">it finally like at the third day 80</text>
  <text start="284.55" dur="4.34">cents a coin I got in some so just keep</text>
  <text start="288.24" dur="4.86">in mind</text>
  <text start="288.89" dur="7.12">thorn is of icos thorn is is sort of a</text>
  <text start="293.1" dur="4.32">champion right now it&amp;#39;s of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.01" dur="3.03">still high risk everything else but I</text>
  <text start="297.42" dur="3.63">just wanted to show you guys what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="299.04" dur="4.32">doing and if you&amp;#39;re following it you</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="3.75">know out of curiosity obviously not</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="3.57">financial advice but if you&amp;#39;re following</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="14.54">what I&amp;#39;m doing this is how that you can</text>
  <text start="306.93" dur="12.41">navigate their website let&amp;#39;s go up here</text>
  <text start="321.889" dur="6.9">okay now we&amp;#39;re going to discuss</text>
  <text start="325.55" dur="6.269">long-term versus short-term staking now</text>
  <text start="328.789" dur="4.891">they have they had a lending thing they</text>
  <text start="331.819" dur="4.62">were gonna do like 8% locked-in loans</text>
  <text start="333.68" dur="4.049">they are a dollar locked in value for</text>
  <text start="336.439" dur="3.331">the thing they were gonna do all this</text>
  <text start="337.729" dur="3.99">stuff for lending these companies have</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="4.25">had to reshift and realign their whole</text>
  <text start="341.719" dur="5.281">system now because of what happened so</text>
  <text start="344.02" dur="5.01">now they&amp;#39;re doing just short and long</text>
  <text start="347" dur="5.58">term staking there there&amp;#39;s no more</text>
  <text start="349.03" dur="6.669">lending but staking effectively works in</text>
  <text start="352.58" dur="5.73">a similar way so you&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="355.699" dur="4.5">lending but you&amp;#39;re basically agreeing to</text>
  <text start="358.31" dur="5.55">not use your coins which kind of creates</text>
  <text start="360.199" dur="5.011">a scarcity factor which for them helps</text>
  <text start="363.86" dur="3.54">to drive the price up they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="365.21" dur="4.229">also looking at buying back coins I</text>
  <text start="367.4" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s begun yet but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="369.439" dur="4.38">nadiyah you know generally I would I</text>
  <text start="371.18" dur="5.07">would go into this with a little bit of</text>
  <text start="373.819" dur="4.681">my money and then I would get my money</text>
  <text start="376.25" dur="4.5">back out as soon as I could sell and</text>
  <text start="378.5" dur="3.719">then I would just lend the rest in this</text>
  <text start="380.75" dur="3.029">one I&amp;#39;m actually kind of breaking that</text>
  <text start="382.219" dur="3.211">rule I&amp;#39;m just basically lending</text>
  <text start="383.779" dur="3.781">especially because I want to see them</text>
  <text start="385.43" dur="3.989">succeed so this can be more of a</text>
  <text start="387.56" dur="4.889">long-term thing and they just got hit</text>
  <text start="389.419" dur="4.86">really hard so over in the long-term</text>
  <text start="392.449" dur="6.541">section you&amp;#39;ve got different limits of</text>
  <text start="394.279" dur="8.61">coins the the bonus that you&amp;#39;ll get for</text>
  <text start="398.99" dur="5.669">having you know a larger sum and also it</text>
  <text start="402.889" dur="3.421">will lock it up for less time if you</text>
  <text start="404.659" dur="4.29">have a lot you know like this is if you</text>
  <text start="406.31" dur="3.75">have tons and tons of money and you you</text>
  <text start="408.949" dur="3.69">were in there for many thousands of</text>
  <text start="410.06" dur="4.59">dollars but I&amp;#39;m kind of modest so I only</text>
  <text start="412.639" dur="5.041">have you can see what I have right here</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;ve got a thousand thorn which was</text>
  <text start="417.68" dur="4.259">pretty much the bulk of what I had I put</text>
  <text start="419.27" dur="5.28">that into a long-term stake okay that</text>
  <text start="421.939" dur="4.891">locks it up for 90 to 180 days and I got</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="4.589">a little bit of a bonus the daily</text>
  <text start="426.83" dur="4.109">average of the daily percentage that</text>
  <text start="429.139" dur="3.601">you&amp;#39;ll get it&amp;#39;s just kind of dependent I</text>
  <text start="430.939" dur="5.16">guess on demand or how much they need it</text>
  <text start="432.74" dur="5.699">so they they modify it based on the day</text>
  <text start="436.099" dur="6.72">so whatever day you&amp;#39;re in like today is</text>
  <text start="438.439" dur="7.671">actually really nice to over 2% interest</text>
  <text start="442.819" dur="6.421">rate per day and that&amp;#39;s incredible so</text>
  <text start="446.11" dur="5.859">you know I&amp;#39;m actually gonna go ahead and</text>
  <text start="449.24" dur="4.75">do whatever I have earned so far which</text>
  <text start="451.969" dur="3.611">is paid and thorn and</text>
  <text start="453.99" dur="4.649">I&amp;#39;m just gonna put that back in there</text>
  <text start="455.58" dur="5.91">for another long-term contract so you</text>
  <text start="458.639" dur="6.96">can actually see me do this and then</text>
  <text start="461.49" dur="7.92">down here at the bottom there goes so</text>
  <text start="465.599" dur="5.581">it&amp;#39;s locked in and active so I will be</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="4.409">earning off of that as well like the</text>
  <text start="471.18" dur="7.2">first one I&amp;#39;ve already earned over 125</text>
  <text start="473.819" dur="9.961">foreign which is valued at $1 24 off of</text>
  <text start="478.38" dur="6.84">my thousand okay so you know I got more</text>
  <text start="483.78" dur="3.03">into this one than I did with Chris Yost</text>
  <text start="485.22" dur="5.1">I didn&amp;#39;t have as much with Christos but</text>
  <text start="486.81" dur="5.4">I wanted to to let you guys see that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="490.32" dur="4.2">actually doing this and it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="492.21" dur="3.48">working for me and you know what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="494.52" dur="3">gonna talk about Christie us as well</text>
  <text start="495.69" dur="4.319">because Christos is maybe a complete</text>
  <text start="497.52" dur="5.07">loss maybe not we&amp;#39;ll see and then over</text>
  <text start="500.009" dur="6.061">here there&amp;#39;s also short-term staking</text>
  <text start="502.59" dur="5.34">which does not pay as well but it locks</text>
  <text start="506.07" dur="3.779">it up for a lot less time I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="507.93" dur="3.69">about seven days right now and I think</text>
  <text start="509.849" dur="3.18">I&amp;#39;ve heard that they may be changing</text>
  <text start="511.62" dur="2.969">that soon that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s currently</text>
  <text start="513.029" dur="5.221">disabled they&amp;#39;re doing service term</text>
  <text start="514.589" dur="5.161">updates they may in extend that to like</text>
  <text start="518.25" dur="3.779">more of a month or half a month or</text>
  <text start="519.75" dur="3.899">something like that so basically you</text>
  <text start="522.029" dur="4.141">have long and short-term staking which</text>
  <text start="523.649" dur="4.5">is very similar to lending and you can</text>
  <text start="526.17" dur="3.539">earn interest incredible interest</text>
  <text start="528.149" dur="3.151">because of the nature of crypto</text>
  <text start="529.709" dur="4.741">currencies and icos and the sort of</text>
  <text start="531.3" dur="5.01">profit that they can make you know doing</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="6.3">bot trading and stuff they can have a</text>
  <text start="536.31" dur="6.21">robot that goes and finds for example</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="3.81">Bitcoin or other crypto currencies at</text>
  <text start="542.52" dur="4.68">different prices in two places and they</text>
  <text start="544.56" dur="4.35">can arbitrage that which is basically a</text>
  <text start="547.2" dur="4.05">risk free sort of trade like you see</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="3.96">something for example you saw a silver</text>
  <text start="551.25" dur="8">coin for two dollars and then someone</text>
  <text start="552.87" dur="10.08">else was selling it for 250 and you can</text>
  <text start="559.25" dur="6.61">arbitrage and kind of fill the gap there</text>
  <text start="562.95" dur="4.62">by at the two and sell it like two 49 or</text>
  <text start="565.86" dur="4.14">whatever and then you&amp;#39;ve just made free</text>
  <text start="567.57" dur="5.67">profit basically now they have machine</text>
  <text start="570" dur="4.529">AI that can do that now folks that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="573.24" dur="6">of the things that makes Thorne&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="574.529" dur="6.451">popular so be aware and also I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="579.24" dur="5.01">to talk a little bit about Christo&amp;#39;s now</text>
  <text start="580.98" dur="5.83">with Chrissy os-- they&amp;#39;re paying their</text>
  <text start="584.25" dur="6.52">interests but they are struggling</text>
  <text start="586.81" dur="5.7">okay four actually many days we did not</text>
  <text start="590.77" dur="4.67">even get our interest okay things are</text>
  <text start="592.51" dur="5.94">going a little weak wacky over there but</text>
  <text start="595.44" dur="4.96">their websites still up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="598.45" dur="4.59">still sometimes paying the interest now</text>
  <text start="600.4" dur="4.71">I interest money on a dashboard is not</text>
  <text start="603.04" dur="3.75">really money if it&amp;#39;s on this website</text>
  <text start="605.11" dur="2.13">it&amp;#39;s not cash right it&amp;#39;s not in my</text>

  <text start="609.4" dur="8.22">a dashboard like right now you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="612.61" dur="7.11">earned all these thorn coins but until I</text>
  <text start="617.62" dur="4.74">sell it you know who knows when this</text>
  <text start="619.72" dur="4.95">website&amp;#39;s going under with Chrissie oafs</text>
  <text start="622.36" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s actually basically impossible to</text>
  <text start="624.67" dur="3.12">sell right now they still have their</text>
  <text start="626.17" dur="36.6">price set at fourteen dollars and no</text>
  <text start="627.79" dur="36.69">one&amp;#39;s gonna pay $14.99 they&amp;#39;re setting</text>
  <text start="662.77" dur="4.98">the price and no one&amp;#39;s willing to pay</text>
  <text start="664.48" dur="5.37">their price you know of course we bought</text>
  <text start="667.75" dur="6.18">it at like a dollar dollar forty is what</text>
  <text start="669.85" dur="6.27">I pay dollar forty five so I&amp;#39;m okay with</text>
  <text start="673.93" dur="3.84">what some of the the big guys in this</text>
  <text start="676.12" dur="4.77">field are suggesting which is that they</text>
  <text start="677.77" dur="5.79">drop the price they they do lending and</text>
  <text start="680.89" dur="4.86">they pay interest in Bitcoin rather than</text>
  <text start="683.56" dur="3.99">in Chrissie o scoyne because then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="685.75" dur="3.54">actually earning your interest every day</text>
  <text start="687.55" dur="4.56">and you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about trying</text>
  <text start="689.29" dur="5.01">to sell it and then of course that</text>
  <text start="692.11" dur="5.4">feature of being able to get high</text>
  <text start="694.3" dur="4.86">interest daily in Bitcoin would draw so</text>
  <text start="697.51" dur="3.39">many people to the platform that it</text>
  <text start="699.16" dur="2.82">would help solve their pushes their</text>
  <text start="700.9" dur="2.7">problems their issues that would</text>
  <text start="701.98" dur="4.22">eliminate the problems that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="703.6" dur="5.609">facing because it would flood them with</text>
  <text start="706.2" dur="5.41">an active trading market people would</text>
  <text start="709.209" dur="6.571">want to buy the coins and then those who</text>
  <text start="711.61" dur="6.15">have the coins would be able to sell if</text>
  <text start="715.78" dur="3.27">they want or partially sell like I would</text>
  <text start="717.76" dur="2.04">would I would want to get my money back</text>
  <text start="719.05" dur="2.7">out</text>
  <text start="719.8" dur="3.3">you know and I know that I know that</text>
  <text start="721.75" dur="4.32">some of the people that watch my show</text>
  <text start="723.1" dur="5.04">also got into there so we&amp;#39;re all kind of</text>
  <text start="726.07" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re still sort of waiting we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="728.14" dur="3.84">holding pattern we have to see what</text>
  <text start="729.49" dur="5.969">happens with Chrissie oz we&amp;#39;re hopeful</text>
  <text start="731.98" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re optimistic cautiously but I just</text>
  <text start="735.459" dur="3.091">wanted you guys to be aware I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="736.87" dur="3.24">done any crypto videos in a while and I</text>
  <text start="738.55" dur="3.51">wanted you guys to see that I am</text>
  <text start="740.11" dur="5.159">actually involved just like some of you</text>
  <text start="742.06" dur="4.86">may be and you know I&amp;#39;ve gotten my money</text>
  <text start="745.269" dur="4.951">in this thing as well what little I</text>
  <text start="746.92" dur="4.74">could put in so you know these these</text>
  <text start="750.22" dur="5.07">numbers that you see here</text>
  <text start="751.66" dur="5.52">you know 966 that&amp;#39;s that was a all my</text>
  <text start="755.29" dur="3.6">savings at the time it was like seven</text>
  <text start="757.18" dur="3.779">eight hundred dollars that I had and I</text>
  <text start="758.89" dur="4.41">got a little bit of referral coins as</text>
  <text start="760.959" dur="4.291">well like when a couple people used my</text>
  <text start="763.3" dur="3.779">link and they bought in and you know</text>
  <text start="765.25" dur="4.62">they have a like a I think it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="767.079" dur="7.291">five percent or something referral as</text>
  <text start="769.87" dur="6.899">well so this is a catch-up just an</text>
  <text start="774.37" dur="4.77">update on what&amp;#39;s going on of course</text>
  <text start="776.769" dur="5.241">Bitcoin is going back up it always does</text>
  <text start="779.14" dur="5.88">and then next year it&amp;#39;ll probably be a</text>
  <text start="782.01" dur="4.72">$50,000 a Bitcoin and all those people</text>
  <text start="785.02" dur="4.68">that said it all it crashed it&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="786.73" dur="4.38">for it was a it was a bubble you know</text>
  <text start="789.7" dur="3.87">those people are always proven wrong</text>
  <text start="791.11" dur="4.229">with Bitcoin you know it went from</text>
  <text start="793.57" dur="4.17">pennies to dollars and then it went from</text>
  <text start="795.339" dur="4.321">dollars to hundreds of dollars and then</text>
  <text start="797.74" dur="3.69">it went from hundreds of dollars to like</text>
  <text start="799.66" dur="3.57">three thousand dollars I think that was</text>
  <text start="801.43" dur="4.08">last year not even that long ago and</text>
  <text start="803.23" dur="2.78">then he went to eighteen thousand</text>
  <text start="805.51" dur="3.389">dollars</text>
  <text start="806.01" dur="4.99">now folks for those who think that this</text>
  <text start="808.899" dur="5.13">is a bubble or some kind of crazy thing</text>
  <text start="811" dur="6.69">remember that this is a contender for</text>
  <text start="814.029" dur="6.091">money all right and for money the actual</text>
  <text start="817.69" dur="5.31">like market cap like the the demand out</text>
  <text start="820.12" dur="5.159">there for money if we were to even make</text>
  <text start="823" dur="4.35">a dent and the dollars a usage with</text>
  <text start="825.279" dur="4.261">Bitcoin and take just a little bit of</text>
  <text start="827.35" dur="3.87">that market share away then Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="829.54" dur="3.45">could be a million dollars a coin there</text>
  <text start="831.22" dur="4.619">is so much upward mobility there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="832.99" dur="5.25">much upward opportunity and potential</text>
  <text start="835.839" dur="4.68">that we&amp;#39;re definitely not in a bubble</text>
  <text start="838.24" dur="4.17">and then that&amp;#39;s without even comparing</text>
  <text start="840.519" dur="3.301">the the the benefits and the pros and</text>
  <text start="842.41" dur="4.2">cons because I did a video a while back</text>
  <text start="843.82" dur="4.829">I think I have it reloaded on Vimeo now</text>
  <text start="846.61" dur="3.719">if you want to watch it it talks about</text>
  <text start="848.649" dur="4.621">crypto is how they can end the central</text>
  <text start="850.329" dur="4.431">bank okay and I compared gold I</text>
  <text start="853.27" dur="4.38">haier cryptos and I compare dollars</text>
  <text start="854.76" dur="6.04">alright now it&amp;#39;s important to understand</text>
  <text start="857.65" dur="5.88">that even if you think gold is a better</text>
  <text start="860.8" dur="6.3">form of money than Kryptos which you</text>
  <text start="863.53" dur="5.25">know I was a Gold Bug for the entire</text>
  <text start="867.1" dur="3.75">time Bitcoin was out until last year</text>
  <text start="868.78" dur="3.63">okay I was like oh that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="870.85" dur="3.24">but I still like gold and silver more I</text>
  <text start="872.41" dur="3.18">like to be able to hold it it&amp;#39;s shiny</text>
  <text start="874.09" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s pretty I can barter with it no</text>
  <text start="875.59" dur="5.1">matter what I can bury it but then I</text>
  <text start="878.35" dur="5.79">learned more about crypto okay I learned</text>
  <text start="880.69" dur="5.82">that it&amp;#39;s completely if you do it</text>
  <text start="884.14" dur="4.29">intelligently it&amp;#39;s safe it&amp;#39;s anonymous</text>
  <text start="886.51" dur="3.87">and no one can manipulate it or take it</text>
  <text start="888.43" dur="3.26">from you you can hide your money in your</text>
  <text start="890.38" dur="4.35">own memory like you could actually</text>
  <text start="891.69" dur="5.23">destroy the laptop or whatever and then</text>
  <text start="894.73" dur="3.99">memorize a code and have billions of</text>
  <text start="896.92" dur="3.57">dollars in your brain no one could ever</text>
  <text start="898.72" dur="3.45">take that from you you could travel to</text>
  <text start="900.49" dur="4.41">Egypt or wherever you want to go and</text>
  <text start="902.17" dur="4.92">then type in your password again and</text>
  <text start="904.9" dur="5.64">have all your money okay this stuff is</text>
  <text start="907.09" dur="7.44">the ultimate money compared to even gold</text>
  <text start="910.54" dur="6.98">and even silver in my opinion not only</text>
  <text start="914.53" dur="6">for the anonymity you know and for the</text>
  <text start="917.52" dur="4.93">immunity to manipulation which even gold</text>
  <text start="920.53" dur="3.51">and silver that&amp;#39;s the problems with them</text>
  <text start="922.45" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re manipulated like crazy</text>
  <text start="924.04" dur="4.77">every time the price of silver and gold</text>
  <text start="926.35" dur="6">and go up they print up a bunch of paper</text>
  <text start="928.81" dur="5.13">gold and silver contracts ETFs and they</text>
  <text start="932.35" dur="3.54">flood the market and drive the price</text>
  <text start="933.94" dur="4.5">back down you know if you buy gold and</text>
  <text start="935.89" dur="5.1">silver paper like if you on paper on it</text>
  <text start="938.44" dur="6.27">you have no actual gold and silver and</text>
  <text start="940.99" dur="6.09">if anyone tries to call that do you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="944.71" dur="4.17">screwed because only like the first part</text>
  <text start="947.08" dur="3.12">1% or less will get their actual</text>
  <text start="948.88" dur="3.69">physical gold and silver everybody else</text>
  <text start="950.2" dur="4.02">is just out and you know people have</text>
  <text start="952.57" dur="2.94">been arrested for the bank fraud going</text>
  <text start="954.22" dur="4.92">on with the silver and gold markets</text>
  <text start="955.51" dur="6.09">recently major banks have been fined for</text>
  <text start="959.14" dur="4.92">for the manipulation on the gold and</text>
  <text start="961.6" dur="4.38">silver fix so this is not me saying this</text>
  <text start="964.06" dur="4.5">is this is serious and any gold silver</text>
  <text start="965.98" dur="4.2">investor or person who&amp;#39;s been watching</text>
  <text start="968.56" dur="3.3">that market for a long time can tell you</text>
  <text start="970.18" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re all just kind of sitting on</text>
  <text start="971.86" dur="4.5">their hoard hoping that the this you</text>
  <text start="973.87" dur="4.92">know the physical metal is finally ran</text>
  <text start="976.36" dur="4.95">out you know like if if the day comes</text>
  <text start="978.79" dur="4.5">when no one can get any physical then</text>
  <text start="981.31" dur="3.99">the paper money that the paper silver</text>
  <text start="983.29" dur="5.01">and gold will go through the</text>
  <text start="985.3" dur="5.25">roof and be insane of course because now</text>
  <text start="988.3" dur="3.78">people know the jig is up but as long as</text>
  <text start="990.55" dur="3.599">the physical still there and they can</text>
  <text start="992.08" dur="3.54">still deliver some coins to the small</text>
  <text start="994.149" dur="3.831">percentage of investors that actually</text>
  <text start="995.62" dur="6.48">buy a physical then that&amp;#39;s what happens</text>
