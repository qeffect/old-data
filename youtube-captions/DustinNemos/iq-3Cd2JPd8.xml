  <text start="2.58" dur="3.299">know that you know sometimes Q&amp;#39;s watch</text>
  <text start="4.259" dur="3.301">my stuff in the past I don&amp;#39;t know if he</text>
  <text start="5.879" dur="4.01">still does but if there&amp;#39;s no other</text>
  <text start="7.56" dur="5.55">message that I would like to at least</text>
  <text start="9.889" dur="6.071">get to his ear to Trump&amp;#39;s ear than this</text>
  <text start="13.11" dur="5.58">and I hope to meet Trump one day I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="15.96" dur="3.84">missed opportunities too but a pheasant</text>
  <text start="18.69" dur="8.19">my daughter was born it&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="19.8" dur="9.45">reason but the only thing I think that I</text>
  <text start="26.88" dur="4.739">would say to Q if I could if I could get</text>
  <text start="29.25" dur="5.07">his ear for just a second or Trump or</text>
  <text start="31.619" dur="6.21">any leader who was honest you know there</text>
  <text start="34.32" dur="5.88">are others especially now is please</text>
  <text start="37.829" dur="4.261">please please please don&amp;#39;t make the</text>
  <text start="40.2" dur="3.42">historic mistake the same mistake that</text>
  <text start="42.09" dur="5.19">other leaders in the past like the</text>
  <text start="43.62" dur="5.88">founders of our country have made don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="6.18">leave the government alive destroy the</text>
  <text start="49.5" dur="5.61">whole thing and it sounds crazy you know</text>
  <text start="53.46" dur="3.36">the whole concept of anarchy is that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="55.11" dur="3.15">what the a the anti foot is out there</text>
  <text start="56.82" dur="3.75">doing violence call themselves and</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s not what it really is but um</text>
  <text start="60.57" dur="3.27">every time that you have a government</text>
  <text start="62.25" dur="3.72">even the smallest tiniest government in</text>
  <text start="63.84" dur="4.86">the world like the original you know</text>
  <text start="65.97" dur="4.71">u.s. constitutional republic you always</text>
  <text start="68.7" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s a seed it always grows back into</text>
  <text start="70.68" dur="4.91">this big thing most of that sort of</text>
  <text start="73.65" dur="4.5">corrupting influence and power goes away</text>
  <text start="75.59" dur="4.3">if you have no governments it&amp;#39;s anarchy</text>
  <text start="78.15" dur="4.38">is literally translated to rule without</text>
  <text start="79.89" dur="3.75">rulers because it&amp;#39;s still organized you</text>
  <text start="82.53" dur="3.12">can still have everything you have now</text>
  <text start="83.64" dur="4.74">like courts and and even cops and stuff</text>
  <text start="85.65" dur="5.399">you can do all of that but imagine if</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="3.84">the local sheriff became corrupt imagine</text>
  <text start="91.049" dur="2.46">if there were six or seven or eight</text>
  <text start="92.22" dur="3.09">different alternatives that you could</text>
  <text start="93.509" dur="3.9">shop around for through the free market</text>
  <text start="95.31" dur="4.5">okay that could be done and that can</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="4.71">even be done in a way that is far more</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="3.629">checked and balanced and and transparent</text>
  <text start="102.119" dur="3.691">than what we have now same with the</text>
  <text start="103.439" dur="4.201">prison systems a lot of these things</text>
  <text start="105.81" dur="3.39">these sort of private industries even</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="3.18">the private industry now the prison</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="3.72">industrial complex are so corrupt</text>
  <text start="110.82" dur="4.619">because of government&amp;#39;s involvement</text>
  <text start="112.92" dur="5.28">I don&amp;#39;t like prisons I don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="115.439" dur="4.381">even know that we need them forever I</text>
  <text start="118.2" dur="3.239">think eventually we may be able to to</text>
  <text start="119.82" dur="4.5">sort of evolve away from that particular</text>
  <text start="121.439" dur="4.82">need especially if we Institute the</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="4.35">death penalty for certain things but</text>
  <text start="126.259" dur="4.12">like self-defense basically should be</text>
  <text start="128.67" dur="3.21">just allowed and that would eliminate</text>
  <text start="130.379" dur="5.221">the need for the death penalty</text>
  <text start="131.88" dur="6.63">as a rule but um generally I think that</text>
  <text start="135.6" dur="5.22">we could get to a world where there are</text>
  <text start="138.51" dur="5.55">free market alternatives to everything</text>
  <text start="140.82" dur="4.56">which is cheaper faster better in every</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="5.97">way more efficient better for the</text>
  <text start="145.38" dur="8.54">environment more balanced more moral all</text>
  <text start="150.03" dur="3.89">of those things could be done I think</text>
  <text start="154.43" dur="4.15">relatively quickly I mean just</text>
  <text start="156.81" dur="3.69">capitalism can free people from poverty</text>
  <text start="158.58" dur="4.26">verify overnight guys if you let it</text>
  <text start="160.5" dur="4.23">really unleash but capitalism as</text>
  <text start="162.84" dur="5.01">rothbard said cannot exist with</text>
  <text start="164.73" dur="5.04">government it can it can have more</text>
  <text start="167.85" dur="5.7">market share it can have more sort of on</text>
  <text start="169.77" dur="6.6">the spectrum but it can never really</text>
  <text start="173.55" dur="4.02">exist in its true natural state because</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="2.97">the government always interferes with</text>
  <text start="177.57" dur="4.2">the market in some way or the incentive</text>
  <text start="179.34" dur="3.84">structure or the power system the way</text>
  <text start="181.77" dur="4.11">that people make decisions which is</text>
  <text start="183.18" dur="5.64">always impacted by that or they just</text>
  <text start="185.88" dur="5.94">take over the money supply or delegate</text>
  <text start="188.82" dur="4.17">it to evil private banks which is half</text>
  <text start="191.82" dur="3.66">you know the money&amp;#39;s half of every</text>
  <text start="192.99" dur="5.79">transaction and stuff to that end I</text>
  <text start="195.48" dur="5.25">actually I&amp;#39;m hoping to create an</text>
  <text start="198.78" dur="6">alternative to all of these major tech</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="7.77">systems hopefully all-in-one eBay Amazon</text>
  <text start="204.78" dur="7.85">Google all of it one that will be as</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="6.78">much as possible open-source free market</text>
  <text start="212.63" dur="6.22">allows all of the options Kryptos</text>
  <text start="215.28" dur="8.43">currencies credit cards metals</text>
  <text start="218.85" dur="7.05">everything to be transacted and allows</text>
  <text start="223.71" dur="4.2">people to list their wares in an eBay</text>
  <text start="225.9" dur="4.47">sorta format with the reviews and such</text>
  <text start="227.91" dur="4.08">for honesty and stuff but I think this</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="4.56">would allow there to be a sort of a</text>
  <text start="231.99" dur="4.59">Patriot alternative and that kind of a</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="7.2">business wouldn&amp;#39;t have to make much</text>
  <text start="236.58" dur="7.53">money it could be largely sort of maybe</text>
  <text start="242.13" dur="4.29">like I guess maintained was some sort of</text>
  <text start="244.11" dur="5.52">minimal ads or some or some small fee or</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="5.13">something but wouldn&amp;#39;t need a lot it</text>
  <text start="249.63" dur="3.3">would not need a lot because it could it</text>
  <text start="251.55" dur="2.88">could probably even be ran as a</text>
  <text start="252.93" dur="3.3">non-profit and just have enough to</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="5.309">maintain all the like the server data</text>
  <text start="256.23" dur="4.59">and stuff because really ideally you</text>
  <text start="259.739" dur="2.861">want that kind of business to be</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="3.52">decentralized so they can&amp;#39;t take it down</text>
  <text start="262.6" dur="5.7">and I know I&amp;#39;m kind of going off on a</text>
  <text start="264.34" dur="6.15">tangent here I need to actually get this</text>
  <text start="268.3" dur="5.46">out of my mind while I&amp;#39;m thinking about</text>
  <text start="270.49" dur="6.66">it still because I think this could give</text>
  <text start="273.76" dur="5.96">us a way to attack and hear me out on</text>
  <text start="277.15" dur="5.64">this companies like Amazon Google etc</text>
  <text start="279.72" dur="4.66">not just to withdraw our consent and</text>
  <text start="282.79" dur="3.45">withdraw you know our productivity and</text>
  <text start="284.38" dur="4.47">our dollars from them voting with our</text>
  <text start="286.24" dur="5.63">dollar but a way to do so that is</text>
  <text start="288.85" dur="5.43">bulletproof and will spread virally</text>
  <text start="291.87" dur="3.88">which means it can&amp;#39;t be like a huge</text>
  <text start="294.28" dur="3">moneymaker for somebody like I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="295.75" dur="3.54">trying to just get rich off this idea</text>
  <text start="297.28" dur="7.2">I&amp;#39;m not trying to do in Amazon I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="299.29" dur="6.84">trying to do more of like a yum what do</text>
  <text start="304.48" dur="6.24">they call it like a Silk Road was on the</text>
  <text start="306.13" dur="6.6">black the dark web well deep dark</text>
  <text start="310.72" dur="3.9">whatever depends on how you ask</text>
  <text start="312.73" dur="4.62">but without the drug drugs and stuff it</text>
  <text start="314.62" dur="5.46">would be decentralized but within the</text>
  <text start="317.35" dur="3.99">bounds of like the law of course so it</text>
  <text start="320.08" dur="5.91">could be maintained it can be on the</text>
  <text start="321.34" dur="6.6">open Internet but it would be kind of an</text>
  <text start="325.99" dur="3.18">eBay and Amazon all of those different</text>
  <text start="327.94" dur="4.68">things you could you could put your</text>
  <text start="329.17" dur="5.87">business in there you could interact in</text>
  <text start="332.62" dur="2.42">that way</text>
