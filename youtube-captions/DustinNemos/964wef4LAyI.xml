  <text start="531.079" dur="3.781">Trump is doing he seems to be going very</text>
  <text start="532.579" dur="5.88">aggressive especially against China</text>
  <text start="534.86" dur="5.01">I mean he&amp;#39;s ordering people to stop</text>
  <text start="538.459" dur="3.18">doing business with China and literally</text>
  <text start="539.87" dur="3.81">on Twitter I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="541.639" dur="4.95">an official order or anything but it</text>
  <text start="543.68" dur="4.589">sounded pretty darn compelling to me so</text>
  <text start="546.589" dur="5.821">if you&amp;#39;re buying anything from China</text>
  <text start="548.269" dur="8.01">try not to it&amp;#39;s time to shop Patriot</text>
  <text start="552.41" dur="5.34">which is actually coincidentally perfect</text>
  <text start="556.279" dur="3.93">because I&amp;#39;m starting the white hat</text>
  <text start="557.75" dur="4.649">movement around the concept of working</text>
  <text start="560.209" dur="4.771">together and Patriots shopping patriot</text>
  <text start="562.399" dur="4.86">and you guys have heard me talk about it</text>
  <text start="564.98" dur="4.62">before probably a hundred times but you</text>
  <text start="567.259" dur="4.231">know patriot businesses can fund truth</text>
  <text start="569.6" dur="3.51">media which is best desperately needed</text>
  <text start="571.49" dur="5.039">right now because we&amp;#39;ve been demonetized</text>
  <text start="573.11" dur="7.079">completely and without companies that</text>
  <text start="576.529" dur="5.971">stand with us to fund truth media we go</text>
  <text start="580.189" dur="4.441">under or we we live on a subsistence</text>
  <text start="582.5" dur="4.05">level and we&amp;#39;re not very effective</text>
  <text start="584.63" dur="3.899">journalists and we&amp;#39;re going up against</text>
  <text start="586.55" dur="5.58">these multi-billion dollar you know</text>
  <text start="588.529" dur="5.881">megalithic structures that are kind of</text>
  <text start="592.13" dur="4.639">slow but if they&amp;#39;re censoring us we have</text>
  <text start="594.41" dur="2.359">no shot</text>
  <text start="603.53" dur="7.26">overstock CEO well it brings up an</text>
  <text start="608.22" dur="4.97">interesting point with his sort of I</text>
  <text start="610.79" dur="5.56">have dirt on the whole darn thing</text>
  <text start="613.19" dur="6.22">comments I mean he he was able to bring</text>
  <text start="616.35" dur="5.37">out Rubio and Cruz which we already knew</text>
  <text start="619.41" dur="5.61">about through q and on into the the</text>
  <text start="621.72" dur="6.66">whole face of you stuff I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="625.02" dur="4.83">gotta be really and he does it in a way</text>
  <text start="628.38" dur="3.75">that he was a victim of this as well</text>
  <text start="629.85" dur="3.33">like he was in on it right but he was a</text>
  <text start="632.13" dur="3">victim because he thought it was</text>
  <text start="633.18" dur="4.56">legitimate government</text>
  <text start="635.13" dur="4.68">you know just his operation sure I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="637.74" dur="4.83">help with doing some sort of justice</text>
  <text start="639.81" dur="5.4">bring some bad guys down and then he</text>
  <text start="642.57" dur="4.68">apparently realized that he was spying</text>
  <text start="645.21" dur="5.82">on people illegitimately and part of a</text>
  <text start="647.25" dur="5.7">coup so now he&amp;#39;s coming out to say it</text>
  <text start="651.03" dur="3.39">and apparently he&amp;#39;s had to step down</text>
  <text start="652.95" dur="4.85">from his company so he&amp;#39;s gonna have a</text>
  <text start="654.42" dur="3.38">lot more free time to talk about it</text>

  <text start="1031.589" dur="3.691">don&amp;#39;t work out enough I&amp;#39;ve started to</text>
  <text start="1033.27" dur="3.48">try to get back into the gym now I just</text>
  <text start="1035.28" dur="3.21">got out of it for the last two years</text>
  <text start="1036.75" dur="4.199">it&amp;#39;s been like literally 17 hour days</text>
  <text start="1038.49" dur="5.219">sometimes it&amp;#39;s just insane and then</text>
  <text start="1040.949" dur="5.701">beyond that you know I started to kind</text>
  <text start="1043.709" dur="5.761">of just get back into shape and carbon</text>
  <text start="1046.65" dur="5.899">60 is pretty amazing and I do struggle</text>
  <text start="1049.47" dur="7.38">with sugar sometimes but other than that</text>
  <text start="1052.549" dur="10">for the most part I&amp;#39;m healthy basically</text>
  <text start="1056.85" dur="7.88">I have a sugar problem but I quit soda</text>
  <text start="1062.549" dur="8.491">like years ago and I basically just like</text>
  <text start="1064.73" dur="8.14">like fruits and stuff now yeah diet is</text>
  <text start="1071.04" dur="3.3">eric says inflammation is probably the</text>
  <text start="1072.87" dur="5.28">biggest cause of health issues diet is</text>
  <text start="1074.34" dur="5.64">very important I agree but you know</text>
  <text start="1078.15" dur="3.72">inflammations every health issue for the</text>
  <text start="1079.98" dur="3.78">most part but what&amp;#39;s causing it right</text>
  <text start="1081.87" dur="3.439">there&amp;#39;s a hundred or a thousand</text>
  <text start="1083.76" dur="5.01">different things and then diet is</text>
  <text start="1085.309" dur="5.831">usually the solution to most of them but</text>
  <text start="1088.77" dur="4.86">even in your diet for example you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1091.14" dur="5.64">get enough greens from eating just</text>
  <text start="1093.63" dur="6.03">period can&amp;#39;t do it you have to chew all</text>
  <text start="1096.78" dur="5.49">day every day and you probably be tired</text>
  <text start="1099.66" dur="6.18">of that like like a cow chewing cud or</text>
  <text start="1102.27" dur="6.45">something so you almost have to do</text>
  <text start="1105.84" dur="5.219">smoothies or juicing but then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1108.72" dur="5.73">running the risk of you know too much</text>
  <text start="1111.059" dur="5.191">sugar so it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s everywhere in</text>
  <text start="1114.45" dur="6.05">our diet already even fruit then becomes</text>
  <text start="1116.25" dur="4.25">unhealthy because just more sugar</text>
  <text start="1123.04" dur="3.63">so some people are just against</text>
  <text start="1125.35" dur="3.39">supplements saying just get it all</text>
  <text start="1126.67" dur="5.46">through your food and things like that</text>
  <text start="1128.74" dur="4.77">and some are saying you know maybe you</text>
  <text start="1132.13" dur="3.84">have to supplement certain things but</text>
  <text start="1133.51" dur="6.23">sugar is basically just a 100 percent</text>
  <text start="1135.97" dur="6">toxic and there&amp;#39;s nothing good about it</text>
  <text start="1139.74" dur="6.13">unless you want to farm ants or</text>
  <text start="1141.97" dur="5.49">something and by the way the reason I</text>
  <text start="1145.87" dur="3.03">had that sugar problem is because my</text>
  <text start="1147.46" dur="3.42">parents and grandparents gave me a ton</text>
  <text start="1148.9" dur="11.73">of candy as a kid and I grew up kind of</text>
  <text start="1150.88" dur="13.02">addicted to it so it&amp;#39;s been like this</text>
  <text start="1160.63" dur="6.18">this journey from sugary child to sort</text>
  <text start="1163.9" dur="6.33">of ketogenic more healthy minded at</text>
  <text start="1166.81" dur="5.16">least man and watching what Big Pharma</text>
  <text start="1170.23" dur="4.26">has done to my family personally like</text>
  <text start="1171.97" dur="5.13">you know for those who yes I saw there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1174.49" dur="4.35">a few new people so for example my</text>
  <text start="1177.1" dur="3.54">grandfather died of cancer my</text>
  <text start="1178.84" dur="4.89">grandmother has it and kind of fighting</text>
  <text start="1180.64" dur="4.65">it probably you know on the way out soon</text>
  <text start="1183.73" dur="5">most of her family are now dead of</text>
  <text start="1185.29" dur="5.67">cancer so all my extended family their</text>
  <text start="1188.73" dur="3.7">dad&amp;#39;s not in great shape because they</text>
  <text start="1190.96" dur="3.18">put him on statin drugs when he was</text>
  <text start="1192.43" dur="3.69">pretty young no point for that</text>
  <text start="1194.14" dur="4.35">cholesterol is good for you</text>
  <text start="1196.12" dur="4.95">for the most part you&amp;#39;d have to be</text>
  <text start="1198.49" dur="4.17">pretty much morbidly obese to have too</text>
  <text start="1201.07" dur="4.92">much cholesterol it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s your brains</text>
  <text start="1202.66" dur="4.8">made of but statin drugs they just keep</text>
  <text start="1205.99" dur="3.36">lower in that level of acceptable</text>
  <text start="1207.46" dur="5.37">cholesterol so they raise how many</text>
  <text start="1209.35" dur="5.49">statin drugs they sell while painting a</text>
  <text start="1212.83" dur="4.74">tree that that does the same thing as a</text>
  <text start="1214.84" dur="6.81">statin drug that&amp;#39;s much safer and anyway</text>
  <text start="1217.57" dur="7.44">I digress also turned my mother brother</text>
  <text start="1221.65" dur="6.08">and sister into prostitutes with heroin</text>
  <text start="1225.01" dur="8.43">and all that other shit on the streets</text>
  <text start="1227.73" dur="7.99">so I don&amp;#39;t like Big Pharma and I really</text>
  <text start="1233.44" dur="4.76">do believe in holistic health and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1235.72" dur="6.33">seen kind of both ends of it</text>
  <text start="1238.2" dur="8.26">I&amp;#39;ve lived in an eco village kind of an</text>
  <text start="1242.05" dur="7.29">organic non vaccines eco village and</text>
  <text start="1246.46" dur="5.52">then I&amp;#39;ve lived in a you know hot</text>
  <text start="1249.34" dur="5.7">pockets and pop-tarts and and pancakes</text>
  <text start="1251.98" dur="5.18">and and sodas I would drink six liters</text>
  <text start="1255.04" dur="5.96">of Mountain Dew some nights</text>
  <text start="1257.16" dur="6.4">you know I had a bunch of cavities and</text>
  <text start="1261" dur="4.54">then on top of the the cavities like I</text>
  <text start="1263.56" dur="6.18">had eight cavities so on top of the</text>
  <text start="1265.54" dur="6.39">cavities they put in the silver amalgams</text>
  <text start="1269.74" dur="4.29">the mercury stuff so then later I found</text>
  <text start="1271.93" dur="4.34">out that&amp;#39;s basically just poisonous and</text>
  <text start="1274.03" dur="6.33">it&amp;#39;s emitting a mercury vapor constantly</text>
  <text start="1276.27" dur="5.02">and it there&amp;#39;s a video of it actually</text>
  <text start="1280.36" dur="2.61">where you can see it under a certain</text>
  <text start="1281.29" dur="4.35">spectrum of light and with a real tooth</text>
  <text start="1282.97" dur="6.75">and it just says sir poisoning you the</text>
  <text start="1285.64" dur="5.64">rest of your life anyway yeah and you</text>
  <text start="1289.72" dur="2.73">can&amp;#39;t take glutathione if you get that</text>
  <text start="1291.28" dur="2.85">in your mouth because that&amp;#39;s just gonna</text>
  <text start="1292.45" dur="3.77">pull it right into your organs cuz will</text>
  <text start="1294.13" dur="4.83">it fly out just sucks up mercury</text>
  <text start="1296.22" dur="5.38">anyway so I had all of those removed and</text>
  <text start="1298.96" dur="6.27">put in and replace with porcelain one of</text>
  <text start="1301.6" dur="6.75">the teeth died and then I had that one</text>
  <text start="1305.23" dur="6">root root canal then I realized Oh root</text>
  <text start="1308.35" dur="4.2">canals actually toxic lead um bacteria</text>
  <text start="1311.23" dur="5.19">into your heart the rest your life and</text>
  <text start="1312.55" dur="6.96">pretty much guarantee a heart attack so</text>
  <text start="1316.42" dur="5.52">I had to get that one pulled out all of</text>
  <text start="1319.51" dur="4.5">this because my my folks gave me too</text>
  <text start="1321.94" dur="6.12">much cancer alright not too much sugar</text>
  <text start="1324.01" dur="6.29">as a child and that&amp;#39;s a darn hard habit</text>
  <text start="1328.06" dur="2.24">to kick</text>
  <text start="1330.87" dur="4.57">and if you do by the way get those</text>
  <text start="1333.22" dur="3.6">things pulled out there are dentists</text>
  <text start="1335.44" dur="3.74">that are trained to do this the right</text>
  <text start="1336.82" dur="4.53">way did you guys know that the highest</text>
  <text start="1339.18" dur="4.87">industry where there&amp;#39;s infertility among</text>
  <text start="1341.35" dur="4.83">women is the dental assistant because</text>
  <text start="1344.05" dur="3.81">they are so much mercury in the air now</text>
  <text start="1346.18" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s changing a lot now it&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="1347.86" dur="3.21">just dropped completely because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1349.6" dur="4.38">stopped using the amalgams almost</text>
  <text start="1351.07" dur="4.74">everywhere the silver stuff but when</text>
  <text start="1353.98" dur="4.38">they did use that and even if they</text>
  <text start="1355.81" dur="4.67">remove them now in most places they</text>
  <text start="1358.36" dur="4.38">drill and they dump it into a closet</text>
  <text start="1360.48" dur="5.02">trashcan where the vacuum just kind of</text>
  <text start="1362.74" dur="6.42">dumps it&amp;#39;s in the air mercury powder</text>
  <text start="1365.5" dur="5.28">everywhere it&amp;#39;s very toxic so if you do</text>
  <text start="1369.16" dur="3.39">get this done make sure that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1370.78" dur="4.55">going to someone who&amp;#39;s been trained to</text>
  <text start="1372.55" dur="5.97">remove mercury from your mouth safely</text>
  <text start="1375.33" dur="9.13">it&amp;#39;s not a fun thing to have to go</text>
  <text start="1378.52" dur="8.07">through and then once you&amp;#39;re done with</text>
  <text start="1384.46" dur="4.02">it you can start looking at ulation and</text>
  <text start="1386.59" dur="3.049">and kind of getting the heavy metals out</text>

  <text start="2924.469" dur="12.72">it&amp;#39;s a cool concept people should do</text>
