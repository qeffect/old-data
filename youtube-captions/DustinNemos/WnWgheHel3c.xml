  <text start="41.129" dur="6.301">you&amp;#39;re fine audience any time we want to</text>
  <text start="44.85" dur="4.229">talk about the potential identity of the</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="4.32">whistleblower that everyone&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="49.079" dur="4.171">curious about right now my only question</text>
  <text start="51.75" dur="3.96">is how long is it going to be until a</text>
  <text start="53.25" dur="7.559">they suicide with two bullets to the</text>
  <text start="55.71" dur="8.489">back of the head or something so well I</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="5.13">think this is the beginning here is</text>
  <text start="64.199" dur="4.081">laying in state as we speak</text>
  <text start="65.939" dur="4.021">and QS already referenced it in one of</text>
  <text start="68.28" dur="4.26">the drops as far as you know like a</text>
  <text start="69.96" dur="5.04">touchet and you know I can move and</text>
  <text start="72.54" dur="4.439">counter move so you know this is this is</text>
  <text start="75" dur="5.549">part of the unfolding thing that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="5.82">experienced this whole year is changing</text>
  <text start="80.549" dur="4.051">timelines and going with the flow I know</text>
  <text start="82.799" dur="3.691">we talked about it before is that you</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="3.6">have plans that POTUS is going to take</text>
  <text start="86.49" dur="3.989">off on a helicopter in that morning it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="88.2" dur="3.629">raining and even if you know doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="3.301">matter who said that that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="91.829" dur="3.391">going to do the plans change so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="93.78" dur="3.839">you know everybody&amp;#39;s learned to</text>
  <text start="95.22" dur="4.5">flexibility in this whole deal and I</text>
  <text start="97.619" dur="3.721">think that that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s come on here</text>
  <text start="99.72" dur="3.99">and it&amp;#39;s given us a little bit of chance</text>
  <text start="101.34" dur="4.68">to mill around because Sean Hannity and</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="4.56">you know with with John Solomon and</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="4.44">Sarah Carter on Friday they opened up a</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="3.9">new can of worms because initially when</text>
  <text start="110.46" dur="3.63">they started talking about it I think</text>
  <text start="112.17" dur="3.269">most people would have assumed the same</text>
  <text start="114.09" dur="3.389">thing when they talked about the</text>
  <text start="115.439" dur="4.411">whistleblower coming forth all the news</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="4.471">was is about that raid grabbing</text>
  <text start="119.85" dur="3.96">information with the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="3.72">person in that name becoming a you know</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="3.269">public you know a lot of these folks I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="125.67" dur="5.309">sure you all have become public like</text>
  <text start="127.079" dur="6.351">Deana lines but the the situation is</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="4.581">that it Solomon had said</text>
  <text start="133.43" dur="3.449">a is the no it&amp;#39;s none of those persons</text>
  <text start="135.56" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s brand-new whistleblower but</text>
  <text start="136.879" dur="3.961">well-connected to Clint Foundation be</text>
  <text start="138.89" dur="4.849">weeded finding out more he said on</text>
  <text start="140.84" dur="5.399">Monday but I&amp;#39;d say right now in lieu of</text>
  <text start="143.739" dur="3.881">Presidents Bush death and and and</text>
  <text start="146.239" dur="3.571">what-have-you is that it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="147.62" dur="4.17">later on this week they will let that</text>
  <text start="149.81" dur="3.69">out once it dies died today it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="151.79" dur="4.35">you know the start of it I think</text>
  <text start="153.5" dur="5.34">late Wednesday they plan to have things</text>
  <text start="156.14" dur="5.159">subsided it is it&amp;#39;s important lesson</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="5.369">contained in this what just happened</text>
  <text start="161.299" dur="4.621">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s you know I I compare it to I</text>
  <text start="164.209" dur="3.511">grew up playing video games and a lot of</text>
  <text start="165.92" dur="4.02">those games were were like a strategy</text>
  <text start="167.72" dur="4.53">back-and-forth kind of like a chess game</text>
  <text start="169.94" dur="4.68">and my favorite genre was 4d chess games</text>
  <text start="172.25" dur="5.099">or 4d strategy games are the most</text>
  <text start="174.62" dur="4.769">complicated turn-based really boring for</text>
  <text start="177.349" dur="3.72">most people but I enjoy those and I see</text>
  <text start="179.389" dur="4.291">this is exactly that kind of thing with</text>
  <text start="181.069" dur="5.461">these constant give-and-take it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="183.68" dur="5.04">more of a wrestling match than people</text>
  <text start="186.53" dur="4.17">give Q all this crap for sometimes being</text>
  <text start="188.72" dur="4.079">off on a date they have a lot of power</text>
  <text start="190.7" dur="3.899">still there they&amp;#39;re able to still do</text>
  <text start="192.799" dur="4.47">their delay tactics they&amp;#39;re still able</text>
  <text start="194.599" dur="4.2">to throw some punches you know that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="197.269" dur="3.06">perfect way to put it wrestling match</text>
  <text start="198.799" dur="4.44">and I think we&amp;#39;re experienced it and</text>
  <text start="200.329" dur="5.401">it&amp;#39;s almost like on a Titanic level it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.239" dur="3.14">like the gods wrestling did you hear the</text>
  <text start="205.73" dur="4.339">Thunder</text>
  <text start="206.379" dur="7.45">but anyway get back to the suspect so</text>
  <text start="210.069" dur="5.581">you know I kind of micro do my stories</text>
  <text start="213.829" dur="3.99">on a micro level I kind of pick on</text>
  <text start="215.65" dur="3.94">individuals and build the introductory</text>
  <text start="217.819" dur="3.721">stories and tie in what their whole</text>
  <text start="219.59" dur="4.709">background is and how it ties into q</text>
  <text start="221.54" dur="4.83">drops and the cute movement so I have a</text>
  <text start="224.299" dur="4.711">whole list of Quentin associates you</text>
  <text start="226.37" dur="4.679">know obviously already in my repertoire</text>

  <text start="390.14" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s all you know it&amp;#39;s surprising that</text>

  <text start="396.26" dur="6.75">was came into recent news</text>
  <text start="400.22" dur="6.18">as far as person that represented him</text>
  <text start="403.01" dur="4.68">during his Senate grilling because he</text>
  <text start="406.4" dur="2.82">was one of the people that had his</text>
  <text start="407.69" dur="5.73">fingerprints I&amp;#39;m kind of working in a</text>
  <text start="409.22" dur="7.31">regressive motion with Justin but he was</text>
  <text start="413.42" dur="7.08">involved - Aaron assembly who&amp;#39;s part of</text>
  <text start="416.53" dur="6.22">Muller&amp;#39;s prosecutorial team in fact he</text>
  <text start="420.5" dur="4.29">folks look into him he&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="422.75" dur="7.11">nicknamed Muller&amp;#39;s right-hand man</text>
  <text start="424.79" dur="7.41">whereas he he&amp;#39;s goes back aways with</text>
  <text start="429.86" dur="4.05">being a chief of staff and such with</text>
  <text start="432.2" dur="4.5">Mahler he&amp;#39;s had a history as mother long</text>
  <text start="433.91" dur="4.74">before the probe and so forth anyway he</text>
  <text start="436.7" dur="4.29">was his own personal lawyer of record</text>
  <text start="438.65" dur="4.92">when he was that when Cooper was being</text>
  <text start="440.99" dur="6.06">interviewed by the Senate about his</text>
  <text start="443.57" dur="5.07">handling with the emails and so that</text>
  <text start="447.05" dur="3.21">came up in the news as far as they were</text>
  <text start="448.64" dur="3.39">trying to find all these connections you</text>
  <text start="450.26" dur="3.6">know like with Jeanie ray being involved</text>
  <text start="452.03" dur="4.02">with the Clinton Foundation you know</text>
  <text start="453.86" dur="3.63">where these lawyers worked before and so</text>
  <text start="456.05" dur="6.119">he got a little news awhile back about</text>
  <text start="457.49" dur="7.86">that but his primary situation was being</text>
  <text start="462.169" dur="5.041">involved with setting up the mechanics</text>
  <text start="465.35" dur="4.14">and doing the day-to-day</text>
  <text start="467.21" dur="5.31">service of the email server for Hillary</text>
  <text start="469.49" dur="4.86">Clinton beginning in 2012 until she left</text>
  <text start="472.52" dur="3.87">office and they turned it on over to</text>
  <text start="474.35" dur="3.33">Paul combate and Platt rivers networks</text>
  <text start="476.39" dur="3.42">at that point but that for whole</text>
  <text start="477.68" dur="4.26">four-year period he was the man that did</text>
  <text start="479.81" dur="3.57">you know you&amp;#39;d call up any problems you</text>
  <text start="481.94" dur="2.94">got to clear it with Justin you need a</text>
  <text start="483.38" dur="3.96">new program you want to start putting</text>
  <text start="484.88" dur="4.23">pictures on your post you know he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="487.34" dur="3.42">guy that they would call to do all the</text>
  <text start="489.11" dur="6.36">stuff all the way to the point of</text>
  <text start="490.76" dur="7.469">smashing up old phones and so that they</text>
  <text start="495.47" dur="4.49">kind of the equivalent of an of a</text>
  <text start="498.229" dur="4.981">political mercenary</text>
  <text start="499.96" dur="5.05">well yeah but you had a little bit of an</text>
  <text start="503.21" dur="4.019">evil streak done I mean you can tell it</text>
  <text start="505.01" dur="3.99">he enjoyed smashing those funds they</text>
  <text start="507.229" dur="5.551">enjoyed testifying about it you know</text>
  <text start="509" dur="7.89">these people are just not right and but</text>
  <text start="512.78" dur="8.069">that&amp;#39;s he so so so not the rumor has it</text>
  <text start="516.89" dur="5.85">but he skirted around and really a lot</text>
  <text start="520.849" dur="3.751">of people believe he lied during that</text>
  <text start="522.74" dur="3.42">Senate testimony but at the time none of</text>
  <text start="524.6" dur="3.36">those people were if they didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="526.16" dur="3.06">immunity they didn&amp;#39;t follow up on their</text>
  <text start="527.96" dur="2.85">lives do you know what I mean they were</text>
  <text start="529.22" dur="4.47">all kind of let go all these auxilary</text>

  <text start="537.77" dur="4.08">Samuelson all these people received</text>
  <text start="539.84" dur="5.12">immunities and one of the few people had</text>
  <text start="541.85" dur="5.64">to testify was this Justin Cooper and</text>
  <text start="544.96" dur="4.6">but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s his background and</text>
  <text start="547.49" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s who we feel is perhaps the</text>
  <text start="549.56" dur="4.26">leading candidate to be this new</text>
  <text start="551.54" dur="4.23">whistleblower because again he&amp;#39;s on the</text>
  <text start="553.82" dur="3.93">periphery of all this he was involved</text>
  <text start="555.77" dur="4.23">the Clintons to this day have always</text>
  <text start="557.75" dur="4.17">paid his legal bills I mean they paid to</text>
  <text start="560" dur="3.9">have Aaron&amp;#39;s anklet be it it&amp;#39;d be just</text>
  <text start="561.92" dur="4.08">like you and I you know who in the world</text>
  <text start="563.9" dur="5.73">a would even take our phone call to</text>
  <text start="566" dur="5.16">represent us to be if if we had the tens</text>
  <text start="569.63" dur="3.21">of thousands dollars to pay for these</text>
  <text start="571.16" dur="3.09">people so these guys are getting</text>
  <text start="572.84" dur="4.65">representation that they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="574.25" dur="5.49">elsewise would get on your own to begin</text>
  <text start="577.49" dur="4.38">with yeah and I would even argue then</text>
  <text start="579.74" dur="4.17">you cannot get the big fish if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="581.87" dur="5.28">letting the little fish off the hook you</text>
  <text start="583.91" dur="5.25">have to and again I agree with that that</text>
  <text start="587.15" dur="4.02">no deals theory is that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="589.16" dur="4.5">the big thing and no good nobody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.17" dur="5.13">getting off the same source that</text>
  <text start="593.66" dur="5.19">actually I got some of the information</text>
  <text start="596.3" dur="6.51">about thinking that Justin Cooper was up</text>
  <text start="598.85" dur="6.3">on top of it it has put out some other</text>
  <text start="602.81" dur="4.32">other type of teasing stuff that leads</text>
  <text start="605.15" dur="4.35">me to think that it perhaps is is true</text>
  <text start="607.13" dur="4.32">it just takes a while to to come forth</text>
  <text start="609.5" dur="4.38">the same person who says that that Nunez</text>
  <text start="611.45" dur="5.07">is going to announce the the twenty</text>
  <text start="613.88" dur="4.8">blank the twenty five thousand pages on</text>
  <text start="616.52" dur="3.54">the House floor is how the public&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="618.68" dur="2.73">going to hear about where that deep</text>
  <text start="620.06" dur="4.86">class is they&amp;#39;re giving a little low</text>
  <text start="621.41" dur="5.16">reward so that&amp;#39;s from the same source I</text>
  <text start="624.92" dur="4.95">think it for what it&amp;#39;s worth they will</text>
  <text start="626.57" dur="5.28">see that happens yeah and and things</text>
  <text start="629.87" dur="3.51">will will inevitably be delayed and</text>
  <text start="631.85" dur="6.39">delayed delayed as much as they possibly</text>
  <text start="633.38" dur="6.57">can and it&amp;#39;s difficult to do a mass</text>
  <text start="638.24" dur="3.21">arrest of the bad guys if they can take</text>
  <text start="639.95" dur="3.57">economy enough and throw everything into</text>
  <text start="641.45" dur="3.54">chaos so I think that&amp;#39;s one of their</text>
  <text start="643.52" dur="3.18">potential goals as well as well as</text>
  <text start="644.99" dur="7.83">starting a world war they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="646.7" dur="8.46">trying to do that with multiple just a</text>
  <text start="652.82" dur="3.6">little I think I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll stop</text>
  <text start="655.16" dur="2.82">the plan I think it&amp;#39;ll just delay it</text>
  <text start="656.42" dur="3.15">again if you guys see my mouth moving</text>
  <text start="657.98" dur="3.06">when you can&amp;#39;t hear any words come out</text>
  <text start="659.57" dur="5.39">and that&amp;#39;s because sometimes my dog is</text>
  <text start="661.04" dur="3.92">barking at the snow and I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="665.97" dur="5.56">okay so so suspect number two just to</text>
  <text start="669.97" dur="4.53">let your folks get a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="671.53" dur="5.13">heads up on who probably these these the</text>
  <text start="674.5" dur="3.72">culprits going to be is a lot of folks</text>
  <text start="676.66" dur="2.37">who remember this guy who is Eric</text>
  <text start="678.22" dur="4.08">Braverman</text>
