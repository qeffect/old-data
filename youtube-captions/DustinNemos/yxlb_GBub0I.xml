  <text start="45.35" dur="4.8">about updates as far as where is stop at</text>
  <text start="47.48" dur="4.829">burning right now we actually had a</text>
  <text start="50.15" dur="4.589">secret meeting of youtubers and other</text>
  <text start="52.309" dur="5.25">influencers last night we had a</text>
  <text start="54.739" dur="5.581">discussion nearly a dozen of us showed</text>
  <text start="57.559" dur="6.111">up it was a very interesting discussion</text>
  <text start="60.32" dur="5.79">a lot of good energy a lot of</text>
  <text start="63.67" dur="4">cooperative spirit right off this right</text>
  <text start="66.11" dur="3.78">off the start which I was actually not</text>
  <text start="67.67" dur="4.8">expecting I you know I expected a a</text>
  <text start="69.89" dur="4.2">little bit more hesitancy and no-one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="72.47" dur="2.94">like you know there&amp;#39;s really no</text>
  <text start="74.09" dur="2.88">commitments or anything made but</text>
  <text start="75.41" dur="3.239">everyone&amp;#39;s interested in the idea of</text>
  <text start="76.97" dur="4.35">working together to kind of where we go</text>
  <text start="78.649" dur="5.72">one with a wall take on big tech for</text>
  <text start="81.32" dur="5.339">they&amp;#39;re censoring ways now that</text>
  <text start="84.369" dur="3.64">conversation is evolving they&amp;#39;re more</text>
  <text start="86.659" dur="3.091">things going on there&amp;#39;s more meetings</text>
  <text start="88.009" dur="4.941">planned there&amp;#39;s more folks being invited</text>
  <text start="89.75" dur="5.429">so that movement is beginning to build</text>
  <text start="92.95" dur="4.3">so please anything you can do to help</text>
  <text start="95.179" dur="3.631">get the word out you know link some of</text>
  <text start="97.25" dur="3.72">these interviews like the one I did with</text>
  <text start="98.81" dur="4.89">Sean at Sgt Report or Craig from just</text>
  <text start="100.97" dur="5.16">informed talk you know encourage folks</text>
  <text start="103.7" dur="3.6">who are not yet maybe on board who</text>
  <text start="106.13" dur="3.54">haven&amp;#39;t heard about it yet who are</text>
  <text start="107.3" dur="4.86">influencers to to discuss it with us or</text>
  <text start="109.67" dur="5.28">to you know to share stop it burning</text>
  <text start="112.16" dur="4.469">comms message with others I think by</text>
  <text start="114.95" dur="4.8">coming together we can do something</text>
  <text start="116.629" dur="4.951">pretty big now that update was was part</text>
  <text start="119.75" dur="3.149">of it there&amp;#39;s also the legal half you</text>
  <text start="121.58" dur="3.72">know where are we on the legal side of</text>
  <text start="122.899" dur="4.53">things so recently I got the the</text>
  <text start="125.3" dur="4.379">research side finished with the attorney</text>
  <text start="127.429" dur="5.581">at least the first phase of that you</text>
  <text start="129.679" dur="7.471">know we at first hired him to look into</text>
  <text start="133.01" dur="6.93">the the armor that is the law that</text>
  <text start="137.15" dur="4.68">protects them from what we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="139.94" dur="4.71">do and in order to retain restore our</text>
  <text start="141.83" dur="5.37">free speech rights now in looking for a</text>
  <text start="144.65" dur="4.11">chink in that armor a weakness that we</text>
  <text start="147.2" dur="4.05">can attack from a legal perspective</text>
  <text start="148.76" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;ve identified a few different options</text>
  <text start="151.25" dur="2.36">now I want to go into too many details</text>
  <text start="152.36" dur="2.99">and kind of let him</text>
  <text start="153.61" dur="3.27">where we&amp;#39;re coming from or anything but</text>
  <text start="155.35" dur="3.15">you know some of those options were</text>
  <text start="156.88" dur="3.57">torque options some of those options</text>
  <text start="158.5" dur="4.83">were free speech options some of those</text>
  <text start="160.45" dur="4.71">options were religious freedom options I</text>
  <text start="163.33" dur="4.05">mean there&amp;#39;s some of those are monetary</text>
  <text start="165.16" dur="5.43">but you know really the idea here is</text>
  <text start="167.38" dur="5.16">that we we try to find something that we</text>
  <text start="170.59" dur="4.8">can use to break censorship so they</text>
  <text start="172.54" dur="3.8">can&amp;#39;t keep doing it to any of us and you</text>
  <text start="175.39" dur="2.97">know there were there were some</text>
  <text start="176.34" dur="5.11">questions of you know how do we get past</text>
  <text start="178.36" dur="7.98">arbitration how do we get past how do we</text>
  <text start="181.45" dur="8.13">get past some of the protections in</text>
  <text start="186.34" dur="6.39">terms of you know they have every right</text>
  <text start="189.58" dur="4.95">to as advertisers you know to choose who</text>
  <text start="192.73" dur="3.57">they advertise with and on and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="4.05">pretty good argument from a monetary</text>
  <text start="196.3" dur="4.05">perspective I don&amp;#39;t you know maybe we do</text>
  <text start="198.58" dur="4.35">maybe we don&amp;#39;t have a case in terms of</text>
  <text start="200.35" dur="3.99">the D monetization and maybe we do maybe</text>
  <text start="202.93" dur="2.73">we don&amp;#39;t have a case in terms of</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="2.88">class-action lawsuit</text>
  <text start="205.66" dur="3.96">although it seems as though we&amp;#39;d have to</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="3.87">do that in California so there are other</text>
  <text start="209.62" dur="3.54">things coming down the line other</text>
  <text start="211.09" dur="4.77">options that may present themselves and</text>
  <text start="213.16" dur="4.77">maybe it will be something obscure maybe</text>
  <text start="215.86" dur="4.08">it will be you know maybe Candace Owens</text>
  <text start="217.93" dur="3.96">will get back to us and we&amp;#39;ll help her</text>
  <text start="219.94" dur="3.54">lawsuit you know we&amp;#39;ll help her take on</text>
  <text start="221.89" dur="3.24">big text she has a great case it looks</text>
  <text start="223.48" dur="3.27">like so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s options like</text>
  <text start="225.13" dur="3.69">that and we&amp;#39;re working toward you know</text>
  <text start="226.75" dur="4.049">kind of discovering those were we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.82" dur="4.32">reaching out to the you tubers Union and</text>
  <text start="230.799" dur="3.69">Germany with York&amp;#39;s broth who&amp;#39;s got a</text>
  <text start="233.14" dur="3.21">really cool YouTube channel where he</text>
  <text start="234.489" dur="4.171">makes all sorts of you know little</text>
  <text start="236.35" dur="3.9">knickknacks and like automatic crossbows</text>
  <text start="238.66" dur="4.23">and stuff out in the woods he seems like</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="4.799">a cool guy but he is helping to organize</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="3.659">the you tubers Union in Germany which</text>
  <text start="245.049" dur="3.781">has millions of folks going against</text>
  <text start="246.549" dur="5.461">censorship as well so this is a</text>
  <text start="248.83" dur="4.8">worldwide move and I want to see the</text>
  <text start="252.01" dur="3.78">where we go when we go all movement</text>
  <text start="253.63" dur="5.37">helping out and the best way that we can</text>
  <text start="255.79" dur="4.83">you know we we we believe in a</text>
  <text start="259" dur="3.45">philosophy of teamwork at least we</text>
  <text start="260.62" dur="5.01">espoused that so here&amp;#39;s our chance to</text>
  <text start="262.45" dur="5.94">lead the way with free speech being kind</text>
  <text start="265.63" dur="4.53">of the tip of the spear if you will but</text>
  <text start="268.39" dur="5.16">just people that care about free speech</text>
  <text start="270.16" dur="6.42">and truth and freedom in general being</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="5.07">the the force behind it if you will and</text>
  <text start="276.58" dur="3.78">the more of that we get the better in</text>
  <text start="278.62" dur="3.78">fact I&amp;#39;m thinking about doing I&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="280.36" dur="3.66">to get your input maybe a campaign where</text>
  <text start="282.4" dur="3.509">people say something just a short</text>
  <text start="284.02" dur="3.06">YouTube video but you know sometimes</text>
  <text start="285.909" dur="2.91">you&amp;#39;ll see people doing stupid things</text>
  <text start="287.08" dur="3.839">like the ice bucket challenge and it</text>
  <text start="288.819" dur="4.231">goes viral maybe we could get something</text>
  <text start="290.919" dur="4.25">else viral maybe if people just do a</text>
  <text start="293.05" dur="5.64">YouTube video and they say you know</text>
  <text start="295.169" dur="4.861">censorship has to stop if not me who if</text>
  <text start="298.69" dur="4.53">not now when</text>
  <text start="300.03" dur="5.319">stop it burning stop digital sensors</text>
  <text start="303.22" dur="4.05">show things like that you know I think</text>
  <text start="305.349" dur="3.75">that that could have a powerful impact</text>

  <text start="309.099" dur="4.981">in the comments below we are obviously</text>
  <text start="311.889" dur="5.191">also looking into ways to fund this</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="4.679">expensive legal attack but I don&amp;#39;t play</text>
  <text start="317.08" dur="3.329">to lose my friends I want to win this</text>
  <text start="318.759" dur="3.03">thing and if we&amp;#39;re going to do it I want</text>
  <text start="320.409" dur="2.85">to stack the odds in our favor as much</text>
  <text start="321.789" dur="3.841">as possible that&amp;#39;s why we did the</text>
  <text start="323.259" dur="4.59">research face first most lawsuits just</text>
