  <text start="14.91" dur="4.23">corruption it&amp;#39;s almost as though I can</text>
  <text start="16.32" dur="4.619">tangibly sense it but I&amp;#39;ve met some</text>
  <text start="19.14" dur="3.96">interesting folks including Laura Loomer</text>
  <text start="20.939" dur="4.981">and just informed talk and a couple of</text>
  <text start="23.1" dur="4.38">others and strangely I ran into like a</text>
  <text start="25.92" dur="2.67">couple people who know me and our fans</text>

  <text start="36.149" dur="3.781">I&amp;#39;ve missed over the last couple of days</text>
  <text start="37.53" dur="4.14">and I&amp;#39;m getting caught up now and then</text>

  <text start="44.16" dur="4.98">conference is less than 20 folks instead</text>
  <text start="46.8" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s a lot of the little tags that</text>
  <text start="49.14" dur="5.16">they have to pass out and apparently a</text>
  <text start="52.17" dur="5.25">lot of rooms were booked so people are</text>
  <text start="54.3" dur="4.829">just not showing up for day one I was</text>
  <text start="57.42" dur="3.18">surprised people missed the Roger stone</text>
  <text start="59.129" dur="4.68">thing that was kind of a big deal I</text>
  <text start="60.6" dur="6.059">guess including you know professional</text>
  <text start="63.809" dur="5.1">bodyguard and and tons of camera people</text>
  <text start="66.659" dur="5.64">who who don&amp;#39;t mind getting in your way</text>
  <text start="68.909" dur="4.741">and he basically recapped everything</text>
  <text start="72.299" dur="4.951">that&amp;#39;s been going on with him and miller</text>
  <text start="73.65" dur="5.73">lately and and you know how that plays</text>
  <text start="77.25" dur="5.07">into the Trump Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="5.37">delusion so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happened so</text>
  <text start="82.32" dur="4.439">far lar Loomer and others did a panel on</text>
  <text start="84.75" dur="5.46">free speech and censorship things like</text>
  <text start="86.759" dur="6.691">that and and the topic even straight</text>
  <text start="90.21" dur="6.03">into the territory of Twitter actually</text>
  <text start="93.45" dur="5.309">through a person doing a question</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="5.04">actually in the audience so thank you</text>
  <text start="98.759" dur="4.171">for bringing that in to everyone but the</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="4.29">topic came off of Twitter receiving</text>
  <text start="102.93" dur="4.14">government money or or subsidies or are</text>
  <text start="105.57" dur="3.18">they really that independent do they</text>
  <text start="107.07" dur="4.07">have a monopoly because they&amp;#39;re reliant</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="5.85">on taxpayer money and government</text>
  <text start="111.14" dur="5.89">handouts and power and we have something</text>
  <text start="114.6" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s less tyrannical in the free</text>
  <text start="117.03" dur="4.979">market which I took some notes I know</text>
  <text start="119.49" dur="4.47">that there are answers to a lot of the</text>
  <text start="122.009" dur="5.04">questions that they got into but the</text>
  <text start="123.96" dur="5.669">interesting thing is that I got up and</text>
  <text start="127.049" dur="4.531">kind of asked the question or just made</text>
  <text start="129.629" dur="4.141">this statement about life log and</text>
  <text start="131.58" dur="3.72">Facebook being connected and how we</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="3.83">I know that things to cue that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="135.3" dur="5.07">really brought that out to people so</text>
  <text start="137.6" dur="6.82">obviously these companies were made from</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="7.17">day one with CIA funny money to control</text>
  <text start="144.42" dur="4.92">and and record every single thing about</text>
  <text start="147.54" dur="4.89">our lives so they can manipulate and</text>
  <text start="149.34" dur="6.69">predictor of our movements to control</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="5.34">the future so to bring about their their</text>
  <text start="156.03" dur="3.39">their dark sorcery of manipulating</text>
  <text start="157.77" dur="3.69">reality through the ways that they do</text>
  <text start="159.42" dur="5.1">with their influence and their their</text>
  <text start="161.46" dur="7.86">sophistry so anyway I&amp;#39;ve got notes this</text>
  <text start="164.52" dur="7.77">time so bear with me here but I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="169.32" dur="4.08">to just go through the list one thing</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="3.03">that&amp;#39;s interesting for those who are</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="3.63">into the crypto thing which you know I</text>
  <text start="175.32" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t cover that too much as I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="177.03" dur="5.13">do more is that Nasdaq and fidelity are</text>
  <text start="179.79" dur="4.71">of course moving into crypto exchanges</text>
  <text start="182.16" dur="4.41">so it shows the pattern of some of the</text>
  <text start="184.5" dur="3.78">big guys getting into the crypto whereas</text>
  <text start="186.57" dur="3.81">everyone else is afraid right now and</text>
  <text start="188.28" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re selling and the prices have Dan</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="6.45">just in time for Black Friday to get</text>
  <text start="192.81" dur="7.59">more and it&amp;#39;s down by like 3,700 ish for</text>
  <text start="196.83" dur="5.7">Bitcoin that&amp;#39;s pretty incredible see it</text>
  <text start="200.4" dur="3.54">was up to N and it was up to 20,000 for</text>
  <text start="202.53" dur="4.5">a while there was it was a bubble a</text>
  <text start="203.94" dur="5.16">speculative bubble I mean people they</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="4.08">often forget just how small that market</text>
  <text start="209.1" dur="4.35">camp is versus a real currency there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="211.11" dur="4.29">lot of volatility in there but the</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="3.87">technology and and all of the signs</text>
  <text start="215.4" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re happening adoption big companies</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="8.69">getting into it&amp;#39;s very good so on the</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="9.33">border we had a toddler fall 18 feet and</text>
  <text start="226.01" dur="6.25">become injured and we also had that same</text>
  <text start="230.67" dur="4.11">illegal alien that got famous the other</text>
  <text start="232.26" dur="4.05">day I don&amp;#39;t remember her name or even if</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="3.87">it mentioned it but she was interviewed</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="4.83">basically about the quality of the free</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="4.89">food that Mexico was giving the</text>
  <text start="241.14" dur="4.92">caravanners and at which time she was a</text>
  <text start="243.54" dur="4.5">caravan her and she called it pig food</text>
  <text start="246.06" dur="3.09">so the free handout that she received</text>
  <text start="248.04" dur="4.68">was not good enough for her</text>
  <text start="249.15" dur="8.309">and then photos surfaced of her dining</text>
  <text start="252.72" dur="6.12">in Texas so just I guess no good with</text>
  <text start="257.459" dur="4.291">the military I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.84" dur="4.47">going on down there you know I think we</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="4.229">could fix it with a hundred rednecks and</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="4.14">a couple of BB guns but you just you you</text>
  <text start="265.979" dur="4.171">guys make the call on that one</text>
  <text start="267.45" dur="5.73">I&amp;#39;m not encouraging violence just being</text>
  <text start="270.15" dur="4.89">sarcastic but it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="273.18" dur="4.2">insulting to see her actually sitting in</text>
  <text start="275.04" dur="3.84">taxes and eating like a meal that</text>
  <text start="277.38" dur="5.79">someone paid for right</text>
  <text start="278.88" dur="6.03">and fake news CPS boss and I have no</text>
  <text start="283.17" dur="6.33">idea how to pronounce his name but les</text>
  <text start="284.91" dur="6.42">Moonves our woundes or whatever tried to</text>
  <text start="289.5" dur="4.92">destroy evidence to cover up sexual</text>
  <text start="291.33" dur="5.79">misconduct so there&amp;#39;s so many of these</text>
  <text start="294.42" dur="4.62">in in the MSM from the rape buttons at</text>
  <text start="297.12" dur="3.87">work they they can push a button under</text>
  <text start="299.04" dur="5.13">the desk and then the door in the office</text>
  <text start="300.99" dur="4.92">locks so thin the young intern that just</text>
  <text start="304.17" dur="3.93">came in can&amp;#39;t get out things like that</text>
  <text start="305.91" dur="5.61">you know what I&amp;#39;m talking about don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="308.1" dur="5.43">you he&amp;#39;s people like Scarborough with</text>
  <text start="311.52" dur="4.95">the the mysterious to death of the girl</text>
  <text start="313.53" dur="5.7">who supposedly fell on his desk and and</text>
  <text start="316.47" dur="3.9">and and I have things like that although</text>
  <text start="319.23" dur="3.92">I don&amp;#39;t know if he had the rape button</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="7.23">that there&amp;#39;s so many scandals in those</text>
  <text start="323.15" dur="6.37">Psychopaths written halls a various MSM</text>
  <text start="327.6" dur="5.88">Ellis but people still hold them up on</text>
  <text start="329.52" dur="5.55">some sort of strange pedestal I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="333.48" dur="2.88">don&amp;#39;t really don&amp;#39;t get it people just</text>
  <text start="335.07" dur="2.46">don&amp;#39;t pay attention to the scandals</text>
  <text start="336.36" dur="4.17">because they don&amp;#39;t want to do any of</text>
  <text start="337.53" dur="5.55">these they really just don&amp;#39;t want to get</text>
  <text start="340.53" dur="4.11">into any sort of conflict they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="3.36">really care about politics they just</text>
  <text start="344.64" dur="4.44">want to go with whatever then the</text>
  <text start="346.44" dur="4.32">mainstream isn&amp;#39;t because you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.08" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s what you do without getting into</text>
  <text start="350.76" dur="3.99">arguments right no conflict no less</text>
  <text start="353.04" dur="7.11">stress I can&amp;#39;t deal with stress you know</text>
  <text start="354.75" dur="7.62">i whatever so those folks really are</text>
  <text start="360.15" dur="4.35">just non-performing NPCs you know that</text>
  <text start="362.37" dur="4.53">NPC name became very popular recently</text>
  <text start="364.5" dur="4.05">and they&amp;#39;ve just checked out of any of</text>
  <text start="366.9" dur="4.23">the decision-making and they&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="368.55" dur="6.3">with whoever can influence them the most</text>
  <text start="371.13" dur="6.15">so that is where we have to break the</text>
  <text start="374.85" dur="4.95">the matrix with the mainstream narrative</text>
  <text start="377.28" dur="4.05">you know and get the masses wakened up</text>
  <text start="379.8" dur="4.68">at some point and kind of lock in the</text>
  <text start="381.33" dur="6.33">new paradigm right now though the actual</text>
  <text start="384.48" dur="4.86">battle between the folks who are on our</text>
  <text start="387.66" dur="4.53">team and the folks who are on the Left</text>
  <text start="389.34" dur="4.29">who are actually politically engaged you</text>
  <text start="392.19" dur="4.26">know like the aunt Eva the Communists</text>
  <text start="393.63" dur="4.23">the various you know minority groups</text>
  <text start="396.45" dur="3.74">that often feel compelled to vote</text>
  <text start="397.86" dur="4.33">Democrat for free things</text>
  <text start="400.19" dur="6.05">his democrat support purport to</text>
  <text start="402.19" dur="7.42">represent minorities things like that</text>
  <text start="406.24" dur="5.59">you know it all has to at some point</text>
  <text start="409.61" dur="4.1">come to an end they&amp;#39;re delaying a lot</text>
  <text start="411.83" dur="5.76">but we are winning we&amp;#39;re winning</text>
  <text start="413.71" dur="5.4">drastically like almost non-stop and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="417.59" dur="5.04">still not tired of it by the way</text>
  <text start="419.11" dur="5.47">although obviously I&amp;#39;m getting kind of</text>
  <text start="422.63" dur="5.4">tired of footing in this many hours a</text>
  <text start="424.58" dur="4.89">week but I do it gladly I really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="428.03" dur="2.7">even get that tired honestly because</text>
  <text start="429.47" dur="2.7">we&amp;#39;ve got so much excitement about</text>
  <text start="430.73" dur="5.61">what&amp;#39;s really happening right now in the</text>
  <text start="432.17" dur="6.15">world so I also have Apple censoring</text>
  <text start="436.34" dur="3.72">political opponents basically they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="438.32" dur="3.33">using the hate speech argument this is</text>
  <text start="440.06" dur="4.05">what&amp;#39;s going to be used to censor</text>
  <text start="441.65" dur="3.93">everything that they don&amp;#39;t like of</text>
  <text start="444.11" dur="3.72">course it&amp;#39;s a double standard you can</text>
  <text start="445.58" dur="5.34">say bad things like murder Trump things</text>
  <text start="447.83" dur="5.07">like that and people threatened to kill</text>
  <text start="450.92" dur="4.59">my baby things different things of this</text>
  <text start="452.9" dur="4.23">sort totally okay and think they can get</text>
  <text start="455.51" dur="4.05">away with that kind of thing as long as</text>
  <text start="457.13" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s people on the left but if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="459.56" dur="8.04">someone saying anything offensive on the</text>
  <text start="462.89" dur="7.08">right boom banhammer hits them so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.6" dur="5.28">just a tyrant double standard and Apple</text>
  <text start="469.97" dur="5.81">has has gone down that route Trump</text>
  <text start="472.88" dur="5.16">teases Makran kind of over the the</text>
  <text start="475.78" dur="4.48">backing down to the yellow vest</text>

  <text start="493.52" dur="6.149">global warming making all the energy</text>
  <text start="495.74" dur="6.69">things expensive over this this false</text>
  <text start="499.669" dur="4.5">enemy that&amp;#39;s not even real of global</text>
  <text start="502.43" dur="3.51">warming that can never be defeated you</text>
  <text start="504.169" dur="3.571">know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s completely arbitrary</text>
  <text start="505.94" dur="3.99">humans are benefiting environment</text>
  <text start="507.74" dur="3.66">therefore attack humans that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="509.93" dur="3.45">great enemy is that should you know</text>
  <text start="511.4" dur="4.25">unify people and that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="513.38" dur="4.56">happen it&amp;#39;s not gonna happen</text>
  <text start="515.65" dur="4">maybe you guys you guys can take a look</text>
  <text start="517.94" dur="2.53">at the new technology you&amp;#39;ve got hidden</text>
  <text start="519.65" dur="2.65">and go</text>
  <text start="520.47" dur="4.38">the planet and do that that&amp;#39;s fine but</text>
  <text start="522.3" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s not gonna happen here and of course</text>
  <text start="524.85" dur="5.04">it came out that Zuckerberg was actually</text>
  <text start="527.34" dur="5.22">discussing selling user data according</text>
  <text start="529.89" dur="5.19">to leaked internal Facebook documents of</text>
  <text start="532.56" dur="4.89">course he he denied ever doing things</text>
  <text start="535.08" dur="7.47">like that selling data or any of that</text>
  <text start="537.45" dur="7.38">nonsense in China despite this it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="542.55" dur="3.99">very face saving culture right like that</text>
  <text start="544.83" dur="4.62">if you&amp;#39;ve ever known Chinese or</text>
  <text start="546.54" dur="4.92">Taiwanese or many Asians actually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="549.45" dur="5.16">very much a face culture you do not</text>
  <text start="551.46" dur="5.22">dishonor public anything you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="554.61" dur="4.44">embarrass the family public anything and</text>
  <text start="556.68" dur="6.75">parents have disowned their kids for for</text>
  <text start="559.05" dur="6.78">for mess-ups things like that so in that</text>
  <text start="563.43" dur="4.35">kind of culture a leader cannot back</text>
  <text start="565.83" dur="5.28">down right he cannot be seen to be weak</text>
  <text start="567.78" dur="5.4">so in that case she&amp;#39;s in pain they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="571.11" dur="5.97">made some statements in China in Chinese</text>
  <text start="573.18" dur="8.22">national media kind of left out some of</text>
  <text start="577.08" dur="6.48">the points kind of fudged a little bit</text>
  <text start="581.4" dur="3.69">but it made it sound like you know</text>
  <text start="583.56" dur="4.05">things were good they weren&amp;#39;t gonna back</text>
  <text start="585.09" dur="4.29">down whatever so they put their own spin</text>
  <text start="587.61" dur="3.84">on it of course but it is interesting to</text>
  <text start="589.38" dur="4.2">see that they have now announced</text>

  <text start="691.86" dur="5.08">we also have that really strange funeral</text>
  <text start="694.6" dur="4.65">where where bill fell asleep Hillary had</text>
  <text start="696.94" dur="3.839">these weird emotions toward the ceiling</text>
  <text start="699.25" dur="4.5">that was kind of strange no to her past</text>
  <text start="700.779" dur="6.93">back and forth Hillary got a letter a</text>
  <text start="703.75" dur="6.99">whole letter it looked like Jeb kind of</text>
  <text start="707.709" dur="5.581">freaked out when he got a side of one of</text>
  <text start="710.74" dur="5.31">one thing maybe a symbol or short words</text>
  <text start="713.29" dur="5.13">as it was quick you know he had instant</text>
  <text start="716.05" dur="4.59">recognition and then he just looked</text>
  <text start="718.42" dur="3.96">horrified afterwards so of course</text>
  <text start="720.64" dur="4.11">passing around thumb drives and things</text>
  <text start="722.38" dur="4.44">like that that happened a few times at</text>
  <text start="724.75" dur="3.779">this one too which is very encouraging</text>
  <text start="726.82" dur="3.68">that they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re so desperate</text>

  <text start="735.94" dur="9.35">welfare and mueller recommended no jail</text>
  <text start="741.76" dur="6.21">for Flint so my thoughts on that</text>
  <text start="745.29" dur="4.54">of course he realizes how weak his</text>
  <text start="747.97" dur="3.63">position is right so he can&amp;#39;t really win</text>
  <text start="749.83" dur="6.48">it and he doesn&amp;#39;t want to be I guess in</text>
  <text start="751.6" dur="6.18">to to to be too aggressive on something</text>
  <text start="756.31" dur="3.09">he can&amp;#39;t win or he doesn&amp;#39;t he maybe he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="757.78" dur="3.9">just afraid of her blowback I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="759.4" dur="4.62">I don&amp;#39;t know why Miller would suddenly</text>
  <text start="761.68" dur="3.81">back down on that but he has a weak</text>
  <text start="764.02" dur="4.97">position and I think he realizes it and</text>
  <text start="765.49" dur="8.01">I think he knows he&amp;#39;s losing so I think</text>
  <text start="768.99" dur="6.52">that is all of my notes for at least so</text>
  <text start="773.5" dur="4.08">far on this trip so I will see you guys</text>
