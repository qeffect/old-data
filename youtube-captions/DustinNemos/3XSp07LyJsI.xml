  <text start="13.65" dur="3.51">going to talk about some of the non</text>
  <text start="14.88" dur="4.319">impeachment news or really impeachment</text>
  <text start="17.16" dur="4.14">related but are still very important for</text>

  <text start="214.63" dur="2.52">happening now</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="3.06">there&amp;#39;s some pretty big bombshells in</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="3.179">here if you&amp;#39;re paying attention now I</text>
  <text start="218.65" dur="4.08">know that there&amp;#39;s distractions happening</text>
  <text start="220.329" dur="4.47">including another mass murder spree</text>
  <text start="222.73" dur="5.22">fortunately this one was stopped I think</text>
  <text start="224.799" dur="6.09">the suicide of murder at this point it</text>
  <text start="227.95" dur="4.65">was a masked serial suicide spree and</text>
  <text start="230.889" dur="4.021">seems to be a lot of that lately I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="232.6" dur="4.32">know what that is maybe that&amp;#39;s the voice</text>
  <text start="234.91" dur="3.81">of God technologies that the Q anon</text>
  <text start="236.92" dur="4.05">movement has brought attention to it can</text>
  <text start="238.72" dur="3.9">it can be used to trigger the weak minds</text>
  <text start="240.97" dur="3.45">of certain people that have mental</text>
  <text start="242.62" dur="4.22">issues anyway and you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.42" dur="5.159">patents for this kind of electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="4.57">manipulation of different aspects of the</text>
  <text start="249.579" dur="3.901">brain through televisions through phones</text>
  <text start="251.41" dur="3.509">through through EMF waves things like</text>
  <text start="253.48" dur="3.09">that so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not all that</text>
  <text start="254.919" dur="3.72">far-fetched if the technology has</text>
  <text start="256.57" dur="4.199">already been discovered and it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="258.639" dur="4.231">patents and large movements are</text>
  <text start="260.769" dur="4.051">discussing it and the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.87" dur="3.33">investigating it in terms of research</text>
  <text start="264.82" dur="3.6">and such we know about some of</text>
  <text start="266.2" dur="3.87">and on top of all of that they&amp;#39;re even</text>
  <text start="268.42" dur="3.84">putting it in pop culture movies out</text>
  <text start="270.07" dur="3.96">there where you know the whole world is</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="2.97">flipped on a switch and everyone&amp;#39;s cell</text>
  <text start="274.03" dur="3.12">phone makes them start killing each</text>
  <text start="275.23" dur="2.28">other and hate which I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="277.15" dur="1.5">there yet</text>
  <text start="277.51" dur="2.97">I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s anywhere near that</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="5.03">close in terms of Technology but you can</text>
  <text start="280.48" dur="5.79">see kind of one of those imaginations of</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="5.2">some sick and twisted individuals and</text>
  <text start="286.27" dur="4.98">usually science fiction happens before</text>
  <text start="288.88" dur="4.08">the science catches up to it so if you</text>
  <text start="291.25" dur="3.9">can dream it it can be done and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="292.96" dur="4.44">want to see that world happen but anyway</text>
  <text start="295.15" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s kind of a side topic I just want to</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="3.51">bring attention to these mass shootings</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="4.35">and these mass murder situations because</text>
  <text start="300.91" dur="4.59">it seems to happen generally and I</text>
  <text start="303.4" dur="3.36">wonder if anyone&amp;#39;s actually sat down and</text>
  <text start="305.5" dur="3.33">done the math it seems to happen</text>
  <text start="306.76" dur="5.01">generally when the Democrats are getting</text>
  <text start="308.83" dur="4.29">bad news in the news cycle right so</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="3.51">right now of course impeachment is</text>
  <text start="313.12" dur="3.87">flopping they&amp;#39;re losing and I know this</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="4.17">isn&amp;#39;t the impeachment video but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="316.99" dur="3.9">losing in fact instead of gaining it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.45" dur="3.09">actually hurting them so they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="320.89" dur="3.51">trying to get off impeachment although</text>
  <text start="322.54" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re doubling down and and</text>
  <text start="324.4" dur="3.57">trying to just see what they can do</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="2.58">because they don&amp;#39;t really have another</text>
  <text start="327.97" dur="3.54">option and they know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.23" dur="4.56">running out of time so that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="331.51" dur="4.53">why I think we have these these mass</text>
  <text start="333.79" dur="5.31">events these weapons of mass distraction</text>
  <text start="336.04" dur="5.04">these bogus banner events or even real</text>
  <text start="339.1" dur="4.71">events where real people die including</text>
  <text start="341.08" dur="5.01">children sometimes and then the story</text>
  <text start="343.81" dur="3.84">that we get is either covered up because</text>
  <text start="346.09" dur="2.91">it wasn&amp;#39;t a white person and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="347.65" dur="3.39">want to bring attention to like Muslim</text>
  <text start="349" dur="3.21">terrorists or it was brought tons of</text>
  <text start="351.04" dur="3.63">attention to and then there was</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="4.86">deceptions involved like they try to put</text>
  <text start="354.67" dur="3.84">a post up on on 8chan and then blame it</text>
  <text start="357.07" dur="3.81">on I think it was actually on 4chan and</text>
  <text start="358.51" dur="4.47">then they try to blame it on on you know</text>
  <text start="360.88" dur="4.2">he went on or the qyn on movement call</text>
  <text start="362.98" dur="4.95">us violent crazies and nonsense stuff so</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="4.92">these kind of ridiculous tactics work</text>
  <text start="367.93" dur="4.56">unless you bring attention to them so</text>
  <text start="370" dur="3.96">without with all that context almost</text>
  <text start="372.49" dur="4.68">three minutes worth let&amp;#39;s dive into the</text>
  <text start="373.96" dur="5.1">news so Nunez is suing CNN for a junk</text>
  <text start="377.17" dur="4.56">report on the Vienna meeting he says he</text>
  <text start="379.06" dur="5.4">was never in Austria in December 2018 he</text>
  <text start="381.73" dur="5.31">was in Libya so you know here&amp;#39;s noon as</text>
  <text start="384.46" dur="4.77">going after CNN for fake news that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="387.04" dur="3.33">cheap he must really have them you know</text>
  <text start="389.23" dur="3.21">these companies will bring a hundred</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="4.29">lawyers against you and they they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="392.44" dur="4.59">do that forever because eventually we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="394.66" dur="4.18">going to drain them all now Bill and</text>
  <text start="397.03" dur="4.57">Hillary were also regular</text>
  <text start="398.84" dur="5.549">guests at abstains ranch in New Mexico</text>
  <text start="401.6" dur="5.28">and even Chelsea stayed there this is</text>
  <text start="404.389" dur="3.991">the the baby-makin ranch where Epstein</text>
  <text start="406.88" dur="3.9">had planned to create a new human race</text>
  <text start="408.38" dur="8.19">of I guess genetically modified super</text>
  <text start="410.78" dur="8.46">humans with his harem of women probably</text>
  <text start="416.57" dur="5.25">underage woman but anyway this is weird</text>
  <text start="419.24" dur="4.77">and I&amp;#39;m not surprised to see the</text>
  <text start="421.82" dur="7.23">Clintons as a frequent guest and</text>
  <text start="424.01" dur="6.6">definitely a history right they have a</text>
  <text start="429.05" dur="3.9">history they go back Bill Clinton was on</text>
  <text start="430.61" dur="5.52">the lead expressed a number of times I</text>
  <text start="432.95" dur="4.83">think over 26 and Counting Hillary was</text>
  <text start="436.13" dur="4.23">on there many times they stayed at the</text>
  <text start="437.78" dur="5.16">island there they ditched the FBI and</text>
  <text start="440.36" dur="3.99">secured or not if the I was so Secret</text>
  <text start="442.94" dur="4.289">Service when they went to some of these</text>
  <text start="444.35" dur="6.45">events with Epstein so we know what was</text>
  <text start="447.229" dur="6.601">really happening now convicted pedophile</text>
  <text start="450.8" dur="4.589">George Nadler was used in Mueller</text>
  <text start="453.83" dur="4.17">investigation against Trump with the</text>
  <text start="455.389" dur="4.59">whole rush of collusion delusion he has</text>

  <text start="462.65" dur="6.48">Hillary during the 2016 campaign against</text>
  <text start="466.97" dur="4.8">President Trump so this is kind of a big</text>
  <text start="469.13" dur="5.19">deal I would say and even Politico is</text>
  <text start="471.77" dur="5.04">reporting quote the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="474.32" dur="5.04">refers only to an unidentified 2016</text>
  <text start="476.81" dur="4.32">presidential candidate but campaign</text>
  <text start="479.36" dur="3.869">finance records made clear that the</text>
  <text start="481.13" dur="3.75">candidate was Clinton so it&amp;#39;d be pretty</text>
  <text start="483.229" dur="3.571">easy to track down the numbers now that</text>
  <text start="484.88" dur="4.8">the truth is out there and Hillary is in</text>
  <text start="486.8" dur="6.54">big trouble for this we&amp;#39;ll see how long</text>
  <text start="489.68" dur="6.75">it takes now under Trump NATO countries</text>
  <text start="493.34" dur="4.47">are and allies are now finally paying at</text>
  <text start="496.43" dur="3.419">least somewhat of their financial</text>
  <text start="497.81" dur="4.38">obligations to NATO something we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="499.849" dur="3.781">need shouldn&amp;#39;t exist but at least we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="582.47" dur="4.74">make this article brings up the fact</text>
  <text start="585.5" dur="4.05">that Chinese students are for grade</text>
  <text start="587.21" dur="4.17">levels ahead of us students in math now</text>
  <text start="589.55" dur="5.07">I talked about kind of the difference</text>
  <text start="591.38" dur="5.22">between sort of Western culture and</text>
  <text start="594.62" dur="4.14">Chinese culture even though Chinese</text>
  <text start="596.6" dur="4.53">culture has a higher IQ on average by a</text>

  <text start="601.13" dur="4.38">Westerner they don&amp;#39;t do as well in</text>
  <text start="604.16" dur="3.36">creativity because of sort of the</text>

  <text start="609.32" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s not conducive to creativity however</text>
  <text start="612.05" dur="4.2">when it comes to things that are inside</text>
  <text start="614.09" dur="3.33">the box like accepted sciences and</text>
  <text start="616.25" dur="3.54">things of that nature where you can</text>
  <text start="617.42" dur="3.21">excel within the strictures that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="619.79" dur="2.46">given</text>
  <text start="620.63" dur="3.72">Chinese people tend to do really well</text>
  <text start="622.25" dur="3.87">especially it perfections like doctor or</text>
  <text start="624.35" dur="3.87">math or or scientist things of that</text>
  <text start="626.12" dur="4.98">nature so they tend to do really well</text>
  <text start="628.22" dur="5.1">there and it&amp;#39;s not a surprise especially</text>
  <text start="631.1" dur="4.71">after Common Core has been introduced in</text>
  <text start="633.32" dur="4.11">the u.s. you know two plus two is five</text>
  <text start="635.81" dur="2.97">if you can explain it right so that</text>
  <text start="637.43" dur="3.81">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense at all we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="638.78" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re actually teaching I went through</text>
  <text start="641.24" dur="3.66">this in an interview if you can check it</text>
  <text start="642.92" dur="4.17">out with Alex Newman where we broke down</text>
  <text start="644.9" dur="4.02">Common Core and the education system and</text>
  <text start="647.09" dur="4.26">the damage that it does to the young</text>

  <text start="651.35" dur="5.07">through history of making people hate</text>
  <text start="653.63" dur="5.01">learning to destroy the education of an</text>
  <text start="656.42" dur="4.23">entire generation of young people that</text>
  <text start="658.64" dur="5.4">is what Common Core is doing right now</text>
  <text start="660.65" dur="5.17">now also as I said President Trump is</text>
  <text start="664.04" dur="4.57">taking the fight for five</text>

  <text start="671.79" dur="3.15">punishments of any kind for anyone</text>
  <text start="673.44" dur="3.6">because the government&amp;#39;s the source of</text>
  <text start="674.94" dur="3.93">most of our problems and usually the the</text>
  <text start="677.04" dur="4.8">fixes that they give us create more</text>
  <text start="678.87" dur="5.58">problems not solutions however there are</text>
  <text start="681.84" dur="5.28">a massive number of treasonous traitors</text>
  <text start="684.45" dur="5.61">who hurt children who have engaged in</text>
  <text start="687.12" dur="4.86">corruption who&amp;#39;ve sold us out who will</text>
  <text start="690.06" dur="4.32">hurt more children and hurt more people</text>
  <text start="691.98" dur="4.35">if they are not stopped and this issue</text>
  <text start="694.38" dur="3.72">has to be dealt with including some of</text>
  <text start="696.33" dur="3.66">these high level drug traffickers and</text>
  <text start="698.1" dur="4.5">such because he&amp;#39;s already said death</text>
  <text start="699.99" dur="4.38">penalty for drug traffickers - maybe we</text>
  <text start="702.6" dur="3.75">can get some of the Sackler family in</text>
  <text start="704.37" dur="4.68">there - you know but the opioid crisis</text>
  <text start="706.35" dur="4.28">that they&amp;#39;ve helped to create now of</text>
  <text start="709.05" dur="3.69">course you know everything here is legal</text>
  <text start="710.63" dur="3.76">politically speaking I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="712.74" dur="3.15">about any kind of extrajudicial stuff</text>
  <text start="714.39" dur="3.03">because they will ban me outright though</text>
  <text start="715.89" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;ll put it all over CNN they&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="717.42" dur="4.44">cue movement leader says crazy violent</text>
  <text start="719.67" dur="4.02">stuff and I always have to clarify that</text>
  <text start="721.86" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s no violence within the cue</text>
  <text start="723.69" dur="4.08">movement it&amp;#39;s all about legal justice</text>
  <text start="726.66" dur="2.67">that&amp;#39;s the whole cue movement thing</text>
  <text start="727.77" dur="3.51">that&amp;#39;s why they fear it so much because</text>
  <text start="729.33" dur="4.25">we&amp;#39;re just sitting here bringing</text>
  <text start="731.28" dur="4.11">attention to issues and corruption and</text>
  <text start="733.58" dur="4.51">constantly putting the pressure on</text>
  <text start="735.39" dur="4.53">justice justice justice we want to see</text>
  <text start="738.09" dur="3.87">legal justice in the courts which have</text>
  <text start="739.92" dur="4.35">now been stacked in the favor of the</text>
  <text start="741.96" dur="4.14">Constitution and rule of law and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="744.27" dur="3.48">now seeing the different changes that</text>
  <text start="746.1" dur="4.08">are taking effect like we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="747.75" dur="4.55">see even the Ninth Circuit get someone</text>
  <text start="750.18" dur="4.74">from from president Trump&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="752.3" dur="5.05">being picked on there so he picked one</text>
  <text start="754.92" dur="3.84">of the the new Ninth Circuit judges now</text>
  <text start="757.35" dur="3.03">we&amp;#39;ve got a Supreme Court justice</text>
  <text start="758.76" dur="3.81">Cavanaugh in there we&amp;#39;ve kind of flipped</text>
  <text start="760.38" dur="4.29">the majority somewhat you know we have</text>
  <text start="762.57" dur="3.45">rhinos and such so we&amp;#39;re starting to get</text>
  <text start="764.67" dur="3">to that point where we can get some</text>
  <text start="766.02" dur="4.35">changes we can roll back some of the</text>
  <text start="767.67" dur="6.69">corruption and we can roll forward some</text>
  <text start="770.37" dur="6.63">of the justice now last but oh not quite</text>
  <text start="774.36" dur="5.25">last the shooting at Pearl Harbor Naval</text>
  <text start="777" dur="5.67">Shipyard in Hawaii shooter is down I</text>
  <text start="779.61" dur="5.28">think he shot himself killed multiple</text>
  <text start="782.67" dur="6.15">victims or shot multiple victims at</text>
  <text start="784.89" dur="5.7">least multiple victims yeah I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="788.82" dur="4.92">he doesn&amp;#39;t say anyone was killed but</text>
  <text start="790.59" dur="4.32">after three victims were shot so at</text>
  <text start="793.74" dur="2.34">least three people were injured two</text>
  <text start="794.91" dur="2.75">critically in an active shooter</text>
  <text start="796.08" dur="5.45">situation Wednesday afternoon</text>
  <text start="797.66" dur="6.47">at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard the saw</text>
  <text start="801.53" dur="5.82">the gunman fatally shoot himself and</text>
  <text start="804.13" dur="5.26">yeah one of the victims was taking to</text>
  <text start="807.35" dur="3.84">the Tripler Army Medical Center one to</text>
  <text start="809.39" dur="3.06">Pali momi Medical Center and a third to</text>
  <text start="811.19" dur="5.79">Queens and that whole scene is weird</text>
  <text start="812.45" dur="8.67">okay so another distraction another</text>
  <text start="816.98" dur="7.28">event that is possibly just random act</text>
  <text start="821.12" dur="5.04">of hate possibly meant to distract from</text>
  <text start="824.26" dur="4.03">what&amp;#39;s happening at the impeachment</text>
  <text start="826.16" dur="4.65">Fiasco you always have to ask these</text>
  <text start="828.29" dur="5.73">questions now because it the real world</text>
  <text start="830.81" dur="6.18">is complicated now here we have Trudeau</text>
  <text start="834.02" dur="5.31">mocking President Trump and while he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="836.99" dur="6.09">out of the room with other world leaders</text>
  <text start="839.33" dur="4.68">like Mac ROM and Boris Johnson and I</text>
  <text start="843.08" dur="2.52">don&amp;#39;t know if this other guy is</text>
  <text start="844.01" dur="4.44">something he&amp;#39;s kind of facing the other</text>
  <text start="845.6" dur="4.65">way anyway so he basically just kind of</text>
  <text start="848.45" dur="4.26">makes fun of President Trump about how</text>
  <text start="850.25" dur="6.06">he was Laden and did an impromptu press</text>
  <text start="852.71" dur="6.36">conference and how he made Trump&amp;#39;s staff</text>
  <text start="856.31" dur="5.34">drop their jaws dropped to the floor and</text>
  <text start="859.07" dur="5.61">things like that so you know this is</text>
  <text start="861.65" dur="5.58">just kind of backbiting weak talk from</text>
  <text start="864.68" dur="4.35">from petty man you know it just because</text>
  <text start="867.23" dur="4.11">you go into a room with lots of columns</text>
  <text start="869.03" dur="4.29">and shiny lights and chandeliers and and</text>
  <text start="871.34" dur="3.51">wealthy people in suits doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="873.32" dur="4.59">that high school suddenly ended right</text>
  <text start="874.85" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s just how people are unfortunately</text>
  <text start="877.91" dur="4.41">no matter how smart they get no matter</text>
  <text start="879.47" dur="4.71">how high up you get among the classes</text>
  <text start="882.32" dur="3.54">right they&amp;#39;re still gonna be these</text>
  <text start="884.18" dur="5.25">really petty people that are driven by</text>
  <text start="885.86" dur="8.54">selfishness and greed and and these kind</text>
  <text start="889.43" dur="6.81">of I don&amp;#39;t know how you&amp;#39;d call it not</text>
  <text start="894.4" dur="3.7">not rankings</text>
  <text start="896.24" dur="4.08">you know how the chickens have kind of</text>
  <text start="898.1" dur="5.15">like a clucking or a pecking order is</text>
  <text start="900.32" dur="7.35">kind of like that I guess the whole</text>
  <text start="903.25" dur="5.62">hierarchy fight is really vindictive and</text>
  <text start="907.67" dur="2.88">petty when you get to these kind of</text>
  <text start="908.87" dur="3.54">people now there are good people out</text>
  <text start="910.55" dur="3.93">there that like a Ron Paul that can</text>
  <text start="912.41" dur="3.24">still achieve power and do so in a good</text>
  <text start="914.48" dur="3.33">way and I&amp;#39;m whirlaway</text>

  <text start="917.81" dur="4.2">surrounded by these kind of petty</text>
  <text start="919.25" dur="4.89">backbiting two-faced people like Trudeau</text>
  <text start="922.01" dur="4.13">especially especially to face because he</text>
