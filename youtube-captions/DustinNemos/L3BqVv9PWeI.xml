  <text start="51.98" dur="3.87">they have no sort of precedent that</text>
  <text start="53.75" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re using to stand on here they have</text>
  <text start="55.85" dur="5.13">nothing but hate an argument they even</text>
  <text start="57.8" dur="5.669">had to tell the Democrats to not cheer</text>
  <text start="60.98" dur="5.13">when they voted to impeach although the</text>

  <text start="72.8" dur="4.2">claim that it was nonpartisan so all</text>
  <text start="74.57" dur="4.68">this and more hopefully it won&amp;#39;t lead</text>
  <text start="77" dur="3.66">the Civil War I suspect actually that it</text>
  <text start="79.25" dur="5.19">will lead to the arrest of people like</text>
  <text start="80.66" dur="6.239">Pelosi Schumer Schiff Clinton and even</text>
  <text start="84.44" dur="4.56">Obama and some of these deep state DOJ</text>

  <text start="134.459" dur="4.681">proceedings against President Trump the</text>
  <text start="136.11" dur="4.62">resolution passed by a final vote of 232</text>
  <text start="139.14" dur="3.12">to 196</text>
  <text start="140.73" dur="4.35">of course the Democrats are claiming</text>
  <text start="142.26" dur="4.229">that it was nonpartisan or even multi</text>
  <text start="145.08" dur="3.409">partisan as the word that came out</text>
  <text start="146.489" dur="4.711">because Justin he matched that</text>
  <text start="148.489" dur="4.33">republican turned traitorous independent</text>
  <text start="151.2" dur="4.08">has been voting democrat pretty</text>
  <text start="152.819" dur="5.071">consistently and has also voted for the</text>
  <text start="155.28" dur="5.28">impeachment proceeding big shock right</text>
  <text start="157.89" dur="5.28">not really Justin Amash was always a</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="5.58">fake Republican a fake Naga and a rhino</text>
  <text start="163.17" dur="5.159">and a traitor we also have of course</text>
  <text start="166.14" dur="4.59">this the simple fact that this is moving</text>
  <text start="168.329" dur="5.011">ahead with no Republicans involved and</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="5.13">even two Democrats against it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="173.34" dur="4.41">highly contested but it is moving ahead</text>
  <text start="175.86" dur="3.86">now only in the house and of course they</text>
  <text start="177.75" dur="3.9">still have no chance whatsoever</text>
  <text start="179.72" dur="3.879">especially not with people like</text>
  <text start="181.65" dur="3.78">President Trump the Nunez and others and</text>
  <text start="183.599" dur="3.211">gates pointing out all of the</text>
  <text start="185.43" dur="4.02">inconsistencies in the story and</text>
  <text start="186.81" dur="5.33">bringing attention this stuff only works</text>
  <text start="189.45" dur="5.25">when people are not paying attention and</text>
  <text start="192.14" dur="4.24">fortunately for us President Trump knows</text>
  <text start="194.7" dur="3.93">that he has the bully pulpit so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="196.38" dur="5.31">just no way in hell to secretly impeach</text>
  <text start="198.63" dur="5.34">the world&amp;#39;s most popular president it</text>

  <text start="484.09" dur="7.44">for any glee or comfort this is</text>
  <text start="489.22" dur="5.24">something that is very solemn that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.53" dur="2.93">something prayerful</text>
  <text start="495.09" dur="3.43">yes okay at the end of the day she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.499" dur="3.63">just trying to convince people that</text>
  <text start="498.52" dur="4.35">she&amp;#39;s a constitutionalist suddenly she</text>
  <text start="501.129" dur="4.62">cares about the Constitution she cares</text>
  <text start="502.87" dur="4.409">about your rights and she just wants to</text>
  <text start="505.749" dur="3.331">use all of these things to take on our</text>
  <text start="507.279" dur="5.7">president because it&amp;#39;s just her sworn</text>
  <text start="509.08" dur="6.06">solemn duty and she has to write we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="512.979" dur="3.6">not buying that at all clearly she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="515.14" dur="3.689">been behind this and she&amp;#39;s been helping</text>
  <text start="516.579" dur="3.871">in it and and maybe she was trying to</text>
  <text start="518.829" dur="4.051">just put it off because it wasn&amp;#39;t her</text>
  <text start="520.45" dur="4.199">fight and I don&amp;#39;t know Trump left her in</text>
  <text start="522.88" dur="4.98">there and power for a reason she&amp;#39;s weak</text>
  <text start="524.649" dur="5.671">and maybe the other the squad and all of</text>
  <text start="527.86" dur="3.78">those have pushed to the point where she</text>
  <text start="530.32" dur="4.41">has no choice but to go through with the</text>
  <text start="531.64" dur="5.28">impeachment right but either way this is</text>
  <text start="534.73" dur="4.14">this is baloney this is completely bogus</text>
  <text start="536.92" dur="3.99">she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s sitting there lying to</text>
  <text start="538.87" dur="4.68">everyone about how she cares about in</text>
  <text start="540.91" dur="4.289">the Constitution and I noticed that she</text>
  <text start="543.55" dur="5.039">almost stuttered when she said that</text>
  <text start="545.199" dur="5.851">these multiple branches the the</text>
  <text start="548.589" dur="5.18">executive and the legislative and the</text>
  <text start="551.05" dur="5.729">judiciary are set to balance each other</text>
  <text start="553.769" dur="4.481">she probably should have was thinking</text>
  <text start="556.779" dur="2.941">that it was just her set to balance</text>
  <text start="558.25" dur="4.26">everyone else that she doesn&amp;#39;t like and</text>
  <text start="559.72" dur="5.67">agree with but uh anyway she went right</text>
  <text start="562.51" dur="5.579">on through it so boom representative</text>
