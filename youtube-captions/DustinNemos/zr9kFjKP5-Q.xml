  <text start="53.55" dur="4.71">codes and ciphers and data systems and</text>

  <text start="96.21" dur="5.369">is being electronically generated and</text>
  <text start="98.22" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s basically my my forte was to</text>
  <text start="101.579" dur="4.351">figure out what it all meant and take</text>
  <text start="103.56" dur="3.75">meaning and uh knowledge out of it so</text>
  <text start="105.93" dur="3.42">basically you&amp;#39;re like sitting at the</text>

  <text start="125.969" dur="4.65">with you know why you shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="128.55" dur="4.019">pretty casual but I do have some</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="2.761">questions I do want to think again for</text>
  <text start="132.569" dur="3.241">your time</text>
  <text start="133.38" dur="5.79">I know I&amp;#39;ll dive right in here gorilla</text>
  <text start="135.81" dur="6.27">so I want to start with an emotional</text>
  <text start="139.17" dur="4.26">question you know I I double tracked</text>
  <text start="142.08" dur="4.5">beforehand to make sure this is okay I</text>
  <text start="143.43" dur="4.68">didn&amp;#39;t spring it on him but it was like</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="3.78">when you were in the shower in the FBI</text>
  <text start="148.11" dur="3.96">bro clean your home and you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="150.36" dur="4.35">most people don&amp;#39;t know this necessarily</text>

  <text start="154.71" dur="4.83">that feel like and how did they treat</text>
  <text start="155.97" dur="5.43">you well first of all I wasn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="159.54" dur="3.93">have any legs amputated till after they</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="3.74">raided us that came in about three years</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="5.79">afterward it started to have a problem</text>
  <text start="165.14" dur="6.01">but I was basically see I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="169.26" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s well known but I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="171.15" dur="3.96">cooperating with the FBI for a number of</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="4.29">months about four months before that</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="4.53">starting early in March I had a first</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="3.66">meeting with the FBI because they were</text>
  <text start="179.64" dur="5.31">investigating the New York Times leak of</text>
  <text start="181.59" dur="6.27">the warrantless wiretapping program so</text>
  <text start="184.95" dur="4.68">and that was just the that was just the</text>
  <text start="187.86" dur="4.5">miniscule amount that had been exposed</text>
  <text start="189.63" dur="4.38">by but and talked about by the President</text>
  <text start="192.36" dur="4.35">so that&amp;#39;s all they were talking about</text>
  <text start="194.01" dur="4.71">not the bulk acquisition of data content</text>
  <text start="196.71" dur="4.65">and metadata on everybody in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="198.72" dur="4.56">first of all we were first we were first</text>
  <text start="201.36" dur="3.75">in the pit for bulk acquisition and then</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="5.22">everybody else came along afterwards so</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="5.25">we were trying to hide that yeah so and</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="5.22">I had been cooperating with with them</text>
  <text start="210.36" dur="5.4">for months telling them all about know</text>
  <text start="213.72" dur="5.01">the thinthread program and all that and</text>
  <text start="215.76" dur="4.71">and also all the things that I had been</text>
  <text start="218.73" dur="4.68">doing there and the people I knew were</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="5.67">involved and so when they came in</text>
  <text start="223.41" dur="4.86">pointing a gun with me I was kind of</text>
  <text start="226.14" dur="2.55">surprised you know what are you doing</text>
  <text start="228.27" dur="2.07">here</text>
  <text start="228.69" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;ve been cooperating with you you know</text>
  <text start="230.34" dur="4.5">what&amp;#39;s the matter with you so but it</text>
  <text start="232.26" dur="4.71">really was easy the raid occurred the</text>
  <text start="234.84" dur="4.08">morning of the second day at the</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="4.65">Gonzales lead then attorney general</text>
  <text start="238.92" dur="5.82">Gonzales his testimony to the Senate</text>
  <text start="241.62" dur="5.04">Judiciary Committee on the terrorist</text>
  <text start="244.74" dur="3.57">surveillance drug the parent president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="3.299">terrorist surveillance program well</text>
  <text start="248.31" dur="3.87">there he basically only told him a</text>
  <text start="249.959" dur="3.931">partial truth again only dealing with</text>
  <text start="252.18" dur="3.15">what had been exposed by the president</text>
  <text start="253.89" dur="3.54">and not talking about all the rest of</text>
  <text start="255.33" dur="4.11">the program that was involving</text>
  <text start="257.43" dur="3.71">collection of content and metadata on</text>
  <text start="259.44" dur="3.87">everybody in the US and around the world</text>
  <text start="261.14" dur="5.81">nor did he talk about the torture</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="6.31">programs or any other programs at CIA so</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="4.68">he was hot he had a lot to hide and so</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="4.14">he sent the FBI and sure it was him</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="4.14">he sent the FBI to raid us to keep us</text>
  <text start="273.76" dur="4.26">off-balance because he he knew that we</text>
  <text start="275.77" dur="4.11">had a tendency to going to going to</text>
  <text start="278.02" dur="2.61">congressional committees and telling</text>
  <text start="279.88" dur="2.25">them the truth</text>
  <text start="280.63" dur="3.54">that was something most of the</text>
  <text start="282.13" dur="4.32">intelligence agencies don&amp;#39;t do by the</text>
  <text start="284.17" dur="5.37">way they do not tell them the truth it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.45" dur="5.31">the same in England and GCHQ doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="289.54" dur="4.95">tell the truth to the parliament members</text>
  <text start="291.76" dur="4.7">so it&amp;#39;s so different these agencies are</text>
  <text start="294.49" dur="4.74">pretty much standard around the world</text>
  <text start="296.46" dur="6.7">it&amp;#39;s a power thing like these agencies</text>
  <text start="299.23" dur="6.09">that show more power than some well yeah</text>
  <text start="303.16" dur="3.72">in fact they got a great deal more they</text>
  <text start="305.32" dur="3.27">have more influence on what happens in</text>
  <text start="306.88" dur="3.69">the world and anybody because they</text>
  <text start="308.59" dur="3.99">control the information that is fed to</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="4.2">people who make decisions like the</text>
  <text start="312.58" dur="4.23">president or the or the Chancellor in</text>
  <text start="314.77" dur="4.05">Germany where they you know Prime</text>
  <text start="316.81" dur="3.93">Minister in England all of them they are</text>
  <text start="318.82" dur="3.3">all can all the data is fed them is</text>
  <text start="320.74" dur="4.35">controlled by these intelligence</text>
  <text start="322.12" dur="6.75">agencies and that&amp;#39;s very that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="325.09" dur="5.22">scary you know which I think have</text>
  <text start="328.87" dur="6.9">private funding and our government</text>
  <text start="330.31" dur="6.99">funding in them anyway doing it for</text>
  <text start="335.77" dur="5.28">private purposes to influence elections</text>
  <text start="337.3" dur="7.05">Google comes to mind I want to ask you</text>
  <text start="341.05" dur="5.28">also you have beaten the FBI that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="344.35" dur="4.98">something that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s pretty darn rare</text>
  <text start="346.33" dur="4.56">they were forced to drop up there drop</text>
  <text start="349.33" dur="3.18">their charges against you if I recall</text>
  <text start="350.89" dur="2.76">correctly how did you do that is that</text>
  <text start="352.51" dur="6.39">something that you could teach others to</text>
  <text start="353.65" dur="7.71">do well first of all you have to back</text>
  <text start="358.9" dur="5.01">yourself up if you have exculpatory data</text>
  <text start="361.36" dur="4.17">or information that you want to ensure</text>
  <text start="363.91" dur="3.42">you keep you have to back yourself up</text>
  <text start="365.53" dur="3.93">nine ways to Sunday and don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="367.33" dur="4.32">give it to one or two people keep it too</text>
  <text start="369.46" dur="4.62">you know I like I&amp;#39;m backed up in about</text>
  <text start="371.65" dur="4.229">four other countries in the world</text>
  <text start="374.08" dur="4.709">out of the jurisdiction of the United</text>
  <text start="375.879" dur="4.32">States plus I&amp;#39;m backed up here in the in</text>
  <text start="378.789" dur="3.75">the United States about four or five</text>

  <text start="751.14" dur="5.88">because otherwise you know it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="753.45" dur="6.81">nation of men not laws I I blamed it all</text>
  <text start="757.02" dur="5.61">in Jerry Ford because when President</text>

  <text start="770.37" dur="4.11">guise of saying well the country needed</text>
  <text start="772.11" dur="5.25">to get this out of the way so I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="774.48" dur="4.169">part you know well what infect that said</text>

  <text start="784.26" dur="3.87">latitude to do whatever he thinks he</text>
  <text start="785.91" dur="4.35">needs to do and so if some of those</text>
  <text start="788.13" dur="3.3">include crimes they do it and with the</text>
  <text start="790.26" dur="2.97">understanding that the next president</text>
  <text start="791.43" dur="4.38">will want to do the same thing and</text>
  <text start="793.23" dur="4.65">therefore pardon them if they if it ever</text>
  <text start="795.81" dur="4.91">comes to a hit I&amp;#39;m gonna be nice with</text>
  <text start="797.88" dur="5.55">one president started arresting the next</text>
  <text start="800.72" dur="4.179">well that&amp;#39;s you see that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="803.43" dur="3.33">what I&amp;#39;m hoping here with President</text>
  <text start="804.899" dur="4.021">Trump I mean everybody was shooting at</text>
  <text start="806.76" dur="4.65">him why shouldn&amp;#39;t he shoot back and and</text>
  <text start="808.92" dur="4.83">bar there why shouldn&amp;#39;t bar hold people</text>
  <text start="811.41" dur="3">accountable to the law you know why</text>
  <text start="813.75" dur="3.36">shouldn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="814.41" dur="5.61">otherwise we had a department of just us</text>
  <text start="817.11" dur="7.8">and we the people are not part of it I</text>
  <text start="820.02" dur="7.14">love it now told Mike Pompeo to speak to</text>
  <text start="824.91" dur="5.19">you yeah there&amp;#39;s an article out by</text>
  <text start="827.16" dur="6.08">Robert Steele I think we both know him</text>
  <text start="830.1" dur="5.79">quoting with I shouldn&amp;#39;t I believe that</text>
  <text start="833.24" dur="3.94">you say that Pompeyo chose to ignore you</text>
  <text start="835.89" dur="3.42">after talking to you so if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="837.18" dur="3.42">mind me asking what happened and is this</text>
  <text start="839.31" dur="2.88">still something that we can have some</text>
  <text start="840.6" dur="3.36">hope are you gonna be in dialogue with</text>
  <text start="842.19" dur="3.27">President Trump and maybe help fix</text>
  <text start="843.96" dur="3.87">things</text>
  <text start="845.46" dur="3.75">well I would help him if he wanted if he</text>
  <text start="847.83" dur="4.71">wants my help I&amp;#39;ll give it to him for</text>
  <text start="849.21" dur="6">sure but when I and when I met with the</text>
  <text start="852.54" dur="7.11">pret with the director CIA director</text>
  <text start="855.21" dur="8.37">Pompey at the time 24th of October 2017</text>
  <text start="859.65" dur="5.82">I think was so you know he basically</text>
  <text start="863.58" dur="3.63">started out by saying the president said</text>
  <text start="865.47" dur="3.57">if I need if I wanted to learn some</text>
  <text start="867.21" dur="5.58">facts about Russia gate that he should</text>
  <text start="869.04" dur="5.61">talk to me so that&amp;#39;s what he did and so</text>
  <text start="872.79" dur="3.6">I told him everything factually that I</text>
  <text start="874.65" dur="4.95">could but I would point out this is</text>
  <text start="876.39" dur="4.62">really a bad indication and because and</text>
  <text start="879.6" dur="2.88">this is one of the things I told him</text>
  <text start="881.01" dur="3.75">while I was there I said his his</text>
  <text start="882.48" dur="4.65">agencies are lying to him and the</text>
  <text start="884.76" dur="4.5">president it is they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="887.13" dur="3.6">telling the truth to the to the peoples</text>
  <text start="889.26" dur="3.15">in positions of power in the United</text>
  <text start="890.73" dur="4.02">States government and this is really bad</text>
  <text start="892.41" dur="4.47">I mean because that&amp;#39;s how you get into</text>
  <text start="894.75" dur="4.77">things like slam dunk kill go kill a</text>
  <text start="896.88" dur="6">couple hundred thousand of Iraqis you</text>
  <text start="899.52" dur="6.03">know in a war or a Tonkin Gulf affair</text>
  <text start="902.88" dur="4.68">that never happened that LBJ used to go</text>
  <text start="905.55" dur="4.62">kill a couple million people these are</text>
  <text start="907.56" dur="5.34">the kinds of problems that occur or you</text>
  <text start="910.17" dur="4.35">go after Libya or a unity stabilize</text>
  <text start="912.9" dur="3.54">other countries by doing similar kinds</text>
  <text start="914.52" dur="3.93">of things and regime change in the</text>
  <text start="916.44" dur="5.85">Ukraine and things of that nature I mean</text>
  <text start="918.45" dur="6.15">this is yeah it&amp;#39;s just it just is people</text>
  <text start="922.29" dur="4.65">die because of those things I mean it</text>
  <text start="924.6" dur="5.7">said in lots of people so it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="926.94" dur="8.19">a really it&amp;#39;s really a bad indication of</text>
  <text start="930.3" dur="8.31">what our government has come to angry um</text>
  <text start="935.13" dur="5.58">if you if you had to give two minute you</text>
  <text start="938.61" dur="3.72">know spiel one advice or what he could</text>
  <text start="940.71" dur="4.32">do to maybe bring in the intelligence</text>
  <text start="942.33" dur="4.23">communities what do you think well one</text>
  <text start="945.03" dur="4.74">of the things he has to do is set up</text>
  <text start="946.56" dur="6.03">some kind of method of verifying what</text>
  <text start="949.77" dur="4.77">these agencies are really doing right</text>
  <text start="952.59" dur="3.39">now nobody in the government and any</text>
  <text start="954.54" dur="3.18">government the world none of them know</text>
  <text start="955.98" dur="4.29">what their secret intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="957.72" dur="3.72">are doing really they have to trust them</text>
  <text start="960.27" dur="3.78">to tell them the truth</text>
  <text start="961.44" dur="4.41">now most of it they do internally most</text>
  <text start="964.05" dur="3.09">of them they tell most of the truth but</text>
  <text start="965.85" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things they don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="967.14" dur="5.31">them like spying on them you know</text>
  <text start="970.35" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;ve been spying on the Congress of</text>
  <text start="972.45" dur="4.83">the United States all along but also in</text>
  <text start="974.82" dur="4.32">judges in the Supreme Court and in the</text>
  <text start="977.28" dur="3.21">Joint Chiefs of Staff</text>
  <text start="979.14" dur="3.48">and all the federal judges around the</text>
  <text start="980.49" dur="3.69">country and course the White House so</text>
  <text start="982.62" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s nothing new</text>
  <text start="984.18" dur="3.659">they&amp;#39;ve been doing that for quite some</text>
  <text start="985.95" dur="3.93">time they&amp;#39;re a hammer you look for a</text>
  <text start="987.839" dur="5.19">nail if you&amp;#39;re super spy you look for</text>
  <text start="989.88" dur="5.19">the biggest oh yeah that&amp;#39;s right buddy I</text>
  <text start="993.029" dur="3.841">mean they need to know what people who</text>
  <text start="995.07" dur="4.29">have power over them or thinking and</text>
  <text start="996.87" dur="4.409">planning to do to them so that it can</text>
  <text start="999.36" dur="4.349">maybe devise some way of diverting it</text>
  <text start="1001.279" dur="4.261">you know changing it modifying get it</text>
  <text start="1003.709" dur="4.5">getting them to think their way you know</text>
  <text start="1005.54" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s it it gives it gives you a good</text>
  <text start="1008.209" dur="5.031">idea what do you need to do if you know</text>
  <text start="1011.45" dur="4.74">what people are thinking or planning</text>
  <text start="1013.24" dur="6.219">yeah it does it&amp;#39;s the power of almost</text>
  <text start="1016.19" dur="5.97">being of God these people have and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1019.459" dur="4.38">seen that they abused it yeah and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1022.16" dur="4.919">what this book acquisition of data is</text>
  <text start="1023.839" dur="5.46">being used for common crimes inside the</text>
  <text start="1027.079" dur="3.51">United States and then of course they</text>
  <text start="1029.299" dur="2.76">have to do they can&amp;#39;t introduce that</text>
  <text start="1030.589" dur="3.901">data into a court of law because it</text>
  <text start="1032.059" dur="4.5">wasn&amp;#39;t acquired with the warrant this is</text>
  <text start="1034.49" dur="2.91">why the New York Times article came out</text>
  <text start="1036.559" dur="3.03">in the first place</text>
  <text start="1037.4" dur="4.35">Thomas Tamm who was a lawyer in the</text>
  <text start="1039.589" dur="4.681">Department of Justice who was</text>
  <text start="1041.75" dur="4.699">responsible and right for writing the</text>
  <text start="1044.27" dur="5.789">requests for warrants to the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="1046.449" dur="6.1">right he saw in the request coming in</text>
  <text start="1050.059" dur="4.591">from the FBI and CIA and NSA that they</text>
  <text start="1052.549" dur="4.231">already had taps on these people and</text>
  <text start="1054.65" dur="3.779">they were watching their phone calls and</text>
  <text start="1056.78" dur="3">emails and they could see he could see</text>
  <text start="1058.429" dur="3.931">they were using that data in them</text>
  <text start="1059.78" dur="4.8">warrant requests for this for the to go</text>
  <text start="1062.36" dur="4.05">to the FISA Court when in fact there was</text>
  <text start="1064.58" dur="3.27">a felonies already they were supposed to</text>
  <text start="1066.41" dur="4.29">have the warrant before they went</text>
  <text start="1067.85" dur="4.26">through the taps so hmm</text>
  <text start="1070.7" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s why he blew the whistle on the</text>
  <text start="1072.11" dur="3.48">New York Times he was known at the time</text>
  <text start="1074.09" dur="4.35">they raided us they knew that they were</text>
  <text start="1075.59" dur="4.89">that he did that you know they also knew</text>
  <text start="1078.44" dur="4.14">that because of the stellar wind program</text>
  <text start="1080.48" dur="4.35">that we had no connection with the New</text>
  <text start="1082.58" dur="5.64">York Times at all so they knew all this</text>
  <text start="1084.83" dur="5.67">didn&amp;#39;t advance so I mean oh this is a</text>
  <text start="1088.22" dur="4.11">this is the problem here when you have</text>
  <text start="1090.5" dur="5.04">all this kind of data on everybody its</text>
  <text start="1092.33" dur="4.92">power over everyone well okay so if they</text>
  <text start="1095.54" dur="4.019">you know and I don&amp;#39;t believe once the</text>
  <text start="1097.25" dur="4.35">weapon has been it&amp;#39;ll ever be uninvented</text>
  <text start="1099.559" dur="3.961">so if they have this kind of power how</text>
  <text start="1101.6" dur="4.14">do the people balance that Albany we</text>
  <text start="1103.52" dur="4.38">need some sort of intelligence on them</text>
  <text start="1105.74" dur="4.92">we need to have transparency for every</text>
  <text start="1107.9" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m saying they need to need</text>
  <text start="1110.66" dur="4.53">to have a way of verifying what</text>
  <text start="1112.97" dur="3.689">they are doing not what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1115.19" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re doing but what they really are</text>
  <text start="1116.659" dur="5.281">doing is there anyway in the question</text>
  <text start="1120.32" dur="3.83">but is there any sort of like open</text>
  <text start="1121.94" dur="5.04">source method that we could use to know</text>
  <text start="1124.15" dur="3.97">as the people what these intelligence</text>
  <text start="1126.98" dur="3.329">agencies are doing because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1128.12" dur="3.75">watching us no one&amp;#39;s watching them if</text>
  <text start="1130.309" dur="4.261">they don&amp;#39;t read it we want that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="1131.87" dur="4.439">no there&amp;#39;s no way you can&amp;#39;t see it an</text>
  <text start="1134.57" dur="5.9">open source</text>
  <text start="1136.309" dur="6.661">only only if you know how they talk and</text>
  <text start="1140.47" dur="5.17">the words I know and the way they word</text>
  <text start="1142.97" dur="6.78">things right to mask what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1145.64" dur="5.85">doing then you can maybe get a hint but</text>
  <text start="1149.75" dur="3.48">you wouldn&amp;#39;t really know until something</text>
  <text start="1151.49" dur="3.6">a compromise by a whistleblower</text>
  <text start="1153.23" dur="4.74">so something kind of like just out there</text>
  <text start="1155.09" dur="5.16">as an example you know hiding sa PE</text>
  <text start="1157.97" dur="4.829">level emails or something in the drafts</text>
  <text start="1160.25" dur="4.289">of an email account in another country</text>
  <text start="1162.799" dur="2.99">or something for communication something</text>
  <text start="1164.539" dur="4.711">like that maybe</text>
  <text start="1165.789" dur="6.191">yeah but they mostly see that they</text>
  <text start="1169.25" dur="5.58">operate in a closed Network it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1171.98" dur="4.71">connected to the World Wide Web and this</text>
  <text start="1174.83" dur="3.45">is a classified networks of its bulk</text>
  <text start="1176.69" dur="4.89">encrypted and all the data is post</text>
  <text start="1178.28" dur="4.8">passed under the bulk encryption so you</text>
  <text start="1181.58" dur="3.81">have to know how to get into the bulk</text>
  <text start="1183.08" dur="3.93">encryption to begin to tap it or put a</text>
  <text start="1185.39" dur="3.93">sniffer on it and see what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1187.01" dur="4.529">going by otherwise it&amp;#39;s just a bunch of</text>
  <text start="1189.32" dur="5.52">bits so is there any way to protect</text>
  <text start="1191.539" dur="5.911">yourself from being spied on no doc the</text>
  <text start="1194.84" dur="5.1">I out okay no you&amp;#39;re just in trouble</text>
  <text start="1197.45" dur="4.229">Trump you gotta save us brother yeah I I</text>
  <text start="1199.94" dur="4.68">bet there is a way to turn this around</text>
  <text start="1201.679" dur="5.851">and it takes a little bit of software</text>
  <text start="1204.62" dur="6.35">and that&amp;#39;s about it like for example you</text>
  <text start="1207.53" dur="7.769">can identify all pretty although all the</text>
  <text start="1210.97" dur="5.62">the US citizens in in in the network and</text>
  <text start="1215.299" dur="4.171">the phone network and also in the</text>
  <text start="1216.59" dur="4.89">digital network by the yeah and you</text>
  <text start="1219.47" dur="4.02">could just use the lose the data like</text>
  <text start="1221.48" dur="4.679">the phone numbers or the IP numbers or</text>
  <text start="1223.49" dur="4.35">the Mac numbers or any kind of those are</text>
  <text start="1226.159" dur="3.061">block allocated that blocks are known</text>
  <text start="1227.84" dur="3.449">you know you know where they are in the</text>
  <text start="1229.22" dur="4.079">world so it&amp;#39;s a matter of just staying</text>
  <text start="1231.289" dur="3.901">the block and just wiping all the stuff</text>
  <text start="1233.299" dur="6.021">out that&amp;#39;s in and that it said matches</text>
  <text start="1235.19" dur="5.609">that block and that&amp;#39;d be easy to do</text>
  <text start="1239.32" dur="4.81">trash can</text>
  <text start="1240.799" dur="5.76">yeah and the other way is to change what</text>
  <text start="1244.13" dur="4.59">kind of data they can collect and store</text>
  <text start="1246.559" dur="4.23">and that means you go to a focused</text>
  <text start="1248.72" dur="5.16">targeted approach which we did with thin</text>
  <text start="1250.789" dur="7.641">thread I mean we only pulled in like one</text>
  <text start="1253.88" dur="6.5">ten thousandth of the data that was it</text>
  <text start="1258.43" dur="5.37">and that&amp;#39;s all it was relevant to the</text>
  <text start="1260.38" dur="5.67">analyst and NSA the rest of it yeah it</text>
  <text start="1263.8" dur="4.2">was just yeah the rest of it was totally</text>
  <text start="1266.05" dur="3.87">irrelevant and so therefore what that</text>
  <text start="1268" dur="3.75">meant though was at any time because</text>
  <text start="1269.92" dur="4.65">they they use a what&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="1271.75" dur="5.82">dictionary select approaches selecting</text>
  <text start="1274.57" dur="4.71">data so if you have words or phrases and</text>
  <text start="1277.57" dur="4.62">a match the words or phrases that data</text>
  <text start="1279.28" dur="4.41">gets selected and that&amp;#39;s done every day</text>
  <text start="1282.19" dur="3.15">for every analyst they have their sets</text>
  <text start="1283.69" dur="4.38">of words and they all that data is</text>
  <text start="1285.34" dur="5.43">passed to them well when you&amp;#39;re sitting</text>
  <text start="1288.07" dur="5.79">there as an analyst and you see 40 to</text>
  <text start="1290.77" dur="5.67">50,000 items every day</text>
  <text start="1293.86" dur="4.62">and you start to go through them and</text>
  <text start="1296.44" dur="3.33">then you have to stop and find when you</text>
  <text start="1298.48" dur="4.02">find something have to stop and write a</text>
  <text start="1299.77" dur="4.23">record so that takes time away and then</text>
  <text start="1302.5" dur="3.57">so you only get through a maybe a</text>
  <text start="1304" dur="4.44">hundred or so items in each a day and</text>
  <text start="1306.07" dur="5.19">the other tens of thousands go right by</text>
  <text start="1308.44" dur="5.22">unobserved that&amp;#39;s why things have been</text>
  <text start="1311.26" dur="4.62">failing that&amp;#39;s why people have I mean</text>
  <text start="1313.66" dur="5.43">even the Snowden material not given</text>
  <text start="1315.88" dur="5.85">these are I gave these articles to from</text>
  <text start="1319.09" dur="4.589">the Snowden release to the House of</text>
  <text start="1321.73" dur="3.78">Lords in the UK saying here you know</text>
  <text start="1323.679" dur="3.421">your people and my five are saying we</text>
  <text start="1325.51" dur="3.69">you know we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re buried here we</text>
  <text start="1327.1" dur="3.38">can&amp;#39;t see the threat coming and then</text>
  <text start="1329.2" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;ve seen the same was true</text>
  <text start="1330.48" dur="3.579">overburdened by overload things like</text>
  <text start="1332.53" dur="4.139">that where articles written by analysts</text>
  <text start="1334.059" dur="4.381">inside NSA well that&amp;#39;s why they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1336.669" dur="4.711">stop the attacks that&amp;#39;s why people die</text>
  <text start="1338.44" dur="4.859">as a result it so I think more we are</text>
  <text start="1341.38" dur="4.62">more vulnerable now than we ever had</text>
  <text start="1343.299" dur="4.231">been sure and and that makes absolute</text>
  <text start="1346" dur="3.69">sense i mean they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re pulling in</text>
  <text start="1347.53" dur="3.96">all this data to spy on people probably</text>
  <text start="1349.69" dur="4.08">just using it for personal enrichment</text>
  <text start="1351.49" dur="4.14">and and blackmail purposes and kinda</text>
  <text start="1353.77" dur="4.8">like you&amp;#39;re saying is spy on the people</text>
  <text start="1355.63" dur="5.28">that trolling him you know personal</text>
  <text start="1358.57" dur="4.68">power sort of games and in it we the</text>
  <text start="1360.91" dur="4.649">people you know we we get none of that</text>
  <text start="1363.25" dur="5.1">it seems like these agencies primary</text>
  <text start="1365.559" dur="5.641">enemy is us not other countries or enemy</text>
  <text start="1368.35" dur="4.35">terrorists or anything like that well it</text>
  <text start="1371.2" dur="3.33">certainly seems to be in the trend I</text>
  <text start="1372.7" dur="4.17">mean they certainly go out of their way</text>
  <text start="1374.53" dur="4.29">to make sure that for example if we get</text>
  <text start="1376.87" dur="3.87">any information that&amp;#39;s relevant gets</text>
  <text start="1378.82" dur="4.02">shadow blocked or something like that or</text>
  <text start="1380.74" dur="4.41">controlled and the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="1382.84" dur="3.03">in that game with them so they&amp;#39;ll do</text>
  <text start="1385.15" dur="4.019">what they&amp;#39;re told</text>
  <text start="1385.87" dur="5.54">I mean that&amp;#39;s what Casey I think it was</text>
  <text start="1389.169" dur="5.901">who was that director of CIA for</text>
  <text start="1391.41" dur="7.72">President Reagan he said at one point</text>
  <text start="1395.07" dur="6.16">when we&amp;#39;ve been we&amp;#39;ve been infiltrating</text>
  <text start="1399.13" dur="4.77">the media for quite some time and when</text>
  <text start="1401.23" dur="4.319">seventy percent of it a 70 percent of</text>
  <text start="1403.9" dur="5.04">what is known as false you&amp;#39;ll know we</text>
  <text start="1405.549" dur="6.301">succeeded yeah that&amp;#39;s about today I mean</text>
  <text start="1408.94" dur="5.76">we we know Matt Olson it&amp;#39;s probably more</text>
  <text start="1411.85" dur="4.89">than 70% yeah it&amp;#39;s really it is yeah in</text>
  <text start="1414.7" dur="3.479">banned censored left and right I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1416.74" dur="5.4">a lawsuit coming up against them for</text>
  <text start="1418.179" dur="6.481">that myself so yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s peak or</text>
  <text start="1422.14" dur="4.56">well it&amp;#39;s peak crazy right now seems to</text>
  <text start="1424.66" dur="3">be but it seems to be failing I would</text>
  <text start="1426.7" dur="3.9">say also very under</text>
  <text start="1427.66" dur="4.71">optimistic about that yeah I think I</text>
  <text start="1430.6" dur="4.02">think some of the things that bar now</text>
  <text start="1432.37" dur="4.62">bar is that what bar does now from here</text>
  <text start="1434.62" dur="5.01">on out is whether he refers people to</text>
  <text start="1436.99" dur="3.9">grand juries for indictment if he does</text>
  <text start="1439.63" dur="3.24">that you&amp;#39;ll know he&amp;#39;s on the right track</text>
  <text start="1440.89" dur="6.06">if he doesn&amp;#39;t you know he&amp;#39;s given in</text>
  <text start="1442.87" dur="5.82">he&amp;#39;s a part of the mob now yeah so I</text>
  <text start="1446.95" dur="5.19">wanted to also ask you kind of my last</text>
  <text start="1448.69" dur="5.52">question is all my notes at least Amazon</text>
  <text start="1452.14" dur="5.04">has become you know they&amp;#39;re part of big</text>
  <text start="1454.21" dur="5.16">tech and sources others but I actually</text>
  <text start="1457.18" dur="3.96">put out a book recently and it did very</text>
  <text start="1459.37" dur="3.54">well all the way up to number two and</text>
  <text start="1461.14" dur="3.69">then they dropped three hundred or more</text>
  <text start="1462.91" dur="3.99">confirmed purchase reviews off of it to</text>
  <text start="1464.83" dur="4.88">mess with it right as ending McCabe&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1466.9" dur="8.52">deep state narrative book was trying to</text>
  <text start="1469.71" dur="8.8">stopped it but of course Amazon has</text>
  <text start="1475.42" dur="5.1">become basically the NSA Google on</text>
  <text start="1478.51" dur="3.42">steroids everything else I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1480.52" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re getting pretty powerful out</text>
  <text start="1481.93" dur="5.31">there they control I think about every</text>
  <text start="1484.09" dur="7.47">dollar on the internet do you think that</text>
  <text start="1487.24" dur="6.48">they are trying to become look at</text>
  <text start="1491.56" dur="4.17">private CIA I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1493.72" dur="4.67">right way to say it but their own NSA</text>
  <text start="1495.73" dur="5.49">their own bulk data collection power</text>
  <text start="1498.39" dur="5.41">sure they&amp;#39;re doing it as best that they</text>
  <text start="1501.22" dur="6.24">can with the resources and access they</text>
  <text start="1503.8" dur="6.84">have I would say that the difference</text>
  <text start="1507.46" dur="5.04">between them and then si has did NSA has</text>
  <text start="1510.64" dur="4.41">five other country for that countries</text>
  <text start="1512.5" dur="3.96">the fiber eyes group has also about</text>
  <text start="1515.05" dur="3.48">eight or nine other countries around the</text>
  <text start="1516.46" dur="4.08">world are participating in this room in</text>
  <text start="1518.53" dur="4.77">Europe and Asia</text>
  <text start="1520.54" dur="4.44">and so they have access to everything on</text>
  <text start="1523.3" dur="4.35">the fiber lines there is no dark fiber</text>
  <text start="1524.98" dur="5.73">they have that too so I mean if it goes</text>
  <text start="1527.65" dur="4.89">down the light in the in the cables they</text>
  <text start="1530.71" dur="4.77">they collect it session eyes that</text>
  <text start="1532.54" dur="5.19">reconstruct it you know and store it so</text>
  <text start="1535.48" dur="4.17">that means everything so everything that</text>
  <text start="1537.73" dur="4.41">Google has everything that Yahoo has</text>
  <text start="1539.65" dur="7.2">everything amazon has everything and</text>
  <text start="1542.14" dur="6.15">they do unilateral wiretap for example</text>
  <text start="1546.85" dur="3.93">if they if they use the companies that</text>
  <text start="1548.29" dur="4.58">the telecom companies to access cables</text>
  <text start="1550.78" dur="5.46">and get the data in the upstream program</text>
  <text start="1552.87" dur="5.14">and if that doesn&amp;#39;t work they they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1556.24" dur="3.6">use the government&amp;#39;s local governments</text>
  <text start="1558.01" dur="2.659">to go for their to their companies to</text>
  <text start="1559.84" dur="3.799">get the</text>
  <text start="1560.669" dur="6.21">access and and cooperation so they have</text>
  <text start="1563.639" dur="5.551">oh I mean between their local government</text>
  <text start="1566.879" dur="3.54">taking your taking their place and if</text>
  <text start="1569.19" dur="3.089">neither those things work then they</text>
  <text start="1570.419" dur="4.98">unilaterally tap the wires they go with</text>
  <text start="1572.279" dur="5.49">the USS Jimmy Carter under underwater or</text>
  <text start="1575.399" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;ll dig tunnels to get the cables</text>
  <text start="1577.769" dur="4.801">and and you know all they have to do is</text>
  <text start="1580.139" dur="4.29">tap them and like for example they had</text>
  <text start="1582.57" dur="4.41">the program muscular that tapped the pro</text>
  <text start="1584.429" dur="5.041">at the the data lines between the data</text>
  <text start="1586.98" dur="5.429">centers of yahoo and google and a few</text>
  <text start="1589.47" dur="4.74">others and so well you see this is the</text>
  <text start="1592.409" dur="4.61">this is the charade they&amp;#39;re doing they</text>
  <text start="1594.21" dur="5.49">have this 702 program the prism program</text>
  <text start="1597.019" dur="4.86">where they have under 702 they come in</text>
  <text start="1599.7" dur="4.26">with warrants asking for specific people</text>
  <text start="1601.879" dur="4.15">that&amp;#39;s to make it look like they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="1603.96" dur="4.199">baying the law but in the background</text>
  <text start="1606.029" dur="3.931">they have this unilateral tap on the</text>
  <text start="1608.159" dur="3.65">data lines between the data centers for</text>
  <text start="1609.96" dur="4.38">you go google and yahoo and all of them</text>
  <text start="1611.809" dur="5.95">so that when they backup all their data</text>
  <text start="1614.34" dur="6.329">at the end of the day guess what NSA has</text>
  <text start="1617.759" dur="4.081">all of their data so really they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1620.669" dur="2.49">have they could get rid of the prison</text>
  <text start="1621.84" dur="2.969">program they&amp;#39;ve already got that data</text>
  <text start="1623.159" dur="4.171">they don&amp;#39;t have they don&amp;#39;t need it but</text>
  <text start="1624.809" dur="4.921">it is a charade is here it makes it look</text>
  <text start="1627.33" dur="4.559">like we&amp;#39;re obeying the law when in fact</text>
  <text start="1629.73" dur="3.419">they&amp;#39;re violating everybody these rights</text>
  <text start="1631.889" dur="4.051">in the entire slaw</text>
  <text start="1633.149" dur="4.89">there is no law for them basically law</text>
  <text start="1635.94" dur="3.75">of the jungle seal me yeah people</text>
  <text start="1638.039" dur="4.38">respect yep</text>

  <text start="1698.22" dur="4.5">then they do it they perjure themselves</text>
  <text start="1699.81" dur="5.22">by doing a parallel construction right</text>
  <text start="1702.72" dur="5.13">and substituting that data that they</text>
  <text start="1705.03" dur="5.19">they acquire the data using the standard</text>
  <text start="1707.85" dur="4.08">policing techniques then they substitute</text>
  <text start="1710.22" dur="3.2">it for the NSA data in court or law and</text>
  <text start="1711.93" dur="5.07">say this is what we used to arrest them</text>
  <text start="1713.42" dur="5.08">that&amp;#39;s perjury you know so I mean this</text>
  <text start="1717" dur="3.96">is really they&amp;#39;re destroying our entire</text>
  <text start="1718.5" dur="4.56">judicial process with this program and</text>
  <text start="1720.96" dur="3.45">and and nobody seems to care they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1723.06" dur="2.97">Congress and I think we ought to fire</text>
  <text start="1724.41" dur="3.18">them all for that because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1726.03" dur="3.75">standing up for the Constitution that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1727.59" dur="3.84">for sure people have to understand on a</text>
  <text start="1729.78" dur="4.02">very simplified level that this kind of</text>
  <text start="1731.43" dur="5.61">power this kind of corruption it&amp;#39;s a few</text>
  <text start="1733.8" dur="4.35">decades to that&amp;#39;s you know mess up your</text>
  <text start="1737.04" dur="3.69">culture forever</text>
  <text start="1738.15" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s already done then and it can</text>
  <text start="1740.73" dur="5.34">be very quickly and it can obviously the</text>
  <text start="1743.31" dur="5.07">end result now just in this country has</text>
  <text start="1746.07" dur="4.32">changed yeah but you see if the</text>
  <text start="1748.38" dur="4.47">president read president Trump wants to</text>
  <text start="1750.39" dur="4.83">change that and stop it that would be</text>
  <text start="1752.85" dur="4.4">easy to do it will be easy to purge</text>
  <text start="1755.22" dur="5.7">those databases</text>
  <text start="1757.25" dur="5.53">with a little bit of software yeah so he</text>
  <text start="1760.92" dur="3.27">could on you could do that too the same</text>
  <text start="1762.78" dur="3.66">way I guess the hillary did with her</text>
  <text start="1764.19" dur="3.48">cell phones and stuff yeah and and guess</text>
  <text start="1766.44" dur="3.75">what that would that would a that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1767.67" dur="3.63">right hey oh she wouldn&amp;#39;t it that you</text>
  <text start="1770.19" dur="3.3">wouldn&amp;#39;t have to use a hammer or</text>
  <text start="1771.3" dur="4.65">anything you could use you know repeated</text>
  <text start="1773.49" dur="4.86">wipes okay but but I mean the point is</text>
  <text start="1775.95" dur="4.71">that once we did it for NSA we would do</text>
  <text start="1778.35" dur="4.44">a trawl the five eyes and all the other</text>
  <text start="1780.66" dur="3.87">countries involved in this so all at one</text>
  <text start="1782.79" dur="4.02">point because they&amp;#39;re the central</text>
  <text start="1784.53" dur="5.04">storage for all our data so the other</text>
  <text start="1786.81" dur="4.74">hand they use the xkeyscore program to</text>
  <text start="1789.57" dur="3.63">get into it or they use the IC reach if</text>
  <text start="1791.55" dur="3.54">there are five live&amp;#39;s they can use the</text>
  <text start="1793.2" dur="4.86">IC reach program to get even that</text>
  <text start="1795.09" dur="4.17">further into the database so once you</text>
  <text start="1798.06" dur="5.4">purge that database</text>
  <text start="1799.26" dur="5.52">nobody has it I love it yeah now what do</text>
  <text start="1803.46" dur="3.99">you think is gonna happen now that</text>
  <text start="1804.78" dur="5.7">Mueller is is done with his you know his</text>
  <text start="1807.45" dur="4.8">blockade if you will basically all it</text>
  <text start="1810.48" dur="3.42">really was I mean we even knew he he</text>
  <text start="1812.25" dur="3.14">knew that there was something quite a</text>
  <text start="1813.9" dur="6.44">while back I think about a year ago</text>
  <text start="1815.39" dur="4.95">there was no evidence so this was all</text>
  <text start="1821.15" dur="4.51">yeah and his latest statements was a it</text>
  <text start="1824.49" dur="3.24">was a way of trying to give the</text>
  <text start="1825.66" dur="2.46">Democrats the momentum to keep it going</text>
  <text start="1827.73" dur="3.48">too</text>
  <text start="1828.12" dur="5.85">20 that&amp;#39;s all I mean he and he had no</text>
  <text start="1831.21" dur="5.22">substance at all to it but I also I also</text>
  <text start="1833.97" dur="4.17">submitted as a part of the you know I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1836.43" dur="5.01">lie I like to take people into court if</text>
  <text start="1838.14" dur="5.4">I can so I submitted a sworn affidavit</text>
  <text start="1841.44" dur="5.13">in the indicate in there Roger stone</text>
  <text start="1843.54" dur="5.01">case and in there I said you know they</text>
  <text start="1846.57" dur="3.51">write I can prove that the data that</text>
  <text start="1848.55" dur="3.57">people put out there like GU super to</text>
  <text start="1850.08" dur="4.62">which was a major access point a major</text>
  <text start="1852.12" dur="5.04">dependency in the in the Rose ensign</text>
  <text start="1854.7" dur="4.14">indictment and also in the in the</text>
  <text start="1857.16" dur="3.84">Mueller report he&amp;#39;s claiming that goose</text>
  <text start="1858.84" dur="4.14">or two was a Russian agent yet all the</text>
  <text start="1861" dur="4.59">time stamping me had said he&amp;#39;s in he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1862.98" dur="5.1">in the East Coast the United States you</text>
  <text start="1865.59" dur="4.29">know and and plus we could prove that he</text>
  <text start="1868.08" dur="3.75">didn&amp;#39;t have a he didn&amp;#39;t hack he claimed</text>
  <text start="1869.88" dur="4.53">he had a hack that was one of Mueller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1871.83" dur="4.56">big big arguments that this guy was the</text>
  <text start="1874.41" dur="6.57">agent of Russians and he claimed he</text>
  <text start="1876.39" dur="7.29">gagged into the DNC well you know we</text>
  <text start="1880.98" dur="4.41">could prove it wasn&amp;#39;t a hack okay just</text>
  <text start="1883.68" dur="4.26">by the speeds a transfer that wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1885.39" dur="5.06">accommodate the web wouldn&amp;#39;t accommodate</text>
  <text start="1887.94" dur="4.77">them but also from the WikiLeaks data</text>
  <text start="1890.45" dur="5.74">which is the other point I put in my</text>
  <text start="1892.71" dur="7.2">affidavit posted by WikiLeaks they put</text>
  <text start="1896.19" dur="7.44">the DNC data from late May 23 a 25 26</text>
  <text start="1899.91" dur="5.97">May downloads and so that&amp;#39;s posted out</text>
  <text start="1903.63" dur="5.1">there well if you go look at it all</text>
  <text start="1905.88" dur="4.95">those files have the head the fact they</text>
  <text start="1908.73" dur="4.11">have evidence of that file format that</text>
  <text start="1910.83" dur="5.58">is the file allocation table format</text>
  <text start="1912.84" dur="6.6">where the last modified time is rounded</text>
  <text start="1916.41" dur="6.03">off to the nearest even number on all of</text>
  <text start="1919.44" dur="5.51">them so therefore that meant that and</text>
  <text start="1922.44" dur="5.82">that&amp;#39;s a program used to download to a</text>
  <text start="1924.95" dur="7.06">thumb drive or a CD ROM so it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1928.26" dur="5.82">storage and so that meant that all that</text>
  <text start="1932.01" dur="4.44">data to WikiLeaks like WikiLeaks had on</text>
  <text start="1934.08" dur="5.73">the DNC was transported physically</text>
  <text start="1936.45" dur="4.98">before they were able to post it so that</text>
  <text start="1939.81" dur="3.78">just shoots down the hacking a bad too</text>
  <text start="1941.43" dur="5.04">and that obviously that brings all sorts</text>
  <text start="1943.59" dur="5.34">of questions up about the very</text>
  <text start="1946.47" dur="9.72">suspicious death of Seth rich and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1948.93" dur="9.15">going on besides that kim.com has come</text>
  <text start="1956.19" dur="4.02">out publicly and said that he assisted</text>
  <text start="1958.08" dur="3.43">Seth rich and getting data that</text>
  <text start="1960.21" dur="3.429">WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="1961.51" dur="5.879">so was that illicit illicit the</text>
  <text start="1963.639" dur="6.02">recording of science I Hirsch the saying</text>
  <text start="1967.389" dur="6.211">that the FBI is a report to that effect</text>
  <text start="1969.659" dur="6.911">and also Craig Murray the former</text>
  <text start="1973.6" dur="4.799">ambassador has said that you know he met</text>
  <text start="1976.57" dur="4.14">somebody on the campus of American</text>
  <text start="1978.399" dur="6.931">University in Washington DC who assisted</text>
  <text start="1980.71" dur="7.26">in getting data to WikiLeaks had Julian</text>
  <text start="1985.33" dur="4.829">Assange they you know what he did that</text>
  <text start="1987.97" dur="3.48">it wasn&amp;#39;t a Russian hack and I know that</text>
  <text start="1990.159" dur="4.02">the Russians didn&amp;#39;t give him the data</text>
  <text start="1991.45" dur="6.18">and that that and he offered that</text>
  <text start="1994.179" dur="6.21">$20,000 reward on any information you</text>
  <text start="1997.63" dur="5.97">know toward the Seth rich murder yeah so</text>
  <text start="2000.389" dur="6.871">all the all the positive data says this</text>
  <text start="2003.6" dur="6.209">this wasn&amp;#39;t the Russians and and in fact</text>
  <text start="2007.26" dur="5.629">that some of that data had fingerprints</text>
  <text start="2009.809" dur="5.401">of Russians on it hacking into the DNC</text>
  <text start="2012.889" dur="4.481">that&amp;#39;s reminiscent of the marble</text>
  <text start="2015.21" dur="4.679">framework which is about seven out of</text>
  <text start="2017.37" dur="4.649">CIA where they can make it look like the</text>
  <text start="2019.889" dur="4.681">Russians did it now I work the Russian</text>
  <text start="2022.019" dur="4.591">problem for of almost 30 years and I got</text>
  <text start="2024.57" dur="4.229">to know these people like I had the back</text>
  <text start="2026.61" dur="4.289">on the back of my hand I knew that you</text>
  <text start="2028.799" dur="3.51">know so though anything they did I could</text>
  <text start="2030.899" dur="2.611">figure out fairly quickly what they were</text>
  <text start="2032.309" dur="2.071">doing with the whole objective was</text>
  <text start="2033.51" dur="2.879">mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="2034.38" dur="3.269">because you when you work people like</text>
  <text start="2036.389" dur="2.431">that and problems like that it for a</text>
  <text start="2037.649" dur="3.87">long period of time you get to</text>
  <text start="2038.82" dur="5.489">understand how they operate I didn&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="2041.519" dur="5.821">no respectable Russian would operate</text>
  <text start="2044.309" dur="5.431">like that they leaving telltale signs of</text>
  <text start="2047.34" dur="4.829">I was here I did this you know here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2049.74" dur="5.48">the guy who did you know created the KGB</text>
  <text start="2052.169" dur="5.851">or something you know no none of that no</text>
  <text start="2055.22" dur="6.28">respectable Aiden would do that yeah</text>
  <text start="2058.02" dur="5.49">that makes X not a Russian and I know</text>
  <text start="2061.5" dur="4.679">you know I don&amp;#39;t want to do detainer</text>
