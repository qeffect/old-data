  <text start="7.799" dur="4.92">recent debacle from Elon Musk I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="11.759" dur="3.21">actually give you a little bit of</text>
  <text start="12.719" dur="4.261">context here just it doesn&amp;#39;t take much</text>
  <text start="14.969" dur="3.931">Elon is unveiling Tesla&amp;#39;s new cyber</text>
  <text start="16.98" dur="3.83">truck which is a complete and abject</text>
  <text start="18.9" dur="4.379">failure much like most of his work</text>
  <text start="20.81" dur="4.719">oftentimes it&amp;#39;s beautiful I&amp;#39;ll give you</text>
  <text start="23.279" dur="4.74">that as cars look attractive but the</text>
  <text start="25.529" dur="5.611">quality the craftsmanship and also the</text>
  <text start="28.019" dur="5.04">subsequent deaths from these auto pilot</text>
  <text start="31.14" dur="4.71">driving mechanisms that they put in</text>
  <text start="33.059" dur="4.951">there which are not very good and are</text>
  <text start="35.85" dur="4.799">easily exploited are something to be</text>
  <text start="38.01" dur="5.04">concerned about as well and of course</text>
  <text start="40.649" dur="5.57">there&amp;#39;s a long and storied history with</text>
  <text start="43.05" dur="6.509">Elon Musk and his terrible Tesla company</text>
  <text start="46.219" dur="5.261">not to mention his accusations of being</text>
  <text start="49.559" dur="3.451">on acid I think it was from from the</text>
  <text start="51.48" dur="3.27">former rapper he was hanging out with I</text>
  <text start="53.01" dur="4.139">think it was Iggy Azalea but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="54.75" dur="4.289">know rappers very well frankly anyway</text>
  <text start="57.149" dur="3.57">there was an interesting spat there and</text>
  <text start="59.039" dur="3.721">of course it it got him another</text>
  <text start="60.719" dur="4.681">investigation I believe and of course he</text>
  <text start="62.76" dur="4.83">was tanked publicly for that one as well</text>
  <text start="65.4" dur="4.829">and didn&amp;#39;t help his stocks but my point</text>
  <text start="67.59" dur="5.819">is now to show his most recent debacle</text>
  <text start="70.229" dur="6.151">which is the cyber truck this not as</text>
  <text start="73.409" dur="4.621">attractive as usual with with Elon Musk</text>
  <text start="76.38" dur="3.629">vehicles this one looks kind of ugly</text>
  <text start="78.03" dur="3.72">just a personal opinion but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="80.009" dur="4.771">supposedly armored and bulletproof</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="5.13">windows and the whole nine yards so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="84.78" dur="4.14">gonna just mute myself and let you guys</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="5.09">see exactly how armored and bulletproof</text>
  <text start="88.92" dur="3.05">these things are</text>
  <text start="96.54" dur="38.23">well maybe that was a little too hard it</text>

  <text start="134.77" dur="6.66">that&amp;#39;s embarrassing now I I&amp;#39;m not trying</text>
  <text start="138.73" dur="5.25">to pick on on Elon Musk here or pick on</text>
  <text start="141.43" dur="4.55">Tesla but the point being is that this</text>
  <text start="143.98" dur="5.28">is a great example of just how</text>
  <text start="145.98" dur="5.92">embarrassingly inadequate this supposed</text>
  <text start="149.26" dur="4.02">geniuses at his job I mean he gets a lot</text>
  <text start="151.9" dur="2.91">of government money and yes he&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="153.28" dur="2.82">wealthy because of that but as he</text>
  <text start="154.81" dur="3.75">actually produced anything very</text>
  <text start="156.1" dur="5.94">successful I mean the cars are always</text>
  <text start="158.56" dur="5.31">behind promise overpriced I mean he&amp;#39;s</text>
