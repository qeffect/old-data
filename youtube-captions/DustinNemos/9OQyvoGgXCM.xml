  <text start="8.61" dur="5.31">for the news turn it off but if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="11.61" dur="5.64">looking for a potential opportunity</text>
  <text start="13.92" dur="5.58">I am losing the land that I bought in</text>
  <text start="17.25" dur="4.949">Tennessee for the real quick recap I I</text>
  <text start="19.5" dur="4.859">did a lot of research I went to</text>
  <text start="22.199" dur="3.451">Tennessee like multiple times and toured</text>
  <text start="24.359" dur="5.641">around had some very interesting</text>
  <text start="25.65" dur="7.56">experiences I ended up settling on a</text>
  <text start="30" dur="6.66">owner finance situation of with a good</text>
  <text start="33.21" dur="5.099">portion down about 11 acres or so I</text>
  <text start="36.66" dur="5.61">think it&amp;#39;s a little bit over 11 acres I</text>
  <text start="38.309" dur="8.041">have to check for I think we paid 33</text>
  <text start="42.27" dur="5.879">thousand in a in Laurens County near</text>
  <text start="46.35" dur="4.02">Lawrenceburg which is a you know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="48.149" dur="5.73">small city it&amp;#39;s an Amish country really</text>
  <text start="50.37" dur="4.86">cool a lot of like horses and and carts</text>
  <text start="53.879" dur="3.211">driving around everywhere and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="55.23" dur="3.36">there you know pitching their wares on</text>
  <text start="57.09" dur="2.67">the corners of the streets and stuff if</text>
  <text start="58.59" dur="4.469">you don&amp;#39;t mind the horse poop it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="59.76" dur="5.13">actually a really cool place but the</text>
  <text start="63.059" dur="4.651">land I was trying to sell it locally</text>
  <text start="64.89" dur="5.31">through a real estate agent but you know</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="4.88">it&amp;#39;s a pretty rural area and not a lot</text>
  <text start="70.2" dur="5.279">of you know bites or anything like that</text>
  <text start="72.59" dur="5.5">did have some interests but my loss</text>
  <text start="75.479" dur="4.231">could be your gain I figure what the</text>
  <text start="78.09" dur="3.84">heck I might as well mention it on</text>
  <text start="79.71" dur="3.56">YouTube because other people out there</text>
  <text start="81.93" dur="3.38">have a lot of the same interests as me</text>
  <text start="83.27" dur="5.32">obviously cuz you&amp;#39;re watching my channel</text>
  <text start="85.31" dur="4.96">and the really cool thing about this</text>
  <text start="88.59" dur="4.5">land that stood out to us there&amp;#39;s a few</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="4.77">things actually there&amp;#39;s no building code</text>
  <text start="93.09" dur="3.77">it&amp;#39;s one of the few places in the US</text>
  <text start="95.04" dur="4.86">where you don&amp;#39;t have this oppressive</text>
  <text start="96.86" dur="4.75">building code okay you know real fast</text>
  <text start="99.9" dur="3.42">for the building code people think that</text>
  <text start="101.61" dur="3.689">it protects you and gives you a better</text>
  <text start="103.32" dur="3.119">quality thing and most the time they</text>
  <text start="105.299" dur="2.941">don&amp;#39;t even get out of their cars they</text>
  <text start="106.439" dur="3.991">just drive by their window and check</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="4.199">some stuff off and and then that&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="110.43" dur="4.77">you don&amp;#39;t actually get improved safety</text>
  <text start="112.439" dur="4.021">or anything out of that you know they</text>
  <text start="115.2" dur="3.3">just want their money you know and they</text>
  <text start="116.46" dur="3.839">want to force you to do all of these</text>
  <text start="118.5" dur="4.89">things they&amp;#39;re not always essential so</text>
  <text start="120.299" dur="6.811">for someone who&amp;#39;s interested in you know</text>
  <text start="123.39" dur="6.179">possibly a DIY thing or a homestead or</text>
  <text start="127.11" dur="4.62">you know just freedom or even just</text>
  <text start="129.569" dur="4.201">saving money I mean you may not be able</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="4.56">to resell</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="5.58">a crap Shack or anything but if you have</text>
  <text start="136.29" dur="6.72">some skills my plan was to DIY my own</text>
  <text start="139.35" dur="5.76">cabin my own water system and my own</text>
  <text start="143.01" dur="4.83">electricity the only thing you need a</text>
  <text start="145.11" dur="6.69">permit for is the septic so it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="147.84" dur="6.21">a neat unique thing in that perspective</text>
  <text start="151.8" dur="5.94">there&amp;#39;s a few places in the country</text>
  <text start="154.05" dur="6.33">still with no building codes as for the</text>
  <text start="157.74" dur="5.88">land itself you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.38" dur="6.84">almost idyllic need to figure out kind</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="7.65">of a driveway situation but you can kind</text>
  <text start="167.22" dur="6.81">of get to there from the road but most</text>
  <text start="171.27" dur="4.5">of the land is up on a hill so we were</text>
  <text start="174.03" dur="3.36">just kind of parking at the bottom on</text>
  <text start="175.77" dur="4.05">the street and then walking all the way</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="3.87">up the hill carrying lumber and stuff</text>
  <text start="179.82" dur="2.94">because I have like a little cabin I</text>
  <text start="181.26" dur="3.84">halfway built there could be used as</text>
  <text start="182.76" dur="5.91">like a hunting thing there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="185.1" dur="6.36">game around there is a lot of farmers</text>
  <text start="188.67" dur="5.07">around there&amp;#39;s even coyotes in the area</text>
  <text start="191.46" dur="4.56">although that property&amp;#39;s like between a</text>
  <text start="193.74" dur="4.25">bunch of other houses and and dogs and</text>
  <text start="196.02" dur="6.06">stuff so you&amp;#39;re not too worried about it</text>
  <text start="197.99" dur="7.24">really cool neighbors you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="202.08" dur="4.47">just natural resources and such there</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="3.27">are some ticks on the property but</text>
  <text start="206.55" dur="4.62">there&amp;#39;s some pretty simple ways to</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="4.68">actually clear out ticks completely like</text>
  <text start="211.17" dur="5.1">tick tubes and stuff like that and</text>
  <text start="213.18" dur="4.92">guineas if you want but the the shape of</text>
  <text start="216.27" dur="3.78">the land you you should you Park at the</text>
  <text start="218.1" dur="3.78">bottom you go up the hill and I built a</text>
  <text start="220.05" dur="4.89">path and lined it with rocks that I dug</text>
  <text start="221.88" dur="4.77">up it was it was a project man we spent</text>
  <text start="224.94" dur="3.99">a whole summer there and then you know</text>
  <text start="226.65" dur="3.84">my my daughter was conceived and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.93" dur="3.99">like well we&amp;#39;re out of money we better</text>
  <text start="230.49" dur="3.93">get out of here I&amp;#39;m done not try to</text>
  <text start="232.92" dur="5.49">raise a baby out in the woods with no</text>
  <text start="234.42" dur="7.05">modern amenities but um it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a cool</text>
  <text start="238.41" dur="6.48">shape it&amp;#39;s actually a hill on both sides</text>
  <text start="241.47" dur="5.19">at the top of the hill there&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="244.89" dur="3.33">valley with two creeks that kind of</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="3.69">intertwine at the bottom I mean you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.22" dur="4.65">you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re not far from neighbors</text>
  <text start="250.35" dur="6.84">it&amp;#39;s 11 acres but you&amp;#39;re very private</text>
  <text start="252.87" dur="6.51">you&amp;#39;re very secluded it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="4.229">beautiful piece of land and other than</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="3.84">the driveway if you had to park at the</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="3.841">top that would be a heck of a driveway</text>
  <text start="263.22" dur="3.02">but if you&amp;#39;re ok with parking on the</text>
  <text start="265.26" dur="4.189">bottom and walking</text>
  <text start="266.24" dur="6.84">that little short thing of hills there</text>
  <text start="269.449" dur="5.581">are that short hill it could be a really</text>
  <text start="273.08" dur="3.899">nice opportunity for someone out there</text>
  <text start="275.03" dur="3.72">so we&amp;#39;re willing to let it go for less</text>
  <text start="276.979" dur="4.53">than we have in it just to recoup</text>
  <text start="278.75" dur="5.819">something and I figured you know this is</text>
  <text start="281.509" dur="5.31">a platform I have I might as well try to</text>
  <text start="284.569" dur="4.53">mention it before I just give it up and</text>
