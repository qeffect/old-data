  <text start="186.859" dur="5.011">so why would general Flynn just up and</text>
  <text start="189.859" dur="3.06">get rid of his lawyer right so I guess</text>
  <text start="191.87" dur="2.88">that means we were about to change</text>
  <text start="192.919" dur="4.921">strategy you&amp;#39;re getting rid of the weak</text>
  <text start="194.75" dur="4.829">guy that was there for now probably got</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="5.25">a ton of money out of poor general Flynn</text>
  <text start="199.579" dur="5.371">but um let&amp;#39;s see terminated their</text>
  <text start="203.09" dur="4.679">arrangement and has already hired new</text>
  <text start="204.95" dur="4.619">lawyers so Flynn they retired Luke I</text>
  <text start="207.769" dur="3.69">hope that a lot of people when I asked</text>
  <text start="209.569" dur="3.48">him to go by spoke all those times when</text>
  <text start="211.459" dur="4.081">I bought his book and I would like to</text>
  <text start="213.049" dur="5.791">think that we would help have paid for</text>
  <text start="215.54" dur="5.729">his new lawyer so Flynn a retired</text>
  <text start="218.84" dur="4.889">lieutenant general pled guilty December</text>
  <text start="221.269" dur="4.201">1st 2017 of course which we know now is</text>
  <text start="223.729" dur="3.09">a setup and they they actually ambushed</text>
  <text start="225.47" dur="3.239">him and he thought he was just having a</text>
  <text start="226.819" dur="4.081">conversation and McKay was behind that</text>
  <text start="228.709" dur="3.81">with his other buddy and then it was</text>
  <text start="230.9" dur="3.059">just a big to-do and then it turns out</text>
  <text start="232.519" dur="3.93">that they didn&amp;#39;t even really have</text>
  <text start="233.959" dur="5.49">anything on him and really it was almost</text>
  <text start="236.449" dur="5.671">as though he&amp;#39;s walked into this on</text>
  <text start="239.449" dur="5.641">purpose it&amp;#39;s almost like that or they</text>
  <text start="242.12" dur="4.47">just they really tried to set him up and</text>
  <text start="245.09" dur="4.38">crush his life which seems to be the</text>
  <text start="246.59" dur="5.579">case and he&amp;#39;s got plenty of things I</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="4.349">think coming back at them now that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.169" dur="2.371">in a different legal setting they look</text>
  <text start="253.819" dur="3.001">back then</text>
  <text start="254.54" dur="3.84">the game was really rigged against us</text>
  <text start="256.82" dur="3.75">now we&amp;#39;ve gotten much more the court</text>
  <text start="258.38" dur="4.74">system back in our own control that</text>
  <text start="260.57" dur="4.11">being constitutional control not</text>
  <text start="263.12" dur="3.12">necessarily conservative although the</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="4.229">yeah the conservative judges being in</text>
  <text start="266.24" dur="4.29">the courts now getting stacked in so</text>

  <text start="316.479" dur="6.93">occurred here both with mr. Blumenthal</text>
  <text start="318.819" dur="6.45">and mrs. Clinton or slen so this is very</text>
  <text start="323.409" dur="2.28">interesting with Sidney Blumenthal as</text>

  <text start="350.799" dur="4.23">weapon we want even if it&amp;#39;s a bazooka</text>
  <text start="352.559" dur="4.36">you need a bazooka to defend your home</text>
  <text start="355.029" dur="4.17">you probably can have much of a home</text>
  <text start="356.919" dur="4.53">left but look if you&amp;#39;ve got a whole gang</text>
  <text start="359.199" dur="3.72">of like ms-13 outside and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="362.919" dur="5.04">you do right so maybe that&amp;#39;s a good idea</text>
  <text start="365.979" dur="3.631">I don&amp;#39;t know but the founding fathers</text>
  <text start="367.959" dur="4.591">set us up to the Second Amendment for a</text>

  <text start="374.139" dur="3.9">Amendment were on the government from</text>
  <text start="376.079" dur="3.971">suppressing alright so that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="378.039" dur="3.42">telling personally I think we should be</text>
  <text start="380.05" dur="3.359">allowed to own tanks I just don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="381.459" dur="4.61">there&amp;#39;s much of a reason to unless of</text>
  <text start="383.409" dur="6.57">course our borders get overrun and were</text>
  <text start="386.069" dur="4.96">invaded by whatever maybe ms-13 people</text>

  <text start="418.629" dur="4.35">will win and first of all like that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="421.569" dur="2.131">kind of an odd thing to say because</text>
  <text start="422.979" dur="2.311">you&amp;#39;re not</text>
