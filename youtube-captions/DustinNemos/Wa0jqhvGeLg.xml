  <text start="208.86" dur="11.02">alright so moving on we also have and</text>
  <text start="218.41" dur="3.51">this is very interesting folks the</text>
  <text start="219.88" dur="6.96">Washington Post and it seems like the</text>
  <text start="221.92" dur="8.61">mainstream media are defending or sort</text>
  <text start="226.84" dur="6.48">of like eulogizing I guess you&amp;#39;d say</text>
  <text start="230.53" dur="5.33">they do the eulogizing the leader of</text>
  <text start="233.32" dur="5.58">Isis as a austere religious leader and</text>
  <text start="235.86" dur="4.42">even a potential football player or</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="3.57">something like a pro footballer or</text>
  <text start="240.28" dur="3.81">something I guess what beforehand I</text>
  <text start="242.47" dur="3.54">don&amp;#39;t know what that&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="244.09" dur="4.47">I don&amp;#39;t follow sports that much but I</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="5.7">feel like politics with his real war and</text>
  <text start="248.56" dur="5.52">sports is like play war but to see him</text>
  <text start="251.71" dur="4.8">go down like this and in such fears</text>
  <text start="254.08" dur="4.17">certainly gonna demoralize Isis what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.51" dur="5.37">left of them not that there&amp;#39;s much left</text>
  <text start="258.25" dur="7.14">but the point that the fake news hates</text>
  <text start="261.88" dur="5.49">Trump&amp;#39;s so much so much that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.39" dur="4.41">gonna do things like this and actually</text>
  <text start="267.37" dur="5.52">try to twist the leader of Isis into</text>
  <text start="269.8" dur="5.7">being the the antihero or some sort of</text>
  <text start="272.89" dur="6.15">underdog character like that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="275.5" dur="5.82">pretty sick now serial liar and linker</text>
  <text start="279.04" dur="4.41">Adam Schiff was not briefed on this raid</text>
  <text start="281.32" dur="4.35">on the Isis compound why of course</text>
  <text start="283.45" dur="5.19">because he leaks everyone in DC is</text>
  <text start="285.67" dur="5.13">leaking all the time so they&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="288.64" dur="4.14">have their pretend impeachment trials</text>
  <text start="290.8" dur="3.78">while President Trump conducts real work</text>
  <text start="292.78" dur="4.11">and they don&amp;#39;t get to find out about it</text>
  <text start="294.58" dur="3.63">until afterwards because as we know</text>
  <text start="296.89" dur="4.2">President Trump does not like to</text>
  <text start="298.21" dur="5.61">announce to the enemy what&amp;#39;s coming so</text>
  <text start="301.09" dur="6.12">flashback never forget Isis terror</text>
  <text start="303.82" dur="5.19">leader Abu Bakr al-baghdadi was already</text>
  <text start="307.21" dur="6.27">a prisoner of the US before until Obama</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="7.71">released him back in 2009 so you know</text>
  <text start="313.48" dur="6.06">President Obama was in almost like a</text>
  <text start="316.72" dur="4.05">Muslim communist Manchurian Candidate he</text>
  <text start="319.54" dur="4.32">was really in there to just screw over</text>
  <text start="320.77" dur="5.21">our country weaken our military and sell</text>
  <text start="323.86" dur="6.65">us out piece by piece with Hillary</text>
  <text start="325.98" dur="6.93">well this is this is a very strange sort</text>
  <text start="330.51" dur="5.16">of cultural commentary here this guy who</text>
  <text start="332.91" dur="6.57">identifies as a trans woman even though</text>
  <text start="335.67" dur="6.23">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s bald with a beard very hefty</text>
  <text start="339.48" dur="5.07">beard apparently goes into a Taco Bell</text>
  <text start="341.9" dur="5.49">douse as a woman with gasoline and then</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="5.61">lights her on the fire takes off running</text>
  <text start="347.39" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s just a pretty scary thing to see</text>
  <text start="350.16" dur="4.08">happening and random like that and</text>
  <text start="352.13" dur="5.29">actually happened in Florida where I</text>
  <text start="354.24" dur="5.34">live now now this is also a very</text>
  <text start="357.42" dur="4.17">important and interesting clip I want</text>
  <text start="359.58" dur="3.3">you guys to see this with Sidney Powell</text>
  <text start="361.59" dur="3.24">and just kind of listen to this</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="4.14">particular part of it it&amp;#39;s very relevant</text>
  <text start="364.83" dur="4.19">right now</text>
  <text start="367.02" dur="4.89">where is the evidence then that that</text>
  <text start="369.02" dur="4.39">conversation and that those words or the</text>
  <text start="371.91" dur="2.01">effect of those words actually took</text>
  <text start="373.41" dur="4.86">place</text>
  <text start="373.92" dur="6.78">I it cannot reveal the source right now</text>
  <text start="378.27" dur="4.38">but I do have a very good source for</text>
  <text start="380.7" dur="3.48">that information and you believe the</text>
  <text start="382.65" dur="3.98">Department of Justice is with Hayes</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="4.65">withholding that information from you I</text>
  <text start="386.63" dur="5.02">believe the Department of Justice is</text>
  <text start="388.83" dur="5.31">withholding a lot of information as is</text>
  <text start="391.65" dur="4.5">mr. clapper mr. Brennan and all of you</text>
  <text start="394.14" dur="4.32">all of the people who participated in</text>
  <text start="396.15" dur="4.53">the complete setup of General Michael</text>
  <text start="398.46" dur="3.9">Flynn you know we have found additional</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="3.72">text messages that the government</text>
  <text start="402.36" dur="4.65">suppressed including one where agent</text>
  <text start="404.4" dur="5.13">struck indicates he knows it&amp;#39;s a pretext</text>
  <text start="407.01" dur="5.19">to go interview general Flynn they knew</text>
  <text start="409.53" dur="4.68">there was no Logan Act violation they</text>
  <text start="412.2" dur="4.44">exonerated him completely of being an</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="4.86">agent of Russia by the end of January</text>
  <text start="416.64" dur="4.47">and yet mr. Comey still runs to the</text>
  <text start="419.07" dur="3.99">White House on February 14th and</text>
  <text start="421.11" dur="4.02">conjures up the entire obstruction of</text>
  <text start="423.06" dur="3.51">justice narrative against the president</text>
  <text start="425.13" dur="4.53">when Flynn had been cleared of</text>
  <text start="426.57" dur="5.46">everything long before that we also have</text>
  <text start="429.66" dur="4.86">information that the agents did</text>
  <text start="432.03" dur="4.68">manipulate the 302 you know it was long</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="4.29">in a quote deliberative State as they</text>
  <text start="436.71" dur="5.07">called it which is highly unusual in and</text>
  <text start="438.81" dur="5.43">of itself we attached as Exhibit 11 to</text>
  <text start="441.78" dur="5.79">our document a comparison of the</text>
  <text start="444.24" dur="5.01">February 10th in February 11th 302s that</text>
  <text start="447.57" dur="3.66">show the addition of substantial</text>
  <text start="449.25" dur="3.54">additional claims that were not in there</text>
  <text start="451.23" dur="4.23">before and are not supported by the</text>
  <text start="452.79" dur="4.89">notes which we also attach as exhibits</text>
  <text start="455.46" dur="4.47">to the document so people can go to the</text>
  <text start="457.68" dur="5.04">actual document and read it and see a</text>
  <text start="459.93" dur="5.07">lot for themselves it&amp;#39;s extremely</text>
  <text start="462.72" dur="4.67">concerning it&amp;#39;s outrageous government</text>
  <text start="465" dur="5">misconduct the agents deliberately</text>
  <text start="467.39" dur="5.41">calculated and met to plan and</text>
  <text start="470" dur="5.26">strategize how to ambush interview</text>
  <text start="472.8" dur="4.29">general Flynn without letting him know</text>
  <text start="475.26" dur="4.26">he was officially under any kind of</text>
  <text start="477.09" dur="4.98">criminal investigation to keep him</text>
  <text start="479.52" dur="4.77">relaxed and they wanted to be seen as</text>
  <text start="482.07" dur="4.32">allies when in fact they knew exactly</text>
  <text start="484.29" dur="5.34">what he had said in his conversations</text>
  <text start="486.39" dur="5.7">and they intended to create a situation</text>
  <text start="489.63" dur="4.38">in which anything he said could be used</text>
  <text start="492.09" dur="3.96">against him later as a false statement</text>
  <text start="494.01" dur="4.17">without any warnings to that effect</text>
  <text start="496.05" dur="4.02">whatsoever and real quickly I&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="498.18" dur="4.29">go here but you believe that Lisa</text>
  <text start="500.07" dur="5.13">was the one that actually edited the</text>
  <text start="502.47" dur="5.93">so-called 302 which is the summary of</text>
  <text start="505.2" dur="6.3">the interview with general Flynn correct</text>
  <text start="508.4" dur="5.35">well she admitted making some edits of</text>
  <text start="511.5" dur="4.41">it I do not know and we do not know yet</text>
  <text start="513.75" dur="4.77">until we get the metadata from the FBI</text>
