  <text start="65.69" dur="6.78">so um we have a quote here Flynn has</text>
  <text start="69.619" dur="4.92">requested records of Colonel James Baker</text>
  <text start="72.47" dur="3.96">because he was helpers handler in the</text>
  <text start="74.539" dur="5.341">office of net assessment in the Pentagon</text>

  <text start="95.6" dur="5.76">the effect of take the kill shot on</text>
  <text start="97.85" dur="5.82">Flynn it cannot escape mention that the</text>

  <text start="103.67" dur="6.03">Kissel yak calls the government has</text>
  <text start="105.92" dur="5.19">denied to the defense yeah because they</text>
  <text start="109.7" dur="4.349">you know you can have it all and it can</text>
  <text start="111.11" dur="5.25">all be leaked out from you know the the</text>
  <text start="114.049" dur="4.051">left but you can&amp;#39;t do anything with</text>
  <text start="116.36" dur="3.78">anything that might actually defend or</text>
  <text start="118.1" dur="3.99">exonerate that none of that&amp;#39;s allowed</text>
  <text start="120.14" dur="4.04">because this is not a search for justice</text>
  <text start="122.09" dur="6.899">this is a witch-hunt looking for a crime</text>
  <text start="124.18" dur="6.43">this is a a broad net looking for</text>
  <text start="128.989" dur="3.421">something just hoping to get something</text>
  <text start="130.61" dur="3.3">to crush an enemy with because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.41" dur="5.09">the kind of people were dealing with</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="6.139">here psychopaths and power politicians</text>
  <text start="137.5" dur="5.049">but then again I repeat myself</text>
  <text start="140.049" dur="4.961">Republican senators introduced bill to</text>
  <text start="142.549" dur="4.321">move ninety percent of federal jobs out</text>
  <text start="145.01" dur="3.81">of DC now this is not the first time</text>
  <text start="146.87" dur="3.899">this idea has been floated and it is</text>
  <text start="148.82" dur="3.87">still a good idea I don&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="150.769" dur="5.281">gonna get anywhere not this time but</text>
  <text start="152.69" dur="5.58">under Trump I bet you this will happen I</text>
  <text start="156.05" dur="3.9">do I think this might actually have</text>
  <text start="158.27" dur="3.24">and under trompe he is a strong link</text>
  <text start="159.95" dur="4.02">sort of central government kind of guy</text>
  <text start="161.51" dur="4.98">in a sense but he&amp;#39;s also very much like</text>
  <text start="163.97" dur="5.79">a decentralized and checks and balances</text>
  <text start="166.49" dur="7.71">constitutional guy so you know I there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.76" dur="7.32">very practical and very quick benefit in</text>
  <text start="174.2" dur="4.47">terms of draining the swamp that you</text>
  <text start="177.08" dur="3.3">could do with this he would decentralize</text>
  <text start="178.67" dur="3.48">the swamp and that alone would do quite</text>
  <text start="180.38" dur="4.17">a bit and you would and from a more</text>
  <text start="182.15" dur="5.43">mainstream perspective even which I</text>
  <text start="184.55" dur="5.52">guess that is mainstream now but from a</text>
  <text start="187.58" dur="5.04">different perspective you you could also</text>
  <text start="190.07" dur="4.38">put government people back in touch with</text>
  <text start="192.62" dur="3.9">their communities in a sense like it</text>
  <text start="194.45" dur="3.84">wouldn&amp;#39;t all be concentrated in DC where</text>
  <text start="196.52" dur="3.99">like 90 something percent voted Hillary</text>
  <text start="198.29" dur="3.87">would be spread out among other cultures</text>
  <text start="200.51" dur="2.64">and communities and it wouldn&amp;#39;t be five</text>
  <text start="202.16" dur="3.87">over country the right</text>
  <text start="203.15" dur="6.84">it wouldn&amp;#39;t be these bastions of liberal</text>
  <text start="206.03" dur="7.17">elitism surrounded by you know homeless</text>
  <text start="209.99" dur="5.67">and waste and refuse and disease because</text>
  <text start="213.2" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re so corrupt and they lean on</text>
  <text start="215.66" dur="5.25">everyone around them and and no one is</text>
  <text start="218" dur="5.67">safe and society falls apart be it from</text>
  <text start="220.91" dur="4.44">drugs that have long-term effects to</text>
  <text start="223.67" dur="3.87">society and consequences and destroy</text>
  <text start="225.35" dur="3.51">people turn their lives upside down make</text>
  <text start="227.54" dur="3.33">it hard for them to get jobs and be</text>
  <text start="228.86" dur="3.33">productive members of society and you</text>
  <text start="230.87" dur="3.65">see all these on the streets over there</text>
  <text start="232.19" dur="5.19">or just corruption</text>
  <text start="234.52" dur="4.63">there&amp;#39;s so many and also of course just</text>
  <text start="237.38" dur="4.05">socialism and communism they did the</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="5.49">idea it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s leading people to</text>
  <text start="241.43" dur="5.01">destruction and this seems to be a</text>
  <text start="244.64" dur="4.98">recurring pattern in democratic</text>
  <text start="246.44" dur="5.7">strongholds like DC by the way DC is a</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="4.8">democratic stronghold 90 I think 496</text>
  <text start="252.14" dur="5.069">percent voted Hillary remember that so</text>
  <text start="254.42" dur="4.08">we also have and this is a very jump</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="3.15">into a different topic although Hillary</text>
  <text start="258.5" dur="4.02">you know maybe not she&amp;#39;s a good segue</text>
  <text start="260.359" dur="4.981">into any child trafficking conversation</text>
  <text start="262.52" dur="6.21">an Arkansas Senator on CPS kidnappings</text>
  <text start="265.34" dur="7.35">no horror movie ever prepared you for</text>
  <text start="268.73" dur="6.689">this that&amp;#39;s a quote this is senator Alan</text>
  <text start="272.69" dur="5.25">Clark and this is a great read it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="275.419" dur="5.461">very is from a mainstream perspective</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s not human trafficking you know</text>
  <text start="280.88" dur="5.37">Satanism and all that other stuff that</text>
  <text start="282.74" dur="5.4">and that does happen yes in fact there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.25" dur="3.27">I think there&amp;#39;s a thing on that was</text>
  <text start="288.14" dur="4.08">Declassified about a group called the</text>
  <text start="289.52" dur="4.83">finders which the FBI and see</text>
  <text start="292.22" dur="3.84">I had investigated and it just shut it</text>
  <text start="294.35" dur="3.72">been shut down because of national</text>
  <text start="296.06" dur="3.78">security reasons and this group was out</text>
  <text start="298.07" dur="4.23">there like kidnapping trading buying</text>
  <text start="299.84" dur="4.59">whatever they could do get kids and then</text>
  <text start="302.3" dur="4.32">this group would have the kids and and</text>
  <text start="304.43" dur="3.69">not only would they engage in sexual</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="2.96">acts and molest them they would take</text>
  <text start="308.12" dur="8.31">pictures of them they would have a</text>
  <text start="309.58" dur="7.96">something called a a a nude actors party</text>
  <text start="316.43" dur="2.79">or something like that where they they</text>
  <text start="317.54" dur="3.3">act like their favorite celebrity but</text>
  <text start="319.22" dur="3.03">their nude and they take pictures of</text>
  <text start="320.84" dur="2.73">them and things like that they would</text>
  <text start="322.25" dur="2.94">have them kill animals or they would be</text>
  <text start="323.57" dur="2.85">around animals when they were killed</text>
  <text start="325.19" dur="3.21">like they would kill the animals in</text>
  <text start="326.42" dur="3.66">front of them to desensitize them to</text>
  <text start="328.4" dur="3.18">death I don&amp;#39;t know maybe you&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="330.08" dur="3.51">to train an assassin or something maybe</text>
  <text start="331.58" dur="5.91">you&amp;#39;re just trying to to break the will</text>
  <text start="333.59" dur="7.14">maybe you&amp;#39;re trying to create some sort</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="4.95">of like satanic or ritualistic ceremony</text>
  <text start="340.73" dur="4.02">I I have no idea but these are the facts</text>
  <text start="342.44" dur="4.56">that were reported and then covered up</text>
  <text start="344.75" dur="4.35">so that&amp;#39;s the finders group so that kind</text>
  <text start="347" dur="5.87">of stuff does happen but in this case it</text>
  <text start="349.1" dur="6.54">was more about over abuse of the system</text>
  <text start="352.87" dur="4.6">you know good people seeing kind of like</text>
  <text start="355.64" dur="5.31">the hammer seeing the nail everywhere so</text>
  <text start="357.47" dur="5.16">for CPS for example you know they have</text>
  <text start="360.95" dur="3">this sort of secrecy factor and they</text>
  <text start="362.63" dur="2.91">have all this power where they can just</text>
  <text start="363.95" dur="3.36">hurt you and take your children and</text>
  <text start="365.54" dur="3.06">destroy your life and they have all the</text>
  <text start="367.31" dur="5.76">secrecy where you have very little</text>
  <text start="368.6" dur="6.54">defense and at the same point not only</text>
  <text start="373.07" dur="7.02">does everything seem like a nail to a</text>
  <text start="375.14" dur="6.63">hammer but a lot of times and then of</text>
  <text start="380.09" dur="4.41">course the metrics back this up when it</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="4.8">says right here 89% of the reports to</text>
  <text start="384.5" dur="5.25">the child abuse hotline plotline came</text>
  <text start="386.57" dur="4.71">back unfounded 89% of those investigated</text>
  <text start="389.75" dur="3.21">home searched children taken from you</text>
  <text start="391.28" dur="3.3">and interviewed and asked some pretty</text>
  <text start="392.96" dur="3.12">incredible questions according to the</text>
  <text start="394.58" dur="3.48">system itself didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong</text>
  <text start="396.08" dur="4.68">but right at fifty percent of those who</text>
  <text start="398.06" dur="5.04">are found guilty and appeal the true</text>
  <text start="400.76" dur="5.43">findings are exonerated so things like</text>
  <text start="403.1" dur="4.65">that it&amp;#39;s very bad at protecting</text>
  <text start="406.19" dur="3.57">children now though I&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="407.75" dur="3.93">everyone in CPS is bad or child</text>
  <text start="409.76" dur="6.719">protective whatever they call it in your</text>
  <text start="411.68" dur="6.54">state I&amp;#39;m saying that there is a lot of</text>
  <text start="416.479" dur="3.481">power there and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="418.22" dur="6.31">corruption there and these two things</text>
  <text start="419.96" dur="8.14">attract pedophiles like moths to flame</text>
  <text start="424.53" dur="5.85">and you know politicians psychopaths and</text>
  <text start="428.1" dur="4.74">pedophiles you know they like to get in</text>
  <text start="430.38" dur="3.66">positions of power especially you know</text>
  <text start="432.84" dur="2.94">there were the pedophiles especially</text>
  <text start="434.04" dur="4.29">over children you know they may go into</text>
  <text start="435.78" dur="5.01">more like the priests or the or the the</text>
  <text start="438.33" dur="3.75">daycare or the babysitter or something</text>
  <text start="440.79" dur="4.68">like that whereas a politician would</text>
  <text start="442.08" dur="5.52">want to have the power but still people</text>
  <text start="445.47" dur="3.6">seek out what they want and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="447.6" dur="3.54">bad thing here we have to be better</text>
  <text start="449.07" dur="4.95">protecting our children from our</text>
  <text start="451.14" dur="4.89">government and from others just in</text>
  <text start="454.02" dur="5.16">general and that means a strong family</text>
  <text start="456.03" dur="4.44">unit a a strong two-parent if possible</text>
  <text start="459.18" dur="3.239">household because that&amp;#39;s how you give</text>
  <text start="460.47" dur="4.199">the child the best possible chance in</text>
  <text start="462.419" dur="5.011">their in their world in the future for a</text>
  <text start="464.669" dur="4.021">future and in just a strong family unit</text>
  <text start="467.43" dur="3.96">because that&amp;#39;s the best thing to protect</text>
  <text start="468.69" dur="4.89">children in fact most statistics will</text>
  <text start="471.39" dur="3.81">bear this out a lot of the child abuse</text>
  <text start="473.58" dur="4.65">the sexual abuse even the violence and</text>
  <text start="475.2" dur="4.65">physical abuse which you know I had a</text>
  <text start="478.23" dur="3.45">single mom growing up and I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="479.85" dur="3.54">plenty of physical abuse not hopefully I</text>
  <text start="481.68" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t think I was molested but plenty of</text>
  <text start="483.39" dur="4.26">actual violence and stuff a lot of that</text>
  <text start="486.09" dur="3.27">stuff happens from the step dad&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="487.65" dur="3.329">the real father such very it&amp;#39;s much more</text>
  <text start="489.36" dur="4.92">rare for a real father to be like that</text>
  <text start="490.979" dur="6.061">not saying it doesn&amp;#39;t happen but anyway</text>
  <text start="494.28" dur="4.17">so we&amp;#39;re gonna move on and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="497.04" dur="3">good to see that some of the like the</text>
  <text start="498.45" dur="3.18">GOP people are now getting involved in</text>
  <text start="500.04" dur="2.97">this human trafficking child trafficking</text>
  <text start="501.63" dur="3.27">stuff even if it&amp;#39;s on the periphery</text>
  <text start="503.01" dur="3.719">because it&amp;#39;s getting closer</text>
  <text start="504.9" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s that Overton Window I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="506.729" dur="4.141">talk about that shifts every once in a</text>
  <text start="508.5" dur="5.76">while and and Trump is a good example he</text>
  <text start="510.87" dur="6.24">created this mega term that that sort of</text>
  <text start="514.26" dur="5.579">shifted the whole conversation into a</text>
  <text start="517.11" dur="4.77">different world and then he created this</text>
  <text start="519.839" dur="3.871">fake news or I don&amp;#39;t think he created it</text>
  <text start="521.88" dur="3.99">but he popularized the fake news term</text>
  <text start="523.71" dur="4.59">and now the Overton Window has shifted</text>
  <text start="525.87" dur="4.35">now everyone knows that it&amp;#39;s not only</text>
  <text start="528.3" dur="3.87">doing no it&amp;#39;s fake news but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.22" dur="3.57">perfectly normal conversational topic</text>
  <text start="532.17" dur="3.99">right because it&amp;#39;s in the Overton Window</text>
  <text start="533.79" dur="4.16">it&amp;#39;s just perfectly normal conversation</text>
  <text start="536.16" dur="5.67">at this point unless you&amp;#39;re a liberal</text>
  <text start="537.95" dur="5.86">and now the next thing I like to talk</text>
  <text start="541.83" dur="4.44">about this often and you&amp;#39;re seeing it</text>
  <text start="543.81" dur="4.92">like I just reported now he uses the</text>
  <text start="546.27" dur="5.61">word treason a lot now it&amp;#39;s in regard to</text>
  <text start="548.73" dur="6.18">Obama he keeps incrementally escalating</text>
  <text start="551.88" dur="5.579">this dude is a genius I can&amp;#39;t tell you</text>
  <text start="554.91" dur="3.48">how much I have and you guys all have it</text>
  <text start="557.459" dur="3.691">too we all</text>
  <text start="558.39" dur="4.38">respect President Trump but to have to</text>
  <text start="561.15" dur="3.27">followed exactly what he&amp;#39;s doing so</text>
  <text start="562.77" dur="4.5">closely to follow the queue and on</text>
  <text start="564.42" dur="4.89">movements so closely like full-time for</text>
  <text start="567.27" dur="4.68">years now since he was elected but</text>
  <text start="569.31" dur="4.47">definitely since late 2017 when I</text>
  <text start="571.95" dur="6.09">started my youtube channel Christmas Eve</text>
  <text start="573.78" dur="7.08">that one was banned I have so much</text>
  <text start="578.04" dur="5.58">respect for this guy so much respect for</text>
  <text start="580.86" dur="5.52">this man for this hero president Donald</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="4.32">Trump for his mind for his ability to</text>
  <text start="586.38" dur="3.57">put up with all of this stuff and for</text>
  <text start="587.94" dur="4.47">his ability to get it done I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="589.95" dur="4.92">always impressed so General Michael</text>
  <text start="592.41" dur="6.09">Flynn lawyers claimed that the FBI boss</text>

  <text start="751.19" dur="3.45">remember the exact quote I think he said</text>
  <text start="753.38" dur="2.82">it&amp;#39;s all we all know it&amp;#39;s more than two</text>
  <text start="754.64" dur="4.77">times or something like that but yeah</text>
  <text start="756.2" dur="6.93">absolutely it&amp;#39;s not like Joe just broke</text>
  <text start="759.41" dur="6.63">the rules choice anyway confirmed Sidney</text>
  <text start="763.13" dur="6.15">Powell&amp;#39;s admits to having a high level</text>
  <text start="766.04" dur="4.95">trusted source within the DOJ itself so</text>
  <text start="769.28" dur="4.56">Sidney Powell of course would probably</text>
  <text start="770.99" dur="4.29">have that I believe it and she certainly</text>
  <text start="773.84" dur="3.3">has a good lead on some of the</text>
  <text start="775.28" dur="3.45">information that&amp;#39;s happening and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="777.14" dur="6.21">you know she&amp;#39;s a powerhouse she&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="778.73" dur="6.21">iconic figure in in the law I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="783.35" dur="4.41">of her before I even started following</text>
  <text start="784.94" dur="5.04">all of this stuff so she&amp;#39;s a big name</text>
  <text start="787.76" dur="3.78">and she&amp;#39;s it seems to be the right</text>
  <text start="789.98" dur="4.29">person for the job she&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="791.54" dur="6.48">doing better than his last attorneys so</text>
  <text start="794.27" dur="6.36">we also have breaking FBI Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="798.02" dur="6.06">suddenly drops his wrongful termination</text>
  <text start="800.63" dur="5.31">case against the DOJ so remember he was</text>
  <text start="804.08" dur="5.22">very ballsy about it he came out like he</text>
  <text start="805.94" dur="5.64">was this righteously indignant know if</text>
  <text start="809.3" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s a word he indicated I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="811.58" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s a word he had a lot of righteous</text>
  <text start="813.17" dur="4.74">indignation and he was gonna stand up to</text>
  <text start="816.08" dur="4.86">this bully Trump and he was gonna sue</text>
  <text start="817.91" dur="5.43">them for wrongfully firing him and it</text>
  <text start="820.94" dur="4.86">just got ridiculous and even put out</text>
  <text start="823.34" dur="3.08">that ridiculous book that did not do</text>
  <text start="825.8" dur="1.67">very well</text>
  <text start="826.42" dur="4.109">prior to the queue and on book by the</text>
  <text start="827.47" dur="6.35">way we we blasted past him anyway so</text>
  <text start="830.529" dur="7.081">I&amp;#39;ve just don&amp;#39;t like this guy that much</text>
  <text start="833.82" dur="7.87">he&amp;#39;s one of the he&amp;#39;s one of the key pens</text>
  <text start="837.61" dur="6.96">to this though the Keystone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="841.69" dur="4.829">because he not only did he say he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="844.57" dur="4.319">bring down the entire FBI but he&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="846.519" dur="4.981">been caught in lies and so has calming</text>
  <text start="848.889" dur="3.991">and these things eventually now that we</text>
  <text start="851.5" dur="2.76">know that they&amp;#39;re lying and we can get</text>
  <text start="852.88" dur="3.99">into the the question and answer</text>
  <text start="854.26" dur="7.199">sessions they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="856.87" dur="6.99">keep their answers coordinated and</text>
  <text start="861.459" dur="3.57">synced and even if they could there are</text>
  <text start="863.86" dur="3.36">situations where they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="865.029" dur="4.141">contradicted one another where people</text>
  <text start="867.22" dur="3.96">are gonna have to get to the bottom of</text>
  <text start="869.17" dur="3.99">it and someone&amp;#39;s going down right so</text>
  <text start="871.18" dur="3.599">there that&amp;#39;s why the queue and on</text>
  <text start="873.16" dur="3.69">movement a while back a few months now</text>
  <text start="874.779" dur="5.25">started to talk about how the rats were</text>
  <text start="876.85" dur="5.549">turning you know and in fact smart money</text>
  <text start="880.029" dur="4.74">says that Lynch has turned Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="882.399" dur="4.411">so there are big players trying to save</text>
  <text start="884.769" dur="4.26">themselves now because they see the</text>
  <text start="886.81" dur="3.06">writing on the wall and these folks are</text>
  <text start="889.029" dur="3.24">in trouble</text>
  <text start="889.87" dur="5.13">so Andy McCabe is no longer trying to</text>
  <text start="892.269" dur="5.161">get wrongful termination he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="895" dur="4.62">stay at a prison so we also have Hillary</text>
  <text start="897.43" dur="4.2">Clinton blaming and this is getting</text>
  <text start="899.62" dur="3.42">really weird guys if you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="901.63" dur="3.899">following the queue and on movement if</text>
  <text start="903.04" dur="4.979">not let me give you some context I won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="905.529" dur="4.8">show you the pictures I&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="908.019" dur="4.171">the videos I don&amp;#39;t ever want to see the</text>
  <text start="910.329" dur="4.291">videos and they would not be legal to</text>
  <text start="912.19" dur="4.829">watch however in the video called</text>
  <text start="914.62" dur="5.1">frazzle drip which appeared in the dark</text>
  <text start="917.019" dur="6.44">web and also made its way as a sort of a</text>
  <text start="919.72" dur="6.809">rumor among the entire community online</text>
  <text start="923.459" dur="4.931">frazzle drip was supposedly a video of</text>
  <text start="926.529" dur="7.141">Hillary and Hume Abbott and taking power</text>
  <text start="928.39" dur="7.379">tools to a child and whether you believe</text>
  <text start="933.67" dur="6">that or not it could have been what was</text>
  <text start="935.769" dur="6.841">on the Weinstein the Weiner laptop</text>
  <text start="939.67" dur="4.62">because we know that the police there in</text>
  <text start="942.61" dur="3.839">some cases threw up and sought</text>
  <text start="944.29" dur="5.19">counseling afterwards and it turned</text>
  <text start="946.449" dur="4.62">their stomach and then many of those</text>
  <text start="949.48" dur="6.27">police have now committed suicide</text>
  <text start="951.069" dur="7.591">supposedly and that&amp;#39;s an NYPD so this</text>
  <text start="955.75" dur="4.42">video that she brought up okay this is</text>
  <text start="958.66" dur="4.92">very strange to see her</text>
  <text start="960.17" dur="6.42">to her see her bring it up this video</text>
  <text start="963.58" dur="5.95">when it was mentioned is when you saw</text>
  <text start="966.59" dur="5.94">the trend occur the rise of the deep</text>
  <text start="969.53" dur="6.33">fakes never heard a word like deep fake</text>
  <text start="972.53" dur="6.06">before until this video started making</text>
  <text start="975.86" dur="4.98">the rumor rounds and then you started to</text>
  <text start="978.59" dur="4.2">hear the rise of the deep fake and</text>
  <text start="980.84" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s when they began to push this</text>
  <text start="982.79" dur="5.25">narrative that oh not only is the</text>
  <text start="985.1" dur="4.95">technology here and then within a few</text>
  <text start="988.04" dur="3.63">months they had even perfected it to the</text>
  <text start="990.05" dur="5.64">point where they could make fairly</text>
  <text start="991.67" dur="5.25">convincing deep fake videos and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="995.69" dur="2.94">know if you ever saw the one whisking</text>
  <text start="996.92" dur="4.29">for different Obama saying the same</text>
  <text start="998.63" dur="4.32">thing for different ways because none of</text>
  <text start="1001.21" dur="4.02">them were really him and it looked</text>
  <text start="1002.95" dur="3.72">pretty good so there is that kind of</text>
  <text start="1005.23" dur="3.63">technology out there and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1006.67" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re gonna say when these things come</text>
  <text start="1008.86" dur="4.44">out if they come out they would say oh</text>
  <text start="1010.69" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s a deep fake so I don&amp;#39;t know why</text>
  <text start="1013.3" dur="3.84">she brought it up it&amp;#39;s not the kind of</text>
  <text start="1015.49" dur="4.53">thing anyone&amp;#39;s gonna take seriously and</text>
  <text start="1017.14" dur="4.8">like accredited or academic circles</text>
  <text start="1020.02" dur="3.75">because it&amp;#39;s a rumor and no one can</text>
  <text start="1021.94" dur="6.75">prove it and it can&amp;#39;t be seen because</text>
  <text start="1023.77" dur="6.24">it&amp;#39;s illegal however and I on a side</text>
  <text start="1028.69" dur="2.82">note the school the crazy phone calls</text>
  <text start="1030.01" dur="3">that I got if you guys remember that</text>
  <text start="1031.51" dur="3.449">when I would have a hundred phone calls</text>
  <text start="1033.01" dur="3.9">per minute and there were screams on it</text>
  <text start="1034.959" dur="3.811">that supposedly I was told this later I</text>
  <text start="1036.91" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t know those screams were from that</text>
  <text start="1038.77" dur="5.34">movie and that happened within 30</text>
  <text start="1042.52" dur="4.71">minutes of me talking about suing them</text>
  <text start="1044.11" dur="6.51">for censoring us it&amp;#39;s a scary scary</text>

  <text start="1052.93" dur="8.31">web cost her the election what why would</text>
  <text start="1059.26" dur="4.65">you ever say such a thing unless you</text>
  <text start="1061.24" dur="5.31">were drunk and super scared that</text>
  <text start="1063.91" dur="4.08">something was coming out this one thing</text>
  <text start="1066.55" dur="3.36">has made me believe in that video</text>
