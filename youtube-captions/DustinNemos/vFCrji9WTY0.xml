  <text start="29.08" dur="6.49">so guys I&amp;#39;m actually in Las Vegas of all</text>
  <text start="34.07" dur="3.03">places right now so I was here for the</text>
  <text start="35.57" dur="3.629">cryptocurrency conferences you may know</text>
  <text start="37.1" dur="5.91">and I ran into my buddy Bob here and</text>
  <text start="39.199" dur="5.131">actually Bob is the master behind free</text>
  <text start="43.01" dur="2.88">OSA it&amp;#39;s actually a really cool idea and</text>
  <text start="44.33" dur="3.33">I know many of you guys don&amp;#39;t follow the</text>
  <text start="45.89" dur="4.199">cryptocurrency stuff but you know I</text>
  <text start="47.66" dur="5.52">follow freedom in all most forms and</text>
  <text start="50.089" dur="5.731">cryptocurrency is oh my gosh one of the</text>
  <text start="53.18" dur="5.25">most important technological revolutions</text>
  <text start="55.82" dur="4.259">in the modern time so Bob Mollica</text>
  <text start="58.43" dur="3.359">introduce yourself and talk about free</text>
  <text start="60.079" dur="3.3">OSA obviously you know most of my</text>
  <text start="61.789" dur="5.371">audience don&amp;#39;t know anything about</text>
  <text start="63.379" dur="5.791">Bitcoin at all but we&amp;#39;ll stay low tech</text>
  <text start="67.16" dur="4.95">yeah mostly first off let me say how</text>
  <text start="69.17" dur="5.089">much i it is benefited and been great</text>
  <text start="72.11" dur="4.5">for me then to know Dustin and</text>
  <text start="74.259" dur="5.341">experience what&amp;#39;s going on and you also</text>
  <text start="76.61" dur="5.899">in the queue and on world the mega world</text>
  <text start="79.6" dur="6.07">because there&amp;#39;s so much synergy between</text>
  <text start="82.509" dur="5.551">the five million people in code on and</text>
  <text start="85.67" dur="4.41">and the two million people in the</text>
  <text start="88.06" dur="3.91">anarcho-capitalist group that are really</text>
  <text start="90.08" dur="4.41">the people behind cryptocurrencies and</text>
  <text start="91.97" dur="5.37">the creation of decentralized</text>
  <text start="94.49" dur="5.879">technologies that are changing the world</text>
  <text start="97.34" dur="6.75">right in front of us as we speak so it</text>
  <text start="100.369" dur="6.811">is indeed a very exciting time I have</text>
  <text start="104.09" dur="7.02">been on a long road to bring my company</text>
  <text start="107.18" dur="7.229">my project brios to the market and bring</text>
  <text start="111.11" dur="6.6">it to productive live operations and at</text>
  <text start="114.409" dur="5.911">long last already next week and it is a</text>
  <text start="117.71" dur="5.81">my mind going to change the the</text>
  <text start="120.32" dur="6.06">landscape of the whole crip diverse so</text>
  <text start="123.52" dur="6.159">let me start off by saying if you were</text>
  <text start="126.38" dur="5.01">building a I want I want to build a huge</text>
  <text start="129.679" dur="5.461">flea market let&amp;#39;s go with the real world</text>
  <text start="131.39" dur="5.33">example so I go out and go out to some</text>
  <text start="135.14" dur="4.379">place out in the country and I lease</text>
  <text start="136.72" dur="4.65">200,000 square foot facility and I want</text>
  <text start="139.519" dur="5.091">to build the biggest flea market on the</text>
  <text start="141.37" dur="6.479">plan well to do that at two problems</text>
  <text start="144.61" dur="5.37">number one to get vendors to come set up</text>
  <text start="147.849" dur="6.42">booths and stands in this flea market</text>
  <text start="149.98" dur="6.42">I need customers and get customers to</text>
  <text start="154.269" dur="5.071">come thing I need vendors already there</text>
  <text start="156.4" dur="4.41">so that&amp;#39;s the challenge of setting up a</text>
  <text start="159.34" dur="4.319">brand new market that didn&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="160.81" dur="5.33">before and we sell we&amp;#39;ve solved that</text>
  <text start="163.659" dur="7.711">problem by creating an entirely new</text>
  <text start="166.14" dur="7.09">occupation which we call deep waves the</text>
  <text start="171.37" dur="6.66">best way to think of a gateway is it is</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="6.96">essentially a broker of transactions</text>
  <text start="178.03" dur="5.22">between cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="180.19" dur="8.18">and fiat currency dollars euros yen</text>
  <text start="183.25" dur="7.44">regular money and what it enables is</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="4.27">suddenly for the first time ever in</text>
  <text start="190.69" dur="5.519">history there is a single website</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="5.31">through the net do where an anything</text>
  <text start="196.209" dur="4.14">that is sold on the Internet can be</text>
  <text start="197.95" dur="4.039">purchased with cryptocurrency in our</text>
  <text start="200.349" dur="5.61">case our project users</text>
  <text start="201.989" dur="6.011">- cryptocurrency so anyone who is</text>
  <text start="205.959" dur="4.831">cryptocurrency can convert it into -</text>
  <text start="208" dur="4.62">come to our marketplace thanks guys so</text>
  <text start="210.79" dur="3.18">here we are in Vegas and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.62" dur="2.519">interrupted by because we&amp;#39;re on an</text>
  <text start="213.97" dur="3.96">iPhone when you&amp;#39;re off to buy some</text>
  <text start="215.139" dur="4.981">things so kind of you were describing</text>
  <text start="217.93" dur="4.38">free awesome and how it offers people to</text>
  <text start="220.12" dur="3.75">buy everything with a cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="222.31" dur="3.209">that&amp;#39;s kind of unique now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="4.56">something we&amp;#39;re looking for I guess it</text>
  <text start="225.519" dur="6.06">is the very first site to make the claim</text>
  <text start="228.43" dur="5.91">to be able to do so in our case it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="231.579" dur="5.31">just a claim so it again is very</text>
  <text start="234.34" dur="5.369">exciting times perhaps would be good to</text>
  <text start="236.889" dur="6.18">step back philosophically to say what is</text>
  <text start="239.709" dur="5.46">the project all about because yes being</text>
  <text start="243.069" dur="5.57">able to earn money and cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="245.169" dur="6.241">and spend it is a component of it but</text>
  <text start="248.639" dur="4.361">what you know I want to make clear so</text>
  <text start="251.41" dur="4.229">there are no misconceptions about the</text>
  <text start="253" dur="5.609">various product is we are operating the</text>
  <text start="255.639" dur="5.22">most free market place ever in history</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="5.641">that will have ruthless competition and</text>
  <text start="260.859" dur="5.731">and and bring prices down and so on but</text>
  <text start="264.25" dur="6.3">it also facilitates learning incoming</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="8.879">crypto and having the option as a I</text>
  <text start="270.55" dur="8.72">stressed the option of not paying taxes</text>
  <text start="275.469" dur="6.271">on that income we make the transactions</text>
  <text start="279.27" dur="6.579">completely private and visible to all</text>
  <text start="281.74" dur="6.57">including to Rios we are not able to say</text>
  <text start="285.849" dur="4.56">what transactions any individual member</text>
  <text start="288.31" dur="4.68">is done we include the transaction make</text>
  <text start="290.409" dur="4.951">sure it finishes correctly and then we</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="6.51">flush it out of memory and don&amp;#39;t log any</text>
  <text start="295.36" dur="7.589">of those transactions this is very much</text>
  <text start="299.5" dur="5.759">protection to krios that we are they we</text>
  <text start="302.949" dur="6.21">do not believe in no your customer or</text>
  <text start="305.259" dur="6.81">any any such regulations legislation and</text>
  <text start="309.159" dur="5.241">we take the opposite approach that we</text>
  <text start="312.069" dur="6.09">refuse to allow our members to identify</text>
  <text start="314.4" dur="6.549">themselves electronically officially to</text>
  <text start="318.159" dur="4.591">us now I have plenty of friends that are</text>
  <text start="320.949" dur="4.25">members of Rios and I know what the Rios</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="4.62">name is but as far as three OHS</text>
  <text start="325.199" dur="5.65">systematically knowing who any members</text>
  <text start="327.37" dur="5.729">are the best way to create a chain of</text>
  <text start="330.849" dur="4.731">privacy just it out of any weak links</text>
  <text start="333.099" dur="4.921">and the personal link to start with this</text>
  <text start="335.58" dur="4.57">your completely anonymous from the</text>
  <text start="338.02" dur="6.81">beginning then the technology that we</text>
  <text start="340.15" dur="7.019">use fills in the remaining pieces so</text>
  <text start="344.83" dur="6.149">that that is sort of what people would</text>
  <text start="347.169" dur="6.93">expect for a free marketplace indeed</text>
  <text start="350.979" dur="5.521">free market and I think it be valid to</text>
  <text start="354.099" dur="4.261">understand how the money works so the</text>
  <text start="356.5" dur="4.11">breather net that I of marketplace</text>
  <text start="358.36" dur="3.3">allows unlimited number of listings</text>
  <text start="360.61" dur="3.81">forever so</text>
  <text start="361.66" dur="6.26">no costs to come into the market and</text>
  <text start="364.42" dur="5.43">list your products or services when you</text>
  <text start="367.92" dur="4.35">complete a sale and you have a</text>
  <text start="369.85" dur="5.88">transaction than three us will take a 2%</text>
  <text start="372.27" dur="5.56">processing fee to complete the desk</text>
  <text start="375.73" dur="5.01">transaction with less than credit cards</text>
  <text start="377.83" dur="4.59">correct yeah at understating any regular</text>
  <text start="380.74" dur="5.73">traditional e-commerce website here</text>
  <text start="382.42" dur="7.92">these PayPal at 2.6 percent these 2.8</text>
  <text start="386.47" dur="6.51">Amex at 5.5 and all three of those have</text>
  <text start="390.34" dur="4.98">charge banks which means someone buys a</text>
  <text start="392.98" dur="4.8">product or service from you you deliver</text>
  <text start="395.32" dur="4.02">it 45 days later they get the credit</text>
  <text start="397.78" dur="3.6">card statement and they call up and say</text>
  <text start="399.34" dur="4.59">I didn&amp;#39;t order that and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="401.38" dur="4.71">the the onus is on you to prove that you</text>
  <text start="403.93" dur="3.87">in fact did deliver it and so on then</text>
  <text start="406.09" dur="3.24">you have to sort of sue your customer</text>
  <text start="407.8" dur="4.71">and raises the price for everything</text>
  <text start="409.33" dur="5.82">correct one and then breath now in our</text>
  <text start="412.51" dur="4.26">world it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s - cryptocurrency so as</text>
  <text start="415.15" dur="4.11">soon as the transaction completes</text>
  <text start="416.77" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s not a force on the planet that</text>
  <text start="419.26" dur="4.88">can take that - away from you without</text>
  <text start="421.09" dur="5.4">your consent that&amp;#39;s the very nature of</text>
  <text start="424.14" dur="4.93">crypto if you want to just a simplistic</text>
  <text start="426.49" dur="5.31">overview it is having a Swiss bank</text>
  <text start="429.07" dur="5.13">account in your pocket that you control</text>
  <text start="431.8" dur="4.68">completely as Obama put it yeah exactly</text>
  <text start="434.2" dur="6.75">exactly it is then they were afraid of</text>
  <text start="436.48" dur="9">it then and and you know the idea is the</text>
  <text start="440.95" dur="6.42">problem with our current system is we</text>
  <text start="445.48" dur="5.13">have all sorts of intermediaries that</text>
  <text start="447.37" dur="5.85">are trusted intermediaries in the</text>
  <text start="450.61" dur="5.25">traditional sense but can transact yes</text>
  <text start="453.22" dur="4.74">there they&amp;#39;re the lows of despicable</text>
  <text start="455.86" dur="5.28">people that are not worthy of trust you</text>
  <text start="457.96" dur="3.86">know and the whole bankers people yes</text>
  <text start="461.14" dur="4.41">sorry</text>
  <text start="461.82" dur="5.77">banksters make sirs but so you know I</text>
  <text start="465.55" dur="4.74">believe that crypto is is in real and</text>
  <text start="467.59" dur="4.27">present danger to the ongoing viability</text>
  <text start="470.29" dur="4.63">of made out of thin air</text>
  <text start="471.86" dur="6.09">fiat money and I think it is the</text>
  <text start="474.92" dur="5.88">healthiest thing for humanity for that</text>
  <text start="477.95" dur="4.41">conversion to happen and we&amp;#39;ve just had</text>
  <text start="480.8" dur="3.78">lunch and I was talking about you know</text>
  <text start="482.36" dur="4.86">what I you see coming is the greatest</text>
  <text start="484.58" dur="4.41">transfer of wealth in human history and</text>
  <text start="487.22" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s from the traditional central</text>
  <text start="488.99" dur="6.78">banking empires of the Rothschilds and</text>
  <text start="492.08" dur="7.11">the Pacers who run the Global Bank or</text>
  <text start="495.77" dur="5.13">the IMF the World Bank and the BIS the</text>
  <text start="499.19" dur="6.03">Bank of International Settlements in</text>
  <text start="500.9" dur="6">Basel they&amp;#39;re gonna lose their power and</text>
  <text start="505.22" dur="4.35">wealth because the money is going to be</text>
  <text start="506.9" dur="5.07">replaced by cryptocurrencies what that</text>
  <text start="509.57" dur="4.44">happens that wealth is going to be</text>
  <text start="511.97" dur="3.63">transferred to those of you who were</text>
  <text start="514.01" dur="4.29">able to see the writing on the wall and</text>
  <text start="515.6" dur="4.71">read the tea leaves and understand now</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="5.7">is the time to get into bullion and</text>
  <text start="520.31" dur="7.5">crypto right now and especially not just</text>
  <text start="524" dur="4.92">buy into crypto but if you are still</text>
  <text start="527.81" dur="3.96">working and you have an ongoing</text>
  <text start="528.92" dur="5.43">occupation that you can provide provide</text>
  <text start="531.77" dur="4.74">it for crypto and you might keep your</text>
  <text start="534.35" dur="3.69">day job for a little while but at a</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="3.3">certain point your evening income</text>
  <text start="538.04" dur="4.8">providing the same thing you do then the</text>
  <text start="539.81" dur="5.31">day for crypto has gotten to the point</text>
  <text start="542.84" dur="4.44">where you can quit your day job I think</text>
  <text start="545.12" dur="4.11">I think to add to that we have reached</text>
  <text start="547.28" dur="4.08">an interesting point now where you you</text>
  <text start="549.23" dur="4.11">know you you could actually make more</text>
  <text start="551.36" dur="3.51">money by offering things in your dough</text>
  <text start="553.34" dur="3.15">on top of your traditional business</text>
  <text start="554.87" dur="4.29">because there are people who they want</text>
  <text start="556.49" dur="3.78">to spend it do so so it&amp;#39;s an opportunity</text>
  <text start="559.16" dur="3.06">that cost them nothing</text>
  <text start="560.27" dur="4.14">yeah the worldwide stats are there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.22" dur="5.16">about 25 million people worldwide who</text>
  <text start="564.41" dur="4.92">touch to any crypto of that five million</text>
  <text start="567.38" dur="3.87">of them are you know it&amp;#39;s sort of the</text>
  <text start="569.33" dur="3.3">Hodler camp that they&amp;#39;ve just you know</text>
  <text start="571.25" dur="3.96">bought their crypto because they knew</text>
  <text start="572.63" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s going to eventually explode and</text>
  <text start="575.21" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re just sitting on it waiting you</text>
  <text start="577.19" dur="3.15">know the other 20 million people maybe</text>
  <text start="578.75" dur="4.71">their traders day traders investors</text>
  <text start="580.34" dur="4.89">speculators but there&amp;#39;s a core group</text>
  <text start="583.46" dur="3.72">that is it crypto for all the right</text>
  <text start="585.23" dur="3.24">reasons and and they&amp;#39;re going to benefit</text>
  <text start="587.18" dur="3.17">from this</text>
  <text start="588.47" dur="4.32">blouson boom that&amp;#39;s coming our way and</text>
  <text start="590.35" dur="4.75">it&amp;#39;s not necesarily cryptos are</text>
  <text start="592.79" dur="3.66">constantly improving there&amp;#39;s all sorts</text>
  <text start="595.1" dur="4.05">of the smartest kids in the world</text>
  <text start="596.45" dur="5.25">working on all these projects but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599.15" dur="5.88">really going on and why kryptos going up</text>
  <text start="601.7" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s not as much of a reflection of</text>
  <text start="605.03" dur="5.73">dramatic improvements of cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="606.74" dur="6.69">technology as de Matic and dramatic</text>
  <text start="610.76" dur="5.43">increases in skepticism and doubt about</text>
  <text start="613.43" dur="4.88">the world existing world financial</text>
  <text start="616.19" dur="5.52">system and dollar especially right</text>
  <text start="618.31" dur="5.23">especially is euro I&amp;#39;m gonna guess the</text>
  <text start="621.71" dur="4.59">euro actually fails first because the</text>
  <text start="623.54" dur="5.4">Deutsche Bank but it&amp;#39;s probably 48 hours</text>
  <text start="626.3" dur="4.44">from euro failure the dollar failure and</text>
  <text start="628.94" dur="2.94">I don&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;ll go to infinity</text>
  <text start="630.74" dur="4.32">right away I think we&amp;#39;ll have some</text>
  <text start="631.88" dur="5.31">shocks this will be sort of a birth</text>
  <text start="635.06" dur="5.28">pangs situation but I believe the birth</text>
  <text start="637.19" dur="5.43">pangs do start this October they always</text>
  <text start="640.34" dur="6.39">tend to break big news financial news</text>
  <text start="642.62" dur="6.45">like this in October and mainly you know</text>
  <text start="646.73" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s just simply a matter of physics so</text>
  <text start="649.07" dur="5.13">those of you who live through or through</text>
  <text start="651.56" dur="5.1">and we&amp;#39;re aware of the circumstances of</text>
  <text start="654.2" dur="3.57">the 2008 almost collapse of the world</text>
  <text start="656.66" dur="3.75">economic system</text>
  <text start="657.77" dur="4.74">you know when the the Treasury</text>

  <text start="895.249" dur="5.46">crypto you know the coolest thing about</text>
  <text start="897.559" dur="6.89">it is that it is peer-to-peer technology</text>

  <text start="911.959" dur="3.451">yeah they&amp;#39;re very much like an email</text>
  <text start="914.239" dur="3.361">except it&amp;#39;s not even going through a</text>

  <text start="919.85" dur="4.979">places but there&amp;#39;s no intermediate okay</text>
  <text start="922.97" dur="4.859">so there&amp;#39;s no government or intermediary</text>
  <text start="924.829" dur="5.1">there&amp;#39;s no the Biss or the Swift system</text>

  <text start="956.8" dur="4.65">better site in my book and then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="959.65" dur="4.32">an even newer one called Robin Hood</text>

  <text start="1187.82" dur="5.94">they when they do pay them they pay them</text>
  <text start="1190.1" dur="7.2">in Amazon cash which is only worth</text>
  <text start="1193.76" dur="5.34">anything at Amazon so it&amp;#39;s not rupees as</text>
  <text start="1197.3" dur="4.11">India money and it&amp;#39;s not dollars and</text>
  <text start="1199.1" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s definitely not crypto so these guys</text>
  <text start="1201.41" dur="4.26">are sitting on a whole bunch Amazon cash</text>
  <text start="1203.39" dur="4.35">that they can spend at Amazon but these</text>
  <text start="1205.67" dur="3.93">are poor people in India they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1207.74" dur="5.13">you know more televisions they want</text>
  <text start="1209.6" dur="5.49">quick good currency so cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="1212.87" dur="4.95">guys have discovered you can go to these</text>
  <text start="1215.09" dur="5.07">guys holding Amazon cash and buy it from</text>
  <text start="1217.82" dur="5.31">them for 75 cents on the dollar</text>
  <text start="1220.16" dur="5.55">ok and then I could go spend it at a</text>
  <text start="1223.13" dur="5.04">dollar for the dollar so what happens is</text>
  <text start="1225.71" dur="6.3">you go to Amazon and say here&amp;#39;s the TV</text>
  <text start="1228.17" dur="6.21">my gateway it goes and get spice that</text>
  <text start="1232.01" dur="5.64">much Amazon cash the exact dollar amount</text>
  <text start="1234.38" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s owed at 75% off so the gateway</text>
  <text start="1237.65" dur="5.13">art automatically has 25 points in this</text>
  <text start="1239.81" dur="6.57">transaction that he could give 15 to you</text>
  <text start="1242.78" dur="6.06">ok so I my price is now and it was on -</text>
  <text start="1246.38" dur="4.08">15 % and the Gateway still makes a</text>

  <text start="1297.17" dur="4.74">are many services are going to pop up</text>
  <text start="1298.91" dur="4.62">because these crypto rich people most of</text>
  <text start="1301.91" dur="5.97">them might have and know lots of them</text>
  <text start="1303.53" dur="7.35">have led very frugal lives they they put</text>

  <text start="1310.88" dur="4.2">could put every spare cent they had into</text>
  <text start="1313.1" dur="4.17">buying cryptical and holding onto it and</text>
  <text start="1315.08" dur="3.54">suddenly for the first time they like</text>
  <text start="1317.27" dur="3.78">most of these people have never had a</text>
  <text start="1318.62" dur="5.07">thousand dollars in their hand before</text>
  <text start="1321.05" dur="5.19">and in a couple of months they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1323.69" dur="4.47">to have $200,000 worth of crypto and</text>
  <text start="1326.24" dur="4.41">then they don&amp;#39;t want to again turn it</text>
  <text start="1328.16" dur="4.53">back into dollars to pay taxes on it but</text>
  <text start="1330.65" dur="3.45">they do want to spend it and so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1332.69" dur="4.26">an opportunity to create whole new</text>
  <text start="1334.1" dur="4.68">classes of services that are cooler than</text>
  <text start="1336.95" dur="4.14">what&amp;#39;s out there in the real world and</text>
  <text start="1338.78" dur="4.92">so I really encourage any entrepreneur</text>
  <text start="1341.09" dur="4.26">to say anyone can come to our market say</text>
  <text start="1343.7" dur="3.6">I solve a problem better than someone</text>
  <text start="1345.35" dur="5.07">else has and we want it to be a</text>

  <text start="1350.42" dur="4.95">marketing innovation and excellence it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1353.03" dur="3.72">for the benefit of our members you know</text>
  <text start="1355.37" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re also the people that are sewing</text>
  <text start="1356.75" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s a different market so I&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="1359" dur="5.07">to cover one other thing which is where</text>
  <text start="1361.4" dur="4.26">we really cover the loop and that is so</text>
  <text start="1364.07" dur="4.28">that gets me everything on the internet</text>
  <text start="1365.66" dur="6.03">and everything financial attractions</text>
  <text start="1368.35" dur="5.38">transactions so for example you may be</text>
  <text start="1371.69" dur="6.12">familiar with some of you probably pay</text>
  <text start="1373.73" dur="5.85">your bills online rather than using you</text>
  <text start="1377.81" dur="4.11">know writing checks out putting them in</text>
  <text start="1379.58" dur="4.35">envelopes and putting stamps on them and</text>
  <text start="1381.92" dur="5.09">what you use then is something called an</text>
  <text start="1383.93" dur="5.61">ACH automatic Clearing House transaction</text>
  <text start="1387.01" dur="4.42">which is similar to a wire but it cost</text>
  <text start="1389.54" dur="5.52">that cost 30 bucks it&amp;#39;s cheaper it</text>
  <text start="1391.43" dur="4.83">happens faster and it&amp;#39;s the way all the</text>
  <text start="1395.06" dur="3.09">utilities are so</text>
  <text start="1396.26" dur="5.549">so we find a company that&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="1398.15" dur="5.25">doing that paying ACH for your utility</text>
  <text start="1401.809" dur="7.74">bills so you just say yours electric</text>
  <text start="1403.4" dur="7.8">cast and telephone and but the the</text>
  <text start="1409.549" dur="4.291">Gateway is gonna be in the middle of</text>
  <text start="1411.2" dur="4.68">that transaction and say okay so now you</text>
  <text start="1413.84" dur="4.32">could pay a - I&amp;#39;ll convert that into</text>
  <text start="1415.88" dur="3.69">dollars to pay all your bills so it was</text>
  <text start="1418.16" dur="3.3">one of the final things that people said</text>
  <text start="1419.57" dur="4.56">why can&amp;#39;t pay my rent I can&amp;#39;t pay my</text>
  <text start="1421.46" dur="4.26">mortgage yes you can no it&amp;#39;s just you</text>
  <text start="1424.13" dur="4.799">know someone else converts it into Fiat</text>
  <text start="1425.72" dur="5.37">and pays it for you and it&amp;#39;s all done so</text>
  <text start="1428.929" dur="5.071">the next frontier the final frontier is</text>
  <text start="1431.09" dur="4.68">the real world and we&amp;#39;ve come up with a</text>
  <text start="1434" dur="5.34">program for that we call it the real</text>
  <text start="1435.77" dur="5.88">world offers program that I will be able</text>
  <text start="1439.34" dur="5.16">to go I lived out in pliable feel</text>
  <text start="1441.65" dur="4.38">Acapulco Mexico and I&amp;#39;ve already been</text>
  <text start="1444.5" dur="3.419">making friends with the owners so all</text>
  <text start="1446.03" dur="5.49">these bars and restaurants they&amp;#39;re right</text>
  <text start="1447.919" dur="6.091">on the water and basically pre-sold them</text>
  <text start="1451.52" dur="5.159">on this super model that I&amp;#39;ll walk into</text>
  <text start="1454.01" dur="4.56">the restaurant in our marketplace you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1456.679" dur="4.051">allowed five pictures and a thousand</text>
  <text start="1458.57" dur="4.41">characters of text that&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1460.73" dur="4.14">what a listing is so I&amp;#39;ll take a picture</text>
  <text start="1462.98" dur="4.68">of the front of the restaurant the three</text>
  <text start="1464.87" dur="4.89">pages of the menu and the owner and get</text>
  <text start="1467.66" dur="4.56">the listing the offer all set up and</text>
  <text start="1469.76" dur="4.919">then I previously have created an</text>
  <text start="1472.22" dur="4.56">account before it not submitted it the</text>
  <text start="1474.679" dur="5.281">offers not posted until the owner says</text>
  <text start="1476.78" dur="4.95">yes but I created a QR code you may be</text>
  <text start="1479.96" dur="3.36">familiar with the little square things</text>
  <text start="1481.73" dur="3.8">that you can point your phone at and it</text>
  <text start="1483.32" dur="4.65">will translate that number by</text>
  <text start="1485.53" dur="4.72">recognizing it in that little square QR</text>
  <text start="1487.97" dur="4.62">code well so what will happen is the bar</text>
  <text start="1490.25" dur="3.87">will get one or two of those laminated</text>
  <text start="1492.59" dur="4.35">you know on a piece of cardboard and</text>
  <text start="1494.12" dur="4.29">then they go into the prios marketplace</text>
  <text start="1496.94" dur="4.38">and everybody in the world now knows</text>
  <text start="1498.41" dur="8.37">that I can spend - for dinner at this</text>
  <text start="1501.32" dur="8.13">this steak house and instantly they will</text>
  <text start="1506.78" dur="3.99">get access to a whole bunch of customers</text>
  <text start="1509.45" dur="4.14">they never would have been able to work</text>
  <text start="1510.77" dur="4.92">- otherwise just people in the</text>
  <text start="1513.59" dur="3.94">cryptocurrency generally don&amp;#39;t do stuff</text>
  <text start="1515.69" dur="4.96">like watch television or</text>
  <text start="1517.53" dur="6.48">you know paid much attention to to push</text>
  <text start="1520.65" dur="6.45">marketing and and there&amp;#39;s no cost to</text>
  <text start="1524.01" dur="4.77">adding credos to your bill unless</text>
  <text start="1527.1" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s a transaction and once again</text>
  <text start="1528.78" dur="4.65">most restaurants are taking Visa</text>
  <text start="1530.97" dur="5.31">MasterCard our transaction fee slower</text>
  <text start="1533.43" dur="4.53">there&amp;#39;s no charge backs and it&amp;#39;s cashing</text>
  <text start="1536.28" dur="4.41">in many ways it&amp;#39;s actually better than</text>
  <text start="1537.96" dur="5.19">cash because most restaurant owners will</text>
  <text start="1540.69" dur="5.07">if they&amp;#39;re honest with themselves admit</text>
  <text start="1543.15" dur="4.62">that even their the the long-term stable</text>
  <text start="1545.76" dur="4.32">loyal employees probably pocketed a</text>
  <text start="1547.77" dur="4.35">little bit out of the till everyone when</text>
  <text start="1550.08" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s a - bill the bill goes up early</text>
  <text start="1552.12" dur="5.4">customer he scans the QR code since the</text>
  <text start="1555.66" dur="3.9">- and it goes from his phone to the met</text>
  <text start="1557.52" dur="2.64">to the owners phone and no one else is</text>
  <text start="1559.56" dur="3.86">the wiser</text>
  <text start="1560.16" dur="6.87">so no pilfering of cash out of the till</text>
  <text start="1563.42" dur="5.35">no reporting that you know Visa</text>
  <text start="1567.03" dur="3.63">MasterCard or certainly reporting</text>
  <text start="1568.77" dur="3.78">transactions to the IRS where you have</text>
  <text start="1570.66" dur="4.59">done that the transaction didn&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="1572.55" dur="6.89">so it&amp;#39;s another thing that we feel like</text>
  <text start="1575.25" dur="6.54">we&amp;#39;re in a position to deliver faster on</text>
  <text start="1579.44" dur="4.42">bringing cryptocurrency to the real</text>
  <text start="1581.79" dur="3.45">world where normal restaurants on the</text>
  <text start="1583.86" dur="3.45">street you don&amp;#39;t have to do any kind of</text>
  <text start="1585.24" dur="4.38">a conversion you can go directly in</text>
  <text start="1587.31" dur="5.04">instead - and that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1589.62" dur="6.03">going to be exciting so the last little</text>
  <text start="1592.35" dur="6.99">bit I know we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re going to try not</text>
  <text start="1595.65" dur="5.46">to get it at any technology on hooked on</text>
  <text start="1599.34" dur="4.08">how it works but I want to make the</text>
  <text start="1601.11" dur="5.82">clear point that this technology was</text>
  <text start="1603.42" dur="5.58">designed specifically to thwart any</text>
  <text start="1606.93" dur="5.25">attempts by censorship by any</text>
  <text start="1609" dur="5.91">governments on the planet and what you</text>
  <text start="1612.18" dur="5.52">notice when you&amp;#39;ll see I&amp;#39;m not sure who</text>
  <text start="1614.91" dur="4.95">then who the Democratic congressman and</text>
  <text start="1617.7" dur="4.95">first will say we can&amp;#39;t a lot Bitcoin to</text>
  <text start="1619.86" dur="5.88">happen we won&amp;#39;t be able to tax it well</text>
  <text start="1622.65" dur="4.51">yeah of course but then recently Maxine</text>
  <text start="1625.74" dur="4.72">Waters has been coming</text>
  <text start="1627.16" dur="6.21">and every time some politician tries to</text>
  <text start="1630.46" dur="5.36">say we&amp;#39;re gonna stop Bitcoin it has the</text>
  <text start="1633.37" dur="5.73">exact opposite effect that it causes</text>
  <text start="1635.82" dur="5.65">another million people to find out oh no</text>
  <text start="1639.1" dur="5.01">Bitcoin was designed so they can&amp;#39;t stop</text>
  <text start="1641.47" dur="4.74">it and they become enthusiasts and in</text>
  <text start="1644.11" dur="5.309">the market so the point that I want you</text>
  <text start="1646.21" dur="7.62">to understand is they spent five years</text>
  <text start="1649.419" dur="6.951">from from the publishing of the Satoshi</text>
  <text start="1653.83" dur="5.07">white paper they spent five years</text>
  <text start="1656.37" dur="3.91">thinking there was some way to stop it</text>
  <text start="1658.9" dur="5.1">that they could put the toothpaste back</text>
  <text start="1660.28" dur="6.21">in the tube that war is over we win</text>
  <text start="1664" dur="6.24">there is no stopping Bitcoin what we had</text>
  <text start="1666.49" dur="5.79">to do was create edible competition to</text>
  <text start="1670.24" dur="4.2">the monopoly fiat money is all coming</text>
  <text start="1672.28" dur="4.35">out of Switzerland and we have it now</text>
  <text start="1674.44" dur="4.95">and it can&amp;#39;t be stopped so in many ways</text>
  <text start="1676.63" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;ve already won this war all that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1679.39" dur="3.419">down to is that you know we still have</text>
  <text start="1681.13" dur="3.96">to go through the skirmishes of battles</text>
  <text start="1682.809" dur="4.051">but we already know the outcome and in</text>
  <text start="1685.09" dur="4.29">terms of scrip those are gonna win and</text>
  <text start="1686.86" dur="4.38">right right my stuff yeah yeah there are</text>
  <text start="1689.38" dur="3.6">a couple hundred Kryptos and only twenty</text>
  <text start="1691.24" dur="3.72">ten or twenty will ever survive so the</text>
  <text start="1692.98" dur="5.069">blockchain itself has changed the world</text>
  <text start="1694.96" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s not going back dude so and this has</text>
  <text start="1698.049" dur="3.541">been cheek stuffed with blockchain</text>
  <text start="1699.4" dur="4.05">technology completely separable crypto</text>
  <text start="1701.59" dur="4.38">and having nothing to do with especially</text>
  <text start="1703.45" dur="5.07">any of the sordid aspects of crispo</text>
  <text start="1705.97" dur="5.01">crypto like the dark web and stuff like</text>
  <text start="1708.52" dur="4.019">that which is by the way there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="1710.98" dur="4.079">to do with the crypto specifically it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1712.539" dur="5.76">convenient form of of potentially</text>
  <text start="1715.059" dur="5.881">anonymous marketing such what so is cash</text>
  <text start="1718.299" dur="4.321">you know used otherwise the old way was</text>
  <text start="1720.94" dur="3.93">to just send cash through like back</text>
  <text start="1722.62" dur="6.48">channels or or in a plane the way Obama</text>
  <text start="1724.87" dur="6.09">delivered large pallets of cash but in</text>
  <text start="1729.1" dur="2.97">the new way it&amp;#39;s just crypto so a bit</text>
  <text start="1730.96" dur="3.39">more convenient that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="1732.07" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s more criminal which is what they</text>
  <text start="1734.35" dur="3.93">like to call it you know it&amp;#39;s not more</text>
  <text start="1736.36" dur="3.42">disposed toward like drug dealers and</text>
  <text start="1738.28" dur="3.389">all this other stuff it&amp;#39;s just a better</text>
  <text start="1739.78" dur="4.56">form of money it&amp;#39;s like using cell</text>
  <text start="1741.669" dur="3.811">phones instead of the old dial-up just</text>
  <text start="1744.34" dur="2.819">because they use cell phones now the</text>
  <text start="1745.48" dur="3.87">drug dealers have the nicer cell phones</text>
  <text start="1747.159" dur="5.281">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that cell phones are like</text>
  <text start="1749.35" dur="6.51">some sort of cause of drug issues this</text>
  <text start="1752.44" dur="5.15">is sort of blaming that the technology</text>
  <text start="1755.86" dur="4.74">instead of the criminal in that case</text>
  <text start="1757.59" dur="6.82">some of you may have heard the name Ross</text>
  <text start="1760.6" dur="6.21">Ulbricht and and and I hope we continue</text>
  <text start="1764.41" dur="5.22">to raise awareness of this case that</text>
  <text start="1766.81" dur="3.81">Ross was a guy that wrote a marketplace</text>
  <text start="1769.63" dur="3.09">much like mine</text>
  <text start="1770.62" dur="4.17">okay he wrote a piece of software that</text>
  <text start="1772.72" dur="3.9">allowed people to by itself plants that</text>
  <text start="1774.79" dur="6.54">they choose to put into their own bodies</text>
  <text start="1776.62" dur="7.44">and this is the so-called dark dark web</text>
  <text start="1781.33" dur="6.42">and I will fully admit he was sowing pot</text>
  <text start="1784.06" dur="5.85">and cocaine or he wasn&amp;#39;t but people</text>
  <text start="1787.75" dur="4.76">using that marketplace were selling pot</text>
  <text start="1789.91" dur="5.64">containing more cryptocurrency and</text>
  <text start="1792.51" dur="5.65">anyway they wanted to make sort of a</text>
  <text start="1795.55" dur="5.79">making a Leona Helmsley example and Ross</text>
  <text start="1798.16" dur="4.98">and the government spent millions of</text>
  <text start="1801.34" dur="5.22">dollars in this whole sting operation</text>
  <text start="1803.14" dur="6.63">first just to catch them catch him they</text>
  <text start="1806.56" dur="5.46">completely salted the jury pool by a</text>
  <text start="1809.77" dur="5.49">bunch of outright lies and then</text>
  <text start="1812.02" dur="5.91">convicted him for two life sentences so</text>
  <text start="1815.26" dur="5.25">El Chapo who&amp;#39;s murdered hundreds of</text>
  <text start="1817.93" dur="5.22">people in an international drug drug</text>
  <text start="1820.51" dur="5.07">dealing you know mega-monster yeah I</text>
  <text start="1823.15" dur="4.71">just got one life sentence plus 30 years</text>
  <text start="1825.58" dur="5.01">so this kid who wrote computer software</text>
  <text start="1827.86" dur="5.22">is in jail for longer and at this point</text>

  <text start="1833.08" dur="5.85">be parked by our fearless leader and so</text>
  <text start="1837.01" dur="4.47">I&amp;#39;m hoping that we can continue to raise</text>
  <text start="1838.93" dur="4.38">awareness as subject because I&amp;#39;m in sort</text>

  <text start="1843.31" dur="5.4">the pure plumbing model that means we</text>
  <text start="1845.98" dur="4.74">are not going to censor or edit I&amp;#39;m not</text>

  <text start="1856.93" dur="5.64">people to sell plants and so on</text>
  <text start="1860.35" dur="4.83">the analogy that I would like to leave</text>
  <text start="1862.57" dur="5.43">with you on the subject is prior to the</text>
  <text start="1865.18" dur="5.01">internet if someone wanted to hire a</text>
  <text start="1868" dur="5.4">hitman someone wanted you know murder</text>
  <text start="1870.19" dur="5.07">for hire or they wanted you know child</text>

  <text start="1875.26" dur="4.41">disgusting things that are currently</text>
  <text start="1877.6" dur="5.28">available on the dark web how did they</text>
  <text start="1879.67" dur="5.43">do it well they picked up the phone now</text>
  <text start="1882.88" dur="4.97">should Alexander Graham Bell be going to</text>
  <text start="1885.1" dur="5.7">jail because he&amp;#39;s facilitating chronic</text>

  <text start="1893.44" dur="4.65">violent attack no one would ever think</text>
  <text start="1895.96" dur="4.44">that but somehow on the internet if you</text>
  <text start="1898.09" dur="4.11">say I have a plumbing that allows</text>
  <text start="1900.4" dur="3.72">transactions to occur that I&amp;#39;m so how</text>
  <text start="1902.2" dur="4.2">responsible for all those transactions</text>
  <text start="1904.12" dur="4.02">so I&amp;#39;d like you to hopefully hope you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1906.4" dur="4.11">remember the name free Ross and if you</text>
  <text start="1908.14" dur="3.69">see a petition going around it now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1910.51" dur="5.34">about two hundred thousand signatures</text>
  <text start="1911.83" dur="7.53">and you know what we&amp;#39;re hoping is we get</text>
  <text start="1915.85" dur="5.34">that over a million and Donald J Trump</text>
  <text start="1919.36" dur="4.41">will see those petitions and do the</text>
  <text start="1921.19" dur="4.26">right thing I actually do think that if</text>
  <text start="1923.77" dur="3.21">this were to happen a lot of</text>
  <text start="1925.45" dur="3.42">libertarians will swing their vote to</text>
  <text start="1926.98" dur="4.92">Trump because this is a popular issue</text>
  <text start="1928.87" dur="4.35">with the freedom crowd on the Internet</text>
  <text start="1931.9" dur="2.58">you know this is sort of the niche crowd</text>
  <text start="1933.22" dur="3.06">that are in the kryptos and the</text>
  <text start="1934.48" dur="3.48">technology and coding and things of that</text>
  <text start="1936.28" dur="4.89">nature it&amp;#39;s not a look you know a</text>
  <text start="1937.96" dur="6.36">million strong crowd sometimes but it is</text>
  <text start="1941.17" dur="4.5">a crowd that that has a lot of folks in</text>
  <text start="1944.32" dur="2.94">it so I think that would actually be a</text>
  <text start="1945.67" dur="3.63">pretty instant thing to see</text>
  <text start="1947.26" dur="3.42">pardon and then maybe bring a lot of</text>
  <text start="1949.3" dur="4.38">voters from the libertarian party to</text>
  <text start="1950.68" dur="4.77">Trump but I remember hearing about the</text>
  <text start="1953.68" dur="3.69">case I remember the corruption involved</text>
  <text start="1955.45" dur="5.01">I remember how they railroaded the poor</text>
  <text start="1957.37" dur="6.99">guy and I met his mom I and she&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="1960.46" dur="5.46">out there fighting tirelessly yeah you</text>
  <text start="1964.36" dur="3.4">know we definitely want to have her on</text>
  <text start="1965.92" dur="4.54">the show at some point</text>
  <text start="1967.76" dur="4.409">get more of the story yeah and you know</text>
  <text start="1970.46" dur="6.24">the greatest thing about this is the</text>
  <text start="1972.169" dur="7.86">synergy between the the mega Q 5 million</text>
