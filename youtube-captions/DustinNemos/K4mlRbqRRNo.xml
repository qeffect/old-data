  <text start="237.56" dur="4.98">here in the Capitol that Senator</text>

  <text start="257.12" dur="6.48">of legislation in The Whistleblower area</text>
  <text start="259.79" dur="7.08">and they really go hand in hand it is so</text>
  <text start="263.6" dur="4.86">important for us as IGS to have all of</text>
  <text start="266.87" dur="4.1">you be willing to come forward and</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="6.41">report to us on waste abuse misconduct</text>
  <text start="270.97" dur="6.25">mismanagement what you see in</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="5.83">organizations that you&amp;#39;ve worked with</text>
  <text start="277.22" dur="5.55">and worked for whether they are within</text>
  <text start="280.7" dur="5.12">the agency with contractors with grant</text>
  <text start="282.77" dur="7.83">recipients I often speak about this with</text>
  <text start="285.82" dur="6.97">the folks in my office we we oversee in</text>
  <text start="290.6" dur="6.87">the Justice Department over 100,000</text>
  <text start="292.79" dur="9.09">employees we have one of the largest IG</text>

  <text start="303.979" dur="2.821">doesn&amp;#39;t even touch grant recipients and</text>
  <text start="306.35" dur="2.189">confer</text>
  <text start="306.8" dur="4.44">actors gives you a sense of</text>
  <text start="308.539" dur="6.66">responsibility that can be overwhelming</text>
  <text start="311.24" dur="6.57">at times for us to do that job most</text>
  <text start="315.199" dur="5.46">effectively we need the employees of the</text>
  <text start="317.81" dur="5.729">Justice Department be willing to come in</text>
  <text start="320.659" dur="5.211">and speak to us we need employees of</text>

  <text start="328.58" dur="2.88">speak with us</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="4.649">that&amp;#39;s how oversight gets done</text>
  <text start="331.46" dur="5.16">effectively that&amp;#39;s how waste fraud abuse</text>
  <text start="333.949" dur="4.5">mismanagement is routed out that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="336.62" dur="5.07">government is made more effective and</text>
  <text start="338.449" dur="5.821">efficient and that&amp;#39;s really what as Jane</text>
  <text start="341.69" dur="4.5">was saying you all have fought for over</text>
  <text start="344.27" dur="4.98">the years and as Senator Grassley</text>
  <text start="346.19" dur="4.83">mentioned also you&amp;#39;re not in it for the</text>
  <text start="349.25" dur="4.71">money you&amp;#39;re in it because you want to</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="4.799">see justice done you want to see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="3.72">right done you want to see government</text>
  <text start="355.819" dur="3.331">work the right way you want to see</text>
  <text start="357.68" dur="3.539">government work defectively you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="359.15" dur="4.5">want to see people cheating and stealing</text>
  <text start="361.219" dur="4.861">and lying their way with the taxpayers</text>
  <text start="363.65" dur="4.229">money and that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s all about and</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s what I G&amp;#39;s work for and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.879" dur="5.491">why it&amp;#39;s so important that we work on</text>
  <text start="371.15" dur="4.98">these issues and further these issues</text>
  <text start="373.37" dur="5.13">and it&amp;#39;s one of the things that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="376.13" dur="4.379">been proud to see in the IG community</text>
  <text start="378.5" dur="5.61">over the last several years as we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="380.509" dur="6.03">worked forward to advance issues of</text>
  <text start="384.11" dur="4.41">importance on whistleblowers and</text>
  <text start="386.539" dur="4.021">whistleblowing we&amp;#39;ve worked closely with</text>
  <text start="388.52" dur="4.019">Senator Grassley staffs we work closely</text>
  <text start="390.56" dur="3.81">with the house and the Senate</text>
  <text start="392.539" dur="3.99">whistleblower caucuses we work closely</text>
  <text start="394.37" dur="4.74">with organizations like the national</text>
  <text start="396.529" dur="5.19">whistleblower Center NGOs throughout the</text>
  <text start="399.11" dur="5.369">government have heard their voices and</text>
  <text start="401.719" dur="5.04">your voices speak to us on issues that</text>
  <text start="404.479" dur="4.351">are important that issues that we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="406.759" dur="5.97">to work for that issues that make sure</text>
  <text start="408.83" dur="5.67">that the people like you all who perform</text>
  <text start="412.729" dur="4.74">such a vital and important public</text>
  <text start="414.5" dur="5.31">service coming forward speaking the</text>
  <text start="417.469" dur="4.35">truth speaking about what needs to</text>
  <text start="419.81" dur="5.13">change and making sure that you all</text>
  <text start="421.819" dur="4.65">never get retaliated for doing so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.94" dur="4.83">often easier said than done</text>
  <text start="426.469" dur="5.67">as Jane was talking about and I know</text>
  <text start="429.77" dur="4.619">from my career as a prosecutor when I</text>
  <text start="432.139" dur="3.601">was in New York City and I&amp;#39;ve familiar</text>
  <text start="434.389" dur="5.761">with some of the cases that you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="435.74" dur="6.91">referenced the folks from New York here</text>
  <text start="440.15" dur="5.59">we did a lot of police corruption work</text>
  <text start="442.65" dur="4.53">in New York City and again at the</text>
  <text start="445.74" dur="4.68">Justice Department we oversee law</text>
  <text start="447.18" dur="5.94">enforcement agencies and it takes</text>
  <text start="450.42" dur="5.55">courage for anybody to come forward in</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="4.41">any organization but I have to say it</text>
  <text start="455.97" dur="4.23">takes tremendous courage and a</text>
  <text start="457.53" dur="5.13">law-enforcement organization for people</text>
  <text start="460.2" dur="7.28">to come forward and speak truth to power</text>
  <text start="462.66" dur="7.71">and tell what&amp;#39;s really going on and</text>
  <text start="467.48" dur="6.25">oftentimes it is the only way we learn</text>
  <text start="470.37" dur="6.27">about what&amp;#39;s going on in an organization</text>
  <text start="473.73" dur="6.6">it&amp;#39;s because of people&amp;#39;s willingness to</text>
  <text start="476.64" dur="5.46">come forward and so the couple of things</text>
  <text start="480.33" dur="4.92">I want to mention that we are moving</text>
  <text start="482.1" dur="5.07">forward on in the IG community and give</text>
  <text start="485.25" dur="5.13">you a sense of what we&amp;#39;re working on and</text>
