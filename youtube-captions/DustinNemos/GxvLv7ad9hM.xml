  <text start="17.279" dur="3.84">the educators and he is currently</text>
  <text start="19.08" dur="3.9">working on another education book so</text>
  <text start="21.119" dur="3.301">actually Alex why don&amp;#39;t we start there</text>
  <text start="22.98" dur="3.889">and what&amp;#39;s the next book you&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="24.42" dur="4.529">on I know it&amp;#39;s kind of of that theme</text>
  <text start="26.869" dur="3.971">well thank you very much for having me</text>

  <text start="34.079" dur="5.16">pleasure to be with you and the the next</text>
  <text start="36.6" dur="5.13">book that we&amp;#39;re working on we have a</text>
  <text start="39.239" dur="5.191">very specific goal in mind I&amp;#39;m working</text>
  <text start="41.73" dur="4.38">with a team of really awesome people who</text>
  <text start="44.43" dur="4.469">are in the education field</text>
  <text start="46.11" dur="6.949">my colleague dr. Duke testa Israel Wayne</text>
  <text start="48.899" dur="6.271">you read more the founder of frontline</text>
  <text start="53.059" dur="3.941">ministries which is dedicated to getting</text>
  <text start="55.17" dur="5.549">kids out of government schools and so</text>
  <text start="57" dur="5.399">the the idea here is we want to show</text>
  <text start="60.719" dur="3.541">parents what&amp;#39;s actually happening in the</text>
  <text start="62.399" dur="4.621">government schools the kids are being</text>
  <text start="64.26" dur="3.899">dumbed down deliberately the kids are</text>
  <text start="67.02" dur="3.81">being turned into illiterates</text>
  <text start="68.159" dur="5.011">deliberately under Common Core they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="70.83" dur="4.59">being taught a phony version of history</text>
  <text start="73.17" dur="3.809">they&amp;#39;re being taught ridiculous ways to</text>
  <text start="75.42" dur="4.019">do math that essentially will make them</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="5.221">you know numerically illiterate if you</text>
  <text start="79.439" dur="4.771">will they&amp;#39;re being indoctrinated into</text>
  <text start="82.2" dur="4.349">socialists and communists and atheists</text>
  <text start="84.21" dur="6.24">and humanists and and all these other</text>
  <text start="86.549" dur="6.691">isms right and so our goal here is to</text>
  <text start="90.45" dur="5.4">wake parents up to wake grandparents up</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="4.32">to the need to pull your children out</text>
  <text start="95.85" dur="4.199">and what we&amp;#39;re hoping and you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="97.56" dur="5.25">kind of a big plan but what we&amp;#39;re hoping</text>
  <text start="100.049" dur="4.291">is that enough parents will get this</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="2.79">message we don&amp;#39;t need all parents better</text>
  <text start="104.34" dur="3.63">than enough parents will get this</text>
  <text start="105.6" dur="3.69">message that it&amp;#39;ll have a real impact</text>
  <text start="107.97" dur="3.57">and that will give us kind of a bigger</text>
  <text start="109.29" dur="3.509">platform you know local schools across</text>
  <text start="111.54" dur="3.09">the country let&amp;#39;s say hey wait a minute</text>
  <text start="112.799" dur="3.901">wait a minute we lost fifteen percent of</text>
  <text start="114.63" dur="3.989">our kids what&amp;#39;s going on here now we get</text>
  <text start="116.7" dur="3.36">less federal funding get the media to</text>
  <text start="118.619" dur="4.411">start asking questions and that will</text>
  <text start="120.06" dur="4.349">give us an opportunity then to to you</text>
  <text start="123.03" dur="2.67">know educate the public about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="124.409" dur="4.71">really happening with these schools</text>
  <text start="125.7" dur="5.52">because what we figured out dust and</text>
  <text start="129.119" dur="4.031">then and it took some people some time</text>
  <text start="131.22" dur="3.31">to explain this to me</text>
  <text start="133.15" dur="3.6">it was a work in progress for a while</text>
  <text start="134.53" dur="6.12">but what they finally got me to realize</text>
  <text start="136.75" dur="6.269">was that if we lose in this education</text>
  <text start="140.65" dur="3.899">battle if we continue surrendering 87%</text>
  <text start="143.019" dur="4.411">of our children to the government to be</text>
  <text start="144.549" dur="4.591">indoctrinated to be dumbed down all the</text>
  <text start="147.43" dur="3.24">other battles that we care about they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="149.14" dur="2.909">all over right we&amp;#39;re gonna lose our</text>
  <text start="150.67" dur="3.989">Liberty we&amp;#39;re gonna lose our gun rights</text>
  <text start="152.049" dur="3.81">the abortions are going to continue the</text>
  <text start="154.659" dur="2.67">you know the government is going to</text>
  <text start="155.859" dur="2.85">continue to grow the taxes are gonna</text>
  <text start="157.329" dur="4.591">keep getting higher so I don&amp;#39;t care what</text>
  <text start="158.709" dur="5.25">your issue is if 90 percent or 87</text>
  <text start="161.92" dur="3.42">percent of the children continue to be</text>
  <text start="163.959" dur="2.7">indoctrinated and dumbed down by the</text>
  <text start="165.34" dur="3.239">government we&amp;#39;re gonna lose on every</text>
  <text start="166.659" dur="5.041">other issue and so we see this as kind</text>
  <text start="168.579" dur="4.74">of the hill to die on if you will</text>
  <text start="171.7" dur="2.879">because if we lose on the education</text>
  <text start="173.319" dur="3.241">front we&amp;#39;re gonna lose on all the other</text>
  <text start="174.579" dur="3.63">fronts and so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really the</text>
  <text start="176.56" dur="4.019">goal of our book is to show parents</text>
  <text start="178.209" dur="4.381">what&amp;#39;s happening in the schools and what</text>
  <text start="180.579" dur="5.671">they need to do about it which is very</text>
  <text start="182.59" dur="7.11">simply stop giving your children over to</text>
  <text start="186.25" dur="4.98">the government to be miss educated you</text>
  <text start="189.7" dur="3.959">know obviously there&amp;#39;s a conflict of</text>
  <text start="191.23" dur="4.619">interest because governments want slaves</text>
  <text start="193.659" dur="4.83">not educated citizens that could become</text>
  <text start="195.849" dur="4.381">a threat and that just makes sense on</text>
  <text start="198.489" dur="6">every you know to any person that hears</text>
  <text start="200.23" dur="6.509">that yeah that makes sense I am NOT the</text>
  <text start="204.489" dur="3.93">most pessimistic person out there I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="206.739" dur="4.59">actually quite an optimist except in</text>
  <text start="208.419" dur="4.591">this situation because it feels like you</text>
  <text start="211.329" dur="3.421">know we&amp;#39;ve come from a long ways from</text>
  <text start="213.01" dur="4.71">the Charlotte is Ruby days you know</text>
  <text start="214.75" dur="5.699">dumbing down America and now we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.72" dur="5.28">full-on just just complete brainwash</text>
  <text start="220.449" dur="4.29">matrix from cradle to the grave almost</text>
  <text start="223" dur="4.799">but especially through the education</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="4.381">system I&amp;#39;m a big fan of what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.799" dur="2.97">doing we&amp;#39;re trying to save kids from</text>
  <text start="229.12" dur="3.119">that although I feel like we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="230.769" dur="4.83">end up saving like a remnant or a</text>
  <text start="232.239" dur="5.43">remnant of a remnant really but how can</text>
  <text start="235.599" dur="4.23">we do that and and maybe if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="237.669" dur="4.68">mind touching a little bit on how we got</text>
  <text start="239.829" dur="5.31">to this point how it got so bad where</text>
  <text start="242.349" dur="5.28">this started shortly yeah Thank You</text>
  <text start="245.139" dur="3.84">Desmond Charlotte urban has to be a good</text>
  <text start="247.629" dur="3.72">friend of mine now I&amp;#39;ve worked very</text>
  <text start="248.979" dur="3.66">closely with her over the years for</text>
  <text start="251.349" dur="3.57">those who don&amp;#39;t know we&amp;#39;re listening to</text>
  <text start="252.639" dur="4.02">this broadcast she was a senior advisor</text>
  <text start="254.919" dur="3.511">at the Department of Education under the</text>
  <text start="256.659" dur="3.241">Reagan administration and she basically</text>
  <text start="258.43" dur="3.39">figured out she got The Smoking Gun</text>
  <text start="259.9" dur="3.96">documents and hey they&amp;#39;re going down the</text>
  <text start="261.82" dur="3.899">kids they&amp;#39;re merging our education</text>
  <text start="263.86" dur="2.26">system with the Soviet education system</text>
  <text start="265.719" dur="2.621">in the</text>
  <text start="266.12" dur="4.14">to create a brain one song bees who will</text>
  <text start="268.34" dur="3.51">be suitable for this new world order</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="3.72">that these maniacs are building and so</text>
  <text start="271.85" dur="3.629">she started leaking these documents and</text>
  <text start="273.98" dur="3.51">amounts of the press and a match of</text>
  <text start="275.479" dur="3.301">reporters and getting them out there and</text>
  <text start="277.49" dur="2.91">it caused quite a scandal at the time</text>
  <text start="278.78" dur="4.08">she ended up getting fired over that</text>
  <text start="280.4" dur="4.23">which is just as well she is she</text>
  <text start="282.86" dur="4.23">obviously was too independent minded to</text>
  <text start="284.63" dur="5.069">freedom minded to be working at a high</text>
  <text start="287.09" dur="4.44">level in the bureaucracy but it really</text>
  <text start="289.699" dur="5.431">was a wake-up call for a lot of people</text>
  <text start="291.53" dur="5.52">and you&amp;#39;re right at the situation since</text>
  <text start="295.13" dur="3.99">then has become infinitely more dire</text>
  <text start="297.05" dur="3.75">right they have perfected the</text>
  <text start="299.12" dur="4.14">brainwashing and the manipulation and</text>
  <text start="300.8" dur="4.02">the dumbing down now way being on what</text>
  <text start="303.26" dur="2.879">they had back then you know I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="3">I&amp;#39;ve never been in a public school in my</text>
  <text start="306.139" dur="3.721">life I&amp;#39;ve actually have never been to an</text>
  <text start="307.82" dur="4.62">American school in my life very much</text>
  <text start="309.86" dur="4.35">yeah that&amp;#39;s what I hear right because my</text>
  <text start="312.44" dur="4.65">brother did a couple years in it said it</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="5.04">was a disaster but um I did have an</text>
  <text start="317.09" dur="3.87">opportunity to study in a lot of gap the</text>
  <text start="319.25" dur="4.8">American public education system and</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="6.06">where it came from as a result of my</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="4.26">work with dr. Sam Blumenfeld he was</text>
  <text start="327.02" dur="3">actually also a very good friend of</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="3.06">Charlotte is ribbit and we dedicated our</text>
  <text start="330.02" dur="3.33">book to Charlotte I serve it to John</text>
  <text start="331.37" dur="5.4">Taylor Gatto and some of these heroes in</text>
  <text start="333.35" dur="5.129">the education field and dr. Blumenfeld</text>
  <text start="336.77" dur="4.47">was another one of those he spent fifty</text>
  <text start="338.479" dur="6.211">years of his life he figured out when he</text>
  <text start="341.24" dur="5.25">read a book by Rudolf Flesch called wine</text>
  <text start="344.69" dur="3.9">Johnny can&amp;#39;t read this just came out</text>
  <text start="346.49" dur="4.26">back in the mid-50s why Johnny can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="348.59" dur="3.78">read the reason why Johnny can&amp;#39;t read is</text>
  <text start="350.75" dur="4.349">because the schools are teaching the</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="5.07">kids to read using a method that has</text>
  <text start="355.099" dur="3.601">been exposed as quackery since the 1840s</text>
  <text start="357.44" dur="3.81">and hopefully we&amp;#39;ll have a chance to get</text>
  <text start="358.7" dur="5.13">into that but to what Sam figured out is</text>
  <text start="361.25" dur="4.34">hate these schools this education</text>
  <text start="363.83" dur="4.44">establishment if you will is</text>
  <text start="365.59" dur="4.03">deliberately turning American children</text>
  <text start="368.27" dur="2.67">into illiterates this isn&amp;#39;t just some</text>
  <text start="369.62" dur="2.88">kind of a big accident like you know</text>
  <text start="370.94" dur="3">after thousands of years suddenly forgot</text>
  <text start="372.5" dur="3.69">how to teach kids to read you know</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="3.63">Americans were the most literate society</text>
  <text start="376.19" dur="3.12">in the world before we had government</text>
  <text start="377.57" dur="4.2">schools and this quackery was introduced</text>
  <text start="379.31" dur="4.979">and so he dedicated his life to this he</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="3.93">wrote I think 13 books on public</text>
  <text start="384.289" dur="3.301">education everything from you know</text>
  <text start="385.7" dur="3.48">exposing the teachers unions the</text>
  <text start="387.59" dur="3.15">National Education Association which we</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="3.66">called the Trojan horse in American</text>
  <text start="390.74" dur="4.83">education to um you know asking the</text>
  <text start="392.84" dur="5.46">question is public education necessary</text>
  <text start="395.57" dur="3.87">do we really need government to educate</text>
  <text start="398.3" dur="3.6">actually</text>
  <text start="399.44" dur="4.47">quotation marks educate people and his</text>
  <text start="401.9" dur="3.45">answer was no but we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="403.91" dur="3.21">government to educate people how do we</text>
  <text start="405.35" dur="3.78">know because we the government didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="407.12" dur="3.96">used to educate people in America and we</text>
  <text start="409.13" dur="4.65">would like far the most educated people</text>
  <text start="411.08" dur="5.04">in the world if you go back and look at</text>
  <text start="413.78" dur="3.63">people in the founding era for example</text>
  <text start="416.12" dur="2.79">the overwhelming majority of them were</text>
  <text start="417.41" dur="2.82">homeschooled occasionally with a little</text>
  <text start="418.91" dur="4.53">bit of help from a tutor or from the</text>
  <text start="420.23" dur="6.39">church local citizens a dram on uncle</text>
  <text start="423.44" dur="5.61">aunt whatever it was and if you look at</text>
  <text start="426.62" dur="4.35">just the data that we have we were</text>
  <text start="429.05" dur="3.57">infinitely more literate than we are</text>
  <text start="430.97" dur="3.24">today right yeah I mean depending on</text>
  <text start="432.62" dur="4.41">whose data you believe something like 80</text>
  <text start="434.21" dur="4.95">to 95 percent of Americans at that time</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="3.69">especially in the north could we eat if</text>
  <text start="439.16" dur="2.94">you look at the data today I put into</text>
  <text start="440.72" dur="3.51">the federal government&amp;#39;s own numbers</text>
  <text start="442.1" dur="3.75">something like half of Americans are</text>
  <text start="444.23" dur="3.09">either illiterate or so close to a</text>
  <text start="445.85" dur="3.84">literate that we might as well dump them</text>
  <text start="447.32" dur="4.44">in the same category and you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="449.69" dur="3.6">a tragedy that&amp;#39;s a travesty we spend a</text>
  <text start="451.76" dur="4.02">trillion dollars a year on this</text>
  <text start="453.29" dur="3.72">so-called education system and the kids</text>
  <text start="455.78" dur="2.94">are graduating they can&amp;#39;t even read</text>
  <text start="457.01" dur="4.56">their high school diploma I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.72" dur="4.47">how bad it&amp;#39;s gotten so again the</text>
  <text start="461.57" dur="3.51">manipulation now has become much more</text>
  <text start="463.19" dur="3.72">scientific they took a lot of insight</text>
  <text start="465.08" dur="3.66">that was clean from Soviet Union I</text>
  <text start="466.91" dur="3.75">thought they had that pseudo scientist</text>
  <text start="468.74" dur="5.16">over there working on creating the new</text>
  <text start="470.66" dur="4.59">Soviet man through indoctrination and</text>
  <text start="473.9" dur="3.39">they got really really good at it right</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;ve had more than a hundred years</text>
  <text start="477.29" dur="8.25">now of trying to perfect this system to</text>
  <text start="481.52" dur="6.75">really fundamentally change people right</text>
  <text start="485.54" dur="4.56">to move them away from our American</text>

  <text start="490.1" dur="5.46">freedom of constitutionally limited</text>
  <text start="492.38" dur="4.89">government the Christian heritage of</text>
  <text start="495.56" dur="4.92">America so the schools have deliberately</text>
  <text start="497.27" dur="5.46">been moving away from that over the last</text>
  <text start="500.48" dur="3.99">century and we have smoking gun proof of</text>
  <text start="502.73" dur="3.51">it you know the architects of this</text>
  <text start="504.47" dur="3.09">school we have their own papers we have</text>
  <text start="506.24" dur="3.24">their own essays we have their own</text>

  <text start="509.48" dur="3.749">saying among themselves and not in</text>
  <text start="511.22" dur="3.36">public we know that that was their goal</text>
  <text start="513.229" dur="4.531">they wanted to turn America into a</text>

  <text start="517.76" dur="4.38">lot of this in crime to the educators</text>
  <text start="519.71" dur="3.959">and during to the last part of your</text>
  <text start="522.14" dur="4.23">question what do we do about this I</text>
  <text start="523.669" dur="4.141">think you know there&amp;#39;s so many people</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="4.14">out there who are well-meaning who are</text>
  <text start="527.81" dur="4.2">on our side on most of these issues and</text>
  <text start="530.51" dur="2.87">they say yeah but we need to reform the</text>
  <text start="532.01" dur="3.11">schools right we just need to make</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="3.66">I&amp;#39;m better we just need to you know fix</text>
  <text start="535.12" dur="4.14">the history curriculum or we need to get</text>
  <text start="537.04" dur="4.89">the same words out so the kids can learn</text>
  <text start="539.26" dur="4.23">how to read well any more money or money</text>
  <text start="541.93" dur="3.03">oh that&amp;#39;s the you know that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="543.49" dur="2.73">filicide always it&amp;#39;s just we just need</text>
  <text start="544.96" dur="3.24">more money we just need more power</text>
  <text start="546.22" dur="3.3">exactly and it has an absolute farce I</text>
  <text start="548.2" dur="3.45">mean the data shows that&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="549.52" dur="3.45">false more money will just make the</text>
  <text start="551.65" dur="4.07">situation worse</text>
  <text start="552.97" dur="5.82">and so I&amp;#39;m convinced now the only</text>
  <text start="555.72" dur="4.63">solution is for parents to protect their</text>
  <text start="558.79" dur="3.78">children from this that means getting</text>
  <text start="560.35" dur="3.96">them out of the schools and there&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="562.57" dur="3.3">know a huge diversity of options in</text>
  <text start="564.31" dur="3.09">America you can send them to a private</text>
  <text start="565.87" dur="3.09">school you can send them to a Christian</text>
  <text start="567.4" dur="3.81">school you can homeschool and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="568.96" dur="4.59">you know thousands of home school</text>
  <text start="571.21" dur="3.77">curricula and resources and material out</text>
  <text start="573.55" dur="4.5">there you can join the homeschool co-op</text>
  <text start="574.98" dur="5.11">you can give them to you know grandma to</text>
  <text start="578.05" dur="3.45">homeschool for two or three days out of</text>
  <text start="580.09" dur="3.12">the week if you&amp;#39;re so busy with work</text>
  <text start="581.5" dur="3.42">that you have no time to do it there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.21" dur="3.33">all these different options out there at</text>
  <text start="584.92" dur="3.87">this point there&amp;#39;s no longer an excuse</text>
  <text start="586.54" dur="3.96">for Americans to continue sending their</text>
  <text start="588.79" dur="4.41">children to these brainwash centers it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="590.5" dur="4.08">just that simple and so you know when</text>
  <text start="593.2" dur="3.81">you boil it all down I think that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="594.58" dur="4.71">solution we need a massive exodus out of</text>
  <text start="597.01" dur="3.84">the school system and we hope that our</text>
  <text start="599.29" dur="3.21">upcoming project we&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="600.85" dur="3.09">start with a special issue in the new</text>

  <text start="603.94" dur="4.35">2019 that&amp;#39;s going to be kind of a</text>
  <text start="606.43" dur="4.05">kickoff for us we&amp;#39;re gonna be getting</text>
  <text start="608.29" dur="3.63">the word out getting this issue out as</text>
  <text start="610.48" dur="3.3">many as we can hopefully hundreds of</text>
  <text start="611.92" dur="4.14">thousands of copies turn that into a</text>
  <text start="613.78" dur="4.17">book go out on a speaking tour do you</text>
  <text start="616.06" dur="4.65">know hundreds of radio and TV interviews</text>
  <text start="617.95" dur="4.68">and you know if we can reach that we</text>
  <text start="620.71" dur="4.56">probably reach several million people if</text>
  <text start="622.63" dur="3.93">not more with the last book prime to the</text>
  <text start="625.27" dur="4.53">educators we think we can reach that</text>
  <text start="626.56" dur="4.29">many if not more this time and then it</text>
  <text start="629.8" dur="2.58">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that that maybe people read</text>
  <text start="630.85" dur="3.69">the book but they heard us on radio they</text>
  <text start="632.38" dur="4.83">watched us on TV so we can reach them</text>
  <text start="634.54" dur="5.64">many people again and this time with the</text>

  <text start="656.14" dur="5.28">seeds one way or the other for sure and</text>

  <text start="666.19" dur="3.08">seems then</text>
  <text start="666.84" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pretty bad there you tell you</text>
  <text start="669.27" dur="3.54">actually teach it like an online form of</text>
  <text start="671.43" dur="3.96">schooling as well would you touch on</text>
  <text start="672.81" dur="4.02">that real fast sure yeah I do and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="675.39" dur="4.08">great honor and a privilege to do that</text>
  <text start="676.83" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s called the freedom project Academy</text>
  <text start="679.47" dur="5.88">and we&amp;#39;re an online K through 12</text>

  <text start="691.05" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re at about a thousand very close to</text>
  <text start="693.029" dur="5.491">it Allison so just phenomenal rate of</text>
  <text start="695.37" dur="5.61">growth as where it gets out and what we</text>
  <text start="698.52" dur="4.56">do is we provide a world-class education</text>
  <text start="700.98" dur="3.72">I mean better than just about anything</text>
  <text start="703.08" dur="2.82">you know what I mean I can say with a</text>
  <text start="704.7" dur="2.579">hundred percent confidence is better</text>
  <text start="705.9" dur="3.33">than anything you will get from the</text>
  <text start="707.279" dur="3.211">government infinitely better right your</text>
  <text start="709.23" dur="2.67">kids will learn how to read using</text>
  <text start="710.49" dur="3.12">phonics so they will actually be able to</text>
  <text start="711.9" dur="3.21">read they&amp;#39;ll learn real math they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="713.61" dur="3.6">learn real history they&amp;#39;ll learn real</text>
  <text start="715.11" dur="4.14">science right so they&amp;#39;ll learn truth</text>
  <text start="717.21" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;ll learn how to discover truth they</text>
  <text start="719.25" dur="4.02">will learn logic and rhetoric you know</text>
  <text start="721.92" dur="3.48">all the things that the schools try</text>
  <text start="723.27" dur="3.48">their best to conceal and we do it at a</text>
  <text start="725.4" dur="3.12">fraction of the cost and so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="726.75" dur="4.23">essentially totally online we have a</text>
  <text start="728.52" dur="5.069">brick and mortar building in in</text>
  <text start="730.98" dur="4.77">Wisconsin but all that happens there is</text>
  <text start="733.589" dur="3.691">really the administration the technology</text>
  <text start="735.75" dur="3.3">side of things our teachers are spread</text>
  <text start="737.28" dur="3.03">out across the country and across the</text>
  <text start="739.05" dur="3.36">world I&amp;#39;m actually sitting in Greece</text>
  <text start="740.31" dur="3.81">right now and ten minutes before we</text>
  <text start="742.41" dur="4.47">started I was teaching my advanced</text>
  <text start="744.12" dur="5.01">economics class and so what we do is we</text>
  <text start="746.88" dur="3.6">get the kids from all over right kids</text>
  <text start="749.13" dur="2.85">from all over the country I&amp;#39;ve had kids</text>
  <text start="750.48" dur="3.66">from all over the world right kids of</text>
  <text start="751.98" dur="4.71">missionaries in Dominican Republic or</text>
  <text start="754.14" dur="4.35">South Africa whatever it is and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="756.69" dur="4.05">able to provide them a high quality</text>
  <text start="758.49" dur="4.47">education for a very very little money</text>
  <text start="760.74" dur="5.31">and I think this you know if the</text>
  <text start="762.96" dur="4.62">government wasn&amp;#39;t completely distorting</text>
  <text start="766.05" dur="3.03">the market this would probably be the</text>
  <text start="767.58" dur="3.15">future of education right because you</text>
  <text start="769.08" dur="3.99">can provide the kids an amazing</text>
  <text start="770.73" dur="4.08">education for a couple thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="773.07" dur="3.66">a year whereas the school squander you</text>
  <text start="774.81" dur="4.77">know twenty twenty-five thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="776.73" dur="4.56">a year per student you know we at</text>
  <text start="779.58" dur="3.78">freedom project Academy we can do it for</text>
  <text start="781.29" dur="4.53">1/10 that price or less and the</text>
  <text start="783.36" dur="3.93">education will be infinitely superior so</text>
  <text start="785.82" dur="4.019">that&amp;#39;s one of the things I do I teach</text>
  <text start="787.29" dur="4.049">advanced economics there and we have a</text>
  <text start="789.839" dur="3.481">media on - it&amp;#39;s called the freedom</text>
  <text start="791.339" dur="3.901">project media where we&amp;#39;re putting out</text>

  <text start="810.449" dur="3.39">middle school to teach the kids you know</text>
  <text start="812.129" dur="3.931">the joys of being apparently a drag</text>

  <text start="816.06" dur="3.029">twelve year old kids my teaching them</text>
  <text start="817.649" dur="3.18">the things that they need to be drag</text>
  <text start="819.089" dur="3">queens for a career so we just expose</text>
  <text start="820.829" dur="3.63">that kind of stuff just to make it</text>
  <text start="822.089" dur="4.711">absolutely clear to parents you know the</text>
  <text start="824.459" dur="5.31">the urgency of getting their kids out of</text>
  <text start="826.8" dur="4.26">this cesspool and it&amp;#39;s an amazing thing</text>
  <text start="829.769" dur="2.641">you know it really is it&amp;#39;s a K through</text>
  <text start="831.06" dur="3.99">12 school so we started mouthing</text>

  <text start="835.05" dur="3.87">elementary school that pretty much take</text>
  <text start="836.49" dur="4.139">the full course load but once they get</text>
  <text start="838.92" dur="3.959">older you know I teach for example</text>
  <text start="840.629" dur="3.75">advanced economics so you know if</text>
  <text start="842.879" dur="3.361">parents want to homeschool their kids</text>
  <text start="844.379" dur="3.27">and teach them history and math and</text>
  <text start="846.24" dur="2.49">English themselves but then they say</text>
  <text start="847.649" dur="4.23">well you know I don&amp;#39;t really know much</text>
  <text start="848.73" dur="5.459">about chemistry or Latin or advanced</text>
  <text start="851.879" dur="4.051">economics you know they can enroll in a</text>
  <text start="854.189" dur="4.111">few courses that way so you know pick</text>
  <text start="855.93" dur="4.23">and choose kind of a menu but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="858.3" dur="3.719">an amazing day it&amp;#39;s really amazing to be</text>
  <text start="860.16" dur="4.26">a part of it and I can say with absolute</text>

  <text start="869.04" dur="5.399">are just so intelligent so so</text>
  <text start="872.31" dur="4.379">knowledgeable so learn it so they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1483.61" dur="3.78">him to a government school because the</text>
  <text start="1485.56" dur="4.68">government schools are not just doing a</text>
  <text start="1487.39" dur="5.01">bad job educating right we need to get</text>
  <text start="1490.24" dur="4.68">over this as a society you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="1492.4" dur="4.29">Americans think well you know yeah the</text>
  <text start="1494.92" dur="3.45">kids aren&amp;#39;t doing that well yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1496.69" dur="4.53">not a great education but at least it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1498.37" dur="4.47">an education no it&amp;#39;s not right it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1501.22" dur="4.26">opposite of an education they were</text>
  <text start="1502.84" dur="4.95">permanently handicapping these children</text>
  <text start="1505.48" dur="4.59">you mentioned brain damage I think kind</text>
  <text start="1507.79" dur="4.08">of kiddingly but um you know what we</text>
  <text start="1510.07" dur="3.84">argue what we show in crime to the</text>
  <text start="1511.87" dur="4.32">educators of what a lot of this modern</text>
  <text start="1513.91" dur="3.81">neuroscience has shown now is that the</text>
  <text start="1516.19" dur="3">government schools and him even some</text>
  <text start="1517.72" dur="2.7">private schools that use these quack</text>
  <text start="1519.19" dur="2.82">methods that are used in the public</text>
  <text start="1520.42" dur="3.9">schools under common core and that have</text>
  <text start="1522.01" dur="4.02">been used since the time of John Dewey</text>
  <text start="1524.32" dur="4.2">and before him for us ma&amp;#39;am tried it out</text>
  <text start="1526.03" dur="4.53">he was kind of the architect of</text>
  <text start="1528.52" dur="5.34">government schools in Massachusetts back</text>
  <text start="1530.56" dur="4.92">in the mid 1800s what happens is and</text>
  <text start="1533.86" dur="3.42">maybe this is a good time now just to</text>
  <text start="1535.48" dur="5.97">get into a little bit about the the</text>
  <text start="1537.28" dur="4.89">reading methodologies the method that</text>
  <text start="1541.45" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re using now</text>
  <text start="1542.17" dur="4.77">and that was pioneered by Horace Mann</text>
  <text start="1545.14" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s a lot of different terms that</text>
  <text start="1546.94" dur="2.64">they use to kind of cover up what</text>
  <text start="1548.47" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;re doing because every time it gets</text>
  <text start="1549.58" dur="4.47">exposed they come up with a new term to</text>
  <text start="1551.26" dur="5.31">conceal what they&amp;#39;re doing it was been</text>
  <text start="1554.05" dur="5.07">called the whole word method the the</text>
  <text start="1556.57" dur="5.91">looks say method the sight word method</text>
  <text start="1559.12" dur="4.74">and in a nutshell you know we can go</text>
  <text start="1562.48" dur="3.51">back to the beginning when Horace Mann</text>
  <text start="1563.86" dur="3.42">II was the first Education Commissioner</text>
  <text start="1565.99" dur="2.55">that we ever had in the US who was the</text>
  <text start="1567.28" dur="3.78">Education Commissioner for the state of</text>
  <text start="1568.54" dur="4.02">Massachusetts he went over to Prussia he</text>
  <text start="1571.06" dur="2.82">was really impressed with the government</text>
  <text start="1572.56" dur="2.67">and doctrine nation system there you</text>
  <text start="1573.88" dur="3.78">know brainwashing all the kids to be</text>
  <text start="1575.23" dur="3.75">status and obedient and all the rest of</text>
  <text start="1577.66" dur="3.84">it and so he thought well that&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1578.98" dur="5.25">perfect for Massachusetts and there was</text>
  <text start="1581.5" dur="4.35">a reverend at around this time called</text>
  <text start="1584.23" dur="3.6">Reverend Gordo death and he had come up</text>
  <text start="1585.85" dur="3.69">with this very innovative way to teach</text>
  <text start="1587.83" dur="4.17">deaf children how to read</text>
  <text start="1589.54" dur="4.8">you know deaf children can&amp;#39;t hear and so</text>
  <text start="1592" dur="4.35">you can&amp;#39;t really teach them the sounds</text>
  <text start="1594.34" dur="3.78">that the letters make and so they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1596.35" dur="3.12">learn to read phonetically you know they</text>
  <text start="1598.12" dur="2.64">have a unique handicap</text>
  <text start="1599.47" dur="3.36">that prevents them from being able to</text>
  <text start="1600.76" dur="3.36">learn how to read using phonics and so</text>
  <text start="1602.83" dur="2.94">what are you playing here was this idea</text>
  <text start="1604.12" dur="3.87">that hey we&amp;#39;ll just teach them to</text>
  <text start="1605.77" dur="3.75">memorize entire words like you know if</text>
  <text start="1607.99" dur="3.6">you go to China if you look at the way</text>
  <text start="1609.52" dur="5.31">that they write their a character a</text>
  <text start="1611.59" dur="6.99">symbol represents you know word an idea</text>
  <text start="1614.83" dur="5.729">a concept an action or whatever it is it</text>
  <text start="1618.58" dur="4.62">represents a whole thing and so you have</text>
  <text start="1620.559" dur="4.921">to memorize thousands and thousands of</text>
  <text start="1623.2" dur="4.14">characters of symbols which in and of</text>
  <text start="1625.48" dur="3.42">themselves represent a whole word but</text>
  <text start="1627.34" dur="3.24">our language our writing system the</text>
  <text start="1628.9" dur="3.42">phonetic writing system is completely</text>
  <text start="1630.58" dur="3.9">different I mean we have a system where</text>
  <text start="1632.32" dur="4.17">symbols don&amp;#39;t represent words they</text>
  <text start="1634.48" dur="3.78">represent sounds and you put these</text>
  <text start="1636.49" dur="4.26">sounds together and then you spell out</text>
  <text start="1638.26" dur="4.5">the word so if you have cat for example</text>
  <text start="1640.75" dur="4.59">you don&amp;#39;t memorize that this series of</text>
  <text start="1642.76" dur="4.14">squiggly lines means cat unless you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1645.34" dur="4.05">in a government school in America today</text>
  <text start="1646.9" dur="5.1">what you do is you memorize the fact</text>
  <text start="1649.39" dur="5.01">that a c&amp;#39; makes a cup sound in most</text>
  <text start="1652" dur="4.919">cases or a sound depending and the DEA</text>
  <text start="1654.4" dur="4.44">makes an up sound and the tea makes it</text>
  <text start="1656.919" dur="4.231">sound and you figure out how to blend</text>
  <text start="1658.84" dur="4.079">them and you get cat and that allows you</text>
  <text start="1661.15" dur="3.93">to read basically anything right you can</text>
  <text start="1662.919" dur="4.291">put any sound that a person would make</text>
  <text start="1665.08" dur="3.719">any twist down on paper and anybody else</text>
  <text start="1667.21" dur="3.66">who understands our phonetic writing</text>
  <text start="1668.799" dur="4.411">system can read it so this is how it</text>
  <text start="1670.87" dur="4.2">worked for thousands of years and then</text>
  <text start="1673.21" dur="4.02">go to death pioneer pioneered this idea</text>
  <text start="1675.07" dur="3.9">of hey we could get children how to read</text>
  <text start="1677.23" dur="4.199">a little bit at least by having them</text>
  <text start="1678.97" dur="3.839">memorize whole words and this guy Horace</text>
  <text start="1681.429" dur="4.021">Mann the guy who went over to Prussia</text>
  <text start="1682.809" dur="4.441">and adopted this Prussian system brought</text>
  <text start="1685.45" dur="3.81">it to Massachusetts said hey we could</text>
  <text start="1687.25" dur="4.289">try that on non deaf children in the</text>
  <text start="1689.26" dur="4.32">schools in Boston and so they did the</text>
  <text start="1691.539" dur="5.13">experiment lasted a few years and it was</text>
  <text start="1693.58" dur="5.52">an absolute total disaster right it</text>
  <text start="1696.669" dur="4.051">caused some massive a literacy crisis to</text>
  <text start="1699.1" dur="4.439">the point where within a few years the</text>
  <text start="1700.72" dur="5.25">31 schoolmaster 32 school masters in</text>
  <text start="1703.539" dur="5.671">Boston got together and they wrote this</text>
  <text start="1705.97" dur="4.65">open letter to Horace Mann and they say</text>
  <text start="1709.21" dur="3.69">hey you know maybe you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1710.62" dur="3.66">well-intentioned but this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="1712.9" dur="3.72">ludicrous we&amp;#39;re not going to continue</text>
  <text start="1714.28" dur="4.56">doing this it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense you</text>
  <text start="1716.62" dur="3.48">can&amp;#39;t teach kids to read this way we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1718.84" dur="2.85">gonna stop doing and we&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="1720.1" dur="3.39">do the same way we&amp;#39;ve done for thousands</text>
  <text start="1721.69" dur="5.729">of years and so that was the end of it</text>
  <text start="1723.49" dur="5.73">this is this quackery until John Dewey</text>
  <text start="1727.419" dur="3.301">came along right we talked about John</text>
  <text start="1729.22" dur="3.57">Dewey earlier they are the founding</text>
  <text start="1730.72" dur="4.02">father of America&amp;#39;s modern public age</text>
  <text start="1732.79" dur="3.84">system and he said well you know I want</text>
  <text start="1734.74" dur="4.05">to dumb down the kids I want them to you</text>
  <text start="1736.63" dur="4.32">know stop being individualistic and</text>
  <text start="1738.79" dur="4.32">capitalist and all the rest of it and so</text>
  <text start="1740.95" dur="4.35">this whole word meant that that will be</text>
  <text start="1743.11" dur="4.02">perfect and so he along with his some of</text>
  <text start="1745.3" dur="3.84">his colleagues you know you Genesis and</text>
  <text start="1747.13" dur="3.48">pseudo scientists and psychologists and</text>
  <text start="1749.14" dur="3.81">all the rest of it who had this</text>
  <text start="1750.61" dur="4.08">grandiose plan of reengineering society</text>
  <text start="1752.95" dur="3.63">they got together in this item eight</text>
  <text start="1754.69" dur="4.32">will take over the teachers colleges</text>
  <text start="1756.58" dur="4.95">will create some reading primers based</text>
  <text start="1759.01" dur="3.75">other primers based on this quiet</text>
  <text start="1761.53" dur="2.7">commended and we&amp;#39;ll have them</text>
  <text start="1762.76" dur="3.69">distributed all across the United States</text>
  <text start="1764.23" dur="3.96">and then you know at first they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1766.45" dur="3.87">very successful and then you know even</text>
  <text start="1768.19" dur="4.29">up until World War two when when all the</text>
  <text start="1770.32" dur="3.93">money was off you know being spent on</text>
  <text start="1772.48" dur="3.36">the war there wasn&amp;#39;t a lot of money to</text>
  <text start="1774.25" dur="3.42">for this to be rolled out while a little</text>
  <text start="1775.84" dur="3.42">bit after World War two all the schools</text>
  <text start="1777.67" dur="3.27">all the school districts were flush with</text>
  <text start="1779.26" dur="3.36">all this money and they started buying</text>
  <text start="1780.94" dur="3.75">these books you probably don&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="1782.62" dur="3.51">in them Dustin and neither do i but you</text>
  <text start="1784.69" dur="2.88">know for our parents generation for our</text>
  <text start="1786.13" dur="3.93">grandparents generation they were used</text>
  <text start="1787.57" dur="4.59">to learn to read with like yeah the Dick</text>
  <text start="1790.06" dur="5.45">and Jane series you know see spot run</text>
  <text start="1792.16" dur="6.27">run spot run and what this was was</text>
  <text start="1795.51" dur="5.8">memorizing entire world so rather than</text>
  <text start="1798.43" dur="4.89">teaching the kids you know tea makes a</text>
  <text start="1801.31" dur="4.35">tough sound they would say when you see</text>
  <text start="1803.32" dur="4.35">this series of squiggly lines that means</text>

  <text start="1807.67" dur="5.58">lines that means bitch and on and on it</text>
  <text start="1810.13" dur="4.8">goes right and so this doesn&amp;#39;t work it</text>
  <text start="1813.25" dur="4.02">clearly doesn&amp;#39;t work that this was first</text>

  <text start="1859.18" dur="3.63">anyways the the word is getting out now</text>
  <text start="1860.86" dur="3.3">and to go back to the subject of brain</text>

  <text start="1864.16" dur="4.08">here there are have now</text>
  <text start="1865.84" dur="4.65">in numerous scientific studies where</text>

  <text start="1872.71" dur="4.89">it is modern brain imaging these</text>

  <text start="1894.909" dur="4.02">brain damage is already done and what</text>
  <text start="1896.98" dur="3.72">they see on these brain scans is that</text>

  <text start="1909.82" dur="5.13">they had learned the proper way so this</text>
  <text start="1911.409" dur="6.931">has incredible implications if you go to</text>
  <text start="1914.95" dur="5.94">some of our places in America Washington</text>
  <text start="1918.34" dur="4.17">DC is a good example according to the</text>

  <text start="2170.29" dur="5.37">that we had such a good education system</text>
  <text start="2171.82" dur="5.49">as you know is there was a huge</text>

  <text start="2179.14" dur="3.93">earn money for their family by providing</text>

  <text start="2183.07" dur="4.11">compete on a massive level with all of</text>
  <text start="2185.65" dur="3.45">the other educators out there to earn</text>
  <text start="2187.18" dur="5.04">that money so you would go give a</text>
  <text start="2189.1" dur="5.51">top-notch education you would try to you</text>
  <text start="2192.22" dur="4.53">know have the best reputation out there</text>
  <text start="2194.61" dur="3.64">you would you would do all of those</text>
  <text start="2196.75" dur="3.81">things that a smart business would do in</text>
  <text start="2198.25" dur="3.81">order to gain new customers these being</text>

  <text start="2207.64" dur="5.97">teachers you&amp;#39;re not gonna get that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2211.9" dur="3.24">exactly right to us in any way I know a</text>
  <text start="2213.61" dur="2.73">lot of teachers who are good people and</text>
  <text start="2215.14" dur="2.61">they really want the right thing you</text>
  <text start="2216.34" dur="3.06">know they bill someone believe in</text>
  <text start="2217.75" dur="2.91">liberty and you know most of them</text>
  <text start="2219.4" dur="3.81">homeschool their kids of course because</text>
  <text start="2220.66" dur="5.46">they know what you&amp;#39;re exactly right only</text>
  <text start="2223.21" dur="5.79">be the institution as it exists and the</text>
  <text start="2226.12" dur="5.85">incentive structure that is inherent in</text>
  <text start="2229" dur="5.55">a government-funded education system is</text>
  <text start="2231.97" dur="5.55">problematic from the start so even if</text>
  <text start="2234.55" dur="4.62">you had well-intentioned people setting</text>
  <text start="2237.52" dur="3.93">up this system which you don&amp;#39;t it would</text>
  <text start="2239.17" dur="4.5">still be a failure now when you add to</text>
  <text start="2241.45" dur="4.05">that the next layer of people with ill</text>

  <text start="2245.5" dur="3">it&amp;#39;s very easy to prove that the people</text>
  <text start="2247.27" dur="4.44">who set up the system and people are</text>
  <text start="2248.5" dur="4.98">still running today have ill intent then</text>
  <text start="2251.71" dur="3.66">you compound that problem because you</text>
  <text start="2253.48" dur="2.44">have a system that has basically</text>
  <text start="2255.37" dur="3.1">infinite</text>
  <text start="2255.92" dur="4.8">money at its disposal that has 87% of</text>
  <text start="2258.47" dur="4.62">the children to work on and it has a</text>
  <text start="2260.72" dur="3.93">very nefarious agenda to dumb down any</text>
  <text start="2263.09" dur="3.96">doctrine a population for sinister</text>
  <text start="2264.65" dur="4.23">purposes so you end up with what I</text>
  <text start="2267.05" dur="3.81">consider to be one of the most</text>
  <text start="2268.88" dur="4.47">significant if not the most significant</text>
  <text start="2270.86" dur="5.76">problems facing our country today which</text>
  <text start="2273.35" dur="5.19">is the government&amp;#39;s so-called education</text>
  <text start="2276.62" dur="4.47">system dumbing down and indoctrinating</text>
  <text start="2278.54" dur="5.1">the kids and then it goes back to what</text>
  <text start="2281.09" dur="5.01">we said at the very beginning this is</text>
  <text start="2283.64" dur="4.32">going to be a major problem for all of</text>
  <text start="2286.1" dur="3.39">us you know even if we succeed in</text>
  <text start="2287.96" dur="5.31">protecting our own kids I obviously</text>
  <text start="2289.49" dur="6.15">homeschool most of the people who I know</text>
  <text start="2293.27" dur="3.81">and love at this point now Holmes you</text>
  <text start="2295.64" dur="2.67">know you can&amp;#39;t be around for too long</text>
  <text start="2297.08" dur="2.88">without having to say you need to</text>
  <text start="2298.31" dur="4.08">home-school okay so most of the people I</text>
  <text start="2299.96" dur="4.53">know and love now also homeschool their</text>
  <text start="2302.39" dur="4.7">kids but we need to recognize it you</text>
  <text start="2304.49" dur="5.22">know 87 percent of kids is the</text>
  <text start="2307.09" dur="4.15">approximation that we have the number of</text>
  <text start="2309.71" dur="3.51">kids are in government schools right now</text>
  <text start="2311.24" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s a lot of kids and you know mine</text>
  <text start="2313.22" dur="3.21">my estimates are that you know that the</text>
  <text start="2315.11" dur="2.58">brain power of kids who are</text>
  <text start="2316.43" dur="2.82">home-schooled and getting a good</text>

  <text start="2319.25" dur="3">the cracks in the government school</text>
  <text start="2320.36" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s probably you know ten times more</text>
  <text start="2322.25" dur="4.2">than your everyday a victim of</text>

  <text start="2333.41" dur="3.96">their caretaker</text>
  <text start="2334.85" dur="5.85">you know they&amp;#39;re being taught all of</text>

  <text start="2497.05" dur="3.69">didn&amp;#39;t touch on this but there is a</text>
  <text start="2498.22" dur="4.13">culture and I don&amp;#39;t remember the exact</text>
  <text start="2500.74" dur="4.74">word for this but there&amp;#39;s a culture of</text>
  <text start="2502.35" dur="4.93">thinking that the Dumber you are the</text>

  <text start="2514.69" dur="3.57">emulate and that they they look up to</text>
  <text start="2516.43" dur="3.66">now rather than their there have been</text>
  <text start="2518.26" dur="4.14">points in history where people looked up</text>
  <text start="2520.09" dur="5.279">to educated people they looked up to</text>
  <text start="2522.4" dur="7.159">thinkers now we&amp;#39;re looking up two great</text>
  <text start="2525.369" dur="7.891">thugs and it&amp;#39;s necessarily a good a good</text>
  <text start="2529.559" dur="6.941">culture for them to to want to prove</text>
  <text start="2533.26" dur="4.68">themselves or to want to you know all</text>
  <text start="2536.5" dur="2.849">the things that kids go through when</text>

  <text start="2539.349" dur="4.351">rites of passage you know this this</text>
  <text start="2541.18" dur="3.21">plays into all of that stuff as well and</text>
  <text start="2543.7" dur="2.909">it yeah</text>
  <text start="2544.39" dur="4.02">if I&amp;#39;ve seen that in my own brother and</text>
  <text start="2546.609" dur="4.26">sisters lives they they grew up in that</text>
  <text start="2548.41" dur="5.459">culture and it just part of what led</text>
  <text start="2550.869" dur="6.271">them to drugs led them to ruining their</text>
  <text start="2553.869" dur="5.49">lives just kind of off the tracks so</text>
  <text start="2557.14" dur="4.139">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s victims to this in the</text>
  <text start="2559.359" dur="3.21">now there&amp;#39;s victims to this in the</text>

  <text start="2563.95" dur="4.44">undo all of that damage and then there</text>
  <text start="2566.589" dur="3.121">are victims in the future when these</text>
  <text start="2568.39" dur="3.56">people have finally hit critical mass</text>
  <text start="2569.71" dur="4.74">they can just outnumber us completely</text>
  <text start="2571.95" dur="5.109">that&amp;#39;s exactly right and you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2574.45" dur="4.05">the real danger you know it&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="2577.059" dur="3">that we all protect our own kids from</text>
  <text start="2578.5" dur="3.63">this but we also need to recognize that</text>
  <text start="2580.059" dur="3.451">you know just that is not going to be</text>
  <text start="2582.13" dur="2.669">enough we need to spread the word we</text>
  <text start="2583.51" dur="3.089">need to make everybody else aware</text>
  <text start="2584.799" dur="3.961">because you know all they need</text>
  <text start="2586.599" dur="3.601">technically is 51% they&amp;#39;ve got everybody</text>
  <text start="2588.76" dur="2.579">thinking now we&amp;#39;re a democracy they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2590.2" dur="3.119">just gonna start voting on our rights</text>
  <text start="2591.339" dur="3.78">away start voting our wealth away start</text>
  <text start="2593.319" dur="3.841">voting our freedom away start voting our</text>
  <text start="2595.119" dur="4.5">ability to protect our own families from</text>
  <text start="2597.16" dur="4.47">this and you know we need to recognize</text>
  <text start="2599.619" dur="5.341">that this is an existential struggle if</text>
  <text start="2601.63" dur="4.739">we lose here you know that&amp;#39;s it you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2604.96" dur="3.3">not going to be able to just live your</text>
  <text start="2606.369" dur="3.75">life in peace and run your own business</text>
  <text start="2608.26" dur="3.63">and homeschool your own kids that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="2610.119" dur="4.831">gonna come that&amp;#39;s all gonna go away if</text>
  <text start="2611.89" dur="4.53">the other side wins this battle and it</text>
  <text start="2614.95" dur="2.879">meant a lot of progress they have up a</text>
  <text start="2616.42" dur="3.75">massive head start on us</text>
  <text start="2617.829" dur="4.081">people are going to start blowing the</text>
  <text start="2620.17" dur="4.139">whistle on this until decades</text>
  <text start="2621.91" dur="4.56">generations after it kind of became</text>
  <text start="2624.309" dur="4.081">entrenched so we&amp;#39;ve got a big battle</text>
  <text start="2626.47" dur="3.839">ahead of us but to like you Gus and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2628.39" dur="3.199">also optimistic for a lot of reasons and</text>
  <text start="2630.309" dur="3.421">I see the kids that are in my class</text>
  <text start="2631.589" dur="5.02">actually the kids you know the home</text>
  <text start="2633.73" dur="5.099">school kids around us and that is really</text>
  <text start="2636.609" dur="3.631">inspiring and you realize that some good</text>
  <text start="2638.829" dur="2.46">things are happening and you see kids</text>
  <text start="2640.24" dur="4.74">who come out of the public school system</text>
  <text start="2641.289" dur="5.07">who somehow are okay right somehow they</text>
  <text start="2644.98" dur="3.51">slip through the cracks they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2646.359" dur="3.391">indoctrinated maybe their parents taught</text>
  <text start="2648.49" dur="2.49">them how to read properly when they were</text>
  <text start="2649.75" dur="2.789">kids or maybe they had a good teacher</text>
  <text start="2650.98" dur="3.27">there&amp;#39;s still a lot of renegade teachers</text>
  <text start="2652.539" dur="2.941">out there who will quietly teach the</text>
  <text start="2654.25" dur="2.73">kids the phonics even though</text>
  <text start="2655.48" dur="3.95">pretending to follow the common core</text>
  <text start="2656.98" dur="5.22">standards which mandate sight words and</text>
  <text start="2659.43" dur="4.54">so you know there&amp;#39;s still a lot of</text>
  <text start="2662.2" dur="4.02">reasons to be optimistic but we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2663.97" dur="3.33">just you know sit back and you know the</text>
  <text start="2666.22" dur="3.42">people watching this we need to</text>
  <text start="2667.3" dur="4.2">recognize it we have a responsibility as</text>
  <text start="2669.64" dur="4.83">individuals to go ahead and make sure</text>
  <text start="2671.5" dur="5.01">that we&amp;#39;re involved in this battle</text>
  <text start="2674.47" dur="4.139">because if we lose it you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2676.51" dur="4.29">gonna come back to your doorstep hmm</text>
  <text start="2678.609" dur="3.541">yeah and if we if not ours then</text>
  <text start="2680.8" dur="2.85">definitely that of our children and the</text>
  <text start="2682.15" dur="4.25">next generation they will they&amp;#39;ll all</text>
  <text start="2683.65" dur="5.7">endure slavery if we don&amp;#39;t stop this now</text>
  <text start="2686.4" dur="4.9">right and we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve touched on a lot</text>
  <text start="2689.35" dur="3.33">of different topics but what is some</text>
  <text start="2691.3" dur="3.18">advice that you might have for people</text>
  <text start="2692.68" dur="3.03">who are curious about this and maybe</text>
  <text start="2694.48" dur="2.28">they don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s for them or they</text>
  <text start="2695.71" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t know if they can afford it or</text>
  <text start="2696.76" dur="6.84">whatever you know just practical steps</text>
  <text start="2700.21" dur="4.74">to take to learn more about it well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2703.6" dur="3.24">glad you asked that because you know</text>
  <text start="2704.95" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s one of the biggest things that I</text>
  <text start="2706.84" dur="3.39">hear but well I can&amp;#39;t possibly</text>
  <text start="2708.34" dur="3.42">homeschool and then you have you know</text>
  <text start="2710.23" dur="3.36">the standard excuses well we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="2711.76" dur="3.24">enough money sure you do right I mean I</text>
  <text start="2713.59" dur="3.57">would homeschool if I had to live in a</text>
  <text start="2715" dur="4.859">cardboard box okay so yes you have</text>
  <text start="2717.16" dur="4.47">enough money maybe you have two cars and</text>
  <text start="2719.859" dur="4.051">maybe you don&amp;#39;t need them both maybe you</text>
  <text start="2721.63" dur="3.989">take a yearly two-week vacation to some</text>
  <text start="2723.91" dur="4.8">resort somewhere maybe you don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="2725.619" dur="5.311">do that I know there&amp;#39;s all kinds of ways</text>
  <text start="2728.71" dur="5.61">where you can save money and the way the</text>
  <text start="2730.93" dur="5.79">tax structure is designed oftentimes you</text>
  <text start="2734.32" dur="4.47">know having one parent at home almost</text>
  <text start="2736.72" dur="3.45">works out just as well financially right</text>
  <text start="2738.79" dur="3.51">you don&amp;#39;t want to pay for babysitters</text>
  <text start="2740.17" dur="4.59">you don&amp;#39;t have to hire people to do</text>
  <text start="2742.3" dur="4.26">whatever so you know you can find the</text>
  <text start="2744.76" dur="3.96">money if you have a priority that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2746.56" dur="4.02">above you know the well-being of your</text>
  <text start="2748.72" dur="3.81">kids you need to check your priorities</text>
  <text start="2750.58" dur="3.81">and realize that your children need to</text>
  <text start="2752.53" dur="3.78">be at the top of your priority list even</text>
  <text start="2754.39" dur="4.02">if that means making sacrifices and</text>
  <text start="2756.31" dur="4.74">homeschooling is a sacrifice it is work</text>
  <text start="2758.41" dur="4.29">but if your children aren&amp;#39;t worth it you</text>
  <text start="2761.05" dur="3.96">know what is worth it it&amp;#39;s a vacation</text>
  <text start="2762.7" dur="4.02">worth it is a fancy car worth it</text>
  <text start="2765.01" dur="3.359">you know get check your priorities and</text>
  <text start="2766.72" dur="4.55">the second thing I&amp;#39;d like to say is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2768.369" dur="4.801">a lot easier than it sounds right</text>
  <text start="2771.27" dur="3.55">homeschooling is not some kind of</text>
  <text start="2773.17" dur="3.39">science that you have to do exactly</text>
  <text start="2774.82" dur="3.35">right or you&amp;#39;re gonna risk messing up</text>
  <text start="2776.56" dur="3.05">your kids and I said earlier</text>
  <text start="2778.17" dur="2.85">you couldn&amp;#39;t do any worse than the</text>
  <text start="2779.61" dur="3.51">government school system even if you set</text>
  <text start="2781.02" dur="4.11">out to try they&amp;#39;ve had a hundred years</text>
  <text start="2783.12" dur="5.55">to perfect the system that is designed</text>
  <text start="2785.13" dur="6.99">to harm your kids and designed to make</text>
  <text start="2788.67" dur="6.27">them pliant and dumb down and emotional</text>
  <text start="2792.12" dur="4.98">and unable to reason so you almost</text>
  <text start="2794.94" dur="3.33">couldn&amp;#39;t do any worse right there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2797.1" dur="2.82">lot of tools out there now a</text>

  <text start="2846.72" dur="3.63">thinkers of our time who helped make</text>
  <text start="2848.7" dur="4.65">this curriculum it&amp;#39;s a great resource</text>
  <text start="2850.35" dur="4.29">you have online schools now popping up</text>
  <text start="2853.35" dur="3.21">thinking that can help you as a</text>
  <text start="2854.64" dur="3.42">supplement or that can really take over</text>
  <text start="2856.56" dur="3">for you if you want as long as you</text>

  <text start="2865.11" dur="5.01">data go to the national home education</text>
  <text start="2868.02" dur="3.63">Research Institute and what you&amp;#39;ll find</text>
  <text start="2870.12" dur="2.94">is that you know even parents who</text>
  <text start="2871.65" dur="3.12">dropped out of high school even parents</text>
  <text start="2873.06" dur="4.29">we don&amp;#39;t know Mike&amp;#39;s themselves will</text>
  <text start="2874.77" dur="4.17">still do better home schooling their</text>
  <text start="2877.35" dur="3.45">kids than they would do by putting their</text>
  <text start="2878.94" dur="3.66">kids into a government school so have</text>
  <text start="2880.8" dur="3.63">confidence in yourself yeah it&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="2882.6" dur="4.56">some sacrifice but I&amp;#39;ll also tell you</text>
  <text start="2884.43" dur="5.88">there is nothing more fun I mean I just</text>
  <text start="2887.16" dur="4.53">I can&amp;#39;t even begin to tell parents out</text>
  <text start="2890.31" dur="4.02">there how much fun it is to home-school</text>
  <text start="2891.69" dur="5.28">how much freedom you have how much joy</text>
  <text start="2894.33" dur="5.22">you get how much closer you become as a</text>
  <text start="2896.97" dur="4.98">family the bonding just it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2899.55" dur="3.93">undescribable right there&amp;#39;s no way you</text>
  <text start="2901.95" dur="3">could get that sending your kids off to</text>
  <text start="2903.48" dur="3">the government to be brainwashed for</text>
  <text start="2904.95" dur="3.81">eight hours a day for 12 years there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2906.48" dur="3.849">no way so um you know parents out and</text>
  <text start="2908.76" dur="3.819">you know if you&amp;#39;re still if you hear all</text>
  <text start="2910.329" dur="4.02">say what&amp;#39;s not for me I can&amp;#39;t do it find</text>
  <text start="2912.579" dur="3.061">out what local private schools are</text>
  <text start="2914.349" dur="4.77">available in your area or what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2915.64" dur="5.639">available online because you know as far</text>
  <text start="2919.119" dur="4.56">as I&amp;#39;m concerned you wouldn&amp;#39;t send your</text>
  <text start="2921.279" dur="3.81">kid into a burning building right</text>
  <text start="2923.679" dur="4.5">because the kid would be physically hurt</text>
  <text start="2925.089" dur="5.13">so for me if you send your kids into the</text>
  <text start="2928.179" dur="3.69">government school you&amp;#39;re doing the same</text>
  <text start="2930.219" dur="3.33">thing except you&amp;#39;re also risking their</text>
  <text start="2931.869" dur="3.39">mental well-being their spiritual</text>

  <text start="3153.18" dur="3.18">you want for your kids right you give</text>
  <text start="3154.89" dur="3.87">them a better future give them a leg up</text>
  <text start="3156.36" dur="4.53">and and have fun while doing it right I</text>
  <text start="3158.76" dur="3.9">know I literally I talk about it as</text>
  <text start="3160.89" dur="3.42">sacrifice and it is in some ways you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="3162.66" dur="4.41">have less money and maybe a little bit</text>
  <text start="3164.31" dur="4.47">less free time but the the benefits the</text>
  <text start="3167.07" dur="3.15">joys that it brings are just</text>
  <text start="3168.78" dur="4.23">immeasurable right you can&amp;#39;t put a price</text>
  <text start="3170.22" dur="4.29">on that and so you know if people want</text>
  <text start="3173.01" dur="3">to learn more I really encourage them to</text>
  <text start="3174.51" dur="2.58">go do the research and see for</text>
  <text start="3176.01" dur="4.08">themselves try it out</text>
  <text start="3177.09" dur="5.07">for yourself and fun it is yeah and I</text>
  <text start="3180.09" dur="3.33">you know before we go I want to add you</text>
  <text start="3182.16" dur="3.51">had mentioned the Ron Paul curriculum</text>
  <text start="3183.42" dur="4.23">and I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s others out there I</text>
  <text start="3185.67" dur="3.48">was actually looking into that one for</text>
  <text start="3187.65" dur="4.5">my family at one point and I really</text>
  <text start="3189.15" dur="6.09">liked that they kind of handle most of</text>
  <text start="3192.15" dur="4.56">the education the kid largely interacts</text>
  <text start="3195.24" dur="2.91">with other children on the forums things</text>
  <text start="3196.71" dur="3.45">like that they&amp;#39;re kind of it&amp;#39;s a self</text>
  <text start="3198.15" dur="4.41">teaching education it&amp;#39;s not something</text>
  <text start="3200.16" dur="4.47">that you have to be there and know all</text>
  <text start="3202.56" dur="4.62">of the curriculum or even plan the</text>
  <text start="3204.63" dur="3.48">curriculum UNK you said you I think you</text>
  <text start="3207.18" dur="3.42">just have to make sure they do the</text>
  <text start="3208.11" dur="3.99">written tests and stuff like that but so</text>
  <text start="3210.6" dur="3.21">that you can be a little bit lazy and</text>
  <text start="3212.1" dur="3.54">still get you know philosophy all these</text>
  <text start="3213.81" dur="4.17">things covered that you may not</text>
  <text start="3215.64" dur="5.04">necessarily have the time or or the</text>
  <text start="3217.98" dur="4.11">knowledge to teach so there are great</text>
  <text start="3220.68" dur="3.33">options out there and compared to the</text>
  <text start="3222.09" dur="3.65">public education system as as we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3224.01" dur="4.32">talked about this entire video it is</text>
  <text start="3225.74" dur="5.26">phenomenally better and probably a lot</text>
  <text start="3228.33" dur="4.74">cheaper at least for society as a whole</text>
  <text start="3231" dur="3.96">oh yeah absolutely you know you know on</text>
  <text start="3233.07" dur="4.17">that note too you know we we&amp;#39;re involved</text>
  <text start="3234.96" dur="3.51">in some coops right code you know for</text>
  <text start="3237.24" dur="2.91">parents who think is that the whole</text>
  <text start="3238.47" dur="3.6">burden of their kids education is gonna</text>
  <text start="3240.15" dur="4.05">be on your shoulders it&amp;#39;s not it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3242.07" dur="3.75">have to be that way right get him clear</text>
  <text start="3244.2" dur="3.69">involved with two coops and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3245.82" dur="3.72">probably ten just in our local little</text>
  <text start="3247.89" dur="4.53">area of the world we stay one more in</text>
  <text start="3249.54" dur="5.97">the United States and you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3252.42" dur="4.74">one of them you have so one mom is good</text>
  <text start="3255.51" dur="2.79">at one particular thing one dad is good</text>
  <text start="3257.16" dur="2.43">at one particular thing so we have kind</text>
  <text start="3258.3" dur="2.52">of like classrooms and we just kind of</text>
  <text start="3259.59" dur="3.24">teach each other&amp;#39;s kids</text>
  <text start="3260.82" dur="4.35">no one mom knows Spanish as she teaches</text>
  <text start="3262.83" dur="4.25">Spanish one day no science because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3265.17" dur="4.02">a scientist so he teaches science and</text>
  <text start="3267.08" dur="3.82">you know it&amp;#39;s just a great experience</text>
  <text start="3269.19" dur="3.63">and it really takes some of the burden</text>
  <text start="3270.9" dur="3.87">off the parents plus it gives the kids</text>
  <text start="3272.82" dur="4.02">an opportunity to socialize with other</text>
  <text start="3274.77" dur="3.93">kids and then there&amp;#39;s other ones that</text>
  <text start="3276.84" dur="3.81">are more you know formal and structured</text>
  <text start="3278.7" dur="3.81">like classical conversations is another</text>
  <text start="3280.65" dur="4.29">one that we&amp;#39;re involved in that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="3282.51" dur="4.35">where they actually pay the moms in some</text>
  <text start="3284.94" dur="3.24">cases dads I guess who serve as kind of</text>
  <text start="3286.86" dur="3.06">like formal tutors and you have in</text>
  <text start="3288.18" dur="3.09">classrooms with kids and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3289.92" dur="2.82">rigorous thing and they come together</text>
  <text start="3291.27" dur="3.36">once a week and the rest of the week you</text>
  <text start="3292.74" dur="3.81">do stuff on your own so all these</text>
  <text start="3294.63" dur="3.96">different support mechanisms and you</text>
  <text start="3296.55" dur="3.3">know we&amp;#39;re very blessed as Americans so</text>
  <text start="3298.59" dur="2.67">you know people have already fought</text>
  <text start="3299.85" dur="3.69">these battles for us right so now our</text>
  <text start="3301.26" dur="4.86">freedoms at least for the time being are</text>
  <text start="3303.54" dur="4.29">guaranteed in statute and court rulings</text>
  <text start="3306.12" dur="2.85">right so there&amp;#39;s no threat right now to</text>
  <text start="3307.83" dur="2.759">home schoolers that the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3308.97" dur="4.109">gonna come after you you know that</text>
  <text start="3310.589" dur="4.351">comes down the line I&amp;#39;m sure and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3313.079" dur="3.601">a lot of support and a lot of resources</text>
  <text start="3314.94" dur="2.789">there for anybody who wants to try it so</text>
  <text start="3316.68" dur="3.27">you don&amp;#39;t need to feel like you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="3317.729" dur="3.3">off into the unknown on your own and</text>
  <text start="3319.95" dur="2.46">that the whole burden for your</text>
  <text start="3321.029" dur="2.97">children&amp;#39;s future is just on your</text>
  <text start="3322.41" dur="4.139">shoulders it&amp;#39;s just really not the case</text>
  <text start="3323.999" dur="4.681">it&amp;#39;s gone way beyond that now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3326.549" dur="4.2">very much plug in and it&amp;#39;s all ready for</text>
  <text start="3328.68" dur="5.24">you you just have to kind of make your</text>
  <text start="3330.749" dur="7.891">selections like go into a restaurant and</text>
  <text start="3333.92" dur="6.189">so you know I would say that it kind of</text>
  <text start="3338.64" dur="4.53">stands to reason like you were talking</text>
  <text start="3340.109" dur="4.62">with a co-op they&amp;#39;re getting everyone in</text>

  <text start="3456.169" dur="3.15">education she said I&amp;#39;m not signing off</text>
  <text start="3458.089" dur="2.91">on this you&amp;#39;re taking out all the great</text>
  <text start="3459.319" dur="3.45">literature you&amp;#39;re reducing the critical</text>
  <text start="3460.999" dur="4.35">thinking abilities of children I mean</text>
