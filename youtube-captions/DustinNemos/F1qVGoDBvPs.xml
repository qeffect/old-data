  <text start="143.14" dur="4.29">officials threatened to release weiners</text>
  <text start="145" dur="6.99">laptop evidence exposing Clinton&amp;#39;s if</text>
  <text start="147.43" dur="8.73">indicted now what&amp;#39;s being claimed here</text>
  <text start="151.99" dur="7.68">by current high-ranking FBI officials is</text>
  <text start="156.16" dur="7.35">that former high ranking FBI officials</text>
  <text start="159.67" dur="6.87">may be avoiding prison time by</text>
  <text start="163.51" dur="5.75">holding the weiner laptop evidence</text>
  <text start="166.54" dur="6.24">hostage hanging it over people&amp;#39;s heads</text>
  <text start="169.26" dur="7.869">now we know at this point the Anthony</text>
  <text start="172.78" dur="7.92">Weiner was convicted of exchanging</text>
  <text start="177.129" dur="7.11">sexual messages sexual images with an</text>
  <text start="180.7" dur="7.319">underage girl and then also what was</text>
  <text start="184.239" dur="6">found on that laptop implied that the</text>
  <text start="188.019" dur="6.121">Clinton Foundation was involved in</text>
  <text start="190.239" dur="6.991">crimes against children and also there</text>
  <text start="194.14" dur="7.349">is a rumor going around that there was a</text>
  <text start="197.23" dur="8.849">video of Hillary Clinton with Huma</text>
  <text start="201.489" dur="10.351">Abedin doing some unspeakable act to a</text>
  <text start="206.079" dur="8.761">child and that a few NYPD officers had</text>
  <text start="211.84" dur="4.069">viewed that video and that it had made</text>
  <text start="214.84" dur="5.67">them sick</text>
  <text start="215.909" dur="7.631">now also allegedly the NYPD officers who</text>
  <text start="220.51" dur="6.449">had viewed this video had wanted to come</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="6.87">forward with that evidence however it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.959" dur="6.541">alleged that Loretta Lynch had come down</text>
  <text start="230.41" dur="5.88">on the NYPD at that time and of course</text>
  <text start="233.5" dur="6.15">this was also around the same time that</text>
  <text start="236.29" dur="7.11">the tarmac had happened as well so there</text>
  <text start="239.65" dur="8.76">were a lot of things going on now also</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="10.519">we know that one of those officers is no</text>
  <text start="248.41" dur="8.789">longer with us by alleged suicide and</text>
  <text start="253.919" dur="6.841">those of us who follow along with the</text>
  <text start="257.199" dur="7.351">Clinton crime family story know that</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="6.219">this alleged suicide is likely part of</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="3.06">the hashtag Clinton body count at this</text>
  <text start="266.979" dur="4.921">point</text>
  <text start="267.61" dur="7.44">so because seemingly your suicide risk</text>
  <text start="271.9" dur="7.199">is much higher if you are associated</text>
  <text start="275.05" dur="11.78">with any knowledge of the Clinton crime</text>
  <text start="279.099" dur="12.391">activities at all now I&amp;#39;m not sure</text>
  <text start="286.83" dur="7.99">whether or not this is true where the</text>
  <text start="291.49" dur="5.03">FBI well the former FBI officials are</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="6.68">holding this over their head</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="8.13">if we have a cleaned-up Justice</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="6.81">Department if we supposedly have a</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="11.13">cleaned-up FBI then why on earth would</text>
  <text start="308.31" dur="11.28">this even matter charge them all this</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="9.69">should not even be allowed to be used as</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="8.85">leverage to get out of jail in fact the</text>
  <text start="325.47" dur="5.31">FBI the former FBI officials who are</text>
  <text start="328.44" dur="4.62">guilty of a crime and need to go to</text>
  <text start="330.78" dur="5.37">prison need to go to prison for those</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="6.599">crimes and then the evidence from the</text>
  <text start="336.15" dur="6.63">Weiner laptop needs to be used in order</text>
  <text start="339.659" dur="6.781">to put Clinton and Huma Abedin who is</text>
  <text start="342.78" dur="9.27">allegedly in this video they all need to</text>
  <text start="346.44" dur="8.099">go to prison so really we need to be</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="5.16">asking ourselves if this is really true</text>
  <text start="354.539" dur="7.951">then what is going on with our Justice</text>
  <text start="357.21" dur="6.019">Department why aren&amp;#39;t these people in</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="5.97">jail</text>
  <text start="363.229" dur="13.75">Christopher Rea why this should not even</text>
  <text start="368.46" dur="9.139">be allowed put them all in jail end of</text>
  <text start="376.979" dur="4.231">story</text>
  <text start="377.599" dur="6.611">in other news the American Civil</text>
  <text start="381.21" dur="5.1">Liberties Union had recently filed a</text>
  <text start="384.21" dur="6.949">lawsuit against the third country rule</text>
  <text start="386.31" dur="7.8">which states that a person who is</text>
  <text start="391.159" dur="5.741">wanting to claim asylum needs to claim</text>
  <text start="394.11" dur="7.44">asylum in the first safe country they</text>
  <text start="396.9" dur="7.71">reach so in other words people coming</text>
  <text start="401.55" dur="6.869">from Central America or Africa or the</text>
  <text start="404.61" dur="6.059">Middle East cannot claim make their</text>
  <text start="408.419" dur="6.15">first claim for asylum in the United</text>
  <text start="410.669" dur="7.081">States so for example those coming from</text>
  <text start="414.569" dur="6.331">Central America would likely file for</text>
  <text start="417.75" dur="5.46">asylum in Mexico so they would not be</text>
  <text start="420.9" dur="4.139">eligible to claim asylum in the United</text>
  <text start="423.21" dur="3.87">States which makes sense because if</text>
  <text start="425.039" dur="5.111">you&amp;#39;re coming from Central America and</text>
  <text start="427.08" dur="5.23">you&amp;#39;re traveling all that long way</text>
  <text start="430.15" dur="3.66">all the way up through Mexico to get to</text>
  <text start="432.31" dur="5.13">the southern border of the United States</text>
  <text start="433.81" dur="7.41">you have placed yourself intentionally</text>
  <text start="437.44" dur="7.28">in danger on that journey so therefore</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="6.36">your claim for asylum is null and void</text>
  <text start="444.72" dur="7.42">because you wittingly put yourself in</text>
  <text start="447.58" dur="8.48">danger now the American Civil Liberties</text>
  <text start="452.14" dur="7.35">Union had filed a lawsuit against it and</text>
  <text start="456.06" dur="5.41">the federal appeals court had ruled on</text>
  <text start="459.49" dur="3.98">Friday that the Trump administration can</text>
  <text start="461.47" dur="5.49">go ahead and move forward with that rule</text>
  <text start="463.47" dur="4.63">with the exception of California and</text>
  <text start="466.96" dur="3.51">Arizona</text>
  <text start="468.1" dur="6.87">now the busiest areas for asylum seekers</text>
  <text start="470.47" dur="6.24">has been Texas as well as New Mexico now</text>
  <text start="474.97" dur="3.9">of course the American Civil Liberties</text>
  <text start="476.71" dur="5.07">Union has said that they will continue</text>
  <text start="478.87" dur="6.69">to fight this in court and until they</text>
  <text start="481.78" dur="7.98">see that asylum seekers do not have to</text>
  <text start="485.56" dur="7.02">face this third country rule so we will</text>
  <text start="489.76" dur="5">continue to follow this to see where</text>
  <text start="492.58" dur="6.39">this goes I&amp;#39;m hoping that at some point</text>
  <text start="494.76" dur="7.75">they will extend this rule to apply also</text>
  <text start="498.97" dur="6.69">to California as well as Arizona because</text>
  <text start="502.51" dur="5.49">even though Texas and New Mexico have</text>
  <text start="505.66" dur="3.96">been the busiest areas for asylum</text>
  <text start="508" dur="4.5">seekers that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that after</text>
  <text start="509.62" dur="6.09">they realize that you know if they go to</text>
  <text start="512.5" dur="5.55">these places they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="515.71" dur="4.5">able to apply for asylum then they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="518.05" dur="4.41">start funneling themselves to California</text>
  <text start="520.21" dur="5.91">in Arizona where these this rule does</text>
  <text start="522.46" dur="6.62">not apply so as soon as they figure out</text>
  <text start="526.12" dur="6.6">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to happen so</text>
  <text start="529.08" dur="7.96">people need to continue to work in order</text>
  <text start="532.72" dur="6.42">to ensure that this rule is also applied</text>
  <text start="537.04" dur="7.32">to California in Arizona that applies to</text>
  <text start="539.14" dur="8.01">the entire border now an update on the</text>
  <text start="544.36" dur="6.14">second amendment fight so in California</text>
  <text start="547.15" dur="8.12">there is a gun rights group that is</text>
  <text start="550.5" dur="7.63">suing the state to prevent them from</text>
  <text start="555.27" dur="7.39">enforcing a recent ban on assault</text>
  <text start="558.13" dur="5.31">weapons so they have opened up this case</text>
  <text start="562.66" dur="2.91">in</text>
  <text start="563.44" dur="8.16">San Diego which is the same district</text>
  <text start="565.57" dur="9.12">that ruled against a ban that California</text>
  <text start="571.6" dur="5.85">tried to place on ammunition magazines</text>
  <text start="574.69" dur="4.71">carrying more than ten bullets so this</text>
  <text start="577.45" dur="4.32">is a good thing because it means that</text>
  <text start="579.4" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s likely that the court is going to</text>
  <text start="581.77" dur="5.34">rule in their favor and that the assault</text>
  <text start="584.59" dur="4.17">weapons ban will not be enforced which</text>
  <text start="587.11" dur="5.16">is a good thing now we know here in</text>
  <text start="588.76" dur="6.96">Florida Ashlee moody is currently trying</text>
  <text start="592.27" dur="7.94">to fight against the proposal for an</text>
  <text start="595.72" dur="8.67">amendment to the Constitution that says</text>
  <text start="600.21" dur="8.2">assault weapons should be banned and</text>
  <text start="604.39" dur="5.85">that it should limit semi-automatic long</text>
  <text start="608.41" dur="3.99">guns now</text>
  <text start="610.24" dur="4.68">Ashlee moody has said that the language</text>
  <text start="612.4" dur="6.59">in this amendment in this proposed</text>
  <text start="614.92" dur="7.56">amendment would virtually eliminate all</text>
  <text start="618.99" dur="6.12">long guns so then of course the next</text>
  <text start="622.48" dur="6.21">step would be pistols and handguns so</text>
  <text start="625.11" dur="6.34">really again they&amp;#39;re trying to little by</text>
  <text start="628.69" dur="5">little encroach on the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="631.45" dur="5.97">and so it&amp;#39;s a good thing that we have</text>
  <text start="633.69" dur="6.07">Ashlee moody fighting for this as well</text>
  <text start="637.42" dur="5.79">as this gun rights group in California</text>
  <text start="639.76" dur="7.68">so this is a good thing and we should</text>
  <text start="643.21" dur="6.45">not rest on this issue in other news</text>
  <text start="647.44" dur="4.41">Seagram&amp;#39;s air is clear Bronfman pays</text>
  <text start="649.66" dur="5.79">feds six million dollars overall and</text>
  <text start="651.85" dur="5.37">nexium so she has had to pay this amount</text>
  <text start="655.45" dur="6.54">to the federal government for pleading</text>
  <text start="657.22" dur="8.13">guilty to harboring an illegal alien for</text>
  <text start="661.99" dur="7.26">financial gain now really what that</text>
  <text start="665.35" dur="8.22">should say is that she had kidnapped and</text>
  <text start="669.25" dur="7.8">was holding hostage a sex trafficking</text>
  <text start="673.57" dur="5.82">victim from another country that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="677.05" dur="5.039">really what her crime should state</text>
  <text start="679.39" dur="4.62">because that&amp;#39;s what it was also in</text>
  <text start="682.089" dur="4.531">addition of the six million dollars that</text>
  <text start="684.01" dur="4.29">she&amp;#39;s had to pay as part of a debt to</text>
  <text start="686.62" dur="4.31">the federal government in relation to</text>
  <text start="688.3" dur="5.269">that crime she&amp;#39;s also put up</text>
  <text start="690.93" dur="5.269">fourteen million dollars as a defense</text>
  <text start="693.569" dur="6.21">fund for her Co defendants including</text>
  <text start="696.199" dur="6.521">aliceandmac now an interesting fact</text>
  <text start="699.779" dur="5.49">about Claire Brockman and again we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="702.72" dur="6.39">gonna talk a little bit today about how</text>
  <text start="705.269" dur="7.521">all of these people are connected in a</text>
  <text start="709.11" dur="6.419">network that has existed for decades</text>
  <text start="712.79" dur="6.07">these are not separate issues the</text>
  <text start="715.529" dur="6.511">Epstein case the nexium case these are</text>
  <text start="718.86" dur="5.18">not separate they&amp;#39;re all part of a</text>
  <text start="722.04" dur="8.7">bigger network</text>
  <text start="724.04" dur="10.57">so Bronfman is the Seagram heiress and</text>
  <text start="730.74" dur="8.129">she&amp;#39;s related to Samuel Bronfman now</text>
  <text start="734.61" dur="8.13">Samuel Bronfman he had really rose to</text>
  <text start="738.869" dur="8.731">power during the Prohibition era and he</text>
  <text start="742.74" dur="8.449">was connected to several leaders of the</text>
  <text start="747.6" dur="7.399">criminal underworld and in fact during a</text>
  <text start="751.189" dur="9.431">Senate committee hearing over the</text>
  <text start="754.999" dur="10.9">national crime syndicates several big</text>
  <text start="760.62" dur="7.409">leaders in mafias had said that Samuel</text>
  <text start="765.899" dur="6.841">Bronfman was at the center of almost all</text>
  <text start="768.029" dur="8.43">of it now Samuel Bronfman was also</text>
  <text start="772.74" dur="9.569">connected to Lewis rosin Steele as well</text>
  <text start="776.459" dur="9.57">as Lex Wexner now Lewis rosin Steele had</text>
  <text start="782.309" dur="7.2">also been involved in some very sketchy</text>
  <text start="786.029" dur="7.261">activity and in fact his one of his</text>
  <text start="789.509" dur="8.37">ex-wives Sarah Kaufman had testified</text>
  <text start="793.29" dur="7.739">that Roz and Steele had hosted several</text>
  <text start="797.879" dur="7.83">parties elite parties and at those</text>
  <text start="801.029" dur="9.77">parties there were boy prostitutes that</text>
  <text start="805.709" dur="5.09">were offered up to the very powerful</text>
  <text start="810.86" dur="10.479">this is something that has been going on</text>
  <text start="815.939" dur="7.771">for a long time and so rosin Steele was</text>
  <text start="821.339" dur="5.071">very closely connected with Samuel Brown</text>
  <text start="823.71" dur="4.74">and they were running around in the same</text>
  <text start="826.41" dur="6">networks they were operating in the same</text>
  <text start="828.45" dur="7.14">network so it would not be far-fetched</text>
  <text start="832.41" dur="6.06">to say that Samuel Bronfman himself was</text>
  <text start="835.59" dur="7.02">also involved in the sexual exploitation</text>
  <text start="838.47" dur="8.28">of children so now we have Claire</text>
  <text start="842.61" dur="7.14">Bronfman who is involved in a they call</text>
  <text start="846.75" dur="6.51">it a sex cult but it was not really a</text>
  <text start="849.75" dur="9.06">sex cult it was a sex trafficking</text>
  <text start="853.26" dur="10.32">Network a Ponzi scheme in order to</text>
  <text start="858.81" dur="8.73">exploit the vulnerable to traffic them</text>
  <text start="863.58" dur="7.1">we have to remember that Allison Mac in</text>
  <text start="867.54" dur="9.42">her indictment she is accused of</text>
  <text start="870.68" dur="10.3">trafficking children so Claire Bronfman</text>
  <text start="876.96" dur="10.86">is involved in this this is not a</text>
  <text start="880.98" dur="14.39">coincidence now let&amp;#39;s dig in to this</text>
  <text start="887.82" dur="12.63">network a little bit further all right</text>
  <text start="895.37" dur="9.36">so Scientology right now one of their</text>
  <text start="900.45" dur="8.52">members is involved in a lawsuit where</text>
  <text start="904.73" dur="6.34">several women have accused this man and</text>
  <text start="908.97" dur="4.68">Danny Masterson who&amp;#39;s best known for his</text>
  <text start="911.07" dur="7.5">role in that 70s show they&amp;#39;re accusing</text>
  <text start="913.65" dur="7.74">him of sexual abuse now they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="918.57" dur="4.62">claiming that as soon as they brought</text>
  <text start="921.39" dur="6.9">forth this lawsuit as soon as they</text>
  <text start="923.19" dur="8.79">accuse Danny Masterson of rape all of a</text>
  <text start="928.29" dur="6.57">sudden Scientology members of</text>
  <text start="931.98" dur="6.12">Scientology were harassing them they</text>
  <text start="934.86" dur="5.13">claimed that they were followed by car</text>
  <text start="938.1" dur="4.62">and one of them was actually run off the</text>
  <text start="939.99" dur="7.47">road they claimed that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="942.72" dur="8.04">followed into libraries into stores they</text>
  <text start="947.46" dur="5.22">claimed to come out of their homes to</text>
  <text start="950.76" dur="5.43">find that the trunk of their car the</text>
  <text start="952.68" dur="4.11">door of their car is open one accuser</text>
  <text start="956.19" dur="3.21">had</text>
  <text start="956.79" dur="5.7">even said that her dog had mysteriously</text>
  <text start="959.4" dur="8.28">died and the autopsy had said that it</text>
  <text start="962.49" dur="6.87">had been strangled so they are saying</text>
  <text start="967.68" dur="4.73">that all of this started happening as</text>
  <text start="969.36" dur="6.81">soon as they accused Danny Masterson of</text>
  <text start="972.41" dur="7.33">rape now they&amp;#39;ve also said that when it</text>
  <text start="976.17" dur="9.12">comes to this case which has been open</text>
  <text start="979.74" dur="8.31">for a year they claim that the district</text>
  <text start="985.29" dur="8.85">attorney has said that all the evidence</text>
  <text start="988.05" dur="9.15">is there for to bring a case but yet he</text>
  <text start="994.14" dur="6.02">has not been charged why they say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="997.2" dur="6.69">because of Scientology that Scientology</text>
  <text start="1000.16" dur="8.14">really protects Danny Masterson and</text>
  <text start="1003.89" dur="8.04">because of the power possessed by the</text>
  <text start="1008.3" dur="7.01">leaders of Scientology that that makes</text>
  <text start="1011.93" dur="9.45">Danny Masterson practically untouchable</text>
  <text start="1015.31" dur="11.01">now allegations of sexual abuse have</text>
  <text start="1021.38" dur="9.05">circled around Scientology for years but</text>
  <text start="1026.32" dur="8.1">nothing really has been done about</text>
  <text start="1030.43" dur="6.76">holding anyone accountable anyone who is</text>
  <text start="1034.42" dur="7.9">related to Scientology they&amp;#39;re not held</text>
  <text start="1037.19" dur="9.72">accountable now also I want to mention</text>
  <text start="1042.32" dur="6.39">again here that Scientology recently has</text>
  <text start="1046.91" dur="3.99">been given a special privilege within</text>
  <text start="1048.71" dur="6.95">the United Nations so now they have</text>
  <text start="1050.9" dur="4.76">influence within the United Nations also</text>
  <text start="1055.78" dur="11.17">Scientology was founded by l ron Hubbard</text>
  <text start="1061.85" dur="8.83">an L ron Hubbard is connected to Jack</text>
  <text start="1066.95" dur="6.25">Parsons and Aleister Crowley</text>
  <text start="1070.68" dur="6.15">and so when it comes to l ron Hubbard</text>
  <text start="1073.2" dur="8.9">and Jack Parsons they&amp;#39;re connected to</text>
  <text start="1076.83" dur="5.27">jizz lane Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="1082.73" dur="9.1">so also really briefly about Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="1087" dur="7.89">Epstein Jeffrey Epstein may be the</text>
  <text start="1091.83" dur="6.48">successor to Roy Cohn who during his</text>
  <text start="1094.89" dur="7.89">time for many many years was known for</text>
  <text start="1098.31" dur="8.13">sexual blackmail and of course Roy Cohn</text>
  <text start="1102.78" dur="10.02">was connected to Samuel Grothman</text>
  <text start="1106.44" dur="10.05">as well as rosensteil seeing the network</text>
  <text start="1112.8" dur="6.9">now okay so back to l ron Hubbard and</text>
  <text start="1116.49" dur="5.85">Jack Parsons in jazz Lane Maxwell so</text>
  <text start="1119.7" dur="3.69">there was an interesting article from</text>
  <text start="1122.34" dur="4.47">The Daily Beast</text>
  <text start="1123.39" dur="6">now they go into great detail about jazz</text>
  <text start="1126.81" dur="5.61">Lane Maxwell&amp;#39;s family but they only</text>
  <text start="1129.39" dur="5.7">touch on what I find to be the most</text>
  <text start="1132.42" dur="5.64">interesting connects they only touch on</text>
  <text start="1135.09" dur="5.58">it very very very briefly so the most</text>
  <text start="1138.06" dur="6.71">interesting connect with jizz Lane</text>
  <text start="1140.67" dur="5.69">Maxwell one of them is her</text>
  <text start="1144.77" dur="5.52">brother-in-law</text>
  <text start="1146.36" dur="7.45">so her brother-in-law was the son of</text>
  <text start="1150.29" dur="6.01">Frank Moline Frank Moline was an</text>
  <text start="1153.81" dur="8.79">astrophysicist who was very closely</text>
  <text start="1156.3" dur="10.68">connected to Jack Parsons so they were</text>
  <text start="1162.6" dur="8.79">working on rocket fuel rocket propulsion</text>
  <text start="1166.98" dur="10.65">and eventually their work turned into</text>
  <text start="1171.39" dur="8.81">what NASA is today so Jack Parsons in l</text>
  <text start="1177.63" dur="6.69">ron hubbard the founder of Scientology</text>
  <text start="1180.2" dur="8.59">they had also been involved in the</text>
  <text start="1184.32" dur="7.68">occult so Jack Parsons was the number</text>
  <text start="1188.79" dur="6.69">one protege of Aleister Crowley</text>
  <text start="1192" dur="8.43">and so they were involved in sex magic</text>
  <text start="1195.48" dur="10.16">and in ritualistic abuse and that</text>
  <text start="1200.43" dur="9.54">included homosexuality pedophilia</text>
  <text start="1205.64" dur="10.03">bestiality even and so l ron Hubbard and</text>
  <text start="1209.97" dur="8.09">Jack Parsons were really trying to bring</text>
  <text start="1215.67" dur="11.25">forth the birth of the Antichrist</text>
  <text start="1218.06" dur="13.39">through sexual rituals these are the</text>
  <text start="1226.92" dur="8.85">occult figures who are at the origins of</text>
  <text start="1231.45" dur="9.6">these sexual networks these elite</text>
  <text start="1235.77" dur="8.25">networks that use the sexual abuse the</text>
  <text start="1241.05" dur="6.75">sexual exploitation of others especially</text>
  <text start="1244.02" dur="6.56">children in order to gain power the</text>
  <text start="1247.8" dur="5.01">other interesting person within her</text>
  <text start="1250.58" dur="5.53">family background was her other</text>
  <text start="1252.81" dur="5.19">brother-in-law al suckle so al suckle</text>
  <text start="1256.11" dur="4.29">who was an illusionist and he made a</text>
  <text start="1258" dur="5.28">career out of being an illusionist his</text>
  <text start="1260.4" dur="4.74">daughter Elizabeth had also extended on</text>
  <text start="1263.28" dur="4.83">his work and had created mirror box</text>
  <text start="1265.14" dur="7.41">therapy and then al cecal had apparently</text>
  <text start="1268.11" dur="9.03">took that mirror box therapy and went to</text>
  <text start="1272.55" dur="8.01">Haiti supposedly to work with amputees</text>
  <text start="1277.14" dur="5.07">after the earthquake and of course he</text>
  <text start="1280.56" dur="5.55">was working with the Clinton Global</text>
  <text start="1282.21" dur="5.97">Initiative on this so at this point</text>
  <text start="1286.11" dur="5.28">again those of us who are following</text>
  <text start="1288.18" dur="7.47">along with the Clinton crime family</text>
  <text start="1291.39" dur="9.98">activities we understand that the</text>
  <text start="1295.65" dur="10.35">Clinton Global Initiative is a cover and</text>
  <text start="1301.37" dur="7.06">so they go to these different places to</text>
  <text start="1306" dur="5.34">do quote-unquote philanthropy work but</text>
  <text start="1308.43" dur="7.86">really they&amp;#39;re not really they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1311.34" dur="10.97">involved in exploitation of areas that</text>
  <text start="1316.29" dur="8.25">are rife with conflict or poverty or</text>
  <text start="1322.31" dur="3.16">really anything that makes them</text>
  <text start="1324.54" dur="6.06">vulnerable</text>
  <text start="1325.47" dur="10.38">so in the case of Haiti there was a lot</text>
  <text start="1330.6" dur="7.799">of sex trafficking going on there and a</text>
  <text start="1335.85" dur="6.079">spotlight was put on this briefly even</text>
  <text start="1338.399" dur="7.681">in the mainstream media when Laura</text>
  <text start="1341.929" dur="5.821">Silsbee who was connected to Hillary</text>
  <text start="1346.08" dur="4.349">Clinton</text>
  <text start="1347.75" dur="9.309">Laura Silsbee was caught trying to</text>
  <text start="1350.429" dur="12.48">traffic 30 children out of Haiti who</text>
  <text start="1357.059" dur="7.891">were not orphans so what exactly was he</text>
  <text start="1362.909" dur="6">doing there what was cecal doing there</text>
  <text start="1364.95" dur="9.66">it was likely not helping amputees using</text>
  <text start="1368.909" dur="8.791">mirror box therapy and also he is said</text>
  <text start="1374.61" dur="7.22">to have hosted a scientific conference</text>
  <text start="1377.7" dur="7.77">at Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s private islands</text>
  <text start="1381.83" dur="7.62">even though they say that no illicit</text>
  <text start="1385.47" dur="8.61">activity had gone on there yeah right</text>
  <text start="1389.45" dur="7.209">now I also found this interesting</text>
  <text start="1394.08" dur="5.79">article on Lincoln Park</text>
  <text start="1396.659" dur="5.37">so it&amp;#39;s digging this back up again so</text>
  <text start="1399.87" dur="3.809">this is from metalhead zone it says</text>
  <text start="1402.029" dur="3.78">Linkin Park fans reveal unique</text>
  <text start="1403.679" dur="5.58">conspiracy theories about Chester</text>
  <text start="1405.809" dur="6.33">binnington&amp;#39;s death now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1409.259" dur="6.17">talking about here is this picture that</text>
  <text start="1412.139" dur="7.831">was recently posted by his sister and</text>
  <text start="1415.429" dur="7.061">the quote that she had placed underneath</text>
  <text start="1419.97" dur="4.589">it that&amp;#39;s what sparked this conversation</text>
  <text start="1422.49" dur="4.59">again so she says is it a coincidence</text>
  <text start="1424.559" dur="4.681">that all these people died by hanging</text>
  <text start="1427.08" dur="5.13">themselves I&amp;#39;m beginning to wonder just</text>
  <text start="1429.24" dur="5.61">how deep this hashtag epstein debacle</text>
  <text start="1432.21" dur="4.65">goes how many more will die by suicide</text>
  <text start="1434.85" dur="4.709">before the authorities take this</text>
  <text start="1436.86" dur="5.819">seriously hashtag Bill Clinton body</text>
  <text start="1439.559" dur="5.7">count okay so it&amp;#39;s interesting that</text>
  <text start="1442.679" dur="4.051">she&amp;#39;s talking about whether or not</text>
  <text start="1445.259" dur="4.461">Epstein killed himself</text>
  <text start="1446.73" dur="5.88">and she&amp;#39;s posting a picture of her and</text>
  <text start="1449.72" dur="6.39">Chester Bennington her brother who</text>
  <text start="1452.61" dur="3.5">allegedly killed himself</text>
  <text start="1456.52" dur="5.92">now here&amp;#39;s the thing about chester</text>
  <text start="1459.23" dur="5.97">bennington most people who are not aware</text>
  <text start="1462.44" dur="5.4">of this would not even think about there</text>
  <text start="1465.2" dur="7.83">being a link between chester bennington</text>
  <text start="1467.84" dur="6.72">and the Clintons however it turns out</text>
  <text start="1473.03" dur="4.68">that chester bennington</text>
  <text start="1474.56" dur="6.81">was involved on a project that was</text>
  <text start="1477.71" dur="6.51">headed by Chris Cornell and so Chris</text>
  <text start="1481.37" dur="6.15">Cornell was funding a documentary called</text>
  <text start="1484.22" dur="7.47">the silent children so let me show you</text>
  <text start="1487.52" dur="7.38">this really quick so this was a website</text>
  <text start="1491.69" dur="6.39">for the documentary that actually never</text>
  <text start="1494.9" dur="5.46">finished because Chris Cornell killed</text>
  <text start="1498.08" dur="6.18">himself and then chester bennington</text>
  <text start="1500.36" dur="5.61">ended up dying not long after that also</text>
  <text start="1504.26" dur="4.05">by alleged suicide</text>
  <text start="1505.97" dur="5.22">so the silent children is a documentary</text>
  <text start="1508.31" dur="5.97">about sex trafficking of children now</text>
  <text start="1511.19" dur="5.4">when you look at the story outline here</text>
  <text start="1514.28" dur="3.72">it says our story will be told through</text>
  <text start="1516.59" dur="3.54">several different windows into the</text>
  <text start="1518" dur="4.08">subject matter our visual narrative will</text>
  <text start="1520.13" dur="4.14">be drawn from among the type of examples</text>
  <text start="1522.08" dur="4.2">below as the project&amp;#39;s research to</text>
  <text start="1524.27" dur="3.81">develop specific storylines might change</text>
  <text start="1526.28" dur="4.14">as situations are presented to the</text>
  <text start="1528.08" dur="4.11">filmmakers the documentary form offers</text>
  <text start="1530.42" dur="4.89">fluid opportunity for discovery and</text>
  <text start="1532.19" dur="5.46">revelation our overview will be provided</text>
  <text start="1535.31" dur="4.53">by Paul Myhill Paul will take us through</text>
  <text start="1537.65" dur="4.98">his extensive personal field experiences</text>
  <text start="1539.84" dur="4.74">in over 60 countries including recent</text>
  <text start="1542.63" dur="4.77">work in Haiti and Southeast Asia</text>
  <text start="1544.58" dur="5.46">Southeast Asia the golden triangle we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1547.4" dur="4.74">been talking about this for a while now</text>
  <text start="1550.04" dur="3.96">I have been talking about this and</text>
  <text start="1552.14" dur="6.57">talking about this the golden triangle</text>
  <text start="1554" dur="7.08">is a hub for sex trafficking also Haiti</text>
  <text start="1558.71" dur="5.58">and we know that the Clintons were</text>
  <text start="1561.08" dur="7.08">involved in sex trafficking there so</text>
  <text start="1564.29" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s interesting that this documentary</text>
  <text start="1568.16" dur="5.19">was cancelled right after Chris</text>
  <text start="1569.93" dur="5.88">Cornell&amp;#39;s death that apparently this</text>
  <text start="1573.35" dur="5.25">documentary was investigating several</text>
  <text start="1575.81" dur="5.88">hubs for sex trafficking including Haiti</text>
  <text start="1578.6" dur="5.51">which is very closely linked with the</text>
  <text start="1581.69" dur="2.42">Clintons</text>
  <text start="1585.09" dur="9.13">so we have all of these people that are</text>
  <text start="1590.559" dur="7.591">connected it&amp;#39;s showing a network so</text>
  <text start="1594.22" dur="6.3">again we have chiselin maxwell who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1598.15" dur="4.68">connected with epsteen epsteen was</text>

  <text start="1602.83" dur="8.16">with les Wexner as well as rosensteil</text>
  <text start="1607.6" dur="6.24">and Samuel Bronfman and of course Claire</text>
  <text start="1610.99" dur="8.61">Bronfman who is involved in nexium was</text>
  <text start="1613.84" dur="8.01">related to Samuel Bronfman and of course</text>
  <text start="1619.6" dur="5.88">at the same time we can link</text>
  <text start="1621.85" dur="5.88">Jasleen Maxwell with Jack Parsons who is</text>
  <text start="1625.48" dur="5.819">linked with l ron Hubbard who is linked</text>
  <text start="1627.73" dur="6.36">with Scientology because he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1631.299" dur="11.361">founder and now we have Scientology with</text>
  <text start="1634.09" dur="8.57">an official position within the UN so</text>
  <text start="1642.72" dur="13.199">these cases are part of a larger network</text>
  <text start="1651.299" dur="4.62">that has existed for decades</text>
