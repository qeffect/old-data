  <text start="6.509" dur="8.901">solution the problem is a lot of dirty</text>
  <text start="10.08" dur="9.869">electricity small EMF RF 5 G 4G Wi-Fi</text>
  <text start="15.41" dur="6.16">smart meters all of that the solution</text>
  <text start="19.949" dur="4.651">the well the reaction is of course</text>
  <text start="21.57" dur="5.16">unhealthiness disease sickliness i mean</text>
  <text start="24.6" dur="3.689">that we just heard about this one school</text>
  <text start="26.73" dur="4.949">that had a or daycare i think that had a</text>
  <text start="28.289" dur="5.281">cell tower or some sort of antenna tower</text>
  <text start="31.679" dur="3.301">that they were getting paid a measly</text>
  <text start="33.57" dur="2.97">like two or three thousand dollars for a</text>
  <text start="34.98" dur="4.59">month and some of the kids they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="39.57" dur="5.91">so we&amp;#39;re seeing it already start to play</text>
  <text start="41.61" dur="6.179">out on society and the solution is of</text>
  <text start="45.48" dur="5.79">course at least somewhat of a solution</text>
  <text start="47.789" dur="5.641">is shown guide which is a cheap carbon</text>
  <text start="51.27" dur="4.769">material which has some interesting</text>
  <text start="53.43" dur="5.519">properties attenuating some of the</text>
  <text start="56.039" dur="4.381">harmful electrical waves and and smog</text>
  <text start="58.949" dur="4.77">that we&amp;#39;re just dealing with all the</text>
  <text start="60.42" dur="5.699">time especially with any sort of smart</text>
  <text start="63.719" dur="4.231">meter or 5g or anything like that near</text>
  <text start="66.119" dur="3.811">your body this is something that you can</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="5.07">add into paint so i want to go over just</text>
  <text start="69.93" dur="4.2">real briefly real fast one you want to</text>
  <text start="73.02" dur="2.82">make sure that you go through and learn</text>
  <text start="74.13" dur="3.629">how to test the Ashtanga authenticity</text>
  <text start="75.84" dur="4.2">make sure you&amp;#39;re getting the real stuff</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="5.671">I get mine directly from the mines in</text>
  <text start="80.04" dur="5.64">Russia and I get it in bulk secondly</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="4.14">there are some great guides out there</text>
  <text start="85.68" dur="4.619">about how it works I&amp;#39;ve done videos and</text>
  <text start="87.57" dur="4.68">covering how it works you can even get</text>
  <text start="90.299" dur="5.64">the elites young guy the shiny stuff but</text>
  <text start="92.25" dur="5.159">it does mostly come from Russia some of</text>
  <text start="95.939" dur="3.511">the interesting studies that have been</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="3.811">done for example shielding effect of</text>
  <text start="99.45" dur="4.08">mineral fungi during electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="101.22" dur="4.95">irradiation of rats skipping down here</text>
  <text start="103.53" dur="4.08">to the conclusion young guys shoulder</text>
  <text start="106.17" dur="2.699">the rats from the damaging effect of</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="2.82">microwave radiations</text>
  <text start="108.869" dur="3.421">this proves that shunga it has positive</text>
  <text start="110.43" dur="5.13">shielding effect from electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="112.29" dur="5.85">radiation so you can look up that</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="6.12">article if you&amp;#39;d like and my solution is</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="5.79">this song light powder I mixed it in</text>
  <text start="121.68" dur="3.63">with my paint at the last place I lived</text>
  <text start="123.93" dur="3.78">and I haven&amp;#39;t done it yet I just got</text>
  <text start="125.31" dur="4.71">here to the new place but you can mix</text>
  <text start="127.71" dur="4.5">some of this in with your paint it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="130.02" dur="4.41">turn a white to a grey or even</text>
  <text start="132.21" dur="4.77">lightish blue but you can always cover</text>
  <text start="134.43" dur="4.62">that again and it&amp;#39;s worth a couple of</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="3.51">extra layers even if that even if that</text>
  <text start="139.05" dur="4.22">is necessary which I&amp;#39;m not saying it</text>
  <text start="140.49" dur="6.09">will be and you may have to sort of</text>
  <text start="143.27" dur="5.17">experiment I have not done a real test</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="3.75">on this with my own meter these meters</text>
  <text start="148.44" dur="4.38">are really expensive so I don&amp;#39;t have one</text>
  <text start="150.33" dur="4.53">but I have not done a test on that with</text>
  <text start="152.82" dur="3.75">the wall like this but studies have been</text>
  <text start="154.86" dur="3.63">done showing that has some amazing</text>
  <text start="156.57" dur="3.09">properties and you can go on YouTube and</text>
  <text start="158.49" dur="3.6">look at some of the videos or like a</text>
  <text start="159.66" dur="6.03">minute or less so I mean it&amp;#39;s amazing so</text>
  <text start="162.09" dur="6.21">I chose this as a cheap solution and an</text>
  <text start="165.69" dur="4.8">excuse to do a new paint job anyway so</text>
  <text start="168.3" dur="5.82">you can get it here I&amp;#39;m selling it in</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="7.11">just little baggies of one kilogram each</text>
  <text start="174.12" dur="7.05">and that&amp;#39;s it so I will see you guys on</text>
  <text start="177.6" dur="5.43">the next one destiny most out basically</text>
  <text start="181.17" dur="3.98">this is not a perfect solution because</text>
  <text start="183.03" dur="7.35">and I forgot to add this here at the end</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="8.05">because it will not completely protect</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="5.79">you I mean for example 5g can can nuke</text>
  <text start="193.2" dur="5.28">in some sense it can mess up the oxygen</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="4.2">in the air so if you&amp;#39;re inside of a home</text>
  <text start="198.48" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s protected by Shung bite even if</text>
  <text start="200.37" dur="4.44">you&amp;#39;re 360 surrounded protected well</text>
  <text start="203.37" dur="3.06">you&amp;#39;re still gonna have that air coming</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="3.96">in to breathe right so you&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="206.43" dur="3.66">other problems you can&amp;#39;t wear some guide</text>
  <text start="208.77" dur="3.84">all the time when your clothes at least</text>
  <text start="210.09" dur="4.92">not yet that I know of although I will</text>
  <text start="212.61" dur="4.32">actually be looking into having a EMF</text>
  <text start="215.01" dur="3.95">protective clothing line coming up soon</text>
  <text start="216.93" dur="4.26">something functional something simple</text>
  <text start="218.96" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s how I like stuff usually but</text>
  <text start="221.19" dur="5.01">something that would keep you safe in</text>
  <text start="223.43" dur="4.51">even out walk in the streets from all</text>
  <text start="226.2" dur="4.8">the Wi-Fi and the smog and stuff because</text>
  <text start="227.94" dur="6.09">it does build up on you of course c60</text>
  <text start="231" dur="4.32">helps as well at least in my opinion I</text>
  <text start="234.03" dur="3.81">can&amp;#39;t make claims or anything like that</text>
  <text start="235.32" dur="4.83">but it does have some interesting carbon</text>
  <text start="237.84" dur="4.41">properties also in terms of radiation so</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="3.48">and just protecting your body from a lot</text>
  <text start="242.25" dur="4.59">of the free radical damage that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.63" dur="5.25">associated with radiation I think that</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="3.99">is it though this is a simple thing I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="248.88" dur="4.41">not going to make it a fancy product I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="250.83" dur="3.78">keeping it simple and cost down and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="253.29" dur="3.33">just gonna probably do it in ziplock</text>
  <text start="254.61" dur="3.239">baggies or some kind of little baggies</text>
  <text start="256.62" dur="5.369">like that</text>
  <text start="257.849" dur="7.261">of one kilogram each and that&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="261.989" dur="5.191">I did probably half of a kilogram per</text>
  <text start="265.11" dur="5.1">bucket of paint I think that&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="267.18" dur="5.01">a little bit on the weaker end but it</text>
  <text start="270.21" dur="4.98">was enough to cover two big rooms which</text>
  <text start="272.19" dur="5.37">I was trying to hit where the baby and</text>
  <text start="275.19" dur="4.86">family sleeps and where we hang out most</text>
  <text start="277.56" dur="4.139">the time the bigger room so those two</text>
  <text start="280.05" dur="4.32">rooms I was able to cover which</text>
  <text start="281.699" dur="5.101">protected my office on two sides so I</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="3.93">was pretty happy so this is the end of</text>
