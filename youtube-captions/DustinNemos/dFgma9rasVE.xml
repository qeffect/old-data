  <text start="596.87" dur="5.4">is and and if it wasn&amp;#39;t so serious it</text>
  <text start="599.27" dur="5.25">would be a laughable situation so we</text>
  <text start="602.27" dur="4.62">also have the lawless Democrats no</text>

  <text start="616.91" dur="4.77">keep it honest though right so we also</text>
  <text start="619.16" dur="5.82">have Mifsud x&amp;#39; phones obtained by durham</text>
  <text start="621.68" dur="6.45">they have UK SIM cards and tie that ties</text>
  <text start="624.98" dur="5.76">them to the UK but also apparently back</text>
  <text start="628.13" dur="4.08">to John Brennan so we know that the UK</text>
  <text start="630.74" dur="3.09">was involved through five eyes and</text>
  <text start="632.21" dur="3.75">trying to overthrow our president and</text>
  <text start="633.83" dur="5.88">our elections helping John Brennan and</text>
  <text start="635.96" dur="6.03">the CIA to do so but now we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="639.71" dur="4.74">finding that it ties back to Brennan so</text>
  <text start="641.99" dur="4.11">this is a very powerful little piece of</text>
  <text start="644.45" dur="2.94">the puzzle and that&amp;#39;s why Brennan and</text>
  <text start="646.1" dur="3.78">others at the CIA you&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="647.39" dur="5.49">lawyer up possibly and we know Brennan</text>
  <text start="649.88" dur="6.27">is getting very nervous his constant</text>
  <text start="652.88" dur="7.08">tweets his constant voice against our</text>

  <text start="659.96" dur="6.47">know this this is an Islamic radical CIA</text>
  <text start="664.63" dur="5.99">director I mean this guy was powerful</text>
  <text start="666.43" dur="8.79">and crazy and evil so he had a lot of</text>
  <text start="670.62" dur="7.09">reasons to support the other big players</text>
  <text start="675.22" dur="4.38">I guess you&amp;#39;d say in the corruption game</text>
  <text start="677.71" dur="4.2">so you&amp;#39;ve got the Obama&amp;#39;s administration</text>
  <text start="679.6" dur="3.75">you the entire administration you&amp;#39;ve got</text>

  <text start="683.35" dur="5.55">Bush&amp;#39;s stuff like that so this guy has</text>
  <text start="685.54" dur="6.42">dirt on so many people when when Brennan</text>
  <text start="688.9" dur="5.25">goes down I mean it&amp;#39;s gonna be big he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="691.96" dur="4.47">gonna take everyone with him so just</text>
  <text start="694.15" dur="4.23">like the McCabe said I&amp;#39;d he burned down</text>
  <text start="696.43" dur="6.36">the FBI with him or something like that</text>
  <text start="698.38" dur="6.45">like politically speaking well Brennan</text>
  <text start="702.79" dur="4.79">can take down the CIA possibly let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="704.83" dur="5.91">maybe we&amp;#39;ll finally get to fulfill JFK&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="730.03" dur="3.87">are always being sort of pocketed by</text>
  <text start="731.83" dur="4.44">different groups and you know when the</text>
  <text start="733.9" dur="3.96">money goes into politics you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="736.27" dur="4.5">follow it all very well anyway</text>
  <text start="737.86" dur="4.47">and when you do and sometimes you can</text>
  <text start="740.77" dur="3.54">actually get to the end you always find</text>
  <text start="742.33" dur="4.68">it up in the pocket of some evil person</text>
  <text start="744.31" dur="3.18">so it&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going to help</text>
  <text start="747.01" dur="2.22">people</text>
  <text start="747.49" dur="3.66">same thing with charities by the way I</text>
  <text start="749.23" dur="2.31">really encourage people not to give to</text>
  <text start="751.15" dur="2.76">charity</text>
  <text start="751.54" dur="3.81">almost every charity at least the major</text>
  <text start="753.91" dur="3.18">ones that I&amp;#39;ve seen you got to do your</text>
  <text start="755.35" dur="5.4">research the major ones that I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="757.09" dur="6.15">are almost always enriching the few not</text>
  <text start="760.75" dur="4.92">doing the sort of cancer or whatever</text>
  <text start="763.24" dur="3.9">charity that may be not doing anything</text>
  <text start="765.67" dur="4.32">for the cause except raising more money</text>
  <text start="767.14" dur="4.8">for themselves and then 99% or more go</text>
  <text start="769.99" dur="4.22">to the administrative costs and very few</text>
  <text start="771.94" dur="5.49">dollars ever make it to the victims</text>
  <text start="774.21" dur="4.6">there&amp;#39;s a better way and that&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="777.43" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s certainly not the right way to do</text>
  <text start="778.81" dur="3.84">it and all that means is that the good</text>
  <text start="780.85" dur="3.36">people in our world putting all of their</text>
  <text start="782.65" dur="3.69">energy into making the world better are</text>
  <text start="784.21" dur="3.99">actively contributing to the people</text>
  <text start="786.34" dur="5.07">making it worse so they&amp;#39;re actually just</text>
  <text start="788.2" dur="5.61">making it worse and it just it just gets</text>
  <text start="791.41" dur="4.8">worse so a lot of that charity energy</text>
  <text start="793.81" dur="4.56">could be redirected I think now we also</text>
  <text start="796.21" dur="3.6">have Rand Paul blasting</text>
  <text start="798.37" dur="4.17">Lindsey Graham member I said where&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="802.54" dur="3.18">now by not just Rand Paul but many</text>
  <text start="804.339" dur="3.481">people I mean there&amp;#39;s a whole trend</text>
  <text start="805.72" dur="4.38">scene where&amp;#39;s grandma where did Graham</text>
  <text start="807.82" dur="4.769">go and he&amp;#39;s been making a lot of empty</text>
  <text start="810.1" dur="4.38">promises he&amp;#39;s in he&amp;#39;s promised to</text>
  <text start="812.589" dur="5.461">investigate me crane scam the Russia</text>
  <text start="814.48" dur="5.49">hoax Roger stone raid so all of these</text>
  <text start="818.05" dur="5.22">different promises that he&amp;#39;s made I mean</text>
  <text start="819.97" dur="4.59">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s a fire cracker on TV on camera</text>
  <text start="823.27" dur="3.3">I&amp;#39;m gonna do this you better do this</text>
  <text start="824.56" dur="4.08">things like that he&amp;#39;s made statements</text>
  <text start="826.57" dur="6.269">like that but he never follows through</text>
  <text start="828.64" dur="7.23">he&amp;#39;s just a empty words or a big mouth</text>
  <text start="832.839" dur="5.641">you know I&amp;#39;ll talk no action kind of guy</text>
  <text start="835.87" dur="5.58">I guess and some are suspecting that</text>
  <text start="838.48" dur="5.46">maybe he doesn&amp;#39;t want this you know he</text>
  <text start="841.45" dur="4.02">did kind of flip pro-trump in the in the</text>
  <text start="843.94" dur="3.54">optics and the narrative for quite a</text>
  <text start="845.47" dur="4.95">while but maybe now he&amp;#39;s just uh all</text>
  <text start="847.48" dur="4.35">words no action for trauma but in secret</text>
  <text start="850.42" dur="3.66">many are saying are thinking and</text>
  <text start="851.83" dur="4.11">alleging that he&amp;#39;s not willing to pursue</text>
  <text start="854.08" dur="4.98">any of this because it goes back to</text>
  <text start="855.94" dur="6.24">McCain and it would lead to McCain so I</text>
  <text start="859.06" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t know obviously McCain was involved</text>
  <text start="862.18" dur="4.74">in a lot of this himself and was quite</text>
  <text start="864.1" dur="4.739">corrupt maybe that leads to Graham</text>
  <text start="866.92" dur="4.859">himself I don&amp;#39;t know they were very</text>
  <text start="868.839" dur="5.041">close now we also have Ukrainian envoy</text>
  <text start="871.779" dur="5.461">testifying that Trump linked military</text>
  <text start="873.88" dur="5.85">aid to investigations so we have William</text>
  <text start="877.24" dur="5.13">B Taylor jr. the top American diplomat</text>
  <text start="879.73" dur="4.35">in Ukraine implicated president Trump</text>
  <text start="882.37" dur="3.39">personally in an effort to withhold</text>
  <text start="884.08" dur="3.87">security aid until Ukraine&amp;#39;s leader</text>
  <text start="885.76" dur="5.04">agreed to investigate the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="887.95" dur="4.11">political rivals so of course they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="890.8" dur="2.94">really have any information or evidence</text>
  <text start="892.06" dur="4.59">or anything like that they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="893.74" dur="5.34">trying to say that well there were some</text>
  <text start="896.65" dur="4.77">other players involved and they told me</text>
  <text start="899.08" dur="5.37">that the Trump personally knew firsthand</text>
  <text start="901.42" dur="4.98">and that&amp;#39;s this is basically yet and mr.</text>
  <text start="904.45" dur="5.579">Taylor said quote the directive had come</text>
  <text start="906.4" dur="7.41">from the president at least according to</text>
  <text start="910.029" dur="5.671">what he had heard second answer so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="913.81" dur="3.39">get there as well this is gonna be big</text>
  <text start="915.7" dur="3.06">news in the coming days they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>

  <text start="918.76" dur="2.91">not</text>
  <text start="918.97" dur="4.41">and last but not least we have</text>
  <text start="921.67" dur="3.69">representative Nunez concerned</text>

  <text start="984.6" dur="3.66">one of my concerns now is that I want to</text>
  <text start="986.58" dur="4.62">make sure that we preserve the actual</text>
  <text start="988.26" dur="4.2">audio recordings of these witnesses are</text>

  <text start="1013.46" dur="6.87">true and and hilarious and it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="1015.59" dur="6.27">like lies or leaks of false or partial</text>

  <text start="1027.08" dur="5.19">impeachment game yet I&amp;#39;m very optimistic</text>
  <text start="1030.13" dur="3.97">the only thing that would really be</text>
  <text start="1032.27" dur="4.47">concerning is how many of these fake</text>
  <text start="1034.1" dur="4.62">RINO Republicans are gonna flip when</text>

  <text start="1051.41" dur="5.37">Republicans what do we do about those</text>
  <text start="1054.41" dur="4.44">guys they could flip they could try to</text>
  <text start="1056.78" dur="4.62">create a civil war scenario because</text>
  <text start="1058.85" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s what would happen if they impeach</text>

  <text start="1067.49" dur="3.75">follow the one who was president Trump</text>
  <text start="1069.02" dur="5.31">in it and the Democrats probably gonna</text>
  <text start="1071.24" dur="5.58">just disappear to California and try to</text>
  <text start="1074.33" dur="4.949">clean their own government and that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="1076.82" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s all they could do beyond that</text>
  <text start="1079.279" dur="3.571">they&amp;#39;d probably just get arrested when</text>
  <text start="1081.08" dur="2.79">they stop following orders because this</text>
  <text start="1082.85" dur="3.42">is not gonna happen</text>
  <text start="1083.87" dur="4.529">we have huge armies and all this other</text>
  <text start="1086.27" dur="4.5">stuff you can&amp;#39;t actually effectively</text>
  <text start="1088.399" dur="5.581">pull off the kind of power coup that</text>
  <text start="1090.77" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re trying without the military so</text>
  <text start="1093.98" dur="5.189">unless they can take down the man</text>

  <text start="1111.14" dur="3.87">Democrats have a path for it I think</text>
  <text start="1112.76" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s reactionary I think it&amp;#39;s because</text>
