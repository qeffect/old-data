  <text start="0.41" dur="5.05">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="3.06" dur="4.56">most of destiny most calm and I am very</text>
  <text start="5.46" dur="4.8">excited and happy to be rejoined once</text>
  <text start="7.62" dur="4.979">again by Lynette saying chief market</text>
  <text start="10.26" dur="4.829">analysts at ITM trading and just a</text>
  <text start="12.599" dur="4.861">all-around brilliant person one of the</text>
  <text start="15.089" dur="4.921">the big brains in the field I think so</text>
  <text start="17.46" dur="5.159">how are you Lynette well I&amp;#39;m very happy</text>
  <text start="20.01" dur="4.56">to be here actually invested so I feel</text>
  <text start="22.619" dur="3.781">the same way about being here as you</text>
  <text start="24.57" dur="4.25">feel about having me here it&amp;#39;s a nice</text>
  <text start="26.4" dur="4.379">thing you&amp;#39;re very bright thank you</text>
  <text start="28.82" dur="3.669">hopefully I&amp;#39;ll ask good questions on</text>
  <text start="30.779" dur="4.561">this one as well there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="32.489" dur="5.431">of things on my mind because obviously</text>
  <text start="35.34" dur="4.2">October&amp;#39;s been very bumpy ride there is</text>
  <text start="37.92" dur="4.049">the liquidity issue you you wanted to</text>
  <text start="39.54" dur="4.35">touch on that as well and you had kind</text>
  <text start="41.969" dur="4.141">of made the idea that most people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="43.89" dur="3.54">really understand the full scope of</text>
  <text start="46.11" dur="2.699">what&amp;#39;s going on with a liquidity issue</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="5.19">and I agree that&amp;#39;s something we should</text>
  <text start="48.809" dur="5.761">dive into and just kind of where things</text>
  <text start="52.62" dur="3.63">are going with maybe the petro dollar or</text>
  <text start="54.57" dur="4.02">the the currency shift and all of that</text>
  <text start="56.25" dur="5.489">so I&amp;#39;ll take up as much of your time as</text>
  <text start="58.59" dur="4.739">you can today but you know we&amp;#39;ll dive in</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="5.731">this is a big one to talk about knocked</text>
  <text start="63.329" dur="5.881">over it has been drastic so you want to</text>
  <text start="67.47" dur="4.95">start with maybe the liquidity or maybe</text>
  <text start="69.21" dur="5.67">recapping October well you know the both</text>
  <text start="72.42" dur="4.41">of those flow really well because a big</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="4.2">part of why you&amp;#39;re seeing these enormous</text>
  <text start="76.83" dur="5.16">moves I mean I think yesterday and the</text>
  <text start="79.08" dur="6.06">Dow had a nine hundred point move up and</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="6.09">down throughout the day so we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="6.57">a lot more volatility don&amp;#39;t excuse me</text>
  <text start="88.08" dur="6.44">but a big reason for that is because</text>
  <text start="91.71" dur="6.81">over time and this really started in the</text>
  <text start="94.52" dur="7.63">2000s but over time there has become a</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="6.779">more and more narrow base of buyer and</text>
  <text start="102.15" dur="6.69">in any market you need a lot of</text>
  <text start="105.299" dur="6.811">different areas of buying to support a</text>
  <text start="108.84" dur="6.599">market so there used to be market makers</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="5.91">well when interbank lending imploded</text>
  <text start="115.439" dur="5.011">actually they started to go right away</text>
  <text start="118.02" dur="5.58">in the 2000s but that killed that market</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="4.86">so a market maker would be a firm that</text>
  <text start="123.6" dur="3.839">would go in when we&amp;#39;re having the kind</text>
  <text start="125.31" dur="5.96">of days that we&amp;#39;ve seen in October and</text>
  <text start="127.439" dur="6.391">put a floor underneath the bottom of it</text>
  <text start="131.27" dur="4.2">but they don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="5.7">anymore because it has not been</text>
  <text start="135.47" dur="6.7">profitable for them to exist so what</text>
  <text start="139.53" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;re really seeing I think well I think</text>
  <text start="142.17" dur="5.1">it was either September or earlier this</text>
  <text start="144.6" dur="5.07">month when the headline was that the</text>
  <text start="147.27" dur="5.67">last buyer in the market our stock</text>
  <text start="149.67" dur="5.7">buybacks and we&amp;#39;re still in the middle</text>
  <text start="152.94" dur="4.49">of earnings season which means that</text>
  <text start="155.37" dur="5.37">there is a and there is a freeze on</text>
  <text start="157.43" dur="6.37">corporations buying back their stock for</text>
  <text start="160.74" dur="7.52">a certain period of time to include up</text>
  <text start="163.8" dur="8.85">until two days after they issue their</text>
  <text start="168.26" dur="5.95">quarterly report so that&amp;#39;s a lot of what</text>
  <text start="172.65" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re seeing with the level of</text>
  <text start="174.21" dur="5.88">volatility is there sellers but there</text>
  <text start="177.87" dur="6.06">are no buyers that are stepping in and</text>
  <text start="180.09" dur="6.72">that&amp;#39;s a big problem because where&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="5.45">mom and pops where those market makers</text>
  <text start="186.81" dur="4.68">heck where&amp;#39;s the plunge Protection team</text>
  <text start="189.38" dur="3.76">yeah I was gonna ask about the the</text>
  <text start="191.49" dur="3.96">plunge Protection team they don&amp;#39;t seem</text>
  <text start="193.14" dur="5.1">to be doing a very good job lately and</text>
  <text start="195.45" dur="4.8">and you know you touched on it October</text>
  <text start="198.24" dur="3.66">has been pretty wild people were</text>
  <text start="200.25" dur="3.99">screaming October was gonna be a bad</text>
  <text start="201.9" dur="5.37">month just going into it it was not like</text>
  <text start="204.24" dur="6.96">a big shock or anything you know the</text>
  <text start="207.27" dur="6.09">liquidity issues aside I wanted to kind</text>
  <text start="211.2" dur="6.27">of touch Gore go ahead well I was gonna</text>
  <text start="213.36" dur="6.96">say what was really shocking was how</text>
  <text start="217.47" dur="5.61">easily well you know we had this</text>
  <text start="220.32" dur="6.24">divergence in the markets where the US</text>
  <text start="223.08" dur="6.12">markets continued up but the rest of the</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="5.49">world&amp;#39;s markets were really entering</text>
  <text start="229.2" dur="7.14">into first correction and then in many</text>
  <text start="232.05" dur="6.78">cases bear market territory and then all</text>
  <text start="236.34" dur="6.9">of a sudden what we&amp;#39;ve seen is that the</text>
  <text start="238.83" dur="7.71">US markets plunging down to connect with</text>
  <text start="243.24" dur="5.43">the global markets and so I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="246.54" dur="6.72">anybody doesn&amp;#39;t look to me like Main</text>
  <text start="248.67" dur="8.46">Street media expected the prices on the</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="8.37">indexes to slice through that 200-day</text>
  <text start="257.13" dur="6.81">moving average so easily and so deeply I</text>
  <text start="261.63" dur="5.97">think that&amp;#39;s shocked a lot of people in</text>
  <text start="263.94" dur="5.58">mainstream media the Talking Heads core</text>
  <text start="267.6" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re kind of facing a titanic situation</text>
  <text start="269.52" dur="3.96">the pride and then they just kind of</text>
  <text start="271.77" dur="7.17">ignore the dangers and then they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="273.48" dur="8.25">sunk yeah right I mean it was it was</text>
  <text start="278.94" dur="5.55">great when it was going up and if it had</text>
  <text start="281.73" dur="4.92">just kissed that 200-day moving average</text>
  <text start="284.49" dur="4.17">they would have been okay with that if</text>
  <text start="286.65" dur="5.91">you look at the charts and graphs that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.66" dur="6.87">essentially what&amp;#39;s happened really other</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="6.09">than certain periods of time since they</text>
  <text start="295.53" dur="5.58">started the chui all of that injecting</text>
  <text start="298.65" dur="5.13">of the money into the stock market</text>
  <text start="301.11" dur="5.49">there were blips when it was in jeopardy</text>
  <text start="303.78" dur="5.58">of breaking down well this is another</text>
  <text start="306.6" dur="5.25">blip and what was their answer to all</text>
  <text start="309.36" dur="3.9">those other blips when that was when</text>
  <text start="311.85" dur="5.01">they were losing control and market</text>
  <text start="313.26" dur="6.33">injecting more money but now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="316.86" dur="5.67">going in well I don&amp;#39;t want to say</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="5.55">completely the opposite direction but</text>
  <text start="322.53" dur="5.07">globally the central banks are not</text>
  <text start="325.14" dur="6.87">injecting as much money in this country</text>
  <text start="327.6" dur="6.72">we&amp;#39;re starting to run off at least in</text>
  <text start="332.01" dur="4.98">this form of Treasuries we&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="334.32" dur="6.09">off that balance sheet and elsewhere</text>
  <text start="336.99" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same or not the same</text>
  <text start="340.41" dur="5.28">kind of contraction but in Europe and</text>
  <text start="342.84" dur="5.85">even in Japan they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="345.69" dur="6.51">contract how much money they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="5.61">in because after a while the more they</text>
  <text start="352.2" dur="5.55">put in the less value it has let&amp;#39;s face</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="5.64">it yeah the returns on that kind of</text>
  <text start="357.75" dur="5.82">money printing have gone down to like 1%</text>
  <text start="359.94" dur="5.7">of what it was originally I think will</text>
  <text start="363.57" dur="5.04">they do it again oh yeah they&amp;#39;ll do it</text>
  <text start="365.64" dur="6.09">again will it matter probably not really</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="5.79">yeah I like mike maloney he pulls a lot</text>
  <text start="371.73" dur="4.77">of people&amp;#39;s suggestions into well not</text>
  <text start="374.4" dur="4.05">suggestions into the history between</text>
  <text start="376.5" dur="3.51">like Rome the parallels the sort I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="378.45" dur="4.62">looking for between Rome and modern us</text>
  <text start="380.01" dur="4.65">the kind of devaluation that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="383.07" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s gonna catch everybody who I</text>
  <text start="384.66" dur="4.8">surprised it could end up with a</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="4.65">complete upside down society some people</text>
  <text start="389.46" dur="4.23">even think that that the central banks</text>
  <text start="390.78" dur="6.57">are trying to intentionally do this</text>
  <text start="393.69" dur="5.34">maybe to hurt the populist movements not</text>
  <text start="397.35" dur="3.56">just trumpet across the world right now</text>
  <text start="399.03" dur="5.27">it seems</text>
  <text start="400.91" dur="5.58">what do you feel okay I think that the</text>
  <text start="404.3" dur="7.38">populist movements are the biggest</text>
  <text start="406.49" dur="8.19">threat to their you know plan as it were</text>
  <text start="411.68" dur="5.22">and what I mean by that the goal is to</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="4.35">transfer all of this wealth but to</text>
  <text start="416.9" dur="4.77">remain in power on the other side of it</text>
  <text start="419.03" dur="5.46">because the next step is about attacking</text>
  <text start="421.67" dur="5.85">principle this this part was about</text>
  <text start="424.49" dur="5.61">attacking value and purchasing power and</text>
  <text start="427.52" dur="6.21">what you&amp;#39;re willing to work for so the</text>
  <text start="430.1" dur="6.03">populist movement are because really the</text>
  <text start="433.73" dur="7.2">division between you know the income</text>
  <text start="436.13" dur="8.4">inequality so that 1% versus the 99% of</text>
  <text start="440.93" dur="7.32">us that&amp;#39;s gotten so wide it&amp;#39;s so obvious</text>
  <text start="444.53" dur="8.58">that what we&amp;#39;re seeing in the markets</text>
  <text start="448.25" dur="9.75">today could actually broaden the</text>
  <text start="453.11" dur="8.09">populist movement not shrink it so you</text>
  <text start="458" dur="5.7">know I&amp;#39;ve my thought though honestly on</text>
  <text start="461.2" dur="5.29">whether or not the central banks are</text>
  <text start="463.7" dur="8.63">what they&amp;#39;re engineering what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="466.49" dur="8.42">attempting to do is a soft transition</text>
  <text start="472.33" dur="7.8">has it ever been done before</text>
  <text start="474.91" dur="9.55">historically no and there are so many</text>
  <text start="480.13" dur="7.14">hidden dangers that nobody even sees</text>
  <text start="484.46" dur="7.14">including the guys that create this mess</text>
  <text start="487.27" dur="6.97">that an event that that would overwhelm</text>
  <text start="491.6" dur="5.88">the central bank&amp;#39;s ability to keep this</text>
  <text start="494.24" dur="5.49">thing going is highly probable highly</text>
  <text start="497.48" dur="6.06">probable and they know it too there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="499.73" dur="7.14">too many moving parts but I do know from</text>
  <text start="503.54" dur="7.379">history that a lot of crisis were</text>
  <text start="506.87" dur="8.04">actually engineered to justify the next</text>
  <text start="510.919" dur="5.101">step I mean 29 was engineered even</text>
  <text start="514.91" dur="3.93">though you don&amp;#39;t see that in the</text>
  <text start="516.02" dur="4.649">textbooks they knew darn well that</text>
  <text start="518.84" dur="4.53">printing two and a half times the amount</text>
  <text start="520.669" dur="4.981">of money to gold and then injecting it</text>
  <text start="523.37" dur="4.26">into stock markets bond markets the real</text>
  <text start="525.65" dur="4.29">estate market was going to create a</text>
  <text start="527.63" dur="3.4">bubble especially when all of that</text>
  <text start="529.94" dur="4.3">credit was a</text>
  <text start="531.03" dur="6.54">to the masses for the first time they</text>
  <text start="534.24" dur="7.17">took away the credit after the insiders</text>
  <text start="537.57" dur="6.42">got out mostly got out and who aided on</text>
  <text start="541.41" dur="4.74">the chin and then they justified taking</text>
  <text start="543.99" dur="4.77">the gold away they got to get the cash</text>
  <text start="546.15" dur="6.18">out of the people&amp;#39;s hands now because</text>
  <text start="548.76" dur="6.03">that creates some similar limitations so</text>
  <text start="552.33" dur="6.18">to create a crisis and to create a crash</text>
  <text start="554.79" dur="6.45">and to create a war and to create lots</text>
  <text start="558.51" dur="5.61">of chaos to distract you from what</text>
  <text start="561.24" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re really doing an engineer that</text>
  <text start="564.12" dur="5.96">transition that happens that you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="566.79" dur="6.53">even realize that it happened I mean</text>
  <text start="570.08" dur="6.31">they employ a lot of psychiatrists and</text>
  <text start="573.32" dur="4.66">psychologists yeah there&amp;#39;s been behind</text>
  <text start="576.39" dur="3.27">almost every major event in history not</text>
  <text start="577.98" dur="3.69">just the economic depressions things</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="4.2">like that there&amp;#39;s always powerful people</text>
  <text start="581.67" dur="11.01">with the agendas of their own and the</text>
  <text start="583.86" dur="11.97">victors write the history books so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="592.68" dur="5.73">actually a process of reading of writing</text>
  <text start="595.83" dur="6.36">a book right now we&amp;#39;re I&amp;#39;m about 3/4 of</text>
  <text start="598.41" dur="6.06">the way done ish so but maybe my next</text>
  <text start="602.19" dur="3.69">book will be on that transition cuz</text>
  <text start="604.47" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;ll look very different than what you</text>
  <text start="605.88" dur="4.32">see in the schools for sure we need more</text>
  <text start="608.85" dur="4.23">of it I recently did an interview about</text>
  <text start="610.2" dur="5.67">just the education system and and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="613.08" dur="4.62">a whole topic to go into where are we</text>
  <text start="615.87" dur="5.88">with the the petro dollar and the</text>
  <text start="617.7" dur="5.97">worldwide shift away you know it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="621.75" dur="3.78">interesting time for the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="623.67" dur="5.27">look at what&amp;#39;s happening with Saudi</text>
  <text start="625.53" dur="6.77">Arabia and they&amp;#39;re almost being you know</text>
  <text start="628.94" dur="5.56">isolated but China has already</text>
  <text start="632.3" dur="4.33">repositioned to take advantage of that</text>
  <text start="634.5" dur="6.33">transition away from the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="636.63" dur="7.32">and let&amp;#39;s face it if the battery is</text>
  <text start="640.83" dur="6.6">going to electric and the ability you</text>
  <text start="643.95" dur="5.33">know the alternative energy tools once</text>
  <text start="647.43" dur="4.08">that really kicks into gear</text>
  <text start="649.28" dur="7.09">perhaps oil isn&amp;#39;t going to be as</text>
  <text start="651.51" dur="6.87">important as it is right now but if you</text>
  <text start="656.37" dur="6.08">look at what&amp;#39;s happening with Saudi</text>
  <text start="658.38" dur="5.72">Arabia and all of the countries kind of</text>
  <text start="662.45" dur="3.629">isolating them</text>
  <text start="664.1" dur="5.03">I think we&amp;#39;re in a really interesting</text>
  <text start="666.079" dur="5.731">place with the petrodollar right now</text>
  <text start="669.13" dur="6.37">China actually is cutting a deal with</text>
  <text start="671.81" dur="8.269">them for oil for gold right yes oil for</text>
  <text start="675.5" dur="7.05">yuan well for yuan and it&amp;#39;s also easily</text>
  <text start="680.079" dur="5.231">converted I think maybe they are also</text>
  <text start="682.55" dur="7.289">doing something with oil for gold i know</text>
  <text start="685.31" dur="6.6">writing is right it&amp;#39;s but it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="689.839" dur="4.98">bigger than that because it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="691.91" dur="7.32">foundation of the system and the reason</text>
  <text start="694.819" dur="8.27">why we still at least technically retain</text>
  <text start="699.23" dur="6.87">the title of world reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="703.089" dur="5.44">and china is in a bit of a sticky wicket</text>
  <text start="706.1" dur="4.799">with that right now but yes china has</text>
  <text start="708.529" dur="4.951">gone in and created all sorts of private</text>
  <text start="710.899" dur="6.271">deals actually all around the world</text>
  <text start="713.48" dur="7.19">pertaining to energy and going into</text>
  <text start="717.17" dur="7.2">countries like Venezuela and Argentina</text>
  <text start="720.67" dur="6.58">and different oil-rich countries and</text>
  <text start="724.37" dur="4.74">really indebting them because if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="727.25" dur="3.779">indebted to you and they can&amp;#39;t pay their</text>
  <text start="729.11" dur="4.95">debt guess what happens to your</text>
  <text start="731.029" dur="8.101">resources your natural resources which</text>
  <text start="734.06" dur="10.23">are at least in theory owned by the</text>
  <text start="739.13" dur="8.689">public and periodically right that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="744.29" dur="7.14">socialist always justified at theft yeah</text>
  <text start="747.819" dur="6.01">so I know China there&amp;#39;s the trade war</text>
  <text start="751.43" dur="4.11">going on China is is hurting they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="753.829" dur="3.18">putting on a good face over and there</text>
  <text start="755.54" dur="3.989">they&amp;#39;re doing their financial games to</text>
  <text start="757.009" dur="7.2">try to manipulate everything which seems</text>
  <text start="759.529" dur="6.961">to be diminishing returns as well not</text>
  <text start="764.209" dur="3.81">working real well is it yeah do you</text>
  <text start="766.49" dur="5.48">think that we&amp;#39;re winning the trade war</text>
  <text start="768.019" dur="7.92">in terms of who&amp;#39;s suffering the most</text>
  <text start="771.97" dur="6.039">well yeah probably I mean we certainly</text>
  <text start="775.939" dur="6.15">have a whole lot further that we can</text>
  <text start="778.009" dur="7.14">push them and perhaps other resources</text>
  <text start="782.089" dur="7.201">that we can draw from to get what we</text>
  <text start="785.149" dur="6.601">need and to sell to but over and and I</text>
  <text start="789.29" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t disagree I mean I I&amp;#39;ve really</text>
  <text start="791.75" dur="3.24">always thought that the theft of</text>
  <text start="793.16" dur="4.47">intellectual property and the way they</text>
  <text start="794.99" dur="6.69">all they connected the yuan to the doll</text>
  <text start="797.63" dur="6.84">to encourage manufacturing over there so</text>
  <text start="801.68" dur="5.93">that corporations because it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="804.47" dur="6.42">become a corporate world let&amp;#39;s face it</text>
  <text start="807.61" dur="5.73">you know all of these trade agreements</text>
  <text start="810.89" dur="6.14">were based upon corporate sovereignty</text>
  <text start="813.34" dur="6.16">over government sovereignty and again</text>
  <text start="817.03" dur="6.16">governments at least in theory are</text>
  <text start="819.5" dur="6.27">supposed to represent the public so when</text>
  <text start="823.19" dur="4.83">a corporation can all return a</text>
  <text start="825.77" dur="4.65">government because the government has</text>
  <text start="828.02" dur="4.95">made a law that the corporation is going</text>
  <text start="830.42" dur="4.56">to make a little less money or if they</text>
  <text start="832.97" dur="4.59">want to do business like in the case of</text>
  <text start="834.98" dur="7.32">China they have to hand over all of</text>
  <text start="837.56" dur="7.23">their proprietary information but when</text>
  <text start="842.3" dur="4.91">you&amp;#39;re also thinking about China they</text>
  <text start="844.79" dur="5.67">have a member of the Communist Party</text>
  <text start="847.21" dur="5.86">embedded in every single corporation</text>
  <text start="850.46" dur="5.34">there and also every single educational</text>
  <text start="853.07" dur="8.04">institution whether they&amp;#39;re Chinese or</text>
  <text start="855.8" dur="8.67">they&amp;#39;re not so and I think China has</text>
  <text start="861.11" dur="7.17">made it really really clear that what</text>
  <text start="864.47" dur="7.17">they want is absolute and full control</text>
  <text start="868.28" dur="6.21">and they have obviously the surveillance</text>
  <text start="871.64" dur="6.15">state and what they&amp;#39;re doing with credit</text>
  <text start="874.49" dur="5.94">to make people toe the line and do what</text>
  <text start="877.79" dur="6.6">they want them to do and not go against</text>
  <text start="880.43" dur="7.44">the Communist Party but again it kind of</text>
  <text start="884.39" dur="6.96">have some uprisings going in there as</text>
  <text start="887.87" dur="5.46">well so I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not in China</text>
  <text start="891.35" dur="4.68">if anybody knows this I&amp;#39;d certainly</text>
  <text start="893.33" dur="5.46">appreciate knowing this but from what</text>
  <text start="896.03" dur="4.95">I&amp;#39;m reading and from from my research I</text>
  <text start="898.79" dur="3.75">think you&amp;#39;ve got I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="900.98" dur="6.03">easy in trying to either</text>
  <text start="902.54" dur="8.09">I think globally you have you&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="907.01" dur="7.65">a growing number of people pushing back</text>
  <text start="910.63" dur="6.64">so I know that they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="914.66" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s a lot of hate him or love them a</text>
  <text start="917.27" dur="4.23">lot of Bitcoin lovers or crypto lovers</text>
  <text start="919.4" dur="3.39">in general or in China and at one point</text>
  <text start="921.5" dur="3.21">they just kind of banned them all and</text>
  <text start="922.79" dur="3.81">they were still doing it so there is</text>
  <text start="924.71" dur="3.24">some sort of a rebellious spark going on</text>
  <text start="926.6" dur="3.3">and this kind of trade war that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="927.95" dur="3.429">putting more pressure on the population</text>
  <text start="929.9" dur="2.619">you know who knows where the</text>
  <text start="931.379" dur="4.8">I believe there may be something good</text>
  <text start="932.519" dur="6.78">could come of that as I the end it most</text>
  <text start="936.179" dur="6.3">of China is still very poor so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="939.299" dur="4.71">still going to be very poor whereas the</text>
  <text start="942.479" dur="3.36">country itself is not even</text>
  <text start="944.009" dur="4.44">self-sufficient they cannot necessarily</text>
  <text start="945.839" dur="5.43">feed themselves they have a huge import</text>
  <text start="948.449" dur="5.49">raw Goods export crap items to the world</text>
  <text start="951.269" dur="4.68">business but that&amp;#39;s not working out as</text>
  <text start="953.939" dur="3">well now so that&amp;#39;s the only thing really</text>
  <text start="955.949" dur="2.49">keeping them going and then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="956.939" dur="4.5">making these terrible deals like</text>
  <text start="958.439" dur="4.2">predatory lending you know parts of the</text>
  <text start="961.439" dur="3.71">world</text>
  <text start="962.639" dur="6.15">smart deals from Chinese perspective</text>
  <text start="965.149" dur="5.23">whereas the US as I understand it is</text>
  <text start="968.789" dur="3.36">somewhat self-sufficient we could be</text>
  <text start="970.379" dur="3.18">energy efficient if we choose to I mean</text>
  <text start="972.149" dur="4.2">Trump seems to be doing things in that</text>
  <text start="973.559" dur="5.7">direction as well so well he does and</text>
  <text start="976.349" dur="6.39">you know I&amp;#39;m a big believer that we all</text>
  <text start="979.259" dur="7.31">need the base of security which is that</text>
  <text start="982.739" dur="6.75">food that water that energy security</text>
  <text start="986.569" dur="6.43">barter ability wealth preservation and</text>
  <text start="989.489" dur="6.24">community and you know these things work</text>
  <text start="992.999" dur="5.37">on every single level whether it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="995.729" dur="6.84">individual or corporation or a</text>
  <text start="998.369" dur="6.87">government you know and and a country so</text>
  <text start="1002.569" dur="6.96">I think if if the units are there and</text>
  <text start="1005.239" dur="6.72">the community units are there and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1009.529" dur="5.85">not losing our intellectual property or</text>
  <text start="1011.959" dur="5.54">properties so easily we need something</text>
  <text start="1015.379" dur="5.91">to rebuild pulling back the</text>
  <text start="1017.499" dur="5.92">manufacturing I mean the reset is is</text>
  <text start="1021.289" dur="3.66">baked into the cake because the system</text>
  <text start="1023.419" dur="5.79">and the tools that they had to manage</text>
  <text start="1024.949" dur="7.14">this system died in 2008 they&amp;#39;re gone</text>
  <text start="1029.209" dur="5.011">they&amp;#39;re simply gone sorry but they are</text>
  <text start="1032.089" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s what all the data and evidence</text>
  <text start="1034.22" dur="6.15">says so what it&amp;#39;s going to look like</text>
  <text start="1037.339" dur="5.37">moving forward that&amp;#39;s what I hope we</text>
  <text start="1040.37" dur="5.339">have some influence over but I think</text>
  <text start="1042.709" dur="5.011">even as an individual food water energy</text>
  <text start="1045.709" dur="4.95">security bar durability wealth</text>
  <text start="1047.72" dur="5.429">preservation and community yeah we do</text>
  <text start="1050.659" dur="4.801">that that definitely those are wise</text>
  <text start="1053.149" dur="4.77">things vulnerable skills self</text>
  <text start="1055.46" dur="6.48">sufficiency big big things to look into</text>
  <text start="1057.919" dur="5.551">for sure at some point I don&amp;#39;t some</text>
  <text start="1061.94" dur="3.38">people say deflations before inflation</text>
  <text start="1063.47" dur="4.579">some people just say what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1065.32" dur="7.02">straight into inflation but at some</text>
  <text start="1068.049" dur="6.12">point as this system does it&amp;#39;s recent do</text>
  <text start="1072.34" dur="3.419">you think that the standard of living is</text>
  <text start="1074.169" dur="2.88">going to you know go through a dark</text>
  <text start="1075.759" dur="5.04">period and then shoot through the roof</text>
  <text start="1077.049" dur="6.691">with a new system well sure but I think</text>
  <text start="1080.799" dur="6.12">a lot of people miss is that inflation</text>
  <text start="1083.74" dur="5.46">is the flip side of deflation and</text>
  <text start="1086.919" dur="4.651">there&amp;#39;s only one way to fight that so</text>
  <text start="1089.2" dur="5.579">what&amp;#39;s deflationary well let&amp;#39;s see if</text>
  <text start="1091.57" dur="6.12">the stock markets implode wiping out</text>
  <text start="1094.779" dur="5.52">what people perceive to be their wealth</text>
  <text start="1097.69" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s deflationary if real estate prop</text>
  <text start="1100.299" dur="5.521">properties prices go down</text>
  <text start="1103" dur="3.059">that&amp;#39;s deflationary if bond prices go</text>
  <text start="1105.82" dur="4.04">down</text>
  <text start="1106.059" dur="7.141">that&amp;#39;s all deflationary we had that in</text>
  <text start="1109.86" dur="5.83">2008 they said no no no we can&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1113.2" dur="6.359">that so that&amp;#39;s when they started the</text>
  <text start="1115.69" dur="8.55">inflation with the QE and they reflate</text>
  <text start="1119.559" dur="8.37">&amp;#39;add those asset classes so you know</text>
  <text start="1124.24" dur="7.47">deflation inflation is baked into the</text>
  <text start="1127.929" dur="6.031">cake and and by the way it&amp;#39;s not like I</text>
  <text start="1131.71" dur="7.049">don&amp;#39;t care what they say think about</text>
  <text start="1133.96" dur="7.199">your personal experience if from 2008 to</text>
  <text start="1138.759" dur="5.341">today has your cost of living gone down</text>
  <text start="1141.159" dur="6.931">has the cost of medical or insurance or</text>
  <text start="1144.1" dur="7.529">education or food gone down no nothing</text>
  <text start="1148.09" dur="6.959">has gone down for you it&amp;#39;s all cost you</text>
  <text start="1151.629" dur="6.361">more that&amp;#39;s inflation it&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="1155.049" dur="6.151">hyperinflation which means that it</text>
  <text start="1157.99" dur="7.069">didn&amp;#39;t happen overnight it&amp;#39;s happened</text>
  <text start="1161.2" dur="7.53">over the course of 10 years so you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1165.059" dur="5.98">perceive that there&amp;#39;s a much inflation</text>
  <text start="1168.73" dur="5.819">plus they keep telling you strong dollar</text>
  <text start="1171.039" dur="4.951">and you know and there&amp;#39;s no inflation we</text>
  <text start="1174.549" dur="6.031">need more inflation we need more</text>
  <text start="1175.99" dur="8.46">inflation the stealth tax basically yeah</text>
  <text start="1180.58" dur="5.61">I comparable to uh basically real fast</text>
  <text start="1184.45" dur="3.54">cuz a metaphor that everybody really</text>
  <text start="1186.19" dur="3.42">understands is trying to fill up a</text>
  <text start="1187.99" dur="3.96">bucket that asshole holes in the bottom</text>
  <text start="1189.61" dur="3.539">of it with water or maybe sand or</text>
  <text start="1191.95" dur="2.849">something like that it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="1193.149" dur="3.931">how hard you work you&amp;#39;re always losing</text>
  <text start="1194.799" dur="5.271">from your your savings and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1197.08" dur="2.99">inflation does to people</text>
  <text start="1200.159" dur="5.23">exactly or the frog in the pot of water</text>
  <text start="1202.599" dur="5.611">is another one by the time the Frog has</text>
  <text start="1205.389" dur="5.431">cooked he cannot he does not have the</text>
  <text start="1208.21" dur="5.009">ability to jump out of the pot we were</text>
  <text start="1210.82" dur="4.89">less than 4 cents out of the original</text>
  <text start="1213.219" dur="6.601">value of the dollar less than 4 cents</text>
  <text start="1215.71" dur="9.87">and continuously dropping because every</text>
  <text start="1219.82" dur="7.679">single fiat currency goes to zero and</text>
  <text start="1225.58" dur="3.209">then I love when people are saying when</text>
  <text start="1227.499" dur="3.24">is there gonna happen when is it going</text>
  <text start="1228.789" dur="5.33">to happen and they they haven&amp;#39;t noticed</text>
  <text start="1230.739" dur="6.63">mostly it&amp;#39;s already done yeah every day</text>
  <text start="1234.119" dur="7.9">when no what they&amp;#39;re really saying is</text>
  <text start="1237.369" dur="7.53">when am I gonna know I you know pirate</text>
  <text start="1242.019" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;ll compare compare some numbers to the</text>
  <text start="1244.899" dur="4.44">cost of living then and now and then of</text>
  <text start="1247.269" dur="4.561">course you make more money but then go</text>
  <text start="1249.339" dur="5.97">and compare that and contrast it with</text>
  <text start="1251.83" dur="5.37">the the quality of life that you could</text>
  <text start="1255.309" dur="3.511">have bought in those times working the</text>
  <text start="1257.2" dur="3.599">same hours the same kind of job that you</text>
  <text start="1258.82" dur="4.799">work now you&amp;#39;re gonna find that in those</text>
  <text start="1260.799" dur="4.59">days you know one example I like to use</text>
  <text start="1263.619" dur="4.44">because I&amp;#39;m you know I&amp;#39;m the guy is that</text>
  <text start="1265.389" dur="4.441">a man could support a large family and a</text>
  <text start="1268.059" dur="4.68">stay-at-home wife and put himself</text>
  <text start="1269.83" dur="5.009">through school and still work and be</text>
  <text start="1272.739" dur="5.07">very successful and not have too many</text>
  <text start="1274.839" dur="4.95">stresses that was the golden era and now</text>
  <text start="1277.809" dur="3.57">you know you need a to two-parent</text>
  <text start="1279.789" dur="4.651">household income to be able to support</text>
  <text start="1281.379" dur="6.9">maybe one maybe two kids if you&amp;#39;re lucky</text>
  <text start="1284.44" dur="7.199">so lost a lot of lifestyle and just to</text>
  <text start="1288.279" dur="5.911">kind of make that comparison in I think</text>
  <text start="1291.639" dur="5.37">70 or 71 the average income was like</text>
  <text start="1294.19" dur="5.76">ninety six hundred a year and you could</text>
  <text start="1297.009" dur="6.691">afford to support a family of four on</text>
  <text start="1299.95" dur="5.399">one income well I think was poverty now</text>
  <text start="1303.7" dur="3">some they&amp;#39;re like twenty eight thousand</text>
  <text start="1305.349" dur="4.44">or something like that</text>
  <text start="1306.7" dur="5.669">that&amp;#39;s the poverty level average income</text>
  <text start="1309.789" dur="6.84">I think is fifty-six thousand and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1312.369" dur="7.35">right you need two people working making</text>
  <text start="1316.629" dur="5.13">a hundred or so a year and you&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="1319.719" dur="7.08">not able to save five hundred bucks and</text>
  <text start="1321.759" dur="8.49">in the case of an emergency you know and</text>
  <text start="1326.799" dur="6.171">China kind of going back to to us and</text>
  <text start="1330.249" dur="5.361">the shift and all of this because it all</text>
  <text start="1332.97" dur="5.34">you know they started to transition us</text>
  <text start="1335.61" dur="5.94">into a consumer-driven economy in the</text>
  <text start="1338.31" dur="5.01">20s by making that credit available was</text>

  <text start="1661.02" dur="4.38">those ounces would be I think it was</text>
  <text start="1663.27" dur="4.61">something like 400 thousand or something</text>
  <text start="1665.4" dur="5.58">like that now even with these</text>

  <text start="1974.24" dur="4.71">daughter&amp;#39;s only seven months but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1975.53" dur="6.3">already thinking you know thank you</text>
  <text start="1978.95" dur="4.11">she&amp;#39;s a she&amp;#39;s a bossing my idea here and</text>
  <text start="1981.83" dur="10.17">this is something people can just kind</text>
  <text start="1983.06" dur="12">of build off for their I hear you my</text>
  <text start="1992" dur="4.98">idea was to to create like a game or</text>
  <text start="1995.06" dur="3.27">like a some sort of thing that tasks</text>
  <text start="1996.98" dur="2.88">that they could complete like a go</text>
  <text start="1998.33" dur="4.32">accomplish this mission even if</text>
  <text start="1999.86" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s run to your mom or deliver a</text>
  <text start="2002.65" dur="4.89">message or something like that and then</text>
  <text start="2004.33" dur="4.8">they can earn like some sort of maybe</text>
  <text start="2007.54" dur="3.24">buy some of those Ron Paul for copper</text>
  <text start="2009.13" dur="3.75">coins or something shiny and cool but</text>
  <text start="2010.78" dur="4.89">doesn&amp;#39;t have to be real dirty money or</text>
  <text start="2012.88" dur="5.22">whatever and then you teach them to earn</text>
  <text start="2015.67" dur="3.72">and achieve goals and do with all that</text>
  <text start="2018.1" dur="3.209">and that&amp;#39;s really good for character</text>
  <text start="2019.39" dur="3.33">building but then you take some of it</text>
  <text start="2021.309" dur="3.691">away and you&amp;#39;re like this is taxation</text>
  <text start="2022.72" dur="5.28">and then you double the price of things</text>
  <text start="2025" dur="5.1">and this this is inflation and then yeah</text>
  <text start="2028" dur="5.36">you&amp;#39;ve you&amp;#39;ve built it into that child</text>
  <text start="2030.1" dur="6.75">forever at least I feel like couple that</text>
  <text start="2033.36" dur="5.74">with some like real goals and silver</text>
  <text start="2036.85" dur="5.55">coins don&amp;#39;t have to be big ones just you</text>
  <text start="2039.1" dur="6.84">know there&amp;#39;s fractional whatever yeah</text>
  <text start="2042.4" dur="5.94">that&amp;#39;s if this is what we should know</text>
  <text start="2045.94" dur="5.13">this in kindergarten we should teach</text>
  <text start="2048.34" dur="5.13">this in grade school but of course if</text>
  <text start="2051.07" dur="6.18">they did then they couldn&amp;#39;t get away</text>
  <text start="2053.47" dur="6.6">with it and that&amp;#39;s why less and less of</text>
  <text start="2057.25" dur="4.919">it was taught over time so yeah we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2060.07" dur="5.28">really we don&amp;#39;t get into that I thought</text>
  <text start="2062.169" dur="4.561">my spelling tensional you young really</text>
  <text start="2065.35" dur="3.62">liked the interview I did yesterday</text>
  <text start="2066.73" dur="5.22">with Alex Newman from the new American</text>
  <text start="2068.97" dur="5.98">magazine but we went and he&amp;#39;s kind of an</text>
  <text start="2071.95" dur="5.88">educator and other he does more economic</text>
  <text start="2074.95" dur="5.13">stuff and I think advanced economics I</text>
  <text start="2077.83" dur="5.13">guess high schoolers but you know he</text>
  <text start="2080.08" dur="5.16">nannies a writer but we went in depth</text>
  <text start="2082.96" dur="3.719">into the history of the education system</text>
  <text start="2085.24" dur="3.57">and how they&amp;#39;ve dumbed it down on</text>
  <text start="2086.679" dur="3.72">purpose throughout history to make</text>
  <text start="2088.81" dur="3.92">people more dependent to make people</text>
  <text start="2090.399" dur="5.431">more ignorant and no government</text>
  <text start="2092.73" dur="6.55">government incentive education so be a</text>
  <text start="2095.83" dur="6.21">good servant be a good citizen be a good</text>
  <text start="2099.28" dur="5.07">slave in other words rather than</text>
  <text start="2102.04" dur="3.93">parental incentive which is let me give</text>
  <text start="2104.35" dur="3.21">this kid the best chance that they could</text>
  <text start="2105.97" dur="4.26">ever have in their life better chance</text>
  <text start="2107.56" dur="4.799">than I had you know I I made the comment</text>
  <text start="2110.23" dur="3.99">our kids should be smarter than us with</text>
  <text start="2112.359" dur="3.931">all the new information available they</text>
  <text start="2114.22" dur="3.12">should be smarter than us they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="2116.29" dur="3.569">out of high school and they can barely</text>
  <text start="2117.34" dur="3.87">speak English they can&amp;#39;t read it&amp;#39;s bad</text>
  <text start="2119.859" dur="5.341">they don&amp;#39;t know how to interact</text>
  <text start="2121.21" dur="6.24">yeah and it&amp;#39;s a conquer I mean it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2125.2" dur="4.02">whole lot easier yeah if people are</text>
  <text start="2127.45" dur="4.56">disconnected and if families are</text>
  <text start="2129.22" dur="4.8">disjointed and disconnected and you make</text>
  <text start="2132.01" dur="3.66">you make a good comment</text>
  <text start="2134.02" dur="4.92">about how they don&amp;#39;t know how to connect</text>
  <text start="2135.67" dur="5.37">and stuff that leads to a very weak ego</text>
  <text start="2138.94" dur="4.38">and that leads to a lot of the the hurt</text>
  <text start="2141.04" dur="4.74">feelings they can&amp;#39;t take disagreement</text>
  <text start="2143.32" dur="4.32">the my generation the Millennials</text>
  <text start="2145.78" dur="3.839">largely suffer from this you know</text>
  <text start="2147.64" dur="2.61">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re very even violent when</text>
  <text start="2149.619" dur="2.491">opposed</text>
  <text start="2150.25" dur="5.13">they don&amp;#39;t understand today things like</text>
  <text start="2152.11" dur="5.13">that so I try to distance myself from</text>
  <text start="2155.38" dur="6.51">the rest of the Millennials but yeah</text>
  <text start="2157.24" dur="7.68">it&amp;#39;s gotten bad you know honestly I mean</text>
  <text start="2161.89" dur="5.7">anybody that is listening to this or</text>
  <text start="2164.92" dur="5.19">that listens to our YouTube if they try</text>
  <text start="2167.59" dur="4.38">and talk to somebody else about it a lot</text>
  <text start="2170.11" dur="4.86">of times they&amp;#39;ll get pushback they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2171.97" dur="6.39">want to hear it you know what we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2174.97" dur="6.54">really we may distance ourselves from a</text>
  <text start="2178.36" dur="7.77">topic but you see when this whole system</text>
  <text start="2181.51" dur="8.67">breaks open everybody&amp;#39;s gonna know what</text>
  <text start="2186.13" dur="5.97">the truth is so my feeling is is that</text>
  <text start="2190.18" dur="4.439">those Millennials they&amp;#39;re gonna have a</text>
  <text start="2192.1" dur="4.92">lot to learn but it&amp;#39;s the same thing I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2194.619" dur="5.611">in the baby boomer generation it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2197.02" dur="5.76">same thing in my generation because hey</text>
  <text start="2200.23" dur="5.129">a lot of people you know it was a</text>
  <text start="2202.78" dur="4.68">different kind of economy and they still</text>
  <text start="2205.359" dur="5.851">think that this is where we&amp;#39;re at well</text>
  <text start="2207.46" dur="6.51">we&amp;#39;re not there at all and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2211.21" dur="7.56">need us more they&amp;#39;re gonna need us a lot</text>
  <text start="2213.97" dur="7.11">and so I agree I keep my doors I keep my</text>
  <text start="2218.77" dur="8.48">doors open well I don&amp;#39;t actually keep my</text>
  <text start="2221.08" dur="9.12">doors open but philosophical way yeah</text>
  <text start="2227.25" dur="6.46">because I think that those that are not</text>
  <text start="2230.2" dur="6.63">attuned and not aware need that love in</text>
  <text start="2233.71" dur="5.37">that care and maybe that&amp;#39;s when we</text>
  <text start="2236.83" dur="4.86">really need to build the community to</text>
  <text start="2239.08" dur="6.75">maybe it&amp;#39;s when people become aware if</text>
  <text start="2241.69" dur="7.41">we&amp;#39;re open that bigger community and</text>
  <text start="2245.83" dur="5.039">maybe make a difference do you think in</text>
  <text start="2249.1" dur="4.32">your experience with with kind of the</text>
  <text start="2250.869" dur="4.141">the more woke crowd the more aware crowd</text>
  <text start="2253.42" dur="3.12">do you think that there&amp;#39;s kind of more</text>
  <text start="2255.01" dur="3.03">of a prevailing attitude of save</text>
  <text start="2256.54" dur="4.53">ourselves and just let the world burn</text>
  <text start="2258.04" dur="5.579">and not try to help the world I was on</text>
  <text start="2261.07" dur="4.41">one at one point I was very just</text>
  <text start="2263.619" dur="3.751">nihilistic and I had kind of given up</text>
  <text start="2265.48" dur="3.45">and I just wanted to escape you know</text>
  <text start="2267.37" dur="3.12">when I was a younger guy and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2268.93" dur="2.88">change for me especially since I had a</text>
  <text start="2270.49" dur="3.24">daughter because I see everything is</text>
  <text start="2271.81" dur="4.23">connected and what world are we leaving</text>
  <text start="2273.73" dur="4.26">for them and you know but at one point</text>
  <text start="2276.04" dur="4.41">it was just how do I get out of this I</text>
  <text start="2277.99" dur="6.36">see it coming no one listens and no one</text>
  <text start="2280.45" dur="8.13">wants to be helped you know well you</text>
  <text start="2284.35" dur="7.56">know it&amp;#39;s discouraging but what I have</text>
  <text start="2288.58" dur="5.7">personally experienced is that there is</text>
  <text start="2291.91" dur="5.04">also first of all there&amp;#39;s a tremendous</text>
  <text start="2294.28" dur="4.47">amount of unease I don&amp;#39;t care whether</text>
  <text start="2296.95" dur="4.05">you believe what we talk about whether</text>
  <text start="2298.75" dur="6.51">you don&amp;#39;t everybody feels uncomfortable</text>
  <text start="2301" dur="8.34">there&amp;#39;s like that that energy yeah but</text>
  <text start="2305.26" dur="7.23">like when I started fantasy farm and I</text>
  <text start="2309.34" dur="4.8">started in 2010 and I was kind of trying</text>
  <text start="2312.49" dur="4.41">to figure this out because I wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="2314.14" dur="6.08">gardener wasn&amp;#39;t a farmer and then I got</text>
  <text start="2316.9" dur="7.32">introduced to aquaponics into like this</text>
  <text start="2320.22" dur="7.99">community group of people that came</text>
  <text start="2324.22" dur="6.42">together I think when in 2013 that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2328.21" dur="5.87">when I installed most of my trees and</text>
  <text start="2330.64" dur="6.69">did this huge experiment but I had like</text>
  <text start="2334.08" dur="8.68">52 people or see how think it was 52</text>
  <text start="2337.33" dur="7.35">people volunteered in July in Arizona</text>
  <text start="2342.76" dur="5.19">which is insanity</text>
  <text start="2344.68" dur="8.28">really hunt come to my house and dig</text>
  <text start="2347.95" dur="9.21">holes and build boxes and and put in</text>
  <text start="2352.96" dur="8.4">ponds and to do just massive physical</text>
  <text start="2357.16" dur="6.3">labor volunteered to do it yeah and then</text>
  <text start="2361.36" dur="5.22">everybody goes together to another place</text>
  <text start="2363.46" dur="5.4">of volunteers kind of harkening back to</text>
  <text start="2366.58" dur="5.9">how it used to be with a barn raising</text>
  <text start="2368.86" dur="7.62">where the community gets together and</text>
  <text start="2372.48" dur="6.76">all I really had to do is feed them you</text>
  <text start="2376.48" dur="5.49">know and volunteer my time so you pay it</text>
  <text start="2379.24" dur="5.22">forward so on the one hand we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="2381.97" dur="6.3">this but on the other hand I&amp;#39;m seeing</text>
  <text start="2384.46" dur="6.45">that and that community and coming</text>
  <text start="2388.27" dur="5.34">together and helping each other for</text>
  <text start="2390.91" dur="6.51">nothing other than because we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="2393.61" dur="6.72">part of the same community mm-hmm I also</text>
  <text start="2397.42" dur="3.56">see that part growing too so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2400.33" dur="4.53">always a</text>
  <text start="2400.98" dur="6.13">and yeah you know and so yeah I&amp;#39;m seeing</text>
  <text start="2404.86" dur="6.42">that grow a lot and I&amp;#39;m hearing that</text>
  <text start="2407.11" dur="6.6">grow a lot and I hope I&amp;#39;ve done the same</text>
  <text start="2411.28" dur="4.26">thing I&amp;#39;m part of a food co-op you made</text>
  <text start="2413.71" dur="3.63">me think of like the Amish style barn</text>
  <text start="2415.54" dur="4.97">raisings and then you said barn raisings</text>
  <text start="2417.34" dur="6.27">so yeah that kind of localized</text>
  <text start="2420.51" dur="4.51">government of yourself structure people</text>
  <text start="2423.61" dur="2.94">who know each other and actually have</text>
  <text start="2425.02" dur="3">kind of an incentive to help each other</text>
  <text start="2426.55" dur="3.69">because they&amp;#39;re all part of the same</text>
  <text start="2428.02" dur="5.7">group that&amp;#39;s as bad as big as you want</text>
  <text start="2430.24" dur="6.09">coming to get at max because that&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="2433.72" dur="4.71">least the start of it yeah and then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2436.33" dur="4.59">really good government can grow from</text>
  <text start="2438.43" dur="5.1">that but that there is some</text>
  <text start="2440.92" dur="6">accountability that there is some level</text>
  <text start="2443.53" dur="6.69">of responsibility that&amp;#39;s what gold does</text>
  <text start="2446.92" dur="6.18">gold and silver mean that a government</text>
  <text start="2450.22" dur="5.25">has to be fiscally responsible because</text>
  <text start="2453.1" dur="5.82">whose money are they actually spending</text>
  <text start="2455.47" dur="6.47">their spending yours in mind mm-hmm but</text>
  <text start="2458.92" dur="7.59">governments are not fiscally responsible</text>
  <text start="2461.94" dur="10.36">they really it appears to me much of the</text>
  <text start="2466.51" dur="8.37">time that we are we&amp;#39;re the product box</text>
  <text start="2472.3" dur="5.55">of cereal or whatever right and what</text>
  <text start="2474.88" dur="6.33">they get from you rather than their</text>
  <text start="2477.85" dur="7.62">first job was to serve and that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2481.21" dur="5.55">morphed oh I kind of maybe it&amp;#39;s elitist</text>
  <text start="2485.47" dur="3.27">but I kind of like the idea that only</text>
  <text start="2486.76" dur="3.96">property owners should vote just because</text>
  <text start="2488.74" dur="4.08">they have the actual incentive and that</text>
  <text start="2490.72" dur="4.74">kind of sets aside some of the socialist</text>
  <text start="2492.82" dur="6.03">things it has its flaws but I like to</text>
  <text start="2495.46" dur="5.48">get people the example yeah it&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="2498.85" dur="4.56">I like to give people the example that</text>
  <text start="2500.94" dur="4.21">if you were to give like your 5 or your</text>
  <text start="2503.41" dur="4.13">10 year old a credit card and just say</text>
  <text start="2505.15" dur="5.31">whatever you want have fun with it and</text>
  <text start="2507.54" dur="5.29">then would you be able to sustain that 5</text>
  <text start="2510.46" dur="8.19">10 years into it after they&amp;#39;ve just went</text>
  <text start="2512.83" dur="7.29">crazy on the internet way yeah so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2518.65" dur="6.15">exactly what we&amp;#39;re asking the government</text>
  <text start="2520.12" dur="6.66">to do yeah hold yourself accountable be</text>
  <text start="2524.8" dur="3.96">accountable be responsible with this</text>
  <text start="2526.78" dur="4.17">unlimited money credit card that you can</text>
  <text start="2528.76" dur="3.57">print and throw it off to future</text>
  <text start="2530.95" dur="2.9">generations because of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2532.33" dur="2.63">not interested in</text>
  <text start="2533.85" dur="2.88">they won&amp;#39;t have to deal with the problem</text>
  <text start="2534.96" dur="4.32">in their term it&amp;#39;ll be kicked down the</text>
  <text start="2536.73" dur="6.03">road to someone else I don&amp;#39;t think the</text>
  <text start="2539.28" dur="6.63">kicking is has ability to keep going</text>
  <text start="2542.76" dur="6.24">though because really what they have in</text>
  <text start="2545.91" dur="6.36">the system is the value of the currency</text>
  <text start="2549" dur="6.66">and then the interest rates to regulate</text>
  <text start="2552.27" dur="6">the speed of the inflation and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2555.66" dur="6.51">the problem there&amp;#39;s no value left in the</text>
  <text start="2558.27" dur="6.84">currency and you&amp;#39;ve got 90 percent of</text>
  <text start="2562.17" dur="7.5">the world anchored somewhere near zero</text>
  <text start="2565.11" dur="6.78">interest rates and while that worked for</text>
  <text start="2569.67" dur="4.8">a minute or two so they could grow a</text>
  <text start="2571.89" dur="4.32">whole lot more debt but keep the service</text>
  <text start="2574.47" dur="6.09">payments the same because interest rates</text>
  <text start="2576.21" dur="8.31">are zero it&amp;#39;s not true anymore and we</text>
  <text start="2580.56" dur="5.97">have the short-termism so you know might</text>
  <text start="2584.52" dur="4.11">have been smart for them when we are at</text>
  <text start="2586.53" dur="4.5">or somewhere near zero to lock in</text>
  <text start="2588.63" dur="3.84">hundred your your bonds and I think</text>
  <text start="2591.03" dur="4.5">there are a few of them that have been</text>

  <text start="2613.26" dur="9.39">based disappears they go away by the end</text>
  <text start="2617.64" dur="7.67">of 2021 so all of these contracts</text>
  <text start="2622.65" dur="6.92">anything that matures after that date</text>
  <text start="2625.31" dur="8.62">has to be reset never been done before</text>

  <text start="2641.6" dur="8.49">you know Deutsche Bank is such a</text>
  <text start="2645.72" dur="7.56">dangerous Bank but truthfully any global</text>
  <text start="2650.09" dur="7.33">Universal Bank that&amp;#39;s their title</text>
  <text start="2653.28" dur="7.05">global Universal that means that they</text>
  <text start="2657.42" dur="8.37">have their tentacles where they touch</text>
  <text start="2660.33" dur="7.45">they&amp;#39;re connected to every single fiat</text>

  <text start="2677.59" dur="5.82">Deutsche Bank is a zombie Bank mmm</text>
  <text start="2680.38" dur="4.5">zombie Bank by their own admission even</text>
  <text start="2683.41" dur="4.26">though they haven&amp;#39;t said where is Omni</text>
  <text start="2684.88" dur="7.5">Bank but what they did say was that</text>
  <text start="2687.67" dur="8.82">their leverage ratio was I think 3.8</text>
  <text start="2692.38" dur="6.12">percent and they had losses last year</text>
  <text start="2696.49" dur="5.88">according to their financial report I</text>
  <text start="2698.5" dur="6.15">believe that it was 7 percent which</text>
  <text start="2702.37" dur="7.32">means they&amp;#39;re insolvent by their own</text>
  <text start="2704.65" dur="8.28">financial records they are insolvent ok</text>
  <text start="2709.69" dur="5.25">so look at their stock price yeah they</text>
  <text start="2712.93" dur="3.3">seem to be in a lot of trouble and I</text>
  <text start="2714.94" dur="3.66">know that they&amp;#39;re connected to so many</text>
  <text start="2716.23" dur="6.09">other huge names I mean huge names will</text>
  <text start="2718.6" dur="4.29">go down with that and it is - yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="2722.32" dur="3.06">of course</text>
  <text start="2722.89" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re completely and I know people</text>
  <text start="2725.38" dur="3.48">don&amp;#39;t like when I use this term but</text>
  <text start="2726.88" dur="5.37">there is no better term for it</text>
  <text start="2728.86" dur="7.07">these banks and these non banks these</text>
  <text start="2732.25" dur="6.36">shadow banks so insurance companies just</text>
  <text start="2735.93" dur="5.17">mortgage companies companies that the</text>
  <text start="2738.61" dur="4.02">only difference between or well not the</text>
  <text start="2741.1" dur="3.75">only difference but the key difference</text>
  <text start="2742.63" dur="4.56">between a bank and a shadow bank is a</text>
  <text start="2744.85" dur="6.53">shadow bank does a lot that the banks do</text>
  <text start="2747.19" dur="7.53">they just don&amp;#39;t have deposits to bail in</text>
  <text start="2751.38" dur="6.94">ok and they&amp;#39;re and they&amp;#39;re not under the</text>
  <text start="2754.72" dur="6.75">same kind of regulation or scrutiny so</text>
  <text start="2758.32" dur="6.48">we&amp;#39;re in maybe say like in leveraged</text>
  <text start="2761.47" dur="5.1">loans which are highly risky loans you</text>
  <text start="2764.8" dur="3.24">know maybe the regular banks aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2766.57" dur="4.44">making as many of them but the shadow</text>
  <text start="2768.04" dur="6.63">banks are and they&amp;#39;re not regulated so</text>
  <text start="2771.01" dur="6.09">when that erupts and there I believe a</text>
  <text start="2774.67" dur="4.83">report that I recently read and was when</text>
  <text start="2777.1" dur="4.56">in one of my recent videos the</text>
  <text start="2779.5" dur="6.42">connection between the shadow banks and</text>
  <text start="2781.66" dur="8.76">the banks on the derivatives is seven</text>
  <text start="2785.92" dur="6.42">times the global GDP that&amp;#39;s just that</text>
  <text start="2790.42" dur="5.1">one little teeny connection that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2792.34" dur="6.78">all of it it&amp;#39;s one little teeny</text>
  <text start="2795.52" dur="5.67">connection in nominal terms which means</text>
  <text start="2799.12" dur="6.209">who really knows how big that</text>
  <text start="2801.19" dur="6.57">mm-hmm okay so I want to talk about the</text>
  <text start="2805.329" dur="4.02">interest rate and how that&amp;#39;s gonna you</text>
  <text start="2807.76" dur="2.73">know that the small incremental ism that</text>
  <text start="2809.349" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re doing and the effect that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2810.49" dur="6.629">going to have on all sorts of debt</text>
  <text start="2813.099" dur="6.48">instruments everything else not yeah and</text>
  <text start="2817.119" dur="5.431">I want to talk kind of about the phony</text>
  <text start="2819.579" dur="4.591">economy that they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2822.55" dur="3.569">masquerading that things have been well</text>
  <text start="2824.17" dur="3.96">and least until October everything is</text>
  <text start="2826.119" dur="4.441">doing well everything is going great</text>
  <text start="2828.13" dur="4.29">you know it&amp;#39;s all moving up from here</text>
  <text start="2830.56" dur="4.259">and just this general positivity and</text>
  <text start="2832.42" dur="6.21">they did a 1:1 poll I don&amp;#39;t remember the</text>
  <text start="2834.819" dur="5.341">name of it like only 13% of people will</text>
  <text start="2838.63" dur="3.63">I think it was we&amp;#39;re saying it was</text>
  <text start="2840.16" dur="3.81">really low as around 10 13 percent we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2842.26" dur="4.859">saying that the economy was their first</text>
  <text start="2843.97" dur="4.47">top interests politically which means</text>
  <text start="2847.119" dur="4.441">they&amp;#39;re everybody&amp;#39;s really comfortable</text>
  <text start="2848.44" dur="4.2">and confident what do you know where</text>
  <text start="2851.56" dur="4.89">they didn&amp;#39;t respond</text>
  <text start="2852.64" dur="7.89">yeah yeah right but there&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>
  <text start="2856.45" dur="9.629">apathy as Trust is lost there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="2860.53" dur="8.28">more apathy and you know we my personal</text>
  <text start="2866.079" dur="6.391">feeling is when something gets so</text>
  <text start="2868.81" dur="5.37">complicated then you cannot figure it</text>
  <text start="2872.47" dur="4.92">out there&amp;#39;s a reason why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2874.18" dur="5.76">complicated for for financial</text>
  <text start="2877.39" dur="6.06">institutions financial engineering and</text>
  <text start="2879.94" dur="5.82">governments central banks they actually</text>
  <text start="2883.45" dur="5.909">have said in some of their documentation</text>
  <text start="2885.76" dur="8.63">if people do not understand it they</text>
  <text start="2889.359" dur="7.771">don&amp;#39;t ask questions so you know</text>
  <text start="2894.39" dur="7.51">truthfully money should be actually</text>
  <text start="2897.13" dur="7.59">quite simple you work you get paid money</text>
  <text start="2901.9" dur="5.969">that&amp;#39;s based on labor and savings and</text>
  <text start="2904.72" dur="5.16">you can accumulate it but the system is</text>
  <text start="2907.869" dur="4.621">way more complicated than that because</text>
  <text start="2909.88" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s based on constantly compounding</text>
  <text start="2912.49" dur="5.369">debt and the next system that they have</text>
  <text start="2914.44" dur="5.97">us going into you have to be probably a</text>
  <text start="2917.859" dur="5.181">specific kind of engineer in order to</text>
  <text start="2920.41" dur="5.97">understand this oh yeah I feel comfy</text>
  <text start="2923.04" dur="6.069">yeah well then it&amp;#39;s that they make you</text>
  <text start="2926.38" dur="5.01">too complicated for most people and then</text>
  <text start="2929.109" dur="5.551">that almost guarantees there&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="2931.39" dur="5.1">an elite class of 1% or 10%</text>
  <text start="2934.66" dur="3.54">whatever that take advantage of the</text>
  <text start="2936.49" dur="4.17">system and don&amp;#39;t necessarily get there</text>
  <text start="2938.2" dur="5.19">through hard work or earning it they get</text>
  <text start="2940.66" dur="5.129">the right corruption but you can also</text>
  <text start="2943.39" dur="5.1">understand why people would not be</text>
  <text start="2945.789" dur="5.73">interested in it because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2948.49" dur="5.22">really understand or see how it relates</text>
  <text start="2951.519" dur="4.5">to them and then that takes us back to</text>
  <text start="2953.71" dur="5.01">the value piece if people really were</text>
  <text start="2956.019" dur="5.971">clear on what their value is and and</text>
  <text start="2958.72" dur="6.149">it&amp;#39;s not about a set of numbers right</text>
  <text start="2961.99" dur="5.069">because you just blinded by numbers look</text>
  <text start="2964.869" dur="4.98">at this the stock market went up to new</text>
  <text start="2967.059" dur="3.391">highs but yet the value on which it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2969.849" dur="3.031">based</text>
  <text start="2970.45" dur="4.159">has plummeted to new lows guess which</text>
  <text start="2972.88" dur="4.08">wins at the end of the day</text>
  <text start="2974.609" dur="4.541">wouldn&amp;#39;t it be interesting if every time</text>
  <text start="2976.96" dur="3.809">you saw a dollar denominated number or</text>
  <text start="2979.15" dur="3.54">like your bank account your net worth or</text>
  <text start="2980.769" dur="4.05">anything right next to it was a</text>
  <text start="2982.69" dur="4.109">percentage base or a number based on</text>
  <text start="2984.819" dur="3.631">like the top ten items that you buy and</text>
  <text start="2986.799" dur="5.01">what that will get you in today&amp;#39;s terms</text>
  <text start="2988.45" dur="5.49">people listening oh yeah that would be</text>
  <text start="2991.809" dur="3.78">okay I don&amp;#39;t want to take up too much</text>
  <text start="2993.94" dur="3">more your time do you mind talking maybe</text>
  <text start="2995.589" dur="4.051">a little bit about the the missing</text>
  <text start="2996.94" dur="5.069">thirty trillion and what goldman sachs</text>
  <text start="2999.64" dur="3.689">is doing with all of this ups and downs</text>
  <text start="3002.009" dur="3.421">and kind of what their moves have been</text>
  <text start="3003.329" dur="3.121">well I&amp;#39;m not really sure what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3005.43" dur="2.879">talking about</text>
  <text start="3006.45" dur="4.5">so it may not be a topic that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3008.309" dur="4.441">familiar with but you know I mean I</text>
  <text start="3010.95" dur="5.639">don&amp;#39;t know everything in the world oh</text>
  <text start="3012.75" dur="6.39">yeah yeah yeah there&amp;#39;s been there was</text>
  <text start="3016.589" dur="4.17">some reports and this is not mainstream</text>
  <text start="3019.14" dur="3.51">narrative yet this is more like truth or</text>
  <text start="3020.759" dur="3.57">talk but there&amp;#39;s been a lot of people</text>
  <text start="3022.65" dur="4.08">saying that thirty trillion went missing</text>
  <text start="3024.329" dur="4.891">from the Pentagon I think it was the</text>
  <text start="3026.73" dur="6.029">Celerio or something like that I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3029.22" dur="5.309">quite who sourced that yeah I mean the</text>
  <text start="3032.759" dur="4.171">truth of the matter is is that they</text>
  <text start="3034.529" dur="4.56">can&amp;#39;t reconcile those books not the</text>
  <text start="3036.93" dur="4.349">Pentagon yeah and so all they keep doing</text>
  <text start="3039.089" dur="4.161">is throwing more and more money thirty</text>
  <text start="3041.279" dur="5.221">trillion I&amp;#39;ll bet it&amp;#39;s more than that</text>
  <text start="3043.25" dur="5.89">probably yeah you know ever figure that</text>
  <text start="3046.5" dur="4.5">out and then yeah and right before 9/11</text>
  <text start="3049.14" dur="3.6">was that how many there was a couple</text>
  <text start="3051" dur="3.119">trillion that went missing now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3052.74" dur="3.569">remember the number but like the day</text>
  <text start="3054.119" dur="4.5">before so there&amp;#39;s always there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="3056.309" dur="5.01">something there is always that and there</text>
  <text start="3058.619" dur="4.98">was a whole bunch of gold including the</text>
  <text start="3061.319" dur="5.191">1933 coin that was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="3063.599" dur="5.551">auctioned off that was held in the base</text>
  <text start="3066.51" dur="5.49">the twin towers and yet was magically</text>
  <text start="3069.15" dur="5.49">moved I think a week or two before the</text>
  <text start="3072" dur="5.22">attack before 9/11 why did they suddenly</text>
  <text start="3074.64" dur="6.27">move it the auction wasn&amp;#39;t happening yet</text>
  <text start="3077.22" dur="6.99">mm-hmm so there are a lot of things that</text>
  <text start="3080.91" dur="6.15">we can&amp;#39;t explain and if I can&amp;#39;t prove</text>
  <text start="3084.21" dur="4.92">that I know well okay so what about</text>
  <text start="3087.06" dur="3.93">goldman sachs is there any numbers</text>
  <text start="3089.13" dur="3.72">coming out from there anything that we</text>
  <text start="3090.99" dur="3">can find in the public data that kind of</text>
  <text start="3092.85" dur="2.67">gives us an idea of what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="3093.99" dur="5.76">what they think is gonna happen and</text>
  <text start="3095.52" dur="9.38">their insider moves well the fact that</text>

  <text start="3223.579" dur="5.79">seeing on the markets with him</text>
  <text start="3225.17" dur="7.139">absolutely smashing through that 200-day</text>

  <text start="3232.309" dur="4.201">the only other times when they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="3233.809" dur="4.56">that have been times when the powers</text>

  <text start="3242.599" dur="6.031">saying that they can&amp;#39;t figure out some</text>
  <text start="3245.51" dur="4.559">way to jerry-rig it higher absolutely a</text>
  <text start="3248.63" dur="5.28">hundred percent the damage has been</text>
  <text start="3250.069" dur="5.611">majorly done and they&amp;#39;re out well I</text>
  <text start="3253.91" dur="6.77">can&amp;#39;t say they&amp;#39;re absolutely a de belitz</text>
  <text start="3255.68" dur="8.849">I can&amp;#39;t see any more bullets so we have</text>
  <text start="3260.68" dur="7.109">what they come up with but I would like</text>
  <text start="3264.529" dur="6.03">to say that really for ITM trading</text>
  <text start="3267.789" dur="5.651">everything we do here is with the</text>
  <text start="3270.559" dur="4.77">physical gold and silver that we shipped</text>
  <text start="3273.44" dur="4.349">to you unless of course you do it inside</text>
  <text start="3275.329" dur="4.381">of an IRA and then it&amp;#39;s still physical</text>
  <text start="3277.789" dur="5.01">but you don&amp;#39;t have possession of it</text>
  <text start="3279.71" dur="6.569">but the reason why we do that is because</text>
  <text start="3282.799" dur="5.52">of what is coming if all that wealth is</text>
  <text start="3286.279" dur="4.711">held in the system and the system shuts</text>
  <text start="3288.319" dur="5.97">down that pretty piece of paper that</text>
  <text start="3290.99" dur="6.42">says you have X Y Z in terms of dollars</text>
  <text start="3294.289" dur="4.82">or what have you will not do anything if</text>
  <text start="3297.41" dur="6.08">you need to buy a pint of strawberries</text>
  <text start="3299.109" dur="8.651">or put a gallon of gas in your car and</text>
  <text start="3303.49" dur="7.24">in a reset what it&amp;#39;s really all about is</text>
  <text start="3307.76" dur="5.43">absolute wealth transfer but what</text>
  <text start="3310.73" dur="7.109">everybody really needs to understand is</text>
  <text start="3313.19" dur="8.369">that Wall Street&amp;#39;s products guarantee</text>
  <text start="3317.839" dur="7.47">that they&amp;#39;re really like a black hole</text>
  <text start="3321.559" dur="6.181">excuse me so when these markets implode</text>
  <text start="3325.309" dur="5.01">the next time you&amp;#39;re not getting out I</text>
  <text start="3327.74" dur="5.64">mean it really is just that simple and</text>
  <text start="3330.319" dur="5.701">then when you come</text>
  <text start="3333.38" dur="8.7">all that with how that&amp;#39;s always happened</text>
  <text start="3336.02" dur="7.56">excuse me all of a sudden I got a tickle</text>
  <text start="3342.08" dur="4.95">in my throat I&amp;#39;m sorry that happens to</text>
  <text start="3343.58" dur="9.36">me all the time I talk a lot on YouTube</text>
  <text start="3347.03" dur="8.22">sites but you know what what I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="3352.94" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;ve been studying currency since 87</text>
  <text start="3355.25" dur="4.26">and I just looked for repeatable</text>
  <text start="3357.5" dur="5.19">patterns and that&amp;#39;s a lot of what I try</text>
  <text start="3359.51" dur="5.67">to teach on our YouTube channel which is</text>

  <text start="3365.18" dur="5.49">my name Lynette Zhang they&amp;#39;ll probably</text>
  <text start="3366.83" dur="6.93">come up but if you can recognize the</text>
  <text start="3370.67" dur="5.4">patterns then you can get into a proper</text>
  <text start="3373.76" dur="5.13">position to take advantage of the</text>
  <text start="3376.07" dur="5.88">inevitable and I created a strategy</text>
  <text start="3378.89" dur="5.61">based upon those repeatable patterns and</text>
  <text start="3381.95" dur="6.48">that&amp;#39;s what we do here we help you</text>
  <text start="3384.5" dur="6">execute that strategy as to what you</text>
  <text start="3388.43" dur="4.11">should what you should position into the</text>
  <text start="3390.5" dur="4.49">kind of gold and silver that you should</text>
  <text start="3392.54" dur="5.22">position into based upon your goals and</text>
  <text start="3394.99" dur="5.68">your circumstances and what you have to</text>
  <text start="3397.76" dur="6.78">work with and your comfort level but</text>
  <text start="3400.67" dur="6.06">it&amp;#39;s also through the trend cycle this</text>
  <text start="3404.54" dur="4.44">is a relationship that we hold quite</text>

  <text start="3465.35" dur="4.41">this</text>
  <text start="3466.82" dur="4.47">I wanted to you bring a very clear value</text>
  <text start="3469.76" dur="3.45">to folks a lot of people ask me the</text>
  <text start="3471.29" dur="5.67">question like what do I do with my</text>
  <text start="3473.21" dur="6.06">retirement my 401k you know mutual funds</text>
  <text start="3476.96" dur="3.6">all of that stuff and I I never mess</text>
  <text start="3479.27" dur="2.94">with them because I realize this was a</text>
  <text start="3480.56" dur="3.75">really great market to begin with but</text>
  <text start="3482.21" dur="4.05">for people who have those questions like</text>
  <text start="3484.31" dur="3.99">you can help them maybe even switch over</text>
  <text start="3486.26" dur="4.29">to like a self-directed IRA and then buy</text>
  <text start="3488.3" dur="5.49">physical metals things like that right</text>
  <text start="3490.55" dur="5.34">absolutely but it&amp;#39;s but it&amp;#39;s even more</text>
  <text start="3493.79" dur="4.56">than that because there are certainly</text>
  <text start="3495.89" dur="4.68">people that have a hard time</text>
  <text start="3498.35" dur="5.04">understanding and believing that the</text>
  <text start="3500.57" dur="5.28">system is going to though they can kind</text>
  <text start="3503.39" dur="4.86">of get a crash but they can&amp;#39;t really get</text>
  <text start="3505.85" dur="5.97">that it&amp;#39;s going away that is mal you</text>
  <text start="3508.25" dur="7.31">could go to basically zero so for those</text>
  <text start="3511.82" dur="7.89">it&amp;#39;s even to have a properly diversified</text>
  <text start="3515.56" dur="6.73">portfolio Wall Street wants you to think</text>
  <text start="3519.71" dur="4.38">that diversification is between bonds</text>
  <text start="3522.29" dur="3.9">and annuities and stocks and mutual</text>
  <text start="3524.09" dur="4.35">funds it needs yes and all of these</text>
  <text start="3526.19" dur="5.82">products but those are a hundred percent</text>
  <text start="3528.44" dur="6.44">all fiat so you&amp;#39;re not diversified at</text>
  <text start="3532.01" dur="6.09">all you have all your eggs in one basket</text>
  <text start="3534.88" dur="7.81">having some physical gold and silver</text>
  <text start="3538.1" dur="7.65">some tangibles some real assets outside</text>
  <text start="3542.69" dur="6.21">of the system to balance that out is</text>
  <text start="3545.75" dur="5.61">also critical for those that still have</text>
  <text start="3548.9" dur="4.5">a level of comfort in the markets I I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3551.36" dur="4.68">not one I was a stock broker I was a</text>

  <text start="3561.71" dur="4.47">that crap however I&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="3564.38" dur="3.72">people shouldn&amp;#39;t because everybody&amp;#39;s got</text>

  <text start="3575.87" dur="6.02">help you calculate out based upon</text>
  <text start="3578.12" dur="8.85">historical norms to calculate out what</text>
  <text start="3581.89" dur="8.44">you need to support those goals even if</text>
  <text start="3586.97" dur="5.49">some of those goals are keeping it in</text>
  <text start="3590.33" dur="3.36">the system and and if you have a 403b</text>
  <text start="3592.46" dur="2.4">and you&amp;#39;re still working there you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3593.69" dur="3.15">not going to be able to get it out</text>
  <text start="3594.86" dur="5.01">anyway so there are some circumstances</text>
  <text start="3596.84" dur="3.81">that are really not a person&amp;#39;s choice</text>
  <text start="3599.87" dur="3.05">but they</text>
  <text start="3600.65" dur="4.98">need to know how to protect that wealth</text>

  <text start="3614.029" dur="3.691">fine for you but if you want to be above</text>
  <text start="3615.5" dur="4.64">average it&amp;#39;s not about so much</text>

  <text start="3627.049" dur="3.24">try to just buy all of these different</text>
  <text start="3628.609" dur="3.271">things and I know that kind of flies in</text>
  <text start="3630.289" dur="3.361">the face of traditional wisdom and</text>
  <text start="3631.88" dur="3.659">people often have a hard time with that</text>
  <text start="3633.65" dur="3">but when you&amp;#39;re in all of these</text>
  <text start="3635.539" dur="3.06">different stocks and things that you</text>
  <text start="3636.65" dur="5.389">don&amp;#39;t even understand you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3638.599" dur="6.18">probably just doing badly in many areas</text>
  <text start="3642.039" dur="4.631">actually not the individual stocks it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3644.779" dur="5.131">all of the derivative and garbage that</text>
  <text start="3646.67" dur="5.399">they now commingle with this stuff you</text>
  <text start="3649.91" dur="5.939">know and and just to kind of take that</text>
  <text start="3652.069" dur="5.49">just one step further because a lot of</text>
  <text start="3655.849" dur="4.411">people go well I don&amp;#39;t really have the</text>

  <text start="3666.74" dur="5.76">insiders are doing but I give you the</text>

  <text start="3672.5" dur="8.13">even if you are not keen on becoming a</text>
  <text start="3677.529" dur="5.56">specialist if you could just emulate</text>

  <text start="3688.7" dur="4.44">better off as well but I absolutely do</text>
  <text start="3690.98" dur="4.139">agree with them I just don&amp;#39;t see a lot</text>
  <text start="3693.14" dur="4.29">of people rushing to really understand</text>
  <text start="3695.119" dur="6.391">this stuff but it&amp;#39;s so complicated I</text>
  <text start="3697.43" dur="5.849">agree with you and you know I am NOT on</text>
  <text start="3701.51" dur="4.89">your level at all when it comes to</text>
  <text start="3703.279" dur="5.131">expertise but I feel like this month was</text>
  <text start="3706.4" dur="3.84">kind of like what happened before we</text>
  <text start="3708.41" dur="5.04">were at a pretty high peak very much</text>
  <text start="3710.24" dur="5.22">close to the dot-com bubble peak now</text>
  <text start="3713.45" dur="3.359">we&amp;#39;ve probably were past the peak and it</text>
  <text start="3715.46" dur="3.599">seems to be having trouble from here on</text>
  <text start="3716.809" dur="4.26">out combined with the the constant</text>
  <text start="3719.059" dur="4.141">interest rate Jack&amp;#39;s everything else it</text>
  <text start="3721.069" dur="3.901">could go higher but I feel like people</text>
  <text start="3723.2" dur="6.03">would be served better to to make their</text>
  <text start="3724.97" dur="7.079">decision quicker and you&amp;#39;re just what</text>
  <text start="3729.23" dur="4.91">everybody just experienced is the lack</text>
  <text start="3732.049" dur="4.881">of liquidity in these markets</text>
  <text start="3734.14" dur="5.82">the fact that there are no buyers even</text>
  <text start="3736.93" dur="6">if you listen to CNBC I cannot tell you</text>
  <text start="3739.96" dur="5.069">how many times because I listen to them</text>
  <text start="3742.93" dur="5.309">when I&amp;#39;m working or I listen to</text>
  <text start="3745.029" dur="5.04">Bloomberg and it&amp;#39;s not because I you</text>
  <text start="3748.239" dur="4.53">know I need to know what they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="3750.069" dur="5.55">about I cannot tell you how many times I</text>
  <text start="3752.769" dur="5.85">have heard them say that the buyers just</text>
  <text start="3755.619" dur="6.75">didn&amp;#39;t show up but that was the problem</text>
  <text start="3758.619" dur="5.851">the buyers just did not show up so if</text>
  <text start="3762.369" dur="3.66">you want to sell something people think</text>
  <text start="3764.47" dur="5.039">well I can just tell it whenever I want</text>
  <text start="3766.029" dur="6">not if there are no buyers yeah people</text>
  <text start="3769.509" dur="5.07">are sitting on cash right now right yes</text>
  <text start="3772.029" dur="5.401">they&amp;#39;re sitting on cash inside of a</text>
  <text start="3774.579" dur="6.96">system that&amp;#39;s severely lowered that</text>
  <text start="3777.43" dur="5.579">legally can value it good what a scary</text>
  <text start="3781.539" dur="2.881">market okay so some of my last two</text>
  <text start="3783.009" dur="4.05">questions and I kind of want to leave</text>
  <text start="3784.42" dur="4.77">this to motivate people to make a</text>
  <text start="3787.059" dur="4.5">decision and and maybe even reach out</text>
  <text start="3789.19" dur="5.25">and contact you what I think the the</text>
  <text start="3791.559" dur="5.73">real interest rate is the real inflation</text>
  <text start="3794.44" dur="5.19">rate is right now and then what I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="3797.289" dur="4.23">honestly say and everybody can kind of</text>
  <text start="3799.63" dur="5.639">check it I&amp;#39;d say we&amp;#39;re probably running</text>
  <text start="3801.519" dur="5.73">closer to 10% but John Williams had sat</text>
  <text start="3805.269" dur="5.25">at shadow stats which I haven&amp;#39;t looked</text>
  <text start="3807.249" dur="6.451">at just lately but he&amp;#39;s really brilliant</text>
  <text start="3810.519" dur="5.04">and he actually calculates that out on a</text>
  <text start="3813.7" dur="4.02">regular basis I would a hundred percent</text>
  <text start="3815.559" dur="4.05">trust whatever it was that he said you</text>
  <text start="3817.72" dur="4.47">know if it&amp;#39;s than what I just said I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3819.609" dur="5.19">adding shadow cents yeah he&amp;#39;s awesome</text>
  <text start="3822.19" dur="4.98">and this is gonna be a fun question but</text>
  <text start="3824.799" dur="4.29">compared to the average you know things</text>
  <text start="3827.17" dur="4.02">that people go into their 401ks and</text>
  <text start="3829.089" dur="3.631">there&amp;#39;s their retirement things even</text>
  <text start="3831.19" dur="4.379">with the tax advantages and everything</text>
  <text start="3832.72" dur="4.23">else how would you think or soar or</text>
  <text start="3835.569" dur="4.381">maybe you can provide some data off</text>
  <text start="3836.95" dur="5.43">memory as you can but how do you think</text>
  <text start="3839.95" dur="4.789">gold has done compared to those things</text>
  <text start="3842.38" dur="6.3">over a very long period of time</text>
  <text start="3844.739" dur="6.88">well actually gold has outperformed them</text>
  <text start="3848.68" dur="5.55">over a long period of time you know not</text>
  <text start="3851.619" dur="6.781">short that&amp;#39;s what people will look at</text>
  <text start="3854.23" dur="6.629">but yeah when you look at the purchasing</text>
  <text start="3858.4" dur="5.159">power value if you were paid in the same</text>
  <text start="3860.859" dur="5.19">amount of gold or if you had a certain</text>
  <text start="3863.559" dur="4.351">amount of gold up to this even into this</text>
  <text start="3866.049" dur="4.441">manipulated market</text>
  <text start="3867.91" dur="5.55">Gold has outperformed at all and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3870.49" dur="5.49">been all throughout history so people</text>
  <text start="3873.46" dur="4.23">who are obviously very patient and</text>
  <text start="3875.98" dur="3.42">willing to wait and outlast the</text>
  <text start="3877.69" dur="3.99">manipulation and the emotional things</text>
  <text start="3879.4" dur="5.219">that they do will have these huge</text>
  <text start="3881.68" dur="4.379">upsides and we may be about to be like</text>
  <text start="3884.619" dur="3.121">right in front of one of those now and</text>
  <text start="3886.059" dur="3.691">maybe people won&amp;#39;t have to wait as long</text>
  <text start="3887.74" dur="4.799">if they get in now I don&amp;#39;t know I think</text>
  <text start="3889.75" dur="6.569">so well we&amp;#39;re at the end of it and and</text>
  <text start="3892.539" dur="5.881">the other part that that is a little</text>
  <text start="3896.319" dur="4.161">challenging for people to understand but</text>
  <text start="3898.42" dur="5.369">it&amp;#39;s absolutely critical that you do</text>
  <text start="3900.48" dur="6.01">gold and silver do not go up because I</text>
  <text start="3903.789" dur="6.75">say it or you say it or a trader on Wall</text>
  <text start="3906.49" dur="9.48">Street says it it goes up because that</text>
  <text start="3910.539" dur="8.431">is how a reset is done they revalue the</text>
  <text start="3915.97" dur="5.399">currency that has no value against</text>
  <text start="3918.97" dur="5.22">something that is all value which is</text>
  <text start="3921.369" dur="5.161">gold and gold is all valued not because</text>
  <text start="3924.19" dur="5.52">I say it I don&amp;#39;t have that power but</text>
  <text start="3926.53" dur="7.529">simply because there is demand across</text>
  <text start="3929.71" dur="7.409">the entire economic spectrum so there is</text>
  <text start="3934.059" dur="6.211">always demand so that&amp;#39;s how governments</text>
  <text start="3937.119" dur="6.271">do it they revalue the currency or the</text>
  <text start="3940.27" dur="6">gold in relation to this currency and</text>
  <text start="3943.39" dur="7.979">then in terms of that currency gold</text>
  <text start="3946.27" dur="7.68">explodes so you know that&amp;#39;s why I can</text>
  <text start="3951.369" dur="5.781">sit here and I could say without like</text>
  <text start="3953.95" dur="6.48">even one little doubt in my mind that</text>
  <text start="3957.15" dur="6.219">the minimum value of gold right now in</text>
  <text start="3960.43" dur="4.129">terms of dollars is in excess of nine</text>
  <text start="3963.369" dur="3.811">thousand bucks</text>
  <text start="3964.559" dur="4.961">period because if they were going to do</text>
  <text start="3967.18" dur="4.08">the reset today based upon the level of</text>
  <text start="3969.52" dur="3.93">debt that&amp;#39;s out there which is how money</text>
  <text start="3971.26" dur="4.23">is created and the amount of physical</text>
  <text start="3973.45" dur="4.8">bulb that exists in the world it would</text>
  <text start="3975.49" dur="7.5">be somewhere north of nine thousand</text>
  <text start="3978.25" dur="9.69">bucks so at 1200 1300 five thousand you</text>
  <text start="3982.99" dur="8.76">know seven thousand it&amp;#39;s a bargain buy</text>
  <text start="3987.94" dur="6.869">low and then as the opportunities</text>
  <text start="3991.75" dur="4.41">present we see these patterns these are</text>
  <text start="3994.809" dur="3.24">the things I talk about all the time</text>
  <text start="3996.16" dur="3.689">that&amp;#39;s when you&amp;#39;re going to take those</text>
  <text start="3998.049" dur="3.741">gains and they&amp;#39;re going to come hurt</text>
  <text start="3999.849" dur="5.781">them into income pretty</text>
  <text start="4001.79" dur="5.64">assets when the smart money&amp;#39;s doing it</text>
  <text start="4005.63" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s all part of the strategy that we</text>
  <text start="4007.43" dur="4.05">execute here I thought it one more</text>
  <text start="4009.62" dur="5.88">question if you don&amp;#39;t mind I don&amp;#39;t mind</text>
  <text start="4011.48" dur="6.39">okay so assuming that we for example</text>
  <text start="4015.5" dur="3.66">nationalize the Federal Reserve or we</text>
  <text start="4017.87" dur="2.79">get rid of the Federal Reserve if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4019.16" dur="2.91">possible and I think people should be</text>
  <text start="4020.66" dur="3.24">active politically toward that end</text>
  <text start="4022.07" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s kind of the other half of the</text>
  <text start="4023.9" dur="4.56">education thing is it to address this</text>
  <text start="4025.76" dur="6.03">whole monetary system smarter kids and</text>
  <text start="4028.46" dur="4.83">fairer systems but how will that affect</text>
  <text start="4031.79" dur="3.27">people how quickly would that affect</text>
  <text start="4033.29" dur="4.77">people what would happen to the average</text>
  <text start="4035.06" dur="5.85">everyday person when under the system</text>
  <text start="4038.06" dur="5.97">like that well what once that happens</text>
  <text start="4040.91" dur="5.31">quite honestly typically happens when</text>
  <text start="4044.03" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re going to finish monetizing the</text>
  <text start="4046.22" dur="7.56">debt and making that shift so when and</text>
  <text start="4050.48" dur="6.48">they started actually making some</text>
  <text start="4053.78" dur="5.25">transitions in 2000 and I think it was</text>
  <text start="4056.96" dur="4.71">ten was when I first started reading</text>
  <text start="4059.03" dur="4.14">about it so that&amp;#39;s actually pretty</text>
  <text start="4061.67" dur="4.26">normal as we&amp;#39;re going into</text>
  <text start="4063.17" dur="4.53">hyperinflation it&amp;#39;s whether or not we</text>
  <text start="4065.93" dur="4.5">need them on the other side of this mess</text>
  <text start="4067.7" dur="5.1">that&amp;#39;s going to be the case but yeah</text>
  <text start="4070.43" dur="3.87">once they&amp;#39;re nationalized they won&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="4072.8" dur="4.77">rid of them yet but once they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4074.3" dur="5.52">nationalized then it&amp;#39;s about printing</text>
  <text start="4077.57" dur="5.7">that money and hyper inflating the</text>
  <text start="4079.82" dur="4.65">economy okay and Lynette thank you so</text>
