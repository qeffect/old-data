  <text start="82.399" dur="3.54">coming out of the Woodworks I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="83.93" dur="4.68">citizen reporter for marketers have done</text>
  <text start="85.939" dur="5.581">over 5,000 interviews for marketing</text>
  <text start="88.61" dur="9.359">since 1993 but I haven&amp;#39;t been within the</text>
  <text start="91.52" dur="9.629">political milieu or the circles but I do</text>
  <text start="97.969" dur="5.371">listen daily on YouTube and I&amp;#39;m not a</text>
  <text start="101.149" dur="5.551">youtuber because most marketers are not</text>
  <text start="103.34" dur="4.65">but I&amp;#39;m a big fan of yours and the</text>
  <text start="106.7" dur="4.47">others who you&amp;#39;ve co-authored a book</text>
  <text start="107.99" dur="4.979">with as long with others who aren&amp;#39;t on</text>
  <text start="111.17" dur="4.739">the book and who haven&amp;#39;t byline the book</text>
  <text start="112.969" dur="4.29">and so today&amp;#39;s topic is about how to</text>
  <text start="115.909" dur="3.181">read pill someone will talk about what</text>
  <text start="117.259" dur="4.561">read pilling is why it&amp;#39;s important and</text>
  <text start="119.09" dur="4.62">how to have high intention and little</text>
  <text start="121.82" dur="4.32">attachment around the holidays there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="123.71" dur="4.5">lot of frustration given the current</text>
  <text start="126.14" dur="5.25">political climate where family members</text>
  <text start="128.21" dur="5.04">are separating from each other because</text>
  <text start="131.39" dur="3.66">of their own beliefs and confirmation</text>
  <text start="133.25" dur="3.84">biases so hopefully this will be useful</text>
  <text start="135.05" dur="3.84">in the next 30 minutes we share with</text>
  <text start="137.09" dur="3.78">each other yeah and</text>
  <text start="138.89" dur="3.66">you know people have reported to me on</text>
  <text start="140.87" dur="3.63">just my platform and I&amp;#39;ve heard it on</text>
  <text start="142.55" dur="3.93">other comments with other platforms as</text>
  <text start="144.5" dur="4.44">well you know they maybe they lost a</text>
  <text start="146.48" dur="4.35">wife or their kids won&amp;#39;t talk to them or</text>
  <text start="148.94" dur="3.57">you know their friends they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="150.83" dur="4.29">lost many of their friends or something</text>
  <text start="152.51" dur="4.11">over politics on both sides the country</text>
  <text start="155.12" dur="3.3">in the last few years you know whatever</text>
  <text start="156.62" dur="4.02">your belief system has become very</text>
  <text start="158.42" dur="4.05">divided so I&amp;#39;m hoping that this</text>
  <text start="160.64" dur="3.9">conversation can give people a chance to</text>
  <text start="162.47" dur="3.54">build some new bridges and create some</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="3.69">new bonds to kind of bring that back</text>
  <text start="166.01" dur="4.199">together because not you know at the end</text>
  <text start="168.23" dur="4.32">of the day there&amp;#39;s more that unites us</text>
  <text start="170.209" dur="4.351">than there is that separates us so you</text>
  <text start="172.55" dur="3.36">know where do we begin this is your you</text>
  <text start="174.56" dur="2.64">know you&amp;#39;re the master at this I would</text>
  <text start="175.91" dur="3.06">say that you are one of the most</text>
  <text start="177.2" dur="4.05">influential people in the world you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="178.97" dur="4.44">studied this a long time marketing is</text>
  <text start="181.25" dur="4.32">the art of influence the the science of</text>
  <text start="183.41" dur="4.109">influence in ethical or unethical ways</text>
  <text start="185.57" dur="4.08">and of course you&amp;#39;ve mastered the</text>
  <text start="187.519" dur="3.151">ethical side so how do we how do we read</text>
  <text start="189.65" dur="3.51">pill our friends and how do we</text>
  <text start="190.67" dur="5.28">breadcrumb them well I believe that</text>
  <text start="193.16" dur="4.2">great marketers are anonymous and a lot</text>
  <text start="195.95" dur="4.47">of people don&amp;#39;t know me I&amp;#39;m not very</text>
  <text start="197.36" dur="5.31">well known but I have nearly 800,000</text>
  <text start="200.42" dur="4.05">students since 1993 on six different</text>
  <text start="202.67" dur="3.539">continents every continent but</text>
  <text start="204.47" dur="4.29">Antarctica they don&amp;#39;t let us go there</text>
  <text start="206.209" dur="5.101">and penguins can&amp;#39;t type so one day maybe</text>
  <text start="208.76" dur="5.37">on a Quonset hut or something we&amp;#39;ll do a</text>
  <text start="211.31" dur="5.399">class there but I&amp;#39;m a BG digital</text>
  <text start="214.13" dur="5.52">marketer I started online as an internet</text>
  <text start="216.709" dur="6.211">marketer in 1995 these are the a AOL</text>
  <text start="219.65" dur="6.78">days and back then we got CDs and DVDs</text>
  <text start="222.92" dur="6.69">and each time we got one there were more</text>
  <text start="226.43" dur="7.11">and more hours and Steve Case was CEO</text>
  <text start="229.61" dur="5.58">back then and they made a huge run I</text>
  <text start="233.54" dur="3.12">used to get busy signal&amp;#39;s when I was</text>
  <text start="235.19" dur="3.51">living in Manhattan back in the day I</text>
  <text start="236.66" dur="4.169">live in California now and lived here</text>
  <text start="238.7" dur="5.7">most of my life and what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="240.829" dur="6.871">is in marketing with influence or</text>
  <text start="244.4" dur="6.92">persuasion the most sustainable the most</text>
  <text start="247.7" dur="7.14">effective the fastest easiest and most</text>
  <text start="251.32" dur="7.09">reliable way to win the heart of someone</text>
  <text start="254.84" dur="6.3">else is not to come across with feeling</text>
  <text start="258.41" dur="4.319">no whether you&amp;#39;re left or right either</text>
  <text start="261.14" dur="3.779">side of the aisle it doesn&amp;#39;t matter I</text>
  <text start="262.729" dur="4.321">remember when I used to debate in high</text>
  <text start="264.919" dur="3.93">school I used to take on the other side</text>
  <text start="267.05" dur="3.63">first like playing chess against</text>
  <text start="268.849" dur="3.301">yourself and it really gives you a</text>
  <text start="270.68" dur="2.13">perspective because you have a</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="2.07">confirmation</text>
  <text start="272.81" dur="2.67">bias which we&amp;#39;ll talk about in a moment</text>
  <text start="274.22" dur="4.44">and what that is and why it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="275.48" dur="5.7">important and it causes emotions to</text>
  <text start="278.66" dur="5.06">flare so the first thing is to be like</text>
  <text start="281.18" dur="5.22">parent and I&amp;#39;m a parent of two kids</text>
  <text start="283.72" dur="5.919">Gabriel and Brianna and they&amp;#39;re in their</text>
  <text start="286.4" dur="6.57">teenage years now and back in the day</text>
  <text start="289.639" dur="5.551">they used to need me to change their</text>
  <text start="292.97" dur="5.1">diapers and then they used to need me to</text>
  <text start="295.19" dur="5.31">make sure that they got to their soccer</text>
  <text start="298.07" dur="4.65">game or ballet practice and then now</text>
  <text start="300.5" dur="4.47">they just need money and then eventually</text>
  <text start="302.72" dur="3.66">you know hopefully they&amp;#39;ll appreciate</text>
  <text start="304.97" dur="3.81">you know how much their parents have</text>
  <text start="306.38" dur="4.59">learned over the years so bottom line is</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="4.8">if you&amp;#39;re if you have the patience of a</text>
  <text start="310.97" dur="4.8">parent and you have the love of a parent</text>
  <text start="313.58" dur="4.82">for the other human being and have some</text>
  <text start="315.77" dur="6.03">kind of appreciation for the other side</text>
  <text start="318.4" dur="7.96">it allows you to influence them faster</text>
  <text start="321.8" dur="5.01">better and a lot easier than if you</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="3.45">don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="326.81" dur="5.31">and it&amp;#39;s about high intention and low</text>
  <text start="329.81" dur="4.5">attachment if you get attached to your</text>
  <text start="332.12" dur="4.049">own feelings and confirmation biases and</text>
  <text start="334.31" dur="3.99">perspectives you&amp;#39;re not gonna be very</text>
  <text start="336.169" dur="4.62">successful so all this is about is just</text>
  <text start="338.3" dur="5.22">a few strategies from a marketing</text>
  <text start="340.789" dur="4.771">perspective how to politically plant</text>
  <text start="343.52" dur="4.44">seeds and you mentioned breadcrumb</text>
  <text start="345.56" dur="4.109">navigation it&amp;#39;s really about red billing</text>
  <text start="347.96" dur="7.05">we&amp;#39;ll talk about what it is and why it</text>
  <text start="349.669" dur="8.341">works but this is red pill secrets part</text>
  <text start="355.01" dur="6.93">1 of 3 and that right there is a red</text>
  <text start="358.01" dur="5.909">pill secret or strategy because if part</text>
  <text start="361.94" dur="4.89">1 isn&amp;#39;t useful to you I&amp;#39;m not gonna do</text>
  <text start="363.919" dur="5.641">part 2 and I&amp;#39;m not gonna do part 3 now</text>
  <text start="366.83" dur="4.77">if you respond and you comment you share</text>
  <text start="369.56" dur="4.59">you say hey I want to hear part 2 then</text>
  <text start="371.6" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;ll do part 2 and if you want to hear</text>
  <text start="374.15" dur="4.139">part 3 we&amp;#39;ll do part 3 and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="376.85" dur="4.2">way it works if you take the first</text>
  <text start="378.289" dur="4.561">breadcrumb then your your goal is to</text>
  <text start="381.05" dur="3">take the second one and the third and</text>
  <text start="382.85" dur="3.2">the fourth and there&amp;#39;s not a loaf of</text>
  <text start="384.05" dur="5.369">bread at the end of the breadcrumb trail</text>
  <text start="386.05" dur="5.14">because all of the breadcrumbs used up</text>
  <text start="389.419" dur="4.531">that loaf of bread so there&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="391.19" dur="5.28">light at the end of the tunnel there is</text>
  <text start="393.95" dur="4.29">no light what what there is at the end</text>
  <text start="396.47" dur="3.6">of the tunnel is a mirror now one of my</text>
  <text start="398.24" dur="3.54">mentors taught me that the light at the</text>
  <text start="400.07" dur="3.87">end of the tunnel is not a light it is a</text>
  <text start="401.78" dur="5.1">mirror so you can let that marinate and</text>
  <text start="403.94" dur="4.71">see what that means so we&amp;#39;ll start with</text>
  <text start="406.88" dur="4.89">if it&amp;#39;s okay with you if you know what</text>
  <text start="408.65" dur="5.22">does read pilling really mean that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="411.77" dur="3.69">a verb you know you hear it a lot but</text>
  <text start="413.87" dur="3.9">what is read pilling really mean is that</text>
  <text start="415.46" dur="3.66">fair to start with please yeah this is</text>
  <text start="417.77" dur="3.33">gonna be an important definition for</text>
  <text start="419.12" dur="3.87">people to start with and you know I</text>
  <text start="421.1" dur="3.54">talked about red pilling before what you</text>
  <text start="422.99" dur="4.02">normally see and I&amp;#39;ll give a quick</text>
  <text start="424.64" dur="4.29">primer is people shouting their opinion</text>
  <text start="427.01" dur="3.99">angrily at people on the internet so</text>
  <text start="428.93" dur="4.08">jealous you know the definition and then</text>
  <text start="431" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;ll go into bread crumbing - well some</text>
  <text start="433.01" dur="5.01">people don&amp;#39;t know what red pilling means</text>
  <text start="434.42" dur="6.6">so red pill clues from the movie matrix</text>
  <text start="438.02" dur="5.73">which I enjoyed it was a innovative</text>
  <text start="441.02" dur="7.17">movie and there&amp;#39;s a scene where there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.75" dur="7.77">Morpheus and neo and there&amp;#39;s a scene</text>
  <text start="448.19" dur="5.58">where there&amp;#39;s a red pill offered and a</text>
  <text start="451.52" dur="5.4">blue co and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s important it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="453.77" dur="6.03">not red pill or Noah pill it&amp;#39;s red pill</text>
  <text start="456.92" dur="5.7">or blue pill red pill is the truth</text>
  <text start="459.8" dur="6.27">the ruthless compassion of the truth the</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="6.3">stark reality of the truth or the</text>
  <text start="466.07" dur="6.33">blissful ignorance of the blue pill and</text>
  <text start="468.92" dur="6.33">just kind of being in the some people</text>
  <text start="472.4" dur="6.15">call it Normie land but I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="6.66">not very nice and it doesn&amp;#39;t lend itself</text>
  <text start="478.55" dur="5.85">to to red billing it may be more about</text>
  <text start="481.91" dur="6">you know being ignorant and and choosing</text>
  <text start="484.4" dur="5.13">not to look at harsh reality like</text>
  <text start="487.91" dur="2.64">becoming an adult we do things that we</text>
  <text start="489.53" dur="2.58">don&amp;#39;t really want to do that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="490.55" dur="4.92">difference between a child and adult in</text>
  <text start="492.11" dur="5.25">my opinion and so it is binary and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="495.47" dur="4.77">not political I mean it may seem ironic</text>
  <text start="497.36" dur="4.95">but red vs. blue you know you can fill</text>
  <text start="500.24" dur="6.57">in the blanks it&amp;#39;s not about that</text>
  <text start="502.31" dur="6.09">so bottom line is that when you take the</text>
  <text start="506.81" dur="4.74">red pill then you&amp;#39;re willing to go on a</text>
  <text start="508.4" dur="6.36">journey and the journey is to violate</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="5.28">your own confirmation biases and so</text>
  <text start="514.76" dur="3.36">these are action cars if you can see</text>
  <text start="516.83" dur="3.72">these the reason I do this because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="518.12" dur="4.979">more interesting than a talking head but</text>
  <text start="520.55" dur="4.74">what&amp;#39;s the biggest red pilling roadblock</text>
  <text start="523.099" dur="3.991">and red billing is a verb red billing is</text>
  <text start="525.29" dur="4.41">winning the favor of someone else but</text>
  <text start="527.09" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s not doing it instantly it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="529.7" dur="5.7">doing it as a parent it&amp;#39;s like allowing</text>
  <text start="532.97" dur="4.619">the other person to come their own to</text>
  <text start="535.4" dur="3.48">their own conclusion to have them seek</text>
  <text start="537.589" dur="2.591">the facts and if they&amp;#39;re not willing to</text>
  <text start="538.88" dur="3.01">seek the facts then</text>
  <text start="540.18" dur="3.24">no reason to continue because then</text>
  <text start="541.89" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;re gonna be rejected</text>
  <text start="543.42" dur="4.8">just like in sales so the biggest</text>
  <text start="545.64" dur="4.65">roadblock I believe is what&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="548.22" dur="5.16">confirmation bias</text>
  <text start="550.29" dur="6.65">now confirmation bias is searching for</text>
  <text start="553.38" dur="6.87">or interpreting or favoring and</text>
  <text start="556.94" dur="6.31">deductively affirming your prior beliefs</text>
  <text start="560.25" dur="6.39">or your values deductively we talked</text>
  <text start="563.25" dur="6.54">about that in a moment your hypothesis</text>
  <text start="566.64" dur="7.05">or your theories and this is the number</text>

  <text start="864.52" dur="5.43">which is near Newport Beach you know we</text>

  <text start="885.91" dur="5.43">relativity is known to be you know</text>
  <text start="888.67" dur="5.46">created and born and espoused through</text>
  <text start="891.34" dur="5.01">Albert Einstein now quantum physics and</text>
  <text start="894.13" dur="5.76">general relativity they&amp;#39;re both seem to</text>
  <text start="896.35" dur="4.11">be true but they&amp;#39;re there in conflict</text>
  <text start="899.89" dur="3.6">with each other</text>
  <text start="900.46" dur="6.87">so what does that mean well if both are</text>
  <text start="903.49" dur="6">absolute truths then they both can still</text>
  <text start="907.33" dur="5.19">exist and so looking at through both</text>
  <text start="909.49" dur="4.95">perspectives I think is absolutely key</text>
  <text start="912.52" dur="3.65">and and knowing about quantum physics</text>
  <text start="914.44" dur="4.08">and knowing about general relativity</text>
  <text start="916.17" dur="4.78">gets you to have a better perspective on</text>

  <text start="920.95" dur="5.34">does that make sense yeah absolutely and</text>
  <text start="923.35" dur="5.55">and fascinating I wanted to mention by</text>
  <text start="926.29" dur="4.35">the way earlier you said normies a lot</text>
  <text start="928.9" dur="3.42">of people use worse things than that</text>
  <text start="930.64" dur="3.51">like sheeple and things like that and I</text>
  <text start="932.32" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t agree with that I think that that</text>
  <text start="934.15" dur="4.23">kind of turns off the other side before</text>
  <text start="936.58" dur="2.98">you even have a chance to engage them in</text>
  <text start="938.38" dur="4.269">a polite conversation</text>
  <text start="939.56" dur="4.56">well they don&amp;#39;t have time to study what</text>
  <text start="942.649" dur="4.771">we&amp;#39;re studying I mean I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="944.12" dur="5.43">politically engaged at all but once I</text>
  <text start="947.42" dur="4.74">learned and I got read pilled by a</text>

  <text start="981.259" dur="6.57">inception now what&amp;#39;s an inception</text>
  <text start="984.74" dur="5.639">well inception means from I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="987.829" dur="6.93">from the latin term beginning beginning</text>
  <text start="990.379" dur="6.841">but it&amp;#39;s really the act of instilling an</text>
  <text start="994.759" dur="4.83">idea into someone&amp;#39;s mind it was a movie</text>
  <text start="997.22" dur="4.77">called inception Leo DiCaprio was in it</text>
  <text start="999.589" dur="6">I happen to like Leo DiCaprio as an</text>

  <text start="1005.589" dur="6.75">mission in the green movement and and</text>
  <text start="1008.68" dur="6.87">the reason is well when you go to Google</text>
  <text start="1012.339" dur="5.25">which is a trusted source by both right</text>
  <text start="1015.55" dur="4.709">and left well not so much right anymore</text>
  <text start="1017.589" dur="5.31">but the left for sure when you go there</text>
  <text start="1020.259" dur="5.28">if if all you did to red pill someone</text>
  <text start="1022.899" dur="5.76">and say does Leo DiCaprio really live</text>
  <text start="1025.539" dur="5.481">into the green movement that he purports</text>
  <text start="1028.659" dur="5.851">and he philosophizes you know because</text>
  <text start="1031.02" dur="5.289">hypocrisy is not acting what you talk</text>
  <text start="1034.51" dur="4.47">about right that&amp;#39;s out of integrity</text>
  <text start="1036.309" dur="4.89">integrity is from integration he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1038.98" dur="4.53">being integrated I happen to love him as</text>
  <text start="1041.199" dur="5.64">an actor that part of him but is he</text>
  <text start="1043.51" dur="5.94">really living into the carbon footprint</text>
  <text start="1046.839" dur="5.281">that he espouses well if you were to</text>
  <text start="1049.45" dur="4.02">look up his carbon foot on Google and</text>
  <text start="1052.12" dur="3.66">all you got to do is go to Google and</text>
  <text start="1053.47" dur="4.11">just ask it what is Leo DiCaprio as</text>
  <text start="1055.78" dur="5.49">carbon footprint all right so here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1057.58" dur="6.24">red pill strategy don&amp;#39;t tell them</text>
  <text start="1061.27" dur="4.47">whoever them is the opposing person</text>
  <text start="1063.82" dur="5.16">right so let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re debating about</text>
  <text start="1065.74" dur="5.79">Leo DiCaprio integrity which all that</text>
  <text start="1068.98" dur="3.78">means is he does what he said he does</text>
  <text start="1071.53" dur="3.96">right so he</text>
  <text start="1072.76" dur="7.95">saying alright let&amp;#39;s go green and you</text>
  <text start="1075.49" dur="8.09">know let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s have all of this let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1080.71" dur="5.28">not do these things that are creating</text>
  <text start="1083.58" dur="5.2">carbon footprints in our lives right</text>
  <text start="1085.99" dur="6.09">so what I do is I say well what&amp;#39;s Leo</text>
  <text start="1088.78" dur="5.52">DiCaprio carbon footprint Socratic ly</text>
  <text start="1092.08" dur="4.41">like Socrates you know going back 2400</text>

  <text start="1096.49" dur="4.92">don&amp;#39;t know I said well go look it up on</text>
  <text start="1097.93" dur="5.97">Google so if you go to Google and you</text>
  <text start="1101.41" dur="3.81">ask for Leo DiCaprio&amp;#39;s carbon footprint</text>
  <text start="1103.9" dur="5.16">then there&amp;#39;s an article that comes up</text>
  <text start="1105.22" dur="5.76">and at this moment it hasn&amp;#39;t been shadow</text>
  <text start="1109.06" dur="3.81">banned and not only there&amp;#39;s an article</text>
  <text start="1110.98" dur="4.29">come up it shows his carbon footprint</text>
  <text start="1112.87" dur="4.89">and then the average Americans carbon</text>
  <text start="1115.27" dur="4.77">footprint and here we go this is a fact</text>
  <text start="1117.76" dur="4.53">according to Google and Google is God</text>
  <text start="1120.04" dur="3.63">with a little G right Leo&amp;#39;s carbon</text>

  <text start="1329.83" dur="2.91">you think it&amp;#39;s completely objective</text>
  <text start="1330.97" dur="3.3">which I don&amp;#39;t believe in there&amp;#39;s no such</text>
  <text start="1332.74" dur="4.77">thing as objectivity right nowa facts</text>
  <text start="1334.27" dur="5.289">only interpretation right so they they</text>
  <text start="1337.51" dur="3.999">may answer whatever they answer</text>

  <text start="1372.35" dur="5.279">idea if they have a political agenda but</text>
  <text start="1374.499" dur="6.79">when you go to Google and look up who</text>
  <text start="1377.629" dur="7.05">the man of the year was that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="1381.289" dur="5.431">called it for Time magazine with all the</text>
  <text start="1384.679" dur="3.901">people they vetted with all the people</text>
  <text start="1386.72" dur="4.47">that were runners-up and all the people</text>
  <text start="1388.58" dur="5.36">that they had evaluated who was Man of</text>
  <text start="1391.19" dur="5.75">the Year during the Nazi movement in</text>
  <text start="1393.94" dur="5.679">1938 as world war ii is about to begin</text>
  <text start="1396.94" dur="6.609">and Nazis are taking power in Germany</text>
  <text start="1399.619" dur="6.42">yeah guess who it was yeah Hitler Adolf</text>
  <text start="1403.549" dur="4.59">Hitler right now what now I don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="1406.039" dur="4.11">them I tell them to go to Google and</text>
  <text start="1408.139" dur="4.02">just look it up because if you go to a</text>
  <text start="1410.149" dur="4.081">trusted source and you find out that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1412.159" dur="2.671">an inception you accept it and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1414.23" dur="3.12">the key</text>
  <text start="1414.83" dur="5.37">you can&amp;#39;t spoon feed them because spoon</text>
  <text start="1417.35" dur="4.919">feeding is codependence right you got to</text>
  <text start="1420.2" dur="4.89">allow them to independently find out</text>
  <text start="1422.269" dur="4.26">because that creates the engagement if</text>
  <text start="1425.09" dur="2.939">they&amp;#39;re not willing to do it they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1426.529" dur="2.84">gonna be read build not everyone can be</text>
  <text start="1428.029" dur="3.27">a read bill</text>
  <text start="1429.369" dur="4.15">that&amp;#39;s another rule you want to say</text>
  <text start="1431.299" dur="4.08">something go for it yeah I kind of want</text>
  <text start="1433.519" dur="3.181">to add to that I guess it takes away the</text>
  <text start="1435.379" dur="3.061">ego side of it where they would get</text>
  <text start="1436.7" dur="2.91">defensive or feel embarrassed and they</text>
  <text start="1438.44" dur="3.63">can kind of come to it on their own</text>
  <text start="1439.61" dur="3.899">without anyone else involved you know</text>
  <text start="1442.07" dur="3.809">looking at how they were wrong about</text>
  <text start="1443.509" dur="3.78">something or any of that thing that that</text>
  <text start="1445.879" dur="2.79">sometimes triggers the cognitive</text>
  <text start="1447.289" dur="3.541">dissonance where they get angry and</text>
  <text start="1448.669" dur="3.661">defensive and then they double down even</text>
  <text start="1450.83" dur="4.199">if you prove them wrong they&amp;#39;ll double</text>
  <text start="1452.33" dur="4.919">down and believe it all the more you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1455.029" dur="6.15">violating their confirmation bias the</text>
  <text start="1457.249" dur="6.241">only thing that can strike and just put</text>
  <text start="1461.179" dur="5.34">a crack in the dam one crack in a dam</text>
  <text start="1463.49" dur="5.46">let&amp;#39;s say Hoover Dam a little crack will</text>
  <text start="1466.519" dur="6.301">have that dam explode in Las Vegas is</text>
  <text start="1468.95" dur="5.939">toast after that right it&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="1472.82" dur="4.92">you know concrete wonders of the world</text>
  <text start="1474.889" dur="5.25">Hoover Dam so the reason I bring that up</text>
  <text start="1477.74" dur="4.409">is because you can&amp;#39;t attack someone</text>
  <text start="1480.139" dur="6.15">else&amp;#39;s confirmation bias because no one</text>
  <text start="1482.149" dur="5.551">wants to be told what to do this wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1486.289" dur="5.1">said when I was growing up but these</text>
  <text start="1487.7" dur="6.15">days and I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s maybe</text>
  <text start="1491.389" dur="4.591">cliche now but you&amp;#39;re not the boss of me</text>
  <text start="1493.85" dur="5.459">what does that mean you can&amp;#39;t tell me</text>
  <text start="1495.98" dur="7.23">what to do right so I just align with</text>
  <text start="1499.309" dur="7.2">that like Aikido or judo or you know</text>
  <text start="1503.21" dur="5.04">jujitsu I just take someone&amp;#39;s energy and</text>
  <text start="1506.509" dur="6.691">I just kind of flip it in a different</text>
  <text start="1508.25" dur="7.32">direction with verbal elegance and have</text>
  <text start="1513.2" dur="5.339">them do the work so that they discover</text>
  <text start="1515.57" dur="5.13">because experience is the only teacher</text>
  <text start="1518.539" dur="5.311">if they experience it then they may say</text>
  <text start="1520.7" dur="5.13">huh I wonder wow I can&amp;#39;t believe this</text>
  <text start="1523.85" dur="3.419">I&amp;#39;ve been given some breadcrumbs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1525.83" dur="3.059">not thinking that but they keep going</text>
  <text start="1527.269" dur="3.451">and going and going and anyone who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1528.889" dur="4.231">been read pilled anyone has gone from</text>
  <text start="1530.72" dur="4.53">right to left or left to right there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1533.12" dur="3.659">been a lot of left to right lately well</text>
  <text start="1535.25" dur="4.86">how does that happen</text>
  <text start="1536.779" dur="6.03">that happens through elegantly allowing</text>
  <text start="1540.11" dur="7.08">them to find their truth with the big T</text>
  <text start="1542.809" dur="8.1">on their own so let&amp;#39;s go back to Time</text>
  <text start="1547.19" dur="6.449">magazine again now as if 1938 was bad</text>
  <text start="1550.909" dur="5.61">enough right in the heart I mean Nazi</text>

  <text start="2457.119" dur="4.081">gone over 30 minutes but this is</text>
  <text start="2459.4" dur="3.24">fascinating stuff and I think people are</text>
  <text start="2461.2" dur="3.21">gonna get a lot of value out of it I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2462.64" dur="3.84">already learned some things I&amp;#39;d never</text>
  <text start="2464.41" dur="3.42">thought of before myself and you know</text>
  <text start="2466.48" dur="3.389">I&amp;#39;ve sort of heard a lot of this before</text>
  <text start="2467.83" dur="3.72">you know you&amp;#39;re one of my mentors and I</text>
  <text start="2469.869" dur="4.681">certainly agree with you that mentorship</text>
  <text start="2471.55" dur="4.55">is probably the key thing between you</text>
  <text start="2474.55" dur="4.77">know really becoming a successful</text>

  <text start="2479.32" dur="3.69">by the things that you can&amp;#39;t even see</text>
  <text start="2481.42" dur="3.03">that are holding you back because your</text>

  <text start="2484.45" dur="4.35">can&amp;#39;t I I&amp;#39;m full of flaws you know and</text>
  <text start="2486.88" dur="4.5">and sometimes I can&amp;#39;t tell that about</text>
  <text start="2488.8" dur="4.08">myself and and someone like you can can</text>
  <text start="2491.38" dur="3.9">give me a slap in the head and say hey</text>
  <text start="2492.88" dur="4.71">you&amp;#39;re messing up or hey could you</text>
  <text start="2495.28" dur="4.47">improve this or hey here&amp;#39;s a different</text>
  <text start="2497.59" dur="4.44">or better approach to things you know</text>
  <text start="2499.75" dur="4.98">and I was like everyone else early on I</text>
  <text start="2502.03" dur="4.2">started kind of just being angry at</text>
  <text start="2504.73" dur="4.08">people on Facebook and debating with</text>
  <text start="2506.23" dur="5.85">politics and I actually got really good</text>
  <text start="2508.81" dur="5.13">at first at making fun of them in the</text>
  <text start="2512.08" dur="3.15">appeal to ridicule method because I</text>
  <text start="2513.94" dur="3.06">could debate them on the facts but that</text>
  <text start="2515.23" dur="3">didn&amp;#39;t work so I would make them look</text>
  <text start="2517" dur="3.03">stupid in front of everyone else</text>
  <text start="2518.23" dur="3.48">watching and I would get the useful</text>
  <text start="2520.03" dur="3.6">idiot and then I would have the useful</text>
  <text start="2521.71" dur="3.78">debate but that you know that it works</text>
  <text start="2523.63" dur="4.05">but you know he doesn&amp;#39;t red pill your</text>
  <text start="2525.49" dur="4.56">target and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not compassionate</text>
  <text start="2527.68" dur="5.04">so learning as we go here and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2530.05" dur="5.58">improving over time and I invite other</text>
  <text start="2532.72" dur="5.43">people to do the same well I&amp;#39;ll end with</text>
  <text start="2535.63" dur="5.13">in this part one and we&amp;#39;ll do part</text>
  <text start="2538.15" dur="4.56">- if we get positive reviews and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2540.76" dur="4.44">more than willing to do part two there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2542.71" dur="5.22">no reason to continue unless there are</text>
  <text start="2545.2" dur="6.03">reviews and engagement because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2547.93" dur="5.79">basically mr. peeing into the wind you</text>
  <text start="2551.23" dur="6.03">know if that happened but there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2553.72" dur="5.79">famous German philosopher and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2557.26" dur="5.4">know his political goose back in the day</text>
  <text start="2559.51" dur="8.37">but he said that all truth goes through</text>
  <text start="2562.66" dur="8.669">three stages its first ridiculed and if</text>
  <text start="2567.88" dur="6.75">you think of a any political claim its</text>
  <text start="2571.329" dur="7.97">ridiculed at first like I&amp;#39;m being</text>
  <text start="2574.63" dur="7.52">wiretapped right the second phase is</text>
  <text start="2579.299" dur="5.56">it&amp;#39;s violently opposed</text>
  <text start="2582.15" dur="5.679">okay so first its ridiculed like oh come</text>
  <text start="2584.859" dur="4.71">on you&amp;#39;re crazy and then it&amp;#39;s violently</text>
  <text start="2587.829" dur="4.081">opposed because there&amp;#39;s a sense of the</text>
  <text start="2589.569" dur="4.891">truth right and so now there&amp;#39;s violent</text>
  <text start="2591.91" dur="5.909">opposition to it and then the third base</text>
  <text start="2594.46" dur="4.74">is it&amp;#39;s accepted as self-evident now</text>
  <text start="2597.819" dur="4.441">sometimes the truth like that could take</text>
  <text start="2599.2" dur="5.79">2,000 years hopefully those truths will</text>
  <text start="2602.26" dur="4.89">come out politically soon before the</text>
  <text start="2604.99" dur="2.7">next election who knows but whatever</text>
  <text start="2607.15" dur="3.27">they may be</text>
  <text start="2607.69" dur="5.129">it&amp;#39;s the violent opposition part that</text>
  <text start="2610.42" dur="5.189">most people lose faith where most people</text>
  <text start="2612.819" dur="4.591">lose patience and they just give up and</text>
  <text start="2615.609" dur="4.861">there&amp;#39;s a famous story in the book Think</text>
  <text start="2617.41" dur="6.57">and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill and there</text>

  <text start="2638.289" dur="2.82">know they went and bought some mining</text>
  <text start="2639.67" dur="2.879">equipment sand pits and shovels they</text>
  <text start="2641.109" dur="3.48">were digging digging digging and they</text>
  <text start="2642.549" dur="5.55">had their claim that they were staking</text>
  <text start="2644.589" dur="6.091">and you know they just couldn&amp;#39;t find any</text>
  <text start="2648.099" dur="4.531">gold so they they sold their mining</text>
  <text start="2650.68" dur="3.419">equipment back to the mining company I</text>
  <text start="2652.63" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t know how many cents on the dollar</text>
  <text start="2654.099" dur="5.041">then the mining equipment company said</text>
  <text start="2655.96" dur="6.18">these guys know nothing about mining and</text>
  <text start="2659.14" dur="5.939">they dug another three feet and they</text>
  <text start="2662.14" dur="5.61">happen to be three feet from gold - the</text>
  <text start="2665.079" dur="5.7">biggest mother lode ever discovered at</text>
  <text start="2667.75" dur="3.66">that time so when you&amp;#39;re three feet from</text>
  <text start="2670.779" dur="4.02">gold</text>
  <text start="2671.41" dur="5.609">then you never know that unless you keep</text>
  <text start="2674.799" dur="4.681">digging and violent opposition which is</text>
  <text start="2677.019" dur="5.161">phase were at right now I would just</text>
  <text start="2679.48" dur="5.25">implore people beseech them which is a</text>

  <text start="2699.73" dur="5.579">now um it won&amp;#39;t feel as good so just</text>
  <text start="2702.839" dur="6.22">sticking with it and unmet expectations</text>
  <text start="2705.309" dur="5.941">is not good for children adults or or</text>
