  <text start="118.939" dur="5.07">here we&amp;#39;re gonna dive into it you know</text>
  <text start="121.31" dur="6.33">this is kind of a I&amp;#39;m not gonna lie it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="124.009" dur="7.281">a smartass thing to do but it also is it</text>
  <text start="127.64" dur="6.689">makes a very pointed pointer or a very</text>
  <text start="131.29" dur="5.35">eloquent point now it&amp;#39;s not exactly up</text>
  <text start="134.329" dur="5.071">there with like a laconic phrase</text>
  <text start="136.64" dur="4.59">necessarily in terms of you know the</text>
  <text start="139.4" dur="3.48">power of your point for those who have</text>
  <text start="141.23" dur="3.75">heard me talk about the laconic phrase</text>
  <text start="142.88" dur="4.32">in the past you know a good example</text>
  <text start="144.98" dur="4.44">would be like the Spartans or the movie</text>
  <text start="147.2" dur="5.099">300 if you&amp;#39;ve heard of that or or brave</text>
  <text start="149.42" dur="4.62">Leonidas and his 300 brave Spartan</text>
  <text start="152.299" dur="4.05">soldiers going up against a million</text>
  <text start="154.04" dur="4.71">Persian soldiers</text>
  <text start="156.349" dur="4.441">under Xerxes you guys have probably</text>
  <text start="158.75" dur="4.409">heard about that but some things that</text>
  <text start="160.79" dur="4.41">you haven&amp;#39;t likely heard of are the</text>
  <text start="163.159" dur="4.11">Spartans laconic phrases which are</text>
  <text start="165.2" dur="4.44">really cool really famous actually</text>
  <text start="167.269" dur="4.651">throughout history and we&amp;#39;re very well</text>
  <text start="169.64" dur="4.83">respected among their own era as well so</text>
  <text start="171.92" dur="6.06">people think of the Spartans as soldiers</text>
  <text start="174.47" dur="6.09">as warriors as fighters they don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="177.98" dur="4.74">of the Spartans as philosophers which is</text>
  <text start="180.56" dur="4.89">actually pretty cool but my point is</text>
  <text start="182.72" dur="4.769">that a laconic phrase is something that</text>
  <text start="185.45" dur="5.22">when you hear it it just sounds badass</text>
  <text start="187.489" dur="5.161">it really does one example is in the</text>
  <text start="190.67" dur="3.3">movie 300 or back to the Leonidas</text>
  <text start="192.65" dur="2.699">situation and I don&amp;#39;t know if this</text>
  <text start="193.97" dur="4.109">really happened or not it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="195.349" dur="5.071">history books but when Xerxes said that</text>
  <text start="198.079" dur="3.81">they would blot out the Sun or at least</text>
  <text start="200.42" dur="3.42">one of his minions said that you know</text>
  <text start="201.889" dur="4.02">you can&amp;#39;t fight us will blot out the Sun</text>
  <text start="203.84" dur="4.019">with our arrows it&amp;#39;ll be dark because so</text>
  <text start="205.909" dur="3.75">many arrows are coming and then they</text>
  <text start="207.859" dur="3.901">responded the you know that the brave</text>
  <text start="209.659" dur="5.58">Spartan seems like that will fight in</text>
  <text start="211.76" dur="5.789">the shade another example is is when</text>
  <text start="215.239" dur="4.53">Xerxes father I always forget his name</text>
  <text start="217.549" dur="5.25">the king of Persia at the time a mighty</text>
  <text start="219.769" dur="4.83">ruler he actually had sent over a threat</text>
  <text start="222.799" dur="5.31">saying if you don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know her the</text>
  <text start="224.599" dur="5.28">exact words but if you don&amp;#39;t merge your</text>
  <text start="228.109" dur="3.24">country your country is in your nations</text>
  <text start="229.879" dur="2.121">and this is the different Greek states</text>
  <text start="231.349" dur="3.51">at the time</text>
  <text start="232" dur="4.9">city-states into our empire we will</text>
  <text start="234.859" dur="3.99">crush you and destroy you and wipe you</text>
  <text start="236.9" dur="5.25">from the history books like you never</text>
  <text start="238.849" dur="6.75">existed and the Spartan King sent back</text>
  <text start="242.15" dur="7.589">one word that&amp;#39;s it does the only word he</text>
  <text start="245.599" dur="4.591">sent back if and and that was all it</text>
  <text start="249.739" dur="2.131">took</text>
  <text start="250.19" dur="3.389">they never came to attack or at least</text>
  <text start="251.87" dur="3.989">not for a very long time so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.579" dur="5.761">exactly the kind of feeling that I got</text>
  <text start="255.859" dur="5.19">when I was reading over this tweet a</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="4.92">little I guess tweet back and forth</text>
  <text start="261.049" dur="5.281">between Brennan and Cruz so you know for</text>
  <text start="264.26" dur="4.409">the for the title here Ted Cruz says</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="5.91">whistleblowers should come forward on</text>
  <text start="268.669" dur="6.571">Obama and Brennan that made my George</text>
  <text start="272.24" dur="4.53">Rock that that made me think wow okay so</text>
  <text start="275.24" dur="4.23">of all the trends happening right now</text>
  <text start="276.77" dur="5.519">with all of the the build-up with all of</text>
  <text start="279.47" dur="4.83">the the Overton Window shifting with the</text>
  <text start="282.289" dur="3.99">word treason or traitor I mean even even</text>
  <text start="284.3" dur="3.44">Pelosi is now being accused of being a</text>
  <text start="286.279" dur="4.281">potential traitor by President</text>
  <text start="287.74" dur="4.89">than tweets this is a big big deal and</text>
  <text start="290.56" dur="4.53">this is the kind of rhetoric and talk</text>
  <text start="292.63" dur="4.23">where you know maybe they are activating</text>
  <text start="295.09" dur="3.57">the military reserves because maybe the</text>
  <text start="296.86" dur="3.57">left is actually planning a coup d&amp;#39;etat</text>
  <text start="298.66" dur="3.99">before they go down this is the final</text>
  <text start="300.43" dur="3.69">hurrah possibly before they actually get</text>
  <text start="302.65" dur="3.389">arrested for their treasonous crimes</text>
  <text start="304.12" dur="3.299">including Hillary and Obama you&amp;#39;re right</text>
  <text start="306.039" dur="5.22">because it all goes back to them as</text>
  <text start="307.419" dur="5.671">we&amp;#39;re seeing once again with Ukraine but</text>
  <text start="311.259" dur="3.72">what happened here and I&amp;#39;ve briefly</text>
  <text start="313.09" dur="4.889">talked about it but this deserves its</text>
  <text start="314.979" dur="5.551">own video Brennan said a reminder to</text>
  <text start="317.979" dur="4.801">federal officials there is no limit on</text>
  <text start="320.53" dur="4.56">the number of individuals who can use</text>
  <text start="322.78" dur="4.319">the whistleblower statute if you think</text>
  <text start="325.09" dur="3.87">you were involved in unlawful activity</text>
  <text start="327.099" dur="4.32">as a result of a directive from mr.</text>
  <text start="328.96" dur="6.06">Trump or someone doing his bidding</text>
  <text start="331.419" dur="7.141">now is the time to report it okay</text>
  <text start="335.02" dur="5.94">Brennan all right fine but Cruz responds</text>
  <text start="338.56" dur="4.05">a reminder to federal officials there is</text>
  <text start="340.96" dur="3.209">no limit on the number of individuals</text>
  <text start="342.61" dur="4.14">who can use the whistleblower statute</text>
  <text start="344.169" dur="5.131">kind of sounds familiar he says if you</text>
  <text start="346.75" dur="5.19">think you were involved in unlawful</text>
  <text start="349.3" dur="5.339">activity as a result of a directive from</text>
  <text start="351.94" dur="4.05">mr. Obama or mr. Brennan now it is that</text>
  <text start="354.639" dur="3.451">now is the time to report it</text>
  <text start="355.99" dur="3.959">so remember they&amp;#39;ve not only just made</text>
  <text start="358.09" dur="3.18">the rules a little bit more relaxed for</text>
  <text start="359.949" dur="3.21">whistleblowers so that they could try to</text>
  <text start="361.27" dur="3.899">you know impeach a president not gonna</text>
  <text start="363.159" dur="3.661">work but what they&amp;#39;ve also done is make</text>
  <text start="365.169" dur="3.84">it a lot easier for people to come out</text>
  <text start="366.82" dur="3.81">and bring truth out about them once</text>
  <text start="369.009" dur="3.63">again and I&amp;#39;m being a little premature</text>
  <text start="370.63" dur="4.56">here because we haven&amp;#39;t seen any you</text>
  <text start="372.639" dur="4.261">know honest or or conservative or or</text>
  <text start="375.19" dur="3.15">truthful doesn&amp;#39;t even matter if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="376.9" dur="2.989">truthful or if they&amp;#39;re conservative not</text>
  <text start="378.34" dur="4.049">just matters if they&amp;#39;re truthful</text>
  <text start="379.889" dur="4.83">whistleblowers yeah and I suspect we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="382.389" dur="5.071">about to see a huge number of</text>
  <text start="384.719" dur="4.241">conservative or truth or whatever you</text>
  <text start="387.46" dur="3.509">want to call them whistleblowers coming</text>
  <text start="388.96" dur="4.829">out of the government seeing Obama did</text>
  <text start="390.969" dur="5.1">this Hillary did this Brennan did this</text>
  <text start="393.789" dur="3.961">you know clapper did this call me did</text>

  <text start="406.659" dur="5.181">have all of these folks that are going</text>
  <text start="407.949" dur="6.301">down for this so this is a very exciting</text>
  <text start="411.84" dur="5.199">pattern you know I watched the patterns</text>
  <text start="414.25" dur="5.789">I watch for the trends this is an attack</text>
  <text start="417.039" dur="3.791">this is a okay you guys are going to ask</text>
  <text start="420.039" dur="2.861">for president</text>

  <text start="422.9" dur="3.21">stuff okay all of the whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="424.789" dur="3.541">that want to come out and tell us about</text>

  <text start="436.43" dur="6.329">phase this ends up with household names</text>
  <text start="439.25" dur="5.43">go into prison or Guantanamo Bay so this</text>
  <text start="442.759" dur="4.891">is the most exciting of many other</text>
  <text start="444.68" dur="4.769">points that I&amp;#39;ve seen lately because not</text>
  <text start="447.65" dur="3.81">only do you see President Trump in this</text>
  <text start="449.449" dur="3.75">back and almost like this death struggle</text>

  <text start="453.199" dur="5.491">leaders come out and take on that mantle</text>
  <text start="455.719" dur="5.76">of justice of going after the bad guys</text>
  <text start="458.69" dur="5.189">of actual punishing the bad guys of not</text>
  <text start="461.479" dur="4.291">having a two-tier justice system of not</text>
  <text start="463.879" dur="3.391">having a political elite class that</text>
  <text start="465.77" dur="5.48">escaped every bad thing that they do</text>
  <text start="467.27" dur="8.57">you&amp;#39;re starting to finally see the right</text>
  <text start="471.25" dur="7.18">Politico and go after the left this is</text>

  <text start="496.43" dur="4.739">four five souls that join up and start</text>
  <text start="499.34" dur="3.71">dancing along with that one crazy guy</text>
