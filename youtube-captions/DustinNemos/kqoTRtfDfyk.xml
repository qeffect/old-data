  <text start="31.92" dur="5.1">chats here so yeah this is good last</text>
  <text start="35.309" dur="3.27">time was a great discussion for those</text>
  <text start="37.02" dur="3.84">who want to come back and check it out</text>
  <text start="38.579" dur="4.171">we talked about the the roots of America</text>
  <text start="40.86" dur="4.16">and it&amp;#39;s kind of its Christian heritage</text>
  <text start="42.75" dur="5.46">and how it was actually kind of just</text>
  <text start="45.02" dur="5.65">almost a suppressed topic but today</text>
  <text start="48.21" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about you know midterms</text>
  <text start="50.67" dur="3.69">politics hopefully we can touch a little</text>
  <text start="52.71" dur="4.2">bit on that the the voter fraud issue</text>
  <text start="54.36" dur="4.499">and maybe even if you have a chance to</text>
  <text start="56.91" dur="4.379">discuss you know where you see the tax</text>
  <text start="58.859" dur="5.071">situation in the future</text>
  <text start="61.289" dur="4.26">obviously the midterms were very</text>
  <text start="63.93" dur="4.02">combative we just we just got through</text>
  <text start="65.549" dur="4.171">that it was a big mess followed right</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="3.33">after the Cavanaugh situation if you</text>
  <text start="69.72" dur="4.38">want to kind of chime in your opinion</text>
  <text start="71.28" dur="5.25">about that I wasn&amp;#39;t sure I was well you</text>
  <text start="74.1" dur="5.64">know the the long ensured the Cavanaugh</text>
  <text start="76.53" dur="5.28">deal is I really thought for for a</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="3.93">period of time that there was going to</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="3.33">be some backlash against the Democrats</text>
  <text start="83.67" dur="3.87">for the way they drafted dragged that</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="3.36">man through the mud for you know and</text>
  <text start="87.54" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s just of course it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="88.5" dur="4.32">reprehensible they did the same thing to</text>
  <text start="90.93" dur="4.799">a Republican candidate for governor in</text>
  <text start="92.82" dur="6.659">Minnesota in 1988 and and just you know</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="7.441">fabricated completely made-up claims</text>
  <text start="99.479" dur="5.521">about his having improper behavior with</text>
  <text start="103.17" dur="4.379">the young girl at the at the family</text>
  <text start="105" dur="5.34">swimming pool and it was just completely</text>
  <text start="107.549" dur="4.53">made up and ended up ruining the man&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="110.34" dur="3.48">life in his marriage he ended up I ended</text>
  <text start="112.079" dur="5.4">up leaving the United States went to</text>
  <text start="113.82" dur="5.64">Australia to work you know ended up with</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="3.361">a divorce now it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="3.509">Kavanagh is going to have that kind of a</text>
  <text start="120.84" dur="3.33">back last year and so that&amp;#39;s good but I</text>
  <text start="122.969" dur="3.571">honestly thought that there would be</text>
  <text start="124.17" dur="4.289">more of that coming down on the</text>
  <text start="126.54" dur="4.109">Democrats because of the irresponsible</text>
  <text start="128.459" dur="3.42">way they handle those hearings but you</text>
  <text start="130.649" dur="3.061">know Americans have a short memory</text>
  <text start="131.879" dur="4.381">Dustin as you know</text>
  <text start="133.71" dur="5.31">the Cavanaugh hearings were were you</text>
  <text start="136.26" dur="4.59">know late September into early October</text>
  <text start="139.02" dur="5.43">you know a full month away from the</text>
  <text start="140.85" dur="6.21">election you know when it when it all</text>
  <text start="144.45" dur="4.53">came down to it nobody talked about</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="4.74">Cavanaugh during the election at all so</text>
  <text start="148.98" dur="5.19">I think it had very little impact on the</text>
  <text start="151.8" dur="8.16">election and at any level of course it</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="7.11">would only have been a a Senate deal in</text>
  <text start="159.96" dur="2.97">any event because of course the hearings</text>
  <text start="161.28" dur="3.51">were in front of the Senate not the</text>
  <text start="162.93" dur="3.57">House of Representatives but but still</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="3.6">you would think there&amp;#39;d be some backlash</text>
  <text start="166.5" dur="4.23">there with with how you know with all</text>
  <text start="168.39" dur="4.41">these people think but the fact of the</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="4.8">matter is that the Democrats focused on</text>
  <text start="172.8" dur="4.5">health care that&amp;#39;s where they were with</text>
  <text start="175.53" dur="4.68">their discussion almost from beginning</text>
  <text start="177.3" dur="4.44">to end of the election cycle and and and</text>
  <text start="180.21" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s you know that&amp;#39;s just that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="181.74" dur="5.07">where it was that as far as as far as</text>
  <text start="184.26" dur="4.14">Democrat voters were concerned they they</text>
  <text start="186.81" dur="3.6">want government health care does the</text>
  <text start="188.4" dur="4.26">nets that&amp;#39;s what they want net lower</text>
  <text start="190.41" dur="6.09">free stuff is always an ever-present</text>
  <text start="192.66" dur="6.39">danger but and the free stuff thing you</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="4.62">know we&amp;#39;re seeing that already now you</text>
  <text start="199.05" dur="3.66">know moving into the into the next</text>
  <text start="201.12" dur="2.73">election cycle two years from now which</text>
  <text start="202.71" dur="3.51">of course will be a presidential</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="5.46">election I mean there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s Democrat</text>
  <text start="206.22" dur="4.94">leftists that are popping up here and</text>
  <text start="209.31" dur="4.8">there that are talking about the</text>
  <text start="211.16" dur="7.12">universal basic income promise now and</text>
  <text start="214.11" dur="7.94">and there&amp;#39;s a Democrat Senate Democrat</text>
  <text start="218.28" dur="3.77">representative that&amp;#39;s talking about a</text>
  <text start="222.23" dur="6.4">$500 a month universal basic income</text>
  <text start="226.65" dur="4.02">promise which which is you know</text>
  <text start="228.63" dur="3.57">eventually going to be as expensive as</text>
  <text start="230.67" dur="3.3">Social Security you would think are more</text>
  <text start="232.2" dur="3.86">more expensive than Social Security</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="4.68">because at least with Social Security</text>
  <text start="236.06" dur="4.99">you know you do have to meet certain</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="3.93">parameters to get Social Security you</text>
  <text start="241.05" dur="4.02">know you have to have worked for 40</text>
  <text start="242.58" dur="4.14">quarters you know you&amp;#39;ve got it you got</text>
  <text start="245.07" dur="4.32">to be certain age of course to apply for</text>
  <text start="246.72" dur="6">it and so there are some parameters but</text>
  <text start="249.39" dur="4.38">if we&amp;#39;ve got universal basic income you</text>
  <text start="252.72" dur="4.32">know free money from the government</text>
  <text start="253.77" dur="5.25">across the board every living soul in</text>
  <text start="257.04" dur="5.22">America you know what is what does that</text>
  <text start="259.02" dur="5.35">cost you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="3.969">virtually impossible to measure</text>
  <text start="264.37" dur="2.699">yeah helicopter money and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.229" dur="3.601">been tried before</text>
  <text start="267.069" dur="4.32">hasn&amp;#39;t that never really worked I mean</text>
  <text start="269.83" dur="5.79">there&amp;#39;s a lot of new things they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="275.62" dur="2.97">like that it&amp;#39;s just crazy stuff that</text>
  <text start="277.389" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re coming down the pipeline with</text>
  <text start="278.59" dur="5.46">yeah it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s all it&amp;#39;s all about</text>

  <text start="316.479" dur="4.261">isn&amp;#39;t one especially if you get power</text>
  <text start="318.43" dur="6.15">for doing so little bit most you get you</text>
  <text start="320.74" dur="6.449">get political power you know what what</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="4.53">people ignore or what what they lose</text>
  <text start="327.189" dur="6.121">sight of in all of this you know this</text>
  <text start="329.11" dur="5.519">free stuff discussion is you know where</text>
  <text start="333.31" dur="3.03">does the money come from when the tax</text>
  <text start="334.629" dur="4.65">rate has to go higher and higher and</text>
  <text start="336.34" dur="4.499">higher to support these things you know</text>
  <text start="339.279" dur="3.51">you got to break thumbs to get the money</text>
  <text start="340.839" dur="4.86">when you&amp;#39;ve got when you&amp;#39;ve got so many</text>
  <text start="342.789" dur="4.321">people on the dole and and fewer and</text>
  <text start="345.699" dur="3.75">fewer people that are paying the load</text>
  <text start="347.11" dur="4.049">and and more of the people that are</text>
  <text start="349.449" dur="4.53">paying the load have difficulty paying</text>
  <text start="351.159" dur="5.401">the load right be precisely because of</text>
  <text start="353.979" dur="4.86">the high rates then you gotta send you</text>
  <text start="356.56" dur="3.84">got to send more more folks out onto the</text>
  <text start="358.839" dur="3.63">street to break thumbs to get the money</text>
  <text start="360.4" dur="3.799">and then this this is the thing that</text>
  <text start="362.469" dur="4.471">I&amp;#39;ve said over and over over getting my</text>

  <text start="370.75" dur="4.889">fundamental tax reform and so on but you</text>
  <text start="374.379" dur="3.09">know I&amp;#39;ve said this over and over again</text>
  <text start="375.639" dur="4.231">it doesn&amp;#39;t make any difference what kind</text>
  <text start="377.469" dur="6.271">of a tax system you have whether it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="379.87" dur="6.539">flat tax or a graduated income tax like</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="5.099">we have now or a national retail sales</text>
  <text start="386.409" dur="4.29">tax or value-added tax or we fund</text>
  <text start="388.839" dur="4.471">government strictly by excises it</text>
  <text start="390.699" dur="4.361">doesn&amp;#39;t make any difference what kind of</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="4">tax system you have</text>
  <text start="395.06" dur="5.13">the system will become oppressive when</text>
  <text start="397.31" dur="4.44">the need for revenue is so great and and</text>
  <text start="400.19" dur="2.97">that&amp;#39;s you know that&amp;#39;s the point we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="401.75" dur="2.94">approaching here we&amp;#39;ve got tens of</text>
  <text start="403.16" dur="4.41">millions of people that have tax</text>
  <text start="404.69" dur="7.23">problems right now that owe money to be</text>
  <text start="407.57" dur="6.09">IRS that they can&amp;#39;t pay uh roughly 50%</text>
  <text start="411.92" dur="5.76">of the people who owe money to the IRS</text>
  <text start="413.66" dur="6.9">Oh more than $25,000 and so it&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="417.68" dur="5.4">problem for a large segment of our</text>
  <text start="420.56" dur="4.56">society that can&amp;#39;t pay the taxes they</text>
  <text start="423.08" dur="4.17">owe right now and so what happens when</text>
  <text start="425.12" dur="4.08">you start you know and every time you</text>
  <text start="427.25" dur="5.73">raise the burden it just gets more and</text>
  <text start="429.2" dur="5.55">more difficult it it gets complicated</text>
  <text start="432.98" dur="3.39">people then they when it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="434.75" dur="2.58">complicated they their brain shut off</text>
  <text start="436.37" dur="3.27">they don&amp;#39;t want to deal with they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="437.33" dur="4.92">think about it really it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="439.64" dur="4.95">simple people are promising free things</text>
  <text start="442.25" dur="4.86">to get political power they&amp;#39;re willing</text>
  <text start="444.59" dur="4.44">to still to do it other people are not</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="4.08">aware that this or they&amp;#39;re not thinking</text>
  <text start="449.03" dur="4.23">about this whole system is based on</text>
  <text start="451.19" dur="3.87">theft and force and at the end of the</text>
  <text start="453.26" dur="4.05">day you can kill the goose that lays the</text>
  <text start="455.06" dur="3.96">golden egg well and that&amp;#39;s exactly right</text>
  <text start="457.31" dur="3.24">you kill the goose that lays lays the</text>
  <text start="459.02" dur="4.14">golden egg and this is you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="4.98">precisely the concept that Frederic</text>
  <text start="463.16" dur="3.509">Bastiat put forth in his in his great</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="3.72">treatise the law</text>
  <text start="466.669" dur="4.891">he says democracies fail when people</text>
  <text start="469.25" dur="4.41">start to realize that they can vote</text>
  <text start="471.56" dur="4.68">themselves largesse out of the Treasury</text>
  <text start="473.66" dur="5.49">and largesse is just a word for for you</text>
  <text start="476.24" dur="5.67">know free benefits when people realize</text>
  <text start="479.15" dur="5.579">in masses to have America that you can</text>
  <text start="481.91" dur="4.8">vote yourself free stuff just by just by</text>
  <text start="484.729" dur="5.161">electing that the the person who</text>
  <text start="486.71" dur="5.01">promises to give you more free stuff you</text>
  <text start="489.89" dur="4.68">know there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a tipping point and</text>
  <text start="491.72" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s a point at which the producers</text>
  <text start="494.57" dur="5.46">can no longer produce enough to support</text>
  <text start="497.21" dur="5.13">the the consumers of government benefits</text>
  <text start="500.03" dur="3.57">and they don&amp;#39;t just suddenly stop asking</text>
  <text start="502.34" dur="3.45">for it if that the only there go on in</text>
  <text start="503.6" dur="3.99">fact they become accustomed to it they</text>
  <text start="505.79" dur="4.5">because they get to the point where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="507.59" dur="4.35">owed to them now it&amp;#39;s a now it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="510.29" dur="2.97">entitlement as a matter of fact that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="511.94" dur="3.42">exactly where we&amp;#39;re at with Social</text>
  <text start="513.26" dur="3.69">Security it&amp;#39;s an entitlement people have</text>
  <text start="515.36" dur="3.6">this mentality and I understand the</text>
  <text start="516.95" dur="3.57">mentality and it&amp;#39;s not even necessarily</text>
  <text start="518.96" dur="4.11">wrongheaded thinking when it comes to</text>
  <text start="520.52" dur="4.86">Social Security because hey I paid in</text>
  <text start="523.07" dur="4.33">all those years you know I had taxes</text>
  <text start="525.38" dur="5.08">taken out of my paycheck every sing</text>
  <text start="527.4" dur="6">at the time I was 69 or whatever my</text>
  <text start="530.46" dur="5.22">first job was at forward I paid those</text>
  <text start="533.4" dur="4.59">benefits I&amp;#39;m entitled to the I am</text>
  <text start="535.68" dur="4.59">entitled right to those benefits and</text>
  <text start="537.99" dur="3.87">doggone and I want my money back</text>
  <text start="540.27" dur="5.37">what people don&amp;#39;t understand is that</text>
  <text start="541.86" dur="6.36">that wasn&amp;#39;t a savings plan for us</text>
  <text start="545.64" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s no bank account in Washington</text>
  <text start="548.22" dur="3.69">with your name on it that&amp;#39;s got your</text>
  <text start="549.72" dur="4.71">Social Security money deposit in it</text>

  <text start="1269.93" dur="6.6">well that&amp;#39;s attributed to Edwin admin</text>
  <text start="1272.06" dur="6.75">Burke largely and Burke was Bert as I</text>
  <text start="1276.53" dur="3.66">said Burke was a champion of the</text>

  <text start="1280.19" dur="5.25">Parliament in in the midst of the this</text>

  <text start="1285.44" dur="3.9">so over and over again to make peace</text>
  <text start="1287.33" dur="4.35">with Americans and one of the arguments</text>
  <text start="1289.34" dur="5.91">that he made was that this this people</text>
  <text start="1291.68" dur="6.6">can this people cannot be governed by a</text>
  <text start="1295.25" dur="5.31">king because they&amp;#39;re educated and they</text>

  <text start="1306.32" dur="5.4">than once can&amp;#39;t be governed and so yeah</text>
  <text start="1309.53" dur="4.08">the might of the British Army might be</text>

  <text start="1313.61" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;ll bring them into subjection but</text>
  <text start="1315.8" dur="4.41">Burke argued you can&amp;#39;t keep them there</text>
  <text start="1317.93" dur="3.99">because that spirit of Liberty lives</text>
  <text start="1320.21" dur="3.21">inside of them and what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1321.92" dur="3.27">happen is you&amp;#39;re just gonna have to keep</text>
  <text start="1323.42" dur="3.87">doing it over and over and over again</text>
  <text start="1325.19" dur="2.81">and it will be the demise of the crown</text>
  <text start="1327.29" dur="2.36">not</text>
  <text start="1328" dur="5.37">the demise of the colonies and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1329.65" dur="6.48">remarkable his argument that he made in</text>
  <text start="1333.37" dur="4.2">comparison with with with the the</text>
  <text start="1336.13" dur="3.3">attitudes of the people that we have</text>
  <text start="1337.57" dur="3.93">today and we still have that spirit of</text>
  <text start="1339.43" dur="3.87">Liberty your evidence of that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1341.5" dur="3.57">people out there that evidence that in</text>
  <text start="1343.3" dur="3.99">this and this you know these types of</text>
  <text start="1345.07" dur="4.23">people come to the fore whenever our</text>
  <text start="1347.29" dur="4.62">system of government our way of life is</text>
  <text start="1349.3" dur="6.48">challenged but that&amp;#39;s why the left is so</text>
  <text start="1351.91" dur="6.66">determined so determined to eradicate</text>
  <text start="1355.78" dur="4.44">this stuff and and so completely</text>
  <text start="1358.57" dur="3.09">complacent when it comes to people</text>
  <text start="1360.22" dur="3.66">coming to America people have always</text>
  <text start="1361.66" dur="4.92">come to America c4x seek refuge</text>
  <text start="1363.88" dur="5.37">immigration is not new but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1366.58" dur="4.56">different is they is there is our</text>
  <text start="1369.25" dur="3.39">government now our left them foots put</text>
  <text start="1371.14" dur="4.77">this way the leftist in government are</text>
  <text start="1372.64" dur="4.92">are more willing now than ever to allow</text>
  <text start="1375.91" dur="4.38">these people to come in without any</text>
  <text start="1377.56" dur="4.74">level of assimilation whatsoever without</text>
  <text start="1380.29" dur="3.81">any level of understanding of who we are</text>
  <text start="1382.3" dur="3.81">what the system of government is all</text>
  <text start="1384.1" dur="4.17">about in other words they want to bring</text>
  <text start="1386.11" dur="4.38">their socialist that left us want these</text>
  <text start="1388.27" dur="4.74">immigrants to bring their socialism with</text>
  <text start="1390.49" dur="4.62">them that&amp;#39;s the difference yeah and</text>
  <text start="1393.01" dur="5.48">about 90 percent I don&amp;#39;t know the exact</text>
  <text start="1395.11" dur="3.38">number of out for the Democrats</text>
  <text start="1399.54" dur="6.97">so some midterms you know I just like</text>
  <text start="1404.53" dur="4.95">you I was surprised we didn&amp;#39;t see a</text>
  <text start="1406.51" dur="4.89">better situation after the Cavanaugh</text>
  <text start="1409.48" dur="4.86">thing I thought we would probably have a</text>
  <text start="1411.4" dur="4.95">red wave I was I was calling red wave</text>
  <text start="1414.34" dur="3.72">all the time and there&amp;#39;s definitely a</text>
  <text start="1416.35" dur="3.81">lot of voter fraud going on there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1418.06" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s you know they&amp;#39;re trying to just</text>
  <text start="1420.16" dur="6.18">in front of everyone just cheap multiple</text>
  <text start="1422.38" dur="6.78">states back but you know how do you see</text>
  <text start="1426.34" dur="4.68">the midterms what do you see well first</text>
  <text start="1429.16" dur="3.93">of all I mean just just you know we can</text>
  <text start="1431.02" dur="3.81">wrap a bowl on this Cavanaugh thing and</text>
  <text start="1433.09" dur="3.63">move on from there because we you know</text>
  <text start="1434.83" dur="4.59">we both recognize that that the</text>
  <text start="1436.72" dur="5.28">Cavanaugh backlash didn&amp;#39;t didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1439.42" dur="5.85">happen but here but here&amp;#39;s what here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1442" dur="4.92">what did happen about 50 percent of</text>
  <text start="1445.27" dur="3.57">every single one of the ads the</text>
  <text start="1446.92" dur="4.5">Democrats ran across the country this is</text>
  <text start="1448.84" dur="4.05">these I didn&amp;#39;t make these you know do</text>
  <text start="1451.42" dur="4.68">this analysis but something I read</text>
  <text start="1452.89" dur="6.26">showed 50% of all the ads that were run</text>
  <text start="1456.1" dur="5.47">by Democrats were run on health care and</text>
  <text start="1459.15" dur="5.75">the and the demo</text>
  <text start="1461.57" dur="5.22">I spent about 90 about 90 million</text>
  <text start="1464.9" dur="4.86">dollars just on health care advertising</text>
  <text start="1466.79" dur="4.17">along just that one issue Nancy Pelosi</text>
  <text start="1469.76" dur="3.24">said there are three reasons the</text>
  <text start="1470.96" dur="2.7">Democrats took back the house number one</text>
  <text start="1473" dur="2.13">health care</text>
  <text start="1473.66" dur="4.14">number two health care number three</text>
  <text start="1475.13" dur="4.38">health care all right so that is the key</text>
  <text start="1477.8" dur="4.2">right there Republicans didn&amp;#39;t talk that</text>
  <text start="1479.51" dur="3.81">much about it they&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="1482" dur="2.76">security issues they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="1483.32" dur="2.55">these very you know fiscal</text>
  <text start="1484.76" dur="3.12">responsibility all these various things</text>
  <text start="1485.87" dur="4.26">Republicans talked about but here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1487.88" dur="3.75">message and that is you know the old</text>
  <text start="1490.13" dur="4.74">saying in politics is that every</text>
  <text start="1491.63" dur="5.19">election is local but I&amp;#39;ll go a step</text>
  <text start="1494.87" dur="4.35">further and say that every election is</text>
  <text start="1496.82" dur="5.64">personal and so what happens is people</text>
  <text start="1499.22" dur="6.17">vote based on what their own personal</text>
  <text start="1502.46" dur="5.22">interest is and we have it we have</text>
  <text start="1505.39" dur="4.78">generations of Americans at least two</text>
  <text start="1507.68" dur="4.26">and maybe more generations of Americans</text>
  <text start="1510.17" dur="4.74">out there that believe the government</text>
  <text start="1511.94" dur="5.64">owes them something and so they vote</text>
  <text start="1514.91" dur="4.83">based on that what am I going to get</text>
  <text start="1517.58" dur="4.32">from the government this person over</text>
  <text start="1519.74" dur="4.17">here promised and promises me a benefit</text>
  <text start="1521.9" dur="4.26">this person over here promises me</text>
  <text start="1523.91" dur="3.93">nothing alright so if the election is</text>
  <text start="1526.16" dur="4.59">personal and it&amp;#39;s about what I&amp;#39;m getting</text>
  <text start="1527.84" dur="5.37">then the choice is very simple and so</text>
  <text start="1530.75" dur="7.86">that&amp;#39;s in my opinion that&amp;#39;s what has</text>
  <text start="1533.21" dur="7.59">driven is driving the the successes of</text>
  <text start="1538.61" dur="5.46">the Democrats to the extent that there</text>
  <text start="1540.8" dur="5.85">is and as a matter of fact the more left</text>
  <text start="1544.07" dur="4.92">they get the more they try to outdo</text>
  <text start="1546.65" dur="4.11">themselves with with benefits this</text>
  <text start="1548.99" dur="2.91">universal basic income is there&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="1550.76" dur="5.04">thing that we talk too much now that</text>
  <text start="1551.9" dur="5.43">said the Republicans held the Senate</text>
  <text start="1555.8" dur="3.66">they they actually picked up some ground</text>
  <text start="1557.33" dur="3.9">in the Senate so that was good so I</text>
  <text start="1559.46" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t know maybe I&amp;#39;m maybe this is just</text>
  <text start="1561.23" dur="3.93">my abject cynicism coming out but maybe</text>
  <text start="1563.42" dur="5.13">we got the best of both worlds right now</text>
  <text start="1565.16" dur="6.96">a Republican Senate a Democratic House</text>
  <text start="1568.55" dur="5.73">which spells gridlock so now now they</text>
  <text start="1572.12" dur="5.04">can&amp;#39;t do anything which which in my</text>
  <text start="1574.28" dur="5.64">opinion is a good thing no more laws no</text>
  <text start="1577.16" dur="4.35">more laws no more tax law changes you</text>
  <text start="1579.92" dur="3.3">know let&amp;#39;s just freeze some of those for</text>
  <text start="1581.51" dur="4.92">a while now and you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1583.22" dur="5.82">obviously a you know two sides to that</text>
  <text start="1586.43" dur="7.32">coin as well but the bottom line is if</text>
  <text start="1589.04" dur="5.94">we can have a session of Congress with</text>
  <text start="1593.75" dur="4.38">no new</text>
  <text start="1594.98" dur="7.439">laws to oppress people that&amp;#39;s not a bad</text>
  <text start="1598.13" dur="5.94">thing in my opinion yeah and yeah they</text>
  <text start="1602.419" dur="4.981">all they were running on is is health</text>
  <text start="1604.07" dur="5.31">care and resists you know to Trump</text>
  <text start="1607.4" dur="5.909">hatred the irrational Trump derangement</text>
  <text start="1609.38" dur="6">syndrome and you know their playbook has</text>
  <text start="1613.309" dur="5.041">always been the smear stuff but we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1615.38" dur="5.94">have to go over that again so it kind of</text>
  <text start="1618.35" dur="5.73">really does come down to opportunity ver</text>
  <text start="1621.32" dur="5.099">and safety versus free things and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1624.08" dur="4.65">a tough one to call especially in the</text>
  <text start="1626.419" dur="5.461">climate today well particularly when you</text>
  <text start="1628.73" dur="4.89">got so many so many kids out there</text>
  <text start="1631.88" dur="3.66">voting now and not just kids with young</text>
  <text start="1633.62" dur="3.39">people voting out there now that have</text>
  <text start="1635.54" dur="2.91">come through the public school system</text>
  <text start="1637.01" dur="3.18">and they&amp;#39;ve been they&amp;#39;ve just been</text>
  <text start="1638.45" dur="3.24">taught that government owns them you</text>
  <text start="1640.19" dur="3.63">know government is a responsibility to</text>
  <text start="1641.69" dur="3.96">do this for you got it responsibility to</text>
  <text start="1643.82" dur="3.96">do that and to do this today and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1645.65" dur="3.99">got this laundry list of things and</text>
  <text start="1647.78" dur="3.24">people people are taught and they</text>
  <text start="1649.64" dur="4.11">believe that they aren&amp;#39;t responsible for</text>
  <text start="1651.02" dur="5.31">themselves anymore you know we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1653.75" dur="5.1">this obligation to to draw out of the</text>
  <text start="1656.33" dur="4.08">system these benefits that we want you</text>
  <text start="1658.85" dur="3.03">know we got to we got to make that and</text>

  <text start="2209.24" dur="3.119">gridlock do you think we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="2210.65" dur="2.82">anything happen well I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2212.359" dur="2.311">gonna see anything coming out of</text>
  <text start="2213.47" dur="3.119">Congress in the next two years that</text>
  <text start="2214.67" dur="3.51">subsidy obviously what you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2216.589" dur="3.331">not to say that they&amp;#39;re gonna I mean I</text>
  <text start="2218.18" dur="3.899">was a little hyperbolic earlier when I</text>
  <text start="2219.92" dur="4.74">said no laws will be passed well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2222.079" dur="4.341">you know really wishful thinking on my</text>
  <text start="2224.66" dur="3.599">part that&amp;#39;s not gonna happen they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="2226.42" dur="3.58">legislation but there&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="2228.259" dur="3.391">any fundamental tax legislation</text>
  <text start="2230" dur="5.25">I don&amp;#39;t believe when the house wants to</text>
  <text start="2231.65" dur="7.199">repeal when the Democrats you know now</text>
  <text start="2235.25" dur="8.88">they&amp;#39;re now in now having control the</text>
  <text start="2238.849" dur="8.821">house want to repeal all of the of the</text>
  <text start="2244.13" dur="5.28">Trump the Trump tax laws tax cuts and</text>
  <text start="2247.67" dur="3.149">Jobs Act they want to repeal it</text>
  <text start="2249.41" dur="3.72">basically lock stock and barrel</text>
  <text start="2250.819" dur="3.69">Twala is you know Republican Senate&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2253.13" dur="3.87">not going to go along that so the</text>
  <text start="2254.509" dur="4.201">question is the question is is the</text>
  <text start="2257" dur="2.75">Republican Senate going to stand its</text>
  <text start="2258.71" dur="4.01">ground and we&amp;#39;re see</text>
  <text start="2259.75" dur="5.49">is to negotiate on those items to just</text>
  <text start="2262.72" dur="4.92">let the lost and the way it is until we</text>
  <text start="2265.24" dur="4.86">get the next election two years from now</text>
  <text start="2267.64" dur="7.08">or are they going to cave in like they</text>
  <text start="2270.1" dur="8.28">normally do and allow the the Democrats</text>
  <text start="2274.72" dur="5.13">to chip away at these at these you know</text>
  <text start="2278.38" dur="4.77">certain aspects of the beneficial</text>
  <text start="2279.85" dur="6.21">changes you know if if we if we use</text>
  <text start="2283.15" dur="5.04">history as our guide yeah it&amp;#39;s not good</text>
  <text start="2286.06" dur="4.41">you know then the Senate down or a</text>
  <text start="2288.19" dur="4.56">Senate or the the Senate Republicans are</text>
  <text start="2290.47" dur="3.48">gonna cave in and they&amp;#39;re gonna and</text>
  <text start="2292.75" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re gonna receive they&amp;#39;re gonna fall</text>
  <text start="2293.95" dur="4.92">back somehow that always seems to be the</text>
  <text start="2296.47" dur="5.04">habit for sure I&amp;#39;m a little bit more</text>
  <text start="2298.87" dur="4.65">optimistic based on some of the stuff</text>
  <text start="2301.51" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s happening lately and just how you</text>
  <text start="2303.52" dur="3.93">know the lines are really drawn there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2305.05" dur="4.29">there&amp;#39;s definitely you know the side of</text>
  <text start="2307.45" dur="3.66">the other side now and they some of them</text>
  <text start="2309.34" dur="5.61">at least I&amp;#39;ve been standing out more</text>
  <text start="2311.11" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;ll see how that goes is there</text>
  <text start="2314.95" dur="2.94">anything that you think we should we</text>
  <text start="2316.51" dur="2.85">should talk about and we&amp;#39;ve kind of</text>
  <text start="2317.89" dur="4.59">covered a few different things but you</text>
  <text start="2319.36" dur="4.47">know going ahead obviously house versus</text>
  <text start="2322.48" dur="3.72">in it&amp;#39;s going to be a big deal we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="2323.83" dur="4.65">some supreme court positioning that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2326.2" dur="4.89">good we&amp;#39;ll see how that well yeah and</text>
  <text start="2328.48" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s you know in my opinion the</text>
  <text start="2331.09" dur="3.6">probably most important thing that came</text>
  <text start="2332.53" dur="4.2">out of the election was not just that</text>
  <text start="2334.69" dur="4.22">the Republicans held the Senate but they</text>
  <text start="2336.73" dur="4.8">they picked up ground in the Senate and</text>
  <text start="2338.91" dur="4.87">and and you know that&amp;#39;s going to help if</text>
  <text start="2341.53" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s Supreme Court nominations in the</text>
  <text start="2343.78" dur="4.02">next two years which certainly there</text>
  <text start="2345.07" dur="4.5">could be no question about that</text>
  <text start="2347.8" dur="4.41">especially with Ginsburg in her</text>
  <text start="2349.57" dur="4.68">situation and so that that&amp;#39;s obviously a</text>
  <text start="2352.21" dur="4.5">positive thing no no not about that as</text>
  <text start="2354.25" dur="4.38">far as as far as you know where we go</text>
