  <text start="201.91" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s also known as real media so</text>
  <text start="205.39" dur="5.04">continuing on here see</text>
  <text start="208.06" dur="5.13">my computer&amp;#39;s a little laggy tonight for</text>
  <text start="210.43" dur="4.8">some reason I&amp;#39;m trying to ask for too</text>
  <text start="213.19" dur="5.88">much this laptop was gonna melt with the</text>
  <text start="215.23" dur="6.48">heat Texas family whose son was taken</text>
  <text start="219.07" dur="5.58">over medical dispute prevails after five</text>
  <text start="221.71" dur="6.66">months you guys may have heard about</text>
  <text start="224.65" dur="6.15">this story it was the Pardo family the</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="5.67">short version is that CPS once again</text>
  <text start="230.8" dur="6.39">abused their rights the baby took the</text>
  <text start="234.04" dur="5.449">child without any real reason and of</text>
  <text start="237.19" dur="6.09">course lost the battle in court and</text>
  <text start="239.489" dur="5.381">eventually just settled it out because</text>
  <text start="243.28" dur="3.66">they had nothing and of course we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="244.87" dur="4.44">seen again and again and again these</text>
  <text start="246.94" dur="4.83">incidents where Child Protective</text>
  <text start="249.31" dur="4.679">Services and the courts themselves that</text>
  <text start="251.77" dur="5.85">the family courts are usually in on it</text>
  <text start="253.989" dur="5.821">it&amp;#39;s just one big racketeering ring for</text>
  <text start="257.62" dur="4.23">for handouts from like a federal</text>
  <text start="259.81" dur="5.13">government for government money for for</text>
  <text start="261.85" dur="4.8">all at that now I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve had Mike Volpe</text>
  <text start="264.94" dur="3.09">on as well and I&amp;#39;ve did an interview</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="3.3">with him and he kind of plays the</text>
  <text start="268.03" dur="4.59">devil&amp;#39;s advocate there and sort of takes</text>
  <text start="269.95" dur="4.35">the side of well maybe the court needs</text>
  <text start="272.62" dur="3.99">to get him away from abusive family and</text>
  <text start="274.3" dur="6.63">stuff and look I understand there&amp;#39;s both</text>
  <text start="276.61" dur="7.41">sides of that and there is a at least a</text>
  <text start="280.93" dur="4.5">legitimate argument there I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="284.02" dur="5.34">if I would agree with it I still think</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="5.52">that frankly with the rate of abuse it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.36" dur="3.66">probably a letter to better to just</text>
  <text start="290.95" dur="4.05">leave kids with their families in almost</text>
  <text start="293.02" dur="4.68">all but the most extreme situations</text>
  <text start="295" dur="3.93">because you you take him into CPS and</text>
  <text start="297.7" dur="2.82">like a third of them get raped in the</text>
  <text start="298.93" dur="3.48">system and then who knows what happens</text>
  <text start="300.52" dur="3.75">to them when they you know run away at</text>
  <text start="302.41" dur="5.61">16 and become a statistic and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.27" dur="5.73">just exactly how it&amp;#39;s designed so at</text>
  <text start="308.02" dur="3.6">least this family one you know when</text>
  <text start="310" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;ve had some optimistic stories there</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="5.609">lately as well I&amp;#39;ve reported on so we</text>
  <text start="314.71" dur="5.19">also have one high school course on</text>
  <text start="317.229" dur="5.401">white privilege now being offered in New</text>
  <text start="319.9" dur="5.579">Jersey brainwashing children to hate is</text>
  <text start="322.63" dur="4.89">a pretty good article title it&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="325.479" dur="5.221">what they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="327.52" dur="5.67">trying to create racial tension and</text>
  <text start="330.7" dur="6.39">spread animosity between the races by</text>
  <text start="333.19" dur="6.3">spreading a very not to be you know no</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="3.69">pun intended but a very colored view of</text>
  <text start="339.49" dur="3.21">history</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="4.58">because they&amp;#39;re trying to skew the</text>
  <text start="342.7" dur="4.74">actual facts and data for example</text>
  <text start="345.36" dur="3.82">Christianity is the end of slavery</text>
  <text start="347.44" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the group that ended</text>
  <text start="349.18" dur="4.46">slavery William Wilberforce helped in</text>
  <text start="351.31" dur="5.4">slavery for most of the known world</text>
  <text start="353.64" dur="7.35">except ironically in certain parts of</text>
  <text start="356.71" dur="8.9">Africa controlled by Muslims so you know</text>
  <text start="360.99" dur="7.45">there&amp;#39;s a lot of blame landed for the</text>
  <text start="365.61" dur="4.81">colonialists or colonists and things</text>
  <text start="368.44" dur="5.07">like that and you know let&amp;#39;s face it</text>
  <text start="370.42" dur="4.62">white people and it&amp;#39;s just not it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="373.51" dur="4.35">fair to place that blame that way and</text>
  <text start="375.04" dur="5.91">I&amp;#39;ve broken this down in the past but to</text>
  <text start="377.86" dur="5.21">see them institutionalize and and put</text>
  <text start="380.95" dur="5.79">this kind of message and of course the</text>
  <text start="383.07" dur="5.53">you know that those giant Queen</text>
  <text start="386.74" dur="4.68">storytime stuff the transgender</text>
  <text start="388.6" dur="5.43">propaganda the see them try to weaponize</text>
  <text start="391.42" dur="4.2">our education system to to to</text>
  <text start="394.03" dur="3.45">indoctrinate children before they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="4.26">even developed their ability to resist</text>
  <text start="397.48" dur="4.32">this kind of stuff because children have</text>
  <text start="399.88" dur="6.51">a weak immune system right you know when</text>
  <text start="401.8" dur="6.69">a baby comes off of mother&amp;#39;s milk the</text>
  <text start="406.39" dur="4.08">baby no longer has the benefits of</text>
  <text start="408.49" dur="3.87">mothers immune system that&amp;#39;s how it</text>
  <text start="410.47" dur="6.12">works for the first couple of years of</text>
  <text start="412.36" dur="6.36">life at least in an ideal situation now</text>
  <text start="416.59" dur="4.68">the baby then starts to get sick more</text>
  <text start="418.72" dur="4.56">often and has a really weak and untested</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="4.02">immune system and just has to catch up</text>
  <text start="423.28" dur="5.22">right the baby has to learn and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.29" dur="7.17">exactly the same way our brains are</text>
  <text start="428.5" dur="5.64">wired to resist BS now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="4.47">doing is they&amp;#39;re hitting these children</text>
  <text start="434.14" dur="4.529">too early with every bit of disease of</text>
  <text start="436.93" dur="4.5">the mind they can come up with before</text>
  <text start="438.669" dur="5.521">they&amp;#39;ve built in a strong immune system</text>
  <text start="441.43" dur="7.04">and they&amp;#39;re crippling them for life no</text>
  <text start="444.19" dur="7.92">worse than a actual disease would do</text>
  <text start="448.47" dur="5.47">okay or I guess I should say a disease</text>
  <text start="452.11" dur="6.24">is no worse than this in terms of actual</text>
  <text start="453.94" dur="6.39">damage of course no surprise here one</text>
  <text start="458.35" dur="4.05">detective saying Bill Clinton was on</text>

  <text start="489.669" dur="5.121">is well this was really just another</text>
  <text start="492.22" dur="5.37">blatant example of just in-your-face</text>
  <text start="494.79" dur="3.939">hypocrisy and deception I mean this is</text>
  <text start="497.59" dur="4.049">the one of those examples where you</text>
  <text start="498.729" dur="4.5">really like really you think you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="501.639" dur="3.541">gonna get away with that that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="503.229" dur="3.931">blatant of a lie it is it&amp;#39;s like when</text>
  <text start="505.18" dur="4.58">they superimposed Hillary&amp;#39;s audience and</text>
  <text start="507.16" dur="5.869">they kept copy pasting and you had like</text>

  <text start="623.05" dur="5.58">are not ideal for a youtuber or studio</text>
  <text start="626.95" dur="4.65">kind of situation I even have a mirror</text>
  <text start="628.63" dur="5.19">closet Nura in this room tiny room and</text>
  <text start="631.6" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;s bad for the acoustics it bounces</text>
  <text start="633.82" dur="5.25">off the mirror and such anyway so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="637.09" dur="4.65">doing what we can this is not CNN we do</text>
  <text start="639.07" dur="4.8">not have a billion dollar budget I do</text>
  <text start="641.74" dur="4.62">the best with what I&amp;#39;ve got and we have</text>
  <text start="643.87" dur="4.74">a great team and I could not think of</text>
  <text start="646.36" dur="6.99">them enough I&amp;#39;m you know in fact John</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="7.35">David ping testing you guys are amazing</text>
  <text start="653.35" dur="5.82">and I could not do this without you so</text>
  <text start="655.96" dur="5.19">continuing on undeniable evidence that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="659.17" dur="4.26">a quote in regard to something being</text>
  <text start="661.15" dur="5.34">called the next Pentagon Papers moment</text>
  <text start="663.43" dur="5.25">okay so some 2,000 pages of notes of</text>
  <text start="666.49" dur="3.78">interviews with senior officials who</text>
  <text start="668.68" dur="3.59">have been involved in shaping US</text>
  <text start="670.27" dur="4.68">strategy in the Afghanistan war</text>
  <text start="672.27" dur="4.96">basically have now confirmed that quote</text>
  <text start="674.95" dur="4.11">senior US officials failed to tell the</text>
  <text start="677.23" dur="5.01">truth about the war in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="679.06" dur="5.13">throughout the 18-year campaign making</text>
  <text start="682.24" dur="2.37">rosy pronouncements they knew to be</text>
  <text start="684.19" dur="2.97">false</text>
  <text start="684.61" dur="6.33">hiding unmistakable evidence the war had</text>
  <text start="687.16" dur="5.46">become unwinnable end quote now this is</text>
  <text start="690.94" dur="3.03">bad enough but it&amp;#39;s not just another</text>
  <text start="692.62" dur="4.56">line this lycost</text>
  <text start="693.97" dur="6">I think over 2,000 dead lives and 20</text>
  <text start="697.18" dur="4.47">thousand injured US soldiers some of</text>
  <text start="699.97" dur="5.55">those folks you see walking around with</text>
  <text start="701.65" dur="7.05">metallic prosthetic arms and and legs</text>
  <text start="705.52" dur="7.14">and you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the price you</text>
  <text start="708.7" dur="8.76">pay for the the wars and the lies the</text>
  <text start="712.66" dur="8.88">government sends you into so moving on</text>
  <text start="717.46" dur="5.7">yeah I mean that&amp;#39;s no surprise there</text>
  <text start="721.54" dur="4.25">either every war that we get into</text>
  <text start="723.16" dur="5.43">basically is a false event I mean</text>
  <text start="725.79" dur="5.14">everything from the Gulf of Tonkin to</text>
  <text start="728.59" dur="4.59">Pearl Harbor which there was other</text>
  <text start="730.93" dur="4.35">context to that that actually I mean</text>
  <text start="733.18" dur="3.22">that the attack was real but the context</text>
  <text start="735.28" dur="3.46">was very much differ</text>
  <text start="736.4" dur="5.25">and just about every single war that you</text>
  <text start="738.74" dur="5.34">could imagine almost always people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="741.65" dur="4.14">want it but just like the Nazis I think</text>
  <text start="744.08" dur="4.59">it was Goebbels or whatever his name is</text>
  <text start="745.79" dur="4.83">just like they said people don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="748.67" dur="4.71">war but of course you can goad them into</text>
  <text start="750.62" dur="4.29">it by setting on one of your own</text>
  <text start="753.38" dur="3.15">buildings on fire or something like</text>
  <text start="754.91" dur="3.42">Hitler date he set the Reichstag the</text>
  <text start="756.53" dur="4.05">German parliament building on fire and</text>
  <text start="758.33" dur="3.72">then declared it was an enemy and then</text>
  <text start="760.58" dur="3.3">said anyone who&amp;#39;s not on our team to</text>
  <text start="762.05" dur="4.14">fight the enemy it&amp;#39;s just not a patriot</text>
  <text start="763.88" dur="3.99">and doesn&amp;#39;t care about his country so</text>
  <text start="766.19" dur="4.64">it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a shame them into silence</text>
  <text start="767.87" dur="7.38">campaign very powerful in certain</text>
  <text start="770.83" dur="6.28">political climates so we also have an IG</text>
  <text start="775.25" dur="4.83">faisal report revealing that obama</text>
  <text start="777.11" dur="5.7">administration or vig FISA report</text>
  <text start="780.08" dur="7.22">revealing Obama administration falsely</text>
  <text start="782.81" dur="6.87">claimed Russia bribed Trump campaign so</text>
  <text start="787.3" dur="4.69">they&amp;#39;ve been caught lying they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="789.68" dur="4.01">caught being involved even at the</text>
  <text start="791.99" dur="3.93">highest level that means Obama himself</text>
  <text start="793.69" dur="4.12">and we know that from a number of</text>
  <text start="795.92" dur="5.52">different ways now including the text</text>
  <text start="797.81" dur="5.64">from the the lovers and this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="801.44" dur="4.38">look good I mean of course we&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="803.45" dur="4.5">known that these guys are guilty now the</text>
  <text start="805.82" dur="4.5">evidence is coming out it&amp;#39;s slowly</text>
  <text start="807.95" dur="4.43">trickling out and you&amp;#39;re seeing these</text>
  <text start="810.32" dur="5.22">guys really panic you&amp;#39;re seeing Obama</text>
  <text start="812.38" dur="6.04">panic you&amp;#39;re seeing Biden losses and</text>
  <text start="815.54" dur="5.37">marbles you&amp;#39;re seeing Pelosi breakdown</text>
  <text start="818.42" dur="5.04">and I&amp;#39;ll remind everyone that Pelosi is</text>
  <text start="820.91" dur="4.53">in that position because Trump let her</text>
  <text start="823.46" dur="3.9">be there remember he even promised to</text>
  <text start="825.44" dur="5.31">bring Republican votes to keep her in</text>
  <text start="827.36" dur="5.43">that position so he&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="830.75" dur="4.32">where he wants her and maybe this</text>
  <text start="832.79" dur="5.22">impeachment thing is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="835.07" dur="4.55">maybe she&amp;#39;s in his pocket as well and</text>
  <text start="838.01" dur="4.71">and she has to do what he says because</text>
  <text start="839.62" dur="6.94">she knows he&amp;#39;s got dirt on her too who</text>
  <text start="842.72" dur="6.51">knows right so the Q movement has</text>
  <text start="846.56" dur="5.25">unearthed so much that it it would not</text>
  <text start="849.23" dur="5.01">surprise me if she was part of the plan</text>
  <text start="851.81" dur="4.5">as well and not because she&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="854.24" dur="5.43">person but because they had taken her</text>
  <text start="856.31" dur="5.52">over or she had been turned or flipped</text>
  <text start="859.67" dur="5.55">because that&amp;#39;s happening right now a lot</text>
  <text start="861.83" dur="4.99">too so you know that&amp;#39;s another one we</text>
  <text start="865.22" dur="5.32">also have</text>
  <text start="866.82" dur="7.019">Alijah computer inspector-general rocked</text>
  <text start="870.54" dur="6.33">IG told to falsify documents fabricate</text>
  <text start="873.839" dur="5.521">evidence and alter witness testimony in</text>
  <text start="876.87" dur="6.54">a rigged investigation though this is</text>
  <text start="879.36" dur="6.06">not the exact same IG report but this is</text>
  <text start="883.41" dur="4.88">a window into the office of the</text>
  <text start="885.42" dur="6.359">inspector general and that tells you a</text>
  <text start="888.29" dur="6.97">sordid tale of basically fixing the game</text>
  <text start="891.779" dur="5.521">so of course this inspector general the</text>
  <text start="895.26" dur="3.9">guy who is supposed to inspect things</text>
  <text start="897.3" dur="5.13">the office that is supposed to inspect</text>
  <text start="899.16" dur="6.78">for corruption and such and and look</text>
  <text start="902.43" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s kind of like the what are the the</text>
  <text start="905.94" dur="4.139">local police station they have the</text>
  <text start="907.62" dur="4.5">normal cops and then they have like the</text>
  <text start="910.079" dur="3.331">the cops that investigate the other cops</text>
  <text start="912.12" dur="3.87">right I don&amp;#39;t remember what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="913.41" dur="4.109">supposed to be called but you have those</text>
  <text start="915.99" dur="3.45">guys and that&amp;#39;s what this boat is</text>
  <text start="917.519" dur="4.141">supposed to be but instead you find that</text>
  <text start="919.44" dur="4.019">they&amp;#39;re fixing the game to the official</text>
  <text start="921.66" dur="4.44">narrative and they&amp;#39;re just there to be</text>
  <text start="923.459" dur="4.68">fixers so how much of that played into</text>
  <text start="926.1" dur="4.62">the IG report with Horowitz how much of</text>
  <text start="928.139" dur="3.991">that report was whitewashed how much of</text>
  <text start="930.72" dur="3.96">it was toned down</text>
  <text start="932.13" dur="5.16">we have bar and we have Trump seeing</text>
  <text start="934.68" dur="4.74">well it&amp;#39;s a little bit more than that</text>
  <text start="937.29" dur="4.5">and it&amp;#39;s kind of obvious so you know</text>
  <text start="939.42" dur="4.289">everyone&amp;#39;s already contesting it and in</text>
  <text start="941.79" dur="3.69">normal times I don&amp;#39;t even think that you</text>
  <text start="943.709" dur="4.141">would see an Ag can test that and so</text>
  <text start="945.48" dur="4.95">openly so obviously he&amp;#39;s got it</text>
  <text start="947.85" dur="3.989">pretty off and I don&amp;#39;t know if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="950.43" dur="6.63">still supposed to trust ray or not</text>
  <text start="951.839" dur="8.131">either yeah okay so continuing on from</text>
  <text start="957.06" dur="5.73">there we have Pelosi and the Democrats</text>
  <text start="959.97" dur="5.4">losing pretty badly they are now losing</text>
  <text start="962.79" dur="4.08">in all of the swing states with the</text>
  <text start="965.37" dur="2.329">Democrats who are trying to support</text>
  <text start="966.87" dur="3.449">impeachment</text>
  <text start="967.699" dur="4.811">it&amp;#39;s getting it&amp;#39;s getting good going</text>
  <text start="970.319" dur="4.411">into 2020 they&amp;#39;ve pushed all the way and</text>
  <text start="972.51" dur="4.74">now the pendulum is swinging back askew</text>
  <text start="974.73" dur="4.65">and on has predicted a year of the</text>
