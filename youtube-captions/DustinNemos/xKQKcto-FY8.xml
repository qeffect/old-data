  <text start="3.3" dur="5.12">demos of destiny Mouse calm now this is</text>
  <text start="6.12" dur="4.8">going to be a very brief update about</text>
  <text start="8.42" dur="6.129">animal health and something called the</text>
  <text start="10.92" dur="5.16">barf diet no not puke you you&amp;#39;ll hear my</text>
  <text start="14.549" dur="4.201">baby in the background she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s with</text>
  <text start="16.08" dur="6.359">me today I&amp;#39;m babysitting right now mom</text>
  <text start="18.75" dur="6.81">is somewhere but it&amp;#39;s called the bone</text>
  <text start="22.439" dur="5.551">and raw food diet now I&amp;#39;ve got a lot of</text>
  <text start="25.56" dur="4.86">vegetarians and even a few vegans in my</text>
  <text start="27.99" dur="3.99">audience and it&amp;#39;s about time again to</text>
  <text start="30.42" dur="3.299">explain this so I don&amp;#39;t have to address</text>
  <text start="31.98" dur="4.59">in the comments you know repeatedly</text>
  <text start="33.719" dur="5.34">repeatedly and you guys deserve a good</text>
  <text start="36.57" dur="3.989">response and I don&amp;#39;t want you to think</text>
  <text start="39.059" dur="5.131">I&amp;#39;m some sort of animal killing monster</text>
  <text start="40.559" dur="5.25">so here it is one it&amp;#39;s a health decision</text>
  <text start="44.19" dur="3.15">because the stuff that we get in the</text>
  <text start="45.809" dur="2.971">stores you know the meat products we get</text>
  <text start="47.34" dur="3.239">in the stores are really unhealthy</text>
  <text start="48.78" dur="4.74">because the way they&amp;#39;re raised - it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="50.579" dur="6.511">moral decision because you know back to</text>
  <text start="53.52" dur="4.74">one real fast the the research that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="57.09" dur="3.42">done suggests that there is a</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="6.84">requirement for animal intake okay</text>
  <text start="60.51" dur="6.45">especially things like DHA but you know</text>
  <text start="65.1" dur="3.57">Mercola calm can go into that a little</text>
  <text start="66.96" dur="3.18">bit better than I can but you know</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="3.809">that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m going on I don&amp;#39;t need a</text>
  <text start="70.14" dur="4.229">ton of meat because you know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="72.479" dur="3.541">heavy food and it wears you out and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="74.369" dur="3.301">like really hard to digest and it can</text>
  <text start="76.02" dur="3.239">last like a month in your gut if you</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="3.48">don&amp;#39;t have really good healthy got and</text>
  <text start="79.259" dur="4.261">everything so I don&amp;#39;t suggest like a ton</text>
  <text start="81.15" dur="5.37">of meat or anything however it is</text>
  <text start="83.52" dur="4.169">required to be healthy - it&amp;#39;s a moral</text>
  <text start="86.52" dur="3.57">decision because the way these animals</text>
  <text start="87.689" dur="3.841">are raised in these these terrible</text>
  <text start="90.09" dur="2.97">environments you know in they&amp;#39;re only a</text>
  <text start="91.53" dur="4.56">few V if you&amp;#39;ve ever seen any of these</text>
  <text start="93.06" dur="4.44">things I mean you know maybe if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="3.06">kids in the room pause this real fast</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="3.299">let me explain some of these things okay</text>
  <text start="99.15" dur="2.789">I&amp;#39;ve watched some of these films where</text>
  <text start="100.799" dur="2.61">these people will go in and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="3.061">infiltrate these slaughterhouses or</text>
  <text start="103.409" dur="3.631">these meat farms and they&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="105" dur="3.689">piglets by the back leg and slam them in</text>
  <text start="107.04" dur="3.18">their head into the concrete and if they</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="2.911">if they&amp;#39;re not dead at that point or</text>
  <text start="110.22" dur="2.46">unconscious well they&amp;#39;ll throw them in</text>
  <text start="111.6" dur="3.99">the back and then they&amp;#39;ll just go</text>
  <text start="112.68" dur="4.979">through the meat processing live okay</text>
  <text start="115.59" dur="4.559">the chickens are raised in their own</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="5.431">feces I mean that the this is a terrible</text>
  <text start="120.149" dur="6.15">way to to be disconnected from and not</text>
  <text start="123.09" dur="5.07">get health and and to torture your food</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="3.151">before it gets to you and you know</text>
  <text start="128.16" dur="2.879">whether or not you believe in that whole</text>
  <text start="129.45" dur="3.45">energetic connection between all things</text>
  <text start="131.039" dur="4.141">I kinda am starting to believe in that</text>
  <text start="132.9" dur="3.899">I&amp;#39;ve seen too much at this point</text>
  <text start="135.18" dur="5.52">and I feel like there is it there is a</text>
  <text start="136.799" dur="7.201">health aspect between happy meet and and</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="4.739">and your health when you eat it in a</text>
  <text start="144" dur="3.36">myriad of ways you know obviously a</text>
  <text start="145.439" dur="3.841">positive attitude and good and good</text>
  <text start="147.36" dur="3.42">vibes can actually improve your health I</text>
  <text start="149.28" dur="2.97">mean we&amp;#39;ve had the placebo effect and</text>
  <text start="150.78" dur="3.329">that&amp;#39;s been proven for a long time you</text>
  <text start="152.25" dur="3.78">can actually heal with your thoughts by</text>
  <text start="154.109" dur="5.761">thinking that you&amp;#39;re getting medicine</text>
  <text start="156.03" dur="5.819">when it&amp;#39;s just sugar pills okay but you</text>
  <text start="159.87" dur="2.31">know it so it&amp;#39;s a health decision for my</text>
  <text start="161.849" dur="1.98">health</text>
  <text start="162.18" dur="3.059">it&amp;#39;s a moral decision for the animals</text>
  <text start="163.829" dur="3.121">that are suffering out there the animals</text>
  <text start="165.239" dur="2.911">that I raise are incredibly they only</text>
  <text start="166.95" dur="3.899">have rabbits right now but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.15" dur="4.559">incredibly happy okay someone mentioned</text>
  <text start="170.849" dur="3.091">the other day that blue was not happy</text>
  <text start="172.709" dur="3.45">with about me picking him up best a</text>
  <text start="173.94" dur="4.29">little darker bunny his name is blue</text>
  <text start="176.159" dur="4.11">he&amp;#39;s not happy about me picking him up</text>
  <text start="178.23" dur="4.92">because I have to do his ears and he has</text>
  <text start="180.269" dur="28.64">ear mites and I have to squirt some some</text>
  <text start="183.15" dur="29.299">solution in his ears made out of okay so</text>
  <text start="208.909" dur="6.67">you know where was I</text>
  <text start="212.449" dur="4.991">he that my animals very happy and you</text>
  <text start="215.579" dur="3.33">know in rabbits or prey animals they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="217.44" dur="3.949">they&amp;#39;ll be very shy of you anyway but</text>
  <text start="218.909" dur="5.01">you know most of my rabbits actually I</text>
  <text start="221.389" dur="4.901">got a few that will just come up and put</text>
  <text start="223.919" dur="4.29">their head under my under my hands when</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="3.689">I when I put my hand in there and you</text>
  <text start="228.209" dur="3.9">know I go out there during the summer</text>
  <text start="229.979" dur="3.361">and I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll give them grass if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.109" dur="3.78">in a cage or something and I&amp;#39;ll give</text>
  <text start="233.34" dur="6.479">them grass that I pick you know by hand</text>
  <text start="235.889" dur="5.97">so so these guys are getting these guys</text>
  <text start="239.819" dur="6.54">are getting a really good life aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="241.859" dur="5.52">they booger you see that&amp;#39;s you so</text>
  <text start="246.359" dur="2.821">they&amp;#39;re not only getting a really good</text>
  <text start="247.379" dur="3.39">life but really for vegans and</text>
  <text start="249.18" dur="2.699">vegetarians who just don&amp;#39;t believe any</text>
  <text start="250.769" dur="3.15">of that and they&amp;#39;re like look you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="251.879" dur="3.33">you don&amp;#39;t have to eat meat to survive</text>
  <text start="253.919" dur="1.97">you could do it without the meat okay</text>
  <text start="255.209" dur="2.851">fine</text>
  <text start="255.889" dur="6.16">here&amp;#39;s a couple of other arguments for</text>
  <text start="258.06" dur="5.82">you one cats and dogs even dogs are</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="2.851">something called an obligate kin of or</text>
  <text start="263.88" dur="2.22">our carnivore</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="3.27">so he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="266.1" dur="5.22">so maybe maybe if they&amp;#39;re eating Canford</text>
  <text start="268.17" dur="6.21">can&amp;#39;t afford so you know they actually</text>
  <text start="271.32" dur="4.71">need meat and this is raw meat in their</text>
  <text start="274.38" dur="4.35">back they have the kind of bacterial</text>
  <text start="276.03" dur="4.68">resistance that can handle raw meat you</text>
  <text start="278.73" dur="5.58">know healthy raw meat it was race right</text>
  <text start="280.71" dur="5.67">not not some sick stuff but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="284.31" dur="3.99">important for their health and it is</text>
  <text start="286.38" dur="5.88">basically my my version of health</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="5.67">insurance for them and you know how did</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="4.35">I get into this well I got into this</text>
  <text start="293.97" dur="3.21">because I had a dog a dog I loved very</text>
  <text start="296.61" dur="2.46">much</text>
  <text start="297.18" dur="4.5">I&amp;#39;m hope I found her on the side of the</text>
  <text start="299.07" dur="5.91">road and you know she was kind of a pup</text>
  <text start="301.68" dur="4.62">at the time and Shh I didn&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="304.98" dur="3.42">was sticking up out of the grass but</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="3.87">these these gigantic ears it was some</text>
  <text start="308.4" dur="4.44">kind of Corgi mixed with a German</text>
  <text start="310.17" dur="5.73">Shepherd a weird-looking dogs just short</text>
  <text start="312.84" dur="5.25">and she had gigantic bat ears but that</text>
  <text start="315.9" dur="4.38">was a smart dog she was such a good dog</text>
  <text start="318.09" dur="4.89">and and that dog had some dental</text>
  <text start="320.28" dur="5.79">problems and nothing major she needed</text>
  <text start="322.98" dur="4.38">some some you know help from the vet vet</text>
  <text start="326.07" dur="3.54">wouldn&amp;#39;t see her without me given her a</text>
  <text start="327.36" dur="5.63">vaccine so I had to give her vaccine and</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="7.05">then not long after she died in my arms</text>
  <text start="332.99" dur="4.9">because I had to put her down I had to</text>
  <text start="336.66" dur="4.08">go to the vet and get them to put her</text>
  <text start="337.89" dur="4.53">down as I couldn&amp;#39;t do it and the reason</text>
  <text start="340.74" dur="3.21">is because she was having bubble gum</text>
  <text start="342.42" dur="3.72">seizures and her brain was just not</text>
  <text start="343.95" dur="5.88">working right anymore okay she was just</text>
  <text start="346.14" dur="5.25">crying and in pain and I had you know</text>
  <text start="349.83" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s what had missed what I had to do</text>
  <text start="351.39" dur="4.44">so with the dogs I have now I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="353.55" dur="3.6">to go through that stuff again and this</text>
  <text start="355.83" dur="3.45">is my health insurance plan for them</text>
  <text start="357.15" dur="4.71">this is the the way that nature designed</text>
  <text start="359.28" dur="3.96">them to eat especially cats I mean dogs</text>
  <text start="361.86" dur="2.55">are a little bit more opportunist and</text>
  <text start="363.24" dur="2.85">they like things like you know</text>
  <text start="364.41" dur="4.32">vegetables and fruit sometimes - like</text>
  <text start="366.09" dur="9.51">Hachi here loves blueberries crazy dog</text>
  <text start="368.73" dur="8.34">but you know there&amp;#39;s that now I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="375.6" dur="3.21">this discussion many a time and I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="377.07" dur="3.06">this debate many a time and I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="378.81" dur="2.97">remember all of the details because</text>
  <text start="380.13" dur="3.57">there&amp;#39;s so many arguments against being</text>
  <text start="381.78" dur="4.56">a vegan being a vegan will destroy your</text>
  <text start="383.7" dur="4.26">health by the way and it could take 12</text>
  <text start="386.34" dur="4.59">or so I think like 12 years or so -</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="5.67">deplete your b12 and things like that so</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="3.989">you will eventually mess up your health</text>
  <text start="393.63" dur="2.67">fortunately most people back out of</text>
  <text start="394.919" dur="3.511">being a vegan very quickly because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="396.3" dur="3.149">so tough because it&amp;#39;s so unnatural it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="398.43" dur="3.69">not a historically proof</text>
  <text start="399.449" dur="4.59">diet now vegetarianism is a historically</text>
  <text start="402.12" dur="3.96">proven diet in India they&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="404.039" dur="4.62">largely vegetarian right cows are sacred</text>
  <text start="406.08" dur="4.41">so you can be a vegetarian and you can</text>
  <text start="408.659" dur="5.16">do that healthy and and more power to</text>
  <text start="410.49" dur="5.25">you sure I love things like bone broths</text>
  <text start="413.819" dur="4.53">and stuff especially when I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="415.74" dur="4.259">like kill my cavities and stuff when I</text>
  <text start="418.349" dur="3.99">cracked that tooth bone broth is a big</text>
  <text start="419.999" dur="3.72">part of that okay because my dog were</text>
  <text start="422.339" dur="3.45">playing with me and bumped me in the</text>
  <text start="423.719" dur="4.44">head you know the chin and cracked this</text>
  <text start="425.789" dur="3.87">tooth but you know if you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="428.159" dur="2.79">just save animals lives and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="429.659" dur="3.54">trying to be a vegan to save animals</text>
  <text start="430.949" dur="3.601">lives well think of this modern if</text>
  <text start="433.199" dur="3.15">you&amp;#39;re not growing your own food in a</text>
  <text start="434.55" dur="3.209">permaculture sense then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="436.349" dur="2.611">contributing and I don&amp;#39;t mean to be mean</text>
  <text start="437.759" dur="3.21">about this you&amp;#39;re contributing to</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="4.019">millions of small animals in these</text>
  <text start="440.969" dur="4.2">fields being destroyed and their homes</text>
  <text start="442.979" dur="4.62">being destroyed and then being killed by</text>
  <text start="445.169" dur="4.83">these large machines in industrial</text>
  <text start="447.599" dur="3.75">agriculture every year and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="449.999" dur="2.76">contributing to the destruction of the</text>
  <text start="451.349" dur="3.12">environment because that sort of farming</text>
  <text start="452.759" dur="4.08">is basically the most destructive thing</text>
  <text start="454.469" dur="5.1">on the planet to the environment so this</text>
  <text start="456.839" dur="5.97">is not a clear-cut black-and-white</text>
  <text start="459.569" dur="6.03">situation there are many good reasons to</text>
  <text start="462.809" dur="7.17">to be involved with meat and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="465.599" dur="6.771">many bad things about not so you know I</text>
  <text start="469.979" dur="6.12">just wanted to point that out</text>
  <text start="472.37" dur="7.329">you know also there&amp;#39;s a few other</text>
  <text start="476.099" dur="5.34">arguments but what were they there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="479.699" dur="4.8">many different ones and I&amp;#39;m kind of just</text>
  <text start="481.439" dur="5.121">going off of memory here you know I</text>
  <text start="484.499" dur="4.91">think I covered the bar if I covered the</text>
  <text start="486.56" dur="6.479">animal health and stuff like that ah</text>
  <text start="489.409" dur="6.461">that&amp;#39;s most of it I guess right there</text>
  <text start="493.039" dur="5.05">yeah I can&amp;#39;t remember the rest of it but</text>
  <text start="495.87" dur="4.109">you guys kind of get the point you know</text>
  <text start="498.089" dur="3.271">meat is healthy in many ways like</text>
  <text start="499.979" dur="2.97">especially healthy fats and stuff</text>
  <text start="501.36" dur="5.01">depending on how its raised oh and the</text>
  <text start="502.949" dur="5.64">other point I want to make I&amp;#39;ll use deer</text>
  <text start="506.37" dur="4.109">as an example because we&amp;#39;ve killed all</text>
  <text start="508.589" dur="3.421">the wolves unfortunately you know or</text>
  <text start="510.479" dur="2.881">whatever you know we we had a</text>
  <text start="512.01" dur="4.649">competition and we won that competition</text>
  <text start="513.36" dur="4.529">so the wolves are gone so what happens</text>
  <text start="516.659" dur="2.73">to the prey animals that they were</text>
  <text start="517.889" dur="3.15">keeping in balance well if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="519.389" dur="3.661">have hunters and you don&amp;#39;t go out and</text>
  <text start="521.039" dur="4.891">hunt the deer and deplete and thin the</text>
  <text start="523.05" dur="4.289">population what&amp;#39;s gonna happen these</text>
  <text start="525.93" dur="2.759">deer are gonna over populate they&amp;#39;re</text>
