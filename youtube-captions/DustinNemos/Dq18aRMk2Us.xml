  <text start="43.809" dur="6.871">issues I can&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t touch on yes</text>

  <text start="61.78" dur="6.39">there was a good guy with a gun and it</text>
  <text start="64.39" dur="6">ended in about 60 seconds I start</text>
  <text start="68.17" dur="3.57">contrast of course the MSM are probably</text>
  <text start="70.39" dur="3.24">gonna leave that out I haven&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="71.74" dur="3.629">looked to have any bothered to check</text>
  <text start="73.63" dur="6.21">because I know how they operate I know</text>
  <text start="75.369" dur="6.361">what their mo is and it was in Maryland</text>
  <text start="79.84" dur="5.99">which is a state that has fairly strict</text>
  <text start="81.73" dur="7.35">gun control laws already now former</text>
  <text start="85.83" dur="6.64">French president Sarkozy was actually</text>
  <text start="89.08" dur="6.45">arrested and it&amp;#39;s in connection to</text>
  <text start="92.47" dur="7.74">monies received by Muammar Gaddafi of</text>
  <text start="95.53" dur="7.44">Libya before Gaddafi was killed and then</text>
  <text start="100.21" dur="4.949">you know it stands to reason and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="102.97" dur="4.89">been alleged that he and Clinton had</text>
  <text start="105.159" dur="4.021">Gaddafi killed now we also know that he</text>
  <text start="107.86" dur="2.91">was planning on doing on your gold back</text>
  <text start="109.18" dur="3.18">currency and then that would have thrown</text>
  <text start="110.77" dur="3.18">the whole system out of whack there was</text>
  <text start="112.36" dur="3.689">a lot of people that wanted him dead so</text>
  <text start="113.95" dur="3.63">you know I don&amp;#39;t know for sure about how</text>
  <text start="116.049" dur="3.571">I feel about this one but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="117.58" dur="5.3">definitely worth mentioning he&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="119.62" dur="5.97">held for questioning and it has come out</text>
  <text start="122.88" dur="5.499">allegedly that he ordered French assets</text>
  <text start="125.59" dur="5.1">to infiltrate the crowd where Gaddafi</text>
  <text start="128.379" dur="5.011">was found hiding in that like drainpipe</text>
  <text start="130.69" dur="5.03">and basically makes sure that he was</text>
  <text start="133.39" dur="2.33">finished</text>
  <text start="136.719" dur="7.481">in regards to the Cambridge analytic</text>
  <text start="140.48" dur="5.569">scandal Facebook is holding a crisis</text>
  <text start="144.2" dur="8.25">meeting and it&amp;#39;s doing so without</text>
  <text start="146.049" dur="8.921">Zuckerberg which is interesting and the</text>
  <text start="152.45" dur="4.8">DOJ Inspector General is examining</text>
  <text start="154.97" dur="6.15">whether McCabe was promised a promotion</text>
  <text start="157.25" dur="8.04">to FBI director by Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="161.12" dur="6.269">that&amp;#39;s a biggie I mean of course right</text>
  <text start="165.29" dur="3.809">with everything else that we know he was</text>
  <text start="167.389" dur="3.511">getting something out of it more than</text>
  <text start="169.099" dur="6.931">probably just that money that his wife</text>
  <text start="170.9" dur="6.419">received from her in in qa9 world real</text>
  <text start="176.03" dur="3.06">fast then I&amp;#39;m gonna go back to the Magus</text>
  <text start="177.319" dur="5.57">tough it&amp;#39;s in my notes here to mention</text>
  <text start="179.09" dur="9.299">the original be account which was banned</text>
  <text start="182.889" dur="7.03">reinstated then banned and then not</text>
  <text start="188.389" dur="3.99">reinstated it was actually hacked open I</text>
  <text start="189.919" dur="5.07">guess and then banned again and then</text>
  <text start="192.379" dur="5.401">attacked open again by anonymous has now</text>
  <text start="194.989" dur="5.041">changed again and it&amp;#39;s now called Bailey</text>
  <text start="197.78" dur="5.489">Olsen with a picture of a redheaded</text>
  <text start="200.03" dur="4.41">girls face I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="203.269" dur="3.241">her I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s an attempt to</text>
  <text start="204.44" dur="4.019">doctor or what obviously she lost</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="3.78">control of that account a while back and</text>
  <text start="208.459" dur="5.25">anonymous was running it even though it</text>
  <text start="210.29" dur="5.039">had been banned twice and before the ban</text>
  <text start="213.709" dur="3.661">there was weird stuff happening as well</text>
  <text start="215.329" dur="4.38">like it was basically being wiped of</text>
  <text start="217.37" dur="4.14">past tweets it was like one tweet left</text>
  <text start="219.709" dur="4.56">and the image had changed and it could</text>
  <text start="221.51" dur="3.99">change from B to Bailey and just a lot</text>
  <text start="224.269" dur="2.701">of weird stuff is going on with that</text>
  <text start="225.5" dur="6.769">account it&amp;#39;s kind of worth mentioning</text>
  <text start="226.97" dur="5.299">because that account is one of the most</text>
  <text start="232.54" dur="5.979">active tweeters on the whole Twitter</text>
  <text start="235.639" dur="7.111">website as far as queuing on stuff goes</text>
  <text start="238.519" dur="6.271">or at least was before the hack there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="242.75" dur="4.409">another B account now that may or may</text>
  <text start="244.79" dur="6.39">not actually be the original being and</text>
  <text start="247.159" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s called past proves future instead</text>
  <text start="251.18" dur="5.339">of future past it&amp;#39;s kind of a reverse</text>
  <text start="252.919" dur="6.03">and it has been kind of picking up where</text>
  <text start="256.519" dur="4.261">she left off I guess with just lots of</text>
  <text start="258.949" dur="4.051">news lots of tweets good interesting</text>
  <text start="260.78" dur="4.92">place to follow if you&amp;#39;re really really</text>
  <text start="263" dur="3.99">really like thumb on the pulse of the</text>
  <text start="265.7" dur="6.43">queue and on thing</text>
  <text start="266.99" dur="7.33">now back to terrorism news there was a</text>
  <text start="272.13" dur="5.64">fifth bombing attack in Austin since</text>
  <text start="274.32" dur="5.46">March 2nd multiple victims were white</text>
  <text start="277.77" dur="4.05">and the MSM is trying to push the</text>
  <text start="279.78" dur="4.83">narrative that it was a racist attack</text>
  <text start="281.82" dur="4.65">against people of color so don&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="3.48">them push the narrative you have to push</text>
  <text start="286.47" dur="6.6">back against that kind of thing because</text>
  <text start="288.09" dur="6.78">it&amp;#39;s very easy to prove basically</text>
  <text start="293.07" dur="5.58">there&amp;#39;s a double standard at work with</text>
  <text start="294.87" dur="7.2">this Cambridge analytic a thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="298.65" dur="8.57">going on Trump campaign may have used</text>
  <text start="302.07" dur="8.55">some information from this firm to</text>
  <text start="307.22" dur="7.51">target their ads and such with the whole</text>
  <text start="310.62" dur="6.06">voting election issue and you know I</text>
  <text start="314.73" dur="3.42">haven&amp;#39;t seen anything you know I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="316.68" dur="3.12">seen anything when I was reading over</text>
  <text start="318.15" dur="3.36">this story that made me think that this</text>
  <text start="319.8" dur="3.33">was a particularly immoral thing</text>
  <text start="321.51" dur="3.48">obviously we don&amp;#39;t like these companies</text>
  <text start="323.13" dur="4.32">harvesting information and then selling</text>
  <text start="324.99" dur="5.46">it but it seems that what they were</text>
  <text start="327.45" dur="5.61">doing was a voluntary even even basing</text>
  <text start="330.45" dur="6.09">some of the stuff off polls and things</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="6.03">like that so they&amp;#39;re making a really big</text>
  <text start="336.54" dur="5.52">deal out of Trump having benefited from</text>
  <text start="339.09" dur="4.17">information harvested from users which i</text>
  <text start="342.06" dur="2.67">think is wonderful because it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="343.26" dur="2.88">backfire on them because they do it all</text>
  <text start="344.73" dur="3.3">the time for everyone else especially</text>
  <text start="346.14" dur="4.65">now that there&amp;#39;s so much heat already on</text>
  <text start="348.03" dur="4.89">the big three tech companies with</text>
  <text start="350.79" dur="6.15">censorship you know Twitter Facebook</text>
  <text start="352.92" dur="8.4">Google / YouTube I can&amp;#39;t them is one</text>
  <text start="356.94" dur="6.96">because Google owns it so it can&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="361.32" dur="5.49">their cause to try to project this onto</text>
  <text start="363.9" dur="4.8">Trump and just create more anti Facebook</text>
  <text start="366.81" dur="4.17">anger because it&amp;#39;s just gonna be used</text>
  <text start="368.7" dur="4.71">against them later on when we crack down</text>
  <text start="370.98" dur="3.64">on censorship and the SEC is already</text>
  <text start="373.41" dur="5.26">investigating them</text>
  <text start="374.62" dur="7.8">so worth mentioning though worth</text>
  <text start="378.67" dur="6.36">pointing out is that oh you know Trump</text>
  <text start="382.42" dur="9.15">did this or allegedly did this and got</text>
  <text start="385.03" dur="8.82">some information Obama&amp;#39;s campaign or a</text>
  <text start="391.57" dur="4.23">figure from Obama&amp;#39;s campaign Carol</text>
  <text start="393.85" dur="4.89">Davidson actually admits that Democrats</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="6.93">sucked out quote the entire social</text>
  <text start="398.74" dur="5.84">network of the US ok unquote they kept</text>
  <text start="402.73" dur="4.26">the data and they still have that data</text>
  <text start="404.58" dur="4.83">Facebook was entirely okay with this so</text>
  <text start="406.99" dur="5.79">there&amp;#39;s a double standard Trump did this</text>
  <text start="409.41" dur="7.15">to target votes with ads I guess and</text>
  <text start="412.78" dur="6.03">then Obama did this and stole all this</text>
  <text start="416.56" dur="4.98">information OTT stole that you know kind</text>
  <text start="418.81" dur="4.14">of a morally harvested or you might say</text>
  <text start="421.54" dur="2.76">I morally I mean it&amp;#39;s kind of standard</text>
  <text start="422.95" dur="4.32">business practice these days it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="424.3" dur="4.98">exactly a wonderful thing but I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="427.27" dur="4.11">really even call it a VAT immoral I mean</text>
  <text start="429.28" dur="4.62">you you basically who doesn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="431.38" dur="3.66">already that they&amp;#39;re giving away all</text>
  <text start="433.9" dur="2.37">this private information about</text>
  <text start="435.04" dur="6.03">themselves when they sign up for these</text>
  <text start="436.27" dur="7.95">things Obama did this and they praised</text>
  <text start="441.07" dur="6.09">it as a genius move at the time so you</text>
  <text start="444.22" dur="6.33">know more of a way to push back against</text>
  <text start="447.16" dur="5.88">this this onslaught and the narrative</text>
  <text start="450.55" dur="4.04">that&amp;#39;s coming that you know Trump spied</text>
  <text start="453.04" dur="4.41">on everybody or something like that</text>
  <text start="454.59" dur="4.39">they&amp;#39;ll use it you have to be ready with</text>
  <text start="457.45" dur="4.65">your tools to negate it</text>
  <text start="458.98" dur="4.53">so that&amp;#39;s just how it is obviously on my</text>
  <text start="462.1" dur="2.94">channel I&amp;#39;m gonna give you kind of the</text>
  <text start="463.51" dur="3.24">official narrative that&amp;#39;s going and then</text>
  <text start="465.04" dur="4.22">I&amp;#39;m gonna try to give you the</text>
  <text start="466.75" dur="5.58">information that you need to push back I</text>
  <text start="469.26" dur="4.99">like to talk about debates sometimes in</text>
  <text start="472.33" dur="3.45">the ways that you go about doing that</text>
  <text start="474.25" dur="6.26">I&amp;#39;ve mentioned in the past the most</text>
  <text start="475.78" dur="9.03">common approaches are appeal to ridicule</text>
  <text start="480.51" dur="7.24">ad hominem and of course like bandwagon</text>
  <text start="484.81" dur="4.68">where and and straw man is very common</text>
  <text start="487.75" dur="3.75">as well so those four if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="489.49" dur="4.44">familiar with those four or if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="491.5" dur="4.01">not familiar with logical fallacies go</text>
  <text start="493.93" dur="4.11">look them up it&amp;#39;ll take you five minutes</text>
  <text start="495.51" dur="5.68">there&amp;#39;s a website called your logical</text>
  <text start="498.04" dur="4.86">fallacy is dot-com I think it is has all</text>
  <text start="501.19" dur="4.56">the logical fallacies fallacies that are</text>
  <text start="502.9" dur="5.07">really common and you&amp;#39;ll be amazed at</text>
  <text start="505.75" dur="2.52">how how everything changes when you</text>
  <text start="507.97" dur="1.74">learn</text>
  <text start="508.27" dur="4.08">these because you&amp;#39;ll start to really</text>
  <text start="509.71" dur="4.65">recognize them and it will never work on</text>
  <text start="512.35" dur="3.57">you again it&amp;#39;s almost like I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="514.36" dur="5.81">believe in vaccines but it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="515.92" dur="8.73">being immunized against BS and</text>
  <text start="520.17" dur="5.98">manipulation tactics in debate I never</text>
  <text start="524.65" dur="3.96">worked after I learned about them I</text>
  <text start="526.15" dur="3.93">never ever missed it when they tried to</text>
  <text start="528.61" dur="4.89">do it again I was always like oh that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.08" dur="5.79">that&amp;#39;s this one or that&amp;#39;s that one now</text>
  <text start="533.5" dur="4.26">interestingly here okay this is a big</text>
  <text start="535.87" dur="3.45">big deal it may not seem like a big deal</text>
  <text start="537.76" dur="3.69">because it&amp;#39;s just a poll it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="539.32" dur="5.22">two polls but the majority of America</text>
  <text start="541.45" dur="5.79">now believes in the deep state okay this</text>
  <text start="544.54" dur="5.7">is a major milestone milestone talk</text>
  <text start="547.24" dur="6">towards victory and from all places this</text>
  <text start="550.24" dur="4.71">originated with Politico which is</text>
  <text start="553.24" dur="4.16">generally if it was a very leftist into</text>
  <text start="554.95" dur="4.8">Tsongas place I have got I&amp;#39;ve got them</text>
  <text start="557.4" dur="5.32">featured prominently and my folders</text>
  <text start="559.75" dur="5.82">about fake news because there&amp;#39;s just so</text>
  <text start="562.72" dur="4.74">many examples so if I were to ever</text>
  <text start="565.57" dur="2.4">debate someone on Politico there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="567.46" dur="2.37">in trouble</text>
  <text start="567.97" dur="6.36">because I can just drop links like all</text>
  <text start="569.83" dur="6.48">day and also the Monmouth or Monmouth</text>
  <text start="574.33" dur="5.16">inaros a University Polling Institute</text>
  <text start="576.31" dur="5.85">found that no less than 74 percent of</text>
  <text start="579.49" dur="4.35">Americans believe in a deep state when</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="4.65">it is described as a collection of</text>
  <text start="583.84" dur="5.58">unelected officials running policy only</text>
  <text start="586.81" dur="7.14">21% do not believe this kind of group</text>
  <text start="589.42" dur="6.03">exists so follow the culture war if you</text>
  <text start="593.95" dur="4.38">want to know where things are going</text>
  <text start="595.45" dur="5.13">obviously in culture we&amp;#39;ve now learned</text>
  <text start="598.33" dur="4.11">recently in the last year to fake news</text>
  <text start="600.58" dur="3.6">is legitimate issue it&amp;#39;s a household</text>
  <text start="602.44" dur="3.87">name we&amp;#39;ve learned about things like</text>
  <text start="604.18" dur="5.64">deep state that is now a household name</text>
  <text start="606.31" dur="5.1">okay people are starting to kind of get</text>
  <text start="609.82" dur="3.12">the collective consciousness of</text>
  <text start="611.41" dur="3.15">definitions for these things in their</text>
  <text start="612.94" dur="5.12">brains that kind of understanding what</text>
  <text start="614.56" dur="8.81">that means what that is okay</text>
  <text start="618.06" dur="7.27">it&amp;#39;s a massive cultural victory okay and</text>
  <text start="623.37" dur="4.42">politics a balance sheet from culture</text>
  <text start="625.33" dur="6.48">like Breitbart set</text>
  <text start="627.79" dur="5.94">now moving on the newbie account on</text>
  <text start="631.81" dur="4.92">Twitter that I mentioned and others</text>
  <text start="633.73" dur="4.56">including Liz croakin are actually</text>
  <text start="636.73" dur="3.9">saying that they&amp;#39;ve heard that Podesta</text>
  <text start="638.29" dur="6.75">is arrested he said Podesta is arrested</text>
  <text start="640.63" dur="8.79">I could not find any any sauce or horror</text>
  <text start="645.04" dur="6.51">or sources on that Liz is saying that</text>

  <text start="1387.109" dur="4.95">know we&amp;#39;ve been through all of it here</text>
  <text start="1389.229" dur="5.08">including being banned there is a</text>
  <text start="1392.059" dur="3.99">disagreement between certain youtubers</text>
  <text start="1394.309" dur="4.23">in fact you&amp;#39;ll notice this if you watch</text>
  <text start="1396.049" dur="4.35">my video earlier where I joined Victor&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1398.539" dur="3.45">libertas and other youtubers and kind of</text>
  <text start="1400.399" dur="5.7">a roundtable discussion about the</text>
  <text start="1401.989" dur="5.94">censorship we we were discussing this</text>
  <text start="1406.099" dur="4.111">and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a schism between us</text>
  <text start="1407.929" dur="4.141">as to some of us think we should still</text>
  <text start="1410.21" dur="3.389">try to be on YouTube as much as we can</text>
  <text start="1412.07" dur="4.38">and talk about the things that we can</text>
  <text start="1413.599" dur="4.41">talk about and try to bring people to</text>
  <text start="1416.45" dur="3.059">other platforms and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="1418.009" dur="4.29">I fall in I think that we should at</text>
  <text start="1419.509" dur="6">least try to use YouTube to bring people</text>
  <text start="1422.299" dur="4.92">to other platforms but if this is the</text>
  <text start="1425.509" dur="3.99">only platform that you&amp;#39;re seeing me on I</text>
  <text start="1427.219" dur="3.87">think respectfully that you&amp;#39;re making a</text>
  <text start="1429.499" dur="3.331">mistake because it&amp;#39;s only a matter of</text>
  <text start="1431.089" dur="4.29">time folks it&amp;#39;s not gonna last</text>
  <text start="1432.83" dur="5">they are going to ban me again I called</text>
  <text start="1435.379" dur="4.831">it the first time calling it this time</text>
  <text start="1437.83" dur="3.639">and they&amp;#39;re gonna ban others as well and</text>
  <text start="1440.21" dur="2.909">they&amp;#39;re gonna shut down pretty much</text>
  <text start="1441.469" dur="4.14">everybody I think Alex Jones will be</text>
  <text start="1443.119" dur="5.79">last if if ever with him because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1445.609" dur="5.67">such a massive platform but those of us</text>
  <text start="1448.909" dur="7.83">who don&amp;#39;t have millions of dollars and</text>
  <text start="1451.279" dur="10.74">millions of subscribers are Sol alright</text>
  <text start="1456.739" dur="7.711">so if you want to do your part to fight</text>
  <text start="1462.019" dur="5.25">these these tyrants who think they can</text>
  <text start="1464.45" dur="5.579">control what you think and what you see</text>
  <text start="1467.269" dur="6.96">and what information you are able to to</text>
  <text start="1470.029" dur="6.9">watch then please make the move make the</text>
  <text start="1474.229" dur="4.981">move to Vimeo or to bid shoot or to D to</text>
  <text start="1476.929" dur="4.651">buy no D Tube is still kind of new and</text>
  <text start="1479.21" dur="3.839">they&amp;#39;re still they have they have to get</text>
  <text start="1481.58" dur="4.079">things working out they you know they</text>
  <text start="1483.049" dur="4.021">don&amp;#39;t have an app they they still have</text>
  <text start="1485.659" dur="3.24">growing pains to go through they just</text>
  <text start="1487.07" dur="3.659">recently announced they&amp;#39;ve just upgraded</text>
  <text start="1488.899" dur="4.11">to HD and everything they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="1490.729" dur="5.31">very fast platform in many ways because</text>
  <text start="1493.009" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re based on the blockchain and it</text>
  <text start="1496.039" dur="3.18">would make it much more difficult to be</text>
  <text start="1497.479" dur="3.99">banned or censored there because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1499.219" dur="3.231">decentralized there&amp;#39;s no executive that</text>
  <text start="1501.469" dur="3.621">can come in and</text>
  <text start="1502.45" dur="6.51">ban me on D tube and that goes for other</text>
  <text start="1505.09" dur="6.18">youtubers as well and another thing</text>
  <text start="1508.96" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s worth mentioning many of you know</text>
  <text start="1511.27" dur="5.37">that I support cryptocurrencies but that</text>
  <text start="1513.46" dur="4.65">aside and the idea of you believing that</text>
  <text start="1516.64" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re good or bad or any of that</text>
  <text start="1518.11" dur="4.89">doesn&amp;#39;t matter for this crypto</text>
  <text start="1521.14" dur="3.96">currencies are a great way to support</text>
  <text start="1523" dur="4.29">your favorite content creators all right</text>
  <text start="1525.1" dur="5.22">because you can&amp;#39;t they can&amp;#39;t stop them</text>
  <text start="1527.29" dur="4.83">they no one can stop you or silence you</text>
  <text start="1530.32" dur="3.57">from sending some Bitcoin or some</text>
  <text start="1532.12" dur="3.84">aetherium or some light coin or</text>
  <text start="1533.89" dur="3.66">something to your favorite youtubers and</text>
  <text start="1535.96" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;ll be glad to take it if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1537.55" dur="3.63">already just let them know most of them</text>
  <text start="1539.47" dur="5.28">will set it up so that they can get the</text>
  <text start="1541.18" dur="5.91">cryptos I don&amp;#39;t get a lot of Kryptos but</text>
  <text start="1544.75" dur="5.16">I wish I did because it makes it a lot</text>
  <text start="1547.09" dur="5.27">simpler than having to worry about what</text>
  <text start="1549.91" dur="4.86">account that I build up like GoFundMe</text>
  <text start="1552.36" dur="5.41">did really well you know I mean like</text>
  <text start="1554.77" dur="4.92">thirty five hundred dollars on that to</text>
  <text start="1557.77" dur="4.56">support my work here and then they</text>
  <text start="1559.69" dur="7.47">banned me didn&amp;#39;t even get to keep all of</text>
  <text start="1562.33" dur="7.29">it so rather than having that burden on</text>
  <text start="1567.16" dur="5.76">us content creators of trying to figure</text>
  <text start="1569.62" dur="5.76">out a way to make our bills you know do</text>
  <text start="1572.92" dur="4.08">do what you can but also I encourage you</text>
  <text start="1575.38" dur="4.17">to look into maybe just buying enough</text>
  <text start="1577" dur="5.16">Bitcoin or aetherium or whatever it is</text>
  <text start="1579.55" dur="5.67">bitcoins the simplest local bitcoins</text>
  <text start="1582.16" dur="6.3">calm has easy one-page guides as to what</text>
  <text start="1585.22" dur="4.77">to do to buy it very simple process it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1588.46" dur="5.1">not as complicated as people make it out</text>
  <text start="1589.99" dur="5.52">to be and that will help you and help us</text>
  <text start="1593.56" dur="3.78">at the same time because that means that</text>
  <text start="1595.51" dur="4.23">you can support the content you want to</text>
  <text start="1597.34" dur="4.23">see without being censored without even</text>
  <text start="1599.74" dur="3.81">the possibility or even the temptation</text>
  <text start="1601.57" dur="5.25">of censoring you because no one has the</text>
  <text start="1603.55" dur="5.1">button to ban you on kryptos just like</text>
  <text start="1606.82" dur="6.3">with the decentralized platforms bitch</text>
  <text start="1608.65" dur="7.43">shoot indeed tube those are both without</text>
  <text start="1613.12" dur="6.21">an executive without a leader that can</text>
  <text start="1616.08" dur="5.59">exercise power to ban you okay now I</text>
  <text start="1619.33" dur="4.65">think they have a different system with</text>
  <text start="1621.67" dur="4.23">like consensus things like that maybe</text>
  <text start="1623.98" dur="5.7">things can be banned but it&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>
  <text start="1625.9" dur="6.38">difficult to do it so just as a way to</text>
  <text start="1629.68" dur="4.55">fund your content creators</text>
  <text start="1632.28" dur="4.53">even if you don&amp;#39;t like crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="1634.23" dur="5.64">or think that they&amp;#39;re a scam they work</text>
  <text start="1636.81" dur="5.13">you know and most of us content creators</text>
  <text start="1639.87" dur="3.42">here are pretty poor so we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1641.94" dur="4.32">actually be holding it in crypto for</text>
  <text start="1643.29" dur="4.5">long anyway we&amp;#39;ll be cashing it into</text>
  <text start="1646.26" dur="5.49">cash probably as soon as you send it to</text>
  <text start="1647.79" dur="10.17">us so it&amp;#39;s basically like sending as</text>
  <text start="1651.75" dur="9.54">cash now I think that is almost all of</text>
  <text start="1657.96" dur="5.28">it I do want to mention kind of in light</text>
  <text start="1661.29" dur="3.71">of that that 26 million Americans</text>
  <text start="1663.24" dur="4.92">according to this Zero Hedge article</text>
  <text start="1665" dur="7.72">already own crypto currencies okay and</text>
  <text start="1668.16" dur="5.94">8% more planned to buy soon so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1672.72" dur="4.65">talked about it before we&amp;#39;re at that</text>
  <text start="1674.1" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re at that point in the graph if you</text>
  <text start="1677.37" dur="3.27">were to look there&amp;#39;s been like a small</text>
  <text start="1679.08" dur="2.64">amount of the population like less than</text>
  <text start="1680.64" dur="4.05">two and a half percent of the population</text>
  <text start="1681.72" dur="5.58">have actually used and bought Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="1684.69" dur="4.62">too now but we&amp;#39;re about to hit that next</text>
  <text start="1687.3" dur="4.98">step where it goes way up to like ten to</text>
  <text start="1689.31" dur="6.44">fifteen percent and there&amp;#39;s still a lot</text>
  <text start="1692.28" dur="9.8">of money to be made I think and buying</text>
  <text start="1695.75" dur="9.46">cryptos and when the mass of people</text>
  <text start="1702.08" dur="5.8">actually catch on and it goes from ten</text>
  <text start="1705.21" dur="4.56">to like fifty to sixty percent of the</text>
  <text start="1707.88" dur="3.36">population there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s trillions as</text>
  <text start="1709.77" dur="3.42">hundreds of trillions of dollars in</text>
  <text start="1711.24" dur="3.45">demand for real money out there we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1713.19" dur="5.25">not we&amp;#39;re at a couple billion hundred</text>
  <text start="1714.69" dur="5.82">billion I think with Kryptos so to 300</text>
  <text start="1718.44" dur="4.56">billion dollars versus 200 trillion</text>
  <text start="1720.51" dur="4.83">dollars of actual demand for good money</text>
  <text start="1723" dur="5.73">out there I think that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1725.34" dur="5.01">definitely an upshot I think that it has</text>
  <text start="1728.73" dur="3.6">proven to be fairly resistant to being</text>
  <text start="1730.35" dur="4.47">pushed down for very long even though</text>
  <text start="1732.33" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s down right now because of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1734.82" dur="4.35">going on with a mountain GOG situation</text>
  <text start="1736.62" dur="5.96">and the trusty dumping 20,000 Bitcoin at</text>
  <text start="1739.17" dur="5.34">a time on the market won&amp;#39;t last long</text>
  <text start="1742.58" dur="4">he&amp;#39;ll keep doing it a few more times</text>
  <text start="1744.51" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;ll the price we&amp;#39;ll be doing this for</text>
  <text start="1746.58" dur="4.71">a while and then I think that&amp;#39;s just a</text>
