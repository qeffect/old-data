  <text start="10.53" dur="7.71">very short video about EMF Wi-Fi five G</text>
  <text start="14.79" dur="5.03">4G smart meters all of that stuff now</text>
  <text start="18.24" dur="4.08">I&amp;#39;ve been talking to you guys about my</text>
  <text start="19.82" dur="5.17">my knot creation I didn&amp;#39;t create</text>
  <text start="22.32" dur="5.64">anything but I found a solution to 5g</text>
  <text start="24.99" dur="5.22">for home purposes for when you&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="27.96" dur="4.259">house for when you&amp;#39;re sleeping for when</text>
  <text start="30.21" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;re on your couch for when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="32.219" dur="3.481">when your baby&amp;#39;s in the crib you know</text>
  <text start="34.14" dur="3.75">all of this stuff you know I spend a lot</text>
  <text start="35.7" dur="4.53">of time at home so for me this is a this</text>
  <text start="37.89" dur="5.34">is a big solution for you you may not be</text>
  <text start="40.23" dur="5.52">an indoor type this will at least help</text>
  <text start="43.23" dur="3.96">you when you&amp;#39;re sleeping now I want to</text>
  <text start="45.75" dur="2.52">first show you guys a real quick video</text>
  <text start="47.19" dur="3.45">so check this out</text>
  <text start="48.27" dur="5.699">I often get asked just how effective</text>
  <text start="50.64" dur="6.599">Sean got is against electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="53.969" dur="6.18">radiation so what I did was I went out</text>
  <text start="57.239" dur="5.671">and I got myself an electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="60.149" dur="5.16">radiation detector and we have a piece</text>
  <text start="62.91" dur="5.31">of Sean right here now this is a phone</text>
  <text start="65.309" dur="4.951">plate these go on the back of your</text>
  <text start="68.22" dur="4.649">electronic devices have double-sided</text>
  <text start="70.26" dur="5.67">stickers and as you can see it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="5.911">big piece of Sean guys now we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="75.93" dur="5.22">to do a test on it and an easiest way to</text>
  <text start="78.78" dur="5.49">do it is just on a microwave so if we</text>
  <text start="81.15" dur="5.31">turn the device on you&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="84.27" dur="6.12">reading and then as you go closer to the</text>
  <text start="86.46" dur="6.659">microwave then as you can see it goes up</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="4.71">and it&amp;#39;s beeping because it&amp;#39;s obvious</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="4.081">here an alarm and it&amp;#39;s going off the</text>
  <text start="95.1" dur="5.55">chart now we put this young guy in</text>
  <text start="97.2" dur="6.27">between and what happens we take our</text>
  <text start="100.65" dur="5.009">reading down to next to nothing as you</text>
  <text start="103.47" dur="4.56">can see this young guy is in between</text>
  <text start="105.659" dur="5.28">those sensor so it&amp;#39;s sensing what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="108.03" dur="5.64">coming out and the microwave itself and</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s taken the reading down to basically</text>
  <text start="113.67" dur="3.989">nothing that&amp;#39;s just how effective Sean</text>
  <text start="115.619" dur="5.57">got is now if we take the Sean right</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="9.331">away we&amp;#39;re up off the chart again</text>
  <text start="121.189" dur="8.38">beeping an alarm and back in and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="126.99" dur="6.53">down again that is just how effective</text>
  <text start="129.569" dur="6.781">this fantastic stuff Sean got is</text>
  <text start="133.52" dur="6.19">so now that you&amp;#39;ve seen that okay there</text>
  <text start="136.35" dur="5.25">are somewhere around 20,000 plus Studies</text>
  <text start="139.71" dur="3.84">on the harmful effects of this</text>
  <text start="141.6" dur="4.5">electromagnetic radiation on animals</text>
  <text start="143.55" dur="5.37">okay and we are you know we&amp;#39;re animal</text>
  <text start="146.1" dur="4.62">plus we&amp;#39;re something very similar to an</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="3.63">animal so you know I think we are</text>
  <text start="150.72" dur="3.9">animals and I want to talk about this</text>
  <text start="152.55" dur="3.51">solution that I came up with now you</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="3.69">guys have heard me talk about Shung</text>
  <text start="156.06" dur="4.32">guide it comes in many forms I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="158.31" dur="5.7">the like cheap rock form it comes in</text>
  <text start="160.38" dur="5.67">like smooth little pebbles I&amp;#39;ve got the</text>
  <text start="164.01" dur="3.54">company that I&amp;#39;m gonna talk about in a</text>

  <text start="178.59" dur="3.03">you can get the little one that goes on</text>
  <text start="179.79" dur="3.75">the back of your phone like you just saw</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="3.39">in the video that they were using that</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="3.78">little tiny one and that that&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="185.01" dur="4.68">like cheap solution I have an Amazon</text>
  <text start="187.32" dur="4.919">link you can look on there but I want to</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="4.83">talk about shunga com okay because this</text>
  <text start="192.239" dur="4.981">is like directly from the Russian mines</text>
  <text start="194.52" dur="4.26">where this stuff comes from and it is a</text>
  <text start="197.22" dur="4.23">lot cheaper for what I want to talk</text>

  <text start="210.78" dur="3.989">affiliate link from Sean guide if you</text>
  <text start="212.549" dur="3.901">appreciate this I hope you do because I</text>
  <text start="214.769" dur="4.351">don&amp;#39;t think anyone solved the 5g problem</text>
  <text start="216.45" dur="5.52">yet so maybe this is a good deal for</text>
  <text start="219.12" dur="5.13">both of us but jean-guy comm offers</text>
  <text start="221.97" dur="4.68">these large quantities small quantities</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="4.38">whatever of shunga powder at a very</text>
  <text start="226.65" dur="3.99">affordable rate okay now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.63" dur="3.51">International shipping so you know it</text>
  <text start="230.64" dur="3.33">may be a little high on the shipping</text>
  <text start="232.14" dur="3.59">cost and you may be able to shop around</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="4.26">and find a better deal on some powder</text>
  <text start="235.73" dur="4.33">somewhere else I remember I spent about</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="4.8">20 dollars worth of shunga powder I</text>
  <text start="240.06" dur="5.76">mixed it in my paint when I painted this</text>
  <text start="243.03" dur="5.58">new apartment and I painted basically</text>
  <text start="245.82" dur="4.139">the exterior walls I painted like the</text>
  <text start="248.61" dur="3.45">large living room and I painted the</text>
  <text start="249.959" dur="4.5">bedroom I haven&amp;#39;t got my office done I</text>
  <text start="252.06" dur="4.709">ran out of powder but you know I covered</text>
  <text start="254.459" dur="4.891">the area where my baby and wife are all</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="4.44">the time where I sleep and you know that</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="3.93">covers two of my walls in the office</text>

  <text start="263.28" dur="4.91">around my office area so it</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="5.01">helps a little bit you know if if we can</text>
  <text start="268.19" dur="3.78">extrapolate that the powder works like</text>
  <text start="270.08" dur="3.33">the solid which I think it does and I</text>
  <text start="271.97" dur="3.63">haven&amp;#39;t tested this with an EMF meter</text>
  <text start="273.41" dur="4.02">because they&amp;#39;re the nice ones that test</text>
  <text start="275.6" dur="3">for like smart meter radiation are very</text>
  <text start="277.43" dur="4.23">expensive</text>
  <text start="278.6" dur="5.64">someone did very graciously offered to</text>
  <text start="281.66" dur="4.53">to ship me theirs and let me use it and</text>
  <text start="284.24" dur="3.3">send it back and I haven&amp;#39;t heard back</text>
  <text start="286.19" dur="3.9">about that and hopefully that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.54" dur="4.26">something I can show you guys soon but I</text>
  <text start="290.09" dur="3.48">just wanted to mention this because this</text>
  <text start="291.8" dur="4.05">is a solution and this stuff is rolling</text>
  <text start="293.57" dur="3.93">out okay your desk ornaments they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="295.85" dur="4.32">cool they&amp;#39;re on Amazon you can get these</text>
  <text start="297.5" dur="3.66">if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re well off and you</text>

  <text start="301.16" dur="3.93">nicer they actually have one that looks</text>
  <text start="303.26" dur="3">like a really pretty silver version and</text>
  <text start="305.09" dur="2.85">that&amp;#39;s called elite shunga</text>
  <text start="306.26" dur="4.17">which is like a more concentrated</text>
  <text start="307.94" dur="4.35">version but as you could tell any cheap</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="3.57">old Shung guide is gonna do a lot for</text>
  <text start="312.29" dur="2.19">your radiation okay look at what it just</text>

  <text start="316.82" dur="3.81">microwaves are a big source of it</text>
  <text start="318.4" dur="4.84">ironically they&amp;#39;ve banned microwaves in</text>
  <text start="320.63" dur="4.2">Russia last I checked so I guess they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.24" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re pretty smart in terms of health</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="3.6">stuff I mean they they are one of the</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="4.62">largest exporters organic food now and</text>

  <text start="330.98" dur="3.81">understand</text>
  <text start="331.63" dur="5.2">apparently they understand shunga pretty</text>
  <text start="334.79" dur="3.81">well so it&amp;#39;s kind of an interesting</text>
  <text start="336.83" dur="3.57">little thing from nature that helps to</text>
  <text start="338.6" dur="4.2">protect us once again nature usually</text>

  <text start="371.81" dur="4.77">the effects of the 5g are going to be</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="4.86">you know a lot of cataracts a lot of you</text>

  <text start="408.65" dur="4.56">planet with what are you gonna do then</text>

  <text start="527.15" dur="4.02">in the windows and such you know your</text>
  <text start="529.73" dur="2.35">your glass is still going to be an</text>
  <text start="531.17" dur="2.14">entryway for</text>
  <text start="532.08" dur="2.46">some of this radiation you know maybe</text>
  <text start="533.31" dur="3.68">you got big windows or maybe you got</text>
  <text start="534.54" dur="5.43">windows all over the house whatever</text>
  <text start="536.99" dur="4.12">there is another solution for this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.97" dur="3.48">a little bit more expensive but you can</text>
  <text start="541.11" dur="3.95">get the UV window treatments which I</text>
  <text start="543.45" dur="4.35">think also really improve your</text>
  <text start="545.06" dur="3.94">insulation that might be two different</text>
  <text start="547.8" dur="2.82">kinds of treatments so I could be I</text>
  <text start="549" dur="3.27">could be wrong about that but you know</text>
  <text start="550.62" dur="4.23">your windows are a big part of your loss</text>
  <text start="552.27" dur="4.47">of you know hot or cold depending on</text>
  <text start="554.85" dur="5.31">what you&amp;#39;re doing your energy loss</text>
  <text start="556.74" dur="5.58">that&amp;#39;s like 10 20 30 % of it I think so</text>
  <text start="560.16" dur="4.11">this is a great thing that you can do to</text>
  <text start="562.32" dur="3.06">prevent the UV rays from coming in if</text>
  <text start="564.27" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re concerned about that</text>
  <text start="565.38" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;m not because I need more UV rays but</text>
  <text start="568.2" dur="4.11">you know if you&amp;#39;re concerned about that</text>
  <text start="569.82" dur="3.9">great but this will also these things</text>
  <text start="572.31" dur="3.57">whatever they&amp;#39;re made of will also do a</text>
  <text start="573.72" dur="7.11">pretty good job of blocking this thing</text>
  <text start="575.88" dur="6.18">so you know Wi-Fi smart meters 4G 5g any</text>
  <text start="580.83" dur="2.85">of that stuff</text>
  <text start="582.06" dur="3.3">it will attenuate and make the waves</text>
  <text start="583.68" dur="3.06">safer I don&amp;#39;t even think that it blocked</text>
  <text start="585.36" dur="4.11">signal I haven&amp;#39;t had any signal issues</text>
  <text start="586.74" dur="5.13">since I painted a signal still seems to</text>
  <text start="589.47" dur="7.41">work it just makes it less harmful on</text>
  <text start="591.87" dur="6.72">some electromagnetic level that&amp;#39;s most</text>
  <text start="596.88" dur="5.79">of what I wanted to talk about with this</text>
  <text start="598.59" dur="6.51">I think 5g and radiation is is a scary</text>
  <text start="602.67" dur="4.05">topic the smart meters are a scary topic</text>
  <text start="605.1" dur="3.93">and you know there&amp;#39;s a whole lot of</text>
  <text start="606.72" dur="4.08">solutions even retail level you can get</text>
  <text start="609.03" dur="3.42">this thing that that just clamps on to</text>
  <text start="610.8" dur="3.96">your smart meter outside and and</text>
  <text start="612.45" dur="4.32">protects you from from that and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="614.76" dur="3.36">that&amp;#39;s okay too they have it so that</text>
  <text start="616.77" dur="2.85">it&amp;#39;ll fit different types of smart</text>
  <text start="618.12" dur="4.23">meters and just fit right on there and</text>
  <text start="619.62" dur="4.2">you can just click it in but rather than</text>
  <text start="622.35" dur="3.09">have to buy one of those things there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="623.82" dur="4.08">you know there&amp;#39;s options that you can do</text>
  <text start="625.44" dur="3.9">if you don&amp;#39;t want to go and paint your</text>
  <text start="627.9" dur="3.03">entire house and you just have some</text>
  <text start="629.34" dur="4.05">smart meters well my original plan</text>
  <text start="630.93" dur="3.93">before I found out about mixing it with</text>
  <text start="633.39" dur="4.56">paint and my head I guess thought about</text>
  <text start="634.86" dur="5.31">it my original plan was to just take a</text>
  <text start="637.95" dur="3.78">large cardboard box something that maybe</text>
  <text start="640.17" dur="5.19">like a furniture box kind of size</text>
  <text start="641.73" dur="5.61">biggest I could get and then mesh the</text>
  <text start="645.36" dur="4.56">two sides of the cardboard of the box</text>
  <text start="647.34" dur="4.38">over some Shung white powder and some</text>
  <text start="649.92" dur="3.54">Elmer&amp;#39;s glue and just kind of spread it</text>
  <text start="651.72" dur="5.4">out there like a paste and let it glue</text>
  <text start="653.46" dur="6.18">down and then put that on the wall on</text>
  <text start="657.12" dur="5.73">the inside of the house right in front</text>
  <text start="659.64" dur="5.52">of the smart meters because that sort of</text>
  <text start="662.85" dur="3.51">works like a calm shape you know sort of</text>
  <text start="665.16" dur="3.15">like a flashlight of your</text>
  <text start="666.36" dur="5.909">locking the flashlight it&amp;#39;s gonna go</text>
  <text start="668.31" dur="6.66">around but not through and and that is</text>
  <text start="672.269" dur="4.411">very very helpful on a budget you could</text>
  <text start="674.97" dur="3.15">do that for like 10 bucks I don&amp;#39;t if you</text>
  <text start="676.68" dur="3.36">got the box laying around some Elmer&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="678.12" dur="4.29">glue and some shunga powder that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="680.04" dur="3.539">very affordable option and imagine you</text>
  <text start="682.41" dur="4.32">know just look up some of the you know</text>
  <text start="683.579" dur="4.591">the videos about smart meters like 5 G&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="686.73" dur="3.33">coming yeah and it&amp;#39;s in a couple places</text>
  <text start="688.17" dur="4.05">but smart meters are here and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="690.06" dur="4.38">pretty dangerous as well and these</text>
  <text start="692.22" dur="3.69">companies you know people are struggling</text>
  <text start="694.44" dur="2.73">and fighting to be able to keep these</text>
  <text start="695.91" dur="2.429">things off their homes and these</text>
  <text start="697.17" dur="3.39">companies are still doing it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="698.339" dur="4.381">still pushing it down our throats</text>
  <text start="700.56" dur="4.35">definitely definitely immoral and I</text>
  <text start="702.72" dur="3.239">can&amp;#39;t wait till we can decentralize all</text>
  <text start="704.91" dur="3.239">of that stuff and get rid of these</text>
  <text start="705.959" dur="4.531">companies but this is an option this</text>
  <text start="708.149" dur="3.571">will help I hope and let me know what</text>
  <text start="710.49" dur="3.24">you think in the comments this is</text>
  <text start="711.72" dur="3.96">something I&amp;#39;m rather proud of because I</text>
  <text start="713.73" dur="4.65">think I like I said I&amp;#39;m the first to</text>
  <text start="715.68" dur="5.07">have done this and you know not to not</text>
  <text start="718.38" dur="4.68">to stroke my ego or anything but I hope</text>
  <text start="720.75" dur="4.8">that it can save possibly thousands of</text>
  <text start="723.06" dur="5.76">lives maybe millions of victims right</text>
  <text start="725.55" dur="5.279">because this stuff is invisible it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="728.82" dur="4.86">slowly vibrating and cooking your cells</text>
  <text start="730.829" dur="4.2">and and causing them to heat up which</text>
  <text start="733.68" dur="3.33">you know eventually causes them to break</text>
  <text start="735.029" dur="4.351">down you take causes things like cancers</text>
  <text start="737.01" dur="4.68">and stuff like that you know look you</text>
  <text start="739.38" dur="3.78">look into your research on the Wi-Fi and</text>
  <text start="741.69" dur="2.97">look into your research on the smart</text>
  <text start="743.16" dur="3.359">meters that&amp;#39;s even worse because it does</text>
  <text start="744.66" dur="3.89">the the fast flicker pulse which is</text>
  <text start="746.519" dur="4.351">which is apparently far more harmful</text>
  <text start="748.55" dur="4.06">especially if you&amp;#39;re in a densely</text>
  <text start="750.87" dur="3.3">populated area where there are probably</text>
  <text start="752.61" dur="2.94">dozens of these things affecting you</text>
