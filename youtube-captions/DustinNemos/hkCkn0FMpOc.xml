  <text start="77.36" dur="5.55">revolution but in miniature what do you</text>
  <text start="79.759" dur="4.5">think yeah and a whole lot more actually</text>
  <text start="82.91" dur="3.9">so hi everybody</text>
  <text start="84.259" dur="4.171">first of all Philip Sam or von</text>
  <text start="86.81" dur="3.12">hotzendorf feeling so I was always</text>
  <text start="88.43" dur="3.36">called in the u.s. the one with the</text>
  <text start="89.93" dur="8.369">longest last name so no one will</text>
  <text start="91.79" dur="7.8">remember it now but yeah so quickly to</text>
  <text start="98.299" dur="3.121">my background I&amp;#39;m from Germany</text>
  <text start="99.59" dur="5.75">originally I live in the US with my</text>
  <text start="101.42" dur="6.809">family though since quite some time and</text>
  <text start="105.34" dur="5.44">yeah I&amp;#39;ve you know I had a long business</text>
  <text start="108.229" dur="4.471">career and you know very small startup</text>
  <text start="110.78" dur="4.949">companies and very large organizations</text>
  <text start="112.7" dur="7.05">and in parallel is a very brain focused</text>
  <text start="115.729" dur="6.361">typical career you know and in parallel</text>
  <text start="119.75" dur="5.22">I developed spiritually quite a bit and</text>
  <text start="122.09" dur="4.8">at some point really became an energetic</text>
  <text start="124.97" dur="4.31">healer so really two paths that are</text>
  <text start="126.89" dur="5.43">completely different from each other and</text>
  <text start="129.28" dur="5.41">over the last several years I&amp;#39;ve really</text>
  <text start="132.32" dur="4.11">connected that and at some point I came</text>
  <text start="134.69" dur="4.65">across the 60 and that was one of those</text>
  <text start="136.43" dur="6.18">moments where you know intuition beats</text>
  <text start="139.34" dur="5.55">anything else where I heard randomly you</text>
  <text start="142.61" dur="5.55">see 60 in some interview I was listening</text>
  <text start="144.89" dur="5.43">to that wasn&amp;#39;t even about see 60 and</text>
  <text start="148.16" dur="4.799">when see 60 was mentioned I immediately</text>
  <text start="150.32" dur="5.61">was like wow I need to put attention on</text>
  <text start="152.959" dur="5.191">that and then the story began so I did</text>
  <text start="155.93" dur="4.77">my research on see 60 then</text>
  <text start="158.15" dur="6.21">quickly started taking c60 also</text>
  <text start="160.7" dur="5.55">producing c60 and it&amp;#39;s been I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="164.36" dur="4.049">know probably about two and a half years</text>
  <text start="166.25" dur="4.829">that I&amp;#39;ve been taking c60 and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.409" dur="6.39">just absolutely amazing stories that</text>
  <text start="171.079" dur="6.181">I&amp;#39;ve come across over this time you know</text>
  <text start="174.799" dur="4.56">with what I&amp;#39;ve noticed personally what</text>
  <text start="177.26" dur="4.589">I&amp;#39;ve noticed in my family and I can talk</text>
  <text start="179.359" dur="4.261">about that and also you know with with</text>
  <text start="181.849" dur="3.991">close friends it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="183.62" dur="4.08">amazing so I&amp;#39;m definitely you know it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="187.7" dur="4.649">topic and then I&amp;#39;m pleased you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="190.459" dur="4.56">having the show to make more people</text>
  <text start="192.349" dur="4.411">aware of it yeah I mean most people</text>
  <text start="195.019" dur="3.511">haven&amp;#39;t even heard of it yeah so you</text>
  <text start="196.76" dur="3.539">know you said you&amp;#39;ve been on it for two</text>
  <text start="198.53" dur="3.78">years you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="200.299" dur="3.421">extensive what if what was your before</text>
  <text start="202.31" dur="4.259">and after like it first</text>
  <text start="203.72" dur="5.07">do you recall yeah so it&amp;#39;s actually more</text>
  <text start="206.569" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s probably two and a half years and</text>
  <text start="208.79" dur="5.52">you know I&amp;#39;ve lived a pretty healthy</text>
  <text start="211.459" dur="6.631">live already since probably a decade you</text>
  <text start="214.31" dur="7.62">know at minimum before that not so much</text>
  <text start="218.09" dur="6.09">but as I developed more you know my</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="4.199">inner spirit that also comes with just</text>
  <text start="224.18" dur="4.11">you know having a good diet and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="226.129" dur="6.181">looking to eat more organic and you know</text>
  <text start="228.29" dur="6.509">just health became a hobby for me and a</text>
  <text start="232.31" dur="4.5">passion in a way and you find out you</text>
  <text start="234.799" dur="4.02">know all these things that are called</text>
  <text start="236.81" dur="4.349">medicine that are not medicine and then</text>
  <text start="238.819" dur="4.2">you bump into all these things that no</text>
  <text start="241.159" dur="4.95">one is allowed to call medicine but that</text>
  <text start="243.019" dur="5.4">are actually medicine and yeah so I I</text>
  <text start="246.109" dur="6.06">can&amp;#39;t say I was unhealthy you know I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="248.419" dur="6.421">national level tennis player and and</text>
  <text start="252.169" dur="6.81">always looked out to exercise a yoga</text>
  <text start="254.84" dur="6.81">teacher too but but still you know from</text>
  <text start="258.979" dur="5.25">that standpoint from when I started c60</text>
  <text start="261.65" dur="4.86">and come what happened in the last two</text>
  <text start="264.229" dur="5.43">and a half years roughly is pretty</text>
  <text start="266.51" dur="6">amazing and just a few things so I used</text>
  <text start="269.659" dur="3.51">to wear glasses and it actually got</text>
  <text start="272.51" dur="3.149">worse</text>
  <text start="273.169" dur="4.771">every year like it typically does when</text>
  <text start="275.659" dur="5.431">you get older I&amp;#39;m 45 by the way so I</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="5.729">don&amp;#39;t know if anybody can see well very</text>
  <text start="281.09" dur="5.759">little brain I&amp;#39;m seeing people keep</text>
  <text start="283.669" dur="5.401">telling me you&amp;#39;re not 45 well I am but</text>
  <text start="286.849" dur="5.29">but anyway so I don&amp;#39;t use glasses</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="5.319">anymore and I noticed that after like</text>
  <text start="292.139" dur="3.99">7-month by the way because I always had</text>
  <text start="294.389" dur="4.141">to wear contacts when I play tennis and</text>
  <text start="296.129" dur="4.56">and then someone I&amp;#39;d taken a break and</text>
  <text start="298.53" dur="3.9">got back on the tennis court and wanted</text>
  <text start="300.689" dur="4.051">to put in my contacts and I just</text>
  <text start="302.43" dur="4.949">couldn&amp;#39;t look through them and I threw</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="3.57">them away but the next one&amp;#39;s in didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="307.379" dur="2.611">worry I was like okay</text>
  <text start="308.31" dur="4.5">screw it I&amp;#39;m just gonna play without</text>
  <text start="309.99" dur="5.039">contacts today and I noticed damn I</text>
  <text start="312.81" dur="4.199">don&amp;#39;t need contacts anymore and at some</text>
  <text start="315.029" dur="5.581">point I went to the eye doctor to just</text>
  <text start="317.009" dur="6.21">confirm and my eyes are not perfect now</text>
  <text start="320.61" dur="5.22">but they&amp;#39;re at an amazing level where I</text>
  <text start="323.219" dur="4.17">neither need contacts nor glasses and</text>
  <text start="325.83" dur="3.239">and the eye doctor was like oh my god</text>
  <text start="327.389" dur="3.691">that&amp;#39;s crazy I mean I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="329.069" dur="4.141">that happened that&amp;#39;s just one thing I</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="4.17">mean more energy is something that most</text>
  <text start="333.21" dur="4.169">people anyway feel but it&amp;#39;s something I</text>
  <text start="335.25" dur="4.77">want to at least mention it&amp;#39;s not more</text>
  <text start="337.379" dur="4.951">energy like coffee you know I mean yeah</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="5.429">you can drink coffee and and but you</text>
  <text start="342.33" dur="6.059">know coffee is unnatural this feeling of</text>
  <text start="345.449" dur="5.851">coffee is there&amp;#39;s a crash you&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="348.389" dur="5.34">and there&amp;#39;s also a crash but with c60</text>
  <text start="351.3" dur="6.179">it&amp;#39;s this totally natural inner balance</text>
  <text start="353.729" dur="5.791">and you&amp;#39;re just focused and so it&amp;#39;s 100%</text>
  <text start="357.479" dur="4.62">you that comes out and nothing</text>
  <text start="359.52" dur="5.759">artificial that makes you be awake or</text>
  <text start="362.099" dur="5.461">something at the same time better sleep</text>
  <text start="365.279" dur="7.98">is one of the things I noticed as well</text>
  <text start="367.56" dur="7.169">and so I actually has funny though</text>
  <text start="373.259" dur="4.801">before this interview I had to take a</text>
  <text start="374.729" dur="4.951">few notes about what I actually witness</text>
  <text start="378.06" dur="3.599">for myself the last one out here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="5.07">because it&amp;#39;s so much I could talk for an</text>
  <text start="381.659" dur="5.341">hour probably but you you forget at some</text>
  <text start="384.75" dur="4.289">point really you know I want to mention</text>
  <text start="387" dur="4.74">and there&amp;#39;s my little one but I wanted</text>
  <text start="389.039" dur="4.921">to mention or go back to briefly before</text>
  <text start="391.74" dur="4.019">we move on you mentioned eyesight you</text>
  <text start="393.96" dur="3.989">know as someone who&amp;#39;s been involved at</text>
  <text start="395.759" dur="3.81">the retail level online with red pill</text>
  <text start="397.949" dur="3.45">living you know I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of</text>
  <text start="399.569" dur="3.84">feedback and and one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="401.399" dur="3.841">things is people saying my vision is</text>
  <text start="403.409" dur="4.68">improving yeah especially with</text>
  <text start="405.24" dur="4.709">age-related macular degeneration so</text>
  <text start="408.089" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s very it&amp;#39;s very interesting you</text>
  <text start="409.949" dur="3.631">brought that up first it seems to be one</text>
  <text start="411.689" dur="3.421">of the most common things and I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="413.58" dur="3.899">make claims obviously neither can you</text>
  <text start="415.11" dur="4.2">but it is as far as experiences and</text>
  <text start="417.479" dur="4.771">feedback goes it&amp;#39;s pretty high up there</text>
  <text start="419.31" dur="4.529">but please continue I&amp;#39;m sorry absolutely</text>
  <text start="422.25" dur="3.54">any we&amp;#39;ve heard it from many people</text>
  <text start="423.839" dur="3.781">actually and it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="425.79" dur="3.84">you know it doesn&amp;#39;t happen overnight it</text>
  <text start="427.62" dur="3.69">really is something that accumulates and</text>
  <text start="429.63" dur="4.23">that&amp;#39;s one of the things also I want to</text>
  <text start="431.31" dur="5.07">say with SUSE 60 is nothing you just</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="5.1">take for a week or two you know like</text>
  <text start="436.38" dur="5.43">some medicine when you have the flu but</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="5.28">is it really accumulates and and and and</text>
  <text start="441.81" dur="5.4">helps you over time so basically I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="444.24" dur="4.86">noticed the longer you take it the more</text>
  <text start="447.21" dur="4.89">it actually helps your body and if you</text>
  <text start="449.1" dur="5.46">think about it how it it helps with the</text>
  <text start="452.1" dur="5.49">telomeres and helps to renew the cells</text>
  <text start="454.56" dur="5.04">and and even get into the bones and</text>
  <text start="457.59" dur="3.72">everything I mean that can take years</text>
  <text start="459.6" dur="5.22">you know depending on how old we are</text>
  <text start="461.31" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;ve lived our lives in environmental</text>
  <text start="464.82" dur="4.35">stress right that comes from everywhere</text>
  <text start="466.56" dur="5.07">and it&amp;#39;s just something that we&amp;#39;ve lived</text>
  <text start="469.17" dur="4.74">with for a long time it&amp;#39;s unnatural in a</text>
  <text start="471.63" dur="5.34">way but that body is great and can adapt</text>
  <text start="473.91" dur="5.48">to anything but c60 just does that for</text>
  <text start="476.97" dur="4.53">the body and and it just takes some time</text>
  <text start="479.39" dur="3.46">another thing I want to mention is since</text>
  <text start="481.5" dur="4.83">you know I&amp;#39;m a national level tennis</text>
  <text start="482.85" dur="7.13">player finished third and in one of the</text>
  <text start="486.33" dur="6.69">Nationals in the US a few years ago and</text>
  <text start="489.98" dur="5.62">it&amp;#39;s yeah and you know</text>
  <text start="493.02" dur="4.65">thanks for the padding bishop that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="495.6" dur="4.17">why I&amp;#39;m saying that requires dedication</text>
  <text start="497.67" dur="4.11">and fitness and such and that means also</text>
  <text start="499.77" dur="5.01">that you&amp;#39;re in tune with your body so</text>
  <text start="501.78" dur="5.93">you know this is like X expert witness</text>
  <text start="504.78" dur="5.79">of like a feedback on it on a you know</text>
  <text start="507.71" dur="5.13">at least a quality level of something</text>
  <text start="510.57" dur="5.82">yeah so I I do think at least that I can</text>
  <text start="512.84" dur="5.5">you know that people can believe what</text>
  <text start="516.39" dur="4.8">I&amp;#39;m saying now and that&amp;#39;s you know I can</text>
  <text start="518.34" dur="6.81">play I was able to play long tennis even</text>
  <text start="521.19" dur="7.2">in you know 90 95 degrees heat and all</text>
  <text start="525.15" dur="4.95">that and but then if you do that for two</text>
  <text start="528.39" dur="4.65">and a half hours or three hours really</text>
  <text start="530.1" dur="5.19">rough match I mean you&amp;#39;re done and and</text>
  <text start="533.04" dur="4.17">it may take you several days to actually</text>
  <text start="535.29" dur="4.83">really recover to your full strengths</text>
  <text start="537.21" dur="6.65">again and we&amp;#39;ll see 60 I can say with</text>
  <text start="540.12" dur="7.53">absolute certainty your recovery time</text>
  <text start="543.86" dur="8.23">speeds up so much it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s incredible</text>
  <text start="547.65" dur="6.69">so the recovery time is maybe is less</text>
  <text start="552.09" dur="5.58">than half of what it used to be and and</text>
  <text start="554.34" dur="4.95">really less than half and and actually</text>
  <text start="557.67" dur="4.14">there&amp;#39;s one thing I didn&amp;#39;t even take the</text>
  <text start="559.29" dur="6.24">and how could I forget that I&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="561.81" dur="7.53">diagnosed with Lyme disease about a year</text>
  <text start="565.53" dur="6.27">and a half ago it was some pie that I</text>
  <text start="569.34" dur="6.39">had gotten in Europe and then I got this</text>
  <text start="571.8" dur="6.42">rash on my thigh and it wouldn&amp;#39;t go away</text>
  <text start="575.73" dur="4.14">and I didn&amp;#39;t think that it could be</text>
  <text start="578.22" dur="3.63">lying disease or anything at first I was</text>
  <text start="579.87" dur="3.54">like it&amp;#39;s weird and I did all kinds of</text>
  <text start="581.85" dur="3.33">stuff and it just wouldn&amp;#39;t go away and</text>
  <text start="583.41" dur="3.63">at some point after several weeks</text>
  <text start="585.18" dur="3.87">I think after seven or eight weeks I</text>
  <text start="587.04" dur="4.5">went to the doctor</text>
  <text start="589.05" dur="4.86">in Memphis and the doctor immediately</text>
  <text start="591.54" dur="6.24">said you have Lyme disease and I was</text>
  <text start="593.91" dur="6.6">like oh that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s well because I</text>
  <text start="597.78" dur="4.47">knew and we I come to that story in a</text>
  <text start="600.51" dur="3.12">moment I knew a lot about Lyme disease</text>
  <text start="602.25" dur="4.5">at that time because of my wife&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="603.63" dur="5.73">history and typically if if it&amp;#39;s after</text>
  <text start="606.75" dur="4.44">three weeks or four weeks the diagnosis</text>
  <text start="609.36" dur="3.75">you you can&amp;#39;t do anything it&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="611.19" dur="6.15">stay you can&amp;#39;t get rid of Lyme disease</text>
  <text start="613.11" dur="6.3">anymore anyway so the doctor suggested</text>
  <text start="617.34" dur="5.37">you you have to take antibiotics now for</text>
  <text start="619.41" dur="4.92">for three weeks and we have to try it</text>
  <text start="622.71" dur="3.53">and typically I don&amp;#39;t take any</text>
  <text start="624.33" dur="4.89">antibiotics or any of that stuff ever</text>
  <text start="626.24" dur="4.87">but you know I tuned in and it was the</text>
  <text start="629.22" dur="4.56">right thing to do at that moment for</text>
  <text start="631.11" dur="4.98">whatever reason I did that and took the</text>
  <text start="633.78" dur="5.1">antibiotics in what I noticed was</text>
  <text start="636.09" dur="4.41">incredible typically so she said you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="638.88" dur="4.08">gonna throw up you&amp;#39;re gonna feel bad</text>
  <text start="640.5" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;re gonna get out of the Sun because</text>
  <text start="642.96" dur="3.78">you&amp;#39;re gonna be red all over you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="645.03" dur="5.13">gonna be tired and feel bad all the time</text>
  <text start="646.74" dur="6.06">I was like okay so what happened was the</text>
  <text start="650.16" dur="5.13">opposite I stayed fit I continued to</text>
  <text start="652.8" dur="5.64">play two and a half hours and 95 degrees</text>
  <text start="655.29" dur="5.85">in the Memphis sweaty heeds tennis and I</text>
  <text start="658.44" dur="5.1">I crushed my opponent on the one day who</text>
  <text start="661.14" dur="4.02">had told I just got diagnosed with Lyme</text>
  <text start="663.54" dur="3.54">disease week ago and I&amp;#39;m taking</text>
  <text start="665.16" dur="3.18">anybody&amp;#39;s knee was like alright I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="667.08" dur="3.48">gonna kill him</text>
  <text start="668.34" dur="4.08">didn&amp;#39;t happen at all and that guy was</text>
  <text start="670.56" dur="5.49">like oh my god if you&amp;#39;re a superhuman</text>
  <text start="672.42" dur="6.06">and I was like I mean that&amp;#39;s crazy but I</text>
  <text start="676.05" dur="5.1">indeed didn&amp;#39;t feel any of the negative</text>
  <text start="678.48" dur="4.92">effects of the medes of the antibiotics</text>
  <text start="681.15" dur="4.59">so I can definitely say from my own</text>
  <text start="683.4" dur="4.71">experience the antibiotics did their job</text>
  <text start="685.74" dur="5.88">and the Lyme disease by the way went</text>
  <text start="688.11" dur="4.77">away completely it seemed that they did</text>
  <text start="691.62" dur="2.88">their job at all the</text>
  <text start="692.88" dur="5.34">negative effects that you typically have</text>
  <text start="694.5" dur="6.87">were somewhat neutralized by the c60 and</text>
  <text start="698.22" dur="4.62">I think that just by itself is probably</text>
  <text start="701.37" dur="3.69">one of the most amazing things that</text>
  <text start="702.84" dur="5.7">happened to myself but no I&amp;#39;m done with</text>
  <text start="705.06" dur="5.64">myself so happy to tell you it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="708.54" dur="5.46">incredible story you mentioned some</text>
  <text start="710.7" dur="5.61">friends and family as well yeah so my</text>
  <text start="714" dur="6.47">wife um she got diagnosed with Lyme</text>
  <text start="716.31" dur="7.26">disease actually and I think it was 2009</text>
  <text start="720.47" dur="7.24">and/or 2010 that was still in Germany</text>
  <text start="723.57" dur="7.05">and unfortunately that was already the</text>
  <text start="727.71" dur="5.67">tick that was about five years prior to</text>
  <text start="730.62" dur="6.26">the diagnosis and and actually what</text>
  <text start="733.38" dur="7.32">happened you know in that time then she</text>
  <text start="736.88" dur="6.64">you know lost her energy she couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="740.7" dur="4.65">sleep well it was just she got pain</text>
  <text start="743.52" dur="4.02">suddenly all over the place and we never</text>
  <text start="745.35" dur="4.8">knew what that was and then you know our</text>
  <text start="747.54" dur="3.99">second one was born and we always</text>
  <text start="750.15" dur="3.21">thought well it&amp;#39;s maybe because of the</text>
  <text start="751.53" dur="3.63">pregnancy or you know it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="753.36" dur="5.25">breastfeeding that it&amp;#39;s just taking all</text>
  <text start="755.16" dur="5.34">energy but no after the fact after it</text>
  <text start="758.61" dur="3.51">was diagnosed we noticed why that</text>
  <text start="760.5" dur="3.15">actually was the case it was the Lyme</text>
  <text start="762.12" dur="3.9">disease and so she had chronic Lyme</text>
  <text start="763.65" dur="4.53">disease and it got to a point then so</text>
  <text start="766.02" dur="5.37">bad that sometimes on days she couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="768.18" dur="4.89">even leave the bed it was ridiculous you</text>
  <text start="771.39" dur="4.02">know she could play maybe two or three</text>
  <text start="773.07" dur="4.32">minutes of tennis and then she was done</text>
  <text start="775.41" dur="4.29">and done for the day or for two days</text>
  <text start="777.39" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s how bad it was and then you know</text>
  <text start="779.7" dur="6.71">we&amp;#39;re very spiritual people and so she</text>
  <text start="783.06" dur="5.67">did a lot of great things that actually</text>
  <text start="786.41" dur="4.78">started to get her really out of that</text>
  <text start="788.73" dur="4.62">because you know we know we don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="791.19" dur="4.47">believe it we know that behind every</text>
  <text start="793.35" dur="4.5">disease there&amp;#39;s something else right</text>
  <text start="795.66" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s nothing that you just encounter you</text>
  <text start="797.85" dur="3.33">know out of well it&amp;#39;s just there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="799.35" dur="3.93">reason so you can get rid of that</text>
  <text start="801.18" dur="4.05">energetically over time but still you</text>
  <text start="803.28" dur="4.35">need to do something like better diet</text>
  <text start="805.23" dur="4.74">and things like that so she got a lot of</text>
  <text start="807.63" dur="4.35">better over time with all the things she</text>
  <text start="809.97" dur="4.47">did with better nutrition&amp;#39;s and actually</text>
  <text start="811.98" dur="4.5">I made it you know my biggest task to</text>
  <text start="814.44" dur="3.48">always find the best stuff for her to</text>
  <text start="816.48" dur="4.74">you know make her better</text>
  <text start="817.92" dur="5.4">and/or huh yeah and then but but some</text>
  <text start="821.22" dur="4.92">things just didn&amp;#39;t go away like</text>
  <text start="823.32" dur="3.22">arthritis for example she had so bad off</text>
  <text start="826.14" dur="2.32">right</text>
  <text start="826.54" dur="4.95">that every winter when it got cold and</text>
  <text start="828.46" dur="4.95">wet you know the whole body would hurt</text>
  <text start="831.49" dur="3.63">like terribly and she would lose all her</text>
  <text start="833.41" dur="5.07">energy and she would also lose all our</text>
  <text start="835.12" dur="5.07">energy when she was under big stress you</text>
  <text start="838.48" dur="4.2">know having a move for example or</text>
  <text start="840.19" dur="5.88">something else big happens and then you</text>
  <text start="842.68" dur="5.31">know that would go away and with c60 all</text>
  <text start="846.07" dur="6.05">that went away completely she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="847.99" dur="8.13">completely symptom free and no arthritis</text>
  <text start="852.12" dur="6.04">ever any more energy like crazy I mean</text>
  <text start="856.12" dur="3.57">she could play tennis if she wanted to</text>
  <text start="858.16" dur="4.08">she doesn&amp;#39;t really play tennis anymore</text>
  <text start="859.69" dur="4.65">but for a long time she did actually</text>
  <text start="862.24" dur="5.42">yoga teacher training after that she</text>
  <text start="864.34" dur="7.32">crossed the Alps in Europe with the bike</text>
  <text start="867.66" dur="6.1">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s unheard of it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="871.66" dur="4.35">crazy and as I said there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="873.76" dur="4.05">components to that and ingredients if</text>
  <text start="876.01" dur="5.36">you will but the c60 was kind of like</text>
  <text start="877.81" dur="7.17">the really last mile that took her from</text>
  <text start="881.37" dur="6.67">still being sick in a way to not being</text>
  <text start="884.98" dur="5.04">sick at all anymore and things happened</text>
  <text start="888.04" dur="4.08">with a Lyme disease that she couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="890.02" dur="4.8">eat fatty foods anymore she couldn&amp;#39;t eat</text>
  <text start="892.12" dur="4.41">any meat anymore no the not eating me</text>
  <text start="894.82" dur="4.74">was actually good because it helped her</text>
  <text start="896.53" dur="4.79">to be vegan for a while which also then</text>
  <text start="899.56" dur="4.47">helped her recovery but but anyway</text>
  <text start="901.32" dur="5.11">gluten next thing right she could not</text>
  <text start="904.03" dur="5.43">tolerate any gluten anymore and guess</text>
  <text start="906.43" dur="4.64">what after now taking c60 also for about</text>
  <text start="909.46" dur="4.14">two years a little more than two years</text>
  <text start="911.07" dur="4.75">she can eat gluten she can eat fatty</text>
  <text start="913.6" dur="4.89">foods she can eat meat not that she</text>
  <text start="915.82" dur="7.17">likes me but if she eats meat no issue</text>
  <text start="918.49" dur="8.79">whatsoever so you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="922.99" dur="6.66">amazing yeah oh man so you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re you</text>
  <text start="927.28" dur="4.41">know hands-on here with some pretty you</text>
  <text start="929.65" dur="3.48">know I don&amp;#39;t use the word miraculous but</text>
  <text start="931.69" dur="3.75">some pretty incredible things I mean</text>
  <text start="933.13" dur="3.06">this is for for people out there who are</text>
  <text start="935.44" dur="3.69">maybe suffering</text>
  <text start="936.19" dur="4.89">hope perhaps yes absolutely and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="939.13" dur="3.33">really calling out to the people that</text>
  <text start="941.08" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t know what to do and especially</text>
  <text start="942.46" dur="3.51">Lyme disease one of the things where I</text>
  <text start="944.23" dur="4.32">mean you constantly meet people that</text>
  <text start="945.97" dur="5.97">have no clue what to do and and they are</text>
  <text start="948.55" dur="5.43">not understood by the general population</text>
  <text start="951.94" dur="4.26">either because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a form of</text>
  <text start="953.98" dur="5.16">disease where you feel like so tired and</text>
  <text start="956.2" dur="3.91">exhausted and pain full inside yourself</text>
  <text start="959.14" dur="3.61">but you</text>
  <text start="960.11" dur="7.349">don&amp;#39;t necessarily look so very sick you</text>
  <text start="962.75" dur="6.209">know like and and and they sometimes you</text>
  <text start="967.459" dur="7.921">know it&amp;#39;s people tell them you know</text>
  <text start="968.959" dur="8.31">you&amp;#39;re just you know exactly and so</text>
  <text start="975.38" dur="3.66">there are things that can be done and</text>
  <text start="977.269" dur="5.161">it&amp;#39;s also something for people to</text>
  <text start="979.04" dur="4.95">realize you know c60 is yes it you know</text>
  <text start="982.43" dur="3.57">you can get more energy just in a few</text>
  <text start="983.99" dur="4.289">days and yes it can help you with a few</text>
  <text start="986" dur="5.13">things very quickly in a few weeks or a</text>
  <text start="988.279" dur="4.62">few months but likes these lasting</text>
  <text start="991.13" dur="4.019">effects like with the allergies that I</text>
  <text start="992.899" dur="6.451">mentioned you know with my wife I mean</text>
  <text start="995.149" dur="6.361">that took a long time I mean probably at</text>
  <text start="999.35" dur="3.96">least a year if not a year and a half</text>
  <text start="1001.51" dur="4.079">until she noticed she could eat meat</text>
  <text start="1003.31" dur="5.79">again and things like that so it does</text>
  <text start="1005.589" dur="6.541">take some time and it is also logical in</text>
  <text start="1009.1" dur="5.729">a way because you know c60 it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1012.13" dur="7.8">cure anything it just helps the body to</text>
  <text start="1014.829" dur="6.781">do his work um and and to to cure you</text>
  <text start="1019.93" dur="4.409">know the body is designed to heal itself</text>
  <text start="1021.61" dur="4.53">right it&amp;#39;s a powerful antioxidant at</text>
  <text start="1024.339" dur="3.301">least and it helps shield the body from</text>
  <text start="1026.14" dur="5.49">some of the free radical damage as well</text>
  <text start="1027.64" dur="5.669">yes so um are there any other incredible</text>
  <text start="1031.63" dur="5.09">stories you know the answers I share</text>
  <text start="1033.309" dur="6.961">with us so now switching quickly back</text>
  <text start="1036.72" dur="5.109">away from humans to to our dog because I</text>
  <text start="1040.27" dur="3.39">think that&amp;#39;s also important for people</text>
  <text start="1041.829" dur="4.651">you know we love our dogs and cats and</text>
  <text start="1043.66" dur="4.95">all that and our dog always had</text>
  <text start="1046.48" dur="3.96">allergies you know it started in very</text>
  <text start="1048.61" dur="2.61">early and and we just couldn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1050.44" dur="3.18">anything about it</text>
  <text start="1051.22" dur="5.01">other than giving our dog a pill every</text>
  <text start="1053.62" dur="5.64">night to not like scratch herself to</text>
  <text start="1056.23" dur="5.189">death because of food and because of</text>
  <text start="1059.26" dur="5.4">like stuff they spray on the lawn</text>
  <text start="1061.419" dur="5.521">outside and and then also she couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1064.66" dur="3.87">ride in the car nor in the plane and</text>
  <text start="1066.94" dur="3.78">since we&amp;#39;re from Europe you know we</text>
  <text start="1068.53" dur="4.74">travel back and forth every now and then</text>
  <text start="1070.72" dur="3.839">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s long but she couldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1073.27" dur="2.909">in the car for more than two or three</text>
  <text start="1074.559" dur="6.24">minutes and then she would you know</text>
  <text start="1076.179" dur="6.901">throw up and so c60 we gave it to her</text>
  <text start="1080.799" dur="4.62">for five or six days and the allergies</text>
  <text start="1083.08" dur="5.01">went away I&amp;#39;m certain the allergies have</text>
  <text start="1085.419" dur="5.401">not come back like in the lasting state</text>
  <text start="1088.09" dur="5.43">so they always came back in between in</text>
  <text start="1090.82" dur="3.52">Memphis when we still lived there when</text>
  <text start="1093.52" dur="2.769">they sprayed</text>
  <text start="1094.34" dur="4.92">lawns outside with with all these</text>
  <text start="1096.289" dur="5.071">pesticides and whatever then for a few</text>
  <text start="1099.26" dur="4.11">weeks she would get the scratching again</text>
  <text start="1101.36" dur="3.419">and we had to give her some pills but</text>
  <text start="1103.37" dur="4.049">because she would you know obviously</text>
  <text start="1104.779" dur="5.191">absorb those toxins dogs died eating</text>
  <text start="1107.419" dur="5.37">those plants yeah yeah and yeah and then</text>
  <text start="1109.97" dur="5.28">but outside of that time no allergies</text>
  <text start="1112.789" dur="6">whatsoever she can no eat everything and</text>
  <text start="1115.25" dur="6.15">and guess what that dog drove with me</text>
  <text start="1118.789" dur="5.64">for fifteen hours in the car from</text>
  <text start="1121.4" dur="6.21">Memphis to New Mexico and was laying</text>
  <text start="1124.429" dur="7.441">there like it was nothing and she can be</text>
  <text start="1127.61" dur="7.38">in the plane for 1214 hours no problem</text>
  <text start="1131.87" dur="6.179">no anxiety no stress no fear nothing and</text>
  <text start="1134.99" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s amazing because the kindest inner</text>
  <text start="1138.049" dur="4.38">balance came back right and that&amp;#39;s maybe</text>
  <text start="1140.45" dur="4.079">something that I don&amp;#39;t know people have</text>
  <text start="1142.429" dur="3.961">not talked about so much about these</text>
  <text start="1144.529" dur="5.491">things like getting your inner balance</text>
  <text start="1146.39" dur="5.37">back is something that is so critical in</text>
  <text start="1150.02" dur="3.93">today&amp;#39;s life because we&amp;#39;re so trapped</text>
  <text start="1151.76" dur="4.83">with everything and we&amp;#39;re so stressed</text>
  <text start="1153.95" dur="3.9">out all the time and c60 does help with</text>
  <text start="1156.59" dur="5.569">that you know from our own experience</text>
  <text start="1157.85" dur="6.689">and from experience with others for sure</text>
  <text start="1162.159" dur="3.88">agreed Wow and that you know I have</text>
  <text start="1164.539" dur="3.901">heard some pretty interesting stories</text>
  <text start="1166.039" dur="4.61">from pet owners as well let me ask</text>
  <text start="1168.44" dur="5.339">because if people do so many different</text>
  <text start="1170.649" dur="6.731">amounts of c60 I heard everything from a</text>
  <text start="1173.779" dur="6.39">drop under the tongue to three spoons a</text>

  <text start="1203.33" dur="4.77">were you tanking just for people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1204.83" dur="5.01">curiosity yeah so the the dog and you</text>
  <text start="1208.1" dur="4.799">know that probably really varies a</text>
  <text start="1209.84" dur="6.559">little bit that the dog is like a 1112</text>
  <text start="1212.899" dur="7.621">pound dog heaven ease so not too big and</text>
  <text start="1216.399" dur="8.26">you know we gave her half a dropper you</text>
  <text start="1220.52" dur="6.96">know these small droppers these was that</text>
  <text start="1224.659" dur="3.571">like 2 4 ounce bottles like those</text>
  <text start="1227.48" dur="2.97">droppers</text>
  <text start="1228.23" dur="4.409">just half the dropper everyday and the</text>
  <text start="1230.45" dur="4.949">food just mix it in and you know you</text>
  <text start="1232.639" dur="5.67">know the dog eats it with no problem</text>
  <text start="1235.399" dur="5.64">make sure you you know that the dog eats</text>
  <text start="1238.309" dur="5.25">the food within like ten minutes or so</text>
  <text start="1241.039" dur="4.651">so don&amp;#39;t put it on and then the dog gets</text>
  <text start="1243.559" dur="4.921">the food at night because you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1245.69" dur="5.219">anything to oxidize really so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1248.48" dur="4.71">just something to watch out for but you</text>
  <text start="1250.909" dur="4.74">know half a dropper and now we&amp;#39;ve I mean</text>
  <text start="1253.19" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;ve sometimes for a week we don&amp;#39;t give</text>
  <text start="1255.649" dur="7.5">her anything then we give her a lot</text>
  <text start="1258.2" dur="7.169">again every day for several weeks and so</text>
  <text start="1263.149" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s about what we do but probably you</text>
  <text start="1265.369" dur="4.351">could get along with just a quarter</text>
  <text start="1267.049" dur="5.791">dropper or you know eighth of a dropper</text>
  <text start="1269.72" dur="5.939">for that type of dog but you know c60 is</text>
  <text start="1272.84" dur="5.13">I mean lip of fullerenes I must say</text>
  <text start="1275.659" dur="4.531">which is c60 and dissolve in oil is</text>
  <text start="1277.97" dur="4.709">non-toxic right I mean you could shuffle</text>
  <text start="1280.19" dur="4.199">add on your dog&amp;#39;s throat like crazy if</text>
  <text start="1282.679" dur="4.5">you wanted to and nothing bad would</text>
  <text start="1284.389" dur="5.79">happen maybe some diarrhea because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1287.179" dur="4.771">the oil but so you can test a little bit</text>
  <text start="1290.179" dur="3.18">also right I mean you don&amp;#39;t have to give</text>
  <text start="1291.95" dur="5.37">too much but don&amp;#39;t give too little</text>
  <text start="1293.359" dur="6.93">either yeah or the coconut yeah and then</text>
  <text start="1297.32" dur="6.03">for for humans I mean what we always say</text>
  <text start="1300.289" dur="5.281">is also that depends on your lifestyle</text>
  <text start="1303.35" dur="4.98">and how healthy you&amp;#39;ve lived and how</text>
  <text start="1305.57" dur="5.729">sick or healthy you are and how big or</text>
  <text start="1308.33" dur="6.209">small you are right weight is a factor</text>
  <text start="1311.299" dur="7.141">but in between all that I guess what you</text>
  <text start="1314.539" dur="6.811">can say is for you know tiny women maybe</text>
  <text start="1318.44" dur="6.9">it&amp;#39;s like a teaspoon to two teaspoons a</text>
  <text start="1321.35" dur="5.73">day and for you know man you know like</text>
  <text start="1325.34" dur="5.01">you and me which is you know kind of</text>
  <text start="1327.08" dur="6.569">like the average size maybe you know um</text>
  <text start="1330.35" dur="5.49">a tablespoon is definitely great one</text>
  <text start="1333.649" dur="3.15">teaspoon would be like the minimum doses</text>
  <text start="1335.84" dur="5.189">that&amp;#39;s kind of like the health</text>
  <text start="1336.799" dur="5.94">maintenance and but it doesn&amp;#39;t do a lot</text>
  <text start="1341.029" dur="3.541">more than just that right so if you</text>
  <text start="1342.739" dur="4.53">really want to work on stuff and you may</text>
  <text start="1344.57" dur="4.62">want improve your vision and and and all</text>
  <text start="1347.269" dur="4.11">that you know I think a tablespoon is</text>
  <text start="1349.19" dur="3.989">fine and then if you&amp;#39;re really tall man</text>
  <text start="1351.379" dur="4.41">maybe a football player or something I</text>
  <text start="1353.179" dur="6.271">mean you probably end up indeed with at</text>
  <text start="1355.789" dur="5.911">least two tablespoons a day and yeah</text>
  <text start="1359.45" dur="4.349">that&amp;#39;s about all I can say and you know</text>
  <text start="1361.7" dur="3.78">and then you&amp;#39;ll find your your way also</text>
  <text start="1363.799" dur="4.081">because you know ask your intuition</text>
  <text start="1365.48" dur="5.1">because that you know the answer to that</text>
  <text start="1367.88" dur="5.039">the one thing to know is just take it on</text>
  <text start="1370.58" dur="4.14">a regular basis you can take it every</text>
  <text start="1372.919" dur="3.571">day that&amp;#39;s probably the easiest for</text>
  <text start="1374.72" dur="3.66">everybody but some people take it once a</text>
  <text start="1376.49" dur="4.86">week but then you have to take seven</text>
  <text start="1378.38" dur="5.429">times as much because you want to have</text>
  <text start="1381.35" dur="5.1">at least you know the the minimum can</text>
  <text start="1383.809" dur="5.61">like weekly level that you hold sure</text>
  <text start="1386.45" dur="4.589">that makes sense so we&amp;#39;ve covered some</text>
  <text start="1389.419" dur="3.771">pretty amazing things I think people out</text>
  <text start="1391.039" dur="5.311">there may may find this very interesting</text>
  <text start="1393.19" dur="4.869">in closing before you know we we shut</text>
  <text start="1396.35" dur="3.929">out is there anything else that you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1398.059" dur="4.201">like to cover or discuss or any other</text>
  <text start="1400.279" dur="6.63">stories you&amp;#39;d like to share yes two</text>
  <text start="1402.26" dur="6.509">stories and try to be brief here but one</text>

  <text start="1433.159" dur="3.48">asked you know if she could could try</text>
  <text start="1434.96" dur="3.42">that because she didn&amp;#39;t know what to do</text>
