  <text start="970.82" dur="4.71">voluntarily and particularly I think</text>
  <text start="972.41" dur="5.19">with someone like Bob Muller making an</text>
  <text start="975.53" dur="3.99">appeal to his patriotism a sense of duty</text>
  <text start="977.6" dur="3.51">is the right way to go but at the end of</text>

  <text start="1131.33" dur="4.11">needs to be able to do that right like</text>
  <text start="1133.13" dur="5.25">he needs to be able to have that sort of</text>
  <text start="1135.44" dur="6.359">public pressure so that he has the the</text>
  <text start="1138.38" dur="5.64">pretext in order to act that kind of</text>
  <text start="1141.799" dur="4.321">thing helps politicians so if we show up</text>
  <text start="1144.02" dur="5.909">in demand hey we want to represent our</text>
  <text start="1146.12" dur="5.52">cue pride then they kick us out but if</text>

  <text start="1154.07" dur="3.81">it</text>
  <text start="1154.34" dur="5.939">so that&amp;#39;s kind of my thoughts and I</text>
  <text start="1157.88" dur="5.01">think it&amp;#39;d be really cool if by 2020 we</text>
  <text start="1160.279" dur="4.471">can openly have a C of Q everywhere and</text>
  <text start="1162.89" dur="3.87">they can&amp;#39;t hide it unless they just</text>
  <text start="1164.75" dur="4.529">don&amp;#39;t cover the events when that be</text>
  <text start="1166.76" dur="4.2">glorious anyway if you&amp;#39;re one of the</text>
  <text start="1169.279" dur="3.181">influencers in these events let me know</text>

  <text start="1182.799" dur="4.48">interesting</text>
  <text start="1184.07" dur="5.28">so Brennan is potentially going to be</text>
  <text start="1187.279" dur="4.441">going down as well that&amp;#39;s a very high</text>
  <text start="1189.35" dur="4.439">level player and the fact that they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1864.52" dur="5.67">immoralities because when you speak in</text>
  <text start="1867.49" dur="5.1">symbols it&amp;#39;s like the ultimate plausible</text>
  <text start="1870.19" dur="5.75">deniability what are you talking about I</text>
  <text start="1872.59" dur="5.67">was just eating a pizza right</text>
  <text start="1875.94" dur="5.56">well yeah it&amp;#39;s perfectly okay to eat</text>
  <text start="1878.26" dur="5.43">pizza I in fact love pizza but in</text>
  <text start="1881.5" dur="4.35">today&amp;#39;s world when you start to see</text>
  <text start="1883.69" dur="5.37">people putting pictures of pizza and</text>
  <text start="1885.85" dur="5.1">children on the same thing well you have</text>
  <text start="1889.06" dur="4.92">to be pretty damn ignorant to do</text>
  <text start="1890.95" dur="4.35">something that&amp;#39;s stupid some people do</text>
  <text start="1893.98" dur="3.84">it out of complete ignorance and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1895.3" dur="6.57">fine but people that should know better</text>
  <text start="1897.82" dur="6.75">who do that are very suspect because of</text>
  <text start="1901.87" dur="4.47">symbolism because we&amp;#39;ve seen the pattern</text>
  <text start="1904.57" dur="5.87">it&amp;#39;s like if you&amp;#39;re walking around</text>
  <text start="1906.34" dur="6.66">wearing a bunch of Bob Marley stuff and</text>
  <text start="1910.44" dur="4.27">there&amp;#39;s a bunch of green everywhere and</text>
  <text start="1913" dur="4.41">there&amp;#39;s like plants and stuff and then</text>
  <text start="1914.71" dur="4.94">possibly some smoke well I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="1917.41" dur="7.2">probably assume that you&amp;#39;re a pothead</text>
  <text start="1919.65" dur="6.61">and it&amp;#39;s usually a safe assumption it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1924.61" dur="4.71">getting to be like that with some of</text>
  <text start="1926.26" dur="8.45">their symbols now too if I see a</text>
  <text start="1929.32" dur="8.04">celebrity if I see a John Legend or</text>
  <text start="1934.71" dur="3.31">Chrissy Teigen or Tigan or Harvey say</text>
  <text start="1937.36" dur="3.27">her name</text>
  <text start="1938.02" dur="6.84">with pizza and their child and a picture</text>
  <text start="1940.63" dur="5.67">together and other odd telltale signs</text>
  <text start="1944.86" dur="3.21">which I&amp;#39;ve covered that you know I hope</text>
  <text start="1946.3" dur="3.81">to break open that whole situation back</text>
  <text start="1948.07" dur="3.87">when when Hugh had first had her plane</text>
  <text start="1950.11" dur="4.5">turned back around I was right there</text>
  <text start="1951.94" dur="4.47">live-chat like reporting on her life</text>
  <text start="1954.61" dur="4.92">chat you know like she&amp;#39;s there being</text>
  <text start="1956.41" dur="5.07">held behind behind closed doors</text>
  <text start="1959.53" dur="3.75">separately from others in the airport</text>
  <text start="1961.48" dur="2.67">not sure what&amp;#39;s going on she&amp;#39;s freaking</text>
  <text start="1963.28" dur="3.09">out</text>
  <text start="1964.15" dur="3.72">returned you know their plane was forced</text>
  <text start="1966.37" dur="5.49">to turn back around which usually</text>
  <text start="1967.87" dur="8.189">doesn&amp;#39;t happen heading to Japan her and</text>
  <text start="1971.86" dur="6.06">John Legend now interesting and as as</text>
  <text start="1976.059" dur="4.711">reporting on that we found so many</text>
  <text start="1977.92" dur="4.259">images of her with pizza symbolism and</text>
  <text start="1980.77" dur="4.37">things like that including her own child</text>
  <text start="1982.179" dur="5.011">you know people ask the question and</text>
  <text start="1985.14" dur="4">it&amp;#39;s a very fair question to ask</text>
  <text start="1987.19" dur="3.57">especially then you see John Legend&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1989.14" dur="6.08">associations would like the Clintons and</text>
  <text start="1990.76" dur="7.2">and others Marina Abramovic remember her</text>
  <text start="1995.22" dur="4">one of their priestess cult types</text>
  <text start="1997.96" dur="2.94">I mean she&amp;#39;s into this stuff very</text>
  <text start="1999.22" dur="7.53">heavily the spirit cooking and all that</text>
  <text start="2000.9" dur="9.54">so symbolism means a lot a lot more than</text>
  <text start="2006.75" dur="5.49">you think sometimes it really is</text>
  <text start="2010.44" dur="3.57">everywhere now also senators reach four</text>

  <text start="2041.19" dur="3.03">a team and then that that&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="2042.45" dur="3.3">group decision I imagine the top</text>
  <text start="2044.22" dur="3.45">Democrat on the panel would provide</text>
  <text start="2045.75" dur="5.85">Trump more than four point five billion</text>
  <text start="2047.67" dur="6.06">for the border funding package so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2051.6" dur="3.99">uh he&amp;#39;s getting some and Mitch McConnell</text>
  <text start="2053.73" dur="3.689">had threatened to force a vote next week</text>
  <text start="2055.59" dur="3.569">in an attempt to make Democrats go on</text>
  <text start="2057.419" dur="3.161">the record blocking humanitarian aid</text>

  <text start="2061.7" dur="4.419">that&amp;#39;s great I love when they do things</text>
  <text start="2064.83" dur="3.45">like this because then you can you know</text>
  <text start="2066.119" dur="2.831">if they if they say no humanitarian aid</text>
  <text start="2068.28" dur="2.29">you know</text>
  <text start="2068.95" dur="4.379">in the papers and then make him look</text>

  <text start="2073.329" dur="4.53">threatened them with so this is a kind</text>
  <text start="2076.119" dur="3.21">of rough games that they&amp;#39;re playing at</text>
  <text start="2077.859" dur="2.76">the high end where they&amp;#39;re really using</text>

  <text start="2089.589" dur="6.06">to go along with this that my friends is</text>
  <text start="2092.98" dur="4.44">an important lesson not that we should</text>
  <text start="2095.649" dur="6.69">use violence or force but that we should</text>
  <text start="2097.42" dur="6.99">understand leverage because they do the</text>
