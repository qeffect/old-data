  <text start="116.04" dur="5.28">their support for us our first story</text>
  <text start="119.73" dur="3.48">comes out of the gateway Punnett six</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="4.11">point two million Americans drop off</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="5.73">food stamps on a Trump saving the</text>
  <text start="125.43" dur="6.389">country 750 million dollars annually so</text>
  <text start="128.94" dur="5.909">that is a lot of money and of course as</text>
  <text start="131.819" dur="5.881">with other welfare programs the bill for</text>
  <text start="134.849" dur="5.101">this is footed by this hacks pair so not</text>
  <text start="137.7" dur="4.56">only is this a good thing because this</text>
  <text start="139.95" dur="6.05">is some of the burden lifted from the</text>
  <text start="142.26" dur="6.63">taxpayer but it&amp;#39;s also an indication of</text>
  <text start="146" dur="7.319">how well we are doing right now</text>
  <text start="148.89" dur="6.9">economically so of course this really is</text>
  <text start="153.319" dur="5.171">reflected also in the fact that we have</text>
  <text start="155.79" dur="4.74">such low unemployment right now and in</text>
  <text start="158.49" dur="3.89">fact we have been hitting records for</text>
  <text start="160.53" dur="4.58">quite some time ever</text>
  <text start="162.38" dur="7.23">President Trump has taken office so we</text>
  <text start="165.11" dur="7.5">have minorities even lowest unemployment</text>
  <text start="169.61" dur="5.04">in history so this is a good thing so</text>
  <text start="172.61" dur="5.7">not only is this another indicator of</text>
  <text start="174.65" dur="7.38">that but when we look at those who were</text>
  <text start="178.31" dur="6.51">trapped in the food stamp cycle of</text>
  <text start="182.03" dur="6.15">poverty this is very beneficial for them</text>
  <text start="184.82" dur="5.82">because now we have people who are no</text>
  <text start="188.18" dur="3.36">longer and they&amp;#39;re no longer dependent</text>
  <text start="190.64" dur="3.81">on the government</text>
  <text start="191.54" dur="5.28">they are self-sufficient this is really</text>
  <text start="194.45" dur="5.22">what the American Dream is all about the</text>
  <text start="196.82" dur="4.92">American Dream is being successful in</text>
  <text start="199.67" dur="5.01">your own right you are self-sufficient</text>
  <text start="201.74" dur="5.19">you are productive and so this is a good</text>
  <text start="204.68" dur="4.2">thing the more we see people being</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="4.02">pulled out of this cycle of the pen of</text>
  <text start="208.88" dur="4.8">dependence the more successful this</text>
  <text start="210.95" dur="4.68">country is going to be overall and this</text>
  <text start="213.68" dur="4.44">is again this is a good thing for those</text>
  <text start="215.63" dur="4.38">folks who have been trapped in that for</text>
  <text start="218.12" dur="5.07">so long because that&amp;#39;s exactly what it</text>
  <text start="220.01" dur="7.47">is as soon as you fall into this welfare</text>
  <text start="223.19" dur="6.03">system it is very difficult to get out</text>
  <text start="227.48" dur="5.4">of it because people become to pin it</text>
  <text start="229.22" dur="5.15">but of course again Democrats love for</text>
  <text start="232.88" dur="5.19">people to be dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="234.37" dur="6.04">they want people to need them they need</text>
  <text start="238.07" dur="5.94">people to need them and that is why they</text>
  <text start="240.41" dur="5.4">push welfare socialism so hard but the</text>
  <text start="244.01" dur="4.95">fact of the matter is it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="245.81" dur="5.07">beneficial and it harms people not only</text>
  <text start="248.96" dur="4.53">does it harm the country overall because</text>
  <text start="250.88" dur="5.729">it reduces productivity but also it just</text>
  <text start="253.49" dur="5.52">harms individuals it really is a system</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="4.891">of oppression so this is a good thing</text>
  <text start="259.01" dur="5.22">that we have so many people who now are</text>
  <text start="261.5" dur="5.55">no longer dependent on food stamps that</text>
  <text start="264.23" dur="5.93">is a good indicator of an excellent</text>
  <text start="267.05" dur="5.34">economy right now we are doing well so</text>
  <text start="270.16" dur="8.11">congratulations to President Trump to</text>
  <text start="272.39" dur="10.77">pulling us out of poverty ok other news</text>
  <text start="278.27" dur="7.38">so a few updates on some of our Democrat</text>
  <text start="283.16" dur="4.11">candidates who really don&amp;#39;t stand a</text>
  <text start="285.65" dur="3.87">chance against President Trump but it is</text>
  <text start="287.27" dur="4.26">interesting to watch them so Elizabeth</text>
  <text start="289.52" dur="5">Warren apparently has teamed up with</text>
  <text start="291.53" dur="4.1">Hillary Clinton so Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="294.52" dur="5.15">refuses</text>
  <text start="295.63" dur="6.81">is to disappear into the background she</text>
  <text start="299.67" dur="4.9">still wants to be relevant in the</text>
  <text start="302.44" dur="6.39">political sphere so she has offered up</text>
  <text start="304.57" dur="6.6">her advice to several of the Democrat</text>
  <text start="308.83" dur="5.88">candidates however the main one who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.17" dur="6.03">really trying to benefit from that</text>
  <text start="314.71" dur="4.32">advice but it&amp;#39;s likely she won&amp;#39;t benefit</text>
  <text start="317.2" dur="3.72">from that advice given the fact that</text>
  <text start="319.03" dur="4.92">Hilary Clinton couldn&amp;#39;t even win a</text>
  <text start="320.92" dur="6.48">rigged election explain that one so</text>
  <text start="323.95" dur="5.1">Warren has been continually talking with</text>
  <text start="327.4" dur="4.74">Hillary Clinton they have an open line</text>
  <text start="329.05" dur="6.45">of communication right now and so they</text>
  <text start="332.14" dur="6.54">are hoping that by teaming up they are</text>
  <text start="335.5" dur="7.26">going to secure the win now here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="338.68" dur="5.73">thing even though they are teaming up</text>
  <text start="342.76" dur="4.17">because they think that that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="344.41" dur="5.73">increase Warren&amp;#39;s chances of taking the</text>
  <text start="346.93" dur="6.38">White House everyone knows that Hillary</text>
  <text start="350.14" dur="6.3">Clinton is a crook even those who</text>
  <text start="353.31" dur="5.17">worship her practically deep down inside</text>
  <text start="356.44" dur="4.23">they know that she&amp;#39;s a crook they just</text>
  <text start="358.48" dur="5.94">don&amp;#39;t want it a minute also Elizabeth</text>
  <text start="360.67" dur="6.93">Warren is a proven liar we know this</text>
  <text start="364.42" dur="7.41">based on the fact that DNA test had</text>
  <text start="367.6" dur="5.67">shown that she virtually has no Indian</text>
  <text start="371.83" dur="3.93">blood in her whatsoever</text>
  <text start="373.27" dur="7.26">virtually next to none it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="375.76" dur="7.38">insignificant the level but she used her</text>
  <text start="380.53" dur="7.83">fake minority status in order to get</text>
  <text start="383.14" dur="8.88">into a prestigious college and she</text>
  <text start="388.36" dur="6.53">continued to tout that lie so she could</text>
  <text start="392.02" dur="5.49">give herself some sort of credibility</text>
  <text start="394.89" dur="4.75">she will never make it to the White</text>
  <text start="397.51" dur="4.74">House but Hillary Clinton is so</text>
  <text start="399.64" dur="4.38">desperate to remain relevant that she</text>
  <text start="402.25" dur="4.44">will attach to anyone who listens to her</text>
  <text start="404.02" dur="4.44">and Elizabeth Warren is so desperate to</text>
  <text start="406.69" dur="3.99">gain the White House that she will</text>
  <text start="408.46" dur="5.48">attach herself to anyone who she thinks</text>
  <text start="410.68" dur="7.14">will help her secure that win both are</text>
  <text start="413.94" dur="5.17">incredibly desperate but we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="417.82" dur="2.7">to worry about them so much I just</text>
  <text start="419.11" dur="5.04">thought it might be interesting to point</text>
  <text start="420.52" dur="5.88">out here that they are teaming up okay</text>
  <text start="424.15" dur="3.87">another presidential candidate who</text>
  <text start="426.4" dur="2.95">really at this point should just drop</text>
  <text start="428.02" dur="6.85">out of the race</text>
  <text start="429.35" dur="8.94">err Bill DeBlasio so yet again he has</text>
  <text start="434.87" dur="5.94">suggested another policy that really</text>
  <text start="438.29" dur="5.18">just is trying to squeeze every tax</text>
  <text start="440.81" dur="6.3">dollar they can out of its citizens so</text>
  <text start="443.47" dur="7.6">the newest thing is he&amp;#39;s suggesting that</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="6.42">maybe cyclists should be required to</text>
  <text start="451.07" dur="7.88">have a license and registration for</text>
  <text start="453.53" dur="8.25">their bicycles really are you kidding me</text>
  <text start="458.95" dur="4.54">can you imagine every single person I</text>
  <text start="461.78" dur="5.43">mean is there gonna be a age limit on</text>
  <text start="463.49" dur="6.42">that then because kids even have</text>
  <text start="467.21" dur="5.28">bicycles and they also have to follow</text>
  <text start="469.91" dur="4.8">the bicycling rules so are they going to</text>
  <text start="472.49" dur="5.04">be required to have a license what is</text>
  <text start="474.71" dur="4.86">the age restriction on that really have</text>
  <text start="477.53" dur="4.11">you thought this out other than the fact</text>
  <text start="479.57" dur="4.59">that you want to squeeze out tax dollars</text>
  <text start="481.64" dur="7.2">from your citizens because really that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="484.16" dur="6.09">what this is about and if you want to</text>
  <text start="488.84" dur="4.89">know the truth of the matter a lot of</text>
  <text start="490.25" dur="5.67">people have opted to bicycle around the</text>
  <text start="493.73" dur="5.73">city going to work or wherever they need</text>
  <text start="495.92" dur="7.86">to go because parking your car in New</text>
  <text start="499.46" dur="6.66">York City is almost more than rent for</text>
  <text start="503.78" dur="5.4">an apartment in New York City it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="506.12" dur="6.87">outrageous amount so of course it is</text>
  <text start="509.18" dur="5.97">more economically sound to ride a</text>
  <text start="512.99" dur="3.84">bicycle instead of having a car taking</text>
  <text start="515.15" dur="4.38">public transportation instead of having</text>
  <text start="516.83" dur="4.61">a car because it&amp;#39;s so expensive now they</text>
  <text start="519.53" dur="8.13">want to tax you for having a bicycle</text>
  <text start="521.44" dur="8.5">this is a terrible idea really but it</text>
  <text start="527.66" dur="4.29">doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me coming from Mayor</text>
  <text start="529.94" dur="9.27">Bill DeBlasio who should just drop out</text>
  <text start="531.95" dur="9.78">now okay Joe Walsh he is accusing</text>
  <text start="539.21" dur="3.98">president Trump of eliminating the</text>
  <text start="541.73" dur="5.22">primary elections</text>
  <text start="543.19" dur="6">so while primary elections in certain</text>
  <text start="546.95" dur="7.65">states have been canceled</text>
  <text start="549.19" dur="5.86">he&amp;#39;s not actually giving all the truth</text>
  <text start="554.6" dur="2.04">here</text>
  <text start="555.05" dur="3.12">he&amp;#39;s saying that it has to do with</text>
  <text start="556.64" dur="3.81">President Trump that he was behind it</text>
  <text start="558.17" dur="3.48">but actually he wasn&amp;#39;t so apparently</text>
  <text start="560.45" dur="6.389">this is a common</text>
  <text start="561.65" dur="8.73">this where a party that already has an</text>
  <text start="566.839" dur="6.841">incumbent may decide to cancel the</text>
  <text start="570.38" dur="4.74">primaries in certain areas so the</text>
  <text start="573.68" dur="4.44">Republican Party because of course</text>
  <text start="575.12" dur="5.07">president Trump is a Republican so the</text>
  <text start="578.12" dur="6.36">Republican Party has decided to cancel</text>
  <text start="580.19" dur="6.78">the primary elections in a few different</text>
  <text start="584.48" dur="5.58">states so we have South Carolina Arizona</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="5.73">Nevada and Kansas so four out of 50</text>
  <text start="590.06" dur="4.05">states have no primary elections at this</text>
  <text start="592.7" dur="3.27">point because they&amp;#39;ve been canceled by</text>
  <text start="594.11" dur="3.81">the Republican Party but this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="6.93">president Trump&amp;#39;s decision this is</text>
  <text start="597.92" dur="7.38">actually a common practice now what I</text>
  <text start="602.9" dur="5.879">will say about this is that this is a</text>
  <text start="605.3" dur="4.89">little bit concerning because and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="608.779" dur="2.971">actually kind of glad that Jill Walsh</text>
  <text start="610.19" dur="5.36">has mentioned something about this even</text>
  <text start="611.75" dur="7.68">if he did tell half of a lie I think</text>
  <text start="615.55" dur="7.24">that it should not really be allowed for</text>
  <text start="619.43" dur="8.22">a party to do this even if they have an</text>
  <text start="622.79" dur="7.35">incumbent in office why because it</text>
  <text start="627.65" dur="8.18">should be allowed for people to vote for</text>
  <text start="630.14" dur="8.52">someone else if they want so let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="635.83" dur="4.87">you&amp;#39;re a Republican but you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="638.66" dur="3.81">actually like President Trump there are</text>
  <text start="640.7" dur="6.35">people who don&amp;#39;t like President Trump</text>
  <text start="642.47" dur="7.77">okay so for those people they won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="647.05" dur="6.97">really allowed to vote for who they want</text>
  <text start="650.24" dur="7.53">to represent them I think the</text>
  <text start="654.02" dur="6.06">opportunities should be there so if</text>
  <text start="657.77" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re gonna make it fair then that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="660.08" dur="3.3">what should happen you should not be</text>
  <text start="661.43" dur="5.3">able to shut down a primary just because</text>
  <text start="663.38" dur="7.92">you already have an incumbent in office</text>
  <text start="666.73" dur="6.43">that belongs to your party so this</text>
  <text start="671.3" dur="6.36">should be addressed where it should be</text>
  <text start="673.16" dur="7.53">changed just to make things fair not</text>
  <text start="677.66" dur="4.47">that anyone is going to be able to beat</text>
  <text start="680.69" dur="4.53">President Trump at this point because</text>
  <text start="682.13" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re doing so well but the opportunity</text>
  <text start="685.22" dur="7.42">should be there that way everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="687.32" dur="9.579">voice can be heard okay in other news</text>
  <text start="692.64" dur="7.68">so Blasi Ford ker lawyer had come out at</text>
  <text start="696.899" dur="7.321">a summit and she made some comments</text>
  <text start="700.32" dur="7.199">regarding all of the testimony that was</text>
  <text start="704.22" dur="6.51">made back when the Cavanaugh hearings</text>
  <text start="707.519" dur="5.25">were occurring so Christine Blasi Ford</text>
  <text start="710.73" dur="9.45">had accused Brett Kavanaugh justice</text>
  <text start="712.769" dur="10.081">Cavanaugh of very serious crimes and in</text>
  <text start="720.18" dur="6.23">fact a whole trove of women had followed</text>
  <text start="722.85" dur="7.53">up behind her making outrageous</text>
  <text start="726.41" dur="5.919">outlandish accusations it seemed as if</text>
  <text start="730.38" dur="5.76">they were kind of making up the story as</text>
  <text start="732.329" dur="5.7">they went along now we already knew that</text>
  <text start="736.14" dur="4.65">there was an agenda that was there</text>
  <text start="738.029" dur="4.861">because they wanted to do whatever they</text>
  <text start="740.79" dur="4.169">could to prevent justice Cavanaugh from</text>
  <text start="742.89" dur="5.31">getting into the Supreme Court because</text>
  <text start="744.959" dur="5.221">he was a conservative justice and they</text>
  <text start="748.2" dur="6.079">needed to keep the Supreme Court more</text>
  <text start="750.18" dur="7.8">liberal so it was dangerous for them and</text>
  <text start="754.279" dur="7.151">of course Roe versus Wade was a major</text>
  <text start="757.98" dur="5.88">issue so they needed to keep justice</text>
  <text start="761.43" dur="5.519">Cavanaugh out and that was the whole</text>
  <text start="763.86" dur="5.58">point of that they nearly destroyed him</text>
  <text start="766.949" dur="5.961">completely him and his family they went</text>
  <text start="769.44" dur="9.74">through they went through hell really</text>
  <text start="772.91" dur="10.72">recently kristinb lassies Ford&amp;#39;s lawyer</text>
  <text start="779.18" dur="5.86">had come out saying that basically</text>
  <text start="783.63" dur="4.769">that&amp;#39;s what they were doing the whole</text>
  <text start="785.04" dur="6.289">agenda was to protect roe versus wade to</text>
  <text start="788.399" dur="5.451">protect abortions the right to abortion</text>
  <text start="791.329" dur="7.63">so now</text>
  <text start="793.85" dur="7.39">Senator Tom Tillis from South Carolina</text>
  <text start="798.959" dur="5.791">North Carolina actually sir excuse me</text>
  <text start="801.24" dur="5.25">North Carolina he has said that they</text>
  <text start="804.75" dur="3.48">should open up investigations into this</text>
  <text start="806.49" dur="3.48">because this should not be allowed and</text>
  <text start="808.23" dur="4.08">really this is the truth of the matter</text>
  <text start="809.97" dur="4.92">because you cannot make false</text>
  <text start="812.31" dur="5.01">accusations any way no matter what no</text>
  <text start="814.89" dur="4.35">matter what the motivation is you cannot</text>
  <text start="817.32" dur="6.09">make a false accusation against someone</text>
  <text start="819.24" dur="5.4">because that is a crime I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="823.41" dur="1.76">people forgot about that</text>
  <text start="824.64" dur="2.989">but that</text>
  <text start="825.17" dur="3.99">is a crime that you can be prosecuted</text>
  <text start="827.629" dur="3.781">for if you make a false accusation</text>
  <text start="829.16" dur="3.989">against someone because you can bring a</text>
  <text start="831.41" dur="7.709">considerable amount of harm to that</text>
  <text start="833.149" dur="9.6">person not limited to possible prison</text>
  <text start="839.119" dur="5.7">time for that person the ruining of</text>
  <text start="842.749" dur="5.221">their life and other aspects as far as</text>
  <text start="844.819" dur="5.85">employment maybe their family there are</text>
  <text start="847.97" dur="4.94">a lot of really negative consequences</text>
  <text start="850.669" dur="7.44">that can come out of a false accusation</text>
  <text start="852.91" dur="11.589">so that is why making a false report is</text>
  <text start="858.109" dur="9.75">a crime now they&amp;#39;re saying that this</text>
  <text start="864.499" dur="6.15">should be investigated because there was</text>
  <text start="867.859" dur="5.1">an agenda so she&amp;#39;s already come out and</text>
  <text start="870.649" dur="4.11">made a public statement saying that</text>
  <text start="872.959" dur="4.021">there was an agenda behind all of that</text>
  <text start="874.759" dur="4.11">and that is why Christine Blasi Ford had</text>
  <text start="876.98" dur="5.549">come forward with her stories because</text>
  <text start="878.869" dur="10.041">they needed to quote put an asterisk</text>
  <text start="882.529" dur="14.28">next to his name we already knew this</text>
  <text start="888.91" dur="10.239">but now now it&amp;#39;s come out publicly so</text>
  <text start="896.809" dur="4.411">I&amp;#39;ll be following this to see what</text>
  <text start="899.149" dur="3.6">happens with this and I really hope that</text>
  <text start="901.22" dur="5.549">some justice can come out of this</text>
  <text start="902.749" dur="6.51">because as far as I know no one was ever</text>
  <text start="906.769" dur="6.42">held accountable for what happened</text>
  <text start="909.259" dur="6.57">during that time no one even to those</text>
  <text start="913.189" dur="5.21">who had been shown that their stories</text>
  <text start="915.829" dur="2.57">were false</text>
  <text start="918.759" dur="5.58">no one was prosecuted for that no one</text>
  <text start="921.86" dur="5.339">was held accountable and that is wrong</text>
  <text start="924.339" dur="5.62">next up really quick we have a Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="927.199" dur="3.93">Epstein updates and it&amp;#39;s not so much as</text>
  <text start="929.959" dur="3.96">an update but a little bit more</text>
  <text start="931.129" dur="5.341">information a little bit more insight so</text>
  <text start="933.919" dur="4.14">we have a reporter here who&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="936.47" dur="3.659">and he&amp;#39;s talking about one of the</text>
  <text start="938.059" dur="3.96">occasions he went to a party at Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="940.129" dur="5.52">Epstein&amp;#39;s mansions one of his mansions</text>
  <text start="942.019" dur="5.49">and he and explained how odd it was when</text>
  <text start="945.649" dur="4.361">he arrived and he was immediately</text>
  <text start="947.509" dur="4.481">offered a massage</text>
  <text start="950.01" dur="3.69">so instead of being offered hors</text>
  <text start="951.99" dur="3.3">d&amp;#39;oeuvres when you come to a party</text>
  <text start="953.7" dur="5.07">you&amp;#39;re offered a massage and we talked</text>
  <text start="955.29" dur="6">about how massage really is code for sex</text>
  <text start="958.77" dur="5.07">and so he himself even mentioned that</text>
  <text start="961.29" dur="5.16">this was strange and that the first</text>
  <text start="963.84" dur="4.38">thing that came to mind was honey trap</text>
  <text start="966.45" dur="3.39">and of course being a reporter it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="968.22" dur="3.51">likely that he&amp;#39;s investigated these</text>
  <text start="969.84" dur="3.72">types of things so he would be familiar</text>
  <text start="971.73" dur="3.95">with that and that&amp;#39;s why that came to</text>
  <text start="973.56" dur="4.05">mind and so he said that this is a</text>
  <text start="975.68" dur="4.36">strategy that is often used by</text>
  <text start="977.61" dur="4.62">intelligence for different purposes</text>
  <text start="980.04" dur="4.65">whether it&amp;#39;s for blackmail whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="982.23" dur="7.8">for gaining information but they use</text>
  <text start="984.69" dur="7.68">women to entice their targets with the</text>
  <text start="990.03" dur="3.57">prospect of sexual pleasures and then</text>
  <text start="992.37" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s how they trap them that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="993.6" dur="5.84">it&amp;#39;s called a honey trap so let&amp;#39;s take a</text>
  <text start="995.97" dur="3.47">listen to what he says about this</text>
  <text start="1001.47" dur="5.31">- bought into one of them stains events</text>
  <text start="1004.2" dur="6.45">in the early nineties I&amp;#39;d say what was</text>
  <text start="1006.78" dur="9.65">the oddest thing me was soon after we</text>
  <text start="1010.65" dur="8.22">had arrived people came up to me and</text>
  <text start="1016.43" dur="13.42">would you like a massage</text>
  <text start="1018.87" dur="13.19">I was extremely certainly not what you</text>
  <text start="1029.85" dur="2.21">do</text>
  <text start="1045.439" dur="7.451">so I think worthy of note here is that</text>
  <text start="1049.71" dur="6.209">this man was a reporter and I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="1052.89" dur="4.86">this isn&amp;#39;t the first or the last person</text>
  <text start="1055.919" dur="5.281">who have ever went to a Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="1057.75" dur="5.909">party where he was approached with the</text>
  <text start="1061.2" dur="7.319">prospect of a quote massage</text>
  <text start="1063.659" dur="7.411">he&amp;#39;s imagined the benefits of having the</text>
  <text start="1068.519" dur="12.061">media in your pocket through this method</text>
  <text start="1071.07" dur="13.56">very clever really because this also</text>
  <text start="1080.58" dur="6.809">would provide an additional cover for</text>
  <text start="1084.63" dur="8.759">this whole operation when you have the</text>
  <text start="1087.389" dur="8.701">media in your pocket huge benefit so</text>
  <text start="1093.389" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s already been said that Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="1096.09" dur="3.78">Epstein was likely an intelligence asset</text>
  <text start="1098.039" dur="4.651">and that&amp;#39;s not too far-fetched either</text>
  <text start="1099.87" dur="7.58">because just Lane Maxwell who was his</text>
  <text start="1102.69" dur="4.76">madam also had intelligence connects</text>
  <text start="1107.779" dur="6.221">likely through Mossad and we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="1112.5" dur="3.389">more about that in detail at a later</text>
  <text start="1114" dur="4.559">time it&amp;#39;s still something I&amp;#39;m sort of</text>
  <text start="1115.889" dur="6.121">working on right now trying to draw out</text>
  <text start="1118.559" dur="9.72">this huge network because they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1122.01" dur="9.169">really connected Jeffrey Epstein his</text>
  <text start="1128.279" dur="9.981">black male sex blackmail operation</text>
  <text start="1131.179" dur="10.271">nexium Hollywood the modeling industry</text>
  <text start="1138.26" dur="9.159">through Leslie Wexner as well as John</text>
  <text start="1141.45" dur="10.92">Luke Grinnell they&amp;#39;re all part of the</text>
  <text start="1147.419" dur="9.291">same network and of course it would be</text>
  <text start="1152.37" dur="6.87">smart for them to trap the media as well</text>
  <text start="1156.71" dur="4.81">okay other new</text>
  <text start="1159.24" dur="4.439">I found this article a couple of days</text>
  <text start="1161.52" dur="5.759">ago when I was looking into that whole</text>
  <text start="1163.679" dur="4.86">case that is surrounding Planned</text>
  <text start="1167.279" dur="4.111">Parenthood right now and in fact</text>
  <text start="1168.539" dur="4.711">actually though that case that had</text>
  <text start="1171.39" dur="3.72">reported on a couple of days ago Planned</text>
  <text start="1173.25" dur="6.049">Parenthood for summaries because</text>
  <text start="1175.11" dur="9.809">probably because they&amp;#39;re so heavily</text>
  <text start="1179.299" dur="8.11">protected they&amp;#39;re so well-connected</text>
  <text start="1184.919" dur="4.711">they&amp;#39;re not the ones who are in trouble</text>
  <text start="1187.409" dur="5.4">right now it&amp;#39;s the reporters who exposed</text>
  <text start="1189.63" dur="5.789">what they were doing so of course the</text>
  <text start="1192.809" dur="5.25">case is going on right now where we have</text>
  <text start="1195.419" dur="5.401">these two reporters who had exposed the</text>
  <text start="1198.059" dur="6.181">fact that Planned Parenthood they were</text>
  <text start="1200.82" dur="9.18">selling baby parts and so this was a big</text>
  <text start="1204.24" dur="8.46">deal but Planned Parenthood is not the</text>
  <text start="1210" dur="4.919">one facing felony charges right now it</text>
  <text start="1212.7" dur="5.16">is the reporters which is a dangerous</text>
  <text start="1214.919" dur="4.14">precedent right now because these</text>
  <text start="1217.86" dur="4.439">reporters of course they would have</text>
  <text start="1219.059" dur="5.34">never been able to reveal those facts</text>
  <text start="1222.299" dur="4.98">without doing what they did which is go</text>
  <text start="1224.399" dur="5.491">undercover for months in order to get</text>
  <text start="1227.279" dur="4.77">that information so regardless I was</text>
  <text start="1229.89" dur="4.47">looking at this more and then I found</text>
  <text start="1232.049" dur="5.461">this article it&amp;#39;s an op-ed by someone</text>
  <text start="1234.36" dur="5.13">who used to be a sex educator she was</text>
  <text start="1237.51" dur="5.49">trained by Planned Parenthood she talks</text>
  <text start="1239.49" dur="6.51">about what she was taught to teach to</text>
  <text start="1243" dur="5.94">our kids our adolescent children who are</text>
  <text start="1246" dur="7.799">not yet in pre-adolescent really we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1248.94" dur="6.51">talking 10 11 12 years old so the</text>
  <text start="1253.799" dur="7.441">curriculum that is taught to these</text>
  <text start="1255.45" dur="8.849">children is not about reproductive</text>
  <text start="1261.24" dur="6.299">health so much as it&amp;#39;s about here let me</text>
  <text start="1264.299" dur="6.781">teach you about how to have sex safely</text>
  <text start="1267.539" dur="5.071">and so this person who wrote this op-ed</text>
  <text start="1271.08" dur="4.589">who was trained by Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="1272.61" dur="7.62">says that when she went through the</text>
  <text start="1275.669" dur="7.051">training they told her to assume that</text>
  <text start="1280.23" dur="6.299">the children have done everything and</text>
  <text start="1282.72" dur="6.12">anything and so you teach in a manner</text>
  <text start="1286.529" dur="4.62">that assumes that these kids know about</text>
  <text start="1288.84" dur="3.9">all of this stuff when really they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1291.149" dur="4.201">their children 10</text>
  <text start="1292.74" dur="5.01">eleven years old 12 years old what do</text>
  <text start="1295.35" dur="4.44">you think they know about anal sex</text>
  <text start="1297.75" dur="7.14">nothing they&amp;#39;re not supposed to know</text>
  <text start="1299.79" dur="9.57">anything about that really so she talks</text>
  <text start="1304.89" dur="6.09">about how they even when they starts</text>
  <text start="1309.36" dur="4.89">they have to start with an icebreaker</text>
  <text start="1310.98" dur="4.86">and the icebreaker really is okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1314.25" dur="6.48">think of all the names you can think of</text>
  <text start="1315.84" dur="6.78">for genitalia and so instead of teaching</text>
  <text start="1320.73" dur="5.19">okay this is the proper name this is a</text>
  <text start="1322.62" dur="4.83">vagina this is a penis they don&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="1325.92" dur="3.78">about there they come up with all these</text>
  <text start="1327.45" dur="3.979">really degrading names so already from</text>
  <text start="1329.7" dur="6.15">the very start</text>
  <text start="1331.429" dur="11.471">they&amp;#39;re demoralizing the holding they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1335.85" dur="10.16">learning to objectify each other this is</text>
  <text start="1342.9" dur="6.45">not good and then also at the same time</text>
  <text start="1346.01" dur="6.43">this woman who is a sex educator she was</text>
  <text start="1349.35" dur="8.31">taught that parents really are a barrier</text>
  <text start="1352.44" dur="7.29">to services and so the only good parent</text>
  <text start="1357.66" dur="5.43">is the parent that buys into their way</text>
  <text start="1359.73" dur="5.699">of thinking and so this is the</text>
  <text start="1363.09" dur="5.4">curriculum that&amp;#39;s pushed on children</text>
  <text start="1365.429" dur="6.421">they they talk about very explicit</text>
  <text start="1368.49" dur="5.22">activities so it&amp;#39;s not just about okay</text>
  <text start="1371.85" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about our body parts</text>
  <text start="1373.71" dur="3.42">and then we&amp;#39;re going to talk about the</text>
  <text start="1375.48" dur="3.949">reproductive system and all that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1377.13" dur="5.87">not about that anymore</text>
  <text start="1379.429" dur="6.491">it&amp;#39;s about hey we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about</text>
  <text start="1383" dur="4.21">regular sex oral sex anal sex we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1385.92" dur="3.63">going to talk about all of that then</text>
  <text start="1387.21" dur="4.349">we&amp;#39;re going to talk to you about STDs</text>
  <text start="1389.55" dur="4.17">then we&amp;#39;re going to talk about how you</text>
  <text start="1391.559" dur="3.841">can protect yourself from those STDs and</text>
  <text start="1393.72" dur="3.87">also we&amp;#39;re gonna talk to you about how</text>
  <text start="1395.4" dur="5.01">you can abort a baby when you become</text>
  <text start="1397.59" dur="5.25">pregnant and you don&amp;#39;t want it because</text>
  <text start="1400.41" dur="5.01">you&amp;#39;re not ready because you&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="1402.84" dur="4.29">sex at 13 years old 12 years old 11</text>
  <text start="1405.42" dur="3.84">years old you&amp;#39;re a kid of course you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1407.13" dur="4.679">not going to be ready for a kid kids</text>
  <text start="1409.26" dur="9.27">having kids but they&amp;#39;re promoting this</text>
  <text start="1411.809" dur="9.541">in schools and also which should be</text>
  <text start="1418.53" dur="6.37">noted here is that the public school</text>
  <text start="1421.35" dur="6.34">system has pushed this</text>
  <text start="1424.9" dur="6.75">now as being part of mandatory</text>
  <text start="1427.69" dur="6.18">curriculum sex education and also</text>
  <text start="1431.65" dur="4.74">Minnesota is an example of this I want</text>
  <text start="1433.87" dur="5.1">to skip over here really quick so</text>
  <text start="1436.39" dur="5.25">Minnesota we have parents fighting back</text>
  <text start="1438.97" dur="8.03">there because a bill was just pushed</text>
  <text start="1441.64" dur="10.8">forward where they now will be requiring</text>
  <text start="1447" dur="10.69">sex education in all pre-k through 12th</text>
  <text start="1452.44" dur="9.45">grade schools that includes elementary</text>
  <text start="1457.69" dur="8.55">schools very young children being</text>
  <text start="1461.89" dur="7.41">exposed to this so Minnesota parents</text>
  <text start="1466.24" dur="5.58">have banded together and now they are</text>
  <text start="1469.3" dur="5.94">fighting against that mandate and they</text>

  <text start="1498.73" dur="7.89">become later clients this is not good</text>
  <text start="1504.64" dur="6.3">okay here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m going to say about</text>
  <text start="1506.62" dur="8.81">sex education I will say that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1510.94" dur="7.17">important for kids to learn about</text>
  <text start="1515.43" dur="4.42">healthy sex and healthy relationships</text>
  <text start="1518.11" dur="8.55">and the reproductive system and all of</text>
  <text start="1519.85" dur="9.96">that right but not in this way in my</text>
  <text start="1526.66" dur="6.42">opinion I think that this should be a</text>
  <text start="1529.81" dur="4.98">topic that parents should be having with</text>
  <text start="1533.08" dur="3.45">their kids they should be having this</text>
  <text start="1534.79" dur="4.32">conversation with their kids is it</text>
  <text start="1536.53" dur="4.77">embarrassing it&amp;#39;s embarrassing but if</text>
  <text start="1539.11" dur="4.74">you have that conversation with your</text>
  <text start="1541.3" dur="4.83">kids you have control over what you tell</text>
  <text start="1543.85" dur="5.69">them you have control over what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1546.13" dur="3.41">exposed to at what time</text>
  <text start="1552.23" dur="9.789">that is extremely important don&amp;#39;t leave</text>
  <text start="1559.919" dur="3.63">it to the public education system and</text>
  <text start="1562.019" dur="3">talk to your kids about this because</text>
  <text start="1563.549" dur="5.73">this is what they&amp;#39;re teaching them</text>
  <text start="1565.019" dur="6.63">Planned Parenthood they are the ones who</text>
  <text start="1569.279" dur="5.791">are largely responsible for the</text>
  <text start="1571.649" dur="6">curriculum that is part of this sex</text>
  <text start="1575.07" dur="3.329">education in schools this should be</text>
  <text start="1577.649" dur="4.351">concerning</text>
  <text start="1578.399" dur="5.91">and so Minnesota should not be the only</text>
  <text start="1582" dur="4.71">state who is pushing against this every</text>
  <text start="1584.309" dur="7.681">state should be doing this every parent</text>
  <text start="1586.71" dur="7.919">should be concerned with this so really</text>
  <text start="1591.99" dur="4.679">instead of it being in schools that</text>
  <text start="1594.629" dur="8.071">curriculum should be taught at home by</text>
  <text start="1596.669" dur="8.431">the parents who have control over it not</text>
  <text start="1602.7" dur="10.02">some company that wants to push</text>
  <text start="1605.1" dur="10.49">abortions and promiscuous promiscuity so</text>
  <text start="1612.72" dur="4.199">we should take the lead from Minnesota</text>
  <text start="1615.59" dur="3.13">all right</text>
  <text start="1616.919" dur="3.571">in other news related to Planned</text>
  <text start="1618.72" dur="4.949">Parenthood of course we know recently</text>
  <text start="1620.49" dur="5.7">they had refused title 10 funding and so</text>
  <text start="1623.669" dur="6">now apparently they&amp;#39;re crying about</text>
  <text start="1626.19" dur="7.609">funds and that they need more donations</text>
  <text start="1629.669" dur="8.25">in order to sustain their activities</text>
  <text start="1633.799" dur="6.941">even though I talked about this a few</text>
  <text start="1637.919" dur="4.89">days ago where that money from title 10</text>
  <text start="1640.74" dur="5.669">is actually just a mere drop in the</text>
  <text start="1642.809" dur="4.921">bucket when compared to the other</text>
  <text start="1646.409" dur="2.99">government funding that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1647.73" dur="5.25">receiving so they are being reimbursed</text>
  <text start="1649.399" dur="7.75">through Medicaid to the tune of about a</text>
  <text start="1652.98" dur="6.09">half a billion dollars that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1657.149" dur="6.421">significantly more than 60 million</text>
  <text start="1659.07" dur="7.439">dollars in addition to that they already</text>
  <text start="1663.57" dur="7.53">have a significant portion of funds</text>
  <text start="1666.509" dur="5.79">coming from private donors so really</text>
  <text start="1671.1" dur="6.329">they&amp;#39;re just trying to play the victim</text>
  <text start="1672.299" dur="7.951">card in order to make President Trump</text>
  <text start="1677.429" dur="5.541">look bad while at the same time boosting</text>
  <text start="1680.25" dur="6.38">support for them and</text>
  <text start="1682.97" dur="5.699">claiming of course that because they</text>
  <text start="1686.63" dur="4.919">don&amp;#39;t get title ten funding this affects</text>
  <text start="1688.669" dur="5.481">their other services including pap</text>
  <text start="1691.549" dur="5.25">smears and screenings and all of that</text>
  <text start="1694.15" dur="4.659">but there was a solution to that all</text>
  <text start="1696.799" dur="5.221">they would have had to do was separate</text>
  <text start="1698.809" dur="5.911">their abortion services from their other</text>
  <text start="1702.02" dur="4.8">services they could have put abortions</text>
  <text start="1704.72" dur="6.06">in a different building if they wanted</text>
  <text start="1706.82" dur="6.239">to do them so bad and then if they did</text>
  <text start="1710.78" dur="5.04">that then the title 10 funding could</text>
  <text start="1713.059" dur="9.831">have went to the other services the</text>
  <text start="1715.82" dur="7.07">screenings the checkups contraception</text>
  <text start="1724.39" dur="6.7">but their real purpose isn&amp;#39;t that their</text>
  <text start="1728.27" dur="4.56">real purpose is abortions and of course</text>
  <text start="1731.09" dur="6.3">that is where they make a lot of their</text>
  <text start="1732.83" dur="6.36">money anyway which was exposed through</text>
  <text start="1737.39" dur="4.23">those videos that were published by</text>
  <text start="1739.19" dur="11.94">those reporters who are now facing 15</text>
  <text start="1741.62" dur="11.91">felonies but they want people to think</text>
  <text start="1751.13" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re the heroes and that President</text>
  <text start="1753.53" dur="9.779">Trump and anyone who opposes them they</text>
  <text start="1756.02" dur="14.399">are the enemy Planned Parenthood means</text>
  <text start="1763.309" dur="8.73">to be completely dissolved they are one</text>
  <text start="1770.419" dur="4.051">of the organizations that I talk about</text>
  <text start="1772.039" dur="5.01">all the time they are a wolf in sheep&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1774.47" dur="4.589">clothing hiding behind the coat of</text>
  <text start="1777.049" dur="3.841">benevolence oh we&amp;#39;re here to protect</text>
  <text start="1779.059" dur="8.221">women&amp;#39;s reproductive health and no</text>
  <text start="1780.89" dur="8.58">you&amp;#39;re not no you&amp;#39;re not okay enough of</text>
  <text start="1787.28" dur="4.17">that so finally I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="1789.47" dur="4.439">this really briefly this was really odd</text>
  <text start="1791.45" dur="5.99">so today I&amp;#39;m looking around on my</text>
  <text start="1793.909" dur="7.321">Twitter and I come across this post on</text>
  <text start="1797.44" dur="6.34">my Twitter feed I&amp;#39;m still a little bit</text>
  <text start="1801.23" dur="5.52">confused as to why it was there so I</text>
  <text start="1803.78" dur="6.6">don&amp;#39;t follow this person I don&amp;#39;t follow</text>
  <text start="1806.75" dur="7.44">any pages similar to this this was</text>
  <text start="1810.38" dur="5.29">really out of place but I was curious</text>
  <text start="1814.19" dur="3.91">because</text>
  <text start="1815.67" dur="4.65">just seemed off something seemed off</text>
  <text start="1818.1" dur="5.1">about this post so I wanted to look into</text>
  <text start="1820.32" dur="4.5">it a little bit more so when I looked</text>
  <text start="1823.2" dur="4.02">into this of course on this post she</text>
  <text start="1824.82" dur="5.76">says that she&amp;#39;s a stripper in love with</text>
  <text start="1827.22" dur="5.91">the pole whatever kinda looks like a</text>
  <text start="1830.58" dur="5.01">stripper so not surprising however when</text>
  <text start="1833.13" dur="4.95">you go to her page</text>
  <text start="1835.59" dur="6.87">she&amp;#39;s not just a stripper she&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="1838.08" dur="8.66">a prostitute who works at the chicken</text>
  <text start="1842.46" dur="9.15">ranch now the chicken ranch is a brothel</text>
  <text start="1846.74" dur="8.68">legal brothel that is based in Las Vegas</text>
  <text start="1851.61" dur="7.2">Nevada and that brothel used to be owned</text>
  <text start="1855.42" dur="5.94">by a guy by the name of Dennis HOF now I</text>
  <text start="1858.81" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t know who owns it now I tried to</text>
  <text start="1861.36" dur="3.87">dig around to find out who is</text>
  <text start="1862.95" dur="4.41">controlling this ranch at this point and</text>
  <text start="1865.23" dur="6.15">I can&amp;#39;t find it because Dennis HOF</text>
  <text start="1867.36" dur="9.78">actually died in 2018 last year late</text>
  <text start="1871.38" dur="8.66">last year by cardiac arrest I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1877.14" dur="6.39">surprised it wasn&amp;#39;t by hanging because</text>
  <text start="1880.04" dur="6.04">Dennis HOF who owned this chicken ranch</text>
  <text start="1883.53" dur="8.61">was also associated with Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="1886.08" dur="7.83">so back in 2016 her campaign was being</text>
  <text start="1892.14" dur="4.68">pumped full of money from a group called</text>
  <text start="1893.91" dur="8.22">hookers for Hillary hookers for Hillary</text>
  <text start="1896.82" dur="8.58">was based out of this brothel and not</text>
  <text start="1902.13" dur="6.06">only would they give funds to the</text>
  <text start="1905.4" dur="7.34">Hillary Clinton campaign but also they</text>
  <text start="1908.19" dur="7.05">would entice their customers to also</text>
  <text start="1912.74" dur="8.92">give money to the Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="1915.24" dur="8.1">campaign sort of a honey trap so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1921.66" dur="3.72">going to be digging into this a little</text>
  <text start="1923.34" dur="5.13">bit more to make the connection between</text>
  <text start="1925.38" dur="5.64">them and Clinton and possibly even the</text>
  <text start="1928.47" dur="4.29">whole epstein network as well I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="1931.02" dur="3.99">that it&amp;#39;s there so because also</text>
  <text start="1932.76" dur="9.24">interestingly when you look through her</text>
  <text start="1935.01" dur="9.27">feed she mentions being a maxim model</text>
  <text start="1942" dur="4.94">and then there are other females who are</text>
  <text start="1944.28" dur="4.25">on her page who are trying to pose for</text>
  <text start="1946.94" dur="4.11">different</text>
  <text start="1948.53" dur="7.14">modeling agencies or they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1951.05" dur="8.94">model or whatever so it&amp;#39;s all very</text>
  <text start="1955.67" dur="8.78">similar to what we&amp;#39;ve heard about what</text>
  <text start="1959.99" dur="6.36">was going on within the Epstein scandal</text>
  <text start="1964.45" dur="3.61">so I&amp;#39;m going to be digging around a</text>
  <text start="1966.35" dur="4.11">little bit more to find any kind of</text>
  <text start="1968.06" dur="5.1">connection I can but it was just odd</text>
  <text start="1970.46" dur="4.83">that that showed up on my feet so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1973.16" dur="6.42">surprised it&amp;#39;s not a Promoted Tweet oh</text>
  <text start="1975.29" dur="7.86">and one more thing ok so an idea was run</text>
  <text start="1979.58" dur="5.37">across me and so I&amp;#39;m going to present</text>
  <text start="1983.15" dur="7.46">here now and I think it&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="1984.95" dur="9.84">really good idea so it was proposed that</text>
  <text start="1990.61" dur="8.41">the minimum age for sex work should be</text>
  <text start="1994.79" dur="6.57">increased to 21 because that is the</text>
  <text start="1999.02" dur="4.5">general standard right now for being</text>
  <text start="2001.36" dur="5.19">considered or classified as an adult in</text>
  <text start="2003.52" dur="5.58">many places so for example a lot of the</text>
  <text start="2006.55" dur="5.07">states have now increased the age for</text>
  <text start="2009.1" dur="5.78">purchasing a gun to 21 because they say</text>
  <text start="2011.62" dur="6.69">that that is when you are an adult now</text>
  <text start="2014.88" dur="5.23">the same argument could be used for</text>
  <text start="2018.31" dur="4.38">increasing the age of sex work for</text>
  <text start="2020.11" dur="5.4">example at these strip clubs especially</text>
  <text start="2022.69" dur="4.5">the ones that are full nude anyone who</text>
  <text start="2025.51" dur="5.27">is working in the pornographic industry</text>
  <text start="2027.19" dur="7.47">whether it&amp;#39;s making movies or images</text>
  <text start="2030.78" dur="6.55">modeling that involves nudity then the</text>
  <text start="2034.66" dur="6.12">minimum age for that should be 21 so you</text>
  <text start="2037.33" dur="5.67">don&amp;#39;t have 18 year olds 19 year olds 20</text>
  <text start="2040.78" dur="4.77">year old kids working in the sex</text>
  <text start="2043" dur="4.74">industry so then they would be they</text>
  <text start="2045.55" dur="7.2">would be considered a minor in that</text>
  <text start="2047.74" dur="8.52">sense now I had thought about how if we</text>
  <text start="2052.75" dur="5.49">did that then across the board being</text>
  <text start="2056.26" dur="4.53">considered an adult you would have to be</text>
  <text start="2058.24" dur="4.47">21 years old and this might affect gun</text>
  <text start="2060.79" dur="4.98">ownership especially since we&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="2062.71" dur="5">to reduce the age back to 18 in those</text>
  <text start="2065.77" dur="8.04">places where they&amp;#39;ve increased the age</text>
  <text start="2067.71" dur="8.83">but here&amp;#39;s the thing in order to enlist</text>
  <text start="2073.81" dur="4.859">in the service you&amp;#39;re 18 years of age</text>
  <text start="2076.54" dur="4.779">and of course you have to have a weapon</text>
  <text start="2078.669" dur="6.58">when you&amp;#39;re a soldier</text>
  <text start="2081.319" dur="6.9">so then the Second Amendment naturally</text>
  <text start="2085.249" dur="6.45">you would be able to have that right at</text>
  <text start="2088.219" dur="5.971">18 years so that would not be affected</text>
  <text start="2091.699" dur="3.57">as part of this so I think this is a</text>
  <text start="2094.19" dur="3.569">good idea</text>
  <text start="2095.269" dur="5.52">I think this would prevent a lot of</text>
  <text start="2097.759" dur="5.25">these younger women especially teenagers</text>
  <text start="2100.789" dur="5.91">18 19 year olds from being taken</text>
  <text start="2103.009" dur="5.131">advantage of in that industry so tell me</text>
