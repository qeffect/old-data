  <text start="0.24" dur="5.22">welcome back my friends Dustin demos of</text>
  <text start="3.03" dur="4.32">destiny most calm this is not a</text>
  <text start="5.46" dur="6.059">political or cue video necessarily this</text>
  <text start="7.35" dur="6.419">is a community video alright cue</text>
  <text start="11.519" dur="4.711">community though and this is I think</text>
  <text start="13.769" dur="5.071">important because as I&amp;#39;m preparing for</text>
  <text start="16.23" dur="4.68">my debate would lead tomorrow I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="18.84" dur="4.65">noticing that some people are pretty</text>
  <text start="20.91" dur="4.47">rude right and and and these are you</text>
  <text start="23.49" dur="3.539">know everyone really but Q supporters</text>
  <text start="25.38" dur="3.93">have some rude people among our ranks as</text>
  <text start="27.029" dur="4.231">well right it takes all kind of kinds</text>
  <text start="29.31" dur="3.9">there are people who are definitely</text>
  <text start="31.26" dur="6.47">gung-ho and passionate about justice and</text>
  <text start="33.21" dur="7.169">sometimes I think they see anyone who is</text>
  <text start="37.73" dur="4.06">skeptical of Q at this point because</text>
  <text start="40.379" dur="3.991">we&amp;#39;ve seen so much evidence and we</text>
  <text start="41.79" dur="4.14">basically are you know we&amp;#39;ve seen it we</text>
  <text start="44.37" dur="4.709">know it we don&amp;#39;t have to believe it we</text>
  <text start="45.93" dur="9.109">know it you know at least as a</text>
  <text start="49.079" dur="8.25">probability issue the people who are</text>
  <text start="55.039" dur="4.121">skeptical are not necessarily evil</text>
  <text start="57.329" dur="3.601">people right they&amp;#39;re not necessarily</text>
  <text start="59.16" dur="4.68">part of the P EE trying to block</text>
  <text start="60.93" dur="4.86">progress into everything that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="63.84" dur="3.45">some of them are just skeptical people</text>
  <text start="65.79" dur="4.22">and this is a very difficult to believe</text>
  <text start="67.29" dur="4.86">and I want to go through a couple of the</text>
  <text start="70.01" dur="5.8">things that are going on out there</text>
  <text start="72.15" dur="5.64">first I want to talk about be polite be</text>
  <text start="75.81" dur="6.03">polite and in what you&amp;#39;re doing be</text>
  <text start="77.79" dur="5.28">logical be polite look up ways to to</text>
  <text start="81.84" dur="2.73">engage with people there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="3.119">guides out there a lot of books about</text>
  <text start="84.57" dur="6.659">people skills and things that you can</text>
  <text start="86.189" dur="7.201">brush up really quickly and and beyond</text>
  <text start="91.229" dur="3.75">just being polite because you win more</text>
  <text start="93.39" dur="5.04">hunt you win more flies with honey than</text>
  <text start="94.979" dur="5.611">vinegar right beyond that you know I</text>
  <text start="98.43" dur="3.39">always request my viewers to be polite</text>
  <text start="100.59" dur="3.48">but there&amp;#39;s always people out there</text>
  <text start="101.82" dur="4.17">attacking attacking attacking and this</text>
  <text start="104.07" dur="4.439">brings up another point there are people</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="5.129">in our movement like I the spy who</text>
  <text start="108.509" dur="4.621">become very popular say a bunch of</text>
  <text start="111.119" dur="3.271">things that sound good change their name</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="4.44">when they get busted and do it all over</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="8.07">again there are people out there who get</text>
  <text start="117.57" dur="7.049">into the movement some of the cue tubers</text>
  <text start="122.46" dur="3.479">possibly Roseanne as well right like</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="3.271">look what happened with Valerie Jarrett</text>
  <text start="125.939" dur="3.841">and Roseanne Valerie Jarrett was exposed</text>
  <text start="127.89" dur="4.76">then Rosanna comes out and calls her</text>
  <text start="129.78" dur="5.09">like a 1/8 monkey</text>
  <text start="132.65" dur="4.229">like Planet of the Apes reference right</text>
  <text start="134.87" dur="4.02">and then everybody&amp;#39;s like ol Roseanne&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.879" dur="4.08">racist and Valerie&amp;#39;s just look like she</text>
  <text start="138.89" dur="3">looks like a monkey and she does not</text>
  <text start="140.959" dur="2.731">look black</text>
  <text start="141.89" dur="3.179">I don&amp;#39;t yeah I think Rosa ain&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="143.69" dur="4.23">said this I don&amp;#39;t know if Roseanne was</text>
  <text start="145.069" dur="7.17">guilty that was a facial characteristic</text>
  <text start="147.92" dur="6.179">thing not a race thing similar but</text>
  <text start="152.239" dur="4.411">dissimilar to the whole Michelle Obama</text>
  <text start="154.099" dur="6.78">ape face mean if you ever saw that that</text>
  <text start="156.65" dur="7.32">was potentially racist this one I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="160.879" dur="4.2">think was race motivated however there</text>
  <text start="163.97" dur="4.17">are people who will get into our</text>
  <text start="165.079" dur="5.97">movement become you know influencers or</text>
  <text start="168.14" dur="5.429">positions of authority or respect or</text>
  <text start="171.049" dur="7.47">whatever and then screw up or spread</text>
  <text start="173.569" dur="7.771">lies or be rude or just mess us up</text>
  <text start="178.519" dur="5.101">somehow right and some of these are paid</text>
  <text start="181.34" dur="4.319">shills obviously very obviously these</text>
  <text start="183.62" dur="4.92">are the ones that will show up repeat</text>
  <text start="185.659" dur="4.621">the same debunking and then when you</text>
  <text start="188.54" dur="4.5">show them how they&amp;#39;re wrong and you</text>
  <text start="190.28" dur="4.049">piece it together for them politely five</text>
  <text start="193.04" dur="3.059">minutes later they&amp;#39;re on another post</text>
  <text start="194.329" dur="5.671">right they&amp;#39;re spreading the same copy</text>
  <text start="196.099" dur="5.461">paste it lies there are people whose</text>
  <text start="200" dur="3.12">egos are tied into it there are people</text>
  <text start="201.56" dur="2.64">who who don&amp;#39;t want to necessarily admit</text>
  <text start="203.12" dur="5.759">that they were wrong that a lot of these</text>
  <text start="204.2" dur="6.06">people are are bad actors I mean we know</text>
  <text start="208.879" dur="3.241">that they&amp;#39;ve been paying people for</text>
  <text start="210.26" dur="4.92">years to do things like this there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="212.12" dur="7.11">whole data centers full of bad guys who</text>
  <text start="215.18" dur="6.51">basically just trolling us and that is</text>
  <text start="219.23" dur="4.77">part of this so just like when you have</text>

  <text start="237.139" dur="5.371">want people who are rude and spreading</text>
  <text start="240.47" dur="3.72">deception to come into the Q community</text>

  <text start="257.84" dur="3.389">opinion</text>
  <text start="258.32" dur="4.26">to simply trust the plan and follow Q</text>

  <text start="409.78" dur="3.2">against rudeness I want to ask my</text>
  <text start="411.25" dur="3.93">viewers to push back against rudeness</text>
  <text start="412.98" dur="4.09">you don&amp;#39;t have to get into fights or</text>
  <text start="415.18" dur="3.45">anything just let people know if you see</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="5.19">someone out there spreading deceptions</text>
  <text start="418.63" dur="5.82">or or or or maybe they&amp;#39;re doing a bad</text>
  <text start="422.26" dur="4.2">job maybe on purpose of trying to spread</text>
  <text start="424.45" dur="4.23">the Q stuff right like I&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="426.46" dur="3.72">ones out there doing the what we love q</text>

  <text start="430.18" dur="4.65">do something that&amp;#39;s not a real proof</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="4.55">okay and I&amp;#39;ll see I&amp;#39;ve seen people out</text>
  <text start="434.83" dur="4.59">there like Isaac what they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="436.26" dur="5.29">attack a fake proof like this this POTUS</text>
  <text start="439.42" dur="3.54">schedule this POTUS schedule is not</text>
  <text start="441.55" dur="3">necessarily a legitimate government</text>
  <text start="442.96" dur="4.11">account guys we cannot use POTUS</text>
  <text start="444.55" dur="4.14">schedule as proofs for Q so when when</text>
  <text start="447.07" dur="4.2">POTUS schedule post something that Q</text>
  <text start="448.69" dur="5.28">just posted and then Isaac uses that as</text>
  <text start="451.27" dur="4.44">a proof that he can then debunk because</text>
  <text start="453.97" dur="3.39">POTUS schedule is fake for all I know</text>
  <text start="455.71" dur="4.11">Isaac is POTUS schedule right there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="457.36" dur="5.1">there&amp;#39;s no proof behind us no evidence</text>
  <text start="459.82" dur="6.63">so there are fake Q proof circling folks</text>

  <text start="550.35" dur="4.02">four thousand five thousand whatever</text>
  <text start="552.089" dur="3.69">people watching this is a useful debate</text>
  <text start="554.37" dur="2.909">especially if there&amp;#39;s only one or two</text>
  <text start="555.779" dur="3.991">and you want to get practiced at your</text>
  <text start="557.279" dur="5.541">debate skills right all you need to know</text>
  <text start="559.77" dur="8.61">are a couple of the following things</text>
  <text start="562.82" dur="7.209">excuse me one logical fallacies all</text>
  <text start="568.38" dur="3.149">right this is important and once you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="570.029" dur="3.091">learned this neat little trick you&amp;#39;ll</text>

  <text start="573.12" dur="4.469">will work on you anymore each logical</text>
  <text start="575.22" dur="3.51">fallacies kind of its own trick but the</text>
  <text start="577.589" dur="5.761">main ones that you&amp;#39;re gonna come across</text>
  <text start="578.73" dur="6.48">almost always are appeals to ridicule</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="4.38">all right you believe in queueing on</text>
  <text start="585.21" dur="4.98">your stupid who could ever believe in</text>
  <text start="587.73" dur="5.85">that right you haven&amp;#39;t said anything to</text>
  <text start="590.19" dur="6.69">convince me otherwise ad hominem which</text>
  <text start="593.58" dur="6.21">is Latin for against the nail well you</text>
  <text start="596.88" dur="5.85">believe in cueing on but you did this so</text>
  <text start="599.79" dur="5.94">why should we listen to you well I could</text>
  <text start="602.73" dur="5.52">be like putting puppies in a grinder and</text>
  <text start="605.73" dur="4.47">tell you the Sun is out and even though</text>

  <text start="610.2" dur="4.8">in a meat grinder the Sun is still out</text>
  <text start="612.18" dur="5.43">so even though an evil person might say</text>
  <text start="615" dur="3.66">something true you cannot disprove them</text>
  <text start="617.61" dur="3.12">by pointing out that they&amp;#39;re an evil</text>
  <text start="618.66" dur="3.24">person not that I&amp;#39;m an evil person or</text>

  <text start="621.9" dur="6.45">my god I&amp;#39;d kill someone for that but the</text>
  <text start="625.38" dur="4.68">point is is that these work these work</text>
