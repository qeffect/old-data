  <text start="1.52" dur="5.5">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="3.959" dur="6.6">Mouse of Destiny most calm and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="7.02" dur="6.06">run through a quite a few things just to</text>
  <text start="10.559" dur="4.591">get caught back up to basically just</text>
  <text start="13.08" dur="5.43">this morning it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="15.15" dur="5.28">everything from the 22nd and a couple of</text>
  <text start="18.51" dur="5.16">things from this morning and then we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="20.43" dur="7.55">see if anything big happens later in the</text>
  <text start="23.67" dur="8.04">evening so Civil War kind of a</text>
  <text start="27.98" dur="5.41">hyperbolic kind of not the the yellow</text>
  <text start="31.71" dur="3.3">vest movement is really ramping up</text>
  <text start="33.39" dur="4.53">everywhere worldwide it seems especially</text>
  <text start="35.01" dur="6.15">across Europe it&amp;#39;s moved at least to the</text>
  <text start="37.92" dur="6.869">UK to to Canada possibly in the US as</text>
  <text start="41.16" dur="7.55">well so it&amp;#39;s interesting it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="44.789" dur="5.43">freedom anti-globalist kind of loose</text>
  <text start="48.71" dur="4.21">conglomeration of many different</text>
  <text start="50.219" dur="7.261">interests I think it&amp;#39;s hard to quite peg</text>
  <text start="52.92" dur="6.18">it but I think that this is a good sign</text>
  <text start="57.48" dur="3.09">I think that this is a good trend we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="59.1" dur="3.86">seen them we&amp;#39;ve seen them back down</text>
  <text start="60.57" dur="5.369">micron in France I mean he just he just</text>
  <text start="62.96" dur="4.75">wilted on their demands in many ways so</text>
  <text start="65.939" dur="3.601">that is interesting we have seen</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="4.589">violence this is the kind of thing that</text>
  <text start="69.54" dur="6.509">could ramp up and and and turn into a</text>
  <text start="72.299" dur="5.401">revolution overnight I think if the</text>
  <text start="76.049" dur="4.081">government were to land go kill someone</text>
  <text start="77.7" dur="5.459">or make a mistake that was really public</text>
  <text start="80.13" dur="4.59">but um you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost as</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="3">though we&amp;#39;re living in that movie V for</text>
  <text start="84.72" dur="5.759">Vendetta I don&amp;#39;t know if you guys have</text>
  <text start="86.159" dur="6.241">seen that it&amp;#39;s a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="3.421">superhero movie but there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="92.4" dur="3.539">truth in it and I don&amp;#39;t think that we</text>
  <text start="93.9" dur="3.509">should sort of rely on the superhero you</text>
  <text start="95.939" dur="3.901">could almost think of Ephraim and data</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="3.631">like V is almost cute it&amp;#39;s almost I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="99.84" dur="4.44">never actually made that connection</text>
  <text start="101.04" dur="4.649">before but that&amp;#39;s almost eerie in in the</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="3.36">way that they are actually working</text>
  <text start="105.689" dur="5.82">except for V is more of like a superhero</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="5.759">with knives but yeah very good movie</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="3.15">well worth of watch but it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="113.399" dur="2.641">we&amp;#39;re living in that movie I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="4.201">to spoil it but at the very end there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.04" dur="4.859">a large crowd and he&amp;#39;s sort of rioting</text>
  <text start="118.86" dur="6.18">this kind of thing so for those who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="120.899" dur="5.76">seen it you may catch the reference now</text>
  <text start="125.04" dur="6.99">I know Peter Schiff gets a lot of flack</text>
  <text start="126.659" dur="7.111">from both the crypto crowd for his you</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="4.74">know very much being against script</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="5.97">was very much a gold guy but I&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="136.77" dur="5.7">kind of respected him primarily from the</text>
  <text start="139.74" dur="4.59">crypto crowd only he mainstream</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="4.08">obviously kind of think he&amp;#39;s quacky but</text>
  <text start="144.33" dur="4.29">you know he&amp;#39;s allowed on the TV station</text>
  <text start="146.55" dur="5.22">sometimes he&amp;#39;s good for television I</text>
  <text start="148.62" dur="5.91">guess you know his dad died is at prison</text>
  <text start="151.77" dur="5.34">a prisoner of the US government as a tax</text>
  <text start="154.53" dur="6.66">protester basically for writing a book</text>
  <text start="157.11" dur="5.97">or one chef a tragic story especially</text>
  <text start="161.19" dur="3.99">the way you know he went out at the end</text>
  <text start="163.08" dur="3.3">and all of that so I feel like Peter</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="2.61">Schiff is one of those guys that you can</text>
  <text start="166.38" dur="3.3">really trust when it comes to talking</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="5.07">about the Fed or the economy or any of</text>
  <text start="169.68" dur="4.71">that stuff but he does have gold colored</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="2.94">lenses when you when he sees the world</text>
  <text start="174.39" dur="4.89">and that&amp;#39;s important to understand but</text>
  <text start="175.8" dur="6.39">he he did predict o8 the crash of await</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="4.62">and he&amp;#39;s you know basically this is that</text>
  <text start="182.19" dur="3.86">this is the same thing it&amp;#39;s not a new</text>
  <text start="183.9" dur="4.11">crash it&amp;#39;s the same thing they just</text>
  <text start="186.05" dur="3.49">things have quit working now that</text>
  <text start="188.01" dur="2.82">they&amp;#39;ve turned off the the money</text>
  <text start="189.54" dur="3.57">printing and it started to raise</text>
  <text start="190.83" dur="5.43">interest rates it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just an easy to</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="4.95">determine predictable outcome anyway</text>
  <text start="196.26" dur="4.08">he&amp;#39;s now saying this is not going to be</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="3.84">your garden-variety recession and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="200.34" dur="2.75">been talking about this what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="201.9" dur="3.63">and others have been talking about this</text>
  <text start="203.09" dur="6.52">it just seems like it&amp;#39;s heading more for</text>
  <text start="205.53" dur="7.29">a full collapse of the system not</text>
  <text start="209.61" dur="5.64">necessarily just a reset not resetting</text>
  <text start="212.82" dur="4.98">the depression or something like that or</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="5.49">recession so it&amp;#39;s important to keep that</text>
  <text start="217.8" dur="6.03">in mind as well this was well worth</text>
  <text start="220.74" dur="4.8">mentioning nearly 90 percent of privacy</text>
  <text start="223.83" dur="5.7">curtains in the hospital rooms are</text>
  <text start="225.54" dur="6.6">loaded with a mersa those superbugs so</text>
  <text start="229.53" dur="3.93">you know obviously if you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="232.14" dur="3.54">following my channel you know I try to</text>
  <text start="233.46" dur="4.68">avoid doctors as much as possible on</text>
  <text start="235.68" dur="6.45">clean places people who were taught to</text>
  <text start="238.14" dur="6.42">give me surgery or radiation or poisoned</text>
  <text start="242.13" dur="3.84">for treatments rather than actually try</text>
  <text start="244.56" dur="3.09">to address the issues have no</text>
  <text start="245.97" dur="3.66">understanding of the underlying issues</text>
  <text start="247.65" dur="4.62">in many cases I just don&amp;#39;t trust the</text>
  <text start="249.63" dur="4.47">system I really don&amp;#39;t I have done very</text>
  <text start="252.27" dur="5.12">well treating myself at home</text>
  <text start="254.1" dur="5.82">holistically with with herbs plants</text>
  <text start="257.39" dur="5.26">different things that I concoct myself</text>
  <text start="259.92" dur="3.719">different types of DIY supplements you</text>
  <text start="262.65" dur="5.19">know often in the form</text>
  <text start="263.639" dur="7.77">powders or liquids or whatever very</text>
  <text start="267.84" dur="5.25">cheap easy to do stuff just a little bit</text>
  <text start="271.409" dur="3.78">of learning required which was easy part</text>
  <text start="273.09" dur="4.02">because I actually enjoy this stuff and</text>
  <text start="275.189" dur="4.051">I&amp;#39;ve really never need to go see a</text>
  <text start="277.11" dur="3.63">doctor at all and it&amp;#39;s worked out pretty</text>
  <text start="279.24" dur="3.329">well for me so far I know I&amp;#39;m young and</text>
  <text start="280.74" dur="6.179">old but I am trying to be proactive</text>
  <text start="282.569" dur="6.421">about it well I actually didn&amp;#39;t mean to</text>
  <text start="286.919" dur="4.11">put this page in there but I did reach</text>
  <text start="288.99" dur="3.57">out to defense distributed for those who</text>
  <text start="291.029" dur="4.38">are interested in seeing if there&amp;#39;s any</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="6.599">kind of new updates around the 3d</text>
  <text start="295.409" dur="9.06">printing gun technology or the just the</text>
  <text start="299.159" dur="6.72">the sort of fake news attack they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="304.469" dur="3.271">trying to basically railroad the guy</text>
  <text start="305.879" dur="4.081">behind it Cody Wilson with with</text>
  <text start="307.74" dur="4.88">fraudulent pedophilia charges or</text>
  <text start="309.96" dur="4.949">something like trying to set him up for</text>
  <text start="312.62" dur="3.609">having been hitting on some underage</text>
  <text start="314.909" dur="3.06">girl on a dating site something like</text>
  <text start="316.229" dur="3.87">that in Taiwan or something</text>
  <text start="317.969" dur="3.78">basically they couldn&amp;#39;t shot stopped him</text>
  <text start="320.099" dur="3.421">through the courts he kept outsmarting</text>
  <text start="321.749" dur="5.431">them he kept getting the information out</text>
  <text start="323.52" dur="6.419">there on how to get this kind of</text>
  <text start="327.18" dur="4.59">technology how to to spread it around</text>
  <text start="329.939" dur="4.29">the world he was giving it for free to</text>
  <text start="331.77" dur="4.319">people or or for small amounts of money</text>
  <text start="334.229" dur="4.171">to kind of run costs and stuff and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.089" dur="4.621">got an actual device that runs you can</text>
  <text start="338.4" dur="5.28">buy it called the ghost gunner that will</text>
  <text start="340.71" dur="4.949">take a eighty percent unfinished lower</text>
  <text start="343.68" dur="4.68">for building your own gun which you can</text>
  <text start="345.659" dur="3.87">do at home yourself if you know how but</text>
  <text start="348.36" dur="3.299">this takes the skill out you can</text>
  <text start="349.529" dur="6.06">actually buy the machine very relatively</text>
  <text start="351.659" dur="5.73">inexpensively like two grand let it run</text>
  <text start="355.589" dur="3.45">one of the guns that it knows how to do</text>
  <text start="357.389" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s only so many but they&amp;#39;re adding all</text>
  <text start="359.039" dur="5.19">the time and it will actually do the</text>
  <text start="362.339" dur="4.32">precision metal cutting work with no</text>
  <text start="364.229" dur="4.771">skill required for that particular gun</text>
  <text start="366.659" dur="5.341">so it&amp;#39;s really a neat thing you</text>
  <text start="369" dur="5.399">basically it opens up the ability to DIY</text>
  <text start="372" dur="4.11">guns for idiots even if they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="374.399" dur="4.98">any tools or skills other than this</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="5.75">machine and it allows you to also open</text>
  <text start="379.379" dur="5.07">up the interesting option of having a</text>
  <text start="381.86" dur="4.72">gun with no serial number that is legal</text>
  <text start="384.449" dur="4.65">because you made it yourself I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="386.58" dur="4.139">know how that goes with transferring</text>
  <text start="389.099" dur="3.391">them even as a gift I don&amp;#39;t know if that</text>
  <text start="390.719" dur="3.721">works I know you can&amp;#39;t sell them</text>
  <text start="392.49" dur="4.049">obviously but it&amp;#39;s a fascinating</text>
  <text start="394.44" dur="2.52">technology and it really does lock in</text>
  <text start="396.539" dur="1.621">the</text>
  <text start="396.96" dur="3.41">an amendment because what are they gonna</text>
  <text start="398.16" dur="5.069">do now we can print these things at home</text>
  <text start="400.37" dur="5.29">or relatively soon we&amp;#39;ll be able to just</text>
  <text start="403.229" dur="4.291">kind of like the joke just turn on the</text>
  <text start="405.66" dur="4.86">printer and out pops a full ar-15 or</text>
  <text start="407.52" dur="6">something German government to</text>
  <text start="410.52" dur="5.82">re-educate kids of right-wing parents</text>
  <text start="413.52" dur="6.66">now the culture over there in Germany is</text>
  <text start="416.34" dur="6.06">pretty darn bad there are definitely</text>
  <text start="420.18" dur="5.37">some no-go zones where you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="422.4" dur="5.91">go I think child marriage even multiple</text>
  <text start="425.55" dur="5.459">brides so polygamous child brides are</text>
  <text start="428.31" dur="7.62">now protected therefore for Sharia</text>
  <text start="431.009" dur="6.271">followers it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a wild situation</text>
  <text start="435.93" dur="3.329">to see and I actually have I think I</text>
  <text start="437.28" dur="3.78">have some German in my heritage and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="439.259" dur="3.961">I&amp;#39;m actually kind of sad to see this</text>
  <text start="441.06" dur="3.449">happened because I&amp;#39;ve always kind of</text>
  <text start="443.22" dur="3.93">thought Germans are supposed to be like</text>
  <text start="444.509" dur="7.851">smart people and and I&amp;#39;m sort of let</text>
  <text start="447.15" dur="7.59">down lately let&amp;#39;s see we have McConnell</text>
  <text start="452.36" dur="3.67">rejecting the nuclear option you guys</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="4.019">have probably already heard about this</text>
  <text start="456.03" dur="4.35">but he says there&amp;#39;s too many senators on</text>
  <text start="458.759" dur="3.121">vacation he&amp;#39;s gonna do the right thing</text>
  <text start="460.38" dur="3.779">and he&amp;#39;s gonna reject the nuclear option</text>
  <text start="461.88" dur="4.759">to get the vote passed and and and then</text>
  <text start="464.159" dur="6.271">of course now we&amp;#39;re going into the the</text>
  <text start="466.639" dur="5.291">holidays with with no sort of resolution</text>
  <text start="470.43" dur="3.209">of course Trump is kind of pulling over</text>
  <text start="471.93" dur="3.6">time and he&amp;#39;s gonna get back right back</text>
  <text start="473.639" dur="4.111">on it he&amp;#39;s delaying his own plans to do</text>
  <text start="475.53" dur="4.979">this did you still try to fight for us</text>
  <text start="477.75" dur="8.31">but and of course remember he does not</text>
  <text start="480.509" dur="7.201">take a salary but the there&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.06" dur="5.37">dealing with the same people who snuck</text>
  <text start="487.71" dur="6.299">in the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 when</text>
  <text start="491.43" dur="4.68">everybody was gone home on vacation and</text>
  <text start="494.009" dur="4.53">it was just a few folks there and they</text>
  <text start="496.11" dur="4.94">did it on purpose that way this is the</text>
  <text start="498.539" dur="8.13">kind of things that they do we cannot</text>
  <text start="501.05" dur="7.66">necessarily hold punches right now these</text>
  <text start="506.669" dur="4.201">people want our blood they want us dead</text>
  <text start="508.71" dur="4.59">they want us out of power so that they</text>
  <text start="510.87" dur="4.08">can start reading of right-wing kids</text>
  <text start="513.3" dur="4.02">here I mean that&amp;#39;s basically where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.95" dur="3.99">headed for sure that&amp;#39;s where the signs</text>
  <text start="517.32" dur="3.69">are pointing it&amp;#39;s not like they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="518.94" dur="3.57">stop and decide they&amp;#39;ve taken enough</text>
  <text start="521.01" dur="2.73">cultural land for a generation or</text>
  <text start="522.51" dur="2.88">anything you know and they&amp;#39;re gonna just</text>
  <text start="523.74" dur="4.65">wait for a while they&amp;#39;re there more in a</text>
  <text start="525.39" dur="3.75">frenzy than ever it&amp;#39;s going to escalate</text>
  <text start="528.39" dur="3.48">into some</text>
  <text start="529.14" dur="6.09">and really kills their morale for a</text>
  <text start="531.87" dur="4.68">while or they go to prison or Civil War</text>
  <text start="535.23" dur="3.78">or something because they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="536.55" dur="5.67">going to stop hopefully it will be a</text>
  <text start="539.01" dur="5.52">nonviolent solution so Joe em says</text>
  <text start="542.22" dur="4.56">Christmas is this time of year around</text>
  <text start="544.53" dur="4.41">the winter solstice the ending of a long</text>
  <text start="546.78" dur="3.99">descent into darkness and the start of a</text>
  <text start="548.94" dur="4.26">glorious march into the path of light</text>
  <text start="550.77" dur="6.48">the true meaning of Christmas is from</text>
  <text start="553.2" dur="6.48">dark to light which is some phrase cue</text>
  <text start="557.25" dur="4.08">often repeats yeah and it makes sense if</text>
  <text start="559.68" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re talking about solstices and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="561.33" dur="4.74">talking about you know sort of the the</text>
  <text start="563.82" dur="4.11">greater game going on behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="566.07" dur="5.4">in which these dates often seem to</text>
  <text start="567.93" dur="6.6">matter between the elite maybe both good</text>
