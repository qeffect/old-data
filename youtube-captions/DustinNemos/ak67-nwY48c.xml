  <text start="2924.979" dur="3.75">one is really dangerous to breathe but</text>
  <text start="2926.779" dur="5.04">otherwise it&amp;#39;s amazing like I&amp;#39;ve used it</text>
  <text start="2928.729" dur="4.86">for for like my dogs for example you can</text>
  <text start="2931.819" dur="4.38">eat it it&amp;#39;s good for you in that sense</text>
  <text start="2933.589" dur="4.051">you feed it to your animals and even</text>

  <text start="2947.839" dur="4.321">people are saying things like that</text>
  <text start="2948.979" dur="5.191">lately so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s varieties now</text>
  <text start="2952.16" dur="4.289">in carbon 60 like there&amp;#39;s the red</text>
  <text start="2954.17" dur="4.559">variety that kind of turns olive oil</text>
  <text start="2956.449" dur="4.5">sort of a reddish color or coconut oil</text>
  <text start="2958.729" dur="4.14">purple that&amp;#39;s what we have for a very</text>
  <text start="2960.949" dur="3.84">long time that&amp;#39;s my favorite kind of</text>

  <text start="2964.789" dur="5.601">really cool looking then there&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="2967.4" dur="6.929">the black kind alright now this is like</text>
  <text start="2970.39" dur="5.709">different but also still carbon 16 and I</text>
  <text start="2974.329" dur="3.78">think it&amp;#39;s just a density thing with</text>
  <text start="2976.099" dur="4.26">that there was a video by Bob Greco</text>
  <text start="2978.109" dur="4.86">where he shows the difference with the</text>
