  <text start="132.299" dur="3.72">Meadows claimed the abnormal handling of</text>
  <text start="134.43" dur="3">the probe into alleged coordination</text>
  <text start="136.019" dur="3.3">between Russian officials in the Trump</text>
  <text start="137.43" dur="4.11">presidential campaign was a quote a</text>

  <text start="276.8" dur="3.27">got to get the documents there you got</text>
  <text start="278.6" dur="3.72">to let people have time to digest it you</text>
  <text start="280.07" dur="3.66">have to then build you know press</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="3.6">coverage of it and build the momentum</text>
  <text start="283.73" dur="3.51">around it in spite of all of the crap</text>
  <text start="285.92" dur="2.91">that they&amp;#39;re doing to delay and you have</text>
  <text start="287.24" dur="4.44">to counteract all the Democrat tricks</text>
