  <text start="29.16" dur="5.7">works this time yeah so exciting topic</text>
  <text start="32.51" dur="4.69">that I usually don&amp;#39;t cover that much</text>
  <text start="34.86" dur="4.56">alien secret space program all of that</text>
  <text start="37.2" dur="3.84">stuff this is your area of expertise and</text>
  <text start="39.42" dur="4.409">I I kind of want to let you run with it</text>
  <text start="41.04" dur="4.589">I have a lot of questions but you know I</text>
  <text start="43.829" dur="3.331">don&amp;#39;t know that much about it I want to</text>
  <text start="45.629" dur="3.571">learn more I&amp;#39;ve done enough deep dives</text>
  <text start="47.16" dur="3.21">to know that there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot going</text>
  <text start="49.2" dur="3.179">on that they don&amp;#39;t tell us they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="50.37" dur="5.88">hiding a lot of things Antarctica comes</text>
  <text start="52.379" dur="7.34">to mind Admiral Byrd comes to mind rest</text>
  <text start="56.25" dur="6.719">history comes to mind even in some cases</text>
  <text start="59.719" dur="6.94">you know what do they what&amp;#39;s the word</text>
  <text start="62.969" dur="5.281">for it like hidden fossils the things</text>
  <text start="66.659" dur="3.541">that they&amp;#39;ve kind of all sorts of</text>
  <text start="68.25" dur="5.46">archaeology that&amp;#39;s hidden in ancient</text>
  <text start="70.2" dur="5.43">history and Sciences yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="73.71" dur="5.549">fascinating subject to me because of how</text>
  <text start="75.63" dur="6.059">much there truly is that is hidden from</text>
  <text start="79.259" dur="3.201">us in the realm of Technology ancient</text>
  <text start="81.689" dur="5.131">history</text>
  <text start="82.46" dur="7.24">sciences and physics that occulted</text>
  <text start="86.82" dur="4.95">hidden away so at least for myself I</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="6.51">started researching all of this probably</text>
  <text start="91.77" dur="8.36">I mean I would say 2012-13 even because</text>
  <text start="96.21" dur="6.18">I was getting into the free-energy topic</text>
  <text start="100.13" dur="3.849">researching zero-point energy and the</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="4.049">black budgets and all of the</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="5.85">unacknowledged special access programs</text>
  <text start="106.439" dur="8.96">so that research began in 2012-13 and it</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="8.07">was really in 2015-16 when certain</text>
  <text start="115.399" dur="5.08">insiders and whistleblowers and people</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="4.951">began coming out with even more</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="4.981">expansive information connecting even</text>
  <text start="122.85" dur="5.07">more dots so it went from you know a</text>
  <text start="125.46" dur="5.01">couple of black projects and believing</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="5.67">that free energy is real - oh my gosh</text>
  <text start="130.47" dur="6.57">they have most likely developed</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="5.25">programs within the Navy CIA Air Force</text>
  <text start="137.04" dur="3.6">corporate contractors and there could</text>
  <text start="138.84" dur="3.539">even be a brief way civilization out</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="3.84">there and then all the Antarctica pieces</text>
  <text start="142.379" dur="4.921">began coming together so over the course</text>
  <text start="144.48" dur="4.289">of the past few years it&amp;#39;s trying to put</text>
  <text start="147.3" dur="3.36">this whole puzzle together</text>
  <text start="148.769" dur="3.241">of course like so many people out there</text>
  <text start="150.66" dur="3.21">like you and everybody else on the</text>
  <text start="152.01" dur="4.38">internet is trying to do with their</text>
  <text start="153.87" dur="4.86">citizen journalism just find out what</text>
  <text start="156.39" dur="4.349">the heck is really going on on this</text>
  <text start="158.73" dur="3.6">planet I just took it a step further and</text>
  <text start="160.739" dur="3.571">started looking at the cosmos and not</text>
  <text start="162.33" dur="4.8">just this planet and really trying to</text>
  <text start="164.31" dur="4.44">see it all you know man I have my hands</text>
  <text start="167.13" dur="4.079">full with the Q stuff I can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="4.079">imagine I know man and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.209" dur="3.78">fantastic that that&amp;#39;s going on because</text>
  <text start="172.829" dur="4.801">some people would have noticed is that</text>
  <text start="174.989" dur="4.381">they devote a hundred percent of their</text>
  <text start="177.63" dur="2.999">time to Q and that&amp;#39;s fantastic you know</text>
  <text start="179.37" dur="1.589">it&amp;#39;s great that we have people doing</text>
  <text start="180.629" dur="2.431">that</text>
  <text start="180.959" dur="3.87">so when newbies come in they can get</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="3.45">familiar with the topic and run with</text>
  <text start="184.829" dur="4.02">their work but then there&amp;#39;s other people</text>
  <text start="186.51" dur="3.569">that are maybe touch on Q here and there</text>
  <text start="188.849" dur="2.761">but then they have their other niches</text>
  <text start="190.079" dur="5.071">that they&amp;#39;re bringing to the picture</text>
  <text start="191.61" dur="5.189">because let&amp;#39;s be real Q is very narrow Q</text>
  <text start="195.15" dur="4.739">is very focused right now there&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="196.799" dur="5.461">specific goal that the white hats</text>
  <text start="199.889" dur="3.871">enacted Q width you know there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="202.26" dur="3.059">of stuff they haven&amp;#39;t touched on and</text>
  <text start="203.76" dur="3.509">that all the stuff they haven&amp;#39;t touched</text>
  <text start="205.319" dur="3.57">on it&amp;#39;s just gonna continue rolling out</text>
  <text start="207.269" dur="4.021">into the public domain over the course</text>
  <text start="208.889" dur="4.5">of the next months and years and whatnot</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s really gonna be you and me and a</text>
  <text start="213.389" dur="4.921">lot of other people that are going to be</text>
  <text start="214.95" dur="5.67">getting this information out there there</text>
  <text start="218.31" dur="4.019">are a lot of red pills they have the</text>
  <text start="220.62" dur="4.53">health the suppressed technologies the</text>
  <text start="222.329" dur="4.351">the hid secret space program you know I</text>
  <text start="225.15" dur="3.75">like to focus on a lot of the health</text>
  <text start="226.68" dur="3.63">stuff too but yeah it&amp;#39;s yeah I know I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="228.9" dur="2.82">like a lot of your health work it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.31" dur="3.09">amazing of course all the political</text>
  <text start="231.72" dur="3.599">stuff you know that&amp;#39;s really what Q&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.4" dur="3.86">hitting and so many thousands of</text>
  <text start="235.319" dur="5.28">researchers are hitting with Q and</text>
  <text start="237.26" dur="4.93">exposing those dark occult groups you</text>
  <text start="240.599" dur="4.021">know and and the beautiful thing about</text>
  <text start="242.19" dur="4.979">it is that it&amp;#39;s all connected in one way</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="4.589">or another so I know you and I we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="247.169" dur="5.4">going to we&amp;#39;ve been invited to a</text>
  <text start="249.209" dur="5.731">conference next year that has to do with</text>
  <text start="252.569" dur="3.78">natural health and vaccines which is</text>
  <text start="254.94" dur="4.56">great because they&amp;#39;re bringing both of</text>
  <text start="256.349" dur="5.491">us out there to expand the thinking a</text>
  <text start="259.5" dur="4.68">little bit get some more topics into it</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="5.62">you know there&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s great to see</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="6.28">people from all walks of life begin to</text>
  <text start="267.46" dur="5.91">see how everything connects and there is</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="5.13">truly a bigger picture there is there is</text>
  <text start="273.37" dur="4.199">everything is connected and I try to</text>
  <text start="275.59" dur="3.449">touch on many different topics but this</text>
  <text start="277.569" dur="4.201">is the topic that I want to get into</text>
  <text start="279.039" dur="6.151">today with you I want to ask do it the</text>
  <text start="281.77" dur="5.549">brain I want to go through kind of what</text>
  <text start="285.19" dur="3.479">you know about the secret space program</text>
  <text start="287.319" dur="3.901">and the aliens and the hidden history</text>
  <text start="288.669" dur="4.47">and how that you know if we can wrap it</text>
  <text start="291.22" dur="4.62">up into something that makes sense for</text>
  <text start="293.139" dur="4.801">people in terms of the modern-day powers</text>
  <text start="295.84" dur="4.5">that be the Cabal and how they&amp;#39;re behind</text>
  <text start="297.94" dur="3.75">this stuff mm-hmm let&amp;#39;s start with the</text>
  <text start="300.34" dur="4.199">history if you don&amp;#39;t mind like I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="301.69" dur="4.289">doing a lot of research into you know</text>
  <text start="304.539" dur="3.81">some of the things that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="305.979" dur="4.861">suppressed some of the the megalithic</text>
  <text start="308.349" dur="3.901">structures in the past some of the giant</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="4.98">skeletons that they&amp;#39;ve unearthed and</text>
  <text start="312.25" dur="5.97">then in many cases disappeared one of my</text>
  <text start="315.82" dur="4.98">favorites is the hypogeum an island at</text>
  <text start="318.22" dur="4.71">Malta where they had thousands of</text>
  <text start="320.8" dur="4.2">skeletons with you know the weird</text>
  <text start="322.93" dur="3.989">elongated skulls which they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="325" dur="5.099">giants they were regular-sized skeletons</text>
  <text start="326.919" dur="4.74">but stories of you know classes of</text>
  <text start="330.099" dur="5.011">children going missing down there and</text>
  <text start="331.659" dur="5.401">these you know triple-layer catacombs</text>
  <text start="335.11" dur="4.35">beneath the island and then one woman</text>
  <text start="337.06" dur="4.229">from she actually sometimes I say the US</text>
  <text start="339.46" dur="3.87">government but I rechecked the story she</text>
  <text start="341.289" dur="4.47">worked for the UK government she was</text>
  <text start="343.33" dur="4.47">there on holiday and they go down with</text>
  <text start="345.759" dur="3.78">these tours with just a candle each you</text>
  <text start="347.8" dur="4.41">know really creepy three stories deep</text>
  <text start="349.539" dur="5.85">and she saw giants she swears she saw</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="5.79">giants so what do you know about the</text>
  <text start="355.389" dur="6.891">Giants like what&amp;#39;s going on there I</text>
  <text start="358" dur="8.61">don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s aliens or demons or</text>
  <text start="362.28" dur="5.979">here either totally men yeah when it</text>
  <text start="366.61" dur="3.29">comes to the ancient history of course</text>
  <text start="368.259" dur="3.541">that&amp;#39;s a lot more convoluted than</text>
  <text start="369.9" dur="3.73">understanding at least the recent</text>
  <text start="371.8" dur="3.899">history of it I would like to talk about</text>
  <text start="373.63" dur="3.87">the recent history surrounding world war</text>
  <text start="375.699" dur="3.421">two - now we can touch on that in a few</text>
  <text start="377.5" dur="3.75">minutes here but at least in regards to</text>
  <text start="379.12" dur="4.289">the ancient history I&amp;#39;m glad that you</text>
  <text start="381.25" dur="6.36">brought up the elongated skulls because</text>
  <text start="383.409" dur="7.531">there are many pieces of evidence around</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="7.32">the world even of elongated skulls being</text>
  <text start="390.94" dur="6.57">found there&amp;#39;s evidence of giant bones</text>
  <text start="394.93" dur="4.38">giant skeletons being found Catalina</text>
  <text start="397.51" dur="3.36">Island off the coast of California was a</text>
  <text start="399.31" dur="3.99">huge hot spot near the end of eight</text>
  <text start="400.87" dur="5.31">hunt at the end of the 1800s there were</text>
  <text start="403.3" dur="4.65">diggers unearthing lots of weird stuff</text>
  <text start="406.18" dur="3.87">in there and then would actually often</text>
  <text start="407.95" dur="3.87">happens is that the Smithsonian comes in</text>
  <text start="410.05" dur="4.35">and the Smithsonian says yeah we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="411.82" dur="3.75">gonna take this and exhibit it and you</text>
  <text start="414.4" dur="2.55">know we&amp;#39;ll give you a check or you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="415.57" dur="3.3">gonna be famous and your name&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="416.95" dur="3.51">on it something like that but then turns</text>
  <text start="418.87" dur="3.69">out the Smithsonian is just a cover</text>
  <text start="420.46" dur="4.5">organization they swiped the evidence</text>
  <text start="422.56" dur="4.95">they never talked to that whoever owned</text>
  <text start="424.96" dur="5.31">the property again or the archeologists</text>
  <text start="427.51" dur="5.31">and that&amp;#39;s how they cover up quite a bit</text>
  <text start="430.27" dur="4.53">of archaeological history is through the</text>
  <text start="432.82" dur="3.69">Smithsonian right that&amp;#39;s the ones that</text>
  <text start="434.8" dur="3.36">we already always taught to trust it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.51" dur="4.77">always those authorities they cover it</text>
  <text start="438.16" dur="4.92">up so that being said there&amp;#39;s plenty of</text>
  <text start="441.28" dur="4.74">evidence for elongated skull peoples</text>
  <text start="443.08" dur="5.07">there&amp;#39;s a lot of evidence for giant</text>
  <text start="446.02" dur="6.99">skeletons being found across the world</text>
  <text start="448.15" dur="6.48">and then what I also like to do to kind</text>
  <text start="453.01" dur="3.48">of get a clearer picture of what&amp;#39;s gone</text>
  <text start="454.63" dur="5.7">on in our ancient history thousands of</text>
  <text start="456.49" dur="6.36">years ago is really look towards myths</text>
  <text start="460.33" dur="4.53">and ancient scripture not just one</text>
  <text start="462.85" dur="3.33">scripture that&amp;#39;s a problem I often find</text>
  <text start="464.86" dur="3">people you know they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="466.18" dur="4.05">closed-minded they like one book and</text>
  <text start="467.86" dur="4.26">they think all truth comes from one book</text>
  <text start="470.23" dur="2.94">but in finally across all the different</text>
  <text start="472.12" dur="2.61">cultures right</text>
  <text start="473.17" dur="3.12">yeah it&amp;#39;s across all the different</text>
  <text start="474.73" dur="4.23">cultures and in fact if you research</text>
  <text start="476.29" dur="4.86">Greek mythology and ancient Vedic</text>
  <text start="478.96" dur="3.51">scriptures out of India and Sumerian</text>
  <text start="481.15" dur="3.51">mythology there&amp;#39;s actually running</text>
  <text start="482.47" dur="4.94">themes there&amp;#39;s archetypal themes that go</text>
  <text start="484.66" dur="5.25">through all of these different myths and</text>
  <text start="487.41" dur="4.53">one of those themes includes the fact</text>
  <text start="489.91" dur="6.17">that there could have very well been a</text>
  <text start="491.94" dur="7.09">what we could call pre human</text>
  <text start="496.08" dur="5.08">civilization being older than Egypt</text>
  <text start="499.03" dur="4.01">Atlantis I&amp;#39;m talking about here or you</text>
  <text start="501.16" dur="3.93">know call it what you will but a</text>
  <text start="503.04" dur="7.72">advanced civilization that existed</text>
  <text start="505.09" dur="7.65">before Egypt and Mesopotamia and ancient</text>
  <text start="510.76" dur="5.04">Asia from a few thousand years ago so</text>
  <text start="512.74" dur="5.13">there&amp;#39;s ancient civilizations and</text>
  <text start="515.8" dur="6.3">earlier you mentioned the megalithic</text>
  <text start="517.87" dur="7.65">structures so say okay let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="522.1" dur="6.18">ancient Egypt and what&amp;#39;s going down with</text>
  <text start="525.52" dur="4.8">gone down in South America I mean just</text>
  <text start="528.28" dur="6.12">look at the structures look at the Great</text>
  <text start="530.32" dur="6.42">Pyramid look at these giant thousand ton</text>
  <text start="534.4" dur="4.95">bricks that are evenly cut laser</text>
  <text start="536.74" dur="4.59">precision how does this happen can&amp;#39;t fit</text>
  <text start="539.35" dur="5.28">a hair between them basically literally</text>
  <text start="541.33" dur="6.27">yeah exactly like so logical thinking</text>
  <text start="544.63" dur="6.15">then deduces the fact that they must</text>
  <text start="547.6" dur="5.82">have either had a a capability in this</text>
  <text start="550.78" dur="5">far advanced science that our current</text>
  <text start="553.42" dur="5.31">mainstream model does not touch on</text>
  <text start="555.78" dur="6.43">Sciences that have to do with vibration</text>
  <text start="558.73" dur="5.19">and frequency and various modes of</text>
  <text start="562.21" dur="3.45">thinking like that and not only this but</text>
  <text start="563.92" dur="4.86">how the heck did they even get to</text>
  <text start="565.66" dur="6.03">science how did they proportional eyes</text>
  <text start="568.78" dur="5.25">the great pyramid to be so perfect and</text>
  <text start="571.69" dur="5.04">how the heck did they get those again</text>
  <text start="574.03" dur="4.23">hundred ton stones up there it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="576.73" dur="3.9">slave labor they didn&amp;#39;t put these stones</text>
  <text start="578.26" dur="3.78">on what do they often say tree stumps</text>
  <text start="580.63" dur="3.84">and just like push them along with some</text>
  <text start="582.04" dur="6.36">slaves like that&amp;#39;s such a lame cover</text>
  <text start="584.47" dur="6.06">story really looking at it all the</text>
  <text start="588.4" dur="5.91">pieces together you know I do believe</text>
  <text start="590.53" dur="6.12">that that idea of ancient aliens I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="594.31" dur="5.25">like to use that terminology but the</text>
  <text start="596.65" dur="6.84">fact that our ancient civilizations here</text>
  <text start="599.56" dur="6.45">did have contact with outside beings you</text>
  <text start="603.49" dur="7.77">can look at Christian artwork there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.01" dur="8.82">lots of pieces of art in Europe from the</text>
  <text start="611.26" dur="5.19">Roman era and even little sooner than</text>
  <text start="614.83" dur="4.59">that five six hundred years ago that</text>
  <text start="616.45" dur="5.28">show you have the show saucer craft in</text>
  <text start="619.42" dur="6.96">the sky as many different artworks and</text>
  <text start="621.73" dur="6.15">then in Egypt we have hieroglyphics that</text>
  <text start="626.38" dur="2.64">were engraved into the stone that</text>
  <text start="627.88" dur="4.02">literally looked like helicopters</text>
  <text start="629.02" dur="5.61">helicopters flying craft flying discs</text>
  <text start="631.9" dur="7.62">you can look at the Vedic texts from</text>
  <text start="634.63" dur="7.95">India 3000 BC floating towers talking</text>
  <text start="639.52" dur="5.04">about Vimanas talking about flying boats</text>
  <text start="642.58" dur="4.35">from the Sun as they were described in</text>
  <text start="644.56" dur="6.24">those texts and they used a counter</text>
  <text start="646.93" dur="6.24">rotating vortexing mercury to float to</text>
  <text start="650.8" dur="4.65">float and levitate so oh oh there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="653.17" dur="5.67">many there&amp;#39;s so much out there to help</text>
  <text start="655.45" dur="6.48">piece this all together with and one</text>
  <text start="658.84" dur="5.31">more thing on all of this is getting</text>
  <text start="661.93" dur="5.22">back to the idea of elongated skull</text>
  <text start="664.15" dur="4.05">peoples and the giants okay so you</text>
  <text start="667.15" dur="3.51">mentioned earlier</text>
  <text start="668.2" dur="5.13">are they aliens are they demons etc etc</text>
  <text start="670.66" dur="5.76">you know touching on that really quick a</text>
  <text start="673.33" dur="5.46">lot of people throw the interdimensional</text>
  <text start="676.42" dur="5.1">word out there and when they say uh</text>
  <text start="678.79" dur="4.71">aliens are interdimensional I like to</text>
  <text start="681.52" dur="5.04">correct in a particular way and say that</text>
  <text start="683.5" dur="5.39">well yeah they&amp;#39;re interdimensional</text>
  <text start="686.56" dur="5.87">technically we are interdimensional too</text>
  <text start="688.89" dur="5.68">but they are both interplanetary and</text>
  <text start="692.43" dur="4.54">multi-dimensional okay they have</text>
  <text start="694.57" dur="4.5">physical bodies just like we do humanoid</text>
  <text start="696.97" dur="6.69">we could call five star five point</text>
  <text start="699.07" dur="7.14">frames head two arms two legs but they</text>
  <text start="703.66" dur="3.87">are also multi-dimensional and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="706.21" dur="4.08">more advanced than we are so they have</text>
  <text start="707.53" dur="5.64">more multi-dimensional capabilities than</text>
  <text start="710.29" dur="4.62">we do with their consciousness but at</text>
  <text start="713.17" dur="3.27">least in regards to how they got here</text>
  <text start="714.91" dur="3.21">thousands and thousands and thousands of</text>
  <text start="716.44" dur="2.88">years ago we have all this evidence of</text>
  <text start="718.12" dur="4.5">you know elongated skulls being</text>
  <text start="719.32" dur="8.22">uncovered and giant bones etc etc well</text>
  <text start="722.62" dur="6.93">again getting back to melding science</text>
  <text start="727.54" dur="5.9">and myth science and Scripture</text>
  <text start="729.55" dur="7.35">the Book of Enoch Book of Enoch that was</text>
  <text start="733.44" dur="6.55">sanitized out of Christian teachings for</text>
  <text start="736.9" dur="4.56">very specific reasons yeah yeah pressed</text>
  <text start="739.99" dur="6.93">out of it totally when you actually read</text>
  <text start="741.46" dur="7.67">that it makes references to the Fallen</text>
  <text start="746.92" dur="4.53">Angels that they call it fallen angels</text>
  <text start="749.13" dur="4.39">exactly the watchers and then the</text>
  <text start="751.45" dur="4.8">Nephilim the Nephilim being the beams</text>
  <text start="753.52" dur="4.98">that they like fiddled with here on this</text>
  <text start="756.25" dur="4.23">planet well who are the fallen angels</text>
  <text start="758.5" dur="6.27">fallen angels are these giants that</text>
  <text start="760.48" dur="6.03">these elongated skull peoples and you</text>
  <text start="764.77" dur="5.64">can connect a few more dots again this</text>
  <text start="766.51" dur="5.82">is just speculate or II here but where</text>
  <text start="770.41" dur="4.8">did they come from how did they get onto</text>
  <text start="772.33" dur="5.52">this planet I would say personally</text>
  <text start="775.21" dur="4.83">through my research that they may have</text>
  <text start="777.85" dur="3.93">very well actually came from this solar</text>
  <text start="780.04" dur="3.99">system not from another solar system but</text>
  <text start="781.78" dur="4.19">this one and the reason I say that is</text>
  <text start="784.03" dur="5.19">because there could have very well been</text>
  <text start="785.97" dur="5.14">another planet in this solar system that</text>
  <text start="789.22" dur="4.14">planet being called we could call it</text>
  <text start="791.11" dur="5.43">mall Dec we could call it tiem ah it</text>
  <text start="793.36" dur="5.43">goes by many different names in Greek</text>
  <text start="796.54" dur="5.03">myths I believe they called it Phaeton</text>
  <text start="798.79" dur="5.99">PHA eto n</text>
  <text start="801.57" dur="6.63">but anyway this planet used to be or</text>
  <text start="804.78" dur="4.95">what is now the asteroid belt how did</text>
  <text start="808.2" dur="3.9">the asteroid belt get there why are</text>
  <text start="809.73" dur="4.41">these thousands of you know small</text>
  <text start="812.1" dur="5">asteroids how did that happen well if</text>
  <text start="814.14" dur="5.28">you actually look into the work of a</text>
  <text start="817.1" dur="5.08">scientific work from a couple decades</text>
  <text start="819.42" dur="4.41">ago his name was dr. Thomas Van Flandern</text>
  <text start="822.18" dur="5.01">if I&amp;#39;m getting that correct</text>
  <text start="823.83" dur="7.64">he was a astronomer for the Navy he</text>
  <text start="827.19" dur="7.71">worked at the Naval Observatory and he</text>
  <text start="831.47" dur="5.98">actually posited that the asteroid belt</text>
  <text start="834.9" dur="3.84">used to be a body that somehow exploded</text>
  <text start="837.45" dur="4.82">used to be a celestial body that</text>
  <text start="838.74" dur="5.73">exploded Mars was actually a moon of it</text>
  <text start="842.27" dur="4.51">that&amp;#39;s why when you look at Mars there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="844.47" dur="6.36">this massive scratch on the surface of</text>
  <text start="846.78" dur="6.15">Mars like an explosion happened and that</text>
  <text start="850.83" dur="4.86">planetary explosion that was Maldek is</text>
  <text start="852.93" dur="7.23">now the asteroid belt and again positing</text>
  <text start="855.69" dur="6.3">with ancient life into the picture that</text>
  <text start="860.16" dur="3.84">those elongated school peoples those</text>
  <text start="861.99" dur="3.9">giants I think we used to live on that</text>
  <text start="864" dur="5.46">big planet used to live on Maldek and</text>
  <text start="865.89" dur="7.14">then once there there could have been an</text>
  <text start="869.46" dur="4.59">ancient inter civilization war or</text>
  <text start="873.03" dur="5.34">something that effect</text>
  <text start="874.05" dur="5.64">planet exploded very funny kind of truth</text>
  <text start="878.37" dur="3.96">in plain sight through Hollywood in the</text>
  <text start="879.69" dur="6.15">last couple years did you watch the Star</text>
  <text start="882.33" dur="5.91">Wars what was it the the new one that</text>
  <text start="885.84" dur="5.67">came out a few years ago where they had</text>
  <text start="888.24" dur="7.53">a planet killing Death Star that was</text>
  <text start="891.51" dur="6.84">exploding planets in the sky did you see</text>
  <text start="895.77" dur="4.23">that I&amp;#39;m yeah I saw it I don&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="898.35" dur="3.06">all the details okay I can&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="900" dur="2.88">the name of what they&amp;#39;ve come out with</text>
  <text start="901.41" dur="5.43">like four or five star wars movies in</text>
  <text start="902.88" dur="5.16">the past like eight months but this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="906.84" dur="2.94">like truth in plain sight right there</text>
  <text start="908.04" dur="5.6">they were giving us through the Disney</text>
  <text start="909.78" dur="6.21">remake of Star Wars in that there are</text>
  <text start="913.64" dur="4.9">basically planet annihilating</text>
  <text start="915.99" dur="3.9">technologies out there and that has</text>
  <text start="918.54" dur="3.24">actually happened in our solar system</text>
  <text start="919.89" dur="4.29">before they say a galaxy far far away a</text>
  <text start="921.78" dur="6.69">long long time ago well that galaxy</text>
  <text start="924.18" dur="6.63">might have been not so far away and that</text>
  <text start="928.47" dur="4.56">civilization then escaped that big old</text>
  <text start="930.81" dur="4.399">planet that blew up could have gone to</text>
  <text start="933.03" dur="4.13">Mars for a little bit but with an</text>
  <text start="935.209" dur="6.451">lotion like that Mars likely lost his</text>
  <text start="937.16" dur="6.539">atmosphere lost a lot of life that was</text>
  <text start="941.66" dur="3.989">able to habitate there so then those</text>
  <text start="943.699" dur="6.57">elongated skull peoples those giants</text>
  <text start="945.649" dur="5.85">that then came to earth and this could</text>
  <text start="950.269" dur="2.82">have been a few hundred thousand years</text>
  <text start="951.499" dur="5.19">ago some say maybe a few million years</text>
  <text start="953.089" dur="6.93">ago but then what they did is that they</text>
  <text start="956.689" dur="4.801">came to earth here some also believed</text>
  <text start="960.019" dur="6.68">that they may have crash-landed in</text>
  <text start="961.49" dur="8.039">Antarctica could be and some of their</text>
  <text start="966.699" dur="5.14">ancient civilization could be under the</text>
  <text start="969.529" dur="4.951">ice there in Antarctica but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="971.839" dur="5.1">intriguing is that when they crashed</text>
  <text start="974.48" dur="6.659">here it looks like they began expanding</text>
  <text start="976.939" dur="6.39">out on this planet they started some</text>
  <text start="981.139" dur="3.901">communities in South America they could</text>
  <text start="983.329" dur="6.18">have started some communities there in</text>
  <text start="985.04" dur="6.75">the Middle East and that&amp;#39;s where we get</text>
  <text start="989.509" dur="4.74">and in Egypt as well and that&amp;#39;s why in</text>
  <text start="991.79" dur="4.349">the myths from those areas for instance</text>
  <text start="994.249" dur="4.26">Egypt they show people with elongated</text>
  <text start="996.139" dur="4.26">skulls their rulers yeah elongated</text>
  <text start="998.509" dur="6.36">skulls there&amp;#39;s gods exactly same thing</text>
  <text start="1000.399" dur="9.6">with same thing with South America there</text>
  <text start="1004.869" dur="6.39">and then the idea of the dark stuff kind</text>
  <text start="1009.999" dur="2.671">of comes into the picture like human</text>
  <text start="1011.259" dur="2.851">sacrifice where did that come from why</text>
  <text start="1012.67" dur="4.859">were people in South America so obsessed</text>
  <text start="1014.11" dur="4.979">with human sacrifice well a lot of these</text>
  <text start="1017.529" dur="4.11">elongated skull folk that did come down</text>
  <text start="1019.089" dur="5.61">here we could say that maybe they</text>
  <text start="1021.639" dur="5.611">weren&amp;#39;t the best beings they weren&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="1024.699" dur="4.23">most friendly they started fiddling with</text>
  <text start="1027.25" dur="3.449">the very primitive life on this planet</text>
  <text start="1028.929" dur="3.39">and that&amp;#39;s the idea of the Fallen Angels</text>
  <text start="1030.699" dur="4.521">the Fallen Angels these elongated skull</text>
  <text start="1032.319" dur="5.551">people and the Nephilim were the</text>
  <text start="1035.22" dur="5.05">essentially the Giants they created the</text>
  <text start="1037.87" dur="7.86">offspring that were half et basically</text>
  <text start="1040.27" dur="6.99">half human and those those were the</text>
  <text start="1045.73" dur="3.569">rulers of the societies that showed</text>
  <text start="1047.26" dur="3.72">their face these elongated skull people</text>
  <text start="1049.299" dur="3.6">as they don&amp;#39;t show their face you know</text>
  <text start="1050.98" dur="4.5">they they&amp;#39;re the ones that stay behind</text>
  <text start="1052.899" dur="4.951">the scenes of course so the rulers were</text>
  <text start="1055.48" dur="6.6">these offspring these genetically</text>
  <text start="1057.85" dur="6.39">tinkered with offspring and they brought</text>
  <text start="1062.08" dur="4.41">their belief systems they brought their</text>
  <text start="1064.24" dur="3.689">rituals they brought their basically</text>
  <text start="1066.49" dur="2.55">their information to the very primitive</text>
  <text start="1067.929" dur="3.301">people that they be</text>
  <text start="1069.04" dur="5.4">and grooming on this planet and that</text>
  <text start="1071.23" dur="4.83">leads us to you know the prehistoric and</text>
  <text start="1074.44" dur="3.29">historic civilizations on this planet</text>
  <text start="1076.06" dur="4.05">here so again it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a long</text>
  <text start="1077.73" dur="3.79">convoluted history that I&amp;#39;m still trying</text>
  <text start="1080.11" dur="3.45">to piece together that a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1081.52" dur="4.74">out there trying to piece together and</text>
  <text start="1083.56" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s some I mean thanks for having me on</text>
  <text start="1086.26" dur="3.93">to talk about it all because it is</text>
  <text start="1088.42" dur="4.29">something that&amp;#39;s definitely outside the</text>
  <text start="1090.19" dur="3.78">box it is and it&amp;#39;s gonna be huh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1092.71" dur="3.63">gonna be difficult for a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1093.97" dur="4.8">to believe but you know yeah look into</text>
  <text start="1096.34" dur="4.44">at least what we know is this across</text>
  <text start="1098.77" dur="5.25">multiple continents of unconnected</text>
  <text start="1100.78" dur="5.55">cultures had no connection at all during</text>
  <text start="1104.02" dur="6.84">those time periods they all spoke of</text>
  <text start="1106.33" dur="6.09">giants most of them did in many cases</text>
  <text start="1110.86" dur="3.27">these giants had a trend for eating</text>
  <text start="1112.42" dur="3.75">children and you know described as</text>
  <text start="1114.13" dur="4.11">having red hair so that was unusual and</text>
  <text start="1116.17" dur="4.32">these elongated skulls or recurring</text>
  <text start="1118.24" dur="3.99">theme as well the bearded gods in</text>
  <text start="1120.49" dur="3.72">ancient scripture whether it&amp;#39;s Christian</text>
  <text start="1122.23" dur="4.14">or this religion that religion they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1124.21" dur="7.17">the bearded gods and just like you said</text>
  <text start="1126.37" dur="6.75">they had their sacrificial rituals that</text>
  <text start="1131.38" dur="4.05">they brought here the more black magic</text>
  <text start="1133.12" dur="6.06">rituals instead of the more positive</text>
  <text start="1135.43" dur="6.06">white magic you could call it and kind</text>
  <text start="1139.18" dur="4.11">of bringing this to present-day jumping</text>
  <text start="1141.49" dur="3.96">ahead a few thousand years what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1143.29" dur="4.41">intriguing is that when you look at some</text>
  <text start="1145.45" dur="4.35">of the elites that do show their faces</text>
  <text start="1147.7" dur="4.68">you know well what do we know about the</text>
  <text start="1149.8" dur="4.53">elites they like their bloodlines but my</text>
  <text start="1152.38" dur="4.71">family is 13 family is call it what you</text>
  <text start="1154.33" dur="5.04">want they&amp;#39;re they always seem to like</text>
  <text start="1157.09" dur="4.38">interbreed keep to themselves well the</text>
  <text start="1159.37" dur="4.32">reason being is because they believe</text>
  <text start="1161.47" dur="4.41">themselves to have the genetic lineage</text>
  <text start="1163.69" dur="3.78">from these fallen angels or from these</text>
  <text start="1165.88" dur="5.01">bearded gods so they like to keep</text>
  <text start="1167.47" dur="5.31">themselves pure and that&amp;#39;s why they look</text>
  <text start="1170.89" dur="6.38">at humanity that&amp;#39;s why they look at us</text>
  <text start="1172.78" dur="6.6">as being basically this swine this</text>
  <text start="1177.27" dur="4.36">compromised you know we have dirty</text>
  <text start="1179.38" dur="5.4">genetics to them that&amp;#39;s why they have no</text>
  <text start="1181.63" dur="5.1">problem with depopulating us and doing</text>
  <text start="1184.78" dur="4.05">their ritual sacrifice and offing</text>
  <text start="1186.73" dur="4.74">literally the planet for their agenda</text>
  <text start="1188.83" dur="3.84">because this is their belief system like</text>
  <text start="1191.47" dur="3.39">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what we believe it</text>
  <text start="1192.67" dur="4.05">matters what they believe this is what</text>
  <text start="1194.86" dur="3.72">they believe yeah well I mean it does</text>
  <text start="1196.72" dur="4.92">matter what we believe but you know in</text>
  <text start="1198.58" dur="4.38">looking it&amp;#39;s very important what they</text>
  <text start="1201.64" dur="2.909">believe and this is what they</text>
  <text start="1202.96" dur="7.199">literally they believe themselves to be</text>
  <text start="1204.549" dur="8.581">some higher better more pure being than</text>
  <text start="1210.159" dur="6.24">we are so this is why they do their dark</text>
  <text start="1213.13" dur="5.159">occult ritual practice yeah everybody</text>
  <text start="1216.399" dur="4.981">knows that they&amp;#39;re into the occult and</text>
  <text start="1218.289" dur="4.981">the ritual stuff and to take that a</text>
  <text start="1221.38" dur="3.6">little further it seems like they do</text>
  <text start="1223.27" dur="3.48">have this bloodline obsession this</text>
  <text start="1224.98" dur="3.27">genetic obsession yeah and you can</text>
  <text start="1226.75" dur="3.39">actually look at some of the elites and</text>
  <text start="1228.25" dur="4.799">kind of look at their skull and see</text>
  <text start="1230.14" dur="3.87">remnants of like what could be a weird</text>
  <text start="1233.049" dur="2.521">shaped skull</text>
  <text start="1234.01" dur="3">I think the Rothschilds if you look at</text>
  <text start="1235.57" dur="3.75">Jacob Rothschild a picture of him he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1237.01" dur="4.289">got like a funky looking head and Simon</text>
  <text start="1239.32" dur="3.9">Parkes there&amp;#39;s a few of them out there</text>
  <text start="1241.299" dur="3.51">and what&amp;#39;s also interesting is that when</text>
  <text start="1243.22" dur="3.6">you look at the Vatican why are they</text>
  <text start="1244.809" dur="3.931">always have their funny hats trying to</text>
  <text start="1246.82" dur="3.81">hide something up there well no what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1248.74" dur="3.809">not why did they put out the conehead</text>
  <text start="1250.63" dur="4.62">movie in the 1980s or whatever remember</text>
  <text start="1252.549" dur="4.831">the Coneheads yeah big ol elongated</text>
  <text start="1255.25" dur="3.899">skulls like again more evidence of truth</text>
  <text start="1257.38" dur="3.779">in plain sight and just like you</text>
  <text start="1259.149" dur="5.461">mentioned a minute ago you know this is</text>
  <text start="1261.159" dur="4.89">some could seem like wacky stuff but</text>
  <text start="1264.61" dur="7.309">that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m trying to throw out as</text>
  <text start="1266.049" dur="8.791">many scientific names as I can like dr.</text>
  <text start="1271.919" dur="5.921">van Flandern who is looking at the</text>
  <text start="1274.84" dur="4.8">celestial bodies and figured that one</text>
  <text start="1277.84" dur="5.43">might have exploded you have Lloyd Pye</text>
  <text start="1279.64" dur="5.49">Lloyd Pye recently passed away he did a</text>
  <text start="1283.27" dur="4.8">lot of work into studying human genetics</text>
  <text start="1285.13" dur="6.69">and he had a lot of questions why do we</text>
  <text start="1288.07" dur="5.18">have a fused chromosome that&amp;#39;s weird</text>
  <text start="1291.82" dur="4.38">that shouldn&amp;#39;t happen that&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="1293.25" dur="5.289">evolutionary byproduct there you know we</text>
  <text start="1296.2" dur="4.17">are we have a couple chromosomes fused</text>
  <text start="1298.539" dur="4.951">so it actually gives us a couple less</text>
  <text start="1300.37" dur="4.26">than modern Apes so there&amp;#39;s evidence of</text>
  <text start="1303.49" dur="2.309">genetic tampering right there and</text>
  <text start="1304.63" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s a lot of other things that Lloyd</text>
  <text start="1305.799" dur="7.74">Pye looked into so there&amp;#39;s so many the</text>
  <text start="1308.98" dur="6.689">thing is that you can create these what</text>
  <text start="1313.539" dur="4.74">we could call educated speculations of</text>
  <text start="1315.669" dur="3.781">history or of reality right now thing is</text>
  <text start="1318.279" dur="4.89">you just have to look across the board</text>
  <text start="1319.45" dur="5.88">at so many different researchers and put</text>
  <text start="1323.169" dur="5.341">all the dots together you know yeah we</text>
  <text start="1325.33" dur="5.339">know the Rh negative thing seems to be a</text>
  <text start="1328.51" dur="4.68">genetic proof that we&amp;#39;re a tampered</text>
  <text start="1330.669" dur="4.321">species or hybrid species because you</text>
  <text start="1333.19" dur="3.56">know that doesn&amp;#39;t generally occur in</text>
  <text start="1334.99" dur="3.32">other species that the only other</text>
  <text start="1336.75" dur="4.32">that will reject its own offspring that</text>
  <text start="1338.31" dur="5.01">I know it was a donkey so that can</text>
  <text start="1341.07" dur="4.68">happen with Rh negative mothers yeah I</text>
  <text start="1343.32" dur="4.11">believe 15% or somewhere around that of</text>
  <text start="1345.75" dur="5.43">the population has an Rh negative gene</text>
  <text start="1347.43" dur="5.94">yeah so is that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a genetic kind</text>
  <text start="1351.18" dur="4.77">of proof if you look at it and I know</text>
  <text start="1353.37" dur="3.99">that they&amp;#39;ve suppressed from a</text>
  <text start="1355.95" dur="3.27">technological standpoint there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1357.36" dur="5.22">of science that we take as granted like</text>
  <text start="1359.22" dur="4.71">the physics and stuff gravity even the</text>
  <text start="1362.58" dur="3.6">whole the whole theory of gravity</text>
  <text start="1363.93" dur="5.16">doesn&amp;#39;t quite hold up it doesn&amp;#39;t seem</text>
  <text start="1366.18" dur="4.44">like the planet is the Sun is stationary</text>
  <text start="1369.09" dur="3.48">and and we&amp;#39;re circling around it it</text>
  <text start="1370.62" dur="3.6">seems like we&amp;#39;re kind of spinning around</text>
  <text start="1372.57" dur="3.21">the visits as it&amp;#39;s moving through space</text>
  <text start="1374.22" dur="4.34">as well so there&amp;#39;s a lot of different</text>
  <text start="1375.78" dur="8.31">things going on that I&amp;#39;m not yeah</text>
  <text start="1378.56" dur="6.82">absolutely and cool so yeah let&amp;#39;s switch</text>
  <text start="1384.09" dur="3.39">a little bit and get on to the science</text>
  <text start="1385.38" dur="5.49">of it all that maybe we can talk about</text>
  <text start="1387.48" dur="5.25">the Nazi history and the build up of the</text>
  <text start="1390.87" dur="6.63">programs and modern times but at least</text>
  <text start="1392.73" dur="7.53">in regards to the sciences yeah gravity</text>
  <text start="1397.5" dur="4.53">is completely not what we are told not</text>
  <text start="1400.26" dur="4.56">saying gravity doesn&amp;#39;t exist it does</text>
  <text start="1402.03" dur="4.02">exist time does exist it&amp;#39;s just they</text>
  <text start="1404.82" dur="3.17">don&amp;#39;t exist in the ways that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1406.05" dur="4.68">specifically taught by mainstream</text>
  <text start="1407.99" dur="5.14">theories are still flawed exactly</text>
  <text start="1410.73" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re very flawed and it&amp;#39;s funny that</text>
  <text start="1413.13" dur="4.68">they always promote the mainstream</text>
  <text start="1415.44" dur="4.8">scientists that fit their agenda like</text>
  <text start="1417.81" dur="4.47">Albert Einstein poor Albert Einstein he</text>
  <text start="1420.24" dur="4.38">had a couple things wrong in his general</text>
  <text start="1422.28" dur="4.62">relativity theories but it was very</text>
  <text start="1424.62" dur="3.93">useful to the elite that he was wrong so</text>
  <text start="1426.9" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s why they promote him as being the</text>
  <text start="1428.55" dur="5.7">most genius figure ever but you hardly</text>
  <text start="1431.76" dur="5.1">hear a lick of those like Nikola Tesla</text>
  <text start="1434.25" dur="5.67">or Walter Russell or Dewey B Larsen you</text>
  <text start="1436.86" dur="6.12">know the work of people like this they</text>
  <text start="1439.92" dur="4.98">were actually finding that we live one</text>
  <text start="1442.98" dur="6.62">in an electric universe everything is</text>
  <text start="1444.9" dur="9.18">electric but be gravity is not a</text>
  <text start="1449.6" dur="7.06">radiation like force what I mean by that</text>
  <text start="1454.08" dur="4.77">is that what scientists are trying to do</text>
  <text start="1456.66" dur="4.32">in modern times is find gravitational</text>
  <text start="1458.85" dur="4.68">waves they&amp;#39;re trying to act like gravity</text>
  <text start="1460.98" dur="4.53">is this radiative force that&amp;#39;s always a</text>
  <text start="1463.53" dur="4.11">meeting from somewhere but it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="1465.51" dur="4.29">not when you look at gravity gravity is</text>
  <text start="1467.64" dur="5.16">the yin to</text>
  <text start="1469.8" dur="4.56">elect true electricity&amp;#39;s yang gravity</text>
  <text start="1472.8" dur="3.27">and radiation or union yang forces so</text>
  <text start="1474.36" dur="3.96">gravity is actually an inward force</text>
  <text start="1476.07" dur="5.42">that&amp;#39;s moving into all matter at all</text>
  <text start="1478.32" dur="6.24">times to create that matter gravity is</text>
  <text start="1481.49" dur="6.6">not a pull it&amp;#39;s really a it&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="1484.56" dur="6.09">push and it&amp;#39;s a compressive push it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1488.09" dur="5.8">compression as exposed as opposed to</text>
  <text start="1490.65" dur="4.89">explosion right so we have implosion</text>
  <text start="1493.89" dur="4.05">explosion gravity is always moving</text>
  <text start="1495.54" dur="6.05">inward in very specific sacred</text>
  <text start="1497.94" dur="7.32">geometrical ratios and if you harness</text>
  <text start="1501.59" dur="9.1">the geometry of torsion of the idea of</text>
  <text start="1505.26" dur="8.1">spin into matter you can play around</text>
  <text start="1510.69" dur="4.41">with gravity you can alter it that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1513.36" dur="3.21">the science of electrogravitics is</text>
  <text start="1515.1" dur="3.33">called that because electricity and</text>
  <text start="1516.57" dur="3.78">gravity are coupled when you look into</text>
  <text start="1518.43" dur="3.57">what Nikola Tesla was doing he was doing</text>
  <text start="1520.35" dur="3.87">research into electrogravitics and</text>
  <text start="1522" dur="5.25">people like Nikola there T Townsend</text>
  <text start="1524.22" dur="6.63">Brown excuse me so big ol big ol</text>
  <text start="1527.25" dur="6.66">relearning curve we all need to go on</text>
  <text start="1530.85" dur="4.62">and this kind of this is where you can</text>
  <text start="1533.91" dur="3.03">get those theoretical spacecraft that</text>
  <text start="1535.47" dur="3.27">can go a thousand miles a minute and</text>
  <text start="1536.94" dur="4.05">then turn sharp right without killing</text>
  <text start="1538.74" dur="4.58">everyone inside right exactly because</text>
  <text start="1540.99" dur="6.65">what they do is that for instance like a</text>
  <text start="1543.32" dur="7.78">tr-3b black triangle they essentially</text>
  <text start="1547.64" dur="5.08">through their electrolytic technologies</text>
  <text start="1551.1" dur="3.42">and their mass cancellation technologies</text>
  <text start="1552.72" dur="4.23">they create their own little bubble in</text>
  <text start="1554.52" dur="8.49">space-time so they&amp;#39;re in their own</text>
  <text start="1556.95" dur="8.52">little bubble if you will and that being</text>
  <text start="1563.01" dur="4.95">said they&amp;#39;re not subject to the inertial</text>
  <text start="1565.47" dur="5.97">properties outside that bubble so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1567.96" dur="4.26">why a little tr-3b can go 100 thousand</text>
  <text start="1571.44" dur="3.6">miles an hour</text>
  <text start="1572.22" dur="5.49">make a right-hand turn and to the people</text>
  <text start="1575.04" dur="5.82">inside that bubble inside the craft it</text>
  <text start="1577.71" dur="5.79">might just feel like this but if they</text>
  <text start="1580.86" dur="5.25">didn&amp;#39;t have that inertial shielding then</text>
  <text start="1583.5" dur="6.72">boom it&amp;#39;s flat against a little totally</text>
  <text start="1586.11" dur="6">yeah okay so we know that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1590.22" dur="3.66">great advantage it makes sense if you</text>
  <text start="1592.11" dur="3.6">have special technology especially in</text>
  <text start="1593.88" dur="4.08">like the weapons area but this goes</text>
  <text start="1595.71" dur="5.28">across all technology even as far back</text>
  <text start="1597.96" dur="5.4">as the Romans and the facts if you have</text>
  <text start="1600.99" dur="4.8">an advantage over others then you can</text>
  <text start="1603.36" dur="4.949">get power over them or you can even take</text>
  <text start="1605.79" dur="4.29">it far enough rule the world so I have</text>
  <text start="1608.309" dur="3.151">no trouble believing that there&amp;#39;s hidden</text>
  <text start="1610.08" dur="3.3">technologies things like that that they</text>
  <text start="1611.46" dur="5.52">don&amp;#39;t want us to know about even that</text>
  <text start="1613.38" dur="7.53">they would go so far as to push false or</text>
  <text start="1616.98" dur="5.49">faulty or inferior Sciences on us we</text>
  <text start="1620.91" dur="4.05">know that they were involved with the</text>
  <text start="1622.47" dur="4.17">Tesla cover-up and and that was one of</text>
  <text start="1624.96" dur="4.86">the great crimes against humanity in and</text>
  <text start="1626.64" dur="4.98">of itself how does that lead into like</text>
  <text start="1629.82" dur="4.5">the Nazis in the modern cabal and the</text>
  <text start="1631.62" dur="6.99">breakaway civilization all that totally</text>
  <text start="1634.32" dur="6.66">so when it comes to world war two we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1638.61" dur="4.439">gonna need a massive unlearning and</text>
  <text start="1640.98" dur="6.42">relearning as like so many other topics</text>
  <text start="1643.049" dur="6.301">and particularly in understanding how</text>
  <text start="1647.4" dur="7.769">secret space programs in modern times</text>
  <text start="1649.35" dur="8.16">were created and suppressed and built</text>
  <text start="1655.169" dur="7.321">out in secret really it starts with the</text>
  <text start="1657.51" dur="8.22">early 1900&amp;#39;s in Nazi Germany before</text>
  <text start="1662.49" dur="6.24">World War two so in the in the build-up</text>
  <text start="1665.73" dur="6.48">to World War two in the nineteen you</text>
  <text start="1668.73" dur="6.6">know 20s and 30s on both sides of the</text>
  <text start="1672.21" dur="6.06">Atlantic Ocean in the Americas and in</text>
  <text start="1675.33" dur="6.69">Nazi Germany there they began realizing</text>
  <text start="1678.27" dur="8.399">that there is this science out there</text>
  <text start="1682.02" dur="6.39">that is has been hidden away and that</text>
  <text start="1686.669" dur="6">could tap these certain secrets like</text>
  <text start="1688.41" dur="6.03">gravity control and these you know like</text>
  <text start="1692.669" dur="4.921">you were saying energy directed energy</text>
  <text start="1694.44" dur="5.4">weapons etc etc so for instance nikola</text>
  <text start="1697.59" dur="5.04">tesla was over here in the 20s and 30s</text>
  <text start="1699.84" dur="5.19">doing his work we had the work of viktor</text>
  <text start="1702.63" dur="4.86">schauberger over in germany in the 20s</text>
  <text start="1705.03" dur="5.82">and 30s he was getting into the same</text>
  <text start="1707.49" dur="4.98">kind of principles of implosion figuring</text>
  <text start="1710.85" dur="2.97">out how to actually control gravity he</text>
  <text start="1712.47" dur="4.29">was doing it through water actually</text>
  <text start="1713.82" dur="4.979">viktor schauberger he was vortexing</text>
  <text start="1716.76" dur="4.14">water and a specific geometry and</text>
  <text start="1718.799" dur="4.921">actually creating gravitational lift</text>
  <text start="1720.9" dur="6.72">through that amazing stuff you can do</text>
  <text start="1723.72" dur="5.82">but what began happening in that</text>
  <text start="1727.62" dur="4.97">build-up to World War two is that Nazi</text>
  <text start="1729.54" dur="7.26">Germany they were more interested in</text>
  <text start="1732.59" dur="4.66">this advanced physics than the Americans</text>
  <text start="1736.8" dur="2.49">were</text>
  <text start="1737.25" dur="4.32">and they actually had more access to it</text>
  <text start="1739.29" dur="5.1">than the Americans did so in Nazi</text>
  <text start="1741.57" dur="4.65">Germany they had viktor schauberger who</text>
  <text start="1744.39" dur="4.58">they forced to work for them with his</text>
  <text start="1746.22" dur="6.72">sciences anti-gravity sciences they had</text>
  <text start="1748.97" dur="6.73">maria orsic maria orsic and her group of</text>
  <text start="1752.94" dur="5.16">psychic mediums very psychically gifted</text>
  <text start="1755.7" dur="5.93">girls that were actually channeling they</text>
  <text start="1758.1" dur="7.44">were channeling information from</text>
  <text start="1761.63" dur="5.53">potentially another star system for they</text>
  <text start="1765.54" dur="3.47">were doing it for peaceful purposes</text>
  <text start="1767.16" dur="5.66">originally they just wanted to create</text>
  <text start="1769.01" dur="6.76">disk craft that could help us transport</text>
  <text start="1772.82" dur="5.35">interstellar but the Nazis of course</text>
  <text start="1775.77" dur="4.92">with their maniacal means they forced</text>
  <text start="1778.17" dur="4.65">their research into their programs and</text>
  <text start="1780.69" dur="4.71">there were some other ways as well</text>
  <text start="1782.82" dur="5.49">now on the American side here all we</text>
  <text start="1785.4" dur="4.53">really had was nikola tesla and he</text>
  <text start="1788.31" dur="3.9">didn&amp;#39;t die until 1943</text>
  <text start="1789.93" dur="6.51">so his papers were taken you know late</text>
  <text start="1792.21" dur="6.3">we had a craft that we had a couple of</text>
  <text start="1796.44" dur="3.84">downed craft we had Roswell in 47 that</text>
  <text start="1798.51" dur="4.11">was after World War Two but Roswell</text>
  <text start="1800.28" dur="4.8">actually was not the first downed et</text>
  <text start="1802.62" dur="6.33">craft in America here there was one in</text>
  <text start="1805.08" dur="5.58">1942 two in 1942 actually that went down</text>
  <text start="1808.95" dur="6.03">over Long Beach Harbor in the Battle of</text>
  <text start="1810.66" dur="6.33">Los Angeles incident so okay we had some</text>
  <text start="1814.98" dur="3.84">work of Nikola Tesla we had a couple</text>
  <text start="1816.99" dur="3.9">downed e t-- craft they were trying to</text>
  <text start="1818.82" dur="4.17">reverse engineer but the americans just</text>
  <text start="1820.89" dur="3.84">could not they couldn&amp;#39;t get it they did</text>
  <text start="1822.99" dur="4.92">not have the ability to reverse engineer</text>
  <text start="1824.73" dur="5.82">this stuff like the Nazis did okay</text>
  <text start="1827.91" dur="3.78">so the Americans realize that so they</text>
  <text start="1830.55" dur="3.09">started pumping a lot more of their</text>
  <text start="1831.69" dur="5.85">resources into just building more tanks</text>
  <text start="1833.64" dur="7.26">getting more men the Americans had much</text>
  <text start="1837.54" dur="4.95">more quantity of power than the Nazis</text>
  <text start="1840.9" dur="3.6">did not Caesars didn&amp;#39;t have as many</text>
  <text start="1842.49" dur="3.63">tanks or boots on the ground but they</text>
  <text start="1844.5" dur="4.14">had their advanced physics they were</text>
  <text start="1846.12" dur="5.07">kept secret so once World War two kicked</text>
  <text start="1848.64" dur="4.5">off the Americans joined in 42 and then</text>
  <text start="1851.19" dur="3.84">the ground war in Europe ensued of</text>
  <text start="1853.14" dur="3.72">course the Allies as we know just kicked</text>
  <text start="1855.03" dur="4.02">the crap out of Nazi Germany Nazi</text>
  <text start="1856.86" dur="3.71">Germany they were able to invade but</text>
  <text start="1859.05" dur="4.83">this is where it gets interesting is</text>
  <text start="1860.57" dur="4.45">because in Germany the Germans knew this</text>
  <text start="1863.88" dur="3">they knew they were going to get their</text>
  <text start="1865.02" dur="4.98">asses kicked in Europe so what they</text>
  <text start="1866.88" dur="4.2">began doing in the late 30s was taking a</text>
  <text start="1870" dur="2.46">lot of their resources</text>
  <text start="1871.08" dur="4.17">their research and development down to</text>
  <text start="1872.46" dur="5.13">Antarctica it&amp;#39;s publicly known that they</text>
  <text start="1875.25" dur="4.529">had a stronghold in Argentina in South</text>
  <text start="1877.59" dur="4.37">America so it&amp;#39;s just a hop skip and a</text>
  <text start="1879.779" dur="5.37">jump to Antarctica right there and</text>
  <text start="1881.96" dur="5.65">what&amp;#39;s intriguing and what science is</text>
  <text start="1885.149" dur="5.27">beginning to admit now in our modern</text>
  <text start="1887.61" dur="5.37">times is that there are actually large</text>
  <text start="1890.419" dur="4.661">caverns that are under the ice and</text>
  <text start="1892.98" dur="4.47">Antarctica that are created through</text>
  <text start="1895.08" dur="3.839">volcanic activity their natural caverns</text>
  <text start="1897.45" dur="3.479">and there it&amp;#39;s actually very warm down</text>
  <text start="1898.919" dur="6.48">there it&amp;#39;s like a inside of an igloo a</text>
  <text start="1900.929" dur="8.1">mile under the ice in Antarctica so the</text>
  <text start="1905.399" dur="6.39">Nazis figured this out and that&amp;#39;s why in</text>
  <text start="1909.029" dur="5.161">the late 30s and during the 1940s they</text>
  <text start="1911.789" dur="4.98">began taking their u-boats stocking them</text>
  <text start="1914.19" dur="4.92">with their their saucer craft called</text>
  <text start="1916.769" dur="3.931">Hana booze and whatever else they have</text>
  <text start="1919.11" dur="3.27">in the way of directed energy weapons</text>
  <text start="1920.7" dur="4.829">and they brought a lot of slave labor</text>
  <text start="1922.38" dur="4.5">all of that down to Antarctica a little</text>
  <text start="1925.529" dur="3.15">bit in South America but more so in</text>
  <text start="1926.88" dur="4.289">Antarctica and that&amp;#39;s where they really</text>
  <text start="1928.679" dur="4.261">began building out these programs so of</text>
  <text start="1931.169" dur="5.25">course we had the official ending of</text>
  <text start="1932.94" dur="8.699">World War Two in 1945 but World War two</text>
  <text start="1936.419" dur="5.88">didn&amp;#39;t actually officially end now what</text>
  <text start="1941.639" dur="2.4">had happened</text>
  <text start="1942.299" dur="3.391">you mentioned operation Highjump earlier</text>
  <text start="1944.039" dur="3.841">you know and this is where we get into</text>
  <text start="1945.69" dur="4.349">operation Highjump now the Americans</text>
  <text start="1947.88" dur="3.48">actually knew that the Germans were</text>
  <text start="1950.039" dur="3.63">taking a lot of their stuff down to</text>
  <text start="1951.36" dur="4.77">Antarctica how did they know well the</text>
  <text start="1953.669" dur="4.38">Americans had an espionage program</text>
  <text start="1956.13" dur="4.56">embedded in these German Aerospace</text>
  <text start="1958.049" dur="5.37">programs it was a Navy program there was</text>
  <text start="1960.69" dur="4.32">29 spies during World War two that were</text>
  <text start="1963.419" dur="3.961">embedded in these secret German air</text>
  <text start="1965.01" dur="4.409">aerospace programs and other government</text>
  <text start="1967.38" dur="4.23">programs they were bringing back a bunch</text>
  <text start="1969.419" dur="5.37">of their secrets they were bringing back</text>
  <text start="1971.61" dur="5.279">a bunch of the research and even some of</text>
  <text start="1974.789" dur="5.161">the schematics of the craft and whatnot</text>
  <text start="1976.889" dur="4.981">and they were like what the heck is this</text>
  <text start="1979.95" dur="3.78">stuff because I mean these the Americans</text>
  <text start="1981.87" dur="3.51">really had no idea it was so advanced</text>
  <text start="1983.73" dur="3">outside of their knowledge but they</text>
  <text start="1985.38" dur="3.509">began learning that the Nazis were</text>
  <text start="1986.73" dur="4.77">taking a lot of the research and</text>
  <text start="1988.889" dur="5.371">development down to Antarctica so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1991.5" dur="5.779">why in 1947 they commissioned operation</text>
  <text start="1994.26" dur="7.049">Highjump led by Admiral Richard Byrd and</text>
  <text start="1997.279" dur="6.821">on public record this was said to be a</text>
  <text start="2001.309" dur="3.721">scientific exploration oh yeah he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2004.1" dur="2.49">going down there you know</text>
  <text start="2005.03" dur="3.51">because Admiral Richard Byrd he actually</text>
  <text start="2006.59" dur="4.89">explored Antarctica in the 1910s and 20s</text>
  <text start="2008.54" dur="6.21">he was an explorer and in the 1910s and</text>
  <text start="2011.48" dur="6.57">20s his exploration expeditions were</text>
  <text start="2014.75" dur="4.98">bankrolled basically by the Rockefellers</text>
  <text start="2018.05" dur="3.39">the Rothschilds all the big families</text>
  <text start="2019.73" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s why if you look at a google map</text>
  <text start="2021.44" dur="4.5">and you see Antarctica you can see a</text>
  <text start="2023.33" dur="4.83">rock Rothschild island Rockefeller</text>
  <text start="2025.94" dur="3.6">Plateau because when Admiral Byrd first</text>
  <text start="2028.16" dur="2.88">went down to Antarctica was just</text>
  <text start="2029.54" dur="3.45">exploratory and he was naming what he</text>
  <text start="2031.04" dur="3.63">was finding after the you know the elite</text>
  <text start="2032.99" dur="4.38">families he was going down there for but</text>
  <text start="2034.67" dur="4.83">in 1947 this was different this</text>
  <text start="2037.37" dur="5.01">expedition was fully funded by the US</text>
  <text start="2039.5" dur="7.17">Navy and like I said they called it for</text>
  <text start="2042.38" dur="8.85">science but his operation operation</text>
  <text start="2046.67" dur="7.44">Highjump had 5,000 men some like 40</text>
  <text start="2051.23" dur="5.28">ships 13 aircraft like that that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2054.11" dur="5.52">for science that&amp;#39;s military right there</text>
  <text start="2056.51" dur="7.88">so out Admiral Richard Byrd in February</text>
  <text start="2059.63" dur="7.95">of 1947 went down to Antarctica with his</text>
  <text start="2064.39" dur="6.009">flotilla and he quickly got his ass</text>
  <text start="2067.58" dur="6.15">kicked by the Germans all the German</text>
  <text start="2070.399" dur="7.321">UFOs by this time the Germans were able</text>
  <text start="2073.73" dur="5.79">to create enough flying saucers to be a</text>
  <text start="2077.72" dur="2.939">formidable force for operation Highjump</text>
  <text start="2079.52" dur="3.3">and they had some of their</text>
  <text start="2080.659" dur="4.351">directed-energy their beam weapons that</text>
  <text start="2082.82" dur="3.72">were in operation by them so they just</text>
  <text start="2085.01" dur="4.11">blew the out of Admiral Richard</text>
  <text start="2086.54" dur="5.19">Byrd Admiral Richard Byrd had to retreat</text>
  <text start="2089.12" dur="4.92">he ended up retreating to South America</text>
  <text start="2091.73" dur="4.32">and what&amp;#39;s interesting is that he gave</text>
  <text start="2094.04" dur="3.72">one interview before he got back to</text>
  <text start="2096.05" dur="3.24">America once he got back to America he</text>
  <text start="2097.76" dur="3.6">was sworn to secrecy they told him to</text>
  <text start="2099.29" dur="4.23">shut up but he gave one interview for a</text>
  <text start="2101.36" dur="4.35">Chilean newspaper before he go back to</text>
  <text start="2103.52" dur="4.71">America and in that interview he said</text>
  <text start="2105.71" dur="4.53">that the enemy has amazing craft that</text>
  <text start="2108.23" dur="3.87">can fly from pole to pole at an amazing</text>
  <text start="2110.24" dur="4.2">speed kind of paraphrasing there but</text>
  <text start="2112.1" dur="4.17">essentially he was saying that he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2114.44" dur="3.36">even like poor bird he had no idea what</text>
  <text start="2116.27" dur="3.27">he was getting into and then he got</text>
  <text start="2117.8" dur="3.57">attacked by these giant flying saucers</text>
  <text start="2119.54" dur="4.89">and themed weapons what is a little</text>
  <text start="2121.37" dur="6.44">aircraft with a gun gonna do to that</text>
  <text start="2124.43" dur="6.33">absolutely nothing so operation Highjump</text>
  <text start="2127.81" dur="5.59">basically the US Navy figured out what</text>
  <text start="2130.76" dur="7.77">the underground Germans were capable of</text>
  <text start="2133.4" dur="8.58">and after 1947 you see after Opera</text>
  <text start="2138.53" dur="6.36">hyejeong this is when we get into the</text>
  <text start="2141.98" dur="4.53">late 40s in the early 1950s now I mean</text>
  <text start="2144.89" dur="3.78">you and I weren&amp;#39;t around back then but</text>
  <text start="2146.51" dur="6">what happened in the 50s was that there</text>
  <text start="2148.67" dur="7.08">was a huge swath of UFO sightings across</text>
  <text start="2152.51" dur="5.88">America a bunch of them I mean you can</text>
  <text start="2155.75" dur="7.05">look this up there&amp;#39;s so many that began</text>
  <text start="2158.39" dur="5.97">happening and in the 50s the United</text>
  <text start="2162.8" dur="3.15">States Air Force they kind of played it</text>
  <text start="2164.36" dur="3.72">off they were like oh you know it must</text>
  <text start="2165.95" dur="5.91">be swamp gas or weather balloons or</text>
  <text start="2168.08" dur="5.58">something like that you know but what</text>
  <text start="2171.86" dur="3.66">they actually were were German flyovers</text>
  <text start="2173.66" dur="3.69">so the Germans were flying their craft</text>
  <text start="2175.52" dur="4.55">over America it was a show of force</text>
  <text start="2177.35" dur="5.55">essentially Eisenhower was in office</text>
  <text start="2180.07" dur="4.51">Eisenhower was dealing with the corrupt</text>
  <text start="2182.9" dur="4.14">deep state elements that were trying to</text>
  <text start="2184.58" dur="4.62">infiltrate America you know because of</text>
  <text start="2187.04" dur="4.2">course the deep state was they funded</text>
  <text start="2189.2" dur="4.17">both sides of World War two but the</text>
  <text start="2191.24" dur="4.47">Americans still had a lot more Patriots</text>
  <text start="2193.37" dur="7.14">they had a lot more good people that</text>
  <text start="2195.71" dur="7.59">wanted freedom up until you know still</text>
  <text start="2200.51" dur="4.08">are still do but what I&amp;#39;m saying here is</text>
  <text start="2203.3" dur="5.61">that the Americans weren&amp;#39;t as</text>
  <text start="2204.59" dur="6.63">infiltrated as the Nazis were so once</text>
  <text start="2208.91" dur="6.57">the Germans began flying their craft</text>
  <text start="2211.22" dur="6.84">over America and they essentially forced</text>
  <text start="2215.48" dur="7.25">Eisenhower into a specific agreement so</text>
  <text start="2218.06" dur="7.38">they strong-armed Eisenhower into a</text>
  <text start="2222.73" dur="4.93">agreement with the Nazis this is when</text>
  <text start="2225.44" dur="3.35">Operation Paperclip really started</text>
  <text start="2227.66" dur="3.78">getting into full swing</text>
  <text start="2228.79" dur="5.23">you know they the Americans started</text>
  <text start="2231.44" dur="6.87">letting thousands of Nazi scientists and</text>
  <text start="2234.02" dur="6.03">researchers into the country here into</text>
  <text start="2238.31" dur="3.48">the medical systems into the media</text>
  <text start="2240.05" dur="3.81">systems into the intelligence apparatus</text>
  <text start="2241.79" dur="6.92">into the aerospace programs I mean it</text>
  <text start="2243.86" dur="4.85">was truly full spectrum dominance and</text>
  <text start="2249.1" dur="5.17">then that that basically just</text>
  <text start="2251.96" dur="5.24">consolidated deep state power in America</text>
  <text start="2254.27" dur="5.7">you know Eisenhower couldn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="2257.2" dur="4.45">John F Kennedy after him tried to do</text>
  <text start="2259.97" dur="3.48">something he tried to do something about</text>
  <text start="2261.65" dur="5.16">the federal reserve with an executive</text>
  <text start="2263.45" dur="6.78">order 10 days before his death he sent a</text>
  <text start="2266.81" dur="5.37">memorandum one to NASA one to the CIA</text>
  <text start="2270.23" dur="4.92">basically trying to get access to</text>
  <text start="2272.18" dur="7.83">black projects and John F Kennedy was</text>
  <text start="2275.15" dur="6.75">then assassinated in Dallas so there was</text>
  <text start="2280.01" dur="4.14">this effort there was this white hat</text>
  <text start="2281.9" dur="5.31">effort in the 50s and 60s to prevent</text>
  <text start="2284.15" dur="4.02">that infiltration but the deep state</text>
  <text start="2287.21" dur="3.18">they won</text>
  <text start="2288.17" dur="3.78">you know they won they began</text>
  <text start="2290.39" dur="3.57">infiltrating into the CIA</text>
  <text start="2291.95" dur="3.84">they began infiltrating into the</text>
  <text start="2293.96" dur="3.149">airforce and then all the other systems</text>
  <text start="2295.79" dur="3.48">like we mentioned but at least in</text>
  <text start="2297.109" dur="5.361">regards to the black projects in the</text>
  <text start="2299.27" dur="5.43">secret space programs they really</text>
  <text start="2302.47" dur="6.73">infiltrated the organizations that had</text>
  <text start="2304.7" dur="6.78">control over those so CIA Air Force they</text>
  <text start="2309.2" dur="6.149">a lot of these Nazi scientists and</text>
  <text start="2311.48" dur="8.19">researchers went into the aerospace</text>
  <text start="2315.349" dur="7.47">corporations Lockheed and someone into</text>
  <text start="2319.67" dur="6.659">Douglas and others at the time so then</text>
  <text start="2322.819" dur="6.451">throughout the you know 60s 70s 80s we</text>
  <text start="2326.329" dur="5.911">see on one hand we get a smokescreen</text>
  <text start="2329.27" dur="5.579">that smokescreen is NASA NASA&amp;#39;s built up</text>
  <text start="2332.24" dur="4.17">oh this is the most advanced science</text>
  <text start="2334.849" dur="3.781">exploration we have we need to go to the</text>
  <text start="2336.41" dur="4.23">moon with it etc etc but on the</text>
  <text start="2338.63" dur="6.06">subsurface you know what they don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="2340.64" dur="5.699">us is that a lot of this money was being</text>
  <text start="2344.69" dur="5.94">funneled through the Department of</text>
  <text start="2346.339" dur="6.24">Defense through the military basically</text>
  <text start="2350.63" dur="4.189">swiped out of the military and it was</text>
  <text start="2352.579" dur="6.181">taken into a lot of these quasi</text>
  <text start="2354.819" dur="8.111">government corporate black projects in</text>
  <text start="2358.76" dur="5.309">the 1980s there was a whistleblower for</text>
  <text start="2362.93" dur="4.02">lack of a better term we could call him</text>
  <text start="2364.069" dur="4.05">his name was Franklin Spinney and he</text>
  <text start="2366.95" dur="3.899">released what was called the Spinney</text>
  <text start="2368.119" dur="5.281">report and it gained some public</text>
  <text start="2370.849" dur="5.281">notoriety hit the mainstream news he was</text>
  <text start="2373.4" dur="4.98">basically detailing how much waste it</text>
  <text start="2376.13" dur="5.669">happens in the Pentagon how much money</text>
  <text start="2378.38" dur="5.88">gets unaccounted for and in the 1980s it</text>
  <text start="2381.799" dur="4.141">might have been in the billions but fast</text>
  <text start="2384.26" dur="3.359">forward to the to thousands of course</text>
  <text start="2385.94" dur="4.44">you heard Donald Rumsfeld the day before</text>
  <text start="2387.619" dur="5.851">9/11 2.3 trillion unaccounted for from</text>
  <text start="2390.38" dur="5.31">the Pentagon next day 9/11 happens yeah</text>
  <text start="2393.47" dur="5.609">I saw that I roll next day 9/11 happens</text>
  <text start="2395.69" dur="7.26">we all forget about that and then that</text>
  <text start="2399.079" dur="5.641">was 2001 2015 the Inspector General&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2402.95" dur="3.18">Office so funny enough the Inspector</text>

  <text start="2429.019" dur="5.701">but Specter general report 2015 six</text>
  <text start="2432.23" dur="6.72">point five trillion and then just this</text>
  <text start="2434.72" dur="7.98">last year 2017 there&amp;#39;s a few researchers</text>
  <text start="2438.95" dur="8.46">out there some citizen journalists one</text>

  <text start="2452.72" dur="3.899">initiative with a bunch of post grad</text>
  <text start="2454.88" dur="4.29">students and they found that that number</text>
  <text start="2456.619" dur="5.061">could be up to 20 trillion dollars</text>

  <text start="2466.46" dur="6.42">dots together I mean in the early 1900s</text>
  <text start="2468.89" dur="6.57">when we have scientists when you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="2483.019" dur="4.5">reverse engineer this stuff they have</text>
  <text start="2484.579" dur="4.53">these Sciences they began getting this</text>
  <text start="2487.519" dur="3.151">science and technology that just blows</text>
  <text start="2489.109" dur="4.771">their minds they realize that they need</text>
  <text start="2490.67" dur="5.159">to keep it secret so they start you know</text>
  <text start="2493.88" dur="4.59">killing off inventors or paying them off</text>
  <text start="2495.829" dur="5.371">or suppressing in any which way they can</text>
  <text start="2498.47" dur="4.95">anybody working on this stuff so this</text>
  <text start="2501.2" dur="5.639">technology gets suppressed gets funneled</text>
  <text start="2503.42" dur="5.52">into black projects throughout the 60s</text>
  <text start="2506.839" dur="6.331">70s 80s they developed the heck out of</text>
  <text start="2508.94" dur="7.349">it I mean we can reference stay secrets</text>
  <text start="2513.17" dur="5.82">Navy Space Program excuse me secret Navy</text>
  <text start="2516.289" dur="4.111">space program called solar warden solar</text>
  <text start="2518.99" dur="5.7">warden was said to be operational in the</text>
  <text start="2520.4" dur="8.189">1980s and involves a whole fleet of</text>
  <text start="2524.69" dur="6">basically electrogravitic spacecraft</text>
  <text start="2528.589" dur="3.42">summer cigar-shaped I believe most of</text>
  <text start="2530.69" dur="3.24">them are cigar-shaped some could be</text>
  <text start="2532.009" dur="4.741">triangle-shaped we were talking about</text>
  <text start="2533.93" dur="5.28">the tr-3b earlier and how some of the</text>
  <text start="2536.75" dur="3.15">science and tech that that uses that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2539.21" dur="3.75">been said to be</text>
  <text start="2539.9" dur="4.679">Air Force a secret Air Force craft they</text>
  <text start="2542.96" dur="3.569">have their hands on some tr3 bees and</text>
  <text start="2544.579" dur="3.78">they keep them in many of these</text>
  <text start="2546.529" dur="3.54">underground installations many of these</text>
  <text start="2548.359" dur="3.541">deep underground military bases that</text>
  <text start="2550.069" dur="3.3">have been created over the past 50 60</text>
  <text start="2551.9" dur="5.55">years around this country they&amp;#39;re what</text>
  <text start="2553.369" dur="6.21">house these craft a secret spacecraft so</text>
  <text start="2557.45" dur="4.02">they don&amp;#39;t have to keep them in orbit or</text>
  <text start="2559.579" dur="2.401">on the earth or in a hangar or anything</text>
  <text start="2561.47" dur="4.47">like that</text>
  <text start="2561.98" dur="5.4">through the ability of these craft to</text>
  <text start="2565.94" dur="3.24">basically dematerialize and</text>
  <text start="2567.38" dur="2.479">rematerialize they can just adore them</text>
  <text start="2569.18" dur="5.399">underground</text>
  <text start="2569.859" dur="6.791">easy out of sight out of mind so yeah</text>
  <text start="2574.579" dur="3.901">that&amp;#39;s that kind of details a lot of how</text>
  <text start="2576.65" dur="3.99">these programs were built out a lot of</text>
  <text start="2578.48" dur="4.5">the money that flows into him you know</text>
  <text start="2580.64" dur="5.31">the when these aerospace companies</text>
  <text start="2582.98" dur="6.03">charge forty thousand dollars for a</text>
  <text start="2585.95" dur="4.29">toilet seat that costs three bucks it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2589.01" dur="4.859">the exact same thing that big pharma</text>
  <text start="2590.24" dur="5.339">does charge $800 for a saline bag that</text>
  <text start="2593.869" dur="3.18">costs two dollars they pocket the rest</text>
  <text start="2595.579" dur="3.45">of the money just classic money</text>
  <text start="2597.049" dur="5.611">laundering so that&amp;#39;s how these aerospace</text>
  <text start="2599.029" dur="6.721">programs were able to get a lot of this</text>
  <text start="2602.66" dur="5.939">money to build out the spacecraft there</text>
  <text start="2605.75" dur="4.68">are multiple programs maybe some run by</text>
  <text start="2608.599" dur="4.381">the Navy maybe some run by the Air Force</text>
  <text start="2610.43" dur="5.659">and the CIA could be some run by the DIA</text>
  <text start="2612.98" dur="6.15">as well so there&amp;#39;s multiple programs</text>
  <text start="2616.089" dur="5.801">they have have some amazing technology a</text>
  <text start="2619.13" dur="4.32">lot of resources to develop them anybody</text>
  <text start="2621.89" dur="3.81">in the public domain that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="2623.45" dur="3.96">researching these same sciences and</text>
  <text start="2625.7" dur="5.31">technologies like zero-point energy or</text>
  <text start="2627.41" dur="5.909">anti-gravity or working with crystals</text>
  <text start="2631.01" dur="4.37">creating energy from crystals or even</text>
  <text start="2633.319" dur="8.311">consciousness research they are</text>
  <text start="2635.38" dur="8.26">suppressed as heck and yeah so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2641.63" dur="3.989">and how they keep them secret - we can</text>
  <text start="2643.64" dur="4.56">touch on that really quick is that and</text>
  <text start="2645.619" dur="6.331">this is important because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2648.2" dur="6.149">called officially is unacknowledged</text>
  <text start="2651.95" dur="3.57">special access programs so many people</text>
  <text start="2654.349" dur="1.95">have heard of the special access</text>
  <text start="2655.52" dur="3.18">programs</text>
  <text start="2656.299" dur="4.411">yeah Hillary Clinton had some sa P stuff</text>
  <text start="2658.7" dur="6.3">on her servers and yeah yeah but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2660.71" dur="6.599">actually a deeper more secret level than</text>
  <text start="2665" dur="4.319">just special access programs and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2667.309" dur="6.591">unacknowledged special access programs</text>
  <text start="2669.319" dur="7.891">so if you are in an us app it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2673.9" dur="5.32">literally that means if anybody asks you</text>
  <text start="2677.21" dur="4.08">about that program could be somebody</text>
  <text start="2679.22" dur="4.5">from Congress could be the President</text>
  <text start="2681.29" dur="3.78">himself you know because some presidents</text>
  <text start="2683.72" dur="4.23">throughout history have been read in a</text>
  <text start="2685.07" dur="5.31">little bit more than others George Bush</text>
  <text start="2687.95" dur="5.37">George Bush Senior George Bush Senior</text>
  <text start="2690.38" dur="5.28">was probably on majestic 12 he probably</text>
  <text start="2693.32" dur="4.02">knows all about this stuff but maybe</text>
  <text start="2695.66" dur="3.24">somebody like Trump they wouldn&amp;#39;t read</text>
  <text start="2697.34" dur="5.01">Trump in you know Trump had to figure it</text>
  <text start="2698.9" dur="4.86">out himself through his his Patriot</text>
  <text start="2702.35" dur="3.3">military friends around him and through</text>
  <text start="2703.76" dur="3.81">his own research but anyway could be the</text>
  <text start="2705.65" dur="3.9">president could be congressman could be</text>
  <text start="2707.57" dur="4.56">anybody they ask you about that program</text>
  <text start="2709.55" dur="3.06">you don&amp;#39;t say a word about it you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2712.13" dur="2.64">say a word</text>
  <text start="2712.61" dur="4.83">that&amp;#39;s unacknowledged special access</text>
  <text start="2714.77" dur="4.47">programs and if you do say a word they</text>
  <text start="2717.44" dur="3.27">will literally put a bullet right there</text>
  <text start="2719.24" dur="3.21">in front of you and say do you want this</text>
  <text start="2720.71" dur="3.69">going into you do you want this going</text>
  <text start="2722.45" dur="4.32">into any of your your friends and family</text>
  <text start="2724.4" dur="4.59">and if you are in one of these o saps</text>
  <text start="2726.77" dur="4.65">you&amp;#39;re basically wiretapped for life and</text>
  <text start="2728.99" dur="5.64">not just you why you&amp;#39;re tapped and you</text>
  <text start="2731.42" dur="4.53">kept track of but there&amp;#39;s two degrees so</text>
  <text start="2734.63" dur="2.52">they won&amp;#39;t they won&amp;#39;t only keep track of</text>
  <text start="2735.95" dur="6.15">you they&amp;#39;ll keep track of who you talk</text>
  <text start="2737.15" dur="6.36">to and if who you talk to begins hearing</text>
  <text start="2742.1" dur="3.99">some things or figuring out some things</text>
  <text start="2743.51" dur="4.53">and they leak it to I mean it&amp;#39;s just we</text>
  <text start="2746.09" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t even want to get into how they</text>
  <text start="2748.04" dur="5.49">keep this stuff secret hmm but they do</text>
  <text start="2751.22" dur="3.78">and they do a very good job with it in a</text>
  <text start="2753.53" dur="1.8">lot of these programs there&amp;#39;s no paper</text>
  <text start="2755" dur="3.21">trail</text>
  <text start="2755.33" dur="5.28">they don&amp;#39;t even deal with with documents</text>
  <text start="2758.21" dur="3.81">that could leak out so they&amp;#39;ve you know</text>
  <text start="2760.61" dur="3.81">a lot of people think the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2762.02" dur="4.56">inept and you know the government is too</text>
  <text start="2764.42" dur="3.9">stupid to do this stuff but we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2766.58" dur="3.71">talking about like lower level</text>
  <text start="2768.32" dur="6.45">bureaucracies here we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="2770.29" dur="7.63">extremely efficient very smart people</text>
  <text start="2774.77" dur="4.83">very sick twisted individuals and you</text>
  <text start="2777.92" dur="3.44">know when we have a sociopath that wants</text>
  <text start="2779.6" dur="4.5">power and they have resources available</text>
  <text start="2781.36" dur="6.22">do it they&amp;#39;re gonna do a damn good job</text>
  <text start="2784.1" dur="4.59">at it a building the stuff out so</text>
  <text start="2787.58" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s definitely a difference between</text>
  <text start="2788.69" dur="3.66">the bureaucratic communist types that</text>
  <text start="2790.91" dur="3.15">are lazy and don&amp;#39;t really want to do</text>
  <text start="2792.35" dur="5.04">anything and the the psychopathic</text>
  <text start="2794.06" dur="5.67">power-hungry you know elite people who</text>
  <text start="2797.39" dur="4.56">are involved in that kind of stuff for</text>
  <text start="2799.73" dur="4.05">shorter absolutely like when we look at</text>
  <text start="2801.95" dur="4.2">queue and when we look a lot of these</text>
  <text start="2803.78" dur="3.69">Patriot white hat elements going on they</text>
  <text start="2806.15" dur="3.12">are damn good at what they do</text>
  <text start="2807.47" dur="3.96">just looking at the queuing operation</text>
  <text start="2809.27" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s like wow you can&amp;#39;t even you know</text>
  <text start="2811.43" dur="7.05">imagine the the depth of it sometimes</text>
  <text start="2814.91" dur="6.57">literally can and take that military</text>
  <text start="2818.48" dur="4.71">intelligence ability CIA&amp;#39;s been doing it</text>
  <text start="2821.48" dur="4.02">for 50 60 years right</text>
  <text start="2823.19" dur="3.87">CIA has you know some of the factions</text>
  <text start="2825.5" dur="3.48">within the CIA had access to these</text>
  <text start="2827.06" dur="5.16">programs so we&amp;#39;re talking about very</text>
  <text start="2828.98" dur="4.5">smart individuals that have been working</text>
  <text start="2832.22" dur="5.37">on these things and building them out</text>
  <text start="2833.48" dur="7.369">for quite a few decades now okay so kind</text>
  <text start="2837.59" dur="5.519">of to bring it back a little bit you</text>
  <text start="2840.849" dur="3.821">know hidden technologies I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="2843.109" dur="3.271">anybody&amp;#39;s gonna have a problem believing</text>
  <text start="2844.67" dur="4.89">and suppressed technologies and stuff</text>
  <text start="2846.38" dur="4.92">but we know from Trump declassifying the</text>
  <text start="2849.56" dur="3.99">JFK files that Hitler made it out alive</text>
  <text start="2851.3" dur="5.309">he didn&amp;#39;t suicide like the official</text>
  <text start="2853.55" dur="5.1">story we know that the the Nazis had a</text>
  <text start="2856.609" dur="5.341">village in Argentina where they set up</text>
  <text start="2858.65" dur="7.68">shop and of course that leads back to</text>
  <text start="2861.95" dur="6.149">Antarctica and Admiral Byrd supposedly</text>
  <text start="2866.33" dur="3.45">had written some journals and stuff and</text>
  <text start="2868.099" dur="5.161">a lot of act that out and then he was</text>
  <text start="2869.78" dur="5.88">talking about how he had flown a mission</text>
  <text start="2873.26" dur="3.9">into like the core of the planet at one</text>
  <text start="2875.66" dur="4.02">of the polls I mean at the the poll</text>
  <text start="2877.16" dur="4.49">there he said he flew like hundreds of</text>
  <text start="2879.68" dur="4.5">miles into the core something like that</text>
  <text start="2881.65" dur="5.34">what do you know about the whole Inner</text>
  <text start="2884.18" dur="6.27">Earth theory and stuff like that right I</text>
  <text start="2886.99" dur="7.349">I had heard about that two birds stating</text>
  <text start="2890.45" dur="6.659">that he had found some way into</text>
  <text start="2894.339" dur="6.01">underground caverns and potentially even</text>
  <text start="2897.109" dur="8.25">met some of the beings that were living</text>
  <text start="2900.349" dur="9.051">in there but as far as my own opinion on</text>
  <text start="2905.359" dur="6.421">all of this I think the earth is</text>
  <text start="2909.4" dur="7.06">definitely spherical definitely rotates</text>
  <text start="2911.78" dur="6.51">but I think there are I think we could</text>
  <text start="2916.46" dur="4.02">call it a honeycomb earth if we want to</text>
  <text start="2918.29" dur="6.93">attach a label to it I think there there</text>
  <text start="2920.48" dur="6.77">could definitely be cavernous rooms you</text>
  <text start="2925.22" dur="5.67">know cavern systems within the earth</text>
  <text start="2927.25" dur="6.07">naturally that arise there from the the</text>
  <text start="2930.89" dur="4.17">components of it from how the earth</text>
  <text start="2933.32" dur="3.57">operates I don&amp;#39;t think the earth has an</text>
  <text start="2935.06" dur="4.89">iron core like we&amp;#39;re told I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2936.89" dur="4.77">more of a plasma an electric electro</text>
  <text start="2939.95" dur="4.26">plasma and</text>
  <text start="2941.66" dur="6.3">I also think that we have an expanding</text>
  <text start="2944.21" dur="6.72">earth I think the earth as we go through</text>
  <text start="2947.96" dur="5.22">natural cosmic evolution quantum cosmic</text>
  <text start="2950.93" dur="4.109">evolution our son of alls our solar</text>
  <text start="2953.18" dur="4.77">system evolves and I think our earth</text>
  <text start="2955.039" dur="4.891">expands as well because you actually</text>
  <text start="2957.95" dur="5.099">shrink the earth all the continents fit</text>
  <text start="2959.93" dur="4.439">wonderfully on a smaller earth and then</text>
  <text start="2963.049" dur="3.151">when you expand it out that&amp;#39;s how they</text>
  <text start="2964.369" dur="3.72">start growing and when you look at the</text>
  <text start="2966.2" dur="3.839">plate tectonics of our planet there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2968.089" dur="3.091">lot more areas of this planet where the</text>
  <text start="2970.039" dur="5.3">plates are moving apart and breaking</text>
  <text start="2971.18" dur="6.899">then subduction zone subduction zones so</text>
  <text start="2975.339" dur="7.99">that&amp;#39;s at least my idea on the earth</text>
  <text start="2978.079" dur="9.651">itself you know it&amp;#39;s been I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="2983.329" dur="7.111">that there are beings that exist under</text>
  <text start="2987.73" dur="4.66">mountainous areas on our planet whether</text>
  <text start="2990.44" dur="3.919">it&amp;#39;s in the Himalayas or it&amp;#39;s on the</text>
  <text start="2992.39" dur="7.35">west coast of the United States here</text>
  <text start="2994.359" dur="9.01">there could be underground societies if</text>
  <text start="2999.74" dur="5.52">you will that exists there so you know</text>
  <text start="3003.369" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s not something I&amp;#39;m too familiar with</text>
  <text start="3005.26" dur="6.029">I just have a I hear things I try to</text>
  <text start="3009.369" dur="4.891">connect the dots and see what might be</text>
  <text start="3011.289" dur="4.471">possible and makes sense to me I I was</text>
  <text start="3014.26" dur="4.769">obsessed with this for a while and I did</text>
  <text start="3015.76" dur="4.589">a lot of diving into this because it</text>
  <text start="3019.029" dur="2.731">kind of went back to the Book of Enoch</text>
  <text start="3020.349" dur="4.651">the Giants and all of that ancient</text>
  <text start="3021.76" dur="4.26">history stuff first of all if they told</text>
  <text start="3025" dur="2.73">me not to look at it or if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3026.02" dur="2.94">suppressed I have to know so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3027.73" dur="4.799">that&amp;#39;s my personality</text>
  <text start="3028.96" dur="6.149">yeah and when when the Admiral Byrd</text>
  <text start="3032.529" dur="5.191">stuff came in I mean this is a respected</text>
  <text start="3035.109" dur="5.071">high-level spoke to presidents military</text>
  <text start="3037.72" dur="4.829">figure not Pro many people that said</text>
  <text start="3040.18" dur="4.74">they knew him said that he was not prone</text>
  <text start="3042.549" dur="3.99">to exaggerations or things like that I</text>
  <text start="3044.92" dur="4.379">mean even the way he wrote his journal</text>
  <text start="3046.539" dur="6.871">was very factual just point by point</text>
  <text start="3049.299" dur="6.391">kind of bullet points he tells a story</text>
  <text start="3053.41" dur="4.76">of having gone into the planet met with</text>
  <text start="3055.69" dur="5.46">giants that were friendly and peaceful</text>
  <text start="3058.17" dur="5.859">kind of goes back to the whole mythology</text>
  <text start="3061.15" dur="7.83">of Agatha or or the biblical Sheol or</text>
  <text start="3064.029" dur="7.711">whatever underground kingdoms my</text>
  <text start="3068.98" dur="4.74">interest here is like most of these</text>
  <text start="3071.74" dur="3.79">giants seem to be evil like to eat</text>
  <text start="3073.72" dur="5.89">people blood sacrifice</text>
  <text start="3075.53" dur="5.43">that these guys seem to be good you know</text>
  <text start="3079.61" dur="2.82">I want to reconcile this I want to</text>
  <text start="3080.96" dur="3">figure out what&amp;#39;s going on I want to see</text>
  <text start="3082.43" dur="4.05">if they&amp;#39;re still alive like if they</text>
  <text start="3083.96" dur="5.67">exist at all I&amp;#39;ve got this idea I want</text>
  <text start="3086.48" dur="5.22">to send like a fleet of drones to all of</text>
  <text start="3089.63" dur="4.02">these places and then a little GoPro</text>
  <text start="3091.7" dur="3.84">drones you know and just they can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="3093.65" dur="3.24">them all before we find the truth hey</text>
  <text start="3095.54" dur="2.43">those things only have like a five-mile</text>
  <text start="3096.89" dur="2.61">range so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to get pretty</text>
  <text start="3097.97" dur="3.9">close though we&amp;#39;re gonna to get better</text>
  <text start="3099.5" dur="3.93">technology like I think I think we could</text>
  <text start="3101.87" dur="4.08">get in a drone before they could shoot</text>
  <text start="3103.43" dur="4.92">them all down maybe there you go yeah</text>
  <text start="3105.95" dur="5.52">and that brings up a good point too</text>
  <text start="3108.35" dur="7.5">because when we get to talking about any</text>
  <text start="3111.47" dur="7.98">sort of civilization or being or entity</text>
  <text start="3115.85" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s not human like us people all this</text>
  <text start="3119.45" dur="2.94">fear enters people&amp;#39;s minds and they</text>
  <text start="3121.19" dur="3.39">don&amp;#39;t know what to think and they get</text>
  <text start="3122.39" dur="4.02">scared and you know are they demons are</text>
  <text start="3124.58" dur="3.9">the interdimensional are they all this</text>
  <text start="3126.41" dur="4.71">all this well my particular belief is</text>
  <text start="3128.48" dur="5.19">that and I&amp;#39;ve heard people in the UFO AG</text>
  <text start="3131.12" dur="4.56">community they say everything outside</text>
  <text start="3133.67" dur="3.66">this planet is evil I&amp;#39;ve heard people</text>
  <text start="3135.68" dur="4.2">say that everything outside this planet</text>
  <text start="3137.33" dur="6.24">is good and I don&amp;#39;t believe either of</text>
  <text start="3139.88" dur="7.26">those things I think there&amp;#39;s a polarity</text>
  <text start="3143.57" dur="5.19">to our whole cosmos not just this planet</text>
  <text start="3147.14" dur="5.48">here so I think there could very well be</text>
  <text start="3148.76" dur="6.03">both what we could call good and bad or</text>
  <text start="3152.62" dur="3.79">for more of a technical term we could</text>
  <text start="3154.79" dur="4.17">call that service to others or service</text>
  <text start="3156.41" dur="5.01">to self beings outside of this planet</text>
  <text start="3158.96" dur="4.74">and under this planet and on this planet</text>
  <text start="3161.42" dur="5.7">you know it&amp;#39;s not good and bad isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3163.7" dur="5.55">just relegated to us here I think any</text>
  <text start="3167.12" dur="6.03">beings out there could be great they</text>
  <text start="3169.25" dur="6.9">could be not so great and your you know</text>
  <text start="3173.15" dur="5.4">your interaction with them is really</text>
  <text start="3176.15" dur="5.45">your intentions I should say the energy</text>
  <text start="3178.55" dur="5.55">that you output really determines what</text>
  <text start="3181.6" dur="4.9">it&amp;#39;s gonna come your way cuz I&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="3184.1" dur="5.01">for instance I&amp;#39;ve gone to hot spots I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3186.5" dur="4.86">gone to ranches where see UFOs in the</text>
  <text start="3189.11" dur="4.47">sky craft appear there they power up</text>
  <text start="3191.36" dur="4.29">they go away it becomes this kind of</text>
  <text start="3193.58" dur="3.84">intelligent communication between the</text>
  <text start="3195.65" dur="3.66">two you can take your laser pointer out</text>
  <text start="3197.42" dur="7.38">there and almost make them power up you</text>
  <text start="3199.31" dur="8.31">know and in that instance what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="3204.8" dur="4.42">intention that the group has at that</text>
  <text start="3207.62" dur="3.28">particular</text>
  <text start="3209.22" dur="4.08">answer at that space it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="3210.9" dur="5.25">positive one it&amp;#39;s just being there to</text>
  <text start="3213.3" dur="3.66">learn in a very humble manner to see</text>
  <text start="3216.15" dur="2.699">something in the sky</text>
  <text start="3216.96" dur="3.36">now there&amp;#39;s other ranches that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3218.849" dur="5.341">never been to and I&amp;#39;m not ever gonna go</text>
  <text start="3220.32" dur="5.88">to because these particular places it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3224.19" dur="3.78">been said that shadow beings or demonic</text>
  <text start="3226.2" dur="5.909">figures will appear there you just get</text>
  <text start="3227.97" dur="7.2">you hear very bad stuff okay so if you</text>
  <text start="3232.109" dur="7.161">go into this with the mindset of fear</text>
  <text start="3235.17" dur="6.57">that&amp;#39;s exactly what the</text>
  <text start="3239.27" dur="5.62">multi-dimensional entities these are</text>
  <text start="3241.74" dur="7.65">conic entities feed off of the one that</text>
  <text start="3244.89" dur="6.5">literally the entities that have control</text>
  <text start="3249.39" dur="3.9">over our planet they feed off our fear</text>
  <text start="3251.39" dur="4.87">basically is what I&amp;#39;m pointing out here</text>
  <text start="3253.29" dur="5.4">and if you have fear when delving into</text>
  <text start="3256.26" dur="4.05">this research or going into any sort of</text>
  <text start="3258.69" dur="6.51">experience it&amp;#39;s exactly what they feed</text>
  <text start="3260.31" dur="7.2">off of and to not have any sort of</text>
  <text start="3265.2" dur="6.21">negative speery instill a go into it</text>
  <text start="3267.51" dur="6.45">with the positive intention an intention</text>
  <text start="3271.41" dur="4.5">of light I often hear that if somebody</text>
  <text start="3273.96" dur="4.409">does get attacked by some sort of shadow</text>
  <text start="3275.91" dur="5.97">being or a chronic entity just by saying</text>
  <text start="3278.369" dur="6.331">the name of Jesus Christ makes it makes</text>
  <text start="3281.88" dur="5.52">it go away you know and you gonna have</text>
  <text start="3284.7" dur="5.25">to say Jesus name if that&amp;#39;s your belief</text>
  <text start="3287.4" dur="4.35">system great but you could basically</text>
  <text start="3289.95" dur="6.3">just have any sort of positive intention</text>
  <text start="3291.75" dur="7.49">just visualize a love it visualize love</text>
  <text start="3296.25" dur="6.359">and light in that moment and you can</text>
  <text start="3299.24" dur="4.96">break that connection to that parasitic</text>
  <text start="3302.609" dur="3.631">entity like spring Bob Marley and they</text>
  <text start="3304.2" dur="5.22">would disappear yeah Bob Marley light up</text>
  <text start="3306.24" dur="4.92">a big fat one and she&amp;#39;s gone yes well</text>
  <text start="3309.42" dur="3.3">that&amp;#39;s interesting to see I you know I</text>
  <text start="3311.16" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t know about all these shadow beings</text>
  <text start="3312.72" dur="4.86">and heard that one but I want I&amp;#39;m the</text>
  <text start="3315.99" dur="2.76">kind of person that wants to expose it</text>
  <text start="3317.58" dur="3.779">if it&amp;#39;s there I don&amp;#39;t want to just talk</text>
  <text start="3318.75" dur="4.77">about it I want to you know mountain</text>
  <text start="3321.359" dur="4.201">expedition expose it let the world know</text>
  <text start="3323.52" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s real or not and if they are real</text>
  <text start="3325.56" dur="3.539">and if they are evil let&amp;#39;s just dig them</text>
  <text start="3327.03" dur="4.92">out and destroy them all yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3329.099" dur="4.051">that&amp;#39;s kind of my personality on it it</text>
  <text start="3331.95" dur="2.22">kind of makes me what you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="3333.15" dur="2.37">about there kind of makes me think of</text>
  <text start="3334.17" dur="3.419">CERN and what they&amp;#39;re doing and they</text>
  <text start="3335.52" dur="4.14">seem to be trying to contact extra</text>
  <text start="3337.589" dur="3.451">dimensional entities and open portals or</text>
  <text start="3339.66" dur="2.77">whatever I don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="3341.04" dur="3.19">exactly but yeah</text>
  <text start="3342.43" dur="4.32">I haven&amp;#39;t dig too much in discern</text>
  <text start="3344.23" dur="5.19">because it just doesn&amp;#39;t like it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3346.75" dur="4.26">excite me maybe they&amp;#39;re doing some weird</text>
  <text start="3349.42" dur="2.909">stuff I don&amp;#39;t know it still seems like</text>
  <text start="3351.01" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re messing around with particle</text>
  <text start="3352.329" dur="4.201">physics they&amp;#39;re not actually messing</text>
  <text start="3354.25" dur="3.96">around with electric universe physics or</text>
  <text start="3356.53" dur="3.27">the occult stuff that I want to learn so</text>
  <text start="3358.21" dur="2.099">that&amp;#39;s why CERN I&amp;#39;m not even worried</text>
  <text start="3359.8" dur="2.85">about</text>
  <text start="3360.309" dur="6.06">I think CERN is this big money grab</text>
  <text start="3362.65" dur="5.429">really I think dark occult stuff too</text>
  <text start="3366.369" dur="3.931">yeah a lot of dark occult stuff around</text>
  <text start="3368.079" dur="4.5">it and there&amp;#39;s still like the physics</text>
  <text start="3370.3" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re messing with it&amp;#39;s still the</text>
  <text start="3372.579" dur="6.361">mainstream style stuff I&amp;#39;m much more</text>
  <text start="3375.91" dur="4.949">interested in the electric universe or</text>
  <text start="3378.94" dur="4.26">what Walter Russell and Nikola Tesla had</text>
  <text start="3380.859" dur="4.311">to say or the reciprocal systems theory</text>
  <text start="3383.2" dur="6.27">of GUI B Larsen you know these actual</text>
  <text start="3385.17" dur="5.919">esoteric physics that explain what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3389.47" dur="3.599">going on in these secret space programs</text>
  <text start="3391.089" dur="3.75">what&amp;#39;s going on at CERN that&amp;#39;s all in</text>
  <text start="3393.069" dur="4.77">public view anything in public view</text>
  <text start="3394.839" dur="4.051">isn&amp;#39;t gonna be the hardcore stuff you</text>
  <text start="3397.839" dur="4.201">know fair enough</text>
  <text start="3398.89" dur="5.31">okay space force space force yes good</text>
  <text start="3402.04" dur="4.14">glad you asked me about that so I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="3404.2" dur="4.109">just give it to you straight up I think</text>
  <text start="3406.18" dur="4.59">the space force you know like I</text>
  <text start="3408.309" dur="5.55">mentioned earlier some presidents are</text>
  <text start="3410.77" dur="5.48">read into this stuff some aren&amp;#39;t Donald</text>
  <text start="3413.859" dur="6.99">Trump obviously a very smart individual</text>
  <text start="3416.25" dur="6.339">he&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s doing seems very much to</text>
  <text start="3420.849" dur="4.591">be for our freedom for truth and</text>
  <text start="3422.589" dur="5.52">transparency and he&amp;#39;s got a load of</text>
  <text start="3425.44" dur="5.609">military help around him a lot of marine</text>
  <text start="3428.109" dur="6.171">generals Navy especially they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="3431.049" dur="5.81">know some things Michael Flynn was his</text>
  <text start="3434.28" dur="4.87">national security adviser for a month</text>
  <text start="3436.859" dur="5.141">Michael Flynn used to be the head of the</text>
  <text start="3439.15" dur="5.28">DIA and the second-in-command of the CIA</text>
  <text start="3442" dur="5.579">I would imagine the Flint probably knows</text>
  <text start="3444.43" dur="5.85">some things so Donald Trump he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3447.579" dur="5.401">probably heard some things and also on</text>
  <text start="3450.28" dur="4.5">that note who was the man that took</text>
  <text start="3452.98" dur="5.28">Nikola Tesla papers upon his death in</text>
  <text start="3454.78" dur="7.62">New York in 1943 royal to Uncle John G</text>
  <text start="3458.26" dur="6.809">Trump totally so just by educated</text>
  <text start="3462.4" dur="4.649">estimation here we can say that okay</text>
  <text start="3465.069" dur="4.921">Donald Trump might not have access into</text>
  <text start="3467.049" dur="4.741">these programs but he knows and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3469.99" dur="3.359">trying to figure them out now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3471.79" dur="3.569">where the space force comes into play</text>
  <text start="3473.349" dur="2.611">because by creating this six branch to</text>
  <text start="3475.359" dur="2.941">the military</text>
  <text start="3475.96" dur="5.61">by creating a branch of the military</text>
  <text start="3478.3" dur="5.88">that&amp;#39;s gonna gain access to these space</text>
  <text start="3481.57" dur="5.13">programs to Space Command and start</text>
  <text start="3484.18" dur="6.86">getting a lot of the operations sabzi</text>
  <text start="3486.7" dur="6.899">mintue it well that&amp;#39;s how this alliance</text>
  <text start="3491.04" dur="4.42">could gain access to these speak these</text>
  <text start="3493.599" dur="4.681">secret space programs and then start</text>
  <text start="3495.46" dur="5.58">disclosing them and the very important</text>
  <text start="3498.28" dur="8.85">thing about the space force you see is</text>
  <text start="3501.04" dur="8.52">that it completely undermines the</text>
  <text start="3507.13" dur="4.29">partial disclosure that the deep state</text>
  <text start="3509.56" dur="4.65">has wanted to do for a few years now</text>
  <text start="3511.42" dur="4.62">because you&amp;#39;ll notice in John Podesta</text>
  <text start="3514.21" dur="3.87">emails mm-hmm he was talking about</text>
  <text start="3516.04" dur="4.799">zero-point energy he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>

  <text start="3535.18" dur="6.71">these UFO disclosures from DoD programs</text>
  <text start="3538.15" dur="6.24">and why is John Podesta and Harry Reid</text>
  <text start="3541.89" dur="4.24">involved and why was Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="3544.39" dur="4.199">seen walking with Lawrence Rockefeller</text>
  <text start="3546.13" dur="6.11">in the early 90s with a book on aliens</text>
  <text start="3548.589" dur="7.561">in her hand you know so the deep State</text>
  <text start="3552.24" dur="6.76">they&amp;#39;ve wanted they want to disclose ETS</text>
  <text start="3556.15" dur="5.01">and UFOs but they don&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s a limited</text>
  <text start="3559" dur="4.98">hangout they only want to give us a</text>
  <text start="3561.16" dur="5.97">piece of the puzzle so that we get wowed</text>
  <text start="3563.98" dur="4.59">and distracted away from the rest of the</text>
  <text start="3567.13" dur="3.9">dark stuff that they want to brush under</text>
  <text start="3568.57" dur="3.18">the rug you see so it&amp;#39;s kind of like a</text>

  <text start="3586.99" dur="5.06">either Russia or China in America I</text>
  <text start="3588.79" dur="6.39">would think that this war would involve</text>
  <text start="3592.05" dur="5.71">secret space program technology right</text>
  <text start="3595.18" dur="4.85">because they were trying to deep state</text>
  <text start="3597.76" dur="4.65">had their hands and some of it I think</text>
  <text start="3600.03" dur="4.72">with Trump getting into the picture</text>
  <text start="3602.41" dur="4.8">completely annihilated the deep states</text>
  <text start="3604.75" dur="4.38">hopes and dreams their cue came onto the</text>
  <text start="3607.21" dur="4.649">scene to start warning the</text>
  <text start="3609.13" dur="4.709">look giving us intelligence</text>
  <text start="3611.859" dur="4.47">dissemination effort and then the space</text>
  <text start="3613.839" dur="5.52">force is created to completely undermine</text>
  <text start="3616.329" dur="5.19">this partial disclosure limited hangout</text>
  <text start="3619.359" dur="5.521">the deep state has wanted to play with</text>
  <text start="3621.519" dur="5.79">some of their secret space programs so</text>
  <text start="3624.88" dur="4.77">for instance the you know we have the</text>
  <text start="3627.309" dur="4.74">NSA and the CIA no such agency versus</text>
  <text start="3629.65" dur="5.459">the clowns in America right now mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="3632.049" dur="5.49">yeah a many factions within that</text>
  <text start="3635.109" dur="4.891">three-letter agency have access to some</text>
  <text start="3637.539" dur="4.651">of these secret space programs so I mean</text>
  <text start="3640" dur="7.799">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just kind of this that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="3642.19" dur="8.7">game I&amp;#39;m seeing play out is that Q Trump</text>
  <text start="3647.799" dur="5.07">and the space force all of that are just</text>
  <text start="3650.89" dur="4.05">completely I mean they&amp;#39;re not only</text>
  <text start="3652.869" dur="5.16">trying to get rid of the human</text>
  <text start="3654.94" dur="6.56">trafficking and all of the human</text>
  <text start="3658.029" dur="6.99">sacrifice that goes on that feeds these</text>
  <text start="3661.5" dur="8.47">sick are chronic entities but they also</text>
  <text start="3665.019" dur="8.52">are covering up any sort of way that the</text>
  <text start="3669.97" dur="7.68">deep state could fake us fake us with a</text>
  <text start="3673.539" dur="6.24">disclosure so tactics and strategies are</text>
  <text start="3677.65" dur="3.859">something that I enjoy thinking about</text>
  <text start="3679.779" dur="4.5">actually it&amp;#39;s kind of a fun thing for me</text>
  <text start="3681.509" dur="4.181">so you know I&amp;#39;ve heard people say that</text>
  <text start="3684.279" dur="3">and I want to get your opinion on this</text>
  <text start="3685.69" dur="3.78">in a second like there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3687.279" dur="3.631">already a battle or a war in space or at</text>
  <text start="3689.47" dur="2.49">least an arms race and that kind of</text>
  <text start="3690.91" dur="3.629">makes sense with what we&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="3691.96" dur="7.53">space force versus Russian space weapons</text>
  <text start="3694.539" dur="6.81">everything else you know if they if the</text>
  <text start="3699.49" dur="4.379">bad guys have access to this level of</text>
  <text start="3701.349" dur="5.101">technology and power why are they not</text>
  <text start="3703.869" dur="5.9">using it to stop Trump why have they not</text>
  <text start="3706.45" dur="6.389">just flipped a switch and killed him</text>
  <text start="3709.769" dur="6.971">very good question there and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="3712.839" dur="5.881">put a few speculations out so the bad</text>
  <text start="3716.74" dur="4.23">guys could have access to this</text>
  <text start="3718.72" dur="7.649">technology but the good guys we could</text>
  <text start="3720.97" dur="6.99">say could as well and the Navy has been</text>
  <text start="3726.369" dur="6.111">known to have some of their own secret</text>
  <text start="3727.96" dur="8.129">space programs and some of the Navy</text>
  <text start="3732.48" dur="6.49">factions have been it seems they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="3736.089" dur="5.071">trying to push more of a full disclosure</text>
  <text start="3738.97" dur="3.46">than others and then also looking at</text>
  <text start="3741.16" dur="3.48">Donald Trump&amp;#39;s connections</text>
  <text start="3742.43" dur="8.55">to the marine generals around him and</text>
  <text start="3744.64" dur="9.13">Navy Admirals around him etc I think the</text>
  <text start="3750.98" dur="4.079">white hats the Alliance have access to</text>
  <text start="3753.77" dur="5.24">some of these secret space program</text>
  <text start="3755.059" dur="6.51">technologies - I think a lot of the</text>
  <text start="3759.01" dur="5.62">technology that the deep state had is</text>
  <text start="3761.569" dur="4.74">getting neutralized as well and I think</text>
  <text start="3764.63" dur="3.54">that this has been going on for years</text>
  <text start="3766.309" dur="4.131">even before Cuba&amp;#39;s on this thing on the</text>
  <text start="3768.17" dur="7.32">scene I think this has been going on for</text>
  <text start="3770.44" dur="8.35">quite a while and not only that but I do</text>
  <text start="3775.49" dur="5.76">believe that there are other forces in</text>
  <text start="3778.79" dur="4.529">play that are preventing things like</text>
  <text start="3781.25" dur="4.38">this from going on you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="3783.319" dur="4.02">people are scared about the fake alien</text>
  <text start="3785.63" dur="3.03">invasion thing that collars gonna be a</text>
  <text start="3787.339" dur="3.691">thick alien invasion has to be the last</text>
  <text start="3788.66" dur="5.61">thing the deep state tries to play well</text>
  <text start="3791.03" dur="6.27">I personally believe that that is a</text>
  <text start="3794.27" dur="4.98">PSYOP about a PSYOP I don&amp;#39;t think any</text>
  <text start="3797.3" dur="5.46">sort of fake alien invasion is possible</text>
  <text start="3799.25" dur="8.97">I think if the deep state even tried to</text>
  <text start="3802.76" dur="6.89">fake any sort of alien invasion or craft</text>
  <text start="3808.22" dur="7.77">in the sky or anything like that</text>
  <text start="3809.65" dur="8.14">basically that opens the the freewill</text>
  <text start="3815.99" dur="2.609">doors we could say familiar with the</text>
  <text start="3817.79" dur="3.96">prime directive</text>
  <text start="3818.599" dur="4.411">were you ever a Trekkie yeah not to</text>
  <text start="3821.75" dur="3.75">interfere with the development of</text>
  <text start="3823.01" dur="3.69">species and you know exactly visit</text>
  <text start="3825.5" dur="3.78">another planet and you can&amp;#39;t mess with</text>
  <text start="3826.7" dur="6.21">their evolution or technology that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3829.28" dur="5.94">basically why we haven&amp;#39;t seen millions</text>
  <text start="3832.91" dur="3.899">of ET craft deep clothes themselves and</text>
  <text start="3835.22" dur="3.48">our skies already is because of the</text>
  <text start="3836.809" dur="3.81">prime directive the idea of free will</text>
  <text start="3838.7" dur="4.139">they have to let us figure own crap out</text>
  <text start="3840.619" dur="5.25">and initiate contact before they do</text>
  <text start="3842.839" dur="5.341">now if the bad guys at the deep state</text>
  <text start="3845.869" dur="5.311">were to try to do any fake alien</text>
  <text start="3848.18" dur="4.619">invasion boom that&amp;#39;s just gonna oh</text>
  <text start="3851.18" dur="3.57">that&amp;#39;s just gonna nullify the prime</text>
  <text start="3852.799" dur="3.841">directive right there and that&amp;#39;s then</text>
  <text start="3854.75" dur="5.099">gonna allow all of the benevolent</text>
  <text start="3856.64" dur="6.36">species that are watching and waiting to</text>
  <text start="3859.849" dur="4.98">start intervening and stop that from</text>
  <text start="3863" dur="3.15">happening so there&amp;#39;s multiple reasons</text>
  <text start="3864.829" dur="5.641">why I don&amp;#39;t think of fake alien</text>
  <text start="3866.15" dur="6.57">invasions possible I think the anybody</text>
  <text start="3870.47" dur="3.78">that is doing good on this planet right</text>
  <text start="3872.72" dur="3.45">now doing what we could call the great</text>
  <text start="3874.25" dur="6.27">work Capital G capital</text>
  <text start="3876.17" dur="6.87">you they have all sorts of spiritual</text>
  <text start="3880.52" dur="6.299">forces behind them assisting them right</text>
  <text start="3883.04" dur="7.259">now so anything anything anybody tries</text>
  <text start="3886.819" dur="7.49">to do that is self-service that is we</text>
  <text start="3890.299" dur="6.27">call negative or fear of using a path</text>
  <text start="3894.309" dur="3.941">left-handed path yeah left-handed path</text>
  <text start="3896.569" dur="4.921">perfect way to put it anybody on that</text>
  <text start="3898.25" dur="3.839">left-handed path is just they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="3901.49" dur="3.089">gonna succeed</text>
  <text start="3902.089" dur="3.72">you know it&amp;#39;s karma is getting so fast</text>
  <text start="3904.579" dur="3.961">these days it&amp;#39;s just gonna come around</text>
  <text start="3905.809" dur="5.401">and bite him in the ass so you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3908.54" dur="5.279">thinking maybe of the idea of the</text>
  <text start="3911.21" dur="4.5">federation of light versus the what is</text>
  <text start="3913.819" dur="4.921">it Ankara Alliance or something like a</text>
  <text start="3915.71" dur="5.31">bad guy yeah I don&amp;#39;t really associate</text>
  <text start="3918.74" dur="4.619">names to it some people go galactic</text>
  <text start="3921.02" dur="3.63">federal Agri duration of light or this</text>
  <text start="3923.359" dur="2.7">or that and apparently they put out</text>
  <text start="3924.65" dur="3.959">their own YouTube videos and everything</text>
  <text start="3926.059" dur="3.601">so yeah I don&amp;#39;t get caught up with a lot</text>
  <text start="3928.609" dur="4.051">of that stuff it&amp;#39;s kind of two</text>
  <text start="3929.66" dur="5.909">airy-fairy for me but I do believe there</text>
  <text start="3932.66" dur="5.639">are civilizations here watching and</text>
  <text start="3935.569" dur="6.3">waiting you know multiple ones call them</text>
  <text start="3938.299" dur="4.891">what you want I believe there are we</text>
  <text start="3941.869" dur="3.331">were just talking about the Giants the</text>
  <text start="3943.19" dur="5.19">elongated skull people&amp;#39;s there could be</text>
  <text start="3945.2" dur="5.55">other et civilizations that have been</text>
  <text start="3948.38" dur="4.949">working with them as well this gets into</text>
  <text start="3950.75" dur="6.319">the idea of well our reptilian this real</text>
  <text start="3953.329" dur="6.211">maybe maybe not I&amp;#39;ve heard some pretty</text>
  <text start="3957.069" dur="5.711">well sourced individuals say they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="3959.54" dur="5.64">real well-placed people so that leads me</text>
  <text start="3962.78" dur="5.339">to believe that possibly and just</text>
  <text start="3965.18" dur="7.74">logical deduction you know there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3968.119" dur="7.861">I would say that it&amp;#39;s probably a chance</text>
  <text start="3972.92" dur="6.27">that any species out there whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3975.98" dur="5.369">feline avian reptilian humanoid can</text>
  <text start="3979.19" dur="4.8">develop into a self-aware self-conscious</text>
  <text start="3981.349" dur="4.851">being like we are so yeah I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="3983.99" dur="4.859">it&amp;#39;s out of the picture to say that</text>
  <text start="3986.2" dur="4.81">reptilians are real but yeah there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3988.849" dur="4.141">negative negative positive it&amp;#39;s a battle</text>
  <text start="3991.01" dur="5.76">of good and evil right here as it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3992.99" dur="7.95">often said so I was a big Star Trek kid</text>
  <text start="3996.77" dur="6.42">growing up so this is myself a Star Wars</text>
  <text start="4000.94" dur="4.71">Star Trek Stargate everything I was made</text>
  <text start="4003.19" dur="4.35">Stargate so much truth in plain sight</text>
  <text start="4005.65" dur="3.419">right guys you have no idea there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4007.54" dur="1.95">definitely some self-disclosure going on</text>
  <text start="4009.069" dur="2.851">there so</text>
  <text start="4009.49" dur="4.35">with our pyramids and the the gods that</text>
  <text start="4011.92" dur="5.94">really were just and you know monsters</text>
  <text start="4013.84" dur="6.18">didn&amp;#39;t slaves everybody but I saw a</text>
  <text start="4017.86" dur="4.38">logical post a post one time about the</text>
  <text start="4020.02" dur="4.77">logical deductions of alien species if</text>
  <text start="4022.24" dur="4.02">if we were in theory to meet any and it</text>
  <text start="4024.79" dur="3.84">went through like all of the possible</text>
  <text start="4026.26" dur="5.04">things that could happen with us meaning</text>
  <text start="4028.63" dur="4.77">in advanced alien civilization and most</text>
  <text start="4031.3" dur="4.8">of them were really bad like they eat us</text>
  <text start="4033.4" dur="4.14">they take our planet for resources they</text>
  <text start="4036.1" dur="3.45">enslave us</text>
  <text start="4037.54" dur="3.11">they just think of us as ants so they</text>
  <text start="4039.55" dur="3.65">don&amp;#39;t really care what they do us</text>
  <text start="4040.65" dur="5.23">there&amp;#39;s a few good ones at the end but</text>
  <text start="4043.2" dur="4.3">this was kind of in response to the idea</text>
  <text start="4045.88" dur="3.54">that we&amp;#39;re broadcasting things out into</text>
  <text start="4047.5" dur="3.66">space with radio waves and stuff and</text>
  <text start="4049.42" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s probably not a good idea to be</text>
  <text start="4051.16" dur="5.37">bringing attention to us really there is</text>
  <text start="4053.56" dur="6.48">something out there I hope that there is</text>
  <text start="4056.53" dur="5.339">indeed some good beings out there like</text>
  <text start="4060.04" dur="3.66">kind of have our backs on this this</text>
  <text start="4061.869" dur="7.141">whole thing and and they&amp;#39;re preventing</text>
  <text start="4063.7" dur="7.56">sort of an unfair power oh yeah there</text>
  <text start="4069.01" dur="4.77">absolutely is being used and I think</text>
  <text start="4071.26" dur="5.55">I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve seen something like what</text>
  <text start="4073.78" dur="5.1">you&amp;#39;re describing there before and that</text>
  <text start="4076.81" dur="3.9">assumes that these races haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="4078.88" dur="6.36">here for a long time already though you</text>
  <text start="4080.71" dur="6.21">know and like we were talking about the</text>
  <text start="4085.24" dur="4.44">bad guys they&amp;#39;re damn good at what they</text>
  <text start="4086.92" dur="4.439">do they they did a damn good job at</text>
  <text start="4089.68" dur="5.939">setting up the control systems enslaving</text>
  <text start="4091.359" dur="6.301">this planet so I mean if there wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4095.619" dur="2.731">any force of good here we would all be</text>
  <text start="4097.66" dur="2.73">gone by now</text>
  <text start="4098.35" dur="4.44">or we would be you know making pyramids</text>
  <text start="4100.39" dur="3.78">for them or something like that so I</text>
  <text start="4102.79" dur="3.33">totally believe that there is a good</text>
  <text start="4104.17" dur="3.66">force here that&amp;#39;s helping again prime</text>
  <text start="4106.12" dur="4.08">directive they can&amp;#39;t just openly show</text>
  <text start="4107.83" dur="5.85">themselves but they&amp;#39;ve been sending</text>
  <text start="4110.2" dur="6.03">messages they&amp;#39;ve been putting messages</text>
  <text start="4113.68" dur="4.98">and crop circles they&amp;#39;ve been contacting</text>
  <text start="4116.23" dur="5.069">a few people here and there I do know</text>
  <text start="4118.66" dur="5.67">some people that have been contacted</text>
  <text start="4121.299" dur="5.011">they have been downloading people with</text>
  <text start="4124.33" dur="3.179">information you know Nikola Tesla was</text>
  <text start="4126.31" dur="3.27">like I don&amp;#39;t know how the heck I got</text>
  <text start="4127.509" dur="4.951">this information but must have come from</text>
  <text start="4129.58" dur="4.08">the mental power of God Maria or such we</text>
  <text start="4132.46" dur="3.21">were talking about earlier it was</text>
  <text start="4133.66" dur="4.74">channeling the stuff so there&amp;#39;s totally</text>
  <text start="4135.67" dur="4.859">have been a spiritual battle going on</text>
  <text start="4138.4" dur="4.77">right around us that so many people have</text>
  <text start="4140.529" dur="2.821">no idea that these other civilizations</text>
  <text start="4143.17" dur="3.45">are</text>
  <text start="4143.35" dur="3.87">volved in you know and it&amp;#39;s also funny</text>
  <text start="4146.62" dur="2.85">about that</text>
  <text start="4147.22" dur="5.31">idea that we&amp;#39;ve been broadcasting radio</text>
  <text start="4149.47" dur="5.58">waves out there and I even saw this</text>
  <text start="4152.53" dur="5.37">article the other day from a mainstream</text>
  <text start="4155.05" dur="4.32">science publication saying that radio</text>

  <text start="4188.13" dur="4.84">radio waves for communication it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="4191.2" dur="4.89">quantum communication in fact much of</text>
  <text start="4192.97" dur="5.76">their communication is telepathic so you</text>

  <text start="4198.73" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re missing a lot they&amp;#39;re missing a</text>
  <text start="4200.38" dur="6.84">lot with that that theory there okay so</text>
  <text start="4204.04" dur="4.86">recently QED did a Q&amp;amp;A and I know when</text>
  <text start="4207.22" dur="3.15">he got to the alien question you were</text>
  <text start="4208.9" dur="3.39">probably on the edge of your seat like</text>
  <text start="4210.37" dur="3.21">very excited because that dude and it</text>
  <text start="4212.29" dur="4.71">was funny I was just about to give a</text>
  <text start="4213.58" dur="6.36">talk in California to a MUFON group</text>
  <text start="4217" dur="5.61">MUFON the mutual UFO network Consortium</text>
  <text start="4219.94" dur="4.8">and I got these text messages on my</text>
  <text start="4222.61" dur="3.6">phone like hey look at Q oh my god I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4224.74" dur="2.67">like what&amp;#39;s going on and then I saw him</text>
  <text start="4226.21" dur="2.58">yeah I definitely was on the edge of my</text>
  <text start="4227.41" dur="3.9">seat totally yeah</text>
  <text start="4228.79" dur="5.13">so obviously that kind of plays back</text>
  <text start="4231.31" dur="4.26">into all of this he&amp;#39;s he was very subtle</text>
  <text start="4233.92" dur="3.99">about it but he&amp;#39;s kind of saying yeah</text>
  <text start="4235.57" dur="5.55">there is some classified stuff going on</text>
  <text start="4237.91" dur="5.97">here yep are we alone no highest</text>
  <text start="4241.12" dur="4.82">classification but obviously right there</text>
  <text start="4243.88" dur="7.89">it&amp;#39;s always been that way for decades</text>
  <text start="4245.94" dur="9.94">and then it was our moon landings fake</text>
  <text start="4251.77" dur="6.63">no which I also agree with I think that</text>
  <text start="4255.88" dur="4.74">NASA did get to the moon in the Apollo</text>
  <text start="4258.4" dur="3.63">programs I don&amp;#39;t think they really</text>
  <text start="4260.62" dur="3.15">showed us what was on the moon though</text>
  <text start="4262.03" dur="4.05">there have been plenty of photographs of</text>
  <text start="4263.77" dur="4.65">the moon with artificial structures like</text>
  <text start="4266.08" dur="4.47">the videos seem kind of faked videos</text>
  <text start="4268.42" dur="4.35">seem fake yeah I do believe there could</text>
  <text start="4270.55" dur="4.32">have been some fake some videos created</text>
  <text start="4272.77" dur="3.42">some fake ones made to put out there the</text>
  <text start="4274.87" dur="1.979">muddy the water so we might see some</text>
  <text start="4276.19" dur="2.31">real stuff</text>
  <text start="4276.849" dur="3.6">we might see some fake ones from it and</text>
  <text start="4278.5" dur="4.92">it just totally muddies all the waters</text>
  <text start="4280.449" dur="4.801">confuses everybody so I think we did get</text>
  <text start="4283.42" dur="3.569">to the moon I don&amp;#39;t think they told us</text>
  <text start="4285.25" dur="2.19">that when the Apollo astronauts got to</text>
  <text start="4286.989" dur="2.641">the moon</text>
  <text start="4287.44" dur="6.09">there were crafts around them that met</text>
  <text start="4289.63" dur="6.509">them in that crater a insider that</text>
  <text start="4293.53" dur="4.14">recently came forward the past few years</text>
  <text start="4296.139" dur="3.511">he&amp;#39;s passed away now but his name was</text>
  <text start="4297.67" dur="5.819">William Tompkins I got the opportunity</text>
  <text start="4299.65" dur="6.54">to interview him he was a naval insider</text>
  <text start="4303.489" dur="4.201">he was actually the man debriefing those</text>
  <text start="4306.19" dur="2.82">naval spies that were embedded in the</text>
  <text start="4307.69" dur="3.719">German secret space programs in World</text>
  <text start="4309.01" dur="4.56">War two he&amp;#39;s Deaver the guy that</text>
  <text start="4311.409" dur="4.051">debriefed them with couple naval</text>
  <text start="4313.57" dur="6.06">captain&amp;#39;s and a naval Admiral in San</text>
  <text start="4315.46" dur="7.949">Diego but he was able to view the</text>
  <text start="4319.63" dur="7.469">unedited footage raw from Apollo landing</text>
  <text start="4323.409" dur="5.52">on the moon and this was before they</text>
  <text start="4327.099" dur="3.321">were able to kind of sanitize it put it</text>
  <text start="4328.929" dur="4.051">out to the public and he actually</text>
  <text start="4330.42" dur="6.31">according to his testimony he said that</text>
  <text start="4332.98" dur="5.19">he saw craft around the crater that met</text>
  <text start="4336.73" dur="3.96">the Apollo astronauts there and</text>
  <text start="4338.17" dur="3.989">basically told them to you know do your</text>
  <text start="4340.69" dur="2.279">little studies pick up your rocks and</text>
  <text start="4342.159" dur="2.25">never come back</text>
  <text start="4342.969" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s a reason we&amp;#39;ve never been back</text>
  <text start="4344.409" dur="5.94">to the moon and that&amp;#39;s because our moon</text>
  <text start="4346.719" dur="5.821">is inhabited what&amp;#39;s on the back side why</text>
  <text start="4350.349" dur="4.681">does the same side of the moon always</text>
  <text start="4352.54" dur="4.88">face earth right hmm</text>
  <text start="4355.03" dur="4.859">hasn&amp;#39;t NASA gone back is there all very</text>
  <text start="4357.42" dur="4.33">important questions that people often</text>
  <text start="4359.889" dur="4.261">don&amp;#39;t ask but it&amp;#39;s because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4361.75" dur="6.09">there&amp;#39;s things already there you know a</text>
  <text start="4364.15" dur="5.58">lot of things Wow this is gonna be a lot</text>
  <text start="4367.84" dur="3.359">from people to take in yeah</text>
  <text start="4369.73" dur="4.17">oh but anyway getting back onto the</text>
  <text start="4371.199" dur="4.98">queue and then yak you said uh programs</text>
  <text start="4373.9" dur="6.33">exist outside of public domain and that</text>
  <text start="4376.179" dur="6.871">was it and there I mean in what 20 15 20</text>
  <text start="4380.23" dur="7.71">words right there so much was said and</text>
  <text start="4383.05" dur="7.049">so much was also we could save validated</text>
  <text start="4387.94" dur="4.29">in a certain way I was it was a big</text>
  <text start="4390.099" dur="5.31">disclosure because essentially that is</text>
  <text start="4392.23" dur="5.79">that is official disclosure from the</text>
  <text start="4395.409" dur="5.73">government right there QED very</text>
  <text start="4398.02" dur="4.559">legitimate inside sources the highest</text>
  <text start="4401.139" dur="3.571">levels right next to the President and</text>
  <text start="4402.579" dur="4.801">an IQ at this point who have yeah has a</text>
  <text start="4404.71" dur="6.07">brain to reason exactly so that is</text>
  <text start="4407.38" dur="7.6">that&amp;#39;s basically the people right</text>
  <text start="4410.78" dur="6.42">the president saying that yep ETS are</text>
  <text start="4414.98" dur="4.62">classified because it&amp;#39;s really important</text>
  <text start="4417.2" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;ll shatter people&amp;#39;s belief systems</text>
  <text start="4419.6" dur="5.04">and of course when you talk about the</text>
  <text start="4422.36" dur="3.81">technology component of it deep state</text>
  <text start="4424.64" dur="3.21">doesn&amp;#39;t want bad out there and then</text>
  <text start="4426.17" dur="5.43">programs exist outside of public domain</text>
  <text start="4427.85" dur="5.43">oh if I could if I could flip a button</text>
  <text start="4431.6" dur="3.42">and shatter people&amp;#39;s brains and just go</text>
  <text start="4433.28" dur="4.14">ahead and release everything I would</text>
  <text start="4435.02" dur="3.99">probably do it because I rip the</text>
  <text start="4437.42" dur="3.54">band-aid off I&amp;#39;m the same kind of kind</text>
  <text start="4439.01" dur="3.69">of person man just rip the band-aid off</text>

  <text start="4467.18" dur="3.99">you know we&amp;#39;re an adaptive species we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="4482.36" dur="4.14">on this planet are gonna collapse</text>
  <text start="4483.79" dur="4.36">geoengineering programs out there just</text>
  <text start="4486.5" dur="4.14">destroying everything people injected</text>
  <text start="4488.15" dur="4.59">with heavy metals on a daily basis we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="4490.64" dur="6.39">got oil and coal that we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="4492.74" dur="7.35">dealing with that&amp;#39;s pollute polluting so</text>

  <text start="4520.19" dur="4.5">always like to touch on the idea of</text>
  <text start="4522.7" dur="4.81">partial disclosure you know I like</text>
  <text start="4524.69" dur="4.38">strategy a lot like you do so seeing a</text>
  <text start="4527.51" dur="2.91">lot of these pieces and what these guys</text>

  <text start="4557.17" dur="5.139">there&amp;#39;s a lot that&amp;#39;s being suppressed</text>
  <text start="4559.28" dur="4.259">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s on us to try to wade</text>
  <text start="4562.309" dur="2.071">through the mud and figure out what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4563.539" dur="2.761">real and what&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="4564.38" dur="4.08">right oh I encourage people to look into</text>

  <text start="4571.82" dur="3.839">things and see how many Flat Earth</text>
  <text start="4573.59" dur="6.839">comments you get under the YouTube video</text>
  <text start="4575.659" dur="6.991">of this I guess so many of those and not</text>
  <text start="4580.429" dur="4.321">only that but don&amp;#39;t believe anything I</text>
  <text start="4582.65" dur="3.54">often like to have that mindset don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4584.75" dur="3.03">believe a damn thing because when you</text>
  <text start="4586.19" dur="4.29">get start getting caught up with belief</text>
  <text start="4587.78" dur="4.859">systems then it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very easy to sway</text>
  <text start="4590.48" dur="3.599">you one way or the other or get caught</text>
  <text start="4592.639" dur="3.75">up with it you know don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="4594.079" dur="4.5">anything but research everything and</text>
  <text start="4596.389" dur="4.051">just see what patterns emerge see what</text>
  <text start="4598.579" dur="4.051">patterns start coming up like oh they</text>
  <text start="4600.44" dur="3.9">said that they said that and they figure</text>
  <text start="4602.63" dur="3.299">that out you know well a lot of people</text>
  <text start="4604.34" dur="3.149">are talking about these these space</text>
  <text start="4605.929" dur="5.181">programs there&amp;#39;s a lot of dots to</text>
  <text start="4607.489" dur="6.48">connect there so yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="4611.11" dur="4.89">outside of the box stuff but once you</text>
  <text start="4613.969" dur="5.52">start seeing the patterns then you can</text>
  <text start="4616" dur="5.98">have an idea of what&amp;#39;s going on so it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="4619.489" dur="5.431">be it&amp;#39;s a choice to know for sure and I</text>
