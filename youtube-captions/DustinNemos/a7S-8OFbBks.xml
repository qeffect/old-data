  <text start="50.399" dur="5.131">commit it&amp;#39;s almost a symbolic commitment</text>
  <text start="52.469" dur="5.971">of my shift from where I was to where</text>

  <text start="61.05" dur="6.24">hell out of Dodge and just escape I you</text>
  <text start="65.76" dur="4.2">know people sometimes give me credit for</text>
  <text start="67.29" dur="4.17">some level of genius all I do is I had a</text>
  <text start="69.96" dur="3.269">lot of free times because no one liked</text>
  <text start="71.46" dur="4.4">me as a kid because I was a little bit</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="6.151">nerdy and I researched a lot of things</text>
  <text start="75.86" dur="3.97">you know not a genius I just I did a lot</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="2.279">of digging</text>
  <text start="79.83" dur="3.539">I&amp;#39;ve been down almost every rabbit hole</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="5.25">and most of them are crazy but some of</text>
  <text start="83.369" dur="4.89">them are legit unfortunately and you</text>
  <text start="86.909" dur="3.231">know you&amp;#39;ve all heard that knowledge is</text>

  <text start="90.14" dur="4.869">always a good thing to have I mean in</text>
  <text start="92.34" dur="5.13">some cases it&amp;#39;s really just a curse and</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="6.271">the only thing that I know for sure is</text>
  <text start="97.47" dur="6.359">that there is no escape</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="4.199">I can&amp;#39;t run from this thing the bad guys</text>
  <text start="103.829" dur="4.201">that run in the world like it just</text>
  <text start="105.479" dur="4.471">historically speaking every so often you</text>
  <text start="108.03" dur="4.68">know the good guys have it so good</text>
  <text start="109.95" dur="3.39">because some very important folks in our</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="3.509">history</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="6.569">heroes you know they they did some great</text>
  <text start="116.219" dur="7.561">things some stories of legend you know</text>
  <text start="119.909" dur="5.791">deeds of heroism and they won for us</text>
  <text start="123.78" dur="4.949">such a wonderful world of freedom that</text>
  <text start="125.7" dur="6.39">we got lazy and we forgot to keep an eye</text>
  <text start="128.729" dur="5.311">and bad things crept into power and</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="4.349">after a while</text>
  <text start="134.04" dur="4.8">they didn&amp;#39;t just creep into power they</text>
  <text start="136.439" dur="5.041">took it all over and solidified that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.84" dur="5.009">where we have been and every so often</text>
  <text start="141.48" dur="5.429">new people have to step up and do things</text>
  <text start="143.849" dur="6.72">and there are many heroes stepping up in</text>
  <text start="146.909" dur="6.72">today&amp;#39;s world and you know I commend all</text>
  <text start="150.569" dur="8.491">of them truth tellers who are risking</text>
  <text start="153.629" dur="7.021">their lives I am no hero I didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="159.06" dur="5.31">to do this</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="6.75">actually I&amp;#39;m I tried to run and this is</text>
  <text start="164.37" dur="5.119">you know this is some real talk I tried</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="4.41">to run I tried to get out of the country</text>
  <text start="169.489" dur="4.181">figure out a way they just get rich just</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="4.13">some way to escape what&amp;#39;s coming right</text>
  <text start="173.67" dur="5.64">I figured if maybe I can just get rich</text>
  <text start="175.94" dur="7.03">and I worked I&amp;#39;m talking I don&amp;#39;t know 18</text>
  <text start="179.31" dur="6.09">hours a day for late teens/early most of</text>
  <text start="182.97" dur="7.47">my twenties and I developed a fortune I</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="9.059">was a I was basically retired around 25</text>
  <text start="190.44" dur="6.24">or so off of multifamily rental property</text>
  <text start="194.459" dur="3.601">investing just hundreds of rental</text>
  <text start="196.68" dur="4.199">property apartments I had a small</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="6.269">portion and the cool thing I had to do</text>
  <text start="200.879" dur="5.631">no work right it was easy life and my</text>
  <text start="204.329" dur="5.49">goal was to escape some exotic beach</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="6.099">with beautiful women and watch the world</text>
  <text start="209.819" dur="10.651">burn because I knew it was coming and</text>
  <text start="212.609" dur="10.621">there was nothing I could do but I could</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="5.46">not look away right I always paid</text>
  <text start="223.23" dur="4.649">attention and when I eventually you know</text>
  <text start="225.93" dur="5.369">I I came to the realization that there</text>
  <text start="227.879" dur="5.101">is nowhere to run we either win now or</text>
  <text start="231.299" dur="6.12">there&amp;#39;s nowhere left in the entire</text>
  <text start="232.98" dur="5.849">planet for freedom for liberty for some</text>
  <text start="237.419" dur="5.69">of the unnatural rights that were</text>
  <text start="238.829" dur="6.891">enshrined on the Constitution just for</text>
  <text start="243.109" dur="6.611">for conservative values Christian values</text>
  <text start="245.72" dur="5.349">you know any of that stuff there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="3.299">chance I&amp;#39;ll call you right back George</text>
  <text start="251.069" dur="3.06">thank you for calling brother George has</text>
  <text start="253.019" dur="3.72">been helping me a lot lately</text>
  <text start="254.129" dur="5.28">and we have some really big stuff coming</text>
  <text start="256.739" dur="4.92">up as far as like evidence of Q just</text>
  <text start="259.409" dur="4.951">tons of things just be prepared guys</text>
  <text start="261.659" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s like I said this move is a shift</text>
  <text start="264.36" dur="5.97">I&amp;#39;m not trying to run anymore</text>
  <text start="267.419" dur="6.18">not because I don&amp;#39;t want to run right</text>
  <text start="270.33" dur="4.829">it&amp;#39;s always there but because I realize</text>
  <text start="273.599" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s nowhere to run to and if we lose</text>
  <text start="275.159" dur="6.32">here we will always be slaves like I</text>
  <text start="278.159" dur="5.431">don&amp;#39;t think we even have five years left</text>
  <text start="281.479" dur="4.3">with the level of damage they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="283.59" dur="9.329">like on a genetic level to our species</text>
  <text start="285.779" dur="11.25">as a whole I mean we don&amp;#39;t have much</text>
  <text start="292.919" dur="7.62">time left before all of the great deeds</text>
  <text start="297.029" dur="5.871">all of the great words and all of the</text>
  <text start="300.539" dur="5.551">great intentions are for naught because</text>
  <text start="302.9" dur="5.62">the sheer numbers will have just been to</text>
  <text start="306.09" dur="4.91">got far gone you know at some point it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.52" dur="9.209">too late</text>
  <text start="311" dur="10.8">and just being a father changes things</text>
  <text start="317.729" dur="4.071">too you know you start to see the world</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="10.24">that you leave behind and you know we</text>
  <text start="329.12" dur="8.56">we&amp;#39;ve left behind up here a lot of good</text>
  <text start="332.61" dur="7.739">friends and a family really um and this</text>
  <text start="337.68" dur="4.709">is not an easy thing and I want to kind</text>
  <text start="340.349" dur="5.34">of make a mention of this because people</text>
  <text start="342.389" dur="6.481">don&amp;#39;t often folks who take this kind of</text>
  <text start="345.689" dur="5.811">stance this not names controversial and</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="6.019">it invites conflict and you invite</text>
  <text start="351.5" dur="6.669">problems from powerful people trust me</text>
  <text start="354.889" dur="12.46">it&amp;#39;s not an easy path but when you take</text>
  <text start="358.169" dur="15.06">this kind of path I don&amp;#39;t know you just</text>
  <text start="367.349" dur="8.97">you&amp;#39;ve realized that people are not</text>
  <text start="373.229" dur="4.771">always going to understand and I think</text>
  <text start="376.319" dur="3.451">most of you guys in my audience already</text>
  <text start="378" dur="6.029">kind of noticed I mean I&amp;#39;m speaking to</text>
  <text start="379.77" dur="9.09">the choir here but there is there&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="411.41" dur="8.21">to be honest but it it&amp;#39;s hard sometimes</text>
