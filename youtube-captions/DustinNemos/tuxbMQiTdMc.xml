  <text start="79.61" dur="4.049">that came out against President Trump</text>
  <text start="81.17" dur="4.589">supposedly does not want to testify</text>
  <text start="83.659" dur="4.941">would rather juice some written answers</text>
  <text start="85.759" dur="5.49">of course you would of course you would</text>

  <text start="103.819" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re just trying to drum up the</text>
  <text start="106.09" dur="3.97">allegations and therefore the guilts</text>
  <text start="108.289" dur="3.271">based on allegations but they can never</text>

  <text start="297.75" dur="3.75">that Biden&amp;#39;s having lately now it turns</text>
  <text start="299.4" dur="5.58">out that the whistleblower actually were</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="6.51">traveled to Ukraine with Joe Biden while</text>
  <text start="304.98" dur="4.74">he was still vice president very unusual</text>
  <text start="308.01" dur="3.03">circumstances I mean I don&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="309.72" dur="3.69">they were friends or anything but</text>
  <text start="311.04" dur="5.15">obviously they work together and who</text>
  <text start="313.41" dur="5.79">knows right this is a very bad looking</text>
  <text start="316.19" dur="7.12">situation for for a little Joe Biden his</text>
  <text start="319.2" dur="6.51">time anyway also moving on to get the</text>

  <text start="332.88" dur="6.12">from the Joe Biden campaign defending</text>
  <text start="336.57" dur="4.32">the drug addict contra Biden&amp;#39;s gig okay</text>
  <text start="339" dur="5.34">sure enough as a board member of</text>
  <text start="340.89" dur="5.34">Ukraine&amp;#39;s verismo Holdings of course Joe</text>
  <text start="344.34" dur="5.46">was famous for getting fired but the</text>
  <text start="346.23" dur="5.4">really important thing is Biden</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="5.46">spokesperson the Obama White House</text>
  <text start="351.63" dur="6.45">approved under Biden&amp;#39;s position this</text>
  <text start="355.26" dur="4.95">Kate Beddington deputy campaign director</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="4.83">and communications director of the Biden</text>

  <text start="364.74" dur="7.62">approved by the White House in 2014 so</text>
  <text start="367.89" dur="6.69">of course as we talked about for almost</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="3.93">two years three years now it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="374.58" dur="4.68">quite a while since this channel started</text>
  <text start="376.29" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s almost going on two years we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="379.26" dur="3.06">been talking about the Justice phase</text>
  <text start="380.7" dur="3.59">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about how even the</text>
  <text start="382.32" dur="4.2">highest level players would go down</text>
  <text start="384.29" dur="4.21">obviously Hugh and on gave us some hence</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="4.11">kind of gave us a little bit of an idea</text>
  <text start="388.5" dur="4.32">of what&amp;#39;s coming but anyone can see it</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="4.23">at this point because Biden is gonna</text>
  <text start="392.82" dur="6">pull down some of the others their</text>
  <text start="394.86" dur="7.11">corruption is so interweaved or inter</text>
  <text start="398.82" dur="5.43">woven that there&amp;#39;s no way that they can</text>
  <text start="401.97" dur="4.199">exercise one from the whole group they</text>
  <text start="404.25" dur="4.29">they have to pull down whole group but</text>
  <text start="406.169" dur="5.641">the dominoes will be let loose and</text>
  <text start="408.54" dur="6.27">you&amp;#39;ll see them all fall and even as Joe</text>
  <text start="411.81" dur="3.56">and Rudy were talking about the other</text>
  <text start="414.81" dur="3.26">night</text>
  <text start="415.37" dur="5.1">TV it&amp;#39;s gonna be what they say a</text>
  <text start="418.07" dur="4.319">bang-bang week but it&amp;#39;s gonna bring down</text>
  <text start="420.47" dur="3.66">Hilary&amp;#39;s can lead Hill recently to three</text>
  <text start="422.389" dur="4.321">others and it is going to lead to Obama</text>
  <text start="424.13" dur="5.03">that&amp;#39;s what they said so I would imagine</text>
  <text start="426.71" dur="6">probably be a lot more than three but</text>
  <text start="429.16" dur="4.03">this is going to bring a lot of folks</text>
  <text start="432.71" dur="2.489">down</text>
  <text start="433.19" dur="4.02">remember McCabe said he would bring down</text>
  <text start="435.199" dur="4.321">people with him he&amp;#39;d bring down the FBI</text>
  <text start="437.21" dur="5.25">with him well he probably will because</text>
  <text start="439.52" dur="4.23">he&amp;#39;s going down too so all across the</text>
  <text start="442.46" dur="4.17">board you&amp;#39;re seeing corruption get</text>
  <text start="443.75" dur="6.33">yanked out of our system and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.63" dur="7.02">really cool to see so Adam Schiff has</text>
  <text start="450.08" dur="5.3">been lying to you entire thing a clown</text>
  <text start="453.65" dur="4.079">show okay</text>

  <text start="468.38" dur="3.69">you mean Adam Schiff made the argument</text>
  <text start="470.45" dur="4.35">I&amp;#39;m just putting it out there for you to</text>
  <text start="472.07" dur="5.129">respond there&amp;#39;s an argument against the</text>
  <text start="474.8" dur="5.28">argue I haven&amp;#39;t heard that argument and</text>
  <text start="477.199" dur="5.22">so there&amp;#39;s an argument against</text>
  <text start="480.08" dur="4.17">transparency there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s an argument</text>
  <text start="482.419" dur="3.891">I don&amp;#39;t know hold on a second hold on a</text>
  <text start="484.25" dur="4.65">second there&amp;#39;s an argument in favor of</text>
  <text start="486.31" dur="4.93">cherry-picking selective releases of</text>
  <text start="488.9" dur="5.25">texts there&amp;#39;s an argument in favor of</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="4.77">only telling the American public what is</text>
  <text start="494.15" dur="3.87">best in the interests of wanting to take</text>
  <text start="496.01" dur="4.17">down a sitting president maybe you</text>
  <text start="498.02" dur="4.11">should ask what was said inside a</text>
  <text start="500.18" dur="3.959">Volkers deposition during his</text>

  <text start="513.2" dur="3.06">investigation into the Biden&amp;#39;s why do</text>
  <text start="514.64" dur="2.19">you ask what did ambassador Volcker say</text>
  <text start="516.26" dur="1.98">about that</text>
  <text start="516.83" dur="3.269">that&amp;#39;s a great question I&amp;#39;m glad that</text>
  <text start="518.24" dur="3.15">you asked that question and I&amp;#39;ll tell</text>
  <text start="520.099" dur="3.301">you the reason why that question was so</text>
  <text start="521.39" dur="3.72">important for you to ask is for many</text>
  <text start="523.4" dur="4.379">things because he was in this room for</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="4.95">several hours and during several hours</text>
  <text start="527.779" dur="4.621">of testimony he talked about how</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="3.93">president Olinsky had no idea that there</text>
  <text start="532.4" dur="4.17">was a hold on aid at the time the July</text>

  <text start="549.35" dur="3">this is what the transcribed interview</text>
  <text start="550.61" dur="3.99">would tell you if you ask this question</text>
  <text start="552.35" dur="2.88">I&amp;#39;m glad that we were having this</text>
  <text start="554.6" dur="3.18">discussion</text>
  <text start="555.23" dur="4.98">the next day ambassador Volker meets</text>
  <text start="557.78" dur="5.55">with President Solinsky and in that</text>

  <text start="582.62" dur="5.4">to this entire time the aid was getting</text>
  <text start="585.83" dur="5.04">released it was going to get released</text>
  <text start="588.02" dur="4.5">and guess what happened the aid got</text>

  <text start="760.09" dur="4.04">you are but many of you aren&amp;#39;t asking</text>
  <text start="762.55" dur="4.29">the most important questions such as</text>
  <text start="764.13" dur="4.84">what did you hear last Thursday that we</text>
  <text start="766.84" dur="3.42">don&amp;#39;t yet know about Adam Schiff won&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="790.15" dur="4.47">going to work of course but let them do</text>
  <text start="793.24" dur="3.9">that and that&amp;#39;s the correct way to</text>
  <text start="794.62" dur="5.01">proceed what Nancy Pelosi is trying to</text>
  <text start="797.14" dur="4.5">do is just say that oh the vote is not</text>
  <text start="799.63" dur="4.77">necessary which doesn&amp;#39;t make a lot of</text>
  <text start="801.64" dur="5.43">sense and is unconstitutional we also</text>
  <text start="804.4" dur="4.86">have and you guys know I&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="807.07" dur="5.03">about fake Magga or Trojan Magga</text>
  <text start="809.26" dur="5.569">I would say it&amp;#39;s probably a better word</text>
  <text start="812.1" dur="5.219">for a long time I was queued for it</text>
  <text start="814.829" dur="5.88">clearly cute respects that there are</text>
  <text start="817.319" dur="6.481">people want our team supposedly who are</text>
  <text start="820.709" dur="5.04">not really on our team so FoxNews being</text>
  <text start="823.8" dur="5.49">a prime example I would say a couple of</text>
  <text start="825.749" dur="5.851">others maybe Oh weigh-ins jack the sober</text>
  <text start="829.29" dur="4.95">because he made the fake debunk chat log</text>
  <text start="831.6" dur="4.289">stuff I would say Alex Jones you know I</text>
  <text start="834.24" dur="3.289">would say you know he was he was already</text>
  <text start="835.889" dur="5.161">exposed these folks as being uh</text>
  <text start="837.529" dur="5.831">according to him mos or possibly Mossad</text>
  <text start="841.05" dur="4.44">link and there&amp;#39;s others out there as</text>
  <text start="843.36" dur="6.419">well they&amp;#39;re fake Magra but none bigger</text>
  <text start="845.49" dur="6.87">than Fox News themselves so Fox News has</text>
  <text start="849.779" dur="5.37">now started playing the same kind of</text>
  <text start="852.36" dur="4.62">poll game tricks that the left has been</text>
  <text start="855.149" dur="3.99">doing any they always did let&amp;#39;s be</text>
  <text start="856.98" dur="4.529">honest here but they&amp;#39;re over sampling</text>
  <text start="859.139" dur="4.651">Democrats by fourteen points in their</text>
  <text start="861.509" dur="3.63">junk impeachment poll so they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="863.79" dur="3.14">to make it seem as though the majority</text>
  <text start="865.139" dur="4.771">of the country actually favors</text>
  <text start="866.93" dur="5.889">impeachment and it&amp;#39;s not true at all so</text>
  <text start="869.91" dur="5.21">this is a manipulative trick and Fox</text>
  <text start="872.819" dur="5.031">News has really gone too far on this one</text>
  <text start="875.12" dur="5.74">that is insane</text>
  <text start="877.85" dur="6.039">of course Paul Ryan is a new board</text>
  <text start="880.86" dur="5.159">member so we also have a State</text>

  <text start="899.49" dur="5.789">warned six times at least probably that</text>
  <text start="903.209" dur="4.44">she was doing so people were concerned</text>
  <text start="905.279" dur="4.141">for her I&amp;#39;m sure that she was violating</text>
  <text start="907.649" dur="4.021">so many laws and she was probably</text>
  <text start="909.42" dur="4.8">thinking well what can you do about it</text>
