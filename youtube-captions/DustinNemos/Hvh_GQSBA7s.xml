  <text start="271.58" dur="4.02">face-saving right they they&amp;#39;re very as</text>
  <text start="274.13" dur="3.65">part of Chinese culture you have to</text>
  <text start="275.6" dur="7.61">understand face you have to understand</text>
  <text start="277.78" dur="9.04">it&amp;#39;s a lot like pride in the sense that</text>
  <text start="283.21" dur="6.85">you know you&amp;#39;re if you hurt someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.82" dur="4.92">image if you hurt someone&amp;#39;s face you</text>

  <text start="298.61" dur="3.66">part of their sort of culture it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="300.35" dur="5.1">prickly very defensive in that nature</text>
  <text start="302.27" dur="6.06">and they have always kind of claimed</text>
  <text start="305.45" dur="4.5">ownership of Taiwan and it just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="308.33" dur="3.8">it doesn&amp;#39;t of course make any sense</text>
  <text start="309.95" dur="5.82">Taiwan&amp;#39;s its own nation and they fled</text>
  <text start="312.13" dur="5.11">chairman mao the evil monster that back</text>
  <text start="315.77" dur="4.17">right back into evil if we want but</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="4.44">anyway moving on you know communism</text>
  <text start="319.94" dur="3.53">itself has always been evil and then</text>
  <text start="321.68" dur="4.68">monsters like Mao have always used it to</text>
  <text start="323.47" dur="4.93">gain power and destroy what was already</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="3.99">there before and in that particular</text>
  <text start="328.4" dur="3.75">revolution millions were murdered and</text>
  <text start="330.35" dur="5.61">some people were taken when boiled in</text>
  <text start="332.15" dur="5.37">pots it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s crazy so obviously we</text>
  <text start="335.96" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t want to have any more of those and</text>
  <text start="337.52" dur="4.8">we don&amp;#39;t want that ideology to spread so</text>
  <text start="340.07" dur="4.08">that government is now the government</text>
  <text start="342.32" dur="4.02">that is facing off with our president</text>
  <text start="344.15" dur="3.98">and the trade war and honestly it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="346.34" dur="4.95">current see war you should be ready</text>
  <text start="348.13" dur="4.75">possibly I can&amp;#39;t get financial advice</text>
  <text start="351.29" dur="4.2">but if I had money in an investment bank</text>
  <text start="352.88" dur="5.52">I would pull it out I would try to put</text>
  <text start="355.49" dur="4.83">in a credit union or into silver or gold</text>
  <text start="358.4" dur="3.48">or something and if you&amp;#39;ve got funds</text>
  <text start="360.32" dur="3.84">that you&amp;#39;ve got something to do with if</text>
  <text start="361.88" dur="5.91">you&amp;#39;ve got a retirement you know there</text>
  <text start="364.16" dur="5.52">are options out there there&amp;#39;s not a lot</text>
  <text start="367.79" dur="3.18">of reason to keep it in the system</text>
  <text start="369.68" dur="3.3">pretty soon you&amp;#39;re gonna be paying money</text>
  <text start="370.97" dur="3.47">just to save money you can be paying an</text>
  <text start="372.98" dur="4.11">interest instead of earning an interest</text>
  <text start="374.44" dur="7.24">because that is next this system is</text>
  <text start="377.09" dur="8.91">about to fall apart now kind of you know</text>
  <text start="381.68" dur="6.03">it&amp;#39;s interesting just to see China react</text>
  <text start="386" dur="3.21">to these situations obviously our</text>
  <text start="387.71" dur="4.38">president has sold billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="389.21" dur="6.39">with the equipment and weaponry to</text>
  <text start="392.09" dur="4.71">Taiwan recently has actually took phone</text>
  <text start="395.6" dur="2.82">calls from the president to Taiwan</text>
  <text start="396.8" dur="2.13">things like that so you know these</text>
  <text start="398.42" dur="2.64">things</text>
  <text start="398.93" dur="4.38">piss off China it hurts their face it</text>
  <text start="401.06" dur="5.34">says to the world well we don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="403.31" dur="5.16">listen to your claim that you supposedly</text>
  <text start="406.4" dur="3.72">have over Taiwan we don&amp;#39;t really care</text>
  <text start="408.47" dur="3.42">what you say Taiwan is independent we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.12" dur="3.03">gonna talk to them you don&amp;#39;t get to tell</text>
  <text start="411.89" dur="3.06">us what to do you don&amp;#39;t get to tell us</text>
  <text start="413.15" dur="3.33">who we can talk to who we can&amp;#39;t talk to</text>
  <text start="414.95" dur="3.57">just because you think that you&amp;#39;re some</text>
  <text start="416.48" dur="4.82">superpower over there in the East you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.52" dur="5.82">not you&amp;#39;re economically weak and</text>
  <text start="421.3" dur="4.63">President Trump can crush you so we</text>
  <text start="424.34" dur="3.84">understand that China has been the real</text>
  <text start="425.93" dur="7.04">threat for quite a while now and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="428.18" dur="4.79">piggybacked on our growth and our our</text>
  <text start="433.99" dur="5.71">creative systems you know our creative</text>
  <text start="437.42" dur="4.62">systems in the US where we are inventive</text>
  <text start="439.7" dur="6.45">and we are innovative and we you know</text>
  <text start="442.04" dur="5.22">design and create the future that&amp;#39;s part</text>
  <text start="446.15" dur="3.75">of being creative that&amp;#39;s part of being</text>
  <text start="447.26" dur="4.62">free and capitalist because you you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="449.9" dur="3.45">motivated to go out and do something for</text>
  <text start="451.88" dur="3.09">the world because it helps you it helps</text>
  <text start="453.35" dur="3.03">you and your family and you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="454.97" dur="4.14">make a better life for your family like</text>
  <text start="456.38" dur="4.64">everyone else&amp;#39;s that love for your</text>
  <text start="459.11" dur="4.56">family that love for yourself</text>
  <text start="461.02" dur="4.51">combined with humans and ain&amp;#39;t greed for</text>
  <text start="463.67" dur="4.2">resources and such it&amp;#39;s what makes</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="4.05">capitalism work so well but these you</text>
  <text start="467.87" dur="3.72">actually start turning your greed into</text>
  <text start="469.58" dur="3.9">helping other people and in helping</text>
  <text start="471.59" dur="4.08">other people you are in the living and</text>
  <text start="473.48" dur="4.17">that is the beauty of capitalist and</text>
  <text start="475.67" dur="4.08">that is why in the Chinese culture you</text>
  <text start="477.65" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t get much innovation even though</text>
  <text start="479.75" dur="4.95">they have a higher IQ average than we do</text>
  <text start="481.4" dur="5.1">in the West they have to steal from us</text>
  <text start="484.7" dur="3.15">because if you think outside the box</text>
  <text start="486.5" dur="4.47">over there you&amp;#39;re probably going to get</text>
  <text start="487.85" dur="5.64">killed or organ harvesting now we also</text>
  <text start="490.97" dur="3.72">have kind of back to some of the damage</text>
  <text start="493.49" dur="2.58">that they have done and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="494.69" dur="3.45">picture of a little baby right now</text>
  <text start="496.07" dur="4.14">getting vaccine stabbed right up here in</text>
  <text start="498.14" dur="4.77">the left this is the truth about</text>
  <text start="500.21" dur="4.74">vaccines calm and it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="502.91" dur="4.02">because Robert F Kennedy actually came</text>
  <text start="504.95" dur="5.01">out and and sort of put out a response</text>
  <text start="506.93" dur="5.73">to his own family okay yeah some some</text>
  <text start="509.96" dur="5.04">family of the Kennedy clan had actually</text>
  <text start="512.66" dur="5.46">put out a sort of an attack on him and</text>
  <text start="515" dur="6.06">his position on vaccines and he puts out</text>
  <text start="518.12" dur="4.95">a response and his articles Americans</text>
  <text start="521.06" dur="4.98">can handle an open discussion on</text>
  <text start="523.07" dur="5.46">vaccines so he responds to the criticism</text>
  <text start="526.04" dur="4.02">from this family and I won&amp;#39;t make you go</text>
  <text start="528.53" dur="3.6">through the whole thing it is it is</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="3.57">incredibly interesting and I really do</text>
  <text start="532.13" dur="2.05">suggest that you&amp;#39;ll never stick yourself</text>
  <text start="533.63" dur="3.67">with facts</text>
  <text start="534.18" dur="6.12">again okay it is really important</text>
  <text start="537.3" dur="4.95">obviously no safety testing okay he</text>
  <text start="540.3" dur="4.8">explains his skepticism in his history</text>
  <text start="542.25" dur="5.25">he explains how autism and vaccines are</text>
  <text start="545.1" dur="5.01">linked you guys know I&amp;#39;m friends with</text>
  <text start="547.5" dur="4.2">dr. Andrew Wakefield I mean I have great</text>
  <text start="550.11" dur="4.53">respect for him even before I met him</text>
  <text start="551.7" dur="5.94">okay I mean he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s the background on</text>
  <text start="554.64" dur="6.449">my phone now if you guys have probably</text>
  <text start="557.64" dur="4.92">showed you that before but this will</text>
  <text start="561.089" dur="5.881">must sitting together was the background</text>
  <text start="562.56" dur="6.69">otherwise because he&amp;#39;s actually working</text>
  <text start="566.97" dur="4.41">on another documentary now as well so</text>
  <text start="569.25" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s very exciting getting the truth</text>
  <text start="571.38" dur="3.87">out there it&amp;#39;s important even if they</text>
  <text start="573.72" dur="3.119">destroy your career and they destroy</text>
  <text start="575.25" dur="4.89">your life the way they destroy dr.</text>
  <text start="576.839" dur="6.87">Andrew Wakefield and then he continues</text>
  <text start="580.14" dur="5.94">on we are killing children HHS has also</text>

  <text start="1227.84" dur="4.32">for the border situation this is very</text>
  <text start="1230.03" dur="6.11">interesting because the goal is to</text>
  <text start="1232.16" dur="7.05">actually stem the flow of illegals by</text>
  <text start="1236.14" dur="5.23">effectively nullifying this this rule</text>
  <text start="1239.21" dur="3.75">this this if you come with a child we</text>
  <text start="1241.37" dur="3.15">can only hold you for twenty days and we</text>
  <text start="1242.96" dur="2.99">have to let you go with the child that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1244.52" dur="4.53">probably not even yours</text>
  <text start="1245.95" dur="5.23">and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s overwhelmed our border</text>
  <text start="1249.05" dur="4.11">lately is all of these family units you</text>
  <text start="1251.18" dur="4.77">know it&amp;#39;s up four or five times that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1253.16" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s unusual and that&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="1255.95" dur="4.41">because soros is down there you know</text>
  <text start="1257.51" dur="5.19">paying them hundreds of dollars in cash</text>

  <text start="1262.7" dur="5.7">them to get rides stuff through Mexico</text>
  <text start="1264.62" dur="5.58">all that so we&amp;#39;re finally getting some</text>
  <text start="1268.4" dur="4.56">some steps there and what that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1270.2" dur="5.19">do basically is give them a better place</text>
  <text start="1272.96" dur="7.26">to stay short term with the family units</text>
  <text start="1275.39" dur="8.13">together unseparated where they can wait</text>
  <text start="1280.22" dur="5.13">for the trial now he did say it was</text>
  <text start="1283.52" dur="3">unsecured which I didn&amp;#39;t like that that</text>
  <text start="1285.35" dur="2.79">means they could probably just escape</text>
  <text start="1286.52" dur="5.79">and go right into the country if they</text>
  <text start="1288.14" dur="6.48">want but I&amp;#39;m yeah we&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="1292.31" dur="4.11">reduction in that flow significantly at</text>
  <text start="1294.62" dur="4.64">the border so it&amp;#39;s a big step and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1296.42" dur="5.76">key aspect of our multi-layer strategy</text>
  <text start="1299.26" dur="4.78">so he says so what this rule does is it</text>
  <text start="1302.18" dur="3.54">establishes very high standards of care</text>
  <text start="1304.04" dur="3.75">for children in federal custody first</text>
  <text start="1305.72" dur="5.55">and foremost the implicit implemented</text>
  <text start="1307.79" dur="4.92">the twenty-year-old settlement but it</text>
  <text start="1311.27" dur="3.87">also allows us to keep families through</text>

  <text start="1324.71" dur="4.54">going to see a reduction in</text>
