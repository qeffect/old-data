  <text start="128.97" dur="5.4">their support for us all right so our</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="5.31">first story comes out of the Gateway</text>
  <text start="134.37" dur="8.49">pundit tick-tock AG bar receives FISA</text>
  <text start="138.15" dur="8.91">abuse report from IG Horowitz so this is</text>
  <text start="142.86" dur="6.57">just a draft it is not the final report</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="4.05">that report is likely going to come out</text>
  <text start="149.43" dur="3.81">towards the end of this month or even</text>
  <text start="151.11" dur="4.17">the beginning of next month so that is</text>
  <text start="153.24" dur="4.05">fast approaching it seems far away but</text>
  <text start="155.28" dur="4.89">not really it&amp;#39;ll be here before you know</text>
  <text start="157.29" dur="4.2">it and so Comey and anyone else who is</text>
  <text start="160.17" dur="3.66">involved in this should be</text>
  <text start="161.49" dur="5.22">very very nervous especially because it</text>
  <text start="163.83" dur="6.9">appears as though Angie McCabe is going</text>
  <text start="166.71" dur="7.02">to be charged so not necessarily in</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="5.94">direct relation yet to the fines abuse</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="5.43">is because of course his case is in</text>
  <text start="176.67" dur="7.2">regards to his leaking in the Clinton</text>
  <text start="179.16" dur="7.59">email case however he is also involved</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="4.38">in the FISA abuse as is combing Comey</text>
  <text start="186.75" dur="5.55">had actually signed off on one of them</text>
  <text start="188.25" dur="9.33">as well as rod Rosen seen so when it</text>
  <text start="192.3" dur="7.62">comes to the IG report really the IG the</text>
  <text start="197.58" dur="5.13">purpose of it is not to prosecute or</text>
  <text start="199.92" dur="4.44">bring charges they really just do an</text>
  <text start="202.71" dur="5.03">internal investigation and then they</text>
  <text start="204.36" dur="6.57">write a report and they can recommend</text>
  <text start="207.74" dur="4.81">criminal charges be brought based on the</text>
  <text start="210.93" dur="3.81">fact that there&amp;#39;s likely criminal</text>
  <text start="212.55" dur="4.62">activity that was revealed in their</text>
  <text start="214.74" dur="7.02">investigation but they don&amp;#39;t prosecute</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="7.29">or charge so this document this report</text>
  <text start="221.76" dur="5.94">is really just supplemental material</text>
  <text start="224.46" dur="4.95">supporting material for the durum</text>
  <text start="227.7" dur="3.36">investigation because John Durham and</text>
  <text start="229.41" dur="3.9">his team they&amp;#39;re investigating right now</text>
  <text start="231.06" dur="6">the origins of the Russian hoax</text>
  <text start="233.31" dur="6.57">investigation including the FISA abuses</text>
  <text start="237.06" dur="5.4">which of course really amount to this</text>
  <text start="239.88" dur="5.1">attempted coup that was ongoing for</text>
  <text start="242.46" dur="5.64">quite some time and so of course that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.98" dur="5.67">treason this is a big deal so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.1" dur="5.58">likely going to see this wrap up rather</text>
  <text start="250.65" dur="5.64">quickly probably over the next month or</text>
  <text start="253.68" dur="5.49">so I would say so I&amp;#39;ll be following up</text>
  <text start="256.29" dur="4.59">on that but Comey and anyone else</text>
  <text start="259.17" dur="6.27">involved should be very nervous at this</text>
  <text start="260.88" dur="8.06">point all right in other news kind of</text>
  <text start="265.44" dur="8.22">related I think and this is just a</text>
  <text start="268.94" dur="6.9">theory that I have but when it comes to</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="5.01">Ray so right now</text>
  <text start="275.84" dur="5.47">Ray has always been sort of a</text>
  <text start="278.67" dur="4.5">controversial figure nobody really knows</text>
  <text start="281.31" dur="4.44">whether or not he&amp;#39;s a good guy or a bad</text>
  <text start="283.17" dur="5.49">guy it&amp;#39;s hard to tell at this point and</text>
  <text start="285.75" dur="5.64">really it appears as though he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="288.66" dur="5.34">just been working to restore the image</text>
  <text start="291.39" dur="3.34">of the FBI which I can so I can kind of</text>
  <text start="294" dur="3.52">understand</text>
  <text start="294.73" dur="5.76">that and I would understand why that is</text>
  <text start="297.52" dur="7.01">important because of course right now</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="7.77">what we&amp;#39;ve had happen is that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="304.53" dur="7.39">quiet civil war going on within our own</text>
  <text start="308.26" dur="5.46">government in every level every level so</text>
  <text start="311.92" dur="4.02">within the White House you have people</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="4.29">who are rubbing shoulders together</text>
  <text start="315.94" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re working together but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="318.01" dur="4.02">necessarily on the same team you have</text>
  <text start="320.86" dur="4.17">the Patriots and then you have the</text>
  <text start="322.03" dur="5.64">globalists they&amp;#39;re definitely not in the</text>
  <text start="325.03" dur="4.14">same team so the White House we&amp;#39;d have</text>
  <text start="327.67" dur="3.6">this issue and the Justice Department we</text>
  <text start="329.17" dur="3.9">have this issue and also in intelligence</text>
  <text start="331.27" dur="3.6">agencies you have good FBI agents you</text>
  <text start="333.07" dur="4.26">have bad FBI agents you have good CIA</text>
  <text start="334.87" dur="4.77">agents you have bad CIA agents right</text>
  <text start="337.33" dur="6.78">you have good judges and bad judges</text>
  <text start="339.64" dur="7.14">that&amp;#39;s how it is right now and so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="344.11" dur="6.45">why a lot of times they have to operate</text>
  <text start="346.78" dur="5.73">using optics so for example session</text>
  <text start="350.56" dur="5.37">sessions is a good example of optics</text>
  <text start="352.51" dur="8.13">where he was made to look like a bad guy</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="10.05">like someone who was not necessarily on</text>
  <text start="360.64" dur="7.53">the Trump team that they were at odds</text>
  <text start="365.98" dur="4.35">without one one another and they had</text>
  <text start="368.17" dur="4.68">really advertised that a lot and you</text>
  <text start="370.33" dur="5.16">know Trump&amp;#39;s little tweet storms against</text>
  <text start="372.85" dur="5.46">sessions but really that was all for</text>
  <text start="375.49" dur="4.77">optics because they needed to gain they</text>
  <text start="378.31" dur="4.71">needed a garner support from the left</text>
  <text start="380.26" dur="4.8">for sessions because sessions was</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="4.83">someone who when he was confirmed he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="385.06" dur="6.69">barely skated by by the skin of his</text>
  <text start="387.85" dur="6.75">teeth so they needed to garner more</text>
  <text start="391.75" dur="4.92">support for him so that anything that</text>
  <text start="394.6" dur="7.49">was initiated under him would not be</text>
  <text start="396.67" dur="8.22">discredited later as being political so</text>
  <text start="402.09" dur="5.86">what they did was very tactful was</text>
  <text start="404.89" dur="10.11">clever because as soon as Trump started</text>
  <text start="407.95" dur="13.1">criticizing sessions publicly a swarm</text>
  <text start="415" dur="10.08">from the left came to support him and</text>
  <text start="421.05" dur="6.19">that&amp;#39;s exactly what they wanted that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.08" dur="4.739">exactly what Trump and his team wanted</text>
  <text start="427.24" dur="5.37">because let&amp;#39;s not forget that sessions</text>
  <text start="429.819" dur="4.981">had hired Hoover and Hoover is the one</text>
  <text start="432.61" dur="4.649">who is still investigating the Clinton</text>
  <text start="434.8" dur="6.839">Foundation including crimes against</text>
  <text start="437.259" dur="6.871">children this is still an ongoing thing</text>
  <text start="441.639" dur="3.661">it&amp;#39;s being done quietly but the reason</text>
  <text start="444.13" dur="3.12">why these things are done quietly</text>
  <text start="445.3" dur="3.959">including John Durham&amp;#39;s investigation</text>
  <text start="447.25" dur="3.479">into the FISA and everything else why</text>
  <text start="449.259" dur="5">it&amp;#39;s then quietly is because that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="450.729" dur="6.451">an investigation is supposed to be done</text>
  <text start="454.259" dur="4.871">because if you do it too publicly then</text>
  <text start="457.18" dur="8.94">you risk that investigation being</text>
  <text start="459.13" dur="9.15">tainted so that is why optics are very</text>
  <text start="466.12" dur="4.47">important so for me that&amp;#39;s why this</text>
  <text start="468.28" dur="4.41">whole situation whether or not</text>
  <text start="470.59" dur="4.169">Christopher raised it is a white hat or</text>
  <text start="472.69" dur="5.31">a black I don&amp;#39;t know I can&amp;#39;t say for</text>
  <text start="474.759" dur="5.701">sure but I know that a lot of it is</text>
  <text start="478" dur="4.8">about optics now one thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="480.46" dur="5.73">interesting to me is that right now as</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="7.76">they&amp;#39;re trying to wrap up the FISA</text>
  <text start="486.19" dur="7.14">investigation this whole attempted coup</text>
  <text start="490.56" dur="4.63">this article from true Punta is talking</text>
  <text start="493.33" dur="4.05">about how they&amp;#39;re supposedly a</text>
  <text start="495.19" dur="4.289">whistleblower an insider from the FBI</text>
  <text start="497.38" dur="6">who wants to come out with very damaging</text>
  <text start="499.479" dur="5.791">information about Christopher Rea now</text>
  <text start="503.38" dur="4.259">they don&amp;#39;t mention who it is or anything</text>
  <text start="505.27" dur="4.47">or even the specifics of the information</text>
  <text start="507.639" dur="4.921">but they&amp;#39;re saying that there is a plan</text>
  <text start="509.74" dur="4.919">to roll out this information but then if</text>
  <text start="512.56" dur="5.75">I look at another article another</text>
  <text start="514.659" dur="5.67">article talks about how Adam Schiff is</text>
  <text start="518.31" dur="5.589">coming out in support of this</text>
  <text start="520.329" dur="7.591">whistleblower that sets off red flags</text>
  <text start="523.899" dur="5.731">for me oh so a whistleblower is going to</text>
  <text start="527.92" dur="7.02">come out against Christopher Rea the</text>
  <text start="529.63" dur="8.09">leader of the FBI right now who would</text>
  <text start="534.94" dur="2.78">replace Comey</text>
  <text start="538.56" dur="7.99">Adam Schiff is in support of that guy</text>
  <text start="542.97" dur="5.05">really and Adam Schiff is pushing this</text>
  <text start="546.55" dur="3.36">idea that we need to allow this</text>
  <text start="548.02" dur="7.71">whistleblower to come forward because it</text>
  <text start="549.91" dur="8.369">is very urgent the timing seems rather</text>
  <text start="555.73" dur="5.15">coincidental to me and I don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="558.279" dur="4.921">anything coming from Adam Schiff</text>
  <text start="560.88" dur="4.99">especially when it comes to this whole</text>
  <text start="563.2" dur="6.72">Russian collusion hoax because he had a</text>
  <text start="565.87" dur="5.94">major hand in it as well so this is very</text>
  <text start="569.92" dur="4.89">interesting and I don&amp;#39;t really believe</text>
  <text start="571.81" dur="5.33">that there is real damaging information</text>
  <text start="574.81" dur="4.65">against Christopher especially since</text>
  <text start="577.14" dur="6.1">Adam Schiff is the one who is coming out</text>
  <text start="579.46" dur="6.48">in support of it but we&amp;#39;ll see it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.24" dur="5.88">still a developing story so I will give</text>
  <text start="585.94" dur="5.31">updates as it comes up all right in</text>
  <text start="589.12" dur="6.51">other news Felicity Huffman she was</text>
  <text start="591.25" dur="8.21">sentenced to 14 days so that&amp;#39;s all she</text>
  <text start="595.63" dur="6.36">got 14 days for her role in this whole</text>
  <text start="599.46" dur="5.71">College Admission scandal and of course</text>
  <text start="601.99" dur="6.21">she had given some very beefed up</text>
  <text start="605.17" dur="5.97">apology growling about how sorry she was</text>
  <text start="608.2" dur="4.74">and how she had hurt individuals and you</text>
  <text start="611.14" dur="5.07">were very aware of what you were doing</text>
  <text start="612.94" dur="7.47">Felicity Huffman you and anyone else who</text>
  <text start="616.21" dur="7.22">took part in this you stole the</text>
  <text start="620.41" dur="5.58">opportunity from others who work hard</text>
  <text start="623.43" dur="8.74">because again at these universities they</text>
  <text start="625.99" dur="8.1">only have so many seats but the thing is</text>
  <text start="632.17" dur="6.51">is that when you have people like</text>
  <text start="634.09" dur="11.81">Felicity Huffman who pay thousands of</text>
  <text start="638.68" dur="12.83">dollars to alter test scores to fake</text>
  <text start="645.9" dur="11.11">athletic ability to enter an educational</text>
  <text start="651.51" dur="7.69">institution fraudulently you are</text>
  <text start="657.01" dur="4.71">stealing that opportunity from those who</text>
  <text start="659.2" dur="6.83">actually did work hard to try to gain</text>
  <text start="661.72" dur="7.23">that opportunity and she is the first to</text>
  <text start="666.03" dur="4.78">be sentenced in this college admissions</text>
  <text start="668.95" dur="4.47">scandal there of course are several</text>
  <text start="670.81" dur="4.32">dozen others who were involved in this</text>
  <text start="673.42" dur="3.81">case including Lori Loughlin who</text>
  <text start="675.13" dur="4.77">allegedly had paid a half a million</text>
  <text start="677.23" dur="4.77">dollars to get her daughter&amp;#39;s into a</text>
  <text start="679.9" dur="4.89">college based on rowing ability that</text>
  <text start="682" dur="5.4">they actually didn&amp;#39;t even have so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="684.79" dur="4.98">see what happens with this case and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="687.4" dur="5.71">give updates as they come up</text>
  <text start="689.77" dur="7.84">so in other news we have another hearing</text>
  <text start="693.11" dur="6.24">that is ongoing right now so this even</text>
  <text start="697.61" dur="3.72">though it involves Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="699.35" dur="4.8">and even though they are being exposed</text>
  <text start="701.33" dur="4.86">for their crimes in this hearing they</text>
  <text start="704.15" dur="3.6">are not the ones under scrutiny they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="706.19" dur="3.63">not the ones who are facing prosecution</text>
  <text start="707.75" dur="3.45">and of course I had talked about this</text>
  <text start="709.82" dur="3.96">I&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for days</text>
  <text start="711.2" dur="6.18">now because this is a very big deal so</text>
  <text start="713.78" dur="6.06">the investigative reporters who had</text>
  <text start="717.38" dur="4.86">exposed Planned Parenthood by going</text>
  <text start="719.84" dur="5.61">undercover they are facing 15 felony</text>
  <text start="722.24" dur="7.76">charges based on apparently the</text>
  <text start="725.45" dur="8.46">violation of privacy which apparently</text>
  <text start="730" dur="6.37">Trump&amp;#39;s the sanctity of life I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="733.91" dur="4.74">know how that works but anyway so they</text>
  <text start="736.37" dur="4.17">had tried to expose Planned Parenthood&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="738.65" dur="4.74">crimes and now they&amp;#39;re facing criminal</text>
  <text start="740.54" dur="5.28">charges themselves so as this hearing is</text>
  <text start="743.39" dur="4.59">ongoing more and more information is</text>
  <text start="745.82" dur="5.7">revealed about what was actually</text>
  <text start="747.98" dur="4.86">occurring within the abortion practices</text>
  <text start="751.52" dur="5.64">of Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="752.84" dur="7.32">so recently now the Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="757.16" dur="8.46">an executive had made a major omission</text>
  <text start="760.16" dur="7.58">about baby body-part harvesting so</text>
  <text start="765.62" dur="4.41">recently as a part of that hearing</text>
  <text start="767.74" dur="4.3">against undercover journalist David</text>
  <text start="770.03" dur="3.51">daleiden and Sandra Merritt hopefully I</text>
  <text start="772.04" dur="3.39">pronounced the names right I know</text>
  <text start="773.54" dur="4.05">sometimes I get it wrong so correct me</text>
  <text start="775.43" dur="4.53">if you know how to pronounce and I did</text>
  <text start="777.59" dur="5.4">it wrong please correct me okay so</text>
  <text start="779.96" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re hearing a quote semi-retired</text>
  <text start="782.99" dur="4.92">Planned Parenthood executive admitted</text>
  <text start="784.88" dur="5.79">that the abortion business had no ban on</text>
  <text start="787.91" dur="4.83">altering abortion procedures in order to</text>
  <text start="790.67" dur="3.9">better harvest baby body parts that</text>
  <text start="792.74" dur="3.69">would later be sold allegedly for a</text>
  <text start="794.57" dur="4.77">profit okay so in one of their videos</text>
  <text start="796.43" dur="10.74">when they went undercover and they were</text>
  <text start="799.34" dur="10.23">talking to an employee about the value</text>
  <text start="807.17" dur="6.39">of different body parts they had said</text>
  <text start="809.57" dur="8.36">that one of the most valuable body parts</text>
  <text start="813.56" dur="10.209">is the head and it was very difficult to</text>
  <text start="817.93" dur="8.99">get a full cranial specimen so because</text>
  <text start="823.769" dur="5.55">of course as it&amp;#39;s passing through the</text>
  <text start="826.92" dur="3.87">birth canal of course it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="829.319" dur="7.01">crushed or whatever and so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="830.79" dur="9.269">risk of damage so in order to preserve</text>
  <text start="836.329" dur="8.38">the cranial specimen quote-unquote so</text>
  <text start="840.059" dur="8.07">that it can gain more profit later on</text>
  <text start="844.709" dur="6.141">when they sell it to keep it intact they</text>
  <text start="848.129" dur="6.83">will turn the baby so that it&amp;#39;s breech</text>
  <text start="850.85" dur="10.359">because then a breech baby will dilate</text>
  <text start="854.959" dur="11.62">the mother more and so this will assist</text>
  <text start="861.209" dur="7.8">in them being able to preserve the head</text>
  <text start="866.579" dur="6.75">so that they can get that full specimen</text>
  <text start="869.009" dur="8.19">and this was often done without the</text>
  <text start="873.329" dur="8.94">consent of the patient or even without</text>
  <text start="877.199" dur="11.1">their knowledge so this is a big deal</text>
  <text start="882.269" dur="11.63">because again it&amp;#39;s not about doing</text>
  <text start="888.299" dur="9.871">abortions because it is beneficial for</text>
  <text start="893.899" dur="7.571">the mother it&amp;#39;s not about women&amp;#39;s rights</text>
  <text start="898.17" dur="6.479">it&amp;#39;s not about that it&amp;#39;s about them</text>
  <text start="901.47" dur="6.289">making money off of the products because</text>
  <text start="904.649" dur="6.06">that&amp;#39;s what it really is to them they</text>
  <text start="907.759" dur="6.101">extract that product and the more intact</text>
  <text start="910.709" dur="4.98">that fetus is the more money they can</text>
  <text start="913.86" dur="4.56">get and that&amp;#39;s what was revealed in</text>
  <text start="915.689" dur="4.471">these undercover videos and there was 15</text>
  <text start="918.42" dur="4.129">videos and that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re facing the</text>
  <text start="920.16" dur="6.509">15 felony charges</text>
  <text start="922.549" dur="6.85">so in this hearing</text>
  <text start="926.669" dur="6.181">they had come out that they had no ban</text>
  <text start="929.399" dur="5.011">against altering these procedures so</text>
  <text start="932.85" dur="3.12">that would be an altering of a procedure</text>
  <text start="934.41" dur="6.509">because you&amp;#39;re not supposed to do it</text>
  <text start="935.97" dur="12.419">that way but they were doing it that way</text>
  <text start="940.919" dur="11.431">to benefits the business of harvesting</text>
  <text start="948.389" dur="6.89">baby body parts and the more intact the</text>
  <text start="952.35" dur="5.1">more money it would bring in</text>
  <text start="955.279" dur="6.721">so these are the things that are being</text>
  <text start="957.45" dur="10.439">revealed throughout this hearing and yet</text>
  <text start="962" dur="9.93">the media is focusing on the fact that</text>
  <text start="967.889" dur="4.041">Planned Parenthood is under attack</text>
  <text start="974.36" dur="12.24">this hearing this case has me so</text>
  <text start="981.29" dur="8.53">infuriated because people are so asleep</text>
  <text start="986.6" dur="6.549">that they do not even recognize that</text>
  <text start="989.82" dur="6.18">Planned Parenthood themselves in a court</text>
  <text start="993.149" dur="9.111">hearing have admitted to harvesting</text>
  <text start="996" dur="9.99">babies for profits and that they</text>
  <text start="1002.26" dur="8.62">manipulated the law in order to try to</text>
  <text start="1005.99" dur="6.45">protect themselves so for example they</text>
  <text start="1010.88" dur="6.81">wanted to make the distinction between</text>
  <text start="1012.44" dur="7.889">method and technique method and</text>
  <text start="1017.69" dur="7.139">technique are the same thing</text>
  <text start="1020.329" dur="8.701">there are synonyms it it&amp;#39;s really just a</text>
  <text start="1024.829" dur="10.441">change in the word that you use they</text>
  <text start="1029.03" dur="9.299">mean exactly the same thing because they</text>
  <text start="1035.27" dur="5.58">were saying that the law says that it</text>
  <text start="1038.329" dur="4.86">stipulates a doctor cannot change the</text>
  <text start="1040.85" dur="3.93">method of a medical procedure without a</text>
  <text start="1043.189" dur="3.031">patient&amp;#39;s consent so that&amp;#39;s what the law</text>
  <text start="1044.78" dur="5.76">says right so they&amp;#39;re breaking the law</text>
  <text start="1046.22" dur="5.88">by turning a baby a fetus a baby because</text>
  <text start="1050.54" dur="5.91">that&amp;#39;s what the fetus is it&amp;#39;s a baby</text>
  <text start="1052.1" dur="6.78">it&amp;#39;s a person turning the baby breech so</text>
  <text start="1056.45" dur="7.89">that they can obtain a full specimen for</text>
  <text start="1058.88" dur="8.16">sale without consent without knowledge a</text>
  <text start="1064.34" dur="7.29">lot of the times they don&amp;#39;t even tell</text>
  <text start="1067.04" dur="6.03">these patients these women why because</text>
  <text start="1071.63" dur="3.45">they don&amp;#39;t want to say oh yeah we</text>
  <text start="1073.07" dur="9.239">pressured you into doing this because we</text>
  <text start="1075.08" dur="10.31">want to make money off of your baby so</text>
  <text start="1082.309" dur="4.981">to get around the law they</text>
  <text start="1085.39" dur="2.71">differentiated between method and</text>
  <text start="1087.29" dur="8.249">technique or</text>
  <text start="1088.1" dur="12.48">supposedly they did those words mean the</text>
  <text start="1095.539" dur="9.571">same thing that does not exempt you from</text>
  <text start="1100.58" dur="6.54">accountability by changing a word we all</text>
  <text start="1105.11" dur="13.26">know that method and technique are the</text>
  <text start="1107.12" dur="13.679">same so this is a big deal all of this</text>
  <text start="1118.37" dur="4.62">information is being revealed in this</text>
  <text start="1120.799" dur="6.661">hearing against these investigative</text>
  <text start="1122.99" dur="7.2">reporters but nobody cares the media</text>
  <text start="1127.46" dur="9.57">doesn&amp;#39;t care about it and not only that</text>
  <text start="1130.19" dur="9.239">but apparently we still have people who</text>
  <text start="1137.03" dur="3.54">are coming out and support of Planned</text>
  <text start="1139.429" dur="3.301">Parenthood because of course we have</text>
  <text start="1140.57" dur="3.45">clinics that are shutting down I talked</text>
  <text start="1142.73" dur="3.42">about that yesterday with the two that</text>
  <text start="1144.02" dur="7.13">are shutting down in Ohio so groups had</text>
  <text start="1146.15" dur="14.46">come out and protested this shutdown I</text>
  <text start="1151.15" dur="12.55">don&amp;#39;t understand why why are they still</text>
  <text start="1160.61" dur="5.699">supporting this organization they are</text>
  <text start="1163.7" dur="7.229">now being proven in court by their own</text>
  <text start="1166.309" dur="11.791">admission that they sell baby parts that</text>
  <text start="1170.929" dur="8.791">they harvest baby parts this is how</text>
  <text start="1178.1" dur="3.54">asleep people are and I was talking</text>
  <text start="1179.72" dur="5.579">about this yesterday that people are</text>
  <text start="1181.64" dur="4.98">just asleep or not yesterday a couple</text>
  <text start="1185.299" dur="4.171">days ago excuse me</text>
  <text start="1186.62" dur="8.96">but that&amp;#39;s besides the point the point</text>
  <text start="1189.47" dur="8.49">is these people are so invested in this</text>
  <text start="1195.58" dur="6.25">illusion that Planned Parenthood is</text>
  <text start="1197.96" dur="8.13">somehow a benevolent organization that</text>
  <text start="1201.83" dur="6.51">wants to preserve women&amp;#39;s rights because</text>
  <text start="1206.09" dur="4.829">anytime you put rights at the end of</text>
  <text start="1208.34" dur="6.06">anything it&amp;#39;s automatically a benevolent</text>
  <text start="1210.919" dur="7.221">organization oh we&amp;#39;re here working for</text>
  <text start="1214.4" dur="7.31">human rights like the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="1218.14" dur="7.65">one of the most evil organizations on</text>
  <text start="1221.71" dur="7.58">this planet today because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1225.79" dur="10.139">working on human rights civil rights</text>
  <text start="1229.29" dur="9.7">women&amp;#39;s rights transgender rights that</text>
  <text start="1235.929" dur="5.391">automatically if you put rights at the</text>
  <text start="1238.99" dur="10.98">end of something that makes it good</text>
  <text start="1241.32" dur="12.55">that&amp;#39;s how unaware this public is I mean</text>
  <text start="1249.97" dur="6.06">really you don&amp;#39;t get any more obvious</text>
  <text start="1253.87" dur="6">than this when you have an organization</text>
  <text start="1256.03" dur="5.34">in court admitting to something that</text>
  <text start="1259.87" dur="10.77">they&amp;#39;ve been accused of and the public</text>
  <text start="1261.37" dur="15.86">still supports them additionally they</text>
  <text start="1270.64" dur="12.36">apparently also are working to oppose a</text>
  <text start="1277.23" dur="9.37">legislative ban on child marriage now</text>
  <text start="1283" dur="10.71">why do you think that is let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1286.6" dur="14.4">think about that because who is going to</text>
  <text start="1293.71" dur="10.62">be a likely customer for an abortion</text>
  <text start="1301" dur="6.45">procedure perhaps a child having a child</text>
  <text start="1304.33" dur="4.979">a child who is not ready to raise</text>
  <text start="1307.45" dur="6.349">another child because they themselves</text>
  <text start="1309.309" dur="4.49">are too immature for that responsibility</text>
  <text start="1314.04" dur="6.97">or a child who&amp;#39;s too impressionable and</text>
  <text start="1318.13" dur="7.26">they&amp;#39;re easily coerced into getting an</text>
  <text start="1321.01" dur="10.26">abortion if they&amp;#39;re pregnant by some man</text>
  <text start="1325.39" dur="9.18">who is decades older than them so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1331.27" dur="9">they&amp;#39;re all working together to push</text>
  <text start="1334.57" dur="10.17">these agendas so this should not be a</text>
  <text start="1340.27" dur="7.59">surprise because Ruth Bader Ginsburg for</text>
  <text start="1344.74" dur="4.4">example was trying to push this idea</text>
  <text start="1347.86" dur="3.68">that</text>
  <text start="1349.14" dur="9.3">the age of consent should be lowered to</text>
  <text start="1351.54" dur="9.81">twelve and in this case opponents to</text>
  <text start="1358.44" dur="4.05">legislation that would ban child</text>
  <text start="1361.35" dur="3.87">marriage they&amp;#39;re saying that there</text>
  <text start="1362.49" dur="13.38">should be no age limit on when a person</text>
  <text start="1365.22" dur="15.75">should get married this is bad because</text>
  <text start="1375.87" dur="8.1">younger individuals who end up getting</text>
  <text start="1380.97" dur="7.35">married whether it&amp;#39;s under pressure or</text>
  <text start="1383.97" dur="10.68">whatever the case may be they are more</text>
  <text start="1388.32" dur="11.55">prone to abuse they are vulnerable to</text>
  <text start="1394.65" dur="7.71">abuse and not only that but apparently</text>
  <text start="1399.87" dur="5.73">so when I found this article and I was</text>
  <text start="1402.36" dur="5.97">reading into this apparently it also</text>
  <text start="1405.6" dur="8.85">talked about how Planned Parenthood had</text>
  <text start="1408.33" dur="10.07">been guilty of covering up child rape so</text>
  <text start="1414.45" dur="6.27">when you go over to this article here</text>
  <text start="1418.4" dur="5.62">Planned Parenthood caught covering up</text>
  <text start="1420.72" dur="7.339">child rape in Philadelphia so they did</text>
  <text start="1424.02" dur="9.57">not report when minors would come in</text>
  <text start="1428.059" dur="9.461">ages fourteen thirteen twelve eleven to</text>
  <text start="1433.59" dur="11.04">get abortions that doesn&amp;#39;t send up a red</text>
  <text start="1437.52" dur="9.6">flag to you really so they had said this</text>
  <text start="1444.63" dur="5.49">about it they said statutory sexual</text>
  <text start="1447.12" dur="4.65">assaults statutory rape is a sexual</text>
  <text start="1450.12" dur="3.24">intercourse when one person is under the</text>
  <text start="1451.77" dur="4.289">age of sixteen and the other is four or</text>
  <text start="1453.36" dur="6.84">more years older it is a crime however</text>
  <text start="1456.059" dur="6.771">it is a it is not a mandated reportable</text>
  <text start="1460.2" dur="7.859">incident what do you mean it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="1462.83" dur="6.76">mandated reportable incident it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1468.059" dur="3.631">crime but you don&amp;#39;t have to report it</text>
  <text start="1469.59" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s a crime against a child but you</text>
  <text start="1471.69" dur="8.369">don&amp;#39;t have to report it and apparently</text>
  <text start="1474.75" dur="7.82">in a lot of these cases they had allowed</text>
  <text start="1480.059" dur="4.711">the abuse to continue because they</text>
  <text start="1482.57" dur="3.25">didn&amp;#39;t report it at all and then they</text>
  <text start="1484.77" dur="4.53">just hand it over</text>
  <text start="1485.82" dur="13.53">this young individual 13 14 12 however</text>
  <text start="1489.3" dur="15">old back to their abuser this is bad</text>
  <text start="1499.35" dur="9.51">and so apparently there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="1504.3" dur="6.72">cases where these abusers will bring in</text>
  <text start="1508.86" dur="5.97">these children because that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="1511.02" dur="6.63">are to have these procedures done these</text>
  <text start="1514.83" dur="5.76">abortions so then they can continue to</text>
  <text start="1517.65" dur="6.84">abuse them and Planned Parenthood never</text>
  <text start="1520.59" dur="5.85">said a thing why cuz it&amp;#39;s good business</text>
  <text start="1524.49" dur="8.37">for them they still make money off of it</text>
  <text start="1526.44" dur="8.67">so another thing that&amp;#39;s interesting is</text>
  <text start="1532.86" dur="4.26">Billie islets show Billie Eilish is the</text>
  <text start="1535.11" dur="5.31">next hottest thing right now so she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1537.12" dur="5.19">this new hot celebrity in music and so</text>
  <text start="1540.42" dur="5.19">she&amp;#39;s come out saying that she&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1542.31" dur="6.21">to donate her earnings a portion of it</text>
  <text start="1545.61" dur="5.16">anyway to Planned Parenthood now this is</text>
  <text start="1548.52" dur="5.46">a very big deal and it&amp;#39;s part of the</text>
  <text start="1550.77" dur="7.74">hashtag bans off my body campaign we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1553.98" dur="7.44">over a hundred and forty one artists who</text>
  <text start="1558.51" dur="6.57">had signed on to billboards band</text>
  <text start="1561.42" dur="5.46">together bands off ad so and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1565.08" dur="3.87">part of Planned Parenthood&amp;#39;s bands off</text>
  <text start="1566.88" dur="4.05">my body campaign so billboard and</text>
  <text start="1568.95" dur="4.29">Planned Parenthood have partnered</text>
  <text start="1570.93" dur="5.22">together now this is not a surprise to</text>
  <text start="1573.24" dur="6.15">me since celebrities are often used to</text>
  <text start="1576.15" dur="7.97">push an agenda now when I looked into</text>
  <text start="1579.39" dur="7.77">this a little bit further billboard is</text>
  <text start="1584.12" dur="5.83">connected to the Clinton Global</text>
  <text start="1587.16" dur="5.25">Initiative is that really a surprise and</text>
  <text start="1589.95" dur="5.55">they have been for quite some time now</text>
  <text start="1592.41" dur="8.76">and so this is an interesting article</text>
  <text start="1595.5" dur="7.17">from back in 2016 and it&amp;#39;s titled how</text>

  <text start="1606.21" dur="5.52">I call it a narrative push and in fact</text>
  <text start="1609.27" dur="6.15">they even themselves call it that here</text>
  <text start="1611.73" dur="4.62">in this article so let me just try to</text>
  <text start="1615.42" dur="7.739">find</text>
  <text start="1616.35" dur="9.03">where they had said that okay so they</text>
  <text start="1623.159" dur="4.77">start talking about this and so Craig</text>

  <text start="1627.929" dur="3.09">name the Clinton Foundation&amp;#39;s chief</text>
  <text start="1629.19" dur="3.3">communications officer had said quote</text>
  <text start="1631.019" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s important to President Clinton and</text>
  <text start="1632.49" dur="4.26">Chelsea that we put the maximum amount</text>
  <text start="1634.799" dur="4.11">of resources into running the programs</text>
  <text start="1636.75" dur="3.6">and doing the charitable work that means</text>
  <text start="1638.909" dur="3.12">being creative about how we spread</text>
  <text start="1640.35" dur="3.99">awareness which is one of the reasons we</text>
  <text start="1642.029" dur="4.831">try to find creative ways to work with</text>
  <text start="1644.34" dur="4.319">the entertainment industry to highlight</text>
  <text start="1646.86" dur="3.36">that work end quote</text>
  <text start="1648.659" dur="4.35">and of course this was back when Bill</text>
  <text start="1650.22" dur="6.27">Clinton was the president so it also</text>
  <text start="1653.009" dur="4.741">says that there are stars like Brad Pitt</text>
  <text start="1656.49" dur="3.72">or Alicia Keys who have their own</text>
  <text start="1657.75" dur="4.44">charities and know that by promoting</text>

  <text start="1663.659" dur="6.061">the foundation they can maximize their</text>

  <text start="1671.639" dur="4.111">the foundation and its work as plot</text>
  <text start="1673.83" dur="4.41">points because they make sense than the</text>
  <text start="1675.75" dur="3.75">narrative which such as when fictional</text>
  <text start="1678.24" dur="4.26">characters with political ambitions</text>

  <text start="1710.99" dur="7.419">exposing those who may not quote be</text>
  <text start="1714.029" dur="6.181">aware of their agenda they need them to</text>
  <text start="1718.409" dur="3.9">be aware of this certain narrative this</text>
  <text start="1720.21" dur="7.679">is how they push that narrative through</text>
  <text start="1722.309" dur="7.921">the entertainment industry and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1727.889" dur="4.051">interesting that television is called</text>
  <text start="1730.23" dur="2.09">programming because really that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1731.94" dur="6.119">it is</text>
  <text start="1732.32" dur="8.02">social programming so in the case of</text>
  <text start="1738.059" dur="4.911">planned parenthood this is not a</text>
  <text start="1740.34" dur="6.209">surprise that they would pair up with</text>
  <text start="1742.97" dur="6.01">billboard in order to push this message</text>
  <text start="1746.549" dur="3.521">to supports Planned Parenthood and to</text>
  <text start="1748.98" dur="3.34">talk about how</text>
  <text start="1750.07" dur="7.67">and it&amp;#39;s hack on Planned Parenthood is</text>
  <text start="1752.32" dur="10.77">an attack on women&amp;#39;s rights this is</text>
  <text start="1757.74" dur="8.65">their method to try to justify Planned</text>
  <text start="1763.09" dur="6.15">Parenthood&amp;#39;s actions and to make it</text>
  <text start="1766.39" dur="4.89">appear that Planned Parenthood is</text>
  <text start="1769.24" dur="11.55">working for the benefit of women when</text>
  <text start="1771.28" dur="13.8">they are not they are not and all of</text>
  <text start="1780.79" dur="10.98">these industries really are working</text>
  <text start="1785.08" dur="12.27">together they are connected think about</text>
  <text start="1791.77" dur="8.49">that so I&amp;#39;ll be following this story</text>
  <text start="1797.35" dur="5.94">really closely I have been for a little</text>
  <text start="1800.26" dur="5.67">bit now because this is important this</text>
  <text start="1803.29" dur="5.31">is really important number one the</text>
  <text start="1805.93" dur="8.18">public needs to realize that Planned</text>
  <text start="1808.6" dur="5.51">Parenthood is a dangerous organization</text>
  <text start="1814.5" dur="8.14">number two the other issue with this</text>
  <text start="1817.63" dur="7.44">case is that these two reporters if they</text>
  <text start="1822.64" dur="5.16">are prosecuted this sets a dangerous</text>
  <text start="1825.07" dur="5.49">precedent because they were exposing</text>
  <text start="1827.8" dur="6.45">truth they were exposing criminal</text>
  <text start="1830.56" dur="5.37">activity and that criminal activity is</text>
  <text start="1834.25" dur="4.44">even being detailed in this hearing</text>
  <text start="1835.93" dur="4.98">right now but the ones who are guilty of</text>
  <text start="1838.69" dur="5.61">that criminal activity are not being</text>
  <text start="1840.91" dur="6.99">prosecuted so if these reporters are</text>
  <text start="1844.3" dur="6.63">prosecuted it means that there is a</text>
  <text start="1847.9" dur="6.06">precedent where investigative journalism</text>
  <text start="1850.93" dur="5.61">dies because the purpose of</text>
  <text start="1853.96" dur="5.73">investigative journalism is to expose</text>
  <text start="1856.54" dur="8.94">criminal activity which otherwise would</text>
  <text start="1859.69" dur="7.68">not be exposed and Planned Parenthood is</text>
  <text start="1865.48" dur="4.74">a perfect example of that they have the</text>
  <text start="1867.37" dur="8.48">public completely fooled into thinking</text>
  <text start="1870.22" dur="9.27">that they are God got a godsend to</text>
  <text start="1875.85" dur="5.77">society that they work on behalf of</text>
  <text start="1879.49" dur="4.73">women and women&amp;#39;s rights and all of that</text>
  <text start="1881.62" dur="2.6">when they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1885.59" dur="11.94">they don&amp;#39;t care about human life they</text>
  <text start="1889.95" dur="7.58">work to line their pockets and really</text>
  <text start="1898.16" dur="10">these babies that are harvested are used</text>
  <text start="1903.75" dur="11.61">for much more devious ends than even</text>
  <text start="1908.16" dur="12.899">this case is letting on but this is</text>
  <text start="1915.36" dur="8.73">dangerous these investigative reporters</text>
  <text start="1921.059" dur="6.861">cannot be prosecuted for this if they</text>
  <text start="1924.09" dur="7.95">are it sets a dangerous precedent and</text>
  <text start="1927.92" dur="11.38">also at the same time the public needs</text>
  <text start="1932.04" dur="13.32">to know that this is happening so while</text>
  <text start="1939.3" dur="10.58">there is a campaign to support Planned</text>
  <text start="1945.36" dur="8.31">Parenthood as a benevolent organization</text>
  <text start="1949.88" dur="6.34">we need to be campaigning hard against</text>
  <text start="1953.67" dur="4.38">Planned Parenthood exposing what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1956.22" dur="12.959">doing to every single person who will</text>
  <text start="1958.05" dur="18.96">listen because this cannot stand this is</text>
  <text start="1969.179" dur="9.661">not okay and also it&amp;#39;s likely the</text>
  <text start="1977.01" dur="4.98">abortion industry is very tightly</text>
  <text start="1978.84" dur="12.06">connected to the elite human trafficking</text>
  <text start="1981.99" dur="13.86">network they all work together all right</text>
  <text start="1990.9" dur="7.26">in other news so now of course it has</text>
  <text start="1995.85" dur="4.11">been exposed that of course we already</text>
  <text start="1998.16" dur="5.519">knew this we already knew that Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="1999.96" dur="5.28">Epstein was taking minors to Peto Island</text>
  <text start="2003.679" dur="6.421">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s called pedo island but</text>
  <text start="2005.24" dur="7.65">now it&amp;#39;s come out that the u.s. marshals</text>
  <text start="2010.1" dur="6.26">had gained testimony from air traffic</text>
  <text start="2012.89" dur="3.47">controllers that this was happening</text>
  <text start="2016.78" dur="7.09">so US Marshals are involved in the</text>
  <text start="2020.179" dur="5.281">investigation into Epstein and this is</text>
  <text start="2023.87" dur="4.559">also important and kind of intriguing</text>
  <text start="2025.46" dur="5.82">because the US Marshals are also at the</text>
  <text start="2028.429" dur="5.581">head of the u.s. witness protection</text>
  <text start="2031.28" dur="3.33">program so that&amp;#39;s really an interesting</text>
  <text start="2034.01" dur="2.52">point</text>
  <text start="2034.61" dur="5.49">now also in relation to this of course</text>
  <text start="2036.53" dur="5.34">this is no surprise so right now we have</text>
  <text start="2040.1" dur="5.79">very prominent individuals who are</text>
  <text start="2041.87" dur="10.289">coming out in defense of pedophilia</text>
  <text start="2045.89" dur="10.56">in defense of the crimes that I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="2052.159" dur="7.74">had committed and also anyone who was</text>
  <text start="2056.45" dur="6.3">connected to him financially or</text>
  <text start="2059.899" dur="5.371">otherwise so first up we have a Harvard</text>
  <text start="2062.75" dur="4.53">professor who says if you take Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2065.27" dur="4.109">money do it in secret so he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="2067.28" dur="3.75">that yeah you know we take money from a</text>
  <text start="2069.379" dur="3.451">lot of different people sometimes people</text>
  <text start="2071.03" dur="3.99">who don&amp;#39;t really necessarily do good</text>
  <text start="2072.83" dur="3.87">things maybe we are aware that they are</text>
  <text start="2075.02" dur="3.659">involved in criminal activity but we</text>
  <text start="2076.7" dur="3.33">take their money anyway so if you want</text>
  <text start="2078.679" dur="3.74">to save yourself a lot of trouble then</text>
  <text start="2080.03" dur="5.07">just make sure that you do it secretly</text>
  <text start="2082.419" dur="6.541">really so he&amp;#39;s trying to make light of</text>
  <text start="2085.1" dur="6.18">this situation why because at this point</text>
  <text start="2088.96" dur="4.03">those who have tried to distance</text>
  <text start="2091.28" dur="3.359">themselves from Epstein are having a</text>
  <text start="2092.99" dur="5.3">hard time of doing that that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="2094.639" dur="8.131">had the MIT exec he had to step down</text>
  <text start="2098.29" dur="7.84">including the guy who called for the</text>
  <text start="2102.77" dur="5.04">independent investigation because of</text>
  <text start="2106.13" dur="3.93">course sometimes when you call for an</text>
  <text start="2107.81" dur="4.11">independent investigation you think oh</text>
  <text start="2110.06" dur="3.39">well it makes it look like I&amp;#39;m innocent</text>
  <text start="2111.92" dur="4.59">because I&amp;#39;m the one calling for the</text>
  <text start="2113.45" dur="6.24">investigation not realizing that oh yeah</text>
  <text start="2116.51" dur="5.76">by the way your influence is not going</text>
  <text start="2119.69" dur="4.169">to protect you anymore now if we find</text>
  <text start="2122.27" dur="3.45">something on you guess what you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="2123.859" dur="6.781">to be held accountable so now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2125.72" dur="7.02">calling for him to step down as well so</text>
  <text start="2130.64" dur="4.95">as people are finding it harder and</text>
  <text start="2132.74" dur="4.53">harder to distance themselves from</text>
  <text start="2135.59" dur="6">Epstein now they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="2137.27" dur="10.05">justify it they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="2141.59" dur="7.41">normalize it so that&amp;#39;s what this Harvard</text>
  <text start="2147.32" dur="6.39">professor is trying to do</text>
  <text start="2149" dur="7.38">now also we have one of the very</text>
  <text start="2153.71" dur="5.46">prominent scientist so he was highly</text>
  <text start="2156.38" dur="5.94">renowned he had several awards and</text>
  <text start="2159.17" dur="7.2">recognitions so he was a computer</text>
  <text start="2162.32" dur="7.26">technology researcher and so he has come</text>
  <text start="2166.37" dur="6.9">out and defended Epstein and in an email</text>
  <text start="2169.58" dur="6.21">he was saying that it&amp;#39;s likely the</text>
  <text start="2173.27" dur="4.41">victims were entirely willing and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2175.79" dur="4.31">the most plausible explanation that they</text>
  <text start="2177.68" dur="7.08">were more than willing to do it</text>
  <text start="2180.1" dur="7.36">speaking about Virginia Roberts Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="2184.76" dur="6.84">or anyone else who was abused by Epstein</text>
  <text start="2187.46" dur="6.12">and his associates that they were</text>
  <text start="2191.6" dur="5.37">willing participants now this is also a</text>
  <text start="2193.58" dur="6.84">man who for the past 15 years or so has</text>
  <text start="2196.97" dur="5.22">really tried to make light of pedophilia</text>
  <text start="2200.42" dur="5.01">he&amp;#39;s trying to normalize it saying that</text>
  <text start="2202.19" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s a normal thing he&amp;#39;s said several</text>
  <text start="2205.43" dur="6.21">very controversial statements and yet</text>
  <text start="2207.83" dur="9.03">this is still a person who has a job</text>
  <text start="2211.64" dur="8.85">within a prominent university his</text>
  <text start="2216.86" dur="8.81">opinions his view on pedophilia is quite</text>
  <text start="2220.49" dur="8.04">public has been so for many years and</text>
  <text start="2225.67" dur="9.94">yet he still has a very prominent</text>
  <text start="2228.53" dur="10.26">position so one of his writings he said</text>
  <text start="2235.61" dur="5.25">that it is morally absurd to define rape</text>
  <text start="2238.79" dur="3.6">in a way that depends on minor details</text>
  <text start="2240.86" dur="3.3">such as which country it was in or</text>
  <text start="2242.39" dur="3.74">whether the victim was 18 years old or</text>
  <text start="2244.16" dur="4.41">17 end quote</text>
  <text start="2246.13" dur="7.41">but that&amp;#39;s not even the worst of what he</text>
  <text start="2248.57" dur="7.77">said so he also said this he said quote</text>
  <text start="2253.54" dur="4.57">this child pornography might be a photo</text>
  <text start="2256.34" dur="3.15">of yourself or your lover that the two</text>
  <text start="2258.11" dur="3.72">of you shared it might be an image of</text>
  <text start="2259.49" dur="3.75">sexually mature teenager that any normal</text>
  <text start="2261.83" dur="3.36">adult would find attractive</text>
  <text start="2263.24" dur="4.65">what&amp;#39;s heinous about having a photo end</text>
  <text start="2265.19" dur="5.79">quote talking about having pornographic</text>
  <text start="2267.89" dur="4.8">images of teenagers and how that should</text>
  <text start="2270.98" dur="9.82">be it&amp;#39;s okay and that it&amp;#39;s perfectly</text>
  <text start="2272.69" dur="12.2">normal so once again we have highly</text>
  <text start="2280.8" dur="7.72">regarded individuals making statements</text>
  <text start="2284.89" dur="7.38">that attempt to normalize something that</text>
  <text start="2288.52" dur="8.7">should be wrong morally wrong like</text>
  <text start="2292.27" dur="7.47">pedophilia and then in another statement</text>
  <text start="2297.22" dur="4.17">he said I disagree with some of what the</text>
  <text start="2299.74" dur="3.72">article says about epsteen epsteen is</text>

  <text start="2387.19" dur="5.58">names it&amp;#39;s likely that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2390.97" dur="3.6">find some of these individuals in there</text>
  <text start="2392.77" dur="3.75">so what they&amp;#39;re going to try to do is</text>
  <text start="2394.57" dur="5.519">they&amp;#39;re going to try to normalize this</text>
  <text start="2396.52" dur="7.589">idea of pedophilia and that it should</text>
  <text start="2400.089" dur="6.801">not really be considered criminal or</text>
  <text start="2404.109" dur="2.781">morally wrong</text>
  <text start="2409.41" dur="8.55">this is the direction they&amp;#39;re taking all</text>
  <text start="2415.62" dur="5.25">right in other news finally I want to</text>
  <text start="2417.96" dur="5.46">talk about just really briefly so the</text>
  <text start="2420.87" dur="6.15">red flag laws of course this has been a</text>
  <text start="2423.42" dur="5.43">major issue recently where virtually</text>
  <text start="2427.02" dur="5.36">every Democrat is calling for red flag</text>
  <text start="2428.85" dur="6.51">laws if not an entire ban on weapons</text>
  <text start="2432.38" dur="5.86">overall like Joe Biden talking about</text>
  <text start="2435.36" dur="5.7">wanting to ban magazines with multiple</text>
  <text start="2438.24" dur="7.02">rounds which I mean really he&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="2441.06" dur="7.14">about virtually every gun so apparently</text>
  <text start="2445.26" dur="4.71">they had just passed in the house a new</text>
  <text start="2448.2" dur="5.52">measure that encourages States to pass</text>
  <text start="2449.97" dur="5.91">red flag laws known as extreme risk</text>
  <text start="2453.72" dur="3.69">protection orders that authorize</text>
  <text start="2455.88" dur="5.97">removing guns and ammunition from</text>
  <text start="2457.41" dur="8.04">dangerous individuals now a Colorado</text>
  <text start="2461.85" dur="10.62">Republican had tried to enter in an</text>
  <text start="2465.45" dur="8.73">amendment where it would also issue red</text>
  <text start="2472.47" dur="5.28">flag order against anyone whose name</text>
  <text start="2474.18" dur="5.04">appears in a gang database if there is</text>
  <text start="2477.75" dur="4.14">probable cause to include that</text>
  <text start="2479.22" dur="6.3">individual in the database so Democrats</text>
  <text start="2481.89" dur="6.27">have pushed back against that so they</text>
  <text start="2485.52" dur="5.79">they say that that should not be</text>
  <text start="2488.16" dur="5.79">included but why if you&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="2491.31" dur="4.71">red flag laws about how it&amp;#39;s common</text>
  <text start="2493.95" dur="3.87">sense because it removes guns from a</text>
  <text start="2496.02" dur="7.62">potentially dangerous individual why</text>
  <text start="2497.82" dur="9.21">would you not include gang members so</text>
  <text start="2503.64" dur="9.27">really that completely negates their</text>
  <text start="2507.03" dur="11.87">argument for red flag gun laws because</text>
  <text start="2512.91" dur="10.67">if you cannot include those who are</text>
  <text start="2518.9" dur="9.93">proven to be dangerous then your</text>
  <text start="2523.58" dur="5.25">argument for red flag is null and void</text>
  <text start="2532.01" dur="3">so</text>
  <text start="2535.44" dur="11.54">this just proves that their purpose of</text>
  <text start="2542.359" dur="14.25">enacting a red flag gun law is not to</text>
  <text start="2546.98" dur="12.49">remove the threat of gun violence from a</text>
  <text start="2556.609" dur="10.421">dangerous individual but it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2559.47" dur="10.71">just to remove the guns because it</text>
  <text start="2567.03" dur="6.9">leaves anyone vulnerable to an</text>
  <text start="2570.18" dur="7.95">accusation against them that may not</text>
  <text start="2573.93" dur="5.97">even have any basis whatsoever but then</text>
  <text start="2578.13" dur="9.75">that can result in that person having</text>
  <text start="2579.9" dur="10.08">their guns removed confiscated has</text>
  <text start="2587.88" dur="5.159">nothing to do with wanting to prevent</text>
  <text start="2589.98" dur="5.94">violence has everything to do with just</text>
