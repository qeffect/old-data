  <text start="1634.83" dur="6.63">it for now and then finally I want to</text>
  <text start="1638.37" dur="5.4">bring your attention to Ron Paul this</text>
  <text start="1641.46" dur="5.69">article is forget Russia gate look at</text>
  <text start="1643.77" dur="3.38">FBI gate instead</text>
  <text start="1651.3" dur="6.12">so he says hopefully this will end at</text>
  <text start="1655.65" dur="4.59">all because Mueller did not have any</text>
  <text start="1657.42" dur="4.05">evidence I think we should never use the</text>
  <text start="1660.24" dur="4.4">word Russian gate again</text>
  <text start="1661.47" dur="5.46">I think we ought to use the FBI gate</text>
  <text start="1664.64" dur="6.1">because there was a conspiracy to try to</text>
  <text start="1666.93" dur="6.03">frame Trump let&amp;#39;s cross live now to Ron</text>
  <text start="1670.74" dur="4.29">Paul former US congressman to discuss</text>
  <text start="1672.96" dur="3.21">this further mr. Paul welcome to the</text>
  <text start="1675.03" dur="3.54">program it&amp;#39;s good to have you with us</text>
  <text start="1676.17" dur="4.14">now the full report was released already</text>
  <text start="1678.57" dur="3.6">and Robert Muller was sticking to the</text>
  <text start="1680.31" dur="3.45">document during the hearing he still is</text>
  <text start="1682.17" dur="3.78">what are the Democrats hoping to achieve</text>
  <text start="1683.76" dur="8.91">here is there any point in these</text>
  <text start="1685.95" dur="9.57">hearings well maybe maybe yeah hopefully</text>
  <text start="1692.67" dur="5.16">this will end it all because Muller</text>
  <text start="1695.52" dur="4.32">didn&amp;#39;t have any evidence I think we</text>
  <text start="1697.83" dur="4.32">should never use the word Russia gate</text>
  <text start="1699.84" dur="4.71">again I think we ought to use the FBI</text>
  <text start="1702.15" dur="6.6">gate because there was a conspiracy to</text>
  <text start="1704.55" dur="6.87">try to frame Trump and I think this</text>
  <text start="1708.75" dur="5.13">whole thing today that was geared to try</text>
  <text start="1711.42" dur="4.56">to start impeachment process against</text>
  <text start="1713.88" dur="3.96">Trump I think it&amp;#39;s totally failed so I</text>
  <text start="1715.98" dur="3.24">don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s going to happen I</text>
  <text start="1717.84" dur="3.48">think the Democrats are going to be very</text>
  <text start="1719.22" dur="6.03">unhappy with the way things are going</text>
  <text start="1721.32" dur="5.88">but the one thing for sure is most</text>
  <text start="1725.25" dur="4.56">everything we&amp;#39;ve heard today as we have</text>
  <text start="1727.2" dur="4.89">for two years or more has been all about</text>
  <text start="1729.81" dur="4.08">politics and there&amp;#39;s been very little</text>
  <text start="1732.09" dur="4.26">bit can little concern about true</text>
  <text start="1733.89" dur="4.53">justice there&amp;#39;s been a lot of injustice</text>
  <text start="1736.35" dur="3.77">going on here but fortunately there are</text>
  <text start="1738.42" dur="4.35">still some hearings going on</text>
  <text start="1740.12" dur="4.3">investigations going on to find out in</text>
  <text start="1742.77" dur="4.62">detail exactly how this all got started</text>
  <text start="1744.42" dur="5.04">who was responsible and who really was</text>
  <text start="1747.39" dur="4.08">telling the truth why do you think</text>
  <text start="1749.46" dur="4.05">Muller was struggling to answer some</text>
  <text start="1751.47" dur="3.9">questions about the key contents of his</text>
  <text start="1753.51" dur="3.6">own report today he even got confused</text>
  <text start="1755.37" dur="8.61">about the definition of the crime he was</text>
  <text start="1757.11" dur="9.18">investigating yeah I was even surprised</text>
  <text start="1763.98" dur="3.99">about that I knew he&amp;#39;s shrewd and I knew</text>
  <text start="1766.29" dur="4.37">he&amp;#39;s about he&amp;#39;s testified before</text>
  <text start="1767.97" dur="5.7">Congress more than anybody else has</text>
  <text start="1770.66" dur="5.08">essentially and he&amp;#39;s an expert but he</text>
  <text start="1773.67" dur="4.2">did come across like he knew what was in</text>
  <text start="1775.74" dur="4.95">the report and there was one question</text>
  <text start="1777.87" dur="4.8">about some memo that I think it was his</text>
  <text start="1780.69" dur="4.17">press conference and he was asked did</text>
  <text start="1782.67" dur="2.58">you write that he said no so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1784.86" dur="3.42">think</text>
  <text start="1785.25" dur="6.6">that he was up to speed I think the he</text>
  <text start="1788.28" dur="6.21">is not a good defender of the conspiracy</text>
  <text start="1791.85" dur="5.21">to try to frame Trump so that&amp;#39;s why if</text>
  <text start="1794.49" dur="5.97">they have impeachment hearings next year</text>
  <text start="1797.06" dur="5.71">it is going to backfire on him just as I</text>
  <text start="1800.46" dur="5.31">think this hearing today backfires on</text>
  <text start="1802.77" dur="5.16">the Democrats and Miller also said that</text>
  <text start="1805.77" dur="4.62">he did not exonerate Donald Trump from</text>
  <text start="1807.93" dur="4.2">obstruction of justice but was that the</text>
  <text start="1810.39" dur="7.44">goal of the investigation to exonerate</text>
  <text start="1812.13" dur="9.06">the president no it wasn&amp;#39;t anything he</text>
  <text start="1817.83" dur="6.3">can&amp;#39;t really address that he can&amp;#39;t uh</text>
  <text start="1821.19" dur="5.22">you know find them guilty of anything or</text>
  <text start="1824.13" dur="3.99">recommend anything so he doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1826.41" dur="3.6">this authorities sort of like proving a</text>
  <text start="1828.12" dur="4.05">negative we didn&amp;#39;t find anything he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1830.01" dur="5.97">not guilty but that was pure politics</text>
  <text start="1832.17" dur="6.03">and you know we have to realize that the</text>
  <text start="1835.98" dur="3.81">people that he appointed it&amp;#39;s a rather</text>
  <text start="1838.2" dur="3.06">strange Republicans are totally in</text>
  <text start="1839.79" dur="4.35">charge and yet the people on this</text>
  <text start="1841.26" dur="5.07">investigation committee Mahler plus so</text>
  <text start="1844.14" dur="5.31">many others were people who work for</text>
  <text start="1846.33" dur="5.46">Clinton so it was a mess it was very</text>
  <text start="1849.45" dur="3.96">biased they never thought they would be</text>
  <text start="1851.79" dur="3.63">caught they thought at the beginning</text>
  <text start="1853.41" dur="5.52">that of course the trunk would never be</text>
  <text start="1855.42" dur="6.81">President and so they&amp;#39;re caught now and</text>
  <text start="1858.93" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re still struggling but most of the</text>
  <text start="1862.23" dur="4.14">time sometimes it takes a long time for</text>
  <text start="1864.48" dur="3.36">the real truth of these events to come</text>
  <text start="1866.37" dur="3.3">out and takes years for people to do</text>
  <text start="1867.84" dur="4.26">research and write books about it but I</text>
  <text start="1869.67" dur="4.05">think this was coming out sooner I think</text>
  <text start="1872.1" dur="4.5">next year is it going to be more</text>
  <text start="1873.72" dur="5.7">involved in improving the collusion of</text>
  <text start="1876.6" dur="5.25">the Clinton administration rather than</text>
  <text start="1879.42" dur="4.05">anything that Trump has done yeah that</text>
  <text start="1881.85" dur="2.91">was another interesting part wasn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="1883.47" dur="2.97">when mother was asked about why the</text>
  <text start="1884.76" dur="3.78">investigation didn&amp;#39;t prosecute the man</text>
  <text start="1886.44" dur="4.89">who told Papa Doble is about having dirt</text>
  <text start="1888.54" dur="3.99">on Clinton though he lied to the FBI why</text>
  <text start="1891.33" dur="5.48">do you think the Republicans want to</text>
  <text start="1892.53" dur="4.28">know the origin of the investigation</text>
  <text start="1897.68" dur="4.24">well they need to know about it and I</text>
  <text start="1900.42" dur="3.78">think the evidence there that was cited</text>
  <text start="1901.92" dur="4.05">by the congressman is that you know this</text>
  <text start="1904.2" dur="4.38">is one individual that everybody knows</text>
  <text start="1905.97" dur="4.74">lied but then they went and these other</text>
  <text start="1908.58" dur="4.41">minor characters</text>
  <text start="1910.71" dur="3.15">were and including some of the Russian</text>
  <text start="1912.99" dur="4.919">citizens</text>
  <text start="1913.86" dur="6.24">we&amp;#39;re accused of lying so it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1917.909" dur="4.321">what happens when they start telling one</text>
  <text start="1920.1" dur="3.99">lie and they have to tell more and more</text>
  <text start="1922.23" dur="4.049">sometimes it gets out of hand sometimes</text>
  <text start="1924.09" dur="6.78">it gets rather silly and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1926.279" dur="6.51">where it is but the luck agreed oh what</text>
  <text start="1930.87" dur="3.57">tangled webs we weave when first we</text>
  <text start="1932.789" dur="4.191">practice to deceive I hope you guys</text>
  <text start="1934.44" dur="5.04">didn&amp;#39;t mind that I like to hear Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="1936.98" dur="4.27">he&amp;#39;s one of my heroes the only other</text>
  <text start="1939.48" dur="4.71">politician I&amp;#39;ve ever really supported</text>
  <text start="1941.25" dur="5.19">besides our president and I think he</text>
  <text start="1944.19" dur="5.369">actually won and he had such a wide</text>
  <text start="1946.44" dur="5.609">spread it was almost like seeing Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1949.559" dur="4.74">audiences today he would fill stadiums</text>
  <text start="1952.049" dur="4.591">you know he would get crowds to turnout</text>
  <text start="1954.299" dur="4.471">enthusiastically and support him and his</text>
  <text start="1956.64" dur="3.72">opponents couldn&amp;#39;t get anybody but back</text>
  <text start="1958.77" dur="4.32">then they still had too much power and</text>
  <text start="1960.36" dur="5.61">they controlled the whole system and he</text>
  <text start="1963.09" dur="5.66">wasn&amp;#39;t the the lion that trump is you</text>
