  <text start="367.84" dur="3.09">know III fall into you and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="369.669" dur="2.641">kind of bring attention to some of the</text>
  <text start="370.93" dur="3.09">things that you were talking about like</text>
  <text start="372.31" dur="3.599">my audience don&amp;#39;t care that much for</text>
  <text start="374.02" dur="3.899">crypto currencies but I do see some</text>
  <text start="375.909" dur="4.47">potential there to to it we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="377.919" dur="3.93">to talk about crypto codes the first is</text>
  <text start="380.379" dur="4.65">to talk about what you want to talk</text>
  <text start="381.849" dur="4.921">about they care about corruption they</text>
  <text start="385.029" dur="3.901">care about kind of stopping this those</text>
  <text start="386.77" dur="5.19">the beasts otherwise so we can talk</text>
  <text start="388.93" dur="6.449">about that I&amp;#39;m comfortable talking about</text>
  <text start="391.96" dur="6.239">whatever your audience wants to listen</text>
  <text start="395.379" dur="4.741">to and so let&amp;#39;s okay let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="398.199" dur="4.231">on to more important things</text>
  <text start="400.12" dur="4.859">well as a segue just to kind of mention</text>
  <text start="402.43" dur="4.799">that I would say that you&amp;#39;re a reason</text>
  <text start="404.979" dur="3.84">for crypto and it&amp;#39;s certainly mine from</text>
  <text start="407.229" dur="3.961">my perspective is that you want to</text>
  <text start="408.819" dur="4.291">oppose corruption you want to get yes</text>
  <text start="411.19" dur="5.37">what is corruption</text>
