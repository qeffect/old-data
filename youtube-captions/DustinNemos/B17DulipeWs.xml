  <text start="19.26" dur="4.59">down to some honest truthful things</text>
  <text start="21.18" dur="4.2">talking about issues like the meme of</text>

  <text start="98.759" dur="4.89">corrupt figures or on the way out a big</text>
  <text start="101.7" dur="3.87">part of why that is and a big part of</text>
  <text start="103.649" dur="3.241">why that happened is because of the q9</text>
