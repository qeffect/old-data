  <text start="9.42" dur="6.21">one I had a lot of questions about if I</text>
  <text start="12.12" dur="6.63">said rocket cow and no I said raw cacao</text>
  <text start="15.63" dur="6.33">or as you may know it cocoa or the</text>
  <text start="18.75" dur="4.74">source being of chocolate you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="21.96" dur="5.96">kind of you can&amp;#39;t really see it very</text>
  <text start="23.49" dur="7.92">well but I buy the raw cocoa nibs and</text>
  <text start="27.92" dur="5.74">then I put them in a grinder just a food</text>
  <text start="31.41" dur="3.809">processor I grind him up and you you can</text>
  <text start="33.66" dur="3.18">make chocolate milk so you can do all</text>

  <text start="36.84" dur="4.83">will chew it up whatever it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="38.43" dur="4.5">bitter it&amp;#39;s sort of similar to a coffee</text>
  <text start="41.67" dur="3.72">bean it&amp;#39;s not something you necessarily</text>
  <text start="42.93" dur="3.78">want to just eat raw but I just grind it</text>
  <text start="45.39" dur="1.98">up and swallow like a spoon or two at a</text>
  <text start="46.71" dur="2.189">time</text>
  <text start="47.37" dur="3.06">more than an ounce could give you a</text>
  <text start="48.899" dur="3.39">migraine I&amp;#39;ve never had it but it could</text>
  <text start="50.43" dur="5.609">and it&amp;#39;s a lot better than caffeine</text>
  <text start="52.289" dur="5.401">stronger poisonous to dogs and cats but</text>
  <text start="56.039" dur="2.25">anyway that&amp;#39;s not really what this is</text>
  <text start="57.69" dur="2.49">about</text>
  <text start="58.289" dur="3.991">I wanted to mention because a lot of</text>
  <text start="60.18" dur="4.769">people keep saying will you debunk anti</text>
  <text start="62.28" dur="4.47">school or will you will you will you</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="4.231">deal with this and I&amp;#39;m like I already</text>
  <text start="66.75" dur="4.32">did guys like I used his own words to</text>
  <text start="69.18" dur="4.11">show that he was a liar and just to</text>
  <text start="71.07" dur="3.72">recap for everyone early on you can go</text>
  <text start="73.29" dur="3.45">back and look at his videos and he was</text>
  <text start="74.79" dur="4.259">talking about pacer cough as a source</text>
  <text start="76.74" dur="4.68">for the 45,000 plus sealed indictments</text>
  <text start="79.049" dur="4.801">about 5,000 a month I don&amp;#39;t know where</text>
  <text start="81.42" dur="5.64">we&amp;#39;re at right now but that&amp;#39;s the latest</text>
  <text start="83.85" dur="5.22">number was almost 46,000 and and then</text>
  <text start="87.06" dur="3.809">later on he had did a video I wish I had</text>
  <text start="89.07" dur="3.39">actually like just recorded at all he</text>
  <text start="90.869" dur="2.79">had did a video where he was saying that</text>
  <text start="92.46" dur="3.47">they were fake</text>
  <text start="93.659" dur="4.861">or he had said it on Twitter I think</text>
  <text start="95.93" dur="6.22">actually I think it was a video so he</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="5.25">was actually trying to imply that this</text>
  <text start="102.15" dur="3.8">source that he had used in the past was</text>
  <text start="103.77" dur="4.77">faked so this is you know part of what</text>
  <text start="105.95" dur="4.629">led me to challenge him to a debate and</text>
  <text start="108.54" dur="4.41">he has still not accepted he is still</text>

  <text start="119.64" dur="3.99">his audience imploded and quit donating</text>
  <text start="121.68" dur="3.81">to him he admitted that going against Q</text>
  <text start="123.63" dur="4.32">destroyed his credibility and destroyed</text>
  <text start="125.49" dur="3.93">his viewercount and yet he still moved</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="3.119">into you know it looks like he moved</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="3.569">into a nice house so I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.069" dur="2.791">going on I don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s backing in</text>

  <text start="324.84" dur="3.24">liposomal it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s up to a hundred</text>
  <text start="326.61" dur="2.97">eighty five times more absorbable</text>
  <text start="328.08" dur="3.809">because it passes through your stomach</text>
  <text start="329.58" dur="3.99">acid wrapped in a fat okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.889" dur="3.33">basically a little bubble of fat with</text>
  <text start="333.57" dur="3.149">the water and the vitamin inside and it</text>
  <text start="335.219" dur="2.971">just goes right through the stomach acid</text>
  <text start="336.719" dur="4.23">and then boom into your bloodstream into</text>
  <text start="338.19" dur="3.15">your intestines where it can do the most</text>
  <text start="340.949" dur="2.28">good</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so absorbable that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="343.229" dur="3.901">it&amp;#39;s so powerful in this stuff you can&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="361.259" dur="3.331">know I just wanted to put that out there</text>
  <text start="362.61" dur="4.109">because so many people are damaged by</text>
  <text start="364.59" dur="3.84">vaccines and and these these silver</text>
  <text start="366.719" dur="3.991">amalgams that you get in your teeth that</text>

  <text start="372.389" dur="3.9">had them all removed I went into like</text>
  <text start="374.19" dur="4.229">massive debt on it I could not afford it</text>
  <text start="376.289" dur="3.841">but I got them out of my mouth if you do</text>
  <text start="378.419" dur="5.28">not believe me all right go look up</text>

  <text start="385.74" dur="4.079">tooth with an amalgam in it under a</text>
  <text start="387.539" dur="4.321">certain kind of light I think it&amp;#39;s um I</text>
  <text start="389.819" dur="3.871">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a blacklight I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="391.86" dur="3.39">know what spectrum it was but you can</text>
  <text start="393.69" dur="5.58">see the smoke like these things</text>
  <text start="395.25" dur="5.34">constantly emit mercury vapor they show</text>
  <text start="399.27" dur="4.35">you the charts in the monkey</text>
  <text start="400.59" dur="5.19">studies where it it concentrates in your</text>
  <text start="403.62" dur="4.29">brain and your in your throat in your</text>
  <text start="405.78" dur="4.08">esophagus area in your intestines and</text>
  <text start="407.91" dur="4.14">your stomach lining and it just coats</text>
  <text start="409.86" dur="3.27">you with mercury and this stuff your</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="3.15">body can&amp;#39;t handle it</text>
  <text start="413.13" dur="3.63">it just does damage it just does damage</text>
  <text start="415.2" dur="4.29">and then you have to basically just like</text>
  <text start="416.76" dur="4.56">throw like cholesterol and fat and stuff</text>
  <text start="419.49" dur="5.13">to just try to like try to block it out</text>
  <text start="421.32" dur="5.91">so I just wanted to let you guys know</text>
  <text start="424.62" dur="4.71">this is obviously this is a variety of</text>
  <text start="427.23" dur="4.89">different things here and I can I can do</text>
  <text start="429.33" dur="5.25">a link for that liposomal glutathione if</text>
  <text start="432.12" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;d rather buy it on Amazon you know</text>
  <text start="434.58" dur="4.74">obviously it&amp;#39;s a lot more expensive that</text>
  <text start="435.96" dur="4.47">way worth it but making your own will</text>
  <text start="439.32" dur="2.58">eventually get around to doing a video</text>
  <text start="440.43" dur="3.81">about that and I hope you guys</text>
  <text start="441.9" dur="4.05">oh and let me talk about Twitter</text>
  <text start="444.24" dur="2.79">actually because I need to I need to go</text>
  <text start="445.95" dur="3.89">through some stuff because they have</text>
  <text start="447.03" dur="5.31">changed the way they&amp;#39;re doing things and</text>
