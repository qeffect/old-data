  <text start="6.569" dur="4.171">recaps of some complex issues to try to</text>
  <text start="8.76" dur="4.35">go to the best and brightest minds out</text>
  <text start="10.74" dur="4.59">there on specific topics and let you</text>
  <text start="13.11" dur="4.14">kind of get an idea of what the heck is</text>
  <text start="15.33" dur="5.01">going on and as quick as a forum as I</text>
  <text start="17.25" dur="5.64">can so I&amp;#39;ve broken these down into you</text>
  <text start="20.34" dur="4.769">know individual things and this one is</text>
  <text start="22.89" dur="5.549">going to be about the FISA and Fisk</text>

  <text start="36.18" dur="5.699">same he used to have but let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="39" dur="6.18">continue through here all right we know</text>
  <text start="41.879" dur="5.371">that the Fisk Court FISC didn&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="45.18" dur="5.94">hearing to issue the title one warrant</text>
  <text start="47.25" dur="6.09">to spy on Carter page why it wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="51.12" dur="6.06">FISC court that issued the warrant in</text>
  <text start="53.34" dur="6.78">the first place in my honest opinion or</text>
  <text start="57.18" dur="5.55">in my opinion there&amp;#39;s IMO and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="60.12" dur="5.429">IMHO so in my opinion it was Loretta</text>
  <text start="62.73" dur="5.94">Lynch AG is that the smoking gun in the</text>
  <text start="65.549" dur="6.211">FISA application read on so here he has</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="5.28">a Judicial Watch tweet in response to</text>
  <text start="71.76" dur="3.81">judicial watch&amp;#39;s FOIA lawsuit DOJ</text>
  <text start="73.95" dur="4.169">admitted that the Foreign Intelligence</text>

  <text start="82.47" dur="6.3">advisor who is the subject of four</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="6.6">faisal warrants so continuing here to we</text>
  <text start="88.77" dur="5.22">have all been assuming that only the</text>
  <text start="91.2" dur="5.25">FISC can issue FISA warrants but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="5.309">not true the AG can order surveillance</text>
  <text start="96.45" dur="9.84">without FISC approval the relevant law</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="8.941">50 US Code 1805 three quote e emergency</text>

  <text start="131.58" dur="3.63">can be obtained</text>
  <text start="133.36" dur="4.53">can with due diligence we obtained I</text>
  <text start="135.21" dur="6.91">think AG Lynch issued an emergency</text>
  <text start="137.89" dur="5.97">warrant all of the a all the AG needs is</text>
  <text start="142.12" dur="5.51">a factual basis to give the order a</text>
  <text start="143.86" dur="6.42">judge of the FISA Court must be informed</text>
  <text start="147.63" dur="5.08">either personally or through a designee</text>
  <text start="150.28" dur="4.08">and then an application made no later</text>
  <text start="152.71" dur="4.98">than seven days after the emergency</text>
  <text start="154.36" dur="4.64">order is made C B and D now check the</text>
  <text start="157.69" dur="4.74">time line</text>
  <text start="159" dur="5.59">October 21 2016 the application to spy</text>
  <text start="162.43" dur="5.64">on Carter page was made to FIS see if</text>
  <text start="164.59" dur="5.85">what I&amp;#39;ve outlined above is true Lynch</text>
  <text start="168.07" dur="6.69">made the emergency order at most at most</text>
  <text start="170.44" dur="7.019">seven days before October 15th 2016 but</text>
  <text start="174.76" dur="5.94">she needed a pretext what happened on</text>
  <text start="177.459" dur="4.891">October 7 2016 Abama formally accused</text>
  <text start="180.7" dur="6.42">Russia of meddling in the presidential</text>
  <text start="182.35" dur="7.89">election so this was in response to the</text>
  <text start="187.12" dur="6.18">DNI clapper and DHS Johnson and Obama</text>
  <text start="190.24" dur="6.99">cabinet issuing a formal statement to</text>
  <text start="193.3" dur="6.36">that effect here&amp;#39;s the joint statement 9</text>
  <text start="197.23" dur="4.44">you can find corroborating detail in the</text>
  <text start="199.66" dur="4.32">page in stronk tax as well as or steel</text>
  <text start="201.67" dur="4.2">messages start here and this is the</text>

  <text start="205.87" dur="6.119">steel conversations it&amp;#39;s just their</text>
  <text start="207.43" dur="6.15">texts so but here&amp;#39;s one I thought I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="211.989" dur="2.641">pick out two days before the application</text>
  <text start="213.58" dur="3.6">was made</text>
  <text start="214.63" dur="4.71">October 19th 2016 in the final debate</text>
  <text start="217.18" dur="5.72">Clinton accuses Trump of being Putin&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="219.34" dur="5.88">puppet she was in on the scam for sure</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="4.15">so they&amp;#39;re building this false narrative</text>
  <text start="225.22" dur="5.19">with just blatant accusations that are</text>
  <text start="227.05" dur="6.33">completely false and baseless then</text>
  <text start="230.41" dur="5.54">October 21st 2016 the DOJ and FBI make</text>
  <text start="233.38" dur="5.75">their application as required by the Act</text>
  <text start="235.95" dur="5.5">this is rubber stamped by Chief Judge</text>

  <text start="241.45" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s with an I are alive but he&amp;#39;s got it</text>
  <text start="242.709" dur="4.651">with a wife without a hearing by the way</text>
  <text start="245.68" dur="5.82">I&amp;#39;m not suggesting wrongdoing on her</text>
  <text start="247.36" dur="6.84">part more that she was hoodwinked still</text>
  <text start="251.5" dur="4.44">not right to do that but anyway it was</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="5.219">signed by a FISA judge</text>
  <text start="255.94" dur="6.93">rosemary Collier at page 83 unknown FBI</text>
  <text start="259.419" dur="7.681">Supervisory Special Agent page 54 FBI</text>
  <text start="262.87" dur="7.44">director James Comey page 63 deputy AG</text>
  <text start="267.1" dur="5.37">page 65 used to who&amp;#39;s who of all the bad</text>
  <text start="270.31" dur="4.41">guys in the end that are involved and</text>
  <text start="272.47" dur="7.86">fully redacted DOJ representative page</text>
  <text start="274.72" dur="7.74">66 wonder who that one is so 13 all</text>
  <text start="280.33" dur="4.65">something else happened on October 21st</text>
  <text start="282.46" dur="4.32">can anyone guess Admiral Rogers NSA</text>
  <text start="284.98" dur="4.71">director sick to his stomach gave the</text>
  <text start="286.78" dur="7.59">FISC a major heads-up of massive NSA</text>
  <text start="289.69" dur="8.48">FISA abuse he uncovered hmm Operation</text>
  <text start="294.37" dur="7.53">Condor all right</text>
  <text start="298.17" dur="5.32">14 to recap there was no FISC hearing</text>
  <text start="301.9" dur="3.09">for the Carter page warrant that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.49" dur="3.3">because the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="3.18">bypassed the court using a story they</text>
  <text start="306.79" dur="2.79">knew was false to issue an emergency</text>
  <text start="308.17" dur="6.33">warrant to spy on an innocent citizen</text>
  <text start="309.58" dur="7.26">and eye watering fraud question what are</text>
  <text start="314.5" dur="4.74">the chances that this that what is</text>
  <text start="316.84" dur="4.29">outlined above is in the classified FISA</text>
  <text start="319.24" dur="4.71">application answer hi</text>
  <text start="321.13" dur="4.98">by the way the same application that</text>
  <text start="323.95" dur="3.75">fake news had almost certainly higher</text>
  <text start="326.11" dur="4.65">has almost certainly had unredacted</text>
  <text start="327.7" dur="5.43">since early 2017 this is the worst crime</text>
  <text start="330.76" dur="4.32">in US history easily it&amp;#39;s an abomination</text>
  <text start="333.13" dur="3.57">a travesty a shredding of the rule of</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="3.93">law and the Constitution it&amp;#39;s worse than</text>
  <text start="336.7" dur="4.74">any of us have ever imagined possible in</text>
  <text start="339.01" dur="4.35">my opinion every one of the direct</text>
  <text start="341.44" dur="5.46">conspirators must be jailed including</text>
  <text start="343.36" dur="5.01">Obama and Clinton every single one after</text>
  <text start="346.9" dur="3.63">all these criminals almost destroyed</text>
  <text start="348.37" dur="8.34">America and while doomed they are still</text>
  <text start="350.53" dur="8.52">working hard at it right now okay then</text>
  <text start="356.71" dur="5.25">he has a credit here for Doug Ross and</text>
