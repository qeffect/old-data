  <text start="13.019" dur="5.611">he has pioneered in a way of</text>
  <text start="15.839" dur="5.371">differentiating yourself legally by the</text>
  <text start="18.63" dur="4.35">books everything from a federal citizen</text>
  <text start="21.21" dur="3.39">to a state citizen it&amp;#39;s a completely</text>
  <text start="22.98" dur="4.08">different thing and he&amp;#39;s gonna describe</text>
  <text start="24.6" dur="4.05">this for us something that I was very</text>
  <text start="27.06" dur="2.78">wary of at first because you guys you</text>
  <text start="28.65" dur="2.969">know you&amp;#39;ve heard all of these different</text>
  <text start="29.84" dur="3.67">constitutional arguments then they don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="39.809" dur="3.811">whatever tricks he&amp;#39;s using it works so</text>
  <text start="42.149" dur="3.301">Chris thank you so much for joining us</text>
  <text start="43.62" dur="4.619">and you know the floor is yours</text>
  <text start="45.45" dur="5.609">you have a very fascinating value to</text>
  <text start="48.239" dur="3.331">give us so well first of all I have no</text>
  <text start="51.059" dur="4.59">tricks</text>
  <text start="51.57" dur="6.48">okay but I there you know I hear the way</text>
  <text start="55.649" dur="6.18">that you frame it and it you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="58.05" dur="6.3">obviously not you know see that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="61.829" dur="4.11">a mindset that people just read and you</text>
  <text start="64.35" dur="3.78">you&amp;#39;ve done the research and you found</text>
  <text start="65.939" dur="3.901">the way to do it there&amp;#39;s nothing that</text>
  <text start="68.13" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m promoting that I came up with myself</text>
  <text start="69.84" dur="3.54">yeah I mean you know information is out</text>
  <text start="71.97" dur="3.87">there has been out there for a long time</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="4.559">so I don&amp;#39;t consider this is my gig in</text>
  <text start="75.84" dur="3.12">that regard you know but when you do</text>
  <text start="77.939" dur="3.331">something long enough to know you</text>
  <text start="78.96" dur="4.409">perfect your own stuff but there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="81.27" dur="3.3">of people that come before me I think of</text>
  <text start="83.369" dur="3.781">a lot of people far more intelligent</text>
  <text start="84.57" dur="5.189">than need who look at things from an</text>
  <text start="87.15" dur="6.84">amazing place I mean some of my mentors</text>
  <text start="89.759" dur="7.921">certainly Paul Mitchell who wrote the</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="5.73">federal zone excellent work you know I</text>
  <text start="97.68" dur="3.63">first came to understand anything about</text>
  <text start="99.72" dur="4.38">the state citizen from Lynne Meredith</text>
  <text start="101.31" dur="4.98">who wrote vultures and eagles clothing</text>
  <text start="104.1" dur="5.57">and and so that was the first time I</text>
  <text start="106.29" dur="6.09">learned about the state citizen and that</text>
  <text start="109.67" dur="3.85">that predates the Fourteenth Amendment</text>
  <text start="112.38" dur="3.33">which is the federal citizen</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="4.529">okay the Congress creates their citizen</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="4.769">and that&amp;#39;s subject to article 1 section</text>
  <text start="118.049" dur="4.231">8 Clause 17 that&amp;#39;s their exclusive</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="4.051">legislative authority this is where</text>
  <text start="122.28" dur="4.049">civil rights comes out of this is where</text>
  <text start="124.53" dur="3.69">because rights don&amp;#39;t come from a</text>
  <text start="126.329" dur="3.481">government rights are natural rights</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="3.36">they come from the divine or they come</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="3.08">from the creation in that regard they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="131.58" dur="4.489">there in you when you</text>
  <text start="132.89" dur="4.56">or so the idea Congress creates their</text>
  <text start="136.069" dur="2.971">citizen and gives them privileges</text>
  <text start="137.45" dur="2.49">immunise that&amp;#39;s New York I should add</text>
  <text start="139.04" dur="3.39">but sorry go ahead</text>
  <text start="139.94" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s what lets have to take a potshot uu</text>
  <text start="142.43" dur="3.15">or to open with it so New York you know</text>
  <text start="144.11" dur="2.99">you&amp;#39;re not necessarily born with all</text>
  <text start="145.58" dur="6.03">those rights anymore</text>
  <text start="147.1" dur="6.34">exactly but the but you know you know</text>
  <text start="151.61" dur="4.5">you may have all these rights but at the</text>
  <text start="153.44" dur="4.17">same time you know governments do you</text>
  <text start="156.11" dur="4.14">know infringe on our rights and our</text>
  <text start="157.61" dur="4.62">liberties and such so but the idea was</text>
  <text start="160.25" dur="3.66">you know when you look at the history of</text>
  <text start="162.23" dur="4.14">the 14th amendment and that that</text>
  <text start="163.91" dur="3.72">conversation a lot of times people want</text>
  <text start="166.37" dur="3.36">to just take that whole thing and make</text>
  <text start="167.63" dur="6.03">it about race or about freeing the</text>
  <text start="169.73" dur="6.03">slaves and and that is certainly that in</text>
  <text start="173.66" dur="3.84">my opinion because the South wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="175.76" dur="3.509">taking the moral high road dealing with</text>
  <text start="177.5" dur="3.48">slavery but they were dealing with</text>
  <text start="179.269" dur="4.651">economics and the limitations of the</text>
  <text start="180.98" dur="6">federal government and so that 1% yeah</text>
  <text start="183.92" dur="4.86">but I agree yeah like a 1% overlord</text>
  <text start="186.98" dur="4.2">class in the South though and a lot of</text>
  <text start="188.78" dur="5.01">people give the whole South like bad rap</text>
  <text start="191.18" dur="6.27">for that oh yeah so there that history</text>
  <text start="193.79" dur="6.27">hardly gets told and so and then</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="4.65">whenever you are favoring the states</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="3.63">separating from the Union then then all</text>
  <text start="202.1" dur="3.99">of a sudden you&amp;#39;re in that group of</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s racist and just promoting slave</text>
  <text start="206.09" dur="3.75">oh that&amp;#39;s nonsense</text>
  <text start="207.29" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s not believe it what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="209.84" dur="5.07">issue that&amp;#39;s not the way the South</text>
  <text start="211.64" dur="4.77">looked at it but but regardless I say</text>
  <text start="214.91" dur="3.48">that because that&amp;#39;s where the 14th</text>
  <text start="216.41" dur="3.72">amendment was born and the thing about</text>
  <text start="218.39" dur="3.24">it was and then you can look at whether</text>
  <text start="220.13" dur="3">you think that was ratified or not</text>
  <text start="221.63" dur="3.41">because I don&amp;#39;t think it was there was a</text>
  <text start="223.13" dur="5.579">lot of things that were unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="6.729">that came out of the Civil War and the</text>
  <text start="228.709" dur="4.411">sentiment is what we the propaganda that</text>
  <text start="231.769" dur="3.271">we have today because people like to use</text>
  <text start="233.12" dur="5.04">the word American like that&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="235.04" dur="5.28">thing you know or the vain or how many</text>
  <text start="238.16" dur="4.29">people think there were a country that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.32" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s more ignorance no we&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="242.45" dur="4.8">a group of Europe you know what this</text>
  <text start="244.67" dur="5.58">Europe&amp;#39;s a country right you know the</text>
  <text start="247.25" dur="5.28">country of Europe that&amp;#39;s yeah you know</text>
  <text start="250.25" dur="4.079">so and then they you know and you know</text>
  <text start="252.53" dur="2.64">people from Germany aren&amp;#39;t saying well</text>
  <text start="254.329" dur="3.541">I&amp;#39;m European</text>
  <text start="255.17" dur="4.65">I&amp;#39;ve part of the United States of Europe</text>
  <text start="257.87" dur="3.839">so basically the government was able to</text>
  <text start="259.82" dur="3.93">reclassify us away from some of our</text>
  <text start="261.709" dur="3.541">rights in the courts well they may have</text>
  <text start="263.75" dur="2.43">but I mean that still doesn&amp;#39;t change you</text>
  <text start="265.25" dur="3.12">know you can have a</text>
  <text start="266.18" dur="3.87">peas and put a different label on the</text>
  <text start="268.37" dur="3.96">outside doesn&amp;#39;t change the peas on the</text>
  <text start="270.05" dur="3.63">inside these states are separate</text>
  <text start="272.33" dur="3.48">countries as the Declaration of</text>
  <text start="273.68" dur="6.269">Independence declares them to be and</text>
  <text start="275.81" dur="6.06">your process rips the label off well you</text>
  <text start="279.949" dur="2.97">know idea is that we&amp;#39;re just we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="281.87" dur="2.94">making up anything</text>
  <text start="282.919" dur="4.441">we&amp;#39;re just declaring what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="284.81" dur="4.47">and crap yeah the passport process</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="3.929">that&amp;#39;s a document that&amp;#39;s submitted under</text>
  <text start="289.28" dur="4.109">penalty of perjury as true and correct</text>
  <text start="291.289" dur="4.41">and so we provide an explanatory</text>
  <text start="293.389" dur="4.291">statement to the State Department and</text>
  <text start="295.699" dur="4.081">there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a lot it&amp;#39;s a four-page</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="4.919">affidavit we have total of ten pages</text>
  <text start="299.78" dur="4.169">they don&amp;#39;t make it easy and no and so we</text>
  <text start="302.599" dur="2.85">were just for a lot of people we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="303.949" dur="3.741">trying to declare what&amp;#39;s true and</text>
  <text start="305.449" dur="5.851">correct for us back when I was doing it</text>
  <text start="307.69" dur="6.159">we used to just amend the oath and wrote</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="4.56">change the terms and all seven the State</text>
  <text start="313.849" dur="3.54">Department accepted that then the State</text>
  <text start="315.86" dur="4.38">Department wrote me when I was doing my</text>
  <text start="317.389" dur="5.491">family&amp;#39;s passports and and we would</text>
  <text start="320.24" dur="4.62">capitalize letters see or put of America</text>
  <text start="322.88" dur="4.11">afterwards United States and they reject</text>
  <text start="324.86" dur="4.14">that and I have it in writing and they</text>
  <text start="326.99" dur="3.81">said if you don&amp;#39;t agree with the wording</text>
  <text start="329" dur="4.229">on the other you can supply an</text>
  <text start="330.8" dur="4.83">explanatory statement and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="333.229" dur="4.62">we started doing an extensive search</text>
  <text start="335.63" dur="4.469">statement everything that we&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="337.849" dur="4.621">the dance floor process has been in</text>
  <text start="340.099" dur="4.56">congruent with the State Department we</text>
  <text start="342.47" dur="4.319">have answered every letter and and so</text>
  <text start="344.659" dur="4.411">and the State Department issues passport</text>
  <text start="346.789" dur="4.741">now their sentiment net they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="349.07" dur="3.45">usually sign their correspondence so we</text>
  <text start="351.53" dur="3.629">don&amp;#39;t really know who we&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>
  <text start="352.52" dur="6.03">but their their communication over the</text>
  <text start="355.159" dur="5.521">last 15 20 years has not changed its the</text>
  <text start="358.55" dur="3.899">same wording all the time these are just</text>
  <text start="360.68" dur="3.989">forms that they kick out when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.449" dur="4.71">communicating with people okay people</text>
  <text start="364.669" dur="4.861">feel it&amp;#39;s important not to provide</text>
  <text start="367.159" dur="3.51">Social Security number and although we</text>
  <text start="369.53" dur="5.31">don&amp;#39;t put so security numbers on our</text>
  <text start="370.669" dur="6.12">applications we that they already have</text>
  <text start="374.84" dur="4.4">that number it&amp;#39;s that one aid and the</text>
  <text start="376.789" dur="4.38">government puts in your name and your</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="4.03">birthdate they have your social security</text>
  <text start="381.169" dur="4.711">number it&amp;#39;s not you&amp;#39;re not hiding it and</text>
  <text start="383.27" dur="5.13">I covered recently with Dan pilla just</text>
  <text start="385.88" dur="4.2">to briefly interrupt they are really</text>
  <text start="388.4" dur="3.239">ramping up their systems to get all of</text>
  <text start="390.08" dur="4.29">that data aggregated into just an</text>
  <text start="391.639" dur="5.021">easy-to-understand control panel like a</text>
  <text start="394.37" dur="4.81">Facebook to spy on us</text>
  <text start="396.66" dur="4.02">well yeah it&amp;#39;s gonna be fun yeah I I</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t think the governments have that</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="5.16">capability well they&amp;#39;re moving into that</text>
  <text start="403.44" dur="4.2">now that&amp;#39;s what I was trying to you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="405.84" dur="4.35">trying to convince me that the</text>
  <text start="407.64" dur="3.75">government is is streamlining into</text>
  <text start="410.19" dur="2.88">something simple that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="411.39" dur="3.63">trying to sell they are they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="413.07" dur="3.72">dumping and aggregating they contracted</text>
  <text start="415.02" dur="4.53">with some company like that does I guess</text>
  <text start="416.79" dur="5.01">PayPal or related to PayPal they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="419.55" dur="4.23">contracting for software to be able to</text>
  <text start="421.8" dur="4.08">just dump from many differents disparate</text>
  <text start="423.78" dur="3.21">sources all the different data places</text>
  <text start="425.88" dur="3.84">where they spy on us but they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="426.99" dur="4.56">really manage that data this give them</text>
  <text start="429.72" dur="3.99">graphs and charts and links to our</text>
  <text start="431.55" dur="5.01">emails and our social media and our cell</text>
  <text start="433.71" dur="5.04">phones everything says the blur controls</text>
  <text start="436.56" dur="4.44">right yeah it&amp;#39;s gonna be me for dummies</text>
  <text start="438.75" dur="4.37">I mean idiot proof here&amp;#39;s how you harass</text>
  <text start="441" dur="4.92">people for money I think on that level</text>
  <text start="443.12" dur="6.94">so here&amp;#39;s my question is that every</text>
  <text start="445.92" dur="6.12">single rep that gets sent to DC if every</text>
  <text start="450.06" dur="5.73">one of them aren&amp;#39;t coming up with bills</text>
  <text start="452.04" dur="7.47">to abolish the NSA then they&amp;#39;re enemies</text>
  <text start="455.79" dur="4.92">of the people now I usually go with it</text>
  <text start="459.51" dur="2.55">and go into it with the assumption that</text>
  <text start="460.71" dur="3.86">all politicians are enemies of the</text>
  <text start="462.06" dur="4.35">people but well but then you I</text>
  <text start="464.57" dur="3.79">understand that I don&amp;#39;t really think</text>
  <text start="466.41" dur="3.66">that way but because what I&amp;#39;m saying is</text>
  <text start="468.36" dur="4.83">is that then you&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="470.07" dur="5.52">the people&amp;#39;s reps yeah our enemies so</text>
  <text start="473.19" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s because the people are are</text>
  <text start="475.59" dur="3.75">ignorant but all I have to do is think</text>
  <text start="477.48" dur="3.93">of Morpheus walking down the road with</text>
  <text start="479.34" dur="3.87">neo telling him to look around and</text>
  <text start="481.41" dur="3.9">everything you see these are the very</text>
  <text start="483.21" dur="4.47">minds that we want to free and they will</text>
  <text start="485.31" dur="5.04">fight to defend a system that gives them</text>
  <text start="487.68" dur="4.59">their cookie I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="490.35" dur="3.66">they all are so as long as the</text>
  <text start="492.27" dur="4.05">government can let people in on a piece</text>
  <text start="494.01" dur="6.63">of its action they&amp;#39;ll be addicted to the</text>
  <text start="496.32" dur="6.24">system fair enough okay so anyway I</text>
  <text start="500.64" dur="4.5">didn&amp;#39;t mean to digress them no no that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.56" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s fastening side talk but you know</text>
  <text start="505.14" dur="3.84">this this process works people are</text>
  <text start="506.82" dur="3.99">getting results it&amp;#39;s helping people to</text>
  <text start="508.98" dur="3.17">be able to avoid some of the taxation</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="3.359">and such because it&amp;#39;s all legal</text>
  <text start="512.15" dur="5.17">basically it&amp;#39;s just understanding</text>
  <text start="514.169" dur="5.191">history right but I&amp;#39;m listening to the</text>
  <text start="517.32" dur="4.649">way you framing my daddy framing it I</text>
  <text start="519.36" dur="5.46">know I&amp;#39;m listening to how you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="521.969" dur="5.221">matters because I don&amp;#39;t want people you</text>
  <text start="524.82" dur="3.57">see you know because this is what this</text>
  <text start="527.19" dur="3.75">is what I&amp;#39;m hearing you saying is like</text>
  <text start="528.39" dur="4.26">the way my brain is processing it</text>
  <text start="530.94" dur="3.78">and it&amp;#39;s okay because you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="532.65" dur="4.08">what it is that we&amp;#39;re doing and so</text>
  <text start="534.72" dur="3.45">consequently saying so so you got a</text>
  <text start="536.73" dur="3.6">system that pretty much works for</text>
  <text start="538.17" dur="3.96">everybody it&amp;#39;s like no one&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="540.33" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;m saying because listen everybody</text>
  <text start="542.13" dur="4.71">comes to the table differently so and so</text>
  <text start="544.62" dur="3.78">a lot of times when people are dealing</text>
  <text start="546.84" dur="3.33">with government they&amp;#39;re looking for the</text>
  <text start="548.4" dur="4.5">government to give them that attaboy</text>
  <text start="550.17" dur="5.55">that&amp;#39;s those things are out there and so</text>
  <text start="552.9" dur="4.59">people are doing things all the forms of</text>
  <text start="555.72" dur="3.96">government asks you to do are assigned</text>
  <text start="557.49" dur="5.01">under penalty of perjury including a tax</text>
  <text start="559.68" dur="4.71">form so people are saying these things</text>
  <text start="562.5" dur="5.22">are true and correct so we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="564.39" dur="4.74">trying we just want people to be true</text>
  <text start="567.72" dur="3.15">and correct because otherwise they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="569.13" dur="4.77">purging themselves and unless you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.87" dur="7.68">Bill Clinton perjury is illegal and you</text>
  <text start="573.9" dur="6.27">know you go to jail so that&amp;#39;s all my my</text>
  <text start="578.55" dur="3.27">the reason that I&amp;#39;m putting it in this</text>
  <text start="580.17" dur="3.87">way and framing it in this way I guess</text>
  <text start="581.82" dur="3.63">is that generally when you find</text>
  <text start="584.04" dur="3.15">something like this it&amp;#39;s too good to be</text>
  <text start="585.45" dur="4.2">true and they find a way to smash you</text>
  <text start="587.19" dur="3.9">down even if it is legitimate and they</text>
  <text start="589.65" dur="2.67">make an example of someone because</text>
  <text start="591.09" dur="3.87">obviously this is not something they</text>
  <text start="592.32" dur="3.96">want well you know I I don&amp;#39;t disagree</text>
  <text start="594.96" dur="2.46">that because there&amp;#39;s a lot of funky</text>
  <text start="596.28" dur="3.57">stuff out there and people are</text>
  <text start="597.42" dur="4.77">definitely armed demand a lot of the</text>
  <text start="599.85" dur="4.2">people that I knew had gone to prison</text>
  <text start="602.19" dur="3.75">and all that stuff it&amp;#39;s definitely it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="604.05" dur="3.99">not nice but when I look at it or like</text>
  <text start="605.94" dur="4.53">everyone shipped he died in prison he</text>
  <text start="608.04" dur="4.89">was a big tax cut for him like his</text>

  <text start="786.31" dur="3.71">the definition of the term yeah you know</text>
  <text start="788.23" dur="4.46">in the Hooven case</text>
  <text start="790.02" dur="4.62">19:45 has three different definitions of</text>
  <text start="792.69" dur="3.899">the term United States so you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
