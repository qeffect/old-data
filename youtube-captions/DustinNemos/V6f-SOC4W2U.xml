  <text start="127.32" dur="5.729">the news so let&amp;#39;s begin with the Rosanna</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="4.649">situation I call this you know the</text>
  <text start="133.049" dur="3.061">culture category and I like to track</text>
  <text start="134.819" dur="4.471">everything that goes on there because</text>
  <text start="136.11" dur="6.329">that&amp;#39;s where the real war is unfolding</text>
  <text start="139.29" dur="7.71">that&amp;#39;s where a lot of the the things</text>
  <text start="142.439" dur="8.071">come out and the Rosanna situation is an</text>
  <text start="147" dur="5.099">interesting interesting situation and</text>
  <text start="150.51" dur="3.269">there&amp;#39;s a lot of ways to look at it some</text>
  <text start="152.099" dur="3.901">people are saying that she is a Zionist</text>
  <text start="153.779" dur="5.251">shell and she&amp;#39;s an insider</text>
  <text start="156" dur="5.61">she is kind of a person with a lot of</text>
  <text start="159.03" dur="6.93">leftist and and kind of far leftist</text>
  <text start="161.61" dur="7.56">views historically who is kind of</text>
  <text start="165.96" dur="5.07">winning over our our base in order to</text>
  <text start="169.17" dur="3.81">then make us look like a racist right as</text>
  <text start="171.03" dur="3.929">we&amp;#39;re trying to make this appeal with</text>
  <text start="172.98" dur="3.57">Kanye and others to the black community</text>
  <text start="174.959" dur="5.221">that Republicans actually care way more</text>
  <text start="176.55" dur="7.35">about them and then BOOM voila now white</text>
  <text start="180.18" dur="5.55">people look like racists again there is</text>
  <text start="183.9" dur="3.33">that aspect of things the timing is</text>
  <text start="185.73" dur="4.68">quite convenient I&amp;#39;m gonna go over that</text>
  <text start="187.23" dur="4.89">part too I&amp;#39;m not saying this what I what</text>
  <text start="190.41" dur="3.99">I believe I&amp;#39;m gonna do the fudge rule on</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="5.81">this one she seems to be coming back</text>
  <text start="194.4" dur="6.24">around and and this wasn&amp;#39;t really a race</text>
  <text start="197.93" dur="6.1">comment this was really more of a facial</text>
  <text start="200.64" dur="4.83">feature comment and and and really we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.03" dur="2.37">gonna get into that as well and what</text>
  <text start="205.47" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;ve done with the Trump and</text>
  <text start="206.4" dur="4.8">orangutangs things like that but</text>
  <text start="208.68" dur="5.61">basically this Roseanne thing also had</text>
  <text start="211.2" dur="5.039">an interesting prelude Roseanne got into</text>
  <text start="214.29" dur="3.93">a Twitter spat basically accusing</text>
  <text start="216.239" dur="4.981">Chelsea Clinton of being related Soros</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="5.489">and then she said she was quitting</text>
  <text start="221.22" dur="5.13">Twitter and her show was canceled after</text>
  <text start="223.709" dur="4.801">saying the Muslim Brotherhood and Planet</text>
  <text start="226.35" dur="4.08">of the Apes had a baby and that baby was</text>
  <text start="228.51" dur="4.02">a Valerie Jarrett okay if you&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="230.43" dur="3.93">Valerie Jarrett she absolutely looks</text>
  <text start="232.53" dur="3.929">like the female character historically</text>
  <text start="234.36" dur="6.08">in the original Planet of the Apes there</text>
  <text start="236.459" dur="7.321">is definitely a resemblance and Roseanne</text>
  <text start="240.44" dur="4.859">had also tweeted about cirrhosis goals</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="3.39">by the way the overthrow of the US</text>
  <text start="245.299" dur="3.91">constitutional republic by buying</text>
  <text start="247.17" dur="4.05">backing candidates for local district</text>
  <text start="249.209" dur="4.261">attorney races who will ignore US law in</text>
  <text start="251.22" dur="4.049">favor of feelings instead and call</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="4.71">everyone who was alarmed by that racist</text>
  <text start="255.269" dur="4.621">so you know there&amp;#39;s this backdrop where</text>
  <text start="258.18" dur="4.53">she&amp;#39;s actually kind of attacking Clinton</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="4.29">and Soros and then Valerie Jarrett I</text>
  <text start="262.71" dur="4.41">mean that maybe that&amp;#39;s too much at once</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="5.43">and they had to really try to capitalize</text>
  <text start="267.12" dur="5.28">on this not really quite that racist</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="4.38">comment and and just kind of make it</text>
  <text start="272.4" dur="3.6">look that way and she&amp;#39;s of course she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="273.99" dur="3.94">apologizing she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s taken the the</text>
  <text start="276" dur="3.4">mantle of the blame I would not</text>
  <text start="277.93" dur="4.859">done that I would have stood firm with</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="5.37">the comment because you know you can you</text>
  <text start="282.789" dur="4.021">can look goofy and it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be</text>
  <text start="284.77" dur="6.45">about your race you know many of us have</text>
  <text start="286.81" dur="6.329">done it on many an occasion and rosanne</text>
  <text start="291.22" dur="5.52">bars agency even drops her right after</text>
  <text start="293.139" dur="5.34">ABC cancels the show but there&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="296.74" dur="3.179">double standard and I&amp;#39;m going to talk a</text>
  <text start="298.479" dur="4.861">little bit about that while we go</text>
  <text start="299.919" dur="5.911">through this so one don&amp;#39;t open up this</text>
  <text start="303.34" dur="6.63">tweet where this guy kind of talks about</text>
  <text start="305.83" dur="5.519">that first perspective I mentioned or</text>
  <text start="309.97" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;m sorry this is this is the one where</text>
  <text start="311.349" dur="5.311">I&amp;#39;m talking about the double standard</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="4.05">that they have like this is a Keith</text>
  <text start="316.66" dur="5.819">Olbermann tweet and you know no one</text>
  <text start="319.33" dur="6.47">fired him and there&amp;#39;s a lot of Apple why</text>
  <text start="322.479" dur="8.16">not I mean you just eat severed heads</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="7.839">calls for violence everything you could</text>
  <text start="330.639" dur="6.87">think of against Trump you know and his</text>
  <text start="333.639" dur="5.31">supporters and yet the left never seems</text>
  <text start="337.509" dur="6.061">to care too much about holding those</text>
  <text start="338.949" dur="5.791">people accountable so moving on there is</text>
  <text start="343.57" dur="2.909">this one here</text>
  <text start="344.74" dur="6.6">and I think that&amp;#39;s the first one I was</text>
  <text start="346.479" dur="6.66">going to show you yeah here we go this</text>
  <text start="351.34" dur="3.66">is the fake B but it&amp;#39;s an interesting</text>
  <text start="353.139" dur="3.84">perspective she&amp;#39;s retweeting someone</text>
  <text start="355" dur="4.08">else I&amp;#39;ve never heard of but that</text>
  <text start="356.979" dur="4.5">someone is basically saying us</text>
  <text start="359.08" dur="3.899">Republicans love black people break out</text>
  <text start="361.479" dur="4.081">a mental slavery and join us brothers</text>
  <text start="362.979" dur="5.881">and sisters and then Rosanna Valerie</text>
  <text start="365.56" dur="7.32">Jarrett is a monkey and this story sort</text>
  <text start="368.86" dur="5.97">of sums it up if you really think about</text>
  <text start="372.88" dur="4.44">the situation and they finish up saying</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="5.519">okay thanks Rosanna big help obviously</text>
  <text start="377.32" dur="6">there&amp;#39;s some sarcasm here and this kind</text>
  <text start="380.349" dur="4.831">of sums up what happened but it gets</text>
  <text start="383.32" dur="5.64">even better than that the actual story</text>
  <text start="385.18" dur="5.97">gets gets deeper than that right after</text>
  <text start="388.96" dur="5.699">all of this went down and Walt Disney</text>
  <text start="391.15" dur="5.489">and ABC cancelled this I think maybe see</text>
  <text start="394.659" dur="3.841">is owned by Walt Walt Disney shares fell</text>
  <text start="396.639" dur="3.661">like two and a half percent I mean this</text>
  <text start="398.5" dur="3.72">is a massive chunk of their viewership</text>
  <text start="400.3" dur="3.989">this is gonna hurt the bottom line and</text>
  <text start="402.22" dur="3.689">they just banned I mean that&amp;#39;s people</text>
  <text start="404.289" dur="5.951">are actually siding with or XANA with us</text>
  <text start="405.909" dur="6.581">so more more balkanization more battle</text>
  <text start="410.24" dur="6.09">lines drawn more angry stares over the</text>
  <text start="412.49" dur="5.519">distance as the other you know opposing</text>
  <text start="416.33" dur="5.519">army stares back I mean that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="418.009" dur="5.88">what this is what she did was kind of</text>
  <text start="421.849" dur="3.121">stupid but not that bad and not nearly</text>
  <text start="423.889" dur="4.021">as bad as what they do on a regular</text>
  <text start="424.97" dur="4.56">basis but remember Saul Alinsky&amp;#39;s rules</text>
  <text start="427.91" dur="3.24">for radicals hold them to their</text>
  <text start="429.53" dur="3.21">standards which is what they do with us</text>
  <text start="431.15" dur="3.329">they hold us to any kind of moral</text>
  <text start="432.74" dur="4.17">standard that they think we actually</text>
  <text start="434.479" dur="5.101">hold so if they think we don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="436.91" dur="5.31">racism they call us racists to modulate</text>
  <text start="439.58" dur="4.05">our behavior but then don&amp;#39;t let them</text>
  <text start="442.22" dur="3.03">hold you to your standard that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="443.63" dur="4.77">other part of that rule with Saul</text>
  <text start="445.25" dur="5.699">Alinsky and they don&amp;#39;t really have any</text>
  <text start="448.4" dur="5.46">standards except double standards so</text>
  <text start="450.949" dur="8.821">we&amp;#39;re gonna go through that as well and</text>
  <text start="453.86" dur="9.36">then POTUS steps in and Trump just rips</text>
  <text start="459.77" dur="5.97">Disney CEO Bob Iger I think it is Ryder</text>
  <text start="463.22" dur="6.09">I&amp;#39;m not sure to say it for special</text>
  <text start="465.74" dur="8.58">treatment of Valerie Jarrett let&amp;#39;s go to</text>
  <text start="469.31" dur="6.87">that I always love how they find all</text>
  <text start="474.32" dur="3.54">these funny pictures and of course</text>
  <text start="476.18" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re also let me read through the</text>
  <text start="477.86" dur="4.23">tweet first Bob Iger of ABC called</text>
  <text start="479.93" dur="5.459">Valerie Jarrett to let her know that ABC</text>
  <text start="482.09" dur="5.91">does not tolerate comments like those</text>
  <text start="485.389" dur="4.801">made my Roseanne Barr and then he says</text>
  <text start="488" dur="3.87">gee he never called president Donald J</text>
  <text start="490.19" dur="4.969">Trump to apologize for the horrible</text>
  <text start="491.87" dur="6.419">statements made and said about me on ABC</text>
  <text start="495.159" dur="5.44">maybe I just didn&amp;#39;t get the call which</text>
  <text start="498.289" dur="4.321">is you know hilarious because they do</text>
  <text start="500.599" dur="4.85">have terrible terrible double standards</text>
  <text start="502.61" dur="5.91">going on plus things like this where</text>
  <text start="505.449" dur="6.611">Jimmy Kimmel has women grope his crotch</text>
  <text start="508.52" dur="5.79">with their mouths for a comedy skit he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.06" dur="3.93">still on the show here&amp;#39;s one where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.31" dur="5.46">actually kind of making fun of judge Roy</text>
  <text start="515.99" dur="7.109">Moore and alluding to child abuse I mean</text>
  <text start="519.77" dur="5.129">look at this stuff and it&amp;#39;s gonna get</text>
  <text start="523.099" dur="4.531">even more interesting than that I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="524.899" dur="4.861">more for you and like I said it gets</text>
  <text start="527.63" dur="4.769">more complicated because then Roseanne</text>
  <text start="529.76" dur="5.34">admits that she was ambien tweeting I</text>
  <text start="532.399" dur="4.68">mean basically kind of brain fog because</text>
  <text start="535.1" dur="4.2">you just took ambien which i think is a</text>
  <text start="537.079" dur="4.291">sleep medicine so it really fogs you up</text>
  <text start="539.3" dur="3.24">quickly and those things are really bad</text>
  <text start="541.37" dur="4.05">for you I like to</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="5.06">instead and by the bulk powder saves you</text>
  <text start="545.42" dur="5.97">a ton of money</text>
  <text start="547.6" dur="5.53">however ambien tweeting it&amp;#39;s a term I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="551.39" dur="4.26">certainly never heard before today and</text>
  <text start="553.13" dur="7.89">and she thought the Valerie Jarrett was</text>
  <text start="555.65" dur="7.29">actually a Saudi not black so it just</text>
  <text start="561.02" dur="3.33">gets even more interesting so she didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="562.94" dur="4.88">even think she was black is obvious not</text>
  <text start="564.35" dur="3.47">even a racist thing against black people</text>
  <text start="568.36" dur="6.64">so take a bit what you will maybe toward</text>
  <text start="570.89" dur="4.83">Arabs you know but I&amp;#39;m not sure I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="575" dur="6.87">really think so</text>
  <text start="575.72" dur="8.34">and then Rosanna it Oh wrong place okay</text>
  <text start="581.87" dur="3.96">so it&amp;#39;s shaping up to be a huge example</text>
  <text start="584.06" dur="4.59">of liberal hypocrisy and double</text>
  <text start="585.83" dur="4.83">standards as the left spews vileness and</text>
  <text start="588.65" dur="4.47">never ever shows any standards except</text>
  <text start="590.66" dur="4.11">their double standards and sometimes</text>
  <text start="593.12" dur="3.45">I&amp;#39;ll look away from the screen as I talk</text>
  <text start="594.77" dur="3">and I rant on and then I come back to</text>
  <text start="596.57" dur="6.41">the screen I&amp;#39;m in the wrong place</text>
  <text start="597.77" dur="9.09">sorry about that bear with me here and</text>
  <text start="602.98" dur="5.53">the liberal hypocrisy issue I want to</text>
  <text start="606.86" dur="3.15">kind of expand on that for a second I</text>
  <text start="608.51" dur="3.09">got a couple other things I want to show</text>
  <text start="610.01" dur="3.99">you here I&amp;#39;m sorry to focus so long on</text>
  <text start="611.6" dur="4.65">this Roseanne thing but it&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="614" dur="5.04">big deal right now in the cultural war</text>
  <text start="616.25" dur="5.85">and we need to know kind of what where</text>
  <text start="619.04" dur="4.41">we stand on this if she&amp;#39;s on our side or</text>
  <text start="622.1" dur="3.9">what you know that&amp;#39;s what kind of what</text>
  <text start="623.45" dur="6.51">I&amp;#39;m thinking or was this all one big</text>
  <text start="626" dur="6.83">setup in order to just set up and then</text>
