  <text start="452.83" dur="5.369">building up hate and why do you build up</text>
  <text start="454.629" dur="6.801">hate to create fear and opposition why</text>
  <text start="458.199" dur="5.611">do you do that because you want power</text>
  <text start="461.43" dur="4.539">so all that they&amp;#39;re doing in the media</text>
  <text start="463.81" dur="4.05">when they&amp;#39;re pushing this hate is trying</text>
  <text start="465.969" dur="3.81">to end up with somebody hurting us so</text>
  <text start="467.86" dur="3.899">that we will stop opposing their</text>
  <text start="469.779" dur="4.11">positions that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how it works is</text>
  <text start="471.759" dur="2.78">very simple it&amp;#39;s not complicated this is</text>
  <text start="473.889" dur="4.08">what they do</text>
  <text start="474.539" dur="5.71">talking about hate and also</text>
  <text start="477.969" dur="5.1">I&amp;#39;m talking about you know I won&amp;#39;t say</text>

  <text start="692.14" dur="4.4">strange I&amp;#39;ve had videos banned for</text>
  <text start="693.97" dur="5.31">reporting on this topic you know like</text>

  <text start="709.09" dur="6.03">around all these naked man and and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="711.46" dur="4.95">just this this culture has run amok you</text>
  <text start="715.12" dur="4.05">know I don&amp;#39;t want to get too far off</text>
  <text start="716.41" dur="4.71">into this but this is where we are there</text>
  <text start="719.17" dur="4.92">are people in our society who are brain</text>
  <text start="721.12" dur="5.88">damaged you know gender dysphoria for</text>
  <text start="724.09" dur="5.97">example around 50% suicide rate before</text>
  <text start="727" dur="4.8">or after you convert to a different sex</text>
  <text start="730.06" dur="5.4">so doesn&amp;#39;t matter it&amp;#39;s a mental disorder</text>
  <text start="731.8" dur="6.15">not a physical body issue and then you</text>
  <text start="735.46" dur="4.53">have these people are just in society</text>
  <text start="737.95" dur="2.85">like normal folks and you can&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="739.99" dur="3.23">unless they</text>
  <text start="740.8" dur="6.53">purple hair or look particularly crazy</text>
  <text start="743.22" dur="7.03">who they are you know and unfortunately</text>
  <text start="747.33" dur="4.84">people are very different people are</text>
  <text start="750.25" dur="3.12">very different and that&amp;#39;s a beauty but</text>
  <text start="752.17" dur="3.15">that also means that people are very</text>
  <text start="753.37" dur="4.76">different in their and their Worth and</text>
  <text start="755.32" dur="4.8">their quality and in the kind of</text>
  <text start="758.13" dur="3.04">associations that you might want to have</text>
  <text start="760.12" dur="3.209">with them and things like that so</text>
  <text start="761.17" dur="4.68">quality matters when it comes to people</text>
  <text start="763.329" dur="4.44">not just quantity for example and there</text>
  <text start="765.85" dur="3.6">are low quality people out there people</text>
  <text start="767.769" dur="3.331">who who don&amp;#39;t make the best decisions</text>
  <text start="769.45" dur="3.69">people who will drag you down kind of</text>
  <text start="771.1" dur="3.51">like the crab in the bucket and and so</text>
  <text start="773.14" dur="3.87">forth so this is a good cultural</text>
  <text start="774.61" dur="2.88">reminder that you know these things</text>
  <text start="777.01" dur="3.269">matter</text>
  <text start="777.49" dur="6.9">far far more than anything else in</text>
  <text start="780.279" dur="5.281">government or even a rule of you know</text>
  <text start="784.39" dur="2.73">form of government things like that I</text>
  <text start="785.56" dur="4.14">would argue that even more than a</text>
  <text start="787.12" dur="6">republic we need a strong culture to</text>
  <text start="789.7" dur="5.85">protect us from communism so this was</text>
  <text start="793.12" dur="4.44">kind of a long rant but this is an issue</text>
  <text start="795.55" dur="3.659">that affects a whole lot of children</text>
  <text start="797.56" dur="3.089">it&amp;#39;s just destroying a lot of children</text>
  <text start="799.209" dur="3.211">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re putting them on you know</text>
  <text start="800.649" dur="3">hormone blockers and they&amp;#39;re taking them</text>
  <text start="802.42" dur="3.15">away from parents and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="803.649" dur="3.841">government force to try to you know push</text>
  <text start="805.57" dur="3.45">this craziness and this nonsense in some</text>
  <text start="807.49" dur="3.57">cases people have lost their children</text>
  <text start="809.02" dur="4.14">for refusing to pump them full of</text>
  <text start="811.06" dur="4.05">hormone blockers that will subject them</text>
  <text start="813.16" dur="5.22">to a life of misery anguish cancer and</text>
  <text start="815.11" dur="6.18">early death and just you know loneliness</text>
  <text start="818.38" dur="4.68">and and confusion and inability to</text>
  <text start="821.29" dur="3.539">control their emotions and such because</text>
  <text start="823.06" dur="4.14">their brains are just completely haywire</text>
  <text start="824.829" dur="4.95">so you know this is an issue that I do</text>
  <text start="827.2" dur="8.07">feel like we need to push back on some</text>
  <text start="829.779" dur="9.18">more as able so continuing on we also</text>
  <text start="835.27" dur="5.91">have a unbelievably corrupt deep state</text>
  <text start="838.959" dur="2.701">operatives Strock Paige Baker and</text>
  <text start="841.18" dur="3.269">pre-snap</text>
  <text start="841.66" dur="5.07">clear to Comey so they ruled his stolen</text>
  <text start="844.449" dur="5.521">memos were not classified when they were</text>
  <text start="846.73" dur="5.49">classified so that&amp;#39;s interesting isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="849.97" dur="4.41">it so they&amp;#39;re allowed to I guess police</text>
  <text start="852.22" dur="5.58">their own so the agents who categorized</text>
  <text start="854.38" dur="6.389">the memos were deep state operatives</text>
  <text start="857.8" dur="6.99">before just mentioned this is how they</text>
  <text start="860.769" dur="6.151">operate so Victor Davis Hanson explains</text>
  <text start="864.79" dur="3.9">Jim Comey is high fiving tonight because</text>
  <text start="866.92" dur="3.12">he said he wasn&amp;#39;t indicted or he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="868.69" dur="3.8">going to be referred for an indictment</text>
  <text start="870.04" dur="5.15">why wasn&amp;#39;t he given that damning</text>
  <text start="872.49" dur="4.62">porked by the inspector general or why</text>
  <text start="875.19" dur="4.41">hasn&amp;#39;t oh I wasn&amp;#39;t he given that damning</text>
  <text start="877.11" dur="4.59">report and the reason he wasn&amp;#39;t was of</text>
  <text start="879.6" dur="3.36">the seven memos he memorialized these</text>
  <text start="881.7" dur="3.39">were private phone and person-to-person</text>
  <text start="882.96" dur="3.84">conversations with the president he took</text>
  <text start="885.09" dur="3.33">four of them home and he used them as an</text>
  <text start="886.8" dur="3.99">insurance policy in case something would</text>
  <text start="888.42" dur="5.13">happen when he was fired he used them</text>
  <text start="890.79" dur="4.59">and then he said they were confidential</text>
  <text start="893.55" dur="4.38">and not classified well who made that</text>
  <text start="895.38" dur="4.62">determination well after it all blew up</text>
  <text start="897.93" dur="3.45">to the press the FBI panicked and said</text>
  <text start="900" dur="4.05">there hadn&amp;#39;t been classified or</text>
  <text start="901.38" dur="4.95">categorized as anything or these hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="904.05" dur="5.85">let&amp;#39;s go back and look at them who were</text>
  <text start="906.33" dur="6.12">they who were the four people who looked</text>
  <text start="909.9" dur="4.44">at them they were bill priests out and</text>
  <text start="912.45" dur="3.3">we know he had gone on to London three</text>
  <text start="914.34" dur="3.18">times involved with Christopher steel</text>
  <text start="915.75" dur="3.57">and British intelligence there was James</text>
  <text start="917.52" dur="3.57">Baker who we know was leaking to Mother</text>
  <text start="919.32" dur="4.41">Jones to get out the steel dossier to</text>
  <text start="921.09" dur="4.62">the press before the election and in an</text>
  <text start="923.73" dur="2.76">Orwellian sense there was Lisa page and</text>
  <text start="925.71" dur="3.3">Peter strop</text>
  <text start="926.49" dur="4.47">no comment needed those four people</text>
  <text start="929.01" dur="3.75">after the whole thing blew up they got</text>
  <text start="930.96" dur="5.25">together and said let&amp;#39;s categorize these</text>
  <text start="932.76" dur="5.01">oh the ones that call me took home we</text>
  <text start="936.21" dur="4.68">determined are confidential and not</text>
  <text start="937.77" dur="4.86">felonious and the ones he left behind we</text>
  <text start="940.89" dur="3.33">will say are classified but he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="942.63" dur="5.07">subject to criminal exposure because he</text>
  <text start="944.22" dur="6.54">didn&amp;#39;t take those three home it&amp;#39;s insane</text>
  <text start="947.7" dur="5.07">but that&amp;#39;s what it is it&amp;#39;s the Comey</text>
  <text start="950.76" dur="3.39">rule if you&amp;#39;re part of the Democrat Club</text>
  <text start="952.77" dur="2.97">and you&amp;#39;re attacking Republicans or</text>

  <text start="959.91" dur="5.88">get in trouble that is the problem this</text>
  <text start="962.58" dur="6.18">is a one way justice system and that is</text>
  <text start="965.79" dur="4.95">what happens ultimately always when you</text>
  <text start="968.76" dur="3.81">have a large government large power base</text>
  <text start="970.74" dur="4.02">and groups that don&amp;#39;t like each other</text>
  <text start="972.57" dur="3.93">like multiculturalism they vie for</text>
  <text start="974.76" dur="4.2">government power to abuse it against</text>
  <text start="976.5" dur="3.87">each other and what has happened that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="978.96" dur="2.76">why we had religious freedom by the way</text>
  <text start="980.37" dur="4.35">because religious groups are doing that</text>
  <text start="981.72" dur="4.77">in earlier parts of history but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="984.72" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happened is the Democrats</text>
  <text start="986.49" dur="3.6">have infiltrated enough of government</text>
  <text start="988.59" dur="3.42">that they&amp;#39;re now using it to a process</text>
  <text start="990.09" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re using or the IRS they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="992.01" dur="3.87">it in the courts to vindicate themselves</text>
  <text start="994.56" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re using it at the higher levels to</text>
  <text start="995.88" dur="3.48">commit treason corruption and selling us</text>
  <text start="997.53" dur="4.65">out just showing the middle class things</text>
  <text start="999.36" dur="4.83">like that and what did they get nothing</text>
  <text start="1002.18" dur="3.49">but if you speak out against them you</text>
  <text start="1004.19" dur="3.88">could go to jail if you</text>
  <text start="1005.67" dur="4.74">if you you know oppose them in any way</text>
  <text start="1008.07" dur="4.23">they often crush you or disappear you or</text>
  <text start="1010.41" dur="3.39">you end up dead and there&amp;#39;s no there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1012.3" dur="3.42">barely an investigation it&amp;#39;s ruled a</text>
  <text start="1013.8" dur="5.1">suicide even in the case of Epstein who</text>
  <text start="1015.72" dur="7.17">was in suicide watch in a prison under</text>

  <text start="1022.89" dur="3.48">a I laugh or crying because it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1024.87" dur="4.29">unbelievable that this is where we are</text>
  <text start="1026.37" dur="4.74">but I&amp;#39;ll tell you one thing the beauty</text>
  <text start="1029.16" dur="4.05">of the Trump presidency is that people</text>
  <text start="1031.11" dur="4.32">now know about it and that is the</text>
