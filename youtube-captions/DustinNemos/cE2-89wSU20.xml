  <text start="11.88" dur="6.69">of SES research which by the way is one</text>
  <text start="15.69" dur="5.79">of the if not the largest producers of</text>
  <text start="18.57" dur="5.16">carbon 60 in the world we were talking a</text>
  <text start="21.48" dur="4.44">little bit about it maybe 80 90 percent</text>
  <text start="23.73" dur="3.959">or so I don&amp;#39;t even know for sure but</text>

  <text start="63.059" dur="4.74">mean if you&amp;#39;re going to go to the source</text>
  <text start="66.119" dur="3.511">to get the best information I mean that</text>
  <text start="67.799" dur="3.871">basically is you at this point like</text>
  <text start="69.63" dur="5.669">you&amp;#39;re one of the leading figures of the</text>
  <text start="71.67" dur="4.739">entire c60 industry so you know who</text>
  <text start="75.299" dur="4.021">better to tell us what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="76.409" dur="5.491">happening at the production level I mean</text>
  <text start="79.32" dur="4.17">that takes a lab that takes expensive</text>
  <text start="81.9" dur="4.23">equipment that takes a lot of dangerous</text>
  <text start="83.49" dur="5.46">chemicals in some cases that is an</text>
  <text start="86.13" dur="5.279">entirely different business usually lab</text>
  <text start="88.95" dur="4.349">to lab I think in and of itself and</text>
  <text start="91.409" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;ll talk about how it&amp;#39;s evolved more</text>
  <text start="93.299" dur="4.71">recently but what&amp;#39;s going on with the</text>
  <text start="96.479" dur="3.091">nasty rumors what&amp;#39;s going on why is it</text>
  <text start="98.009" dur="6.57">suddenly so expensive and hard to find</text>
  <text start="99.57" dur="7.589">so well the NASA rumors I can&amp;#39;t speak</text>
  <text start="104.579" dur="4.561">too much to them I can just say that we</text>
  <text start="107.159" dur="3.451">haven&amp;#39;t been bought out by NASA I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="109.14" dur="4.049">aware that NASA is particularly</text>
  <text start="110.61" dur="4.92">interested in in carbon 60 certainly</text>
  <text start="113.189" dur="4.441">they&amp;#39;re not interested in carbon 60 as</text>
  <text start="115.53" dur="4.35">it relates to olive oil their interest</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="4.32">would be more mechanical or more</text>
  <text start="119.88" dur="3.629">electromechanical if they were</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="3.33">interested and they&amp;#39;ve actually done</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="4.201">some research we&amp;#39;ve been were based in</text>
  <text start="125.28" dur="4.289">Houston so we&amp;#39;ve been to NASA and and</text>
  <text start="127.71" dur="4.77">you know had conversations we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="129.569" dur="3.951">actually done some work kind of in</text>
  <text start="132.48" dur="3.26">another talk</text>
  <text start="133.52" dur="4.17">of our business where we&amp;#39;ve done work</text>
  <text start="135.74" dur="4.68">there so I think you could technically</text>
  <text start="137.69" dur="4.74">call us NASA scientists I think that</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="4.2">might be a slight misrepresentation so</text>
  <text start="142.43" dur="3.87">we don&amp;#39;t we choose not to use that also</text>
  <text start="144.62" dur="3.93">I&amp;#39;m not sure exactly what a NASA</text>
  <text start="146.3" dur="5.73">scientists what value a NASA scientist</text>
  <text start="148.55" dur="5.16">might bring to the c60 all Avoyelles yes</text>
  <text start="152.03" dur="2.91">that&amp;#39;s just sort of a vague term it as</text>
  <text start="153.71" dur="2.58">an endowment ease for a special</text>
  <text start="154.94" dur="2.79">knowledge like what do you what is your</text>
  <text start="156.29" dur="4.59">specialty what&amp;#39;s your background</text>
  <text start="157.73" dur="5.43">so I actually my degrees in mechanical</text>
  <text start="160.88" dur="4.62">engineering I&amp;#39;ve got a minor in computer</text>
  <text start="163.16" dur="4.32">science and math and then my business</text>
  <text start="165.5" dur="3.75">partner and I we actually met in physics</text>
  <text start="167.48" dur="3.57">class at the University of Houston go</text>

  <text start="185.51" dur="3.93">insults and accusations around about it</text>

  <text start="202.49" dur="3.57">YouTube yet but there&amp;#39;s probably already</text>
  <text start="203.87" dur="3.75">an insult there well I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>

  <text start="217.88" dur="5.36">really just ya know same here so so</text>
  <text start="220.91" dur="4.71">Robert and I we met in physics class and</text>
  <text start="223.24" dur="4.42">and he was actually working for the</text>
  <text start="225.62" dur="5.85">texas center for superconductivity which</text>
  <text start="227.66" dur="5.52">is uh actually dr. Paul Chu is is very</text>
  <text start="231.47" dur="4.83">famous in the superconductivity world</text>
  <text start="233.18" dur="5.28">and and they actually on campus we used</text>
  <text start="236.3" dur="3.87">to call it choose castle like they built</text>
  <text start="238.46" dur="3.63">a big building a big research building</text>
  <text start="240.17" dur="3.63">and my business partner Robert Wong was</text>
  <text start="242.09" dur="4.86">working there and he&amp;#39;s actually working</text>
  <text start="243.8" dur="5.88">with another guy who was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="246.95" dur="4.86">a partner in SES research and they were</text>
  <text start="249.68" dur="3.87">separating fullerene so they were they</text>
  <text start="251.81" dur="4.05">were actually manufacturing and</text>
  <text start="253.55" dur="3.809">purchasing from the one company this</text>
  <text start="255.86" dur="3.39">irked me a little bit from the one</text>
  <text start="257.359" dur="3.591">company that was delivering commercial</text>
  <text start="259.25" dur="4.41">quantities of carbon nano materials</text>
  <text start="260.95" dur="4.719">specifically full earnings they were</text>
  <text start="263.66" dur="3.69">purchasing full rings from that company</text>
  <text start="265.669" dur="4.231">and they were separating</text>
  <text start="267.35" dur="5.61">material and so they were creating pure</text>
  <text start="269.9" dur="4.8">c16 pure see 70 my business partners</text>
  <text start="272.96" dur="4.17">from an entrepreneurial background his</text>
  <text start="274.7" dur="5.64">parents owned a business and at one</text>
  <text start="277.13" dur="4.29">point it was actually dr. chu that came</text>
  <text start="280.34" dur="2.31">in and said you guys are a bunch of</text>
  <text start="281.42" dur="3.51">young kids you shouldn&amp;#39;t you should</text>
  <text start="282.65" dur="4.08">start start a business and that was</text>
  <text start="284.93" dur="4.26">really all it took for my business</text>
  <text start="286.73" dur="4.41">partner murmured oh it&amp;#39;s right he&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="289.19" dur="4.77">I was already thinking of that at the</text>
  <text start="291.14" dur="5.64">time so get this just to give a little</text>
  <text start="293.96" dur="4.86">perspective there&amp;#39;s a lot of a lot of</text>
  <text start="296.78" dur="3.48">people are very concerned and and and</text>
  <text start="298.82" dur="2.97">you know it can be very frustrating than</text>
  <text start="300.26" dur="4.41">the price of c60 is so high right now</text>
  <text start="301.79" dur="6">and thankful that it&amp;#39;s no longer the</text>
  <text start="304.67" dur="5.82">price it was back in 1991 because at</text>
  <text start="307.79" dur="6.78">that time it was six thousand dollars a</text>
  <text start="310.49" dur="6.18">gram Wow so we have already come a long</text>
  <text start="314.57" dur="3.33">way and this is really I&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="316.67" dur="2.7">to tell people it&amp;#39;s just a speed bump</text>
  <text start="317.9" dur="2.7">temporarily we&amp;#39;re gonna get this figured</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="4.62">out supply and demand</text>
  <text start="320.6" dur="5.27">yes yes I think I think we are actually</text>
  <text start="323.99" dur="5.88">gonna get this figure it out but yes the</text>
  <text start="325.87" dur="5.89">community and what you guys are at the</text>
  <text start="329.87" dur="3.96">sphere of that I mean you guys are you</text>
  <text start="331.76" dur="4.68">know ramping up production right yes</text>
  <text start="333.83" dur="5.52">yeah so so one of the things when people</text>
  <text start="336.44" dur="5.43">like what happened to the industry you</text>
  <text start="339.35" dur="4.68">know why is there no 660 right now and</text>
  <text start="341.87" dur="4.32">and one of the things I kind of</text>
  <text start="344.03" dur="4.47">facetiously say is we made a mistake</text>
  <text start="346.19" dur="5.04">right we actually went out and grew the</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="5.22">olive oil c60 olive oil business too</text>
  <text start="351.23" dur="4.62">much and now we&amp;#39;re actually allocating</text>
  <text start="353.72" dur="3.63">all of our c60 production and we</text>
  <text start="355.85" dur="4.11">actually stopped making the lesser</text>
  <text start="357.35" dur="5.61">grades we&amp;#39;re only making the 99.99% pure</text>
  <text start="359.96" dur="4.89">and we&amp;#39;re putting that in our oil and</text>
  <text start="362.96" dur="4.02">then what&amp;#39;s left over I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="364.85" dur="4.74">you&amp;#39;re so I know you&amp;#39;re from the south</text>
  <text start="366.98" dur="4.53">or do you know Blue Bell ice cream I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="369.59" dur="3.21">heard of it yeah for some Blue Bell ice</text>
  <text start="371.51" dur="3.84">cream has this really they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="372.8" dur="3.21">from a cities probably about an hour and</text>
  <text start="375.35" dur="2.61">a half</text>
  <text start="376.01" dur="4.38">called Brenham outside of Houston and</text>
  <text start="377.96" dur="4.92">they they&amp;#39;re kind of slogan was Blue</text>
  <text start="380.39" dur="5.73">Bell ice cream we eat all we can know</text>
  <text start="382.88" dur="5.43">the rest right so right now all the c60</text>
  <text start="386.12" dur="3.75">is going into all of oil products and</text>
  <text start="388.31" dur="2.88">then we&amp;#39;re selling the rest and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="389.87" dur="3.21">trying to sell it we&amp;#39;re actually kind of</text>
  <text start="391.19" dur="4.71">controlling it through the website we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="393.08" dur="5.55">calling it flash sales and and getting</text>
  <text start="395.9" dur="4.41">it to a few as many people as we can so</text>
  <text start="398.63" dur="2.05">not letting like any one person come in</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="1.93">and</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="2.97">buy up all the stock yeah it&amp;#39;s like we</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="5.58">don&amp;#39;t have a much will trickle it out</text>
  <text start="403.65" dur="6.15">yes exactly we really do believe we know</text>
  <text start="407.82" dur="3.42">that the product is expensive and we</text>
  <text start="409.8" dur="3.6">really do believe that there are people</text>
  <text start="411.24" dur="4.08">out there who can benefit from the</text>
  <text start="413.4" dur="3.359">product and yes if they&amp;#39;re willing to</text>
  <text start="415.32" dur="2.73">kind of buy it and make it and I think</text>
  <text start="416.759" dur="3">you&amp;#39;ve done some videos on how to make</text>
  <text start="418.05" dur="5.19">it so they&amp;#39;re kind of following your</text>
  <text start="419.759" dur="4.981">lead on how to make some c60 and and and</text>
  <text start="423.24" dur="3.6">so that they can get it at a little bit</text>
  <text start="424.74" dur="4.83">more affordable price and and so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="426.84" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re very much believers and hey this</text>
  <text start="429.57" dur="3.36">has health benefits let&amp;#39;s get it in the</text>
  <text start="431.07" dur="4.14">hands of the people who you know all of</text>
  <text start="432.93" dur="5.16">the people that can benefit from it yeah</text>
  <text start="435.21" dur="5.37">and then go ahead was gonna say that</text>
  <text start="438.09" dur="4.68">that is sort of how I came to the whole</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="3.75">c60 industry and it maybe we&amp;#39;ll get to</text>
  <text start="442.77" dur="3.899">that at some point but it&amp;#39;s from the</text>
  <text start="444.33" dur="3.72">perspective of helping people to DIY</text>
  <text start="446.669" dur="3.571">some things at home in an affordable</text>
  <text start="448.05" dur="4.23">manner that can impact their lives and</text>
  <text start="450.24" dur="3.959">and and maybe reach people that</text>
  <text start="452.28" dur="4.41">otherwise couldn&amp;#39;t even have this sort</text>
  <text start="454.199" dur="5.461">of option yeah yeah and and I think</text>
  <text start="456.69" dur="5.27">we&amp;#39;re on the same page there like how do</text>
  <text start="459.66" dur="6.569">we how do we get this out to the masses</text>
  <text start="461.96" dur="5.8">so so we debated okay we&amp;#39;ve got our</text>
  <text start="466.229" dur="3.12">olive oil sales are going through the</text>
  <text start="467.76" dur="5.969">roof we definitely want to deliver that</text>
  <text start="469.349" dur="5.82">product and we ended up taking a c60 off</text>
  <text start="473.729" dur="4.351">of the market it wasn&amp;#39;t an easy decision</text>
  <text start="475.169" dur="4.891">and and really we&amp;#39;re missing out on a</text>
  <text start="478.08" dur="5.519">lot of c60 sales you can imagine there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="480.06" dur="4.62">a lot of value there but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="483.599" dur="2.611">the right business thing there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="484.68" dur="3.84">little bit more value as it goes into</text>
  <text start="486.21" dur="5.459">olive oil right so that&amp;#39;s a fact and</text>
  <text start="488.52" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re now working diligently to increase</text>
  <text start="491.669" dur="3.961">our production so we can deliver more</text>
  <text start="493.38" dur="5.7">now you mentioned kind of 80% of the</text>
  <text start="495.63" dur="6.06">market we we used to say yeah we we feel</text>
  <text start="499.08" dur="5.429">like we&amp;#39;re manufacturing distributing 80</text>
  <text start="501.69" dur="4.86">to 85 percent of the market and then we</text>
  <text start="504.509" dur="4.141">kind of saw what happened as we pulled</text>
  <text start="506.55" dur="4.26">that product off of the market like</text>
  <text start="508.65" dur="3.03">everybody&amp;#39;s calling everywhere people</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="2.279">are calling us</text>
  <text start="511.68" dur="5.039">we&amp;#39;re well-connected in the industry</text>
  <text start="513.089" dur="4.651">we&amp;#39;re talking to two companies and well</text>
  <text start="516.719" dur="2.76">just all over the world but in</text>
  <text start="517.74" dur="4.349">particular we&amp;#39;ve got some partners in</text>
  <text start="519.479" dur="4.98">Boston we&amp;#39;ve got some great contacts in</text>
  <text start="522.089" dur="4.261">Canada and we&amp;#39;re meeting with them and</text>

  <text start="530.459" dur="4.111">took the c60 off the market right</text>
  <text start="532.68" dur="4.709">because it&amp;#39;s going into all the world</text>
  <text start="534.57" dur="7.259">so we really have a sense that we&amp;#39;re 90</text>
  <text start="537.389" dur="6.271">95 maybe even a little bit more control</text>
  <text start="541.829" dur="2.931">if you will it&amp;#39;s not really control</text>
  <text start="543.66" dur="5.58">where you just are the largest</text>
  <text start="544.76" dur="6.73">manufacturer of c60 oh yeah it we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="549.24" dur="4.529">we&amp;#39;re we have a bit of a funnel right</text>
  <text start="551.49" dur="5.909">now and you know in you&amp;#39;re in a great</text>
  <text start="553.769" dur="5.25">position I do you know I see probably if</text>
  <text start="557.399" dur="3.211">not hundreds I see at least dozens of</text>
  <text start="559.019" dur="3.69">people now trying to figure it out like</text>
  <text start="560.61" dur="5.07">unlock the secrets of creation and</text>
  <text start="562.709" dur="4.951">everything because they&amp;#39;ve seen now the</text>
  <text start="565.68" dur="3.63">market and we&amp;#39;re seeing maybe we can</text>
  <text start="567.66" dur="4.109">talk about some of the scammers and some</text>
  <text start="569.31" dur="4.8">of the deceptive products on the market</text>
  <text start="571.769" dur="4.531">because that is a whole issue unto</text>
  <text start="574.11" dur="4.169">itself right a little bit scary yeah</text>
  <text start="576.3" dur="3.93">yeah it&amp;#39;s just proliferated now yeah</text>
  <text start="578.279" dur="3.591">where it was unknown some people on</text>
  <text start="580.23" dur="4.469">YouTube and yourself and others and</text>
  <text start="581.87" dur="5.529">maybe a little bit myself included have</text>
  <text start="584.699" dur="5.401">made this thing more popular and now</text>
  <text start="587.399" dur="5.071">there&amp;#39;s just so many people selling not</text>
  <text start="590.1" dur="4.83">c60 just other things yeah various</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="5.46">products well and we had concerns even</text>
  <text start="594.93" dur="4.62">even before we can put ourselves in this</text>
  <text start="597.93" dur="5.49">position where the olive oil sales were</text>
  <text start="599.55" dur="7.17">so high that that yes yes we&amp;#39;re selling</text>
  <text start="603.42" dur="4.95">c60 and and it felt like everybody when</text>
  <text start="606.72" dur="3.78">their brother is bringing out a product</text>
  <text start="608.37" dur="3.959">and then people are you know racing to</text>
  <text start="610.5" dur="3.72">the highest concentrations you kind of</text>
  <text start="612.329" dur="3.87">in your video like one of the one of the</text>
  <text start="614.22" dur="4.349">things you need to watch out for anybody</text>
  <text start="616.199" dur="4.95">who&amp;#39;s talking significant amounts over</text>
  <text start="618.569" dur="4.411">0.8 milligrams per milliliter yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="621.149" dur="4.261">not happening right that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="622.98" dur="4.38">probably not happening yeah</text>
  <text start="625.41" dur="4.609">and so you got to watch out for that so</text>
  <text start="627.36" dur="5.909">some people are like oh we&amp;#39;ve got 1.2</text>
  <text start="630.019" dur="5.111">mil leave you know 1.2 grams per liter</text>
  <text start="633.269" dur="4.471">right and ya know it doesn&amp;#39;t work that</text>
  <text start="635.13" dur="4.35">way no yeah I know that there&amp;#39;s that one</text>
  <text start="637.74" dur="3.69">oil that one olive oil that can hold</text>
  <text start="639.48" dur="3.81">like six times more but no one&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="641.43" dur="7.529">to spend that much money on one bottle</text>
  <text start="643.29" dur="7.08">of so I&amp;#39;m actually not aware of that and</text>
  <text start="648.959" dur="2.87">maybe a little embarrassed about that</text>
  <text start="650.37" dur="4.05">but so what me</text>
  <text start="651.829" dur="3.88">I haven&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think anyone&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="654.42" dur="2.789">to pay like seven eight hundred dollars</text>
  <text start="655.709" dur="3.18">for a bottle even if it is like super</text>
  <text start="657.209" dur="4.411">concentrated so I never bothered with it</text>
  <text start="658.889" dur="5.221">but apparently the core Aniki I may be</text>
  <text start="661.62" dur="5.48">saying it wrong olives that type of</text>
  <text start="664.11" dur="4.61">olive oil can hold 600 percent roughly</text>
  <text start="667.1" dur="4.39">interest</text>
  <text start="668.72" dur="4.21">yeah and this is this is there&amp;#39;s a whole</text>
  <text start="671.49" dur="2.97">bunch of people on the internet that are</text>
  <text start="672.93" dur="2.97">sort of experimenting in swapping</text>
  <text start="674.46" dur="3.96">stories some of them have actually been</text>
  <text start="675.9" dur="4.38">branching into new types of oils that</text>
  <text start="678.42" dur="4.83">are not of the typical market I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="680.28" dur="4.62">talking like algae oils and and various</text>
  <text start="683.25" dur="4.37">different CBD oils and different things</text>
  <text start="684.9" dur="4.65">like that I mean they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="687.62" dur="4.75">experimenting and drumming up some</text>
  <text start="689.55" dur="4.11">interesting things but and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="692.37" dur="2.97">I&amp;#39;m also hearing a lot of people trying</text>
  <text start="693.66" dur="3.84">to build their own machines and trying</text>
  <text start="695.34" dur="4.77">to perfect that process and everything</text>
  <text start="697.5" dur="6.09">because the demand is definitely there</text>
  <text start="700.11" dur="6.45">yeah well so what&amp;#39;s interesting is is is</text>
  <text start="703.59" dur="5.07">the demand really there yeah right</text>
  <text start="706.56" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s a demand for a certain amount</text>
  <text start="708.66" dur="3.99">and I think a lot of people are you know</text>
  <text start="710.64" dur="5.31">hey we need to make a reactor and</text>
  <text start="712.65" dur="6.15">actually read any an email from a</text>
  <text start="715.95" dur="3.93">company that that&amp;#39;s out of the UK I</text>
  <text start="718.8" dur="3.47">don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;re familiar with</text>
  <text start="719.88" dur="5.87">redline and they do they talk about</text>
  <text start="722.27" dur="5.68">pulverizing c60 and they&amp;#39;ve you know</text>
  <text start="725.75" dur="4.96">interested in that the pulverize thing</text>
  <text start="727.95" dur="4.889">yeah so polarizing I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="730.71" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;ve done a good job of spinning that</text>
  <text start="732.839" dur="5.611">pulverizing is more important than it</text>
  <text start="734.85" dur="6.9">actually is polarizing is so imagine you</text>
  <text start="738.45" dur="4.889">took you know you can go buy salt and it</text>
  <text start="741.75" dur="3.54">can be come in it can come in really</text>
  <text start="743.339" dur="4.351">large crystals and you kind of use a</text>
  <text start="745.29" dur="4.68">little salt shaker yeah and you twist it</text>
  <text start="747.69" dur="4.47">and it turns it into smaller smaller</text>
  <text start="749.97" dur="5.1">crystals if you put large crystals of</text>
  <text start="752.16" dur="5.07">salt in water it takes longer for those</text>
  <text start="755.07" dur="4.95">to dissolve than if you put very fine</text>
  <text start="757.23" dur="4.47">crystals of salt in and pulverization is</text>
  <text start="760.02" dur="2.819">doing the same thing that&amp;#39;s all that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="761.7" dur="3.21">doing is it&amp;#39;s like hey you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="762.839" dur="6.061">significantly increased the surface area</text>
  <text start="764.91" dur="6.51">of of the c60 and and so now it goes</text>
  <text start="768.9" dur="3.96">into solution faster you know one of the</text>
  <text start="771.42" dur="2.76">things I know there was an email thread</text>
  <text start="772.86" dur="3.479">a lot of people a lot of our customers</text>
  <text start="774.18" dur="4.05">will come to us and say hey this</text>
  <text start="776.339" dur="4.411">particular manufacturer is saying this</text>
  <text start="778.23" dur="4.74">what do you think and they were talking</text>
  <text start="780.75" dur="3.93">about this was Red Lion they were</text>
  <text start="782.97" dur="4.17">talking about oh the polarization</text>
  <text start="784.68" dur="4.56">process changes the frequency and so the</text>
  <text start="787.14" dur="3.99">frequency is much healthier and so I</text>
  <text start="789.24" dur="3.72">just wrote back to this kind of mutual</text>
  <text start="791.13" dur="3.84">client or maybe prospective client of</text>
  <text start="792.96" dur="5.49">theirs and I was like okay so what was</text>
  <text start="794.97" dur="6.27">what was the frequency before what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="798.45" dur="3.54">frequency after and where is the</text>
  <text start="801.24" dur="2.82">research that</text>
  <text start="801.99" dur="4.11">shows that that frequency matters and</text>
  <text start="804.06" dur="5">there&amp;#39;s any difference right yeah they</text>
  <text start="806.1" dur="4.98">do go into a lot of the more woowoo area</text>
  <text start="809.06" dur="3.46">energetics and stuff which I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="811.08" dur="3.54">discounting it but you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="812.52" dur="4.77">I don&amp;#39;t base my decision-making off of</text>
  <text start="814.62" dur="4.65">that yeah it&amp;#39;s tough when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="817.29" dur="3.72">immeasurable right in its and it&amp;#39;s tough</text>
  <text start="819.27" dur="4.14">if you&amp;#39;re gonna say the frequency is</text>
  <text start="821.01" dur="3.87">better now than it was I think you and I</text>
  <text start="823.41" dur="3.179">are on the same page what was the</text>
  <text start="824.88" dur="3.57">frequency before what&amp;#39;s the frequency</text>
  <text start="826.589" dur="3.87">now and then what&amp;#39;s the research that</text>
  <text start="828.45" dur="4.19">shows that this new frequency is better</text>
  <text start="830.459" dur="4.591">if we&amp;#39;re not talking about those things</text>
  <text start="832.64" dur="5.23">we may not be we may be talking about</text>
  <text start="835.05" dur="4.47">something real but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s hard for me</text>
  <text start="837.87" dur="3.779">to put my finger on it and I&amp;#39;ve got I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="839.52" dur="3.9">got I&amp;#39;ve got enough to deal with with</text>
  <text start="841.649" dur="4.471">real stuff right that I can actually</text>
  <text start="843.42" dur="5.34">actually measure um one note on</text>
  <text start="846.12" dur="5.07">polarization we actually there was a</text>
  <text start="848.76" dur="4.68">group I think was out of MIT that went</text>
  <text start="851.19" dur="3.899">to pulverize c60 because what they were</text>
  <text start="853.44" dur="4.01">trying to do is turn it into an aerosol</text>
  <text start="855.089" dur="6.661">and give it you can give it to rats and</text>
  <text start="857.45" dur="7.36">so those they actually ended up ruining</text>
  <text start="861.75" dur="4.2">their c60 so we sold them the c60 and I</text>
  <text start="864.81" dur="2.85">don&amp;#39;t know if you know this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="865.95" dur="5.07">actually mentioned in the original rat</text>
  <text start="867.66" dur="5.58">study that that body rat study actually</text>
  <text start="871.02" dur="4.2">and then we&amp;#39;re in a lot of papers</text>
  <text start="873.24" dur="3.87">because we&amp;#39;ve been doing this a long</text>
  <text start="875.22" dur="5.1">time say that again very cool by the way</text>
  <text start="877.11" dur="4.74">yeah I think yeah it is we&amp;#39;re very we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="880.32" dur="3.9">very happy and proud that they decided</text>
  <text start="881.85" dur="4.859">to mention us and we&amp;#39;re in a lot of</text>
  <text start="884.22" dur="5.79">other papers right so so they wanted to</text>
  <text start="886.709" dur="5.971">aerosolize the c60 have it in hailed by</text>
  <text start="890.01" dur="4.5">rats and when they were trying to turn</text>
  <text start="892.68" dur="3.899">it and pulverize it and to really find</text>
  <text start="894.51" dur="3.66">particles they ended up ruining it</text>
  <text start="896.579" dur="4.2">actually ended up oxidizing it and</text>
  <text start="898.17" dur="4.68">changing the the actual c60 kind of</text>
  <text start="900.779" dur="3.691">turning it into something else and they</text>
  <text start="902.85" dur="4.049">ended up sending it back to us we</text>
  <text start="904.47" dur="4.77">reprocessed it and sent you know about</text>
  <text start="906.899" dur="5.43">20% of it back because it had been so</text>
  <text start="909.24" dur="5.58">damaged so I would be a little bit</text>
  <text start="912.329" dur="4.2">concerned about the polarization process</text>
  <text start="914.82" dur="2.19">and do they really know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="916.529" dur="2.761">doing</text>
  <text start="917.01" dur="4.199">I&amp;#39;m not saying they don&amp;#39;t I would just</text>
  <text start="919.29" dur="3.48">be worried about that that&amp;#39;s that that</text>
  <text start="921.209" dur="3.091">would be my concern when you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="922.77" dur="1.83">about Cofer ization well well fair</text>
  <text start="924.3" dur="2.7">enough</text>
  <text start="924.6" dur="4.229">and and you could definitely criticize</text>
  <text start="927" dur="4.35">maybe the process and some of the we</text>
  <text start="928.829" dur="5.37">will talk but you know I&amp;#39;ve even seen</text>
  <text start="931.35" dur="3.57">others out there who are leaving spam</text>
  <text start="934.199" dur="3.901">comments</text>
  <text start="934.92" dur="5.94">my videos for example trying to lure</text>
  <text start="938.1" dur="4.65">people to super fullerenes or something</text>
  <text start="940.86" dur="3.57">else using the exact same rat study by</text>
  <text start="942.75" dur="3.48">the way but then we&amp;#39;re talking up a</text>
  <text start="944.43" dur="5.67">completely different product and using</text>
  <text start="946.23" dur="5.07">the same c60 maybe to sell it and they</text>

  <text start="1378.2" dur="4.05">hands of as many people as possible yeah</text>
  <text start="1380.48" dur="4.5">and I want to actually want to do the</text>
  <text start="1382.25" dur="4.55">hydrogen water there&amp;#39;s like a DIY recipe</text>
  <text start="1384.98" dur="5.25">I found that&amp;#39;s stronger than typical</text>
  <text start="1386.8" dur="4.78">hydrogen machines but I want to pair</text>
  <text start="1390.23" dur="3.21">that with the c60 I&amp;#39;ve heard good things</text>
  <text start="1391.58" dur="3.72">there as well and that&amp;#39;s another almost</text>
  <text start="1393.44" dur="5.01">free thing that you can do at home</text>
  <text start="1395.3" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s very cheap I so I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1398.45" dur="2.67">experimented with it</text>
  <text start="1399.62" dur="4.559">I&amp;#39;m not aware of any particular</text>
  <text start="1401.12" dur="5.25">literature and I don&amp;#39;t you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1404.179" dur="4.831">I don&amp;#39;t at this point especially when it</text>
  <text start="1406.37" dur="4.26">comes to testimonials I just I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="1409.01" dur="3.63">do doubt it because that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1410.63" dur="5.1">scientists by Nature of course but</text>
  <text start="1412.64" dur="4.68">everything but it no longer surprises me</text>
  <text start="1415.73" dur="3.36">when people say things so I say if</text>
  <text start="1417.32" dur="4.14">hydrogen is beneficial that that</text>
  <text start="1419.09" dur="3.75">wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me I I love the idea</text>
  <text start="1421.46" dur="3.06">of doing some research in that area</text>
  <text start="1422.84" dur="3.75">maybe at some point cuz it is very cheap</text>
  <text start="1424.52" dur="6.24">to make with some magnesium rods and</text>
  <text start="1426.59" dur="6.81">some home chemistry but I imagine I</text>
  <text start="1430.76" dur="4.35">think the the the typical argument for</text>
  <text start="1433.4" dur="4.74">that the best I&amp;#39;ve heard so far is that</text>
  <text start="1435.11" dur="4.62">the c60 just binds the hydrogen and</text>
  <text start="1438.14" dur="2.94">moves it around the body everywhere just</text>
  <text start="1439.73" dur="5.28">kind of flushes the body out with</text>
  <text start="1441.08" dur="6.36">hydrogen I I don&amp;#39;t know the chemistry of</text>
  <text start="1445.01" dur="5.22">it honestly so I won&amp;#39;t further comment</text>
  <text start="1447.44" dur="4.71">but it seems like a very cheap thing to</text>
  <text start="1450.23" dur="3.9">do and the hydrogen water thing itself</text>
  <text start="1452.15" dur="4.59">is a craze than another self yeah</text>
  <text start="1454.13" dur="4.799">there&amp;#39;s all industry and whole trend</text>
  <text start="1456.74" dur="3.689">behind that right now yeah lots of lots</text>
  <text start="1458.929" dur="4.141">of great testimonials about hydrogen</text>
  <text start="1460.429" dur="5.671">I&amp;#39;ve got a cousin who owns owns a water</text>

  <text start="1547.49" dur="4.14">course the hate comments because that</text>
  <text start="1548.99" dur="3.78">those always occur you probably started</text>
  <text start="1551.63" dur="2.55">getting come to some comments of like</text>
  <text start="1552.77" dur="2.52">will you sell it and you&amp;#39;re like well</text>
  <text start="1554.18" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s a good idea</text>
  <text start="1555.29" dur="4.29">I like to sell stuff that&amp;#39;s good for</text>
  <text start="1557.78" dur="4.23">people so yeah that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m imagining</text>
  <text start="1559.58" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s how it started well yeah it is</text>
  <text start="1562.01" dur="4.53">and also there was also a whole nother</text>
  <text start="1564.38" dur="3.72">aspect of it in that I&amp;#39;m alt media and</text>
  <text start="1566.54" dur="3.63">and I was actually actively being</text>
  <text start="1568.1" dur="4.86">censored during this relative time</text>
  <text start="1570.17" dur="5.22">period by YouTube and other places and</text>
  <text start="1572.96" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s difficult to even make ends meet as</text>
  <text start="1575.39" dur="5.1">all media these days so we&amp;#39;re sort of an</text>
  <text start="1578.39" dur="5.61">underfunded guerilla army of digital</text>
  <text start="1580.49" dur="5.88">warrior types these days but you know to</text>
  <text start="1584" dur="4.52">that extent I really love having some</text>
  <text start="1586.37" dur="4.8">around myself I love having you know</text>
  <text start="1588.52" dur="4.09">sometimes I&amp;#39;ll have some extra in the</text>
  <text start="1591.17" dur="3.03">bottom of the bucket and that&amp;#39;s for the</text>
  <text start="1592.61" dur="6.06">dogs you know and then yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1594.2" dur="7.05">affordable for my pets even so well and</text>
  <text start="1598.67" dur="4.65">we had kind of talked about maybe maybe</text>
  <text start="1601.25" dur="4.049">us working together so</text>
  <text start="1603.32" dur="3.54">maybe part of that needs to be an</text>
  <text start="1605.299" dur="8.581">arrangement where you&amp;#39;ve got access to a</text>
  <text start="1606.86" dur="9.33">little extra I mean so we talked about</text>
  <text start="1613.88" dur="5.19">you know some some of the shortage and</text>
  <text start="1616.19" dur="4.77">the NASA thing obviously that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1619.07" dur="3.42">sort of a rumor at this point and if</text>
  <text start="1620.96" dur="2.73">they did do something like that you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1622.49" dur="4.74">think that you&amp;#39;d be the first person</text>
  <text start="1623.69" dur="7.8">they&amp;#39;d approach about it I we would and</text>
  <text start="1627.23" dur="6.3">and is interesting so there&amp;#39;s a on some</text>
  <text start="1631.49" dur="4.89">of the Facebook forums there&amp;#39;s somebody</text>
  <text start="1633.53" dur="4.26">as posted like the current status of the</text>
  <text start="1636.38" dur="4.38">fullerene industry and that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="1637.79" dur="5.55">that comes out every year and we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1640.76" dur="4.44">even mentioned in this so so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1643.34" dur="3.6">surprising to us every year because we</text>
  <text start="1645.2" dur="4.95">know the quantities that the companies</text>
  <text start="1646.94" dur="5.91">that they mention sell we sell to most</text>
  <text start="1650.15" dur="4.59">of them and they don&amp;#39;t mention us and so</text>
  <text start="1652.85" dur="5.04">their understanding of where the market</text>
  <text start="1654.74" dur="5.61">is is as just totally off like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1657.89" dur="4.5">really I don&amp;#39;t I mean and part of the</text>
  <text start="1660.35" dur="3.949">reason is because it is a small industry</text>
  <text start="1662.39" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s a very small industry like I say</text>
  <text start="1664.299" dur="6.461">right now the demand is big yes but the</text>
  <text start="1668.03" dur="5.13">demand in terms of quantity that people</text>
  <text start="1670.76" dur="4.71">need is actually not that big we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1673.16" dur="4.139">projecting because of partnerships that</text>
  <text start="1675.47" dur="3.39">we know apartment partnerships that we</text>
  <text start="1677.299" dur="4.021">have and people that we know in the</text>
  <text start="1678.86" dur="4.35">industry that they&amp;#39;re there really are</text>
  <text start="1681.32" dur="3.75">three technologies for making fullerenes</text>
  <text start="1683.21" dur="4.23">for making fullerenes in general and</text>
  <text start="1685.07" dur="4.05">then see sixty first one is the arc</text>
  <text start="1687.44" dur="3.69">method right so that&amp;#39;s our favorite</text>
  <text start="1689.12" dur="5.429">method we&amp;#39;ve been doing it since 1991</text>
  <text start="1691.13" dur="5.34">and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the method the next</text>
  <text start="1694.549" dur="3.75">one is flame synthesis so those</text>
  <text start="1696.47" dur="4.47">organizations that have been using flame</text>
  <text start="1698.299" dur="4.951">synthesis to do nanotubes forever in a</text>
  <text start="1700.94" dur="4.85">day and we&amp;#39;re aware of one organization</text>
  <text start="1703.25" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s actually shifting that technology</text>
  <text start="1705.79" dur="4.54">because of their opportunities in a</text>
  <text start="1708.47" dur="4.68">particular industry that&amp;#39;s not olive</text>
  <text start="1710.33" dur="5.94">oil-based not health based so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1713.15" dur="5.01">gonna be firing up a machine we think in</text>
  <text start="1716.27" dur="3.99">the first quarter of this year it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1718.16" dur="4.88">probably going to be a 220 kilogram</text>
  <text start="1720.26" dur="5.64">machine right 20 kilograms per month</text>
  <text start="1723.04" dur="4.93">another organization in Canada their</text>
  <text start="1725.9" dur="4.29">plasma technology we think they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1727.97" dur="4.98">to be firing up about the same thing mid</text>
  <text start="1730.19" dur="4.68">to the end of next year and then we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1732.95" dur="3.43">doing the same so you&amp;#39;re looking at 60</text>
  <text start="1734.87" dur="4.45">kilograms of production</text>
  <text start="1736.38" dur="4.74">ability that is extract right so cut</text>
  <text start="1739.32" dur="4.98">that in half to make it easy so 30</text>
  <text start="1741.12" dur="6.12">kilograms the current market is probably</text>
  <text start="1744.3" dur="4.98">less than 10 mm right so we have these</text>
  <text start="1747.24" dur="4.02">people who are wanting to make reactors</text>
  <text start="1749.28" dur="5.45">but they&amp;#39;re gonna join a market that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1751.26" dur="5.79">gonna be saturated really quickly and</text>
  <text start="1754.73" dur="5.05">there&amp;#39;s a lot of challenge for the</text>
  <text start="1757.05" dur="4.26">customers I guess yes yes at the at the</text>
  <text start="1759.78" dur="4.32">end of the day that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s very true</text>
  <text start="1761.31" dur="5.34">right and and we&amp;#39;re partnering with some</text>
  <text start="1764.1" dur="6.03">of them because the other technologies</text>
  <text start="1766.65" dur="5.01">are more are more scalable so the carbon</text>
  <text start="1770.13" dur="3.12">arc technology so I don&amp;#39;t know if you</text>
  <text start="1771.66" dur="3.63">know much about the carbon arc</text>
  <text start="1773.25" dur="3.84">technology basically you&amp;#39;re vaporizing</text>
  <text start="1775.29" dur="3.39">graphite yeah I&amp;#39;m familiar with the</text>
  <text start="1777.09" dur="3.27">basics you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re bouncing</text>
  <text start="1778.68" dur="2.31">lightning between graphite and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1780.36" dur="2.4">shaving</text>
  <text start="1780.99" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;ve never heard it put that way I love</text>
  <text start="1782.76" dur="3.12">that that&amp;#39;s a bouncing Lightning between</text>
  <text start="1784.59" dur="2.55">graphite right well I&amp;#39;ll let people</text>
  <text start="1785.88" dur="3.57">understand it&amp;#39;s dangerous</text>
  <text start="1787.14" dur="5.49">yeah it&amp;#39;s very dangerous so if in fact</text>
  <text start="1789.45" dur="6.69">when when we run our machine we actually</text>
  <text start="1792.63" dur="5.88">have to have like a welders goggles our</text>
  <text start="1796.14" dur="4.17">viewport if you don&amp;#39;t put that in fact</text>
  <text start="1798.51" dur="5.22">if you don&amp;#39;t cover the viewport entirely</text>
  <text start="1800.31" dur="5.1">you&amp;#39;ll get a sunburn Wow it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1803.73" dur="3.45">localized temperature of the Sun like</text>
  <text start="1805.41" dur="6">lightning in the Sun you&amp;#39;ll get a</text>
  <text start="1807.18" dur="7.05">sunburn and and so one of the challenges</text>
  <text start="1811.41" dur="4.8">so so a typical carbon arc is basically</text>
  <text start="1814.23" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s like a quarter-inch graphite rod</text>
  <text start="1816.21" dur="4.05">right and when you run a quarter-inch</text>
  <text start="1818.49" dur="3.3">graphite rod you might be able to get 10</text>
  <text start="1820.26" dur="3.87">to 15% fullerenes</text>
  <text start="1821.79" dur="3.63">your natural thing is like hey I need to</text>
  <text start="1824.13" dur="3.03">make more soot because I need to make</text>
  <text start="1825.42" dur="3.21">more fullerenes as let&amp;#39;s go to a</text>
  <text start="1827.16" dur="3.99">half-inch rod so now you&amp;#39;re on a</text>
  <text start="1828.63" dur="6.51">half-inch rod and your yield drops to 8</text>
  <text start="1831.15" dur="6">6 to 8% right so the the method of</text>
  <text start="1835.14" dur="4.68">making the rod bigger for the lightning</text>
  <text start="1837.15" dur="6.12">to shoot back and forth and vaporize it</text>
  <text start="1839.82" dur="5.82">is is counterproductive to your yield so</text>
  <text start="1843.27" dur="3.96">more and smaller is better I guess and</text>
  <text start="1845.64" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s a fine balance like</text>
  <text start="1847.23" dur="4.98">the engineering has this very classic</text>
  <text start="1849.48" dur="6.06">balance of okay we want to increase the</text>
  <text start="1852.21" dur="5.73">throughput but it has a has a cost of</text>
  <text start="1855.54" dur="4.59">production yield and so what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1857.94" dur="3.78">optimal one so you&amp;#39;ve got to play around</text>
  <text start="1860.13" dur="3.57">to find out what that optimal one but</text>
  <text start="1861.72" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s that what I just described his</text>
  <text start="1863.7" dur="4.86">wife the most popular current popular</text>
  <text start="1866.49" dur="3.37">technique is really not scalable from</text>
  <text start="1868.56" dur="2.68">really mass production</text>
  <text start="1869.86" dur="4.559">so there&amp;#39;s other technologies which is</text>
  <text start="1871.24" dur="5.039">flame synthesis and in in a and a plasma</text>
  <text start="1874.419" dur="3.75">technology that are that are really</text>
  <text start="1876.279" dur="4.38">ultimately going to be the things that</text>
  <text start="1878.169" dur="4.561">carry us when you know everybody and</text>
  <text start="1880.659" dur="5.701">their brother is taking you know a dose</text>
  <text start="1882.73" dur="4.98">a day planet to be fair this is very</text>
  <text start="1886.36" dur="3.33">much like silver or something this is</text>
  <text start="1887.71" dur="4.11">very much an industrial product that has</text>
  <text start="1889.69" dur="4.05">health uses on the side and this is a</text>
  <text start="1891.82" dur="4.17">small aspect of its total thing although</text>
  <text start="1893.74" dur="4.5">from personal experience I do think that</text>
  <text start="1895.99" dur="4.71">you know if we if we&amp;#39;re only a third of</text>
  <text start="1898.24" dur="4.23">total supply right now in terms of</text>
  <text start="1900.7" dur="4.349">demand that people will catch up to that</text>
  <text start="1902.47" dur="4.589">very quickly I think with proper</text>
  <text start="1905.049" dur="3.6">marketing yeah I think and at the end of</text>
  <text start="1907.059" dur="3.84">the day this is about marketing if you</text>
  <text start="1908.649" dur="5.971">think about where the industry is today</text>
  <text start="1910.899" dur="6.091">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s people like you and me and and</text>
  <text start="1914.62" dur="3.929">people are willing to kind of read a lot</text>
  <text start="1916.99" dur="3.27">you know the collection of books you</text>
  <text start="1918.549" dur="2.941">have behind you and spend a lot of time</text>
  <text start="1920.26" dur="3.87">on the internet and they&amp;#39;re looking for</text>
  <text start="1921.49" dur="4.74">longevity and and solutions for their</text>
  <text start="1924.13" dur="3.57">health aches and pains and they come</text>
  <text start="1926.23" dur="3.809">across it and they&amp;#39;re willing to try it</text>
  <text start="1927.7" dur="6.18">so right now really it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1930.039" dur="5.971">user-generated demand um it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1933.88" dur="4.2">opposite of what is true for most</text>
  <text start="1936.01" dur="4.019">commercial products right so if you go</text>
  <text start="1938.08" dur="3.809">out there and you think about what is a</text>
  <text start="1940.029" dur="4.77">commercial that you&amp;#39;re gonna see on TV</text>
  <text start="1941.889" dur="5.851">that&amp;#39;s creating company driven demand</text>
  <text start="1944.799" dur="5.791">yeah right and no one is currently</text>
  <text start="1947.74" dur="5.399">driving company driven demand it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1950.59" dur="4.799">like it&amp;#39;s out there so let me just</text>
  <text start="1953.139" dur="5.311">collect that business it&amp;#39;s order-taking</text>
  <text start="1955.389" dur="4.801">basically um and so the next kind of</text>
  <text start="1958.45" dur="4.05">phase is how do we go out there and</text>
  <text start="1960.19" dur="5.07">present it to people who might not</text>
  <text start="1962.5" dur="4.799">normally bump into it well I think from</text>
  <text start="1965.26" dur="4.5">personal experience I had some plans to</text>
  <text start="1967.299" dur="4.26">grow what I had doing it what I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="1969.76" dur="4.11">here in a way that also helps fund alt</text>
  <text start="1971.559" dur="3.99">media so I was gonna I was gonna ramp</text>
  <text start="1973.87" dur="3.24">this thing up and go big I just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1975.549" dur="3.181">have the material in which to do it so</text>
  <text start="1977.11" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;ve been sort of sitting on my hands</text>
  <text start="1978.73" dur="4.829">for a while waiting on supply and demand</text>
  <text start="1980.59" dur="5.54">to catch up and I really want to to make</text>
  <text start="1983.559" dur="5.821">this product very well known to people</text>
  <text start="1986.13" dur="5.08">that&amp;#39;s I well we we briefly talked about</text>
  <text start="1989.38" dur="3.09">it let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s partner up and and and</text>
  <text start="1991.21" dur="4.23">make that happen I think that can be</text>
  <text start="1992.47" dur="4.589">really exciting and in you know we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1995.44" dur="3.63">got an expertise that we bring to the</text>
  <text start="1997.059" dur="4.261">table that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s kind of leverage</text>
  <text start="1999.07" dur="4.319">what you do well and and we&amp;#39;ll leverage</text>
  <text start="2001.32" dur="2.77">what we do well and and I think we can</text>
  <text start="2003.389" dur="2.921">do some really cool</text>
  <text start="2004.09" dur="3">yeah we&amp;#39;ll definitely need to talk about</text>
  <text start="2006.31" dur="4.11">that for sure</text>
  <text start="2007.09" dur="4.38">now at some point like we&amp;#39;ve talked sort</text>
  <text start="2010.42" dur="2.34">of about the the shortage and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2011.47" dur="3.6">going on in the market right now</text>
  <text start="2012.76" dur="5.37">do you mind touching more on the history</text>
  <text start="2015.07" dur="4.65">of where these fullerenes came from how</text>
  <text start="2018.13" dur="3.87">did we figure out that this could be</text>
  <text start="2019.72" dur="4.41">used in human health or animal studies</text>
  <text start="2022" dur="3.69">even to begin with I mean this is sort</text>
  <text start="2024.13" dur="3.93">of a lubricant right this is this is</text>
  <text start="2025.69" dur="4.2">more of an industrial anti friction</text>
  <text start="2028.06" dur="3.41">technology this is not necessarily</text>
  <text start="2029.89" dur="5.28">something people should be eating</text>
  <text start="2031.47" dur="5.35">typical yeah well in fact we used to</text>
  <text start="2035.17" dur="3.81">have not for human consumption on all of</text>
  <text start="2036.82" dur="4.77">our products and that happened in 2013</text>
  <text start="2038.98" dur="11.1">and I&amp;#39;ll talk about why that happened in</text>
  <text start="2041.59" dur="9.81">2013 just so you know the lubricant is</text>
  <text start="2050.08" dur="5.06">one of the things that it was thought to</text>
  <text start="2051.4" dur="6.96">be used for and and you can until about</text>
  <text start="2055.14" dur="5.91">2013 you can say that the biggest and</text>
  <text start="2058.36" dur="6.24">most productive use of fullerenes was</text>
  <text start="2061.05" dur="5.71">funding because it was especially in the</text>
  <text start="2064.6" dur="4.35">early days so it was discovered in 1985</text>
  <text start="2066.76" dur="4.56">by dr. Richard Smalley at Rice</text>
  <text start="2068.95" dur="6.63">University here in Houston go Houston</text>
  <text start="2071.32" dur="6.09">and I love it okay I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you a</text>
  <text start="2075.58" dur="3.33">really interesting story that I love the</text>
  <text start="2077.41" dur="3.9">back story is really the interesting</text>
  <text start="2078.91" dur="4.47">story right so there&amp;#39;s a professor who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2081.31" dur="3.66">also won the Nobel Prize for this</text>
  <text start="2083.38" dur="3.48">discovery so dr. Richard Smalley and</text>
  <text start="2084.97" dur="4.8">Harry kroto both won the proponent the</text>
  <text start="2086.86" dur="6.15">prize Nobel Prize and Harold kroto</text>
  <text start="2089.77" dur="5.13">came to Rice University and he and he</text>
  <text start="2093.01" dur="4.2">came to dr. Smalley who had this really</text>
  <text start="2094.9" dur="4.02">cool laser ablation machine so basically</text>
  <text start="2097.21" dur="3.48">you would put a sample in it you would</text>
  <text start="2098.92" dur="3.72">shoot a laser at it that would vaporize</text>
  <text start="2100.69" dur="4.14">the sampler and then they would take a</text>
  <text start="2102.64" dur="5.1">puff of inert gas and take it into a</text>
  <text start="2104.83" dur="4.38">mass spectrometer mm-hmm by taking it</text>
  <text start="2107.74" dur="4.02">into the mass spectrometer they could</text>
  <text start="2109.21" dur="5.79">actually see what was formed when it</text>
  <text start="2111.76" dur="5.13">condensed after that laser ablation dr.</text>
  <text start="2115" dur="3.99">small he was working with Titanium&amp;#39;s of</text>
  <text start="2116.89" dur="4.32">different steels really sexy stuff right</text>
  <text start="2118.99" dur="4.47">and Harold kroto is an astrophysicist</text>
  <text start="2121.21" dur="4.14">who had found some spectra way out in</text>
  <text start="2123.46" dur="4.17">space and was like I don&amp;#39;t know what it</text>
  <text start="2125.35" dur="3.12">is but it&amp;#39;s probably carbon-based hey</text>
  <text start="2127.63" dur="3.57">dr. Smalley</text>
  <text start="2128.47" dur="4.65">let&amp;#39;s put carbon and you&amp;#39;re really fancy</text>
  <text start="2131.2" dur="6.45">schmancy machine and see what happens</text>
  <text start="2133.12" dur="7.53">and dr. Smalley west no no thank you I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2137.65" dur="5.699">sexy carbon is everywhere there&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2140.65" dur="5.399">and that&amp;#39;s good yeah it&amp;#39;s cold why would</text>
  <text start="2143.349" dur="4.531">we stick carbon in this so here dr.</text>
  <text start="2146.049" dur="5.31">proto went away came back a second time</text>
  <text start="2147.88" dur="5.369">same request same response actually went</text>
  <text start="2151.359" dur="5.25">away came back on nother time so on the</text>
  <text start="2153.249" dur="5.58">third visit he makes the same request</text>
  <text start="2156.609" dur="4.321">and one of dr. Smiley&amp;#39;s graduate and</text>
  <text start="2158.829" dur="4.68">graduate students was like look you know</text>
  <text start="2160.93" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s Friday I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll put some carbon in</text>
  <text start="2163.509" dur="5.79">over the weekend and you know and we can</text>
  <text start="2165.64" dur="5.79">kind of discuss it on Monday so it&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2169.299" dur="4.891">sure it wasn&amp;#39;t behind kind of dr.</text>
  <text start="2171.43" dur="5.939">Smiley&amp;#39;s back but it was on the weekend</text>
  <text start="2174.19" dur="6.419">because weekday time was was designated</text>
  <text start="2177.369" dur="6.39">for sexier materials like titanium so he</text>
  <text start="2180.609" dur="5.94">goes in he vaporizes the grave graphite</text>
  <text start="2183.759" dur="4.11">a puff of gas to take it into the mass</text>
  <text start="2186.549" dur="3.45">spectrometer and really what the mass</text>
  <text start="2187.869" dur="4.591">spectrometer is spitting out is one two</text>
  <text start="2189.999" dur="4.921">three four five like really a line</text>
  <text start="2192.46" dur="4.92">diagram and it&amp;#39;s the line diagram of how</text>
  <text start="2194.92" dur="5.339">many carbon atoms there were in each</text>
  <text start="2197.38" dur="5.639">individual species right so this species</text>
  <text start="2200.259" dur="7.35">had ten this one at 11 this one at 12</text>
  <text start="2203.019" dur="7.47">this one had 59 this one had 60 and then</text>
  <text start="2207.609" dur="7.021">back down to 61 62 and another smaller</text>
  <text start="2210.489" dur="6.991">peak at 70 and so interestingly IBM had</text>
  <text start="2214.63" dur="5.729">the same exact results a year prior and</text>
  <text start="2217.48" dur="4.379">had dismissed it as an anomaly but this</text>
  <text start="2220.359" dur="4.26">grad student tweak the settings</text>
  <text start="2221.859" dur="5.791">different pressures and adjust it and</text>
  <text start="2224.619" dur="4.771">really got that c62 peak and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2227.65" dur="3.179">talking about sheets of graphite right</text>
  <text start="2229.39" dur="4.199">so if we&amp;#39;re talking about a sheaf of</text>
  <text start="2230.829" dur="5.01">sheet of graphite you know adding one</text>
  <text start="2233.589" dur="3.93">carbon or taking one carbon off makes</text>
  <text start="2235.839" dur="3.72">sense right you should have an even</text>
  <text start="2237.519" dur="4.8">distribution of all the numbers of</text>
  <text start="2239.559" dur="6.091">graphite sheets but for some reason</text>
  <text start="2242.319" dur="5.67">there was 60 and that 60 was a peak so</text>
  <text start="2245.65" dur="4.74">he came in on Monday saying okay I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2247.989" dur="6.78">know what this means but 60 is a</text>
  <text start="2250.39" dur="5.79">preferred configuration for this this</text>
  <text start="2254.769" dur="2.85">carbon that&amp;#39;s been a blade and then</text>
  <text start="2256.18" dur="4.26">brought into this mass spectrometer</text>
  <text start="2257.619" dur="6.301">mm-hm and so it just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="2260.44" dur="6.569">that if it&amp;#39;s a flat sheet that 60 is</text>
  <text start="2263.92" dur="5.25">more popular than 59 or 61 there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="2267.009" dur="4.1">there&amp;#39;s no logic to that it&amp;#39;s just one</text>
  <text start="2269.17" dur="4.73">or less carbon atoms</text>
  <text start="2271.109" dur="4.771">but then they put together and then and</text>
  <text start="2273.9" dur="4.05">there&amp;#39;s a good Houston Chronicle article</text>
  <text start="2275.88" dur="4.469">where they put the figure together and</text>
  <text start="2277.95" dur="5.18">he dropped dropped this Bucky ball and</text>
  <text start="2280.349" dur="5.46">it bounces dramatically on the floor a</text>
  <text start="2283.13" dur="5.139">signaling the discovery of the buckyball</text>
  <text start="2285.809" dur="5.25">right yeah and so they discovered that</text>
  <text start="2288.269" dur="5.57">in 1985 and I love that story because</text>
  <text start="2291.059" dur="6.72">maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t happen and actually</text>
  <text start="2293.839" dur="4.9">that grad student is on is on the patent</text>
  <text start="2297.779" dur="2.371">I don&amp;#39;t know if he&amp;#39;s in the know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2298.739" dur="2.641">remember he&amp;#39;s in the Nobel Prize also</text>
  <text start="2300.15" dur="4.32">but he&amp;#39;s definitely on the patent that</text>
  <text start="2301.38" dur="5.699">was very cool so that&amp;#39;s cool um so</text>
  <text start="2304.47" dur="6.21">discovered in 1985 they won the Nobel</text>
  <text start="2307.079" dur="5.821">Prize in 1996 11 years it&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="2310.68" dur="4.619">shortest timeframes for anyone to ever</text>
  <text start="2312.9" dur="5.49">win a Nobel Prize and the reason is is</text>
  <text start="2315.299" dur="5.04">it usually takes years decades for them</text>
  <text start="2318.39" dur="4.05">to go oh wow remember that that</text>
  <text start="2320.339" dur="4.71">scientific discovery that happened so</text>
  <text start="2322.44" dur="5.579">long ago that was really important right</text>
  <text start="2325.049" dur="4.861">yeah but but they knew with the</text>
  <text start="2328.019" dur="4.141">buckyball because of its kind of</text>
  <text start="2329.91" dur="4.98">association with the benzene ring that</text>
  <text start="2332.16" dur="4.349">it was an incredibly profound discovery</text>
  <text start="2334.89" dur="3.09">so within 11 years he won the Nobel</text>
  <text start="2336.509" dur="3.03">Prize and that was that was great</text>
  <text start="2337.98" dur="3.69">because he actually was able to win that</text>
  <text start="2339.539" dur="6.75">prize prior to his death because he died</text>
  <text start="2341.67" dur="7.8">of cancer shortly thereafter so so</text>
  <text start="2346.289" dur="7.46">that&amp;#39;s kind of the discovery so a and in</text>
  <text start="2349.47" dur="8.039">96 they&amp;#39;re winning the Nobel Prize in in</text>
  <text start="2353.749" dur="5.411">but before that happened in 91 my</text>
  <text start="2357.509" dur="3.121">business partners at the Texas Center</text>
  <text start="2359.16" dur="4.709">for superconductivity separate</text>
  <text start="2360.63" dur="5.189">separating these materials and and so we</text>
  <text start="2363.869" dur="6.62">formed that company we actually visited</text>
  <text start="2365.819" dur="8.821">dr. Richard Smalley&amp;#39;s facilities and</text>
  <text start="2370.489" dur="6.701">queried his postdoc graduate students to</text>
  <text start="2374.64" dur="4.74">give us ideas that they would share on</text>
  <text start="2377.19" dur="5.94">how to make the best fullerene machine</text>
  <text start="2379.38" dur="5.55">so there are influences from dr.</text>
  <text start="2383.13" dur="5.399">Smalley&amp;#39;s team in the work that we do</text>
  <text start="2384.93" dur="6.24">today so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really cool and</text>
  <text start="2388.529" dur="4.5">like I said the first purpose of full</text>
  <text start="2391.17" dur="4.199">rings was research if you were writing a</text>
  <text start="2393.029" dur="4.29">research paper on c60 you got funded</text>
  <text start="2395.369" dur="3.99">because it was incredibly sexy and the</text>
  <text start="2397.319" dur="3.661">guy just won the Nobel Prize for it so</text>
  <text start="2399.359" dur="3.031">you could get funding all over the place</text>
  <text start="2400.98" dur="3.869">and that was kind of our running joke</text>
  <text start="2402.39" dur="6.449">what&amp;#39;s it used for funding</text>
  <text start="2404.849" dur="6.48">humble coal basically close enough well</text>
  <text start="2408.839" dur="3.871">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of I mean not just in</text>
  <text start="2411.329" dur="3.841">this industry and not even just in the</text>
  <text start="2412.71" dur="3.99">health aspect but the Graphite&amp;#39;s the the</text>
  <text start="2415.17" dur="5.01">graphene&amp;#39;s those materials are really</text>
  <text start="2416.7" dur="5.129">kind of coming into attention right now</text>
  <text start="2420.18" dur="2.7">into focus I mean they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="2421.829" dur="3.03">ramp up how to make them more</text>
  <text start="2422.88" dur="5.159">efficiently and carbon is a very useful</text>
  <text start="2424.859" dur="6.571">thing I mean yes it&amp;#39;s certainly a lot</text>
  <text start="2428.039" dur="5.73">sexier than it used to be yeah right</text>
  <text start="2431.43" dur="5.639">right with all the formulations graphene</text>
  <text start="2433.769" dur="6.421">and yeah and then and you think about</text>
  <text start="2437.069" dur="6.03">what this industry is doing like c60 and</text>
  <text start="2440.19" dur="6.45">olive oil is is just it&amp;#39;s just amazing</text>
  <text start="2443.099" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just so so one of the things</text>
  <text start="2446.64" dur="6.03">that I used to say about in the early</text>
  <text start="2447.989" dur="7.32">days is that that that fullerenes or c60</text>
  <text start="2452.67" dur="5.46">in particular performs as well or better</text>
  <text start="2455.309" dur="4.8">than the current best material in almost</text>
  <text start="2458.13" dur="4.02">every application you put it in so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2460.109" dur="5.25">better ink than your ink but it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="2462.15" dur="5.129">expensive it&amp;#39;s better in tires than the</text>
  <text start="2465.359" dur="5.101">carbon black but it&amp;#39;s too expensive for</text>
  <text start="2467.279" dur="5.671">now yeah yeah right in the past for now</text>
  <text start="2470.46" dur="4.619">and at some point it might get it will</text>
  <text start="2472.95" dur="4.529">get cost of cost competitive yeah well</text>
  <text start="2475.079" dur="4.081">that we may be an inverted side effect</text>
  <text start="2477.479" dur="3.151">with some of this overproduction that</text>
  <text start="2479.16" dur="2.79">we&amp;#39;re about to see the kind of the</text>
  <text start="2480.63" dur="3.869">pendulum swinging back the other</text>
  <text start="2481.95" dur="4.68">direction from yes a little bit of the</text>
  <text start="2484.499" dur="3.901">supply crunch we ran into it could start</text>
  <text start="2486.63" dur="3.479">the chicken egg situation right it could</text>
  <text start="2488.4" dur="4.649">could could really get that egg rolling</text>
  <text start="2490.109" dur="4.86">off the off the roof right what do I do</text>
  <text start="2493.049" dur="3.81">with it all yeah yeah if I&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="2494.969" dur="3.78">bucket of it and and I need to give it</text>
  <text start="2496.859" dur="3.571">away to a researcher so that he can do</text>
  <text start="2498.749" dur="2.87">some great science and now we can start</text>
  <text start="2500.43" dur="3.359">selling it a lot less expensive</text>
  <text start="2501.619" dur="4.35">expensively also you throw in the fact</text>
  <text start="2503.789" dur="5.31">that flame synthesis and plasma</text>
  <text start="2505.969" dur="5.681">synthesis are much more scalable</text>
  <text start="2509.099" dur="4.831">technologies and and a lot of effort is</text>
  <text start="2511.65" dur="4.349">going into those so it&amp;#39;s has been but</text>
  <text start="2513.93" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s going into a mount yeah it&amp;#39;s neat</text>
  <text start="2515.999" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a space-age kind of</text>
  <text start="2518.13" dur="4.05">technology I think that&amp;#39;s fair to say</text>
  <text start="2519.569" dur="4.591">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s right in time for you know</text>
  <text start="2522.18" dur="3.689">that all of the most exciting points of</text>
  <text start="2524.16" dur="3.959">history seem to be converging right here</text>
  <text start="2525.869" dur="3.9">yeah very interesting technologies</text>
  <text start="2528.119" dur="4.011">coming out we may be exploring space</text>
  <text start="2529.769" dur="5.25">soon enough who knows</text>
  <text start="2532.13" dur="4.57">it&amp;#39;s pretty amazing right it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2535.019" dur="3.731">really amazing to come from this really</text>
  <text start="2536.7" dur="4.93">lean years</text>
  <text start="2538.75" dur="4.47">and and and I actually ended up starting</text>
  <text start="2541.63" dur="3.03">another business I own an internet</text>
  <text start="2543.22" dur="3.96">marketing business because at some point</text>
  <text start="2544.66" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s a research material we&amp;#39;ve got the</text>
  <text start="2547.18" dur="4.62">business up and running and it&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="2548.62" dur="5.16">well and so I&amp;#39;ve got time because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2551.8" dur="4.2">small market so I started into their</text>
  <text start="2553.78" dur="4.62">business and now my time is almost</text>
  <text start="2556" dur="4.83">entirely on SES research because yeah</text>
  <text start="2558.4" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s well it&amp;#39;s taking off and it</text>
  <text start="2560.83" dur="3.3">needs a lot of attention right now and</text>
  <text start="2562.45" dur="3.63">it should and I&amp;#39;m glad that you&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="2564.13" dur="3.96">to kind of help steer this progress</text>
  <text start="2566.08" dur="4.98">you&amp;#39;ve been with the industry since I</text>
  <text start="2568.09" dur="4.5">think you said 91 right 91 yeah couple</text>
  <text start="2571.06" dur="4.17">years in I mean that&amp;#39;s very early on</text>
  <text start="2572.59" dur="4.86">yeah yeah we&amp;#39;re the worst so we&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="2575.23" dur="3.81">first company that still exists to</text>
  <text start="2577.45" dur="5.43">deliver commercial quantities of carbon</text>
  <text start="2579.04" dur="5.28">nano materials so yeah yeah so it was</text>
  <text start="2582.88" dur="2.82">popular for a while and it kind of fell</text>
  <text start="2584.32" dur="3.39">out of favor and then now it&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="2585.7" dur="5.19">making a comeback because the health</text>
  <text start="2587.71" dur="4.62">thing and others yeah well and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2590.89" dur="4.26">know that we need to go in it but you</text>
  <text start="2592.33" dur="4.8">know there was the 2012 rat study rats</text>
  <text start="2595.15" dur="5.43">doubled their lives it&amp;#39;s the single</text>
  <text start="2597.13" dur="5.97">longest largest extension of life in a</text>
  <text start="2600.58" dur="3.09">mammal in history at least that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2603.1" dur="1.83">aware of</text>
  <text start="2603.67" dur="3.69">I think you&amp;#39;ve probably done some</text>
  <text start="2604.93" dur="4.98">research I haven&amp;#39;t found anything even</text>
  <text start="2607.36" dur="4.26">close to 90% how about fasting seems to</text>

  <text start="2656.65" dur="3.66">the edge right so we&amp;#39;re on the right</text>
  <text start="2658.69" dur="3.6">side of everything the first and most</text>
  <text start="2660.31" dur="3.87">important one for me was morale and I</text>
  <text start="2662.29" dur="5.01">think you probably you think we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="2664.18" dur="4.95">in tune so hey if I&amp;#39;m willing to put</text>
  <text start="2667.3" dur="4.769">this in my body and not just for the</text>
  <text start="2669.13" dur="4.829">sake of being able to sell it right</text>
  <text start="2672.069" dur="4.14">like that&amp;#39;s a different thing but I</text>
  <text start="2673.959" dur="3.51">believe it adds benefits to me and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2676.209" dur="3.66">willing to take it I believe it&amp;#39;s safe</text>
  <text start="2677.469" dur="3.99">enough to take it and my wife takes it</text>

  <text start="2681.459" dur="2.671">take it</text>
  <text start="2681.999" dur="4.11">then I&amp;#39;ll take on every day yeah I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2684.13" dur="4.679">comfortable selling it right so as long</text>
  <text start="2686.109" dur="4.89">as is that that was step one we got some</text>
  <text start="2688.809" dur="4.8">other things that that are important</text>
  <text start="2690.999" dur="4.5">kind of understanding of the FDA</text>
  <text start="2693.609" dur="5.1">understanding of the FTC and those are</text>
  <text start="2695.499" dur="5.431">very very difficult waters to navigate</text>
  <text start="2698.709" dur="4.441">so we&amp;#39;ve got a nice team to help us</text>
  <text start="2700.93" dur="3.539">navigate those appropriately I think I</text>
  <text start="2703.15" dur="5.969">have a sense of how you might feel about</text>
  <text start="2704.469" dur="9.54">those organizations they just you&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="2744.849" dur="4.86">formulations that that we&amp;#39;re excited</text>
  <text start="2747.099" dur="5.22">about so 2019 is going to be a kind of</text>
  <text start="2749.709" dur="6.24">an expansion year production-wise</text>
  <text start="2752.319" dur="5.851">of sea 60 and then production-wise of</text>
  <text start="2755.949" dur="4.53">olive oil and and so we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="2758.17" dur="4.799">excited about about what 2019 is going</text>

  <text start="2770.499" dur="4.76">interesting story it&amp;#39;s a short that I</text>
  <text start="2773.109" dur="5.25">think a lot of people might want to hide</text>
  <text start="2775.259" dur="5.95">but I I think it&amp;#39;s an interesting and</text>
  <text start="2778.359" dur="5.49">valuable story for people well sure I</text>
  <text start="2781.209" dur="6.99">mean so you&amp;#39;re talking about the whole</text>
  <text start="2783.849" dur="7.62">like Chinese market so that a little bit</text>
  <text start="2788.199" dur="5.431">of quick backstory is since everyone is</text>
  <text start="2791.469" dur="4.711">sold out right now one of the online</text>
  <text start="2793.63" dur="4.469">groups that I was in were scrounging the</text>
  <text start="2796.18" dur="3.659">online world trying to find some source</text>
  <text start="2798.099" dur="5.67">and one of them had actually done a test</text>
  <text start="2799.839" dur="4.95">on a product from a company in China and</text>
  <text start="2803.769" dur="1.951">I don&amp;#39;t know how to pronounce the whole</text>
  <text start="2804.789" dur="4.291">thing so</text>
  <text start="2805.72" dur="6.96">something life or and they had come out</text>
  <text start="2809.08" dur="5.52">okay wasn&amp;#39;t great but you know maybe</text>
  <text start="2812.68" dur="3.39">more for industrial purposes it&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="2814.6" dur="2.43">probably not something you want to put</text>
  <text start="2816.07" dur="4.59">your mouth which is what you would</text>
  <text start="2817.03" dur="6.48">expect coming from China yep um and any</text>
  <text start="2820.66" dur="4.11">food in all yeah and and at one point I</text>
  <text start="2823.51" dur="3">had reached out to them as well because</text>
  <text start="2824.77" dur="3.09">I had thought about it before the test</text>
  <text start="2826.51" dur="3.87">results came back from this group I</text>
  <text start="2827.86" dur="3.72">thought about having my own tested even</text>
  <text start="2830.38" dur="2.64">though it&amp;#39;s thousands of dollars it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2831.58" dur="3">very expensive to do that right now at</text>
  <text start="2833.02" dur="3.33">least for now</text>
  <text start="2834.58" dur="3.78">so I was on the you know if you&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="2836.35" dur="3.81">bought anything on Alibaba or Aliexpress</text>
  <text start="2838.36" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;re on the email list and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2840.16" dur="4.41">never ever ever getting off of that</text>
  <text start="2841.96" dur="4.08">right so every once in a while like on</text>
  <text start="2844.57" dur="3.03">holidays and stuff even though they may</text>
  <text start="2846.04" dur="3.72">not be even celebrate that holiday</text>
  <text start="2847.6" dur="5.61">you&amp;#39;re getting an email that in bad</text>
  <text start="2849.76" dur="4.98">Engrish you know as happy holidays</text>
  <text start="2853.21" dur="3.84">please come buy from us you know</text>
  <text start="2854.74" dur="4.11">basically yeah the short version and I</text>
  <text start="2857.05" dur="3.18">got one basically it was an image of you</text>
  <text start="2858.85" dur="4.23">and some of the guys over there from</text>
  <text start="2860.23" dur="5.28">from life are and they&amp;#39;re saying oh yeah</text>
  <text start="2863.08" dur="4.62">we basically do paraphrase it we just</text>
  <text start="2865.51" dur="3.57">closed deals with SES they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="2867.7" dur="2.96">respected you should buy from us you</text>
  <text start="2869.08" dur="5.55">know basically just one of those emails</text>
  <text start="2870.66" dur="6.49">yep and and as a oh crap does this mean</text>
  <text start="2874.63" dur="4.68">SES is buying from China so I contacted</text>
  <text start="2877.15" dur="4.44">you I contacted a mutual acquaintance of</text>
  <text start="2879.31" dur="3.63">ours who&amp;#39;s in the Austrian and it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2881.59" dur="4.65">what is going on why would they even be</text>
  <text start="2882.94" dur="4.86">doing this maybe they&amp;#39;re just buying in</text>
  <text start="2886.24" dur="2.97">and cleaning it or something maybe</text>
  <text start="2887.8" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s just a benign reason for that</text>
  <text start="2889.21" dur="5.28">but then you surprise me and you said no</text>
  <text start="2891.34" dur="4.83">we don&amp;#39;t buy from them those guys yeah</text>
  <text start="2894.49" dur="3.33">which was kind of shocking to me because</text>
  <text start="2896.17" dur="3.66">it didn&amp;#39;t make any sense why are they</text>
  <text start="2897.82" dur="4.05">picking some sort of a fight honestly</text>
  <text start="2899.83" dur="4.56">you know I don&amp;#39;t trust the Chinese</text>
  <text start="2901.87" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s this mindset I don&amp;#39;t trust the</text>
  <text start="2904.39" dur="3.09">culture I think it&amp;#39;s built around</text>
  <text start="2905.68" dur="4.11">scamming people</text>
  <text start="2907.48" dur="3.81">my wife is Taiwanese and and her dad has</text>
  <text start="2909.79" dur="2.64">been scammed multiple times by Chinese</text>
  <text start="2911.29" dur="2.46">business people he does a lot of</text>
  <text start="2912.43" dur="2.61">business in mainland China so I</text>
  <text start="2913.75" dur="3.78">definitely have no problem believing</text>
  <text start="2915.04" dur="4.2">that they are lying I just don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2917.53" dur="5.1">why they&amp;#39;re trying to start such a weird</text>
  <text start="2919.24" dur="5.37">fight with you to begin with but you</text>
  <text start="2922.63" dur="6.66">know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the backstory of what</text>
  <text start="2924.61" dur="6.57">brought us together yeah so yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="2929.29" dur="3.33">well yeah I think everything works out</text>
  <text start="2931.18" dur="3.45">and and you know kind of what I</text>
  <text start="2932.62" dur="3.54">explained like right away when when you</text>
  <text start="2934.63" dur="3.6">reached out to me and I kind of did some</text>
  <text start="2936.16" dur="3.39">research I was like oh some people will</text>
  <text start="2938.23" dur="3.36">say things and you&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="2939.55" dur="3.78">know if there&amp;#39;s because you had said hey</text>
  <text start="2941.59" dur="3.09">I&amp;#39;ve got some kind of confirm some</text>
  <text start="2943.33" dur="3.54">evidence that you guys are buying from</text>
  <text start="2944.68" dur="3.87">China and I&amp;#39;m like well you probably do</text>
  <text start="2946.87" dur="3.09">have evidence because I you know I see</text>
  <text start="2948.55" dur="4.29">your profile you&amp;#39;re the kind of guy who</text>
  <text start="2949.96" dur="6.06">goes and gets evidence or has it before</text>
  <text start="2952.84" dur="5.22">he speaks up and and like a like I wrote</text>
  <text start="2956.02" dur="4.5">kind of right away as yeah we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2958.06" dur="3.72">met with lots of people who produce so</text>
  <text start="2960.52" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;ve met with people who claim they</text>
  <text start="2961.78" dur="5.01">produce I mentioned you know a group</text>
  <text start="2965.59" dur="2.91">here in United States to enflame</text>
  <text start="2966.79" dur="4.89">synthesis we&amp;#39;ve been in this business</text>
  <text start="2968.5" dur="6.36">since 1991 I mean there&amp;#39;s a couple kind</text>
  <text start="2971.68" dur="7.32">of very cool things my business partner</text>
  <text start="2974.86" dur="6.12">Robert has had drinks with with dr.</text>
  <text start="2979" dur="3.84">Richard Smalley he was in the room it</text>
  <text start="2980.98" dur="4.44">wasn&amp;#39;t face to face but you know in the</text>
  <text start="2982.84" dur="6.05">same room actually house photos with</text>
  <text start="2985.42" dur="7.11">people who are in the science community</text>
  <text start="2988.89" dur="4.75">well-respected scientists were we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2992.53" dur="3.27">supporting members of the</text>
  <text start="2993.64" dur="6.51">electrochemical society right so we</text>
  <text start="2995.8" dur="7.53">actually have an award that that that we</text>
  <text start="3000.15" dur="5.07">sponsored for the the young rising</text>
  <text start="3003.33" dur="5.07">chemist award so they can get a</text>
  <text start="3005.22" dur="5.16">scholarship right so this is like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3008.4" dur="4.11">deep rooted in this community so if</text>
  <text start="3010.38" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s somebody who&amp;#39;s who&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="3012.51" dur="6.3">business in in the fullering market then</text>
  <text start="3015.18" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re aware of them and I don&amp;#39;t and then</text>
  <text start="3018.81" dur="3.39">you even share it actually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3020.19" dur="4.41">sharing wires and claiming that some</text>
  <text start="3022.2" dur="5.13">wires like some financial wires are</text>
  <text start="3024.6" dur="5.19">proof that were we&amp;#39;re doing business I</text>
  <text start="3027.33" dur="4.17">can say you know we&amp;#39;ve got requirements</text>
  <text start="3029.79" dur="3.96">contracts and you mentioned that their</text>
  <text start="3031.5" dur="4.56">product might be good for industrial</text>
  <text start="3033.75" dur="4.59">purposes all right hmm well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3036.06" dur="4.16">that&amp;#39;s a hundred percent true it could</text>
  <text start="3038.34" dur="4.83">be good for industrial services we</text>
  <text start="3040.22" dur="5.44">industries we actually looked at the</text>
  <text start="3043.17" dur="3.93">material thinking about potentially</text>
  <text start="3045.66" dur="3.24">filling a gap and we just weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3047.1" dur="3.15">comfortable with the oxides that were in</text>
  <text start="3048.9" dur="2.7">it right and so that it might even be</text>
  <text start="3050.25" dur="3.78">something some of the tests you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3051.6" dur="4.32">looking at aren&amp;#39;t really keen on we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3054.03" dur="3.72">looking at that kind of really granular</text>
  <text start="3055.92" dur="3.96">level of what is it that we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="3057.75" dur="3.93">that we would potentially be putting in</text>
  <text start="3059.88" dur="3.84">other people&amp;#39;s bodies right mm-hmm and</text>
  <text start="3061.68" dur="3.99">and had decided no that&amp;#39;s not the way to</text>
  <text start="3063.72" dur="4.23">go we know that there&amp;#39;s risks in the</text>
  <text start="3065.67" dur="3.75">industry by creating this void but it</text>
  <text start="3067.95" dur="3.15">would be better to do that and to</text>
  <text start="3069.42" dur="3.87">actually sell that product if that makes</text>
  <text start="3071.1" dur="3.66">it like so it&amp;#39;s a financial call</text>
  <text start="3073.29" dur="4.38">because we could turn around and sell</text>
  <text start="3074.76" dur="4.35">the material if or if I have enough</text>
  <text start="3077.67" dur="2.73">quality and even if it was high enough</text>
  <text start="3079.11" dur="2.85">quality we could turn around and sell it</text>
  <text start="3080.4" dur="2.46">it&amp;#39;s just not the right thing to do if</text>
  <text start="3081.96" dur="3.54">that makes sense</text>
  <text start="3082.86" dur="4.95">yeah I understand for sure the wires we</text>
  <text start="3085.5" dur="5.28">actually did wire them money we had a</text>
  <text start="3087.81" dur="6.21">requirements contract with with with a</text>
  <text start="3090.78" dur="6.09">company that does use c60 for industrial</text>
  <text start="3094.02" dur="4.35">purposes we were falling behind on that</text>
  <text start="3096.87" dur="3.93">requirements contract because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3098.37" dur="4.92">putting it all in this of the c60 in</text>
  <text start="3100.8" dur="3.66">olive oil and we were about to face some</text>
  <text start="3103.29" dur="3.3">penalties and they&amp;#39;re like look I</text>
  <text start="3104.46" dur="4.08">prepaid you I&amp;#39;m just gonna buy this</text>
  <text start="3106.59" dur="5.22">stuff just wear them the money I paid</text>
  <text start="3108.54" dur="6.21">you so so we did and then you end up</text>
  <text start="3111.81" dur="6.95">with a wire that oh yeah</text>
  <text start="3114.75" dur="8.31">we buy from theirs from from life are so</text>
  <text start="3118.76" dur="7.33">it&amp;#39;s frustrating yeah if I&amp;#39;m sure I can</text>
  <text start="3123.06" dur="4.26">imagine and I I honestly at this point</text>
  <text start="3126.09" dur="2.97">and you brought up another point about</text>
  <text start="3127.32" dur="3.12">the whole electro chemical thing I want</text>
  <text start="3129.06" dur="7.41">to bring that up the whole mind control</text>
  <text start="3130.44" dur="7.58">5g crowd but I would like to see more</text>

  <text start="3302.219" dur="3">like to follow</text>
  <text start="3303.269" dur="3.75">interesting new technologies that I</text>
  <text start="3305.219" dur="5.03">think could change the whole game right</text>
  <text start="3307.019" dur="6.02">that&amp;#39;s how I found c60 originally and</text>
  <text start="3310.249" dur="5.62">the search you did that kind of like</text>
  <text start="3313.039" dur="4.57">landed you in the lap of c60 if you will</text>
  <text start="3315.869" dur="3.57">yeah actually the originally it was a</text>
  <text start="3317.609" dur="3.66">Sarah Westall interview because oh yeah</text>
  <text start="3319.439" dur="4.23">use covering other topics not even</text>
  <text start="3321.269" dur="4.32">related to c60 I do look for like</text>
  <text start="3323.669" dur="5.1">game-changing technologies I&amp;#39;m a big fan</text>
  <text start="3325.589" dur="5.01">of things like that and I do interviews</text>
  <text start="3328.769" dur="5.01">in that area when I might get a chance</text>
  <text start="3330.599" dur="4.65">to but this one is the most exciting of</text>
  <text start="3333.779" dur="3.75">all of the new technologies that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3335.249" dur="3.51">seen lately you know there some people</text>
  <text start="3337.529" dur="2.971">are waiting and holding out for like</text>
  <text start="3338.759" dur="3.181">free energy devices things like that</text>
  <text start="3340.5" dur="2.73">this is this is something that I think</text>
  <text start="3341.94" dur="7.5">has a lot of evidence to back it up</text>
  <text start="3343.23" dur="8.13">already yeah yeah I so um it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="3349.44" dur="6.03">interesting world that that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3351.36" dur="6.6">navigating right because my and SES as a</text>
  <text start="3355.47" dur="6.51">company is navigating because we are at</text>
  <text start="3357.96" dur="6.72">our core scientists delivering carbon</text>
  <text start="3361.98" dur="6.09">nano materials to other scientists</text>
  <text start="3364.68" dur="7.41">around the world right since 1991 mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="3368.07" dur="7.62">and now we&amp;#39;re really supplement sales</text>
  <text start="3372.09" dur="6.24">people which I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="3375.69" dur="5.37">exact polar opposite but it feels very</text>
  <text start="3378.33" dur="4.71">much like the opposite because excites</text>
  <text start="3381.06" dur="5.61">right it&amp;#39;s very different worlds where</text>
  <text start="3383.04" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re you know I still get a little and</text>
  <text start="3386.67" dur="3.39">mate I don&amp;#39;t know if this is true for</text>
  <text start="3387.84" dur="4.53">you also but I still get a little uneasy</text>
  <text start="3390.06" dur="4.23">when people I&amp;#39;m no longer surprised but</text>
  <text start="3392.37" dur="4.44">I get a little easy uneasy when people</text>
  <text start="3394.29" dur="6.09">call it give me amazing testimonies</text>
  <text start="3396.81" dur="5.67">right yeah yes because I believe it but</text>
  <text start="3400.38" dur="3.99">I&amp;#39;m kind of not supposed to right as a</text>
  <text start="3402.48" dur="4.02">scientist was like okay that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="3404.37" dur="3.63">anecdote okay well and then and then</text>
  <text start="3406.5" dur="3.15">there&amp;#39;s another one and then then</text>
  <text start="3408" dur="3.5">there&amp;#39;s another one yeah like I said it</text>
  <text start="3409.65" dur="5.78">seems too good to be true even</text>
  <text start="3411.5" dur="6.58">absolutely and so I&amp;#39;m so leery about</text>
  <text start="3415.43" dur="7.27">about being the snake oil salesman that</text>
  <text start="3418.08" dur="6.39">makes me so uncomfortable and and and</text>
  <text start="3422.7" dur="3.9">and so it&amp;#39;s one of the things that are</text>
  <text start="3424.47" dur="3.45">very Russell one so some people give me</text>
  <text start="3426.6" dur="2.88">testimonials I&amp;#39;ll be honest some of the</text>
  <text start="3427.92" dur="4.02">testimonials are so outlandish I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="3429.48" dur="4.17">please never say that again even if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3431.94" dur="4.22">true nobody&amp;#39;s going to believe you and</text>
  <text start="3433.65" dur="5.7">then it&amp;#39;s kind of discredit everything</text>
  <text start="3436.16" dur="6.16">but it&amp;#39;s just consistent and it&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="3439.35" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s people that I know for me it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="3442.32" dur="6.12">binary so one of them is a good friend</text>
  <text start="3445.53" dur="4.41">of mine what he said actually after some</text>
  <text start="3448.44" dur="3.63">prompting so not unlike the story I told</text>
  <text start="3449.94" dur="4.62">earlier like hey we get other people</text>
  <text start="3452.07" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re experiencing this and any goes</text>
  <text start="3454.56" dur="5.91">well now that I think about it I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3457.23" dur="5.97">actually I&amp;#39;m not using my alarm clock</text>
  <text start="3460.47" dur="5.31">I used my alarm clock for 50 years and</text>
  <text start="3463.2" dur="5.04">since I&amp;#39;ve been taking c60 I no longer</text>
  <text start="3465.78" dur="4.62">need the alarm clock and so those are</text>
  <text start="3468.24" dur="5.07">very binary things right it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="3470.4" dur="3.909">yes it could bleep be placebo and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3473.31" dur="2.62">constantly aware</text>
  <text start="3474.309" dur="4.26">that possibility and that&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="3475.93" dur="4.74">that kind of concerns me but I actually</text>
  <text start="3478.569" dur="3.63">had to prompt him he wasn&amp;#39;t expecting</text>
  <text start="3480.67" dur="3.269">that benefit yeah but you wouldn&amp;#39;t also</text>
  <text start="3482.199" dur="3.24">the placebo thing wouldn&amp;#39;t explain all</text>
  <text start="3483.939" dur="3.75">the animal studies right yes</text>
  <text start="3485.439" dur="4.8">yeah you&amp;#39;re a hundred percent right so</text>
  <text start="3487.689" dur="5.941">so yeah the study animal studies are</text>
  <text start="3490.239" dur="4.83">doing really well and and yeah yes we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3493.63" dur="3.059">recently developed a greater</text>
  <text start="3495.069" dur="6.12">understanding of the the mind-body</text>
  <text start="3496.689" dur="8.731">connection and wraps you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3501.189" dur="7.05">hypnotizing you you are healthier yeah</text>
  <text start="3505.42" dur="5.699">they had a in addition to the c60 they</text>
  <text start="3508.239" dur="6.6">had an extra hour of massage every day</text>
  <text start="3511.119" dur="5.311">so that was the differentiation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3514.839" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s interesting because some people</text>
  <text start="3516.43" dur="4.829">have complained and I you know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3518.769" dur="4.29">legitimate complaint right it was a very</text>
  <text start="3521.259" dur="5.55">small test group like six six six rats</text>
  <text start="3523.059" dur="7.71">um but they live twice as long right so</text>
  <text start="3526.809" dur="6.121">it is the complaint that that one like</text>
  <text start="3530.769" dur="5.31">one rat doesn&amp;#39;t live sixty two months</text>
  <text start="3532.93" dur="5.399">like that that doesn&amp;#39;t happen right this</text>
  <text start="3536.079" dur="4.26">is six rats that lived sixty two months</text>
  <text start="3538.329" dur="3.87">and these are bred to be lakeshore lived</text>
  <text start="3540.339" dur="3.811">right in two months like they&amp;#39;ve minutes</text>
  <text start="3542.199" dur="4.79">to thirty two months they have whatever</text>
  <text start="3544.15" dur="5.879">two point four grams of tumors in them</text>
  <text start="3546.989" dur="4.51">the rafts in the study lives in fact</text>
  <text start="3550.029" dur="4.41">they had to kill the last one they lived</text>
  <text start="3551.499" dur="6.35">sixty two months and you get kind of on</text>
  <text start="3554.439" dur="8.07">average and they didn&amp;#39;t have any tumors</text>
  <text start="3557.849" dur="6.19">right so these are a yes I get the</text>
  <text start="3562.509" dur="6.06">scientific critique and we need to stay</text>
  <text start="3564.039" dur="6.841">very rooted and did did somebody swap</text>
  <text start="3568.569" dur="4.74">out the rats like where how do we get</text>
  <text start="3570.88" dur="3.869">from it&amp;#39;s a just oh it&amp;#39;s just how do you</text>
  <text start="3573.309" dur="4.37">get from thirty two months to sixty two</text>
  <text start="3574.749" dur="4.651">months on a normal or whisker rat and I</text>
  <text start="3577.679" dur="4.15">don&amp;#39;t know the answer to</text>
  <text start="3579.4" dur="5.339">yeah it gives I think it gives some</text>
  <text start="3581.829" dur="4.2">credibility to the report yeah I wish it</text>
  <text start="3584.739" dur="3.21">was if it was cheaper I could I have a</text>
  <text start="3586.029" dur="4.141">herd of rabbits I could do all sorts of</text>
  <text start="3587.949" dur="5.04">interesting at least you know DIY</text>
  <text start="3590.17" dur="4.559">studies maybe not as and maybe even I</text>
  <text start="3592.989" dur="2.88">wish that there would be because the FDA</text>
  <text start="3594.729" dur="3.12">let&amp;#39;s be honest they&amp;#39;re never gonna</text>
  <text start="3595.869" dur="3.541">approve this I wish there was a website</text>
  <text start="3597.849" dur="4.41">set up where people could learn how to</text>
  <text start="3599.41" dur="5.879">be as scientific as possible and maybe</text>
  <text start="3602.259" dur="4.401">make their their DIY experimentation</text>
  <text start="3605.289" dur="4.401">useful for the larger sign</text>
  <text start="3606.66" dur="4.29">because I give it to some some</text>
  <text start="3609.69" dur="3.36">credibility so that I could be</text>
  <text start="3610.95" dur="3.75">incorporate that&amp;#39;s a great idea to get</text>
  <text start="3613.05" dur="4.82">it incorporated into the literature or</text>
  <text start="3614.7" dur="5.37">at least you almost have like</text>
  <text start="3617.87" dur="5.32">peer-reviewed and then you could have</text>
  <text start="3620.07" dur="5.1">internet reviewed which is you know</text>
  <text start="3623.19" dur="3.42">maybe that&amp;#39;s not the right nomenclature</text>
  <text start="3625.17" dur="3.87">but you know whatever following some</text>
  <text start="3626.61" dur="3.9">standard and then then the rest right</text>
  <text start="3629.04" dur="3.27">yeah it&amp;#39;d be a lot stronger than the</text>
  <text start="3630.51" dur="3.18">typical look I just feel so much better</text>
  <text start="3632.31" dur="3.21">because this isn&amp;#39;t this people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3633.69" dur="4.86">know how to do a real scientific report</text>
  <text start="3635.52" dur="5.46">and yeah yeah yeah I mean we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3638.55" dur="3.39">created a pre-workout formula and so</text>
  <text start="3640.98" dur="3.6">most of the people that we know are</text>
  <text start="3641.94" dur="4.62">already taking c60 so we&amp;#39;ve got a like</text>
  <text start="3644.58" dur="3.69">round of a couple of people are like hey</text>
  <text start="3646.56" dur="3.6">you want to do this and see if we get</text>
  <text start="3648.27" dur="3.36">something that word that makes us</text>
  <text start="3650.16" dur="4.65">comfortable with the product now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3651.63" dur="5.01">got C 60 and an oil in it so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="3654.81" dur="3.57">really concerned about it but you know</text>
  <text start="3656.64" dur="3.78">definitely want to do like one or two</text>
  <text start="3658.38" dur="4.55">tests have you do you work out have you</text>
  <text start="3660.42" dur="4.59">noticed any benefits working out umm I</text>
  <text start="3662.93" dur="3.52">mostly I said too much and I recently</text>
  <text start="3665.01" dur="3.87">got this really nice standing desk</text>
  <text start="3666.45" dur="3.9">because of the whole I probably do 100</text>
  <text start="3668.88" dur="3.78">hours plus a week on this on the YouTube</text>
  <text start="3670.35" dur="4.11">thing right now with right but I do have</text>
  <text start="3672.66" dur="3.96">a pull-up bar I realize I don&amp;#39;t stay</text>

  <text start="3725.73" dur="3.27">all of that so I&amp;#39;m always very cautious</text>
  <text start="3727.59" dur="2.82">about that kind of thing you still need</text>
  <text start="3729" dur="2.82">all the nutrition that you need your</text>

  <text start="3741.729" dur="4.14">the price goes down and you know when it</text>
  <text start="3744.099" dur="5.99">goes so much cheaper that it becomes a</text>
  <text start="3745.869" dur="6.66">common pet item imagine that it will</text>
  <text start="3750.089" dur="4.45">that&amp;#39;ll happen I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="3752.529" dur="3.42">know that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re working towards</text>
  <text start="3754.539" dur="3.3">and that&amp;#39;ll that&amp;#39;ll definitely happen</text>
  <text start="3755.949" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;ll take a while it probably won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="3757.839" dur="4.38">in the next year but it&amp;#39;ll happen and I</text>
  <text start="3760.509" dur="6.18">think it&amp;#39;s gonna it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="3762.219" dur="8.34">accelerate as as as more kind of</text>
  <text start="3766.689" dur="7.201">peer-reviewed work on human trials</text>
  <text start="3770.559" dur="5.071">starts coming out so we currently don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3773.89" dur="4.74">have any plans to do human trials we&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="3775.63" dur="6">like to they&amp;#39;re insanely expensive but</text>
  <text start="3778.63" dur="5.639">we do have plans to follow some of there</text>
  <text start="3781.63" dur="4.29">are some guidelines that the FDA tells</text>
  <text start="3784.269" dur="3.361">other people and so we&amp;#39;re really going</text>
  <text start="3785.92" dur="5.159">to follow those guidelines we want to</text>
  <text start="3787.63" dur="6.089">invest and and have more confidence both</text>
  <text start="3791.079" dur="4.23">for us and for the community that the</text>
  <text start="3793.719" dur="2.97">materials safe I believe it is we</text>
  <text start="3795.309" dur="4.23">believe it is already there&amp;#39;s lots of</text>
  <text start="3796.689" dur="5.67">lots of reasons to believe that but to</text>
  <text start="3799.539" dur="4.621">just take it one step above or that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3802.359" dur="3.57">what that&amp;#39;s what our next step is I can</text>
  <text start="3804.16" dur="3.449">put in a request you know if maybe get a</text>
  <text start="3805.929" dur="4.201">chance let us know how safe it is for</text>
  <text start="3807.609" dur="4.291">pregnant and nursing mothers I&amp;#39;d be kind</text>
  <text start="3810.13" dur="3.449">of neat yeah so we&amp;#39;ve had that question</text>
  <text start="3811.9" dur="3.839">a couple of times and we&amp;#39;ve thought</text>
  <text start="3813.579" dur="5.551">about like what does the study even look</text>
  <text start="3815.739" dur="4.681">like you know you do you have rats and</text>
  <text start="3819.13" dur="3.149">they get pregnant and you got to watch</text>
  <text start="3820.42" dur="3.779">their offspring and how many layers of</text>
  <text start="3822.279" dur="3.65">offspring do you it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a really</text>
  <text start="3824.199" dur="5.461">complicated issue I actually don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="3825.929" dur="7.54">we don&amp;#39;t know the answer to that and I</text>
  <text start="3829.66" dur="6.809">think in general it&amp;#39;s just so formative</text>
  <text start="3833.469" dur="5.28">I have a sense that it&amp;#39;s probably okay</text>
  <text start="3836.469" dur="5.31">and beneficial but I&amp;#39;m with you I</text>
  <text start="3838.749" dur="5.04">wouldn&amp;#39;t I would not in nursing not and</text>
  <text start="3841.779" dur="4.23">I wouldn&amp;#39;t just I&amp;#39;m in a weird situation</text>
  <text start="3843.789" dur="4.44">now I have a nine and a half month old</text>
  <text start="3846.009" dur="4.651">so my wife is afraid gratulations that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="3861.429" dur="4.17">a good problem to have so you know this</text>
  <text start="3863.229" dur="6.27">is totally in jest but I think the joke</text>
  <text start="3865.599" dur="5.4">is well I don&amp;#39;t know my business partner</text>
  <text start="3869.499" dur="4.371">what might want not want me to tell it</text>

  <text start="3873.87" dur="5.01">the toyed around with the idea of of a</text>

  <text start="3879.81" dur="7.17">non-transferable yeah nice so we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="3884.88" dur="3.81">going to do that right so but it is kind</text>
  <text start="3886.98" dur="3.95">of funny because you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3888.69" dur="6.57">kind of it would be an immeasurable</text>
  <text start="3890.93" dur="6.79">situation so yeah but we&amp;#39;re excited very</text>
  <text start="3895.26" dur="5.1">excited the possibility of living I</text>
  <text start="3897.72" dur="5.43">think we&amp;#39;ve done the calculations you</text>
  <text start="3900.36" dur="5.52">could get 258 do you have like an age</text>
  <text start="3903.15" dur="4.2">target I actually between this and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3905.88" dur="4.74">doing some other things as well like the</text>
  <text start="3907.35" dur="5.49">resveratrol some of the I&amp;#39;m trying to do</text>
  <text start="3910.62" dur="4.92">pulsed ketogenic with intermittent</text>
  <text start="3912.84" dur="4.92">fasting some of those advantages as well</text>
  <text start="3915.54" dur="4.17">so I&amp;#39;m hoping to hit 150 at least I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3917.76" dur="4.8">I&amp;#39;m not gonna get you know my hopes up</text>
  <text start="3919.71" dur="5.1">and maybe me disappointment but 200</text>
  <text start="3922.56" dur="3.87">maybe and maybe by then you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3924.81" dur="4.44">gonna be some new technology as well so</text>
  <text start="3926.43" dur="4.8">200 would be possible and isn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="3929.25" dur="3.75">crazy to even say that we&amp;#39;re for even</text>
  <text start="3931.23" dur="5.04">having that conversation right now you</text>
  <text start="3933" dur="5.7">know yeah it&amp;#39;s yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s incredibly</text>
  <text start="3936.27" dur="5.28">exciting yeah most exciting time to be</text>
  <text start="3938.7" dur="3.96">alive ever I think so where do you see</text>
  <text start="3941.55" dur="2.67">the market going I know in some</text>
  <text start="3942.66" dur="7.53">countries they&amp;#39;ve got like beauty</text>
  <text start="3944.22" dur="7.53">products and stuff yes so and actually</text>
  <text start="3950.19" dur="3.45">watched your video because I hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3951.75" dur="3.93">spent much time kind of on VD products</text>
  <text start="3953.64" dur="4.2">people asked us regularly you know can</text>
  <text start="3955.68" dur="5.37">we put it in creams and lotions and yeah</text>
  <text start="3957.84" dur="8.49">and I was a little you know vanity is a</text>
  <text start="3961.05" dur="7.38">big seller absolutely so so so it kind</text>
  <text start="3966.33" dur="5.4">of hadn&amp;#39;t really delved into that side</text>
  <text start="3968.43" dur="6.03">of things so yeah I think it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="3971.73" dur="5.09">have advantages there I think I think</text>
  <text start="3974.46" dur="5.16">just you know just consuming it is gonna</text>
  <text start="3976.82" dur="4.48">create a healthier appearance and I</text>
  <text start="3979.62" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t know where it&amp;#39;s gonna take a while</text>
  <text start="3981.3" dur="4.86">really to understand that but but yeah</text>
  <text start="3984.69" dur="5.34">putting it on your skin is known I think</text>
  <text start="3986.16" dur="6.87">to help with wrinkles I think it to help</text>
  <text start="3990.03" dur="5.73">with sunburn almost a 90% reduction was</text>
  <text start="3993.03" dur="4.26">recorded in acne in that one study so oh</text>
  <text start="3995.76" dur="2.76">yeah alone</text>
  <text start="3997.29" dur="3.12">would be a mole probably</text>
  <text start="3998.52" dur="4.62">multibillion-dollar industry really like</text>
  <text start="4000.41" dur="5.399">saving the psyches of teenagers across</text>

  <text start="4015.68" dur="5.099">the price well just having something</text>
  <text start="4018.68" dur="5.549">that is not associated with all of those</text>
  <text start="4020.779" dur="5.34">long-term liver toxic benefits all these</text>
  <text start="4024.229" dur="4.02">chemicals things like that you know</text>
  <text start="4026.119" dur="4.32">people are scared of the Nano thing but</text>
  <text start="4028.249" dur="3.99">I&amp;#39;m more comfortable with just more of</text>
  <text start="4030.439" dur="3.961">an inert carbon than I am with some of</text>
  <text start="4032.239" dur="4.26">these toxic chemicals our bodies cannot</text>
  <text start="4034.4" dur="4.559">handle yeah that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="4036.499" dur="4.651">point like carbon is just in earth I</text>
  <text start="4038.959" dur="3.6">could say and tell you in fact any any</text>
  <text start="4041.15" dur="4.77">research you do in the literature that</text>
  <text start="4042.559" dur="6.78">talks about some ill effects toxic</text>
  <text start="4045.92" dur="6.659">effects associated with carbon 60 is one</text>
  <text start="4049.339" dur="5.46">of two cases one of it&amp;#39;s been turned</text>
  <text start="4052.579" dur="5.101">into something that&amp;#39;s water soluble so</text>
  <text start="4054.799" dur="4.89">you&amp;#39;ve added some chemical composition</text>
  <text start="4057.68" dur="5.429">to the exterior to the external</text>
  <text start="4059.689" dur="8.191">buckyball and and that turns out to be</text>
  <text start="4063.109" dur="7.11">toxic or it was made with c60 that</text>
  <text start="4067.88" dur="4.26">wasn&amp;#39;t clean right so if you don&amp;#39;t all</text>
  <text start="4070.219" dur="3.451">remove the solvents then you&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="4072.14" dur="3.359">putting solvents in there and solvents</text>
  <text start="4073.67" dur="3.99">are literally a necessary part of it</text>
  <text start="4075.499" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re also part of a lot of plant</text>
  <text start="4077.66" dur="4.649">extracts I don&amp;#39;t know if you know that</text>
  <text start="4079.519" dur="4.68">but a lot of plant extracts are solvents</text>
  <text start="4082.309" dur="4.17">are utilized in those processes so that</text>
  <text start="4084.199" dur="4.17">the chemistry and and the understanding</text>
  <text start="4086.479" dur="3.36">of how to remove solvents is not it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4088.369" dur="5.13">not rocket science it&amp;#39;s used on a</text>
  <text start="4089.839" dur="5.22">regular basis you know so but those work</text>
  <text start="4093.499" dur="4.95">that&amp;#39;s the only thing in the literature</text>
  <text start="4095.059" dur="4.921">that shows detrimental effects of c60 so</text>
  <text start="4098.449" dur="4.531">but some of the solvents themselves can</text>
  <text start="4099.98" dur="5.31">be pretty toxic li toluene or something</text>
  <text start="4102.98" dur="6.329">for example toluene yeah it&amp;#39;s great in</text>
  <text start="4105.29" dur="5.159">your car yeah yeah you don&amp;#39;t want to put</text>
  <text start="4109.309" dur="3.05">it in your body you want to make sure</text>
  <text start="4110.449" dur="6.96">that you&amp;#39;re like in our case in fact</text>
  <text start="4112.359" dur="6.7">early early in 20 year again kind of</text>
  <text start="4117.409" dur="2.91">after pulling back and saying is this</text>
  <text start="4119.059" dur="3.901">something that we&amp;#39;re gonna sell and</text>
  <text start="4120.319" dur="4.86">really realizing that the quantity of</text>
  <text start="4122.96" dur="4.109">c60 we&amp;#39;re selling was going up and we</text>
  <text start="4125.179" dur="4.261">started paying attention to what people</text>
  <text start="4127.069" dur="4.38">were buying and we were actually we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="4129.44" dur="3.96">got some testimonials on on google to</text>
  <text start="4131.449" dur="4.741">support this we were actually calling</text>
  <text start="4133.4" dur="5.31">people who were buying this is the word</text>
  <text start="4136.19" dur="3.359">here&amp;#39;s the most extreme example I was on</text>
  <text start="4138.71" dur="2.73">the phone with a</text>
  <text start="4139.549" dur="3.391">to the customer I told them you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4141.44" dur="2.969">want to buy that material because I have</text>
  <text start="4142.94" dur="3.48">solvents in it you want to buy this</text>
  <text start="4144.409" dur="5.881">material one or two we had two at the</text>
  <text start="4146.42" dur="5.85">time and I saw his order come in and he</text>
  <text start="4150.29" dur="4.23">had purchased the one with solvents in</text>
  <text start="4152.27" dur="4.38">it so I immediately called him back I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4154.52" dur="3.929">like you purchased the wrong one what</text>
  <text start="4156.65" dur="4.739">happened and he goes oh I just got</text>
  <text start="4158.449" dur="4.86">confused and so we deleted that order</text>
  <text start="4161.389" dur="3.87">and he purchased the right material so</text>
  <text start="4163.309" dur="4.68">we actually made it a company policy</text>
  <text start="4165.259" dur="4.741">when we had both products online if</text>
  <text start="4167.989" dur="4.02">somebody was ordering a subversion that</text>
  <text start="4170" dur="3.659">still had solvents in it we would call</text>
  <text start="4172.009" dur="4.141">them and ask them what they were doing</text>
  <text start="4173.659" dur="3.81">it and with it and we would not sell it</text>
  <text start="4176.15" dur="4.5">to them if they were going to put it in</text>
  <text start="4177.469" dur="5.13">olive oil yeah because that stuff can be</text>
  <text start="4180.65" dur="5.069">quite toxic and having an equipment that</text>
  <text start="4182.599" dur="5.52">a vacuum oven you know that that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4185.719" dur="4.5">expensive I&amp;#39;ve looked into it yeah make</text>
  <text start="4188.119" dur="3.69">and it makes a big different we actually</text>
  <text start="4190.219" dur="5.221">wash ours also there&amp;#39;s kind of an</text>
  <text start="4191.809" dur="5.731">additional step for us but yeah like you</text>
