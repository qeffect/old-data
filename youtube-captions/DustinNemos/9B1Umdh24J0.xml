  <text start="3.51" dur="3.139">little out of breath</text>
  <text start="4.23" dur="4.619">I&amp;#39;ve been scraping and scraping and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="6.649" dur="5.95">just kind of taking a break to show you</text>
  <text start="8.849" dur="7.171">guys a little bit of the fun slash</text>
  <text start="12.599" dur="8.19">wonder slash kind of labor of love of</text>
  <text start="16.02" dur="7.2">having little rabbits around this little</text>
  <text start="20.789" dur="4.101">guy here is like the smallest one I have</text>
  <text start="23.22" dur="5.059">he&amp;#39;s sort of a new runt of the litter</text>
  <text start="24.89" dur="6.61">but I have a whole herd I mean I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="28.279" dur="7.241">quite a few now I&amp;#39;m up to about 30 or so</text>
  <text start="31.5" dur="6.75">kind of just roughly guessing you can</text>
  <text start="35.52" dur="3.78">see I&amp;#39;ve got some cushy nest boxes for</text>
  <text start="38.25" dur="3">them and that&amp;#39;s where most of them</text>
  <text start="39.3" dur="4.02">choose to have their babies now and of</text>
  <text start="41.25" dur="4.77">course on top I&amp;#39;ve got plenty of</text>
  <text start="43.32" dur="6.63">insulation that maintains being dry all</text>
  <text start="46.02" dur="6.859">year this is some of the rough stuff</text>
  <text start="49.95" dur="6.269">I&amp;#39;ve been working on now gathering out</text>
  <text start="52.879" dur="6.131">I&amp;#39;ve got them on a sort of more of a</text>
  <text start="56.219" dur="5.221">chicken waterer but I did switch the</text>
  <text start="59.01" dur="5.46">cable out for something that&amp;#39;s armoured</text>
  <text start="61.44" dur="6.12">and metal so they won&amp;#39;t you through it</text>
  <text start="64.47" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s a problem with rabbits I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="3.629">it kind of protected where it&amp;#39;s spliced</text>
  <text start="69.18" dur="5.91">in there so they can&amp;#39;t get to it and</text>
  <text start="71.189" dur="4.771">chew it up with a rock I switched to the</text>
  <text start="75.09" dur="3.62">colony method</text>
  <text start="75.96" dur="6.12">there&amp;#39;s hachi of course he&amp;#39;s curious</text>
  <text start="78.71" dur="6.01">wants to play I switched from the cage</text>
  <text start="82.08" dur="5.429">method to the colony method all together</text>
  <text start="84.72" dur="6.899">on the floor mainly because of</text>
  <text start="87.509" dur="6.511">temperature it gets pretty cold here</text>
  <text start="91.619" dur="4.64">even for rabbits which are sort of a</text>
  <text start="94.02" dur="4.709">cold breed to begin with especially</text>
  <text start="96.259" dur="5.951">these big hearty meat breeds and these</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="4.621">are mostly new zealand&amp;#39;s which are</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="3.21">usually white but they come in different</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="4.769">colors like black blue and grey and</text>
  <text start="105.42" dur="4.47">things like that my blue is actually</text>
  <text start="108.119" dur="4.53">homesick right now he&amp;#39;s my main buck</text>
  <text start="109.89" dur="4.92">he&amp;#39;s got in your infection so it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="112.649" dur="4.891">sort of the the joys of being a rabbit</text>
  <text start="114.81" dur="4.76">owner they do tend to get a little bit</text>
  <text start="117.54" dur="4.56">less sick in cages because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="119.57" dur="4.509">separated from their their droppings</text>
  <text start="122.1" dur="3.32">which has most of the problem bacteria</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="6.001">in it</text>
  <text start="125.42" dur="5.98">however they definitely love you know</text>
  <text start="130.08" dur="3.12">being together and being able to cuddle</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="4.05">at night and all of that so</text>
  <text start="133.2" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s a little bit of both here I like</text>
  <text start="135.45" dur="3.18">being able to control things with a you</text>
  <text start="137.64" dur="2.73">know and these are really well made</text>
  <text start="138.63" dur="3.96">cages I did myself I did some research</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="6.12">on them and now has certain features</text>
  <text start="142.59" dur="5.52">like you know the nesting box because</text>
  <text start="146.49" dur="3.93">their instinct is to go underground so</text>
  <text start="148.11" dur="4.11">one of these boxes right here with a</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="3.45">plastic liner on the bottom is really</text>
  <text start="152.22" dur="4.92">great if you stuff it full of straw or</text>
  <text start="153.87" dur="5.61">something for a birthing box all in one</text>
  <text start="157.14" dur="3.63">cage so really neat it keeps them from</text>
  <text start="159.48" dur="3.96">getting out and crawling through these</text>
  <text start="160.77" dur="5.64">larger wires on the outside because they</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="6.12">have of course smaller gauge or smaller</text>
  <text start="166.41" dur="5.49">spacings on this baby box down here</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="3.87">below which I even I even extra</text>
  <text start="171.9" dur="3.6">insulated for winter to try to get them</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="6.029">to stay in the boxes over winter but</text>
  <text start="175.5" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s just too cold here but that&amp;#39;s it I</text>
  <text start="179.459" dur="3.211">mean there are definitely some</text>
  <text start="180.42" dur="4.53">advantages to both if you&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="182.67" dur="4.92">into rabbits we&amp;#39;ll have to kind of make</text>
  <text start="184.95" dur="5.009">up your own mind about you know and do</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="4.29">your research about which one you prefer</text>
  <text start="189.959" dur="3.381">I&amp;#39;m kind of an animal lover and I like</text>
  <text start="191.88" dur="5.94">to see them as much as possible</text>
  <text start="193.34" dur="6.28">simulating their natural habitat hi to</text>
  <text start="197.82" dur="4.08">you that&amp;#39;s not for you buddy you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="199.62" dur="5.07">get in there I made it so you can</text>
  <text start="201.9" dur="5.1">actually he might try that breed of dog</text>
  <text start="204.69" dur="4.829">was was raised to go and tunnels after</text>
  <text start="207" dur="5">prey so he may actually try and like</text>
  <text start="209.519" dur="6.181">he&amp;#39;s a kind of a hunter and a digger</text>
  <text start="212" dur="8.769">he&amp;#39;s going for it he&amp;#39;s found something</text>
  <text start="215.7" dur="7.92">to sniff this is actually comedic golden</text>
  <text start="220.769" dur="6.75">this is perfect she I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="7.95">gonna make it man you&amp;#39;re just too deep</text>
  <text start="227.519" dur="5.31">chested nowadays I think he&amp;#39;s gotten a</text>
  <text start="231.57" dur="3.09">little thicker since we came up to the</text>
  <text start="232.829" dur="5.801">cold north</text>
  <text start="234.66" dur="6.28">you know and you&amp;#39;ve got I&amp;#39;ve got an</text>
  <text start="238.63" dur="3.39">outdoor space for them ideally you know</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="3.75">right now everything is just white</text>
  <text start="242.02" dur="5.93">outside it&amp;#39;s all winter land and tons of</text>
  <text start="244.69" dur="6.42">snow everywhere but in spring in summer</text>
  <text start="247.95" dur="5.05">warmer months it would be pretty cool to</text>
  <text start="251.11" dur="3.27">have them outdoors I do have to deal</text>
  <text start="253" dur="4.76">with a predator issue here there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="254.38" dur="6.48">sort of a like a weasel relative up here</text>
  <text start="257.76" dur="5.71">eating or drinking their blood if I let</text>
  <text start="260.86" dur="6.06">them out into the open kind of caged</text>
  <text start="263.47" dur="4.89">area but once I deal with that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="266.92" dur="3.93">gonna have a really cool outdoor area</text>
  <text start="268.36" dur="3.96">which will help help separate them from</text>
  <text start="270.85" dur="2.85">a lot of the the problems of the</text>
  <text start="272.32" dur="3.78">parasites and stuff because it&amp;#39;ll really</text>
  <text start="273.7" dur="5.76">spread that out it&amp;#39;ll give them a lot</text>
  <text start="276.1" dur="4.68">more you know social interaction</text>
  <text start="279.46" dur="2.64">exercise that kind of stuff because</text>
  <text start="280.78" dur="3.66">right now they&amp;#39;re all sort of cramped in</text>
  <text start="282.1" dur="5.88">two rooms the size which is plenty big</text>
  <text start="284.44" dur="4.71">for rabbits needs but you know everybody</text>
  <text start="287.98" dur="2.88">gets the winter blues when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="4.35">crammed in a kind of a cabin fever</text>
  <text start="290.86" dur="5.37">situation anyway I&amp;#39;m not gonna drone on</text>
  <text start="293.5" dur="6.27">forever like rabbits are of course a</text>
  <text start="296.23" dur="5.49">really fascinating animal especially</text>
  <text start="299.77" dur="6.17">from a meat perspective but even from a</text>
  <text start="301.72" dur="7.65">kind of a social or pet perspective and</text>
  <text start="305.94" dur="4.75">definitely something to to check into</text>
  <text start="309.37" dur="4.2">having because it&amp;#39;s just kind of a</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="5.04">pleasure to to raise animals and and</text>
  <text start="313.57" dur="5.25">just have some level of that interaction</text>
  <text start="315.73" dur="6.87">with you know the farm or the cycle of</text>
  <text start="318.82" dur="6.6">life lifestyle and rabbits are something</text>
  <text start="322.6" dur="5.1">even even in an apartment setting in</text>
  <text start="325.42" dur="3.57">theory you could do it I probably want</text>
  <text start="327.7" dur="3">to install some sort of like an air</text>
  <text start="328.99" dur="4.26">filter to to keep the urine smell down</text>
  <text start="330.7" dur="3.69">but you know they make good pets they</text>
  <text start="333.25" dur="3.66">could be house-trained and all of that</text>
  <text start="334.39" dur="6.24">but they&amp;#39;re not very noisy and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="336.91" dur="5.7">not very troublesome as long as you keep</text>
  <text start="340.63" dur="4.05">them in a closed setting they can escape</text>
  <text start="342.61" dur="5.85">and and they can of course go crazy with</text>
  <text start="344.68" dur="7.11">breeding and eat gardens overnight that</text>
  <text start="348.46" dur="4.38">kind of thing yes I&amp;#39;m looking at you but</text>
  <text start="351.79" dur="2.43">I think that&amp;#39;s enough for now if you</text>
  <text start="352.84" dur="3.99">guys are curious about more of this I&amp;#39;d</text>
