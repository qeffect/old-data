  <text start="352.96" dur="3.15">there&amp;#39;s all these different reasons the</text>
  <text start="354.43" dur="3.36">truth is that I was forced out because I</text>
  <text start="356.11" dur="3.96">was leading a wide-ranging corruption</text>
  <text start="357.79" dur="4.68">probe into verismo Holdings or yzma a</text>
  <text start="360.07" dur="4.41">natural-gas firm active in Ukraine Joe</text>
  <text start="362.47" dur="3.75">Biden&amp;#39;s son hunter Biden was a member of</text>

  <text start="367.87" dur="4.41">extraction had the support of the US</text>
  <text start="370" dur="4.08">Vice President Joe Biden because his son</text>
  <text start="372.28" dur="4.47">was on the board of directors so folks</text>

  <text start="380.53" dur="5.34">investigator I guess on this corruption</text>
  <text start="382.9" dur="4.74">issue he was he was chasing down the</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="3.72">leads he was getting close to two</text>
  <text start="387.64" dur="4.38">Biden&amp;#39;s son and remember that also</text>
  <text start="389.59" dur="3.99">includes Kerry&amp;#39;s son whitey Bulger&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.02" dur="4.26">nephew which is a very strange</text>
  <text start="393.58" dur="4.2">combination and and then like I said</text>
  <text start="396.28" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s connections to Romney now as</text>
  <text start="397.78" dur="5.22">well so this this this thing is blowing</text>

  <text start="485.92" dur="4.74">itself so you know it doesn&amp;#39;t make a lot</text>
  <text start="488.92" dur="3.54">of sense furthermore obviously the</text>
  <text start="490.66" dur="3.78">whistleblower was going off of hearsay</text>
  <text start="492.46" dur="4.37">rumors and fake news articles from the</text>
  <text start="494.44" dur="4.68">mainstream media so it&amp;#39;s not like I</text>
  <text start="496.83" dur="3.22">really love to see that people don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="511.54" dur="3.689">out to try to end him so you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.67" dur="4.2">one of the beautiful things now too but</text>
  <text start="515.229" dur="4.561">this this sort of and I and I hate to to</text>
  <text start="517.87" dur="5.01">call it this and I probably very vulgar</text>
  <text start="519.79" dur="4.86">but it seems to me like a circle jerk it</text>
  <text start="522.88" dur="3.03">really does it seems to be like the</text>
  <text start="524.65" dur="2.7">mainstream media the intelligence</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="3.03">communities are just so embedded with</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="4.26">each other that they&amp;#39;re just sitting</text>
  <text start="528.94" dur="4.86">there sort of in a mental masturbatory</text>
  <text start="531.61" dur="3.27">rotation you know that&amp;#39;s all it seems</text>
  <text start="533.8" dur="2.61">like they&amp;#39;re just like self</text>
  <text start="534.88" dur="3.69">congratulating each other with their</text>
  <text start="536.41" dur="4.2">their amazingness for example the Greta</text>
  <text start="538.57" dur="3.9">girl with her alternative Nobel Prize</text>
  <text start="540.61" dur="2.82">right so these are the things that they</text>
  <text start="542.47" dur="2.97">do they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="543.43" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re constantly bouncing off of each</text>
  <text start="545.44" dur="4.38">other they&amp;#39;re constantly using the</text>
  <text start="546.73" dur="4.89">credibility of themselves so for example</text>
  <text start="549.82" dur="4.47">the New York Times as an article you</text>
  <text start="551.62" dur="4.62">know Washington Post ABC CNN and a bunch</text>

  <text start="1303.02" dur="2.7">always want more violence used against</text>
  <text start="1304.429" dur="2.671">people that disagree with that like if</text>
  <text start="1305.72" dur="5.19">you don&amp;#39;t think that your child should</text>

  <text start="1330.889" dur="4.23">that that was weird right that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1332.989" dur="3.99">problem so if you don&amp;#39;t believe in these</text>

  <text start="1353.69" dur="4.889">scramble to get the hammer to force</text>

  <text start="1358.579" dur="3.361">you can&amp;#39;t this is actually why we had</text>
  <text start="1360.619" dur="3.51">separation of church and state in the</text>
  <text start="1361.94" dur="3.929">USA by the way because different but</text>

  <text start="1365.869" dur="4.8">force it down each other&amp;#39;s throats like</text>
  <text start="1367.519" dur="5.79">Catholics and like and Protestants and</text>
  <text start="1370.669" dur="4.14">and Mormons and I don&amp;#39;t know the exact</text>
  <text start="1373.309" dur="2.94">details it&amp;#39;s a very interesting history</text>
  <text start="1374.809" dur="3.75">to go into I don&amp;#39;t remember which groups</text>
  <text start="1376.249" dur="4.53">were fighting but that&amp;#39;s what happens</text>
  <text start="1378.559" dur="3.96">when you have a hammer everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="1380.779" dur="4.02">use the hammer because what it and what</text>
  <text start="1382.519" dur="3.63">is a hammer see when it looks out into</text>
  <text start="1384.799" dur="5.01">the world everything looks like a nail</text>
  <text start="1386.149" dur="5.88">so that is government so continuing on</text>
  <text start="1389.809" dur="3.69">kind of a quick digression into some of</text>
  <text start="1392.029" dur="4.47">the philosophy and such behind</text>
