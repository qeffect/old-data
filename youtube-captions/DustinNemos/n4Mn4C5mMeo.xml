  <text start="46.68" dur="3.99">you shouldn&amp;#39;t either</text>
  <text start="47.399" dur="5.611">you need to she used to say the words</text>

  <text start="56.55" dur="7.92">the first Thanksgiving the first years</text>
  <text start="59.28" dur="7.409">the Pilgrims landed they they had a</text>
  <text start="64.47" dur="4.62">really terrible time the vast majority</text>
  <text start="66.689" dur="5.211">of them died and she goes you want to</text>
  <text start="69.09" dur="6.72">know why because they set up a system</text>
  <text start="71.9" dur="5.98">which was a system and she used to teach</text>
  <text start="75.81" dur="5.309">me about it in a very very young age</text>
  <text start="77.88" dur="5.19">about systems and she said they they had</text>
  <text start="81.119" dur="5.61">a system that was called socialism</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="5.1">mmm-hmm where where everybody kind of</text>
  <text start="86.729" dur="2.761">put everything into one thing and then</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="4.01">you could take out as much as you want</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="7.26">and she goes in because of that system</text>
  <text start="92.18" dur="10.54">many people died she goes but it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="7.5">until the head of the colony no I I</text>
  <text start="102.72" dur="3.689">think it was William Bradford I think</text>
  <text start="104.25" dur="4.799">this is he decided hey wait a minute</text>
  <text start="106.409" dur="5.1">wait a minute we got a problem here she</text>
  <text start="109.049" dur="5.941">said they changed it so that he gave</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="5.581">people their own land and said you</text>
  <text start="114.99" dur="3.93">produce what you want and then you could</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="4.41">trade with other people or sell to other</text>
  <text start="118.92" dur="6.18">people and you can keep what you produce</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="7.7">and and you can sell what would and she</text>
  <text start="125.1" dur="8.01">goes and Dave that&amp;#39;s called capitalism</text>
  <text start="129.2" dur="4.45">and she goes in and essentially a free</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="4.079">market</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="6.36">when that happened Dave that&amp;#39;s when the</text>
  <text start="137.189" dur="8.011">real Thanksgiving happened that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="140.01" dur="6.869">people flourished people people you know</text>
  <text start="145.2" dur="4.25">it&amp;#39;s really interesting Dustin so and</text>
  <text start="146.879" dur="7.56">that was when I was like in first grade</text>
  <text start="149.45" dur="8.44">but that lesson of Thanksgiving is that</text>
  <text start="154.439" dur="6.36">passed on people are so obsessed with</text>
  <text start="157.89" dur="4.86">the the the motivations you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="160.799" dur="4.83">just a greedy capitalist rather than the</text>
  <text start="162.75" dur="4.29">results of everyone does a lot better in</text>
  <text start="165.629" dur="3.541">a capitalist system there&amp;#39;s more freedom</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="3.72">much more prosperity more efficient</text>
  <text start="169.17" dur="3.62">means of production more efficient</text>
  <text start="170.76" dur="4.05">distribution of goods and resources</text>
  <text start="172.79" dur="3.819">better for the environment better for</text>
  <text start="174.81" dur="4.23">the people better for you know the</text>
  <text start="176.609" dur="4.38">rising tide lifts all boats they get so</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="3.36">bogged down on the intentions oh you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="180.989" dur="5.071">a bad person because you want to keep</text>
  <text start="182.4" dur="5.58">your own stops no so so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.06" dur="4.2">absolutely correct and and what and what</text>
  <text start="187.98" dur="5.539">the globalists have done and what the</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="7.52">deep state has done is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="193.519" dur="8.041">transformed free-market capitalism into</text>
  <text start="197.78" dur="6.549">crony capitalism and tried to tar</text>
  <text start="201.56" dur="6.1">free-market capitalism with the crony</text>
  <text start="204.329" dur="5.511">capitalism brush mm-hmm it hasn&amp;#39;t worked</text>
  <text start="207.66" dur="5.969">very well with maginot and it has worked</text>
  <text start="209.84" dur="6.549">unfortunately it has worked exceedingly</text>
  <text start="213.629" dur="6.51">well and then when you have these people</text>
  <text start="216.389" dur="6.541">in power that put on the sheep&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.139" dur="6.66">clothing of being conservatives and free</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="6.989">marketers like Paul Ryan when in fact</text>
  <text start="226.799" dur="5.791">they are nothing but when you strip the</text>
  <text start="229.919" dur="6.301">sheep clothing away and they&amp;#39;re wolves</text>
  <text start="232.59" dur="8.579">and are truly globalist mm-hmm that are</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="7.919">trying to if you will change the</text>
  <text start="241.169" dur="8.79">narrative so that we look at capitalism</text>
  <text start="244.139" dur="9.81">as you say with in a manner that I</text>
  <text start="249.959" dur="8.911">believe is not an accurate assessment so</text>
  <text start="253.949" dur="9.84">you know again we comes back to it comes</text>
  <text start="258.87" dur="7.919">back to taking the time as I said like</text>
  <text start="263.789" dur="3.541">my my mom did because I go back to that</text>
  <text start="266.789" dur="3.87">Congress</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="4.769">many decades ago whenever I thinking</text>
  <text start="270.659" dur="4.141">Thanksgiving I think of that</text>
  <text start="272.099" dur="6.66">conversation I had with her as a first</text>
  <text start="274.8" dur="7.049">grader and that&amp;#39;s why I believe this</text>
  <text start="278.759" dur="5.041">time of year many people say I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="281.849" dur="4.951">talk about what&amp;#39;s happening around the</text>
  <text start="283.8" dur="7.049">world and my family event because I know</text>
  <text start="286.8" dur="9.6">they&amp;#39;re gonna get all upset no maybe</text>
  <text start="290.849" dur="8.07">maybe maybe not maybe not and maybe just</text>
  <text start="296.4" dur="6.269">that little story about what</text>
  <text start="298.919" dur="5.791">Thanksgiving is really about the real</text>
  <text start="302.669" dur="7.581">meaning of Thanksgiving and what really</text>
  <text start="304.71" dur="9.179">happened in the in 1621 to 1624 in</text>
  <text start="310.25" dur="7.15">Plymouth Massachusetts and why there was</text>
  <text start="313.889" dur="5.911">such utter devastation the first couple</text>
  <text start="317.4" dur="5.19">years and then why after those first</text>
  <text start="319.8" dur="8.339">couple years there was such prosperity</text>
  <text start="322.59" dur="11.129">and since and life you know that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="328.139" dur="8.721">story that that I believe should be told</text>
  <text start="333.719" dur="8.281">at every Thanksgiving table every year</text>
  <text start="336.86" dur="7.119">mm-hmm and and the only way we can do</text>
  <text start="342" dur="5.99">that and and many people are afraid to</text>
  <text start="343.979" dur="6.481">say anything and and they can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="347.99" dur="4.84">because that&amp;#39;s the first step I believe</text>
  <text start="350.46" dur="6.06">of gaining our freedoms and liberties</text>
  <text start="352.83" dur="5.51">Ben you have to speak out you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="5.459">to go fight in a trench war for freedom</text>
  <text start="358.34" dur="6.22">no no you don&amp;#39;t but you have to speak</text>
  <text start="361.979" dur="6.5">out because to just to let things simmer</text>
  <text start="364.56" dur="7.02">and poke along is doing a disservice to</text>
  <text start="368.479" dur="8.291">yourself and to your family in to our</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="8.369">country mm-hmm I agree and if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="376.77" dur="4.679">then evil wins and the default nature of</text>
  <text start="379.949" dur="4.59">humans is to go with the path of least</text>
  <text start="381.449" dur="4.141">resistance that the elite cabal whatever</text>
  <text start="384.539" dur="3.271">you want to call them they understand</text>
  <text start="385.59" dur="3.66">this they use incrementalism to take</text>
  <text start="387.81" dur="4.05">your rights to take your freedoms to</text>
  <text start="389.25" dur="5.069">take your property to enslave you and</text>
  <text start="391.86" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s very convenient and in fact people</text>
  <text start="394.319" dur="3.541">usually tend to want it because they</text>
  <text start="396.36" dur="4.049">make it so convenient and they give you</text>
  <text start="397.86" dur="3.22">all the perks of being a well-kept</text>
  <text start="400.409" dur="5.081">person</text>
  <text start="401.08" dur="6.299">rather than a free person this adversity</text>
  <text start="405.49" dur="4.649">freedom is difficult in some cases</text>
  <text start="407.379" dur="4.651">freedom in a good starting point on that</text>
  <text start="410.139" dur="3.361">conversation over the holidays is what</text>
  <text start="412.03" dur="3">we just went through with the voting</text>
  <text start="413.5" dur="3.599">process because it comes down to that</text>
  <text start="415.03" dur="5.43">statement right it&amp;#39;s not who votes but</text>
  <text start="417.099" dur="7.53">who counts the votes yeah yeah and who</text>
  <text start="420.46" dur="5.519">watches the Watchers so um that was</text>
  <text start="424.629" dur="2.97">great I&amp;#39;m actually I probably take a</text>
  <text start="425.979" dur="2.91">little snippet about for from with your</text>
