  <text start="120.95" dur="5.76">a second chance at love and life zach is</text>
  <text start="124.37" dur="4.47">not defined by the trials in his past he</text>
  <text start="126.71" dur="4.26">uses that past as fuel to make a better</text>
  <text start="128.84" dur="4.14">future for many and he was chosen to</text>

  <text start="147.8" dur="4.2">program recently Zach was invited to the</text>
  <text start="150.53" dur="3.39">White House and met the President of the</text>
  <text start="152" dur="4.019">United States and many politicians from</text>
  <text start="153.92" dur="4.14">both the left and right who recognized</text>
  <text start="156.019" dur="4.981">his bipartisan work in criminal justice</text>
  <text start="158.06" dur="4.98">reform Zach has used his second chance</text>
  <text start="161" dur="4.41">to give others their own second chance</text>
  <text start="163.04" dur="2.7">he is one of the few people I know</text>
  <text start="165.41" dur="2.1">who</text>
  <text start="165.74" dur="4.77">succeeding in making the country a</text>
  <text start="167.51" dur="5.85">better place you&amp;#39;re out there trying to</text>
  <text start="170.51" dur="5.4">do good things in the world and helping</text>
  <text start="173.36" dur="4.05">not only a dog but the people that want</text>
  <text start="175.91" dur="3.27">to reward people they&amp;#39;ve been in prison</text>
  <text start="177.41" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;ve also been invited to the White</text>
  <text start="179.18" dur="3.9">House and at the present I know you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="181.01" dur="4.22">gotten some comments and feedback on</text>
  <text start="183.08" dur="5.82">that it&amp;#39;s been very frustrating because</text>
  <text start="185.23" dur="7.36">we are passionate about second chances</text>
  <text start="188.9" dur="7.08">I&amp;#39;m a second chance receiver and now I</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="6.96">get to give second chances to two dogs</text>
  <text start="195.98" dur="5.7">and two inmates two dogs that deserve it</text>
  <text start="199.55" dur="4.26">two people that deserve it and so we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="201.68" dur="4.68">built this program positive change that</text>
  <text start="203.81" dur="4.26">we have in a handful of prisons here in</text>
  <text start="206.36" dur="5.16">California and not a juvenile facility</text>
  <text start="208.07" dur="4.59">and our goal is to give the two and a</text>
  <text start="211.52" dur="3.3">half million people that are</text>
  <text start="212.66" dur="6.84">incarcerated in America access to that</text>
  <text start="214.82" dur="7.38">program access to the reciprocal love to</text>
  <text start="219.5" dur="5.01">the to the vocational aspect of the</text>
  <text start="222.2" dur="3.63">program all the different aspects of the</text>
  <text start="224.51" dur="4.86">program which are almost too many</text>
  <text start="225.83" dur="5.91">dimension to to not just help their time</text>
  <text start="229.37" dur="4.74">be productive but to help truly</text>
  <text start="231.74" dur="4.61">rehabilitate them I don&amp;#39;t believe prison</text>
  <text start="234.11" dur="5.25">rehabilitates people it&amp;#39;s more like</text>
  <text start="236.35" dur="4.63">criminal University they&amp;#39;re treated like</text>
  <text start="239.36" dur="4.04">animals and they come out like animals</text>
  <text start="240.98" dur="5.19">and we want to put as change to that so</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="4.45">we&amp;#39;ve been petitioning Washington to get</text>
  <text start="246.17" dur="2.88">support for our program and that&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="247.85" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t care what your political</text>
  <text start="249.05" dur="6.93">affiliation is so it was very bizarre to</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="5.46">me because we met with two Democratic</text>
  <text start="255.98" dur="3.629">presidential candidates in Eric swallow</text>
  <text start="258.14" dur="4.44">and Cory Booker</text>
  <text start="259.609" dur="5.101">we met with Ayanna Presley who&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="262.58" dur="27.12">far left ill on Omar was very far left</text>
  <text start="264.71" dur="28.02">Kostya Ortez he&amp;#39;s very far left and then</text>
  <text start="289.7" dur="5.37">a bunch of other representatives who</text>
  <text start="292.73" dur="4.86">were Democrats as well as a bunch of</text>
  <text start="295.07" dur="4.5">Republicans and we really had to cast</text>
  <text start="297.59" dur="4.92">our line out to anybody who we think can</text>
  <text start="299.57" dur="7.29">help us push the program so to have so</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="6.15">much negative blowback whenever we</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="5.22">mention anything regarding the president</text>
  <text start="308.66" dur="6.24">is it&amp;#39;s kind of you know I would like to</text>
  <text start="312.08" dur="4.05">say I&amp;#39;m surprised but I&amp;#39;m not in this</text>
  <text start="314.9" dur="3.66">climate I kind of knew it was gonna</text>
  <text start="316.13" dur="4.41">happen but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s incredibly</text>
  <text start="318.56" dur="3.84">discouraging and it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="320.54" dur="4.47">wrong you know people miss the forest</text>
  <text start="322.4" dur="4.65">for the trees they have this wrong they</text>
  <text start="325.01" dur="3.45">see you know they&amp;#39;ll write comments like</text>
  <text start="327.05" dur="4.619">you lie down with dogs you&amp;#39;ll end up</text>
  <text start="328.46" dur="5.37">with fleas I can&amp;#39;t believe you support</text>
  <text start="331.669" dur="4.411">this president in what he&amp;#39;s doing don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="333.83" dur="6.27">you understand he&amp;#39;s locking up children</text>
  <text start="336.08" dur="6.42">and speaking to the president about the</text>
  <text start="340.1" dur="5.43">merits of our program has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="342.5" dur="6.6">with supporting the President on all of</text>
  <text start="345.53" dur="6.09">his policies and agendas but you know at</text>
  <text start="349.1" dur="3.72">the same time the first-step Act which</text>
  <text start="351.62" dur="3.75">is what the president pushed through</text>
  <text start="352.82" dur="4.38">like you said is a bipartisan act the</text>
  <text start="355.37" dur="3.66">first type of criminal justice reform in</text>
  <text start="357.2" dur="3.69">decades nothing has been done many</text>
  <text start="359.03" dur="3.9">things were promised us during the Obama</text>
  <text start="360.89" dur="4.17">administration nothing came through</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="4.62">finally some come through literally</text>
  <text start="365.06" dur="5.9">might be the only thing we agree on as a</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="5.78">as a people right it was like dogs and</text>
  <text start="370.96" dur="4.92">and criminal justice reform and here</text>
  <text start="373.33" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re pushing animal welfare animal</text>
  <text start="375.88" dur="4.92">rescue and criminal justice reform was</text>
  <text start="378.46" dur="5.459">everyone&amp;#39;s for but simply because the</text>
  <text start="380.8" dur="12.44">president is pictured you know or his</text>
  <text start="383.919" dur="12.421">family members or his family members</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="4.84">people want to take out all of their</text>
  <text start="396.34" dur="4.049">political frustration on our</text>
  <text start="398.08" dur="5.1">organization I mean I must have had I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="400.389" dur="4.351">not kidding a hundred people reach out</text>
  <text start="403.18" dur="3.69">and say I&amp;#39;m no longer supporting your</text>
  <text start="404.74" dur="4.92">organization I can&amp;#39;t believe you would</text>
  <text start="406.87" dur="5.359">meet the bat man and really what we had</text>
  <text start="409.66" dur="4.979">was an incredible opportunity to get our</text>
  <text start="412.229" dur="5.651">program in front of people who have the</text>
  <text start="414.639" dur="5.071">ability to to make it happen why would I</text>
  <text start="417.88" dur="4.17">not do that one of the things that</text>
  <text start="419.71" dur="4.92">frustrated me the worst is Laura Trump</text>
  <text start="422.05" dur="4.32">who is the daughter-in-law of the</text>
  <text start="424.63" dur="4.05">president and Laura&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s an</text>

  <text start="828.06" dur="4.02">actual progress being made from making</text>
  <text start="830.49" dur="4.11">that meeting did you feel there was some</text>
  <text start="832.08" dur="4.92">initiatives being considered yeah I did</text>
  <text start="834.6" dur="3.57">it was a to be honest it was really</text>
  <text start="837" dur="3.3">great to hear the president United</text>
  <text start="838.17" dur="4.2">States talk about so many things that I</text>
  <text start="840.3" dur="3.57">am passionate about you know we returned</text>

  <text start="843.87" dur="3.81">scratch and claw at things that were</text>
  <text start="846.24" dur="2.91">passionate for it doesn&amp;#39;t feel like</text>
  <text start="847.68" dur="3.3">anyone else cares about what we care</text>
  <text start="849.15" dur="3.87">about so when when you&amp;#39;re knee deep or</text>
  <text start="850.98" dur="3.72">neck deep in the struggle sometimes it</text>
  <text start="853.02" dur="3.45">can feel like man is anyone paying</text>
  <text start="854.7" dur="4.14">attention why can&amp;#39;t we get the support</text>
  <text start="856.47" dur="3.96">we need this is a valiant valuable</text>
  <text start="858.84" dur="4.08">righteous cause why can&amp;#39;t we get the</text>
  <text start="860.43" dur="4.02">attention so to get the attention and to</text>
  <text start="862.92" dur="3.42">get the attention at the highest level</text>
  <text start="864.45" dur="3.42">for to show that the President of the</text>
  <text start="866.34" dur="4.17">United States cares about the same</text>
  <text start="867.87" dur="4.92">things our program is addressing that</text>
  <text start="870.51" dur="3.66">was a huge validation and then to hear</text>
  <text start="872.79" dur="3.33">that he had mastery of what he was</text>
  <text start="874.17" dur="3.21">talking about and he was gutsy that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="876.12" dur="3.27">what I like about this president he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="877.38" dur="5.13">got he&amp;#39;s gutsy he came right out and</text>
  <text start="879.39" dur="4.92">said we want to bring unemployment level</text>
  <text start="882.51" dur="3.84">down to single digits</text>
  <text start="884.31" dur="4.05">for returning citizens for people who</text>
  <text start="886.35" dur="4.32">have served time in prison and right now</text>
  <text start="888.36" dur="4.849">the unemployment rate for people who</text>
  <text start="890.67" dur="5.19">sometimes people have felony records is</text>
  <text start="893.209" dur="3.761">is you know something like ten times the</text>
  <text start="895.86" dur="3.479">national average</text>
  <text start="896.97" dur="3.719">so it&amp;#39;s abysmal so for him to say that</text>
  <text start="899.339" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re gonna get into single digits</text>
  <text start="900.689" dur="4.71">within I think he&amp;#39;s at five years is so</text>
  <text start="903.029" dur="3.78">gutsy it&amp;#39;s my experience that he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="905.399" dur="2.94">say things unless he&amp;#39;s willing to try</text>
  <text start="906.809" dur="3.21">and follow through the best he can to</text>
  <text start="908.339" dur="3.36">make it happen so that&amp;#39;s why it was so</text>

  <text start="928.589" dur="4.98">see issues that they really have gravity</text>
  <text start="931.319" dur="4.95">that involve people&amp;#39;s lives man I mean</text>
