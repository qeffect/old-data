  <text start="129.369" dur="5.681">36:47 the Paris agreement on climate</text>
  <text start="133.03" dur="4.42">let&amp;#39;s talk about the Paris climate</text>
  <text start="135.05" dur="4.89">Accord we have a picture here of the</text>
  <text start="137.45" dur="4.8">Eiffel Tower setting the stage an</text>
  <text start="139.94" dur="4.95">article from Reuters I actually saw this</text>
  <text start="142.25" dur="4.74">one earlier but Nancy Pelosi talking</text>
  <text start="144.89" dur="3.9">about the climate change and and at the</text>

  <text start="148.79" dur="4.44">she&amp;#39;s over there taking a break from</text>
  <text start="149.9" dur="5.4">impeachment to not do her job now of</text>
  <text start="153.23" dur="3.75">course before we even dig into the rest</text>
  <text start="155.3" dur="4.11">of this I want to mention a little</text>
  <text start="156.98" dur="4.32">context global warming pretty much</text>
  <text start="159.41" dur="4.2">widely debunked at this point the idea</text>
  <text start="161.3" dur="4.53">that man-made or anthropomorphic genic a</text>
  <text start="163.61" dur="4.29">little mouthful global warming is</text>
  <text start="165.83" dur="4.23">somehow a threat to the world has been</text>
  <text start="167.9" dur="4.2">largely displaced there&amp;#39;s no real</text>
  <text start="170.06" dur="4.68">scientific consensus that was a lie an</text>
  <text start="172.1" dur="4.17">outright lie of all of the scientists or</text>
  <text start="174.74" dur="4.65">anything like that it&amp;#39;s actually more of</text>
  <text start="176.27" dur="4.64">a cult of pseudo-scientific fringe</text>
  <text start="179.39" dur="4.44">people that are that are trying to</text>
  <text start="180.91" dur="4.21">create alarmism climate alarmism and of</text>
  <text start="183.83" dur="3.21">course they&amp;#39;ve changed the name from</text>
  <text start="185.12" dur="3.24">global cooling to the global warming to</text>
  <text start="187.04" dur="3.81">not climate change after they were</text>
  <text start="188.36" dur="4.71">caught faking the emails through the and</text>
  <text start="190.85" dur="3.389">the the data through the CD not CDC</text>
  <text start="193.07" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s what vaccines through the</text>
  <text start="194.239" dur="6.301">Climategate situation whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="197.48" dur="7.07">everywhere up with them all right</text>
  <text start="200.54" dur="4.01">and there&amp;#39;s that silly noise again</text>
  <text start="209.91" dur="7.47">I don&amp;#39;t get it that noise is really</text>
  <text start="213.81" dur="6.18">annoying it&amp;#39;s messing up my whole my</text>
  <text start="217.38" dur="5.76">whole thing tonight anyway so that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="219.99" dur="4.8">little context the Sun causes most of</text>
  <text start="223.14" dur="3.24">the global warming and the global</text>
  <text start="224.79" dur="5.64">cooling and the cycles back and forth</text>
  <text start="226.38" dur="6.33">which is a naturally occurred guys I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="230.43" dur="4.53">not gonna lie I&amp;#39;m crippling through I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="232.71" dur="4.32">walking crippled through this this video</text>
  <text start="234.96" dur="3.9">because the audio issues I&amp;#39;m gonna have</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="4.26">to stop and start every two minutes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.86" dur="4.05">giving me this this feedback noise in my</text>
  <text start="241.29" dur="3.63">ear and I&amp;#39;ve spent the last hour and a</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="3.51">half trying to figure it out so I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="244.92" dur="3.39">gonna get the video out and hopefully</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="4.94">you guys will forgive me for being</text>
  <text start="248.31" dur="5.76">incompetent with my technology here now</text>
  <text start="251.36" dur="4.689">continuing on I basically was just kind</text>
  <text start="254.07" dur="5.07">of rounding out the idea that that the</text>
  <text start="256.049" dur="5.581">Sun causes most of the cyclical climate</text>
  <text start="259.14" dur="5.61">change which is naturally occurring not</text>
  <text start="261.63" dur="5.28">humans therefore ergo the the problem</text>
  <text start="264.75" dur="3.99">that they want to solve which is end of</text>
  <text start="266.91" dur="4.47">the world because if manmade climate</text>
  <text start="268.74" dur="5.13">change the solutions that they provide</text>
  <text start="271.38" dur="5.25">like starving the third world and ending</text>
  <text start="273.87" dur="5.76">our reliance on pretty much all modern</text>
  <text start="276.63" dur="4.8">electricity and and resources climate</text>
  <text start="279.63" dur="3.24">you know fossil fuels all that stuff</text>
  <text start="281.43" dur="4.65">which gives us the quality of life we</text>
  <text start="282.87" dur="5.07">have sending us back to like the 1700 s</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="4.62">while they of course by running Jets and</text>
  <text start="287.94" dur="5.58">live multi-billionaire lives it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="290.7" dur="5.16">an ultimate kind of surf and an ruler</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="4.08">move while at the same time enriching</text>
  <text start="295.86" dur="4.11">the politicians giving them absolute</text>
  <text start="297.6" dur="4.05">control absolute control over the</text>
  <text start="299.97" dur="3.87">economy picking the winners and losers</text>
  <text start="301.65" dur="3.51">in business and like I said starving to</text>
  <text start="303.84" dur="3.6">death most of the third world which</text>
  <text start="305.16" dur="5.94">wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me because another UN</text>
  <text start="307.44" dur="6.45">agenda is agenda 2030 or or 2020 as it</text>
  <text start="311.1" dur="6.12">was before now um listen so continuing</text>
  <text start="313.89" dur="6.57">on we have let&amp;#39;s see how much does it</text>
  <text start="317.22" dur="4.83">cost to steal over for or how much does</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="5.1">a Paris treatment cost over four</text>
  <text start="322.05" dur="4.2">trillion dollars how to steal taxpayer</text>
  <text start="325.56" dur="4.86">money</text>
  <text start="326.25" dur="6.87">well that con is determine topics that</text>
  <text start="330.42" dur="5.64">have emotional pull connect-the-dots</text>
  <text start="333.12" dur="5.609">on vocal types or connect on vocal types</text>
  <text start="336.06" dur="5.04">so you connect to the vocal types of</text>
  <text start="338.729" dur="4.4">people that would be very emotional</text>
  <text start="341.1" dur="4.369">about these issues and very</text>
  <text start="343.129" dur="5.1">spoken about these issues you you get</text>
  <text start="345.469" dur="4.74">them riled up and you recruit them then</text>
  <text start="348.229" dur="6.601">you create a media blitz a scare</text>
  <text start="350.209" dur="7.77">campaign talking points alarmist you use</text>
  <text start="354.83" dur="6.059">media narrative minded or I&amp;#39;m sorry Pro</text>
  <text start="357.979" dur="6.06">narrative minded authorities on subjects</text>
  <text start="360.889" dur="5.93">to provide foundation to support now in</text>
  <text start="364.039" dur="5.46">that case that means you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="366.819" dur="4.45">government officials even or or</text>
  <text start="369.499" dur="3.99">scientists that support your political</text>
  <text start="371.269" dur="5.82">agenda or maybe are getting kickbacks or</text>
  <text start="373.489" dur="6.51">something and their favorable to you and</text>
  <text start="377.089" dur="5.16">then you try to drum up support on that</text>
  <text start="379.999" dur="3.39">by saying we have all these experts we</text>
  <text start="382.249" dur="2.611">all these scientists we have all these</text>
  <text start="383.389" dur="3.84">authority figures we have all of these</text>
  <text start="384.86" dur="4.979">people that you should trust and then he</text>
  <text start="387.229" dur="5.34">says deploy circular reporting and</text>
  <text start="389.839" dur="5.31">groupthink tactics which is the echo</text>
  <text start="392.569" dur="5.36">chamber to artificially raise public</text>
  <text start="395.149" dur="5.43">outcry so of course they they report it</text>
  <text start="397.929" dur="5.05">everywhere from all of the fake news and</text>
  <text start="400.579" dur="5.12">then they ban everyone that speaks out</text>
  <text start="402.979" dur="5.1">against it of course tells the truth and</text>
  <text start="405.699" dur="4.27">then they try to assume that everyone</text>
  <text start="408.079" dur="4.59">has it they they actually were able to</text>
  <text start="409.969" dur="6.09">pass lies on the public they talk about</text>
  <text start="412.669" dur="5.28">Hitler&amp;#39;s big lie theory I mean the left</text>
  <text start="416.059" dur="6.69">actually managed to convince people that</text>
  <text start="417.949" dur="5.52">there was a scientific concern I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="422.749" dur="2.52">know why it&amp;#39;s doing that</text>
  <text start="423.469" dur="3.3">anyway the left managed to convince</text>
  <text start="425.269" dur="4.29">people that there was a scientific</text>
  <text start="426.769" dur="5.49">consensus around global warming which is</text>
  <text start="429.559" dur="6.42">nonsense by the way doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="432.259" dur="5.72">sense whatsoever and then there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="435.979" dur="5.43">proof to it there&amp;#39;s no climate change</text>
  <text start="437.979" dur="6.7">consensus among any scientists much less</text>
  <text start="441.409" dur="6.78">climate scientists in fact there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="444.679" dur="5.88">there&amp;#39;s many forming a consensus against</text>
  <text start="448.189" dur="5.58">that that lie in that deception and</text>
  <text start="450.559" dur="5.58">climate change so continuing on he says</text>
  <text start="453.769" dur="5.7">use public outcry to justify</text>
  <text start="456.139" dur="7.01">billion-dollar taxpayer spend rents and</text>
  <text start="459.469" dur="7.59">repeat who audits where the money goes</text>
  <text start="463.149" dur="6.97">percentage to original mandate salary of</text>
  <text start="467.059" dur="6.301">a US Senator salary of a US congressman</text>
  <text start="470.119" dur="6.461">or woman salary of a u.s. president</text>
  <text start="473.36" dur="5.17">salary of a US vice president</text>
  <text start="476.58" dur="3.39">and I think we know which ones we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.53" dur="3.96">talking about now president vice</text>
  <text start="479.97" dur="6.48">president this goes not just to Obama</text>
  <text start="482.49" dur="7.89">and Biden but others net worth pre</text>
  <text start="486.45" dur="7.31">office net worth post office now of</text>
  <text start="490.38" dur="6.33">course comparing these people going in</text>
  <text start="493.76" dur="4.36">basically poor compared to maybe not</text>
  <text start="496.71" dur="2.76">compared to everyone else but compared</text>
  <text start="498.12" dur="3.78">to what they are when they come out you</text>
  <text start="499.47" dur="4.77">know they go in with maybe a net worth</text>
  <text start="501.9" dur="3.6">in the millions or not even that maybe</text>
  <text start="504.24" dur="3.06">one hundred thousand two hundred</text>
  <text start="505.5" dur="3.48">thousand maybe they&amp;#39;ve just they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="507.3" dur="3.51">regular old middle-class and then they</text>
  <text start="508.98" dur="2.78">get tens of millions of dollars how does</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="4.08">that happen</text>
  <text start="511.76" dur="5.14">who audits them no one now how do</text>
  <text start="514.89" dur="4.05">elected officials become mega</text>
  <text start="516.9" dur="2.7">multimillionaires that&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="518.94" dur="4.98">question</text>
  <text start="519.6" dur="7.23">Q says corruption logical thinking so</text>
  <text start="523.92" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;m a big fan of logical thinking and it</text>
  <text start="526.83" dur="3.69">looks like there&amp;#39;s one other Q post to</text>
  <text start="529.17" dur="4.8">the night</text>
  <text start="530.52" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s just says happy holidays and let me</text>

  <text start="540.75" dur="7.14">happy holidays and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just looks</text>
  <text start="545.49" dur="4.5">like Gavin Newsom and a Nancy Pelosi</text>
  <text start="547.89" dur="3.57">over in California burning everything</text>
  <text start="549.99" dur="3.42">down so that they can get government</text>
  <text start="551.46" dur="4.02">money from it how much of that money</text>
  <text start="553.41" dur="4.74">goes to their pockets as they burn down</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="5.34">California you know that we&amp;#39;ve had so</text>
  <text start="558.15" dur="4.86">many incidents of mysterious fires being</text>
  <text start="560.82" dur="5.19">started of course the the path that</text>
  <text start="563.01" dur="4.44">those fires take the it&amp;#39;s almost as</text>
  <text start="566.01" dur="3.75">though these things were being</text>
  <text start="567.45" dur="4.14">intentionally started in California so</text>
  <text start="569.76" dur="3.87">that they could collect government money</text>
  <text start="571.59" dur="4.08">and handouts and of course emergency aid</text>
  <text start="573.63" dur="5.34">money and such because health</text>
  <text start="575.67" dur="4.59">California&amp;#39;s bankrupt now people were</text>
  <text start="578.97" dur="3.42">always shocked when I tell them that</text>
  <text start="580.26" dur="3.9">because yeah they have a big economy and</text>
  <text start="582.39" dur="3.66">such but so much corruption has</text>
  <text start="584.16" dur="4.95">bankrupted it they&amp;#39;re in one of the</text>
  <text start="586.05" dur="6.72">worst economic situations of any state</text>
  <text start="589.11" dur="5.46">and maybe the worst state out there if</text>
  <text start="592.77" dur="4.32">you actually consider the whole equation</text>
  <text start="594.57" dur="4.05">so you have to think about things like a</text>
  <text start="597.09" dur="3.21">debt and then you have to think about</text>
  <text start="598.62" dur="4.02">things like fiscal responsibility and</text>
  <text start="600.3" dur="4.26">such and they have really imploded</text>
  <text start="602.64" dur="5.61">California with the leftist corruption</text>
  <text start="604.56" dur="5.37">and and government schemes more big</text>
  <text start="608.25" dur="2.31">government for everything so I think</text>
  <text start="609.93" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="610.56" dur="5.04">for now I don&amp;#39;t see any more queue post</text>
  <text start="613.41" dur="4.41">tonight and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s getting difficult</text>
