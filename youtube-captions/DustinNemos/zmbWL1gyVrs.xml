  <text start="218.2" dur="7.23">of everyone&amp;#39;s Fourth Amendment rights</text>
  <text start="220.39" dur="7.05">and they knowingly did this Denis</text>

  <text start="302.1" dur="4.36">subsequent to call me knowing about that</text>
  <text start="304.54" dur="3.48">he went in front of Congress and was</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="4.83">specifically asked if he knew of any</text>
  <text start="308.02" dur="5.34">surveillance program that was being</text>
  <text start="311.29" dur="3.66">utilized against American citizens and</text>

  <text start="327.309" dur="5.73">information they did everything in their</text>
  <text start="328.99" dur="6.299">power to shove it under the rug so that</text>
  <text start="333.039" dur="4.53">people didn&amp;#39;t know about it now here&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="395.919" dur="4.35">mistakes because they don&amp;#39;t know how to</text>
  <text start="397.509" dur="4.351">play defense because they&amp;#39;ve always the</text>
  <text start="400.269" dur="3.51">rule of law has never applied to them</text>

  <text start="584.47" dur="4.29">hammer WikiLeaks provided the additional</text>
  <text start="586.6" dur="4.68">proof of the hammer when they dropped</text>
  <text start="588.76" dur="4.62">the vault seven cache of classified CIA</text>
  <text start="591.28" dur="5.87">documents about CIA hacking programs</text>
  <text start="593.38" dur="9.27">that confirmed the existence of a hammer</text>
  <text start="597.15" dur="7.06">so so so here&amp;#39;s the deal is that they</text>
  <text start="602.65" dur="4.83">created this hammer they had been</text>
  <text start="604.21" dur="6.15">monitoring certain individuals including</text>
  <text start="607.48" dur="4.98">Trump for many many months you know they</text>
  <text start="610.36" dur="5.04">want to pin it on well you know we did</text>
  <text start="612.46" dur="4.95">it after the FISA Court issued no no no</text>
  <text start="615.4" dur="3.81">I think they do this anyway just on</text>
  <text start="617.41" dur="3.69">powerful people in general to try to get</text>
  <text start="619.21" dur="5.75">you know things they can you it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="621.1" dur="7.32">leverage yeah right really gain it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="624.96" dur="5.02">about leverage seriously yeah I think</text>
  <text start="628.42" dur="3.3">just real quick to insert something</text>
  <text start="629.98" dur="3.39">about Psychopaths here like if you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="631.72" dur="3.33">that sort of a psychopathic frame of</text>
  <text start="633.37" dur="3.66">mind like a lot of a elite you know that</text>
  <text start="635.05" dur="4.32">sort of position power attracts those</text>
  <text start="637.03" dur="4.02">people they do not think in terms of who</text>
  <text start="639.37" dur="4.08">can I trust they think in terms of who</text>
  <text start="641.05" dur="4.35">can I put a bullet into someone with so</text>
  <text start="643.45" dur="4.02">that we can have leverage on each other</text>
  <text start="645.4" dur="3.45">like the Mafia does you know and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.47" dur="2.58">where all this child trafficking and</text>
  <text start="648.85" dur="1.76">everything else that comes in but sorry</text>
  <text start="650.05" dur="2.64">go ahead</text>
  <text start="650.61" dur="3.67">well I agree with a hundred percent of</text>
  <text start="652.69" dur="3.12">what you said but let me say something</text>
  <text start="654.28" dur="4.17">about the Mafia I think they are much</text>
  <text start="655.81" dur="4.59">more much more ethical group yeah then</text>
  <text start="658.45" dur="4.53">these could this crew sure and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="660.4" dur="5.31">honest I really know I mean people go</text>
  <text start="662.98" dur="4.44">but but it&amp;#39;s true I think there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="665.71" dur="4.05">certain set of guidelines with the Mafia</text>
  <text start="667.42" dur="4.08">as you mentioned these dudes have no</text>
  <text start="669.76" dur="4.14">guidelines man the government takes a</text>
  <text start="671.5" dur="4.5">far larger cut in the Mafia would in any</text>
  <text start="673.9" dur="4.17">situation and let&amp;#39;s be honest they</text>
  <text start="676" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re far more abusive of our rights</text>
  <text start="678.07" dur="3.69">than the Mafia would be so yeah they</text>
  <text start="680.05" dur="3.15">might come around and shake you down for</text>
  <text start="681.76" dur="3.6">10 or 20% but the government&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="683.2" dur="5.31">shake you down for 60% of what you make</text>
  <text start="685.36" dur="6.3">throughout your life is not more so not</text>
  <text start="688.51" dur="5.04">more right I completely agree so this</text>
  <text start="691.66" dur="5.73">hammer system was in place for many</text>
  <text start="693.55" dur="5.82">months and and all in so with so all</text>
  <text start="697.39" dur="3.72">this talk about the fake Russian dossier</text>
  <text start="699.37" dur="4.59">which is important to talk about because</text>
  <text start="701.11" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s abuse it&amp;#39;s abuse right but the fake</text>
  <text start="703.96" dur="6.15">Russian dossier people need to realize</text>
  <text start="705.73" dur="6.3">was created to go to the FISA Court to</text>
  <text start="710.11" dur="3.69">get these surveillance grants that many</text>
  <text start="712.03" dur="2.94">people believe were illegally obtained</text>
  <text start="713.8" dur="3.62">because it was based on a fraudulent</text>
  <text start="714.97" dur="4.52">document I agree with that assessment</text>
  <text start="717.42" dur="4.83">but I understand something that was</text>
  <text start="719.49" dur="6.12">meant as a cover up for this hammer</text>
  <text start="722.25" dur="5.52">theme for this hammer thing it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="725.61" dur="4.14">similar and this is a million times</text>
  <text start="727.77" dur="5.37">worse than Watergate but with the cover</text>
  <text start="729.75" dur="5.46">up right where&amp;#39;s the diamond explains</text>
  <text start="733.14" dur="4.47">this exploit explains the sloppiness</text>
  <text start="735.21" dur="7.32">right exactly</text>
  <text start="737.61" dur="6.24">so so again many people outside that</text>
  <text start="742.53" dur="4.05">window and the People&amp;#39;s Republic of A&amp;amp;R</text>
  <text start="743.85" dur="5.37">but don&amp;#39;t even want to address the fake</text>
  <text start="746.58" dur="6.21">Russian dossier but when then you start</text>
  <text start="749.22" dur="5.61">talking about the hammer mm-hmm I mean</text>
  <text start="752.79" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s like what are you I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="754.83" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s beyond conspiracy it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="756.84" dur="3.99">another two years before people start</text>
  <text start="758.25" dur="4.35">talking about it probably everyone else</text>
  <text start="760.83" dur="3.48">using to you two years later and now</text>
  <text start="762.6" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re like oh look big breaking news</text>
  <text start="764.31" dur="3.9">for sobic and others your breaking news</text>
  <text start="766.17" dur="4.05">this and this yeah we knew about that</text>
  <text start="768.21" dur="3.09">two years ago Thanks and in the</text>
  <text start="770.22" dur="3.3">important point now one of the other</text>
  <text start="771.3" dur="4.14">important points on this Dustin is you</text>
  <text start="773.52" dur="4.14">present information to your viewership I</text>
  <text start="775.44" dur="4.59">try to do the same thing with my YouTube</text>
  <text start="777.66" dur="5.34">channel with my radio show so that our</text>
  <text start="780.03" dur="4.65">listenership that you&amp;#39;re not gonna see</text>
  <text start="783" dur="4.56">in the bought off lamestream fake media</text>
  <text start="784.68" dur="6.75">mm-hmm and and and this is really</text>
  <text start="787.56" dur="7.62">important because information honest</text>
  <text start="791.43" dur="7.11">information education on what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="795.18" dur="4.86">occurring really empowers people and</text>
  <text start="798.54" dur="3.09">this is exactly what the bought off</text>
  <text start="800.04" dur="3.39">flame stream fayek media does not want</text>
  <text start="801.63" dur="3.15">they want to keep misinformed dis inform</text>
  <text start="803.43" dur="2.91">and keep people in the dark because it</text>
  <text start="804.78" dur="4.77">makes them easier victims and it makes</text>
  <text start="806.34" dur="5.66">them less likely to ask important</text>
  <text start="809.55" dur="4.98">questions and less likely to quote</text>
  <text start="812" dur="4.27">revolt against the system you know I</text>
  <text start="814.53" dur="3.81">think a lot of those left media types</text>
  <text start="816.27" dur="4.14">could be like at least for the first few</text>
  <text start="818.34" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s sort of turnover like if they</text>
  <text start="820.41" dur="3.6">come out against their former comrades</text>
  <text start="822.06" dur="3.12">and turn honest and starting to tell</text>
  <text start="824.01" dur="3.03">things the way they really were they</text>
  <text start="825.18" dur="3.9">would be heroes to our movement they may</text>
  <text start="827.04" dur="3.09">suffer a pay cut but you know they would</text>
  <text start="829.08" dur="3.84">sleep a lot better they would have</text>
  <text start="830.13" dur="4.56">integrity they would be social heroes</text>
  <text start="832.92" dur="4.44">you know that has some value to it as</text>
  <text start="834.69" dur="4.68">well money is not everything I just</text>
  <text start="837.36" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t understand why they it&amp;#39;s that sort</text>
  <text start="839.37" dur="2.97">of communist idols they lock them in</text>
  <text start="841.11" dur="4.14">when they&amp;#39;re kids and really mess them</text>
  <text start="842.34" dur="6.11">up well and and this is from an old guy</text>
  <text start="845.25" dur="5.55">I believe the reason why they don&amp;#39;t is</text>
  <text start="848.45" dur="6.4">because information that was</text>
  <text start="850.8" dur="9.39">we obtain on down through the hammer mmm</text>
  <text start="854.85" dur="9.06">leverage sure you I am sure I am sure</text>
  <text start="860.19" dur="5.64">that all these folks makin a gazillion</text>
  <text start="863.91" dur="3.989">dollars who would not make a gazillion</text>
  <text start="865.83" dur="2.4">dollars reading teleprompters anywhere</text>
  <text start="867.899" dur="3.571">else</text>
  <text start="868.23" dur="6.63">mm-hmm I am sure if they started to go</text>
  <text start="871.47" dur="6.69">off the reservation you would start to</text>
  <text start="874.86" dur="4.74">find out stuff about their background</text>
  <text start="878.16" dur="3.9">and a lot of that background information</text>
  <text start="879.6" dur="5.549">I believe would come out would come from</text>
  <text start="882.06" dur="4.68">this hammer platform you know I would I</text>
  <text start="885.149" dur="2.971">would love to see the Ananse and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="886.74" dur="3.779">been talking about this for a while not</text>
  <text start="888.12" dur="4.14">go after CNN or whatever Ben laughs that</text>
  <text start="890.519" dur="3.63">the names that are doing the harm that</text>
  <text start="892.26" dur="3.449">the management and the people not</text>
  <text start="894.149" dur="3.331">physically of course but with their you</text>
  <text start="895.709" dur="3.63">know with their information use what we</text>
  <text start="897.48" dur="4.56">do which is discover things and look up</text>
  <text start="899.339" dur="3.781">things and and expose every single one</text>
  <text start="902.04" dur="3.03">of them for the things that they do but</text>
  <text start="903.12" dur="3.959">it&amp;#39;s kind of just a dream of mine well I</text>
  <text start="905.07" dur="4.769">would say it&amp;#39;s occurred on some point is</text>
  <text start="907.079" dur="5.221">it may have the Brian Williams the Brian</text>
  <text start="909.839" dur="4.801">Ross&amp;#39;s you know but but you&amp;#39;re right</text>
  <text start="912.3" dur="4.83">yeah because frankly as far as I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="914.64" dur="4.77">concerned we could probably go through</text>
  <text start="917.13" dur="5.19">every newsroom in the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="919.41" dur="7.32">in our country and we could probably</text>
  <text start="922.32" dur="6.48">find a way for all of them to be to be</text>
  <text start="926.73" dur="3.9">fired to be terminated division B&amp;#39;s them</text>
  <text start="928.8" dur="3.75">inter dot because we have to sort of</text>
  <text start="930.63" dur="4.41">fight back and you know they they are</text>
  <text start="932.55" dur="4.38">really immoral and and honestly shaming</text>
  <text start="935.04" dur="3.69">and authorization is the alternative to</text>
  <text start="936.93" dur="4.2">violence you know they gate they go hit</text>
  <text start="938.73" dur="4.71">and beat up and censor we just point out</text>
  <text start="941.13" dur="4.28">abuse and exploitation and let people</text>
  <text start="943.44" dur="6.03">decide whether or not they support it</text>
  <text start="945.41" dur="6.369">yeah and and again III but this is where</text>
  <text start="949.47" dur="5.4">we see a lot of people moving away from</text>
  <text start="951.779" dur="6.781">the lamestream P it&amp;#39;s taken much too</text>
  <text start="954.87" dur="6.42">long as you can attest to I can attest</text>
  <text start="958.56" dur="5.19">you but if I look at where we were a</text>
  <text start="961.29" dur="4.859">year ago with the away with awakening</text>
  <text start="963.75" dur="4.019">people where we were five years ago ten</text>
  <text start="966.149" dur="3.141">years ago when I started my radio show</text>
  <text start="967.769" dur="4.051">in October at 2010</text>
  <text start="969.29" dur="5.47">Dustin the the first thing I said when I</text>
  <text start="971.82" dur="5.22">went on-air was based on my experience</text>
  <text start="974.76" dur="3.63">in Washington our government if people</text>
  <text start="977.04" dur="3.12">think of it as having either two</text>

  <text start="980.16" dur="2.91">is called the Republic rats and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1004.139" dur="6.151">conspiracy it took a while for the</text>
  <text start="1008.249" dur="3.81">listenership to actually realize wait a</text>
  <text start="1010.29" dur="4.38">minute because things that were being</text>
  <text start="1012.059" dur="4.71">said in October 2010 started to happen</text>
  <text start="1014.67" dur="3.359">started to occur ahead and people were</text>
  <text start="1016.769" dur="3.391">saying well you know those those</text>

  <text start="1023.67" dur="5.039">awakening that I have seen at least</text>

  <text start="1463.84" dur="4.709">Hussein when that happened not so good</text>
  <text start="1465.369" dur="4.74">things and the same thing and he wanted</text>
  <text start="1468.549" dur="4.38">to go to a gold-backed an hour not just</text>

  <text start="1476.739" dur="5.37">alone and in addition it&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="1480.129" dur="4.14">understanding from these folks that were</text>
  <text start="1482.109" dur="5.01">on this commission there were donors to</text>
  <text start="1484.269" dur="6.811">the Clinton Foundation donors to Obama&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1495.129" dur="5.16">had tremendous amount of gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1496.869" dur="5.821">and sure as shootin when no pun intended</text>
  <text start="1500.289" dur="4.32">but when this weapons running operation</text>
  <text start="1502.69" dur="3.75">was full effect with Stevens funneling</text>
  <text start="1504.609" dur="4.741">the arms to al-qaeda Qaddafi gets</text>

  <text start="1518.919" dur="5.49">oil contracts go somewhere gold and</text>
  <text start="1521.289" dur="5.01">silver is now gone Stevens then was</text>
  <text start="1524.409" dur="4.08">directed to take these arms that were</text>
  <text start="1526.299" dur="4.35">funneled into al-qaeda to kill Qaddafi</text>
  <text start="1528.489" dur="3.87">and to overthrow the country to take</text>
  <text start="1530.649" dur="3.66">those arms and reverse the flow and in</text>
  <text start="1532.359" dur="5.01">fact the last person Stevens met with</text>
  <text start="1534.309" dur="4.8">was an ambassador from Turkey and the</text>
  <text start="1537.369" dur="5.04">flow was he was going to get these flow</text>
  <text start="1539.109" dur="5.7">of flow of arms funnel them into Turkey</text>
  <text start="1542.409" dur="5.931">was then funneling him into Syria to</text>

  <text start="1565.269" dur="3.78">of Flynn</text>
  <text start="1565.809" dur="6.45">because general Flynn said this is BS</text>
  <text start="1569.049" dur="4.801">this is wrong this is horrible and he</text>
  <text start="1572.259" dur="3.961">started to leak that information and</text>
  <text start="1573.85" dur="4.59">this is the way they got back in here so</text>

  <text start="2091.79" dur="4.889">employees would go yeah but it&amp;#39;s range</text>
  <text start="2094.04" dur="5.64">what happens what happens with this RI F</text>
  <text start="2096.679" dur="5.701">is that there are four categories that</text>
  <text start="2099.68" dur="5.01">every employee is reviewed so if when</text>
  <text start="2102.38" dur="4.59">the when the 30 days kicks in every head</text>

  <text start="2106.97" dur="3.74">to look at every employee that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2108.319" dur="7.431">furloughed and look at their tenure</text>
  <text start="2110.71" dur="6.69">their status as a veteran mm-hmm maybe</text>
  <text start="2115.75" dur="4.2">stack it a little bit and stagger keep</text>
  <text start="2117.4" dur="5.459">the military types right right their</text>
  <text start="2119.95" dur="6.3">length of service and their performance</text>
  <text start="2122.859" dur="6.18">reviews and they&amp;#39;re given a number okay</text>
  <text start="2126.25" dur="5.01">sorry Lena performance given a number</text>
  <text start="2129.039" dur="3.99">and then the low numbers the automatic</text>
  <text start="2131.26" dur="3.059">and gone gone gone gone and you go up</text>
  <text start="2133.029" dur="2.58">the list until you get to a point where</text>
  <text start="2134.319" dur="4.171">you go okay we&amp;#39;ve hit the number where</text>
  <text start="2135.609" dur="4.111">we&amp;#39;re okay now yeah but but and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2138.49" dur="5.51">how its implemented</text>
  <text start="2139.72" dur="7.589">hmm so what this means Dustin is that</text>
  <text start="2144" dur="4.779">potentially what this individual the</text>
  <text start="2147.309" dur="3.871">senior Trump official that pointed out</text>
  <text start="2148.779" dur="5.371">is 85% of these people are working</text>
  <text start="2151.18" dur="5.849">against the American the American the</text>
  <text start="2154.15" dur="4.379">public against the taxpayer blow gate we</text>
  <text start="2157.029" dur="3.991">only think so</text>

  <text start="2178.779" dur="3.27">was a great you know and in Germany and</text>
  <text start="2180.91" dur="2.879">the rest of them would they would take</text>
  <text start="2182.049" dur="3.78">Trump very seriously if he did this they</text>
  <text start="2183.789" dur="4.381">would take the same lesson from it right</text>
  <text start="2185.829" dur="5.191">and I think that he should absolutely do</text>
  <text start="2188.17" dur="5.429">it and so what they do by the way so no</text>

  <text start="2232.029" dur="8.701">working against the American taxpayer</text>
  <text start="2234.789" dur="9.711">and against the administration well it</text>
  <text start="2240.73" dur="5.84">could be that as this continues</text>
  <text start="2244.5" dur="3.599">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a big chunk of those</text>
  <text start="2246.57" dur="5.4">folks that always thought they were</text>

  <text start="2278.04" dur="3">what we talked of earlier right yeah I</text>
  <text start="2279.42" dur="4.77">imagine Trump is a derivate and can use</text>

  <text start="2916.32" dur="5.26">essentially to the deep state mm-hmm so</text>
  <text start="2920.56" dur="3.81">what&amp;#39;s my point</text>
  <text start="2921.58" dur="4.53">as Helen Chapman pointed out in my show</text>
  <text start="2924.37" dur="3.99">and she&amp;#39;s one of the people who took</text>
  <text start="2926.11" dur="3.87">down Bernie Madoff and one of the</text>

  <text start="2929.98" dur="4.83">she took him down was that all these</text>
  <text start="2932.86" dur="4.05">Bernie Madoff clients were getting these</text>
  <text start="2934.81" dur="4.62">really nice paper statements every month</text>
  <text start="2936.91" dur="4.8">about what stocks they owned and how</text>
  <text start="2939.43" dur="3.21">they were doing he never bought him</text>
  <text start="2941.71" dur="4.14">mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="2942.64" dur="7.53">it was all fake and what she learned was</text>
  <text start="2945.85" dur="6.96">all paper assets are worth the paper</text>
  <text start="2950.17" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re printed on essentially nothing</text>
  <text start="2952.81" dur="6.15">you know they just have it doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="2955.96" dur="5.4">you do and the point is is that the</text>
  <text start="2958.96" dur="4.2">dollar the financial system is based on</text>
  <text start="2961.36" dur="3.39">the Full Faith and Credit of the</text>
  <text start="2963.16" dur="3.69">government well wait a minute</text>
  <text start="2964.75" dur="3.54">if the government is saying for our own</text>
  <text start="2966.85" dur="3.12">accounting we&amp;#39;re not going to use</text>
  <text start="2968.29" dur="4.26">standard accounting practices anything</text>
  <text start="2969.97" dur="4.86">goes and we know that private</text>
  <text start="2972.55" dur="3.72">corporations can be winners and losers</text>
  <text start="2974.83" dur="3.84">yeah you don&amp;#39;t have to go along with</text>
  <text start="2976.27" dur="5.1">those pesky financial standards how in</text>
  <text start="2978.67" dur="5.49">the world do you have a financial system</text>
  <text start="2981.37" dur="4.65">that survives when the accounting</text>
  <text start="2984.16" dur="4.5">principles are thrown out the door for</text>
  <text start="2986.02" dur="4.68">dodges governmental entities but for</text>
  <text start="2988.66" dur="4.65">private corporations as well you get</text>
  <text start="2990.7" dur="3.93">that crony event corporate ah cracy</text>
  <text start="2993.31" dur="2.91">merger and that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;ve been for</text>
  <text start="2994.63" dur="3.51">quite a while now and they pick the</text>
  <text start="2996.22" dur="3.45">winners and losers and they pick up not</text>
  <text start="2998.14" dur="4.05">the most efficient like the free market</text>
  <text start="2999.67" dur="4.8">would so there&amp;#39;s a lot of trouble in</text>
  <text start="3002.19" dur="3.87">that whole system as well for sure and I</text>
  <text start="3004.47" dur="3.36">was going to say by the way I think the</text>
  <text start="3006.06" dur="4.68">new method is to take the paper and dip</text>
  <text start="3007.83" dur="5.85">it into a bucket of black paint so</text>
  <text start="3010.74" dur="6.84">there&amp;#39;s a lot quicker</text>
  <text start="3013.68" dur="5.85">it would be more cost-effective yeah so</text>
  <text start="3017.58" dur="3.78">um you know we would I said we talked</text>
  <text start="3019.53" dur="3.42">about the Fed we talked about the</text>
  <text start="3021.36" dur="4.68">shutdown potentially cleaning house</text>

  <text start="3056.28" dur="3.78">wanted to at this point so I think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3058.47" dur="3.12">holding off you know I&amp;#39;m very optimistic</text>
  <text start="3060.06" dur="3.24">about it I think he&amp;#39;s holding off for</text>
  <text start="3061.59" dur="3.48">optimal time to unleash it because you</text>
  <text start="3063.3" dur="3.54">got to remember just like we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="3065.07" dur="3">about with that whole Overton Window and</text>

  <text start="3069.39" dur="3.09">that trend started it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="3070.83" dur="3.75">lighthouse you know it slowly slowly</text>
  <text start="3072.48" dur="4.62">rotates but then you can talk about that</text>
  <text start="3074.58" dur="4.5">issue the deep state you know that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3077.1" dur="4.38">household term now the fake news that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="3085.47" dur="2.01">that they&amp;#39;re doing that&amp;#39;s next I think</text>
  <text start="3087.09" dur="2.88">so</text>
  <text start="3087.48" dur="4.08">you know between that him cutting the</text>
  <text start="3089.97" dur="2.85">regulations and the taxes you know</text>
  <text start="3091.56" dur="4.68">potentially eliminating all these</text>

  <text start="3100.74" dur="3.69">the election reform that&amp;#39;s also very</text>
  <text start="3102.3" dur="4.23">exciting because he has the energy to do</text>
  <text start="3104.43" dur="4.26">that after midterms now I mean he could</text>
  <text start="3106.53" dur="5.16">change this country back a hundred years</text>
  <text start="3108.69" dur="5.34">in turn I got I got the heat from a lot</text>
  <text start="3111.69" dur="4.35">of my listeners about that because my</text>
  <text start="3114.03" dur="4.11">sources had said about the midterms you</text>
  <text start="3116.04" dur="3.6">know many people were counting on oh all</text>
  <text start="3118.14" dur="2.85">these people that got elected and it</text>
  <text start="3119.64" dur="2.97">seemed to be fraudulently they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="3120.99" dur="3.87">get thrown out of office and it should</text>
  <text start="3122.61" dur="4.35">be yeah they should be I agree with it</text>
  <text start="3124.86" dur="3.99">but my sources were saying no evidence</text>
  <text start="3126.96" dur="3.63">is being accumulated and people are</text>
  <text start="3128.85" dur="3.69">being taken down behind the curtain and</text>
  <text start="3130.59" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re pushing to get higher-ups but</text>
  <text start="3132.54" dur="5.34">this is going to be used for huge</text>

  <text start="3137.88" dur="3.42">let&amp;#39;s say that the smart thing to do</text>
  <text start="3139.47" dur="3.48">would be to actually leave somebody in</text>
  <text start="3141.3" dur="3.54">office if you knew that they broke the</text>
  <text start="3142.95" dur="4.76">law and then use that leverage to</text>
  <text start="3144.84" dur="5.52">control them even if they are Democrat</text>
  <text start="3147.71" dur="4.84">right and I understand that and that</text>
  <text start="3150.36" dur="4.7">that is one way to handle it that&amp;#39;s how</text>

  <text start="3239.7" dur="5.07">calls those cards very close and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3241.44" dur="6.72">Donald J Trump yeah and I I truly</text>
  <text start="3244.77" dur="5.19">believe that he has this mapped out that</text>
  <text start="3248.16" dur="3.06">doesn&amp;#39;t mean it won&amp;#39;t change because I</text>
  <text start="3249.96" dur="4.619">think it probably has changed a couple</text>
  <text start="3251.22" dur="8.31">times but but I think he has a certain</text>
  <text start="3254.579" dur="11.401">set of dominoes that fall I think one</text>
  <text start="3259.53" dur="7.86">way for him is is is is getting bar in</text>

  <text start="3269.52" dur="5.13">confusing because I know he&amp;#39;s George HW</text>
  <text start="3271.64" dur="3.909">or Jake yeah I get it but you know I</text>
  <text start="3274.65" dur="3.06">don&amp;#39;t know if you watched his</text>

  <text start="3974.89" dur="5.82">we bring good in for me I mean positive</text>
  <text start="3978.36" dur="4.87">information to people but we also</text>
  <text start="3980.71" dur="5.159">bring them information they need to know</text>
  <text start="3983.23" dur="6.33">about that&amp;#39;s not so positive yeah and</text>
  <text start="3985.869" dur="6.451">and we would be doing a disservice if we</text>
  <text start="3989.56" dur="4.74">did not do that just as as a physician</text>
  <text start="3992.32" dur="4.38">you do a disservice to the patient and</text>
  <text start="3994.3" dur="6.39">don&amp;#39;t deliver that information that they</text>
  <text start="3996.7" dur="9.56">need to know about and I&amp;#39;d love to give</text>
  <text start="4000.69" dur="10.62">you a little personal thing a month ago</text>

  <text start="4016.1" dur="7.48">[Music]</text>
  <text start="4017.99" dur="7.71">yesterday I was given information that</text>

  <text start="4025.7" dur="4.96">and some people said well maybe you</text>
  <text start="4029.22" dur="6.36">shouldn&amp;#39;t have had some of that bad</text>
  <text start="4030.66" dur="6.81">information a month ago mm-hmm no I can</text>
  <text start="4035.58" dur="5.55">tell you it was the better way to go it</text>
  <text start="4037.47" dur="6.75">was important for me to know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="4041.13" dur="6.62">good diagnosis here and there&amp;#39;s a really</text>
  <text start="4044.22" dur="6.54">bad diagnosis here and we need to</text>
  <text start="4047.75" dur="5.859">determine and it&amp;#39;s gonna take some time</text>
  <text start="4050.76" dur="5.25">a little bit of time to figure out if</text>
  <text start="4053.609" dur="6.48">it&amp;#39;s good or bad mmm I was very</text>
  <text start="4056.01" dur="7.47">fortunate that it turned out to be a</text>
  <text start="4060.089" dur="6.75">good sign but it wouldn&amp;#39;t have been</text>
  <text start="4063.48" dur="4.44">right to tell me hey Dave everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4066.839" dur="2.52">fine we&amp;#39;re just gonna get a couple</text>
  <text start="4067.92" dur="2.79">little tests but there&amp;#39;s nothing there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4069.359" dur="3.091">nothing you need to be you can say</text>
  <text start="4070.71" dur="3.48">positive about things and not like freak</text>
  <text start="4072.45" dur="3.87">someone out but you know the truth is</text>
  <text start="4074.19" dur="3.54">the best course always and you know you</text>
  <text start="4076.32" dur="3.33">can you can ignore reality but you</text>
  <text start="4077.73" dur="4.29">cannot ignore the consequences of</text>
  <text start="4079.65" dur="3.63">ignoring reality right though you you</text>
  <text start="4082.02" dur="3.18">you know it&amp;#39;s better to take these</text>
  <text start="4083.28" dur="3.36">things head-on and and I would say that</text>
  <text start="4085.2" dur="3.72">there are still so many people that are</text>
  <text start="4086.64" dur="4.29">living in the cave like Plato&amp;#39;s cave you</text>
  <text start="4088.92" dur="3.33">know and they&amp;#39;re still watching the</text>
  <text start="4090.93" dur="3.27">shadows dance in the wall and they think</text>
  <text start="4092.25" dur="3.27">that&amp;#39;s life and then for those of us who</text>
  <text start="4094.2" dur="2.849">are out here trying to help them wake</text>
  <text start="4095.52" dur="3.21">them up you know they get angry at us</text>
  <text start="4097.049" dur="3.391">sometimes but if we can wake a few of</text>
  <text start="4098.73" dur="4.109">them up we can change people&amp;#39;s lives</text>
  <text start="4100.44" dur="4.379">forever and for the better and you know</text>
  <text start="4102.839" dur="4.861">it&amp;#39;s an opportunity we at least have to</text>
  <text start="4104.819" dur="4.861">invite people to well it goes back again</text>
  <text start="4107.7" dur="5.169">when you go in that room and you tell</text>
  <text start="4109.68" dur="5.38">somebody that</text>
  <text start="4112.869" dur="4.02">the test results have come in and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4115.06" dur="4.02">the diagnosis and it&amp;#39;s not good</text>
  <text start="4116.889" dur="3.75">there are basically two reactions I used</text>
  <text start="4119.08" dur="4.699">to get as a physician when they do that</text>
  <text start="4120.639" dur="6.06">one is people would say oh you&amp;#39;re raw</text>
  <text start="4123.779" dur="4.69">this is this is not what&amp;#39;s going on with</text>
  <text start="4126.699" dur="3.83">me I&amp;#39;m walking out of here and I&amp;#39;m never</text>
  <text start="4128.469" dur="6.451">coming back</text>
  <text start="4130.529" dur="7.241">Dustin the folks that unfortunately</text>
  <text start="4134.92" dur="4.009">would do that we&amp;#39;re dead in a box in a</text>
  <text start="4137.77" dur="5.279">year yeah</text>
  <text start="4138.929" dur="6.19">the second reaction you get is is this</text>
  <text start="4143.049" dur="5.641">isn&amp;#39;t right it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not fair it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4145.119" dur="9.801">not and then folks would look at me and</text>
  <text start="4148.69" dur="8.85">say okay doc what do we do what do we do</text>
  <text start="4154.92" dur="5.049">where do I have to go what do we what</text>
  <text start="4157.54" dur="2.94">needs to be done to give me the best</text>
  <text start="4159.969" dur="4.261">shot</text>
  <text start="4160.48" dur="8.31">sure fight Dustin those are the people</text>
  <text start="4164.23" dur="6.54">who survive absolutely and there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="4168.79" dur="4.86">of willpower connection to health for</text>
  <text start="4170.77" dur="6.5">short right so so to those people that</text>

  <text start="4184.449" dur="3.931">hand those that say you know this is</text>
  <text start="4185.859" dur="6.121">distressing and I&amp;#39;d rather not know</text>
  <text start="4188.38" dur="6.81">about this but you know what I know it</text>
  <text start="4191.98" dur="5.94">and I&amp;#39;m obligated for my children for</text>

  <text start="4208.57" dur="3.81">people who have wake up to these things</text>
  <text start="4209.889" dur="4.23">but you know you don&amp;#39;t have to bring in</text>
