  <text start="1.07" dur="5.17">well hum about my friends this is</text>
  <text start="3.36" dur="4.829">destiny most of destiny most calm and</text>
  <text start="6.24" dur="4.92">you know there&amp;#39;s not that many things</text>
  <text start="8.189" dur="4.41">that I want to cover today a couple</text>
  <text start="11.16" dur="3.83">things that were worth mentioning and</text>
  <text start="12.599" dur="5.161">also I&amp;#39;m gonna start off with a trend</text>
  <text start="14.99" dur="5.65">because there is a trend that&amp;#39;s emerging</text>
  <text start="17.76" dur="6.42">right now you know we&amp;#39;re going into</text>
  <text start="20.64" dur="6.75">midterms and the Democrats across the</text>
  <text start="24.18" dur="5.07">board probably not all of them but in</text>
  <text start="27.39" dur="4.59">many cases there have been numerous</text>
  <text start="29.25" dur="7.17">scandals you know the project Veritas</text>
  <text start="31.98" dur="6.419">videos come to mind you just we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="36.42" dur="5.819">winning we&amp;#39;re winning across the board</text>
  <text start="38.399" dur="5.881">we&amp;#39;re winning everywhere just about the</text>
  <text start="42.239" dur="4.14">trend is that they&amp;#39;re getting tons of</text>
  <text start="44.28" dur="4.23">money from some of these liberal mega</text>
  <text start="46.379" dur="4.381">donors like George Soros Tom Steyer and</text>
  <text start="48.51" dur="4.979">others but we&amp;#39;re still winning they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="50.76" dur="7.29">hitting this wall of truth this wall</text>
  <text start="53.489" dur="5.701">that is truth and they&amp;#39;re just not all</text>
  <text start="58.05" dur="2.97">the money that they&amp;#39;re bringing in</text>
  <text start="59.19" dur="3.689">although the DNC itself is doing very</text>
  <text start="61.02" dur="4.83">badly and they&amp;#39;re in a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="62.879" dur="6.231">financially nearly bankrupt and the RNC</text>
  <text start="65.85" dur="5.82">is doing very well but I just want to</text>
  <text start="69.11" dur="4.99">basically congratulate all the Magra</text>
  <text start="71.67" dur="4.26">folks out there because we are winning</text>
  <text start="74.1" dur="4.8">now don&amp;#39;t get complacent obviously don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="75.93" dur="6.329">sit home on voting day but be encouraged</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="6.99">we are winning dramatically but to that</text>
  <text start="82.259" dur="6.631">end you know it now is the time to cast</text>
  <text start="85.89" dur="4.589">as much light on these these bad</text>
  <text start="88.89" dur="3.659">candidates as possible</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="5.761">really get the word out about that stuff</text>
  <text start="92.549" dur="6.901">and on voting day you know one idea I</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="5.19">saw take your cameras you know stake out</text>
  <text start="99.45" dur="4.559">the place kind of considered a volunteer</text>
  <text start="101.43" dur="5.52">effort I mean this is important</text>
  <text start="104.009" dur="5.04">keep an eye for buses if you see a bus</text>
  <text start="106.95" dur="3.87">and they&amp;#39;re dropping off a bunch of</text>
  <text start="109.049" dur="4.741">voters follow them see if they goes to</text>
  <text start="110.82" dur="5.43">another voting area as well because the</text>
  <text start="113.79" dur="5.399">odds are that they will try and they</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="4.979">will succeed in some places unless we</text>
  <text start="119.189" dur="3.57">have a whole lot of people out there</text>
  <text start="121.229" dur="4.17">making it real obvious that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="4.351">watching you and we will report you and</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="4.17">you will be busted for voter fraud</text>
  <text start="127.11" dur="5.849">people are going to jail for that now so</text>
  <text start="129.569" dur="4.361">it&amp;#39;s great but let me get through just a</text>
  <text start="132.959" dur="6.941">few things I wanted to</text>
  <text start="133.93" dur="9.72">and one a judge is shocked after finding</text>
  <text start="139.9" dur="8.819">that Cheryl Mills was given immunity in</text>
  <text start="143.65" dur="7.709">the Clinton email case judge I think the</text>
  <text start="148.719" dur="5.071">Lamberth is the name of course we</text>
  <text start="151.359" dur="4.231">already knew this but you know even the</text>
  <text start="153.79" dur="5.309">judges themselves are like what the hell</text>
  <text start="155.59" dur="5.549">is going on here so we&amp;#39;re getting to and</text>
  <text start="159.099" dur="4.801">maybe she&amp;#39;s got immunity maybe we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="161.139" dur="4.77">get her but we are getting to some form</text>
  <text start="163.9" dur="3.929">of justice down the road these things</text>
  <text start="165.909" dur="3.36">are coming out now the things that they</text>
  <text start="167.829" dur="5.011">did to try to cover their tracks are</text>
  <text start="169.269" dur="5.791">coming out now back to the the voting</text>
  <text start="172.84" dur="4.979">thing and how we&amp;#39;re winning in just</text>
  <text start="175.06" dur="4.079">Wyoming it&amp;#39;s come out that over 12,000</text>
  <text start="177.819" dur="4.95">voters have changed their party</text>
  <text start="179.139" dur="6.3">affiliation and 90% of those were</text>
  <text start="182.769" dur="6.381">changing to Republicans so that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="185.439" dur="6.66">hashtag walkaway in effect right there</text>
  <text start="189.15" dur="6.16">and of course that&amp;#39;s just one state but</text>
  <text start="192.099" dur="5.64">imagine the trend over the multitude of</text>
  <text start="195.31" dur="4.38">states out there this is great news I</text>
  <text start="197.739" dur="4.11">mean it may not be as high as 90%</text>
  <text start="199.69" dur="5.519">elsewhere but we we can expect and we</text>
  <text start="201.849" dur="6.92">can bet that most of these states it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="205.209" dur="3.56">it&amp;#39;s swinging in our favor</text>
  <text start="209.609" dur="6.97">apparently Rosenstein is demanding a</text>
  <text start="212.26" dur="7.229">special format for his testifying on</text>
  <text start="216.579" dur="4.981">Capitol Hill basically he says I want</text>
  <text start="219.489" dur="5.49">two Democrats and two Republicans closed</text>
  <text start="221.56" dur="6.69">doors this is BS you don&amp;#39;t get to make</text>
  <text start="224.979" dur="6.061">demands on Congress show up or resign</text>
  <text start="228.25" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s basically what he needs to do and</text>
  <text start="231.04" dur="3.449">and they&amp;#39;re saying I mean Jordan is</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="3.39">saying I think it&amp;#39;s Jordan was saying</text>
  <text start="234.489" dur="6.84">you know you just need to resign at this</text>
  <text start="236.29" dur="6.27">point this is kind of worth mentioning</text>
  <text start="241.329" dur="5.31">for those who have been paying attention</text>
  <text start="242.56" dur="7.799">in the honduran hoard kind of catching</text>
  <text start="246.639" dur="6.78">their honda and horde of over 4,000 they</text>
  <text start="250.359" dur="4.5">have made it to Mexico but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="253.419" dur="4.44">letting them in so they&amp;#39;re all sort of</text>
  <text start="254.859" dur="4.38">kettled on a bridge Mexico is not</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="2.94">letting the men there getting violent</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="6.141">they&amp;#39;ve been attacking some of the</text>
  <text start="260.799" dur="7.561">police and let me show you guys here you</text>
  <text start="265.38" dur="6.16">can kind of see how there</text>
  <text start="268.36" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re really getting aggressive trying</text>
  <text start="271.54" dur="4.8">to tear down fences that guy&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="274.57" dur="6.63">ready to succeed too they&amp;#39;re gonna pull</text>
  <text start="276.34" dur="7.56">that fence down but Mexico has already</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="5.31">had to fire tear gas into the crowds and</text>
  <text start="283.9" dur="4.05">they have started setting up camp on the</text>
  <text start="286.51" dur="11.31">bridge itself so the bridge is</text>
  <text start="287.95" dur="11.49">completely unusable as of right now in</text>
  <text start="297.82" dur="6.06">fact I had I had one of my people that</text>
  <text start="299.44" dur="6.68">reached out to me told me kind of their</text>
  <text start="303.88" dur="4.47">experience as they live in that area and</text>
  <text start="306.12" dur="3.11">said it was getting violent said it was</text>
  <text start="308.35" dur="8.159">doing in a while</text>

  <text start="322.84" dur="5.84">so not Jordan but Meadows was calling</text>
  <text start="325" dur="3.68">and Rosenstein to resign immediately and</text>
  <text start="328.949" dur="8.291">before I let&amp;#39;s see I got a couple of</text>
  <text start="334.24" dur="4.17">comments recently and usually this kind</text>
  <text start="337.24" dur="3.78">of stuff I don&amp;#39;t really care about it</text>
  <text start="338.41" dur="5.91">but somebody named Barrett harms</text>
  <text start="341.02" dur="5.61">obviously not a real name let me just</text>
  <text start="344.32" dur="3.81">kind of read through this it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="2.909">make a lot of sense bear with me but</text>
  <text start="348.13" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s obviously some parts here that</text>
  <text start="349.539" dur="7.201">I&amp;#39;m gonna have issue with destiny miss</text>
  <text start="352.69" dur="5.819">you give me no choice you tell me</text>

  <text start="387.909" dur="6.151">it&amp;#39;s a big what was me my life sucks</text>
  <text start="390.849" dur="5.761">I&amp;#39;m a 90 fuh I guess he&amp;#39;s getting paid</text>

  <text start="398.349" dur="4.411">the threat to my child for those who</text>
  <text start="400.84" dur="3.54">have been around the while obviously you</text>
  <text start="402.76" dur="5.37">know my baby is part of my life this is</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="7.86">a welcome invitation into my home this</text>

  <text start="413.229" dur="5.881">show your baby it&amp;#39;s dangerous that&amp;#39;s why</text>

  <text start="423.789" dur="5.22">my back when I do this kind of work and</text>
  <text start="426.099" dur="5.641">expose these kind of people and I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="429.009" dur="5.371">think of a safer place to be tactically</text>
  <text start="431.74" dur="5.07">speaking than in the public eye and that</text>
  <text start="434.38" dur="5.64">includes my daughter my wife is shy she</text>
  <text start="436.81" dur="4.77">won&amp;#39;t come on but you know these people</text>
  <text start="440.02" dur="5.369">are now trying to threaten my daughter</text>
  <text start="441.58" dur="8.389">so the next video should give you kind</text>
  <text start="445.389" dur="4.58">of an idea of how that would go</text>
  <text start="452.47" dur="5.86">for those who haven&amp;#39;t seen it this is</text>
  <text start="454.67" dur="6.24">some lefty Punk basically trying to</text>
  <text start="458.33" dur="4.26">harass this woman whose husband died in</text>

  <text start="462.59" dur="21.12">responders or something let me turn it</text>
  <text start="464.96" dur="20.79">up so you can hear it well so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.71" dur="26.36">obviously a jerk here&amp;#39;s what happens</text>
  <text start="485.75" dur="24.32">next in the grave to a 9/11 Widow</text>
  <text start="513.28" dur="6.08">[Music]</text>
  <text start="516.36" dur="3">yep</text>
  <text start="523.25" dur="4.22">[Music]</text>
  <text start="524.88" dur="4">you get the point the bit the videos the</text>
  <text start="527.47" dur="3.9">whole video is basically this guy</text>
  <text start="528.88" dur="4.23">running away like a little coward and</text>
  <text start="531.37" dur="3.12">that&amp;#39;s exactly what would happen if you</text>
  <text start="533.11" dur="2.7">show up to my home looking for trouble</text>
  <text start="534.49" dur="4.19">because there&amp;#39;s never been a single</text>
  <text start="535.81" dur="6.3">antifoam member that I&amp;#39;ve been afraid of</text>
  <text start="538.68" dur="5.35">obviously it&amp;#39;s just coward talking on</text>
  <text start="542.11" dur="5.31">the internet some keyboard warrior but I</text>
  <text start="544.03" dur="4.89">felt like it was worth addressing if for</text>
  <text start="547.42" dur="3.51">no other reason then you know these</text>
  <text start="548.92" dur="3.21">people make threats all the time the</text>
  <text start="550.93" dur="3.54">rights of murder threats of</text>
  <text start="552.13" dur="4.65">assassination they all they can do is</text>
  <text start="554.47" dur="5.7">lash out like little children but when</text>
  <text start="556.78" dur="5.55">confronted by you know men they run away</text>
  <text start="560.17" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll attack women they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="562.33" dur="6.21">attack in groups they will they will do</text>
  <text start="565.15" dur="6.18">every little sucker punch or sending</text>
  <text start="568.54" dur="5.1">mean letters with potentially real ricin</text>
  <text start="571.33" dur="5.66">and as they&amp;#39;ve been doing lately but</text>
  <text start="573.64" dur="7.92">when it comes to you know actually</text>
  <text start="576.99" dur="7.42">making a confrontation never never on</text>
  <text start="581.56" dur="5.52">fair terms so don&amp;#39;t come around here</text>
  <text start="584.41" dur="4.65">looking for trouble with that said that</text>
  <text start="587.08" dur="5.46">is most of what I wanted to cover let me</text>
  <text start="589.06" dur="6.9">do another quick check just in case q</text>
  <text start="592.54" dur="6.81">and on has said anything else I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="595.96" dur="6.21">think so I don&amp;#39;t really expect anything</text>
  <text start="599.35" dur="7.08">else to show up until closer to midterms</text>
  <text start="602.17" dur="5.91">anyway I will mention this red October</text>
  <text start="606.43" dur="6.81">has been a recurring theme through the</text>
  <text start="608.08" dur="8.72">almost a year of Q now very close to a</text>
  <text start="613.24" dur="3.56">year if not if not a year now so</text>
  <text start="618.57" dur="4.59">Red October could mean a lot of things</text>
  <text start="620.43" dur="4.83">obviously especially when you take the</text>
  <text start="623.16" dur="3.989">hunt for the Red October or the hunt or</text>
  <text start="625.26" dur="3.06">just the Red October so sometimes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="627.149" dur="3.421">in there sometimes it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="628.32" dur="5.25">I could mean subs it could mean other</text>
  <text start="630.57" dur="6.62">things but considering the date October</text>
  <text start="633.57" dur="8.009">November it could also be a reference to</text>
  <text start="637.19" dur="6.19">the Bolshevik Revolution you know I</text>
  <text start="641.579" dur="4.921">think I mentioned this last year about</text>
  <text start="643.38" dur="5.399">this time as well but these people in</text>
  <text start="646.5" dur="4.589">the elite they have a thing for numbers</text>
  <text start="648.779" dur="5.971">and dates and even the anti-shah</text>
  <text start="651.089" dur="6.151">understand the relevance of the Red</text>
  <text start="654.75" dur="5.13">October date that was kind of a special</text>
  <text start="657.24" dur="7.32">day for the Bolshevik revolutionary</text>
  <text start="659.88" dur="8.19">types in Russia the communist mass</text>
  <text start="664.56" dur="5.61">murdering gulang types so I would not be</text>
  <text start="668.07" dur="6.84">surprised if there&amp;#39;s some sort of mass</text>
  <text start="670.17" dur="6.9">violence or you know organized or you</text>
  <text start="674.91" dur="4.049">know it&amp;#39;s also worth mentioning that I</text>
  <text start="677.07" dur="4.59">think it was November 7th was the actual</text>
  <text start="678.959" dur="4.44">date for the Red October because there</text>
  <text start="681.66" dur="2.94">were two different calendars so in our</text>
  <text start="683.399" dur="4.021">calendar it would been it would have</text>
  <text start="684.6" dur="7.59">been November 7th so very very much</text>
  <text start="687.42" dur="6.05">right after midterms so I just want</text>
  <text start="692.19" dur="3.209">people to be aware of that just in case</text>
  <text start="693.47" dur="3.82">someone sent me a letter kind of</text>
