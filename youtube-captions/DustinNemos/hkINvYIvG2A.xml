  <text start="177.54" dur="5.069">even didn&amp;#39;t even happen right so they</text>
  <text start="180.45" dur="4.83">were trying to create this false</text>
  <text start="182.609" dur="4.651">narrative this false story creating fake</text>
  <text start="185.28" dur="7.56">news actually caught in the act of</text>

  <text start="217.199" dur="3.54">that they were talking about and even in</text>
  <text start="218.879" dur="5.401">their story even than the official BBC</text>
  <text start="220.739" dur="6.301">story they was supposed to have fired</text>
  <text start="224.28" dur="4.049">one tank shot and instead that were</text>
  <text start="227.04" dur="3.449">holes everywhere throughout the building</text>
  <text start="228.329" dur="3.75">makes no sense right so please check</text>
  <text start="230.489" dur="3.93">that one out as well it&amp;#39;s kind of a good</text>
  <text start="232.079" dur="4.321">you know this stuff happens all the time</text>
  <text start="234.419" dur="4.29">but it&amp;#39;s a great primer about how these</text>
  <text start="236.4" dur="5.009">things work how their</text>
  <text start="238.709" dur="4.231">creating these fake news events to play</text>
  <text start="241.409" dur="3.571">your heartstrings to to play on your</text>
  <text start="242.94" dur="3.389">emotions and this is a it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="246.329" dur="5.34">Islamists do but a lot of times it is</text>
  <text start="249.419" dur="3.69">and that&amp;#39;s very similar to what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="251.669" dur="3.81">on with these chemical weapons attacks</text>
  <text start="253.109" dur="3.84">Assad has no reason to do so there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="255.479" dur="4.801">incentive to do so there&amp;#39;s every reason</text>
  <text start="256.949" dur="4.831">to not do so therefore who benefits well</text>
  <text start="260.28" dur="2.91">the terrorists would benefit if they can</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="3.72">start World War three between the US and</text>
