  <text start="488.33" dur="5.37">day trying to blame it on a chanting q</text>
  <text start="491.48" dur="4.08">and on in our movement I honestly think</text>
  <text start="493.7" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s a good thing that a chant is down</text>

  <text start="525.74" dur="4.41">kill everyone else</text>

  <text start="606.339" dur="5.67">when that pressure has to be relieved I</text>
  <text start="609.399" dur="5.49">mean it&amp;#39;s gonna mean justice be done</text>
  <text start="612.009" dur="5.101">basically at a legal level of course but</text>
  <text start="614.889" dur="4.081">people will be so tired of the injustice</text>

  <text start="631.689" dur="2.731">go down</text>
  <text start="632.41" dur="3.869">that&amp;#39;s how energetics work I mean</text>
  <text start="634.42" dur="3.63">eventually you get to the point where</text>
  <text start="636.279" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s like a revolution and not that</text>
  <text start="638.05" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;m calling for one few peaceful Great</text>
  <text start="640.089" dur="3.84">Awakening revolution yeah but eventually</text>
  <text start="642.16" dur="5.029">you get to that let them eat cake moment</text>
  <text start="643.929" dur="9.361">and heads roll politically speaking and</text>
  <text start="647.189" dur="8.2">that&amp;#39;s the way of history it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="653.29" dur="4.38">basically bad people pushing too far too</text>

  <text start="733.069" dur="3.96">here is that things are going very well</text>
  <text start="735.439" dur="4.62">things are going according to the plan</text>
  <text start="737.029" dur="4.86">the problem is that it always has to be</text>
  <text start="740.059" dur="3.87">vague it always has to be sort of subtle</text>
  <text start="741.889" dur="4.05">and it always has to have that air of</text>
  <text start="743.929" dur="3.981">doubt and mystery because that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="745.939" dur="4.231">keeps everyone guessing on both sides</text>
  <text start="747.91" dur="3.7">obviously with Biden and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="750.17" dur="4.229">happening there it&amp;#39;s gonna take him out</text>
  <text start="751.61" dur="4.889">of the 2020 race at the very least he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2229.55" dur="3.66">idea where you know I was I was the guy</text>
  <text start="2231.89" dur="4.02">in the Q movement that was always</text>
  <text start="2233.21" dur="6.21">calling for the transparency right and I</text>
  <text start="2235.91" dur="6.15">wanted to basically expose everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2239.42" dur="3.99">deception on both sides you know I go</text>
  <text start="2242.06" dur="3.27">after the left - I mean I helped</text>
  <text start="2243.41" dur="4.2">everyone else in this movement and we</text>
  <text start="2245.33" dur="5.46">all helped to break the fake news we</text>
  <text start="2247.61" dur="6.45">broke the MS msq told us to do and I</text>
  <text start="2250.79" dur="5.22">think that was the whole point but I</text>
  <text start="2254.06" dur="4.38">want to create more transparency on our</text>
  <text start="2256.01" dur="4.14">side because you know I&amp;#39;ve always said</text>
  <text start="2258.44" dur="5.28">this now President Trump is saying this</text>
  <text start="2260.15" dur="5.43">as well but Fox News Infowars things</text>
  <text start="2263.72" dur="3">like that I mean even President Trump is</text>
  <text start="2265.58" dur="3.45">saying we need to find someone else</text>
  <text start="2266.72" dur="4.08">besides Fox we need to go somewhere else</text>
  <text start="2269.03" dur="4.52">besides Fox we need to have lawsuits</text>
  <text start="2270.8" dur="5.19">against big big tech things like that</text>
  <text start="2273.55" dur="5.35">and we can&amp;#39;t trust these people we have</text>
  <text start="2275.99" dur="5.94">to be very careful who we trust and who</text>
  <text start="2278.9" dur="6.72">on our team that we actually allow to</text>
  <text start="2281.93" dur="6.69">tell us the truth and not everyone on</text>
  <text start="2285.62" dur="5.82">our team is on our team you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2288.62" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s the idea that the</text>
  <text start="2291.44" dur="3.33">people in front of you shaking the</text>
  <text start="2293" dur="3.6">swords or in this case the the</text>
  <text start="2294.77" dur="3.57">microphones and the cameras the fake</text>
  <text start="2296.6" dur="2.88">news you know that&amp;#39;s an army of them out</text>
  <text start="2298.34" dur="3.93">there and they hate us and they want to</text>
  <text start="2299.48" dur="6.03">destroy us and I get that but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2302.27" dur="5.64">not that scary the the people on our own</text>
  <text start="2305.51" dur="4.59">team with a knife to our backs the knife</text>
  <text start="2307.91" dur="4.02">to president Trump&amp;#39;s back that is what</text>
  <text start="2310.1" dur="4.11">scares me the most guys that is where</text>
  <text start="2311.93" dur="5.19">the most danger lies that is where the</text>
  <text start="2314.21" dur="6.36">most damage is being done if it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2317.12" dur="5.94">for Fox News redirecting people as they</text>
  <text start="2320.57" dur="4.35">wake up back to sleep we would have</text>
  <text start="2323.06" dur="5.6">already had a country back I mean we</text>
  <text start="2324.92" dur="6">would have already won this thing so I</text>
  <text start="2328.66" dur="4.09">think that we should actually create</text>
  <text start="2330.92" dur="4.74">something like a fake Magga calm where</text>
  <text start="2332.75" dur="5.36">everyone is like a wiki style you can</text>
  <text start="2335.66" dur="3.57">just put it up for everyone all of the</text>
  <text start="2338.11" dur="3.31">allegations</text>
  <text start="2339.23" dur="4.11">you know unfounded or not and then</text>
  <text start="2341.42" dur="3.93">people keep counter with a rebuttal just</text>
  <text start="2343.34" dur="5.82">like a debate and then it&amp;#39;s all in one</text>
  <text start="2345.35" dur="6.12">place and it&amp;#39;s all sort of documented</text>
  <text start="2349.16" dur="5.55">and we can see who we can trust we can</text>
  <text start="2351.47" dur="5.1">see who&amp;#39;s in who&amp;#39;s controversial you</text>
  <text start="2354.71" dur="4.83">know maybe people are saying don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="2356.57" dur="5.1">them maybe that&amp;#39;s a truth maybe that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2359.54" dur="3.81">you need to dig into it more deeply and</text>
  <text start="2361.67" dur="3.99">maybe they actually have an argument as</text>
  <text start="2363.35" dur="3.72">to why it&amp;#39;s not real but I think</text>
  <text start="2365.66" dur="2.85">everyone should have this kind of if</text>
  <text start="2367.07" dur="5.53">they&amp;#39;re a public figure they should have</text>
  <text start="2368.51" dur="7.48">sort of a public almost like a Wikipedia</text>
  <text start="2372.6" dur="5.64">where they&amp;#39;re judged for any corruption</text>
  <text start="2375.99" dur="4.2">and in their past and that&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="2378.24" dur="3.84">way ask you said transparency is needed</text>
  <text start="2380.19" dur="6.78">and I think more than anything it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2382.08" dur="8.39">needed in our media on our team as Q</text>
  <text start="2386.97" dur="3.5">says be careful who you trust</text>
