  <text start="15.44" dur="6.28">welcome back my friends this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="18.12" dur="6.69">Nemo&amp;#39;s so I&amp;#39;m gonna cover a lot of stuff</text>
  <text start="21.72" dur="5.79">today in Magga world I spent most of my</text>
  <text start="24.81" dur="5.43">day yesterday doing a Q&amp;amp;A on updates so</text>
  <text start="27.51" dur="4.29">I kind of threw a couple things over for</text>
  <text start="30.24" dur="4.08">today so it&amp;#39;s gonna be yesterday and</text>
  <text start="31.8" dur="3.84">today&amp;#39;s mega update if you stay tuned to</text>
  <text start="34.32" dur="2.67">the end I&amp;#39;m gonna read a poem that I</text>
  <text start="35.64" dur="3.57">found that I really like I actually</text>
  <text start="36.99" dur="4.65">found it years ago and it just came up</text>
  <text start="39.21" dur="4.47">on my my Facebook feed and the memories</text>
  <text start="41.64" dur="3.689">thing so I was gonna share that with you</text>
  <text start="43.68" dur="5.78">guys I think it&amp;#39;s kind of relevant to</text>
  <text start="45.329" dur="8.311">today so let&amp;#39;s jump right in there</text>
  <text start="49.46" dur="7.39">there is a court decision that could</text>
  <text start="53.64" dur="4.77">help to ban a water fluoridation all</text>
  <text start="56.85" dur="3.779">right there are people obviously out</text>
  <text start="58.41" dur="3.48">there against fluoride challenging it in</text>
  <text start="60.629" dur="5.911">the courts</text>
  <text start="61.89" dur="6.51">the EPA basically tried to dismiss their</text>
  <text start="66.54" dur="3.21">arguments their side of the arguments</text>
  <text start="68.4" dur="3.75">and tell the court that they had to go</text>
  <text start="69.75" dur="3.96">on just what the EPA says just the</text>
  <text start="72.15" dur="3.21">information that we provide is all that</text>
  <text start="73.71" dur="6.089">you can use to make a decision against</text>
  <text start="75.36" dur="7.5">us basically and the court rejected them</text>
  <text start="79.799" dur="6.991">surprisingly so this is one possible</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="6.119">step toward a fluoride free country and</text>
  <text start="86.79" dur="3.81">for those who you know obviously I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="88.979" dur="3.271">been talking about this a lot if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="90.6" dur="4.199">been following my work you understand</text>
  <text start="92.25" dur="3.899">this if you follow alternative medicine</text>
  <text start="94.799" dur="4.081">or even true their topics you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="96.149" dur="5.79">probably heard about fluoride it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="98.88" dur="5.269">bad news you could consider fluoride to</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="5.54">be the thing that eats away at your soul</text>
  <text start="104.149" dur="6.491">because it calcifies your pineal gland</text>
  <text start="107.479" dur="6.64">your third eye which is an actual organ</text>
  <text start="110.64" dur="7.17">in your brain and it sort of functions</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="7.5">as the the spiritual self the center of</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="5.729">your higher self you might say so what</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="4.081">are the effects of fluoride well they</text>
  <text start="123.539" dur="4.351">put it in there supposedly allegedly for</text>
  <text start="125.7" dur="4.949">your teeth which was based on a very old</text>
  <text start="127.89" dur="4.56">study that suggests that some fluoride</text>
  <text start="130.649" dur="4.921">topically on just the tooth not</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="4.62">swallowed could be beneficial of course</text>
  <text start="135.57" dur="2.82">that was a completely different kind of</text>
  <text start="137.07" dur="3.51">fluoride now they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="138.39" dur="4.52">hydrofluoric acid I think it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="140.58" dur="7.87">and this is like a</text>
  <text start="142.91" dur="7.59">a toxic waste chemical byproduct of</text>
  <text start="148.45" dur="4.48">phosphate mining or something like that</text>
  <text start="150.5" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s very very very toxic I actually I</text>
  <text start="152.93" dur="3">think it&amp;#39;s transported and the toxic</text>
  <text start="154.49" dur="3.09">waste stuff and if they spill it they</text>
  <text start="155.93" dur="3.75">have to bring out the hazmat suits and</text>
  <text start="157.58" dur="4.95">everything but they dump it right in</text>
  <text start="159.68" dur="4.32">your water and they put it in your</text>
  <text start="162.53" dur="5.13">toothpaste and stuff now some of the</text>
  <text start="164" dur="6.39">effects besides the the brain thing</text>
  <text start="167.66" dur="4.41">also it causes apathy causes you to care</text>
  <text start="170.39" dur="5.49">less about the world and everything else</text>
  <text start="172.07" dur="5.22">even your family it causes it sort of</text>
  <text start="175.88" dur="3">dulls you out you know that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="177.29" dur="3.32">like to put it in the water it makes you</text>
  <text start="178.88" dur="3.81">care less about the corruption and</text>
  <text start="180.61" dur="5.23">tyranny that they&amp;#39;re trying to put down</text>
  <text start="182.69" dur="5.04">our throats it causes the little white</text>
  <text start="185.84" dur="5.46">spots on children&amp;#39;s teeth called dental</text>
  <text start="187.73" dur="6.78">fluorosis it causes lower IQ especially</text>
  <text start="191.3" dur="4.83">in children you know dramatic IQ</text>
  <text start="194.51" dur="3.15">reduction actually even Harvard</text>
  <text start="196.13" dur="4.68">mentioned that now recently in the last</text>
  <text start="197.66" dur="4.89">couple years that came out so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="3.75">fairly well known mainstream knowledge</text>
  <text start="202.55" dur="5.1">at this point obviously politics are</text>
  <text start="204.56" dur="4.17">always slower to catch up another reason</text>
  <text start="207.65" dur="4.01">the free market is better than</text>
  <text start="208.73" dur="5.67">government at regulating behavior but</text>
  <text start="211.66" dur="4">people who are aware of it have already</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="2.46">gotten the water filters and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="215.66" dur="3.18">trying to get it out of their systems</text>
  <text start="216.86" dur="5.49">and out of their body into detox like</text>
  <text start="218.84" dur="5.61">things like that you know for for over a</text>
  <text start="222.35" dur="3.45">year my water filter didn&amp;#39;t even I grew</text>
  <text start="224.45" dur="3.03">up on low water but I didn&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="225.8" dur="3.18">that my water filter did not completely</text>
  <text start="227.48" dur="3.96">filter out fluoride I had to buy a</text>
  <text start="228.98" dur="3.66">separate attachment for that so for a</text>
  <text start="231.44" dur="4.049">year I was drinking about half</text>
  <text start="232.64" dur="4.29">fluoridated water so I am I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="235.489" dur="4.081">nervous about that myself now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="236.93" dur="5.37">actually taking I think about half a</text>
  <text start="239.57" dur="8.25">spoon of boron every day which is</text>
  <text start="242.3" dur="7.17">basically borax a cleaning agent and in</text>
  <text start="247.82" dur="3.12">small doses it&amp;#39;s actually found in a lot</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="4.05">of foods like avocados things like that</text>
  <text start="250.94" dur="4.98">so in small doses it actually helps to</text>
  <text start="253.52" dur="5.04">massively decalcify your pineal gland</text>
  <text start="255.92" dur="4.999">other things would be like turmeric</text>
  <text start="258.56" dur="5.13">turmeric is great for it as well so</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="6.611">there are options that you can try to do</text>
  <text start="263.69" dur="6.06">to heal but prevention is what is it an</text>
  <text start="267.53" dur="5.91">ounce of prevention is worth a pound or</text>
  <text start="269.75" dur="5.729">in this case a ton of cure so please</text>
  <text start="273.44" dur="3.449">please please if you are already if</text>
  <text start="275.479" dur="3.361">you&amp;#39;re on the fluoride water</text>
  <text start="276.889" dur="3.87">I get rid of it if you are taking hot</text>
  <text start="278.84" dur="4.02">showers on public water and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.759" dur="5.22">getting all that steam then that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="282.86" dur="4.619">major source of fluoride so you know</text>
  <text start="285.979" dur="3.99">please be aware of that you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="287.479" dur="5.881">that it&amp;#39;s also coating on floss it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="289.969" dur="5.01">a lot of the toothpastes alternatives</text>
  <text start="293.36" dur="3.179">there will actually save you money get</text>
  <text start="294.979" dur="3.15">you some of the string that the kind of</text>
  <text start="296.539" dur="3.481">string that&amp;#39;s really hard to break I</text>
  <text start="298.129" dur="4.711">don&amp;#39;t know the different kinds of string</text>
  <text start="300.02" dur="5.729">but you can use that as a floss rather</text>
  <text start="302.84" dur="5.21">than the the coated flossing packs they</text>
  <text start="305.749" dur="4.681">sell which are waste of money anyway and</text>
  <text start="308.05" dur="4.479">you won&amp;#39;t have the fluoride issue in</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="4.049">your in your body from that get you some</text>
  <text start="312.529" dur="3.6">fluoride free toothpaste you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="314.479" dur="4.981">not gonna go too long on this issue but</text>
  <text start="316.129" dur="5.611">it&amp;#39;s very important and if we could ban</text>
  <text start="319.46" dur="5.34">it across the country you would begin to</text>
  <text start="321.74" dur="5.549">see a different world in probably a</text>
  <text start="324.8" dur="6.269">generation or less because the IQ</text>
  <text start="327.289" dur="6.69">difference and the apathy issue would</text>
  <text start="331.069" dur="7.68">mean a lot lot a lot more people would</text>
  <text start="333.979" dur="6.75">be awoken and read pilled or woke or</text>
  <text start="338.749" dur="3.57">whatever you want to say because they</text>
  <text start="340.729" dur="5.84">would be a little bit less susceptible</text>
  <text start="342.319" dur="7.201">to the BS so jumping onto the next topic</text>
  <text start="346.569" dur="7.21">there is a presidential executive order</text>
  <text start="349.52" dur="9.54">that is potentially restoring the rule</text>
  <text start="353.779" dur="7.92">of law and the in the waters of the</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="4.859">United States rule now this is basically</text>
  <text start="361.699" dur="4.411">the rule where the government owns</text>
  <text start="363.919" dur="4.291">everything that&amp;#39;s got water in it if</text>
  <text start="366.11" dur="3.869">you&amp;#39;ve got a pond on your land or a</text>
  <text start="368.21" dur="4.939">puddle it&amp;#39;s theirs they own and they can</text>
  <text start="369.979" dur="7.981">do what they want with it this is a</text>
  <text start="373.149" dur="7.091">massively authoritarian power grab</text>
  <text start="377.96" dur="4.139">it was very unconstitutional it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="380.24" dur="4.859">immoral it doesn&amp;#39;t serve any useful</text>
  <text start="382.099" dur="5.22">purpose of course they sell it as an</text>
  <text start="385.099" dur="3.6">environmental thing but we also</text>
  <text start="387.319" dur="4.83">understand that the government is</text>
  <text start="388.699" dur="4.981">terrible at actually maintaining</text>
  <text start="392.149" dur="4.591">anything look at all the forest fires</text>
  <text start="393.68" dur="8.219">that keep happening in the West mostly</text>
  <text start="396.74" dur="6.419">because of government forestry ok when</text>
  <text start="401.899" dur="3.601">you have a large tract of forest</text>
  <text start="403.159" dur="4.41">especially in a place that is prone to</text>
  <text start="405.5" dur="3.419">forest fires which are natural in</text>
  <text start="407.569" dur="2.041">they&amp;#39;re good for the you know good for</text>
  <text start="408.919" dur="3.481">the</text>
  <text start="409.61" dur="5.579">a cycle of life in the reforestation and</text>
  <text start="412.4" dur="4.62">all that stuff because eventually older</text>
  <text start="415.189" dur="4.32">forests can often get sick and all that</text>
  <text start="417.02" dur="4.23">other stuff but when there&amp;#39;s homes and</text>
  <text start="419.509" dur="3.96">people nearby it needs to be done in a</text>
  <text start="421.25" dur="5.699">better way you don&amp;#39;t want just random</text>
  <text start="423.469" dur="6.271">forest fires infernos they&amp;#39;ll turn into</text>
  <text start="426.949" dur="5.041">a lot of times it comes from the</text>
  <text start="429.74" dur="3.919">government land because the BLM out</text>
  <text start="431.99" dur="4.859">there the same people that basically</text>
  <text start="433.659" dur="5.29">were involved in the murder and coverup</text>
  <text start="436.849" dur="5.28">and all that stuff going on down in the</text>
  <text start="438.949" dur="4.83">Bundy case well those guys leave tons</text>
  <text start="442.129" dur="4.891">and tons and tons of fuel on the ground</text>
  <text start="443.779" dur="5.781">which do you know deadly Deadwood things</text>
  <text start="447.02" dur="5.429">of that nature fallen trees branches</text>
  <text start="449.56" dur="5.05">this is called fuel in forestry terms</text>
  <text start="452.449" dur="3.631">and when they leave like five hundred</text>
  <text start="454.61" dur="2.279">times more on the ground than is</text>
  <text start="456.08" dur="3.54">supposed to be there</text>
  <text start="456.889" dur="7.58">you have a greater risk of forest fire</text>
  <text start="459.62" dur="7.919">and massive massive forest fire that is</text>
  <text start="464.469" dur="5.771">obviously lethal to humans and dangerous</text>
  <text start="467.539" dur="4.44">to property so we don&amp;#39;t want them</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="5.609">involved in controlling our forests or</text>
  <text start="471.979" dur="5.521">our water basically private property</text>
  <text start="475.849" dur="3.63">would do a lot better job at it because</text>
  <text start="477.5" dur="5.37">at least then there&amp;#39;s some incentive to</text>
  <text start="479.479" dur="7.351">care for the land and the property now</text>
  <text start="482.87" dur="5.699">the culturally speaking politics are</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="4.29">downstream from culture like the late</text>
  <text start="488.569" dur="5.94">great Andrew Breitbart said culturally</text>
  <text start="491.12" dur="7.259">speaking the NR a is seeing memberships</text>
  <text start="494.509" dur="5.31">or after the Florida Massacre and all of</text>
  <text start="498.379" dur="4.71">the gun control pushing that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="499.819" dur="7.53">with it so the goal was to cut their</text>
  <text start="503.089" dur="6.091">funding and to make them a pariah now</text>
  <text start="507.349" dur="2.97">the Democrats in some cases are even</text>
  <text start="509.18" dur="4.95">calling for murdering and already</text>
  <text start="510.319" dur="7.321">members you know that there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="514.13" dur="5.399">very violent very violent group on the</text>
  <text start="517.64" dur="4.649">far left which is pretty much the</text>
  <text start="519.529" dur="5.67">mainstream left at this point at least</text>
  <text start="522.289" dur="5.031">in the the the influencer circles like</text>
  <text start="525.199" dur="5.13">the media and the politicians and in the</text>
  <text start="527.32" dur="4.74">organizers maybe not the average leftist</text>
  <text start="530.329" dur="5.101">but you get my point</text>
  <text start="532.06" dur="6.009">so the NRA is gonna be stronger than</text>
  <text start="535.43" dur="4.24">ever a couple couple places cut ties</text>
  <text start="538.069" dur="4.091">with them like Delta</text>
  <text start="539.67" dur="5.22">over 13 and RA members that actually</text>
  <text start="542.16" dur="4.65">used the discount with them and then</text>
  <text start="544.89" dur="3.75">they lost multi Multi multi millions of</text>
  <text start="546.81" dur="6.21">tax breaks for it I think that was in</text>
  <text start="548.64" dur="5.94">Georgia so it&amp;#39;s okay no big deal these</text>
  <text start="553.02" dur="3.51">companies are just gonna face our wrath</text>
  <text start="554.58" dur="3.6">now in the free market we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="556.53" dur="2.94">choose to not do business with them and</text>
  <text start="558.18" dur="3">that&amp;#39;s gonna be wonderful</text>
  <text start="559.47" dur="6.24">we&amp;#39;re gonna punish them that way no</text>
  <text start="561.18" dur="5.46">violence necessary and the worth and</text>
  <text start="565.71" dur="4.5">worth a note</text>
  <text start="566.64" dur="4.95">FedEx stood with them so shop FedEx if</text>
  <text start="570.21" dur="2.9">you&amp;#39;re gonna be shipping anything or at</text>
  <text start="571.59" dur="6.66">least consider it</text>
  <text start="573.11" dur="8.53">now I&amp;#39;m not gonna go into it too much</text>
  <text start="578.25" dur="5.75">but the in Germany the German version of</text>
  <text start="581.64" dur="11.16">Hillary Clinton won her fourth term</text>
  <text start="584" dur="11.61">Angela Merkel now see Facebook shut down</text>
  <text start="592.8" dur="2.81">gateway ponder</text>
  <text start="599.73" dur="5.579">YouTube deletes natural news I like</text>
  <text start="603.899" dur="2.61">natural news a lot I mean I like gonna</text>
  <text start="605.309" dur="4.55">Gateway pundit too but I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="606.509" dur="3.35">following natural news for a long time</text>
  <text start="610.069" dur="8.74">they do a really good job I think of</text>
  <text start="612.509" dur="9.57">covering the the Nexus of politics and</text>
  <text start="618.809" dur="5.28">health and they have a food news and</text>
  <text start="622.079" dur="3.3">medicine news alternate websites that</text>
  <text start="624.089" dur="6.72">kind of cover those issues as well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="625.379" dur="8.94">actually a fairly big operation Hillary</text>
  <text start="630.809" dur="5.61">Clinton was bragging about how she saw</text>
