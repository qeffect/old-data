  <text start="73.25" dur="4.11">so we&amp;#39;re gonna dive through this</text>
  <text start="74.84" dur="4.77">particularly interesting story Durham is</text>
  <text start="77.36" dur="5.13">closing in on Brennan and his</text>
  <text start="79.61" dur="5.85">communications with Comey so a quote</text>
  <text start="82.49" dur="5.1">here Durham has quote requested mr.</text>
  <text start="85.46" dur="4.95">Brennan&amp;#39;s emails call logs and other</text>
  <text start="87.59" dur="6.6">documents from the CIA according to a</text>
  <text start="90.41" dur="6.63">person briefed on his inquiry the from</text>
  <text start="94.19" dur="4.71">the New York Times even big surprise</text>
  <text start="97.04" dur="3.48">there they usually don&amp;#39;t tell anything</text>
  <text start="98.9" dur="3.329">negative about themselves or they they</text>
  <text start="100.52" dur="5.25">probably covered it up and you know deep</text>
  <text start="102.229" dur="5.101">in the story now also quote he wants to</text>
  <text start="105.77" dur="3.48">learn what mr. Brennan told other</text>
  <text start="107.33" dur="4.77">officials including the former FBI</text>
  <text start="109.25" dur="5.82">director James be calming about his and</text>
  <text start="112.1" dur="5.58">the CIA&amp;#39;s views of a notorious dossier</text>
  <text start="115.07" dur="5.25">of assertions about Russia and Trump</text>
  <text start="117.68" dur="5.7">associates you guys remember P P gate</text>
  <text start="120.32" dur="4.409">right the fake dossier and that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="123.38" dur="3.3">part of what they use to try to</text>
  <text start="124.729" dur="4.23">legitimize the entire coup d&amp;#39;etat</text>
  <text start="126.68" dur="4.47">investigation of course now we know that</text>
  <text start="128.959" dur="4.981">it was entirely bogus and we knew it at</text>
  <text start="131.15" dur="5.339">the time as well so we have a lot of</text>
  <text start="133.94" dur="5.13">evidence now that even Brennan himself</text>
  <text start="136.489" dur="4.47">is being investigated now on top of that</text>
  <text start="139.07" dur="3.449">and we&amp;#39;ve had a lot of bombshells just</text>
  <text start="140.959" dur="4.381">this week and in the past month</text>
  <text start="142.519" dur="4.651">especially Admiral Rogers coming out and</text>
  <text start="145.34" dur="4.02">helping Durham things like this this is</text>
  <text start="147.17" dur="4.68">big big deals guys and of course the</text>
  <text start="149.36" dur="4.62">fall apart or the breakdown I should say</text>
  <text start="151.85" dur="3.09">of the impeachment itself that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="153.98" dur="3.24">deal as well</text>
  <text start="154.94" dur="4.079">cultural that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s one of those</text>
  <text start="157.22" dur="3.239">things that reaches the normal folks out</text>
  <text start="159.019" dur="4.261">there that reaches the people who are</text>
  <text start="160.459" dur="4.861">not yet awake or woke to politics it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.28" dur="3.63">you know even your everyday average</text>
  <text start="165.32" dur="3.99">person who doesn&amp;#39;t give a crap about</text>
  <text start="166.91" dur="4.049">politics is gonna say they tried to</text>
  <text start="169.31" dur="3.959">impeach him and fail they got nothing so</text>
  <text start="170.959" dur="5.041">this is really the beginning of the end</text>
  <text start="173.269" dur="4.651">for the morale of the left now we also</text>
  <text start="176" dur="4.89">have bill bar of course in dining 8</text>
  <text start="177.92" dur="4.62">including top Mueller witness Nader</text>
  <text start="180.89" dur="5.069">Georg Nader if you guys remember him a</text>
  <text start="182.54" dur="4.74">convicted pedophile multiple crimes and</text>
  <text start="185.959" dur="3.631">multiple crimes including a</text>
  <text start="187.28" dur="4.049">fourteen-year-old boy at least attempted</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="5.64">I don&amp;#39;t know if he succeeded there but</text>
  <text start="191.329" dur="6.511">anyway bad enough to try I think the</text>
  <text start="195.23" dur="5.819">rest of them that her kids should be um</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="4.32">probably I think President Trump was</text>
  <text start="201.049" dur="3.121">absolutely right</text>
  <text start="202.16" dur="4.72">too many people hurting kids need to do</text>
  <text start="204.17" dur="5.35">something about it fast trials</text>
  <text start="206.88" dur="4.29">death penalty or hanging I think he said</text>
  <text start="209.52" dur="3.6">I don&amp;#39;t remember what he exactly quoted</text>
  <text start="211.17" dur="4.38">on that one anyway so new evidence</text>
  <text start="213.12" dur="3.89">around this of course the these eight</text>
  <text start="215.55" dur="3.9">that were indicted were funneling money</text>
  <text start="217.01" dur="4.36">in the large quantities of money</text>
  <text start="219.45" dur="5.28">illegally campaign contributions</text>
  <text start="221.37" dur="5.82">political donations to all sorts I mean</text>
  <text start="224.73" dur="5.43">the almost like all of the left multiple</text>
  <text start="227.19" dur="5.01">political leaders super PACs things like</text>
  <text start="230.16" dur="4.32">that these guys were just funneling</text>
  <text start="232.2" dur="4.89">money to them now some of that evidence</text>
  <text start="234.48" dur="5.04">also shows that the money was going to</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="5.16">Hillary and Bill Clinton and some of</text>
  <text start="239.52" dur="4.8">that evidence and may suggests also that</text>
  <text start="242.25" dur="4.53">some of the folks involved like Nader</text>
  <text start="244.32" dur="5.76">were serving the UAE the United Arab</text>
  <text start="246.78" dur="5.37">Emirates at a political or even</text>
  <text start="250.08" dur="4.62">governmental level may be serving their</text>
  <text start="252.15" dur="3.96">deep state as well now this is a big</text>
  <text start="254.7" dur="4.47">deal because it shows foreign</text>
  <text start="256.11" dur="5.4">interference directly into our leftist</text>
  <text start="259.17" dur="4.92">campaign contributions basically funding</text>
  <text start="261.51" dur="4.59">the leftist Democratic Party now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264.09" dur="4.8">not completely there yet but it looks</text>
  <text start="266.1" dur="6.12">very damning and also Hillary and Bill</text>
  <text start="268.89" dur="5.46">gave Nader a lot of access that&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="272.22" dur="3.75">the key points here he got access we</text>
  <text start="274.35" dur="3.06">can&amp;#39;t yet prove that Hillary knew that</text>
  <text start="275.97" dur="3">he was working for some other government</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="2.82">but we do know that he got a lot of</text>
  <text start="278.97" dur="3.6">access for that money that he was</text>
  <text start="280.23" dur="5.34">illegally passing out this child</text>
  <text start="282.57" dur="4.77">predator now continuing on it gets</text>
  <text start="285.57" dur="3.54">better and better and better I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="287.34" dur="4.44">to not smile but it&amp;#39;s almost Christmas</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="4.35">Eve right so just in time for Christmas</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re getting all these big bombshells</text>
  <text start="293.46" dur="4.86">crossfire hurricane the investigation</text>
  <text start="296.37" dur="5.01">into President Trump may have been a</text>
  <text start="298.32" dur="6.75">joint operation between the FBI and as I</text>
  <text start="301.38" dur="6.57">said the CIA it is starting to look a</text>
  <text start="305.07" dur="5.4">little obvious now if you look through</text>
  <text start="307.95" dur="4.83">some of these recent documents that have</text>
  <text start="310.47" dur="4.59">come out you can see some things that</text>
  <text start="312.78" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t necessarily jump out at you at</text>
  <text start="315.06" dur="4.74">first but have big implications behind</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="5.37">them such as the example that there were</text>
  <text start="319.8" dur="4.62">people such as Russian oligarch one who</text>
  <text start="322.62" dur="5.22">was the subject of a crossfire hurricane</text>
  <text start="324.42" dur="5.91">case now here&amp;#39;s a question ask yourself</text>
  <text start="327.84" dur="4.5">this who would investigate international</text>
  <text start="330.33" dur="4.32">right like if its domestic it&amp;#39;s the FBI</text>
  <text start="332.34" dur="4.74">if it&amp;#39;s international it should be the</text>
  <text start="334.65" dur="4.7">CIA and of course we already know</text>
  <text start="337.08" dur="4.85">Brennan was involved we already</text>
  <text start="339.35" dur="6.84">that he was involved and seen a lot of</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="5.55">the documents so there was also a quote</text>
  <text start="346.19" dur="3.57">in there to allow for better</text>
  <text start="347.48" dur="5.16">coordination with headquarters and enter</text>
  <text start="349.76" dur="5.22">agency partners and of course the</text>
  <text start="352.64" dur="4.8">question must be asked what interagency</text>
  <text start="354.98" dur="5.79">partners so if it was a joint operation</text>
  <text start="357.44" dur="5.34">between the CIA and FBI some of the</text>
  <text start="360.77" dur="4.8">statements made by page and Stroke and</text>
  <text start="362.78" dur="5.28">others in texts and elsewhere are more</text>
  <text start="365.57" dur="4.14">revealing so we still don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="368.06" dur="3.78">names of some of the key players in</text>
  <text start="369.71" dur="4.5">these fraudulent investigations and have</text>
  <text start="371.84" dur="4.53">to guess we don&amp;#39;t know how closely the</text>
  <text start="374.21" dur="4.29">FBI and CIA were connected during the</text>
  <text start="376.37" dur="4.98">sham and the deep state still won&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="378.5" dur="4.74">us what it what is it going to take</text>
  <text start="381.35" dur="3.96">before the Americans are provided the</text>
  <text start="383.24" dur="4.23">whole truth and nothing but the truth</text>
  <text start="385.31" dur="5.07">great article I highly suggest it at the</text>
  <text start="387.47" dur="4.62">gateway pundit now Graham here Lindsey</text>
  <text start="390.38" dur="3.18">Graham I&amp;#39;ve shown this in the cue video</text>
  <text start="392.09" dur="3.06">I&amp;#39;m going to show this in the regular</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="4.71">you know impeachment video because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="4.74">a it&amp;#39;s a big thing but you know I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="398.27" dur="3.51">little pessimistic on Lindsey Graham I</text>
  <text start="399.89" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t trust him I think that he has lied</text>
  <text start="401.78" dur="3.51">many times in the past and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="403.61" dur="4.86">expect that he will live up to his word</text>
  <text start="405.29" dur="6.81">in fact I would go so far as to say that</text>
  <text start="408.47" dur="5.25">he is a loudmouth do-nothing who never</text>
  <text start="412.1" dur="4.43">does anything that he says he&amp;#39;s gonna do</text>
  <text start="413.72" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s almost as though he&amp;#39;s just like um</text>
  <text start="416.53" dur="4.93">so I don&amp;#39;t know how to describe it one</text>
  <text start="419.12" dur="5.01">of those people that just has to always</text>
  <text start="421.46" dur="4.17">one-up everyone else yeah yeah I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="424.13" dur="3.03">know there&amp;#39;s a thing out there where</text>
  <text start="425.63" dur="3.06">there&amp;#39;s certain people they always have</text>
  <text start="427.16" dur="2.88">to be the best in the room at everything</text>
  <text start="428.69" dur="2.91">I used to have a best friend like this</text>
  <text start="430.04" dur="4.05">he was super competitive about</text>
  <text start="431.6" dur="4.44">everything and you know it eventually</text>
  <text start="434.09" dur="4.32">just kind of gotten irritating to be</text>
  <text start="436.04" dur="3.78">around them but with Lindsey Graham he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.41" dur="2.55">always saying I&amp;#39;m gonna do this I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="439.82" dur="2.58">gonna get to the bottom of it I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="440.96" dur="3.48">have investigations all this other stuff</text>
  <text start="442.4" dur="3.96">he says I&amp;#39;ll let you let&amp;#39;s listen to it</text>
  <text start="444.44" dur="4.02">in a moment but he never follows through</text>
  <text start="446.36" dur="3.45">and that&amp;#39;s my problem with Lindsey</text>
  <text start="448.46" dur="2.82">Graham now of course there&amp;#39;s also the</text>
  <text start="449.81" dur="3.54">fact that he used to be pretty deep</text>
  <text start="451.28" dur="4.11">state himself he finally turned Trump</text>
  <text start="453.35" dur="3.57">but did he really we have pictures of</text>
  <text start="455.39" dur="4.41">him right there between me Ivanovitch</text>
  <text start="456.92" dur="5.37">the fired ambassador who turned coup</text>
  <text start="459.8" dur="4.97">d&amp;#39;etat helper basically trying to</text>
  <text start="462.29" dur="4.89">overthrow President Trump and blocked</text>
  <text start="464.77" dur="6.55">Ukrainian officials from coming here to</text>
  <text start="467.18" dur="5.87">rat on the deep state and also McCain</text>
  <text start="471.32" dur="3.74">right so Lindsey Graham was pick</text>
  <text start="473.05" dur="4.86">right there between those two in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="475.06" dur="4.229">getting the medal of Ukraine or</text>
  <text start="477.91" dur="3.45">something it was called I think it was</text>
  <text start="479.289" dur="4.051">and they were over there together what</text>
  <text start="481.36" dur="3.54">were you doing Lindsey Graham how much</text>
  <text start="483.34" dur="3.96">guilt are you covering up and is that</text>
  <text start="484.9" dur="4.59">why you won&amp;#39;t do anything so continuing</text>
  <text start="487.3" dur="5.68">on let me show you and mute myself so</text>
  <text start="489.49" dur="7.03">you can judge for yourself his words</text>
  <text start="492.98" dur="6">FBI that is a great start they came down</text>
  <text start="496.52" dur="4.38">hard on the FBI if they had failed to do</text>
  <text start="498.98" dur="3.96">that I would have lost all confidence in</text>
  <text start="500.9" dur="5.64">the court Comey said last week he was</text>
  <text start="502.94" dur="6.18">sorry it was sloppy no call me it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="506.54" dur="4.23">sloppy it was criminal I&amp;#39;m going to call</text>
  <text start="509.12" dur="3.81">every person who signed the warrant</text>
  <text start="510.77" dur="4.53">application I&amp;#39;m gonna find out why</text>
  <text start="512.93" dur="5.58">Brennan went to Harry Reid in September</text>
  <text start="515.3" dur="5.85">of 2016 to talk about the investigation</text>
  <text start="518.51" dur="4.469">I&amp;#39;m gonna find out why it took two years</text>
  <text start="521.15" dur="4.23">from Muller to realize there was no</text>
  <text start="522.979" dur="4.891">there there we&amp;#39;re going to look long and</text>
  <text start="525.38" dur="3.96">hard at FISA abuse we&amp;#39;re going to pass</text>
  <text start="527.87" dur="2.37">laws to make sure this never happens</text>
  <text start="529.34" dur="3.12">again</text>
  <text start="530.24" dur="5.31">accountability will only be successful</text>
  <text start="532.46" dur="6.12">if somebody gets fired and I&amp;#39;m looking</text>
  <text start="535.55" dur="5.79">at Christopher Rea to fire somebody at</text>
  <text start="538.58" dur="5.07">the FBI and somebody needs to go to jail</text>
  <text start="541.34" dur="4.95">and I&amp;#39;m looking at Durham to hold people</text>
  <text start="543.65" dur="4.41">criminally accountable for the laws they</text>
  <text start="546.29" dur="2.97">broke well you make a good point and</text>
  <text start="548.06" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;ve got a graphic here that shows</text>
  <text start="549.26" dur="3.48">everybody who signed those warrants and</text>
  <text start="551.24" dur="3.96">you&amp;#39;re saying each of these people</text>
  <text start="552.74" dur="4.44">you&amp;#39;re gonna call down to testify that</text>
  <text start="555.2" dur="4.05">includes obviously James Comey signed</text>
  <text start="557.18" dur="5.07">the warrant three times Sally Yates</text>
  <text start="559.25" dur="5.46">signed it once you had Andrew McCabe his</text>
  <text start="562.25" dur="3.75">deputy signing it we have that graphic</text>
  <text start="564.71" dur="3.6">the Sally Yates as well</text>
  <text start="566" dur="5.1">all of those people you say you are</text>
  <text start="568.31" dur="4.5">gonna call to testify as you continue to</text>
  <text start="571.1" dur="6.36">do this deep dive into what took place</text>
  <text start="572.81" dur="6.96">in 2016 there&amp;#39;s two questions I want to</text>
