  <text start="530.699" dur="3.421">then have had a chance to look it over</text>
  <text start="532.74" dur="4.31">make sure that nothing is going to be</text>
  <text start="534.12" dur="5.279">bad and then what what can they say then</text>

  <text start="566.68" dur="7.29">blocking the devices and now he&amp;#39;s now</text>
  <text start="571.51" dur="6.27">blocked from signing new faces so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="573.97" dur="6.06">interesting and Q says all signers are</text>
  <text start="577.78" dur="5.31">currently under grand jury investigation</text>
  <text start="580.03" dur="6.6">now that&amp;#39;s a that in and of itself is a</text>

  <text start="594.97" dur="4.11">as I said right before midterms we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="596.86" dur="5.42">gonna see not the arrests necessarily</text>

  <text start="602.28" dur="4.45">guess I kind of called that but really I</text>
  <text start="605.17" dur="4.1">can&amp;#39;t claim credit for it I was just</text>
  <text start="606.73" dur="6.3">kind of following the trend</text>
  <text start="609.27" dur="6.43">he says McCabe memos New York Times</text>
  <text start="613.03" dur="7.74">Rosenstein article prove the rats are</text>
  <text start="615.7" dur="7.41">panicking so yeah I guess he&amp;#39;s referring</text>
  <text start="620.77" dur="4.38">to that op-ed about you know the deep</text>
  <text start="623.11" dur="6.87">state resisting Trump from within New</text>

  <text start="638.11" dur="5.34">ago I feel like I don&amp;#39;t sometimes time</text>
  <text start="640.72" dur="4.02">flies by or maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong but it seems</text>
  <text start="643.45" dur="3.68">like a few weeks ago I don&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="644.74" dur="5.79">the date he had basically made the</text>
  <text start="647.13" dur="5.74">comment 2018 will be glorious someone</text>
  <text start="650.53" dur="5.49">had said it&amp;#39;s already been glorious and</text>
  <text start="652.87" dur="5.82">then trunk you had said in our opinion</text>
  <text start="656.02" dur="4.98">it won&amp;#39;t be glorious until those evil</text>
  <text start="658.69" dur="5.24">are behind all this basically the bad</text>
  <text start="661" dur="6.48">guys were either dead or suffering so</text>
  <text start="663.93" dur="5.74">again 2018 is only a couple months left</text>
  <text start="667.48" dur="4.65">and Q is saying it will be glorious and</text>
  <text start="669.67" dur="5.4">by his definition that means bad guys</text>
  <text start="672.13" dur="5.52">dead or suffering so</text>
  <text start="675.07" dur="4.47">when 18 will be glorious and then the</text>
  <text start="677.65" dur="5.36">last thing he says before signing off</text>
  <text start="679.54" dur="8.19">askew is prepare for sky is falling weak</text>

  <text start="2887.29" dur="4.36">there&amp;#39;s a few things I won&amp;#39;t put in the</text>
  <text start="2889.49" dur="5.76">same place because you know like I said</text>
  <text start="2891.65" dur="5.46">that the vitamin D the vitamin k2 the</text>
  <text start="2895.25" dur="5.64">calcium and the magnesium I space those</text>
  <text start="2897.11" dur="5.54">apart but everything else I usually just</text>
  <text start="2900.89" dur="4.59">dump it in the same glass I&amp;#39;m pretty</text>
  <text start="2902.65" dur="7.06">kind of relaxed about it I don&amp;#39;t follow</text>

  <text start="2911.45" dur="5.85">they help each other like I think I Adan</text>

  <text start="2926.49" dur="4.95">so is the the Celtic salt but when I was</text>
  <text start="2929.88" dur="3.12">reading the Celtic salt is a little bit</text>
  <text start="2931.44" dur="2.37">higher in two minerals so that&amp;#39;s why I</text>
  <text start="2933" dur="3.09">went with that one</text>
  <text start="2933.81" dur="4.59">the thing with celtic salt is it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2936.09" dur="4.08">moist salt so the grinders like putting</text>
  <text start="2938.4" dur="3.72">it on your food it&amp;#39;s gonna clam your</text>
  <text start="2940.17" dur="3.54">grinder up so it&amp;#39;s not good for that I</text>
  <text start="2942.12" dur="5.66">just I just put like a quarter spoon in</text>

  <text start="4618.99" dur="4.65">bucks for a year&amp;#39;s supply or more very</text>
  <text start="4621.75" dur="3.96">powerful stuff it works very similarly</text>
  <text start="4623.64" dur="6.57">to hydrogen peroxide it&amp;#39;s an oxidizer</text>
  <text start="4625.71" dur="6.8">and it works in a way that kind of has a</text>

  <text start="4639.27" dur="5.31">sell it but you know the research behind</text>
  <text start="4641.85" dur="4.2">it is pretty darn fascinating they</text>
  <text start="4644.58" dur="2.91">actually had to set up a Church of</text>

  <text start="4669.9" dur="4.7">lot sometimes should I spend a couple</text>
  <text start="4671.64" dur="2.96">minutes talking about that</text>
  <text start="4680.73" dur="17.71">okay that&amp;#39;s a yes all right well this</text>
  <text start="4693.91" dur="6.93">will work so there&amp;#39;s a couple ways of</text>
  <text start="4698.44" dur="6.87">buying silver all right you can get your</text>
  <text start="4700.84" dur="5.91">your nice mint quality like that&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="4705.31" dur="3.12">think somebody gave this to Mira bought</text>
  <text start="4706.75" dur="4.38">it on Craigslist or something I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4708.43" dur="4.77">pay the mint price for this but you can</text>
  <text start="4711.13" dur="4.17">get your your like mint can excuse me</text>
  <text start="4713.2" dur="4.11">your mint coins that are this is more of</text>
  <text start="4715.3" dur="7.14">a collectible or more of like own an</text>
  <text start="4717.31" dur="7.26">example basically and these are usually</text>
  <text start="4722.44" dur="3.93">way more expensive than the spot price</text>
  <text start="4724.57" dur="3.54">of silver of the day like right now the</text>
  <text start="4726.37" dur="3.24">spot price of silver is like 14 and a</text>
  <text start="4728.11" dur="3.84">half this would this would probably be</text>
  <text start="4729.61" dur="5.82">like I don&amp;#39;t know 40 bucks for one of</text>
  <text start="4731.95" dur="5.97">these things you can buy just the the</text>
  <text start="4735.43" dur="4.71">mint coins from the government like the</text>
  <text start="4737.92" dur="5.43">American Eagle or the Canadian Maple</text>
  <text start="4740.14" dur="4.77">Leaf things like that you can usually</text>
  <text start="4743.35" dur="3.12">get those at a little bit higher than</text>
  <text start="4744.91" dur="3.2">spot price couple bucks over because</text>
  <text start="4746.47" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re kind of like the name-brand</text>
  <text start="4748.11" dur="4.69">everybody likes them personally for me</text>
  <text start="4751.33" dur="3.03">if I&amp;#39;m just buying silver I&amp;#39;m cheap</text>
  <text start="4752.8" dur="2.67">about it I just want the silver I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4754.36" dur="5.67">care about where it comes from</text>
  <text start="4755.47" dur="7.25">as long as it&amp;#39;s real so I buy the the</text>
  <text start="4760.03" dur="4.89">and you can get kind of the same 1 ounce</text>
  <text start="4762.72" dur="4.18">coin that&amp;#39;s not the government version</text>
  <text start="4764.92" dur="4.17">but it still point nine nine nine nine</text>
  <text start="4766.9" dur="4.71">percent pure you can get that called a</text>
  <text start="4769.09" dur="4.95">generic round and they come in bars and</text>
  <text start="4771.61" dur="4.47">you can buy the one ounce or the 5 ounce</text>
  <text start="4774.04" dur="4.26">the 10 ounce bars you can just buy the 1</text>
  <text start="4776.08" dur="3.72">ounce coins and those are good options</text>
  <text start="4778.3" dur="2.85">especially if you&amp;#39;re gonna make your own</text>
  <text start="4779.8" dur="4.5">colloidal silver you know you can get</text>
  <text start="4781.15" dur="4.38">you like a 1 ounce 0.999 pure bar and</text>
  <text start="4784.3" dur="3.3">use that for making your own colloidal</text>
  <text start="4785.53" dur="5.01">silver but if you&amp;#39;re trying to get the</text>
  <text start="4787.6" dur="5.94">best deal on silver and you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="4790.54" dur="4.2">pay the lowest premium fee which is kind</text>
  <text start="4793.54" dur="2.49">of high right now anyway because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4794.74" dur="2.94">running out of the physical silver and</text>
  <text start="4796.03" dur="3.12">yes it has to be physical because any</text>
  <text start="4797.68" dur="4.23">paper silver you&amp;#39;re never gonna get it</text>
  <text start="4799.15" dur="5.07">when everything crashes there is not</text>
  <text start="4801.91" dur="4.44">enough physical to meet to not to even</text>
  <text start="4804.22" dur="3.9">meet 1% of the demand of the paper so</text>
  <text start="4806.35" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;re never gonna get it it&amp;#39;s a scam</text>
  <text start="4808.12" dur="4.26">and that&amp;#39;s how they keep pushing the</text>
  <text start="4810.43" dur="3.57">price down of silver like 1913 prices</text>
  <text start="4812.38" dur="3.6">they keep printing more of the paper and</text>
  <text start="4814" dur="3.84">selling it on the market and then</text>
  <text start="4815.98" dur="3.36">driving the price of a physical down but</text>
  <text start="4817.84" dur="2.91">that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a rigged game and</text>
  <text start="4819.34" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s not gonna last much longer</text>
  <text start="4820.75" dur="5.4">so if you want the best deal on silver</text>
  <text start="4823.75" dur="4.5">with the lowest premium that you have to</text>
  <text start="4826.15" dur="4.47">pay as a fee in order to get the</text>
  <text start="4828.25" dur="4.77">physical silver you want to look for</text>
  <text start="4830.62" dur="5.64">something called the 9 the 90% silver</text>
  <text start="4833.02" dur="6.21">junk coins which are the old old US</text>

  <text start="4839.23" dur="4.38">were 90% silver they&amp;#39;re still the US</text>
  <text start="4841.87" dur="3.24">money they&amp;#39;re still legal tender you can</text>
  <text start="4843.61" dur="3.9">still spend them as a dime if you want</text>
  <text start="4845.11" dur="6.39">they come in bags they come in singles</text>
  <text start="4847.51" dur="5.46">whatever but if you get those in a you</text>
  <text start="4851.5" dur="3.69">know hit the fan scenario you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="4852.97" dur="4.32">have the best bartering you know like a</text>

  <text start="4864.25" dur="4.38">they come in these big bags if you buy</text>
  <text start="4865.87" dur="4.74">like like a hundred pound $100 face</text>
  <text start="4868.63" dur="6.05">value bag is like you know about this</text>
  <text start="4870.61" dur="6.03">big it&amp;#39;s about the size of a mug and</text>
  <text start="4874.68" dur="5.89">then you can kind of store it more</text>
  <text start="4876.64" dur="5.37">easily those are really good good value</text>
  <text start="4880.57" dur="3.24">deals everybody has their preference</text>
  <text start="4882.01" dur="3.24">they have like the Ron Paul they have</text>
  <text start="4883.81" dur="3.45">the Trump coins you can pay a little</text>
  <text start="4885.25" dur="3.9">extra for those some coins have color on</text>
  <text start="4887.26" dur="4.68">them if you want to do that that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="4889.15" dur="4.53">but everything I do I try to be</text>
  <text start="4891.94" dur="3.36">efficient about it I try to get the best</text>

  <text start="4902.89" dur="9.45">you&amp;#39;re really looking for the best deal</text>
  <text start="4904.06" dur="10.17">my opinion is the junk coins okay so</text>
  <text start="4912.34" dur="3.87">that that was a kind of an intro to</text>
  <text start="4914.23" dur="8.37">buying silver I think silver is a better</text>

  <text start="5916.51" dur="5.25">carbon 60 kind of went on my radar</text>
  <text start="5919.989" dur="3.57">because of the rat studies that show</text>
  <text start="5921.76" dur="4.56">that it doubled the lifespan of rats so</text>
  <text start="5923.559" dur="5.37">they were testing rats to see what how</text>

  <text start="5930.849" dur="7.59">in oil they gave it to them in olive oil</text>
  <text start="5933.039" dur="6.631">as a suspension and the interesting</text>
  <text start="5938.439" dur="3.33">thing that came of this was that the</text>
  <text start="5939.67" dur="3.96">rats doubled their their normal natural</text>
