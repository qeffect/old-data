  <text start="202.12" dur="3.839">years 50 years old when I finally got</text>
  <text start="203.59" dur="4.53">therapy for it but throughout my naval</text>
  <text start="205.959" dur="5.311">career 32 years I was always pushing</text>
  <text start="208.12" dur="4.86">through being mentally strong and and</text>
  <text start="211.27" dur="3.3">blocking it out is what I did because</text>
  <text start="212.98" dur="2.64">when I happy to see I was having</text>
  <text start="214.57" dur="2.34">nightmares where I didn&amp;#39;t know why</text>
  <text start="215.62" dur="2.49">thought of something to happen my</text>
  <text start="216.91" dur="3.03">childhood but it was something to happen</text>
  <text start="218.11" dur="4.14">when I was in the Navy a lot of people</text>
  <text start="219.94" dur="4.62">are ashamed of it like I said the other</text>
  <text start="222.25" dur="3.66">day it&amp;#39;s almost it&amp;#39;s easier to come out</text>
  <text start="224.56" dur="2.85">and say that you&amp;#39;re gay as opposed to</text>
  <text start="225.91" dur="3.72">saying that you&amp;#39;re PFP to see because</text>
  <text start="227.41" dur="3.6">people have a misconception about PTSD</text>
  <text start="229.63" dur="3.51">they associated with people that are in</text>
  <text start="231.01" dur="3.509">the Korean War Vietnam war they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="233.14" dur="4.26">know that you can like you even the</text>
  <text start="234.519" dur="5.22">Carson it may have PTSD you can get BTC</text>
  <text start="237.4" dur="3.899">being caught in a tornado so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="239.739" dur="3.511">lot of things that go with that people</text>
  <text start="241.299" dur="4.141">hold a man people are afraid to go seek</text>
  <text start="243.25" dur="4.049">help and I was one of those kids I was</text>
  <text start="245.44" dur="4.26">21 years old when I got my PTSD so it</text>
  <text start="247.299" dur="3.69">means me that people are really</text>
  <text start="249.7" dur="2.7">struggling with things and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="250.989" dur="6.361">know what they are they could think that</text>
  <text start="252.4" dur="7.14">it&amp;#39;s a problem yeah causes huge anxiety</text>
  <text start="257.35" dur="4.05">I mean I know I&amp;#39;ve kind of always been a</text>
  <text start="259.54" dur="3.48">little bit aware of things so I saw it</text>
  <text start="261.4" dur="3.12">coming immediately after I got ran over</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="3.48">and then started going through the</text>
  <text start="264.52" dur="4.59">process of learning to ride and as a</text>
  <text start="266.5" dur="4.62">passenger again and it happened to my</text>
  <text start="269.11" dur="3.69">dad as well who actually he got hit by a</text>
  <text start="271.12" dur="3.21">boat while he was out boating talking</text>
  <text start="272.8" dur="3.75">about being on the Navy they were out</text>
  <text start="274.33" dur="4.11">fishing in another boat just full speed</text>
  <text start="276.55" dur="3.51">got him and broke some of his ribs and</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="3.33">he had to swim the buddy of his to shore</text>
  <text start="280.06" dur="3.69">now he won&amp;#39;t drive with people either so</text>
  <text start="281.77" dur="4.44">like that&amp;#39;s just like a fear response</text>
  <text start="283.75" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s very real even though it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.21" dur="3.45">something in the past obviously and we</text>
  <text start="288.04" dur="3.93">know that these things cause all sorts</text>
  <text start="289.66" dur="4.71">of biological reactions and chaos in the</text>
  <text start="291.97" dur="4.47">body and stress and and you know it</text>
  <text start="294.37" dur="3.72">slows down things that would normally be</text>
  <text start="296.44" dur="4.32">functioning when you&amp;#39;re off balance like</text>
  <text start="298.09" dur="3.15">that emotionally so you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="3.11">constant</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="2.63">flight-or-fight response</text>
  <text start="304.9" dur="5.549">that&amp;#39;s exactly what it is and it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="308.02" dur="4.02">I said it&amp;#39;s extremely real and people</text>
  <text start="310.449" dur="2.401">don&amp;#39;t know the root cause of it because</text>
  <text start="312.04" dur="2.52">it could have been something that</text>
  <text start="312.85" dur="3.66">happened to them when they were five or</text>
  <text start="314.56" dur="3.3">six years old but they never dealt with</text>
  <text start="316.51" dur="3.3">it he never got help with it and then</text>
  <text start="317.86" dur="3.54">now they acted out any relationships</text>
  <text start="319.81" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re afraid to go outside the afraid</text>
  <text start="321.4" dur="3.36">went door slam they jump you know</text>
  <text start="323.41" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re afraid of commitment a lot of</text>
  <text start="324.76" dur="3.93">things that&amp;#39;s associated with PTSD yeah</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="5.61">you know I I remember when every single</text>
  <text start="328.69" dur="5.16">I I dated and one girl I had met had</text>
  <text start="332.26" dur="3.99">been raped in the past and she was just</text>
  <text start="333.85" dur="3.96">really cautious if anyone even so much</text>
  <text start="336.25" dur="3.6">as holding hands and that kind of thing</text>
  <text start="337.81" dur="3.81">I mean I was very young at the time but</text>
  <text start="339.85" dur="3.629">I remember that and that sort of thing</text>
  <text start="341.62" dur="3.359">really carries on and these days a lot</text>
  <text start="343.479" dur="3.331">of I mean there&amp;#39;s a whole industry</text>
  <text start="344.979" dur="3.361">around child trafficking and human</text>
  <text start="346.81" dur="4.26">trafficking and people being you know</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="4.98">just turned out through the system and</text>
  <text start="351.07" dur="4.44">destroyed and then you know no one</text>
  <text start="353.32" dur="5.3">really there to help them fix things or</text>
  <text start="355.51" dur="5.72">put a band together afterwards</text>
  <text start="358.62" dur="6.15">turned out and destroyed is a keyword</text>
  <text start="361.23" dur="5.52">you said a lot of people for me when</text>
  <text start="364.77" dur="4.619">when I was molested and raped as a child</text>
  <text start="366.75" dur="4.41">I was turned out and destroyed right and</text>
  <text start="369.389" dur="4.261">so as a child you don&amp;#39;t know the effects</text>
  <text start="371.16" dur="3.99">of it later on I had no idea until I</text>
  <text start="373.65" dur="3.3">started getting into relationships and I</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="3.21">was wondering why I didn&amp;#39;t want a hug I</text>
  <text start="376.95" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t want to hold hands I didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="378.36" dur="4.83">to tell anybody I loved them I was it</text>
  <text start="380.91" dur="3.84">was sometimes it was like you know you</text>
  <text start="383.19" dur="3.51">get this nervous feeling when a woman</text>
  <text start="384.75" dur="3.75">gets too close to you or mail gets too</text>
  <text start="386.7" dur="4.38">close to you because - Annette</text>
  <text start="388.5" dur="4.86">it was my female cousins and my</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="5.55">babysitter for as far as me molester</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="5.73">rate but the male was the male my uncle</text>
  <text start="396.63" dur="4.5">wrote me so it was like the trust factor</text>
  <text start="399.09" dur="4.35">was like zero from a child I didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="401.13" dur="3.539">why until I got older and those things</text>
  <text start="403.44" dur="2.729">started from enough I didn&amp;#39;t know why</text>
  <text start="404.669" dur="3.961">until I got help you know it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="406.169" dur="3.871">thing so yeah it&amp;#39;s turned out in and</text>
  <text start="408.63" dur="2.82">destroys no one should have to go</text>
  <text start="410.04" dur="3.12">through that especially the most</text>
  <text start="411.45" dur="4.17">innocent children who are not ready for</text>
  <text start="413.16" dur="4.2">these kind of things and we have just</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="5.15">not gotten to that point as a culture</text>
  <text start="417.36" dur="3.41">where we&amp;#39;re protecting children</text>
  <text start="420.86" dur="5.17">no that&amp;#39;s another thing that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="423.419" dur="5.161">big that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m so that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m so huge</text>
  <text start="426.03" dur="5.01">on telling my story because look at me</text>
  <text start="428.58" dur="4.35">I&amp;#39;d luckily I&amp;#39;m not supposed to be here</text>
  <text start="431.04" dur="4.02">you know you look at the statistics one</text>
  <text start="432.93" dur="3.66">in three little girls would be raped by</text>
  <text start="435.06" dur="3.87">the age of eight and one in six little</text>
  <text start="436.59" dur="4.11">boys eighty percent of those cases</text>
  <text start="438.93" dur="4.05">eighty percent of those cases go</text>
  <text start="440.7" dur="4.26">unreported so you figure eight missing</text>
  <text start="442.98" dur="5.01">those people that have been migrated or</text>
  <text start="444.96" dur="4.53">molested don&amp;#39;t tell anybody or nobody</text>
  <text start="447.99" dur="2.88">does anything about it and then carrying</text>
  <text start="449.49" dur="3.27">that stuff for that&amp;#39;s why you have these</text>
  <text start="450.87" dur="3.359">serial killers you have your serial</text>
  <text start="452.76" dur="2.94">rapist you have people that lie you have</text>
  <text start="454.229" dur="2.851">people that are afraid to be in</text>
  <text start="455.7" dur="4.14">relationships you have people that are</text>
  <text start="457.08" dur="5.1">afraid to tell the truth so it goes back</text>
  <text start="459.84" dur="4.38">is deeply rooted and we have to open up</text>
  <text start="462.18" dur="2.22">this and talk about more more often than</text>
  <text start="464.22" dur="2.52">not</text>
  <text start="464.4" dur="3.87">along with PTSD because people carry</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="3.36">these things forward and they wound up</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="4.41">acting it out and repeat that again in a</text>
  <text start="470.1" dur="4.379">relationship or friendship or towards a</text>
  <text start="472.68" dur="3.81">can I mean I agree with you completely</text>
  <text start="474.479" dur="3.901">we have to stop making it such a</text>
  <text start="476.49" dur="3.6">shameful topic for people stop trying to</text>
  <text start="478.38" dur="3.78">keep it quiet and sweep it under the rug</text>
  <text start="480.09" dur="4.47">but that&amp;#39;s that is a serious issue and</text>
  <text start="482.16" dur="4.92">this this this problem brings out</text>
  <text start="484.56" dur="4.5">everyone&amp;#39;s skeletons and everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="487.08" dur="3.66">closet I mean everyone&amp;#39;s family has</text>
  <text start="489.06" dur="3.69">probably been touched by this to some</text>
  <text start="490.74" dur="3.54">degree I mean we&amp;#39;ve all known people in</text>
  <text start="492.75" dur="2.669">our you know distant cousins or things</text>
  <text start="494.28" dur="2.91">like that there were just a little bit</text>
  <text start="495.419" dur="3.13">creepy and sometimes it&amp;#39;s more than that</text>
  <text start="497.19" dur="3.469">you know</text>
  <text start="498.549" dur="4.45">everywhere and of course this single</text>
  <text start="500.659" dur="4.47">motherhood issue has been you know not</text>
  <text start="502.999" dur="3.6">directly but you know it has increased</text>
  <text start="505.129" dur="3.78">that because these are father&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="506.599" dur="4.29">aren&amp;#39;t necessarily the the biological</text>
  <text start="508.909" dur="5">father so the statistics are just far</text>
  <text start="510.889" dur="5.941">worse in terms of abuse then</text>
  <text start="513.909" dur="4.57">yeah said sometimes I think these people</text>
  <text start="516.83" dur="3.48">are creepy but they&amp;#39;re not they have</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="3.961">issues that they never dealt with and</text>

  <text start="539.3" dur="5.039">my relationships and I didn&amp;#39;t know why</text>
  <text start="541.25" dur="4.709">the PTSD I had anger issues which which</text>
  <text start="544.339" dur="3.18">coupled with the verbal abuse it was</text>
  <text start="545.959" dur="4.231">like the same thing from being a sexual</text>
  <text start="547.519" dur="4.651">assault to having PTSD to anger issues</text>
  <text start="550.19" dur="4.11">I was always not always but I was mean I</text>

  <text start="554.3" dur="4.979">was a very hurtful man for a long time</text>
  <text start="557.18" dur="3.27">and I just didn&amp;#39;t know why I was like</text>
  <text start="559.279" dur="3.571">that I knew my parents were great</text>
  <text start="560.45" dur="3.93">parents and a lot of you know I studied</text>
  <text start="562.85" dur="3.27">my parents and my mother had a very</text>
  <text start="564.38" dur="3.99">addictive personality my father was very</text>
  <text start="566.12" dur="4.83">extreme but then you couple that with</text>
  <text start="568.37" dur="5.1">the sexual assault and the PTSD it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="570.95" dur="4.56">almost no way out until you decide to</text>
  <text start="573.47" dur="4.89">get help luckily I had a positive</text>
  <text start="575.51" dur="4.65">attitude but and also I knew inside I</text>
  <text start="578.36" dur="3.719">was a good kid because my parents most</text>
  <text start="580.16" dur="3.72">time for the majority time we eat we</text>
  <text start="582.079" dur="3.331">braise the people we as a child you were</text>

  <text start="585.41" dur="3.989">you&amp;#39;re part of your environment but I</text>
  <text start="587.54" dur="2.669">always had that good sense of being a</text>
  <text start="589.399" dur="3.391">good human being</text>
  <text start="590.209" dur="4.5">inside me so that kept me going and then</text>

  <text start="594.709" dur="2.07">always laugh to things he don&amp;#39;t need a</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="2.58">big smile</text>
  <text start="596.779" dur="3.631">so those things helped me balance my</text>
  <text start="598.55" dur="4.14">anger issues out those things helped me</text>
  <text start="600.41" dur="4.739">balance my verbal abuse off because I</text>
  <text start="602.69" dur="5.399">knew then I can fall back on that new</text>
