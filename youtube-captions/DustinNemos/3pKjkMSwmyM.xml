  <text start="88.009" dur="4.081">actually the most exciting breakthrough</text>
  <text start="89.36" dur="7.799">in modern health care or science since</text>
  <text start="92.09" dur="9">antibiotics why early research on carbon</text>
  <text start="97.159" dur="6.811">60 or c64 short has actually shown not</text>
  <text start="101.09" dur="4.65">only a doubling of lifespan and rats but</text>
  <text start="103.97" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;ve seen other interesting studies as</text>

  <text start="158.24" dur="3">crazy headlines that were coming on the</text>
  <text start="159.8" dur="3">other side of the commercials and here</text>
  <text start="161.24" dur="5.01">we go we&amp;#39;re gonna dive right into the</text>
  <text start="162.8" dur="5.19">chemical and bomb threats so we had a 40</text>
  <text start="166.25" dur="4.26">Days for Life and students for life</text>
  <text start="167.99" dur="6.36">kickoff in Rochester Minnesota and it</text>
  <text start="170.51" dur="6.45">was disrupted as someone started to act</text>
  <text start="174.35" dur="5.19">weird and mix chemicals in a bag and</text>
  <text start="176.96" dur="4.53">then leave now an agitated man allegedly</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="4.65">had in his possession what looked to be</text>
  <text start="181.49" dur="5.4">a bomb Maldonado was giving a speech</text>
  <text start="184.19" dur="3.9">entitled embracing controversy at</text>
  <text start="186.89" dur="4.26">Rochester Community and Technical</text>
  <text start="188.09" dur="4.86">College in Rochester Minnesota as police</text>
  <text start="191.15" dur="3.39">were called to the scene now before we</text>
  <text start="192.95" dur="2.07">get into this I don&amp;#39;t think anyone was</text>
  <text start="194.54" dur="2.19">hurt</text>
  <text start="195.02" dur="3.66">I think everyone got out of the building</text>
  <text start="196.73" dur="3.48">people smelled ammonia you can hear my</text>
  <text start="198.68" dur="3.87">little baby in the background Athena</text>
  <text start="200.21" dur="3.36">she&amp;#39;s having breakfast yogurt if you</text>
  <text start="202.55" dur="3.69">haven&amp;#39;t seen the video that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="203.57" dur="4.38">fighting for that it&amp;#39;s really cute one</text>
  <text start="206.24" dur="3.96">of the why we fight videos because this</text>
  <text start="207.95" dur="4.35">is America and we&amp;#39;re losing our country</text>
  <text start="210.2" dur="4.44">to crazy people like this that when a</text>
  <text start="212.3" dur="4.89">bomb and threatened and chemical attack</text>
  <text start="214.64" dur="4.44">people now I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve predicted something</text>
  <text start="217.19" dur="3.99">like this for quite a while and this is</text>
  <text start="219.08" dur="4.44">gonna be this is gonna be weird to hear</text>
  <text start="221.18" dur="4.05">but I believe and I&amp;#39;m not sure about</text>
  <text start="223.52" dur="3.75">this but I believe based on the fact</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="3.57">that they smelled ammonia and I could be</text>
  <text start="227.27" dur="4.11">wrong I&amp;#39;m certainly not an expert on</text>
  <text start="228.8" dur="4.23">bombs but the fact that they smelled</text>
  <text start="231.38" dur="4.95">ammonia could mean that they were trying</text>
  <text start="233.03" dur="7.23">to mix a bag or a book bag of mustard</text>
  <text start="236.33" dur="5.91">gas right in the middle of students now</text>
  <text start="240.26" dur="6.03">the reason that I say this is because</text>
  <text start="242.24" dur="5.67">one we had no explosives - at least that</text>
  <text start="246.29" dur="3.24">we know of an ammonia could probably be</text>
  <text start="247.91" dur="3.84">used for explosives - I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="249.53" dur="3.75">not an expert on this but what I do know</text>
  <text start="251.75" dur="3.03">and I&amp;#39;ve heard about this before because</text>
  <text start="253.28" dur="3.329">I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of research on chemical</text>
  <text start="254.78" dur="3.209">warfare I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of research on</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="2.88">history and I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of research</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="2.671">on you know world war two things like</text>
  <text start="259.489" dur="3.091">that what were one just all these</text>
  <text start="260.66" dur="3.78">different situations start history and</text>
  <text start="262.58" dur="3.99">you know these are the sort of things</text>
  <text start="264.44" dur="4.32">that are normally reserved for for</text>
  <text start="266.57" dur="5.94">warfare and in the field of fight</text>
  <text start="268.76" dur="5.91">necessarily but also banned for for many</text>
  <text start="272.51" dur="3.9">you know instances of warfare so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="274.67" dur="4.23">even think mustard gas is legal by our</text>
  <text start="276.41" dur="4.77">modern ethical war standards whatever</text>
  <text start="278.9" dur="4.47">that means I&amp;#39;m you all&amp;#39;s fair in love</text>
  <text start="281.18" dur="3.36">and war they say and usually the</text>
  <text start="283.37" dur="2.31">government&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t actually honor those</text>
  <text start="284.54" dur="2.52">things anyway we know that they</text>
  <text start="285.68" dur="2.88">experiment with chemical weapons we know</text>
  <text start="287.06" dur="3.06">that the experiment with viral weapons</text>
  <text start="288.56" dur="3.06">we know that they can target species</text>
  <text start="290.12" dur="4.47">down to their genome now</text>
  <text start="291.62" dur="5.88">or a race of people like white or black</text>
  <text start="294.59" dur="4.74">or Asian or you know Jew or Muslim or</text>
  <text start="297.5" dur="4.65">whatever else it may be that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="299.33" dur="4.86">possible now but I I immediately go to</text>
  <text start="302.15" dur="3.75">the simplest answer which is Occam&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.19" dur="4.199">razor always the simplest explanations</text>
  <text start="305.9" dur="5.22">the best and in this case my immediate</text>
  <text start="308.389" dur="4.081">fear if I had been me in that room with</text>
  <text start="311.12" dur="3.21">my family there trying to learn</text>
  <text start="312.47" dur="3.18">something about the pro life or whatever</text>
  <text start="314.33" dur="3.24">it may be that they were talking about</text>
  <text start="315.65" dur="3.51">at the time if that had been me and I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="317.57" dur="2.849">smelled ammonia I would have bolted in</text>
  <text start="319.16" dur="4.02">the other direction because you have</text>
  <text start="320.419" dur="4.771">about ten seconds before you drown you</text>
  <text start="323.18" dur="4.14">pass out you see white spots you pass</text>
  <text start="325.19" dur="4.19">out in your own lung fluid and you drown</text>
  <text start="327.32" dur="5.31">because your lungs have literally melt</text>
  <text start="329.38" dur="6.97">that is what mustard gas does to people</text>
  <text start="332.63" dur="5.37">now beyond that it&amp;#39;s a two ingredient</text>
  <text start="336.35" dur="3.24">combination one of which is ammonia</text>
  <text start="338" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re all available in grocery stores</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="3.63">and I really don&amp;#39;t recommend people</text>
  <text start="341.36" dur="3.99">trying to do this people often diamond</text>
  <text start="343.22" dur="5.97">the housewives often die or maybe not</text>
  <text start="345.35" dur="5.49">often but but semi-regularly die because</text>
  <text start="349.19" dur="3.9">they mix these chemicals to try to make</text>
  <text start="350.84" dur="4.02">a super cleaner at home now this is the</text>
  <text start="353.09" dur="3.81">kind of stuff any crazy moron from</text>
  <text start="354.86" dur="4.29">Antigua could learn about and go out and</text>
  <text start="356.9" dur="4.23">try to do now I&amp;#39;ve even predicted things</text>
  <text start="359.15" dur="3.51">like this I&amp;#39;ve talked about what happens</text>
  <text start="361.13" dur="3.32">when they learn how to do simple mustard</text>
  <text start="362.66" dur="6.06">gas and they disperse it into a crowd</text>
  <text start="364.45" dur="6.969">this is frightening fortunately no one</text>
  <text start="368.72" dur="3.96">was hurt on this instance but but the</text>
  <text start="371.419" dur="2.551">alternative could have been very</text>
  <text start="372.68" dur="4.049">different the alternative could have</text>
  <text start="373.97" dur="5.85">been 40 dead in a room drowned in their</text>
  <text start="376.729" dur="4.531">own fluids and and that would have been</text>
  <text start="379.82" dur="3.569">it they would have aired out the doors</text>
  <text start="381.26" dur="5.79">called in a hazmat team figured it out</text>
  <text start="383.389" dur="5.31">and we would have been too late so</text>
  <text start="387.05" dur="3.51">fortunately look everyone was out</text>
  <text start="388.699" dur="3.84">quickly but if you are ever in one of</text>
  <text start="390.56" dur="4.74">these events and you smell ammonia or</text>
  <text start="392.539" dur="4.261">other harsh can the holes please get out</text>
  <text start="395.3" dur="3.149">of there please just hold your breath</text>
  <text start="396.8" dur="3.119">run the other way don&amp;#39;t let it fix when</text>
  <text start="398.449" dur="3.621">you don&amp;#39;t expose your children to it it</text>
  <text start="399.919" dur="4.171">can cause lifelong damage to your lungs</text>
  <text start="402.07" dur="4.779">the only time I&amp;#39;ve ever heard of a</text>
  <text start="404.09" dur="4.65">positive example of this is one kind a</text>
  <text start="406.849" dur="4.32">guy was exposed to just a seconds with</text>
  <text start="408.74" dur="4.649">just a second whiff and he had been</text>
  <text start="411.169" dur="3.841">smoking for like 50 years or something I</text>
  <text start="413.389" dur="4.351">don&amp;#39;t remember but his lungs were very</text>
  <text start="415.01" dur="5.55">very tarred afterwards his lungs came</text>
  <text start="417.74" dur="6.06">out pink and clean because they had</text>
  <text start="420.56" dur="4.27">scrubbed out and burnt out the outer</text>
  <text start="423.8" dur="2.799">layer</text>
  <text start="424.83" dur="3.57">and his his lungs actually did well and</text>
  <text start="426.599" dur="3.241">healed from it but that&amp;#39;s not something</text>
  <text start="428.4" dur="2.34">I would recommend at home I mean this is</text>
  <text start="429.84" dur="3.75">a death sentence</text>
  <text start="430.74" dur="5.1">a painful miserable death sentence</text>
  <text start="433.59" dur="4.47">continuing on and this is far worse than</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="3.449">the what was he at the the acid attacks</text>
  <text start="438.06" dur="3.15">on the deplorable that they were</text>
  <text start="439.289" dur="3.361">planning to do that would have been bad</text>
  <text start="441.21" dur="3.389">that would have caused a stampede that</text>
  <text start="442.65" dur="4.049">would have caused irritation everything</text>
  <text start="444.599" dur="3.901">else lung irritation people could have</text>
  <text start="446.699" dur="3.541">been killed in a stampede people have</text>
  <text start="448.5" dur="5.419">been killed in stampedes in this country</text>
  <text start="450.24" dur="6.51">before for things like Black Friday but</text>
  <text start="453.919" dur="4.481">this is a little bit worse this is an</text>
  <text start="456.75" dur="3">attempt to mass murder people with it</text>
  <text start="458.4" dur="4.019">with a chemical weapon of mass</text>
  <text start="459.75" dur="6.03">destruction and I&amp;#39;m just happy no one</text>
  <text start="462.419" dur="5.881">was hurt so we also have another video</text>
  <text start="465.78" dur="4.289">of I hate to laugh immediately after</text>
  <text start="468.3" dur="3.899">such a dark topic but this one&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="470.069" dur="4.5">funny Justin Trudeau has actually been</text>
  <text start="472.199" dur="4.141">caught in three different instances of</text>
  <text start="474.569" dur="3.81">dressing up in blackface</text>
  <text start="476.34" dur="4.35">and it wasn&amp;#39;t just blackface folks I</text>
  <text start="478.379" dur="3.66">mean he went the full costume he acting</text>
  <text start="480.69" dur="3.12">and people were pointing this out on</text>

  <text start="504.81" dur="3.509">about this stuff as much I mean people</text>

  <text start="597.809" dur="4.32">people from even heading up here in the</text>

  <text start="616.369" dur="4.96">basically just a walk and they get help</text>
  <text start="619.529" dur="3.42">with trucks and stuff to shore but we</text>

  <text start="640.379" dur="4.11">want to come here because they were</text>
  <text start="641.999" dur="4.08">promised a bunch of free things and when</text>
  <text start="644.489" dur="4.051">they get here oftentimes either that</text>
  <text start="646.079" dur="3.93">doesn&amp;#39;t pan out or they actually do end</text>

  <text start="654.299" dur="4.44">never contribute to enough to</text>
  <text start="656.579" dur="4.29">recompensate and it&amp;#39;s a fancy word of</text>
  <text start="658.739" dur="4.5">saying there muches and most of them</text>
  <text start="660.869" dur="4.68">will always be a mooch and it&amp;#39;s if you</text>
  <text start="663.239" dur="5.22">as if you invited a mooch into your home</text>
  <text start="665.549" dur="5.13">trust me I&amp;#39;ve had my brothers won so</text>
  <text start="668.459" dur="4.201">I&amp;#39;ve had him live with me before he was</text>
  <text start="670.679" dur="3.33">ruined by my mother who who got him into</text>
  <text start="672.66" dur="2.94">you know the same stuff that same</text>
  <text start="674.009" dur="4.02">lifestyle and drugs everything else</text>
  <text start="675.6" dur="4.229">never had any work ethic so he he sits</text>
  <text start="678.029" dur="3.81">around and mooches off of either my</text>
  <text start="679.829" dur="3.391">mother or his girlfriends or whoever</text>
  <text start="681.839" dur="5.401">he&amp;#39;s with at the time even had a wife</text>
  <text start="683.22" dur="6.479">once and he moved off her so this is</text>
  <text start="687.24" dur="4.529">what happens you can&amp;#39;t afford a mooch</text>
  <text start="689.699" dur="3.3">and if you can&amp;#39;t afford a mooch and</text>
  <text start="691.769" dur="3.06">you&amp;#39;re fortunate enough that you can</text>
  <text start="692.999" dur="3.421">actually take care of a human being</text>
  <text start="694.829" dur="4.38">their entire lives because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="696.42" dur="4.8">productive then the next mooch will</text>
  <text start="699.209" dur="3.271">break you or the one after that or the</text>
  <text start="701.22" dur="2.63">one after that it&amp;#39;s eventually it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="702.48" dur="3.18">numbers game if you leave your door open</text>
  <text start="703.85" dur="4.029">people will eventually eat you out of</text>
  <text start="705.66" dur="4.2">house and home that&amp;#39;s why we have doors</text>
  <text start="707.879" dur="4.86">with locks and things for safety for</text>
  <text start="709.86" dur="5.37">protection for division of your interest</text>
  <text start="712.739" dur="6.27">for my interests so that people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="715.23" dur="5.43">walk in and walk over you and and you</text>
  <text start="719.009" dur="3.3">know we all have we all have wants and</text>
  <text start="720.66" dur="3.719">desires and needs and resources are</text>
  <text start="722.309" dur="4.13">scarce and finite and everyone wants</text>
  <text start="724.379" dur="5.31">them the difference is that some people</text>
  <text start="726.439" dur="5.471">bring value to others for that they earn</text>
  <text start="729.689" dur="4.171">the resources in a win-win capitalist</text>
  <text start="731.91" dur="4.049">way and that some people will actually</text>
  <text start="733.86" dur="2.939">go the other way and they&amp;#39;ll just take</text>
  <text start="735.959" dur="2.25">take take</text>
  <text start="736.799" dur="2.82">they don&amp;#39;t really feel that guilty about</text>
  <text start="738.209" dur="3.12">it after a while because they get used</text>
  <text start="739.619" dur="4.291">to it and they that&amp;#39;s their way in life</text>
  <text start="741.329" dur="5.31">and those people have chosen the path of</text>
  <text start="743.91" dur="4.56">the parasite so what happens well I</text>
  <text start="746.639" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t let my brother mooch off of me I</text>
  <text start="748.47" dur="4.289">kicked him out it was not easy but I</text>
  <text start="750.839" dur="5.04">kicked him out and I actually moved away</text>
  <text start="752.759" dur="4.74">to kick him out and what happened I</text>
  <text start="755.879" dur="4.32">moved right back in with someone else</text>
  <text start="757.499" dur="3.84">and he&amp;#39;s mooching off of them but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="760.199" dur="3.721">not mooching off of me</text>
  <text start="761.339" dur="4.62">so that&amp;#39;s what happens with people like</text>
  <text start="763.92" dur="4.5">this you have to close the door you have</text>
  <text start="765.959" dur="4.35">to close the border otherwise you will</text>
  <text start="768.42" dur="4.44">be overwhelmed and whether or not</text>
  <text start="770.309" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re good bad indifferent ugly</text>
  <text start="772.86" dur="4.529">they&amp;#39;re willing to steal resources from</text>
  <text start="774.929" dur="4.35">you clearly and you were running out so</text>
  <text start="777.389" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s exactly the problem at the end of</text>
  <text start="779.279" dur="4.29">the day now not to mention the fact that</text>
  <text start="781.199" dur="4.26">many of them are openly willing to not</text>
  <text start="783.569" dur="3.541">only steal resources but commit crime to</text>
  <text start="785.459" dur="3.66">do so I mean just like violating our</text>
  <text start="787.11" dur="4.259">laws to come here illegally through some</text>
  <text start="789.119" dur="4.56">sort of back way that&amp;#39;s not the official</text>

  <text start="842.67" dur="6.81">so cute it&amp;#39;s like a little little human</text>
  <text start="845.149" dur="6.94">but anyway continuing on this imagine if</text>
  <text start="849.48" dur="5.219">this crowd were heading to your home or</text>
  <text start="852.089" dur="5.22">your small community or your you know</text>
  <text start="854.699" dur="4.98">whatever right how much is too much at</text>
  <text start="857.309" dur="4.051">one point do you have to say I have to</text>

  <text start="864.569" dur="5.58">I can&amp;#39;t feed my own children well this</text>
  <text start="866.85" dur="5.88">is exactly the flood it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="870.149" dur="4.47">the proverbial flood in a sense because</text>
  <text start="872.73" dur="4.199">it&amp;#39;s never going to stop it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="874.619" dur="4.53">continue and continue pouring into your</text>
  <text start="876.929" dur="4.38">home into your door until you shut the</text>
  <text start="879.149" dur="3.87">door now that&amp;#39;s a decision that we have</text>
  <text start="881.309" dur="3.301">to make as a society because we have</text>
  <text start="883.019" dur="3.3">this sort of a collective mentality and</text>
  <text start="884.61" dur="3.209">any government does things for us</text>
  <text start="886.319" dur="3.45">instead of us allowing you know to</text>
  <text start="887.819" dur="3.27">protect our own property it was even a</text>
  <text start="889.769" dur="2.79">very simple thing in a capitalist</text>
  <text start="891.089" dur="3.21">society would shoot everyone that</text>
  <text start="892.559" dur="3.661">trespass and stole from us until they</text>
  <text start="894.299" dur="3.421">quit and everyone along the border would</text>
  <text start="896.22" dur="3.599">have a bunch of guns and year or two</text>
  <text start="897.72" dur="4.109">later this problem would stop they would</text>
  <text start="899.819" dur="3.27">have all been stopped they would have</text>
  <text start="901.829" dur="3.24">come through said hey there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="903.089" dur="3.18">free some of them would have left many</text>
  <text start="905.069" dur="2.49">of them would have stayed and started to</text>
  <text start="906.269" dur="2.94">steal and those people would have been</text>
  <text start="907.559" dur="3.301">shot obviously I&amp;#39;m not saying line them</text>

  <text start="1058.26" dur="5.73">but here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s being said one it</text>
  <text start="1062.279" dur="3.301">appears that an American spy in one of</text>
  <text start="1063.99" dur="4.799">our intelligence agencies may have been</text>
  <text start="1065.58" dur="5.28">spying on our own president this agent</text>

  <text start="1070.86" dur="3.09">employee in the government hierarchy</text>
  <text start="1072.419" dur="3.87">apparently believes that it is his or</text>
  <text start="1073.95" dur="3.839">her job to second-guess the motivation</text>
  <text start="1076.289" dur="4.14">behind the words of the elected</text>
  <text start="1077.789" dur="4.461">president who&amp;#39;s the most superior</text>
  <text start="1080.429" dur="3.99">officer of the whole country by the way</text>
  <text start="1082.25" dur="5.02">article 2 of the Constitution gives the</text>

  <text start="1101.52" dur="4.48">basically what this means brother is</text>
  <text start="1103.96" dur="4.59">that you don&amp;#39;t get to pick the way the</text>
  <text start="1106" dur="3.96">country is ran unless you&amp;#39;re elected as</text>
  <text start="1108.55" dur="3.42">president just because you don&amp;#39;t agree</text>
  <text start="1109.96" dur="3.599">with the way it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s being done just</text>
  <text start="1111.97" dur="4.47">because you don&amp;#39;t like a Republican or</text>
  <text start="1113.559" dur="4.411">over a conservative I mean I would not</text>
  <text start="1116.44" dur="3.06">say the President Trump is a typical</text>
  <text start="1117.97" dur="3.51">Republican remember he used to be a</text>
  <text start="1119.5" dur="3.57">Democrat he&amp;#39;s not your average</text>
  <text start="1121.48" dur="3.42">Republican but just because you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1123.07" dur="4.14">like the way someone thinks or whatever</text>
  <text start="1124.9" dur="4.5">doesn&amp;#39;t mean you get to pick okay all</text>
  <text start="1127.21" dur="4.08">too often you see that the dumbest among</text>
  <text start="1129.4" dur="4.11">us with the most confidence and things</text>
  <text start="1131.29" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s because they cannot find a</text>
  <text start="1133.51" dur="3.39">hundred different ways things could go</text>
  <text start="1135.28" dur="3.149">they can imagine one or two outcomes</text>
  <text start="1136.9" dur="3.39">where they&amp;#39;re always right you know</text>
  <text start="1138.429" dur="4.411">stupid people have high confidence for</text>
  <text start="1140.29" dur="4.38">that reason you&amp;#39;ll find that among</text>
  <text start="1142.84" dur="3.06">intelligent people there&amp;#39;s often a</text>
  <text start="1144.67" dur="2.37">little bit less confidence sometimes</text>
  <text start="1145.9" dur="3.24">even to the point where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1147.04" dur="4.23">uncertain because they can see so many</text>
  <text start="1149.14" dur="4.289">things that could go wrong or so they</text>
  <text start="1151.27" dur="3.9">see so many possible variations of the</text>
  <text start="1153.429" dur="4.081">future so many threads that could that</text>
  <text start="1155.17" dur="4.05">could happen and I&amp;#39;ll tell you it can</text>
  <text start="1157.51" dur="3.09">not it cannot be fun you know sometimes</text>
  <text start="1159.22" dur="3.72">because you can&amp;#39;t tell what may happen</text>
  <text start="1160.6" dur="5.37">and ignorance is bliss because those</text>
  <text start="1162.94" dur="4.8">those blissfully ignorant and confident</text>
  <text start="1165.97" dur="3.81">people are always so certain of their</text>
  <text start="1167.74" dur="3.81">opinions and that&amp;#39;s what happens a lot</text>
  <text start="1169.78" dur="4.26">with the left you have this over</text>
  <text start="1171.55" dur="4.71">educated but you know an intelligent</text>
  <text start="1174.04" dur="5.28">class of people who have for the most</text>
  <text start="1176.26" dur="5.82">part lower IQ now you know we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1179.32" dur="4.26">the briefly why did that happen because</text>
  <text start="1182.08" dur="2.91">they took over the education system they</text>
  <text start="1183.58" dur="3.81">took a role of positions of power and</text>
  <text start="1184.99" dur="4.5">they started to just drive down the</text>
  <text start="1187.39" dur="3.99">standards of the you know for exact ala</text>
  <text start="1189.49" dur="3.27">jej occation system until they could</text>
  <text start="1191.38" dur="3.66">bring in as many students as possible</text>
  <text start="1192.76" dur="3.57">now what happens when you stop picking</text>
  <text start="1195.04" dur="2.97">the intelligent you start bringing in</text>
  <text start="1196.33" dur="3.72">the masses you drive down the standards</text>
  <text start="1198.01" dur="3.9">now college is for stupid people and</text>
  <text start="1200.05" dur="3.96">anyone can pass and it doesn&amp;#39;t help you</text>
  <text start="1201.91" dur="4.14">much to have a college degree outside of</text>
  <text start="1204.01" dur="4.29">the STEM fields so you know it for</text>
  <text start="1206.05" dur="4.379">example I you know guys I&amp;#39;m a high</text>
  <text start="1208.3" dur="4.08">school dropout and in fact I&amp;#39;m I never</text>
  <text start="1210.429" dur="4.591">went to college outside of a course for</text>
  <text start="1212.38" dur="4.92">for actually of all things I took some</text>
  <text start="1215.02" dur="5.28">bodywork course a massage course to had</text>
  <text start="1217.3" dur="4.56">a Hill people naturally and how to help</text>
  <text start="1220.3" dur="4.41">with alleviating pain and things of that</text>
  <text start="1221.86" dur="3.66">nature with with you know a hands-on</text>
  <text start="1224.71" dur="2.97">modality</text>
  <text start="1225.52" dur="3.81">healing modality and some there&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1227.68" dur="3.09">Swedish relaxation massage and such a</text>
  <text start="1229.33" dur="3.66">mystical in the school too but I</text>
  <text start="1230.77" dur="4.02">actually did a massage class for that</text>
  <text start="1232.99" dur="4.29">reason because I didn&amp;#39;t want to go into</text>
  <text start="1234.79" dur="3.84">a traditional sort of medical field at</text>
  <text start="1237.28" dur="4.38">one point I thought about being a brain</text>
  <text start="1238.63" dur="4.83">surgeon right but it just it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1241.66" dur="3.54">appeal to me and I wanted to help people</text>
  <text start="1243.46" dur="4.02">in a way that had sort of the the</text>
  <text start="1245.2" dur="4.92">non-toxic connotations so I went to went</text>
  <text start="1247.48" dur="4.14">to school for a year did a class passed</text>
  <text start="1250.12" dur="4.23">everything did it all great then I got</text>
  <text start="1251.62" dur="3.93">ran over and was never actually able to</text>
  <text start="1254.35" dur="4.02">do anything with that career which is</text>
  <text start="1255.55" dur="5.22">which is fine it was it wasn&amp;#39;t a great</text>
  <text start="1258.37" dur="4.05">class it&amp;#39;s a lot of fun lie down I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1260.77" dur="4.68">a massage therapist I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="1262.42" dur="5.13">help people with pain and you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1265.45" dur="3.21">known a lot of them that have had a lot</text>
  <text start="1267.55" dur="2.58">of pain and they always go to the</text>
  <text start="1268.66" dur="3.81">doctors and they deal with these these</text>
  <text start="1270.13" dur="4.11">drugs they deal with these these cut</text>
  <text start="1272.47" dur="3.39">poison burn strategies and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1274.24" dur="4.34">it&amp;#39;s not a great place to see people</text>
  <text start="1275.86" dur="6.69">anyway I&amp;#39;m always on these uh these uh</text>
  <text start="1278.58" dur="7.87">rants and and digressions so back to the</text>
  <text start="1282.55" dur="5.55">point here we also have the icwp a law</text>
  <text start="1286.45" dur="3.81">defining the parameters of an urgent</text>
  <text start="1288.1" dur="4.29">concern complaint as an abuse or</text>

  <text start="1298.12" dur="4.94">include differences of opinion</text>
  <text start="1299.56" dur="6.18">concerning public policy matters so</text>
  <text start="1303.06" dur="6.25">basically this is not an intelligence</text>
  <text start="1305.74" dur="4.56">thing this is a presidential area that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1309.31" dur="2.34">not even part of the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1310.3" dur="2.94">community but they&amp;#39;re trying to call it</text>
  <text start="1311.65" dur="3.84">a whistleblower because they know</text>
  <text start="1313.24" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re spying is about to come out and</text>
  <text start="1315.49" dur="3.93">they know they have to frame it</text>
  <text start="1317.47" dur="4.1">correctly because whistleblower sounds a</text>
  <text start="1319.42" dur="5.4">whole lot better than FISA abuse</text>
  <text start="1321.57" dur="6.67">constitutional crisis spying in treason</text>
  <text start="1324.82" dur="5.52">right we also have the Director of</text>
  <text start="1328.24" dur="3.72">National Intelligence DNI agrees with</text>
  <text start="1330.34" dur="3">this assessment his agencies general</text>

  <text start="1337.84" dur="4.02">quote from someone outside the Intel</text>
  <text start="1340.3" dur="4.26">community and did not relate to</text>
  <text start="1341.86" dur="5.37">intelligence activity so you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1344.56" dur="4.38">getting more and more and more and Trump</text>
  <text start="1347.23" dur="3.27">said it&amp;#39;s ridiculous it&amp;#39;s just another</text>

  <text start="2591.18" dur="3.93">realization of people that these false</text>

  <text start="2624.15" dur="3.51">projection that they do and like I said</text>
  <text start="2625.86" dur="2.94">the best thing that&amp;#39;s happened is the</text>
  <text start="2627.66" dur="3.3">fact that it&amp;#39;s not working anymore</text>
  <text start="2628.8" dur="3.9">people are aware of those things they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="2642.54" dur="4.44">the great awakening now last but not</text>
  <text start="2644.97" dur="4.1">least I want to mention this Donald</text>

  <text start="2665" dur="3.63">through the concrete that doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>

  <text start="2687.53" dur="3.06">I don&amp;#39;t remember if they were friends or</text>
  <text start="2688.52" dur="3.72">enemies but they asked one of the</text>

  <text start="2702.83" dur="6.51">is why does your city have no walls and</text>
  <text start="2705.41" dur="6.45">the response was basically an in classic</text>
  <text start="2709.34" dur="4.73">laconic phrase you know if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2711.86" dur="5.72">heard of a laconic phrase check it out</text>
  <text start="2714.07" dur="7.39">he basically said that a wall of men is</text>
  <text start="2717.58" dur="5.71">the best wall for city in defense and I</text>
  <text start="2721.46" dur="4.17">absolutely agree with that like you can</text>
  <text start="2723.29" dur="4.59">build it to a 20-foot thick wall 100</text>
  <text start="2725.63" dur="4.11">feet high like the wall from the game of</text>

  <text start="2744.23" dur="2.58">everything out and they take over the</text>
  <text start="2745.52" dur="4.53">wall and they just win right</text>
  <text start="2746.81" dur="6.9">that&amp;#39;s exactly exactly the same kind of</text>
