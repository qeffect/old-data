  <text start="3.03" dur="4.14">mouse of Apex health club my health</text>
  <text start="5.4" dur="4.59">website where you&amp;#39;re gonna get the best</text>
  <text start="7.17" dur="4.77">information on health you know and I try</text>
  <text start="9.99" dur="3.18">to do things for free I mean mainly I</text>
  <text start="11.94" dur="3.6">got into this to give away information</text>
  <text start="13.17" dur="3.72">for free so it&amp;#39;s worth it to go there</text>
  <text start="15.54" dur="4.17">even if you don&amp;#39;t want to buy anything</text>
  <text start="16.89" dur="5.28">and I definitely encourage that now this</text>
  <text start="19.71" dur="4.44">is going to be a quick video about</text>
  <text start="22.17" dur="4.619">mainly the carbon 60 thing I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="24.15" dur="4.26">getting a lot of questions about that a</text>
  <text start="26.789" dur="4.32">lot of repeat questions you know how</text>
  <text start="28.41" dur="4.829">much to take that kind of thing how do</text>
  <text start="31.109" dur="3.991">you take it the basic questions I do</text>
  <text start="33.239" dur="4.081">send out some flyers with this stuff</text>
  <text start="35.1" dur="5.16">just some basic information but you know</text>
  <text start="37.32" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s a terrible health company I mean we</text>
  <text start="40.26" dur="4.02">have great products but let&amp;#39;s be honest</text>
  <text start="42.54" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;ve been so busy with the media side of</text>
  <text start="44.28" dur="4.47">things that sometimes my orders are a</text>
  <text start="47.1" dur="3.029">little bit late like you with the move</text>
  <text start="48.75" dur="3.629">and everything I&amp;#39;ve had some pretty late</text>
  <text start="50.129" dur="3.57">orders and sent out you know discounts</text>
  <text start="52.379" dur="3.721">and apologies and everything and I</text>
  <text start="53.699" dur="4.891">really hate to do that so part of what I</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="4.95">want to do is ramp up the quality side</text>
  <text start="58.59" dur="4.32">of the customer support and and and</text>
  <text start="61.05" dur="4.02">you&amp;#39;ll be able to to get a more</text>
  <text start="62.91" dur="4.11">streamlined process and more products I</text>
  <text start="65.07" dur="4.229">haven&amp;#39;t even added products for months</text>
  <text start="67.02" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to even though we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="69.299" dur="3.631">probably helped to fund the show better</text>
  <text start="70.92" dur="4.41">I just haven&amp;#39;t at the time so where we</text>
  <text start="72.93" dur="4.2">are with the c60 a couple of the the</text>
  <text start="75.33" dur="5.219">common things that people are gonna want</text>
  <text start="77.13" dur="5.79">to know how much do people take first of</text>
  <text start="80.549" dur="4.621">all this is an experimental new thing I</text>
  <text start="82.92" dur="3.78">mean yes it&amp;#39;s just a carbon and you can</text>
  <text start="85.17" dur="3.089">see kind of what it&amp;#39;s shaped like right</text>
  <text start="86.7" dur="3.48">there on the screen this is a sort of a</text>
  <text start="88.259" dur="4.5">soccer ball shaped carbon and everything</text>
  <text start="90.18" dur="4.229">is made out of carbon and the rat study</text>
  <text start="92.759" dur="3.961">where they were trying to kill the rats</text>
  <text start="94.409" dur="3.6">with a toxicity study well they made</text>
  <text start="96.72" dur="3.45">them live twice as long the head</text>
  <text start="98.009" dur="4.32">researcher said safe at high levels over</text>
  <text start="100.17" dur="4.17">long periods of time so it is</text>
  <text start="102.329" dur="4.171">experimental but based on that and the</text>
  <text start="104.34" dur="4.8">other decades of research behind this</text>
  <text start="106.5" dur="5.28">you can probably safely surmise based on</text>
  <text start="109.14" dur="4.799">your own research that taking it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="111.78" dur="3.93">gonna cause you in harm you know make</text>
  <text start="113.939" dur="8.911">your own decisions about that of course</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="9.689">I take quite a bit if it&amp;#39;s well I use it</text>
  <text start="122.85" dur="4.379">actually I even use it for like lotion</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="3.601">and and my cuticles are always in really</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="3.09">rough shape so that my fingers are dried</text>
  <text start="129" dur="3.66">out and they heard me at scars</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="2.701">everywhere this helps me with that this</text>
  <text start="132.66" dur="2.79">helps</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="4.86">with that coconut oil aspect which I</text>
  <text start="135.45" dur="4.38">prefer for the lotion is even more</text>
  <text start="137.88" dur="3.09">benefit for your skin I think all of</text>
  <text start="139.83" dur="3.99">this a little bit harder for me at least</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="6.87">to absorb leaves me kind of greasy so I</text>
  <text start="143.82" dur="8.99">just eat the olive but so that kind of</text>
  <text start="147.84" dur="7.47">covers your one of the questions now</text>
  <text start="152.81" dur="4.63">we&amp;#39;re going about dosing and everything</text>
  <text start="155.31" dur="3.81">else I&amp;#39;m sorry that kind of covers that</text>
  <text start="157.44" dur="4.95">the liability in the disclaimer part</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="4.89">when we&amp;#39;re going about dosing first I</text>
  <text start="162.39" dur="2.91">prefer to use the word portion I mean</text>
  <text start="164.01" dur="4.71">really what we&amp;#39;re dealing with is food</text>
  <text start="165.3" dur="5.37">based items here coconut oil and carbon</text>
  <text start="168.72" dur="4.98">I mean it doesn&amp;#39;t get any more natural</text>
  <text start="170.67" dur="4.8">and basic than that it kind of very</text>
  <text start="173.7" dur="4.32">similar to sort of activated charcoal</text>
  <text start="175.47" dur="4.44">but don&amp;#39;t buy activated charcoal from</text>
  <text start="178.02" dur="3.99">from people out there like David avocado</text>
  <text start="179.91" dur="3.54">Wolfe whom who may or may not innocently</text>
  <text start="182.01" dur="3.51">I don&amp;#39;t know if he believes that c60 or</text>
  <text start="183.45" dur="4.98">not but is selling activated charcoal a</text>
  <text start="185.52" dur="5.1">c60 and that is a scam trust me I mean</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="2.88">it&amp;#39;s good for you but it&amp;#39;s not c60 good</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="2.1">for you</text>
  <text start="191.31" dur="4.5">and it&amp;#39;s not worth those kind of prices</text>
  <text start="192.72" dur="5.55">you just want bacon you little beggar</text>
  <text start="195.81" dur="4.67">so that&amp;#39;s kind of where we are there in</text>
  <text start="198.27" dur="4.41">terms of how much to take portion wise</text>
  <text start="200.48" dur="4.87">most people that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ll you know</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="4.8">most people including myself half a</text>
  <text start="205.35" dur="4.62">teaspoon to two teaspoons depending on</text>
  <text start="207.48" dur="4.02">where you are personally in terms of</text>
  <text start="209.97" dur="3">budget because this stuff is little</text>
  <text start="211.5" dur="3.63">expensive now I&amp;#39;m thinking it&amp;#39;s gonna go</text>
  <text start="212.97" dur="4.65">down soon we&amp;#39;re getting there to that</text>
  <text start="215.13" dur="4.59">point the markets catching up but we</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="4.65">were sold out for months I couldn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="219.72" dur="4.17">keep it in and I&amp;#39;m fairly well-connected</text>
  <text start="222.27" dur="3.72">me I couldn&amp;#39;t keep it in for months</text>
  <text start="223.89" dur="4.59">people were waiting and waiting so I</text>
  <text start="225.99" dur="4.02">haven&amp;#39;t really ever marketed c60 much</text>
  <text start="228.48" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;ve mentioned it on my channel a few</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="5.85">times it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s helping to fund the</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="5.37">show but you know we want to actually</text>
  <text start="235.86" dur="3.51">become an authority in that field as</text>
  <text start="237.75" dur="4.2">well I want to get this out to the world</text>
  <text start="239.37" dur="5.13">I want to to change the world to see 60</text>
  <text start="241.95" dur="4.41">so half a spoon a day is like a good</text>
  <text start="244.5" dur="4.41">maintenance dose at least that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="246.36" dur="3.84">feel like it&amp;#39;s noticeable for many</text>
  <text start="248.91" dur="3.57">people especially if sick</text>
  <text start="250.2" dur="3.87">some people go up to do two spoons a day</text>
  <text start="252.48" dur="5.67">some people have done a bottle and a</text>
  <text start="254.07" dur="5.49">whole day it&amp;#39;s expensive to do that and</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="3.329">I think that you don&amp;#39;t need to go that</text>
  <text start="259.56" dur="4.98">far to get some of the amazing results</text>
  <text start="261.479" dur="5.521">and if you&amp;#39;re doing like topical use and</text>
  <text start="264.54" dur="4.77">things of that nature you could buy</text>
  <text start="267" dur="4.26">the fancy products for the you know the</text>
  <text start="269.31" dur="4.17">benefits of hair regrowth and cancer you</text>
  <text start="271.26" dur="6.57">know it&amp;#39;s cancer and and and wrinkles</text>
  <text start="273.48" dur="6.72">and scars and and all of that or or in</text>
  <text start="277.83" dur="4.65">acne which was like an 86% reduction act</text>
  <text start="280.2" dur="4.41">name 16 percent hair regrowth all about</text>
  <text start="282.48" dur="3.35">you could do all of that and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="3.45">probably work with some some</text>
  <text start="285.83" dur="4.48">specifically cosmetic products in the</text>
  <text start="288.06" dur="3.27">future with c60 but you could also just</text>
  <text start="290.31" dur="2.61">use coconut oil</text>
  <text start="291.33" dur="3.21">I mean coconut oil is great for the skin</text>
  <text start="292.92" dur="3.36">that&amp;#39;s right for the scalp it&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="294.54" dur="4.56">for everything on on the external use</text>
  <text start="296.28" dur="4.26">and topically it&amp;#39;s a lot cheaper to use</text>
  <text start="299.1" dur="2.67">for sure if you&amp;#39;re eating it you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.54" dur="4.68">gonna want more because there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="6.03">inside you know of course not medical</text>
  <text start="305.22" dur="5.82">advice anything like that some of the</text>
  <text start="307.8" dur="6.42">other common issues that we get there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.04" dur="4.74">air in the coconut oil sure so what we</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="3.12">do and I want to explain this because I</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="5.7">get this a lot lately and I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="317.34" dur="5.76">why but at the very top REM that REM</text>
  <text start="321.48" dur="3.15">right there just wear the cap screws on</text>
  <text start="323.1" dur="5.76">and you can kind of see the threads of</text>
  <text start="324.63" dur="5.82">the glass we leave that part empty just</text>
  <text start="328.86" dur="3.119">in case there&amp;#39;s any sort of expansion or</text>
  <text start="330.45" dur="3.75">problems with it because coconut oil is</text>
  <text start="331.979" dur="4.5">always back and forth liquid solid solid</text>
  <text start="334.2" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s the biggest question that we get</text>
  <text start="336.479" dur="3.601">is why is the coconut a little solid I</text>
  <text start="338.46" dur="4.709">thought do I have to eat this what do I</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="4.47">do personally if it&amp;#39;s solid that day</text>
  <text start="343.169" dur="3.06">because it&amp;#39;s a cold day or it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="3.42">morning or whatever or I left it in the</text>
  <text start="346.229" dur="4.051">fridge or something I just scoop it off</text>
  <text start="347.97" dur="4.14">like a cream with a spoon or something I</text>
  <text start="350.28" dur="3.21">just like you need to happen eat my</text>
  <text start="352.11" dur="3.72">portion you know it&amp;#39;s melted in the</text>
  <text start="353.49" dur="4.95">mouth anyway it&amp;#39;s easy way to give it to</text>
  <text start="355.83" dur="4.23">the dogs a little chunk you know various</text>
  <text start="358.44" dur="3.74">things or sometimes I&amp;#39;ll drizzle it into</text>
  <text start="360.06" dur="4.83">their kibble just give them a little bit</text>
  <text start="362.18" dur="4.739">because I love to give this to my past</text>
  <text start="364.89" dur="4.05">I&amp;#39;m telling you this is amazing for pets</text>
  <text start="366.919" dur="5.171">and there&amp;#39;s some of the stories of sick</text>
  <text start="368.94" dur="4.89">pets with traicee 60s the results speak</text>
  <text start="372.09" dur="4.23">for themselves that&amp;#39;s why I started the</text>
  <text start="373.83" dur="4.38">free trial because of some of the</text>
  <text start="376.32" dur="5.88">results that I was getting I knew people</text>
  <text start="378.21" dur="6.84">try this I know they&amp;#39;re gonna want it so</text>
  <text start="382.2" dur="5.34">those are some of the biggies you know</text>
  <text start="385.05" dur="5.369">it&amp;#39;s fine to eat it solid not a big deal</text>
  <text start="387.54" dur="6.84">it&amp;#39;s just coconut oil is a temperamental</text>
  <text start="390.419" dur="6.481">oil around human comfort levels so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.38" dur="4.469">just back and forth all the time I think</text>
  <text start="396.9" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s kind of the biggest issues that</text>
  <text start="398.849" dur="3.181">we&amp;#39;ve had so far I mean</text>
  <text start="400.62" dur="3.269">people ask a lot about how to take it</text>
  <text start="402.03" dur="3.33">they ask a lot about the dosing I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="403.889" dur="2.101">a couple of issues about the air bubble</text>
  <text start="405.36" dur="2.7">complaint</text>
  <text start="405.99" dur="3.27">you know understandably cuz if you&amp;#39;re if</text>

  <text start="409.26" dur="5.219">upside-down and I turned solid and you</text>
  <text start="411.36" dur="4.529">get a pure smooth slate under the lid</text>
  <text start="414.479" dur="3.211">when you open it up but there&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="415.889" dur="3.181">air gap in the bottom it&amp;#39;s gonna feel</text>
  <text start="417.69" dur="4.14">like a little deceptive I understand</text>
  <text start="419.07" dur="4.319">that for sure so I think that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="421.83" dur="3.589">biggies and I&amp;#39;m gonna have a frequently</text>
  <text start="423.389" dur="4.471">asked questions section on the websites</text>

  <text start="751.799" dur="5.01">the first thing I would do is check with</text>
  <text start="755.429" dur="3.78">somebody to make sure like a you know a</text>
  <text start="756.809" dur="4.08">trained holistic doctor I&amp;#39;m trained in</text>

  <text start="765.059" dur="3.3">would start eating just juicing I would</text>
  <text start="767.1" dur="3.329">actually not eating anything just</text>
  <text start="768.359" dur="4.35">drinking juices every day basically the</text>

  <text start="775.679" dur="5.13">stuff but you know pairing that up with</text>
  <text start="778.499" dur="6.06">a little bit of nutritionist advice you</text>
  <text start="780.809" dur="5.85">would lose 400 pounds back down to 150</text>

  <text start="789.959" dur="4.56">giving any kind of medical advice or</text>
  <text start="791.369" dur="6.66">claims but it melts off at such a speed</text>

  <text start="798.029" dur="3.93">fat at that level you would have to</text>
  <text start="799.889" dur="4.081">the hospital is probably gonna die and</text>
  <text start="801.959" dur="4.17">yet it&amp;#39;s completely safe to do it this</text>
  <text start="803.97" dur="3.479">way within the context of what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="806.129" dur="3.15">saying you know getting the advice and</text>
  <text start="807.449" dur="3.24">stuff you can overload the system you</text>

  <text start="821.85" dur="4.159">pre-existing conditions so that is</text>
  <text start="823.799" dur="4.111">something to take into account as well</text>
  <text start="826.009" dur="3.37">you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of things I can</text>
  <text start="827.91" dur="3.299">share research on but that&amp;#39;s it I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="829.379" dur="3.411">can&amp;#39;t give it medical advice or claims</text>

  <text start="853.379" dur="4.26">said so far pretty minimal a guy who did</text>
  <text start="855.839" dur="4.11">the rat study said safe at high levels</text>
  <text start="857.639" dur="5.721">over long periods of time there is</text>
  <text start="859.949" dur="6.3">potentially some concern around oxidized</text>

  <text start="866.249" dur="6.601">let out oxidized c60 the real risk that</text>
  <text start="870.839" dur="4.71">I have seen in this market are those who</text>
  <text start="872.85" dur="4.5">will buy the the unclean c60 that has</text>

  <text start="889.709" dur="4.86">your homework I&amp;#39;m really concerned that</text>

  <text start="1239.02" dur="4.44">is amazing it&amp;#39;s exciting it&amp;#39;s wonderful</text>
  <text start="1241.33" dur="4.5">most people think of it&amp;#39;s a laundry</text>

  <text start="1277.63" dur="4.35">make any money telling you about it you</text>
  <text start="1279.73" dur="4.95">buy it at Walmart I threw some of that</text>
  <text start="1281.98" dur="4.38">in then I made an elixir you can find</text>
  <text start="1284.68" dur="3.62">the recipe and my videos over other</text>
  <text start="1286.36" dur="5.34">videos like Earth Clinic or something</text>
  <text start="1288.3" dur="4.69">you can make a barracks solution which</text>

  <text start="1295.09" dur="5.46">fleas I think but I drink it internally</text>
  <text start="1297.64" dur="4.71">why do I drink borax internally presumes</text>
  <text start="1300.55" dur="4.08">boron in it and borax itself is</text>
  <text start="1302.35" dur="4.29">considered to be safer than salt they</text>
  <text start="1304.63" dur="3.69">mine it in a similar way from Turkey in</text>
  <text start="1306.64" dur="3.75">California where axis actually quite</text>

  <text start="1310.39" dur="2.97">you want to escape doing it that way I</text>
  <text start="1311.62" dur="4.38">always like to go to the source and get</text>
  <text start="1313.36" dur="4.14">the good stuff but a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="1316" dur="5.88">weird about eating you know laundry</text>
  <text start="1317.5" dur="7.59">detergent so I make it back so boron is</text>
  <text start="1321.88" dur="5.58">exciting for many things but primarily I</text>
  <text start="1325.09" dur="4.38">feel like I can&amp;#39;t make claims but based</text>
