  <text start="0.949" dur="5.231">welcome back my friends I wanted to this</text>
  <text start="4.62" dur="3.75">was in the comments and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="6.18" dur="3.66">basically just kind of throw my idea out</text>
  <text start="8.37" dur="3.72">there I&amp;#39;ve been talking about it before</text>
  <text start="9.84" dur="3.6">but while I&amp;#39;m in town anyway</text>
  <text start="12.09" dur="3.209">if I were gonna do something like this</text>
  <text start="13.44" dur="3.81">it would probably be while I&amp;#39;m down here</text>
  <text start="15.299" dur="4.801">in the city and have access to this</text>
  <text start="17.25" dur="4.32">stuff so if there is interest if you</text>
  <text start="20.1" dur="3.269">know if you guys are out there some of</text>
  <text start="21.57" dur="3.6">my viewers if you&amp;#39;re out there facing</text>
  <text start="23.369" dur="3.271">down ante five if you&amp;#39;re out there going</text>
  <text start="25.17" dur="3.269">to these rallies and you want to be safe</text>
  <text start="26.64" dur="4.379">or if you just want something to throw</text>
  <text start="28.439" dur="6.541">in here self-defense Arsenal or whatever</text>
  <text start="31.019" dur="5.371">I am going to at some point when I have</text>
  <text start="34.98" dur="3.18">funds you know it&amp;#39;s one of those little</text>
  <text start="36.39" dur="6.48">projects I want to do to help people I</text>
  <text start="38.16" dur="7.26">want to get a workable sort of a</text>
  <text start="42.87" dur="6.24">template kind of a DIY instructional</text>
  <text start="45.42" dur="7.86">thing but also get a working prototype</text>
  <text start="49.11" dur="6.89">of a armor that would defensively only</text>
  <text start="53.28" dur="5.099">not oh not an aggressive weapon</text>
  <text start="56" dur="7.09">basically a shield for the body and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="58.379" dur="6.39">talking powerful bullet protection knife</text>
  <text start="63.09" dur="5.099">protection maybe not other joints but</text>
  <text start="64.769" dur="5.581">definitely where the plating is you</text>
  <text start="68.189" dur="3.691">probably be able to handle a small bomb</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="2.76">or a cargo you know hitting you or</text>
  <text start="71.88" dur="3.12">something like that to that this stuff</text>
  <text start="73.11" dur="3.84">is powerful if you want to watch videos</text>
  <text start="75" dur="6.38">of it go check out videos it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="76.95" dur="6.36">poly was it polycarbonate and it is</text>
  <text start="81.38" dur="3.279">especially if you get like the double</text>
  <text start="83.31" dur="3.059">wall or the triple wall it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="84.659" dur="3.481">like that acrylic stuff that really hard</text>
  <text start="86.369" dur="3.601">stuff that they sometimes will replace</text>
  <text start="88.14" dur="3.99">windows with because they&amp;#39;re tired of</text>
  <text start="89.97" dur="4.62">birds breaking them or golf balls going</text>
  <text start="92.13" dur="4.77">through acrylic I think is like 30 times</text>
  <text start="94.59" dur="4.4">stronger or less breakable than glass</text>
  <text start="96.9" dur="4.17">and a little bit of flexibility to it</text>
  <text start="98.99" dur="3.79">polycarbonate if I recall and this is</text>
  <text start="101.07" dur="3.99">just off like it&amp;#39;s been years since I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="102.78" dur="3.72">done this research because I was gonna</text>
  <text start="105.06" dur="4.08">use it when I was a rental property to</text>
  <text start="106.5" dur="4.35">make highly insulated and basically</text>
  <text start="109.14" dur="3">indestructible windows because people</text>
  <text start="110.85" dur="3.809">kept breaking my darn windows and</text>
  <text start="112.14" dur="4.53">insulation was just it would be very</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="3.57">cheap to add in triple wall</text>
  <text start="116.67" dur="6.239">polycarbonate windows that you can see</text>
  <text start="118.229" dur="6.121">through to replace that lost that point</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="3.21">of loss for heating and cooling you know</text>
  <text start="124.35" dur="3.689">windows are like 30% or more of your</text>
  <text start="126.119" dur="4.56">heating and cooling loss so I got into</text>
  <text start="128.039" dur="4.711">this material from an interest of making</text>
  <text start="130.679" dur="3.061">money as a real estate guy but I</text>
  <text start="132.75" dur="2.73">discovered it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="133.74" dur="4.62">fit for protecting your home from</text>
  <text start="135.48" dur="6.24">burglars or from you know if you wanted</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="4.83">to create some sort of small bunker or</text>
  <text start="141.72" dur="2.61">something that would that would be</text>
  <text start="143.19" dur="3.12">bulletproof in your home</text>
  <text start="144.33" dur="3.39">I had a drive-by happen one time nearby</text>
  <text start="146.31" dur="3.24">near my home wasn&amp;#39;t even a bad</text>
  <text start="147.72" dur="3.27">neighborhood it was in the city though</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="2.61">and that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons I wanted</text>
  <text start="150.99" dur="3.09">to get out of there there was bullets in</text>
  <text start="152.16" dur="6.36">the dirt near the house nothing was hit</text>
  <text start="154.08" dur="5.54">just just the dirt but it was you know</text>
  <text start="158.52" dur="3.12">[Music]</text>
  <text start="159.62" dur="3.34">you know you could build a box out of</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="2.49">the stuff in your house and just go in</text>
  <text start="162.96" dur="5.22">the box whenever there&amp;#39;s something going</text>
  <text start="164.13" dur="5.91">on outside just be safe this stuff is</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="3.93">powerful polycarbonate is very powerful</text>
  <text start="170.04" dur="3.93">and if I could heat bend it which</text>
  <text start="172.11" dur="5.25">plastic heat bends fairly well if I</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="5.04">could get into some sort of skill with</text>
  <text start="177.36" dur="3.75">doing that that I could take a sheet of</text>
  <text start="179.01" dur="3.9">this stuff probably turn it in one sheet</text>
  <text start="181.11" dur="4.7">into enough for one or two people and</text>
  <text start="182.91" dur="5.4">then you&amp;#39;re covered you have you know</text>
  <text start="185.81" dur="4.42">imagine like metal armors the way they</text>
  <text start="188.31" dur="3.51">would Bend the plates around and tie</text>
  <text start="190.23" dur="3.27">them off where they would Bend the</text>
  <text start="191.82" dur="2.73">breastplate around or connect two pieces</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="2.88">of breastplate that kind of thing</text>
  <text start="194.55" dur="3.69">protect all of your vital organs a</text>
  <text start="196.38" dur="3.36">motorcycle helmets fine for the head but</text>
  <text start="198.24" dur="2.61">everything else doesn&amp;#39;t have protection</text>
  <text start="199.74" dur="4.71">you can build this stuff for the neck</text>
  <text start="200.85" dur="6.38">and it&amp;#39;s lightweight like plastic if</text>
  <text start="204.45" dur="5.22">this is an interest I would be up for</text>
  <text start="207.23" dur="3.97">playing around with it if people want to</text>
  <text start="209.67" dur="4.47">get with me and we can figure out some</text>
  <text start="211.2" dur="5.34">way to finance and and buy the materials</text>
  <text start="214.14" dur="3.93">and then and then you know we&amp;#39;ll figure</text>
  <text start="216.54" dur="3.99">out how to eat bend it and stuff later</text>
  <text start="218.07" dur="3.78">on probably buy some kind of dummy or</text>
  <text start="220.53" dur="4.26">something and then wrap it to the dummy</text>
  <text start="221.85" dur="4.2">so you can kind of understand how how</text>
  <text start="224.79" dur="2.76">useful this might be in a situation</text>
  <text start="226.05" dur="2.79">where you&amp;#39;re in the streets and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.55" dur="2.88">worried that one of these guys is gonna</text>
  <text start="228.84" dur="3.45">hit you with a lock in a rock or or a</text>
  <text start="230.43" dur="5.1">pole that&amp;#39;s painted like plastic on a</text>
  <text start="232.29" dur="6.24">sign or baseball bat or flamethrower</text>
  <text start="235.53" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;ve seen these or a giant this size</text>
  <text start="238.53" dur="2.82">rock comes out of nowhere because</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re anonymous and they can throw</text>
  <text start="241.35" dur="4.32">stuff at you all oh my gosh all the time</text>
  <text start="243.24" dur="4.2">or a bomb goes Rock right next to you I</text>
  <text start="245.67" dur="4.95">mean are you gonna feel confident</text>
  <text start="247.44" dur="6.03">walking around in something like flannel</text>
  <text start="250.62" dur="3.99">or jeans you know or are you gonna feel</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="3.03">more confident walking around in</text>
  <text start="254.61" dur="3.12">bulletproof plastic I think this is the</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="2.88">stuff they used for the police shields</text>
  <text start="257.73" dur="3.96">to imagine being surrounded in a police</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="4.02">shielding you have have my idea</text>
  <text start="261.69" dur="5.49">this is just a concept that was playing</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="4.35">around in my head I&amp;#39;m always seeing the</text>
  <text start="267.18" dur="2.28">problem</text>
  <text start="267.75" dur="6.81">of our movement and trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="269.46" dur="6.18">ways to address them this is one and you</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="2.49">know how many people are gonna show up</text>
  <text start="275.64" dur="2.58">to these fights if everybody&amp;#39;s wearing</text>
  <text start="277.05" dur="4.74">this stuff and nobody can get hurt</text>
  <text start="278.22" dur="4.95">anymore right and it&amp;#39;s affordable I</text>
  <text start="281.79" dur="3.78">imagine I think it&amp;#39;s not too expensive</text>
  <text start="283.17" dur="4.05">to buy the plastic sheets may not look</text>
  <text start="285.57" dur="3">pretty but you&amp;#39;ve got the idea that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="287.22" dur="3.6">I just wanted to get this out there if</text>
  <text start="288.57" dur="3.51">there&amp;#39;s interest you guys can hit me up</text>
  <text start="290.82" dur="3.93">through my website that&amp;#39;s the new most</text>
  <text start="292.08" dur="4.05">calm I don&amp;#39;t necessarily have to be the</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="4.11">one that does this I would just like to</text>
  <text start="296.13" dur="4.289">be involved with whoever maybe someone</text>
  <text start="298.86" dur="3.51">else wants to do this and practice and</text>
  <text start="300.419" dur="3.691">get something and then I can help get</text>
  <text start="302.37" dur="4.17">the idea out there or share the the</text>
  <text start="304.11" dur="3.69">plans or maybe as a business idea if you</text>
  <text start="306.54" dur="3.75">want to open up a business creating this</text>
  <text start="307.8" dur="4.5">stuff I mean you don&amp;#39;t have to - to make</text>
  <text start="310.29" dur="4.5">bulletproof armor vests and stuff like</text>
  <text start="312.3" dur="4.44">that that are that are heavy even the</text>
  <text start="314.79" dur="6.36">more modern ones that can stop multiple</text>
  <text start="316.74" dur="6.15">bullets are very still fairly heavy you</text>
  <text start="321.15" dur="3.78">know a triple wall polycarbonate may not</text>
  <text start="322.89" dur="3.48">be as rated as one of those things but</text>
  <text start="324.93" dur="3.239">you can do amazing things with the</text>
  <text start="326.37" dur="3.69">sandwich pieces of tile together that</text>
  <text start="328.169" dur="3.75">will stop most of all it&amp;#39;s I mean there</text>
  <text start="330.06" dur="4.35">are cheap options at home you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
