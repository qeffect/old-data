  <text start="4.6" dur="5.82">the majority home country that believes</text>
  <text start="7.84" dur="23.73">in freedom to liberty are being held</text>
  <text start="10.42" dur="23.13">back by the most welcome back my friends</text>
  <text start="31.57" dur="4.29">this is destiny most of the Nemo&amp;#39;s news</text>
  <text start="33.55" dur="4.2">network I&amp;#39;m joined by my friend Lynette</text>
  <text start="35.86" dur="3.66">Xing she calls me her favorite</text>
  <text start="37.75" dur="3.51">millennial and she&amp;#39;s kind of a cool</text>
  <text start="39.52" dur="4.559">honor but she&amp;#39;s the chief financial</text>
  <text start="41.26" dur="4.77">analyst of ITM trading and an all-around</text>
  <text start="44.079" dur="5.16">smart person to listen to especially in</text>
  <text start="46.03" dur="5.04">these weird economic times I watched</text>
  <text start="49.239" dur="3.421">your live stream earlier Lynette and</text>
  <text start="51.07" dur="3.509">I&amp;#39;ve already known things are getting</text>
  <text start="52.66" dur="3.449">really bad but you know the silver and</text>
  <text start="54.579" dur="3.421">gold seem to be doing kind of well</text>
  <text start="56.109" dur="3.961">versus other things it&amp;#39;s just really</text>
  <text start="58" dur="3.78">weird right now not to mention what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="60.07" dur="3.78">going on with President Trump in China</text>
  <text start="61.78" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s very confusing could you help us to</text>
  <text start="63.85" dur="5.01">understand where we are and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="65.41" dur="4.319">happening right now well you know where</text>
  <text start="68.86" dur="4.11">do we start</text>
  <text start="69.729" dur="5.491">because really what we&amp;#39;ve got is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="72.97" dur="4.89">not that it&amp;#39;s just an escalating trade</text>
  <text start="75.22" dur="4.98">war I think that that was really created</text>
  <text start="77.86" dur="5.13">to mask the truth of what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="80.2" dur="6.54">happening because because the system</text>
  <text start="82.99" dur="6.57">really died in 2008 so now we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="86.74" dur="4.53">into this tit for tat a trade war but</text>
  <text start="89.56" dur="5.9">the biggest threat and this happened</text>
  <text start="91.27" dur="7.919">even before that was the yield curve</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="7.51">inversions where your shorter term pays</text>
  <text start="99.189" dur="5.851">you more than your longer term why would</text>
  <text start="102.97" dur="5.939">the world would you loan money to</text>
  <text start="105.04" dur="6.719">somebody for 30 years for less than you</text>
  <text start="108.909" dur="6.541">would loan them money overnight right</text>
  <text start="111.759" dur="6.14">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="115.45" dur="4.98">that actually has been happening</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="4.36">probably happened before this but the</text>
  <text start="120.43" dur="6.289">first time that I really noticed it on a</text>
  <text start="122.259" dur="9.511">global scale was I believe in May of</text>
  <text start="126.719" dur="7.061">2018 when China&amp;#39;s yield curve inverted</text>
  <text start="131.77" dur="5.01">and they were still talking about how</text>
  <text start="133.78" dur="4.71">strong growth in China was at that point</text>
  <text start="136.78" dur="5.25">well we&amp;#39;re not talking about</text>
  <text start="138.49" dur="6.27">anymore are they yes and that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="142.03" dur="5.67">only country now where the yield curves</text>
  <text start="144.76" dur="5.22">are inverted when I checked this and</text>
  <text start="147.7" dur="4.83">that was a few weeks ago I think I did</text>
  <text start="149.98" dur="5.85">that one on the global the one that says</text>
  <text start="152.53" dur="7.59">grab your popcorn where you have 35</text>
  <text start="155.83" dur="8.78">countries that now have not just</text>
  <text start="160.12" dur="7.77">inverted yield curve but negative</text>
  <text start="164.61" dur="5.47">inverted yield curves that&amp;#39;s insanity</text>
  <text start="167.89" dur="4.22">and that&amp;#39;s unheard of until the modern</text>
  <text start="170.08" dur="5.13">era right no one&amp;#39;s ever gone negative</text>
  <text start="172.11" dur="6.19">because actly this is this is the first</text>
  <text start="175.21" dur="5.61">time in history so when the central</text>
  <text start="178.3" dur="5.1">bankers and the pundits will say well</text>
  <text start="180.82" dur="4.5">this time is different because after I</text>
  <text start="183.4" dur="4.86">mean this kills me it kills me because</text>
  <text start="185.32" dur="5.16">after all we now have 16 trillion and</text>
  <text start="188.26" dur="4.53">negative yielding debt and that&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="190.48" dur="4.49">so this time is different yeah I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="192.79" dur="8.13">thinking this time it&amp;#39;s a lot worse</text>
  <text start="194.97" dur="9.76">because the last time was just just but</text>
  <text start="200.92" dur="8.01">it was a recession this time it&amp;#39;s worse</text>
  <text start="204.73" dur="6.51">because it is a reset of the entire</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="5.13">entire global financial system and</text>
  <text start="211.24" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s really what those negative yields</text>
  <text start="214.06" dur="4.59">are those negative yields and then and</text>
  <text start="216.25" dur="5.7">the yield curve inversions are all about</text>
  <text start="218.65" dur="4.83">really so this comes into like a how</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="3.6">does that compare first of all to a</text>
  <text start="223.48" dur="5.85">depression versus a reset and then also</text>
  <text start="225.55" dur="6.06">kind of a second point about is that</text>
  <text start="229.33" dur="3.45">kind of gonna end up as I see it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.61" dur="3.57">going to end up with more mouths to feed</text>
  <text start="232.78" dur="4.26">than resources to pay for it eventually</text>
  <text start="235.18" dur="6.66">and you&amp;#39;re kind of just paying people to</text>
  <text start="237.04" dur="7.65">not riot right well you know yeah</text>
  <text start="241.84" dur="5.07">absolutely but you know I mean we can go</text>
  <text start="244.69" dur="5.67">to the devastation in the farm community</text>
  <text start="246.91" dur="6.42">in this country because a lot of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.36" dur="6.09">happened with all the subsidies etc etc</text>
  <text start="253.33" dur="6.09">but there is a rash of small farmers</text>
  <text start="256.45" dur="4.5">that are now bankrupt they&amp;#39;re out of</text>
  <text start="259.42" dur="5.97">business which means they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="260.95" dur="6.939">producing and even if a larger farm took</text>
  <text start="265.39" dur="6.76">them over it takes a while to year</text>
  <text start="267.889" dur="6.571">so you are spot on and this is one</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="7.53">reason why food becomes the biggest</text>
  <text start="274.46" dur="9.079">issue during these resets now a</text>
  <text start="279.68" dur="8.639">depression is just a severe form of</text>
  <text start="283.539" dur="7.211">recession right and and deflation so</text>
  <text start="288.319" dur="4.65">those three are tied together the stock</text>
  <text start="290.75" dur="5.879">market imploding and taking everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.969" dur="7.47">retirement money with it hmm yeah a</text>
  <text start="296.629" dur="7.951">depression and not only that but a</text>
  <text start="300.439" dur="6.931">depression also has to do with the speed</text>
  <text start="304.58" dur="6.54">at which money changes hands because if</text>
  <text start="307.37" dur="6.419">you&amp;#39;re not confident in your job in your</text>
  <text start="311.12" dur="6.359">income then you would have a tendency to</text>
  <text start="313.789" dur="6.861">save more rather than rush out and spend</text>
  <text start="317.479" dur="8.55">unless we go into the hyperinflation</text>
  <text start="320.65" dur="8.56">where you visibly see the value of your</text>
  <text start="326.029" dur="5.341">dollar in this country declining so</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="4.25">rapidly that as soon as it comes into</text>
  <text start="331.37" dur="8.159">your hands you&amp;#39;re gonna spend it right</text>
  <text start="333.46" dur="7.69">and a deflation depression whatever you</text>
  <text start="339.529" dur="4.021">want to call it in there that&amp;#39;s all the</text>
  <text start="341.15" dur="4.139">same is the flipside to the</text>
  <text start="343.55" dur="3.539">hyperinflation because there&amp;#39;s only one</text>
  <text start="345.289" dur="5.1">way to fight that stuff with and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.089" dur="6.871">with inflation and here&amp;#39;s the big kicker</text>
  <text start="350.389" dur="6.21">because the genius seriously the genius</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="5.16">of the entire global monetary fiat</text>
  <text start="356.599" dur="7.051">system was that it was the first time</text>
  <text start="359.12" dur="6.96">pardon evil genius well yeah it was the</text>
  <text start="363.65" dur="5.4">first time historically that a central</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="6.78">bank had attempted to control rate and</text>
  <text start="369.05" dur="7.229">speed of inflation that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.86" dur="4.979">lasted for over a hundred years because</text>
  <text start="376.279" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve had the ability to</text>
  <text start="377.839" dur="6.211">control using interest rates to do that</text>
  <text start="381.529" dur="5.281">oh they want more borrowing and spending</text>
  <text start="384.05" dur="5.13">and they want inflation to speed up they</text>
  <text start="386.81" dur="4.59">lower interest rate inspire people to</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="5.159">come in and borrow and spend and there</text>
  <text start="391.4" dur="4.799">you get your inflation ah inflation is</text>
  <text start="394.339" dur="4.021">running too hot in other words it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="396.199" dur="3.401">noticeable and people are complaining</text>
  <text start="398.36" dur="4">you Ray</text>
  <text start="399.6" dur="6.69">the interest rates that inspires people</text>
  <text start="402.36" dur="5.58">not to borrow and spend but what do you</text>
  <text start="406.29" dur="3.84">do when you&amp;#39;re at when you&amp;#39;re at zero</text>
  <text start="407.94" dur="7.26">bound which is where we&amp;#39;ve been for a</text>
  <text start="410.13" dur="7.83">decade now working right you see the</text>
  <text start="415.2" dur="5.28">problem they&amp;#39;ve used up all of their</text>
  <text start="417.96" dur="5.13">tools that&amp;#39;s a key tool so next of</text>
  <text start="420.48" dur="4.5">course is just blatant money printing so</text>
  <text start="423.09" dur="4.92">whether it&amp;#39;s whether they put a name</text>
  <text start="424.98" dur="5.58">around it like mmm tea or I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="428.01" dur="4.74">Blackrock I have to look into this a</text>
  <text start="430.56" dur="4.98">little bit more I can&amp;#39;t remember what</text>
  <text start="432.75" dur="5.22">government he was saying just acid eyes</text>
  <text start="435.54" dur="4.14">that you know I mean I think Blackrock</text>
  <text start="437.97" dur="3.63">should just give their shares away then</text>
  <text start="439.68" dur="7.47">you&amp;#39;d have lots of people that hold them</text>
  <text start="441.6" dur="9.72">Why Why ask for Fiat you know why oh I</text>
  <text start="447.15" dur="6.75">asked people to pay for them so yeah</text>
  <text start="451.32" dur="11.37">depression is the opposite side and by</text>
  <text start="453.9" dur="13.5">the way was 2013 I think I think it was</text>
  <text start="462.69" dur="7.5">2013 the New York Fed did a study and in</text>
  <text start="467.4" dur="5.58">it they looked at the how quickly people</text>
  <text start="470.19" dur="5.27">spent money the monetary velocity during</text>
  <text start="472.98" dur="7.02">the Depression back in the thirties and</text>
  <text start="475.46" dur="7.65">up to 2013 and guess what it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="480" dur="5.4">worse and gotten a lot worse since then</text>
  <text start="483.11" dur="4.93">so it&amp;#39;s worse than it was in the</text>
  <text start="485.4" dur="5.91">depression maybe wearing one and we just</text>
  <text start="488.04" dur="7.14">haven&amp;#39;t admitted it what do you think so</text>
  <text start="491.31" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re going from sort of a false you</text>
  <text start="495.18" dur="2.58">know great economy which you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="496.53" dur="3.66">been kind of harping on it the whole</text>
  <text start="497.76" dur="3.78">time it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s built on eggshells it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="500.19" dur="3.84">falling apart and everything bubble</text>
  <text start="501.54" dur="4.17">everything else and and it does seem to</text>
  <text start="504.03" dur="3.33">be worldwide some would argue that the</text>
  <text start="505.71" dur="4.98">US is still the strongest of all these</text>
  <text start="507.36" dur="4.859">losing you know assets or fianc but you</text>
  <text start="510.69" dur="4.26">know obviously versus gold and silver</text>
  <text start="512.219" dur="5.731">they&amp;#39;re not doing too well but is this</text>
  <text start="514.95" dur="5.58">gonna be moving into the hole</text>
  <text start="517.95" dur="5.37">reset soon can the dollar survive this</text>
  <text start="520.53" dur="5.34">is a petrol dollar like obviously that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.32" dur="4.02">dying it and I saw a graph for the other</text>
  <text start="525.87" dur="3.45">currencies are there other countries</text>
  <text start="527.34" dur="3.9">holding the US dollar as reserves that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="529.32" dur="3.449">going way down so like the height dollar</text>
  <text start="531.24" dur="4.019">it seems to be just trending</text>
  <text start="532.769" dur="4.23">away from global use and that&amp;#39;s a bit</text>
  <text start="535.259" dur="3.63">for us as well so that all of that could</text>
  <text start="536.999" dur="4.02">be a perfect storm for for like the</text>
  <text start="538.889" dur="4.49">destruction of our American Way of life</text>
  <text start="541.019" dur="4.92">and middle class whatever&amp;#39;s left of it</text>
  <text start="543.379" dur="4.3">what what happens after that I mean will</text>
  <text start="545.939" dur="3.81">there be food on the shelves I mean it</text>
  <text start="547.679" dur="3.541">was they&amp;#39;re gonna be kind of it will it</text>
  <text start="549.749" dur="2.911">get so bad that they have to bring in</text>
  <text start="551.22" dur="7.14">military just to make sure that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="552.66" dur="8.279">food I mean to bring in the military to</text>
  <text start="558.36" dur="5.31">make sure there&amp;#39;s food or to take the</text>
  <text start="560.939" dur="5.791">food that there is I don&amp;#39;t know well yes</text>
  <text start="563.67" dur="4.199">well on they brought the military in to</text>
  <text start="566.73" dur="3.359">I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="567.869" dur="4.83">control of food and I don&amp;#39;t know that it</text>
  <text start="570.089" dur="5.04">really made it to where it needed to</text>
  <text start="572.699" dur="5.281">make it but I want to kind of back up</text>
  <text start="575.129" dur="5.58">for just one second based on something</text>
  <text start="577.98" dur="6.18">that you just said about you know</text>
  <text start="580.709" dur="7.581">globally the g7 just met now the g7 are</text>
  <text start="584.16" dur="9.899">all allies right Canada the UK France</text>
  <text start="588.29" dur="7.69">Germany the US and there&amp;#39;s one word that</text>
  <text start="594.059" dur="7.77">I&amp;#39;m missing Japan</text>
  <text start="595.98" dur="8.37">sort of these days yeah so so there was</text>
  <text start="601.829" dur="5.76">a lot of contention at the meeting this</text>
  <text start="604.35" dur="7.919">that just happened it&amp;#39;s like yeah it</text>
  <text start="607.589" dur="6.54">just happened and so what is between our</text>
  <text start="612.269" dur="4.92">president and then all those other</text>
  <text start="614.129" dur="5.101">countries and not just about the trade</text>
  <text start="617.189" dur="4.83">war with Canada but there were a lot of</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="4.649">other topics that are impacting all of</text>
  <text start="622.019" dur="5.55">these countries Italy is in there as</text>
  <text start="623.879" dur="5.161">well that are in deep doo-doo i mean i</text>
  <text start="627.569" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t know how else you said i mean</text>
  <text start="629.04" dur="5.519">you&amp;#39;ve got the brexit that maybe will be</text>
  <text start="632.189" dur="6.96">you know the UK that will be crashing</text>
  <text start="634.559" dur="7.62">out of the EU system in on october 31st</text>
  <text start="639.149" dur="4.41">italy&amp;#39;s parliament is suspended so at</text>
  <text start="642.179" dur="4.801">the moment they don&amp;#39;t even have a</text>
  <text start="643.559" dur="6.421">government I mean Germany is in</text>
  <text start="646.98" dur="5.909">recession and all of these bonds by the</text>
  <text start="649.98" dur="5.49">way all our 10-year government bonds in</text>
  <text start="652.889" dur="4.771">these countries well maybe not all of</text>
  <text start="655.47" dur="5.579">them but most of them are trading at</text>
  <text start="657.66" dur="7.32">historically low levels why because you</text>
  <text start="661.049" dur="5.091">think they&amp;#39;re so safe and by the way why</text>
  <text start="664.98" dur="3.29">are you giving up</text>
  <text start="666.14" dur="4.08">of all knowingly giving a principal</text>
  <text start="668.27" dur="4.67">because you think you might lose less</text>
  <text start="670.22" dur="6.72">that way I mean stop and think about</text>
  <text start="672.94" dur="7.74">what&amp;#39;s happening in here and my concern</text>
  <text start="676.94" dur="6.72">is that those allies turn into enemies</text>
  <text start="680.68" dur="5.05">because when you look at those countries</text>
  <text start="683.66" dur="5.79">that have held the world reserve</text>
  <text start="685.73" dur="5.61">currency status which means that if</text>

  <text start="697.34" dur="6.62">whatever it is you this is no longer</text>
  <text start="701.27" dur="6.96">true but basically you have no other</text>
  <text start="703.96" dur="7.51">option but to use US dollars to make</text>
  <text start="708.23" dur="6.75">those purchases so huge advantage the US</text>
  <text start="711.47" dur="5.31">has been and again it&amp;#39;s been this has</text>
  <text start="714.98" dur="4.14">been really been shifting started the</text>
  <text start="716.78" dur="7.08">shift in 2002 it&amp;#39;s just kind of</text>
  <text start="719.12" dur="8.13">ratcheted up over time but up until that</text>
  <text start="723.86" dur="6.09">point the US was the only country that</text>
  <text start="727.25" dur="4.8">could print of the money they needed to</text>
  <text start="729.95" dur="4.02">repay those debts that be like you</text>
  <text start="732.05" dur="4.26">having a printing press in your closet</text>
  <text start="733.97" dur="4.77">and instead of needing to go to work to</text>
  <text start="736.31" dur="5.31">make the money is random printing press</text>
  <text start="738.74" dur="4.74">and then paid your bills with it so what</text>
  <text start="741.62" dur="4.35">kind of an advantage would that be</text>
  <text start="743.48" dur="4.38">really when you think about it it&amp;#39;s huge</text>
  <text start="745.97" dur="3.87">forced monopoly over the whole world</text>
  <text start="747.86" dur="3.63">currency system that&amp;#39;s half of every</text>
  <text start="749.84" dur="3.32">transaction that&amp;#39;s the currency that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="751.49" dur="5.79">ultimate power</text>
  <text start="753.16" dur="6.37">voilá so when you look at when these</text>
  <text start="757.28" dur="5.28">countries have lost that status it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="759.53" dur="6.72">because their allies became enemies and</text>
  <text start="762.56" dur="5.79">would no longer accept this and that is</text>
  <text start="766.25" dur="5.01">what seems to be happening right now</text>
  <text start="768.35" dur="5.52">that seems to be I mean it&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="771.26" dur="6.15">started before that but it became very</text>
  <text start="773.87" dur="6.6">obvious at the g7 meeting that just took</text>
  <text start="777.41" dur="4.89">place so that&amp;#39;s pretty concerning yeah</text>
  <text start="780.47" dur="3.84">and then Trump you know these other</text>
  <text start="782.3" dur="3.33">leaders are largely kind of globalist</text>
  <text start="784.31" dur="3.81">they don&amp;#39;t mind him it&amp;#39;s not gonna help</text>
  <text start="785.63" dur="4.32">odds there when you know they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="788.12" dur="4.86">offered better deals by Russia or China</text>
  <text start="789.95" dur="5.55">or anything like that either so kind of</text>
  <text start="792.98" dur="4.95">like you I don&amp;#39;t know China any better</text>
  <text start="795.5" dur="3.83">than anybody you know their condition is</text>
  <text start="797.93" dur="4.25">not any better than</text>
  <text start="799.33" dur="4.8">buddy else this is a global issue when</text>
  <text start="802.18" dur="5.909">one goes we all go</text>
  <text start="804.13" dur="6.649">fair enough so obviously folks with gold</text>
  <text start="808.089" dur="4.831">and silver things that they can keep</text>
  <text start="810.779" dur="3.611">commodities storable stuff so the</text>
  <text start="812.92" dur="5.789">cigarette spices or whatever it may be</text>
  <text start="814.39" dur="6.18">if you have stock you&amp;#39;re ain&amp;#39;t yeah</text>
  <text start="818.709" dur="3.931">metals always good to have and then that</text>
  <text start="820.57" dur="4.079">can get you through the hard times and</text>
  <text start="822.64" dur="3.72">I&amp;#39;ve asked before I think I got an</text>
  <text start="824.649" dur="4.651">answer one time of about 100 ounces but</text>
  <text start="826.36" dur="4.74">what would you recommend for people well</text>
  <text start="829.3" dur="5.61">first of all everybody&amp;#39;s circumstances</text>
  <text start="831.1" dur="5.52">are a little different so I created a</text>
  <text start="834.91" dur="3.84">strategy since I&amp;#39;ve been studying</text>
  <text start="836.62" dur="3.06">currencies and currency life cycles</text>
  <text start="838.75" dur="4.8">since 87</text>
  <text start="839.68" dur="7.29">I created a strategy for myself based</text>
  <text start="843.55" dur="6.57">upon historic repeatable patterns all of</text>
  <text start="846.97" dur="5.79">our strategy specialists are trained in</text>
  <text start="850.12" dur="5.159">this strategy and we have spreadsheets</text>
  <text start="852.76" dur="5.009">so we can lay things out and determine</text>
  <text start="855.279" dur="4.921">you know how much silver and what kind</text>
  <text start="857.769" dur="5.641">do you need how much gold and what kind</text>
  <text start="860.2" dur="5.67">do you need based upon your than the</text>
  <text start="863.41" dur="4.65">individuals you know goals and</text>
  <text start="865.87" dur="4.64">circumstance and what they have to work</text>
  <text start="868.06" dur="4.95">with but it&amp;#39;s really quite a</text>
  <text start="870.51" dur="6.19">comprehensive plan that we put together</text>
  <text start="873.01" dur="6.12">for our clients and so you know you</text>
  <text start="876.7" dur="5.699">definitely need physical in your</text>
  <text start="879.13" dur="5.19">possession I know the Talking Heads on</text>
  <text start="882.399" dur="5.281">Wall Street want you to think you can do</text>
  <text start="884.32" dur="6.54">it with GLD and SLV which are gold and</text>
  <text start="887.68" dur="7.43">silver trusts they are not gold and</text>
  <text start="890.86" dur="7.289">silver physical that you have access to</text>
  <text start="895.11" dur="5.41">so it&amp;#39;s not really gonna do it you gotta</text>
  <text start="898.149" dur="5.13">have the physical because the physical</text>
  <text start="900.52" dur="4.47">runs no counterparty risk everything</text>
  <text start="903.279" dur="4.021">else is counterparty risk and those</text>
  <text start="904.99" dur="5.61">counterparties a very risky right now</text>
  <text start="907.3" dur="5.789">for sure are late yeah so okay so it</text>
  <text start="910.6" dur="4.56">obviously that&amp;#39;s a wise thing to do for</text>
  <text start="913.089" dur="4.651">those who have like retirement money or</text>
  <text start="915.16" dur="4.109">401 k&amp;#39;s any of that stuff you know I</text>
  <text start="917.74" dur="3.57">heard your live chat earlier it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="919.269" dur="3.541">idea if possible you can&amp;#39;t give</text>
  <text start="921.31" dur="3.45">financial advice to people over the</text>
  <text start="922.81" dur="3.57">internet and stuff I get that but it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="924.76" dur="3.389">good idea to consider getting out of</text>
  <text start="926.38" dur="2.49">these things that are exposed to so much</text>
  <text start="928.149" dur="3.451">as you put it</text>
  <text start="928.87" dur="3.87">counterparty risk now exact something</text>
  <text start="931.6" dur="1.6">like gold and silver and you can help</text>
  <text start="932.74" dur="3.28">people do</text>
  <text start="933.2" dur="4.98">that sometimes depends on that is</text>
  <text start="936.02" dur="5.79">actually part of the strategy because</text>
  <text start="938.18" dur="5.01">some people cannot get out even you know</text>
  <text start="941.81" dur="3.45">if you&amp;#39;re still working for a</text>
  <text start="943.19" dur="3.87">corporation I&amp;#39;m you have to look you</text>
  <text start="945.26" dur="4.23">might have some options like the</text>
  <text start="947.06" dur="4.74">in-service withdrawal rollover election</text>
  <text start="949.49" dur="4.8">that enables you to move some into an</text>
  <text start="951.8" dur="4.74">IRA and then you can take distribution</text>
  <text start="954.29" dur="5.79">pay your taxes if there any penalty is</text>
  <text start="956.54" dur="6.27">what have you but sometimes you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="960.08" dur="5.97">really stuck like if you&amp;#39;ve got a 403b</text>
  <text start="962.81" dur="5.1">I gotta tell ya unless you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="966.05" dur="6.72">working there anymore you don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="967.91" dur="7.98">have any options other than protecting</text>
  <text start="972.77" dur="6.27">what you got to keep in the system so we</text>
  <text start="975.89" dur="5.4">account for that in the strategy as well</text>
  <text start="979.04" dur="5.31">we also account for any taxes or any</text>
  <text start="981.29" dur="5.25">fees or any losses or or anything</text>
  <text start="984.35" dur="5.04">because these are things that you should</text>
  <text start="986.54" dur="5.88">be looking at sure</text>
  <text start="989.39" dur="4.47">yeah well Lynette is there any other</text>
  <text start="992.42" dur="3.21">major I mean we could talk forever about</text>
  <text start="993.86" dur="3.18">some of the credit craziness going on</text>
  <text start="995.63" dur="3.06">throughout all of the economies of the</text>
  <text start="997.04" dur="3.78">world there any major points that we</text>
  <text start="998.69" dur="3.66">haven&amp;#39;t had because my primary concern</text>
  <text start="1000.82" dur="5.6">right now is just getting people ready</text>
  <text start="1002.35" dur="8.13">for what&amp;#39;s coming making sure minimize</text>
  <text start="1006.42" dur="6.1">we we are running out of time you know I</text>
  <text start="1010.48" dur="4.11">would say that the biggest thing that</text>
  <text start="1012.52" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;m noticing I mean there are so many</text>
  <text start="1014.59" dur="6.09">things like you said but I would say to</text>
  <text start="1017.11" dur="5.82">pay attention each in in the difference</text>
  <text start="1020.68" dur="5.01">between your shorter term rates and your</text>
  <text start="1022.93" dur="5.06">longer term rates because when those get</text>
  <text start="1025.69" dur="6.42">wider which is what&amp;#39;s happening that</text>
  <text start="1027.99" dur="5.68">indicates that we are than a recession</text>
  <text start="1032.11" dur="5.4">this is gonna be so much bigger than a</text>
  <text start="1033.67" dur="7.95">recession but it&amp;#39;s either imminent or it</text>
  <text start="1037.51" dur="7.29">has already begun and my bet is it has</text>
  <text start="1041.62" dur="4.92">already begun am I correct that the 10/2</text>
  <text start="1044.8" dur="5.07">indicator is a hundred percent accurate</text>
  <text start="1046.54" dur="6.54">so far for a recession three months they</text>
  <text start="1049.87" dur="7.59">tend to I think is like 99% accurate</text>
  <text start="1053.08" dur="6.99">it&amp;#39;s the ten three months that I believe</text>
  <text start="1057.46" dur="4.86">is a hundred percent accurate and the</text>
  <text start="1060.07" dur="4.35">indicator that these I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1062.32" dur="4.38">interesting the indicator that the</text>
  <text start="1064.42" dur="5.52">Federal Reserve actually</text>
  <text start="1066.7" dur="5.76">uses as a recession morning and that</text>
  <text start="1069.94" dur="4.44">averted I think it was May I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1072.46" dur="3.06">doing this right along and I&amp;#39;m pretty</text>
  <text start="1074.38" dur="3.9">sure I&amp;#39;d have to go back and</text>
  <text start="1075.52" dur="4.64">double-check but I&amp;#39;m like ninety eight</text>
  <text start="1078.28" dur="5.64">point nine percent sure that that</text>
  <text start="1080.16" dur="6.88">inversion began in May and then got</text>
  <text start="1083.92" dur="5.82">wider and wider which is why I said that</text>
  <text start="1087.04" dur="7.89">the bomb bubble was popping now about a</text>
  <text start="1089.74" dur="7.56">month or or so ago so you guys if you</text>
  <text start="1094.93" dur="4.31">have anything to save that still left in</text>
  <text start="1097.3" dur="4.65">that corrupt system with so much</text>
  <text start="1099.24" dur="5.38">counterparty risk aka corruption and</text>
  <text start="1101.95" dur="4.41">you&amp;#39;ll never get your money consider</text>
  <text start="1104.62" dur="2.46">what to do with it while you can if you</text>
  <text start="1106.36" dur="2.46">still can</text>
  <text start="1107.08" dur="4.53">time is of the essence on this I mean</text>
  <text start="1108.82" dur="4.17">I&amp;#39;ve been we&amp;#39;ve both been shouting from</text>
  <text start="1111.61" dur="2.88">the mountains as much as we could about</text>
  <text start="1112.99" dur="3.63">what&amp;#39;s coming in the economy and</text>
  <text start="1114.49" dur="3.99">everything else but you know did the</text>
  <text start="1116.62" dur="4.47">day-to-day drive and the grind just to</text>
  <text start="1118.48" dur="4.23">survive has so many people they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1121.09" dur="4.17">spend the time to focus on this and</text>
  <text start="1122.71" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s a difficult thing so these short</text>
  <text start="1125.26" dur="3.84">videos do a huge service for folks like</text>
  <text start="1127.57" dur="3.12">that who maybe don&amp;#39;t know what decision</text>
  <text start="1129.1" dur="3.12">to make and and would like just some</text>
  <text start="1130.69" dur="4.23">advice from people who have experienced</text>
  <text start="1132.22" dur="4.68">like yourself well you know what in</text>
  <text start="1134.92" dur="5.19">addition to that and and I really</text>
  <text start="1136.9" dur="5.97">believe that if you can emulate with the</text>
  <text start="1140.11" dur="4.74">smart money the smartest money on any</text>
  <text start="1142.87" dur="4.2">given topic I don&amp;#39;t care what that topic</text>
  <text start="1144.85" dur="5.01">is but what are they doing for</text>
  <text start="1147.07" dur="5.01">themselves so if you can learn where to</text>
  <text start="1149.86" dur="4.56">look to see that like what are the</text>
  <text start="1152.08" dur="5.22">central banks doing biggest amount of</text>
  <text start="1154.42" dur="5.82">gold buying ever since they started</text>
  <text start="1157.3" dur="5.25">tracking it well tell me who knows more</text>
  <text start="1160.24" dur="5.43">about money than central banks because</text>
  <text start="1162.55" dur="4.53">they create it and they well tell they</text>
  <text start="1165.67" dur="5.22">lost control of it</text>
  <text start="1167.08" dur="6.72">you know they control it so people that</text>
  <text start="1170.89" dur="6.06">understand money are buying gold and</text>
  <text start="1173.8" dur="6.21">Spiller those that understand it at a</text>
  <text start="1176.95" dur="7.35">deeper level are buying the collectible</text>
  <text start="1180.01" dur="5.55">coins because you know my personal</text>
  <text start="1184.3" dur="3.69">feeling is and I could be completely</text>
  <text start="1185.56" dur="5.16">wrong about this is not something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1187.99" dur="6.42">within my control but there is a lot of</text>
  <text start="1190.72" dur="7.34">recent as well as longer-term precedents</text>
  <text start="1194.41" dur="5.79">for government confiscation of gold and</text>
  <text start="1198.06" dur="4.75">honestly</text>
  <text start="1200.2" dur="4.53">you know I don&amp;#39;t see any way around it</text>
  <text start="1202.81" dur="3.75">and also since they&amp;#39;ve been doing it to</text>
  <text start="1204.73" dur="4.29">you your whole life confiscating your</text>
  <text start="1206.56" dur="5.37">wealth I can&amp;#39;t see that they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1209.02" dur="4.29">stop right at this last moment and go</text>
  <text start="1211.93" dur="2.73">yeah we&amp;#39;ve been doing it but we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1213.31" dur="5.4">going to do it anymore</text>
  <text start="1214.66" dur="6.36">so when you look at the ultra rarities</text>
  <text start="1218.71" dur="4.44">chart and I&amp;#39;ll pull one soon but when</text>
  <text start="1221.02" dur="4.17">you look at that the one percenter is</text>
  <text start="1223.15" dur="3.66">where these coin this is not a million</text>
  <text start="1225.19" dur="4.8">dollar coin but they&amp;#39;re certainly one</text>
  <text start="1226.81" dur="4.95">ounces that are I mean that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="1229.99" dur="3.69">one percenters that either write the</text>
  <text start="1231.76" dur="3.6">laws or have the ability to influence</text>
  <text start="1233.68" dur="2.94">those or write the laws that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1235.36" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re buying for themselves</text>
  <text start="1236.62" dur="4.47">so you can them emulate a much cheaper</text>
  <text start="1238.69" dur="4.32">than that and for those that don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1241.09" dur="5.25">time just look at what the smartest guys</text>
  <text start="1243.01" dur="6.99">are doing for themselves and emulate</text>
  <text start="1246.34" dur="5.31">them and buy gold and silver I happen to</text>
  <text start="1250" dur="4.47">have this from the live that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1251.65" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s why I keep flashing it you know I</text>
