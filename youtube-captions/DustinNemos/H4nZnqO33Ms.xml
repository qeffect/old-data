  <text start="204.1" dur="5.79">this across in Disney you see a pattern</text>
  <text start="207.31" dur="5.16">of this across you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="209.89" dur="6.2">politicians as well so this is this is</text>
  <text start="212.47" dur="3.62">what happens this is America&amp;#39;s elite</text>
  <text start="216.39" dur="4.81">tempers also flaring as I as I mentioned</text>
  <text start="218.769" dur="5.22">kind of Fukushima is plan to dump</text>
  <text start="221.2" dur="4.98">radioactive water in the ocean of all</text>
  <text start="223.989" dur="4.47">people the government there is pushing</text>
  <text start="226.18" dur="3.839">it I&amp;#39;m surprised because governments are</text>
  <text start="228.459" dur="1.981">always only concerned about short-term</text>
  <text start="230.019" dur="3.141">calm</text>
  <text start="230.44" dur="5.19">secuence is because they&amp;#39;re politicians</text>
  <text start="233.16" dur="4">and they think in terms of influence and</text>
  <text start="235.63" dur="3.84">power and then now they don&amp;#39;t think in</text>
  <text start="237.16" dur="5.06">terms of you know what&amp;#39;s gonna happen to</text>
  <text start="239.47" dur="5.75">us 50 years out because of this decision</text>
  <text start="242.22" dur="5.29">so you know they&amp;#39;re always willing to</text>
  <text start="245.22" dur="4.87">sell you into debt sell you into</text>
  <text start="247.51" dur="3.96">long-term devastation or consequence in</text>
  <text start="250.09" dur="5.31">order for a short term burst that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="251.47" dur="6">politicians do so it&amp;#39;s no surprise that</text>
  <text start="255.4" dur="6.36">you know government is the most</text>
  <text start="257.47" dur="6.59">destructive you know I guess agency out</text>
  <text start="261.76" dur="4.2">there when it comes to the environment</text>
  <text start="264.06" dur="3.49">and I&amp;#39;m of course I&amp;#39;m gonna talk about</text>
  <text start="265.96" dur="3.81">global warming or anything I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="267.55" dur="3.75">about actual devastation pollution that</text>
  <text start="269.77" dur="3.78">kind of stuff with his governments live</text>
  <text start="271.3" dur="4.11">on their debt and yeah it&amp;#39;s no surprise</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="4.86">anyway we don&amp;#39;t need a history lesson or</text>
  <text start="275.41" dur="4.8">anything this is pretty bad and when you</text>
  <text start="278.41" dur="3.51">know if history has been any kind of a</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="1.98">indicator then they&amp;#39;re probably gonna do</text>
  <text start="281.92" dur="4.23">it</text>
  <text start="282.19" dur="6.69">it hasn&amp;#39;t happened yet we also have FBI</text>
  <text start="286.15" dur="5.21">never searching pervert Anthony Weiner&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.88" dur="5.31">laptop until after the 2016 election</text>
  <text start="291.36" dur="7.75">weiners iPad and iPhone are also now</text>
  <text start="294.19" dur="8.93">missing big surprise there as I</text>
  <text start="299.11" dur="10.11">mentioned leprosy in Los Angeles that is</text>
  <text start="303.12" dur="10.03">crazy so they&amp;#39;re saying to fight the</text>
  <text start="309.22" dur="6.48">stigma wow they want the public to fight</text>
  <text start="313.15" dur="4.17">the stigma so I guess be nice to the</text>
  <text start="315.7" dur="3.56">people who have leprosy because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="317.32" dur="3.9">living in piles of shit on the street</text>
  <text start="319.26" dur="3.37">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="321.22" dur="3.51">not literally like laying in the piles</text>
  <text start="322.63" dur="5.25">but they&amp;#39;re near it it creates disease</text>
  <text start="324.73" dur="6.45">it creates a weakened immune system it</text>
  <text start="327.88" dur="5.16">you know basically you know human feces</text>
  <text start="331.18" dur="4.64">is where human disease would would most</text>
  <text start="333.04" dur="6.17">prevalently grow right so it&amp;#39;s targeting</text>
  <text start="335.82" dur="5.62">humans in that kind of a it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="339.21" dur="4.99">kind of a farmer thing I guess if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.44" dur="5.04">near dog poop it&amp;#39;s not as dangerous to</text>
  <text start="344.2" dur="3.69">you as human poop both are unhealthy</text>
  <text start="346.48" dur="3.35">both could carry a lot of germs and</text>
  <text start="347.89" dur="4.47">stuff but but like you carry your own</text>
  <text start="349.83" dur="4.93">parasites like for your own species or</text>
  <text start="352.36" dur="4.5">whatever and that&amp;#39;s where they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="354.76" dur="4.02">host so you&amp;#39;re gonna have all these</text>
  <text start="356.86" dur="5.77">diseases being baked into this like</text>
  <text start="358.78" dur="8.59">steaming pile of you know human stuff</text>
  <text start="362.63" dur="6.57">so anyway it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a sad place these</text>
  <text start="367.37" dur="3.42">days and I would not encourage anyone to</text>
  <text start="369.2" dur="4.95">go there because these diseases can be</text>
  <text start="370.79" dur="5.63">dangerous it&amp;#39;s not just leprosy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.15" dur="4.2">typhus it&amp;#39;s other things of that nature</text>
  <text start="376.42" dur="4.21">it&amp;#39;s nonstop</text>

  <text start="414.23" dur="5.55">you know old Jerry Nadler there is uh</text>
  <text start="417.01" dur="4.6">he&amp;#39;s desperate he&amp;#39;s really really really</text>
  <text start="419.78" dur="3.36">desperate and you can you can always see</text>
  <text start="421.61" dur="3.63">it in his behavior if you watching it</text>
  <text start="423.14" dur="3.87">he&amp;#39;s you know really boring videos of</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="4.05">their interactions and such you know</text>
  <text start="427.01" dur="5.19">sometimes it&amp;#39;ll be fine Laura Loomer</text>
  <text start="429.29" dur="4.59">will bus ten or maybe he has to square</text>
  <text start="432.2" dur="5.04">off with Candace Owens and she corrects</text>
  <text start="433.88" dur="4.98">him right point-blank flat out and</text>
  <text start="437.24" dur="3.93">corrects him on how he was trying to</text>
  <text start="438.86" dur="4.41">like manipulate her words against him</text>
  <text start="441.17" dur="4.38">and he gets flustered and you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="443.27" dur="4.77">really can&amp;#39;t keep up that&amp;#39;s who we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="445.55" dur="5.16">dealing with here I don&amp;#39;t know if you</text>
  <text start="448.04" dur="4.32">guys have seen the set about the noise</text>
  <text start="450.71" dur="3.6">there I don&amp;#39;t know if you guys have seen</text>
  <text start="452.36" dur="5.07">that movie life with Eddie Murphy in it</text>
  <text start="454.31" dur="6.6">but mr. Nadler here reminds me of a</text>
  <text start="457.43" dur="6.24">character cold can&amp;#39;t get right and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.91" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sort of a comical look at</text>
  <text start="463.67" dur="4.02">someone who had sort of a speech</text>
  <text start="465.83" dur="3.84">impediment and I guess partial brain</text>
  <text start="467.69" dur="4.32">damage or something and I certainly</text>
  <text start="469.67" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t mean any disrespect to them but in</text>
  <text start="472.01" dur="5.69">adverse case he just can&amp;#39;t keep up you</text>
  <text start="474.11" dur="7.92">know and that&amp;#39;s that just seems to be</text>
  <text start="477.7" dur="7.63">his legacy lately now we also have Lisa</text>
  <text start="482.03" dur="4.98">May Crowley reporting between Jack for</text>

  <text start="514.43" dur="4.86">made a history of you know pointing out</text>
  <text start="517.01" dur="4.47">fake Naga tactics when I was able and it</text>
  <text start="519.29" dur="5.67">certainly made a couple of enemies for</text>

  <text start="542.27" dur="5.13">always out there kind of building up</text>
  <text start="545.15" dur="4.17">he&amp;#39;ll say really cool things on Twitter</text>
  <text start="547.4" dur="4.2">that you would absolutely agree with 99%</text>
  <text start="549.32" dur="4.92">of time so he gets a big following on</text>
  <text start="551.6" dur="4.71">Twitter and people like his stuff but</text>
  <text start="554.24" dur="3.92">he&amp;#39;s one of those fake manga like when</text>

  <text start="558.16" dur="6.16">changing the narrative and you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="561.74" dur="5.21">also been alleged to have committed some</text>
  <text start="564.32" dur="5.43">making of the news events rather than</text>
  <text start="566.95" dur="5.11">reporting on the news events and if you</text>
  <text start="569.75" dur="4.68">watch this short video here you can find</text>
  <text start="572.06" dur="4.23">it on that website as well or just</text>
  <text start="574.43" dur="5.19">search chat logs on the channel and</text>
  <text start="576.29" dur="6.27">you&amp;#39;ll see plenty more but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="579.62" dur="4.68">quick video kind of going through some</text>
  <text start="582.56" dur="5.76">of that history and proving that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.3" dur="6.3">not only a doctor but a liar and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="588.32" dur="5.91">too many different stories to note when</text>
  <text start="590.6" dur="5.46">it comes to to cue and on itself and you</text>
  <text start="594.23" dur="6">know kind of also important understand</text>
  <text start="596.06" dur="5.76">that at least from what we can see and</text>
  <text start="600.23" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s not the perfect picture or</text>
  <text start="601.82" dur="4.74">anything that looks like an information</text>
  <text start="604.49" dur="4.76">dominance warfare officer so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.56" dur="5.07">trained as a propagandist if that&amp;#39;s true</text>

  <text start="746.64" dur="5.77">so as you guys have known something was</text>
  <text start="750.579" dur="3.901">weird about this case why would he be</text>
  <text start="752.41" dur="3.75">pleading guilty to something that</text>
  <text start="754.48" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;ve even admitted that he didn&amp;#39;t do</text>

  <text start="759.58" dur="4.17">the deep state sort of get him for sure</text>
  <text start="761.5" dur="5.01">it wasn&amp;#39;t so he could lose all of that</text>

  <text start="768.16" dur="4.17">to the general Flynn Defense Fund I</text>
  <text start="769.74" dur="5.05">would argue offense fund at this point</text>

  <text start="781.54" dur="4.35">that that he needs to see for his</text>
  <text start="783.22" dur="4.47">defense all began and the judge told</text>
  <text start="785.89" dur="6.59">them to so this is really winding down</text>
  <text start="787.69" dur="7.89">quite quickly checkmate</text>
  <text start="792.48" dur="6.04">absolutely general Flynn is about to</text>
  <text start="795.58" dur="5.49">have his day and because he did not</text>
  <text start="798.52" dur="5.31">withdraw he actually pled guilty and</text>
  <text start="801.07" dur="6.33">held it for a long time we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="803.83" dur="8.82">actually see this resolved now we also</text>
  <text start="807.4" dur="6.69">have Democrat presidential candidate to</text>
  <text start="812.65" dur="3.99">da guy I&amp;#39;m really bad at this one</text>

  <text start="825.87" dur="4.12">which I guess includes you know after</text>
  <text start="828.19" dur="3.33">you&amp;#39;ve popped them out like perhaps in a</text>

  <text start="842.8" dur="3.21">actually funny I&amp;#39;ve never a lot of</text>
  <text start="844.87" dur="2.34">people don&amp;#39;t know that I didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="846.01" dur="3.24">that it that you could do that at first</text>
  <text start="847.21" dur="3.39">but babies don&amp;#39;t yeah and so anyway it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="849.25" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s funny they can breathe underwater I</text>
  <text start="850.6" dur="6.24">guess for for that time but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="854.29" dur="4.74">weird that he would say such an ignorant</text>
  <text start="856.84" dur="3.54">statement I mean you could almost chunk</text>
  <text start="859.03" dur="2.67">that up to just sort of like being lazy</text>
  <text start="860.38" dur="3.3">about the topic but you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="861.7" dur="5.15">presidential candidate right like you</text>
  <text start="863.68" dur="7.89">have to understand that topic that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="866.85" dur="7.72">anyway let&amp;#39;s watch now they hold</text>
  <text start="871.57" dur="6.15">everybody in line with this one kind of</text>
  <text start="874.57" dur="5.7">piece of doctrine about abortion right</text>
  <text start="877.72" dur="4.02">which is obviously a tough issue for a</text>
  <text start="880.27" dur="4.59">lot of people to think through morally</text>
  <text start="881.74" dur="4.83">then again you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="884.86" dur="4.77">parts of the Bible to talk about how</text>
  <text start="886.57" dur="4.26">life begins with breath and so</text>
  <text start="889.63" dur="3.78">and that is something that we can</text>
  <text start="890.83" dur="5.52">interpret differently and approach or</text>
  <text start="893.41" dur="4.59">pick up me to it but I think no matter</text>
  <text start="896.35" dur="4.32">where you think about the the kind of</text>
  <text start="898" dur="4.59">cosmic question how life begins most</text>
  <text start="900.67" dur="4.53">Americans can get on the board with the</text>
  <text start="902.59" dur="3.99">idea of alright I might draw the line</text>
  <text start="905.2" dur="2.73">here you might draw the line there but</text>
  <text start="906.58" dur="3.06">the most important thing is the person</text>
  <text start="907.93" dur="4.66">who should be drawing the line is the</text>

  <text start="912.59" dur="4.2">no that&amp;#39;s not true at all because if</text>
  <text start="915.32" dur="2.76">that were the case then whoever is the</text>

  <text start="923.3" dur="3.33">that other person that she wanted to</text>
  <text start="925.13" dur="2.94">murder at the time was somehow dependent</text>
  <text start="926.63" dur="3.39">on her at the time like maybe they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="928.07" dur="3.93">the car with her and she&amp;#39;s driving which</text>
  <text start="930.02" dur="4.319">well it&amp;#39;s her body her choice if she can</text>

  <text start="934.339" dur="2.94">you know things and things of this</text>
  <text start="935.51" dur="4.079">nature it&amp;#39;s a stupid ludicrous sort of</text>
