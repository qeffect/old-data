  <text start="130.05" dur="4.53">our first story comes out of Al Jazeera</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="6.089">Iran Zarif hold surprise talks with</text>
  <text start="134.58" dur="5.46">McCone at g7 summit unannounced visit</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="4.59">comes as France ramps us ramps up</text>
  <text start="140.04" dur="6.77">efforts to ease tensions between Iran</text>
  <text start="142.409" dur="7.981">and us over Tehran&amp;#39;s nuclear program so</text>
  <text start="146.81" dur="6.37">imagine you are at a secret meeting</text>
  <text start="150.39" dur="5.86">supposedly well not really secret but</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="5.66">let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re at a private meeting</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="4.599">with some individuals where you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="4.77">to talk about another individual and</text>
  <text start="160.849" dur="4.771">their drug problem for example all of a</text>
  <text start="163.61" dur="7.67">sudden the individual that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="165.62" dur="5.66">talking about shows up unannounced</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="8.8">really awkward now they say that the</text>
  <text start="178.459" dur="4.65">Prime Minister is that Eve his arrival</text>
  <text start="181.25" dur="3.989">was unannounced that they it was a</text>
  <text start="183.109" dur="3.99">surprise but really I don&amp;#39;t think it was</text>
  <text start="185.239" dur="4.53">a surprise especially given the fact</text>
  <text start="187.099" dur="5.661">that he has been apparently having talks</text>
  <text start="189.769" dur="6.47">with McCrone for a while now and</text>
  <text start="192.76" dur="7.42">apparently McCrone had invited him and</text>
  <text start="196.239" dur="7.301">so they had talks on the sidelines so</text>
  <text start="200.18" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re trying to repair salvage what</text>
  <text start="203.54" dur="5.699">they can of the Iran deal now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="206.45" dur="6.869">also making a claim that the United</text>
  <text start="209.239" dur="8.64">States was an approval of this but the</text>
  <text start="213.319" dur="8.67">White House denies it so how can that be</text>
  <text start="217.879" dur="8.19">whoa president Trump completely denies</text>
  <text start="221.989" dur="9.78">knowledge of Iran Saudi even being</text>
  <text start="226.069" dur="9.961">invited to this summit I think that he</text>
  <text start="231.769" dur="7.14">had no idea that this was going to occur</text>
  <text start="236.03" dur="5.31">I think he would not have approved of it</text>
  <text start="238.909" dur="4.351">and I think when they say the United</text>
  <text start="241.34" dur="4.5">States had approved of it what they</text>
  <text start="243.26" dur="5.28">really mean is that individuals within</text>
  <text start="245.84" dur="8.67">the United States deep state shadow</text>
  <text start="248.54" dur="9.36">government had approved of this because</text>
  <text start="254.51" dur="7.259">those individuals would like to see the</text>
  <text start="257.9" dur="6.44">Iran deal salvaged even though it was a</text>
  <text start="261.769" dur="2.571">bad deal</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="5.26">now it&amp;#39;s also no surprise that Angela</text>
  <text start="267.38" dur="5.849">Merkel was also in agreement with this</text>
  <text start="269.81" dur="8.13">meeting saying that it was a good thing</text>
  <text start="273.229" dur="7.44">that they were having talks no surprise</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="7.65">at all because as soon as President</text>
  <text start="280.669" dur="7.211">Trump had scrapped the Iran deal these</text>
  <text start="285.59" dur="5.22">leaders had</text>
  <text start="287.88" dur="6.66">we made a trip to the United States</text>
  <text start="290.81" dur="5.62">practically begging President Trump to</text>
  <text start="294.54" dur="10.52">come back to the table with the Iran</text>
  <text start="296.43" dur="14.58">deal they need this so is it a surprise</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="10.74">no is it in bad form yeah but not a</text>
  <text start="311.01" dur="11.16">surprise at all okay in other news</text>
  <text start="315.8" dur="8.26">tucker carlson was talking about the</text>
  <text start="322.17" dur="4.08">college admissions scandal and he said</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="4.98">that this scandal could bring down</text>
  <text start="326.25" dur="5.13">Barack Obama now well I will agree that</text>
  <text start="329.04" dur="4.56">the college admissions scandal is huge</text>
  <text start="331.38" dur="7.26">and they should look at it very closely</text>
  <text start="333.6" dur="7.92">and everyone who is possibly involved in</text>
  <text start="338.64" dur="5.04">that I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll be what brings</text>
  <text start="341.52" dur="4.53">down Barack Obama in fact I think that</text>
  <text start="343.68" dur="5.7">what will bring down Barack Obama is the</text>
  <text start="346.05" dur="6.39">FISA abuse scandal and I&amp;#39;ll be waiting</text>
  <text start="349.38" dur="8.07">for that okay so in this one he talks</text>
  <text start="352.44" dur="8.37">about how in college admissions it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.45" dur="6.66">really just unregulated lobbying at a</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="6.42">very high level so you have individuals</text>
  <text start="364.11" dur="5.19">who are related to high level Democrats</text>
  <text start="367.23" dur="4.05">now he doesn&amp;#39;t talk about Hollywood</text>
  <text start="369.3" dur="3.78">celebrities here but of course they are</text>
  <text start="371.28" dur="3.75">involved in this too they do the same</text>
  <text start="373.08" dur="4.64">thing but he was talking about and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="375.03" dur="7.53">sure Republicans do it as well</text>
  <text start="377.72" dur="9.04">crooked rich leaders do this it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="8.1">limited to just Democrats so he was</text>
  <text start="386.76" dur="8.16">talking about how Democrat leaders</text>
  <text start="390.66" dur="6.06">Democrat politicians will pay for their</text>
  <text start="394.92" dur="6.3">children to get into certain colleges</text>
  <text start="396.72" dur="8.66">Ivy League including Harvard Brown Yale</text>
  <text start="401.22" dur="7.02">these supposedly highly selective</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="5.08">colleges that are very hard to get into</text>
  <text start="408.24" dur="5.61">and I say selective very loosely here</text>
  <text start="410.46" dur="8.73">because if you have the cash you can get</text>
  <text start="413.85" dur="6.95">in so he mentioned that a lot of these</text>
  <text start="419.19" dur="4.34">individuals who may</text>
  <text start="420.8" dur="5.369">into these colleges who are related to</text>
  <text start="423.53" dur="4.59">high-level Democrats they are fairly</text>
  <text start="426.169" dur="4.771">average there&amp;#39;s nothing spectacular</text>
  <text start="428.12" dur="7.109">about their academic record or they</text>
  <text start="430.94" dur="6.689">their athletic ability whatsoever so as</text>
  <text start="435.229" dur="5.761">high schoolers they perform on an</text>
  <text start="437.629" dur="5.731">average level so how are they getting</text>
  <text start="440.99" dur="4.62">into these highly selective schools well</text>
  <text start="443.36" dur="4.89">because they&amp;#39;re family members who are</text>
  <text start="445.61" dur="4.41">high level Democrats don&amp;#39;t eat tens of</text>
  <text start="448.25" dur="4.849">thousands and sometimes hundreds of</text>
  <text start="450.02" dur="5.97">thousands of dollars to the University</text>
  <text start="453.099" dur="5.921">so of course the university is going to</text>
  <text start="455.99" dur="6.149">get priority to those individuals who</text>
  <text start="459.02" dur="8.94">are related to people who may benefit</text>
  <text start="462.139" dur="8.701">their facility and of course he</text>
  <text start="467.96" dur="4.919">mentioned specifically Al Gore here too</text>
  <text start="470.84" dur="4.579">because Al Gore all four of his children</text>
  <text start="472.879" dur="6.63">had made it into Harvard even though</text>
  <text start="475.419" dur="9.06">they were average high schoolers so how</text>
  <text start="479.509" dur="8.371">on earth does even one let alone four of</text>
  <text start="484.479" dur="7.481">his children get into Harvard when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="487.88" dur="6.779">supposed to be selective so this is a</text>
  <text start="491.96" dur="5.489">big problem because you have very</text>
  <text start="494.659" dur="4.62">qualified individuals who don&amp;#39;t make it</text>
  <text start="497.449" dur="5.25">because there&amp;#39;s not enough room so you</text>
  <text start="499.279" dur="6.301">have someone who has an excellent</text>
  <text start="502.699" dur="5.701">academic record has excellent athletic</text>
  <text start="505.58" dur="4.92">ability is well-rounded with community</text>
  <text start="508.4" dur="3.509">service in all of this but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="510.5" dur="3">make it because there are not enough</text>
  <text start="511.909" dur="3.451">seats well there&amp;#39;s not enough seats</text>
  <text start="513.5" dur="5.209">because they&amp;#39;re already taken by</text>
  <text start="515.36" dur="7.95">individuals who paid their way in</text>
  <text start="518.709" dur="7.24">because it&amp;#39;s about the status symbol</text>
  <text start="523.31" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s associated with being a Harvard</text>
  <text start="525.949" dur="7.221">graduate being a Yale graduate being a</text>
  <text start="528.38" dur="4.79">graduate of any Ivy League university</text>
  <text start="533.199" dur="7.57">there&amp;#39;s a certain status that comes</text>
  <text start="535.459" dur="8.37">along with that so this is a big deal</text>
  <text start="540.769" dur="5.31">and should not be allowed you should</text>
  <text start="543.829" dur="6.421">make it into a college based on merit</text>
  <text start="546.079" dur="6.75">not because you paid your way in and of</text>
  <text start="550.25" dur="4.08">course one of the more famous figures in</text>
  <text start="552.829" dur="4.201">this whole College Admissions</text>
  <text start="554.33" dur="4.5">is Lori Loughlin why because she may be</text>
  <text start="557.03" dur="5.25">held accountable for this now of course</text>
  <text start="558.83" dur="6.9">she does say recently that of course</text>
  <text start="562.28" dur="6.54">she&amp;#39;s going to be exonerated but that</text>
  <text start="565.73" dur="8.07">seems to be what the guilty say lately</text>
  <text start="568.82" dur="6.66">for example Michael avenatti Michael</text>
  <text start="573.8" dur="6.21">avinasi said that he was going to be</text>
  <text start="575.48" dur="7.02">exonerated as well now she thinks she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.01" dur="8.46">gonna be exonerated why because of her</text>
  <text start="582.5" dur="8.34">position she&amp;#39;s a celebrity she has the</text>
  <text start="588.47" dur="8.79">means right she thinks she is</text>
  <text start="590.84" dur="8.04">untouchable because of her status now</text>
  <text start="597.26" dur="4.5">her daughter&amp;#39;s had gotten into a</text>
  <text start="598.88" dur="6.72">university based on an athletic</text>
  <text start="601.76" dur="6.96">scholarship for rowing even though they</text>
  <text start="605.6" dur="11.28">had no experience in rowing whatsoever</text>
  <text start="608.72" dur="10.23">they had never rowed for a team ever so</text>
  <text start="616.88" dur="7.04">how did they get in oh because she paid</text>
  <text start="618.95" dur="4.97">half a million dollars to get them in</text>
  <text start="625.51" dur="5.86">that&amp;#39;s how so she&amp;#39;s not going to get</text>
  <text start="629.75" dur="3.6">away with this she thinks she&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="631.37" dur="5.16">but she&amp;#39;s not and I hope this sets a</text>
  <text start="633.35" dur="5.13">precedent because we cannot allow this</text>
  <text start="636.53" dur="5.01">to happen they influence our politics</text>
  <text start="638.48" dur="5.79">lobbying does and now it influences who</text>
  <text start="641.54" dur="8.01">gets into a high-level college and who</text>
  <text start="644.27" dur="10.08">does not this is not okay</text>
  <text start="649.55" dur="5.88">all right now the story I really want to</text>
  <text start="654.35" dur="2.79">talk about and I&amp;#39;m gonna make this a</text>
  <text start="655.43" dur="3.63">little bit short today it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="657.14" dur="4.23">be as long as usual because I still want</text>
  <text start="659.06" dur="4.29">to do a lot more digging on this but I</text>
  <text start="661.37" dur="4.68">just want to give a basic overview of</text>
  <text start="663.35" dur="6.75">what&amp;#39;s going on here so we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="666.05" dur="7.2">about how modelling agencies are a cover</text>
  <text start="670.1" dur="6.24">for sex trafficking and I mention that</text>
  <text start="673.25" dur="5.34">because of Rachel Chandler&amp;#39;s connections</text>
  <text start="676.34" dur="5.58">and of course we looked at her and she</text>
  <text start="678.59" dur="7.1">has a modeling agency and of course she</text>
  <text start="681.92" dur="6.21">had made this discovery of the top</text>
  <text start="685.69" dur="5.68">models for 2016</text>
  <text start="688.13" dur="8.12">remember them they look like battered</text>
  <text start="691.37" dur="9.08">runaways underaged battered runaways</text>
  <text start="696.25" dur="7.12">also she&amp;#39;s been linked to Epstein and</text>
  <text start="700.45" dur="7.87">Bill Clinton she was on the Lolita</text>
  <text start="703.37" dur="6.87">Express with Bill Clinton now also in</text>
  <text start="708.32" dur="5.34">the modeling world we have jean-luc</text>
  <text start="710.24" dur="7.38">Brunel jean-luc Brunel is a major figure</text>
  <text start="713.66" dur="8.52">in this whole scandal so we need to be</text>
  <text start="717.62" dur="6.69">looking at him very closely so jean-luc</text>
  <text start="722.18" dur="3.78">Brunel was the one who is named in a</text>
  <text start="724.31" dur="3.24">statement by Virginia Roberts and</text>
  <text start="725.96" dur="3.09">Virginia Roberts had me the clean that</text>
  <text start="727.55" dur="3.42">she was forced to have sex with John</text>
  <text start="729.05" dur="4.23">Luke Brunel she also said that she</text>
  <text start="730.97" dur="5.06">witnessed jean-luc Brunel have sex with</text>
  <text start="733.28" dur="5.85">several other underage girls also</text>
  <text start="736.03" dur="5.32">additionally besides the Epstein scandal</text>
  <text start="739.13" dur="5.64">over the years there have been several</text>
  <text start="741.35" dur="8.37">allegations of sexual abuse of models by</text>
  <text start="744.77" dur="7.05">jean-luc Brunel so this is not a unique</text>
  <text start="749.72" dur="4.11">thing where all of a sudden he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="751.82" dur="6">associated with Epstein and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="753.83" dur="8.49">the abuse was no four years and so he is</text>
  <text start="757.82" dur="7.02">the co-founder of mc2 now who financed</text>
  <text start="762.32" dur="4.29">the founding of mc2 it was epsteen</text>
  <text start="764.84" dur="6.38">epsteen dumped the money into that</text>
  <text start="766.61" dur="7.56">agency so he formed mc2 modeling agency</text>
  <text start="771.22" dur="5.98">now jean-luc Brunel was also involved in</text>
  <text start="774.17" dur="5.13">other modeling agencies besides mc2 and</text>
  <text start="777.2" dur="4.83">I&amp;#39;ll get into that in just a minute</text>
  <text start="779.3" dur="7.59">but I want to focus on mc2 just for a</text>
  <text start="782.03" dur="6.96">second so Victoria Secret Leslie Wexner</text>
  <text start="786.89" dur="5.13">he is trying to distance himself from</text>
  <text start="788.99" dur="5.25">Jeffrey Epstein but really he cannot</text>
  <text start="792.02" dur="4.98">distance himself from this scandal</text>
  <text start="794.24" dur="6.84">so we&amp;#39;ve already established that mc2</text>
  <text start="797" dur="7.5">was funded largely by Epstein and that</text>
  <text start="801.08" dur="5.7">Epstein had used the models from mc2 and</text>
  <text start="804.5" dur="4.56">in fact John Maloof Brunel according to</text>
  <text start="806.78" dur="3.87">court documents had housed young models</text>
  <text start="809.06" dur="5.88">at Epstein&amp;#39;s mansions</text>
  <text start="810.65" dur="7.439">so Victoria&amp;#39;s Secret owned by Leslie</text>
  <text start="814.94" dur="5.31">Wexner has reportedly continued to work</text>
  <text start="818.089" dur="3.351">with mc2 after it was accused of</text>
  <text start="820.25" dur="6.89">supplying underage</text>
  <text start="821.44" dur="8.46">- Jeffrey Epstein no surprise there no</text>
  <text start="827.14" dur="6.27">surprise especially since one of the</text>
  <text start="829.9" dur="6.15">accusers we know now had been an</text>
  <text start="833.41" dur="5.48">aspiring Victoria&amp;#39;s Secret model but she</text>
  <text start="836.05" dur="7.68">was referred to Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s house</text>
  <text start="838.89" dur="8.29">why all right it&amp;#39;s not just Victoria&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="843.73" dur="6.27">Secret so who else uses mc2 models major</text>
  <text start="847.18" dur="8.06">mainstream retailers including nerdstrom</text>
  <text start="850" dur="8.73">Macy&amp;#39;s and JC Penney all of them using</text>
  <text start="855.24" dur="6.42">mc2 models these are models that have</text>
  <text start="858.73" dur="6.18">been known to have been sex trafficked</text>
  <text start="861.66" dur="7.96">modeling is a cover for sex trafficking</text>
  <text start="864.91" dur="8.58">it&amp;#39;s basically advertisement all right</text>
  <text start="869.62" dur="7.73">now I dug a little bit into the origins</text>
  <text start="873.49" dur="7.59">of modeling and one of the first major</text>
  <text start="877.35" dur="7.44">modeling agencies was formed by Gerrard</text>
  <text start="881.08" dur="7.92">Ford and Eileen Ford and so they formed</text>
  <text start="884.79" dur="8.14">Ford&amp;#39;s models in Manhattan New York City</text>
  <text start="889" dur="7.02">in their apartment now who worked with</text>
  <text start="892.93" dur="9.33">Eileen Ford Jean Luc Brunel the same guy</text>
  <text start="896.02" dur="9.09">who later ended up founding mc2 now who</text>
  <text start="902.26" dur="4.71">carried on the Ford models legacy well</text>
  <text start="905.11" dur="6.3">that would be their daughter Katie Ford</text>
  <text start="906.97" dur="9.3">now Katie Ford also has a philanthropy</text>
  <text start="911.41" dur="9.56">organization and at this point we talked</text>
  <text start="916.27" dur="7.65">about how philanthropy is usually just</text>
  <text start="920.97" dur="7.24">it&amp;#39;s really a cover for malicious</text>
  <text start="923.92" dur="7.52">activity so she has an organization</text>
  <text start="928.21" dur="6.06">called free the slaves and she also has</text>
  <text start="931.44" dur="4.81">attended the UN human trafficking</text>
  <text start="934.27" dur="4.44">conference and has presented her work</text>
  <text start="936.25" dur="5.46">there so she&amp;#39;s worked with the UN and in</text>
  <text start="938.71" dur="5.07">fact her organization works in Ghana as</text>
  <text start="941.71" dur="7.47">well as Haiti and we all know it goes on</text>
  <text start="943.78" dur="7.59">at Haiti so free the slaves is supposed</text>
  <text start="949.18" dur="6.22">to be an organization that works against</text>
  <text start="951.37" dur="7.39">human trafficking well at this point</text>
  <text start="955.4" dur="5.55">we know that these organizations that</text>
  <text start="958.76" dur="5.45">supposedly work against sex trafficking</text>
  <text start="960.95" dur="6.72">they are perpetuating it themselves and</text>
  <text start="964.21" dur="7.6">that their organization again is really</text>
  <text start="967.67" dur="8.669">just the coat of benevolence it&amp;#39;s a wolf</text>
  <text start="971.81" dur="6.54">in sheep&amp;#39;s clothing so Katy Ford</text>
  <text start="976.339" dur="3.961">carrying on the legacy of her parents</text>
  <text start="978.35" dur="6.5">who worked with John Luke Brunel who has</text>
  <text start="980.3" dur="8.96">been known to sex traffic young models</text>
  <text start="984.85" dur="6.61">also Rachel Chandler worked for mc2 and</text>
  <text start="989.26" dur="4.95">Rachael Chandler also worked for</text>
  <text start="991.46" dur="8.31">Ghislaine Maxwell who was the madam of</text>
  <text start="994.21" dur="9.25">Jeffrey Epstein so really what we need</text>
  <text start="999.77" dur="4.86">to be looking at now and going over with</text>
  <text start="1003.46" dur="4.65">a fine-tooth comb</text>
  <text start="1004.63" dur="5.7">are these modeling agencies that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="1008.11" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s at because here&amp;#39;s the thing oh and</text>
  <text start="1010.33" dur="3.93">also another interesting thing about</text>
  <text start="1011.65" dur="6.96">Rachel Chandler she&amp;#39;s actually Rachel</text>
  <text start="1014.26" dur="8.04">Chandler Guinness married to the heir of</text>
  <text start="1018.61" dur="6.9">Guinness beer also she&amp;#39;s friends with</text>
  <text start="1022.3" dur="4.019">the niece of the broth mints the</text>
  <text start="1025.51" dur="5.78">Brockman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1026.319" dur="8.071">are connected to nexium so is nexium</text>
  <text start="1031.29" dur="4.12">separate from the Epstein sex</text>
  <text start="1034.39" dur="7.13">trafficking Network</text>
  <text start="1035.41" dur="8.539">I don&amp;#39;t think so they&amp;#39;re all the same</text>
  <text start="1041.52" dur="5.26">Epstein is not the head of it</text>
  <text start="1043.949" dur="7.001">Keith Ranieri is not the head of it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1046.78" dur="6.54">Jean Loup Brunel is not either but Jean</text>
  <text start="1050.95" dur="4.77">Luc Brunel is a significant figure and</text>
  <text start="1053.32" dur="5.28">so we need to be looking at him very</text>
  <text start="1055.72" dur="5.87">closely now right now no one knows where</text>
  <text start="1058.6" dur="7.5">he is he is apparently in hiding now</text>
  <text start="1061.59" dur="7.48">allegedly authorities in the u.s. are</text>
  <text start="1066.1" dur="6.27">trying to put together charges against</text>
  <text start="1069.07" dur="7.08">Jean Luc Brunel now Fox have reported on</text>
  <text start="1072.37" dur="5.4">this and they had said that the Chargers</text>
  <text start="1076.15" dur="4.13">likely would not stick they probably</text>
  <text start="1077.77" dur="5.94">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to extradite him unless</text>
  <text start="1080.28" dur="5.47">the country where he is based also</text>
  <text start="1083.71" dur="5.2">thinks that what he has done is a crime</text>
  <text start="1085.75" dur="5.53">now I do think that this is like</text>
  <text start="1088.91" dur="3.3">seeing&amp;#39;s how france has also come out</text>
  <text start="1091.28" dur="3.029">and made a statement</text>
  <text start="1092.21" dur="3.839">so authorities there are also looking at</text>
  <text start="1094.309" dur="6.271">the Epstein scandal and they said they</text>
  <text start="1096.049" dur="6.841">will be looking at residents citizens of</text>
  <text start="1100.58" dur="4.62">France as well and that includes Jean</text>
  <text start="1102.89" dur="4.289">Luc Bernal so if they find that Jean Luc</text>
  <text start="1105.2" dur="4.29">Brunel is guilty then it will be</text>
  <text start="1107.179" dur="5.13">possible for the United States to</text>
  <text start="1109.49" dur="4.71">extradite him well once he&amp;#39;s found</text>
  <text start="1112.309" dur="6.181">because right now no one knows where he</text>
  <text start="1114.2" dur="6.21">is okay well that&amp;#39;s all I have for today</text>
  <text start="1118.49" dur="3.929">I just wanted to touch on this a little</text>
