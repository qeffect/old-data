  <text start="180.819" dur="5.821">basically and so I wanna know what is Q</text>
  <text start="184.239" dur="4.14">saying what is kidnap the Cavanaugh&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="186.64" dur="3.989">place people are talking about military</text>
  <text start="188.379" dur="4.321">tribunals people are talking about you</text>
  <text start="190.629" dur="3.69">know people moving from the Democrat to</text>
  <text start="192.7" dur="4.069">the Republican Party to support Trump</text>
  <text start="194.319" dur="7.681">they want to see justice being served</text>
  <text start="196.769" dur="7.03">what is Q now saying okay so obviously</text>
  <text start="202" dur="3.959">for a while now he&amp;#39;s been kind of</text>
  <text start="203.799" dur="5.131">building up to this the Cavanaugh</text>
  <text start="205.959" dur="4.56">situation he even looked he kind of let</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="3.66">us know that they were willing to back</text>
  <text start="210.519" dur="5.011">off Cavanaugh in order to not have the</text>
  <text start="212.59" dur="4.829">FISA Declassified and then you know</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="4.139">basically Trump&amp;#39;s response to that was</text>
  <text start="217.419" dur="4.081">we&amp;#39;re gonna get both and now it looks</text>
  <text start="219.669" dur="4.021">like we&amp;#39;ve got Cavanaugh in and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.5" dur="4.5">just moving ahead I&amp;#39;ve been predicting</text>
  <text start="223.69" dur="4.199">for a while you know because of the</text>
  <text start="226" dur="4.29">optics because you can only have we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.889" dur="4.981">kind of a one party or one topic at a</text>
  <text start="230.29" dur="4.5">time country people we had distracted</text>
  <text start="232.87" dur="5.85">too easily so rather than get distracted</text>
  <text start="234.79" dur="6.9">by the FISA we focused on Cavanaugh we</text>
  <text start="238.72" dur="4.65">put the face off Cavanaugh is now in so</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="3.72">I predicted for a while now that right</text>
  <text start="243.37" dur="4.92">after Cavanaugh was in it&amp;#39;s gonna be the</text>
  <text start="245.41" dur="4.68">FISA and that&amp;#39;s coming up you know he</text>
  <text start="248.29" dur="3.93">already started the process when he told</text>
  <text start="250.09" dur="4.859">him to do it then they said basically no</text>
  <text start="252.22" dur="4.769">and then kicked it over to Horowitz he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254.949" dur="5.13">supposed to be doing a speedy process of</text>
  <text start="256.989" dur="5.55">getting the declassification ready and</text>
  <text start="260.079" dur="4.981">then that&amp;#39;s kind of a it counteracts</text>
  <text start="262.539" dur="4.531">their their excuse that Trump is just</text>
  <text start="265.06" dur="3.42">doing this to play politics and ever</text>
  <text start="267.07" dur="5.22">thing else cuz he&amp;#39;s kind of a neutral</text>
  <text start="268.48" dur="5.67">third party and he&amp;#39;s gonna you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="272.29" dur="3.42">gonna sign off on whatever files come</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="4.11">out making sure that there&amp;#39;s no national</text>
  <text start="275.71" dur="4.53">security or you know means and methods</text>
  <text start="278.26" dur="4.47">that kind of stuff being put at risk and</text>
  <text start="280.24" dur="4.29">then when the timing is right and you</text>
  <text start="282.73" dur="3.54">know I&amp;#39;m I was thinking it would be</text>
  <text start="284.53" dur="5.01">within 48 hours if Cavanaugh being put</text>
  <text start="286.27" dur="4.41">in so I&amp;#39;m a little bit behind but the</text>
  <text start="289.54" dur="3.71">timing will be right they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="5.94">release the FISA and then we already see</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="5.02">James Baker rolling on the FBI and then</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="3.39">we see Rosenstein backing out of a</text>
  <text start="298.27" dur="4.26">testimony that he was supposed to go to</text>
  <text start="300.01" dur="4.08">so he&amp;#39;s getting nervous I think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.53" dur="2.76">kind of daring Trump to fire him because</text>
  <text start="304.09" dur="3.57">that&amp;#39;s really all at this point that</text>
  <text start="305.29" dur="3.81">they have they just hope that Trump does</text>
  <text start="307.66" dur="4.11">something that they can pretend he was</text>
  <text start="309.1" dur="4.14">the aggressor every movement they make</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re gonna attack and pounce on</text>
  <text start="313.24" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re looking for they&amp;#39;re desperate so</text>
  <text start="315.07" dur="4.98">you know what what does Q Singh&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="316.99" dur="5.07">happen next what is his his bombshells</text>
  <text start="320.05" dur="3.48">that he&amp;#39;s put forward what we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="322.06" dur="4.26">about the desperate thing real fast did</text>
  <text start="323.53" dur="4.11">you see the after the FBI kind of</text>
  <text start="326.32" dur="2.93">vindicated with that little mini</text>
  <text start="327.64" dur="5.4">investigation</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="5.86">Schumer and fines team came out and</text>
  <text start="333.04" dur="3.78">Feinstein&amp;#39;s face in the background like</text>
  <text start="335.11" dur="4.95">her body language you could tell she was</text>
  <text start="336.82" dur="4.68">just so afraid nervous and she was just</text>
  <text start="340.06" dur="3.48">looking down and she kept getting</text>
  <text start="341.5" dur="4.17">distracted and and you could tell that</text>
  <text start="343.54" dur="4.32">she&amp;#39;s just at her wits end she has no</text>
  <text start="345.67" dur="6.69">idea what&amp;#39;s going on next she is out of</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="6.24">options well but they the the attack</text>
  <text start="352.36" dur="3.12">they did on Kevin on what they do was a</text>
  <text start="354.1" dur="2.88">clown act they should have come up with</text>
  <text start="355.48" dur="3.45">something better they were expecting the</text>
  <text start="356.98" dur="4.5">other side to fold faster so he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="358.93" dur="6.93">have to act out this this amateurish</text>
  <text start="361.48" dur="6.75">show so it&amp;#39;s really desperation but the</text>
  <text start="365.86" dur="4.53">market is all that God is a tool and</text>
  <text start="368.23" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re starting to collapse that do you</text>
  <text start="370.39" dur="4.56">think that they&amp;#39;re gonna hit that hard</text>
  <text start="371.8" dur="5.55">before midterms it&amp;#39;s interesting because</text>
  <text start="374.95" dur="5.16">you know we&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of Trump</text>
  <text start="377.35" dur="4.56">attacking the Fed lately and the Fed</text>
  <text start="380.11" dur="3.69">raising the rates and then Trump calling</text>
  <text start="381.91" dur="4.38">them crazy and and saying that they were</text>
  <text start="383.8" dur="4.95">he we expected an easy money Fed not an</text>
  <text start="386.29" dur="4.5">interest rate fed and kind of blaming</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="3.45">everything on them and I&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="390.79" dur="2.4">for a while I mean the collapse could</text>
  <text start="392.2" dur="2.7">happen this month</text>
  <text start="393.19" dur="3.44">it can happen sometime in the next year</text>
  <text start="394.9" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s not gonna go much longer than that</text>
  <text start="396.63" dur="4.03">you know and that&amp;#39;s just my personal</text>
  <text start="399.22" dur="3.54">opinion that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m basing</text>
  <text start="400.66" dur="4.11">my finance is on I&amp;#39;m trying to get there</text>
  <text start="402.76" dur="3.93">it won&amp;#39;t be Trump&amp;#39;s fault if the whole</text>
  <text start="404.77" dur="5.16">thing collapses but I think they can</text>
  <text start="406.69" dur="5.46">hold it for a long time yet I mean they</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="4.83">can&amp;#39;t hold it forever MIT did a study</text>
  <text start="412.15" dur="3.87">and just by diluting the dollar it will</text>
  <text start="414.76" dur="3.3">collapse on its own no matter what</text>
  <text start="416.02" dur="5.28">anyone does in like twenty thirty one</text>
  <text start="418.06" dur="6.84">something like that but so how long can</text>
  <text start="421.3" dur="5.16">they they hold it can they hold it until</text>
  <text start="424.9" dur="6.78">it just completely collapses on its own</text>
  <text start="426.46" dur="8.01">or you know typically I would say sure</text>
  <text start="431.68" dur="4.62">but in this case the world is basically</text>
  <text start="434.47" dur="3.48">as a whole moving away from the petro</text>
  <text start="436.3" dur="4.02">dollar I mean they&amp;#39;re abandoning it left</text>
  <text start="437.95" dur="4.32">and right they&amp;#39;re choosing to not do</text>
  <text start="440.32" dur="3.39">business with the dollar anymore well</text>
  <text start="442.27" dur="3.96">they want to get out before it collapse</text>
  <text start="443.71" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s going to class but win and they all</text>
  <text start="446.23" dur="6.78">want to plan before it does that yeah at</text>
  <text start="449.41" dur="5.91">the same point we have all of this</text>
  <text start="453.01" dur="3.96">turbulence over here we have to trade</text>
  <text start="455.32" dur="3.96">war heating up that&amp;#39;s gonna kind of</text>
  <text start="456.97" dur="5.01">raise the stakes a little bit more and</text>
  <text start="459.28" dur="4.4">we have to still a term from Mike</text>
  <text start="461.98" dur="4.17">Maloney and others the everything bubble</text>
  <text start="463.68" dur="5.01">reaching peak craziness I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="466.15" dur="5.55">talking you know peak Internet bubble</text>
  <text start="468.69" dur="4.93">dot-com bubble craziness or worse well</text>
  <text start="471.7" dur="3.87">but is that inflation do you think</text>
  <text start="473.62" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s just really I think that&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="475.57" dur="4.02">is all of the inflation that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="477.7" dur="3.57">been money printing left and right Lee</text>
  <text start="479.59" dur="3.9">goes to the top people and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="481.27" dur="3.57">that money then goes into stock buybacks</text>
  <text start="483.49" dur="4.23">and things like that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="484.84" dur="4.92">necessarily raising the values for</text>
  <text start="487.72" dur="3.449">people they&amp;#39;re just trying to buy up</text>
  <text start="489.76" dur="3.18">more assets that&amp;#39;s what the rich people</text>
  <text start="491.169" dur="3.661">do when they have free money they just</text>
  <text start="492.94" dur="3.12">buy up more assets or stock buybacks and</text>
  <text start="494.83" dur="3.24">things like that and all of these things</text>
  <text start="496.06" dur="4.38">all of these bubbles have reached peak</text>
  <text start="498.07" dur="3.87">insanity and they&amp;#39;re you know the stock</text>
  <text start="500.44" dur="3.39">market is not really based on any kind</text>
  <text start="501.94" dur="3.84">of fundamentals anymore it&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="503.83" dur="3.54">based on the income many of these</text>
  <text start="505.78" dur="3.54">companies don&amp;#39;t even have income and</text>
  <text start="507.37" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re still getting huge valuations</text>
  <text start="509.32" dur="5.82">and just all for the possibility of</text>
  <text start="511.36" dur="5.67">income down the road in there it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="515.14" dur="3.57">a big scammy system it&amp;#39;s falling apart</text>
  <text start="517.03" dur="3.24">that everything bubble is popping</text>
  <text start="518.71" dur="3.57">already if you&amp;#39;re starting to if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="520.27" dur="3.78">paying attention the stocks and bonds</text>
  <text start="522.28" dur="3.45">are under a heavy strain the real estate</text>

  <text start="864.37" dur="4.139">that&amp;#39;s not even happening yet so we</text>
  <text start="866.92" dur="3.12">probably won&amp;#39;t be before that that we</text>
  <text start="868.509" dur="3.3">see mass roundups and arrests or</text>

  <text start="886.15" dur="3.76">everybody&amp;#39;s probably seen that at this</text>
  <text start="888.05" dur="4.5">point but he was basically clarifying</text>
  <text start="889.91" dur="4.32">real simple for everybody to understand</text>
  <text start="892.55" dur="3.57">that if you&amp;#39;re a traitor you don&amp;#39;t get</text>

  <text start="897.46" dur="4.78">agree with it or not this is Patriot Act</text>
  <text start="899.96" dur="3.72">kind of stuff but Cavanaugh supports</text>
  <text start="902.24" dur="3.48">that position which means that we</text>
  <text start="903.68" dur="3.99">probably have a strong case at the</text>
  <text start="905.72" dur="3.84">Supreme Court level that when the mass</text>
  <text start="907.67" dur="4.14">arrests happen they will be backed by</text>

  <text start="911.81" dur="7.86">the mass RS happens the clueless masses</text>
  <text start="915.56" dur="6.18">will be angry and there&amp;#39;ll be a lot of</text>

  <text start="1813.7" dur="3.54">whatever you want to call it it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1815.23" dur="4.05">Democrat Republicans not exactly</text>
  <text start="1817.24" dur="3.99">accurate and we&amp;#39;re just getting a habit</text>
  <text start="1819.28" dur="4.41">of using it but we don&amp;#39;t know what else</text>
  <text start="1821.23" dur="4.47">to say that&amp;#39;s the problem go ahead yeah</text>
  <text start="1823.69" dur="3.15">they identify with the Democrat Party so</text>
  <text start="1825.7" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re the biggest problem right now</text>
  <text start="1826.84" dur="5.49">but the Republicans of the old RINO</text>
  <text start="1828.79" dur="5.52">style are bad too so the mob mentality</text>
  <text start="1832.33" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s not something that can be</text>
  <text start="1834.31" dur="4.98">controlled it can only be directed so</text>
  <text start="1837.43" dur="3.27">they don&amp;#39;t have the kind of control that</text>
  <text start="1839.29" dur="3.96">sometimes people think that they have</text>
  <text start="1840.7" dur="4.08">over the anti-shah folks all that they</text>
  <text start="1843.25" dur="2.88">can do that&amp;#39;s why they have to do these</text>
  <text start="1844.78" dur="3.33">false flags that&amp;#39;s why they have to play</text>
  <text start="1846.13" dur="3.18">these victim games because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1848.11" dur="3.06">just tell them what to do they have to</text>
  <text start="1849.31" dur="3.39">manipulate their emotions they have to</text>
  <text start="1851.17" dur="4.74">kind of steer them in a certain</text>
  <text start="1852.7" dur="5.19">direction well same with the masses of</text>
  <text start="1855.91" dur="4.59">the Republicans I mean they&amp;#39;re not all</text>
  <text start="1857.89" dur="3.75">that key then either yeah so I mean</text>
  <text start="1860.5" dur="3.93">really when you&amp;#39;re when you&amp;#39;re dealing</text>
  <text start="1861.64" dur="5.4">with the mob you have to manipulate and</text>
  <text start="1864.43" dur="4.92">steer you can&amp;#39;t control so people that</text>
  <text start="1867.04" dur="5.46">are in the know that their higher levels</text>
  <text start="1869.35" dur="4.8">can only try to manipulate and steer the</text>
  <text start="1872.5" dur="4.11">mob in certain directions to try to</text>
  <text start="1874.15" dur="4.35">either delay or buy them time or</text>
  <text start="1876.61" dur="5.25">negotiate through political power things</text>
  <text start="1878.5" dur="6.72">like that but they can&amp;#39;t control what</text>
  <text start="1881.86" dur="4.68">the mob thinks so you know some people</text>
  <text start="1885.22" dur="2.64">think that they just have outright mind</text>
  <text start="1886.54" dur="2.88">control and that&amp;#39;s not quite the case</text>
  <text start="1887.86" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re just manipulating and then</text>
  <text start="1889.42" dur="4.38">people like McCabe or others who maybe</text>
  <text start="1891.16" dur="5.58">know what&amp;#39;s going on they they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1893.8" dur="4.83">just you know share that with everybody</text>
  <text start="1896.74" dur="3.54">they have to try to just manipulate them</text>
  <text start="1898.63" dur="4.8">into doing stupid things that help their</text>
  <text start="1900.28" dur="5.67">case somehow and directly what sounds</text>
  <text start="1903.43" dur="4.98">like things really are moving forward in</text>
  <text start="1905.95" dur="5.4">a logical meaningful way now one thing</text>
  <text start="1908.41" dur="5.13">that I heard that I thought about is</text>
  <text start="1911.35" dur="4.83">that as so many made a comment and I was</text>
  <text start="1913.54" dur="5.13">like wow that could be has it ever</text>
