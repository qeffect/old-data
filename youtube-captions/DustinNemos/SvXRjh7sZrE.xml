  <text start="236.489" dur="4.351">the storm of tyranny at the hands of the</text>
  <text start="238.8" dur="3.75">likes of Google and YouTube before we</text>
  <text start="240.84" dur="4.02">begin this conversation about the</text>
  <text start="242.55" dur="5.07">potential for suing Google and YouTube</text>
  <text start="244.86" dur="4.2">for acting illegally in my opinion I</text>
  <text start="247.62" dur="3.57">think what they&amp;#39;re doing is at the very</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="3.69">least tortious interference not to</text>
  <text start="251.19" dur="2.85">mention the fact they&amp;#39;re stomping on all</text>
  <text start="252.75" dur="2.76">of our First Amendment rights do you</text>
  <text start="254.04" dur="3.629">want to give us a brief update on the</text>
  <text start="255.51" dur="4.229">Nixon and lawsuits against boy I think</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="4.711">Nick Sandman and you can correct me here</text>
  <text start="259.739" dur="5.191">how many different outlets outlets are</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="4.46">being sued I think NBC News was named</text>
  <text start="264.93" dur="4.76">CNN if if I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="266.84" dur="4.47">steak in certainly Washington Post yeah</text>
  <text start="269.69" dur="3.87">sure I&amp;#39;d be happy to give you an update</text>
  <text start="271.31" dur="3.889">this is public information and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="273.56" dur="3.96">authorized by the sandmen family to</text>
  <text start="275.199" dur="4.69">speak publicly from time to time about</text>
  <text start="277.52" dur="4.26">the case because we want people to</text>
  <text start="279.889" dur="5.731">understand what&amp;#39;s going on we think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="281.78" dur="5.88">very important for all Americans to have</text>
  <text start="285.62" dur="4.829">greater protection when confronted by</text>
  <text start="287.66" dur="5.64">you know whether it be a mob on social</text>
  <text start="290.449" dur="4.621">media or a mob of a journalist who are</text>
  <text start="293.3" dur="3.72">spreading lies and falsehoods about you</text>
  <text start="295.07" dur="3.99">and so we do feel that this lawsuits</text>
  <text start="297.02" dur="5.73">very important and the current status of</text>
  <text start="299.06" dur="6.18">the lawsuit is that we have filed three</text>
  <text start="302.75" dur="4.95">claims the first one was against the</text>
  <text start="305.24" dur="4.83">Washington Post the second one was</text>
  <text start="307.7" dur="7.2">against CNN and the third one is against</text>
  <text start="310.07" dur="6.81">NBC Universal and including MSNBC so all</text>
  <text start="314.9" dur="4.22">the NBC units are covered by that by</text>
  <text start="316.88" dur="5.46">those three lawsuits we plan to file</text>
  <text start="319.12" dur="7.09">probably ten additional lawsuits against</text>
  <text start="322.34" dur="7.47">other defendants such as HBO and Bill</text>
  <text start="326.21" dur="6.03">Maher other news app outlets newspapers</text>
  <text start="329.81" dur="5.96">across the country that republish these</text>
  <text start="332.24" dur="6.78">defamatory statements about Nick Sandman</text>
  <text start="335.77" dur="5.92">but but right now the main thing is is</text>
  <text start="339.02" dur="5.64">three almost a month ago we had oral</text>
  <text start="341.69" dur="6.24">argument in front of the local federal</text>
  <text start="344.66" dur="5.819">judge who has all these cases and it was</text>
  <text start="347.93" dur="5.13">a pretty interesting spectacle I argued</text>
  <text start="350.479" dur="4.201">the case for Nick salmon and some</text>
  <text start="353.06" dur="4.95">attorneys from the law firm Williams &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="354.68" dur="4.919">Connolly which you know is a pretty</text>
  <text start="358.01" dur="3.42">high-powered law firm out of Washington</text>
  <text start="359.599" dur="3.871">DC came in to represent the Washington</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="4.14">Post we had oral argument that went on</text>
  <text start="363.47" dur="4.02">for probably an hour and 20 minutes and</text>
  <text start="365.57" dur="3.659">the judge said that it would take him</text>
  <text start="367.49" dur="4.5">three to four weeks to get a decision</text>
  <text start="369.229" dur="5.25">out in four weeks is Monday so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="371.99" dur="6.03">kind of anxiously waiting to see what he</text>
  <text start="374.479" dur="6.81">says but you know we we do believe that</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="5.28">we that will prevail in these in this</text>
  <text start="381.289" dur="3.841">situation on the motion to dismiss and</text>
  <text start="383.3" dur="4.38">that Court is most likely to let us</text>
  <text start="385.13" dur="4.349">proceed ahead on the case I think the</text>
  <text start="387.68" dur="4.709">fact that we&amp;#39;re even questioning this</text>
  <text start="389.479" dur="5.761">really tells you how hard it is to win a</text>
  <text start="392.389" dur="5.251">defamation case because you know Nick</text>
  <text start="395.24" dur="4.86">Sandman is a minor private figure who</text>
  <text start="397.64" dur="4.26">did nothing and you know</text>
  <text start="400.1" dur="3.69">was a strong motion to dismiss filed by</text>
  <text start="401.9" dur="3.27">The Washington Post it&amp;#39;s taking the</text>
  <text start="403.79" dur="3.45">court some time to consider so it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="405.17" dur="4.17">complex area of law but we remain very</text>
  <text start="407.24" dur="3.93">hopeful that we&amp;#39;re gonna prevail yeah</text>
  <text start="409.34" dur="4.38">well I remain hopeful too because I</text>
  <text start="411.17" dur="3.87">think this is a very very important case</text>
  <text start="413.72" dur="3.6">because if they can get away with</text>
  <text start="415.04" dur="4.8">defaming slandering and otherwise</text>
  <text start="417.32" dur="4.41">causing damage to a minor a private</text>
  <text start="419.84" dur="3.9">citizen as you noted then they can get</text>
  <text start="421.73" dur="3.75">away with hurting any of us evidently so</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="3.96">this is a very important case because</text>
  <text start="425.48" dur="3.93">Nick was a minor you&amp;#39;re right that is</text>
  <text start="427.7" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s I think they really stepped in it</text>
  <text start="429.41" dur="4.56">with this one I hope the judge agrees I</text>
  <text start="432.17" dur="4.74">will see but yeah we agree with you and</text>
  <text start="433.97" dur="4.68">I think the vast majority of people and</text>
  <text start="436.91" dur="3.3">commentators after all this has happened</text>
  <text start="438.65" dur="2.97">you know on the conservative side and</text>
  <text start="440.21" dur="3.6">our friends and neighbors in this</text>
  <text start="441.62" dur="4.68">community agree with that assessment</text>
  <text start="443.81" dur="5.37">okay well let&amp;#39;s talk about what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="446.3" dur="5.46">going on among the big social media</text>
  <text start="449.18" dur="4.32">giants specifically Google and YouTube</text>
  <text start="451.76" dur="3.18">Dustin maybe you want to comment on this</text>
  <text start="453.5" dur="5.31">now did you contract</text>
  <text start="454.94" dur="5.85">Todd is there a lawsuit already in place</text>
  <text start="458.81" dur="4.23">or happening here or let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="460.79" dur="4.2">what your plans are in do the plans</text>
  <text start="463.04" dur="5.63">include Google and YouTube specifically</text>
  <text start="464.99" dur="6.03">or other entities as well so you know I</text>
  <text start="468.67" dur="3.88">love that question and not being kind of</text>
  <text start="471.02" dur="4.92">an advanced attorney myself i I</text>
  <text start="472.55" dur="5.64">approached Todd from kind of a lay</text>
  <text start="475.94" dur="4.35">perspective I saw him standing up to</text>
  <text start="478.19" dur="3.69">bullies I I actually am kind of in the</text>
  <text start="480.29" dur="5.22">position of having been defamed by the</text>
  <text start="481.88" dur="5.79">entire MSM and he censored by big tag</text>
  <text start="485.51" dur="4.08">because of the book and stuff so you</text>
  <text start="487.67" dur="4.44">know it&amp;#39;s interesting to see him stand</text>
  <text start="489.59" dur="4.95">up for the Covington students and for</text>
  <text start="492.11" dur="4.86">that case with with where he&amp;#39;s at now</text>
  <text start="494.54" dur="4.89">and to see him fight like that it</text>
  <text start="496.97" dur="4.5">inspired me to reach out inspired me to</text>
  <text start="499.43" dur="3.99">say maybe we have a shot you know</text>
  <text start="501.47" dur="3.12">obviously the energy of the crowd is</text>
  <text start="503.42" dur="3.41">with us people have seen it</text>
  <text start="504.59" dur="4.83">anyone who&amp;#39;s online can&amp;#39;t miss the</text>
  <text start="506.83" dur="5.74">blatant bias and double standards and</text>
  <text start="509.42" dur="5.58">censorship a big tax so I asked him look</text>

  <text start="537.26" dur="4.38">by yourself many of us would be happy to</text>
  <text start="539.75" dur="3.84">get behind this and we could start a go</text>
  <text start="541.64" dur="3.96">fund me and we could crowdsource this</text>

  <text start="609.68" dur="7.17">cliff yeah no I what we&amp;#39;re doing for</text>
  <text start="613.52" dur="5.19">Dustin is we are looking at the law as</text>
  <text start="616.85" dur="5.43">he said to try to find a chink in the</text>
  <text start="618.71" dur="5.76">armor to to go in and attack the social</text>
  <text start="622.28" dur="6.21">media companies in a appropriate legal</text>
  <text start="624.47" dur="6.3">manner and as I&amp;#39;ve spoken before on on</text>
  <text start="628.49" dur="3.99">Dustin&amp;#39;s interviews you know they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="630.77" dur="3.54">protected by this Communications Decency</text>
  <text start="632.48" dur="3.3">Act which has proven to be a hard thing</text>
  <text start="634.31" dur="3.08">to get around there&amp;#39;s a number of cases</text>
  <text start="635.78" dur="4.35">out there where people have attempted to</text>
  <text start="637.39" dur="4.96">circumvent that and failed and Dustin</text>
  <text start="640.13" dur="4.47">and I spoke earlier about Laurel Umar&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="642.35" dur="4.8">case and for example you know when you</text>
  <text start="644.6" dur="4.95">look at Laurel Umar&amp;#39;s case she makes a</text>
  <text start="647.15" dur="4.88">compelling case for defamation but the</text>
  <text start="649.55" dur="5.34">Communications Decency Act also protects</text>
  <text start="652.03" dur="5.92">social media outlets like Facebook that</text>
  <text start="654.89" dur="5.28">she is suing from that type of claim so</text>
  <text start="657.95" dur="4.98">she&amp;#39;s got high hurdles to go over but</text>
  <text start="660.17" dur="5.4">there are other potential avenues I</text>
  <text start="662.93" dur="4.51">think the evidence that you mentioned</text>
  <text start="665.57" dur="5.56">where they&amp;#39;re actually sensor</text>
  <text start="667.44" dur="5.43">people and where they are basically</text>
  <text start="671.13" dur="4.89">taking away your First Amendment rights</text>
  <text start="672.87" dur="6.39">to speak in this huge open forum of</text>
  <text start="676.02" dur="6.21">social media we hope to find a way to to</text>
  <text start="679.26" dur="5.4">do that and and what I promised to do</text>
  <text start="682.23" dur="4.86">for Dustin and for his followers is to</text>
  <text start="684.66" dur="4.71">really take a deep dive into the law</text>
  <text start="687.09" dur="3.93">what I had noticed from reading some of</text>
  <text start="689.37" dur="3.63">the other cases that have been filed I</text>
  <text start="691.02" dur="5.58">don&amp;#39;t always think that they had the</text>
  <text start="693" dur="5.31">best approaches to the case so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="696.6" dur="4.68">hoping to find a better approach and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="698.31" dur="4.5">I I have you know some people working on</text>
  <text start="701.28" dur="3.69">this and have been checking in with them</text>
  <text start="702.81" dur="3.42">and I&amp;#39;m working on it too and we do</text>
  <text start="704.97" dur="3">believe that we&amp;#39;re going to have a path</text>
  <text start="706.23" dur="3.48">and I hope that honestly haven&amp;#39;t given</text>
  <text start="707.97" dur="3.72">Dustin a timeline but I hope within the</text>
  <text start="709.71" dur="3.54">next seven to ten days to have the</text>
  <text start="711.69" dur="4.11">completed work product and we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="713.25" dur="4.62">more to talk about then but right now</text>
  <text start="715.8" dur="4.17">the statement is I think that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="717.87" dur="4.92">gonna find some find some viable</text>
  <text start="719.97" dur="3.84">challenges to what&amp;#39;s going on okay I</text>
  <text start="722.79" dur="2.85">want you to break down the</text>
  <text start="723.81" dur="3">communications and decency act for me I</text>
  <text start="725.64" dur="2.64">think when you mention that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="726.81" dur="3.6">probably referring specifically to</text>
  <text start="728.28" dur="3.87">section 230 correct and can you break</text>
  <text start="730.41" dur="3.96">that down for our audience because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="732.15" dur="4.29">my understanding at least as it pertains</text>
  <text start="734.37" dur="3.69">to the people on the left they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="736.44" dur="3.48">mind watching conservatives and</text>
  <text start="738.06" dur="4.2">Christians and libertarians get banned</text>
  <text start="739.92" dur="3.96">or shadow banned or blocked or having</text>
  <text start="742.26" dur="3.66">their YouTube channels terminated</text>
  <text start="743.88" dur="4.68">without cause or warning because they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="745.92" dur="5.01">say these are private companies but</text>
  <text start="748.56" dur="4.56">these public platforms are now so huge</text>
  <text start="750.93" dur="4.98">YouTube is the biggest video sharing</text>
  <text start="753.12" dur="4.62">public platform in the world so it</text>
  <text start="755.91" dur="4.85">really is the town square for free</text>
  <text start="757.74" dur="5.07">speech can they have it both ways I</text>
  <text start="760.76" dur="4.27">don&amp;#39;t deserve to have it both ways</text>
  <text start="762.81" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;re absolutely correct about the</text>
  <text start="765.03" dur="5.13">section of the Communications Decency</text>
  <text start="766.38" dur="5.88">Act that applies and that that section</text>
  <text start="770.16" dur="4.59">provides these enormous protections you</text>
  <text start="772.26" dur="3.87">know the law was passed in the 1990s I</text>
  <text start="774.75" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t think anybody who helped draft</text>
  <text start="776.13" dur="3.93">that law could foresee where we would be</text>
  <text start="778.47" dur="4.05">today and where these social media</text>
  <text start="780.06" dur="6.08">platforms would be the center of public</text>
  <text start="782.52" dur="6">discourse and so I am hopeful that</text>
  <text start="786.14" dur="4.42">through some of the arguments at Dustin</text>
  <text start="788.52" dur="5.4">is helped fund and develop that we will</text>
  <text start="790.56" dur="7.35">be able to to bring that argument in</text>
  <text start="793.92" dur="6.96">particular to a court I think it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="797.91" dur="5.07">compelling to be able to say to</text>
  <text start="800.88" dur="3.9">to a judge and to the public just what</text>
  <text start="802.98" dur="5.67">you said and but put that in a legal</text>
  <text start="804.78" dur="5.7">document that that you know YouTube and</text>
  <text start="808.65" dur="3.81">Facebook and Twitter have to come and</text>
  <text start="810.48" dur="5.76">respond to and where they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="812.46" dur="6.63">win right off the bat from a protection</text>
  <text start="816.24" dur="4.35">provided by the by the CDA so that&amp;#39;s our</text>
  <text start="819.09" dur="3.96">hope that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s our goal one of</text>
  <text start="820.59" dur="4.35">we want to win yeah yeah and Dustin</text>
  <text start="823.05" dur="2.61">again as you and I have talked about via</text>
  <text start="824.94" dur="2.79">email</text>
  <text start="825.66" dur="4.08">you know you&amp;#39;ve taken this on yourself</text>
  <text start="827.73" dur="3.63">so my hats off to you but we don&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="829.74" dur="4.62">thought I just want to be real clear</text>
  <text start="831.36" dur="5.4">here the people on YouTube who care</text>
  <text start="834.36" dur="4.59">about their free speech the people look</text>
  <text start="836.76" dur="4.83">the people who are ideologically opposed</text>
  <text start="838.95" dur="4.5">to the democratic point of view to the</text>
  <text start="841.59" dur="4.05">liberal Marxist point of view we should</text>
  <text start="843.45" dur="5.01">be allowed to have our voices on YouTube</text>
  <text start="845.64" dur="5.22">on Twitter my website should not be</text>
  <text start="848.46" dur="5.4">funneled down Google no longer promotes</text>
  <text start="850.86" dur="4.89">any of my look nothing on my website can</text>
  <text start="853.86" dur="4.47">be found via Google search anymore you</text>
  <text start="855.75" dur="4.26">got to type in Sgt report.com directly</text>
  <text start="858.33" dur="3.57">this is all a result of their algos</text>
  <text start="860.01" dur="3.27">changes so I just want everybody</text>
  <text start="861.9" dur="3.09">listening to know that if you want to</text>
  <text start="863.28" dur="3.57">get behind this lawsuit at the end of</text>
  <text start="864.99" dur="3.9">the interview will ask dust and how to</text>
  <text start="866.85" dur="3.72">do that because Dustin&amp;#39;s the one that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="868.89" dur="3.48">taking this on but we all want to get</text>
  <text start="870.57" dur="5.1">behind it so let me ask you this time</text>
  <text start="872.37" dur="5.4">what type of lawsuit is this the stand</text>
  <text start="875.67" dur="3.51">working directly with you and what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="877.77" dur="3.45">difference between this type of lawsuit</text>
  <text start="879.18" dur="3.15">and maybe a class action because I&amp;#39;m all</text>
  <text start="881.22" dur="3.06">about getting on board with a</text>
  <text start="882.33" dur="4.29">class-action lawsuit does that give us</text>
  <text start="884.28" dur="6.15">any more power just explain the nuances</text>
  <text start="886.62" dur="5.94">of this particular lawsuit okay well at</text>
  <text start="890.43" dur="4.05">this juncture we haven&amp;#39;t drafted the</text>
  <text start="892.56" dur="4.17">lawsuit what we&amp;#39;re gonna do is work with</text>
  <text start="894.48" dur="4.35">Dustin to identify the best vehicle</text>
  <text start="896.73" dur="3.69">including the possibility of a class</text>
  <text start="898.83" dur="5.1">action so when you talk about a class</text>
  <text start="900.42" dur="6.69">action if you mentioned the the</text>
  <text start="903.93" dur="4.83">algorithms have been modified and you</text>
  <text start="907.11" dur="4.14">and a lot of people you and I and others</text>
  <text start="908.76" dur="5.4">believe that the algorithms are biased</text>
  <text start="911.25" dur="5.1">against conservative voices you know</text>
  <text start="914.16" dur="4.74">getting a group of conservatives to</text>
  <text start="916.35" dur="4.47">serve as plaintiffs and to allege a</text>
  <text start="918.9" dur="6.18">class action of those injured by the</text>
  <text start="920.82" dur="6.87">algorithms is a possibility but you know</text>
  <text start="925.08" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re waiting for the final statement of</text>
  <text start="927.69" dur="4.56">law to know what&amp;#39;s the right legal</text>
  <text start="929.49" dur="5.22">pathway to do that now it could also be</text>
  <text start="932.25" dur="5.04">that a single a single</text>
  <text start="934.71" dur="4.05">person could bring the claim and it</text>
  <text start="937.29" dur="4.94">really depends upon the potential</text>
  <text start="938.76" dur="5.88">damages I explained this to Dustin and</text>
  <text start="942.23" dur="4.45">you know the idea is in a class action</text>
  <text start="944.64" dur="4.56">everybody has to have the same harm and</text>
  <text start="946.68" dur="5.64">then you then you judge the damages by</text>
  <text start="949.2" dur="5.46">all of the many potential members of the</text>
  <text start="952.32" dur="4.83">class so you and Dustin might suffer the</text>
  <text start="954.66" dur="3.99">effects of the same algorithm and your</text>
  <text start="957.15" dur="2.73">damages would be a little bit different</text>
  <text start="958.65" dur="2.4">than Dustin&amp;#39;s but you would both be</text>
  <text start="959.88" dur="3.57">appropriate plaintiffs for a</text>
  <text start="961.05" dur="3.54">class-action lawsuit but those are some</text>
  <text start="963.45" dur="4.11">of the things that we&amp;#39;re working through</text>
  <text start="964.59" dur="5.58">we don&amp;#39;t have the exact legal vehicle in</text>
  <text start="967.56" dur="4.68">place yet we&amp;#39;re working to identify it</text>
  <text start="970.17" dur="4.5">so we&amp;#39;re still getting there it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="972.24" dur="4.35">a scalpel precision kind of move and we</text>
  <text start="974.67" dur="3.99">have talked even about offering to</text>
  <text start="976.59" dur="4.5">represent someone else&amp;#39;s case like not a</text>
  <text start="978.66" dur="4.44">my case or even a class action</text>
  <text start="981.09" dur="5.25">necessarily but possibly even just a</text>
  <text start="983.1" dur="4.71">like a mini AOC or or a Candice Owens or</text>
  <text start="986.34" dur="3.3">someone who ordered like Candice has</text>
  <text start="987.81" dur="4.11">direct whistleblowers from Facebook</text>
  <text start="989.64" dur="3.93">dumping information to her about how</text>
  <text start="991.92" dur="3.45">she&amp;#39;s being segregated intentionally</text>
  <text start="993.57" dur="3.39">like that&amp;#39;s a winner I think I mean</text>
  <text start="995.37" dur="4.2">those kind of cases are stronger than</text>
  <text start="996.96" dur="3.78">any case I could bring but I just want</text>
  <text start="999.57" dur="4.23">to win you know I just want to stop them</text>
  <text start="1000.74" dur="4.59">break censorship yeah Todd all we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1003.8" dur="3.6">asking for is a level playing field</text>
  <text start="1005.33" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re not asking for special treatment</text>
  <text start="1007.4" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;re just asking for the level playing</text>
  <text start="1009.38" dur="4.65">field because when there was a level</text>
  <text start="1010.88" dur="4.98">playing field which has slowly changed</text>
  <text start="1014.03" dur="4.11">over time and then it got really bad on</text>
  <text start="1015.86" dur="4.38">or around January 22nd of this year on</text>
  <text start="1018.14" dur="4.02">YouTube specifically but when there was</text>
  <text start="1020.24" dur="4.23">more of a level playing field we were</text>
  <text start="1022.16" dur="3.99">doing very well in the public square and</text>
  <text start="1024.47" dur="3.48">I think that&amp;#39;s why they changed their</text>
  <text start="1026.15" dur="3.689">algorithms and now they&amp;#39;re promoting</text>
  <text start="1027.95" dur="4.17">what they call more authoritative news</text>
  <text start="1029.839" dur="5.041">sources all of which are mainstream</text>
  <text start="1032.12" dur="4.74">media sources so no longer do you see</text>
  <text start="1034.88" dur="3.84">any of my videos in the recommended</text>
  <text start="1036.86" dur="4.17">column and whereas last year I was</text>
  <text start="1038.72" dur="4.53">adding between 30 and 35,000 new</text>
  <text start="1041.03" dur="4.05">subscribers each month because my videos</text>
  <text start="1043.25" dur="3.8">were being recommended now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1045.08" dur="5.04">not that number has fallen to around</text>
  <text start="1047.05" dur="5.86">2,500 new subscribers a month so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1050.12" dur="4.83">really taking onerous action against so</text>
  <text start="1052.91" dur="4.2">many of us to silence us and the other</text>
  <text start="1054.95" dur="6">question I wanted to ask you is in their</text>
  <text start="1057.11" dur="5.97">basket of tools to hurt us and hurt</text>
  <text start="1060.95" dur="4.53">people whose political speech they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1063.08" dur="3.83">agree with they have the monetization</text>
  <text start="1065.48" dur="3.86">tool and</text>
  <text start="1066.91" dur="4.74">to ask your opinion on that now given</text>
  <text start="1069.34" dur="5.22">that there private companies can they</text>
  <text start="1071.65" dur="5.28">pick and choose to the degree that they</text>
  <text start="1074.56" dur="3.87">have been who gets monetization and who</text>
  <text start="1076.93" dur="3.78">doesn&amp;#39;t because 80 to 90 percent</text>
  <text start="1078.43" dur="4.41">actually just about all my videos that I</text>
  <text start="1080.71" dur="3.93">put up lately are immediately labeled</text>
  <text start="1082.84" dur="5.07">not suitable for most advertisers</text>
  <text start="1084.64" dur="5.22">despite the fact that I have 98 to 99</text>
  <text start="1087.91" dur="4.14">percent likes on my video so my audience</text>
  <text start="1089.86" dur="4.23">my information very much resonates with</text>
  <text start="1092.05" dur="5.25">these are people who shop they need</text>
  <text start="1094.09" dur="5.34">products they go to Target so absolutely</text>
  <text start="1097.3" dur="4.35">my audience is suitable for advertisers</text>
  <text start="1099.43" dur="4.26">just not in YouTube&amp;#39;s view so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1101.65" dur="5.67">question number one can they use the</text>
  <text start="1103.69" dur="5.88">monetization tool legally as a penalty</text>
  <text start="1107.32" dur="4.74">to hurt us and number two I want to cite</text>
  <text start="1109.57" dur="4.91">this example I think the channel is just</text>
  <text start="1112.06" dur="5.13">informed talk he just had his entire</text>
  <text start="1114.48" dur="5.08">channel D monetized overnight while he</text>
  <text start="1117.19" dur="4.11">slept now this is despite the fact that</text>
  <text start="1119.56" dur="2.94">he like me would have eighty to ninety</text>
  <text start="1121.3" dur="3.3">percent of his videos immediately</text>
  <text start="1122.5" dur="5.13">demonetized but then you can ask for a</text>
  <text start="1124.6" dur="4.98">manual review and in rare cases they</text>
  <text start="1127.63" dur="4.02">would say upon further review we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1129.58" dur="3.78">deemed that your video is suitable for</text>
  <text start="1131.65" dur="4.08">most advertisers so they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="1133.36" dur="3.84">reviewed them in his case and said yep</text>
  <text start="1135.73" dur="3.3">these twenty percent are good for</text>
  <text start="1137.2" dur="3.12">advertising but then they went in</text>
  <text start="1139.03" dur="2.13">overnight the other night and they</text>
  <text start="1140.32" dur="3.69">demonetised</text>
  <text start="1141.16" dur="6">all of them to which I asked Susan</text>
  <text start="1144.01" dur="5.37">Wojcicki the CEO of YouTube and at Team</text>
  <text start="1147.16" dur="3.84">YouTube via Twitter how is this not</text>
  <text start="1149.38" dur="4.26">blatant political bias</text>
  <text start="1151" dur="5.19">please share your concise reasons for</text>
  <text start="1153.64" dur="4.35">having done this to just inform talk so</text>
  <text start="1156.19" dur="5.78">I know I&amp;#39;m babbling here but is this</text>
  <text start="1157.99" dur="6.48">legal the D monetization i I think that</text>
  <text start="1161.97" dur="5.14">YouTube would say it&amp;#39;s legal and that</text>
  <text start="1164.47" dur="4.5">would be their opinion based upon what</text>
  <text start="1167.11" dur="3.93">they perceive or what they what their</text>
  <text start="1168.97" dur="4.44">current legal relationship is with you</text>
  <text start="1171.04" dur="4.68">and with others you know I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="1173.41" dur="5.22">different explanations as to why a lot</text>
  <text start="1175.72" dur="4.38">of channels are being D monetized you</text>
  <text start="1178.63" dur="3.03">know and that they want to get to fewer</text>
  <text start="1180.1" dur="3.36">and larger channels and that that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1181.66" dur="3.78">business model decision that&amp;#39;s I think</text>
  <text start="1183.46" dur="4.41">what they would say but I think that the</text>
  <text start="1185.44" dur="5.61">truth is that that they&amp;#39;d like to have</text>
  <text start="1187.87" dur="6.12">control of Communications and they want</text>
  <text start="1191.05" dur="5.07">to limit expression from you know people</text>
  <text start="1193.99" dur="5.04">with whom they do not agree I would</text>
  <text start="1196.12" dur="4.49">think I believe that the monetization or</text>
  <text start="1199.03" dur="3.74">D monetization issue</text>
  <text start="1200.61" dur="4.199">to go and in hand with what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1202.77" dur="4.86">talking about so in other words it would</text>
  <text start="1204.809" dur="5.071">be unfair to pick your favorite speaker</text>
  <text start="1207.63" dur="5.4">in the town square but keep in mind that</text>
  <text start="1209.88" dur="4.65">an advertiser may just say I only you</text>
  <text start="1213.03" dur="3.57">know AT&amp;amp;T which i think is the most</text>
  <text start="1214.53" dur="5.67">disgusting liberal corporation in the</text>
  <text start="1216.6" dur="6.15">entire world they would be able to say</text>
  <text start="1220.2" dur="4.56">well we don&amp;#39;t want to advertise with sgt</text>
  <text start="1222.75" dur="5.49">or with dustin Nima&amp;#39;s we only want to</text>
  <text start="1224.76" dur="6.03">advertise with you know MSNBC or</text>
  <text start="1228.24" dur="5.28">whatever so you have that issue as well</text>
  <text start="1230.79" dur="4.98">that the advertisers have a saying and</text>
  <text start="1233.52" dur="3.6">where they want their money to go but at</text>
  <text start="1235.77" dur="3.45">the same time picking and choosing I</text>
  <text start="1237.12" dur="3.96">think is really problematic but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1239.22" dur="4.26">have a clear answer because we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1241.08" dur="3.39">dug into that issue this D please as we</text>
  <text start="1243.48" dur="4.53">need to at this point</text>
  <text start="1244.47" dur="5.16">sure rolling yeah it just considerate I</text>
  <text start="1248.01" dur="3.48">want you to think about that because you</text>
  <text start="1249.63" dur="5.07">know from the conservative perspective</text>
  <text start="1251.49" dur="5.91">there are many specific advertisers that</text>
  <text start="1254.7" dur="4.469">would want to advertise with channels</text>
  <text start="1257.4" dur="3.54">like mine because they want access to my</text>
  <text start="1259.169" dur="3.451">informed intelligent Christian</text>
  <text start="1260.94" dur="3.18">conservative audience so you can think</text>
  <text start="1262.62" dur="3.39">of what advertisers are those may be</text>
  <text start="1264.12" dur="4.47">they may not be McDonald&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="1266.01" dur="4.71">but there are specific advertisers right</text>
  <text start="1268.59" dur="3.51">maybe it&amp;#39;s Ruby all right maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1270.72" dur="2.9">Smith &amp;amp; Wesson I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1272.1" dur="4.02">saying but there are specific</text>
  <text start="1273.62" dur="4.15">advertisers out there that would very</text>
  <text start="1276.12" dur="3.179">much want access to my audience and</text>
  <text start="1277.77" dur="3.81">Dustin&amp;#39;s okay let me ask you this then</text>
  <text start="1279.299" dur="4.681">oh well before I forget tortious</text>
  <text start="1281.58" dur="3.479">interference so I have when I got a</text>
  <text start="1283.98" dur="3.54">hundred thousand YouTube subscribers</text>
  <text start="1285.059" dur="3.511">they gave me a direct contact at YouTube</text>
  <text start="1287.52" dur="3.149">her name is Hadassah</text>
  <text start="1288.57" dur="4.859">she&amp;#39;s been fantastic over the years very</text>
  <text start="1290.669" dur="4.411">supportive until this year now she</text>
  <text start="1293.429" dur="3.721">doesn&amp;#39;t return my emails</text>
  <text start="1295.08" dur="4.469">they say she went on leave and I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1297.15" dur="4.64">talk to anybody but after the YouTube ad</text>
  <text start="1299.549" dur="4.171">pocalypse a year and a half ago or so</text>
  <text start="1301.79" dur="4">that&amp;#39;s when nobody was getting</text>
  <text start="1303.72" dur="3.57">advertising because all the advertisers</text>
  <text start="1305.79" dur="3.48">were rebelling against YouTube because</text>
  <text start="1307.29" dur="4.129">they wanted this type of censorship to</text>
  <text start="1309.27" dur="3.72">be carried out now it has been but</text>
  <text start="1311.419" dur="4.721">tortious interference</text>
  <text start="1312.99" dur="4.5">hadass told me specifically after the ad</text>
  <text start="1316.14" dur="3.36">pocalypse she said what we&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="1317.49" dur="4.08">our YouTube partners to do is don&amp;#39;t rely</text>
  <text start="1319.5" dur="4.71">on us for advertising go build your own</text>
  <text start="1321.57" dur="5.31">third-party relationships and use your</text>
  <text start="1324.21" dur="4.56">channels reach in power to advertise for</text>
  <text start="1326.88" dur="3.9">those personal relationships that you</text>
  <text start="1328.77" dur="3.93">set up I did that so now I have</text>
  <text start="1330.78" dur="3.42">advertisers that want to reach my</text>
  <text start="1332.7" dur="3.87">audience in place but be</text>
  <text start="1334.2" dur="4.2">YouTube is throttling down my channel</text>
  <text start="1336.57" dur="3.63">because their shadow banning they&amp;#39;re no</text>
  <text start="1338.4" dur="3.69">longer recommending my content I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1340.2" dur="4.01">getting any new subscribers to me that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1342.09" dur="5.46">tortious interference it&amp;#39;s a third party</text>
  <text start="1344.21" dur="4.57">interfering with me and my audience I</text>
  <text start="1347.55" dur="2.97">think that&amp;#39;s illegal</text>
  <text start="1348.78" dur="3.75">so that might be a leg you guys could</text>
  <text start="1350.52" dur="4.05">explore as well yeah tortious</text>
  <text start="1352.53" dur="4.41">interference is a great claim if you</text>
  <text start="1354.57" dur="3.69">have a contract with somebody so for</text>
  <text start="1356.94" dur="3.99">example you have a contract with an</text>
  <text start="1358.26" dur="4.05">advertiser and you say I&amp;#39;ve got this</text>
  <text start="1360.93" dur="5.19">channel and we have this this</text>
  <text start="1362.31" dur="6.9">information and then YouTube then goes</text>
  <text start="1366.12" dur="4.65">in and suppresses your channel because</text>
  <text start="1369.21" dur="4.29">they don&amp;#39;t like what you&amp;#39;re saying yes</text>
  <text start="1370.77" dur="4.59">then I think that that would give rise</text>
  <text start="1373.5" dur="3.48">to a tortious interference claim and</text>
  <text start="1375.36" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;ve you know that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a creative</text>
  <text start="1376.98" dur="5.07">idea and I think those are things that</text>
  <text start="1379.74" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re all looking at good well I&amp;#39;m so</text>
  <text start="1382.05" dur="3.9">glad you&amp;#39;re on board here and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1384.03" dur="3.69">gonna give Dustin a chance to tell us</text>
  <text start="1385.95" dur="3.9">how to support this thing but I think</text>
  <text start="1387.72" dur="4.83">the final question I have and maybe</text>
  <text start="1389.85" dur="4.71">Dustin has some that I miss done is I</text>
  <text start="1392.55" dur="4.44">want to ask you about election</text>
  <text start="1394.56" dur="4.83">interference I think what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1396.99" dur="5.31">here and I think we all know it is that</text>
  <text start="1399.39" dur="5.49">Google and they&amp;#39;ve said it they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1402.3" dur="4.53">have a plan in place in 2016 they never</text>
  <text start="1404.88" dur="4.2">thought she&amp;#39;d lose they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="1406.83" dur="4.74">same thing to happen in 2020 so those of</text>
  <text start="1409.08" dur="5.31">us who are out on YouTube and have reach</text>
  <text start="1411.57" dur="4.92">and our analysts of political</text>
  <text start="1414.39" dur="3.81">information many of us are Journal I</text>
  <text start="1416.49" dur="4.41">have a degree in journalism from the</text>
  <text start="1418.2" dur="5.22">University of Wisconsin so many of us</text>
  <text start="1420.9" dur="2.85">citizen journalists are telling the</text>
  <text start="1423.42" dur="2.85">truth</text>
  <text start="1423.75" dur="5.52">as we see it about the political sphere</text>
  <text start="1426.27" dur="5.22">about the talking points coming from the</text>
  <text start="1429.27" dur="5.13">leftists the Democrats so many of whom</text>
  <text start="1431.49" dur="5.7">now are Marxists their ideology does not</text>
  <text start="1434.4" dur="4.71">resonate with most Americans many people</text>
  <text start="1437.19" dur="4.2">in the Democratic Party are walking away</text>
  <text start="1439.11" dur="4.98">in droves because they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="1441.39" dur="4.59">considered Marxists they&amp;#39;re not Marxists</text>
  <text start="1444.09" dur="4.29">and the Democratic Party has betrayed</text>
  <text start="1445.98" dur="5.79">them as we tell that story moving into</text>
  <text start="1448.38" dur="5.19">2020 YouTube wants us silenced Google</text>
  <text start="1451.77" dur="3.39">wants us silenced they&amp;#39;ve said it</text>
  <text start="1453.57" dur="3.21">themselves so as we continue to hear</text>
  <text start="1455.16" dur="3.87">about Russia gate in the Russians</text>
  <text start="1456.78" dur="3.54">meddling in the election I could play a</text>
  <text start="1459.03" dur="3.39">sound clip for you right here from</text>
  <text start="1460.32" dur="4.62">sundar pichai the CEO of Google saying</text>
  <text start="1462.42" dur="4.58">in a congressional hearing that the</text>
  <text start="1464.94" dur="3.13">Russian interference in the election was</text>
  <text start="1467" dur="2.54">4040</text>
  <text start="1468.07" dur="3.84">five hundred dollars in advertising I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1469.54" dur="6.57">not making that up there were two main</text>
  <text start="1471.91" dur="6.39">ad accounts linked to Russia which which</text>
  <text start="1476.11" dur="3.57">you know advertised on Google for about</text>
  <text start="1478.3" dur="2.22">forty seven hundred dollars in</text>
  <text start="1479.68" dur="3.24">advertising</text>
  <text start="1480.52" dur="4.47">we also found other limited total of</text>
  <text start="1482.92" dur="5.07">forty seven hundred dollars that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="1484.99" dur="4.71">so when we talk about interference in</text>
  <text start="1487.99" dur="3.57">the elections I think the real</text>
  <text start="1489.7" dur="3.38">interference is coming from Google and</text>
  <text start="1491.56" dur="3.66">YouTube that wants to shut up</text>
  <text start="1493.08" dur="5.11">conservatives in libertarians speech</text>
  <text start="1495.22" dur="5.46">prior to that election absolutely I I</text>
  <text start="1498.19" dur="5.22">agree with you hundred percent I clearly</text>
  <text start="1500.68" dur="5.55">the the whole Russian effort on on</text>
  <text start="1503.41" dur="4.38">Facebook and social medias amounted to</text>
  <text start="1506.23" dur="4.08">nothing I mean he was outspent by</text>
  <text start="1507.79" dur="4.38">President Trump or that all that effort</text>
  <text start="1510.31" dur="3.87">was you know minuscule by comparison to</text>
  <text start="1512.17" dur="4.56">what the candidates actually spent on</text>
  <text start="1514.18" dur="4.98">that so I share your concern that</text>
  <text start="1516.73" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s gonna be a real effort to us to</text>
  <text start="1519.16" dur="4.14">suppress your voice and others with the</text>
  <text start="1521.68" dur="4.11">idea being that the electorate will be</text>
  <text start="1523.3" dur="5.34">less enthusiastic or less informed I</text>
  <text start="1525.79" dur="6.27">think it was you probably all saw the</text>
  <text start="1528.64" dur="6.03">testimony from Senator Cruz&amp;#39;s hearing in</text>
  <text start="1532.06" dur="4.74">the Senate where that fellow the expert</text>
  <text start="1534.67" dur="6.15">witness presenting to the Senate there</text>
  <text start="1536.8" dur="6.12">said that YouTube was able to like I</text>
  <text start="1540.82" dur="4.65">think it was suppress or increase the</text>
  <text start="1542.92" dur="4.86">vote for Hillary by you know nearly</text>
  <text start="1545.47" dur="4.41">three to ten million dollars or three to</text>
  <text start="1547.78" dur="4.23">eleven million votes so you know it is a</text>
  <text start="1549.88" dur="4.32">very serious issue and I agree with you</text>
  <text start="1552.01" dur="3.81">all right Todd is there anything that</text>
  <text start="1554.2" dur="3.15">you think I missed is there a question</text>
  <text start="1555.82" dur="3.78">that I should have asked if you were</text>
  <text start="1557.35" dur="3.78">sitting in my seat here because I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1559.6" dur="3.06">so glad you&amp;#39;re on board here your</text>
  <text start="1561.13" dur="2.88">pedigree here with Nick salmon and the</text>
  <text start="1562.66" dur="2.88">Covington kids to me I know you&amp;#39;ve taken</text>
  <text start="1564.01" dur="3.18">a lot of heat for that but my hats off</text>
  <text start="1565.54" dur="3.63">to you for stepping into the ring and</text>
  <text start="1567.19" dur="3.57">standing up for those of us who are</text>
  <text start="1569.17" dur="3.24">being trampled on especially in the case</text>
  <text start="1570.76" dur="3.09">of that minor Nick&amp;#39;s salmon so any</text>
  <text start="1572.41" dur="4.05">questions you think I should have asked</text>
  <text start="1573.85" dur="5.13">anything I missed here no I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1576.46" dur="4.17">you and I and and Dustin are and pretty</text>
  <text start="1578.98" dur="3.99">much agreement as to what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="1580.63" dur="6.15">why it&amp;#39;s happening and and I think we</text>
  <text start="1582.97" dur="7.26">just need to find a way to fight back my</text>
  <text start="1586.78" dur="5.79">main concern is as the censorship and</text>
  <text start="1590.23" dur="3.87">suppression picks up what that means for</text>
  <text start="1592.57" dur="4.08">our next election and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1594.1" dur="4.11">important that we return Donald Trump is</text>
  <text start="1596.65" dur="4">president because he&amp;#39;s done such a great</text>
  <text start="1598.21" dur="3.79">job so far and</text>
  <text start="1600.65" dur="3.24">I just hope that we&amp;#39;re successful we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1612.47" dur="4.08">talked about so many times none of us in</text>
  <text start="1614.69" dur="3.51">the conservative libertarian alternative</text>
  <text start="1616.55" dur="4.02">truth media are looking for one leader</text>
  <text start="1618.2" dur="4.05">so I made that real clear to you early</text>
  <text start="1620.57" dur="3.3">on but my hats off to you because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1622.25" dur="3.96">the one who set this up you got the ball</text>

  <text start="1626.21" dur="5.52">now because of you so how can we help</text>
  <text start="1629.21" dur="4.59">support your efforts and I guess maybe</text>
  <text start="1631.73" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;ll learn more after we learn what</text>
  <text start="1633.8" dur="2.7">kind of lawsuit you guys are gonna put</text>
  <text start="1635.24" dur="2.7">together what the particulars are and</text>
  <text start="1636.5" dur="4.53">then maybe we crowd fund it at that</text>
  <text start="1637.94" dur="5.22">point what are you thinking so I I kind</text>
  <text start="1641.03" dur="3.99">of came at this from sort of a sneak up</text>
  <text start="1643.16" dur="4.38">on him strategy and a little bit of art</text>
  <text start="1645.02" dur="4.59">of war makes 10 and I also thought about</text>
  <text start="1647.54" dur="3.63">incentives and I wanted to build a</text>
  <text start="1649.61" dur="4.05">movement that&amp;#39;s where the stop bit</text>
  <text start="1651.17" dur="4.74">burning concept came from like digital</text>
  <text start="1653.66" dur="2.97">book burning obviously which is what</text>
  <text start="1655.91" dur="2.94">we&amp;#39;re facing here</text>
  <text start="1656.63" dur="3.42">so I created stop by burning calm for</text>
  <text start="1658.85" dur="4.35">updates you can see kind of the</text>
  <text start="1660.05" dur="4.92">interviews and stuff but for funding at</text>
  <text start="1663.2" dur="3.78">first I live into doing a non-profit you</text>
  <text start="1664.97" dur="5.19">can&amp;#39;t do that in this sort of sense to</text>
  <text start="1666.98" dur="5.61">do a lawsuit secondly I considered</text>
  <text start="1670.16" dur="4.47">crowdfunding it and stuff but you know I</text>
  <text start="1672.59" dur="4.89">wanted to get the ball rolling at least</text>
  <text start="1674.63" dur="4.98">and I don&amp;#39;t see this as an eel eating it</text>
  <text start="1677.48" dur="3.38">situation I see stop it burning is sort</text>
  <text start="1679.61" dur="4.35">of a where we go one will you all</text>
  <text start="1680.86" dur="4.84">lawsuit movement initiative and I want</text>
  <text start="1683.96" dur="3.69">that to be a roundtable and I want that</text>
  <text start="1685.7" dur="3.84">roundtable to basically just be free</text>
  <text start="1687.65" dur="3.6">speech you know it&amp;#39;s the one thing I</text>
  <text start="1689.54" dur="3.81">think that everyone should be able to</text>
  <text start="1691.25" dur="4.38">agree on and I think we can all come</text>
  <text start="1693.35" dur="5.07">together as influencers and and at least</text>
  <text start="1695.63" dur="5.58">discuss strategies and ways to fight</text>
  <text start="1698.42" dur="5.1">back you know around that roundtable you</text>
  <text start="1701.21" dur="3.99">know as as peers and equals it&amp;#39;s not I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1703.52" dur="3.72">not trying to lead anybody I&amp;#39;ve got too</text>
  <text start="1705.2" dur="4.38">much going on anyway but do you have</text>
  <text start="1707.24" dur="6">some ideas obviously about you know how</text>
  <text start="1709.58" dur="5.64">to win and and maybe fund it we could do</text>
  <text start="1713.24" dur="5.16">donations and stuff I&amp;#39;m going to do kind</text>
  <text start="1715.22" dur="6.06">of an official white hat to sell just to</text>
  <text start="1718.4" dur="5.13">raise funds and stuff but really the the</text>
  <text start="1721.28" dur="4.56">best idea I&amp;#39;ve come up with so far is as</text>
  <text start="1723.53" dur="4.02">you were saying start other businesses</text>
  <text start="1725.84" dur="3.75">or or partner with other businesses out</text>
  <text start="1727.55" dur="6.09">there outside of a you know kind of big</text>
  <text start="1729.59" dur="5.23">tax and big tech and big ms/ms control</text>
  <text start="1733.64" dur="2.62">space</text>
  <text start="1734.82" dur="3.66">you know I&amp;#39;ve created a few of those</text>
  <text start="1736.26" dur="4.56">small businesses now as well and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1738.48" dur="4.74">partnering with others that are Patriot</text>
  <text start="1740.82" dur="4.62">owned and one of those is white hat</text>
  <text start="1743.22" dur="3.99">Wireless which is coming on board a new</text>
  <text start="1745.44" dur="5.01">corporation that just sells the home</text>
  <text start="1747.21" dur="5.13">service but it&amp;#39;s something where almost</text>
  <text start="1750.45" dur="3.57">everyone in both of our audiences by</text>
  <text start="1752.34" dur="3.9">cell phone service that&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="1754.02" dur="4.65">that might be a recurring revenue source</text>
  <text start="1756.24" dur="4.71">for both of us and more than enough to</text>
  <text start="1758.67" dur="3.81">fund the lawsuit I hope that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="1760.95" dur="3.24">that would be beneficial to all the</text>
  <text start="1762.48" dur="5.55">truth media and and something like that</text>
  <text start="1764.19" dur="5.4">so ideas you know music well in you and</text>
  <text start="1768.03" dur="3.54">I have talked about this too and I just</text>
  <text start="1769.59" dur="4.11">want to be real clear because people are</text>
  <text start="1771.57" dur="4.349">very sensitive about this in the truth</text>
  <text start="1773.7" dur="3.719">space we don&amp;#39;t need one leader so we</text>
  <text start="1775.919" dur="2.821">don&amp;#39;t need you to be the leader Dustin</text>
  <text start="1777.419" dur="3.061">but you got the ball rolling here and we</text>
  <text start="1778.74" dur="3.33">want to support you and I think the best</text>
  <text start="1780.48" dur="3.87">way to do this from my perspective would</text>
  <text start="1782.07" dur="4.14">be to decentralize it with some sort of</text>
  <text start="1784.35" dur="5.22">crowdfunding to help pay Todd and his</text>
  <text start="1786.21" dur="4.92">team and to decentralize it in terms of</text>
  <text start="1789.57" dur="3.63">maybe a class-action lawsuit but I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1791.13" dur="5.64">leave that to you to to decide as as</text>
  <text start="1793.2" dur="5.219">this thing marches down the field and I</text>
  <text start="1796.77" dur="3.57">just pray that we can bring Google and</text>
  <text start="1798.419" dur="3.63">YouTube specifically to heal because</text>
  <text start="1800.34" dur="3.51">they have so much power in its power</text>
  <text start="1802.049" dur="3.691">they&amp;#39;re abusing it and the people on the</text>
  <text start="1803.85" dur="4.23">Left support the that abuse of power</text>
  <text start="1805.74" dur="4.23">wholeheartedly we saw examples of that</text>
  <text start="1808.08" dur="5.37">when Alex Jones was deep platformed</text>
  <text start="1809.97" dur="5.76">pretty much complicit all social media</text>
  <text start="1813.45" dur="5.25">Giants acting within 24 hours to deep</text>
  <text start="1815.73" dur="5.069">platform and dehumanize that guy and all</text>
  <text start="1818.7" dur="4.05">the people on CNN the pundits cheered it</text>
  <text start="1820.799" dur="4.26">they were thrilled to see it happen and</text>
  <text start="1822.75" dur="3.84">they don&amp;#39;t stand for free speech they</text>
  <text start="1825.059" dur="3.451">don&amp;#39;t stand for the First Amendment so</text>
  <text start="1826.59" dur="3.03">I&amp;#39;m glad that we&amp;#39;re all doing that and</text>
  <text start="1828.51" dur="2.22">Todd thank you what for what you&amp;#39;re</text>
