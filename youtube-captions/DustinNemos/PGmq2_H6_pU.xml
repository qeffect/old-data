  <text start="75.979" dur="5.82">Isis Congress has even been briefed on</text>
  <text start="78.34" dur="4.72">the facts that linked this to Isis but</text>
  <text start="81.799" dur="3.901">they still haven&amp;#39;t really come out and</text>
  <text start="83.06" dur="4.979">done much about it so hopefully we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="85.7" dur="4.769">see justice somewhere in the pipeline</text>
  <text start="88.039" dur="5">even though that crooked Sheriff is</text>

  <text start="105.38" dur="5.04">out the other people&amp;#39;s names anyway it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="107.749" dur="7.021">it&amp;#39;s ridiculous but moving on to the</text>
  <text start="110.42" dur="6.36">politics and deep State so I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="114.77" dur="4.08">include this is kind of a crypto and</text>
  <text start="116.78" dur="6.659">economics thing but it&amp;#39;s more than</text>
  <text start="118.85" dur="6.359">relevant to what&amp;#39;s going on in the</text>
  <text start="123.439" dur="3.36">political situation okay there&amp;#39;s a trade</text>
  <text start="125.209" dur="4.351">war it&amp;#39;s all it&amp;#39;s all together that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.799" dur="4.501">why I sometimes say to fully understand</text>
  <text start="129.56" dur="4.11">what&amp;#39;s going on in the world you really</text>
  <text start="131.3" dur="4.92">have to come at this thing from a</text>
  <text start="133.67" dur="5.039">variety of different topics and learn</text>
  <text start="136.22" dur="3.83">the basics about each topic because each</text>
  <text start="138.709" dur="4.051">one kind of</text>
  <text start="140.05" dur="5.7">expansion my dog Johnny kind of expands</text>
  <text start="142.76" dur="5.31">your own perspective it&amp;#39;s sort of like a</text>
  <text start="145.75" dur="4.6">gym or a diamond or something it&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="148.07" dur="4.47">dozens of little surfaces and you have</text>
  <text start="150.35" dur="4.26">to be able to to use each one to get a</text>
  <text start="152.54" dur="6.15">full picture of the inside that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="154.61" dur="5.91">of what&amp;#39;s going on here so Russia is</text>
  <text start="158.69" dur="3.06">going to use crypto I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="160.52" dur="3.45">actually going to make their own which</text>
  <text start="161.75" dur="3.84">has been talked about before but it</text>
  <text start="163.97" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re at least going to end up using</text>
  <text start="165.59" dur="5.84">crypto in some way to get around the US</text>
  <text start="167.78" dur="6.75">sanctions on Iran okay so this is a</text>
  <text start="171.43" dur="4.63">major step forward for kryptos</text>
  <text start="174.53" dur="4.13">governments are actually going to begin</text>
  <text start="176.06" dur="5.1">using it to compete against each other</text>
  <text start="178.66" dur="3.85">rather than what they&amp;#39;re doing now you</text>
  <text start="181.16" dur="2.67">know that&amp;#39;s more free market rather than</text>
  <text start="182.51" dur="2.94">what they&amp;#39;re doing now which is teaming</text>
  <text start="183.83" dur="4.59">up to compete against their peoples</text>
  <text start="185.45" dur="6.27">which is more of a Keynesian central</text>
  <text start="188.42" dur="5.4">bank and government control fiat</text>
  <text start="191.72" dur="4.8">currency style which is very crooked</text>
  <text start="193.82" dur="5.97">very manipulative and hard for people to</text>
  <text start="196.52" dur="4.74">understand if they don&amp;#39;t actually pay</text>
  <text start="199.79" dur="3.75">attention to economics or learn about</text>
  <text start="201.26" dur="7.2">things like inflation or history or or</text>
  <text start="203.54" dur="8.22">the banksters and Broward County</text>
  <text start="208.46" dur="6.57">sheriff&amp;#39;s son kind of back to these</text>
  <text start="211.76" dur="7.23">crooked sheriffs topic was actually in</text>
  <text start="215.03" dur="6.36">the same diversion program that the</text>
  <text start="218.99" dur="4.11">shooter was was in you know basically</text>
  <text start="221.39" dur="2.82">was a big part of why the shooter was</text>
  <text start="223.1" dur="4.65">allowed to kill people he was in this</text>
  <text start="224.21" dur="5.66">program rather than in jail well it</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="4.32">turns out the Broward County</text>
  <text start="229.87" dur="4.18">diversionary school discipline program</text>
  <text start="232.07" dur="4.17">known as the promise program has gained</text>
  <text start="234.05" dur="5.19">scrutiny since the parkland shooting</text>
  <text start="236.24" dur="4.74">left 17 students dead the unstable</text>
  <text start="239.24" dur="3.93">shooter was identified as a prior</text>
  <text start="240.98" dur="4.19">benefactor of a County School District</text>
  <text start="243.17" dur="3.96">policy to reduce crime rates by</text>
  <text start="245.17" dur="3.61">exchanging criminal punishment for</text>
  <text start="247.13" dur="3.17">school discipline basically led the</text>
  <text start="248.78" dur="3.45">criminals off because they&amp;#39;re young</text>
  <text start="250.3" dur="4.42">because you don&amp;#39;t want to hurt you know</text>
  <text start="252.23" dur="6.21">have a bad score when people hear about</text>
  <text start="254.72" dur="5.579">him kind of sweeping this the problem</text>
  <text start="258.44" dur="3.51">under the rug messing with the</text>
  <text start="260.299" dur="3.271">statistics kind of government thing to</text>
  <text start="261.95" dur="5.04">do that does not solve the problem at</text>
  <text start="263.57" dur="5.55">all the case involved two seventeen year</text>
  <text start="266.99" dur="4.17">old students bullying a fourteen year</text>
  <text start="269.12" dur="4.439">old freshman with one holding down the</text>
  <text start="271.16" dur="4.919">younger boy by his ankles while the</text>
  <text start="273.559" dur="4.59">kicked the victim grabbed his genitals</text>
  <text start="276.079" dur="4.08">and then took the victims own baseball</text>
  <text start="278.149" dur="4.92">bat and began shoving it against his</text>
  <text start="280.159" dur="6.03">buttocks simulating rape through the</text>
  <text start="283.069" dur="4.74">boys clothes one of the assailants the</text>
  <text start="286.189" dur="5.25">boy who allegedly held down the victim</text>
  <text start="287.809" dur="5.67">was Sheriff Israel&amp;#39;s son and then he was</text>
  <text start="291.439" dur="7.44">on the same program that kept him out of</text>
  <text start="293.479" dur="7.77">jail as was the shooter so that&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="298.879" dur="4.73">interesting developments and I won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="301.249" dur="6.12">draw any conclusions though some may</text>
  <text start="303.609" dur="6.87">into the somewhat sexual nature of this</text>
  <text start="307.369" dur="5.31">assault you know in a world full of</text>
  <text start="310.479" dur="4">pedophiles and pedo gate and everything</text>
  <text start="312.679" dur="4.25">else and the known connections between</text>
  <text start="314.479" dur="5.64">Israel and you know the Clintons and</text>
  <text start="316.929" dur="5.41">powerful Democrats who knows right maybe</text>
  <text start="320.119" dur="3.57">he&amp;#39;s engaging with this with his own</text>
  <text start="322.339" dur="3.96">child and that&amp;#39;s why the child is</text>
  <text start="323.689" dur="5.01">engaging in sexual bullying that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="326.299" dur="4.05">conjecture I have no idea so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="328.699" dur="5.1">gonna I&amp;#39;m not gonna draw that connection</text>
  <text start="330.349" dur="7.08">but who knows maybe too many</text>
  <text start="333.799" dur="6.18">coincidences right and anti-shah they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="337.429" dur="3.98">been getting more in the news more</text>
  <text start="339.979" dur="3.66">lively lately I mean they&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="341.409" dur="3.701">excuse me they&amp;#39;ve always been there in</text>
  <text start="343.639" dur="4.56">the background they never went anywhere</text>
  <text start="345.11" dur="4.619">but you know the media kind of got quiet</text>
  <text start="348.199" dur="3.33">about it after Trump called the mountain</text>
  <text start="349.729" dur="3.15">Pelosi and others were sort of forced to</text>
  <text start="351.529" dur="4.44">admit yeah they&amp;#39;re sort of linked</text>
  <text start="352.879" dur="4.92">terrorists okay anyway so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="355.969" dur="3.72">calling for violence against upcoming</text>
  <text start="357.799" dur="3.42">pro-life demonstrations</text>
  <text start="359.689" dur="2.94">okay so there&amp;#39;s like a prayer thing</text>
  <text start="361.219" dur="5.1">where they&amp;#39;re going to demonstrate</text>
  <text start="362.629" dur="6.54">peacefully outside of a I think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="366.319" dur="4.56">an abortion clinic but at the same time</text>
  <text start="369.169" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re not targeting women</text>
  <text start="370.879" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re not being rude to anyone they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="372.259" dur="3.75">not they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re not going at it</text>
  <text start="374.809" dur="4.71">that way they&amp;#39;re just trying to offer</text>
  <text start="376.009" dur="6.57">support and information but anti-shah</text>
  <text start="379.519" dur="4.89">says use the same force as at Nazi</text>
  <text start="382.579" dur="3.9">rallies you know so basically show up</text>
  <text start="384.409" dur="5.19">and and beat the crap out of these</text>
  <text start="386.479" dur="5.31">peaceful prayer praying protestors you</text>
  <text start="389.599" dur="3.69">know I just hope someone gets it on</text>
  <text start="391.789" dur="2.7">camera because they they always shoot</text>
  <text start="393.289" dur="2.88">themselves in the foot when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="394.489" dur="4.91">caught on camera bullying people and</text>
  <text start="396.169" dur="3.23">that&amp;#39;s really what we need right now</text>
  <text start="399.78" dur="5.31">you know they say never let a good</text>
  <text start="401.949" dur="5.461">crisis go to waste well never let a good</text>
  <text start="405.09" dur="5.23">martyrdom go to waste on our team either</text>
  <text start="407.41" dur="4.229">because that is how you push the agenda</text>
  <text start="410.32" dur="4.409">through that is the tactics that you</text>
  <text start="411.639" dur="7.881">must play with that is the game that Q</text>
  <text start="414.729" dur="4.791">talks about this game of influence and</text>
  <text start="419.85" dur="7.39">moving on to this this moron lawyer</text>
  <text start="423.729" dur="6.091">avenatti I really am so done with this</text>
  <text start="427.24" dur="4.62">topic but he has now been accused by the</text>
  <text start="429.82" dur="4.14">courts of acting with a malice fraud and</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="5.089">oppression then he suddenly is basically</text>
  <text start="433.96" dur="5.459">gone from CNN and the MSM and he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="436.949" dur="3.25">everything&amp;#39;s quiet only avenatti front</text>
  <text start="439.419" dur="4.081">all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="440.199" dur="6.571">so remember he was trying to strong-arm</text>
  <text start="443.5" dur="5.699">and threatened a journalist to keep them</text>
  <text start="446.77" dur="4.05">from reporting on his his weird stuff</text>
  <text start="449.199" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s going on with his situation he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.82" dur="6.779">obviously in a precarious situation</text>
  <text start="453.039" dur="6.481">where he can be leveraged you know he</text>
  <text start="457.599" dur="3.75">needs he needs money he&amp;#39;s in debt he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="459.52" dur="3.899">having legal problems everything else so</text>
  <text start="461.349" dur="3.931">someone could use that to sort of</text>
  <text start="463.419" dur="3.541">control him and that could be what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="465.28" dur="3.66">happening I mean he&amp;#39;s probably just</text>
  <text start="466.96" dur="4.8">crooked anyway and just desperate for</text>
  <text start="468.94" dur="4.62">the money so he&amp;#39;s willing to to lie and</text>
  <text start="471.76" dur="5.33">probably knows that he&amp;#39;s lying</text>
  <text start="473.56" dur="6.09">I don&amp;#39;t know and there are ongoing</text>
  <text start="477.09" dur="4.24">protests over the arrest of Tommy</text>
  <text start="479.65" dur="4.739">Robinson hundreds of people have showed</text>
  <text start="481.33" dur="7.38">up to protest it this is very</text>
  <text start="484.389" dur="5.821">encouraging the details basically he he</text>
  <text start="488.71" dur="3.329">had been reporting on things before and</text>
  <text start="490.21" dur="4.799">he had gotten a suspended sentence and</text>
  <text start="492.039" dur="4.861">kind of like I guess not probation but</text>
  <text start="495.009" dur="4.951">just a suspended sentence I imagine and</text>
  <text start="496.9" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t get arrested again or</text>
  <text start="499.96" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;ll go to jail for this many months</text>
  <text start="501.46" dur="4.35">so they immediately activated that when</text>
  <text start="503.86" dur="3.63">he was arrested this time for simply</text>
  <text start="505.81" dur="3.78">reporting on the grooming gangs that</text>
  <text start="507.49" dur="5.969">target children with the drugs and rape</text>
  <text start="509.59" dur="6.36">and prostitution and in the UK I mean</text>
  <text start="513.459" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s thousands of children and no police</text>
  <text start="515.95" dur="3.209">action it&amp;#39;s really that bad and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="517.659" dur="5.07">not doing anything about it the Muslims</text>
  <text start="519.159" dur="6.3">have infiltrated the city councils and</text>
  <text start="522.729" dur="5.671">taken over many local governments in</text>
  <text start="525.459" dur="4.601">smaller areas when they get a certain</text>
  <text start="528.4" dur="4.51">percentage they will start to</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="6.62">drive out outsiders it becomes our</text>
  <text start="532.91" dur="6.75">balconies you start getting hostile</text>
  <text start="536.68" dur="5.26">settlements foreign culture that is not</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="4.7">willing to assimilate it&amp;#39;s like a cancer</text>
  <text start="541.94" dur="6.66">you know it&amp;#39;s not a healthy thing</text>
  <text start="544.36" dur="7.39">obviously not all Muslims are evil but</text>
  <text start="548.6" dur="5.91">the culture of prevailing you know the</text>
  <text start="551.75" dur="4.95">overall prevailing accepted culture of</text>
  <text start="554.51" dur="4.82">Islam is not compatible with Western</text>
  <text start="556.7" dur="4.889">values and is in fact openly hostile</text>
  <text start="559.33" dur="4.36">because there&amp;#39;s the house of war and</text>
  <text start="561.589" dur="4.291">there&amp;#39;s the house of Islam and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="563.69" dur="5.25">not in Islam you&amp;#39;re in the house of war</text>
  <text start="565.88" dur="7.38">and it&amp;#39;s important to understand that is</text>
  <text start="568.94" dur="6.839">the mainstream prevalent Muslim doctrine</text>
  <text start="573.26" dur="5.01">even in countries and Western nations</text>
  <text start="575.779" dur="3.901">many of them still want Sharia law now</text>
  <text start="578.27" dur="3.33">obviously not all there&amp;#39;s exceptions</text>
  <text start="579.68" dur="4.409">there some that even speak out against</text>
  <text start="581.6" dur="4.62">Sharia law but we don&amp;#39;t see nearly</text>
  <text start="584.089" dur="3.69">enough of that yet there&amp;#39;s definitely a</text>
  <text start="586.22" dur="5.49">cultural imbalance and they need to have</text>
  <text start="587.779" dur="6.271">some sort of a Reformation and Candice</text>
  <text start="591.71" dur="5.21">Owens in the culture category she says</text>
  <text start="594.05" dur="5.85">in no way do I endorse Farrakhan&amp;#39;s views</text>
  <text start="596.92" dur="5.32">but holy crap this is a really big deal</text>
  <text start="599.9" dur="4.89">he has just aligned himself with the</text>
  <text start="602.24" dur="4.98">trumps administration with trumps</text>
  <text start="604.79" dur="3.93">administration sorry and what is going</text>
