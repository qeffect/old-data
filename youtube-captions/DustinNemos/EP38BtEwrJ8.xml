  <text start="2341.81" dur="5.82">where we have the majority that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="2345.26" dur="3.87">have to once again lead the world in the</text>
  <text start="2347.63" dur="3.69">right path we have to set the example</text>
  <text start="2349.13" dur="4.92">for all others to follow and the cool</text>
  <text start="2351.32" dur="4.98">thing is that when we do that when we</text>
  <text start="2354.05" dur="4.97">set that example other nations will be</text>
  <text start="2356.3" dur="5.19">forced to follow by sheer competition</text>
  <text start="2359.02" dur="4.63">right if McDonald&amp;#39;s dropped their price</text>

  <text start="2365.03" dur="4.079">they&amp;#39;d go out of business it&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="2366.89" dur="3.63">the same situation here it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2369.109" dur="3.661">that little bit of capitalism that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2370.52" dur="4.17">left in a government world fighting to</text>
  <text start="2372.77" dur="4.53">help us make things better by</text>
  <text start="2374.69" dur="4.83">competition by giving people choices by</text>
  <text start="2377.3" dur="4.16">allowing people to voluntarily kind of</text>
  <text start="2379.52" dur="4.02">go where they want to go in this case</text>
  <text start="2381.46" dur="3.7">Americans will voluntarily stay in</text>
  <text start="2383.54" dur="3.51">America and not leave because of the</text>
  <text start="2385.16" dur="4.05">craziness they will build a better</text>
  <text start="2387.05" dur="3.33">country a better example for other</text>
  <text start="2389.21" dur="2.94">countries to follow in the other</text>
  <text start="2390.38" dur="3.36">countries will say look their system</text>
  <text start="2392.15" dur="3.87">works so well it&amp;#39;s doing so well for</text>
  <text start="2393.74" dur="3.629">them we should follow and the pressure</text>
  <text start="2396.02" dur="3.81">will mount and eventually you&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="2397.369" dur="4.5">change so despite all the the other</text>
  <text start="2399.83" dur="3.509">governments and such out there we can</text>
  <text start="2401.869" dur="3.72">actually do quite a bit of good for the</text>
  <text start="2403.339" dur="4.77">world by focusing on America first and</text>
  <text start="2405.589" dur="4.471">focusing on being the example that we</text>
  <text start="2408.109" dur="3.99">can be for others and in terms of</text>
  <text start="2410.06" dur="4.5">freedom in terms of natural rights and</text>
  <text start="2412.099" dur="5.621">human rights and human decency in terms</text>
  <text start="2414.56" dur="5.17">of of setting the sort of that</text>
  <text start="2417.72" dur="4.44">pattern of the world and the way that</text>
  <text start="2419.73" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re heading and also in terms of you</text>
  <text start="2422.16" dur="4.26">know the agenda everything so I think</text>
  <text start="2424.56" dur="3.06">that that&amp;#39;s the greatest gift of all for</text>
  <text start="2426.42" dur="3.09">president Trump I think that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="2427.62" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;re seeing nationalism surge across</text>
  <text start="2429.51" dur="3.75">the entire world people were waiting</text>
  <text start="2431.04" dur="4.98">they were there they were ready but now</text>
  <text start="2433.26" dur="5.61">they have something to to kind of get</text>
  <text start="2436.02" dur="4.38">behind and maybe it&amp;#39;s not always Trump</text>
  <text start="2438.87" dur="3.93">maybe it&amp;#39;s a volson arrow or someone</text>
  <text start="2440.4" dur="4.2">right it&amp;#39;s another Trump but those</text>
  <text start="2442.8" dur="3.96">nationalist populist figures are coming</text>
  <text start="2444.6" dur="4.86">to set things right</text>
  <text start="2446.76" dur="5.7">to fix the culture and to turn back the</text>
  <text start="2449.46" dur="4.05">clock in a sense so I think that&amp;#39;s it</text>
