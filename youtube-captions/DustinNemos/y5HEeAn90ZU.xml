  <text start="84.479" dur="3.871">our friendship and I&amp;#39;m really grateful</text>
  <text start="86.43" dur="4.32">for the opportunity that we had to meet</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="5.25">each other and to discuss I&amp;#39;ve sort of</text>
  <text start="90.75" dur="5.009">plumbing each other&amp;#39;s mental depths</text>
  <text start="93.6" dur="4.65">while we were in Tennessee working</text>
  <text start="95.759" dur="4.981">together I&amp;#39;ll give you just a little bit</text>
  <text start="98.25" dur="5.34">of background on myself I&amp;#39;m a pretty</text>
  <text start="100.74" dur="5.489">average person I suppose slightly weird</text>
  <text start="103.59" dur="5.04">but I know a lot of people who are in</text>
  <text start="106.229" dur="5.161">that same category so can&amp;#39;t claim any</text>
  <text start="108.63" dur="6.54">distinction with that but I I got into</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="6.45">business early in my life probably 21 22</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="5.309">years old and so I&amp;#39;ve here I am coming</text>
  <text start="117.84" dur="7.529">up on on 50th I think I&amp;#39;m about 48 now</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="7.62">and I have noticed some things as a</text>
  <text start="125.369" dur="5.131">business owner so it&amp;#39;s been about 20</text>
  <text start="128.099" dur="4.181">over 25 years that I&amp;#39;ve been in business</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="5.05">and in that time I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="132.28" dur="5.64">and that my interactions were with the</text>
  <text start="135.55" dur="5.67">government were always something to be</text>
  <text start="137.92" dur="6.75">either tolerated or completely avoided</text>
  <text start="141.22" dur="5.67">because in my experience government</text>
  <text start="144.67" dur="4.2">employees are not there to help me</text>
  <text start="146.89" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re not there to help my customers</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re not helping there to help really</text>
  <text start="151" dur="5.13">anybody in society that I could name</text>
  <text start="152.59" dur="7.08">except for those who are directly</text>
  <text start="156.13" dur="7.11">getting paid from funds that they would</text>
  <text start="159.67" dur="7.2">extort out of out of other people there</text>
  <text start="163.24" dur="6.27">was one of my old customers I I offered</text>
  <text start="166.87" dur="5.51">to fix his roof and I got threatened</text>
  <text start="169.51" dur="5.76">with a year in jail and a $5,000 fine</text>
  <text start="172.38" dur="4.06">for performing a voluntary contract</text>
  <text start="175.27" dur="6.21">between the two of us</text>
  <text start="176.44" dur="9.15">and so the circumstances like that have</text>
  <text start="181.48" dur="5.34">have pushed me more and more into well</text>
  <text start="185.59" dur="4.23">at first it pushed me into kind of</text>
  <text start="186.82" dur="7.68">bitterness and confusion I grew up in</text>
  <text start="189.82" dur="7.11">the LDS Church and I I want to say I</text>
  <text start="194.5" dur="5.459">I went AWOL or I escaped about eight</text>
  <text start="196.93" dur="5.339">years ago it&amp;#39;s a little bubble it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="199.959" dur="7.201">way of thinking religion is interesting</text>
  <text start="202.269" dur="6.72">I yeah I I believe that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="207.16" dur="4.889">something I called a meat grinder it</text>
  <text start="208.989" dur="5.491">consists of family and it consists of</text>
  <text start="212.049" dur="4.921">religion and it consists of government</text>
  <text start="214.48" dur="7.53">and we all pass through it on our way to</text>
  <text start="216.97" dur="8.22">adulthood and by the time we come out a</text>
  <text start="222.01" dur="5.88">lot of us are looking for medication to</text>
  <text start="225.19" dur="6.389">help with our mental state it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="227.89" dur="6.24">a miracle that we survive at all for</text>
  <text start="231.579" dur="5.491">sure so you know you and I have talked a</text>
  <text start="234.13" dur="5.73">lot and I think the wonderful thing is</text>
  <text start="237.07" dur="6.84">that both of us have the the mental</text>
  <text start="239.86" dur="5.969">ability even in our adulthood to look at</text>
  <text start="243.91" dur="4.32">our experiences and even though we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="245.829" dur="4.981">had some unpleasant ones we&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="248.23" dur="5.009">learn and to grow and to to prosper</text>
  <text start="250.81" dur="6.57">individually and then both of us are now</text>
  <text start="253.239" dur="6.451">interested in community you&amp;#39;ve developed</text>
  <text start="257.38" dur="3.9">a great community here Dustin just in a</text>
  <text start="259.69" dur="3.57">very short time I mean from the time</text>
  <text start="261.28" dur="3.949">that that we are working together out in</text>
  <text start="263.26" dur="6.2">Tennessee to now</text>
  <text start="265.229" dur="6.24">just very very few months what 20 20 30</text>
  <text start="269.46" dur="3.69">months something like that I started</text>
  <text start="271.469" dur="3.831">with a YouTube thing on Christmas Eve</text>
  <text start="273.15" dur="6.419">2017 so it&amp;#39;s not been that long at all</text>
  <text start="275.3" dur="6.28">yeah yeah so just over a year and you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="279.569" dur="4.32">done you&amp;#39;ve done an amazing thing and I</text>
  <text start="281.58" dur="5.1">and I&amp;#39;d like to say that it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="283.889" dur="6.06">your fantastic bringing in your talents</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="4.919">but I think both of us we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="289.949" dur="3.75">circumstance so I&amp;#39;m in I&amp;#39;m in the</text>
  <text start="291.599" dur="4.261">handyman business there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="293.699" dur="5.21">interesting phenomenon going on or I</text>
  <text start="295.86" dur="5.94">guess I should just say construction</text>
  <text start="298.909" dur="5.32">it&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re sitting on a gold mine</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="5.72">and both in the intellectual realm and</text>
  <text start="304.229" dur="6">in the in the construction realm</text>
  <text start="307.52" dur="6.1">regulation I believe has nearly</text>
  <text start="310.229" dur="6.24">destroyed the independent contractor in</text>
  <text start="313.62" dur="5.46">the United States of America and so what</text>
  <text start="316.469" dur="7.2">happens when someone feels he was able</text>
  <text start="319.08" dur="6.54">to do work it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like a man dying of</text>
  <text start="323.669" dur="4.291">thirst to find finding a little spring</text>
  <text start="325.62" dur="4.049">you know know they&amp;#39;ll glom onto you they</text>
  <text start="327.96" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t want to let go they can&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="329.669" dur="5.881">that they found you it and I&amp;#39;m serious</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="4.139">Dustin it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s that crazy we&amp;#39;ll find</text>
  <text start="335.55" dur="4.47">people who have been looking for six</text>
  <text start="337.469" dur="4.5">months for even someone to show up to</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="3.989">give them a bid well that that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="341.969" dur="3.75">government has such a sort of a grip on</text>
  <text start="344.009" dur="3.481">those who are dependent on them I mean</text>
  <text start="345.719" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s why they want to push that sort</text>
  <text start="347.49" dur="4.949">of dependency at least the left because</text>
  <text start="349.439" dur="6.331">obviously you you you don&amp;#39;t bite the</text>
  <text start="352.439" dur="4.98">hand that feeds you right so they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="355.77" dur="3.78">actually created an environment where a</text>
  <text start="357.419" dur="4.441">few profit insanely I mean hire a</text>
  <text start="359.55" dur="3.66">plumber that&amp;#39;s licensed it insured and</text>
  <text start="361.86" dur="4.679">see how much they charge you to change</text>
  <text start="363.21" dur="5.549">your toilet or to you know to fix a</text>
  <text start="366.539" dur="5.91">leaky faucet you know it&amp;#39;s hundreds and</text>
  <text start="368.759" dur="6.39">hundreds of dollars yeah and and the</text>
  <text start="372.449" dur="4.08">idea of course the from the sort of the</text>
  <text start="375.149" dur="3.121">devil&amp;#39;s advocate here and it certainly</text>
  <text start="376.529" dur="4.801">is kind of my opinion a devil on the</text>
  <text start="378.27" dur="4.709">government but and I don&amp;#39;t make bones</text>
  <text start="381.33" dur="4.98">about it people know I&amp;#39;m the voluntary</text>
  <text start="382.979" dur="5.791">us but my problem with it is although</text>
  <text start="386.31" dur="4.259">they they use the argument that it&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="388.77" dur="5.069">protect people and is to improve quality</text>
  <text start="390.569" dur="5.13">and such in an actual practice they</text>
  <text start="393.839" dur="3.991">rarely even really inspect these things</text>
  <text start="395.699" dur="3.211">they don&amp;#39;t really add any value at all</text>
  <text start="397.83" dur="3.12">to the end customer</text>
  <text start="398.91" dur="3.24">but they double the price and that puts</text>
  <text start="400.95" dur="2.97">a lot of people just on the street</text>
  <text start="402.15" dur="3.78">homeless because they can&amp;#39;t afford it it</text>
  <text start="403.92" dur="3.72">raises the cost of living for everyone</text>
  <text start="405.93" dur="4.53">it raises the cost of getting anything</text>
  <text start="407.64" dur="4.5">fixed you know you can&amp;#39;t screw your own</text>
  <text start="410.46" dur="4.05">light bulb in suddenly you have to bring</text>
  <text start="412.14" dur="5.34">in someone to do it at sixty an hour you</text>
  <text start="414.51" dur="5.4">know so it&amp;#39;s just a control mechanism</text>
  <text start="417.48" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s just an enslavement system for sure</text>
  <text start="419.91" dur="6.33">Oh Dustin it&amp;#39;s so fun talking to someone</text>
  <text start="423.12" dur="6">like you because I feel like while there</text>

  <text start="448.44" dur="7.38">I&amp;#39;ll just go out on a limb and just say</text>
  <text start="451.13" dur="6.79">that that I&amp;#39;m working in the so this</text>
  <text start="455.82" dur="4.92">creates every time you make something</text>

  <text start="491.4" dur="5.73">as we look at the things that we have to</text>
  <text start="493.77" dur="6.8">put up with just to do what we need to</text>
  <text start="497.13" dur="6.99">to make our life as happy as it can be</text>
  <text start="500.57" dur="5.86">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s also very clear that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.12" dur="3.81">some some steps that we can take there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.43" dur="4.44">some things that are broken that we can</text>
  <text start="507.93" dur="6.12">fix and so while there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s doom</text>
  <text start="510.87" dur="5.79">and gloom all around on the other hand</text>
  <text start="514.05" dur="5.58">I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m more excited about life in ever</text>
  <text start="516.66" dur="5.9">because we&amp;#39;re riding a wave of</text>
  <text start="519.63" dur="5.1">Technology of exponential growth of</text>
  <text start="522.56" dur="3.88">basically free stuff the things that</text>

  <text start="528.56" dur="8.7">you know we&amp;#39;re stuck in this in this</text>
  <text start="531.76" dur="8.38">sort of a miasma a fog of entitlement</text>
  <text start="537.26" dur="5.43">and and you know you&amp;#39;ve got places like</text>
  <text start="540.14" dur="5.49">CNN institutions like CNN the crisis</text>
  <text start="542.69" dur="5.13">news network who are focused on the</text>
  <text start="545.63" dur="4.74">worst things they can find and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.82" dur="4.89">published they&amp;#39;re publishing that as if</text>

  <text start="552.71" dur="5.879">they&amp;#39;ve been very successful in selling</text>
  <text start="555.44" dur="5.67">the scarcity worldview but I&amp;#39;ve tapped</text>
  <text start="558.589" dur="5.25">into what I&amp;#39;ve just seen in my personal</text>
  <text start="561.11" dur="5.22">life and as I see other other producers</text>
  <text start="563.839" dur="5.071">around me I&amp;#39;m blown away at how abundant</text>

  <text start="568.91" dur="4.5">productivity is and what it what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.89" dur="4.62">capable of if we if we&amp;#39;ll just look</text>
  <text start="573.41" dur="4.2">really it&amp;#39;s like the Big Short they</text>
  <text start="575.51" dur="6.21">talked about how the people that saw the</text>
  <text start="577.61" dur="5.85">housing crisis coming in 2008 the key to</text>
  <text start="581.72" dur="3.99">their success was that they simply</text>

  <text start="591.23" dur="4.47">as they looked they saw this this</text>
  <text start="593.24" dur="4.29">terrible crisis approaching and they</text>
  <text start="595.7" dur="4.86">were able to profit from it by shorting</text>
  <text start="597.53" dur="6.15">the housing market in the same way we</text>

  <text start="702.44" dur="3.12">you&amp;#39;ve extended the invitation to me to</text>
  <text start="704.03" dur="3.39">discuss some philosophy and I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="705.56" dur="4.77">to think what would be of the greatest</text>
  <text start="707.42" dur="4.74">help one of the things that inspired me</text>
  <text start="710.33" dur="4.71">most to get into philosophy was the book</text>
  <text start="712.16" dur="7.62">Atlas Shrugged yeah and I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="715.04" dur="7.41">people have heard a pretty actually a</text>
  <text start="719.78" dur="5.61">pretty vicious story about the author</text>
  <text start="722.45" dur="6.93">Iran and about some of her philosophies</text>
  <text start="725.39" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;ve been couched in absolute well</text>
  <text start="729.38" dur="5.91">the Communists have matched it with</text>
  <text start="731.18" dur="6.3">their usual I hate yeah yeah anti anti</text>
  <text start="735.29" dur="3.6">truth rhetoric crouched in moralism</text>
  <text start="737.48" dur="3">calling it hate speech that kind of</text>
  <text start="738.89" dur="4.01">thing just like they do with Trump and</text>
  <text start="740.48" dur="5.49">people are aware that of that tactic now</text>
  <text start="742.9" dur="5.62">so Dustin your success I wanted to point</text>
  <text start="745.97" dur="5.28">out that you know while you bring your</text>
  <text start="748.52" dur="6">skills to this marketplace of social</text>
  <text start="751.25" dur="6.51">media and intellectual discussion you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="757.76" dur="6.06">won&amp;#39;t say that regulation but I&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="759.53" dur="6.12">I&amp;#39;ll say socialism that I hate to use</text>
  <text start="763.82" dur="4.41">these terms because they&amp;#39;re so the</text>
  <text start="765.65" dur="4.47">definitions have been so twisted but</text>
  <text start="768.23" dur="4.41">well no you can define the measure as</text>
  <text start="770.12" dur="5.51">some people know well let&amp;#39;s go ahead and</text>
  <text start="772.64" dur="5.97">do it so there&amp;#39;s a key there&amp;#39;s a key</text>
  <text start="775.63" dur="6.72">moral philosophy and that is property</text>
  <text start="778.61" dur="6.6">private property it starts with our body</text>
  <text start="782.35" dur="5.2">we we are the ones who control our body</text>
  <text start="785.21" dur="4.02">I mean obviously I could I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="787.55" dur="3.72">maybe you&amp;#39;re a lot tougher than I am so</text>
  <text start="789.23" dur="4.17">I might have to sedate you but I could</text>
  <text start="791.27" dur="3.49">move your arms and legs against your</text>
  <text start="793.4" dur="4.15">will for a short time</text>
  <text start="794.76" dur="4.89">but ultimately I don&amp;#39;t control Dustin</text>
  <text start="797.55" dur="4.14">freewill that&amp;#39;s right you have your</text>
  <text start="799.65" dur="5.58">freewill and it&amp;#39;s very difficult for me</text>
  <text start="801.69" dur="6.06">to try to overcome your freewill so by</text>
  <text start="805.23" dur="5.34">default you on your body I think that</text>
  <text start="807.75" dur="5.01">part force is involved sure right well</text>
  <text start="810.57" dur="3.42">for a short time we can try to work</text>
  <text start="812.76" dur="4.02">against that but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="813.99" dur="6">overwhelming overwhelmingly self-evident</text>
  <text start="816.78" dur="7.46">that ownership of our bodies is is</text>
  <text start="819.99" dur="6.87">universally accepted in every culture -</text>
  <text start="824.24" dur="4.81">yes I mean obviously there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="826.86" dur="5.37">been inroads against that but the</text>
  <text start="829.05" dur="6.78">concept of private property leads to to</text>
  <text start="832.23" dur="6.12">economic policies one economic policy is</text>
  <text start="835.83" dur="5.94">based on the existence of private</text>
  <text start="838.35" dur="6.27">property and that&amp;#39;s initially been</text>
  <text start="841.77" dur="4.35">called laissez-faire capitalism the idea</text>
  <text start="844.62" dur="2.76">is that you own your your body therefore</text>
  <text start="846.12" dur="3.18">the things that you do with your body</text>
  <text start="847.38" dur="4.02">and your time and your labor your talent</text>
  <text start="849.3" dur="4.11">your your inspiration your uniqueness</text>
  <text start="851.4" dur="3.84">those things would then also belong to</text>
  <text start="853.41" dur="3.21">you and and to violate these things</text>
  <text start="855.24" dur="2.76">would also be akin to sort of like</text>
  <text start="856.62" dur="4.53">violating your body and therefore like</text>
  <text start="858" dur="5.34">sort of a economic form of rape you know</text>
  <text start="861.15" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s a very good analogy and I hate to</text>
  <text start="863.34" dur="6.15">use the word capitalism because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="865.14" dur="7.86">been so high dragon by mind by those who</text>
  <text start="869.49" dur="7.77">are threatened by the the very existence</text>
  <text start="873" dur="6.99">of of the idea of private property well</text>
  <text start="877.26" dur="4.83">they live off a force and coercion and</text>
  <text start="879.99" dur="3.66">and deception and sort of that like</text>
  <text start="882.09" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;d like to cloak what they do in</text>
  <text start="883.65" dur="4.95">moralism but what they really do is they</text>
  <text start="886.2" dur="3.75">just use force and still from one to</text>
  <text start="888.6" dur="3.48">give to another of course they keep most</text>
  <text start="889.95" dur="3.87">of it but you know before we even jump</text>
  <text start="892.08" dur="3.33">in all of this I think I just thought of</text>
  <text start="893.82" dur="3.45">the name for the video as well I would</text>
  <text start="895.41" dur="4.64">that was kind of I was struggling with</text>
  <text start="897.27" dur="6.39">it but something along the lines of</text>
  <text start="900.05" dur="5.56">philosophy our ancestors weapon against</text>
  <text start="903.66" dur="3.3">tyranny because that&amp;#39;s really what it is</text>
  <text start="905.61" dur="3.21">and that&amp;#39;s what people like people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="906.96" dur="4.2">think it&amp;#39;s cool it&amp;#39;s not fun like no one</text>
  <text start="908.82" dur="3.69">wants to learn about philosophy but you</text>
  <text start="911.16" dur="3.51">really get down to the essence of it</text>
  <text start="912.51" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s the wisdom that was passed down to</text>
  <text start="914.67" dur="5.61">you know all people from some of the</text>
  <text start="917.7" dur="4.05">greatest minds on earth with the general</text>
  <text start="920.28" dur="4.73">idea of just making the world a better</text>
  <text start="921.75" dur="6.1">place and less susceptible to tyranny I</text>
  <text start="925.01" dur="6.29">like it and it&amp;#39;s interesting because</text>
  <text start="927.85" dur="6.33">Lassa fee there&amp;#39;s another subject which</text>
  <text start="931.3" dur="6.69">is economics these two these two</text>
  <text start="934.18" dur="5.94">Sciences have been sophisticated they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="937.99" dur="5.849">there are people with vested interests</text>
  <text start="940.12" dur="6.389">in making those subjects seem very</text>
  <text start="943.839" dur="4.98">confusing and the funny thing is we have</text>
  <text start="946.509" dur="4.08">an instinctual understanding of both of</text>
  <text start="948.819" dur="4.651">those things one because of our bodies</text>
  <text start="950.589" dur="4.411">and two because of our interactions with</text>
  <text start="953.47" dur="3.78">other people we have a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="955" dur="5.069">data that gives us an instinctive</text>
  <text start="957.25" dur="5.37">economic understanding and we have our</text>
  <text start="960.069" dur="5.491">bodies which tells us in no uncertain</text>
  <text start="962.62" dur="4.709">terms that private property is a thing</text>
  <text start="965.56" dur="4.62">and it gives us an instinctive</text>
  <text start="967.329" dur="5.82">understanding of theft I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="970.18" dur="5.219">I do like the name do not I won&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="973.149" dur="4.5">won&amp;#39;t object to that at all that sounds</text>
  <text start="975.399" dur="4.8">like a great approach the other the</text>
  <text start="977.649" dur="4.651">people that you are talking about I want</text>
  <text start="980.199" dur="4.32">to I want to label them as well and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="982.3" dur="5.7">just gonna call them socialists because</text>
  <text start="984.519" dur="6.87">socialism it&amp;#39;s funny I growing up in the</text>
  <text start="988" dur="5.16">Mormon Church we were taught that the</text>
  <text start="991.389" dur="4.89">path to knowledge was to cuddle up next</text>
  <text start="993.16" dur="5.099">to God as closely as you could get and I</text>
  <text start="996.279" dur="3.841">hate to put it as bluntly as that but</text>
  <text start="998.259" dur="3.45">what it did for me anyway I know other</text>
  <text start="1000.12" dur="3.569">people have a much healthier approach to</text>
  <text start="1001.709" dur="4.951">religion but we&amp;#39;re pretty hardcore</text>
  <text start="1003.689" dur="5.221">Orthodox and I know everybody picks the</text>
  <text start="1006.66" dur="3.9">parts of a religion that make the most</text>
  <text start="1008.91" dur="3.029">sense to them and they disregard the</text>
  <text start="1010.56" dur="5.519">other parts so nobody&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="1011.939" dur="7.5">Orthodox but in in my in my circumstance</text>
  <text start="1016.079" dur="6.271">it led me away from philosophy away from</text>
  <text start="1019.439" dur="5.581">science because I was taught that God</text>
  <text start="1022.35" dur="5.339">knows everything and why would I waste</text>
  <text start="1025.02" dur="4.2">my time trying to rediscover something</text>
  <text start="1027.689" dur="4.23">on my own when I could just tap into</text>
  <text start="1029.22" dur="4.199">God&amp;#39;s mind and understand all the truths</text>
  <text start="1031.919" dur="3.571">of the universe you know I&amp;#39;ve always</text>

  <text start="1035.49" dur="3.089">thought I&amp;#39;ve had a problem with that</text>
  <text start="1036.839" dur="2.97">like obviously I&amp;#39;m agnostic and such but</text>
  <text start="1038.579" dur="3.301">I have a great respect for for</text>
  <text start="1039.809" dur="3.75">Christianity and and sort of the values</text>

  <text start="1043.559" dur="3.39">including some of those like values of</text>
  <text start="1045.179" dur="3.901">free speech and truth and such and the</text>
  <text start="1046.949" dur="4.021">end of slavery so like there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1049.08" dur="4.41">good cultural historical lessons there</text>
  <text start="1050.97" dur="4.05">for at least but I&amp;#39;ve always had a</text>
  <text start="1053.49" dur="4.559">problem with that sort of false meekness</text>
  <text start="1055.02" dur="5.88">of like of be small and and sort of be a</text>

  <text start="1069.36" dur="5.58">and ends with kind of you know like</text>
  <text start="1072.33" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s that idea of it&amp;#39;s good to be</text>

  <text start="1076.65" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t think that helps and I think if</text>
  <text start="1079.08" dur="4.62">people hide behind that as an excuse</text>
  <text start="1080.52" dur="5.51">when really they should shine well the</text>

  <text start="1093.78" dur="7.05">a it can be one of the most destructive</text>

  <text start="1194.95" dur="4.709">want to add to that like I think our</text>
  <text start="1196.45" dur="5.49">mission really is is to demystify but</text>
  <text start="1199.659" dur="5.37">also to make it clear to people that</text>
  <text start="1201.94" dur="4.739">here&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s useful it&amp;#39;s kind of like</text>
  <text start="1205.029" dur="4.56">the cue movement like I&amp;#39;m big into that</text>
  <text start="1206.679" dur="6.03">it gives you a set of tools to use</text>
  <text start="1209.589" dur="4.77">against evil deception tyranny and it</text>
  <text start="1212.709" dur="3.63">also kind of on the good end the</text>
  <text start="1214.359" dur="4.41">positive less combative and it gives you</text>
  <text start="1216.339" dur="4.47">a set of tools to know your neighbor to</text>

  <text start="1226.149" dur="2.88">you and I are voluntary ously you know</text>
  <text start="1227.95" dur="3.87">we follow the non-aggression principle</text>
  <text start="1229.029" dur="5.31">we believe you know aggression force is</text>
  <text start="1231.82" dur="4.139">wrong and let&amp;#39;s accept in defense you</text>
  <text start="1234.339" dur="3.481">know and we believe in the free market</text>
  <text start="1235.959" dur="3.42">as sort of as an extension of your own</text>
  <text start="1237.82" dur="3.209">body and your own private property so</text>
  <text start="1239.379" dur="3.45">you know you and I are on the same page</text>
  <text start="1241.029" dur="5.161">there we may disagree on on some</text>
  <text start="1242.829" dur="5.7">semantics or details but you just kind</text>
  <text start="1246.19" dur="5.189">of to explain some of those concepts to</text>
  <text start="1248.529" dur="4.83">people I guess yeah it&amp;#39;s I think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1251.379" dur="4.02">really great purpose because there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1253.359" dur="5.04">much suffering Dustin that happens we</text>
  <text start="1255.399" dur="5.671">were just defining two economic systems</text>
  <text start="1258.399" dur="4.44">one is capitalism it&amp;#39;s the economic</text>
  <text start="1261.07" dur="4.769">system based on the idea that private</text>
  <text start="1262.839" dur="5.851">property exists and and that we have a</text>
  <text start="1265.839" dur="5.67">right to it if see there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1268.69" dur="4.349">assumption in there um I I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1271.509" dur="4.52">actually believe in any form of</text>
  <text start="1273.039" dur="6.45">universal ethics without a purpose</text>
  <text start="1276.029" dur="5.65">without an objective so to have an</text>
  <text start="1279.489" dur="5.701">objective morality you have to have an</text>
  <text start="1281.679" dur="5.82">objective you have to have purpose and I</text>
  <text start="1285.19" dur="5.969">think that&amp;#39;s very key to what we might</text>
  <text start="1287.499" dur="7.83">discuss because I believe that in our in</text>
  <text start="1291.159" dur="7.98">our crazy political frenzy of a society</text>
  <text start="1295.329" dur="6.121">right now um some of these basics have</text>
  <text start="1299.139" dur="4.65">been lost to the point where I think we</text>
  <text start="1301.45" dur="3.99">could challenge people in their approach</text>
  <text start="1303.789" dur="4.95">to various issues and we can ask them</text>
  <text start="1305.44" dur="7.079">listen what is your purpose what would</text>
  <text start="1308.739" dur="6.81">you say if I said my purpose was to live</text>
  <text start="1312.519" dur="4.961">in peace with you in society and for</text>
  <text start="1315.549" dur="3.371">both of us to prosper</text>
  <text start="1317.48" dur="4.95">would you say that you shared that</text>
  <text start="1318.92" dur="5.46">purpose as well and I think if we can</text>
  <text start="1322.43" dur="5.4">get people to be honest I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="1324.38" dur="5.31">them if they if they could look into</text>
  <text start="1327.83" dur="4.02">their own motives they would notice that</text>
  <text start="1329.69" dur="5.43">that is not their purpose that their</text>
  <text start="1331.85" dur="4.92">purpose is to win a tribal battle yeah</text>
  <text start="1335.12" dur="3.48">they don&amp;#39;t have a win-win philosophy</text>
  <text start="1336.77" dur="3.78">they have a win-lose philosophy and</text>
  <text start="1338.6" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s something worth challenging</text>
  <text start="1340.55" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s something worth fixing and I</text>
  <text start="1342.35" dur="4.59">believe that we yeah you hit something</text>
  <text start="1345.59" dur="3.9">big there I&amp;#39;m sorry go ahead and finish</text>
  <text start="1346.94" dur="4.41">but I want to comment on that yeah I</text>
  <text start="1349.49" dur="3.57">just wanted to say I believe that we</text>
  <text start="1351.35" dur="3.93">could make some some very serious</text>
  <text start="1353.06" dur="3.36">progress maybe not with everybody but we</text>
  <text start="1355.28" dur="5.01">could help some people</text>
  <text start="1356.42" dur="6">I remember thinking when I was a 13 or</text>
  <text start="1360.29" dur="4.17">14 year old kid I had this moment of</text>

  <text start="1401.12" dur="6.02">problems and if you don&amp;#39;t mind I want to</text>
  <text start="1403.16" dur="7.08">comment on that win win win lose thing</text>
  <text start="1407.14" dur="4.24">go ahead um I was gonna say to what you</text>
  <text start="1410.24" dur="4.65">had said because that really was</text>
  <text start="1411.38" dur="5.22">important to mention every system out</text>
  <text start="1414.89" dur="4.14">there known at least known to me but I</text>
  <text start="1416.6" dur="4.86">think known to man in general runs on a</text>
  <text start="1419.03" dur="4.08">win-lose basis except capitalism and</text>
  <text start="1421.46" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s the one system that gets the most</text>
  <text start="1423.11" dur="4.2">flak and hate just like Trump because</text>
  <text start="1425.66" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s the one system that is the greatest</text>
  <text start="1427.31" dur="5.28">threat to eagle and capitalism is the</text>
  <text start="1430.64" dur="4.77">one system that takes a human beings</text>
  <text start="1432.59" dur="4.71">natural inherent selfish self-serving</text>
  <text start="1435.41" dur="4.26">greediness which we all have to some</text>
  <text start="1437.3" dur="3.69">degree even the best of us who just want</text>
  <text start="1439.67" dur="4.38">to help people and would do it for free</text>
  <text start="1440.99" dur="4.65">if we could everyone is sort still sort</text>
  <text start="1444.05" dur="3.27">of seeing life through the lens of</text>
  <text start="1445.64" dur="4.29">themselves and they have that selfish</text>
  <text start="1447.32" dur="3.469">perspective it&amp;#39;s the one system that</text>
  <text start="1449.93" dur="3.439">turns</text>
  <text start="1450.789" dur="6">in truth into and helping other people</text>
  <text start="1453.369" dur="5.19">in an altruistic fashion as a win-win so</text>
  <text start="1456.789" dur="4.14">that everybody is better off for it and</text>
  <text start="1458.559" dur="4.02">that system is a precious thing and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1460.929" dur="3.391">it&amp;#39;s really not even compatible with</text>
  <text start="1462.579" dur="3.66">government at all because government</text>
  <text start="1464.32" dur="7.139">always gets involved and always corrupts</text>
  <text start="1466.239" dur="7.56">the process definitely so we defined a</text>
  <text start="1471.459" dur="6.93">little bit the economic system based on</text>
  <text start="1473.799" dur="6.03">the the ownership of property that that</text>
  <text start="1478.389" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re calling that capitalism and I know</text>
  <text start="1479.829" dur="5.1">people have labeled that capitalism as</text>
  <text start="1482.079" dur="4.83">many things other than that so if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1484.929" dur="3.42">gonna use capitalism I would love to you</text>
  <text start="1486.909" dur="3.45">or you know that&amp;#39;s why the term</text>
  <text start="1488.349" dur="5.25">volunteerism has come out because</text>
  <text start="1490.359" dur="5.43">sometimes that that means even better</text>
  <text start="1493.599" dur="4.56">but but I think it&amp;#39;s useful just to</text>
  <text start="1495.789" dur="6.47">point out that the the opposite end of</text>
  <text start="1498.159" dur="7.68">the spectrum is is the philosophy that</text>
  <text start="1502.259" dur="4.96">you do not own yourself and and people</text>
  <text start="1505.839" dur="2.67">will push back on that they&amp;#39;ll say oh no</text>
  <text start="1507.219" dur="3.03">of course you do you own yourself you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1508.509" dur="3.42">on your body the greater good philosophy</text>
  <text start="1510.249" dur="4.65">because that&amp;#39;s what they always cloak it</text>
  <text start="1511.929" dur="6.21">in well and it&amp;#39;s kind of an incremental</text>
  <text start="1514.899" dur="4.56">ownership so that&amp;#39;s why I stay ownership</text>
  <text start="1518.139" dur="3.44">of your stuff it&amp;#39;s either a hundred</text>
  <text start="1519.459" dur="5.91">percent or it&amp;#39;s nothing you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1521.579" dur="7.65">incrementally own another person so so</text>
  <text start="1525.369" dur="6.9">what they will try to sell us is that</text>
  <text start="1529.229" dur="5.23">that maybe you own yourself ninety</text>
  <text start="1532.269" dur="4.59">percent and and the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="1534.459" dur="4.5">somehow owns 10 percent of you or even</text>
  <text start="1536.859" dur="4.5">one percent or maybe 50 percent of you</text>
  <text start="1538.959" dur="4.17">and by the social contract right yeah</text>
  <text start="1541.359" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;ll believe it&amp;#39;s social contract but</text>
  <text start="1543.129" dur="7.05">here&amp;#39;s the thing if you are not willing</text>
  <text start="1548.019" dur="4.86">to deal with someone voluntarily if</text>
  <text start="1550.179" dur="4.68">you&amp;#39;re willing to initiate force to get</text>
  <text start="1552.879" dur="4.98">them to bend to your will and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1554.859" dur="5.82">talking about retaliation the the moral</text>
  <text start="1557.859" dur="5.16">code associated with capitalism allows</text>
  <text start="1560.679" dur="4.56">fully for retaliation for justice to</text>
  <text start="1563.019" dur="4.02">protect your property but I&amp;#39;m told I</text>
  <text start="1565.239" dur="3.84">would argue by the way is a necessary</text>
  <text start="1567.039" dur="5.73">element to prevent evil because you need</text>
  <text start="1569.079" dur="5.19">some time right and so so the we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1572.769" dur="3.66">talking about the initiation of force</text>
  <text start="1574.269" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re saying listen this my neighbor</text>
  <text start="1576.429" dur="2.91">he&amp;#39;s not willing to support this</text>
  <text start="1578.049" dur="3.27">swimming pool I think this swimming pool</text>
  <text start="1579.339" dur="4.41">will be great for my kids or my kids</text>
  <text start="1581.319" dur="2.72">need an education or or I think we need</text>
  <text start="1583.749" dur="3.65">to get</text>
  <text start="1584.039" dur="4.801">a few more police on the force but but</text>
  <text start="1587.399" dur="4.11">my neighbor won&amp;#39;t support these</text>
  <text start="1588.84" dur="6.12">wonderful noble causes let&amp;#39;s go ahead</text>
  <text start="1591.509" dur="6.36">and end and vote will use democracy</text>
  <text start="1594.96" dur="4.919">and will will create a brute squad to</text>
  <text start="1597.869" dur="4.29">force this this neighbor of mine this</text>
  <text start="1599.879" dur="5.4">recalcitrant neighbor to do what&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="1602.159" dur="6.031">in my opinion so the moral code then</text>
  <text start="1605.279" dur="5.61">becomes law and you have an immoral army</text>
  <text start="1608.19" dur="5.789">of police officers and politicians and</text>
  <text start="1610.889" dur="5.49">judges and lawyers who will fight to</text>
  <text start="1613.979" dur="4.711">uphold this a moral code and I say a</text>
  <text start="1616.379" dur="3.691">mall because because of the philosophy</text>
  <text start="1618.69" dur="2.88">they were born into and that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="1620.07" dur="3.419">important it is they actually think that</text>
  <text start="1621.57" dur="4.099">they&amp;#39;re in the right to use force to</text>
  <text start="1623.489" dur="4.5">control people for the greater good</text>
  <text start="1625.669" dur="4.72">concept right</text>
  <text start="1627.989" dur="7.01">right so I&amp;#39;m gonna label as a socialist</text>
  <text start="1630.389" dur="7.561">anyone who acts to violate that</text>
  <text start="1634.999" dur="4.451">voluntary code then the non-aggression</text>
  <text start="1637.95" dur="3.899">non-aggression principle if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1639.45" dur="3.689">willing to force someone else to bend to</text>
  <text start="1641.849" dur="3.481">their will if they&amp;#39;re willing to</text>
  <text start="1643.139" dur="5.34">initiate force and they&amp;#39;re socialists</text>
  <text start="1645.33" dur="4.799">and really what if it were as clear is</text>
  <text start="1648.479" dur="4.351">that that would be amazing but here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1650.129" dur="4.41">the being for people first of all I want</text>
  <text start="1652.83" dur="4.649">to define kind of social contract but</text>
  <text start="1654.539" dur="5.01">before we move on but secondly like the</text>
  <text start="1657.479" dur="3.69">little old lady at the toll right like</text>
  <text start="1659.549" dur="3.84">the toll booth I ran into like four or</text>
  <text start="1661.169" dur="4.35">five tolls in a row and an hour drive it</text>
  <text start="1663.389" dur="3.6">was ridiculous I was so irritated and I</text>
  <text start="1665.519" dur="3.66">just thought you&amp;#39;d you damn Road pirates</text>
  <text start="1666.989" dur="3.54">but these are just a mostly a little old</text>
  <text start="1669.179" dur="3.511">ladies like they don&amp;#39;t realize that</text>
  <text start="1670.529" dur="3.811">they&amp;#39;re actually enforcing the system</text>
  <text start="1672.69" dur="2.969">that like if you were to just run by</text>
  <text start="1674.34" dur="2.759">there and you just ignored all that</text>
  <text start="1675.659" dur="3.33">somebody with a gun would have it you</text>
  <text start="1677.099" dur="3.78">show up at your house you know they</text>
  <text start="1678.989" dur="4.591">don&amp;#39;t even connect that that&amp;#39;s sort of I</text>
  <text start="1680.879" dur="4.77">think why they don&amp;#39;t teach philosophy in</text>
  <text start="1683.58" dur="4.589">schools and and and the social contract</text>
  <text start="1685.649" dur="5.22">thing just real briefly you know to</text>
  <text start="1688.169" dur="4.89">clarify it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the idea that well</text>
  <text start="1690.869" dur="3.601">look you&amp;#39;re part of society so if you</text>
  <text start="1693.059" dur="2.43">don&amp;#39;t like it you can leave although</text>
  <text start="1694.47" dur="2.85">that&amp;#39;s not really an option because</text>
  <text start="1695.489" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s nowhere that a man can go to be</text>
  <text start="1697.32" dur="4.5">free necessarily but the idea is that</text>
  <text start="1699.509" dur="4.53">because you&amp;#39;re here and you were born</text>
  <text start="1701.82" dur="6.329">near me and in the same you know</text>
  <text start="1704.039" dur="6.56">vicinity you can sort of tell me what to</text>
  <text start="1708.149" dur="4.95">do I guess or I can tell you what to do</text>
  <text start="1710.599" dur="4.231">and you have to pay these taxes you have</text>
  <text start="1713.099" dur="4.55">two qualities rules or</text>
  <text start="1714.83" dur="5.67">or I can hurt you because of the numbers</text>
  <text start="1717.649" dur="5.52">of my group and therefore the greater</text>
  <text start="1720.5" dur="4.98">good is always invoked to to violate</text>
  <text start="1723.169" dur="4.441">your rights that&amp;#39;s sort of like really</text>
  <text start="1725.48" dur="3.78">all of history most of history recently</text>
  <text start="1727.61" dur="4.62">at least is sort of this battle between</text>
  <text start="1729.26" dur="4.889">the individual and and the collective</text>
  <text start="1732.23" dur="3.24">and the tyrants always use the</text>
  <text start="1734.149" dur="5.01">collective they always use the greater</text>
  <text start="1735.47" dur="5.85">good concept to pitch the tyranny</text>
  <text start="1739.159" dur="3.421">whereas the individuals are always the</text>
  <text start="1741.32" dur="2.52">target of the flack you know the</text>
  <text start="1742.58" dur="2.189">capitalists take all the flack but</text>
  <text start="1743.84" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re the ones doing all the work</text>
  <text start="1744.769" dur="4.02">fixing society changing problems or</text>
  <text start="1746.84" dur="3.87">solving problems and changing things for</text>
  <text start="1748.789" dur="4.23">the better and making people more free</text>
  <text start="1750.71" dur="4.89">and trying to do win-win solutions so</text>
  <text start="1753.019" dur="3.63">sorry to drag on there for a second I</text>
  <text start="1755.6" dur="2.97">just want to make sure people understood</text>
  <text start="1756.649" dur="3.39">this no problem</text>
  <text start="1758.57" dur="2.88">Dustin I&amp;#39;m hoping that the recording</text>
  <text start="1760.039" dur="4.291">went well you cut out a couple of times</text>
  <text start="1761.45" dur="6.569">on my end but you sound just fine right</text>
  <text start="1764.33" dur="5.339">now I think yeah well people can look up</text>
  <text start="1768.019" dur="4.741">the definition of social contract and</text>
  <text start="1769.669" dur="5.281">and all of that as well and and I just</text>
  <text start="1772.76" dur="4.98">kind of mentioned basically a recap of a</text>
  <text start="1774.95" dur="4.62">lot of people don&amp;#39;t realize that the</text>
  <text start="1777.74" dur="4.62">government is force like Gandhi said</text>
  <text start="1779.57" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s just force and it cannot be weaned</text>
  <text start="1782.36" dur="4.83">from that it is violence itself because</text>
  <text start="1785.51" dur="4.44">the government is a concept sort of a</text>
  <text start="1787.19" dur="6.29">religion itself of violence as a</text>
  <text start="1789.95" dur="3.53">necessity for the greater good</text>
  <text start="1794.759" dur="4.811">Dustin can you hear me okay yeah can you</text>
  <text start="1798.159" dur="3">hear me I&amp;#39;m good on my end and my</text>
  <text start="1799.57" dur="6.39">signals good I think are you having some</text>
  <text start="1801.159" dur="6.571">issues yeah I&amp;#39;ve lost a few big chunks</text>
  <text start="1805.96" dur="3.48">or what you said there so hopefully it</text>
  <text start="1807.73" dur="4.019">was recorded well on your end I think so</text>
  <text start="1809.44" dur="5.16">yeah I&amp;#39;m should be good okay good so I</text>
  <text start="1811.749" dur="4.8">guess what was it one of the suggested</text>
  <text start="1814.6" dur="5.49">title that you had philosophy the tool</text>
  <text start="1816.549" dur="6.45">of our tools of our past down from our</text>
  <text start="1820.09" dur="4.159">ancestors against tyranny or something</text>
  <text start="1822.999" dur="3.571">like that yeah</text>
  <text start="1824.249" dur="4.66">okay all right well we can work on that</text>
  <text start="1826.57" dur="4.229">I I like the approach basically I think</text>
  <text start="1828.909" dur="5.25">I think we both have a clear</text>
  <text start="1830.799" dur="5.031">understanding of ways that we can apply</text>
  <text start="1834.159" dur="5.041">what I&amp;#39;m calling now my prime directive</text>
  <text start="1835.83" dur="6.49">from that I I want to live in peace with</text>
  <text start="1839.2" dur="5.549">other people and I want to prosper and I</text>
  <text start="1842.32" dur="6.209">think given that directive or that</text>
  <text start="1844.749" dur="7.41">objective that there is a moral there is</text>
  <text start="1848.529" dur="6.63">an objective moral approach to to</text>
  <text start="1852.159" dur="5.52">achieve that goal so to get this clear</text>
  <text start="1855.159" dur="7.98">you don&amp;#39;t want the government to build</text>
  <text start="1857.679" dur="6.6">the roads I don&amp;#39;t want I&amp;#39;m actually fine</text>
  <text start="1863.139" dur="3.331">with government as long as it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1864.279" dur="4.291">voluntary I&amp;#39;m fine with family as long</text>
  <text start="1866.47" dur="4.079">as loving and I&amp;#39;m fine with religion as</text>
  <text start="1868.57" dur="3.12">long as it&amp;#39;s rational well surely you</text>
  <text start="1870.549" dur="2.281">know where I&amp;#39;m going with this you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1871.69" dur="4.26">want the government to build the roads</text>
  <text start="1872.83" dur="5.789">right I would be just fine if the road</text>
  <text start="1875.95" dur="4.859">crews across the country won on strike</text>
  <text start="1878.619" dur="4.081">and walked right off I think we could</text>
  <text start="1880.809" dur="3.48">pick up the slack so do you not want</text>
  <text start="1882.7" dur="4.799">roads to get built or something like</text>
  <text start="1884.289" dur="4.321">what&amp;#39;s wrong with you my roads exactly</text>
  <text start="1887.499" dur="2.701">you see where I&amp;#39;m going with it right</text>
  <text start="1888.61" dur="4.769">like I wanted it&amp;#39;s one of those top</text>
  <text start="1890.2" dur="5.49">arguments so it&amp;#39;s funny it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="1893.379" dur="4.591">Dustin we&amp;#39;re living in a slave Society</text>
  <text start="1895.69" dur="5.219">and the fun thing about dealing with</text>
  <text start="1897.97" dur="5.01">someone like you is that we can talk</text>
  <text start="1900.909" dur="3.451">about just even basic definitions what</text>
  <text start="1902.98" dur="3.99">does it mean to be a slave what does it</text>
  <text start="1904.36" dur="4.919">mean to be free and then we can help</text>
  <text start="1906.97" dur="4.199">think through the implications of that</text>
  <text start="1909.279" dur="3.6">and that&amp;#39;s really we&amp;#39;re in such a moral</text>
  <text start="1911.169" dur="3.21">crisis and I think this is partly why</text>
  <text start="1912.879" dur="3.841">your message has been received by so</text>
  <text start="1914.379" dur="5.191">many people because the nature of the</text>
  <text start="1916.72" dur="5.399">moral crisis that were in as Iran</text>
  <text start="1919.57" dur="4.38">introduced that idea I thought she was</text>
  <text start="1922.119" dur="3.451">talking about something that had</text>
  <text start="1923.95" dur="3.39">developed over the last century or so</text>
  <text start="1925.57" dur="3.63">but</text>
  <text start="1927.34" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;ve come to realize that the moral</text>
  <text start="1929.2" dur="4.17">crisis is simply our addiction to</text>
  <text start="1931.24" dur="6.12">enslaving one another to forcing other</text>
  <text start="1933.37" dur="8">people to bend to our will and that that</text>
  <text start="1937.36" dur="7.62">creates a continual ongoing never-ending</text>
  <text start="1941.37" dur="5.559">moral crisis and and we have the the</text>
  <text start="1944.98" dur="5.1">wonderful opportunity in this age of</text>
  <text start="1946.929" dur="4.95">communication and enlightenment that we</text>
  <text start="1950.08" dur="4.11">can learn from the best people and we</text>
  <text start="1951.879" dur="5.311">can begin to demonstrate in laboratories</text>
  <text start="1954.19" dur="6.469">all over the world that we can actually</text>
  <text start="1957.19" dur="5.819">be done with enslaving one another</text>
  <text start="1960.659" dur="3.581">absolutely I mean we don&amp;#39;t need there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1963.009" dur="3.811">different groups in the world there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1964.24" dur="4.049">different political or cultural or</text>
  <text start="1966.82" dur="2.819">spiritual interests whatever there may</text>
  <text start="1968.289" dur="3.48">be they&amp;#39;re different bodies of power</text>
  <text start="1969.639" dur="3.811">they can interact with one another in</text>
  <text start="1971.769" dur="4.5">one of two ways either through force</text>
  <text start="1973.45" dur="4.41">through government or through trade with</text>
  <text start="1976.269" dur="3.301">capitalism and you know as they say</text>
  <text start="1977.86" dur="2.819">where there&amp;#39;s no trade there&amp;#39;s war and</text>
  <text start="1979.57" dur="3.299">that&amp;#39;s kind of what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1980.679" dur="4.771">government always suppresses capitalism</text>
  <text start="1982.869" dur="5.01">because it&amp;#39;s directly in competition not</text>
  <text start="1985.45" dur="3.63">because they&amp;#39;re you know anything else</text>
  <text start="1987.879" dur="2.731">that&amp;#39;s how you end up with cronyism</text>
  <text start="1989.08" dur="3.689">where certain companies have these sort</text>
  <text start="1990.61" dur="4.169">of powerful monopolies or get special</text>
  <text start="1992.769" dur="5.28">perks like you know Facebook and Google</text>
  <text start="1994.779" dur="5.85">getting all the DARPA money well Dustin</text>
  <text start="1998.049" dur="5.281">what do you think about our next</text>
  <text start="2000.629" dur="5.52">get-together what if we discuss some</text>
  <text start="2003.33" dur="5.52">definitions really started the basics I</text>
  <text start="2006.149" dur="4.951">want to propose the idea that slavery</text>
  <text start="2008.85" dur="5.189">has never gone away that we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="2011.1" dur="3.84">actually abolished slavery as as a</text>
  <text start="2014.039" dur="2.01">species</text>
  <text start="2014.94" dur="3.809">[Music]</text>
  <text start="2016.049" dur="4.38">sure spite popular sentiment would you</text>
  <text start="2018.749" dur="3.481">be interested in discussing that along</text>
  <text start="2020.429" dur="4.261">as we look to that that&amp;#39;s a great place</text>
  <text start="2022.23" dur="4.74">to start even because and when with the</text>
  <text start="2024.69" dur="4.89">definitions because really if you were</text>
  <text start="2026.97" dur="4.079">to grow your own food and then just not</text>
  <text start="2029.58" dur="3.78">talk to anybody for a couple of years</text>
  <text start="2031.049" dur="3.96">and just stay home what&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>
  <text start="2033.36" dur="5.639">if somebody&amp;#39;s gonna show up with guns</text>
  <text start="2035.009" dur="5.55">you didn&amp;#39;t pay something so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2038.999" dur="3.27">think we are free and I think the</text>
  <text start="2040.559" dur="3.6">problem you may have my baby in the</text>
  <text start="2042.269" dur="8.09">background I think the problem really is</text>
  <text start="2044.159" dur="8.611">that we are in a situation now where</text>
  <text start="2050.359" dur="3.82">people don&amp;#39;t realize that they&amp;#39;re slaves</text>
  <text start="2052.77" dur="2.73">and that&amp;#39;s worse than ever before in</text>
  <text start="2054.179" dur="3.331">history because back when people knew</text>
  <text start="2055.5" dur="3.78">they were slaves like yeah they could do</text>
  <text start="2057.51" dur="3.36">something about it eventually maybe</text>
  <text start="2059.28" dur="4.14">times weren&amp;#39;t right for it but it</text>
  <text start="2060.87" dur="4.08">initially they knew like someone&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2063.42" dur="4.08">happen that slave owners gonna turn his</text>
  <text start="2064.95" dur="5.52">back he&amp;#39;s gonna make a mistake he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2067.5" dur="4.89">gonna drop the ball get complacent but</text>
  <text start="2070.47" dur="4.23">in today&amp;#39;s world we&amp;#39;re all disposable</text>
  <text start="2072.39" dur="4.05">because they don&amp;#39;t have to buy slaves</text>
  <text start="2074.7" dur="3.33">anymore to take care of them and we all</text>
  <text start="2076.44" dur="5.19">believe that we&amp;#39;re free at least in the</text>
  <text start="2078.03" dur="4.89">Western world so you know there is some</text>
  <text start="2081.63" dur="3.84">degree of freedom we can have this</text>
  <text start="2082.92" dur="7.05">conversation because of a lot of people</text>
  <text start="2085.47" dur="6.96">dying for that in the past but I think</text>
  <text start="2089.97" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a fragile thing and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2092.43" dur="4.68">slipping pretty fast so we&amp;#39;re very close</text>
  <text start="2094.59" dur="4.5">to just outright over slavery so it</text>
  <text start="2097.11" dur="3.23">sounds like you you may have a few</text>
  <text start="2099.09" dur="4.47">thoughts on the subject</text>
  <text start="2100.34" dur="5.05">yeah I&amp;#39;ve thought about this one so</text>
  <text start="2103.56" dur="3.36">let&amp;#39;s get back together again and then</text>

  <text start="2110.73" dur="5.43">whatever because this is a sort of</text>
  <text start="2112.86" dur="5.01">obviously a niche topic and not many</text>
  <text start="2116.16" dur="3.3">people are interested in philosophy I</text>
