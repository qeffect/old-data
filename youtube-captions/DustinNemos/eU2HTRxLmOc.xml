  <text start="581.98" dur="5.13">little bit out of whack right with the</text>
  <text start="584.74" dur="4.8">crime now I don&amp;#39;t believe that people</text>
  <text start="587.11" dur="3.84">should take drugs and I do believe it</text>
  <text start="589.54" dur="3.51">does damage to people but on the other</text>
  <text start="590.95" dur="4.079">hand when you make things illegal it</text>
  <text start="593.05" dur="4.349">becomes more taboo people actually use</text>
  <text start="595.029" dur="4.231">more of it and just like in the</text>
  <text start="597.399" dur="4.56">Prohibition days it becomes stronger</text>
  <text start="599.26" dur="5.4">people quit drinking beer they started</text>
  <text start="601.959" dur="5.37">drinking hard liquor right so when you</text>
  <text start="604.66" dur="4.619">started to ban things like cocaine you</text>
  <text start="607.329" dur="6.771">ended up with concentrated street heroin</text>
  <text start="609.279" dur="7.111">and these other things right so we have</text>
  <text start="614.1" dur="3.75">all this good intention to solve the</text>
  <text start="616.39" dur="4.559">problem and we just keep making it worse</text>
  <text start="617.85" dur="5.08">so you know I can be on both sides of</text>
  <text start="620.949" dur="3.931">this because I hate the drugs I really</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="3.899">didn&amp;#39;t really hate the drugs and I want</text>
  <text start="624.88" dur="4.41">to legalize the drugs because that is in</text>
  <text start="626.829" dur="5.221">my belief the best way to eliminate</text>
  <text start="629.29" dur="5.22">their use and I think this bears out</text>
  <text start="632.05" dur="4.19">with this it doesn&amp;#39;t seem it maybe it</text>
  <text start="634.51" dur="4.56">doesn&amp;#39;t seem like necessarily like</text>
  <text start="636.24" dur="4.779">common sense logic at first but it</text>
  <text start="639.07" dur="5.25">actually does bear out on all of the</text>
  <text start="641.019" dur="4.411">logic down the road and and that seems</text>
  <text start="644.32" dur="2.87">to be the case everywhere they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="645.43" dur="5.94">legalized that the use goes down</text>
  <text start="647.19" dur="5.98">everywhere and oftentimes governments</text>
  <text start="651.37" dur="3.149">will pair this with like offers like if</text>
  <text start="653.17" dur="3.72">you if you get caught using it look</text>
  <text start="654.519" dur="3.901">we&amp;#39;ll offer you some help right and</text>
  <text start="656.89" dur="2.93">their safe places to use it that kind of</text>
  <text start="658.42" dur="4.82">thing but</text>
  <text start="659.82" dur="5.519">as that happens it becomes less and less</text>
  <text start="663.24" dur="3.839">and and kids start using less of it</text>
  <text start="665.339" dur="4.351">because then it&amp;#39;s not as exciting it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="667.079" dur="4.411">not you know forbidden anymore yeah you</text>
  <text start="669.69" dur="3.57">know children and forbidden things they</text>
  <text start="671.49" dur="4.14">just want to do it more than this taboo</text>
  <text start="673.26" dur="4.98">is exciting that&amp;#39;s why they drink right</text>
  <text start="675.63" dur="4.5">I stopped drinking when I turned 21</text>
  <text start="678.24" dur="5.37">because it was stupid and I was over it</text>
  <text start="680.13" dur="6.87">but you know as a young kid I I was wild</text>
  <text start="683.61" dur="6.479">and I was out of control and just live</text>

  <text start="703.92" dur="3.99">the drug use and then things like</text>
  <text start="705.51" dur="4.079">alcohol tend to be more of a gateway</text>
  <text start="707.91" dur="3.72">drug than things like marijuana which is</text>
  <text start="709.589" dur="3.421">a common misconception ivy I didn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="917.36" dur="7.02">probably not it and then also I think</text>
  <text start="920.709" dur="6.671">the Japanese Prime Minister Abe was also</text>
  <text start="924.38" dur="4.5">in Iran at the time so that wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="928.88" dur="4.319">and I could be wrong about that but I</text>
  <text start="930.47" dur="4.32">think that&amp;#39;s the case now doing some</text>
  <text start="933.199" dur="3.241">sort of you know political visit which</text>
  <text start="934.79" dur="5.13">would be a terrible time to start a</text>

  <text start="956.18" dur="4.05">Hong Kong is its own nation and really</text>
  <text start="958.64" dur="3.21">what&amp;#39;s happened is that since Britain</text>

  <text start="961.85" dur="3.989">losing ground on that that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="964.22" dur="3.33">were sort of the capitalist center of</text>
  <text start="965.839" dur="3.721">China they were the most prosperous that</text>
  <text start="967.55" dur="4.56">that was the middle class of China but</text>
  <text start="969.56" dur="4.29">China is moving in and the first step is</text>
  <text start="972.11" dur="4.169">to be able to extradite citizens of Hong</text>
  <text start="973.85" dur="3.81">Kong to China where they can be tortured</text>
  <text start="976.279" dur="3.361">killed and all the other things just</text>
  <text start="977.66" dur="6.929">like all the other Chinese citizens or</text>
  <text start="979.64" dur="9.3">slaves now imprecision ping Li clearly</text>
  <text start="984.589" dur="6.81">behind this but the local the local</text>

  <text start="991.399" dur="6">not to be trusted and the locals do not</text>
  <text start="995.029" dur="6.301">trust her in fact these protests are far</text>
  <text start="997.399" dur="6.961">worse than was reported I&amp;#39;m actually</text>
  <text start="1001.33" dur="6.24">getting reports of great violence and in</text>
  <text start="1004.36" dur="6.06">hundreds in hospitals including police</text>
  <text start="1007.57" dur="4.019">and many students because clearly you</text>
  <text start="1010.42" dur="3">know the students would be the first one</text>
  <text start="1011.589" dur="3.361">to lose their temper and fight back and</text>
  <text start="1013.42" dur="3.84">things like that and then they&amp;#39;d be the</text>
  <text start="1014.95" dur="4.62">first ones to to protest and get hurt in</text>
  <text start="1017.26" dur="5.28">any way so it&amp;#39;s probably mostly students</text>
  <text start="1019.57" dur="5.55">out there and this is this is where we</text>

  <text start="1027.37" dur="3.959">acting like it was less of a problem</text>
  <text start="1029.17" dur="3.96">than it really was but you know we have</text>

  <text start="1653.6" dur="4.35">momentum behind them but most of these</text>
  <text start="1655.7" dur="3.57">companies fail to get momentum we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1657.95" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re trying to do a little bit</text>
  <text start="1659.27" dur="4.14">differently in our approach because we</text>
  <text start="1661.37" dur="3.89">working with the influencers we already</text>
  <text start="1663.41" dur="4.5">have the momentum now we just need the</text>
