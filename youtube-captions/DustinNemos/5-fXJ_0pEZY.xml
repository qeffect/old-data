  <text start="28.83" dur="3.42">can buy just a basic white hat from</text>
  <text start="30.779" dur="5.041">Walmart for like four dollars or</text>
  <text start="32.25" dur="5.64">something it&amp;#39;s not expensive but just</text>
  <text start="35.82" dur="5.579">lengthen Magga hat just like the Red Hat</text>

  <text start="60.739" dur="3.64">we definitely interested in suggestions</text>
  <text start="63" dur="6.299">and such because I&amp;#39;m not really the</text>
  <text start="64.379" dur="7.201">artistic creative type that said join</text>
  <text start="69.299" dur="4.651">the white hats movement and this kind of</text>
  <text start="71.58" dur="3.859">played into my idea because some of you</text>
  <text start="73.95" dur="3.75">may know I ordered these little like</text>
  <text start="75.439" dur="4.091">badges which are really cool and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="77.7" dur="3.33">gonna I&amp;#39;m gonna show them when they get</text>
  <text start="79.53" dur="3.629">well when I get home I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="81.03" dur="4.53">waiting on me and they&amp;#39;re gonna be you</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="4.411">know just a cue badge or different</text>
  <text start="85.56" dur="3.51">designs you could do you could custom</text>
  <text start="87.57" dur="2.85">order your own badge this doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="89.07" dur="3.17">to be something you purchase from me</text>
  <text start="90.42" dur="5.28">this is this is kind of a support</text>
  <text start="92.24" dur="5.019">support queue thing and it doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="4.02">to be branded and doesn&amp;#39;t have to be a</text>
  <text start="97.259" dur="4.531">Dustin Nemo&amp;#39;s thing it has to be a queue</text>
  <text start="99.72" dur="4.649">thing and that&amp;#39;s kind of the goal that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="101.79" dur="4.469">why I like the the blank white hat maybe</text>
  <text start="104.369" dur="3.201">you could just magic marker queue on</text>
  <text start="106.259" dur="3.661">there that&amp;#39;s what some people are doing</text>
  <text start="107.57" dur="5.92">you could use the hashtags you know</text>
  <text start="109.92" dur="6.299">white hat move winter or white hats and</text>
  <text start="113.49" dur="4.409">you know you could get your upgrade your</text>
  <text start="116.219" dur="3.451">cue badge which I&amp;#39;m just doing the one</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="3.18">that I like in terms of art cuz they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="119.67" dur="3.78">kind of expensive at first to buy a</text>
  <text start="121.079" dur="4.86">bunch but I&amp;#39;m gonna sell these things</text>
  <text start="123.45" dur="3.87">like just above cost and just to get the</text>
  <text start="125.939" dur="5.221">word out there and get like a movement</text>
  <text start="127.32" dur="6.12">started so that&amp;#39;s kind of my idea I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="4.62">limited because I&amp;#39;m selling them</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="4.5">so I can&amp;#39;t do like copyrighted images or</text>
  <text start="135.78" dur="7.14">anything like that I can I can only do a</text>
  <text start="137.94" dur="7.2">few images online but you guys could</text>
  <text start="142.92" dur="6.03">find any image that you want so that</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="6.3">said I will probably stick to the more</text>
  <text start="148.95" dur="5.1">basic designs like the letters and stuff</text>
  <text start="151.44" dur="5.04">and if we can get an artist or something</text>
  <text start="154.05" dur="4.23">that wants to help or I could hire an</text>
  <text start="156.48" dur="4.53">artist I think there&amp;#39;s websites for that</text>
  <text start="158.28" dur="7.11">just let me know what you guys want now</text>

  <text start="165.39" dur="3.63">on midterms there&amp;#39;s all of the big</text>
  <text start="167.58" dur="5.16">tacker moving toward the censorship</text>
  <text start="169.02" dur="6.36">clamp down and I imagine if I were on</text>
  <text start="172.74" dur="5.34">their team that I would want to time it</text>
  <text start="175.38" dur="5.61">so that I can do the most damage with a</text>
  <text start="178.08" dur="6.66">crackdown censorship when could you do</text>
