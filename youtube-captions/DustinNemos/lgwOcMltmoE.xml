  <text start="63.579" dur="5.461">Zuckerberg issue so as short as I can</text>
  <text start="66.85" dur="4.2">ben shapiro made a really good point</text>
  <text start="69.04" dur="5.64">about something that zuckerberg said</text>
  <text start="71.05" dur="5.04">during these congressional questioning</text>
  <text start="74.68" dur="4.17">that he&amp;#39;s going through i mean it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="76.09" dur="4.8">exactly anything more than that because</text>
  <text start="78.85" dur="4.05">he&amp;#39;s not under oath they&amp;#39;re all bribed</text>
  <text start="80.89" dur="4.02">85% of them got money from him it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="82.9" dur="5.52">corrupt through and through it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="84.91" dur="5.04">just bread and circuses for making us</text>
  <text start="88.42" dur="3.33">feel like we did something you know</text>
  <text start="89.95" dur="3.63">there&amp;#39;s a few people that got in a few</text>
  <text start="91.75" dur="4.77">decent questions but he you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="93.58" dur="4.23">not under oath and he slipped up he</text>
  <text start="96.52" dur="3.24">basically said that he considers</text>
  <text start="97.81" dur="4.29">facebook responsible for the content</text>
  <text start="99.76" dur="4.89">published on the site now the way the</text>
  <text start="102.1" dur="5.49">law works right now publishers are</text>
  <text start="104.65" dur="4.56">guilty of oil they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="107.59" dur="5.22">responsible and they can be found guilty</text>
  <text start="109.21" dur="6.12">for putting things up that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="112.81" dur="5.43">have permission or or things that maybe</text>
  <text start="115.33" dur="5.55">are illegal like child sex trafficking</text>
  <text start="118.24" dur="7.61">or illegal images or you know things</text>
  <text start="120.88" dur="6.99">like that so Facebook and other hosts</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="4.689">without going through the complicated</text>
  <text start="127.87" dur="6.479">part the hosts are not responsible for</text>
  <text start="130.539" dur="5.791">what you put on their their platform so</text>
  <text start="134.349" dur="4.17">by saying that he feels Facebook is</text>
  <text start="136.33" dur="4.61">responsible for the content published on</text>
  <text start="138.519" dur="2.421">the site</text>
  <text start="141.28" dur="4.49">he&amp;#39;s basically kind of opening himself</text>
  <text start="143.26" dur="5.339">up to lawsuits and liability possibly</text>
  <text start="145.77" dur="5.59">trillions of dollars of liability an</text>
  <text start="148.599" dur="6.061">example would be Ben Shapiro also put</text>

  <text start="339" dur="5.29">demanded loyalty like a mafia boss so</text>
  <text start="342.55" dur="3.63">he&amp;#39;s going right with that same old</text>
  <text start="344.29" dur="3.81">narrative that he tried the first time</text>

  <text start="348.1" dur="5.22">asked him for loyalty like some kind of</text>
  <text start="351.28" dur="5.07">dawn and then later admitted that it</text>
  <text start="353.32" dur="4.8">wasn&amp;#39;t true so this this book is just</text>
  <text start="356.35" dur="3.42">written to play right into the the</text>
  <text start="358.12" dur="3.39">leftist narrative of everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="359.77" dur="3.45">happened if you go over to that side of</text>
  <text start="361.51" dur="3.03">things they have all of the evidence in</text>
  <text start="363.22" dur="2.91">the world that Trump has done everything</text>
  <text start="364.54" dur="2.91">wrong and none of it actually pans out</text>
  <text start="366.13" dur="3.98">when you bother to look past the</text>
  <text start="367.45" dur="5.64">headlines and the first two paragraphs</text>

  <text start="379.36" dur="5.19">point in my view good Lord is that</text>
  <text start="382.09" dur="4.95">anyway I made the point in my view that</text>
  <text start="384.55" dur="6">this is just another North Korea Trump</text>
  <text start="387.04" dur="4.92">is play Trump is playing the narrative</text>
  <text start="390.55" dur="5.39">he&amp;#39;s controlling the narrative he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="391.96" dur="6.51">wagging the media the dog so to speak I</text>
  <text start="395.94" dur="3.91">don&amp;#39;t think that they&amp;#39;re real really</text>
  <text start="398.47" dur="4.02">actually gonna go into World War three</text>
  <text start="399.85" dur="4.59">over this especially with the north not</text>
  <text start="402.49" dur="4.77">North Korea but with nuclear superpower</text>
  <text start="404.44" dur="3.87">Russia it&amp;#39;s not gonna happen and Trump</text>
  <text start="407.26" dur="3.81">knows better than this</text>
  <text start="408.31" dur="5.22">who knows better than this the whole</text>
  <text start="411.07" dur="4.59">Syrian proxy war thing is coming to an</text>
  <text start="413.53" dur="4.38">end Trump wants to pull us out then they</text>
  <text start="415.66" dur="4.38">something convenient like this happens</text>
  <text start="417.91" dur="5.13">that that keeps us in there</text>
  <text start="420.04" dur="4.56">Trump&amp;#39;s not gonna fall for it okay Hugh</text>
  <text start="423.04" dur="2.28">even tells us later on in the video I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="424.6" dur="4.89">gonna show you this</text>
  <text start="425.32" dur="6.3">he tells us basically that this Syria</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="3.77">issue was a delay in what key was doing</text>
  <text start="431.62" dur="4.65">behind the scenes of a couple days</text>
  <text start="433.26" dur="5.83">because of this this blow over of a</text>
  <text start="436.27" dur="4.29">media onslaught and in distraction from</text>
  <text start="439.09" dur="3.72">the narrative that we&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="440.56" dur="4.23">and then cue and Trump asked us to mean</text>
  <text start="442.81" dur="4.26">he wants us to get out there and go on</text>
  <text start="444.79" dur="4.38">meme offensive so we&amp;#39;re gonna retake the</text>
  <text start="447.07" dur="4.5">narrative but this has been a big hiccup</text>
  <text start="449.17" dur="3.18">a big distraction a big delay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.57" dur="3.75">really all it is</text>
  <text start="452.35" dur="4.14">and I don&amp;#39;t think nothing I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="455.32" dur="2.7">everything that I&amp;#39;ve seen actually makes</text>
  <text start="456.49" dur="2.82">me more and more certain that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="2.88">what&amp;#39;s going on here I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="459.31" dur="3.36">there&amp;#39;s any reason to think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.9" dur="4.53">actually going to World War 3 but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.67" dur="5.07">follow the narrative let&amp;#39;s follow some</text>
  <text start="465.43" dur="5.46">of the information that that suggests</text>
  <text start="467.74" dur="4.71">that you know we might be the</text>
  <text start="470.89" dur="4.55">government&amp;#39;s themselves believe we might</text>
  <text start="472.45" dur="5.79">be obviously because there&amp;#39;s government</text>
  <text start="475.44" dur="6.04">military their ships leaving the port in</text>
  <text start="478.24" dur="5.43">Syria of Russian origin there&amp;#39;s the US</text>
  <text start="481.48" dur="5.58">fleet out there so they&amp;#39;re somewhere</text>
  <text start="483.67" dur="5.97">near each other I&amp;#39;m not sure the the the</text>
  <text start="487.06" dur="4.52">flights have been cleared all over Syria</text>
  <text start="489.64" dur="4.77">you can see it with the flight tracking</text>
  <text start="491.58" dur="4.87">websites there&amp;#39;s no planes over there at</text>
  <text start="494.41" dur="4.98">all so it&amp;#39;s ready as though we were</text>
  <text start="496.45" dur="5.97">going to strike but then Trump come out</text>
  <text start="499.39" dur="5.96">and said something to the extent of I</text>
  <text start="502.42" dur="5.66">never said when I&amp;#39;m going to strike so</text>
  <text start="505.35" dur="6.07">basically he&amp;#39;s kind of backing down on</text>
  <text start="508.08" dur="6.82">Russia&amp;#39;s threatened war over this I mean</text>
  <text start="511.42" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re not backing down and it just</text>
  <text start="514.9" dur="4.56">seems to be narrative it just seems to</text>
  <text start="517.81" dur="3">be this push because every bad guy every</text>
  <text start="519.46" dur="3.75">deep state are you including Hillary</text>
  <text start="520.81" dur="5.04">Clinton now comes out and says we should</text>
  <text start="523.21" dur="6.12">bomb Syria half the European leaders are</text>
  <text start="525.85" dur="5.7">saying we should bomb Syria all of that</text>
  <text start="529.33" dur="4.11">with no evidence all of the other things</text>
  <text start="531.55" dur="3.51">I mentioned like Isis having done more</text>
  <text start="533.44" dur="3.66">than fifty two chemical attacks that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="535.06" dur="4.24">two years ago the same group that</text>
  <text start="537.1" dur="4.82">accused Assad of</text>
  <text start="539.3" dur="5.11">these chemical weapons used among the</text>
  <text start="541.92" dur="4.62">Kurds two years ago and was caught on</text>
  <text start="544.41" dur="4.83">camera</text>
  <text start="546.54" dur="4.919">dragging dead children&amp;#39;s bodies into</text>
  <text start="549.24" dur="3.959">positions to make it look more more</text>
  <text start="551.459" dur="3.75">sympathetic for Western audiences you</text>
  <text start="553.199" dur="4.2">know like like the the picture where the</text>
  <text start="555.209" dur="4.82">kid the little girl had her arm over the</text>
  <text start="557.399" dur="4.951">little boys assuming maybe her brother</text>
  <text start="560.029" dur="4.78">like they died holding each other in</text>
  <text start="562.35" dur="4.049">horror and agony these are the kind of</text>
  <text start="564.809" dur="3.421">things that they do to manipulate us to</text>
  <text start="566.399" dur="3.42">stage these things not saying that</text>
  <text start="568.23" dur="4.589">deaths weren&amp;#39;t real in some pasts</text>
  <text start="569.819" dur="5.401">attacks maybe even this one but when</text>
  <text start="572.819" dur="5.7">they die and then they drag them</text>
  <text start="575.22" dur="5.82">together to make it manipulate you on an</text>
  <text start="578.519" dur="4.351">emotional level that&amp;#39;s worth that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="581.04" dur="7.469">worth noting ok so there&amp;#39;s all of this</text>
  <text start="582.87" dur="7.709">push to try to get the the war going</text>
  <text start="588.509" dur="5.76">ok the war machine is just full force</text>
  <text start="590.579" dur="6.151">trying to push for this and what can I</text>
  <text start="594.269" dur="3.75">say I mean it that&amp;#39;s the same stuff</text>
  <text start="596.73" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;ve always done it&amp;#39;s just not gonna</text>
  <text start="598.019" dur="3.331">work because we have our guy in now and</text>
  <text start="599.67" dur="3.839">he has the veto power of whatever the</text>
