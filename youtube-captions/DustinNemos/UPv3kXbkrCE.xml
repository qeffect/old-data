  <text start="103.5" dur="3.36">over all of the drama basically just</text>
  <text start="105.42" dur="3.51">doing what&amp;#39;s best for our countries</text>
  <text start="106.86" dur="4.799">making win-win cooperative deals you</text>
  <text start="108.93" dur="5.399">know that&amp;#39;s what they don&amp;#39;t want because</text>
  <text start="111.659" dur="4.381">that leads to peace you know when when</text>
  <text start="114.329" dur="7.801">goods don&amp;#39;t cross borders troops do as</text>
  <text start="116.04" dur="8.16">the old phrase so USA are I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="122.13" dur="4.589">Reuters article calm they they actually</text>
  <text start="124.2" dur="5.13">come out and started to talk about Trump</text>
  <text start="126.719" dur="4.161">actually kind of defending Tommy</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="3.98">Robinson</text>
  <text start="130.88" dur="5.25">through the ambassador to the UK so this</text>
  <text start="133.31" dur="5.67">is kind of like hey why is why is Tommy</text>
  <text start="136.13" dur="4.74">in prison this is wrong very interesting</text>
  <text start="138.98" dur="4.05">and I love to see that Trump is gonna</text>
  <text start="140.87" dur="3.96">actually come out and and stand up for</text>
  <text start="143.03" dur="3.84">Tommy because it brings a lot of</text>
  <text start="144.83" dur="3.24">attention to what&amp;#39;s going on there it</text>
  <text start="146.87" dur="3.839">brings a lot of attention back to</text>
  <text start="148.07" dur="4.38">obviously the route thing behind what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="150.709" dur="4.411">going on there which is the cultural</text>
  <text start="152.45" dur="4.38">invasion of fundamentalist Islam and the</text>
  <text start="155.12" dur="4.05">incompatible cultures and the child</text>
  <text start="156.83" dur="4.23">grooming gangs and the rape gangs and</text>
  <text start="159.17" dur="5.37">everything else that Tommy is covering</text>
  <text start="161.06" dur="6.3">this stuff you know that this is a great</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="4.949">issue and and also on this trip Trump</text>
  <text start="167.36" dur="4.92">has said quote I think you were losing</text>
  <text start="169.489" dur="4.591">your culture look around I mean he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.28" dur="4.38">warning he&amp;#39;s warning the Brits as well</text>
  <text start="174.08" dur="4.11">and I think this is awesome some people</text>
  <text start="176.66" dur="3.54">made a big fuss about him not bowing to</text>
  <text start="178.19" dur="4.019">the Queen but let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s be frank here</text>
  <text start="180.2" dur="4.23">Americans shouldn&amp;#39;t ballot royalty it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.209" dur="4.591">it&amp;#39;s kind of dishonours the people who</text>
  <text start="184.43" dur="3.75">died so that we wouldn&amp;#39;t have to and if</text>
  <text start="186.8" dur="3.48">you really think about it and you go</text>
  <text start="188.18" dur="3.42">back through history I mean yes they</text>
  <text start="190.28" dur="3.66">have all the pretty jewelry in the nice</text>
  <text start="191.6" dur="4.8">mansions but royalty really just means</text>
  <text start="193.94" dur="6.329">like they have a family hobby of mass</text>
  <text start="196.4" dur="5.58">murder so yeah I know it&amp;#39;s a funny way</text>
  <text start="200.269" dur="4.051">of putting it but it&amp;#39;s true absolutely</text>
  <text start="201.98" dur="4.11">if you go back through these Royals as</text>
  <text start="204.32" dur="2.699">they say if you kill a man you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="206.09" dur="5.25">murderer</text>
  <text start="207.019" dur="5.431">if you kill 100 but you&amp;#39;re so I guess I</text>
  <text start="211.34" dur="2.61">don&amp;#39;t know how got a serial killer or</text>
  <text start="212.45" dur="3.03">something if you kill a thousand you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="213.95" dur="4.2">a king and if you kill them all you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="215.48" dur="4.59">god well that tells you a lot about</text>
  <text start="218.15" dur="5.1">what&amp;#39;s going on in the world today folks</text>
  <text start="220.07" dur="5.22">because they&amp;#39;re trying to kill not quiet</text>
  <text start="223.25" dur="3.36">all but quite a few you know they want</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="3.479">some servants left around but they think</text>
  <text start="226.61" dur="5.849">that they&amp;#39;re gods with their</text>
  <text start="228.769" dur="6.591">depopulation agenda before meeting like</text>
  <text start="232.459" dur="5.221">I said with the Queen</text>
  <text start="235.36" dur="3.76">you know that must have been very</text>
  <text start="237.68" dur="3.869">unpleasant for Trump to begin with</text>
  <text start="239.12" dur="3.869">because he probably absolutely knows the</text>
  <text start="241.549" dur="3.121">kind of crap that she&amp;#39;s up to I mean her</text>
  <text start="242.989" dur="3.331">mother and probably her as well had</text>
  <text start="244.67" dur="3.14">whole body blood transfusions with</text>
  <text start="246.32" dur="5.37">children I mean it&amp;#39;s disgusting</text>
  <text start="247.81" dur="5.709">monthly anyway Trump actually sat in</text>
  <text start="251.69" dur="3.389">Winston Churchill&amp;#39;s chair so for those</text>
  <text start="253.519" dur="3.631">of you who are history buffs this is</text>
  <text start="255.079" dur="3.991">kind of a one of those moments you might</text>
  <text start="257.15" dur="4.45">want to print that one out put it on</text>
  <text start="259.07" dur="5.29">your wall or in your photo album</text>
  <text start="261.6" dur="4.47">or whatever who knows they&amp;#39;ll probably</text>
  <text start="264.36" dur="4.5">try to scrub that one from the internet</text>
  <text start="266.07" dur="4.29">rod Rosenstein impeachment plans are</text>
  <text start="268.86" dur="3.9">actually drawing this could happen as</text>
  <text start="270.36" dur="4.77">early as Monday I&amp;#39;m being told so this</text>
  <text start="272.76" dur="4.95">is I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll happen but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="275.13" dur="3.27">sure will actually kick the ball down</text>
  <text start="277.71" dur="2.55">the hill</text>
  <text start="278.4" dur="6.21">down the road a little bit but it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="280.26" dur="6.99">start the ball rolling at least know</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="3.9">those two those two expressions I guess</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t usually go together but they make</text>
  <text start="288.51" dur="5.19">sense together as a slow progress which</text>
  <text start="292.38" dur="3.03">is all we&amp;#39;ve had the whole time I think</text>
  <text start="293.7" dur="3.45">I think the excitement is really gonna</text>
  <text start="295.41" dur="3.9">be midterms because both sides are</text>
  <text start="297.15" dur="4.14">poised there they&amp;#39;ve got their plans and</text>
  <text start="299.31" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re ready but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="301.29" dur="2.97">waiting for the right timing to do the</text>
  <text start="302.64" dur="6.3">most damage for the for the general</text>
  <text start="304.26" dur="7.98">voting in the midterms and Republicans</text>
  <text start="308.94" dur="5.43">are actually praising Lisa page after</text>
  <text start="312.24" dur="3.72">she no showed and then showed up to a</text>
  <text start="314.37" dur="4.14">closed-door testimony and they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="315.96" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re even going so far in one cases</text>
  <text start="318.51" dur="6.06">to say that the the the rumors that she</text>
  <text start="321.57" dur="4.47">was not cooperating or were misplaced or</text>
  <text start="324.57" dur="2.73">were actually spread maliciously or</text>
  <text start="326.04" dur="3.93">whatever I think they&amp;#39;re saying I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="4.92">ever the exact quote but basically she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="329.97" dur="4.38">cooperating like fully like completely</text>
  <text start="332.22" dur="3.72">like completely and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="334.35" dur="3.71">she&amp;#39;s given them more stuff on top of</text>
  <text start="335.94" dur="5.79">what rock did not give them so</text>
  <text start="338.06" dur="6.67">interesting let&amp;#39;s hope she doesn&amp;#39;t meet</text>
  <text start="341.73" dur="4.86">with a red tie or scarf or whatever red</text>
  <text start="344.73" dur="5.13">things that they want to tie around</text>
  <text start="346.59" dur="5.79">doorknobs at her place we know how this</text>
  <text start="349.86" dur="5.9">stuff goes right I just look at all the</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="6.03">deaths in what&amp;#39;s happening lately with</text>
  <text start="355.76" dur="4.81">not just the Kate Spade situation in</text>
  <text start="358.41" dur="4.53">that really weird situation where her</text>
  <text start="360.57" dur="4.05">husband came out wearing a Mickey Mouse</text>
  <text start="362.94" dur="4.35">looking mask like they&amp;#39;re not quite</text>
  <text start="364.62" dur="3.78">Nicki but a mouse mask the next day like</text>
  <text start="367.29" dur="2.97">not something you have sitting around</text>
  <text start="368.4" dur="5.13">your apartment all the time</text>
  <text start="370.26" dur="6.09">that means rat and she died with a red</text>
  <text start="373.53" dur="4.83">scarf and a doorknob which is not a way</text>
  <text start="376.35" dur="3.66">that you know let&amp;#39;s to be fair typically</text>
  <text start="378.36" dur="3.57">statistically at least women would not</text>
  <text start="380.01" dur="5.28">hang themselves generally speaking they</text>
  <text start="381.93" dur="4.68">would use a poison so or a hot knife and</text>
  <text start="385.29" dur="5.119">then slit wrists that kind of thing</text>
  <text start="386.61" dur="7.47">because you know it takes a lot of</text>
  <text start="390.409" dur="6.19">suffering to hang yourself and and that</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="4.38">is not it&amp;#39;s not the style of a woman I</text>
  <text start="396.599" dur="3.391">wouldn&amp;#39;t want to die that way either I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="398.46" dur="5.549">not trying to be sexist or anything I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="399.99" dur="5.31">just saying statistically whereas men</text>
  <text start="404.009" dur="5.551">tend to be a little more like guns and</text>
  <text start="405.3" dur="6.57">hangings I think you know yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.56" dur="4.859">that&amp;#39;s still that&amp;#39;s in our recent</text>
  <text start="411.87" dur="5.46">history so she&amp;#39;s hung with a red scarf</text>
  <text start="414.419" dur="4.981">around her doorknob she&amp;#39;s got some</text>
  <text start="417.33" dur="5.67">connections to what&amp;#39;s going on and then</text>
  <text start="419.4" dur="6.859">husband comes out with a mouse mask you</text>
  <text start="423" dur="5.46">know this is definitely not just</text>
  <text start="426.259" dur="4.69">coincidences folks especially when you</text>
  <text start="428.46" dur="4.5">consider the FBI agents multiple FBI</text>
  <text start="430.949" dur="4.891">agents two of them that died before on</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="3.959">the same case in separate dates died the</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="4.02">day before they were supposed to testify</text>
  <text start="436.919" dur="4.351">against the Clintons and and then now</text>
  <text start="439.86" dur="3.299">more recently there was an explosion in</text>
  <text start="441.27" dur="3.54">New Jersey where a whole house was taken</text>
  <text start="443.159" dur="2.76">out a woman and her husband and I I</text>
  <text start="444.81" dur="2.969">don&amp;#39;t know if there were any children</text>

  <text start="461.879" dur="3.63">connections you know I can only remember</text>
  <text start="463.68" dur="3.539">a few at a time you have to go and look</text>
  <text start="465.509" dur="4.321">at them out if you look at the map these</text>
  <text start="467.219" dur="4.711">connections are it&amp;#39;s like watching the</text>
  <text start="469.83" dur="4.199">3d image of a brain with all the neuron</text>
  <text start="471.93" dur="4.109">connections that&amp;#39;s the map now guys we</text>
  <text start="474.029" dur="3.48">have all of the corruption laid out we</text>
  <text start="476.039" dur="3.6">have more than probable cause to</text>
  <text start="477.509" dur="4.41">investigate these people okay</text>
  <text start="479.639" dur="4.291">it&amp;#39;s not our job as journalists</text>
  <text start="481.919" dur="4.59">necessarily to gather the incriminating</text>
  <text start="483.93" dur="6.69">details to prosecute all right is our</text>

  <text start="847.229" dur="4.41">right thing no matter who had hurt that</text>
  <text start="849.809" dur="3.33">was his personality type right like he</text>
  <text start="851.639" dur="3.57">wasn&amp;#39;t actually evil or bad or anything</text>
  <text start="853.139" dur="4.77">else he was actually like kind and</text>

  <text start="886.619" dur="3.75">out to be basically an antihero</text>
  <text start="888.479" dur="4.92">like he was the good guy who did the</text>
  <text start="890.369" dur="5.07">right thing the hard thing and killed</text>
  <text start="893.399" dur="6.81">half the universe and he succeeded I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="895.439" dur="6.39">sorry - spoiler alert I&amp;#39;m sorry - maybe</text>
  <text start="900.209" dur="3.72">I should ask for a ruler in the in the</text>

  <text start="1000.579" dur="4.7">oceans are the source of life on the</text>
  <text start="1002.199" dur="5.551">planet so we have to take care of them</text>

  <text start="1007.75" dur="3.57">if you&amp;#39;re looking at the east coast of</text>
  <text start="1008.89" dur="4.23">the US just from the the runoff of some</text>

  <text start="1014.529" dur="4.141">water and I imagine that the fishing on</text>
  <text start="1017.199" dur="2.851">the East Coast socks now because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1018.67" dur="2.49">pretty much the whole East Coast you</text>
  <text start="1020.05" dur="5.34">probably have to go out to sea to do</text>
  <text start="1021.16" dur="6.12">fishing very well maybe right up on the</text>
  <text start="1025.39" dur="5.22">shore it&amp;#39;s not quite as bad because the</text>
  <text start="1027.28" dur="5.37">way the the water works it kind of sets</text>
  <text start="1030.61" dur="4.199">it in these dead zones right outside the</text>

  <text start="1042.48" dur="4">it&amp;#39;s terrifying I don&amp;#39;t know what our</text>

  <text start="1049.63" dur="4.28">I think we&amp;#39;ll be able to figure out ways</text>
  <text start="1051.16" dur="6.24">around that but it&amp;#39;s scary very scary</text>
