  <text start="3.33" dur="4.95">most of destiny most calm it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="6.12" dur="4.559">time for a haircut I know I know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="8.28" dur="5.25">getting to it I&amp;#39;ve been very busy now I</text>
  <text start="10.679" dur="4.531">wanted to make just a real quick point</text>
  <text start="13.53" dur="2.7">it was just kind of floating around my</text>
  <text start="15.21" dur="3.989">head I don&amp;#39;t even really know how to</text>
  <text start="16.23" dur="4.889">phrase it but there is a lot of division</text>
  <text start="19.199" dur="3.42">okay I&amp;#39;m gonna throw up a really cool</text>
  <text start="21.119" dur="3.781">thumbnail for this video that sort of</text>
  <text start="22.619" dur="4.051">makes the point for me there is a lot of</text>
  <text start="24.9" dur="3.539">division and there are a lot of people</text>
  <text start="26.67" dur="4.8">creating disunity in the America</text>
  <text start="28.439" dur="4.861">movement however I think that that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="31.47" dur="3.66">people who are not Shadow Man the people</text>
  <text start="33.3" dur="4.259">that are spreading lies the people that</text>
  <text start="35.13" dur="5.179">are trying to run you into the rocks</text>
  <text start="37.559" dur="5.43">rather than be the lighthouse so I</text>
  <text start="40.309" dur="5.291">wanted to just throw this out there and</text>
  <text start="42.989" dur="4.41">then let people consider what if I have</text>
  <text start="45.6" dur="4.65">people that are actually creating the</text>
  <text start="47.399" dur="5.73">disunity in the movement are those folks</text>
  <text start="50.25" dur="4.739">now why do I think this well their big</text>
  <text start="53.129" dur="3.331">argument seems to be you know I&amp;#39;ve and</text>
  <text start="54.989" dur="4.561">I&amp;#39;ve got quite a few of them you know</text>
  <text start="56.46" dur="4.71">yelling it at me all day long that we in</text>
  <text start="59.55" dur="4.41">the Q movement are making the magnet</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="4.26">movement look crazy well that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="63.96" dur="5.28">case because that would imply that</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="6.33">people actually trust the MSM in their</text>
  <text start="69.24" dur="5.82">hundreds a week of articles against Q</text>
  <text start="71.76" dur="5.039">and on no one trusts the MSM except the</text>
  <text start="75.06" dur="3.48">crazy left people that the small</text>
  <text start="76.799" dur="4.261">minority of the people on the left that</text>
  <text start="78.54" dur="4.23">are still you know trusting them are the</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="3.09">crazy left I don&amp;#39;t mean all the left I</text>
  <text start="82.77" dur="5.279">mean there&amp;#39;s obviously a hashtag walk</text>
  <text start="84.15" dur="5.73">away things like that so it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="88.049" dur="4.14">really I don&amp;#39;t know it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to</text>
  <text start="89.88" dur="4.59">make a lot of sense to me we have all of</text>
  <text start="92.189" dur="5.011">the actual evidence it makes the most</text>
  <text start="94.47" dur="4.53">sense to follow the Q narrative we have</text>
  <text start="97.2" dur="5.79">a hundred something different proofs at</text>
  <text start="99" dur="5.88">this point evidence is and everyone who</text>
  <text start="102.99" dur="3.989">is you know against it just keeps</text>
  <text start="104.88" dur="4.739">backing down from from debates or</text>
  <text start="106.979" dur="5.551">spreading lies or blocking people for</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="3.78">you know disagreeing with them or or</text>
  <text start="112.53" dur="2.61">what-have-you</text>
  <text start="113.399" dur="3.15">you know I only block people when</text>
  <text start="115.14" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re spamming or being like</text>
  <text start="116.549" dur="3.091">incredibly rude and in fact I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="118.32" dur="2.61">actually stopped banning most of the</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="3.57">people that are being incredibly rude</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="5.369">just so that you can see how they act</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="4.65">now I approach this thing I know not</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="3.63">everyone in the Q movement does I</text>
  <text start="127.86" dur="4.05">encourage you to always be polite and</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="6.631">remember that you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="131.91" dur="6.75">you&amp;#39;re a diplomat for the Q movement and</text>
  <text start="136.56" dur="3.81">always be polite because you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="138.66" dur="4.46">push a lot of people away being a bully</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="4.68">even if you&amp;#39;re in the right and even if</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="6.85">they deserve it</text>
  <text start="145.05" dur="6.54">so remember not to address just the</text>
  <text start="149.97" dur="4.17">person that you&amp;#39;re talking to that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="151.59" dur="5.36">useless debate and if no one&amp;#39;s watching</text>
  <text start="154.14" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s a useless debate remember to always</text>
  <text start="156.95" dur="6.7">keep up appearances for the folks who</text>
  <text start="159.57" dur="6.21">are maybe on the fence maybe they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="163.65" dur="4.2">been to see if maybe they have liked me</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;ve trusted someone for for over a</text>
  <text start="167.85" dur="3.21">decade or something and they have a lot</text>
  <text start="169.44" dur="4.47">of respect for this person who is lying</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="5.49">to them alright so we&amp;#39;ve got a lot of</text>
  <text start="173.91" dur="4.68">questionable fake nagas out there now</text>
  <text start="176.55" dur="6.78">one of the biggest deciding factors is</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="6.6">of course are they shadow band so in an</text>
  <text start="183.33" dur="3.57">age of overt censorship everywhere this</text>
  <text start="185.19" dur="3.42">is not even in dispute everyone knows</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="3.96">conservatives are being shadow band and</text>
  <text start="188.61" dur="5.07">censored left and right so in an age of</text>
  <text start="190.86" dur="6.18">that why are certain people in the old</text>
  <text start="193.68" dur="4.74">media I don&amp;#39;t even need to name names at</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="2.88">this point you know and you can go to</text>
  <text start="198.42" dur="4.32">your own search and figure out whose</text>
  <text start="199.92" dur="4.2">shadow band who&amp;#39;s not there are testers</text>
  <text start="202.74" dur="7.74">on the Google that you can just look up</text>
  <text start="204.12" dur="9.51">Twitter shadow band tester I think that</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="5.88">we are in a situation where it&amp;#39;s quite</text>
  <text start="213.63" dur="6.48">apparent and the lines are being you</text>
  <text start="216.36" dur="5.73">know drawn and there&amp;#39;s a lot of anger</text>
  <text start="220.11" dur="4.23">both sides and I don&amp;#39;t encourage that I</text>
  <text start="222.09" dur="6.24">speak from a place of justice but love</text>
  <text start="224.34" dur="8.46">and and logic reason and evidence of</text>
  <text start="228.33" dur="5.88">course okay people are our message and</text>
  <text start="232.8" dur="7.53">meet like crazy here sorry I might have</text>
  <text start="234.21" dur="7.77">to go to a speech in person but so you</text>
  <text start="240.33" dur="3.33">know at this point I think that the</text>
  <text start="241.98" dur="4.53">shadow van thing is very telling</text>
  <text start="243.66" dur="5.13">all right there are there seems to be a</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="4.2">line between the cue people in the alt</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="3.6">media and the anti cue people in the alt</text>
  <text start="250.71" dur="3.69">media and I can&amp;#39;t find too many of the</text>
  <text start="252.39" dur="4.8">anti cue people who are shadow band and</text>
  <text start="254.4" dur="5.97">I can can&amp;#39;t find anyone whose pro-q who</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="4.71">is not shadow band even if and you may</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="3.76">not believe this until you check it for</text>
  <text start="261.9" dur="4.66">yourself but even if you only have</text>
  <text start="264.13" dur="5.49">or two or maybe no followers on your</text>
  <text start="266.56" dur="4.71">Twitter account and of course YouTube</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="3.69">and Facebook they&amp;#39;re doing similar</text>
  <text start="271.27" dur="3.99">things as well the shadow that the term</text>
  <text start="273.31" dur="3.48">shadow band is is largely linked to</text>
  <text start="275.26" dur="4.32">Twitter but we&amp;#39;ve kind of used it for</text>
  <text start="276.79" dur="4.53">for for other things now as well like</text>
  <text start="279.58" dur="7.95">YouTube and they do their own algorithms</text>
  <text start="281.32" dur="8.61">okay they have it too so you know this</text>
  <text start="287.53" dur="5.72">is just my position I can&amp;#39;t prove to you</text>
  <text start="289.93" dur="9">that every single anti queue person is</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="7.81">is a hill or a propagandist or paid off</text>
  <text start="298.93" dur="5.46">by that hundred and something million</text>
  <text start="301.06" dur="5.61">dollars that we found out about I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="304.39" dur="4.56">know for sure I just know that I can</text>
  <text start="306.67" dur="4.05">extrapolate and reason that something is</text>
  <text start="308.95" dur="4.02">highly suspect especially when they only</text>
  <text start="310.72" dur="6.72">use you know pretty much insults like</text>
  <text start="312.97" dur="6.45">cult or LARP or stupid or you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="317.44" dur="3.72">reason or things like that well it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="319.42" dur="4.38">an argument you saying it doesn&amp;#39;t prove</text>
  <text start="321.16" dur="4.05">it and I will also make a point you know</text>
  <text start="323.8" dur="3.78">I heard someone mention this from</text>
  <text start="325.21" dur="6.3">seedling frogs Channel and I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="6.54">exactly his quote but basically like if</text>
  <text start="331.51" dur="5.34">you received an anonymous email that had</text>
  <text start="334.12" dur="4.95">some questions that upon reading these</text>
  <text start="336.85" dur="4.2">questions you decided to seek out the</text>
  <text start="339.07" dur="3.6">answers you know through public</text>
  <text start="341.05" dur="4.68">information and those answers were</text>
  <text start="342.67" dur="7.59">really good information to you you know</text>
  <text start="345.73" dur="5.97">so Socratic method and at that point you</text>
  <text start="350.26" dur="3.6">may be curious about who sent you that</text>
  <text start="351.7" dur="4.41">email and you may be grateful that they</text>
  <text start="353.86" dur="4.02">sent you that email and that they led</text>
  <text start="356.11" dur="4.05">you down that path to discover these</text>
  <text start="357.88" dur="4.8">important things that you would use but</text>
  <text start="360.16" dur="4.23">would it really matter who sent the</text>
  <text start="362.68" dur="3.6">email would it matter if it was a I</text>
  <text start="364.39" dur="3.18">would it matter if it was a fake person</text>
  <text start="366.28" dur="3.74">would it matter if it was a bum on the</text>
  <text start="367.57" dur="5.79">street would it matter if it was a LARP</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="6.7">not to me I would be grateful I try to</text>
  <text start="373.36" dur="4.83">say things but you know obviously they</text>
  <text start="376.72" dur="3.87">would want if you know I might even ask</text>
  <text start="378.19" dur="4.82">but if they want to remain anonymous I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="380.59" dur="4.91">respect that and in this</text>
  <text start="383.01" dur="5.61">cloak-and-dagger war that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="385.5" dur="7.93">absolutely 100% of war people are dying</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="7.18">okay then yes I think that it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="393.43" dur="3.81">thing to to maintain that and</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="3">I think that&amp;#39;s why they did it in the</text>
  <text start="397.24" dur="4.65">Revolutionary War when we broke away</text>
  <text start="398.8" dur="4.29">from tyranny and oppression and the king</text>
  <text start="401.89" dur="4.05">and the monarchy</text>
  <text start="403.09" dur="5.37">they were anonymous they were anon</text>
  <text start="405.94" dur="5.04">Patriots who posted things on the church</text>
  <text start="408.46" dur="3.99">board or you know the local town hall or</text>
  <text start="410.98" dur="3.72">whatever they would they would copy</text>
  <text start="412.45" dur="3.81">these things out handwritten paper was</text>
  <text start="414.7" dur="3.03">very valuable throughout history folks</text>
  <text start="416.26" dur="3.33">we didn&amp;#39;t always have you know like</text>
  <text start="417.73" dur="3.6">going to Staples and buying stacks of it</text>
  <text start="419.59" dur="3.51">paper was very valuable these people</text>
  <text start="421.33" dur="4.05">would dedicate their time their</text>
  <text start="423.1" dur="3.78">resources their effort their ingenuity</text>
  <text start="425.38" dur="5.31">their innovation their intelligence</text>
  <text start="426.88" dur="7.68">their blood their sweat their tears just</text>
  <text start="430.69" dur="6.17">like today and just like today they were</text>
