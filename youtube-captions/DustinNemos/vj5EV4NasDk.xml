  <text start="61.76" dur="4.609">of money but it is you know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="64.309" dur="4.56">signal for more things to come really</text>

  <text start="104.479" dur="4.14">like that stuff folks these people have</text>
  <text start="106.31" dur="4.799">no loyalty to the US they their loyalty</text>
  <text start="108.619" dur="3.691">is only to themselves and therefore the</text>
  <text start="111.109" dur="3.69">voting base that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="112.31" dur="4.29">pander to they want those illegal</text>
  <text start="114.799" dur="4.56">immigrant voters because they think</text>
  <text start="116.6" dur="5.159">they&amp;#39;re gonna somehow ride that to a</text>
  <text start="119.359" dur="8.691">longer-term victory in the polls in the</text>
  <text start="121.759" dur="10.681">voting booths there was a isis-inspired</text>
  <text start="128.05" dur="9.31">bombing attempt a teenager at a high</text>
  <text start="132.44" dur="7.53">school in Utah he tried but failed to</text>
  <text start="137.36" dur="3.29">detonate a bomb he&amp;#39;s being charged with</text>
  <text start="139.97" dur="3.799">it</text>
  <text start="140.65" dur="4.86">and you know this is just a disturbing</text>
  <text start="143.769" dur="3.541">trend going on lately I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="145.51" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s cellphone and kale true stuff or</text>
  <text start="147.31" dur="5.49">what but I do know that it&amp;#39;s disturbing</text>
  <text start="150.97" dur="6.21">to see so many students trying to kill</text>
  <text start="152.8" dur="5.73">each other it&amp;#39;s not natural for so many</text>
  <text start="157.18" dur="4.8">young people to be doing that what is</text>
  <text start="158.53" dur="5.88">going on with our society you know I</text>
  <text start="161.98" dur="5.33">talked about the heroin epidemic and how</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="5.159">most of those children are actually on</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="4.02">these drugs because they were abused as</text>
  <text start="169.569" dur="5.7">children either physically or sexually</text>
  <text start="171.33" dur="8.55">and I think this has something to do</text>
  <text start="175.269" dur="6.481">with that as well it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an epidemic</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="4.27">even when I was growing up and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="181.75" dur="3.84">that old I&amp;#39;m 130 when I was growing up</text>
  <text start="184.15" dur="5.729">we didn&amp;#39;t see this kind of gun violence</text>
  <text start="185.59" dur="5.85">in schools all the time my grandparents</text>
  <text start="189.879" dur="3.061">generation they had rifles school I</text>
  <text start="191.44" dur="3.78">think my dad&amp;#39;s generation had rifles</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="4.59">school you know they would have guns in</text>
  <text start="195.22" dur="4.71">class and use them and learn how to use</text>
  <text start="197.53" dur="4.289">guns you didn&amp;#39;t have these kind of</text>
  <text start="199.93" dur="4.589">issues then for multiple reasons one the</text>
  <text start="201.819" dur="3.781">culture wasn&amp;#39;t so degraded and 2 they</text>
  <text start="204.519" dur="5.011">would have shot you for trying to shoot</text>
  <text start="205.6" dur="9.359">up the rest of the school now moving on</text>
  <text start="209.53" dur="7.47">to Florida and the topic of guns the</text>
  <text start="214.959" dur="4.86">Florida Senate passes a bill it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="217" dur="5.22">of a good and a bad on the one hand it</text>
  <text start="219.819" dur="4.081">does allow for some use of guns by</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="3.419">school personnel not teachers in the</text>
  <text start="223.9" dur="4.169">classrooms but you know like coaches and</text>
  <text start="225.639" dur="4.44">stuff I don&amp;#39;t know why that they would</text>
  <text start="228.069" dur="4.95">do that obviously that&amp;#39;s some kind of</text>
  <text start="230.079" dur="5.101">Democrat logic but classroom teachers</text>
  <text start="233.019" dur="3.87">were not concluded but they did also</text>
  <text start="235.18" dur="5.73">raise the minimum age to purchase guns</text>
  <text start="236.889" dur="7.111">which is unconstitutional as well and</text>
  <text start="240.91" dur="7.189">they created longer waiting periods and</text>
  <text start="244" dur="6.389">it&amp;#39;s still narrowly passed 22 18 I think</text>
  <text start="248.099" dur="5.89">true pundit</text>
  <text start="250.389" dur="6.061">reveals the deputy that gave the order</text>
  <text start="253.989" dur="5.97">to stand down for those police that were</text>
  <text start="256.45" dur="6.33">outside the school when the shooting was</text>
  <text start="259.959" dur="5.941">happening and the name of that person is</text>
  <text start="262.78" dur="4.74">captain Jan your deny was in charge of</text>
  <text start="265.9" dur="4.769">the Broward County deputies at the scene</text>
  <text start="267.52" dur="4.5">law enforcement sources told Fox and was</text>
  <text start="270.669" dur="2.731">the officer who instructed her</text>
  <text start="272.02" dur="4.26">colleagues to remain outside</text>
  <text start="273.4" dur="4.41">the scene of a massive shooting even</text>
  <text start="276.28" dur="3.51">though department policies indicate that</text>
  <text start="277.81" dur="7.889">officers can enter such a scene to</text>
  <text start="279.79" dur="7.98">neutralize the shooter the sheriff found</text>
  <text start="285.699" dur="4.321">there Israel the corrupt crooked sheriff</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="6.51">who has all sorts of connections to</text>
  <text start="290.02" dur="5.82">crime and and unethical behavior and to</text>
  <text start="294.28" dur="5.28">debbie Wasserman Schultz and all of that</text>
  <text start="295.84" dur="6.21">stuff that&amp;#39;s going on he backs out of</text>
  <text start="299.56" dur="6">his promise to let the public see the</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="8.67">video of the shooting from the I guess</text>
  <text start="305.56" dur="9.45">one of the officers body cams the hero</text>
  <text start="310.72" dur="12.259">student Anthony Borg as Borges I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="315.01" dur="10.62">know how to say it is suing the school</text>
  <text start="322.979" dur="5.681">and I think also the Sheriff&amp;#39;s Office</text>
  <text start="325.63" dur="6.18">he&amp;#39;s 15 years old he used his body as a</text>
  <text start="328.66" dur="5.97">human shield to protect other students</text>
  <text start="331.81" dur="4.74">when the shooter targeted them getting</text>
  <text start="334.63" dur="3.39">hit with five bullets and winding up</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="4.23">with injuries so severe that he cannot</text>
  <text start="338.02" dur="4.83">walk I know how that is I can&amp;#39;t walk I</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="3.48">haven&amp;#39;t been able to walk in 24 hours my</text>
  <text start="342.85" dur="4.49">wife has to help me walk today</text>
  <text start="344.26" dur="6.92">this sucks I&amp;#39;m just a old back injury</text>
  <text start="347.34" dur="3.84">messed about messing with lungs</text>
  <text start="352.67" dur="5.71">he has joined his family to file suit</text>
  <text start="356.97" dur="3.09">against the Broward County Sheriff&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.38" dur="3.45">Office the school resource officer the</text>
  <text start="360.06" dur="3.75">Broward County school system and the</text>
  <text start="361.83" dur="4.71">principal at the Marjory Stoneman</text>
  <text start="363.81" dur="4.74">Douglas High School he was hit by</text>
  <text start="366.54" dur="5.46">bullets twice in his right leg once in</text>
  <text start="368.55" dur="4.86">his left leg and twice in his torso this</text>
  <text start="372" dur="2.1">kid basically threw himself on the</text>
  <text start="373.41" dur="5.07">landmine</text>
  <text start="374.1" dur="7.35">for his fellow kids and he paid a heavy</text>
  <text start="378.48" dur="5.97">price now of course he&amp;#39;s gonna be a hero</text>
  <text start="381.45" dur="5.55">and I cannot see him losing this lawsuit</text>
  <text start="384.45" dur="4.44">for sure so wonderful that he will</text>
  <text start="387" dur="5.61">hopefully we&amp;#39;ll see some justice in the</text>
  <text start="388.89" dur="6.15">form of a payout but of course anytime</text>
  <text start="392.61" dur="4.5">you sue in government it&amp;#39;s just other</text>
  <text start="395.04" dur="3.96">people that are being stolen from to pay</text>
  <text start="397.11" dur="3.45">for it so it&amp;#39;s not really I mean the</text>
  <text start="399" dur="3.98">sheriff&amp;#39;s not gonna get sued he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="400.56" dur="4.47">he&amp;#39;s not gonna lose any money it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="402.98" dur="4.87">taxpayers that are gonna front the bill</text>
  <text start="405.03" dur="4.44">for all the unethical behavior and we</text>
  <text start="407.85" dur="3.81">wonder why there&amp;#39;s so much unethical</text>
  <text start="409.47" dur="4.14">behavior in government because they</text>
  <text start="411.66" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t they have no liability personally</text>
  <text start="413.61" dur="2.88">they can get away with it and then you</text>
  <text start="414.81" dur="3.87">pay the bill for their bad stuff I mean</text>
  <text start="416.49" dur="4.44">look at Congress with all the hidden</text>
  <text start="418.68" dur="4.5">payouts for sex crimes and sexual</text>
  <text start="420.93" dur="3.87">assault sexual harassment millions of</text>
  <text start="423.18" dur="5.31">dollars and nobody know about it until</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="6.81">recently we have to pay for all of that</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="5.97">sexual deviancy folks this is why I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="431.61" dur="5.04">big fan of crypto now let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="434.46" dur="4.5">the deep state war and the cueing on</text>
  <text start="436.65" dur="3.66">relevant stuff it&amp;#39;s not posts or</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="4.2">anything but it&amp;#39;s relevant to what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.31" dur="6.57">going on behind the scenes so Mike Flynn</text>
  <text start="443.16" dur="7.8">jr. is sending a message to supporters</text>
  <text start="446.88" dur="6.45">following the widely circulated news</text>
  <text start="450.96" dur="3.99">that his dad is selling their Virginia</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="3.54">home to pay for the mounting legal fees</text>
  <text start="454.95" dur="5.82">obviously general Flynn was railroaded</text>
  <text start="456.87" dur="6.15">by this Mueller investigation made to be</text>
  <text start="460.77" dur="3.93">a they&amp;#39;re trying to make an example of</text>
  <text start="463.02" dur="3.78">him they&amp;#39;re trying to bring him down</text>
  <text start="464.7" dur="4.32">over some BS he didn&amp;#39;t really do</text>
  <text start="466.8" dur="7.41">anything immoral or wrong he got caught</text>
  <text start="469.02" dur="6.51">in a lie to the FBI that&amp;#39;s really it so</text>
  <text start="474.21" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;ve got him on like a technicality</text>
  <text start="475.53" dur="4.8">and and that&amp;#39;s easy to do with these</text>
  <text start="477.9" dur="4.62">these investigations where they try to</text>
  <text start="480.33" dur="3.69">catch you in some sort of a lie they</text>
  <text start="482.52" dur="2.94">grill you for eight hours and then if</text>
  <text start="484.02" dur="1.92">you say the wrong thing you were going</text>
  <text start="485.46" dur="3.27">to jail</text>
  <text start="485.94" dur="4.23">basically so this is just more evidence</text>
  <text start="488.73" dur="4.26">as to why you should never ever ever</text>
  <text start="490.17" dur="4.14">ever talk to police good police bad</text>
  <text start="492.99" dur="4.17">police any police you should never talk</text>
  <text start="494.31" dur="5.61">to them period there are plenty of</text>
  <text start="497.16" dur="4.32">lawyers who on you to have done videos</text>
  <text start="499.92" dur="5.43">as to why you should never talk to</text>
  <text start="501.48" dur="5.16">police various examples even if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="505.35" dur="3.92">innocent especially for innocent you</text>
  <text start="506.64" dur="7.44">should never talk to police</text>
  <text start="509.27" dur="7.84">now interestingly here do nothing Gowdy</text>
  <text start="514.08" dur="6.12">over there and Goodlatte are also</text>
  <text start="517.11" dur="6.15">calling for a second special counsel so</text>
  <text start="520.2" dur="5.7">maybe he is going to earn his way out of</text>
  <text start="523.26" dur="4.92">that and do nothing status you know we</text>
  <text start="525.9" dur="3.78">all love Gaudi for what he for his words</text>
  <text start="528.18" dur="3.36">you know he likes to grill them he asked</text>
  <text start="529.68" dur="3.57">the right questions and then he kind of</text>
  <text start="531.54" dur="4.68">backs off on holding anybody accountable</text>
  <text start="533.25" dur="4.71">doesn&amp;#39;t really do much in that regard so</text>
  <text start="536.22" dur="3.63">maybe this is a step in the right</text>
  <text start="537.96" dur="4.59">direction for Gaudi you know I was a big</text>
  <text start="539.85" dur="5.91">fan of Gaudi until so many times he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.55" dur="6.89">just let them off tried to vouch for the</text>
  <text start="545.76" dur="3.68">FBI&amp;#39;s reputation and things like that</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="6.64">you can only plead ignorance for so long</text>
  <text start="552.36" dur="5.94">with that if it looks like a dog talks</text>
  <text start="556.59" dur="5.1">like a duck quacks like a duck walks</text>
  <text start="558.3" dur="5.49">like a duck it&amp;#39;s probably a duck so if</text>
  <text start="561.69" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s in the FBI&amp;#39;s case if it&amp;#39;s crooked</text>
  <text start="563.79" dur="4.02">and corrupt and does bad things all the</text>
  <text start="566.07" dur="3.9">time and we have a clear pattern</text>
  <text start="567.81" dur="6.78">throughout history of their abuse it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="569.97" dur="7.5">probably evil so you don&amp;#39;t get to defend</text>
  <text start="574.59" dur="4.95">them and hold off on holding people</text>
  <text start="577.47" dur="4.35">accountable without being held</text>
  <text start="579.54" dur="4.62">accountable yourself so you know for me</text>
  <text start="581.82" dur="4.71">Gaudi was not anything special anymore</text>
  <text start="584.16" dur="6.679">but I would very excited to see that</text>
  <text start="586.53" dur="9">he&amp;#39;s doing this Sarah Carter is</text>
  <text start="590.839" dur="6.641">investigating what&amp;#39;s going on and she is</text>
  <text start="595.53" dur="4.16">suggesting now that John Kerry is</text>
  <text start="597.48" dur="5.33">officially under investigation himself</text>
  <text start="599.69" dur="5.74">connected to the dossier probe and</text>
  <text start="602.81" dur="5.02">they&amp;#39;re going through the Obama State</text>
  <text start="605.43" dur="5.909">Department now so that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="607.83" dur="5.22">interesting John Kerry has kind of</text>
  <text start="611.339" dur="3.931">largely been out of the news I mean he</text>
  <text start="613.05" dur="3.45">was talking about becoming president he</text>
  <text start="615.27" dur="3.78">had some stuff going on in the Middle</text>
  <text start="616.5" dur="3.279">East there for a while but he&amp;#39;s a bad</text>
  <text start="619.05" dur="2.37">guy too and</text>
  <text start="619.779" dur="3.781">don&amp;#39;t really talk or hear about it much</text>
  <text start="621.42" dur="4.719">so it&amp;#39;s interesting that he&amp;#39;s now being</text>
  <text start="623.56" dur="5.37">brought into the volt US Justice</text>
  <text start="626.139" dur="5.791">Department says it reaches conditional</text>
  <text start="628.93" dur="4.5">settlement agreement to begin to produce</text>
  <text start="631.93" dur="4.92">additional documents related to</text>
  <text start="633.43" dur="6.329">Operation Fast and Furious to the House</text>
  <text start="636.85" dur="4.859">Oversight Committee this is from NBC so</text>
  <text start="639.759" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;re gonna start seeing more documents</text>
  <text start="641.709" dur="5.61">come out about the Operation Fast &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="644.829" dur="6.48">Furious which is Obama&amp;#39;s gun-running</text>
  <text start="647.319" dur="5.64">campaign to you know to fuel I believe</text>
