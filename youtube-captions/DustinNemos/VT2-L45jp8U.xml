  <text start="809.509" dur="4.471">dinner for her husband that&amp;#39;s that was</text>
  <text start="811.55" dur="3.81">just past Sunday so I I think she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="813.98" dur="3.39">doing but I said I&amp;#39;d give her call in a</text>
  <text start="815.36" dur="4.019">week or two but last I talked to her she</text>
  <text start="817.37" dur="3.54">was just an advance to that party and</text>
  <text start="819.379" dur="2.971">that was kept her mind busy and she was</text>
  <text start="820.91" dur="3.63">happy that the book got off to a good</text>
  <text start="822.35" dur="4.289">start so she knew those couple things</text>
  <text start="824.54" dur="2.46">but I&amp;#39;ve not touched base with her since</text>
  <text start="826.639" dur="2.281">that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="827" dur="3.33">ceremony well you know I hope that</text>
  <text start="828.92" dur="2.67">people will go out and buy your book not</text>
  <text start="830.33" dur="3.03">only because it will help the movement</text>
  <text start="831.59" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;ll help others to learn this stuff</text>
  <text start="833.36" dur="3.27">but also because maybe we&amp;#39;ll share her</text>
  <text start="835.19" dur="3.87">up a little bit you know she&amp;#39;s had a</text>
  <text start="836.63" dur="4.47">very hard time and she&amp;#39;s she I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="839.06" dur="4.44">saying that she was poisoned because of</text>
  <text start="841.1" dur="3.87">the first book I do suspect that it may</text>
  <text start="843.5" dur="3.21">be the case especially because they</text>
  <text start="844.97" dur="3.54">couldn&amp;#39;t figure out a lot of the details</text>
  <text start="846.71" dur="4.05">and what kind of poison was used and</text>
  <text start="848.51" dur="4.08">stuff and and and I do want to kind of</text>
  <text start="850.76" dur="4.14">talk to you about that and get your take</text>
  <text start="852.59" dur="5.04">on it but she still paid a pretty heavy</text>
  <text start="854.9" dur="4.2">price lately anyway so you know even if</text>
  <text start="857.63" dur="3.48">she wasn&amp;#39;t targeted for the first book</text>
  <text start="859.1" dur="3.81">yeah it would show her some support as</text>
  <text start="861.11" dur="3.93">well and you know she is a patriot that</text>
  <text start="862.91" dur="4.11">needs it now she&amp;#39;s alone and that&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="865.04" dur="6.81">husband anything and she&amp;#39;s up there in</text>

  <text start="893.089" dur="4.921">way it was just terrible luck but I</text>
  <text start="896.089" dur="3.451">think it was as far as people have asked</text>
  <text start="898.01" dur="3.39">and asked there&amp;#39;s been some stories out</text>
  <text start="899.54" dur="3.27">there and again I was talking to her</text>
  <text start="901.4" dur="2.61">when this happened I mean when it first</text>
  <text start="902.81" dur="3.029">happened the beginning of the summer</text>
  <text start="904.01" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re both poisoned mysteriously I</text>
  <text start="905.839" dur="4.021">doubt really at the same time he she</text>
  <text start="908.12" dur="5.73">went in first the hospital then he came</text>
  <text start="909.86" dur="6.21">and came followed her and she was in and</text>
  <text start="913.85" dur="4.38">out he never really recovered every time</text>
  <text start="916.07" dur="5.01">I talked to her she&amp;#39;d say he&amp;#39;s doing bad</text>
  <text start="918.23" dur="4.8">he&amp;#39;s back in the hospital and at this</text>
  <text start="921.08" dur="3.69">point I was I was trying to explain</text>
  <text start="923.03" dur="3.059">somebody is it&amp;#39;s they didn&amp;#39;t take it</text>
  <text start="924.77" dur="2.64">seriously when they first went in</text>
  <text start="926.089" dur="3.211">because so many people get sick and</text>
  <text start="927.41" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s all types of different types of</text>
  <text start="929.3" dur="4.05">you know poisoning type of things in</text>
  <text start="931.37" dur="3.42">Mexico to begin with he was</text>
  <text start="933.35" dur="4.38">international and of course she&amp;#39;s lived</text>
  <text start="934.79" dur="4.62">there 30 40 years but and nothing</text>
  <text start="937.73" dur="3.15">unusual wasn&amp;#39;t like they went somewhere</text>
  <text start="939.41" dur="3">it was just out of the blue that this</text>
  <text start="940.88" dur="3.81">happened but they can&amp;#39;t get the</text>
  <text start="942.41" dur="3.66">toxicology because that was back in June</text>
  <text start="944.69" dur="2.97">and they&amp;#39;re trying to go back now</text>
  <text start="946.07" dur="3.42">because they didn&amp;#39;t a treated as a death</text>
  <text start="947.66" dur="3.9">or any type of suspicious and they</text>
  <text start="949.49" dur="3.96">didn&amp;#39;t really run all the labs and tests</text>
  <text start="951.56" dur="4.77">they probably should have so right now</text>
  <text start="953.45" dur="4.98">they can&amp;#39;t even diagnose the toxin so</text>
  <text start="956.33" dur="3.78">that adds a big element to it but you</text>
  <text start="958.43" dur="2.219">know she was ostracized like you said</text>
  <text start="960.11" dur="2.55">Dustin</text>
  <text start="960.649" dur="3.36">for any of this happened just by her</text>

  <text start="972.35" dur="3.089">going on in her you know you know I want</text>
  <text start="974.149" dur="2.521">to bring something up and this is</text>
  <text start="975.439" dur="3.661">something that I&amp;#39;ve never talked about</text>
