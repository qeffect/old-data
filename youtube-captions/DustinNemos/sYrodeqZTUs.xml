  <text start="43.98" dur="6.989">that creation where a turn of media</text>

  <text start="184.58" dur="4.41">okay how are you guys tonight</text>
  <text start="192.4" dur="6.69">that&amp;#39;s awesome Jonathan I really</text>
  <text start="195.519" dur="5.97">recommend if you&amp;#39;re doing the c60 look</text>
  <text start="199.09" dur="4.35">into olive oil quality and like do some</text>
  <text start="201.489" dur="6.75">research on that that whole field is a</text>
  <text start="203.44" dur="7.29">landmine or even find another type of</text>
  <text start="208.239" dur="3.541">oil to use because just all olive oil is</text>
  <text start="210.73" dur="3.21">one of the best things in the world to</text>
  <text start="211.78" dur="4.349">take but only like 2% of those companies</text>
  <text start="213.94" dur="7.07">are actually legitimate high-quality</text>
  <text start="216.129" dur="4.881">fresh you know pure</text>
  <text start="224.3" dur="6.06">same sheriff that said the what it was a</text>
  <text start="226.61" dur="5.85">quote the Lions don&amp;#39;t listen to the</text>
  <text start="230.36" dur="3.78">opinions of sheep I think that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="232.46" dur="7.32">saddam hussein quote i&amp;#39;m not sure about</text>
  <text start="234.14" dur="6.69">that but the sheriff said that yeah i</text>
  <text start="239.78" dur="2.91">don&amp;#39;t i don&amp;#39;t see anything wrong with</text>
  <text start="240.83" dur="3.93">grapeseed oil i don&amp;#39;t think that comes</text>
  <text start="242.69" dur="3.45">in GMOs that&amp;#39;s probably pretty safe i</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="3.6">mean most of those oils are pretty</text>
  <text start="246.14" dur="5.04">healthy i just i would avoid the GMO i</text>
  <text start="248.36" dur="7.56">would avoid the lake the vegetable oils</text>
  <text start="251.18" dur="10.2">the canola oils anything GMO or maybe</text>
  <text start="255.92" dur="7.38">GMO or just low-quality a friend of mine</text>
  <text start="261.38" dur="4.11">makes colloidal silver very cheaply</text>
  <text start="263.3" dur="5.66">which is awesome because i will</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="3.47">definitely use so much of that as I can</text>
  <text start="271.33" dur="5.95">okay so even organic olive oil is</text>
  <text start="274.25" dur="8.3">probably still crap because it can be</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="10.14">organic and still like impure rotten</text>
  <text start="282.55" dur="6.73">aged not fresh you know that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.42" dur="4.73">other things that go in there I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="289.28" dur="4.95">remember the names like the old</text>
  <text start="292.15" dur="5.83">polyphenols or something that&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="294.23" dur="5.58">fresh stuff that&amp;#39;s not in the not in</text>
  <text start="297.98" dur="8.49">most of them most of them are</text>
  <text start="299.81" dur="8.64">adulterated with with a sediment you</text>
  <text start="306.47" dur="4.77">know I think it&amp;#39;s been a long time since</text>
  <text start="308.45" dur="5.6">I did my research on it the California</text>
  <text start="311.24" dur="5.28">ranch I think it&amp;#39;s called or California</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="5.61">olive ranch or something like that they</text>

  <text start="337.78" dur="3.54">ar-15 that kind of stuff I&amp;#39;m afraid to</text>
  <text start="340.06" dur="5.16">talk about this topic because they&amp;#39;ll</text>

  <text start="476.07" dur="4.59">a few seconds I don&amp;#39;t know the best</text>
  <text start="479.1" dur="4.17">thing that you can do is follow me on</text>
  <text start="480.66" dur="6.27">Vimeo or D tube some people are having</text>
  <text start="483.27" dur="8.09">trouble with D tube and that&amp;#39;s fine they</text>
  <text start="486.93" dur="6.8">can do Vimeo save your quit scratching</text>

  <text start="493.73" dur="9.62">my dialogue over there and um let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="500.63" dur="6.24">where was I lost my train of thought</text>
  <text start="503.35" dur="5.35">yeah and gap gap if you are following me</text>
  <text start="506.87" dur="3.51">on gap that would be great because that</text>
  <text start="508.7" dur="3.9">would be a lot harder for them to censor</text>
  <text start="510.38" dur="3.21">me on and that&amp;#39;s pretty simple or even</text>
  <text start="512.6" dur="2.7">if you don&amp;#39;t want to make an account</text>
  <text start="513.59" dur="3.45">right now just write down the URL</text>

  <text start="517.04" dur="2.76">me after because if they banned me again</text>
  <text start="518.69" dur="3.979">it&amp;#39;s probably gonna happen on Twitter</text>
  <text start="519.8" dur="2.869">and Facebook too</text>
  <text start="524.36" dur="4.62">Praeger you versus YouTube I just did a</text>
  <text start="526.43" dur="4.68">video about it I&amp;#39;m excited about it</text>
  <text start="528.98" dur="3.83">I think it&amp;#39;s versus Google technically</text>
  <text start="531.11" dur="4.08">but yeah basically versus YouTube</text>
  <text start="532.81" dur="5.14">there&amp;#39;s another one as well versus</text>
  <text start="535.19" dur="5.43">Twitter from someone else and I did I I</text>
  <text start="537.95" dur="6.98">linked that in my descriptions I kind of</text>
  <text start="540.62" dur="8.64">briefly mentioned it in my last video</text>
  <text start="544.93" dur="6.76">steamin is overwhelmed so so schema is</text>
  <text start="549.26" dur="4.05">one of the only I think two platforms on</text>
  <text start="551.69" dur="5.07">the internet that are that is</text>
  <text start="553.31" dur="8.6">decentralized using their their D Tube</text>
  <text start="556.76" dur="7.92">service D tube like D combo tube instead</text>
  <text start="561.91" dur="4.72">using that service is one of the like</text>
  <text start="564.68" dur="4.23">the other one is bitch shoot those two</text>
  <text start="566.63" dur="10.11">services are decentralized and therefore</text>
  <text start="568.91" dur="10.56">basically unban able unsensible the the</text>
  <text start="576.74" dur="5.16">dollar amount next to the video on D</text>
  <text start="579.47" dur="4.71">tube is I think that that&amp;#39;s how much</text>
  <text start="581.9" dur="4.65">you&amp;#39;ve earned in steam dollars it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="584.18" dur="5.58">the same thing as cash dollars different</text>
  <text start="586.55" dur="4.86">value but you know when people up vote</text>
  <text start="589.76" dur="4.32">you and they they like donate a couple</text>
  <text start="591.41" dur="4.98">pennies here and there your videos can</text>
  <text start="594.08" dur="4.8">actually earn money on D tube which is</text>
  <text start="596.39" dur="6.2">cool because conservatives are D</text>
  <text start="598.88" dur="3.71">monetized on YouTube completely</text>
  <text start="605.29" dur="6.5">I don&amp;#39;t have a legal team Stephanie you</text>
  <text start="608.8" dur="5.55">guys are my legal team just mob pressure</text>
  <text start="611.79" dur="4.3">my strategy to beat censorship is to</text>
  <text start="614.35" dur="3.48">just outgrow it and get bigger and</text>
  <text start="616.09" dur="4.62">bigger notice that they haven&amp;#39;t banned</text>
  <text start="617.83" dur="4.82">Infowars are just threatening - those</text>
  <text start="620.71" dur="4.05">guys are huge</text>
  <text start="622.65" dur="4.33">well anti school and others are talking</text>
  <text start="624.76" dur="4.05">about the legal the legal perspective of</text>
  <text start="626.98" dur="3.21">things and I&amp;#39;m gonna let them see if</text>
  <text start="628.81" dur="3.51">they can get something going and I can</text>
  <text start="630.19" dur="4.38">join it I think that&amp;#39;s the plan right</text>
  <text start="632.32" dur="8.04">now I have no money for that stuff at</text>
  <text start="634.57" dur="11.01">all I don&amp;#39;t have the money to go against</text>
  <text start="640.36" dur="8.4">Google yeah coconut oil is probably an</text>
  <text start="645.58" dur="4.2">even better choice for the the c60</text>
  <text start="648.76" dur="4.19">because you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about</text>
  <text start="649.78" dur="6.6">all of the crap that&amp;#39;s in the olive oil</text>
  <text start="652.95" dur="5.38">industry however for me it&amp;#39;s so cold</text>
  <text start="656.38" dur="4.89">here that my coconut oil would basically</text>
  <text start="658.33" dur="7.59">solidify every time I went outside or or</text>
  <text start="661.27" dur="5.97">anything so I actually I don&amp;#39;t know if I</text>
  <text start="665.92" dur="4.2">can run it for two weeks without it</text>
  <text start="667.24" dur="7.35">going solid on me while I&amp;#39;m making the</text>
  <text start="670.12" dur="8.64">c60 you know I haven&amp;#39;t even bend a bit</text>
  <text start="674.59" dur="5.88">you yeah I I don&amp;#39;t know much about it I</text>
  <text start="678.76" dur="3.39">kind of went with d2 because I had read</text>
  <text start="680.47" dur="3.87">a little bit about steam it and I know</text>
  <text start="682.15" dur="4.02">they have a way to monetize and even</text>
  <text start="684.34" dur="3.71">people that comment can make money which</text>
  <text start="686.17" dur="3.81">I was excited about that for you guys</text>
  <text start="688.05" dur="5.32">you know if you leave a good comment</text>
  <text start="689.98" dur="6.54">people like it you can earn money but I</text>

  <text start="3261.62" dur="6.03">person because it&amp;#39;s in their nature yeah</text>
  <text start="3265.39" dur="6.43">there&amp;#39;s another really good parable</text>
  <text start="3267.65" dur="7.47">about a scorpion and a turtle what is it</text>
  <text start="3271.82" dur="11.73">this year was it was a while back right</text>
  <text start="3275.12" dur="10.38">oh he did it again okay that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="3283.55" dur="3.45">similar to I like his version that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3285.5" dur="4.55">very similar to the one I used to tell a</text>
  <text start="3287" dur="6.92">lot called the Scorpion and the turtle</text>
  <text start="3290.05" dur="7.12">where or the frog and the scorpion yeah</text>
  <text start="3293.92" dur="4.96">and this the Frog is convinced to give</text>
  <text start="3297.17" dur="3.24">the scorpion a ride across the river and</text>
  <text start="3298.88" dur="2.94">then you gets killed anyway and then</text>
  <text start="3300.41" dur="11.28">they both drown because it&amp;#39;s in his</text>
  <text start="3301.82" dur="12.38">nature it shows a Q Bruce I have to look</text>
  <text start="3311.69" dur="2.51">that up them</text>
  <text start="3326.64" dur="5.439">socialism and communism are basically</text>
  <text start="3328.959" dur="7.64">the same thing Stephanie in response to</text>
  <text start="3332.079" dur="6.75">that let me try to break it down so</text>
  <text start="3336.599" dur="4.17">socialism is the idea that the people</text>
  <text start="3338.829" dur="3.841">can vote to take your stuff away</text>
  <text start="3340.769" dur="3.371">communism is an idea that the government</text>
  <text start="3342.67" dur="3.619">can just take your stuff away they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3344.14" dur="4.559">both basically theft and redistribution</text>
  <text start="3346.289" dur="6.19">it&amp;#39;s just a matter of government versus</text>
  <text start="3348.699" dur="6.54">the mob now when you&amp;#39;re looking at some</text>
  <text start="3352.479" dur="5.88">cultural Marxism as it&amp;#39;s called that is</text>
  <text start="3355.239" dur="6.6">more of a tactic like originally Marxism</text>
  <text start="3358.359" dur="6.84">was to divide the proletariat and the</text>
  <text start="3361.839" dur="7.53">bourgeoisie the the poor working man</text>
  <text start="3365.199" dur="5.82">versus the rich capitalist was the idea</text>
  <text start="3369.369" dur="5.7">they always painted the capitalist as</text>
  <text start="3371.019" dur="6.57">the bad guy it didn&amp;#39;t work in America</text>
  <text start="3375.069" dur="5.73">everyone here wanted to earn the way to</text>
  <text start="3377.589" dur="6.14">be rich like the capitalist so trying to</text>
  <text start="3380.799" dur="6.02">turn worker poor versus capitalist rich</text>
  <text start="3383.729" dur="6.36">wasn&amp;#39;t as effective so they switched to</text>
  <text start="3386.819" dur="6.16">race baiting and identity politics and</text>
  <text start="3390.089" dur="5.37">man versus woman and gave us astray and</text>
  <text start="3392.979" dur="5.46">all of that so that is like a form of</text>
  <text start="3395.459" dur="8.23">Marxism but it&amp;#39;s not the traditional</text>
  <text start="3398.439" dur="9.24">classical poor versus rich yep and we</text>
  <text start="3403.689" dur="5.82">are where democracy in their mind we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3407.679" dur="3.451">actually a republic but no one even</text>
  <text start="3409.509" dur="4.74">remembers that anymore so effectively</text>
  <text start="3411.13" dur="5.729">we&amp;#39;re a democracy we&amp;#39;re supposed to be a</text>
  <text start="3414.249" dur="4.44">limited government republic which is the</text>
  <text start="3416.859" dur="4.08">best form of government but all forms of</text>
  <text start="3418.689" dur="5">government are inherently corrupt and</text>
  <text start="3420.939" dur="5.28">will eventually end up being tyrannical</text>
  <text start="3423.689" dur="4.03">even one that had the Constitution</text>
  <text start="3426.219" dur="5.01">because look at what happened it would</text>
  <text start="3427.719" dur="6.96">happen again every time I was a</text>
  <text start="3431.229" dur="4.921">constitutional republic limited</text>
  <text start="3434.679" dur="4.26">government guy until I learned about</text>
  <text start="3436.15" dur="6.139">voluntary ISM and really got into</text>
  <text start="3438.939" dur="3.35">philosophy and economics</text>
  <text start="3447.92" dur="6.71">yeah I heard about that Roy Potter be</text>
  <text start="3450.079" dur="4.551">call sounded a little fishy</text>
  <text start="3455.72" dur="4.589">I don&amp;#39;t think so PJ as far as I</text>

  <text start="3487.759" dur="8.82">contributors I understand the different</text>
  <text start="3492.769" dur="7.04">you know segments but I would consider</text>
  <text start="3496.579" dur="5.821">myself a voluntary assuage which really</text>
  <text start="3499.809" dur="4.56">the technical term that you would</text>
  <text start="3502.4" dur="4.889">traditionally know that as is</text>
  <text start="3504.369" dur="4.361">anarcho-capitalist or voluntary</text>
  <text start="3507.289" dur="3.81">capitalist whatever you want to say I</text>
  <text start="3508.73" dur="3.869">believe that we should have a full</text>
  <text start="3511.099" dur="2.73">capitalist system which is not</text>
  <text start="3512.599" dur="3.47">compatible with the government of any</text>

  <text start="3516.369" dur="3.15">Avery I do</text>
  <text start="3530.21" dur="4.93">yeah philosophy has all the answers</text>
  <text start="3532.77" dur="4.89">hooks all the answers to all the</text>
  <text start="3535.14" dur="6.02">problems we face today and a lot of that</text>
  <text start="3537.66" dur="3.5">is actually an economic philosophy</text>
  <text start="3543.35" dur="6.28">because um economics is the most boring</text>
  <text start="3547.56" dur="3.81">topic of all right no one wants to talk</text>
  <text start="3549.63" dur="3.87">about that we want to talk about the</text>
  <text start="3551.37" dur="3.51">corruption we want to fight the evil but</text>
  <text start="3553.5" dur="3">we can&amp;#39;t even fully understand it</text>
  <text start="3554.88" dur="4.11">without understanding the philosophy the</text>
  <text start="3556.5" dur="4.5">history and the economics and every time</text>
  <text start="3558.99" dur="4.29">I bring up an economics or Bitcoin or</text>
  <text start="3561" dur="6.84">crypto or anything like that people tune</text>
  <text start="3563.28" dur="8.34">me out they don&amp;#39;t want to hear it so the</text>
  <text start="3567.84" dur="6.99">only way to to address the root cause of</text>
  <text start="3571.62" dur="5.37">all this corruption and to limit it most</text>
  <text start="3574.83" dur="5.82">effectively the way the Constitution</text>
  <text start="3576.99" dur="7.79">tried to do is to eliminate all</text>
  <text start="3580.65" dur="4.13">government and that&amp;#39;s my opinion</text>
  <text start="3587.48" dur="7.89">yeah basically you got it BTC as long as</text>
  <text start="3591.26" dur="6.75">there&amp;#39;s a government someone&amp;#39;s gonna use</text>
  <text start="3595.37" dur="5.16">it too bad too bad ends to use it for</text>
  <text start="3598.01" dur="4.56">evil power will grow you know if you</text>
  <text start="3600.53" dur="3.87">have government and capitalism someone</text>
  <text start="3602.57" dur="3.96">will get so rich through capitalism or</text>
  <text start="3604.4" dur="3.63">limited capitalism that they&amp;#39;ll pay the</text>
  <text start="3606.53" dur="5.49">government off for perks and then you</text>
  <text start="3608.03" dur="5.67">have tyranny and fascism we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3612.02" dur="3.21">we&amp;#39;ve never really had full capitalism</text>
  <text start="3613.7" dur="3.57">but we have 60 percent of the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3615.23" dur="8.37">wealth off of a little bit of capitalism</text>
  <text start="3617.27" dur="8.31">folks so the opposite of what the Cabal</text>
  <text start="3623.6" dur="5.28">want with their one-world government</text>
  <text start="3625.58" dur="7.47">kitkat his voluntary ISM no government</text>
  <text start="3628.88" dur="5.19">every man has his own ruler no rulers he</text>
  <text start="3633.05" dur="2.28">doesn&amp;#39;t mean you don&amp;#39;t have laws that</text>
  <text start="3634.07" dur="2.73">doesn&amp;#39;t even mean that you can still</text>
  <text start="3635.33" dur="3.9">have police and courts and all of that</text>
  <text start="3636.8" dur="5.7">but you would not have any rulers you</text>
  <text start="3639.23" dur="5.33">would have competing private businesses</text>
  <text start="3642.5" dur="4.8">that have to compete for your money</text>
  <text start="3644.56" dur="10.27">through the free market not paying the</text>
  <text start="3647.3" dur="8.94">government offer for monopolies yeah</text>
  <text start="3654.83" dur="2.1">there&amp;#39;s a lot there&amp;#39;s a lot of leftists</text>

  <text start="3665.6" dur="7.99">Europe Europe is a socialist shithole</text>
  <text start="3670.61" dur="4.57">and they&amp;#39;re getting invaded by I mean</text>
  <text start="3673.59" dur="2.73">not all places there&amp;#39;s a few places that</text>
  <text start="3675.18" dur="3.51">are resisting the invasion of the</text>

  <text start="3694.64" dur="2.78">check that out thank you</text>
  <text start="3709.16" dur="2.99">interesting</text>
  <text start="3712.36" dur="7.29">you said Steve Botanica is a bad actor</text>
  <text start="3714.4" dur="10.64">and then the message was retracted he</text>
  <text start="3719.65" dur="5.39">might be probably as he&amp;#39;s ex-cia</text>
  <text start="3729.69" dur="5.7">Melvyn no I do not believe that</text>
  <text start="3731.64" dur="5.73">collapses the government collapse is</text>
  <text start="3735.39" dur="3.63">avoidable we&amp;#39;ve actually kind of gone a</text>
  <text start="3737.37" dur="3.03">little bit past the historical average</text>
  <text start="3739.02" dur="3.3">usually it&amp;#39;s about like two hundred</text>
  <text start="3740.4" dur="4.02">years or so before a government</text>
  <text start="3742.32" dur="3.42">collapses we&amp;#39;re because of debt and</text>
  <text start="3744.42" dur="6.39">everything we&amp;#39;re a little bit past that</text>
  <text start="3745.74" dur="8.22">I think so that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you</text>
  <text start="3750.81" dur="4.77">can live off of a rigged money system</text>
  <text start="3753.96" dur="3.51">completely manipulated and controlled</text>
  <text start="3755.58" dur="4.16">with all the distortion that that</text>
  <text start="3757.47" dur="5.25">creates for over a hundred years and</text>
  <text start="3759.74" dur="4.3">then just have Trump come in office and</text>
  <text start="3762.72" dur="4.53">fix everything and it does not work that</text>
  <text start="3764.04" dur="4.68">way you will pay the price for the bad</text>
  <text start="3767.25" dur="2.97">ideas and the bad things that you did</text>
  <text start="3768.72" dur="3.48">you&amp;#39;ll for the mistakes that you made</text>
  <text start="3770.22" dur="4.47">you will pay the price we have not paid</text>
  <text start="3772.2" dur="5.97">that price yet there&amp;#39;s something coming</text>
  <text start="3774.69" dur="8.06">folks mike maloney calls it the</text>
  <text start="3778.17" dur="9.36">everything bubble stocks bonds and</text>
  <text start="3782.75" dur="6.34">housing are in a big bubble and you know</text>
  <text start="3787.53" dur="5.58">I think that when that happens the</text>
  <text start="3789.09" dur="5.91">government will will be shrunk and we</text>
  <text start="3793.11" dur="3.36">will be looking at a new class of</text>
  <text start="3795" dur="4.23">wealthy people the ones that had gold</text>
  <text start="3796.47" dur="5.79">silver and cryptos the ones that had the</text>
  <text start="3799.23" dur="5.37">right assets but people that are in the</text>
  <text start="3802.26" dur="4.5">stock market or the housing market or</text>
  <text start="3804.6" dur="4.31">the bond market are going to lose</text>
  <text start="3806.76" dur="2.15">everything</text>
  <text start="3830.19" dur="3.599">yeah I really like mike maloney and his</text>
  <text start="3832.26" dur="2.839">approach is wonderful too because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3833.789" dur="4.351">not very threatening to people</text>
  <text start="3835.099" dur="7.5">he&amp;#39;s so mild-mannered he&amp;#39;s like mr.</text>

  <text start="3865.23" dur="4.36">Stacy that&amp;#39;s where they want us they</text>
  <text start="3867.22" dur="4.83">want to so dumb down sick and busy that</text>
  <text start="3869.59" dur="5.82">we can&amp;#39;t learn because when we learn</text>
  <text start="3872.05" dur="7.41">we&amp;#39;d become free or we at least desire</text>
  <text start="3875.41" dur="6.9">freedom it used to be that being</text>
  <text start="3879.46" dur="5.79">scholarly was considered to be the way</text>
  <text start="3882.31" dur="4.23">to go right like people had to books but</text>
  <text start="3885.25" dur="4.71">they learned to read and write better</text>
  <text start="3886.54" dur="4.77">than today&amp;#39;s high schoolers you know</text>
  <text start="3889.96" dur="4.11">they would teach themselves between</text>
  <text start="3891.31" dur="4.5">working on the farm and and everything</text>
  <text start="3894.07" dur="3.15">else they had to do they would they</text>
  <text start="3895.81" dur="3.41">would learn to write and read they would</text>
  <text start="3897.22" dur="5.58">do it very well</text>
  <text start="3899.22" dur="6.69">but they had time time is the most</text>
  <text start="3902.8" dur="3.11">precious thing we have folks</text>
  <text start="3908.859" dur="6.21">I do believe that Veritas</text>
  <text start="3911.89" dur="5.899">I think the Trump is doing his part I</text>
  <text start="3915.069" dur="5.19">think he was asked</text>
  <text start="3917.789" dur="5.381">he&amp;#39;s already sacrificed over a quarter</text>
  <text start="3920.259" dur="9.33">of his wealth according to WikiLeaks and</text>
  <text start="3923.17" dur="11.159">that&amp;#39;s an old number so I think I think</text>
  <text start="3929.589" dur="6.18">Trump is definitely hero status I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3934.329" dur="3.93">I don&amp;#39;t like the idea of the military</text>
  <text start="3935.769" dur="4.23">being in power either you know we were</text>
  <text start="3938.259" dur="5.221">warned about standing armies from the</text>
  <text start="3939.999" dur="4.74">founding fathers for a reason I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3943.48" dur="2.879">like the idea of a world of</text>
  <text start="3944.739" dur="3.391">cloak-and-dagger intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="3946.359" dur="3.99">because right now we may have them on</text>
  <text start="3948.13" dur="4.139">our side or some of them but look at</text>
  <text start="3950.349" dur="3.631">what happened I mean they almost took</text>
  <text start="3952.269" dur="2.31">over everything and controlled the whole</text>
  <text start="3953.98" dur="3.45">world forever</text>
  <text start="3954.579" dur="6.96">if they had won we would be we would be</text>
  <text start="3957.43" dur="5.819">slaves forever there would not be any</text>
  <text start="3961.539" dur="4.77">there&amp;#39;s no other chance past Trump folks</text>
  <text start="3963.249" dur="8.131">the technologies too far gone they</text>
  <text start="3966.309" dur="9.631">almost had us the next step was RFID</text>
  <text start="3971.38" dur="7.459">chips a control grid and the matrix</text>
  <text start="3975.94" dur="7.129">basically we would be living in a matrix</text>
  <text start="3978.839" dur="4.23">there have been attempts on Trump&amp;#39;s life</text>
  <text start="3986.77" dur="4.95">uh Tammy I think many of the military</text>
  <text start="3989.32" dur="4.74">corrupt sure I mean just just because</text>
  <text start="3991.72" dur="4.8">you join the work for the government for</text>
  <text start="3994.06" dur="3.69">a paycheck and you agreed to do violence</text>
  <text start="3996.52" dur="3.33">for them does not immediately make you a</text>
  <text start="3997.75" dur="3.66">moral person I know that there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="3999.85" dur="4.83">of military people in the Q movement and</text>
  <text start="4001.41" dur="4.68">I think they&amp;#39;re the good ones but there</text>
  <text start="4004.68" dur="2.79">are many bad people in the military as</text>
  <text start="4006.09" dur="4.2">well it&amp;#39;s just like with police you know</text>
  <text start="4007.47" dur="6.99">the the good ones aren&amp;#39;t doing anything</text>
  <text start="4010.29" dur="6.56">about the bad ones so just get rid of</text>
  <text start="4014.46" dur="2.39">all of them</text>
  <text start="4020.57" dur="6.56">a free man doesn&amp;#39;t have someone he</text>
  <text start="4022.49" dur="4.64">doesn&amp;#39;t need someone like the military</text>
  <text start="4034.5" dur="4.869">yeah Gary I think it&amp;#39;s a guarantee of</text>
  <text start="4036.88" dur="3.899">civil war if they kill Trump but I also</text>
  <text start="4039.369" dur="3.42">think that if they did kill Trump</text>
  <text start="4040.779" dur="4.29">there&amp;#39;s already on there&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="4042.789" dur="3.871">backup plans and military would be like</text>
  <text start="4045.069" dur="3.181">the Marines would be moving against</text>
  <text start="4046.66" dur="3.659">certain figures and take them out</text>
