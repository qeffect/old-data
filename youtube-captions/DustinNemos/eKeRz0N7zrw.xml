  <text start="71.02" dur="7.519">heard about it now that purge is coming</text>
  <text start="73.72" dur="4.819">so let&amp;#39;s dive into the queueing on posts</text>
  <text start="87.76" dur="5.29">all right so diving through some cue</text>
  <text start="90.17" dur="7.89">posts we have three five nine nine post</text>
  <text start="93.05" dur="6.9">$35.99 the harvest crop and kill box has</text>
  <text start="98.06" dur="4.62">been prepared and soon will be delivered</text>
  <text start="99.95" dur="4.46">to the public for consumption a higher</text>
  <text start="102.68" dur="5.91">loyalty which to me sounds like a</text>
  <text start="104.41" dur="6.34">reference to Comey you know another crop</text>
  <text start="108.59" dur="4.26">and corn reference as well call me</text>
  <text start="110.75" dur="4.74">himself and also his book a higher</text>
  <text start="112.85" dur="4.59">loyalty which you know he doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="115.49" dur="4.35">admit to what that is right</text>
  <text start="117.44" dur="3.12">so another like double meaning they love</text>
  <text start="119.84" dur="3.27">those things</text>
  <text start="120.56" dur="6.69">so there&amp;#39;s a why here in the kill box</text>
  <text start="123.11" dur="7.73">also hunters become the hunted treason</text>
  <text start="127.25" dur="6.3">sedition how do you remove a liability</text>
  <text start="130.84" dur="5.17">so this is talking about that justice</text>
  <text start="133.55" dur="5.58">phase earlier you know just a few you</text>
  <text start="136.01" dur="5.09">post back even indictments twenty</text>
  <text start="139.13" dur="5.13">nineteen remember that that&amp;#39;s a big post</text>
  <text start="141.1" dur="5.98">it&amp;#39;s a small post but a big boom meaning</text>
  <text start="144.26" dur="4.199">right so now he&amp;#39;s talking about treason</text>
  <text start="147.08" dur="4.14">sedition hunters become the hunted</text>
  <text start="148.459" dur="6.241">clearly he&amp;#39;s ramping right up into</text>
  <text start="151.22" dur="5.34">justice phase as I&amp;#39;ve called for quite a</text>
  <text start="154.7" dur="4.71">while now I I think it&amp;#39;s been fairly</text>
  <text start="156.56" dur="4.709">evident by the trends we&amp;#39;re already in</text>
  <text start="159.41" dur="4.44">it now that&amp;#39;s what this whole</text>
  <text start="161.269" dur="5.461">impeachment thing is it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.85" dur="7.29">the push too far that causes the</text>
  <text start="166.73" dur="6.66">boomerang to snap back right now the</text>
  <text start="171.14" dur="5.129">next thing is how do you remove a</text>
  <text start="173.39" dur="4.97">liability oh oh and before I even</text>
  <text start="176.269" dur="5.131">continue on from treason sedition</text>
  <text start="178.36" dur="6.55">definitely somewhat relevant to the AG</text>
  <text start="181.4" dur="7.35">Barr speech about how the Democrats are</text>
  <text start="184.91" dur="7.98">on every level trying to commit sedition</text>
  <text start="188.75" dur="5.97">and a poor and resist President Trump</text>
  <text start="192.89" dur="4.86">right so they&amp;#39;re basically trying to</text>
  <text start="194.72" dur="5.489">resist at every level by obstructing the</text>
  <text start="197.75" dur="6.15">executive branch and causing mischief</text>
  <text start="200.209" dur="6.721">just delaying obstructing the Obama</text>
  <text start="203.9" dur="5.52">holdover government right the Justice</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="3.959">Democrats of America group right these</text>
  <text start="209.42" dur="4.17">are the ones that have been caught even</text>
  <text start="210.889" dur="5.521">under cover and by Project Veritas and</text>
  <text start="213.59" dur="6.93">and all but have admitted it so</text>
  <text start="216.41" dur="5.85">this is exactly what sedition is right</text>
  <text start="220.52" dur="4.23">so this is where we&amp;#39;re heading this is</text>
  <text start="222.26" dur="3.6">the the steps being taken to prep the</text>
  <text start="224.75" dur="2.79">society for it</text>
  <text start="225.86" dur="3.87">Trump&amp;#39;s been saying treason treason</text>
  <text start="227.54" dur="3.63">treason for quite a while now AG bar is</text>
  <text start="229.73" dur="7.05">talking about the Democrats on a</text>
  <text start="231.17" dur="9.12">widespread level are trying to push</text>
  <text start="236.78" dur="5.67">against the executive too too far for</text>
  <text start="240.29" dur="5.19">one is one of the comments he kind of my</text>
  <text start="242.45" dur="5.7">words not his but he had talked about</text>
  <text start="245.48" dur="7.02">how they&amp;#39;re taking too many powers from</text>
  <text start="248.15" dur="6.51">the executive and and basically he sees</text>
  <text start="252.5" dur="5.52">that as a problem so we&amp;#39;re about to see</text>
  <text start="254.66" dur="5.25">some pushback now how do you remove a</text>
  <text start="258.02" dur="3.65">liability this is gonna be very</text>
  <text start="259.91" dur="4.44">interesting because people are</text>
  <text start="261.67" dur="6.76">potentially about to become liabilities</text>
  <text start="264.35" dur="7.26">so they&amp;#39;re either gonna have to flip and</text>
  <text start="268.43" dur="4.98">and pray for safety and basically try to</text>
  <text start="271.61" dur="4.68">do something really big for the good</text>
  <text start="273.41" dur="6.03">guys to save themselves or their</text>
  <text start="276.29" dur="5.25">possibly about to be taken out or maybe</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="4.53">being a loose end or witness to someone</text>
  <text start="281.54" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s higher up the food chain because</text>
  <text start="283.97" dur="3.36">now there&amp;#39;ll be a liability because now</text>
  <text start="285.92" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re linked that could tie back to</text>
  <text start="287.33" dur="3.63">someone else and you know they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="289.4" dur="4.95">going to just leave it to chance or</text>
  <text start="290.96" dur="6.06">trust so six o&amp;#39;clock can be dangerous</text>
  <text start="294.35" dur="5.01">now six o&amp;#39;clock I am assuming in this</text>
  <text start="297.02" dur="5.49">point is a reference to behind you right</text>
  <text start="299.36" dur="8.22">so someone behind you can be dangerous</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="7.05">but also family proud and that has a lot</text>
  <text start="307.58" dur="4.08">of meanings to it in this context I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="309.56" dur="3.96">not even gonna try to dive into them it</text>
  <text start="311.66" dur="4.26">could be a family you know a specific</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="5.7">family or it could just be a way to</text>
  <text start="315.92" dur="7.59">shame this specific candidate probably</text>
  <text start="319.22" dur="6.24">even Co me so 36-hundred we have for</text>
  <text start="323.51" dur="5.45">those who decide to save the taxpayers</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="7.71">some money there is no escaping God now</text>
  <text start="328.96" dur="6.28">this idiot Mike Rothschild supposedly no</text>
  <text start="333.17" dur="4.89">relation to the rail rush trials I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="335.24" dur="5.25">think they don&amp;#39;t him if he was or claim</text>
  <text start="338.06" dur="4.38">him at least so this is straight up</text>
  <text start="340.49" dur="3.21">queueing on asking followers to carry</text>
  <text start="342.44" dur="4.8">out violent acts in lieu of</text>
  <text start="343.7" dur="5.38">taxpayer-funded executions so incredibly</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="5.23">dangerous</text>
  <text start="349.08" dur="5.61">if you&amp;#39;ve read that and you understand</text>
  <text start="352.47" dur="4.14">English and logic then the only way that</text>
  <text start="354.69" dur="3.99">you could assume that that was queueing</text>
  <text start="356.61" dur="4.38">on asking his followers to commit</text>
  <text start="358.68" dur="6.06">violence is if you think God is one of</text>
  <text start="360.99" dur="7.109">his followers anyway I&amp;#39;ll leave it at</text>
  <text start="364.74" dur="6.06">that you know maybe you do and maybe God</text>
  <text start="368.099" dur="5.16">will commit violence on our behalf and</text>
  <text start="370.8" dur="4.38">strike down some you know some</text>
  <text start="373.259" dur="5.581">blasphemers and pedophiles and some</text>
  <text start="375.18" dur="6.449">traitors but in the actual literal of</text>
  <text start="378.84" dur="4.41">what was said here I think it&amp;#39;s quite</text>
  <text start="381.629" dur="5.701">clear that no violence was being called</text>
  <text start="383.25" dur="6.3">for Mycroft&amp;#39;s child and I can&amp;#39;t respond</text>
  <text start="387.33" dur="4.589">because look I&amp;#39;m still I can&amp;#39;t even like</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="5.64">it watch if I try to like the crap it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="391.919" dur="4.53">I&amp;#39;m still banned I&amp;#39;m still suspended not</text>
  <text start="395.19" dur="6.12">that I would like it anyway</text>
  <text start="396.449" dur="6.481">so clearly not violence and they keep</text>
  <text start="401.31" dur="4.289">trying and they keep trying as though if</text>
  <text start="402.93" dur="4.62">they say it it will become reality and I</text>
  <text start="405.599" dur="4.47">guess if they bit burn us off the</text>
  <text start="407.55" dur="4.35">internet it will write they&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="410.069" dur="3.6">to get away with the things like that it</text>
  <text start="411.9" dur="5.37">will become part of the public record</text>
  <text start="413.669" dur="5.851">the official narrative and they&amp;#39;ll own</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="6.269">the story again and that&amp;#39;s not good for</text>
  <text start="419.52" dur="9.019">anyone so 3601 we have a twitter message</text>
  <text start="423.539" dur="8.97">from Lessie conservative MA all right</text>

  <text start="440.969" dur="4.621">and he just kind of nods an agreement</text>
