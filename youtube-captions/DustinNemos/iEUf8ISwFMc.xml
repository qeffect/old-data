  <text start="165.47" dur="3.66">personal experience and all most of us</text>
  <text start="167" dur="3.78">you can&amp;#39;t really you know you can</text>
  <text start="169.13" dur="3">convince some of the left perhaps of</text>
  <text start="170.78" dur="3.03">those talking points but you can</text>
  <text start="172.13" dur="3.99">convince people that have been through</text>
  <text start="173.81" dur="4.23">it and felt it and and have been</text>
  <text start="176.12" dur="3.21">censored themselves on such a massive</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="3.12">scale that you know you don&amp;#39;t even have</text>
  <text start="179.33" dur="3.63">to be a youtuber or a journalist or a</text>
  <text start="181.16" dur="3.21">public figure you can just be a regular</text>
  <text start="182.96" dur="4.41">person sharing a picture of our</text>
  <text start="184.37" dur="4.89">president and you can get the ban hammer</text>
  <text start="187.37" dur="3.96">or the censored hammer or whatever you</text>
  <text start="189.26" dur="4.14">want to call it shadow bandi boosting</text>
  <text start="191.33" dur="5.04">demonetised you know deep platforming</text>
  <text start="193.4" dur="5.58">band all of it now we also have and then</text>
  <text start="196.37" dur="4.05">you know the this is this is gossip</text>
  <text start="198.98" dur="3.54">rumor kind of stuff I don&amp;#39;t usually</text>
  <text start="200.42" dur="4.95">cover it but it is interesting to see</text>
  <text start="202.52" dur="5.46">that a Democrat Congress woman on the</text>
  <text start="205.37" dur="6.71">Democrat side was engaged in some sort</text>

  <text start="212.08" dur="5.11">relationship in the office and now these</text>
  <text start="214.34" dur="6.24">photos that leaked out you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.19" dur="4.65">just like it&amp;#39;s more drama on the left it</text>
  <text start="220.58" dur="2.79">doesn&amp;#39;t look good but it showed it</text>
  <text start="221.84" dur="3.06">highlights the double standard if this</text>
  <text start="223.37" dur="2.97">had been a Republican or something it</text>
  <text start="224.9" dur="2.52">would have been going on for weeks they</text>
  <text start="226.34" dur="3.45">would have had to step down everything</text>
  <text start="227.42" dur="5.37">else and I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="229.79" dur="5.75">happen here maybe they won&amp;#39;t you know be</text>
  <text start="232.79" dur="5.19">elected again but you know we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="235.54" dur="4.479">probably won&amp;#39;t bother their constituents</text>
  <text start="237.98" dur="4.05">a bit probably get a more but more votes</text>
  <text start="240.019" dur="5.671">if anything also we have Trump</text>
  <text start="242.03" dur="6.39">campaigning to or the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="245.69" dur="5.28">vowing to sue CNN for bias after Project</text>
  <text start="248.42" dur="5.18">Veritas latest leaks as you know project</text>

  <text start="257.109" dur="4.931">including things where employees</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="4.38">admitted to hating Trump and being</text>
  <text start="262.04" dur="5.07">racist on some levels against whites and</text>
  <text start="264.32" dur="4.71">talking about how suckers is anti Trump</text>
  <text start="267.11" dur="4.11">and hates Trump and how the the</text>
  <text start="269.03" dur="4.92">organization is left-leaning and doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="271.22" dur="4.53">admit it and how it&amp;#39;s all just Trump</text>
  <text start="273.95" dur="3.75">Trump Trump and they hate Trump and</text>
  <text start="275.75" dur="4.2">everything else how they they kind of</text>
  <text start="277.7" dur="4.05">are supporting Warren right now and not</text>
  <text start="279.95" dur="4.19">bitin I mean it they&amp;#39;re trying to play</text>
  <text start="281.75" dur="4.83">kingmaker in that sense so this is a</text>
  <text start="284.14" dur="4.81">sort of fake news you get right this is</text>
  <text start="286.58" dur="4.2">what&amp;#39;s happening behind the scenes and I</text>
  <text start="288.95" dur="2.33">hope he does sue them now speaking of</text>
  <text start="290.78" dur="2.48">fake</text>
  <text start="291.28" dur="5.48">what&amp;#39;s going on behind the scenes we</text>
  <text start="293.26" dur="7.32">also have the MSNBC president apparently</text>
  <text start="296.76" dur="5.62">waving a zoomed-in photo of Maria and</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="4.589">the new news and I&amp;#39;m not probably saying</text>
  <text start="302.38" dur="6.27">that right vagina at a staff meeting now</text>
  <text start="305.169" dur="5.881">look this is her beautiful woman yeah</text>
  <text start="308.65" dur="4.2">but why would you do that at a staff why</text>
  <text start="311.05" dur="4.619">would you do that in any company at all</text>
  <text start="312.85" dur="4.68">like even him in like even with your</text>
  <text start="315.669" dur="4.681">hanging out with the guys drunk at a bar</text>
  <text start="317.53" dur="6.72">that&amp;#39;s still kind of inappropriate and</text>
  <text start="320.35" dur="6.15">gross in sort of a low-class I think</text>
  <text start="324.25" dur="6.77">anyway so apparently he had gotten ahold</text>
  <text start="326.5" dur="7.86">of this photo because someone had a</text>
  <text start="331.02" dur="5.44">zoomed in picture of her having a</text>
  <text start="334.36" dur="6.09">wardrobe malfunction while wearing a</text>
  <text start="336.46" dur="6.209">bikini in public and he had been he had</text>
  <text start="340.45" dur="4.91">zoomed in on it and then he says that</text>
  <text start="342.669" dur="6.601">apparently according allegations here</text>
  <text start="345.36" dur="8.86">would you look at that as he exhaled</text>
  <text start="349.27" dur="6.84">hard he says not bad not bad so look</text>
  <text start="354.22" dur="6.27">that&amp;#39;s gross and Phil Griffin the head</text>
  <text start="356.11" dur="6.09">of MSNBC is anyway that&amp;#39;s just gross I</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="2.94">don&amp;#39;t know this is the kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="362.2" dur="3.57">that we&amp;#39;re dealing with from fake news</text>
  <text start="363.43" dur="5.549">this is what happens when you give some</text>
  <text start="365.77" dur="4.649">people that just really any people too</text>
  <text start="368.979" dur="3.391">much money too much power</text>
  <text start="370.419" dur="4.201">but as eventually even the best ones</text>
  <text start="372.37" dur="3.81">will be corrupted by it so money and</text>
  <text start="374.62" dur="3.69">power in the hands of the few like this</text>
  <text start="376.18" dur="4.14">is a big big deal that&amp;#39;s why we need new</text>
  <text start="378.31" dur="4.44">media to challenge these guys they have</text>
  <text start="380.32" dur="5.37">had it for too long too good and too</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="4.41">corrupt and obviously they&amp;#39;re just a</text>
  <text start="385.69" dur="3.63">bunch of sex perverts selling out</text>
  <text start="387.16" dur="2.94">propaganda for political power</text>

  <text start="393.61" dur="4.65">not about race or or sex or any of that</text>
  <text start="396.85" dur="3.83">other nonsense that&amp;#39;s what they used to</text>
  <text start="398.26" dur="4.83">divide us it&amp;#39;s about this political</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="5.34">parasitical class that thinks that they</text>
  <text start="403.09" dur="5.34">can just abuse exploit and lie to us and</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="5.2">engage in debauchery all day long and</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="5.22">immorality and these things have a price</text>
  <text start="411.22" dur="4.23">to pay for society gender neutral</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="3.69">restrooms in the UK schools reportedly</text>

  <text start="423.199" dur="3.09">gonna be a bad idea and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="3.45">obviously some of the consequences where</text>
  <text start="426.289" dur="4.59">we have perverted men pretending to be</text>
  <text start="428" dur="5.909">women and then spying on girls and women</text>
  <text start="430.879" dur="6.84">in restrooms we even had sexual assaults</text>

  <text start="458.87" dur="4.919">into and obviously there are a price</text>
  <text start="461.599" dur="4.591">there are prices to pay when you avoid</text>
  <text start="463.789" dur="4.951">reality and when you force things on</text>
  <text start="466.19" dur="5.43">people like that there&amp;#39;s always a price</text>
  <text start="468.74" dur="4.35">to pay for distortion yeah economically</text>
