  <text start="98.49" dur="3.839">this because it&amp;#39;s important you guys</text>
  <text start="100.71" dur="2.97">know that my position has been for a</text>
  <text start="102.329" dur="3.121">very long time that we are in and</text>
  <text start="103.68" dur="3.66">everything bubble we&amp;#39;re in trouble and</text>
  <text start="105.45" dur="4.05">the economy is going to crash at some</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="4.169">point in fact it&amp;#39;s going to not only</text>
  <text start="109.5" dur="3.42">crash but possibly collapse we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="3.661">we&amp;#39;re going we&amp;#39;re looking at a paradigm</text>
  <text start="112.92" dur="5.879">change we&amp;#39;re looking at in our lifetimes</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="5.129">the death of the US dollar because it is</text>
  <text start="118.799" dur="3.151">dying already very quickly other</text>
  <text start="120.299" dur="4.651">countries or abandoning at other central</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="4.919">banks are abandoning it and it looks</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="3.86">like the trade war itself was one of the</text>
  <text start="126.869" dur="5.581">few things that was actually ironically</text>
  <text start="128.81" dur="5.2">keeping things going so President Trump</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="2.849">every time he would tweet out that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="134.01" dur="3.75">getting close to making a trade deal</text>
  <text start="135.299" dur="4.861">happen a huge bump for the stock market</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="4.35">now it looks like right after it at</text>
  <text start="140.16" dur="4.59">least phase one of the trade deal</text>
  <text start="142.11" dur="5.239">happened and it was agreed to things</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="5.25">started to tank pretty quickly and then</text>
  <text start="147.349" dur="5.711">President Trump announces phase two of</text>
  <text start="150" dur="4.56">the trade boy so listen president Rome</text>
  <text start="153.06" dur="4.41">knows what he&amp;#39;s doing and he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="154.56" dur="5.04">do the best he can as an expert captain</text>
  <text start="157.47" dur="4.32">landing a burning plane that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="159.6" dur="3.96">what this economy is it&amp;#39;s not his fault</text>
  <text start="161.79" dur="4.08">he&amp;#39;s gonna do what he can for it I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="163.56" dur="4.35">hold any of the blame for him all of</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="5.19">these were problems built up over the</text>
  <text start="167.91" dur="4.859">last hundred years of corruption and you</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="3.209">know these are things that were gonna</text>
  <text start="172.769" dur="2.851">have to go through the prices that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="174.269" dur="4.911">gonna have to pay for this corruption</text>
  <text start="175.62" dur="7.47">and that that&amp;#39;s a price paid for in</text>
  <text start="179.18" dur="6.22">human suffering and and human people in</text>
  <text start="183.09" dur="5.16">America going without and even possibly</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="4.23">poverty it&amp;#39;s not gonna be fun I do think</text>
  <text start="188.25" dur="3.389">it&amp;#39;s gonna be necessary at like I think</text>
  <text start="189.63" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s gonna be good for us to learn some</text>
  <text start="191.639" dur="4.051">of these hard economic lessons and maybe</text>
  <text start="193.92" dur="5.43">we won&amp;#39;t be so quick to abandon the</text>
  <text start="195.69" dur="5.329">dollar next time but at least in the</text>
  <text start="199.35" dur="3.78">meantime I want everybody you know just</text>
  <text start="201.019" dur="3.97">always be prepared for anything</text>
  <text start="203.13" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t just think that the economy</text>
  <text start="204.989" dur="4.08">is going great because that&amp;#39;s what you</text>
  <text start="207.42" dur="3.48">hear on the headlines you you&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="209.069" dur="3.57">a record new highs all the time because</text>
  <text start="210.9" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s in a bubble the everything level</text>
  <text start="212.639" dur="4.591">and that&amp;#39;s what happens in bubbles of</text>
  <text start="216.06" dur="2.79">course compared to some of the other</text>
  <text start="217.23" dur="3.36">countries out there right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="218.85" dur="4.62">probably still one of the stronger of</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="4.47">the dying fiat currencies out there you</text>
  <text start="223.47" dur="3.269">know that the dollar is still stronger</text>
  <text start="225.06" dur="2.58">than a lot of the other ones is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="226.739" dur="2.821">all doing the same</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re all collapsing and they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="229.56" dur="5.3">mass money-printing while at the same</text>
  <text start="232.17" dur="6.48">time and this is important to remember</text>
  <text start="234.86" dur="5.95">gold and some cash are disappearing all</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="4.74">over the world it&amp;#39;s just billions and</text>
  <text start="240.81" dur="4.56">billions of dollars of gold in and cash</text>
  <text start="243.39" dur="4.2">just disappearing people are stocking it</text>
  <text start="245.37" dur="3.99">up almost as though the very wealthy</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="4.41">just decided to start shoving it in</text>
  <text start="249.36" dur="5.93">their mattress and and stocking it away</text>
  <text start="252" dur="5.79">for a hard day you know so makes</text>
  <text start="255.29" dur="4.03">absolute sense as well to do that and if</text>
  <text start="257.79" dur="2.49">you&amp;#39;re not doing that then it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="2.849">chance to start</text>
  <text start="260.28" dur="4.02">not that I expect anybody here to be</text>
  <text start="262.169" dur="4.651">buying gold but you know it&amp;#39;s over or</text>
  <text start="264.3" dur="4.11">sorrell food or whatever else may happen</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="4.17">I mean many people don&amp;#39;t know this but</text>
  <text start="268.41" dur="6.03">we&amp;#39;re entering if not already in a grand</text>
  <text start="270.99" dur="4.86">solar minimum so you know that that plan</text>
  <text start="274.44" dur="2.79">and maybe this is part of the plan I</text>
  <text start="275.85" dur="2.46">don&amp;#39;t know but the plan of telling</text>
  <text start="277.23" dur="2.67">everybody that the world is getting</text>
  <text start="278.31" dur="2.3">hotter and hotter and everything&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="279.9" dur="3.06">get worse</text>
  <text start="280.61" dur="4.57">seems to peak out as actually getting</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="4.41">colder around 2030 with the grand solar</text>
  <text start="285.18" dur="3.96">minimum and last time a grand solar</text>
  <text start="287.37" dur="4.41">minimum happened there was mass</text>
  <text start="289.14" dur="5.88">starvation okay there was mass food</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="4.949">starvation because the crops started to</text>
  <text start="295.02" dur="4.26">die and mass they couldn&amp;#39;t grow nearly</text>
  <text start="296.729" dur="5.731">as much food in fact one or two degrees</text>
  <text start="299.28" dur="6.06">if temperature loss is there like 40</text>
  <text start="302.46" dur="6.09">days of loss from your growing season so</text>
  <text start="305.34" dur="6.57">you know crops start to fail food starts</text>
  <text start="308.55" dur="5.94">to be scarce and as you and I already</text>
  <text start="311.91" dur="5.04">know the shelves will be emptied very</text>
  <text start="314.49" dur="7.82">quickly during any emergency so what</text>
  <text start="316.95" dur="9">happens what happens when 2030 hits and</text>
  <text start="322.31" dur="5.47">some of the or even sooner prices are</text>
  <text start="325.95" dur="4.469">already soaring through the roof in fact</text>
  <text start="327.78" dur="4.98">for food but what happens when the the</text>
  <text start="330.419" dur="4.471">breaking point hits and now everybody</text>
  <text start="332.76" dur="4.59">realizes oh wow food is a scarce thing</text>
  <text start="334.89" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s not always gonna be there it may</text>
  <text start="337.35" dur="3.78">not be on the shelves when I need it</text>
  <text start="338.76" dur="4.2">maybe I should have a supply so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.13" dur="4.56">gonna be where everyone suddenly becomes</text>
  <text start="342.96" dur="4.829">a prepper and it&amp;#39;s hard to get food now</text>
  <text start="345.69" dur="4.14">my personal plan especially given the</text>
  <text start="347.789" dur="4.351">fact that prices of meat are rising more</text>
  <text start="349.83" dur="5.07">and more and more is to is to start</text>
  <text start="352.14" dur="4.35">storing some pemmican which is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="354.9" dur="3.51">because I&amp;#39;m cheap and I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="356.49" dur="3.299">buy it and I do want to buy some</text>
  <text start="358.41" dur="2.49">storable food it&amp;#39;s because I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="359.789" dur="3.151">afford enough and I want</text>
  <text start="360.9" dur="5.73">start stocking some things away so</text>
  <text start="362.94" dur="6.18">pemmican is an old recipe for a type of</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s like a meat bar or something I</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t know how to describe it</text>
  <text start="370.35" dur="4.89">they take the fat out of the meat they</text>
  <text start="372.75" dur="5.52">melt that down they take the meat itself</text>
  <text start="375.24" dur="4.83">and cook it or dehydrated or dry it in</text>
  <text start="378.27" dur="4.29">some way and then powder it up I believe</text>
  <text start="380.07" dur="3.9">and then they add in whatever flavorings</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="3.359">like salt and fruit and things like that</text>
  <text start="383.97" dur="4.199">dried fruit and then they mix it back</text>
  <text start="385.919" dur="3.631">together now I&amp;#39;m still I&amp;#39;m not looking</text>
  <text start="388.169" dur="3.12">at the recipe list in front of me and</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="3.75">I&amp;#39;ve never done it yet because it takes</text>
  <text start="391.289" dur="4.35">a lot of time but I want to start making</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="3.96">pen again because it will last for a 15</text>
  <text start="395.639" dur="4.711">maybe even a hundred years in some cases</text>
  <text start="397.26" dur="6.629">and even though a grand solar minimum</text>
  <text start="400.35" dur="5.46">could be 50 years of of or almost 50</text>
  <text start="403.889" dur="4.621">years of a low food period for our</text>
  <text start="405.81" dur="4.35">entire planet especially up in length in</text>
  <text start="408.51" dur="3.51">northern northern northern areas where</text>
  <text start="410.16" dur="3.27">it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s already very very</text>
  <text start="412.02" dur="3.3">very cold and you can barely grow</text>
  <text start="413.43" dur="3.54">anything like I used to be in New</text>
  <text start="415.32" dur="5.909">Hampshire six feet of snow up in North</text>
  <text start="416.97" dur="5.789">Country when that happens it&amp;#39;s gonna get</text>
  <text start="421.229" dur="4.531">really bad for people that didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="422.759" dur="4.741">some storable food you know and pemmican</text>
  <text start="425.76" dur="3.48">is a super food basically because you</text>
  <text start="427.5" dur="3.96">get all of the healthy fats you get all</text>
  <text start="429.24" dur="4.95">of the healthy meat and things that have</text>
  <text start="431.46" dur="5.22">high quality you know calories in it and</text>
  <text start="434.19" dur="4.229">high high density of nutrition like the</text>
  <text start="436.68" dur="4.2">fat has a lot more density of energy</text>
  <text start="438.419" dur="5.041">then like a vegetable for example you</text>
  <text start="440.88" dur="4.65">need both but fats that&amp;#39;s why ketosis or</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="4.98">ketogenic diet is so good because people</text>
  <text start="445.53" dur="4.53">want to burn the fat for energy so if</text>
  <text start="448.44" dur="3.78">you&amp;#39;re in a starvation situation and</text>
  <text start="450.06" dur="4.05">everyone else is freaking out you could</text>
  <text start="452.22" dur="4.74">have a whole case of pemmican somewhere</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="4.5">anyway that&amp;#39;s my thought and that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="456.96" dur="4.29">move on from the economy now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="4.26">want everybody to get scared I think</text>
  <text start="461.25" dur="3.09">it&amp;#39;s just gonna be a hard time I think</text>
  <text start="462.87" dur="3.359">it&amp;#39;s gonna be a hard time that we have</text>
  <text start="464.34" dur="3.389">to to go through like a credit card</text>
  <text start="466.229" dur="3.451">junkie that just can&amp;#39;t get off the</text>
  <text start="467.729" dur="3.87">credit cards and we&amp;#39;re gonna learn about</text>
  <text start="469.68" dur="7.32">easy debt and hard lives in our</text>
  <text start="471.599" dur="10.281">decisions now that said moving on more</text>
  <text start="477" dur="8.34">Trump Ninth Circuit appointees confirmed</text>
  <text start="481.88" dur="6.219">it&amp;#39;s too much winning we can&amp;#39;t take it</text>
  <text start="485.34" dur="4.319">so the Ninth Circuit is very important</text>
  <text start="488.099" dur="3.721">this is where a lot of the decisions go</text>
  <text start="489.659" dur="4.571">to be made because of course they get</text>
  <text start="491.82" dur="7.42">appealed and the Ninth Circuit has been</text>
  <text start="494.23" dur="6.24">a leftist you know factory of bad law</text>
  <text start="499.24" dur="2.37">for quite a while and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="500.47" dur="3.18">churning it out because they were</text>
  <text start="501.61" dur="4.11">politically dominated now we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="503.65" dur="5.31">see how that works for conservatives</text>
  <text start="505.72" dur="5.25">look frankly we always say these are</text>
  <text start="508.96" dur="4.41">fair rule of law conservative judges</text>
  <text start="510.97" dur="4.08">that are constitutionalist and I believe</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="3.51">that&amp;#39;s what Trump is appointing however</text>
  <text start="515.05" dur="3.24">if they get in there and they start</text>
  <text start="516.88" dur="3.349">playing sides and they start you know</text>
  <text start="518.29" dur="4.47">banning abortion and things like that</text>
  <text start="520.229" dur="4.831">I&amp;#39;m not gonna complain too much you know</text>
  <text start="522.76" dur="4.59">because the left only understands force</text>
  <text start="525.06" dur="3.79">one example being how they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="3.17">get the National Guard and Virginia to</text>
  <text start="528.85" dur="4.14">go confiscate people&amp;#39;s guns</text>
  <text start="530.52" dur="4.42">unconstitutionally because people won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="532.99" dur="3.45">give them up and their sanctuary cities</text>
  <text start="534.94" dur="5.04">and stuff popping up for Second</text>
  <text start="536.44" dur="5.37">Amendment now in Virginia so you know if</text>

  <text start="894.16" dur="3.449">happened yet</text>
  <text start="894.819" dur="4.92">I&amp;#39;m saying that as people start to die</text>

  <text start="899.739" dur="4.14">like Arkansas or something of that</text>
  <text start="901.179" dur="4.77">nature in a public spectacle on these</text>
  <text start="903.879" dur="4.17">high-profile cases like the Epstein</text>
  <text start="905.949" dur="3.57">situation everyone is now making a joke</text>

  <text start="911.619" dur="3.541">is everywhere everyone gets it everyone</text>
  <text start="913.059" dur="5.58">laughs about it I did a Q speech</text>
  <text start="915.16" dur="6.029">recently nearby in Florida and you know</text>
  <text start="918.639" dur="5.55">was emotionally overcrowded 50s and 60s</text>

  <text start="936.1" dur="4.169">now and that&amp;#39;s a beautiful thing to see</text>
  <text start="938.35" dur="3.959">so that&amp;#39;s exactly what will happen I</text>
  <text start="940.269" dur="4.26">think if we start to see someone</text>
  <text start="942.309" dur="4.26">disappear in these high-profile cases</text>

  <text start="1474.91" dur="4.2">shield even though he&amp;#39;s no longer there</text>
  <text start="1476.44" dur="5.91">now beyond that of course he made</text>
  <text start="1479.11" dur="4.8">numerous statements it seems like it was</text>
  <text start="1482.35" dur="2.94">a recurring theme with some of his</text>
  <text start="1483.91" dur="3.57">answers as though he was trying to bring</text>
  <text start="1485.29" dur="5.16">attention to it and that was systemic</text>
  <text start="1487.48" dur="5.46">issues within the FBI now briefly let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1490.45" dur="4.89">explain what and why that&amp;#39;s a big big</text>
  <text start="1492.94" dur="5.46">deal let me go big here go big or go</text>
  <text start="1495.34" dur="6.84">home right so systemic issues within the</text>
  <text start="1498.4" dur="5.94">FBI or the DOJ or or any of these groups</text>
  <text start="1502.18" dur="3.93">of people that you know go after and and</text>
  <text start="1504.34" dur="4.17">charge people and put them in jail or</text>
  <text start="1506.11" dur="5.46">create big laws or precedents or</text>
  <text start="1508.51" dur="4.8">situations within our legal system what</text>
  <text start="1511.57" dur="5.97">happens if one of them was proven to be</text>
  <text start="1513.31" dur="5.94">bad or dishonest or setting people up</text>
  <text start="1517.54" dur="3.18">right this happens sometimes on lower</text>
  <text start="1519.25" dur="3.18">levels where you find that the DA&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1520.72" dur="3.51">office has been breaking the law for 20</text>
  <text start="1522.43" dur="4.68">years and setting people up sent way</text>
  <text start="1524.23" dur="4.26">thousands of people right unfairly and</text>

  <text start="1528.49" dur="2.79">shouldn&amp;#39;t have done and things like that</text>
  <text start="1529.33" dur="7.49">so the power of being a prosecutor it is</text>
  <text start="1531.28" dur="8.07">immense but on the other hand when they</text>
  <text start="1536.82" dur="6.93">do find something like this and they try</text>
  <text start="1539.35" dur="7.95">to go through and fix it it is like</text>
  <text start="1543.75" dur="5.47">untangling the worst fishing line or</text>

  <text start="1570.19" dur="3.87">likely to happen much less is it</text>
  <text start="1571.75" dur="4.38">practical or pragmatic it&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="1574.06" dur="4.5">impossible right it would require the</text>
  <text start="1576.13" dur="4.179">kind of unity to do that but well we</text>
  <text start="1578.56" dur="3.58">won&amp;#39;t have in this count</text>
  <text start="1580.309" dur="3.721">or it would require to just go back and</text>

  <text start="1588.02" dur="4.35">call me is is saying here with the word</text>
  <text start="1589.88" dur="4.44">systemic and and he uses this this a lot</text>
  <text start="1592.37" dur="3.539">you know he&amp;#39;s more like well it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1594.32" dur="3.51">I&amp;#39;m not concerned about this case I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1595.909" dur="5.041">more worried about is this systemic is</text>
  <text start="1597.83" dur="4.32">this systemic and if you watch that clip</text>
  <text start="1600.95" dur="3.45">I think you&amp;#39;ll come out of it with the</text>

  <text start="1605.96" dur="4.17">if you&amp;#39;re looking for the way he phrases</text>
  <text start="1607.22" dur="5.55">the issue of being systemic I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1610.13" dur="4.47">a threat I think it is the way Calton</text>
  <text start="1612.77" dur="3.93">McCabe said he&amp;#39;ll take everybody down</text>
  <text start="1614.6" dur="3.93">with him you know so what what call me</text>
  <text start="1616.7" dur="4.62">is saying here is you can&amp;#39;t take me down</text>
  <text start="1618.53" dur="5.639">if you take me down everything I did as</text>
  <text start="1621.32" dur="5.52">director of the FBI is now in question</text>
  <text start="1624.169" dur="5.13">how much of what I did is systemic how</text>
  <text start="1626.84" dur="3.9">much of all of the systemic problem out</text>
  <text start="1629.299" dur="4.921">there and the other people in the system</text>
  <text start="1630.74" dur="5.25">how much of that systemic problem is</text>
  <text start="1634.22" dur="3.36">still out there and how much of that can</text>
  <text start="1635.99" dur="3.21">you deal with so he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="1637.58" dur="3.839">basically threaten and saying if you</text>
  <text start="1639.2" dur="4.26">take me down I will not only take down</text>
  <text start="1641.419" dur="5.13">other people with me but I will expose</text>
  <text start="1643.46" dur="4.89">this system as as being corrupt I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1646.549" dur="3.63">bring down the institution with me</text>
  <text start="1648.35" dur="4.439">that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s trying to say at least</text>

  <text start="1654.62" dur="8.49">the word so often that you know systemic</text>
  <text start="1659.24" dur="6.21">systemic systemic anyway so he does that</text>
  <text start="1663.11" dur="6.059">kind of false embrace of an apology as</text>
  <text start="1665.45" dur="5.52">well he&amp;#39;s he was right I was wrong I was</text>
  <text start="1669.169" dur="3.571">overconfident as director in our</text>
  <text start="1670.97" dur="4.92">procedures and what happened was not</text>
  <text start="1672.74" dur="4.89">acceptable okay sure that those are fine</text>
  <text start="1675.89" dur="2.84">things to say except for your you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1681.409" dur="4.681">you&amp;#39;re still trying to claim</text>
  <text start="1683.809" dur="4.201">incompetence on the level of some he</text>
  <text start="1686.09" dur="3.03">said seven levels deep in the FBI is oh</text>
  <text start="1688.01" dur="4.98">he had nothing to do with the case</text>
  <text start="1689.12" dur="7.71">things like that now continuing on we</text>
  <text start="1692.99" dur="5.549">also have this case we have Schiff who</text>
  <text start="1696.83" dur="4.26">again is under the hot seat a lot of</text>
  <text start="1698.539" dur="6.14">people are him for the lies he said as</text>
  <text start="1701.09" dur="5.67">well and here he is defending himself</text>
  <text start="1704.679" dur="3.461">report because you have weighed in on</text>
  <text start="1706.76" dur="3.6">that and 2018</text>
  <text start="1708.14" dur="3.04">you were the ranking member the top</text>
  <text start="1710.36" dur="2.44">Democrat</text>
  <text start="1711.18" dur="3.75">the minority in the Intelligence</text>
  <text start="1712.8" dur="4.59">Committee Devin Nunez the then</text>
  <text start="1714.93" dur="4.56">Republican chair issued a report talking</text>
  <text start="1717.39" dur="5.37">about all the problems with the FISA</text>
  <text start="1719.49" dur="6.39">warrants in the FBI case you defended</text>
  <text start="1722.76" dur="5.13">the FBI&amp;#39;s use of FISA warrants to</text>
  <text start="1725.88" dur="5.16">surveil Carter page in a lengthy memo</text>
  <text start="1727.89" dur="4.89">here you are discussing that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1731.04" dur="4.08">important for the public to see the</text>
  <text start="1732.78" dur="4.29">facts that the FBI acted appropriately</text>
  <text start="1735.12" dur="4.26">in seeking a warrant and Carter page</text>
  <text start="1737.07" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re not part of some deep State as</text>
  <text start="1739.38" dur="4.83">the president apparently would like the</text>
  <text start="1741.12" dur="7.92">public to believe after reading the AG&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1744.21" dur="7.95">report which discusses 17 serious errors</text>
  <text start="1749.04" dur="5.28">of omission some would say misconduct on</text>
  <text start="1752.16" dur="4.95">the part of the FBI do you still think</text>
  <text start="1754.32" dur="6.06">that the FBI acted appropriately as you</text>
  <text start="1757.11" dur="5.19">said there well I think this is</text>
  <text start="1760.38" dur="4.11">consistent with the IG report that they</text>
  <text start="1762.3" dur="4.08">were right to seek a FISA on Carter page</text>
  <text start="1764.49" dur="4.77">and there wasn&amp;#39;t some deep state</text>
  <text start="1766.38" dur="5.64">conspiracy there was no spying on the</text>
  <text start="1769.26" dur="5.28">Trump campaign there was no effort -</text>
  <text start="1772.02" dur="4.29">based on political bias open the</text>
  <text start="1774.54" dur="3.84">investigation was properly predicated</text>
  <text start="1776.31" dur="4.89">but there were nonetheless serious</text>
  <text start="1778.38" dur="4.5">abuses of FISA which were not apparent</text>
  <text start="1781.2" dur="4.83">two years ago but which have become</text>
  <text start="1782.88" dur="4.38">apparent now with 170 witnesses</text>
  <text start="1786.03" dur="4.23">interviewed and two million-dollar</text>
  <text start="1787.26" dur="4.29">documents reviewed by the IG and I am</text>
  <text start="1790.26" dur="2.97">glad that the IG made the</text>
  <text start="1791.55" dur="3.69">recommendations that he has made and the</text>
  <text start="1793.23" dur="5.01">FBI is going to follow them but that</text>
  <text start="1795.24" dur="5.21">wasn&amp;#39;t apparent to us two years ago but</text>
  <text start="1798.24" dur="4.68">the most significant things I think or</text>
  <text start="1800.45" dur="4.63">that corrective steps will be taken in</text>
  <text start="1802.92" dur="4.02">terms of the FISA process and that the</text>
  <text start="1805.08" dur="3.87">IG debunked these claims by the</text>
  <text start="1806.94" dur="5.43">president by mr. Nunez and others of</text>
  <text start="1808.95" dur="4.77">this deep state conspiracy this improper</text>
  <text start="1812.37" dur="3">investigation that would have been</text>
  <text start="1813.72" dur="4.35">negligent for them not to conduct this</text>
  <text start="1815.37" dur="4.98">investigation I&amp;#39;ve just got a minute</text>
  <text start="1818.07" dur="5.01">left because at that time in 2018 you</text>
  <text start="1820.35" dur="7.55">said the FBI and Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="1823.08" dur="6.9">did not quote omit material information</text>
  <text start="1827.9" dur="4.24">apparently you did not know at the time</text>
  <text start="1829.98" dur="4.29">that in fact Steele&amp;#39;s main Russian</text>
  <text start="1832.14" dur="4.32">sources had told the FBI that he had</text>
  <text start="1834.27" dur="4.77">misrepresented what that Russian source</text>
  <text start="1836.46" dur="5.13">had said and that the FBI knew at the</text>
  <text start="1839.04" dur="5.4">time the Carter page in fact was acting</text>
  <text start="1841.59" dur="3">as a contact as a unofficial source for</text>
  <text start="1844.44" dur="4.17">the</text>
  <text start="1844.59" dur="6.75">CIA given what you know now we talked</text>
  <text start="1848.61" dur="4.89">earlier to director Comey and he</text>
  <text start="1851.34" dur="4.68">basically said I was wrong in what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1853.5" dur="4.409">represented back in 2018 are you willing</text>
  <text start="1856.02" dur="6.149">to admit that you were wrong in your</text>
  <text start="1857.909" dur="6.541">defense of the FBI&amp;#39;s FISA process I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1862.169" dur="4.051">certainly willing to admit that the</text>
  <text start="1864.45" dur="4.109">Inspector General found serious abuses</text>
  <text start="1866.22" dur="4.29">of FISA that I was unaware of had I</text>
  <text start="1868.559" dur="4.771">known of them Chris yes I would have</text>
  <text start="1870.51" dur="4.83">called out the FBI at the same time but</text>
  <text start="1873.33" dur="3.54">I think it&amp;#39;s only fair to judge what we</text>
  <text start="1875.34" dur="3.809">knew at the time not what would be</text>
  <text start="1876.87" dur="3.96">revealed two years later but yes there</text>
  <text start="1879.149" dur="3.871">were very serious abuses of the FISA</text>
  <text start="1880.83" dur="3.329">process they need to be corrected we</text>
  <text start="1883.02" dur="4.769">need to make sure they never happened</text>
  <text start="1884.159" dur="5.971">again and continuing on I hope you guys</text>
  <text start="1887.789" dur="4.831">enjoy that shift being a liar that he is</text>
  <text start="1890.13" dur="5.669">we also have a quote from President</text>
  <text start="1892.62" dur="5.57">Trump saying Obama knew everything as he</text>
  <text start="1895.799" dur="6.141">goes after Barack and Obama appointed</text>
  <text start="1898.19" dur="6.7">DOJ IG Michael Horowitz himself so</text>
  <text start="1901.94" dur="5.02">basically the tweet is here as bad as</text>
  <text start="1904.89" dur="5.009">the IG report is for the FBI and others</text>
  <text start="1906.96" dur="5.37">and it is really bad remember that IG</text>
  <text start="1909.899" dur="5.341">Horowitz was appointed by Obama there</text>
  <text start="1912.33" dur="4.56">was tremendous bias and guilt exposed so</text>
  <text start="1915.24" dur="4.23">obvious but Horowitz couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1916.89" dur="6.269">himself to say it big credibility loss</text>
  <text start="1919.47" dur="5.73">Obama knew everything so of course here</text>
  <text start="1923.159" dur="5.041">he is going after Obama and Horowitz</text>
  <text start="1925.2" dur="5.04">himself as just you know not doing the</text>
  <text start="1928.2" dur="4.14">best of jobs that he could have done and</text>
  <text start="1930.24" dur="4.14">then we&amp;#39;re gonna of course see Huber</text>
  <text start="1932.34" dur="3.059">come out with all of the and Barr come</text>
  <text start="1934.38" dur="3.33">out with all of the clarifying</text>
  <text start="1935.399" dur="3.78">information bar already saying that you</text>
  <text start="1937.71" dur="4.86">know Horowitz got it wrong and that he</text>
  <text start="1939.179" dur="6.661">knew that there was more to it so you</text>
  <text start="1942.57" dur="5.849">know this is already fascinating and the</text>
  <text start="1945.84" dur="4.8">last and not least another Trump tweet</text>
  <text start="1948.419" dur="4.62">the thing that started all this it seems</text>
  <text start="1950.64" dur="5.43">this Trump tweeting quote could it be</text>
  <text start="1953.039" dur="5.27">years in jail as he responds to call me</text>
  <text start="1956.07" dur="5.07">in the interview with Chris Wallace</text>
  <text start="1958.309" dur="5.141">where he basically admits that he was</text>
  <text start="1961.14" dur="5.13">wrong to say that the FISA process was</text>
  <text start="1963.45" dur="4.29">followed so guys it&amp;#39;s really interesting</text>
  <text start="1966.27" dur="3.84">and here&amp;#39;s Trump&amp;#39;s tweet</text>
  <text start="1967.74" dur="5.49">so now homies admitting he was wrong Wow</text>
  <text start="1970.11" dur="4.86">but he&amp;#39;s only doing so because he got</text>
  <text start="1973.23" dur="4.35">caught red-handed he was actually caught</text>
  <text start="1974.97" dur="3.39">a long time ago so what are the</text>
  <text start="1977.58" dur="2.61">consequences</text>
  <text start="1978.36" dur="4.5">or it&amp;#39;s unlawful conduct could it be</text>
  <text start="1980.19" dur="5.04">years in jail where are the apologies to</text>
  <text start="1982.86" dur="3.9">me and others gentlemen so of course we</text>
  <text start="1985.23" dur="2.85">are not going to see apologies happen</text>
  <text start="1986.76" dur="2.82">these people are really out to get</text>
  <text start="1988.08" dur="3.96">President Trump they still hate him</text>
  <text start="1989.58" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re just crying the crocodile tears</text>
  <text start="1992.04" dur="3.87">of being the victim right now</text>
