  <text start="68.43" dur="3.75">decided to stay a bit longer</text>
  <text start="70.38" dur="5.01">because I saw that there was something</text>
  <text start="72.18" dur="5.22">happening and I started to use my skill</text>
  <text start="75.39" dur="4.89">which is to speak English to spread and</text>
  <text start="77.4" dur="5.34">be my perspective on the yellowest</text>
  <text start="80.28" dur="3.96">movements because I was I was upset to</text>
  <text start="82.74" dur="3.059">see the English narrative you know</text>
  <text start="84.24" dur="6.33">mainstream media I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>

  <text start="94.5" dur="4.86">being violent and stuff like that this</text>
  <text start="96.6" dur="4.47">is not the truth so I made a post on</text>
  <text start="99.36" dur="3.39">Facebook called friends has a message</text>
  <text start="101.07" dur="3.54">for the world and it has been seen by</text>
  <text start="102.75" dur="4.53">million people in three weeks or</text>
  <text start="104.61" dur="4.35">something like that and suddenly I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="107.28" dur="3.269">been interviewed by many people and Here</text>
  <text start="108.96" dur="5.46">I am like I&amp;#39;m trying to give a</text>
  <text start="110.549" dur="5.67">perspective from French citizen educated</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="4.559">and and trying to understand the</text>
  <text start="116.219" dur="5.01">underlying level of what what are the</text>
  <text start="118.979" dur="5.341">roots of what pushed the French people</text>
  <text start="121.229" dur="5.581">to trigger what we call now a global</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="4.549">revolution as the whole planet is</text>
  <text start="126.81" dur="4.5">involved into that that movement</text>
  <text start="128.869" dur="3.881">yeah it&amp;#39;s spreading and and people are</text>
  <text start="131.31" dur="1.96">not out there getting shot with with</text>
  <text start="132.75" dur="2.62">rubber</text>
  <text start="133.27" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s and water cannons and things like</text>
  <text start="135.37" dur="3.48">that and getting beat up just for fun I</text>
  <text start="137.56" dur="2.88">mean there&amp;#39;s a reason behind this</text>
  <text start="138.85" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s obviously some passion behind it</text>
  <text start="140.44" dur="3.72">and we need to hear what those reasons</text>
  <text start="142.3" dur="3.36">are rather than just beat those people</text>
  <text start="144.16" dur="3.48">down into submission because that&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="145.66" dur="3.96">gonna make it worse it seems there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="147.64" dur="3.99">slowing and the worse they get the more</text>
  <text start="149.62" dur="3.84">the ill of us turn out so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="151.63" dur="3.3">afraid it seems and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="153.46" dur="4.11">great thing to see I really like to see</text>
  <text start="154.93" dur="3.99">this sort of freedom you know in you</text>
  <text start="157.57" dur="3.15">know Frances once again showing the</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="4.17">world how to protest you know you guys</text>
  <text start="160.72" dur="4.29">are the best so you know if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="163.09" dur="3.36">mind like you get people caught up to</text>
  <text start="165.01" dur="5.16">where we are and then we&amp;#39;ll kind of go</text>
  <text start="166.45" dur="5.51">through you know the modern yep so what</text>
  <text start="170.17" dur="4.22">do you want to know well just you know</text>
  <text start="171.96" dur="5.56">briefly what what in your opinion</text>
  <text start="174.39" dur="4.69">prompted the rioting the yellow vests</text>
  <text start="177.52" dur="2.91">everybody starts wearing them now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="179.08" dur="4.23">spread throughout different countries</text>
  <text start="180.43" dur="4.5">throughout the world like you said why</text>
  <text start="183.31" dur="3.42">did we get to that point what was the</text>
  <text start="184.93" dur="3.33">government&amp;#39;s you know reaction kind of</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="3.87">they ignored it at first I guess and</text>
  <text start="188.26" dur="4.83">then micron and and his PM decided to</text>
  <text start="190.6" dur="5.25">come out and and just be violent you</text>
  <text start="193.09" dur="4.619">know just from your perspective how is</text>
  <text start="195.85" dur="3.63">it evolved from from just a few weeks</text>
  <text start="197.709" dur="4.081">ago when it started it seems and then</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="4.02">now all right let&amp;#39;s start from the</text>
  <text start="201.79" dur="4.169">beginning like the movement studying in</text>
  <text start="203.5" dur="4.98">17th of November so it&amp;#39;s something still</text>
  <text start="205.959" dur="4.411">very young like it&amp;#39;s just a to two and a</text>
  <text start="208.48" dur="4.29">half months old so it&amp;#39;s something still</text>
  <text start="210.37" dur="4.35">very young and the way it happened is</text>
  <text start="212.77" dur="3.78">that I believe that in many countries in</text>
  <text start="214.72" dur="3.48">the world there&amp;#39;s a lot of people who</text>
  <text start="216.55" dur="3.93">are getting upset with the way the world</text>
  <text start="218.2" dur="4.59">is going but there&amp;#39;s this type of</text>
  <text start="220.48" dur="4.44">feeling of of not being capable of</text>
  <text start="222.79" dur="3.72">putting the names on the roots of the</text>
  <text start="224.92" dur="4.08">roots of the roots of the problems and</text>
  <text start="226.51" dur="4.65">the thing is that France has that very</text>
  <text start="229" dur="3.63">particular way to express himself which</text>
  <text start="231.16" dur="3.66">is when they don&amp;#39;t they are not happy</text>
  <text start="232.63" dur="4.38">which is freeze basically they freeze</text>
  <text start="234.82" dur="4.77">the economy that frees the system that</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="5.76">just protests and they just like express</text>
  <text start="239.59" dur="6.45">what what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="242.77" dur="4.65">wrong and the way it happened surprised</text>
  <text start="246.04" dur="3.449">everyone because we didn&amp;#39;t really know</text>
  <text start="247.42" dur="4.53">that there was so many people ready to</text>
  <text start="249.489" dur="4.111">go out because for the first time in our</text>
  <text start="251.95" dur="4.32">recent history like I think the last</text>
  <text start="253.6" dur="4.83">time it happened was in 1968 so it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="256.27" dur="5.49">quite quite a while ago for the first</text>
  <text start="258.43" dur="6.27">time in the last 50 years we started to</text>
  <text start="261.76" dur="4.75">get out with no real real indication</text>
  <text start="264.7" dur="5.5">with no</text>
  <text start="266.51" dur="6.3">Union behind us with no political</text>
  <text start="270.2" dur="5.82">parties with no it wasn&amp;#39;t for brick city</text>
  <text start="272.81" dur="4.77">for Fred Fred&amp;#39;s it or it wasn&amp;#39;t for real</text>
  <text start="276.02" dur="3.3">like tax was just something that</text>
  <text start="277.58" dur="4.08">triggers it wasn&amp;#39;t really the real</text>
  <text start="279.32" dur="5.19">purpose because like we we can I think</text>
  <text start="281.66" dur="4.47">from a dollar a euro the liter up to two</text>
  <text start="284.51" dur="4.95">euros a liter in less than a year so</text>
  <text start="286.13" dur="6.09">they doubled the price of petrol so we</text>
  <text start="289.46" dur="4.95">we had many occasion before to get upset</text>
  <text start="292.22" dur="3.42">so why did it happen there I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="294.41" dur="3.9">it was just the right time the right</text>
  <text start="295.64" dur="4.59">pace but now the people are out what</text>
  <text start="298.31" dur="3.12">happens that they just starting to make</text>
  <text start="300.23" dur="3.3">something that they haven&amp;#39;t done for a</text>
  <text start="301.43" dur="3.54">while which is to connect to connect</text>
  <text start="303.53" dur="3.99">with the neighbors to reconnect with</text>
  <text start="304.97" dur="4.77">their friends we were just there because</text>
  <text start="307.52" dur="3.9">now since the 50 years we now have that</text>
  <text start="309.74" dur="5.55">interface in front of our face which is</text>
  <text start="311.42" dur="6.78">called TV iphone/ipad like those media</text>
  <text start="315.29" dur="4.71">which are blocking us for for going out</text>
  <text start="318.2" dur="4.17">and speaking to our fellows brothers and</text>
  <text start="320" dur="4.89">sisters and that that&amp;#39;s the first thing</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="5.7">that really shocked people is that first</text>
  <text start="324.89" dur="6.03">of all we kind of depict in a form of</text>
  <text start="328.07" dur="5.52">hatred between each other just through</text>
  <text start="330.92" dur="4.83">the the narrative of the mainstream</text>
  <text start="333.59" dur="4.35">media and such suddenly we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="335.75" dur="4.05">to realize that we&amp;#39;re not like who cares</text>
  <text start="337.94" dur="5.07">if you&amp;#39;re voting realized or left or</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="5.22">right or if you&amp;#39;re black just like you</text>
  <text start="343.01" dur="4.98">which is humans and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="4.86">realize that that that we maybe have</text>
  <text start="347.99" dur="4.02">been manipulated for years to be</text>
  <text start="349.88" dur="4.86">separated and divided and that now that</text>
  <text start="352.01" dur="5.58">we reconnected all together we will not</text>
  <text start="354.74" dur="4.62">stop until we will achieve something and</text>
  <text start="357.59" dur="3.57">as you said the response from the</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="4.23">governments were initially to deny the</text>
  <text start="361.16" dur="5.31">things and such as let us go but then</text>
  <text start="363.59" dur="5.55">the violence escalated very quickly not</text>
  <text start="366.47" dur="4.02">from our side actually like initially I</text>
  <text start="369.14" dur="3.54">guess there was like a little bit of</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="3.63">violence like it was more frustration I</text>
  <text start="372.68" dur="4.41">think the first weekend was a little bit</text>
  <text start="374.12" dur="4.71">violent and especially in Paris like no</text>
  <text start="377.09" dur="3.42">arrests of friends like all the videos</text>
  <text start="378.83" dur="3.33">that people sees is what&amp;#39;s happening on</text>
  <text start="380.51" dur="3.33">the shows that he&amp;#39;s a but friends is a</text>
  <text start="382.16" dur="3.03">big country you know so if you have a</text>
  <text start="383.84" dur="3.93">little bit of violence in one specific</text>
  <text start="385.19" dur="4.17">street in the world in your country it</text>
  <text start="387.77" dur="5.46">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the whole country is</text>
  <text start="389.36" dur="6.63">in civil war yeah I know that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="393.23" dur="4.59">men stream media loves that narrative</text>
  <text start="395.99" dur="3.18">saying oh look how Hollywood look what&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="406.33" dur="3.959">worldwide issue yeah of course of course</text>
  <text start="408.61" dur="3.269">I&amp;#39;m just talking about the violence like</text>
  <text start="410.289" dur="3.66">the violence scene that people have seen</text>
  <text start="411.879" dur="4.35">didn&amp;#39;t happen everywhere everywhere in</text>
  <text start="413.949" dur="3.631">in France especially they only happen</text>
  <text start="416.229" dur="2.94">for the first week</text>
  <text start="417.58" dur="3.72">like the first two weekends I would say</text>
  <text start="419.169" dur="3.21">in in Paris most of the other</text>

  <text start="424.719" dur="3.51">were quite peaceful and okay</text>
  <text start="426.099" dur="4.081">but we&amp;#39;re starting to see weeks after</text>
  <text start="428.229" dur="4.68">weeks you have to understand that the</text>
  <text start="430.18" dur="5.099">policemen are doing like something like</text>
  <text start="432.909" dur="4.32">70 hours a week for probably two months</text>
  <text start="435.279" dur="6.331">now and the government refused to pay</text>
  <text start="437.229" dur="6.18">the the extra hours which is which is</text>
  <text start="441.61" dur="4.079">upsetting a lot of those guys because</text>
  <text start="443.409" dur="4.051">those guys are it&amp;#39;s amazing we have the</text>
  <text start="445.689" dur="4.111">best government in the world like they</text>
  <text start="447.46" dur="4.439">don&amp;#39;t even take care of the only thing</text>
  <text start="449.8" dur="4.38">that is protecting them from us you know</text>
  <text start="451.899" dur="5.07">like they&amp;#39;re that level of stupid you</text>

  <text start="456.969" dur="3.241">funny what&amp;#39;s happening but in the</text>
  <text start="458.05" dur="4.039">meantime they gave some orders like</text>
  <text start="460.21" dur="5.549">we&amp;#39;re getting now into a point where</text>
  <text start="462.089" dur="6.401">research yesterday I heard that when a</text>
  <text start="465.759" dur="7.171">yellow vest is heated by is injured by</text>

  <text start="479.02" dur="5.879">is going in in this country like we had</text>
  <text start="481.509" dur="7.231">something like I think now 90 amputated</text>

  <text start="501.729" dur="3.99">in my hand and I lost my head do you</text>
  <text start="504.249" dur="3.63">believe that the government would</text>
  <text start="505.719" dur="4.98">actually say anything about these 90</text>
  <text start="507.879" dur="5.52">citizen injured by the police zero</text>

  <text start="530.529" dur="3.601">policemen are treating them are starting</text>
  <text start="532.87" dur="3.269">to waking up like</text>

  <text start="787.13" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re just escalating where are you</text>
  <text start="790.19" dur="3.63">seeing things happening where those are</text>
  <text start="792.68" dur="4.23">the kind of areas that I want to focus</text>
  <text start="793.82" dur="5.13">on first a few minutes so the you know</text>
  <text start="796.91" dur="3.54">this movement is a process it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="798.95" dur="3">something that is evolving constantly</text>
  <text start="800.45" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="801.95" dur="4.079">you know so basically between the</text>
  <text start="803.99" dur="3.87">beginning and now in the early beginning</text>
  <text start="806.029" dur="7.11">there was a lot of repetition about like</text>
  <text start="807.86" dur="9.659">let&amp;#39;s tax and not known GST or say that</text>
  <text start="813.139" dur="6.301">v80 on the like primal dual usage</text>
  <text start="817.519" dur="3.391">you know like water electricity stuff</text>
  <text start="819.44" dur="3.209">like that you know it was just like</text>
  <text start="820.91" dur="3.21">money oriented and then they are like</text>
  <text start="822.649" dur="2.101">people about like the freedom of</text>
  <text start="824.12" dur="2.43">vaccinating</text>
  <text start="824.75" dur="4.139">people like you know like the sovereign</text>
  <text start="826.55" dur="5.039">sovereign aspects of the body you know</text>
  <text start="828.889" dur="4.471">like because now we force we&amp;#39;re forced</text>
  <text start="831.589" dur="4.381">to vaccinate 11 vaccines in the first</text>
  <text start="833.36" dur="3.99">four years of the baby&amp;#39;s life and French</text>
  <text start="835.97" dur="2.64">people doesn&amp;#39;t really like that okay</text>
  <text start="837.35" dur="3.33">like it&amp;#39;s not a question about do we</text>
  <text start="838.61" dur="3.96">believe in vaccine or not it&amp;#39;s just that</text>
  <text start="840.68" dur="3.57">we should have the right to decide</text>
  <text start="842.57" dur="3.66">whether or not because we are the one</text>
  <text start="844.25" dur="3.3">responsible for our kids okay so we</text>
  <text start="846.23" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t really like people telling us what</text>
  <text start="847.55" dur="5.159">we should do with our kids and and then</text>
  <text start="850.67" dur="4.59">like there&amp;#39;s so many things that the the</text>
  <text start="852.709" dur="5.43">the ID that emerged from the group which</text>
  <text start="855.26" dur="4.65">is now starting to really kick in in in</text>
  <text start="858.139" dur="3.69">a whole country and not just in our</text>
  <text start="859.91" dur="4.289">universe actually going way beyond the</text>
  <text start="861.829" dur="5.13">US is that notional for the referendum</text>
  <text start="864.199" dur="4.231">initiated by the citizen like in short</text>
  <text start="866.959" dur="3.511">on the Ric Ric</text>
  <text start="868.43" dur="4.68">so referendum initiative Bella citizen</text>
  <text start="870.47" dur="5.22">is them is a simple ID that we should</text>
  <text start="873.11" dur="4.14">have as a citizen&amp;#39;s a constitutional</text>
  <text start="875.69" dur="4.649">right to trigger a national referendum</text>
  <text start="877.25" dur="4.5">from our own initiatives because a real</text>
  <text start="880.339" dur="3.75">democracy is not that much about</text>
  <text start="881.75" dur="4.35">choosing our masters it&amp;#39;s actually also</text>
  <text start="884.089" dur="3.99">being able to control them okay because</text>
  <text start="886.1" dur="3.419">if you if you let the Masters doing</text>
  <text start="888.079" dur="3.151">whatever they want like then we arrived</text>
  <text start="889.519" dur="3.481">to a point where no matter if you agree</text>
  <text start="891.23" dur="3.45">or not with them they would just do</text>
  <text start="893" dur="3.87">whatever they want and this is not okay</text>
  <text start="894.68" dur="4.32">like democracy means demos Kratos which</text>
  <text start="896.87" dur="3.63">is power to the people so if the power</text>
  <text start="899" dur="3.81">to the people is only the power to</text>
  <text start="900.5" dur="3.93">choose who&amp;#39;s gonna dictate you what</text>
  <text start="902.81" dur="4.279">whatever they want this is not democracy</text>
  <text start="904.43" dur="4.56">and I think this is one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="907.089" dur="4.421">realization that the relativist have</text>
  <text start="908.99" dur="5.94">been through that that true democracy</text>
  <text start="911.51" dur="4.86">needs to come through a control of the</text>
  <text start="914.93" dur="4.11">people that we put in charge</text>
  <text start="916.37" dur="4.709">we cannot just let them forefathers do</text>
  <text start="919.04" dur="4.529">whatever they want not being accountable</text>
  <text start="921.079" dur="3.841">not being responsible and I was waiting</text>
  <text start="923.569" dur="4.351">for another third year to choose another</text>
  <text start="924.92" dur="4.289">dictator this is this this is 2019 we</text>
  <text start="927.92" dur="3.419">have a lot of technology that could</text>
  <text start="929.209" dur="4.591">allow us to make something much much</text>
  <text start="931.339" dur="3.531">better in place and just that simple</text>
  <text start="933.8" dur="2.96">idea of</text>
  <text start="934.87" dur="3.33">being capable of triggering national</text>
  <text start="936.76" dur="3.6">referendum from Owen in its receive</text>
  <text start="938.2" dur="4.68">initiative could actually fix the whole</text>
  <text start="940.36" dur="4.62">system so this has been the wrong</text>
  <text start="942.88" dur="3.66">education that is now really implemented</text>
  <text start="944.98" dur="4.17">because there&amp;#39;s absolutely no point</text>
  <text start="946.54" dur="4.68">asking or begging for being listen we</text>
  <text start="949.15" dur="4.11">want to become powerful and with that</text>
  <text start="951.22" dur="4.98">rich we can become powerful we can</text>
  <text start="953.26" dur="4.62">impose by basically the idea is very</text>
  <text start="956.2" dur="4.17">simple let&amp;#39;s say we have 1% of the</text>
  <text start="957.88" dur="4.44">population who has an ID about tags or</text>
  <text start="960.37" dur="4.92">about like retirement age or about the</text>
  <text start="962.32" dur="4.8">amount of hours we need to work for week</text>
  <text start="965.29" dur="4.55">or something like that whatever like not</text>
  <text start="967.12" dur="5.55">everything about vaccination health food</text>
  <text start="969.84" dur="4.48">education everything you have let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="972.67" dur="3.63">1% of the population who is signing a</text>
  <text start="974.32" dur="4.11">petition and decide to trigger a</text>
  <text start="976.3" dur="4.47">national referendum if this national</text>
  <text start="978.43" dur="5.7">referendum hits the population and 50%</text>
  <text start="980.77" dur="5.25">one more vote for that ID then this idea</text>
  <text start="984.13" dur="3.9">is automatically implemented into the</text>
  <text start="986.02" dur="3.96">law without asking the Senate without</text>
  <text start="988.03" dur="4.14">asking the Parliament without asking</text>
  <text start="989.98" dur="4.62">governments and this is how we can</text>
  <text start="992.17" dur="5.28">actually regain our democracy damage not</text>
  <text start="994.6" dur="5.94">by hoping to be listened not by striking</text>
  <text start="997.45" dur="6.96">to be listened by being powerful so that</text>
  <text start="1000.54" dur="6.39">idea of of powerlessness as the roots of</text>
  <text start="1004.41" dur="4.77">of everything that is going wrong in our</text>
  <text start="1006.93" dur="4.56">world is something that is right now</text>
  <text start="1009.18" dur="4.64">spreading across the world and I&amp;#39;m proud</text>
  <text start="1011.49" dur="4.8">to say that I participate to do that</text>
  <text start="1013.82" dur="5.92">you&amp;#39;re standing in the moment of history</text>
  <text start="1016.29" dur="5.79">I mean you are trying to put the</text>
  <text start="1019.74" dur="4.02">tentacles back in the box and sort of</text>
  <text start="1022.08" dur="3.42">put some restraints on this monstrous</text>

  <text start="1119.76" dur="6.44">immigrants per year and this is the the</text>
  <text start="1122.309" dur="5.971">UN proposition and they criminalized the</text>
  <text start="1126.2" dur="3.94">anti-immigration protests so if we</text>

  <text start="1138.78" dur="3.81">people are in war with nationalism</text>
  <text start="1140.7" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re trying to associate the notion</text>
  <text start="1142.59" dur="4.74">of nationalism with fascism which is</text>
  <text start="1144.96" dur="3.54">pathetic like me they actually by</text>
  <text start="1147.33" dur="3.63">repeating and repeating and repeating</text>
  <text start="1148.5" dur="5.01">via that notion that if you love your</text>
  <text start="1150.96" dur="4.44">country if you love the land if you love</text>
  <text start="1153.51" dur="2.58">the culture if you attach to your</text>
  <text start="1155.4" dur="3.81">ancestors</text>
  <text start="1156.09" dur="6.54">you must be imperialists and and and</text>
  <text start="1159.21" dur="6.089">this is this is insane that fascism was</text>
  <text start="1162.63" dur="5.37">was about like yakeen race and and</text>
  <text start="1165.299" dur="5.221">bringing the Aryan race across the world</text>
  <text start="1168" dur="4.23">like nationalism is about okay I love my</text>
  <text start="1170.52" dur="3.659">country I love my culture and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1172.23" dur="4.47">about that okay like they trying to</text>
  <text start="1174.179" dur="4.141">associate that and some people not all</text>
  <text start="1176.7" dur="4.109">of them luckily are stupid enough to</text>
  <text start="1178.32" dur="5.13">associate nationalism with fascism and</text>
  <text start="1180.809" dur="4.921">and like this isn&amp;#39;t just not okay like</text>
  <text start="1183.45" dur="4.14">if you refuse to have 1 million new</text>
  <text start="1185.73" dur="4.559">immigrants per year like France is about</text>
  <text start="1187.59" dur="5.1">65 million people so if in 30 years</text>
  <text start="1190.289" dur="5.37">you&amp;#39;re receiving 1 million new immigrant</text>
  <text start="1192.69" dur="5.76">per year in 30 years your population</text>

  <text start="1198.45" dur="3.62">it will actually come from</text>
  <text start="1200.51" dur="4.23">whole foreign culture that has</text>
  <text start="1202.07" dur="6.48">absolutely nothing to do with your 2000</text>
  <text start="1204.74" dur="7.02">years history and and behind the second</text>
  <text start="1208.55" dur="4.77">agenda is to dumb down the salaries</text>
  <text start="1211.76" dur="3.9">because those people would be more than</text>
  <text start="1213.32" dur="3.93">happy to work $4 an hour like like</text>
  <text start="1215.66" dur="4.2">Germany is doing like Germany is proud</text>
  <text start="1217.25" dur="7.77">to have put in place an 80 cents 80</text>
  <text start="1219.86" dur="7.23">cents our fee for workers so they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1225.02" dur="3.48">have any any important employment look</text>
  <text start="1227.09" dur="3.03">look at Germany they&amp;#39;re doing an amazing</text>
  <text start="1228.5" dur="4.41">job they don&amp;#39;t have any unemployed</text>
  <text start="1230.12" dur="5.55">people the people work for 90 cents an</text>
  <text start="1232.91" dur="4.62">hour so like I think this is the plan</text>
  <text start="1235.67" dur="4.26">behind they just want to dumb down the</text>
  <text start="1237.53" dur="4.92">middle class and just like reduce that</text>
  <text start="1239.93" dur="4.62">that power of buying by putting more and</text>
  <text start="1242.45" dur="4.17">more people who are going to be happy to</text>
  <text start="1244.55" dur="4.5">work for for nothing why are the rich</text>
  <text start="1246.62" dur="3.78">people are making like billions and</text>
  <text start="1249.05" dur="3.06">billions and billions the poor people</text>
  <text start="1250.4" dur="3.69">are going to fight each other to survive</text>
  <text start="1252.11" dur="3.45">and I think this is what France is</text>
  <text start="1254.09" dur="3.84">standing against my friend says now</text>
  <text start="1255.56" dur="4.44">enough is enough we see where you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1266.57" dur="4.44">die for that and this is I believe what</text>
  <text start="1268.73" dur="5.1">is inspiring the world right now is to</text>
  <text start="1271.01" dur="5.28">see a whole country rising up putting</text>
  <text start="1273.83" dur="5.16">that line on the floor and say enough is</text>
  <text start="1276.29" dur="5.28">enough we&amp;#39;re setting an example for sure</text>
  <text start="1278.99" dur="3.9">and you guys I mean at the end of the</text>
  <text start="1281.57" dur="3.03">day even though I think the Dalai Lama</text>
  <text start="1282.89" dur="3.39">said that Europe should be left for the</text>
  <text start="1284.6" dur="4.08">Europeans I mean you have the right to</text>

  <text start="1300.68" dur="4.68">traders should be should be executed</text>
  <text start="1302.42" dur="4.5">like this absolutely no point about that</text>
  <text start="1305.36" dur="3">and this is actually what is interesting</text>
  <text start="1306.92" dur="2.64">because every time that you&amp;#39;re talking</text>

  <text start="1421.62" dur="4.29">wisdom is coming from experience you</text>
  <text start="1423.6" dur="4.05">know you can read hours and hours and</text>

  <text start="1436.86" dur="4.44">democracy the way it has been done</text>
  <text start="1438.57" dur="5.91">separate the notion of decision-making</text>
