  <text start="78.19" dur="3.24">economic stuff soon you know these are</text>
  <text start="80.17" dur="2.76">pages I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to do for a</text>
  <text start="81.43" dur="3.21">while and I&amp;#39;ve been focusing so much on</text>
  <text start="82.93" dur="3.78">the Q portion of the website on the home</text>
  <text start="84.64" dur="4.17">page which is pretty hooked up right now</text>
  <text start="86.71" dur="3.78">with tons of great information in</text>
  <text start="88.81" dur="3.99">addition to just the regular Q post</text>
  <text start="90.49" dur="5.04">above it there&amp;#39;s a cylinders the the</text>

  <text start="104.26" dur="3.719">fill out the health I want to I want to</text>
  <text start="105.61" dur="4.2">get some kind of a you know a a bootcamp</text>
  <text start="107.979" dur="3.121">of education for people that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="109.81" dur="3.18">cost a lot of money that you can just</text>
  <text start="111.1" dur="3.93">sit there and you can just deep dive</text>
  <text start="112.99" dur="3.63">research and information this goal is</text>
  <text start="115.03" dur="6.54">not to charge you for this stuff the</text>
  <text start="116.62" dur="7.289">goal is to is to get a basic a basic</text>
  <text start="121.57" dur="4.02">education on everything from health to</text>
  <text start="123.909" dur="3.661">you know financial literacy to</text>
  <text start="125.59" dur="4.41">everything that they skipped out on you</text>
  <text start="127.57" dur="4.65">or they screwed you over on in the</text>
  <text start="130" dur="3.66">traditional education system you know</text>
  <text start="132.22" dur="3.39">this could be really helpful especially</text>
  <text start="133.66" dur="3.72">for my fellow Millennials out there who</text>
  <text start="135.61" dur="4.23">may be starting to get woke about</text>
  <text start="137.38" dur="4.08">this stuff maybe a little bit less so</text>
  <text start="139.84" dur="3.39">for some of you who have experience you</text>
  <text start="141.46" dur="3.15">know you guys have lived the the life</text>
  <text start="143.23" dur="2.88">and you guys kind of know some of this</text>
  <text start="144.61" dur="4.74">stuff from the from the hard edge of</text>
  <text start="146.11" dur="4.56">experience and I think Jordan actually</text>
  <text start="149.35" dur="2.7">pointed out a really good point recently</text>
  <text start="150.67" dur="3.36">Jordans say there he says that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.05" dur="4.32">an experience and there&amp;#39;s a research and</text>
  <text start="154.03" dur="5.46">you need both for a complete picture so</text>
  <text start="156.37" dur="5.37">this will give you guys the the research</text>
  <text start="159.49" dur="4.29">aspect and then you guys who are already</text>
  <text start="161.74" dur="4.05">older have the research and you younger</text>
  <text start="163.78" dur="4.56">folks like me who don&amp;#39;t necessarily have</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="3.51">a ton of experience with life maybe you</text>
  <text start="168.34" dur="3.36">have been through the school of hard</text>
  <text start="169.3" dur="6.15">knocks a little bit like me but you know</text>
  <text start="171.7" dur="5.79">either way I want to just include some</text>
  <text start="175.45" dur="3.57">some basic education speaking of</text>
  <text start="177.49" dur="3.3">experience in life definitely have</text>
  <text start="179.02" dur="3.15">children it&amp;#39;s definitely worth all of</text>
  <text start="180.79" dur="3.24">those little core you hear the cries but</text>
  <text start="182.17" dur="4.92">you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t see the moments</text>
  <text start="184.03" dur="5.04">where you were you when you first wake</text>
  <text start="187.09" dur="4.86">up during the day and you go over to the</text>
  <text start="189.07" dur="4.14">baby crib like and she or where she</text>
  <text start="191.95" dur="2.67">starts to wake up for the day I guess</text>
  <text start="193.21" dur="4.14">because I&amp;#39;m usually up before her but</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="5.46">and you look down and she sees you and</text>
  <text start="197.35" dur="4.2">she just does that smile you know like</text>
  <text start="200.08" dur="6.75">that&amp;#39;s that that breaks my heart every</text>
  <text start="201.55" dur="7.68">time anyway and and by the way mama is</text>
  <text start="206.83" dur="3.87">jealous because every time I go over to</text>
  <text start="209.23" dur="3.3">the baby she does this little like</text>
  <text start="210.7" dur="3.36">squirm thing and like and wants me to</text>
  <text start="212.53" dur="3.51">put my hand behind her back and pick her</text>
  <text start="214.06" dur="2.37">up she knows she knows she knows what</text>
  <text start="216.04" dur="2.31">she&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="216.43" dur="4.14">every time we&amp;#39;ve tested it and we did it</text>
  <text start="218.35" dur="4.86">like four times in a row she knows how</text>
  <text start="220.57" dur="5.25">to how to get Baba which is Chinese for</text>
  <text start="223.21" dur="5.4">dad not to be confused with Baba which</text>
  <text start="225.82" dur="5.52">apparently is Chinese for I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="228.61" dur="6.36">like Chinese it&amp;#39;s very confusing anyway</text>

  <text start="645.22" dur="5.719">of into these products like like if you</text>
  <text start="647.949" dur="5.971">like the the liposomal vitamins and you</text>
  <text start="650.939" dur="4.811">actually get into it on a recurring</text>
  <text start="653.92" dur="3.69">basis I might actually get like a</text>
  <text start="655.75" dur="4.379">recurring income from that like a little</text>
  <text start="657.61" dur="4.409">bit here a little bit there times you</text>
