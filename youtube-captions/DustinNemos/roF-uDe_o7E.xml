  <text start="13.61" dur="4.81">commis not necessarily off the hook and</text>
  <text start="16.32" dur="4.529">there&amp;#39;s a lot more to it and in fact</text>
  <text start="18.42" dur="4.079">there&amp;#39;s quite a few bombshells so all of</text>
  <text start="20.849" dur="3.75">this and more right after a short word</text>
  <text start="22.499" dur="3.6">from our Patriot sponsors and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="24.599" dur="4.02">gonna dive into the news there was a</text>
  <text start="26.099" dur="4.56">time when I had my head in the sand then</text>
  <text start="28.619" dur="4.761">I found out that powered players pass</text>
  <text start="30.659" dur="5.551">lies for truth and truth for the lies</text>
  <text start="33.38" dur="5.83">especially in areas of life and hell I</text>
  <text start="36.21" dur="5.85">used to stay quiet and now I speak up a</text>
  <text start="39.21" dur="6.15">red pill my family a red pill my friends</text>

  <text start="55.44" dur="6.38">living calm wake up stand up speak up</text>
  <text start="65.37" dur="4.33">all right I want to dive through a</text>
  <text start="67.27" dur="5.07">couple of things not related to Horowitz</text>
  <text start="69.7" dur="4.71">first just get them out of the way so</text>
  <text start="72.34" dur="4.47">this is actually a minor piece of news</text>
  <text start="74.41" dur="4.53">it has a kind of a big bombshell in it</text>
  <text start="76.81" dur="3.87">now we I didn&amp;#39;t know for the longest</text>
  <text start="78.94" dur="3.33">time I was saying queue away or whatever</text>
  <text start="80.68" dur="3.96">but whew why I guess is how you</text>
  <text start="82.27" dur="4.17">pronounce it the company that&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="84.64" dur="4.38">close ties to the Chinese government</text>
  <text start="86.44" dur="4.74">massive company and of course you&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="89.02" dur="3.96">some back-and-forth issues between Trump</text>
  <text start="91.18" dur="4.11">like banning them and in saying that</text>
  <text start="92.98" dur="4.11">China is using the despite on people and</text>
  <text start="95.29" dur="3.81">China saying this is a private company</text>
  <text start="97.09" dur="3.72">we have nothing to do with it and the</text>
  <text start="99.1" dur="3.3">executives of the private company saying</text>
  <text start="100.81" dur="2.49">this is just private company they have</text>
  <text start="102.4" dur="3.36">nothing to do with us</text>
  <text start="103.3" dur="5.01">and I think I&amp;#39;m something summarizing it</text>
  <text start="105.76" dur="5.67">very very briefly for you I&amp;#39;m good</text>
  <text start="108.31" dur="6.3">enough but so choose woo why or else is</text>
  <text start="111.43" dur="5.25">is the message that one Danish island</text>
  <text start="114.61" dur="3.39">chain is getting with a little tiny</text>
  <text start="116.68" dur="4.47">government that kind of represents</text>
  <text start="118" dur="4.77">itself but China wants to move in on the</text>
  <text start="121.15" dur="5.16">turf and they&amp;#39;re sort of implying</text>
  <text start="122.77" dur="6.3">threats or or the the withholding of</text>
  <text start="126.31" dur="4.29">funds or trade deals if they don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="129.07" dur="3.96">their way in this case which is very</text>
  <text start="130.6" dur="4.89">interesting because China generally says</text>
  <text start="133.03" dur="4.53">this is just a private company nothing</text>
  <text start="135.49" dur="5.19">to do with us right but now we see them</text>
  <text start="137.56" dur="5.82">actually working together now in China a</text>
  <text start="140.68" dur="5.49">private company as only as private as it</text>
  <text start="143.38" dur="4.8">has political use and of course as soon</text>
  <text start="146.17" dur="3.96">as there&amp;#39;s a utility they&amp;#39;re gonna find</text>
  <text start="148.18" dur="4.32">a way to exploit it so they have Google</text>
  <text start="150.13" dur="5.97">building their their private internet</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="5.4">search engines and their new control</text>
  <text start="156.1" dur="4.92">grid for the for the citizens there and</text>
  <text start="157.9" dur="5.73">the slave citizens they have why</text>
  <text start="161.02" dur="5.13">building you know probably built-in</text>
  <text start="163.63" dur="4.56">tracking systems and spy stuff for their</text>
  <text start="166.15" dur="4.98">technology so that China has a backdoor</text>
  <text start="168.19" dur="5.73">and can spy on people as Trump was</text>
  <text start="171.13" dur="4.92">alluding and you know there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="173.92" dur="3.27">lot to this so anytime there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="176.05" dur="3.06">government with that much power they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="177.19" dur="5.34">gonna lean on companies to get their way</text>
  <text start="179.11" dur="5.79">when it comes to supposed security or</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="4.5">threats right that&amp;#39;s always the excuse</text>
  <text start="184.9" dur="3.839">they give you but they always want all</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="3.75">the private information they always want</text>
  <text start="188.739" dur="5.701">all the power they always want all the</text>
  <text start="190.78" dur="5.79">the dangerous weaponry and information</text>
  <text start="194.44" dur="3.81">is the most dangerous one of all so just</text>
  <text start="196.57" dur="5.61">a quick point to make about</text>
  <text start="198.25" dur="5.37">and it&amp;#39;s kind of important especially if</text>
  <text start="202.18" dur="3.87">you know they&amp;#39;re allowed to start doing</text>
  <text start="203.62" dur="4.53">business here and and people start</text>
  <text start="206.05" dur="6.24">buying the technology and especially if</text>
  <text start="208.15" dur="6.51">you&amp;#39;re involved in secret or classified</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="3.9">even kind of stuff you you know this is</text>
  <text start="214.66" dur="5.73">a potential threat to our country</text>
  <text start="216.19" dur="7.92">now speaking of China this trade war has</text>
  <text start="220.39" dur="5.25">certain rules imposed on even Trump by</text>
  <text start="224.11" dur="4.98">the World Trade Organization</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="5.55">however Trump is sort of in a position</text>
  <text start="229.09" dur="3.93">of veto here and he&amp;#39;s using it quite a</text>
  <text start="231.19" dur="4.59">bit and he has been for a while and in</text>
  <text start="233.02" dur="5.01">fact the appeals court which could</text>
  <text start="235.78" dur="4.08">potentially kind of neuter some of the</text>
  <text start="238.03" dur="3.81">tariffs that he would do their more</text>
  <text start="239.86" dur="3.45">strenuous like the some of the bigger</text>
  <text start="241.84" dur="3.06">guns that he could bring out and they</text>
  <text start="243.31" dur="3.45">might say oh you can&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="244.9" dur="3.87">well that Court is basically neutered</text>
  <text start="246.76" dur="4.41">they can&amp;#39;t do anything they&amp;#39;re almost</text>
  <text start="248.77" dur="3.96">out of time in terms of even having</text>
  <text start="251.17" dur="4.89">enough judges and he can block new</text>
  <text start="252.73" dur="6.599">judges so he&amp;#39;s free he&amp;#39;s nullifying the</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="6.78">court basically making it de facto de</text>
  <text start="259.329" dur="7.771">facto useless or defunct at least until</text>
  <text start="262.84" dur="6.96">he&amp;#39;s done blocking it so this would</text>
  <text start="267.1" dur="5.25">allow him to then ramp up even bigger</text>
  <text start="269.8" dur="4.2">tariffs on people like China so while</text>
  <text start="272.35" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re talking about China and any other</text>
  <text start="274" dur="4.95">nation you know that the deep state</text>
  <text start="276.85" dur="5.04">cabal of the World Trade Organization</text>
  <text start="278.95" dur="5.4">and the you want to and the UN and NATO</text>
  <text start="281.89" dur="6.41">and all these groups which are all</text>
  <text start="284.35" dur="7.35">pretty co-opted want to to push on this</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="6.25">so we also have Lindsey Graham saying no</text>
  <text start="291.7" dur="5.01">witnesses to Senate hearings he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="3.75">basically giving people a pass that have</text>
  <text start="296.71" dur="2.97">committed all of this treasonous acts</text>
  <text start="298.3" dur="3.84">against our president to try to</text>
  <text start="299.68" dur="4.23">maliciously go after him he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.14" dur="3.029">letting them off the hook saying that he</text>
  <text start="303.91" dur="2.85">won&amp;#39;t call them in to grill them</text>
  <text start="305.169" dur="3.241">basically I mean what are we really</text>
  <text start="306.76" dur="3.45">looking at here is ask them some</text>
  <text start="308.41" dur="3.42">questions right let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s get them on</text>
  <text start="310.21" dur="3.57">the record let&amp;#39;s get them under oath</text>
  <text start="311.83" dur="3.99">even and ask them some questions know</text>
  <text start="313.78" dur="4.44">what do they have to worry about right</text>
  <text start="315.82" dur="4.59">unless they&amp;#39;ve broken some laws and</text>
  <text start="318.22" dur="4.65">unless they&amp;#39;ve unfairly targeted people</text>
  <text start="320.41" dur="4.77">and destroyed their lives like man</text>
  <text start="322.87" dur="4.95">afford like Roger stone like others who</text>
  <text start="325.18" dur="5.58">are now in some serious trouble because</text>
  <text start="327.82" dur="4.11">they were targeted but you know a double</text>
  <text start="330.76" dur="2.43">standard of course</text>
  <text start="331.93" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s the same people that committed the</text>
  <text start="333.19" dur="4.02">same crimes like Podesta or Clinton hey</text>
  <text start="335.83" dur="3.869">look they get away with it they get</text>
  <text start="337.21" dur="4.37">immunity deals for their staff even even</text>
  <text start="339.699" dur="7.381">their secretaries get immunity deals</text>
  <text start="341.58" dur="8.11">anyway it&amp;#39;s ridiculous now the the the</text>
  <text start="347.08" dur="5.55">drama of the last 24 hours is that</text>
  <text start="349.69" dur="5.46">Horowitz came out with his report and it</text>
  <text start="352.63" dur="5.58">was underwhelming and Comey immediately</text>
  <text start="355.15" dur="6.72">says I&amp;#39;m exonerated which is not true in</text>
  <text start="358.21" dur="5.22">Horowitz his own words but then people</text>
  <text start="361.87" dur="3.21">said well he&amp;#39;s letting him off the hook</text>
  <text start="363.43" dur="2.94">he&amp;#39;s not finding certain things and</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="3.78">remember he doesn&amp;#39;t have all of the</text>
  <text start="366.37" dur="4.74">information he&amp;#39;s not fully making all of</text>
  <text start="368.86" dur="4.02">the findings yet or anything like that</text>
  <text start="371.11" dur="4.44">he&amp;#39;s just giving some of the information</text>
  <text start="372.88" dur="5.25">and bar who has more of the information</text>
  <text start="375.55" dur="7.41">if not all of it himself comes out and</text>
  <text start="378.13" dur="6.629">says well actually you know he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="382.96" dur="4.29">have all of the information and in fact</text>
  <text start="384.759" dur="6.151">he&amp;#39;s wrong about some things and in fact</text>
  <text start="387.25" dur="4.889">this was spying but I am I actually went</text>
  <text start="390.91" dur="3.09">to the wrong article I just went off</text>
  <text start="392.139" dur="3.9">memory with that this article talks</text>
  <text start="394" dur="4.83">about FBI falsifying documents to</text>
  <text start="396.039" dur="4.62">continue spying on Trump after the</text>
  <text start="398.83" dur="5.72">election so this is important too and</text>
  <text start="400.659" dur="6.861">I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll play this clip here as well</text>
  <text start="404.55" dur="6.01">here we go</text>
  <text start="407.52" dur="5.1">so what do you think what questions will</text>
  <text start="410.56" dur="5.22">John Durham addressed that the IG didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="412.62" dur="5.89">well Durham is is looking at the whole</text>
  <text start="415.78" dur="6.69">waterfront he is looking at the issue of</text>
  <text start="418.51" dur="8.999">how it got started he&amp;#39;s looking at</text>
  <text start="422.47" dur="6.96">whether or not the narrative of Trump</text>
  <text start="427.509" dur="4.921">being involved in the Russian</text>
  <text start="429.43" dur="6.239">interference actually preceded July and</text>
  <text start="432.43" dur="6.69">was in fact the precipitating trigger</text>
  <text start="435.669" dur="5.821">for the investigation he&amp;#39;s also looking</text>
  <text start="439.12" dur="3.72">at the conduct of the investigation</text>
  <text start="441.49" dur="3.419">there are some things that were done in</text>
  <text start="442.84" dur="4.98">the investigation that are not included</text>
  <text start="444.909" dur="6.181">in horowitz&amp;#39;s report and he&amp;#39;s looking at</text>
  <text start="447.82" dur="5.61">those things but also a few weeks ago I</text>
  <text start="451.09" dur="3.9">told him that he should spend just as</text>
  <text start="453.43" dur="5.25">much attention on the post-election</text>
  <text start="454.99" dur="5.789">period and I did that because of some of</text>
  <text start="458.68" dur="4.32">the stuff that Horowitz has uncovered</text>
  <text start="460.779" dur="4.2">which to me is an explicit such</text>
  <text start="463" dur="2.46">applicable well what I said is their</text>
  <text start="464.979" dur="3.03">case</text>
  <text start="465.46" dur="4.26">elapsed after the election and they</text>
  <text start="468.009" dur="4.28">never told the court and they kept on</text>
  <text start="469.72" dur="5.49">getting renewals on these applications</text>
  <text start="472.289" dur="5.35">they those documents falsified in order</text>
  <text start="475.21" dur="5.79">to get these renewals there was all</text>
  <text start="477.639" dur="7.191">kinds of withholding of information from</text>
  <text start="481" dur="6.75">the court and the question really is</text>
  <text start="484.83" dur="4.54">what was the agenda after the election</text>
  <text start="487.75" dur="3.599">that kept them pressing ahead after</text>
  <text start="489.37" dur="5.07">their case collapsed this is the</text>
  <text start="491.349" dur="5.16">President of the United States you of</text>
  <text start="494.44" dur="4.319">course went to three countries with him</text>
  <text start="496.509" dur="3.72">why did you have to do that and some</text>
  <text start="498.759" dur="4.321">people have said well this is clearly</text>
  <text start="500.229" dur="5.521">bill bars in charge of the investigation</text>
  <text start="503.08" dur="7.11">well the presentation of that in the</text>
  <text start="505.75" dur="7.32">media has been silly the person running</text>
  <text start="510.19" dur="4.62">the investigation is John Durham but</text>
  <text start="513.07" dur="3.209">this is a very unusual circumstance</text>
  <text start="514.81" dur="3.75">where we are going to foreign</text>
  <text start="516.279" dur="4.62">governments and ask him to assist and</text>
  <text start="518.56" dur="4.56">cooperate including you know some of</text>
  <text start="520.899" dur="5.13">their sensitive materials and and</text>
  <text start="523.12" dur="5.55">personnel and a US attorney doesn&amp;#39;t show</text>
  <text start="526.029" dur="4.8">up on the doorstep in in some of these</text>
  <text start="528.67" dur="4.109">countries like London and say hey I want</text>
  <text start="530.829" dur="5.76">to talk to your intelligence people and</text>
  <text start="532.779" dur="6.481">so forth all the regularities were were</text>
  <text start="536.589" dur="5.31">followed I went through the empire my</text>
  <text start="539.26" dur="4.56">purpose was to introduce Durham to the</text>
  <text start="541.899" dur="3.18">appropriate people and set up a channel</text>
  <text start="543.82" dur="3.48">that he could work with these countries</text>
  <text start="545.079" dur="4.291">at the request of the country I went</text>
  <text start="547.3" dur="4.77">through the ambassador&amp;#39;s of each country</text>
  <text start="549.37" dur="5.279">and the government&amp;#39;s wanted to initially</text>
  <text start="552.07" dur="5.579">talk to me to find out what is this</text>
  <text start="554.649" dur="5.791">about what are the ground rules is this</text>
  <text start="557.649" dur="5.461">gonna be a criminal case are you going</text>
  <text start="560.44" dur="4.26">to you know do a public report they</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="3.51">wanted to understand the ground rules</text>
  <text start="564.7" dur="3.57">before they met with Durham and I met</text>
  <text start="566.62" dur="3.83">with him and then I set up appropriate</text>
  <text start="568.27" dur="3.99">channels this was perfectly appropriate</text>
  <text start="570.45" dur="3.28">speaking of whether something is</text>
  <text start="572.26" dur="3.54">appropriate or not was it appropriate</text>
  <text start="573.73" dur="4.32">for John Durham to issue his statement</text>
  <text start="575.8" dur="3.779">yesterday given that he&amp;#39;s the US</text>
  <text start="578.05" dur="3.84">attorney with the grand jury and his</text>
  <text start="579.579" dur="3.871">investigation isn&amp;#39;t done yet all right</text>
  <text start="581.89" dur="3.389">oh yeah I think it was definitely</text>
  <text start="583.45" dur="4.23">appropriate because I think it was it</text>
  <text start="585.279" dur="4.411">was necessary for avoid public confusion</text>
  <text start="587.68" dur="4.92">I think it was sort of being reported by</text>
  <text start="589.69" dur="5.009">the press that the issue of predication</text>
  <text start="592.6" dur="4.33">was sort of done and over even though it</text>
  <text start="594.699" dur="5.89">was a very limited look at that issue</text>
  <text start="596.93" dur="6.36">by the IG given the narrowness of his in</text>
  <text start="600.589" dur="4.351">you know of the evidence available to</text>
  <text start="603.29" dur="4.92">them and I think it was important for</text>
  <text start="604.94" dur="5.28">people to understand that the that you</text>
  <text start="608.21" dur="4.77">know Durham&amp;#39;s work was not being</text>
  <text start="610.22" dur="5.369">preempted and that Durham was doing</text>
  <text start="612.98" dur="4.89">something different and he explains what</text>
  <text start="615.589" dur="4.801">he&amp;#39;s doing different and that there are</text>
  <text start="617.87" dur="4.38">areas of disagreement I think was</text>
  <text start="620.39" dur="4.17">perfectly appropriate so the public</text>
  <text start="622.25" dur="5.25">understood the relationship between the</text>
  <text start="624.56" dur="4.5">two exercises and here&amp;#39;s the other video</text>
  <text start="627.5" dur="4.26">I was talking about where he actually</text>
  <text start="629.06" dur="4.29">refutes Horowitz and not like you know</text>
  <text start="631.76" dur="2.37">he&amp;#39;s lying or anything but more like you</text>
  <text start="633.35" dur="3.239">know he doesn&amp;#39;t have all the information</text>
  <text start="634.13" dur="4.86">and he hasn&amp;#39;t fully got all the data</text>
  <text start="636.589" dur="4.681">here so it&amp;#39;s not I&amp;#39;m not saying Horowitz</text>
  <text start="638.99" dur="4.11">is a bad guy or he&amp;#39;s been co-opted or</text>
  <text start="641.27" dur="4.23">anything by the deep state I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="643.1" dur="4.77">saying that the report while it has some</text>
  <text start="645.5" dur="4.98">legitimate bombshells in there and it</text>
  <text start="647.87" dur="5.76">does implicate deception lies and even</text>
  <text start="650.48" dur="6.69">crimes the report is just one small</text>
  <text start="653.63" dur="5.07">piece of what&amp;#39;s coming with Huber so I</text>
  <text start="657.17" dur="3.169">just wanted to let you know and then</text>
  <text start="658.7" dur="6.27">I&amp;#39;ll let you see the video here we go</text>
  <text start="660.339" dur="7.841">could find no documentary or testimonial</text>
  <text start="664.97" dur="6.15">evidence of political bias and while</text>
  <text start="668.18" dur="7.31">almost two years of investigation in the</text>
  <text start="671.12" dur="7.86">FBI probe of the 2016 Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="675.49" dur="6.67">these irregularities these misstatements</text>
  <text start="678.98" dur="6.84">these omissions were not satisfactorily</text>
  <text start="682.16" dur="6.869">explained and I think that leaves open</text>
  <text start="685.82" dur="6.48">the possibility to infer bad faith all</text>
  <text start="689.029" dur="5.821">he said is people gave me an explanation</text>
  <text start="692.3" dur="4.38">and I didn&amp;#39;t find anything to contradict</text>
  <text start="694.85" dur="4.979">it so I don&amp;#39;t have a basis for saying</text>
  <text start="696.68" dur="5.64">that there was improper motive but he</text>
  <text start="699.829" dur="7.2">hasn&amp;#39;t decided the issue of improper</text>

  <text start="713.779" dur="5.401">upon thoroughly spider part I mean</text>
  <text start="717.17" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s what electronic surveillance is I</text>
  <text start="719.18" dur="4.23">think wiring people up to go in and talk</text>
  <text start="721.64" dur="4.41">to people and make recordings of their</text>
  <text start="723.41" dur="4.799">conversations is spying I think our</text>
  <text start="726.05" dur="4.09">nation was turned on its head for three</text>
  <text start="728.209" dur="5.091">years</text>
  <text start="730.14" dur="6.88">based on a completely bogus narrative</text>
  <text start="733.3" dur="6.24">that was largely flam fanned and hyped</text>
  <text start="737.02" dur="5.55">by an irresponsible press the question</text>
  <text start="739.54" dur="4.62">really is what was the agenda after the</text>
  <text start="742.57" dur="4.04">election that kept them pressing ahead</text>
  <text start="744.16" dur="5.43">after their case collapsed</text>
  <text start="746.61" dur="6.13">now here do nothing Lindsey Graham asked</text>
  <text start="749.59" dur="5.04">Horowitz about come--and whether or not</text>
  <text start="752.74" dur="3.39">his report actually vindicates him</text>
  <text start="754.63" dur="3.03">because you know Comey is out there</text>
  <text start="756.13" dur="4.52">saying well it looks like I&amp;#39;m vindicated</text>
  <text start="757.66" dur="6.54">haha you know being as usual you know</text>
  <text start="760.65" dur="7.12">holier-than-thou self-righteous you know</text>
  <text start="764.2" dur="5.82">persona but Horowitz sets that very</text>
  <text start="767.77" dur="4.02">straight and says that he doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="770.02" dur="5.21">anybody who touched this as vindicated</text>
  <text start="771.79" dur="5.69">so here&amp;#39;s the interaction</text>
  <text start="775.23" dur="5.16">and is that a fair assessment of your</text>
  <text start="777.48" dur="5.67">former FBI director James Comey said</text>
  <text start="780.39" dur="4.53">this week and that your report</text>
  <text start="783.15" dur="5.16">vindicates him is that a fair assessment</text>
  <text start="784.92" dur="5.46">of your report you know I think the</text>
  <text start="788.31" dur="7.89">activities we found here don&amp;#39;t indicate</text>
  <text start="790.38" dur="7.65">anybody who touched this less yeah so I</text>
  <text start="796.2" dur="3.75">want to you know he becomes quite a</text>
  <text start="798.03" dur="5.7">little mouse doesn&amp;#39;t he when he starts</text>
  <text start="799.95" dur="5.79">talking about actual like justice things</text>
  <text start="803.73" dur="4.26">when he starts going after people it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="805.74" dur="4.62">all great when he&amp;#39;s just in front of the</text>
  <text start="807.99" dur="3.84">cameras and trying to get I guess</text>
  <text start="810.36" dur="3.54">brownie points you know he&amp;#39;s a he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="811.83" dur="4.05">great speaker he&amp;#39;s a very passionate and</text>
  <text start="813.9" dur="3.42">he says all the right things but he</text>
  <text start="815.88" dur="5.43">never seems to be there when you need</text>
  <text start="817.32" dur="6.03">the results like calling people for you</text>
  <text start="821.31" dur="5.46">know toe to testify in front of the</text>
  <text start="823.35" dur="6.09">Senate over this this impeachment Fiasco</text>
  <text start="826.77" dur="4.56">in the house so he&amp;#39;s refusing he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="829.44" dur="4.5">want to call anyone even chef he wants</text>
  <text start="831.33" dur="3.54">to just let them off the hook not put</text>
  <text start="833.94" dur="2.67">them under oath and ask them questions</text>
  <text start="834.87" dur="3.99">and then let them get away with all of</text>
  <text start="836.61" dur="5.1">this that they&amp;#39;ve done and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="838.86" dur="5.28">Lindsey Graham but now he he seems</text>
  <text start="841.71" dur="4.08">furtive and small in a way because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="844.14" dur="4.35">actually going to ask questions about</text>
  <text start="845.79" dur="4.44">someone so I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m just not</text>
  <text start="848.49" dur="5.52">happy with him lately and maybe I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="850.23" dur="6.66">reading too much into it so we also have</text>
  <text start="854.01" dur="5.01">the deep state DOJ telling Judicial</text>

  <text start="897.27" dur="7.53">secure Trump warrants Wow</text>
  <text start="900.23" dur="6.61">so Durham is the hammer here I think</text>
  <text start="904.8" dur="3.54">he&amp;#39;s the one it&amp;#39;s gonna be the silent</text>
  <text start="906.84" dur="2.249">executioner he&amp;#39;s been working very</text>
  <text start="908.34" dur="3.03">diligently</text>
  <text start="909.089" dur="4.98">on the scene with a team of hundred or</text>
  <text start="911.37" dur="4.8">more maybe hundreds at this point of</text>

  <text start="916.17" dur="5.639">agents to investigate this massive ring</text>
  <text start="919.949" dur="4.531">of corruption I mean it&amp;#39;s truly a global</text>
  <text start="921.809" dur="5.311">but the very least the deep state ring</text>
  <text start="924.48" dur="4.079">of corruption and he&amp;#39;s been at it for</text>
  <text start="927.12" dur="3.629">quite a while now and that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="928.559" dur="4.111">getting really nervous and having things</text>
  <text start="930.749" dur="4.231">like this impeachment Fiasco where they</text>
  <text start="932.67" dur="5.43">make it up as they go with no evidence</text>
  <text start="934.98" dur="5.969">whatsoever because they are freaking out</text>
  <text start="938.1" dur="4.589">panicking so it&amp;#39;s not a surprise to see</text>
  <text start="940.949" dur="3.24">that the FBI schemed to purchase</text>
  <text start="942.689" dur="4.89">manufacture pay a lot of money for</text>
  <text start="944.189" dur="6.65">things like the dossier there now we</text>
  <text start="947.579" dur="6.151">also have Trump saying that he will</text>
  <text start="950.839" dur="7.24">fight this in the Senate and he will</text>
  <text start="953.73" dur="5.519">address this false charge of well I</text>
  <text start="958.079" dur="3.211">don&amp;#39;t even know what the charge is</text>
  <text start="959.249" dur="4.26">frankly they don&amp;#39;t really have a charge</text>
  <text start="961.29" dur="4.82">they first it was bribery but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="963.509" dur="5.25">think that&amp;#39;s actually in the impeachment</text>
  <text start="966.11" dur="5.32">paperwork and they just seemed to be</text>
  <text start="968.759" dur="5.791">going after corruption I guess and and</text>
  <text start="971.43" dur="5.159">that would be resisting their corrupt</text>
  <text start="974.55" dur="3.779">investigation or whatever it may be they</text>
  <text start="976.589" dur="4.98">don&amp;#39;t really seem to have much to go</text>
  <text start="978.329" dur="5.42">after now the IG report also confirming</text>
