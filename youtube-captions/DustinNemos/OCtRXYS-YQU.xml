  <text start="164.03" dur="5.22">the government to hand over the</text>
  <text start="165.86" dur="6.39">unredacted Rosenstein memo detailing the</text>
  <text start="169.25" dur="4.23">scope of Miller&amp;#39;s investigation this is</text>
  <text start="172.25" dur="2.73">what we one of the things we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="173.48" dur="3.96">trying to get for a while they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="174.98" dur="4.83">blocking it now the judge is ordering it</text>
  <text start="177.44" dur="5.07">to be released he also lost his temper</text>
  <text start="179.81" dur="5.13">Friday in a in the hearing over the</text>
  <text start="182.51" dur="4.85">metaphor issue and accused emile hirsch</text>
  <text start="184.94" dur="5.4">prosecutors of using the case against</text>
  <text start="187.36" dur="5.95">man afford to oust the president from</text>
  <text start="190.34" dur="5.07">office so the judge is pretty woke and</text>
  <text start="193.31" dur="4.26">it doesn&amp;#39;t even stop there he also</text>
  <text start="195.41" dur="5.25">blasts the Miller special counsel on</text>
  <text start="197.57" dur="6.72">lawless quote unfettered a power end</text>
  <text start="200.66" dur="6.54">quote and some are even saying that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="204.29" dur="6.33">he&amp;#39;s mulling over dismissal in this case</text>
  <text start="207.2" dur="10.16">and he has sharply questioned the mana</text>
  <text start="210.62" dur="10.92">for charges and Miller overreach and the</text>
  <text start="217.36" dur="7.57">C Trump actually and this is kind of a</text>
  <text start="221.54" dur="6">long shot I wish kind of situation but</text>
  <text start="224.93" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s worth mentioning one article says</text>
  <text start="227.54" dur="5.61">that Trump is considering disbanding or</text>

  <text start="235.88" dur="5.49">might be a lost ship</text>
  <text start="237.95" dur="5.1">I think gutting is far more likely than</text>
  <text start="241.37" dur="3.96">disbanding just because of the way the</text>
  <text start="243.05" dur="4.65">world is getting rid of all of these</text>
  <text start="245.33" dur="4.01">three-letter agencies would be about the</text>

  <text start="304.89" dur="6.18">dirt and Clinton&amp;#39;s one of the former was</text>

  <text start="328.49" dur="7.57">silenced you know a little email or or</text>
  <text start="332.67" dur="5.16">maybe there&amp;#39;s more to it and the fetus</text>

  <text start="357.84" dur="3.78">looks just like Bill Clinton but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="359.31" dur="4.95">kind of he&amp;#39;s mixed black and white and</text>
  <text start="361.62" dur="5.27">he&amp;#39;s making the rounds and yeah you</text>
  <text start="364.26" dur="6.5">could tell she&amp;#39;s looking at the kid and</text>

  <text start="386.009" dur="5.261">wouldn&amp;#39;t that be awesome and I want to I</text>
  <text start="388.9" dur="4.47">want to give gun rights back to the</text>
  <text start="391.27" dur="3.63">everybody I mean just completely because</text>

  <text start="397.09" dur="8.76">infringed this is the quote but yeah</text>
  <text start="403.66" dur="4.77">this is interesting I live in New</text>
  <text start="405.85" dur="4.17">Hampshire the Live Free or Die State but</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="4.709">even here I mean the laws are just so</text>
  <text start="410.02" dur="6.81">oppressive I moved here to get away from</text>
  <text start="413.139" dur="6.09">even more oppressive laws but you know</text>
  <text start="416.83" dur="5.76">there&amp;#39;s no great options in the US</text>
  <text start="419.229" dur="5.25">anymore it&amp;#39;s pretty much it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="422.59" dur="3.84">much all bad and that former</text>
  <text start="424.479" dur="3.901">decentralized all this deep all the</text>
  <text start="426.43" dur="4.44">states have to kind of sort of like a</text>
  <text start="428.38" dur="5.28">business with employees they have to</text>
  <text start="430.87" dur="4.53">sort of compete for the people because</text>
  <text start="433.66" dur="3.81">people could freely travel one of our</text>
  <text start="435.4" dur="4.29">other constitutional rights so if you</text>
  <text start="437.47" dur="3.99">had a bad state just go somewhere else</text>
  <text start="439.69" dur="4.17">and then they lose all the revenue and</text>
  <text start="441.46" dur="6.929">taxes and support and population</text>
  <text start="443.86" dur="8.22">everything else so carrying that line of</text>
  <text start="448.389" dur="6.27">thought decentralized competition kind</text>
  <text start="452.08" dur="6.6">of like a free market concept kind of a</text>
  <text start="454.659" dur="5.88">capitalist principle versus now when we</text>
  <text start="458.68" dur="6.84">have a much stronger centralized federal</text>
  <text start="460.539" dur="8.491">Big Brother central government so even</text>
  <text start="465.52" dur="5.31">even in a government system which is not</text>
  <text start="469.03" dur="4.139">a capitalist capitalist system I would</text>
  <text start="470.83" dur="6.149">argue that like rothbard says they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="473.169" dur="6.99">basically completely oxymoronic you know</text>
  <text start="476.979" dur="5.521">they don&amp;#39;t go together at all you cannot</text>
  <text start="480.159" dur="8.151">have true capitalism with with the</text>
  <text start="482.5" dur="5.81">government you can have partial but</text>
  <text start="488.5" dur="5.49">just like in the free market when</text>
  <text start="490.72" dur="5.31">competition creates quality same thing</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="4.35">with the states having all these</text>
  <text start="496.03" dur="4.58">different competitions between the</text>
  <text start="498.34" dur="5.64">states keeps taxes down and keeps</text>
  <text start="500.61" dur="5.14">services up it keeps corruption a little</text>
  <text start="503.98" dur="7.98">bit lower it did it&amp;#39;s great in a lot of</text>

  <text start="680.14" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t like the taste of avocado oil</text>
  <text start="683.26" dur="3.27">myself</text>
  <text start="684.25" dur="4.26">so and you can&amp;#39;t give it to dogs and</text>
  <text start="686.53" dur="7.02">cats because it&amp;#39;s toxic to to dogs and</text>
  <text start="688.51" dur="7.23">cats but you know there&amp;#39;s that coconut</text>
  <text start="693.55" dur="6.63">oil would be my favorite choice because</text>
  <text start="695.74" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s super healthy and very absorbable</text>
  <text start="700.18" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s good you know</text>
