  <text start="206" dur="5.819">keep the lines of communications open as</text>
  <text start="208.67" dur="4.469">much as we can that&amp;#39;s why the</text>

  <text start="240.45" dur="5.1">promotion of the ideals of tolerance and</text>
  <text start="242.67" dur="7.14">interfaith dialogue inspired by</text>
  <text start="245.55" dur="6.75">Fethullah Gulen in his transnational</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="5.179">social movement you do it through your</text>
  <text start="252.3" dur="2.689">everyday lives</text>
  <text start="255.36" dur="4.98">there you have it Fethullah Gulen</text>
  <text start="257.93" dur="5.89">alright so here we have another quote</text>
  <text start="260.34" dur="5.82">from Flynn Gulen portrays himself as a</text>
  <text start="263.82" dur="4.29">moderate but he is in fact a radical</text>
  <text start="266.16" dur="4.23">Islamist he has publicly boasted about</text>
  <text start="268.11" dur="4.98">his soldiers waiting for his orders to</text>
  <text start="270.39" dur="4.92">do whatever he directs them to do if he</text>
  <text start="273.09" dur="4.77">were in reality a moderate he would not</text>
  <text start="275.31" dur="5.13">be an exile nor would he exact the</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="5.04">Animus excite the animus of recept ie</text>
  <text start="280.44" dur="5.67">our Diwan or his government</text>
  <text start="282.9" dur="5.1">so of course rwan leader of Turkey is</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="4.92">not too happy with this guy and</text>
  <text start="288" dur="5.43">apparently that&amp;#39;s because Gulen had</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="5.16">attempted a coup in Turkey and this guy</text>
  <text start="293.43" dur="5.07">is a he&amp;#39;s a major political terrorist</text>
  <text start="296.19" dur="4.38">and he&amp;#39;s in exile from Turkey so they</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="4.98">want him and he&amp;#39;s hiding out here in the</text>
  <text start="300.57" dur="5.27">US where we the kacct the taxpayer are</text>
  <text start="303.48" dur="5.04">paying for him and his hundreds of</text>
  <text start="305.84" dur="6.04">indoctrination boot camp Muslim and you</text>
  <text start="308.52" dur="5.07">know radical schools that then pay all</text>
  <text start="311.88" dur="3.66">of these English teachers for example</text>
  <text start="313.59" dur="3.66">that probably don&amp;#39;t speak English to</text>
  <text start="315.54" dur="4.83">come into the country with visas more</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="5.669">than I think Google received and then of</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="5.19">course most of their money goes back to</text>
  <text start="322.919" dur="4.651">fool on they donate it back in from</text>
  <text start="325.56" dur="3.87">their income and then he donates a good</text>
  <text start="327.57" dur="4.74">portion of that to the Clintons so all</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="4.26">of this just led up to today and then</text>
  <text start="332.31" dur="1.65">you know there&amp;#39;s even more to it than</text>
  <text start="333.69" dur="2.76">that</text>
  <text start="333.96" dur="4.62">and then of course general Flynn is</text>
  <text start="336.45" dur="3.99">vindicated in a sense because rwan</text>
  <text start="338.58" dur="3.72">actually brought some paperwork and some</text>
  <text start="340.44" dur="4.32">documents and then talked about it</text>
  <text start="342.3" dur="5.25">publicly basically I just dropped off</text>
  <text start="344.76" dur="6.51">Trump with some documents on Fethullah</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="5.34">Gulen very interesting situation isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="351.27" dur="2.7">it that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a unique one right</text>
  <text start="352.89" dur="2.76">there</text>
  <text start="353.97" dur="4.29">let&amp;#39;s see what else and I want to talk</text>
  <text start="355.65" dur="5.16">to you guys about today there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>

  <text start="421.43" dur="6.209">fantasy has always been so like vital to</text>
  <text start="424.639" dur="5.46">me because as a non-binary person it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="427.639" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s a way of escaping the confines of</text>
  <text start="430.099" dur="4.41">the world we live in right it&amp;#39;s the way</text>
  <text start="432.259" dur="4.5">of building other realities and</text>
  <text start="434.509" dur="4.081">imagining the world as it could be not</text>
  <text start="436.759" dur="5.16">as it is having non binary</text>
  <text start="438.59" dur="5.69">representation in animated shows for</text>
  <text start="441.919" dur="4.641">young folks it&amp;#39;s just so vital because</text>
  <text start="444.28" dur="5.139">young people today are already</text>
  <text start="446.56" dur="4.84">understanding that gender is diverse and</text>
  <text start="449.419" dur="4.56">a broad spectrum from a super early age</text>
  <text start="451.4" dur="3.96">right so it&amp;#39;s about time that the shows</text>
  <text start="453.979" dur="3.241">that we&amp;#39;re making for young people</text>
  <text start="455.36" dur="3.57">reflect the world as they understand it</text>

  <text start="458.93" dur="3.829">double-trouble live up to their namesake</text>
  <text start="465.77" dur="5.549">anyway I don&amp;#39;t know if this is like a an</text>
  <text start="469.22" dur="5.099">anime thing or a transgender thing I</text>
  <text start="471.319" dur="5.521">anyway it&amp;#39;s a weird weird situation the</text>
  <text start="474.319" dur="4.141">problem here is not that it is making</text>
  <text start="476.84" dur="3.78">personal choices and I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="478.46" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s a he or she or or in it or they or</text>
  <text start="480.62" dur="4.109">a Z or whatever the problem is that</text>
  <text start="482.75" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re trying to indoctrinate shoulder</text>
  <text start="484.729" dur="3.181">being open about it trying to</text>
  <text start="485.93" dur="4.65">indoctrinate children toward this</text>
  <text start="487.91" dur="4.349">genders arm fluid in multiple genders</text>
  <text start="490.58" dur="4.11">all this other nonsense it&amp;#39;s anti</text>
  <text start="492.259" dur="5.461">science it it&amp;#39;s been proven demonstrable</text>
  <text start="494.69" dur="5.099">false and beyond that transgenderism is</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="4.89">a mental disorder condition that leads</text>
  <text start="499.789" dur="4.651">to about 50% suicide rate and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="502.61" dur="3.809">getting better when we start doping up</text>
  <text start="504.44" dur="4.56">kids with gender blocking drugs and</text>
  <text start="506.419" dur="5.511">hormone drop and dropping blocking drugs</text>
  <text start="509" dur="6.27">and things like that remember recently</text>

  <text start="522.05" dur="4.409">make him into a girl when that wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="523.969" dur="5.49">the case and finally it got out to such</text>
  <text start="526.459" dur="5.041">a point through interviews on platforms</text>
  <text start="529.459" dur="4.681">much like this one where they were able</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="4.56">to get some justice and that child was</text>
  <text start="534.14" dur="3.75">safe but many others are not they end up</text>
  <text start="536.06" dur="3.81">like this crazy double trouble character</text>
  <text start="537.89" dur="4.439">trying to tell your children that there</text>
