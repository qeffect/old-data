  <text start="73.299" dur="5.721">again I actually had help fixing that</text>
  <text start="76.57" dur="2.45">this time</text>
  <text start="81.21" dur="3.51">family is great</text>
  <text start="87.57" dur="6.23">I actually had a social outing today and</text>
  <text start="89.82" dur="3.98">the baby was quiet the entire time</text>
  <text start="93.87" dur="2.06">you</text>
  <text start="98.02" dur="5.41">yeah I kind of agree with Thomas umber</text>
  <text start="100.82" dur="5.42">Jia they&amp;#39;re anti school hasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="103.43" dur="2.81">gone into hue</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="5.6">I don&amp;#39;t get it though</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="4.98">I just watched his video about it and</text>
  <text start="112.7" dur="7.15">you know if respectfully his argument</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="6.09">basically is just an opinion like what</text>
  <text start="119.85" dur="6.48">is the evidence that queue has changed</text>
  <text start="121.56" dur="5.97">into some other queue I mean if you ask</text>
  <text start="126.33" dur="3.569">him that he&amp;#39;ll just play isn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="4.82">obvious but that&amp;#39;s not really an</text>
  <text start="129.899" dur="2.451">argument</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="3.15">you</text>
  <text start="134.62" dur="3.83">you</text>
  <text start="136.41" dur="4.14">I think auntie school has a lot of</text>
  <text start="138.45" dur="4.74">respect for Alex Jones you know so do I</text>
  <text start="140.55" dur="4.53">but I think that&amp;#39;s what really threw him</text>
  <text start="143.19" dur="3.72">because soon he got really defensive of</text>
  <text start="145.08" dur="4.05">Alex and then just completely went</text>
  <text start="146.91" dur="6.38">antique you</text>
  <text start="149.13" dur="4.16">that&amp;#39;s how that seemed to evolve to me</text>
  <text start="159.54" dur="2.059">you</text>
  <text start="162.34" dur="7.86">I mean I didn&amp;#39;t take Infowars off my</text>
  <text start="166.06" dur="8.039">list of info sources when all this went</text>
  <text start="170.2" dur="5.64">down I just went with the nuance you</text>
  <text start="174.099" dur="4.591">know if Alex Jones says something right</text>
  <text start="175.84" dur="6.56">now that cute disagrees with I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="3.71">be a little suspect of Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="183.2" dur="3.98">he sold us a lot of good for the world</text>
  <text start="187.31" dur="2.06">you</text>
  <text start="192.35" dur="2.06">you</text>
  <text start="199.42" dur="5.77">Alex was a little I am alex is he goes</text>
  <text start="203.27" dur="5.58">pretty big so he did seem a little</text>
  <text start="205.19" dur="6.14">jealous I don&amp;#39;t know I think there was a</text>
  <text start="208.85" dur="4.54">little bit of ego in there</text>
  <text start="211.33" dur="2.06">you</text>
  <text start="216.77" dur="5.22">I I did it I&amp;#39;m doing push-to-talk this</text>
  <text start="219.35" dur="6.33">week Laurie has let me know if I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="221.99" dur="6.38">it badly like the beginnings or the ends</text>
  <text start="225.68" dur="2.69">get cut off or something</text>
  <text start="229.08" dur="4.71">this will this way if like the dogs</text>
  <text start="231.39" dur="5.49">start barking or something I it&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="4.63">little easier to not bother you guys</text>
  <text start="236.88" dur="3.6">with it</text>
  <text start="238.42" dur="2.06">you</text>
  <text start="244.99" dur="2.06">you</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="7.591">oh you guys like the background noise</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="5.64">okay let me change it then hang on I</text>
  <text start="266.83" dur="3.8">think that&amp;#39;s a setting I can change</text>
  <text start="268.39" dur="2.24">easily</text>
  <text start="278.66" dur="2.06">you</text>
  <text start="289.069" dur="6.57">can you hear me now I didn&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="294.74" dur="6.59">there was that much of a background</text>
  <text start="295.639" dur="5.691">noise I have a air filter running but</text>
  <text start="308.37" dur="3.92">is this sound good someone says it</text>
  <text start="310.62" dur="7.95">sounds like a walkie-talkie</text>
  <text start="312.29" dur="9.599">okay so then Alex Jones and Corsi and</text>
  <text start="318.57" dur="8.129">David Seaman are all pretty staunchly</text>
  <text start="321.889" dur="6.101">vitriolic Lee against Q anti schools a</text>
  <text start="326.699" dur="3.75">little bit more polite about it but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="327.99" dur="7.399">he&amp;#39;s pretty much defending Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="330.449" dur="4.94">and and jumping to that team</text>
  <text start="344.45" dur="3.05">yeah so</text>
  <text start="347.849" dur="3.12">I think anti school is just defending</text>
  <text start="350.219" dur="4.29">Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="350.969" dur="6.48">I still see no our evidence for the</text>
  <text start="354.509" dur="4.77">argument there was that stuff that</text>
  <text start="357.449" dur="4.291">happened today with the post but you</text>
  <text start="359.279" dur="5.25">know these things have to be taken in</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="5.879">the context of a mastermind of all of</text>
  <text start="364.529" dur="5.76">this you know if he&amp;#39;s done all of this</text>
  <text start="367.619" dur="7.02">other stuff and and suddenly he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="370.289" dur="8.03">accidentally dropping his password come</text>
  <text start="374.639" dur="3.68">on this is intentional</text>
  <text start="381.49" dur="8.13">like that&amp;#39;s a good one Viking nuttier</text>
  <text start="385.46" dur="4.16">than a squirrel turd it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="391.23" dur="4.35">and yeah I mean there&amp;#39;s definitely some</text>
  <text start="393.54" dur="6.3">Zionism in course he&amp;#39;s closeted for sure</text>
  <text start="395.58" dur="8.67">he definitely supports his room its</text>
  <text start="399.84" dur="6.3">seemingly unquestioningly I even heard</text>
  <text start="404.25" dur="7.04">that the Pope is stepping now I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="406.14" dur="5.15">confirmed that yet it&amp;#39;s been busy day</text>
