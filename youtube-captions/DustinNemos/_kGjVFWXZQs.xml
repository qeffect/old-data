  <text start="44.82" dur="3.96">very appreciative of the opportunity and</text>
  <text start="47.01" dur="4.08">of course networking with other</text>
  <text start="48.78" dur="3.959">conservatives other people that classify</text>
  <text start="51.09" dur="3.03">themselves as constitutionalist</text>
  <text start="52.739" dur="5.041">libertarians and people like that</text>
  <text start="54.12" dur="5.939">prioritize the very important nature of</text>
  <text start="57.78" dur="3.959">our civil liberties for speech and all</text>
  <text start="60.059" dur="3.99">these things is absolutely imperative</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="3.511">not only in my personal work but in the</text>
  <text start="64.049" dur="3.211">work I think of everyone in the right</text>
  <text start="65.25" dur="3.9">wing and understanding how important it</text>
  <text start="67.26" dur="3.3">is to build those connections is such an</text>
  <text start="69.15" dur="3.75">imperative and what we&amp;#39;re attempting to</text>
  <text start="70.56" dur="3.809">achieve so as always I&amp;#39;m always</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="3.84">appreciative of these kind of</text>
  <text start="74.369" dur="3.721">opportunities and everything and for</text>
  <text start="76.74" dur="4.47">those who don&amp;#39;t know me I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="78.09" dur="4.56">involved in politics for about three or</text>
  <text start="81.21" dur="3.24">so years now so it&amp;#39;s actually been a</text>
  <text start="82.65" dur="3.829">relatively recent experience of mine but</text>
  <text start="84.45" dur="4.559">I found that my audience has been built</text>
  <text start="86.479" dur="4.511">relatively swiftly I&amp;#39;ve achieved about</text>
  <text start="89.009" dur="4.381">twenty five thousand followers on</text>
  <text start="90.99" dur="5.94">Facebook and like I said that was</text>
  <text start="93.39" dur="6.299">actually quite a surprising phenomenon</text>
  <text start="96.93" dur="4.77">is not something that I it was you know</text>
  <text start="99.689" dur="4.29">very surprising I did not just say that</text>
  <text start="101.7" dur="3.779">at all when I began expressing my</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="3.541">thoughts on politics and everything I</text>
  <text start="105.479" dur="5.03">actually began you know is more of a</text>
  <text start="107.52" dur="6.66">modernist interest and I found that the</text>
  <text start="110.509" dur="6.101">continually totalitarian nature of the</text>
  <text start="114.18" dur="3.75">left and their insistence upon the</text>
  <text start="116.61" dur="4.23">silencing those that they disagree with</text>
  <text start="117.93" dur="5.189">began to essentially cultivated my own</text>
  <text start="120.84" dur="3.989">perspectives a more right-wing leaning</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="3.96">perspective of course that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="124.829" dur="4.471">developed into where I am now and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="127.079" dur="4.321">you know censorship is essentially the</text>
  <text start="129.3" dur="3.51">integral part of my own philosophy and</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="1.949">my own work and discussing the</text>
  <text start="132.81" dur="2.759">affordance</text>
  <text start="133.349" dur="4.59">of the pivotal points in history that</text>
  <text start="135.569" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re in right now and exactly what it</text>
  <text start="137.939" dur="4.17">is we are facing in terms of the</text>
  <text start="139.769" dur="3.991">ideological opposition that we see in</text>
  <text start="142.109" dur="4.11">the left and their insistence that</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="3.809">anyone dare had the audacity to think</text>
  <text start="146.219" dur="3.561">for themselves and disagree with them</text>
  <text start="147.569" dur="4.56">even if they&amp;#39;re not an explicitly</text>
  <text start="149.78" dur="5.17">right-wing or conservative thinker isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="152.129" dur="4.44">itself very astonishing to see so you</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="4.23">know it&amp;#39;s very interesting to see how my</text>
  <text start="156.569" dur="5.131">own philosophy has evolved over time but</text>
  <text start="159.18" dur="4.83">of course my own ideas you know are</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="3.59">primarily revolving around the ideas of</text>
  <text start="164.01" dur="4.53">American nationalism of</text>
  <text start="165.29" dur="5.619">constitutionalism of the ideas of the</text>
  <text start="168.54" dur="4.44">ideal libertarian Society that</text>
  <text start="170.909" dur="4.23">emphasizes the importance of personal</text>
  <text start="172.98" dur="3.689">autonomy state autonomy the</text>
  <text start="175.139" dur="2.761">decentralization of the federal</text>
  <text start="176.669" dur="3.54">government and all those sort of things</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="3.869">so all of my personal work goes into</text>
  <text start="180.209" dur="3.84">that and you know that&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="181.769" dur="5.22">hoping to expand upon with you as well</text>
  <text start="184.049" dur="5.37">so definitely wow we have quite a bit in</text>
  <text start="186.989" dur="3.84">common philosophically you know our</text>
  <text start="189.419" dur="4.591">agendas everything sort of lines up so</text>
  <text start="190.829" dur="6.06">that&amp;#39;s very cool and definitely gotta</text>
  <text start="194.01" dur="5.369">say you know admire your your dedication</text>
  <text start="196.889" dur="4.59">to philosophy and the idealism there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.379" dur="3.57">my little one in the background so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="201.479" dur="4.44">have all sorts of dogs and noises and</text>
  <text start="202.949" dur="5.731">such but anyway you know I&amp;#39;m impressed</text>
  <text start="205.919" dur="4.921">and I think that you have obviously a</text>
  <text start="208.68" dur="5.429">pretty sharp audience to shoot pretty</text>
  <text start="210.84" dur="6.179">sharp following and instant success it</text>
  <text start="214.109" dur="5.431">seems as so many in these days who tell</text>
  <text start="217.019" dur="4.261">the truth seem to achieve its it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="219.54" dur="5.159">almost as though there&amp;#39;s a demand for it</text>
  <text start="221.28" dur="4.799">out there or something anyway so you</text>
  <text start="224.699" dur="3.361">know we talked a bit about your</text>
  <text start="226.079" dur="3.84">background and such and and you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="228.06" dur="3.06">around the scene for a while you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="229.919" dur="3.06">your own following your own you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="5.13">established as an influencer you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="232.979" dur="4.921">your street cred so to speak so all of</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="3.239">that now kind of leads up to where we</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="3.839">are now we&amp;#39;re talking about censorship</text>
  <text start="239.489" dur="4.83">where do you see that going what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="241.739" dur="3.84">happening lately in the headlines you</text>
  <text start="244.319" dur="4.53">know obviously I&amp;#39;ve met the lawsuit we</text>
  <text start="245.579" dur="4.56">could talk about that but go ahead well</text>
  <text start="248.849" dur="3.48">you know there has just been so much</text>
  <text start="250.139" dur="4.65">going on in terms of censorship in terms</text>
  <text start="252.329" dur="5.551">of political events in general it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="254.789" dur="4.5">really terrifying to see actually how</text>
  <text start="257.88" dur="3.81">swiftly everything has been escalating</text>
  <text start="259.289" dur="4.591">in terms of social medias attempt to</text>
  <text start="261.69" dur="3.96">censor conservatives across the world</text>
  <text start="263.88" dur="2.91">you know this is not just something</text>
  <text start="265.65" dur="4.01">we&amp;#39;re experiencing here in the state</text>
  <text start="266.79" dur="5.1">but in Europe you see severity of how</text>
  <text start="269.66" dur="4.18">extensive the censorship has become even</text>
  <text start="271.89" dur="5.52">to the point of escalating to the point</text>
  <text start="273.84" dur="5.28">of physical arrest confrontation with</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="4.17">law enforcement and everything else as a</text>
  <text start="279.12" dur="4.23">direct result of people simply</text>
  <text start="281.58" dur="3.45">expressing ideas on the internet that</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="3.33">others don&amp;#39;t agree with that is utterly</text>
  <text start="285.03" dur="3.99">terrifying and what I&amp;#39;m attempting to</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="3.84">make known to people right now is that</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="3.18">this is something that could be an</text>
  <text start="290.52" dur="3.3">eventual consequence in the United</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="3.99">States if something is not done to stop</text>
  <text start="293.82" dur="4.5">it for a few examples you might have</text>
  <text start="296.19" dur="4.44">seen of course a lot of the prominent</text>
  <text start="298.32" dur="4.26">news about several major mainstream</text>
  <text start="300.63" dur="4.23">conservative thinkers being silenced</text>
  <text start="302.58" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s been a very common thing in the</text>
  <text start="304.86" dur="3.96">moderate any it&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="306.12" dur="4.92">increasingly normalized by the media</text>
  <text start="308.82" dur="4.41">because these people are literally</text>
  <text start="311.04" dur="4.47">guilty of hate speech which is of course</text>
  <text start="313.23" dur="4.14">nothing more than the subjective term</text>
  <text start="315.51" dur="3.42">that is utilized against conservatives</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="4.11">to simply silence anything the Left</text>
  <text start="318.93" dur="5.12">disagrees with even if nothing in it is</text>
  <text start="321.48" dur="5.82">an ameba wink taper from hateful yeah</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="4.78">you probably you know with Candice Owens</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="4.02">what happened with her recently she was</text>
  <text start="328.83" dur="5.85">banned for a week on Facebook for simply</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="5.85">discussing her own thoughts on what is</text>
  <text start="334.68" dur="4.11">you know creating problems within the</text>
  <text start="337.17" dur="2.85">black community in the United States she</text>
  <text start="338.79" dur="3.21">said I don&amp;#39;t believe that it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="3.6">sensationalized idea of white supremacy</text>
  <text start="342" dur="3.18">I think that it&amp;#39;s internal problems in</text>
  <text start="343.62" dur="3.9">the black community that is being feted</text>
  <text start="345.18" dur="4.17">by the Democrats you know which is the</text>
  <text start="347.52" dur="3.69">perpetuation of poverty of you know</text>
  <text start="349.35" dur="3.93">single-parent homes and that sort of</text>
  <text start="351.21" dur="4.53">thing that is you know my idea of what</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="5.58">is perpetuating problem Great Society</text>
  <text start="355.74" dur="4.68">context exactly and I told that she said</text>
  <text start="358.86" dur="3.45">and yet she was banned for seven days</text>
  <text start="360.42" dur="3.81">for that post and not only was she</text>
  <text start="362.31" dur="3.99">banned but it was actually revealed by</text>
  <text start="364.23" dur="4.56">an insider on Facebook that actually</text>
  <text start="366.3" dur="5.1">used to work for the corporation who was</text>
  <text start="368.79" dur="4.86">actually fired as a result of protesting</text>
  <text start="371.4" dur="3.9">Facebook&amp;#39;s intentional and deliberate</text>
  <text start="373.65" dur="4.5">scrim in addition against conservatives</text>
  <text start="375.3" dur="5.67">that Facebook actually has a blacklist</text>
  <text start="378.15" dur="7.08">that they have thousands and thousands</text>
  <text start="380.97" dur="7.17">of conservatives on and they produce as</text>
  <text start="385.23" dur="4.74">hate agents and candice owens was</text>
  <text start="388.14" dur="4.23">actually included on that list as a</text>
  <text start="389.97" dur="4.14">quote-unquote hate agent just absolutely</text>
  <text start="392.37" dur="3.99">preposterous in every sense of the word</text>
  <text start="394.11" dur="5.25">that is just astonishing to me the some</text>
  <text start="396.36" dur="4.29">women as moderate logical rational</text>
  <text start="399.36" dur="3.45">sensible</text>
  <text start="400.65" dur="4.23">and influential as she is that hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="402.81" dur="3.81">said in any way shape or form anything</text>
  <text start="404.88" dur="4.83">that can be misconstrued as emotionally</text>
  <text start="406.62" dur="4.59">volatile or hateful or suppressive could</text>
  <text start="409.71" dur="3.09">be deemed someone that is that</text>
  <text start="411.21" dur="3.75">quote-unquote agent of hate that is just</text>
  <text start="412.8" dur="5.1">utterly preposterous to me but of course</text>
  <text start="414.96" dur="4.2">you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not just confined and</text>
  <text start="417.9" dur="2.75">this is something she pointed out it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="419.16" dur="3.6">not just confined to these major</text>
  <text start="420.65" dur="4.6">conservative figures as well you know my</text>
  <text start="422.76" dur="4.59">audience is obviously much more small</text>
  <text start="425.25" dur="3.93">within hers you know but nevertheless</text>
  <text start="427.35" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s something that is influencing</text>
  <text start="429.18" dur="4.109">people across the world right now is</text>
  <text start="432.09" dur="2.73">something that everyone is starting to</text>
  <text start="433.289" dur="4.981">witness and say this is the problem and</text>
  <text start="434.82" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s becoming so severe that you can</text>
  <text start="438.27" dur="3.48">literally express any ideas any opinions</text>
  <text start="440.52" dur="2.76">to sit the left is going to disagree</text>
  <text start="441.75" dur="3.21">with it and you will experience all of</text>
  <text start="443.28" dur="3.38">these different types of bands and</text>
  <text start="444.96" dur="4.62">everything else in fact I actually</text>
  <text start="446.66" dur="4.03">filled it out for different forms to</text>
  <text start="449.58" dur="3.66">send in to the White House and my</text>
  <text start="450.69" dur="4.8">experiences personally with censorship</text>
  <text start="453.24" dur="4.5">which include having new accounts on</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="4.59">facebook permanently banned my third one</text>
  <text start="457.74" dur="4.02">that I&amp;#39;m on right now it&amp;#39;s actually on a</text>
  <text start="460.08" dur="3.45">seven-day ban that starts it today I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="461.76" dur="3.89">also been shadow bandage in addition to</text>
  <text start="463.53" dur="4.23">that my bandwidth has decreased as</text>
  <text start="465.65" dur="4.42">facebook has created a deliberate</text>
  <text start="467.76" dur="4.409">attempt to silence my own personal</text>
  <text start="470.07" dur="4.2">opinions and everything and drastically</text>
  <text start="472.169" dur="4.021">reducing my audience I&amp;#39;ve had two</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="3.45">accounts on medium shut down Twitter&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.19" dur="3.99">taking down my voice and YouTube removed</text>
  <text start="477.72" dur="4.98">a video that I did that is ironically</text>
  <text start="480.18" dur="4.859">called the death of free speech so this</text>
  <text start="482.7" dur="5.64">is a very real phenomenon and it will</text>
  <text start="485.039" dur="5.671">affect in entirety the right wing if</text>
  <text start="488.34" dur="5.16">something is not going to stop it but I</text>
  <text start="490.71" dur="4.829">think you know the most terrifying</text>
  <text start="493.5" dur="3.66">aspect of all this is actually some very</text>
  <text start="495.539" dur="4.41">recent news that I was reading about</text>
  <text start="497.16" dur="5.16">pretending to a fourteen-year-old girl</text>
  <text start="499.949" dur="4.201">who is a youtuber and you probably have</text>
  <text start="502.32" dur="5.61">heard about this she&amp;#39;s called soap and</text>
  <text start="504.15" dur="6.48">this girl&amp;#39;s only 14 years old she has an</text>
  <text start="507.93" dur="5.039">incredible self-awareness and an</text>
  <text start="510.63" dur="3.86">incredibly developed political opinion</text>
  <text start="512.969" dur="3.211">and of course that opinion is</text>
  <text start="514.49" dur="3.01">systematically being silenced because</text>
  <text start="516.18" dur="3.45">she&amp;#39;s on the right wing and she&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="517.5" dur="5.909">conservative and she had the audacity to</text>
  <text start="519.63" dur="6.87">make a video mocking the totalitarian</text>
  <text start="523.409" dur="5.281">regimes of Sharia law in Islam and she</text>
  <text start="526.5" dur="3.87">had the audacity to express news that</text>
  <text start="528.69" dur="4.47">are considered politically incorrect and</text>
  <text start="530.37" dur="3.85">this girl is 14 years old she&amp;#39;s not even</text>
  <text start="533.16" dur="4.93">out of high school yet</text>
  <text start="534.22" dur="5.94">and I&amp;#39;m so terrified of her they</text>
  <text start="538.09" dur="3.9">actually removed all her videos on</text>
  <text start="540.16" dur="3.33">YouTube pertaining to that but in</text>
  <text start="541.99" dur="3.93">addition to that she&amp;#39;s actually being</text>
  <text start="543.49" dur="4.41">subject to two police investigations and</text>
  <text start="545.92" dur="4.32">a protest at her local high school I</text>
  <text start="547.9" dur="5.34">sure would like to speak to her from my</text>
  <text start="550.24" dur="4.65">attorneys sake absolutely and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="553.24" dur="5.79">when you definitely should try to do</text>
  <text start="554.89" dur="6.75">because she&amp;#39;s just one out of millions a</text>
  <text start="559.03" dur="5.1">good case like that I mean that&amp;#39;s gold</text>
  <text start="561.64" dur="3.9">for the for the optics side of it I mean</text>
  <text start="564.13" dur="3.6">I told the really don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="565.54" dur="4.59">necessarily go after my case go after</text>
  <text start="567.73" dur="4.14">someone&amp;#39;s case go after a case that will</text>
  <text start="570.13" dur="5.37">win less let&amp;#39;s just find a way to win</text>
  <text start="571.87" dur="4.83">and to that degree so I told him I would</text>
  <text start="575.5" dur="3.21">cover that and I would bring him a</text>
  <text start="576.7" dur="3.45">movement of millions so sort of what we</text>
  <text start="578.71" dur="3.57">do about it you mentioned with</text>
  <text start="580.15" dur="3.87">censorship I think we just team up we</text>
  <text start="582.28" dur="3.39">have a big voice a lot of muscle a lot</text>
  <text start="584.02" dur="2.7">of weight to throw around that way kind</text>
  <text start="585.67" dur="5.25">of the where we go when we go all</text>
  <text start="586.72" dur="6.57">concept but you know what a I would love</text>
  <text start="590.92" dur="5.07">to help that girl Alan to throw her some</text>
  <text start="593.29" dur="3.78">defense or something and I&amp;#39;m sure Ernie</text>
  <text start="595.99" dur="3.45">would at least love to hear her story</text>
  <text start="597.07" dur="5.7">see what we could do maybe that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="599.44" dur="4.98">place to start who knows absolutely and</text>
  <text start="602.77" dur="3.99">you know the interesting thing about it</text>
  <text start="604.42" dur="5.34">is despite the aggressive attempts to</text>
  <text start="606.76" dur="5.13">silence her she actually had over 1</text>
  <text start="609.76" dur="4.71">million people subscribe to our channel</text>
  <text start="611.89" dur="4.56">on YouTube after that of it because you</text>
  <text start="614.47" dur="4.65">know this is an event that affects all</text>
  <text start="616.45" dur="4.68">Americans at some point and and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="619.12" dur="4.77">the interesting thing is that despite</text>
  <text start="621.13" dur="3.99">some people having not yet experienced</text>
  <text start="623.89" dur="3.69">this on a personal level they are</text>
  <text start="625.12" dur="3.87">personally infuriated by the fact that</text>
  <text start="627.58" dur="3.96">this is happening to people that they</text>
  <text start="628.99" dur="4.23">know people that they have similar</text>
  <text start="631.54" dur="3">political views to and even people have</text>
  <text start="633.22" dur="3.15">been disagree with they&amp;#39;re reaching</text>
  <text start="634.54" dur="3.63">across the aisle and saying you know</text>
  <text start="636.37" dur="3.81">there is something fundamentally wrong</text>
  <text start="638.17" dur="4.74">about is something that is fundamentally</text>
  <text start="640.18" dur="5.12">antithetical to American philosophy to</text>
  <text start="642.91" dur="4.35">constitutionality to personal liberty in</text>
  <text start="645.3" dur="4.06">silencing those simply because you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="647.26" dur="4.26">agree with them and criminalizing them</text>
  <text start="649.36" dur="3.84">and intentionally dehumanizing them and</text>
  <text start="651.52" dur="3.51">referring to them as all these</text>
  <text start="653.2" dur="3.51">derogatory terms and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="655.03" dur="4.05">since the very beginning we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="656.71" dur="5">labeled deplorable so we&amp;#39;ve been labeled</text>
  <text start="659.08" dur="6.09">bigots and misogynist and cysts and</text>
  <text start="661.71" dur="5.65">Islamophobic homophobic racist monsters</text>
  <text start="665.17" dur="4.68">that simply should not be warned</text>
  <text start="667.36" dur="3.77">did any Liberty to express our own ideas</text>
  <text start="669.85" dur="3.15">in terms of political discourse</text>
  <text start="671.13" dur="3.13">irrespective of how civil and</text>

  <text start="674.26" dur="3.96">demonized from the very beginning and</text>
  <text start="676.18" dur="4.589">all these things and when you start to</text>
  <text start="678.22" dur="4.83">realize all of the systemic oppression</text>
  <text start="680.769" dur="4.861">that is going on in terms of silencing</text>
  <text start="683.05" dur="5.13">conservative opinions you see a unity</text>
  <text start="685.63" dur="4.62">form between people and even people that</text>
  <text start="688.18" dur="4.02">are not necessarily conservative you see</text>
  <text start="690.25" dur="3.63">people start to come to this realization</text>
  <text start="692.2" dur="5.009">that hey this is something that has</text>
  <text start="693.88" dur="6.12">drastically that will eventually affect</text>
  <text start="697.209" dur="5.241">all of us and if on that basis it is</text>
  <text start="700" dur="4.68">necessary to unify do something about it</text>
  <text start="702.45" dur="3.85">yeah I think we need a roundtable</text>

  <text start="748.079" dur="4.541">to get the ball rolling and he has a</text>
  <text start="750.699" dur="4.291">couple of steps laid out I really want</text>
  <text start="752.62" dur="4.529">to figure out a sort of a non profit or</text>
  <text start="754.99" dur="4.08">a non profit or not-for-profit or</text>
  <text start="757.149" dur="4.081">something like that where people can can</text>

  <text start="761.23" dur="3.21">probably gonna be around two hundred</text>
  <text start="762.279" dur="3.661">thousand dollars before the appeal so</text>
  <text start="764.44" dur="4.29">who knows this wouldn&amp;#39;t cost millions</text>
  <text start="765.94" dur="4.86">but there are millions of Patriots out</text>
  <text start="768.73" dur="3.57">there I mean the energies there Trump is</text>

  <text start="774.67" dur="4.26">happening Project Veritas has given us</text>
  <text start="776.589" dur="3.18">all the evidence we need discovery will</text>
  <text start="778.93" dur="3.089">do the rest</text>
  <text start="779.769" dur="3.721">I mean all we have to do is bring in the</text>
  <text start="782.019" dur="2.611">engineers from the videos and project</text>
  <text start="783.49" dur="2.969">Veritas and it&amp;#39;s over</text>

  <text start="786.459" dur="4.291">so all we have to do at this point is</text>
  <text start="789.04" dur="4.2">just come together and build this</text>
  <text start="790.75" dur="3.839">movement and force this attorney down</text>
  <text start="793.24" dur="3.99">there throw it I&amp;#39;m already thinking of</text>

  <text start="824.32" dur="4.65">that because that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the beginning</text>
  <text start="826.03" dur="4.17">of our punch back you know we still have</text>
  <text start="828.97" dur="4.56">this problem to deal with obviously</text>
  <text start="830.2" dur="5.61">censorship in now D monetization</text>
  <text start="833.53" dur="3.9">inability to you know make ends meet for</text>
  <text start="835.81" dur="3.39">some of these youtubers inability to</text>
  <text start="837.43" dur="3.69">even get the word out for some of the</text>
  <text start="839.2" dur="4.38">others they&amp;#39;re just sort of pretending</text>
  <text start="841.12" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s not happening while it&amp;#39;s glaringly</text>
  <text start="843.58" dur="4.23">obvious to anyone who knows how to use</text>
  <text start="845.86" dur="4.41">the internet that it is indeed happening</text>
  <text start="847.81" dur="4.44">and you can in fact go and verify for</text>
  <text start="850.27" dur="4.29">yourself by doing things like comparing</text>
  <text start="852.25" dur="3.21">Google to go different search results</text>
  <text start="854.56" dur="1.86">for different terms that are</text>
  <text start="855.46" dur="3.33">controversial</text>
  <text start="856.42" dur="4.98">I still love Google for searching</text>
  <text start="858.79" dur="6.24">anything that people don&amp;#39;t disagree on</text>
  <text start="861.4" dur="6.69">you know but beyond that they&amp;#39;re evil</text>
  <text start="865.03" dur="5.22">and you can&amp;#39;t trust them now that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="868.09" dur="3.57">of my update I&amp;#39;ve been so far behind in</text>
  <text start="870.25" dur="2.91">the news I mean we&amp;#39;ve talked a little</text>
  <text start="871.66" dur="3.3">bit about censorship what else is going</text>
  <text start="873.16" dur="3.57">on I mean I know that there are some big</text>
  <text start="874.96" dur="3.54">happenings with bar and he&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="876.73" dur="3.68">dating back into the bad guys and</text>
  <text start="878.5" dur="4.85">actually getting to the bottom of things</text>
  <text start="880.41" dur="5.23">you know you want to speak to that any</text>
  <text start="883.35" dur="4.42">that&amp;#39;s been it&amp;#39;s been very interesting</text>
  <text start="885.64" dur="4.29">seeing the whole situation revolving</text>
  <text start="887.77" dur="3.63">around bar not only that situation but</text>
  <text start="889.93" dur="3.35">of course there been all of these</text>
  <text start="891.4" dur="3.57">various protests across the country</text>
  <text start="893.28" dur="3.13">regarding a lot of these different</text>
  <text start="894.97" dur="3.51">things and just goes to show to the</text>
  <text start="896.41" dur="4.02">extent that you know the left will</text>
  <text start="898.48" dur="3.36">literally do anything possible to</text>
  <text start="900.43" dur="3.12">attempt to demonize the right they will</text>
  <text start="901.84" dur="4.14">utilize whatever figures they can to</text>
  <text start="903.55" dur="4.2">accomplish that end and it&amp;#39;s not only on</text>
  <text start="905.98" dur="3.66">this particular issue but just across</text>
  <text start="907.75" dur="4.11">the board literally anything every time</text>
  <text start="909.64" dur="4.68">you throw the news which ideally they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="911.86" dur="5.72">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s more insistence on impeachment</text>
  <text start="914.32" dur="7.26">or things like that it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="917.58" dur="6.07">astonishing really and for every single</text>
  <text start="921.58" dur="3.87">reason imaginable even reasons that are</text>
  <text start="923.65" dur="3.69">fabricated it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s truly</text>
  <text start="925.45" dur="3.51">astonishing and honestly I think that</text>
  <text start="927.34" dur="4.14">because of that I think that because of</text>
  <text start="928.96" dur="4.2">all the logical opposition that the left</text>
  <text start="931.48" dur="2.88">is attempting to fabricate and were to</text>
  <text start="933.16" dur="2.7">demonize Trump</text>
  <text start="934.36" dur="4.38">really just solidifying his victory in</text>
  <text start="935.86" dur="5.099">2020 I really believe Shorty&amp;#39;s martyring</text>
  <text start="938.74" dur="4.409">their margarin him for it&amp;#39;s almost as</text>
  <text start="940.959" dur="3.991">though they were they were people on our</text>
  <text start="943.149" dur="3.06">side in there like Pelosi or somebody</text>
  <text start="944.95" dur="3.329">were just trying to destroy them on</text>
  <text start="946.209" dur="4.021">purpose or something I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="948.279" dur="4.261">they couldn&amp;#39;t get much worse at their</text>
  <text start="950.23" dur="3.27">strategy or much worse results than</text>
  <text start="952.54" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re getting they&amp;#39;re really just</text>
  <text start="953.5" dur="5.279">imploding themselves but you know other</text>
  <text start="956.62" dur="5.25">than that you know we&amp;#39;ve got some pretty</text>
  <text start="958.779" dur="4.56">big happenings obviously all the cue</text>
  <text start="961.87" dur="3.12">stuff sort of seems to be coming true</text>
  <text start="963.339" dur="4.141">for those who believe or not believe or</text>
  <text start="964.99" dur="4.2">whatever the cue movement is certainly</text>
  <text start="967.48" dur="3.21">worth following in terms of the</text>
  <text start="969.19" dur="6.089">coincidences at this point the evidence</text>
  <text start="970.69" dur="6.089">is quite astounding but do you want to</text>
  <text start="975.279" dur="2.821">by the way before we get off I know we</text>
  <text start="976.779" dur="3.451">were going to keep this short and kind</text>
  <text start="978.1" dur="4.109">of keep the attention span high for</text>
  <text start="980.23" dur="5.64">people but do you want to go ahead and</text>
  <text start="982.209" dur="6.031">announce kind of the the upcoming change</text>
  <text start="985.87" dur="6.87">that we were talking about as well or do</text>
  <text start="988.24" dur="6.24">you want to hold off on that which</text>
  <text start="992.74" dur="3.63">considering that is you know primarily</text>
  <text start="994.48" dur="6.69">your idea if you want I introduced that</text>

  <text start="1034.169" dur="4.77">there&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re sort of a team building</text>
  <text start="1035.699" dur="5.61">of Patriots and honest news people that</text>
