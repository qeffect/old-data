  <text start="122.969" dur="4.351">people he even talks about the crypto</text>
  <text start="125.1" dur="4.769">stuff and as a gold silver buyer I mean</text>
  <text start="127.32" dur="4.26">a gold silver seller AK would that would</text>
  <text start="129.869" dur="3.84">theoretically cost him money he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="131.58" dur="4.019">really making money if you buy Kryptos</text>

  <text start="145.019" dur="4.951">heart so you know I feel like I can</text>
  <text start="147.659" dur="4.89">safely vouch for him as far as a place</text>
  <text start="149.97" dur="4.439">to buy gold and silver from of course my</text>
  <text start="152.549" dur="3.39">opinion and his opinion by the way and</text>
  <text start="154.409" dur="3.72">and many other people&amp;#39;s opinion who are</text>
  <text start="155.939" dur="4.02">in the know is that silver is a much</text>
  <text start="158.129" dur="3.53">much much better deal I think silver is</text>
  <text start="159.959" dur="5.071">gonna do 400 percent of what gold does</text>
  <text start="161.659" dur="5.41">over the long term maybe even more and</text>
  <text start="165.03" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s not even including any kind of</text>
  <text start="167.069" dur="3.151">new technologies that come out that use</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="5">it that&amp;#39;s just going off of what we</text>
  <text start="170.22" dur="6.299">already have supply-demand use versus</text>
  <text start="173.45" dur="5.47">production capacity plus the fact that</text>
  <text start="176.519" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re trading 300 plus times what they</text>
  <text start="178.92" dur="5.55">actually have in physical as ETFs I mean</text>

  <text start="334.06" dur="4.259">end up in a situation where no one wants</text>
  <text start="335.919" dur="3.81">to let go their physical because every</text>
  <text start="338.319" dur="2.82">day it&amp;#39;ll probably keep getting more and</text>
  <text start="339.729" dur="2.791">more expensive you know and when you</text>
  <text start="341.139" dur="3.75">think it&amp;#39;s gonna be twice as much than a</text>

  <text start="349.33" dur="5.57">chaos I see something worse than the</text>
  <text start="352.479" dur="4.62">Great Depression coming and you know</text>
  <text start="354.9" dur="3.699">it&amp;#39;s worth mentioning that in the Great</text>
  <text start="357.099" dur="3.63">Depression most people still grow their</text>
  <text start="358.599" dur="3.961">own food and just think about the</text>
  <text start="360.729" dur="3.631">difference between the people then who</text>
  <text start="362.56" dur="4.349">had all of those skills living on the</text>
  <text start="364.36" dur="4.23">land growing up self-sufficient versus</text>
  <text start="366.909" dur="3.241">now people who barely can screw in a</text>
  <text start="368.59" dur="6.15">lightbulb em at least in my generation</text>
  <text start="370.15" dur="8.549">without help imagine the chaos that</text>
  <text start="374.74" dur="7.649">could happen if we get into a situation</text>
  <text start="378.699" dur="5.551">where people the stores are empty or</text>
  <text start="382.389" dur="4.231">there&amp;#39;s not enough food to go around or</text>
  <text start="384.25" dur="5.4">the supply chain which is very fragile</text>
  <text start="386.62" dur="4.56">is broken somehow I mean it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="389.65" dur="3.509">we can&amp;#39;t produce the food we need we can</text>
  <text start="391.18" dur="4.409">we can feed the world in just Texas</text>
  <text start="393.159" dur="6.51">it&amp;#39;s the supply chain is is just so</text>
  <text start="395.589" dur="5.47">fragile it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the manipulation and</text>
  <text start="399.669" dur="4.27">the</text>
  <text start="401.059" dur="4.771">the distortion in the markets through</text>
  <text start="403.939" dur="3.72">the subsidies and things like that the</text>

  <text start="407.659" dur="4.921">government funds are for un is taxpayer</text>
  <text start="410.539" dur="5.34">money things like that so I want people</text>
  <text start="412.58" dur="5.069">to be ready for this there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="415.879" dur="3.63">good things that you could go watch I</text>
  <text start="417.649" dur="3.36">mean there&amp;#39;s a bunch of new videos out</text>

  <text start="429.649" dur="4.02">understanding of how it works and what</text>
  <text start="431.029" dur="5.97">it is and why I think it&amp;#39;s a great thing</text>
  <text start="433.669" dur="4.95">I would also look at some I&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="436.999" dur="2.611">page of economic stuff and you can go</text>
