  <text start="2.669" dur="4.291">demos of Apex health club and I want to</text>
  <text start="5.43" dur="3.419">talk about see 60 people have been</text>
  <text start="6.96" dur="4.469">asking me so much in email that I</text>
  <text start="8.849" dur="4.231">thought I should make a video how do I</text>
  <text start="11.429" dur="4.08">take see 60 what do I do with it</text>
  <text start="13.08" dur="4.65">well I&amp;#39;ve even been asked do I put it in</text>
  <text start="15.509" dur="4.621">my eyes all these other questions so to</text>
  <text start="17.73" dur="3.69">put the record straight on for one of</text>
  <text start="20.13" dur="2.88">course I can&amp;#39;t give you any kind of</text>
  <text start="21.42" dur="4.26">specific dosing or anything like that</text>
  <text start="23.01" dur="5.759">but for me this is a food I mean this is</text>
  <text start="25.68" dur="5.07">oil and this is carbon it&amp;#39;s not exactly</text>
  <text start="28.769" dur="3.33">like some sort of pharmaceutical or</text>
  <text start="30.75" dur="3.239">anything like that we&amp;#39;re all made out of</text>
  <text start="32.099" dur="3.39">carbon anyway this special particular</text>
  <text start="33.989" dur="3.271">carbon has all sorts of unique</text>
  <text start="35.489" dur="3.121">interesting properties you know I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="37.26" dur="3.569">scroll through some in the background</text>
  <text start="38.61" dur="5.64">here and I&amp;#39;ve harped about the benefits</text>
  <text start="40.829" dur="4.591">of c60 forever you know back back before</text>
  <text start="44.25" dur="2.129">I even started selling I was just</text>
  <text start="45.42" dur="2.549">teaching people to make it for</text>
  <text start="46.379" dur="4.171">themselves because it&amp;#39;s so neat and</text>
  <text start="47.969" dur="4.951">interesting but let&amp;#39;s talk about how to</text>
  <text start="50.55" dur="3.96">use it when you get it the most popular</text>
  <text start="52.92" dur="3.36">type is the olive oil variety that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="54.51" dur="3.779">what was used in the rat study that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="56.28" dur="4.23">what made it so popular is is the</text>
  <text start="58.289" dur="4.02">doubling of lifespan for for mammals</text>
  <text start="60.51" dur="4.53">okay that was really interesting for</text>
  <text start="62.309" dur="5.461">humans too we haven&amp;#39;t seen that sort of</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="5.73">play out yet but the the early stage</text>
  <text start="67.77" dur="4.889">benefits I mean I do absolutely believe</text>
  <text start="70.77" dur="5.3">that doubling the human lifespan is</text>
  <text start="72.659" dur="6.301">possible with this particular carbon now</text>
  <text start="76.07" dur="5.11">back to the point olive oil is the most</text>
  <text start="78.96" dur="4.589">popular with that people tend to get it</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="4.71">in a vial or a dropper and that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="83.549" dur="4.531">you can do a drop or a day I personally</text>
  <text start="85.89" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t like the taste of a good quality</text>
  <text start="88.08" dur="3.539">olive oil by itself I like it</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="4.32">it says sort of a vinaigrette or</text>
  <text start="91.619" dur="4.981">something mixed in but by itself a good</text>
  <text start="94.71" dur="3.479">quality olive oil should be spicy in it</text>
  <text start="96.6" dur="4.379">you know if you like that kind of thing</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="4.741">great I just don&amp;#39;t like the flavor so I</text>
  <text start="100.979" dur="4.5">tend to do the coconut oil for myself</text>
  <text start="102.93" dur="5.13">but olive oil is wonderful it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="105.479" dur="4.5">wonderful even by itself for you and for</text>
  <text start="108.06" dur="4.32">longevity and for almost everything that</text>
  <text start="109.979" dur="4.981">ails you the problem with olive oil is</text>
  <text start="112.38" dur="4.86">that in that industry how ninety-five</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="5.9">percent of it is a ripoff a scam</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="7.229">just you know a rancid or adulterated or</text>
  <text start="120.86" dur="6.16">moldy even unfortunately there&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="124.469" dur="4.35">very few companies in the olive oil</text>
  <text start="127.02" dur="3.87">industry that are honest and there are</text>
  <text start="128.819" dur="3.771">some I source all of mine through the</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="3.29">California olive ranch</text>
  <text start="132.59" dur="2.81">which just had a bad year I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="134.18" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s about to get more expensive</text>
  <text start="135.4" dur="5.41">because of all of the fires and such but</text>
  <text start="137.93" dur="6.09">I source mine through there because they</text>
  <text start="140.81" dur="5.039">do have a vetted process and a good good</text>
  <text start="144.02" dur="2.939">tray and I remember the name of it off</text>
  <text start="145.849" dur="4.17">the top my head but a good trade</text>
  <text start="146.959" dur="4.86">industry seal of approval that that has</text>
  <text start="150.019" dur="5.011">good research and backing and reputation</text>
  <text start="151.819" dur="4.471">so there&amp;#39;s only a few companies that</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="3.5">have that out there so you have to be</text>
  <text start="156.29" dur="4.199">really careful it&amp;#39;s not the the usual</text>
  <text start="158.53" dur="3.73">popular brands that you&amp;#39;re gonna find</text>
  <text start="160.489" dur="3.75">although this brand you will find in</text>
  <text start="162.26" dur="5.55">most Walmart&amp;#39;s and grocery stores that</text>
  <text start="164.239" dur="5.761">I&amp;#39;ve seen so you know that&amp;#39;s one way of</text>
  <text start="167.81" dur="3.33">doing it you can just take a dropper you</text>
  <text start="170" dur="2.64">can put it in your food you can do</text>
  <text start="171.14" dur="4.89">anything that you would normally do with</text>
  <text start="172.64" dur="6.179">olive oil I don&amp;#39;t particularly like</text>
  <text start="176.03" dur="5.1">olive oil as a topical or external you</text>
  <text start="178.819" dur="4.051">could use it and I&amp;#39;m sure this the c60</text>
  <text start="181.13" dur="3.09">fullerenes which are so tiny they&amp;#39;ll go</text>
  <text start="182.87" dur="3.27">right through your skin</text>
  <text start="184.22" dur="3.989">I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;re still gonna get in but</text>
  <text start="186.14" dur="3.45">olive oil just leaves me feeling a</text>
  <text start="188.209" dur="3.331">little slimy and greasy</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="4.95">I feel like coconut oil absorbs better</text>
  <text start="191.54" dur="4.83">into my skin and I often use that anyway</text>
  <text start="194.54" dur="4.77">just for my hands and I like dry fingers</text>
  <text start="196.37" dur="5.04">and such and winter especially so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="199.31" dur="4.5">just come to prefer coconut oil for</text>
  <text start="201.41" dur="4.88">personal taste and and for topical or</text>
  <text start="203.81" dur="5.759">lotion uses or for like hair regrowth</text>
  <text start="206.29" dur="5.529">study showed 16% for that I don&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="209.569" dur="4.321">that first personally yet but if I were</text>
  <text start="211.819" dur="5.971">going to I would probably prefer coconut</text>
  <text start="213.89" dur="5.64">for that reason same with acne coconut</text>
  <text start="217.79" dur="3.539">just seems to work better as a lotion</text>
  <text start="219.53" dur="3.929">especially when it&amp;#39;s in its cold state</text>
  <text start="221.329" dur="4.44">people ask me about that a lot as well</text>
  <text start="223.459" dur="5.61">coconut kind of goes back and forth cold</text>
  <text start="225.769" dur="5.131">and solid obviously depending we found a</text>
  <text start="229.069" dur="3.781">very close temperature to human comfort</text>
  <text start="230.9" dur="4.05">levels so on any given day it can be</text>
  <text start="232.85" dur="4.109">back and forth 100 times which leaves</text>
  <text start="234.95" dur="4.14">all sorts of interesting variations I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="236.959" dur="4.081">seen it play out really beautifully</text>
  <text start="239.09" dur="3.929">actually I&amp;#39;ve seen some sometimes it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="241.04" dur="4.08">form a flat log sometimes it&amp;#39;ll form</text>
  <text start="243.019" dur="5.161">millions of little balls and they it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="245.12" dur="6.6">like little snow combs or something but</text>
  <text start="248.18" dur="6.66">so you can do topical I prefer coconut</text>
  <text start="251.72" dur="4.739">for topical but both would probably give</text>
  <text start="254.84" dur="2.91">you wonderful benefits I can&amp;#39;t claim</text>
  <text start="256.459" dur="2.881">benefits or anything like that and of</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="4.349">course the FDA isn&amp;#39;t evaluating this</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="4.02">public law but that&amp;#39;s kind of where we</text>
  <text start="262.099" dur="4.681">are now</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="5.39">I prefer honestly to just sort</text>
  <text start="266.78" dur="3.9">take the coconut oil and chase it with</text>
  <text start="268.75" dur="4.39">whatever I&amp;#39;m drinking because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="270.68" dur="4.11">usually an RA if I were to think it out</text>
  <text start="273.14" dur="3.5">a little bit better I would probably</text>
  <text start="274.79" dur="4.17">just put it in my smoothies or something</text>
  <text start="276.64" dur="4.24">but that&amp;#39;s kind of where I&amp;#39;m at I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="278.96" dur="3.45">sort of a rush these days and everything</text>
  <text start="280.88" dur="3.69">I just sort of chase it with water or</text>
  <text start="282.41" dur="4.44">take it you can mix it in with food it</text>
  <text start="284.57" dur="4.71">shouldn&amp;#39;t hurt anything like that is as</text>
  <text start="286.85" dur="4.83">of I&amp;#39;ve heard of nothing that concerns</text>
  <text start="289.28" dur="3.6">me as far as it taking from any sort of</text>
  <text start="291.68" dur="2.61">medicine like if you mix it with</text>
  <text start="292.88" dur="4.02">vitamins or medicine it doesn&amp;#39;t absorb</text>
  <text start="294.29" dur="4.83">those as far as I know but some people</text>
  <text start="296.9" dur="4.26">have raised the thought or the concern</text>
  <text start="299.12" dur="3.54">that maybe for taking it at the same</text>
  <text start="301.16" dur="4.02">time as something else it could</text>
  <text start="302.66" dur="4.26">potentially sort of pull in that - just</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="3.51">like it does some of the superoxides and</text>
  <text start="306.92" dur="5.15">some of the oxidative stress in your</text>
  <text start="308.69" dur="5.52">body so the free radicals and such so</text>
  <text start="312.07" dur="4.24">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really it it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="5.88">complicated at all just sort of a spoon</text>
  <text start="316.31" dur="6.15">or vial and you know to taste whatever</text>
  <text start="320.09" dur="4.38">your preference is you know whatever</text>
  <text start="322.46" dur="3.78">your skin type is maybe olive oil works</text>
  <text start="324.47" dur="4.2">better for your skin type for me I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="326.24" dur="4.77">usually pretty dry so coconut it does</text>
  <text start="328.67" dur="5.64">well for me and I enjoy that so um</text>
  <text start="331.01" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s it I think a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="334.31" dur="4.43">coming out with other products now that</text>
  <text start="335.93" dur="4.95">will you know do special things like</text>
  <text start="338.74" dur="3.97">specifically like a hair product and</text>
  <text start="340.88" dur="4.08">Japanese companies for for quite a while</text>
  <text start="342.71" dur="4.89">has had a sort of like cosmetic stuff</text>
  <text start="344.96" dur="4.43">out but really it&amp;#39;s just the c60 that</text>
  <text start="347.6" dur="3.54">has all of the claim to fame here and</text>
  <text start="349.39" dur="4.72">coconut oil is great for your skin</text>
  <text start="351.14" dur="5.52">anyway so I sort of see it as keep it</text>
  <text start="354.11" dur="5.63">honest keep it simple keep it as cheap</text>
  <text start="356.66" dur="6.57">as I can let people have the basic thing</text>
  <text start="359.74" dur="5.47">sort of how I like my holistic medicine</text>
  <text start="363.23" dur="3.93">anyway I like to keep it as simple and</text>
  <text start="365.21" dur="4.65">as close to nature as possible with as</text>
  <text start="367.16" dur="4.44">few ingredients as possible and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.86" dur="4.59">what you have here it&amp;#39;s just really good</text>
  <text start="371.6" dur="4.59">organic coconut oil with sea 60 full</text>
  <text start="374.45" dur="4.11">rings of the highest quality and purity</text>
  <text start="376.19" dur="4.56">and also of course olive oil which has</text>
  <text start="378.56" dur="4.74">been vetted to my statement because this</text>
  <text start="380.75" dur="5.31">is what what I eat in fact another way</text>
  <text start="383.3" dur="6.24">that you could take c60 if you want to</text>
  <text start="386.06" dur="4.29">is to actually pop a cork and if you</text>
  <text start="389.54" dur="3.06">make it yourself</text>
  <text start="390.35" dur="6.87">I&amp;#39;ve got like a wine bottle with like a</text>
  <text start="392.6" dur="6">c60 label you can see you know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="397.22" dur="3.02">good bit in there left I&amp;#39;ve almost</text>
  <text start="398.6" dur="3.23">finished this bottle</text>
  <text start="400.24" dur="3.48">and I&amp;#39;ll say go ahead and say goodbye</text>
  <text start="401.83" dur="3.809">because I&amp;#39;m gonna hold it for a while</text>
  <text start="403.72" dur="4.949">and do like the whole under the tongue</text>
  <text start="405.639" dur="4.471">thing and all of that first but um you</text>
  <text start="408.669" dur="2.941">can just drink it like this if you</text>
  <text start="410.11" dur="4.08">prefer you know I don&amp;#39;t recommend doing</text>
  <text start="411.61" dur="5.429">this if you&amp;#39;re in a bad state of health</text>
  <text start="414.19" dur="4.44">or in a unhealthy kind of diet or</text>
  <text start="417.039" dur="4.111">anything because too much at once if any</text>
  <text start="418.63" dur="3.99">good thing could cause a healing crisis</text>
  <text start="421.15" dur="3.239">or a herxheimer reaction so that&amp;#39;s</text>
