  <text start="89.39" dur="7.14">fought at my great peril we keep those</text>

  <text start="96.53" dur="5.55">very expensive lawyer the lawyer</text>

  <text start="107.63" dur="5.34">same time he has to do the bidding of</text>
  <text start="109.819" dur="4.711">the out of the federal court so he made</text>
  <text start="112.97" dur="3.21">the constant well we&amp;#39;re just about there</text>

  <text start="118.909" dur="4.111">you on this you&amp;#39;re gonna go into these</text>
  <text start="120.14" dur="4.229">stuff these deep briefs that we got to</text>
  <text start="123.02" dur="3.629">get those recordings back into the</text>
  <text start="124.369" dur="4.14">Fourth Circuit trro is issue that we got</text>
  <text start="126.649" dur="4.59">to get those in I said listen to me very</text>
  <text start="128.509" dur="6.691">carefully I want you to tell the CIA</text>
  <text start="131.239" dur="9.391">this verbatim and I didn&amp;#39;t put this in a</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="7.74">book and you know why in a second I said</text>
  <text start="140.63" dur="7.05">you tell them</text>
  <text start="142.94" dur="6.66">I said if they if they if they push me</text>
  <text start="147.68" dur="4.44">in the corner on this those tapes will</text>
  <text start="149.6" dur="4.5">go out public immediately and the lawyer</text>
  <text start="152.12" dur="3.27">said if not can&amp;#39;t say that I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="154.1" dur="6">why I said that he will say that</text>
  <text start="155.39" dur="7.56">verbatim or you no longer my attorney so</text>
  <text start="160.1" dur="5.64">very shortly after the VAT the TR oath</text>
  <text start="162.95" dur="4.47">in court for circuit to speak like it</text>
  <text start="165.74" dur="3.12">was never there the trro is a temporary</text>
  <text start="167.42" dur="3.42">restraining order I couldn&amp;#39;t destroy the</text>
  <text start="168.86" dur="3.36">tapes I had to place them in in the</text>
  <text start="170.84" dur="4.46">possession of the Fourth Circuit federal</text>
  <text start="172.22" dur="5.73">court for their of classification but</text>
  <text start="175.3" dur="6.7">because they&amp;#39;d already destroyed me</text>
  <text start="177.95" dur="7.2">I&amp;#39;ve already watching men die I&amp;#39;m living</text>
  <text start="182" dur="5.49">in existence that&amp;#39;s barely recognizable</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="4.11">as human we don&amp;#39;t have any human contact</text>
  <text start="187.49" dur="3.93">at all except for that they come into</text>
  <text start="189.26" dur="3.66">the area where we are we were captain</text>
  <text start="191.42" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re there to beat us into submission</text>
  <text start="192.92" dur="7.62">I watched a man die killed in that</text>
  <text start="196.04" dur="6.96">regard so it&amp;#39;s going to severe maximum</text>
  <text start="200.54" dur="5.37">security a pre-trial this is how you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="203" dur="5.01">treated free trial let me say this</text>
  <text start="205.91" dur="4.2">ninety-eight percent of federal</text>
  <text start="208.01" dur="4.1">convictions are plea bargains and</text>
  <text start="210.11" dur="4.349">they&amp;#39;re convicted you don&amp;#39;t go to trial</text>
  <text start="212.11" dur="4.03">then I want those people going to trial</text>
  <text start="214.459" dur="2.851">but that&amp;#39;s the way that system is</text>
  <text start="216.14" dur="2.94">supposed to work we&amp;#39;re supposed to have</text>
  <text start="217.31" dur="4.29">a de river up here so we can gaol openly</text>
  <text start="219.08" dur="4.26">I had a gambler I couldn&amp;#39;t speak I was</text>
  <text start="221.6" dur="2.63">facing 50 years in prison I couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="223.34" dur="4.2">talk to the judge</text>
  <text start="224.23" dur="4.93">so this is our federal system but dance</text>
  <text start="227.54" dur="4.79">your question I I still have those in my</text>
  <text start="229.16" dur="3.17">possession thank you very much</text>
  <text start="238.29" dur="3.61">my father had worked for a small task</text>
  <text start="240.76" dur="3.9">force for President Kennedy in</text>
  <text start="241.9" dur="5.55">Washington my mother had known Robert</text>
  <text start="244.66" dur="5.73">Kennedy through her job from Howard</text>
  <text start="247.45" dur="4.59">Hughes through the TWA Airlines she ran</text>
  <text start="250.39" dur="3.15">this shuttle between New York and</text>
  <text start="252.04" dur="5.94">Washington I used to talk all the time</text>
  <text start="253.54" dur="6.36">but I you know I grew up in that that</text>
  <text start="257.98" dur="4.44">kind of bubble it was the Washington DC</text>
  <text start="259.9" dur="4.26">at that time but I didn&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="262.42" dur="4.17">particular interest in the Kennedys but</text>
  <text start="264.16" dur="4.08">when I had this amazing history of the</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="4.17">United States fall into my lap and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="268.24" dur="5.97">looking at all this I felt quite honored</text>
  <text start="270.76" dur="5.76">and overwhelmed of how to breach this</text>
  <text start="274.21" dur="3.15">with the American people so I was told</text>
  <text start="276.52" dur="2.19">by my mother</text>
  <text start="277.36" dur="3.06">you can be extremely careful because</text>
  <text start="278.71" dur="2.79">this could even be considered blackmail</text>
  <text start="280.42" dur="1.95">or it could be a national security</text>
  <text start="281.5" dur="2.79">concern</text>
  <text start="282.37" dur="4.35">you&amp;#39;ve got to tread lightly and figure</text>
  <text start="284.29" dur="3.9">this out as you go and of course that</text>
  <text start="286.72" dur="3.45">was an understatement of the century</text>
  <text start="288.19" dur="3.78">so to answer your question I didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="290.17" dur="3.9">any specific predisposition for that but</text>
  <text start="291.97" dur="5.43">I certainly gained an enormous and</text>
  <text start="294.07" dur="6.69">that&amp;#39;s an understated two word matter of</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="6.18">respect for a man that knew that he was</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="5.55">laying his life on the line for the</text>
  <text start="303.58" dur="6.69">betterment of us and the world credible</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="5.75">amazing human being anybody else</text>

  <text start="317.65" dur="5.19">wanted to indict him he stays mostly in</text>
  <text start="321.13" dur="6.45">British Columbia and travels quite a lot</text>
  <text start="322.84" dur="8.85">to Vietnam but I feel a great</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="5.85">responsibility for the pressures that</text>
  <text start="331.69" dur="3.72">have been put to bear by so many my</text>
  <text start="333.43" dur="5.94">family members I have not seen my sister</text>
  <text start="335.41" dur="7.38">or her children grow up at all so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.37" dur="5.49">uh it&amp;#39;s a lonely existence for me but</text>
  <text start="342.79" dur="5.1">recently just recently at the book my</text>
  <text start="344.86" dur="7.71">father called me and said I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="347.89" dur="8.04">expect this and he said I brought you</text>
  <text start="352.57" dur="5.51">your mom&amp;#39;s brought him so that made me</text>

  <text start="372.25" dur="5.25">with Julius ah I&amp;#39;ve become associated</text>
  <text start="374.29" dur="5.76">with someone who is working with the</text>
  <text start="377.5" dur="5.16">Department of Justice to provide them</text>
  <text start="380.05" dur="4.08">documentation that they could use but</text>
  <text start="382.66" dur="4.83">the person who wrote the foreword for my</text>
  <text start="384.13" dur="4.62">book is friends with RFK jr. write books</text>
  <text start="387.49" dur="1.83">together and they know each other pretty</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="3.27">well</text>
  <text start="389.32" dur="4.41">so we addressed this with RFK jr.</text>
  <text start="392.02" dur="3.24">initially and said the book of this</text>
  <text start="393.73" dur="4.38">book&amp;#39;s coming out do you want to address</text>
  <text start="395.26" dur="4.14">this and RFK jr. said no I want to wait</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="4.59">to see how the American people react</text>
  <text start="399.4" dur="5.28">before I go to speak about it within 60</text>
  <text start="402.7" dur="5.15">days of the book coming out on his</text>
  <text start="404.68" dur="5.28">Facebook it made a statement</text>
  <text start="407.85" dur="3.91">so we said now there is overwhelming</text>
  <text start="409.96" dur="3.93">evidence that the intelligence</text>
  <text start="411.76" dur="3.89">community&amp;#39;s Police Department&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="413.89" dur="4.32">others involved in the US government</text>
  <text start="415.65" dur="6.37">murdered members of my family and</text>
  <text start="418.21" dur="6.78">covered it up and that statement did get</text>
  <text start="422.02" dur="5.37">mentioned in the press a petition Oliver</text>
  <text start="424.99" dur="6.54">Stone signed something big directors</text>
  <text start="427.39" dur="5.97">signed it RFK jr. signed it his family</text>
  <text start="431.53" dur="4.5">which wanted to open up this</text>
  <text start="433.36" dur="5.96">investigation of not only the Kennedys</text>
  <text start="436.03" dur="6.21">but Martin Luther King and Malcolm X I</text>
  <text start="439.32" dur="5.35">didn&amp;#39;t sign it the reason I didn&amp;#39;t sign</text>
  <text start="442.24" dur="5.1">it is because I&amp;#39;ve been in the belly of</text>
  <text start="444.67" dur="4.02">this with the Justice Department and the</text>
  <text start="447.34" dur="4.17">Justice Department and the White House</text>
  <text start="448.69" dur="5.19">Bill Clinton their orders are simple</text>
  <text start="451.51" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s gonna be no opening this case</text>
  <text start="453.88" dur="4.67">there&amp;#39;s no prosecution to pull me from</text>
  <text start="456.07" dur="5.1">this case they&amp;#39;re not opening this case</text>
  <text start="458.55" dur="4.39">the only poll that they had that I</text>
  <text start="461.17" dur="3.78">understood was if a Kennedy family</text>
  <text start="462.94" dur="4.53">member or to go to Texas with new</text>
  <text start="464.95" dur="6.96">evidence that&amp;#39;s the position that JFK</text>
  <text start="467.47" dur="6.42">jr. found himself in I didn&amp;#39;t sign up</text>
  <text start="471.91" dur="4.5">because they&amp;#39;re not going to open this</text>
  <text start="473.89" dur="5.52">Pandora&amp;#39;s Box it back doors to many</text>
  <text start="476.41" dur="6.3">things you know if they promised a cute</text>
  <text start="479.41" dur="5.82">one high-powered member of government or</text>
  <text start="482.71" dur="5.07">does that and then the federal system</text>
  <text start="485.23" dur="4.17">the way it works is you you rat on this</text>
  <text start="487.78" dur="3.58">person the next person tells on this</text>
  <text start="489.4" dur="3.489">person and that&amp;#39;s how it goes</text>
  <text start="491.36" dur="5.13">first person in the door gets the best</text>
  <text start="492.889" dur="6.12">deal they&amp;#39;re making deals right so you</text>
  <text start="496.49" dur="3.959">indict a very high-profile person he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="499.009" dur="2.75">connected to all these other people will</text>
  <text start="500.449" dur="3.69">there were is esta</text>
  <text start="501.759" dur="3.671">so you set off a chain reaction and that</text>
  <text start="504.139" dur="4.53">chain reaction could bring down a</text>
  <text start="505.43" dur="6.06">government so even Donald Trump is not</text>
  <text start="508.669" dur="4.05">going to do that arbitrarily always have</text>
  <text start="511.49" dur="2.76">to do it very carefully because if</text>
  <text start="512.719" dur="5.55">you&amp;#39;re gonna do that he&amp;#39;s the president</text>
  <text start="514.25" dur="6.149">of one it won&amp;#39;t be a US government my</text>
  <text start="518.269" dur="3.721">grandfather had the same you can&amp;#39;t play</text>
  <text start="520.399" dur="4.411">an honest game apart with everyone else</text>
  <text start="521.99" dur="4.849">achieve and that is certainly where we</text>
  <text start="524.81" dur="9.06">find ourselves in Washington DC today</text>
