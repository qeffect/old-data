  <text start="146.36" dur="4.02">things that have been in the news for</text>
  <text start="148.28" dur="4.47">example the CIA just Declassified a</text>
  <text start="150.38" dur="4.59">document that justified the Iraq</text>
  <text start="152.75" dur="4.379">invasion except that the Bush</text>
  <text start="154.97" dur="2.48">administration basically lied I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="157.129" dur="2.121">to go</text>
  <text start="157.45" dur="3.78">synopsize for I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="159.25" dur="4.26">word synopsize but give me the short</text>
  <text start="161.23" dur="3.81">synopsis Congress eventually concluded</text>
  <text start="163.51" dur="4.229">that the Bush administration had</text>
  <text start="165.04" dur="4.35">overstated its dire warnings about the</text>
  <text start="167.739" dur="3.541">Iraqi threat and that the</text>
  <text start="169.39" dur="3.81">administration&amp;#39;s claims about Iraq&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.28" dur="4.98">weapons of mass destructions program</text>
  <text start="173.2" dur="5.13">were not I&amp;#39;m sorry were quote not</text>
  <text start="176.26" dur="3.27">supported by the underlying intelligence</text>
  <text start="178.33" dur="2.94">reporting end quote</text>
  <text start="179.53" dur="3.33">but that underlying intelligence</text>
  <text start="181.27" dur="4.439">reporting contained in the so-called</text>
  <text start="182.86" dur="4.98">National Intelligence Estimate nie that</text>
  <text start="185.709" dur="5.03">was used to justify the invasion has</text>
  <text start="187.84" dur="5.94">remained shrouded in mystery until now</text>
  <text start="190.739" dur="5.56">the CIA released a copy of the nie in</text>
  <text start="193.78" dur="4.23">2004 in response to a FOIA request but</text>
  <text start="196.299" dur="4.291">redacted virtually all of it</text>
  <text start="198.01" dur="4.68">citing threat to national security then</text>
  <text start="200.59" dur="4.14">last year John Greenwald who operates</text>
  <text start="202.69" dur="4.68">the black vault a clearinghouse for</text>
  <text start="204.73" dur="4.979">declassified government documents asked</text>
  <text start="207.37" dur="4.89">the CIA to take another look at the</text>
  <text start="209.709" dur="4.321">October 2002 nie to determine whether</text>
  <text start="212.26" dur="2.96">any additional portions of it could be</text>
  <text start="214.03" dur="3.959">declassified</text>
  <text start="215.22" dur="4.599">the agency responded to Greenwald this</text>
  <text start="217.989" dur="3.75">past January and provided him with a new</text>
  <text start="219.819" dur="4.621">version of the nie which he shared</text>
  <text start="221.739" dur="4.59">exclusively with vice news that restores</text>
  <text start="224.44" dur="3.96">the majority of the pre-war Iraq</text>
  <text start="226.329" dur="4.171">intelligence that has eluded historians</text>
  <text start="228.4" dur="4.89">journalists and war critics for more</text>
  <text start="230.5" dur="6.06">than a decade Wow</text>
  <text start="233.29" dur="4.89">so basically guys and it&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="236.56" dur="4.1">another little short clip before I go on</text>
  <text start="238.18" dur="5.79">here another word the fact that the IE</text>
  <text start="240.66" dur="5.169">concluded getting some static I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="243.97" dur="3.21">know what that&amp;#39;s about the fact that the</text>
  <text start="245.829" dur="3.571">nie concluded that there was no</text>
  <text start="247.18" dur="5.13">operational tie between Saddam and</text>
  <text start="249.4" dur="6.42">al-qaeda did not offset this alarming</text>
  <text start="252.31" dur="6.09">assessment so you know basically just on</text>
  <text start="255.82" dur="4.949">and on this is more and more evidence</text>
  <text start="258.4" dur="5.63">that these wars that we fight often or</text>
  <text start="260.769" dur="6.781">based on you know all seven ins you know</text>
  <text start="264.03" dur="5.17">powerful people&amp;#39;s pretext for justifying</text>
  <text start="267.55" dur="3.54">different types of battles where</text>
  <text start="269.2" dur="4.5">innocent people go to kill each other</text>
  <text start="271.09" dur="4.29">for lies that&amp;#39;s pretty much all the wars</text>
  <text start="273.7" dur="4.26">for the most part there are exceptions</text>
  <text start="275.38" dur="4.71">in some cases for example the</text>
  <text start="277.96" dur="4.32">Revolutionary War in America where we</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="6.27">shirked off the chains of dictatorship</text>
  <text start="282.28" dur="4.98">and monarchy now continuing on let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="286.36" dur="3.39">where were we</text>
  <text start="287.26" dur="3.49">we have Grassley sending letter to AG</text>
  <text start="289.75" dur="2.62">bill Barr seeking</text>
  <text start="290.75" dur="3.36">an update on the criminal referral of</text>
  <text start="292.37" dur="5.4">avenatti you guys remember the porn star</text>
  <text start="294.11" dur="7.41">lawyer and sweat Nick to DOJ for</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="6.78">Cavanagh smears so Julie sweat Nick and</text>
  <text start="301.52" dur="4.71">and avenatti and and others we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="304.55" dur="3.18">part of this big smear</text>
  <text start="306.23" dur="3.3">I think Pelosi called it like the</text>
  <text start="307.73" dur="4.29">wrap-up smear or whatever there&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="309.53" dur="4.26">dogs but basically they were very</text>
  <text start="312.02" dur="4.23">dishonest people when they got a lot of</text>
  <text start="313.79" dur="4.5">Fame a lot of money a lot of PR public</text>
  <text start="316.25" dur="4.2">attention free PR from the you know the</text>
  <text start="318.29" dur="4.92">fake news of course and the Democrat</text>
  <text start="320.45" dur="5.61">Party threw out the red carpet for them</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="4.98">for some lies because they were willing</text>
  <text start="326.06" dur="4.05">to take the controversial stance I guess</text>
  <text start="328.19" dur="3.78">of hating President Trump and lying</text>
  <text start="330.11" dur="4.83">about it not exactly that controversial</text>
  <text start="331.97" dur="4.62">on the left anyway so you know it&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="334.94" dur="3.47">to see that Grassley is following up on</text>
  <text start="336.59" dur="4.35">this because we really do want to see</text>
  <text start="338.41" dur="4.96">justice in this case an example set</text>
  <text start="340.94" dur="4.62">because you cannot keep doing things</text>
  <text start="343.37" dur="3.75">like false rape allegations to bring</text>
  <text start="345.56" dur="3.42">down your political opponents it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="4.02">a it&amp;#39;s a terrible tactic and it needs to</text>
  <text start="348.98" dur="3.45">be exposed we need to see what their</text>
  <text start="351.14" dur="4.17">PlayBook really is so that we can</text>
  <text start="352.43" dur="5.01">understand how the game works and we the</text>
  <text start="355.31" dur="4.59">people can be prepared for for making</text>
  <text start="357.44" dur="6.63">better decisions in that very confusing</text>
  <text start="359.9" dur="6.93">and and mafia ask Game of Thrones so</text>
  <text start="364.07" dur="4.32">when individual and this is a quote when</text>
  <text start="366.83" dur="3.36">individuals intentionally mislead the</text>
  <text start="368.39" dur="2.85">committee they divert important</text>
  <text start="370.19" dur="2.85">committee resources during</text>
  <text start="371.24" dur="4.98">time-sensitive investigations and</text>
  <text start="373.04" dur="4.98">materially impede its work such acts are</text>
  <text start="376.22" dur="4.29">not only unfair they are potentially</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="4.41">illegal it is illegal to make materially</text>
  <text start="380.51" dur="2.94">false fictitious or fraudulent</text>
  <text start="382.43" dur="3.15">statements to congressional</text>
  <text start="383.45" dur="4.95">investigators it is illegal to obstruct</text>
  <text start="385.58" dur="4.5">committee investigations quote the next</text>
  <text start="388.4" dur="3.27">Supreme Court nominee should not have to</text>
  <text start="390.08" dur="4.2">defend himself or herself against</text>
  <text start="391.67" dur="5.1">baseless and fabricated allegations and</text>
  <text start="394.28" dur="4.32">committee staff should not have to spend</text>
  <text start="396.77" dur="5.28">valuable time investigating them</text>
  <text start="398.6" dur="6.54">Grassley added very interesting and and</text>
  <text start="402.05" dur="4.89">very true so I&amp;#39;m really happy to see</text>
  <text start="405.14" dur="3.81">that and maybe like with Jesse Smollett</text>
  <text start="406.94" dur="4.62">it seems to be trending toward real</text>
  <text start="408.95" dur="4.8">justice and in all cases I mean all</text>
  <text start="411.56" dur="4.56">these major points at least might take a</text>
  <text start="413.75" dur="4.02">while but eventually you know Jesse&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="416.12" dur="2.73">not looking too strong anymore they look</text>
  <text start="417.77" dur="3.3">like for a while he was gonna get away</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="4.47">with it but you know investigations are</text>
  <text start="421.07" dur="3.84">now opened into that as well and</text>
  <text start="423.32" dur="4.53">the district attorney that let him off</text>
  <text start="424.91" dur="5.49">so here we go</text>
  <text start="427.85" dur="5.3">continuing we have John Durham expanding</text>
  <text start="430.4" dur="6.54">his investigation timeline to include</text>
  <text start="433.15" dur="5.23">2016 election spying so this is very</text>
  <text start="436.94" dur="3.69">interesting and it looks like it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="438.38" dur="4.02">basically go all the way up Durham is</text>
  <text start="440.63" dur="3.96">now looking at evidence up to the launch</text>
  <text start="442.4" dur="5.49">of the Mueller special Council so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.59" dur="6.93">already now up to the 2016 special</text>
  <text start="447.89" dur="6.65">council witch hunt you know this this</text>
  <text start="451.52" dur="6.21">Mueller witch hunt and that&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="454.54" dur="5.35">really really interesting to see and</text>
  <text start="457.73" dur="4.62">especially if it worked to actually trip</text>
  <text start="459.89" dur="4.17">into the witch on itself because</text>
  <text start="462.35" dur="3.96">obviously there&amp;#39;s overlap we already</text>
  <text start="464.06" dur="4.11">have meal relying on on committing</text>
  <text start="466.31" dur="3.42">perjury lie under oath so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.17" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s all this overlap in these cases</text>
  <text start="469.73" dur="5.73">are so intertwined and it&amp;#39;s when it when</text>
  <text start="473.66" dur="3.93">it comes all out it&amp;#39;s gonna be big it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.46" dur="3.45">gonna require flow charts and graphs for</text>
  <text start="477.59" dur="4.08">people to understand it all but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.91" dur="4.05">gonna be big and these guys are probably</text>
  <text start="481.67" dur="3.42">gonna go down for treason there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="482.96" dur="5.76">other way out you can&amp;#39;t give them a slap</text>
  <text start="485.09" dur="5.34">on the wrist people will will mentally</text>
  <text start="488.72" dur="3.81">reject the government&amp;#39;s authority at</text>
  <text start="490.43" dur="4.35">that point millions of people will say</text>
  <text start="492.53" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s no such thing as true justice in</text>
  <text start="494.78" dur="4.2">this country it&amp;#39;s a mockery of justice</text>
  <text start="497.27" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s a two-tiered system they are the</text>
  <text start="498.98" dur="4.32">the slave masters and we are the slaves</text>
  <text start="500.72" dur="5.7">and I won&amp;#39;t be part of it you know</text>
  <text start="503.3" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ll think so you know to</text>
  <text start="506.42" dur="4.8">a sense government has all the power but</text>
  <text start="508.31" dur="4.44">in another sense just like the the funny</text>
  <text start="511.22" dur="3.24">money that they give us it only has</text>
  <text start="512.75" dur="5.15">power because we believe it has power</text>
  <text start="514.46" dur="6.87">and when people with withhold their</text>
  <text start="517.9" dur="5.68">consent to these different types of</text>
  <text start="521.33" dur="3.84">governments and such the people can</text>
  <text start="523.58" dur="3.15">retake their power you know so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="525.17" dur="2.88">saying do anything illegal not saying</text>
  <text start="526.73" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t pay your taxes or anything like</text>
  <text start="528.05" dur="4.17">that I&amp;#39;m just saying that people will</text>
  <text start="530.93" dur="4.31">start to see that the emperor has no</text>
  <text start="532.22" dur="5.28">clothes that that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="535.24" dur="4.45">legitimate and they will start to turn</text>
  <text start="537.5" dur="4.05">against it if that&amp;#39;s the case and and</text>
  <text start="539.69" dur="4.14">that will represent itself in millions</text>
  <text start="541.55" dur="3.72">of ways you know from probably from tax</text>
  <text start="543.83" dur="3.21">evasion all the way up to people not</text>
  <text start="545.27" dur="3.66">wanting to join the government not</text>
  <text start="547.04" dur="3.51">wanting to join the military not wanting</text>
  <text start="548.93" dur="5.13">to support it wanting to starve it of</text>
  <text start="550.55" dur="4.63">all its resources you know it in a sense</text>
  <text start="554.06" dur="3.79">the government is</text>
  <text start="555.18" dur="5.25">the greatest enemy of the people so we</text>
  <text start="557.85" dur="4.23">need to see justice to restore people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.43" dur="4.29">confidence we need to see that to</text>
  <text start="562.08" dur="5.009">restore people&amp;#39;s faith and other than</text>
  <text start="564.72" dur="5.309">that I think it&amp;#39;s out I think we have</text>
  <text start="567.089" dur="5.731">reached about as far as you can go</text>
  <text start="570.029" dur="4.921">before a society really goes into its</text>
  <text start="572.82" dur="4.65">late stage decadence and we&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="574.95" dur="4.079">kind of passed the usual rate of</text>
  <text start="577.47" dur="4.26">collapse for societies usually I think</text>
  <text start="579.029" dur="4.591">it&amp;#39;s about 200 years so most empires</text>

  <text start="672.779" dur="3.781">you&amp;#39;re still watching these videos you</text>
  <text start="674.7" dur="3.72">probably have to go through all sorts of</text>
  <text start="676.56" dur="3.96">loopholes and headaches to find the</text>
  <text start="678.42" dur="4.68">videos maybe you have to go bookmark my</text>
  <text start="680.52" dur="3.689">page or you know maybe you are on the</text>

  <text start="684.209" dur="2.581">videos that way</text>
  <text start="684.9" dur="5.129">because we send out the the emails to</text>

  <text start="690.029" dur="3.151">it&amp;#39;s difficult to find me I mean very</text>
  <text start="691.68" dur="3.96">few people tell me that they find me</text>
  <text start="693.18" dur="3.72">through natural just showing up on the</text>
  <text start="695.64" dur="2.55">list for example and that used to be</text>
  <text start="696.9" dur="4.47">very different I used to be on the top</text>
  <text start="698.19" dur="5.07">of that list often so for the most part</text>
  <text start="701.37" dur="2.75">even subscription some people still tell</text>
  <text start="703.26" dur="3.51">me they get the subscription</text>
  <text start="704.12" dur="4.15">notifications and that&amp;#39;s fine but many</text>
  <text start="706.77" dur="3.84">people tell me that they don&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="708.27" dur="3.509">they&amp;#39;re getting removed still you know</text>
  <text start="710.61" dur="2.55">that&amp;#39;s an old trick that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="713.16" dur="4.59">still doing that still obvious about it</text>
  <text start="715.46" dur="4.99">and you know there&amp;#39;s videos out there of</text>
  <text start="717.75" dur="4.35">that one as well so a little bit more</text>
  <text start="720.45" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;ve kind of covered this one already</text>

  <text start="816.69" dur="4.31">experiences</text>
  <text start="818.21" dur="4.62">when I was an expectant father a couple</text>
  <text start="821" dur="3.12">months away from the birth of my first</text>
  <text start="822.83" dur="2.64">daughter which she just heard a little</text>
  <text start="824.12" dur="4.98">bit ago running around playing with the</text>
  <text start="825.47" dur="6.78">dogs you know I was banned outright and</text>
  <text start="829.1" dur="6.54">I had just recently gone from my normal</text>
  <text start="832.25" dur="5.97">day job to full-time youtuber journalist</text>
  <text start="835.64" dur="3.93">and and I was like so excited I had</text>
  <text start="838.22" dur="3.18">found a way to make a career out of</text>
  <text start="839.57" dur="4.08">telling the truth and to help break the</text>
  <text start="841.4" dur="4.41">fake news media and then suddenly just</text>
  <text start="843.65" dur="4.38">band you know and that&amp;#39;s my income</text>
  <text start="845.81" dur="3.78">source that was everything I had coming</text>
  <text start="848.03" dur="3.36">in that was next month&amp;#39;s rent and</text>
  <text start="849.59" dur="3.51">everything else so I had to build a</text>
  <text start="851.39" dur="4.62">whole new channel up from that point and</text>
  <text start="853.1" dur="5.91">and really you know really dive in and</text>
  <text start="856.01" dur="4.68">and really commit the 18-hour days for</text>
  <text start="859.01" dur="3.89">the last two years since cue started</text>
  <text start="860.69" dur="5.58">basically I&amp;#39;ve been going nonstop and</text>
  <text start="862.9" dur="5.71">you know that&amp;#39;s late nights endless</text>
  <text start="866.27" dur="5.88">caffeine exhaustion just just non-stop</text>
  <text start="868.61" dur="4.86">and instead of getting rewarded for for</text>
  <text start="872.15" dur="4.5">trying to bring value to people they</text>
  <text start="873.47" dur="4.74">punish you they censor your your channel</text>
  <text start="876.65" dur="3.27">they D monetize you so you can&amp;#39;t earn a</text>
  <text start="878.21" dur="2.88">living doing it and they&amp;#39;ve done all</text>
  <text start="879.92" dur="3.09">these different things so that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="881.09" dur="3.48">kind of you know on the back end you</text>
  <text start="883.01" dur="3.48">know my wife was stressed and worried</text>
  <text start="884.57" dur="3.96">while pregnant about you know the</text>
  <text start="886.49" dur="3.81">pregnancy in them and and that could</text>
  <text start="888.53" dur="4.26">have ended much worse than me she nearly</text>
  <text start="890.3" dur="4.5">died in childbirth so you know in theory</text>
  <text start="892.79" dur="3.75">the stress from this could be it could</text>
  <text start="894.8" dur="3.6">have killed my wife in childbirth and</text>
  <text start="896.54" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s the kind of stuff that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="898.4" dur="5.55">doing to people heartlessly don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="900.86" dur="6.63">at all right I mean she lost half of her</text>
  <text start="903.95" dur="5.13">blood what if you know and we know that</text>
  <text start="907.49" dur="4.56">stress affects health so what if it had</text>
  <text start="909.08" dur="4.68">been just a little bit worse you know</text>
  <text start="912.05" dur="3.09">and I&amp;#39;m not saying it was linked</text>
  <text start="913.76" dur="3.09">directly to that I&amp;#39;m just saying that</text>
  <text start="915.14" dur="3.96">these things all contribute and can add</text>
  <text start="916.85" dur="4.44">to the load that an expectant mother is</text>
  <text start="919.1" dur="3.66">gonna go through if she doesn&amp;#39;t know if</text>
