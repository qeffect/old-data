  <text start="199.01" dur="4.74">president&amp;#39;s call with several people</text>
  <text start="201.379" dur="6.451">which is likely a violation of the</text>
  <text start="203.75" dur="6.87">leaking statute u.s. code 798 so this is</text>
  <text start="207.83" dur="4.89">shifts witness and leaker Colonel</text>
  <text start="210.62" dur="4.92">Alexander Vanneman and it gets better</text>
  <text start="212.72" dur="5.28">already in this short time because I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="215.54" dur="4.559">day behind here I was actually paralyzed</text>
  <text start="218" dur="4.2">yesterday I couldn&amp;#39;t even move all day</text>

  <text start="232.76" dur="6.059">accounting witness anyway more like</text>
  <text start="234.7" dur="5.95">conspiratorial it&amp;#39;s tough I think so</text>
  <text start="238.819" dur="4.2">witness VIN Men&amp;#39;s Health Committee he</text>
  <text start="240.65" dur="4.68">shared classified readouts of Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.019" dur="5.55">coal and when Jim Jordan asked who</text>
  <text start="245.33" dur="7.2">Schiff shut him down and didn&amp;#39;t allow a</text>
  <text start="248.569" dur="6.541">question so interesting huh who got</text>
  <text start="252.53" dur="5.459">these classified readouts of trumps call</text>
  <text start="255.11" dur="4.439">from this leaker illegally when there</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="3.78">was nothing in there worth leaking so</text>
  <text start="259.549" dur="5.401">therefore the whistleblower stuff</text>
  <text start="261.769" dur="6.601">doesn&amp;#39;t even come into play here so also</text>
  <text start="264.95" dur="5.19">we have a top Democrat witness and papas</text>
  <text start="268.37" dur="4.169">nutjob I like how they&amp;#39;re describing him</text>
  <text start="270.14" dur="5.01">as not now but not whistleblower do you</text>
  <text start="272.539" dur="4.56">notice failed to tamper he tried and</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="4.31">failed to tamper with the rough draft of</text>
  <text start="277.099" dur="6.691">president&amp;#39;s call to Ukrainian president</text>
  <text start="279.46" dur="7.39">so this guy actually tried to change</text>
  <text start="283.79" dur="4.68">things he tried to tamper with I was</text>
  <text start="286.85" dur="3.21">getting very interesting</text>
  <text start="288.47" dur="4.23">can&amp;#39;t believe they actually got caught</text>
  <text start="290.06" dur="4.71">at this one so during questioning on</text>
  <text start="292.7" dur="3.66">Tuesday Colonel bin Minh and he never</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="3.69">wears his uniform normally by the way</text>
  <text start="296.36" dur="3.6">shared the readout admitted that he</text>
  <text start="298.46" dur="3.03">showed the readouts of President Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.96" dur="4.2">call with the Ukrainian president</text>
  <text start="301.49" dur="5.82">Solinsky with several other secret</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="4.92">operatives when representative Jim</text>
  <text start="307.31" dur="4.5">Jordan asked him who he shared the</text>
  <text start="309.08" dur="5.46">readouts with Adam Schiff shut down the</text>
  <text start="311.81" dur="4.8">questioning mm-hmm because Adam Schiff</text>
  <text start="314.54" dur="3.9">is probably one of them and he knows it</text>
  <text start="316.61" dur="2.87">as well but we&amp;#39;ll get to that in a</text>
  <text start="318.44" dur="4.23">minute</text>
  <text start="319.48" dur="5.26">so we also have Fox News reporting that</text>
  <text start="322.67" dur="5.64">Colonel then than likely violated like I</text>
  <text start="324.74" dur="6.84">said 18 USC 798 when he leaked this call</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="5.43">and he also now admitted during</text>
  <text start="331.58" dur="5.04">testimony that he tampered with and</text>
  <text start="333.74" dur="5.79">tried but failed to alter the transcript</text>
  <text start="336.62" dur="5.58">of the president&amp;#39;s call to the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="339.53" dur="5.55">president Wow</text>
  <text start="342.2" dur="5.79">so here we go New York Times reported</text>
  <text start="345.08" dur="5.13">quote with lieutenant colonel Alexander</text>
  <text start="347.99" dur="4.53">s Feynman the top ukraine expert on the</text>
  <text start="350.21" dur="4.709">national security council told house</text>
  <text start="352.52" dur="3.99">impeachment investigators on tuesday</text>
  <text start="354.919" dur="3.75">that the White House transcript of a</text>
  <text start="356.51" dur="4.68">July call between President Trump and</text>
  <text start="358.669" dur="5.431">Ukraine&amp;#39;s president omitted two crucial</text>
  <text start="361.19" dur="4.92">words and phrases and that his attempts</text>
  <text start="364.1" dur="4.94">to include them failed according to</text>
  <text start="366.11" dur="5.76">three people familiar with the testimony</text>
  <text start="369.04" dur="4.54">the emissions Colonel Vanneman said</text>
  <text start="371.87" dur="4.38">included mr. Trump&amp;#39;s assertion that</text>
  <text start="373.58" dur="5.67">there were recordings of former vice</text>
  <text start="376.25" dur="5.46">president Joseph R Biden Jr discussing</text>
  <text start="379.25" dur="5.94">Ukraine corruption and an explicit</text>

  <text start="391.19" dur="3.75">son hunter</text>
  <text start="392.6" dur="4.83">Colonel then men who appeared on Capitol</text>
  <text start="394.94" dur="6.03">Hill wearing his dark blue army dress</text>
  <text start="397.43" dur="5.489">uniform and military medals right told</text>
  <text start="400.97" dur="4.59">House impeachment investigators that he</text>
  <text start="402.919" dur="4.561">tried to change the reconstructed</text>
  <text start="405.56" dur="4.59">transcript made by the White House staff</text>
  <text start="407.48" dur="3.9">to reflect the emissions but while some</text>
  <text start="410.15" dur="4.35">of his edits appeared to have been</text>
  <text start="411.38" dur="6.06">successful he said those two corrections</text>
  <text start="414.5" dur="4.979">were not made the phrases do not</text>
  <text start="417.44" dur="4.08">fundamentally change lawmakers</text>
  <text start="419.479" dur="2.821">understanding of the call which was</text>
  <text start="421.52" dur="4.26">first reported</text>
  <text start="422.3" dur="7.38">by the CIA whistleblower whose complaint</text>
  <text start="425.78" dur="6.09">set off the impeachment inquiry Wow and</text>
  <text start="429.68" dur="4.5">of course I&amp;#39;m using this the same air</text>
  <text start="431.87" dur="5.519">fingers for air quotes for whistleblower</text>
  <text start="434.18" dur="5.01">there so it&amp;#39;s getting very interesting</text>
  <text start="437.389" dur="3.361">of course this guy seems to have come</text>
  <text start="439.19" dur="3.449">out of nowhere and really has it out for</text>
  <text start="440.75" dur="4.46">President Trump even to the point he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.639" dur="6.21">trying to edit in transcripts and such</text>
  <text start="445.21" dur="6.91">very interesting now we have the</text>
  <text start="448.849" dur="7.741">response now we even have Republican</text>
  <text start="452.12" dur="6.329">gates we will call in Adam Schiff as a</text>
  <text start="456.59" dur="5.549">fact witness to the House Judiciary</text>
  <text start="458.449" dur="5.731">impeachment hurry guys this is a pretty</text>
  <text start="462.139" dur="4.53">big thing because as we know Adam Schiff</text>
  <text start="464.18" dur="5.639">having involved himself already to the</text>
  <text start="466.669" dur="6.72">extent that he has is himself a witness</text>
  <text start="469.819" dur="6.421">in this case so he&amp;#39;s now a player and a</text>
  <text start="473.389" dur="5.52">judge somehow that&amp;#39;s not going last but</text>
  <text start="476.24" dur="4.41">the fact is he&amp;#39;s actually on the bench</text>
  <text start="478.909" dur="2.341">now he&amp;#39;s gonna be called in for</text>
  <text start="480.65" dur="3.479">questioning</text>
  <text start="481.25" dur="4.409">in this totally legit so it&amp;#39;s gonna get</text>
  <text start="484.129" dur="6.6">very interesting I bet he&amp;#39;s gonna say I</text>
  <text start="485.659" dur="7.521">can&amp;#39;t recall 100 times anyway so this is</text>
  <text start="490.729" dur="5.671">going to be the next step and of course</text>
  <text start="493.18" dur="6.78">we have it pretty much from everyone</text>
  <text start="496.4" dur="8.28">that no one&amp;#39;s taking it seriously even</text>
  <text start="499.96" dur="9.31">even though many on Republican team are</text>
  <text start="504.68" dur="6.66">sort of like Fox News for example trying</text>
  <text start="509.27" dur="3.809">to sort of play into the the narrative</text>
  <text start="511.34" dur="4.8">that it&amp;#39;s actually possible with there</text>
  <text start="513.079" dur="4.681">they&amp;#39;re rigged polls saying that oh yeah</text>
  <text start="516.14" dur="3.75">we could we could sort of totally see an</text>
  <text start="517.76" dur="3.449">impeachment and Republicans even support</text>
  <text start="519.89" dur="2.939">it to some degree but they were</text>
  <text start="521.209" dur="5.521">oversampling you know they got like</text>
  <text start="522.829" dur="4.921">50-something supports impeachment which</text>
  <text start="526.73" dur="4.83">is ridiculous</text>
  <text start="527.75" dur="6.75">and that&amp;#39;s a good 25 30 % too high they</text>
  <text start="531.56" dur="4.44">were oversampling dramatically so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.5" dur="4.68">what they do they are fake</text>
  <text start="536" dur="5.579">magda now of course most of them are</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="4.94">saying this is a sham we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="541.579" dur="5.281">legitimize it this is not you know</text>
  <text start="544.12" dur="4.51">constitutional things like that but</text>
  <text start="546.86" dur="3.979">there are people like gates and Jordan</text>
  <text start="548.63" dur="5.01">and others pushing back at the same time</text>
  <text start="550.839" dur="3.771">one questionable figure in all of this</text>
  <text start="553.64" dur="3.789">remains</text>
  <text start="554.61" dur="5.039">see Graham he could call in the former</text>
  <text start="557.429" dur="5.1">US ambassador called bulk Volker I</text>
  <text start="559.649" dur="5.04">always get that one Volker to testify</text>
  <text start="562.529" dur="5.011">and blow up them impeachment narrative</text>
  <text start="564.689" dur="5.37">but he refuses to act why is that why</text>
  <text start="567.54" dur="5.219">did we continue to have all of these</text>
  <text start="570.059" dur="6">strong words and big talk from Lindsey</text>
  <text start="572.759" dur="7.02">Graham but just seems to be empty words</text>
  <text start="576.059" dur="4.411">and he hasn&amp;#39;t acted yet so maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="579.779" dur="4.35">part of the plan</text>
  <text start="580.47" dur="7.859">or maybe he is the next fake maggot to</text>
  <text start="584.129" dur="6.091">expose and Wow we&amp;#39;re getting pretty</text>
  <text start="588.329" dur="3.72">close to the end of the line effects the</text>
  <text start="590.22" dur="4.619">case of course he was friends with</text>
  <text start="592.049" dur="5.46">McCain remember and his own corruption</text>
  <text start="594.839" dur="3.87">is likely pretty high but we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="597.509" dur="3.721">happens all right guys</text>
