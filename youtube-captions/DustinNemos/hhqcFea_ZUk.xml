  <text start="1.34" dur="4.81">welcome back my friends this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="3.75" dur="3.679">Nemo&amp;#39;s and I have an interesting idea</text>
  <text start="6.15" dur="6.359">for you guys today</text>
  <text start="7.429" dur="7.271">what if President Trump just tricked the</text>
  <text start="12.509" dur="3.991">Democrats and the Rhinos into funding</text>
  <text start="14.7" dur="4.86">their own demise their own military</text>
  <text start="16.5" dur="6.42">tribunals if you&amp;#39;ve been following the</text>
  <text start="19.56" dur="5.04">qyn on stuff lately like I have you are</text>
  <text start="22.92" dur="3.83">aware that there is an alternate</text>
  <text start="24.6" dur="5.07">narrative behind the scenes a theory</text>
  <text start="26.75" dur="5.59">backed up by a lot of evidence and a</text>
  <text start="29.67" dur="6.12">leaker that has proven connections to</text>
  <text start="32.34" dur="5.64">POTUS himself that there is a mass</text>
  <text start="35.79" dur="4.679">arrest coming that there is a mass</text>
  <text start="37.98" dur="4.68">roundup of corruption coming we even</text>
  <text start="40.469" dur="6.241">have executive orders dealing with asset</text>
  <text start="42.66" dur="6.51">forfeiture of corrupt and those who are</text>
  <text start="46.71" dur="5.46">involved in human trafficking especially</text>
  <text start="49.17" dur="4.319">that of children a lot is going on</text>
  <text start="52.17" dur="5.67">behind the scenes that you may or may</text>
  <text start="53.489" dur="7.98">not be aware of yet so everyone&amp;#39;s mad</text>
  <text start="57.84" dur="5.699">right now the Trump base has been</text>
  <text start="61.469" dur="4.531">largely screaming off the Trump train</text>
  <text start="63.539" dur="6.031">some like Ann Coulter have even gone so</text>
  <text start="66" dur="7.4">far as to say you&amp;#39;ll be impeached for</text>
  <text start="69.57" dur="7.939">this even Drudge has kind of backed off</text>
  <text start="73.4" dur="6.34">supporting Trump what does that mean</text>
  <text start="77.509" dur="4.841">because no one&amp;#39;s had time to read the</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="4.23">whole thing yet anyway but we do have a</text>
  <text start="82.35" dur="3.48">lot of information coming out about it</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="4.59">so what that means is that people are</text>
  <text start="85.83" dur="6.63">reacting they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re going off in</text>
  <text start="88.56" dur="6.87">motion instead of information and I want</text>
  <text start="92.46" dur="6.93">to try to help inject a little bit of</text>
  <text start="95.43" dur="5.82">information into the mix today so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="3.39">been looking into this issue all day and</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things in this bill</text>
  <text start="102.78" dur="6.75">that may be sort of a Trojan horse</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="6.75">against the Democratic Genda and I can</text>
  <text start="109.53" dur="4.65">imagine that behind the scenes Trump if</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="7.12">we&amp;#39;re right in cue world Trump is</text>
  <text start="114.18" dur="7.369">probably laughing his ass off right now</text>
  <text start="118.84" dur="5.05">so let&amp;#39;s go through and look at just</text>
  <text start="121.549" dur="5.191">some of the stuff that&amp;#39;s come out now</text>
  <text start="123.89" dur="4.019">first in the queue and on world little</text>
  <text start="126.74" dur="3.6">backstory here if you&amp;#39;re not already</text>
  <text start="127.909" dur="4.201">familiar in queueing on alternate</text>
  <text start="130.34" dur="3.869">narrative that&amp;#39;s going on where we we</text>
  <text start="132.11" dur="4.05">kind of see what&amp;#39;s happening in the the</text>
  <text start="134.209" dur="3.78">hidden civil war behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="136.16" dur="5.31">between Trump and the intelligence</text>
  <text start="137.989" dur="5.521">communities in the deep state SES and</text>
  <text start="141.47" dur="3.93">the mainstream media and pretty much</text>
  <text start="143.51" dur="3.47">every power base in the world it&amp;#39;s come</text>
  <text start="145.4" dur="6.27">out against Trump all the corruption</text>
  <text start="146.98" dur="8.05">coming out against him we have seen a</text>
  <text start="151.67" dur="5.73">theory positive that there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="3.9">a military tribunal mass roundup to</text>
  <text start="157.4" dur="4.44">arrest these corrupt actors and that</text>
  <text start="158.93" dur="5.76">there are a lot of them and that the</text>
  <text start="161.84" dur="6.09">world had to be prepared in advance</text>
  <text start="164.69" dur="5.49">through these leaks through these bread</text>
  <text start="167.93" dur="4.62">crumbs that qa9 has been hinting and</text>
  <text start="170.18" dur="4.23">dropping at while we in the old media</text>
  <text start="172.55" dur="3.57">that follow the cue staff have been</text>
  <text start="174.41" dur="3.63">spreading a lot of really great</text>
  <text start="176.12" dur="5.61">information just really really powerful</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="6.72">stuff that cue Anand has brought to us</text>
  <text start="181.73" dur="4.71">largely through the Socratic method he</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="3.33">asked a lot of questions he leaves a lot</text>
  <text start="186.44" dur="4.74">of hints but we have to go and look up</text>
  <text start="188.09" dur="6.23">the information ourselves and many</text>
  <text start="191.18" dur="6.33">people have been expressing a lot of</text>
  <text start="194.32" dur="5.74">disbelief or skepticism about queuing on</text>
  <text start="197.51" dur="4.83">in which case I can understand that if</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="3.54">you&amp;#39;re not familiar with all of the</text>
  <text start="202.34" dur="3.149">evidence that suggests that he is</text>
  <text start="203.6" dur="3.87">legitimate and is connected to POTUS</text>
  <text start="205.489" dur="4.381">there is a lot and I&amp;#39;m thoroughly</text>
  <text start="207.47" dur="4.97">convinced and I&amp;#39;ve even done videos</text>
  <text start="209.87" dur="5.85">about this that stretched over an hour</text>
  <text start="212.44" dur="4.93">but even if you don&amp;#39;t believe in queuing</text>
  <text start="215.72" dur="3.66">on the information that he brings us</text>
  <text start="217.37" dur="4.56">isto legitimate the information that we</text>
  <text start="219.38" dur="4.65">get whether he works directly with Trump</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="4.619">Trump himself or this guy is just some</text>
  <text start="224.03" dur="4.92">troll in a basement somewhere the</text>
  <text start="226.549" dur="4.021">information is still good he knows a lot</text>
  <text start="228.95" dur="4.68">of stuff including predicting events</text>
  <text start="230.57" dur="4.979">before they happen so let&amp;#39;s go through</text>
  <text start="233.63" dur="5.52">some of the stuff that&amp;#39;s going in this</text>
  <text start="235.549" dur="7.111">bill that has now been signed and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="7.32">talk about it now the negatives the bad</text>
  <text start="242.66" dur="7.15">side this isn&amp;#39;t a massive 1.3 trillion</text>
  <text start="246.47" dur="5.2">dollar omnibus spending agreement</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s not a federal budget which is</text>
  <text start="251.67" dur="4.62">different and has rules with an omnibus</text>
  <text start="254.67" dur="3.659">this is actually on the good side</text>
  <text start="256.29" dur="3.15">president can kind of ignore those rules</text>
  <text start="258.329" dur="4.531">and do what he wants just like Obama</text>
  <text start="259.44" dur="7.41">used to do but the bad things that are</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="5.97">included in the bill would be funding</text>
  <text start="266.85" dur="5.52">for Planned Parenthood pay raises for</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="7.76">the Senate and Congress funding other</text>
  <text start="272.37" dur="7.32">people&amp;#39;s other countries border security</text>
  <text start="276.59" dur="4.99">can&amp;#39;t make that up but also it had a</text>
  <text start="279.69" dur="4.229">rule about not using any of the</text>
  <text start="281.58" dur="3.96">prototypes that Trump had of the wall</text>
  <text start="283.919" dur="3.871">thus far</text>
  <text start="285.54" dur="3.629">you can&amp;#39;t build with those basically it</text>
  <text start="287.79" dur="4.74">doesn&amp;#39;t say you can&amp;#39;t build a wall but</text>
  <text start="289.169" dur="5.25">it does say you can&amp;#39;t build with the</text>
  <text start="292.53" dur="4.1">prototypes you&amp;#39;ve chosen so far and</text>
  <text start="294.419" dur="4.411">there&amp;#39;s a lot of bad stuff in the bill</text>
  <text start="296.63" dur="6.31">definitely they didn&amp;#39;t address the daca</text>
  <text start="298.83" dur="7.17">issue at all and Democrats got a lot of</text>
  <text start="302.94" dur="4.88">pork in this bill but let&amp;#39;s go through</text>
  <text start="306" dur="4.68">some of the things on the positive side</text>
  <text start="307.82" dur="4.87">one it&amp;#39;s an omnibus so Trump can ignore</text>
  <text start="310.68" dur="5.01">it and do what he wants with that money</text>
  <text start="312.69" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s a big deal to he got like eighty</text>
  <text start="315.69" dur="5.64">billion dollars for the military that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.49" dur="6.929">pretty huge huge with a Y like Trump</text>
  <text start="321.33" dur="5.19">says but he also could theoretically</text>
  <text start="324.419" dur="4.681">take that money have the Army Corps of</text>
  <text start="326.52" dur="4.98">Engineers build the wall already paid</text>
  <text start="329.1" dur="3.66">for done no more worrying about it no</text>
  <text start="331.5" dur="4.56">more negotiating the wall would be</text>
  <text start="332.76" dur="5.51">finished paid for this is within his</text>
  <text start="336.06" dur="2.21">power</text>
  <text start="338.51" dur="7.26">page 595 of the bill no funds in this</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="4.53">act shall be used to deny an inspector</text>
  <text start="345.77" dur="4.61">general funded under this act timely</text>
  <text start="347.84" dur="5.39">access to any records documents other</text>
  <text start="350.38" dur="5.71">materials to the department or agency</text>
  <text start="353.23" dur="5.65">over which the IG has responsibilities</text>
  <text start="356.09" dur="6">or to prevent access to records now in</text>
  <text start="358.88" dur="4.86">qa9 world we think that the IG report is</text>
  <text start="362.09" dur="3.93">going to rebuild reveal some very</text>
  <text start="363.74" dur="4.95">damning evidence very soon and that this</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="3.33">will also be used to start some of the</text>
  <text start="368.69" dur="2.79">arrests</text>
  <text start="369.35" dur="4.29">McCabe has already been fired we already</text>
  <text start="371.48" dur="4.77">know that he is being investigated for a</text>
  <text start="373.64" dur="5.94">criminal action alright because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="376.25" dur="5.85">already requested records from the FBI</text>
  <text start="379.58" dur="4.23">and the DOJ and then the response was</text>
  <text start="382.1" dur="3.36">basically that they were going to make</text>
  <text start="383.81" dur="3.78">sure that it didn&amp;#39;t interfere with an</text>
  <text start="385.46" dur="3.69">ongoing investigation things like that</text>
  <text start="387.59" dur="3.48">so we know that there is an ongoing</text>
  <text start="389.15" dur="6.54">investigation but as they use that as an</text>
  <text start="391.07" dur="8.57">excuse to not supply those records</text>
  <text start="395.69" dur="7.91">immediately so this this empowers the IG</text>
  <text start="399.64" dur="8.17">in certain ways this is a big deal</text>
  <text start="403.6" dur="6.49">section 725 omnibus bill prohibits feds</text>
  <text start="407.81" dur="5.06">from monitoring individuals internet use</text>
  <text start="410.09" dur="6.72">this will help protect Internet privacy</text>
  <text start="412.87" dur="5.83">section 613 no funds appropriated by</text>
  <text start="416.81" dur="5.49">this act shall be available to pay for</text>
  <text start="418.7" dur="5.97">an abortion seven eight seven thousand</text>
  <text start="422.3" dur="5.34">18 also forbids funds used for abortions</text>
  <text start="424.67" dur="4.5">so even though there was a lot of money</text>
  <text start="427.64" dur="2.73">funded to Planned Parenthood in this</text>
  <text start="429.17" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re not gonna be allowed to use it</text>
  <text start="430.37" dur="4.38">for an abortion so I still don&amp;#39;t agree</text>
  <text start="432.56" dur="4.23">with it obviously they&amp;#39;ll just they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="434.75" dur="3.75">very profitable company they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="436.79" dur="3.48">use their own profits to pay for the</text>
  <text start="438.5" dur="3.54">abortion they&amp;#39;ll use this somewhere else</text>
  <text start="440.27" dur="5.52">probably but that is still a pretty big</text>
  <text start="442.04" dur="7.23">deal that it was hidden in their section</text>
  <text start="445.79" dur="4.32">718 no appropriations shall be used for</text>
  <text start="449.27" dur="2.4">propaganda</text>
  <text start="450.11" dur="3.78">all right that&amp;#39;s a big deal as well</text>
  <text start="451.67" dur="4.08">because we know that propaganda has been</text>
  <text start="453.89" dur="4.429">legalized in this country for many years</text>
  <text start="455.75" dur="5.509">and they have been liberally using it</text>
  <text start="458.319" dur="4.951">section 632 prevents government from</text>
  <text start="461.259" dur="5.43">grabbing electronic communications data</text>
  <text start="463.27" dur="5.129">this is another privacy one section 8080</text>
  <text start="466.689" dur="4.44">includes protection of our Fourth</text>
  <text start="468.399" dur="4.47">Amendment rights privacy so this</text>
  <text start="471.129" dur="5.76">strengthens the Fourth Amendment a</text>
  <text start="472.869" dur="6.811">little bit section 538 protects medical</text>
  <text start="476.889" dur="5.43">marijuana states strengthen strengthen</text>

  <text start="484.029" dur="7.23">to allow medical marijuana section 210</text>
  <text start="488.889" dur="5.041">none of the funds made available in this</text>

  <text start="493.93" dur="5.669">advocate or promote gun control also</text>
  <text start="497.709" dur="4.2">worth mentioning there was one point</text>
  <text start="499.599" dur="6.72">five million dollars for the OIG</text>
  <text start="501.909" dur="6.391">oversight of the FDA which largely</text>
  <text start="506.319" dur="3.481">basically rubber-stamps these big drug</text>
  <text start="508.3" dur="2.97">companies and Trump has mentioned that</text>
  <text start="509.8" dur="4.44">he&amp;#39;s going to start suing some of these</text>
  <text start="511.27" dur="7.649">opioid companies this is a double whammy</text>
  <text start="514.24" dur="6.179">against them when you have that kind of</text>
  <text start="518.919" dur="3.511">funding obviously you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="520.419" dur="3.511">see some sort of action behind the</text>
  <text start="522.43" dur="3.029">scenes that cost that money that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="523.93" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re using it for so they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="525.459" dur="5.461">start investigating the FDA the US will</text>
  <text start="528.73" dur="5.25">give no funds to any country involved in</text>
  <text start="530.92" dur="5.219">terrorism that&amp;#39;s part of the Omnibus and</text>
  <text start="533.98" dur="4.109">also none of the funds in this act or</text>
  <text start="536.139" dur="4.2">appropriated or otherwise made available</text>
  <text start="538.089" dur="4.291">for a contribution grant or any other</text>
  <text start="540.339" dur="4.56">payment for the Green Climate Fund so</text>
  <text start="542.38" dur="3.93">all of those crazy climate alarmists out</text>
  <text start="544.899" dur="2.94">there who actually still believe that</text>
  <text start="546.31" dur="3.36">the world is getting hotter and that</text>
  <text start="547.839" dur="3.831">we&amp;#39;re all gonna starve and die and burn</text>
  <text start="549.67" dur="4.26">and melt and whatever else they think</text>
  <text start="551.67" dur="6.52">despite all evidence to the contrary</text>
  <text start="553.93" dur="7.889">even despite it coming out that the</text>
  <text start="558.19" dur="4.889">records and the data on the climate on</text>
  <text start="561.819" dur="2.941">the temperature have actually been</text>
  <text start="563.079" dur="4.471">rigged upward about two and a half</text>
  <text start="564.76" dur="5.819">degrees Fahrenheit it&amp;#39;s just one big big</text>
  <text start="567.55" dur="6.269">scam designed to allow for carbon taxes</text>
  <text start="570.579" dur="4.68">and control of the economy when you can</text>
  <text start="573.819" dur="3.21">control which companies are allowed to</text>
  <text start="575.259" dur="4.651">operate based on emissions and you have</text>
  <text start="577.029" dur="5.8">to give permissions to them you have a</text>
  <text start="579.91" dur="7.039">lot of control in the economy</text>
  <text start="582.829" dur="7">so all of that there&amp;#39;s more for the day</text>
  <text start="586.949" dur="3.99">but all of that is from the Omnibus we</text>
  <text start="589.829" dur="3">still don&amp;#39;t know everything that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="590.939" dur="6.15">there obviously that&amp;#39;s a lot of pages</text>
  <text start="592.829" dur="6.72">but these are all great great things so</text>
  <text start="597.089" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;ll see what happens if queuing on is</text>
  <text start="599.549" dur="3.991">right than I expect that the wall is</text>
  <text start="601.859" dur="4.621">about to get built by the Army Corps of</text>
  <text start="603.54" dur="5.279">Engineers I mean he he he basically gave</text>
  <text start="606.48" dur="4.139">us a real short post that had to do with</text>
  <text start="608.819" dur="3.48">green castle and red castle which is</text>
  <text start="610.619" dur="4.71">kind of the way he does things he hints</text>
  <text start="612.299" dur="7.171">at things well what does that mean well</text>
  <text start="615.329" dur="6.331">red castle is the logo of the Army Corps</text>
  <text start="619.47" dur="6.69">of Engineers and their street address is</text>

  <text start="848.399" dur="2.55">trade war with China</text>

  <text start="868.019" dur="4.5">they are a dangerous dragon I liked the</text>
  <text start="870.569" dur="4.281">way that they put that but it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="872.519" dur="4.831">really impressive breakdown of the</text>
  <text start="874.85" dur="5.409">inherent weakness of the Chinese</text>
  <text start="877.35" dur="4.56">centrally planned economy and it is well</text>
  <text start="880.259" dur="3.93">worth a read if you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="881.91" dur="4.56">understand the fundamentals behind the</text>

  <text start="891.18" dur="5.43">are in some big trouble because though</text>
  <text start="893.79" dur="4.26">they seem pretty powerful and they do</text>
  <text start="896.61" dur="3.899">have some strength in their</text>
  <text start="898.05" dur="4.289">manufacturing this article is going to</text>
  <text start="900.509" dur="4.411">walk you through some of the information</text>
  <text start="902.339" dur="4.23">I&amp;#39;m not gonna give it all to you but an</text>
  <text start="904.92" dur="4.2">essentially planned economy there is</text>
  <text start="906.569" dur="9.06">really no price control mechanism and it</text>
  <text start="909.12" dur="9.75">is a very very weak position and it can</text>
  <text start="915.629" dur="5.4">be toppled quite easily so there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="918.87" dur="4.56">of weakness to the Chinese model and</text>
  <text start="921.029" dur="6.5">they basically have been running the</text>
  <text start="923.43" dur="7.199">Communist top-down rule of everything</text>
  <text start="927.529" dur="5.23">and because of this and Chinese history</text>
  <text start="930.629" dur="4.64">is pretty replete with this kind of</text>
  <text start="932.759" dur="5.721">authoritarianism they&amp;#39;re not very</text>
  <text start="935.269" dur="7.63">creative or ingenuitive when it comes to</text>
  <text start="938.48" dur="6.339">or innovative when it comes to solving</text>
  <text start="942.899" dur="4.471">economic issues they basically are only</text>
  <text start="944.819" dur="4.291">gonna do what they are allowed to do</text>
  <text start="947.37" dur="3.12">within the system of current thinking</text>
  <text start="949.11" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re not very good at thinking</text>
  <text start="950.49" dur="4.86">outside of the box and they list you</text>
  <text start="953.37" dur="3.6">know some some examples but you know</text>
  <text start="955.35" dur="4.049">this this would explain why the Chinese</text>
  <text start="956.97" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m not saying they don&amp;#39;t create</text>
  <text start="959.399" dur="4.29">anything and they used to create many</text>
  <text start="960.99" dur="4.469">things like gunpowder and stuff but in</text>
  <text start="963.689" dur="4.2">the modern sense they don&amp;#39;t create too</text>
  <text start="965.459" dur="4.261">many things they more or less steal from</text>
  <text start="967.889" dur="3.57">other people you know there&amp;#39;s that big</text>
  <text start="969.72" dur="5.13">issue with intellectual property theft</text>
  <text start="971.459" dur="5.701">and stealing and also the article goes</text>
  <text start="974.85" dur="5.399">into mentioning how the Chinese economy</text>
  <text start="977.16" dur="4.739">is largely dependent on raw materials</text>
  <text start="980.249" dur="2.851">they don&amp;#39;t produce a lot of their own</text>
  <text start="981.899" dur="4.11">raw materials they don&amp;#39;t even produce</text>
  <text start="983.1" dur="5.039">their own food completely what they do</text>
  <text start="986.009" dur="4.68">is they import raw materials they use</text>
  <text start="988.139" dur="5.161">their they push it through the filter of</text>
  <text start="990.689" dur="5.431">their huge manufacturing capabilities</text>
  <text start="993.3" dur="5.909">and base and then they sell those</text>
  <text start="996.12" dur="4.469">finished goods to the world you cut off</text>
  <text start="999.209" dur="3.151">the raw materials they&amp;#39;re also in</text>
  <text start="1000.589" dur="4.98">trouble so there&amp;#39;s a lot of weak weak</text>
  <text start="1002.36" dur="5.13">places in the Chinese economy and this</text>
  <text start="1005.569" dur="4.051">is why they&amp;#39;re probably ramping up their</text>
  <text start="1007.49" dur="3.899">their military stuff right now because</text>
  <text start="1009.62" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re trying to protect themselves and</text>
  <text start="1011.389" dur="4.8">they are in trouble so in some sense the</text>
  <text start="1014.6" dur="3.599">Chinese economy is actually the one of</text>
  <text start="1016.189" dur="3.581">the weakest in the world or at least the</text>
  <text start="1018.199" dur="4.541">most fragile</text>
