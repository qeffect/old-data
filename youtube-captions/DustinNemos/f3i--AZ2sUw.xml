  <text start="21.36" dur="5.71">all right my friends welcome back this</text>
  <text start="24.43" dur="4.98">is Dustin Nemo&amp;#39;s and I want to talk to</text>
  <text start="27.07" dur="5.97">you guys a little bit about crypto the</text>
  <text start="29.41" dur="6.48">crypto market the crypto mining market a</text>
  <text start="33.04" dur="5.49">new project I&amp;#39;m gonna start doing as a</text>
  <text start="35.89" dur="6.3">little bit of side consulting in the</text>
  <text start="38.53" dur="7.049">crypto space in the market before mining</text>
  <text start="42.19" dur="6.15">itself so when that said I wanted to</text>
  <text start="45.579" dur="5.281">show you guys a little bit of the</text>
  <text start="48.34" dur="4.469">information I&amp;#39;ve been researching in the</text>
  <text start="50.86" dur="6.15">last couple of days as you know I</text>
  <text start="52.809" dur="7.381">recently started talking about some of</text>
  <text start="57.01" dur="7.35">the potential with mining maybe still</text>
  <text start="60.19" dur="6.75">being there maybe the the profits have</text>
  <text start="64.36" dur="4.8">not all been taken maybe there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="66.94" dur="3.87">some upside potential even in the mining</text>
  <text start="69.16" dur="5.459">market which you know has a lot of</text>
  <text start="70.81" dur="8.25">negative to it and you know a big part</text>
  <text start="74.619" dur="5.971">of that is admittedly a huge discount on</text>
  <text start="79.06" dur="4.68">energy and that gives a massive</text>
  <text start="80.59" dur="4.97">competitive event it as you&amp;#39;ll see but</text>
  <text start="83.74" dur="7.41">first I want to talk a little bit about</text>
  <text start="85.56" dur="10.21">my experience in the ico market with</text>
  <text start="91.15" dur="7.079">crypto and you know just the trading in</text>
  <text start="95.77" dur="4.8">general it&amp;#39;s not just the ico market</text>
  <text start="98.229" dur="4.021">obviously that I&amp;#39;ve gotten experience</text>
  <text start="100.57" dur="4.53">and in the crypto space</text>
  <text start="102.25" dur="5.159">but many of you who&amp;#39;ve been following me</text>
  <text start="105.1" dur="5.01">for a while you&amp;#39;ve seen me talk about</text>
  <text start="107.409" dur="4.831">thorne coin Chris SEOs coin F I</text>
  <text start="110.11" dur="3.63">mentioned a few others and I did get</text>
  <text start="112.24" dur="4.379">into Chris iou&amp;#39;s and I did get into</text>
  <text start="113.74" dur="4.769">thorne and both of those although</text>
  <text start="116.619" dur="5.64">foreign is maybe Mike making a comeback</text>
  <text start="118.509" dur="5.82">now both of those taint and you know</text>
  <text start="122.259" dur="3.701">admittedly I lost a little bit of funds</text>
  <text start="124.329" dur="4.091">on those</text>
  <text start="125.96" dur="4.92">and you know I think that I still made a</text>
  <text start="128.42" dur="3.99">good decision overall I think that it</text>
  <text start="130.88" dur="4.74">was kind of inevitable because the</text>
  <text start="132.41" dur="5.73">market tanked right after they funded in</text>
  <text start="135.62" dur="4.71">both cases kind of about the same time</text>
  <text start="138.14" dur="3.93">they had just gotten their startup funds</text>
  <text start="140.33" dur="4.56">and then boom it was worth half as much</text>
  <text start="142.07" dur="5.76">because the market just imploded you</text>
  <text start="144.89" dur="4.89">guys remember that the market and the</text>
  <text start="147.83" dur="3.42">crypto market the regular market and the</text>
  <text start="149.78" dur="4.53">crypto market both imploded pretty</text>
  <text start="151.25" dur="5.22">quickly and you know that would probably</text>
  <text start="154.31" dur="5.55">put any company under that just started</text>
  <text start="156.47" dur="5.13">so that was unfortunate the victim of</text>
  <text start="159.86" dur="5.82">the erratic nature and the volatile</text>
  <text start="161.6" dur="7.08">nature of such a small currently such a</text>
  <text start="165.68" dur="5.309">small part of the economy so it&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="168.68" dur="4.44">know very erratic very volatile because</text>
  <text start="170.989" dur="4.291">it&amp;#39;s such a small just a few hundred</text>
  <text start="173.12" dur="4.92">billion dollars which is just a drop in</text>
  <text start="175.28" dur="5.36">the ocean out there so they failed and I</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="9.27">lost money and you know full disclosure</text>
  <text start="180.64" dur="9.73">that said one success yes I tripled my</text>
  <text start="187.31" dur="5.429">money and I&amp;#39;m more than paid ten times</text>
  <text start="190.37" dur="4.74">more than I lost in those coins now that</text>
  <text start="192.739" dur="3.661">said obviously I I&amp;#39;m no crypto</text>
  <text start="195.11" dur="2.4">millionaire I&amp;#39;m not gonna get on here</text>
  <text start="196.4" dur="4.02">and start bragging of you all the time</text>
  <text start="197.51" dur="5.25">about how I&amp;#39;m rich in crypto even if I</text>
  <text start="200.42" dur="6.03">were her which I&amp;#39;m not and I didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="202.76" dur="6.72">that much in EOS but I did triple what I</text>
  <text start="206.45" dur="4.65">had so so that was really nice that was</text>
  <text start="209.48" dur="2.61">a recent experience and I called it</text>
  <text start="211.1" dur="4.26">pretty well</text>
  <text start="212.09" dur="5.52">EOS is a is my favorite of all of the</text>
  <text start="215.36" dur="4.349">alt coins right now I think it could</text>
  <text start="217.61" dur="5.21">probably take out aetherium in time and</text>
  <text start="219.709" dur="6.871">I see it as far better than even Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="222.82" dur="7.06">but that&amp;#39;s just you know another time</text>
  <text start="226.58" dur="6.21">there the point is that I&amp;#39;ve had some</text>
  <text start="229.88" dur="4.29">losses have had some winds the winds far</text>
  <text start="232.79" dur="3.81">more than made up for the losses and I</text>
  <text start="234.17" dur="4.44">think that&amp;#39;s you know maybe not typical</text>
  <text start="236.6" dur="4.97">but very possible in the crypto space I</text>
  <text start="238.61" dur="6.33">mean you may lose 100% but you may gain</text>
  <text start="241.57" dur="5.259">10,000 percent so he only takes one</text>
  <text start="244.94" dur="4.38">winner to make up for many losers this</text>
  <text start="246.829" dur="5.121">is a very interesting market remember I</text>
  <text start="249.32" dur="5.03">read recently reported that</text>
  <text start="251.95" dur="6.68">the average ico investor which is the</text>
  <text start="254.35" dur="9.45">startup portion of the crypto space is</text>
  <text start="258.63" dur="7.66">making about 82% returns and that&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="263.8" dur="7.23">know that&amp;#39;s a certain portion you know</text>
  <text start="266.29" dur="7.02">if you take out the the people who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="271.03" dur="4.56">get their coin listed on an exchange and</text>
  <text start="273.31" dur="4.14">you take the other people and you just</text>
  <text start="275.59" dur="4.35">count them you&amp;#39;re gonna get a much</text>
  <text start="277.45" dur="4.71">higher like 180 percent kind of one-off</text>
  <text start="279.94" dur="3.42">memory with these numbers but it&amp;#39;s huge</text>
  <text start="282.16" dur="3.21">and this is average this is the average</text>
  <text start="283.36" dur="4.92">investor so we&amp;#39;re gonna talk a little</text>
  <text start="285.37" dur="4.59">bit about what is possible okay</text>
  <text start="288.28" dur="4.68">in the crypto market in the crypto</text>
  <text start="289.96" dur="6.2">mining market and what can you do</text>
  <text start="292.96" dur="5.97">alright so first I want to show you guys</text>
  <text start="296.16" dur="7.59">some of the numbers that I found going</text>
  <text start="298.93" dur="4.82">through alright so here we go</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="8.13">okay this number is the average or turn</text>
  <text start="313.89" dur="5.88">on a BTC minor which is the s9 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.91" dur="2.91">basically the most popular of the</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="2.31">current John rrah</text>
  <text start="320.82" dur="2.61">they get strong it&amp;#39;s just like</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="3.75">cellphones every generation they get</text>
  <text start="323.43" dur="5.25">twice as strong and then the other ones</text>
  <text start="325.83" dur="6.12">are not as good anymore it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="328.68" dur="5.67">fast-paced competitive field but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.95" dur="4.41">obviously there to stay and it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="334.35" dur="3.78">very profitable now in the old days you</text>
  <text start="336.36" dur="3.33">could have made hundreds of bitcoins a</text>
  <text start="338.13" dur="5.01">day and you you know you would have done</text>
  <text start="339.69" dur="4.65">very well if you had just held on like I</text>
  <text start="343.14" dur="4.56">said I don&amp;#39;t think those days are past</text>
  <text start="344.34" dur="6.24">us kryptos market share of the total</text>
  <text start="347.7" dur="5.43">currency space is like one percent as</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="4.8">that grows all of the Kryptos will rise</text>
  <text start="353.13" dur="4.11">that rising tide will lift most boats</text>
  <text start="355.38" dur="4.02">some of the cryptos will go unders</text>
  <text start="357.24" dur="4.53">because they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re obsolete</text>
  <text start="359.4" dur="3.59">or or they are out competed by something</text>
  <text start="361.77" dur="3.899">better</text>
  <text start="362.99" dur="4.54">let the unique things that bring value</text>
  <text start="365.669" dur="4.801">to the community and have decent</text>
  <text start="367.53" dur="5.21">leadership and no major scandals those</text>
  <text start="370.47" dur="4.67">are gonna stick around and grow I think</text>
  <text start="372.74" dur="4.75">and that&amp;#39;s where the research comes in</text>
  <text start="375.14" dur="4.15">you have to know what your you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="3.36">because this is the Wild West you can</text>
  <text start="379.29" dur="4.41">lose all of your money for sure hundred</text>
  <text start="380.85" dur="5.37">percent like I said but getting to the</text>
  <text start="383.7" dur="4.38">picture here let me expand it make it as</text>
  <text start="386.22" dur="5.13">big as I can see that you guys can see</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="5.19">these and in no particular order and I</text>
  <text start="391.35" dur="3.03">don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t have a way to sort that</text>
  <text start="393.27" dur="3.42">right now I&amp;#39;m just gonna go through the</text>
  <text start="394.38" dur="4.32">slides and you can see and I&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="396.69" dur="3.63">about the slide as I get there so this</text>
  <text start="398.7" dur="3.92">is the best one to start with it is the</text>
  <text start="400.32" dur="5.07">average return for the most popular</text>
  <text start="402.62" dur="3.37">Bitcoin miner which is the most popular</text>
  <text start="405.39" dur="3.33">coin</text>
  <text start="405.99" dur="6.179">all right most popular coin most popular</text>
  <text start="408.72" dur="6.03">machine and this is the calculator based</text>
  <text start="412.169" dur="4.741">on average electrical cost for here</text>
  <text start="414.75" dur="5.07">which is about fourteen cent per</text>
  <text start="416.91" dur="5.1">kilowatt hour and based on about the</text>
  <text start="419.82" dur="5.31">power consumption of that machine which</text>
  <text start="422.01" dur="8.64">is a power hog at about 1500 watts give</text>
  <text start="425.13" dur="7.56">or take and it&amp;#39;s its power it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.65" dur="4.019">hashing power which is what you make</text>
  <text start="432.69" dur="3.87">your money on how effective it is at</text>
  <text start="434.669" dur="6.151">making money how much work can it do</text>
  <text start="436.56" dur="5.97">that is at 14 I guess that&amp;#39;s terahertz a</text>
  <text start="440.82" dur="2.97">second so it&amp;#39;s really really powerful</text>
  <text start="442.53" dur="3.18">machine is gonna make a lot of noise</text>
  <text start="443.79" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s gonna produce a lot of heat</text>
  <text start="445.71" dur="5.19">this thing is a moneymaker but your your</text>
  <text start="449.28" dur="4.38">average return on that it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="450.9" dur="5.28">like 42 cent a day at the current price</text>
  <text start="453.66" dur="5.97">of Bitcoin and at the current difficulty</text>
  <text start="456.18" dur="5.46">level for mining which overtime goes up</text>
  <text start="459.63" dur="5.52">so your profits go down and you need</text>
  <text start="461.64" dur="5.73">stronger bigger machines and that said</text>
  <text start="465.15" dur="4.05">you know you don&amp;#39;t maybe want to buy</text>
  <text start="467.37" dur="3.8">something that could overtime go down if</text>
  <text start="469.2" dur="6.719">it&amp;#39;s only making you forty to sin a day</text>
  <text start="471.17" dur="6.999">for a you know $1400 investment that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.919" dur="4.981">$13 a month that&amp;#39;s not good enough</text>
  <text start="478.169" dur="4.911">that&amp;#39;s a hundred and fifty seven ish one</text>
  <text start="480.9" dur="5.07">hundred and fifty six dollars a year</text>
  <text start="483.08" dur="3.97">after electrical costs after you know</text>
  <text start="485.97" dur="3.24">that fifteen hundred dollars you</text>
  <text start="487.05" dur="2.91">invested in the machine that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="489.21" dur="3.209">that impressive</text>
  <text start="489.96" dur="6.6">most people are bad-mouthing the crypto</text>
  <text start="492.419" dur="6.75">market specifically because it&amp;#39;s a I</text>
  <text start="496.56" dur="4.32">should say just them the mining aspect</text>
  <text start="499.169" dur="3.931">of the crypto market specifically</text>
  <text start="500.88" dur="4.02">because of these kind of numbers and you</text>
  <text start="503.1" dur="3.21">can easily do the math yourself with the</text>
  <text start="504.9" dur="6.9">different programs I&amp;#39;ll show you some of</text>
  <text start="506.31" dur="8.34">those as well at the end let&amp;#39;s see let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="511.8" dur="5.4">see let&amp;#39;s see oh this is one I wanted to</text>
  <text start="514.65" dur="6.92">show as a like a commercial at some</text>
  <text start="517.2" dur="7.68">point so we&amp;#39;re gonna cover this anyway</text>
  <text start="521.57" dur="5.88">and there&amp;#39;s my cute dog savior and it</text>
  <text start="524.88" dur="5.52">says YouTube any easy if you want to</text>
  <text start="527.45" dur="5.02">maybe throw a donation my away at donor</text>
  <text start="530.4" dur="4.67">box check out the link below if you</text>
  <text start="532.47" dur="6.69">value the content given this guy a bone</text>
  <text start="535.07" dur="7.99">alright here&amp;#39;s another one this this is</text>
  <text start="539.16" dur="6.32">the etherium miner and this is not at</text>
  <text start="543.06" dur="4.5">regular electrical rates this is at the</text>
  <text start="545.48" dur="6.94">electrical rates that my buddy is gonna</text>
  <text start="547.56" dur="7.49">get at his his crypto farm he gets about</text>
  <text start="552.42" dur="6.84">around half rate is somewhere around</text>
  <text start="555.05" dur="5.83">seven and a half cent to eight cent per</text>
  <text start="559.26" dur="3.96">kilowatt hour</text>
  <text start="560.88" dur="5.43">he has a deal hooked up with a local</text>
  <text start="563.22" dur="6.18">damn hydro plant thing he doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="566.31" dur="4.17">actually buy the electricity I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="569.4" dur="3.27">think they can legally sell the</text>
  <text start="570.48" dur="3.63">electricity at that rate he rents the</text>
  <text start="572.67" dur="4.71">space that&amp;#39;s just hooked up to their</text>
  <text start="574.11" dur="5.09">electricity so very cool and you know I</text>
  <text start="577.38" dur="4.86">talked like I said I&amp;#39;ve talked him into</text>
  <text start="579.2" dur="4.45">hosting some machines for me possibly</text>
  <text start="582.24" dur="5.25">for others I don&amp;#39;t know yet about that</text>
  <text start="583.65" dur="6.36">he kind of wants to keep it low-key but</text>
  <text start="587.49" dur="5.64">this so this opens up an opportunity for</text>
  <text start="590.01" dur="6.38">me because I can actually buy some</text>
  <text start="593.13" dur="5.43">machines put it in his in his farm and</text>
  <text start="596.39" dur="4.24">make the kind of numbers I&amp;#39;m about to</text>
  <text start="598.56" dur="5.07">show you guys but then I could also</text>
  <text start="600.63" dur="5.46">lease out chunks of the machines so you</text>
  <text start="603.63" dur="4.65">guys can win and I can win and he can</text>
  <text start="606.09" dur="4.26">win all because of that really low cost</text>
  <text start="608.28" dur="2.58">electricity let me show you what I mean</text>
  <text start="610.35" dur="2.46">by that</text>
  <text start="610.86" dur="4.62">so in this case I&amp;#39;m gonna zoom in a</text>
  <text start="612.81" dur="4.56">little bit more the etherium miner is</text>
  <text start="615.48" dur="3.96">different in some ways and a little bit</text>
  <text start="617.37" dur="3.87">more profitable than the Bitcoin miner</text>
  <text start="619.44" dur="4.29">at the current numbers and like I said</text>
  <text start="621.24" dur="3.87">aetherium earlier I said in my new show</text>
  <text start="623.73" dur="4.17">aetherium actually just became more</text>
  <text start="625.11" dur="5.07">popular than Bitcoin in total unique</text>
  <text start="627.9" dur="5.04">users okay not in terms of total money</text>
  <text start="630.18" dur="4.38">yet but in terms of total unique users</text>
  <text start="632.94" dur="4.41">and I&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for</text>
  <text start="634.56" dur="4.02">like since I became a huge dipper theory</text>
  <text start="637.35" dur="4.44">was better than Bitcoin in everyway</text>
  <text start="638.58" dur="5.1">period Bitcoin was just their first it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="815.829" dur="4.521">and the difficulty goes up let&amp;#39;s move on</text>
  <text start="821.43" dur="7.93">okay here is what is possible okay if</text>
  <text start="826.899" dur="4.261">you go to the the slightly riskier side</text>
  <text start="829.36" dur="4.11">of things which is the altcoin market</text>
  <text start="831.16" dur="3.96">I&amp;#39;m not talking Bitcoin which is the big</text>

  <text start="846.759" dur="5.731">potential and promise here&amp;#39;s a machine</text>
  <text start="850.3" dur="2.94">example of what you could possibly do</text>
  <text start="852.49" dur="6.3">okay</text>
  <text start="853.24" dur="7.949">this machine is 9,000 bucks okay but a</text>
  <text start="858.79" dur="5.159">current race of this altcoin it makes</text>
  <text start="861.189" dur="7.351">126 bucks a day all right</text>
  <text start="863.949" dur="6.841">that is $45,000 a year all right that</text>
  <text start="868.54" dur="4.2">means this machine for $9,000 plus</text>
  <text start="870.79" dur="4.859">shipping and you have to wait on it to</text>
  <text start="872.74" dur="6.209">pre-order in June all of that at today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="875.649" dur="6.391">rates we pay for itself in about two and</text>
  <text start="878.949" dur="5.981">a half months and then it&amp;#39;s all profit</text>
  <text start="882.04" dur="4.12">all right and you know the electrical</text>
  <text start="884.93" dur="6.75">rate doesn&amp;#39;t make a huge difference here</text>
  <text start="886.16" dur="8.13">because it&amp;#39;s so profitable but a typical</text>
  <text start="891.68" dur="4.65">electric rate in making about 126 a day</text>
  <text start="894.29" dur="5.82">at the discounted rate it would be about</text>
  <text start="896.33" dur="5.19">129 so that&amp;#39;s about the difference in</text>
  <text start="900.11" dur="3.39">electrical rate for such a profitable</text>
  <text start="901.52" dur="3.42">coin but when it gets lower profit then</text>
  <text start="903.5" dur="2.73">it becomes a far more competitive and</text>
  <text start="904.94" dur="3.18">the electrical costs become far more of</text>
  <text start="906.23" dur="3.27">an issue but this is you know this is</text>
  <text start="908.12" dur="5.22">kind of like getting in early on a new</text>
  <text start="909.5" dur="5.85">coin that&amp;#39;s gonna also possibly go up</text>
  <text start="913.34" dur="6.12">just like the coin - you know hundreds</text>
  <text start="915.35" dur="5.52">of percents so that mean that that kind</text>
  <text start="919.46" dur="4.65">of number is is something that could</text>
  <text start="920.87" dur="8.25">make up for mistakes could set you up</text>
  <text start="924.11" dur="7.77">for life possibly could could change</text>
  <text start="929.12" dur="4.95">your situation you know that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="931.88" dur="4.83">thinking I would like to buy with these</text>
  <text start="934.07" dur="5.6">machines if I could probably enough</text>
  <text start="936.71" dur="7.35">having to start with a smaller one and</text>
  <text start="939.67" dur="6.46">this is the let&amp;#39;s see this is the</text>
  <text start="944.06" dur="3.96">regular old Bitcoin just like we started</text>
  <text start="946.13" dur="3.54">with I told you made about 50 cent a day</text>
  <text start="948.02" dur="4.65">a little bit less I think you a little</text>
  <text start="949.67" dur="5.37">bit lesser than 40 something this is the</text>
  <text start="952.67" dur="4.67">same machine most popular machine s9</text>
  <text start="955.04" dur="4.56">with the most popular coin bit coin</text>
  <text start="957.34" dur="5.2">everything is the same except this is</text>
  <text start="959.6" dur="4.89">the half by electric cost so now it&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="962.54" dur="5.34">to about three dollars a day so if this</text>
  <text start="964.49" dur="5.43">more competitive stage you can tell the</text>
  <text start="967.88" dur="3.75">electrical cost is huge right and it</text>
  <text start="969.92" dur="4.5">makes it&amp;#39;s like the time six more profit</text>
  <text start="971.63" dur="5.43">now so this is what I can tap into</text>
  <text start="974.42" dur="5.91">because I got the connection with the</text>
  <text start="977.06" dur="5.37">hydro down all right this is uh I just</text>
  <text start="980.33" dur="3.57">got lucky and I saw a connection and my</text>
  <text start="982.43" dur="3.27">friend was already doing mining and then</text>
  <text start="983.9" dur="4.35">BOOM this is this is kind of a cool</text>
  <text start="985.7" dur="3.6">situation so I wanted to jump into it</text>
  <text start="988.25" dur="3.98">and I&amp;#39;ve been pretty obsessively</text>
  <text start="989.3" dur="4.89">researching the market for days now</text>
  <text start="992.23" dur="3.76">fortunately in the news have been a</text>
  <text start="994.19" dur="4.95">little quiet so I&amp;#39;ve had that extra time</text>
  <text start="995.99" dur="5.4">to research and bring you guys this so</text>
  <text start="999.14" dur="4.47">is this is nice this is really very</text>
  <text start="1001.39" dur="3.39">profitable this is and now you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1003.61" dur="1.53">looking at about a thousand dollars a</text>
  <text start="1004.78" dur="2.23">year</text>
  <text start="1005.14" dur="5.29">this machine is about 13</text>
  <text start="1007.01" dur="6.03">$1400 that&amp;#39;s not bad</text>
  <text start="1010.43" dur="7.05">you know that&amp;#39;s this Colo search 100%</text>
  <text start="1013.04" dur="7.97">right there let&amp;#39;s see if there&amp;#39;s any</text>
  <text start="1017.48" dur="3.53">other I think that&amp;#39;s most of them there</text>
  <text start="1022.37" dur="4.1">I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on my check</text>
  <text start="1024.079" dur="2.391">mark here</text>
  <text start="1029.91" dur="3.539">that&amp;#39;s it anyway</text>
  <text start="1037.089" dur="6.151">yep that&amp;#39;s it for that so going back to</text>
  <text start="1040.509" dur="4.74">my notes here see crypto mining profit</text>
  <text start="1043.24" dur="5.549">projection these figures are for about</text>
  <text start="1045.249" dur="4.5">six one six to eighteen they are going</text>
  <text start="1048.789" dur="2.401">to change okay</text>
  <text start="1049.749" dur="3.51">and if you&amp;#39;ve watched this later down</text>
  <text start="1051.19" dur="4.26">the road you have an interesting</text>
  <text start="1053.259" dur="6.78">perspective in hindsight you can go back</text>
  <text start="1055.45" dur="6.299">and see how I did now I want to talk</text>
  <text start="1060.039" dur="3.24">about nice hash because this isn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="1061.749" dur="4.38">very interesting program all right nice</text>
  <text start="1063.279" dur="5.671">hash is this very easy to use program</text>
  <text start="1066.129" dur="5.611">and very simple to download you can run</text>
  <text start="1068.95" dur="4.62">it on any computer it doesn&amp;#39;t do very</text>
  <text start="1071.74" dur="3.09">well if you have a weak computer you</text>
  <text start="1073.57" dur="3.569">know kind of like mine here obviously</text>
  <text start="1074.83" dur="3.87">I&amp;#39;ve got $0.65 and this has been like</text>
  <text start="1077.139" dur="4.17">four days worth of mining so it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1078.7" dur="4.02">hugely profitable or anything if you</text>
  <text start="1081.309" dur="4.021">have many computers or if you have a</text>

  <text start="1090.039" dur="3.421">be profitable many people were able to</text>
  <text start="1091.84" dur="4.35">do this with gaming machines make about</text>
  <text start="1093.46" dur="4.86">eight or nine dollars a day the the neat</text>
  <text start="1096.19" dur="3.9">thing about Mac nice hash is it makes it</text>
  <text start="1098.32" dur="3.329">simple makes it easy because it does all</text>
  <text start="1100.09" dur="4.74">the work for you and in mines for you</text>
  <text start="1101.649" dur="6.12">it&amp;#39;s not exactly mining for you though</text>
  <text start="1104.83" dur="4.319">they use your mining power they pull it</text>
  <text start="1107.769" dur="2.79">together and then they sell that to</text>
  <text start="1109.149" dur="3.03">other miners who don&amp;#39;t have their own</text>
  <text start="1110.559" dur="3.45">miner they just want to purchase mining</text>
  <text start="1112.179" dur="3.45">power which is a whole nother of field</text>
  <text start="1114.009" dur="5.28">and usually not profitable but people</text>
  <text start="1115.629" dur="6.961">try and it kind of switches you in</text>
  <text start="1119.289" dur="5.13">effect to the most profitable coin every</text>
  <text start="1122.59" dur="4.35">few minutes era or whenever you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1124.419" dur="5.551">you&amp;#39;re hashing power is sold to a client</text>
  <text start="1126.94" dur="5.459">and that kind of takes all of the work</text>
  <text start="1129.97" dur="4.679">of picking the best coin out for you you</text>
  <text start="1132.399" dur="3.87">could buy a computer set it up on this</text>

  <text start="1136.269" dur="4.38">day and their little fee is not too bad</text>
  <text start="1137.919" dur="4.171">in generally often you can actually stay</text>

  <text start="1232.26" dur="6.75">be your video card maybe I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1236.82" dur="4.68">a slight difference between GPU and the</text>

  <text start="1241.5" dur="5.42">understand all the difference basically</text>
  <text start="1244.05" dur="5.43">what you need to understand is that</text>
  <text start="1246.92" dur="4.9">Bitcoin and other and certain other</text>
  <text start="1249.48" dur="4.02">Kryptos are so competitive that they</text>

  <text start="1283.14" dur="3.33">would buy a GPU</text>
  <text start="1284.04" dur="4.17">set up instead of an ASIC to set up and</text>
  <text start="1286.47" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s a little bit different</text>
  <text start="1288.21" dur="4.74">probably more resale ability and ASIC is</text>
