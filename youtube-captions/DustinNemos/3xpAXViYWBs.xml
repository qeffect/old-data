  <text start="173.01" dur="4.32">into the news now representative</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="3.81">Ratcliffe kind of bought out what</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="4.71">everyone was already thinking at least</text>
  <text start="178.98" dur="5.61">and can&amp;#39;t say because of classified you</text>
  <text start="182.04" dur="4.02">know excuses at this point that&amp;#39;s all it</text>
  <text start="184.59" dur="3.09">really is they classify things that they</text>
  <text start="186.06" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t want the public to know so that</text>
  <text start="187.68" dur="5.43">they can selectively leak like really</text>
  <text start="190.53" dur="5.4">cut out or clipped out fragments or even</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="4.95">lie out outright lie like jeff has</text>
  <text start="195.93" dur="4.41">already tried to do with a misquoting</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="3.72">president Trump&amp;#39;s phone call reading it</text>
  <text start="200.34" dur="3.179">into the official record and everything</text>
  <text start="201.78" dur="3.63">so let&amp;#39;s go through what we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="203.519" dur="4.051">about here now you guys have already</text>
  <text start="205.41" dur="4.95">heard I&amp;#39;ve already reported on IC IG</text>
  <text start="207.57" dur="7.11">Michael Atkinson having tampered with</text>
  <text start="210.36" dur="6.9">the whistleblower rules so that they</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="5.369">could in you know admit hearsay or</text>
  <text start="217.26" dur="4.14">rumors or even go after a president</text>
  <text start="220.049" dur="3.151">who&amp;#39;s not part of the intelligence</text>
  <text start="221.4" dur="4.08">community which is kind of outside the</text>
  <text start="223.2" dur="4.65">purview of what a whistleblower would be</text>
  <text start="225.48" dur="4.229">doing in this case and and basically not</text>
  <text start="227.85" dur="3.78">really it whistle blower right so</text>
  <text start="229.709" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re changing the rules to</text>
  <text start="231.63" dur="5.46">allow shenanigans and shadiness to take</text>
  <text start="234.359" dur="4.531">place and dishonesty now of course</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="5.73">that&amp;#39;s not a surprise that&amp;#39;s the swamp</text>
  <text start="238.89" dur="6.48">but in this case this came up in a</text>
  <text start="242.82" dur="4.86">testimony closed-door of course because</text>
  <text start="245.37" dur="3.75">this is one of those things that Schiff</text>
  <text start="247.68" dur="3.089">was doing it first in the bunker</text>
  <text start="249.12" dur="4.649">underneath Capitol Hill you remember</text>
  <text start="250.769" dur="5.4">everything was closed off behind behind</text>
  <text start="253.769" dur="3.421">security perimeters and and I think it</text>
  <text start="256.169" dur="4.051">was</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="5.25">even a what do they call it AI CIF or</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="5.01">whatever it is the the highly secure</text>
  <text start="262.44" dur="5.19">vault kind of secure information where</text>
  <text start="265.23" dur="6.96">they basically were in a vault or a</text>
  <text start="267.63" dur="7.23">fortress now he had a testimony from</text>
  <text start="272.19" dur="5.01">Lanka lacan seen here and Michael had</text>
  <text start="274.86" dur="3.75">answered a very specific question and</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m kind of building up to</text>
  <text start="278.61" dur="4.74">here so let me explain</text>
  <text start="281.28" dur="3.36">and of course of all of the different</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="2.73">testimonies that have already been</text>
  <text start="284.64" dur="3.6">released this is the one that they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="307.26" dur="5.64">Schiff is hiding the transcripts here</text>
  <text start="310.83" dur="4.98">here he&amp;#39;s responding in a tweet from</text>
  <text start="312.9" dur="4.11">Paul Sperry so he asked this week quote</text>

  <text start="330.3" dur="5.67">connection to obama officials including</text>
  <text start="332.22" dur="5.46">david Loughman and then of course we</text>
  <text start="335.97" dur="3.78">already knew who the whistleblower is</text>
  <text start="337.68" dur="3.84">and i can&amp;#39;t say his name or or to be</text>
  <text start="339.75" dur="5.42">suspended on youtube i&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="351.21" dur="4.38">Sperry here on Twitter and he says I</text>
  <text start="353.73" dur="4.53">know why Paul Sperry it&amp;#39;s because I</text>
  <text start="355.59" dur="4.77">asked i G Atkinson about his quote</text>
  <text start="358.26" dur="4.23">investigation and a quote into the</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="3.33">contacts between shifts staff and the</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="3.21">person who later became the</text>
  <text start="363.69" dur="4.59">whistleblower the transcript is</text>
  <text start="365.7" dur="4.32">classified quote secret in quote so</text>
  <text start="368.28" dur="4.92">Schiff can prevent you from seeing the</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="6.27">answers to my questions so that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="373.2" dur="5.13">telling about what was going on here</text>
  <text start="376.29" dur="4.38">about the whistleblower having already</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="4.59">been in touch with shifts and of course</text>
  <text start="380.67" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s he lied about that in his</text>
  <text start="382.92" dur="3.39">complaint tried to change it later and</text>
  <text start="384.66" dur="3.33">then Schiff has lied about it as well</text>
  <text start="386.31" dur="3.99">and of course there&amp;#39;s connections</text>
  <text start="387.99" dur="3">between his staff and this guy is this</text>
  <text start="390.3" dur="3.269">former friend</text>
  <text start="390.99" dur="4.2">and then George Soros connections to</text>
  <text start="393.569" dur="3.991">this guy and in the White House under</text>
  <text start="395.19" dur="5.46">Obama&amp;#39;s watch and it just goes on and on</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="5.669">and on - just a murky swamp of treason</text>
  <text start="400.65" dur="4.71">doesn&amp;#39;t it so continuing on a little bit</text>
  <text start="403.229" dur="4.171">we&amp;#39;re also going to talk about quote the</text>
  <text start="405.36" dur="4.08">first person who needs to testify is</text>
  <text start="407.4" dur="5.549">Adam Schiff end quote</text>
  <text start="409.44" dur="6.24">now that&amp;#39;s a GOP ringleader on Judiciary</text>
  <text start="412.949" dur="4.65">Committee Doug Collins this guy is</text>

  <text start="419.58" dur="3.78">testifying we&amp;#39;re gonna actually call</text>
  <text start="421.139" dur="4.891">Adam Schiff himself and I imagine that</text>
  <text start="423.36" dur="5.13">this also means Biden as well hunter</text>
  <text start="426.03" dur="4.319">Biden and maybe even Joe Biden because</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="4.97">they have a lot to bring to this</text>
  <text start="430.349" dur="5.63">firsthand witness firsthand evidence</text>
  <text start="433.46" dur="5.2">possibly criminals themselves of course</text>
  <text start="435.979" dur="4.631">so we don&amp;#39;t we all want to see the</text>
  <text start="438.66" dur="3.72">answers to that question but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="440.61" dur="4.08">trying to not do that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="442.38" dur="5.43">drum up something and that&amp;#39;s failing on</text>

  <text start="458.49" dur="2.85">go through with it</text>
  <text start="459.389" dur="4.291">30 plus Democrats are gonna lose their</text>

  <text start="501.75" dur="3.659">in cash and still have tens of millions</text>
  <text start="503.82" dur="3.93">in debt and there&amp;#39;s a difference between</text>
  <text start="505.409" dur="5.1">good debt and bad debt so if that&amp;#39;s the</text>

  <text start="539.76" dur="5.49">has no monthly income well again that</text>
  <text start="543.54" dur="3.21">maybe it&amp;#39;s a quarterly income from</text>
  <text start="545.25" dur="3.15">dividends or something because he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="573.3" dur="6.24">point that&amp;#39;s not even being mean but</text>
  <text start="575.49" dur="5.97">this this woman is taking a lot of risk</text>
  <text start="579.54" dur="4.74">I would say going against these powerful</text>

  <text start="1169.859" dur="4.961">that we can&amp;#39;t let China just crush</text>
  <text start="1173.019" dur="3.63">without mentioning it I&amp;#39;m probably going</text>
  <text start="1174.82" dur="4.38">to get on all the lists for this one and</text>
  <text start="1176.649" dur="3.39">you know that includes people in the USA</text>
  <text start="1179.2" dur="3.479">that act against</text>
  <text start="1180.039" dur="4.98">the Chinese enemies here and stuff like</text>
  <text start="1182.679" dur="3.63">that you know like the NF you should</text>
  <text start="1185.019" dur="5.66">look at the NFL coaches when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1186.309" dur="4.37">asked about Chinese human rights abuses</text>
  <text start="1191.039" dur="5.08">anyway so I just want to bring attention</text>
  <text start="1193.779" dur="4.321">to this because it&amp;#39;s a big deal that</text>
  <text start="1196.119" dur="4.351">they&amp;#39;re allowed to in and yes there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1198.1" dur="3.6">violence the police started it just like</text>
  <text start="1200.47" dur="3.99">with the yellow vests but there have</text>
  <text start="1201.7" dur="4.229">been violent groups within the larger</text>
  <text start="1204.46" dur="2.909">hole that are starting violence with the</text>
  <text start="1205.929" dur="3.36">police and then throwing you know</text>
  <text start="1207.369" dur="4.44">explosives and such and that nature and</text>
  <text start="1209.289" dur="3.72">hey I&amp;#39;m not for that I&amp;#39;m not supporting</text>
  <text start="1211.809" dur="3.48">that and I think they&amp;#39;re there to make</text>
  <text start="1213.009" dur="3.931">the actual protesters look bad because</text>
  <text start="1215.289" dur="5.281">largely they&amp;#39;ve been very peaceful</text>
  <text start="1216.94" dur="6">protests and you know how George Soros</text>
  <text start="1220.57" dur="4.979">and the SIOP types go they&amp;#39;ll use agent</text>
  <text start="1222.94" dur="5.819">provocateurs to insert into crowds and</text>
  <text start="1225.549" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;ll try to egg on large groups to do</text>
  <text start="1228.759" dur="3.24">violent acts or maybe they&amp;#39;ll throw the</text>
  <text start="1230.32" dur="3.449">first brick or something like that to</text>
  <text start="1231.999" dur="5.28">get things really riled up and they</text>
  <text start="1233.769" dur="5.13">might be on both sides of that but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1237.279" dur="5">just you know kind of been closing here</text>
  <text start="1238.899" dur="6.72">is interesting to see it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="1242.279" dur="5.32">cultural attack it&amp;#39;s a cultural whammy</text>
  <text start="1245.619" dur="3.841">that Trump just did to them and now</text>
  <text start="1247.599" dur="4.02">China is trying to figure out how to</text>
  <text start="1249.46" dur="6.719">react to this without looking weak which</text>
  <text start="1251.619" dur="6.75">is gonna be very difficult now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1256.179" dur="5.791">know what&amp;#39;s gonna happen I pray for the</text>
  <text start="1258.369" dur="8.94">best with China I hope for the best but</text>
  <text start="1261.97" dur="6.629">this it&amp;#39;s all of my historical instincts</text>
  <text start="1267.309" dur="4.44">would say we are on the verge of World</text>
  <text start="1268.599" dur="7.44">War 3 right now with with economic</text>
  <text start="1271.749" dur="5.85">warfare almost into currency war that</text>
  <text start="1276.039" dur="3.81">would be the next step it would be a hot</text>
  <text start="1277.599" dur="3.54">war after that we have a cultural war</text>
  <text start="1279.849" dur="3.361">already going on with China they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1281.139" dur="4.23">calling us racists we&amp;#39;re calling them</text>
  <text start="1283.21" dur="3.36">out for human rights abuses it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1285.369" dur="4.56">interesting they&amp;#39;re using the leftist</text>
  <text start="1286.57" dur="5.069">talking points now and and of course the</text>
  <text start="1289.929" dur="4.141">rest of the world is sort of taking</text>
  <text start="1291.639" dur="4.321">sides and we haven&amp;#39;t won too many</text>
  <text start="1294.07" dur="4.799">friends in the past and now a lot of</text>
  <text start="1295.96" dur="5.73">people are very offended because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1298.869" dur="4.73">globalist and Trump is not so people are</text>
  <text start="1301.69" dur="5.339">abandoning the dollar there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1303.599" dur="5.471">polarized world coming with kind of a</text>
  <text start="1307.029" dur="5.52">dual system the Western system that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1309.07" dur="4.04">being largely abandoned in droves and</text>
  <text start="1312.549" dur="2.63">the new</text>
  <text start="1313.11" dur="4.02">lock system from the east with Russia</text>
  <text start="1315.179" dur="4.591">and China and the BRICS nations and and</text>
  <text start="1317.13" dur="4.47">whatever kind of crypto backed by gold</text>
  <text start="1319.77" dur="4.38">that they come up with which I suspect</text>
  <text start="1321.6" dur="3.959">is next but very much not a crypto it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1324.15" dur="4.17">more of a digital currency have one</text>
  <text start="1325.559" dur="6.211">people about that and then of course on</text>
  <text start="1328.32" dur="5.4">on the western side here we have I mean</text>
  <text start="1331.77" dur="3.57">we have some major economic whammies</text>
  <text start="1333.72" dur="4.62">coming ourselves that I think the</text>
  <text start="1335.34" dur="5.219">breakdown of Social Security Medicare I</text>
  <text start="1338.34" dur="6">think the a lot of the pensions are</text>
  <text start="1340.559" dur="6.031">unfunded or will be in really bad shape</text>
  <text start="1344.34" dur="4.17">soon I think the stock market is going</text>
  <text start="1346.59" dur="3.39">to implode I mean most of these</text>
  <text start="1348.51" dur="3.36">companies aren&amp;#39;t even earning income a</text>
  <text start="1349.98" dur="3.03">lot of them are just selling hope of</text>
  <text start="1351.87" dur="3.299">income in the future</text>
  <text start="1353.01" dur="6.45">it&amp;#39;s getting pretty much peak bubble</text>
  <text start="1355.169" dur="6.331">levels and there everything is</text>
  <text start="1359.46" dur="3.77">hypothecated in the in the stock market</text>
  <text start="1361.5" dur="4.11">as well and they&amp;#39;re just pretty much</text>
  <text start="1363.23" dur="4.329">getting stimulus money and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1365.61" dur="3.42">keeping them going so everything is in a</text>
  <text start="1367.559" dur="3.661">bubble a lot of people are warning about</text>
  <text start="1369.03" dur="5.58">that and everything is really pointing</text>
  <text start="1371.22" dur="5.16">to a climax in the next year or two so I</text>
  <text start="1374.61" dur="4.05">want people to be ready and be you know</text>
  <text start="1376.38" dur="4.38">warned about that I know you hear a lot</text>
  <text start="1378.66" dur="4.13">of good news about the economy and you</text>
  <text start="1380.76" dur="4.08">know you hear a lot of positive things</text>
  <text start="1382.79" dur="5.379">because of all the record after record</text>
  <text start="1384.84" dur="4.92">after record there&amp;#39;s two things to that</text>
  <text start="1388.169" dur="3.241">one those are real records because</text>
  <text start="1389.76" dur="3.03">that&amp;#39;s what happens in a bubble okay</text>
  <text start="1391.41" dur="3.87">everything gets record record record</text>
  <text start="1392.79" dur="4.379">right and then twice as good as it was</text>
  <text start="1395.28" dur="4.71">two years ago that kind of that kind of</text>
  <text start="1397.169" dur="5.491">unrealistic growth it&amp;#39;s not all Trump</text>
  <text start="1399.99" dur="4.59">but secondly he&amp;#39;s trying to buy us time</text>
  <text start="1402.66" dur="3.78">because the banks have been bailed out</text>
  <text start="1404.58" dur="3.51">the big guys have been bailed out now</text>
  <text start="1406.44" dur="3.18">there&amp;#39;s a little bit of time to prepare</text>
  <text start="1408.09" dur="3.69">for those who are getting ready those</text>
  <text start="1409.62" dur="4.2">who have information that they need to</text>
  <text start="1411.78" dur="3.96">be ready for the next thing which is</text>
  <text start="1413.82" dur="4.32">probably going to be a gold standard or</text>
  <text start="1415.74" dur="4.41">probably really a gold backed dollar</text>
  <text start="1418.14" dur="3.72">equivalent and then that&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="1420.15" dur="3.06">eventually cheated and devalued and</text>
  <text start="1421.86" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re gonna remove the goal for that</text>
  <text start="1423.21" dur="5.49">too but something that has gold to it</text>
  <text start="1425.49" dur="4.92">because you don&amp;#39;t go from fiat currency</text>
  <text start="1428.7" dur="3.69">to fiat currency you can&amp;#39;t just keep</text>
  <text start="1430.41" dur="3.509">moving zeros around the eventually you</text>
  <text start="1432.39" dur="5.13">need a hard reset you need to come to</text>
  <text start="1433.919" dur="6.241">reality and this this is a peak crazy</text>
  <text start="1437.52" dur="7.58">credit crisis as well so the debts</text>
  <text start="1440.16" dur="4.94">unsustainable the IR you know the</text>
  <text start="1445.179" dur="7.901">the Baba all of the 401ks are</text>
  <text start="1450.86" dur="4.319">unsustainable the IRAs I think is what</text>
  <text start="1453.08" dur="4.11">doesn&amp;#39;t say a lot of these things are</text>
  <text start="1455.179" dur="3.541">are terrible different investment</text>
  <text start="1457.19" dur="5.67">vehicles and then there of course at</text>
  <text start="1458.72" dur="6.51">risk and you know many times they sell</text>
  <text start="1462.86" dur="4.14">in the ETF&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1465.23" dur="4.079">there&amp;#39;s another one I was gonna say a</text>
  <text start="1467" dur="4.29">lot of times they&amp;#39;ll sell a hundred</text>
  <text start="1469.309" dur="5.011">times or two or three hundred times the</text>
  <text start="1471.29" dur="5.6">equivalent of underlying physical so you</text>
  <text start="1474.32" dur="5.609">have one silver house on storage maybe</text>
  <text start="1476.89" dur="5.2">and then you probably owe it to someone</text>
  <text start="1479.929" dur="4.051">and then you sell three hundred ounces</text>
  <text start="1482.09" dur="4.74">of paper contracts to say that you have</text>
  <text start="1483.98" dur="5.1">sold 300 ounces of silver that&amp;#39;s typical</text>
  <text start="1486.83" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s normal when things get bad and</text>
  <text start="1489.08" dur="3.93">things have gotten bad in the past in</text>
  <text start="1490.79" dur="3.69">this country where people were valuing</text>

  <text start="1501.89" dur="4.56">understand it - holy cow I need to find</text>
  <text start="1504.65" dur="3.75">every ounce of it so that I can so that</text>
  <text start="1506.45" dur="3.93">I can get the value out of that because</text>
  <text start="1508.4" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s so much more valuable once people</text>
  <text start="1510.38" dur="4.679">realize that so gold and silver Patriot</text>
