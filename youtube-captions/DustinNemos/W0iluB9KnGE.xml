  <text start="81.02" dur="4.62">and freedom of speech is kind of the one</text>
  <text start="83.539" dur="3.541">thing where everyone can sort of agree</text>
  <text start="85.64" dur="4.17">on or unite behind</text>
  <text start="87.08" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s a roundtable that unites the tribes</text>
  <text start="89.81" dur="5.52">so to speak if you will again against</text>
  <text start="92.75" dur="4.049">censorship which is the enemy it unites</text>
  <text start="95.33" dur="4.109">all of the small and scattered voices</text>
  <text start="96.799" dur="5.101">that have no hope currently to take on</text>
  <text start="99.439" dur="3.93">the Goliath Google and the other big</text>
  <text start="101.9" dur="2.789">tech companies that are censoring our</text>
  <text start="103.369" dur="4.921">way of life our freedom of speech</text>
  <text start="104.689" dur="7.381">destroying our country taking away 2020</text>
  <text start="108.29" dur="6.689">from us so what&amp;#39;s next and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="112.07" dur="5.159">happened so far well so far we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="114.979" dur="4.951">retained Super Lawyer Todd McMurtry of</text>
  <text start="117.229" dur="3.96">the Covington students Fame you know he</text>
  <text start="119.93" dur="2.88">helped defend the some of the Covington</text>
  <text start="121.189" dur="3.93">students against the mainstream media&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.81" dur="4.41">you know almost I would say violent</text>
  <text start="125.119" dur="3.691">attacks you know at least rhetoric but</text>
  <text start="127.22" dur="3.72">the rhetoric leads to violence in some</text>
  <text start="128.81" dur="4.2">cases so you know great damage was done</text>
  <text start="130.94" dur="4.139">to these poor kids futures their</text>
  <text start="133.01" dur="4.17">reputations I mean it&amp;#39;s a form of</text>
  <text start="135.079" dur="3.841">violence in itself the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="137.18" dur="4.369">came down on these kids really hard and</text>
  <text start="138.92" dur="6.81">who stood up for them Todd McMurtry did</text>
  <text start="141.549" dur="5.981">now he is our attorney why because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145.73" dur="4.349">got a history of standing up against</text>
  <text start="147.53" dur="4.98">bullies and doing the right thing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="150.079" dur="4.851">also a free speech advocate and expert</text>
  <text start="152.51" dur="4.64">so he&amp;#39;s the right guy for the job</text>
  <text start="154.93" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;ve also retained him</text>
  <text start="157.15" dur="3.899">to explore the potential for a</text>
  <text start="158.95" dur="5.16">class-action or other forms of legal</text>
  <text start="161.049" dur="5.91">action against big tech for censoring</text>
  <text start="164.11" dur="4.95">the goal is to end censorship in America</text>
  <text start="166.959" dur="4.021">not to make money or not to punish</text>
  <text start="169.06" dur="3.48">Google or anything else although you</text>
  <text start="170.98" dur="4.979">know punishing Google sounds nice at</text>
  <text start="172.54" dur="6.869">least but the goal here is to stop them</text>
  <text start="175.959" dur="5.31">from stopping us to stop them from bit</text>
  <text start="179.409" dur="3.961">burning or erasing us from the Internet</text>
  <text start="181.269" dur="4.59">which they are doing more and more than</text>
  <text start="183.37" dur="4.949">ever my channel one of many stories on</text>
  <text start="185.859" dur="4.111">YouTube has been frozen just short of a</text>
  <text start="188.319" dur="3.961">hundred thousand subscribers for nearly</text>
  <text start="189.97" dur="4.799">a year now because they don&amp;#39;t want you</text>
  <text start="192.28" dur="5.129">to hear what I have to say the algorithm</text>
  <text start="194.769" dur="5.541">the D boosting the D platforming the D</text>
  <text start="197.409" dur="5.431">monetization shadow banning all of it</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="4.209">you know I&amp;#39;m on the deep end there but</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="3.78">I&amp;#39;m not alone here many others are out</text>
  <text start="204.519" dur="3.09">there as well and many of them don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="206.62" dur="4.589">know what to do</text>
  <text start="207.609" dur="5.931">well stop it burning calm could be that</text>
  <text start="211.209" dur="5.73">solution if enough of us get together</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="5.86">combine our voices censored or</text>
  <text start="216.939" dur="4.041">independent or whatever they may be we</text>
  <text start="219.4" dur="3.54">can make a pretty loud raucous</text>
  <text start="220.98" dur="4.509">politically speaking I think we could</text>
  <text start="222.94" dur="5.79">create a movement to stop censorship to</text>
  <text start="225.489" dur="6.06">stop the bit burning now we&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="228.73" dur="5.39">recent meet-up if you will I called it</text>
  <text start="231.549" dur="5.34">the stop that burning calm war summit</text>
  <text start="234.12" dur="5.289">but what it was was a conversation</text>
  <text start="236.889" dur="4.981">between the attorney myself and over a</text>
  <text start="239.409" dur="5.58">dozen other independent voices who have</text>
  <text start="241.87" dur="5.549">a region and millions so it&amp;#39;s not just a</text>
  <text start="244.989" dur="5.22">fickle idea it&amp;#39;s not just you know a</text>
  <text start="247.419" dur="4.56">website this is already a movement that</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="3.9">has potential to reach millions of</text>
  <text start="251.979" dur="3.48">people now people are still discussing</text>
  <text start="254.109" dur="2.85">if they don&amp;#39;t know what to do they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="255.459" dur="3.5">know if they should commit to something</text>
  <text start="256.959" dur="4.5">that can get them banned or punished or</text>
  <text start="258.959" dur="5.14">retaliated against in some way by big</text>
  <text start="261.459" dur="3.751">tech and I&amp;#39;m here to say they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="264.099" dur="2.971">doing that to us</text>
  <text start="265.21" dur="4.019">they&amp;#39;re already punishing us and erasing</text>
  <text start="267.07" dur="3.45">us as quickly as they can and there are</text>
  <text start="269.229" dur="3.031">consequences to what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="270.52" dur="3.06">people are starting to wake up to it</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s why they have to go very</text>
  <text start="273.58" dur="4.38">carefully and together we can make</text>
  <text start="276.28" dur="3.48">enough of a voice that they can&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="277.96" dur="4.29">ban us we could control the Streisand</text>
  <text start="279.76" dur="3.689">effect if they were to ban someone in</text>
  <text start="282.25" dur="3.15">the hundred other youtubers or</text>
  <text start="283.449" dur="4.111">influencers or alternative media were to</text>
  <text start="285.4" dur="4.389">mention it and talk about it that person</text>
  <text start="287.56" dur="5.629">would be three times bigger the next day</text>
  <text start="289.789" dur="5.71">very soon censorship will fail and when</text>
  <text start="293.189" dur="4.921">that happens whether it&amp;#39;s through stop</text>
  <text start="295.499" dur="4.41">at burning calm or something else we</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="4.679">will have a even playing ground a fair</text>
  <text start="299.909" dur="4.44">fighting ground with mainstream media</text>
  <text start="302.789" dur="3.421">when it comes to the truth when it comes</text>
  <text start="304.349" dur="3.75">to the rhetoric and the narrative and</text>
  <text start="306.21" dur="4.439">getting the word out about what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="308.099" dur="5.31">happening we will have equal footing in</text>
  <text start="310.649" dur="5.311">the battle round of ideas exactly where</text>
  <text start="313.409" dur="3.75">we want to be where we need to be now</text>
  <text start="315.96" dur="3.359">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to make it look like</text>
  <text start="317.159" dur="4.051">we&amp;#39;re evil or violent or or extremists</text>
  <text start="319.319" dur="3.8">or terrorists or whatever or racist or</text>
  <text start="321.21" dur="4.259">you know any of the other s or isms</text>
  <text start="323.119" dur="5.86">because they can&amp;#39;t compete with us on</text>
  <text start="325.469" dur="7.17">the even playing ground of debate reason</text>
  <text start="328.979" dur="5.25">logic truth and evidence also I would</text>
  <text start="332.639" dur="2.971">say of compassion they&amp;#39;re not very</text>
  <text start="334.229" dur="3.18">compassionate people they just pretend</text>
  <text start="335.61" dur="3.989">to be on the left to to try to</text>
  <text start="337.409" dur="4.22">especially the mainstream media to try</text>
  <text start="339.599" dur="6.12">to take advantage of and exploit others</text>
  <text start="341.629" dur="6.19">so in closing this is an invitation if</text>

  <text start="453.97" dur="5.49">like the preggers u the Loomer all of</text>

  <text start="459.46" dur="4.53">we have the best chance here now with</text>
  <text start="462.34" dur="3.96">this case because there were some things</text>
  <text start="463.99" dur="5.28">that no one else has tried yet and maybe</text>
  <text start="466.3" dur="4.95">just maybe we can win so between the</text>
  <text start="469.27" dur="4.23">conversation that&amp;#39;s going on now between</text>
  <text start="471.25" dur="4.65">these alternative media people these</text>

  <text start="482.56" dur="4.89">themselves but know people who do the</text>
  <text start="484.96" dur="4.92">word is spreading and if we were to go</text>
  <text start="487.45" dur="4.08">from for example a dozen independent</text>
  <text start="489.88" dur="4.17">voices with a reach within two to three</text>
  <text start="491.53" dur="4.5">million total to a fifty to a hundred</text>
  <text start="494.05" dur="3.96">independent voices with a reach in the</text>
  <text start="496.03" dur="3.6">twenty to thirty million range I think</text>
  <text start="498.01" dur="4.65">we could do this I think we have a shot</text>
  <text start="499.63" dur="5.31">and that&amp;#39;s as simple as inviting a few</text>
