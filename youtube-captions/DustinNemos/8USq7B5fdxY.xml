  <text start="33.18" dur="6.12">spreading the wrong message going</text>
  <text start="36.45" dur="5.64">against the movement he&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="39.3" dur="6.36">implying that we need to let obama and</text>
  <text start="42.09" dur="5.969">hillary go if the right wants to grow</text>
  <text start="45.66" dur="5.19">whatever what whatever that means so</text>
  <text start="48.059" dur="4.561">he&amp;#39;s actually trying to say that we</text>
  <text start="50.85" dur="3.72">should forgo justice and make</text>
  <text start="52.62" dur="6.3">compromises even though we&amp;#39;re winning</text>
  <text start="54.57" dur="5.879">across the board non-stop we know his</text>
  <text start="58.92" dur="3.18">position on the real truth we know his</text>

  <text start="62.1" dur="4.5">know his position on the child</text>
  <text start="63.329" dur="5.131">trafficking stuff at the end of the day</text>
  <text start="66.6" dur="4.23">we know he&amp;#39;s an outright liar he</text>
  <text start="68.46" dur="5.519">actually fabricates evidence with these</text>
  <text start="70.83" dur="5.16">fake chat logs things like that relies</text>
  <text start="73.979" dur="6.511">on really shady people for his McCue</text>
  <text start="75.99" dur="6.84">debunk like micro chap who&amp;#39;s literally</text>
  <text start="80.49" dur="5.16">has the emotional maturity of a you know</text>
  <text start="82.83" dur="6.149">a an angry anonymous twelve-year-old on</text>
  <text start="85.65" dur="5.73">a video game that was just beaten so not</text>
  <text start="88.979" dur="4.591">a not a great person to build your</text>
  <text start="91.38" dur="3.96">entire anti key foundation on and of</text>
  <text start="93.57" dur="3.479">course a none of the stuff panned out of</text>
  <text start="95.34" dur="4.38">course we&amp;#39;ve demonstrated that the the</text>
  <text start="97.049" dur="4.5">chat logs were not evidence at all but</text>
  <text start="99.72" dur="2.64">he still stands by that still spreads</text>
  <text start="101.549" dur="5.311">that narrative</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="8.43">he drew oann into it as well when they</text>
  <text start="106.86" dur="7.38">aired this big anti queue so robotic but</text>
  <text start="110.79" dur="4.5">anti queue debunk that he did and at the</text>
  <text start="114.24" dur="3.479">end of the day it wasn&amp;#39;t really that</text>
  <text start="115.29" dur="5.55">convincing and this is the kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="117.719" dur="4.86">that he does so it&amp;#39;s not about when he</text>
  <text start="120.84" dur="3.5">doxxed me i don&amp;#39;t particularly care too</text>
  <text start="122.579" dur="3.9">much he&amp;#39;s not the first person to do it</text>
  <text start="124.34" dur="3.669">but it&amp;#39;s about that he can be</text>
  <text start="126.479" dur="3.541">demonstrated to be a liar in his own</text>
  <text start="128.009" dur="3.641">words like when he denied that he docks</text>
  <text start="130.02" dur="4.24">his people and then</text>
  <text start="131.65" dur="5.009">a week or two later he docks me and then</text>
  <text start="134.26" dur="4.47">a little bit after that someone that was</text>
  <text start="136.659" dur="4.14">a mutual viewer asked if he docks people</text>
  <text start="138.73" dur="6.69">and he he denied that he ever docks</text>
  <text start="140.799" dur="6.39">anyone so it&amp;#39;s that kind of it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="145.42" dur="3.269">kind of thing and not even to get into</text>
  <text start="147.189" dur="5.52">the censorship at the American priority</text>
  <text start="148.689" dur="5.761">conference which you know that post that</text>
  <text start="152.709" dur="3.48">they came out with saying basically we</text>
  <text start="154.45" dur="4.379">just consulted with some of our</text>
  <text start="156.189" dur="3.961">volunteers and Jack the sobic and now</text>
  <text start="158.829" dur="3.47">suddenly we&amp;#39;re not gonna have the hue</text>
  <text start="160.15" dur="5.52">panel that we were gonna have before so</text>
  <text start="162.299" dur="5.351">you know he&amp;#39;s intimidated by queue he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="4.679">actively working against the the</text>
  <text start="167.65" dur="6.02">dissemination of truth through the same</text>
  <text start="170.349" dur="7.17">kind of tricks that the left does</text>
  <text start="173.67" dur="7.209">censorship attack personal attack rather</text>
  <text start="177.519" dur="5.701">than attacking the argument which is all</text>
  <text start="180.879" dur="4.351">the daxing really was it was his</text>
  <text start="183.22" dur="4.68">response to some of my requests to</text>
  <text start="185.23" dur="4.319">debate him up until that point it was</text>
  <text start="187.9" dur="3.78">still you know I was still pretty polite</text>
  <text start="189.549" dur="3.541">with him even though I was calling him</text>
  <text start="191.68" dur="3.779">out for different things he was saying</text>
  <text start="193.09" dur="7.019">about queue</text>
  <text start="195.459" dur="6.03">and I think that&amp;#39;s the big chunk of it I</text>
  <text start="200.109" dur="3.391">mean if you go look at the fake Magor</text>
  <text start="201.489" dur="6.89">page there&amp;#39;s a lot more about his his</text>
  <text start="203.5" dur="7.409">military background you know information</text>
  <text start="208.379" dur="4.29">domination warfare specialists or</text>
  <text start="210.909" dur="6.091">something like that</text>
  <text start="212.669" dur="7.9">propaganda expert you know and once</text>
  <text start="217" dur="5.25">again in the Alex Jones circle there it</text>
  <text start="220.569" dur="3.66">just seems that everyone connected to</text>
  <text start="222.25" dur="4.44">that man just turns up dirty in some way</text>
  <text start="224.229" dur="6.031">eventually there&amp;#39;s so many different</text>
  <text start="226.69" dur="6.53">examples now including Corsi and and</text>
  <text start="230.26" dur="6.479">Zakaria on his his Zak you know</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="4.989">including certain of it I have my doubts</text>
  <text start="236.739" dur="2.911">about certain of it now as well for</text>
  <text start="238.209" dur="6.301">similar reasons to what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="239.65" dur="7.049">here with the sobic it&amp;#39;s just I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="244.51" dur="3.99">want to I don&amp;#39;t like to engage in the</text>
  <text start="246.699" dur="3.03">negativity side of this but at the same</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="4.319">point people need to understand the</text>
  <text start="249.729" dur="4.65">examples as we go on of the fake Magnum</text>
  <text start="252.819" dur="3">moves how they&amp;#39;re working behind the</text>
  <text start="254.379" dur="4.051">scenes so that you&amp;#39;re aware of this and</text>
  <text start="255.819" dur="4.801">you&amp;#39;re aware not only that it goes on</text>
  <text start="258.43" dur="4.2">but you can counter it that you can</text>
  <text start="260.62" dur="3.33">protect your mind from it you know this</text>
  <text start="262.63" dur="2.49">is the kind of thing that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="263.95" dur="2.85">they&amp;#39;re doing there</text>
  <text start="265.12" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s a Sion they&amp;#39;re actually getting</text>
  <text start="266.8" dur="7.17">into our team saying the right things</text>
  <text start="269.2" dur="6.03">and then spreading doubt and we take it</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="2.85">to heart because they&amp;#39;re supposed to be</text>
  <text start="275.23" dur="4.07">on our team right</text>
  <text start="276.82" dur="5.069">and that is a very effective</text>
  <text start="279.3" dur="6.25">demoralization tactic at the end of the</text>
  <text start="281.889" dur="5.28">day and this is a very complicated war</text>
  <text start="285.55" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re fighting with some very powerful</text>
  <text start="287.169" dur="7.531">and very intelligent and well resourced</text>
  <text start="291.4" dur="4.71">people so the bad guys are certainly</text>
  <text start="294.7" dur="4.11">doing this kind of thing there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.11" dur="4.05">certainly these patterns that go on with</text>
  <text start="298.81" dur="2.85">some of these fake magaz that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="300.16" dur="3.54">noticed as well and I&amp;#39;ve showed in the</text>
  <text start="301.66" dur="3.6">past some other videos where I break</text>
  <text start="303.7" dur="3.18">down some of the tricks that they use in</text>
  <text start="305.26" dur="4.89">real time even that you guys have seen</text>
  <text start="306.88" dur="6.27">some of the angry angry people they get</text>
  <text start="310.15" dur="5.34">so mad at me when I&amp;#39;m so polite and just</text>
  <text start="313.15" dur="3.6">I just ask the right questions I I point</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="3.78">out some of the logical fallacies and</text>
  <text start="316.75" dur="4.889">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a good kind of a good</text>
  <text start="319.27" dur="4.23">laugh and a good little drama I guess if</text>
  <text start="321.639" dur="3.661">you want to go back and see that but it</text>
  <text start="323.5" dur="3.12">teaches that the methodology is some of</text>
  <text start="325.3" dur="3.869">the tricks that they use to insert</text>
  <text start="326.62" dur="6.63">themselves into the movement you know</text>
  <text start="329.169" dur="6.031">I&amp;#39;ve caught them championing the the</text>
  <text start="333.25" dur="4.229">missing youtuber Bill Smith if I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="335.2" dur="6.81">actually caught people using that cause</text>
  <text start="337.479" dur="6.571">to champion to build up social influence</text>
  <text start="342.01" dur="5.46">and and followers and things like that</text>
  <text start="344.05" dur="5.7">on Twitter and then use that to to to</text>
  <text start="347.47" dur="6.24">cast really in my opinion blatant</text>
  <text start="349.75" dur="6.87">attacks from an emotional nature on cue</text>
  <text start="353.71" dur="5.34">and Trump at the same time as you see on</text>
  <text start="356.62" dur="6.15">repeat a couple different ones and when</text>
  <text start="359.05" dur="7.53">pointed out on it inevitably they get</text>
  <text start="362.77" dur="5.369">almost violently insane gone so far as</text>
  <text start="366.58" dur="3.959">to have my channel flagged for a</text>
  <text start="368.139" dur="5.761">original video die that I did calling it</text>
  <text start="370.539" dur="4.951">a copyright infringement you know so</text>
  <text start="373.9" dur="2.97">things like that I actually eventually</text>
  <text start="375.49" dur="4.399">won that and the video was reinstated</text>
  <text start="376.87" dur="6.09">but it was down for like a month or so</text>
  <text start="379.889" dur="6.25">just different examples just off the top</text>
  <text start="382.96" dur="5.25">of my head the fake Magga section of my</text>
  <text start="386.139" dur="3.75">website you know I still want examples</text>
  <text start="388.21" dur="3.84">like this if you see anything let me</text>
  <text start="389.889" dur="4.171">know to fill that in but it&amp;#39;ll never be</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="4.08">completed there&amp;#39;s a lot of ammount there</text>
  <text start="394.06" dur="2.629">and you know there&amp;#39;s always people that</text>
  <text start="396.13" dur="2.869">will turn</text>
  <text start="396.689" dur="6">for money right if you&amp;#39;re thinking about</text>
  <text start="398.999" dur="6.03">it I&amp;#39;ve been wealthy I&amp;#39;ve been poor I</text>
  <text start="402.689" dur="4.65">was a self-made man for a long time had</text>
  <text start="405.029" dur="4.26">a bunch of real estate worked 18 hours</text>
  <text start="407.339" dur="3.96">of data to save up my money and that it</text>
  <text start="409.289" dur="4.26">really well would that combine that with</text>
  <text start="411.299" dur="5.94">bringing an investment capital for</text>
  <text start="413.549" dur="5.55">multifamily apartment complexes was set</text>
  <text start="417.239" dur="5">to retire and then I lost it all and I</text>
  <text start="419.099" dur="7.5">was I was like 26 27 I was set to retire</text>
  <text start="422.239" dur="7.51">and then I lost it all because my mentor</text>
  <text start="426.599" dur="5.94">my friend of many years half a decade</text>
  <text start="429.749" dur="5.04">even and my partner embezzled commingled</text>
  <text start="432.539" dur="4.59">funds everything disappeared and I lost</text>
  <text start="434.789" dur="4.8">interest in money for a long time I got</text>
  <text start="437.129" dur="5.94">much more spiritual and I realized that</text>
  <text start="439.589" dur="5.72">I&amp;#39;ve been in much more pleasant and</text>
  <text start="443.069" dur="5.041">happy situations where I was dirt poor</text>
  <text start="445.309" dur="4.78">versus that really busy lifestyle with</text>
  <text start="448.11" dur="3.419">all these different stresses and the</text>
  <text start="450.089" dur="4.47">things that you won&amp;#39;t come to own you</text>
  <text start="451.529" dur="5.82">eventually anyway I&amp;#39;m not quite a mental</text>
  <text start="454.559" dur="5.61">minimalist but I want to be so I hope</text>
  <text start="457.349" dur="4.89">you guys have enjoyed this just you know</text>
  <text start="460.169" dur="4.14">keeping people apprised of what we&amp;#39;re up</text>
  <text start="462.239" dur="5.19">against and some of the tactics tactics</text>
  <text start="464.309" dur="4.98">that they&amp;#39;re using obviously it is my</text>
  <text start="467.429" dur="5.06">position my belief I think that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="469.289" dur="5.37">right about this that Hugh has tasked us</text>
  <text start="472.489" dur="5.26">originally to destroy the fake Marga</text>
  <text start="474.659" dur="4.53">more recently to expose the the fake</text>
  <text start="477.749" dur="4.83">news and then more recently to expose</text>
  <text start="479.189" dur="5.73">the fake maca this is a term that has</text>
  <text start="482.579" dur="4.59">now risen to prominence simply since we</text>
  <text start="484.919" dur="4.381">first started kind of talking about this</text>
  <text start="487.169" dur="4.14">and and I and others have started to</text>
  <text start="489.3" dur="4.829">expose some of these shenanigans behind</text>
