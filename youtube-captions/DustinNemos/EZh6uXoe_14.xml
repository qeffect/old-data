  <text start="11.46" dur="4.86">this I didn&amp;#39;t want to have to like I</text>
  <text start="14.269" dur="3.221">always feel like I&amp;#39;m like begging you</text>

  <text start="17.49" dur="2.879">that really is just networking and</text>
  <text start="18.869" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s really what I&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="20.369" dur="3.33">anyway behind the scenes and that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="22.199" dur="2.971">of you know how the book happened and</text>
  <text start="23.699" dur="3.871">how a lot of these other big things are</text>

  <text start="29.189" dur="2.851">with the audience I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of luck</text>
  <text start="30.449" dur="3.931">in the past if I needed something I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="32.04" dur="4.199">kind of you know sometimes I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="34.38" dur="3.54">know what I need or I don&amp;#39;t know what I</text>
  <text start="36.239" dur="4.351">don&amp;#39;t know but I&amp;#39;ll ask and I&amp;#39;ll reach</text>
  <text start="37.92" dur="4.02">out and it sort of appears I&amp;#39;m hoping</text>
  <text start="40.59" dur="5.399">this is a case where I could do that</text>
  <text start="41.94" dur="5.79">again so I need this apex health</text>
  <text start="45.989" dur="2.64">business it&amp;#39;s sort of taken off it&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="47.73" dur="2.88">a little bit bigger than I can handle</text>
  <text start="48.629" dur="3.481">and I own obviously I just did this</text>
  <text start="50.61" dur="3">other video and I encourage you to watch</text>
  <text start="52.11" dur="5.339">that if you&amp;#39;re a customer there for sure</text>
  <text start="53.61" dur="6.21">or just curious but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s growing</text>
  <text start="57.449" dur="3.84">into a good sized business business now</text>
  <text start="59.82" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s more than just myself and my wife</text>
  <text start="61.289" dur="5.19">and handle obviously we just outsource</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="4.74">to a third party fulfillment center so</text>
  <text start="66.479" dur="2.82">that we can have them handle shipping</text>
  <text start="67.92" dur="6.15">and stuff we don&amp;#39;t get overwhelmed again</text>
  <text start="69.299" dur="9.21">and I guess on top of that even we have</text>
  <text start="74.07" dur="5.7">to do traditional marketing and let me</text>
  <text start="78.509" dur="5.011">be clear about traditional marketing I</text>
  <text start="79.77" dur="5.88">don&amp;#39;t know much about it so I&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="83.52" dur="4.98">been like a DIY business guy hmm</text>
  <text start="85.65" dur="4.35">small scale you know honest integrity</text>
  <text start="88.5" dur="2.759">and all that stuff then very small scope</text>
  <text start="90" dur="5.369">business I didn&amp;#39;t have to do a lot of</text>
  <text start="91.259" dur="6.451">marketing you know and in this case this</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="4.441">is getting into a point where I have my</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="4.019">own market I can talk about it on the</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="3.54">show but there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s probably a</text>
  <text start="101.729" dur="3.39">bunch of people out there that need c60</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re not getting it anyway how do I</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="3.96">reach them I don&amp;#39;t even know is there</text>

  <text start="111.75" dur="4.71">demographics out there that could reach</text>
  <text start="113.729" dur="5.161">that we could reach that that that might</text>
  <text start="116.46" dur="4.83">help I mean if I could figure out those</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="4.29">questions if I knew the marketing side</text>
  <text start="121.29" dur="5.67">of things and how to do this art and</text>
  <text start="123.18" dur="5.37">professional and slick I could probably</text>

  <text start="128.55" dur="3.72">network without bringing in any outside</text>

  <text start="323.09" dur="3.87">have a successful Network we can reach</text>
  <text start="325.16" dur="5.07">millions instead of hundreds of</text>
  <text start="326.96" dur="5.52">thousands we could take it to a whole</text>
  <text start="330.23" dur="4.5">new level kind of compete for market</text>

  <text start="344.39" dur="5.25">you know there&amp;#39;s just there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="347.57" dur="3.54">opportunity not to mention the fact that</text>
  <text start="349.64" dur="2.97">we could actually do other things</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="3.69">besides our just spreading the truth</text>
  <text start="352.61" dur="5.73">about things I mean we can actually we</text>
  <text start="354.8" dur="5.97">can actually engage in yeah of course</text>

  <text start="370.49" dur="4.05">making them successful we could do</text>
  <text start="371.84" dur="4.44">things like this it does not have to be</text>
  <text start="374.54" dur="3.54">a very expensive thing there are so many</text>
  <text start="376.28" dur="3.57">Patriots wanting to dedicate their</text>
  <text start="378.08" dur="6.27">talent and stuff but it still does take</text>
  <text start="379.85" dur="6.09">funding unfortunately so we need to fill</text>
  <text start="384.35" dur="3.9">a couple of things we have to check off</text>
  <text start="385.94" dur="4.59">a couple of boxes we have to build a</text>
