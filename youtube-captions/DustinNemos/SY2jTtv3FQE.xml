  <text start="62.78" dur="4.35">usual I actually got him on video I</text>
  <text start="64.879" dur="4.621">turned the camera on him for a while as</text>
  <text start="67.13" dur="4.92">polite obviously but you know they never</text>

  <text start="75.56" dur="5.22">it was a very fun day of course we had</text>
  <text start="79.19" dur="3.09">right-wing watch there as well they they</text>
  <text start="80.78" dur="4.259">interviewed a few of us they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="82.28" dur="4.199">for something to try to to say oh we got</text>
  <text start="85.039" dur="3.991">you right that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re looking for</text>
  <text start="86.479" dur="4.89">I bet you that none of the three people</text>
  <text start="89.03" dur="4.26">that I spoke to write much about me</text>
  <text start="91.369" dur="3.271">because I didn&amp;#39;t give them anything you</text>
  <text start="93.29" dur="3.84">know they&amp;#39;re looking for something they</text>
  <text start="94.64" dur="4.229">can link to violence mainly and what do</text>
  <text start="97.13" dur="3.27">I do I spend half the time talking to</text>
  <text start="98.869" dur="4.051">them about how this is a non-violent</text>
  <text start="100.4" dur="4.74">movement and there&amp;#39;s no leadership or q</text>
  <text start="102.92" dur="5.01">posts that call for violence it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="105.14" dur="4.619">they have anymore so kind of a probably</text>
  <text start="107.93" dur="5.04">a waste of time but it&amp;#39;s always funny to</text>
  <text start="109.759" dur="5.101">kind of mess with the the enemy team I</text>
  <text start="112.97" dur="5.219">guess the journalists on the other side</text>
  <text start="114.86" dur="6.899">now the rally itself was I would say a</text>
  <text start="118.189" dur="5.04">massive success the the point that I</text>
  <text start="121.759" dur="3.601">think most of the mainstream media are</text>
  <text start="123.229" dur="5.07">gonna take away from this was oh look</text>
  <text start="125.36" dur="4.5">how few people showed up but let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="128.299" dur="4.831">this into a little further context as</text>
  <text start="129.86" dur="5.159">usual with the mainstream media very few</text>
  <text start="133.13" dur="4.29">people showed up comparable to the ik</text>
  <text start="135.019" dur="4.951">you movement why is that is a small</text>
  <text start="137.42" dur="4.76">rally over a hundred people maybe 200</text>
  <text start="139.97" dur="6.18">but it wasn&amp;#39;t a huge rally by any means</text>
  <text start="142.18" dur="5.44">why is that here&amp;#39;s why there were just a</text>
  <text start="146.15" dur="3.3">few youtubers that talked about it and</text>
  <text start="147.62" dur="4.05">we only talked about it for a few weeks</text>
  <text start="149.45" dur="3.45">I know I could have done a better job</text>
  <text start="151.67" dur="3.75">and I know many of the others could have</text>
  <text start="152.9" dur="4.11">as well is the last minute thing you</text>
  <text start="155.42" dur="2.58">know is a very last minute thing and it</text>
  <text start="157.01" dur="2.91">was 9/11</text>
  <text start="158" dur="3.99">in DC it&amp;#39;s very expensive time to visit</text>
  <text start="159.92" dur="5.16">hotels are like 500 ollars a night right</text>
  <text start="161.99" dur="5.76">so if in fact and this was a warm-up</text>
  <text start="165.08" dur="5.55">because the girl who put this event on</text>
  <text start="167.75" dur="5.7">who&amp;#39;s amazing okay Alicia she actually</text>
  <text start="170.63" dur="4.74">did this for the first time right like</text>
  <text start="173.45" dur="3.93">she just met all the influencers in the</text>
  <text start="175.37" dur="4.17">last two months or so and then just pull</text>
  <text start="177.38" dur="4.98">directly out and that&amp;#39;s incredible so I</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="4.05">cannot wait to see round two and three</text>
  <text start="182.36" dur="2.79">and four she&amp;#39;s gonna keep doing these</text>
  <text start="183.59" dur="3.3">rallies and she&amp;#39;s learned and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="3.63">gotten a lot of the warm-ups now and and</text>
  <text start="186.89" dur="3.6">she&amp;#39;s gotten more advisors and people</text>
  <text start="188.78" dur="2.94">that have experienced with this so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.49" dur="3.09">gonna be a lot better we&amp;#39;ll have better</text>
  <text start="191.72" dur="3.54">you know build up to these things in the</text>
  <text start="193.58" dur="5.4">future and it&amp;#39;s gonna be a massive</text>
  <text start="195.26" dur="5.73">rallies but it&amp;#39;s not fair to judge a</text>
  <text start="198.98" dur="5.4">couple of weeks build-up from two or</text>
  <text start="200.99" dur="5.01">three youtubers largely for the Q</text>
  <text start="204.38" dur="3.18">movement like there&amp;#39;s hundreds of us</text>
  <text start="206" dur="3.54">right there&amp;#39;s hundreds of influencers</text>
  <text start="207.56" dur="4.35">out there but just in this room alone</text>
  <text start="209.54" dur="3.99">now I&amp;#39;ll uh I&amp;#39;ll try to include some</text>
  <text start="211.91" dur="3.75">pictures in this video for you guys to</text>
  <text start="213.53" dur="3.75">see some of the event but just in this</text>

  <text start="217.28" dur="6.54">some point and I&amp;#39;ll get copies of that</text>
  <text start="218.96" dur="7.1">as well but just in this room alone so</text>
  <text start="223.82" dur="4.53">to speak and I say room because we did a</text>
  <text start="226.06" dur="5.56">speaker&amp;#39;s dinner before the night before</text>
  <text start="228.35" dur="5.639">but in this crowd alone of just that the</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="6.3">influencers that showed up what did we</text>
  <text start="233.989" dur="7.351">have we actually have a one or two</text>
  <text start="237.92" dur="5.76">million people worth of influence there</text>
  <text start="241.34" dur="4.47">that they tell us about I mean if you</text>
  <text start="243.68" dur="3.93">added up our subscriber counts yeah and</text>
  <text start="245.81" dur="3.24">we know that our subscriber counts are</text>
  <text start="247.61" dur="3.74">drastically lower than they should be</text>
  <text start="249.05" dur="4.439">like five percent of what they should be</text>
  <text start="251.35" dur="4.24">some of the folks on there have had</text>
  <text start="253.489" dur="3.81">their you know educating liberals still</text>
  <text start="255.59" dur="4.92">and he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s her buddy of mine and his</text>

  <text start="264.71" dur="7.05">cases look I&amp;#39;m one of the most censored</text>
  <text start="267.68" dur="6.09">folks out there why is that I guess it</text>
  <text start="271.76" dur="5.4">has something to do with a combination</text>
  <text start="273.77" dur="5.13">of both the queue movement and the stop</text>
  <text start="277.16" dur="4.53">at burning thing because Google knows</text>
  <text start="278.9" dur="4.83">about me right like his act for Jesus is</text>
  <text start="281.69" dur="3.75">talking about bit burning on on Twitter</text>
  <text start="283.73" dur="3.15">that&amp;#39;s the Google whistleblower do you</text>
  <text start="285.44" dur="3.93">think they haven&amp;#39;t looked into it you</text>
  <text start="286.88" dur="4.59">haven&amp;#39;t looked into us and they own</text>
  <text start="289.37" dur="2.31">YouTube and I&amp;#39;ve always been in the deep</text>
  <text start="291.47" dur="2.819">end</text>

  <text start="300.77" dur="2.94">something now which we all know is</text>
  <text start="302.75" dur="3.75">ridiculous</text>

  <text start="308.57" dur="5.73">very very consistent then down to 50 and</text>
  <text start="311.81" dur="3.75">then the algorithm started to be</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="3.48">developed that was before they were</text>
  <text start="315.56" dur="3.75">popular before people knew what the</text>
  <text start="317.78" dur="3.15">boosting and shadow banning really was</text>

  <text start="492.86" dur="5.73">trafficking as heavily and that and the</text>
  <text start="495.86" dur="5.04">further that goes and the more they try</text>

  <text start="531.44" dur="4.43">guess that&amp;#39;s my point here is that we</text>
  <text start="533.66" dur="5.31">are winning and when that happens no</text>
  <text start="535.87" dur="5.29">mainstream media hack will be able to</text>
