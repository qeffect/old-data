  <text start="536.67" dur="4.89">hippie commune except that they tortured</text>
  <text start="538.56" dur="4.74">and killed animals and and rape children</text>
  <text start="541.56" dur="2.87">and took nude pictures of children and</text>
  <text start="543.3" dur="3.45">they were sort of centered around</text>
  <text start="544.43" dur="7.21">kidnapping buying trading for and</text>
