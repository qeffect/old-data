  <text start="30.779" dur="4.771">Trump might say we also have the</text>
  <text start="32.91" dur="4.829">Democrat House focus on POTUS equals</text>
  <text start="35.55" dur="4.829">insurance extension from Mueller to</text>
  <text start="37.739" dur="4.5">house so Mueller is trying to pass the</text>
  <text start="40.379" dur="3.121">ball here to the house to sort of now</text>
  <text start="42.239" dur="2.941">that they have the house and they can</text>
  <text start="43.5" dur="4.16">sort of claim that they&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="45.18" dur="6.09">doing all these investigations and such</text>
  <text start="47.66" dur="6.52">they don&amp;#39;t need Mueller as much and to</text>
  <text start="51.27" dur="4.98">some extent he served his purpose so</text>
  <text start="54.18" dur="3.84">maybe they&amp;#39;re gonna let that pass on to</text>
  <text start="56.25" dur="3.449">the house at some point soon III don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="58.02" dur="3.12">know they don&amp;#39;t really have anything</text>
  <text start="59.699" dur="4.43">Russian I mean if you actually look at</text>
  <text start="61.14" dur="6.15">any crimes that have been you know</text>
  <text start="64.129" dur="6.821">prosecuted or even brought up out of the</text>
  <text start="67.29" dur="5.579">entire the entirety of the non crimes</text>
  <text start="70.95" dur="3.81">that he&amp;#39;s investigating he all of them</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="3.211">are for made-up things or for stuff that</text>
  <text start="74.76" dur="4.289">he discovered that were completely</text>
  <text start="76.08" dur="5.25">unrelated and and predated Trump even</text>
  <text start="79.049" dur="4.171">running for office so you know you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="81.33" dur="3.78">got you know old tax problems and you</text>
  <text start="83.22" dur="3.63">got people that slipped up and said the</text>
  <text start="85.11" dur="4.92">wrong thing when they were being</text>
  <text start="86.85" dur="5.129">interrogated by these FBI tricksters so</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="4.589">you know the same ones who broke the law</text>
  <text start="91.979" dur="4.111">or covered things up like 35 separate</text>
  <text start="94.619" dur="4.221">times to cover for the Clintons you know</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="5.37">those FBI tricksters so it&amp;#39;s not exactly</text>
  <text start="98.84" dur="5.26">like there&amp;#39;s some big thing that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="4.53">broken open here it&amp;#39;s not even a crime</text>
  <text start="104.1" dur="3.6">to collude with Russia</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="4.11">whatever that means I mean that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="107.7" dur="4.02">sort of a big open to an interpretation</text>
  <text start="110.1" dur="3.69">like subjective thing I mean are you</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="3.39">saying that he&amp;#39;s doing business in</text>
  <text start="113.79" dur="3.17">Russia and therefore excluding are you</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="4.68">saying he&amp;#39;s like actively working under</text>
  <text start="116.96" dur="4.72">like a foreign government power and</text>
  <text start="119.79" dur="4.23">running for office here which even then</text>
  <text start="121.68" dur="4.95">I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s illegal but you</text>
  <text start="124.02" dur="4.439">know even then why would he do that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="2.5">obviously a self-made man he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="128.459" dur="2.921">have</text>
  <text start="129.13" dur="5.52">kind of like its again it&amp;#39;s a projection</text>
  <text start="131.38" dur="5.25">right like they got to power relying on</text>
  <text start="134.65" dur="3.42">others like selling us out that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="136.63" dur="3.93">they made all their millions of dollars</text>
  <text start="138.07" dur="4.08">running for you know within working for</text>
  <text start="140.56" dur="3.84">public office you know look at some of</text>
  <text start="142.15" dur="4.44">these fine Steen types these Pelosi</text>
  <text start="144.4" dur="4.47">types are the Clinton types you know</text>
  <text start="146.59" dur="4.71">public servants but Multi multi</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="5.37">millionaires if not billionaires now so</text>
  <text start="151.3" dur="5.13">there is that also and then of course</text>
  <text start="154.24" dur="3.84">when Trump comes in self-made man loses</text>
  <text start="156.43" dur="3.95">a quarter of his wealth according to</text>
  <text start="158.08" dur="4.95">Julian Assange which is an old number</text>
  <text start="160.38" dur="5.59">running for office but men just to win</text>
  <text start="163.03" dur="7.83">on his own power on his own merit on his</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="6.69">own wealth oh man so now suddenly it has</text>
  <text start="170.86" dur="5.1">to be Dudley Dudley sweet for them to</text>
  <text start="172.66" dur="5.43">accuse him of being someone stop it when</text>
  <text start="175.96" dur="3.84">you know you can basically hear someone</text>
  <text start="178.09" dur="4.11">else&amp;#39;s voice coming out from their</text>
  <text start="179.8" dur="4.59">mouths because they&amp;#39;re being worked so</text>
  <text start="182.2" dur="4.64">hard all the time by every special</text>
  <text start="184.39" dur="5.43">interest that has a hand in their pocket</text>
  <text start="186.84" dur="4.33">anyway you know and by the way Hillary</text>
  <text start="189.82" dur="2.37">Clinton I&amp;#39;ve heard that if you go to</text>
  <text start="191.17" dur="2.85">prison you&amp;#39;re not supposed to have</text>
  <text start="192.19" dur="3.39">anyone&amp;#39;s hands and he wants pockets or</text>
  <text start="194.02" dur="3.27">it means that you belong to them so</text>
  <text start="195.58" dur="3.93">maybe you should keep that in mind for</text>
  <text start="197.29" dur="4.2">Gitmo we also have the grand jury</text>
  <text start="199.51" dur="4.74">testimony underway in several states now</text>
  <text start="201.49" dur="6">I think this means that the bad guys in</text>
  <text start="204.25" dur="6.36">government these sealed indictments and</text>
  <text start="207.49" dur="5.19">then things like that this is to do with</text>
  <text start="210.61" dur="4.14">that this is going on at the state level</text>
  <text start="212.68" dur="5.85">some bad things coming out about some</text>
  <text start="214.75" dur="5.61">bad people and then he brings up attempt</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="4.02">to block and protect themselves will</text>
  <text start="220.36" dur="4.59">fail this is far beyond political</text>
  <text start="222.55" dur="5.49">corruption and Sedition so this may even</text>
  <text start="224.95" dur="5.4">go into treason in some of the child</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="4.08">trafficking and some of that such and</text>
  <text start="230.35" dur="3.66">then he brings up the law governing</text>
  <text start="232.12" dur="6.06">removal of a sitting congressman or</text>
  <text start="234.01" dur="6.57">woman or senator lights on so he is</text>
  <text start="238.18" dur="5.55">saying pay attention this is coming</text>
  <text start="240.58" dur="5.19">towards you lights on and you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.73" dur="5.04">also telling us what&amp;#39;s going down I mean</text>
  <text start="245.77" dur="5.49">they are actively trying to you know</text>
  <text start="248.77" dur="4.11">shift this to the house and and cover as</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="3.42">many bad guys within the house as</text>
  <text start="252.88" dur="4.349">possible into this guys if well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.68" dur="5.61">investigating you can&amp;#39;t arrest us you</text>
  <text start="257.229" dur="4.13">know and then they&amp;#39;re going to do what</text>
  <text start="260.29" dur="2.659">they can</text>
  <text start="261.359" dur="3.06">what damage they can with the Muller</text>
  <text start="262.949" dur="3.511">thing I mean now there&amp;#39;s a sort of a</text>
  <text start="264.419" dur="3.691">spat between them again about Neal ORS</text>
  <text start="266.46" dur="3.389">not satisfied with his written answers</text>
  <text start="268.11" dur="3.089">and Trump is saying go pound sand I</text>
  <text start="269.849" dur="3.12">don&amp;#39;t have to say anything to you and</text>
  <text start="271.199" dur="4.59">again I mean that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;ve gotten</text>
  <text start="272.969" dur="4.23">so far is they catch people in some sort</text>
  <text start="275.789" dur="3.511">of a word game and then claim that you</text>
  <text start="277.199" dur="4.201">lied it&amp;#39;s a complete procedural</text>
  <text start="279.3" dur="3.929">violation I mean they are allowed to lie</text>
  <text start="281.4" dur="4.169">to you it&amp;#39;s a complete immorality it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.229" dur="6.361">completely unfairness it&amp;#39;s not a real</text>
  <text start="285.569" dur="6.66">crime and in fact not that I encourage</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="4.289">lying to the FBI or anything but I see</text>
  <text start="292.229" dur="3.99">nothing immoral about lying to the FBI</text>
  <text start="293.879" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re completely evil and I would just</text>
  <text start="296.219" dur="3.48">not say anything to them at all period</text>
  <text start="297.599" dur="7.461">and then you have the right to do that</text>
  <text start="299.699" dur="9.451">as an American so in the one time I was</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="6.159">there&amp;#39;s a story there I&amp;#39;ll tell it</text>
  <text start="309.15" dur="4.68">briefly really briefly I posted once</text>
  <text start="311.219" dur="4.26">years ago I think I was like 17 on a</text>
  <text start="313.83" dur="3.959">Facebook group called millions against</text>
  <text start="315.479" dur="3.96">Monsanto and I didn&amp;#39;t say anything</text>
  <text start="317.789" dur="5.551">illegal or anything like that but they</text>
  <text start="319.439" dur="6.84">came out to my house with an FBI like</text>
  <text start="323.34" dur="5.52">psych person like like an analyst and</text>
  <text start="326.279" dur="4.89">then they came out with an SPI and a</text>
  <text start="328.86" dur="5.25">local sheriff and after I gave them 30</text>
  <text start="331.169" dur="5.34">minutes of basically like a sitting</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="4.38">lesson on what they&amp;#39;re doing is corrupt</text>
  <text start="336.509" dur="4.5">and and designed to censor free speech</text>
  <text start="338.49" dur="4.019">and intimidate people out of bringing</text>
  <text start="341.009" dur="3.27">the truth out about these legitimate</text>
  <text start="342.509" dur="3.87">issues of this evil companies and</text>
  <text start="344.279" dur="4.2">possibly the most evil company ever in</text>
  <text start="346.379" dur="3.63">the history of the world poisoning</text>
  <text start="348.479" dur="3.601">people and how they&amp;#39;re just sort of this</text>
  <text start="350.009" dur="3.69">you know this thug enforcement branch</text>
  <text start="352.08" dur="3.239">designed to intimidate people and they</text>
  <text start="353.699" dur="4.171">may not even know it</text>
  <text start="355.319" dur="4.171">then they realized I&amp;#39;m not a threat and</text>
  <text start="357.87" dur="4.32">I told the sheriff to get them the hell</text>
  <text start="359.49" dur="4.44">of my property in a nice way and I</text>
  <text start="362.19" dur="5.779">reminded him that his obligation was to</text>
  <text start="363.93" dur="7.26">do so so that was me at 17 anyway 2673</text>
  <text start="367.969" dur="7.361">we have democrat party con this goes</text>
  <text start="371.19" dur="5.67">back to the third eleven 318 okay so we</text>
  <text start="375.33" dur="3.209">have democrat party con and you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="3.239">raise money organically through party</text>
  <text start="378.539" dur="3.151">okay so this goes through how Planned</text>
  <text start="380.099" dur="3.12">Parenthood was basically cycling some of</text>
  <text start="381.69" dur="3.24">that money back that they were getting</text>
  <text start="383.219" dur="3.361">from the government to the Democrats and</text>
  <text start="384.93" dur="3.389">we the taxpayer or paying for the</text>
  <text start="386.58" dur="4.199">Democrats because they aren&amp;#39;t popular</text>
  <text start="388.319" dur="4.44">they steal they lie they cheat and they</text>
  <text start="390.779" dur="2.581">can they buy out the MSM so that they</text>
  <text start="392.759" dur="3.75">have this</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="5.279">popularity but it&amp;#39;s no different than</text>
  <text start="396.509" dur="3.69">buying extra fireworks but setting them</text>
  <text start="398.639" dur="5.191">off alone they&amp;#39;re not that popular</text>
  <text start="400.199" dur="5.641">really and this is very obvious between</text>
  <text start="403.83" dur="4.32">the differences and crowd sizes between</text>
  <text start="405.84" dur="5.37">their leaders and our leaders so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="408.15" dur="4.259">just Trump but I&amp;#39;m not just Hillary and</text>
  <text start="411.21" dur="2.97">this goes to Obama</text>
  <text start="412.409" dur="4.01">this goes to Bernie Sanders now as well</text>
  <text start="414.18" dur="5.88">he can barely feel anything up anymore</text>
  <text start="416.419" dur="4.78">Hillary and Obama certainly can&amp;#39;t Obama</text>
  <text start="420.06" dur="2.97">a little bit bigger than Hillary</text>
  <text start="421.199" dur="3.421">obviously but you know they always have</text>
  <text start="423.03" dur="4.409">that trick they do where they they take</text>
  <text start="424.62" dur="4.409">the picture of the crowd and they keep</text>
  <text start="427.439" dur="3.51">imposing it everywhere else so you can</text>
  <text start="429.029" dur="3.991">see the same person&amp;#39;s head like repeated</text>
  <text start="430.949" dur="5.9">like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s funny but the innocent</text>
  <text start="433.02" dur="6.75">has done that for Hillary in the 2016 so</text>
  <text start="436.849" dur="4.87">he has fake news control over those who</text>
  <text start="439.77" dur="6.389">do not think for themselves limits</text>
  <text start="441.719" dur="8.82">exposure of truth democrat party con and</text>
  <text start="446.159" dur="6.211">he has this status here from charlie</text>
  <text start="450.539" dur="3.09">kirk Planned Parenthood spent 30 million</text>
  <text start="452.37" dur="2.849">to help Democrats went back to the house</text>
  <text start="453.629" dur="3.54">yet we still give them five hundred</text>
  <text start="455.219" dur="4.081">million in taxpayer funding each year if</text>
  <text start="457.169" dur="4.411">they have that kind of cash and engage</text>
  <text start="459.3" dur="4.19">in that blatant partisan activity why am</text>
  <text start="461.58" dur="3.809">i forced to fund them with my money</text>
  <text start="463.49" dur="4.049">great question</text>
  <text start="465.389" dur="5.661">as always charlie you do good work</text>
  <text start="467.539" dur="6.49">anyway so this is it for for today</text>
  <text start="471.05" dur="4.839">that&amp;#39;s all the queue and he&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="474.029" dur="4.44">bringing it back to what&amp;#39;s going on now</text>
  <text start="475.889" dur="4.71">he&amp;#39;s bringing attention back to a lot of</text>
  <text start="478.469" dur="4.32">this corruption with Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="480.599" dur="3.69">which you know basically is the</text>
  <text start="482.789" dur="4.47">Democrats I mean they&amp;#39;re so embed</text>
  <text start="484.289" dur="4.261">together at this point so what do we do</text>
  <text start="487.259" dur="3.511">what&amp;#39;s next</text>
  <text start="488.55" dur="4.709">things are being brought to the state</text>
  <text start="490.77" dur="4.41">level which is I think a very smooth and</text>
  <text start="493.259" dur="4.801">good idea get to that of DC gets it away</text>
  <text start="495.18" dur="4.409">from some of the corruption at least</text>
  <text start="498.06" dur="3.21">you&amp;#39;ll have victories there on some</text>
  <text start="499.589" dur="4.471">levels in some states where it&amp;#39;s not as</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="6.53">corrupt and you&amp;#39;ll start to get the ball</text>
  <text start="504.06" dur="7.71">rolling and I like this idea a lot so</text>
  <text start="507.8" dur="5.679">you know I don&amp;#39;t know I kind of envision</text>
  <text start="511.77" dur="4.499">it like Friday the 13th like the</text>
  <text start="513.479" dur="5.911">historical Friday the 13th when the like</text>
  <text start="516.269" dur="5.161">what everybody thinks it&amp;#39;s like an</text>
  <text start="519.39" dur="3.839">unlucky day now but the history of why</text>
  <text start="521.43" dur="4.05">isn&amp;#39;t unlucky days because back in the</text>
  <text start="523.229" dur="2.671">day when the Knights Templar hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="525.48" dur="2.64">risen to</text>
  <text start="525.9" dur="4.89">such power and within the Catholic world</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="5.82">and the Pope saw them as a threat he put</text>
  <text start="530.79" dur="4.59">out this letter in this letter to all of</text>
  <text start="533.94" dur="3.69">his commanders all of his military</text>
  <text start="535.38" dur="3.93">assets throughout Europe and it was not</text>
  <text start="537.63" dur="4.95">to be open until a certain time on a</text>
  <text start="539.31" dur="5.25">certain day and Friday the 13th and then</text>
  <text start="542.58" dur="4.32">they butchered the Templar and their</text>
  <text start="544.56" dur="4.47">bets across Europe and almost wiped them</text>
  <text start="546.9" dur="4.98">out I guess they went into hiding after</text>
  <text start="549.03" dur="6.12">that if they survived at all and I</text>
  <text start="551.88" dur="6.75">suspect they did so of course you have</text>
  <text start="555.15" dur="6.15">this kind of you know bad omen or bad</text>
  <text start="558.63" dur="4.92">juju associations with that date now but</text>
  <text start="561.3" dur="3.69">I&amp;#39;ve kind of been thinking that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="563.55" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s gonna go for a while I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="564.99" dur="3.54">thinking well when things get to the</text>
  <text start="567.03" dur="3.99">point where they&amp;#39;re finally ready to do</text>
  <text start="568.53" dur="3.99">the arrests they&amp;#39;re going to send out</text>
  <text start="571.02" dur="3.81">orders that aren&amp;#39;t gonna be opened until</text>
  <text start="572.52" dur="5.64">a certain time a certain day and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="574.83" dur="5.34">gonna happen and it&amp;#39;s gonna happen real</text>
  <text start="578.16" dur="3.51">fast and I think that when it does</text>
  <text start="580.17" dur="3.3">happen we&amp;#39;re not gonna hear about it</text>
  <text start="581.67" dur="8.34">until they&amp;#39;re already safely and get mo</text>
  <text start="583.47" dur="10.74">/ dead and I think at that point is</text>
  <text start="590.01" dur="6">going to be a new paradigm people are</text>
  <text start="594.21" dur="3.54">going to be at that point the world is</text>
  <text start="596.01" dur="3.72">already gonna shifted a little bit more</text>
  <text start="597.75" dur="3.96">away from the dollar people are going to</text>
  <text start="599.73" dur="4.2">be very much uncertain very much afraid</text>
  <text start="601.71" dur="4.77">a lot more people are gonna be waking up</text>
  <text start="603.93" dur="5.76">a lot more violence in the streets a lot</text>
  <text start="606.48" dur="4.44">more just general ante if I hate that</text>
  <text start="609.69" dur="2.49">kind of thing I don&amp;#39;t know if this is</text>
  <text start="610.92" dur="3.78">gonna be the future but this is how I</text>
  <text start="612.18" dur="4.02">saw or sort of saw it playing out and</text>
  <text start="614.7" dur="3.06">then of course the the National Guard</text>
  <text start="616.2" dur="3.33">military have more than enough</text>
  <text start="617.76" dur="5.1">you know boots on the ground to squash</text>
  <text start="619.53" dur="6.6">and Aoife so there would be order there</text>
  <text start="622.86" dur="4.86">would be economic chaos and then I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="626.13" dur="3.57">know what happens because if we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="627.72" dur="3.15">fix the economy no no you know the</text>
  <text start="629.7" dur="3.36">biggest military in the world is</text>
  <text start="630.87" dur="4.44">actually a big liability just a scroll</text>
  <text start="633.06" dur="4.2">so it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much military</text>
  <text start="635.31" dur="4.95">power we have at that point you have to</text>
  <text start="637.26" dur="5.19">be ready for anything for a while</text>
  <text start="640.26" dur="4.23">eventually order restores itself and we</text>
  <text start="642.45" dur="3.51">can avoid having some government</text>
  <text start="644.49" dur="4.02">stealing from us you know we could</text>
  <text start="645.96" dur="5.01">rebuild quite quickly through voluntary</text>
  <text start="648.51" dur="3.78">interactions so that&amp;#39;s it for today I</text>
