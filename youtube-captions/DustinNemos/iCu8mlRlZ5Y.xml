  <text start="139.77" dur="5.88">figure out how to open up one particular</text>
  <text start="142.86" dur="6.12">subset of individuals one particular</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="6.03">niche into understanding or being aware</text>
  <text start="148.98" dur="4.319">of the other niches you know this is the</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="5.369">divide and conquer strategy is one that</text>
  <text start="153.299" dur="6.571">is employed by the powers that be if we</text>
  <text start="157.049" dur="5.011">want to call them that to keep us under</text>
  <text start="159.87" dur="4.02">their control when we&amp;#39;re divided we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="162.06" dur="3.72">more ignorant when we&amp;#39;re ignorant</text>
  <text start="163.89" dur="5.849">unaware and that&amp;#39;s how they can bring</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="6.09">forth their particular agendas so by</text>
  <text start="169.739" dur="4.081">connecting these communities these</text>
  <text start="171.87" dur="4.5">groups of people and getting them aware</text>
  <text start="173.82" dur="5.31">of each other&amp;#39;s communities aware of</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="4.38">what&amp;#39;s going on elsewhere getting people</text>
  <text start="179.13" dur="3.6">within the alternative health realm to</text>
  <text start="180.75" dur="3.63">understand say the encroachment of</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="3.509">government as Dustin was saying or maybe</text>
  <text start="184.38" dur="4.079">what&amp;#39;s going on with the defense</text>
  <text start="186.239" dur="3.871">contractors and the energy technologies</text>
  <text start="188.459" dur="4.351">over here that are hidden from us or</text>
  <text start="190.11" dur="4.74">what&amp;#39;s going on over here in the</text>
  <text start="192.81" dur="4.679">political spectrum what&amp;#39;s being exposed</text>
  <text start="194.85" dur="3.96">so we&amp;#39;re figuring out how to do all that</text>
  <text start="197.489" dur="4.911">bring people together into all these</text>
  <text start="198.81" dur="6.149">subjects and how to do it responsibly</text>
  <text start="202.4" dur="4.869">carefully of course everybody&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="204.959" dur="4.62">different parts of their pasts may be</text>
  <text start="207.269" dur="5.011">awakened more to certain subjects than</text>
  <text start="209.579" dur="5.611">others so I&amp;#39;m going to be very careful</text>
  <text start="212.28" dur="4.17">and tactful with how we do that but</text>
  <text start="215.19" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re gentle but that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re here</text>
  <text start="216.45" dur="6.33">but effective yeah well it&amp;#39;s great to be</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="4.59">here and it seems like we&amp;#39;ve gotten a</text>
  <text start="222.78" dur="4.86">really good response so far like no one</text>
  <text start="224.43" dur="4.62">has been really offended by you know my</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="2.879">booth over here which is really</text>
  <text start="229.05" dur="5.34">presenting the full picture on one piece</text>
  <text start="230.519" dur="6.601">of paper and like yeah I&amp;#39;m really here</text>
  <text start="234.39" dur="4.29">to sort of expose these people who you</text>
  <text start="237.12" dur="4.29">know their first red pill their first</text>
  <text start="238.68" dur="5.16">rabbit hole has been vaccine injury you</text>
  <text start="241.41" dur="5.79">know it&amp;#39;s a really traumatic way to be</text>
  <text start="243.84" dur="4.56">woken up unfortunately but you know I</text>
  <text start="247.2" dur="3.899">don&amp;#39;t think too many people come to this</text>
  <text start="248.4" dur="4.5">conference unless they&amp;#39;ve already had a</text>
  <text start="251.099" dur="3.301">vaccine injury happens as one of their</text>
  <text start="252.9" dur="3.39">children or something because I mean a</text>
  <text start="254.4" dur="3.869">lot of this stuff at this conference</text>
  <text start="256.29" dur="3.87">could be really great for prevention but</text>
  <text start="258.269" dur="3.21">you know people aren&amp;#39;t coming here when</text>
  <text start="260.16" dur="3.03">they get pregnant they don&amp;#39;t come talk</text>
  <text start="261.479" dur="3.301">to someone it&amp;#39;s not the first thing they</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="4.5">think of so unfortunately these people</text>
  <text start="264.78" dur="5.1">have been exposed to the world of truth</text>
  <text start="267.69" dur="6.66">in a really brutal way that has really</text>
  <text start="269.88" dur="6.81">like traumatized their family but in a</text>
  <text start="274.35" dur="4.77">way it has you know awoken them in a</text>
  <text start="276.69" dur="3.9">very in a very strong sense and I think</text>
  <text start="279.12" dur="2.94">that a lot of these people are sort of</text>
  <text start="280.59" dur="4.68">ready to understand the bigger picture</text>
  <text start="282.06" dur="5.579">ready to understand why the mainstream</text>
  <text start="285.27" dur="5.22">medical industry has sort of failed them</text>
  <text start="287.639" dur="6.301">and that&amp;#39;s what the bigger picture panel</text>
  <text start="290.49" dur="4.83">is gonna address so hopefully it will do</text>
  <text start="293.94" dur="2.699">a good job at that I know I&amp;#39;m here</text>
  <text start="295.32" dur="4.56">getting out a lot of my free this is</text>
  <text start="296.639" dur="6.271">sort of what I&amp;#39;ve designed as the most</text>
  <text start="299.88" dur="6.12">potent red filling device I could I</text>
  <text start="302.91" dur="4.35">could imagine creating so did you I just</text>
  <text start="306" dur="3.78">want to say something about this how</text>
  <text start="307.26" dur="4.379">potent it is so the combat Comedy</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="3.84">Central actually featured this in a skit</text>
  <text start="311.639" dur="2.701">they did once and it wasn&amp;#39;t featuring it</text>
  <text start="313.62" dur="2.94">in a good way</text>
  <text start="314.34" dur="4.049">it was featuring it to discredit it but</text>
  <text start="316.56" dur="5.85">when comedy central feature of this this</text>
  <text start="318.389" dur="6.181">is about a year ago or so I looked at</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="3.84">the screen shot that Comedy Central</text>
  <text start="324.57" dur="4.05">shared from this and what they actually</text>
  <text start="326.25" dur="4.139">did was edited the words in it so for</text>
  <text start="328.62" dur="4.41">instance there&amp;#39;s the word secret space</text>
  <text start="330.389" dur="5.611">program on here that&amp;#39;s a fun topic to</text>
  <text start="333.03" dur="4.83">research they edited to say space secret</text>
  <text start="336" dur="3.9">program they took out the space it just</text>
  <text start="337.86" dur="2.51">said secret program secret secret wrote</text>
  <text start="339.9" dur="4.04">what secret</text>
  <text start="340.37" dur="6.6">program so this is to hard core this is</text>
  <text start="343.94" dur="5.009">to truth for them to show unedited on</text>
  <text start="346.97" dur="4.59">Comedy Central and they&amp;#39;ve also what</text>
  <text start="348.949" dur="4.5">reported on this in the wopo and wopo</text>
  <text start="351.56" dur="4.139">publish Washington like a tweet from a</text>
  <text start="353.449" dur="4.411">random person showing this but I mean it</text>
  <text start="355.699" dur="3.78">was kind of people read was it the New</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="2.76">York Times it it was either the</text>
  <text start="359.479" dur="2.791">Washington Post in the New York Times I</text>
  <text start="360.62" dur="3.09">saw that did feature this whole thing in</text>
  <text start="362.27" dur="4.05">their article yeah of course trying to</text>
  <text start="363.71" dur="6.48">make credit the whole blows my mind that</text>
  <text start="366.32" dur="6.06">they would show that but I was gonna add</text>
  <text start="370.19" dur="3.78">to that I know that you know when I put</text>
  <text start="372.38" dur="3.539">the book out as well kind of a red bull</text>
  <text start="373.97" dur="3.39">red pill device they they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="375.919" dur="3.511">these things at all getting out there in</text>
  <text start="377.36" dur="3.27">this map basically it looks a little</text>
  <text start="379.43" dur="2.79">confusing but the point is that</text>
  <text start="380.63" dur="2.9">everything is connected all this bad</text>
  <text start="382.22" dur="3.69">stuff going on in the world it really</text>
  <text start="383.53" dur="3.82">usually goes back to just a few people</text>
  <text start="385.91" dur="2.61">that have too much power and they you</text>
  <text start="387.35" dur="2.76">know they got clear up to they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="388.52" dur="3.69">pay attention you know that happens</text>
  <text start="390.11" dur="4.65">every so often people you know watch too</text>
  <text start="392.21" dur="3.69">much TV so we&amp;#39;ve got some bad folks</text>
  <text start="394.76" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;re hurting a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="395.9" dur="5.31">there we got to sort of wake up this</text>
  <text start="397.49" dur="5.73">army of honesty thousands and thousands</text>
  <text start="401.21" dur="3.9">if not hundreds of thousands of Tiger</text>
  <text start="403.22" dur="3.78">moms with hurt babies there they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="405.11" dur="4.14">know it yet but big pharma is behind</text>
  <text start="407" dur="4.62">that and a lot of that was I would say</text>
  <text start="409.25" dur="3.169">intentional but that&amp;#39;s just my position</text>
  <text start="411.62" dur="3.349">but</text>
  <text start="412.419" dur="3.9">we could we could definitely bring them</text>
  <text start="414.969" dur="4.5">around to some of the stuff that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="416.319" dur="6">on some of the why some of the how not</text>
  <text start="419.469" dur="5.401">just this autism issue but the greater</text>
  <text start="422.319" dur="3.931">picture I mean the CDC the the big</text>
  <text start="424.87" dur="3">pharma I mean they know about the</text>
  <text start="426.25" dur="3.24">revolving door to some degree but it</text>
  <text start="427.87" dur="3.03">goes beyond that it goes into so many</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="3.81">other issues that sell out of our</text>
  <text start="430.9" dur="4.44">culture of our country of our borders of</text>
  <text start="433.3" dur="3.66">everything else so you know wherever you</text>
  <text start="435.34" dur="4.47">see on politics it&amp;#39;s a free speech issue</text>
  <text start="436.96" dur="5.07">and we at least can stand by them on</text>
  <text start="439.81" dur="4.259">that and if we could tie this in and</text>
  <text start="442.03" dur="3.99">show those Tiger moms the real enemy and</text>
  <text start="444.069" dur="4.021">you have an army of volunteers that will</text>
  <text start="446.02" dur="4.679">never give up and never surrender no</text>
  <text start="448.09" dur="4.829">matter what so that&amp;#39;s kind of the goal I</text>
  <text start="450.699" dur="3.81">hope that we can pull off you know</text>
  <text start="452.919" dur="3.72">hopefully you guys have some more ideas</text>
  <text start="454.509" dur="3.361">than I do but you know I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.639" dur="3.53">gonna at least present the information</text>
  <text start="457.87" dur="4.769">present the arguments like people</text>
  <text start="460.169" dur="3.52">breadcrumbed them and they can read pill</text>
  <text start="462.639" dur="2.43">they can go a little further down the</text>
  <text start="463.689" dur="8.611">rabbit bowl if they want do you just say</text>

  <text start="477.729" dur="7.081">like half sheet Bowl you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="483.039" dur="3.24">think we need to do anything different I</text>
  <text start="484.81" dur="2.969">think exactly what we&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="486.279" dur="2.79">we just need to keep doing this is why</text>
  <text start="487.779" dur="2.431">they&amp;#39;re censoring us so heavily is</text>
  <text start="489.069" dur="3.78">because we&amp;#39;re being pretty darn</text>
  <text start="490.21" dur="9.06">effective with our true sharing on the</text>
  <text start="492.849" dur="7.68">internet this panel that we&amp;#39;re about to</text>
  <text start="499.27" dur="5.25">do I think we&amp;#39;re each going to talk</text>
  <text start="500.529" dur="5.371">about part of the big picture and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="504.52" dur="4.56">been told I&amp;#39;m gonna go first so I&amp;#39;ll</text>

  <text start="511.18" dur="5.969">gonna cover in that panel which is I was</text>
  <text start="514.57" dur="4.589">sort of tasked to cover the depopulation</text>
  <text start="517.149" dur="3.751">agenda which we&amp;#39;re gonna be careful with</text>
  <text start="519.159" dur="4.111">that terminology</text>
  <text start="520.9" dur="4.65">but as a lot of people have seen the</text>
  <text start="523.27" dur="3.81">cubeb before no like there is the light</text>
  <text start="525.55" dur="3.93">green section which is labeled G</text>
  <text start="527.08" dur="5.46">population a nicer term for that would</text>
  <text start="529.48" dur="5.37">be population control it has also been</text>
  <text start="532.54" dur="4.11">called family planning can we try to</text>
  <text start="534.85" dur="7.92">make up some more hardcore terms for</text>
  <text start="536.65" dur="7.439">that well extermination yeah and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.77" dur="2.64">also sometimes even just called like</text>
  <text start="544.089" dur="4.021">women&amp;#39;s rights like they really</text>
  <text start="545.41" dur="3.869">sugarcoat it down and like make it sound</text>
  <text start="548.11" dur="3.81">like something that&amp;#39;s very nice and</text>
  <text start="549.279" dur="4.951">friendly when you know women&amp;#39;s rights</text>
  <text start="551.92" dur="4.08">involved like giving them vaccine maybe</text>
  <text start="554.23" dur="3.26">for their child but then you know what</text>
  <text start="556" dur="4.23">do they put in the vaccine they put in</text>
  <text start="557.49" dur="6.76">HIV if you&amp;#39;re not we need to feed the</text>
  <text start="560.23" dur="6.66">world the GMOs right yeah so I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="564.25" dur="4.32">go into that a little bit in a in a</text>
  <text start="566.89" dur="3.51">gentle way and then go into a little bit</text>
  <text start="568.57" dur="4.38">of the history of Western medicine which</text>
  <text start="570.4" dur="5.939">from what I found seems like it actually</text>
  <text start="572.95" dur="4.77">came out of a military operation you</text>
  <text start="576.339" dur="2.791">know we all know from a secret space</text>
  <text start="577.72" dur="3.24">program that like the most advanced</text>
  <text start="579.13" dur="3.54">technology all comes out of the military</text>
  <text start="580.96" dur="4.26">and what most people don&amp;#39;t realize is</text>
  <text start="582.67" dur="4.14">that the most advanced medicine in a way</text>
  <text start="585.22" dur="4.35">also comes out of the military and that</text>
  <text start="586.81" dur="4.89">some of these Health Organization&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="589.57" dur="4.23">America that we think our civilian are</text>
  <text start="591.7" dur="4.23">actually controlled by the military like</text>
  <text start="593.8" dur="5.46">I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure the structure I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="595.93" dur="4.86">looked it up but um you know I just it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599.26" dur="3.36">like I read it before but like certain</text>
  <text start="600.79" dur="9.239">agencies are like direct control under</text>
  <text start="602.62" dur="8.79">the military I mean no medical agency is</text>
  <text start="610.029" dur="3.451">gonna do anything that the defense</text>
  <text start="611.41" dur="3.299">industry says might be a national</text>
  <text start="613.48" dur="5.97">security threat you know like maybe</text>
  <text start="614.709" dur="7.441">hearing cancer or national yeah at least</text>
  <text start="619.45" dur="5.31">in my research of the secret space</text>
  <text start="622.15" dur="4.32">program for energy realm yeah the</text>
  <text start="624.76" dur="3.48">military and the corporations do work</text>
  <text start="626.47" dur="3.54">together not saying the military in</text>
  <text start="628.24" dur="3.39">general you know but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s groups</text>
  <text start="630.01" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s rogue factions within the</text>

  <text start="633.79" dur="4.98">within the corporations and they keep</text>
  <text start="635.95" dur="4.62">them cell they work together so I like</text>
  <text start="638.77" dur="4.59">to call it like a quasi corporate</text>
  <text start="640.57" dur="5.34">governmental structure we have groups</text>
  <text start="643.36" dur="3.99">from rogue military world corporations</text>
  <text start="645.91" dur="3.57">they come together on their own I guess</text>
  <text start="647.35" dur="4.89">we could call it a secret society</text>
  <text start="649.48" dur="5.549">and it remains unacknowledged meaning</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="4.38">that this program doesn&amp;#39;t nobody talks</text>
  <text start="655.029" dur="3">about even the people within the program</text>
  <text start="656.62" dur="3.48">don&amp;#39;t talk about it to anybody that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="658.029" dur="3.841">not in the program so you could have</text>
  <text start="660.1" dur="4.979">people in Congress or even even the</text>
  <text start="661.87" dur="4.529">President himself or herself has no idea</text>
  <text start="665.079" dur="3.211">about these programs and doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="666.399" dur="4.321">access into them because they are</text>
  <text start="668.29" dur="4.59">outside us are basically a black program</text>
  <text start="670.72" dur="4.35">can happen in the defense contracting</text>
  <text start="672.88" dur="4.94">with the space technologies can happen</text>
  <text start="675.07" dur="6.09">with health technologies and whatnot</text>
  <text start="677.82" dur="7.48">pharmaceuticals so trillions missing</text>
  <text start="681.16" dur="6.33">dollars and where did that go we got any</text>
  <text start="685.3" dur="4.649">agreement between government contractors</text>
  <text start="687.49" dur="4.92">are people getting government grants I</text>
  <text start="689.949" dur="4.111">think some of that is public that any of</text>
  <text start="692.41" dur="3.299">it has the potential to be privatized</text>
  <text start="694.06" dur="3.3">and I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a lot of meetings</text>
  <text start="695.709" dur="4.291">and discussions that go on between like</text>
  <text start="697.36" dur="4.74">the CDC FDA and private industry that</text>
  <text start="700" dur="3.449">are completely you know it&amp;#39;s not a black</text>
  <text start="702.1" dur="3.239">project there&amp;#39;s completely off the</text>
  <text start="703.449" dur="3.781">public record I know that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="705.339" dur="3.36">recently changed it so that you know</text>
  <text start="707.23" dur="4.26">basically if they call it a national</text>
  <text start="708.699" dur="5.25">security reason even private companies</text>
  <text start="711.49" dur="4.32">no longer have to even report their</text>
  <text start="713.949" dur="4.5">numbers I mean this is all beyond the</text>
  <text start="715.81" dur="3.839">audit beyond the books like you just get</text>
  <text start="718.449" dur="2.76">to do what you want make up the numbers</text>
  <text start="719.649" dur="3.841">now because it&amp;#39;s too important of a</text>
  <text start="721.209" dur="3.391">number of sue it&amp;#39;s too obvious to show</text>
  <text start="723.49" dur="3.27">what&amp;#39;s really going on and they</text>
  <text start="724.6" dur="3.239">purposely keep a lot of the research and</text>
  <text start="726.76" dur="3.24">a lot of the numbers within the</text>
  <text start="727.839" dur="3.87">corporations because government is</text>
  <text start="730" dur="2.73">subject to FOIA requests Freedom of</text>
  <text start="731.709" dur="5.13">Information Act</text>
  <text start="732.73" dur="5.49">now the government can redact stuff from</text>
  <text start="736.839" dur="2.401">FOIA requests you can file a FOIA</text>
  <text start="738.22" dur="2.94">request doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="739.24" dur="5.19">all the info you want or your question</text>
  <text start="741.16" dur="5.76">answered but corporations aren&amp;#39;t subject</text>
  <text start="744.43" dur="4.38">to FOIA requests so there&amp;#39;s been bits</text>
  <text start="746.92" dur="3.93">and pieces of information leaking out</text>
  <text start="748.81" dur="5.07">from government databases because of</text>
  <text start="750.85" dur="5.31">FOIA for a long time and they want to</text>
  <text start="753.88" dur="3.6">stop that so they&amp;#39;re giving the</text>
  <text start="756.16" dur="2.88">corporation&amp;#39;s a lot more power and</text>
  <text start="757.48" dur="4.02">influence I was just talking earlier</text>
  <text start="759.04" dur="4.83">with an individual who was talking about</text>
  <text start="761.5" dur="4.56">FOIA and corporations and government she</text>
  <text start="763.87" dur="3.99">was saying that there&amp;#39;s pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="766.06" dur="5.7">companies out there who take in taxpayer</text>
  <text start="767.86" dur="7.06">dollars and research pharmaceuticals</text>
  <text start="771.76" dur="6.31">with that and ask for FOIA</text>
  <text start="774.92" dur="4.919">and some loophole laws or whatever they</text>
  <text start="778.07" dur="2.94">they have to admit I don&amp;#39;t they have to</text>
  <text start="779.839" dur="2.971">admit but we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="781.01" dur="4.35">taxpayer-funded but they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="782.81" dur="4.769">tell us what the results of their</text>
  <text start="785.36" dur="4.289">studies were so even the studies even</text>
  <text start="787.579" dur="4.2">the research not just telling us where</text>
  <text start="789.649" dur="4.651">the money goes or our program to have</text>
  <text start="791.779" dur="9">but research from it the publicly funded</text>
  <text start="794.3" dur="8.099">research they keep quiet one of the last</text>
  <text start="800.779" dur="3.541">points added on here that was sort of</text>
  <text start="802.399" dur="3.87">like the last minute edition was this</text>
  <text start="804.32" dur="3.6">right at the little upper right corner</text>
  <text start="806.269" dur="4.62">of the Big Pharma section which is</text>
  <text start="807.92" dur="4.59">rigged clinical trials which i think is</text>
  <text start="810.889" dur="4.2">a really important concept understand</text>
  <text start="812.51" dur="4.829">that just because you&amp;#39;ve seen results</text>
  <text start="815.089" dur="5.101">from a clinical trial doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="817.339" dur="5.971">it&amp;#39;s actually yeah true so easy to fudge</text>
  <text start="820.19" dur="4.889">a study I think maybe I would say most</text>
  <text start="823.31" dur="4.469">clinical trials are a large chunk of</text>
  <text start="825.079" dur="5.731">them are begun with the intent of</text>
  <text start="827.779" dur="4.771">finding a specific result and that the</text>
  <text start="830.81" dur="3.839">whole trial is engineered to find that</text>
  <text start="832.55" dur="3.63">result and if they don&amp;#39;t find it they</text>
  <text start="834.649" dur="4.591">start changing the rules of the trial</text>
  <text start="836.18" dur="4.71">mm-hmm exactly because you ain&amp;#39;t gonna</text>
  <text start="839.24" dur="3.81">get your money if you don&amp;#39;t get the</text>
  <text start="840.89" dur="4.05">result we want all right they don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="843.05" dur="5.099">funded if they don&amp;#39;t have the particular</text>
  <text start="844.94" dur="5.399">result Merc Merc itself was sued by two</text>
  <text start="848.149" dur="5.071">of its former virologist who form of</text>
  <text start="850.339" dur="5.481">Merck Workers for altering a study they</text>
  <text start="853.22" dur="5.82">did about I believe it was the MMR</text>
  <text start="855.82" dur="5.74">anyway they didn&amp;#39;t get the the</text>
  <text start="859.04" dur="7.049">virologist didn&amp;#39;t get this result that</text>
  <text start="861.56" dur="8.7">merck wanted so they went out and got</text>
  <text start="866.089" dur="6.631">some rabbit antibodies and put the</text>
  <text start="870.26" dur="4.35">rabbit antibodies in with the humans to</text>
  <text start="872.72" dur="3.63">mix it up and get the result they wanted</text>
  <text start="874.61" dur="4.37">so then they could bring that and say</text>
  <text start="876.35" dur="4.43">hey our vaccines work</text>
  <text start="878.98" dur="5.34">so it sounds like about as rigged as the</text>
  <text start="880.78" dur="5.76">second George Bush election well we know</text>
  <text start="884.32" dur="4.2">at least you know without you know going</text>
  <text start="886.54" dur="3.99">too much into politics side we know that</text>
  <text start="888.52" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s a corrupt system we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="890.53" dur="2.94">necessarily trust you know the people</text>
  <text start="892.45" dur="2.76">that are supposed to be taking care of</text>
  <text start="893.47" dur="4.05">our health and we keep getting sicker</text>
  <text start="895.21" dur="5.01">so Jordan man tell us about you were</text>
  <text start="897.52" dur="5.7">part of it and I&amp;#39;m very curious about it</text>
  <text start="900.22" dur="4.56">because you&amp;#39;ve got areas of expertise I</text>
  <text start="903.22" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t even go into the secret space</text>
  <text start="904.78" dur="4.65">program I can&amp;#39;t even find time to do</text>
  <text start="907.24" dur="4.2">that so I&amp;#39;m very interested to learn</text>
  <text start="909.43" dur="3.48">kind of your thoughts on on what</text>
  <text start="911.44" dur="6.86">strategies we can take in front of what</text>
  <text start="912.91" dur="7.83">areas you&amp;#39;re gonna cover but to win</text>
  <text start="918.3" dur="4.75">basically lines basically we have going</text>
  <text start="920.74" dur="3.42">on right now is a propaganda war and we</text>
  <text start="923.05" dur="2.97">have we have their black propaganda</text>
  <text start="924.16" dur="4.11">their fake news propaganda but we have</text>
  <text start="926.02" dur="3.9">to combat with our own propaganda not</text>
  <text start="928.27" dur="3.18">saying propaganda as a loaded word</text>
  <text start="929.92" dur="3.6">meaning you&amp;#39;re going to mind control</text>
  <text start="931.45" dur="3.57">somebody yet maybe we could call it</text>
  <text start="933.52" dur="3">white propaganda truth Floyd that</text>
  <text start="935.02" dur="3.3">propaganda there&amp;#39;s some you have white</text>
  <text start="936.52" dur="3.51">infinite some counter probably counter</text>
  <text start="938.32" dur="4.35">at truthful propaganda that&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="940.03" dur="6.62">that is true yeah so basically it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="942.67" dur="6.99">info war to use that term in its a</text>
  <text start="946.65" dur="4.78">proper terminology there that&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="949.66" dur="5.49">term that&amp;#39;s been it shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="951.43" dur="5.46">trademarked by yeah and and I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="955.15" dur="4.8">winning that&amp;#39;s the thing we&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="956.89" dur="4.38">censored up to a right now channels are</text>
  <text start="959.95" dur="3.24">being taken down people are getting</text>
  <text start="961.27" dur="4.41">suspended off these platforms because</text>
  <text start="963.19" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re winning The Washington Post is</text>
  <text start="965.68" dur="3.63">running articles like how are these</text>
  <text start="967.12" dur="4.2">anti-vaxxers so coordinated and so</text>
  <text start="969.31" dur="3.39">effective in both of us it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="971.32" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re winning is what to do it so I</text>
  <text start="972.7" dur="8.64">don&amp;#39;t think we necessarily need to</text>
  <text start="974.32" dur="11.1">change but I do think that what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="981.34" dur="8.88">helpful is things like this conferences</text>
  <text start="985.42" dur="6.18">events we can research to our hearts</text>
  <text start="990.22" dur="2.97">content with the Internet at our</text>
  <text start="991.6" dur="5.42">fingertips and with YouTube and whatnot</text>
  <text start="993.19" dur="6.75">but researching and learning through</text>
  <text start="997.02" dur="5.86">secondhand say reading or videos is a</text>
  <text start="999.94" dur="5.67">lot different than actually experiencing</text>
  <text start="1002.88" dur="6.569">having the experience of talking to</text>
  <text start="1005.61" dur="7.44">somebody where their child was harmed by</text>
  <text start="1009.449" dur="5.611">vaccine or be familiar with MMS chlorine</text>
  <text start="1013.05" dur="4.61">dioxide yeah I&amp;#39;ve been getting a lot of</text>
  <text start="1015.06" dur="6.87">crap in the media lately over my</text>
  <text start="1017.66" dur="6.37">discussion of MMS and I talked to a</text>
  <text start="1021.93" dur="3.749">woman earlier she&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1024.03" dur="3.24">taking MMS for the last three weeks I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1025.679" dur="4.471">like oh so it&amp;#39;s not a drinking bleach</text>
  <text start="1027.27" dur="6.689">like the media says so toxic drink</text>
  <text start="1030.15" dur="6.6">English so actually going and doing the</text>
  <text start="1033.959" dur="6.321">thing going to the conference or the</text>
  <text start="1036.75" dur="15.27">event or out to that ranch and actually</text>
  <text start="1040.28" dur="13.3">experiencing it is sort of our secret</text>
  <text start="1052.02" dur="3.269">weapon is like if the Washington Post is</text>
  <text start="1053.58" dur="3.329">wondering why it&amp;#39;s so effective you know</text>
  <text start="1055.289" dur="3.451">a secret weapon then we&amp;#39;re done trying</text>
  <text start="1056.909" dur="3.39">to make sure secret when things actually</text>
  <text start="1058.74" dur="3.03">make sense they tend to be more</text>
  <text start="1060.299" dur="10.081">effective than when you&amp;#39;re selling lies</text>
  <text start="1061.77" dur="10.139">on top of lies I agree this this is the</text>
  <text start="1070.38" dur="2.76">heart of it because this is where the</text>
  <text start="1071.909" dur="2.76">community is built they&amp;#39;re all the</text>
  <text start="1073.14" dur="3.87">suffering all the pain all that the</text>
  <text start="1074.669" dur="4.651">damage has been done it made this it</text>
  <text start="1077.01" dur="5.01">made this community it made this culture</text>
  <text start="1079.32" dur="4.229">and this doesn&amp;#39;t stop this doesn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="1082.02" dur="3.63">away and they have of course the truth</text>
  <text start="1083.549" dur="3.99">on their side but they have you know</text>
  <text start="1085.65" dur="3.779">like I said Tiger moms would hurt babies</text>
  <text start="1087.539" dur="4.441">they have passion that will never stop</text>
  <text start="1089.429" dur="4.531">they have a lifetime of passion to give</text>
  <text start="1091.98" dur="4.23">to a clause and really all they need is</text>
  <text start="1093.96" dur="4.14">a way to channel it I think I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="1096.21" dur="3.36">focus my part of this talk on on</text>
  <text start="1098.1" dur="2.64">solutions and things that we can do to</text>
  <text start="1099.57" dur="3.91">boost our efforts</text>
  <text start="1100.74" dur="4.06">mainly by networking just getting groups</text>
  <text start="1103.48" dur="3.09">together getting groups that are maybe</text>
  <text start="1104.8" dur="3.57">not talking together like you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1106.57" dur="5.16">in the old media we&amp;#39;re not necessarily</text>
  <text start="1108.37" dur="5.49">part of this anti-vaxxer or or whatever</text>
  <text start="1111.73" dur="5.31">community with the alternative health</text>
  <text start="1113.86" dur="4.68">community but we&amp;#39;re interested because</text>
  <text start="1117.04" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s a free speech issue it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1118.54" dur="4.14">human issue we&amp;#39;re all sort of on on this</text>
  <text start="1121.3" dur="3.45">together and then some of us have</text>
  <text start="1122.68" dur="4.05">children I mean wait we care about these</text>
  <text start="1124.75" dur="4.05">issues as well and maybe we have a voice</text>
  <text start="1126.73" dur="4.23">we could lend to it maybe maybe they</text>
  <text start="1128.8" dur="4.14">have some stories to tell or maybe they</text>
  <text start="1130.96" dur="4.25">need some reinforcement or something to</text>
  <text start="1132.94" dur="4.53">get some protection from some sort of</text>
  <text start="1135.21" dur="4.3">bully in the government trying to take</text>
  <text start="1137.47" dur="4.65">you know there&amp;#39;s one example I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1139.51" dur="4.05">working with safe James the website</text>
  <text start="1142.12" dur="4.53">there and they&amp;#39;re trying to take his kid</text>
  <text start="1143.56" dur="5.58">away the wife is trying to use the stuff</text>
  <text start="1146.65" dur="4.29">that the state&amp;#39;s power to take his child</text>
  <text start="1149.14" dur="3.24">away and then they have all of the</text>
  <text start="1150.94" dur="3.18">transgender everything else so they want</text>
  <text start="1152.38" dur="4.23">to turn a little boy into the world now</text>
  <text start="1154.12" dur="4.47">whatever you believe whatever you you</text>
  <text start="1156.61" dur="2.64">know I&amp;#39;m not going to even go into that</text>
  <text start="1158.59" dur="3.21">here</text>
  <text start="1159.25" dur="4.77">but this is using the state&amp;#39;s power to</text>
  <text start="1161.8" dur="4.29">do this by force and these kind of</text>
  <text start="1164.02" dur="3.87">things they need reinforcement sometimes</text>
  <text start="1166.09" dur="3.27">this this poor dad has been destroyed</text>
  <text start="1167.89" dur="3.21">there&amp;#39;s millions of other people out</text>

  <text start="1227.22" dur="4.11">add anything yeah I think this event is</text>
  <text start="1229.62" dur="6.18">like really great for sort of uniting</text>
  <text start="1231.33" dur="6.24">people because I I&amp;#39;m assuming autism can</text>
  <text start="1235.8" dur="4.02">be kind of like or dealing with autism</text>
  <text start="1237.57" dur="3.75">can be kind of like you know being the</text>
  <text start="1239.82" dur="3.15">truth or not having anyone to talk to</text>
  <text start="1241.32" dur="3.96">about it you know only having really</text>
  <text start="1242.97" dur="4.13">your doctor to give you advice and then</text>
  <text start="1245.28" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re giving you shitty advice</text>
  <text start="1247.1" dur="4.51">possibly not saying all doctors advice</text>
  <text start="1249.48" dur="4.62">is shitty but they were trained the</text>
  <text start="1251.61" dur="4.11">wrong way but yeah I think to come here</text>
  <text start="1254.1" dur="3.3">connect with other people or even to</text>
  <text start="1255.72" dur="4.23">like you know maybe form groups</text>
  <text start="1257.4" dur="4.92">separately like form the way like I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1259.95" dur="3.72">formed truth or groups like we still</text>
  <text start="1262.32" dur="3.99">call our truth or group so just writing</text>
  <text start="1263.67" dur="4.56">the illusion crew i&amp;#39;m jordiz big but</text>
  <text start="1266.31" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s basically like a truther group</text>
  <text start="1268.23" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;ve also call it like a tinfoil hat</text>
  <text start="1269.7" dur="5.16">group in Cincinnati but um you know if</text>
  <text start="1272.88" dur="3.33">if say look parents of autistic kids</text>
  <text start="1274.86" dur="3.12">could do something like that connect</text>
  <text start="1276.21" dur="3.57">with each other like find out from each</text>
  <text start="1277.98" dur="4.05">other like which of these remedies are</text>
  <text start="1279.78" dur="4.53">working which of them maybe have not</text>
  <text start="1282.03" dur="3.84">worked you know everyone responds</text>
  <text start="1284.31" dur="3.51">differently to different remedies but</text>
  <text start="1285.87" dur="4.17">generally I think some have been proven</text>
  <text start="1287.82" dur="4.8">to be actually effective and you know</text>
  <text start="1290.04" dur="5.58">ones that regular medical doctors aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1292.62" dur="4.53">really promoting so it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1295.62" dur="3.44">important for people to connect and get</text>
  <text start="1297.15" dur="4.11">the first-hand experience to really</text>
  <text start="1299.06" dur="3.93">understand the truth as opposed to just</text>
  <text start="1301.26" dur="3.93">reading it online because definitely</text>
  <text start="1302.99" dur="4.12">with every medical condition you can</text>
  <text start="1305.19" dur="3.27">read a ton of stuff online but you know</text>
  <text start="1307.11" dur="3.15">you don&amp;#39;t really know for sure until</text>
  <text start="1308.46" dur="3.3">you&amp;#39;ve heard someone&amp;#39;s experience or if</text>
  <text start="1310.26" dur="1.9">you try it yourself if it actually works</text>
  <text start="1311.76" dur="2.44">or not</text>
  <text start="1312.16" dur="4.32">and there is bad information out there</text>
  <text start="1314.2" dur="4.2">and you know I think this conference</text>
  <text start="1316.48" dur="3.93">kind of tries to avoid the term of like</text>
  <text start="1318.4" dur="3.81">curing autism even though I think for</text>
  <text start="1320.41" dur="3.9">some cases that has happened but you</text>
  <text start="1322.21" dur="4.83">know that&amp;#39;s no guarantee that for every</text>
  <text start="1324.31" dur="5.55">case like that remedy will cure the</text>
  <text start="1327.04" dur="4.23">whole condition but definitely from what</text>
  <text start="1329.86" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;ve heard at this convention so far is</text>
  <text start="1331.27" dur="4.23">that you know some people but with</text>
  <text start="1333.43" dur="3.39">certain protocols certain treatments</text>
  <text start="1335.5" dur="19.32">I&amp;#39;ve experienced almost complete</text>
  <text start="1336.82" dur="20.64">regression they did yeah I think I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1354.82" dur="4.29">heard a lot of speakers and people</text>
  <text start="1357.46" dur="3.87">involved with this conference have faced</text>
  <text start="1359.11" dur="5.09">like severe repercussions in their</text>
  <text start="1361.33" dur="5.7">careers and personal lives in terms of</text>
  <text start="1364.2" dur="4.18">being banned being censored some people</text>

  <text start="2090.56" dur="3.99">beyond like the past like 10 years</text>
  <text start="2092.23" dur="3.79">because like they&amp;#39;ve even since I was</text>
  <text start="2094.55" dur="3.3">born in like the mid eighties like I</text>
  <text start="2096.02" dur="3.66">guess I was should be grateful that I</text>
  <text start="2097.85" dur="3.9">probably only got a few vaccines that</text>
  <text start="2099.68" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;m gonna show I got some but if I had</text>
  <text start="2101.75" dur="3.3">been born five years later I might have</text>
  <text start="2103.25" dur="5.01">gotten like the whole boat yeah after</text>
  <text start="2105.05" dur="6.81">the pharmaceutical companies were no</text>
  <text start="2108.26" dur="6.24">longer held accountable they added to</text>
  <text start="2111.86" dur="6.63">the list so I got three vaccines my kid</text>
  <text start="2114.5" dur="6.09">got fifty eight I think a lot of people</text>
  <text start="2118.49" dur="4.05">who you know haven&amp;#39;t had a child in the</text>
  <text start="2120.59" dur="3.54">past ten years probably don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="2122.54" dur="3.24">realize like how much has actually</text>
  <text start="2124.13" dur="3.12">increased you know they say well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2125.78" dur="4.11">fine I got vaccinated but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2127.25" dur="4.23">realize that and in the span of their</text>
  <text start="2129.89" dur="3.81">lifetime the vaccines have increased</text>
  <text start="2131.48" dur="4.98">like tenfold and that it&amp;#39;s really just</text>
  <text start="2133.7" dur="5.46">like I mean I actually saw a video for</text>
  <text start="2136.46" dur="5.13">the first time just like last week of</text>
  <text start="2139.16" dur="4.29">you know like a baby lay down and just</text>
  <text start="2141.59" dur="3.45">getting like a row of shots in the leg</text>
  <text start="2143.45" dur="2.82">and it&amp;#39;s just like it&amp;#39;s really sickening</text>
  <text start="2145.04" dur="3.96">to wash you know it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="2146.27" dur="8.55">watching torturers well it is</text>
  <text start="2149" dur="7.56">I mean it&amp;#39;s child abuse my website all</text>
  <text start="2154.82" dur="3.09">my vaccine information and I just</text>
  <text start="2156.56" dur="3.81">compiled it because I like to debate</text>
  <text start="2157.91" dur="4.53">this topic off the top of my head he</text>
  <text start="2160.37" dur="3.69">mentioned Supreme Court case let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="2162.44" dur="3.15">through some of the myths of vaccines</text>
  <text start="2164.06" dur="2.61">that they try to push like doctors</text>
  <text start="2165.59" dur="3.09">you&amp;#39;re like well we got rid of polio</text>
  <text start="2166.67" dur="3.24">right well oh you didn&amp;#39;t get rid of</text>
  <text start="2168.68" dur="3.48">polio or any of these other diseases</text>
  <text start="2169.91" dur="3.57">they changed the name yeah they changed</text>
  <text start="2172.16" dur="3.15">the name to prevent you knowing that</text>
  <text start="2173.48" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s still there but actually that all</text>
  <text start="2175.31" dur="3.93">the grafts were doing this sort of</text>
  <text start="2176.84" dur="3.9">downward trends then they introduced the</text>
  <text start="2179.24" dur="3.36">vaccine that&amp;#39;s almost always what</text>
  <text start="2180.74" dur="3.66">happens it shoots back up mini states</text>
  <text start="2182.6" dur="3.3">actually ban the polio vaccine for</text>
  <text start="2184.4" dur="3.27">paralyzing and killing people in mass</text>
  <text start="2185.9" dur="4.5">and then it continues this downward</text>
  <text start="2187.67" dur="5.85">trend why is it that the vaccines were</text>
  <text start="2190.4" dur="4.68">late to the the save right well the real</text>
  <text start="2193.52" dur="3.12">reason is because we had plumbing me at</text>
  <text start="2195.08" dur="3.51">toilets we weren&amp;#39;t throwing our crap out</text>
  <text start="2196.64" dur="3.42">in the streets anymore in buckets but we</text>
  <text start="2198.59" dur="2.94">were walking in I mean we had modern</text>
  <text start="2200.06" dur="3.69">infrastructure modern plumbing</text>
  <text start="2201.53" dur="4.47">modern technology it helps all the time</text>
  <text start="2203.75" dur="3.81">once again modern technology was there</text>
  <text start="2206" dur="4.5">to the rescue and we became a better</text>
  <text start="2207.56" dur="4.74">healthier more effective you know sort</text>
  <text start="2210.5" dur="3.27">of the capitalist idea of just always</text>
  <text start="2212.3" dur="2.09">improving things and getting better and</text>
  <text start="2213.77" dur="3.02">better and better</text>
  <text start="2214.39" dur="5.22">win-win but you know that technology is</text>
  <text start="2216.79" dur="5.22">what saved us it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not vaccines</text>
  <text start="2219.61" dur="3.99">which you are is certainly a technology</text>
  <text start="2222.01" dur="3.51">but more of like a bio weapon if you</text>
  <text start="2223.6" dur="5.28">actually look into what&amp;#39;s the results</text>

  <text start="2327.85" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re getting vaccinated for like really</text>
  <text start="2329.26" dur="3.63">would really not be that serious you get</text>
  <text start="2331.66" dur="3.54">the first sign of something you could</text>
  <text start="2332.89" dur="4.02">just eradicate it with any one of these</text>

  <text start="2459.32" dur="3.63">doctors will discover this to change</text>
  <text start="2460.79" dur="4.26">your position but that&amp;#39;s happened many</text>
  <text start="2462.95" dur="3.57">doctors have I mean just going off of</text>
  <text start="2465.05" dur="3.39">some of the stuff that we already know</text>

  <text start="2480.56" dur="3.39">really all that bad he said we need more</text>
  <text start="2481.82" dur="3.96">research into this issue I mean we have</text>
  <text start="2483.95" dur="3.99">other cases where people have gone</text>
