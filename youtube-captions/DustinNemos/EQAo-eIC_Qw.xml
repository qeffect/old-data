  <text start="18.539" dur="6.441">our Twitter&amp;#39;s there was some kind of</text>
  <text start="22.65" dur="5.34">weird stuff in the beginning because</text>
  <text start="24.98" dur="5.77">Dustin has had his own experience with Q</text>

  <text start="33.21" dur="5.73">friendly Q debate and we are here to</text>
  <text start="35.45" dur="6.39">conversate like human beings and we have</text>
  <text start="38.94" dur="5.93">been doing so for the last hour or so</text>
  <text start="41.84" dur="5.77">I&amp;#39;ve gone through like three coffees and</text>
  <text start="44.87" dur="5.8">just to prepare for the event I went out</text>
  <text start="47.61" dur="7.949">and got a bookshelf so I could be on the</text>
  <text start="50.67" dur="7.56">same level so yeah what&amp;#39;s up Dustin hey</text>
  <text start="55.559" dur="4.711">man again I apologize about the lake</text>
  <text start="58.23" dur="4.68">virtual phone tag or whatever like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="60.27" dur="7.77">such a busy thing lately so I&amp;#39;m glad we</text>
  <text start="62.91" dur="8.639">got to do this yeah so mainly like how I</text>
  <text start="68.04" dur="6.6">first wanted to do this was I wanted to</text>
  <text start="71.549" dur="4.801">go in and talk about some of the big</text>
  <text start="74.64" dur="4.35">things that have been plaguing the Q</text>
  <text start="76.35" dur="4.92">movement I was an avid Q follower I</text>
  <text start="78.99" dur="5.129">still follow it I just I&amp;#39;ve had my</text>
  <text start="81.27" dur="4.65">doubts and I&amp;#39;ve even surveyed my viewers</text>
  <text start="84.119" dur="4.741">about half of them are still on the</text>
  <text start="85.92" dur="5.58">train still but the other half they you</text>
  <text start="88.86" dur="4.17">know they say I jumped off long ago so I</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="4.68">thought that it was important to get</text>
  <text start="93.03" dur="4.979">somebody that is respected in the Q</text>
  <text start="96.18" dur="5.07">field and ask some questions about it</text>
  <text start="98.009" dur="5.07">and whatsoever we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="4.259">some stuff</text>
  <text start="103.079" dur="5.101">so the big thing the NBC thing that you</text>
  <text start="105.509" dur="4.201">say is debunked what would it what is</text>
  <text start="108.18" dur="4.59">your opinion on that and the pamphlet</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="4.949">stuff that we were talking about so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="3.989">not like you say the NBC thing but it</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="4.261">it&amp;#39;s been around for a month now</text>
  <text start="116.759" dur="5.46">and it it seems to be like in my</text>
  <text start="118.92" dur="6.089">opinions a source is uni Rock and zero</text>
  <text start="122.219" dur="5.311">hour one and it may seem to have have</text>
  <text start="125.009" dur="4.11">perpetuated this thing just by you know</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="3.119">like the big life theory they just keep</text>
  <text start="129.119" dur="3.031">repeating it loudly and</text>
  <text start="130.649" dur="3.151">and they throw a lot of emotion into it</text>
  <text start="132.15" dur="3.57">and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what they do they just</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="3.78">kind of I don&amp;#39;t know 0 or 1 I never</text>
  <text start="135.72" dur="4.29">watch of stuff but but uni rocked is</text>
  <text start="137.58" dur="3.87">kinda they&amp;#39;ll throw a lot of emotion</text>
  <text start="140.01" dur="2.369">into it in that like your student but if</text>
  <text start="141.45" dur="2.34">you don&amp;#39;t agree with him and then move</text>
  <text start="142.379" dur="4.021">on never really has much of an argument</text>
  <text start="143.79" dur="4.199">except where he&amp;#39;ll play these these</text>
  <text start="146.4" dur="3.119">games where he takes advantage of his</text>
  <text start="147.989" dur="6.961">audience and how they don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="149.519" dur="6.931">the technological in the context so like</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="4.02">the technological more recently they</text>
  <text start="156.45" dur="5.25">came out with this like series of like</text>
  <text start="158.97" dur="4.5">emails and this time it&amp;#39;s like backlog</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="3.3">of a website that&amp;#39;s like the proof of</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="4.2">queue and stuff when really that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="165" dur="4.019">like I was a video gamer so I&amp;#39;ve seen a</text>
  <text start="167.67" dur="3.51">ton of these sites that was like the</text>
  <text start="169.019" dur="4.321">backend archive of basically what</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="3.6">equates to a fan site but a fan club it</text>
  <text start="173.34" dur="3.6">was one of the archive sites which</text>
  <text start="174.78" dur="3.63">people set up independently because</text>
  <text start="176.94" dur="2.939">they&amp;#39;re volunteering their time to do</text>
  <text start="178.41" dur="3.21">that for Q because he&amp;#39;s asked us to</text>
  <text start="179.879" dur="4.021">archive everything so you go to one of</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="4.41">these archive which is like the backend</text>
  <text start="183.9" dur="3.54">organizational part of it you see all</text>
  <text start="186.03" dur="2.489">the posts and all the files and then</text>
  <text start="187.44" dur="3.54">you&amp;#39;re like oh look we caught your</text>
  <text start="188.519" dur="4.921">secret what that&amp;#39;s really deceptive and</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="4.7">the other thing is that the pamphlet</text>
  <text start="193.44" dur="5.16">thing like pamphlet is hewn on like</text>
  <text start="195.68" dur="6.01">templates an OK guy but he&amp;#39;s not smart</text>
  <text start="198.6" dur="5.31">enough to be Q&amp;amp;R in a lot of times when</text>
  <text start="201.69" dur="3.81">he&amp;#39;s when he was literally posting I was</text>
  <text start="203.91" dur="5.49">on the show with him earlier I was</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="6.48">invited on 24/7 so Fox he was posting</text>
  <text start="209.4" dur="5.669">while we&amp;#39;re there pamphlet is not typing</text>
  <text start="211.98" dur="4.979">you know he&amp;#39;s not he&amp;#39;s talking to us and</text>
  <text start="215.069" dur="4.26">interpreting and going through some of</text>
  <text start="216.959" dur="6.451">the stuff was happening but this all</text>
  <text start="219.329" dur="5.821">came from this this really misconstrued</text>
  <text start="223.41" dur="3.57">event that you in rock didn&amp;#39;t like the</text>
  <text start="225.15" dur="4.38">big life thing with and this event was</text>
  <text start="226.98" dur="5.3">back when the second time in a minute</text>
  <text start="229.53" dur="5.459">and this is the context the second time</text>
  <text start="232.28" dur="3.549">that Hugh had posted his password for</text>
  <text start="234.989" dur="3.12">everyone to see</text>
  <text start="235.829" dur="3.511">so the first time was when he passed it</text>
  <text start="238.109" dur="4.801">I think it was to fight fight fight</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="5.28">after and then you saw like you know a</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="3.6">bunch of people logging in skew and</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="3.76">start saying stupid things or like you</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="4.42">what&amp;#39;s up you can&amp;#39;t or some people</text>
  <text start="248.38" dur="5.91">Ranvir are saying really stupid things</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="6.6">and it was there he saw that too so that</text>
  <text start="254.29" dur="5.94">the second time and this is the time the</text>
  <text start="257.53" dur="8.97">second time happening he recognized it</text>
  <text start="260.23" dur="7.92">for what it was and then you know I was</text>
  <text start="266.5" dur="3.81">watching this as it happened and I saw</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="3.6">these people log in his queue and start</text>
  <text start="270.31" dur="3.18">posting and stuff and then everyone</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="3.99">starts spreading this idea based on my</text>
  <text start="273.49" dur="5.13">guess uni rock was the best I can tell</text>
  <text start="275.74" dur="5.72">the source that that pamphlet is Q</text>
  <text start="278.62" dur="5.46">because we caught him you know you know</text>
  <text start="281.46" dur="3.94">logging in as Q or something like I</text>
  <text start="284.08" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t remember the exact details of it</text>
  <text start="285.4" dur="4.65">but at this point he kind of he just</text>
  <text start="288.61" dur="3.39">kept spreading this thing and really</text>
  <text start="290.05" dur="3.39">anyone who had seen the first time that</text>
  <text start="292" dur="3.87">he did this would recognize that that</text>
  <text start="293.44" dur="3.93">was a password Q dropped himself the</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="2.64">reason is every so often you have to</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="3.21">change because they&amp;#39;re just trying to</text>
  <text start="298.51" dur="3.69">brute-force hack into his account right</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="3.42">and then they did recently they actually</text>
  <text start="302.2" dur="3.36">got into his account recently and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304" dur="3.27">why he has the two exclamation points</text>
  <text start="305.56" dur="3.75">now because he just basically quadrupled</text>
  <text start="307.27" dur="4.14">his security which just kind of means</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="5.25">that he was leaving at low level for for</text>
  <text start="311.41" dur="6.21">for funsies you know why why go in with</text>
  <text start="314.56" dur="4.38">the lowest level security but I guess</text>
  <text start="317.62" dur="2.85">unless you&amp;#39;re trying to make people look</text>
  <text start="318.94" dur="3.87">stupid and call them out like this is a</text>
  <text start="320.47" dur="4.86">this actually set them up to look stupid</text>
  <text start="322.81" dur="3.87">in the context so you know we have</text>
  <text start="325.33" dur="3.18">people like Jack the sobic now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.68" dur="3.93">jumping off of that and using that as a</text>
  <text start="328.51" dur="4.23">pamphlet as Q we&amp;#39;ve debunked it all and</text>
  <text start="330.61" dur="8.7">they&amp;#39;re just setting themselves up to</text>
  <text start="332.74" dur="11.01">fail go ahead I can&amp;#39;t hear you I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="339.31" dur="7.08">hear you I had to fix the audio because</text>
  <text start="343.75" dur="4.98">it was picking up the computer speakers</text>
  <text start="346.39" dur="4.11">so I put my earphones in here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="348.73" dur="5.58">question for you though III don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="350.5" dur="6.21">understand so the fight the Iran fight</text>
  <text start="354.31" dur="4.14">fight fight the one that just so happens</text>
  <text start="356.71" dur="4.95">to be the one to that people were like</text>
  <text start="358.45" dur="5.45">what Q is pushing war in Iran is that</text>
  <text start="361.66" dur="4.92">the one you were you were referencing I</text>
  <text start="363.9" dur="5.02">don&amp;#39;t remember the Iran context I just</text>
  <text start="366.58" dur="3.6">remember the the password part where he</text>
  <text start="368.92" dur="2.91">dropped the password and then people</text>
  <text start="370.18" dur="3.51">logged in and then anyone that had seen</text>
  <text start="371.83" dur="4.56">that would recognize it again the second</text>
  <text start="373.69" dur="6.199">time but if you hadn&amp;#39;t seen that and you</text>
  <text start="376.39" dur="5.54">saw someone like logging in his Q or you</text>
  <text start="379.889" dur="3.391">whatever then you would think that this</text>
  <text start="381.93" dur="3.419">is Q and this is obvious proof or</text>
  <text start="383.28" dur="4.77">whatever and it&amp;#39;s not but but did it say</text>

  <text start="568.699" dur="4.26">I&amp;#39;ve ever seen him do basically was pull</text>
  <text start="570.709" dur="4.891">up these kind of things or or just</text>
  <text start="572.959" dur="4.35">insult or use that you know he&amp;#39;d loves</text>
  <text start="575.6" dur="4.32">to do the appeal to emotion where he&amp;#39;ll</text>

  <text start="582.8" dur="5.639">gets a lot of people that that is enough</text>
  <text start="585.11" dur="5.729">for some people and you know you say</text>
  <text start="588.439" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s back to the big live</text>
  <text start="590.839" dur="4.56">theory if you say it loudly enough and</text>
  <text start="593.329" dur="6.24">you keep repeating it people will some</text>
  <text start="595.399" dur="6.571">people will buy it another another</text>
  <text start="599.569" dur="5.401">question for you is what do you think</text>
  <text start="601.97" dur="6.539">about the trip codes matching relevant</text>
  <text start="604.97" dur="5.46">books as far as that goes it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="608.509" dur="3.721">interesting I&amp;#39;m a book lover but at the</text>
  <text start="610.43" dur="3.24">same point I don&amp;#39;t think it can be I</text>
  <text start="612.23" dur="2.459">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s verifying because I</text>
  <text start="613.67" dur="2.609">think there was something that recently</text>
  <text start="614.689" dur="4.171">came out like some of the recent ones</text>
  <text start="616.279" dur="4.29">didn&amp;#39;t it happened about the time he got</text>
  <text start="618.86" dur="3.99">hacked and then he had to change the</text>
  <text start="620.569" dur="4.2">trip code to the higher level double</text>
  <text start="622.85" dur="3.359">exclamation point thing so I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="624.769" dur="3.06">if this is something that we can confirm</text>
  <text start="626.209" dur="2.761">necessarily but it is interesting and</text>
  <text start="627.829" dur="4.591">every one of those books is worth</text>
  <text start="628.97" dur="4.859">reading so I think it&amp;#39;s fascinating it</text>
  <text start="632.42" dur="2.55">may just be people reaching out for</text>
  <text start="633.829" dur="3.3">something that&amp;#39;s not there though I mean</text>
  <text start="634.97" dur="3.419">we do that we we open every door and</text>
  <text start="637.129" dur="4.44">sometimes people walk through the wrong</text>
  <text start="638.389" dur="4.741">ones like the JFK thing yeah and that</text>
  <text start="641.569" dur="4.37">was another thing we just talked about</text>

  <text start="649.419" dur="7.051">thought the JFK thing was was put there</text>
  <text start="651.549" dur="6.21">to make Q people look stupid another</text>
  <text start="656.47" dur="4.829">thing that I wanted to talk to you about</text>

  <text start="666.429" dur="4.02">met and he came on the show and actually</text>
  <text start="668.589" dur="2.94">wants to do something about health next</text>

  <text start="671.529" dur="3.21">we&amp;#39;re gonna do like a health thing but</text>
  <text start="673.179" dur="3.39">what do you think about him</text>
  <text start="674.739" dur="3.81">his recent tweet and I did send you the</text>

  <text start="689.679" dur="3.39">so I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s a wise thing to</text>
  <text start="691.539" dur="3.51">do I don&amp;#39;t necessarily think it&amp;#39;s proof</text>
  <text start="693.069" dur="4.2">he&amp;#39;s a bad guy do you think it was a</text>

  <text start="703.119" dur="5.25">you know it&amp;#39;s probably probably not a</text>
  <text start="706.479" dur="3.96">wise thing to do you know I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="708.369" dur="3.93">maybe it&amp;#39;s well-intentioned but you know</text>

  <text start="871.78" dur="3.8">posts to try to debunk it you know and</text>
  <text start="874.3" dur="3.6">all you have to do is just verify that</text>
  <text start="875.58" dur="5.95">versus the archive of the queue posting</text>
  <text start="877.9" dur="6.09">you know he&amp;#39;s lying I actually have a</text>
  <text start="881.53" dur="4.35">good question well how did people prove</text>
  <text start="883.99" dur="4.17">that did they have the archived stuff</text>
  <text start="885.88" dur="4.35">and then they put you know side by side</text>
  <text start="888.16" dur="3.6">with whatever he tweeted or that proof</text>
  <text start="890.23" dur="3.27">well I just I just I didn&amp;#39;t even make a</text>
  <text start="891.76" dur="3.33">video where I showed I just I should</text>

  <text start="898.93" dur="3.45">like look he&amp;#39;s using that look at the</text>
  <text start="900.82" dur="3.54">look at his recent timeline it was on</text>
  <text start="902.38" dur="3.54">there was I was like a couple weeks back</text>
  <text start="904.36" dur="2.91">before he blocked me and said I was</text>
  <text start="905.92" dur="4.8">attacking his dead child or something</text>
  <text start="907.27" dur="5.379">like that but he had he had a post of a</text>
  <text start="910.72" dur="3.789">queue post it was normal in every way</text>
  <text start="912.649" dur="3.3">but the time was changed and all you had</text>
  <text start="914.509" dur="4.8">to do was go to any of the queue archive</text>
  <text start="915.949" dur="5.13">sites like like queuing on dog or</text>
  <text start="919.309" dur="4.44">something I think that one&amp;#39;s down now or</text>
  <text start="921.079" dur="4.86">hacked down or something that was the</text>
  <text start="923.749" dur="4.411">main one but you go to any of those and</text>
  <text start="925.939" dur="3.63">you just compare and you can tell that</text>
  <text start="928.16" dur="2.25">the time has been changed it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="929.569" dur="2.971">photoshopped</text>
  <text start="930.41" dur="4.709">and I don&amp;#39;t know if Lee did it himself</text>
  <text start="932.54" dur="4.409">he shared it from someone else and I</text>
  <text start="935.119" dur="4.371">know that he talks a lot about you know</text>
  <text start="936.949" dur="4.92">you know epistemology and reason and</text>
  <text start="939.49" dur="3.849">verifying your evidence and logic and</text>

  <text start="946.73" dur="5.579">didn&amp;#39;t he didn&amp;#39;t verify obviously so</text>
  <text start="948.589" dur="6.54">either he was just trying to you know</text>
  <text start="952.309" dur="4.741">use this BS argument or he knew better I</text>
  <text start="955.129" dur="3.18">don&amp;#39;t know with Lee I tend to think he</text>
  <text start="957.05" dur="2.969">knows better some people I just think</text>
  <text start="958.309" dur="3.51">are stupid but he you know he</text>
  <text start="960.019" dur="3.81">understands logic so he&amp;#39;s abusing it in</text>

  <text start="1054.239" dur="5.28">beyond all odds of probability</text>
  <text start="1056.249" dur="5.52">you know Q&amp;#39;s and Trump are finishing</text>
  <text start="1059.519" dur="4.831">each other sentences at this point so</text>
  <text start="1061.769" dur="4.201">and and everything that that Q has said</text>
  <text start="1064.35" dur="4.559">not all of it has come true and stuff</text>
  <text start="1065.97" dur="6.24">but the narrative is playing out the way</text>
  <text start="1068.909" dur="4.98">he&amp;#39;s predicted so yeah I predict you</text>
  <text start="1072.21" dur="3.24">know based on everything that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1073.889" dur="3.691">I mean let&amp;#39;s croakin agrees with me on</text>

  <text start="1080.73" dur="4.079">coming and she&amp;#39;s like he said on a scale</text>
  <text start="1082.769" dur="4.11">of one to ten she&amp;#39;s like a thousand by I</text>
  <text start="1084.809" dur="4.8">think she said November 11th but which</text>
  <text start="1086.879" dur="4.561">is a big value but yeah and I agree with</text>
  <text start="1089.609" dur="4.44">her I think that we after the midterms</text>
  <text start="1091.44" dur="4.619">we will see the mid-level arrests and</text>
  <text start="1094.049" dur="4.95">then I think after 2020 we will see the</text>
  <text start="1096.059" dur="4.98">big arrests because anything before</text>
  <text start="1098.999" dur="3.841">those events they&amp;#39;re gonna try to play</text>
  <text start="1101.039" dur="3.901">politics and say you know this is</text>
  <text start="1102.84" dur="4.86">tyranny this is trying to shut down the</text>
  <text start="1104.94" dur="4.199">free election blah blah blah and in 2020</text>
  <text start="1107.7" dur="3.12">like all the people that are suddenly</text>

  <text start="1114.029" dur="4.561">down his competitors so you know what do</text>
  <text start="1117.149" dur="2.821">you do you have to play the game and</text>
  <text start="1118.59" dur="3.689">that&amp;#39;s what he talks about learning to</text>
  <text start="1119.97" dur="3.809">play the game and people are in a rush</text>
  <text start="1122.279" dur="3.6">and people get very upset thinking</text>
  <text start="1123.779" dur="4.171">nothing&amp;#39;s being done but we have we have</text>
  <text start="1125.879" dur="4.02">Hueber we have and Huber is basically</text>

  <text start="1139.019" dur="4.711">Huber so it stands to reason that Huber</text>

  <text start="1149.73" dur="4.199">you know it&amp;#39;s not all that like that</text>
  <text start="1152.07" dur="3.449">just like the step downs over 4100</text>

  <text start="1161.73" dur="4.259">going on and nothing else explains</text>
  <text start="1164.22" dur="3.689">what&amp;#39;s going on better than queueing on</text>
  <text start="1165.989" dur="4.38">nothing else matches up and if you trust</text>
  <text start="1167.909" dur="4.291">Trump they are obviously playing some</text>
  <text start="1170.369" dur="3.03">kind of game back and forth with the</text>

  <text start="1190.64" dur="4.11">recently he basically said that hillary</text>
  <text start="1192.74" dur="3.93">was going to get now and i did a video</text>
  <text start="1194.75" dur="4.17">on this and everything is happening a</text>
  <text start="1196.67" dur="4.65">lot of people don&amp;#39;t want to believe a</text>

  <text start="1201.32" dur="2.97">at this point how to convince them i</text>
  <text start="1202.97" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t try anymore to convince them I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1204.29" dur="3.96">just you know I talk about the news at</text>

  <text start="1210.94" dur="4.99">flying coach there was a couple weeks</text>
  <text start="1213.32" dur="4.47">ago Laura Loomer several people brought</text>
  <text start="1215.93" dur="4.8">those assets were seized I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1217.79" dur="4.98">ma&amp;#39;am or you know or they are they you</text>
  <text start="1220.73" dur="6.21">know did they take away some of their</text>
  <text start="1222.77" dur="6.06">presidential benefits because they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="1226.94" dur="4.02">you know do they have ankle bracelets</text>
  <text start="1228.83" dur="3.99">basically you know there was a big</text>
  <text start="1230.96" dur="4.05">theory about angle bracelets a lot of</text>
  <text start="1232.82" dur="4.26">people in positions of suspicion were</text>
  <text start="1235.01" dur="5.37">wearing them John McCain kept switching</text>
  <text start="1237.08" dur="6.3">his back and forth you know so obviously</text>
  <text start="1240.38" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not a he&amp;#39;s cast back and</text>
  <text start="1243.38" dur="4.34">forth so obviously it wasn&amp;#39;t the broken</text>
  <text start="1244.91" dur="7.62">leg or anything maybe he was hiding one</text>
  <text start="1247.72" dur="6.85">couple other questions so well I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="1252.53" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;m gonna get to Q plus in a second</text>
  <text start="1254.57" dur="4.38">because every once in a while Q puts Q</text>
  <text start="1256.94" dur="4.59">plus and I did a theory video that</text>
  <text start="1258.95" dur="5.7">people cute q and on people hated I</text>
  <text start="1261.53" dur="5.61">literally said I figured it out and I I</text>
  <text start="1264.65" dur="6.27">said that Q is on the same button as</text>
  <text start="1267.14" dur="6.15">plus on an iPhone and on Android and I</text>
  <text start="1270.92" dur="4.92">said Q has a really big thumb</text>
  <text start="1273.29" dur="4.38">and he just held it down I mean</text>
  <text start="1275.84" dur="4.14">literally you can accidentally DoubleTap</text>
  <text start="1277.67" dur="4.32">Q plus I have to have fun with this and</text>
  <text start="1279.98" dur="3.54">Q makes typos give me and I I made it</text>
  <text start="1281.99" dur="4.47">like a super serious video if you go</text>
  <text start="1283.52" dur="4.94">back like I got a lot of trolls hating</text>
  <text start="1286.46" dur="6.36">me for that but I was just joking around</text>
  <text start="1288.46" dur="6.91">but before that I want to say like so a</text>
  <text start="1292.82" dur="6.45">lot of people say that Q predicts and</text>
  <text start="1295.37" dur="10.77">the other side and I have said before</text>
  <text start="1299.27" dur="9.72">it&amp;#39;s like Q always but well one let me</text>
  <text start="1306.14" dur="3.15">get let me get the question out all</text>
  <text start="1308.99" dur="2.39">right</text>
  <text start="1309.29" dur="5.509">name three predictions and</text>
  <text start="1311.38" dur="5.94">- my opinion is that it&amp;#39;s usually stuff</text>
  <text start="1314.799" dur="4.021">after it&amp;#39;s happened and then he shares</text>
  <text start="1317.32" dur="5.099">the articles or that&amp;#39;s what it looks</text>
  <text start="1318.82" dur="5.19">like to someone like me okay so that we</text>
  <text start="1322.419" dur="4.111">go back to the time stamp stuff if you</text>
  <text start="1324.01" dur="4.62">go to Cooper&amp;#39;s calm and not every single</text>
  <text start="1326.53" dur="3.93">thing is a time stamp proof just because</text>
  <text start="1328.63" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s it might look like one at first but</text>
  <text start="1330.46" dur="4.349">you know there are like I think dozens</text>
  <text start="1332.71" dur="4.02">of them where he predicted future events</text>
  <text start="1334.809" dur="3.931">where he predicted news that wasn&amp;#39;t out</text>
  <text start="1336.73" dur="5.9">yet you know like some of these some of</text>
  <text start="1338.74" dur="6.12">the names that were in some of these I</text>
  <text start="1342.63" dur="3.31">care more the details it was some of the</text>
  <text start="1344.86" dur="2.699">names that were involved in the whole</text>
  <text start="1345.94" dur="3.33">FBI corruption and he knew about the</text>
  <text start="1347.559" dur="3.061">investigation like months before you</text>
  <text start="1349.27" dur="3.779">knew about Huber months I think months</text>
  <text start="1350.62" dur="4.11">before so a lot of these things he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1353.049" dur="3.99">called months ahead of time and in some</text>
  <text start="1354.73" dur="3.99">of the things he&amp;#39;s called 15 minutes you</text>
  <text start="1357.039" dur="4.531">know whatever the Delta is five minutes</text>
  <text start="1358.72" dur="4.62">15 minutes an hour whatever that was</text>
  <text start="1361.57" dur="4.68">that day usually there&amp;#39;s a meaning to it</text>
  <text start="1363.34" dur="4.77">and I&amp;#39;m not that deep into it but you</text>
  <text start="1366.25" dur="4.89">know he will say things ahead of time</text>
  <text start="1368.11" dur="5.04">and then later on POTUS is on Twitter</text>
  <text start="1371.14" dur="3.419">account or someone else like like the</text>
  <text start="1373.15" dur="3.57">military accounts or something they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1374.559" dur="4.531">basically like repeat exactly what he</text>
  <text start="1376.72" dur="4.53">said verbatim or something very similar</text>
  <text start="1379.09" dur="3.54">or in the same vein so you know I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1381.25" dur="2.97">I can&amp;#39;t predict all I can&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="1382.63" dur="3.06">every single one of those right now and</text>
  <text start="1384.22" dur="5.73">pull up all that data from my memory but</text>
  <text start="1385.69" dur="8.64">he proves is full of them you know well</text>
  <text start="1389.95" dur="5.76">and but I I the thing is is I&amp;#39;ve asked</text>
  <text start="1394.33" dur="3.38">several people and they can&amp;#39;t name a</text>
  <text start="1395.71" dur="4.68">specific thing that they actually</text>
  <text start="1397.71" dur="4.69">predicted and that&amp;#39;s why I try to be</text>
  <text start="1400.39" dur="4.01">discerning and just say like you know is</text>
  <text start="1402.4" dur="4.889">there a big event that they said</text>
  <text start="1404.4" dur="5.47">something very specific and then it</text>
  <text start="1407.289" dur="4.831">happened do you can you remember one I</text>
  <text start="1409.87" dur="3.6">can probably try to find something while</text>
  <text start="1412.12" dur="5.189">we&amp;#39;re talking here you&amp;#39;re on cue proofs</text>
  <text start="1413.47" dur="5.97">and refresh my memory and stuff like I</text>
  <text start="1417.309" dur="4.11">said this is a friendly chat like yeah</text>
  <text start="1419.44" dur="3.63">the the thing like the thing that</text>
  <text start="1421.419" dur="3.181">happened with you goober was one and</text>
  <text start="1423.07" dur="3.15">then there were the 13 names a night I</text>
  <text start="1424.6" dur="3.059">don&amp;#39;t even honestly like health atop my</text>
  <text start="1426.22" dur="3.99">head I can&amp;#39;t even wear the 13 names were</text>
  <text start="1427.659" dur="4.321">about but then they came out like a way</text>
  <text start="1430.21" dur="3.719">ahead of time and it was as initials you</text>
  <text start="1431.98" dur="3.63">know so it wasn&amp;#39;t the kind of thing that</text>
  <text start="1433.929" dur="4.351">you knew what it was until after it had</text>
  <text start="1435.61" dur="4.23">happened but then in retrospect as Q</text>
  <text start="1438.28" dur="3.84">says future proves past so then it</text>
  <text start="1439.84" dur="4.589">became obvious what it meant like in</text>
  <text start="1442.12" dur="3.16">retrospect so that that&amp;#39;s the kind of</text>
  <text start="1444.429" dur="3.221">thing I was talking to</text>
  <text start="1445.28" dur="5.49">and and cue Prosis got a lot of those</text>
  <text start="1447.65" dur="7.05">things and not just the timestamp things</text>
  <text start="1450.77" dur="5.07">but some stuff like that - yeah I can</text>
  <text start="1454.7" dur="3.51">get back to you on that though at the</text>
  <text start="1455.84" dur="5.34">end no I mean yeah but it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="1458.21" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s not huge and like I said I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1461.18" dur="4.2">like one thing I wanted to talk to you</text>
  <text start="1463.04" dur="3.93">about - is do you feel like the truth</text>
  <text start="1465.38" dur="3.81">community has been tearing each other</text>
  <text start="1466.97" dur="4.17">apart not only are we split up in the</text>
  <text start="1469.19" dur="4.65">country between you know Hillary or</text>
  <text start="1471.14" dur="6.18">Trump but even in our small community</text>
  <text start="1473.84" dur="5.82">everybody is tearing each other apart so</text>
  <text start="1477.32" dur="4.5">what the way I think the narrative in my</text>
  <text start="1479.66" dur="6.39">mind that makes the most sense lately is</text>
  <text start="1481.82" dur="6.18">that cue at first was basically all</text>
  <text start="1486.05" dur="4.5">about just exposing the figures right</text>
  <text start="1488" dur="4.5">and that was kind of like the big</text>
  <text start="1490.55" dur="3.57">movement the big mission was to have us</text>
  <text start="1492.5" dur="3.63">expose the fake news to build a counter</text>
  <text start="1494.12" dur="4.41">resistance against fake news to get the</text>
  <text start="1496.13" dur="3.75">truth out there and then it seems like</text>
  <text start="1498.53" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re well done at this point we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1499.88" dur="5.37">cooked them no one trusts them anymore</text>
  <text start="1501.8" dur="6.69">except like antiphon stuff so beyond</text>
  <text start="1505.25" dur="5.37">that now it seems like he will kind of</text>
  <text start="1508.49" dur="5.19">wants us to expose the fake news within</text>
  <text start="1510.62" dur="4.29">the alt media the fake magaz which i</text>
  <text start="1513.68" dur="3.09">think is a term that you actually got</text>
  <text start="1514.91" dur="3.15">from me I&amp;#39;m not sure about that but I</text>
  <text start="1516.77" dur="3.66">started using that term and everybody</text>
  <text start="1518.06" dur="3.72">else was using Patriots with a Y but</text>
  <text start="1520.43" dur="3.3">then you have to explain the why part</text>
  <text start="1521.78" dur="3.45">because it sounds just like Patriots so</text>
  <text start="1523.73" dur="3.51">I didn&amp;#39;t like that term as much as I did</text>
  <text start="1525.23" dur="4.26">fake magaz and I started using this term</text>
  <text start="1527.24" dur="4.17">about people like like Jack for sobic</text>
  <text start="1529.49" dur="6.39">and stuff and and maybe even Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="1531.41" dur="6.99">I don&amp;#39;t know so you know to expose fake</text>
  <text start="1535.88" dur="4.71">news and Liars is is going to at some</text>
  <text start="1538.4" dur="4.86">point have to expose those within our</text>

  <text start="1543.26" dur="2.88">lot of hate from that obviously</text>
  <text start="1544.76" dur="3.21">especially with Alex Jones I&amp;#39;m getting</text>
  <text start="1546.14" dur="4.62">tons of pushback even from my own</text>
  <text start="1547.97" dur="5.34">audience it&amp;#39;s a lot of hate about Alex</text>
  <text start="1550.76" dur="4.68">Jones and stuff but I&amp;#39;m not really</text>
  <text start="1553.31" dur="4.17">trying to create like problems or strife</text>

  <text start="1754.1" dur="3.78">he just drops the ball when it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1755.72" dur="5.13">most important time maybe he&amp;#39;s there to</text>

  <text start="1783.35" dur="3.93">this is just where I&amp;#39;m thinking the</text>
  <text start="1785.059" dur="3.99">evidence is leading me and a lot of this</text>
  <text start="1787.28" dur="4.74">is because Q has called him out three</text>
  <text start="1789.049" dur="7.201">four times now okay he called him out my</text>
  <text start="1792.02" dur="6.389">name or just by like recently he</text>
  <text start="1796.25" dur="4.71">basically called there was somebody that</text>
  <text start="1798.409" dur="5.25">went on and posted a video of Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="1800.96" dur="4.469">and talking about the censorship and it</text>
  <text start="1803.659" dur="5.851">was not in a positive light and then</text>
  <text start="1805.429" dur="6.63">Hugh said actors will act you know so he</text>
  <text start="1809.51" dur="4.56">also had put that link about or had</text>

  <text start="1822.409" dur="5.671">posted bill Cooper references where bill</text>
  <text start="1824.63" dur="6.029">Cooper had had basically called out Alex</text>
  <text start="1828.08" dur="4.65">Jones as a disinfo agent way back in the</text>

  <text start="2185.52" dur="3.75">proof that you need but it&amp;#39;s often easy</text>
  <text start="2187.68" dur="3.48">to catch them because just like people</text>
  <text start="2189.27" dur="3.42">who smoke pot and they not they&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="2200.22" dur="3.69">culture of people that are like them</text>
  <text start="2201.75" dur="4.83">okay because there&amp;#39;s too many of them to</text>
  <text start="2203.91" dur="4.08">know each other that&amp;#39;s how bad it is so</text>
  <text start="2206.58" dur="4.11">yeah we&amp;#39;re at that point where we have</text>
  <text start="2207.99" dur="4.89">to be suspect at this point any single</text>
  <text start="2210.69" dur="3.84">any humanitarian aid worker should be</text>
  <text start="2212.88" dur="4.44">suspected of being a pedophile because</text>
  <text start="2214.53" dur="5.04">we have seen a trend a large trend of</text>
  <text start="2217.32" dur="4.2">this happening we have seen it with the</text>
  <text start="2219.57" dur="3.54">UN aid workers I mean in some cases</text>
  <text start="2221.52" dur="3.93">these women in these served world</text>
  <text start="2223.11" dur="4.35">countries won&amp;#39;t even show up to a to a</text>
  <text start="2225.45" dur="3.36">peacekeeper aid station because they</text>
  <text start="2227.46" dur="5.4">know they&amp;#39;re going to get raped you know</text>
  <text start="2228.81" dur="5.22">is that bad so we should always be</text>
  <text start="2232.86" dur="2.52">suspect we should really be asking</text>
  <text start="2234.03" dur="3.36">questions of these people that are</text>
  <text start="2235.38" dur="4.47">claiming to be moral and then running</text>
  <text start="2237.39" dur="5.36">these events or charities or groups that</text>
  <text start="2239.85" dur="5.37">help children or whatever it is okay so</text>
  <text start="2242.75" dur="3.13">you know it just keeps getting deeper</text>
  <text start="2245.22" dur="2.4">and deeper</text>
  <text start="2245.88" dur="3.75">then we have the most powerful</text>
  <text start="2247.62" dur="3.84">investigative force on the planet at our</text>
  <text start="2249.63" dur="4.83">disposal that&amp;#39;s the open source and on</text>
  <text start="2251.46" dur="5.16">community where billions of people would</text>
  <text start="2254.46" dur="3.9">there with all of their various talents</text>
  <text start="2256.62" dur="5.01">connections and experiences and and and</text>
  <text start="2258.36" dur="7.38">and everything are just hive minding at</text>
  <text start="2261.63" dur="6.45">all so you know this is a very strong</text>
  <text start="2265.74" dur="5.25">position to be in at this point because</text>
  <text start="2268.08" dur="5.1">we have so much evidence of so many bad</text>
  <text start="2270.99" dur="4.86">actors so I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a bad thing</text>
  <text start="2273.18" dur="4.47">to be asking questions and opening doors</text>
  <text start="2275.85" dur="3.33">I don&amp;#39;t think you should make baseless</text>
  <text start="2277.65" dur="3.84">accusations I don&amp;#39;t even think that you</text>
  <text start="2279.18" dur="3.36">should even if you suspect or believe</text>
  <text start="2281.49" dur="2.88">that they&amp;#39;re a pedophile you shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2282.54" dur="3.33">be like I can prove he&amp;#39;s a pedophile or</text>
  <text start="2284.37" dur="2.76">I think he said you know I think that</text>
  <text start="2285.87" dur="3.27">you should be like okay look here&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="2287.13" dur="3.54">we know and tell people this don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="2289.14" dur="3.18">be like he&amp;#39;s a pedophile you&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="2290.67" dur="4.68">look I think he may be a pedophile and</text>
  <text start="2292.32" dur="4.53">here&amp;#39;s why because there are people that</text>
  <text start="2295.35" dur="3.06">are very logical and reasonable and they</text>
  <text start="2296.85" dur="2.91">don&amp;#39;t know about all this stuff and they</text>
  <text start="2298.41" dur="3.03">will not believe you just because you</text>
  <text start="2299.76" dur="3">think something you need to show the</text>
  <text start="2301.44" dur="3.27">evidence you need to show the pattern</text>
  <text start="2302.76" dur="3.75">and if they don&amp;#39;t believe it and tell</text>
  <text start="2304.71" dur="4.17">them to go look at Podesta art well this</text>
  <text start="2306.51" dur="5.01">the small chance that they&amp;#39;re lying that</text>
  <text start="2308.88" dur="4.74">that is the worst label that anyone</text>
  <text start="2311.52" dur="5.52">could ever get especially is I mean if</text>
  <text start="2313.62" dur="5.73">you were not a pedo and you were called</text>

  <text start="2319.35" dur="4.8">quickly I think in fact it&amp;#39;s just been</text>
  <text start="2321.84" dur="5.64">thrown around so much lately Elon Musk</text>
  <text start="2324.15" dur="6">calling that the the diver of the pedo</text>

  <text start="2543.569" dur="3.18">that because cicada was a super</text>
  <text start="2545.16" dur="3.359">complicated if you followed that stuff I</text>
  <text start="2546.749" dur="3.75">was I was following that stuff it was</text>
  <text start="2548.519" dur="4.23">really impressive I mean it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="2550.499" dur="4.23">like a like a just a test run for for</text>
  <text start="2552.749" dur="4.59">something like you I mean but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2554.729" dur="3.99">think that&amp;#39;s connected and maybe as a I</text>
  <text start="2557.339" dur="2.7">think I think cicada was like a</text>
  <text start="2558.719" dur="3.54">recruitment tool for some high-level</text>
  <text start="2560.039" dur="5.101">intelligence stuff but you know some</text>
  <text start="2562.259" dur="6.391">high IQ focus because cicada was</text>
  <text start="2565.14" dur="5.639">apparently ex NSA members who made</text>
  <text start="2568.65" dur="4.23">puzzles that were so complicated that if</text>
  <text start="2570.779" dur="4.23">you did figure it out it was like if</text>
  <text start="2572.88" dur="4.079">you&amp;#39;re in the club it was a challenge</text>
  <text start="2575.009" dur="4.381">yeah you were in you were in cicada</text>
  <text start="2576.959" dur="5.64">if you could figure out these puzzles it</text>
  <text start="2579.39" dur="5.28">started even like geo tag geo hashing or</text>
  <text start="2582.599" dur="4.291">whatever you call it where you you solve</text>
  <text start="2584.67" dur="4.349">puzzles and fine I mean some guy found</text>
  <text start="2586.89" dur="4.859">$10,000 hidden somewhere because he</text>
  <text start="2589.019" dur="5.76">figured out these puzzles that&amp;#39;s become</text>
  <text start="2591.749" dur="6.87">a trend now in like the secret kind of</text>
  <text start="2594.779" dur="6.51">Thunder world sure yeah so as far as</text>
  <text start="2598.619" dur="3.96">cicada here is my thing and I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="2601.289" dur="3.57">this many times in my channel</text>
  <text start="2602.579" dur="4.47">the original Q when I was covering it</text>
  <text start="2604.859" dur="4.38">and by the way I was getting a thousand</text>
  <text start="2607.049" dur="6.51">subscribers a day or whatever it was</text>
  <text start="2609.239" dur="7.86">crazy when I was covering Q but when the</text>
  <text start="2613.559" dur="6.51">trip code changed the first Q or how I</text>
  <text start="2617.099" dur="4.38">call it the first Q it seemed like it</text>
  <text start="2620.069" dur="3.601">was a puzzle you could actually count</text>
  <text start="2621.479" dur="4.05">the spaces and then count out a number</text>
  <text start="2623.67" dur="3.539">that correspond to something else like</text>
  <text start="2625.529" dur="3.45">me and my wife would sit there for hours</text>
  <text start="2627.209" dur="4.5">and try to figure out what they meant</text>
  <text start="2628.979" dur="4.921">and you could connect them in like the</text>
  <text start="2631.709" dur="5.07">ones with like black forest and the</text>
  <text start="2633.9" dur="7.349">rothschilds fire fire sale when they</text>
  <text start="2636.779" dur="7.41">were selling that Hungarian the cabin</text>
  <text start="2641.249" dur="4.831">yeah we&amp;#39;re all thinking man the</text>
  <text start="2644.189" dur="4.171">Rothschilds are gathering up cash</text>
  <text start="2646.08" dur="5.34">like it&amp;#39;s about to be the it&amp;#39;s about to</text>
  <text start="2648.36" dur="4.8">be apocalypse you know why do they need</text>
  <text start="2651.42" dur="4.61">all this cash and then another</text>
  <text start="2653.16" dur="5.58">Rothschild was getting donations and</text>
  <text start="2656.03" dur="3.94">openly said he was only giving 30% to</text>
  <text start="2658.74" dur="4.17">something else and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="2659.97" dur="4.86">gathering cash I think they were had</text>
  <text start="2662.91" dur="4.59">their assets frozen by that executive</text>
  <text start="2664.83" dur="5.55">order oh because they were involved in</text>
  <text start="2667.5" dur="5.16">child yeah and look at look at what</text>
  <text start="2670.38" dur="4.41">happened with the the Rothschild estate</text>
  <text start="2672.66" dur="5.16">where the the plane and the helicopter</text>
  <text start="2674.79" dur="5.1">crashed crashed and yeah like nose nose</text>
  <text start="2677.82" dur="4.05">dive kamikaze style and you can verify</text>
  <text start="2679.89" dur="3.42">this I did this when I this was the</text>
  <text start="2681.87" dur="3.54">first proof that I used to get Slee</text>
  <text start="2683.31" dur="4.23">Stranahan and in the one proof per day</text>
  <text start="2685.41" dur="4.14">and he never responded I showed him the</text>
  <text start="2687.54" dur="4.44">charts and I showed him the plane</text>
  <text start="2689.55" dur="3.93">the guys who do the plane tracking and</text>
  <text start="2691.98" dur="3.15">showed us how you know all of this stuff</text>
  <text start="2693.48" dur="3.9">was really weird with the planes and</text>
  <text start="2695.13" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re the ones who caught over over</text>
  <text start="2697.38" dur="3.21">Vegas they caught the helicopters with</text>
  <text start="2698.88" dur="3">the transponders off like for five</text>
  <text start="2700.59" dur="2.94">minutes floating over one of the</text>
  <text start="2701.88" dur="3.93">buildings and everything else these guys</text>
  <text start="2703.53" dur="4.02">are good you know remember it like these</text>
  <text start="2705.81" dur="3.87">guys are the same ones that took bound</text>
  <text start="2707.55" dur="3.84">that stupid flag every time that Shia</text>
  <text start="2709.68" dur="3.84">LaBeouf kept moving and he moved it in a</text>
  <text start="2711.39" dur="3.84">room they used the clouds and the light</text>
  <text start="2713.52" dur="3.93">to find it they move he moved it</text>
  <text start="2715.23" dur="4.08">underground and they still found it like</text>
  <text start="2717.45" dur="3.69">these guys can find these things if they</text>
  <text start="2719.31" dur="3.57">need so you know they tracked down every</text>
  <text start="2721.14" dur="4.41">little bit of the data and and we can</text>
  <text start="2722.88" dur="5.67">verify that this attack happened in just</text>
  <text start="2725.55" dur="4.95">the way that Q described and you know</text>
  <text start="2728.55" dur="6.42">the Rothschilds are are in this there</text>
  <text start="2730.5" dur="5.7">for sure involved well what do you think</text>
  <text start="2734.97" dur="2.58">about the other families like the</text>
  <text start="2736.2" dur="4.98">Rockefellers do you think that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2737.55" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re tied into it too Hugh says he</text>
  <text start="2741.18" dur="4.53">said something like watch the bloodlines</text>
  <text start="2742.53" dur="4.59">like I&amp;#39;ve got a few viewers of mine that</text>
  <text start="2745.71" dur="2.94">don&amp;#39;t think that this theory is right</text>
  <text start="2747.12" dur="2.82">they think that the Rothschilds are just</text>
  <text start="2748.65" dur="2.61">you know they&amp;#39;re a big name but they</text>
  <text start="2749.94" dur="2.94">don&amp;#39;t have that much power anymore I</text>
  <text start="2751.26" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t buy that I think that they are</text>
  <text start="2752.88" dur="4.02">powerful and I think that you don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="2755.31" dur="3.54">that kind of multi-generational wealth</text>
  <text start="2756.9" dur="3.75">and just and that kind of control and</text>
  <text start="2758.85" dur="3.45">the Federal Reserve System and all of</text>
  <text start="2760.65" dur="3.54">that in your power and then just lose it</text>
  <text start="2762.3" dur="3.51">I think these guys have gotten more</text>
  <text start="2764.19" dur="3.21">power than ever and I think that the</text>
  <text start="2765.81" dur="3.6">Rothschilds and the other you know the</text>
  <text start="2767.4" dur="3.72">Illuminati family bloodlines whatever</text>
  <text start="2769.41" dur="3.84">you want to call them I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2771.12" dur="3.81">the plague upon the planet and you know</text>
  <text start="2773.25" dur="3.45">go watch that Jay Meyers documentary</text>
  <text start="2774.93" dur="3.99">about weird ways of the elite you know</text>
  <text start="2776.7" dur="3.12">these people create psychopathic</text>
  <text start="2778.92" dur="1.95">children by torque</text>
  <text start="2779.82" dur="2.4">bringing them and raping them and all</text>
  <text start="2780.87" dur="3.36">this other stuff when they&amp;#39;re children</text>
  <text start="2782.22" dur="3.24">you know and then that&amp;#39;s a way to snap</text>
  <text start="2784.23" dur="3.66">them and get that hole in Kaltura</text>
  <text start="2785.46" dur="4.68">Psychopaths going you know multiple</text>
  <text start="2787.89" dur="4.65">personalities that they can control so</text>
  <text start="2790.14" dur="4.26">yeah they&amp;#39;re involved and I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2792.54" dur="3.6">to what level which ones are involved I</text>
  <text start="2794.4" dur="3.48">remember that time when Lynn Rothschild</text>
  <text start="2796.14" dur="3.96">was on the board and apparently said</text>
  <text start="2797.88" dur="4.14">that we&amp;#39;re all gonna die of thirst and a</text>
  <text start="2800.1" dur="3.56">dungeon after our families were murdered</text>
  <text start="2802.02" dur="3.99">in front of us that was interesting</text>
  <text start="2803.66" dur="2.83">and then Q told her don&amp;#39;t come here</text>
  <text start="2806.01" dur="1.86">again</text>
  <text start="2806.49" dur="4.98">you&amp;#39;re having trouble sleeping tonight I</text>
  <text start="2807.87" dur="5.61">hear well what I just remember we get</text>
  <text start="2811.47" dur="3.96">him you know what I&amp;#39;m saying though back</text>
  <text start="2813.48" dur="4.92">then it was it was much more complicated</text>
  <text start="2815.43" dur="5.55">now do you think that that Q is evolved</text>
  <text start="2818.4" dur="4.44">into something less I think it had to be</text>
  <text start="2820.98" dur="4.2">and I think he was gotten more I won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2822.84" dur="3.96">say confident but he&amp;#39;s gotten more over</text>
  <text start="2825.18" dur="3.45">and more blatant and I think that&amp;#39;s part</text>
  <text start="2826.8" dur="4.32">of the part of the plan you know at</text>
  <text start="2828.63" dur="4.05">first it was a whisper now it&amp;#39;s a shout</text>
  <text start="2831.12" dur="3.24">now it&amp;#39;s a scream now he&amp;#39;s having fun</text>
  <text start="2832.68" dur="2.94">with it you can tell from the way he</text>
  <text start="2834.36" dur="4.53">talks now you know he&amp;#39;s more of a</text>
  <text start="2835.62" dur="6">smartass so that&amp;#39;s another thing it do</text>
  <text start="2838.89" dur="4.8">you I mean you you basically know that</text>
  <text start="2841.62" dur="4.26">this is somebody whatever group of</text>
  <text start="2843.69" dur="5.07">people is doing it is on a phone half of</text>
  <text start="2845.88" dur="6.57">the time right mmm because they they</text>
  <text start="2848.76" dur="6.66">they post mobile links they post mobile</text>
  <text start="2852.45" dur="6.66">links some of the pictures you can tell</text>
  <text start="2855.42" dur="5.28">what kind of phone it&amp;#39;s off of but when</text>
  <text start="2859.11" dur="4.02">it started it was like a really old</text>
  <text start="2860.7" dur="5.88">iPhone and I do believe that too because</text>
  <text start="2863.13" dur="6.51">I had the exact same iPhone and that was</text>
  <text start="2866.58" dur="6.21">one point that was made now it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2869.64" dur="5.07">you can tell it&amp;#39;s a super nice camera</text>
  <text start="2872.79" dur="4.2">all this stuff and then the links</text>
  <text start="2874.71" dur="5.22">somebody has said that this is now like</text>
  <text start="2876.99" dur="5.7">an S 9 plus super nice phone</text>
  <text start="2879.93" dur="4.35">I don&amp;#39;t I haven&amp;#39;t seen all the theory</text>
  <text start="2882.69" dur="2.82">about the cell phones changing and stuff</text>
  <text start="2884.28" dur="2.76">like that I don&amp;#39;t know much about that</text>
  <text start="2885.51" dur="2.79">but you know if they&amp;#39;re using a phone</text>
  <text start="2887.04" dur="2.91">then they&amp;#39;re probably using burner</text>
  <text start="2888.3" dur="3.09">phones and if they&amp;#39;re using older ones</text>
  <text start="2889.95" dur="4.02">then they probably had they ran out of</text>
  <text start="2891.39" dur="5.52">them by now because you know well but</text>
  <text start="2893.97" dur="6.66">you have people made a lot of money off</text>
  <text start="2896.91" dur="5.94">of this movement okay so that&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="2900.63" dur="4.08">theory I mean some people like dr. Corsi</text>
  <text start="2902.85" dur="3.93">have been like really pushing things</text>
  <text start="2904.71" dur="4.26">like their book really hard and had a</text>
  <text start="2906.78" dur="5.16">lot of eyes on them and some peeps um</text>
  <text start="2908.97" dur="4.09">channels get a lot of viewers but you</text>
  <text start="2911.94" dur="3.28">know</text>
  <text start="2913.06" dur="4.2">my all I can do is speak from my</text>
  <text start="2915.22" dur="4.23">personal experience I work a hundred</text>
  <text start="2917.26" dur="4.109">hours a week and I make like two grand</text>
  <text start="2919.45" dur="3.78">maybe three grand a month off donations</text>
  <text start="2921.369" dur="4.951">and stuff I&amp;#39;m making less than minimum</text>
  <text start="2923.23" dur="4.71">wage basically no I&amp;#39;m not making a lot</text>
  <text start="2926.32" dur="4.35">of money off of this I would like to and</text>
  <text start="2927.94" dur="4.05">I probably I think I deserve to because</text>
  <text start="2930.67" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s a free market and if you bring</text>
  <text start="2931.99" dur="4.32">value to people great I&amp;#39;m not making</text>
  <text start="2934.27" dur="4.17">millions of dollars to lie to people you</text>
  <text start="2936.31" dur="4.11">know like Anderson Cooper and on some of</text>
  <text start="2938.44" dur="3.69">these MSM people I would like to make a</text>
  <text start="2940.42" dur="3.42">decent living support my family because</text>
  <text start="2942.13" dur="5.01">I have an obligation to my child and my</text>
  <text start="2943.84" dur="4.62">wife but you know is you know what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2947.14" dur="2.729">like you&amp;#39;ve got a family to support</text>
  <text start="2948.46" dur="4.29">you know we deserve to make a good</text>
  <text start="2949.869" dur="4.321">living in fact you know I think that the</text>
  <text start="2952.75" dur="3.18">truth tellers and this isn&amp;#39;t patient</text>
  <text start="2954.19" dur="3.69">position I had long before I became one</text>
  <text start="2955.93" dur="3.72">of them is that the truth teller should</text>
  <text start="2957.88" dur="4.29">be making far more money than the MSM</text>
  <text start="2959.65" dur="4.68">people okay but evil pays and good</text>
  <text start="2962.17" dur="3.689">doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily so instead I have to</text>
  <text start="2964.33" dur="4.14">deal with being banned and having my</text>
  <text start="2965.859" dur="4.351">entire account taken away from me I have</text>
  <text start="2968.47" dur="3.75">to deal with shadow bands where my</text>
  <text start="2970.21" dur="4.11">engagement on Twitter has dropped 90%</text>
  <text start="2972.22" dur="4.23">okay in the last couple weeks I have to</text>
  <text start="2974.32" dur="4.049">deal with all of this and I can</text>
  <text start="2976.45" dur="4.08">barely eat got a living doing it but I</text>
  <text start="2978.369" dur="3.571">do it out of complete passion for this</text>
  <text start="2980.53" dur="3.12">job and I don&amp;#39;t care if I have to eat</text>
  <text start="2981.94" dur="5.04">bread and drink water I will keep doing</text>
  <text start="2983.65" dur="5.4">it well here&amp;#39;s the thing and our</text>
  <text start="2986.98" dur="4.53">youtubes are about the same size you did</text>
  <text start="2989.05" dur="4.59">have the benefit of the you had 43</text>
  <text start="2991.51" dur="4.38">thousand subscribers but when you say</text>
  <text start="2993.64" dur="6.27">two or three grand a month somebody like</text>
  <text start="2995.89" dur="6.66">me who is that the exact same thing even</text>

  <text start="3012.21" dur="3.72">that would rather support like okay so</text>
  <text start="3014.25" dur="4.26">let&amp;#39;s look at anti school right he was</text>
  <text start="3015.93" dur="4.14">he was really big and maydel I guess he</text>
  <text start="3018.51" dur="4.02">was making some decent cash doing this</text>
  <text start="3020.07" dur="5.549">and then he came against Q he admitted</text>
  <text start="3022.53" dur="4.35">that and he lied I mean he first he knew</text>
  <text start="3025.619" dur="2.671">about civil indictments you can look at</text>
  <text start="3026.88" dur="2.7">his old stuff and then later he denied</text>
  <text start="3028.29" dur="5.1">they even existed at one point on</text>
  <text start="3029.58" dur="5.16">Twitter but he then admitted that his</text>
  <text start="3033.39" dur="3.3">audience had abandoned him and we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="3034.74" dur="3.51">donating anymore he&amp;#39;s got a nice new</text>

  <text start="3799.609" dur="3.091">one is fascinating I think that you</text>
  <text start="3801.2" dur="3.06">should read all of those books just in</text>

  <text start="4478.989" dur="4.71">have still done the debate like that&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="4481.09" dur="5.91">can disprove uni with his own argument</text>
  <text start="4483.699" dur="5.511">so you don&amp;#39;t have to trust me Univ the</text>
  <text start="4487" dur="6.21">day after I challenged him to the debate</text>
  <text start="4489.21" dur="5.32">hosted a debate live chat on his live</text>
  <text start="4493.21" dur="3.42">stream on his chat with anti school and</text>
  <text start="4494.53" dur="4.2">said I didn&amp;#39;t show how can I not show</text>
  <text start="4496.63" dur="4.049">for a debate which obviously requires a</text>
  <text start="4498.73" dur="4.98">moderator and a date and a schedule if</text>
  <text start="4500.679" dur="5.61">there was none set well so so he said</text>
  <text start="4503.71" dur="4.77">that you came into this scored his</text>
  <text start="4506.289" dur="4.471">discord and started swearing at his</text>
  <text start="4508.48" dur="4.65">girlfriend so after I received massive</text>
  <text start="4510.76" dur="4.57">invitations from to his discord from his</text>
  <text start="4513.13" dur="3.4">followers because he won&amp;#39;t respond to me</text>
  <text start="4515.33" dur="3.06">blocked me when I asked him are we gonna</text>
  <text start="4516.53" dur="3.99">debate or not and I showed this in the</text>
  <text start="4518.39" dur="4.53">video but I guess I could still show it</text>
  <text start="4520.52" dur="3.78">because it stole my Twitter I asked him</text>
  <text start="4522.92" dur="2.7">I even asked him with Titus frost</text>
  <text start="4524.3" dur="3.24">because Titus agreed to be the moderator</text>
  <text start="4525.62" dur="3.69">and Titus is anti Q so I was like</text>
  <text start="4527.54" dur="3.12">whatever he can be the moderator at</text>
  <text start="4529.31" dur="4.44">first I suggested Jordan because I</text>
  <text start="4530.66" dur="4.47">trusted him but whatever okay take it if</text>
  <text start="4533.75" dur="5.7">they both turn on me I&amp;#39;ll just debate</text>
  <text start="4535.13" dur="7.32">them both whatever but at this point he</text>
  <text start="4539.45" dur="5.61">basically tried to just avoid me</text>
  <text start="4542.45" dur="4.74">he had his peoples convinced that I was</text>
  <text start="4545.06" dur="3.87">avoiding him it&amp;#39;s a complete projection</text>
  <text start="4547.19" dur="3.24">and gaslighting of his entire audience</text>
  <text start="4548.93" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s really dishonest and if you follow</text>
  <text start="4550.43" dur="6.42">you nirach consider that he&amp;#39;s lying to</text>
  <text start="4552.5" dur="7.29">you and then he did this every day for</text>
  <text start="4556.85" dur="5.13">multiple days I was like I challenged</text>
  <text start="4559.79" dur="3.45">them on on the third to a debate both of</text>
  <text start="4561.98" dur="2.73">them I didn&amp;#39;t really want to talk to uni</text>

  <text start="5397.419" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t remember the exact framing that it</text>
  <text start="5399.369" dur="4.141">was like so do you support he went on</text>

  <text start="5410.649" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s one man that can answer this and</text>

  <text start="5480.88" dur="5.89">we&amp;#39;re in that same t-shirt so that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="5484.49" dur="4.5">exactly evidence but our not you didn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="5647.99" dur="6.78">to make us look stupid I&amp;#39;ll call him out</text>
  <text start="5650.06" dur="7.73">too okay that&amp;#39;s fair enough</text>
  <text start="5654.77" dur="6.84">well I am gonna I&amp;#39;m gonna call this a</text>
  <text start="5657.79" dur="6.37">successful debate interview whatever you</text>
  <text start="5661.61" dur="4.38">want to call it conversation okay like I</text>
  <text start="5664.16" dur="4.71">said like this is what we need more of</text>
  <text start="5665.99" dur="8.28">just conversation not ripping at each</text>
  <text start="5668.87" dur="7.2">other&amp;#39;s throats agree so I&amp;#39;m gonna I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="5674.27" dur="4.65">gonna end the stream I want to thank</text>
  <text start="5676.07" dur="5.85">everybody misses be asked one more thing</text>
  <text start="5678.92" dur="6.02">ask about White Rabbit tip top what does</text>
  <text start="5681.92" dur="5.61">that mean anything to you so yeah okay</text>
  <text start="5684.94" dur="5.77">so this is one of the possible proofs</text>
  <text start="5687.53" dur="4.5">that I debunked myself okay and this is</text>
  <text start="5690.71" dur="2.04">after my little debate with Lee</text>
  <text start="5692.03" dur="2.67">Stranahan</text>
  <text start="5692.75" dur="4.02">because he pointed out that Trump has</text>
  <text start="5694.7" dur="5.91">actually said tippy-top in the past once</text>
  <text start="5696.77" dur="6.87">oh that okay way back in the day so in</text>
  <text start="5700.61" dur="5.43">theory q having known that Trump may say</text>
  <text start="5703.64" dur="4.14">that phrase that strange frickin phrase</text>
  <text start="5706.04" dur="5.01">that he&amp;#39;s never said but like twice in</text>
  <text start="5707.78" dur="6.06">his life that we know of in theory</text>
  <text start="5711.05" dur="5.58">he could be cold reading the crown so it</text>
  <text start="5713.84" dur="5.25">is conceivable that that cue was just</text>
  <text start="5716.63" dur="3.63">reading the crowd throwing out</text>
  <text start="5719.09" dur="3.12">there that could happen and then later</text>
  <text start="5720.26" dur="3.39">to take credit for it I don&amp;#39;t buy the</text>
  <text start="5722.21" dur="3.75">cold reading argument there&amp;#39;s way too</text>
  <text start="5723.65" dur="4.08">many coincidences at this point that</text>
  <text start="5725.96" dur="4.53">that Lee had no argument for and</text>
  <text start="5727.73" dur="4.56">wouldn&amp;#39;t address and avoided but in</text>
  <text start="5730.49" dur="4.2">theory this particular one is weaker</text>
  <text start="5732.29" dur="3.66">than the other cue proofs and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5734.69" dur="4.11">think we should include it in the list</text>
  <text start="5735.95" dur="6.3">as a full proof maybe as a possible</text>
  <text start="5738.8" dur="6.12">coincidence because was that but he did</text>
  <text start="5742.25" dur="4.74">say it next to a white rabbit that was</text>
  <text start="5744.92" dur="3.87">really suspect okay we know what white</text>
  <text start="5746.99" dur="3.57">rabbit means and we know follow the</text>
  <text start="5748.79" dur="3.24">White Rabbit and white rabbits involved</text>
  <text start="5750.56" dur="4.53">in a lot of this pedophilia symbol of</text>
  <text start="5752.03" dur="4.92">symbolism as well so we know that that</text>
  <text start="5755.09" dur="5.4">there are a lot of things that he drops</text>
  <text start="5756.95" dur="6.03">us like that their hats I know now this</text>
  <text start="5760.49" dur="4.32">brings up another thing I I&amp;#39;ve gotten</text>

  <text start="5764.81" dur="4.23">interviews and different things of</text>
  <text start="5766.07" dur="6.48">Macaulay Culkin that&amp;#39;s been the hot it</text>
  <text start="5769.04" dur="10.44">is super weird and his interview on I</text>
  <text start="5772.55" dur="9.3">think it was a Jimmy whatever it is yeah</text>
  <text start="5779.48" dur="5.88">I think it was Jimmy Fallon and he plays</text>
  <text start="5781.85" dur="5.28">in an underground band that like this</text>
  <text start="5785.36" dur="3.57">you see things are all about pizza</text>

  <text start="5788.93" dur="3.36">what the music was barely music and</text>
  <text start="5791.09" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re just basically throwing out</text>
  <text start="5792.29" dur="4.17">symbolism to buy signal I call it vice</text>
  <text start="5794.57" dur="4.32">signaling to each other Peto signaling</text>
  <text start="5796.46" dur="5.55">to each other I don&amp;#39;t know if Macaulay&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5798.89" dur="4.62">a victim or in Kaltura or what because</text>

  <text start="5803.51" dur="6.72">Macaulay Culkin on on Joe Rogan he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="5812.9" dur="4.23">up cuz he actually interrupts Joe Rogan</text>
  <text start="5815.3" dur="4.8">on the show like a lot like he&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="5817.13" dur="6.06">yeah yeah but he&amp;#39;s actually he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="5820.1" dur="6.48">funny like he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s actually if you</text>
  <text start="5823.19" dur="5.22">listen to him talk he&amp;#39;s you know Joe</text>
  <text start="5826.58" dur="3.69">Rogan said he&amp;#39;s normal I would say he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5828.41" dur="4.65">normal from a standpoint he&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="5830.27" dur="5.13">had every single person like him so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5833.06" dur="4.41">very confident you know everybody says</text>

  <text start="5855.26" dur="5.13">outside of the context of pedophilia</text>
  <text start="5857.95" dur="5.86">exactly I don&amp;#39;t know he&amp;#39;s a victim or an</text>
  <text start="5860.39" dur="4.77">MK ULTRA or if he&amp;#39;s a perpetrator or if</text>
  <text start="5863.81" dur="3.48">they just set him up to do it because</text>

  <text start="6001.54" dur="3.03">least that control levels are involved</text>
  <text start="6003.16" dur="3.78">in this stuff you cannot go to the</text>
  <text start="6004.57" dur="4.17">system and in my opinion as a voluntary</text>
  <text start="6006.94" dur="4.35">US trust in the system is what got us to</text>
  <text start="6008.74" dur="4.95">this problem used people trusting the</text>
  <text start="6011.29" dur="5.55">system and trusting authority and</text>
  <text start="6013.69" dur="4.92">abdicating their responsibility is what</text>
  <text start="6016.84" dur="3.69">got us into this in the first place if</text>

  <text start="6020.53" dur="5.25">your moral decisions and to take care of</text>
  <text start="6022.27" dur="5.52">the world then when goes bad</text>

  <text start="6027.79" dur="3.54">did a bad job and they abused power of</text>
  <text start="6029.68" dur="4.5">course because power always gets abused</text>
  <text start="6031.33" dur="5.37">power corrupts and we know that then you</text>
  <text start="6034.18" dur="4.29">know what&amp;#39;s the surprise of course the</text>
  <text start="6036.7" dur="3.87">system will be co-opted at some point</text>
  <text start="6038.47" dur="3.87">they haven&amp;#39;t they have concentrated with</text>

  <text start="6655.629" dur="3.09">things and it just completely fried my</text>
  <text start="6657.039" dur="8.721">brain I don&amp;#39;t know I was shocked I don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="6676.329" dur="4.26">yeah perfect the arguments for that so</text>
  <text start="6677.949" dur="4.11">one when they start actually censoring</text>
  <text start="6680.589" dur="3.03">and controlling what people say there</text>
  <text start="6682.059" dur="3.721">are now a publisher rather than a</text>
  <text start="6683.619" dur="3.72">whatever it is they are now which which</text>
  <text start="6685.78" dur="3.059">sets them up to be held accountable for</text>
  <text start="6687.339" dur="2.97">anything on their profile like if</text>
  <text start="6688.839" dur="3.211">someone puts porn on YouTube they can</text>
  <text start="6690.309" dur="3.18">now be sued for that through this</text>
  <text start="6692.05" dur="4.829">because now they&amp;#39;re a publisher or</text>
  <text start="6693.489" dur="5.16">whatever it is so by by controlling what</text>
  <text start="6696.879" dur="4.921">people say they&amp;#39;re responsible for what</text>
  <text start="6698.649" dur="5.52">people say - we have a justice Sotomayor</text>
  <text start="6701.8" dur="4.109">who said that if you and this is I think</text>
  <text start="6704.169" dur="3.78">a Supreme Court decision if you serve</text>
  <text start="6705.909" dur="3.42">the public square you have to serve the</text>
  <text start="6707.949" dur="3.69">entire public square and this is the</text>
  <text start="6709.329" dur="3.6">public square and three we another</text>
  <text start="6711.639" dur="3.15">option is the Internet Bill of Rights</text>
  <text start="6712.929" dur="3.84">and that would prevent them from doing a</text>
  <text start="6714.789" dur="3.21">lot of this and for the best option</text>
  <text start="6716.769" dur="2.79">which we don&amp;#39;t have to trust any</text>
  <text start="6717.999" dur="2.52">government with or anything or go</text>
