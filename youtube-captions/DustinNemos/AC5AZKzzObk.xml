  <text start="20.939" dur="3.481">believe in cue you know my argument has</text>
  <text start="22.65" dur="2.94">always been look a lot of people believe</text>
  <text start="24.42" dur="3.51">this a lot of people are gonna be</text>
  <text start="25.59" dur="4.05">influenced by this it may pay to know</text>
  <text start="27.93" dur="4.05">what&amp;#39;s being talked about right even if</text>
  <text start="29.64" dur="4.53">you don&amp;#39;t agree with it it&amp;#39;s always good</text>
  <text start="31.98" dur="4.29">to know what people are thinking and</text>
  <text start="34.17" dur="5.49">that that kind of numbers I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="36.27" dur="5.16">seeing a lot of the population excuse me</text>
  <text start="39.66" dur="5.91">a lot of the population go into the cue</text>
  <text start="41.43" dur="5.85">thing right we&amp;#39;ve seen no one attacked</text>
  <text start="45.57" dur="3.63">more than cue and on except Trump</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="5.79">himself so he&amp;#39;s number two behind Trump</text>
  <text start="49.2" dur="5.519">as attacks we&amp;#39;ve seen even the MSM admit</text>
  <text start="53.07" dur="5.03">that he&amp;#39;s one of the most influential or</text>
  <text start="54.719" dur="7.441">the team really the most influential</text>
  <text start="58.1" dur="6.19">people out there so to speak so I want</text>
  <text start="62.16" dur="4.02">to go into this one post because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="64.29" dur="3.99">very interesting what could happen if</text>
  <text start="66.18" dur="5.16">this is true or I don&amp;#39;t know what the</text>
  <text start="68.28" dur="6.72">true timeline of this is gonna be so who</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="5.279">knows how drastic or traumatic but in</text>
  <text start="75" dur="3.659">the current paradigm in the current way</text>
  <text start="76.619" dur="3.871">of thinking and maybe I&amp;#39;ll look back one</text>
  <text start="78.659" dur="4.5">day and think oh man things have changed</text>
  <text start="80.49" dur="4.739">so much it&amp;#39;s great but in the current</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="4.951">thinking going to a gold standard just</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="6.301">sounds completely impossible okay it</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="5.549">sounds crazy now on the other hand there</text>
  <text start="91.53" dur="5.1">is a lot of buried gold in places like</text>
  <text start="93.659" dur="4.32">the Grand Canyon and such that the</text>
  <text start="96.63" dur="4.22">average person doesn&amp;#39;t really take into</text>
  <text start="97.979" dur="5.551">account so there is the potential for</text>
  <text start="100.85" dur="6.25">ramping up production and using gold as</text>
  <text start="103.53" dur="7.229">money coinage things like that it is</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="5.4">possible but it would destroy the</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="3.93">Federal Reserve System and by extension</text>
  <text start="112.5" dur="4.799">it would destroy a lot of the corruption</text>
  <text start="114.689" dur="4.051">and then by extension it would set such</text>
  <text start="117.299" dur="3.951">an example for the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="4.71">that they would then do the same thing</text>
  <text start="121.25" dur="4.479">because I don&amp;#39;t I truly don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="123.45" dur="6.21">that fiat currencies can exist outside</text>
  <text start="125.729" dur="7.09">of a totalitarian dictatorship of a</text>
  <text start="129.66" dur="5.35">North Korean type</text>
  <text start="132.819" dur="4.441">while there is an example of a sound</text>
  <text start="135.01" dur="6.089">currency out there that that is that is</text>
  <text start="137.26" dur="6.809">doing well like not long-term I mean</text>
  <text start="141.099" dur="5.491">just the benefits that are gonna go with</text>
  <text start="144.069" dur="5.221">having a real money a sound currency or</text>
  <text start="146.59" dur="4.769">gonna be so dramatic that other nations</text>
  <text start="149.29" dur="6.599">are going to demand it as well just my</text>
  <text start="151.359" dur="7.291">opinion so if if he was correct and this</text>
  <text start="155.889" dur="6.481">anon was asking him one of his recent q</text>
  <text start="158.65" dur="6.39">A&amp;#39;s yeah Hughes giving a Q&amp;amp;A that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.37" dur="5.099">funny to me but he said do we have the</text>
  <text start="165.04" dur="4.47">gold and it&amp;#39;s always been my position we</text>
  <text start="167.469" dur="3.42">don&amp;#39;t really have that much now except</text>
  <text start="169.51" dur="6.24">what&amp;#39;s in the ground of course we have</text>
  <text start="170.889" dur="6.66">some some big reserves but Hugh says yes</text>
  <text start="175.75" dur="5.93">we do have the gold and in fact he says</text>
  <text start="177.549" dur="6.27">that gold shall destroy the Fed so</text>
  <text start="181.68" dur="4.33">intriguing possibilities right</text>
  <text start="183.819" dur="4.35">especially if you do buy into the Q</text>
  <text start="186.01" dur="3.72">thing and you&amp;#39;ve seen as much of the</text>
  <text start="188.169" dur="5.011">evidence as I have at this point I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="189.73" dur="5.099">a believer type at all by any means I if</text>
  <text start="193.18" dur="5.61">anything have an investment background</text>
  <text start="194.829" dur="5.671">and mindset however I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot at</text>
  <text start="198.79" dur="4.379">this point to think that this guy has</text>
  <text start="200.5" dur="5.759">Trump&amp;#39;s ear so whatever you want to</text>
  <text start="203.169" dur="6.481">believe either way we see things ramping</text>
  <text start="206.259" dur="5.22">up between Trump and the Fed and we see</text>
  <text start="209.65" dur="4.079">the economy getting more volatile and</text>
  <text start="211.479" dur="6.361">more erratic and these two narratives</text>
  <text start="213.729" dur="8.311">are are coming to a full battle at this</text>
  <text start="217.84" dur="6.569">point so time will tell it could be soon</text>
  <text start="222.04" dur="5.099">though it could be soon it could be very</text>
  <text start="224.409" dur="5.72">soon if if Trump is able to successfully</text>
  <text start="227.139" dur="7.02">shift the blame for the coming economic</text>
  <text start="230.129" dur="6.551">catastrophe to the Fed rather than</text>
  <text start="234.159" dur="4.32">himself no it&amp;#39;s gonna be tricky because</text>
  <text start="236.68" dur="4.38">he has claimed credit for all the good</text>
  <text start="238.479" dur="4.111">stuff but then they did just jack</text>
  <text start="241.06" dur="3.149">interest rates a few times so it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="242.59" dur="4.319">be easy to point the blame at them we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="244.209" dur="4.83">see what happens with that I would love</text>
  <text start="246.909" dur="2.58">to get your opinions on this particular</text>
  <text start="249.039" dur="3.72">topic</text>
  <text start="249.489" dur="6.12">in the comments below I&amp;#39;m always looking</text>
  <text start="252.759" dur="8.311">for other opinions too are you saying</text>
  <text start="255.609" dur="8.051">Baba are you saying bye-bye amen</text>
  <text start="261.07" dur="6.31">you miss being in the camera don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="263.66" dur="7.62">your camera baby okay</text>
  <text start="267.38" dur="6.539">this is my daughter Athena anyway so I I</text>
  <text start="271.28" dur="5.28">always really enjoy seeing other</text>
  <text start="273.919" dur="4.411">perspectives other things that I may not</text>
  <text start="276.56" dur="4.59">have taken into consideration when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="278.33" dur="6.089">looking into especially economic and</text>
  <text start="281.15" dur="5.76">investment things like I&amp;#39;m you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="284.419" dur="5.161">obviously I&amp;#39;m very big on precious</text>
  <text start="286.91" dur="5.64">metals especially silver far more so</text>
  <text start="289.58" dur="5.339">than far more so than gold because the</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="4.29">fundamentals are just much you&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="294.919" dur="3.571">aren&amp;#39;t you trying to grab my water the</text>
  <text start="296.84" dur="4.53">fundamentals are just way better in</text>
  <text start="298.49" dur="7.38">silver and the ratio is just off the</text>
  <text start="301.37" dur="7.56">charts in source favor right now so if</text>
  <text start="305.87" dur="7.56">there&amp;#39;s a reset if there&amp;#39;s a big you</text>
  <text start="308.93" dur="8.37">know change in the system that weird</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="6.54">thing yeah someone gave me this at the</text>
  <text start="317.3" dur="5.46">conference it&amp;#39;s a product their son</text>
  <text start="319.97" dur="5.43">makes it&amp;#39;s really neat it&amp;#39;s a chapstick</text>
  <text start="322.76" dur="5.07">but it&amp;#39;s shaped like a black skull</text>
  <text start="325.4" dur="5.01">plastic skull it&amp;#39;s kind of weird anyway</text>
  <text start="327.83" dur="4.23">so I think that&amp;#39;s all I really wanted to</text>
  <text start="330.41" dur="4.2">say at this point like this is just an</text>
  <text start="332.06" dur="3.9">intriguing concept you could have the</text>
  <text start="334.61" dur="3.84">ear of the President of the United</text>
  <text start="335.96" dur="4.35">States of America I believe that he does</text>
  <text start="338.45" dur="3.75">I think that you know I&amp;#39;ve done some</text>
  <text start="340.31" dur="3.39">proof videos and them in the past and I</text>
  <text start="342.2" dur="3.96">think that if you just go to cue proofs</text>
  <text start="343.7" dur="4.71">calm and and you know peruse through</text>
  <text start="346.16" dur="4.379">you&amp;#39;ll see some weird coincidence is</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="4.41">that that just you know strain credulity</text>
  <text start="350.539" dur="6.681">a little bit so I&amp;#39;ll see you guys on the</text>
  <text start="352.82" dur="4.4">next one and this is destiny most out</text>
