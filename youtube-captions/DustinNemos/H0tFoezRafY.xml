  <text start="233.91" dur="3.66">the system a little bit different so</text>
  <text start="235.35" dur="3.66">that they have all of the access keys</text>
  <text start="237.57" dur="3.06">they have all of the back doors to</text>
  <text start="239.01" dur="4.08">everything they have all of the software</text>
  <text start="240.63" dur="4.86">all the patents they know it all whereas</text>
  <text start="243.09" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re in this other world where we think</text>
  <text start="245.49" dur="4.71">people respect these things and our</text>
  <text start="247.05" dur="5.04">privacy is private and it&amp;#39;s not the case</text>

  <text start="255.63" dur="4.95">conversations where no one&amp;#39;s around to</text>
  <text start="257.76" dur="4.65">to laser off of I collect you know you</text>
  <text start="260.58" dur="3.15">can laser off of a glass of window and</text>
  <text start="262.41" dur="3.06">see what people are seeing in that room</text>
  <text start="263.73" dur="5.79">and you can make these devices at home</text>
  <text start="265.47" dur="7.77">you could you could go and build a a CIA</text>
  <text start="269.52" dur="5.88">kind of laser detector machine I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="4.74">know what they call these things it</text>
  <text start="275.4" dur="4.26">bounce it off a window in DC and learn</text>
  <text start="277.98" dur="3.36">what the people inside of that room are</text>
  <text start="279.66" dur="3.27">saying in real time you could have the</text>
  <text start="281.34" dur="3.81">whole conversation in your ears much</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="4.56">like you know the earphones on my head</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s illegal as how I&amp;#39;m sure don&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="287.49" dur="4.59">and don&amp;#39;t start looking up how to do it</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="6.45">but know that it is possible so of</text>
  <text start="292.08" dur="4.44">course Hugh said publicly known hmm it</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="4.74">is now right</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="5.69">think non-public access granted so of</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="4.56">course the backdoors he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="4.92">and Hilary&amp;#39;s one of them you know the</text>
  <text start="304.86" dur="5.46">clowns the CIA they have the back doors</text>
  <text start="307.13" dur="5.05">so I never actually try to be that</text>
  <text start="310.32" dur="4.38">private myself and and maybe that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="312.18" dur="4.53">mistake I I still use Gmail sometimes</text>
  <text start="314.7" dur="3.54">and I&amp;#39;m shifting away from that because</text>
  <text start="316.71" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re starting to ban even</text>
  <text start="318.24" dur="5.04">Gmail accounts but frankly I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="321.33" dur="4.68">expect to maintain privacy from Google</text>
  <text start="323.28" dur="4.56">or the NSA or the CIA I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="326.01" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;m that good with technology to be able</text>
  <text start="327.84" dur="6.63">to do so probably most of you out there</text>
  <text start="330.15" dur="6.45">or not also and look that&amp;#39;s just how it</text>
  <text start="334.47" dur="4.32">is I don&amp;#39;t say secrets online I don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="338.79" dur="4.14">keep I wouldn&amp;#39;t say them online because</text>
  <text start="340.74" dur="3.39">I already understand there is no privacy</text>

  <text start="482.72" dur="5.27">on because that was his original mandate</text>
  <text start="484.82" dur="6.24">for us was to break the fake news and is</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="5.44">it&amp;#39;s crazy wild to see that image spread</text>
  <text start="491.06" dur="5.01">throughout the internet everywhere and</text>
  <text start="493.43" dur="4.289">and so much has happened since all right</text>
  <text start="496.07" dur="3.809">so that one is a pretty soon</text>
  <text start="497.719" dur="3.26">full queue post I think just bragging a</text>
  <text start="499.879" dur="6.03">little bit about how much we&amp;#39;ve grown</text>
  <text start="500.979" dur="7.03">now we&amp;#39;re going to move to 36 23 and the</text>
  <text start="505.909" dur="4.86">corrupt system has been ripping off the</text>
  <text start="508.009" dur="6.95">US taxpayer all right let&amp;#39;s check it out</text>
  <text start="510.769" dur="4.19">there&amp;#39;s a YouTube video 16-minute mark</text>
  <text start="519.58" dur="5.21">that&amp;#39;s what he said now with all of that</text>
  <text start="522.34" dur="4.62">of course you have to look at at</text>
  <text start="524.79" dur="5.11">corruption are we going to be sending</text>
  <text start="526.96" dur="4.62">massive amounts of money to a country</text>
  <text start="529.9" dur="3.06">and they&amp;#39;re corrupt and they steal the</text>
  <text start="531.58" dur="3.63">money and that goes into everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.96" dur="4.17">bank account so you have to look at that</text>
  <text start="535.21" dur="5.13">and I will tell you this about Joe Biden</text>
  <text start="537.13" dur="6.45">I never I never said it specifically on</text>
  <text start="540.34" dur="5.43">him but I watched Joe Biden with the</text>
  <text start="543.58" dur="3.93">prosecutor who a lot of people said was</text>
  <text start="545.77" dur="5.19">a great prosecutor and they took him off</text>
  <text start="547.51" dur="6.51">and he was prosecuting that company and</text>
  <text start="550.96" dur="5.01">the kid who never made ten cents in his</text>
  <text start="554.02" dur="4.92">life and all of a sudden is making</text>
  <text start="555.97" dur="5.43">millions of dollars today he I mean you</text>
  <text start="558.94" dur="5.22">tell me this is a guy who got thrown out</text>
  <text start="561.4" dur="5.31">of the Navy dishonorably but gets thrown</text>
  <text start="564.16" dur="4.92">out of the Navy shortly there and made</text>
  <text start="566.71" dur="6.78">no money went through made no money for</text>
  <text start="569.08" dur="6.3">mr. VP at he&amp;#39;s making millions and</text>
  <text start="573.49" dur="2.85">millions of dollars not only from there</text>
  <text start="575.38" dur="4.2">but China</text>
  <text start="576.34" dur="7.17">so mr. president the accusation is this</text>
  <text start="579.58" dur="7.2">that you&amp;#39;re using ade taxpayer dollars</text>
  <text start="583.51" dur="7.02">to attack a political opponent in Joe</text>
  <text start="586.78" dur="5.52">Biden and you say you do it say I wanted</text>
  <text start="590.53" dur="4.13">to hold up that a because of corruption</text>
  <text start="592.3" dur="5.46">but you also have a phone call to do</text>
  <text start="594.66" dur="4.75">reason ok for corruption because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="597.76" dur="4.26">known I want to make sure the money is</text>
  <text start="599.41" dur="5.01">gonna be spent properly but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="602.02" dur="4.23">another reason that is maybe to me the</text>
  <text start="604.42" dur="4.77">most important which is why is in</text>
  <text start="606.25" dur="5.13">Germany France the European Union why</text>
  <text start="609.19" dur="4.23">aren&amp;#39;t all those countries in Europe why</text>
  <text start="611.38" dur="4.92">aren&amp;#39;t they paying why is it always the</text>
  <text start="613.42" dur="5.85">United States to sucker I got elected on</text>
  <text start="616.3" dur="5.31">that but they do give aid they do give</text>
