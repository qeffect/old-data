  <text start="328.65" dur="3.81">basically shipping them out like that I</text>
  <text start="330.84" dur="3.45">wonder if the rest of the country</text>
  <text start="332.46" dur="4.47">decided to ship their homeless to New</text>
  <text start="334.29" dur="4.62">York what would happen because I think</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="4.29">that would be a great way to sort of</text>
  <text start="338.91" dur="4.68">solve the rest of the country&amp;#39;s problems</text>
  <text start="341.22" dur="4.41">I mean homelessness isn&amp;#39;t as big of a</text>
  <text start="343.59" dur="3.45">deal there obviously they are they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345.63" dur="4.62">experts of handling it in both</text>
  <text start="347.04" dur="5.13">California and New York City so the same</text>
  <text start="350.25" dur="3.45">thing with the sanctuary cities let&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="358.17" dur="3.63">mountain of public it&amp;#39;s beautiful and</text>
  <text start="359.88" dur="4.5">and and not really I&amp;#39;m being sarcastic</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="4.23">here so that people don&amp;#39;t get crazy but</text>
  <text start="364.38" dur="3.84">you know and if as long as you can avoid</text>
  <text start="366.03" dur="3.36">the rats the typhus the Black Plague and</text>

  <text start="386.59" dur="3.509">homeless for for things outside of their</text>
  <text start="388.539" dur="4.171">control but for the most part it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.099" dur="4.47">because they&amp;#39;re drug addicts and I say</text>
  <text start="392.71" dur="4.679">this is someone&amp;#39;s have quite a bit of</text>
  <text start="394.569" dur="4.291">experience with my own family with them</text>

  <text start="419.139" dur="6.301">illness addiction or despair and that is</text>
  <text start="423.34" dur="6.15">something that that can&amp;#39;t necessarily be</text>
  <text start="425.44" dur="5.67">solved by throwing money at it or or</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="3.299">trying to help them you have to either</text>

  <text start="454.449" dur="4.111">position where she she lost part of her</text>
  <text start="456.46" dur="5.19">mind now this was compounded with a</text>
  <text start="458.56" dur="5.28">brain injury but at one point she was</text>
  <text start="461.65" dur="3.9">going door to door naked to try to sleep</text>

  <text start="485.71" dur="4.5">illness I wish there was a better</text>
  <text start="488.05" dur="3.959">solution for those folks in fact I wish</text>
  <text start="490.21" dur="4.109">that some of those mentally ill folks</text>
  <text start="492.009" dur="4.77">had a way to get a job because of</text>
  <text start="494.319" dur="4.021">minimum laws a minimum wage laws which</text>
  <text start="496.779" dur="4.23">are meant to help but really only hurt</text>
  <text start="498.34" dur="4.859">the lowest income earners among us the</text>
  <text start="501.009" dur="4.53">people have the least skills people that</text>
  <text start="503.199" dur="4.411">maybe are mentally ill could have some</text>
  <text start="505.539" dur="4.021">form of functioning income in some</text>
  <text start="507.61" dur="4.14">limited capacity maybe two or three</text>
  <text start="509.56" dur="3.87">bucks an hour they&amp;#39;re not gonna live</text>
  <text start="511.75" dur="3">well but they wouldn&amp;#39;t be starving on</text>
  <text start="513.43" dur="2.58">the street</text>
  <text start="514.75" dur="3.18">is what happens when you start getting</text>
  <text start="516.01" dur="3.839">government intervention ISM you know you</text>
  <text start="517.93" dur="3.479">start getting them the let&amp;#39;s have</text>
  <text start="519.849" dur="3.601">minimum wages because people are</text>
  <text start="521.409" dur="4.531">suffering in their broke okay well</text>
  <text start="523.45" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s fine but you can&amp;#39;t mandate value</text>
  <text start="525.94" dur="3.9">you can&amp;#39;t say that that person suddenly</text>
  <text start="528.04" dur="3.6">worth fifteen or twenty or a hundred</text>
  <text start="529.84" dur="5.04">dollars an hour you have to actually</text>
  <text start="531.64" dur="5.43">work within the laws of reality and if</text>
  <text start="534.88" dur="4.41">they can give three dollars an hour and</text>
  <text start="537.07" dur="3.9">they can have some pride in their work</text>
  <text start="539.29" dur="4.2">and they can actually build some maybe</text>
  <text start="540.97" dur="4.53">some experience and go up from there or</text>
  <text start="543.49" dur="4.47">something at least they can contribute</text>
  <text start="545.5" dur="3.96">and feel like members of society instead</text>
  <text start="547.96" dur="4.77">of falling off and falling into the</text>
  <text start="549.46" dur="5.61">woods or the parks and the drugs and the</text>
  <text start="552.73" dur="5.13">despair right so this is a very</text>
  <text start="555.07" dur="5.03">complicated situation I don&amp;#39;t say any of</text>
  <text start="557.86" dur="4.95">these things with without sympathy</text>
  <text start="560.1" dur="4.45">however I do think that it would be</text>
  <text start="562.81" dur="4.29">hilarious if everyone began to ship</text>
  <text start="564.55" dur="5.67">their homes to New York I think that</text>
  <text start="567.1" dur="5.13">would be sort of a exact reversal of</text>
  <text start="570.22" dur="3.66">what&amp;#39;s happening here and I think it</text>
  <text start="572.23" dur="3.54">would teach them to stop that crap keep</text>
  <text start="573.88" dur="5.34">your problems to yourself and solve your</text>
  <text start="575.77" dur="5.88">problems don&amp;#39;t keep exporting nothing</text>
  <text start="579.22" dur="5.46">but problems and vices</text>
  <text start="581.65" dur="5.07">and corruption and bad culture from</text>
  <text start="584.68" dur="4.32">these liberal households to the rest of</text>
  <text start="586.72" dur="6.09">the world you know Texas is nearly</text>
  <text start="589" dur="5.43">fallen under because of the the I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="592.81" dur="3.27">know what you call it Cal exit or</text>
  <text start="594.43" dur="3.06">whatever from California all the</text>
  <text start="596.08" dur="3.12">Liberals are leaving and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="705.75" dur="3.99">they were talking about why didn&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="707.31" dur="4.56">give the information to Adam Schiff and</text>
  <text start="709.74" dur="3.75">his committee and the answer is because</text>
  <text start="711.87" dur="3.99">I think Adam Schiff is the biggest</text>
  <text start="713.49" dur="4.14">leaker in Washington you know that I</text>
  <text start="715.86" dur="3.84">know that we all know that I&amp;#39;ve watched</text>

  <text start="722.22" dur="4.559">ever seen before</text>
  <text start="724.26" dur="5.19">we had a very good conversation with the</text>
  <text start="726.779" dur="4.56">Ukrainian president the conversation was</text>
  <text start="729.45" dur="4.44">was perfect they don&amp;#39;t ever talk about</text>
  <text start="731.339" dur="4.171">the conversation it started with a</text>
  <text start="733.89" dur="3.629">whistleblower now they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="735.51" dur="3.78">whistleblower then they had a second</text>
  <text start="737.519" dur="4.231">whistleblower now they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="739.29" dur="4.83">second whistleblower the reason is that</text>
  <text start="741.75" dur="4.44">when the whistleblower when they saw</text>
  <text start="744.12" dur="4.56">what the whistleblower wrote and then</text>
  <text start="746.19" dur="4.709">when I released the conversation which</text>
  <text start="748.68" dur="4.62">for no relationship to what the whistle</text>
  <text start="750.899" dur="4.44">blows are they said their case was out</text>
  <text start="753.3" dur="5.07">the window and I think it&amp;#39;s a disgrace</text>
  <text start="755.339" dur="4.921">and frankly I told Republicans who are</text>
  <text start="758.37" dur="4.709">really being taken advantage of they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="760.26" dur="5.009">really being maligned and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="763.079" dur="4.681">it&amp;#39;s a horrible thing they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="765.269" dur="4.801">looking to hurt the Republican Party and</text>
  <text start="767.76" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s turning out to be just the opposite</text>
  <text start="770.07" dur="4.86">so one thing I said I&amp;#39;d rather go into</text>
  <text start="772.98" dur="5.07">the details of the case rather than</text>
  <text start="774.93" dur="5.159">process process is wonderful we already</text>
  <text start="778.05" dur="5.52">have 50 Republican senators I never</text>
  <text start="780.089" dur="6.12">called one of them sign up 50 out of 50</text>
  <text start="783.57" dur="5.79">350 and perhaps the other ones will do</text>
  <text start="786.209" dur="4.681">it do but process is good but I think</text>
  <text start="789.36" dur="3.78">you ought to look at the case and the</text>
  <text start="790.89" dur="5.61">case is very simple its quick it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="793.14" dur="5.49">quick I had a great conversation with</text>
  <text start="796.5" dur="4.199">the Ukrainian president I had another</text>
  <text start="798.63" dur="5.34">conversation with him also I think</text>
  <text start="800.699" dur="5.671">before that which was the same thing it</text>
  <text start="803.97" dur="4.679">was nothing they tried to take that</text>
  <text start="806.37" dur="4.829">conversation and make it into a big</text>
  <text start="808.649" dur="4.321">scandal the problem was we had it</text>
  <text start="811.199" dur="5.061">transcribed it was an exact</text>
  <text start="812.97" dur="7.46">transcription of the conversation so in</text>
  <text start="816.26" dur="6.51">a whistleblower wrote a false narrative</text>
  <text start="820.43" dur="4.44">of the conversation now they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="822.77" dur="4.05">to talk about the whistleblower because</text>
  <text start="824.87" dur="4.47">they didn&amp;#39;t think I was going to release</text>
  <text start="826.82" dur="5.82">the conversation when I released the</text>
  <text start="829.34" dur="7.23">conversation I blew up shifts act and</text>
  <text start="832.64" dur="5.97">just to put topping on it the Russian as</text>
  <text start="836.57" dur="5.16">you know the new Russian president a</text>
  <text start="838.61" dur="5.43">good man made his statement there was no</text>
  <text start="841.73" dur="2.82">anything there was no pressure put on</text>
  <text start="844.04" dur="4.2">him</text>
  <text start="844.55" dur="5.85">no anything the Foreign Minister of</text>
  <text start="848.24" dur="4.86">Ukraine made this statement there was</text>
  <text start="850.4" dur="3.9">absolutely no pressure put on they</text>
  <text start="853.1" dur="4.5">didn&amp;#39;t even know what we were talking</text>
  <text start="854.3" dur="5.91">about and just to finish it off Adam</text>

  <text start="860.21" dur="5.1">made up my words he didn&amp;#39;t copy what I</text>
  <text start="863.51" dur="4.56">said he didn&amp;#39;t know him probably at the</text>
  <text start="865.31" dur="5.22">time nobody thought I was going to</text>
  <text start="868.07" dur="4.02">release the conversation I got the</text>
  <text start="870.53" dur="4.17">approval from Ukraine</text>
  <text start="872.09" dur="4.53">once I released the conversation this</text>
  <text start="874.7" dur="3.9">thing all died and that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="876.62" dur="4.56">should be looking and Adam Schiff went</text>
  <text start="878.6" dur="6">before Congress and Adam Schiff what he</text>
  <text start="881.18" dur="5.48">did will never be forgotten he made up a</text>
  <text start="884.6" dur="4.71">conversation that was a phony</text>
  <text start="886.66" dur="4.21">fabrication it was a fraud and people</text>
  <text start="889.31" dur="4.08">shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to get away they</text>
  <text start="890.87" dur="4.62">say he has immunity because he&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="895.49" dur="4.29">allowed to do that that&amp;#39;s a criminal act</text>
