  <text start="61.05" dur="3.21">opinion he may go down as one of the</text>
  <text start="62.789" dur="3.231">world&amp;#39;s greatest philosophers but they</text>
  <text start="64.26" dur="5.1">never are appreciated until they&amp;#39;re dead</text>
  <text start="66.02" dur="5.08">unfortunately but just in terms of reach</text>
  <text start="69.36" dur="3.6">and bringing people to the concepts of</text>
  <text start="71.1" dur="4.92">philosophy I think he&amp;#39;s having a far</text>
  <text start="72.96" dur="4.89">greater impact then than most still</text>
  <text start="76.02" dur="4.73">living philosophers ever have before</text>
  <text start="77.85" dur="4.8">he&amp;#39;s reached half a billion people so</text>

  <text start="86.159" dur="4.591">where I get a lot of a lot of that from</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="4.55">I get the term not an argument I</text>
  <text start="90.75" dur="5.579">actually got that from him so I use that</text>
  <text start="92.93" dur="4.63">liberally not because I want to because</text>
  <text start="96.329" dur="3.9">they don&amp;#39;t have arguments and they use</text>
  <text start="97.56" dur="6.33">insults or they call you her mother at</text>

  <text start="115.77" dur="4.02">Africa this is absolutely true if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="5.461">following I highly recommend the</text>
  <text start="119.79" dur="6.689">documentary by Lauren southern about</text>
  <text start="123.54" dur="4.859">South African issue because we&amp;#39;re at a</text>
  <text start="126.479" dur="4.551">situation now where the the socialist</text>
  <text start="128.399" dur="7.521">government basically is willing to</text>
  <text start="131.03" dur="6.63">declared war on white farmer white South</text>
  <text start="135.92" dur="6.42">African farmers and just take their land</text>
  <text start="137.66" dur="6.51">kill them everything else the thing</text>
  <text start="142.34" dur="3.21">about this is is that many of them you</text>
  <text start="144.17" dur="2.58">know they have his they have history</text>
  <text start="145.55" dur="2.67">their they have legacy there they were</text>
  <text start="146.75" dur="3.36">Dutch settlers before many of the blacks</text>
  <text start="148.22" dur="3.3">were even in that area they were not</text>
  <text start="150.11" dur="4.98">conquerors or colonialists as they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="151.52" dur="4.95">trying to be to be branded as but</text>
  <text start="155.09" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;ve done well for themselves as</text>
  <text start="156.47" dur="3.09">farmers you know and they&amp;#39;re scattered</text>
  <text start="158.3" dur="2.66">out there and terrible things are</text>
  <text start="159.56" dur="3.48">happening to them they&amp;#39;ve had children</text>
  <text start="160.96" dur="5.26">nailed to tables and raped to death</text>
  <text start="163.04" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;ve had children boiled alive in in</text>
  <text start="166.22" dur="5.04">bathtubs and then people had to scrape</text>
  <text start="168.17" dur="6.09">the skin off the tub later this is the</text>
  <text start="171.26" dur="5.28">kind of things that are going on from</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="4.59">all of the whipping up of hatred in a</text>
  <text start="176.54" dur="6.27">vastly outnumbered situation where there</text>
  <text start="178.85" dur="6.09">are way more I guess blacks in this case</text>
  <text start="182.81" dur="4.8">but way more minorities and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="184.94" dur="4.2">lot of anti white hatred so you know it</text>
  <text start="187.61" dur="3.599">can happen in this country as well if we</text>
  <text start="189.14" dur="3.69">were to ever get outnumbered by you know</text>
  <text start="191.209" dur="3.661">tons and tons and tons of illegal</text>
  <text start="192.83" dur="5.07">immigrants or other cultures yes</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="5.55">absolutely it would become violent and</text>
  <text start="197.9" dur="5.82">and socialists are very good at whipping</text>
  <text start="200.42" dur="6.44">up violence against the the haves by the</text>
  <text start="203.72" dur="5.79">haves and have-nots there is definitely</text>
  <text start="206.86" dur="5.74">his historical precedence because we</text>
  <text start="209.51" dur="5.13">have the the cool acts in Russia Soviet</text>
  <text start="212.6" dur="3.33">Russia basically locked them all up to</text>
  <text start="214.64" dur="6.18">fair land as well and then there was</text>
  <text start="215.93" dur="6.93">mass starvation in the gulags so this is</text>
  <text start="220.82" dur="3.69">a scary situation I hope that they will</text>
  <text start="222.86" dur="3.9">leave I hope that they will save their</text>
  <text start="224.51" dur="4.5">their lives and their legacy rather than</text>
  <text start="226.76" dur="3.78">their heritage and their land because</text>
  <text start="229.01" dur="3.42">that is the choices coming down to now</text>
  <text start="230.54" dur="5.669">to be fair they have one of the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.43" dur="5.339">largest non-military non-government well</text>
  <text start="236.209" dur="3.331">non-government military forces I mean</text>
  <text start="237.769" dur="3.091">it&amp;#39;s basically a paramilitary force they</text>
  <text start="239.54" dur="3.66">have their own civil defense force</text>
  <text start="240.86" dur="4.25">they&amp;#39;re very well armed they&amp;#39;re vastly</text>
  <text start="243.2" dur="7.92">outnumbered and they&amp;#39;re scattered so</text>
  <text start="245.11" dur="6.849">it&amp;#39;s not a it&amp;#39;s not a it&amp;#39;s not a fight a</text>
  <text start="251.12" dur="3.119">firefight</text>
  <text start="251.959" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s a they&amp;#39;re getting picked off one at</text>
  <text start="254.239" dur="5.881">a time in their homes fight and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="4.261">it&amp;#39;s disturbing now there is a guy named</text>
  <text start="260.12" dur="3.15">Cody Wilson okay</text>
  <text start="261.47" dur="3.87">of defense distributed who is spreading</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="4.5">the blueprints I think he&amp;#39;s doing it for</text>
  <text start="265.34" dur="4.23">free online to make your own 3d printed</text>
  <text start="267.77" dur="3">guns at home with no serial numbers no</text>
  <text start="269.57" dur="2.97">tracking government doesn&amp;#39;t have to know</text>
  <text start="270.77" dur="3.45">about it which i think is legal if you</text>
  <text start="272.54" dur="5.97">do it for yourself and you own it you</text>
  <text start="274.22" dur="6.09">don&amp;#39;t sell it that said the point is and</text>
  <text start="278.51" dur="2.94">he did win a lawsuit recently to be able</text>
  <text start="280.31" dur="3.6">to do this again because they tried to</text>
  <text start="281.45" dur="4.35">block him but the point here is that gun</text>
  <text start="283.91" dur="3.6">control is not a possibility not only</text>
  <text start="285.8" dur="4.2">does it not work and end up with you</text>
  <text start="287.51" dur="5.16">know like chicago-style deaths which is</text>
  <text start="290" dur="4.44">basically a Vegas every month but you</text>
  <text start="292.67" dur="3.57">know it&amp;#39;s not possible even if you</text>
  <text start="294.44" dur="4.32">believe that it was the right thing it</text>
  <text start="296.24" dur="5.04">just cannot be done</text>
  <text start="298.76" dur="5.88">the genie is out of the Hat or whatever</text>
  <text start="301.28" dur="5.46">the evidence of tax cuts by the way</text>
  <text start="304.64" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about that tax receipts</text>
  <text start="306.74" dur="4.8">have soar so the evidence is in I mean</text>
  <text start="309.17" dur="4.29">tax cuts work tax receipts soared in the</text>
  <text start="311.54" dur="3.9">u.s. after the recent tax cuts now the</text>
  <text start="313.46" dur="3.57">left of course is trying to blame the</text>
  <text start="315.44" dur="3.78">tax cuts for the deficit</text>
  <text start="317.03" dur="3.48">all right so let me read through this</text>
  <text start="319.22" dur="2.76">quote from Zero Hedge from this little</text>
  <text start="320.51" dur="4.89">bit of this article in denial</text>
  <text start="321.98" dur="5.34">however some commentators continue to</text>
  <text start="325.4" dur="3.6">deny the positive impact of tax cuts</text>
  <text start="327.32" dur="4.14">using the arguments that deficits rise</text>
  <text start="329" dur="4.8">the fallacy that deficits rise has</text>
  <text start="331.46" dur="4.05">nothing to do with tax cuts but with</text>
  <text start="333.8" dur="4.679">increases in government spending on top</text>
  <text start="335.51" dur="5.46">of the tax cuts the deficit excuses very</text>
  <text start="338.479" dur="3.541">simple it says taxes should not be cut</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="3.63">because governments will spend all</text>
  <text start="342.02" dur="6.209">revenues even if these increase and more</text>
  <text start="344.6" dur="5.85">but this excuse is wrong the mistake of</text>
  <text start="348.229" dur="4.891">pointing at deficits as proof that tax</text>
  <text start="350.45" dur="4.5">cuts don&amp;#39;t work is debunked by looking</text>
  <text start="353.12" dur="4.29">at the proposals of the same economists</text>
  <text start="354.95" dur="4.44">that argue against tax cuts economist</text>
  <text start="357.41" dur="3.99">Paul Krugman is one example if you can</text>
  <text start="359.39" dur="3.839">call him that he argued against tax cuts</text>
  <text start="361.4" dur="2.46">in his New York Times article I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="363.229" dur="2.881">like that guy</text>
  <text start="363.86" dur="4.11">time to borrow after the Obama</text>
  <text start="366.11" dur="4.59">administration increased debt by 10</text>
  <text start="367.97" dur="4.86">trillion dollars these demand side</text>
  <text start="370.7" dur="3.96">economists defend deficit spending yet</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="4.11">consider tax cuts as negative because</text>
  <text start="374.66" dur="3.72">deficits may increase only Keynesian</text>
  <text start="376.94" dur="4.979">economists managed to pull off such</text>
  <text start="378.38" dur="5.82">mind-bending logic deficits need not</text>
  <text start="381.919" dur="3.181">rise or exist at all if government spend</text>
  <text start="384.2" dur="3.42">in line with revenue</text>
  <text start="385.1" dur="4.32">growth and the evidence points to rising</text>
  <text start="387.62" dur="5.76">revenues from lower taxes and higher</text>
  <text start="389.42" dur="6.06">growth basically control your damn</text>
  <text start="393.38" dur="4.35">spending and you don&amp;#39;t have to worry so</text>
  <text start="395.48" dur="4.86">much about having less money coming in</text>
  <text start="397.73" dur="3.84">although by the way it brings in more</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="4.14">money when you lower taxes for</text>
  <text start="401.57" dur="4.98">governments it&amp;#39;s a-- we&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text>
  <text start="404.48" dur="5.55">about Strock a little bit it&amp;#39;s uh</text>
  <text start="406.55" dur="5.61">actually made him read his own actually</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="4.34">make him read his own texts okay</text>
  <text start="412.16" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s brilliant let me go through here</text>
  <text start="414.37" dur="4.72">actually I&amp;#39;m gonna talk about all of it</text>
  <text start="416.3" dur="4.44">one we have Gohmert I think I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="419.09" dur="3.54">that right says you&amp;#39;re a good liar mr.</text>
  <text start="420.74" dur="4.29">struck how many times did you look into</text>
  <text start="422.63" dur="3.27">your wife&amp;#39;s eyes and lied to her about</text>
  <text start="425.03" dur="2.01">Lisa page</text>
  <text start="425.9" dur="3.42">now that&amp;#39;s paraphrasing you actually</text>
  <text start="427.04" dur="3.51">said something like your wife&amp;#39;s innocent</text>
  <text start="429.32" dur="2.43">eyes or something like or innocently</text>
  <text start="430.55" dur="2.85">into your wife&amp;#39;s eyes or something like</text>
  <text start="431.75" dur="4.44">that but that&amp;#39;s basically what he said</text>
  <text start="433.4" dur="4.83">and it was beautiful the people in there</text>
  <text start="436.19" dur="4.62">the whole room went insane they knew</text>
  <text start="438.23" dur="4.32">that it was a bad hit from perspective</text>
  <text start="440.81" dur="4.86">because it looks really bad for struck</text>
  <text start="442.55" dur="6.12">so they just went crazy and just started</text>
  <text start="445.67" dur="4.83">trying to block in and in call foul and</text>
  <text start="448.67" dur="3.03">everything else I think it&amp;#39;s a fair</text>
  <text start="450.5" dur="4.83">question a means a liar</text>
  <text start="451.7" dur="6.6">so his morality you know his ethics and</text>
  <text start="455.33" dur="5.94">his lies are on the world debate stage</text>
  <text start="458.3" dur="6.87">right now because all of this definitely</text>
  <text start="461.27" dur="6.81">implies that he would have acted on his</text>
  <text start="465.17" dur="3.96">his text messages to try to to do</text>
  <text start="468.08" dur="3.24">something about this</text>
  <text start="469.13" dur="4.23">Trump Russia thing you know obviously he</text>
  <text start="471.32" dur="3.33">said that he would stop Trump and you</text>
  <text start="473.36" dur="4.38">know he now he&amp;#39;s trying to claim that</text>
  <text start="474.65" dur="5.64">you know he&amp;#39;s not really you know his</text>
  <text start="477.74" dur="5.27">personal biases is just kept at home and</text>
  <text start="480.29" dur="5.85">it doesn&amp;#39;t affect his job</text>

  <text start="510.59" dur="2.9">year I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="511.66" dur="3.689">the question every American should ask</text>

  <text start="1357.11" dur="4.86">to doing a thing with him about his</text>

  <text start="1361.97" dur="7.53">Trump and his Q shirt</text>
  <text start="1364.19" dur="7.02">I have ly Stranahan has agreed to a one</text>
  <text start="1369.5" dur="3.36">proof per day Twitter debate which I</text>
  <text start="1371.21" dur="3.27">actually think will be better you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1372.86" dur="3.09">avoid all of the drama and the crosstalk</text>
  <text start="1374.48" dur="5.22">and the heated emotions you can think</text>
  <text start="1375.95" dur="5.37">about your responses and and and offer</text>
  <text start="1379.7" dur="3.14">all the links and all the images and</text>
  <text start="1381.32" dur="3.96">everything else you need you have time</text>
  <text start="1382.84" dur="4.57">and all of the logical fallacy stuff the</text>
  <text start="1385.28" dur="4.92">whole community will call out so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1387.41" dur="5.4">too worried about engaging in that so if</text>
  <text start="1390.2" dur="4.68">you&amp;#39;re interested the five hour video</text>
  <text start="1392.81" dur="4.08">that we did which is highly interesting</text>
  <text start="1394.88" dur="4.02">for a kind of a logical fallacy</text>
  <text start="1396.89" dur="3.12">perspective and in kind of what they</text>
  <text start="1398.9" dur="4.14">will do to you and you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1400.01" dur="4.83">debate this stuff it wasn&amp;#39;t so much of a</text>
  <text start="1403.04" dur="4.26">victory for me as it was I would say a</text>
  <text start="1404.84" dur="6.57">loss for him like I did badly I think I</text>
  <text start="1407.3" dur="5.85">did badly because he did actually pick</text>
  <text start="1411.41" dur="3.04">out a couple of things from the queue</text>
  <text start="1413.15" dur="2.95">proofs like</text>
  <text start="1414.45" dur="4.65">be Tom right and he weakened to those</text>
  <text start="1416.1" dur="4.74">arguments with very good points okay</text>
  <text start="1419.1" dur="3.69">like like for example Trump has said</text>
  <text start="1420.84" dur="4.44">tippy-top in 2016</text>
  <text start="1422.79" dur="4.23">okay now I still think the way he said</text>
  <text start="1425.28" dur="3.36">it in the context and everything else</text>
  <text start="1427.02" dur="3.18">standing next to White Rabbit all of</text>
  <text start="1428.64" dur="3.48">that obviously there&amp;#39;s something there</text>
  <text start="1430.2" dur="3.41">it&amp;#39;s a rare phrase but that&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="1432.12" dur="4.05">argument right if he&amp;#39;s used it before</text>
  <text start="1433.61" dur="6.16">that plays into his cold reading</text>
  <text start="1436.17" dur="5.19">argument but we have 90 plus proofs at</text>
  <text start="1439.77" dur="5.01">this point I&amp;#39;ve lost count hundred plus</text>
  <text start="1441.36" dur="5.58">at this point and he avoided the rest so</text>
  <text start="1444.78" dur="3.84">he would only let you know he would he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1446.94" dur="4.53">pick apart like 1 or 2 and then pretend</text>
  <text start="1448.62" dur="4.65">that he that he would not have the time</text>
  <text start="1451.47" dur="3.3">or didn&amp;#39;t want to waste the time to go</text>
  <text start="1453.27" dur="2.85">through all of them and he would jump</text>
  <text start="1454.77" dur="4.23">topics that kind of stuff so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1456.12" dur="5.24">interesting there was a point where we</text>
  <text start="1459" dur="4.53">got heated but we&amp;#39;re polite so you know</text>
  <text start="1461.36" dur="3.79">even if we were not polite I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1463.53" dur="4.53">anybody to be rude to him on my behalf</text>
  <text start="1465.15" dur="4.38">but I think that you&amp;#39;ll be interesting</text>
  <text start="1468.06" dur="2.94">to have that as well on Twitter if</text>
  <text start="1469.53" dur="3.54">you&amp;#39;re interested in in the debate</text>
  <text start="1471" dur="3.12">perspective which by the way I get a lot</text>
  <text start="1473.07" dur="3.32">of people saying don&amp;#39;t waste your time</text>
  <text start="1474.12" dur="5.34">on this and I really appreciate you guys</text>
  <text start="1476.39" dur="5.11">let me just qualify very briefly why</text>

  <text start="1497.88" dur="2.67">like I don&amp;#39;t like the way the slides</text>
  <text start="1498.99" dur="2.82">work and all I&amp;#39;ve got a proof video</text>
  <text start="1500.55" dur="4.86">coming out soon and you&amp;#39;re gonna see how</text>

  <text start="1533.82" dur="5.46">with the MSM directing them to these</text>
  <text start="1535.77" dur="6.15">lying chills who are like make it who</text>
  <text start="1539.28" dur="4.02">are for example like like like one</text>

  <text start="1547.86" dur="2.97">and that&amp;#39;s why I want to go through</text>
  <text start="1549.539" dur="3">these debates and get the fake proofs</text>
  <text start="1550.83" dur="4.079">out because we have some bad proofs in</text>
