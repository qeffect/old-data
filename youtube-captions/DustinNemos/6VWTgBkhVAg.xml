  <text start="10.43" dur="5.96">back by the most powerful force</text>
  <text start="29.05" dur="4.15">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="31.58" dur="3.54">most of any most news network</text>
  <text start="33.2" dur="3.18">briefly I want to dive into what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="35.12" dur="4.02">happening with the Biden and the</text>
  <text start="36.38" dur="5.609">impeachment situation Ukraine and all of</text>
  <text start="39.14" dur="4.59">the drama that&amp;#39;s unfolding and it seems</text>
  <text start="41.989" dur="3.271">in my opinion at least here the</text>
  <text start="43.73" dur="4.41">Democrats have really overplayed their</text>
  <text start="45.26" dur="4.74">hand they&amp;#39;ve made a terrible mistake and</text>
  <text start="48.14" dur="5.01">now they&amp;#39;ve shown that really they they</text>
  <text start="50" dur="5.91">either are very stupid or have no teeth</text>
  <text start="53.15" dur="5.19">so you pay you take your pick you know</text>
  <text start="55.91" dur="3.72">if you&amp;#39;re on our team perhaps you maybe</text>
  <text start="58.34" dur="3.6">maybe you think they&amp;#39;re both stupid and</text>
  <text start="59.63" dur="4.92">weak but even if you&amp;#39;re on the left and</text>
  <text start="61.94" dur="4.5">you are like the most die-hard and Tifa</text>
  <text start="64.55" dur="2.31">and you hate Trump with all of your</text>
  <text start="66.44" dur="2.58">heart</text>
  <text start="66.86" dur="4.47">this has to be demoralizing for them</text>
  <text start="69.02" dur="4.17">this has to look like weakness because</text>
  <text start="71.33" dur="3.78">they they tried the impeachment thing in</text>
  <text start="73.19" dur="4.11">here before an election because of</text>
  <text start="75.11" dur="4.11">desperation and their own crimes being</text>
  <text start="77.3" dur="4.65">revealed and it fell apart</text>
  <text start="79.22" dur="7.11">within a week all right folks let&amp;#39;s dive</text>
  <text start="81.95" dur="8.93">in so let&amp;#39;s go through what we know so</text>
  <text start="86.33" dur="6.45">far of the Democrat latest scandal crazy</text>
  <text start="90.88" dur="3.64">attempt whatever you want to call it</text>
  <text start="92.78" dur="3.75">this is just nonsense at this point it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="94.52" dur="3.69">presidential harassment as Trump keeps</text>
  <text start="96.53" dur="3.96">tweeting out lately</text>
  <text start="98.21" dur="4.53">Democrats reveal the real purpose of the</text>
  <text start="100.49" dur="3.78">impeachment investigation so the</text>
  <text start="102.74" dur="3.36">Democrats know that there is no</text>
  <text start="104.27" dur="4.169">impeachable offense this from true</text>
  <text start="106.1" dur="3.809">pundit what they intend to do is to use</text>
  <text start="108.439" dur="3.481">the investigation to look into every</text>
  <text start="109.909" dur="4.17">aspect of Trump&amp;#39;s life and try to make</text>
  <text start="111.92" dur="4.05">dirt out of things unrelated to his talk</text>
  <text start="114.079" dur="4.771">with the Ukrainian president this</text>
  <text start="115.97" dur="5.07">impeachment investigation is a political</text>
  <text start="118.85" dur="4.559">act to help their candidate win the next</text>
  <text start="121.04" dur="4.11">presidential election Democrats</text>
  <text start="123.409" dur="4.021">themselves describe it this way for</text>
  <text start="125.15" dur="3.48">example here is how Rob called the</text>
  <text start="127.43" dur="4.83">director of one of the progressives</text>
  <text start="128.63" dur="6.24">Democrat websites described the purpose</text>
  <text start="132.26" dur="4.229">of the investigation quote the idea</text>
  <text start="134.87" dur="3.75">should be to keep the impeachment going</text>
  <text start="136.489" dur="3.78">as long as possible with new testimonies</text>
  <text start="138.62" dur="3.3">and new releases of disclosures of</text>
  <text start="140.269" dur="5.461">alleged corruption in treason on a</text>
  <text start="141.92" dur="5.52">regular basis guys it&amp;#39;s comin and what</text>
  <text start="145.73" dur="3.15">happens if we lose twenty twenty they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="147.44" dur="4.44">gonna go after him throw him in prison</text>

  <text start="151.88" dur="5.54">trumped up no pun intended are a little</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="6.17">maybe a trumped-up charges against Trump</text>
  <text start="157.42" dur="5.819">himself and it&amp;#39;s basically the same for</text>
  <text start="161.2" dur="4.59">all of us you know if you&amp;#39;ve stood up to</text>
  <text start="163.239" dur="5.071">this to this mob if you stood up to this</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="4.559">group if you have made it if especially</text>
  <text start="168.31" dur="3.87">as a public figure anyone who has any</text>
  <text start="170.349" dur="3.421">sort of popularity that&amp;#39;s who they</text>
  <text start="172.18" dur="3.12">target so if you have influence if you</text>
  <text start="173.77" dur="3.99">have reach if you have a voice no matter</text>
  <text start="175.3" dur="3.9">how small it is you know myself I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="177.76" dur="2.58">been attacked by the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="4.319">and I&amp;#39;m just a small youtube channel</text>
  <text start="180.34" dur="4.74">guys I&amp;#39;ve just someone who you know I</text>
  <text start="183.519" dur="3.631">hope to build the Q movement I hope to</text>
  <text start="185.08" dur="4.47">bring some attention to that and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="4.589">been reporting on corruption and human</text>
  <text start="189.55" dur="3.57">trafficking and you know economics an</text>
  <text start="191.739" dur="3.091">alternative health and stuff like that</text>
  <text start="193.12" dur="3.929">you know I try to cover a lot of stuff</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="3.93">because you know I see myself as someone</text>
  <text start="197.049" dur="4.41">who&amp;#39;s trying to track the trends trying</text>
  <text start="198.76" dur="4.71">to track the war as it were you know the</text>
  <text start="201.459" dur="4.651">the nonviolent war but this is a war</text>
  <text start="203.47" dur="5.25">this is a war of digital soldiers and</text>
  <text start="206.11" dur="4.98">information and and branding and</text>
  <text start="208.72" dur="5.099">marketing and campaigns and influence</text>
  <text start="211.09" dur="4.35">and and pulsed interest and sustained</text>
  <text start="213.819" dur="3.961">interest and all these other things you</text>
  <text start="215.44" dur="3.72">have to understand it&amp;#39;s not a hot war</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="3.989">we&amp;#39;re not fighting in Tifa in the</text>
  <text start="219.16" dur="4.949">streets most of the time most of us</text>
  <text start="221.769" dur="3.991">although I have seen an Tifa in the</text>
  <text start="224.109" dur="4.35">streets and I&amp;#39;ve actually been part of</text>
  <text start="225.76" dur="4.949">an altercation in defense of course so</text>
  <text start="228.459" dur="4.801">you know there are things like that but</text>
  <text start="230.709" dur="5.34">for the most part we&amp;#39;re digital soldiers</text>
  <text start="233.26" dur="4.5">here and you know we always we always</text>
  <text start="236.049" dur="3.241">push for non-violence and all that stuff</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="3.09">of course because they try to link the Q</text>
  <text start="239.29" dur="3.6">movement to violence I want to be clear</text>
  <text start="240.85" dur="4.65">about that but you know this is the</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="4.2">corruption that we seek to expose this</text>
  <text start="245.5" dur="3.75">is the corruption that you know all</text>
  <text start="247.09" dur="4.92">folks who care about this country or</text>
  <text start="249.25" dur="5.76">even corruption you know the elites</text>
  <text start="252.01" dur="5.34">corruption versus the the low-class or</text>
  <text start="255.01" dur="4.229">the people anywhere in the world this</text>
  <text start="257.35" dur="3.479">affects them because America sets a</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="3.3">standard for the rest of the world and</text>
  <text start="260.829" dur="6.301">it is an example for many other</text>
  <text start="262.539" dur="6.991">countries so what we do here it it seeps</text>
  <text start="267.13" dur="3.87">out just like our fake news has seeped</text>
  <text start="269.53" dur="3.09">out to the rest of the world and is</text>
  <text start="271" dur="3.03">lying to other people as well because</text>
  <text start="272.62" dur="4.47">you know CNN&amp;#39;s in so many different</text>
  <text start="274.03" dur="5.009">countries at this point however the the</text>
  <text start="277.09" dur="4.11">Renaissance of our culture will also</text>
  <text start="279.039" dur="4.021">seep out and that anti corruption push</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="4.26">you&amp;#39;ve seen it you&amp;#39;ve seen that seep out</text>
  <text start="283.06" dur="4.05">as well because we&amp;#39;ve now seen other</text>
  <text start="285.46" dur="3.51">nationalist leaders start to sort of</text>
  <text start="287.11" dur="3.66">mimic trauma and he wasn&amp;#39;t even the</text>
  <text start="288.97" dur="2.339">first well we could talk about brexit as</text>
  <text start="290.77" dur="2.399">well</text>
  <text start="291.309" dur="4.021">you know which is you know not a person</text>
  <text start="293.169" dur="4.71">but a movement you know I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="295.33" dur="4.649">what shone showed Trump you know finally</text>
  <text start="297.879" dur="4.44">that his time had come to make a move</text>
  <text start="299.979" dur="3.84">you know he&amp;#39;s someone like myself far</text>
  <text start="302.319" dur="3.84">better at it than me who watches these</text>
  <text start="303.819" dur="4.14">trends he&amp;#39;s been waiting to strike to be</text>
  <text start="306.159" dur="4.32">president for quite a long time for</text>
  <text start="307.959" dur="4.2">those who study this history he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="310.479" dur="4.29">he&amp;#39;s been exploring this for a very long</text>
  <text start="312.159" dur="3.75">time you know and some folks have been</text>
  <text start="314.769" dur="3.811">there with him for quite a while you</text>
  <text start="315.909" dur="4.98">know for example Roger stone was with</text>
  <text start="318.58" dur="5.28">way back there talking to him about this</text>
  <text start="320.889" dur="5.07">for a long time so and pushing him to be</text>
  <text start="323.86" dur="3.989">President many people wanted him to run</text>
  <text start="325.959" dur="3.901">for president he just he was biding his</text>
  <text start="327.849" dur="5.391">time until the right moment to strike as</text>
  <text start="329.86" dur="5.72">this man he is a stable genius now</text>
  <text start="333.24" dur="5.439">moving on a little bit we have also</text>
  <text start="335.58" dur="6.16">Trump demanding shift to resign over his</text>
  <text start="338.679" dur="6.21">his fake news parody reading of the</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="6.12">Ukraine call he got caught so basically</text>
  <text start="344.889" dur="4.2">what happened is Adam Schiff if you</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="3.359">haven&amp;#39;t seen the clip it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="349.089" dur="4.17">revealing its really damning he goes</text>
  <text start="351.219" dur="4.41">through the entire conversation but he</text>
  <text start="353.259" dur="4.41">makes up his own words to it so he he</text>
  <text start="355.629" dur="3.81">puts on this slant he basically makes it</text>
  <text start="357.669" dur="3.06">out as though you know he&amp;#39;s Trump and</text>
  <text start="359.439" dur="3.87">he&amp;#39;s mimicking this treasonous statement</text>
  <text start="360.729" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s treason this conversation it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="363.309" dur="3.45">like the leftists always do they make up</text>
  <text start="364.899" dur="3.72">something that sounds kind of similar to</text>
  <text start="366.759" dur="3.42">what&amp;#39;s going on like they&amp;#39;re both sort</text>
  <text start="368.619" dur="3.3">of based on a call between Trump and</text>
  <text start="370.179" dur="4.59">Ukraine but that&amp;#39;s where it ends that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="371.919" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s the final link up between the two</text>
  <text start="374.769" dur="4.29">because reality diverges at this point</text>
  <text start="376.719" dur="3.87">that reality goes this way and Adam</text>
  <text start="379.059" dur="3.39">Schiff and the Democrats they they take</text>
  <text start="380.589" dur="4.17">a different path you know two roads</text>
  <text start="382.449" dur="4.5">diverged into a wood and I I took the</text>
  <text start="384.759" dur="3.87">one less traveled well Adam Schiff took</text>
  <text start="386.949" dur="5.67">the one that was a little crazy in rocky</text>
  <text start="388.629" dur="6.78">and in his sense he he he wants to put</text>
  <text start="392.619" dur="6.39">forward am excuse me he wants to put</text>
  <text start="395.409" dur="5.55">forward a strong front a confident front</text>
  <text start="399.009" dur="4.291">that this can this can be done this can</text>
  <text start="400.959" dur="3.54">this can actually work to rally the</text>
  <text start="403.3" dur="3.269">troops to his cause that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="404.499" dur="4.56">energetics right it&amp;#39;s like opium they</text>
  <text start="406.569" dur="3.96">need some encouragement they seem they</text>
  <text start="409.059" dur="3.181">need some motivation to believe that</text>
  <text start="410.529" dur="3.42">they can support or commit to it to get</text>
  <text start="412.24" dur="3.779">them to actually commit energy and</text>
  <text start="413.949" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s with everyone right I&amp;#39;m dealing</text>
  <text start="416.019" dur="3.93">with that right now in trying to create</text>
  <text start="418.059" dur="3.66">a campaign against censorship with stop</text>
  <text start="419.949" dur="4.231">at burning calm there&amp;#39;s a lot of folks</text>
  <text start="421.719" dur="2.941">who are very interested however they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="424.18" dur="1.59">they&amp;#39;re a little</text>
  <text start="424.66" dur="2.64">pessimistically don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="4.2">possible right they don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="427.3" dur="3.87">strong enough well Adam is trying to</text>
  <text start="429.97" dur="2.76">convince the Democrats that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="431.17" dur="3.54">strong enough to do this but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="432.73" dur="3.75">and everyone knows it so he&amp;#39;s made them</text>
  <text start="434.71" dur="2.31">all with weak he&amp;#39;s made them all look</text>
  <text start="436.48" dur="4.29">stupid</text>
  <text start="437.02" dur="5.37">now how did this go over well no one</text>
  <text start="440.77" dur="3.09">bought it I mean some people I think</text>
  <text start="442.39" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;re even laughing if I&amp;#39;m if I recall</text>
  <text start="443.86" dur="4.71">correctly in the room and now President</text>
  <text start="446.41" dur="3.96">Trump you know is is of course defending</text>
  <text start="448.57" dur="3.42">himself and reacting to this and he has</text>
  <text start="450.37" dur="3.9">a much bigger voice than than an Adam</text>
  <text start="451.99" dur="4.23">Schiff so you know Adam has no chance to</text>
  <text start="454.27" dur="3.57">pull this off and Nadler and Pelosi and</text>
  <text start="456.22" dur="3.9">the others of course working with Soros</text>
  <text start="457.84" dur="5.28">to try to overthrow our duly elected</text>
  <text start="460.12" dur="6.27">president you know that was a bit of a</text>
  <text start="463.12" dur="4.86">sigh grant I guess but you know let&amp;#39;s be</text>
  <text start="466.39" dur="3.63">honest I&amp;#39;ll read the the conversation</text>
  <text start="467.98" dur="4.86">and we&amp;#39;ll finish but but let&amp;#39;s be honest</text>
  <text start="470.02" dur="6.36">this is the the antics of a child you</text>
  <text start="472.84" dur="5.07">know I have an 18 month old and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.38" dur="3.81">more mature than this you know she</text>
  <text start="477.91" dur="4.02">doesn&amp;#39;t even speak yet but I&amp;#39;ve seen her</text>
  <text start="480.19" dur="3.36">when she gets angry you know lately</text>
  <text start="481.93" dur="2.85">she&amp;#39;s really dead she&amp;#39;s matured a lot in</text>
  <text start="483.55" dur="3.96">the last few months when she gets angry</text>
  <text start="484.78" dur="4.62">about something she can she&amp;#39;ll freeze up</text>
  <text start="487.51" dur="3.33">for a second and almost get angry and</text>
  <text start="489.4" dur="4.5">then she decides it&amp;#39;s not worth it I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="490.84" dur="6.24">just gonna go have fun again so even her</text>
  <text start="493.9" dur="4.83">has a better control of her emotional</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="4.23">state I think than some of these</text>
  <text start="498.73" dur="4.11">Democrats like the for example in Maxine</text>
  <text start="501.31" dur="5.04">Waters types</text>
  <text start="502.84" dur="6.18">now what Schiff has done was revealed</text>
  <text start="506.35" dur="4.5">that without lies they have nothing let</text>
  <text start="509.02" dur="3.63">me read the quote representative Adam</text>
  <text start="510.85" dur="3.42">Schiff fraudulently read to Congress</text>
  <text start="512.65" dur="3.6">with millions of people watching a</text>
  <text start="514.27" dur="3.63">version of my conversation with the</text>
  <text start="516.25" dur="3.87">president of Ukraine that doesn&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="517.9" dur="4.35">he was supposedly reading the exact</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="3.96">transcribed version of the call but he</text>
  <text start="522.25" dur="4.34">completely changed the words to make it</text>
  <text start="524.08" dur="4.92">sound horrible and me sound guilty</text>
  <text start="526.59" dur="4.54">remember I talked about this and I</text>
  <text start="529" dur="3.45">showed Lee there was the line from the</text>
  <text start="531.13" dur="3.57">first sentence in there and then the</text>
  <text start="532.45" dur="3.6">rest of it was like all cut out and then</text>
