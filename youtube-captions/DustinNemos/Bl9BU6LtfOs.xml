  <text start="18.69" dur="3.9">potentially billions of dollars being</text>
  <text start="20.4" dur="3.75">taken from Big Pharma and possibly</text>
  <text start="22.59" dur="3.509">millions of injuries saved throughout</text>
  <text start="24.15" dur="4.17">the years he&amp;#39;s worried you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="26.099" dur="4.141">been awarded many awards in his field</text>

  <text start="37.739" dur="3.541">you and your channel and actually I</text>
  <text start="40.11" dur="2.879">think you have one of the prettiest</text>
  <text start="41.28" dur="5.25">babies on the face of the earth anything</text>
  <text start="42.989" dur="5.671">I appreciate that I did . you know just</text>
  <text start="46.53" dur="3.93">all of the nutrition I went to the dr.</text>
  <text start="48.66" dur="3.87">Mercola list and I did the raw and made</text>
  <text start="50.46" dur="4.529">my wife eat the raw egg every day they</text>
  <text start="52.53" dur="5.759">were Ganic raw egg the smoothies the the</text>
  <text start="54.989" dur="5.671">vitamins everything so so what so this</text>
  <text start="58.289" dur="4.2">is interesting so what you what you what</text>
  <text start="60.66" dur="5.73">you practiced and what you implemented</text>
  <text start="62.489" dur="6.271">was preventive medicine yeah yeah and as</text>
  <text start="66.39" dur="4.83">you mentioned in my intro in addition to</text>
  <text start="68.76" dur="4.2">being a surgeon and I retired a little</text>
  <text start="71.22" dur="3.09">over a year ago I practiced orthopedic</text>
  <text start="72.96" dur="3.93">surgery for 32 years</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="6.93">but in addition to that I have worked in</text>
  <text start="76.89" dur="6.03">the field of prevention for 32 years as</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="4.919">well and continue to to this day</text>
  <text start="82.92" dur="5.07">actually and it&amp;#39;s interesting because if</text>
  <text start="86.159" dur="6.481">you look at the amount of money</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="10.11">allocated into healthcare 99% of it is</text>
  <text start="92.64" dur="9.51">allocated into being reactive yeah and</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="7.159">and a very small fraction probably less</text>
  <text start="102.15" dur="7.2">than 1% in actuality is allocated into</text>
  <text start="105.259" dur="7.75">prevention and as you mentioned in the</text>
  <text start="109.35" dur="5.19">introduction our research of which I was</text>
  <text start="113.009" dur="3.241">one of the heads of our research team</text>
  <text start="114.54" dur="4.829">that focused on trying to prevent</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="4.89">injuries in particular in sports a small</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="4.021">example of the bang for the buck to get</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="7.14">in prevention in just one series of</text>
  <text start="123.39" dur="6.929">studies we we saved and prevented 1.7</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="4.41">million people every year from being</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="3.39">injured according to the CDC and</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="2.549">prevention that</text>
  <text start="133.709" dur="2.821">analyzed our studies that were published</text>
  <text start="135.239" dur="3.691">in the peer-reviewed medical literature</text>
  <text start="136.53" dur="5.22">with the savings of two billion dollars</text>
  <text start="138.93" dur="5.789">in health care costs now for that series</text>
  <text start="141.75" dur="7.68">of studies Dustin we spent a thousand</text>
  <text start="144.719" dur="7.651">dollars once and it prevents 1.7 million</text>
  <text start="149.43" dur="6.63">people every year from going to the doc</text>
  <text start="152.37" dur="7.259">or going to the hospital and saves two</text>
  <text start="156.06" dur="5.25">billion dollars a year now here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="159.629" dur="6.11">frustrating part there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="161.31" dur="9.75">frustrating parts of that politically</text>
  <text start="165.739" dur="8.89">when those studies were presented well</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="7.22">big medicine did not wrap their arms</text>
  <text start="174.629" dur="6.631">around it and say this is great stuff</text>
  <text start="178.28" dur="6.429">what what else can we Wells can we do</text>
  <text start="181.26" dur="7.709">and when I founded the Institute for</text>
  <text start="184.709" dur="9.631">preventive sports medicine 30-some years</text>
  <text start="188.969" dur="7.5">ago back in 1989 I have founded an</text>
  <text start="194.34" dur="6.119">organization that I solely wanted to</text>
  <text start="196.469" dur="6.091">vote go boat research to prevention at</text>
  <text start="200.459" dur="3.571">the time it was the only organization of</text>
  <text start="202.56" dur="2.88">its kind that focused on health care</text>
  <text start="204.03" dur="5.819">cost containment looking through the</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="7.079">eyes of prevention hmm 32 years later or</text>
  <text start="209.849" dur="5.521">whoever it is now yeah almost 30 years</text>
  <text start="212.519" dur="4.68">later it&amp;#39;s still the only organization</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="3.119">that solely focuses on the prevention</text>
  <text start="217.199" dur="2.731">side of the equation as a means of</text>
  <text start="218.489" dur="3.03">cutting health care costs so many people</text>
  <text start="219.93" dur="3.69">say well you know Dave if what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.519" dur="6.271">saying about prevention being so</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="5.759">important why aren&amp;#39;t there thousands of</text>
  <text start="227.79" dur="4.259">these research institutes around the</text>
  <text start="229.379" dur="5.1">world why do you have such a hard time</text>
  <text start="232.049" dur="5.4">getting funding for your research</text>
  <text start="234.479" dur="6.6">why hasn&amp;#39;t big insurance companies ever</text>
  <text start="237.449" dur="6.51">put a penny into your Research Institute</text>
  <text start="241.079" dur="6.33">why haven&amp;#39;t pharmaceutical companies put</text>
  <text start="243.959" dur="5.67">a penny into your research institute and</text>
  <text start="247.409" dur="6.991">first of all the answer is there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="249.629" dur="8.42">money in prevention and in fact what we</text>
  <text start="254.4" dur="7.53">do in prevention is actually seen as</text>
  <text start="258.049" dur="6.211">being an enemy of the state when it</text>
  <text start="261.93" dur="4.169">comes to the insurance industry and the</text>
  <text start="264.26" dur="3.1">pharmaceutical industry and one quick</text>
  <text start="266.099" dur="3.06">example the</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="4.2">and about about the big insurance</text>
  <text start="269.159" dur="3.451">industry the Institute was in existence</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="4.68">for about ten years</text>
  <text start="272.61" dur="5.519">15 years at that point and I got a call</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="4.56">from a very high level insurance</text>
  <text start="278.129" dur="4.401">executive in New York and they said we</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="4.079">want I want to fly out meet with you I</text>
  <text start="282.53" dur="4.689">thought well finally they&amp;#39;re getting it</text>
  <text start="284.879" dur="4.651">they finally realize put a thousand</text>
  <text start="287.219" dur="3.841">bucks just into one study say 1.7</text>
  <text start="289.53" dur="2.97">million people from getting into say 2</text>
  <text start="291.06" dur="3.09">billion dollars in health care costs</text>
  <text start="292.5" dur="4.5">every they are finally getting it</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="5.37">guy flies out I&amp;#39;m sitting in my chair in</text>
  <text start="297" dur="5.93">our office and as fellow walks in in the</text>
  <text start="299.52" dur="6.239">room he looks at me and he goes because</text>
  <text start="302.93" dur="7.269">janda let me tell you why we despise you</text>
  <text start="305.759" dur="8.28">this is how it started and I looked at</text>
  <text start="310.199" dur="7.821">him I go excuse me but despise me I</text>
  <text start="314.039" dur="6.24">would think you&amp;#39;d embrace me because</text>
  <text start="318.02" dur="4.449">very small outlay and expenditures</text>
  <text start="320.279" dur="7.95">saving all these people pain suffering</text>
  <text start="322.469" dur="7.711">disability costs and he looks at me and</text>
  <text start="328.229" dur="6.03">he goes well you don&amp;#39;t really understand</text>
  <text start="330.18" dur="8.19">how the insurance industry works yeah I</text>
  <text start="334.259" dur="5.701">said all right and he goes now you know</text>
  <text start="338.37" dur="3.599">doctors are financial morons</text>
  <text start="339.96" dur="6.449">so let me just put this in very simple</text>
  <text start="341.969" dur="7.591">terms to you ok I go he said he says you</text>
  <text start="346.409" dur="6.991">cost us money he goes let&amp;#39;s say the cost</text>
  <text start="349.56" dur="7.469">of insuring you is a thousand bucks and</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="6.269">let&amp;#39;s say he goes and we can rig a track</text>
  <text start="357.029" dur="4.591">on about 7% on that get away with it</text>
  <text start="359.669" dur="4.981">with the Fed so your premium is gonna be</text>
  <text start="361.62" dur="4.68">a thousand seventy bucks because now you</text>
  <text start="364.65" dur="3">wrote this book the awakening of a</text>
  <text start="366.3" dur="2.76">surgeon you know that book that was on</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="3.06">Oprah and all this kind of stuff because</text>
  <text start="369.06" dur="2.94">you know yeah in the back of the book</text>
  <text start="370.71" dur="2.85">you talk about the 20 things that can be</text>
  <text start="372" dur="2.909">done to make every community safer and</text>
  <text start="373.56" dur="3.509">healthier and family safer and healthier</text>
  <text start="374.909" dur="3.66">because then our actuaries looked at</text>
  <text start="377.069" dur="4.051">that and actually the cost of insuring</text>
  <text start="378.569" dur="3.75">people will go for example as in the</text>
  <text start="381.12" dur="4.259">example we&amp;#39;re speaking here from a</text>
  <text start="382.319" dur="5.19">thousand bucks to a hundred bucks he</text>
  <text start="385.379" dur="6.72">goes now as a doctor and as a financial</text>
  <text start="387.509" dur="8.731">moron let me ask you a question what 7%</text>
  <text start="392.099" dur="7.35">of a hundred I go seven he goes what 7%</text>
  <text start="396.24" dur="4.95">of a thousand I go seventy he goes you</text>
  <text start="399.449" dur="4.021">see the higher costs go the bigger</text>
  <text start="401.19" dur="4.2">cut of the pie we get and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="403.47" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;ll we will do everything in our power</text>
  <text start="405.39" dur="6.78">to block your information from getting</text>
  <text start="408.51" dur="10.14">out yeah that was the end of that</text>
  <text start="412.17" dur="9.96">meeting yeah so needless to say I am not</text>
  <text start="418.65" dur="6.36">been a friend seen as a friend or do I</text>
  <text start="422.13" dur="5.58">deem friends of folks in the major</text>
  <text start="425.01" dur="4.74">insurance industry big insurance big</text>
  <text start="427.71" dur="4.98">pharmaceuticals because let&amp;#39;s face it in</text>
  <text start="429.75" dur="5.76">our work we prevent people from getting</text>
  <text start="432.69" dur="6.33">injured taking medications going to the</text>
  <text start="435.51" dur="7.77">hospital having surgeries I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="439.02" dur="6.81">physicians come to me granted not that</text>
  <text start="443.28" dur="5.67">many but still some who have come to me</text>
  <text start="445.83" dur="7.44">and said what are you doing what are you</text>
  <text start="448.95" dur="7.62">doing yeah you know you&amp;#39;re blocking</text>
  <text start="453.27" dur="4.65">people from coming to see us there have</text>
  <text start="456.57" dur="5.31">been very few physicians that have said</text>
  <text start="457.92" dur="5.73">but there have been the pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="461.88" dur="4.41">industry they don&amp;#39;t support the</text>
  <text start="463.65" dur="5.87">Institute because let&amp;#39;s face it you</text>
  <text start="466.29" dur="4.95">don&amp;#39;t get injured you don&amp;#39;t get meds and</text>
  <text start="469.52" dur="3.85">unfortunately it comes down to the</text>
  <text start="471.24" dur="5.88">almighty dollar mm-hm and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="473.37" dur="6.63">and unfortunately drives this and and</text>
  <text start="477.12" dur="4.59">and from a political standpoint when our</text>
  <text start="480" dur="3.66">prevention research started to get some</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="3.959">legs back in nineteen eighty eight</text>
  <text start="483.66" dur="3.93">actually because we started on our</text>
  <text start="485.669" dur="4.711">studies actually as far back as 1986</text>
  <text start="487.59" dur="6.93">there was one political person in the</text>
  <text start="490.38" dur="7.82">political realm who got wind of it who</text>
  <text start="494.52" dur="6.78">embraced it and that was Ronald Reagan I</text>
  <text start="498.2" dur="5.44">was in clinic one day and the phone rang</text>
  <text start="501.3" dur="4.74">and my assistant came to me said you got</text>

  <text start="517.14" dur="2.97">read an article that was in one of</text>
  <text start="518.46" dur="2.759">papers somewhere in the country and</text>
  <text start="520.11" dur="2.52">they&amp;#39;re interested in your work and</text>
  <text start="521.219" dur="4.021">prevention as a means of cutting costs</text>
  <text start="522.63" dur="6.78">by by empowering people</text>
  <text start="525.24" dur="6.539">I was like okay this is obviously a joke</text>

  <text start="751.45" dur="5.25">Reagan&amp;#39;s administration Bush won comes</text>
  <text start="754.21" dur="6.93">in and we present the same information</text>
  <text start="756.7" dur="7.56">and the response was Dustin we can&amp;#39;t do</text>

  <text start="778.6" dur="2.67">over there</text>
  <text start="779.38" dur="4.25">because we really don&amp;#39;t want to push</text>
  <text start="781.27" dur="6.45">this whole free market reform thing</text>
  <text start="783.63" dur="5.34">because it makes big industry really</text>
  <text start="787.72" dur="4.08">upset</text>
  <text start="788.97" dur="4.479">so now Bush is gone and Clinton comes in</text>
  <text start="791.8" dur="3.569">and I get contacted I said hey we</text>
  <text start="793.449" dur="6.351">understand you have some ideas on health</text>
  <text start="795.369" dur="6.78">care policy let&amp;#39;s see him so I undo that</text>
  <text start="799.8" dur="6.37">1988 package and they had some other</text>
  <text start="802.149" dur="6.69">things to it and the response was we</text>
  <text start="806.17" dur="4.56">can&amp;#39;t do that we don&amp;#39;t want to upset big</text>
  <text start="808.839" dur="3.9">insurance big big pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="810.73" dur="3.87">companies the am we you know how much</text>
  <text start="812.739" dur="4.921">money we get for so it was the exact</text>
  <text start="814.6" dur="4.709">same response I got from Bush one and</text>
  <text start="817.66" dur="4.229">when Bush two came in it was the exact</text>
  <text start="819.309" dur="4.83">same response and early on the sand I</text>
  <text start="821.889" dur="4.32">came to the realization that there was</text>
  <text start="824.139" dur="4.771">not two political parties in our country</text>
  <text start="826.209" dur="4.56">it was one political party that I called</text>
  <text start="828.91" dur="6.029">the Republic rats that are owned and</text>
  <text start="830.769" dur="6.331">operated by big big industry mm-hmm and</text>
  <text start="834.939" dur="4.231">they weren&amp;#39;t interested in the</text>
  <text start="837.1" dur="3.929">empowerment of people they were</text>
  <text start="839.17" dur="3.839">interested in the empowerment of</text>
  <text start="841.029" dur="5.581">government a government that was bought</text>
  <text start="843.009" dur="7.55">and paid for mm-hmm and it sounds very</text>
  <text start="846.61" dur="8.219">cynical but it&amp;#39;s what I experienced</text>
  <text start="850.559" dur="7.75">starting after Reagan left office you</text>
  <text start="854.829" dur="6.6">know you mentioned the the Biggs you</text>
  <text start="858.309" dur="4.62">know various different Biggs and this is</text>
  <text start="861.429" dur="3.09">an issue that we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve been battling</text>
  <text start="862.929" dur="4.291">you know since the inception of the</text>
  <text start="864.519" dur="4.56">country but the the thing that gets me</text>
  <text start="867.22" dur="4.529">is that people blame capitalism for</text>
  <text start="869.079" dur="4.141">these things they blame greed and they</text>
  <text start="871.749" dur="3.12">try to associate with that with</text>
  <text start="873.22" dur="3.359">capitalism when capitalism is free</text>
  <text start="874.869" dur="3.871">market and competition which drives down</text>
  <text start="876.579" dur="4.32">the price and and gives better quality</text>
  <text start="878.74" dur="3.719">and better speed a better service and</text>
  <text start="880.899" dur="4.021">everyone&amp;#39;s trying to earn your money</text>
  <text start="882.459" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s not this big conglomeration of</text>
  <text start="884.92" dur="3.329">these guys working together and</text>
  <text start="886.269" dur="3.961">basically creating a monopoly using the</text>
  <text start="888.249" dur="4.26">government force to do it and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="890.23" dur="4.889">what people don&amp;#39;t understand you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="892.509" dur="4.471">absolutely right and and you know what</text>
  <text start="895.119" dur="5.55">we&amp;#39;re when we start talking about these</text>
  <text start="896.98" dur="7.699">models of this incestuous relationship</text>
  <text start="900.669" dur="6.691">between big business and big government</text>
  <text start="904.679" dur="5.41">there are several names to it one is</text>
  <text start="907.36" dur="4.86">crony capitalism but it&amp;#39;s really beyond</text>
  <text start="910.089" dur="5.1">crony capitalism it really you know my</text>
  <text start="912.22" dur="5.94">mom was a history teacher and early on</text>
  <text start="915.189" dur="6.69">she taught me that when you have big</text>
  <text start="918.16" dur="5.89">business in collusion collusion with big</text>
  <text start="921.879" dur="4.15">government</text>
  <text start="924.05" dur="6.449">there&amp;#39;s really a different word for that</text>
  <text start="926.029" dur="6.3">and and the word is fascism yeah and it</text>
  <text start="930.499" dur="3.81">gets to a point and our other definition</text>
  <text start="932.329" dur="3.87">was authoritarian nationalism that pen</text>
  <text start="934.309" dur="5.671">eliza&amp;#39;s and punishes anyone and everyone</text>
  <text start="936.199" dur="6.63">who opposes the state mm-hmm right so</text>
  <text start="939.98" dur="10.639">let&amp;#39;s fast forward now let&amp;#39;s fast</text>
  <text start="942.829" dur="13.23">forward to Obama Obama was not a fan of</text>
  <text start="950.619" dur="8.111">Dave janda or prevention or my</text>
  <text start="956.059" dur="4.14">free-market approach the Obama</text>
  <text start="958.73" dur="4.319">administration got very mad at me</text>
  <text start="960.199" dur="6.211">because when the stimulus bill came out</text>
  <text start="963.049" dur="5.671">based on my contacts in Washington I was</text>
  <text start="966.41" dur="5.549">given a heads up and the heads up was</text>
  <text start="968.72" dur="5.089">hey Dave they&amp;#39;re hiding something the</text>
  <text start="971.959" dur="5.61">stimulus bill related to health care</text>
  <text start="973.809" dur="5.74">we know it we this is who&amp;#39;s been coming</text>
  <text start="977.569" dur="4.89">in and out of the West Wing we know it</text>
  <text start="979.549" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s something in there so when it</text>
  <text start="982.459" dur="4.29">was published by the Office of</text>
  <text start="984.799" dur="4.23">Management and Budget and the</text>
  <text start="986.749" dur="6.96">Congressional Budget Office I downloaded</text>
  <text start="989.029" dur="8.16">it that night and it took me about 400</text>
  <text start="993.709" dur="6.69">pages into the stimulus bill and there</text>
  <text start="997.189" dur="4.59">it was actually half of Obamacare was</text>
  <text start="1000.399" dur="3.6">actually hidden in the stimulus bill</text>
  <text start="1001.779" dur="4.98">Obamacare was really two parts the first</text>
  <text start="1003.999" dur="4.26">part was hidden in the stimulus bill and</text>
  <text start="1006.759" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s where a lot of the rationing boards</text>
  <text start="1008.259" dur="5.731">were in the enforcement boards were and</text>
  <text start="1011.019" dur="4.86">it was very similar organizations</text>
  <text start="1013.99" dur="3.449">agencies that were being created that</text>
  <text start="1015.879" dur="4.341">were very similar in Hillary care</text>
  <text start="1017.439" dur="5.06">Hillary was is not a fan of Dave janda</text>
  <text start="1020.22" dur="4.54">because I was one of the folks that</text>
  <text start="1022.499" dur="4.001">dissected Hillary care and said here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1024.76" dur="5.46">what&amp;#39;s good about it and here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1026.5" dur="5.97">bad about it not and again not this</text>
  <text start="1030.22" dur="5.52">right-left thing okay that&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="1032.47" dur="6.359">misnomers and the globalists used the</text>
  <text start="1035.74" dur="5.549">right left axis to get everybody at each</text>
  <text start="1038.829" dur="4.83">other&amp;#39;s throats to distract everybody to</text>
  <text start="1041.289" dur="4.65">divide people so they don&amp;#39;t people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1043.659" dur="4.201">realize that the bad guys the the</text>
  <text start="1045.939" dur="3.541">globalists this agency we&amp;#39;re going up</text>
  <text start="1047.86" dur="3.72">down right yeah up being freedom down</text>
  <text start="1049.48" dur="3.809">being oppression their goal is to strip</text>
  <text start="1051.58" dur="3.449">as many as much freedom and liberty of</text>
  <text start="1053.289" dur="3.481">every American of every person of the</text>
  <text start="1055.029" dur="2.671">world and oppress as many people as</text>
  <text start="1056.77" dur="2.279">possible so they</text>
  <text start="1057.7" dur="3.78">get more power more control and</text>
  <text start="1059.049" dur="8.61">ultimately more finances out of out of</text>
  <text start="1061.48" dur="8.73">the society and and so this was not a</text>
  <text start="1067.659" dur="5.791">when I dissected Hillary carrot this was</text>
  <text start="1070.21" dur="4.74">not a conservative liberal issue in fact</text>
  <text start="1073.45" dur="2.88">one of the first things I was taught</text>
  <text start="1074.95" dur="5.01">through the Reagan administration when I</text>
  <text start="1076.33" dur="7.469">got there was look this right left axis</text>
  <text start="1079.96" dur="6.42">is theater okay that the president wants</text>
  <text start="1083.799" dur="5.191">you to focus on the up/down axis but</text>
  <text start="1086.38" dur="6.149">being freedom down being oppression okay</text>
  <text start="1088.99" dur="5.37">focus on up down forget right left so</text>
  <text start="1092.529" dur="4.351">when I looked at Hillary care I did it</text>
  <text start="1094.36" dur="3.99">on an up/down axis and there was a</text>
  <text start="1096.88" dur="3.029">little bit of good in it but there was a</text>
  <text start="1098.35" dur="3.03">as I said a whole lot of bad because the</text>
  <text start="1099.909" dur="2.791">whole lot of bad focused on stripping</text>
  <text start="1101.38" dur="3.6">people of their freedoms and liberties</text>
  <text start="1102.7" dur="4.05">and creating organizations that would</text>
  <text start="1104.98" dur="4.02">take control of people&amp;#39;s health care</text>
  <text start="1106.75" dur="4.47">delivery system as opposed to empowering</text>
  <text start="1109" dur="4.71">people like prevention and wellness does</text>
  <text start="1111.22" dur="5.549">and and medical savings accounts or</text>
  <text start="1113.71" dur="5.849">whanau health savings accounts do it was</text>
  <text start="1116.769" dur="5.551">exactly the opposite and and frankly</text>
  <text start="1119.559" dur="4.5">that information how I had delivered to</text>
  <text start="1122.32" dur="4.349">senator Dole who was the majority leader</text>
  <text start="1124.059" dur="4.651">at the time and a number of other people</text>
  <text start="1126.669" dur="3.87">I provided it to both sides of the aisle</text>
  <text start="1128.71" dur="5.91">said you need to be aware of this okay</text>
  <text start="1130.539" dur="6.571">well the Clintons didn&amp;#39;t look favorably</text>
  <text start="1134.62" dur="6.24">upon that because that was some of that</text>
  <text start="1137.11" dur="8.25">was used to take down Hillary now in</text>
  <text start="1140.86" dur="6.809">fast-forward to Obamacare and I along</text>
  <text start="1145.36" dur="3.84">with several others had identified there</text>

  <text start="1158.95" dur="7.79">the healthcare bill didn&amp;#39;t pass until</text>
  <text start="1160.45" dur="9.569">March of 2010 a year later so in July</text>
  <text start="1166.74" dur="4.419">stimulus bill had passed and Pelosi who</text>
  <text start="1170.019" dur="3.691">was a Speaker of the House that time was</text>
  <text start="1171.159" dur="4.321">really pushing to get the health care</text>
  <text start="1173.71" dur="4.86">bill passed by the end of July before</text>
  <text start="1175.48" dur="5.49">they went on summer break I was asked by</text>

  <text start="1199.78" dur="5.7">empowerment talk and the wellness target</text>
  <text start="1202.15" dur="5.97">and then I get into Obamacare and this</text>
  <text start="1205.48" dur="4.47">was kind of scary because the sit in the</text>
  <text start="1208.12" dur="3.87">room there were a lot of Republicans and</text>
  <text start="1209.95" dur="5.73">all their staff and there was some what</text>

  <text start="1359.919" dur="7.081">thinking malignant hazardous and it hit</text>
  <text start="1364.419" dur="4.561">me my mom the teacher the the history</text>
  <text start="1367" dur="3.09">teacher and I looked at the congressman</text>
  <text start="1368.98" dur="2.37">I said congressman if you&amp;#39;re asked the</text>
  <text start="1370.09" dur="6.98">word what&amp;#39;s the one word to describe</text>
  <text start="1371.35" dur="12.02">Obamacare the me the word is fascist</text>
  <text start="1377.07" dur="10.3">well Dustin it got out what I said and</text>
  <text start="1383.37" dur="8.14">was there a torrent of criticism</text>
  <text start="1387.37" dur="6.45">directed at me and nine years later a</text>
  <text start="1391.51" dur="5.07">nine and a half years later because I</text>
  <text start="1393.82" dur="5.28">was in July my own that quite the half</text>
  <text start="1396.58" dur="5.94">but July of 2009 I stand behind that</text>
  <text start="1399.1" dur="7.35">statement hmm you see that misnomer is</text>
  <text start="1402.52" dur="7.409">Obamacare was hazardous was was dilatory</text>
  <text start="1406.45" dur="5.82">us to the insurance industry if you look</text>
  <text start="1409.929" dur="4.021">at the stock prices record prices record</text>
  <text start="1412.27" dur="3.21">profit right if you look at the stock</text>
  <text start="1413.95" dur="3.359">prices of insurance companies in</text>
  <text start="1415.48" dur="4.41">February 2009 when the first part of</text>
  <text start="1417.309" dur="5.101">Obamacare passed and you look at their</text>
  <text start="1419.89" dur="4.46">stock prices now it&amp;#39;s about a seven</text>
  <text start="1422.41" dur="3.92">hundred eight hundred percent increase</text>
  <text start="1424.35" dur="4.36">well there&amp;#39;s a reason for that</text>
  <text start="1426.33" dur="6.19">it was a huge windfall the insurance</text>
  <text start="1428.71" dur="9.87">industry wrote Obamacare there are</text>
  <text start="1432.52" dur="9.659">active players so when it comes to</text>
  <text start="1438.58" dur="6.479">political support of health care freedom</text>
  <text start="1442.179" dur="5.191">I believe there was</text>
  <text start="1445.059" dur="6.96">some political support of empowerment</text>
  <text start="1447.37" dur="7.019">noodles as far back as 1988 but I</text>
  <text start="1452.019" dur="6.051">believe that support essentially</text>
  <text start="1454.389" dur="9.36">evaporated now that brings us to trump</text>
  <text start="1458.07" dur="8.89">that&amp;#39;s my question yeah right so I have</text>
  <text start="1463.749" dur="6.241">been supportive of Trump on many fronts</text>
  <text start="1466.96" dur="6.839">because I truly believe he is intent on</text>
  <text start="1469.99" dur="7.559">taking down what I call the Rothschild</text>
  <text start="1473.799" dur="5.641">Rockefeller silo of globalist hmm that</text>
  <text start="1477.549" dur="5.13">doesn&amp;#39;t mean he I do believe he might</text>
  <text start="1479.44" dur="5.25">have some ties to some globalist but not</text>
  <text start="1482.679" dur="4.021">in that Rothschild rockefeller axis that</text>
  <text start="1484.69" dur="5.969">is so evil that has destroyed our</text>
  <text start="1486.7" dur="6.63">country over many decades time but when</text>
  <text start="1490.659" dur="4.86">it comes to health care he has done some</text>
  <text start="1493.33" dur="5.669">really good things about getting rid of</text>
  <text start="1495.519" dur="6.78">the mandates yet of putting he just did</text>
  <text start="1498.999" dur="5.52">a put out an executive order where you</text>
  <text start="1502.299" dur="5.01">can now have short term insurance</text>
  <text start="1504.519" dur="5.071">policies that go 12 months and can go</text>
  <text start="1507.309" dur="4.62">back to back to back and drastically</text>
  <text start="1509.59" dur="4.919">reduced the cost of insurance for folks</text>
  <text start="1511.929" dur="5.34">by 80% he&amp;#39;s done some really good things</text>
  <text start="1514.509" dur="5.37">where I got concerned with the president</text>
  <text start="1517.269" dur="4.89">and this is actually I think aggravated</text>
  <text start="1519.879" dur="5.91">some folks in his administration is when</text>
  <text start="1522.159" dur="6.301">Paul Ryan had put his program up as the</text>
  <text start="1525.789" dur="5.58">one that&amp;#39;s gonna be the alternative when</text>
  <text start="1528.46" dur="4.349">I read it it became very obvious to me</text>
  <text start="1531.369" dur="4.621">it was essentially a watered-down</text>
  <text start="1532.809" dur="4.891">Obamacare no was that surprising no cuz</text>
  <text start="1535.99" dur="3.529">all you have to do is look where Paul</text>
  <text start="1537.7" dur="5.64">Ryan has gotten his money over the years</text>
  <text start="1539.519" dur="8.62">he gets huge money from Big Pharma big</text>
  <text start="1543.34" dur="8.25">insurance his wife my research shows</text>
  <text start="1548.139" dur="7.17">that she was a lobbyist for the big</text>
  <text start="1551.59" dur="6.689">health care insurance industry so it</text>
  <text start="1555.309" dur="5.641">really so when I when it when all of a</text>
  <text start="1558.279" dur="3.63">sudden he started to get behind well we</text>
  <text start="1560.95" dur="2.819">have to do something</text>
  <text start="1561.909" dur="4.02">yeah I agree we have to do something on</text>
  <text start="1563.769" dur="3.78">the other hand let&amp;#39;s not think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1565.929" dur="3.96">doing something when in fact we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1567.549" dur="5.941">right yeah they keep that Overton Window</text>
  <text start="1569.889" dur="6.48">and a very small yes they surely do and</text>
  <text start="1573.49" dur="4.889">and I think again that&amp;#39;s Big Pharma and</text>
  <text start="1576.369" dur="2.651">big insurance pushing in from the sides</text>
  <text start="1578.379" dur="3.691">to keep</text>
  <text start="1579.02" dur="6.75">that to keep that window tight right and</text>
  <text start="1582.07" dur="7.66">so so Trump has made some progress in</text>
  <text start="1585.77" dur="6.78">enhancing folks healthcare freedom but</text>
  <text start="1589.73" dur="7.11">we still have a significant ways to go</text>
  <text start="1592.55" dur="9.66">and the key thing the absolute key thing</text>
  <text start="1596.84" dur="10.92">is that Obamacare Obamacare needs to</text>
  <text start="1602.21" dur="8.67">completely be ripped out by every route</text>
  <text start="1607.76" dur="6.51">that remains mm-hmm and salted the earth</text>
  <text start="1610.88" dur="6.12">needs to be salted yes yeah and and</text>
  <text start="1614.27" dur="9.78">that&amp;#39;s not an overstate yeah because the</text>
  <text start="1617" dur="8.09">crux of Obamacare is control they it was</text>
  <text start="1624.05" dur="5.19">a Trojan horse</text>
  <text start="1625.09" dur="7.27">they used health care as a means of</text>
  <text start="1629.24" dur="7.55">getting control of every person family</text>
  <text start="1632.36" dur="8.76">and business in our country and and</text>
  <text start="1636.79" dur="9.88">stripping freedom and liberty and there</text>
  <text start="1641.12" dur="9.33">are many people in Congress mark Meadows</text>
  <text start="1646.67" dur="7.71">comes to mind from from the freedom</text>
  <text start="1650.45" dur="8.22">caucus Jim Jeffers who have been</text>
  <text start="1654.38" dur="7.14">supportive of these health care freedom</text>
  <text start="1658.67" dur="6.63">options that we were discussing thirty</text>
  <text start="1661.52" dur="7.41">years ago and the hope is with the</text>
  <text start="1665.3" dur="7.38">midterm elections we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="1668.93" dur="7.23">people leave Washington a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1672.68" dur="5.1">that it&amp;#39;s actually kind of surprising</text>
  <text start="1676.16" dur="5.01">that they&amp;#39;re not running for re-election</text>
  <text start="1677.78" dur="5.19">or they&amp;#39;re not moving from the house to</text>
  <text start="1681.17" dur="3.81">the Senate in races right there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1682.97" dur="3.18">just taking a powder good example Paul</text>
  <text start="1684.98" dur="5.76">Ryan yeah</text>
  <text start="1686.15" dur="8.7">and record resignations record right in</text>
  <text start="1690.74" dur="5.82">the house and in the Senate I do believe</text>
  <text start="1694.85" dur="5.1">this is part of Trump&amp;#39;s draining the</text>
  <text start="1696.56" dur="11.52">swamp okay I believe these people were</text>
  <text start="1699.95" dur="11.75">told it&amp;#39;s time for you leave because you</text>
  <text start="1708.08" dur="7.1">know what if not</text>
  <text start="1711.7" dur="5.46">things might not go so well and I and I</text>
  <text start="1715.18" dur="3.51">and I truly believe that this is part of</text>
  <text start="1717.16" dur="4.55">draining the swamp and it gets us into</text>
  <text start="1718.69" dur="6.53">an issue that you and I&amp;#39;ve discussed</text>
  <text start="1721.71" dur="7.12">that a lot of people are very frustrated</text>
  <text start="1725.22" dur="5.53">many of I know folks that come to my</text>
  <text start="1728.83" dur="3.6">website Dave Jenna calm or listen to my</text>
  <text start="1730.75" dur="3.87">radio show operation freedom I&amp;#39;m sure</text>

  <text start="1744.01" dur="8.28">you</text>
  <text start="1744.43" dur="13.68">and so do i but we have to make sure</text>
  <text start="1752.29" dur="8.25">that the foundation is solid when it</text>
  <text start="1758.11" dur="4.62">comes to the rule of law to the legal</text>
  <text start="1760.54" dur="4.32">system to the judicial system you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1762.73" dur="3.69">go after Hillary when call me still I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1764.86" dur="3.72">gonna be the one that investigates her</text>
  <text start="1766.42" dur="4.32">not read write I mean just look there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1768.58" dur="3.42">been a recognized Ignatians from the</text>
  <text start="1770.74" dur="3.33">house and said recognize our</text>
  <text start="1772" dur="4.56">resignations from the Department of</text>
  <text start="1774.07" dur="5.64">Justice and the FBI and firings yeah</text>
  <text start="1776.56" dur="5.19">right so so this is all part of draining</text>
  <text start="1779.71" dur="5.91">the swamp this isn&amp;#39;t this is setting the</text>
  <text start="1781.75" dur="6.99">battlefield so as frustrated as everyone</text>
  <text start="1785.62" dur="5.12">is they need to realize these globalists</text>
  <text start="1788.74" dur="6">have been in power for many many decades</text>
  <text start="1790.74" dur="5.44">with very very deep roots in I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1794.74" dur="6.12">even actually call it a swamp I call it</text>
  <text start="1796.18" dur="6.9">a septic tank and and what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1800.86" dur="7.56">is that by removal of some of these</text>
  <text start="1803.08" dur="7.38">people some of these low-level puppets</text>
  <text start="1808.42" dur="3.54">not even middle level I consider the</text>
  <text start="1810.46" dur="5.34">bushes and the Clintons in the Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1811.96" dur="6.03">and the soros is the middle level but</text>
  <text start="1815.8" dur="6.69">the removal of these lower level puppets</text>
  <text start="1817.99" dur="8.16">is crucial and to and the key right now</text>
  <text start="1822.49" dur="5.67">is restitution of the rule of law and I</text>
  <text start="1826.15" dur="5.48">think we&amp;#39;re seeing that and and and</text>
  <text start="1828.16" dur="6.75">we&amp;#39;re seeing that with a huge number of</text>
  <text start="1831.63" dur="5.23">new judges being appointed mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="1834.91" dur="3.33">you know everybody gives McConnell grief</text>
  <text start="1836.86" dur="3.12">I get it I mean there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="1838.24" dur="2.73">things that he I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="1839.98" dur="2.55">think he could have been a more</text>
  <text start="1840.97" dur="4.32">effective leader of the Senate on the</text>
  <text start="1842.53" dur="6.36">other hand he kept them in this summer</text>
  <text start="1845.29" dur="7.41">and now what do they have 59 new they</text>
  <text start="1848.89" dur="5.16">just did a number of approvals last</text>
  <text start="1852.7" dur="2.94">night and they have more to come I think</text>
  <text start="1854.05" dur="4.29">you said another 40 yeah they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1855.64" dur="7.65">accordion it up midterms yeah so we have</text>
  <text start="1858.34" dur="9.3">59 new federal district court judges 23</text>
  <text start="1863.29" dur="8.07">or 53 federal district court judge 20 or</text>
  <text start="1867.64" dur="7.35">59 and fit 23 appeals court judges two</text>
  <text start="1871.36" dur="9.51">Supreme Court justices and and that gets</text>
  <text start="1874.99" dur="7.53">us into this domino theory right the</text>
  <text start="1880.87" dur="4.71">first domino I believe is this</text>
  <text start="1882.52" dur="6.24">restitution of or in restoration of the</text>
  <text start="1885.58" dur="4.74">rule of law and you have to have the</text>
  <text start="1888.76" dur="3.6">judges committed to the rule of law</text>
  <text start="1890.32" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re gonna be there when you bring</text>
  <text start="1892.36" dur="5.55">these people in mmm so as much as I</text>
  <text start="1895.06" dur="5.94">wanted to see John Brennan James clapper</text>
  <text start="1897.91" dur="6.09">Hillary Clinton James Comey all these</text>
  <text start="1901" dur="6.63">players no Loretta Lynch Eric Holder in</text>
  <text start="1904" dur="6.27">cuffs in an orange jumpsuit being</text>
  <text start="1907.63" dur="5.1">brought into a court if that would have</text>
  <text start="1910.27" dur="3.15">happened six months ago no so what would</text>
  <text start="1912.73" dur="2.31">have happened</text>
  <text start="1913.42" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;d have walked mayor you know what</text>
  <text start="1915.04" dur="3.78">argument and they would have walked they</text>
  <text start="1916.93" dur="4.8">would have walked they would have walked</text>
  <text start="1918.82" dur="4.23">or if there would have been some ruling</text>
  <text start="1921.73" dur="3.72">against them it would have been appealed</text>
  <text start="1923.05" dur="5.45">for some reason to an expedited basis to</text>
  <text start="1925.45" dur="5.61">the Supreme Court and they would a lot</text>
  <text start="1928.5" dur="7.05">and and this is why I believe there was</text>
  <text start="1931.06" dur="8.1">such animosity in such desperation</text>
  <text start="1935.55" dur="6.73">thrown at the Kavanagh at the Kavanagh</text>
  <text start="1939.16" dur="4.86">hearing at the Kavanagh nomination by</text>
  <text start="1942.28" dur="3.66">the deep state by the globalist</text>
  <text start="1944.02" dur="3.66">syndicate you can just look at how</text>

  <text start="1977.29" dur="5.13">White House for the bush I mean</text>
  <text start="1979.06" dur="6.39">but here&amp;#39;s what I I i believe i believe</text>
  <text start="1982.42" dur="9.02">that when Trump had his interview with</text>
  <text start="1985.45" dur="10.86">Kavanagh I believe Kavanagh assured</text>
  <text start="1991.44" dur="7.12">Trump that not this conservative liberal</text>
  <text start="1996.31" dur="4.86">thing not roe versus wade like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1998.56" dur="6.9">all trying to be I think he committed to</text>
  <text start="2001.17" dur="8.22">Trump about being a solid rule of law</text>
  <text start="2005.46" dur="5.34">justice and that&amp;#39;s why I think Trump</text>
  <text start="2009.39" dur="4.5">continued to back him all the way</text>
  <text start="2010.8" dur="4.91">through because most presidents wonder</text>
  <text start="2013.89" dur="4.41">when a lot of this stuff started Flair</text>
  <text start="2015.71" dur="4.9">even if even even though a lot of it was</text>
  <text start="2018.3" dur="6.83">completely bogus yeah</text>
  <text start="2020.61" dur="7.83">if not all of it so so the first domino</text>
  <text start="2025.13" dur="6.52">was getting these judges in and having a</text>
  <text start="2028.44" dur="5.25">5-4 majority in the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="2031.65" dur="3.78">because as some of these other issues</text>
  <text start="2033.69" dur="3.78">roll out they&amp;#39;re gonna immediately</text>
  <text start="2035.43" dur="4.08">brought up to the Supreme Court and what</text>
  <text start="2037.47" dur="4.11">difference does it make is if you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="2039.51" dur="4.26">a bunch of folks there that are just</text>
  <text start="2041.58" dur="3.06">gonna say goodbye yeah yeah what just</text>
  <text start="2043.77" dur="4.409">keep doing what you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="2044.64" dur="7.11">mm-hmm the second domino is this</text>
  <text start="2048.179" dur="5.581">declassification right</text>
  <text start="2051.75" dur="4.23">yeah that&amp;#39;s coming right and I believe</text>

  <text start="2109.02" dur="3.62">right and there&amp;#39;s a couple pieces of</text>
  <text start="2111.18" dur="5.07">information that have come out</text>
  <text start="2112.64" dur="5.59">through the queue line that you know</text>

  <text start="2131.7" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s not so you can&amp;#39;t term it a little</text>
  <text start="2135.21" dur="5.34">bit every once in a while there might be</text>
  <text start="2137.01" dur="5.43">a little ahead of the game see I mean</text>
  <text start="2140.55" dur="3.39">that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="2142.44" dur="3.21">happen down the line it just hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2143.94" dur="5.85">happened yet but there might be a little</text>
  <text start="2145.65" dur="6.42">bit of misinformation to get the</text>
  <text start="2149.79" dur="3.569">syndicate to play outta hand a different</text>
  <text start="2152.07" dur="2.6">way what a lot of people don&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="2153.359" dur="3.51">about is if you look at the timing</text>
  <text start="2154.67" dur="5.62">November 4th e stuff well what happened</text>
  <text start="2156.869" dur="6.48">on November 5th November 5th that&amp;#39;s when</text>

  <text start="2164.99" dur="9.25">mm-hmm so again my sources have have</text>
  <text start="2171.75" dur="4.65">focused on the fact that this</text>
  <text start="2174.24" dur="4.91">information that&amp;#39;s being presented this</text>
  <text start="2176.4" dur="6.36">line of information through cue has</text>
  <text start="2179.15" dur="4.87">actually been in many times actually</text>
  <text start="2182.76" dur="4.32">ahead of the game</text>
  <text start="2184.02" dur="5.46">oh yeah months sometimes right so a lot</text>
  <text start="2187.08" dur="4.8">of people are saying well yeah you know</text>
  <text start="2189.48" dur="5.09">the Q the Q you know Q said this and it</text>
  <text start="2191.88" dur="6">didn&amp;#39;t happen wait doesn&amp;#39;t mean it whoa</text>
  <text start="2194.57" dur="4.81">give it some time now and there are</text>
  <text start="2197.88" dur="4.14">certain things that have been put in</text>
  <text start="2199.38" dur="5.52">that information where I&amp;#39;ve read it and</text>
  <text start="2202.02" dur="8.3">I interpreted it one way and a source of</text>
  <text start="2204.9" dur="11.4">mine might say look at it this way</text>
  <text start="2210.32" dur="12.34">so we have information that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="2216.3" dur="8.789">provided to us and I don&amp;#39;t think you or</text>
  <text start="2222.66" dur="4.199">anyone associated with Q has ever said</text>
  <text start="2225.089" dur="4.711">you should take it at gospel and you</text>
  <text start="2226.859" dur="5.791">shouldn&amp;#39;t research it yourself mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="2229.8" dur="4.53">right and it&amp;#39;s many times in the</text>
  <text start="2232.65" dur="5.1">research that you actually find out</text>
  <text start="2234.33" dur="7.05">other information that opens other doors</text>
  <text start="2237.75" dur="6.589">for you that brings you back to what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2241.38" dur="5.57">really happening</text>
  <text start="2244.339" dur="6.03">I think what&amp;#39;s really happening is that</text>
  <text start="2246.95" dur="5.73">right now this D classification the</text>
  <text start="2250.369" dur="4.11">classification issue is coming to the</text>
  <text start="2252.68" dur="4.379">forefront declassification issue of the</text>
  <text start="2254.479" dur="5.28">FISA warrants declassification of Comey</text>

  <text start="2265.309" dur="4.081">302 forms that were fill out if they</text>
  <text start="2267.289" dur="4.411">interview it and it&amp;#39;s my understanding</text>
  <text start="2269.39" dur="3.719">from the folks I speak to what this is</text>
  <text start="2271.7" dur="2.879">going to show is when it comes to the</text>
  <text start="2273.109" dur="5.49">FISA warrants that it could be that the</text>
  <text start="2274.579" dur="7.561">first FISA warrant was actually not</text>
  <text start="2278.599" dur="6.541">issued by the Feist was was not approved</text>
  <text start="2282.14" dur="7.589">by all the FISA Court judges that it</text>
  <text start="2285.14" dur="6.3">might have been expedited on a expedited</text>
  <text start="2289.729" dur="3.51">basis by the Attorney General Loretta</text>
  <text start="2291.44" dur="3.99">Lynch who has the power to do that</text>
  <text start="2293.239" dur="4.11">legally so many days yeah she for a week</text>
  <text start="2295.43" dur="4.889">but then when they brought the</text>
  <text start="2297.349" dur="5.22">information to a FISA Court judge what</text>
  <text start="2300.319" dur="4.591">do they bring that Judge they brought</text>
  <text start="2302.569" dur="3.99">the fake Russian dossier and didn&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="2304.91" dur="4.98">that judge that it was paid for by the</text>
  <text start="2306.559" dur="5.341">DNC in the Hillary Clinton campaign yeah</text>
  <text start="2309.89" dur="5.82">but it was still rubber stamped and put</text>
  <text start="2311.9" dur="6.419">into effect as far as the Comey mccabe</text>
  <text start="2315.71" dur="7.769">tax what i&amp;#39;m told is the information</text>
  <text start="2318.319" dur="6.21">there will show active knowing sedition</text>
  <text start="2323.479" dur="3.421">and treason</text>
  <text start="2324.529" dur="3.391">it&amp;#39;s the highest level mentality from</text>
  <text start="2326.9" dur="3.929">the very beginning</text>
  <text start="2327.92" dur="4.679">yeah right and I mean going up into the</text>
  <text start="2330.829" dur="4.71">Obama administration higher than call me</text>
  <text start="2332.599" dur="6.061">a McKay yeah and as far as the Bruce or</text>
  <text start="2335.539" dur="5.52">302 forms what I&amp;#39;ve been told is that</text>
  <text start="2338.66" dur="4.74">the reason why declassification of them</text>
  <text start="2341.059" dur="4.26">is so important is because it will</text>
  <text start="2343.4" dur="3.54">actually show that Bruce or a number</text>
  <text start="2345.319" dur="4.44">four official and Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="2346.94" dur="8.46">under Obama was actively involved in the</text>
  <text start="2349.759" dur="8.421">writing of the fake Russian dossier not</text>
  <text start="2355.4" dur="5.719">just receiving it but actually in</text>
  <text start="2358.18" dur="6.129">writing it and then passed on to steel</text>
  <text start="2361.119" dur="7.781">infusion gps for further editing for</text>
  <text start="2364.309" dur="8.851">further addition of content but what all</text>
  <text start="2368.9" dur="9.06">this shows is the criminality the</text>
  <text start="2373.16" dur="7.11">criminality of an entire administration</text>
  <text start="2377.96" dur="6.6">all the way up with Obama&amp;#39;s knowledge</text>
  <text start="2380.27" dur="6.66">all the way up in the active blocking of</text>
  <text start="2384.56" dur="5.49">a presidential campaign and then once</text>
  <text start="2386.93" dur="5.82">that campaign realized through the</text>
  <text start="2390.05" dur="5.7">election the presidency the active</text>
  <text start="2392.75" dur="5.04">sedition of bringing down a duly elected</text>
  <text start="2395.75" dur="3.48">President of the United States it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2397.79" dur="3.15">gonna destroy the Russian collision</text>
  <text start="2399.23" dur="3.389">delusion and then lead to the</text>
  <text start="2400.94" dur="3.39">investigations into their criminality</text>
  <text start="2402.619" dur="4.261">which will lead to the mass arrests is</text>
  <text start="2404.33" dur="5.4">what I think yeah right and then exactly</text>
  <text start="2406.88" dur="5.91">thus and then that Domino will then fall</text>
  <text start="2409.73" dur="5.9">we&amp;#39;re now all of a sudden Huber this</text>
  <text start="2412.79" dur="6">prosecutor that sessions appointed</text>
  <text start="2415.63" dur="5.11">that&amp;#39;s been doing his work out of Utah</text>

  <text start="2420.74" dur="7.77">reportedly there are these tens of</text>
  <text start="2422.839" dur="7.02">thousands of sealed indictments 57 and I</text>
  <text start="2428.51" dur="4.109">personally believe not all of them will</text>
  <text start="2429.859" dur="4.891">be open yeah I believe some will remain</text>
  <text start="2432.619" dur="4.891">closed but you&amp;#39;ll see people leaving</text>
  <text start="2434.75" dur="5.099">their positions and we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="2437.51" dur="4.41">that as we outlined in Congress I think</text>
  <text start="2439.849" dur="4.531">more we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot business we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2441.92" dur="4.47">seeing a lot out of Hollywood and it</text>
  <text start="2444.38" dur="4.5">could be that some of these folks are</text>
  <text start="2446.39" dur="6.209">involved in more financial crimes than</text>
  <text start="2448.88" dur="6.87">they are some of the more onerous human</text>
  <text start="2452.599" dur="6.181">trafficking type of issues these are</text>
  <text start="2455.75" dur="5.07">folks that are being allowed to you</text>
  <text start="2458.78" dur="6">leave you get out of Dodge you hand over</text>
  <text start="2460.82" dur="5.88">evidence on people above you and you</text>
  <text start="2464.78" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t get a jail out a free card but in</text>
  <text start="2466.7" dur="5.52">a way you do and you just go live your</text>
  <text start="2469.52" dur="5.55">life and get out of here mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="2472.22" dur="4.619">I think that as this domino of the</text>
  <text start="2475.07" dur="4.62">declassification Falls what&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2476.839" dur="4.651">happen is we&amp;#39;re gonna see the Huber side</text>
  <text start="2479.69" dur="5.76">come in and then we&amp;#39;re also gonna see</text>
  <text start="2481.49" dur="5.79">the military tribunal side yep and and</text>
  <text start="2485.45" dur="4.23">many people believe that&amp;#39;s conspiracy</text>
  <text start="2487.28" dur="4.74">theory and and that it&amp;#39;s not gonna come</text>
  <text start="2489.68" dur="3.99">into effect I believe it is all the</text>
  <text start="2492.02" dur="2.97">other steps are falling into place and</text>
  <text start="2493.67" dur="3.24">it makes sense and they&amp;#39;re gonna sweep</text>
  <text start="2494.99" dur="4.49">up the midterms at the same time so all</text>
  <text start="2496.91" dur="5.58">of this is going to come out right then</text>
  <text start="2499.48" dur="4.72">you know plus I think some of the recent</text>
  <text start="2502.49" dur="5.01">moves by Trump they just announced that</text>
  <text start="2504.2" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re gonna have a marijuana federal</text>

  <text start="2520.01" dur="3.51">cleaning up the oceans now that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2522.109" dur="3.21">pull in a lot of the environmentally</text>
  <text start="2523.52" dur="3.839">conscious people on the left so he is</text>
  <text start="2525.319" dur="4.05">hitting them at every level right at</text>

  <text start="2537.53" dur="9.42">making them panic yeah you know and so</text>
  <text start="2542.38" dur="6.04">and what really I think led to the panic</text>
  <text start="2546.95" dur="4.409">when it came to Kavanagh and the</text>

  <text start="3411.41" dur="9.54">propaganda arm for decades I&amp;#39;ll give you</text>
  <text start="3419.15" dur="5.55">one little example about the propaganda</text>
  <text start="3420.95" dur="5.55">back in 88 I was at a meeting in the</text>
  <text start="3424.7" dur="4.35">White House and it was about domestic</text>
  <text start="3426.5" dur="6.869">policy issues it was the first time I</text>
  <text start="3429.05" dur="5.069">had been involved in that and we were</text>
  <text start="3433.369" dur="3.061">talking about a number of different</text>
  <text start="3434.119" dur="3.72">issues and then I went back to my hotel</text>
  <text start="3436.43" dur="3.57">that evening because the meeting was</text>
  <text start="3437.839" dur="3.811">going to go to the next day and I turned</text>
  <text start="3440" dur="2.309">on the news and this is probably long</text>
  <text start="3441.65" dur="2.52">before your</text>
  <text start="3442.309" dur="4.92">but when I when I turned on the news it</text>
  <text start="3444.17" dur="5.73">was Tom Brokaw and then BC and at one</text>
  <text start="3447.229" dur="3.901">point he starts talking about about</text>
  <text start="3449.9" dur="4.98">something that we discussed at this</text>
  <text start="3451.13" dur="5.28">meeting and at the meeting it was and he</text>
  <text start="3454.88" dur="4.439">starts talking about it and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3456.41" dur="4.919">hundred and eighty degrees I mean a</text>
  <text start="3459.319" dur="7.28">hundred and eighty degrees complete flip</text>
  <text start="3461.329" dur="8.13">of what was actually decided okay no wow</text>
  <text start="3466.599" dur="4.6">whoever fed him that information and the</text>
  <text start="3469.459" dur="2.971">White House did a really bad job so I</text>
  <text start="3471.199" dur="3.12">turned the channel and it was that a no</text>
  <text start="3472.43" dur="2.97">Peter Jennings or whoever was on ABC and</text>
  <text start="3474.319" dur="3">it was the same thing</text>
  <text start="3475.4" dur="3.689">the Brokaw just said 180 degrees</text>
  <text start="3477.319" dur="4.65">different oh that&amp;#39;s bad so I turned it</text>
  <text start="3479.089" dur="5.76">over to CBS Rather and he&amp;#39;s same thing</text>
  <text start="3481.969" dur="4.171">okay so the next day I go back to this</text>
  <text start="3484.849" dur="3.39">meeting twice I said before it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3486.14" dur="4.889">starting it and I go I have uh I have</text>
  <text start="3488.239" dur="5.34">I&amp;#39;d like to bring something up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3491.029" dur="4.29">like well sure Dave what I go whoa so</text>
  <text start="3493.579" dur="4.44">last night I go back to the hotel and I</text>
  <text start="3495.319" dur="4.05">was watching the network news and I</text>
  <text start="3498.019" dur="2.79">switched from the three channels and</text>
  <text start="3499.369" dur="4.5">they talked about something that we</text>
  <text start="3500.809" dur="4.26">spoke about here yesterday but they all</text>
  <text start="3503.869" dur="5.07">had it a hundred and eighty degrees</text>
  <text start="3505.069" dur="6.811">different it was completely flipped okay</text>
  <text start="3508.939" dur="6.11">so what was black was mentioned as being</text>
  <text start="3511.88" dur="5.579">white I mean it was just 180 degrees I</text>
  <text start="3515.049" dur="4.45">said so we need to call somebody from</text>
  <text start="3517.459" dur="3.72">the Communications Office and get them</text>
  <text start="3519.499" dur="4.171">down here to straighten that out and</text>
  <text start="3521.179" dur="5.55">make sure that they&amp;#39;re better preventing</text>
  <text start="3523.67" dur="6.419">presenting this information Dustin they</text>
  <text start="3526.729" dur="4.8">all start laughing at me okay and and</text>

  <text start="3539.479" dur="5.34">lesson to you newbie that whatever you</text>
  <text start="3541.549" dur="6.27">see out there if you flip it you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3544.819" dur="4.92">closer to the truth yeah that was back</text>
  <text start="3547.819" dur="4.081">in 1988 and I think it&amp;#39;s only gotten</text>
  <text start="3549.739" dur="4.171">worse from there yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3551.9" dur="3.329">reliable you know metric at this point</text>
  <text start="3553.91" dur="3.889">it&amp;#39;s to the opposite of what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3555.229" dur="6.6">saying they they have been manipulating</text>
  <text start="3557.799" dur="5.861">the truth for so long and and this is</text>
  <text start="3561.829" dur="3.45">what&amp;#39;s so valuable what you do as I</text>

  <text start="3568.91" dur="4.589">this is why getting the information out</text>
  <text start="3571.279" dur="4.501">what you do what I try to do with my</text>
  <text start="3573.499" dur="5.641">platform and what a number of</text>
  <text start="3575.78" dur="4.8">other people did is so important not</text>
  <text start="3579.14" dur="2.85">that they should research what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3580.58" dur="3.51">speaking about not that they should do</text>
  <text start="3581.99" dur="5.4">their own due diligence and and and and</text>
  <text start="3584.09" dur="6.84">but but they need to they should but</text>
  <text start="3587.39" dur="11.37">this alternative media is actually I</text>
  <text start="3590.93" dur="12.69">believe really harmed the agenda of the</text>
  <text start="3598.76" dur="7.38">deep state yeah and and and I believe</text>
  <text start="3603.62" dur="5.58">will actually lead to the death knell of</text>
  <text start="3606.14" dur="4.59">the deep state I think that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="3609.2" dur="4.53">whole cue thing will originally was</text>
  <text start="3610.73" dur="5.34">about was to build up or organize</text>
  <text start="3613.73" dur="4.17">resistance instead of just all of these</text>
  <text start="3616.07" dur="5.01">you know truthers being islands to</text>
  <text start="3617.9" dur="5.76">themselves against the propaganda arm of</text>
  <text start="3621.08" dur="4.47">the you know the deep state the MSM I</text>
  <text start="3623.66" dur="3.66">agree with that very well and we</text>
  <text start="3625.55" dur="3.24">destroyed it I mean it&amp;#39;s gone it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="3633.14" dur="4.94">fringe left very true</text>
  <text start="3638.41" dur="4.54">well it have we covered the main things</text>
  <text start="3641.81" dur="2.76">I know there&amp;#39;s so many things we could</text>
  <text start="3642.95" dur="5.97">talk about if we go too long I want to</text>
  <text start="3644.57" dur="5.64">watch it no I know III unless there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3648.92" dur="3.69">something else you&amp;#39;d like to bring up I</text>
  <text start="3650.21" dur="4.17">think the key thing is a domino theory I</text>
  <text start="3652.61" dur="4.2">think the key thing is folks to realize</text>
  <text start="3654.38" dur="4.2">that that the alternative media is</text>
  <text start="3656.81" dur="2.82">really important but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>

  <text start="3659.63" dur="4.23">diligence yeah knowing yourself is kind</text>
  <text start="3662.12" dur="3.3">of what Q is all about I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3663.86" dur="3.03">all about teaching people to do their</text>
  <text start="3665.42" dur="2.64">research and think for themselves and</text>
  <text start="3666.89" dur="3.24">come to that knowing through the</text>

  <text start="3894.91" dur="7.06">underestimated the effect and then talk</text>
  <text start="3899.66" dur="3.72">to one of these physicians when a new</text>

  <text start="3941.24" dur="4.74">hope that as we these dominoes fall one</text>
  <text start="3944.09" dur="7.62">of the next dominoes that will fall as</text>
  <text start="3945.98" dur="8.81">the syndicate is decapitated is a free</text>
  <text start="3951.71" dur="5.61">market a true free market approach an</text>
  <text start="3954.79" dur="5.5">empowerment approach to individuals with</text>
  <text start="3957.32" dur="6.2">prevention and wellness initiatives when</text>
  <text start="3960.29" dur="5.64">it comes to the folks healthcare yeah</text>
  <text start="3963.52" dur="5.5">nothing is quite so unhealthy as the</text>
  <text start="3965.93" dur="4.92">government healthcare program no and you</text>
  <text start="3969.02" dur="3.66">know one of the in my training I did my</text>
  <text start="3970.85" dur="3.6">fellowship in Canada so after I was done</text>
  <text start="3972.68" dur="3.18">with medical school I did a residency in</text>
  <text start="3974.45" dur="2.52">orthopedic surgery at the University of</text>
  <text start="3975.86" dur="3.09">Michigan and</text>
  <text start="3976.97" dur="4.59">than did a fellowship at the inn in</text>
  <text start="3978.95" dur="3.87">London Ontario Canada and I went up</text>
  <text start="3981.56" dur="3.36">there to do a fellowship in sports</text>
  <text start="3982.82" dur="4.47">medicine and shoulder reconstructive</text>
  <text start="3984.92" dur="6.33">surgery and the like and I did that but</text>
  <text start="3987.29" dur="7.38">here&amp;#39;s where my fellowship actually I</text>
  <text start="3991.25" dur="6.18">learned so much more than that and that</text>
  <text start="3994.67" dur="8.939">was on health care policy because it was</text>
  <text start="3997.43" dur="7.919">my initiation into a national health</text>
  <text start="4003.609" dur="4.831">care program now I had some of it after</text>
  <text start="4005.349" dur="4.561">working in a VA not because a VA is a</text>
  <text start="4008.44" dur="4.2">more of a national health care delivery</text>
  <text start="4009.91" dur="4.53">approach and it&amp;#39;s horrendous the care in</text>
  <text start="4012.64" dur="4.77">spite of a lot of good people that work</text>
  <text start="4014.44" dur="5.31">in the system the foundation the system</text>
  <text start="4017.41" dur="6.12">is just terrible I hear terrible things</text>
  <text start="4019.75" dur="6.41">about these lines and quality yeah now</text>
  <text start="4023.53" dur="6.839">the waiting times are incredible and and</text>
  <text start="4026.16" dur="5.62">the quality of care that&amp;#39;s received for</text>
  <text start="4030.369" dur="4.011">people that have fought for our country</text>
  <text start="4031.78" dur="6.48">and our freedoms and our liberties it is</text>
  <text start="4034.38" dur="7.57">it&amp;#39;s sad to see but when I was up in</text>
  <text start="4038.26" dur="5.82">Canada I got a whole different education</text>
  <text start="4041.95" dur="5.84">about a national health care approach</text>
  <text start="4044.08" dur="7.32">and there are some very very good people</text>
  <text start="4047.79" dur="5.89">in Canada taking care of people and they</text>
  <text start="4051.4" dur="5.07">do a wonderful job in spite not because</text>
  <text start="4053.68" dur="4.56">of but in spite of the system but it</text>
  <text start="4056.47" dur="3.99">could became very very obvious to me</text>
  <text start="4058.24" dur="4.14">that the way the system was built was on</text>
  <text start="4060.46" dur="3.389">the most unethical inhumane means of</text>
  <text start="4062.38" dur="7.229">cutting health care costs and that was</text>
  <text start="4063.849" dur="8.101">the ration denying of care and at that</text>
  <text start="4069.609" dur="7.401">point my take-home lesson was I can</text>
  <text start="4071.95" dur="5.06">never allow this to happen in my country</text>
  <text start="4077.07" dur="8.32">ya know in a way I failed because we do</text>
  <text start="4082.599" dur="4.681">see that with the advent of Obamacare</text>
  <text start="4085.39" dur="4.469">and its continuation it is a ration</text>
  <text start="4087.28" dur="5.13">based program we&amp;#39;ve gone very far down</text>
  <text start="4089.859" dur="4.111">the socialism collectivism spectrum we</text>
  <text start="4092.41" dur="5.07">have and every most people are unaware</text>
  <text start="4093.97" dur="5.24">of that but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="4097.48" dur="4.47">at a point where it can&amp;#39;t be changed and</text>
  <text start="4099.21" dur="4.93">I truly believe as these dominoes fall</text>
  <text start="4101.95" dur="3.9">and we get a reset of the rule of law</text>
  <text start="4104.14" dur="4.199">and a reset of the financial system</text>
  <text start="4105.85" dur="4.94">I truly believe one of the next systems</text>
  <text start="4108.339" dur="4.491">that&amp;#39;s going to fall is a reset of the</text>
  <text start="4110.79" dur="4.92">your delivery system which I believe</text>
  <text start="4112.83" dur="4.56">will be more focused on on free market</text>
  <text start="4115.71" dur="3.48">of free market a true free market</text>
  <text start="4117.39" dur="4.8">approach which is something we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="4119.19" dur="5.64">had in this country I was very</text>
  <text start="4122.19" dur="4.56">encouraged by Bayer having successfully</text>
  <text start="4124.83" dur="3.63">been sued over the glyphosate or</text>
  <text start="4126.75" dur="4.35">glyphosate I don&amp;#39;t not to pronounce it</text>
  <text start="4128.46" dur="4.26">but you know a guy got a couple million</text>

  <text start="4134.819" dur="5.821">opened the door yeah right</text>
  <text start="4136.98" dur="5.01">it opened the door and I was - it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="4140.64" dur="3.54">surprise that happened under Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4141.99" dur="4.11">watch I&amp;#39;m sure I don&amp;#39;t think it would</text>
  <text start="4144.18" dur="7.139">have happened under a bush or Clinton or</text>

  <text start="4156.75" dur="3.839">stopped vaccines</text>
  <text start="4157.71" dur="4.26">you know why this why that I think it</text>
  <text start="4160.589" dur="3.361">all comes back down to draining the</text>
  <text start="4161.97" dur="3.21">swamp first and then everything else as</text>
  <text start="4163.95" dur="2.82">you say the dominoes will fall into</text>
  <text start="4165.18" dur="3.77">place it&amp;#39;ll be very quick at that point</text>
  <text start="4166.77" dur="5.4">with them out of the way</text>
  <text start="4168.95" dur="6">III agree with you you know I it&amp;#39;s like</text>

  <text start="4186.27" dur="5.06">satellite lesions mm-hmm and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4189.27" dur="5.13">what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="4191.33" dur="6.28">the swamp draining the swamp is the</text>
  <text start="4194.4" dur="6.36">primary tumor the real cost root cause</text>
  <text start="4197.61" dur="6.3">and once you devoid because let&amp;#39;s face</text>
  <text start="4200.76" dur="7.53">it once you&amp;#39;d avoid the satellite</text>
  <text start="4203.91" dur="6.33">lesions whether it&amp;#39;s 5g or whatever</text>

  <text start="4210.24" dur="5.91">vaccinations whatever it might be</text>
  <text start="4213.02" dur="8.47">once you do take that primary tumor and</text>
  <text start="4216.15" dur="9.09">remove it the satellite lesions lose</text>
  <text start="4221.49" dur="5.84">their powerhouse and part of the</text>
  <text start="4225.24" dur="6.24">powerhouse with these is the money and</text>
  <text start="4227.33" dur="6.34">once you rip that swamp apart or the</text>
  <text start="4231.48" dur="4.95">septic tank as I call what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="4233.67" dur="4.41">happen here is the satellite lesions are</text>
  <text start="4236.43" dur="5.1">going to fold very quickly just as you</text>
