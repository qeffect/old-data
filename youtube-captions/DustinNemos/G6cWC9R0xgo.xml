  <text start="716.27" dur="3.9">wants to talk about it but I see it is</text>
  <text start="717.8" dur="5.58">not that important I mean this is more</text>
  <text start="720.17" dur="4.17">on the drama end of of stuff I want to</text>
  <text start="723.38" dur="4.17">focus on the mission</text>
  <text start="724.34" dur="4.89">I disagree with core see I can</text>
  <text start="727.55" dur="5.4">understand his impatience I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="729.23" dur="5.85">he has insider knowledge and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="732.95" dur="3.63">know if Q&amp;#39;s post about profiting was</text>
  <text start="735.08" dur="4.77">directed at core see I know everybody</text>
  <text start="736.58" dur="5.01">else seems to think that I mean I see is</text>
  <text start="739.85" dur="6.74">people if somebody isn&amp;#39;t that worth and</text>
  <text start="741.59" dur="7.89">and everything just all over the Twitter</text>
  <text start="746.59" dur="6.31">well Nunez is basically saying sessions</text>
  <text start="749.48" dur="6.09">is stonewalling and is not being quick</text>
  <text start="752.9" dur="5.13">enough to provide evidence and</text>
  <text start="755.57" dur="5.69">information that&amp;#39;s requested so Nunez is</text>
  <text start="758.03" dur="6.33">saying he&amp;#39;s gonna call sessions into</text>
  <text start="761.26" dur="5.02">contempt of Congress this is a great</text>
  <text start="764.36" dur="3.78">thing this is amazing because even it</text>
  <text start="766.28" dur="3.39">okay so if Q is right and we should</text>
  <text start="768.14" dur="3.54">trust sessions and he&amp;#39;s this silent</text>
  <text start="769.67" dur="4.17">executioner well he was running out of</text>
  <text start="771.68" dur="4.85">time he needs to get something and we</text>
  <text start="773.84" dur="6.9">need to see some scalps at this point</text>
  <text start="776.53" dur="6.85">and I think this will force the sessions</text>
  <text start="780.74" dur="5.4">card to either be played or be shown to</text>
  <text start="783.38" dur="3.96">be a fraud so something is gonna happen</text>
  <text start="786.14" dur="4.07">with session two one way or the other</text>
  <text start="787.34" dur="2.87">soon</text>
  <text start="796.29" dur="3.51">I am addressing of course see I just</text>
  <text start="798.63" dur="3.03">don&amp;#39;t want to keep addressing it you</text>
  <text start="799.8" dur="3.98">know let&amp;#39;s wait till everybody gets in</text>
  <text start="801.66" dur="5.05">here and then we&amp;#39;ll do it once more</text>
  <text start="803.78" dur="4.4">[Music]</text>
  <text start="806.71" dur="3.78">as I&amp;#39;ve already talked about it like</text>
  <text start="808.18" dur="4.7">three or four times new people keep</text>
  <text start="810.49" dur="2.39">asking</text>
  <text start="813.57" dur="9">oh yeah she keeps slipping she&amp;#39;s away</text>
  <text start="815.699" dur="8.541">blow wiggle but come here there we go</text>

  <text start="824.24" dur="4.969">they&amp;#39;re your YouTube star</text>
  <text start="830.2" dur="2.629">so</text>
  <text start="832.98" dur="4.56">I don&amp;#39;t know about sessions holding back</text>
  <text start="834.959" dur="4.62">evidence for a secret grand jury he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="837.54" dur="3.989">not giving Nunez the stuff that he needs</text>
  <text start="839.579" dur="7.651">to actually progress this this thing</text>
  <text start="841.529" dur="7.62">into justice so I picked Nunez aside if</text>
  <text start="847.23" dur="5.21">it comes down to Nunez versus sessions I</text>
  <text start="849.149" dur="3.291">mean Nunez has been tireless</text>
  <text start="856.12" dur="4.11">yeah McCain suddenly is dying whereas</text>
  <text start="858.73" dur="4.02">before he was recovering and writing a</text>
  <text start="860.23" dur="3.69">book and meeting with foreign terrorists</text>
  <text start="862.75" dur="2.7">and I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="863.92" dur="5.07">with McCain that seems really sudden to</text>
  <text start="865.45" dur="5.67">me maybe he just got some bad news about</text>
  <text start="868.99" dur="5.09">going to Gitmo and he&amp;#39;s like yeah I give</text>
  <text start="871.12" dur="2.96">up let the cancer one</text>
  <text start="883.079" dur="6.641">you had hiccups so what do you guys</text>
  <text start="888.279" dur="2.851">think about this Kanye thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="889.72" dur="8.179">going on that&amp;#39;s what really has me</text>
  <text start="891.13" dur="9.78">excited if Q is waiting for some sort of</text>
  <text start="897.899" dur="4.901">like a percentage marker of the</text>
  <text start="900.91" dur="5.04">population being in support of what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="902.8" dur="7.849">doing then you know we just got a couple</text>
  <text start="905.95" dur="4.699">more percentage points thanks to Kanye</text>
  <text start="914.48" dur="6.27">for better or worse guys I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="917.69" dur="5.61">happened with Corsi has created a shift</text>
  <text start="920.75" dur="4.709">or schism and it&amp;#39;s gonna be very</text>
  <text start="923.3" dur="4.26">decisive people on this side are not</text>
  <text start="925.459" dur="3.481">gonna trust Corsi at all any more people</text>
