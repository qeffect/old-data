  <text start="60.69" dur="4.74">from our sponsors there was a time when</text>
  <text start="63.15" dur="4.71">I had my head in the sand then I found</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="5.4">out that powered players pass lies for</text>
  <text start="67.86" dur="5.67">truth and truth for the lies especially</text>

  <text start="114.14" dur="4.95">maneuver to sabotage the functioning of</text>
  <text start="116.69" dur="5.37">the executive branch in reference to the</text>
  <text start="119.09" dur="3.66">Democrats so not a surprise for those of</text>
  <text start="122.06" dur="2.73">us who&amp;#39;ve been paying attention</text>
  <text start="122.75" dur="3.3">certainly if you&amp;#39;ve been online you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="124.79" dur="3.06">been seeing a lot of this corruption</text>
  <text start="126.05" dur="4.44">firsthand with things like censorship</text>
  <text start="127.85" dur="4.65">and the fake news versus the online</text>
  <text start="130.49" dur="4.17">narrative which is very different very</text>
  <text start="132.5" dur="3.84">stark different realities there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="134.66" dur="3.299">there&amp;#39;s the fake news world where</text>
  <text start="136.34" dur="5.13">everyone hates Trump and he&amp;#39;s this close</text>
  <text start="137.959" dur="6">to being I am peached which I can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="141.47" dur="4.26">on YouTube anymore and then there is of</text>
  <text start="143.959" dur="3.901">course the other world of reality where</text>
  <text start="145.73" dur="4.08">you know about 74 or 75 percent of the</text>
  <text start="147.86" dur="3.51">country stand with him I think the</text>
  <text start="149.81" dur="4.05">Democrats are trying to overthrow him</text>
  <text start="151.37" dur="5.22">that the media is in on it and big tech</text>
  <text start="153.86" dur="5.64">is covering it up so we&amp;#39;re pretty close</text>
  <text start="156.59" dur="4.83">to victory here I think but anyway we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="159.5" dur="4.2">come to a couple of other major points</text>
  <text start="161.42" dur="4.25">here as well no this one is that</text>
  <text start="163.7" dur="5.039">certainly not a victory for justice</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="5.71">David Allen to pay Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="168.739" dur="4.771">almost a million dollars for exposing</text>
  <text start="171.38" dur="3.84">its aborted baby parts Ailes apparently</text>
  <text start="173.51" dur="4.02">he&amp;#39;s done damage to their business I</text>
  <text start="175.22" dur="5.28">guess and now has to pay the price for</text>
  <text start="177.53" dur="5.1">telling us what they&amp;#39;re doing alright</text>
  <text start="180.5" dur="5.37">fine but at least his soul will remain</text>
  <text start="182.63" dur="4.98">clean and his conscience clear this was</text>
  <text start="185.87" dur="4.95">still a victory for justice in my eyes</text>
  <text start="187.61" dur="6">whatever the courts say and we&amp;#39;ll get to</text>
  <text start="190.82" dur="4.62">some of the courts good news at least in</text>
  <text start="193.61" dur="4.14">a minute where we have president Trump</text>
  <text start="195.44" dur="4.829">stacking the second court of a Circuit</text>
  <text start="197.75" dur="3.989">Court of Appeals anyway now I wanted to</text>
  <text start="200.269" dur="3.541">talk a little bit about what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="201.739" dur="6.361">in the hearings we&amp;#39;re gonna save most of</text>
  <text start="203.81" dur="6">the InP each meant stuff before the next</text>
  <text start="208.1" dur="3.419">video over on bitch chute because we</text>
  <text start="209.81" dur="3.72">can&amp;#39;t cover that on YouTube anymore but</text>
  <text start="211.519" dur="4.291">you know a little bit kind of on the</text>
  <text start="213.53" dur="5.09">tertiary of that is uh you know you</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="6.03">Voinovich or she&amp;#39;s basically saying that</text>
  <text start="218.62" dur="4.839">she felt bad about losing her job and</text>
  <text start="221.84" dur="4.26">she was an ambassador everything else</text>
  <text start="223.459" dur="4.651">will you know flashback and and barack</text>
  <text start="226.1" dur="3.18">obama was just one of many examples in</text>
  <text start="228.11" dur="3.12">fact where it was actually kind of</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="4.2">standard protocol for ambassadors to</text>
  <text start="231.23" dur="3.78">resign when a new president comes in and</text>
  <text start="233.48" dur="3.39">sometimes they get picked back up</text>
  <text start="235.01" dur="3.29">sometimes they don&amp;#39;t sometimes there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.87" dur="3.59">carryover when you need</text>
  <text start="238.3" dur="3.27">money to kind of hold the the spot for a</text>
  <text start="240.46" dur="3.39">while until finding a suitable</text>
  <text start="241.57" dur="5.04">replacement but it&amp;#39;s pretty standard</text>
  <text start="243.85" dur="5.34">protocol so just a quick mention not to</text>
  <text start="246.61" dur="4.2">spend it too much time on it but this</text>
  <text start="249.19" dur="4.92">one&amp;#39;s definitely worth it here you guys</text>
  <text start="250.81" dur="5.13">are gonna really enjoy this potential I</text>
  <text start="254.11" dur="3.09">won&amp;#39;t say potential this is something</text>
  <text start="255.94" dur="3.03">he&amp;#39;s been talking about the whole time I</text>
  <text start="257.2" dur="4.62">mean this is the guy that told Hillary</text>
  <text start="258.97" dur="8.82">Clinton because you&amp;#39;d be in jail anyway</text>
  <text start="261.82" dur="7.68">listen let&amp;#39;s check this one out and he</text>
  <text start="267.79" dur="3.96">brought it directly he should have seen</text>
  <text start="269.5" dur="3.72">The Whistleblower report on the call he</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="3.57">should have been asked to see the call</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="4.35">and when he sees the call he would have</text>
  <text start="275.32" dur="5.31">been he would have should have said well</text>
  <text start="277.57" dur="4.89">there&amp;#39;s no case here we also sent it to</text>
  <text start="280.63" dur="4.32">the Department of Justice after we</text>
  <text start="282.46" dur="4.5">received the whistleblower letter and</text>
  <text start="284.95" dur="4.74">they call back and they said this is</text>
  <text start="286.96" dur="6.56">absolutely fine nothing inappropriate</text>
  <text start="289.69" dur="6.09">said we got a perfect report on it and</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="4.99">just one other thing that nobody</text>
  <text start="295.78" dur="5.73">mentions Dan is that when I make calls</text>
  <text start="298.51" dur="4.65">to foreign leaders I know there are many</text>
  <text start="301.51" dur="3.51">people on the line I mean with my</text>
  <text start="303.16" dur="4.23">knowledge there are many people they</text>
  <text start="305.02" dur="4.98">could be as many as 25 people 20 people</text>
  <text start="307.39" dur="3.63">five people two people but there are</text>
  <text start="310" dur="1.919">always people because you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.02" dur="3.45">talking to the leader of a foreign</text>
  <text start="311.919" dur="4.471">nation and you even have a print eye on</text>
  <text start="314.47" dur="3.57">the call I say kiddo people in the State</text>
  <text start="316.39" dur="3.33">Department and you know all good reasons</text>
  <text start="318.04" dur="3.57">and probably some bad reasons because we</text>
  <text start="319.72" dur="4.83">have some bad people too really bad</text>
  <text start="321.61" dur="4.559">people but I knew that Mike Pompeo was</text>
  <text start="324.55" dur="3.98">on the call Secretary of State I knew</text>
  <text start="326.169" dur="4.531">that other people were on the call</text>
  <text start="328.53" dur="3.58">fortunately they transcribed the girl</text>
  <text start="330.7" dur="2.91">how about how would it be if they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="332.11" dur="2.7">transcribe this call I would have been</text>
  <text start="333.61" dur="3.809">in trouble I would have had all these</text>
  <text start="334.81" dur="3.99">guys lying about a call I would have had</text>
  <text start="337.419" dur="4.051">a whistleblower that people would have</text>
  <text start="338.8" dur="4.53">believed so if I got lucky that they had</text>
  <text start="341.47" dur="3.72">it transcribed these are professional</text>
  <text start="343.33" dur="4.71">people but if they didn&amp;#39;t transcribe</text>
  <text start="345.19" dur="4.83">that call I&amp;#39;d be at the mercy of people</text>
  <text start="348.04" dur="4.56">that are lying all over the place but I</text>
  <text start="350.02" dur="3.96">know her studies I know everybody&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="352.6" dur="3.36">the phone then so I know all these</text>
  <text start="353.98" dur="3.99">people who&amp;#39;s gonna say something bad</text>
  <text start="355.96" dur="4.22">when I know that maybe 25 people on the</text>
  <text start="357.97" dur="2.21">phone</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="4.799">recession with the Ukrainian president I</text>
  <text start="363.06" dur="4.979">said yes the new Ukrainian president I</text>
  <text start="365.159" dur="5.25">actually had two conversations with him</text>
  <text start="368.039" dur="4.021">I said we just released the other one</text>
  <text start="370.409" dur="4.47">today and you saw that was milquetoast</text>
  <text start="372.06" dur="4.349">also I think you probably heard Devin</text>
  <text start="374.879" dur="4.891">newness did a great job by the way his</text>
  <text start="376.409" dur="5.641">opening remarks were great but he just</text>
  <text start="379.77" dur="4.59">read that into the record because as you</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="4.35">know Schiff didn&amp;#39;t read what I said into</text>
  <text start="384.36" dur="3.6">the record he made up a conversation and</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="3.03">read that into the record that was one</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="4.65">of the most disgusting things I&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="389.43" dur="5.09">seen in politics and if he didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="392.61" dur="6.059">immunity he&amp;#39;d be in jail for what he did</text>
  <text start="394.52" dur="6.04">so so we totally watched that out of</text>
  <text start="398.669" dur="3.661">order my apologies I thought it was on</text>
  <text start="400.56" dur="3.569">the second part there it was actually</text>
  <text start="402.33" dur="3.48">the first part but both parts were quite</text>
  <text start="404.129" dur="3.811">interesting and brought some great</text>
  <text start="405.81" dur="4.38">context but just the he be in jail</text>
  <text start="407.94" dur="4.68">comment that&amp;#39;s gonna be a big winner for</text>
  <text start="410.19" dur="4.05">the day it&amp;#39;s gonna certainly troll out</text>
  <text start="412.62" dur="4.32">of Schiff a little bit and yeah the</text>
  <text start="414.24" dur="5.79">immunity thing it&amp;#39;s an issue and the the</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="5.34">secret you know Christmas iymp each</text>
  <text start="420.03" dur="3.84">meant plans things like that are an</text>
  <text start="422.28" dur="3.479">issue the censorship is certainly an</text>
  <text start="423.87" dur="3.479">issue because none of this stuff is</text>
  <text start="425.759" dur="4.491">gonna work if we&amp;#39;re all here pointing</text>
  <text start="427.349" dur="6.781">out how ridiculous it is and president</text>
  <text start="430.25" dur="5.77">TR UMP is able to to bounce that back</text>
  <text start="434.13" dur="3.719">and forth with us as he calls it out but</text>
  <text start="436.02" dur="3.09">what if it&amp;#39;s just him alone against all</text>
  <text start="437.849" dur="3.481">of those are the voices and there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="439.11" dur="4.02">one else out there to defend them that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="441.33" dur="4.11">what we&amp;#39;re looking at next with the the</text>
  <text start="443.13" dur="4.439">being bit burned and purged from YouTube</text>
  <text start="445.44" dur="4.259">which is coming on December 10th</text>
  <text start="447.569" dur="5.371">possibly as soon as that maybe even</text>
  <text start="449.699" dur="5.071">sooner who knows right anyway so if</text>
  <text start="452.94" dur="4.199">shift didn&amp;#39;t have immunity he&amp;#39;d be in</text>
  <text start="454.77" dur="4.5">jail damn right and it&amp;#39;s coming one way</text>
  <text start="457.139" dur="4.77">or the other because I think that his</text>
  <text start="459.27" dur="5.399">immunity must have some weaknesses</text>
  <text start="461.909" dur="4.461">clearly surely they&amp;#39;ve set themselves up</text>
  <text start="464.669" dur="3.9">with all these immunities and such but</text>
  <text start="466.37" dur="3.46">look there&amp;#39;s got to be a way to get this</text>
  <text start="468.569" dur="3.481">done within the balance of the</text>
  <text start="469.83" dur="4.44">Constitution for corrupt traitors and</text>
  <text start="472.05" dur="5.25">treasonous actors and pedophiles</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="5.579">possibly and because I do believe that</text>
  <text start="477.3" dur="4.019">he&amp;#39;s a pedophile as well looking into</text>
  <text start="479.849" dur="2.121">the standard hotel looking into some of</text>
  <text start="481.319" dur="2.361">the other</text>
  <text start="481.97" dur="3.9">allegations in this past it&amp;#39;s all really</text>
  <text start="483.68" dur="4.68">disturbing stuff and it bears uh some</text>
  <text start="485.87" dur="4.44">research now continuing on we also have</text>
  <text start="488.36" dur="4.29">this really good clip definitely worth a</text>
  <text start="490.31" dur="5.1">mention under the new price transparency</text>
  <text start="492.65" dur="4.74">rule we are finalizing today and it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="495.41" dur="4.52">be all final as it is finalized it will</text>
  <text start="497.39" dur="4.71">be put out today all of that will change</text>
  <text start="499.93" dur="3.82">hospitals will soon be required to</text>
  <text start="502.1" dur="3.99">publish the price of everything from</text>
  <text start="503.75" dur="5.34">individual medical supplies to the total</text>
  <text start="506.09" dur="5.25">cost of common procedures next we will</text>
  <text start="509.09" dur="3.9">bring much-needed price transparency to</text>
  <text start="511.34" dur="4.879">insurance companies I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="512.99" dur="6.27">thrilled this will allow you to see your</text>
  <text start="516.219" dur="5.621">out-of-pocket costs and other vital</text>
  <text start="519.26" dur="4.17">price information before you go in for</text>
  <text start="521.84" dur="3.06">treatment so you&amp;#39;re going to know what</text>
  <text start="523.43" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s going to be and you&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="524.9" dur="6.02">able to have lots of choices both in</text>
  <text start="527.66" dur="6.72">terms of doctors hospitals and price and</text>
  <text start="530.92" dur="5.98">we&amp;#39;re stopping American patients from</text>
  <text start="534.38" dur="4.89">just getting pure and simple two words</text>
  <text start="536.9" dur="5.13">very simple words ripped off because</text>
  <text start="539.27" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;ve been ripped off for years for a</text>
  <text start="542.03" dur="5.13">lot of years under the new price</text>
  <text start="544.4" dur="4.95">transparency rule we are and been ripped</text>
  <text start="547.16" dur="3.66">off for a lot of years and you know I</text>
  <text start="549.35" dur="3.84">saw my grandparents have to go through</text>
  <text start="550.82" dur="3.95">that I personally don&amp;#39;t put much</text>
  <text start="553.19" dur="4.2">credence in the medical system</text>
  <text start="554.77" dur="4.36">allopathic medical sick care system for</text>
  <text start="557.39" dur="2.94">the most part unless you&amp;#39;re on death&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="559.13" dur="3.39">bed and being rushed to an emergency</text>
  <text start="560.33" dur="4.35">room in which case it&amp;#39;s great they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="562.52" dur="4.14">keep you alive but any kind of long-term</text>
  <text start="564.68" dur="3.39">treatment they just make you worse it</text>
  <text start="566.66" dur="4.62">seems it just seems like they kill</text>
  <text start="568.07" dur="6.15">people with their drugs and non-stop cut</text>
  <text start="571.28" dur="4.65">poison but urn mentality that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="574.22" dur="5.01">they have to offer is cut poison burn</text>
  <text start="575.93" dur="4.86">and drugs that seems to be it for me so</text>
  <text start="579.23" dur="3.12">I avoid doctors like the plague and</text>
  <text start="580.79" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s why I got into holistic health</text>
  <text start="582.35" dur="3.3">care and and you know I got into</text>
  <text start="584.12" dur="3.36">learning how to do vitamins and</text>
  <text start="585.65" dur="3.57">supplements and I got into all of these</text>
  <text start="587.48" dur="3.09">interesting things because I wanted to</text>
  <text start="589.22" dur="3.84">do these supplements I couldn&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="590.57" dur="5.13">them all myself so I learned in in</text>
  <text start="593.06" dur="5.37">detail how to source the best quality</text>
  <text start="595.7" dur="6.54">bulk ingredients and how to you know</text>
  <text start="598.43" dur="6.12">create my own at-home sort of holistic</text>
  <text start="602.24" dur="4.08">pharmacy if you will it just different</text>
  <text start="604.55" dur="6.27">herbs and teas and things of that nature</text>
  <text start="606.32" dur="6.45">it&amp;#39;s pretty great anyway so it begins</text>
  <text start="610.82" dur="4.43">New Jersey Democrats introduced bill to</text>
  <text start="612.77" dur="5.96">pay reparations to African American</text>
  <text start="615.25" dur="5.37">so look this is a ridiculous way to</text>
  <text start="618.73" dur="3.45">create more division between the races</text>
  <text start="620.62" dur="3.39">the Democrats are always trying to drive</text>
  <text start="622.18" dur="3.15">this wedge to try to get more votes and</text>
  <text start="624.01" dur="2.58">more power and more money that they</text>
  <text start="625.33" dur="3.36">would of course then keep for themselves</text>
  <text start="626.59" dur="4.59">and give you pennies so it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="628.69" dur="4.56">another race baiting tactic and people</text>
  <text start="631.18" dur="3.42">are wake to this now I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="633.25" dur="3.42">really that big a deal I hopefully it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="634.6" dur="3.84">not gonna go anywhere and if it did all</text>
  <text start="636.67" dur="4.44">the white people would leave this state</text>
  <text start="638.44" dur="5.16">and then you would just be in with a</text>
  <text start="641.11" dur="5.22">useless dead law that doesn&amp;#39;t do any</text>
  <text start="643.6" dur="4.47">good and then you would also have lost a</text>
  <text start="646.33" dur="3.45">lot of good people in the state a lot of</text>
  <text start="648.07" dur="4.35">tax base and everyone would be worse off</text>
  <text start="649.78" dur="4.14">because people flee such tyranny and it</text>
  <text start="652.42" dur="3.12">just makes sense it&amp;#39;s called the flag</text>
  <text start="653.92" dur="3.93">there you go where they don&amp;#39;t treat you</text>
  <text start="655.54" dur="4.83">the bastard treat you better I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="657.85" dur="5.46">stay where they treat you like crap as</text>
  <text start="660.37" dur="4.65">in California for example great you know</text>
  <text start="663.31" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s a big debate a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="665.02" dur="5.34">leaving if you&amp;#39;re not a hardened warrior</text>
  <text start="667.18" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s a good time to leave right so um</text>
  <text start="670.36" dur="4.41">this one is leading up to some of the</text>
  <text start="672.79" dur="3.81">topics that I can&amp;#39;t talk about or an</text>
  <text start="674.77" dur="4.89">almost there not yet</text>
  <text start="676.6" dur="4.77">but this is close so the same corrupt</text>
  <text start="679.66" dur="4.05">hack attorney that was under Mueller</text>
  <text start="681.37" dur="4.46">went against Flynn isn&amp;#39;t still</text>
  <text start="683.71" dur="5.52">overseeing the flooding case and is now</text>
  <text start="685.83" dur="4.93">going after Rudy Giuliani of course to</text>
  <text start="689.23" dur="5.94">try to set him up that the same way that</text>
  <text start="690.76" dur="5.61">they did Flynn it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s one sick thing</text>
  <text start="695.17" dur="2.669">after another of course what just</text>
  <text start="696.37" dur="4.35">happened in Roger stone where he may</text>
  <text start="697.839" dur="5.631">spend the rest of his life in prison for</text>
  <text start="700.72" dur="5.19">some processed crimes which by the way</text>
  <text start="703.47" dur="4.99">if you look into the actual like</text>
  <text start="705.91" dur="4.53">statistics of how often people prosecute</text>
  <text start="708.46" dur="6.69">these perjury crimes to Congress it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="710.44" dur="7.08">like 0.1% or something or actually</text>
  <text start="715.15" dur="4.5">prosecuted if I recall that metric I saw</text>
  <text start="717.52" dur="4.47">it earlier but that should go to tell</text>
  <text start="719.65" dur="4.29">people a lot about you know how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="721.99" dur="3.96">applying these laws it&amp;#39;s probably almost</text>
  <text start="723.94" dur="4.77">always Republicans right it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="725.95" dur="4.86">enemies of the deep state it&amp;#39;s not about</text>
  <text start="728.71" dur="3.66">whether you liar or not clearly we&amp;#39;ve as</text>
  <text start="730.81" dur="4.74">Trump pointed out himself we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="732.37" dur="4.86">eight or nine verified lies on there</text>
  <text start="735.55" dur="4.71">Sian cluding the Clintons and Mueller</text>

  <text start="740.26" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s a page and the oars and everything</text>
  <text start="741.82" dur="3.45">else so it&amp;#39;s not about lying it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="744.43" dur="3.54">being on the wrong</text>
  <text start="745.27" dur="3.99">team that&amp;#39;s what gets you prosecuted and</text>
  <text start="747.97" dur="3.84">thrown in prison for the rest of your</text>

  <text start="781.3" dur="4.11">their active measures to ban including</text>
  <text start="783.91" dur="3.93">if a video comes out that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="785.41" dur="6.09">like for example the InP</text>
  <text start="787.84" dur="6.33">each meant topic which is why I&amp;#39;m saying</text>

  <text start="839.68" dur="4.71">Appeals which is another major victory</text>
