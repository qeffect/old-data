  <text start="55.64" dur="4.2">back and enjoy I wanted to talk about a</text>
  <text start="58.19" dur="4.26">few things Jim before I let you take the</text>
  <text start="59.84" dur="4.77">wheels you know you mentioned we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="62.45" dur="4.77">crisis mode with the bond market and</text>
  <text start="64.61" dur="7.399">something about infinite QE so I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="67.22" dur="4.789">let you run with that okay</text>
  <text start="72.19" dur="5.41">about five years ago I began with a</text>
  <text start="75.68" dur="5.88">number of forecasts and I&amp;#39;ll touch on</text>
  <text start="77.6" dur="6.54">them in a few minutes but they&amp;#39;re wide</text>
  <text start="81.56" dur="6.53">ranging having to do with dollar global</text>
  <text start="84.14" dur="7.46">boycott and introduction of the gold</text>
  <text start="88.09" dur="5.83">standard in its various components</text>
  <text start="91.6" dur="4.6">difficulties with the petro dollar and</text>
  <text start="93.92" dur="8.1">the Saudis and a lot of different things</text>
  <text start="96.2" dur="12.239">and those forecasts I began honor around</text>
  <text start="102.02" dur="9.9">honor about as a 2014 and it was an</text>
  <text start="108.439" dur="7.191">interesting time because they were bold</text>
  <text start="111.92" dur="6.989">statements extremely bold statements</text>
  <text start="115.63" dur="6.309">like for instance Germany would flip</text>
  <text start="118.909" dur="6.331">east I made that two months after the</text>
  <text start="121.939" dur="5.521">Russian sanctions came in following the</text>
  <text start="125.24" dur="7.08">Ukraine war and there&amp;#39;s really nothing</text>
  <text start="127.46" dur="6.33">legitimate about either so I remember</text>
  <text start="132.32" dur="2.91">you saying that actually and I remember</text>
  <text start="133.79" dur="3.419">kind of agreeing with it because I could</text>
  <text start="135.23" dur="3.78">see some of the pattern on the wall with</text>
  <text start="137.209" dur="4.711">the waning Russia was setting place you</text>
  <text start="139.01" dur="5.34">could see the future and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="141.92" dur="5.099">just say oh gosh is there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="144.35" dur="5.3">evident on that that&amp;#39;s so lunatic Jim</text>
  <text start="147.019" dur="5.491">and I said the Germans are proud people</text>
  <text start="149.65" dur="5.54">they&amp;#39;re successful people they&amp;#39;re one of</text>
  <text start="152.51" dur="5.74">the only quite</text>
  <text start="155.19" dur="6.8">race you know Caucasian society and</text>
  <text start="158.25" dur="7.14">economy that has a trade surplus wake up</text>
  <text start="161.99" dur="5.14">and one item after another began to</text>
  <text start="165.39" dur="4.41">happen and I said this is gonna take</text>
  <text start="167.13" dur="5.21">three or four years and it did okay but</text>
  <text start="169.8" dur="6.72">there&amp;#39;s something going on right now</text>
  <text start="172.34" dur="6.91">that is frightening and it is the bond</text>
  <text start="176.52" dur="5.49">market doing what I expected</text>
  <text start="179.25" dur="5.01">several months ago okay remember it was</text>
  <text start="182.01" dur="6.18">around the turn of the year when General</text>
  <text start="184.26" dur="8.73">Electric GE had its uh its corporate</text>
  <text start="188.19" dur="7.08">bond go to triple B and I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="192.99" dur="3.99">explain quickly I&amp;#39;m probably repeating</text>
  <text start="195.27" dur="5.91">from a past interview but that&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="196.98" dur="8.16">just quickly when a good standard I call</text>
  <text start="201.18" dur="6.57">them stalwart when a stalwart firm goes</text>
  <text start="205.14" dur="7.47">to triple B in their corporate bond</text>
  <text start="207.75" dur="5.91">rating there&amp;#39;s a name for it we call it</text>
  <text start="212.61" dur="3.54">a fallen angel</text>
  <text start="213.66" dur="6.72">it means it&amp;#39;s more difficult from that</text>
  <text start="216.15" dur="7.26">point onward for them to attract funds</text>
  <text start="220.38" dur="5.31">to issue bonds to fund their corporate</text>
  <text start="223.41" dur="4.38">debt and remember these corporations are</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="3.84">abusing the corporate debt and have been</text>
  <text start="227.79" dur="4.26">for two years they&amp;#39;ve been issuing bonds</text>
  <text start="229.53" dur="3.9">and buying back their stock and now</text>
  <text start="232.05" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to stop that so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="4.47">an extra risk to the stock market okay</text>
  <text start="235.68" dur="5.94">when when this happened the fallen angel</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="7.17">concept came into vogue and I found it</text>
  <text start="241.62" dur="5.85">fascinating because this is not standard</text>
  <text start="245.07" dur="4.59">when I started the newsletter in 2004</text>
  <text start="247.47" dur="5.91">General Electric was the king of kings</text>
  <text start="249.66" dur="5.72">in the corporate market in the corporate</text>
  <text start="253.38" dur="4.56">financial sector there they were</text>
  <text start="255.38" dur="5.44">complemented as saying well they always</text>
  <text start="257.94" dur="4.53">meet their earnings they manage their</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="3.33">earnings well they&amp;#39;re the best at</text>
  <text start="262.47" dur="4.05">managing derivatives they&amp;#39;re the most</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="4.05">successful financial firm outside the</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="3.72">banking industry and now they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="268.2" dur="3.84">fallen angel and I thought oh my gosh</text>
  <text start="270.24" dur="4.32">this is going to get a lot worse for</text>
  <text start="272.04" dur="5.55">dozens and dozens of big names than</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="6.48">General Motors was next okay so that was</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="5.19">the beginning of the clue that the bond</text>
  <text start="281.04" dur="4.41">market was in trouble and then you had</text>
  <text start="282.78" dur="5.35">the revelation that 22 Billy a trillion</text>
  <text start="285.45" dur="5.54">sorry trillion dollars was missing</text>
  <text start="288.13" dur="4.42">from oh gosh I can&amp;#39;t remember the name</text>
  <text start="290.99" dur="3.69">of the fellow I know he&amp;#39;s from Michigan</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="6.84">State University but he and Catherine</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="7.23">Fitz publicize this and they really just</text>
  <text start="299.39" dur="4.35">focused on I think for departments</text>
  <text start="301.91" dur="3.57">there&amp;#39;s the Treasury Department the</text>
  <text start="303.74" dur="4.58">State Department Health and Human</text>
  <text start="305.48" dur="5.52">Services which contains Fannie Mae and</text>
  <text start="308.32" dur="4.6">the Defense Department and I honestly</text>
  <text start="311" dur="4.56">believe the Defense Department is</text>
  <text start="312.92" dur="5.49">responsible for close to half of all the</text>
  <text start="315.56" dur="5.58">22 trillion missing and they obstruct</text>
  <text start="318.41" dur="6.87">every single financial audit for the</text>
  <text start="321.14" dur="7.11">last 15 years they attempt they they</text>
  <text start="325.28" dur="5.22">pretend to cooperate but then it becomes</text>
  <text start="328.25" dur="5.61">impossible then the auditing firm backs</text>
  <text start="330.5" dur="6.81">out ok so then then came to Dee</text>
  <text start="333.86" dur="5.94">dollarization that&amp;#39;s not new this year</text>
  <text start="337.31" dur="5.64">but the Dee dollarization picked up a</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="5.04">lot of momentum this year and then then</text>
  <text start="342.95" dur="4.89">you had trouble with the Saudis and that</text>
  <text start="344.84" dur="4.83">their Aramco I P oh that just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="347.84" dur="3.99">happen I still think it&amp;#39;s gonna have</text>
  <text start="349.67" dur="4.17">trouble happening I said a year ago it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.83" dur="3.39">not going to happen now I&amp;#39;m saying I</text>
  <text start="353.84" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s gonna be difficult to</text>
  <text start="355.22" dur="6.21">happen and the US with Trump announced</text>
  <text start="358.58" dur="7.71">that the the three trillion a three</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="6.84">thousand billion dollars of saudi-owned</text>
  <text start="366.29" dur="3.93">Treasury bonds would not be made</text>
  <text start="368.27" dur="5.73">available for the Saudis who are having</text>
  <text start="370.22" dur="6.39">a cash crunch that&amp;#39;s called a theft</text>
  <text start="374" dur="6.75">that&amp;#39;s called US government pilferage</text>
  <text start="376.61" dur="7.29">but it might have been under contract</text>
  <text start="380.75" dur="5.88">with the Saudis and Kissinger and the US</text>
  <text start="383.9" dur="6.14">government at the time that might have</text>
  <text start="386.63" dur="6.68">been the contract for the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="390.04" dur="6.6">structure we don&amp;#39;t know we&amp;#39;re just the</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="6.92">unwashed plebeians and I kind of like</text>
  <text start="396.64" dur="7.53">being in that status okay um</text>
  <text start="400.23" dur="8.8">then we get things like oh gosh the</text>
  <text start="404.17" dur="7.56">falsified US government annual deficit</text>
  <text start="409.03" dur="5.25">report annual accounting report that</text>
  <text start="411.73" dur="4.68">said it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like 600 billion and</text>
  <text start="414.28" dur="6.24">deficit but if you subtract</text>
  <text start="416.41" dur="6.03">I love napkin arithmetic take the debt</text>
  <text start="420.52" dur="3.84">the total government debt now and</text>
  <text start="422.44" dur="4.86">subtract what it was a year ago and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.36" dur="6.12">a 1.2 trillion more so how can you say</text>
  <text start="427.3" dur="5.94">the deficit is 560 billion oh that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.48" dur="5.34">because of all the one-off all the</text>
  <text start="433.24" dur="4.05">one-off charges and I say well if there</text>
  <text start="435.82" dur="2.94">are lots of one-off charges and they</text>
  <text start="437.29" dur="3.6">seem to be regular they&amp;#39;re no longer</text>
  <text start="438.76" dur="6.42">one-off they&amp;#39;re two and five off or</text>
  <text start="440.89" dur="8.67">their regular components okay so we</text>
  <text start="445.18" dur="6.21">started to see a few months ago I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="449.56" dur="5.01">know exactly that there&amp;#39;s no timeline</text>
  <text start="451.39" dur="7.17">here but we started to see somewhere</text>
  <text start="454.57" dur="7.71">around April May June the evidence that</text>
  <text start="458.56" dur="7.68">we&amp;#39;re approaching a fiscal crisis which</text>
  <text start="462.28" dur="8.04">is the official official name for a US</text>
  <text start="466.24" dur="5.73">government debt finance crisis trouble</text>
  <text start="470.32" dur="4.59">in financing the US government debt</text>
  <text start="471.97" dur="6.74">which is directly reflected to the</text>
  <text start="474.91" dur="6.07">Treasury bond market now I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="478.71" dur="7.75">immediate</text>
  <text start="480.98" dur="8.58">Treasury bond items in my forecast list</text>
  <text start="486.46" dur="5.65">but I do have that the US Treasury bond</text>
  <text start="489.56" dur="6.12">is recognized as a global subprime bond</text>
  <text start="492.11" dur="5.76">and I I&amp;#39;ve seen in print to places where</text>
  <text start="495.68" dur="6.39">other analysts have used the term I mean</text>
  <text start="497.87" dur="7.29">golly how common was the term mortgage</text>
  <text start="502.07" dur="5.64">subprime bonds back in two thousand five</text>
  <text start="505.16" dur="5.79">six and seven and then we had the crisis</text>
  <text start="507.71" dur="6.84">in 2008 which I forecasted three to six</text>
  <text start="510.95" dur="5.19">months in advance the US for everyone to</text>
  <text start="514.55" dur="3.42">have a little historical context here</text>
  <text start="516.14" dur="4.38">you have a pretty good ratio of calling</text>
  <text start="517.97" dur="5.46">these things well in advance you know so</text>
  <text start="520.52" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s over 90 percent dustin and you</text>
  <text start="523.43" dur="3.81">know compare that with Wall Street</text>
  <text start="524.87" dur="5.25">analysts who have maybe 20 or 30 percent</text>
  <text start="527.24" dur="5.79">correct forecasts but with more boasting</text>
  <text start="530.12" dur="5.16">and and I like to interpret it very</text>
  <text start="533.03" dur="5.25">simply they&amp;#39;re not paid to have correct</text>
  <text start="535.28" dur="6.17">forecasts they&amp;#39;re paid to promote and to</text>
  <text start="538.28" dur="6.66">defend a party line to keep the bond</text>
  <text start="541.45" dur="5.86">inflows and the stock inflows coming in</text>
  <text start="544.94" dur="4.02">this this goes to your local bank or to</text>
  <text start="547.31" dur="3.6">like you know they&amp;#39;re trying to I</text>
  <text start="548.96" dur="4.14">remember doing a deposit one day and I</text>
  <text start="550.91" dur="4.38">saw a little old couple talking to the</text>
  <text start="553.1" dur="3.06">banker about investment options trying</text>
  <text start="555.29" dur="2.76">to pitch them on these different</text>
  <text start="556.16" dur="3.6">products that would give them a point</text>
  <text start="558.05" dur="3.93">something percent return every year and</text>
  <text start="559.76" dur="3.78">I just felt bad for them and I felt like</text>
  <text start="561.98" dur="5.12">this whole financial system it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="563.54" dur="7.32">predatory and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just lease top</text>
  <text start="567.1" dur="7.09">the little guys tend not to win what I</text>
  <text start="570.86" dur="5.82">there&amp;#39;s a term that I learned 20 years</text>
  <text start="574.19" dur="3.62">ago that Wall Street uses they call it</text>
  <text start="576.68" dur="5.31">paper</text>
  <text start="577.81" dur="5.35">we got paper coming in now what would</text>
  <text start="581.99" dur="3.36">you think that means like the New York</text>
  <text start="583.16" dur="4.95">Times and editorial and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="585.35" dur="6.06">spread it around the of it no paper</text>
  <text start="588.11" dur="6.8">coming in means dumb retail funds coming</text>
  <text start="591.41" dur="6.87">in that we can direct toward our</text>
  <text start="594.91" dur="6.91">selected funds and our recommended</text>
  <text start="598.28" dur="9.06">stocks which we exploit as a brokerage</text>
  <text start="601.82" dur="8.37">firm cash paper coming in okay so back</text>
  <text start="607.34" dur="4.85">three or four or five months we had the</text>
  <text start="610.19" dur="5.78">early evidence</text>
  <text start="612.19" dur="5.88">that a bond market crisis was happening</text>
  <text start="615.97" dur="5.37">now I describe the Fallen Angels but</text>
  <text start="618.07" dur="6.18">there&amp;#39;s another one that&amp;#39;s just as ugly</text>
  <text start="621.34" dur="6.3">and equally important to understand it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="624.25" dur="5.07">called zombies now I don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="627.64" dur="3.99">exact definition but let&amp;#39;s just you know</text>
  <text start="629.32" dur="5.7">cover it for layman&amp;#39;s interpretation a</text>
  <text start="631.63" dur="6.33">zombie firm is a firm whose cash flow is</text>
  <text start="635.02" dur="6.15">inadequate to cover debt service simply</text>
  <text start="637.96" dur="5.51">stated try now they would say it&amp;#39;s EBIT</text>
  <text start="641.17" dur="4.82">ah you know earnings before interest</text>
  <text start="643.47" dur="7.51">taxes depreciation and amortization</text>
  <text start="645.99" dur="7.84">that&amp;#39;s cash flow before main stuff the</text>
  <text start="650.98" dur="4.98">cash flow before main events for</text>
  <text start="653.83" dur="6.15">accounting purposes and propriety and</text>
  <text start="655.96" dur="6.63">filing purposes and regulations their</text>
  <text start="659.98" dur="4.35">cash is inadequate to cover their debt</text>
  <text start="662.59" dur="4.47">service so what do they do</text>
  <text start="664.33" dur="4.71">they issue more bonds and the bond</text>
  <text start="667.06" dur="4.2">issuance is to cover their debt service</text>
  <text start="669.04" dur="3.84">and other things and the last thing</text>
  <text start="671.26" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;d been doing with it to the last</text>
  <text start="672.88" dur="4.2">three years is investing in their own</text>
  <text start="674.86" dur="4.92">companies so this is a death knell for</text>
  <text start="677.08" dur="5.16">the economy in addition to the bond</text>
  <text start="679.78" dur="4.89">market which has fallen angels zombies</text>
  <text start="682.24" dur="5.67">and the extraordinary debt that the</text>
  <text start="684.67" dur="5.4">government must finance so what are the</text>
  <text start="687.91" dur="6.09">indications here let&amp;#39;s get to the real</text>
  <text start="690.07" dur="6.09">meat give you a preliminary when they</text>
  <text start="694" dur="4.59">started tightening three years ago I</text>
  <text start="696.16" dur="4.26">thought this is insane they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>

  <text start="700.42" dur="5.97">trying to test</text>
  <text start="702.46" dur="7.62">what&amp;#39;ll have it an actual on-the-job</text>
  <text start="706.39" dur="5.43">stress test and see how it goes and they</text>
  <text start="710.08" dur="4.86">were kind of late in recognizing that</text>
  <text start="711.82" dur="6.9">they were wrecking the system but in the</text>
  <text start="714.94" dur="5.79">process of testing they they raised the</text>
  <text start="718.72" dur="5.4">rates a little bit but then they kind of</text>
  <text start="720.73" dur="7.65">reversed it behind the curtain like</text>
  <text start="724.12" dur="7.14">jiggering with the repo making the</text>
  <text start="728.38" dur="5.64">reverse repo let me quickly cover them</text>
  <text start="731.26" dur="5.22">because these are important concepts the</text>
  <text start="734.02" dur="6.72">repo is essentially a bond purchase</text>
  <text start="736.48" dur="6.58">program in disguise it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s QE with a</text>
  <text start="740.74" dur="9.07">big cape around it</text>
  <text start="743.06" dur="10.38">a big cape repo is repurchase of</text>
  <text start="749.81" dur="6.39">Treasury bonds where the Fed will say to</text>
  <text start="753.44" dur="4.74">say citibank citibank you&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="756.2" dur="3.93">you got a cash problem in the last few</text>
  <text start="758.18" dur="2.69">days you you&amp;#39;re in a real pinch for</text>
  <text start="760.13" dur="3.27">liquidity</text>
  <text start="760.87" dur="4.27">we&amp;#39;ll buy back some of your Treasuries</text>
  <text start="763.4" dur="3.15">and if you want to make them short-term</text>
  <text start="765.14" dur="3.12">bill that&amp;#39;s fine doesn&amp;#39;t matter you you</text>
  <text start="766.55" dur="5.7">select the maturities we&amp;#39;ll buy back</text>
  <text start="768.26" dur="9.3">your bonds and we&amp;#39;ll give you cash okay</text>
  <text start="772.25" dur="7.23">well that&amp;#39;s kind of weird okay</text>
  <text start="777.56" dur="5.16">now when they did the rate hikes they</text>
  <text start="779.48" dur="5.37">did the reverse repos and this this</text>
  <text start="782.72" dur="6.15">addresses something completely different</text>
  <text start="784.85" dur="6.45">and dangerous the Fed would say we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="788.87" dur="3.39">have any bond buyers the auctions are</text>
  <text start="791.3" dur="3.12">about to fail</text>
  <text start="792.26" dur="6.03">our primary dealers are loaded to the</text>
  <text start="794.42" dur="5.73">gills and we need more buyers more</text>
  <text start="798.29" dur="4.02">demand for Treasury bonds we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="800.15" dur="4.62">more people we need more electronic</text>
  <text start="802.31" dur="5.87">demand so what we&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="804.77" dur="3.41">we&amp;#39;re going to sell you back</text>
  <text start="808.48" dur="7.14">the bonds and we&amp;#39;re gonna take your cash</text>
  <text start="811.44" dur="6.61">so that you can go fifty or hundred to</text>
  <text start="815.62" dur="5.49">one and leverage and buy a truckload</text>
  <text start="818.05" dur="7.74">more of Treasury bonds because we have a</text>
  <text start="821.11" dur="6.66">bond market crisis with absent demand my</text>
  <text start="825.79" dur="3.63">gosh how long can that last you think</text>
  <text start="827.77" dur="6.84">before that been going on for two years</text>
  <text start="829.42" dur="8.46">oh my gosh reverse repos so it&amp;#39;s best to</text>
  <text start="834.61" dur="4.83">think of an image and my image Dustin</text>
  <text start="837.88" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s kind of simple I think of the Sears</text>
  <text start="839.44" dur="4.89">Tower every time they do a reverse repo</text>
  <text start="842.71" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re saying to the banks we want your</text>
  <text start="844.33" dur="5.76">lobby to be smaller and we want 20 more</text>
  <text start="846.64" dur="5.37">floors and you&amp;#39;re not going to be able</text>
  <text start="850.09" dur="4.28">to withstand big winds but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="852.01" dur="7.17">we&amp;#39;ll manage the winds because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="854.37" dur="7.03">geoengineers hmm okay so get back to the</text>
  <text start="859.18" dur="6">bond market they&amp;#39;ve been doing the repos</text>
  <text start="861.4" dur="6.15">to hide QE which is bond purchase you</text>
  <text start="865.18" dur="5.16">know Zimbabwe bought their own debts and</text>
  <text start="867.55" dur="5.01">and we called it monetizing the debt and</text>
  <text start="870.34" dur="4.85">we said that&amp;#39;s deadly but when we do it</text>
  <text start="872.56" dur="6.26">it&amp;#39;s wonderful in advance and Keynesian</text>
  <text start="875.19" dur="8.22">excellence and sophistication backed by</text>
  <text start="878.82" dur="8.23">like what did greenspan call it risk</text>
  <text start="883.41" dur="6.49">offloaded yeah offloaded risk done</text>
  <text start="887.05" dur="5.52">really well in 2008 wasn&amp;#39;t it it</text>
  <text start="889.9" dur="5.82">resulted in QE and 0 / said afterwards</text>
  <text start="892.57" dur="4.92">gether was so successful I would say the</text>
  <text start="895.72" dur="3.42">law of unintended consequences but I</text>
  <text start="897.49" dur="3.15">think some of these are very predictable</text>
  <text start="899.14" dur="2.97">and they&amp;#39;re just sort of following the</text>
  <text start="900.64" dur="4.16">motions because they know it won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="902.11" dur="6.21">their problem is that correct you think</text>
  <text start="904.8" dur="6.63">yeah and you see it with a gradual</text>
  <text start="908.32" dur="6.41">decline in stature of the Fed Chairman</text>
  <text start="911.43" dur="6.46">like Greenspan declared it all wonderful</text>
  <text start="914.73" dur="6.85">the off-loaded risk a sign of financial</text>
  <text start="917.89" dur="7.37">engineering excellence and he actually</text>
  <text start="921.58" dur="5.36">left office a little bit early</text>
  <text start="925.26" dur="4.62">why did he do that why did he hand over</text>
  <text start="926.94" dur="4.8">the reins to Bernanke a little early</text>
  <text start="929.88" dur="4.32">because he saw a mess come and he wanted</text>
  <text start="931.74" dur="5.52">to get the hell out of town</text>
  <text start="934.2" dur="7.35">so Bernanke is a dumbass Princeton</text>
  <text start="937.26" dur="8.55">economics professor with a stupid PhD</text>
  <text start="941.55" dur="9.5">thesis that rewrote the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="945.81" dur="7.83">and how he explained in his own heretic</text>
  <text start="951.05" dur="5.65">fashion heretical fashion I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="953.64" dur="5.43">exactly what they called heretic own he</text>
  <text start="956.7" dur="3.78">explained and justified that the Great</text>
  <text start="959.07" dur="4.29">Depression wouldn&amp;#39;t have happened if we</text>
  <text start="960.48" dur="6.36">just printed more money okay then he</text>
  <text start="963.36" dur="5.28">gave way to Tim Geithner who is one of</text>
  <text start="966.84" dur="4.89">the biggest jokes ever to hit the</text>
  <text start="968.64" dur="6.24">Federal Reserve the New York fret and</text>
  <text start="971.73" dur="6.72">New York Fed head president whatever you</text>
  <text start="974.88" dur="5.4">call it and he had his own corruption</text>
  <text start="978.45" dur="5.58">with Indonesia and other things he was a</text>
  <text start="980.28" dur="5.88">Clinton tool so he gave way actually to</text>
  <text start="984.03" dur="5.34">someone who was higher in stature Janet</text>
  <text start="986.16" dur="7.71">Yellen who warned and lectured Greenspan</text>
  <text start="989.37" dur="8.64">and Bernanke no no and Dudley and Dudley</text>
  <text start="993.87" dur="7.26">the New York Fed had Dudley she Janet</text>
  <text start="998.01" dur="4.86">Yellen warned them that in a year -</text>
  <text start="1001.13" dur="5.91">we&amp;#39;re gonna have a crisis and she said</text>
  <text start="1002.87" dur="6.51">it in 2006 so they rewarded her and now</text>
  <text start="1007.04" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;ve got the the lowest ranking guy of</text>
  <text start="1009.38" dur="5.1">all Jeremy Powell who&amp;#39;s really gonna be</text>
  <text start="1012.23" dur="5.61">the bag holder all right so what is the</text>
  <text start="1014.48" dur="4.98">evidence of this severe crisis I want to</text>
  <text start="1017.84" dur="3.48">ask you about that Powell - with with</text>
  <text start="1019.46" dur="3.51">his interaction with Trump and how Trump</text>
  <text start="1021.32" dur="3.48">keeps calling out the Fed but but</text>
  <text start="1022.97" dur="4.77">continues yeah go ahead go ahead</text>
  <text start="1024.8" dur="5.159">I can I can wait on my my repo point so</text>
  <text start="1027.74" dur="3.959">for my perspective it seems as though</text>
  <text start="1029.959" dur="3.301">Trump is setting the narrative up that</text>
  <text start="1031.699" dur="4.351">the Fed is the bad guy when this crash</text>
  <text start="1033.26" dur="5.76">happens do you agree with that well yeah</text>
  <text start="1036.05" dur="5.37">because it was about eight to ten months</text>
  <text start="1039.02" dur="4.02">ago that everybody began to conclude</text>
  <text start="1041.42" dur="3.84">that quantitative tightening the</text>
  <text start="1043.04" dur="4.88">increase of rates and the buy and the</text>
  <text start="1045.26" dur="5.91">the soaking up and what&amp;#39;s the word the</text>
  <text start="1047.92" dur="4.78">discharge of the Fed&amp;#39;s balance sheet the</text>
  <text start="1051.17" dur="4.2">reduction of their balance sheet and the</text>
  <text start="1052.7" dur="4.68">tightening of rates it wasn&amp;#39;t working as</text>
  <text start="1055.37" dur="3.41">causing tremendous problems yet they</text>
  <text start="1057.38" dur="3.98">continued and</text>
  <text start="1058.78" dur="4.98">Pawel when he came into office might</text>
  <text start="1061.36" dur="4.71">have broken a promise we don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="1063.76" dur="5.04">the the background was but I suspect</text>
  <text start="1066.07" dur="4.08">Jeremy Powell made a promise okay we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1068.8" dur="3.24">stop this tightening we&amp;#39;ll begin to</text>
  <text start="1070.15" dur="4.08">lower rates but then he got into office</text>
  <text start="1072.04" dur="4.47">and and I don&amp;#39;t know what the the</text>
  <text start="1074.23" dur="8.63">cabal&amp;#39;s Genda is I think it is to break</text>
  <text start="1076.51" dur="9.2">the system so Powell got pressure also</text>
  <text start="1082.86" dur="5.89">Dustin from the Fed Funds futures</text>
  <text start="1085.71" dur="4.81">contract remember about two months ago</text>
  <text start="1088.75" dur="3.29">three months ago it was it was putting</text>
  <text start="1090.52" dur="4.44">in there pretty much a hundred percent</text>
  <text start="1092.04" dur="5.3">probability or 98 percent probability of</text>
  <text start="1094.96" dur="5.5">a double rate cut</text>
  <text start="1097.34" dur="6.15">and we only got one yeah the market was</text>
  <text start="1100.46" dur="5.13">demanding too and Trump was saying two</text>
  <text start="1103.49" dur="4.53">would be a good idea let&amp;#39;s get this</text>
  <text start="1105.59" dur="4.44">interest rate down because what Trump is</text>
  <text start="1108.02" dur="3.39">thinking Tom&amp;#39;s not just thinking in</text>
  <text start="1110.03" dur="3.75">terms of interest rate he&amp;#39;s thinking in</text>
  <text start="1111.41" dur="4.38">terms of weakening the dollar because</text>
  <text start="1113.78" dur="4.14">the dollar is becoming a global problem</text>
  <text start="1115.79" dur="3.99">and with if there was a double rate cut</text>
  <text start="1117.92" dur="4.55">of 50 basis points I think the dollar</text>
  <text start="1119.78" dur="7.86">might have weakened a little bit or</text>
  <text start="1122.47" dur="6.67">stopped its growth trend a bit and and</text>
  <text start="1127.64" dur="4.47">there a problem because the little</text>
  <text start="1129.14" dur="6.05">company the little countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1132.11" dur="5.55">having a huge problem with a weak</text>
  <text start="1135.19" dur="4.27">currency you just think of a small</text>
  <text start="1137.66" dur="5.34">nation like the Dominican Republic or</text>
  <text start="1139.46" dur="5.58">Turkey their currencies in trouble and</text>
  <text start="1143" dur="4.23">everything costs everything costs more</text>
  <text start="1145.04" dur="6.18">so they&amp;#39;re having price inflation okay</text>
  <text start="1147.23" dur="6.48">so you know I think Trump might have had</text>
  <text start="1151.22" dur="5.01">a handshake with Powell a long time ago</text>
  <text start="1153.71" dur="4.38">and that handshake I think has been</text>
  <text start="1156.23" dur="2.43">broken and I don&amp;#39;t know what the deal</text>
  <text start="1158.09" dur="3.6">was</text>
  <text start="1158.66" dur="6.3">and now Powell is making wishy-washy</text>
  <text start="1161.69" dur="5.79">dumb comments like we&amp;#39;re in the middle</text>
  <text start="1164.96" dur="4.41">of an expansion cycle middle of a growth</text>
  <text start="1167.48" dur="4.31">cycle are you kidding me we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="1169.37" dur="5.25">eighth inning of our economic collapse</text>
  <text start="1171.79" dur="5.83">there&amp;#39;s no better way to call this in</text>
  <text start="1174.62" dur="6.06">late-stage economic collapse look at the</text>
  <text start="1177.62" dur="6.45">trucking caste index look at electricity</text>
  <text start="1180.68" dur="6.45">usage look at gasoline usage look at the</text>
  <text start="1184.07" dur="6.44">labor participation rate going down down</text>
  <text start="1187.13" dur="6.66">down this is a deadly vicious recession</text>
  <text start="1190.51" dur="6.91">that I believe has had several years of</text>
  <text start="1193.79" dur="6.48">at least four or five percent decline if</text>
  <text start="1197.42" dur="6.09">you you know count properly the</text>
  <text start="1200.27" dur="5.01">inflation what they call the deflator if</text>
  <text start="1203.51" dur="3.39">we ate we were to look at all of those</text>
  <text start="1205.28" dur="3.03">different actions do you see any chance</text>
  <text start="1206.9" dur="3.51">that we may go back to a gold standard</text>
  <text start="1208.31" dur="4.44">under Trump&amp;#39;s watch well yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1210.41" dur="6.6">that&amp;#39;s clear to the climax of this whole</text>
  <text start="1212.75" dur="7.11">hour it&amp;#39;s what I mean it&amp;#39;s a ps/2</text>
  <text start="1217.01" dur="5.4">resistance among the 15 forecasts cuz</text>
  <text start="1219.86" dur="4.56">two or three of them directly relate to</text>
  <text start="1222.41" dur="3.42">that and a lot of people jump the gun</text>
  <text start="1224.42" dur="3.39">and say I don&amp;#39;t see any evidence we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1225.83" dur="4.05">going to a gold standard I don&amp;#39;t see any</text>
  <text start="1227.81" dur="3.33">currency can be gold back no no no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1229.88" dur="3.15">gonna be trade payment</text>
  <text start="1231.14" dur="4.56">okay but let&amp;#39;s get back to the bond</text>
  <text start="1233.03" dur="7.08">crisis because it feeds directly into</text>
  <text start="1235.7" dur="7.8">the gold standard as a solution what has</text>
  <text start="1240.11" dur="5.699">been happening partner with the bond</text>
  <text start="1243.5" dur="5.16">market that would make people conclude</text>
  <text start="1245.809" dur="5.191">we&amp;#39;ve got a crisis in the works this is</text>
  <text start="1248.66" dur="4.56">not working this is not going well well</text>
  <text start="1251" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;ll tell you to start with we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="1253.22" dur="6.48">bond auctions that have been failures</text>
  <text start="1255.32" dur="6.63">and we never had failures before we</text>
  <text start="1259.7" dur="4.71">would have a low ratio where you know in</text>

  <text start="1264.41" dur="4.62">Sachs the city would come in with pretty</text>
  <text start="1266.33" dur="5.28">strong bids but it would really be at</text>

  <text start="1275.72" dur="5.13">anymore what they done in the last two</text>
  <text start="1277.97" dur="6.089">months they&amp;#39;d been reverting resorting</text>

  <text start="1537.82" dur="5.56">maybe one or two people were murdered</text>

  <text start="1821.82" dur="7.08">with Wells Fargo okay here&amp;#39;s the main</text>
  <text start="1826.14" dur="6">main point I think the repo market is</text>
  <text start="1828.9" dur="6.659">getting out of control it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="1832.14" dur="5.22">overly abused and it just recently got a</text>

  <text start="2627.14" dur="3.69">talked before about how Russia or China</text>
  <text start="2628.58" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re dealing now in oil for</text>
  <text start="2630.83" dur="4.98">gold basically and they are now players</text>
  <text start="2633.44" dur="4.8">in the gold market as well in China so</text>
  <text start="2635.81" dur="5.49">you you kind of talked about the</text>
  <text start="2638.24" dur="4.86">leverage that they have over us in terms</text>
  <text start="2641.3" dur="4.86">of what they could do to sort of implode</text>
  <text start="2643.1" dur="4.47">our currency in our economy since we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2646.16" dur="2.64">in the trade war I want to I want to</text>
  <text start="2647.57" dur="4.35">touch on that like that&amp;#39;s a hot topic</text>
  <text start="2648.8" dur="4.77">right now Trump is fighting China you</text>
  <text start="2651.92" dur="3.93">know there&amp;#39;s this big hot trade war and</text>
  <text start="2653.57" dur="4.29">and and almost at this point a hot war</text>
  <text start="2655.85" dur="4.05">in some sense because you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2657.86" dur="3.81">making friends in the area with with</text>
  <text start="2659.9" dur="3.06">people like the howdy Modi rally which</text>

  <text start="2665.12" dur="4.83">patrolling near Taiwan in some cases you</text>
  <text start="2668.24" dur="4.11">know we&amp;#39;re sort of trying to constrain</text>
  <text start="2669.95" dur="3.93">the red dragon back in its in its</text>
  <text start="2672.35" dur="4.94">territory a little bit not gonna happen</text>
  <text start="2673.88" dur="5.82">exactly but at the same point you know</text>
  <text start="2677.29" dur="3.76">oftentimes trade Wars or currency wars</text>
  <text start="2679.7" dur="3.84">turning to hot Wars and hopefully that</text>
  <text start="2681.05" dur="4.44">won&amp;#39;t happen but though as we progress</text>
  <text start="2683.54" dur="3.72">you know you mentioned like they have</text>
  <text start="2685.49" dur="3.96">the gold standard there that&amp;#39;s a potent</text>
  <text start="2687.26" dur="5.52">weapon against us when do you see them</text>
  <text start="2689.45" dur="6.75">using that I think the Chinese have have</text>
  <text start="2692.78" dur="5.88">a multiple strategy let&amp;#39;s touch on some</text>
  <text start="2696.2" dur="8.24">of their main ones I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2698.66" dur="9.48">working to keep their Chinese currency</text>
  <text start="2704.44" dur="6.91">closely pegged to the gold price and</text>
  <text start="2708.14" dur="6.78">that might have ended you could look at</text>
  <text start="2711.35" dur="5.79">the the Chinese one base gold price and</text>
  <text start="2714.92" dur="7.5">for several months it was in a narrow</text>
  <text start="2717.14" dur="7.77">band that meant controlled so that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2722.42" dur="6.449">for the United States the Chinese are</text>
  <text start="2724.91" dur="8.07">also doing a gold trade launch like with</text>

  <text start="2732.98" dur="6.15">bilateral trade between China and Italy</text>
  <text start="2735.44" dur="9.69">and for all we know that could be the</text>
  <text start="2739.13" dur="9.63">portal for Italian ports for a European</text>
  <text start="2745.13" dur="5.79">Union trade with China so the Italian</text>
  <text start="2748.76" dur="4.47">gold trade note might be bigger than</text>
  <text start="2750.92" dur="5.04">just Italy or it could just be a model</text>
  <text start="2753.23" dur="4.22">for other nations in the EU that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2755.96" dur="8.13">another strategy</text>

  <text start="2776.09" dur="7.95">oil between Russia and China and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2780.35" dur="7.14">why you initially saw in Shanghai the</text>
  <text start="2784.04" dur="7.68">gold oil contract because the Russians</text>
  <text start="2787.49" dur="7.59">used it the Russian sold oil to China</text>
  <text start="2791.72" dur="5.16">and received gold as much as they wanted</text>
  <text start="2795.08" dur="3.42">and I don&amp;#39;t think they got hundred</text>

  <text start="2798.5" dur="6.27">hundred percent but the spur Bank sve</text>

  <text start="2807.47" dur="4.14">delivered the gold from the Russian oil</text>
  <text start="2809.99" dur="5.52">sale and furthermore there was a kicker</text>
  <text start="2811.61" dur="5.73">the Chinese weren&amp;#39;t just doing that they</text>
  <text start="2815.51" dur="4.47">were selling and dumping their Treasury</text>

  <text start="2887.95" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s a CIPS now the Germans have created</text>
  <text start="2890.44" dur="5.42">a new one it&amp;#39;s like a mushroom effect of</text>

  <text start="2900.91" dur="4.62">Treasury bond support in trade payment</text>
  <text start="2903.07" dur="5.12">remember the gold standard will come</text>
  <text start="2905.53" dur="5.94">first in trade payments</text>
  <text start="2908.19" dur="6.79">it&amp;#39;ll be gold payments for trade</text>
  <text start="2911.47" dur="6.12">obligations that&amp;#39;s the first evidence of</text>
  <text start="2914.98" dur="4.5">the true gold standard and you&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="2917.59" dur="5.34">in the gold trade note the gold trade</text>
  <text start="2919.48" dur="7.11">note can also be the backing for a</text>

  <text start="2926.59" dur="4.35">Austrians have a panda bond and I</text>
  <text start="2929.5" dur="3.8">wouldn&amp;#39;t be at all surprised if behind</text>
  <text start="2930.94" dur="7.86">the scenes it has a gold trade note as a</text>
  <text start="2933.3" dur="8.59">foundation so if the sovereign bond is</text>
  <text start="2938.8" dur="5.91">defaulted the Chinese can take the gold</text>
  <text start="2941.89" dur="6.66">okay so it&amp;#39;s a gold back sovereign bond</text>
  <text start="2944.71" dur="7.08">in effect hmm</text>
  <text start="2948.55" dur="4.44">I think go ahead I just want to say I</text>
  <text start="2951.79" dur="2.4">can see the appeal for that and going</text>
  <text start="2952.99" dur="3.54">into what we&amp;#39;re going into now you</text>
  <text start="2954.19" dur="5.07">mentioned earlier shift from let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2956.53" dur="4.47">get the debt to you know that that has</text>
  <text start="2959.26" dur="3.3">to be a good quality and then that</text>
  <text start="2961" dur="2.91">matters as well so it&amp;#39;s not just a</text>
  <text start="2962.56" dur="3.66">quantity thing anymore people are</text>
  <text start="2963.91" dur="4.92">starting to wake up to that game it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2966.22" dur="6.27">not it&amp;#39;s not the collateral it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2968.83" dur="5.64">carry yeah that was the phrase yeah I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2972.49" dur="3.81">sorry wrong it&amp;#39;s a collateral not to</text>
  <text start="2974.47" dur="3.18">carry the quality of the debt is</text>
  <text start="2976.3" dur="4.11">important not the yield</text>
  <text start="2977.65" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s the collateral not to carry we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2980.41" dur="6.63">okay we might be forced to offer more</text>
  <text start="2983.14" dur="8.19">and interest rate all across the</text>
  <text start="2987.04" dur="6.27">sequence of months but you know this is</text>
  <text start="2991.33" dur="5.43">a really tough question how negative can</text>
  <text start="2993.31" dur="6.66">the German bunt Bund go right now there</text>
  <text start="2996.76" dur="8.7">are about minus five tenths point five</text>
  <text start="2999.97" dur="8.28">fifty basis points can they go 2-1 can</text>
  <text start="3005.46" dur="4.62">they go 2-1 point three I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3008.25" dur="4.67">ridiculous one of the tough questions</text>
  <text start="3010.08" dur="5.23">coming up and I have an answer for it is</text>
  <text start="3012.92" dur="4.93">how negative can the</text>
  <text start="3015.31" dur="6.32">can the US Treasury bond go negative and</text>
  <text start="3017.85" dur="7.44">I say it might attempt to go negative</text>
  <text start="3021.63" dur="6.88">but you might get like a polar repulsion</text>
  <text start="3025.29" dur="6.82">it prevents it from happening when you</text>
  <text start="3028.51" dur="6.18">get close to zero it just won&amp;#39;t get to</text>
  <text start="3032.11" dur="5.1">zero it&amp;#39;s trying well if it moves away</text>
  <text start="3034.69" dur="4.53">tries to get to zero it moves away why</text>
  <text start="3037.21" dur="4.65">because it&amp;#39;s the global currency reserve</text>
  <text start="3039.22" dur="4.53">if you move towards zero you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="3041.86" dur="4.13">encourage foreign central banks to dump</text>
  <text start="3043.75" dur="4.59">their treasures and buy gold bullion and</text>
  <text start="3045.99" dur="5.02">that will force the interest rate back</text>
  <text start="3048.34" dur="4.92">up so when you get close to zero it goes</text>
  <text start="3051.01" dur="4.35">away moves away repels off the zero</text>
  <text start="3053.26" dur="5.07">bound but I think we&amp;#39;re going to keep</text>
  <text start="3055.36" dur="5.04">trying to move toward zero and what</text>
  <text start="3058.33" dur="4.65">might happen is our short short term</text>
  <text start="3060.4" dur="6">might go negative but the ten and thirty</text>
  <text start="3062.98" dur="5.43">year will never and and thus form</text>
  <text start="3066.4" dur="3.78">central banks might think well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3068.41" dur="4.8">just going to hold Treasuries short-term</text>
  <text start="3070.18" dur="5.52">for handling oil payments and trade like</text>
  <text start="3073.21" dur="5.19">container vessels but for our core</text>
  <text start="3075.7" dur="4.32">central bank foundation we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="3078.4" dur="7.67">keep them in long term and that&amp;#39;ll never</text>
  <text start="3080.02" dur="9.21">get negative so that&amp;#39;s another issue</text>
  <text start="3086.07" dur="6.61">this goal that this this bond market</text>
  <text start="3089.23" dur="7.06">unraveling Dustin it has the solution</text>
  <text start="3092.68" dur="5.35">and the only solution of</text>
  <text start="3096.29" dur="4.52">gold standard and let me just touch</text>
  <text start="3098.03" dur="5.52">briefly on the BIS the Basel plan</text>
  <text start="3100.81" dur="5.32">they&amp;#39;re actually talking about a new</text>

  <text start="3132.17" dur="4.83">rights they have five currencies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3134.75" dur="4.53">in there and they the Chinese just took</text>
  <text start="3137" dur="6.9">you know ten to twelve percent on the</text>
  <text start="3139.28" dur="6.66">hundred so Basel is saying that they are</text>
  <text start="3143.9" dur="5.46">going to produce a gold standard but</text>
  <text start="3145.94" dur="6.03">they somehow mix in the SDR they want to</text>
  <text start="3149.36" dur="4.44">keep their paper system and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3151.97" dur="3.69">going to work they could go gold back</text>
  <text start="3153.8" dur="3.9">and it&amp;#39;s not going to work with Basel</text>
  <text start="3155.66" dur="5.55">running the show because there&amp;#39;s a von</text>

  <text start="3193.72" dur="6.19">decentralization and Basel will offer</text>
  <text start="3196.58" dur="5.22">neither yeah exactly and that is the new</text>

  <text start="4109.19" dur="3.48">a better place and inform people of some</text>
  <text start="4111.53" dur="2.58">of the stuff that&amp;#39;s going on behind the</text>
  <text start="4112.67" dur="2.85">scenes because this is important people</text>
  <text start="4114.11" dur="3.66">need to know this this is the difference</text>
  <text start="4115.52" dur="4.77">between you being a third world family</text>
  <text start="4117.77" dur="4.2">or or not if things do get really bad</text>
  <text start="4120.29" dur="2.64">because you had this information you</text>
  <text start="4121.97" dur="3.39">were thinking about this stuff</text>
  <text start="4122.93" dur="4.98">my hope is the United States gets onto</text>
  <text start="4125.36" dur="5.64">fast track for reindustrialize</text>
  <text start="4127.91" dur="5.76">here was a 2016 campaign promise from</text>
  <text start="4131" dur="6.42">Trump and he abandoned it I regard that</text>
  <text start="4133.67" dur="6.51">as a bit of a treasonous act if not</text>
  <text start="4137.42" dur="4.029">treating us a bit of a very disloyal and</text>
  <text start="4140.18" dur="3.099">dishonorable</text>
  <text start="4141.449" dur="4.41">he might be waiting for the re-election</text>
  <text start="4143.279" dur="5.79">to get going with that but we need</text>
  <text start="4145.859" dur="5.34">30,000 new businesses a year I will get</text>
  <text start="4149.069" dur="4.531">his defense I will say you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4151.199" dur="3.81">fighting almost the entire cabal on his</text>
  <text start="4153.6" dur="3.54">own so he&amp;#39;s doing what he can he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4155.009" dur="3.361">fulfilled many of the promises and maybe</text>
  <text start="4157.14" dur="3.539">that one&amp;#39;s one of those that takes a</text>
  <text start="4158.37" dur="4.429">while to to come true I guess I think it</text>
  <text start="4160.679" dur="4.981">takes a long time to come true because</text>
  <text start="4162.799" dur="6.101">we noticed in the first few months of</text>
  <text start="4165.66" dur="5.429">the administration by Trump he increased</text>
  <text start="4168.9" dur="4.669">the military budget and he pretty much</text>
  <text start="4171.089" dur="5.491">let Goldman Sachs were on the show I</text>
  <text start="4173.569" dur="10.301">said that that to me was oh my gosh what</text>
  <text start="4176.58" dur="8.969">is this a Redux I&amp;#39;m sorry I meet it I</text>
  <text start="4183.87" dur="3.929">think that the military thing has been</text>
  <text start="4185.549" dur="4.141">you know mostly military or with Trump</text>
  <text start="4187.799" dur="4.141">in this sort of new struggle against the</text>
  <text start="4189.69" dur="3.569">Cabal so they&amp;#39;re kind of one team good</text>
  <text start="4191.94" dur="2.91">and a lot of that&amp;#39;s going to end up on</text>
  <text start="4193.259" dur="3.21">the border wall funding which you know</text>
  <text start="4194.85" dur="3.24">in and of itself is gonna you know</text>
  <text start="4196.469" dur="3">driving down illegal immigration and</text>
  <text start="4198.09" dur="3">kind of cleaning I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="4199.469" dur="4.411">stop illegal immigration at all there</text>
  <text start="4201.09" dur="4.26">know several hundred tunnels it&amp;#39;ll help</text>
  <text start="4203.88" dur="4.049">you know indirectly with some of the</text>
  <text start="4205.35" dur="5.31">jobs inside it it might be a good</text>
  <text start="4207.929" dur="3.991">psychological barrier to help a lot yeah</text>
  <text start="4210.66" dur="3.09">obviously you know you and I know</text>
  <text start="4211.92" dur="2.94">incentives so if you build a wall but</text>
  <text start="4213.75" dur="3">you keep the welfare state they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="4214.86" dur="6.66">find a way around under over through</text>
  <text start="4216.75" dur="6.179">whatever under and and we&amp;#39;ve seen them</text>
  <text start="4221.52" dur="3">actually break their own legs falling</text>
  <text start="4222.929" dur="3.451">across as they try to climb the wall</text>
  <text start="4224.52" dur="2.73">because they want that free stuff it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4226.38" dur="2.52">worth the risk</text>
  <text start="4227.25" dur="3.719">that&amp;#39;s why we have to cut off the free</text>
  <text start="4228.9" dur="5.15">so see it&amp;#39;s not so much that they want</text>
  <text start="4230.969" dur="6.601">to be part of the great American</text>
  <text start="4234.05" dur="5.34">capitalist success story if they want</text>
  <text start="4237.57" dur="4.5">the free stuff they want the free</text>
  <text start="4239.39" dur="4.45">education they want the free paycheck</text>
  <text start="4242.07" dur="5.28">welfare and they want the free health</text>
  <text start="4243.84" dur="6.33">care you know and it&amp;#39;s sad part of</text>
  <text start="4247.35" dur="4.8">trying to to create a stronger economy</text>
  <text start="4250.17" dur="5.22">here I think is gonna be greatly</text>
  <text start="4252.15" dur="5.4">indirectly helped out by the cultural</text>
  <text start="4255.39" dur="3.599">fixing of trying to to deep or some of</text>
  <text start="4257.55" dur="2.879">the millions of illegals that are here</text>
  <text start="4258.989" dur="3.091">already and I think that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="4260.429" dur="2.911">he&amp;#39;s building up to doing and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4262.08" dur="3.9">know if that&amp;#39;s gonna happen that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="4263.34" dur="5.25">move but he&amp;#39;s making deals with other</text>
  <text start="4265.98" dur="3.84">countries and such so you know I&amp;#39;m a fan</text>
  <text start="4268.59" dur="2.76">of a lot of what he&amp;#39;s doing I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4269.82" dur="2.879">support some of the things that Trump</text>
  <text start="4271.35" dur="3.57">has done I don&amp;#39;t like his executive</text>
  <text start="4272.699" dur="3.931">order about vaccines I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4274.92" dur="5.279">like any of that stuff at all how about</text>
  <text start="4276.63" dur="4.98">an asset confiscation asset confiscation</text>
  <text start="4280.199" dur="2.761">you know it&amp;#39;s interesting that right</text>
  <text start="4281.61" dur="3.3">after he put in the executive order</text>
  <text start="4282.96" dur="3.57">talking about that around human</text>
  <text start="4284.91" dur="3.9">trafficking and stuff that so many</text>
  <text start="4286.53" dur="4.05">people have stepped down you know right</text>
  <text start="4288.81" dur="3.78">after you know for example Eric Schmidt</text>
  <text start="4290.58" dur="3.599">the next day after the executive order</text>
  <text start="4292.59" dur="3.839">dealing with human trafficking and and</text>
  <text start="4294.179" dur="4.951">human rights abuses it was the next day</text>

  <text start="4299.13" dur="4.56">sense I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t like asset</text>
  <text start="4301.23" dur="3.63">forfeiture I think that&amp;#39;s yeah I think</text>
  <text start="4303.69" dur="3">that gives the government the power to</text>
  <text start="4304.86" dur="3.24">just name people whatever they want and</text>
  <text start="4306.69" dur="2.94">steal their possessions which is very</text>
  <text start="4308.1" dur="3.09">dangerous slippery slope that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="4309.63" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re doing however if they use it</text>
  <text start="4311.19" dur="5.19">against all the pedophiles first I think</text>
