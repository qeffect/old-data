  <text start="263.819" dur="3.451">of trying to co-opt the Q movement and</text>
  <text start="265.319" dur="4.591">use a lot of lies and a lot of weird</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="5.13">logic and a lot of people have been</text>
  <text start="269.91" dur="3.659">victimized by them and they don&amp;#39;t stand</text>
  <text start="272.4" dur="3.63">up for themselves because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="273.569" dur="4.021">have a big platform so it helps you know</text>
  <text start="276.03" dur="3.72">and I get pushback from my audience too</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="4.17">but it does help to be able to expose</text>
  <text start="279.75" dur="4.139">some of these folks when they are doing</text>
  <text start="281.76" dur="2.61">things like that because lies have</text>
  <text start="283.889" dur="1.981">contact</text>

  <text start="684.89" dur="5.97">should be trusted to lead or represent</text>
  <text start="688.55" dur="5.01">the Q movement which he&amp;#39;s trying to make</text>
